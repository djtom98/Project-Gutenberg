Loewenstein, M.D.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions,\r\nall of which are in the Public Domain in the United States, unless a\r\ncopyright notice is included.  Therefore, we do usually do NOT! keep\r\nthese books in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are now trying to release all our books one month in advance\r\nof the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.\r\n\r\nPlease note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till\r\nmidnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.\r\nThe official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at\r\nMidnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A\r\npreliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment\r\nand editing by those who wish to do so.  To be sure you have an\r\nup to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes\r\nin the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has\r\na bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a\r\nlook at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a\r\nnew copy has at least one byte more or less.\r\n\r\n\r\nInformation about Project Gutenberg (one page)\r\n\r\nWe produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The\r\ntime it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours\r\nto get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright\r\nsearched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This\r\nprojected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value\r\nper text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2\r\nmillion dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-six text\r\nfiles per month, or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000+\r\nIf these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the\r\ntotal should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year.\r\n\r\nThe Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext\r\nFiles by December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]\r\nThis is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,\r\nwhich is only ~5% of the present number of computer users.\r\n\r\nAt our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third\r\nof that goal by the end of 2001, or about 3,333 Etexts unless we\r\nmanage to get some real funding; currently our funding is mostly\r\nfrom Michael Hart\'s salary at Carnegie-Mellon University, and an\r\nassortment of sporadic gifts; this salary is only good for a few\r\nmore years, so we are looking for something to replace it, as we\r\ndon\'t want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person.\r\n\r\nWe need your donations more than ever!\r\n\r\n\r\nAll donations should be made to "Project Gutenberg/CMU": and are\r\ntax deductible to the extent allowable by law.

A MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE.\r\n\r\n    "Oh! \'t is hard, \'t is hard to be working\r\n        The whole of the live-long day,\r\n     When all the neighbours about one\r\n        Are off to their jaunts and play.\r\n\r\n    "There\'s Richard he carries his baby,\r\n        And Mary takes little Jane,\r\n     And lovingly they\'ll be wandering\r\n        Through fields and briery lane."\r\n                                  --MANCHESTER SONG.\r\n\r\nThere are some fields near Manchester, well known to the inhabitants\r\nas "Green Heys Fields," through which runs a public footpath to a\r\nlittle village about two miles distant.  In spite of these fields\r\nbeing flat, and low, nay, in spite of the want of wood (the great\r\nand usual recommendation of level tracts of land), there is a charm\r\nabout them which strikes even the inhabitant of a mountainous\r\ndistrict, who sees and feels the effect of contrast in these\r\ncommonplace but thoroughly rural fields, with the busy, bustling\r\nmanufacturing town he left but half-an-hour ago.  Here and there an\r\nold black and white farmhouse, with its rambling outbuildings,\r\nspeaks of other times and other occupations than those which now\r\nabsorb the population of the neighbourhood.  Here in their seasons\r\nmay be seen the country business of haymaking, ploughing, etc.,\r\nwhich are such pleasant mysteries for townspeople to watch: and\r\nhere the artisan, deafened with noise of tongues and engines, may\r\ncome to listen awhile to the delicious sounds of rural life: the\r\nlowing of cattle, the milkmaid\'s call, the clatter and cackle of\r\npoultry in the farmyards.  You cannot wonder, then, that these\r\nfields are popular places of resort at every holiday time; and you\r\nwould not wonder, if you could see, or I properly describe, the\r\ncharm of one particular stile, that it should be, on such occasions,\r\na crowded halting place.  Close by it is a deep, clear pond,\r\nreflecting in its dark green depths the shadowy trees that bend over\r\nit to exclude the sun.  The only place where its banks are shelving\r\nis on the side next to a rambling farmyard, belonging to one of\r\nthose old world, gabled, black and white houses I named above,\r\noverlooking the field through which the public footpath leads.  The\r\nporch of this farmhouse is covered by a rose-tree; and the little\r\ngarden surrounding it is crowded with a medley of old-fashioned\r\nherbs and flowers, planted long ago, when the garden was the only\r\ndruggist\'s shop within reach, and allowed to grow in scrambling and\r\nwild luxuriance--roses, lavender, sage, balm (for tea), rosemary,\r\npinks and wallflowers, onions and jessamine, in most republican and\r\nindiscriminate order.  This farmhouse and garden are within a\r\nhundred yards of the stile of which I spoke, leading from the large\r\npasture field into a smaller one, divided by a hedge of hawthorn and\r\nblackthorn; and near this stile, on the further side, there runs a\r\ntale that primroses may often be found, and occasionally the blue\r\nsweet violet on the grassy hedge bank.\r\n\r\nI do not know whether it was on a holiday granted by the masters, or\r\na holiday seized in right of Nature and her beautiful spring time by\r\nthe workmen, but one afternoon (now ten or a dozen years ago) these\r\nfields were much thronged.  It was an early May evening--the April\r\nof the poets; for heavy showers had fallen all the morning, and the\r\nround, soft, white clouds which were blown by a west wind over the\r\ndark blue sky, were sometimes varied by one blacker and more\r\nthreatening.  The softness of the day tempted forth the young green\r\nleaves, which almost visibly fluttered into life; and the willows,\r\nwhich that morning had had only a brown reflection in the water\r\nbelow, were now of that tender grey-green which blends so delicately\r\nwith the spring harmony of colours.\r\n\r\nGroups of merry and somewhat loud-talking girls, whose ages might\r\nrange from twelve to twenty, came by with a buoyant step.  They were\r\nmost of them factory girls, and wore the usual out-of-doors dress of\r\nthat particular class of maidens; namely, a shawl, which at midday\r\nor in fine weather was allowed to be merely a shawl, but towards\r\nevening, if the day was chilly, became a sort of Spanish mantilla or\r\nScotch plaid, and was brought over the head and hung loosely down,\r\nor was pinned under the chin in no unpicturesque fashion.\r\n\r\nTheir faces were not remarkable for beauty; indeed, they were below\r\nthe average, with one or two exceptions; they had dark hair, neatly\r\nand classically arranged, dark eyes, but sallow complexions and\r\nirregular features.  The only thing to strike a passer-by was an\r\nacuteness and intelligence of countenance, which has often been\r\nnoticed in a manufacturing population.\r\n\r\nThere were also numbers of boys, or rather young men, rambling among\r\nthese fields, ready to bandy jokes with any one, and particularly\r\nready to enter into conversation with the girls, who, however, held\r\nthemselves aloof, not in a shy, but rather in an independent way,\r\nassuming an indifferent manner to the noisy wit or obstreperous\r\ncompliments of the lads.  Here and there came a sober, quiet couple,\r\neither whispering lovers, or husband and wife, as the case might be;\r\nand if the latter, they were seldom unencumbered by an infant,\r\ncarried for the most part by the father, while occasionally even\r\nthree or four little toddlers had been carried or dragged thus far,\r\nin order that the whole family might enjoy the delicious May\r\nafternoon together.\r\n\r\nSome time in the course of that afternoon, two working men met with\r\nfriendly greeting at the stile so often named.  One was a thorough\r\nspecimen of a Manchester man; born of factory workers, and himself\r\nbred up in youth, and living in manhood, among the mills.  He was\r\nbelow the middle size and slightly made; there was almost a stunted\r\nlook about him; and his wan, colourless face gave you the idea, that\r\nin his childhood he had suffered from the scanty living consequent\r\nupon bad times and improvident habits.  His features were strongly\r\nmarked, though not irregular, and their expression was extreme\r\nearnestness; resolute either for good or evil, a sort of latent\r\nstern enthusiasm.  At the time of which I write, the good\r\npredominated over the bad in the countenance, and he was one from\r\nwhom a stranger would have asked a favour with tolerable faith that\r\nit would be granted.  He was accompanied by his wife, who might,\r\nwithout exaggeration, have been called a lovely woman, although now\r\nher face was swollen with crying, and often hidden behind her apron.\r\nShe had the fresh beauty of the agricultural districts; and somewhat\r\nof the deficiency of sense in her countenance, which is likewise\r\ncharacteristic of the rural inhabitants in comparison with the\r\nnatives of the manufacturing towns.  She was far advanced in\r\npregnancy, which perhaps occasioned the overpowering and hysterical\r\nnature of her grief.  The friend whom they met was more handsome and\r\nless sensible-looking than the man I have just described; he seemed\r\nhearty and hopeful, and although his age was greater, yet there was\r\nfar more of youth\'s buoyancy in his appearance.  He was tenderly\r\ncarrying a baby in arms, while his wife, a delicate, fragile-looking\r\nwoman, limping in her gait, bore another of the same age; little,\r\nfeeble twins, inheriting the frail appearance of their mother.\r\n\r\nThe last-mentioned man was the first to speak, while a sudden look\r\nof sympathy dimmed his gladsome face.  "Well, John, how goes it with\r\nyou?" and in a lower voice, he added, "Any news of Esther yet?"\r\nMeanwhile the wives greeted each other like old friends, the soft\r\nand plaintive voice of the mother of the twins seeming to call forth\r\nonly fresh sobs from Mrs. Barton.\r\n\r\n"Come, women," said John Barton, "you\'ve both walked far enough.  My\r\nMary expects to have her bed in three weeks; and as for you, Mrs.\r\nWilson, you know you are but a cranky sort of a body at the best of\r\ntimes."  This was said so kindly, that no offence could be taken.\r\n"Sit you down here; the grass is well nigh dry by this time; and\r\nyou\'re neither of you nesh* folk about taking cold.  Stay," he\r\nadded, with some tenderness, "here\'s my pocket-handkerchief to\r\nspread under you to save the gowns women always think so much on;\r\nand now, Mrs. Wilson, give me the baby, I may as well carry him,\r\nwhile you talk and comfort my wife; poor thing, she takes on sadly\r\nabout Esther."\r\n\r\n     *Nesh; Anglo-Saxon, nesc, tender.\r\n\r\nThese arrangements were soon completed; the two women sat down on\r\nthe blue cotton handkerchiefs of their husbands, and the latter,\r\neach carrying a baby, set off for a further walk; but as soon as\r\nBarton had turned his back upon his wife, his countenance fell back\r\ninto an expression of gloom.\r\n\r\n"Then you\'ve heard nothing of Esther, poor lass?" asked Wilson.\r\n\r\n"No, nor shan\'t, as I take it.  My mind is, she\'s gone off with\r\nsomebody.  My wife frets and thinks she\'s drowned herself, but I\r\ntell her, folks don\'t care to put on their best clothes to drown\r\nthemselves; and Mrs. Bradshaw (where she lodged, you know) says the\r\nlast time she set eyes on her was last Tuesday, when she came\r\ndownstairs, dressed in her Sunday gown, and with a new ribbon in her\r\nbonnet, and gloves on her hands, like the lady she was so fond of\r\nthinking herself."\r\n\r\n"She was as pretty a creature as ever the sun shone on."\r\n\r\n"Ay, she was a farrantly* lass; more\'s the pity now," added Barton,\r\nwith a sigh.  "You see them Buckinghamshire people as comes to work\r\nhere has quite a different look with them to us Manchester folk.\r\nYou\'ll not see among the Manchester wenches such fresh rosy cheeks,\r\nor such black lashes to grey eyes (making them look like black), as\r\nmy wife and Esther had.  I never seed two such pretty women for\r\nsisters; never.  Not but what beauty is a sad snare.  Here was\r\nEsther so puffed up, that there was no holding her in.  Her spirit\r\nwas always up, if I spoke ever so little in the way of advice to\r\nher; my wife spoiled her, it is true, for you see she was so much\r\nolder than Esther, she was more like a mother to her, doing\r\neverything for her."\r\n\r\n     *Farrantly; comely, pleasant-looking.\r\n\r\n"I wonder she ever left you," observed his friend.\r\n\r\n"That\'s the worst of factory work for girls.  They can earn so much\r\nwhen work is plenty, that they can maintain themselves anyhow.  My\r\nMary shall never work in a factory, that I\'m determined on.  You see\r\nEsther spent her money in dress, thinking to set off her pretty\r\nface; and got to come home so late at night, that at last I told her\r\nmy mind; my missis thinks I spoke crossly, but I meant right, for I\r\nloved Esther, if it was only for Mary\'s sake.  Says I, \'Esther, I\r\nsee what you\'ll end at with your artificials, and your fly-away\r\nveils, and stopping out when honest women are in their beds:\r\nyou\'ll be a street-walker, Esther, and then, don\'t you go to think\r\nI\'ll have you darken my door, though my wife is your sister?\'  So\r\nsays she, \'Don\'t trouble yourself, John, I\'ll pack up and be off\r\nnow, for I\'ll never stay to hear myself called as you call me.\'  She\r\nflushed up like a turkey-cock, and I thought fire would come out of\r\nher eyes; but when she saw Mary cry (for Mary can\'t abide words in a\r\nhouse), she went and kissed her, and said she was not so bad as I\r\nthought her.  So we talked more friendly, for, as I said, I liked\r\nthe lass well enough, and her pretty looks, and her cheery ways.\r\nBut she said (and at that time I thought there was sense in what she\r\nsaid) we should be much better friends if she went into lodgings,\r\nand only came to see us now and then."\r\n\r\n"Then you still were friendly.  Folks said you\'d cast her off, and\r\nsaid you\'d never speak to her again."\r\n\r\n"Folks always make one a deal worse than one is," said John Barton\r\ntestily.  "She came many a time to our house after she left off\r\nliving with us.  Last Sunday se\'nnight--no! it was this very last\r\nSunday, she came to drink a cup of tea with Mary; and that was the\r\nlast time we set eyes on her."\r\n\r\n"Was she any ways different in her manner?" asked Wilson.\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t know.  I have thought several times since, that she\r\nwas a bit quieter, and more womanly-like; more gentle, and more\r\nblushing, and not so riotous and noisy.  She comes in towards four\r\no\'clock, when afternoon church was loosing, and she goes and hangs\r\nher bonnet up on the old nail we used to call hers, while she lived\r\nwith us.  I remember thinking what a pretty lass she was, as she sat\r\non a low stool by Mary, who was rocking herself, and in rather a\r\npoor way.  She laughed and cried by turns, but all so softly and\r\ngently, like a child, that I couldn\'t find in my heart to scold her,\r\nespecially as Mary was fretting already.  One thing I do remember I\r\ndid say, and pretty sharply too.  She took our little Mary by the\r\nwaist and"--\r\n\r\n"Thou must leave off calling her \'little\' Mary, she\'s growing up\r\ninto as fine a lass as one can see on a summer\'s day; more of her\r\nmother\'s stock than thine," interrupted Wilson.\r\n\r\n"Well, well, I call her \'little\' because her mother\'s name is Mary.\r\nBut, as I was saying, she takes Mary in a coaxing sort of way, and\r\n\'Mary,\' says she, \'what should you think if I sent for you some day\r\nand made a lady of you?\'  So I could not stand such talk as that to\r\nmy girl, and I said, \'Thou\'d best not put that nonsense i\' the\r\ngirl\'s head I can tell thee; I\'d rather see her earning her bread by\r\nthe sweat of brow, as the Bible tells her she should do, ay, though\r\nshe never got butter to her bread, than be like a do-nothing lady,\r\nworrying shopmen all morning, and screeching at her pianny all\r\nafternoon, and going to bed without having done a good turn to any\r\none of God\'s creatures but herself.\'"\r\n\r\n"Thou never could abide the gentlefolk," said Wilson, half amused at\r\nhis friend\'s vehemence.\r\n\r\n"And what good have they ever done me that I should like them?"\r\nasked Barton, the latent fire lighting up his eye: and bursting\r\nforth he continued, "If I am sick do they come and nurse me?  If my\r\nchild lies dying (as poor Tom lay, with his white wan lips\r\nquivering, for want of better food than I could give him), does the\r\nrich man bring the wine or broth that might save his life?  If I am\r\nout of work for weeks in the bad times, and winter comes, with black\r\nfrost, and keen east wind, and there is no coal for the grate, and\r\nno clothes for the bed, and the thin bones are seen through the\r\nragged clothes, does the rich man share his plenty with me, as he\r\nought to do, if his religion wasn\'t a humbug?  When I lie on my\r\ndeath-bed and Mary (bless her!) stands fretting, as I know she will\r\nfret," and here his voice faltered a little, "will a rich lady come\r\nand take her to her own home if need be, till she can look round,\r\nand see what best to do?  No, I tell you it\'s the poor, and the poor\r\nonly, as does such things for the poor.  Don\'t think to come over me\r\nwith th\' old tale, that the rich know nothing of the trials of the\r\npoor; I say, if they don\'t know, they ought to know.  We\'re their\r\nslaves as long as we can work; we pile up their fortunes with the\r\nsweat of our brows, and yet we are to live as separate as if we were\r\nin two worlds; ay, as separate as Dives and Lazarus, with a great\r\ngulf betwixt us: but I know who was best off then," and he wound\r\nup his speech with a low chuckle that had no mirth in it.\r\n\r\n"Well, neighbour," said Wilson, "all that may be very true, but what\r\nI want to know now is about Esther--when did you last hear of her?"\r\n\r\n"Why, she took leave of us that Sunday night in a very loving way,\r\nkissing both wife Mary, and daughter Mary (if I must not call her\r\n\'little\'), and shaking hands with me; but all in a cheerful sort of\r\nmanner, so we thought nothing about her kisses and shakes.  But on\r\nWednesday night comes Mrs. Bradshaw\'s son  with Esther\'s box, and\r\npresently Mrs. Bradshaw follows with the key; and when we began to\r\ntalk, we found Esther told her she was coming back to live with us,\r\nand would pay her week\'s money for not giving notice; and on Tuesday\r\nnight she carried off a little bundle (her best clothes were on her\r\nback, as I said before) and told Mrs. Bradshaw not to hurry herself\r\nabout the big box, but bring it when she had time.  So, of course,\r\nshe thought she should find Esther with us; and when she told her\r\nstory, my missis set up such a screech, and fell down in a dead\r\nswoon.  Mary ran up with water for her mother, and I thought so much\r\nabout my wife, I did not seem to care at all for Esther.  But the\r\nnext day I asked all the neighbours (both our own and Bradshaw\'s)\r\nand they\'d none of \'em heard or seen nothing of her.  I even went to\r\na policeman, a good enough sort of man, but a fellow I\'d never\r\nspoken to before because of his livery, and I asks him if his\r\n\'cuteness could find anything out for us.  So I believe he asks\r\nother policemen; and one on \'em had seen a wench, like our Esther,\r\nwalking very quickly, with a bundle under her arm, on Tuesday night,\r\ntoward eight o\'clock, and get into a hackney coach, near Hulme\r\nChurch, and we don\'t know th\' number, and can\'t trace it no further.\r\nI\'m sorry enough for the girl, for bad\'s come over her, one way or\r\nanother, but I\'m sorrier for my wife.  She loved her next to me and\r\nMary, and she\'s never been the same body since poor Tom\'s death.\r\nHowever, let\'s go back to them; your old woman may have done her\r\ngood."\r\n\r\nAs they walked homewards with a brisker pace, Wilson expressed a\r\nwish that they still were the near neighbours they once had been.\r\n\r\n"Still our Alice lives in the cellar under No. 14, in Barber Street,\r\nand if you\'d only speak the word she\'d be with you in five minutes\r\nto keep your wife company when she\'s lonesome.  Though I\'m Alice\'s\r\nbrother, and perhaps ought not to say it, I will say there\'s none\r\nmore ready to help with heart or hand than she is.  Though she may\r\nhave done a hard day\'s wash, there\'s not a child ill within the\r\nstreet, but Alice goes to offer to sit up, and does sit up, too,\r\nthough may be she\'s to be at her work by six next morning."\r\n\r\n"She\'s a poor woman, and can feel for the poor, Wilson," was\r\nBarton\'s reply; and then he added, "Thank you kindly for your offer,\r\nand mayhap I may trouble her to be a bit with my wife, for while I\'m\r\nat work, and Mary\'s at school, I know she frets above a bit.  See,\r\nthere\'s Mary!" and the father\'s eye brightened, as in the distance,\r\namong a group of girls, he spied his only daughter, a bonny lass of\r\nthirteen or so, who came bounding along to meet and to greet her\r\nfather, in a manner that showed that the stern-looking man had a\r\ntender nature within.  The two men had crossed the last stile, while\r\nMary loitered behind to gather some buds of the coming hawthorn,\r\nwhen an overgrown lad came past her, and snatched a kiss,\r\nexclaiming, "For old acquaintance sake, Mary."\r\n\r\n"Take that for old acquaintance sake, then," said the girl, blushing\r\nrosy red, more with anger than shame, as she slapped his face.  The\r\ntones of her voice called back her father and his friend, and the\r\naggressor proved to be the eldest son of the latter, the senior by\r\neighteen years of his little brothers.\r\n\r\n"Here, children, instead o\' kissing and quarrelling, do ye each take\r\na baby, for if Wilson\'s arms be like mine they are heartily tired."\r\n\r\nMary sprang forward to take her father\'s charge, with a girl\'s\r\nfondness for infants, and with some little foresight of the event\r\nsoon to happen at home; while young Wilson seemed to lose his rough,\r\ncubbish nature as he crowed and cooed to his little brother.\r\n\r\n"Twins is a great trial to a poor man, bless \'em," said the half-\r\nproud, half-weary father, as he bestowed a smacking kiss on the babe\r\nere he parted with it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.   A MANCHESTER TEA-PARTY.\r\n\r\n     "Polly, put the kettle on,\r\n        And let\'s have tea!\r\n      Polly, put the kettle on,\r\n        And we\'ll all have tea."\r\n\r\n"Here we are, wife; did\'st thou think thou\'d lost us?" quoth\r\nhearty-voiced Wilson, as the two women rose and shook themselves in\r\npreparation for their homeward walk.  Mrs. Barton was evidently\r\nsoothed, if not cheered, by the unburdening of her fears and\r\nthoughts to her friend; and her approving look went far to second\r\nher husband\'s invitation that the whole party should adjourn from\r\nGreen Heys Fields to tea, at the Bartons\' house.  The only faint\r\nopposition was raised by Mrs. Wilson, on account of the lateness of\r\nthe hour at which they would probably return, which she feared on\r\nher babies\' account.\r\n\r\n"Now, hold your tongue, missis, will you," said her husband\r\ngood-temperedly.  "Don\'t you know them brats never goes to sleep\r\ntill long past ten? and haven\'t you a shawl, under which you can\r\ntuck one lad\'s head, as safe as a bird\'s under its wing?  And as for\r\nt\'other one, I\'ll put it in my pocket rather than not stay, now we\r\nare this far away from Ancoats."\r\n\r\n"Or, I can lend you another shawl," suggested Mrs. Barton.\r\n\r\n"Ay, anything rather than not stay."\r\n\r\nThe matter being decided the party proceeded home, through many\r\nhalf-finished streets, all so like one another, that you might have\r\neasily been bewildered and lost your way.  Not a step, however, did\r\nour friends lose; down this entry, cutting off that corner, until\r\nthey turned out of one of these innumerable streets into a little\r\npaved court, having the backs of houses at the end opposite to the\r\nopening, and a gutter running through the middle to carry off\r\nhousehold slops, washing suds, etc.  The women who lived in the\r\ncourt were busy taking in strings of caps, frocks, and various\r\narticles of linen, which hung from side to side, dangling so low,\r\nthat if our friends had been a few minutes\' sooner, they would have\r\nhad to stoop very much, or else the half-wet clothes would have\r\nflapped in their faces: but although the evening seemed yet early\r\nwhen they were in the open fields--among the pent-up houses, night,\r\nwith its mists and its darkness, had already begun to fall.\r\n\r\nMany greetings were given and exchanged between the Wilsons and\r\nthese women, for not long ago they had also dwelt in this court.\r\n\r\nTwo rude lads, standing at a disorderly looking house-door,\r\nexclaimed, as Mary Barton (the daughter) passed, "Eh, look! Polly\r\nBarton\'s getten* a sweetheart."\r\n\r\n     *"For he had geten him yet no benefice."\r\n                                  --Prologue to Canterbury Tales.\r\n\r\nOf course this referred to young Wilson, who stole a look to see how\r\nMary took the idea.  He saw her assume the air of a young fury, and\r\nto his next speech she answered not a word.\r\n\r\nMrs. Barton produced the key of the door from her pocket; and on\r\nentering the house-place it seemed as if they were in total\r\ndarkness, except one bright spot, which might be a cat\'s eye, or\r\nmight be, what it was, a red-hot fire, smouldering under a large\r\npiece of coal, which John Barton immediately applied himself to\r\nbreak up, and the effect instantly produced was warm and glowing\r\nlight in every corner of the room.  To add to this (although the\r\ncoarse yellow glare seemed lost in the ruddy glow from the fire),\r\nMrs. Barton lighted a dip by sticking it in the fire, and having\r\nplaced it satisfactorily in a tin candlestick, began to look further\r\nabout her, on hospitable thoughts intent.  The room was tolerably\r\nlarge, and possessed many conveniences.  On the right of the door,\r\nas you entered, was a longish window, with a broad ledge.  On each\r\nside of this, hung blue-and-white check curtains, which were now\r\ndrawn, to shut in the friends met to enjoy themselves.  Two\r\ngeraniums, unpruned and leafy, which stood on the sill, formed a\r\nfurther defence from out-door pryers.  In the corner between the\r\nwindow and the fireside was a cupboard, apparently full of plates\r\nand dishes, cups and saucers, and some more nondescript articles,\r\nfor which one would have fancied their possessors could find no use--\r\nsuch as triangular pieces of glass to save carving knives and forks\r\nfrom dirtying table-cloths.  However, it was evident Mrs. Barton was\r\nproud of her crockery and glass, for she left her cupboard door\r\nopen, with a glance round of satisfaction and pleasure.  On the\r\nopposite side to the door and window was the staircase, and two\r\ndoors; one of which (the nearest to the fire) led into a sort of\r\nlittle back kitchen, where dirty work, such as washing up dishes,\r\nmight be done, and whose shelves served as larder, and pantry, and\r\nstoreroom, and all.  The other door, which was considerably lower,\r\nopened into the coal-hole--the slanting closet under the stairs;\r\nfrom which, to the fire-place, there was a gay-coloured piece of\r\noil-cloth laid.  The place seemed almost crammed with furniture\r\n(sure sign of good times among the mills).  Beneath the window was a\r\ndresser, with three deep drawers.  Opposite the fire-place was a\r\ntable, which I should call a Pembroke, only that it was made of\r\ndeal, and I cannot tell how far such a name may be applied to such\r\nhumble material.  On it, resting against the wall, was a bright\r\ngreen japanned tea-tray, having a couple of scarlet lovers embracing\r\nin the middle.  The fire-light danced merrily on this, and really\r\n(setting all taste but that of a child\'s aside) it gave a richness\r\nof colouring to that side of the room.  It was in some measure\r\npropped up by a crimson tea-caddy, also of japan ware.  A round\r\ntable on one branching leg, really for use, stood in the\r\ncorresponding corner to the cupboard; and, if you can picture all\r\nthis, with a washy, but clean stencilled pattern on the walls, you\r\ncan form some idea of John Barton\'s home.\r\n\r\nThe tray was soon hoisted down, and before the merry clatter of cups\r\nand saucers began, the women disburdened themselves of their\r\nout-of-door things, and sent Mary upstairs with them.  Then came a\r\nlong whispering, and chinking of money, to which Mr. and Mrs. Wilson\r\nwere too polite to attend; knowing, as they did full well, that it\r\nall related to the preparations for hospitality; hospitality that,\r\nin their turn, they should have such pleasure in offering.  So they\r\ntried to be busily occupied with the children, and not to hear Mrs.\r\nBarton\'s directions to Mary.\r\n\r\n"Run, Mary, dear, just round the corner, and get some fresh eggs at\r\nTipping\'s (you may get one apiece, that will be fivepence), and see\r\nif he has any nice ham cut, that he would let us have a pound of."\r\n\r\n"Say two pounds, missis, and don\'t be stingy," chimed in the\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\n"Well, a pound and a half, Mary.  And get it Cumberland ham, for\r\nWilson comes from there-away, and it will have a sort of relish of\r\nhome with it he\'ll like,--and Mary" (seeing the lassie fain to be\r\noff), "you must get a pennyworth of milk and a loaf of bread--mind\r\nyou get it fresh and new--and, and--that\'s all, Mary."\r\n\r\n"No, it\'s not all," said her husband.  "Thou must get sixpennyworth\r\nof rum, to warm the tea; thou\'ll get it at the \'Grapes.\'  And thou\r\njust go to Alice Wilson; he says she lives just right round the\r\ncorner, under 14, Barber Street" (this was addressed to his wife);\r\n"and tell her to come and take her tea with us; she\'ll like to see\r\nher brother, I\'ll be bound, let alone Jane and the twins."\r\n\r\n"If she comes she must bring a tea-cup and saucer, for we have but\r\nhalf-a-dozen, and here\'s six of us," said Mrs. Barton.\r\n\r\n"Pooh, pooh, Jem and Mary can drink out of one, surely."\r\n\r\nBut Mary secretly determined to take care that Alice brought her\r\ntea-cup and saucer, if the alternative was to be her sharing\r\nanything with Jem.\r\n\r\nAlice Wilson had but just come in.  She had been out all day in the\r\nfields, gathering wild herbs for drinks and medicine, for in\r\naddition to her invaluable qualities as a sick nurse and her worldly\r\noccupations as a washerwoman, she added a considerable knowledge of\r\nhedge and field simples; and on fine days, when no more profitable\r\noccupation offered itself, she used to ramble off into the lanes and\r\nmeadows as far as her legs could carry her.  This evening she had\r\nreturned loaded with nettles, and her first object was to light a\r\ncandle and see to hang them up in bunches in every available place\r\nin her cellar room.  It was the perfection of cleanliness; in one\r\ncorner stood the modest-looking bed, with a check curtain at the\r\nhead, the whitewashed wall filling up the place where the\r\ncorresponding one should have been.  The floor was bricked, and\r\nscrupulously clean, although so damp that it seemed as if the last\r\nwashing would never dry up.  As the cellar window looked into an\r\narea in the street, down which boys might throw stones, it was\r\nprotected by an outside shutter, and was oddly festooned with all\r\nmanner of hedge-row, ditch, and field plants, which we are\r\naccustomed to call valueless, but which have a powerful effect\r\neither for good or for evil, and are consequently much used among\r\nthe poor.  The room was strewed, hung, and darkened with these\r\nbunches, which emitted no very fragrant odour in their process of\r\ndrying.  In one corner was a sort of broad hanging shelf, made of\r\nold planks, where some old hoards of Alice\'s were kept.  Her little\r\nbit of crockery-ware was ranged on the mantelpiece, where also stood\r\nher candlestick and box of matches.  A small cupboard contained at\r\nthe bottom coals, and at the top her bread and basin of oatmeal, her\r\nfrying-pan, teapot, and a small tin saucepan, which served as a\r\nkettle, as well as for cooking the delicate little messes of broth\r\nwhich Alice was sometimes able to manufacture for a sick neighbour.\r\n\r\nAfter her walk she felt chilly and weary, and was busy trying to\r\nlight her fire with the damp coals, and half-green sticks, when Mary\r\nknocked.\r\n\r\n"Come in," said Alice, remembering, however, that she had barred the\r\ndoor for the night, and hastening to make it possible for any one to\r\ncome in.\r\n\r\n"Is that you, Mary Barton?" exclaimed she, as the light from the\r\ncandle streamed on the girl\'s face.  "How you are grown since I used\r\nto see you at my brother\'s!  Come in, lass, come in."\r\n\r\n"Please," said Mary, almost breathless, "mother says you\'re to come\r\nto tea, and bring your cup and saucer, for George and Jane Wilson is\r\nwith us, and the twins, and Jem.  And you\'re to make haste, please!"\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure it\'s very neighbourly and kind in your mother, and I\'ll\r\ncome, with many thanks.  Stay, Mary, has your mother got any nettles\r\nfor spring drink?  If she hasn\'t, I\'ll take her some."\r\n\r\n"No, I don\'t think she has."\r\n\r\nMary ran off like a hare to fulfil what, to a girl of thirteen, fond\r\nof power, was the more interesting part of her errand--the money-\r\nspending part.  And well and ably did she perform her business,\r\nreturning home with a little bottle of rum, and the eggs in one\r\nhand, while her other was filled with some excellent red-and-white,\r\nsmoke-flavoured, Cumberland ham, wrapped up in paper.\r\n\r\nShe was at home, and frying ham, before Alice had chosen her\r\nnettles, put out her candle, locked her door, and walked in a very\r\nfoot-sore manner as far as John Barton\'s.  What an aspect of comfort\r\ndid his house-place present, after her humble cellar!  She did not\r\nthink of comparing; but for all that she felt the delicious glow of\r\nthe fire, the bright light that revelled in every corner of the\r\nroom, the savoury smells, the comfortable sounds of a boiling\r\nkettle, and the hissing, frizzling ham.  With a little old-fashioned\r\ncurtsey she shut the door, and replied with a loving heart to the\r\nboisterous and surprised greeting of her brother.\r\n\r\nAnd now all preparations being made, the party sat down; Mrs. Wilson\r\nin the post of honour, the rocking-chair, on the right-hand side of\r\nthe fire, nursing her baby, while its father, in an opposite\r\narm-chair, tried vainly to quiet the other with bread soaked in\r\nmilk.\r\n\r\nMrs. Barton knew manners too well to do anything but sit at the\r\ntea-table and make tea, though in her heart she longed to be able to\r\nsuperintend the frying of the ham, and cast many an anxious look at\r\nMary as she broke the eggs and turned the ham, with a very\r\ncomfortable portion of confidence in her own culinary powers.  Jem\r\nstood awkwardly leaning against the dresser, replying rather gruffly\r\nto his aunt\'s speeches, which gave him, he thought, the air of being\r\na little boy; whereas he considered himself as a young man, and not\r\nso very young neither, as in two months he would be eighteen.\r\nBarton vibrated between the fire and the tea-table, his only\r\ndrawback being a fancy that every now and then his wife\'s face\r\nflushed and contracted as if in pain.\r\n\r\nAt length the business actually began.  Knives and forks, cups and\r\nsaucers made a noise, but human voices were still, for human beings\r\nwere hungry and had no time to speak.  Alice first broke silence;\r\nholding her tea-cup with the manner of one proposing a toast, she\r\nsaid, "Here\'s to absent friends.  Friends may meet, but mountains\r\nnever."\r\n\r\nIt was an unlucky toast or sentiment, as she instantly felt.  Every\r\none thought of Esther, the absent Esther; and Mrs. Barton put down\r\nher food, and could not hide the fast-dropping tears.  Alice could\r\nhave bitten her tongue out.\r\n\r\nIt was a wet blanket to the evening; for though all had been said\r\nand suggested in the fields that could be said or suggested, every\r\none had a wish to say something in the way of comfort to poor Mrs.\r\nBarton, and a dislike to talk about anything else while her tears\r\nfell fast and scalding.  So George Wilson, his wife, and children\r\nset off early home, not before (in spite of mal-a-propos speeches)\r\nthey had expressed a wish that such meetings might often take place,\r\nand not before John Barton had given his hearty consent; and\r\ndeclared that as soon as ever his wife was well again they would\r\nhave just such another evening.\r\n\r\n"I will take care not to come and spoil it," thought poor Alice, and\r\ngoing up to Mrs. Barton, she took her hand almost humbly, and said,\r\n"You don\'t know how sorry I am I said it."\r\n\r\nTo her surprise, a surprise that brought tears of joy into her eyes,\r\nMary Barton put her arms round her neck, and kissed the self-\r\nreproaching Alice.  "You didn\'t mean any harm, and it was me as was\r\nso foolish; only this work about Esther, and not knowing where she\r\nis, lies so heavy on my heart.  Good-night, and never think no more\r\nabout it.  God bless you, Alice."\r\n\r\nMany and many a time, as Alice reviewed that evening in her after\r\nlife, did she bless Mary Barton for these kind and thoughtful words.\r\nBut just then all she could say was, "Good-night, Mary, and may God\r\nbless YOU."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.  JOHN BARTONS GREAT TROUBLE.\r\n\r\n    "But when the morn came dim and sad,\r\n       And chill with early showers,\r\n     Her quiet eyelids closed--she had\r\n       Another morn than ours."\r\n                               --HOOD.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of that same night a neighbour of the Bartons was\r\nroused from her sound, well-earned sleep, by a knocking, which had\r\nat first made part of her dream; but starting up, as soon as she\r\nbecame convinced of its reality, she opened the window, and asked\r\nwho was there?\r\n\r\n"Me--John Barton," answered he, in a voice tremulous with agitation.\r\n"My missis is in labour, and, for the love of God, step in while I\r\nrun for th\' doctor, for she\'s fearful bad."\r\n\r\nWhile the woman hastily dressed herself, leaving the window still\r\nopen, she heard the cries of agony, which resounded in the little\r\ncourt in the stillness of the night.  In less than five minutes she\r\nwas standing by Mrs. Barton\'s bedside, relieving the terrified Mary,\r\nwho went about where she was told like an automaton; her eyes\r\ntearless, her face calm, though deadly pale, and uttering no sound,\r\nexcept when her teeth chattered for very nervousness.\r\n\r\nThe cries grew worse.\r\n\r\nThe doctor was very long in hearing the repeated rings at his\r\nnight-bell, and still longer in understanding who it was that made\r\nthis sudden call upon his services; and then he begged Barton just\r\nto wait while he dressed himself, in order that no time might be\r\nlost in finding the court and house.  Barton absolutely stamped with\r\nimpatience, outside the doctor\'s door, before he came down; and\r\nwalked so fast homewards, that the medical man several times asked\r\nhim to go slower.\r\n\r\n"Is she so very bad?" asked he.\r\n\r\n"Worse, much worser than I ever saw her before," replied John.\r\n\r\nNo! she was not--she was at peace.  The cries were still for ever.\r\nJohn had no time for listening.  He opened the latched door, stayed\r\nnot to light a candle for the mere ceremony of showing his companion\r\nup the stairs, so well known to himself; but, in two minutes, was in\r\nthe room, where lay the dead wife, whom he had loved with all the\r\npower of his strong heart.  The doctor stumbled upstairs by the\r\nfire-light, and met the awe-struck look of the neighbour, which at\r\nonce told him the state of things.  The room was still, as he, with\r\nhabitual tiptoe step, approached the poor frail body, that nothing\r\nnow could more disturb.  Her daughter knelt by the bedside, her face\r\nburied in the clothes, which were almost crammed into her mouth, to\r\nkeep down the choking sobs.  The husband stood like one stupefied.\r\nThe doctor questioned the neighbour in whispers, and then\r\napproaching Barton, said, "You must go downstairs.  This is a great\r\nshock, but bear it like a man.  Go down."\r\n\r\nHe went mechanically and sat down on the first chair.  He had no\r\nhope.  The look of death was too clear upon her face.  Still, when\r\nhe heard one or two unusual noises, the thought burst on him that it\r\nmight only be a trance, a fit, a--he did not well know what--but not\r\ndeath!  Oh, not death!  And he was starting up to go up-stairs\r\nagain, when the doctor\'s heavy cautious creaking footstep was heard\r\non the stairs.  Then he knew what it really was in the chamber\r\nabove.\r\n\r\n"Nothing could have saved her--there has been some shock to the\r\nsystem"--and so he went on, but to unheeding ears, which yet\r\nretained his words to ponder on; words not for immediate use in\r\nconveying sense, but to be laid by, in the store-house of memory,\r\nfor a more convenient season.  The doctor, seeing the state of the\r\ncase, grieved for the man; and, very sleepy, thought it best to go,\r\nand accordingly wished him good-night--but there was no answer, so\r\nhe let himself out; and Barton sat on, like a stock or a stone, so\r\nrigid, so still.  He heard the sounds above, too, and knew what they\r\nmeant.  He heard the stiff unseasoned drawer, in which his wife kept\r\nher clothes, pulled open.  He saw the neighbour come down, and\r\nblunder about in search of soap and water.  He knew well what she\r\nwanted, and WHY she wanted them, but he did not speak nor offer to\r\nhelp.  At last she went, with some kindly meant words (a text of\r\ncomfort, which fell upon a deafened ear), and something about\r\n"Mary," but which Mary, in his bewildered state, he could not tell.\r\n\r\nHe tried to realise it--to think it possible.  And then his mind\r\nwandered off to other days, to far different times.  He thought of\r\ntheir courtship; of his first seeing her, an awkward beautiful\r\nrustic, far too shiftless for the delicate factory work to which she\r\nwas apprenticed; of his first gift to her, a bead necklace, which\r\nhad long ago been put by, in one of the deep drawers of the dresser,\r\nto be kept for Mary.  He wondered if it was there yet, and with a\r\nstrange curiosity he got up to feel for it; for the fire by this\r\ntime was well nigh out, and candle he had none.  His groping hand\r\nfell on the piled-up tea-things, which at his desire she had left\r\nunwashed till morning--they were all so tired.  He was reminded of\r\none of the daily little actions, which acquire such power when they\r\nhave been performed for the last time by one we love.  He began to\r\nthink over his wife\'s daily round of duties: and something in the\r\nremembrance that these would never more be done by her, touched the\r\nsource of tears, and he cried aloud.  Poor Mary, meanwhile, had\r\nmechanically helped the neighbour in all the last attentions to the\r\ndead; and when she was kissed and spoken to soothingly, tears stole\r\nquietly down her cheeks; but she reserved the luxury of a full burst\r\nof grief till she should be alone.  She shut the chamber-door\r\nsoftly, after the neighbour was gone, and then shook the bed by\r\nwhich she knelt with her agony of sorrow.  She repeated, over and\r\nover again, the same words; the same vain, unanswered address to her\r\nwho was no more.  "Oh, mother! mother, are you really dead!  Oh,\r\nmother, mother!"\r\n\r\nAt last she stopped, because it flashed across her mind that her\r\nviolence of grief might disturb her father.  All was still below.\r\nShe looked on the face so changed, and yet so strangely like.  She\r\nbent down to kiss it.  The cold unyielding flesh struck a shudder to\r\nher heart, and hastily obeying her impulse, she grasped the candle,\r\nand opened the door.  Then she heard the sobs of her father\'s grief;\r\nand quickly, quietly stealing down the steps, she knelt by him, and\r\nkissed his hand.  He took no notice at first; for his burst of grief\r\nwould not be controlled.  But when her shriller sobs, her terrified\r\ncries (which she could not repress), rose upon his ear, he checked\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n"Child, we must be all to one another, now SHE is gone," whispered\r\nhe.\r\n\r\n"Oh, father, what can I do for you?  Do tell me!  I\'ll do anything."\r\n\r\n"I know thou wilt.  Thou must not fret thyself ill, that\'s the first\r\nthing I ask.  Thou must leave me and go to bed now, like a good girl\r\nas thou art."\r\n\r\n"Leave you, father! oh, don\'t say so."\r\n\r\n"Ay, but thou must: thou must go to bed, and try and sleep;\r\nthou\'lt have enough to do and to bear, poor wench, tomorrow."\r\n\r\nMary got up, kissed her father, and sadly went upstairs to the\r\nlittle closet, where she slept.  She thought it was of no use\r\nundressing, for that she could never, never sleep, so threw herself\r\non her bed in her clothes, and before ten minutes had passed away,\r\nthe passionate grief of youth had subsided into sleep.\r\n\r\nBarton had been roused by his daughter\'s entrance, both from his\r\nstupor and from his uncontrollable sorrow.  He could think on what\r\nwas to be done, could plan for the funeral, could calculate the\r\nnecessity of soon returning to his work, as the extravagance of the\r\npast night would leave them short of money if he long remained away\r\nfrom the mill.  He was in a club, so that money was provided for the\r\nburial.  These things settled in his own mind, he recalled the\r\ndoctor\'s words, and bitterly thought of the shock his poor wife had\r\nso recently had, in the mysterious disappearance of her cherished\r\nsister.  His feelings towards Esther almost amounted to curses.  It\r\nwas she who had brought on all this sorrow.  Her giddiness, her\r\nlightness of conduct had wrought this woe.  His previous thoughts\r\nabout her had been tinged with wonder and pity, but now he hardened\r\nhis heart against her for ever.\r\n\r\nOne of the good influences over John Barton\'s life had departed that\r\nnight.  One of the ties which bound him down to the gentle\r\nhumanities of earth was loosened, and henceforward the neighbours\r\nall remarked he was a changed man.  His gloom and his sternness\r\nbecame habitual instead of occasional.  He was more obstinate.  But\r\nnever to Mary.  Between the father and the daughter there existed in\r\nfull force that mysterious bond which unites those who have been\r\nloved by one who is now dead and gone.  While he was harsh and\r\nsilent to others, he humoured Mary with tender love: she had more\r\nof her own way than is common in any rank with girls of her age.\r\nPart of this was the necessity of the case; for of course all the\r\nmoney went through her hands, and the household arrangements were\r\nguided by her will and pleasure.  But part was her father\'s\r\nindulgence, for he left her, with full trust in her unusual sense\r\nand spirit, to choose her own associates, and her own times for\r\nseeing them.\r\n\r\nWith all this, Mary had not her father\'s confidence in the matters\r\nwhich now began to occupy him, heart and soul; she was aware that he\r\nhad joined clubs, and become an active member of the Trades\' Union,\r\nbut it was hardly likely that a girl of Mary\'s age (even when two or\r\nthree years had elapsed since her mother\'s death) should care much\r\nfor the differences between the employers and the employed--an\r\neternal subject for agitation in the manufacturing districts, which,\r\nhowever it may be lulled for a time, is sure to break forth again\r\nwith fresh violence at any depression of trade, showing that in its\r\napparent quiet, the ashes had still smouldered in the breasts of a\r\nfew.\r\n\r\nAmong these few was John Barton.  At all times it is a bewildering\r\nthing to the poor weaver to see his employer removing from house to\r\nhouse, each one grander than the last, till he ends in building one\r\nmore magnificent than all, or withdraws his money from the concern,\r\nor sells his mill, to buy an estate in the country, while all the\r\ntime the weaver, who thinks he and his fellows are the real makers\r\nof this wealth, is struggling on for bread for his children, through\r\nthe vicissitudes of lowered wages, short hours, fewer hands\r\nemployed, etc.  And when he knows trade is bad, and could understand\r\n(at least partially) that there are not buyers enough in the market\r\nto purchase the goods already made, and consequently that there is\r\nno demand for more; when he would bear and endure much without\r\ncomplaining, could he also see that his employers were bearing their\r\nshare; he is, I say, bewildered and (to use his own word)\r\n"aggravated" to see that all goes on just as usual with the\r\nmillowners.  Large houses are still occupied, while spinners\' and\r\nweavers\' cottages stand empty, because the families that once filled\r\nthem are obliged to live in rooms or cellars.  Carriages still roll\r\nalong the streets, concerts are still crowded by subscribers, the\r\nshops for expensive luxuries still find daily customers, while the\r\nworkman loiters away his unemployed time in watching these things,\r\nand thinking of the pale, uncomplaining wife at home, and the\r\nwailing children asking in vain for enough of food--of the sinking\r\nhealth, of the dying life of those near and dear to him.  The\r\ncontrast is too great.  Why should he alone suffer from bad times?\r\n\r\nI know that this is not really the case; and I know what is the\r\ntruth in such matters; but what I wish to impress is what the\r\nworkman feels and thinks.  True, that with child-like improvidence,\r\ngood times will often dissipate his grumbling, and make him forget\r\nall prudence and foresight.\r\n\r\nBut there are earnest men among these people, men who have endured\r\nwrongs without complaining, but without ever forgetting or forgiving\r\nthose whom (they believe) have caused all this woe.\r\n\r\nAmong these was John Barton.  His parents had suffered; his mother\r\nhad died from absolute want of the necessaries of life.  He himself\r\nwas a good, steady workman, and, as such, pretty certain of steady\r\nemployment.  But he spent all he got with the confidence (you may\r\nalso call it improvidence) of one who was willing, and believed\r\nhimself able, to supply all his wants by his own exertions.  And\r\nwhen his master suddenly failed, and all hands in the mill were\r\nturned back, one Tuesday morning, with the news that Mr. Hunter had\r\nstopped, Barton had only a few shillings to rely on; but he had good\r\nheart of being employed at some other mill, and accordingly, before\r\nreturning home, he spent some hours in going from factory to\r\nfactory, asking for work.  But at every mill was some sign of\r\ndepression of trade! some were working short hours, some were\r\nturning off hands, and for weeks Barton was out of work, living on\r\ncredit.  It was during this time that his little son, the apple of\r\nhis eye, the cynosure of all his strong power of love, fell ill of\r\nthe scarlet fever.  They dragged him through the crisis, but his\r\nlife hung on a gossamer thread.  Everything, the doctor said,\r\ndepended on good nourishment, on generous living, to keep up the\r\nlittle fellow\'s strength, in the prostration in which the fever had\r\nleft him.  Mocking words! when the commonest food in the house would\r\nnot furnish one little meal.  Barton tried credit; but it was worn\r\nout at the little provision shops, which were now suffering in their\r\nturn.  He thought it would be no sin to steal, and would have\r\nstolen; but he could not get the opportunity in the few days the\r\nchild lingered.  Hungry himself, almost to an animal pitch of\r\nravenousness, but with the bodily pain swallowed up in anxiety for\r\nhis little sinking lad, he stood at one of the shop windows where\r\nall edible luxuries are displayed; haunches of venison, Stilton\r\ncheeses, moulds of jelly--all appetising sights to the common\r\npasser-by.  And out of this shop came Mrs. Hunter!  She crossed to\r\nher carriage, followed by the shopman loaded with purchases for a\r\nparty.  The door was quickly slammed to, and she drove away; and\r\nBarton returned home with a bitter spirit of wrath in his heart to\r\nsee his only boy a corpse!\r\n\r\nYou can fancy, now, the hoards of vengeance in his heart against the\r\nemployers.  For there are never wanting those who, either in speech\r\nor in print, find it their interest to cherish such feelings in the\r\nworking classes; who know how and when to rouse the dangerous power\r\nat their command; and who use their knowledge with unrelenting\r\npurpose to either party.\r\n\r\nSo while Mary took her own way, growing more spirited every day, and\r\ngrowing in her beauty too, her father was chairman at many a Trades\'\r\nUnion meeting; a friend of delegates, and ambitious of being a\r\ndelegate himself; a Chartist, and ready to do anything for his\r\norder.\r\n\r\nBut now times were good; and all these feelings were theoretical,\r\nnot practical.  His most practical thought was getting Mary\r\napprenticed to a dressmaker; for he had never left off disliking a\r\nfactory life for a girl, on more accounts than one.\r\n\r\nMary must do something.  The factories being, as I said, out of the\r\nquestion, there were two things open--going out to service and the\r\ndressmaking business; and against the first of these, Mary set\r\nherself with all the force of her strong will.  What that will might\r\nhave been able to achieve had her father been against her, I cannot\r\ntell; but he disliked the idea of parting with her, who was the\r\nlight of his hearth; the voice of his otherwise silent home.\r\nBesides, with his ideas and feelings towards the higher classes, he\r\nconsidered domestic servitude as a species of slavery; a pampering\r\nof artificial wants on the one side, a giving up of every right of\r\nleisure by day and quiet rest by night on the other.  How far his\r\nstrong exaggerated feelings had any foundation in truth, it is for\r\nyou to judge.  I am afraid that Mary\'s determination not to go to\r\nservice arose from far less sensible thoughts on the subject than\r\nher father\'s.  Three years of independence of action (since her\r\nmother\'s death such a time had now elapsed) had little inclined her\r\nto submit to rules as to hours and associates, to regulate her dress\r\nby a mistress\'s ideas of propriety, to lose the dear feminine\r\nprivileges of gossiping with a merry neighbour, and working night\r\nand day to help one who was sorrowful.  Besides all this, the\r\nsayings of her absent, the mysterious aunt Esther, had an\r\nunacknowledged influence over Mary.  She knew she was very pretty;\r\nthe factory people as they poured from the mills, and in their\r\nfreedom told the truth (whatever it might be) to every passer-by,\r\nhad early let Mary into the secret of her beauty.  If their remarks\r\nhad fallen on an unheeding ear, there were always young men enough,\r\nin a different rank from her own, who were willing to compliment the\r\npretty weaver\'s daughter as they met her in the streets.  Besides,\r\ntrust a girl of sixteen for knowing it well if she is pretty;\r\nconcerning her plainness she may be ignorant.  So with this\r\nconsciousness she had early determined that her beauty should make\r\nher a lady; the rank she coveted the more for her father\'s abuse;\r\nthe rank to which she firmly believed her lost aunt Esther had\r\narrived.  Now, while a servant must often drudge and be dirty, must\r\nbe known as his servant by all who visited at her master\'s house, a\r\ndressmaker\'s apprentice must (or so Mary thought) be always dressed\r\nwith a certain regard to appearances; must never soil her hands, and\r\nneed never redden or dirty her face with hard labour.  Before my\r\ntelling you so truly what folly Mary felt or thought, injures her\r\nwithout redemption in your opinion, think what are the silly fancies\r\nof sixteen years of age in every class, and under all circumstances.\r\nThe end of all the thoughts of father and daughter was, as I said\r\nbefore, Mary was to be a dressmaker; and her ambition prompted her\r\nunwilling father to apply at all the first establishments, to know\r\non what terms of painstaking and zeal his daughter might be admitted\r\ninto ever so humble a workwoman\'s situation.  But high premiums were\r\nasked at all; poor man! he might have known that without giving up a\r\nday\'s work to ascertain the fact.  He would have been indignant,\r\nindeed, had he known that if Mary had accompanied him, the case\r\nmight have been rather different, as her beauty would have made her\r\ndesirable as a show-woman.  Then he tried second-rate places; at all\r\nthe payment of a sum of money was necessary, and money he had none.\r\nDisheartened and angry, he went home at night, declaring it was time\r\nlost; that dressmaking was at all events a troublesome business, and\r\nnot worth learning.  Mary saw that the grapes were sour, and the\r\nnext day she set out herself, as her father could not afford to lose\r\nanother day\'s work; and before night (as yesterday\'s experience had\r\nconsiderably lowered her ideas) she had engaged herself as\r\napprentice (so called, though there were no deeds or indentures to\r\nthe bond) to a certain Miss Simmonds, milliner and dressmaker, in a\r\nrespectable little street leading off Ardwick Green, where her\r\nbusiness was duly announced in gold letters on a black ground,\r\nenclosed in a bird\'s-eye maple frame, and stuck in the front-parlour\r\nwindow; where the workwomen were called "her young ladies"; and\r\nwhere Mary was to work for two years without any remuneration, on\r\nconsideration of being taught the business; and where afterwards she\r\nwas to dine and have tea, with a small quarterly salary (paid\r\nquarterly because so much more genteel than by the week), a VERY\r\nsmall one, divisible into a minute weekly pittance.  In summer she\r\nwas to be there by six, bringing her day\'s meals during the first\r\ntwo years; in winter she was not to come till after breakfast.  Her\r\ntime for returning home at night must always depend upon the\r\nquantity of work Miss Simmonds had to do.\r\n\r\nAnd Mary was satisfied; and seeing this, her father was contented\r\ntoo, although his words were grumbling and morose; but Mary knew his\r\nways, and coaxed and planned for the future so cheerily, that both\r\nwent to bed with easy if not happy hearts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.  OLD ALICE\'S HISTORY.\r\n\r\n     "To envy nought beneath the ample sky;\r\n      To mourn no evil deed, no hour misspent;\r\n      And like a living violet, silently\r\n      Return in sweets to Heaven what goodness lent,\r\n      Then bend beneath the chastening shower content."\r\n                                         --ELLIOTT.\r\n\r\nAnother year passed on.  The waves of time seemed long since to have\r\nswept away all trace of poor Mary Barton.  But her husband still\r\nthought of her, although with a calm and quiet grief, in the silent\r\nwatches of the night: and Mary would start from her hard-earned\r\nsleep, and think, in her half-dreamy, half-awakened state, she saw\r\nher mother stand by her bedside, as she used to do "in the days of\r\nlong ago"; with a shaded candle and an expression of ineffable\r\ntenderness, while she looked on her sleeping child.  But Mary rubbed\r\nher eyes and sank back on her pillow, awake, and knowing it was a\r\ndream; and still, in all her troubles and perplexities, her heart\r\ncalled on her mother for aid, and she thought, "If mother had but\r\nlived, she would have helped me."  Forgetting that the woman\'s\r\nsorrows are far more difficult to mitigate than a child\'s, even by\r\nthe mighty power of a mother\'s love; and unconscious of the fact,\r\nthat she was far superior in sense and spirit to the mother she\r\nmourned.  Aunt Esther was still mysteriously absent, and people had\r\ngrown weary of wondering, and begun to forget.  Barton still\r\nattended his club, and was an active member of a Trades\' Union;\r\nindeed, more frequently than ever, since the time of Mary\'s return\r\nin the evening was so uncertain; and as she occasionally, in very\r\nbusy times, remained all night.  His chiefest friend was still\r\nGeorge Wilson, although he had no great sympathy on the questions\r\nthat agitated Barton\'s mind.  But their hearts were bound by old\r\nties to one another, and the remembrance of former things gave an\r\nunspoken charm to their meetings.  Our old friend, the cub-like lad,\r\nJem Wilson, had shot up into the powerful, well-made young man, with\r\na sensible face enough; nay, a face that might have been handsome,\r\nhad it not been here and there marked by the small-pox.  He worked\r\nwith one of the great firms of engineers, who send from out their\r\ntowns of workshops engines and machinery to the dominions of the\r\nCzar and the Sultan.  His father and mother were never weary of\r\npraising Jem, at all which commendation pretty Mary Barton would\r\ntoss her head, seeing clearly enough that they wished her to\r\nunderstand what a good husband he would make, and to favour his\r\nlove, about which he never dared to speak, whatever eyes and looks\r\nrevealed.\r\n\r\nOne day, in the early winter time, when people were provided with\r\nwarm substantial gowns, not likely soon to wear out, and when,\r\naccordingly, business was rather slack at Miss Simmonds\', Mary met\r\nAlice Wilson, coming home from her half-day\'s work at some\r\ntradesman\'s house.  Mary and Alice had always liked each other;\r\nindeed, Alice looked with particular interest on the motherless\r\ngirl, the daughter of her whose forgiving kiss had comforted her in\r\nmany sleepless hours.  So there was a warm greeting between the tidy\r\nold woman and the blooming young work-girl; and then Alice ventured\r\nto ask if she would come in and take her tea with her that very\r\nevening.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll think it dull enough to come just to sit with an old woman\r\nlike me, but there\'s a tidy young lass as lives in the floor above,\r\nwho does plain work, and now and then a bit in your own line, Mary;\r\nshe\'s grand-daughter to old Job Legh, a spinner, and a good girl she\r\nis.  Do come, Mary!  I\'ve a terrible wish to make you known to each\r\nother.  She\'s a genteel-looking lass, too."\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of this speech Mary had feared the intended visitor\r\nwas to be no other than Alice\'s nephew; but Alice was too\r\ndelicate-minded to plan a meeting, even for her dear Jem, when one\r\nwould have been an unwilling party; and Mary, relieved from her\r\napprehension by the conclusion, gladly agreed to come.  How busy\r\nAlice felt! it was not often she had any one to tea; and now her\r\nsense of the duties of a hostess were almost too much for her.  She\r\nmade haste home, and lighted the unwilling fire, borrowing a pair of\r\nbellows to make it burn the faster.  For herself she was always\r\npatient; she let the coals take their time.  Then she put on her\r\npattens, and went to fill her kettle at the pump in the next court,\r\nand on her way she borrowed a cup; of odd saucers she had plenty,\r\nserving as plates when occasion required.  Half an ounce of tea and\r\na quarter of a pound of butter went far to absorb her morning\'s\r\nwages; but this was an unusual occasion.  In general, she used\r\nherb-tea for herself, when at home, unless some thoughtful mistress\r\nmade a present of tea-leaves from her more abundant household.  The\r\ntwo chairs drawn out for visitors, and duly swept and dusted; an old\r\nboard arranged with some skill upon two old candle boxes set on end\r\n(rather rickety to be sure, but she knew the seat of old, and when\r\nto sit lightly; indeed the whole affair was more for apparent\r\ndignity of position than for any real ease); a little, very little\r\nround table, put just before the fire, which by this time was\r\nblazing merrily; her unlacquered ancient, third-hand tea-tray\r\narranged with a black tea-pot, two cups with a red and white\r\npattern, and one with the old friendly willow pattern, and saucers,\r\nnot to match (on one of the extra supply the lump of butter\r\nflourished away); all these preparations complete, Alice began to\r\nlook about her with satisfaction, and a sort of wonder what more\r\ncould be done to add to the comfort of the evening.  She took one of\r\nthe chairs away from its appropriate place by the table, and putting\r\nit close to the broad large hanging shelf I told you about when I\r\nfirst described her cellar-dwelling, and mounting on it, she pulled\r\ntowards her an old deal box, and took thence a quantity of the oat\r\nbread of the north, the "clap-bread" of Cumberland and Westmoreland,\r\nand descending carefully with the thin cakes, threatening to break\r\nto pieces in her hand, she placed them on the bare table, with the\r\nbelief that her visitors would have an unusual treat in eating the\r\nbread of her childhood.  She brought out a good piece of a\r\nfour-pound loaf of common household bread as well, and then sat down\r\nto rest, really to rest, and not to pretend, on one of the\r\nrush-bottomed chairs.  The candle was ready to be lighted, the\r\nkettle boiled, the tea was awaiting its doom in its paper parcel;\r\nall was ready.\r\n\r\nA knock at the door!  It was Margaret, the young workwoman who lived\r\nin the rooms above, who having heard the bustle, and the subsequent\r\nquiet, began to think it was time to pay her visit below.  She was a\r\nsallow, unhealthy, sweet-looking young woman, with a careworn look;\r\nher dress was humble and very simple, consisting of some kind of\r\ndark stuff gown, her neck being covered by a drab shawl or large\r\nhandkerchief, pinned down behind and at the sides in front.\r\n\r\nThe old woman gave her a hearty greeting, and made her sit down on\r\nthe chair she had just left, while she balanced herself on the board\r\nseat, in order that Margaret might think it was quite her free and\r\nindependent choice to sit there.\r\n\r\n"I cannot think what keeps Mary Barton.  She\'s quite grand with her\r\nlate hours," said Alice, as Mary still delayed.\r\n\r\nThe truth was, Mary was dressing herself; yes, to come to poor old\r\nAlice\'s--she thought it worth while to consider what gown she should\r\nput on.  It was not for Alice, however, you may be pretty sure; no,\r\nthey knew each other too well.  But Mary liked making an impression,\r\nand in this it must be owned she was pretty often gratified--and\r\nthere was this strange girl to consider just now.  So she put on her\r\npretty new blue merino, made tight to her throat her little linen\r\ncollar and linen cuffs, and sallied forth to impress poor gentle\r\nMargaret.  She certainly succeeded.  Alice, who never thought much\r\nabout beauty, had never told Margaret how pretty Mary was; and, as\r\nshe came in half-blushing at her own self-consciousness, Margaret\r\ncould hardly take her eyes off her, and Mary put down her long black\r\nlashes with a sort of dislike of the very observation she had taken\r\nsuch pains to secure.  Can you fancy the bustle of Alice to make the\r\ntea, to pour it out, and sweeten it to their liking, to help and\r\nhelp again to clap-bread and bread and butter?  Can you fancy the\r\ndelight with which she watched her piled-up clap-bread disappear\r\nbefore the hungry girls and listened to the praises of her\r\nhome-remembered dainty?\r\n\r\n"My mother used to send me some clap-bread by any north-country\r\nperson--bless her! She knew how good such things taste when far away\r\nfrom home.  Not but what every one likes it.  When I was in service\r\nmy fellow-servants were always glad to share with me.  Eh, it\'s a\r\nlong time ago, yon."\r\n\r\n"Do tell us about it, Alice," said Margaret.\r\n\r\n"Why, lass, there\'s nothing to tell.  There was more mouths at home\r\nthan could be fed.  Tom, that\'s Will\'s father (you don\'t know Will,\r\nbut he\'s a sailor to foreign parts), had come to Manchester, and\r\nsent word what terrible lots of work was to be had, both for lads\r\nand lasses.  So father sent George first (you know George, well\r\nenough, Mary), and then work was scarce out toward Burton, where we\r\nlived, and father said I maun try and get a place.  And George wrote\r\nas how wages were far higher in Manchester than Milnthorpe or\r\nLancaster; and, lasses, I was young and thoughtless, and thought it\r\nwas a fine thing to go so far from home.  So, one day, th\' butcher\r\nhe brings us a letter fra George, to say he\'d heard on a place--and\r\nI was all agog to go, and father was pleased like; but mother said\r\nlittle, and that little was very quiet.  I\'ve often thought she was\r\na bit hurt to see me so ready to go--God forgive me!  But she packed\r\nup my clothes, and some of the better end of her own as would fit\r\nme, in yon little paper box up there--it\'s good for nought now, but\r\nI would liefer live without fire than break it up to be burnt; and\r\nyet it is going on for eighty years old, for she had it when she was\r\na girl, and brought all her clothes in it to father\'s when they were\r\nmarried.  But, as I was saying, she did not cry, though the tears\r\nwas often in her eyes; and I seen her looking after me down the lane\r\nas long as I were in sight, with her hand shading her eyes--and that\r\nwere the last look I ever had on her."\r\n\r\nAlice knew that before long she should go to that mother; and,\r\nbesides, the griefs and bitter woes of youth have worn themselves\r\nout before we grow old; but she looked so sorrowful that the girls\r\ncaught her sadness, and mourned for the poor woman who had been dead\r\nand gone so many years ago.\r\n\r\n"Did you never see her again, Alice?  Did you never go home while\r\nshe was alive?" asked Mary.\r\n\r\n"No, nor since.  Many a time and oft have I planned to go.  I plan\r\nit yet, and hope to go home again before it please God to take me.\r\nI used to try and save money enough to go for a week when I was in\r\nservice; but first one thing came, and then another.  First,\r\nmissis\'s children fell ill of the measles, just when the week I\'d\r\nasked for came, and I couldn\'t leave them, for one and all cried for\r\nme to nurse them.  Then missis herself fell sick, and I could go\r\nless than ever.  For, you see, they kept a little shop, and he\r\ndrank, and missis and me was all there was to mind children and shop\r\nand all, and cook and wash besides."\r\n\r\nMary was glad she had not gone into service, and said so.\r\n\r\n"Eh, lass! thou little knows the pleasure o\' helping others; I was\r\nas happy there as could be; almost as happy as I was at home.  Well,\r\nbut next year I thought I could go at a leisure time, and missis\r\ntelled me I should have a fortnight then, and I used to sit up all\r\nthat winter working hard at patchwork, to have a quilt of my own\r\nmaking to take to my mother.  But master died, and missis went away\r\nfra Manchester, and I\'d to look out for a place again."\r\n\r\n"Well, but," interrupted Mary, "I should have thought that was the\r\nbest time to go home."\r\n\r\n"No, I thought not.  You see it was a different thing going home for\r\na week on a visit, may be with money in my pocket to give father a\r\nlift, to going home to be a burden to him.  Besides, how could I\r\nhear o\' a place there?  Anyways I thought it best to stay, though\r\nperhaps it might have been better to ha\' gone, for then I should ha\'\r\nseen mother again"; and the poor old woman looked puzzled.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure you did what you thought right," said Margaret gently.\r\n\r\n"Ay, lass, that\'s it," said Alice, raising her head and speaking\r\nmore cheerfully.  "That\'s the thing, and then let the Lord send what\r\nHe sees fit; not but that I grieved sore, oh, sore and sad, when\r\ntowards spring next year, when my quilt were all done to th\' lining,\r\nGeorge came in one evening to tell me mother was dead.  I cried many\r\na night at after;* I\'d no time for crying by day, for that missis\r\nwas terrible strict; she would not hearken to my going to th\'\r\nfuneral; and indeed I would have been too late, for George set off\r\nthat very night by th\' coach, and the letter had been kept or summut\r\n(posts were not like th\' posts now-a-days), and he found the burial\r\nall over, and father talking o\' flitting; for he couldn\'t abide the\r\ncottage after mother was gone."\r\n\r\n     *"Come to me, Tyrrel, soon, AT AFTER supper."\r\n                                --SHAKSPEARE, Richard III.\r\n\r\n"Was it a pretty place?" asked Mary.\r\n\r\n"Pretty, lass!  I never seed such a bonny bit anywhere.  You see\r\nthere are hills there as seem to go up into th\' skies, not near\r\nmaybe, but that makes them all the bonnier.  I used to think they\r\nwere the golden hills of heaven, about which mother sang when I was\r\na child--\r\n\r\n    "\'Yon are the golden hills o\' heaven,\r\n      Where ye sall never win.\'\r\n\r\n"Something about a ship and a lover that should hae been na lover,\r\nthe ballad was.  Well, and near our cottage were rocks.  Eh, lasses!\r\nye don\'t know what rocks are in Manchester!  Grey pieces o\' stone as\r\nlarge as a house, all covered over wi\' mosses of different colours,\r\nsome yellow, some brown; and the ground beneath them knee-deep in\r\npurple heather, smelling sae sweet and fragrant, and the low music\r\nof the humming-bee for ever sounding among it.  Mother used to send\r\nSally and me out to gather ling and heather for besoms, and it was\r\nsuch pleasant work!  We used to come home of an evening loaded so as\r\nyou could not see us, for all that it was so light to carry.  And\r\nthen mother would make us sit down under the old hawthorn tree\r\n(where we used to make our house among the great roots as stood\r\nabove th\' ground), to pick and tie up the heather.  It seems all\r\nlike yesterday, and yet it\'s a long long time agone.  Poor sister\r\nSally has been in her grave this forty year and more.  But I often\r\nwonder if the hawthorn is standing yet, and if the lasses still go\r\nto gather heather, as we did many and many a year past and gone.  I\r\nsicken at heart to see the old spot once again.  May be next summer\r\nI may set off, if God spares me to see next summer."\r\n\r\n"Why have you never been in all these many years?" asked Mary.\r\n\r\n"Why, lass! first one wanted me and then another; and I couldn\'t go\r\nwithout money either, and I got very poor at times.  Tom was a\r\nscapegrace, poor fellow, and always wanted help of one kind or\r\nanother; and his wife (for I think scapegraces are always married\r\nlong before steady folk) was but a helpless kind of body.  She were\r\nalways ailing, and he were always in trouble; so I had enough to do\r\nwith my hands, and my money too, for that matter.  They died within\r\ntwelvemonth of each other, leaving one lad (they had had seven, but\r\nthe Lord had taken six to Hisself), Will, as I was telling you on;\r\nand I took him myself, and left service to make a bit of a\r\nhome-place for him, and a fine lad he was, the very spit of his\r\nfather as to looks, only steadier.  For he was steady, although\r\nnought would serve him but going to sea.  I tried all I could to set\r\nhim again a sailor\'s life.  Says I, \'Folks is as sick as dogs all\r\nthe time they\'re at sea.  Your own mother telled me (for she came\r\nfrom foreign parts, being a Manx woman) that she\'d ha\' thanked any\r\none for throwing her into the water.\'  Nay, I sent him a\' the way to\r\nRuncorn by th\' Duke\'s canal, that he might know what th\' sea were;\r\nand I looked to see him come back as white as a sheet wi\' vomiting.\r\nBut the lad went on to Liverpool and saw real ships, and came back\r\nmore set than ever on being a sailor, and he said as how he had\r\nnever been sick at all, and thought he could stand the sea pretty\r\nwell.  So I told him he mun do as he liked; and he thanked me and\r\nkissed me, for all I was very frabbit* with him; and now he\'s gone\r\nto South America at t\'other side of the sun, they tell me."\r\n\r\n     *Frabbit; peevish.\r\n\r\nMary stole a glance at Margaret to see what she thought of Alice\'s\r\ngeography; but Margaret looked so quiet and demure, that Mary was in\r\ndoubt if she were not really ignorant.  Not that Mary\'s knowledge\r\nwas very profound, but she had seen a terrestrial globe, and knew\r\nwhere to find France and the continents on a map.\r\n\r\nAfter this long talking Alice seemed lost for a time in reverie; and\r\nthe girls respecting her thoughts, which they suspected had wandered\r\nto the home and scenes of her childhood, were silent.  All at once\r\nshe recalled her duties as hostess, and by an effort brought back\r\nher mind to the present time.\r\n\r\n"Margaret, thou must let Mary hear thee sing.  I don\'t know about\r\nfine music myself, but folks say Marget is a rare singer, and I know\r\nshe can make me cry at any time by singing \'Th\' Owdham Weaver.\'  Do\r\nsing that, Marget, there\'s a good lass."\r\n\r\nWith a faint smile, as if amused at Alice\'s choice of a song,\r\nMargaret began.\r\n\r\nDo you know "The Oldham Weaver?"  Not unless you are Lancashire born\r\nand bred, for it is a complete Lancashire ditty.  I will copy it for\r\nyou.\r\n\r\n                    THE OLDHAM WEAVER.\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nOi\'m a poor cotton-weyver, as mony a one knoowas,\r\nOi\'ve nowt for t\' yeat, an\' oi\'ve worn eawt my clooas,\r\nYo\'ad hardly gi\' tuppence for aw as oi\'ve on,\r\nMy clogs are both brosten, an\' stuckings oi\'ve none,\r\n     Yo\'d think it wur hard,\r\n     To be browt into th\' warld,\r\nTo be--clemmed,* an\' do th\' best as yo con.\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nOwd Dicky o\' Billy\'s kept telling me long,\r\nWee s\'d ha\' better toimes if I\'d but howd my tung,\r\nOi\'ve howden my tung, till oi\'ve near stopped my breath,\r\nOi think i\' my heeart oi\'se soon clem to deeath,\r\n     Owd Dicky\'s weel crammed,\r\n     He never wur clemmed,\r\nAn\' he ne\'er picked ower i\' his loife,**\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nWe tow\'rt on six week--thinking aitch day wur th\' last,\r\nWe shifted, an\' shifted, till neaw we\'re quoite fast;\r\nWe lived upo\' nettles, whoile nettles wur good,\r\nAn\' Waterloo porridge the best o\' eawr food,\r\n     Oi\'m tellin\' yo\' true,\r\n     Oi can find folk enow,\r\nAs wur livin\' na better nor me.\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nOwd Billy o\' Dans sent th\' baileys one day,\r\nFur a shop deebt oi eawd him, as oi could na pay,\r\nBut he wur too lat, fur owd Billy o\' th\' Bent,\r\nHad sowd th\' tit an\' cart, an\' ta\'en goods for th\' rent,\r\n     We\'d neawt left bo\' th\' owd stoo\',\r\n     That wur seeats fur two,\r\nAn\' on it ceawred Marget an\' me.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen t\' baileys leuked reawnd as sloy as a meawse,\r\nWhen they seed as aw t\' goods were ta\'en eawt o\' t\' heawse;\r\nSays one chap to th\' tother, "Aws gone, theaw may see";\r\nSays oi, "Ne\'er freet, mon, yeaur welcome ta\' me."\r\n     They made no moor ado\r\n     But whopped up th\' eawd stoo\',\r\nAn\' we booath leet, whack--upo\' t\' flags\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\nThen oi said to eawr Marget, as we lay upo\' t\' floor,\r\n"We\'s never be lower i\' this warld oi\'m sure,\r\nIf ever things awtern, oi\'m sure they mun mend,\r\nFor oi think i\' my heart we\'re booath at t\' far eend;\r\n     For meeat we ha\' none,\r\n     Nor looms t\' weyve on,--\r\nEdad! they\'re as good lost as fund."\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\nEawr Marget declares had hoo clooas to put on,\r\nHoo\'d goo up to Lunnon an\' talk to th\' greet mon\r\nAn\' if things were na awtered when there hoo had been,\r\nHoo\'s fully resolved t\' sew up meawth an\' eend;\r\n     Hoo\'s neawt to say again t\' king,\r\n     But hoo loikes a fair thing,\r\nAn\' hoo says hoo can tell when hoo\'s hurt.\r\n\r\n     *Clem; to starve with hunger.\r\n          "Hard is the choice, when the valiant\r\n           must eat their arms or CLEM."--BEN JONSON.\r\n    **To "pick ower," means to throw the shuttle in hand-loom weaving.\r\n\r\nThe air to which this is sung is a kind of droning recitative,\r\ndepending much on expression and feeling.  To read it, it may,\r\nperhaps, seem humorous; but it is that humour which is near akin to\r\npathos, and to those who have seen the distress it describes it is a\r\npowerfully pathetic song.  Margaret had both witnessed the\r\ndestitution, and had the heart to feel it, and withal, her voice was\r\nof that rich and rare order, which does not require any great\r\ncompass of notes to make itself appreciated.  Alice had her quiet\r\nenjoyment of tears.  But Margaret, with fixed eye, and earnest,\r\ndreamy look, seemed to become more and more absorbed in realising to\r\nherself the woe she had been describing, and which she felt might at\r\nthat very moment be suffering and hopeless within a short distance\r\nof their comparative comfort.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she burst forth with all the power of her magnificent\r\nvoice, as if a prayer from her very heart for all who were in\r\ndistress, in the grand supplication, "Lord, remember David."  Mary\r\nheld her breath, unwilling to lose a note, it was so clear, so\r\nperfect, so imploring.  A far more correct musician than Mary might\r\nhave paused with equal admiration of the really scientific knowledge\r\nwith which the poor depressed-looking young needlewoman used her\r\nsuperb and flexile voice.  Deborah Travis herself (once an Oldham\r\nfactory girl, and afterwards the darling of fashionable crowds as\r\nMrs. Knyvett) might have owned a sister in her art.\r\n\r\nShe stopped; and with tears of holy sympathy in her eyes, Alice\r\nthanked the songstress, who resumed her calm, demure manner, much to\r\nMary\'s wonder, for she looked at her unweariedly, as if surprised\r\nthat the hidden power should not be perceived in the outward\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nWhen Alice\'s little speech of thanks was over, there was quiet\r\nenough to hear a fine, though rather quavering, male voice, going\r\nover again one or two strains of Margaret\'s song.\r\n\r\n"That\'s grandfather!" exclaimed she.  "I must be going, for he said\r\nhe should not be at home till past nine."\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'ll not say nay, for I have to be up by four for a very\r\nheavy wash at Mrs. Simpson\'s; but I shall be terrible glad to see\r\nyou again at any time, lasses; and I hope you\'ll take to one\r\nanother."\r\n\r\nAs the girls ran up the cellar steps together, Margaret said--"Just\r\nstep in and see grandfather, I should like him to see you."\r\n\r\nAnd Mary consented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.   THE MILL ON FIRE-JEM WILSON TO THE RESCUE.\r\n\r\n     "Learned he was; nor bird nor insect flew,\r\n      But he its leafy home and history knew:\r\n      Nor wild-flower decked the rock, nor moss the well,\r\n      But he its name and qualities could tell."\r\n                                          --ELLIOTT.\r\n\r\nThere is a class of men in Manchester, unknown even to many of the\r\ninhabitants, and whose existence will probably be doubted by many,\r\nwho yet may claim kindred with all the noble names that science\r\nrecognises.  I said in "Manchester," but they are scattered all over\r\nthe manufacturing districts of Lancashire.  In the neighbourhood of\r\nOldham there are weavers, common hand-loom weavers, who throw the\r\nshuttle with unceasing sound, though Newton\'s "Principia" lies open\r\non the loom, to be snatched at in work hours, but revelled over in\r\nmeal times, or at night.  Mathematical problems are received with\r\ninterest, and studied with absorbing attention by many a broad-\r\nspoken, common-looking factory-hand.  It is perhaps less astonishing\r\nthat the more popularly interesting branches of natural history have\r\ntheir warm and devoted followers among this class.  There are\r\nbotanists among them, equally familiar with either the Linnaean or\r\nthe Natural system, who know the name and habitat of every plant\r\nwithin a day\'s walk from their dwellings; who steal the holiday of a\r\nday or two when any particular plant should be in flower, and tying\r\nup their simple food in their pocket-handkerchiefs, set off with\r\nsingle purpose to fetch home the humble-looking weed.  There are\r\nentomologists, who may be seen with a rude-looking net, ready to\r\ncatch any winged insect, or a kind of dredge, with which they rake\r\nthe green and slimy pools; practical, shrewd, hard-working men, who\r\npore over every new specimen with real scientific delight.  Nor is\r\nit the common and more obvious divisions of Entomology and Botany\r\nthat alone attract these earnest seekers after knowledge.  Perhaps\r\nit may be owing to the great annual town-holiday of Whitsun-week so\r\noften falling in May or June, that the two great beautiful families\r\nof Ephemeridae and Phryganidae have been so much and so closely\r\nstudied by Manchester workmen, while they have in a great measure\r\nescaped general observation.  If you will refer to the preface to\r\nSir J. E. Smith\'s Life (I have it not by me, or I would copy you the\r\nexact passage), you will find that he names a little circumstance\r\ncorroborative of what I have said.  Being on a visit to Roscoe, of\r\nLiverpool, he made some inquiries of him as to the habitat of a very\r\nrare plant, said to be found in certain places in Lancashire.  Mr.\r\nRoscoe knew nothing of the plant; but stated, that if any one could\r\ngive him the desired information, it would be a hand-loom weaver in\r\nManchester, whom he named.  Sir J. E. Smith proceeded by boat to\r\nManchester, and on arriving at that town, he inquired of the porter\r\nwho was carrying his luggage if he could direct him to So-and-So.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes," replied the man.  "He does a bit in my way"; and, on\r\nfurther investigation, it turned out that both the porter and his\r\nfriend the weaver were skilful botanists, and able to give Sir J. E.\r\nSmith the very information which he wanted.\r\n\r\nSuch are the tastes and pursuits of some of the thoughtful, little\r\nunderstood, working-men of Manchester.\r\n\r\nAnd Margaret\'s grandfather was one of these.  He was a little\r\nwiry-looking old man, who moved with a jerking motion, as if his\r\nlimbs were worked by a string like a child\'s toy, with dun-coloured\r\nhair lying thin and soft at the back and sides of his head; his\r\nforehead was so large it seemed to overbalance the rest of his face,\r\nwhich had, indeed, lost its natural contour by the absence of all\r\nthe teeth.  The eyes absolutely gleamed with intelligence; so keen,\r\nso observant, you felt as if they were almost wizard-like.  Indeed,\r\nthe whole room looked not unlike a wizard\'s dwelling.  Instead of\r\npictures were hung rude wooden frames of impaled insects; the little\r\ntable was covered with cabalistic books; and beside them lay a case\r\nof mysterious instruments, one of which Job Legh was using when his\r\ngrand-daughter entered.\r\n\r\nOn her appearance he pushed his spectacles up so as to rest midway\r\non his forehead, and gave Mary a short, kind welcome.  But Margaret\r\nhe caressed as a mother caresses her first-born; stroking her with\r\ntenderness, and almost altering his voice as he spoke to her.\r\n\r\nMary looked round on the odd, strange things she had never seen at\r\nhome, and which seemed to her to have a very uncanny look.\r\n\r\n"Is your grandfather a fortune-teller?" whispered she to her new\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\n"No," replied Margaret, in the same voice; "but you are not the\r\nfirst as has taken him for such.  He is only fond of such things as\r\nmost folks know nothing about."\r\n\r\n"And do you know aught about them too?"\r\n\r\n"I know a bit about some of the things grandfather is fond on; just\r\nbecause he\'s fond on \'em, I tried to learn about them."\r\n\r\n"What things are these?" said Mary, struck with the weird-looking\r\ncreatures that sprawled around the room in their roughly-made glass\r\ncases.\r\n\r\nBut she was not prepared for the technical names, which Job Legh\r\npattered down on her ear, on which they fell like hail on a\r\nskylight; and the strange language only bewildered her more than\r\never.  Margaret saw the state of the case, and came to the rescue.\r\n\r\n"Look, Mary, at this horrid scorpion.  He gave me such a fright: I\r\nam all of a twitter yet when I think of it.  Grandfather went to\r\nLiverpool one Whitsun-week to go strolling about the docks and pick\r\nup what he could from the sailors, who often bring some queer thing\r\nor another from the hot countries they go to; and so he sees a chap\r\nwith a bottle in his hand, like a druggist\'s physic-bottle; and says\r\ngrandfather, \'What have ye gotten there?\'  So the sailor holds it\r\nup, and grandfather knew it was a rare kind o\' scorpion, not common\r\neven in the East Indies where the man came from; and says he, \'How\r\ndid you catch this fine fellow, for he wouldn\'t be taken for\r\nnothing, I\'m thinking?\'  And the man said as how when they were\r\nunloading the ship he\'d found him lying behind a bag of rice, and he\r\nthought the cold had killed him, for he was not squashed nor injured\r\na bit.  He did not like to part with any of the spirit out of his\r\ngrog to put the scorpion in, but slipped him into the bottle,\r\nknowing there were folks enow who would give him something for him.\r\nSo grandfather gives him a shilling."\r\n\r\n"Two shillings," interrupted Job Legh; "and a good bargain it was."\r\n\r\n"Well! grandfather came home as proud as Punch, and pulled the\r\nbottle out of his pocket.  But you see th\' scorpion were doubled up,\r\nand grandfather thought I couldn\'t fairly see how big he was.  So he\r\nshakes him out right before the fire; and a good warm one it was,\r\nfor I was ironing, I remember.  I left off ironing and stooped down\r\nover him, to look at him better, and grandfather got a book, and\r\nbegan to read how this very kind were the most poisonous and vicious\r\nspecies, how their bite were often fatal, and then went on to read\r\nhow people who were bitten got swelled, and screamed with pain.  I\r\nwas listening hard, but as it fell out, I never took my eyes off the\r\ncreature, though I could not ha\' told I was watching it.  Suddenly\r\nit seemed to give a jerk, and before I could speak it gave another,\r\nand in a minute it was as wild as it could be, running at me just\r\nlike a mad dog."\r\n\r\n"What did you do?" asked Mary.\r\n\r\n"Me! why, I jumped first on a chair, and then on all the things I\'d\r\nbeen ironing on the dresser, and I screamed for grandfather to come\r\nup by me, but he did not hearken to me."\r\n\r\n"Why, if I\'d come up by thee, who\'d ha\' caught the creature, I\r\nshould like to know?"\r\n\r\n"Well, I begged grandfather to crush it, and I had the iron right\r\nover it once, ready to drop, but grandfather begged me not to hurt\r\nit in that way.  So I couldn\'t think what he\'d have, for he hopped\r\nround the room as if he were sore afraid, for all he begged me not\r\nto injure it.  At last he goes to th\' kettle, and lifts up the lid,\r\nand peeps in.  What on earth is he doing that for, thinks I; he\'ll\r\nnever drink his tea with a scorpion running free and easy about the\r\nroom.  Then he takes the tongs, and he settles his spectacles on his\r\nnose, and in a minute he had lifted the creature up by th\' leg, and\r\ndropped him into the boiling water."\r\n\r\n"And did that kill him?" said Mary.\r\n\r\n"Ay, sure enough; he boiled for longer time than grandfather liked,\r\nthough.  But I was so afeard of his coming round again, I ran to the\r\npublic-house for some gin, and grandfather filled the bottle, and\r\nthen we poured off the water, and picked him out of the kettle, and\r\ndropped him into the bottle, and he were there about a twelvemonth."\r\n\r\n"What brought him to life at first?" asked Mary.\r\n\r\n"Why, you see, he were never really dead, only torpid--that is, dead\r\nasleep with the cold, and our good fire brought him round."\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad father does not care for such things," said Mary.\r\n\r\n"Are you?  Well, I\'m often downright glad grandfather is so fond of\r\nhis books, and his creatures, and his plants.  It does my heart good\r\nto see him so happy, sorting them all at home, and so ready to go in\r\nsearch of more, whenever he\'s a spare day.  Look at him now! he\'s\r\ngone back to his books, and he\'ll be as happy as a king, working\r\naway till I make him go to bed.  It keeps him silent, to be sure;\r\nbut so long as I see him earnest, and pleased, and eager, what does\r\nthat matter?  Then, when he has his talking bouts, you can\'t think\r\nhow much he has to say.  Dear grandfather! you don\'t know how happy\r\nwe are!"\r\n\r\nMary wondered if the dear grandfather heard all this, for Margaret\r\ndid not speak in an undertone; but no! he was far too deep, and\r\neager in solving a problem.  He did not even notice Mary\'s\r\nleave-taking, and she went home with the feeling that she had that\r\nnight made the acquaintance of two of the strangest people she ever\r\nsaw in her life.  Margaret, so quiet, so commonplace, until her\r\nsinging powers were called forth; so silent from home, so cheerful\r\nand agreeable at home; and her grandfather so very different to any\r\none Mary had ever seen.  Margaret had said he was not a\r\nfortune-teller, but she did not know whether to believe her.\r\n\r\nTo resolve her doubts, she told the history of the evening to her\r\nfather, who was interested by her account, and curious to see and\r\njudge for himself.  Opportunities are not often wanting where\r\ninclination goes before, and ere the end of that winter Mary looked\r\nupon Margaret almost as an old friend.  The latter would bring her\r\nwork when Mary was likely to be at home in the evenings and sit with\r\nher; and Job Legh would put a book and his pipe in his pocket and\r\njust step round the corner to fetch his grandchild, ready for a talk\r\nif he found Barton in; ready to pull out pipe and book if the girls\r\nwanted him to wait, and John was still at his club.  In short, ready\r\nto do whatever would give pleasure to his darling Margaret.\r\n\r\nI do not know what points of resemblance, or dissimilitude (for this\r\njoins people as often as that) attracted the two girls to each\r\nother.  Margaret had the great charm of possessing good strong\r\ncommon sense, and do you not perceive how involuntarily this is\r\nvalued?  It is so pleasant to have a friend who possesses the power\r\nof setting a difficult question in a clear light; whose judgment can\r\ntell what is best to be done; and who is so convinced of what is\r\n"wisest, best," that in consideration of the end, all difficulties\r\nin the way diminish.  People admire talent, and talk about their\r\nadmiration.  But they value common sense without talking about it,\r\nand often without knowing it.\r\n\r\nSo Mary and Margaret grew in love one toward the other; and Mary\r\ntold many of her feelings in a way she had never done before to any\r\none.  Most of her foibles also were made known to Margaret, but not\r\nall.  There was one cherished weakness still concealed from every\r\none.  It concerned a lover, not beloved, but favoured by fancy.  A\r\ngallant, handsome young man; but--not beloved.  Yet Mary hoped to\r\nmeet him every day in her walks, blushed when she heard his name,\r\nand tried to think of him as her future husband, and above all,\r\ntried to think of herself as his future wife.  Alas! poor Mary!\r\nBitter woe did thy weakness work thee.\r\n\r\nShe had other lovers.  One or two would gladly have kept her\r\ncompany, but she held herself too high, they said.  Jem Wilson said\r\nnothing, but loved on and on, ever more fondly; he hoped against\r\nhope; he would not give up, for it seemed like giving up life to\r\ngive up thought of Mary.  He did not dare to look to any end of all\r\nthis; the present, so that he saw her, touched the hem of her\r\ngarment, was enough.  Surely, in time, such deep hope would beget\r\nlove.\r\n\r\nHe would not relinquish hope, and yet her coldness of manner was\r\nenough to daunt any man; and it made Jem more despairing than he\r\nwould acknowledge for a long time even to himself.\r\n\r\nBut one evening he came round by Barton\'s house, a willing messenger\r\nfor his father, and opening the door saw Margaret sitting asleep\r\nbefore the fire.  She had come in to speak to Mary; and worn-out by\r\na long, working, watching night, she fell asleep in the genial\r\nwarmth.\r\n\r\nAn old-fashioned saying about a pair of gloves came into Jem\'s mind,\r\nand stepping gently up, he kissed Margaret with a friendly kiss.\r\n\r\nShe awoke, and perfectly understanding the thing, she said, "For\r\nshame of yourself, Jem!  What would Mary say?"\r\n\r\nLightly said, lightly answered.\r\n\r\n"She\'d nobbut say, practice makes perfect."  And they both laughed.\r\nBut the words Margaret had said rankled in Jem\'s mind.  Would Mary\r\ncare?  Would she care in the very least?  They seemed to call for an\r\nanswer by night and by day; and Jem felt that his heart told him\r\nMary was quite indifferent to any action of his.  Still he loved on,\r\nand on, ever more fondly.\r\n\r\nMary\'s father was well aware of the nature of Jem Wilson\'s feelings\r\nfor his daughter, but he took no notice of them to any one, thinking\r\nMary full young yet for the cares of married life, and unwilling,\r\ntoo, to entertain the idea of parting with her at any time, however\r\ndistant.  But he welcomed Jem at his house, as he would have done\r\nhis father\'s son, whatever were his motives for coming; and now and\r\nthen admitted the thought, that Mary might do worse, when her time\r\ncame, than marry Jem Wilson, a steady workman at a good trade, a\r\ngood son to his parents, and a fine manly spirited chap--at least\r\nwhen Mary was not by; for when she was present he watched her too\r\nclosely, and too anxiously, to have much of what John Barton called\r\n"spunk" in him.\r\n\r\nIt was towards the end of February, in that year, and a bitter black\r\nfrost had lasted for many weeks.  The keen east wind had long since\r\nswept the streets clean, though in a gusty day the dust would rise\r\nlike pounded ice, and make people\'s faces quite smart with the cold\r\nforce with which it blew against them.  Houses, sky, people, and\r\neverything looked as if a gigantic brush had washed them all over\r\nwith a dark shade of Indian ink.  There was some reason for this\r\ngrimy appearance on human beings, whatever there might be for the\r\ndun looks of the landscape; for soft water had become an article not\r\neven to be purchased; and the poor washerwomen might be seen vainly\r\ntrying to procure a little by breaking the thick grey ice that\r\ncoated the ditches and ponds in the neighbourhood.  People\r\nprophesied a long continuance to this already lengthened frost; said\r\nthe spring would be very late; no spring fashions required; no\r\nsummer clothing chased for a short uncertain summer.  Indeed, there\r\nwas no end to the evil prophesied during the continuance of that\r\nbleak east wind.\r\n\r\nMary hurried home one evening, just as daylight was fading, from\r\nMiss Simmonds\', with her shawl held up to her mouth, and her head\r\nbent as if in deprecation of the meeting wind.  So she did not\r\nperceive Margaret till she was close upon her at the very turning\r\ninto the court.\r\n\r\n"Bless me, Margaret! is that you?  Where are you bound to?"\r\n\r\n"To nowhere but your own house (that is, if you\'ll take me in).\r\nI\'ve a job of work to finish to-night; mourning, as must be in time\r\nfor the funeral to-morrow; and grandfather has been out moss-\r\nhunting, and will not be home till late."\r\n\r\n"Oh, how charming it will be!  I\'ll help you if you\'re backward.\r\nHave you much to do?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I only got the order yesterday at noon; and there\'s three\r\ngirls beside the mother; and what with trying on and matching the\r\nstuff (for there was not enough in the piece they chose first), I\'m\r\nabove a bit behindhand.  I\'ve the skirts all to make.  I kept that\r\nwork till candlelight; and the sleeves, to say nothing of little\r\nbits to the bodies; for the missis is very particular, and I could\r\nscarce keep from smiling while they were crying so, really taking on\r\nsadly I\'m sure, to hear first one and then t\'other clear up to\r\nnotice the set of her gown.  They weren\'t to be misfits, I promise\r\nyou, though they were in such trouble."\r\n\r\n"Well, Margaret, you\'re right welcome, as you know, and I\'ll sit\r\ndown and help you with pleasure, though I was tired enough of sewing\r\nto-night at Miss Simmonds\'!"\r\n\r\nBy this time Mary had broken up the raking coal, and lighted her\r\ncandle; and Margaret settled herself to her work on one side of the\r\ntable, while her friend hurried over her tea at the other.  The\r\nthings were then lifted en masse to the dresser; and dusting her\r\nside of the table with the apron she always wore at home, Mary took\r\nup some breadths and began to run them together.\r\n\r\n"Who\'s it all for, for if you told me I\'ve forgotten?"\r\n\r\n"Why, for Mrs. Ogden as keeps the greengrocer\'s shop in Oxford Road.\r\nHer husband drank himself to death, and though she cried over him\r\nand his ways all the time he was alive, she\'s fretted sadly for him\r\nnow he\'s dead."\r\n\r\n"Has he left her much to go upon?" asked Mary, examining the texture\r\nof the dress.  "This is beautifully fine soft bombazine."\r\n\r\n"No, I\'m much afeard there\'s but little, and there\'s several young\r\nchildren, besides the three Miss Ogdens."\r\n\r\n"I should have thought girls like them would ha\' made their own\r\ngowns," observed Mary.\r\n\r\n"So I dare say they do, many a one, but now they seem all so busy\r\ngetting ready for the funeral; for it\'s to be quite a grand affair,\r\nwell-nigh twenty people to breakfast, as one of the little ones told\r\nme.  The little thing seemed to like the fuss, and I do believe it\r\ncomforted poor Mrs. Ogden to make all the piece o\' work.  Such a\r\nsmell of ham boiling and fowls roasting while I waited in the\r\nkitchen; it seemed more like a wedding nor* a funeral.  They said\r\nshe\'d spend a matter o\' sixty pound on th\' burial."\r\n\r\n     *Nor; generally used in Lancashire for "than."\r\n      "They had lever sleep NOR be in laundery."--DUNBAR\r\n\r\n"I thought you said she was but badly off," said Mary.\r\n\r\n"Ay, I know she\'s asked for credit at several places, saying her\r\nhusband laid hands on every farthing he could get for drink.  But\r\nth\' undertakers urge her on, you see, and tell her this thing\'s\r\nusual, and that thing\'s only a common mark of respect, and that\r\neverybody has t\'other thing, till the poor woman has no will o\' her\r\nown.  I dare say, too, her heart strikes her (it always does when a\r\nperson\'s gone) for many a word and many a slighting deed to him\r\nwho\'s stiff and cold; and she thinks to make up matters, as it were,\r\nby a grand funeral, though she and all her children, too, may have\r\nto pinch many a year to pay the expenses, if ever they pay them at\r\nall."\r\n\r\n"This mourning, too, will cost a pretty penny," said Mary.  "I often\r\nwonder why folks wear mourning; it\'s not pretty or becoming; and it\r\ncosts a deal of money just when people can spare it least; and if\r\nwhat the Bible tells us be true, we ought not to be sorry when a\r\nfriend, who\'s been good, goes to his rest; and as for a bad man,\r\none\'s glad enough to get shut* on him.  I cannot see what good comes\r\nout o\' wearing mourning."\r\n\r\n     *Shut; quit.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell you what I think the fancy was sent for (old Alice calls\r\neverything \'sent for,\' and I believe she\'s right).  It does do good,\r\nthough not as much as it costs, that I do believe, in setting people\r\n(as is cast down by sorrow and feels themselves unable to settle to\r\nanything but crying) something to do.  Why now I told you how they\r\nwere grieving; for, perhaps, he was a kind husband and father, in\r\nhis thoughtless way, when he wasn\'t in liquor.  But they cheered up\r\nwonderful while I was there, and I asked \'em for more directions\r\nthan usual, that they might have something to talk over and fix\r\nabout; and I left \'em my fashion-book (though it were two months\r\nold) just a purpose."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think every one would grieve a that way.  Old Alice\r\nwouldn\'t."\r\n\r\n"Old Alice is one in a thousand.  I doubt, too, if she would fret\r\nmuch, however sorry she might be.  She would say it were sent, and\r\nfall to trying to find out what good it were to do.  Every sorrow in\r\nher mind is sent for good.  Did I ever tell you, Mary, what she said\r\none day when she found me taking on about something?"\r\n\r\n"No; do tell me.  What were you fretting about, first place?"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t tell you, just now; perhaps I may some time."\r\n\r\n"When?"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps this very evening, if it rises in my heart; perhaps never.\r\nIt\'s a fear that sometimes I can\'t abide to think about, and\r\nsometimes I don\'t like to think on anything else.  Well, I was\r\nfretting about this fear, and Alice comes in for something, and\r\nfinds me crying.  I would not tell her no more than I would you,\r\nMary; so she says, \'Well, dear, you must mind this, when you\'re\r\ngoing to fret and be low about anything--An anxious mind is never a\r\nholy mind.\'  O Mary, I have so often checked my grumbling sin\'* she\r\nsaid that."\r\n\r\n     *Sin\'; since.\r\n             "SIN that his lord was twenty yere of age."\r\n                        --Prologue to Canterbury Tales.\r\n\r\nThe weary sound of stitching was the only sound heard for a little\r\nwhile, till Mary inquired--\r\n\r\n"Do you expect to get paid for this mourning?"\r\n\r\n"Why, I do not much think I shall.  I\'ve thought it over once or\r\ntwice, and I mean to bring myself to think I shan\'t, and to like to\r\ndo it as my bit towards comforting them.  I don\'t think they can\r\npay, and yet they\'re just the sort of folk to have their minds\r\neasier for wearing mourning.  There\'s only one thing I dislike\r\nmaking black for, it does so hurt the eyes."\r\n\r\nMargaret put down her work with a sigh, and shaded her eyes.  Then\r\nshe assumed a cheerful tone, and said--\r\n\r\n"You\'ll not have to wait long, Mary, for my secret\'s on the tip of\r\nmy tongue.  Mary, do you know I sometimes think I\'m growing a little\r\nblind, and then what would become of grandfather and me?  Oh, God\r\nhelp me, Lord help me!"\r\n\r\nShe fell into an agony of tears, while Mary knelt by her, striving\r\nto soothe and to comfort her: but, like an inexperienced person,\r\nstriving rather to deny the correctness of Margaret\'s fear, than\r\nhelping her to meet and overcome the evil.\r\n\r\n"No," said Margaret, quietly fixing her tearful eyes on Mary; "I\r\nknow I\'m not mistaken.  I have felt one going some time, long before\r\nI ever thought what it would lead to; and last autumn I went to a\r\ndoctor; and he did not mince the matter, but said unless I sat in a\r\ndarkened room, with my hands before me, my sight would not last me\r\nmany years longer.  But how could I do that, Mary?  For one thing,\r\ngrandfather would have known there was somewhat the matter; and, oh!\r\nit will grieve him sore whenever he is told, so the later the\r\nbetter; and besides, Mary, we\'ve sometimes little enough to go upon,\r\nand what I earn is a great help.  For grandfather takes a day here,\r\nand a day there, for botanising or going after insects, and he\'ll\r\nthink little enough of four or five shillings for a specimen; dear\r\ngrandfather! and I\'m so loath to think he should be stinted of what\r\ngives him such pleasure.  So I went to another doctor to try and get\r\nhim to say something different, and he said, \'Oh, it was only\r\nweakness,\' and gived me a bottle of lotion; but I\'ve used three\r\nbottles (and each of \'em cost two shillings), and my eye is so much\r\nworse, not hurting so much, but I can\'t see a bit with it.  There\r\nnow, Mary," continued she, shutting one eye, "now you only look like\r\na great black shadow, with the edges dancing and sparkling."\r\n\r\n"And can you see pretty well with th\' other?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, pretty near as well as ever.  Th\' only difference is, that if\r\nI sew a long time together, a bright spot like th\' sun comes right\r\nwhere I\'m looking; all the rest is quite clear but just where I want\r\nto see.  I\'ve been to both doctors again and now they\'re both o\' the\r\nsame story; and I suppose I\'m going dark as fast as may be.  Plain\r\nwork pays so bad, and mourning has been so plentiful this\r\nwinter, that I were tempted to take in any black work I could; and\r\nnow I\'m suffering from it."\r\n\r\n"And yet, Margaret, you\'re going on taking it in; that\'s what you\'d\r\ncall foolish in another."\r\n\r\n"It is, Mary! and yet what can I do?  Folk mun live; and I think I\r\nshould go blind any way, and I daren\'t tell grandfather, else I\r\nwould leave it off; but he will so fret."\r\n\r\nMargaret rocked herself backward and forward to still her emotion.\r\n\r\n"O Mary!" she said, "I try to get his face off by heart, and I stare\r\nat him so when he\'s not looking, and then shut my eyes to see if I\r\ncan remember his dear face.  There\'s one thing, Mary, that serves a\r\nbit to comfort me.  You\'ll have heard of old Jacob Butterworth, the\r\nsinging weaver?  Well, I know\'d him a bit, so I went to him, and\r\nsaid how I wished he\'d teach me the right way o\' singing; and he\r\nsays I\'ve a rare fine voice, and I go once a week, and take a lesson\r\nfra\' him.  He\'s been a grand singer in his day.  He led the choruses\r\nat the Festivals, and got thanked many a time by London folk; and\r\none foreign singer, Madame Catalani, turned round and shook him by\r\nth\' hand before the Oud Church* full o\' people.  He says I may gain\r\never so much money by singing; but I don\'t know.  Any rate, it\'s sad\r\nwork, being blind."\r\n\r\n     *Old Church; now the Cathedral of Manchester,\r\n\r\nShe took up her sewing, saying her eyes were rested now, and for\r\nsome time they sewed on in silence.\r\n\r\nSuddenly there were steps heard in the little paved court, person\r\nafter person ran past the curtained window.\r\n\r\n"Something\'s up" said Mary.  She went to the door, and stopping the\r\nfirst person she saw, inquired the cause of the Commotion.\r\n\r\n"Eh, wench! donna ye see the fire-light?  Carsons\' mill is blazing\r\naway like fun" and away her informant ran.\r\n\r\n"Come, Margaret, on wi\' your bonnet, and let\'s go to see Carsons\'\r\nmill; it\'s afire, and they say a burning mill is such a grand sight.\r\nI never saw one."\r\n\r\n"Well, I think it\'s a fearful sight.  Besides, I\'ve all this work to\r\ndo."\r\n\r\nBut Mary coaxed in her sweet manner, and with her gentle caresses,\r\npromising to help with the gowns all night long, if necessary, nay,\r\nsaying she should quite enjoy it.\r\n\r\nThe truth was, Margaret\'s secret weighed heavily and painfully on\r\nher mind, and she felt her inability to comfort; besides, she wanted\r\nto change the current of Margaret\'s thoughts; and in addition to\r\nthese unselfish feelings, came the desire she had honestly\r\nexpressed, of seeing a factory on fire.\r\n\r\nSo in two minutes they were ready.  At the threshold of the house\r\nthey met John Barton, to whom they told their errand.\r\n\r\n"Carsons\' mill!  Ay, there is a mill on fire somewhere, sure enough\r\nby the light, and it will be a rare blaze, for there\'s not a drop o\'\r\nwater to be got.  And much Carsons will care, for they\'re well\r\ninsured, and the machines are a\' th\' oud-fashioned kind.  See if\r\nthey don\'t think it a fine thing for themselves.  They\'ll not thank\r\nthem as tries to put it out."\r\n\r\nHe gave way for the impatient girls to pass.  Guided by the ruddy\r\nlight more than by any exact knowledge of the streets that led to\r\nthe mill, they scampered along with bent heads, facing the terrible\r\neast wind as best they might.\r\n\r\nCarsons\' mill ran lengthways from east to west.  Along it went one\r\nof the oldest thoroughfares in Manchester.  Indeed, all that part of\r\nthe town was comparatively old; it was there that the first cotton\r\nmills were built, and the crowded alleys and back streets of the\r\nneighbourhood made a fire there particularly to be dreaded.  The\r\nstaircase of the mill ascended from the entrance at the western end,\r\nwhich faced into a wide, dingy-looking street, consisting\r\nprincipally of public-houses, pawnbrokers\' shops, rag and bone\r\nwarehouses, and dirty provision shops.  The other, the east end of\r\nthe factory, fronted into a very narrow back street, not twenty feet\r\nwide, and miserably lighted and paved.  Right against this end of\r\nthe factory were the gable ends of the last house in the principal\r\nstreet--a house which from its size, its handsome stone facings, and\r\nthe attempt at ornament in the front, had probably been once a\r\ngentleman\'s house; but now the light which streamed from its\r\nenlarged front windows made clear the interior of the splendidly\r\nfitted-up room, with its painted walls, its pillared recesses, its\r\ngilded and gorgeous fittings-up, its miserable squalid inmates.  It\r\nwas a gin palace.\r\n\r\nMary almost wished herself away, so fearful (as Margaret had said)\r\nwas the sight when they joined the crowd assembled to witness the\r\nfire.  There was a murmur of many voices whenever the roaring of the\r\nflames ceased for an instant.  It was easy to perceive the mass were\r\ndeeply interested.\r\n\r\n"What do they say?" asked Margaret of a neighbour in the crowd, as\r\nshe caught a few words clear and distinct from the general murmur.\r\n\r\n"There never is any one in the mill, surely!" exclaimed Mary, as the\r\nsea of upward-turned faces moved with one accord to the eastern end,\r\nlooking into Dunham Street, the narrow back lane already mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe western end of the mill, whither the raging flames were driven\r\nby the wind, was crowned and turreted with triumphant fire.  It sent\r\nforth its infernal tongues from every window hole, licking the black\r\nwalls with amorous fierceness; it was swayed or fell before the\r\nmighty gale, only to rise higher and yet higher, to ravage and roar\r\nyet more wildly.  This part of the roof fell in with an astounding\r\ncrash, while the crowd struggled more and more to press into Dunham\r\nStreet, for what were magnificent terrible flames--what were falling\r\ntimbers or tottering walls, in comparison with human life?\r\n\r\nThere, where the devouring flames had been repelled by the yet more\r\npowerful wind, but where yet black smoke gushed out from every\r\naperture--there, at one of the windows on the fourth story, or\r\nrather a doorway where a crane was fixed to hoist up goods, might\r\noccasionally be seen, when the thick gusts of smoke cleared\r\npartially away for an instant, the imploring figures of two men.\r\nThey had remained after the rest of the workmen for some reason or\r\nother, and, owing to the wind having driven the fire in the opposite\r\ndirection, had perceived no sight or sound of alarm, till long after\r\n(if anything could be called long in that throng of terrors which\r\npassed by in less than half-an-hour) the fire had consumed the old\r\nwooden staircase at the other end of the building.  I am not sure\r\nwhether it was not the first sound of the rushing crowd below that\r\nmade them fully aware of their awful position.\r\n\r\n"Where are the engines?" asked Margaret of her neighbour.\r\n\r\n"They\'re coming, no doubt; but bless you, I think it\'s bare ten\r\nminutes since we first found out th\' fire; it rages so wi\' this\r\nwind, and all so dry-like."\r\n\r\n"Is no one gone for a ladder?" gasped Mary, as the men were\r\nperceptibly, though not audibly, praying the great multitude below\r\nfor help.\r\n\r\n"Ay, Wilson\'s son and another man were off like a shot, well-nigh\r\nfive minutes ago.  But th\' masons, and slaters, and such like, have\r\nleft their work, and locked up the yards."\r\n\r\nWilson, then, was that man whose figure loomed out against the\r\never-increasing dull hot light behind, whenever the smoke was clear--\r\nwas that George Wilson?  Mary sickened with terror.  She knew he\r\nworked for Carsons; but at first she had had no idea that any lives\r\nwere in danger; and since she had become aware of this, the heated\r\nair, the roaring flames, the dizzy light, and the agitated and\r\nmurmuring crowd, had bewildered her thoughts.\r\n\r\n"Oh! let us go home, Margaret; I cannot stay."\r\n\r\n"We cannot go!  See how we are wedged in by folks.  Poor Mary! ye\r\nwon\'t hanker after a fire again.  Hark! listen!"  For through the\r\nhushed crowd pressing round the angle of the mill, and filling up\r\nDunham Street, might be heard the rattle of the engine, the heavy,\r\nquick tread of loaded horses.\r\n\r\n"Thank God!" said Margaret\'s neighbour, "the engine\'s come."\r\n\r\nAnother pause; the plugs were stiff, and water could not be got.\r\n\r\nThen there was a pressure through the crowd, the front rows bearing\r\nback on those behind, till the girls were sick with the close\r\nramming confinement.  Then a relaxation, and a breathing freely once\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n"\'Twas young Wilson and a fireman wi\' a ladder," said Margaret\'s\r\nneighbour, a tall man who could overlook the crowd.\r\n\r\n"Oh, tell us what you see?" begged Mary.\r\n\r\n"They\'ve getten it fixed against the gin-shop wall.  One o\' the men\r\ni\' the factory has fell back; dazed wi\' the smoke, I\'ll warrant.\r\nThe floor\'s not given way there.  God!" said he, bringing his eye\r\nlower down, "the ladder\'s too short!  It\'s a\' over wi\' them, poor\r\nchaps.  Th\' fire\'s coming slow and sure to that end, and afore\r\nthey\'ve either getten water, or another ladder, they\'ll be dead out\r\nand out.  Lord have mercy on them!"\r\n\r\nA sob, as if of excited women, was heard in the hush of the crowd.\r\nAnother pressure like the former!  Mary clung to Margaret\'s arm with\r\na pinching grasp, and longed to faint, and be insensible, to escape\r\nfrom the oppressing misery of her sensations.  A minute or two.\r\n\r\n"They\'ve taken th\' ladder into th\' Temple of Apollor.  Can\'t press\r\nback with it to the yard it came from."\r\n\r\nA mighty shout arose; a sound to wake the dead.  Up on high,\r\nquivering in the air, was seen the end of the ladder, protruding out\r\nof a garret window, in the gable end of the gin palace, nearly\r\nopposite to the doorway where the men had been seen.  Those in the\r\ncrowd nearest the factory, and consequently best able to see up to\r\nthe garret window, said that several men were holding one end, and\r\nguiding by their weight its passage to the doorway.  The garret\r\nwindow-frame had been taken out before the crowd below were aware of\r\nthe attempt.\r\n\r\nAt length--for it seemed long, measured by beating hearts, though\r\nscarce two minutes had elapsed--the ladder was fixed, an aerial\r\nbridge at a dizzy height, across the narrow street.\r\n\r\nEvery eye was fixed in unwinking anxiety, and people\'s very\r\nbreathing seemed stilled in suspense.  The men were nowhere to be\r\nseen, but the wind appeared, for the moment, higher than ever, and\r\ndrove back the invading flames to the other end.\r\n\r\nMary and Margaret could see now; right above them danced the ladder\r\nin the wind.  The crowd pressed back from under; firemen\'s helmets\r\nappeared at the window, holding the ladder firm, when a man, with\r\nquick, steady tread, and unmoving head, passed from one side to the\r\nother.  The multitude did not even whisper while he crossed the\r\nperilous bridge, which quivered under him; but when he was across,\r\nsafe comparatively in the factory, a cheer arose for an instant,\r\nchecked, however, almost immediately, by the uncertainty of the\r\nresult, and the desire not in any way to shake the nerves of the\r\nbrave fellow who had cast his life on such a die.\r\n\r\n"There he is again!" sprung to the lips of many, as they saw him at\r\nthe doorway, standing as if for an instant to breathe a mouthful of\r\nthe fresher air, before he trusted himself to cross.  On his\r\nshoulders he bore an insensible body.\r\n\r\n"It\'s Jem Wilson and his father," whispered Margaret; but Mary knew\r\nit before.  The people were sick with anxious terror.  He could no\r\nlonger balance himself with his arms; everything must depend on nerve\r\nand eye.  They saw the latter was fixed, by the position of the head,\r\nwhich never wavered; the ladder shook under the double weight; but\r\nstill he never moved his head--he dared not look below.  It seemed\r\nan age before the crossing was accomplished.  At last the window was\r\ngained; the bearer relieved from his burden; both had disappeared.\r\n\r\nThen the multitude might shout; and above the roaring flames, louder\r\nthan the blowing of the mighty wind, arose that tremendous burst of\r\napplause at the success of the daring enterprise.  Then a shrill cry\r\nwas heard, asking--\r\n\r\n"Is the oud man alive, and likely to do?"\r\n\r\n"Ay," answered one of the firemen to the hushed crowd below.  "He\'s\r\ncoming round finely, now he\'s had a dash of cowd water."\r\n\r\nHe drew back his head; and the eager inquiries, the shouts, the\r\nsea-like murmurs of the moving rolling mass began again to be\r\nheard--but only for an instant.  In far less time than even that in\r\nwhich I have endeavoured briefly to describe the pause of events,\r\nthe same bold hero stepped again upon the ladder, with evident\r\npurpose to rescue the man yet remaining in the burning mill.\r\n\r\nHe went across in the same quick steady manner as before, and the\r\npeople below, made less acutely anxious by his previous success,\r\nwere talking to each other, shouting out intelligence of the\r\nprogress of the fire at the other end of the factory, telling of the\r\nendeavours of the firemen at that part to obtain water, while the\r\nclosely-packed body of men heaved and rolled from side to side.  It\r\nwas different from the former silent breathless hush.  I do not know\r\nif it were from this cause, or from the recollection of peril past,\r\nor that he looked below, in the breathing moment before returning\r\nwith the remaining person (a slight little man) slung across his\r\nshoulders, but Jem Wilson\'s step was less steady, his tread more\r\nuncertain; he seemed to feel with his foot for the next round of the\r\nladder, to waver, and finally to stop half-way.  By this time the\r\ncrowd was still enough; in the awful instant that intervened no one\r\ndurst speak, even to encourage.  Many turned sick with terror, and\r\nshut their eyes to avoid seeing the catastrophe they dreaded.  It\r\ncame.  The brave man swayed from side to side, at first as slightly\r\nas if only balancing himself; but he was evidently losing nerve, and\r\neven sense; it was only wonderful how the animal instinct of\r\nself-preservation did not overcome every generous feeling, and impel\r\nhim at once to drop the helpless, inanimate body he carried; perhaps\r\nthe same instinct told him, that the sudden loss of so heavy a\r\nweight would of itself be a great and imminent danger.\r\n\r\n"Help me; she\'s fainted," cried Margaret.  But no one heeded.  All\r\neyes were directed upwards.  At this point of time a rope, with a\r\nrunning noose, was dexterously thrown by one of the firemen, after\r\nthe manner of a lasso, over the head and round the bodies of the two\r\nmen.  True, it was with rude and slight adjustment: but slight as\r\nit was, it served as a steadying guide; it encouraged the sinking\r\nheart, the dizzy head.  Once more Jem stepped onwards.  He was not\r\nhurried by any jerk or pull.  Slowly and gradually the rope was\r\nhauled in, slowly and gradually did he make the four or five paces\r\nbetween him and safety.  The window was gained, and all were saved.\r\nThe multitude in the street absolutely danced with triumph, and\r\nhuzzaed, and yelled till you would have fancied their very throats\r\nwould crack; and then, with all the fickleness of interest\r\ncharacteristic of a large body of people, pressed and stumbled, and\r\ncursed and swore, in the hurry to get out of Dunham Street, and back\r\nto the immediate scene of the fire, the mighty diapason of whose\r\nroaring flames formed an awful accompaniment to the screams, and\r\nyells, and imprecations, of the struggling crowd.\r\n\r\nAs they pressed away, Margaret was left, pale and almost sinking\r\nunder the weight of Mary\'s body, which she had preserved in an\r\nupright position by keeping her arms tight round Mary\'s waist,\r\ndreading, with reason, the trampling of unheeding feet.\r\n\r\nNow, however, she gently let her down on the cold clean pavement;\r\nand the change of posture, and the difference in temperature, now\r\nthat the people had withdrawn from their close neighbourhood,\r\nspeedily restored her to consciousness.\r\n\r\nHer first glance was bewildered and uncertain.  She had forgotten\r\nwhere she was.  Her cold, hard bed felt strange; the murky glare in\r\nthe sky affrighted her.  She shut her eyes to think, to recollect.\r\n\r\nHer next look was upwards.  The fearful bridge had been withdrawn;\r\nthe window was unoccupied.\r\n\r\n"They are safe," said Margaret.\r\n\r\n"All?  Are all safe, Margaret?" asked Mary.\r\n\r\n"Ask yon fireman, and he\'ll tell you more about it than I can.  But\r\nI know they\'re all safe."\r\n\r\nThe fireman hastily corroborated Margaret\'s words.\r\n\r\n"Why did you let Jem Wilson go twice?" asked Margaret.\r\n\r\n"Let--why, we could not hinder him.  As soon as ever he\'d heard his\r\nfather speak (which he was na long a doing), Jem were off like a\r\nshot; only saying he knowed better nor us where to find t\'other man.\r\nWe\'d all ha\' gone, if he had na been in such a hurry, for no one can\r\nsay as Manchester firemen is ever backward when there\'s danger."\r\n\r\nSo saying, he ran off; and the two girls, without remark or\r\ndiscussion, turned homewards.  They were overtaken by the elder\r\nWilson, pale, grimy, and blear-eyed, but apparently, as strong and\r\nwell as ever.  He loitered a minute or two alongside of them giving\r\nan account of his detention in the mill; he then hastily wished\r\ngood-night, saying he must go home and tell his missis he was all\r\nsafe and well: but after he had gone a few steps, he turned back,\r\ncame on Mary\'s side of the pavement, and in an earnest whisper,\r\nwhich Margaret could not avoid hearing, he said--\r\n\r\n"Mary, if my boy comes across you to-night, give him a kind word or\r\ntwo for my sake.  Do! bless you, there\'s a good wench."\r\n\r\nMary hung her head and answered not a word, and in an instant he was\r\ngone.\r\n\r\nWhen they arrived at home, they found John Barton smoking his pipe,\r\nunwilling to question; yet very willing to hear all the details they\r\ncould give him.  Margaret went over the whole story, and it was\r\namusing to watch his gradually increasing interest and excitement.\r\nFirst, the regular puffing abated, then ceased.  Then the pipe was\r\nfairly taken out of his mouth, and held suspended.  Then he rose,\r\nand at every further point he came a step nearer to the narrator.\r\n\r\nWhen it was ended he swore (an unusual thing for him) that if Jem\r\nWilson wanted Mary he should have her tomorrow, if he had not a\r\npenny to keep her.\r\n\r\nMargaret laughed, but Mary, who was now recovered from her\r\nagitation, pouted and looked angry.\r\n\r\nThe work which they had left was resumed: but with full hearts\r\nfingers never go very quickly; and I am sorry to say, that owing to\r\nthe fire, the two younger Miss Ogdens were in such grief for the\r\nloss of their excellent father, that they were unable to appear\r\nbefore the little circle of sympathising friends gathered together\r\nto comfort the widow, and see the funeral set off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.    POVERTY AND DEATH.\r\n\r\n     "How little can the rich man know\r\n        Of what the poor man feels,\r\n      When Want, like some dark demon foe,\r\n        Nearer and nearer steals!\r\n\r\n     "HE never tramp\'d the weary round,\r\n        A stroke of work to gain,\r\n      And sicken\'d at the dreaded sound\r\n        Which tells he seeks in vain.\r\n\r\n     "Foot-sore, heart-sore, HE never came\r\n        Back through the winter\'s wind,\r\n      To a dank cellar, there no flame,\r\n        No light, no food, to find.\r\n\r\n     "HE never saw his darlings lie\r\n        Shivering, the flags their bed\r\n      HE never heard that maddening cry,\r\n        \'Daddy, a bit of bread!\'"\r\n                            --MANCHESTER SONG.\r\n\r\nJohn Barton was not far wrong in his idea that the Messrs. Carson\r\nwould not be over-much grieved for the consequences of the fire in\r\ntheir mill.  They were well insured; the machinery lacked the\r\nimprovements of late years, and worked but poorly in comparison with\r\nthat which might now be procured.  Above all, trade was very slack;\r\ncottons could find no market, and goods lay packed and piled in many\r\na warehouse.  The mills were merely worked to keep the machinery,\r\nhuman and metal, in some kind of order and readiness for better\r\ntimes.  So this was an excellent opportunity, Messrs. Carson\r\nthought, for refitting their factory with first-rate improvements,\r\nfor which the insurance money would amply pay.  They were in no\r\nhurry about the business, however.  The weekly drain of wages given\r\nfor labour, useless in the present state of the market, was stopped.\r\nThe partners had more leisure than they had known for years; and\r\npromised wives and daughters all manner of pleasant excursions, as\r\nsoon as the weather should become more genial.  It was a pleasant\r\nthing to be able to lounge over breakfast with a review or newspaper\r\nin hand; to have time for becoming acquainted with agreeable and\r\naccomplished daughters, on whose education no money had been spared,\r\nbut whose fathers, shut up during a long day with calicoes and\r\naccounts, had so seldom had leisure to enjoy their daughters\'\r\ntalents.  There were happy family evenings, now that the men of\r\nbusiness had time for domestic enjoyments.  There is another side to\r\nthe picture.  There were homes over which Carsons\' fire threw a\r\ndeep, terrible gloom; the homes of those who would fain work, and no\r\nman gave unto them--the homes of those to whom leisure was a curse.\r\nThere, the family music was hungry wails, when week after week\r\npassed by, and there was no work to be had, and consequently no\r\nwages to pay for the bread the children cried aloud for in their\r\nyoung impatience of suffering.  There was no breakfast to lounge\r\nover; their lounge was taken in bed, to try and keep warmth in them\r\nthat bitter March weather, and, by being quiet, to deaden the\r\ngnawing wolf within.  Many a penny that would have gone little way\r\nenough in oatmeal or potatoes, bought opium to still the hungry\r\nlittle ones, and make them forget their uneasiness in heavy troubled\r\nsleep.  It was mother\'s mercy.  The evil and the good of our nature\r\ncame out strongly then.  There were desperate fathers; there were\r\nbitter-tongued mothers (O God! what wonder!); there were reckless\r\nchildren; the very closest bonds of nature were snapt in that time\r\nof trial and distress.  There was Faith such as the rich can never\r\nimagine on earth; there was "Love strong as death"; and self-denial,\r\namong rude, coarse men, akin to that of Sir Philip Sidney\'s most\r\nglorious deed.  The vices of the poor sometimes astound us HERE; but\r\nwhen the secrets of all hearts shall be made known, their virtues\r\nwill astound us in far greater degree.  Of this I am certain.\r\n\r\nAs the cold, bleak spring came on (spring, in name alone), and\r\nconsequently as trade continued dead, other mills shortened hours,\r\nturned off hands, and finally stopped work altogether.\r\n\r\nBarton worked short hours.  Wilson, of course, being a hand in\r\nCarsons\' factory, had no work at all.  But his son, working at an\r\nengineer\'s, and a steady man, obtained wages enough to maintain all\r\nthe family in a careful way.  Still it preyed on Wilson\'s mind to be\r\nso long indebted to his son.  He was out of spirits, and depressed.\r\nBarton was morose, and soured towards mankind as a body, and the\r\nrich in particular.  One evening, when the clear light at six\r\no\'clock contrasted strangely with the Christmas cold, and when the\r\nbitter wind piped down every entry, and through every cranny, Barton\r\nsat brooding over his stinted fire, and listening for Mary\'s step,\r\nin unacknowledged trust that her presence would cheer him.  The door\r\nwas opened, and Wilson came breathless in.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve not got a bit o\' money by you, Barton?" asked he.\r\n\r\n"Not I; who has now, I\'d like to know.  Whatten you want it for?"\r\n\r\n"I donnot* want it for mysel\', tho\' we\'ve none to spare.  But don ye\r\nknow Ben Davenport as worked at Carsons?  He\'s down wi\' the fever,\r\nand ne\'er a stick o\' fire nor a cowd** potato in the house."\r\n\r\n     *"Don" is constantly used in Lancashire for "do"; as it was\r\n      by our older writers.\r\n       "And that may non Hors DON."--SIR J. MANDEVILLE.\r\n       "But for th\' entent to DON this sinne."--CHAUCER.\r\n    **Cowd; cold.  Teut., kaud.  Dutch, koud.\r\n\r\n"I han got no money, I tell ye," said Barton.  Wilson looked\r\ndisappointed.  Barton tried not to be interested, but he could not\r\nhelp it in spite of his gruffness.  He rose, and went to the\r\ncupboard (his wife\'s pride long ago).  There lay the remains of his\r\ndinner, hastily put by ready for supper.  Bread, and a slice of cold\r\nfat boiled bacon.  He wrapped them in his handkerchief, put them in\r\nthe crown of his hat, and said, "Come, let us be going."\r\n\r\n"Going--art thou going to work this time o\' day?"\r\n\r\n"No, stupid, to be sure not.  Going to see the chap thou spoke on."\r\nSo they put on their hats and set out.  On the way Wilson said\r\nDavenport was a good fellow, though too much of the Methodee; that\r\nhis children were too young to work, but not too young to be cold\r\nand hungry; that they had sunk lower and lower, and pawned thing\r\nafter thing, and that they now lived in a cellar in Berry Street,\r\noff Store Street.  Barton growled inarticulate words of no\r\nbenevolent import to a large class of mankind, and so they went\r\nalong till they arrived in Berry Street.  It was unpaved: and down\r\nthe middle a gutter forced its way, every now and then forming pools\r\nin the holes with which the street abounded.  Never was the old\r\nEdinburgh cry of Gardez l\'eau! more necessary than in this street.\r\nAs they passed, women from their doors tossed household slops of\r\nEVERY description into the gutter; they ran into the next pool,\r\nwhich overflowed and stagnated.  Heaps of ashes were the\r\nstepping-stones, on which the passer-by, who cared in the least for\r\ncleanliness, took care not to put his foot.  Our friends were not\r\ndainty, but even they picked their way, till they got to some steps\r\nleading down to a small area, where a person standing would have his\r\nhead about one foot below the level of the street, and might at the\r\nsame time, without the least motion of his body, touch the window of\r\nthe cellar and the damp muddy wall right opposite.  You went down\r\none step even from the foul area into the cellar in which a family\r\nof human beings lived.  It was very dark inside.  The window-panes,\r\nmany of them, were broken and stuffed with rags, which was reason\r\nenough for the dusky light that pervaded the place even at midday.\r\nAfter the account I have given of the state of the street, no one\r\ncan be surprised that on going into the cellar inhabited by\r\nDavenport, the smell was so foetid as almost to knock the two men\r\ndown.  Quickly recovering themselves, as those inured to such things\r\ndo, they began to penetrate the thick darkness of the place, and to\r\nsee three or four little children rolling on the damp, nay wet brick\r\nfloor, through which the stagnant, filthy moisture of the street\r\noozed up; the fire-place was empty and black; the wife sat on her\r\nhusband\'s lair, and cried in the dark loneliness.\r\n\r\n"See, missis, I\'m back again.--Hold your noise, children, and don\'t\r\nmither* your mammy for bread; here\'s a chap as has got some for\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n     *Mither; to trouble and perplex.\r\n       "I\'m welly mithered"--I\'m well-nigh crazed.\r\n\r\nIn that dim light, which was darkness to strangers, they clustered\r\nround Barton, and tore from him the food he had brought with him.\r\nIt was a large hunch of bread, but it vanished in an instant.\r\n\r\n"We mun do summut for \'em," said he to Wilson.  "Yo stop here, and\r\nI\'ll be back in half-an-hour."\r\n\r\nSo he strode, and ran, and hurried home.  He emptied into the\r\never-useful pocket-handkerchief the little meal remaining in the\r\nmug.  Mary would have her tea at Miss Simmonds\'; her food for the\r\nday was safe.  Then he went upstairs for his better coat, and his\r\none, gay red-and-yellow silk pocket-handkerchief--his jewels, his\r\nplate, his valuables, these were.  He went to the pawn-shop; he\r\npawned them for five shillings; he stopped not, nor stayed, till he\r\nwas once more in London Road, within five minutes\' walk of Berry\r\nStreet--then he loitered in his gait, in order to discover the shops\r\nhe wanted.  He bought meat, and a loaf of bread, candles, chips, and\r\nfrom a little retail yard he purchased a couple of hundredweights of\r\ncoal.  Some money still remained--all destined for them, but he did\r\nnot yet know how best to spend it.  Food, light, and warmth, he had\r\ninstantly seen were necessary; for luxuries he would wait.  Wilson\'s\r\neyes filled with tears when he saw Barton enter with his purchases.\r\nHe understood it all, and longed to be once more in work that he\r\nmight help in some of these material ways, without feeling that he\r\nwas using his son\'s money.  But though "silver and gold he had\r\nnone," he gave heart-service and love--works of far more value.  Nor\r\nwas John Barton behind in these.  "The fever" was (as it usually is\r\nin Manchester) of a low, putrid, typhoid kind; brought on by\r\nmiserable living, filthy neighbourhood, and great depression of mind\r\nand body.  It is virulent, malignant, and highly infectious.  But\r\nthe poor are fatalists with regard to infection! and well for them\r\nit is so, for in their crowded dwellings no invalid can be isolated.\r\nWilson asked Barton if he thought he should catch it, and was\r\nlaughed at for his idea.\r\n\r\nThe two men, rough, tender nurses as they were, lighted the fire,\r\nwhich smoked and puffed into the room as if it did not know the way\r\nup the damp, unused chimney.  The very smoke seemed purifying and\r\nhealthy in the thick clammy air.  The children clamoured again for\r\nbread; but this time Barton took a piece first to the poor,\r\nhelpless, hopeless woman, who still sat by the side of her husband,\r\nlistening to his anxious miserable mutterings.  She took the bread,\r\nwhen it was put into her hand, and broke a bit, but could not eat.\r\nShe was past hunger.  She fell down on the floor with a heavy\r\nunresisting bang.  The men looked puzzled.  "She\'s wellnigh\r\nclemmed," said Barton.  "Folk do say one mustn\'t give clemmed people\r\nmuch to eat; but, bless us, she\'ll eat nought."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell yo what I\'ll do," said Wilson.  "I\'ll take these two big\r\nlads, as does nought but fight, home to my missis for tonight, and\r\nI\'ll get a jug o\' tea.  Them women always does best with tea, and\r\nsuch-like slop."\r\n\r\nSo Barton was now left alone with a little child, crying (when it\r\nhad done eating) for mammy; with a fainting, dead-like woman; and\r\nwith the sick man, whose mutterings were rising up to screams and\r\nshrieks of agonised anxiety.  He carried the woman to the fire, and\r\nchafed her hands.  He looked around for something to raise her head.\r\nThere was literally nothing but some loose bricks.  However, those\r\nhe got; and taking off his coat he covered them with it as well as\r\nhe could.  He pulled her feet to the fire, which now began to emit\r\nsome faint heat.  He looked round for water, but the poor woman had\r\nbeen too weak to drag herself out to the distant pump, and water\r\nthere was none.  He snatched the child, and ran up the area-steps to\r\nthe room above, and borrowed their only saucepan with some water in\r\nit.  Then he began, with the useful skill of a working-man, to make\r\nsome gruel; and when it was hastily made, he seized a battered iron\r\ntable-spoon (kept when many other little things had been sold in a\r\nlot, in order to feed baby), and with it he forced one or two drops\r\nbetween her clenched teeth.  The mouth opened mechanically to\r\nreceive more, and gradually she revived.  She sat up and looked\r\nround; and recollecting all, fell down again in weak and passive\r\ndespair.  Her little child crawled to her, and wiped with its\r\nfingers the thick-coming tears which she now had strength to weep.\r\nIt was now high time to attend to the man.  He lay on straw, so damp\r\nand mouldy, no dog would have chosen it in preference to flags; over\r\nit was a piece of sacking, coming next to his worn skeleton of a\r\nbody; above him was mustered every article of clothing that could be\r\nspared by mother or children this bitter weather; and in addition to\r\nhis own, these might have given as much warmth as one blanket, could\r\nthey have been kept on him; but as he restlessly tossed to and fro,\r\nthey fell off and left him shivering in spite of the burning heat of\r\nhis skin.  Every now and then he started up in his naked madness,\r\nlooking like the prophet of woe in the fearful plague-picture; but\r\nhe soon fell again in exhaustion, and Barton found he must be\r\nclosely watched, lest in these falls he should injure himself\r\nagainst the hard brick floor.  He was thankful when Wilson\r\nre-appeared, carrying in both hands a jug of steaming tea, intended\r\nfor the poor wife; but when the delirious husband saw drink, he\r\nsnatched at it with animal instinct, with a selfishness he had never\r\nshown in health.\r\n\r\nThen the two men consulted together.  It seemed decided, without a\r\nword being spoken on the subject, that both should spend the night\r\nwith the forlorn couple; that was settled.  But could no doctor be\r\nhad?  In all probability, no; the next day an Infirmary order must\r\nbe begged, but meanwhile the only medical advice they could have\r\nmust be from a druggist\'s.  So Barton (being the moneyed man) set\r\nout to find a shop in London Road.\r\n\r\nIt is a pretty sight to walk through a street with lighted shops;\r\nthe gas is so brilliant, the display of goods so much more vividly\r\nshown than by day, and of all shops a druggist\'s looks the most like\r\nthe tales of our childhood, from Aladdin\'s garden of enchanted\r\nfruits to the charming Rosamond with her purple jar.  No such\r\nassociations had Barton; yet he felt the contrast between the\r\nwell-filled, well-lighted shops and the dim gloomy cellar, and it\r\nmade him moody that such contrasts should exist.  They are the\r\nmysterious problem of life to more than him.  He wondered if any in\r\nall the hurrying crowd had come from such a house of mourning.  He\r\nthought they all looked joyous, and he was angry with them.  But he\r\ncould not, you cannot, read the lot of those who daily pass you by\r\nin the street.  How do you know the wild romances of their lives;\r\nthe trials, the temptations they are even now enduring, resisting,\r\nsinking under?  You may be elbowed one instant by the girl desperate\r\nin her abandonment, laughing in mad merriment with her outward\r\ngesture, while her soul is longing for the rest of the dead, and\r\nbringing itself to think of the cold flowing river as the only mercy\r\nof God remaining to her here.  You may pass the criminal, meditating\r\ncrimes at which you will to-morrow shudder with horror as you read\r\nthem.  You may push against one, humble and unnoticed, the last upon\r\nearth, who in heaven will for ever be in the immediate light of\r\nGod\'s countenance.  Errands of mercy--errands of sin--did you ever\r\nthink where all the thousands of people you daily meet are bound?\r\nBarton\'s was an errand of mercy; but the thoughts of his heart were\r\ntouched by sin, by bitter hatred of the happy, whom he, for the\r\ntime, confounded with the selfish.\r\n\r\nHe reached a druggist\'s shop, and entered.  The druggist (whose\r\nsmooth manners seemed to have been salved over with his own\r\nspermaceti) listened attentively to Barton\'s description of\r\nDavenport\'s illness; concluded it was typhus fever, very prevalent\r\nin that neighbourhood; and proceeded to make up a bottle of\r\nmedicine, sweet spirits of nitre, or some such innocent potion, very\r\ngood for slight colds, but utterly powerless to stop, for an\r\ninstant, the raging fever of the poor man it was intended to\r\nrelieve.  He recommended the same course they had previously\r\ndetermined to adopt, applying the next morning for an Infirmary\r\norder; and Barton left the shop with comfortable faith in the physic\r\ngiven him; for men of his class, if they believe in physic at all,\r\nbelieve that every description is equally efficacious.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Wilson had done what he could at Davenport\'s home.  He\r\nhad soothed, and covered the man many a time; he had fed and hushed\r\nthe little child, and spoken tenderly to the woman, who lay still in\r\nher weakness and her weariness.  He had opened a door, but only for\r\nan instant; it led into a back cellar, with a grating instead of a\r\nwindow, down which dropped the moisture from pigsties, and worse\r\nabominations.  It was not paved; the floor was one mass of bad\r\nsmelling mud.  It had never been used, for there was not an article\r\nof furniture in it; nor could a human being, much less a pig, have\r\nlived there many days.  Yet the "back apartment" made a difference\r\nin the rent.  The Davenports paid threepence more for having two\r\nrooms.  When he turned round again, he saw the woman suckling the\r\nchild from her dry, withered breast.\r\n\r\n"Surely the lad is weaned!" exclaimed he, in surprise.  "Why, how\r\nold is he?"\r\n\r\n"Going on two year," she faintly answered.  "But, oh! it keeps him\r\nquiet when I\'ve nought else to gi\' him, and he\'ll get a bit of sleep\r\nlying there, if he\'s getten nought beside.  We han done our best to\r\ngi\' the childer* food, howe\'er we pinch ourselves."\r\n\r\n     *Wickliffe uses "childre" in his Apology, page 26.\r\n\r\n"Han** ye had no money fra\' th\' town?"\r\n\r\n     **"What concord HAN light and dark."--SPENSER.\r\n\r\n"No; my master is Buckinghamshire born; and he\'s feared the town\r\nwould send him back to his parish, if he went to th\' board; so we\'ve\r\njust borne on in hope o\' better times.  But I think they\'ll never\r\ncome in my day," and the poor woman began her weak high-pitched cry\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n"Here, sup* this drop o\' gruel, and then try and get a bit o\' sleep.\r\nJohn and I will watch by your master to-night."\r\n\r\n     *"And they SOUPE the brothe thereof."--SIR J. MANDEVILLE.\r\n\r\n"God\'s blessing be on you."\r\n\r\nShe finished the gruel, and fell into a deep sleep.  Wilson covered\r\nher with his coat as well as he could, and tried to move lightly,\r\nfor fear of disturbing her; but there need have been no such dread,\r\nfor her sleep was profound and heavy with exhaustion.  Once only she\r\nroused to pull the coat round her little child.\r\n\r\nAnd now Wilson\'s care, and Barton\'s to boot, was wanted to restrain\r\nthe wild mad agony of the fevered man.  He started up, he yelled, he\r\nseemed infuriated by overwhelming anxiety.  He cursed and swore,\r\nwhich surprised Wilson, who knew his piety in health, and who did\r\nnot know the unbridled tongue of delirium.  At length he seemed\r\nexhausted, and fell asleep; and Barton and Wilson drew near the\r\nfire, and talked together in whispers.  They sat on the floor, for\r\nchairs there were none; the sole table was an old tub turned upside\r\ndown.  They put out the candle and conversed by the flickering\r\nfirelight.\r\n\r\n"Han yo known this chap long?" asked Barton.\r\n\r\n"Better nor three year.  He\'s worked wi\' Carsons that long, and were\r\nalways a steady, civil-spoken fellow, though, as I said afore,\r\nsomewhat of a Methodee.  I wish I\'d getten a letter he\'d sent his\r\nmissis, a week or two agone, when he were on tramp for work.  It did\r\nmy heart good to read it; for, yo see, I were a bit grumbling mysel;\r\nit seemed hard to be sponging on Jem, and taking a\' his flesh-meat\r\nmoney to buy bread for me and them as I ought to be keeping.  But yo\r\nknow, though I can earn nought, I mun eat summut.  Well, as I telled\r\nye, I were grumbling, when she" (indicating the sleeping woman by a\r\nnod) "brought me Ben\'s letter, for she could na\' read hersel.  It\r\nwere as good as Bible-words; ne\'er a word o\' repining; a\' about God\r\nbeing our Father, and that we mun bear patiently whate\'er He sends."\r\n\r\n"Don ye think He\'s th\' masters\' Father, too?  I\'d be loth to have\r\n\'em for brothers."\r\n\r\n"Eh, John! donna talk so; sure there\'s many and many a master as\r\ngood or better nor us."\r\n\r\n"If you think so, tell me this.  How comes it they\'re rich, and\r\nwe\'re poor?  I\'d like to know that.  Han they done as they\'d be done\r\nby for us?"\r\n\r\nBut Wilson was no arguer; no speechifier, as he would have called\r\nit.  So Barton, seeing he was likely to have it his own way, went\r\non.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll say (at least many a one does), they\'n* getten capital an\'\r\nwe\'n getten none.  I say, our labour\'s our capital, and we ought to\r\ndraw interest on that.  They get interest on their capital somehow\r\na\' this time, while ourn is lying idle, else how could they all live\r\nas they do?  Besides, there\'s many on \'em has had nought to begin\r\nwi\'; there\'s Carsons, and Duncombes, and Mengies, and many another,\r\nas comed into Manchester with clothes to their back, and that were\r\nall, and now they\'re worth their tens of thousands, a\' getten out of\r\nour labour; why, the very land as fetched but sixty pound twenty\r\nyear agone is now worth six hundred, and that, too, is owing to our\r\nlabour; but look at yo, and see me, and poor Davenport yonder;\r\nwhatten better are we?  They\'n screwed us down to the lowest peg, in\r\norder to make their great big fortunes, and build their great big\r\nhouses, and we, why we\'re just clemming, many and many of us.  Can\r\nyou say there\'s nought wrong in this?"\r\n\r\n     *"They\'n," contraction of "they han," they have.\r\n\r\n"Well, Barton, I\'ll not gainsay ye.  But Mr. Carson spoke to me\r\nafter th\' fire, and says he, \'I shall ha\' to retrench, and be very\r\ncareful in my expenditure during these bad times, I assure ye\'; so\r\nyo see th\' masters suffer too."\r\n\r\n"Han they ever seen a child o\' their\'n die for want o\' food?" asked\r\nBarton, in a low deep voice.\r\n\r\n"I donnot mean," continued he, "to say as I\'m so badly off.  I\'d\r\nscorn to speak for mysel; but when I see such men as Davenport there\r\ndying away, for very clemming, I cannot stand it.  I\'ve but gotten\r\nMary, and she keeps herself pretty much.  I think we\'ll ha\' to give\r\nup housekeeping; but that I donnot mind."\r\n\r\nAnd in this kind of talk the night, the long heavy night of\r\nwatching, wore away.  As far as they could judge, Davenport\r\ncontinued in the same state, although the symptoms varied\r\noccasionally.  The wife slept on, only roused by the cry of her\r\nchild now and then, which seemed to have power over her, when far\r\nlouder noises failed to disturb her.  The watchers agreed, that as\r\nsoon as it was likely Mr. Carson would be up and visible, Wilson\r\nshould go to his house, and beg for an Infirmary order.  At length\r\nthe grey dawn penetrated even into the dark cellar.  Davenport\r\nslept, and Barton was to remain there until Wilson\'s return; so,\r\nstepping out into the fresh air, brisk and reviving, even in that\r\nstreet of abominations, Wilson took his way to Mr. Carson\'s.\r\n\r\nWilson had about two miles to walk before he reached Mr. Carson\'s\r\nhouse, which was almost in the country.  The streets were not yet\r\nbustling and busy.  The shopmen were lazily taking down the\r\nshutters, although it was near eight o\'clock; for the day was long\r\nenough for the purchases people made in that quarter of the town,\r\nwhile trade was so flat.  One or two miserable-looking women were\r\nsetting off on their day\'s begging expedition.  But there were few\r\npeople abroad.  Mr. Carson\'s was a good house, and furnished with\r\ndisregard to expense.  But, in addition to lavish expenditure, there\r\nwas much taste shown, and many articles chosen for their beauty and\r\nelegance adorned his rooms.  As Wilson passed a window which a\r\nhousemaid had thrown open, he saw pictures and gilding, at which he\r\nwas tempted to stop and look; but then he thought it would not be\r\nrespectful.  So he hastened on to the kitchen door.  The servants\r\nseemed very busy with preparations for breakfast; but\r\ngood-naturedly, though hastily, told him to step in, and they could\r\nsoon let Mr. Carson know he was there.  So he was ushered into a\r\nkitchen hung round with glittering tins, where a roaring fire burnt\r\nmerrily, and where numbers of utensils hung round, at whose nature\r\nand use Wilson amused himself by guessing.  Meanwhile, the servants\r\nbustled to and fro; an outdoor manservant came in for orders, and\r\nsat down near Wilson.  The cook broiled steaks, and the kitchen-maid\r\ntoasted bread, and boiled eggs.\r\n\r\nThe coffee steamed upon the fire, and altogether the odours were so\r\nmixed and appetising, that Wilson began to yearn for food to break\r\nhis fast, which had lasted since dinner the day before.  If the\r\nservants had known this, they would have willingly given him meat\r\nand bread in abundance; but they were like the rest of us, and not\r\nfeeling hunger themselves, forgot it was possible another might.  So\r\nWilson\'s craving turned to sickness, while they chatted on, making\r\nthe kitchen\'s free and keen remarks upon the parlour.\r\n\r\n"How late you were last night, Thomas!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I was right weary of waiting; they told me to be at the rooms\r\nby twelve; and there I was.  But it was two o\'clock before they\r\ncalled me."\r\n\r\n"And did you wait all that time in the street?" asked the housemaid,\r\nwho had done her work for the present, and come into the kitchen for\r\na bit of gossip.\r\n\r\n"My eye as like! you don\'t think I\'m such a fool as to catch my\r\ndeath of cold, and let the horses catch their death too, as we\r\nshould ha\' done if we\'d stopped there.  No! I put th\' horses up in\r\nth\' stables at th\' Spread Eagle, and went mysel, and got a glass or\r\ntwo by th\' fire.  They\'re driving a good custom, them, wi\' coachmen.\r\nThere were five on us, and we\'d many a quart o\' ale, and gin wi\' it,\r\nto keep out th\' cold."\r\n\r\n"Mercy on us, Thomas; you\'ll get a drunkard at last!"\r\n\r\n"If I do, I know whose blame it will be.  It will be missis\'s, and\r\nnot mine.  Flesh and blood can\'t sit to be starved to death on a\r\ncoach-box, waiting for folks as don\'t know their own mind."\r\n\r\nA servant, semi-upper-housemaid, semi-lady\'s-maid, now came down\r\nwith orders from her mistress.\r\n\r\n"Thomas, you must ride to the fishmongers, and say missis can\'t give\r\nabove half-a-crown a pound for salmon for Tuesday; she\'s grumbling\r\nbecause trade\'s so bad.  And she\'ll want the carriage at three to go\r\nto the lecture, Thomas; at the Royal Execution, you know."\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay, I know."\r\n\r\n"And you\'d better all of you mind your P\'s and Q\'s, for she\'s very\r\nblack this morning.  She\'s got a bad headache."\r\n\r\n"It\'s a pity Miss Jenkins is not here to match her.  Lord! how she\r\nand missis did quarrel which had got the worst headaches; it was\r\nthat Miss Jenkins left for.  She would not give up having bad\r\nheadaches, and missis could not abide anyone to have \'em but\r\nherself."\r\n\r\n"Missis will have her breakfast upstairs, cook, and the cold\r\npartridge as was left yesterday, and put plenty of cream in her\r\ncoffee, and she thinks there\'s a roll left, and she would like it\r\nwell buttered."\r\n\r\nSo saying, the maid left the kitchen to be ready to attend to the\r\nyoung ladies\' bell when they chose to ring, after their late\r\nassembly the night before.  In the luxurious library, at the\r\nwell-spread breakfast-table, sat the two Mr. Carsons, father and\r\nson.  Both were reading--the father a newspaper, the son a review--\r\nwhile they lazily enjoyed their nicely prepared food.  The father\r\nwas a prepossessing-looking old man; perhaps self-indulgent you\r\nmight guess.  The son was strikingly handsome, and knew it.  His\r\ndress was neat and well appointed, and his manners far more\r\ngentlemanly than his father\'s.  He was the only son, and his sisters\r\nwere proud of him; his father and mother were proud of him: he\r\ncould not set up his judgment against theirs; he was proud of\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nThe door opened and in bounded Amy, the sweet youngest daughter of\r\nthe house, a lovely girl of sixteen, fresh and glowing, and bright\r\nas a rosebud.  She was too young to go to assemblies, at which her\r\nfather rejoiced, for he had little Amy with her pretty jokes, and\r\nher bird-like songs, and her playful caresses all the evening to\r\namuse him in his loneliness; and she was not too much tired like\r\nSophy and Helen, to give him her sweet company at breakfast the next\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nHe submitted willingly while she blinded him with her hands, and\r\nkissed his rough red face all over.  She took his newspaper away\r\nafter a little pretended resistance, and would not allow her brother\r\nHarry to go on with his review.\r\n\r\n"I\'m the only lady this morning, papa, so you know you must make a\r\ngreat deal of me."\r\n\r\n"My darling, I think you have your own way always, whether you\'re\r\nthe only lady or not."\r\n\r\n"Yes, papa, you\'re pretty good and obedient, I must say that; but\r\nI\'m sorry to say Harry is very naughty, and does not do what I tell\r\nhim; do you, Harry?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure I don\'t know what you mean to accuse me of, Amy; I\r\nexpected praise and not blame; for did not I get you that eau de\r\nPortugal from town, that you could not meet with at Hughes\', you\r\nlittle ungrateful puss?"\r\n\r\n"Did you? Oh, sweet Harry; you\'re as sweet as eau de Portugal\r\nyourself; you\'re almost as good as papa; but still you know you did\r\ngo and forget to ask Bigland for that rose, that new rose they say\r\nhe has got."\r\n\r\n"No, Amy, I did not forget.  I asked him, and he has got the Rose,\r\nsans reproche: but do you know, little Miss Extravagance, a very\r\nsmall one is half-a-guinea?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t mind.  Papa will give it me, won\'t you, dear father?\r\nHe knows his little daughter cannot live without flowers and\r\nscents."\r\n\r\nMr. Carson tried to refuse his darling, but she coaxed him into\r\nacquiescence, saying she must have it, it was one of her\r\nnecessaries.  Life was not worth having without flowers.\r\n\r\n"Then, Amy," said her brother, "try and be content with peonies and\r\ndandelions."\r\n\r\n"Oh, you wretch!  I don\'t call them flowers.  Besides, you\'re every\r\nbit as extravagant.  Who gave half-a-crown for a bunch of lilies of\r\nthe valley at Yates\', a month ago, and then would not let his poor\r\nlittle sister have them, though she went on her knees to beg them?\r\nAnswer me that, Master Hal."\r\n\r\n"Not on compulsion," replied her brother, smiling with his mouth,\r\nwhile his eyes had an irritated expression, and he went first red,\r\nthen pale, with vexed embarrassment.\r\n\r\n"If you please, sir," said a servant, entering the room, "here\'s one\r\nof the mill people wanting to see you; his name is Wilson, he says."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll come to him directly; stay, tell him to come in here."\r\n\r\nAmy danced off into the conservatory which opened out of the room,\r\nbefore the gaunt, pale, unwashed, unshaven weaver was ushered in.\r\nThere he stood at the door sleeking his hair with old country habit,\r\nand every now and then stealing a glance round at the splendour of\r\nthe apartment.\r\n\r\n"Well, Wilson, and what do you want to-day, man?"\r\n\r\n"Please, sir, Davenport\'s ill of the fever, and I\'m come to know if\r\nyou\'ve got an Infirmary order for him?"\r\n\r\n"Davenport--Davenport; who is the fellow?  I don\'t know the name."\r\n\r\n"He\'s worked in your factory better nor three years, sir."\r\n\r\n"Very likely; I don\'t pretend to know the names of the men I employ;\r\nthat I leave to the overlooker.  So he\'s ill, eh?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, sir, he\'s very bad; we want to get him in at the Fever Wards."\r\n\r\n"I doubt if I\'ve an in-patient\'s order to spare at present; but I\'ll\r\ngive you an out-patient\'s and welcome."\r\n\r\nSo saying, he rose up, unlocked a drawer, pondered a minute, and\r\nthen gave Wilson an out-patient\'s order.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the younger Mr. Carson had ended his review, and began to\r\nlisten to what was going on.  He finished his breakfast, got up, and\r\npulled five shillings out of his pocket, which he gave to Wilson as\r\nhe passed him, for the "poor fellow."  He went past quickly, and\r\ncalling for his horse, mounted gaily, and rode away.  He was anxious\r\nto be in time to have a look and a smile from lovely  Mary Barton,\r\nas she went to Miss Simmonds\'.  But to-day he was to be\r\ndisappointed.  Wilson left the house, not knowing whether to be\r\npleased or grieved.  They had all spoken kindly to him, and who\r\ncould tell if they might not inquire into Davenport\'s case, and do\r\nsomething for him and his family.  Besides, the cook, who, when she\r\nhad had time to think, after breakfast was sent in, had noticed his\r\npaleness, had had meat and bread ready to put in his hand when he\r\ncame out of the parlour; and a full stomach makes every one of us\r\nmore hopeful.  When he reached Berry Street, he had persuaded\r\nhimself he bore good news, and felt almost elated in his heart.  But\r\nit fell when he opened the cellar-door, and saw Barton and the wife\r\nboth bending over the sick man\'s couch with awestruck, saddened\r\nlook.\r\n\r\n"Come here," said Barton.  "There\'s a change comed over him sin\' yo\r\nleft, is there not?"\r\n\r\nWilson looked.  The flesh was sunk, the features prominent, bony,\r\nand rigid.  The fearful clay-colour of death was over all.  But the\r\neyes were open and sensitive, though the films of the grave were\r\nsetting upon them.\r\n\r\n"He wakened fra\' his sleep, as yo left him in, and began to mutter\r\nand moan; but he soon went off again, and we never knew he were\r\nawake till he called his wife, but now she\'s here he\'s gotten nought\r\nto say to her."\r\n\r\nMost probably, as they all felt, he could not speak, for his\r\nstrength was fast ebbing.  They stood round him still and silent;\r\neven the wife checked her sobs, though her heart was like to break.\r\nShe held her child to her breast, to try and keep him quiet.  Their\r\neyes were all fixed on the yet living one, whose moments of life\r\nwere passing so rapidly away.  At length he brought (with jerking\r\nconvulsive effort) his two hands into the attitude of prayer.  They\r\nsaw his lips move, and bent to catch the words, which came in gasps,\r\nand not in tones.\r\n\r\n"O Lord God!  I thank thee, that the hard struggle of living is\r\nover."\r\n\r\n"O Ben! Ben!" wailed forth his wife, "have you no thought for me?  O\r\nBen!  Ben! do say one word to help me through life."\r\n\r\nHe could not speak again.  The trump of the archangel would set his\r\ntongue free; but not a word more would it utter till then.  Yet he\r\nheard, he understood, and though sight failed, he moved his hand\r\ngropingly over the covering.  They knew what he meant, and guided it\r\nto her head, bowed and hidden in her hands, when she had sunk in her\r\nwoe.  It rested there with a feeble pressure of endearment.  The\r\nface grew beautiful, as the soul neared God.  A peace beyond\r\nunderstanding came over it.  The hand was a heavy stiff weight on\r\nthe wife\'s head.  No more grief or sorrow for him.  They reverently\r\nlaid out the corpse--Wilson fetching his only spare shirt to array\r\nit in.  The wife still lay hidden in the clothes, in a stupor of\r\nagony.\r\n\r\nThere was a knock at the door, and Barton went to open it.  It was\r\nMary, who had received a message from her father, through a\r\nneighbour, telling her where he was; and she had set out early to\r\ncome and have a word with him before her day\'s work; but some\r\nerrands she had to do for Miss Simmonds had detained her until now.\r\n\r\n"Come in, wench!" said her father.  "Try if thou canst comfort yon\r\npoor, poor woman, kneeling down there.  God help her!"\r\n\r\nMary did not know what to say, or how to comfort; but she knelt down\r\nby her, and put her arm round her neck, and in a little while fell\r\nto crying herself so bitterly that the source of tears was opened by\r\nsympathy in the widow, and her full heart was, for a time, relieved.\r\n\r\nAnd Mary forgot all purposed meeting with her gay lover, Harry\r\nCarson; forgot Miss Simmonds\' errands, and her anger, in the anxious\r\ndesire to comfort the poor lone woman.  Never had her sweet face\r\nlooked more angelic, never had her gentle voice seemed so musical as\r\nwhen she murmured her broken sentences of comfort.\r\n\r\n"Oh, don\'t cry so, dear Mrs. Davenport, pray don\'t take on so.  Sure\r\nhe\'s gone where he\'ll never know care again.  Yes, I know how\r\nlonesome you must feel; but think of your children.  Oh! we\'ll all\r\nhelp to earn food for \'em.  Think how sorry HE\'D be, if he sees you\r\nfretting so.  Don\'t cry so, please don\'t."\r\n\r\nAnd she ended by crying herself as passionately as the poor widow.\r\n\r\nIt was agreed the town must bury him; he had paid to a burial club\r\nas long as he could, but by a few weeks\' omission, he had forfeited\r\nhis claim to a sum of money now.  Would Mrs. Davenport and the\r\nlittle child go home with Mary?  The latter brightened up as she\r\nurged this plan; but no! where the poor, fondly loved remains were,\r\nthere would the mourner be; and all that they could do was to make\r\nher as comfortable as their funds would allow, and to beg a\r\nneighbour to look in and say a word at times.  So she was left alone\r\nwith her dead, and they went to work that had work, and he who had\r\nnone, took upon him the arrangements for the funeral.\r\n\r\nMary had many a scolding from Miss Simmonds that day for her absence\r\nof mind.  To be sure Miss Simmonds was much put out by Mary\'s\r\nnon-appearance in the morning with certain bits of muslin, and\r\nshades of silk which were wanted to complete a dress to be worn that\r\nnight; but it was true enough that Mary did not mind what she was\r\nabout; she was too busy planning how her old black gown (her best\r\nwhen her mother died) might be sponged, and turned, and lengthened\r\ninto something like decent mourning for the widow.  And when she\r\nwent home at night (though it was very late, as a sort of\r\nretribution for her morning\'s negligence), she set to work at once,\r\nand was so busy and so glad over her task, that she had, every now\r\nand then, to check herself in singing merry ditties, which she felt\r\nlittle accorded with the sewing on which she was engaged.\r\n\r\nSo when the funeral day came, Mrs. Davenport was neatly arrayed in\r\nblack, a satisfaction to her poor heart in the midst of her sorrow.\r\nBarton and Wilson both accompanied her, as she led her two elder\r\nboys, and followed the coffin.  It was a simple walking funeral,\r\nwith nothing to grate on the feelings of any; far more in accordance\r\nwith its purpose, to my mind, than the gorgeous hearses, and nodding\r\nplumes, which form the grotesque funeral pomp of respectable people.\r\nThere was no "rattling the bones over the stones," of the pauper\'s\r\nfuneral.  Decently and quietly was he followed to the grave by one\r\ndetermined to endure her woe meekly for his sake.  The only mark of\r\npauperism attendant on the burial concerned the living and joyous,\r\nfar more than the dead, or the sorrowful.  When they arrived in the\r\nchurchyard, they halted before a raised and handsome tombstone; in\r\nreality a wooden mockery of stone respectabilities which adorned the\r\nburial-ground.  It was easily raised in a very few minutes, and\r\nbelow was the grave in which pauper bodies were piled until within a\r\nfoot or two of the surface; when the soil was shovelled over, and\r\nstamped down, and the wooden cover went to do temporary duty over\r\nanother hole.*  But little recked they of this who now gave up their\r\ndead.\r\n\r\n     *The case, to my certain knowledge, in one churchyard in\r\n      Manchester. There may be more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.   JEM WILSON\'S REPULSE.\r\n\r\n     "How infinite the wealth of love and hope\r\n      Garnered in these same tiny treasure-houses\r\n      And oh! what bankrupts in the world we feel,\r\n      When Death, like some remorseless creditor,\r\n      Seizes on all we fondly thought our own."\r\n                                       --"THE TWINS."\r\n\r\nThe ghoul-like fever was not to be braved with impunity, and balked\r\nof its prey.  The widow had reclaimed her children; her neighbours,\r\nin the good-Samaritan sense of the word, had paid her little arrears\r\nof rent, and made her a few shillings beforehand with the world.\r\nShe determined to flit from that cellar to another less full of\r\npainful associations, less haunted by mournful memories.  The Board,\r\nnot so formidable as she had imagined, had inquired into her case;\r\nand, instead of sending her to Stoke Claypole, her husband\'s\r\nBuckinghamshire parish, as she had dreaded, had agreed to pay her\r\nrent.  So food for four mouths was all she was now required to find;\r\nonly for three she would have said; for herself and the unweaned\r\nchild were but reckoned as one in her calculation.\r\n\r\nShe had a strong heart, now her bodily strength had been recruited\r\nby a week or two of food, and she would not despair.  So she took in\r\nsome little children to nurse, who brought their daily food with\r\nthem, which she cooked for them, without wronging their helplessness\r\nof a crumb; and when she had restored them to their mothers at\r\nnight, she set to work at plain sewing, "seam, and gusset, and\r\nband," and sat thinking how she might best cheat the factory\r\ninspector, and persuade him that her strong, big, hungry Ben was\r\nabove thirteen.  Her plan of living was so far arranged, when she\r\nheard, with keen sorrow, that Wilson\'s twin lads were ill of the\r\nfever.\r\n\r\nThey had never been strong.  They were like many a pair of twins,\r\nand seemed to have but one life divided between them.  One life, one\r\nstrength, and in this instance, I might almost say, one brain, for\r\nthey were helpless, gentle, silly children, but not the less dear to\r\ntheir parents and to their strong, active, manly, elder brother.\r\nThey were late on their feet, late in talking, late every way; had\r\nto be nursed and cared for when other lads of their age were\r\ntumbling about in the street, and losing themselves, and being taken\r\nto the police-office miles away from home.\r\n\r\nStill want had never yet come in at the door to make love for these\r\ninnocents fly out of the window.  Nor was this the case even now,\r\nwhen Jem Wilson\'s earnings, and his mother\'s occasional charings,\r\nwere barely sufficient to give all the family their fill of food.\r\n\r\nBut when the twins, after ailing many days, and caring little for\r\ntheir meat, fell sick on the same afternoon, with the same heavy\r\nstupor of suffering, the three hearts that loved them so, each felt,\r\nthough none acknowledged to the other, that they had little chance\r\nfor life.  It was nearly a week before the tale of their illness\r\nspread as far as the court where the Wilsons had once dwelt, and the\r\nBartons yet lived.\r\n\r\nAlice had heard of the sickness of her little nephews several days\r\nbefore, and had locked her cellar door, and gone off straight to her\r\nbrother\'s house, in Ancoats; but she was often absent for days, sent\r\nfor, as her neighbours knew, to help in some sudden emergency of\r\nillness or distress, so that occasioned no surprise.\r\n\r\nMargaret met Jem Wilson several days after his brothers were\r\nseriously ill, and heard from him the state of things at his home.\r\nShe told Mary of it as she entered the court late that evening; and\r\nMary listened with saddened heart to the strange contrast which such\r\nwoeful tidings presented to the gay and loving words she had been\r\nhearing on her walk home.  She blamed herself for being so much\r\ntaken up with visions of the golden future that she had lately gone\r\nbut seldom on Sunday afternoons, or other leisure time, to see Mrs.\r\nWilson, her mother\'s friend; and with hasty purpose of amendment she\r\nonly stayed to leave a message for her father with the next-door\r\nneighbour, and then went off at a brisk pace on her way to the house\r\nof mourning.\r\n\r\nShe stopped with her hand on the latch of the Wilsons\' door, to\r\nstill her beating heart, and listened to the hushed quiet within.\r\nShe opened the door softly; there sat Mrs. Wilson in the old\r\nrocking-chair, with one sick death-like boy lying on her knee,\r\ncrying without let or pause, but softly, gently, as fearing to\r\ndisturb the troubled, gasping child; while behind her, old Alice let\r\nher fast-dropping tears fall down on the dead body of the other\r\ntwin, which she was laying out on a board placed on a sort of\r\nsofa-settee in a corner of the room.  Over the child, which yet\r\nbreathed, the father bent, watching anxiously for some ground of\r\nhope, where hope there was none.  Mary stepped slowly and lightly\r\nacross to Alice.\r\n\r\n"Ay, poor lad!  God has taken him early, Mary."\r\n\r\nMary could not speak, she did not know what to say; it was so much\r\nworse than she had expected.  At last she ventured to whisper--\r\n\r\n"Is there any chance for the other one, think you?"\r\n\r\nAlice shook her head, and told with a look that she believed there\r\nwas none.  She next endeavoured to lift the little body, and carry\r\nit to its old accustomed bed in its parents\' room.  But earnest as\r\nthe father was in watching the yet-living, he had eyes and ears for\r\nall that concerned the dead, and sprang gently up, and took his dead\r\nson on his hard couch in his arms with tender strength, and carried\r\nhim upstairs as if afraid of wakening him.\r\n\r\nThe other child gasped louder, longer, with more of effort.\r\n\r\n"We mun get him away from his mother.  He cannot die while she\'s\r\nwishing him."\r\n\r\n"Wishing him?" said Mary, in a tone of inquiry.\r\n\r\n"Ay; donno\' ye know what \'wishing\' means?  There\'s none can die in\r\nthe arms of those who are wishing them sore to stay on earth.  The\r\nsoul o\' them as holds them won\'t let the dying soul go free; so it\r\nhas a hard struggle for the quiet of death.  We mun get him away\r\nfra\' his mother, or he\'ll have a hard death, poor lile* fellow."\r\n\r\n     *"Lile," a north-country word for "little."\r\n             "Wit leil labour to live."--Piers Plowman.\r\n\r\nSo without circumlocution she went and offered to take the sinking\r\nchild.  But the mother would not let him go, and looking in Alice\'s\r\nface with brimming and imploring eyes, declared, in earnest\r\nwhispers, that she was not wishing him, that she would fain have him\r\nreleased from his suffering.  Alice and Mary stood by with eyes\r\nfixed on the poor child, whose struggles seemed to increase, till at\r\nlast his mother said, with a choking voice--\r\n\r\n"May happen* yo\'d better take him, Alice; I believe my heart\'s\r\nwishing him a\' this while, for I cannot, no, I cannot bring mysel to\r\nlet my two childer go in one day; I cannot help longing to keep him,\r\nand yet he shan\'t suffer longer for me."\r\n\r\n     *"May happen," perhaps.\r\n\r\nShe bent down, and fondly, oh! with what passionate fondness, kissed\r\nher child, and then gave him up to Alice, who took him with tender\r\ncare.  Nature\'s struggles were soon exhausted, and he breathed his\r\nlittle life away in peace.\r\n\r\nThen the mother lifted up her voice and wept.  Her cries brought her\r\nhusband down to try with his aching heart to comfort hers.  Again\r\nAlice laid out the dead, Mary helping with reverent fear.  The\r\nfather and mother carried him upstairs to the bed, where his little\r\nbrother lay in calm repose.\r\n\r\nMary and Alice drew near the fire, and stood in quiet sorrow for\r\nsome time.  Then Alice broke the silence by saying--\r\n\r\n"It will be bad news for Jem, poor fellow, when he comes home."\r\n\r\n"Where is he?" asked Mary.\r\n\r\n"Working over-hours at th\' shop.  They\'n getten a large order fra\'\r\nforrin parts; and yo know, Jem mun work, though his heart\'s\r\nwell-nigh breaking for these poor laddies."\r\n\r\nAgain they were silent in thought, and again Alice spoke first.\r\n\r\n"I sometimes think the Lord is against planning.  Whene\'er I plan\r\novermuch, He is sure to send and mar all my plans, as if He would\r\nha\' me put the future into His hands.  Afore Christmas time I was as\r\nfull as full could be, of going home for good and all; yo han heard\r\nhow I\'ve wished it this terrible long time.  And a young lass from\r\nbehind Burton came into place in Manchester last Martinmas; so after\r\nawhile she had a Sunday out, and she comes to me, and tells me some\r\ncousins o\' mine bid her find me out, and say how glad they should be\r\nto ha\' me to bide wi\' \'em, and look after th\' childer, for they\'n\r\ngetten a big farm, and she\'s a deal to do among th\' cows.  So many\'s\r\na winter\'s night did I lie awake and think, that please God, come\r\nsummer, I\'d bid George and his wife goodbye, and go home at last.\r\nLittle did I think how God Almighty would balk me, for not leaving\r\nmy days in His hands, who had led me through the wilderness\r\nhitherto.  Here\'s George out of work, and more cast down than ever I\r\nseed him; wanting every chip o\' comfort he can get, e\'en afore this\r\nlast heavy stroke; and now I\'m thinking the Lord\'s finger points\r\nvery clear to my fit abiding-place; and I\'m sure if George and Jane\r\ncan say \'His will be done,\' it\'s no more than what I\'m beholden to\r\ndo."\r\n\r\nSo saying, she fell to tidying the room, removing as much as she\r\ncould every vestige of sickness; making up the fire, and setting on\r\nthe kettle for a cup of tea for her sister-in-law, whose low moans\r\nand sobs were occasionally heard in the room below.\r\n\r\nMary helped her in all these little offices.  They were busy in this\r\nway when the door was softly opened, and Jem came in, all grimed and\r\ndirty from his night-work, his soiled apron wrapped round his\r\nmiddle, in guise and apparel in which he would have been sorry at\r\nanother time to have been seen by Mary.  But just now he hardly saw\r\nher; he went straight up to Alice, and asked how the little chaps\r\nwere.  They had been a shade better at dinner-time; and he had been\r\nworking away through the long afternoon, and far into the night, in\r\nthe belief that they had taken the turn.  He had stolen out during\r\nthe half-hour allowed at the works for tea, to buy them an orange or\r\ntwo, which now puffed out his jacket-pocket.\r\n\r\nHe would make his aunt speak: he would not understand her shake of\r\nthe head and fast coursing tears.\r\n\r\n"They\'re both gone," said she.\r\n\r\n"Dead!"\r\n\r\n"Ay! poor fellows.  They took worse about two o\'clock.  Joe went\r\nfirst, as easy as a lamb, and Will died harder like."\r\n\r\n"Both!"\r\n\r\n"Ay, lad! both.  The Lord has ta\'en them from some evil to come, or\r\nHe would na\' ha\' made choice o\' them.  Ye may rest sure o\' that."\r\n\r\nJem went to the cupboard, and quietly extricated from his pocket the\r\noranges he had bought.  But he stayed long there, and at last his\r\nsturdy frame shook with his strong agony.  The two women were\r\nfrightened, as women always are, on witnessing a man\'s overpowering\r\ngrief.  They cried afresh in company.  Mary\'s heart melted within\r\nher as she witnessed Jem\'s sorrow, and she stepped gently up to the\r\ncorner where he stood, with his back turned to them, and putting her\r\nhand softly on his arm, said--\r\n\r\n"O Jem, don\'t give way so; I cannot bear to see you."\r\n\r\nJem felt a strange leap of joy in his heart, and knew the power she\r\nhad of comforting him.  He did not speak, as though fearing to\r\ndestroy by sound or motion the happiness of that moment, when her\r\nsoft hand\'s touch thrilled through his frame, and her silvery voice\r\nwas whispering tenderness in his ear.  Yes! it might be very wrong;\r\nhe could almost hate himself for it; with death and woe so\r\nsurrounding him, it yet was happiness, was bliss, to be so spoken to\r\nby Mary.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t, Jem, please don\'t," whispered she again, believing that his\r\nsilence was only another form of grief.\r\n\r\nHe could not contain himself.  He took her hand in his firm yet\r\ntrembling grasp, and said, in tones that instantly produced a\r\nrevulsion in her mood--\r\n\r\n"Mary, I almost loathe myself when I feel I would not give up this\r\nminute, when my brothers lie dead, and father and mother are in such\r\ntrouble, for all my life that\'s past and gone.  And, Mary," (as she\r\ntried to release her hand), "you know what makes me feel so\r\nblessed."\r\n\r\nShe did know--he was right there.  But as he turned to catch a look\r\nat her sweet face, he saw that it expressed unfeigned distress,\r\nalmost amounting to vexation; a dread of him, that he thought was\r\nalmost repugnance.\r\n\r\nHe let her hand go, and she quickly went away to Alice\'s side.\r\n\r\n"Fool that I was--nay, wretch that I was--to let myself take this\r\ntime of trouble to tell her how I loved her; no wonder that she\r\nturns away from such a selfish beast."\r\n\r\nPartly to relieve her from his presence, and partly from natural\r\ndesire, and partly, perhaps, from a penitent wish to share to the\r\nutmost his parents\' sorrow, he soon went upstairs to the chamber of\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nMary mechanically helped Alice in all the duties she performed\r\nthrough the remainder of that long night, but she did not see Jem\r\nagain.  He remained upstairs until after the early dawn showed Mary\r\nthat she need have no fear of going home through the deserted and\r\nquiet streets, to try and get a little sleep before work-hour.  So\r\nleaving kind messages to George and Jane Wilson, and hesitating\r\nwhether she might dare to send a few kind words to Jem, and deciding\r\nthat she had better not, she stepped out into the bright morning\r\nlight, so fresh a contrast to the darkened room where death had\r\nbeen.\r\n\r\n                                      "They had\r\n                      Another morn than ours."\r\n\r\nMary lay down on her bed in her clothes; and whether it was this, or\r\nthe broad day-light that poured in through the sky window, or\r\nwhether it was over-excitement, it was long before she could catch a\r\nwink of sleep.  Her thoughts ran on Jem\'s manner and words; not but\r\nwhat she had known the tale they told for many a day; but still she\r\nwished he had not put it so plainly.\r\n\r\n"O dear," said she to herself, "I wish he would not mistake me so; I\r\nnever dare to speak a common word o\' kindness, but his eye brightens\r\nand his cheek flushes.  It\'s very hard on me; for father and George\r\nWilson are old friends; and Jem and I ha\' known each other since we\r\nwere quite children.  I cannot think what possesses me, that I must\r\nalways be wanting to comfort him when he\'s downcast, and that I must\r\ngo meddling wi\' him to-night, when sure enough it was his aunt\'s\r\nplace to speak to him.  I don\'t care for him, and yet, unless I\'m\r\nalways watching myself, I\'m speaking to him in a loving voice.  I\r\nthink I cannot go right, for I either check myself till I\'m\r\ndownright cross to him, or else I speak just natural, and that\'s too\r\nkind and tender by half.  And I\'m as good as engaged to be married\r\nto another; and another far handsomer than Jem; only I think I like\r\nJem\'s face best for all that; liking\'s liking, and there\'s no help\r\nfor it.  Well, when I\'m Mrs. Harry Carson, may happen I can put some\r\ngood fortune in Jem\'s way.  But will he thank me for it?  He\'s\r\nrather savage at times, that I can see, and perhaps kindness from\r\nme, when I\'m another\'s, will only go against the grain.  I\'ll not\r\nplague myself wi\' thinking any more about him, that I won\'t."\r\n\r\nSo she turned on her pillow, and fell asleep, and dreamt of what was\r\noften in her waking thoughts; of the day when she should ride from\r\nchurch in her carriage, with wedding-bells ringing, and take up her\r\nastonished father, and drive away from the old dim work-a-day court\r\nfor ever, to live in a grand house, where her father should have\r\nnewspapers, and pamphlets, and pipes, and meat dinners every\r\nday--and all day long if he liked.\r\n\r\nSuch thoughts mingled in her predilection for the handsome young Mr.\r\nCarson, who, unfettered by work-hours, let scarcely a day pass\r\nwithout contriving a meeting with the beautiful little milliner he\r\nhad first seen while lounging in a shop where his sisters were\r\nmaking some purchases, and afterwards never rested till he had\r\nfreely, though respectfully, made her acquaintance in her daily\r\nwalks.  He was, to use his own expression to himself, quite\r\ninfatuated by her, and was restless each day till the time came when\r\nhe had a chance, and, of late, more than a chance of meeting her.\r\nThere was something of keen practical shrewdness about her, which\r\ncontrasted very bewitchingly with the simple, foolish, unworldly\r\nideas she had picked up from the romances which Miss Simmonds\' young\r\nladies were in the habit of recommending to each other.\r\n\r\nYes! Mary was ambitious, and did not favour Mr. Carson the less\r\nbecause he was rich and a gentleman.  The old leaven, infused years\r\nago by her Aunt Esther, fermented in her little bosom, and perhaps\r\nall the more, for her father\'s aversion to the rich and the gentle.\r\nSuch is the contrariness of the human heart, from Eve downwards,\r\nthat we all, in our old Adam state, fancy things forbidden sweetest.\r\nSo Mary dwelt upon and enjoyed the idea of some day becoming a lady,\r\nand doing all the elegant nothings appertaining to ladyhood.  It was\r\na comfort to her, when scolded by Miss Simmonds, to think of the day\r\nwhen she would drive up to the door in her own carriage, to order\r\nher gowns from the hasty-tempered yet kind dressmaker.  It was a\r\npleasure to her to hear the general admiration of the two elder Miss\r\nCarsons, acknowledged beauties in ball-room and street, on horseback\r\nand on foot, and to think of the time when she should ride and walk\r\nwith them in loving sisterhood.  But the best of her plans, the\r\nholiest, that which in some measure redeemed the vanity of the rest,\r\nwere those relating to her father; her dear father, now oppressed\r\nwith care, and always a disheartened, gloomy person.  How she would\r\nsurround him with every comfort she could devise (of course, he was\r\nto live with them), till he should acknowledge riches to be very\r\npleasant things, and bless his lady-daughter!  Every one who had\r\nshown her kindness in her low estate should then be repaid a\r\nhundredfold.\r\n\r\nSuch were the castles in air, the Alnaschar-visions in which Mary\r\nindulged, and which she was doomed in after days to expiate with\r\nmany tears.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, her words--or, even more, her tones--would maintain their\r\nhold on Jem Wilson\'s memory.  A thrill would yet come over him when\r\nhe remembered how her hand had rested on his arm.  The thought of\r\nher mingled with all his grief, and it was profound, for the loss of\r\nhis brothers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.   MARGARET\'S DEBUT AS A PUBLIC SINGER.\r\n\r\n"Deal gently with them, they have much endured;\r\n Scoff not at their fond hopes and earnest plans,\r\n Though they may seem to thee wild dreams and fancies.\r\n Perchance, in the rough school of stern Experience,\r\n They\'ve something learned which Theory does not teach;\r\n Or if they greatly err, deal gently still,\r\n And let their error but the stronger plead,\r\n \'Give us the light and guidance that we need!\'"\r\n                                    --LOVE THOUGHTS.\r\n\r\nOne Sunday afternoon, about three weeks after that mournful night,\r\nJem Wilson set out with the ostensible purpose of calling on John\r\nBarton.  He was dressed in his best--his Sunday suit of course;\r\nwhile his face glittered with the scrubbing he had bestowed on it.\r\nHis dark black hair had been arranged and rearranged before the\r\nhousehold looking-glass, and in his button-hole he stuck a narcissus\r\n(a sweet Nancy is its pretty Lancashire name), hoping it would\r\nattract Mary\'s notice, so that he might have the delight of giving\r\nit her.\r\n\r\nIt was a bad beginning of his visit of happiness that Mary saw him\r\nsome minutes before he came into her father\'s house.  She was\r\nsitting at the end of the dresser, with the little window-blind\r\ndrawn on one side, in order that she might see the passers-by, in\r\nthe intervals of reading her Bible, which lay open before her.  So\r\nshe watched all the greeting a friend gave Jem; she saw the face of\r\ncondolence, the sympathetic shake of the hand, and had time to\r\narrange her own face and manner before Jem came in, which he did, as\r\nif he had eyes for no one but her father, who sat smoking his pipe\r\nby the fire, while he read an old Northern Star, borrowed from a\r\nneighbouring public-house.\r\n\r\nThen he turned to Mary, who, he felt through the sure instinct of\r\nlove, by which almost his body thought, was present.  Her hands were\r\nbusy adjusting her dress; a forced and unnecessary movement Jem\r\ncould not help thinking.  Her accost was quiet and friendly, if\r\ngrave; she felt that she reddened like a rose, and wished she could\r\nprevent it, while Jem wondered if her blushes arose from fear, or\r\nanger, or love.\r\n\r\nShe was very cunning, I am afraid.  She pretended to read\r\ndiligently, and not to listen to a word that was said, while in fact\r\nshe heard all sounds, even to Jem\'s long, deep sighs, which wrung\r\nher heart.  At last she took up her Bible, and as if their\r\nconversation disturbed her, went upstairs to her little room.  And\r\nshe had scarcely spoken a word to Jem; scarcely looked at him; never\r\nnoticed his beautiful sweet Nancy, which only awaited her least word\r\nof praise to be hers!  He did not know--that pang was spared--that\r\nin her little dingy bedroom stood a white jug, filled with a\r\nluxuriant bunch of early spring roses, making the whole room\r\nfragrant and bright.  They were the gift of her richer lover.  So\r\nJem had to go on sitting with John Barton, fairly caught in his own\r\ntrap, and had to listen to his talk, and answer him as best he\r\nmight.\r\n\r\n"There\'s the right stuff in this here Star, and no mistake.  Such a\r\nright-down piece for short hours."\r\n\r\n"At the same rate of wages as now?" asked Jem.\r\n\r\n"Aye, aye! else where\'s the use?  It\'s only taking out o\' the\r\nmasters\' pocket what they can well afford.  Did I ever tell yo what\r\nth\' Infirmary chap let me into, many a year agone?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Jem listlessly.\r\n\r\n"Well! yo must know I were in th\' Infirmary for a fever, and times\r\nwere rare and bad, and there be good chaps there to a man while he\'s\r\nwick,* whate\'er they may be about cutting him up at after.**  So\r\nwhen I were better o\' th\' fever, but weak as water, they says to me,\r\nsays they, \'If yo can write, you may stay in a week longer, and help\r\nour surgeon wi\' sorting his papers; and we\'ll take care yo\'ve your\r\nbellyful of meat and drink.  Yo\'ll be twice as strong in a week.\'\r\nSo there wanted but one word to that bargain.  So I were set to\r\nwriting and copying; th\' writing I could do well enough, but they\'d\r\nsuch queer ways o\' spelling, that I\'d ne\'er been used to, that I\'d\r\nto look first at th\' copy and then at my letters, for all the world\r\nlike a cock picking up grains o\' corn.  But one thing startled me\r\ne\'en then, and I thought I\'d make bold to ask the surgeon the\r\nmeaning o\'t.  I\'ve getten no head for numbers, but this I know, that\r\nby FAR TH\' GREATER PART O\' THE ACCIDENTS AS COMED IN, HAPPENED IN\r\nTH\' LAST TWO HOURS O\' WORK, when folk getten tired and careless.\r\nTh\' surgeon said it were all true, and that he were going to bring\r\nthat fact to light."\r\n\r\n     *Wick; alive. Anglo-Saxon, cwic. "The QUICK and the dead."\r\n                            --Book of Common Prayer.\r\n    **At after; "AT AFTER souper goth this noble king."\r\n                            --CHAUCER, The Squire\'s Tale.\r\n\r\nJem was pondering Mary\'s conduct; but the pause made him aware he\r\nought to utter some civil listening noise; so he said--\r\n\r\n"Very true."\r\n\r\n"Ay, it\'s true enough, my lad, that we\'re sadly over-borne, and\r\nworse will come of it afore long.  Block-printers is going to\r\nstrike; they\'n getten a bang-up Union, as won\'t let \'em be put upon.\r\nBut there\'s many a thing will happen afore long, as folk don\'t\r\nexpect.  Yo may take my word for that, Jem."\r\n\r\nJem was very willing to take it, but did not express the curiosity\r\nhe should have done.  So John Barton thought he\'d try another hint\r\nor two.\r\n\r\n"Working folk won\'t be ground to the dust much longer.  We\'n a\' had\r\nas much to bear as human nature can bear.  So, if th\' masters can\'t\r\ndo us no good, and they say they can\'t, we mun try higher folk."\r\n\r\nStill Jem was not curious.  He gave up hope of seeing Mary again by\r\nher own good free-will; and the next best thing would be, to be\r\nalone to think of her.  So muttering something which he meant to\r\nserve as an excuse for his sudden departure, he hastily wished John\r\ngood-afternoon, and left him to resume his pipe and his politics.\r\n\r\nFor three years past trade had been getting worse and worse, and the\r\nprice of provisions higher and higher.  This disparity between the\r\namount of the earnings of the working classes and the price of their\r\nfood, occasioned, in more cases than could well be imagined, disease\r\nand death.  Whole families went through a gradual starvation.  They\r\nonly wanted a Dante to record their sufferings.  And yet even his\r\nwords would fall short of the awful truth; they could only present\r\nan outline of the tremendous facts of the destitution that\r\nsurrounded thousands upon thousands in the terrible years 1839,\r\n1840, and 1841.  Even philanthropists who had studied the subject,\r\nwere forced to own themselves perplexed in their endeavour to\r\nascertain the real causes of the misery; the whole matter was of so\r\ncomplicated a nature, that it became next to impossible to\r\nunderstand it thoroughly.  It need excite no surprise, then, to\r\nlearn that a bad feeling between working-men and the upper classes\r\nbecame very strong in this season of privation.  The indigence and\r\nsufferings of the operatives induced a suspicion in the minds of\r\nmany of them, that their legislators, their magistrates, their\r\nemployers, and even the ministers of religion, were, in general,\r\ntheir oppressors and enemies; and were in league for their\r\nprostration and enthralment.  The most deplorable and enduring evil\r\nthat arose out of the period of commercial depression to which I\r\nrefer, was this feeling of alienation between the different classes\r\nof society.  It is so impossible to describe, or even faintly to\r\npicture, the state of distress which prevailed in the town at that\r\ntime, that I will not attempt it; and yet I think again that surely,\r\nin a Christian land, it was not known even so feebly as words could\r\ntell it, or the more happy and fortunate would have thronged with\r\ntheir sympathy and their aid.  In many instances the sufferers wept\r\nfirst, and then they cursed.  Their vindictive feelings exhibited\r\nthemselves in rabid politics.  And when I hear, as I have heard, of\r\nthe sufferings and privations of the poor, of provision shops where\r\nha\'porths of tea, sugar, butter, and even flour, were sold to\r\naccommodate the indigent--of parents sitting in their clothes by the\r\nfireside during the whole night, for seven weeks together, in order\r\nthat their only bed and bedding might be reserved for the use of\r\ntheir large family--of others sleeping upon the cold hearthstone for\r\nweeks in succession, without adequate means of providing themselves\r\nwith food or fuel (and this in the depth of winter)--of others being\r\ncompelled to fast for days together, uncheered by any hope of better\r\nfortune, living, moreover, or rather starving, in a crowded garret,\r\nor damp cellar, and gradually sinking under the pressure of want and\r\ndespair into a premature grave; and when this has been confirmed by\r\nthe evidence of their careworn looks, their excited feelings, and\r\ntheir desolate homes--can I wonder that many of them, in such times\r\nof misery and destitution, spoke and acted with ferocious\r\nprecipitation?\r\n\r\nAn idea was now springing up among the operatives, that originated\r\nwith the Chartists, but which came at last to be cherished as a\r\ndarling child by many and many a one.  They could not believe that\r\nGovernment knew of their misery; they rather chose to think it\r\npossible that men could voluntarily assume the office of legislators\r\nfor a nation who were ignorant of its real state; as who should make\r\ndomestic rules for the pretty behaviour of children without caring\r\nto know that those children had been kept for days without food.\r\nBesides, the starving multitudes had heard, that the very existence\r\nof their distress had been denied in Parliament; and though they\r\nfelt this strange and inexplicable, yet the idea that their misery\r\nhad still to be revealed in all its depths, and that then some\r\nremedy would be found, soothed their aching hearts, and kept down\r\ntheir rising fury.\r\n\r\nSo a petition was framed, and signed by thousands in the bright\r\nspring days of 1839, imploring Parliament to hear witnesses who\r\ncould testify to the unparalleled destitution of the manufacturing\r\ndistricts.  Nottingham, Sheffield, Glasgow, Manchester, and many\r\nother towns, were busy appointing delegates to convey this petition,\r\nwho might speak, not merely of what they had seen, and had heard,\r\nbut from what they had borne and suffered.  Life-worn, gaunt,\r\nanxious, hunger-stamped men, were those delegates.\r\n\r\nOne of them was John Barton.  He would have been ashamed to own the\r\nflutter of spirits his appointment gave him.  There was the childish\r\ndelight of seeing London--that went a little way, and but a little\r\nway.  There was the vain idea of speaking out his notions before so\r\nmany grand folk--that went a little further; and last, there was the\r\nreally pure gladness of heart arising from the idea that he was one\r\nof those chosen to be instruments in making known the distresses of\r\nthe people, and consequently in procuring them some grand relief, by\r\nmeans of which they should never suffer want or care any more.  He\r\nhoped largely, but vaguely, of the results of his expedition.  An\r\nargosy of the precious hopes of many otherwise despairing creatures,\r\nwas that petition to be heard concerning their sufferings.\r\n\r\nThe night before the morning on which the Manchester delegates were\r\nto leave for London, Barton might be said to hold a levee, so many\r\nneighbours came dropping in.  Job Legh had early established himself\r\nand his pipe by John Barton\'s fire, not saying much, but puffing\r\naway, and imagining himself of use in adjusting the smoothing-irons\r\nthat hung before the fire, ready for Mary when she should want them.\r\nAs for Mary, her employment was the same as that of Beau Tibbs\'\r\nwife, "just washing her father\'s two shirts," in the pantry\r\nback-kitchen; for she was anxious about his appearance in London.\r\n(The coat had been redeemed, though the silk handkerchief was\r\nforfeited.)  The door stood open, as usual, between the house-place\r\nand back-kitchen, so she gave her greeting to their friends as they\r\nentered.\r\n\r\n"So, John, yo\'re bound for London, are yo?" said one.\r\n\r\n"Ay, I suppose I mun go," answered John, yielding to necessity as it\r\nwere.\r\n\r\n"Well, there\'s many a thing I\'d like yo to speak on to the\r\nParliament people.  Thou\'lt not spare \'em, John, I hope.  Tell \'em\r\nour minds: how we\'re thinking we\'n been clemmed long enough, and\r\nwe donnot see whatten good they\'n been doing, if they can\'t give us\r\nwhat we\'re all crying for sin\' the day we were born."\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay! I\'ll tell \'em that, and much more to it, when it gets to my\r\nturn; but thou knows there\'s many will have their word afore me."\r\n\r\n"Well, thou\'lt speak at last.  Bless thee, lad, do ask \'em to make\r\nth\' masters to break th\' machines.  There\'s never been good times\r\nsin\' spinning-jennies came up."\r\n\r\n"Machines is th\' ruin of poor folk," chimed in several voices.\r\n\r\n"For my part," said a shivering, half-clad man, who crept near the\r\nfire, as if ague-stricken, "I would like thee to tell \'em to pass\r\nth\' Short-hours Bill.  Flesh and blood gets wearied wi\' so much\r\nwork; why should factory hands work so much longer nor other trades?\r\nJust ask \'em that, Barton, will ye?"\r\n\r\nBarton was saved the necessity of answering, by the entrance of Mrs.\r\nDavenport, the poor widow he had been so kind to.  She looked\r\nhalf-fed, and eager, but was decently clad.  In her hand she brought\r\na little newspaper parcel, which she took to Mary, who opened it,\r\nand then called out, dangling a shirt collar from her soapy fingers--\r\n\r\n"See, father, what a dandy you\'ll be in London!  Mrs. Davenport has\r\nbrought you this; made new cut, all after the fashion.  Thank you\r\nfor thinking on him."\r\n\r\n"Eh, Mary!" said Mrs. Davenport in a low voice, "whatten\'s all I can\r\ndo, to what he\'s done for me and mine?  But, Mary, sure I can help\r\nye, for you\'ll be busy wi\' this journey."\r\n\r\n"Just help me wring these out, and then I\'ll take \'em to the\r\nmangle."\r\n\r\nSo Mrs. Davenport became a listener to the conversation; and after a\r\nwhile joined in.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure, John Barton, if yo are taking messages to the Parliament\r\nfolk, yo\'ll not object to telling \'em what a sore trial it is, this\r\nlaw o\' theirs, keeping childer fra\' factory work, whether they be\r\nweakly or strong.  There\'s our Ben; why, porridge seems to go no way\r\nwi\' him, he eats so much; and I han gotten no money to send him t\'\r\nschool, as I would like; and there he is, rampaging about the\r\nstreets a\' day, getting hungrier and hungrier, and picking up a\'\r\nmanner o\' bad ways; and th\' inspector won\'t let him in to work in\r\nth\' factory, because he\'s not right age; though he\'s twice as strong\r\nas Sankey\'s little ritling* of a lad, as works till he cries for his\r\nlegs aching so, though he is right age, and better."\r\n\r\n     *Ritling; probably a corruption of "ricketling," a child that\r\n      suffers from the rickets--a weakling.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve one plan I wish to tell John Barton," said a pompous,\r\ncareful-speaking man, "and I should like him for to lay it afore the\r\nHonourable House.  My mother comed out o\' Oxfordshire, and were\r\nunder-laundry-maid in Sir Francis Dashwood\'s family; and when we\r\nwere little ones, she\'d tell us stories of their grandeur: and one\r\nthing she named were, that Sir Francis wore two shirts a day.  Now\r\nhe were all as one as a Parliament man; and many on \'em, I han no\r\ndoubt, are like extravagant.  Just tell \'em, John, do, that they\'d\r\nbe doing the Lancashire weavers a great kindness, if they\'d ha\'\r\ntheir shirts a\' made o\' calico; \'t would make trade brisk, that\r\nwould, wi\' the power o\' shirts they wear."\r\n\r\nJob Legh now put in his word.  Taking the pipe out of his mouth, and\r\naddressing the last speaker, he said--\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell ye what, Bill, and no offence, mind ye; there\'s but\r\nhundreds of them Parliament folk as wear so many shirts to their\r\nback; but there\'s thousands and thousands o\' poor weavers as han\r\nonly gotten one shirt i\' the world; ay, and don\'t know where t\' get\r\nanother when that rag\'s done, though they\'re turning out miles o\'\r\ncalico every day; and many a mile o\'t is lying in warehouses,\r\nstopping up trade for want o\' purchasers.  Yo take my advice, John\r\nBarton, and ask Parliament to set trade free, so as workmen can earn\r\na decent wage, and buy their two, ay and three, shirts a year; that\r\nwould make weaving brisk."\r\n\r\nHe put his pipe in his mouth again, and redoubled his puffing, to\r\nmake up for lost time.\r\n\r\n"I\'m afeard, neighbours," said John Barton, "I\'ve not much chance o\'\r\ntelling \'em all yo say; what I think on, is just speaking out about\r\nthe distress that they say is nought.  When they hear o\' children\r\nborn on wet flags, without a rag t\' cover \'em or a bit o\' food for\r\nth\' mother; when they hear of folk lying down to die i\' th\' streets,\r\nor hiding their want i\' some hole o\' a cellar till death come to set\r\n\'em free; and when they hear o\' all this plague, pestilence, and\r\nfamine, they\'ll surely do somewhat wiser for us than we can guess at\r\nnow.  Howe\'er, I han no objection, if so be there\'s an opening, to\r\nspeak up for what yo say; anyhow, I\'ll do my best, and yo see now,\r\nif better times don\'t come after Parliament knows all."\r\n\r\nSome shook their heads, but more looked cheery: and then one by\r\none dropped off, leaving John and his daughter alone.\r\n\r\n"Didst thou mark how poorly Jane Wilson looked?" asked he, as they\r\nwound up their hard day\'s work by a supper eaten over the fire,\r\nwhich glowed and glimmered through the room, and formed their only\r\nlight.\r\n\r\n"No, I can\'t say as I did.  But she\'s never rightly held up her head\r\nsince the twins died; and all along she has never been a strong\r\nwoman."\r\n\r\n"Never sin\' her accident.  Afore that I mind her looking as fresh\r\nand likely a girl as e\'er a one in Manchester."\r\n\r\n"What accident, father?"\r\n\r\n"She cotched* her side again a wheel.  It were afore wheels were\r\nboxed up.  It were just when she were to have been married, and many\r\na one thought George would ha\' been off his bargain; but I knew he\r\nwern\'t the chap for that trick.  Pretty near the first place she\r\nwent to when she were able to go about again, was th\' Oud Church;\r\npoor wench, all pale and limping, she went up the aisle, George\r\nholding her up as tender as a mother, and walking as slow as e\'er he\r\ncould, not to hurry her, though there were plenty enow of rude lads\r\nto cast their jests at him and her.  Her face were white like a\r\nsheet when she came in church, but afore she got to th\' altar she\r\nwere all one flush.  But for a\' that it\'s been a happy marriage, and\r\nGeorge has stuck by me through life like a brother.  He\'ll never\r\nhold up his head again if he loses Jane.  I didn\'t like her looks\r\nto-night."\r\n\r\n     *Cotched; caught.\r\n\r\nAnd so he went to bed, the fear of forthcoming sorrow to his friend\r\nmingling with his thoughts of to-morrow, and his hopes for the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nMary watched him set off, with her hands over her eyes to shade them\r\nfrom the bright slanting rays of the morning sun, and then she\r\nturned into the house to arrange its disorder before going to her\r\nwork.  She wondered if she should like or dislike the evening and\r\nmorning solitude; for several hours when the clock struck she\r\nthought of her father, and wondered where he was; she made good\r\nresolutions according to her lights; and by-and-bye came the\r\ndistractions and events of the broad full day to occupy her with the\r\npresent, and to deaden the memory of the absent.\r\n\r\nOne of Mary\'s resolutions was, that she would not be persuaded or\r\ninduced to see Mr. Harry Carson during her father\'s absence.  There\r\nwas something crooked in her conscience after all; for this very\r\nresolution seemed an acknowledgment that it was wrong to meet him at\r\nany time; and yet she had brought herself to think her conduct quite\r\ninnocent and proper, for although unknown to her father, and\r\ncertain, even did he know it, to fail of obtaining his sanction, she\r\nesteemed her love-meetings with Mr. Carson as sure to end in her\r\nfathers good and happiness.  But now that he was away, she would do\r\nnothing that he would disapprove of; no, not even though it was for\r\nhis own good in the end.\r\n\r\nNow, amongst Miss Simmonds\' young ladies was one who had been from\r\nthe beginning a confidante in Mary\'s love affair, made so by Mr.\r\nCarson himself.  He had felt the necessity of some third person to\r\ncarry letters and messages, and to plead his cause when he was\r\nabsent.  In a girl named Sally Leadbitter he had found a willing\r\nadvocate.  She would have been willing to have embarked in a love\r\naffair herself (especially a clandestine one), for the mere\r\nexcitement of the thing; but her willingness was strengthened by\r\nsundry half-sovereigns, which from time to time Mr. Carson bestowed\r\nupon her.\r\n\r\nSally Leadbitter was vulgar-minded to the last degree; never easy\r\nunless her talk was of love and lovers; in her eyes it was an honour\r\nto have had a long list of wooers.  So constituted, it was a pity\r\nthat Sally herself was but a plain, red-haired, freckled girl; never\r\nlikely, one would have thought, to become a heroine on her own\r\naccount.  But what she lacked in beauty she tried to make up for by\r\na kind of witty boldness, which gave her what her betters would have\r\ncalled piquancy.  Considerations of modesty or propriety never\r\nchecked her utterance of a good thing.  She had just talent enough\r\nto corrupt others.  Her very good nature was an evil influence.\r\nThey could not hate one who was so kind; they could not avoid one\r\nwho was so willing to shield them from scrapes by any exertion of\r\nher own; whose ready fingers would at any time make up for their\r\ndeficiencies, and whose still more convenient tongue would at any\r\ntime invent for them.  The Jews, or Mohammedans (I forget which),\r\nbelieve that there is one little bone of our body,--one of the\r\nvertebrae, if I remember rightly,--which will never decay and turn\r\nto dust, but will lie incorrupt and indestructible in the ground\r\nuntil the Last Day: this is the Seed of the Soul.  The most\r\ndepraved have also their Seed of the Holiness that shall one day\r\novercome their evil; their one good quality, lurking hidden, but\r\nsafe, among all the corrupt and bad.\r\n\r\nSally\'s seed of the future soul was her love for her mother, an aged\r\nbedridden woman.  For her she had self-denial; for her, her good-\r\nnature rose into tenderness; to cheer her lonely bed, her spirits,\r\nin the evenings, when her body was often woefully tired, never\r\nflagged, but were ready to recount the events of the day, to turn\r\nthem into ridicule, and to mimic, with admirable fidelity, any\r\nperson gifted with an absurdity who had fallen under her keen eye.\r\nBut the mother was lightly principled like Sally herself; nor was\r\nthere need to conceal from her the reason why Mr. Carson gave her so\r\nmuch money.  She chuckled with pleasure, and only hoped that the\r\nwooing would be long a-doing.\r\n\r\nStill neither she, nor her daughter, nor Harry Carson liked this\r\nresolution of Mary, not to see him during her father\'s absence.\r\n\r\nOne evening (and the early summer evenings were long and bright\r\nnow), Sally met Mr. Carson by appointment, to be charged with a\r\nletter for Mary, imploring her to see him, which Sally was to back\r\nwith all her powers of persuasion.  After parting from him she\r\ndetermined, as it was not so very late, to go at once to Mary\'s, and\r\ndeliver the message and letter.\r\n\r\nShe found Mary in great sorrow.  She had just heard of George\r\nWilson\'s sudden death: her old friend, her father\'s friend, Jem\'s\r\nfather--all his claims came rushing upon her.  Though not guarded\r\nfrom unnecessary sight or sound of death, as the children of the\r\nrich are, yet it had so often been brought home to her this last\r\nthree or four months.  It was so terrible thus to see friend after\r\nfriend depart.  Her father, too, who had dreaded Jane Wilson\'s death\r\nthe evening before he set off.  And she, the weakly, was left\r\nbehind, while the strong man was taken.  At any rate the sorrow her\r\nfather had so feared for him was spared.  Such were the thoughts\r\nwhich came over her.\r\n\r\nShe could not go to comfort the bereaved, even if comfort were in\r\nher power to give; for she had resolved to avoid Jem; and she felt\r\nthat this of all others was not the occasion on which she could keep\r\nup a studiously cold manner.\r\n\r\nAnd in this shock of grief, Sally Leadbitter was the last person she\r\nwished to see.  However, she rose to welcome her, betraying her\r\ntear-swollen face.\r\n\r\n"Well, I shall tell Mr. Carson to-morrow how you\'re fretting for\r\nhim; it\'s no more nor he\'s doing for you, I can tell you."\r\n\r\n"For him, indeed!" said Mary, with a toss of her pretty head.\r\n\r\n"Ay, miss, for him!  You\'ve been sighing as if your heart would\r\nbreak now for several days, over your work; now arn\'t you a little\r\ngoose not to go and see one who I am sure loves you as his life, and\r\nwhom you love; \'How much, Mary?\'  \'This much,\' as the children say"\r\n(opening her arms very wide).\r\n\r\n"Nonsense," said Mary, pouting; "I often think I don\'t love him at\r\nall."\r\n\r\n"And I\'m to tell him that, am I, next time I see him?" asked Sally.\r\n\r\n"If you like," replied Mary.  "I\'m sure I don\'t care for that or\r\nanything else now"; weeping afresh.\r\n\r\nBut Sally did not like to be the bearer of any such news.  She saw\r\nshe had gone on the wrong tack, and that Mary\'s heart was too full\r\nto value either message or letter as she ought.  So she wisely\r\npaused in their delivery and said, in a more sympathetic tone than\r\nshe had hitherto used--\r\n\r\n"Do tell me, Mary, what\'s fretting you so?  You know I never could\r\nabide to see you cry."\r\n\r\n"George Wilson\'s dropped down dead this afternoon," said Mary,\r\nfixing her eyes for one minute on Sally, and the next hiding her\r\nface in her apron as she sobbed anew.\r\n\r\n"Dear, dear!  All flesh is grass; here to-day and gone tomorrow, as\r\nthe Bible says.  Still he was an old man, and not good for much;\r\nthere\'s better folk than him left behind.  Is th\' canting old maid\r\nas was his sister alive yet?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know who you mean," said Mary sharply; for she did know,\r\nand did not like to have her dear, simple Alice so spoken of.\r\n\r\n"Come, Mary, don\'t be so innocent.  Is Miss Alice Wilson alive,\r\nthen; will that please you?  I haven\'t seen her hereabouts lately."\r\n\r\n"No, she\'s left living here.  When the twins died, she thought she\r\ncould, maybe, be of use to her sister, who was sadly cast down, and\r\nAlice thought she could cheer her up; at any rate she could listen\r\nto her when her heart grew overburdened; so she gave up her cellar\r\nand went to live with them."\r\n\r\n"Well, good go with her.  I\'d no fancy for her, and I\'d no fancy for\r\nher making my pretty Mary into a Methodee."\r\n\r\n"She wasn\'t a Methodee; she was Church o\' England."\r\n\r\n"Well, well, Mary, you\'re very particular.  You know what I meant.\r\nLook, who is this letter from?" holding up Henry Carson\'s letter.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, and don\'t care," said Mary, turning very red.\r\n\r\n"My eye! as if I didn\'t know you did know and did care."\r\n\r\n"Well, give it me," said Mary impatiently, and anxious in her\r\npresent mood for her visitor\'s departure.\r\n\r\nSally relinquished it unwillingly.  She had, however, the pleasure\r\nof seeing Mary dimple and blush as she read the letter, which seemed\r\nto say the writer was not indifferent to her.\r\n\r\n"You must tell him I can\'t come," said Mary, raising her eyes at\r\nlast.  "I have said I won\'t meet him while father is away, and I\r\nwon\'t."\r\n\r\n"But, Mary, he does so look for you.  You\'d be quite sorry for him,\r\nhe\'s so put out about not seeing you.  Besides, you go when your\r\nfather\'s at home, without letting on* to him, and what harm would\r\nthere be in going now?"\r\n\r\n     *Letting on; informing.  In Anglo-Saxon one meaning of "laetan"\r\n      was "to admit," and we say "to let out the secret."\r\n\r\n"Well, Sally, you know my answer, I won\'t; and I won\'t."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell him to come and see you himself some evening, instead o\'\r\nsending me; he\'d maybe find you not so hard to deal with."\r\n\r\nMary flashed up.\r\n\r\n"If he dares to come here while father\'s away, I\'ll call the\r\nneighbours in to turn him out, so don\'t be putting him up to that."\r\n\r\n"Mercy on us! one would think you were the first girl that ever had\r\na lover; have you never heard what other girls do and think no shame\r\nof?"\r\n\r\n"Hush, Sally! that\'s Margaret Jennings at the door."\r\n\r\nAnd in an instant Margaret was in the room.  Mary had begged Job\r\nLegh to let her come and sleep with her.  In the uncertain firelight\r\nyou could not help noticing that she had the groping walk of a blind\r\nperson.\r\n\r\n"Well, I must go, Mary," said Sally.  "And that\'s your last word?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes; good-night."  She shut the door gladly on her unwelcome\r\nvisitor--unwelcome at that time at least.\r\n\r\n"O Margaret, have ye heard this sad news about George Wilson?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, that I have.  Poor creatures, they\'ve been so tried lately.\r\nNot that I think sudden death so bad a thing; it\'s easy, and there\'s\r\nno terrors for him as dies.  For them as survives it\'s very hard.\r\nPoor George! he were such a hearty-looking man."\r\n\r\n"Margaret," said Mary, who had been closely observing her friend,\r\n"thou\'rt very blind to-night, arn\'t thou?  Is it wi\' crying?  Your\r\neyes are so swollen and red."\r\n\r\n"Yes, dear! but not crying for sorrow.  Han ye heard where I was\r\nlast night?"\r\n\r\n"No; where?"\r\n\r\n"Look here."  She held up a bright golden sovereign.  Mary opened\r\nher large grey eyes with astonishment.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell you all and how about it.  You see there\'s a gentleman\r\nlecturing on music at th\' Mechanics\', and he wants folk to sing his\r\nsongs.  Well, last night the counter got a sore throat and couldn\'t\r\nmake a note.  So they sent for me.  Jacob Butterworth had said a\r\ngood word for me, and they asked me would I sing?  You may think I\r\nwas frightened, but I thought, Now or never, and said I\'d do my\r\nbest.  So I tried o\'er the songs wi\' th\' lecturer, and then th\'\r\nmanagers told me I were to make myself decent and be there by\r\nseven."\r\n\r\n"And what did you put on?" asked Mary.  "Oh, why didn\'t you come in\r\nfor my pretty pink gingham?"\r\n\r\n"I did think on\'t; but you had na come home then.  No! I put on my\r\nmerino, as was turned last winter, and my white shawl, and did my\r\nhair pretty tidy; it did well enough.  Well, but as I was saying, I\r\nwent at seven.  I couldn\'t see to read my music, but I took th\'\r\npaper in wi\' me, to ha\' something to do wi\' my fingers.  Th\' folks\'\r\nheads danced, as I stood as right afore \'em all as if I\'d been going\r\nto play at ball wi\' \'em.  You may guess I felt squeamish, but mine\r\nweren\'t the first song, and th\' music sounded like a friend\'s voice\r\ntelling me to take courage.  So, to make a long story short, when it\r\nwere all o\'er th\' lecturer thanked me, and th\' managers said as how\r\nthere never was a new singer so applauded (for they\'d clapped and\r\nstamped after I\'d done, till I began to wonder how many pair o\'\r\nshoes they\'d get through a week at that rate, let alone their\r\nhands).  So I\'m to sing again o\' Thursday; and I got a sovereign\r\nlast night, and am to have half-a-sovereign every night th\' lecturer\r\nis at th\' Mechanics\'."\r\n\r\n"Well, Margaret, I\'m right glad to hear it."\r\n\r\n"And I don\'t think you\'ve heard the best bit yet.  Now that a way\r\nseemed open to me, of not being a burden to any one, though it did\r\nplease God to make me blind, I thought I\'d tell grandfather.  I only\r\ntell\'d him about the singing and the sovereign last night, for I\r\nthought I\'d not send him to bed wi\' a heavy heart; but this morning\r\nI telled him all."\r\n\r\n"And how did he take it?"\r\n\r\n"He\'s not a man of many words; and it took him by surprise like."\r\n\r\n"I wonder at that; I\'ve noticed it in your ways ever since you\r\ntelled me."\r\n\r\n"Ay, that\'s it!  If I\'d not telled you, and you\'d seen me every day,\r\nyou\'d not ha\' noticed the little mite o\' difference fra\' day to\r\nday."\r\n\r\n"Well, but what did your grandfather say?"\r\n\r\n"Why, Mary," said Margaret, half smiling, "I\'m a bit loth to tell\r\nyo, for unless yo knew grandfather\'s ways like me, yo\'d think it\r\nstrange.  He was taken by surprise, and he said: \'Damn yo!\'  Then\r\nhe began looking at his book as it were, and were very quiet, while\r\nI telled him all about it; how I\'d feared, and how downcast I\'d\r\nbeen; and how I were now reconciled to it, if it were th\' Lord\'s\r\nwill; and how I hoped to earn money by singing; and while I were\r\ntalking, I saw great big tears come dropping on th\' book; but in\r\ncourse I never let on that I saw \'em.  Dear grandfather! and all day\r\nlong he\'s been quietly moving things out o\' my way, as he thought\r\nmight trip me up, and putting things in my way as he thought I might\r\nwant; never knowing I saw and felt what he were doing; for, yo see,\r\nhe thinks I\'m out and out blind, I guess--as I shall be soon."\r\n\r\nMargaret sighed in spite of her cheerful and relieved tone.\r\n\r\nThough Mary caught the sigh, she felt it was better to let it pass\r\nwithout notice, and began, with the tact which true sympathy rarely\r\nfails to supply, to ask a variety of questions respecting her\r\nfriend\'s musical debut, which tended to bring out more distinctly\r\nhow successful it had been.\r\n\r\n"Why, Margaret," at length she exclaimed, "thou\'lt become as famous,\r\nmaybe, as that grand lady fra\' London as we see\'d one night driving\r\nup to th\' concert-room door in her carriage."\r\n\r\n"It looks very like it," said Margaret, with a smile.  "And be sure,\r\nMary, I\'ll not forget to give thee a lift now and then when that\r\ncomes about.  Nay, who knows, if thou\'rt a good girl, but may-happen\r\nI may make thee my lady\'s maid!  Wouldn\'t that be nice?  So I e\'en\r\nsing to myself th\' beginning o\' one o\' my songs--\r\n\r\n      \'An\' ye shall walk in silk attire,\r\n       An\' siller hae to spare.\'"\r\n\r\n"Nay, don\'t stop; or else give me something rather more new, for\r\nsomehow I never quite liked that part about thinking o\' Donald\r\nmair?"\r\n\r\n"Well, though I\'m a bit tired I don\'t care if I do.  Before I come I\r\nwere practising well-nigh upon two hours this one which I\'m to sing\r\no\' Thursday.  The lecturer said he were sure it would just suit me,\r\nand I should do justice to it; and I should be right sorry to\r\ndisappoint him, he were so nice and encouraging like to me.  Eh!\r\nMary, what a pity there isn\'t more o\' that way, and less scolding\r\nand rating i\' th\' world!  It would go a vast deal further.  Beside,\r\nsome o\' th\' singers said, they were a\'most certain that it were a\r\nsong o\' his own, because he were so fidgety and particular about it,\r\nand so anxious I should give it th\' proper expression.  And that\r\nmakes me care still more.  Th\' first verse, he said, were to be sung\r\n\'tenderly, but joyously!\'  I\'m afraid I don\'t quite hit that, but\r\nI\'ll try.\r\n\r\n     \'What a single word can do!\r\n      Thrilling all the heart-strings through,\r\n      Calling forth fond memories,\r\n      Raining round hope\'s melodies,\r\n      Steeping all in one bright hue--\r\n      What a single word can do !\'\r\n\r\n"Now it falls into th\' minor key, and must be very sad-like.  I feel\r\nas if I could do that better than t\'other.\r\n\r\n     \'What a single word can do!\r\n      Making life seem all untrue,\r\n      Driving joy and hope away,\r\n      Leaving not one cheering ray,\r\n      Blighting every flower that grew--\r\n      What a single word can do!\'"\r\n\r\nMargaret certainly made the most of this little song.  As a factory\r\nworker, listening outside, observed, "She spun it reet* fine!"  And\r\nif she only sang it at the Mechanics\' with half the feeling she put\r\ninto it that night, the lecturer must have been hard to please if he\r\ndid not admit that his expectations were more than fulfilled.\r\n\r\nWhen it was ended, Mary\'s looks told more than words could have done\r\nwhat she thought of it; and partly to keep in a tear which would\r\nfain have rolled out, she brightened into a laugh, and said, "For\r\ncertain th\' carriage is coming.  So let us go and dream on it."\r\n\r\n     *Reet; right; often used for "very."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.   BARTON\'S LONDON EXPERIENCES.\r\n\r\n"A life of self-indulgence is for us,\r\n   A life of self-denial is for them;\r\n For us the streets, broad-built and populous,\r\n   For them unhealthy corners, garrets dim,\r\n   And cellars where the water-rat may swim!\r\n For us green paths refreshed by frequent rain,\r\n   For them dark alleys where the dust lies grim!\r\n Not doomed by us to this appointed pain--\r\n God made us rich and poor--of what do these complain?"\r\n                    --MRS. NORTON\'S Child of the Islands.\r\n\r\nThe next evening it was a warm, pattering, incessant rain--just the\r\nrain to waken up the flowers.  But in Manchester, where, alas! there\r\nare no flowers, the rain had only a disheartening and gloomy effect;\r\nthe streets were wet and dirty, the drippings from the houses were\r\nwet and dirty, and the people were wet and dirty.  Indeed, most kept\r\nwithin doors; and there was an unusual silence of footsteps in the\r\nlittle paved courts.\r\n\r\nMary had to change her clothes after her walk home; and had hardly\r\nsettled herself before she heard some one fumbling at the door.  The\r\nnoise continued long enough to allow her to get up, and go and open\r\nit.  There stood--could it be? yes it was, her father!\r\n\r\nDrenched and wayworn, there he stood!  He came in with no word to\r\nMary in return for her cheery and astonished greeting.  He sat down\r\nby the fire in his wet things, unheeding.  But Mary would not let\r\nhim so rest.  She ran up and brought down his working-day clothes,\r\nand went into the pantry to rummage up their little bit of provision\r\nwhile he changed by the fire, talking all the while as gaily as she\r\ncould, though her father\'s depression hung like lead on her heart.\r\n\r\nFor Mary, in her seclusion at Miss Simmonds\',--where the chief talk\r\nwas of fashions, and dress, and parties to be given, for which such\r\nand such gowns would be wanted, varied with a slight-whispered\r\ninterlude occasionally about love and lovers--had not heard the\r\npolitical news of the day; that Parliament had refused to listen to\r\nthe working-men, when they petitioned, with all the force of their\r\nrough, untutored words, to be heard concerning the distress which\r\nwas riding, like the Conqueror on his Pale Horse, among the people;\r\nwhich was crushing their lives out of them, and stamping woe-marks\r\nover the land.\r\n\r\nWhen he had eaten and was refreshed, they sat for some time in\r\nsilence; for Mary wished him to tell her what oppressed him so, yet\r\ndurst not ask.  In this she was wise; for when we are heavy-laden in\r\nour hearts it falls in better with our humour to reveal our case in\r\nour own way, and our own time.\r\n\r\nMary sat on a stool at her father\'s feet in old childish guise, and\r\nstole her hand into his, while his sadness infected her, and she\r\n"caught the trick of grief, and sighed," she knew not why.\r\n\r\n"Mary, we mun speak to our God to hear us, for man will not hearken;\r\nno, not now, when we weep tears o\' blood."\r\n\r\nIn an instant Mary understood the fact, if not the details, that so\r\nweighed down her father\'s heart.  She pressed his hand with silent\r\nsympathy.  She did not know what to say, and was so afraid of\r\nspeaking wrongly, that she was silent.  But when his attitude had\r\nremained unchanged for more than half-an-hour, his eyes gazing\r\nvacantly and fixedly at the fire, no sound but now and then a deep-\r\ndrawn sigh to break the weary ticking of the clock, and the\r\ndrip-drop from the roof without, Mary could bear it no longer.\r\nAnything to rouse her father.  Even bad news.\r\n\r\n"Father, do you know George Wilson\'s dead?"  (Her hand was suddenly\r\nand almost violently compressed.)  "He dropped down dead in Oxford\r\nRoad yester morning.  It\'s very sad, isn\'t it, father?"\r\n\r\nHer tears were ready to flow as she looked up in her father\'s face\r\nfor sympathy.  Still the same fixed look of despair, not varied by\r\ngrief for the dead.\r\n\r\n"Best for him to die," he said, in a low voice.\r\n\r\nThis was unbearable.  Mary got up under pretence of going to tell\r\nMargaret that she need not come to sleep with her to-night, but\r\nreally to ask Job Legh to come and cheer her father.\r\n\r\nShe stopped outside the door.  Margaret was practising her singing,\r\nand through the still night air her voice rang out, like that of an\r\nangel--\r\n\r\n     "Comfort ye, comfort ye, my people, saith your God."\r\n\r\nThe old Hebrew prophetic words fell like dew on Mary\'s heart.  She\r\ncould not interrupt.  She stood listening and "comforted," till the\r\nlittle buzz of conversation again began, and then entered and told\r\nher errand.\r\n\r\nBoth grandfather and grand-daughter rose instantly to fulfil her\r\nrequest.\r\n\r\n"He\'s just tired out, Mary," said old Job.  "He\'ll be a different\r\nman to-morrow."\r\n\r\nThere is no describing the looks and tones that have power over an\r\naching, heavy-laden heart; but in an hour or so John Barton was\r\ntalking away as freely as ever, though all his talk ran, as was\r\nnatural, on the disappointment of his fond hope, of the forlorn hope\r\nof many.\r\n\r\n"Ay, London\'s a fine place," said he, "and finer folk live in it\r\nthan I ever thought on, or ever heerd tell on except in th\'\r\nstorybooks.  They are having their good things now, that afterwards\r\nthey may be tormented."\r\n\r\nStill at the old parable of Dives and Lazarus!  Does it haunt the\r\nminds of the rich as it does those of the poor?\r\n\r\n"Do tell us all about London, dear father," asked Mary, who was\r\nsitting at her old post by her father\'s knee.\r\n\r\n"How can I tell yo a\' about it, when I never see\'d one-tenth of it.\r\nIt\'s as big as six Manchesters, they telled me.  One-sixth may be\r\nmade up o\' grand palaces, and three-sixths o\' middling kind, and th\'\r\nrest o\' holes o\' iniquity and filth, such as Manchester knows nought\r\non, I\'m glad to say."\r\n\r\n"Well, father, but did you see the Queen?"\r\n\r\n"I believe I didn\'t, though one day I thought I\'d seen her many a\r\ntime.  You see," said he, turning to Job Legh, "there were a day\r\nappointed for us to go to Parliament House.  We were most on us\r\nbiding at a public-house in Holborn, where they did very well for\r\nus.  Th\' morning of taking our petition we had such a spread for\r\nbreakfast as th\' Queen hersel might ha\' sitten down to.  I suppose\r\nthey thought we wanted putting in heart.  There were mutton kidneys,\r\nand sausages, and broiled ham, and fried beef and onions; more like\r\na dinner nor a breakfast.  Many on our chaps though, I could see,\r\ncould eat but little.  Th\' food stuck in their throats when they\r\nthought o\' them at home, wives and little ones, as had, maybe at\r\nthat very time, nought to eat.  Well, after breakfast, we were all\r\nset to walk in procession, and a time it took to put us in order,\r\ntwo and two, and the petition, as was yards long, carried by the\r\nforemost pairs.  The men looked grave enough, yo may be sure and\r\nsuch a set of thin, wan, wretched-looking chaps as they were!"\r\n\r\n"Yourself is none to boast on."\r\n\r\n"Ay, but I were fat and rosy to many a one.  Well, we walked on and\r\non through many a street, much the same as Deansgate.  We had to\r\nwalk slowly, slowly, for th\' carriages an\' cabs as thronged th\'\r\nstreets.  I thought by-and-bye we should maybe get clear on \'em, but\r\nas the streets grew wider they grew worse, and at last we were\r\nfairly blocked up at Oxford Street.  We getten across it after a\r\nwhile though, and my eyes! the grand streets we were in then!\r\nThey\'re sadly puzzled how to build houses though in London; there\'d\r\nbe an opening for a good steady master builder there, as know\'d his\r\nbusiness.  For yo see the houses are many on \'em built without any\r\nproper shape for a body to live in; some on \'em they\'ve after\r\nthought would fall down, so they\'ve stuck great ugly pillars out\r\nbefore \'em.  And some on \'em (we thought they must be th\' tailors\'\r\nsign) had getten stone men and women as wanted clothes stuck on \'em.\r\nI were like a child, I forgot a\' my errand in looking about me.  By\r\nthis it were dinner-time, or better, as we could tell by the sun,\r\nright above our heads, and we were dusty and tired, going a step now\r\nand a step then.  Well, at last we getten into a street grander nor\r\nall, leading to th\' Queen\'s palace, and there it were I thought I\r\nsaw th\' Queen.  Yo\'ve seen th\' hearses wi\' white plumes, Job?"\r\n\r\nJob assented.\r\n\r\n"Well, them undertaker folk are driving a pretty trade in London.\r\nWell-nigh every lady we saw in a carriage had hired one o\' them\r\nplumes for the day, and had it niddle noddling on her head.  It were\r\nthe Queen\'s Drawing-room, they said, and the carriages went bowling\r\nalong towards her house, some wi\' dressed-up gentlemen like circus\r\nfolk in \'em, and rucks* o\' ladies in others.  Carriages themselves\r\nwere great shakes too.  Some o\' the gentlemen as couldn\'t get inside\r\nhung on behind, wi\' nosegays to smell at, and sticks to keep off\r\nfolk as might splash their silk stockings.  I wonder why they didn\'t\r\nhire a cab rather than hang on like a whip-behind boy; but I suppose\r\nthey wished to keep wi\' their wives, Darby and Joan like.  Coachmen\r\nwere little squat men, wi\' wigs like the oud-fashioned parsons\'.\r\nWell, we could na get on for these carriages, though we waited and\r\nwaited.  Th\' horses were too fat to move quick; they never known\r\nwant o\' food, one might tell by their sleek coats; and police pushed\r\nus back when we tried to cross.  One or two of \'em struck wi\' their\r\nsticks, and coachmen laughed, and some officers as stood nigh put\r\ntheir spy-glasses in their eye, and left \'em sticking there like\r\nmountebanks.  One o\' th\' police struck me.  \'Whatten business have\r\nyou to do that?\' said I.\r\n\r\n     *Rucks; a great quantity.\r\n\r\n"\'You\'re frightening them horses,\' says he, in his mincing way (for\r\nLondoners are mostly all tongue-tied, and can\'t say their a\'s and\r\ni\'s properly, \'and it\'s our business to keep you from molesting the\r\nladies and gentlemen going to her Majesty\'s Drawing-room.\'\r\n\r\n"\'And why are we to be molested?\' asked I, \'going decently about our\r\nbusiness, which is life and death to us, and many a little one\r\nclemming at home in Lancashire?  Which business is of most\r\nconsequence i\' the sight o\' God, think yo, ourn or them grand ladies\r\nand gentlemen as yo think so much on?\'\r\n\r\n"But I might as well ha\' held my peace, for he only laughed."\r\n\r\nJohn ceased.  After waiting a little, to see if he would go on\r\nhimself, Job said--\r\n\r\n"Well, but that\'s not a\' your story, man.  Tell us what happened\r\nwhen you got to th\' Parliament House."\r\n\r\nAfter a little pause, John answered--\r\n\r\n"If you please, neighbour, I\'d rather say nought about that.  It\'s\r\nnot to be forgotten, or forgiven either, by me or many another; but\r\nI canna tell of our down-casting just as a piece of London news.  As\r\nlong as I live, our rejection of that day will abide in my heart;\r\nand as long as I live I shall curse them as so cruelly refused to\r\nhear us; but I\'ll not speak of it no* more."\r\n\r\n     *A similar use of a double negative is frequent in Chaucer;\r\n      as in the "Miller\'s Tale":\r\n         "That of no wife toke he non offering\r\n          For curtesie, he sayd, he n\'old non."\r\n\r\nSo, daunted in their inquiries, they sat silent for a few minutes.\r\n\r\nOld Job, however, felt that some one must speak, else all the good\r\nthey had done in dispelling John Barton\'s gloom was lost.  So after\r\na while he thought of a subject, neither sufficiently dissonant from\r\nthe last to jar on a full heart, nor too much the same to cherish\r\nthe continuance of the gloomy train of thought.\r\n\r\n"Did you ever hear tell," said he to Mary, "that I were in London\r\nonce?"\r\n\r\n"No!" said she with surprise, and looking at Job with increased\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\n"Ay, but I were though, and Peg there too, though she minds nought\r\nabout it, poor wench!  You must know I had but one child, and she\r\nwere Margaret\'s mother.  I loved her above a bit, and one day when\r\nshe came (standing behind me for that I should not see her blushes,\r\nand stroking my cheeks in her own coaxing way), and told me she and\r\nFrank Jennings (as was a joiner lodging near us) should be so happy\r\nif they were married, I could not find in my heart t\' say her nay,\r\nthough I went sick at the thought of losing her away from my home.\r\nHowever, she was my only child, and I never said nought of what I\r\nfelt, for fear o\' grieving her young heart.  But I tried to think o\'\r\nthe time when I\'d been young mysel, and had loved her blessed\r\nmother, and how we\'d left father and mother, and gone out into th\'\r\nworld together, and I\'m now right thankful I held my peace, and\r\ndidna fret her wi\' telling her how sore I was at parting wi\' her\r\nthat were the light o\' my eyes."\r\n\r\n"But," said Mary, "you said the young man were a neighbour."\r\n\r\n"Ay, so he were, and his father afore him.  But work were rather\r\nslack in Manchester, and Frank\'s uncle sent him word o\' London work\r\nand London wages, so he were to go there, and it were there Margaret\r\nwas to follow him.  Well, my heart aches yet at thought of those\r\ndays.  She so happy, and he so happy; only the poor father as\r\nfretted sadly behind their backs.  They were married and stayed some\r\ndays wi\' me afore setting off; and I\'ve often thought sin\',\r\nMargaret\'s heart failed her many a time those few days, and she\r\nwould fain ha\' spoken; but I knew fra\' mysel it were better to keep\r\nit pent up, and I never let on what I were feeling.  I knew what she\r\nmeant when she came kissing, and holding my hand, and all her old\r\nchildish ways o\' loving me.  Well, they went at last.  You know them\r\ntwo letters, Margaret?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sure," replied his grand-daughter.\r\n\r\n"Well, them two were the only letters I ever had fra\' her, poor\r\nlass.  She said in them she were very happy, and I believe she were.\r\nAnd Frank\'s family heard he were in good work.  In one o\' her\r\nletters, poor thing, she ends wi\' saying, \'Farewell, Grandad!\' wi\' a\r\nline drawn under grandad, and fra\' that an\' other hints I knew she\r\nwere in th\' family way; and I said nought, but I screwed up a\r\nlittle money, thinking come Whitsuntide I\'d take a holiday and go\r\nand see her an\' th\' little one.  But one day towards Whitsuntide,\r\ncomed Jennings wi\' a grave face, and says he, \'I hear our Frank and\r\nyour Margaret\'s both getten the fever.\'  You might ha\' knocked me\r\ndown wi\' a straw, for it seemed as if God told me what th\' upshot\r\nwould be.  Old Jennings had gotten a letter, you see, fra\' the\r\nlandlady they lodged wi\'; a well-penned letter, asking if they\'d no\r\nfriends to come and nurse them.  She\'d caught it first, and Frank,\r\nwho was as tender o\'er her as her own mother could ha\' been, had\r\nnursed her till he\'d caught it himsel; and she expecting her down-\r\nlying* everyday.  Well, t\' make a long story short, old Jennings and\r\nI went up by that night\'s coach.  So you see, Mary, that was the way\r\nI got to London."\r\n\r\n     *Down-lying; lying in.\r\n\r\n"But how was your daughter when you got there?" asked Mary\r\nanxiously.\r\n\r\n"She were at rest, poor wench, and so were Frank.  I guessed as much\r\nwhen I see\'d th\' landlady\'s face, all swelled wi\' crying, when she\r\nopened th\' door to us.  We said, \'Where are they?\' and I knew they\r\nwere dead, fra\' her look; but Jennings didn\'t, as I take it; for\r\nwhen she showed us into a room wi\' a white sheet on th\' bed, and\r\nunderneath it, plain to be seen, two still figures, he screeched out\r\nas if he\'d been a woman.\r\n\r\n"Yet he\'d other children and I\'d none.  There lay my darling, my\r\nonly one.  She were dead, and there were no one to love me, no, not\r\none.  I disremember* rightly what I did; but I know I were very\r\nquiet, while my heart were crushed within me.\r\n\r\n     *Disremember; forget.\r\n\r\n"Jennings could na\' stand being in the room at all, so the landlady\r\ntook him down, and I were glad to be alone.  It grew dark while I\r\nsat there; and at last th\' landlady came up again, and said, \'Come\r\nhere.\'  So I got up, and walked into the light, but I had to hold by\r\nth\' stair-rails, I were so weak and dizzy.  She led me into a room,\r\nwhere Jennings lay on a sofa fast asleep, wi\' his pocket-\r\nhandkerchief over his head for a night-cap.  She said he\'d cried\r\nhimself fairly off to sleep.  There were tea on th\' table all ready;\r\nfor she were a kind-hearted body.  But she still said, \'Come here,\'\r\nand took hold o\' my arm.  So I went round the table, and there were\r\na clothes-basket by th\' fire, wi\' a shawl put o\'er it.  \'Lift that\r\nup,\' says she, and I did; and there lay a little wee babby fast\r\nasleep.  My heart gave a leap, and th\' tears comed rushing into my\r\neyes first time that day.  \'Is it hers?\' said I, though I knew it\r\nwere.  \'Yes,\' said she.  \'She were getting a bit better o\' the\r\nfever, and th\' babby were born; and then the poor young man took\r\nworse and died, and she were not many hours behind.\'\r\n\r\n"Little mite of a thing! and yet it seemed her angel come back to\r\ncomfort me.  I were quite jealous o\' Jennings whenever he went near\r\nthe babby.  I thought it were more my flesh and blood than his\'n,\r\nand yet I were afraid he would claim it.  However, that were far\r\nenough fra\' his thoughts; he\'d plenty other childer, and, as I found\r\nout after, he\'d all along been wishing me to take it.  Well, we\r\nburied Margaret and her husband in a big, crowded, lonely churchyard\r\nin London.  I were loath to leave them there, as I thought, when\r\nthey rose again, they\'d feel so strange at first away fra\'\r\nManchester, and all old friends; but it could na be helped.  Well,\r\nGod watches o\'er their graves there as well as here.  That funeral\r\ncost a mint o\' money, but Jennings and I wished to do th\' thing\r\ndecent.  Then we\'d the stout little babby to bring home.  We\'d not\r\novermuch money left; but it were fine weather, and we thought we\'d\r\ntake th\' coach to Brummagem, and walk on.  It were a bright May\r\nmorning when I last saw London town, looking back from a big hill a\r\nmile or two off.  And in that big mass o\' a place I were leaving my\r\nblessed child asleep--in her last sleep.  Well, God\'s will be done!\r\nShe\'s gotten to heaven afore me; but I shall get there at last,\r\nplease God, though it\'s a long while first.\r\n\r\n"The babby had been fed afore we set out, and th\' coach moving kept\r\nit asleep, bless its little heart!  But when th\' coach stopped for\r\ndinner it were awake, and crying for its pobbies.*  So we asked for\r\nsome bread and milk, and Jennings took it first for to feed it, but\r\nit made its mouth like a square, and let it run out at each o\' the\r\nfour corners.  \'Shake it, Jennings,\' says I; \'that\'s the way they\r\nmake water run through a funnel, when it\'s o\'er full; and a child\'s\r\nmouth is broad end o\' th\' funnel, and th\' gullet the narrow one.\'\r\nSo he shook it, but it only cried th\' more.  \'Let me have it,\' says\r\nI, thinking he were an awkward oud chap.  But it were just as bad\r\nwi\' me.  By shaking th\' babby we got better nor a gill into its\r\nmouth, but more nor that came up again, wetting a\' th\' nice dry\r\nclothes landlady had put on.  Well, just as we\'d gotten to th\'\r\ndinner-table, and helped oursels, and eaten two mouthful, came in\r\nth\' guard, and a fine chap wi\' a sample of calico flourishing in his\r\nhand.  \'Coach is ready!\' says one; \'Half-a-crown your dinner!\' says\r\nthe other.  Well, we thought it a deal for both our dinners, when\r\nwe\'d hardly tasted \'em; but, bless your life, it were half-a-crown\r\napiece, and a shilling for th\' bread and milk as were possetted all\r\nover babby\'s clothes.  We spoke up again** it; but everybody said it\r\nwere the rule, so what could two poor oud chaps like us do again it?\r\nWell, poor babby cried without stopping to take breath, fra\' that\r\ntime till we got to Brummagem for the night.  My heart ached for th\'\r\nlittle thing.  It caught wi\' its wee mouth at our coat sleeves and\r\nat our mouths, when we tried t\' comfort it by talking to it.  Poor\r\nlittle wench! it wanted its mammy, as were lying cold in th\' grave.\r\n\'Well,\' says I, \'it\'ll be clemmed to death, if it lets out its\r\nsupper as it did its dinner.  Let\'s get some woman to feed it; it\r\ncomes natural to women to do for babbies.\'  So we asked th\'\r\nchambermaid at the inn, and she took quite kindly to it; and we got\r\na good supper, and grew rare and sleepy, what wi\' th\' warmth and wi\'\r\nour long ride i\' the open air.  Th\' chambermaid said she would like\r\nt\' have it t\' sleep wi\' her, only missis would scold so; but it\r\nlooked so quiet and smiling like, as it lay in her arms, that we\r\nthought \'t would be no trouble to have it wi\' us.  I says: \'See,\r\nJennings, how women folk do quieten babbies; it\'s just as I said.\'\r\nHe looked grave; he were always thoughtful-looking, though I never\r\nheard him say anything very deep.  At last says he--\r\n\r\n"\'Young woman! have you gotten a spare nightcap?\'\r\n\r\n"\'Missis always keeps nightcaps for gentlemen as does not like to\r\nunpack,\' says she, rather quick.\r\n\r\n     *"Pobbies," or "pobs," child\'s porridge.\r\n    **"Again," for against.  "He that is not with me, he is ageyn me."\r\n                              --Wickliffe\'s Version.\r\n\r\n"\'Ay, but young woman, it\'s one of your nightcaps I want.  Th\' babby\r\nseems to have taken a mind to yo; and maybe in th\' dark it might\r\ntake me for yo if I\'d getten your nightcap on.\'\r\n\r\n"The chambermaid smirked and went for a cap, but I laughed outright\r\nat th\' oud bearded chap thinking he\'d make hissel like a woman just\r\nby putting on a woman\'s cap.  Howe\'er he\'d not be laughed out on\'t,\r\nso I held th\' babby till he were in bed.  Such a night as we had on\r\nit!  Babby began to scream o\' th\' oud fashion, and we took it turn\r\nand turn about to sit up and rock it.  My heart were very sore for\r\nthe little one, as it groped about wi\' its mouth; but for a\' that I\r\ncould scarce keep fra\' smiling at th\' thought o\' us two oud chaps,\r\nth\' one wi\' a woman\'s nightcap on, sitting on our hinder ends for\r\nhalf the night, hushabying a babby as wouldn\'t be hushabied.  Toward\r\nmorning, poor little wench! it fell asleep, fairly tired out wi\'\r\ncrying, but even in its sleep it gave such pitiful sobs, quivering\r\nup fra\' the very bottom of its little heart, that once or twice I\r\nalmost wished it lay on its mother\'s breast, at peace for ever.\r\nJennings fell asleep too; but I began for to reckon up our money.\r\nIt were little enough we had left, our dinner the day afore had\r\nta\'en so much.  I didn\'t know what our reckoning would be for that\r\nnight lodging, and supper, and breakfast.  Doing a sum always sent\r\nme asleep ever sin\' I were a lad; so I fell sound in a short time,\r\nand were only wakened by chambermaid tapping at th\' door, to say\r\nshe\'d dress the babby before her missis were up if we liked.  But\r\nbless yo, we\'d never thought o\' undressing it the night afore, and\r\nnow it were sleeping so sound, and we were so glad o\' the peace and\r\nquietness, that we thought it were no good to waken it up to screech\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n"Well! (there\'s Mary asleep for a good listener!) I suppose you\'re\r\ngetting weary of my tale, so I\'ll not be long over ending it.  Th\'\r\nreckoning left us very bare, and we thought we\'d best walk home, for\r\nit were only sixty mile, they telled us, and not stop again for\r\nnought, save victuals.  So we left Brummagem (which is as black a\r\nplace as Manchester, without looking so like home), and walked a\'\r\nthat day, carrying babby turn and turn about.  It were well fed by\r\nchambermaid afore we left, and th\' day were fine, and folk began to\r\nhave some knowledge o\' th\' proper way o\' speaking, and we were more\r\ncheery at thought o\' home (though mine, God knows, were lonesome\r\nenough).  We stopped none for dinner, but at baggin-time* we getten\r\na good meal at a public-house, an\' fed th\' babby as well as we\r\ncould, but that were but poorly.  We got a crust too for it to\r\nsuck--chambermaid put us up to that.  That night, whether we were\r\ntired or whatten, I don\'t know, but it were dree** work, and th\'\r\npoor little wench had slept out her sleep, and began th\' cry as wore\r\nmy heart out again.  Says Jennings, says he--\r\n\r\n"\'We should na ha\' set out so like gentlefolk a top o\' the coach\r\nyesterday.\'\r\n\r\n     *Baggin-time; time of the evening meal.\r\n    **Dree; long and tedious.  Anglo-Saxon, "dreogan," to suffer, to\r\n      endure.\r\n\r\n"\'Nay, lad!  We should ha\' had more to walk if we had na ridden, and\r\nI\'m sure both you and I\'se* weary o\' tramping.\'\r\n\r\n     *"I have not been, nor IS, nor never schal."--Wickliffe\'s Apology,\r\n       p. I.\r\n\r\n"So he were quiet a bit.  But he were one o\' them as were sure to\r\nfind out somewhat had been done amiss when there were no going back\r\nto undo it.  So presently he coughs, as if he were going to speak,\r\nand I says to myself, \'At it again, my lad.\'  Says he--\r\n\r\n"\'I ax pardon, neighbour, but it strikes me it would ha\' been better\r\nfor my son if he had never begun to keep company wi\' your daughter.\'\r\n\r\n"Well! that put me up, and my heart got very full, and but that I\r\nwere carrying HER babby, I think I should ha\' struck him.  At last I\r\ncould hold in no longer, and says I--\r\n\r\n"\'Better say at once it would ha\' been better for God never to ha\'\r\nmade th\' world, for then we\'d never ha\' been in it, to have had th\'\r\nheavy hearts we have now.\'\r\n\r\n"Well! he said that were rank blasphemy; but I thought his way of\r\ncasting up again th\' events God had pleased to send, were worse\r\nblasphemy.  Howe\'er, I said nought more angry, for th\' little\r\nbabby\'s sake, as were th\' child o\' his dead son, as well as o\' my\r\ndead daughter.\r\n\r\n"Th\' longest lane will have a turning, and that night came to an end\r\nat last; and we were footsore and tired enough, and to my mind the\r\nbabby were getting weaker and weaker, and it wrung my heart to hear\r\nits little wail!  I\'d ha\' given my right hand for one of yesterday\'s\r\nhearty cries.  We were wanting our breakfasts, and so were it too,\r\nmotherless babby!  We could see no public-houses, so about six\r\no\'clock (only we thought it were later) we stopped at a cottage,\r\nwhere a woman were moving about near th\' open door.  Says I, \'Good\r\nwoman, may we rest us a bit?\'  \'Come in,\' says she, wiping a chair,\r\nas looked bright enough afore, wi\' her apron.  It were a cheery,\r\nclean room; and we were glad to sit down again, though I thought my\r\nlegs would never bend at th\' knees.  In a minute she fell a noticing\r\nth\' babby, and took it in her arms, and kissed it again and again.\r\n\'Missis,\' says I, \'we\'re not without money and if yo\'d give us\r\nsomewhat for breakfast, we\'d pay yo honest, and if yo would wash and\r\ndress that poor babby, and get some pobbies down its throat, for\r\nit\'s well-nigh clemmed, I\'d pray for you till my dying day.\'  So she\r\nsaid nought but gived me th\' babby back, and afore you could say\r\nJack Robinson, she\'d a pan on th\' fire, and bread and cheese on th\'\r\ntable.  When she turned round, her face looked red, and her lips\r\nwere tight pressed together.  Well! we were right down glad on our\r\nbreakfast, and God bless and reward that woman for her kindness that\r\nday!  She fed th\' poor babby as gently and softly, and spoke to it\r\nas tenderly as its own poor mother could ha\' done.  It seemed as if\r\nthat stranger and it had known each other afore, maybe in heaven,\r\nwhere folk\'s spirits come from, they say; th\' babby looked up so\r\nlovingly in her eyes, and made little noises more like a dove than\r\naught else.  Then she undressed it (poor darling! it were time),\r\ntouching it so softly; and washed it from head to foot; and as many\r\non its clothes were dirty, and what bits o\' things its mother had\r\ngotten ready for it had been sent by th\' carrier fra\' London, she\r\nput \'em aside; and wrapping little naked babby in her apron, she\r\npulled out a key, as were fastened to a black ribbon, and hung down\r\nher breast, and unlocked a drawer in th\' dresser.  I were sorry to\r\nbe prying, but I could na help seeing in that drawer some little\r\nchild\'s clothes, all strewed wi\' lavender, and lying by \'em a little\r\nwhip an\' a broken rattle.  I began to have an insight into that\r\nwoman\'s heart then.  She took out a thing or two and locked the\r\ndrawer, and went on dressing babby.  Just about then come her\r\nhusband down, a great big fellow as didn\'t look half awake, though\r\nit were getting late; but he\'d heard all as had been said\r\ndownstairs, as were plain to be seen; but he were a gruff chap.\r\nWe\'d finished our breakfast, and Jennings were looking hard at th\'\r\nwoman as she were getting the babby to sleep wi\' a sort of rocking\r\nway.  At length says he, \'I ha\' learnt th\' way now; it\'s two jiggits\r\nand a shake, two jiggits and a shake.  I can get that babby asleep\r\nnow mysel.\'\r\n\r\n"The man had nodded cross enough to us, and had gone to th\' door,\r\nand stood there, whistling wi\' his hands in his breeches-pockets,\r\nlooking abroad.  But at last he turns and says, quite sharp--\r\n\r\n"\'I say, missis, I\'m to have no breakfast to-day, I s\'pose.\'\r\n\r\n"So wi\' that she kissed th\' child, a long, soft kiss, and looking in\r\nmy face to see if I could take her meaning, gave me th\' babby\r\nwithout a word.  I were loath to stir, but I saw it were better to\r\ngo.  So giving Jennings a sharp nudge (for he\'d fallen asleep), I\r\nsays, \'Missis, what\'s to pay?\' pulling out my money wi\' a jingle\r\nthat she might na guess we were at all bare o\' cash.  So she looks\r\nat her husband, who said ne\'er a word, but were listening with all\r\nhis ears nevertheless; and when she saw he would na say, she said,\r\nhesitating, as if  pulled two ways, by her fear o\' him, \'Should you\r\nthink sixpence over much?\'  It were so different to public-house\r\nreckoning, for we\'d eaten a main deal afore the chap came down.  So\r\nsays I, \'And, missis, what should we gi\' you for the babby\'s bread\r\nand milk?\'  (I had it once in my mind to say \'and for a\' your\r\ntrouble with it,\' but my heart would na let me say it, for I could\r\nread in her ways how it had been a work o\' love).  So says she,\r\nquite quick, and stealing a look at her husband\'s back, as looked\r\nall ear, if ever a back did, \'Oh, we could take nought for the\r\nlittle babby\'s food, if it had eaten twice as much, bless it.\'  Wi\'\r\nthat he looked at her; such a scowling look!  She knew what he\r\nmeant, and stepped softly across the floor to him, and put her hand\r\non his arm.  He seem\'d as though he\'d shake it off by a jerk on his\r\nelbow, but she said quite low, \'For poor little Johnnie\'s sake,\r\nRichard.\'  He did not move or speak again, and after looking in his\r\nface for a minute, she turned away, swallowing deep in her throat.\r\nShe kissed th\' sleeping babby as she passed, when I paid her.  To\r\nquieten th\' gruff husband, and stop him if he rated her, I could na\r\nhelp slipping another sixpence under th\' loaf, and then we set off\r\nagain.  Last look I had o\' that woman she were quietly wiping her\r\neyes wi\' the corner of her apron, as she went about her husband\'s\r\nbreakfast.  But I shall know her in heaven."\r\n\r\nHe stopped to think of that long ago May morning, when he had\r\ncarried his grand-daughter under the distant hedgerows and beneath\r\nthe flowering sycamores.\r\n\r\n"There\'s nought more to say, wench," said he to Margaret, as she\r\nbegged him to go on.  "That night we reached Manchester, and I\'d\r\nfound out that Jennings would be glad enough to give up babby to me,\r\nso I took her home at once, and a blessing she\'s been to me."\r\n\r\nThey were all silent for a few minutes; each following out the\r\ncurrent of their thoughts.  Then, almost simultaneously, their\r\nattention fell upon Mary.  Sitting on her little stool, her head\r\nresting on her father\'s knee, and sleeping as soundly as any infant,\r\nher breath (still like an infant\'s) came and went as softly as a\r\nbird steals to her leafy nest.  Her half-open mouth was as scarlet\r\nas the winter-berries, and contrasted finely with the clear paleness\r\nof her complexion, where the eloquent blood flushed carnation at\r\neach motion.  Her black eye-lashes lay on the delicate cheek, which\r\nwas still more shaded by the masses of her golden hair, that seemed\r\nto form a nest-like pillar for her as she lay.  Her father in fond\r\npride straightened one glossy curl, for an instant, as if to display\r\nits length and silkiness.\r\n\r\nThe little action awoke her, and, like nine out of ten people in\r\nsimilar circumstances, she exclaimed, opening her eyes to their\r\nfullest extent--\r\n\r\n"I\'m not asleep.  I\'ve been awake all the time."\r\n\r\nEven her father could not keep from smiling, and Job Legh and\r\nMargaret laughed outright.\r\n\r\n"Come, wench," said Job, "don\'t look so gloppened* because thou\'st\r\nfallen asleep while an oud chap like me was talking on oud times.\r\nIt were like enough to send thee to sleep.  Try if thou canst keep\r\nthine eyes open while I read thy father a bit on a poem as is\r\nwritten by a weaver like oursel.  A rare chap I\'ll be bound is he\r\nwho could weave verse like this."\r\n\r\n     *Gloppened; amazed, frightened.\r\n\r\nSo adjusting his spectacles on nose, cocking his chin, crossing his\r\nlegs, and coughing to clear his voice, he read aloud a little poem\r\nof Samuel Bamford\'s* he had picked up somewhere.\r\n\r\n     *The fine-spirited author of \'Passages in the Life of a Radical\'--\r\n      a man who illustrates his order, and shows what nobility may be\r\n      in a cottage.\r\n\r\n     God help the poor, who, on this wintry morn,\r\n        Come forth from alleys dim and courts obscure.\r\n     God help yon poor pale girl, who droops forlorn,\r\n        And meekly her affliction doth endure;\r\n     God help her, outcast lamb; she trembling stands,\r\n     All wan her lips, and frozen red her hands\r\n     Her sunken eyes are modestly downcast,\r\n     Her night-black hair streams on the fitful blast;\r\n     Her bosom, passing fair, is half revealed,\r\n     And oh! so cold, the snow lies there congealed;\r\n     Her feet benumbed, her shoes all rent and worn,\r\n     God help thee, outcast lamb, who standst forlorn!\r\n                                    God help the poor!\r\n\r\n     God help the poor!  An infant\'s feeble wail\r\n        Comes from yon narrow gateway, and behold!\r\n     A female crouching there, so deathly pale,\r\n        Huddling her child, to screen it from the cold;\r\n     Her vesture scant, her bonnet crushed and torn;\r\n        A thin shawl doth her baby dear enfold.\r\n     And so she \'bides the ruthless gale of morn,\r\n        Which almost to her heart hath sent its cold.\r\n     And now she, sudden, darts a ravening look,\r\n     As one, with new hot bread, goes past the nook;\r\n     And, as the tempting load is onward borne,\r\n     She weeps.  God help thee, helpless one, forlorn!\r\n                                    God help the poor!\r\n\r\n     God help the poor!  Behold yon famished lad,\r\n        No shoes, nor hose, his wounded feet protect;\r\n     With limping gait, and looks so dreamy sad,\r\n        He wanders onward, stopping to inspect\r\n     Each window stored with articles of food.\r\n        He yearns but to enjoy one cheering meal;\r\n     Oh! to the hungry palate viands rude\r\n        Would yield a zest the famished only feel!\r\n     He now devours a crust of mouldy bread;\r\n        With teeth and hands the precious boon is torn\r\n     Unmindful of the storm that round his head\r\n        Impetuous sweeps.  God help thee, child forlorn!\r\n                                      God help the poor!\r\n\r\n     God help the poor!  Another have I found--\r\n        A bowed and venerable man is he;\r\n     His slouch-ed hat with faded crape is bound;\r\n        His coat is grey, and threadbare too, I see.\r\n     "The rude winds" seem "to mock his hoary hair":\r\n     His shirtless bosom to the blast is bare.\r\n     Anon he turns and casts a wistful eye,\r\n        And with scant napkin wipes the blinding spray,\r\n     And looks around, as if he fain would spy\r\n        Friends he had feasted in his better day:\r\n     Ah! some are dead: and some have long forborne\r\n     To know the poor; and he is left forlorn!\r\n                                      God help the poor!\r\n\r\n     God help the poor, who in lone valleys dwell,\r\n        Or by far hills, where whin and heather grow;\r\n     Theirs is a story sad indeed to tell;\r\n        Yet little cares the world, and less \'t would know\r\n        About the toil and want men undergo.\r\n     The wearying loom doth call them up at morn;\r\n        They work till worn-out nature sinks to sleep;\r\n        They taste, but are not fed.  The snow drifts deep\r\n        Around the fireless cot, and blocks the door;\r\n        The night-storm howls a dirge across the moor;\r\n     And shall they perish thus--oppressed and lorn?\r\n     Shall toil and famine, hopeless, still be borne?\r\n        No! God will yet arise and help the poor!\r\n\r\n"Amen!" said Barton, solemnly and sorrowfully.  "Mary! wench,\r\ncouldst thou copy me them lines, dost think?--that\'s to say, if Job\r\nthere has no objection."\r\n\r\n"Not I.  More they\'re heard and read and the better, say I."\r\n\r\nSo Mary took the paper.  And the next day, on a blank half-sheet of\r\na valentine, all bordered with hearts and darts--a valentine she had\r\nonce suspected to come from Jem Wilson--she copied Bamford\'s\r\nbeautiful little poem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX.   RETURN OF THE PRODIGAL.\r\n\r\n     "My heart, once soft as woman\'s tear, is gnarled\r\n      With gloating on the ills I cannot cure."\r\n                                            --ELLIOTT.\r\n\r\n     "Then guard and shield her innocence,\r\n        Let her not fall like me;\r\n     \'T were better, oh! a thousand times,\r\n        She in her grave should be."\r\n                                        --The Outcast.\r\n\r\nDespair settled down like a heavy cloud; and now and then, through\r\nthe dead calm of sufferings, came pipings of stormy winds,\r\nforetelling the end of these dark prognostics.  In times of\r\nsorrowful or fierce endurance, we are often soothed by the mere\r\nrepetition of old proverbs which tell the experience of our\r\nforefathers; but now, "it\'s a long lane that has no turning," "the\r\nweariest day draws to an end," etc., seemed false and vain sayings,\r\nso long and so weary was the pressure of the terrible times.  Deeper\r\nand deeper still sank the poor.  It showed how much lingering\r\nsuffering it takes to kill men, that so few (in comparison) died\r\nduring those times.  But remember! we only miss those who do men\'s\r\nwork in their humble sphere; the aged, the feeble, the children,\r\nwhen they die, are hardly noted by the world; and yet to many\r\nhearts, their deaths make a blank which long years will never fill\r\nup.  Remember, too, that though it may take much suffering to kill\r\nthe able-bodied and effective members of society, it does NOT take\r\nmuch to reduce them to worn, listless, diseased creatures, who\r\nthenceforward crawl through life with moody hearts and pain-stricken\r\nbodies.\r\n\r\nThe people had thought the poverty of the preceding years hard to\r\nbear, and had found its yoke heavy; but this year added sorely to\r\nits weight.  Former times had chastised them with whips, but this\r\nchastised them with scorpions.\r\n\r\nOf course, Barton had his share of mere bodily sufferings.  Before\r\nhe had gone up to London on his vain errand, he had been working\r\nshort time.  But in the hopes of speedy redress by means of the\r\ninterference of Parliament, he had thrown up his place; and now,\r\nwhen he asked leave to resume his work, he was told they were\r\ndiminishing their number of hands every week, and he was made aware,\r\nby the remarks of fellow-workmen, that a Chartist delegate, and a\r\nleading member of a Trades\' Union, was not likely to be favoured in\r\nhis search after employment.  Still he tried to keep up a brave\r\nheart concerning himself.  He knew he could bear hunger; for that\r\npower of endurance had been called forth when he was a little child,\r\nand had seen his mother hide her daily morsel to share it among her\r\nchildren, and when he, being the eldest, had told the noble lie,\r\nthat "he was not hungry, could not eat a bit more," in order to\r\nimitate his mother\'s bravery, and still the sharp wail of the\r\nyounger infants.  Mary, too, was secure of two meals a day at Miss\r\nSimmonds\'; though, by the way, the dressmaker too, feeling the\r\neffect of bad times, had left off giving tea to her apprentices,\r\nsetting them the example of long abstinence by putting off her own\r\nmeal till work was done for the night, however late that might be.\r\n\r\nBut the rent!  It was half-a-crown a week--nearly all Mary\'s\r\nearnings--and much less room might do for them, only two.--(Now came\r\nthe time to be thankful that the early dead were saved from the evil\r\nto come.)--The agricultural labourer generally has strong local\r\nattachments; but they are far less common, almost obliterated, among\r\nthe inhabitants of a town.  Still there are exceptions, and Barton\r\nformed one.  He had removed to his present house just after the last\r\nbad times, when little Tom had sickened and died.  He had then\r\nthought the bustle of a removal would give his poor stunned wife\r\nsomething to do, and he had taken more interest in the details of\r\nthe proceeding than he otherwise would have done, in the hope of\r\ncalling her forth to action again.  So he seemed to know every\r\nbrass-headed nail driven up for her convenience.  Only one had been\r\ndisplaced.  It was Esther\'s bonnet nail, which in his deep\r\nrevengeful anger against her, after his wife\'s death, he had torn\r\nout of the wall, and cast into the street.  It would be hard work to\r\nleave the house, which yet seemed hallowed by his wife\'s presence in\r\nthe happy days of old.  But he was a law unto himself, though\r\nsometimes a bad, fierce law; and he resolved to give the\r\nrent-collector notice, and look out for a cheaper abode, and tell\r\nMary they must flit.  Poor Mary! she loved the house, too.  It was\r\nwrenching up her natural feelings of home, for it would be long\r\nbefore the fibres of her heart would gather themselves about another\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nThis trial was spared.  The collector (of himself), on the very\r\nMonday when Barton planned to give him notice of his intention to\r\nleave, lowered the rent threepence a week, just enough to make\r\nBarton compromise and agree to stay on a little longer.\r\n\r\nBut by degrees the house was stripped of all its little ornaments.\r\nSome were broken; and the odd twopences and threepences, wanted to\r\npay for their repairs, were required for the far sterner necessity\r\nof food.  And by-and-bye Mary began to part with other superfluities\r\nat the pawn-shop.  The smart tea-tray and tea-caddy, long and\r\ncarefully kept, went for bread for her father.  He did not ask for\r\nit, or complain, but she saw hunger in his shrunk, fierce, animal\r\nlook.  Then the blankets went, for it was summer time, and they\r\ncould spare them; and their sale made a fund, which Mary fancied\r\nwould last till better times came.  But it was soon all gone; and\r\nthen she looked around the room to crib it of its few remaining\r\nornaments.  To all these proceedings her father said never a word.\r\nIf he fasted, or feasted (after the sale of some article) on an\r\nunusual meal of bread and cheese, he took all with a sullen\r\nindifference, which depressed Mary\'s heart.  She often wished he\r\nwould apply for relief from the Guardians\' relieving office; often\r\nwondered the Trades\' Union did nothing for him.  Once, when she\r\nasked him as he sat, grimed, unshaven, and gaunt, after a day\'s\r\nfasting, over the fire, why he did not get relief from the town, he\r\nturned round, with grim wrath, and said, "I don\'t want money, child!\r\nD--n their charity and their money!  I want work, and it is my\r\nright.  I want work."\r\n\r\nHe would bear it all, he said to himself.  And he did bear it, but\r\nnot meekly; that was too much to expect.  Real meekness of character\r\nis called out by experience of kindness.  And few had been kind to\r\nhim.  Yet through it all, with stern determination he refused the\r\nassistance his Trades\' Union would have given him.  It had not much\r\nto give, but, with worldly wisdom, thought it better to propitiate\r\nan active, useful member, than to help those who were more\r\nunenergetic, though they had large families to provide for.  Not so\r\nthought John Barton.  With him, need was right.\r\n\r\n"Give it to Tom Darbyshire," he said.  "He\'s more claim on it than\r\nme, for he\'s more need of it, with his seven children."\r\n\r\nNow Tom Darbyshire was, in his listless, grumbling way, a back-\r\nbiting enemy of John Barton\'s.  And he knew it; but he was not to be\r\ninfluenced by that in a matter like this.\r\n\r\nMary went early to her work; but her cheery laugh over it was now\r\nmissed by the other girls.  Her mind wandered over the present\r\ndistress, and then settled, as she stitched, on the visions of the\r\nfuture, where yet her thoughts dwelt more on the circumstances of\r\nease, and the pomps and vanities awaiting her, than on the lover\r\nwith whom she was to share them.  Still she was not insensible to\r\nthe pride of having attracted one so far above herself in station;\r\nnot insensible to the secret pleasure of knowing that he, whom so\r\nmany admired, had often said he would give anything for one of her\r\nsweet smiles.  Her love for him was a bubble, blown out of vanity;\r\nbut it looked very real and very bright.  Sally Leadbitter,\r\nmeanwhile, keenly observed the signs of the times; she found out\r\nthat Mary had begun to affix a stern value to money as the\r\n"Purchaser of Life," and many girls had been dazzled and lured by\r\ngold, even without the betraying love which she believed to exist in\r\nMary\'s heart.  So she urged young Mr. Carson, by representations of\r\nthe want she was sure surrounded Mary, to bring matters more to a\r\npoint.  But he had a kind of instinctive dread of hurting Mary\'s\r\npride of spirit, and durst not hint his knowledge in any way of the\r\ndistress that many must be enduring.  He felt that for the present\r\nhe must still be content with stolen meetings and summer evening\r\nstrolls, and the delight of pouring sweet honeyed words into her\r\near, while she listened with a blush and a smile that made her look\r\nradiant with beauty.  No; he would be cautious in order to be\r\ncertain; for Mary, one way or another, he must make his.  He had no\r\ndoubt of the effect of his own personal charms in the long run; for\r\nhe knew he was handsome, and believed himself fascinating.\r\n\r\nIf he had known what Mary\'s home was, he would not have been so much\r\nconvinced of his increasing influence over her, by her being more\r\nand more ready to linger with him in the sweet summer air.  For when\r\nshe returned for the night her father was often out, and the house\r\nwanted the cheerful look it had had in the days when money was never\r\nwanted to purchase soap and brushes, black-lead and pipe-clay.  It\r\nwas dingy and comfortless; for, of course, there was not even the\r\ndumb familiar home-friend, a fire.  And Margaret, too, was now very\r\noften from home, singing at some of those grand places.  And Alice;\r\noh, Mary wished she had never left her cellar to go and live at\r\nAncoats with her sister-in-law.  For in that matter Mary felt very\r\nguilty; she had put off and put off going to see the widow, after\r\nGeorge Wilson\'s death, from dread of meeting Jem, or giving him\r\nreason to think she wished to be as intimate with him as formerly;\r\nand now she was so much ashamed of her delay that she was likely\r\nnever to go at all.\r\n\r\nIf her father was at home it was no better; indeed, it was worse.\r\nHe seldom spoke, less than ever; and often when he did speak, they\r\nwere sharp angry words, such as he had never given her formerly.\r\nHer temper was high, too, and her answers not over mild; and once in\r\nhis passion he had even beaten her.  If Sally Leadbitter or Mr.\r\nCarson had been at hand at that moment, Mary would have been ready\r\nto leave home for ever.  She sat alone, after her father had flung\r\nout of the house, bitterly thinking on the days that were gone;\r\nangry with her own hastiness, and believing that her father did not\r\nlove her; striving to heap up one painful thought on another.  Who\r\ncared for her?  Mr. Carson might, but in this grief that seemed no\r\ncomfort.  Mother dead!  Father so often angry, so lately cruel (for\r\nit was a hard blow, and blistered and reddened Mary\'s soft white\r\nskin with pain): and then her heart turned round, and she\r\nremembered with self-reproach how provokingly she had looked and\r\nspoken, and how much her father had to bear; and oh, what a kind and\r\nloving parent he had been, till these days of trial.  The\r\nremembrance of one little instance of his fatherly love thronged\r\nafter another into her mind, and she began to wonder how she could\r\nhave behaved to him as she had done.\r\n\r\nThen he came home; and but for very shame she would have confessed\r\nher penitence in words.  But she looked sullen, from her effort to\r\nkeep down emotion; and for some time her father did not know how to\r\nbegin to speak.  At length he gulped down pride, and said--\r\n\r\n"Mary, I\'m not above saying I\'m very sorry I beat thee.  Thou wert a\r\nbit aggravating, and I\'m not the man I was.  But it were wrong, and\r\nI\'ll try never to lay hands on thee again."\r\n\r\nSo he held out his arms, and in many tears she told him her\r\nrepentance for her fault.  He never struck her again.\r\n\r\nStill, he often was angry.  But that was almost better than being\r\nsilent.  Then he sat near the fireplace (from habit) smoking, or\r\nchewing opium.  Oh, how Mary loathed that smell!  And in the dusk,\r\njust before it merged into the short summer night, she had learned\r\nto look with dread towards the window, which now her father would\r\nhave kept uncurtained: for there were not seldom seen sights which\r\nhaunted her in her dreams.  Strange faces of pale men, with dark\r\nglaring eyes, peered into the inner darkness, and seemed desirous to\r\nascertain if her father was at home.  Or, a hand and arm (the body\r\nhidden) was put within the door, and beckoned him away.  He always\r\nwent.  And once or twice, when Mary was in bed, she heard men\'s\r\nvoices below, in earnest, whispered talk.\r\n\r\nThey were all desperate members of Trades\' Unions, ready for\r\nanything; made ready by want.\r\n\r\nWhile all this change for gloom yet struck fresh and heavy on Mary\'s\r\nheart, her father startled her out of a reverie one evening, by\r\nasking her when she had been to see Jane Wilson.  From his manner of\r\nspeaking, she was made aware that he had been; but at the time of\r\nhis visit he had never mentioned anything about it.  Now, however,\r\nhe gruffly told her to go next day without fail, and added some\r\nabuse of her for not having been before.  The little outward impulse\r\nof her father\'s speech gave Mary the push which she in this instance\r\nrequired; and accordingly, timing her visit so as to avoid Jem\'s\r\nhours at home, she went the following afternoon to Ancoats.\r\n\r\nThe outside of the well-known house struck her as different; for the\r\ndoor was closed, instead of open, as it once had always stood.  The\r\nwindow-plants, George Wilson\'s pride and especial care, looked\r\nwithering and drooping.  They had been without water for a long\r\ntime, and now, when the widow had reproached herself severely for\r\nneglect, in her ignorant anxiety she gave them too much.  On opening\r\nthe door, Alice was seen, not stirring about in her habitual way,\r\nbut knitting by the fireside.  The room felt hot, although the fire\r\nburnt grey and dim, under the bright rays of the afternoon sun.\r\nMrs. Wilson was "siding"* the dinner things, and talking all the\r\ntime, in a kind of whining, shouting voice, which Mary did not at\r\nfirst understand.  She understood, at once, however, that her\r\nabsence had been noted, and talked over; she saw a constrained look\r\non Mrs. Wilson\'s sorrow-stricken face, which told her a scolding was\r\nto come.\r\n\r\n     *To "side," to put aside, or in order.\r\n\r\n"Dear!  Mary, is that you?" she began.  "Why, who would ha\' dreamt\r\nof seeing you!  We thought you\'d clean forgotten us; and Jem has\r\noften wondered if he should know you, if he met you in the street."\r\n\r\nNow, poor Jane Wilson had been sorely tried; and at present her\r\ntrials had had no outward effect, but that of increased acerbity of\r\ntemper.  She wished to show Mary how much she was offended, and\r\nmeant to strengthen her cause, by putting some of her own sharp\r\nspeeches into Jem\'s mouth.\r\n\r\nMary felt guilty, and had no good reason to give as an apology; so\r\nfor a minute she stood silent, looking very much ashamed, and then\r\nturned to speak to Aunt Alice, who, in her surprised, hearty\r\ngreeting to Mary, had dropped her ball of worsted, and was busy,\r\ntrying to set the thread to rights, before the kitten had entangled\r\nit past redemption, once round every chair, and twice round the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n"You mun speak louder than that, if you mean her to hear; she\'s\r\nbecome as deaf as a post this last few weeks.  I\'d ha\' told you, if\r\nI\'d remembered how long it were sin\' you\'d seen her."\r\n\r\n"Yes, my dear, I\'m getting very hard o\' hearing of late," said\r\nAlice, catching the state of the case, with her quick glancing eyes.\r\n"I suppose it\'s the beginning of the end."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t talk o\' that way," screamed her sister-in-law.  "We\'ve had\r\nenow of ends and deaths without forecasting more."  She covered her\r\nface with her apron, and sat down to cry.\r\n\r\n"He was such a good husband," said she, in a less excited tone, to\r\nMary, as she looked up with tear-streaming eyes from behind her\r\napron.  "No one can tell what I\'ve lost in him, for no one knew his\r\nworth like me."\r\n\r\nMary\'s listening sympathy softened her, and she went on to unburden\r\nher heavy-laden heart.\r\n\r\n"Eh, dear, dear!  No one knows what I\'ve lost.  When my poor boys\r\nwent, I thought the Almighty had crushed me to th\' ground, but I\r\nnever thought o\' losing George; I did na think I could ha\' borne to\r\nha\' lived without him.  And yet I\'m here, and he\'s"--A fresh burst\r\nof crying interrupted her speech.\r\n\r\n"Mary,"--beginning to speak again,--"did you ever hear what a poor\r\ncreature I were when he married me?  And he such a handsome fellow!\r\nJem\'s nothing to what his father were at his age."\r\n\r\nYes! Mary had heard, and so she said.  But the poor woman\'s thoughts\r\nhad gone back to those days, and her little recollections came out,\r\nwith many interruptions of sighs, and tears, and shakes of the head.\r\n\r\n"There were nought about me for him to choose me.  I were just well\r\nenough afore that accident, but at after I were downright plain.\r\nAnd there was Bessy Witter as would ha\' given her eyes for him; she\r\nas is Mrs. Carson now, for she were a handsome lass, although I\r\nnever could see her beauty then; and Carson warn\'t so much above\r\nher, as they\'re both above us all now."\r\n\r\nMary went very red, and wished she could help doing so, and wished\r\nalso that Mrs. Wilson would tell her more about the father and\r\nmother of her lover; but she durst not ask, and Mrs. Wilson\'s\r\nthoughts soon returned to her husband, and their early married days.\r\n\r\n"If you\'ll believe me, Mary, there never was such a born goose at\r\nhousekeeping as I were; and yet he married me!  I had been in a\r\nfactory sin\' five years old a\'most, and I knew nought about\r\ncleaning, or cooking, let alone washing and such like work.  The day\r\nafter we were married, he went to his work at after breakfast, and\r\nsays he, \'Jenny, we\'ll ha\' th\' cold beef, and potatoes, and that\'s a\r\ndinner for a prince.\'  I were anxious to make him comfortable, God\r\nknows how anxious.  And yet I\'d no notion how to cook a potato.  I\r\nknow\'d they were boiled, and know\'d their skins were taken off, and\r\nthat were all.  So I tidied my house in a rough kind o\' way, then I\r\nlooked at that very clock up yonder,"--pointing at one that hung\r\nagainst the wall--"and I seed it were nine o\'clock, so, thinks I,\r\nth\' potatoes shall be well boiled at any rate, and I gets \'em on th\'\r\nfire in a jiffy (that\'s to say, as soon as I could peel \'em, which\r\nwere a tough job at first), and then I fell to unpacking my boxes!\r\nand at twenty minutes past twelve, he comes home, and I had the beef\r\nready on th\' table, and I went to take the potatoes out o\' th\' pot;\r\nbut oh! Mary, th\' water had boiled away, and they were all a nasty\r\nbrown mess, as smelt through all the house.  He said nought, and\r\nwere very gentle; but oh! Mary, I cried so that afternoon.  I shall\r\nne\'er forget it; no, never.  I made many a blunder at after, but\r\nnone that fretted me like that."\r\n\r\n"Father does not like girls to work in factories," said Mary.\r\n\r\n"No, I know he does not; and reason good.  They oughtn\'t to go at\r\nafter they\'re married, that I\'m very clear about.  I could reckon\r\nup,"--counting with her finger--"ay, nine men, I know, as has been\r\ndriven to th\' public-house by having wives as worked in factories;\r\ngood folk, too, as thought there was no harm in putting their little\r\nones out to nurse, and letting their house go all dirty, and their\r\nfires all out; and that was a place as was tempting for a husband to\r\nstay in, was it?  He soon finds out gin-shops, where all is clean\r\nand bright, and where th\' fire blazes cheerily, and gives a man a\r\nwelcome as it were."\r\n\r\nAlice, who was standing near for the convenience of hearing, had\r\ncaught much of this speech, and it was evident the subject had\r\npreviously been discussed by the women, for she chimed in.\r\n\r\n"I wish our Jem could speak a word to th\' Queen, about factory work\r\nfor married women.  Eh! but he comes it strong when once yo get him\r\nto speak about it.  Wife o\' his\'n will never work away fra\' home."\r\n\r\n"I say it\'s Prince Albert as ought to be asked how he\'d like his\r\nmissis to be from home when he comes in, tired and worn, and wanting\r\nsome one to cheer him; and maybe, her to come in by-and-bye, just as\r\ntired and down in th\' mouth; and how he\'d like for her never to be\r\nat home to see to th\' cleaning of his house, or to keep a bright\r\nfire in his grate.  Let alone his meals being all hugger-mugger and\r\ncomfortless.  I\'d be bound, prince as he is, if his missis served\r\nhim so, he\'d be off to a gin-palace, or summut o\' that kind.  So why\r\ncan\'t he make a law again poor folks\' wives working in factories?"\r\n\r\nMary ventured to say that she thought the Queen and Prince Albert\r\ncould not make laws, but the answer was--\r\n\r\n"Pooh! don\'t tell me it\'s not the Queen as makes laws; and isn\'t she\r\nbound to obey Prince Albert?  And if he said they mustn\'t, why she\'d\r\nsay they mustn\'t, and then all folk would say, oh, no, we never\r\nshall do any such thing no more."\r\n\r\n"Jem\'s getten on rarely," said Alice, who had not heard her sister\'s\r\nlast burst of eloquence, and whose thoughts were still running on\r\nher nephew, and his various talents.  "He\'s found out summut about a\r\ncrank or tank, I forget rightly which it is, but th\' master\'s made\r\nhim foreman, and he all the while turning off hands; but he said he\r\ncould na part wi\' Jem, nohow.  He\'s good wage now; I tell him he\'ll\r\nbe thinking of marrying soon, and he deserves a right down good\r\nwife, that he does."\r\n\r\nMary went very red, and looked annoyed, although there was a secret\r\nspring of joy deep down in her heart, at hearing Jem so spoken of.\r\nBut his mother only saw the annoyed look, and was piqued\r\naccordingly.  She was not over and above desirous that her son\r\nshould marry.  His presence in the house seemed a relic of happier\r\ntimes, and she had some little jealousy of his future wife, whoever\r\nshe might be.  Still she could not bear any one not to feel\r\ngratified and flattered by Jem\'s preference, and full well she knew\r\nhow above all others he preferred Mary.  Now she had never thought\r\nMary good enough for Jem, and her late neglect in coming to see her\r\nstill rankled a little in her breast.  So she determined to invent a\r\nlittle, in order to do away with any idea Mary might have that Jem\r\nwould choose her for "his right down good wife," as Aunt Alice\r\ncalled it.\r\n\r\n"Ay, he\'ll be for taking a wife soon," and then, in a lower voice,\r\nas if confidentially, but really to prevent any contradiction or\r\nexplanation from her simple sister-in-law, she added--\r\n\r\n"It\'ll not be long afore Molly Gibson (that\'s her at th\' provision\r\nshop round the corner) will hear a secret as will not displease her,\r\nI\'m thinking.  She\'s been casting sheep\'s eyes at our Jem this many\r\na day, but he thought her father would not give her to a common\r\nworking-man; but now he\'s good as her, every bit.  I thought once\r\nhe\'d a fancy for thee, Mary, but I donnot think yo\'d ever ha\'\r\nsuited, so it\'s best as it is."\r\n\r\nBy an effort Mary managed to keep down her vexation, and to say,\r\n"She hoped he\'d be happy with Molly Gibson.  She was very handsome,\r\nfor certain."\r\n\r\n"Ay, and a notable body, too.  I\'ll just step upstairs and show you\r\nthe patchwork quilt she gave me but last Saturday."\r\n\r\nMary was glad she was going out of the room.  Her words irritated\r\nher; perhaps not the less because she did not fully believe them.\r\nBesides, she wanted to speak to Alice, and Mrs. Wilson seemed to\r\nthink that she, as the widow, ought to absorb all the attention.\r\n\r\n"Dear Alice," began Mary, "I\'m so grieved to find you so deaf; it\r\nmust have come on very rapid."\r\n\r\n"Yes, dear, it\'s a trial; I\'ll not deny it.  Pray God give me\r\nstrength to find out its teaching.  I felt it sore one fine day when\r\nI thought I\'d go gather some meadow-sweet to make tea for Jane\'s\r\ncough; and the fields seemed so dree and still, and at first I could\r\nna make out what was wanting; and then it struck me it were th\' song\r\no\' the birds, and that I never should hear their sweet music no\r\nmore, and I could na help crying a bit.  But I\'ve much to be\r\nthankful for.  I think I\'m a comfort to Jane, if I\'m only some one\r\nto scold now and then; poor body!  It takes off her thoughts from\r\nher sore losses when she can scold a bit.  If my eyes are left I can\r\ndo well enough; I can guess at what folk are saying."\r\n\r\nThe splendid red and yellow patch quilt now made its appearance, and\r\nJane Wilson would not be satisfied unless Mary praised it all over,\r\nborder, centre, and ground-work, right side and wrong; and Mary did\r\nher duty, saying all the more, because she could not work herself up\r\nto any very hearty admiration of her rival\'s present.  She made\r\nhaste, however, with her commendations, in order to avoid\r\nencountering Jem.  As soon as she was fairly away from the house and\r\nstreet, she slackened her pace, and began to think.  Did Jem really\r\ncare for Molly Gibson?  Well, if he did, let him.  People seemed all\r\nto think he was much too good for her (Mary\'s own self).  Perhaps\r\nsome one else, far more handsome, and far more grand, would show him\r\none day that she was good enough to be Mrs. Henry Carson.  So\r\ntemper, or what Mary called "spirit," led her to encourage Mr.\r\nCarson more than ever she had done before.\r\n\r\nSome weeks after this there was a meeting of the Trades\' Union to\r\nwhich John Barton belonged.  The morning of the day on which it was\r\nto take place he had lain late in bed, for what was the use of\r\ngetting up?  He had hesitated between the purchase of meal or opium,\r\nand had chosen the latter, for its use had become a necessity with\r\nhim.  He wanted it to relieve him from the terrible depression its\r\nabsence occasioned.  A large lump seemed only to bring him into a\r\nnatural state, or what had been his natural state formerly.  Eight\r\no\'clock was the hour fixed for the meeting; and at it were read\r\nletters, filled with details of woe, from all parts of the country.\r\nFierce, heavy gloom brooded over the assembly; and fiercely and\r\nheavily did the men separate, towards eleven o\'clock, some irritated\r\nby the opposition of others to their desperate plans.\r\n\r\nIt was not a night to cheer them, as they quitted the glare of the\r\ngas-lighted room, and came out into the street.  Unceasing, soaking\r\nrain was falling; the very lamps seemed obscured by the damp upon\r\nthe glass, and their light reached but to a little distance from the\r\nposts.  The streets were cleared of passers-by; not a creature\r\nseemed stirring, except here and there a drenched policeman in his\r\noilskin cape.  Barton wished the others good-night, and set off\r\nhome.  He had gone through a street or two, when he heard a step\r\nbehind him; but he did not care to stop and see who it was.  A\r\nlittle further, and the person quickened step, and touched his arm\r\nvery lightly.  He turned, and saw, even by the darkness visible of\r\nthat badly-lighted street, that the woman who stood by him was of no\r\ndoubtful profession.  It was told by her faded finery, all unfit to\r\nmeet the pelting of that pitiless storm; the gauze bonnet, once\r\npink, now dirty white; the muslin gown, all draggled, and soaking\r\nwet up to the very knees; the gay-coloured barege shawl, closely\r\nwrapped round the form, which yet shivered and shook, as the woman\r\nwhispered, "I want to speak to you."\r\n\r\nHe swore an oath, and bade her begone.\r\n\r\n"I really do.  Don\'t send me away.  I\'m so out of breath, I cannot\r\nsay what I would all at once."  She put her hand to her side, and\r\ncaught her breath with evident pain.\r\n\r\n"I tell thee I\'m not the man for thee," adding an opprobrious name.\r\n"Stay," said he, as a thought suggested by her voice flashed across\r\nhim.  He gripped her arm--the arm he had just before shaken off--and\r\ndragged her, faintly resisting, to the nearest lamp-post.  He pushed\r\nthe bonnet back, and roughly held the face she would fain have\r\naverted, to the light, and in her large, unnaturally bright grey\r\neyes, her lovely mouth, half open, as if imploring the forbearance\r\nshe could not ask for in words, he saw at once the long-lost Esther;\r\nshe who had caused his wife\'s death.  Much was like the gay creature\r\nof former years; but the glaring paint, the sharp features, the\r\nchanged expression of the whole!  But most of all, he loathed the\r\ndress; and yet the poor thing, out of her little choice of attire,\r\nhad put on the plainest she had, to come on that night\'s errand.\r\n\r\n"So it\'s thee, is it?  It\'s thee!" exclaimed John, as he ground his\r\nteeth, and shook her with passion.  "I\'ve looked for thee long at\r\ncorners o\' streets, and such like places.  I knew I should find thee\r\nat last.  Thee\'ll maybe bethink thee o\' some words I spoke, which\r\nput thee up at th\' time; summut about street-walkers; but oh no!\r\nthou art none o\' them naughts; no one thinks thou art, who sees thy\r\nfine draggle-tailed dress, and thy pretty pink cheeks!" stopping for\r\nvery want of breath.\r\n\r\n"Oh, mercy! John, mercy! listen to me for Mary\'s sake!"\r\n\r\nShe meant his daughter, but the name only fell on his ear as\r\nbelonging to his wife; and it was adding fuel to the fire.  In vain\r\ndid her face grow deadly pale around the vivid circle of paint, in\r\nvain did she gasp for mercy,--he burst forth again.\r\n\r\n"And thou names that name to me? and thou thinks the thought of her\r\nwill bring thee mercy!  Dost thou know it was thee who killed her,\r\nas sure as ever Cain killed Abel.  She\'d loved thee as her own, and\r\nshe trusted thee as her own, and when thou wert gone she never held\r\nhead up again, but died in less than a three week; and at her\r\njudgment-day she\'ll rise, and point to thee as her murderer; or if\r\nshe don\'t, I will."\r\n\r\nHe flung her, trembling, sinking, fainting, from him, and strode\r\naway.  She fell with a feeble scream against the lamp-post, and lay\r\nthere in her weakness, unable to rise.  A policeman came up in time\r\nto see the close of these occurrences, and concluding from Esther\'s\r\nunsteady, reeling fall, that she was tipsy, he took her in her half-\r\nunconscious state to the lock-ups for the night.  The superintendent\r\nof that abode of vice and misery was roused from his dozing watch\r\nthrough the dark hours, by half-delirious wails and moanings, which\r\nhe reported as arising from intoxication.  If he had listened, he\r\nwould have heard these words, repeated in various forms, but always\r\nin the same anxious, muttering way--\r\n\r\n"He would not listen to me; what can I do?  He would not listen to\r\nme, and I wanted to warn him!  Oh, what shall I do to save Mary\'s\r\nchild!  What shall I do?  How can I keep her from being such a one\r\nas I am; such a wretched, loathsome creature!  She was listening\r\njust as I listened, and loving just as I loved, and the end will be\r\njust like my end.  How shall I save her?  She won\'t hearken to\r\nwarning, or heed it more than I did: and who loves her well enough\r\nto watch over her as she should be watched?  God keep her from harm!\r\nAnd yet I won\'t pray for her; sinner that I am!  Can my prayers be\r\nheard?  No! they\'ll only do harm.  How shall I save her?  He would\r\nnot listen to me."\r\n\r\nSo the night wore away.  The next morning she was taken up to the\r\nNew Bailey.  It was a clear case of disorderly vagrancy, and she was\r\ncommitted to prison for a month.  How much might happen in that\r\ntime!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI.   MR. CARSON\'S INTENTIONS REVEALED.\r\n\r\n     "O Mary, canst thou wreck his peace,\r\n        Wha for thy sake wad gladly die?\r\n      Or canst thou break that heart of his,\r\n        Whase only fault is loving thee?"\r\n                           --BURNS.\r\n\r\n     "I can like of the wealth, I must confess,\r\n      Yet more I prize the man though moneyless:\r\n      I am not of their humour yet that can\r\n      For title or estate affect a man;\r\n      Or of myself one body deign to make\r\n      With him I loathe, for his possessions\' sake."\r\n                           --WITHER\'S Fidelia.\r\n\r\nBarton returned home after his encounter with Esther, uneasy  and\r\ndissatisfied.  He had said no more than he had been planning to say\r\nfor years, in case she was ever thrown in his way, in the character\r\nin which he felt certain he should meet her.  He believed she\r\ndeserved it all, and yet he now wished he had not said it.  Her\r\nlook, as she asked for mercy, haunted him through his broken and\r\ndisordered sleep; her form, as he last saw her, lying prostrate in\r\nhelplessness, would not be banished from his dreams.  He sat up in\r\nbed to try and dispel the vision.  Now, too late, his conscience\r\nsmote him with harshness.  It would have been all very well, he\r\nthought, to have said what he did, if he had added some kind words,\r\nat last.  He wondered if his dead wife was conscious of that night\'s\r\noccurrence; and he hoped not, for with her love for Esther he\r\nbelieved it would embitter heaven to have seen her so degraded\r\nand repulsed.  For he now recalled her humility, her tacit\r\nacknowledgment of her lost character; and he began to marvel if\r\nthere was power in the religion he had often heard of, to turn her\r\nfrom her ways.  He felt that no earthly power that he knew of could\r\ndo it, but there glimmered on his darkness the idea that religion\r\nmight save her.  Still, where to find her again?  In the wilderness\r\nof a large town, where to meet with an individual of so little value\r\nor note to any?\r\n\r\nAnd evening after evening he paced the same streets in which he had\r\nheard those footsteps following him, peering under every fantastic,\r\ndiscreditable bonnet, in the hopes of once more meeting Esther, and\r\naddressing her in a far different manner from what he had done\r\nbefore.  But he returned, night after night, disappointed in his\r\nsearch, and at last gave it up in despair, and tried to recall his\r\nangry feelings towards her, in order to find relief from his present\r\nself-reproach.\r\n\r\nHe often looked at Mary, and wished she were not so like her aunt,\r\nfor the very bodily likeness seemed to suggest the possibility of a\r\nsimilar likeness in their fate; and then this idea enraged his\r\nirritable mind, and he became suspicious and anxious about Mary\'s\r\nconduct.  Now hitherto she had been so remarkably free from all\r\ncontrol, and almost from all inquiry concerning her actions, that\r\nshe did not brook this change in her father\'s behaviour very well.\r\nJust when she was yielding more than ever to Mr. Carson\'s desire of\r\nfrequent meetings, it was hard to be so questioned concerning her\r\nhours of leaving off work, whether she had come straight home, etc.\r\nShe could not tell lies; though she could conceal much if she were\r\nnot questioned.  So she took refuge in obstinate silence, alleging\r\nas a reason for it her indignation at being so cross-examined.  This\r\ndid not add to the good feeling between father and daughter, and yet\r\nthey dearly loved each other; and in the minds of each, one\r\nprincipal reason for maintaining such behaviour as displeased the\r\nother, was the believing that this conduct would insure that\r\nperson\'s happiness.\r\n\r\nHer father now began to wish Mary was married.  Then this terrible\r\nsuperstitious fear suggested by her likeness to Esther would be done\r\naway with.  He felt that he could not resume the reins he had once\r\nslackened.  But with a husband it would be different.  If Jem Wilson\r\nwould but marry her!  With his character for steadiness and talent!\r\nBut he was afraid Mary had slighted him, he came so seldom now to\r\nthe house.  He would ask her.\r\n\r\n"Mary, what\'s come o\'er thee and Jem Wilson?  You were great friends\r\nat one time."\r\n\r\n"Oh, folk say he is going to be married to Molly Gibson, and of\r\ncourse courting takes up a deal o\' time," answered Mary, as\r\nindifferently as she could.\r\n\r\n"Thou\'st played thy cards badly, then," replied her father, in a\r\nsurly tone.  "At one time he were desperate fond o\' thee, or I\'m\r\nmuch mistaken.  Much fonder of thee than thou deservedst."\r\n\r\n"That\'s as people think," said Mary pertly, for she remembered that\r\nthe very morning before she had met Mr. Carson, who had sighed, and\r\nswore, and protested all manner of tender vows that she was the\r\nloveliest, sweetest, best, etc.  And when she had seen him\r\nafterwards riding with one of his beautiful sisters, had he not\r\nevidently pointed her out as in some way or other an object worthy\r\nof attention and interest, and then lingered behind his sister\'s\r\nhorse for a moment to kiss his hand repeatedly.  So, as for Jem\r\nWilson, she could whistle him down the wind.\r\n\r\nBut her father was not in the mood to put up with pertness, and he\r\nupbraided her with the loss of Jem Wilson till she had to bite her\r\nlips till the blood came, in order to keep down the angry words that\r\nwould rise in her heart.  At last her father left the house, and\r\nthen she might give way to her passionate tears.\r\n\r\nIt so happened that Jem, after much anxious thought, had determined\r\nthat day to "put his fortune to the touch, to win or lose all."  He\r\nwas in a condition to maintain a wife in comfort.  It was true his\r\nmother and aunt must form part of the household: but such is not\r\nan uncommon case among the poor, and if there were the advantages of\r\nprevious friendship between the parties, it was not, he thought, an\r\nobstacle to matrimony.  Both mother and aunt, he believed, would\r\nwelcome Mary.  And, oh! what a certainty of happiness the idea of\r\nthat welcome implied.\r\n\r\nHe had been absent and abstracted all day long with the thought of\r\nthe coming event of the evening.  He almost smiled at himself for\r\nhis care in washing and dressing in preparation for his visit to\r\nMary; as if one waistcoat or another could decide his fate in so\r\npassionately a momentous thing.  He believed he only delayed before\r\nhis little looking-glass for cowardice, for absolute fear of a girl.\r\nHe would try not to think so much about the affair, and he thought\r\nthe more.\r\n\r\nPoor Jem! it is not an auspicious moment for thee!\r\n\r\n"Come in," said Mary, as some one knocked at the door, while she sat\r\nsadly at her sewing, trying to earn a few pence by working over\r\nhours at some mourning.\r\n\r\nJem entered, looking more awkward and abashed than he had ever done\r\nbefore.  Yet here was Mary all alone, just as he had hoped to find\r\nher.  She did not ask him to take a chair, but after standing a\r\nminute or two he sat down near her.\r\n\r\n"Is your father at home, Mary?" said he, by way of making an\r\nopening, for she seemed determined to keep silence, and went on\r\nstitching away.\r\n\r\n"No, he\'s gone to his Union, I suppose."  Another silence.  It was\r\nno use waiting, thought Jem.  The subject would never be led to by\r\nany talk he could think of in his anxious, fluttered state.  He had\r\nbetter begin at once.\r\n\r\n"Mary!" said he, and the unusual tone of his voice made her look up\r\nfor an instant, but in that time she understood from his countenance\r\nwhat was coming, and her heart beat so suddenly and violently she\r\ncould hardly sit still.  Yet one thing she was sure of; nothing he\r\ncould say should make her have him.  She would show them all WHO\r\nwould be glad to have her.  She was not yet calm after her father\'s\r\nirritating speeches.  Yet her eyes fell veiled before that\r\npassionate look fixed upon her.\r\n\r\n"Dear Mary! (for how dear you are, I cannot rightly tell you in\r\nwords.)  It\'s no new story I\'m going to speak about.  You must ha\'\r\nseen and known it long; for since we were boy and girl I ha\' loved\r\nyou above father and mother and all; and all I\'ve thought on by day\r\nand dreamt on by night has been something in which you\'ve had a\r\nshare.  I\'d no way of keeping you for long, and I scorned to try and\r\ntie you down; and I lived in terror lest some one else should take\r\nyou to himself.  But now, Mary, I\'m foreman in th\' works, and, dear\r\nMary! listen," as she, in her unbearable agitation, stood up and\r\nturned away from him.  He rose too, and came nearer, trying to take\r\nhold of her hand; but this she would not allow.  She was bracing\r\nherself up to refuse him, for once and for all.\r\n\r\n"And now, Mary, I\'ve a home to offer you, and a heart as true as\r\never man had to love you and cherish you; we shall never be rich\r\nfolk, I dare say; but if a loving heart and a strong right arm can\r\nshield you from sorrow, or from want, mine shall do it.  I cannot\r\nspeak as I would like; my love won\'t let itself be put in words.\r\nBut, oh! darling, say you\'ll believe me, and that you\'ll be mine."\r\n\r\nShe could not speak at once; her words would not come.\r\n\r\n"Mary, they say silence gives consent; is it so?" he whispered.\r\n\r\nNow or never the effort must be made.\r\n\r\n"No! it does not with me."  Her voice was calm, although she\r\ntrembled from head to foot.  "I will always be your friend, Jem, but\r\nI can never be your wife."\r\n\r\n"Not my wife?" said he mournfully.  "O Mary, think awhile! you\r\ncannot be my friend if you will not be my wife.  At least, I can\r\nnever be content to be only your friend.  Do think awhile!  If you\r\nsay No, you will make me hopeless, desperate.  It\'s no love of\r\nyesterday.  It has made the very groundwork of all that people call\r\ngood in me.  I don\'t know what I shall be if you won\'t have me.\r\nAnd, Mary, think how glad your father would be!  It may sound vain,\r\nbut he\'s told me more than once how much he should like to see us\r\ntwo married."\r\n\r\nJem intended this for a powerful argument, but in Mary\'s present\r\nmood it told against him more than anything; for it suggested the\r\nfalse and foolish idea that her father, in his evident anxiety to\r\npromote her marriage with Jem, had been speaking to him on the\r\nsubject with some degree of solicitation.\r\n\r\n"I tell you, Jem, it cannot be.  Once for all, I will never marry\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"And is this the end of all my hopes and fears? the end of my life,\r\nI may say, for it is the end of all worth living for!"  His\r\nagitation rose and carried him into passion.  "Mary, you\'ll hear,\r\nmaybe, of me as a drunkard, and maybe as a thief, and maybe as a\r\nmurderer.  Remember! when all are speaking ill of me, you will have\r\nno right to blame me, for it\'s your cruelty that will have made me\r\nwhat I feel I shall become.  You won\'t even say you\'ll try and like\r\nme; will you, Mary?" said he, suddenly changing his tone from\r\nthreatening despair to fond, passionate entreaty, as he took her\r\nhand and held it forcibly between both of his, while he tried to\r\ncatch a glimpse of her averted face.  She was silent, but it was\r\nfrom deep and violent emotion.  He could not bear to wait; he would\r\nnot hope, to be dashed away again; he rather in his bitterness of\r\nheart chose the certainty of despair, and before she could resolve\r\nwhat to answer, he flung away her hand and rushed out of the house.\r\n\r\n"Jem! Jem!" cried she, with faint and choking voice.  It was too\r\nlate; he left street after street behind him with his almost winged\r\nspeed, as he sought the fields, where he might give way unobserved\r\nto all the deep despair he felt.\r\n\r\nIt was scarcely ten minutes since he had entered the house, and\r\nfound Mary at comparative peace, and now she lay half across the\r\ndresser, her head hidden in her hands, and every part of her body\r\nshaking with the violence of her sobs.  She could not have told at\r\nfirst (if you had asked her, and she could have commanded voice\r\nenough to answer) why she was in such agonized grief.  It was too\r\nsudden for her to analyse, or think upon it.  She only felt that by\r\nher own doing her life would be hereafter blank and dreary.  By-\r\nand-bye her sorrow exhausted her body by its power, and she seemed\r\nto have no strength left for crying.  She sat down; and now thoughts\r\ncrowded on her mind.  One little hour ago, and all was still unsaid,\r\nand she had her fate in her own power.  And yet, how long ago had\r\nshe determined to say pretty much what she did, if the occasion ever\r\noffered.\r\n\r\nIt was as if two people were arguing the matter; that mournful\r\ndesponding communion between her former self, and her present self.\r\nHerself, a day, an hour ago; and herself now.  For we have every one\r\nof us felt how a very few minutes of the months and years called\r\nlife, will sometimes suffice to place all time past and future in an\r\nentirely new light; will make us see the vanity or the criminality\r\nof the bygone, and so change the aspect of the coming time that we\r\nlook with loathing on the very thing we have most desired.  A few\r\nmoments may change our character for life, by giving a totally\r\ndifferent direction to our aims and energies.\r\n\r\nTo return to Mary.  Her plan had been, as we well know, to marry Mr.\r\nCarson, and the occurrence an hour ago was only a preliminary step.\r\nTrue; but it had unveiled her heart to her; it had convinced her\r\nthat she loved Jem above all persons or things.  But Jem was a poor\r\nmechanic, with a mother and aunt to keep; a mother, too, who had\r\nshown her pretty clearly that she did not desire her for a\r\ndaughter-in-law: while Mr. Carson was rich, and prosperous, and\r\ngay, and (she believed) would place her in all circumstances of ease\r\nand luxury, where want could never come.  What were these hollow\r\nvanities to her, now she had discovered the passionate secret of her\r\nsoul?  She felt as if she almost hated Mr. Carson, who had decoyed\r\nher with his baubles.  She now saw how vain, how nothing to her,\r\nwould be all gaieties and pomps, all joys and pleasures, unless she\r\nmight share them with Jem; yes, with him she had harshly rejected so\r\nshort a time ago.  If he were poor, she loved him all the better.\r\nIf his mother did think her unworthy of him, what was it but the\r\ntruth? as she now owned with bitter penitence.  She had hitherto\r\nbeen walking in grope-light towards a precipice; but in the clear\r\nrevelation of that past hour she saw her danger, and turned away\r\nresolutely and for ever.\r\n\r\nThat was some comfort: I mean her clear perception of what she\r\nought not to do; of what no luring temptation should ever again\r\ninduce her to hearken to.  How she could best undo the wrong she had\r\ndone to Jem and herself by refusing his love was another anxious\r\nquestion.  She wearied herself by proposing plans, and rejecting\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nShe was roused to a consciousness of time by hearing the\r\nneighbouring church clock strike twelve.  Her father she knew might\r\nbe expected home any minute, and she was in no mood for a meeting\r\nwith him.  So she hastily gathered up her work, and went to her own\r\nlittle bedroom, leaving him to let himself in.\r\n\r\nShe put out her candle, that her father might not see its light\r\nunder the door; and sat down on her bed to think.  But again,\r\nturning things over in her mind again and again, she could only\r\ndetermine at once to put an end to all further communication with\r\nMr. Carson, in the most decided way she could.  Maidenly modesty\r\n(and true love is ever modest) seemed to oppose every plan she could\r\nthink of, for showing Jem how much she repented her decision against\r\nhim, and how dearly she had now discovered that she loved him.  She\r\ncame to the unusual wisdom of resolving to do nothing, but strive to\r\nbe patient, and improve circumstances as they might turn up.\r\nSurely, if Jem knew of her remaining unmarried, he would try his\r\nfortune again.  He would never be content with one rejection; she\r\nbelieved she could not in his place.  She had been very wrong, but\r\nnow she would endeavour to do right, and have womanly patience,\r\nuntil he saw her changed and repentant mind in her natural actions.\r\nEven if she had to wait for years, it was no more than now it was\r\neasy to look forward to, as a penance for her giddy flirting on the\r\none hand, and her cruel mistake concerning her feelings on the\r\nother.  So anticipating a happy ending in the course of her love,\r\nhowever distant it might be, she fell asleep just as the earliest\r\nfactory bells were ringing.  She had sunk down in her clothes, and\r\nher sleep was unrefreshing.  She wakened up shivery and chill in\r\nbody, and sorrow-stricken in mind, though she could not at first\r\nrightly tell the cause of her depression.\r\n\r\nShe recalled the events of the night before, and still resolved to\r\nadhere to the determinations she had then formed.  But patience\r\nseemed a far more difficult virtue this morning.\r\n\r\nShe hastened downstairs, and in her earnest, sad desire to do right,\r\nnow took much pains to secure a comfortable though scanty breakfast\r\nfor her father; and when he dawdled into the room, in an evidently\r\nirritable temper, she bore all with the gentleness of penitence,\r\ntill at last her mild answers turned away wrath.\r\n\r\nShe loathed the idea of meeting Sally Leadbitter at her daily work;\r\nyet it must be done, and she tried to nerve herself for the\r\nencounter, and to make it at once understood, that having determined\r\nto give up having anything further to do with Mr. Carson, she\r\nconsidered the bond of intimacy broken between them.\r\n\r\nBut Sally was not the person to let these resolutions be carried\r\ninto effect too easily.  She soon became aware of the present state\r\nof Mary\'s feelings, but she thought they merely arose from the\r\nchangeableness of girlhood, and that the time would come when Mary\r\nwould thank her for almost forcing her to keep up her meetings and\r\ncommunications with her rich lover.\r\n\r\nSo, when two days had passed over in rather too marked avoidance of\r\nSally on Mary\'s part, and when the former was made aware by Mr.\r\nCarson\'s complaints that Mary was not keeping her appointments with\r\nhim, and that unless he detained her by force, he had no chance of\r\nobtaining a word as she passed him in the street on her rapid walk\r\nhome, she resolved to compel Mary to what she called her own good.\r\n\r\nShe took no notice during the third day of Mary\'s avoidance as they\r\nsat at work; she rather seemed to acquiesce in the coolness of their\r\nintercourse.  She put away her sewing early, and went home to her\r\nmother, who, she said, was more ailing than usual.  The other girls\r\nsoon followed her example, and Mary, casting a rapid glance up and\r\ndown the street, as she stood last on Miss Simmonds\' doorstep,\r\ndarted homewards, in hopes of avoiding the person whom she was fast\r\nlearning to dread.  That night she was safe from any encounter on\r\nher road, and she arrived at home, which she found, as she expected,\r\nempty; for she knew it was a club night, which her father would not\r\nmiss.  She sat down to recover breath, and to still her heart, which\r\npanted more from nervousness than from over-exertion, although she\r\nhad walked so quickly.  Then she arose, and taking off her bonnet,\r\nher eye caught the form of Sally Leadbitter passing the window with\r\na lingering step, and looking into the darkness with all her might,\r\nas if to ascertain if Mary were returned.  In an instant she\r\nrepassed and knocked at the house-door; but without awaiting an\r\nanswer, she entered.\r\n\r\n"Well, Mary, dear" (knowing well how little "dear" Mary considered\r\nher just then); "it\'s so difficult to get any comfortable talk at\r\nMiss Simmonds\', I thought I\'d just step up and see you at home."\r\n\r\n"I understood, from what you said, your mother was ailing, and that\r\nyou wanted to be with her," replied Mary, in no welcoming tone.\r\n\r\n"Ay, but mother\'s better now," said the unabashed Sally.  "Your\r\nfather\'s out, I suppose?" looking round as well as she could; for\r\nMary made no haste to perform the hospitable offices of striking a\r\nmatch, and lighting a candle.\r\n\r\n"Yes, he\'s out," said Mary shortly, and busying herself at last\r\nabout the candle, without ever asking her visitor to sit down.\r\n\r\n"So much the better," answered Sally; "for to tell you the truth,\r\nMary, I\'ve a friend at th\' end of the road, as is anxious to come\r\nand see you at home, since you\'re grown so particular as not to like\r\nto speak to him in the street.  He\'ll be here directly."\r\n\r\n"O Sally, don\'t let him," said Mary, speaking at last heartily; and\r\nrunning to the door, she would have fastened it, but Sally held her\r\nhands, laughing meanwhile at her distress.\r\n\r\n"Oh, please, Sally," struggling, "dear Sally! don\'t let him come\r\nhere, the neighbours will so talk, and father\'ll go mad if he hears;\r\nhe\'ll kill me, Sally, he will.  Besides, I don\'t love him--I never\r\ndid.  Oh, let me go," as footsteps approached; and then, as they\r\npassed the house, and seemed to give her a respite, she continued,\r\n"Do, Sally, dear Sally, go and tell him I don\'t love him, and that I\r\ndon\'t want to have anything more to do with him.  It was very wrong,\r\nI dare say, keeping company with him at all, but I\'m very sorry, if\r\nI\'ve led him to think too much of me; and I don\'t want him to think\r\nany more.  Will you tell him this, Sally? and I\'ll do anything for\r\nyou, if you will."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell you what I\'ll do," said Sally, in a more relenting mood;\r\n"I\'ll go back with you to where he\'s waiting for us; or rather, I\r\nshould say, where I told him to wait for a quarter of an hour, till\r\nI seed if your father was at home; and if I didn\'t come back in that\r\ntime, he said he\'d come here, and break the door open but he\'d see\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Oh, let us go, let us go," said Mary, feeling that the interview\r\nmust be, and had better be anywhere than at home, where her father\r\nmight return at any minute.  She snatched up her bonnet, and was at\r\nthe end of the court in an instant; but then, not knowing whether to\r\nturn to the right or to the left, she was obliged to wait for Sally,\r\nwho came leisurely up, and put her arm through Mary\'s with a kind of\r\ndecided hold, intended to prevent the possibility of her changing\r\nher mind and turning back.  But this, under the circumstances, was\r\nquite different to Mary\'s plan.  She had wondered more than once if\r\nshe must not have another interview with Mr. Carson; and had then\r\ndetermined, while she expressed her resolution that it should be the\r\nfinal one, to tell him how sorry she was if she had thoughtlessly\r\ngiven him false hopes.  For, be it remembered, she had the\r\ninnocence, or the ignorance, to believe his intentions honourable;\r\nand he, feeling that at any price he must have her, only that he\r\nwould obtain her as cheaply as he could, had never undeceived her;\r\nwhile Sally Leadbitter laughed in her sleeve at them both, and\r\nwondered how it would all end--whether Mary would gain her point of\r\nmarriage, with her sly affectation of believing such to be Mr.\r\nCarson\'s intention in courting her.\r\n\r\nNot very far from the end of the street, into which the court where\r\nMary lived opened, they met Mr. Carson, his hat a good deal slouched\r\nover his face, as if afraid of being recognised.  He turned when he\r\nsaw them coming, and led the way without uttering a word (although\r\nthey were close behind) to a street of half-finished houses.\r\n\r\nThe length of the walk gave Mary time to recoil from the interview\r\nwhich was to follow; but even if her own resolve to go through with\r\nit had failed, there was the steady grasp of Sally Leadbitter, which\r\nshe could not evade without an absolute struggle.\r\n\r\nAt last he stopped in the shelter and concealment of a wooden fence,\r\nput up to keep the building rubbish from intruding on the foot-\r\npavement.  Inside this fence, a minute afterwards, the girls were\r\nstanding by him; Mary now returning Sally\'s detaining grasp with\r\ninterest, for she had determined on the way to make her a witness,\r\nwilling or unwilling, to the ensuing conversation.  But Sally\'s\r\ncuriosity led her to be a very passive prisoner in Mary\'s hold.\r\n\r\nWith more freedom than he had ever used before, Mr. Carson put his\r\narm firmly round Mary\'s waist, in spite of her indignant resistance.\r\n\r\n"Nay, nay! you little witch!  Now I have caught you, I shall keep\r\nyou prisoner.  Tell me now what has made you run away from me so\r\nfast these few days--tell me, you sweet little coquette!"\r\n\r\nMary ceased struggling, but turned so as to be almost opposite to\r\nhim, while she spoke out calmly and boldly--\r\n\r\n"Mr. Carson!  I want to speak to you for once and for all.  Since I\r\nmet you last Monday evening, I have made up my mind to have nothing\r\nmore to do with you.  I know I\'ve been wrong in leading you to think\r\nI liked you; but I believe I didn\'t rightly know my own mind; and I\r\nhumbly beg your pardon, sir, if I\'ve led you to think too much of\r\nme."\r\n\r\nFor an instant he was surprised; the next, vanity came to his aid,\r\nand convinced him that she could only be joking.  He, young,\r\nagreeable, rich, handsome!  No! she was only showing a little\r\nwomanly fondness for coquetting.\r\n\r\n"You\'re a darling little rascal to go on in this way!  \'Humbly\r\nbegging my pardon if you\'ve made me think too much of you.\'  As if\r\nyou didn\'t know I think of you from morning till night.  But you\r\nwant to be told it again and again, do you?"\r\n\r\n"No, indeed, sir, I don\'t.  I would far liefer* that you should say\r\nyou would never think of me again, than that you should speak of me\r\nin this way.  For, indeed, sir, I never was more in earnest than I\r\nam, when I say to-night is the last night I will ever speak to you."\r\n\r\n     *Liefer; rather.\r\n              "Yet had I LEVRE unwist for sorrow die."\r\n                       --CHAUCER, Troilus and Creseide.\r\n\r\n"Last night, you sweet little equivocator, but not last day.  Ha,\r\nMary, I\'ve caught you, have I?" as she, puzzled by his perseverance\r\nin thinking her joking, hesitated in what form she could now put her\r\nmeaning.\r\n\r\n"I mean, sir," she said sharply, "that I will never speak to you\r\nagain, at any time, after to-night."\r\n\r\n"And what\'s made this change, Mary?" said he, seriously enough now.\r\n"Have I done anything to offend you?" added he earnestly.\r\n\r\n"No, sir," she answered gently, but yet firmly.  "I cannot tell you\r\nexactly why I\'ve changed my mind; but I shall not alter it again;\r\nand, as I said before, I beg your pardon if I\'ve done wrong by you.\r\nAnd now sir, if you please, good-night."\r\n\r\n"But I do not please.  You shall not go.  What have I done, Mary?\r\nTell me.  You must not go without telling me how I have vexed you.\r\nWhat would you have me do?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing, sir, but" (in an agitated tone), "oh! let me go!  You\r\ncannot change my mind; it\'s quite made up.  Oh, sir! why do you hold\r\nme so tight?  If you WILL know why I won\'t have anything more to do\r\nwith you, it is that I cannot love you.  I have tried, and I really\r\ncannot."\r\n\r\nThis naive and candid avowal served her but little.  He could not\r\nunderstand how it could be true.  Some reason lurked behind.  He was\r\npassionately in love.  What should he do to tempt her?  A thought\r\nstruck him.\r\n\r\n"Listen! Mary.  Nay, I cannot let you go till you have heard me.  I\r\ndo love you dearly; and I won\'t believe but what you love me a very\r\nlittle, just a very little.  Well, if you don\'t like to own it,\r\nnever mind!  I only want now to tell you how much I love you, by\r\nwhat I am ready to give up for you.  You know (or perhaps you are\r\nnot fully aware) how little my father and mother would like me to\r\nmarry you.  So angry would they be, and so much ridicule should I\r\nhave to brave, that of course I have never thought of it till now.\r\nI thought we could be happy enough without marriage."  (Deep sank\r\nthose words into Mary\'s heart.)  "But now, if you like, I\'ll get a\r\nlicence to-morrow morning--nay, to-night, and I\'ll marry you in\r\ndefiance of all the world, rather than give you up.  In a year or\r\ntwo my father will forgive me, and meanwhile you shall have every\r\nluxury money can purchase, and every charm that love can devise to\r\nmake your life happy.  After all, my mother was but a factory girl."\r\n(This was said to himself, as if to reconcile himself to this bold\r\nstep.)  "Now, Mary, you see how willing I am to--to sacrifice a good\r\ndeal for you; I even offer you marriage, to satisfy your little\r\nambitious heart; so now, won\'t you say, you can love me a little,\r\nlittle bit?"\r\n\r\nHe pulled her towards him.  To his surprise, she still resisted.\r\nYes! though all she had pictured to herself for so many months in\r\nbeing the wife of Mr. Carson was now within her grasp, she resisted.\r\nHis speech had given her but one feeling, that of exceeding great\r\nrelief.  For she had dreaded, now she knew what true love was, to\r\nthink of the attachment she might have created; the deep feeling her\r\nflirting conduct might have called out.  She had loaded herself with\r\nreproaches for the misery she might have caused.  It was a relief to\r\ngather that the attachment was of that low despicable kind which can\r\nplan to seduce the object of its affection; that the feeling she had\r\ncaused was shallow enough, for it only pretended to embrace self, at\r\nthe expense of the misery, the ruin, of one falsely termed beloved.\r\nShe need not be penitent to such a plotter! that was the relief.\r\n\r\n"I am obliged to you, sir, for telling me what you have.  You may\r\nthink I am a fool; but I did think you meant to marry me all along;\r\nand yet, thinking so, I felt I could not love you.  Still I felt\r\nsorry I had gone so far in keeping company with you.  Now, sir, I\r\ntell you, if I had loved you before, I don\'t think I should have\r\nloved you now you have told me you meant to ruin me; for that\'s the\r\nplain English of not meaning to marry me till just this minute.  I\r\nsaid I was sorry, and humbly begged your pardon; that was before I\r\nknew what you were.  Now I scorn you, sir, for plotting to ruin a\r\npoor girl.  Goodnight."\r\n\r\nAnd with a wrench, for which she had reserved all her strength, she\r\nflew off like a bolt.  They heard her flying footsteps echo down the\r\nquiet street.  The next sound was Sally\'s laugh, which grated on Mr.\r\nCarson\'s ears, and keenly irritated him.\r\n\r\n"And what do you find so amusing, Sally?" asked he.\r\n\r\n"Oh, sir, I beg your pardon.  I humbly beg your pardon, as Mary\r\nsays, but I can\'t help laughing to think how she\'s outwitted us."\r\n(She was going to have said, "outwitted you," but changed the\r\npronoun.)\r\n\r\n"Why, Sally, had you any idea she was going to fly out in this\r\nstyle?"\r\n\r\n"No, I hadn\'t, to be sure.  But if you did think of marrying her,\r\nwhy (if I may be so bold as to ask) did you go and tell her you had\r\nno thought of doing otherwise by her?  That was what put her up at\r\nlast!"\r\n\r\n"Why, I had repeatedly before led her to infer that marriage was not\r\nmy object.  I never dreamed she could have been so foolish as to\r\nhave mistaken me, little provoking romancer though she be!  So I\r\nnaturally wished her to know what a sacrifice of prejudice, of--of\r\nmyself, in short, I was willing to make for her sake; yet I don\'t\r\nthink she was aware of it after all.  I believe I might have any\r\nlady in Manchester if I liked, and yet I was willing and ready to\r\nmarry a poor dressmaker.  Don\'t you understand me now? and don\'t you\r\nsee what a sacrifice I was making to humour her? and all to no\r\navail."\r\n\r\nSally was silent, so he went on--\r\n\r\n"My father would have forgiven any temporary connection, far sooner\r\nthan my marrying one so far beneath me in rank."\r\n\r\n"I thought you said, sir, your mother was a factory girl," remarked\r\nSally rather maliciously.\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes!--but then my father was in much such a station; at any\r\nrate, there was not the disparity there is between Mary and me."\r\n\r\nAnother pause.\r\n\r\n"Then you mean to give her up, sir?  She made no bones of saying she\r\ngave you up."\r\n\r\n"No; I do not mean to give her up, whatever you and she may please\r\nto think.  I am more in love with her than ever; even for this\r\ncharming capricious ebullition of hers.  She\'ll come round, you may\r\ndepend upon it.  Women always do.  They always have second thoughts,\r\nand find out that they are best in casting off a lover.  Mind, I\r\ndon\'t say I shall offer her the same terms again."\r\n\r\nWith a few more words of no importance, the allies parted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII.   OLD ALICE\'S BAIRN,\r\n\r\n     "I lov\'d him not; and yet now he is gone,\r\n            I feel I am alone.\r\n      I check\'d him while he spoke; yet could he speak,\r\n            Alas! I would not check.\r\n      For reasons not to love him once I sought,\r\n            And wearied all my thought."--W. S. LANDOR.\r\n\r\nAnd now Mary had, as she thought, dismissed both her lovers.  But\r\nthey looked on their dismissals with very different eyes.  He who\r\nloved her with all his heart and with all his soul, considered his\r\nrejection final.  He did not comfort himself with the idea, which\r\nwould have proved so well founded in his case, that women have\r\nsecond thoughts about casting off their lovers.  He had too much\r\nrespect for his own heartiness of love to believe himself unworthy\r\nof Mary; that mock humble conceit did not enter his head.  He\r\nthought he did not "hit Mary\'s fancy"; and though that may sound a\r\ntrivial every-day expression, yet the reality of it cut him to the\r\nheart.  Wild visions of enlistment, of drinking himself into\r\nforgetfulness, of becoming desperate in some way or another, entered\r\nhis mind; but then the thought of his mother stood like an angel\r\nwith a drawn sword in the way to sin.  For, you know, "he was the\r\nonly son of his mother, and she was a widow"; dependent on him for\r\ndaily bread.  So he could not squander away health and time, which\r\nwere to him money wherewith to support her failing years.  He went\r\nto his work, accordingly, to all outward semblance just as usual;\r\nbut with a heavy, heavy heart within.\r\n\r\nMr. Carson, as we have seen, persevered in considering Mary\'s\r\nrejection of him as merely a "charming caprice."  If she were at\r\nwork, Sally Leadbitter was sure to slip a passionately loving note\r\ninto her hand, and then so skilfully move away from her side, that\r\nMary could not all at once return it, without making some sensation\r\namong the workwomen.  She was even forced to take several home with\r\nher.  But after reading one, she determined on her plan.  She made\r\nno great resistance to receiving them from Sally, but kept them\r\nunopened, and occasionally returned them in a blank half-sheet of\r\npaper.  But far worse than this, was the being so constantly waylaid\r\nas she went home by her persevering lover; who had been so long\r\nacquainted with all her habits, that she found it difficult to evade\r\nhim.  Late or early, she was never certain of being free from him.\r\nGo this way or that, he might come up some cross street when she had\r\njust congratulated herself on evading him for that day.  He could\r\nnot have taken a surer mode of making himself odious to her.\r\n\r\nAnd all this time Jem Wilson never came!  Not to see her--that she\r\ndid not expect--but to see her father; to--she did not know what,\r\nbut she had hoped he would have come on some excuse, just to see if\r\nshe hadn\'t changed her mind.  He never came.  Then she grew weary\r\nand impatient, and her spirits sank.  The persecution of the one\r\nlover, and the neglect of the other, oppressed her sorely.  She\r\ncould not now sit quietly through the evening at her work; or, if\r\nshe kept, by a strong effort, from pacing up and down the room, she\r\nfelt as if she must sing to keep off thought while she sewed.  And\r\nher songs were the maddest, merriest, she could think of.  "Barbara\r\nAllen," and such sorrowful ditties, did well enough for happy times;\r\nbut now she required all the aid that could be derived from external\r\nexcitement to keep down the impulse of grief.\r\n\r\nAnd her father, too--he was a great anxiety to her, he looked so\r\nchanged and so ill.  Yet he would not acknowledge to any ailment.\r\nShe knew, that be it as late as it would, she never left off work\r\nuntil (if the poor servants paid her pretty regularly for the odd\r\njobs of mending she did for them) she had earned a few pence, enough\r\nfor one good meal for her father on the next day.  But very\r\nfrequently all she could do in the morning, after her late sitting\r\nup at night, was to run with the work home, and receive the money\r\nfrom the person for whom it was done.  She could not stay often to\r\nmake purchases of food, but gave up the money at once to her\r\nfather\'s eager clutch; sometimes prompted by a savage hunger it is\r\ntrue, but more frequently by a craving for opium.\r\n\r\nOn the whole he was not so hungry as his daughter.  For it was a\r\nlong fast from the one o\'clock dinner hour at Miss Simmonds\' to the\r\nclose of Mary\'s vigil, which was often extended to midnight.  She\r\nwas young, and had not yet learned to bear "clemming."\r\n\r\nOne evening, as she sang a merry song over her work, stopping\r\noccasionally to sigh, the blind Margaret came groping in.  It had\r\nbeen one of Mary\'s additional sorrows that her friend had been\r\nabsent from home, accompanying the lecturer on music in his round\r\namong the manufacturing towns of Yorkshire and Lancashire.  Her\r\ngrandfather, too, had seen this a good time for going his\r\nexpeditions in search of specimens; so that the house had been shut\r\nup for several weeks.\r\n\r\n"O Margaret, Margaret! how glad I am to see you.  Take care.  There\r\nnow, you\'re all right, that\'s father\'s chair.  Sit down."--She\r\nkissed her over and over again.\r\n\r\n"It seems like the beginning o\' brighter times, to see you again,\r\nMargaret.  Bless you!  And how well you look!"\r\n\r\n"Doctors always send ailing folk for change of air: and you know\r\nI\'ve had plenty o\' that same lately."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve been quite a traveller for sure!  Tell us all about it, do,\r\nMargaret.  Where have you been to, first place?"\r\n\r\n"Eh, lass, that would take a long time to tell.  Half o\'er the\r\nworld, I sometimes think.  Bolton and Bury, and Owdham, and Halifax,\r\nand--but Mary, guess who I saw there?  Maybe you know, though, so\r\nit\'s not fair guessing."\r\n\r\n"No, I dunnot.  Tell me, Margaret, for I cannot abide waiting and\r\nguessing."\r\n\r\n"Well, one night as I were going fra\' my lodgings wi\' the help on a\r\nlad as belonged to th\' landlady, to find the room where I were to\r\nsing, I heard a cough before me, walking along.  Thinks I, that\'s\r\nJem Wilson\'s cough, or I\'m much mistaken.  Next time came a sneeze\r\nand cough, and then I were certain.  First I hesitated whether I\r\nshould speak, thinking if it were a stranger he\'d maybe think me\r\nforrard.*  But I knew blind folks must not be nesh about using their\r\ntongues, so says I, \'Jem Wilson, is that you?\'  And sure enough it\r\nwas, and nobody else.  Did you know he were in Halifax, Mary?"\r\n\r\n     *Forrard; forward.\r\n\r\n"No," she answered, faintly and sadly; for Halifax was all the same\r\nto her heart as the Antipodes; equally inaccessible by humble\r\npenitent looks and maidenly tokens of love.\r\n\r\n"Well, he\'s there, however: he\'s putting up an engine for some\r\nfolks there, for his master.  He\'s doing well, for he\'s getten four\r\nor five men under him; we\'d two or three meetings, and he telled me\r\nall about his invention for doing away wi\' the crank, or somewhat.\r\nHis master\'s bought it from him, and ta\'en out a patent, and Jem\'s a\r\ngentleman for life wi\' the money his master gied him.  But you\'ll\r\nha\' heard all this, Mary?"\r\n\r\nNo! she had not.\r\n\r\n"Well, I thought it all happened afore he left Manchester, and then\r\nin course you\'d ha\' known.  But maybe it were all settled after he\r\ngot to Halifax; however, he\'s gotten two or three hunder pounds for\r\nhis invention.  But what\'s up with you, Mary? you\'re sadly out of\r\nsorts.  You\'ve never been quarrelling wi\' Jem, surely?"\r\n\r\nNow Mary cried outright; she was weak in body, and unhappy in mind,\r\nand the time was come when she might have the relief of telling her\r\ngrief.  She could not bring herself to confess how much of her\r\nsorrow was caused by her having been vain and foolish; she hoped\r\nthat need never be known, and she could not bear to think of it.\r\n\r\n"O Margaret! do you know Jem came here one night when I were put\r\nout, and cross.  Oh, dear! dear! I could bite my tongue out when I\r\nthink on it.  And he told me how he loved me, and I thought I did\r\nnot love him, and I told him I didn\'t; and, Margaret,--he believed\r\nme, and went away so sad, and so angry; and now, I\'d do anything--I\r\nwould indeed"; her sobs choked the end of her sentence.  Margaret\r\nlooked at her with sorrow, but with hope; for she had no doubt in\r\nher own mind, that it was only a temporary estrangement,\r\n\r\n"Tell me, Margaret," said Mary, taking her apron down from her eyes,\r\nand looking at Margaret with eager anxiety, "what can I do to bring\r\nhim back to me?  Should I write to him?"\r\n\r\n"No," replied her friend, "that would not do.  Men are so queer,\r\nthey like to have a\' the courting to themselves."\r\n\r\n"But I did not mean to write him a courting letter," said Mary,\r\nsomewhat indignantly.\r\n\r\n"If you wrote at all, it would be to give him a hint you\'d taken the\r\nrue, and would be very glad to have him now.  I believe now he\'d\r\nrather find that out himself."\r\n\r\n"But he won\'t try," said Mary, sighing.  "How can he find it out\r\nwhen he\'s at Halifax?"\r\n\r\n"If he\'s a will he\'s a way, depend upon it.  And you would not have\r\nhim if he\'s not a will to you, Mary!  No, dear!" changing her tone\r\nfrom the somewhat hard way in which sensible people too often speak,\r\nto the soft accents of tenderness which come with such peculiar\r\ngrace from them, "you must just wait and be patient.  You may depend\r\nupon it, all will end well, and better than if you meddled in it\r\nnow."\r\n\r\n"But it\'s so hard to be patient," pleaded Mary.\r\n\r\n"Ay, dear; being patient is the hardest work we, any of us, have to\r\ndo through life, I take it.  Waiting is far more difficult than\r\ndoing.  I\'ve known that about my sight, and many a one has known it\r\nin watching the sick; but it\'s one of God\'s lessons we all must\r\nlearn, one way or another."  After a pause--"Have ye been to see his\r\nmother of late?"\r\n\r\n"No; not for some weeks.  When last I went she was so frabbit* with\r\nme, that I really thought she wished I\'d keep away."\r\n\r\n     *Frabbit; ill-tempered.\r\n\r\n"Well! if I were you I\'d go.  Jem will hear on\'t, and it will do you\r\nfar more good in his mind than writing a letter, which, after all,\r\nyou would find a tough piece of work when you came to settle to it.\r\n\'T would be hard to say neither too much nor too little.  But I must\r\nbe going, grandfather is at home, and it\'s our first night together,\r\nand he must not be sitting wanting me any longer."\r\n\r\nShe rose up from her seat, but still delayed going.\r\n\r\n"Mary!  I\'ve somewhat else I want to say to you, and I don\'t rightly\r\nknow how to begin.  You see, grandfather and I know what bad times\r\nis, and we know your father is out of work, and I\'m getting more\r\nmoney than I can well manage; and, dear, would you just take this\r\nbit o\' gold, and pay me back in good times?"  The tears stood in\r\nMargaret\'s eyes as she spoke.\r\n\r\n"Dear Margaret, we\'re not so bad pressed as that."  (The thought of\r\nher father and his ill looks, and his one meal a day, rushed upon\r\nMary.)  "And yet, dear, if it would not put you out o\' your way--I\r\nwould work hard to make it up to you;--but would not your\r\ngrandfather be vexed?"\r\n\r\n"Not he, wench!  It were more his thought than mine, and we have\r\ngotten ever so many more at home, so don\'t hurry yourself about\r\npaying.  It\'s hard to be blind, to be sure, else money comes in so\r\neasily now to what it used to do; and it\'s downright pleasure to\r\nearn it, for I do so like singing."\r\n\r\n"I wish I could sing," said Mary, looking at the sovereign.\r\n\r\n"Some has one kind of gifts, and some another.  Many\'s the time when\r\nI could see, that I longed for your beauty, Mary!  We\'re like\r\nchilder, ever wanting what we han not got.  But now I must say just\r\none more word.  Remember, if you\'re sore pressed for money, we shall\r\ntake it very unkind if you donnot let us know.  Good-bye to ye."\r\n\r\nIn spite of her blindness she hurried away, anxious to rejoin her\r\ngrandfather, and desirous also to escape from Mary\'s expressions of\r\ngratitude.\r\n\r\nHer visit had done Mary good in many ways.  It had strengthened her\r\npatience and her hope; it had given her confidence in Margaret\'s\r\nsympathy; and last, and really least in comforting power (of so\r\nlittle value are silver and gold in comparison to love, that gift in\r\nevery one\'s power to bestow), came the consciousness of the\r\nmoney-value of the sovereign she held in her hand.  The many things\r\nit might purchase!  First of all came the thought of the comfortable\r\nsupper for her father that very night; and acting instantly upon the\r\nidea, she set off in hopes that all the provision shops might not\r\nyet be closed, although it was so late.\r\n\r\nThat night the cottage shone with unusual light and fire gleam; and\r\nthe father and daughter sat down to a meal they thought almost\r\nextravagant.  It was so long since they had had enough to eat.\r\n\r\n"Food gives heart," say the Lancashire people; and the next day Mary\r\nmade time to go and call on Mrs. Wilson, according to Margaret\'s\r\nadvice.  She found her quite alone, and more gracious than she had\r\nbeen the last time Mary had visited her.  Alice was gone out, she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n"She would just step up to the post-office, all for no earthly use.\r\nFor it were to ask if they hadn\'t a letter lying there for her from\r\nher foster-son, Will Wilson, the sailor-lad."\r\n\r\n"What made her think there were a letter?" asked Mary.\r\n\r\n"Why, yo see, a neighbour as has been in Liverpool, telled us Will\'s\r\nship were come in.  Now he said last time he were in Liverpool, he\'d\r\nha\' come to ha\' seen Alice, but his ship had but a week holiday, and\r\nhard work for the men in that time, too.  So Alice makes sure he\'ll\r\ncome this, and has had her hand behind her ear at every noise in th\'\r\nstreet, thinking it were him.  And to-day she were neither to have\r\nnor to hold, but off she would go to th\' post, and see if he had na\r\nsent her a line to th\' old house near yo.  I tried to get her to\r\ngive up going, for let alone her deafness she\'s getten so dark, she\r\ncannot see five yards afore her; but no, she would go, poor old\r\nbody."\r\n\r\n"I did not know her sight failed her; she used to have good eyes\r\nenough when she lived near us."\r\n\r\n"Ay, but it\'s gone lately a good deal.  But you never ask after Jem\r\n"--anxious to get in a word on the subject nearest her heart.\r\n\r\n"No," replied Mary, blushing scarlet.  "How is he?"\r\n\r\n"I cannot justly say how he is, seeing he\'s at Halifax; but he were\r\nvery well when he wrote last Tuesday.  Han ye heard o\' his good\r\nluck?"\r\n\r\nRather to her disappointment, Mary owned she had heard of the sum\r\nhis master had paid him for his invention.\r\n\r\n"Well! and did not Margaret tell you what he\'d done wi\' it?  It\'s\r\njust like him, though, ne\'er to say a word about it.  Why, when he\r\nwere paid, what does he do but get his master to help him to buy an\r\nincome for me and Alice.  He had her name put down for her life;\r\nbut, poor thing, she\'ll not be long to the fore, I\'m thinking.\r\nShe\'s sadly failed of late.  And so, Mary, yo see, we\'re two ladies\r\no\' property.  It\'s a matter o\' twenty pound a year, they tell me.  I\r\nwish the twins had lived, bless \'em," said she, dropping a few\r\ntears.  "They should ha\' had the best o\' schooling, and their\r\nbellyfuls o\' food.  I suppose they\'re better off in heaven, only I\r\nshould so like to see \'em."\r\n\r\nMary\'s heart filled with love at this new proof of Jem\'s goodness;\r\nbut she could not talk about it.  She took Jane Wilson\'s hand, and\r\npressed it with affection; and then turned the subject to Will, her\r\nsailor nephew.  Jane was a little bit sorry, but her prosperity had\r\nmade her gentler, and she did not resent what she felt at Mary\'s\r\nindifference to Jem and his merits.\r\n\r\n"He\'s been in Africa, and that neighbourhood, I believe.  He\'s a\r\nfine chap, but he\'s not getten Jem\'s hair.  His has too much o\' the\r\nred in it.  He sent Alice (but, maybe, she telled you) a matter o\'\r\nfive pound when he were over before: but that were nought to an\r\nincome, yo know."\r\n\r\n"It\'s not every one that can get a hundred or two at a time," said\r\nMary.\r\n\r\n"No! no! that\'s true enough.  There\'s not many a one like Jem.\r\nThat\'s Alice\'s step," said she, hastening to open the door to her\r\nsister-in-law.  Alice looked weary, and sad, and dusty.  The\r\nweariness and the dust would not have been noticed either by her, or\r\nthe others, if it had not been for the sadness.\r\n\r\n"No letters?" said Mrs. Wilson.\r\n\r\n"No, none!  I must just wait another day to hear fra\' my lad.  It\'s\r\nvery dree work, waiting," said Alice.\r\n\r\nMargaret\'s words came into Mary\'s mind.  Every one has their time\r\nand kind of waiting.\r\n\r\n"If I but knew he were safe, and not drowned!" spoke Alice.  "If I\r\nbut knew he WERE drowned, I would ask grace to say, Thy will be\r\ndone.  It\'s the waiting."\r\n\r\n"It\'s hard work to be patient to all of us," said Mary; "I know I\r\nfind it so, but I did not know one so good as you did, Alice; I\r\nshall not think so badly of myself for being a bit impatient, now\r\nI\'ve heard you say you find it difficult."\r\n\r\nThe idea of reproach to Alice was the last in Mary\'s mind; and Alice\r\nknew it was.  Nevertheless, she said--\r\n\r\n"Then, my dear, I beg your pardon, and God\'s pardon, too, if I\'ve\r\nweakened your faith, by showing you how feeble mine was.  Half our\r\nlife\'s spent in waiting, and it ill becomes one like me, wi\' so many\r\nmercies, to grumble.  I\'ll try and put a bridle o\'er my tongue, and\r\nmy thoughts too."  She spoke in a humble and gentle voice, like one\r\nasking forgiveness.\r\n\r\n"Come, Alice," interposed Mrs. Wilson, "don\'t fret yoursel for e\'er\r\na trifle wrong said here or there.  See! I\'ve put th\' kettle on, and\r\nyou and Mary shall ha\' a dish o\' tea in no time."\r\n\r\nSo she bustled about, and brought out a comfortable-looking\r\nsubstantial loaf, and set Mary to cut bread and butter, while she\r\nrattled out the tea-cups--always a cheerful sound.\r\n\r\nJust as they were sitting down, there was a knock heard at the door,\r\nand without waiting for it to be opened from the inside, some one\r\nlifted the latch, and in a man\'s voice asked, if one George Wilson\r\nlived there?\r\n\r\nMrs. Wilson was entering on a long and sorrowful explanation of his\r\nhaving once lived there, but of his having dropped down dead; when\r\nAlice, with the instinct of love (for in all usual and common\r\ninstances sight and hearing failed to convey impressions to her\r\nuntil long after other people had received them), arose, and\r\ntottered to the door.\r\n\r\n"My bairn!--my own dear bairn!" she exclaimed, falling on Will\r\nWilson\'s neck.\r\n\r\nYou may fancy the hospitable and welcoming commotion that ensued;\r\nhow Mrs. Wilson laughed, and talked, and cried, all together, if\r\nsuch a thing can be done; and how Mary gazed with wondering pleasure\r\nat her old playmate; now a dashing, bronzed-looking, ringleted\r\nsailor, frank, and hearty, and affectionate.\r\n\r\nBut it was something different from common to see Alice\'s joy at\r\nonce more having her foster-child with her.  She did not speak, for\r\nshe really could not; but the tears came coursing down her old\r\nwithered cheeks, and dimmed the horn spectacles she had put on, in\r\norder to pry lovingly into his face.  So what with her failing\r\nsight, and her tear-blinded eyes, she gave up the attempt of\r\nlearning his face by heart through the medium of that sense, and\r\ntried another.  She passed her sodden, shrivelled hands, all\r\ntrembling with eagerness, over his manly face, bent meekly down in\r\norder that she might more easily make her strange inspection.  At\r\nlast, her soul was satisfied.\r\n\r\nAfter tea, Mary feeling sure there was much to be said on both\r\nsides, at which it would be better none should be present, not even\r\nan intimate friend like herself, got up to go away.  This seemed to\r\narouse Alice from her dreamy consciousness of exceeding happiness,\r\nand she hastily followed Mary to the door.  There, standing outside,\r\nwith the latch in her hand, she took hold of Mary\'s arm, and spoke\r\nnearly the first words she had uttered since her nephew\'s return.\r\n\r\n"My dear! I shall never forgive mysel, if my wicked words to-night\r\nare any stumbling-block in your path.  See how the Lord has put\r\ncoals of fire on my head!  O Mary, don\'t let my being an unbelieving\r\nThomas weaken your faith.  Wait patiently on the Lord, whatever your\r\ntrouble may be."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII.   A TRAVELLER\'S TALES.\r\n\r\n     "The mermaid sat upon the rocks\r\n            All day long,\r\n      Admiring her beauty and combing her locks,\r\n            And singing a mermaid song.\r\n\r\n     "And hear the mermaid\'s song you may,\r\n            As sure as sure can be,\r\n      If you will but follow the sun all day,\r\n            And souse with him into the sea."\r\n                                --W. S. LANDOR.\r\n\r\nIt was perhaps four or five days after the events mentioned in the\r\nlast chapter, that one evening, as Mary stood lost in reverie at the\r\nwindow, she saw Will Wilson enter the court, and come quickly up to\r\nher door.  She was glad to see him, for he had always been a friend\r\nof hers, perhaps too much like her in character ever to become\r\nanything nearer or dearer.  She opened the door in readiness to\r\nreceive his frank greeting, which she as frankly returned.\r\n\r\n"Come, Mary! on with bonnet and shawl, or whatever rigging you women\r\nrequire before leaving the house.  I\'m sent to fetch you, and I\r\ncan\'t lose time when I\'m under orders."\r\n\r\n"Where am I to go to?" asked Mary, as her heart leaped up at the\r\nthought of who might be waiting for her.\r\n\r\n"Not very far," replied he.  "Only to old Job Legh\'s round the\r\ncorner there.  Aunt would have me come and see these new friends of\r\nhers, and then we meant to ha\' come on here to see you and your\r\nfather, but the old gentleman seems inclined to make a night of it,\r\nand have you all there.  Where is your father?  I want to see him.\r\nHe must come too."\r\n\r\n"He\'s out, but I\'ll leave word next door for him to follow me;\r\nthat\'s to say, if he comes home afore long."  She added\r\nhesitatingly, "Is any one else at Job\'s?"\r\n\r\n"No!  My aunt Jane would not come, for some maggot or other; and as\r\nfor Jem!  I don\'t know what you\'ve all been doing to him, but he\'s\r\nas down-hearted a chap as I\'d wish to see.  He\'s had his sorrows\r\nsure enough, poor lad!  But it\'s time for him to be shaking off his\r\ndull looks, and not go moping like a girl."\r\n\r\n"Then he\'s come fra\' Halifax, is he?" asked Mary.\r\n\r\n"Yes! his body\'s come, but I think he\'s left his heart behind him.\r\nHis tongue I\'m sure he has, as we used to say to childer, when they\r\nwould not speak.  I try to rouse him up a bit, and I think he likes\r\nhaving me with him, but still he\'s as gloomy and as dull as can be.\r\n\'T was only yesterday he took me to the works, and you\'d ha\' thought\r\nus two Quakers as the spirit hadn\'t moved, all the way down we were\r\nso mum.  It\'s a place to craze a man, certainly; such a noisy black\r\nhole!  There were one or two things worth looking at, the bellows\r\nfor instance, or the gale they called a bellows.  I could ha\' stood\r\nnear it a whole day; and if I\'d a berth in that place, I should like\r\nto be bellows-man, if there is such a one.  But Jem weren\'t diverted\r\neven with that; he stood as grave as a judge while it blew my hat\r\nout o\' my hand.  He\'s lost all relish for his food, too, which frets\r\nmy aunt sadly.  Come! Mary, aren\'t you ready?"\r\n\r\nShe had not been able to gather if she were to see Jem at Job\r\nLegh\'s; but when the door was opened, she at once saw and felt he\r\nwas not there.  The evening then would be a blank; at least so she\r\nthought for the first five minutes; but she soon forgot her\r\ndisappointment in the cheerful meeting of old friends, all, except\r\nherself, with some cause for rejoicing at that very time.  Margaret,\r\nwho could not be idle, was knitting away, with her face looking full\r\ninto the room, away from her work.  Alice sat meek and patient with\r\nher dimmed eyes and gentle look, trying to see and to hear, but\r\nnever complaining; indeed, in her inner self she was blessing God\r\nfor her happiness; for the joy of having her nephew, her child, near\r\nher, was far more present to her mind, than her deprivations of\r\nsight and hearing.\r\n\r\nJob was in the full glory of host and hostess too, for by a tacit\r\nagreement he had roused himself from his habitual abstraction, and\r\nhad assumed many of Margaret\'s little household duties.  While he\r\nmoved about he was deep in conversation with the young sailor,\r\ntrying to extract from him any circumstances connected with the\r\nnatural history of the different countries he had visited.\r\n\r\n"Oh! if you are fond of grubs, and flies, and beetles, there\'s no\r\nplace for \'em like Sierra Leone.  I wish you\'d had some of ours; we\r\nhad rather too much of a good thing; we drank them with our drink,\r\nand could scarcely keep from eating them with our food.  I never\r\nthought any folk could care for such fat green beasts as those, or I\r\nwould ha\' brought you them by the thousand.  A plate full o\' peas\r\nsoup would ha\' been full enough for you, I dare say; it were often\r\ntoo full for us."\r\n\r\n"I would ha\' given a good deal for some on \'em," said Job.\r\n\r\n"Well, I knew folk at home liked some o\' the queer things one meets\r\nwith abroad; but I never thought they\'d care for them nasty slimy\r\nthings.  I were always on the look-out for a mermaid, for that, I\r\nknew, were a curiosity."\r\n\r\n"You might ha\' looked long enough," said Job, in an undertone of\r\ncontempt, which, however, the quick ears of the sailor caught.\r\n\r\n"Not so long, master, in some latitudes, as you think.  It stands to\r\nreason th\' sea hereabouts is too cold for mermaids; for women here\r\ndon\'t go half naked on account o\' climate.  But I\'ve been in lands\r\nwhere muslin were too hot to wear on land, and where the sea were\r\nmore than milk-warm; and though I\'d never the good luck to see a\r\nmermaid in that latitude, I know them that has."\r\n\r\n"Do tell us about it," cried Mary.\r\n\r\n"Pooh, pooh!" said Job, the naturalist.\r\n\r\nBoth speeches determined Will to go on with his story.  What could a\r\nfellow who had never been many miles from home know about the\r\nwonders of the deep, that he should put him down in that way?\r\n\r\n"Well, it were Jack Harris, our third mate last voyage, as many and\r\nmany a time telled us all about it.  You see he were becalmed off\r\nChatham Island (that\'s in the Great Pacific, and a warm enough\r\nlatitude for mermaids, and sharks, and such like perils).  So some\r\nof the men took the long-boat, and pulled for the island to see what\r\nit were like; and when they got near, they heard a puffing, like a\r\ncreature come up to take breath; you\'ve never heard a diver?  No!\r\nWell; you\'ve heard folks in th\' asthma, and it were for all the\r\nworld like that.  So they looked around, and what should they see\r\nbut a mermaid, sitting on a rock, and sunning herself.  The water is\r\nalways warmer when it\'s rough, you know, so I suppose in the calm\r\nshe felt it rather chilly, and had come up to warm herself."\r\n\r\n"What was she like?" asked Mary breathlessly.\r\n\r\nJob took his pipe off the chimney-piece, and began to smoke with\r\nvery audible puffs, as if the story were not worth listening to.\r\n\r\n"Oh! Jack used to say she was for all the world as beautiful as any\r\nof the wax ladies in the barbers\' shops; only, Mary, there were one\r\nlittle difference; her hair was bright grass-green."\r\n\r\n"I should not think that was pretty," said Mary hesitatingly; as if\r\nnot liking to doubt the perfection of anything belonging to such an\r\nacknowledged beauty.\r\n\r\n"Oh! but it is when you\'re used to it.  I always think when first we\r\nget sight of land, there\'s no colour so lovely as grass-green.\r\nHowever, she had green hair sure enough: and were proud enough of\r\nit, too; for she were combing it out full length when first they saw\r\nher.  They all thought she were a fair prize, and maybe as good as a\r\nwhale in ready money (they were whale-fishers, you know).  For some\r\nfolk think a deal of mermaids, whatever other folk do."  This was a\r\nhit at Job, who retaliated in a series of sonorous spittings and\r\npuffs.\r\n\r\n"So, as I were saying, they pulled towards her, thinking to catch\r\nher.  She were all the while combing her beautiful hair, and\r\nbeckoning to them, while with the other hand she held a\r\nlooking-glass."\r\n\r\n"How many hands had she?" asked Job.\r\n\r\n"Two, to be sure, just like any other woman," answered Will\r\nindignantly.\r\n\r\n"Oh! I thought you said she beckoned with one hand, and combed her\r\nhair with another, and held a looking-glass with her third," said\r\nJob, with provoking quietness.\r\n\r\n"No!  I didn\'t! at least, if I did, I meant she did one thing after\r\nanother, as anyone but" (here he mumbled a word or two) "could\r\nunderstand.  Well, Mary," turning very decidedly towards her, "when\r\nshe saw them coming near, whether it were she grew frightened at\r\ntheir fowling-pieces, as they had on board for a bit o\' shooting on\r\nthe island, or whether it were she were just a fickle jade as did\r\nnot rightly know her own mind (which, seeing one half of her was\r\nwoman, I think myself was most probably), but when they were only\r\nabout two oars\' length from the rock where she sat, down she plopped\r\ninto the water, leaving nothing but her hinder end of a fish tail\r\nsticking up for a minute, and then that disappeared too."\r\n\r\n"And did they never see her again?" asked Mary.\r\n\r\n"Never so plain; the man who had the second watch one night declared\r\nhe saw her swimming round the ship, and holding up her glass for him\r\nto look in; and then he saw the little cottage near Aber in Wales\r\n(where his wife lived) as plain as ever he saw it in life, and his\r\nwife standing outside, shading her eyes as if she were looking for\r\nhim.  But Jack Harris gave him no credit, for he said he were always\r\na bit of a romancer, and beside that, were a home-sick, down-hearted\r\nchap."\r\n\r\n"I wish they had caught her," said Mary, musing.\r\n\r\n"They got one thing as belonged to her," replied Will, "and that\r\nI\'ve often seen with my own eyes, and I reckon it\'s a sure proof of\r\nthe truth of their story, for them that wants proof."\r\n\r\n"What was it?" asked Margaret, almost anxious her grandfather should\r\nbe convinced.\r\n\r\n"Why, in her hurry she left her comb on the rock, and one o\' the men\r\nspied it; so they thought that were better than nothing, and they\r\nrowed there and took it, and Jack Harris had it on board the John\r\nCropper, and I saw him comb his hair with it every Sunday morning."\r\n\r\n"What was it like?" asked Mary eagerly; her imagination running on\r\ncoral combs, studded with pearls.\r\n\r\n"Why, if it had not had such a strange yarn belonging to it, you\'d\r\nnever ha\' noticed it from any other small-tooth comb."\r\n\r\n"I should rather think not," sneered Job Legh.\r\n\r\nThe sailor bit his lips to keep down his anger against an old man.\r\nMargaret felt very uneasy, knowing her grandfather so well, and not\r\ndaring to guess what caustic remark might come next to irritate the\r\nyoung sailor guest.\r\n\r\nMary, however, was too much interested by the wonders of the deep to\r\nperceive the incredulity with which Job Legh received Wilson\'s\r\naccount of the mermaid, and when he left off, half offended, and\r\nvery much inclined not to open his lips again through the evening,\r\nshe eagerly said--\r\n\r\n"Oh, do tell us something more of what you hear and see on board\r\nship.  Do, Will!"\r\n\r\n"What\'s the use, Mary, if folk won\'t believe one.  There are things\r\nI saw with my own eyes, that some people would pish and pshaw at, as\r\nif I were a baby to be put down by cross noises.  But I\'ll tell you,\r\nMary," with an emphasis on YOU, "some more of the wonders of the\r\nsea, sin\' you\'re not too wise to believe me.  I have seen a fish\r\nfly."\r\n\r\nThis did stagger Mary.  She had heard of mermaids as signs of inns\r\nand as sea-wonders, but never of flying fish.  Not so Job.  He put\r\ndown his pipe, and nodding his head as a token of approbation, he\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n"Ay! ay! young man.  Now you\'re speaking truth."\r\n\r\n"Well, now, you\'ll swallow that, old gentleman.  You\'ll credit me\r\nwhen I say I\'ve seen a critter half fish, half bird, and you won\'t\r\ncredit me when I say there be such beasts as mermaids, half fish,\r\nhalf woman.  To me, one\'s just as strange as t\'other."\r\n\r\n"You never saw the mermaid yoursel," interposed Margaret gently.\r\nBut "love me, love my dog," was Will Wilson\'s motto, only his\r\nversion was, "Believe me, believe Jack Harris"; and the remark was\r\nnot so soothing to him as it was intended to have been.\r\n\r\n"It\'s the Exocetus; one of the Malacopterygii Abdominales," said\r\nJob, much interested.\r\n\r\n"Ay, there you go! you\'re one o\' them folks as never knows beasts\r\nunless they\'re called out o\' their names.  Put \'em in Sunday\r\nclothes, and you know \'em, but in their work-a-day English you never\r\nknow nought about \'em.  I\'ve met wi\' many o\' your kidney; and if I\'d\r\nha\' known it, I\'d ha\' christened poor Jack\'s mermaid wi\' some grand\r\ngibberish of a name.  Mermaidicus Jack Harrisensis; that\'s just like\r\ntheir new-fangled words.  D\'ye believe there\'s such a thing as the\r\nMermaidicus, master?" asked Will, enjoying his own joke uncommonly,\r\nas most people do.\r\n\r\n"Not I! tell me about the"--\r\n\r\n"Well!" said Will, pleased at having excited the old gentleman\'s\r\nfaith and credit at last, "it were on this last voyage, about a\r\nday\'s sail from Madeira, that one of our men"--\r\n\r\n"Not Jack Harris, I hope," murmured Job.\r\n\r\n"Called me," continued Will, not noticing the interruption, "to see\r\nthe what d\'ye call it--flying fish I say it is.  It were twenty feet\r\nout o\' water, and it flew near on to a hundred yards.  But I say,\r\nold gentleman, I ha\' gotten one dried, and if you\'ll take it, why,\r\nI\'ll give it you; only," he added, in a lower tone, "I wish you\'d\r\njust gie me credit for the Mermaidicus."\r\n\r\nI really believe, if the assuming faith in the story of the mermaid\r\nhad been made the condition of receiving the flying fish, Job Legh,\r\nsincere man as he was, would have pretended belief; he was so much\r\ndelighted at the idea of possessing this specimen.  He won the\r\nsailor\'s heart by getting up to shake both his hands in his vehement\r\ngratitude, puzzling poor old Alice, who yet smiled through her\r\nwonder; for she understood the action to indicate some kindly\r\nfeeling towards her nephew.\r\n\r\nJob wanted to prove his gratitude, and was puzzled how to do it.  He\r\nfeared the young man would not appreciate any of his duplicate\r\nAraneides; not even the great American Mygale, one of his most\r\nprecious treasures; or else he would gladly have bestowed any\r\nduplicate on the donor of a real dried Exocetus.  What could he do\r\nfor him?  He could ask Margaret to sing.  Other folks beside her old\r\ndoting grandfather thought a deal of her songs.  So Margaret began\r\nsome of her noble old-fashioned songs.  She knew no modern music\r\n(for which her auditors might have been thankful), but she poured\r\nher rich voice out in some of the old canzonets she had lately\r\nlearnt while accompanying the musical lecturer on his tour.\r\n\r\nMary was amused to see how the young sailor sat entranced; mouth,\r\neyes, all open, in order to catch every breath of sound.  His very\r\nlids refused to wink, as if afraid in that brief proverbial interval\r\nto lose a particle of the rich music that floated through the room.\r\nFor the first time the idea crossed Mary\'s mind that it was possible\r\nthe plain little sensible Margaret, so prim and demure, might have\r\npower over the heart of the handsome, dashing spirited Will Wilson.\r\n\r\nJob, too, was rapidly changing his opinion of his new guest.  The\r\nflying fish went a great way, and his undisguised admiration for\r\nMargaret\'s singing carried him still further.\r\n\r\nIt was amusing enough to see these two, within the hour so barely\r\ncivil to each other, endeavouring now to be ultra-agreeable.  Will,\r\nas soon as he had taken breath (a long, deep gasp of admiration)\r\nafter Margaret\'s song, sidled up to Job, and asked him in a sort of\r\ndoubting tone--\r\n\r\n"You wouldn\'t like a live Manx cat, would ye, master?"\r\n\r\n"A what?" exclaimed Job.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know its best name," said Will humbly.  "But we call \'em\r\njust Manx cats.  They\'re cats without tails."\r\n\r\nNow Job, in all his natural history, had never heard of such\r\nanimals; so Will continued--\r\n\r\n"Because I\'m going, afore joining my ship, to see mother\'s friends\r\nin the island, and would gladly bring you one, if so be you\'d like\r\nto have it.  They look as queer and out o\' nature as flying fish,\r\nor"--he gulped the words down that should have followed.\r\n"Especially when you see \'em walking a roof-top, right again the\r\nsky, when a cat, as is a proper cat, is sure to stick her tail stiff\r\nout behind, like a slack-rope dancer a-balancing; but these cats\r\nhaving no tail, cannot stick it out, which captivates some people\r\nuncommonly.  If yo\'ll allow me, I\'ll bring one for Miss there,"\r\njerking his head at Margaret.  Job assented with grateful curiosity,\r\nwishing much to see the tailless phenomenon.\r\n\r\n"When are you going to sail?" asked Mary.\r\n\r\n"I cannot justly say; our ship\'s bound for America next voyage, they\r\ntell me.  A messmate will let me know when her sailing-day is fixed;\r\nbut I\'ve got to go to th\' Isle o\' Man first.  I promised uncle last\r\ntime I were in England to go this next time.  I may have to hoist\r\nthe blue Peter any day; so, make much of me while you have me,\r\nMary."\r\n\r\nJob asked him if he had been in America.\r\n\r\n"Haven\'t I!  North and South both!  This time we\'re bound to North.\r\nYankee-Land as we call it, where Uncle Sam lives."\r\n\r\n"Uncle who?" said Mary.\r\n\r\n"Oh, it\'s a way sailors have of speaking.  I only mean I\'m going to\r\nBoston, U.S., that\'s Uncle Sam."\r\n\r\nMary did not understand, so she left him and went to sit by Alice,\r\nwho could not hear conversation unless expressly addressed to her.\r\nShe had sat patiently silent the greater part of the night, and now\r\ngreeted Mary with a quiet smile.\r\n\r\n"Where\'s yo\'r father?" asked she.\r\n\r\n"I guess he\'s at his Union! he\'s there most evenings."\r\n\r\nAlice shook her head; but whether it were that she did not hear, or\r\nthat she did not quite approve of what she heard, Mary could not\r\nmake out.  She sat silently watching Alice, and regretting over her\r\ndimmed and veiled eyes, formerly so bright and speaking.  As if\r\nAlice understood by some other sense what was passing in Mary\'s\r\nmind, she turned suddenly round, and answered Mary\'s thought.\r\n\r\n"Yo\'re mourning for me, my dear? and there\'s no need, Mary.  I\'m as\r\nhappy as a child.  I sometimes think I am a child, whom the Lord is\r\nhushabying to my long sleep.  For when I were a nurse-girl, my\r\nmissis always telled me to speak very soft and low, and to darken\r\nthe room that her little one might go to sleep; and now all noises\r\nare hushed and still to me, and the bonny earth seems dim and dark,\r\nand I know it\'s my Father lulling me away to my long sleep.  I\'m\r\nvery well content; and yo mustn\'t fret for me.  I\'ve had well-nigh\r\nevery blessing in life I could desire."\r\n\r\nMary thought of Alice\'s long-cherished, fond wish to revisit the\r\nhome of her childhood, so often and often deferred, and now probably\r\nnever to take place.  Or if it did, how changed from the fond\r\nanticipation of what it was to have been!  It would be a mockery to\r\nthe blind and deaf Alice.\r\n\r\nThe evening came quickly to an end.  There was the humble cheerful\r\nmeal, and then the bustling, merry farewell, and Mary was once more\r\nin the quietness and solitude of her own dingy, dreary-looking home;\r\nher father still out, the fire extinguished, and her evening\'s task\r\nof work lying all undone upon the dresser.  But it had been a\r\npleasant little interlude to think upon.  It had distracted her\r\nattention for a few hours from the pressure of many uneasy thoughts,\r\nof the dark, heavy, oppressive times, when sorrow and want seemed to\r\nsurround her on every side; of her father, his changed and altered\r\nlooks, telling so plainly of broken health, and an embittered heart;\r\nof the morrow, and the morrow beyond that, to be spent in that close\r\nmonotonous workroom, with Sally Leadbitter\'s odious whispers hissing\r\nin her ear; and of the hunted look, so full of dread, from Miss\r\nSimmonds\' door-step up and down the street, lest her persecuting\r\nlover should be near; for he lay in wait for her with wonderful\r\nperseverance, and of late had made himself almost hateful, by the\r\nunmanly force which he had used to detain her to listen to him, and\r\nthe indifference with which he exposed her to the remarks of the\r\npassers-by, any one of whom might circulate reports which it would\r\nbe terrible for her father to hear--and worse than death should they\r\nreach Jem Wilson.  And all this she had drawn upon herself by her\r\ngiddy flirting.  Oh! how she loathed the recollection of the hot\r\nsummer evening, when, worn out by stitching and sewing, she had\r\nloitered homewards with weary languor, and first listened to the\r\nvoice of the tempter.\r\n\r\nAnd Jem Wilson!  O Jem, Jem, why did you not come to receive some of\r\nthe modest looks and words of love which Mary longed to give you, to\r\ntry and make up for the hasty rejection which you as hastily took to\r\nbe final, though both mourned over it with many tears.  But day\r\nafter day passed away, and patience seemed of no avail; and Mary\'s\r\ncry was ever the old moan of the Moated Grange--\r\n\r\n     "\'Why comes he not?\' she said,\r\n      \'I am aweary, aweary.\r\n       I would that I were dead.\'"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV.   JEM\'S INTERVIEW WITH POOR ESTHER.\r\n\r\n"Know the temptation ere you judge the crime!\r\n Look on this tree--\'t was green, and fair and graceful;\r\n Yet now, save these few shoots, how dry and rotten!\r\n Thou canst not tell the cause.  Not long ago,\r\n A neighbour oak, with which its roots were twined,\r\n In falling wrenched them with such cruel force,\r\n That though we covered them again with care,\r\n Its beauty withered, and it pined away.\r\n So, could we look into the human breast,\r\n How oft the fatal blight that meets our view,\r\n Should we trace down to the torn, bleeding fibres\r\n Of a too trusting heart--where it were shame,\r\n For pitying tears, to give contempt or blame."\r\n                                    --"STREET WALKS."\r\n\r\nThe month was over;--the honeymoon to the newly-married; the\r\nexquisite convalescence to the "living mother of a living child";\r\n"the first dark days of nothingness" to the widow and the child\r\nbereaved; the term of penance, of hard labour, and of solitary\r\nconfinement, to the shrinking, shivering, hopeless prisoner.\r\n\r\n"Sick, and in prison, and ye visited me."  Shall you, or I, receive\r\nsuch blessing?  I know one who will.  An overseer of a foundry, an\r\naged man, with hoary hair, has spent his Sabbaths, for many years,\r\nin visiting the prisoners and the afflicted in Manchester New\r\nBailey; not merely advising and comforting, but putting means into\r\ntheir power of regaining the virtue and the peace they had lost;\r\nbecoming himself their guarantee in obtaining employment, and never\r\ndeserting those who have once asked help from him.*\r\n\r\n     *Vide Manchester Guardian of Wednesday, March 18,1846; and\r\n      also the Reports of Captain Williams, prison inspector.\r\n\r\nEsther\'s term of imprisonment was ended.  She received a good\r\ncharacter in the governor\'s books; she had picked her daily quantity\r\nof oakum, had never deserved the extra punishment of the treadmill,\r\nand had been civil and decorous in her language.  And once more she\r\nwas out of prison.  The door closed behind her with a ponderous\r\nclang, and in her desolation she felt as if shut out of home--from\r\nthe only shelter she could meet with, houseless and penniless as she\r\nwas, on that dreary day.\r\n\r\nBut it was but for an instant that she stood there doubting.  One\r\nthought had haunted her both by night and by day, with monomaniacal\r\nincessancy; and that thought was how to save Mary (her dead sister\'s\r\nonly child, her own little pet in the days of her innocence) from\r\nfollowing in the same downward path to vice.  To whom could she\r\nspeak and ask for aid?  She shrank from the idea of addressing John\r\nBarton again; her heart sank within her, at the remembrance of his\r\nfierce repulsing action, and far fiercer words.  It seemed worse\r\nthan death to reveal her condition to Mary, else she sometimes\r\nthought that this course would be the most terrible, the most\r\nefficient warning.  She must speak; to that she was soul-compelled;\r\nbut to whom?  She dreaded addressing any of her former female\r\nacquaintance, even supposing they had sense, or spirit, or interest\r\nenough to undertake her mission.\r\n\r\nTo whom shall the outcast prostitute tell her tale?  Who will give\r\nher help in the day of need?  Hers is the leper sin, and all stand\r\naloof dreading to be counted unclean.\r\n\r\nIn her wild night wanderings, she had noted the haunts and habits of\r\nmany a one who little thought of a watcher in the poor forsaken\r\nwoman.  You may easily imagine that a double interest was attached\r\nby her to the ways and companionships of those with whom she had\r\nbeen acquainted in the days which, when present, she had considered\r\nhardly-worked and monotonous, but which now in retrospection seemed\r\nso happy and unclouded.  Accordingly, she had, as we have seen,\r\nknown where to meet with John Barton on that unfortunate night,\r\nwhich had only produced irritation in him, and a month\'s\r\nimprisonment to her.  She had also observed that he was still\r\nintimate with the Wilsons.  She had seen him walking and talking\r\nwith both father and son; her old friends too; and she had shed\r\nunregarded, unvalued tears, when some one had casually told her of\r\nGeorge Wilson\'s sudden death.  It now flashed across her mind that\r\nto the son, to Mary\'s playfellow, her elder brother in the days of\r\nchildhood, her tale might be told, and listened to with interest by\r\nhim, and some mode of action suggested by which Mary might be\r\nguarded and saved.\r\n\r\nAll these thoughts had passed through her mind while yet she was in\r\nprison; so when she was turned out, her purpose was clear, and she\r\ndid not feel her desolation of freedom as she would otherwise have\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nThat night she stationed herself early near the foundry where she\r\nknew Jem worked; he stayed later than usual, being detained by some\r\narrangements for the morrow.  She grew tired and impatient; many\r\nworkmen had come out of the door in the long, dead, brick wall, and\r\neagerly had she peered into their faces, deaf to all insult or\r\ncurse.  He must have gone home early; one more turn in the street,\r\nand she would go.\r\n\r\nDuring that turn he came out, and in the quiet of that street of\r\nworkshops and warehouses, she directly heard his steps.  How her\r\nheart failed her for an instant! but still she was not daunted from\r\nher purpose, painful as its fulfilment was sure to be.  She laid her\r\nhand on his arm.\r\n\r\nAs she expected, after a momentary glance at the person who thus\r\nendeavoured to detain him, he made an effort to shake it off, and\r\npass on.  But, trembling as she was, she had provided against this\r\nby a firm and unusual grasp.\r\n\r\n"You must listen to me, Jem Wilson," she said, with almost an accent\r\nof command.\r\n\r\n"Go away, missis; I\'ve nought to do with you, either in hearkening\r\nor talking."\r\n\r\nHe made another struggle.\r\n\r\n"You must listen," she said again, authoritatively, "for Mary\r\nBarton\'s sake."\r\n\r\nThe spell of her name was as potent as that of the mariner\'s\r\nglittering eye.  "He listened like a three-year child."\r\n\r\n"I know you care enough for her to wish to save her from harm."\r\n\r\nHe interrupted his earnest gaze into her face, with the exclamation--\r\n\r\n"And who can yo be to know Mary Barton, or to know that she\'s aught\r\nto me?"\r\n\r\nThere was a little strife in Esther\'s mind for an instant, between\r\nthe shame of acknowledging herself, and the additional weight to her\r\nrevelation which such acknowledgment would give.  Then she spoke--\r\n\r\n"Do you remember Esther, the sister of John Barton\'s wife? the aunt\r\nto Mary?  And the valentine I sent you last February ten years?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I mind her well!  But yo are not Esther, are you?"  He looked\r\nagain into her face, and seeing that indeed it was his boyhood\'s\r\nfriend, he took her hand, and shook it with a cordiality that forgot\r\nthe present in the past.\r\n\r\n"Why, Esther!  Where han ye been this many a year?  Where han ye\r\nbeen wandering that we none of us could find you out?"\r\n\r\nThe question was asked thoughtlessly, but answered with fierce\r\nearnestness.\r\n\r\n"Where have I been?  What have I been doing?  Why do you torment me\r\nwith questions like these?  Can you not guess?  But the story of my\r\nlife is wanted to give force to my speech, afterwards I will tell it\r\nyou.  Nay! don\'t change your fickle mind now, and say you don\'t want\r\nto hear it.  You must hear it, and I must tell it; and then see\r\nafter Mary, and take care she does not become like me.  As she is\r\nloving now, so did I love once: one above me far."  She remarked\r\nnot, in her own absorption, the change in Jem\'s breathing, the\r\nsudden clutch at the wall which told the fearfully vivid interest he\r\ntook in what she said.  "He was so handsome, so kind!  Well, the\r\nregiment was ordered to Chester (did I tell you he was an officer?),\r\nand he could not bear to part from me, nor I from him, so he took me\r\nwith him.  I never thought poor Mary would have taken it so to\r\nheart!  I always meant to send for her to pay me a visit when I was\r\nmarried; for, mark you! he promised me marriage.  They all do.  Then\r\ncame three years of happiness.  I suppose I ought not to have been\r\nhappy, but I was.  I had a little girl, too.  Oh! the sweetest\r\ndarling that ever was seen!  But I must not think of her," putting\r\nher hand wildly up to her forehead, "or I shall go mad; I shall."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t tell me any more about yoursel," said Jem soothingly.\r\n\r\n"What! you\'re tired already, are you? but I will tell you; as you\'ve\r\nasked for it, you shall hear it.  I won\'t recall the agony of the\r\npast for nothing.  I will have the relief of telling it.  Oh, how\r\nhappy I was!"--sinking her voice into a plaintive, childlike manner.\r\n"It went like a shot through me when one day he came to me and told\r\nme he was ordered to Ireland, and must leave me behind; at Bristol\r\nwe then were."\r\n\r\nJem muttered some words; she caught their meaning, and in a pleading\r\nvoice continued--\r\n\r\n"Oh, don\'t abuse him; don\'t speak a word against him!  You don\'t\r\nknow how I love him yet; yet, when I am sunk so low.  You don\'t\r\nguess how kind he was.  He gave me fifty pounds before we parted,\r\nand I knew he could ill spare it.  Don\'t, Jem, please," as his\r\nmuttered indignation rose again.  For her sake he ceased.  "I might\r\nhave done better with the money; I see now.  But I did not know the\r\nvalue of it then.  Formerly I had earned it easily enough at the\r\nfactory, and as I had no more sensible wants, I spent it on dress\r\nand on eating.  While I lived with him, I had it for asking; and\r\nfifty pounds would, I thought, go a long way.  So I went back to\r\nChester, where I\'d been so happy, and set up a small-ware shop, and\r\nhired a room near.  We should have done well, but alas! alas! my\r\nlittle girl fell ill, and I could not mind my shop and her too:\r\nand things grew worse and worse.  I sold my goods anyhow to get\r\nmoney to buy her food and medicine; I wrote over and over again to\r\nher father for help, but he must have changed his quarters, for I\r\nnever got an answer.  The landlord seized the few bobbins and tapes\r\nI had left, for shop-rent; and the person to whom the mean little\r\nroom, to which we had been forced to remove, belonged, threatened to\r\nturn us out unless his rent was paid; it had run on many weeks, and\r\nit was winter, cold bleak winter; and my child was so ill, so ill,\r\nand I was starving.  And I could not bear to see her suffer, and\r\nforgot how much better it would be for us to die together;--oh, her\r\nmoans, her moans, which money could give the means of relieving!  So\r\nI went out into the street one January night--Do you think God will\r\npunish me for that?" she asked with wild vehemence, almost amounting\r\nto insanity, and shaking Jem\'s arm in order to force an answer from\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nBut before he could shape his heart\'s sympathy into words, her voice\r\nhad lost its wildness, and she spoke with the quiet of despair.\r\n\r\n"But it\'s no matter!  I\'ve done that since, which separates us as\r\nfar asunder as heaven and hell can be."  Her voice rose again to the\r\nsharp pitch of agony.  "My darling! my darling! even after death I\r\nmay not see thee, my own sweet one! she was so good--like a little\r\nangel.  What is that text, I don\'t remember,--the text mother used\r\nto teach me when I sat on her knee long ago; it begins, \'Blessed are\r\nthe pure\'"--\r\n\r\n"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God."\r\n\r\n"Ay, that\'s it!  It would break mother\'s heart if she knew what I am\r\nnow--it did break Mary\'s heart, you see.  And now I recollect it was\r\nabout her child I wanted to see you, Jem.  You know Mary Barton,\r\ndon\'t you?" said she, trying to collect her thoughts.\r\n\r\nYes, Jem knew her.  How well, his beating heart could testify.\r\n\r\n"Well, there\'s something to do for her; I forget what; wait a\r\nminute!  She is so like my little girl," said she, raising her eyes\r\nglistening with unshed tears, in search of the sympathy of Jem\'s\r\ncountenance.\r\n\r\nHe deeply pitied her; but oh! how he longed to recall her mind to\r\nthe subject of Mary, and the lover above her in rank, and the\r\nservice to be done for her sake.  But he controlled himself to\r\nsilence.  After awhile, she spoke again, and in a calmer voice.\r\n\r\n"When I came to Manchester (for I could not stay in Chester after\r\nher death), I found you all out very soon.  And yet I never thought\r\nmy poor sister was dead.  I suppose I would not think so.  I used to\r\nwatch about the court where John lived, for many and many a night,\r\nand gather all I could about them from the neighbours\' talk; for I\r\nnever asked a question.  I put this and that together, and followed\r\none, and listened to another; many\'s the time I\'ve watched the\r\npoliceman off his beat, and peeped through the chink of the\r\nwindow-shutter to see the old room, and sometimes Mary or her father\r\nsitting up late for some reason or another.  I found out Mary went\r\nto learn dressmaking, and I began to be frightened for her; for it\'s\r\na bad life for a girl to be out late at night in the streets, and\r\nafter many an hour of weary work, they\'re ready to follow after any\r\nnovelty that makes a little change.  But I made up my mind, that bad\r\nas I was, I could watch over Mary, and perhaps keep her from harm.  So\r\nI used to wait for her at nights, and follow her home, often when she\r\nlittle knew any one was near her.  There was one of her companions I\r\nnever could abide, and I\'m sure that girl is at the bottom of some\r\nmischief.  By-and-by Mary\'s walks homewards were not alone.  She was\r\njoined soon after she came out by a man; a gentleman.  I began to\r\nfear for her, for I saw she was light-hearted, and pleased with his\r\nattentions; and I thought worse of him for having such long talks\r\nwith that bold girl I told you of.  But I was laid up for a long\r\ntime with spitting of blood; and could do nothing.  I\'m sure it made\r\nmade me worse, thinking about what might be happening to Mary.  And\r\nwhen I came out, all was going on as before, only she seemed fonder\r\nof him than ever; and oh! Jem, her father won\'t listen to me, and\r\nit\'s you must save Mary!  You\'re like a brother to her, and maybe\r\ncould give her advice and watch over her, and at any rate John will\r\nhearken to you; only he\'s so stern, and so cruel."  She began to cry\r\na little at the remembrance of his harsh words; but Jem cut her short\r\nby his hoarse, stern inquiry--\r\n\r\n"Who is this spark that Mary loves?  Tell me his name!"\r\n\r\n"It\'s young Carson, old Carson\'s son, that your father worked for."\r\n\r\nThere was a pause.  She broke the silence--\r\n\r\n"O Jem, I charge you with the care of her!  I suppose it would be\r\nmurder to kill her, but it would be better for her to die than to\r\nlive to lead such a life as I do.  Do you hear me, Jem?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I hear you.  It would be better.  Better we were all dead."\r\nThis was said as if thinking aloud; but he immediately changed his\r\ntone and continued--\r\n\r\n"Esther, you may trust to my doing all I can for Mary.  That I have\r\ndetermined on.  And now listen to me.  You loathe the life you lead,\r\nelse you would not speak of it as you do.  Come home with me.  Come\r\nto my mother.  She and my aunt Alice live together.  I will see that\r\nthey give you a welcome.  And to-morrow I will see if some honest\r\nway of living cannot be found for you.  Come home with me."\r\n\r\nShe was silent for a minute, and he hoped he had gained his point.\r\nThen she said--\r\n\r\n"God bless you, Jem, for the words you have just spoken.  Some years\r\nago you might have saved me, as I hope and trust you will yet save\r\nMary.  But, it is too late now;--too late," she added, with accents\r\nof deep despair.\r\n\r\nStill he did not relax his hold.  "Come home," he said.\r\n\r\n"I tell you, I cannot.  I could not lead a virtuous life if I would.\r\nI should only disgrace you.  If you will know all," said she, as he\r\nstill seemed inclined to urge her, "I must have drink.  Such as live\r\nlike me could not bear life if they did not drink.  It\'s the only\r\nthing to keep us from suicide.  If we did not drink, we could not\r\nstand the memory of what we have been, and the thought of what we\r\nare, for a day.  If I go without food, and without shelter, I must\r\nhave my dram.  Oh! you don\'t know the awful nights I have had in\r\nprison for want of it," said she, shuddering, and glaring round with\r\nterrified eyes, as if dreading to see some spiritual creature, with\r\ndim form, near her.\r\n\r\n"It is so frightful to see them," whispering in tones of wildness,\r\nalthough so low spoken.  "There they go round and round my bed the\r\nwhole night through.  My mother, carrying little Annie (I wonder how\r\nthey got together) and Mary--and all looking at me with their sad,\r\nstony eyes; O Jem! it is so terrible!  They don\'t turn back either,\r\nbut pass behind the head of the bed, and I feel their eyes on me\r\neverywhere.  If I creep under the clothes I still see them; and what\r\nis worse," hissing out her words with fright, "they see me.  Don\'t\r\nspeak to me of leading a better life--I must have drink.  I cannot\r\npass to-night without a dram; I dare not."\r\n\r\nJem was silent from deep sympathy.  Oh! could he, then, do nothing\r\nfor her!  She spoke again, but in a less excited tone, although it\r\nwas thrillingly earnest.\r\n\r\n"You are grieved for me!  I know it better than if you told me in\r\nwords.  But you can do nothing for me.  I am past hope.  You can yet\r\nsave Mary.  You must.  She is innocent, except for the great error\r\nof loving one above her in station.  Jem! you WILL save her?"\r\n\r\nWith heart and soul, though in few words, Jem promised that if aught\r\nearthly could keep her from falling, he would do it.  Then she\r\nblessed him, and bade him good-night.\r\n\r\n"Stay a minute," said he, as she was on the point of departure.  "I\r\nmay want to speak to you again.  I mun know where to find you--where\r\ndo you live?"\r\n\r\nShe laughed strangely.  "And do you think one sunk so low as I am\r\nhas a home?  Decent, good people have homes.  We have none.  No; if\r\nyou want me, come at night and look at the corners of the streets\r\nabout here.  The colder, the bleaker, the more stormy the night, the\r\nmore certain you will be to find me.  For then," she added, with a\r\nplaintive fall in her voice, "it is so cold sleeping in entries, and\r\non door-steps, and I want a dram more than ever."\r\n\r\nAgain she rapidly turned off, and Jem also went on his way.  But\r\nbefore he reached the end of the street, even in the midst of the\r\njealous anguish that filled his heart, his conscience smote him.  He\r\nhad not done enough to save her.  One more effort, and she might\r\nhave come.  Nay, twenty efforts would have been well rewarded by her\r\nyielding.  He turned back, but she was gone.  In the tumult of his\r\nother feelings, his self-reproach was deadened for the time.  But\r\nmany and many a day afterwards he bitterly regretted his omission of\r\nduty; his weariness of well-doing.\r\n\r\nNow, the great thing was to reach home, and solitude.  Mary loved\r\nanother!  Oh! how should he bear it?  He had thought her rejection\r\nof him a hard trial, but that was nothing now.  He only remembered\r\nit, to be thankful that he had not yielded to the temptation of\r\ntrying his fate again, not in actual words, but in a meeting, where\r\nher manner should tell far more than words, that her sweet smiles,\r\nher dainty movements, her pretty household ways, were all to be\r\nreserved to gladden another\'s eyes and heart.  And he must live on;\r\nthat seemed the strangest.  That a long life (and he knew men did\r\nlive long, even with deep, biting sorrow corroding at their hearts)\r\nmust be spent without Mary; nay, with the consciousness she was\r\nanother\'s!  That hell of thought he would reserve for the quiet of\r\nhis own room, the dead stillness of night.  He was on the threshold\r\nof home now.\r\n\r\nHe entered.  There were the usual faces, the usual sights.  He\r\nloathed them, and then he cursed himself because he loathed them.\r\nHis mother\'s love had taken a cross turn, because he had kept the\r\ntempting supper she had prepared for him waiting until it was nearly\r\nspoilt.  Alice, her dulled senses deadening day by day, sat mutely\r\nnear the fire: her happiness bounded by the consciousness of the\r\npresence of her foster-child, knowing that his voice repeated what\r\nwas passing to her deafened ear, that his arm removed each little\r\nobstacle to her tottering steps.  And Will, out of the very kindness\r\nof his heart, talked more and more merrily than ever.  He saw Jem\r\nwas downcast, and fancied his rattling might cheer him; at any rate,\r\nit drowned his aunt\'s muttered grumblings, and in some measure\r\nconcealed the blank of the evening.  At last, bed-time came; and\r\nWill withdrew to his neighbouring lodging; and Jane and Alice Wilson\r\nhad raked the fire, and fastened doors and shutters, and pattered\r\nupstairs, with their tottering footsteps and shrill voices.  Jem,\r\ntoo, went to the closet termed his bedroom.  There was no bolt to\r\nthe door; but by one strong effort of his right arm a heavy chest\r\nwas moved against it, and he could sit down on the side of his bed,\r\nand think.\r\n\r\nMary loved another!  That idea would rise uppermost in his mind, and\r\nhad to be combated in all its forms of pain.  It was, perhaps, no\r\ngreat wonder that she should prefer one so much above Jem in the\r\nexternal things of life.  But the gentleman; why did he, with his\r\nrange of choice among the ladies of the land, why did he stoop down\r\nto carry off the poor man\'s darling?  With all the glories of the\r\ngarden at his hand, why did he prefer to cull the wild-rose,--Jem\'s\r\nown fragrant wild-rose?\r\n\r\nHis OWN!  Oh! never now his own!--Gone for evermore.\r\n\r\nThen uprose the guilty longing for blood!--the frenzy of\r\njealousy!--Some one should die.  He would rather Mary were dead,\r\ncold in her grave, than that she were another\'s.  A vision of her\r\npale, sweet face, with her bright hair all bedabbled with gore,\r\nseemed to float constantly before his aching eyes.  But hers were\r\never open, and contained, in their soft, deathly look, such mute\r\nreproach!  What had she done to deserve such cruel treatment from\r\nhim?  She had been wooed by one whom Jem knew to be handsome, gay,\r\nand bright, and she had given him her love.  That was all!  It was\r\nthe wooer who should die.  Yes, die, knowing the cause of his death.\r\nJem pictured him (and gloated on the picture), lying smitten, yet\r\nconscious; and listening to the upbraiding accusation of his\r\nmurderer.  How he had left his own rank, and dared to love a maiden\r\nof low degree! and oh! stinging agony of all--how she, in return,\r\nhad loved him!  Then the other nature spoke up, and bade him\r\nremember the anguish he should so prepare for Mary!  At first he\r\nrefused to listen to that better voice; or listened only to pervert.\r\nHe would glory in her wailing grief! he would take pleasure in her\r\ndesolation of heart!\r\n\r\nNo! he could not, said the still small voice.  It would be worse,\r\nfar worse, to have caused such woe, than it was now to bear his\r\npresent heavy burden.\r\n\r\nBut it was too heavy, too grievous to be borne, and live.  He would\r\nslay himself and the lovers should love on, and the sun shine\r\nbright, and he with his burning, woeful heart would be at rest.\r\n"Rest that is reserved for the people of God."\r\n\r\nHad he not promised, with such earnest purpose of soul as makes\r\nwords more solemn than oaths, to save Mary from becoming such as\r\nEsther?  Should he shrink from the duties of life, into the\r\ncowardliness of death?  Who would then guard Mary, with her love and\r\nher innocence?  Would it not be a goodly thing to serve her,\r\nalthough she loved him not; to be her preserving angel, through the\r\nperils of life; and she, unconscious all the while?\r\n\r\nHe braced up his soul, and said to himself, that with God\'s help he\r\nwould be that earthly keeper.\r\n\r\nAnd now the mists and the storms seemed clearing away from his path,\r\nthough it still was full of stinging thorns.  Having done the duty\r\nnearest to him (of reducing the tumult of his own heart to something\r\nlike order), the second became more plain before him.\r\n\r\nPoor Esther\'s experience had led her, perhaps too hastily, to the\r\nconclusion that Mr. Carson\'s intentions were evil towards Mary; at\r\nleast she had given no just ground for the fears she entertained\r\nthat such was the case.  It was possible, nay, to Jem\'s heart very\r\nprobable, that he might only be too happy to marry her.  She was a\r\nlady by right of nature, Jem thought; in movement, grace, and\r\nspirit.  What was birth to a Manchester manufacturer, many of whom\r\nglory, and justly too, in being the architects of their own\r\nfortunes?  And, as far as wealth was concerned, judging another by\r\nhimself, Jem could only imagine it a great privilege to lay it at\r\nthe feet of the loved one.  Harry Carson\'s mother had been a factory\r\ngirl; so, after all, what was the great reason for doubting his\r\nintentions towards Mary?\r\n\r\nThere might probably be some little awkwardness about the affair at\r\nfirst; Mary\'s father having such strong prejudices on the one hand;\r\nand something of the same kind being likely to exist on the part of\r\nMr. Carson\'s family.  But Jem knew he had power over John Barton\'s\r\nmind; and it would be something to exert that power in promoting\r\nMary\'s happiness, and to relinquish all thought of self in so doing.\r\n\r\nOh! why had Esther chosen him for this office?  It was beyond his\r\nstrength to act rightly!  Why had she singled him out?\r\n\r\nThe answer came when he was calm enough to listen for it: Because\r\nMary had no other friend capable of the duty required of him; the\r\nduty of a brother, as Esther imagined him to be in feeling, from his\r\nlong friendship.  He would be unto her as a brother.\r\n\r\nAs such, he ought to ascertain Harry Carson\'s intentions towards her\r\nin winning her affections.  He would ask him straightforwardly, as\r\nbecame man speaking to man, not concealing, if need were, the\r\ninterest he felt in Mary.\r\n\r\nThen, with the resolve to do his duty to the best of his power,\r\npeace came into his soul; he had left the windy storm and tempest\r\nbehind.\r\n\r\nTwo hours before day-dawn he fell asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV.   A VIOLENT MEETING BETWEEN THE RIVALS.\r\n\r\n     "What thoughtful heart can look into this gulf\r\n      That darkly yawns \'twixt rich and poor,\r\n      And not find food for saddest meditation!\r\n      Can see, without a pang of keenest grief,\r\n      Them fiercely battling (like some natural foes)\r\n      Whom God had made, with help and sympathy,\r\n      To stand as brothers, side by side, united!\r\n      Where is the wisdom that shall bridge this gulf,\r\n      And bind them once again in trust and love?"\r\n                                     --"LOVE-TRUTHS."\r\n\r\nWe must return to John Barton.  Poor John!  He never got over his\r\ndisappointing journey to London.  The deep mortification he then\r\nexperienced (with, perhaps, as little selfishness for its cause as\r\nmortification ever had) was of no temporary nature; indeed, few of\r\nhis feelings were.\r\n\r\nThen came a long period of bodily privation; of daily hunger after\r\nfood; and though he tried to persuade himself he could bear want\r\nhimself with stoical indifference, and did care about it as little\r\nas most men, yet the body took its revenge for its uneasy feelings.\r\nThe mind became soured and morose, and lost much of its equipoise.\r\nIt was no longer elastic, as in the days of youth, or in times of\r\ncomparative happiness; it ceased to hope.  And it is hard to live on\r\nwhen one can no longer hope.\r\n\r\nThe same state of feeling which John Barton entertained, if\r\nbelonging to one who had had leisure to think of such things, and\r\nphysicians to give names to them, would have been called monomania;\r\nso haunting, so incessant, were the thoughts that pressed upon him.\r\nI have somewhere read a forcibly described punishment among the\r\nItalians, worthy of a Borgia.  The supposed or real criminal was\r\nshut up in a room, supplied with every convenience and luxury; and\r\nat first mourned little over his imprisonment.  But day by day he\r\nbecame aware that the space between the walls of his apartment was\r\nnarrowing, and then he understood the end.  Those painted walls\r\nwould come into hideous nearness, and at last crush the life out of\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nAnd so day by day, nearer and nearer, came the diseased thoughts of\r\nJohn Barton.  They excluded the light of heaven, the cheering sounds\r\nof earth.  They were preparing his death.\r\n\r\nIt is true much of their morbid power might be ascribed to the use\r\nof opium.  But before you blame too harshly this use, or rather\r\nabuse, try a hopeless life, with daily cravings of the body for\r\nfood.  Try, not alone being without hope yourself, but seeing all\r\naround you reduced to the same despair, arising from the same\r\ncircumstances; all around you telling (though they use no words or\r\nlanguage), by their looks and feeble actions, that they are\r\nsuffering and sinking under the pressure of want.  Would you not be\r\nglad to forget life, and its burdens?  And opium gives forgetfulness\r\nfor a time.\r\n\r\nIt is true they who thus purchase it pay dearly for their oblivion;\r\nbut can you expect the uneducated to count the cost of their\r\nwhistle?  Poor wretches!  They pay a heavy price.  Days of\r\noppressive weariness and languor, whose realities have the feeble\r\nsickliness of dreams; nights, whose dreams are fierce realities of\r\nagony; sinking health, tottering frames, incipient madness, and\r\nworse, the CONSCIOUSNESS of incipient madness; this is the price of\r\ntheir whistle.  But have you taught them the science of\r\nconsequences?\r\n\r\nJohn Barton\'s overpowering thought, which was to work out his fate\r\non earth, was rich and poor; why are they so separate, so distinct,\r\nwhen God has made them all?  It is not His will that their interests\r\nare so far apart.  Whose doing is it?\r\n\r\nAnd so on into the problems and mysteries of life, until, bewildered\r\nand lost, unhappy and suffering, the only feeling that remained\r\nclear and undisturbed in the tumult of his heart, was hatred to the\r\none class, and keen sympathy with the other.\r\n\r\nBut what availed his sympathy?  No education had given him wisdom;\r\nand without wisdom, even love, with all its effects, too often works\r\nbut harm.  He acted to the best of his judgment, but it was a\r\nwidely-erring judgment.\r\n\r\nThe actions of the uneducated seem to me typified in those of\r\nFrankenstein, that monster of many human qualities, ungifted with a\r\nsoul, a knowledge of the difference between good and evil.\r\n\r\nThe people rise up to life; they irritate us, they terrify us, and\r\nwe become their enemies.  Then, in the sorrowful moment of our\r\ntriumphant power, their eyes gaze on us with mute reproach.  Why\r\nhave we made them what they are; a powerful monster, yet without the\r\ninner means for peace and happiness?\r\n\r\nJohn Barton became a Chartist, a Communist, all that is commonly\r\ncalled wild and visionary.  Ay! but being visionary is something.\r\nIt shows a soul, a being not altogether sensual; a creature who\r\nlooks forward for others, if not for himself.\r\n\r\nAnd with all his weakness he had a sort of practical power, which\r\nmade him useful to the bodies of men to whom he belonged.  He had a\r\nready kind of rough Lancashire eloquence, arising out of the fulness\r\nof his heart, which was very stirring to men similarly\r\ncircumstanced, who liked to hear their feelings put into words.  He\r\nhad a pretty clear head at times, for method and arrangement; a\r\nnecessary talent to large combinations of men.  And what perhaps\r\nmore than all made him relied upon and valued, was the consciousness\r\nwhich every one who came in contact with him felt, that he was\r\nactuated by no selfish motives; that his class, his order, was what\r\nhe stood by, not the rights of his own paltry self.  For even in\r\ngreat and noble men, as soon as self comes into prominent existence,\r\nit becomes a mean and paltry thing.\r\n\r\nA little time before this, there had come one of those occasions for\r\ndeliberation among the employed, which deeply interested John\r\nBarton, and the discussions concerning which had caused his frequent\r\nabsence from home of late.\r\n\r\nI am not sure if I can express myself in the technical terms of\r\neither masters or workmen, but I will try simply to state the case\r\non which the latter deliberated.\r\n\r\nAn order for coarse goods came in from a new foreign market.  It was\r\na large order, giving employment to all the mills engaged in that\r\nspecies of manufacture; but it was necessary to execute it speedily,\r\nand at as low prices as possible, as the masters had reason to\r\nbelieve that a duplicate order had been sent to one of the\r\ncontinental manufacturing towns, where there were no restrictions on\r\nfood, no taxes on building or machinery, and where consequently they\r\ndreaded that the goods could be made at a much lower price than they\r\ncould afford them for; and that, by so acting and charging, the\r\nrival manufacturers would obtain undivided possession of the market.\r\nIt was clearly their interest to buy cotton as cheaply, and to beat\r\ndown wages as low as possible.  And in the long run the interests of\r\nthe workmen would have been thereby benefited.  Distrust each other\r\nas they may, the employers and the employed must rise or fall\r\ntogether.  There may be some difference as to chronology, none as to\r\nfact.\r\n\r\nBut the masters did not choose to make all these circumstances\r\nknown.  They stood upon being the masters, and that they had a right\r\nto order work at their own prices, and they believed that in the\r\npresent depression of trade, and unemployment of hands, there would\r\nbe no great difficulty in getting it done.\r\n\r\nNow let us turn to the workmen\'s view of the question.  The masters\r\n(of the tottering foundation of whose prosperity they were ignorant)\r\nseemed doing well, and, like gentlemen, "lived at home in ease,"\r\nwhile they were starving, gasping on from day to day; and there was\r\na foreign order to be executed, the extent of which, large as it\r\nwas, was greatly exaggerated; and it was to be done speedily.  Why\r\nwere the masters offering such low wages under these circumstances?\r\nShame upon them!  It was taking advantage of their workpeople being\r\nalmost starved; but they would starve entirely rather than come into\r\nsuch terms.  It was bad enough to be poor, while by the labour of\r\ntheir thin hands, the sweat of their brows, the masters were made\r\nrich; but they would not be utterly ground down to dust.  No! they\r\nwould fold their hands and sit idle, and smile at the masters, whom\r\neven in death they could baffle.  With Spartan endurance they\r\ndetermined to let the employers know their power, by refusing to\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nSo class distrusted class, and their want of mutual confidence\r\nwrought sorrow to both.  The masters would not be bullied, and\r\ncompelled to reveal why they felt it wisest and best to offer only\r\nsuch low wages; they would not be made to tell that they were even\r\nsacrificing capital to obtain a decisive victory over the\r\ncontinental manufacturers.  And the workmen sat silent and stern\r\nwith folded hands, refusing to work for such pay.  There was a\r\nstrike in Manchester.\r\n\r\nOf course it was succeeded by the usual consequences.  Many other\r\nTrades\' Unions, connected with different branches of business,\r\nsupported with money, countenance, and encouragement of every kind,\r\nthe stand which the Manchester power-loom weavers were making\r\nagainst their masters.  Delegates from Glasgow, from Nottingham, and\r\nother towns, were sent to Manchester, to keep up the spirit of\r\nresistance; a committee was formed, and all the requisite officers\r\nelected; chairman, treasurer, honorary secretary;--among them was\r\nJohn Barton.\r\n\r\nThe masters, meanwhile, took their measures.  They placarded the\r\nwalls with advertisements for power-loom weavers.  The workmen\r\nreplied by a placard in still larger letters, stating their\r\ngrievances.  The masters met daily in town, to mourn over the time\r\n(so fast slipping away) for the fulfilment of the foreign orders;\r\nand to strengthen each other in their resolution not to yield.  If\r\nthey gave up now, they might give up always.  It would never do.\r\nAnd amongst the most energetic of the masters, the Carsons, father\r\nand son, took their places.  It is well known, that there is no\r\nreligionist so zealous as a convert; no masters so stern, and\r\nregardless of the interests of their workpeople, as those who have\r\nrisen from such a station themselves.  This would account for the\r\nelder Mr. Carson\'s determination not to be bullied into yielding;\r\nnot even to be bullied into giving reasons for acting as the masters\r\ndid.  It was the employers\' will, and that should be enough for the\r\nemployed.  Harry Carson did not trouble himself much about the\r\ngrounds for his conduct.  He liked the excitement of the affair.  He\r\nliked the attitude of resistance.  He was brave, and he liked the\r\nidea of personal danger, with which some of the more cautious tried\r\nto intimidate the violent among the masters.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the power-loom weavers living in the more remote parts of\r\nLancashire, and the neighbouring counties, heard of the masters\'\r\nadvertisements for workmen; and in their solitary dwellings grew\r\nweary of starvation, and resolved to come to Manchester.  Foot-sore,\r\nway-worn, half-starved looking men they were, as they tried to steal\r\ninto town in the early dawn, before people were astir, or in the\r\ndusk of the evening.  And now began the real wrong-doing of the\r\nTrades\' Unions.  As to their decision to work, or not, at such a\r\nparticular rate of wages, that was either wise or unwise; all error\r\nof judgment at the worst.  But they had no right to tyrannise over\r\nothers, and tie them down to their own Procrustean bed.  Abhorring\r\nwhat they considered oppression in the masters, why did they oppress\r\nothers?  Because, when men get excited, they know not what they do.\r\nJudge, then, with something of the mercy of the Holy One, whom we\r\nall love.\r\n\r\nIn spite of policemen set to watch over the safety of the poor\r\ncountry weavers--in spite of magistrates, and prisons, and severe\r\npunishments--the poor depressed men tramping in from Burnley,\r\nPadiham, and other places, to work at the condemned "Starvation\r\nPrices," were waylaid, and beaten, and left by the roadside almost\r\nfor dead.  The police broke up every lounging knot of men:--they\r\nseparated quietly, to reunite half-a-mile out of town.\r\n\r\nOf course the feeling between the masters and workmen did not\r\nimprove under these circumstances.\r\n\r\nCombination is an awful power.  It is like the equally mighty agency\r\nof steam; capable of almost unlimited good or evil.  But to obtain a\r\nblessing on its labours, it must work under the direction of a high\r\nand intelligent will; incapable of being misled by passion or\r\nexcitement.  The will of the operatives had not been guided to the\r\ncalmness of wisdom.\r\n\r\nSo much for generalities.  Let us now return to individuals.\r\n\r\nA note, respectfully worded, although its tone of determination was\r\nstrong, had been sent by the power-loom weavers, requesting that a\r\n"deputation" of them might have a meeting with the masters, to state\r\nthe conditions they must have fulfilled before they would end the\r\nturn-out.  They thought they had attained a sufficiently commanding\r\nposition to dictate.  John Barton was appointed one of the\r\ndeputation.\r\n\r\nThe masters agreed to this meeting, being anxious to end the strife,\r\nalthough undetermined among themselves how far they should yield, or\r\nwhether they should yield at all.  Some of the old, whose experience\r\nhad taught them sympathy, were for concession.  Others, white-headed\r\nmen too, had only learnt hardness and obstinacy from the days of the\r\nyears of their lives, and sneered at the more gentle and yielding.\r\nThe younger men were one and all for an unflinching resistance to\r\nclaims urged with so much violence.  Of this party Harry Carson was\r\nthe leader.\r\n\r\nBut like all energetic people, the more he had to do the more time\r\nhe seemed to find.  With all his letter-writing, his calling, his\r\nbeing present at the New Bailey, when investigations of any case of\r\nviolence against knob-sticks* were going on, he beset Mary more than\r\never.  She was weary of her life for him.  From blandishments he had\r\neven gone to threats--threats that whether she would or not she\r\nshould be his; he showed an indifference that was most insulting to\r\neverything which might attract attention and injure her character.\r\n\r\n     *Knob-sticks; those who consent to work at lower wages.\r\n\r\nAnd still she never saw Jem.  She knew he had returned home.  She\r\nheard of him occasionally through his cousin, who roved gaily from\r\nhouse to house, finding and making friends everywhere.  But she\r\nnever saw him.  What was she to think?  Had he given her up?  Were a\r\nfew hasty words, spoken in a moment of irritation, to stamp her lot\r\nthrough life?  At times she thought that she could bear this meekly,\r\nhappy in her own constant power of loving.  For of change or of\r\nforgetfulness she did not dream.  Then at other times her state of\r\nimpatience was such, that it required all her self-restraint to\r\nprevent her from going and seeking him out, and (as man would do to\r\nman, or woman to woman) begging him to forgive her hasty words, and\r\nallow her to retract them, and bidding him accept of the love that\r\nwas filling her whole heart.  She wished Margaret had not advised\r\nher against such a manner of proceeding; she believed it was her\r\nfriend\'s words that seemed to make such a simple action impossible,\r\nin spite of all the internal urgings.  But a friend\'s advice is only\r\nthus powerful, when it puts into language the secret oracle of our\r\nsouls.  It was the whisperings of her womanly nature that caused her\r\nto shrink from any unmaidenly action, not Margaret\'s counsel.\r\n\r\nAll this time, this ten days or so, of Will\'s visit to Manchester,\r\nthere was something going on which interested Mary even now, and\r\nwhich, in former times, would have exceedingly amused and excited\r\nher.  She saw as clearly as if told in words, that the merry,\r\nrandom, boisterous sailor had fallen deeply in love with the quiet,\r\nprim, somewhat plain Margaret: she doubted if Margaret was aware\r\nof it, and yet, as she watched more closely, she began to think some\r\ninstinct made the blind girl feel whose eyes were so often fixed\r\nupon her pale face; that some inner feeling made the delicate and\r\nbecoming rose-flush steal over her countenance.  She did not speak\r\nso decidedly as before; there was a hesitation in her manner, that\r\nseemed to make her very attractive; as if something softer, more\r\nlovable than excellent sense, were coming in as a motive for speech;\r\nher eyes had always been soft, and were in no ways disfigured by her\r\nblindness, and now seemed to have a new charm, as they quivered\r\nunder their white, downcast lids.  She must be conscious, thought\r\nMary--heart answering to heart.\r\n\r\nWill\'s love had no blushings, no downcast eyes, no weighing of\r\nwords; it was as open and undisguised as his nature; yet he seemed\r\nafraid of the answer its acknowledgment might meet with.  It was\r\nMargaret\'s angelic voice that had entranced him, and which made him\r\nthink of her as a being of some other sphere, that he feared to woo.\r\nSo he tried to propitiate Job in all manner of ways.  He went over\r\nto Liverpool to rummage in his great sea-chest for the flying-fish\r\n(no very odorous present, by the way).  He hesitated over a child\'s\r\ncaul for some time, which was, in his eyes, a far greater treasure\r\nthan any Exocetus.  What use could it be of to a landsman?  Then\r\nMargaret\'s voice rang in his ears; and he determined to sacrifice\r\nit, his most precious possession, to one whom she loved as she did\r\nher grandfather.\r\n\r\nIt was rather a relief to him, when, having put it and the flying-\r\nfish together in a brown paper parcel, and sat upon them for\r\nsecurity all the way in the railroad, he found that Job was so\r\nindifferent to the precious caul that he might easily claim it\r\nagain.  He hung about Margaret, till he had received many warnings\r\nand reproaches from his conscience in behalf of his dear aunt\r\nAlice\'s claims upon his time.  He went away, and then he bethought\r\nhim of some other little word with Job.  And he turned back, and\r\nstood talking once more in Margaret\'s presence, door in hand, only\r\nwaiting for some little speech of encouragement to come in and sit\r\ndown again.  But as the invitation was not given, he was forced to\r\nleave at last, and go and do his duty.\r\n\r\nFour days had Jem Wilson watched for Mr. Harry Carson without\r\nsuccess; his hours of going and returning to his home were so\r\nirregular, owing to the meetings and consultations among the\r\nmasters, which were rendered necessary by the turn-out.  On the\r\nfifth, without any purpose on Jem\'s part, they met.\r\n\r\nIt was the workmen\'s dinner-hour, the interval between twelve and\r\none; when the streets of Manchester are comparatively quiet, for a\r\nfew shopping ladies and lounging gentlemen count for nothing in that\r\nbusy, bustling, living place.  Jem had been on an errand for his\r\nmaster, instead of returning to his dinner; and in passing along a\r\nlane, a road (called, in compliment to the intentions of some future\r\nbuilder, a street), he encountered Harry Carson, the only person, as\r\nfar as he saw, beside himself, treading the unfrequented path.\r\nAlong one side ran a high broad fence, blackened over by coal-tar,\r\nand spiked and stuck with pointed nails at the top, to prevent any\r\none from climbing over into the garden beyond.  By this fence was\r\nthe footpath.  The carriage-road was such as no carriage, no, not\r\neven a cart, could possibly have passed along without Hercules to\r\nassist in lifting it out of the deep clay ruts.  On the other side\r\nof the way was a dead brick wall; and a field after that, where\r\nthere was a saw-pit and joiner\'s shed.\r\n\r\nJem\'s heart beat violently when he saw the gay, handsome young man\r\napproaching, with a light buoyant step.  This, then, was he whom\r\nMary loved.  It was, perhaps, no wonder; for he seemed to the poor\r\nsmith so elegant, so well appointed, that he felt the superiority in\r\nexternals, strangely and painfully, for an instant.  Then something\r\nuprose within him, and told him, that "a man\'s a man for a\' that,\r\nfor \'a that, and twice as much as a\' that."  And he no longer felt\r\ntroubled by the outward appearance of his rival.\r\n\r\nHarry Carson came on, lightly bounding over the dirty places with\r\nalmost a lad\'s buoyancy.  To his surprise the dark, sturdy-looking\r\nartisan stopped him by saying respectfully--\r\n\r\n"May I speak a word wi\' you, sir?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly, my good man," looking his astonishment; then finding\r\nthat the promised speech did not come very quickly, he added, "But\r\nmake haste, for I\'m in a hurry."\r\n\r\nJem had cast about for some less abrupt way of broaching the subject\r\nuppermost in his mind than he now found himself obliged to use.\r\nWith a husky voice that trembled as he spoke, he said--\r\n\r\n"I think, sir, yo\'re keeping company wi\' a young woman called Mary\r\nBarton?"\r\n\r\nA light broke in upon Henry Carson\'s mind, and he paused before he\r\ngave the answer for which the other waited.\r\n\r\nCould this man be a lover of Mary\'s?  And (strange stinging thought)\r\ncould he be beloved by her, and so have caused her obstinate\r\nrejection of himself?  He looked at Jem from head to foot, a black,\r\ngrimy mechanic, in dirty fustian clothes, strongly built, and\r\nawkward (according to the dancing-master); then he glanced at\r\nhimself, and recalled the reflection he had so lately quitted in his\r\nbedroom.  It was impossible.  No woman with eyes could choose the\r\none when the other wooed.  It was Hyperion to a Satyr.  That\r\nquotation came aptly; he forgot "That a man\'s a man for a\' that."\r\nAnd yet here was a clue, which he had often wanted, to her changed\r\nconduct towards him.  If she loved this man--if--he hated the\r\nfellow, and longed to strike him.  He would know all.\r\n\r\n"Mary Barton! let me see.  Ay, that is the name of the girl.  An\r\narrant flirt the little hussy is; but very pretty.  Ay, Mary Barton\r\nis her name."\r\n\r\nJem bit his lips.  Was it then so; that Mary was a flirt; the giddy\r\ncreature of whom he spoke?  He would not believe it, and yet how he\r\nwished the suggestive words unspoken.  That thought must keep now,\r\nthough.  Even if she were, the more reason for there being some one\r\nto protect her; poor faulty darling,\r\n\r\n"She\'s a good girl, sir, though maybe a bit set up with her beauty;\r\nbut she\'s her father\'s only child, sir, and"--he stopped; he did not\r\nlike to express suspicion, and yet he was determined he would be\r\ncertain there was ground for none.  What should he say?\r\n\r\n"Well, my fine fellow, and what have I to do with that?  It\'s but\r\nloss of my time, and yours, too, if you\'ve only stopped me to tell\r\nme Mary Barton is very pretty; I know that well enough."\r\n\r\nHe seemed as though he would have gone on, but Jem put his black,\r\nworking, right hand upon his arm to detain him.  The haughty young\r\nman shook it off, and with his glove pretended to brush away the\r\nsooty contamination that might be left upon his light greatcoat\r\nsleeve.  The little action aroused Jem.\r\n\r\n"I will tell you in plain words, what I have got to say to you,\r\nyoung man.  It\'s been telled me by one as knows, and has seen, that\r\nyou walk with this same Mary Barton, and are known to be courting\r\nher; and her as spoke to me about it, thinks as how Mary loves you.\r\nThat may be or may not.  But I\'m an old friend of hers and her\r\nfather\'s; and I just wished to know if you mean to marry the girl.\r\nSpite of what you said of her lightness, I ha\' known her long enough\r\nto be sure she\'ll make a noble wife for any one, let him be what he\r\nmay; and I mean to stand by her like a brother; and if you mean\r\nrightly, you\'ll not think the worse on me for what I\'ve now said;\r\nand if--but no, I\'ll not say what I\'ll do to the man who wrongs a\r\nhair of her head.  He shall rue it to the longest day he lives,\r\nthat\'s all.  Now, sir, what I ask of you is this.  If you mean fair\r\nand honourable by her, well and good: but if not, for your own\r\nsake as well as hers, leave her alone, and never speak to her more."\r\nJem\'s voice quivered with the earnestness with which he spoke, and\r\nhe eagerly waited for some answer.\r\n\r\nHarry Carson, meanwhile, instead of attending very particularly to\r\nthe purpose the man had in addressing him, was trying to gather from\r\nhis speech what was the real state of the case.  He succeeded so far\r\nas to comprehend that Jem inclined to believe that Mary loved his\r\nrival; and consequently, that if the speaker were attached to her\r\nhimself, he was not a favoured admirer.  The idea came into Mr.\r\nCarson\'s mind, that perhaps, after all, Mary loved him in spite of\r\nher frequent and obstinate rejections; and that she had employed\r\nthis person (whoever he was) to bully him into marrying her.  He\r\nresolved to try and ascertain more correctly the man\'s relation to\r\nher.  Either he was a lover, and if so, not a favoured one (in which\r\ncase Mr. Carson could not at all understand the man\'s motives for\r\ninteresting himself in securing her marriage); or he was a friend,\r\nan accomplice, whom she had employed to bully him.  So little faith\r\nin goodness have the mean and selfish!\r\n\r\n"Before I make you into my confidant, my good man," said Mr. Carson,\r\nin a contemptuous tone, "I think it might be as well to inquire your\r\nright to meddle with our affairs.  Neither Mary, nor I, as I\r\nconceive, called you in as a mediator."  He paused: he wanted a\r\ndistinct answer to this last supposition.  None came; so he began to\r\nimagine he was to be threatened into some engagement, and his angry\r\nspirit rose.\r\n\r\n"And so, my fine fellow, you will have the kindness to leave us to\r\nourselves, and not to meddle with what does not concern you.  If you\r\nwere a brother or father of hers, the case might have been\r\ndifferent.  As it is, I can only consider you an impertinent\r\nmeddler."\r\n\r\nAgain he would have passed on, but Jem stood in a determined way\r\nbefore him, saying--\r\n\r\n"You say if I had been her brother, or her father, you\'d have\r\nanswered me what I ask.  Now, neither father nor brother could love\r\nher as I have loved her--ay, and as I love her still; if love gives\r\na right to satisfaction, it\'s next to impossible any one breathing\r\ncan come up to my right.  Now, sir, tell me! do you mean fair by\r\nMary or not?  I\'ve proved my claim to know, and, by G--, I will\r\nknow."\r\n\r\n"Come, come, no impudence," replied Mr. Carson, who, having\r\ndiscovered what he wanted to know (namely, that Jem was a lover of\r\nMary\'s, and that she was not encouraging his suit), wished to pass\r\non.  "Father, brother, or rejected lover" (with an emphasis on the\r\nword rejected) "no one has a right to interfere between my little\r\ngirl and me.  No one shall.  Confound you, man! get out of my way,\r\nor I\'ll make you," as Jem still obstructed his path with dogged\r\ndetermination.\r\n\r\n"I won\'t, then, till you\'ve given me your word about Mary," replied\r\nthe mechanic, grinding his words out between his teeth, and the\r\nlivid paleness of the anger he could no longer keep down covering\r\nhis face till he looked ghastly.\r\n\r\n"Won\'t you?" (with a taunting laugh), "then I\'ll make you."  The\r\nyoung man raised his slight cane, and smote the artisan across the\r\nface with a stinging stroke.  An instant afterwards he lay stretched\r\nin the muddy road, Jem standing over him, panting with rage.  What\r\nhe would have done next in his moment of ungovernable passion, no\r\none knows; but a policeman from the main street, into which this\r\nroad led, had been sauntering about for some time, unobserved by\r\neither of the parties, and expecting some kind of conclusion like\r\nthe present to the violent discussion going on between the two young\r\nmen.  In a minute he had pinioned Jem, who sullenly yielded to the\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\nMr. Carson was on his feet directly, his face glowing with rage or\r\nshame.\r\n\r\n"Shall I take him to the lock-ups for assault, sir?" said the\r\npoliceman.\r\n\r\n"No, no," exclaimed Mr. Carson.  "I struck him first.  It was no\r\nassault on his side: though," he continued, hissing out his words\r\nto Jem, who even hated freedom procured for him, however justly, at\r\nthe intervention of his rival, "I will never forgive or forget\r\ninsult.  Trust me," he gasped the words in excess of passion, "Mary\r\nshall fare no better for your insolent interference."  He laughed,\r\nas if with the consciousness of power.\r\n\r\nJem replied with equal excitement--\r\n\r\n"And if you dare to injure her in the least, I will await you where\r\nno policeman can step in between.  And God shall judge between us\r\ntwo."\r\n\r\nThe policeman now interfered with persuasions and warnings.  He\r\nlocked his arm in Jem\'s to lead him away in an opposite direction to\r\nthat in which he saw Mr. Carson was going.  Jem submitted gloomily,\r\nfor a few steps, then wrenched himself free.  The policeman shouted\r\nafter him--\r\n\r\n"Take care, my man! there\'s no girl on earth worth what you\'ll be\r\nbringing on yourself if you don\'t mind."\r\n\r\nBut Jem was out of hearing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI.   MEETING BETWEEN MASTERS AND WORKMEN.\r\n\r\n     "Not for a moment take the scorner\'s chair;\r\n      While seated there, thou know\'st not how a word,\r\n      A tone, a look, may gall thy brother\'s heart,\r\n      And make him turn in bitterness against thee."\r\n                                            --"LOVE-TRUTHS."\r\n\r\nThe day arrived on which the masters were to have an interview with\r\na deputation of the workpeople.  The meeting was to take place in a\r\npublic room, at an hotel; and there, about eleven o\'clock, the\r\nmill-owners, who had received the foreign orders, began to collect.\r\n\r\nOf course, the first subject, however full their minds might be of\r\nanother, was the weather.  Having done their duty by all the showers\r\nand sunshine which had occurred during the past week, they fell to\r\ntalking about the business which brought them together.  There might\r\nbe about twenty gentlemen in the room, including some by courtesy,\r\nwho were not immediately concerned in the settlement of the present\r\nquestion; but who, nevertheless, were sufficiently interested to\r\nattend.  These were divided into little groups, who did not seem by\r\nany means unanimous.  Some were for a slight concession, just a\r\nsugar-plum to quieten the naughty child, a sacrifice to peace and\r\nquietness.  Some were steadily and vehemently opposed to the\r\ndangerous precedent of yielding one jot or one tittle to the outward\r\nforce of a turn-out.  It was teaching the workpeople how to become\r\nmasters, said they.  Did they want the wildest thing here-after,\r\nthey would know that the way to obtain their wishes would be to\r\nstrike work.  Besides, one or two of those present had only just\r\nreturned from the New Bailey, where one of the turn-outs had been\r\ntried for a cruel assault on a poor north-country weaver, who had\r\nattempted to work at the low price.  They were indignant, and justly\r\nso, at the merciless manner in which the poor fellow had been\r\ntreated; and their indignation at wrong, took (as it often does) the\r\nextreme form of revenge.  They felt as if, rather than yield to the\r\nbody of men who were resorting to such cruel measures towards their\r\nfellow-workmen, they, the masters, would sooner relinquish all the\r\nbenefits to be derived from the fulfilment of the commission, in\r\norder that the workmen might suffer keenly.  They forgot that the\r\nstrike was in this instance the consequence of want and need,\r\nsuffered unjustly, as the endurers believed; for, however insane,\r\nand without ground of reason, such was their belief, and such was\r\nthe cause of their violence.  It is a great truth that you cannot\r\nextinguish violence by violence.  You may put it down for a time;\r\nbut while you are crowing over your imaginary success, see if it\r\ndoes not return with seven devils worse than its former self!\r\n\r\nNo one thought of treating the workmen as brethren and friends, and\r\nopenly, clearly, as appealing to reasonable men, stating exactly and\r\nfully the circumstances which led the masters to think it was the\r\nwise policy of the time to make sacrifices themselves, and to hope\r\nfor them from the operatives.\r\n\r\nIn going from group to group in the room, you caught such a medley\r\nof sentences as the following--\r\n\r\n"Poor devils! they\'re near enough to starving, I\'m afraid.  Mrs.\r\nAldred makes two cows\' heads into soup every week, and people come\r\nmany miles to fetch it; and if these times last, we must try and do\r\nmore.  But we must not be bullied into anything!"\r\n\r\n"A rise of a shilling or so won\'t make much difference, and they\r\nwill go away thinking they\'ve gained their point."\r\n\r\n"That\'s the very thing I object to.  They\'ll think so, and whenever\r\nthey\'ve a point to gain, no matter how unreasonable, they\'ll strike\r\nwork."\r\n\r\n"It really injures them more than us."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see how our interests can be separated."\r\n\r\n"The d--d brute had thrown vitriol on the poor fellow\'s ankles, and\r\nyou know what a bad part that is to heal.  He had to stand still\r\nwith the pain, and that left him at the mercy of the cruel wretch,\r\nwho beat him about the head till you\'d hardly have known he was a\r\nman.  They doubt if he\'ll live."\r\n\r\n"If it were only for that, I\'ll stand out against them, even if it\r\nis the cause of my ruin."\r\n\r\n"Ay, I for one won\'t yield one farthing to the cruel brutes; they\'re\r\nmore like wild beasts than human beings."\r\n\r\n(Well, who might have made them different?)\r\n\r\n"I say, Carson, just go and tell Duncombe of this fresh instance of\r\ntheir abominable conduct.  He\'s wavering, but I think this will\r\ndecide him."\r\n\r\nThe door was now opened, and the waiter announced that the men were\r\nbelow, and asked if it were the pleasure of the gentlemen that they\r\nshould be shown up.\r\n\r\nThey assented, and rapidly took their places round the official\r\ntable; looking, as like as they could, to the Roman senators who\r\nawaited the irruption of Brennus and his Gauls.\r\n\r\nTramp, tramp, came the heavy clogged feet up the stairs; and in a\r\nminute five wild, earnest-looking men stood in the room.  John\r\nBarton, from some mistake as to time, was not among them.  Had they\r\nbeen larger-boned men, you would have called them gaunt; as it was,\r\nthey were little of stature, and their fustian clothes hung loosely\r\nupon their shrunk limbs.  In choosing their delegates, too, the\r\noperatives had had more regard to their brains, and power of speech,\r\nthan to their wardrobes; they might have read the opinions of that\r\nworthy Professor Teufelsdreck, in Sartor Resartus, to judge from the\r\ndilapidated coats and trousers, which yet clothed men of parts and\r\nof power.  It was long since many of them had known the luxury of a\r\nnew article of dress; and air-gaps were to be seen in their\r\ngarments.  Some of the masters were rather affronted at such a\r\nragged detachment coming between the wind and their nobility; but\r\nwhat cared they.\r\n\r\nAt the request of a gentleman hastily chosen to officiate as\r\nchairman, the leader of the delegates read, in a high-pitched,\r\npsalm-singing voice, a paper, containing the operatives\' statement\r\nof the case at issue, their complaints, and their demands, which\r\nlast were not remarkable for moderation.\r\n\r\nHe was then desired to withdraw for a few minutes, with his\r\nfellow-delegates, to another room, while the masters considered what\r\nshould be their definite answer.\r\n\r\nWhen the men had left the room, a whispered earnest consultation\r\ntook place, every one re-urging his former arguments.  The conceders\r\ncarried the day, but only by a majority of one.  The minority\r\nhaughtily and audibly expressed their dissent from the measures to\r\nbe adopted, even after the delegates re-entered the room; their\r\nwords and looks did not pass unheeded by the quick-eyed operatives;\r\ntheir names were registered in bitter hearts.\r\n\r\nThe masters could not consent to the advance demanded by the\r\nworkmen.  They would agree to give one shilling per week more than\r\nthey had previously offered.  Were the delegates empowered to accept\r\nsuch offer?\r\n\r\nThey were empowered to accept or decline any offer made that day by\r\nthe masters.\r\n\r\nThen it might be as well for them to consult among themselves as to\r\nwhat should be their decision.  They again withdrew.\r\n\r\nIt was not for long.  They came back, and positively declined any\r\ncompromise of their demands.\r\n\r\nThen up sprang Mr. Henry Carson, the head and voice of the violent\r\nparty among the masters, and addressing the chairman, even before\r\nthe scowling operatives, he proposed some resolutions, which he, and\r\nthose who agreed with him, had been concocting during this last\r\nabsence of the deputation.\r\n\r\nThey were, firstly, withdrawing the proposal just made, and\r\ndeclaring all communication between the masters and that particular\r\nTrades\' Union at an end; secondly, declaring that no master would\r\nemploy any workman in future, unless he signed a declaration that he\r\ndid not belong to any Trades\' Union, and pledged himself not to\r\nassist or subscribe to any society, having for its object\r\ninterference with the masters\' powers; and, thirdly, that the\r\nmasters should pledge themselves to protect and encourage all\r\nworkmen willing to accept employment on those conditions, and at the\r\nrate of wages first offered.  Considering that the men who now stood\r\nlistening with lowering brows of defiance were all of them leading\r\nmembers of the Union, such resolutions were in themselves\r\nsufficiently provocative of animosity: but not content with simply\r\nstating them, Harry Carson went on to characterise the conduct of\r\nthe workmen in no measured terms; every word he spoke rendering\r\ntheir looks more livid, their glaring eyes more fierce.  One among\r\nthem would have spoken, but checked himself, in obedience to the\r\nstern glance and pressure on his arm, received from the leader.  Mr.\r\nCarson sat down, and a friend instantly got up to second the motion.\r\nIt was carried, but far from unanimously.  The chairman announced it\r\nto the delegates (who had been once more turned out of the room for\r\na division).  They received it with deep brooding silence, but spake\r\nnever a word, and left the room without even a bow.\r\n\r\nNow there had been some by-play at this meeting, not recorded in the\r\nManchester newspapers, which gave an account of the more regular\r\npart of the transaction.\r\n\r\nWhile the men had stood grouped near the door, on their first\r\nentrance, Mr. Harry Carson had taken out his silver pencil, and had\r\ndrawn an admirable caricature of them--lank, ragged, dispirited, and\r\nfamine-stricken.  Underneath he wrote a hasty quotation from the fat\r\nknight\'s well-known speech in Henry IV.  He passed it to one of his\r\nneighbours, who acknowledged the likeness instantly, and by him it\r\nwas sent round to others, who all smiled and nodded their heads.\r\nWhen it came back to its owner he tore the back of the letter on\r\nwhich it was drawn in two, twisted them up, and flung them into the\r\nfireplace; but, careless whether they reached their aim or not, he\r\ndid not look to see that they fell just short of any consuming\r\ncinders.\r\n\r\nThis proceeding was closely observed by one of the men.\r\n\r\nHe watched the masters as they left the hotel (laughing, some of\r\nthem were, at passing jokes), and when all had gone, he re-entered.\r\nHe went to the waiter, who recognised him.\r\n\r\n"There\'s a bit on a picture up yonder, as one o\' the gentlemen threw\r\naway; I\'ve a little lad at home as dearly loves a picture; by your\r\nleave I\'ll go up for it."\r\n\r\nThe waiter, good-natured and sympathetic, accompanied him upstairs;\r\nsaw the paper picked up and untwisted, and then being convinced, by\r\na hasty glance at its contents, that it was only what the man had\r\ncalled it, "a bit of a picture," he allowed him to bear away his\r\nprize.\r\n\r\nTowards seven o\'clock that evening, many operatives began to\r\nassemble in a room in the Weavers\' Arms public-house, a room\r\nappropriated for "festive occasions," as the landlord, in his\r\ncircular, on opening the premises, had described it.  But, alas! it\r\nwas on no festive occasion that they met there this night.  Starved,\r\nirritated, despairing men, they were assembling to hear the answer\r\nthat morning given by the masters to their delegates; after which,\r\nas was stated in the notice, a gentleman from London would have the\r\nhonour of addressing the meeting on the present state of affairs\r\nbetween the employers and the employed, or (as he chose to term\r\nthem) the idle and the industrious classes.  The room was not large,\r\nbut its bareness of furniture made it appear so.  Unshaded gas\r\nflared down upon the lean and unwashed artisans as they entered,\r\ntheir eyes blinking at the excess of light.\r\n\r\nThey took their seats on benches, and awaited the deputation.  The\r\nlatter, gloomily and ferociously, delivered the masters\' ultimatum,\r\nadding thereto not one word of their own; and it sank all the deeper\r\ninto the sore hearts of the listeners for their forbearance.\r\n\r\nThen the "gentleman from London" (who had been previously informed\r\nof the masters\' decision) entered.  You would have been puzzled to\r\ndefine his exact position, or what was the state of his mind as\r\nregarded education.  He looked so self-conscious, so far from\r\nearnest, among the group of eager, fierce, absorbed men, among whom\r\nhe now stood.  He might have been a disgraced medical student of the\r\nBob Sawyer class, or an unsuccessful actor, or a flashy shopman.\r\nThe impression he would have given you would have been unfavourable,\r\nand yet there was much about him that could only be characterised as\r\ndoubtful.\r\n\r\nHe smirked in acknowledgment of their uncouth greetings, and sat\r\ndown; then glancing round, he inquired whether it would not be\r\nagreeable to the gentlemen present to have pipes and liquor handed\r\nround, adding, that he would stand treat.\r\n\r\nAs the man who has had his taste educated to love reading, falls\r\ndevouringly upon books after a long abstinence, so these poor\r\nfellows, whose tastes had been left to educate themselves into a\r\nliking for tobacco, beer, and similar gratifications, gleamed up at\r\nthe proposal of the London delegate.  Tobacco and drink deaden the\r\npangs of hunger, and make one forget the miserable home, the\r\ndesolate future.\r\n\r\nThey were now ready to listen to him with approbation.  He felt it;\r\nand rising like a great orator, with his right arm outstretched, his\r\nleft in the breast of his waistcoat, he began to declaim, with a\r\nforced theatrical voice.\r\n\r\nAfter a burst of eloquence, in which he blended the deeds of the\r\nelder and the younger Brutus, and magnified the resistless might of\r\nthe "millions of Manchester," the Londoner descended to\r\nmatter-of-fact business, and in his capacity this way he did not\r\nbelie the good judgment of those who had sent him as a delegate.\r\nMasses of people, when left to their own free choice, seem to have\r\ndiscretion in distinguishing men of natural talent: it is a pity\r\nthey so little regard temper and principles.  He rapidly dictated\r\nresolutions, and suggested measures.  He wrote out a stirring\r\nplacard for the walls.  He proposed sending delegates to entreat the\r\nassistance of other Trades\' Unions in other towns.  He headed the\r\nlist of subscribing Unions, by a liberal donation from that with\r\nwhich he was especially connected in London; and what was more, and\r\nmore uncommon, he paid down the money in real, clinking, blinking,\r\ngolden sovereigns!  The money, alas! was cravingly required; but\r\nbefore alleviating any private necessities on the morrow, small sums\r\nwere handed to each of the delegates, who were in a day or two to\r\nset out on their expeditions to Glasgow, Newcastle, Nottingham, etc.\r\nThese men were most of them members of the deputation who had that\r\nmorning waited upon the masters.  After he had drawn up some\r\nletters, and spoken a few more stirring words, the gentleman from\r\nLondon withdrew, previously shaking hands all round; and many\r\nspeedily followed him out of the room, and out of the house.\r\n\r\nThe newly-appointed delegates, and one or two others, remained\r\nbehind to talk over their respective missions, and to give and\r\nexchange opinions in more homely and natural language than they\r\ndared to use before the London orator.\r\n\r\n"He\'s a rare chap, yon," began one, indicating the departed delegate\r\nby a jerk of his thumb towards the door.  "He\'s getten the gift of\r\nthe gab, anyhow!"\r\n\r\n"Ay! ay! he knows what he\'s about.  See how he poured it into us\r\nabout that there Brutus.  He were pretty hard, too, to kill his own\r\nson!"\r\n\r\n"I could kill mine if he took part with the masters; to be sure,\r\nhe\'s but a step-son, but that makes no odds," said another.\r\n\r\nBut now tongues were hushed, and all eyes were directed towards the\r\nmember of the deputation who had that morning returned to the hotel\r\nto obtain possession of Harry Carson\'s clever caricature of the\r\noperatives.\r\n\r\nThe heads clustered together, to gaze at and detect the likenesses.\r\n\r\n"That\'s John Slater!  I\'d ha\' known him anywhere, by his big nose.\r\nLord! how like; that\'s me, by G-d, it\'s the very way I\'m obligated\r\nto pin my waistcoat up, to hide that I\'ve getten no shirt.  That IS\r\na shame, and I\'ll not stand it."\r\n\r\n"Well!" said John Slater, after having acknowledged his nose and his\r\nlikeness; "I could laugh at a jest as well as e\'er the best on \'em,\r\nthough it did tell agen mysel, if I were not clemming" (his eyes\r\nfilled with tears; he was a poor, pinched, sharp-featured man, with\r\na gentle and melancholy expression of countenance), "and if I could\r\nkeep from thinking of them at home, as is clemming; but with their\r\ncries for food ringing in my ears, and making me afeard of going\r\nhome, and wonder if I should hear \'em wailing out, if I lay cold and\r\ndrowned at th\' bottom o\' th\' canal, there--why, man, I cannot laugh\r\nat aught.  It seems to make me sad that there is any as can make\r\ngame on what they\'ve never knowed; as can make such laughable\r\npictures on men, whose very hearts within \'em are so raw and sore as\r\nours were and are, God help us."\r\n\r\nJohn Barton began to speak; they turned to him with great attention.\r\n"It makes me more than sad, it makes my heart burn within me, to see\r\nthat folk can make a jest of striving men; of chaps who comed to ask\r\nfor a bit o\' fire for th\' old granny, as shivers i\' th\' cold; for a\r\nbit o\' bedding, and some warm clothing to the poor wife who lies in\r\nlabour on th\' damp flags; and for victuals for the childer, whose\r\nlittle voices are getting too faint and weak to cry aloud wi\'\r\nhunger.  For, brothers, is not them the things we ask for when we\r\nask for more wage?  We donnot want dainties, we want bellyfuls; we\r\ndonnot want gimcrack coats and waistcoats, we want warm clothes; and\r\nso that we get \'em, we\'d not quarrel wi\' what they\'re made on.  We\r\ndonnot want their grand houses, we want a roof to cover us from the\r\nrain, and the snow, and the storm; ay, and not alone to cover us,\r\nbut the helpless ones that cling to us in the keen wind, and ask us\r\nwith their eyes why we brought \'em into th\' world to suffer?"\r\n\r\nHe lowered his deep voice almost to a whisper--\r\n\r\n"I\'ve seen a father who had killed his child rather than let it clem\r\nbefore his eyes; and he were a tender-hearted man."\r\n\r\nHe began again in his usual tone.  "We come to th\' masters wi\' full\r\nhearts, to ask for them things I named afore.  We know that they\'ve\r\ngetten money, as we\'ve earned for \'em; we know trade is mending, and\r\nthey\'ve large orders, for which they\'ll be well paid; we ask for our\r\nshare o\' th\' payment; for, say we, if th\' masters get our share of\r\npayment it will only go to keep servants and horses--to more dress\r\nand pomp.  Well and good, if yo choose to be fools we\'ll not hinder\r\nyou, so long as you\'re just; but our share we must and will have;\r\nwe\'ll not be cheated.  We want it for daily bread, for life itself;\r\nand not for our own lives neither (for there\'s many a one here, I\r\nknow by mysel, as would be glad and thankful to lie down and die out\r\no\' this weary world), but for the lives of them little ones, who\r\ndon\'t yet know what life is, and are afeard of death.  Well, we come\r\nbefore th\' masters to state what we want, and what we must have,\r\nafore we\'ll set shoulder to their work; and they say, \'No.\'  One\r\nwould think that would be enough of hard-heartedness, but it isn\'t.\r\nThey go and make jesting pictures on us!  I could laugh at mysel, as\r\nwell as poor John Slater there; but then I must be easy in my mind\r\nto laugh.  Now I only know that I would give the last drop of my\r\nblood to avenge us on yon chap, who had so little feeling in him as\r\nto make game on earnest, suffering men!"\r\n\r\nA low angry murmur was heard among the men, but it did not yet take\r\nform or words.  John continued--\r\n\r\n"You\'ll wonder, chaps, how I came to miss the time this morning;\r\nI\'ll just tell you what I was a-doing.  Th\' chaplain at the New\r\nBailey sent and gived me an order to see Jonas Higginbotham; him as\r\nwas taken up last week for throwing vitriol in a knob-stick\'s face.\r\nWell, I couldn\'t help but go; and I didn\'t reckon it would ha\' kept\r\nme so late.  Jonas were like one crazy when I got to him; he said he\r\ncould na get rest night or day for th\' face of the poor fellow he\r\nhad damaged; then he thought on his weak, clemmed look, as he\r\ntramped, footsore, into town; and Jonas thought, maybe, he had left\r\nthem at home as would look for news, and hope and get none, but,\r\nhaply, tidings of his death.  Well, Jonas had thought on these\r\nthings till he could not rest, but walked up and down continually\r\nlike a wild beast in his cage.  At last he bethought him on a way to\r\nhelp a bit, and he got the chaplain to send for me; and he telled me\r\nthis; and that th\' man were lying in the Infirmary, and he bade me\r\ngo (to-day\'s the day as folk may be admitted into th\' Infirmary) and\r\nget his silver watch, as was his mother\'s, and sell it as well as I\r\ncould, and take the money, and bid the poor knob-stick send it to\r\nhis friends beyond Burnley; and I were to take him Jonas\'s kind\r\nregards, and he humbly axed him to forgive him.  So I did what Jonas\r\nwished.  But, bless your life, none on us would ever throw vitriol\r\nagain (at least at a knob-stick) if they could see the sight I saw\r\nto-day.  The man lay, his face all wrapped in cloths, so I didn\'t\r\nsee that: but not a limb, nor a bit of a limb, could keep from\r\nquivering with pain.  He would ha\' bitten his hand to keep down his\r\nmoans, but couldn\'t, his face hurt him so if he moved it e\'er so\r\nlittle.  He could scarce mind me when I telled him about Jonas; he\r\ndid squeeze my hand when I jingled the money, but when I axed his\r\nwife\'s name, he shrieked out, \'Mary, Mary, shall I never see you\r\nagain?  Mary, my darling, they\'ve made me blind because I wanted to\r\nwork for you and our own baby; O Mary, Mary!\'  Then the nurse came,\r\nand said he were raving, and that I had made him worse.  And I\'m\r\nafeard it was true; yet I were loth to go without knowing where to\r\nsend the money. . . . .  So that kept me beyond my time, chaps."\r\n\r\n"Did you hear where the wife lived at last?" asked many anxious\r\nvoices.\r\n\r\n"No! he went on talking to her, till his words cut my heart like a\r\nknife.  I axed th\' nurse to find out who she was, and where she\r\nlived.  But what I\'m more especial naming it now for is this,--for\r\none thing I wanted you all to know why I weren\'t at my post this\r\nmorning; for another, I wish to say, that I, for one, ha\' seen\r\nenough of what comes of attacking knob-sticks, and I\'ll ha\' nought\r\nto do with it no more."\r\n\r\nThere were some expressions of disapprobation, but John did not mind\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n"Nay! I\'m no coward," he replied, "and I\'m true to th\' backbone.\r\nWhat I would like, and what I would do, would be to fight the\r\nmasters.  There\'s one among yo called me a coward.  Well! every man\r\nhas a right to his opinion; but since I\'ve thought on th\' matter\r\nto-day I\'ve thought we han all on us been more like cowards in\r\nattacking the poor like ourselves; them as has none to help, but mun\r\nchoose between vitriol and starvation.  I say we\'re more cowardly in\r\ndoing that than in leaving them alone.  No! what I would do is this.\r\nHave at the masters!"  Again he shouted, "Have at the masters!"  He\r\nspoke lower; all listened with hushed breath--\r\n\r\n"It\'s the masters as has wrought this woe; it\'s the masters as\r\nshould pay for it.  Him as called me coward just now, may try if I\r\nam one or not.  Set me to serve out the masters, and see if there\'s\r\naught I\'ll stick at."\r\n\r\n"It would give the masters a bit on a fright if one of them were\r\nbeaten within an inch of his life," said one.\r\n\r\n"Ay! or beaten till no life were left in him," growled another.\r\n\r\nAnd so with words, or looks that told more than words, they built up\r\na deadly plan.  Deeper and darker grew the import of their speeches,\r\nas they stood hoarsely muttering their meaning out, and glaring with\r\neyes that told the terror their own thoughts were to them, upon\r\ntheir neighbours.  Their clenched fists, their set teeth, their\r\nlivid looks, all told the suffering which their minds were\r\nvoluntarily undergoing in the contemplation of crime, and in\r\nfamiliarising themselves with its details.\r\n\r\nThen came one of those fierce terrible oaths which bind members of\r\nTrades\' Unions to any given purpose.  Then under the flaring\r\ngaslight, they met together to consult further.  With the distrust\r\nof guilt, each was suspicious of his neighbour; each dreaded the\r\ntreachery of another.  A number of pieces of paper (the identical\r\nletter on which the caricature had been drawn that very morning)\r\nwere torn up, and one was marked.  Then all were folded up again,\r\nlooking exactly alike.  They were shuffled together in a hat.  The\r\ngas was extinguished; each drew out a paper.  The gas was\r\nre-lighted.  Then each went as far as he could from his fellows, and\r\nexamined the paper he had drawn without saying a word, and with a\r\ncountenance as stony and immovable as he could make it.\r\n\r\nThen, still rigidly silent, they each took up their hats and went\r\nevery one his own way.\r\n\r\nHe who had drawn the marked paper had drawn the lot of the assassin!\r\nand he had sworn to act according to his drawing!  But no one, save\r\nGod and his own conscience, knew who was the appointed murderer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII.   BARTON\'S NIGHT-ERRAND,\r\n\r\n     "Mournful is\'t to say Farewell,\r\n        Though for few brief hours we part;\r\n      In that absence, who can tell\r\n        What may come to wring the heart!"\r\n                                    --ANONYMOUS.\r\n\r\nThe events recorded in the last chapter took place on a Tuesday.  On\r\nThursday afternoon Mary was surprised, in the midst of some little\r\nbustle in which she was engaged, by the entrance of Will Wilson.  He\r\nlooked strange, at least it was strange to see any different\r\nexpression on his face to his usual joyous beaming appearance.  He\r\nhad a paper parcel in his hand.  He came in, and sat down, more\r\nquietly than usual.\r\n\r\n"Why, Will! what\'s the matter with you?  You seem quite cut up about\r\nsomething!"\r\n\r\n"And I am, Mary!  I\'m come to say good-bye; and few folk like to say\r\ngood-bye to them they love."\r\n\r\n"Good-bye!  Bless me, Will, that\'s sudden, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\nMary left off ironing, and came and stood near the fireplace.  She\r\nhad always liked Will; but now it seemed as if a sudden spring of\r\nsisterly love had gushed up in her heart, so sorry did she feel to\r\nhear of his approaching departure.\r\n\r\n"It\'s very sudden, isn\'t it?" said she, repeating the question.\r\n\r\n"Yes, it\'s very sudden," said he dreamily.  "No, it isn\'t"; rousing\r\nhimself to think of what he was saying.  "The captain told me in a\r\nfortnight he would be ready to sail again; but it comes very sudden\r\non me, I had got so fond of you all."\r\n\r\nMary understood the particular fondness that was thus generalised.\r\nShe spoke again.\r\n\r\n"But it\'s not a fortnight since you came.  Not a fortnight since you\r\nknocked at Jane Wilson\'s door, and I was there, you remember.\r\nNothing like a fortnight!"\r\n\r\n"No; I know it\'s not.  But, you see, I got a letter this afternoon\r\nfrom Jack Harris, to tell me our ship sails on Tuesday next; and\r\nit\'s long since I promised my uncle (my mother\'s brother, him that\r\nlives at Kirk-Christ, beyond Ramsay, in the Isle of Man) that I\'d go\r\nand see him and his, this time of coming ashore.  I must go.  I\'m\r\nsorry enough; but I mustn\'t slight poor mother\'s friends.  I must\r\ngo.  Don\'t try to keep me," said he, evidently fearing the strength\r\nof his own resolution, if hard pressed by entreaty.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not a-going, Will.  I dare say you\'re right; only I can\'t help\r\nfeeling sorry you\'re going away.  It seems so flat to be left\r\nbehind.  When do you go?"\r\n\r\n"To-night.  I shan\'t see you again."\r\n\r\n"To-night! and you go to Liverpool!  Maybe you and father will go\r\ntogether.  He\'s going to Glasgow, by way of Liverpool."\r\n\r\n"No!  I\'m walking; and I don\'t think your father will be up to\r\nwalking."\r\n\r\n"Well! and why on earth are you walking?  You can get by railway for\r\nthree-and-sixpence."\r\n\r\n"Ay, but Mary! (thou mustn\'t let out what I\'m going to tell thee) I\r\nhaven\'t got three shillings, no, nor even a sixpence left, at least,\r\nnot here; before I came I gave my landlady enough to carry me to the\r\nisland and back, and maybe a trifle for presents, and I brought the\r\nrest here; and it\'s all gone but this," jingling a few coppers in\r\nhis hand.\r\n\r\n"Nay, never fret over my walking a matter of thirty mile," added he,\r\nas he saw she looked grave and sorry.  "It\'s a fine clear night, and\r\nI shall set off betimes, and get in afore the Manx packet sails.\r\nWhere\'s your father going?  To Glasgow did you say?  Perhaps he and\r\nI may have a bit of a trip together then, for, if the Manx boat has\r\nsailed when I get into Liverpool, I shall go by a Scotch packet.\r\nWhat\'s he going to do in Glasgow?--Seek for work?  Trade is as bad\r\nthere as here, folk say."\r\n\r\n"No; he knows that," answered Mary sadly.  "I sometimes think he\'ll\r\nnever get work again, and that trade will never mend.  It\'s very\r\nhard to keep up one\'s heart.  I wish I were a boy, I\'d go to sea\r\nwith you.  It would be getting away from bad news at any rate; and\r\nnow, there\'s hardly a creature that crosses the door-step, but has\r\nsomething sad and unhappy to tell one.  Father is going as a\r\ndelegate from his Union, to ask help from the Glasgow folk.  He\'s\r\nstarting this evening."\r\n\r\nMary sighed, for the feeling again came over her that it was very\r\nflat to be left alone.\r\n\r\n"You say no one crosses the threshold but has something sad to say;\r\nyou don\'t mean that Margaret Jennings has any trouble?" asked the\r\nyoung sailor anxiously.\r\n\r\n"No!" replied Mary, smiling a little; "she\'s the only one I know, I\r\nbelieve, who seems free from care.  Her blindness almost appears a\r\nblessing sometimes; she was so down-hearted when she dreaded it, and\r\nnow she seems so calm and happy when it\'s downright come.  No!\r\nMargaret\'s happy, I do think."\r\n\r\n"I could almost wish it had been otherwise," said Will thoughtfully.\r\n"I could have been so glad to comfort her, and cherish her, if she\r\nhad been in trouble."\r\n\r\n"And why can\'t you cherish her, even though she is happy?" asked\r\nMary.\r\n\r\n"Oh! I don\'t know.  She seems so much better than I am!  And her\r\nvoice!  When I hear it, and think of the wishes that are in my\r\nheart, it seems as much out of place to ask her to be my wife, as it\r\nwould be to ask an angel from heaven."\r\n\r\nMary could not help laughing outright, in spite of her depression,\r\nat the idea of Margaret as an angel; it was so difficult (even to\r\nher dressmaking imagination) to fancy where, and how, the wings\r\nwould be fastened to the brown stuff gown, or the blue and yellow\r\nprint.\r\n\r\nWill laughed, too, a little, out of sympathy with Mary\'s pretty\r\nmerry laugh.  Then he said--\r\n\r\n"Ay, you may laugh, Mary: it only shows you\'ve never been in\r\nlove."\r\n\r\nIn an instant Mary was carnation colour, and the tears sprang to her\r\nsoft grey eyes.  She that was suffering so much from the doubts\r\narising from love!  It was unkind of him.  He did not notice her\r\nchange of look and of complexion.  He only noticed that she was\r\nsilent, so he continued--\r\n\r\n"I thought--I think, that when I come back from this voyage, I will\r\nspeak.  It\'s my fourth voyage in the same ship and with the same\r\ncaptain, and he\'s promised he\'ll make me a second mate after this\r\ntrip; then I shall have something to offer Margaret; and her\r\ngrandfather, and Aunt Alice, shall live with her, and keep her from\r\nbeing lonesome while I\'m at sea.  I\'m speaking as if she cared for\r\nme, and would marry me; d\'ye think she does care at all for me,\r\nMary?" asked he anxiously.\r\n\r\nMary had a very decided opinion of her own on the subject, but she\r\ndid not feel as if she had any right to give it.  So she said--\r\n\r\n"You must ask Margaret, not me, Will; she\'s never named your name to\r\nme."  His countenance fell.  "But I should say that was a good sign\r\nfrom a girl like her.  I\'ve no right to say what I think; but, if I\r\nwas you, I would not leave her now without speaking."\r\n\r\n"No! I cannot speak!  I have tried.  I\'ve been in to wish them\r\ngood-bye, and my voice stuck in my throat.  I could say nought of\r\nwhat I\'d planned to say; and I never thought of being so bold as to\r\noffer her marriage till I\'d been my next trip, and been made mate.\r\nI could not even offer her this box," said he, undoing his paper\r\nparcel and displaying a gaudily ornamented accordion; "I longed to\r\nbuy her something, and I thought, if it were something in the music\r\nline, she would maybe fancy it more.  So, will you give it to her,\r\nMary, when I\'m gone? and, if you can slip in something tender,--\r\nsomething, you know, of what I feel--maybe she would listen to you,\r\nMary."\r\n\r\nMary promised that she would do all that he asked.\r\n\r\n"I shall be thinking on her many and many a night, when I\'m keeping\r\nmy watch in mid-sea; I wonder if she will ever think on me when the\r\nwind is whistling, and the gale rising.  You\'ll often speak of me to\r\nher, Mary?  And if I should meet with any mischance, tell her how\r\ndear, how very dear, she was to me, and bid her, for the sake of one\r\nwho loved her well, try and comfort my poor aunt Alice.  Dear old\r\naunt! you and Margaret will often go and see her, won\'t you?  She\'s\r\nsadly failed since I was last ashore.  And so good as she has been!\r\nWhen I lived with her, a little wee chap, I used to be wakened by\r\nthe neighbours knocking her up; this one was ill, and that body\'s\r\nchild was restless; and for as tired as ever she might be, she would\r\nbe up and dressed in a twinkling, never thinking of the hard day\'s\r\nwash afore her next morning.  Them were happy times!  How pleased I\r\nused to be when she would take me into the fields with her to gather\r\nherbs!  I\'ve tasted tea in China since then, but it wasn\'t half so\r\ngood as the herb tea she used to make for me o\' Sunday nights.  And\r\nshe knew such a deal about plants and birds, and their ways.  She\r\nused to tell me long stories about her childhood, and we used to\r\nplan how we would go some time, please God (that was always her\r\nword), and live near her old home beyond Lancaster; in the very\r\ncottage where she was born, if we could get it.  Dear! and how\r\ndifferent it is!  Here is she still in a back street o\' Manchester,\r\nnever likely to see her own home again; and I, a sailor, off for\r\nAmerica next week.  I wish she had been able to go to Burton once\r\nafore she died."\r\n\r\n"She would maybe have found all sadly changed," said Mary, though\r\nher heart echoed Will\'s feeling.\r\n\r\n"Ay! ay! I dare say it\'s best.  One thing I do wish though, and I\r\nhave often wished it when out alone on the deep sea, when even the\r\nmost thoughtless can\'t choose but think on th\' past and th\' future;\r\nand that is, that I\'d never grieved her.  O Mary! many a hasty word\r\ncomes sorely back on the heart when one thinks one shall never see\r\nthe person whom one has grieved again!"\r\n\r\nThey both stood thinking.  Suddenly Mary started.\r\n\r\n"That\'s father\'s step.  And his shirt\'s not ready!"\r\n\r\nShe hurried to her irons, and tried to make up for lost time.\r\n\r\nJohn Barton came in.  Such a haggard and wildly anxious-looking man,\r\nWill thought he had never seen.  He looked at Will, but spoke no\r\nword of greeting or welcome.\r\n\r\n"I\'m come to bid you good-bye," said the sailor, and would in his\r\nsociable friendly humour have gone on speaking.  But John answered\r\nabruptly--\r\n\r\n"Good-bye to ye, then."\r\n\r\nThere was that in his manner which left no doubt of his desire to\r\nget rid of the visitor, and Will accordingly shook hands with Mary,\r\nand looked at John, as if doubting how far to offer to shake hands\r\nwith him.  But he met with no answering glance or gesture, so he\r\nwent his way, stopping for an instant at the door to say--\r\n\r\n"You\'ll think on me on Tuesday, Mary.  That\'s the day we shall hoist\r\nour blue Peter, Jack Harris says."\r\n\r\nMary was heartily sorry when the door closed; it seemed like\r\nshutting out a friendly sunbeam.  And her father! what could be the\r\nmatter with him?  He was so restless; not speaking (she wished he\r\nwould), but starting up and then sitting down, and meddling with her\r\nirons; he seemed so fierce, too, to judge from his face.  She\r\nwondered if he disliked Will being there; or if he were vexed to\r\nfind that she had not got further on with her work.  At last she\r\ncould bear his nervous way no longer, it made her equally nervous\r\nand fidgety.  She would speak.\r\n\r\n"When are you going, father?  I don\'t know the time o\' the trains."\r\n\r\n"And why shouldst thou know?" replied he gruffly.  "Meddle with thy\r\nironing, but donnot be asking questions about what doesn\'t concern\r\nthee."\r\n\r\n"I wanted to get you something to eat first," answered she gently.\r\n\r\n"Thou dost not know that I\'m larning to do without food," said he.\r\n\r\nMary looked at him to see if he spoke jestingly.  No! he looked\r\nsavagely grave.\r\n\r\nShe finished her bit of ironing, and began preparing the food she\r\nwas sure her father needed; for by this time her experience in the\r\ndegrees of hunger had taught her that his present irritability was\r\nincreased, if not caused by want of food.\r\n\r\nHe had had a sovereign given him to pay his expenses as delegate to\r\nGlasgow, and out of this he had given Mary a few shillings in the\r\nmorning; so she had been able to buy a sufficient meal, and now her\r\ncare was to cook it so as to tempt him.\r\n\r\n"If thou\'rt doing that for me, Mary, thou mayst spare thy labour.  I\r\ntelled thee I were not for eating."\r\n\r\n"Just a little bit, father, before starting," coaxed Mary\r\nperseveringly.\r\n\r\nAt that instant who should come in but Job Legh.  It was not often\r\nhe came, but when he did pay visits, Mary knew from past experience\r\nthey were anything but short.  Her father\'s countenance fell back\r\ninto the deep gloom from which it was but just emerging at the sound\r\nof Mary\'s sweet voice, and pretty pleading.  He became again\r\nrestless and fidgety, scarcely giving Job Legh the greeting\r\nnecessary for a host in his own house.  Job, however, did not stand\r\nupon ceremony.  He had come to pay a visit, and was not to be\r\ndaunted from his purpose.  He was interested in John Barton\'s\r\nmission to Glasgow, and wanted to hear all about it; so he sat down,\r\nand made himself comfortable, in a manner that Mary saw was meant to\r\nbe stationary.\r\n\r\n"So thou\'rt off to Glasgow, art thou?" he began his catechism.\r\n\r\n"Ay."\r\n\r\n"When art starting?"\r\n\r\n"To-night."\r\n\r\n"That I knowed.  But by what train?"\r\n\r\nThat was just what Mary wanted to know; but what apparently her\r\nfather was in no mood to tell.  He got up without speaking, and went\r\nupstairs.  Mary knew from his step, and his way, how much he was put\r\nout, and feared Job would see it too!  But no! Job seemed\r\nimperturbable.  So much the better, and perhaps she could cover her\r\nfather\'s rudeness by her own civility to so kind a friend.\r\n\r\nSo, half-listening to her father\'s movements upstairs (passionate,\r\nviolent, restless motions they were), and half-attending to Job\r\nLegh, she tried to pay him all due regard.\r\n\r\n"When does thy father start, Mary?"\r\n\r\nThat plaguing question again.\r\n\r\n"Oh! very soon.  I\'m just getting him a bit of supper.  Is Margaret\r\nvery well?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, she\'s well enough.  She\'s meaning to go and keep Alice Wilson\r\ncompany for an hour or so this evening: as soon as she thinks her\r\nnephew will have started for Liverpool; for she fancies the old\r\nwoman will feel a bit lonesome.  Th\' Union is paying for your\r\nfather, I suppose?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, they\'ve given him a sovereign.  You\'re one of th\' Union, Job?"\r\n\r\n"Ay! I\'m one, sure enough; but I\'m but a sleeping partner in the\r\nconcern.  I were obliged to become a member for peace, else I don\'t\r\ngo along with \'em.  Yo see they think themselves wise, and me silly,\r\nfor differing with them.  Well! there\'s no harm in that.  But then\r\nthey won\'t let me be silly in peace and quietness, but will force me\r\nto be as wise as they are; now that\'s not British liberty, I say.\r\nI\'m forced to be wise according to their notions, else they\r\nparsecute me, and sarve me out."\r\n\r\nWhat could her father be doing upstairs?  Tramping and banging\r\nabout.  Why did he not come down?  Or why did not Job go?  The\r\nsupper would be spoilt.\r\n\r\nBut Job had no notion of going.\r\n\r\n"You see my folly is this, Mary.  I would take what I could get; I\r\nthink half a loaf is better than no bread.  I would work for low\r\nwages rather than sit idle and starve.  But, comes the Trades\'\r\nUnion, and says, \'Well, if you take the half-loaf, we\'ll worry you\r\nout of your life.  Will you be clemmed, or will you be worried?\'\r\nNow clemming is a quiet death, and worrying isn\'t, so I choose\r\nclemming, and come into th\' Union.  But I\'d wish they\'d leave me\r\nfree, if I am a fool."\r\n\r\nCreak, creak, went the stairs.  Her father was coming down at last.\r\n\r\nYes, he came down, but more doggedly fierce than before, and made up\r\nfor his journey, too; with his little bundle on his arm.  He went up\r\nto Job, and, more civilly than Mary expected, wished him good-bye.\r\nHe then turned to her, and in a short cold manner, bade her\r\nfarewell.\r\n\r\n"Oh! father, don\'t go yet.  Your supper is all ready.  Stay one\r\nmoment."\r\n\r\nBut he pushed her away, and was gone.  She followed him to the door,\r\nher eyes blinded by sudden tears; she stood there looking after him.\r\nHe was so strange, so cold, so hard.  Suddenly, at the end of the\r\ncourt, he turned, and saw her standing there; he came back quickly,\r\nand took her in his arms.\r\n\r\n"God bless thee, Mary!--God in heaven bless thee, poor child!"  She\r\nthrew her arms round his neck.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t go yet, father; I can\'t bear you to go yet.  Come in, and eat\r\nsome supper; you look so ghastly; dear father, do!"\r\n\r\n"No," he said, faintly and mournfully.  "It\'s best as it is.  I\r\ncouldn\'t eat, and it\'s best to be off.  I cannot be still at home.\r\nI must be moving."\r\n\r\nSo saying, he unlaced her soft twining arms, and kissing her once\r\nmore, set off on his fierce errand.\r\n\r\nAnd he was out of sight!  She did not know why, but she had never\r\nbefore felt so depressed, so desolate.  She turned in to Job, who\r\nsat there still.  Her father, as soon as he was out of sight,\r\nslackened his pace, and fell into that heavy listless step which\r\ntold, as well as words could do, of hopelessness and weakness.  It\r\nwas getting dark, but he loitered on, returning no greeting to any\r\none.\r\n\r\nA child\'s cry caught his ear.  His thoughts were running on little\r\nTom; on the dead and buried child of happier years.  He followed the\r\nsound of the wail, that might have been HIS, and found a poor little\r\nmortal, who had lost his way, and whose grief had choked up his\r\nthoughts to the single want, "Mammy, mammy."  With tender address,\r\nJohn Barton soothed the little laddie, and with beautiful patience\r\nhe gathered fragments of meaning from the half-spoken words which\r\ncame mingled with sobs from the terrified little heart.  So, aided\r\nby inquiries here and there from a passer-by, he led and carried the\r\nlittle fellow home, where his mother had been too busy to miss him,\r\nbut now received him with thankfulness, and with an eloquent Irish\r\nblessing.  When John heard the words of blessing, he shook his head\r\nmournfully and turned away to retrace his steps.\r\n\r\nLet us leave him.\r\n\r\nMary took her sewing after he had gone, and sat on, and sat on,\r\ntrying to listen to Job, who was more inclined to talk than usual.\r\nShe had conquered her feeling of impatience towards him so far as to\r\nbe able to offer him her father\'s rejected supper; and she even\r\ntried to eat herself.  But her heart failed her.  A leaden weight\r\nseemed to hang over her; a sort of presentiment of evil, or perhaps\r\nonly an excess of low-spirited feeling in consequence of the two\r\ndepartures which had taken place that afternoon.\r\n\r\nShe wondered how long Job Legh would sit.  She did not like putting\r\ndown her work, and crying before him, and yet she had never in her\r\nlife longed so much to be alone in order to indulge in a good hearty\r\nburst of tears.\r\n\r\n"Well, Mary," she suddenly caught him saying, "I thought you\'d be a\r\nbit lonely to-night; and as Margaret were going to cheer th\' old\r\nwoman, I said I\'d go and keep th\' young un company; and a very\r\npleasant chatty evening we\'ve had; very.  Only I wonder as Margaret\r\nis not come back."\r\n\r\n"But perhaps she is," suggested Mary.\r\n\r\n"No, no, I took care o\' that.  Look ye here!" and he pulled out the\r\ngreat house-key.  "She\'ll have to stand waiting i\' th\' street, and\r\nthat I\'m sure she wouldn\'t do, when she knew where to find me."\r\n\r\n"Will she come back by hersel?" asked Mary.\r\n\r\n"Ay.  At first I were afraid o\' trusting her, and I used to follow\r\nher a bit behind; never letting on, of course.  But, bless you! she\r\ngoes along as steadily as can be; rather slow to be sure, and her\r\nhead a bit on one side, as if she were listening.  And it\'s real\r\nbeautiful to see her cross the road.  She\'ll wait above a bit to\r\nhear that all is still; not that she\'s so dark as not to see a coach\r\nor a cart like a big black thing, but she can\'t rightly judge how\r\nfar off it is by sight, so she listens.  Hark! that\'s her!"\r\n\r\nYes; in she came, with her usually calm face all tear-stained and\r\nsorrow-marked.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter, my wench?" said Job hastily.\r\n\r\n"O grandfather!  Alice Wilson\'s so bad!"  She could say no more for\r\nher breathless agitation.  The afternoon, and the parting with Will,\r\nhad weakened her nerves for any after-shock.\r\n\r\n"What is it?  Do tell us, Margaret!" said Mary, placing her in a\r\nchair, and loosening her bonnet-strings.\r\n\r\n"I think it\'s a stroke o\' the palsy.  Any rate she has lost the use\r\nof one side."\r\n\r\n"Was it afore Will set off?" asked Mary.\r\n\r\n"No, he were gone before I got there," said Margaret; "and she were\r\nmuch about as well as she has been for many a day.  She spoke a bit,\r\nbut not much; but that were only natural, for Mrs. Wilson likes to\r\nhave the talk to hersel, you know.  She got up to go across the\r\nroom, and then I heard a drag wi\' her leg, and presently a fall, and\r\nMrs. Wilson came running, and set up such a cry!  I stopped wi\'\r\nAlice, while she fetched a doctor; but she could not speak, to\r\nanswer me, though she tried, I think."\r\n\r\n"Where was Jem?  Why didn\'t he go for the doctor?"\r\n\r\n"He were out when I got there, and he never came home while I\r\nstopped."\r\n\r\n"Thou\'st never left Mrs. Wilson alone wi\' poor Alice?" asked Job\r\nhastily.\r\n\r\n"No, no," said Margaret.  "But oh! grandfather, it\'s now I feel how\r\nhard it is to have lost my sight.  I should have so loved to nurse\r\nher; and I did try, until I found I did more harm than good.  O\r\ngrandfather; if I could but see!"\r\n\r\nShe sobbed a little; and they let her give that ease to her heart.\r\nThen she went on--\r\n\r\n"No!  I went round by Mrs. Davenport\'s, and she were hard at work;\r\nbut, the minute I told my errand, she were ready and willing to go\r\nto Jane Wilson, and stop up all night with Alice."\r\n\r\n"And what does the doctor say?" asked Mary.\r\n\r\n"Oh! much what all doctors say: he puts a fence on this side, and\r\na fence on that, for fear he should be caught tripping in his\r\njudgment.  One moment he does not think there\'s much hope--but while\r\nthere is life there is hope! th\' next he says he should think she\r\nmight recover partial--but her age is again her.  He\'s ordered her\r\nleeches to her head."\r\n\r\nMargaret having told her tale, leant back with weariness, both of\r\nbody and mind.  Mary hastened to make her a cup of tea; while Job,\r\nlately so talkative, sat quiet and mournfully silent.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll go first thing to-morrow morning, and learn how she is; and\r\nI\'ll bring word back before I go to work," said Mary.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a bad job Will\'s gone," said Job.\r\n\r\n"Jane does not think she knows any one," replied Margaret.  "It\'s\r\nperhaps as well he shouldn\'t see her now for they say her face is\r\nsadly drawn.  He\'ll remember her with her own face better, if he\r\ndoes not see her again."\r\n\r\nWith a few more sorrowful remarks they separated for the night, and\r\nMary was left alone in her house, to meditate on the heavy day that\r\nhad passed over her head.  Everything seemed going wrong.  Will\r\ngone; her father gone--and so strangely too!  And to a place so\r\nmysteriously distant as Glasgow seemed to be to her!  She had felt\r\nhis presence as a protection against Harry Carson and his threats;\r\nand now she dreaded lest he should learn she was alone.  Her heart\r\nbegan to despair, too, about Jem.  She feared he had ceased to love\r\nher; and she--she only loved him more and more for his seeming\r\nneglect.  And, as if all this aggregate of sorrowful thoughts was\r\nnot enough, here was this new woe, of poor Alice\'s paralytic stroke.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII.   MURDER.\r\n\r\n     "But in his pulse there was no throb,\r\n      Nor on his lips one dying sob;\r\n      Sigh, nor word, nor struggling breath\r\n      Heralded his way to death."\r\n                          --"SIEGE OF CORINTH."\r\n\r\n     "My brain runs this way and that way; \'t will not fix\r\n      On aught but vengeance."\r\n                          --"DUKE OF GUISE."\r\n\r\nI must now go back to an hour or two before Mary and her friends\r\nparted for the night.  It might be about eight o\'clock that evening,\r\nand the three Miss Carsons were sitting in their father\'s\r\ndrawing-room.  He was asleep in the dining-room, in his own\r\ncomfortable chair.  Mrs. Carson was (as was usual with her, when no\r\nparticular excitement was going on) very poorly, and sitting\r\nupstairs in her dressing-room, indulging in the luxury of a\r\nheadache.  She was not well, certainly.  "Wind in the head," the\r\nservants called it.  But it was but the natural consequence of the\r\nstate of mental and bodily idleness in which she was placed.\r\nWithout education enough to value the resources of wealth and\r\nleisure, she was so circumstanced as to command both.  It would have\r\ndone her more good than all the ether and sal-volatile she was daily\r\nin the habit of swallowing, if she might have taken the work of one\r\nof her own housemaids for a week; made beds, rubbed tables, shaken\r\ncarpets, and gone out into the fresh morning air, without all the\r\nparaphernalia of shawl, cloak, boa, fur boots, bonnet, and veil, in\r\nwhich she was equipped before setting out for an "airing," in the\r\nclosely shut-up carriage.\r\n\r\nSo the three girls were by themselves in the comfortable, elegant,\r\nwell-lighted drawing-room; and, like many similarly situated young\r\nladies, they did not exactly know what to do to while away the time\r\nuntil the tea-hour.  The elder two had been at a dancing-party the\r\nnight before, and were listless and sleepy in consequence.  One\r\ntried to read "Emerson\'s Essays," and fell asleep in the attempt;\r\nthe other was turning over a parcel of new songs, in order to select\r\nwhat she liked.  Amy, the youngest, was copying some manuscript\r\nmusic.  The air was heavy with the fragrance of strongly-scented\r\nflowers, which sent out their night odours from an adjoining\r\nconservatory.\r\n\r\nThe clock on the chimney-piece chimed eight.  Sophy (the sleeping\r\nsister) started up at the sound.\r\n\r\n"What o\'clock is that?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"Eight," said Amy.\r\n\r\n"O dear! how tired I am!  Is Harry come in?  Tea will rouse one up a\r\nlittle.  Are you not worn out, Helen?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; I am tired enough.  One is good for nothing the day after a\r\ndance.  Yet I don\'t feel weary at the time; I suppose it is the\r\nlateness of the hours."\r\n\r\n"And yet, how could it be managed otherwise?  So many don\'t dine\r\ntill five or six, that one cannot begin before eight or nine; and\r\nthen it takes a long time to get into the spirit of the evening.  It\r\nis always more pleasant after supper than before."\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'m too tired to-night to reform the world in the matter of\r\ndances or balls.  What are you copying, Amy?"\r\n\r\n"Only that little Spanish air you sing, \'Quien quiera.\'"\r\n\r\n"What are you copying it for?" asked Helen.\r\n\r\n"Harry asked me to do it for him this morning at breakfast-time--for\r\nMiss Richardson, he said."\r\n\r\n"For Jane Richardson!" said Sophy, as if a new idea were receiving\r\nstrength in her mind.\r\n\r\n"Do you think Harry means anything by his attention to her?" asked\r\nHelen.\r\n\r\n"Nay, I do not know anything more than you do; I can only observe\r\nand conjecture.  What do you think, Helen?"\r\n\r\n"Harry always likes to be of consequence to the belle of the room.\r\nIf one girl is more admired than another, he likes to flutter about\r\nher, and seem to be on intimate terms with her.  That is his way,\r\nand I have not noticed anything beyond that in his manner to Jane\r\nRichardson."\r\n\r\n"But I don\'t think she knows it\'s only his way.  Just watch her the\r\nnext time we meet her when Harry is there, and see how she crimsons,\r\nand looks another way when she feels he is coming up to her.  I\r\nthink he sees it, too, and I think he is pleased with it."\r\n\r\n"I dare say Harry would like well enough to turn the head of such a\r\nlovely girl as Jane Richardson.  But I\'m not convinced that he\'s in\r\nlove, whatever she may be."\r\n\r\n"Well, then!" said Sophy indignantly, "though it is our own brother,\r\nI do not think he is behaving very wrongly.  The more I think of it,\r\nthe more sure I am that she thinks he means something, and that he\r\nintends her to think so.  And then, when he leaves off paying her\r\nattention"--\r\n\r\n"Which will be as soon as a prettier girl makes her appearance,"\r\ninterrupted Helen.\r\n\r\n"As soon as he leaves off paying her attention," resumed Sophy, "she\r\nwill have many and many a heartache, and then she will harden\r\nherself into being a flirt, a feminine flirt, as he is a masculine\r\nflirt.  Poor girl!"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t like to hear you speak so of Harry," said Amy, looking up\r\nat Sophy.\r\n\r\n"And I don\'t like to have to speak so, Amy, for I love him dearly.\r\nHe is a good, kind brother, but I do think him vain, and I think he\r\nhardly knows the misery, the crime, to which indulged vanity may\r\nlead him."\r\n\r\nHelen yawned.\r\n\r\n"Oh! do you think we may ring for tea?  Sleeping after dinner makes\r\nme so feverish."\r\n\r\n"Yes, surely.  Why should not we?" said the more energetic Sophy,\r\npulling the bell with some determination.\r\n\r\n"Tea, directly, Parker," said she authoritatively, as the man\r\nentered the room.\r\n\r\nShe was too little in the habit of reading expressions on the faces\r\nof others to notice Parker\'s countenance,\r\n\r\nYet it was striking.  It was blanched to a dead whiteness; the lips\r\ncompressed as if to keep within some tale of horror; the eyes\r\ndistended and unnatural.  It was a terror-stricken face.\r\n\r\nThe girls began to put away their music and books, in preparation\r\nfor tea.  The door slowly opened again, and this time it was the\r\nnurse who entered.  I call her nurse, for such had been her office\r\nin bygone days, though now she held rather an anomalous situation in\r\nthe family.  Seamstress, attendant on the young ladies, keeper of\r\nthe stores; only "Nurse" was still her name.  She had lived longer\r\nwith them than any other servant, and to her their manner was far\r\nless haughty than to the other domestics.  She occasionally came\r\ninto the drawing-room to look for things belonging to their father\r\nor mother, so it did not excite any surprise when she advanced into\r\nthe room.  They went on arranging their various articles of\r\nemployment.\r\n\r\nShe wanted them to look up.  She wanted them to read something in\r\nher face--her face so full of woe, of horror.  But they went on\r\nwithout taking any notice.  She coughed; not a natural cough; but\r\none of those coughs which asks so plainly for remark.\r\n\r\n"Dear nurse, what is the matter?" asked Amy.  "Are not you well?"\r\n\r\n"Is mamma ill?" asked Sophy quickly.\r\n\r\n"Speak, speak, nurse!" said they all, as they saw her efforts to\r\narticulate choked by the convulsive rising in her throat.  They\r\nclustered round her with eager faces, catching a glimpse of some\r\nterrible truth to be revealed.\r\n\r\n"My dear young ladies! my dear girls!" she gasped out at length, and\r\nthen she burst into tears.\r\n\r\n"Oh! do tell us what it is, nurse!" said one.  "Anything is better\r\nthan this.  Speak!"\r\n\r\n"My children! I don\'t know how to break it to you.  My dears, poor\r\nMr. Harry is brought home"--\r\n\r\n"Brought home--BROUGHT home--how?"  Instinctively they sank their\r\nvoices to a whisper; but a fearful whisper it was.  In the same low\r\ntone, as if afraid lest the walls, the furniture, the inanimate\r\nthings which told of preparation for life and comfort, should hear,\r\nshe answered--\r\n\r\n"Dead!"\r\n\r\nAmy clutched her nurse\'s arm, and fixed her eyes on her as if to\r\nknow if such a tale could be true; and when she read its\r\nconfirmation in those sad, mournful, unflinching eyes, she sank,\r\nwithout word or sound, down in a faint upon the floor.  One sister\r\nsat down on an ottoman, and covered her face, to try and realise it.\r\nThat was Sophy.  Helen threw herself on the sofa, and burying her\r\nhead in the pillows, tried to stifle the screams and moans which\r\nshook her frame.\r\n\r\nThe nurse stood silent.  She had not told ALL.\r\n\r\n"Tell me," said Sophy, looking up, and speaking in a hoarse voice,\r\nwhich told of the inward pain, "tell me, nurse!  Is he DEAD, did you\r\nsay?  Have you sent for a doctor?  Oh! send for one, send for one,"\r\ncontinued she, her voice rising to shrillness, and starting to her\r\nfeet.  Helen lifted herself up, and looked, with breathless waiting,\r\ntowards nurse.\r\n\r\n"My dears, he is dead!  But I have sent for a doctor.  I have done\r\nall I could."\r\n\r\n"When did he--when did they bring him home?" asked Sophy.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps ten minutes ago.  Before you rang for Parker."\r\n\r\n"How did he die?  Where did they find him?  He looked so well.  He\r\nalways seemed so strong.  Oh! are you sure he is dead?"\r\n\r\nShe went towards the door.  Nurse laid her hand on her arm.\r\n\r\n"Miss Sophy, I have not told you all.  Can you bear to hear it?\r\nRemember, master is in the next room, and he knows nothing yet.\r\nCome, you must help me to tell him.  Now, be quiet, dear!  It was no\r\ncommon death he died!"  She looked in her face as if trying to\r\nconvey her meaning by her eyes.\r\n\r\nSophy\'s lips moved, but nurse could hear no sound.\r\n\r\n"He has been shot as he was coming home along Turner Street,\r\nto-night."\r\n\r\nSophy went on with the motion of her lips, twitching them almost\r\nconvulsively.\r\n\r\n"My dear, you must rouse yourself, and remember your father and\r\nmother have yet to be told.  Speak! Miss Sophy!"\r\n\r\nBut she could not; her whole face worked involuntarily.  The nurse\r\nleft the room, and almost immediately brought back some sal-volatile\r\nand water.  Sophy drank it eagerly, and gave one or two deep gasps.\r\nThen she spoke in a calm, unnatural voice.\r\n\r\n"What do you want me to do, nurse?  Go to Helen and poor Amy.  See,\r\nthey want help."\r\n\r\n"Poor creatures! we must let them alone for a bit.  You must go to\r\nmaster; that\'s what I want you to do, Miss Sophy.  You must break it\r\nto him, poor old gentleman!  Come, he\'s asleep in the dining-room,\r\nand the men are waiting to speak to him."\r\n\r\nSophy went mechanically to the dining-room door.\r\n\r\n"Oh! I cannot go in.  I cannot tell him.  What must I say?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll come with you, Miss Sophy.  Break it to him by degrees."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t, nurse.  My head throbs so, I shall be sure to say the\r\nwrong thing."\r\n\r\nHowever, she opened the door.  There sat her father, the shaded\r\nlight of the candle-lamp falling upon, and softening his marked\r\nfeatures, while his snowy hair contrasted well with the deep crimson\r\nmorocco of the chair.  The newspaper he had been reading had dropped\r\non the carpet by his side.  He breathed regularly and deeply.\r\n\r\nAt that instant the words of Mrs. Hemans\'s song came full in Sophy\'s\r\nmind--\r\n\r\n     "Ye know not what ye do,\r\n        That call the slumberer back\r\n      From the realms unseen by you,\r\n        To life\'s dim weary track."\r\n\r\nBut this life\'s track would be to the bereaved father something more\r\nthan dim and weary, hereafter.\r\n\r\n"Papa," said she softly.  He did not stir.\r\n\r\n"Papa!" she exclaimed, somewhat louder.\r\n\r\nHe started up, half awake.\r\n\r\n"Tea is ready, is it?" and he yawned.\r\n\r\n"No! papa, but something very dreadful--very sad, has happened!"\r\n\r\nHe was gaping so loud that he did not catch the words she uttered,\r\nand did not see the expression of her face.\r\n\r\n"Master Henry has not come back," said nurse.  Her voice, heard in\r\nunusual speech to him, arrested his attention, and rubbing his eyes,\r\nhe looked at the servant.\r\n\r\n"Harry! oh, no! he had to attend a meeting of the masters about\r\nthese cursed turn-outs.  I don\'t expect him yet.  What are you\r\nlooking at me so strangely for, Sophy?"\r\n\r\n"O papa, Harry is come back," said she, bursting into tears.\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?" said he, startled into an impatient\r\nconsciousness that something was wrong.  "One of you says he is not\r\ncome home, and the other says he is.  Now, that\'s nonsense!  Tell me\r\nat once what\'s the matter.  Did he go on horseback to town?  Is he\r\nthrown?  Speak, child, can\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"No! he\'s not been thrown, papa," said Sophy sadly.\r\n\r\n"But he\'s badly hurt," put in the nurse, desirous to be drawing his\r\nanxiety to a point.\r\n\r\n"Hurt?  Where?  How?  Have you sent for a doctor?" said he, hastily\r\nrising, as if to leave the room.\r\n\r\n"Yes, papa, we\'ve sent for a doctor--but I\'m afraid---I believe it\'s\r\nof no use."\r\n\r\nHe looked at her for a moment, and in her face he read the truth.\r\nHis son, his only son, was dead.\r\n\r\nHe sank back in his chair, and hid his face in his hands, and bowed\r\nhis head upon the table.  The strong mahogany dining-table shook and\r\nrattled under his agony.\r\n\r\nSophy went and put her arms round his bowed neck.\r\n\r\n"Go! you are not Harry," said he; but the action roused him.\r\n\r\n"Where is he? where is the"--said he, with his strong face set into\r\nthe lines of anguish, by two minutes of such intense woe.\r\n\r\n"In the servants\' hall," said nurse.  "Two policemen and another man\r\nbrought him home.  They would be glad to speak to you when you are\r\nable, sir."\r\n\r\n"I am now able," replied he.  At first when he stood up he tottered.\r\nBut steadying himself, he walked, as firmly as a soldier on drill,\r\nto the door.  Then he turned back and poured out a glass of wine\r\nfrom the decanter which yet remained on the table.  His eye caught\r\nthe wine-glass which Harry had used but two or three hours before.\r\nHe sighed a long quivering sigh, and then mastering himself again,\r\nhe left the room.\r\n\r\n"You had better go back to your sisters, Miss Sophy," said nurse.\r\n\r\nMiss Carson went.  She could not face death yet.\r\n\r\nThe nurse followed Mr. Carson to the servants\' hall.  There on their\r\ndinner-table lay the poor dead body.  The men who had brought it\r\nwere sitting near the fire, while several of the servants stood\r\nround the table, gazing at the remains.\r\n\r\nTHE REMAINS!\r\n\r\nOne or two were crying; one or two were whispering; awed into a\r\nstrange stillness of voice and action by the presence of the dead.\r\nWhen Mr. Carson came in they all drew back and looked at him with\r\nthe reverence due to sorrow.\r\n\r\nHe went forward and gazed long and fondly on the calm, dead face;\r\nthen he bent down and kissed the lips yet crimson with life.  The\r\npolicemen had advanced, and stood ready to be questioned.  But at\r\nfirst the old man\'s mind could only take in the idea of death;\r\nslowly, slowly came the conception of violence, of murder.  "How did\r\nhe die?" he groaned forth.\r\n\r\nThe policemen looked at each other.  Then one began, and stated that\r\nhaving heard the report of a gun in Turner Street, he had turned\r\ndown that way (a lonely, unfrequented way Mr. Carson knew, but a\r\nshort cut to his garden door, of which Harry had a key); that as he\r\n(the policeman) came nearer, he had heard footsteps as of a man\r\nrunning away; but the evening was so dark (the moon not having yet\r\nrisen) that he could see no one twenty yards off.  That he had even\r\nbeen startled when close to the body by seeing it lying across the\r\npath at his feet.  That he had sprung his rattle; and when another\r\npoliceman came up, by the light of the lantern they had discovered\r\nwho it was that had been killed.  That they believed him to be dead\r\nwhen they first took him up, as he had never moved, spoken, or\r\nbreathed.  That intelligence of the murder had been sent to the\r\nsuperintendent, who would probably soon be here.  That two or three\r\npolicemen were still about the place where the murder was committed,\r\nseeking out for some trace of the murderer.  Having said this, they\r\nstopped speaking.\r\n\r\nMr. Carson had listened attentively, never taking his eyes off the\r\ndead body.  When they had ended, he said--\r\n\r\n"Where was he shot?"\r\n\r\nThey lifted up some of the thick chestnut curls, and showed a blue\r\nspot (you could hardly call it a hole, the flesh had closed so much\r\nover it) in the left temple.  A deadly aim! And yet it was so dark a\r\nnight!\r\n\r\n"He must have been close upon him," said one policeman.\r\n\r\n"And have had him between him and the sky," added the other.\r\n\r\nThere was a little commotion at the door of the room, and there\r\nstood poor Mrs. Carson, the mother.\r\n\r\nShe had heard unusual noises in the house, and had sent down her\r\nmaid (much more a companion to her than her highly-educated\r\ndaughters) to discover what was going on.  But the maid either\r\nforgot, or dreaded, to return; and with nervous impatience Mrs.\r\nCarson came down herself, and had traced the hum and buzz of voices\r\nto the servants\' hall.\r\n\r\nMr. Carson turned round.  But he could not leave the dead for any\r\none living.\r\n\r\n"Take her away, nurse.  It is no sight for her.  Tell Miss Sophy to\r\ngo to her mother."  His eyes were again fixed on the dead face of\r\nhis son.\r\n\r\nPresently Mrs. Carson\'s hysterical cries were heard all over the\r\nhouse.  Her husband shuddered at the outward expression of the agony\r\nwhich was rending his heart.\r\n\r\nThen the police superintendent came, and after him the doctor.  The\r\nlatter went through all the forms of ascertaining death, without\r\nuttering a word, and when at the conclusion of the operation of\r\nopening a vein, from which no blood flowed, he shook his head, all\r\npresent understood the confirmation of their previous belief.  The\r\nsuperintendent asked to speak to Mr. Carson in private.\r\n\r\n"It was just what I was going to request of you," answered he; so he\r\nled the way into the dining-room, with the wine-glass still on the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\nThe door was carefully shut, and both sat down, each apparently\r\nwaiting for the other to begin.\r\n\r\nAt last Mr. Carson spoke.\r\n\r\n"You probably have heard that I am a rich man."\r\n\r\nThe superintendent bowed in assent.\r\n\r\n"Well, sir, half--nay, if necessary, the whole of my fortune I will\r\ngive to have the murderer brought to the gallows."\r\n\r\n"Every exertion, you may be sure, sir, shall be used on our part;\r\nbut probably offering a handsome reward might accelerate the\r\ndiscovery of the murderer.  But what I wanted particularly to tell\r\nyou, sir, is that one of my men has already got some clue, and that\r\nanother (who accompanied me here) has within this quarter of an hour\r\nfound a gun in the field which the murderer crossed, and which he\r\nprobably threw away when pursued, as encumbering his flight.  I have\r\nnot the smallest doubt of discovering the murderer."\r\n\r\n"What do you call a handsome reward?" said Mr. Carson.\r\n\r\n"Well, sir, three, or five hundred pounds is a munificent reward:\r\nmore than will probably be required as a temptation to any\r\naccomplice."\r\n\r\n"Make it a thousand," said Mr. Carson decisively.  "It\'s the doing\r\nof those damned turn-outs."\r\n\r\n"I imagine not," said the superintendent.  "Some days ago the man I\r\nwas naming to you before, reported to the inspector when he came on\r\nhis beat, that he had to separate your son from a young man, who by\r\nhis dress he believed to be employed in a foundry; that the man had\r\nthrown Mr. Carson down, and seemed inclined to proceed to more\r\nviolence, when the policeman came up and interfered.  Indeed, my man\r\nwished to give him in charge for an assault, but Mr. Carson would\r\nnot allow that to be done."\r\n\r\n"Just like him!--noble fellow!" murmured the father.\r\n\r\n"But after your son had left, the man made use of some pretty strong\r\nthreats.  And it\'s rather a curious coincidence that this scuffle\r\ntook place in the very same spot where the murder was committed; in\r\nTurner Street."\r\n\r\nThere was some one knocking at the door of the room.  It was Sophy,\r\nwho beckoned her father out, and then asked him, in an awestruck\r\nwhisper, to come upstairs and speak to her mother.\r\n\r\n"She will not leave Harry, and talks so strangely.  Indeed--indeed--\r\npapa, I think she has lost her senses."\r\n\r\nAnd the poor girl sobbed bitterly.\r\n\r\n"Where is she?" asked Mr. Carson.\r\n\r\n"In his room."\r\n\r\nThey went upstairs rapidly and silently.  It was a large comfortable\r\nbedroom; too large to be well lighted by the flaring, flickering\r\nkitchen-candle which had been hastily snatched up, and now stood on\r\nthe dressing-table.\r\n\r\nOn the bed, surrounded by its heavy, pall-like green curtains, lay\r\nthe dead son.  They had carried him up, and laid him down, as\r\ntenderly as though they feared to waken him; and, indeed, it looked\r\nmore like sleep than death, so very calm and full of repose was the\r\nface.  You saw, too, the chiselled beauty of the features much more\r\nperfectly than when the brilliant colouring of life had distracted\r\nyour attention.  There was a peace about him which told that death\r\nhad come too instantaneously to give any previous pain.\r\n\r\nIn a chair, at the head of the bed, sat the mother--smiling.  She\r\nheld one of the hands (rapidly stiffening, even in her warm grasp),\r\nand gently stroked the back of it, with the endearing caress she had\r\nused to all her children when young.\r\n\r\n"I am glad you are come," said she, looking up at her husband, and\r\nstill smiling.  "Harry is so full of fun, he always has something\r\nnew to amuse us with; and now he pretends he is asleep, and that we\r\ncan\'t waken him.  Look! he is smiling now; he hears I have found him\r\nout.  Look!"\r\n\r\nAnd, in truth, the lips, in the rest of death, did look as though\r\nthey wore a smile, and the waving light of the unsnuffed candle\r\nalmost made them seem to move.\r\n\r\n"Look, Amy," said she to her youngest child, who knelt at her feet,\r\ntrying to soothe her, by kissing her garments.\r\n\r\n"Oh, he was always a rogue!  You remember, don\'t you, love? how full\r\nof play he was as a baby; hiding his face under my arm, when you\r\nwanted to play with him.  Always a rogue, Harry!"\r\n\r\n"We must get her away, sir," said nurse; "you know there is much to\r\nbe done before"--\r\n\r\n"I understand, nurse." said the father, hastily interrupting her in\r\ndread of the distinct words which would tell of the changes of\r\nmortality.\r\n\r\n"Come, love," said he to his wife.  "I want you to come with me.  I\r\nwant to speak to you downstairs."\r\n\r\n"I\'m coming," said she, rising; "perhaps, after all, nurse, he\'s\r\nreally tired, and would be glad to sleep.  Don\'t let him get cold,\r\nthough,--he feels rather chilly," continued she, after she had bent\r\ndown, and kissed the pale lips.\r\n\r\nHer husband put his arm around her waist, and they left the room.\r\nThen the three sisters burst into unrestrained wailings.  They were\r\nstartled into the reality of life and death.  And yet in the midst\r\nof shrieks and moans, of shivering and chattering of teeth, Sophy\'s\r\neye caught the calm beauty of the dead; so calm amidst such\r\nviolence, and she hushed her emotion.\r\n\r\n"Come," said she to her sisters, "nurse wants us to go; and besides,\r\nwe ought to be with mamma.  Papa told the man he was talking to,\r\nwhen I went for him, to wait, and she must not be left."\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the superintendent had taken a candle, and was examining\r\nthe engravings that hung round the dining-room.  It was so common to\r\nhim to be acquainted with crime, that he was far from feeling all\r\nhis interest absorbed in the present case of violence, although he\r\ncould not help having much anxiety to detect the murderer.  He was\r\nbusy looking at the only oil-painting in the room (a youth of\r\neighteen or so, in a fancy dress), and conjecturing its identity\r\nwith the young man so mysteriously dead, when the door opened, and\r\nMr. Carson returned.  Stern as he had looked before leaving the\r\nroom, he looked far sterner now.  His face was hardened into\r\ndeep-purposed wrath.\r\n\r\n"I beg your pardon, sir, for leaving you."  The superintendent\r\nbowed.  They sat down, and spoke long together.  One by one the\r\npolicemen were called in, and questioned.\r\n\r\nAll through the night there was bustle and commotion in the house.\r\nNobody thought of going to bed.  It seemed strange to Sophy to hear\r\nnurse summoned from her mother\'s side to supper, in the middle of\r\nthe night, and still stranger that she could go.  The necessity of\r\neating and drinking seemed out of place in the house of death.\r\n\r\nWhen night was passing into morning, the dining-room door opened, and\r\ntwo persons\' steps were heard along the hall.  The superintendent\r\nwas leaving at last.  Mr. Carson stood on the front-door step,\r\nfeeling the refreshment of the caller morning air, and seeing the\r\nstarlight fade away into dawn.\r\n\r\n"You will not forget," said he.  "I trust to you."  The policeman\r\nbowed.\r\n\r\n"Spare no money.  The only purpose for which I now value wealth is\r\nto have the murderer arrested, and brought to justice.  My hope in\r\nlife now is to see him sentenced to death.  Offer any rewards.  Name\r\na thousand pounds in the placards.  Come to me at any hour, night or\r\nday, if that be required.  All I ask of you is, to get the murderer\r\nhanged.  Next week, if possible--to-day is Friday.  Surely with the\r\nclues you already possess, you can muster up evidence sufficient to\r\nhave him tried next week."\r\n\r\n"He may easily request an adjournment of his trial, on the ground of\r\nthe shortness of the notice," said the superintendent.\r\n\r\n"Oppose it, if possible.  I will see that the first lawyers are\r\nemployed.  I shall know no rest while he lives."\r\n\r\n"Everything shall be done, sir."\r\n\r\n"You will arrange with the coroner.  Ten o\'clock if convenient."\r\n\r\nThe superintendent took leave.\r\n\r\nMr. Carson stood on the step, dreading to shut out the light and\r\nair, and return into the haunted, gloomy house.\r\n\r\n"My son! my son!" he said at last.  "But you shall be avenged, my\r\npoor murdered boy."\r\n\r\nAy! to avenge his wrongs the murderer had singled out his victim,\r\nand with one fell action had taken away the life that God had given.\r\nTo avenge his child\'s death, the old man lived on; with the single\r\npurpose in his heart of vengeance on the murderer.  True, his\r\nvengeance was sanctioned by law, but was it the less revenge?\r\n\r\nAre ye worshippers of Christ? or of Alecto?\r\n\r\nOh! Orestes, you would have made a very tolerable Christian of the\r\nnineteenth century!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX.   JEM WILSON ARRESTED ON SUSPICION,\r\n\r\n     "Deeds to be hid which were not hid,\r\n      Which, all confused, I could not know,\r\n      Whether I suffered or I did,\r\n      For all seemed guilt, remorse, or woe."\r\n                                    --COLERIDGE.\r\n\r\nI left Mary, on that same Thursday night which left its burden of\r\nwoe at Mr. Carson\'s threshold, haunted with depressing thoughts.\r\nAll through the night she tossed restlessly about, trying to get\r\nquit of the ideas that harassed her, and longing for the light when\r\nshe could rise, and find some employment.  But just as dawn began to\r\nappear, she became more quiet, and fell into a sound heavy sleep,\r\nwhich lasted till she was sure it was late in the morning, by the\r\nfull light that shone in.\r\n\r\nShe dressed hastily, and heard the neighbouring church clock strike\r\neight.  It was far too late to do as she had planned (after\r\ninquiring how Alice was, to return and tell Margaret), and she\r\naccordingly went in to inform the latter of her change of purpose,\r\nand the cause of it; but on entering the house she found Job sitting\r\nalone, looking sad enough.  She told him what she came for.\r\n\r\n"Margaret, wench! why, she\'s been gone to Wilson\'s these two hours.\r\nAy! sure, you did say last night you would go; but she could na rest\r\nin her bed, so was off betimes this morning."\r\n\r\nMary could do nothing but feel guilty of her long morning nap, and\r\nhasten to follow Margaret\'s steps; for late as it was, she felt she\r\ncould not settle well to her work, unless she learnt how kind good\r\nAlice Wilson was going on.\r\n\r\nSo, eating her crust-of-bread breakfast, she passed rapidly along\r\nthe street.  She remembered afterwards the little groups of people\r\nshe had seen, eagerly hearing, and imparting news; but at the time\r\nher only care was to hasten on her way, in dread of a reprimand from\r\nMiss Simmonds.\r\n\r\nShe went into the house at Jane Wilson\'s, her heart at the instant\r\ngiving a strange knock, and sending the rosy flush into her face, at\r\nthe thought that Jem might possibly be inside the door.  But I do\r\nassure you, she had not thought of it before.  Impatient and loving\r\nas she was, her solicitude about Alice on that hurried morning had\r\nnot been mingled with any thought of him.\r\n\r\nHer heart need not have leaped, her colour need not have rushed so\r\npainfully to her cheeks, for he was not there.  There was the round\r\ntable, with a cup and saucer, which had evidently been used, and\r\nthere was Jane Wilson sitting on the other side, crying quietly,\r\nwhile she ate her breakfast with a sort of unconscious appetite.\r\nAnd there was Mrs. Davenport washing away at a night-cap or so,\r\nwhich, by their simple, old-world make, Mary knew at a glance were\r\nAlice\'s.  But nothing--no one else.\r\n\r\nAlice was much the same, or rather better of the two, they told her:\r\nat any rate she could speak, though it was sad rambling talk.  Would\r\nMary like to see her?\r\n\r\nOf course she would.  Many are interested by seeing their friends\r\nunder the new aspect of illness; and among the poor there is no\r\nwholesome fear of injury or excitement to restrain this wish.\r\n\r\nSo Mary went upstairs, accompanied by Mrs. Davenport, wringing the\r\nsuds off her hands, and speaking in a loud whisper far more audible\r\nthan her usual voice.\r\n\r\n"I mun be hastening home, but I\'ll come again to-night, time enough\r\nto iron her cap; \'twould be a sin and a shame if we let her go dirty\r\nnow she\'s ill, when she\'s been so rare and clean all her life long.\r\nBut she\'s sadly forsaken, poor thing!  She\'ll not know you, Mary;\r\nshe knows none of us."\r\n\r\nThe room upstairs held two beds, one superior in the grandeur of\r\nfour posts and checked curtains to the other, which had been\r\noccupied by the twins in their brief lifetime.  The smaller had been\r\nAlice\'s bed since she had lived there; but with the natural\r\nreverence to one "stricken of God and afflicted," she had been\r\ninstalled, since her paralytic stroke the evening before, in the\r\nlarger and grander bed; while Jane Wilson had taken her short broken\r\nrest on the little pallet.\r\n\r\nMargaret came forwards to meet her friend, whom she half expected,\r\nand whose step she knew.  Mrs. Davenport returned to her washing.\r\n\r\nThe two girls did not speak; the presence of Alice awed them into\r\nsilence.  There she lay with the rosy colour, absent from her face\r\nsince the days of childhood, flushed once more into it by her\r\nsickness nigh unto death.  She lay on the affected side, and with\r\nher other arm she was constantly sawing the air, not exactly in a\r\nrestless manner, but in a monotonous, incessant way, very trying to\r\na watcher.  She was talking away, too, almost as constantly, in a\r\nlow indistinct tone.  But her face, her profiled countenance, looked\r\ncalm and smiling, even interested by the ideas that were passing\r\nthrough her clouded mind.\r\n\r\n"Listen!" said Margaret, as she stooped her head down to catch the\r\nmuttered words more distinctly.\r\n\r\n"What will mother say?  The bees are turning homeward for th\' last\r\ntime, and we\'ve a terrible long bit to go yet.  See! here\'s a\r\nlinnet\'s nest in this gorse-bush.  Th\' hen bird is on it.  Look at\r\nher bright eyes, she won\'t stir.  Ay! we mun hurry home.  Won\'t\r\nmother be pleased with the bonny lot of heather we\'ve got!  Make\r\nhaste, Sally, maybe we shall have cockles for supper.  I saw th\'\r\ncockleman\'s donkey turn up our way fra\' Arnside."\r\n\r\nMargaret touched Mary\'s hand, and the pressure in return told her\r\nthat they understood each other; that they knew how in this illness\r\nto the old, world-weary woman, God had sent her a veiled blessing:\r\nshe was once more in the scenes of her childhood, unchanged and\r\nbright as in those long departed days; once more with the sister of\r\nher youth, the playmate of fifty years ago, who had for nearly as\r\nmany years slept in a grassy grave in the little churchyard beyond\r\nBurton.\r\n\r\nAlice\'s face changed; she looked sorrowful, almost penitent.\r\n\r\n"O Sally!  I wish we\'d told her.  She thinks we were in church all\r\nmorning, and we\'ve gone on deceiving her.  If we\'d told her at first\r\nhow it was--how sweet th\' hawthorn smelt through the open church\r\ndoor, and how we were on th\' last bench in the aisle, and how it\r\nwere the first butterfly we\'d seen this spring, and how it flew into\r\nth\' very church itself; oh! mother is so gentle, I wish we\'d told\r\nher.  I\'ll go to her next time she comes in sight, and say, \'Mother,\r\nwe were naughty last Sabbath.\'"\r\n\r\nShe stopped, and a few tears came stealing down the old withered\r\ncheek, at the thought of the temptation and deceit of her childhood.\r\nSurely many sins could not have darkened that innocent child-like\r\nspirit since.  Mary found a red-spotted pocket-handkerchief, and put\r\nit into the hand which sought about for something to wipe away the\r\ntrickling tears.  She took it with a gentle murmur.\r\n\r\n"Thank you, mother."\r\n\r\nMary pulled Margaret away from the bed.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you think she\'s happy, Margaret?"\r\n\r\n"Ay! that I do, bless her.  She feels no pain, and knows nought of\r\nher present state.  Oh! that I could see, Mary!  I try and be\r\npatient with her afore me, but I\'d give aught I have to see her, and\r\nsee what she wants.  I am so useless!  I mean to stay here as long\r\nas Jane Wilson is alone; and I would fain be here all to-night,\r\nbut"--\r\n\r\n"I\'ll come," said Mary decidedly.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Davenport said she\'d come again, but she\'s hardworked all\r\nday"--\r\n\r\n"I\'ll come," repeated Mary.\r\n\r\n"Do!" said Margaret, "and I\'ll be here till you come.  Maybe, Jem\r\nand you could take th\' night between you, and Jane Wilson might get\r\na bit of sound sleep in his bed; for she were up and down the better\r\npart of last night, and just when she were in a sound sleep this\r\nmorning, between two and three, Jem came home, and th\' sound o\' his\r\nvoice roused her in a minute."\r\n\r\n"Where had he been till that time o\' night?" asked Mary.\r\n\r\n"Nay! it were none of my business; and, indeed, I never saw him till\r\nhe came in here to see Alice.  He were in again this morning, and\r\nseemed sadly downcast.  But you\'ll, maybe, manage to comfort him\r\nto-night, Mary," said Margaret, smiling, while a ray of hope\r\nglimmered in Mary\'s heart, and she almost felt glad, for an instant,\r\nof the occasion which would at last bring them together.  Oh! happy\r\nnight! when would it come?  Many hours had yet to pass.\r\n\r\nThen she saw Alice, and repented, with a bitter self-reproach.  But\r\nshe could not help having gladness in the depths of her heart, blame\r\nherself as she would.  So she tried not to think, as she hurried\r\nalong to Miss Simmonds\', with a dancing step of lightness.\r\n\r\nShe was late--that she knew she should be.  Miss Simmonds was vexed\r\nand cross.  That also she had anticipated, and had intended to\r\nsmooth her raven down by extraordinary diligence and attention.  But\r\nthere was something about the girls she did not understand--had not\r\nanticipated.  They stopped talking when she came in; or rather, I\r\nshould say, stopped listening, for Sally Leadbitter was the talker\r\nto whom they were hearkening with deepest attention.  At first they\r\neyed Mary, as if she had acquired some new interest to them since\r\nthe day before.  Then they began to whisper; and, absorbed as Mary\r\nhad been in her own thoughts, she could not help becoming aware that\r\nit was of her they spoke.\r\n\r\nAt last Sally Leadbitter asked Mary if she had heard the news?\r\n\r\n"No!  What news?" answered she.\r\n\r\nThe girls looked at each other with gloomy mystery.  Sally went on.\r\n\r\n"Have you not heard that young Mr. Carson was murdered last night?"\r\n\r\nMary\'s lips could not utter a negative, but no one who looked at her\r\npale and terror-stricken face could have doubted that she had not\r\nheard before of the fearful occurrence.\r\n\r\nOh, it is terrible, that sudden information, that one you have known\r\nhas met with a bloody death!  You seem to shrink from the world\r\nwhere such deeds can be committed, and to grow sick with the idea of\r\nthe violent and wicked men of earth.  Much as Mary had learned to\r\ndread him lately, now he was dead (and dead in such a manner) her\r\nfeeling was that of oppressive sorrow for him.\r\n\r\nThe room went round and round, and she felt as though she should\r\nfaint; but Miss Simmonds came in, bringing a waft of fresher air as\r\nshe opened the door, to refresh the body, and the certainty of a\r\nscolding for inattention to brace the sinking mind.  She, too, was\r\nfull of the morning\'s news.\r\n\r\n"Have you heard any more of this horrid affair, Miss Barton?" asked\r\nshe, as she settled to her work.\r\n\r\nMary tried to speak; at first she could not, and when she succeeded\r\nin uttering a sentence, it seemed as though it were not her own\r\nvoice that spoke.\r\n\r\n"No, ma\'am, I never heard of it till this minute."\r\n\r\n"Dear! that\'s strange, for every one is up about it.  I hope the\r\nmurderer will be found out, that I do.  Such a handsome young man to\r\nbe killed as he was.  I hope the wretch that did it may be hanged as\r\nhigh as Haman."\r\n\r\nOne of the girls reminded them that the assizes came on next week.\r\n\r\n"Ay," replied Miss Simmonds, "and the milkman told me they will\r\ncatch the wretch, and have him tried and hung in less than a week.\r\nServe him right, whoever he is.  Such a handsome young man as he\r\nwas."\r\n\r\nThen each began to communicate to Miss Simmonds the various reports\r\nthey had heard.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she burst out--\r\n\r\n"Miss Barton! as I live, dropping tears on that new silk gown of\r\nMrs. Hawkes\'!  Don\'t you know they will stain, and make it shabby\r\nfor ever?  Crying like a baby, because a handsome young man meets\r\nwith an untimely end.  For shame of yourself, miss!  Mind your\r\ncharacter and your work, if you please.  Or if you must cry" (seeing\r\nher scolding rather increased the flow of Mary\'s tears, than\r\notherwise), "take this print to cry over.  That won\'t be marked like\r\nthis beautiful silk," rubbing it, as if she loved it, with a clean\r\npocket-handkerchief, in order to soften the edges of the hard round\r\ndrops.\r\n\r\nMary took the print, and, naturally enough, having had leave given\r\nher to cry over it, rather checked the inclination to weep.\r\n\r\nEverybody was full of the one subject.  The girl sent out to match\r\nsilk, came back with the account gathered at the shop, of the\r\ncoroner\'s inquest then sitting; the ladies who called to speak about\r\ngowns first began about the murder, and mingled details of that,\r\nwith directions for their dresses.  Mary felt as though the haunting\r\nhorror were a nightmare, a fearful dream, from which awakening would\r\nrelieve her.  The picture of the murdered body, far more ghastly\r\nthan the reality, seemed to swim in the air before her eyes.  Sally\r\nLeadbitter looked and spoke of her, almost accusingly, and made no\r\nsecret now of Mary\'s conduct, more blamable to her fellow-workwomen\r\nfor its latter changeableness, than for its former giddy flirting.\r\n\r\n"Poor young gentleman," said one, as Sally recounted Mary\'s last\r\ninterview with Mr. Carson.\r\n\r\n"What a shame!" exclaimed another, looking indignantly at Mary.\r\n\r\n"That\'s what I call regular jilting," said a third.  "And he lying\r\ncold and bloody in his coffin now!"\r\n\r\nMary was more thankful than she could express, when Miss Simmonds\r\nreturned, to put a stop to Sally\'s communications, and to check the\r\nremarks of the girls.\r\n\r\nShe longed for the peace of Alice\'s sick-room.  No more thinking\r\nwith infinite delight of her anticipated meeting with Jem; she felt\r\ntoo much shocked for that now; but longing for peace and kindness,\r\nfor the images of rest and beauty, and sinless times long ago, which\r\nthe poor old woman\'s rambling presented, she wished to be as near\r\ndeath as Alice; and to have struggled through this world, whose\r\nsufferings she had early learnt, and whose crimes now seemed\r\npressing close upon her.  Old texts from the Bible, that her mother\r\nused to read (or rather spell out) aloud in the days of childhood,\r\ncame up to her memory.  "Where the wicked cease from troubling, and\r\nthe weary are at rest."  "And God shall wipe away all tears from\r\ntheir eyes," etc.  And it was to that world Alice was hastening!\r\nOh! that she were Alice!\r\n\r\nI must return to the Wilsons\' house, which was far from being the\r\nabode of peace that Mary was picturing it to herself.  You remember\r\nthe reward Mr. Carson offered for the apprehension of the murderer\r\nof his son?  It was in itself a temptation, and to aid its efficacy\r\ncame the natural sympathy for the aged parents mourning for their\r\nchild, for the young man cut off in the flower of his days; and\r\nbesides this, there is always a pleasure in unravelling a mystery,\r\nin catching at the gossamer clue which will guide to certainty.\r\nThis feeling, I am sure, gives much impetus to the police.  Their\r\nsenses are ever and always on the qui-vive, and they enjoy the\r\ncollecting and collating evidence, and the life of adventure they\r\nexperience: a continual unwinding of Jack Sheppard romances,\r\nalways interesting to the vulgar and uneducated mind, to which the\r\noutward signs and tokens of crime are ever exciting.\r\n\r\nThere was no lack of clue or evidence at the coroner\'s inquest that\r\nmorning.  The shot, the finding of the body, the subsequent\r\ndiscovery of the gun, were rapidly deposed to; and then the\r\npoliceman who had interrupted the quarrel between Jem Wilson and the\r\nmurdered young man was brought forward, and gave his evidence,\r\nclear, simple, and straightforward.  The coroner had no hesitation,\r\nthe jury had none, but the verdict was cautiously worded.  "Wilful\r\nmurder against some person unknown."\r\n\r\nThis very cautiousness, when he deemed the thing so sure as to\r\nrequire no caution, irritated Mr. Carson.  It did not soothe him\r\nthat the superintendent called the verdict a mere form,--exhibited a\r\nwarrant empowering him to seize the body of Jem Wilson committed on\r\nsuspicion,--declared his intention of employing a well-known officer\r\nin the Detective Service to ascertain the ownership of the gun, and\r\nto collect other evidence, especially as regarded the young woman,\r\nabout whom the policeman deposed that the quarrel had taken place;\r\nMr. Carson was still excited and irritable; restless in body and\r\nmind.  He made every preparation for the accusation of Jem the\r\nfollowing morning before the magistrates: he engaged attorneys\r\nskilled in criminal practice to watch the case and prepare briefs;\r\nhe wrote to celebrated barristers coming the Northern Circuit, to\r\nbespeak their services.  A speedy conviction, a speedy execution,\r\nseemed to be the only things that would satisfy his craving thirst\r\nfor blood.  He would have fain been policeman, magistrate, accusing\r\nspeaker, all; but most of all, the judge, rising with full sentence\r\nof death on his lips.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon, as Jane Wilson had begun to feel the effect of a\r\nnight\'s disturbed rest, evinced in frequent droppings off to sleep,\r\nwhile she sat by her sister-in-law\'s bedside, lulled by the\r\nincessant crooning of the invalid\'s feeble voice, she was startled\r\nby a man speaking in the house-place below, who, wearied of knocking\r\nat the door, without obtaining any answer, had entered and was\r\ncalling lustily for--\r\n\r\n"Missis! missis!"\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs. Wilson caught a glimpse of the intruder through the\r\nstair-rails, she at once saw he was a stranger, a working-man, it\r\nmight be a fellow-labourer with her son, for his dress was grimy\r\nenough for the supposition.  He held a gun in his hand.\r\n\r\n"May I make bold to ask if this gun belongs to your son?"\r\n\r\nShe first looked at the man, and then, weary and half asleep, not\r\nseeing any reason for refusing to answer the inquiry, she moved\r\nforward to examine it, talking while she looked for certain\r\nold-fashioned ornaments on the stock.  "It looks like his; ay, it is\r\nhis, sure enough.  I could speak to it anywhere by these marks.  You\r\nsee it were his grandfather\'s as were gamekeeper to some one up in\r\nth\' north; and they don\'t make guns so smart nowadays.  But, how\r\ncomed you by it?  He sets great store on it.  Is he bound for th\'\r\nshooting-gallery?  He is not, for sure, now his aunt is so ill, and\r\nme left all alone"; and the immediate cause of her anxiety being\r\nthus recalled to her mind, she entered on a long story of Alice\'s\r\nillness, interspersed with recollections of her husband\'s and her\r\nchildren\'s deaths.\r\n\r\nThe disguised policeman listened for a minute or two, to glean any\r\nfurther information he could; and then, saying he was in a hurry, he\r\nturned to go away.  She followed him to the door, still telling him\r\nher troubles, and was never struck, until it was too late to ask the\r\nreason, with the unaccountableness of his conduct, in carrying the\r\ngun away with him.  Then, as she heavily climbed the stairs, she put\r\naway the wonder and the thought about his conduct, by determining to\r\nbelieve he was some workman with whom her son had made some\r\narrangement about shooting at the gallery; or mending the old\r\nweapon; or something or other.  She had enough to fret her, without\r\nmoidering herself about old guns.  Jem had given it to him to bring\r\nit to her; so it was safe enough; or, if it was not, why she should\r\nbe glad never to set eyes on it again, for she could not abide\r\nfirearms, they were so apt to shoot people.\r\n\r\nSo, comforting herself for the want of thought in not making further\r\ninquiry, she fell off into another dose, feverish, dream-haunted,\r\nand unrefreshing.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the policeman walked off with his prize, with an odd\r\nmixture of feelings; a little contempt, a little disappointment, and\r\na good deal of pity.  The contempt and the disappointment were\r\ncaused by the widow\'s easy admission of the gun being her son\'s\r\nproperty, and her manner of identifying it by the ornaments.  He\r\nliked an attempt to baffle him; he was accustomed to it; it gave\r\nsome exercise to his wits and his shrewdness.  There would be no fun\r\nin fox-hunting, if Reynard yielded himself up without any effort to\r\nescape.  Then, again, his mother\'s milk was yet in him, policeman,\r\nofficer of the Detective Service though he was; and he felt sorry\r\nfor the old woman, whose "softness" had given such material\r\nassistance in identifying her son as the murderer.  However, he\r\nconveyed the gun, and the intelligence he had gained, to the\r\nsuperintendent; and the result was, that, in a short time\r\nafterwards, three policemen went to the works at which Jem was\r\nforeman, and announced their errand to the astonished overseer, who\r\ndirected them to the part of the foundry where Jem was then\r\nsuperintending a casting.\r\n\r\nDark, black were the walls, the ground, the faces around them, as\r\nthey crossed the yard.  But, in the furnace-house, a deep and lurid\r\nred glared over all; the furnace roared with mighty flame.  The men,\r\nlike demons, in their fire-and-soot colouring, stood swart around,\r\nawaiting the moment when the tons of solid iron should have melted\r\ndown into fiery liquid, fit to be poured, with still, heavy sound,\r\ninto the delicate moulding of fine black sand, prepared to receive\r\nit.  The heat was intense, and the red glare grew every instant more\r\nfierce; the policemen stood awed with the novel sight.  Then, black\r\nfigures, holding strange-shaped bucket-shovels, came athwart the\r\ndeep-red furnace light, and clear and brilliant flowed forth the\r\niron into the appropriate mould.  The buzz of voices rose again;\r\nthere was time to speak, and gasp, and wipe the brows; and then one\r\nby one, the men dispersed to some other branch of their employment.\r\n\r\nNo. B72 pointed out Jem as the man he had seen engaged in a scuffle\r\nwith Mr. Carson, and then the other two stepped forward and arrested\r\nhim, stating of what he was accused, and the grounds of the\r\naccusation.  He offered no resistance, though he seemed surprised;\r\nbut calling a fellow-workman to him, he briefly requested him to\r\ntell his mother he had got into trouble, and could not return home\r\nat present.  He did not wish her to hear more at first.\r\n\r\nSo Mrs. Wilson\'s sleep was next interrupted in almost an exactly\r\nsimilar way to the last, like a recurring nightmare.\r\n\r\n"Missis! missis!" some one called out from below.\r\n\r\nAgain it was a workman, but this time a blacker-looking one than\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n"What don ye want?" said she peevishly.\r\n\r\n"Only nothing but"--stammered the man, a kind-hearted matter-of-fact\r\nperson, with no invention, but a great deal of sympathy.\r\n\r\n"Well, speak out, can\'t ye, and ha\' done with it?"\r\n\r\n"Jem\'s in trouble," said he, repeating Jem\'s very words, as he could\r\nthink of no others.\r\n\r\n"Trouble?" said the mother, in a high-pitched voice of distress.\r\n"Trouble!  God help me, trouble will never end, I think.  What d\'ye\r\nmean by trouble?  Speak out, man, can\'t ye?  Is he ill?  My boy!\r\ntell me, is he ill?" in a hurried voice of terror.\r\n\r\n"Na, na, that\'s not it.  He\'s well enough.  All he bade me say was,\r\n\'Tell mother I\'m in trouble, and can\'t come home tonight.\'"\r\n\r\n"Not come home to-night!  And what am I to do with Alice?  I can\'t\r\ngo on, wearing my life out wi\' watching.  He might come and help\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"I tell you he can\'t," said the man.\r\n\r\n"Can\'t, and he is well, you say?  Stuff!  It\'s just that he\'s getten\r\nlike other young men, and wants to go a-larking.  But I\'ll give it\r\nhim when he comes back."\r\n\r\nThe man turned to go; he durst not trust himself to speak in Jem\'s\r\njustification.  But she would not let him off.\r\n\r\nShe stood between him and the door, as she said--\r\n\r\n"Yo shall not go till yo\'ve told me what he\'s after.  I can see\r\nplain enough you know, and I\'ll know too, before I\'ve done."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll know soon enough, missis!"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll know now, I tell ye.  What\'s up that he can\'t come home and\r\nhelp me nurse?  Me, as never got a wink o\' sleep last night wi\'\r\nwatching."\r\n\r\n"Well, if you will have it out," said the poor badgered man, "the\r\npolice have got hold on him."\r\n\r\n"On my Jem!" said the enraged mother.  "You\'re a downright liar, and\r\nthat\'s what you are.  My Jem, as never did harm to any one in his\r\nlife.  You\'re a liar, that\'s what you are."\r\n\r\n"He\'s done harm enough now," said the man, angry in his turn, "for\r\nthere\'s good evidence he murdered young Carson, as was shot last\r\nnight."\r\n\r\nShe staggered forward to strike the man for telling the terrible\r\ntruth; but the weakness of old age, of motherly agony, overcame her,\r\nand she sank down on a chair, and covered her face.  He could not\r\nleave her.\r\n\r\nWhen next she spoke, it was in an imploring, feeble, child-like\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n"O master, say you\'re only joking.  I ax your pardon if I have vexed\r\nye, but please say you\'re only joking.  You don\'t know what Jem is\r\nto me."\r\n\r\nShe looked humbly, anxiously up to him.\r\n\r\n"I wish I were only joking, missis; but it\'s true as I say.  They\'ve\r\ntaken him up on charge of murder.  It were his gun as were found\r\nnear th\' place; and one o\' the police heard him quarrelling with Mr.\r\nCarson a few days back, about a girl."\r\n\r\n"About a girl!" broke in the mother, once more indignant, though too\r\nfeeble to show it as before.  "My Jem was as steady as"--she\r\nhesitated for a comparison wherewith to finish, and then repeated,\r\n"as steady as Lucifer, and he were an angel, you know.  My Jem was\r\nnot one to quarrel about a girl."\r\n\r\n"Ay, but it was that, though.  They\'d got her name quite pat.  The\r\nman had heard all they said.  Mary Barton was her name, whoever she\r\nmay be."\r\n\r\n"Mary Barton! the dirty hussy! to bring my Jem into trouble of this\r\nkind.  I\'ll give it her well when I see her: that I will.  Oh! my\r\npoor Jem!" rocking herself to and fro.  "And what about the gun?\r\nWhat did ye say about that?"\r\n\r\n"His gun were found on th\' spot where the murder were done."\r\n\r\n"That\'s a lie for one, then.  A man has got the gun now, safe and\r\nsound.  I saw it not an hour ago."\r\n\r\nThe man shook his head.\r\n\r\n"Yes, he has indeed.  A friend o\' Jem\'s, as he\'d lent it to."\r\n\r\n"Did you know the chap?" asked the man, who was really anxious for\r\nJem\'s exculpation, and caught a gleam of hope from her last speech.\r\n\r\n"No! I can\'t say as I did.  But he were put on as a workman."\r\n\r\n"It\'s maybe only one of them policemen, disguised."\r\n\r\n"Nay; they\'d never go for to do that, and trick me into telling on\r\nmy own son.  It would be like seething a kid in its mother\'s milk;\r\nand that th\' Bible forbids."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," replied the man.\r\n\r\nSoon afterwards he went away, feeling unable to comfort, yet\r\ndistressed at the sight of sorrow; she would fain have detained him,\r\nbut go he would.  And she was alone.\r\n\r\nShe never for an instant believed Jem guilty: she would have\r\ndoubted if the sun were fire, first: but sorrow, desolation, and\r\nat times anger, took possession of her mind.  She told the\r\nunconscious Alice, hoping to rouse her to sympathy; and then was\r\ndisappointed, because, still smiling and calm, she murmured of her\r\nmother, and the happy days of infancy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX.   MARY\'S DREAM--AND THE AWAKENING.\r\n\r\n     "I saw where stark and cold he lay,\r\n        Beneath the gallows-tree,\r\n      And every one did point and say,\r\n        \'\'Twas there he died for thee!\'\r\n\r\n               *     *     *\r\n\r\n     "Oh! weeping heart!  Oh! bleeding heart!\r\n        What boots thy pity now?\r\n      Bid from his eyes that shade depart,\r\n        That death-damp from his brow!"\r\n                            --"THE BIRTLE TRAGEDY."\r\n\r\nSo there was no more peace in the house of sickness except to Alice,\r\nthe dying Alice.\r\n\r\nBut Mary knew nothing of the afternoon\'s occurrences; and gladly did\r\nshe breathe in the fresh air, as she left Miss Simmonds\' house, to\r\nhasten to the Wilsons\'.  The very change, from the indoor to the\r\noutdoor atmosphere, seemed to alter the current of her thoughts.\r\nShe thought less of the dreadful subject which had so haunted her\r\nall day; she cared less for the upbraiding speeches of her\r\nfellow-workwomen; the old association of comfort and sympathy\r\nreceived from Alice gave her the idea that, even now, her bodily\r\npresence would soothe and compose those who were in trouble,\r\nchanged, unconscious, and absent though her spirit might be.\r\n\r\nThen, again, she reproached herself a little for the feeling of\r\npleasure she experienced, in thinking that he whom she dreaded could\r\nnever more beset her path; in the security with which she could pass\r\neach street corner--each shop, where he used to lie in ambush.  Oh!\r\nbeating heart! was there no other little thought of joy lurking\r\nwithin, to gladden the very air without!  Was she not going to meet,\r\nto see, to hear Jem; and could they fail at last to understand each\r\nother\'s loving hearts!\r\n\r\nShe softly lifted the latch, with the privilege of friendship.  HE\r\nwas not there, but his mother was standing by the fire, stirring\r\nsome little mess or other.  Never mind! he would come soon: and\r\nwith an unmixed desire to do her graceful duty to all belonging to\r\nhim, she stepped lightly forwards, unheard by the old lady, who was\r\npartly occupied by the simmering, bubbling sound of her bit of\r\ncookery; but more with her own sad thoughts, and wailing, half-\r\nuttered murmurings.\r\n\r\nMary took off bonnet and shawl with speed, and advancing, made Mrs.\r\nWilson conscious of her presence, by saying--\r\n\r\n"Let me do that for you.  I\'m sure you mun be tired."\r\n\r\nMrs. Wilson slowly turned round, and her eyes gleamed like those of\r\na pent-up wild beast, as she recognised her visitor.\r\n\r\n"And is it thee that dares set foot in this house, after what has\r\ncome to pass?  Is it not enough to have robbed me of my boy with thy\r\narts and thy profligacy, but thou must come here to crow over\r\nme--me--his mother?  Dost thou know where he is, thou bad hussy,\r\nwith thy great blue eyes and yellow hair, to lead men on to ruin?\r\nOut upon thee with thy angel\'s face, thou whited sepulchre!  Dost\r\nthou know where Jem is, all through thee?"\r\n\r\n"No!" quivered out poor Mary, scarcely conscious that she spoke, so\r\ndaunted, so terrified was she by the indignant mother\'s greeting.\r\n\r\n"He\'s lying in th\' New Bailey," slowly and distinctly spoke the\r\nmother, watching the effect of her words, as if believing in their\r\ninfinite power to pain.  "There he lies, waiting to take his trial\r\nfor murdering young Mr. Carson."\r\n\r\nThere was no answer; but such a blanched face, such wild, distended\r\neyes, such trembling limbs, instinctively seeking support!\r\n\r\n"Did you know Mr. Carson as now lies dead?" continued the merciless\r\nwoman.  "Folk say you did, and knew him but too well.  And that for\r\nthe sake of such as you, my precious child shot yon chap.  But he\r\ndid not.  I know he did not.  They may hang him, but his mother will\r\nspeak to his innocence with her last dying breath."\r\n\r\nShe stopped more from exhaustion than want of words.  Mary spoke,\r\nbut in so changed and choked a voice that the old woman almost\r\nstarted.  It seemed as if some third person must be in the room, the\r\nvoice was so hoarse and strange.\r\n\r\n"Please say it again.  I don\'t quite understand you.  What has Jem\r\ndone?  Please to tell me."\r\n\r\n"I never said he had done it.  I said, and I\'ll swear, that he never\r\ndid do it.  I don\'t care who heard \'em quarrel, or if it is his gun\r\nas were found near the body.  It\'s not my own Jem as would go for to\r\nkill any man, choose how a girl had jilted him.  My own good Jem, as\r\nwas a blessing sent upon the house where he was born."  Tears came\r\ninto the mother\'s burning eyes as her heart recurred to the days\r\nwhen she had rocked the cradle of her "first-born"; and then,\r\nrapidly passing over events, till the full consciousness of his\r\npresent situation came upon her, and perhaps annoyed at having shown\r\nany softness of character in the presence of the Delilah who had\r\nlured him to his danger, she spoke again, and in a sharp tone.\r\n\r\n"I told him, and told him to leave off thinking on thee; but he\r\nwouldn\'t be led by me.  Thee! wench! thou wert not good enough to\r\nwipe the dust off his feet.  A vile, flirting quean as thou art.\r\nIt\'s well thy mother does not know (poor body) what a good-\r\nfor-nothing thou art."\r\n\r\n"Mother! O mother!" said Mary, as if appealing to the merciful dead.\r\n"But I was not good enough for him!  I know I was not," added she,\r\nin a voice of touching humility.\r\n\r\nFor through her heart went tolling the ominous, prophetic words he\r\nhad used when he had last spoken to her--\r\n\r\n"Mary! you\'ll maybe hear of me as a drunkard, and maybe as a thief,\r\nand maybe as a murderer.  Remember! when all are speaking ill of me,\r\nyo will have no right to blame me, for it\'s your cruelty that will\r\nhave made me what I feel I shall become."\r\n\r\nAnd she did not blame him, though she doubted not his guilt; she\r\nfelt how madly she might act if once jealous of him, and how much\r\ncause had she not given him for jealousy, miserable guilty wretch\r\nthat she was!  Speak on, desolate mother.  Abuse her as you will.\r\nHer broken spirit feels to have merited all.\r\n\r\nBut her last humble, self-abased words had touched Mrs. Wilson\'s\r\nheart, sore as it was; and she looked at the snow-pale girl with\r\nthose piteous eyes, so hopeless of comfort, and she relented in\r\nspite of herself.\r\n\r\n"Thou seest what comes of light conduct, Mary!  It\'s thy doing that\r\nsuspicion has lighted on him, who is as innocent as the babe unborn.\r\nThou\'lt have much to answer for if he\'s hung.  Thou\'lt have my death\r\ntoo at thy door!"\r\n\r\nHarsh as these words seem, she spoke them in a milder tone of voice\r\nthan she had yet used.  But the idea of Jem on the gallows, Jem\r\ndead, took possession of Mary, and she covered her eyes with her wan\r\nhands, as if indeed to shut out the fearful sight.\r\n\r\nShe murmured some words, which, though spoken low, as if choked up\r\nfrom the depths of agony, Jane Wilson caught.  "My heart is\r\nbreaking," said she feebly.  "My heart is breaking."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense!" said Mrs. Wilson.  "Don\'t talk in that silly way.  My\r\nheart has a better right to break than yours, and yet I hold up, you\r\nsee.  But, oh dear! oh dear!" with a sudden revulsion of feeling, as\r\nthe reality of the danger in which her son was placed pressed upon\r\nher.  "What am I saying?  How could I hold up if thou wert gone,\r\nJem?  Though I\'m as sure as I stand here of thy innocence, if they\r\nhang thee, my lad, I will lie down and die!"\r\n\r\nShe wept aloud with bitter consciousness of the fearful chance\r\nawaiting her child.  She cried more passionately still.\r\n\r\nMary roused herself up.\r\n\r\n"Oh, let me stay with you, at any rate, till we know the end.\r\nDearest Mrs. Wilson, mayn\'t I stay?"\r\n\r\nThe more obstinately and upbraidingly Mrs. Wilson refused, the more\r\nMary pleaded, with ever the same soft entreating cry, "Let me stay\r\nwith you."  Her stunned soul seem to bound its wishes, for the hour\r\nat least, to remaining with one who loved and sorrowed for the same\r\nhuman being that she did.\r\n\r\nBut no.  Mrs. Wilson was inflexible.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve, maybe, been a bit hard on you, Mary, I\'ll own that.  But I\r\ncannot abide you yet with me.  I cannot but remember it\'s your\r\ngiddiness as has wrought this woe.  I\'ll stay with Alice, and\r\nperhaps Mrs. Davenport may come help a bit.  I cannot put up with\r\nyou about me.  Good-night.  To-morrow I may look on you different,\r\nmaybe.  Good-night."\r\n\r\nAnd Mary turned out of the house, which had been HIS home, where HE\r\nwas loved, and mourned for, into the busy, desolate, crowded street,\r\nwhere they were crying halfpenny broadsides, giving an account of\r\nthe bloody murder, the coroner\'s inquest, and a raw-head-and-bloody-\r\nbones picture of the suspected murderer, James Wilson.\r\n\r\nBut Mary heard not; she heeded not.  She staggered on like one in a\r\ndream.  With hung head and tottering steps, she instinctively chose\r\nthe shortest cut to that home which was to her, in her present state\r\nof mind, only the hiding-place of four walls, where she might vent\r\nher agony, unseen and unnoticed by the keen unkind world without,\r\nbut where no welcome, no love, no sympathising tears awaited her.\r\n\r\nAs she neared that home, within two minutes\' walk of it, her\r\nimpetuous course was arrested by a light touch on her arm, and\r\nturning hastily she saw a little Italian boy with his humble\r\nshow-box, a white mouse, or some such thing.  The setting sun cast\r\nits red glow on his face, otherwise the olive complexion would have\r\nbeen very pale; and the glittering tear-drops hung on the\r\nlong-curled eye-lashes.  With his soft voice and pleading looks, he\r\nuttered, in his pretty broken English, the words--\r\n\r\n"Hungry! so hungry."\r\n\r\nAnd as if to aid by gesture the effect of the solitary word, he\r\npointed to his mouth, with its white quivering lips.\r\n\r\nMary answered him impatiently, "O lad, hunger is nothing--nothing!"\r\n\r\nAnd she rapidly passed on.  But her heart upbraided her the next\r\nminute with her unrelenting speech, and she hastily entered her door\r\nand seized the scanty remnant of food which the cupboard contained,\r\nand she retraced her steps to the place where the little hopeless\r\nstranger had sunk down by his mute companion in loneliness and\r\nstarvation, and was raining down tears as he spoke in some foreign\r\ntongue, with low cries for the far distant "Mamma mia!"\r\n\r\nWith the elasticity of heart belonging to childhood he sprang up as\r\nhe saw the food the girl brought; she whose face, lovely in its woe,\r\nhad tempted him first to address her; and, with the graceful\r\ncourtesy of his country, he looked up and smiled while he kissed her\r\nhand, and then poured forth his thanks, and shared her bounty with\r\nhis little pet companion.  She stood an instant, diverted from the\r\nthought of her own grief by the sight of his infantine gladness; and\r\nthen bending down and kissing his smooth forehead, she left him, and\r\nsought to be alone with her agony once more.\r\n\r\nShe re-entered the house, locked the door, and tore off her bonnet,\r\nas if greedy of every moment which took her from the full indulgence\r\nof painful, despairing thought.\r\n\r\nThen she threw herself on the ground, yes, on the hard flags she\r\nthrew her soft limbs down; and the comb fell out of her hair, and\r\nthose bright tresses swept the dusty floor, while she pillowed and\r\nhid her face on her arms, and burst forth into loud, suffocating\r\nsobs.\r\n\r\nO earth! thou didst seem but a dreary dwelling-place for thy poor\r\nchild that night.  None to comfort, none to pity!  And self-reproach\r\ngnawing at her heart.\r\n\r\nOh, why did she ever listen to the tempter?  Why did she ever give\r\near to her own suggestions, and cravings after wealth and grandeur?\r\nWhy had she thought it a fine thing to have a rich lover?\r\n\r\nShe--she had deserved it all: but he was the victim,--he, the\r\nbeloved.  She could not conjecture, she could not even pause to\r\nthink who had revealed, or how he had discovered her acquaintance\r\nwith Harry Carson.  It was but too clear, some way or another, he\r\nhad learnt all; and what would he think of her?  No hope of his\r\nlove,--oh, that she would give up, and be content: it was his\r\nlife, his precious life, that was threatened!  Then she tried to\r\nrecall the particulars, which, when Mrs. Wilson had given them, had\r\nfallen but upon a deafened ear,--something about a gun, a quarrel,\r\nwhich she could not remember clearly.  Oh, how terrible to think of\r\nhis crime, his blood-guiltiness; he who had hitherto been so good,\r\nso noble, and now an assassin!  And then she shrank from him in\r\nthought; and then, with bitter remorse, clung more closely to his\r\nimage with passionate self-upbraiding.  Was it not she who had led\r\nhim to the pit into which he had fallen?  Was she to blame him?  She\r\nto judge him?  Who could tell how maddened he might have been by\r\njealousy; how one moment\'s uncontrollable passion might have led him\r\nto become a murderer!  And she had blamed him in her heart after his\r\nlast deprecating, imploring, prophetic speech!\r\n\r\nThen she burst out crying afresh; and when weary of crying, fell to\r\nthinking again.  The gallows!  The gallows!  Black it stood against\r\nthe burning light which dazzled her shut eyes, press on them as she\r\nwould.  Oh! she was going mad; and for awhile she lay outwardly\r\nstill, but with the pulses careering through her head with wild\r\nvehemence.\r\n\r\nAnd then came a strange forgetfulness of the present, in thought of\r\nthe long-past times;--of those days when she hid her face on her\r\nmother\'s pitying, loving bosom, and heard tender words of comfort,\r\nbe her grief or her error what it might;--of those days when she had\r\nfelt as if her mother\'s love was too mighty not to last for\r\never;--of those days when hunger had been to her (as to the little\r\nstranger she had that evening relieved) something to be thought\r\nabout, and mourned over;--when Jem and she had played together; he,\r\nwith the condescension of an older child, and she, with unconscious\r\nearnestness, believing that he was as much gratified with important\r\ntrifles as she was;--when her father was a cheery-hearted man, rich\r\nin the love of his wife, and the companionship of his friend;--when\r\n(for it still worked round to that), when mother was alive, and HE\r\nwas not a murderer.\r\n\r\nAnd then Heaven blessed her unaware, and she sank from remembering,\r\nto wandering, unconnected thought, and thence to sleep.  Yes! it was\r\nsleep, though in that strange posture, on that hard cold bed; and\r\nshe dreamt of the happy times of long ago, and her mother came to\r\nher, and kissed her as she lay, and once more the dead were alive\r\nagain in that happy world of dreams.  All was restored to the\r\ngladness of childhood, even to the little kitten which had been her\r\nplaymate and bosom friend then, and which had been long forgotten in\r\nher waking hours.  All the loved ones were there!\r\n\r\nShe suddenly wakened!  Clear and wide awake!  Some noise had\r\nstartled her from sleep.  She sat up, and put her hair (still wet\r\nwith tears) back from her flushed cheeks, and listened.  At first\r\nshe could only hear her beating heart.  All was still without, for\r\nit was after midnight, such hours of agony had passed away; but the\r\nmoon shone clearly in at the unshuttered window, making the room\r\nalmost as light as day, in its cold ghastly radiance.  There was a\r\nlow knock at the door!  A strange feeling crept over Mary\'s heart,\r\nas if something spiritual were near; as if the dead, so lately\r\npresent in her dreams, were yet gliding and hovering round her, with\r\ntheir dim, dread forms.  And yet, why dread?  Had they not loved\r\nher?--and who loved her now?  Was she not lonely enough to welcome\r\nthe spirits of the dead, who had loved her while here?  If her\r\nmother had conscious being, her love for her child endured.  So she\r\nquieted her fears, and listened--listened still.\r\n\r\n"Mary!  Mary! open the door!" as a little movement on her part\r\nseemed to tell the being outside of her wakeful, watchful state.\r\nThey were the accents of her mother\'s voice; the very south-country\r\npronunciation, that Mary so well remembered; and which she had\r\nsometimes tried to imitate when alone, with the fond mimicry of\r\naffection.\r\n\r\nSo, without fear, without hesitation, she rose and unbarred the\r\ndoor.  There, against the moonlight, stood a form, so closely\r\nresembling her dead mother, that Mary never doubted the identity,\r\nbut exclaiming (as if she were a terrified child, secure of safety\r\nwhen near the protecting care of its parent)--\r\n\r\n"O mother! mother! you are come at last?" she threw herself, or\r\nrather fell, into the trembling arms of her long-lost, unrecognised\r\naunt, Esther.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI.   ESTHER\'S MOTIVE IN SEEKING MARY.\r\n\r\n     "My rest is gone,\r\n        My heart is sore,\r\n      Peace find I never,\r\n        And never more."\r\n                    --MARGARET\'S SONG IN "FAUST."\r\n\r\nI must go back a little to explain the motives which caused Esther\r\nto seek an interview with her niece.\r\n\r\nThe murder had been committed early on Thursday night, and between\r\nthen and the dawn of the following day there was ample time for the\r\nnews to spread far and wide among all those whose duty, or whose\r\nwant, or whose errors, caused them to be abroad in the streets of\r\nManchester.\r\n\r\nAmong those who listened to the tale of violence was Esther.\r\n\r\nA craving desire to know more took possession of her mind.  Far away\r\nas she was from Turner Street, she immediately set off to the scene\r\nof the murder, which was faintly lighted by the grey dawn as she\r\nreached the spot.  It was so quiet and still that she could hardly\r\nbelieve it to be the place.  The only vestige of any scuffle or\r\nviolence was a trail on the dust, as if somebody had been lying\r\nthere, and then been raised by extraneous force.  The little birds\r\nwere beginning to hop and twitter in the leafless hedge, making the\r\nonly sound that was near and distinct.  She crossed into the field\r\nwhere she guessed the murderer to have stood; it was easy of access,\r\nfor the worn, stunted hawthorn-hedge had many gaps in it.  The\r\nnight-smell of bruised grass came up from under her feet, as she\r\nwent towards the saw-pit and carpenter\'s shed which, as I have said\r\nbefore, were in a corner of the field near the road, and where one\r\nof her informants had told her it was supposed by the police that\r\nthe murderer had lurked while waiting for his victim.  There was no\r\nsign, however, that any one had been about the place.  If the grass\r\nhad been bruised or bent where he had trod, it had had enough of the\r\nelasticity of life to raise itself under the dewy influences of\r\nnight.  She hushed her breath in involuntary awe, but nothing else\r\ntold of the violent deed by which a fellow-creature had passed away.\r\nShe stood still for a minute, imagining to herself the position of\r\nthe parties, guided by the only circumstance which afforded any\r\nevidence, the trailing mark on the dust in the road.\r\n\r\nSuddenly (it was before the sun had risen above the horizon) she\r\nbecame aware of something white in the hedge.  All other colours\r\nwore the same murky hue, though the forms of objects were perfectly\r\ndistinct.  What was it?  It could not be a flower;--that, the time\r\nof year made clear.  A frozen lump of snow, lingering late in one of\r\nthe gnarled tufts of the hedge?  She stepped forward to examine.  It\r\nproved to be a little piece of stiff writing-paper compressed into a\r\nround shape.  She understood it instantly; it was the paper that had\r\nserved as wadding for the murderer\'s gun.  Then she had been\r\nstanding just where the murderer must have been but a few hours\r\nbefore; probably (as the rumour had spread through the town,\r\nreaching her ears) one of the poor maddened turn-outs, who hung\r\nabout everywhere, with black, fierce looks, as if contemplating some\r\ndeed of violence.  Her sympathy was all with them, for she had known\r\nwhat they suffered; and besides this, there was her own individual\r\ndislike of Mr. Carson, and dread of him for Mary\'s sake.  Yet, poor\r\nMary!  Death was a terrible, though sure, remedy for the evil Esther\r\nhad dreaded for her; and how would she stand the shock, loving as\r\nher aunt believed her to do?  Poor Mary! who would comfort her?\r\nEsther\'s thoughts began to picture her sorrow, her despair, when the\r\nnews of her lover\'s death should reach her; and she longed to tell\r\nher there might have been a keener grief yet had he lived.\r\n\r\nBright, beautiful came the slanting rays of the morning sun.  It was\r\ntime for such as she to hide themselves, with the other obscene\r\nthings of night, from the glorious light of day, which was only for\r\nthe happy.  So she turned her steps towards town, still holding the\r\npaper.  But in getting over the hedge it encumbered her to hold it\r\nin her clasped hand, and she threw it down.  She passed on a few\r\nsteps, her thoughts still of Mary, till the idea crossed her mind,\r\ncould it (blank as it appeared to be) give any clue to the murderer?\r\nAs I said before, her sympathies were all on that side, so she\r\nturned back and picked it up; and then feeling as if in some measure\r\nan accessory, she hid it unexamined in her hand, and hastily passed\r\nout of the street at the opposite end to that by which she had\r\nentered it.\r\n\r\nAnd what do you think she felt, when having walked some distance\r\nfrom the spot, she dared to open the crushed paper, and saw written\r\non it Mary Barton\'s name, and not only that, but the street in which\r\nshe lived!  True, a letter or two was torn off, but, nevertheless,\r\nthere was the name clear to be recognised.  And oh! what terrible\r\nthought flashed into her mind; or was it only fancy?  But it looked\r\nvery like the writing which she had once known well--the writing of\r\nJem Wilson, who, when she lived at her brother-in-law\'s, and he was\r\na near neighbour, had often been employed by her to write her\r\nletters to people, to whom she was ashamed of sending her own\r\nmisspelt scrawl.  She remembered the wonderful flourishes she had so\r\nmuch admired in those days, while she sat by dictating, and Jem, in\r\nall the pride of newly-acquired penmanship, used to dazzle her eyes\r\nby extraordinary graces and twirls.\r\n\r\nIf it were his!\r\n\r\nOh! perhaps it was merely that her head was running so on Mary, that\r\nshe was associating every trifle with her.  As if only one person\r\nwrote in that flourishing, meandering style!\r\n\r\nIt was enough to fill her mind to think from what she might have\r\nsaved Mary by securing the paper.  She would look at it just once\r\nmore, and see if some very dense and stupid policeman could have\r\nmistaken the name, or if Mary would certainly have been dragged into\r\nnotice in the affair.\r\n\r\nNo! no one could have mistaken the "ry Barton," and it WAS Jem\'s\r\nhandwriting!\r\n\r\nOh! if it was so, she understood it all, and she had been the cause!\r\nWith her violent and unregulated nature, rendered morbid by the\r\ncourse of life she led, and her consciousness of her degradation,\r\nshe cursed herself for the interference which she believed had led\r\nto this; for the information and the warning she had given to Jem,\r\nwhich had roused him to this murderous action.  How could she, the\r\nabandoned and polluted outcast, ever have dared to hope for a\r\nblessing, even on her efforts to do good.  The black curse of Heaven\r\nrested on all her doings, were they for good or for evil.\r\n\r\nPoor, diseased mind! and there were none to minister to thee!\r\n\r\nSo she wandered about, too restless to take her usual heavy\r\nmorning\'s sleep, up and down the streets, greedily listening to\r\nevery word of the passers-by, and loitering near each group of\r\ntalkers, anxious to scrape together every morsel of information, or\r\nconjecture, or suspicion, though without possessing any definite\r\npurpose in all this.  And ever and always she clenched the scrap of\r\npaper which might betray so much, until her nails had deeply\r\nindented the palm of her hand; so fearful was she in her nervous\r\ndread, lest unawares she should let it drop.\r\n\r\nTowards the middle of the day she could no longer evade the body\'s\r\ncraving want of rest and refreshment; but the rest was taken in a\r\nspirit vault, and the refreshment was a glass of gin.\r\n\r\nThen she started up from the stupor she had taken for repose; and\r\nsuddenly driven before the gusty impulses of her mind, she pushed\r\nher way to the place where at that very time the police were\r\nbringing the information they had gathered with regard to the\r\nall-engrossing murder.\r\n\r\nShe listened with painful acuteness of comprehension to dropped\r\nwords, and unconnected sentences, the meaning of which became\r\nclearer, and yet more clear to her.  Jem was suspected.  Jem was\r\nascertained to be the murderer.\r\n\r\nShe saw him (although he, absorbed in deep sad thought, saw her\r\nnot), she saw him brought handcuffed and guarded out of the coach.\r\nShe saw him enter the station--she gasped for breath till he came\r\nout, still handcuffed, and still guarded, to be conveyed to the New\r\nBailey.\r\n\r\nHe was the only one who had spoken to her with hope that she might\r\nwin her way back to virtue.  His words had lingered in her heart\r\nwith a sort of call to heaven, like distant Sabbath bells, although\r\nin her despair she had turned away from his voice.  He was the only\r\none who had spoken to her kindly.  The murder, shocking though it\r\nwas, was an absent, abstract thing, on which her thoughts could not,\r\nand would not dwell: all that was present in her mind was Jem\'s\r\ndanger, and his kindness.\r\n\r\nThen Mary came to remembrance.  Esther wondered till she was sick of\r\nwondering, in what way she was taking the affair.  In some manner it\r\nwould be a terrible blow for the poor, motherless girl; with her\r\ndreadful father, too, who was to Esther a sort of accusing angel.\r\n\r\nShe set off towards the court where Mary lived, to pick up what she\r\ncould there of information.  But she was ashamed to enter in where\r\nonce she had been innocent, and hung about the neighbouring streets,\r\nnot daring to question, so she learnt but little; nothing, in fact,\r\nbut the knowledge of John Barton\'s absence from home.\r\n\r\nShe went up a dark entry to rest her weary limbs on a doorstep and\r\nthink.  Her elbows on her knees, her face hidden in her hands, she\r\ntried to gather together and arrange her thoughts.  But still every\r\nnow and then she opened her hand to see if the paper were yet there.\r\n\r\nShe got up at last.  She had formed a plan, and had a course of\r\naction to look forward to that would satisfy one craving desire at\r\nleast.  The time was long gone by when there was much wisdom or\r\nconsistency in her projects.\r\n\r\nIt was getting late, and that was so much the better.  She went to a\r\npawnshop, and took off her finery in a back room.  She was known by\r\nthe people, and had a character for honesty, so she had no very\r\ngreat difficulty in inducing them to let her have a suit of outer\r\nclothes, befitting the wife of a working-man, a black silk bonnet, a\r\nprinted gown, a plaid shawl, dirty and rather worn to be sure, but\r\nwhich had a sort of sanctity to the eyes of the street-walker as\r\nbeing the appropriate garb of that happy class to which she could\r\nnever, never more belong.\r\n\r\nShe looked at herself in the little glass which hung against the\r\nwall, and sadly shaking her head thought how easy were the duties of\r\nthat Eden of innocence from which she was shut out; how she would\r\nwork, and toil, and starve, and die, if necessary, for a husband, a\r\nhome--for children--but that thought she could not bear; a little\r\nform rose up, stern in its innocence, from the witches\' caldron of\r\nher imagination, and she rushed into action again.\r\n\r\nYou know now how she came to stand by the threshold of Mary\'s door,\r\nwaiting, trembling, until the latch was lifted, and her niece, with\r\nwords that spoke of such desolation among the living, fell into her\r\narms.\r\n\r\nShe had felt as if some holy spell would prevent her (even as the\r\nunholy Lady Geraldine was prevented, in the abode of Christabel)\r\nfrom crossing the threshold of that home of her early innocence; and\r\nshe had meant to wait for an invitation.  But Mary\'s helpless action\r\ndid away with all reluctant feeling, and she bore or dragged her to\r\nher seat, and looked on her bewildered eyes, as, puzzled with the\r\nlikeness, which was not identity, she gazed on her aunt\'s features.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of her plan, Esther meant to assume the manners and\r\ncharacter, as she had done the dress, of a mechanic\'s wife; but\r\nthen, to account for her long absence, and her long silence towards\r\nall that ought to have been dear to her, it was necessary that she\r\nshould put on an indifference far distant from her heart, which was\r\nloving and yearning, in spite of all its faults.  And, perhaps, she\r\nover-acted her part, for certainly Mary felt a kind of repugnance to\r\nthe changed and altered aunt, who so suddenly reappeared on the\r\nscene; and it would have cut Esther to the very core, could she have\r\nknown how her little darling of former days was feeling towards her.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t remember me, I see, Mary!" she began.  "It\'s a long while\r\nsince I left you all, to be sure; and I, many a time, thought of\r\ncoming to see you, and--and your father.  But I live so far off, and\r\nam always so busy, I cannot do just what I wish.  You recollect aunt\r\nEsther, don\'t you, Mary?"\r\n\r\n"Are you Aunt Hetty?" asked Mary faintly, still looking at the face\r\nwhich was so different from the old recollections of her aunt\'s\r\nfresh dazzling beauty.\r\n\r\n"Yes! I am Aunt Hetty.  Oh! it\'s so long since I heard that name,"\r\nsighing forth the thoughts it suggested; then, recovering herself,\r\nand striving after the hard character she wished to assume, she\r\ncontinued: "And to-day I heard a friend of yours, and of mine too,\r\nlong ago, was in trouble, and I guessed you would be in sorrow, so I\r\nthought I would just step this far and see you."\r\n\r\nMary\'s tears flowed afresh, but she had no desire to open her heart\r\nto her strangely-found aunt, who had, by her own confession, kept\r\naloof from and neglected them for so many years.  Yet she tried to\r\nfeel grateful for kindness (however late) from any one, and wished\r\nto be civil.  Moreover, she had a strong disinclination to speak on\r\nthe terrible subject uppermost in her mind.\r\n\r\nSo, after a pause, she said--\r\n\r\n"Thank you.  I dare say you mean very kind.  Have you had a long\r\nwalk?  I\'m so sorry," said she, rising with a sudden thought, which\r\nwas as suddenly checked by recollection, "but I\'ve nothing to eat in\r\nthe house, and I\'m sure you must be hungry, after your walk."\r\n\r\nFor Mary concluded that certainly her aunt\'s residence must be far\r\naway on the other side of the town, out of sight or hearing.  But,\r\nafter all, she did not think much about her; her heart was so\r\naching-full of other things, that all besides seemed like a dream.\r\nShe received feelings and impressions from her conversation with her\r\naunt, but did not, could not, put them together, or think or argue\r\nabout them.\r\n\r\nAnd Esther! How scanty had been her food for days and weeks, her\r\nthinly-covered bones and pale lips might tell, but her words should\r\nnever reveal!\r\n\r\nSo, with a little unreal laugh, she replied--\r\n\r\n"Oh! Mary, my dear! don\'t talk about eating.  We\'ve the best of\r\neverything, and plenty of it, for my husband is in good work.  I\'d\r\nsuch a supper before I came out.  I couldn\'t touch a morsel if you\r\nhad it."\r\n\r\nHer words shot a strange pang through Mary\'s heart.  She had always\r\nremembered her aunt\'s loving and unselfish disposition; how was it\r\nchanged, if, living in plenty, she had never thought it worth while\r\nto ask after her relations who were all but starving!  She shut up\r\nher heart instinctively against her aunt.\r\n\r\nAnd all the time poor Esther was swallowing her sobs, and over-\r\nacting her part, and controlling herself more than she had done for\r\nmany a long day, in order that her niece might not be shocked and\r\nrevolted, by the knowledge of what her aunt had become--a\r\nprostitute; an outcast.\r\n\r\nShe had longed to open her wretched, wretched heart, so hopeless, so\r\nabandoned by all living things, to one who had loved her once; and\r\nyet she refrained, from dread of the averted eye, the altered voice,\r\nthe internal loathing, which she feared such disclosure might\r\ncreate.  She would go straight to the subject of the day.  She could\r\nnot tarry long, for she felt unable to support the character she had\r\nassumed for any length of time.\r\n\r\nThey sat by the little round table, facing each other.  The candle\r\nwas placed right between them, and Esther moved it in order to have\r\na clearer view of Mary\'s face, so that she might read her emotions,\r\nand ascertain her interests.\r\n\r\nThen she began--\r\n\r\n"It\'s a bad business, I\'m afraid, this of Mr. Carson\'s murder."\r\n\r\nMary winced a little.\r\n\r\n"I hear Jem Wilson is taken up for it."\r\n\r\nMary covered her eyes with her hands, as if to shade them from the\r\nlight, and Esther herself, less accustomed to self-command, was\r\ngetting too much agitated for calm observation of another.\r\n\r\n"I was taking a walk near Turner Street, and I went to see the\r\nspot," continued Esther, "and, as luck would have it, I spied this\r\nbit of paper in the hedge," producing the precious piece still\r\nfolded in her hand.  "It has been used as wadding for the gun, I\r\nreckon; indeed, that\'s clear enough, from the shape it\'s crammed\r\ninto.  I was sorry for the murderer, whoever he might be (I didn\'t\r\nthen know of Jem\'s being suspected), and I thought I would never\r\nleave a thing about as might help, ever so little, to convict him;\r\nthe police are so \'cute about straws.  So I carried it a little way,\r\nand then I opened it and saw your name, Mary."\r\n\r\nMary took her hands away from her eyes, and looked with surprise at\r\nher aunt\'s face, as she uttered these words.  She WAS kind after\r\nall, for was she not saving her from being summoned, and from being\r\nquestioned and examined; a thing to be dreaded above all others:\r\nas she felt sure that her unwilling answers, frame them how she\r\nmight, would add to the suspicions against Jem; her aunt was indeed\r\nkind, to think of what would spare her this.\r\n\r\nEsther went on, without noticing Mary\'s look.  The very action of\r\nspeaking was so painful to her, and so much interrupted by the hard,\r\nraking little cough, which had been her constant annoyance for\r\nmonths, that she was too much engrossed by the physical difficulty\r\nof utterance, to be a very close observer.\r\n\r\n"There could be no mistake if they had found it.  Look at your name,\r\ntogether with the very name of this court!  And in Jem\'s handwriting\r\ntoo, or I\'m much mistaken.  Look, Mary!"\r\n\r\nAnd now she did watch her.\r\n\r\nMary took the paper and flattened it; then suddenly stood stiff up,\r\nwith irrepressible movement, as if petrified by some horror abruptly\r\ndisclosed; her face, strung and rigid; her lips compressed tight, to\r\nkeep down some rising exclamation.  She dropped on her seat, as\r\nsuddenly as if the braced muscles had in an instant given way.  But\r\nshe spoke no word.\r\n\r\n"It is his handwriting--isn\'t it?" asked Esther, though Mary\'s\r\nmanner was almost confirmation enough.\r\n\r\n"You will not tell.  You never will tell?" demanded Mary, in a tone\r\nso sternly earnest, as almost to be threatening.\r\n\r\n"Nay, Mary," said Esther, rather reproachfully, "I am not so bad as\r\nthat.  O Mary, you cannot think I would do that, whatever I may be."\r\n\r\nThe tears sprang to her eyes at the idea that she was suspected of\r\nbeing one who would help to inform against an old friend.\r\n\r\nMary caught her sad and upbraiding look.\r\n\r\n"No! I know you would not tell, aunt.  I don\'t know what I say, I am\r\nso shocked.  But say you will not tell.  Do."\r\n\r\n"No, indeed I willn\'t tell, come what may."\r\n\r\nMary sat still looking at the writing, and turning the paper round\r\nwith careful examination, trying to hope, but her very fears belying\r\nher hopes.\r\n\r\n"I thought you cared for the young man that\'s murdered," observed\r\nEsther, half-aloud; but feeling that she could not mistake this\r\nstrange interest in the suspected murderer, implied by Mary\'s\r\neagerness to screen him from anything which might strengthen\r\nsuspicion against him.  She had come, desirous to know the extent of\r\nMary\'s grief for Mr. Carson, and glad of the excuse afforded her by\r\nthe important scrap of paper.  Her remark about its being Jem\'s\r\nhandwriting, she had, with this view of ascertaining Mary\'s state of\r\nfeeling, felt to be most imprudent the instant after she had uttered\r\nit; but Mary\'s anxiety that she should not tell was too great, and\r\ntoo decided, to leave a doubt as to her interest for Jem.  She grew\r\nmore and more bewildered, and her dizzy head refused to reason.\r\nMary never spoke.  She held the bit of paper firmly, determined to\r\nretain possession of it, come what might; and anxious, and\r\nimpatient, for her aunt to go.  As she sat, her face bore a likeness\r\nto Esther\'s dead child.\r\n\r\n"You are so like my little girl, Mary!" said Esther, weary of the\r\none subject on which she could get no satisfaction, and recurring,\r\nwith full heart, to the thought of the dead.\r\n\r\nMary looked up.  Her aunt had children, then.  That was all the idea\r\nshe received.  No faint imagination of the love and the woe of that\r\npoor creature crossed her mind, or she would have taken her, all\r\nguilty and erring, to her bosom, and tried to bind up the broken\r\nheart.  No! it was not to be.  Her aunt had children, then; and she\r\nwas on the point of putting some question about them, but before it\r\ncould be spoken another thought turned it aside, and she went back\r\nto her task of unravelling the mystery of the paper, and the\r\nhandwriting.  Oh! how she wished her aunt would go!\r\n\r\nAs if, according to the believers in mesmerism, the intenseness of\r\nher wish gave her power over another, although the wish was\r\nunexpressed, Esther felt herself unwelcome, and that her absence was\r\ndesired.\r\n\r\nShe felt this some time before she could summon up resolution to go.\r\nShe was so much disappointed in this longed-for, dreaded interview\r\nwith Mary; she had wished to impose upon her with her tale of\r\nmarried respectability, and yet she had yearned and craved for\r\nsympathy in her real lot.  And she had imposed upon her well.  She\r\nshould perhaps be glad of it afterwards; but her desolation of hope\r\nseemed for the time redoubled.  And she must leave the old\r\ndwelling-place, whose very walls, and flags, dingy and sordid as\r\nthey were, had a charm for her.  Must leave the abode of poverty,\r\nfor the more terrible abodes of vice.  She must--she would go.\r\n\r\n"Well, good-night, Mary.  That bit of paper is safe enough with you,\r\nI see.  But you made me promise I would not tell about it, and you\r\nmust promise me to destroy it before you sleep."\r\n\r\n"I promise," said Mary hoarsely, but firmly.  "Then you are going?"\r\n\r\n"Yes.  Not if you wish me to stay.  Not if I could be of any comfort\r\nto you, Mary"; catching at some glimmering hope.\r\n\r\n"Oh no," said Mary, anxious to be alone.  "Your husband will be\r\nwondering where you are.  Some day you must tell me all about\r\nyourself.  I forget what your name is?"\r\n\r\n"Fergusson," said Esther sadly.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Fergusson," repeated Mary half unconsciously.  "And where did\r\nyou say you lived?"\r\n\r\n"I never did say," muttered Esther; then aloud, "In Angel\'s Meadow,\r\n145, Nicholas Street."\r\n\r\n"145, Nicholas Street, Angel Meadow.  I shall remember."\r\n\r\nAs Esther drew her shawl around her, and prepared to depart, a\r\nthought crossed Mary\'s mind that she had been cold and hard in her\r\nmanner towards one, who had certainly meant to act kindly in\r\nbringing her the paper (that dread, terrible piece of paper!) and\r\nthus saving her from--she could not rightly think how much, or how\r\nlittle she was spared.  So desirous of making up for her previous\r\nindifferent manner, she advanced to kiss her aunt before her\r\ndeparture.\r\n\r\nBut, to her surprise, her aunt pushed her off with a frantic kind of\r\ngesture, and saying the words--\r\n\r\n"Not me.  You must never kiss me.  You!"\r\n\r\nShe rushed into the outer darkness of the street, and there wept\r\nlong and bitterly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII.   MARY\'S EFFORTS TO PROVE AN ALIBI.\r\n\r\n     "There was a listening fear in her regard,\r\n      As if calamity had but begun;\r\n      As if the vanward clouds of evil days\r\n      Had spent their malice, and the sullen rear\r\n      Was, with its stored thunder, labouring up."\r\n                                     --KEATS\' Hyperion.\r\n\r\nNo sooner was Mary alone than she fastened the door, and put the\r\nshutters up against the window, which had all this time remained\r\nshaded only by the curtains hastily drawn together on Esther\'s\r\nentrance, and the lighting of the candle.\r\n\r\nShe did all this with the same compressed lips, and the same stony\r\nlook that her face had assumed on the first examination of the\r\npaper.  Then she sat down for an instant to think; and rising\r\ndirectly, went, with a step rendered firm by inward resolution of\r\npurpose, up the stairs; passed her own door, two steps, into her\r\nfather\'s room.  What did she want there?\r\n\r\nI must tell you; I must put into words the dreadful secret which she\r\nbelieved that bit of paper had revealed to her.\r\n\r\nHer father was the murderer.\r\n\r\nThat corner of stiff, shining, thick, writing paper, she recognised\r\nas a part of the sheet on which she had copied Samuel Bamford\'s\r\nbeautiful lines so many months ago--copied (as you perhaps remember)\r\non the blank part of a valentine sent to her by Jem Wilson, in those\r\ndays when she did not treasure and hoard up everything he had\r\ntouched, as she would do now.\r\n\r\nThat copy had been given to her father, for whom it was made, and\r\nshe had occasionally seen him reading it over, not a fortnight ago\r\nshe was sure.  But she resolved to ascertain if the other part still\r\nremained in his possession.  He might--it was just possible he\r\nMIGHT, have given it away to some friend; and if so, that person was\r\nthe guilty one, for she could swear to the paper anywhere.\r\n\r\nFirst of all she pulled out every article from the little old chest\r\nof drawers.  Amongst them were some things which had belonged to her\r\nmother, but she had no time now to examine and try and remember\r\nthem.  All the reverence she could pay them was to carry them and\r\nlay them on the bed carefully, while the other things were tossed\r\nimpatiently out upon the floor.\r\n\r\nThe copy of Bamford\'s lines was not there.  Oh! perhaps he might\r\nhave given it away; but then must it not have been to Jem?  It was\r\nhis gun.\r\n\r\nAnd she set to with redoubled vigour to examine the deal box which\r\nserved as chair, and which had once contained her father\'s Sunday\r\nclothes, in the days when he could afford to have Sunday clothes.\r\n\r\nHe had redeemed his better coat from the pawn-shop before he left,\r\nthat she had noticed.  Here was his old one.  What rustled under her\r\nhand in the pocket?\r\n\r\nThe paper!  "O father!"\r\n\r\nYes, it fitted; jagged end to jagged end, letter to letter, and even\r\nthe part which Esther had considered blank had its tallying mark\r\nwith the larger piece, its tails of ys and gs.  And then, as if that\r\nwere not damning evidence enough, she felt again, and found some\r\nlittle bullets or shot (I don\'t know which you would call them) in\r\nthat same pocket, along with a small paper parcel of gunpowder.  As\r\nshe was going to replace the jacket, having abstracted the paper,\r\nand bullets, etc., she saw a woollen gun-case made of that sort of\r\nstriped horse-cloth you must have seen a thousand times appropriated\r\nto such a purpose.  The sight of it made her examine still further,\r\nbut there was nothing else that could afford any evidence, so she\r\nlocked the box, and sat down on the floor to contemplate the\r\narticles; now with a sickening despair, now with a kind of wondering\r\ncuriosity, how her father had managed to evade observation.  After\r\nall it was easy enough.  He had evidently got possession of some gun\r\n(was it really Jem\'s? was he an accomplice?  No! she did not believe\r\nit; he never, never would deliberately plan a murder with another,\r\nhowever he might be wrought up to it by passionate feeling at the\r\ntime.  Least of all would he accuse her to her father, without\r\npreviously warning her; it was out of his nature).\r\n\r\nThen having obtained possession of the gun, her father had loaded it\r\nat home, and might have carried it away with him some time when the\r\nneighbours were not noticing, and she was out, or asleep; and then\r\nhe might have hidden it somewhere to be in readiness when he should\r\nwant it.  She was sure he had no such thing with him when he went\r\naway the last time.\r\n\r\nShe felt it was of no use to conjecture his motives.  His actions\r\nhad become so wild and irregular of late, that she could not reason\r\nupon them.  Besides, was it not enough to know that he was guilty of\r\nthis terrible offence?  Her love for her father seemed to return\r\nwith painful force, mixed up as it was with horror at his crime.\r\nThat dear father who was once so kind, so warm-hearted, so ready to\r\nhelp either man or beast in distress, to murder!  But in the desert\r\nof misery with which these thoughts surrounded her, the arid depths\r\nof whose gloom she dared not venture to contemplate, a little spring\r\nof comfort was gushing up at her feet, unnoticed at first, but soon\r\nto give her strength and hope.\r\n\r\nAnd THAT was the necessity for exertion on her part which this\r\ndiscovery enforced.\r\n\r\nOh! I do think that the necessity for exertion, for some kind of\r\naction (bodily or mental) in time of distress, is a most infinite\r\nblessing, although the first efforts at such seasons are painful.\r\nSomething to be done implies that there is yet hope of some good\r\nthing to be accomplished, or some additional evil that may be\r\navoided; and by degrees the hope absorbs much of the sorrow.\r\n\r\nIt is the woes that cannot in any earthly way be escaped that admit\r\nleast earthly comforting.  Of all trite, worn-out, hollow mockeries\r\nof comfort that were ever uttered by people who will not take the\r\ntrouble of sympathising with others, the one I dislike the most is\r\nthe exhortation not to grieve over an event, "for it cannot be\r\nhelped."  Do you think if I could help it, I would sit still with\r\nfolded hands, content to mourn?  Do you not believe that as long as\r\nhope remained I would be up and doing?  I mourn because what has\r\noccurred cannot be helped.  The reason you give me for not grieving,\r\nis the very sole reason of my grief.  Give me nobler and higher\r\nreasons for enduring meekly what my Father sees fit to send, and I\r\nwill try earnestly and faithfully to be patient; but mock me not, or\r\nany other mourner, with the speech, "Do not grieve, for it cannot be\r\nhelped.  It is past remedy."\r\n\r\nBut some remedy to Mary\'s sorrow came with thinking.  If her father\r\nwas guilty, Jem was innocent.  If innocent, there was a possibility\r\nof saving him.  He must be saved.  And she must do it; for, was not\r\nshe the sole depository of the terrible secret?  Her father was not\r\nsuspected; and never should be, if by any foresight or any exertions\r\nof her own she could prevent it.\r\n\r\nShe did not know how Jem was to be saved, while her father was also\r\nto be considered innocent.  It would require much thought and much\r\nprudence.  But with the call upon her exertions, and her various\r\nqualities of judgment and discretion, came the answering\r\nconsciousness of innate power to meet the emergency.  Every step\r\nnow, nay, the employment of every minute was of consequence; for you\r\nmust remember she had learnt at Miss Simmonds\' the probability that\r\nthe murderer would be brought to trial the next week.  And you must\r\nremember, too, that never was so young a girl so friendless, or so\r\npenniless, as Mary was at this time.  But the lion accompanied Una\r\nthrough the wilderness and the danger; and so will a high, resolved\r\npurpose of right-doing ever guard and accompany the helpless.\r\n\r\nIt struck two; deep, mirk night.\r\n\r\nIt was of no use bewildering herself with plans this weary, endless\r\nnight.  Nothing could be done before morning; and, at first in her\r\nimpatience, she began to long for day; but then she felt in how\r\nunfit a state her body was for any plan of exertion, and she\r\nresolutely made up her mind to husband her physical strength.\r\n\r\nFirst of all she must burn the tell-tale paper.  The powder,\r\nbullets, and gun-case, she tied into a bundle, and hid in the\r\nsacking of the bed for the present, although there was no likelihood\r\nof their affording evidence against any one.  Then she carried the\r\npaper downstairs, and burned it on the hearth, powdering the very\r\nashes with her fingers, and dispersing the fragments of fluttering\r\nblack films among the cinders of the grate.  Then she breathed\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nHer head ached with dizzying violence; she must get quit of the pain\r\nor it would incapacitate her for thinking and planning.  She looked\r\nfor food, but there was nothing but a little raw oatmeal in the\r\nhouse: still, although it almost choked her, she ate some of this,\r\nknowing from experience, how often headaches were caused by long\r\nfasting.  Then she sought for some water to bathe her throbbing\r\ntemples, and quench her feverish thirst.  There was none in the\r\nhouse, so she took the jug and went out to the pump at the other end\r\nof the court, whose echoes resounded her light footsteps in the\r\nquiet stillness of the night.  The hard, square outlines of the\r\nhouses cut sharply against the cold bright sky, from which myriads\r\nof stars were shining down in eternal repose.  There was little\r\nsympathy in the outward scene, with the internal trouble.  All was\r\nso still, so motionless, so hard!  Very different to this lovely\r\nnight in the country in which I am now writing, where the distant\r\nhorizon is soft and undulating in the moonlight, and the nearer\r\ntrees sway gently to and fro in the night-wind with something of\r\nalmost human motion; and the rustling air makes music among their\r\nbranches, as if speaking soothingly to the weary ones who lie awake\r\nin heaviness of heart.  The sights and sounds of such a night lull\r\npain and grief to rest.\r\n\r\nBut Mary re-entered her home after she had filled her pitcher, with\r\na still stronger sense of anxiety, and a still clearer conviction of\r\nhow much rested upon her unassisted and friendless self, alone with\r\nher terrible knowledge, in the hard, cold, populous world.\r\n\r\nShe bathed her forehead, and quenched her thirst, and then, with\r\nwise deliberation of purpose, went upstairs, and undressed herself,\r\nas if for a long night\'s slumber, although so few hours intervened\r\nbefore day-dawn.  She believed she never could sleep, but she lay\r\ndown, and shut her eyes; and before many minutes she was in as deep\r\nand sound a slumber as if there was no sin or sorrow in the world.\r\n\r\nShe woke up, as it was natural, much refreshed in body; but with a\r\nconsciousness of some great impending calamity.  She sat up in bed\r\nto recollect, and when she did remember, she sank down again with\r\nall the helplessness of despair.  But it was only the weakness of an\r\ninstant; for were not the very minutes precious, for deliberation if\r\nnot for action?\r\n\r\nBefore she had finished the necessary morning business of dressing,\r\nand setting her house in some kind of order, she had disentangled\r\nher ravelled ideas, and arranged some kind of a plan for action.  If\r\nJem was innocent (and now of his guilt, even his slightest\r\nparticipation in, or knowledge of, the murder, she acquitted him\r\nwith all her heart and soul), he must have been somewhere else when\r\nthe crime was committed; probably with some others, who might bear\r\nwitness to the fact, if she only knew where to find them.\r\nEverything rested on her.  She had heard of an alibi, and believed\r\nit might mean the deliverance she wished to accomplish; but she was\r\nnot quite sure, and determined to apply to Job, as one of the few\r\namong her acquaintance gifted with the knowledge of hard words, for\r\nto her, all terms of law, or natural history, were alike\r\nmany-syllabled mysteries.\r\n\r\nNo time was to be lost.  She went straight to Job Legh\'s house, and\r\nfound the old man and his grand-daughter sitting at breakfast; as\r\nshe opened the door she heard their voices speaking in a grave,\r\nhushed, subdued tone, as if something grieved their hearts.  They\r\nstopped talking on her entrance, and then she knew they had been\r\nconversing about the murder; about Jem\'s probable guilt; and (it\r\nflashed upon her for the first time) on the new light they would\r\nhave obtained regarding herself: for until now they had never\r\nheard of her giddy flirting with Mr. Carson; not in all her\r\nconfidential talk with Margaret had she ever spoken of him.  And\r\nnow, Margaret would hear her conduct talked of by all, as that of a\r\nbold, bad girl; and even if she did not believe everything that was\r\nsaid, she could hardly help feeling wounded, and disappointed in\r\nMary.\r\n\r\nSo it was in a timid voice that Mary wished her usual good-morrow,\r\nand her heart sunk within her a little, when Job, with a form of\r\ncivility, bade her welcome in that dwelling, where, until now, she\r\nhad been too well assured to require to be asked to sit down.\r\n\r\nShe took a chair.  Margaret continued silent.\r\n\r\n"I\'m come to speak to you about this--about Jem Wilson."\r\n\r\n"It\'s a bad business, I\'m afeard," replied Job sadly.\r\n\r\n"Ay, it\'s bad enough anyhow.  But Jem\'s innocent.  Indeed he is; I\'m\r\nas sure as sure can be."\r\n\r\n"How can you know, wench?  Facts bear strong again him, poor fellow,\r\nthough he\'d a deal to put him up, and aggravate him, they say.  Ay,\r\npoor lad, he\'s done for himself, I\'m afeard."\r\n\r\n"Job," said Mary, rising from her chair in her eagerness, "you must\r\nnot say he did it.  He didn\'t; I\'m sure and certain he didn\'t.  Oh!\r\nwhy do you shake your head?  Who is to believe me,--who is to think\r\nhim innocent, if you, who know\'d him so well, stick to it he\'s\r\nguilty?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m loth enough to do it, lass," replied Job; "but I think he\'s\r\nbeen ill-used, and--jilted (that\'s plain truth, Mary, bare as it may\r\nseem), and his blood has been up--many a man has done the like\r\nafore, from like causes."\r\n\r\n"O God!  Then you won\'t help me, Job, to prove him innocent?  O Job,\r\nJob! believe me, Jem never did harm to no one."\r\n\r\n"Not afore;--and mind, wench! I don\'t over-blame him for this."  Job\r\nrelapsed into silence.\r\n\r\nMary thought a moment.\r\n\r\n"Well, Job, you\'ll not refuse me this, I know.  I won\'t mind what\r\nyou think, if you\'ll help me as if he was innocent.  Now suppose I\r\nknow--I knew, he was innocent,--it\'s only supposing, Job,--what must\r\nI do to prove it?  Tell me, Job!  Isn\'t it called an alibi, the\r\ngetting folk to swear to where he really was at the time?"\r\n\r\n"Best way, if you know\'d him innocent, would be to find out the real\r\nmurderer.  Some one did it, that\'s clear enough.  If it wasn\'t Jem\r\nwho was it?"\r\n\r\n"How can I tell?" answered Mary, in agony of terror, lest Job\'s\r\nquestion was prompted by any suspicion of the truth.\r\n\r\nBut he was far enough from any such thought.  Indeed, he had no\r\ndoubt in his own mind that Jem had, in some passionate moment, urged\r\non by slighted love and jealousy, been the murderer.  And he was\r\nstrongly inclined to believe, that Mary was aware of this, only\r\nthat, too late repentant of her light conduct which had led to such\r\nfatal consequences, she was now most anxious to save her old\r\nplayfellow, her early friend, from the doom awaiting the shedder of\r\nblood.\r\n\r\n"If Jem\'s not done it, I don\'t see as any on us can tell who did it.\r\nWe might find out something if we\'d time; but they say he\'s to be\r\ntried on Tuesday.  It\'s no use hiding it, Mary; things looks strong\r\nagainst him."\r\n\r\n"I know they do!  I know they do!  But, O Job! isn\'t an alibi a\r\nproving where he really was at th\' time of the murder; and how must\r\nI set about an alibi?"\r\n\r\n"An alibi is that, sure enough."  He thought a little.  "You mun ask\r\nhis mother his doings, and his whereabouts that night; the knowledge\r\nof that will guide you a bit."\r\n\r\nFor he was anxious that on another should fall the task of\r\nenlightening Mary on the hopelessness of the case, and he felt that\r\nher own sense would be more convinced by inquiry and examination\r\nthan any mere assertion of his.\r\n\r\nMargaret had sat silent and grave all this time.  To tell the truth,\r\nshe was surprised and disappointed by the disclosure of Mary\'s\r\nconduct, with regard to Mr. Henry Carson.  Gentle, reserved, and\r\nprudent herself, never exposed to the trial of being admired for her\r\npersonal appearance, and unsusceptible enough to be in doubt even\r\nyet, whether the fluttering, tender, infinitely joyous feeling she\r\nwas for the first time experiencing, at sight or sound, or thought\r\nof Will Wilson, was love or not,--Margaret had no sympathy with the\r\ntemptations to which loveliness, vanity, ambition, or the desire of\r\nbeing admired, exposes so many; no sympathy with flirting girls, in\r\nshort.  Then, she had no idea of the strength of the conflict\r\nbetween will and principle in some who were differently constituted\r\nfrom herself.  With her, to be convinced that an action was wrong,\r\nwas tantamount to a determination not to do so again; and she had\r\nlittle or no difficulty in carrying out her determination.  So she\r\ncould not understand how it was that Mary had acted wrongly, and had\r\nfelt too much ashamed, in spite of internal sophistry, to speak of\r\nher actions.  Margaret considered herself deceived; felt aggrieved;\r\nand, at the time of which I am now telling you, was strongly\r\ninclined to give Mary up altogether, as a girl devoid of the modest\r\nproprieties of her sex, and capable of gross duplicity, in speaking\r\nof one lover as she had done of Jem, while she was encouraging\r\nanother in attentions, at best of a very doubtful character.\r\n\r\nBut now Margaret was drawn into the conversation.  Suddenly it\r\nflashed across Mary\'s mind, that the night of the murder was the\r\nvery night, or rather the same early morning, that Margaret had been\r\nwith Alice.  She turned sharp round, with--\r\n\r\n"O Margaret, you can tell me; you were there when he came back that\r\nnight; were you not?  No! you were not; but you were there not many\r\nhours after.  Did not you hear where he\'d been?  He was away the\r\nnight before, too, when Alice was first taken; when you were there\r\nfor your tea.  Oh! where was he, Margaret?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," she answered.  "Stay! I do remember something about\r\nhis keeping Will company, in his walk to Liverpool.  I can\'t justly\r\nsay what it was, so much happened that night."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll go to his mother\'s," said Mary resolutely.\r\n\r\nThey neither of them spoke, either to advise or dissuade.  Mary felt\r\nshe had no sympathy from them, and braced up her soul to act without\r\nsuch loving aid of friendship.  She knew that their advice would be\r\nwillingly given at her demand, and that was all she really required\r\nfor Jem\'s sake.  Still her courage failed a little as she walked to\r\nJane Wilson\'s, alone in the world with her secret.\r\n\r\nJane Wilson\'s eyes were swelled with crying; and it was sad to see\r\nthe ravages which intense anxiety and sorrow had made on her\r\nappearance in four-and-twenty hours.  All night long she and Mrs.\r\nDavenport had crooned over their sorrows, always recurring, like the\r\nburden of an old song, to the dreadest sorrow of all, which was now\r\nimpending over Mrs. Wilson.  She had grown--I hardly know what word\r\nto use--but, something like proud of her martyrdom; she had grown to\r\nhug her grief; to feel an excitement in her agony of anxiety about\r\nher boy.\r\n\r\n"So, Mary, you\'re here!  O Mary, lass!  He\'s to be tried on\r\nTuesday."\r\n\r\nShe fell to sobbing, in the convulsive breath-catching manner which\r\ntells of so much previous weeping.\r\n\r\n"O Mrs. Wilson, don\'t take on so!  We\'ll get him off, you\'ll see.\r\nDon\'t fret; they can\'t prove him guilty!"\r\n\r\n"But I tell thee they will," interrupted Mrs. Wilson, half-irritated\r\nat the light way, as she considered it, in which Mary spoke; and a\r\nlittle displeased that another could hope when she had almost\r\nbrought herself to find pleasure in despair.\r\n\r\n"It may suit thee well," continued she, "to make light o\' the misery\r\nthou hast caused; but I shall lay his death at thy door, as long as\r\nI live, and die I know he will; and all for what he never did--no,\r\nhe never did; my own blessed boy!"\r\n\r\nShe was too weak to be angry long; her wrath sank away to feeble\r\nsobbing and worn-out moans.\r\n\r\nMary was most anxious to soothe her from any violence of either\r\ngrief or anger; she did so want her to be clear in her recollection;\r\nand, besides, her tenderness was great towards Jem\'s mother.  So she\r\nspoke in a low gentle tone the loving sentences, which sound so\r\nbroken and powerless in repetition, and which yet have so much power\r\nwhen accompanied with caressing looks and actions, fresh from the\r\nheart; and the old woman insensibly gave herself up to the influence\r\nof those sweet, loving blue eyes, those tears of sympathy, those\r\nwords of love and hope, and was lulled into a less morbid state of\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n"And now, dear Mrs. Wilson, can you remember where he said he was\r\ngoing on Thursday night?  He was out when Alice was taken ill; and\r\nhe did not come home till early in the morning, or, to speak true,\r\nin the night: did he?"\r\n\r\n"Ay! he went out near upon five; he went out with Will; he said he\r\nwere going to set* him a part of the way, for Will were hot upon\r\nwalking to Liverpool, and wouldn\'t hearken to Jem\'s offer of lending\r\nhim five shillings for his fare.  So the two lads set off together.\r\nI mind it all now: but, thou seest, Alice\'s illness, and this\r\nbusiness of poor Jem\'s, drove it out of my head; they went off\r\ntogether, to walk to Liverpool; that\'s to say, Jem were to go a part\r\no\' th\' way.  But, who knows" (falling back into the old desponding\r\ntone) "if he really went?  He might be led off on the road.  O Mary,\r\nwench! they\'ll hang him for what he\'s never done."\r\n\r\n     *"To set," to accompany.\r\n\r\n"No they won\'t, they shan\'t!  I see my way a bit now.  We mun get\r\nWill to help; there\'ll be time.  He can swear that Jem were with\r\nhim.  Where is Jem?"\r\n\r\n"Folk said he were taken to Kirkdale, i\' th\' prison van this\r\nmorning, without my seeing him, poor chap!  O wench! but they\'ve\r\nhurried on the business at a cruel rate."\r\n\r\n"Ay! they\'ve not let grass grow under their feet, in hunting out the\r\nman that did it," said Mary sorrowfully and bitterly.  "But keep up\r\nyour heart.  They got on the wrong scent when they took to\r\nsuspecting Jem.  Don\'t be afeard.  You\'ll see it will end right for\r\nJem."\r\n\r\n"I should mind it less if I could do aught," said Jane Wilson; "but\r\nI\'m such a poor weak old body, and my head\'s so gone, and I\'m so\r\ndazed like, what with Alice and all, that I think and think, and can\r\ndo nought to help my child.  I might ha\' gone and seen him last\r\nnight, they tell me now, and then I missed it.  O Mary, I missed it;\r\nand I may never see the lad again."\r\n\r\nShe looked so piteously in Mary\'s face with her miserable eyes, that\r\nMary felt her heart giving way, and, dreading the weakness of her\r\npowers, which the burst of crying she longed for would occasion,\r\nhastily changed the subject to Alice; and Jane, in her heart,\r\nfeeling that there was no sorrow like a mother\'s sorrow, replied--\r\n\r\n"She keeps on much the same, thank you.  She\'s happy, for she knows\r\nnothing of what\'s going on; but th\' doctor says she grows weaker and\r\nweaker.  Thou\'lt maybe like to see her?"\r\n\r\nMary went upstairs; partly because it is the etiquette in humble\r\nlife to offer to friends a last opportunity of seeing the dying or\r\nthe dead, while the same etiquette forbids a refusal of the\r\ninvitation; and partly because she longed to breathe, for an\r\ninstant, the atmosphere of holy calm, which seemed ever to surround\r\nthe pious, good old woman.  Alice lay, as before, without pain, or\r\nat least any outward expression of it; but totally unconscious of\r\nall present circumstances, and absorbed in recollections of the days\r\nof her girlhood, which were vivid enough to take the place of\r\nreality to her.  Still she talked of green fields, and still she\r\nspoke to the long-dead mother and sister, low-lying in their graves\r\nthis many a year, as if they were with her and about her, in the\r\npleasant places where her youth had passed.\r\n\r\nBut the voice was fainter, the motions were more languid; she was\r\nevidently passing away; but HOW happily!\r\n\r\nMary stood for a time in silence, watching and listening.  Then she\r\nbent down and reverently kissed Alice\'s cheek; and drawing Jane\r\nWilson away from the bed, as if the spirit of her who lay there were\r\nyet cognisant of present realities, she whispered a few words of\r\nhope to the poor mother, and kissing her over and over again in a\r\nwarm, loving manner, she bade her good-bye, went a few steps, and\r\nthen once more came back to bid her keep up her heart.\r\n\r\nAnd when she had fairly left the house, Jane Wilson felt as if a\r\nsunbeam had ceased shining into the room.\r\n\r\nYet oh! how sorely Mary\'s heart ached; for more and more the fell\r\ncertainty came on her that her father was the murderer!  She\r\nstruggled hard not to dwell on this conviction; to think alone on\r\nthe means of proving Jem\'s innocence; that was her first duty, and\r\nthat should be done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII.   THE SUB-POENA.\r\n\r\n     "And must it then depend on this poor eye\r\n      And this unsteady hand, whether the bark,\r\n      That bears my all of treasured hope and love,\r\n      Shall find a passage through these frowning rocks\r\n      To some fair port where peace and safety smile,--\r\n      Or whether it shall blindly dash against them,\r\n      And miserably sink?  Heaven be my help;\r\n      And clear my eye and nerve my trembling hand!"\r\n                                 --"THE CONSTANT WOMAN."\r\n\r\nHer heart beating, her head full of ideas, which required time and\r\nsolitude to be reduced into order, Mary hurried home.  She was like\r\none who finds a jewel of which he cannot all at once ascertain the\r\nvalue, but who hides his treasure until some quiet hour when he may\r\nponder over the capabilities its possession unfolds.  She was like\r\none who discovers the silken clue which guides to some bower of\r\nbliss, and secure of the power within his grasp, has to wait for a\r\ntime before he may thread the labyrinth.\r\n\r\nBut no jewel, no bower of bliss was ever so precious to miser or\r\nlover as was the belief which now pervaded Mary\'s mind that Jem\'s\r\ninnocence might be proved, without involving any suspicion of that\r\nother--that dear one, so dear, although so criminal--on whose part\r\nin this cruel business she dared not dwell even in thought.  For if\r\nshe did there arose the awful question,--if all went against Jem the\r\ninnocent, if judge and jury gave the verdict forth which had the\r\nlooming gallows in the rear, what ought she to do, possessed of her\r\nterrible knowledge?  Surely not to inculpate her father--and yet--\r\nand yet--she almost prayed for the blessed unconsciousness of death\r\nor madness, rather than that awful question should have to be\r\nanswered by her.\r\n\r\nBut now a way seemed opening, opening yet more clear.  She was\r\nthankful she had thought of the alibi, and yet more thankful to have\r\nso easily obtained the clue to Jem\'s whereabouts that miserable\r\nnight.  The bright light that her new hope threw over all seemed\r\nalso to make her thankful for the early time appointed for the\r\ntrial.  It would be easy to catch Will Wilson on his return from the\r\nIsle of Man, which he had planned should be on the Monday; and on\r\nthe Tuesday all would be made clear--all that she dared to wish to\r\nbe made clear.\r\n\r\nShe had still to collect her thoughts and freshen her memory enough\r\nto arrange how to meet with Will--for to the chances of a letter she\r\nwould not trust; to find out his lodgings when in Liverpool; to try\r\nand remember the name of the ship in which he was to sail: and the\r\nmore she considered these points, the more difficulty she found\r\nthere would be in ascertaining these minor but important facts.  For\r\nyou are aware that Alice, whose memory was clear and strong on all\r\npoints in which her heart was interested, was lying in a manner\r\nsenseless: that Jane Wilson was (to use her own word, so\r\nexpressive to a Lancashire ear) "dazed"; that is to say, bewildered,\r\nlost in the confusion of terrifying and distressing thoughts;\r\nincapable of concentrating her mind; and at the best of times Will\'s\r\nproceedings were a matter of little importance to her (or so she\r\npretended), she was so jealous of aught which distracted attention\r\nfrom her pearl of price, her only son Jem.  So Mary felt hopeless of\r\nobtaining any intelligence of the sailor\'s arrangements from her.\r\n\r\nThen, should she apply to Jem himself?  No! she knew him too well.\r\nShe felt how thoroughly he must ere now have had it in his power to\r\nexculpate himself at another\'s expense.  And his tacit refusal so to\r\ndo, had assured her of what she had never doubted, that the murderer\r\nwas safe from any impeachment of his.  But then neither would he\r\nconsent, she feared, to any steps which might tend to prove himself\r\ninnocent.  At any rate, she could not consult him.  He was removed\r\nto Kirkdale, and time pressed.  Already it was Saturday at noon.\r\nAnd even if she could have gone to him, I believe she would not.\r\nShe longed to do all herself; to be his liberator, his deliverer; to\r\nwin him life, though she might never regain his lost love by her own\r\nexertions!  And oh! how could she see him to discuss a subject in\r\nwhich both knew who was the bloodstained man; and yet whose name\r\nmight not be breathed by either, so dearly with all his faults, his\r\nsins, was he loved by both.\r\n\r\nAll at once, when she had ceased to try and remember, the name of\r\nWill\'s ship flashed across her mind.  The John Cropper.\r\n\r\nHe had named it, she had been sure, all along.  He had named it in\r\nhis conversation with her that last, that fatal Thursday evening.\r\nShe repeated it over and over again, through a nervous dread of\r\nagain forgetting it.  The John Cropper.\r\n\r\nAnd then, as if she were rousing herself out of some strange stupor,\r\nshe bethought her of Margaret.  Who so likely as Margaret to\r\ntreasure every little particular respecting Will, now Alice was dead\r\nto all the stirring purposes of life?\r\n\r\nShe had gone thus far in her process of thought, when a neighbour\r\nstepped in; she with whom they had usually deposited the house-key,\r\nwhen both Mary and her father were absent from home, and who\r\nconsequently took upon herself to answer all inquiries, and receive\r\nall messages which any friends might make, or leave, on finding the\r\nhouse shut up.\r\n\r\n"Here\'s somewhat for you, Mary!  A policeman left it."\r\n\r\nA bit of parchment.\r\n\r\nMany people have a dread of those mysterious pieces of parchment.  I\r\nam one.  Mary was another.  Her heart misgave her as she took it,\r\nand looked at the unusual appearance of the writing, which, though\r\nlegible enough, conveyed no idea to her, or rather her mind shut\r\nitself up against receiving any idea, which after all was rather a\r\nproof she had some suspicion of the meaning that awaited her.\r\n\r\n"What is it?" asked she, in a voice from which all the pith and\r\nmarrow seemed extracted.\r\n\r\n"Nay! how should I know?  Policeman said he\'d call again towards\r\nevening, and see if you\'d getten it.  He were loth to leave it,\r\nthough I telled him who I was, and all about my keeping th\' key, and\r\ntaking messages."\r\n\r\n"What is it about?" asked Mary again, in the same hoarse, feeble\r\nvoice, and turning it over in her fingers, as if she dreaded to\r\ninform herself of its meaning.\r\n\r\n"Well! yo can read word of writing and I cannot, so it\'s queer I\r\nshould have to tell you.  But my master says it\'s a summons for yo\r\nto bear witness again Jem Wilson, at th\' trial at Liverpool Assize."\r\n\r\n"God pity me!" said Mary faintly, as white as a sheet.\r\n\r\n"Nay, wench, never take on so.  What yo can say will go little way\r\neither to help or to hinder, for folk say he\'s certain to be hung;\r\nand sure enough, it was t\'other one as was your sweetheart."\r\n\r\nMary was beyond any pang this speech would have given at another\r\ntime.  Her thoughts were all busy picturing to herself the terrible\r\noccasion of their next meeting--not as lovers meet should they meet!\r\n\r\n"Well!" said the neighbour, seeing no use in remaining with one who\r\nnoticed her words or her presence so little, "thou\'lt tell policeman\r\nthou\'st getten his precious bit of paper.  He seemed to think I\r\nshould be keeping it for mysel; he\'s the first as has ever\r\nmisdoubted me about giving messages, or notes.  Good-day."\r\n\r\nShe left the house, but Mary did not know it.  She sat still with\r\nthe parchment in her hand.\r\n\r\nAll at once she started up.  She would take it to Job Legh and ask\r\nhim to tell her the true meaning, for it could not be THAT.\r\n\r\nSo she went, and choked out her words of inquiry.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a sub-poena," he replied, turning the parchment over with the\r\nair of a connoisseur; for Job loved hard words, and lawyer-like\r\nforms, and even esteemed himself slightly qualified for a lawyer,\r\nfrom the smattering of knowledge he had picked up from an odd volume\r\nof Blackstone that he had once purchased at a bookstall.\r\n\r\n"A sub-poena--what is that?" gasped Mary, still in suspense.\r\n\r\nJob was struck with her voice, her changed miserable voice, and\r\npeered at her countenance from over his spectacles.\r\n\r\n"A sub-poena is neither more nor less than this, my dear.  It\'s a\r\nsummonsing you to attend, and answer such questions as may be asked\r\nof you regarding the trial of James Wilson, for the murder of Henry\r\nCarson; that\'s the long and short of it, only more elegantly put,\r\nfor the benefit of them who knows how to value the gift of language.\r\nI\'ve been a witness beforetime myself; there\'s nothing much to be\r\nafeard on; if they are impudent, why, just you be impudent, and give\r\n\'em tit for tat."\r\n\r\n"Nothing much to be afeard on!" echoed Mary, but in such a different\r\ntone.\r\n\r\n"Ay, poor wench, I see how it is.  It\'ll go hard with thee a bit, I\r\ndare say; but keep up thy heart.  Yo cannot have much to tell \'em,\r\nthat can go either one way or th\' other.  Nay! maybe thou may do him\r\na bit o\' good, for when they set eyes on thee, they\'ll see fast\r\nenough how he came to be so led away by jealousy; for thou\'rt a\r\npretty creature, Mary, and one look at thy face will let \'em into\r\nth\' secret of a young man\'s madness, and make \'em more ready to pass\r\nit over."\r\n\r\n"O Job, and won\'t you ever believe me when I tell you he\'s innocent?\r\nIndeed, and indeed I can prove it; he was with Will all that night;\r\nhe was, indeed, Job!"\r\n\r\n"My wench! whose word hast thou for that?" said Job pityingly.\r\n\r\n"Why! his mother told me, and I\'ll get Will to bear witness to it.\r\nBut, oh! Job" (bursting into tears), "it is hard if you won\'t\r\nbelieve me.  How shall I clear him to strangers, when those who know\r\nhim, and ought to love him, are so set against his being innocent?"\r\n\r\n"God knows, I\'m not against his being innocent," said Job solemnly.\r\n"I\'d give half my remaining days on earth--I\'d give them all, Mary\r\n(and but for the love I bear to my poor blind girl, they\'d be no\r\ngreat gift), if I could save him.  You\'ve thought me hard, Mary, but\r\nI\'m not hard at bottom, and I\'ll help you if I can; that I will,\r\nright or wrong," he added; but in a low voice, and coughed the\r\nuncertain words away the moment afterwards.\r\n\r\n"O Job! if you will help me," exclaimed Mary, brightening up (though\r\nit was but a wintry gleam after all), "tell me what to say, when\r\nthey question me; I shall be so gloppened,* I shan\'t know what to\r\nanswer."\r\n\r\n     *Gloppened; terrified.\r\n\r\n"Thou canst do nought better than tell the truth.  Truth\'s best at\r\nall times, they say; and for sure it is when folk have to do with\r\nlawyers; for they\'re \'cute and cunning enough to get it out sooner\r\nor later, and it makes folk look like Tom Noddies, when truth\r\nfollows falsehood, against their will."\r\n\r\n"But I don\'t know the truth; I mean--I can\'t say rightly what I\r\nmean; but I\'m sure, if I were pent up, and stared at by hundreds of\r\nfolk, and asked ever so simple a question, I should be for answering\r\nit wrong; if they asked me if I had seen you on a Saturday, or a\r\nTuesday, or any day, I should have clean forgotten all about it, and\r\nsay the very thing I should not."\r\n\r\n"Well, well, don\'t go for to get such notions into your head;\r\nthey\'re what they call \'narvous,\' and talking on \'em does no good.\r\nHere\'s Margaret! bless the wench!  Look, Mary, how well she guides\r\nhersel."\r\n\r\nJob fell to watching his grand-daughter, as with balancing, measured\r\nsteps, timed almost as if to music, she made her way across the\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\nMary shrank as if from a cold blast--shrank from Margaret!  The\r\nblind girl, with her reserve, her silence, seemed to be a severe\r\njudge; she, listening, would be such a check to the trusting\r\nearnestness of confidence, which was beginning to unlock the\r\nsympathy of Job.  Mary knew herself to blame; felt her errors in\r\nevery fibre of her heart; but yet she would rather have had them\r\nspoken about, even in terms of severest censure, than have been\r\ntreated in the icy manner in which Margaret had received her that\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\n"Here\'s Mary," said Job, almost as if he wished to propitiate his\r\ngrand-daughter, "come to take a bit of dinner with us, for I\'ll\r\nwarrant she\'s never thought of cooking any for herself to-day; and\r\nshe looks as wan and pale as a ghost."\r\n\r\nIt was calling out the feeling of hospitality, so strong and warm in\r\nmost of those who have little to offer, but whose heart goes eagerly\r\nand kindly with that little.  Margaret came towards Mary with a\r\nwelcoming gesture, and a kinder manner by far than she had used in\r\nthe morning.\r\n\r\n"Nay, Mary, thou know\'st thou\'st getten naught at home," urged Job.\r\n\r\nAnd Mary, faint and weary, and with a heart too aching-full of other\r\nmatters to be pertinacious in this, withdrew her refusal.\r\n\r\nThey ate their dinner quietly; for to all it was an effort to speak:\r\nand after one or two attempts they had subsided into silence.\r\n\r\nWhen the meal was ended Job began again on the subject they all had\r\nat heart.\r\n\r\n"Yon poor lad at Kirkdale will want a lawyer to see they don\'t put\r\non him, but do him justice.  Hast thought of that?"\r\n\r\nMary had not, and felt sure his mother had not.\r\n\r\nMargaret confirmed this last supposition.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve but just been there, and poor Jane is like one dateless; so\r\nmany griefs come on her at once.  One time she seems to make sure\r\nhe\'ll be hung; and if I took her in that way, she flew out (poor\r\nbody!) and said that in spite of what folks said, there were them as\r\ncould, and would prove him guiltless.  So I never knew where to have\r\nher.  The only thing she was constant in, was declaring him\r\ninnocent."\r\n\r\n"Mother-like!" said Job.\r\n\r\n"She meant Will, when she spoke of them that could prove him\r\ninnocent.  He was with Will on Thursday night, walking a part of the\r\nway with him to Liverpool; now the thing is to lay hold on Will and\r\nget him to prove this."  So spoke Mary, calm, from the earnestness\r\nof her purpose.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t build too much on it, my dear," said Job.\r\n\r\n"I do build on it," replied Mary, "because I know it\'s the truth,\r\nand I mean to try and prove it, come what may.  Nothing you can say\r\nwill daunt me, Job, so don\'t you go and try.  You may help, but you\r\ncannot hinder me doing what I\'m resolved on."\r\n\r\nThey respected her firmness of determination, and Job almost gave in\r\nto her belief, when he saw how steadfastly she was acting upon it.\r\nOh! surest way of conversion to our faith, whatever it may be--\r\nregarding either small things, or great--when it is beheld as the\r\nactuating principle, from which we never swerve!  When it is seen\r\nthat, instead of overmuch profession, it is worked into the life,\r\nand moves every action!\r\n\r\nMary gained courage as she instinctively felt she had made way with\r\none at least of her companions.\r\n\r\n"Now I\'m clear about this much," she continued, "he was with Will\r\nwhen the--shot was fired."--(she could not bring herself to say,\r\nwhen the murder was committed, when she remembered WHO it was that,\r\nshe had every reason to believe, was the taker-away of life)--"Will\r\ncan prove this: I must find Will.  He wasn\'t to sail till Tuesday.\r\nThere\'s time enough.  He was to come back from his uncle\'s, in the\r\nIsle of Man, on Monday.  I must meet him in Liverpool, on that day,\r\nand tell him what has happened, and how poor Jem is in trouble, and\r\nthat he must prove an alibi, come Tuesday.  All this I can and will\r\ndo, though perhaps I don\'t clearly know how, just at present.  But\r\nsurely God will help me.  When I know I\'m doing right, I will have\r\nno fear, but put my trust in Him; for I\'m acting for the innocent\r\nand good, and not for my own self, who have done so wrong.  I have\r\nno fear when I think of Jem, who is so good."\r\n\r\nShe stopped, oppressed with the fulness of her heart.  Margaret\r\nbegan to love her again; to see in her the same sweet, faulty,\r\nimpulsive, lovable creature she had known in the former Mary Barton,\r\nbut with more of dignity, self-reliance, and purpose.\r\n\r\nMary spoke again.\r\n\r\n"Now I know the name of Will\'s vessel--the John Cropper; and I know\r\nthat she is bound to America.  That is something to know.  But I\r\nforgot, if I ever heard, where he lodges in Liverpool.  He spoke of\r\nhis landlady, as a good, trustworthy woman; but if he named her\r\nname, it has slipped my memory.  Can you help me, Margaret?"\r\n\r\nShe appealed to her friend calmly and openly, as if perfectly aware\r\nof, and recognising the unspoken tie which bound her and Will\r\ntogether; she asked her in the same manner in which she would have\r\nasked a wife where her husband dwelt.  And Margaret replied in the\r\nlike calm tone, two spots of crimson on her cheeks alone bearing\r\nwitness to any internal agitation.\r\n\r\n"He lodges at a Mrs. Jones\', Milk-House Yard, out of Nicholas\r\nStreet.  He has lodged there ever since he began to go to sea; she\r\nis a very decent kind of woman, I believe."\r\n\r\n"Well, Mary!  I\'ll give you my prayers" said Job.  "It\'s not often I\r\npray regular, though I often speak a word to God, when I\'m either\r\nvery happy or very sorry; I\'ve catched myself thanking Him at odd\r\nhours when I\'ve found a rare insect, or had a fine day for an out;\r\nbut I cannot help it, no more than I can talking to a friend.  But\r\nthis time I\'ll pray regular for Jem, and for you.  And so will\r\nMargaret, I\'ll be bound.  Still, wench! what think yo of a lawyer?\r\nI know one, Mr. Cheshire, who\'s rather given to th\' insect line--and\r\na good kind o\' chap.  He and I have swopped specimens many\'s the\r\ntime, when either of us had a duplicate.  He\'ll do me a kind turn\r\nI\'m sure.  I\'ll just take my hat, and pay him a visit."\r\n\r\nNo sooner said, than done.\r\n\r\nMargaret and Mary were left alone.  And this seemed to bring back\r\nthe feeling of awkwardness, not to say estrangement.\r\n\r\nBut Mary, excited to an unusual pitch of courage, was the first to\r\nbreak silence.\r\n\r\n"O Margaret!" said she, "I see--I feel how wrong you think I have\r\nacted; you cannot think me worse than I think myself, now my eyes\r\nare opened."  Here her sobs came choking up her voice.\r\n\r\n"Nay," Margaret began, "I have no right to"--\r\n\r\n"Yes, Margaret, you have a right to judge; you cannot help it; only\r\nin your judgment remember mercy, as the Bible says.  You, who have\r\nbeen always good, cannot tell how easy it is at first to go a little\r\nwrong, and then how hard it is to go back.  Oh! I little thought\r\nwhen I was first pleased with Mr. Carson\'s speeches, how it would\r\nall end; perhaps in the death of him I love better than life."\r\n\r\nShe burst into a passion of tears.  The feelings pent up through the\r\nday would have vent.  But checking herself with a strong effort, and\r\nlooking up at Margaret as piteously as if those calm, stony eyes\r\ncould see her imploring face, she added--\r\n\r\n"I must not cry; I must not give way; there will be time enough for\r\nthat hereafter, if--I only wanted you to speak kindly to me,\r\nMargaret, for I am very, very wretched; more wretched than any one\r\ncan ever know; more wretched, I sometimes fancy, than I have\r\ndeserved--but that\'s wrong, isn\'t it, Margaret?  Oh! I have done\r\nwrong, and I am punished: you cannot tell how much."\r\n\r\nWho could resist her voice, her tones of misery, of humility?  Who\r\nwould refuse the kindness for which she begged so penitently?  Not\r\nMargaret.  The old friendly manner came back.  With it, maybe, more\r\nof tenderness.\r\n\r\n"Oh! Margaret, do you think he can be saved; do you think they can\r\nfind him guilty, if Will comes forward as a witness?  Won\'t that be\r\na good alibi?"\r\n\r\nMargaret did not answer for a moment.\r\n\r\n"Oh, speak! Margaret," said Mary, with anxious impatience.\r\n\r\n"I know nought about law, or alibis," replied Margaret meekly; "but,\r\nMary, as grandfather says, aren\'t you building too much on what Jane\r\nWilson has told you about his going with Will?  Poor soul, she\'s\r\ngone dateless, I think, with care, and watching, and overmuch\r\ntrouble; and who can wonder?  Or Jem may have told her he was going,\r\nby way of a blind."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t know Jem," said Mary, starting from her seat in a hurried\r\nmanner, "or you would not say so."\r\n\r\n"I hope I may be wrong! but think, Mary, how much there is against\r\nhim.  The shot was fired with his gun; he it was as threatened Mr.\r\nCarson not many days before; he was absent from home at that very\r\ntime, as we know, and, as I\'m much afeard, some one will be called\r\non to prove; and there\'s no one else to share suspicion with him."\r\n\r\nMary heaved a deep sigh.\r\n\r\n"But, Margaret, he did not do it," Mary again asserted.\r\n\r\nMargaret looked unconvinced.\r\n\r\n"I can do no good, I see, by saying so, for none on you believe me,\r\nand I won\'t say so again till I can prove it.  Monday morning I\'ll\r\ngo to Liverpool.  I shall be at hand for the trial.  O dear! dear!\r\nAnd I will find Will; and then, Margaret, I think you\'ll be sorry\r\nfor being so stubborn about Jem."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t fly off, dear Mary; I\'d give a deal to be wrong.  And now I\'m\r\ngoing to be plain spoken.  You\'ll want money.  Them lawyers is no\r\nbetter than a sponge for sucking up money; let alone your hunting\r\nout Will, and your keep in Liverpool, and what not.  You must take\r\nsome of the mint I\'ve got laid by in the old tea-pot.  You have no\r\nright to refuse, for I offer it to Jem, not to you; it\'s for his\r\npurposes you\'re to use it."\r\n\r\n"I know--I see.  Thank you, Margaret; you\'re a kind one at any rate.\r\nI take it for Jem; and I\'ll do my very best with it for him.  Not\r\nall, though; don\'t think I\'ll take all.  They\'ll pay me for my keep.\r\nI\'ll take this," accepting a sovereign from the hoard which Margaret\r\nproduced out of its accustomed place in the cupboard.  "Your\r\ngrandfather will pay the lawyer, I\'ll have nought to do with him,"\r\nshuddering as she remembered Job\'s words, about lawyers\' skill in\r\nalways discovering the truth, sooner or later; and knowing what was\r\nthe secret she had to hide.\r\n\r\n"Bless you! don\'t make such ado about it," said Margaret, cutting\r\nshort Mary\'s thanks.  "I sometimes think there\'s two sides to the\r\ncommandment; and that we may say, \'Let others do unto you, as you\r\nwould do unto them,\' for pride often prevents our giving others a\r\ngreat deal of pleasure, in not letting them be kind, when their\r\nhearts are longing to help; and when we ourselves should wish to do\r\njust the same, if we were in their place.  Oh! how often I\'ve been\r\nhurt, by being coldly told by persons not to trouble myself about\r\ntheir care, or sorrow, when I saw them in great grief, and wanted to\r\nbe of comfort.  Our Lord Jesus was not above letting folk minister\r\nto Him, for He knew how happy it makes one to do aught for another.\r\nIt\'s the happiest work on earth."\r\n\r\nMary had been too much engrossed by watching what was passing in the\r\nstreet to attend very closely to that which Margaret was saying.\r\nFrom her seat she could see out of the window pretty plainly, and\r\nshe caught sight of a gentleman walking alongside of Job, evidently\r\nin earnest conversation with him, and looking keen and penetrating\r\nenough to be a lawyer.  Job was laying down something to be attended\r\nto she could see, by his uplifted forefinger, and his whole gesture;\r\nthen he pointed and nodded across the street to his own house, as if\r\ninducing his companion to come in.  Mary dreaded lest he should, and\r\nshe be subjected to a closer cross-examination than she had hitherto\r\nundergone, as to why she was so certain that Jem was innocent.  She\r\nfeared he was coming; he stepped a little towards the spot.  No! it\r\nwas only to make way for a child, tottering along, whom Mary had\r\noverlooked.  Now Job took him by the button, so earnestly familiar\r\nhad he grown.  The gentleman looked "fidging fain" to be gone, but\r\nsubmitted in a manner that made Mary like him in spite of his\r\nprofession.  Then came a volley of last words, answered by briefest\r\nnods, and monosyllables; and then the stranger went off with\r\nredoubled quickness of pace, and Job crossed the street with a\r\nlittle satisfied air of importance on his kindly face.\r\n\r\n"Well! Mary," said he on entering, "I\'ve seen the lawyer, not Mr.\r\nCheshire though; trials for murder, it seems, are not his line o\'\r\nbusiness.  But he gived me a note to another \'torney; a fine fellow\r\nenough, only too much of a talker!  I could hardly get a word in, he\r\ncut me so short.  However, I\'ve just been going over the principal\r\npoints again to him; maybe you saw us!  I wanted him just to come\r\nover and speak to you himsel, Mary, but he was pressed for time; and\r\nhe said your evidence would not be much either here or there.  He\'s\r\ngoing to the \'sizes first train on Monday morning, and will see Jem,\r\nand hear the ins and outs from him, and he\'s gived me his address,\r\nMary, and you and Will are to call on him (Will \'special) on Monday\r\nat two o\'clock.  Thou\'rt taking it in, Mary; thou\'rt to call on him\r\nin Liverpool at two, Monday afternoon?"\r\n\r\nJob had reason to doubt if she fully understood him; for all this\r\nminuteness of detail, these satisfactory arrangements, as he\r\nconsidered them, only seemed to bring the circumstances in which she\r\nwas placed more vividly home to Mary.  They convinced her that it\r\nwas real, and not all a dream, as she had sunk into fancying it for\r\na few minutes, while sitting in the old accustomed place, her body\r\nenjoying the rest, and her frame sustained by food, and listening to\r\nMargaret\'s calm voice.  The gentleman she had just beheld would see\r\nand question Jem in a few hours, and what would be the result?\r\n\r\nMonday: that was the day after to-morrow, and on Tuesday, life and\r\ndeath would be tremendous realities to her lover; or else death\r\nwould be an awful certainty to her father.\r\n\r\nNo wonder Job went over his main points again--\r\n\r\n"Monday; at two o\'clock, mind; and here\'s his card.  \'Mr.\r\nBridgnorth, 41, Renshaw Street, Liverpool.\'  He\'ll be lodging\r\nthere."\r\n\r\nJob ceased talking, and the silence roused Mary up to thank him.\r\n\r\n"You\'re very kind, Job; very.  You and Margaret won\'t desert me,\r\ncome what will."\r\n\r\n"Pooh! pooh! wench; don\'t lose heart, just as I\'m beginning to get\r\nit.  He seems to think a deal on Will\'s evidence.  You\'re sure,\r\ngirls, you\'re under no mistake about Will?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure," said Mary, "he went straight from here, purposing to go\r\nto see his uncle at the Isle of Man, and be back Sunday night, ready\r\nfor the ship sailing on Tuesday."\r\n\r\n"So am I," said Margaret.  "And the ship\'s name was the John\r\nCropper, and he lodged where I told Mary before.  Have you got it\r\ndown, Mary?"  Mary wrote it on the back of Mr. Bridgnorth\'s card.\r\n\r\n"He was not over-willing to go," said she as she wrote, "for he knew\r\nlittle about his uncle, and said he didn\'t care if he never know\'d\r\nmore.  But he said kinsfolk was kinsfolk, and promises was promises,\r\nso he\'d go for a day or so, and then it would be over."\r\n\r\nMargaret had to go and practise some singing in town; so, though\r\nloth to depart and be alone, Mary bade her friends good-bye.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV.   WITH THE DYING.\r\n\r\n     "Oh, sad and solemn is the trembling watch\r\n      Of those who sit and count the heavy hours\r\n      Beside the fevered sleep of one they love!\r\n      Oh, awful is it in the hushed midnight,\r\n      While gazing on the pallid moveless form,\r\n      To start and ask, \'Is it now sleep or death?\'"\r\n                                         --ANONYMOUS.\r\n\r\nMary could not be patient in her loneliness; so much painful thought\r\nweighed on her mind; the very house was haunted with memories and\r\nforeshadowings.\r\n\r\nHaving performed all duties to Jem, as far as her weak powers, yet\r\nloving heart could act; and a black veil being drawn over her\r\nfather\'s past, present, and future life, beyond which she could not\r\npenetrate to judge of any filial service she ought to render: her\r\nmind unconsciously sought after some course of action in which she\r\nmight engage.  Anything, anything, rather than leisure for\r\nreflection.\r\n\r\nAnd then came up the old feeling which first bound Ruth to Naomi;\r\nthe love they both held towards one object; and Mary felt that her\r\ncares would be most lightened by being of use, or of comfort to his\r\nmother.  So she once more locked up the house, and set off towards\r\nAncoats; rushing along with downcast head, for fear lest anyone\r\nshould recognise her and arrest her progress.\r\n\r\nJane Wilson sat quietly in her chair as Mary entered; so quietly, as\r\nto strike one by the contrast it presented to her usual bustling and\r\nnervous manner.\r\n\r\nShe looked very pale and wan: but the quietness was the thing that\r\nstruck Mary most.  She did not rise as Mary came in, but sat still\r\nand said something in so gentle, so feeble a voice, that Mary did\r\nnot catch it.\r\n\r\nMrs. Davenport, who was there, plucked Mary by the gown, and\r\nwhispered, "Never heed her; she\'s worn out, and best let alone.\r\nI\'ll tell you all about it, upstairs."\r\n\r\nBut Mary, touched by the anxious look with which Mrs. Wilson gazed\r\nat her, as if waiting the answer to some question, went forward to\r\nlisten to the speech she was again repeating.\r\n\r\n"What is this?  Will you tell me?"\r\n\r\nThen Mary looked and saw another ominous slip of parchment in the\r\nmother\'s hand, which she was rolling up and down in a tremulous\r\nmanner between her fingers.\r\n\r\nMary\'s heart sickened within her, and she could not speak.\r\n\r\n"What is it?" she repeated.  "Will you tell me?"  She still looked\r\nat Mary, with the same child-like gaze of wonder and patient\r\nentreaty.\r\n\r\nWhat could she answer?\r\n\r\n"I telled ye not to heed her," said Mrs. Davenport, a little\r\nangrily.  "She knows well enough what it is--too well, belike.  I\r\nwas not in when they sarved it; but Mrs. Heming (her as lives next\r\ndoor) was, and she spelled out the meaning, and made it all clear to\r\nMrs. Wilson.  It\'s a summons to be a witness on Jem\'s trial--Mrs.\r\nHeming thinks to swear to the gun; for yo see, there\'s nobbut* her\r\nas can testify to its being his, and she let on so easily to the\r\npoliceman that it was his, that there\'s no getting off her word now.\r\nPoor body; she takes it very hard, I dare say!"\r\n\r\n     *Nobbut; none-but.  "No man sigh evere God NO BUT the oon\r\n      bigetun sone."--Wickliffe\'s Version.\r\n\r\nMrs. Wilson had waited patiently while this whispered speech was\r\nbeing uttered, imagining, perhaps, that it would end in some\r\nexplanation addressed to her.  But when both were silent, though\r\ntheir eyes, without speech or language, told their hearts\' pity, she\r\nspoke again in the same unaltered gentle voice (so different from\r\nthe irritable impatience she had been ever apt to show to everyone\r\nexcept her husband--he who had wedded her, broken-down and\r\ninjured),--in a voice so different, I say, from the old, hasty\r\nmanner, she spoke now the same anxious words--\r\n\r\n"What is this?  Will you tell me?"\r\n\r\n"Yo\'d better give it me at once, Mrs. Wilson, and let me put it out\r\nof your sight.  Speak to her, Mary, wench, and ask for a sight on\r\nit; I\'ve tried and better-tried to get it from her, and she takes no\r\nheed of words, and I\'m loth to pull it by force out of her hands."\r\n\r\nMary drew the little "cricket"* out from under the dresser, and sat\r\ndown at Mrs. Wilson\'s knee, and, coaxing one of her tremulous\r\never-moving hands into hers, began to rub it soothingly; there was a\r\nlittle resistance--a very little, but that was all; and presently,\r\nin the nervous movement of the imprisoned hand, the parchment fell\r\nto the ground.\r\n\r\n     *Cricket; a stool.\r\n\r\nMary calmly and openly picked it up, without any attempt at\r\nconcealment, and quietly placing it in sight of the anxious eyes\r\nthat followed it with a kind of spell-bound dread, went on with her\r\nsoothing caresses.\r\n\r\n"She has had no sleep for many nights," said the girl to Mrs.\r\nDavenport, "and all this woe and sorrow,--it\'s no wonder."\r\n\r\n"No, indeed!" Mrs. Davenport answered.\r\n\r\n"We must get her fairly to bed; we must get her undressed, and all;\r\nand trust to God in His mercy to send her to sleep, or else"--\r\n\r\nFor, you see, they spoke before her as if she were not there; her\r\nheart was so far away.\r\n\r\nAccordingly they almost lifted her from the chair, in which she sat\r\nmotionless, and taking her up as gently as a mother carries her\r\nsleeping baby, they undressed her poor, worn form, and laid her in\r\nthe little bed upstairs.  They had once thought of placing her in\r\nJem\'s bed, to be out of sight or sound of any disturbance of\r\nAlice\'s; but then again they remembered the shock she might receive\r\nin awakening in so unusual a place, and also that Mary, who intended\r\nto keep vigil that night in the house of mourning, would find it\r\ndifficult to divide her attention in the possible cases that might\r\nensue.\r\n\r\nSo they laid her, as I said before, on that little pallet bed; and,\r\nas they were slowly withdrawing from the bedside, hoping and praying\r\nthat she might sleep, and forget for a time her heavy burden, she\r\nlooked wistfully after Mary, and whispered--\r\n\r\n"You haven\'t told me what it is.  What is it?"\r\n\r\nAnd gazing in her face for the expected answer, her eyelids slowly\r\nclosed, and she fell into a deep, heavy sleep, almost as profound a\r\nrest as death.\r\n\r\nMrs. Davenport went her way, and Mary was alone,--for I cannot call\r\nthose who sleep allies against the agony of thought which solitude\r\nsometimes brings up.\r\n\r\nShe dreaded the night before her.  Alice might die; the doctor had\r\nthat day declared her case hopeless, and not far from death; and at\r\ntimes, the terror so natural to the young, not of death, but of the\r\nremains of the dead, came over Mary; and she bent and listened\r\nanxiously for the long-drawn, pausing breath of the sleeping Alice.\r\n\r\nOr Mrs. Wilson might awake in a state which Mary dreaded to\r\nanticipate, and anticipated while she dreaded;--in a state of\r\ncomplete delirium.  Already her senses had been severely stunned by\r\nthe full explanation of what was required of her--of what she had to\r\nprove against her son, her Jem, her only child--which Mary could not\r\ndoubt the officious Mrs. Heming had given; and what if in dreams\r\n(that land into which no sympathy or love can penetrate with\r\nanother, either to share its bliss or its agony--that land whose\r\nscenes are unspeakable terrors, are hidden mysteries, are priceless\r\ntreasures to one alone--that land where alone I may see, while yet I\r\ntarry here, the sweet looks of my dear child)--what if, in the\r\nhorrors of her dreams, her brain should go still more astray, and\r\nshe should waken crazy with her visions, and the terrible reality\r\nthat begot them?\r\n\r\nHow much worse is anticipation sometimes than reality!  How Mary\r\ndreaded that night, and how calmly it passed by!  Even more so than\r\nif Mary had not had such claims upon her care!\r\n\r\nAnxiety about them deadened her own peculiar anxieties.  She thought\r\nof the sleepers whom she was watching, till, overpowered herself by\r\nthe want of rest, she fell off into short slumbers in which the\r\nnight wore imperceptibly away.  To be sure, Alice spoke, and sang\r\nduring her waking moments, like the child she deemed herself; but so\r\nhappily with the dearly-loved ones around her, with the scent of the\r\nheather, and the song of the wild bird hovering about her in\r\nimagination--with old scraps of ballads, or old snatches of\r\nprimitive versions of the Psalms (such as are sung in country\r\nchurches half draperied over with ivy, and where the running brook,\r\nor the murmuring wind among the trees makes fit accompaniment to the\r\nchorus of human voices uttering praise and thanksgiving to their\r\nGod)--that the speech and the song gave comfort and good cheer to\r\nthe listener\'s heart, and the grey dawn began to dim the light of\r\nthe rush-candle, before Mary thought it possible that day was\r\nalready trembling in the horizon.\r\n\r\nThen she got up from the chair where she had been dozing, and went,\r\nhalf-asleep, to the window to assure herself that morning was at\r\nhand.  The streets were unusually quiet with a Sabbath stillness.\r\nNo factory bells that morning; no early workmen going to their\r\nlabours; no slip-shod girls cleaning the windows of the little shops\r\nwhich broke the monotony of the street; instead, you might see here\r\nand there some operative sallying forth for a breath of country air,\r\nor some father leading out his wee toddling bairns for the unwonted\r\npleasure of a walk with "Daddy," in the clear frosty morning.  Men\r\nwith more leisure on week-days would perhaps have walked quicker\r\nthan they did through the fresh sharp air of this Sunday morning;\r\nbut to them there was a pleasure, an absolute refreshment in the\r\ndawdling gait they, one and all of them, had.\r\n\r\nThere were, indeed, one or two passengers on that morning whose\r\nobjects were less innocent and less praiseworthy than those of the\r\npeople I have already mentioned, and whose animal state of mind and\r\nbody clashed jarringly on the peacefulness of the day, but upon them\r\nI will not dwell; as you and I, and almost every one, I think, may\r\nsend up our individual cry of self-reproach that we have not done\r\nall that we could for the stray and wandering ones of our brethren.\r\n\r\nWhen Mary turned from the window, she went to the bed of each\r\nsleeper, to look and listen.  Alice looked perfectly quiet and happy\r\nin her slumber, and her face seemed to have become much more\r\nyouthful during the painless approach to death.\r\n\r\nMrs. Wilson\'s countenance was stamped with the anxiety of the last\r\nfew days, although she, too, appeared sleeping soundly; but as Mary\r\ngazed on her, trying to trace a likeness to her son in her face, she\r\nawoke and looked up into Mary\'s eyes, while the expression of\r\nconsciousness came back into her own.\r\n\r\nBoth were silent for a minute or two.  Mary\'s eyes had fallen\r\nbeneath that penetrating gaze, in which the agony of memory seemed\r\nevery minute to find fuller vent.\r\n\r\n"Is it a dream?" the mother asked at last in a low voice.\r\n\r\n"No!" replied Mary, in the same tone.\r\n\r\nMrs. Wilson hid her face in the pillow.\r\n\r\nShe was fully conscious of everything this morning; it was evident\r\nthat the stunning effect of the sub-poena, which had affected her so\r\nmuch last night in her weak, worn-out state, had passed away.  Mary\r\noffered no opposition when she indicated by languid gesture and\r\naction that she wished to rise.  A sleepless bed is a haunted place.\r\n\r\nWhen she was dressed with Mary\'s aid, she stood by Alice for a\r\nminute or two looking at the slumberer.\r\n\r\n"How happy she is!" said she, quietly and sadly.\r\n\r\nAll the time that Mary was getting breakfast ready, and performing\r\nevery other little domestic office she could think of, to add to the\r\ncomfort of Jem\'s mother, Mrs. Wilson sat still in the arm-chair,\r\nwatching her silently.  Her old irritation of temper and manner\r\nseemed to have suddenly disappeared, or perhaps she was too\r\ndepressed in body and mind to show it.\r\n\r\nMary told her all that had been done with regard to Mr. Bridgnorth;\r\nall her own plans for seeking out Will; all her hopes; and concealed\r\nas well as she could all the doubts and fears that would arise\r\nunbidden.\r\n\r\nTo this Mrs. Wilson listened without much remark, but with deep\r\ninterest and perfect comprehension.  When Mary ceased, she sighed,\r\nand said, "O wench!  I am his mother, and yet I do so little, I can\r\ndo so little!  That\'s what frets me!  I seem like a child as sees\r\nits mammy ill, and moans and cries its little heart out, yet does\r\nnought to help.  I think my sense has left me all at once, and I\r\ncan\'t even find strength to cry like the little child."\r\n\r\nHereupon she broke into a feeble wail of self-reproach, that her\r\noutward show of misery was not greater; as if any cries, or tears,\r\nor loud-spoken words could have told of such pangs at the heart as\r\nthat look, and that thin, piping, altered voice!\r\n\r\nBut think of Mary and what she was enduring.  Picture to yourself\r\n(for I cannot tell you) the armies of thoughts that met and clashed\r\nin her brain; and then imagine the effort it cost her to be calm,\r\nand quiet, and even in a faint way, cheerful and smiling at times.\r\n\r\nAfter a while she began to stir about in her own mind for some means\r\nof sparing the poor mother the trial of appearing as a witness in\r\nthe matter of the gun.  She had made no allusion to her summons this\r\nmorning, and Mary almost thought she must have forgotten it; and\r\nsurely some means might be found to prevent that additional sorrow.\r\nShe must see Job about it; nay, if necessary, she must see Mr.\r\nBridgnorth, with all his truth-compelling powers; for, indeed, she\r\nhad so struggled and triumphed (though a sadly-bleeding victor at\r\nheart) over herself these two last days, had so concealed agony, and\r\nhidden her inward woe and bewilderment, that she began to take\r\nconfidence, and to have faith in her own powers of meeting any one\r\nwith a passably fair show, whatever might be rending her life\r\nbeneath the cloak of her deception.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, as soon as Mrs. Davenport came in after morning church,\r\nto ask after the two lone women, and she had heard the report Mary\r\nhad to give (so much better as regarded Mrs. Wilson than what they\r\nhad feared the night before it would have been)--as soon as this\r\nkind-hearted, grateful woman came in, Mary, telling her purpose,\r\nwent off to fetch the doctor who attended Alice.\r\n\r\nHe was shaking himself after his morning\'s round, and happy in the\r\nanticipation of his Sunday\'s dinner; but he was a good-tempered man,\r\nwho found it difficult to keep down his jovial easiness even by the\r\nbed of sickness or death.  He had mischosen his profession; for it\r\nwas his delight to see every one around him in full enjoyment of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nHowever, he subdued his face to the proper expression of sympathy,\r\nbefitting a doctor listening to a patient, or a patient\'s friend\r\n(and Mary\'s sad, pale, anxious face might be taken for either the\r\none or the other).\r\n\r\n"Well my girl! and what brings you here?" said he, as he entered his\r\nsurgery.  "Not on your own account, I hope."\r\n\r\n"I wanted you to come and see Alice Wilson,--and then I thought you\r\nwould maybe take a look at Mrs. Wilson."\r\n\r\nHe bustled on his hat and coat, and followed Mary instantly.\r\n\r\nAfter shaking his head over Alice (as if it was a mournful thing for\r\none so pure and good, so true, although so humble a Christian, to be\r\nnearing her desired haven), and muttering the accustomed words\r\nintended to destroy hope, and prepare anticipation, he went, in\r\ncompliance with Mary\'s look, to ask the usual questions of Mrs.\r\nWilson, who sat passively in her arm-chair.\r\n\r\nShe answered his questions, and submitted to his examination.\r\n\r\n"How do you think her?" asked Mary eagerly.\r\n\r\n"Why--a," began he, perceiving that he was desired to take one side\r\nin his answer, and unable to find out whether his listener was\r\nanxious for a favourable verdict or otherwise; but thinking it most\r\nprobable that she would desire the former, he continued--\r\n\r\n"She is weak, certainly; the natural result of such a shock as the\r\narrest of her son would be,--for I understand this James Wilson, who\r\nmurdered Mr. Carson, was her son.  Sad thing to have such a\r\nreprobate in the family."\r\n\r\n"You say \'WHO MURDERED,\' sir!" said Mary indignantly.  "He is only\r\ntaken up on suspicion, and many have no doubt of his innocence--\r\nthose who know him, sir."\r\n\r\n"Ah! well, well! doctors have seldom time to read newspapers, and I\r\ndare say I\'m not very correct in my story.  I dare say he\'s\r\ninnocent; I\'m sure I had no right to say otherwise,--only words slip\r\nout.--No! indeed, young woman, I see no cause for apprehension about\r\nthis poor creature in the next room;--weak--certainly; but a day or\r\ntwo\'s good nursing will set her up, and I\'m sure you\'re a good\r\nnurse, my dear, from your pretty kind-hearted face,--I\'ll send a\r\ncouple of pills and a draught, but don\'t alarm yourself--there\'s no\r\noccasion, I assure you."\r\n\r\n"But you don\'t think her fit to go to Liverpool?" asked Mary, still\r\nin the anxious tone of one who wishes earnestly for some particular\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\n"To Liverpool--yes," replied he.  "A short journey like that\r\ncouldn\'t fatigue, and might distract her thoughts.  Let her go by\r\nall means,--it would be the very thing for her."\r\n\r\n"O sir!" burst out Mary, almost sobbing; "I did so hope you would\r\nsay she was too ill to go."\r\n\r\n"Whew!"--said he, with a prolonged whistle, trying to understand the\r\ncase; but being, as he said, no reader of newspapers, utterly\r\nunaware of the peculiar reasons there might be for so apparently\r\nunfeeling a wish--"Why did you not tell me so sooner?  It might\r\ncertainly do her harm in her weak state! there is always some risk\r\nattending journeys--draughts, and what not.  To her, they might\r\nprove very injurious,--very.  I disapprove of journeys, or\r\nexcitement, in all cases where the patient is in the low, fluttered\r\nstate in which Mrs. Wilson is.  If you take MY advice, you will\r\ncertainly put a stop to all thoughts of going to Liverpool."  He\r\nreally had completely changed his opinion, though quite\r\nunconsciously; so desirous was he to comply with the wishes of\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n"O sir, thank you!  And will you give me a certificate of her being\r\nunable to go, if the lawyer says he must have one?  The lawyer, you\r\nknow," continued she, seeing him look puzzled, "who is to defend\r\nJem,--it was as a witness against him"--\r\n\r\n"My dear girl!" said he almost angrily, "why did you not state the\r\ncase fully at first? one minute would have done it,--and my dinner\r\nwaiting all this time.  To be sure she can\'t go,--it would be\r\nmadness to think of it; if her evidence could have done good, it\r\nwould have been a different thing.  Come to me for the certificate\r\nany time; that is to say, if the lawyer advises you.  I second the\r\nlawyer; take counsel with both the learned professions--ha, ha, ha."\r\n\r\nAnd laughing at his own joke, he departed, leaving Mary accusing\r\nherself of stupidity in having imagined that every one was as well\r\nacquainted with the facts concerning the trial as she was herself;\r\nfor indeed she had never doubted that the doctor would have been\r\naware of the purpose of poor Mrs. Wilson\'s journey to Liverpool.\r\n\r\nPresently she went to Job (the ever ready Mrs. Davenport keeping\r\nwatch over the two old women), and told him her fears, her plans,\r\nand her proceedings.\r\n\r\nTo her surprise he shook his head doubtfully.\r\n\r\n"It may have an awkward look, if we keep her back.  Lawyers is up to\r\ntricks."\r\n\r\n"But it is no trick," said Mary.  "She is so poorly, she was last\r\nnight so, at least; and to-day she\'s so faded and weak."\r\n\r\n"Poor soul! I dare say.  I only mean for Jem\'s sake; and so much is\r\nknown, it won\'t do now to hang back.  But I\'ll ask Mr. Bridgnorth.\r\nI\'ll e\'en take your doctor\'s advice.  Yo tarry at home, and I\'ll\r\ncome to yo in an hour\'s time.  Go thy ways, wench."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXV.   MRS. WILSON\'S DETERMINATION.\r\n\r\n     "Something there was, what, none presumed to say,\r\n      Clouds lightly passing on a smiling day,--\r\n      Whispers and hints which went from ear to ear,\r\n      And mixed reports no judge on earth could clear."\r\n                                             --CRABBE.\r\n\r\n     "Curious conjectures he may always make,\r\n      And either side of dubious questions take."\r\n                                             --IBID.\r\n\r\nMary went home.  Oh! how her head did ache, and how dizzy her brain\r\nwas growing!  But there would be time enough she felt for giving way\r\nhereafter.\r\n\r\nSo she sat quiet and still by an effort; sitting near the window,\r\nand looking out of it, but seeing nothing, when all at once she\r\ncaught sight of something which roused her up, and made her draw\r\nback.\r\n\r\nBut it was too late.  She had been seen.\r\n\r\nSally Leadbitter flaunted into the little dingy room, making it\r\ngaudy with the Sunday excess of colouring in her dress.\r\n\r\nShe was really curious to see Mary; her connection with a murderer\r\nseemed to have made her into a sort of lusus naturae, and was\r\nalmost, by some, expected to have made a change in her personal\r\nappearance, so earnestly did they stare at her.  But Mary had been\r\ntoo much absorbed the last day or two to notice this.\r\n\r\nNow Sally had a grand view, and looked her over and over (a very\r\ndifferent thing from looking her through and through), and almost\r\nlearnt her off by heart:--"Her every-day gown (Hoyle\'s print you\r\nknow, that lilac thing with the high body) she was so fond of; a\r\nlittle black silk handkerchief just knotted round her neck, like a\r\nboy; her hair all taken back from her face, as if she wanted to keep\r\nher head cool--she would always keep that hair of hers so long; and\r\nher hands twitching continually about"--\r\n\r\nSuch particulars would make Sally into a Gazette Extraordinary the\r\nnext morning at the workroom and were worth coming for, even if\r\nlittle else could be extracted from Mary.\r\n\r\n"Why, Mary!" she began.  "Where have you hidden yourself?  You never\r\nshowed your face all yesterday at Miss Simmonds\'s.  You don\'t fancy\r\nwe think any the worse of you for what\'s come and gone.  Some on us,\r\nindeed, were a bit sorry for the poor young man, as lies stiff and\r\ncold for your sake, Mary; but we shall ne\'er cast it up against you.\r\nMiss Simmonds, too, will be mighty put out if you don\'t come, for\r\nthere\'s a deal of mourning, agait."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t," Mary said, in a low voice.  "I don\'t mean ever to come\r\nagain."\r\n\r\n"Why, Mary!" said Sally, in unfeigned surprise.  "To be sure, you\'ll\r\nhave to be in Liverpool, Tuesday, and maybe Wednesday; but after\r\nthat you\'ll surely come, and tell us all about it.  Miss Simmonds\r\nknows you\'ll have to be off those two days.  But between you and me,\r\nshe\'s a bit of a gossip, and will like hearing all how and about the\r\ntrial, well enough to let you off very easy for your being absent a\r\nday or two.  Besides, Betsy Morgan was saying yesterday, she\r\nshouldn\'t wonder but you\'d prove quite an attraction to customers.\r\nMany a one would come and have their gowns made by Miss Simmonds\r\njust to catch a glimpse at you, at after the trial\'s over.  Really,\r\nMary, you\'ll turn out quite a heroine."\r\n\r\nThe little fingers twitched worse than ever; the large soft eyes\r\nlooked up pleadingly into Sally\'s face; but she went on in the same\r\nstrain, not from any unkind or cruel feeling towards Mary, but\r\nsolely because she was incapable of comprehending her suffering.\r\n\r\nShe had been shocked, of course, at Mr. Carson\'s death, though at\r\nthe same time the excitement was rather pleasant than otherwise; and\r\ndearly now would she have enjoyed the conspicuous notice which Mary\r\nwas sure to receive.\r\n\r\n"How shall you like being cross-examined, Mary?"\r\n\r\n"Not at all," answered Mary, when she found she must answer.\r\n\r\n"La! what impudent fellows those lawyers are!  And their clerks,\r\ntoo, not a bit better.  I shouldn\'t wonder" (in a comforting tone,\r\nand really believing she was giving comfort) "if you picked up a new\r\nsweetheart in Liverpool.  What gown are you going in, Mary?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t know and don\'t care," exclaimed Mary, sick and weary of\r\nher visitor.\r\n\r\n"Well, then! take my advice, and go in that blue merino.  It\'s old\r\nto be sure, and a bit worn at elbows, but folk won\'t notice that,\r\nand th\' colour suits you.  Now mind, Mary.  And I\'ll lend you my\r\nblack-watered scarf," added she really good-naturedly, according to\r\nher sense of things, and withal, a little bit pleased at the idea of\r\nher pet article of dress figuring away on the person of a witness at\r\na trial for murder.  "I\'ll bring it to-morrow before you start."\r\n\r\n"No, don\'t!" said Mary; "thank you, but I don\'t want it."\r\n\r\n"Why, what can you wear?  I know all your clothes as well as I do my\r\nown, and what is there you can wear?  Not your old plaid shawl, I do\r\nhope?  You would not fancy this I have on, more nor the scarf, would\r\nyou?" said she, brightening up at the thought, and willing to lend\r\nit, or anything else.\r\n\r\n"O Sally! don\'t go on talking a-that-ns; how can I think on dress at\r\nsuch a time?  When it\'s a matter of life and death to Jem?"\r\n\r\n"Bless the girl!  It\'s Jem, is it?  Well now, I thought there was\r\nsome sweetheart in the background, when you flew off so with Mr.\r\nCarson.  Then what, in the name of goodness, made him shoot Mr.\r\nHarry?  After you had given up going with him, I mean?  Was he\r\nafraid you\'d be on again?"\r\n\r\n"How dare you say he shot Mr. Harry?" asked Mary, firing up from the\r\nstate of languid indifference into which she had sunk while Sally\r\nhad been settling about her dress.  "But it\'s no matter what you\r\nthink as did not know him.  What grieves me is, that people should\r\ngo on thinking him guilty as did know him," she said, sinking back\r\ninto her former depressed tone and manner.\r\n\r\n"And don\'t you think he did it?" asked Sally.\r\n\r\nMary paused; she was going on too fast with one so curious and so\r\nunscrupulous.  Besides, she remembered how even she herself had, at\r\nfirst, believed him guilty; and she felt it was not for her to cast\r\nstones at those who, on similar evidence, inclined to the same\r\nbelief.  None had given him much benefit of a doubt.  None had faith\r\nin his innocence.  None but his mother; and the heart loved more\r\nthan the head reasoned, and her yearning affection had never for an\r\ninstant entertained the idea that her Jem was a murderer.  But Mary\r\ndisliked the whole conversation; the subject, the manner in which it\r\nwas treated, were all painful, and she had a repugnance to the\r\nperson with whom she spoke.\r\n\r\nShe was thankful, therefore, when Job Legh\'s voice was heard at the\r\ndoor, as he stood with the latch in his hand, talking to a\r\nneighbour, and when Sally jumped up in vexation and said, "There\'s\r\nthat old fogey coming in here, as I\'m alive!  Did your father set\r\nhim to look after you while he was away? or what brings the old chap\r\nhere?  However, I\'m off; I never could abide either him or his prim\r\ngrand-daughter.  Good-bye, Mary."\r\n\r\nSo far in a whisper, then louder, "If you think better of my offer\r\nabout the scarf, Mary, just step in to-morrow before nine, and\r\nyou\'re quite welcome to it."\r\n\r\nShe and Job passed each other at the door, with mutual looks of\r\ndislike, which neither took any pains to conceal.\r\n\r\n"Yon\'s a bold, bad girl," said Job to Mary.\r\n\r\n"She\'s very good-natured," replied Mary, too honourable to abuse a\r\nvisitor, who had only that instant crossed her threshold, and gladly\r\ndwelling on the good quality most apparent in Sally\'s character.\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay! good-natured, generous, jolly, full of fun; there are a\r\nnumber of other names for the good qualities the devil leaves his\r\nchildren, as baits to catch gudgeons with.  D\'ye think folk could be\r\nled astray by one who was every way bad?  Howe\'er, that\'s not what I\r\ncame to talk about.  I\'ve seen Mr. Bridgnorth, and he is in a manner\r\nthe same mind as we; he thinks it would have an awkward look, and\r\nmight tell against the poor lad on his trial; still if she\'s ill\r\nshe\'s ill, and it can\'t be helped."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know if she\'s so bad as all that," said Mary, who began to\r\ndread her part in doing anything which might tell against her poor\r\nlover.  "Will you come and see her, Job?  The doctor seemed to say\r\nas I liked, not as he thought."\r\n\r\n"That\'s because he had no great thought on the subject, either one\r\nway or t\'other," replied Job, whose contempt for medical men pretty\r\nnearly equalled his respect for lawyers.  "But I\'ll go and welcome.\r\nI han not seen th\' ould ladies since their sorrows, and it\'s but\r\nmanners to go and ax after them.  Come along."\r\n\r\nThe room at Mrs. Wilson\'s had that still, changeless look you must\r\nhave often observed in the house of sickness or mourning.  No\r\nparticular employment going on; people watching and waiting rather\r\nthan acting, unless in the more sudden and violent attacks: what\r\nlittle movement is going on, so noiseless and hushed; the furniture\r\nall arranged and stationary, with a view to the comfort of the\r\nafflicted; the window-blinds drawn down to keep out the disturbing\r\nvariety of a sunbeam; the same saddened serious look on the faces of\r\nthe indwellers: you fall back into the same train of thought with\r\nall these associations, and forget the street, the outer world, in\r\nthe contemplation of the one stationary, absorbing interest within.\r\n\r\nMrs. Wilson sat quietly in her chair, with just the same look Mary\r\nhad left on her face; Mrs. Davenport went about with creaking shoes\r\nwhich made all the more noise from her careful and lengthened tread,\r\nannoying the ears of those who were well, in this instance, far more\r\nthan the dull senses of the sick and the sorrowful.  Alice\'s voice\r\nstill was going on cheerfully in the upper room with incessant\r\ntalking and little laughs to herself, or perhaps in sympathy with\r\nher unseen companions; "unseen," I say, in preference to "fancied,"\r\nfor who knows whether God does not permit the forms of those who\r\nwere dearest when living, to hover round the bed of the dying?\r\n\r\nJob spoke, and Mrs. Wilson answered.\r\n\r\nSo quietly that it was unnatural under the circumstances.  It made a\r\ndeeper impression on the old man than any token of mere bodily\r\nillness could have done.  If she had raved in delirium, or moaned in\r\nfever, he could have spoken after his wont, and given his opinion,\r\nhis advice, and his consolation: now he was awed into silence.\r\n\r\nAt length he pulled Mary aside into a corner of the house-place,\r\nwhere Mrs. Wilson was sitting, and began to talk to her.\r\n\r\n"Yo\'re right, Mary!  She\'s no ways fit to go to Liverpool, poor\r\nsoul.  Now I\'ve seen her I only wonder the doctor could ha\' been\r\nunsettled in his mind at th\' first.  Choose how it goes wi\' poor\r\nJem, she cannot go.  One way or another it will soon be over; the\r\nbest to leave her in the state she is till then."\r\n\r\n"I was sure you would think so," said Mary.\r\n\r\nBut they were reckoning without their host.  They esteemed her\r\nsenses gone, while, in fact, they were only inert, and could not\r\nconvey impressions rapidly to the overburdened, troubled brain.\r\nThey had not noticed that her eyes had followed them (mechanically\r\nit seemed at first) as they had moved away to the corner of the\r\nroom; that her face, hitherto so changeless, had begun to work with\r\none or two of the old symptoms of impatience.\r\n\r\nBut when they were silent she stood up, and startled them almost as\r\nif a dead person had spoken, by saying clearly and decidedly--\r\n\r\n"I go to Liverpool.  I hear you and your plans; and I tell you I\r\nshall go to Liverpool.  If my words are to kill my son, they have\r\nalready gone forth out of my mouth, and nought can bring them back.\r\nBut I will have faith.  Alice (up above) has often telled me I\r\nwanted faith, and now I will have it.  They cannot--they will not\r\nkill my child, my only child.  I will not be afeard.  Yet oh! I am\r\nso sick with terror.  But if he is to die, think ye not that I will\r\nsee him again; ay! see him at his trial?  When all are hating him,\r\nhe shall have his poor mother near him, to give him all the comfort,\r\neyes, and looks, and tears, and a heart that is dead to all but him,\r\ncan give; his poor mother, who knows how free he is from sin--in the\r\nsight of man at least.  They\'ll let me go to him, maybe, the very\r\nminute it\'s over; and I know many Scripture texts (though you would\r\nnot think it), that may keep up his heart.  I missed seeing him ere\r\nhe went to yon prison, but nought shall keep me away again one\r\nminute when I can see his face; for maybe the minutes are numbered,\r\nand the count but small.  I know I can be a comfort to him, poor\r\nlad.  You would not think it, now, but he\'d always speak as kind and\r\nsoft to me as if he were courting me, like.  He loved me above a\r\nbit; and am I to leave him now to dree all the cruel slander they\'ll\r\nput upon him?  I can pray for him at each hard word they say against\r\nhim, if I can do nought else; and he\'ll know what his mother is\r\ndoing for him, poor lad, by the look on my face."\r\n\r\nStill they made some look, or gesture of opposition to her wishes.\r\nShe turned sharp round on Mary, the old object of her pettish\r\nattacks, and said, "Now, wench! once for all, I tell you this.  HE\r\ncould never guide me; and he\'d sense enough not to try.  What he\r\ncould na do, don\'t you try.  I shall go to Liverpool tomorrow, and\r\nfind my lad, and stay with him through thick and thin; and if he\r\ndies, why, perhaps, God of His mercy will take me too.  The grave is\r\na sure cure for an aching heart!"\r\n\r\nShe sank back in her chair, quite exhausted by the sudden effort she\r\nhad made; but if they even offered to speak, she cut them short\r\n(whatever the subject might be), with the repetition of the same\r\nwords, "I shall go to Liverpool."\r\n\r\nNo more could be said, the doctor\'s opinion had been so undecided;\r\nMr. Bridgnorth had given his legal voice in favour of her going, and\r\nMary was obliged to relinquish the idea of persuading her to remain\r\nat home, if, indeed, under all the circumstances, it could be\r\nthought desirable.\r\n\r\n"Best way will be," said Job, "for me to hunt out Will, early\r\ntomorrow morning, and yo, Mary, come at after with Jane Wilson.  I\r\nknow a decent woman where yo two can have a bed, and where we may\r\nmeet together when I\'ve found Will, afore going to Mr. Bridgnorth\'s\r\nat two o\'clock; for, I can tell him, I\'ll not trust none of his\r\nclerks for hunting up Will, if Jem\'s life\'s to depend on it."\r\n\r\nNow Mary disliked this plan inexpressibly; her dislike was partly\r\ngrounded on reason, and partly on feeling.  She could not bear the\r\nidea of deputing to any one the active measures necessary to be\r\ntaken in order to save Jem.  She felt as if they were her duty, her\r\nright.  She durst not trust to any one the completion of her plan:\r\nthey might not have energy, or perseverance, or desperation enough\r\nto follow out the slightest chance; and her love would endow her\r\nwith all these qualities independently of the terrible alternative\r\nwhich awaited her in case all failed and Jem was condemned.  No one\r\ncould have her motives; and consequently no one could have her\r\nsharpened brain, her despairing determination.  Besides (only that\r\nwas purely selfish), she could not endure the suspense of remaining\r\nquiet, and only knowing the result when all was accomplished.\r\n\r\nSo with vehemence and impatience she rebutted every reason Job\r\nadduced for his plan; and of course, thus opposed, by what appeared\r\nto him wilfulness, he became more resolute, and angry words were\r\nexchanged, and a feeling of estrangement rose up between them, for a\r\ntime, as they walked homewards.\r\n\r\nBut then came in Margaret with her gentleness, like an angel of\r\npeace, so calm and reasonable, that both felt ashamed of their\r\nirritation, and tacitly left the decision to her (only, by the way,\r\nI think Mary could never have submitted if it had gone against her,\r\npenitent and tearful as was her manner now to Job, the good old man\r\nwho was helping her to work for Jem, although they differed as to\r\nthe manner).\r\n\r\n"Mary had better go," said Margaret to her grandfather, in a low\r\ntone; "I know what she\'s feeling, and it will be a comfort to her\r\nsoon, maybe, to think she did all she could herself.  She would,\r\nperhaps, fancy it might have been different; do, grandfather, let\r\nher."\r\n\r\nMargaret had still, you see, little or no belief in Jem\'s innocence\r\nand besides, she thought if Mary saw Will, and heard herself from\r\nhim that Jem had not been with him that Thursday night, it would in\r\na measure break the force of the blow which was impending.\r\n\r\n"Let me lock up house, grandfather, for a couple of days, and go and\r\nstay with Alice.  It\'s but little one like me can do, I know" (she\r\nadded softly); "but, by the blessing o\' God, I\'ll do it and welcome;\r\nand here comes one kindly use o\' money, I can hire them as will do\r\nfor her what I cannot.  Mrs. Davenport is a willing body, and one\r\nwho knows sorrow and sickness, and I can pay her for her time, and\r\nkeep her there pretty near altogether.  So let that be settled.  And\r\nyou take Mrs. Wilson, dear grandad, and let Mary go find Will, and\r\nyou can all meet together at after, and I\'m sure I wish you luck."\r\n\r\nJob consented with only a few dissenting grunts; but on the whole\r\nwith a very good grace for an old man who had been so positive only\r\na few minutes before.\r\n\r\nMary was thankful for Margaret\'s interference.  She did not speak,\r\nbut threw her arms round Margaret\'s neck, and put up her rosy-red\r\nmouth to be kissed; and even Job was attracted by the pretty,\r\nchild-like gesture; and when she drew near him, afterwards, like a\r\nlittle creature sidling up to some person whom it feels to have\r\noffended, he bent down and blessed her, as if she had been a child\r\nof his own.\r\n\r\nTo Mary the old man\'s blessing came like words of power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVI.   THE JOURNEY TO LIVERPOOL.\r\n\r\n     "Like a bark upon the sea,\r\n        Life is floating over death;\r\n      Above, below, encircling thee,\r\n        Danger lurks in every breath.\r\n\r\n     "Parted art thou from the grave\r\n        Only by a plank most frail;\r\n      Tossed upon the restless wave,\r\n        Sport of every fickle gale.\r\n\r\n     "Let the skies be e\'er so clear,\r\n        And so calm and still the sea,\r\n      Shipwreck yet has he to fear\r\n        Who life\'s voyager will be."\r\n                             --RUCKERT.\r\n\r\nThe early trains for Liverpool, on Monday morning, were  crowded by\r\nattorneys, attorneys\' clerks, plaintiffs, defendants, and witnesses,\r\nall going to the Assizes.  They were a motley assembly, each with\r\nsome cause for anxiety stirring at his heart; though, after all,\r\nthat is saying little or nothing, for we are all of us in the same\r\npredicament through life; each with a fear and a hope from childhood\r\nto death.  Among the passengers there was Mary Barton, dressed in\r\nthe blue gown and obnoxious plaid shawl.\r\n\r\nCommon as railroads are now in all places as a means of transit, and\r\nespecially in Manchester, Mary had never been on one before; and she\r\nfelt bewildered by the hurry, the noise of people, and bells, and\r\nhorns; the whiz and the scream of the arriving trains.\r\n\r\nThe very journey itself seemed to her a matter of wonder.  She had a\r\nback seat, and looked towards the factory-chimneys, and the cloud of\r\nsmoke which hovers over Manchester, with a feeling akin to the\r\n"Heimweh."  She was losing sight of the familiar objects of her\r\nchildhood for the first time; and unpleasant as those objects are to\r\nmost, she yearned after them with some of the same sentiment which\r\ngives pathos to the thoughts of the emigrant.\r\n\r\nThe cloud-shadows which give beauty to Chat-Moss, the picturesque\r\nold houses of Newton, what were they to Mary, whose heart was full\r\nof many things?  Yet she seemed to look at them earnestly as they\r\nglided past; but she neither saw nor heard.\r\n\r\nShe neither saw nor heard till some well-known names fell upon her\r\near.\r\n\r\nTwo lawyers\' clerks were discussing the cases to come on that\r\nAssizes; of course, "the murder case," as it had come to be termed,\r\nheld a conspicuous place in their conversation.\r\n\r\nThey had no doubt of the result.\r\n\r\n"Juries are always very unwilling to convict on circumstantial\r\nevidence, it is true," said one, "but here there can hardly be any\r\ndoubt."\r\n\r\n"If it had not been so clear a case," replied the other, "I should\r\nhave said they were injudicious in hurrying on the trial so much.\r\nStill, more evidence might have been collected."\r\n\r\n"They tell me," said the first speaker--"the people in Gardener\'s\r\noffice, I mean--that it was really feared the old gentleman would\r\nhave gone out of his mind, if the trial had been delayed.  He was\r\nwith Mr. Gardener as many as seven times on Saturday, and called him\r\nup at night to suggest that some letter should be written, or\r\nsomething done to secure the verdict."\r\n\r\n"Poor old man," answered his companion, "who can wonder?--an only\r\nson,--such a death,--the disagreeable circumstances attending it; I\r\nhad not time to read the Guardian on Saturday, but I understand it\r\nwas some dispute about a factory girl."\r\n\r\n"Yes, some such person.  Of course she\'ll be examined, and Williams\r\nwill do it in style.  I shall slip out from our court to hear him,\r\nif I can hit the nick of time."\r\n\r\n"And if you can get a place, you mean, for depend upon it the court\r\nwill be crowded."\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay, the ladies (sweet souls) will come in shoals to hear a\r\ntrial for murder, and see the murderer, and watch the judge put on\r\nhis black cap."\r\n\r\n"And then go home and groan over the Spanish ladies who take delight\r\nin bull-fights--\'such unfeminine creatures!\'"\r\n\r\nThen they went on to other subjects.\r\n\r\nIt was but another drop to Mary\'s cup; but she was nearly in that\r\nstate which Crabbe describes--\r\n\r\n     "For when so full the cup of sorrows flows,\r\n      Add but a drop it instantly o\'erflows."\r\n\r\nAnd now they were in the tunnel!--and now they were in Liverpool;\r\nand she must rouse herself from the torpor of mind and body which\r\nwas creeping over her; the result of much anxiety and fatigue, and\r\nseveral sleepless nights.\r\n\r\nShe asked a policeman the way to Milk House Yard, and following his\r\ndirections with the savoir faire of a town-bred girl, she reached a\r\nlittle court leading out of a busy, thronged street, not far from\r\nthe Docks.\r\n\r\nWhen she entered the quiet little yard, she stopped to regain her\r\nbreath, and to gather strength, for her limbs trembled, and her\r\nheart beat violently.\r\n\r\nAll the unfavourable contingencies she had, until now, forbidden\r\nherself to dwell upon, came forward to her mind--the possibility,\r\nthe bare possibility, of Jem being an accomplice in the murder--the\r\nstill greater possibility that he had not fulfilled his intention of\r\ngoing part of the way with Will, but had been led off by some little\r\naccidental occurrence from his original intention; and that he had\r\nspent the evening with those, whom it was now too late to bring\r\nforward as witnesses.\r\n\r\nBut sooner or later she must know the truth; so, taking courage, she\r\nknocked at the door of a house.\r\n\r\n"Is this Mrs. Jones\'s?" she inquired.\r\n\r\n"Next door but one," was the curt answer.\r\n\r\nAnd even this extra minute was a reprieve.\r\n\r\nMrs. Jones was busy washing, and would have spoken angrily to the\r\nperson who knocked so gently at the door, if anger had been in her\r\nnature; but she was a soft, helpless kind of woman, and only sighed\r\nover the many interruptions she had had to her business that unlucky\r\nMonday morning.\r\n\r\nBut the feeling which would have been anger in a more impatient\r\ntemper, took the form of prejudice against the disturber, whoever he\r\nor she might be.\r\n\r\nMary\'s fluttered and excited appearance strengthened this prejudice\r\nin Mrs. Jones\'s mind, as she stood, stripping the soap-suds off her\r\narms, while she eyed her visitor, and waited to be told what her\r\nbusiness was.\r\n\r\nBut no words would come.  Mary\'s voice seemed choked up in her\r\nthroat.\r\n\r\n"Pray what do you want, young woman?" coldly asked Mrs. Jones at\r\nlast.\r\n\r\n"I want--oh! is Will Wilson here?"\r\n\r\n"No, he is not," replied Mrs. Jones, inclining to shut the door in\r\nher face.\r\n\r\n"Is he not come back from the Isle of Man?" asked Mary, sickening.\r\n\r\n"He never went; he stayed in Manchester too long; as perhaps you\r\nknow, already."\r\n\r\nAnd again the door seemed closing.\r\n\r\nBut Mary bent forwards with suppliant action (as some young tree\r\nbends, when blown by the rough, autumnal wind), and gasped out--\r\n\r\n"Tell me--tell--me--where is he?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Jones suspected some love affair, and, perhaps, one of not the\r\nmost creditable kind; but the distress of the pale young creature\r\nbefore her was so obvious and so pitiable, that were she ever so\r\nsinful, Mrs. Jones could no longer uphold her short, reserved\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n"He\'s gone this very morning, my poor girl.  Step in, and I\'ll tell\r\nyou about it."\r\n\r\n"Gone!" cried \'Mary.  "How gone?  I must see him,--it\'s a matter of\r\nlife and death: he can save the innocent from being hanged,--he\r\ncannot be gone,--how gone?"\r\n\r\n"Sailed, my dear! sailed in the John Cropper this very blessed\r\nmorning."\r\n\r\n"Sailed!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVII.   IN THE LIVERPOOL DOCKS.\r\n\r\n                         "Yon is our quay!\r\n      Hark to the clamour in that miry road,\r\n      Bounded and narrowed by yon vessel\'s load;\r\n      The lumbering wealth she empties round the place,\r\n      Package and parcel, hogshead, chest, and case;\r\n      While the loud seaman and the angry hind,\r\n      Mingling in business, bellow to the wind."\r\n                                          --CRABBE.\r\n\r\nMary staggered into the house.  Mrs. Jones placed her tenderly in a\r\nchair, and there stood bewildered by her side.\r\n\r\n"O father! father!" muttered she, "what have you done!--What must I\r\ndo? must the innocent die?--or he--whom I fear--I fear--oh! what am\r\nI saying?" said she, looking round affrighted, and, seemingly\r\nreassured by Mrs. Jones\'s countenance, "I am so helpless, so weak--\r\nbut a poor girl, after all.  How can I tell what is right?  Father!\r\nyou have always been so kind to me,--and you to be--never mind--\r\nnever mind, all will come right in the grave."\r\n\r\n"Save us, and bless us!" exclaimed Mrs. Jones, "if I don\'t think\r\nshe\'s gone out of her wits!"\r\n\r\n"No, I am not," said Mary, catching at the words, and with a strong\r\neffort controlling the mind she felt to be wandering, while the red\r\nblood flushed to scarlet the heretofore white cheek,--"I\'m not out\r\nof my senses; there is so much to be done--so much--and no one but\r\nme to do it, you know--though I can\'t rightly tell what it is,"\r\nlooking up with bewilderment into Mrs. Jones\'s face.  "I must not go\r\nmad whatever comes--at least not yet.  No!" (bracing herself up)\r\n"something may yet be done, and I must do it.  Sailed! did you say?\r\nThe John Cropper?  Sailed?"\r\n\r\n"Ay! she went out of dock last night, to be ready for the morning\'s\r\ntide."\r\n\r\n"I thought she was not to sail till to-morrow," murmured Mary.\r\n\r\n"So did Will (he\'s lodged here long, so we all call him \'Will\'),"\r\nreplied Mrs. Jones.  "The mate had told him so, I believe, and he\r\nnever knew different till he got to Liverpool on Friday morning; but\r\nas soon as he heard, he gave up going to the Isle o\' Man, and just\r\nran over to Rhyl with the mate, one John Harris, as has friends a\r\nbit beyond Abergele; you may have heard him speak on him; for they\r\nare great chums, though I\'ve my own opinion of Harris."\r\n\r\n"And he\'s sailed?" repeated Mary, trying by repetition to realise\r\nthe fact to herself.\r\n\r\n"Ay, he went on board last night to be ready for the morning\'s tide,\r\nas I said afore, and my boy went to see the ship go down the river,\r\nand came back all agog with the sight.  Here, Charley, Charley!"\r\n\r\nShe called out loudly for her son; but Charley was one of those boys\r\nwho are never "far to seek," as the Lancashire people say, when\r\nanything is going on; a mysterious conversation, an unusual event, a\r\nfire, or a riot, anything in short; such boys are the little\r\nomnipresent people of this world.\r\n\r\nCharley had, in fact, been spectator and auditor all this time;\r\nthough for a little while he had been engaged in "dollying" and a\r\nfew other mischievous feats in the washing line, which had prevented\r\nhis attention from being fully given to his mother\'s conversation\r\nwith the strange girl who had entered.\r\n\r\n"O Charley! there you are!  Did you not see the John Cropper sail\r\ndown the river this morning?  Tell the young woman about it, for I\r\nthink she hardly credits me."\r\n\r\n"I saw her tugged down the river by a steamboat, which comes to the\r\nsame thing," replied he.\r\n\r\n"Oh! if I had but come last night!" moaned Mary.  "But I never\r\nthought of it.  I never thought but what he knew right when he said\r\nhe would be back from the Isle of Man on Monday morning, and not\r\nafore--and now some one must die for my negligence!"\r\n\r\n"Die!" exclaimed the lad.  "How?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! Will would have proved an alibi,--but he\'s gone,--and what am I\r\nto do?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t give it up yet," cried the energetic boy, interested at once\r\nin the case; "let\'s have a try for him.  We are but where we were,\r\nif we fail."\r\n\r\nMary roused herself.  The sympathetic "we" gave her heart and hope.\r\n\r\n"But what can be done?  You say he\'s sailed; what can be done?"  But\r\nshe spoke louder, and in a more life-like tone.\r\n\r\n"No!  I did not say he\'d sailed; mother said that, and women know\r\nnought about such matters.  You see" (proud of his office of\r\ninstructor, and insensibly influenced, as all about her were, by\r\nMary\'s sweet, earnest, lovely countenance), "there\'s sandbanks at\r\nthe mouth of the river, and ships can\'t get over them but at\r\nhigh-water; especially ships of heavy burden, like the John Cropper.\r\nNow she was tugged down the river at low water, or pretty near, and\r\nwill have to lie some time before the water will be high enough to\r\nfloat her over the banks.  So hold up your head,--you\'ve a chance\r\nyet, though, maybe, but a poor one."\r\n\r\n"But what must I do?" asked Mary, to whom all this explanation had\r\nbeen a vague mystery.\r\n\r\n"Do!" said the boy impatiently, "why, have not I told you?  Only\r\nwomen (begging your pardon) are so stupid at understanding about\r\nanything belonging to the sea;--you must get a boat, and make all\r\nhaste, and sail after him,--after the John Cropper.  You may\r\novertake her, or you may not.  It\'s just a chance; but she\'s heavy\r\nladen, and that\'s in your favour.  She\'ll draw many feet of water."\r\n\r\nMary had humbly and eagerly (oh, how eagerly!) listened to this\r\nyoung Sir Oracle\'s speech; but try as she would, she could only\r\nunderstand that she must make haste, and sail--somewhere.\r\n\r\n"I beg your pardon," (and her little acknowledgment of inferiority\r\nin this speech pleased the lad, and made him her still more zealous\r\nfriend).  "I beg your pardon," said she, "but I don\'t know where to\r\nget a boat.  Are there boat-stands?"\r\n\r\nThe lad laughed outright.\r\n\r\n"You\'re not long in Liverpool, I guess.  Boat-stands!  No; go down\r\nto the pier,--any pier will do, and hire a boat,--you\'ll be at no\r\nloss when once you are there.  Only make haste."\r\n\r\n"Oh, you need not tell me that, if I but knew how," said Mary,\r\ntrembling with eagerness.  "But you say right,--I never was here\r\nbefore, and I don\'t know my way to the place you speak on; only tell\r\nme, and I\'ll not lose a minute."\r\n\r\n"Mother!" said the wilful lad, "I\'m going to show her the way to the\r\npier; I\'ll be back in an hour,--or so," he added in a lower tone.\r\n\r\nAnd before the gentle Mrs. Jones could collect her scattered wits\r\nsufficiently to understand half of the hastily-formed plan, her son\r\nwas scudding down the street, closely followed by Mary\'s\r\nhalf-running steps.\r\n\r\nPresently he slackened his pace sufficiently to enable him to enter\r\ninto conversation with Mary, for once escaped from the reach of his\r\nmother\'s recalling voice, he thought he might venture to indulge his\r\ncuriosity.\r\n\r\n"Ahem!--What\'s your name?  It\'s so awkward to be calling you young\r\nwoman."\r\n\r\n"My name is Mary,--Mary Barton," answered she, anxious to propitiate\r\none who seemed so willing to exert himself in her behalf, or else\r\nshe grudged every word which caused the slightest relaxation in her\r\nspeed, although her chest seemed tightened, and her head throbbing,\r\nfrom the rate at which they were walking.\r\n\r\n"And you want Will Wilson to prove an alibi--is that it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes--oh, yes,--can we not cross now?"\r\n\r\n"No, wait a minute; it\'s the teagle hoisting above your head I\'m\r\nafraid of; and who is it that\'s to be tried?"\r\n\r\n"Jem; oh, lad! can\'t we get past?"\r\n\r\nThey rushed under the great bales quivering in the air above their\r\nheads and pressed onward for a few minutes, till Master Charley\r\nagain saw fit to walk a little slower, and ask a few more questions.\r\n\r\n"Mary, is Jem your brother, or your sweetheart, that you\'re so set\r\nupon saving him?"\r\n\r\n"No--no," replied she, but with something of hesitation, that made\r\nthe shrewd boy yet more anxious to clear up the mystery.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps he\'s your cousin, then?  Many a girl has a cousin who has\r\nnot a sweetheart."\r\n\r\n"No, he\'s neither kith nor kin to me.  What\'s the matter?  What are\r\nyou stopping for?" said she, with nervous terror, as Charley turned\r\nback a few steps, and peered up a side street.\r\n\r\n"Oh, nothing to flurry you so, Mary.  I heard you say to mother you\r\nhad never been in Liverpool before, and if you\'ll only look up this\r\nstreet you may see the back windows of our Exchange.  Such a\r\nbuilding as yon is! with \'natomy hiding under a blanket, and Lord\r\nAdmiral Nelson, and a few more people in the middle of the court!\r\nNo! come here," as Mary, in her eagerness, was looking at any window\r\nthat caught her eye first, to satisfy the boy.  "Here then, now you\r\ncan see it.  You can say, now, you\'ve seen Liverpool Exchange."\r\n\r\n"Yes, to be sure--it\'s a beautiful window, I\'m sure.  But are we\r\nnear the boats?  I\'ll stop as I come back, you know; only I think\r\nwe\'d better get on now."\r\n\r\n"Oh! if the wind\'s in your favour you\'ll be down the river in no\r\ntime, and catch Will, I\'ll be bound; and if it\'s not, why, you know\r\nthe minute it took you to look at the Exchange will be neither here\r\nnor there."\r\n\r\nAnother rush onwards, till one of the long crossings near the Docks\r\ncaused a stoppage, and gave Mary time for breathing, and Charley\r\nleisure to ask another question.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve never said where you come from?"\r\n\r\n"Manchester," replied she.\r\n\r\n"Eh, then! you\'ve a power of things to see.  Liverpool beats\r\nManchester hollow, they say.  A nasty, smoky hole, bean\'t it?  Are\r\nyou bound to live there?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes! it\'s my home."\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t think I could abide a home in the middle of smoke.\r\nLook there! now you see the river.  That\'s something now you\'d give\r\na deal for in Manchester.  Look!"\r\n\r\nAnd Mary did look, and saw down an opening made in the forest of\r\nmasts belonging to the vessels in dock, the glorious river, along\r\nwhich white-sailed ships were gliding with the ensigns of all\r\nnations, not "braving the battle," but telling of the distant lands,\r\nspicy or frozen, that sent to that mighty mart for their comforts or\r\ntheir luxuries; she saw small boats passing to and fro on that\r\nglittering highway, but she also saw such puffs and clouds of smoke\r\nfrom the countless steamers, that she wondered at Charley\'s\r\nintolerance of the smoke of Manchester.  Across the swing-bridge,\r\nalong the pier,--and they stood breathless by a magnificent dock,\r\nwhere hundreds of ships lay motionless during the process of loading\r\nand unloading.  The cries of the sailors, the variety of languages\r\nused by the passers-by, and the entire novelty of the sight compared\r\nwith anything which Mary had ever seen, made her feel most helpless\r\nand forlorn; and she clung to her young guide as to one who alone by\r\nhis superior knowledge could interpret between her and the new race\r\nof men by whom she was surrounded,--for a new race sailors might\r\nreasonably be considered, to a girl who had hitherto seen none but\r\ninland dwellers, and those for the greater part factory people.\r\n\r\nIn that new world of sight and sound, she still bore one prevailing\r\nthought, and though her eye glanced over the ships and the\r\nwide-spreading river, her mind was full of the thought of reaching\r\nWill.\r\n\r\n"Why are we here?" asked she of Charley.  "There are no little boats\r\nabout, and I thought I was to go in a little boat; those ships are\r\nnever meant for short distances, are they?"\r\n\r\n"To be sure not," replied he, rather contemptuously.  "But the John\r\nCropper lay in this dock, and I know many of the sailors; and if I\r\ncould see one I knew, I\'d ask him to run up the mast, and see if he\r\ncould catch a sight of her in the offing.  If she\'s weighed her\r\nanchor, no use for your going, you know."\r\n\r\nMary assented quietly to this speech, as if she were as careless as\r\nCharley seemed now to be about her overtaking Will; but in truth her\r\nheart was sinking within her, and she no longer felt the energy\r\nwhich had hitherto upheld her.  Her bodily strength was giving way,\r\nand she stood cold and shivering, although the noonday sun beat down\r\nwith considerable power on the shadeless spot where she was\r\nstanding.\r\n\r\n"Here\'s Tom Bourne!" said Charley; and altering his manner from the\r\npatronising key in which he had spoken to Mary, he addressed a\r\nweather-beaten old sailor who came rolling along the pathway where\r\nthey stood, his hands in his pockets, and his quid in his mouth,\r\nwith very much the air of one who had nothing to do but look about\r\nhim, and spit right and left; addressing this old tar, Charley made\r\nknown to him his wish in slang, which to Mary was almost inaudible,\r\nand quite unintelligible, and which I am too much of a land-lubber\r\nto repeat correctly.\r\n\r\nMary watched looks and actions with a renovated keenness of\r\nperception.\r\n\r\nShe saw the old man listen attentively to Charley; she saw him eye\r\nher over from head to foot, and wind up his inspection with a little\r\nnod of approbation (for her very shabbiness and poverty of dress\r\nwere creditable signs to the experienced old sailor), and then she\r\nwatched him leisurely swing himself on to a ship in the basin, and,\r\nborrowing a glass, run up the mast with the speed of a monkey.\r\n\r\n"He\'ll fall!" said she, in affright, clutching at Charley\'s arm, and\r\njudging the sailor, from his storm-marked face and unsteady walk on\r\nland, to be much older than he really was.\r\n\r\n"Not he!" said Charley.  "He\'s at the mast-head now.  See! he\'s\r\nlooking through his glass, and using his arms as steady as if he\r\nwere on dry land.  Why, I\'ve been up the mast, many and many a time;\r\nonly don\'t tell mother.  She thinks I\'m to be a shoemaker, but I\'ve\r\nmade up my mind to be a sailor; only there\'s no good arguing with a\r\nwoman.  You\'ll not tell her, Mary?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, see!" exclaimed she (his secret was very safe with her, for, in\r\nfact, she had not heard it); "see! he\'s coming down; he\'s down.\r\nSpeak to him, Charley."\r\n\r\nBut, unable to wait another instant, she called out herself--\r\n\r\n"Can you see the John Cropper?  Is she there yet?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay," he answered, and coming quickly up to them, he hurried\r\nthem away to seek for a boat, saying the bar was already covered,\r\nand in an hour the ship would hoist her sails and be off.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve the wind right against you, and must use oars.  No time to\r\nlose."\r\n\r\nThey ran to some steps leading down to the water.  They beckoned to\r\nsome watermen, who, suspecting the real state of the case, appeared\r\nin no hurry for a fare, but leisurely brought their boat alongside\r\nthe stairs, as if it were a matter of indifference to them whether\r\nthey were engaged or not, while they conversed together in few\r\nwords, and in an undertone, respecting the charge they should make.\r\n\r\n"Oh, pray make haste," called Mary.  "I want you to take me to the\r\nJohn Cropper.  Where is she, Charley?  Tell them--I don\'t rightly\r\nknow the words--only make haste!"\r\n\r\n"In the offing she is, sure enough, miss," answered one of the men,\r\nshoving Charley on one side, regarding him as too young to be a\r\nprincipal in the bargain.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think we can go, Dick," said he, with a wink to his\r\ncompanion;  "there\'s the gentleman over at New Brighton as wants\r\nus."\r\n\r\n"But, mayhap, the young woman will pay us handsome for giving her a\r\nlast look at her sweetheart," interposed the other.\r\n\r\n"Oh, how much do you want?  Only make haste--I\'ve enough to pay you,\r\nbut every moment is precious," said Mary.\r\n\r\n"Ay, that it is.  Less than an hour won\'t take us to the mouth of\r\nthe river, and she\'ll be off by two o\'clock!"\r\n\r\nPoor Mary\'s ideas of "plenty of money," however, were different to\r\nthose entertained by the boatmen.  Only fourteen or fifteen\r\nshillings remained out of the sovereign Margaret had lent her, and\r\nthe boatmen, imagining "plenty" to mean no less than several pounds,\r\ninsisted upon receiving a sovereign (an exorbitant fare, by-the-bye,\r\nalthough reduced from their first demand of thirty shillings).\r\n\r\nWhile Charley, with a boy\'s impatience of delay, and disregard to\r\nmoney, kept urging--\r\n\r\n"Give it \'em, Mary; they\'ll none of them take you for less.  It\'s\r\nyour only chance.  There\'s St. Nicholas ringing one!"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve only got fourteen and ninepence," cried she in despair, after\r\ncounting over her money; "but I\'ll give you my shawl, and you can\r\nsell it for four or five shillings--oh! won\'t that much do?" asked\r\nshe, in such a tone of voice, that they must indeed have had hard\r\nhearts who could refuse such agonised entreaty.\r\n\r\nThey took her on board.\r\n\r\nAnd in less than five minutes she was rocking and tossing in a boat\r\nfor the first time in her life, alone with two rough, hard-looking\r\nmen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVIII.   "JOHN CROPPER," AHOY!\r\n\r\n     "A wet sheet and a flowing sea,\r\n        A wind that follows fast\r\n      And fills the white and rustling sail,\r\n        And bends the gallant mast!\r\n      And bends the gallant mast, my boys,\r\n        While, like the eagle free,\r\n      Away the good ship flies, and leaves\r\n        Old England on the lee."\r\n                         --ALLAN CUNNINGHAM.\r\n\r\nMary had not understood that Charley was not coming with her.  In\r\nfact, she had not thought about it, till she perceived his absence,\r\nas they pushed off from the landing-place, and remembered that she\r\nhad never thanked him for all his kind interest in her behalf; and\r\nnow his absence made her feel most lonely--even his, the little\r\nmushroom friend of an hour\'s growth.\r\n\r\nThe boat threaded her way through the maze of larger vessels which\r\nsurrounded the shore, bumping against one, kept off by the oars from\r\ngoing right against another, overshadowed by a third, until at\r\nlength they were fairly out on the broad river, away from either\r\nshore; the sights and sounds of land being heard in the distance.\r\n\r\nAnd then came a sort of pause.\r\n\r\nBoth wind and tide were against the two men, and labour as they\r\nwould they made but little way.  Once Mary in her impatience had\r\nrisen up to obtain a better view of the progress they had made; but\r\nthe men had roughly told her to sit down immediately, and she had\r\ndropped on her seat like a chidden child, although the impatience\r\nwas still at her heart.\r\n\r\nBut now she grew sure they were turning off from the straight course\r\nwhich they had hitherto kept on the Cheshire side of the river,\r\nwhither they had gone to avoid the force of the current, and after a\r\nshort time she could not help naming her conviction, as a kind of\r\nnightmare dread and belief came over her, that everything animate\r\nand inanimate was in league against her one sole aim and object of\r\novertaking Will.\r\n\r\nThey answered gruffly.  They saw a boatman whom they knew, and were\r\ndesirous of obtaining his services as a steersman, so that both\r\nmight row with greater effect.  They knew what they were about.  So\r\nshe sat silent with clenched hands while the parley went on, the\r\nexplanation was given, the favour asked and granted.  But she was\r\nsickening all the time with nervous fear.\r\n\r\nThey had been rowing a long, long time--half a day it seemed, at\r\nleast--yet Liverpool appeared still close at hand, and Mary began\r\nalmost to wonder that the men were not as much disheartened as she\r\nwas, when the wind, which had been hitherto against them, dropped,\r\nand thin clouds began to gather over the sky, shutting out the sun,\r\nand casting a chilly gloom over everything.\r\n\r\nThere was not a breath of air, and yet it was colder than when the\r\nsoft violence of the westerly wind had been felt.\r\n\r\nThe men renewed their efforts.  The boat gave a bound forwards at\r\nevery pull of the oars.  The water was glassy and motionless,\r\nreflecting tint by tint of the Indian-ink sky above.  Mary shivered,\r\nand her heart sank within her.  Still, now they evidently were\r\nmaking progress.  Then the steersman pointed to a rippling line on\r\nthe river only a little way off, and the men disturbed Mary, who was\r\nwatching the ships that lay in what appeared to her the open sea, to\r\nget at their sails.\r\n\r\nShe gave a little start, and rose.  Her patience, her grief, and\r\nperhaps her silence, had begun to win upon the men.\r\n\r\n"Yon second to the norrard is the John Cropper.  Wind\'s right now,\r\nand sails will soon carry us alongside of her."\r\n\r\nHe had forgotten (or perhaps he did not like to remind Mary) that\r\nthe same wind which now bore their little craft along with easy,\r\nrapid motion, would also be favourable to the John Cropper.\r\n\r\nBut as they looked with straining eyes, as if to measure the\r\ndecreasing distance that separated them from her, they saw her sails\r\nunfurled and flap in the breeze, till, catching the right point,\r\nthey bellied forth into white roundness, and the ship began to\r\nplunge and heave, as if she were a living creature, impatient to be\r\noff.\r\n\r\n"They\'re heaving anchor!" said one of the boatmen to the other, as\r\nthe faint musical cry of the sailors came floating over the waters\r\nthat still separated them.\r\n\r\nFull of the spirit of the chase, though as yet ignorant of Mary\'s\r\nmotives, the men sprung to hoist another sail.  It was fully as much\r\nas the boat could bear, in the keen, gusty east wind which was now\r\nblowing, and she bent, and laboured, and ploughed, and creaked\r\nupbraidingly as if tasked beyond her strength; but she sped along\r\nwith a gallant swiftness.\r\n\r\nThey drew nearer, and they heard the distant "ahoy" more clearly.\r\nIt ceased.  The anchor was up, and the ship was away.\r\n\r\nMary stood up, steadying herself by the mast, and stretched out her\r\narms, imploring the flying vessel to stay its course, by that mute\r\naction, while the tears streamed down her cheeks.  The men caught up\r\ntheir oars and hoisted them in the air, and shouted to arrest\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nThey were seen by the men aboard the larger craft; but they were too\r\nbusy with all the confusion prevalent in an outward-bound vessel to\r\npay much attention.  There were coils of ropes and seamen\'s chests\r\nto be stumbled over at every turn; there were animals, not properly\r\nsecured, roaming bewildered about the deck, adding their pitiful\r\nlowings and bleatings to the aggregate of noises.  There were\r\ncarcases not cut up, looking like corpses of sheep and pigs rather\r\nthan like mutton and pork; there were sailors running here and there\r\nand everywhere, having had no time to fall into method, and with\r\ntheir minds divided between thoughts of the land and the people they\r\nhad left, and the present duties on board ship; while the captain\r\nstrove hard to procure some kind of order by hasty commands given in\r\na loud, impatient voice, to right and left, starboard and larboard,\r\ncabin and steerage.\r\n\r\nAs he paced the deck with a chafed step, vexed at one or two little\r\nmistakes on the part of the mate, and suffering himself from the\r\npain of separation from wife and children, but showing his suffering\r\nonly by his outward irritation, he heard a hail from the shabby\r\nlittle river boat that was striving to overtake his winged ship.\r\nFor the men fearing that, as the ship was now fairly over the bar,\r\nthey should only increase the distance between them, and being now\r\nwithin shouting range, had asked of Mary her more particular desire.\r\n\r\nHer throat was dry, all musical sound had gone out of her voice; but\r\nin a loud, harsh whisper she told the men her errand of life and\r\ndeath, and they hailed the ship.\r\n\r\n"We\'re come for one William Wilson, who is wanted to prove an alibi\r\nin Liverpool Assize Courts to-morrow.  James Wilson is to be tried\r\nfor a murder done on Thursday night when he was with William Wilson.\r\nAnything more, missis?" asked the boatman of Mary, in a lower voice,\r\nand taking his hands down from his mouth.\r\n\r\n"Say I\'m Mary Barton.  Oh, the ship is going on!  Oh, for the love\r\nof Heaven, ask them to stop."\r\n\r\nThe boatman was angry at the little regard paid to his summons, and\r\ncalled out again; repeating the message with the name of the young\r\nwoman who sent it, and interlarding it with sailors\' oaths.\r\n\r\nThe ship flew along--away--the boat struggled after.\r\n\r\nThey could see the captain take his speaking-trumpet.  And oh! and\r\nalas! they heard his words.\r\n\r\nHe swore a dreadful oath; he called Mary a disgraceful name! and he\r\nsaid he would not stop his ship for any one, nor could he part with\r\na single hand, whoever swung for it.\r\n\r\nThe words came in unpitying clearness with their trumpet-sound.\r\nMary sat down looking like one who prays in the death agony.  For\r\nher eyes were turned up to that heaven, where mercy dwelleth, while\r\nher blue lips quivered, though no sound came.  Then she bowed her\r\nhead, and hid it in her hands.\r\n\r\n"Hark! yon sailor hails us."\r\n\r\nShe looked up, and her heart stopped its beating to listen.\r\n\r\nWilliam Wilson stood as near the stern of the vessel as he could\r\nget; and unable to obtain the trumpet from the angry captain, made a\r\ntube of his own hands.\r\n\r\n"So help me God, Mary Barton, I\'ll come back in the pilot-boat time\r\nenough to save the life of the innocent."\r\n\r\n"What does he say?" asked Mary wildly, as the voice died away in the\r\nincreasing distance, while the boatmen cheered, in their kindled\r\nsympathy with their passenger.\r\n\r\n"What does he say?" repeated she.  "Tell me.  I could not hear."\r\n\r\nShe had heard with her ears, but her brain refused to recognise the\r\nsense.\r\n\r\nThey repeated his speech, all three speaking at once, with many\r\ncomments; while Mary looked at them and then at the vessel far away.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t rightly know about it," said she sorrowfully.  "What is the\r\npilot-boat?"\r\n\r\nThey told her, and she gathered the meaning out of the sailors\'\r\nslang which enveloped it.  There was a hope still, although so\r\nslight and faint.\r\n\r\n"How far does the pilot go with the ship?"\r\n\r\nTo different distances, they said.  Some pilots would go as far as\r\nHolyhead for the chance of the homeward-bound vessels; others only\r\ntook the ships over the Banks.  Some captains were more cautious\r\nthan others, and the pilots had different ways.  The wind was\r\nagainst the homeward-bound vessels, so perhaps the pilot aboard the\r\nJohn Cropper would not care to go far out.\r\n\r\n"How soon would he come back?"\r\n\r\nThere were three boatmen, and three opinions, varying from twelve\r\nhours to two days.  Nay, the man who gave his vote for the longest\r\ntime, on having his judgment disputed, grew stubborn, and doubled\r\nthe time, and thought it might be the end of the week before the\r\npilot-boat came home.\r\n\r\nThey began disputing and urging reasons; and Mary tried to\r\nunderstand them; but independently of their nautical language, a\r\nveil seemed drawn over her mind, and she had no clear perception of\r\nanything that passed.  Her very words seemed not her own, and beyond\r\nher power of control, for she found herself speaking quite\r\ndifferently to what she meant.\r\n\r\nOne by one her hopes had fallen away, and left her desolate; and\r\nthough a chance yet remained, she could no longer hope.  She felt\r\ncertain it, too, would fade and vanish.  She sank into a kind of\r\nstupor.  All outward objects harmonised with her despair--the gloomy\r\nleaden sky--the deep dark waters below, of a still heavier shade of\r\ncolour--the cold, flat yellow shore in the distance, which no ray\r\nlightened up--the nipping, cutting wind.\r\n\r\nShe shivered with her depression of mind and body.\r\n\r\nThe sails were taken down, of course, on the return to Liverpool,\r\nand the progress they made, rowing and tacking, was very slow.  The\r\nmen talked together, disputing about the pilots at first, and then\r\nabout matters of local importance, in which Mary would have taken no\r\ninterest at any time, and she gradually became drowsy; irrepressibly\r\nso, indeed, for in spite of her jerking efforts to keep awake, she\r\nsank away to the bottom of the boat, and there lay crouched on a\r\nrough heap of sails, rope, and tackles of various kinds.\r\n\r\nThe measured beat of the waters against the sides of the boat, and\r\nthe musical boom of the more distant waves, were more lulling than\r\nsilence, and she slept sound.\r\n\r\nOnce she opened her eyes heavily, and dimly saw the old grey, rough\r\nboatman (who had stood out the most obstinately for the full fare)\r\ncovering her with his thick pea-jacket.  He had taken it off on\r\npurpose, and was doing it tenderly in his way, but before she could\r\nrouse herself up to thank him she had dropped off to sleep again.\r\n\r\nAt last, in the dusk of evening, they arrived at the landing-place\r\nfrom which they had started some hours before.  The men spoke to\r\nMary, but though she mechanically replied, she did not stir; so, at\r\nlength, they were obliged to shake her.  She stood up, shivering and\r\npuzzled as to her whereabouts.\r\n\r\n"Now tell me where you are bound to, missus," said the grey old man,\r\n"and maybe I can put you in the way."\r\n\r\nShe slowly comprehended what he said, and went through the process\r\nof recollection; but very dimly, and with much labour.  She put her\r\nhand into her pocket and pulled out her purse, and shook its\r\ncontents into the man\'s hand; and then began meekly to unpin her\r\nshawl, although they had turned away without asking for it.\r\n\r\n"No! no!" said the old man, who lingered on the step before\r\nspringing into the boat, and to whom she mutely offered the shawl.\r\n"Keep it! we donnot want it.  It were only for to try you,--some\r\nfolks say they\'ve no more blunt, when all the while they\'ve getten a\r\nmint."\r\n\r\n"Thank you," said she, in a dull, low tone.\r\n\r\n"Where are you bound to?  I axed that question afore," said the\r\ngruff old fellow.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know.  I\'m a stranger," replied she quietly, with a strange\r\nabsence of anxiety under the circumstances.\r\n\r\n"But you mun find out then," said he sharply: "pier-head\'s no\r\nplace for a young woman to be standing on, gapeseying."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve a card somewhere as will tell me," she answered, and the man,\r\npartly relieved, jumped into the boat, which was now pushing off to\r\nmake way for the arrivals from some steamer.\r\n\r\nMary felt in her pocket for the card, on which was written the name\r\nof the street where she was to have met Mr. Bridgnorth at two\r\no\'clock; where Job and Mrs. Wilson were to have been, and where she\r\nwas to have learnt from the former the particulars of some\r\nrespectable lodging.  It was not to be found.\r\n\r\nShe tried to brighten her perceptions, and felt again, and took out\r\nthe little articles her pocket contained, her empty purse, her\r\npocket-handkerchief, and such little things, but it was not there.\r\n\r\nIn fact, she had dropped it when, so eager to embark, she had pulled\r\nout her purse to reckon up her money.\r\n\r\nShe did not know this, of course.  She only knew it was gone.\r\n\r\nIt added but little to the despair that was creeping over her.  But\r\nshe tried a little more to help herself, though every minute her\r\nmind became more cloudy.  She strove to remember where Will had\r\nlodged, but she could not; name, street, everything had passed away,\r\nand it did not signify; better she were lost than found.\r\n\r\nShe sat down quietly on the top step of the landing, and gazed down\r\ninto the dark, dank water below.  Once or twice a spectral thought\r\nloomed among the shadows of her brain; a wonder whether beneath that\r\ncold dismal surface there would not be rest from the troubles of\r\nearth.  But she could not hold an idea before her for two\r\nconsecutive moments; and she forgot what she thought about before\r\nshe could act upon it.\r\n\r\nSo she continued sitting motionless, without looking up, or\r\nregarding in any way the insults to which she was subjected.\r\n\r\nThrough the darkening light the old boatman had watched her:\r\ninterested in her in spite of himself, and his scoldings of himself.\r\n\r\nWhen the landing-place was once more comparatively clear, he made\r\nhis way towards it, across boats, and along planks, swearing at\r\nhimself while he did so for an old fool.\r\n\r\nHe shook Mary\'s shoulder violently.\r\n\r\n"D--- you, I ask you again where you\'re bound to?  Don\'t sit there,\r\nstupid.  Where are going to?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," sighed Mary.\r\n\r\n"Come, come; avast with that story.  You said a bit ago you\'d a\r\ncard, which was to tell you where to go."\r\n\r\n"I had, but I\'ve lost it.  Never mind."\r\n\r\nShe looked again down upon the black mirror below.\r\n\r\nHe stood by her, striving to put down his better self; but he could\r\nnot.  He shook her again.  She looked up, as if she had forgotten\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"What do you want?" asked she wearily.\r\n\r\n"Come with me and be d--d to you!" replied he, clutching her arm to\r\npull her up.\r\n\r\nShe arose and followed him, with the unquestioning docility of a\r\nlittle child.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIX.   A TRUE BILL AGAINST JEM.\r\n\r\n     "There are who, living by the legal pen,\r\n      Are held in honour--honourable men."\r\n                                     --CRABBE.\r\n\r\nAt five minutes before two, Job Legh stood upon the doorstep of the\r\nhouse where Mr. Bridgnorth lodged at Assize time.  He had left Mrs.\r\nWilson at the dwelling of a friend of his, who had offered him a\r\nroom for the old woman and Mary: a room which had frequently been\r\nhis, on his occasional visits to Liverpool, but which he was\r\nthankful now to have obtained for them, as his own sleeping place\r\nwas a matter of indifference to him, and the town appeared crowded\r\nand disorderly on the eve of the Assizes.\r\n\r\nHe was shown in to Mr. Bridgnorth, who was writing; Mary and Will\r\nWilson had not yet arrived, being, as you know, far away on the\r\nbroad sea; but of this Job of course knew nothing, and he did not as\r\nyet feel much anxiety about their non-appearance; he was more\r\ncurious to know the result of Mr. Bridgnorth\'s interview that\r\nmorning with Jem.\r\n\r\n"Why, yes," said Mr. Bridgnorth, putting down his pen, "I have seen\r\nhim, but to little purpose, I\'m afraid.  He\'s very impracticable--\r\nvery.  I told him, of course, that he must be perfectly open with\r\nme, or else I could not be prepared for the weak points.  I named\r\nyour name with the view of unlocking his confidence, but"--\r\n\r\n"What did he say?" asked Job breathlessly.\r\n\r\n"Why, very little.  He barely answered me.  Indeed, he refused to\r\nanswer some questions--positively refused.  I don\'t know what I can\r\ndo for him."\r\n\r\n"Then you think him guilty, sir?" said Job despondingly.\r\n\r\n"No, I don\'t," replied Mr. Bridgnorth, quickly and decisively.\r\n"Much less than I did before I saw him.  The impression (mind, \'t is\r\nonly impression; I rely upon your caution, not to take it for fact)--\r\nthe impression," with an emphasis on the word, "he gave me is, that\r\nhe knows something about the affair, but what, he will not say; and\r\nso the chances are, if he persists in his obstinacy, he\'ll be hung.\r\nThat\'s all."\r\n\r\nHe began to write again, for he had no time to lose.\r\n\r\n"But he must not be hung," said Job with vehemence.\r\n\r\nMr. Bridgnorth looked up, smiled a little, but shook his head.\r\n\r\n"What did he say, sir, if I may be so bold as to ask?" continued\r\nJob.\r\n\r\n"His words were few enough, and he was so reserved and short, that,\r\nas I said before, I can only give you the impression they conveyed\r\nto me.  I told him, of course, who I was, and for what I was sent.\r\nHe looked pleased, I thought--at least his face (sad enough when I\r\nwent in, I assure ye) brightened a little; but he said he had\r\nnothing to say, no defence to make.  I asked him if he was guilty,\r\nthen; and, by way of opening his heart, I said I understood he had\r\nhad provocation enough, inasmuch as I heard that the girl was very\r\nlovely and had jilted him to fall desperately in love with that\r\nhandsome young Carson (poor fellow!).  But James Wilson did not\r\nspeak one way or another.  I then went to particulars.  I asked him\r\nif the gun was his, as his mother had declared.  He had not heard of\r\nher admission, it was evident, from his quick way of looking up, and\r\nthe glance of his eye; but when he saw I was observing him, he hung\r\ndown his head again, and merely said she was right; it was his gun."\r\n\r\n"Well!" said Job impatiently, as Mr. Bridgnorth paused.\r\n\r\n"Nay!  I have little more to tell you," continued that gentleman.\r\n"I asked him to inform me, in all confidence, how it came to be\r\nfound there.  He was silent for a time, and then refused.  Not only\r\nrefused to answer that question, but candidly told me he would not\r\nsay another word on the subject, and, thanking me for my trouble and\r\ninterest in his behalf, he all but dismissed me.  Ungracious enough\r\non the whole, was it not, Mr. Legh?  And yet, I assure ye, I am\r\ntwenty times more inclined to think him innocent than before I had\r\nthe interview."\r\n\r\n"I wish Mary Barton would come," said Job anxiously.  "She and Will\r\nare a long time about it."\r\n\r\n"Ay, that\'s our only chance, I believe," answered Mr. Bridgnorth,\r\nwho was writing again.  "I sent Johnson off before twelve to serve\r\nhim with his sub-poena, and to say I wanted to speak with him; he\'ll\r\nbe here soon, I\'ve no doubt."\r\n\r\nThere was a pause.  Mr. Bridgnorth looked up again, and spoke.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Duncombe promised to be here to speak to his character.  I sent\r\nhim a sub-poena on Saturday night.  Though, after all, juries go\r\nvery little by such general and vague testimony as that to\r\ncharacter.  It is very right that they should not often; but in this\r\ninstance unfortunate for us, as we must rest our case on the alibi."\r\n\r\nThe pen went again, scratch, scratch over the paper.\r\n\r\nJob grew very fidgety.  He sat on the edge of his chair, the more\r\nreadily to start up when Will and Mary should appear.  He listened\r\nintently to every noise and every step on the stair.\r\n\r\nOnce he heard a man\'s footstep, and his old heart gave a leap of\r\ndelight.  But it was only Mr. Bridgnorth\'s clerk, bringing him a\r\nlist of those cases in which the grand jury had found true bills.\r\nHe glanced it over and pushed it to Job, merely saying--\r\n\r\n"Of course we expected this," and went on with his writing.\r\n\r\nThere was a true bill against James Wilson, of course.  And yet Job\r\nfelt now doubly anxious and sad.  It seemed the beginning of the\r\nend.  He had got, by imperceptible degrees, to think Jem innocent.\r\nLittle by little this persuasion had come upon him.\r\n\r\nMary (tossing about in the little boat on the broad river) did not\r\ncome, nor did Will.\r\n\r\nJob grew very restless.  He longed to go and watch for them out of\r\nthe window, but feared to interrupt Mr. Bridgnorth.  At length his\r\ndesire to look out was irresistible, and he got up and walked\r\ncarefully and gently across the room, his boots creaking at every\r\ncautious step.  The gloom which had overspread the sky, and the\r\ninfluence of which had been felt by Mary on the open water, was yet\r\nmore perceptible in the dark, dull street.  Job grew more and more\r\nfidgety.  He was obliged to walk about the room, for he could not\r\nkeep still; and he did so, regardless of Mr. Bridgnorth\'s impatient\r\nlittle motions and noises, as the slow, stealthy, creaking movements\r\nwere heard, backwards and forwards, behind his chair.\r\n\r\nHe really liked Job, and was interested for Jem, else his\r\nnervousness would have overcome his sympathy long before it did.\r\nBut he could hold out no longer against the monotonous, grating\r\nsound; so at last he threw down his pen, locked his portfolio, and\r\ntaking up his hat and gloves, he told Job he must go to the courts.\r\n\r\n"But Will Wilson is not come," said Job in dismay.  "Just wait while\r\nI run to his lodgings.  I would have done it before, but I thought\r\nthey\'d be here every minute, and I were afraid of missing them.\r\nI\'ll be back in no time."\r\n\r\n"No, my good fellow, I really must go.  Besides, I begin to think\r\nJohnson must have made a mistake, and have fixed with this William\r\nWilson to meet me at the courts.  If you like to wait for him here,\r\npray make use of my room; but I\'ve a notion I shall find him there:\r\nin which case, I\'ll send him to your lodging; shall I?  You know\r\nwhere to find me.  I shall be here again by eight o\'clock, and with\r\nthe evidence of this witness that\'s to prove the alibi, I\'ll have\r\nthe brief drawn out, and in the hands of counsel to-night."\r\n\r\nSo saying he shook hands with Job, and went his way.  The old man\r\nconsidered for a minute as he lingered at the door, and then bent\r\nhis steps towards Mrs. Jones\'s, where he knew (from reference to\r\nqueer, odd, heterogeneous memoranda, in an ancient black-leather\r\npocket-book) that Will lodged, and where he doubted not he should\r\nhear both of him and of Mary.\r\n\r\nHe went there, and gathered what intelligence he could out of Mrs.\r\nJones\'s slow replies.\r\n\r\nHe asked if a young woman had been there that morning, and if she\r\nhad seen Will Wilson.  "No!"\r\n\r\n"Why not?"\r\n\r\n"Why, bless you, \'cause he had sailed some hours before she came\r\nasking for him."\r\n\r\nThere was a dead silence, broken only by the even, heavy sound of\r\nMrs. Jones\'s ironing.\r\n\r\n"Where is the young woman now?" asked Job.\r\n\r\n"Somewhere down at the docks," she thought.  "Charley would know, if\r\nhe was in, but he wasn\'t.  He was in mischief, somewhere or other,\r\nshe had no doubt.  Boys always were.  He would break his neck some\r\nday, she knew"; so saying, she quietly spat upon her fresh iron, to\r\ntest its heat, and then went on with her business.\r\n\r\nJob could have boxed her, he was in such a state of irritation.  But\r\nhe did not, and he had his reward.  Charley came in, whistling with\r\nan air of indifference, assumed to carry off his knowledge of the\r\nlateness of the hour to which he had lingered about the docks.\r\n\r\n"Here\'s an old man come to know where the young woman is who went\r\nout with thee this morning," said his mother, after she had bestowed\r\non him a little motherly scolding.\r\n\r\n"Where she is now I don\'t know.  I saw her last sailing down the\r\nriver after the John Cropper.  I\'m afeard she won\'t reach her; wind\r\nchanged, and she would be under weigh, and over the bar in no time.\r\nShe would have been back by now."\r\n\r\nIt took Job some little time to understand this, from the confused\r\nuse of the feminine pronoun.  Then he inquired how he could best\r\nfind Mary.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll run down again to the pier," said the boy; "I\'ll warrant I\'ll\r\nfind her."\r\n\r\n"Thou shalt do no such a thing," said his mother, setting her back\r\nagainst the door.  The lad made a comical face at Job, which met\r\nwith no responsive look from the old man, whose sympathies were\r\nnaturally in favour of the parent: although he would thankfully\r\nhave availed himself of Charley\'s offer; for he was weary, and\r\nanxious to return to poor Mrs. Wilson, who would be wondering what\r\nhad become of him.\r\n\r\n"How can I best find her?  Who did she go with, lad?"\r\n\r\nBut Charley was sullen at his mother\'s exercise of authority before\r\na stranger, and at that stranger\'s grave looks when he meant to have\r\nmade him laugh.\r\n\r\n"They were river boatmen;--that\'s all I know," said he.\r\n\r\n"But what was the name of their boat?" persevered Job.\r\n\r\n"I never took no notice; the Anne, or William,--or some of them\r\ncommon names, I\'ll be bound."\r\n\r\n"What pier did she start from?" asked Job despairingly.\r\n\r\n"Oh, as for that matter, it were the stairs on the Prince\'s Pier she\r\nstarted from; but she\'ll not come back to the same, for the American\r\nsteamer came up with the tide, and anchored close to it, blocking up\r\nthe way for all the smaller craft.  It\'s a rough evening, too, to be\r\nout on," he maliciously added.\r\n\r\n"Well, God\'s will be done!  I did hope we could have saved the lad,"\r\nsaid Job sorrowfully; "but I\'m getten very doubtful again.  I\'m\r\nuneasy about Mary, too,--very.  She\'s a stranger in Liverpool."\r\n\r\n"So she told me," said Charley.  "There\'s traps about for young\r\nwomen at every corner.  It\'s a pity she\'s no one to meet her when\r\nshe lands."\r\n\r\n"As for that," replied Job, "I don\'t see how any one could meet her\r\nwhen we can\'t tell where she would come to.  I must trust to her\r\ncoming right.  She\'s getten spirit and sense.  She\'ll most likely be\r\nfor coming here again.  Indeed, I don\'t know what else she can do,\r\nfor she knows no other place in Liverpool.  Missus, if she comes,\r\nwill you give your son leave to bring her to No. 8, Back Garden\r\nCourt, where there\'s friends waiting for her?  I\'ll give him\r\nsixpence for his trouble."\r\n\r\nMrs. Jones, pleased with the reference to her, gladly promised.  And\r\neven Charley, indignant as he was at first at the idea of his\r\nmotions being under the control of his mother, was mollified at the\r\nprospect of the sixpence, and at the probability of getting nearer\r\nto the heart of the mystery.\r\n\r\nBut Mary never came.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXX.   JOB LEGH\'S DECEPTION.\r\n\r\n  "Oh! sad is the night-time,\r\n     The night-time of sorrow,\r\n   When through the deep gloom, we catch but the boom\r\n     Of the waves that may whelm us to-morrow."\r\n\r\nJob found Mrs. Wilson pacing about in a restless way; not speaking\r\nto the woman at whose house she was staying, but occasionally\r\nheaving such deep oppressive sighs as quite startled those around\r\nher.\r\n\r\n"Well!" said she, turning sharp round in her tottering walk up and\r\ndown as Job came in.\r\n\r\n"Well, speak!" repeated she, before he could make up his mind what\r\nto say; for, to tell the truth, he was studying for some kind-\r\nhearted lie which might soothe her for a time.  But now the real\r\nstate of the case came blurting forth in answer to her impatient\r\nquestioning.\r\n\r\n"Will\'s not to the fore.  But he\'ll maybe turn up yet, time enough."\r\n\r\nShe looked at him steadily for a minute, as if almost doubting if\r\nsuch despair could be in store for her as his words seemed to imply.\r\nThen she slowly shook her head, and said, more quietly than might\r\nhave been expected from her previous excited manner--\r\n\r\n"Don\'t go for to say that!  Thou dost not think it.  Thou\'rt well-\r\nnigh hopeless, like me.  I seed all along my lad would be hung for\r\nwhat he never did.  And better he were, and were shut* of this weary\r\nworld, where there\'s neither justice nor mercy left."\r\n\r\n     *Shut; quit.\r\n\r\nShe looked up with tranced eyes as if praying, and then sat down.\r\n\r\n"Nay, now thou\'rt off at a gallop," said Job.  "Will has sailed this\r\nmorning, for sure; but that brave wench, Mary Barton, is after him,\r\nand will bring him back, I\'ll be bound, if she can but get speech on\r\nhim.  She\'s not back yet.  Come, come, hold up thy head.  It will\r\nall end right."\r\n\r\n"It will all end right," echoed she; "but not as thou tak\'st it.\r\nJem will be hung, and will go to his father and the little lads,\r\nwhere the Lord God wipes away all tears, and where the Lord Jesus\r\nspeaks kindly to the little ones, who look about for the mothers\r\nthey left upon earth.  Eh, Job, yon\'s a blessed land, and I long to\r\ngo to it, and yet I fret because Jem is hastening there.  I would\r\nnot fret if he and I could lie down to-night to sleep our last\r\nsleep; not a bit would I fret if folk would but know him to be\r\ninnocent--as I do."\r\n\r\n"They\'ll know it sooner or later, and repent sore if they\'ve hanged\r\nhim for what he never did," replied Job.\r\n\r\n"Ay, that they will.  Poor souls!  May God have mercy on them when\r\nthey find out their mistake."\r\n\r\nPresently Job grew tired of sitting waiting, and got up, and hung\r\nabout the door and window, like some animal wanting to go out.  It\r\nwas pitch dark, for the moon had not yet risen.\r\n\r\n"You just go to bed," said he to the widow; "you\'ll want your\r\nstrength for to-morrow.  Jem will be sadly off, if he sees you so\r\ncut up as you look to-night.  I\'ll step down again and find Mary.\r\nShe\'ll be back by this time.  I\'ll come and tell you everything,\r\nnever fear.  But now, you go to bed."\r\n\r\n"Thou\'rt a kind friend, Job Legh, and I\'ll go, as thou wishest me.\r\nBut, oh! mind thou com\'st straight off to me, and bring Mary as soon\r\nas thou\'st lit on her."  She spoke low, but very calmly.\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay!" replied Job, slipping out of the house.\r\n\r\nHe went first to Mr. Bridgnorth\'s, where it had struck him that Will\r\nand Mary might be all this time waiting for him.\r\n\r\nThey were not there, however.  Mr. Bridgnorth had just come in, and\r\nJob went breathlessly upstairs to consult with him as to the state\r\nof the case.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a bad job," said the lawyer, looking very grave, while he\r\narranged his papers.  "Johnson told me how it was; the woman that\r\nWilson lodged with told him.  I doubt it\'s but a wildgoose chase of\r\nthe girl Barton.  Our case must rest on the uncertainty of\r\ncircumstantial evidence, and the goodness of the prisoner\'s previous\r\ncharacter.  A very vague and weak defence.  However, I\'ve engaged\r\nMr. Clinton as counsel, and he\'ll make the best of it.  And now, my\r\ngood fellow, I must wish you good-night, and turn you out of doors.\r\nAs it is, I shall have to sit up into the small hours.  Did you see\r\nmy clerk as you came upstairs?  You did!  Then may I trouble you to\r\nask him to step up immediately?"\r\n\r\nAfter this Job could not stay, and, making his humble bow, he left\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\nThen he went to Mrs. Jones\'s.  She was in, but Charley had slipped\r\noff again.  There was no holding that boy.  Nothing kept him but\r\nlock and key, and they did not always; for once she had him locked\r\nup in the garret, and he had got off through the skylight.  Perhaps\r\nnow he was gone to see after the young woman down at the docks.  He\r\nnever wanted an excuse to be there.\r\n\r\nUnasked, Job took a chair, resolved to wait Charley\'s reappearance.\r\n\r\nMrs. Jones ironed and folded her clothes, talking all the time of\r\nCharley and her husband, who was a sailor in some ship bound for\r\nIndia, and who, in leaving her their boy, had evidently left her\r\nrather more than she could manage.  She moaned and croaked over\r\nsailors, and seaport towns, and stormy weather, and sleepless\r\nnights, and trousers all over tar and pitch, long after Job had left\r\noff attending to her, and was only trying to hearken to every step\r\nand every voice in the street.\r\n\r\nAt last Charley came in, but he came alone.\r\n\r\n"Yon Mary Barton has getten into some scrape or another," said he,\r\naddressing himself to Job.  "She\'s not to be heard of at any of the\r\npiers; and Bourne says it were a boat from the Cheshire side as she\r\nwent aboard of.  So there\'s no hearing of her till to-morrow\r\nmorning."\r\n\r\n"To-morrow morning she\'ll have to be in court at nine o\'clock, to\r\nbear witness on a trial," said Job sorrowfully.\r\n\r\n"So she said; at least somewhat of the kind," said Charley, looking\r\ndesirous to hear more.  But Job was silent.\r\n\r\nHe could not think of anything further that could be done; so he\r\nrose up, and, thanking Mrs. Jones for the shelter she had given him,\r\nhe went out into the street; and there he stood still, to ponder\r\nover probabilities and chances.\r\n\r\nAfter some little time he slowly turned towards the lodging where he\r\nhad left Mrs. Wilson.  There was nothing else to be done; but he\r\nloitered on the way, fervently hoping that her weariness and her\r\nwoes might have sent her to sleep before his return, that he might\r\nbe spared her questionings.\r\n\r\nHe went very gently into the house-place where the sleepy landlady\r\nawaited his coming and his bringing the girl, who, she had been\r\ntold, was to share the old woman\'s bed.\r\n\r\nBut in her sleepy blindness she knocked things so about in lighting\r\nthe candle (she could see to have a nap by firelight, she said),\r\nthat the voice of Mrs. Wilson was heard from the little back-room,\r\nwhere she was to pass the night.\r\n\r\n"Who\'s there?"\r\n\r\nJob gave no answer, and kept down his breath, that she might think\r\nherself mistaken.  The landlady, having no such care, dropped the\r\nsnuffers with a sharp metallic sound, and then, by her endless\r\napologies, convinced the listening woman that Job had returned.\r\n\r\n"Job!  Job Legh!" she cried out nervously.\r\n\r\n"Eh, dear!" said Job to himself, going reluctantly to her bedroom\r\ndoor.  "I wonder if one little lie would be a sin, as things stand?\r\nIt would happen give her sleep, and she won\'t have sleep for many\r\nand many a night (not to call sleep), if things goes wrong\r\nto-morrow.  I\'ll chance it, any way."\r\n\r\n"Job! art thou there?" asked she again with a trembling impatience\r\nthat told in every tone of her voice.\r\n\r\n"Ay! sure!  I thought thou\'d ha\' been asleep by this time."\r\n\r\n"Asleep!  How could I sleep till I know\'d if Will were found?"\r\n\r\n"Now for it," muttered Job to himself.  Then in a louder voice,\r\n"Never fear! he\'s found, and safe, ready for to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"And he\'ll prove that thing for my poor lad, will he?  He\'ll bear\r\nwitness that Jem were with him?  O Job, speak! tell me all!"\r\n\r\n"In for a penny, in for a pound," thought Job.  "Happen one prayer\r\nwill do for the sum total.  Any rate, I must go on now.  Ay, ay,"\r\nshouted he, through the door.  "He can prove all; and Jem will come\r\noff as clear as a new-born babe."\r\n\r\nHe could hear Mrs. Wilson\'s rustling movements, and in an instant\r\nguessed she was on her knees, for he heard her trembling voice\r\nuplifted in thanksgiving and praise to God, stopped at times by sobs\r\nof gladness and relief.\r\n\r\nAnd when he heard this, his heart misgave him; for he thought of the\r\nawful enlightening, the terrible revulsion of feeling that awaited\r\nher in the morning.  He saw the shortsightedness of falsehood; but\r\nwhat could he do now?\r\n\r\nWhile he listened, she ended her grateful prayers.\r\n\r\n"And Mary?  Thou\'st found her at Mrs. Jones\'s, Job?" said she,\r\ncontinuing her inquiries.\r\n\r\nHe gave a great sigh.\r\n\r\n"Yes, she was there, safe enough, second time of going.  God forgive\r\nme!" muttered he, "who\'d ha\' thought of my turning out such an\r\narrant liar in my old days."\r\n\r\n"Bless the wench!  Is she here?  Why does she not come to bed?  I\'m\r\nsure she\'s need."\r\n\r\nJob coughed away his remains of conscience, and made answer--\r\n\r\n"She was a bit weary, and o\'erdone with her sail! and Mrs. Jones\r\naxed her to stay there all night.  It was nigh at hand to the\r\ncourts, where she will have to be in the morning."\r\n\r\n"It comes easy enough after a while," groaned out Job.  "The father\r\nof lies helps one, I suppose, for now my speech comes as natural as\r\ntruth.  She\'s done questioning now, that\'s one good thing.  I\'ll be\r\noff, before Satan and she are at me again."\r\n\r\nHe went to the house-place, where the landlady stood wearily\r\nwaiting.  Her husband was in bed, and asleep long ago.\r\n\r\nBut Job had not yet made up his mind what to do.  He could not go to\r\nsleep, with all his anxieties, if he were put into the best bed in\r\nLiverpool.\r\n\r\n"Thou\'lt let me sit up in this arm-chair," said he at length to the\r\nwoman, who stood, expecting his departure.\r\n\r\nHe was an old friend, so she let him do as he wished.  But, indeed,\r\nshe was too sleepy to have opposed him.  She was too glad to be\r\nreleased and go to bed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXI.   HOW MARY PASSED THE NIGHT.\r\n\r\n                                     "To think\r\n      That all this long interminable night,\r\n      Which I have passed in thinking on two words--\r\n      \'Guilty\'--\'Not Guilty!\'--like one happy moment\r\n      O\'er many a head hath flown unheeded by;\r\n      O\'er happy sleepers dreaming in their bliss\r\n      Of bright to-morrows--or far happier still,\r\n      With deep breath buried in forgetfulness.\r\n      O all the dismallest images of death\r\n      Did swim before my eyes!"\r\n                                      --WILSON.\r\n\r\nAnd now, where was Mary?\r\n\r\nHow Job\'s heart would have been relieved of one of its cares if he\r\ncould have seen her: for he was in a miserable state of anxiety\r\nabout her; and many and many a time through that long night he\r\nscolded her and himself; her for her obstinacy, and himself for his\r\nweakness in yielding to her obstinacy, when she insisted on being\r\nthe one to follow and find out Will.\r\n\r\nShe did not pass that night in bed any more than Job; but she was\r\nunder a respectable roof, and among kind, though rough people.\r\n\r\nShe had offered no resistance to the old boatman, when he had\r\nclutched her arm, in order to insure her following him, as he\r\nthreaded the crowded dock-ways, and dived up strange by-streets.\r\nShe came on meekly after him, scarcely thinking in her stupor where\r\nshe was going, and glad (in a dead, heavy way) that some one was\r\ndeciding things for her.\r\n\r\nHe led her to an old-fashioned house, almost as small as house could\r\nbe, which had been built long ago, before all the other part of the\r\nstreet, and had a country-town look about it in the middle of that\r\nbustling back-street.  He pulled her into the house-place; and\r\nrelieved to a certain degree of his fear of losing her on the way,\r\nhe exclaimed--\r\n\r\n"There!" giving a great slap of one hand on her back.\r\n\r\nThe room was light and bright, and roused Mary (perhaps the slap on\r\nher back might help a little too), and she felt the awkwardness of\r\naccounting for her presence to a little bustling old woman who had\r\nbeen moving about the fireplace on her entrance.  The boatman took\r\nit very quietly, never deigning to give any explanation, but sitting\r\ndown in his own particular chair, and chewing tobacco, while he\r\nlooked at Mary with the most satisfied air imaginable, half\r\ntriumphantly, as if she were the captive of his bow and spear, and\r\nhalf defying, as if daring her to escape.\r\n\r\nThe old woman, his wife, stood still, poker in hand, waiting to\r\nbe told who it was that her husband had brought home so\r\nunceremoniously; but, as she looked in amazement, the girl\'s cheek\r\nflushed, and then blanched to a dead whiteness; a film came over her\r\neyes, and catching at the dresser for support in that hot whirling\r\nroom, she fell in a heap on the floor.\r\n\r\nBoth man and wife came quickly to her assistance.  They raised her\r\nup, still insensible, and he supported her on one knee, while his\r\nwife pattered away for some cold fresh water.  She threw it straight\r\nover Mary; but though it caused a great sob, the eyes still remained\r\nclosed, and the face as pale as ashes.\r\n\r\n"Who is she, Ben?" asked the woman, as she rubbed her unresisting,\r\npowerless hands.\r\n\r\n"How should I know?" answered her husband gruffly.\r\n\r\n"Well-a-well!" (in a soothing tone, such as you use to irritated\r\nchildren), and as if half to herself, "I only thought you might, you\r\nknow, as you brought her home.  Poor thing! we must not ask aught\r\nabout her, but that she needs help.  I wish I\'d my salts at home,\r\nbut I lent \'em to Mrs. Burton, last Sunday in church, for she could\r\nnot keep awake through the sermon.  Dear-a-me, how white she is!"\r\n\r\n"Here! you hold her up a bit," said her husband.\r\n\r\nShe did as he desired, still crooning to herself, not caring for his\r\nshort, sharp interruptions as she went on; and, indeed, to her old,\r\nloving heart, his crossest words fell like pearls and diamonds, for\r\nhe had been the husband of her youth; and even he, rough and crabbed\r\nas he was, was secretly soothed by the sound of her voice, although\r\nnot for worlds, if he could have helped it, would he have shown any\r\nof the love that was hidden beneath his rough outside.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the old fellow after?" said she, bending over Mary, so as to\r\naccommodate the drooping head.  "Taking my pen, as I\'ve had for\r\nbetter nor five year.  Bless us, and save us! he\'s burning it!  Ay,\r\nI see now, he\'s his wits about him; burnt feathers is always good\r\nfor a faint.  But they don\'t bring her round, poor wench!  Now\r\nwhat\'s he after next?  Well! he is a bright one, my old man!  That I\r\nnever thought of that, to be sure!" exclaimed she, as he produced a\r\nsquare bottle of smuggled spirits, labelled "Golden Wasser," from a\r\ncorner cupboard in their little room.\r\n\r\n"That\'ll do!" said she, as the dose he poured into Mary\'s open mouth\r\nmade her start and cough.  "Bless the man.  It\'s just like him to be\r\nso tender and thoughtful!"\r\n\r\n"Not a bit!" snarled he, as he was relieved by Mary\'s returning\r\ncolour, and opened eyes, and wondering, sensible gaze; "not a bit.\r\nI never was such a fool afore."\r\n\r\nHis wife helped Mary to rise, and placed her in a chair.\r\n\r\n"All\'s right, now, young woman?" asked the boatman anxiously.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir, and thank you.  I\'m sure, sir, I don\'t know rightly how\r\nto thank you," faltered Mary softly forth.\r\n\r\n"Be hanged to you and your thanks."  And he shook himself, took his\r\npipe, and went out without deigning another word; leaving his wife\r\nsorely puzzled as to the character and history of the stranger\r\nwithin her doors.\r\n\r\nMary watched the boatman leave the house, and then, turning her\r\nsorrowful eyes to the face of her hostess, she attempted feebly to\r\nrise, with the intention of going away,--where she knew not.\r\n\r\n"Nay! nay! whoe\'er thou be\'st, thou\'rt not fit to go out into the\r\nstreet.  Perhaps" (sinking her voice a little) "thou\'rt a bad one; I\r\nalmost misdoubt thee, thou\'rt so pretty.  Well-a-well! it\'s the bad\r\nones as have the broken hearts, sure enough; good folk never get\r\nutterly cast down, they\'ve always getten hope in the Lord; it\'s the\r\nsinful as bear the bitter, bitter grief in their crushed hearts,\r\npoor souls; it\'s them we ought, most of all, to pity and help.  She\r\nshanna leave the house to-night, choose who she is--worst woman in\r\nLiverpool, she shanna.  I wished I knew where th\' old man picked her\r\nup, that I do."\r\n\r\nMary had listened feebly to this soliloquy, and now tried to satisfy\r\nher hostess in weak, broken sentences.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not a bad one, missis, indeed.  Your master took me out to see\r\nafter a ship as had sailed.  There was a man in it as might save a\r\nlife at the trial to-morrow.  The captain would not let him come,\r\nbut he says he\'ll come back in the pilot-boat."  She fell to sobbing\r\nat the thought of her waning hopes, and the old woman tried to\r\ncomfort her, beginning with her accustomed--\r\n\r\n"Well-a-well! and he\'ll come back, I\'m sure.  I know he will; so\r\nkeep up your heart.  Don\'t fret about it.  He\'s sure to be back."\r\n\r\n"Oh! I\'m afraid!  I\'m sore afraid he won\'t," cried Mary, consoled,\r\nnevertheless, by the woman\'s assertions, all groundless as she knew\r\nthem to be.\r\n\r\nStill talking half to herself and half to Mary, the old woman\r\nprepared tea, and urged her visitor to eat and refresh herself.  But\r\nMary shook her head at the proffered food, and only drank a cup of\r\ntea with thirsty eagerness.  For the spirits had thrown her into a\r\nburning heat, and rendered each impression received through her\r\nsenses of the most painful distinctness and intensity, while her\r\nhead ached in a terrible manner.\r\n\r\nShe disliked speaking, her power over her words seemed so utterly\r\ngone.  She used quite different expressions to those she intended.\r\nSo she kept silent, while Mrs. Sturgis (for that was the name of her\r\nhostess) talked away, and put her tea-things by, and moved about\r\nincessantly, in a manner that increased the dizziness in Mary\'s\r\nhead.  She felt as if she ought to take leave for the night and go.\r\nBut where?\r\n\r\nPresently the old man came back, crosser and gruffer than when he\r\nwent away.  He kicked aside the dry shoes his wife had prepared for\r\nhim, and snarled at all she said.  Mary attributed this to his\r\nfinding her still there, and gathered up her strength for an effort\r\nto leave the house.  But she was mistaken.  By-and-by, he said\r\n(looking right into the fire, as if addressing it), "Wind\'s right\r\nagainst them!"\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay, and is it so?" said his wife, who, knowing him well, knew\r\nthat his surliness proceeded from some repressed sympathy.\r\n"Well-a-well, wind changes often at night.  Time enough before\r\nmorning.  I\'d bet a penny it has changed sin\' thou looked."\r\n\r\nShe looked out of her little window at a weathercock near,\r\nglittering in the moonlight; and as she was a sailor\'s wife, she\r\ninstantly recognised the unfavourable point at which the indicator\r\nseemed stationary, and giving a heavy sigh, turned into the room,\r\nand began to beat about in her own mind for some other mode of\r\ncomfort.\r\n\r\n"There\'s no one else who can prove what you want at the trial\r\nto-morrow, is there?" asked she.\r\n\r\n"No one!" answered Mary.\r\n\r\n"And you\'ve no clue to the one as is really guilty, if t\'other is\r\nnot?"\r\n\r\nMary did not answer, but trembled all over.\r\n\r\nSturgis saw it.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t bother her with thy questions," said he to his wife.  "She\r\nmun go to bed, for she\'s all in a shiver with the sea-air.  I\'ll see\r\nafter the wind, hang it, and the weathercock too.  Tide will help\r\n\'em when it turns."\r\n\r\nMary went upstairs murmuring thanks and blessings on those who took\r\nthe stranger in.  Mrs. Sturgis led her into a little room redolent\r\nof the sea and foreign lands.  There was a small bed for one son\r\nbound for China; and a hammock slung above for another, who was now\r\ntossing in the Baltic.  The sheets looked made out of sail-cloth,\r\nbut were fresh and clean in spite of their brownness.\r\n\r\nAgainst the wall were wafered two rough drawings of vessels with\r\ntheir names written underneath, on which the mother\'s eyes caught,\r\nand gazed until they filled with tears.  But she brushed the drops\r\naway with the back of her hand, and in a cheerful tone went on to\r\nassure Mary the bed was well aired.\r\n\r\n"I cannot sleep, thank you.  I will sit here, if you please," said\r\nMary, sinking down on the window-seat.\r\n\r\n"Come, now," said Mrs. Sturgis, "my master told me to see you to\r\nbed, and I mun.  What\'s the use of watching?  A watched pot never\r\nboils, and I see you are after watching that weathercock.  Why now,\r\nI try never to look at it, else I could do nought else.  My heart\r\nmany a time goes sick when the wind rises, but I turn away and work\r\naway, and try never to think on the wind, but on what I ha\' getten\r\nto do."\r\n\r\n"Let me stay up a little," pleaded Mary, as her hostess seemed so\r\nresolute about seeing her to bed.\r\n\r\nHer looks won her suit.\r\n\r\n"Well, I suppose I mun.  I shall catch it downstairs, I know.  He\'ll\r\nbe in a fidget till you\'re getten to bed, I know; so you mun be\r\nquiet if you are so bent upon staying up."\r\n\r\nAnd quietly, noiselessly, Mary watched the unchanging weathercock\r\nthrough the night.  She sat on the little window seat, her hand\r\nholding back the curtain which shaded the room from the bright\r\nmoonlight without; her head resting its weariness against the corner\r\nof the window-frame; her eyes burning and stiff with the intensity\r\nof her gaze.\r\n\r\nThe ruddy morning stole up the horizon, casting a crimson glow into\r\nthe watcher\'s room.\r\n\r\nIt was the morning of the day of trial!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXII.   THE TRIAL AND VERDICT--"NOT GUILTY."\r\n\r\n                         "Thou stand\'st here arraign\'d,\r\n      That with presumption impious and accurs\'d,\r\n      Thou hast usurp\'d God\'s high prerogative,\r\n      Making thy fellow mortal\'s life and death\r\n      Wait on thy moody and diseased passions;\r\n      That with a violent and untimely steel\r\n      Hath set abroach the blood that should have ebbed\r\n      In calm and natural current: to sum all\r\n      In one wild name--a name the pale air freezes at,\r\n      And every cheek of man sinks in with horror--\r\n      Thou art a cold and midnight murderer."\r\n                                  --MILMAN\'S "FAZIO."\r\n\r\nOf all the restless people who found that night\'s hours agonising\r\nfrom excess of anxiety, the poor father of the murdered man was\r\nperhaps the most restless.  He had slept but little since the blow\r\nhad fallen; his waking hours had been too full of agitated thought,\r\nwhich seemed to haunt and pursue him through his unquiet slumbers.\r\n\r\nAnd this night of all others was the most sleepless.  He turned over\r\nand over again in his mind the wonder if everything had been done,\r\nthat could be done, to insure the conviction of Jem Wilson.  He\r\nalmost regretted the haste with which he had urged forward the\r\nproceedings, and yet, until he had obtained vengeance, he felt as if\r\nthere was no peace on earth for him (I don\'t know that he exactly\r\nused the term vengeance in his thoughts; he spoke of justice, and\r\nprobably thought of his desired end as such); no peace, either\r\nbodily or mental, for he moved up and down his bedroom with the\r\nrestless incessant tramp of a wild beast in a cage, and if he\r\ncompelled his aching limbs to cease for an instant, the twitchings\r\nwhich ensued almost amounted to convulsions, and he recommenced his\r\nwalk as the lesser evil, and the more bearable fatigue.\r\n\r\nWith daylight increased power of action came; and he drove off to\r\narouse his attorney, and worry him with further directions and\r\ninquiries; and when that was ended, he sat, watch in hand, until the\r\ncourts should be opened, and the trial begin.\r\n\r\nWhat were all the living,--wife or daughters,--what were they in\r\ncomparison with the dead, the murdered son who lay unburied still,\r\nin compliance with his father\'s earnest wish, and almost vowed\r\npurpose, of having the slayer of his child sentenced to death,\r\nbefore he committed the body to the rest of the grave?\r\n\r\nAt nine o\'clock they all met at their awful place of rendezvous.\r\n\r\nThe judge, the jury, the avenger of blood, the prisoner, the\r\nwitnesses--all were gathered together within the building.  And\r\nbesides these were many others, personally interested in some part\r\nof the proceedings, in which, however, they took no part; Job Legh,\r\nBen Sturgis, and several others were there, amongst whom was Charley\r\nJones.\r\n\r\nJob Legh had carefully avoided any questioning from Mrs. Wilson that\r\nmorning.  Indeed, he had not been much in her company, for he had\r\nrisen up early to go out once more to make inquiry for Mary; and\r\nwhen he could hear nothing of her, he had desperately resolved not\r\nto undeceive Mrs. Wilson, as sorrow never came too late; and if the\r\nblow were inevitable, it would be better to leave her in ignorance\r\nof the impending evil as long as possible, She took her place in the\r\nwitness-room, worn and dispirited, but not anxious.\r\n\r\nAs Job struggled through the crowd into the body of the court, Mr.\r\nBridgnorth\'s clerk beckoned to him.\r\n\r\n"Here\'s a letter for you from our client!"\r\n\r\nJob sickened as he took it.  He did not know why, but he dreaded a\r\nconfession of guilt, which would be an overthrow of all hope.\r\n\r\nThe letter ran as follows:--\r\n\r\n"DEAR FRIEND,--I thank you heartily for your goodness in finding me\r\na lawyer, but lawyers can do no good to me, whatever they may do to\r\nother people.  But I am not the less obliged to you, dear friend.  I\r\nforesee things will go against me--and no wonder.  If I was a\r\njuryman I should say the man was guilty as had as much evidence\r\nbrought against him as may be brought against me tomorrow.  So it\'s\r\nno blame to them if they do.  But, Job Legh, I think I need not tell\r\nyou I am as guiltless in this matter as the babe unborn, although it\r\nis not in my power to prove it.  If I did not believe that you\r\nthought me innocent, I could not write as I do now to tell you my\r\nwishes.  You\'ll not forget they are the words of a man shortly to\r\ndie.  Dear friend, you must take care of my mother.  Not in the\r\nmoney way, for she will have enough for her and Aunt Alice; but you\r\nmust let her talk to you of me; and show her that (whatever others\r\nmay do) you think I died innocent.  I don\'t reckon she\'ll stay long\r\nbehind when we are all gone.  Be tender with her, Job, for my sake;\r\nand if she is a bit fractious at times, remember what she has gone\r\nthrough.  I know mother will never doubt me, God bless her.\r\n\r\n"There is one other whom I fear I have loved too dearly; and yet,\r\nthe loving her has made the happiness of my life.  She will think I\r\nhave murdered her lover: she will think I have caused the grief\r\nshe must be feeling.  And she must go on thinking so.  It is hard\r\nupon me to say this; but she MUST.  It will be best for her, and\r\nthat\'s all I ought to think on.  But, dear Job, you are a hearty\r\nfellow for your time of life, and may live many years to come; and\r\nperhaps you could tell her, when you felt sure you were drawing near\r\nyour end, that I solemnly told you (as I do now) that I was innocent\r\nof this thing.  You must not tell her for many years to come: but\r\nI cannot well bear to think on her living through a long life, and\r\nhating the thought of me as the murderer of him she loved, and dying\r\nwith that hatred to me in her heart.  It would hurt me sore in the\r\nother world to see the look of it in her face, as it would be, till\r\nshe was told.  I must not let myself think on how she must be\r\nviewing me now.\r\n\r\n"So God bless you, Job Legh; and no more from yours to command,\r\n\r\n                                     "JAMES WILSON."\r\n\r\nJob turned the letter over and over when he had read it; sighed\r\ndeeply; and then wrapping it carefully up in a bit of newspaper he\r\nhad about him, he put it in his waistcoat pocket, and went off to\r\nthe door of the witness-room to ask if Mary Barton was there.\r\n\r\nAs the door opened he saw her sitting within, against a table on\r\nwhich her folded arms were resting, and her head was hidden within\r\nthem.  It was an attitude of hopelessness, and would have served to\r\nstrike Job dumb in sickness of heart, even without the sound of Mrs.\r\nWilson\'s voice in passionate sobbing, and sore lamentations, which\r\ntold him as well as words could do (for she was not within view of\r\nthe door, and he did not care to go in), that she was at any rate\r\npartially undeceived as to the hopes he had given her last night.\r\n\r\nSorrowfully did Job return into the body of the court; neither Mrs.\r\nWilson nor Mary having seen him as he had stood at the witness-room\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he could bring his distracted thoughts to bear upon the\r\npresent scene, he perceived that the trial of James Wilson for the\r\nmurder of Henry Carson was just commencing.  The clerk was gabbling\r\nover the indictment, and in a minute or two there was the accustomed\r\nquestion, "How say you, Guilty or Not Guilty?"\r\n\r\nAlthough but one answer was expected,--was customary in all\r\ncases,--there was a pause of dead silence, an interval of solemnity\r\neven in this hackneyed part of the proceeding; while the prisoner at\r\nthe bar stood with compressed lips, looking at the judge with his\r\noutward eyes, but with far other and different scenes presented to\r\nhis mental vision; a sort of rapid recapitulation of his\r\nlife,--remembrances of his childhood,--his father (so proud of him,\r\nhis first-born child),--his sweet little playfellow, Mary,--his\r\nhopes, his love, his despair,--yet still, yet ever and ever, his\r\nlove,--the blank, wide world it had been without her love,--his\r\nmother,--his childless mother,--but not long to be so,--not long to\r\nbe away from all she loved,--nor during that time to be oppressed\r\nwith doubt as to his innocence, sure and secure of her darling\'s\r\nheart;--he started from his instant\'s pause, and said in a low firm\r\nvoice\r\n\r\n"Not guilty, my lord."\r\n\r\nThe circumstances of the murder, the discovery of the body, the\r\ncauses of suspicion against Jem, were as well known to most of the\r\naudience as they are to you, so there was some little buzz of\r\nconversation going on among the people while the leading counsel for\r\nthe prosecution made his very effective speech.\r\n\r\n"That\'s Mr. Carson, the father, sitting behind Serjeant Wilkinson!"\r\n\r\n"What a noble-looking old man he is! so stern and inflexible, with\r\nsuch classical features!  Does he not remind you of some of the\r\nbusts of Jupiter?"\r\n\r\n"I am more interested by watching the prisoner.  Criminals always\r\ninterest me.  I try to trace in the features common to humanity some\r\nexpression of the crimes by which they have distinguished themselves\r\nfrom their kind.  I have seen a good number of murderers in my day,\r\nbut I have seldom seen one with such marks of Cain on his\r\ncountenance as the man at the bar."\r\n\r\n"Well, I am no physiognomist, but I don\'t think his face strikes me\r\nas bad.  It certainly is gloomy and depressed, and not unnaturally\r\nso, considering his situation."\r\n\r\n"Only look at his low, resolute brow, his downcast eye, his white\r\ncompressed lips.  He never looks up,--just watch him."\r\n\r\n"His forehead is not so low if he had that mass of black hair\r\nremoved, and is very square, which some people say is a good sign.\r\nIf others are to be influenced by such trifles as you are, it would\r\nhave been much better if the prison barber had cut his hair a little\r\nprevious to the trial; and as for downcast eye, and compressed lip,\r\nit is all part and parcel of his inward agitation just now; nothing\r\nto do with character, my good fellow."\r\n\r\nPoor Jem!  His raven hair (his mother\'s pride, and so often fondly\r\ncaressed by her fingers), was that, too, to have its influence\r\nagainst him?\r\n\r\nThe witnesses were called.  At first they consisted principally of\r\npolicemen; who, being much accustomed to giving evidence, knew what\r\nwere the material points they were called on to prove, and did not\r\nlose the time of the court in listening to anything unnecessary.\r\n\r\n"Clear as day against the prisoner," whispered one attorney\'s clerk\r\nto another.\r\n\r\n"Black as night, you mean," replied his friend; and they both\r\nsmiled.\r\n\r\n"Jane Wilson! who\'s she? some relation, I suppose, from the name."\r\n\r\n"The mother,--she that is to prove the gun part of the case."\r\n\r\n"Oh, ay--I remember!  Rather hard on her, too, I think."\r\n\r\nThen both were silent, as one of the officers of the court ushered\r\nMrs. Wilson into the witness-box.  I have often called her "the old\r\nwoman," and "an old woman," because, in truth, her appearance was so\r\nmuch beyond her years, which could not be many above fifty.  But\r\npartly owing to her accident in early life, which left a stamp of\r\npain upon her face, partly owing to her anxious temper, partly to\r\nher sorrows, and partly to her limping gait, she always gave me the\r\nidea of age.  But now she might have seemed more than seventy; her\r\nlines were so set and deep, her features so sharpened, and her walk\r\nso feeble.  She was trying to check her sobs into composure, and\r\n(unconsciously) was striving to behave as she thought would best\r\nplease her poor boy, whom she knew she had often grieved by her\r\nuncontrolled impatience.  He had buried his face in his arms, which\r\nrested on the front of the dock (an attitude he retained during the\r\ngreater part of his trial, and which prejudiced many against him).\r\n\r\nThe counsel began the examination.\r\n\r\n"Your name is Jane Wilson, I believe?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir."\r\n\r\n"The mother of the prisoner at the bar?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir," with quivering voice, ready to break out into weeping,\r\nbut earning respect by the strong effort at self-control, prompted,\r\nas I have said before, by her earnest wish to please her son by her\r\nbehaviour.\r\n\r\nThe barrister now proceeded to the important part of the\r\nexamination, tending to prove that the gun found on the scene of the\r\nmurder was the prisoner\'s.  She had committed herself so fully to\r\nthe policeman, that she could not well retract; so without much\r\ndelay in bringing the question round to the desired point, the gun\r\nwas produced in court, and the inquiry made--\r\n\r\n"That gun belongs to your son, does it not?"\r\n\r\nShe clenched the sides of the witness-box in her efforts to make her\r\nparched tongue utter words.  At last she moaned forth--\r\n\r\n"Oh! Jem, Jem! what mun I say?"\r\n\r\nEvery one bent forward to hear the prisoner\'s answer; although, in\r\nfact, it was of little importance to the issue of the trial.  He\r\nlifted up his head; and with a face brimming full of pity for his\r\nmother, yet resolved into endurance, said--\r\n\r\n"Tell the truth, mother!"\r\n\r\nAnd so she did, with the fidelity of a little child.  Every one felt\r\nthat she did; and the little colloquy between mother and son did\r\nthem some slight service in the opinion of the audience.  But the\r\nawful judge sat unmoved; and the jurymen changed not a muscle of\r\ntheir countenances; while the counsel for the prosecution went\r\ntriumphantly through this part of the case, including the fact of\r\nJem\'s absence from home on the night of the murder, and bringing\r\nevery admission to bear right against the prisoner.\r\n\r\nIt was over.  She was told to go down.  But she could no longer\r\ncompel her mother\'s heart to keep silence, and suddenly turning\r\ntowards the judge (with whom she imagined the verdict to rest), she\r\nthus addressed him with her choking voice--\r\n\r\n"And now, sir, I\'ve telled you the truth, and the whole truth, as he\r\nbid me; but don\'t you let what I have said go for to hang him; oh,\r\nmy lord judge, take my word for it, he\'s as innocent as the child as\r\nhas yet to be born.  For sure, I, who am his mother, and have nursed\r\nhim on my knee, and been gladdened by the sight of him every day\r\nsince, ought to know him better than yon pack of fellows"\r\n(indicating the jury, while she strove against her heart to render\r\nher words distinct and clear for her dear son\'s sake), "who, I\'ll go\r\nbail, never saw him before this morning in all their born days.  My\r\nlord judge, he\'s so good I often wondered what harm there was in\r\nhim; many is the time when I\'ve been fretted (for I\'m frabbit enough\r\nat times), when I\'ve scold\'t myself, and said: \'You ungrateful\r\nthing, the Lord God has given you Jem, and isn\'t that blessing\r\nenough for you?\'  But He has seen fit to punish me.  If Jem is--if\r\nJem is--taken from me, I shall be a childless woman; and very poor,\r\nhaving nought left to love on earth, and I cannot say \'His will be\r\ndone.\'  I cannot, my lord judge, oh, I cannot."\r\n\r\nWhile sobbing out these words she was led away by the officers of\r\nthe court, but tenderly, and reverently, with the respect which\r\ngreat sorrow commands.\r\n\r\nThe stream of evidence went on and on, gathering fresh force from\r\nevery witness who was examined, and threatening to overwhelm poor\r\nJem.  Already they had proved that the gun was his, that he had been\r\nheard not many days before the commission of the deed to threaten\r\nthe deceased; indeed, that the police had, at that time, been\r\nobliged to interfere, to prevent some probable act of violence.  It\r\nonly remained to bring forward a sufficient motive for the threat\r\nand the murder.  The clue to this had been furnished by the\r\npoliceman, who had overheard Jem\'s angry language to Mr. Carson; and\r\nhis report in the first instance had occasioned the sub-poena to\r\nMary.\r\n\r\nAnd now she was to be called on to bear witness.  The court was by\r\nthis time almost as full as it could hold; but fresh attempts were\r\nbeing made to squeeze in at all the entrances, for many were anxious\r\nto see and hear this part of the trial.\r\n\r\nOld Mr. Carson felt an additional beat at his heart at the thought\r\nof seeing the fatal Helen, the cause of all,--a kind of interest and\r\nyet repugnance, for was not she beloved by the dead; nay, perhaps,\r\nin her way, loving and mourning for the same being that he himself\r\nwas so bitterly grieving over?  And yet he felt as if he abhorred\r\nher and her rumoured loveliness, as if she were the curse against\r\nhim; and he grew jealous of the love with which she had inspired his\r\nson, and would fain have deprived her of even her natural right of\r\nsorrowing over her lover\'s untimely end: for you see it was a\r\nfixed idea in the minds of all, that the handsome, bright, gay, rich\r\nyoung gentleman must have been beloved in preference to the serious,\r\nalmost stern-looking smith, who had to toil for his daily bread.\r\n\r\nHitherto the effect of the trial had equalled Mr. Carson\'s most\r\nsanguine hopes, and a severe look of satisfaction came over the face\r\nof the avenger,--over that countenance whence the smile had\r\ndeparted, never more to return.\r\n\r\nAll eyes were directed to the door through which the witnesses\r\nentered.  Even Jem looked up to catch one glimpse before he hid his\r\nface from her look of aversion.  The officer had gone to fetch her.\r\n\r\nShe was in exactly the same attitude as when Job Legh had seen her\r\ntwo hours before through the half-open door.  Not a finger had\r\nmoved.  The officer summoned her, but she did not stir.  She was so\r\nstill, he thought she had fallen asleep, and he stepped forward and\r\ntouched her.  She started up in an instant, and followed him with a\r\nkind of rushing rapid motion into the court, into the witness-box.\r\n\r\nAnd amid all that sea of faces, misty and swimming before her eyes,\r\nshe saw but two clear bright spots, distinct and fixed: the judge,\r\nwho might have to condemn; and the prisoner, who might have to die.\r\n\r\nThe mellow sunlight streamed down that high window on her head, and\r\nfell on the rich treasure of her golden hair, stuffed away in masses\r\nunder her little bonnet-cap; and in those warm beams the motes kept\r\ndancing up and down.  The wind had changed--had changed almost as\r\nsoon as she had given up her watching; the wind had changed, and she\r\nheeded it not.\r\n\r\nMany who were looking for mere flesh and blood beauty, mere\r\ncolouring, were disappointed; for her face was deadly white, and\r\nalmost set in its expression, while a mournful bewildered soul\r\nlooked out of the depths of those soft, deep, grey eyes.  But others\r\nrecognised a higher and a stranger kind of beauty; one that would\r\nkeep its hold on the memory for many after years.\r\n\r\nI was not there myself; but one who was, told me that her look, and\r\nindeed her whole face, was more like the well-known engraving from\r\nGuido\'s picture of "Beatrice Cenci" than anything else he could give\r\nme an idea of.  He added, that her countenance haunted him, like the\r\nremembrance of some wild sad melody, heard in childhood; that it\r\nwould perpetually recur with its mute imploring agony.\r\n\r\nWith all the court reeling before her (always save and except those\r\nawful two), she heard a voice speak, and answered the simple inquiry\r\n(something about her name) mechanically, as if in a dream.  So she\r\nwent on for two or three more questions, with a strange wonder in\r\nher brain, at the reality of the terrible circumstances in which she\r\nwas placed.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she was roused, she knew not how or by what.  She was\r\nconscious that all was real, that hundreds were looking at her, that\r\ntrue-sounding words were being extracted from her; that that figure,\r\nso bowed down, with the face concealed with both hands, was really\r\nJem.  Her face flushed scarlet, and then, paler than before.  But in\r\ndread of herself, with the tremendous secret imprisoned within her,\r\nshe exerted every power she had to keep in the full understanding of\r\nwhat was going on, of what she was asked, and of what she answered.\r\nWith all her faculties preternaturally alive and sensitive, she\r\nheard the next question from the pert young barrister, who was\r\ndelighted to have the examination of this witness.\r\n\r\n"And pray, may I ask, which was the favoured lover?  You say you\r\nknew both these young men.  Which was the favoured lover?  Which did\r\nyou prefer?"\r\n\r\nAnd who was he, the questioner, that he should dare so lightly to\r\nask of her heart\'s secrets?  That he should dare to ask her to tell,\r\nbefore that multitude assembled there, what woman usually whispers\r\nwith blushes and tears, and many hesitations, to one ear alone?\r\n\r\nSo, for an instant, a look of indignation contracted Mary\'s brow, as\r\nshe steadily met the eyes of the impertinent counsellor.  But, in\r\nthat instant, she saw the hands removed from a face beyond, behind;\r\nand a countenance revealed of such intense love and woe,--such a\r\ndeprecating dread of her answer; and suddenly her resolution was\r\ntaken.  The present was everything; the future, that vast shroud, it\r\nwas maddening to think upon; but NOW she might own her fault, but\r\nNOW she might even own her love.  Now, when the beloved stood thus,\r\nabhorred of men, there would be no feminine shame to stand between\r\nher and her avowal.  So she also turned towards the judge, partly to\r\nmark that her answer was not given to the monkeyfied man who\r\nquestioned her, and likewise that the face might be averted from,\r\nand her eyes not gaze upon, the form that contracted with the dread\r\nof the words he anticipated.\r\n\r\n"He asks me which of them two I liked best.  Perhaps I liked Mr.\r\nHarry Carson once--I don\'t know--I\'ve forgotten; but I loved James\r\nWilson, that\'s now on trial, above what tongue can tell--above all\r\nelse on earth put together; and I love him now better than ever,\r\nthough he has never known a word of it till this minute.  For you\r\nsee, sir, mother died before I was thirteen, before I could know\r\nright from wrong about some things; and I was giddy and vain, and\r\nready to listen to any praise of my good looks; and this poor young\r\nMr. Carson fell in with me, and told me he loved me; and I was\r\nfoolish enough to think he meant me marriage: a mother is a\r\npitiful loss to a girl, sir: and so I used to fancy I could like\r\nto be a lady, and rich, and never know want any more.  I never found\r\nout how dearly I loved another till one day, when James Wilson asked\r\nme to marry him, and I was very hard and sharp in my answer (for\r\nindeed, sir, I\'d a deal to bear just then), and he took me at my\r\nword and left me; and from that day to this I\'ve never spoken a word\r\nto him, or set eyes on him; though I\'d fain have done so, to try and\r\nshow him we had both been too hasty; for he\'d not been gone out of\r\nmy sight above a minute before I knew I loved--far above my life,"\r\nsaid she, dropping her voice as she came to this second confession\r\nof the strength of her attachment.  "But, if the gentleman asks me\r\nwhich I loved the best, I make answer, I was flattered by Mr.\r\nCarson, and pleased with his flattery; but James Wilson, I--"\r\n\r\nShe covered her face with her hands, to hide the burning scarlet\r\nblushes, which even dyed her fingers.\r\n\r\nThere was a little pause; still, though her speech might inspire\r\npity for the prisoner, it only strengthened the supposition of his\r\nguilt.\r\n\r\nPresently the counsellor went on with his examination.\r\n\r\n"But you have seen young Mr. Carson since your rejection of the\r\nprisoner?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, often."\r\n\r\n"You have spoken to him, I conclude, at these times."\r\n\r\n"Only once, to call speaking."\r\n\r\n"And what was the substance of your conversation?  Did you tell him\r\nyou found you preferred his rival?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir.  I don\'t think as I\'ve done wrong in saying, now as things\r\nstand, what my feelings are; but I never would be so bold as to tell\r\none young man I cared for another.  I never named Jem\'s name to Mr.\r\nCarson.  Never."\r\n\r\n"Then what did you say when you had this final conversation with Mr.\r\nCarson?  You can give me the substance of it, if you don\'t remember\r\nthe words."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll try, sir; but I\'m not very clear.  I told him I could not love\r\nhim, and wished to have nothing more to do with him.  He did his\r\nbest to over-persuade me, but I kept steady, and at last I ran off."\r\n\r\n"And you never spoke to him again?"\r\n\r\n"Never!"\r\n\r\n"Now, young woman, remember you are upon your oath.  Did you ever\r\ntell the prisoner at the bar of Mr. Henry Carson\'s attentions to\r\nyou? of your acquaintance, in short?  Did you ever try to excite his\r\njealousy by boasting of a lover so far above you in station?"\r\n\r\n"Never.  I never did," said she, in so firm and distinct a manner as\r\nto leave no doubt.\r\n\r\n"Were you aware that he knew of Mr. Henry Carson\'s regard for you?\r\nRemember you are on your oath!"\r\n\r\n"Never, sir.  I was not aware until I heard of the quarrel between\r\nthem, and what Jem had said to the policeman, and that was after the\r\nmurder.  To this day I can\'t make out who told Jem.  O sir, may not\r\nI go down?"\r\n\r\nFor she felt the sense, the composure, the very bodily strength\r\nwhich she had compelled to her aid for a time, suddenly giving way,\r\nand was conscious that she was losing all command over herself.\r\nThere was no occasion to detain her longer; she had done her part.\r\nShe might go down.  The evidence was still stronger against the\r\nprisoner; but now he stood erect and firm, with self-respect in his\r\nattitude, and a look of determination on his face, which almost made\r\nit appear noble.  Yet he seemed lost in thought.\r\n\r\nJob Legh had all this time been trying to soothe and comfort Mrs.\r\nWilson, who would first be in the court, in order to see her\r\ndarling, and then, when her sobs became irrepressible, had to be led\r\nout into the open air, and sat there weeping, on the steps of the\r\ncourt-house.  Who would have taken charge of Mary, on her release\r\nfrom the witness-box, I do not know, if Mrs. Sturgis, the boatman\'s\r\nwife, had not been there, brought by her interest in Mary, towards\r\nwhom she now pressed, in order to urge her to leave the scene of the\r\ntrial.\r\n\r\n"No! no!" said Mary, to this proposition.  "I must be here.  I must\r\nwatch that they don\'t hang him, you know I must."\r\n\r\n"Oh! they\'ll not hang him! never fear!  Besides, the wind has\r\nchanged, and that\'s in his favour.  Come away.  You\'re so hot, and\r\nfirst white and then red; I\'m sure you\'re ill.  Just come away."\r\n\r\n"Oh! I don\'t know about anything but that I must stay," replied\r\nMary, in a strange hurried manner, catching hold of some rails as if\r\nshe feared some bodily force would be employed to remove her.  So\r\nMrs. Sturgis just waited patiently by her, every now and then\r\npeeping among the congregation of heads in the body of the court, to\r\nsee if her husband were still there.  And there he always was to be\r\nseen, looking and listening with all his might.  His wife felt easy\r\nthat he would not be wanting her at home until the trial was ended.\r\n\r\nMary never let go her clutched hold on the rails.  She wanted them\r\nto steady her, in that heaving, whirling court.  She thought the\r\nfeeling of something hard compressed within her hand would help her\r\nto listen, for it was such pain, such weary pain in her head, to\r\nstrive to attend to what was being said.  They were all at sea,\r\nsailing away on billowy waves, and every one speaking at once, and\r\nno one heeding her father, who was calling on them to be silent, and\r\nlisten to him.  Then again, for a brief second, the court stood\r\nstill, and she could see the judge, sitting up there like an idol,\r\nwith his trappings, so rigid and stiff; and Jem, opposite, looking\r\nat her, as if to say, Am I to die for what you know your--.  Then\r\nshe checked herself, and by a great struggle brought herself round\r\nto an instant\'s sanity.  But the round of thought never stood still;\r\nand off she went again; and every time her power of struggling\r\nagainst the growing delirium grew fainter and fainter.  She muttered\r\nlow to herself, but no one heard her except her neighbour, Mrs.\r\nSturgis; all were too closely attending to the case for the\r\nprosecution, which was now being wound up.\r\n\r\nThe counsel for the prisoner had avoided much cross-examination,\r\nreserving to himself the right of calling the witnesses forward\r\nagain; for he had received so little, and such vague instructions,\r\nand understood that so much depended on the evidence of one who was\r\nnot forthcoming, that in fact he had little hope of establishing\r\nanything like a show of a defence, and contented himself with\r\nwatching the case, and lying in wait for any legal objections that\r\nmight offer themselves.  He lay back on the seat, occasionally\r\ntaking a pinch of snuff in a manner intended to be contemptuous; now\r\nand then elevating his eyebrows, and sometimes exchanging a little\r\nnote with Mr. Bridgnorth behind him.  The attorney had far more\r\ninterest in the case than the barrister, to which he was perhaps\r\nexcited by his poor old friend Job Legh; who had edged and wedged\r\nhimself through the crowd close to Mr. Bridgnorth\'s elbow, sent\r\nthither by Ben Sturgis, to whom he had been "introduced" by Charley\r\nJones, and who had accounted for Mary\'s disappearance on the\r\npreceding day, and spoken of their chase, their fears, their hopes.\r\n\r\nAll this was told in a few words to Mr. Bridgnorth--so few, that\r\nthey gave him but a confused idea, that time was of value; and this\r\nhe named to his counsel, who now rose to speak for the defence.\r\n\r\nJob Legh looked about for Mary, now he had gained, and given, some\r\nidea of the position of things.  At last he saw her, standing by a\r\ndecent-looking woman, looking flushed and anxious, and moving her\r\nlips incessantly, as if eagerly talking; her eyes never resting on\r\nany object, but wandering about as if in search of something.  Job\r\nthought it was for him she was seeking, and he struggled to get\r\nround to her.  When he had succeeded, she took no notice of him,\r\nalthough he spoke to her, but still kept looking round and round in\r\nthe same wild, restless manner.  He tried to hear the low quick\r\nmutterings of her voice, as he caught the repetition of the same\r\nwords over and over again.\r\n\r\n"I must not go mad.  I must not, indeed.  They say people tell the\r\ntruth when they\'re mad; but I don\'t.  I was always a liar.  I was,\r\nindeed; but I\'m not mad.  I must not go mad.  I must not, indeed."\r\n\r\nSuddenly she seemed to become aware how earnestly Job was listening\r\n(with mournful attention) to her words, and turning sharp round upon\r\nhim, with upbraiding for his eavesdropping on her lips, she caught\r\nsight of something,--or some one,--who even in that state, had power\r\nto arrest her attention; and throwing up her arms with wild energy,\r\nshe shrieked aloud--\r\n\r\n"O Jem! Jem! you\'re saved; and I AM mad" and was instantly seized\r\nwith convulsions.  With much commiseration she was taken out of\r\ncourt, while the attention of many was diverted from her, by the\r\nfierce energy with which a sailor forced his way over rails and\r\nseats, against turnkeys and policemen.  The officers of the court\r\nopposed this forcible manner of entrance, but they could hardly\r\ninduce the offender to adopt any quieter way of attaining his\r\nobject, and telling his tale in the witness-box, the legitimate\r\nplace.  For Will had dwelt so impatiently on the danger in which his\r\nabsence would place his cousin, that even yet he seemed to fear that\r\nhe might see the prisoner carried off, and hung, before he could\r\npour out the narrative which would exculpate him.  As for Job Legh,\r\nhis feelings were all but uncontrollable; as you may judge by the\r\nindifference with which he saw Mary borne, stiff and convulsed, out\r\nof the court, in the charge of the kind Mrs. Sturgis, who, you will\r\nremember, was an utter stranger to him.\r\n\r\n"She\'ll keep!  I\'ll not trouble myself about her," said he to\r\nhimself, as he wrote with trembling hands a little note of\r\ninformation to Mr. Bridgnorth, who had conjectured, when Will had\r\nfirst disturbed the awful tranquillity of the life-and-death court,\r\nthat the witness had arrived (better late than never) on whose\r\nevidence rested all the slight chance yet remaining to Jem Wilson of\r\nescaping death.  During the commotion in the court, among all the\r\ncries and commands, the dismay and the directions, consequent upon\r\nWill\'s entrance, and poor Mary\'s fearful attack of illness, Mr.\r\nBridgnorth had kept his lawyer-like presence of mind; and long\r\nbefore Job Legh\'s almost illegible note was poked at him, he had\r\nrecapitulated the facts on which Will had to give evidence, and the\r\nmanner in which he had been pursued, after his ship had taken her\r\nleave of the land.\r\n\r\nThe barrister who defended Jem took new heart when he was put in\r\npossession of these striking points to be adduced, not so much out\r\nof earnestness to save the prisoner, of whose innocence he was still\r\ndoubtful, as because he saw the opportunities for the display of\r\nforensic eloquence which were presented by the facts; "a gallant tar\r\nbrought back from the pathless ocean by a girl\'s noble daring," "the\r\ndangers of too hastily judging from circumstantial evidence," etc.\r\netc.; while the counsellor for the prosecution prepared himself by\r\nfolding his arms, elevating his eyebrows, and putting his lips in\r\nthe form in which they might best whistle down the wind such\r\nevidence as might be produced by a suborned witness, who dared to\r\nperjure himself.  For, of course, it is etiquette to suppose that\r\nsuch evidence as may be given against the opinion which lawyers are\r\npaid to uphold, is anything but based on truth; and "perjury,"\r\n"conspiracy," and "peril of your immortal soul," are light\r\nexpressions to throw at the heads of those who may prove (not the\r\nspeaker, there would then be some excuse for the hasty words of\r\npersonal anger, but) the hirer of the speaker to be wrong, or\r\nmistaken.\r\n\r\nBut when once Will had attained his end, and felt that his tale, or\r\npart of a tale, would be heard by judge and jury; when once he saw\r\nJem standing safe and well before him (even though he saw him pale\r\nand careworn at the felons\' bar), his courage took the shape of\r\npresence of mind, and he awaited the examination with a calm,\r\nunflinching intelligence, which dictated the clearest and most\r\npertinent answers.  He told the story you know so well: how his\r\nleave of absence being nearly expired, he had resolved to fulfil his\r\npromise, and go to see an uncle residing in the Isle of Man; how his\r\nmoney (sailor-like) was all expended in Manchester, and how,\r\nconsequently, it had been necessary for him to walk to Liverpool,\r\nwhich he had accordingly done on the very night of the murder,\r\naccompanied as far as Hollins Green by his friend and cousin, the\r\nprisoner at the bar.  He was clear and distinct in every\r\ncorroborative circumstance, and gave a short account of the singular\r\nway in which he had been recalled from his outward-bound voyage, and\r\nthe terrible anxiety he had felt, as the pilot-boat had struggled\r\nhome against the wind.  The jury felt that their opinion (so nearly\r\ndecided half-an-hour ago) was shaken and disturbed in a very\r\nuncomfortable and perplexing way, and were almost grateful to the\r\ncounsel for the prosecution, when he got up, with a brow of thunder,\r\nto demolish the evidence, which was so bewildering when taken in\r\nconnection with everything previously adduced.  But if such, without\r\nlooking to the consequences, was the first impulsive feeling of some\r\namong the jury, how shall I describe the vehemence of passion which\r\npossessed the mind of poor Mr. Carson, as he saw the effect of the\r\nyoung sailor\'s statement?  It never shook his belief in Jem\'s guilt\r\nin the least, that attempt at an alibi; his hatred, his longing for\r\nvengeance, having once defined an object to itself, could no more\r\nbear to be frustrated and disappointed than the beast of prey can\r\nsubmit to have his victim taken from his hungry jaws.  No more\r\nlikeness to the calm stern power of Jupiter was there in that white\r\neager face, almost distorted by its fell anxiety of expression.\r\n\r\nThe counsel to whom etiquette assigned the cross-examination of\r\nWill, caught the look on Mr. Carson\'s face, and in his desire to\r\nfurther the intense wish there manifested, he over-shot his mark\r\neven in his first insulting question--\r\n\r\n"And now, my man, you\'ve told the court a very good and very\r\nconvincing story; no reasonable man ought to doubt the unstained\r\ninnocence of your relation at the bar.  Still there is one\r\ncircumstance you have forgotten to name; and I feel that without it\r\nyour evidence is rather incomplete.  Will you have the kindness to\r\ninform the gentlemen of the jury what has been your charge for\r\nrepeating this very plausible story?  How much good coin of Her\r\nMajesty\'s realm have you received, or are you to receive, for\r\nwalking up from the docks, or some less credible place, and uttering\r\nthe tale you have just now repeated,--very much to the credit of\r\nyour instructor, I must say?  Remember, sir, you are upon oath."\r\n\r\nIt took Will a minute to extract the meaning from the garb of\r\nunaccustomed words in which it was invested, and during this time he\r\nlooked a little confused.  But the instant the truth flashed upon\r\nhim he fixed his bright clear eyes, flaming with indignation, upon\r\nthe counsellor, whose look fell at last before that stern\r\nunflinching gaze.  Then, and not till then, Will made answer--\r\n\r\n"Will you tell the judge and jury how much money you\'ve been paid\r\nfor your impudence towards one who has told God\'s blessed truth, and\r\nwho would scorn to tell a lie, or blackguard any one, for the\r\nbiggest fee as ever lawyer got for doing dirty work?  Will you tell,\r\nsir?--But I\'m ready, my lord judge, to take my oath as many times as\r\nyour lordship or the jury would like, to testify to things having\r\nhappened just as I said.  There\'s O\'Brien, the pilot, in court now.\r\nWould somebody with a wig on please to ask him how much he can say\r\nfor me?"\r\n\r\nIt was a good idea, and caught at by the counsel for the defence.\r\nO\'Brien gave just such testimony as was required to clear Will from\r\nall suspicion.  He had witnessed the pursuit, he had heard the\r\nconversation which took place between the boat and the ship; he had\r\ngiven Will a homeward passage in his boat.  And the character of an\r\naccredited pilot, appointed by the Trinity House, was known to be\r\nabove suspicion.\r\n\r\nMr. Carson sank back on his seat in sickening despair.  He knew\r\nenough of courts to be aware of the extreme unwillingness of juries\r\nto convict, even where the evidence is most clear, when the penalty\r\nof such conviction is death.  At the period of the trial most\r\ncondemnatory to the prisoner, he had repeated this fact to himself,\r\nin order to damp his too certain expectation for a conviction.  Now\r\nit needed not repetition, for it forced itself upon his\r\nconsciousness, and he seemed to KNOW, even before the jury retired\r\nto consult, that by some trick, some negligence, some miserable\r\nhocus-pocus, the murderer of his child, his darling, his Absalom,\r\nwho had never rebelled--the slayer of his unburied boy would slip\r\nthrough the fangs of justice, and walk free and unscathed over that\r\nearth where his son would never more be seen.\r\n\r\nIt was even so.  The prisoner hid his face once more to shield the\r\nexpression of an emotion he could not control, from the notice of\r\nthe over-curious; Job Legh ceased his eager talking to Mr.\r\nBridgnorth; Charley looked grave and earnest; for the jury filed one\r\nby one back into their box, and the question was asked to which such\r\nan awful answer might be given.\r\n\r\nThe verdict they had come to was unsatisfactory to themselves at\r\nlast; neither being convinced of his innocence, nor yet quite\r\nwilling to believe him guilty in the teeth of the alibi.  But the\r\npunishment that awaited him, if guilty, was so terrible, and so\r\nunnatural a sentence for man to pronounce on man, that the knowledge\r\nof it had weighed down the scale on the side of innocence, and "Not\r\nGuilty" was the verdict that thrilled through the breathless court.\r\n\r\nOne moment of silence, and then the murmurs rose, as the verdict was\r\ndiscussed by all with lowered voice.  Jem stood motionless, his head\r\nbowed; poor fellow, he was stunned with the rapid career of events\r\nduring the last few hours.\r\n\r\nHe had assumed his place at the bar with little or no expectation of\r\nan acquittal; and with scarcely any desire for life, in the\r\ncomplication of occurrences tending to strengthen the idea of Mary\'s\r\nmore than indifference to him; she had loved another, and in her\r\nmind Jem believed that he himself must be regarded as the murderer\r\nof him she loved.  And suddenly, athwart this gloom which made life\r\nseem such a blank expanse of desolation, there flashed the exquisite\r\ndelight of hearing Mary\'s avowal of love, making the future all\r\nglorious, if a future in this world he might hope to have.  He could\r\nnot dwell on anything but her words, telling of her passionate love;\r\nall else was indistinct, nor could he strive to make it otherwise.\r\nShe loved him.\r\n\r\nAnd life, now full of tender images, suddenly bright with all\r\nexquisite promises, hung on a breath, the slenderest gossamer\r\nchance.  He tried to think that the knowledge of her love would\r\nsoothe him even in his dying hours; but the phantoms of what life\r\nwith her might be would obtrude, and made him almost gasp and reel\r\nunder the uncertainty he was enduring.  Will\'s appearance had only\r\nadded to the intensity of this suspense.\r\n\r\nThe full meaning of the verdict could not at once penetrate his\r\nbrain.  He stood dizzy and motionless.  Some one pulled his coat.\r\nHe turned, and saw Job Legh, the tears stealing down his brown\r\nfurrowed cheeks, while he tried in vain to command voice enough to\r\nspeak.  He kept shaking Jem by the hand, as the best and necessary\r\nexpression of his feeling.\r\n\r\n"Here, make yourself scarce!  I should think you\'d be glad to get\r\nout of that!" exclaimed the gaoler, as he brought up another livid\r\nprisoner, from out whose eyes came the anxiety which he would not\r\nallow any other feature to display.\r\n\r\nJob Legh pressed out of court, and Jem followed unreasoningly.\r\n\r\nThe crowd made way, and kept their garments tight about them, as Jem\r\npassed, for about him there still hung the taint of the murderer.\r\n\r\nHe was in the open air, and free once more!  Although many looked on\r\nhim with suspicion, faithful friends closed round him; his arm was\r\nunresistingly pumped up and down by his cousin and Job; when one was\r\ntired, the other took up the wholesome exercise, while Ben Sturgis\r\nwas working off his interest in the scene by scolding Charley for\r\nwalking on his head round and round Mary\'s sweetheart, for a\r\nsweetheart he was now satisfactorily ascertained to be, in spite of\r\nher assertion to the contrary.  And all this time Jem himself felt\r\nbewildered and dazzled; he would have given anything for an hour\'s\r\nuninterrupted thought on the occurrences of the past week, and the\r\nnew visions raised up during the morning; ay, even though that\r\ntranquil hour were to be passed in the hermitage of his quiet prison\r\ncell.  The first question sobbed out by his choking voice, oppressed\r\nwith emotion, was--\r\n\r\n"Where is she?"\r\n\r\nThey led him to the room where his mother sat.  They had told her of\r\nher son\'s acquittal, and now she was laughing, and crying, and\r\ntalking, and giving way to all those feelings which she had\r\nrestrained with such effort during the last few days.  They brought\r\nher son to her, and she threw herself upon his neck, weeping there.\r\nHe returned her embrace, but looked around, beyond.  Excepting his\r\nmother, there was no one in the room but the friends who had entered\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\n"Eh, lad!" she said, when she found voice to speak.  "See what it is\r\nto have behaved thysel!  I could put in a good word for thee, and\r\nthe jury could na go and hang thee in the face of th\' character I\r\ngave thee.  Was na it a good thing they did na keep me from\r\nLiverpool?  But I would come; I knew I could do thee good, bless\r\nthee, my lad.  But thou\'rt very white, and all of a tremble."\r\n\r\nHe kissed her again and again, but looking round as if searching for\r\nsome one he could not find, the first words he uttered were still--\r\n\r\n"Where is she?"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIII.   REQUIESCAT IN PACE.\r\n\r\n     "Fear no more the heat o\' th\' sun,\r\n        Nor the furious winter\'s rages;\r\n      Thou thy wordly task hast done,\r\n        Home art gone and ta\'en thy wages.\r\n                                  --Cymbeline.\r\n\r\n     "While day and night can bring delight,\r\n        Or nature aught of pleasure give;\r\n      While joys above my mind can move,\r\n        For thee, and thee alone I live:\r\n\r\n     "When that grim foe of joy below\r\n        Comes in between to make us part,\r\n      The iron hand that breaks our band,\r\n        It breaks my bliss--it breaks my heart."\r\n                                       --BURNS.\r\n\r\nShe was where no words of peace, no soothing hopeful tidings could\r\nreach her; in the ghastly spectral world of delirium.  Hour after\r\nhour, day after day, she started up with passionate cries on her\r\nfather to save Jem; or rose wildly, imploring the winds and waves,\r\nthe pitiless winds and waves, to have mercy; and over and over again\r\nshe exhausted her feverish fitful strength in these agonised\r\nentreaties, and fell back powerless, uttering only the wailing moans\r\nof despair.  They told her Jem was safe, they brought him before her\r\neyes; but sight and hearing were no longer channels of information\r\nto that poor distracted brain, nor could human voice penetrate to\r\nher understanding.\r\n\r\nJem alone gathered the full meaning of some of her strange\r\nsentences, and perceived that, by some means or other, she, like\r\nhimself, had divined the truth of her father being the murderer.\r\n\r\nLong ago (reckoning time by events and thoughts, and not by clock or\r\ndial-plate), Jem had felt certain that Mary\'s father was Harry\r\nCarson\'s murderer; and although the motive was in some measure a\r\nmystery, yet a whole train of circumstances (the principal of which\r\nwas that John Barton had borrowed the fatal gun only two days\r\nbefore) had left no doubt in Jem\'s mind.  Sometimes he thought that\r\nJohn had discovered, and thus bloodily resented, the attentions\r\nwhich Mr. Carson had paid to his daughter; at others, he believed\r\nthe motive to exist in the bitter feuds between the masters and\r\ntheir work-people, in which Barton was known to take so keen an\r\ninterest.  But if he had felt himself pledged to preserve this\r\nsecret, even when his own life was the probable penalty, and he\r\nbelieved he should fall execrated by Mary as the guilty destroyer of\r\nher lover, how much more was he bound now to labour to prevent any\r\nword of hers from inculpating her father, now that she was his own;\r\nnow that she had braved so much to rescue him; and now that her poor\r\nbrain had lost all guiding and controlling power over her words.\r\n\r\nAll that night long Jem wandered up and down the narrow precincts of\r\nBen Sturgis\'s house.  In the little bedroom where Mrs. Sturgis\r\nalternately tended Mary, and wept over the violence of her illness,\r\nhe listened to her ravings; each sentence of which had its own\r\npeculiar meaning and reference, intelligible to his mind, till her\r\nwords rose to the wild pitch of agony, that no one could alleviate,\r\nand he could bear it no longer, and stole, sick and miserable,\r\ndownstairs, where Ben Sturgis thought it his duty to snore away in\r\nan arm-chair instead of his bed, under the idea that he should thus\r\nbe more ready for active service, such as fetching the doctor to\r\nrevisit his patient.\r\n\r\nBefore it was fairly light, Jem (wide awake, and listening with an\r\nearnest attention he could not deaden, however painful its results\r\nproved) heard a gentle subdued knock at the house door; it was no\r\nbusiness of his, to be sure, to open it, but as Ben slept on, he\r\nthought he would see who the early visitor might be, and ascertain\r\nif there was any occasion for disturbing either host or hostess.  It\r\nwas Job Legh who stood there, distinct against the outer light of\r\nthe street.\r\n\r\n"How is she?  Eh! poor soul! is that her?  No need to ask!  How\r\nstrange her voice sounds!  Screech! screech! and she so low,\r\nsweet-spoken, when she\'s well!  Thou must keep up heart, old boy,\r\nand not look so dismal, thysel."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t help it, Job; it\'s past a man\'s bearing to hear such a one\r\nas she is, going on as she is doing; even if I did not care for her,\r\nit would cut me sore to see one so young, and--I can\'t speak of it,\r\nJob, as a man should do," said Jem, his sobs choking him.\r\n\r\n\r\n"Let me in, will you?" said Job, pushing past him, for all this time\r\nJem had stood holding the door, unwilling to admit Job where he\r\nmight hear so much that would be suggestive to one acquainted with\r\nthe parties that Mary named.\r\n\r\n"I\'d more than one reason for coming betimes.  I wanted to hear how\r\nyon poor wench was--that stood first.  Late last night I got a\r\nletter from Margaret, very anxious-like.  The doctor says the old\r\nlady yonder can\'t last many days longer, and it seems so lonesome\r\nfor her to die with no one but Margaret and Mrs. Davenport about\r\nher.  So I thought I\'d just come and stay with Mary Barton, and see\r\nas she\'s well done to, and you and your mother and Will go and take\r\nleave of old Alice."\r\n\r\nJem\'s countenance, sad at best just now, fell lower and lower.  But\r\nJob went on with his speech.\r\n\r\n"She still wanders, Margaret says, and thinks she\'s with her mother\r\nat home; but for all that, she should have some kith and kin near\r\nher to close her eyes, to my thinking."\r\n\r\n"Could not you and Will take mother home?  I\'d follow when"--Jem\r\nfaltered out thus far, when Job interrupted--\r\n\r\n"Lad! if thou knew what thy mother has suffered for thee, thou\'d not\r\nspeak of leaving her just when she\'s got thee from the grave as it\r\nwere.  Why, this very night she roused me up, and \'Job,\' says she,\r\n\'I ask your pardon for wakening you, but tell me, am I awake or\r\ndreaming?  Is Jem proved innocent?  O Job Legh!  God send I\'ve not\r\nbeen only dreaming it!\'  For thou see\'st she can\'t rightly\r\nunderstand why thou\'rt with Mary, and not with her.  Ay, ay!  I know\r\nwhy; but a mother only gives up her son\'s heart inch by inch to his\r\nwife, and then she gives it up with a grudge.  No, Jem! thou must go\r\nwith thy mother just now, if ever thou hopest for God\'s blessing.\r\nShe\'s a widow, and has none but thee.  Never fear for Mary!  She\'s\r\nyoung, and will struggle through.  They are decent people, these\r\nfolk she is with, and I\'ll watch o\'er her as though she was my own\r\npoor girl, that lies cold enough in London town.  I grant ye, it\'s\r\nhard enough for her to be left among strangers.  To my mind, John\r\nBarton would be more in the way of his duty, looking after his\r\ndaughter, than delegating it up and down the country, looking after\r\nevery one\'s business but his own."\r\n\r\nA new idea and a new fear came into Jem\'s mind.  What if Mary should\r\nimplicate her father?\r\n\r\n"She raves terribly," said he.  "All night long she\'s been speaking\r\nof her father, and mixing up thoughts of him with the trial she saw\r\nyesterday.  I should not wonder if she\'ll speak of him as being in\r\ncourt next thing."\r\n\r\n"I should na wonder, either," answered Job.  "Folk in her way say\r\nmany and many a strange thing; and th\' best way is never to mind\r\nthem.  Now you take your mother home, Jem, and stay by her till old\r\nAlice is gone, and trust me for seeing after Mary."\r\n\r\nJem felt how right Job was, and could not resist what he knew to be\r\nhis duty, but I cannot tell you how heavy and sick at heart he was\r\nas he stood at the door to take a last fond, lingering look at Mary.\r\nHe saw her sitting up in bed, her golden hair, dimmed with her one\r\nday\'s illness, floating behind her, her head bound round with wetted\r\ncloths, her features all agitated, even to distortion, with the\r\npangs of her anxiety.\r\n\r\nHer lover\'s eyes filled with tears.  He could not hope.  The\r\nelasticity of his heart had been crushed out of him by early\r\nsorrows; and now, especially, the dark side of everything seemed to\r\nbe presented to him.  What if she died, just when he knew the\r\ntreasure, the untold treasure he possessed in her love!  What if\r\n(worse than death) she remained a poor gibbering maniac all her life\r\nlong (and mad people do live to be old sometimes, even under all the\r\npressure of their burden), terror-distracted as she was now, and no\r\none able to comfort her!\r\n\r\n"Jem," said Job, partly guessing the other\'s feelings by his own.\r\n"Jem!" repeated he, arresting his attention before he spoke.  Jem\r\nturned round, the little motion causing the tears to overflow and\r\ntrickle down his cheeks.  "Thou must trust in God, and leave her in\r\nHis hands."  He spoke hushed, and low; but the words sank all the\r\nmore into Jem\'s heart, and gave him strength to tear himself away.\r\n\r\nHe found his mother (notwithstanding that she had but just regained\r\nher child through Mary\'s instrumentality) half inclined to resent\r\nhis having passed the night in anxious devotion to the poor invalid.\r\nShe dwelt on the duties of children to their parents (above all\r\nothers), till Jem could hardly believe the relative positions they\r\nhad held only yesterday, when she was struggling with and\r\ncontrolling every instinct of her nature, only because HE wished it.\r\nHowever, the recollection of that yesterday, with its hair\'s-breadth\r\nbetween him and a felon\'s death, and the love that had lightened the\r\ndark shadow, made him bear with the meekness and patience of a\r\ntrue-hearted man all the worrying little acerbities of to-day; and\r\nhe had no small merit in doing so; for in him, as in his mother, the\r\nreaction after intense excitement had produced its usual effect in\r\nincreased irritability of the nervous system.\r\n\r\nThey found Alice alive, and without pain.  And that was all.  A\r\nchild of a few weeks old would have had more bodily strength; a\r\nchild of a very few months old, more consciousness of what was\r\npassing before her.  But even in this state she diffused an\r\natmosphere of peace around her.  True, Will, at first, wept\r\npassionate tears at the sight of her, who had been as a mother to\r\nhim, so standing on the confines of life.  But even now, as always,\r\nloud passionate feeling could not long endure in the calm of her\r\npresence.  The firm faith which her mind had no longer power to\r\ngrasp, had left its trail of glory; for by no other word can I call\r\nthe bright happy look which illumined the old earth-worn face.  Her\r\ntalk, it is true, bore no more that constant earnest reference to\r\nGod and His holy Word which it had done in health, and there were no\r\ndeathbed words of exhortation from the lips of one so habitually\r\npious.  For still she imagined herself once again in the happy,\r\nhappy realms of childhood; and again dwelling in the lovely northern\r\nhaunts where she had so often longed to be.  Though earthly sight\r\nwas gone away, she beheld again the scenes she had loved from long\r\nyears ago! she saw them without a change to dim the old radiant\r\nhues.  The long dead were with her, fresh and blooming as in those\r\nbygone days.  And death came to her as a welcome blessing, like as\r\nevening comes to the weary child.  Her work here was finished, and\r\nfaithfully done.\r\n\r\nWhat better sentence can an emperor wish to have said over his bier?\r\nIn second childhood (that blessing clouded by a name), she said her\r\n"Nunc Dimittis"--the sweetest canticle to the holy.\r\n\r\n"Mother, good-night!  Dear mother! bless me once more!  I\'m very\r\ntired, and would fain go to sleep."  She never spoke again on this\r\nside heaven.\r\n\r\nShe died the day after their return from Liverpool.  From that time,\r\nJem became aware that his mother was jealously watching for some\r\nword or sign which should betoken his wish to return to Mary.  And\r\nyet go to Liverpool he must and would, as soon as the funeral was\r\nover, if but for a simple glimpse of his darling.  For Job had never\r\nwritten; indeed, any necessity for his so doing had never entered\r\nhis head.  If Mary died, he would announce it personally; if she\r\nrecovered, he meant to bring her home with him.  Writing was to him\r\nlittle more than an auxiliary to natural history; a way of ticketing\r\nspecimens, not of expressing thoughts.\r\n\r\nThe consequence of this want of intelligence as to Mary\'s state was,\r\nthat Jem was constantly anticipating that every person and every\r\nscrap of paper was to convey to him the news of her death.  He could\r\nnot endure this state long; but he resolved not to disturb the house\r\nby announcing to his mother his purposed intention of returning to\r\nLiverpool, until the dead had been buried forth.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday afternoon they laid her low with many tears.  Will wept as\r\none who would not be comforted.\r\n\r\nThe old childish feeling came over him, the feeling of loneliness at\r\nbeing left among strangers.\r\n\r\nBy-and-by, Margaret timidly stole near him, as if waiting to\r\nconsole; and soon his passion sank down to grief, and grief gave way\r\nto melancholy, and though he felt as if he never could be joyful\r\nagain, he was all the while unconsciously approaching nearer to the\r\nfull happiness of calling Margaret his own, and a golden thread was\r\ninterwoven even now with the darkness of his sorrow.  Yet it was on\r\nhis arm that Jane Wilson leant on her return homewards.  Jem took\r\ncharge of Margaret.\r\n\r\n"Margaret, I\'m bound for Liverpool by the first train to-morrow; I\r\nmust set your grandfather at liberty."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure he likes nothing better than watching over poor Mary; he\r\nloves her nearly as well as me.  But let me go!  I have been so full\r\nof poor Alice, I\'ve never thought of it before; I can\'t do so much\r\nas many a one, but Mary will like to have a woman about her that she\r\nknows.  I\'m sorry I waited to be reminded, Jem," replied Margaret,\r\nwith some little self-reproach.\r\n\r\nBut Margaret\'s proposition did not at all agree with her companion\'s\r\nwishes.  He found he had better speak out, and put his intention at\r\nonce to the right motive; the subterfuge about setting Job Legh at\r\nliberty had done him harm instead of good.\r\n\r\n"To tell truth, Margaret, it\'s I that must go, and that for my own\r\nsake, not your grandfather\'s.  I can rest neither by night nor day\r\nfor thinking on Mary.  Whether she lives or dies, I look on her as\r\nmy wife before God, as surely and solemnly as if we were married.\r\nSo being, I have the greatest right to look after her, and I cannot\r\nyield it even to"--\r\n\r\n"Her father," said Margaret, finishing his interrupted sentence.\r\n"It seems strange that a girl like her should be thrown on the bare\r\nworld to struggle through so bad an illness.  No one seems to know\r\nwhere John Barton is, else I thought of getting Morris to write him\r\na letter telling him about Mary.  I wish he was home, that I do!"\r\n\r\nJem could not echo this wish.\r\n\r\n"Mary\'s not bad off for friends where she is," said he.  "I call\r\nthem friends, though a week ago we none of us knew there were such\r\nfolks in the world.  But being anxious and sorrowful about the same\r\nthing makes people friends quicker than anything, I think.  She\'s\r\nlike a mother to Mary in her ways; and he bears a good character, as\r\nfar as I could learn just in that hurry.  We\'re drawing near home,\r\nand I\'ve not said my say, Margaret.  I want you to look after mother\r\na bit.  She\'ll not like my going, and I\'ve got to break it to her\r\nyet.  If she takes it very badly, I\'ll come back to-morrow night;\r\nbut if she\'s not against it very much, I mean to stay till it\'s\r\nsettled about Mary, one way or the other.  Will, you know, will be\r\nthere, Margaret, to help a bit in doing for mother."\r\n\r\nWill\'s being there made the only objection Margaret saw to this\r\nplan.  She disliked the idea of seeming to throw herself in his way,\r\nand yet she did not like to say anything of this feeling to Jem, who\r\nhad all along seemed perfectly unconscious of any love-affair,\r\nbesides his own, in progress.\r\n\r\nSo Margaret gave a reluctant consent.\r\n\r\n"If you can just step up to our house to-night, Jem, I\'ll put up a\r\nfew things as may be useful to Mary, and then you can say when\r\nyou\'ll likely be back.  If you come home to-morrow night, and Will\'s\r\nthere, perhaps I need not step up?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Margaret, do!  I shan\'t leave easy unless you go some time in\r\nthe day to see mother.  I\'ll come to-night, though; and now\r\ngood-bye.  Stay! do you think you could just coax poor Will to walk\r\na bit home with you, that I might speak to mother by myself?"\r\n\r\nNo! that Margaret could not do.  That was expecting too great a\r\nsacrifice of bashful feeling.\r\n\r\nBut the object was accomplished by Will\'s going upstairs immediately\r\non their return to the house, to indulge his mournful thoughts\r\nalone.  As soon as Jem and his mother were left by themselves, he\r\nbegan on the subject uppermost in his mind.\r\n\r\n"Mother!"\r\n\r\nShe put her handkerchief from her eyes, and turned quickly round so\r\nas to face him where he stood, thinking what best to say.  The\r\nlittle action annoyed him, and he rushed at once into the subject.\r\n\r\n"Mother!  I am going back to Liverpool to-morrow morning to see how\r\nMary Barton is."\r\n\r\n"And what\'s Mary Barton to thee, that thou shouldst be running after\r\nher in that-a-way?"\r\n\r\n"If she lives, she shall be my wedded wife.  If she dies--mother, I\r\ncan\'t speak of what I shall feel if she dies."  His voice was choked\r\nin his throat.\r\n\r\nFor an instant his mother was interested by his words; and then came\r\nback the old jealousy of being supplanted in the affections of that\r\nson, who had been, as it were, newly born to her, by the escape he\r\nhad so lately experienced from danger.  So she hardened her heart\r\nagainst entertaining any feeling of sympathy; and turned away from\r\nthe face, which recalled the earnest look of his childhood, when he\r\nhad come to her in some trouble, sure of help and comfort.\r\n\r\nAnd coldly she spoke, in those tones which Jem knew and dreaded,\r\neven before the meaning they expressed was fully shaped.\r\n\r\n"Thou\'rt old enough to please thysel.  Old mothers are cast aside,\r\nand what they\'ve borne forgotten, as soon as a pretty face comes\r\nacross.  I might have thought of that last Tuesday, when I felt as\r\nif thou wert all my own, and the judge were some wild animal trying\r\nto rend thee from me.  I spoke up for thee then; but it\'s all\r\nforgotten now, I suppose."\r\n\r\n"Mother! you know all this while, YOU KNOW I can never forget any\r\nkindness you\'ve ever done for me; and they\'ve been many.  Why should\r\nyou think I\'ve only room for one love in my heart?  I can love you\r\nas dearly as ever, and Mary too, as much as man ever loved woman."\r\n\r\nHe awaited a reply.  None was vouchsafed.\r\n\r\n"Mother, answer me!" said he, at last.\r\n\r\n"What mun I answer?  You asked me no question."\r\n\r\n"Well! I ask you this now.  To-morrow morning I go to Liverpool to\r\nsee her who is as my wife.  Dear mother! will you bless me on my\r\nerrand?  If it please God she recovers, will you take her to you as\r\nyou would a daughter?"\r\n\r\nShe could neither refuse nor assent.\r\n\r\n"Why need you go?" said she querulously, at length.  "You\'ll be\r\ngetting in some mischief or another again.  Can\'t you stop at home\r\nquiet with me?"\r\n\r\nJem got up, and walked about the room in despairing impatience.  She\r\nwould not understand his feelings.  At last he stopped right before\r\nthe place where she was sitting, with an air of injured meekness on\r\nher face.\r\n\r\n"Mother!  I often think what a good man father was!  I\'ve often\r\nheard you tell of your courting days; and of the accident that\r\nbefell you, and how ill you were.  How long is it ago?"\r\n\r\n"Near upon five-and-twenty years," said she, with a sigh.\r\n\r\n"You little thought when you were so ill you should live to have\r\nsuch a fine strapping son as I am, did you now?"\r\n\r\nShe smiled a little and looked up at him, which was just what he\r\nwanted.\r\n\r\n"Thou\'rt not so fine a man as thy father was, by a deal," said she,\r\nlooking at him with much fondness, notwithstanding her depreciatory\r\nwords.\r\n\r\nHe took another turn or two up and down the room.  He wanted to bend\r\nthe subject round to his own case.\r\n\r\n"Those were happy days when father was alive!"\r\n\r\n"You may say so, lad!  Such days as will never come again to me, at\r\nany rate."  She sighed sorrowfully.\r\n\r\n"Mother!" said he at last, stopping short, and taking her hand in\r\nhis with tender affection, "you\'d like me to be as happy a man as my\r\nfather was before me, would not you?  You\'d like me to have some one\r\nto make me as happy as you made father?  Now, would you not, dear\r\nmother?"\r\n\r\n"I did not make him as happy as I might ha\' done," murmured she, in\r\na low, sad voice of self-reproach.  "Th\' accident gave a jar to my\r\ntemper it\'s never got the better of; and now he\'s gone where he can\r\nnever know how I grieve for having frabbed him as I did."\r\n\r\n"Nay, mother, we don\'t know that!" said Jem, with gentle soothing.\r\n"Anyhow, you and father got along with as few rubs as most people.\r\nBut for HIS sake, dear mother, don\'t say me nay, now that I come to\r\nyou to ask your blessing before setting out to see her, who is to be\r\nmy wife, if ever woman is; for HIS sake, if not for mine, love her\r\nwhom I shall bring home to be to me all you were to him: and, mother!\r\nI do not ask for a truer or a tenderer heart than yours is, in the\r\nlong run."\r\n\r\nThe hard look left her face; though her eyes were still averted from\r\nJem\'s gaze, it was more because they were brimming over with tears,\r\ncalled forth by his words, than because any angry feeling yet\r\nremained.  And when his manly voice died away in low pleadings, she\r\nlifted up her hands, and bent down her son\'s head below the level of\r\nher own; and then she solemnly uttered a blessing.\r\n\r\n"God bless thee, Jem, my own dear lad.  And may He bless Mary Barton\r\nfor thy sake."\r\n\r\nJem\'s heart leapt up, and from this time hope took the place of fear\r\nin his anticipations with regard to Mary.\r\n\r\n"Mother! you show your own true self to Mary, and she\'ll love you as\r\ndearly as I do."\r\n\r\nSo with some few smiles, and some few tears, and much earnest\r\ntalking, the evening wore away.\r\n\r\n"I must be off to see Margaret.  Why, it\'s near ten o\'clock!  Could\r\nyou have thought it?  Now don\'t you stop up for me, mother.  You and\r\nWill go to bed, for you\'ve both need of it.  I shall be home in an\r\nhour."\r\n\r\nMargaret had felt the evening long and lonely; and was all but\r\ngiving up the thoughts of Jem\'s coming that night, when she heard\r\nhis step at the door.\r\n\r\nHe told her of his progress with his mother; he told her his hopes\r\nand was silent on the subject of his fears.\r\n\r\n"To think how sorrow and joy are mixed up together.  You\'ll date\r\nyour start in life as Mary\'s acknowledged lover from poor Alice\r\nWilson\'s burial day.  Well! the dead are soon forgotten!"\r\n\r\n"Dear Margaret!  But you\'re worn-out with your long evening waiting\r\nfor me.  I don\'t wonder.  But never you, nor any one else, think\r\nbecause God sees fit to call up new interests, perhaps right out of\r\nthe grave, that therefore the dead are forgotten.  Margaret, you\r\nyourself can remember our looks, and fancy what we\'re like."\r\n\r\n"Yes! but what has that to do with remembering Alice?"\r\n\r\n"Why, just this.  You\'re not always trying to think on our faces,\r\nand making a labour of remembering; but often, I\'ll be bound, when\r\nyou\'re sinking off to sleep, or when you\'re very quiet and still,\r\nthe faces you knew so well when you could see, come smiling before\r\nyou with loving looks.  Or you remember them, without striving after\r\nit, and without thinking it\'s your duty to keep recalling them.  And\r\nso it is with them that are hidden from our sight.  If they\'ve been\r\nworthy to be heartily loved while alive, they\'ll not be forgotten\r\nwhen dead; it\'s against nature.  And we need no more be upbraiding\r\nourselves for letting in God\'s rays of light upon our sorrow, and no\r\nmore be fearful of forgetting them, because their memory is not\r\nalways haunting and taking up our minds, than you need to trouble\r\nyourself about remembering your grandfather\'s face, or what the\r\nstars were like--you can\'t forget if you would, what it\'s such a\r\npleasure to think about.  Don\'t fear my forgetting Aunt Alice."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not, Jem; not now, at least; only you seemed so full about\r\nMary."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve kept it down so long, remember.  How glad Aunt Alice would\r\nhave been to know that I might hope to have her for my wife! that\'s\r\nto say, if God spares her!"\r\n\r\n"She would not have known it, even if you could have told her this\r\nlast fortnight--ever since you went away she\'s been thinking always\r\nthat she was a little child at her mother\'s apron-string.  She must\r\nhave been a happy little thing; it was such a pleasure to her to\r\nthink about those early days, when she lay old and grey on her\r\ndeathbed."\r\n\r\n"I never knew any one seem more happy all her life long."\r\n\r\n"Ay! and how gentle and easy her death was!  She thought her mother\r\nwas near her."\r\n\r\nThey fell into calm thought above those last peaceful, happy hours.\r\n\r\nIt struck eleven.\r\n\r\nJem started up.\r\n\r\n"I should have been gone long ago.  Give me the bundle.  You\'ll not\r\nforget my mother.  Good-night, Margaret."\r\n\r\nShe let him out and bolted the door behind him.  He stood on the\r\nsteps to adjust some fastening about the bundle.  The court, the\r\nstreet, was deeply still.  Long ago all had retired to rest on that\r\nquiet Sabbath evening.  The stars shone down on the silent deserted\r\nstreets, and the clear soft moonlight fell in bright masses, leaving\r\nthe steps on which Jem stood in shadow.\r\n\r\nA footfall was heard along the pavement; slow and heavy was the\r\nsound.  Before Jem had ended his little piece of business, a form\r\nhad glided into sight; a wan, feeble figure, bearing with evident\r\nand painful labour a jug of water from a neighbouring pump.  It went\r\nbefore Jem, turned up the court at the corner of which he was\r\nstanding, passed into the broad, calm light; and there, with bowed\r\nhead, sinking and shrunk body, Jem recognised John Barton.\r\n\r\nNo haunting ghost could have had less of the energy of life in its\r\ninvoluntary motions than he, who, nevertheless, went on with the\r\nsame measured clockwork tread until the door of his own house was\r\nreached.  And then he disappeared, and the latch fell feebly to, and\r\nmade a faint and wavering sound, breaking the solemn silence of the\r\nnight.  Then all again was still.\r\n\r\nFor a minute or two Jem stood motionless, stunned by the thoughts\r\nwhich the sight of Mary\'s father had called up.\r\n\r\nMargaret did not know he was at home: had he stolen like a thief\r\nby dead of night into his own dwelling?  Depressed as Jem had often\r\nand long seen him, this night there was something different about\r\nhim still; beaten down by some inward storm, he seemed to grovel\r\nalong, all self-respect lost and gone.\r\n\r\nMust he be told of Mary\'s state?  Jem felt he must not; and this for\r\nmany reasons.  He could not be informed of her illness without many\r\nother particulars being communicated at the same time, of which it\r\nwere better he should be kept in ignorance; indeed, of which Mary\r\nherself could alone give the full explanation.  No suspicion that he\r\nwas the criminal seemed hitherto to have been excited in the mind of\r\nany one.  Added to these reasons was Jem\'s extreme unwillingness to\r\nface him, with the belief in his breast that he, and none other, had\r\ndone the fearful deed.\r\n\r\nIt was true that he was Mary\'s father, and as such had every right\r\nto be told of all concerning her; but supposing he were, and that he\r\nfollowed the impulse so natural to a father, and wished to go to\r\nher, what might be the consequences?  Among the mingled feelings she\r\nhad revealed in her delirium, ay, mingled even with the most tender\r\nexpressions of love for her father, was a sort of horror of him; a\r\ndread of him as a blood-shedder, which seemed to separate him into\r\ntwo persons,--one, the father who had dandled her on his knee, and\r\nloved her all her life long; the other, the assassin, the cause of\r\nall her trouble and woe.\r\n\r\nIf he presented himself before her while this idea of his character\r\nwas uppermost, who might tell the consequence?\r\n\r\nJem could not, and would not, expose her to any such fearful chance:\r\nand to tell the truth, I believe he looked upon her as more his own,\r\nto guard from all shadow of injury with most loving care, than as\r\nbelonging to any one else in this world, though girt with the\r\nreverend name of Father, and guiltless of aught that might have\r\nlessened such reverence.\r\n\r\nIf you think this account of mine confused, of the half-feelings,\r\nhalf-reasons, which passed through Jem\'s mind, as he stood gazing on\r\nthe empty space, where that crushed form had so lately been\r\nseen,--if you are perplexed to disentangle the real motives, I do\r\nassure you it was from just such an involved set of thoughts that\r\nJem drew the resolution to act as if he had not seen that phantom\r\nlikeness of John Barton; himself, yet not himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIV.   THE RETURN HOME.\r\n\r\n  "DIXWELL.  Forgiveness!  Oh, forgiveness, and a grave!\r\n   MARY.     God knows thy heart, my father! and I shudder\r\n             To think what thou perchance hast acted.\r\n   DIXWELL.  Oh!\r\n   MARY.     No common load of woe is thine, my father."\r\n                                       --ELLIOT\'S Kerhonah.\r\n\r\nMary still hovered between life and death when Jem arrived at the\r\nhouse where she lay; and the doctors were as yet unwilling to\r\ncompromise their wisdom by allowing too much hope to be entertained.\r\nBut the state of things, if not less anxious, was less distressing\r\nthan when Jem had quitted her.  She lay now in a stupor, which was\r\npartly disease, and partly exhaustion after the previous excitement.\r\n\r\nAnd now Jem found the difficulty which every one who has watched by\r\na sick-bed knows full well; and which is perhaps more insurmountable\r\nto men than it is to women,--the difficulty of being patient, and\r\ntrying not to expect any visible change for long, long hours of sad\r\nmonotony.\r\n\r\nBut after a while the reward came.  The laboured breathing became\r\nlower and softer, the heavy look of oppressive pain melted away from\r\nthe face, and a languor that was almost peace took the place of\r\nsuffering.  She slept a natural sleep; and they stole about on\r\ntiptoe, and spoke low, and softly, and hardly dared to breathe,\r\nhowever much they longed to sigh out their thankful relief.\r\n\r\nShe opened her eyes.  Her mind was in the tender state of a lately\r\nborn infant\'s.  She was pleased with the gay but not dazzling\r\ncolours of the paper; soothed by the subdued light; and quite\r\nsufficiently amused by looking at all the objects in the room--the\r\ndrawing of the ships, the festoons of the curtain, the bright\r\nflowers on the painted backs of the chairs--to care for any stronger\r\nexcitement.  She wondered at the ball of glass, containing various\r\ncoloured sands from the Isle of Wight, or some other place, which\r\nhung suspended from the middle of the little valance over the\r\nwindow.  But she did not care to exert herself to ask any questions,\r\nalthough she saw Mrs. Sturgis standing at the bedside with some tea,\r\nready to drop it into her mouth by spoonfuls.\r\n\r\nShe did not see the face of honest joy, of earnest\r\nthankfulness,--the clasped hands, the beaming eyes,--the trembling\r\neagerness of gesture, of one who had long awaited her awakening, and\r\nwho now stood behind the curtains watching through some little chink\r\nher every faint motion; or if she had caught a glimpse of that\r\nloving, peeping face, she was in too exhausted a state to have taken\r\nmuch notice, or have long retained the impression that he she loved\r\nso well was hanging about her, and blessing God for every conscious\r\nlook which stole over her countenance.\r\n\r\nShe fell softly into slumber, without a word having been spoken by\r\nany one during that half-hour of inexpressible joy.  And again the\r\nstillness was enforced by a sign and whispered word, but with eyes\r\nthat beamed out their bright thoughts of hope.  Jem sat by the side\r\nof the bed, holding back the little curtain, and gazing as if he\r\ncould never gaze his fill at the pale, wasted face, so marbled and\r\nso chiselled in its wan outline.\r\n\r\nShe wakened once more; her soft eyes opened, and met his overbending\r\nlook.  She smiled gently, as a baby does when it sees its mother\r\ntending its little cot; and continued her innocent, infantine gaze\r\ninto his face, as if the sight gave her much unconscious pleasure.\r\nBut by-and-by a different expression came into her sweet eyes; a\r\nlook of memory and intelligence; her white flesh flushed the\r\nbrightest rosy red, and with feeble motion she tried to hide her\r\nhead in the pillow.\r\n\r\nIt required all Jem\'s self-control to do what he knew and felt to be\r\nnecessary, to call Mrs. Sturgis, who was quietly dozing by the\r\nfireside; and that done, he felt almost obliged to leave the room to\r\nkeep down the happy agitation which would gush out in every feature,\r\nevery gesture, and every tone.\r\n\r\nFrom that time forward Mary\'s progress towards health was rapid.\r\n\r\nThere was every reason, but one, in favour of her speedy removal\r\nhome.  All Jem\'s duties lay in Manchester.  It was his mother\'s\r\ndwelling-place, and there his plans for life had been to be worked\r\nout; plans which the suspicion and imprisonment he had fallen into,\r\nhad thrown for a time into a chaos, which his presence was required\r\nto arrange into form.  For he might find, in spite of a jury\'s\r\nverdict, that too strong a taint was on his character for him ever\r\nto labour in Manchester again.  He remembered the manner in which\r\nsome one suspected of having been a convict was shunned by masters\r\nand men, when he had accidentally met with work in their foundry;\r\nthe recollection smote him now, how he himself had thought it did\r\nnot become an honest upright man to associate with one who had been\r\na prisoner.  He could not choose but think on that poor humble\r\nbeing, with his downcast conscious look; hunted out of the workshop,\r\nwhere he had sought to earn an honest livelihood, by the looks, and\r\nhalf-spoken words, and the black silence of repugnance (worse than\r\nwords to bear), that met him on all sides.\r\n\r\nJem felt that his own character had been attainted; and that to many\r\nit might still appear suspicious.  He knew that he could convince\r\nthe world, by a future as blameless as his past had been, that he\r\nwas innocent.  But at the same time he saw that he must have\r\npatience, and nerve himself for some trials; and the sooner these\r\nwere undergone, the sooner he was aware of the place he held in\r\nmen\'s estimation, the better.  He longed to have presented himself\r\nonce more at the foundry; and then the reality would drive away the\r\npictures that would (unbidden) come of a shunned man, eyed askance\r\nby all, and driven forth to shape out some new career.\r\n\r\nI said every reason "but one" inclined Jem to hasten Mary\'s return\r\nas soon as she was sufficiently convalescent.  That one was the\r\nmeeting which awaited her at home.\r\n\r\nTurn it over as Jem would, he could not decide what was the best\r\ncourse to pursue.  He could compel himself to any line of conduct\r\nthat his reason and his sense of right told him to be desirable; but\r\nthey did not tell him it was desirable to speak to Mary, in her\r\ntender state of mind and body, of her father.  How much would be\r\nimplied by the mere mention of his name!  Speak it as calmly, and as\r\nindifferently as he might, he could not avoid expressing some\r\nconsciousness of the terrible knowledge she possessed.\r\n\r\nShe, for her part, was softer and gentler than she had even been in\r\nher gentlest mood; since her illness, her motions, her glances, her\r\nvoice were all tender in their languor.  It seemed almost a trouble\r\nto her to break the silence with the low sounds of her own sweet\r\nvoice, and her words fell sparingly on Jem\'s greedy, listening ear.\r\n\r\nHer face was, however, so full of love and confidence, that Jem felt\r\nno uneasiness at the state of silent abstraction into which she\r\noften fell.  If she did but love him, all would yet go right; and it\r\nwas better not to press for confidence on that one subject which\r\nmust be painful to both.\r\n\r\nThere came a fine, bright, balmy day.  And Mary tottered once more\r\nout into the open air, leaning on Jem\'s arm, and close to his\r\nbeating heart.  And Mrs. Sturgis watched them from her door, with a\r\nblessing on her lips, as they went slowly up the street.\r\n\r\nThey came in sight of the river.  Mary shuddered.\r\n\r\n"O Jem! take me home.  Yon river seems all made of glittering,\r\nheaving, dazzling metal, just as it did when I began to be ill."\r\n\r\nJem led her homewards.  She dropped her head as searching for\r\nsomething on the ground.\r\n\r\n"Jem!"  He was all attention.  She paused for an instant.  "When may\r\nI go home?  To Manchester, I mean.  I am so weary of this place; and\r\nI would fain be at home."\r\n\r\nShe spoke in a feeble voice; not at all impatiently, as the words\r\nthemselves would seem to intimate, but in a mournful way, as if\r\nanticipating sorrow even in the very fulfilment of her wishes.\r\n\r\n"Darling! we will go whenever you wish; whenever you feel strong\r\nenough.  I asked Job to tell Margaret to get all in readiness for\r\nyou to go there at first.  She\'ll tend you and nurse you.  You must\r\nnot go home.  Job proffered for you to go there."\r\n\r\n"Ah! but I must go home, Jem.  I\'ll try and not fail now in what\'s\r\nright.  There are things we must not speak on" (lowering her voice),\r\n"but you\'ll be really kind if you\'ll not speak against my going\r\nhome.  Let us say no more about it, dear Jem.  I must go home, and I\r\nmust go alone."\r\n\r\n"Not alone, Mary!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, alone!  I cannot tell you why I ask it.  And if you guess, I\r\nknow you well enough to be sure you\'ll understand why I ask you\r\nnever to speak on that again to me, till I begin.  Promise, dear\r\nJem, promise!"\r\n\r\nHe promised; to gratify that beseeching face, he promised.  And then\r\nhe repented, and felt as if he had done ill.  Then again he felt as\r\nif she were the best judge, and knowing all (perhaps more than even\r\nhe did), might be forming plans which his interference would mar.\r\n\r\nOne thing was certain! it was a miserable thing to have this awful\r\nforbidden ground of discourse; to guess at each other\'s thoughts,\r\nwhen eyes were averted, and cheeks blanched, and words stood still,\r\narrested in their flow by some casual allusion.\r\n\r\nAt last a day, fine enough for Mary to travel on, arrived.  She had\r\nwished to go, but now her courage failed her.  How could she have\r\nsaid she was weary of that quiet house, where even Ben Sturgis\'s\r\ngrumblings only made a kind of harmonious bass in the concord\r\nbetween him and his wife, so thoroughly did they know each other\r\nwith the knowledge of many years!  How could she have longed to quit\r\nthat little peaceful room where she had experienced such loving\r\ntendence!  Even the very check bed-curtains became dear to her under\r\nthe idea of seeing them no more.  If it was so with inanimate\r\nobjects, if they had such power of exciting regret, what were her\r\nfeelings with regard to the kind old couple, who had taken the\r\nstranger in, and cared for her, and nursed her, as though she had\r\nbeen a daughter?  Each wilful sentence spoken in the half-\r\nunconscious irritation of feebleness came now with avenging\r\nself-reproach to her memory, as she hung about Mrs. Sturgis, with\r\nmany tears, which served instead of words to express her gratitude\r\nand love.\r\n\r\nBen bustled about with the square bottle of Goldenwasser in one of\r\nhis hands, and a small tumbler in the other; he went to Mary, Jem,\r\nand his wife in succession, pouring out a glass for each, and\r\nbidding them drink it to keep their spirits up; but as each\r\nseverally refused, he drank it himself; and passed on to offer the\r\nsame hospitality to another, with the like refusal, and the like\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nWhen he had swallowed the last of the three draughts, he\r\ncondescended to give his reasons for having done so.\r\n\r\n"I cannot abide waste.  What\'s poured out mun be drunk.  That\'s my\r\nmaxim."  So saying, he replaced the bottle in the cupboard.\r\n\r\nIt was he who, in a firm commanding voice, at last told Jem and Mary\r\nto be off, or they would be too late.  Mrs. Sturgis had kept up till\r\nthen; but as they left her house, she could no longer restrain her\r\ntears, and cried aloud in spite of her husband\'s upbraiding.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps they\'ll be too late for the train!" exclaimed she, with a\r\ndegree of hope, as the clock struck two.\r\n\r\n"What! and come back again!  No! no! that would never do.  We\'ve\r\ndone our part, and cried our cry; it\'s no use going over the same\r\nground again.  I should ha\' to give \'em more out of yon bottle when\r\nnext parting time came, and them three glasses they ha\' made a hole\r\nin the stuff, I can tell you.  Time Jack was back from Hamburg with\r\nsome more."\r\n\r\nWhen they reached Manchester, Mary looked very white, and the\r\nexpression of her face was almost stern.  She was in fact summoning\r\nup her resolution to meet her father if he were at home.  Jem had\r\nnever named his midnight glimpse of John Barton to human being:\r\nbut Mary had a sort of presentiment, that wander where he would, he\r\nwould seek his home at last.  But in what mood she dreaded to think.\r\nFor the knowledge of her father\'s capability of guilt seemed to have\r\nopened a dark gulf in his character, into the depths of which she\r\ntrembled to look.  At one moment she would fain have claimed\r\nprotection against the life she must lead, for some time at least,\r\nalone with a murderer!  She thought of his gloom, before his mind\r\nwas haunted by the memory of so terrible a crime; his moody,\r\nirritable ways.  She imagined the evenings as of old; she, toiling\r\nat some work, long after houses were shut, and folks abed; he, more\r\nsavage than he had ever been before with the inward gnawing of his\r\nremorse.  At such times she could have cried aloud with terror, at\r\nthe scenes her fancy conjured up.\r\n\r\nBut her filial duty, nay, her love and gratitude for many deeds of\r\nkindness done to her as a little child, conquered all fear.  She\r\nwould endure all imaginable terrors, although of daily occurrence.\r\nAnd she would patiently bear all wayward violence of temper; more\r\nthan patiently would she bear it--pitifully, as one who knew of some\r\nawful curse awaiting the blood-shedder.  She would watch over him\r\ntenderly, as the innocent should watch over the guilty; awaiting the\r\ngracious seasons, wherein to pour oil and balm into the bitter\r\nwounds.\r\n\r\nWith the untroubled peace which the resolve to endure to the end\r\ngives, she approached the house that from habit she still called\r\nhome, but which possessed the holiness of home no longer.  "Jem!"\r\nsaid she, as they stood at the entrance to the court, close by Job\r\nLegh\'s door, "you must go in there and wait half-an-hour.  Not less.\r\nIf in that time I don\'t come back, you go your ways to your mother.\r\nGive her my dear love.  I will send by Margaret when I want to see\r\nyou."\r\n\r\nShe sighed heavily.\r\n\r\n"Mary! Mary!  I cannot leave you.  You speak as coldly as if we were\r\nto be nought to each other.  And my heart\'s bound up in you.  I know\r\nwhy you bid me keep away, but"--\r\n\r\nShe put her hand on his arm, as he spoke in a loud agitated tone;\r\nshe looked into his face with upbraiding love in her eyes, and then\r\nshe said, while her lips quivered, and he felt her whole frame\r\ntrembling--\r\n\r\n"Dear Jem!  I often could have told you more of love, if I had not\r\nonce spoken out so free.  Remember that time, Jem, if ever you think\r\nme cold.  Then, the love that\'s in my heart would out in words; but\r\nnow, though I\'m silent on the pain I\'m feeling in quitting you, the\r\nlove is in my heart all the same.  But this is not the time to speak\r\non such things.  If I do not do what I feel to be right now, I may\r\nblame myself all my life long!  Jem, you promised"--\r\n\r\nAnd so saying she left him.  She went quicker than she would\r\notherwise have passed over those few yards of ground, for fear he\r\nshould still try to accompany her.  Her hand was on the latch, and\r\nin a breath the door was opened.\r\n\r\nThere sat her father, still and motionless--not even turning his\r\nhead to see who had entered; but perhaps he recognised the footstep--\r\nthe trick of action.\r\n\r\nHe sat by the fire; the grate, I should say, for fire there was\r\nnone.  Some dull grey ashes, negligently left, long days ago, coldly\r\nchoked up the bars.  He had taken the accustomed seat from mere\r\nforce of habit, which ruled his automaton body.  For all energy,\r\nboth physical and mental, seemed to have retreated inwards to some\r\nof the great citadels of life, there to do battle against the\r\nDestroyer, Conscience.\r\n\r\nHis hands were crossed, his fingers interlaced; usually a position\r\nimplying some degree of resolution, or strength; but in him it was\r\nso faintly maintained, that it appeared more the result of chance;\r\nan attitude requiring some application of outward force to alter--\r\nand a blow with a straw seemed as though it would be sufficient.\r\n\r\nAnd as for his face, it was sunk and worn--like a skull, with yet a\r\nsuffering expression that skulls have not!  Your heart would have\r\nached to have seen the man, however hardly you might have judged his\r\ncrime.\r\n\r\nBut crime and all was forgotten by his daughter, as she saw his\r\nabashed look, his smitten helplessness.  All along she had felt it\r\ndifficult (as I may have said before) to reconcile the two ideas, of\r\nher father and a blood-shedder.  But now it was impossible.  He was\r\nher father! her own dear father! and in his sufferings, whatever\r\ntheir cause, more dearly loved than ever before.  His crime was a\r\nthing apart, never more to be considered by her.\r\n\r\nAnd tenderly did she treat him, and fondly did she serve him in\r\nevery way that heart could devise, or hand execute.\r\n\r\nShe had some money about her, the price of her strange services as a\r\nwitness; and when the lingering dusk grew on she stole out to effect\r\nsome purchases necessary for her father\'s comfort.\r\n\r\nFor how body and soul had been kept together, even as much as they\r\nwere, during the days he had dwelt alone, no one can say.  The house\r\nwas bare as when Mary had left it, of coal, or of candle, of food,\r\nor of blessing in any shape.\r\n\r\nShe came quickly home; but as she passed Job Legh\'s door, she\r\nstopped.  Doubtless Jem had long since gone; and doubtless, too, he\r\nhad given Margaret some good reason for not intruding upon her\r\nfriend for this night at least, otherwise Mary would have seen her\r\nbefore now.\r\n\r\nBut to-morrow,--would she not come in to-morrow?  And who so quick\r\nas blind Margaret in noticing tones, and sighs, and even silence?\r\n\r\nShe did not give herself time for further thought, her desire to be\r\nonce more with her father was too pressing; but she opened the door,\r\nbefore she well knew what to say.\r\n\r\n"It\'s Mary Barton!  I know her by her breathing!  Grandfather, it\'s\r\nMary Barton!"\r\n\r\nMargaret\'s joy at meeting her, the open demonstration of her love,\r\naffected Mary much; she could not keep from crying, and sat down\r\nweak and agitated on the first chair she could find.\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay, Mary! thou\'rt looking a bit different to when I saw thee\r\nlast.  Thou\'lt give Jem and me good characters for sick nurses, I\r\ntrust.  If all trades fail, I\'ll turn to that.  Jem\'s place is for\r\nlife, I reckon.  Nay, never redden so, lass.  You and he know each\r\nother\'s minds by this time!"\r\n\r\nMargaret held her hand, and gently smiled into her face.\r\n\r\nJob Legh took the candle up, and began a leisurely inspection.\r\n\r\n"Thou hast gotten a bit of pink in thy cheeks,--not much; but when\r\nlast I see thee, thy lips were as white as a sheet.  Thy nose is\r\nsharpish at th\' end; thou\'rt more like thy father than ever thou\r\nwert before.  Lord! child, what\'s the matter?  Art thou going to\r\nfaint?"\r\n\r\nFor Mary had sickened at the mention of that name; yet she felt that\r\nnow or never was the time to speak.\r\n\r\n"Father\'s come home!" she said, "but he\'s very poorly; I never saw\r\nhim as he is now before.  I asked Jem not to come near him for fear\r\nit might fidget him."\r\n\r\nShe spoke hastily, and (to her own idea) in an unnatural manner.\r\nBut they did not seem to notice it, nor to take the hint she had\r\nthrown out of company being unacceptable; for Job Legh directly put\r\ndown some insect, which he was impaling on a corking-pin, and\r\nexclaimed--\r\n\r\n"Thy father come home!  Why, Jem never said a word of it!  And\r\nailing too!  I\'ll go in, and cheer him with a bit of talk.  I never\r\nknew any good come of delegating it."\r\n\r\n"O Job! father cannot stand--father is too ill.  Don\'t come; not but\r\nthat you\'re very kind and good; but to-night--indeed," said she at\r\nlast, in despair, seeing Job still persevere in putting away his\r\nthings; "you must not come till I send or come for you.  Father\'s in\r\nthat strange way, I can\'t answer for it if he sees strangers.\r\nPlease don\'t come.  I\'ll come and tell you every day how he goes on.\r\nI must be off now to see after him.  Dear Job! kind Job! don\'t be\r\nangry with me.  If you knew all, you\'d pity me."\r\n\r\nFor Job was muttering away in high dudgeon, and even Margaret\'s tone\r\nwas altered as she wished Mary good-night.  Just then she could ill\r\nbrook coldness from any one, and least of all bear the idea of being\r\nconsidered ungrateful by so kind and zealous a friend as Job had\r\nbeen; so she turned round suddenly, even when her hand was on the\r\nlatch of the door, and ran back, and threw her arms about his neck,\r\nand kissed him first, and then Margaret.  And then, the tears fast\r\nfalling down her cheeks, but no word spoken, she hastily left the\r\nhouse, and went back to her home.\r\n\r\nThere was no change in her father\'s position, or in his spectral\r\nlook.  He had answered her questions (but few in number, for so many\r\nsubjects were unapproachable) by monosyllables, and in a weak, high,\r\nchildish voice; but he had not lifted his eyes; he could not meet\r\nhis daughter\'s look.  And she, when she spoke, or as she moved\r\nabout, avoided letting her eyes rest upon him.  She wished to be her\r\nusual self; but while everything was done with a consciousness of\r\npurpose, she felt it was impossible.\r\n\r\nIn this manner things went on for some days.  At night he feebly\r\nclambered upstairs to bed; and during those long dark hours Mary\r\nheard those groans of agony which never escaped his lips by day,\r\nwhen they were compressed in silence over his inward woe.\r\n\r\nMany a time she sat up listening, and wondering if it would ease his\r\nmiserable heart if she went to him, and told him she knew all, and\r\nloved and pitied him more than words could tell.\r\n\r\nBy day the monotonous hours wore on in the same heavy, hushed manner\r\nas on that first dreary afternoon.  He ate,--but without that\r\nrelish; and food seemed no longer to nourish him, for each morning\r\nhis face had caught more of the ghastly foreshadowing of Death.\r\n\r\nThe neighbours kept strangely aloof.  Of late years John Barton had\r\nhad a repellent power about him, felt by all, except to the few who\r\nhad either known him in his better and happier days, or those to\r\nwhom he had given his sympathy and his confidence.  People did not\r\ncare to enter the doors of one whose very depth of thoughtfulness\r\nrendered him moody and stern.  And now they contented themselves\r\nwith a kind inquiry when they saw Mary in her goings-out or in her\r\ncomings-in.  With her oppressing knowledge, she imagined their\r\nreserved conduct stranger than it was in reality.  She missed Job\r\nand Margaret too; who, in all former times of sorrow or anxiety\r\nsince their acquaintance first began, had been ready with their\r\nsympathy.\r\n\r\nBut most of all she missed the delicious luxury she had lately\r\nenjoyed in having Jem\'s tender love at hand every hour of the day,\r\nto ward off every wind of heaven, and every disturbing thought.\r\n\r\nShe knew he was often hovering about the house; though the knowledge\r\nseemed to come more by intuition, than by any positive sight or\r\nsound for the first day or two.  On the third day she met him at Job\r\nLegh\'s.\r\n\r\nThey received her with every effort of cordiality; but still there\r\nwas a cobweb-veil of separation between them, to which Mary was\r\nmorbidly acute; while in Jem\'s voice, and eyes, and manner, there\r\nwas every evidence of most passionate, most admiring, and most\r\ntrusting love.  The trust was shown by his respectful silence on\r\nthat one point of reserve on which she had interdicted conversation.\r\n\r\nHe left Job Legh\'s house when she did.  They lingered on the step,\r\nhe holding her hand between both of his, as loth to let her go; he\r\nquestioned her as to when he should see her again.\r\n\r\n"Mother does so want to see you," whispered he.  "Can you come to\r\nsee her to-morrow; or when?"\r\n\r\n"I cannot tell," replied she softly.  "Not yet.  Wait awhile;\r\nperhaps only a little while.  Dear Jem, I must go to him,--dearest\r\nJem."\r\n\r\nThe next day, the fourth from Mary\'s return home, as she was sitting\r\nnear the window, sadly dreaming over some work, she caught a glimpse\r\nof the last person she wished to see--of Sally Leadbitter!\r\n\r\nShe was evidently coming to their house; another moment, and she\r\ntapped at the door.  John Barton gave an anxious, uneasy\r\nside-glance.  Mary knew that if she delayed answering the knock,\r\nSally would not scruple to enter; so as hastily as if the visit had\r\nbeen desired, she opened the door, and stood there with the latch in\r\nher hand, barring up all entrance, and as much as possible\r\nobstructing all curious glances into the interior.\r\n\r\n"Well, Mary Barton!  You\'re home at last!  I heard you\'d getten\r\nhome; so I thought I\'d just step over and hear the news."\r\n\r\nShe was bent on coming in, and saw Mary\'s preventive design.  So she\r\nstood on tiptoe, looking over Mary\'s shoulders into the room where\r\nshe suspected a lover to be lurking; but instead, she saw only the\r\nfigure of the stern, gloomy father she had always been in the habit\r\nof avoiding; and she dropped down again, content to carry on the\r\nconversation where Mary chose, and as Mary chose, in whispers.\r\n\r\n"So the old governor is back again, eh?  And what does he say to all\r\nyour fine doings at Liverpool, and before?--you and I know where.\r\nYou can\'t hide it now, Mary, for it\'s all in print."\r\n\r\nMary gave a low moan--and then implored Sally to change the subject;\r\nfor unpleasant as it always was, it was doubly unpleasant in the\r\nmanner in which she was treating it.  If they had been alone Mary\r\nwould have borne it patiently--or she thought, but now she felt\r\nalmost certain, her father was listening; there was a subdued\r\nbreathing, a slight bracing-up of the listless attitude.  But there\r\nwas no arresting Sally\'s curiosity to hear all she could respecting\r\nthe adventures Mary had experienced.  She, in common with the rest\r\nof Miss Simmonds\' young ladies, was almost jealous of the fame that\r\nMary had obtained; to herself, such miserable notoriety.\r\n\r\n"Nay! there\'s no use shunning talking it over.  Why! it was in the\r\nGuardian--and the Courier--and some one told Jane Hodgson it was\r\neven copied into a London paper.  You\'ve set up heroine on your own\r\naccount, Mary Barton.  How did you like standing witness?  Aren\'t\r\nthem lawyers impudent things? staring at one so.  I\'ll be bound you\r\nwished you\'d taken my offer, and borrowed my black watered scarf!\r\nNow didn\'t you, Mary?  Speak truth!"\r\n\r\n"To tell the truth, I never thought about it then, Sally.  How could\r\nI?" asked she reproachfully.\r\n\r\n"Oh--I forgot.  You were all for that stupid James Wilson.  Well! if\r\nI\'ve ever the luck to go witness on a trial, see if I don\'t pick up\r\na better beau than the prisoner.  I\'ll aim at a lawyer\'s clerk, but\r\nI\'ll not take less than a turnkey."\r\n\r\nCast down as Mary was, she could hardly keep from smiling at the\r\nidea, so wildly incongruous with the scene she had really undergone,\r\nof looking out for admirers during a trial for murder.\r\n\r\n"I\'d no thought to be looking out for beaux, I can assure you,\r\nSally.  But don\'t let us talk any more about it; I can\'t bear to\r\nthink on it.  How is Miss Simmonds? and everybody?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, very well; and by the way, she gave me a bit of a message for\r\nyou.  You may come back to work if you\'ll behave yourself, she says.\r\nI told you she\'d be glad to have you back, after all this piece of\r\nbusiness, by way of tempting people to come to her shop.  They\'d\r\ncome from Salford to have a peep at you, for six months at least."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t talk so; I cannot come, I can never face Miss Simmonds again.\r\nAnd even if I could"--she stopped, and blushed.\r\n\r\n"Ay! I know what you are thinking on.  But that will not be this\r\nsome time, as he\'s turned off from the foundry--you\'d better think\r\ntwice afore refusing Miss Simmonds\' offer."\r\n\r\n"Turned off from the foundry?  Jem?" cried Mary.\r\n\r\n"To be sure! didn\'t you know it?  Decent men were not going to work\r\nwith a--no! I suppose I mustn\'t say it, seeing you went to such\r\ntrouble to get up an alibi; not that I should think much the worse\r\nof a spirited young fellow for falling foul of a rival--they always\r\ndo at the theatre."\r\n\r\nBut Mary\'s thoughts were with Jem.  How good he had been never to\r\nname his dismissal to her.  How much he had had to endure for her\r\nsake!\r\n\r\n"Tell me all about it," she gasped out.\r\n\r\n"Why, you see, they\'ve always swords quite handy at them plays,"\r\nbegan Sally; but Mary, with an impatient shake of her head,\r\ninterrupted--\r\n\r\n"About Jem--about Jem, I want to know."\r\n\r\n"Oh! I don\'t pretend to know more than is in every one\'s mouth:\r\nhe\'s turned away from the foundry, because folk doesn\'t think you\'ve\r\ncleared him outright of the murder; though perhaps the jury were\r\nloth to hang him.  Old Mr. Carson is savage against judge and jury,\r\nand lawyers and all, as I heard."\r\n\r\n"I must go to him, I must go to him," repeated Mary, in a hurried\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n"He\'ll tell you all I\'ve said is true, and not a word of lie,"\r\nreplied Sally.  "So I\'ll not give your answer to Miss Simmonds, but\r\nleave you to think twice about it.  Good afternoon!"\r\n\r\nMary shut the door, and turned into the house.\r\n\r\nHer father sat in the same attitude; the old unchanging attitude.\r\nOnly his head was more bowed towards the ground.\r\n\r\nShe put on her bonnet to go to Ancoats; for see, and question, and\r\ncomfort, and worship Jem, she must.\r\n\r\nAs she hung about her father for an instant before leaving him, he\r\nspoke--voluntarily spoke for the first time since her return; but\r\nhis head was drooping so low she could not hear what he said, so she\r\nstooped down; and after a moment\'s pause, he repeated the words--\r\n\r\n"Tell Jem Wilson to come here at eight o\'clock to-night."\r\n\r\nCould he have overheard her conversation with Sally Leadbitter?\r\nThey had whispered low, she thought.  Pondering on this, and many\r\nother things, she reached Ancoats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXV.   "FORGIVE US OUR TRESPASSES."\r\n\r\n                             "Oh, had he lived,\r\n      Replied Rusilla, never penitence\r\n      Had equalled his! full well I knew his heart,\r\n      Vehement in all things.  He would on himself\r\n      Have wreaked such penance as had reached the height\r\n      Of fleshy suffering,--yea, which being told,\r\n      With its portentous rigour should have made\r\n      The memory of his fault o\'erpowered and lost,\r\n      In shuddering pity and astonishment,\r\n      Fade like a feeble horror."\r\n                                   --SOUTHEY\'S Roderick.\r\n\r\nAs Mary was turning into the street where the Wilsons lived, Jem\r\novertook her.  He came upon her suddenly, and she started.  "You\'re\r\ngoing to see mother?" he asked tenderly, placing her arm within his,\r\nand slackening his pace.\r\n\r\n"Yes, and you too.  O Jem, is it true? tell me."\r\n\r\nShe felt rightly that he would guess the meaning of her only\r\nhalf-expressed inquiry.  He hesitated a moment before he answered\r\nher.\r\n\r\n"Darling, it is; it\'s no use hiding it--if you mean that I\'m no\r\nlonger to work at Duncombe\'s foundry.  It\'s no time (to my mind) to\r\nhave secrets from each other, though I did not name it yesterday,\r\nthinking you might fret.  I shall soon get work again, never fear."\r\n\r\n"But why did they turn you off, when the jury had said you were\r\ninnocent?"\r\n\r\n"It was not just to say turned off, though I don\'t think I could\r\nhave well stayed on.  A good number of the men managed to let out\r\nthey should not like to work under me again; there were some few who\r\nknew me well enough to feel I could not have done it, but more were\r\ndoubtful; and one spoke to young Mr. Duncombe, hinting at what they\r\nthought."\r\n\r\n"O Jem! what a shame!" said Mary, with mournful indignation.\r\n\r\n"Nay, darling! I\'m not for blaming them.  Poor fellows like them\r\nhave nought to stand upon and be proud of but their character, and\r\nit\'s fitting they should take care of that, and keep that free from\r\nsoil and taint."\r\n\r\n"But you--what could they get but good from you?  They might have\r\nknown you by this time."\r\n\r\n"So some do; the overlooker, I\'m sure, would know I\'m innocent.\r\nIndeed, he said as much to-day; and he said he had had some talk\r\nwith old Mr. Duncombe, and they thought it might be better if I left\r\nManchester for a bit; they\'d recommend me to some other place."\r\n\r\nBut Mary could only shake her head in a mournful way, and repeat her\r\nwords--\r\n\r\n"They might have known thee better, Jem."\r\n\r\nJem pressed the little hand he held between his own work-hardened\r\nones.  After a minute or two, he asked--\r\n\r\n"Mary, art thou much bound to Manchester?  Would it grieve thee sore\r\nto quit the old smoke-jack?"\r\n\r\n"With thee?" she asked, in a quiet, glancing way.\r\n\r\n"Ay, lass!  Trust me, I\'ll never ask thee to leave Manchester while\r\nI\'m in it.  Because I have heard fine things of Canada; and our\r\noverlooker has a cousin in the foundry line there.  Thou knowest\r\nwhere Canada is, Mary?"\r\n\r\n"Not rightly--not now, at any rate;--but with thee, Jem," her voice\r\nsunk to a soft, low whisper, "anywhere"--\r\n\r\nWhat was the use of a geographical description?\r\n\r\n"But father!" said Mary, suddenly breaking that delicious silence\r\nwith the one sharp discord in her present life.\r\n\r\nShe looked up at her lover\'s grave face; and then the message her\r\nfather had sent flashed across her memory.\r\n\r\n"O Jem, did I tell you?  Father sent word he wished to speak with\r\nyou.  I was to bid you come to him at eight to-night.  What can he\r\nwant, Jem?"\r\n\r\n"I cannot tell," replied he.  "At any rate, I\'ll go.  It\'s no use\r\ntroubling ourselves to guess," he continued, after a pause for a few\r\nminutes, during which they slowly and silently paced up and down the\r\nby-street, into which he had led her when their conversation began.\r\n"Come and see mother, and then I\'ll take thee home, Mary.  Thou wert\r\nall in a tremble when first I came up to thee; thou\'rt not fit to be\r\ntrusted home by thyself," said he, with fond exaggeration of her\r\nhelplessness.\r\n\r\nYet a little more lovers\' loitering! a few more words, in themselves\r\nnothing--to you nothing--but to those two, what tender passionate\r\nlanguage can I use to express the feelings which thrilled through\r\nthat young man and maiden, as they listened to the syllables made\r\ndear and lovely through life by that hour\'s low-whispered talk.\r\n\r\nIt struck the half-hour past seven.\r\n\r\n"Come and speak to mother; she knows you\'re to be her daughter,\r\nMary, darling."\r\n\r\nSo they went in.  Jane Wilson was rather chafed at her son\'s delay\r\nin returning home, for as yet he had managed to keep her in\r\nignorance of his dismissal from the foundry; and it was her way to\r\nprepare some little pleasure, some little comfort for those she\r\nloved; and if they, unwittingly, did not appear at the proper time\r\nto enjoy her preparation, she worked herself up into a state of\r\nfretfulness which found vent in upbraidings as soon as ever the\r\nobjects of her care appeared, thereby marring the peace which should\r\never be the atmosphere of a home, however humble; and causing a\r\nfeeling almost amounting to loathing to arise at the sight of the\r\n"stalled ox," which, though an effect and proof of careful love, has\r\nbeen the cause of so much disturbance.\r\n\r\nMrs. Wilson at first sighed, and then grumbled to herself, over the\r\nincreasing toughness of the potato-cakes she had made for her son\'s\r\ntea.\r\n\r\nThe door opened, and he came in; his face brightening into proud\r\nsmiles, Mary Barton hanging on his arm, blushing and dimpling, with\r\neyelids veiling the happy light of her eyes--there was around the\r\nyoung couple a radiant atmosphere--a glory of happiness.\r\n\r\nCould his mother mar it?  Could she break into it with her\r\nMartha-like cares?  Only for one moment did she remember her sense\r\nof injury,--her wasted trouble,--and then her whole woman\'s heart\r\nheaving with motherly love and sympathy, she opened her arms, and\r\nreceived Mary into them, as shedding tears of agitated joy, she\r\nmurmured in her ear--\r\n\r\n"Bless thee, Mary, bless thee!  Only make him happy, and God bless\r\nthee for ever!"\r\n\r\nIt took some of Jem\'s self-command to separate those whom he so much\r\nloved, and who were beginning, for his sake, to love one another so\r\ndearly.  But the time for his meeting John Barton drew on: and it\r\nwas a long way to his house.\r\n\r\nAs they walked briskly thither they hardly spoke; though many\r\nthoughts were in their minds.\r\n\r\nThe sun had not long set, but the first faint shade of twilight was\r\nover all; and when they opened the door, Jem could hardly perceive\r\nthe objects within by the waning light of day, and the flickering\r\nfire-blaze.\r\n\r\nBut Mary saw all at a glance.\r\n\r\nHer eye, accustomed to what was usual in the aspect of the room, saw\r\ninstantly what was unusual,--saw and understood it all.\r\n\r\nHer father was standing behind his habitual chair; holding by the\r\nback of it as if for support.  And opposite to him there stood Mr.\r\nCarson; the dark outline of his stern figure looming large against\r\nthe light of the fire in that little room.\r\n\r\nBehind her father sat Job Legh, his head in his hands, and resting\r\nhis elbow on the little family table, listening evidently; but as\r\nevidently deeply affected by what he heard.\r\n\r\nThere seemed to be some pause in the conversation.  Mary and Jem\r\nstood at the half-open door, not daring to stir; hardly to breathe.\r\n\r\n"And have I heard you aright?" began Mr. Carson, with his deep\r\nquivering voice.  "Man! have I heard you aright?  Was it you, then,\r\nthat killed my boy? my only son?"--(he said these last few words\r\nalmost as if appealing for pity, and then he changed his tone to one\r\nmore vehement and fierce).  "Don\'t dare to think that I shall be\r\nmerciful, and spare you, because you have come forward to accuse\r\nyourself.  I tell you I will not spare you the least pang the law\r\ncan inflict,--you, who did not show pity on my boy, shall have none\r\nfrom me."\r\n\r\n"I did not ask for any," said John Barton, in a low voice.\r\n\r\n"Ask, or not ask, what care I?  You shall be hanged--hanged--man!"\r\nsaid he, advancing his face, and repeating the word with slow,\r\ngrinding emphasis, as if to infuse some of the bitterness of his\r\nsoul into it.\r\n\r\nJohn Barton gasped, but not with fear.  It was only that he felt it\r\nterrible to have inspired such hatred, as was concentrated into\r\nevery word, every gesture of Mr. Carson\'s.\r\n\r\n"As for being hanged, sir, I know it\'s all right and proper.  I dare\r\nsay it\'s bad enough; but I tell you what, sir," speaking with an\r\noutburst, "if you\'d hanged me the day after I\'d done the deed, I\r\nwould have gone down on my knees and blessed you.  Death!  Lord,\r\nwhat is it to Life?  To such a life as I\'ve been leading this\r\nfortnight past.  Life at best is no great thing; but such a life as\r\nI have dragged through since that night," he shuddered at the\r\nthought.  "Why, sir, I\'ve been on the point of killing myself this\r\nmany a time to get away from my own thoughts.  I didn\'t! and I\'ll\r\ntell you why.  I didn\'t know but that I should be more haunted than\r\never with the recollection of my sin.  Oh! God above only can tell\r\nthe agony with which I\'ve repented me of it, and part perhaps\r\nbecause I feared He would think I were impatient of the misery He\r\nsent as punishment--far, far worse misery than any hanging, sir."\r\n\r\nHe ceased from excess of emotion.\r\n\r\nThen he began again.\r\n\r\n"Sin\' that day (it may be very wicked, sir, but it\'s the truth) I\'ve\r\nkept thinking and thinking if I were but in that world where they\r\nsay God is, He would, maybe, teach me right from wrong, even if it\r\nwere with many stripes.  I\'ve been sore puzzled here.  I would go\r\nthrough hell-fire if I could but get free from sin at last, it\'s\r\nsuch an awful thing.  As for hanging, that\'s just nought at all."\r\n\r\nHis exhaustion compelled him to sit down.  Mary rushed to him.  It\r\nseemed as if till then he had been unaware of her presence.\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay, wench!" said he feebly, "is it thee?  Where\'s Jem Wilson?"\r\n\r\nJem came forward.\r\n\r\nJohn Barton spoke again, with many a break and gasping pause--\r\n\r\n"Lad! thou hast borne a deal for me.  It\'s the meanest thing I ever\r\ndid to leave thee to bear the brunt.  Thou, who wert as innocent of\r\nany knowledge of it as the babe unborn.  I\'ll not bless thee for it.\r\nBlessing from such as me would not bring thee any good.  Thou\'lt\r\nlove Mary, though she is my child."\r\n\r\nHe ceased, and there was a pause for a few seconds.\r\n\r\nThen Mr. Carson turned to go.\r\n\r\nWhen his hand was on the latch of the door, he hesitated for an\r\ninstant.\r\n\r\n"You can have no doubt for what purpose I go.  Straight to the\r\npolice-office, to send men to take care of you, wretched man, and\r\nyour accomplice.  To-morrow morning your tale shall be repeated to\r\nthose who can commit you to gaol, and before long you shall have the\r\nopportunity of trying how desirable hanging is."\r\n\r\n"O sir!" said Mary, springing forward, and catching hold of Mr.\r\nCarson\'s arm, "my father is dying.  Look at him, sir.  If you want\r\nDeath for Death you have it.  Don\'t take him away from me these last\r\nhours.  He must go alone through Death, but let me be with him as\r\nlong as I can.  O sir! if you have any mercy in you, leave him here\r\nto die."\r\n\r\nJohn himself stood up, stiff and rigid, and replied--\r\n\r\n"Mary, wench! I owe him summit.  I will go die, where, and as he\r\nwishes me.  Thou hast said true, I am standing side by side with\r\nDeath; and it matters little where I spend the bit of time left of\r\nlife.  That time I must pass wrestling with my soul for a character\r\nto take into the other world.  I\'ll go where you see fit, sir.  He\'s\r\ninnocent," faintly indicating Jem, as he fell back in his chair.\r\n\r\n"Never fear!  They cannot touch him," said Job Legh, in a low voice.\r\n\r\nBut as Mr. Carson was on the point of leaving the house with no sign\r\nof relenting about him, he was again stopped by John Barton, who had\r\nrisen once more from his chair, and stood supporting himself on Jem,\r\nwhile he spoke.\r\n\r\n"Sir, one word!  My hairs are grey with suffering, and yours with\r\nyears"--\r\n\r\n"And have I had no suffering?" asked Mr. Carson, as if appealing for\r\nsympathy, even to the murderer of his child.\r\n\r\nAnd the murderer of his child answered to the appeal, and groaned in\r\nspirit over the anguish he had caused.\r\n\r\n"Have I had no inward suffering to blanch these hairs?  Have not I\r\ntoiled and struggled even to these years with hopes in my heart that\r\nall centred in my boy?  I did not speak of them, but were they not\r\nthere?  I seemed hard and cold; and so I might be to others, but not\r\nto him!--who shall ever imagine the love I bore to him?  Even he\r\nnever dreamed how my heart leapt up at the sound of his footstep,\r\nand how precious he was to his poor old father.  And he is gone--\r\nkilled--out of the hearing of all loving words--out of my sight for\r\never.  He was my sunshine, and now it is night!  Oh, my God! comfort\r\nme, comfort me!" cried the old man aloud.\r\n\r\nThe eyes of John Barton grew dim with tears.\r\n\r\nRich and poor, masters and men, were then brothers in the deep\r\nsuffering of the heart; for was not this the very anguish he had\r\nfelt for little Tom, in years so long gone by, that they seemed like\r\nanother life!\r\n\r\nThe mourner before him was no longer the employer; a being of\r\nanother race, eternally placed in antagonistic attitude; going\r\nthrough the world glittering like gold, with a stony heart within,\r\nwhich knew no sorrow but through the accidents of Trade; no longer\r\nthe enemy, the oppressor, but a very poor and desolate old man.\r\n\r\nThe sympathy for suffering, formerly so prevalent a feeling with\r\nhim, again filled John Barton\'s heart, and almost impelled him to\r\nspeak (as best he could) some earnest, tender words to the stern\r\nman, shaking in his agony.\r\n\r\nBut who was he, that he should utter sympathy or consolation?  The\r\ncause of all this woe.\r\n\r\nOh, blasting thought!  Oh, miserable remembrance!  He had forfeited\r\nall right to bind up his brother\'s wounds.\r\n\r\nStunned by the thought, he sank upon the seat, almost crushed with\r\nthe knowledge of the consequences of his own action; for he had no\r\nmore imagined to himself the blighted home, and the miserable\r\nparents, than does the soldier, who discharges his musket, picture\r\nto himself the desolation of the wife, and the pitiful cries of the\r\nhelpless little ones, who are in an instant to be made widowed and\r\nfatherless.\r\n\r\nTo intimidate a class of men, known only to those below them as\r\ndesirous to obtain the greatest quantity of work for the lowest\r\nwages--at most to remove an overbearing partner from an obnoxious\r\nfirm, who stood in the way of those who struggled as well as they\r\nwere able to obtain their rights--this was the light in which John\r\nBarton had viewed his deed; and even so viewing it, after the\r\nexcitement had passed away, the Avenger, the sure Avenger, had found\r\nhim out.\r\n\r\nBut now he knew that he had killed a man, and a brother--now he knew\r\nthat no good thing could come out of this evil, even to the\r\nsufferers whose cause he had so blindly espoused.\r\n\r\nHe lay across the table, broken-hearted.  Every fresh quivering sob\r\nof Mr. Carson\'s stabbed him to his soul.\r\n\r\nHe felt execrated by all; and as if he could never lay bare the\r\nperverted reasonings which had made the performance of undoubted sin\r\nappear a duty.  The longing to plead some faint excuse grew stronger\r\nand stronger.  He feebly raised his head, and looking at Job Legh,\r\nhe whispered out--\r\n\r\n"I did not know what I was doing, Job Legh; God knows I didn\'t!  O\r\nsir!" said he wildly, almost throwing himself at Mr. Carson\'s feet,\r\n"say you forgive me the anguish I now see I have caused you.  I care\r\nnot for pain, or death, you know I don\'t; but oh, man! forgive me\r\nthe trespass I have done!"\r\n\r\n"Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them that trespass against\r\nus," said Job, solemnly and low, as if in prayer: as if the words\r\nwere suggested by those John Barton had used.\r\n\r\nMr. Carson took his hands away from his face.  I would rather see\r\ndeath than the ghastly gloom which darkened that countenance.\r\n\r\n"Let my trespasses be unforgiven, so that I may have vengeance for\r\nmy son\'s murder."\r\n\r\nThere are blasphemous actions as well as blasphemous words: all\r\nunloving, cruel deeds, are acted blasphemy.\r\n\r\nMr. Carson left the house.  And John Barton lay on the ground as one\r\ndead.\r\n\r\nThey lifted him up, and almost hoping that that deep trance might be\r\nto him the end of all earthly things, they bore him to his bed.\r\n\r\nFor a time they listened with divided attention to his faint\r\nbreathings; for in each hasty hurried step that echoed in the street\r\noutside, they thought they heard the approach of the officers of\r\njustice.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Carson left the house he was dizzy with agitation; the hot\r\nblood went careering through his frame.  He could not see the deep\r\nblue of the night-heavens for the fierce pulses which throbbed in\r\nhis head.  And partly to steady and calm himself, he leaned against\r\na railing, and looked up into those calm majestic depths with all\r\ntheir thousand stars.\r\n\r\nAnd by-and-by his own voice returned upon him, as if the last words\r\nhe had spoken were being uttered through all that infinite space;\r\nbut in their echoes there was a tone of unutterable sorrow.\r\n\r\n"Let my trespasses be unforgiven, so that I may have vengeance for\r\nmy son\'s murder."\r\n\r\nHe tried to shake off the spiritual impression made by this\r\nimagination.  He was feverish and ill,--and no wonder.\r\n\r\nSo he turned to go homewards; not, as he had threatened, to the\r\npolice-office.  After all (he told himself), that would do in the\r\nmorning.  No fear of the man\'s escaping, unless he escaped to the\r\ngrave.\r\n\r\nSo he tried to banish the phantom voices and shapes which came\r\nunbidden to his brain, and to recall his balance of mind by walking\r\ncalmly and slowly, and noticing everything which struck his senses.\r\n\r\nIt was a warm soft evening in spring, and there were many persons in\r\nthe streets.  Among others a nurse with a little girl in her charge,\r\nconveying her home from some children\'s gaiety; a dance most likely,\r\nfor the lovely little creature was daintily decked out in soft,\r\nsnowy muslin; and her fairy feet tripped along by her nurse\'s side\r\nas if to the measure of some tune she had lately kept time to.\r\n\r\nSuddenly up behind her there came a rough, rude errand-boy, nine or\r\nten years of age; a giant he looked by the fairy-child, as she\r\nfluttered along.  I don\'t know how it was, but in some awkward way\r\nhe knocked the poor little girl down upon the hard pavement as he\r\nbrushed rudely past, not much caring whom he hurt, so that he got\r\nalong.\r\n\r\nThe child arose, sobbing with pain; and not without cause, for blood\r\nwas dropping down from the face, but a minute before so fair and\r\nbright--dropping down on the pretty frock, making those scarlet\r\nmarks so terrible to little children.\r\n\r\nThe nurse, a powerful woman, had seized the boy, just as Mr. Carson\r\n(who had seen the whole transaction) came up.\r\n\r\n"You naughty little rascal!  I\'ll give you to a policeman, that I\r\nwill!  Do you see how you\'ve hurt the little girl?  Do you?"\r\naccompanying every sentence with a violent jerk of passionate anger.\r\n\r\nThe lad looked hard and defying; but withal terrified at the threat\r\nof the policeman, those ogres of our streets to all unlucky urchins.\r\nThe nurse saw it, and began to drag him along, with a view of making\r\nwhat she called "a wholesome impression."\r\n\r\nHis terror increased and with it his irritation; when the little\r\nsweet face, choking away its sobs, pulled down nurse\'s head and\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n"Please, dear nurse, I\'m not much hurt; it was very silly to cry,\r\nyou know.  He did not mean to do it.  HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT HE WAS\r\nDOING, did you, little boy?  Nurse won\'t call a policeman, so don\'t\r\nbe frightened."  And she put up her little mouth to be kissed by her\r\ninjurer, just as she had been taught to do at home to "make peace."\r\n\r\n"That lad will mind, and be more gentle for the time to come, I\'ll\r\nbe bound, thanks to that little lady," said a passer-by, half to\r\nhimself, and half to Mr. Carson, whom he had observed to notice the\r\nscene.\r\n\r\nThe latter took no apparent heed of the remark, but passed on.  But\r\nthe child\'s pleading reminded him of the low, broken voice he had so\r\nlately heard, penitently and humbly urging the same extenuation of\r\nhis great guilt.\r\n\r\n"I did not know what I was doing."\r\n\r\nHe had some association with those words; he had heard, or read of\r\nthat plea somewhere before.  Where was it?\r\n\r\n"Could it be?"--\r\n\r\nHe would look when he got home.  So when he entered his house he\r\nwent straight and silently upstairs to his library, and took down\r\nthe great, large, handsome Bible, all grand and golden, with its\r\nleaves adhering together from the bookbinder\'s press, so little had\r\nit been used.\r\n\r\nOn the first page (which fell open to Mr. Carson\'s view) were\r\nwritten the names of his children, and his own.\r\n\r\n"Henry John, son of the above John and Elizabeth Carson.\r\n               Born Sept. 29th, 1815."\r\n\r\nTo make the entry complete, his death should now be added.  But the\r\npage became hidden by the gathering mist of tears.\r\n\r\nThought upon thought, and recollection upon recollection came\r\ncrowding in, from the remembrance of the proud day when he had\r\npurchased the costly book, in order to write down the birth of the\r\nlittle babe of a day old.\r\n\r\nHe laid his head down on the open page, and let the tears fall\r\nslowly on the spotless leaves.\r\n\r\nHis son\'s murderer was discovered; had confessed his guilt, and yet\r\n(strange to say) he could not hate him with the vehemence of hatred\r\nhe had felt, when he had imagined him a young man, full of lusty\r\nlife, defying all laws, human and divine.  In spite of his desire to\r\nretain the revengeful feeling he considered as a duty to his dead\r\nson, something of pity would steal in for the poor, wasted skeleton\r\nof a man, the smitten creature, who had told him of his sin, and\r\nimplored his pardon that night.\r\n\r\nIn the days of his childhood and youth, Mr. Carson had been\r\naccustomed to poverty; but it was honest, decent poverty; not the\r\ngrinding squalid misery he had remarked in every part of John\r\nBarton\'s house, and which contrasted strangely with the pompous\r\nsumptuousness of the room in which he now sat.  Unaccustomed wonder\r\nfilled his mind at the reflection of the different lots of the\r\nbrethren of mankind.\r\n\r\nThen he roused himself from his reverie, and turned to the object of\r\nhis search--the Gospel, where he half expected to find the tender\r\npleading: "They know not what they do."\r\n\r\nIt was murk midnight by this time, and the house was still and\r\nquiet.  There was nothing to interrupt the old man in his unwonted\r\nstudy.\r\n\r\nYears ago, the Gospel had been his task-book in learning to read.\r\nSo many years ago, that he had become familiar with the events\r\nbefore he could comprehend the Spirit that made the Life.\r\n\r\nHe fell to the narrative now afresh, with all the interest of a\r\nlittle child.  He began at the beginning, and read on almost\r\ngreedily, understanding for the first time the full meaning of the\r\nstory.  He came to the end; the awful End.  And there were the\r\nhaunting words of pleading.\r\n\r\nHe shut the book, and thought deeply.\r\n\r\nAll night long, the Archangel combated with the Demon.\r\n\r\nAll night long, others watched by the bed of Death.  John Barton had\r\nrevived to fitful intelligence.  He spoke at times with even\r\nsomething of his former energy; and in the racy Lancashire dialect\r\nhe had always used when speaking freely.\r\n\r\n"You see I\'ve so often been hankering after the right way; and it\'s\r\na hard one for a poor man to find.  At least it\'s been so to me.  No\r\none learned me, and no one telled me.  When I was a little chap they\r\ntaught me to read, and then they never gave no books; only I heard\r\nsay the Bible was a good book.  So when I grew thoughtful, and\r\npuzzled, I took to it.  But you\'d never believe black was black, or\r\nnight was night, when you saw all about you acting as if black was\r\nwhite, and night was day.  It\'s not much I can say for myself in\r\nt\'other world.  God forgive me; but I can say this, I would fain\r\nhave gone after the Bible rules if I\'d seen folk credit it; they all\r\nspoke up for it, and went and did clean contrary.  In those days I\r\nwould ha\' gone about wi\' my Bible, like a little child, my finger in\r\nth\' place, and asking the meaning of this or that text, and no one\r\ntold me.  Then I took out two or three texts as clear as glass, and\r\nI tried to do what they bid me do.  But I don\'t know how it was,\r\nmasters and men, all alike cared no more for minding those texts,\r\nthan I did for th\' Lord Mayor of London; so I grew to think it must\r\nbe a sham put upon poor ignorant folk, women, and such like.\r\n\r\n"It was not long I tried to live Gospel-wise, but it was liker\r\nheaven than any other bit of earth has been.  I\'d old Alice to\r\nstrengthen me; but every one else said, \'Stand up for thy rights, or\r\nthou\'lt never get \'em\'; and wife and children never spoke, but their\r\nhelplessness cried aloud, and I was driven to do as others did--and\r\nthen Tom died.  You know all about that--I\'m getting scant o\'\r\nbreath, and blind-like."\r\n\r\nThen again he spoke, after some minutes of hushed silence.\r\n\r\n"All along it came natural to love folk, though now I am what I am.\r\nI think one time I could e\'en have loved the masters if they\'d ha\'\r\nletten me; that was in my Gospel-days, afore my child died o\'\r\nhunger.  I was tore in two oftentimes, between my sorrow for poor\r\nsuffering folk, and my trying to love them as caused their\r\nsufferings (to my mind).\r\n\r\n"At last I gave it up in despair, trying to make folks\' actions\r\nsquare wi\' th\' Bible; and I thought I\'d no longer labour at\r\nfollowing th\' Bible mysel.  I\'ve said all this afore, maybe.  But\r\nfrom that time I\'ve dropped down, down--down."\r\n\r\nAfter that he only spoke in broken sentences.\r\n\r\n"I did not think he\'d been such an old man,--oh! that he had but\r\nforgiven me,"--and then came earnest, passionate, broken words of\r\nprayer.\r\n\r\nJob Legh had gone home like one struck down with the unexpected\r\nshock.\r\n\r\nMary and Jem together waited the approach of death; but as the final\r\nstruggle drew on, and morning dawned, Jem suggested some alleviation\r\nto the gasping breath, to purchase which he left the house in search\r\nof a druggist\'s shop, which should be open at that early hour.\r\n\r\nDuring his absence, Barton grew worse; he had fallen across the bed,\r\nand his breathing seemed almost stopped; in vain did Mary strive to\r\nraise him, her sorrow and exhaustion had rendered her too weak.\r\n\r\nSo, on hearing some one enter the house-place below, she cried out\r\nfor Jem to come to her assistance.\r\n\r\nA step, which was not Jem\'s, came up the stairs.\r\n\r\nMr. Carson stood in the doorway.  In one instant he comprehended the\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nHe raised up the powerless frame; and the departing soul looked out\r\nof the eyes with gratitude.  He held the dying man propped in his\r\narms.\r\n\r\nJohn Barton folded his hands as if in prayer.\r\n\r\n"Pray for us," said Mary, sinking on her knees, and forgetting in\r\nthat solemn hour all that had divided her father and Mr. Carson.\r\n\r\nNo other words would suggest themselves than some of those he had\r\nread only a few hours before--\r\n\r\n"God be merciful to us sinners.--Forgive us our trespasses as we\r\nforgive them that trespass against us!"\r\n\r\nAnd when the words were said, John Barton lay a corpse in Mr.\r\nCarson\'s arms.\r\n\r\nSo ended the tragedy of a poor man\'s life.\r\n\r\n\r\nMary knew nothing more for many minutes.  When she recovered\r\nconsciousness, she found herself supported by Jem on the "settle" in\r\nthe house-place.  Job and Mr. Carson were there, talking together\r\nlowly and solemnly.  Then Mr. Carson bade farewell and left the\r\nhouse; and Job said aloud, but as if speaking to himself--\r\n\r\n"God has heard that man\'s prayer.  He has comforted him."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVI.   JEM\'S INTERVIEW WITH MR. DUNCOMBE.\r\n\r\n     "The first dark day of nothingness,\r\n      The last of danger and distress."\r\n                                      --BYRON.\r\n\r\nAlthough Mary had hardly been conscious of her thoughts, and it had\r\nbeen more like a secret instinct informing her soul, than the result\r\nof any process of reasoning, she had felt for some time (ever since\r\nher return from Liverpool, in fact), that for her father there was\r\nbut one thing to be desired and anticipated, and that was death!\r\n\r\nShe had seen that Conscience had given the mortal wound to his\r\nearthly frame; she did not dare to question of the infinite mercy of\r\nGod, what the Future Life would be to him.\r\n\r\nThough at first desolate and stunned by the blow which had fallen on\r\nherself, she was resigned and submissive as soon as she recovered\r\nstrength enough to ponder and consider a little; and you may be sure\r\nthat no tenderness or love was wanting on Jem\'s part, and no\r\nconsideration and sympathy on that of Job and Margaret to soothe and\r\ncomfort the girl who now stood alone in the world as far as blood\r\nrelations were concerned.\r\n\r\nShe did not ask or care to know what arrangements they were making\r\nin whispered tones with regard to the funeral.  She put herself into\r\ntheir hands with the trust of a little child; glad to be undisturbed\r\nin the reveries and remembrances which filled her eyes with tears,\r\nand caused them to fall quietly, down her pale cheeks.\r\n\r\nIt was the longest day she had ever known in her life; every change\r\nand every occupation was taken away from her: but perhaps the\r\nlength of quiet time thus afforded was really good, although its\r\nduration weighed upon her; for by this means she contemplated her\r\nsituation in every light, and fully understood that the morning\'s\r\nevent had left her an orphan; and thus she was spared the pangs\r\ncaused to us by the occurrence of death in the evening, just before\r\nwe should naturally, in the usual course of events, lie down to\r\nslumber.  For in such case, worn out by anxiety, and it may be by\r\nmuch watching, our very excess of grief rocks itself to sleep,\r\nbefore we have had time to realise its cause; and we waken, with a\r\nstart of agony like a fresh stab, to the consciousness of the one\r\nawful vacancy, which shall never, while the world endures, be filled\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThe day brought its burden of duty to Mrs. Wilson.  She felt bound\r\nby regard, as well as by etiquette, to go and see her future\r\ndaughter-in-law.  And by an old association of ideas (perhaps of\r\ndeath with churchyards, and churches with Sunday) she thought it\r\nnecessary to put on her best, and latterly unused clothes, the\r\nairing of which on a little clothes-horse before the fire seemed to\r\ngive her a not unpleasing occupation.\r\n\r\nWhen Jem returned home late in the evening succeeding John Barton\'s\r\ndeath, weary and oppressed with the occurrences and excitements of\r\nthe day, he found his mother busy about her mourning, and much\r\ninclined to talk.  Although he longed for quiet, he could not avoid\r\nsitting down and answering her questions.\r\n\r\n"Well, Jem, he\'s gone at last, is he?"\r\n\r\n"Yes.  How did you hear, mother?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Job came over here, and telled me, on his way to the\r\nundertaker\'s.  Did he make a fine end?"\r\n\r\nIt struck Jem that she had not heard of the confession which had\r\nbeen made by John Barton on his death-bed; he remembered Job Legh\'s\r\ndiscretion, and he determined that if it could be avoided his mother\r\nshould never hear of it.  Many of the difficulties to be anticipated\r\nin preserving the secret would be obviated, if he could induce his\r\nmother to fall into the plan he had named to Mary of emigrating to\r\nCanada.  The reasons which rendered this secrecy desirable related\r\nto the domestic happiness he hoped for.  With his mother\'s irritable\r\ntemper he could hardly expect that all allusion to the crime of John\r\nBarton would be for ever restrained from passing her lips, and he\r\nknew the deep trial which such references would be to Mary.\r\nAccordingly he resolved as soon as possible in the morning to go to\r\nJob and beseech his silence; he trusted that secrecy in that\r\nquarter, even if the knowledge had been extended to Margaret, might\r\nbe easily secured.\r\n\r\nBut what would be Mr. Carson\'s course?\r\n\r\nWere there any means by which he might be persuaded to spare John\r\nBarton\'s memory?\r\n\r\nHe was roused up from this train of thought by his mother\'s more\r\nirritated tone of voice.\r\n\r\n"Jem!" she was saying, "thou mightst just as well never be at a\r\ndeath-bed again, if thou cannot bring off more news about it; here\r\nhave I been by mysel all day (except when oud Job came in), but\r\nthinks I when Jem comes he\'ll be sure to be good company, seeing he\r\nwas in the house at the very time of the death; and here thou art,\r\nwithout a word to throw at a dog, much less thy mother: it\'s no\r\nuse thy going to a death-bed if thou cannot carry away any of the\r\nsayings!"\r\n\r\n"He did not make any, mother," replied Jem.\r\n\r\n"Well, to be sure!  So fond as he used to be of holding forth, to\r\nmiss such a fine opportunity that will never come again!  Did he die\r\neasy?"\r\n\r\n"He was very restless all night long," said Jem, reluctantly\r\nreturning to the thoughts of that time.\r\n\r\n"And in course thou plucked the pillow away?  Thou didst not!  Well!\r\nwith thy bringing up, and thy learning, thou mightst have known that\r\nwere the only help in such a case.  There were pigeons\' feathers in\r\nthe pillow, depend on\'t.  To think of two grown-up folk like you and\r\nMary, not knowing death could never come easy to a person lying on a\r\npillow with pigeons\' feathers in!"\r\n\r\nJem was glad to escape from all this talking, to the solitude and\r\nquiet of his own room, where he could lie and think uninterruptedly\r\nof what had happened and remained to be done.\r\n\r\nThe first thing was to seek an interview with Mr. Duncombe, his\r\nformer master.  Accordingly, early the next morning Jem set off on\r\nhis walk to the works, where for so many years his days had been\r\nspent; where for so long a time his thoughts had been thought, his\r\nhopes and fears experienced.  It was not a cheering feeling to\r\nremember that henceforward he was to be severed from all these\r\nfamiliar places; nor were his spirits enlivened by the evident\r\nfeelings of the majority of those who had been his fellow-workmen.\r\nAs he stood in the entrance to the foundry, awaiting Mr. Duncombe\'s\r\nleisure, many of those employed in the works passed him on their\r\nreturn from breakfast; and, with one or two exceptions, without any\r\nacknowledgment of former acquaintance beyond a distant nod at the\r\nutmost.\r\n\r\n"It is hard," said Jem to himself, with a bitter and indignant\r\nfeeling rising in his throat, "that let a man\'s life be what it may,\r\nfolk are so ready to credit the first word against him.  I could\r\nlive it down if I stayed in England; but then what would not Mary\r\nhave to bear?  Sooner or later the truth would out; and then she\r\nwould be a show to folk for many a day as John Barton\'s daughter.\r\nWell! God does not judge as hardly as man, that\'s one comfort for\r\nall of us!"\r\n\r\nMr. Duncombe did not believe in Jem\'s guilt, in spite of the silence\r\nin which he again this day heard the imputation of it; but he agreed\r\nthat under the circumstances it was better he should leave the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n"We have been written to by Government, as I think I told you\r\nbefore, to recommend an intelligent man, well acquainted with\r\nmechanics, as instrument-maker to the Agricultural College they are\r\nestablishing at Toronto, in Canada.  It is a comfortable\r\nappointment,--house,--land,--and a good percentage on the\r\ninstruments made.  I will show you the particulars if I can lay my\r\nhand on the letter, which I believe I must have left at home."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, sir.  No need for seeing the letter to say I\'ll accept\r\nit.  I must leave Manchester; and I\'d as lief quit England at once\r\nwhen I\'m about it."\r\n\r\n"Of course, Government will give you your passage; indeed, I believe\r\nan allowance would be made for a family if you had one; but you are\r\nnot a married man, I believe?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir, but"--Jem hung back from a confession with the awkwardness\r\nof a girl.\r\n\r\n"But"--said Mr. Duncombe, smiling, "you would like to be a married\r\nman before you go, I suppose; eh, Wilson?"\r\n\r\n"If you please, sir.  And there\'s my mother, too.  I hope she\'ll go\r\nwith us.  But I can pay her passage; no need to trouble Government."\r\n\r\n"Nay, nay!  I\'ll write to-day and recommend you; and say that you\r\nhave a family of two.  They\'ll never ask if the family goes upwards\r\nor downwards.  I shall see you again before you sail, I hope,\r\nWilson; though I believe they\'ll not allow you long to wait.  Come\r\nto my house next time; you\'ll find it pleasanter, I dare say.  These\r\nmen are so wrong-headed.  Keep up your heart!"\r\n\r\nJem felt that it was a relief to have this point settled; and that\r\nhe need no longer weigh reasons for and against his emigration.\r\n\r\nAnd with his path growing clearer and clearer before him the longer\r\nhe contemplated it, he went to see Mary, and if he judged it fit, to\r\ntell her what he had decided upon.  Margaret was sitting with her.\r\n\r\n"Grandfather wants to see you!" said she to Jem on his entrance.\r\n\r\n"And I want to see him," replied Jem, suddenly remembering his last\r\nnight\'s determination to enjoin secrecy on Job Legh.\r\n\r\nSo he hardly stayed to kiss poor Mary\'s sweet woe-begone face, but\r\ntore himself away from his darling to go to the old man, who awaited\r\nhim impatiently.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve getten a note from Mr. Carson," exclaimed Job the moment he\r\nsaw Jem; "and, man alive, he wants to see thee and me!  For sure,\r\nthere\'s no more mischief up, is there?" said he, looking at Jem with\r\nan expression of wonder.  But if any suspicion mingled for an\r\ninstant with the thoughts that crossed Job\'s mind, it was\r\nimmediately dispelled by Jem\'s honest, fearless, open countenance.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t guess what he\'s wanting, poor old chap," answered he.\r\n"Maybe there\'s some point he\'s not yet satisfied on; maybe--but it\'s\r\nno use guessing; let\'s be off."\r\n\r\n"It wouldn\'t be better for thee to be scarce a bit, would it, and\r\nleave me to go and find out what\'s up?  He has, perhaps, getten some\r\ncrotchet into his head thou\'rt an accomplice, and is laying a trap\r\nfor thee."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not afeard!" said Jem; "I\'ve done nought wrong, and know nought\r\nwrong, about yon poor dead lad; though I\'ll own I had evil thoughts\r\nonce on a time.  Folk can\'t mistake long if once they\'ll search into\r\nthe truth.  I\'ll go and give the old gentleman all the satisfaction\r\nin my power, now it can injure no one.  I\'d my reasons for wanting\r\nto see him besides, and it all falls in right enough for me."\r\n\r\nJob was a little reassured by Jem\'s boldness; but still, if the\r\ntruth must be told, he wished the young man would follow his advice,\r\nand leave him to sound Mr. Carson\'s intentions.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Jane Wilson had donned her Sunday suit of black, and set\r\noff on her errand of condolence.  She felt nervous and uneasy at the\r\nidea of the moral sayings and texts which she fancied were expected\r\nfrom visitors on occasions like the present; and prepared many a\r\ngood set speech as she walked towards the house of mourning.\r\n\r\nAs she gently opened the door, Mary, sitting idly by the fire,\r\ncaught a glimpse of her,--of Jem\'s mother,--of the early friend of\r\nher dead parents,--of the kind minister to many a little want in\r\ndays of childhood,--and rose and came and fell about her neck, with\r\nmany a sob and moan, saying--\r\n\r\n"Oh, he\'s gone--he\'s dead--all gone--all dead, and I am left alone!"\r\n\r\n"Poor wench! poor, poor wench!" said Jane Wilson, tenderly kissing\r\nher.  "Thou\'rt not alone; so donnot take on so.  I\'ll say nought of\r\nHim who\'s above, for thou knowest He is ever the orphan\'s friend;\r\nbut think on Jem! nay, Mary, dear, think on me!  I\'m but a frabbit\r\nwoman at times, but I\'ve a heart within me through all my temper,\r\nand thou shalt be as a daughter henceforward,--as mine own ewe-lamb.\r\nJem shall not love thee better in his way, than I will in mine; and\r\nthou\'lt bear with my turns, Mary, knowing that in my soul God sees\r\nthe love that shall ever be thine, if thou\'lt take me for thy\r\nmother, and speak no more of being alone."\r\n\r\nMrs. Wilson was weeping herself long before she had ended this\r\nspeech, which was so different to all she had planned to say, and\r\nfrom all the formal piety she had laid in store for the visit; for\r\nthis was heart\'s piety, and needed no garnish of texts to make it\r\ntrue religion, pure and undefiled.\r\n\r\nThey sat together on the same chair, their arms encircling each\r\nother; they wept for the same dead; they had the same hope, and\r\ntrust, and overflowing love in the living.\r\n\r\nFrom that time forward, hardly a passing cloud dimmed the happy\r\nconfidence of their intercourse; even by Jem would his mother\'s\r\ntemper sooner be irritated than by Mary; before the latter she\r\nrepressed her occasional nervous ill-humour till the habit of\r\nindulging it was perceptibly decreased.\r\n\r\nYears afterwards, in conversation with Jem, he was startled by a\r\nchance expression which dropped from his mother\'s lips; it implied a\r\nknowledge of John Barton\'s crime.  It was many a long day since they\r\nhad seen any Manchester people who could have revealed the secret\r\n(if indeed it was known in Manchester, against which Jem had guarded\r\nin every possible way).  And he was led to inquire first as to the\r\nextent, and then as to the source of her knowledge.  It was Mary\r\nherself who had told all.\r\n\r\nFor on the morning to which this chapter principally relates, as\r\nMary sat weeping, and as Mrs. Wilson comforted her by every\r\ntenderest word and caress, she revealed, to the dismayed and\r\nastonished Jane, the sting of her deep sorrow; the crime which\r\nstained her dead father\'s memory.\r\n\r\nShe was quite unconscious that Jem had kept it secret from his\r\nmother; she had imagined it bruited abroad as the suspicion against\r\nher lover had been; so word after word (dropped from her lips in the\r\nsupposition that Mrs. Wilson knew all) had told the tale and\r\nrevealed the cause of her deep anguish; deeper than is ever caused\r\nby death alone.\r\n\r\nOn large occasions like the present, Mrs. Wilson\'s innate generosity\r\ncame out.  Her weak and ailing frame imparted its irritation to her\r\nconduct in small things, and daily trifles; but she had deep and\r\nnoble sympathy with great sorrows, and even at the time that Mary\r\nspoke she allowed no expression of surprise or horror to escape her\r\nlips.  She gave way to no curiosity as to the untold details; she\r\nwas as secret and trustworthy as her son himself; and if in years to\r\ncome her anger was occasionally excited against Mary, and she, on\r\nrare occasions, yielded to ill-temper against her daughter-in-law,\r\nshe would upbraid her for extravagance, or stinginess, or\r\nover-dressing, or under-dressing, or too much mirth or too much\r\ngloom, but never, never in her most uncontrolled moments did she\r\nallude to any one of the circumstances relating to Mary\'s flirtation\r\nwith Harry Carson, or his murderer; and always when she spoke of\r\nJohn Barton, named him with the respect due to his conduct before\r\nthe last, miserable, guilty month of his life.\r\n\r\nTherefore it came like a blow to Jem, when, after years had passed\r\naway, he gathered his mother\'s knowledge of the whole affair.  From\r\nthe day when he learnt (not without remorse) what hidden depths of\r\nself-restraint she had in her soul, his manner to her, always tender\r\nand respectful, became reverential; and it was more than ever a\r\nloving strife between him and Mary which should most contribute\r\ntowards the happiness of the declining years of their mother.\r\n\r\nBut I am speaking of the events which have occurred only lately,\r\nwhile I have yet many things to tell you that happened six or seven\r\nyears ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVII.   DETAILS CONNECTED WITH THE MURDER.\r\n\r\n     "The rich man dines, while the poor man pines,\r\n        And eats his heart away;\r\n     \'They teach us lies,\' he sternly cries,\r\n       \'Would BROTHERS do as they?\'"\r\n                                       --The Dream.\r\n\r\nMr. Carson stood at one of the breathing-moments of life.  The\r\nobject of the toils, the fears, and the wishes of his past years,\r\nwas suddenly hidden from his sight,--vanished into the deep mystery\r\nwhich circumscribes existence.  Nay, even the vengeance which he had\r\ncherished, taken away from before his eyes, as by the hand of God.\r\n\r\nEvents like these would have startled the most thoughtless into\r\nreflection, much more such a man as Mr. Carson, whose mind, if not\r\nenlarged, was energetic; indeed, whose very energy, having been\r\nhitherto the cause of the employment of his powers in only one\r\ndirection, had prevented him from becoming largely and\r\nphilosophically comprehensive in his views.\r\n\r\nBut now the foundations of his past life were razed to the ground,\r\nand the place they had once occupied was sown with salt, to be\r\nrebuilt no more for ever.  It was like the change from this Life to\r\nthat other hidden one, when so many of the motives which have\r\nactuated all our earthly existence, will have become more fleeting\r\nthan the shadows of a dream.  With a wrench of his soul from the\r\npast, so much of which was as nothing, and worse than nothing to him\r\nnow, Mr. Carson took some hours, after he had witnessed the death of\r\nhis son\'s murderer, to consider his situation.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly, while he was deliberating, and searching for motives\r\nwhich should be effective to compel him to exertion and action once\r\nmore; while he contemplated the desire after riches, social\r\ndistinction, a name among the merchant-princes amidst whom he moved,\r\nand saw these false substances fade away into the shadows they truly\r\nare, and one by one disappear into the grave of his son,--suddenly,\r\nI say, the thought arose within him that more yet remained to be\r\nlearned about the circumstances and feelings which had prompted John\r\nBarton\'s crime; and when once this mournful curiosity was excited,\r\nit seemed to gather strength in every moment that its gratification\r\nwas delayed.  Accordingly he sent a message to summon Job Legh and\r\nJem Wilson, from whom he promised himself some elucidation of what\r\nwas as yet unexplained; while he himself set forth to call on Mr.\r\nBridgnorth, whom he knew to have been Jem\'s attorney, with a\r\nglimmering suspicion intruding on his mind, which he strove to\r\nrepel, that Jem might have had some share in his son\'s death.\r\n\r\nHe had returned before his summoned visitors arrived; and had time\r\nenough to recur to the evening on which John Barton had made his\r\nconfession.  He remembered with mortification how he had forgotten\r\nhis proud reserve, and his habitual concealment of his feelings, and\r\nhad laid bare his agony of grief in the presence of these two men\r\nwho were coming to see him by his desire; and he entrenched himself\r\nbehind stiff barriers of self-control, through which he hoped no\r\nappearance of emotion would force its way in the conversation he\r\nanticipated.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, when the servant announced that two men were there by\r\nappointment to speak to him, and he had desired that they might be\r\nshown into the library where he sat, any watcher might have\r\nperceived by the trembling hands, and shaking head, not only how\r\nmuch he was aged by the occurrences of the last few weeks, but also\r\nhow much he was agitated at the thought of the impending interview.\r\n\r\nBut he so far succeeded in commanding himself at first, as to appear\r\nto Jem Wilson and Job Legh one of the hardest and most haughty men\r\nthey had ever spoken to, and to forfeit all the interest which he\r\nhad previously excited in their minds by his unreserved display of\r\ndeep and genuine feeling.\r\n\r\nWhen he had desired them to be seated, he shaded his face with his\r\nhand for an instant before speaking.\r\n\r\n"I have been calling on Mr. Bridgnorth this morning," said he, at\r\nlast; "as I expected, he can give me but little satisfaction on some\r\npoints respecting the occurrence on the 18th of last month which I\r\ndesire to have cleared up.  Perhaps you two can tell me what I want\r\nto know.  As intimate friends of Barton\'s you probably know, or can\r\nconjecture a good deal.  Have no scruple as to speaking the truth.\r\nWhat you say in this room shall never be named again by me.\r\nBesides, you are aware that the law allows no one to be tried twice\r\nfor the same offence."\r\n\r\nHe stopped for a minute, for the mere act of speaking was fatiguing\r\nto him after the excitement of the last few days.\r\n\r\nJob Legh took the opportunity of speaking.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not going to be affronted either for myself or Jem at what\r\nyou\'ve just now been saying about the truth.  You don\'t know us, and\r\nthere\'s an end on\'t; only it\'s as well for folk to think others good\r\nand true until they\'re proved contrary.  Ask what you like, sir,\r\nI\'ll answer for it we\'ll either tell truth or hold our tongues."\r\n\r\n"I beg your pardon," said Mr. Carson, slightly bowing his head.\r\n"What I wish to know was," referring to a slip of paper he held in\r\nhis hand, and shaking so much he could hardly adjust his glasses to\r\nhis eyes, "whether you, Wilson, can explain how Barton came\r\npossessed of your gun.  I believe you refused this explanation to\r\nMr. Bridgnorth?"\r\n\r\n"I did, sir!  If I had said what I knew then, I saw it would\r\ncriminate Barton, and so I refused telling aught.  To you, sir, now\r\nI will tell everything and anything; only it is but little.  The gun\r\nwas my father\'s before it was mine, and long ago he and John Barton\r\nhad a fancy for shooting at the gallery; and they used always to\r\ntake this gun, and brag that though it was old-fashioned it was\r\nsure."\r\n\r\nJem saw with self-upbraiding pain how Mr. Carson winced at these\r\nlast words, but at each irrepressible and involuntary evidence of\r\nfeeling, the hearts of the two men warmed towards him.  Jem went on\r\nspeaking.\r\n\r\n"One day in the week--I think it was on the Wednesday,--yes, it\r\nwas--it was on St. Patrick\'s day, I met John just coming out of our\r\nhouse, as I were going to my dinner.  Mother was out, and he\'d found\r\nno one in.  He said he\'d come to borrow the old gun, and that he\'d\r\nhave made bold, and taken it, but it was not to be seen.  Mother was\r\nafraid of it, so after father\'s death (for while he were alive, she\r\nseemed to think he could manage it) I had carried it to my own room.\r\nI went up and fetched it for John, who stood outside the door all\r\nthe time."\r\n\r\n"What did he say he wanted it for?" asked Mr. Carson hastily.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think he spoke when I gave it him.  At first he muttered\r\nsomething about the shooting gallery, and I never doubted but that\r\nit was for practice there, as I knew he had done years before."\r\n\r\nMr. Carson had strung up his frame to an attitude of upright\r\nattention while Jem was speaking; now the tension relaxed, and he\r\nsank back in his chair, weak and powerless.\r\n\r\nHe rose up again, however, as Jem went on, anxious to give every\r\nparticular which could satisfy the bereaved father.\r\n\r\n"I never knew for what he wanted the gun till I was taken up,--I do\r\nnot know yet why he wanted it.  No one would have had me get out of\r\nthe scrape by implicating an old friend,--my father\'s old friend,\r\nand the father of the girl I loved.  So I refused to tell Mr.\r\nBridgnorth aught about it, and would not have named it now to any\r\none but you."\r\n\r\nJem\'s face became very red at the allusion he made to Mary, but his\r\nhonest, fearless eyes had met Mr. Carson\'s penetrating gaze\r\nunflinchingly, and had carried conviction of his innocence and\r\ntruthfulness.  Mr. Carson felt certain that he had heard all that\r\nJem could tell.  Accordingly he turned to Job Legh.\r\n\r\n"You were in the room the whole time while Barton was speaking to\r\nme, I think?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir," answered Job.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll excuse my asking plain and direct questions; the information\r\nI am gaining is really a relief to my mind, I don\'t know how, but it\r\nis,--will you tell me if you had any idea of Barton\'s guilt in this\r\nmatter before?"\r\n\r\n"None whatever, so help me God!" said Job solemnly.  "To tell truth\r\n(and axing your forgiveness, Jem), I had never got quite shut of the\r\nnotion that Jem here had done it.  At times I was as clear of his\r\ninnocence as I was of my own; and whenever I took to reasoning about\r\nit, I saw he could not have been the man that did it.  Still I never\r\nthought of Barton."\r\n\r\n"And yet by his confession he must have been absent at the time,"\r\nsaid Mr. Carson, referring to his slip of paper.\r\n\r\n"Ay, and for many a day after,--I can\'t rightly say how long.  But\r\nstill, you see, one\'s often blind to many a thing that lies right\r\nunder one\'s nose, till it\'s pointed out.  And till I heard what John\r\nBarton had to say yon night, I could not have seen what reason he\r\nhad for doing it; while in the case of Jem, any one who looked at\r\nMary Barton might have seen a cause for jealousy clear enough."\r\n\r\n"Then you believe that Barton had no knowledge of my son\'s\r\nunfortunate"--he looked at Jem--"of his attentions to Mary Barton.\r\nThis young man, Wilson, has heard of them, you see."\r\n\r\n"The person who told me said clearly she neither had, nor would tell\r\nMary\'s father," interposed Jem.  "I don\'t believe he\'d ever heard of\r\nit; he weren\'t a man to keep still in such a matter, if he had."\r\n\r\n"Besides," said Job, "the reason he gave on his death-bed, so to\r\nspeak, was enough; \'specially to those who knew him."\r\n\r\n"You mean his feelings regarding the treatment of the workmen by the\r\nmasters; you think he acted from motives of revenge, in consequence\r\nof the part my son had taken in putting down the strike?"\r\n\r\n "Well, sir," replied Job, "it\'s hard to say: John Barton was not\r\na man to take counsel with people; nor did he make many words about\r\nhis doings.  So I can only judge from his way of thinking and\r\ntalking in general, never having heard him breathe a syllable\r\nconcerning this matter in particular.  You see he were sadly put\r\nabout to make great riches and great poverty square with Christ\'s\r\nGospel"--Job paused, in order to try and express what was clear\r\nenough in his own mind, as to the effect produced on John Barton by\r\nthe great and mocking contrasts presented by the varieties of human\r\ncondition.  Before he could find suitable words to explain his\r\nmeaning, Mr. Carson spoke. "You mean he was an Owenite; all for\r\nequality and community of goods, and that kind of absurdity."\r\n\r\n"No, no!  John Barton was no fool.  No need to tell him that were\r\nall men equal to-night, some would get the start by rising an hour\r\nearlier to-morrow.  Nor yet did he care for goods, nor wealth--no\r\nman less, so that he could get daily bread for him and his; but what\r\nhurt him sore, and rankled in him as long as I knew him (and, sir,\r\nit rankles in many a poor man\'s heart far more than the want of any\r\ncreature-comforts, and puts a sting into starvation itself), was\r\nthat those who wore finer clothes, and eat better food, and had more\r\nmoney in their pockets, kept him at arm\'s length, and cared not\r\nwhether his heart was sorry or glad; whether he lived or died,--\r\nwhether he was bound for heaven or hell.  It seemed hard to him that\r\na heap of gold should part him and his brother so far asunder.  For\r\nhe was a loving man before he grew mad with seeing such as he was\r\nslighted, as if Christ Himself had not been poor.  At one time, I\'ve\r\nheard him say, he felt kindly towards every man, rich or poor,\r\nbecause he thought they were all men alike.  But latterly he grew\r\naggravated with the sorrows and suffering that he saw, and which he\r\nthought the masters might help if they would."\r\n\r\n"That\'s the notion you\'ve all of you got," said Mr. Carson.  "Now,\r\nhow in the world can we help it?  We cannot regulate the demand for\r\nlabour.  No man or set of men can do it.  It depends on events which\r\nGod alone can control.  When there is no market for our goods, we\r\nsuffer just as much as you can do."\r\n\r\n"Not as much, I\'m sure, sir; though I\'m not given to Political\r\nEconomy, I know that much.  I\'m wanting in learning, I\'m aware; but\r\nI can use my eyes.  I never see the masters getting thin and haggard\r\nfor want of food; I hardly ever see them making much change in their\r\nway of living, though I don\'t doubt they\'ve got to do it in bad\r\ntimes.  But it\'s in things for show they cut short; while for such\r\nas me, it\'s in things for life we\'ve to stint.  For sure, sir,\r\nyou\'ll own it\'s come to a hard pass when a man would give aught in\r\nthe world for work to keep his children from starving, and can\'t get\r\na bit, if he\'s ever so willing to labour.  I\'m not up to talking as\r\nJohn Barton would have done, but that\'s clear to me at any rate."\r\n\r\n"My good man, just listen to me.  Two men live in solitude; one\r\nproduces loaves of bread, the other coats,--or what you will.  Now,\r\nwould it not be hard if the bread-producer were forced to give bread\r\nfor the coats, whether he wanted them or not, in order to furnish\r\nemployment to the other?  That is the simple form of the case;\r\nyou\'ve only to multiply the numbers.  There will come times of great\r\nchanges in the occupation of thousands, when improvements in\r\nmanufactures and machinery are made.  It\'s all nonsense talking,--it\r\nmust be so!"\r\n\r\nJob Legh pondered a few moments.\r\n\r\n"It\'s true it was a sore time for the hand-loom weavers when\r\npower-looms came in: them new-fangled things make a man\'s life\r\nlike a lottery; and yet I\'ll never misdoubt that power-looms and\r\nrailways, and all such-like inventions, are the gifts of God.  I\r\nhave lived long enough, too, to see that it is a part of His plan to\r\nsend suffering to bring out a higher good; but surely it\'s also a\r\npart of His plan that so much of the burden of the suffering as can\r\nbe should be lightened by those whom it is His pleasure to make\r\nhappy, and content in their own circumstances.  Of course it would\r\ntake a deal more thought and wisdom than me, or any other man has,\r\nto settle out of hand how this should be done.  But I\'m clear about\r\nthis, when God gives a blessing to be enjoyed, He gives it with a\r\nduty to be done; and the duty of the happy is to help the suffering\r\nto bear their woe."\r\n\r\n"Still facts have proved, and are daily proving, how much better it\r\nis for every man to be independent of help, and self-reliant," said\r\nMr. Carson thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n"You can never work facts as you would fixed quantities, and say,\r\ngiven two facts, and the product is so and so.  God has given men\r\nfeelings and passions which cannot be worked into the problem,\r\nbecause they are for ever changing and uncertain.  God has also made\r\nsome weak; not in any one way, but in all.  One is weak in body,\r\nanother in mind, another in steadiness of purpose, a fourth can\'t\r\ntell right from wrong, and so on; or if he can tell the right, he\r\nwants strength to hold by it.  Now, to my thinking, them that is\r\nstrong in any of God\'s gifts is meant to help the weak,--be hanged\r\nto the facts!  I ask your pardon, sir; I can\'t rightly explain the\r\nmeaning that is in me.  I\'m like a tap as won\'t run, but keeps\r\nletting it out drop by drop, so that you\'ve no notion of the force\r\nof what\'s within."\r\n\r\nJob looked and felt very sorrowful at the want of power in his\r\nwords, while the feeling within him was so strong and clear.\r\n\r\n"What you say is very true, no doubt," replied Mr. Carson; "but how\r\nwould you bring it to bear upon the masters\' conduct,--on my\r\nparticular case?" added he gravely.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not learned enough to argue.  Thoughts come into my head that\r\nI\'m sure are as true as Gospel, though maybe they don\'t follow each\r\nother like the Q.E.D. of a Proposition.  The masters has it on their\r\nown conscience,--you have it on yours, sir, to answer for to God\r\nwhether you\'ve done, and are doing all in your power to lighten the\r\nevils that seem always to hang on the trades by which you make your\r\nfortunes.  It\'s no business of mine, thank God.  John Barton took\r\nthe question in hand, and his answer to it was NO!  Then he grew\r\nbitter, and angry, and mad; and in his madness he did a great sin,\r\nand wrought a great woe; and repented him with tears of blood, and\r\nwill go through his penance humbly and meekly in t\'other place, I\'ll\r\nbe bound.  I never seed such bitter repentance as his that last\r\nnight."\r\n\r\nThere was a silence of many minutes.  Mr. Carson had covered his\r\nface, and seemed utterly forgetful of their presence; and yet they\r\ndid not like to disturb him by rising to leave the room.\r\n\r\nAt last he said, without meeting their sympathetic eyes--\r\n\r\n"Thank you both for coming,--and for speaking candidly to me.  I\r\nfear, Legh, neither you nor I have convinced each other, as to the\r\npower, or want of power, in the masters to remedy the evils the men\r\ncomplain of."\r\n\r\n"I\'m loth to vex you, sir, just now; but it was not the want of\r\npower I was talking on; what we all feel sharpest is the want of\r\ninclination to try and help the evils which come like blights at\r\ntimes over the manufacturing places, while we see the masters can\r\nstop work and not suffer.  If we saw the masters try for our sakes\r\nto find a remedy,--even if they were long about it,--even if they\r\ncould find no help, and at the end of all could only say, \'Poor\r\nfellows, our hearts are sore for ye; we\'ve done all we could, and\r\ncan\'t find a cure,\'--we\'d bear up like men through bad times.  No\r\none knows till they have tried, what power of bearing lies in them,\r\nif once they believe that men are caring for their sorrows and will\r\nhelp if they can.  If fellow-creatures can give nought but tears and\r\nbrave words, we take our trials straight from God, and we know\r\nenough of His love to put ourselves blind into His hands.  You say\r\nour talk has done no good.  I say it has.  I see the view you take\r\nof things from the place where you stand.  I can remember that, when\r\nthe time comes for judging you; I shan\'t think any longer, does he\r\nact right on my views of a thing, but does he act right on his own.\r\nIt has done me good in that way.  I\'m an old man, and may never see\r\nyou again; but I\'ll pray for you, and think on you and your trials,\r\nboth of your great wealth, and of your son\'s cruel death, many and\r\nmany a day to come; and I\'ll ask God to bless both to you now and\r\nfor evermore.  Amen.  Farewell!"\r\n\r\nJem had maintained a manly and dignified reserve ever since he had\r\nmade his open statement of all he knew.  Now both the men rose and\r\nbowed low, looking at Mr. Carson with the deep human interest they\r\ncould not fail to take in one who had endured and forgiven a deep\r\ninjury; and who struggled hard, as it was evident he did, to bear up\r\nlike a man under his affliction.\r\n\r\nHe bowed low in return to them.  Then he suddenly came forward and\r\nshook them by the hand; and thus, without a word more, they parted.\r\n\r\nThere are stages in the contemplation and endurance of great sorrow,\r\nwhich endow men with the same earnestness and clearness of thought\r\nthat in some of old took the form of Prophecy.  To those who have\r\nlarge capability of loving and suffering, united with great power of\r\nfirm endurance, there comes a time in their woe, when they are\r\nlifted out of the contemplation of their individual case into a\r\nsearching inquiry into the nature of their calamity, and the remedy\r\n(if remedy there be) which may prevent its recurrence to others as\r\nwell as to themselves.\r\n\r\nHence the beautiful, noble efforts which are from time to time\r\nbrought to light, as being continuously made by those who have once\r\nhung on the cross of agony, in order that others may not suffer as\r\nthey have done; one of the grandest ends which sorrow can\r\naccomplish; the sufferer wrestling with God\'s messenger until a\r\nblessing is left behind, not for one alone but for generations.\r\n\r\nIt took time before the stern nature of Mr. Carson was compelled to\r\nthe recognition of this secret of comfort, and that same sternness\r\nprevented his reaping any benefit in public estimation from the\r\nactions he performed; for the character is more easily changed than\r\nthe habits and manners originally formed by that character, and to\r\nhis dying day Mr. Carson was considered hard and cold by those who\r\nonly casually saw him or superficially knew him.  But those who were\r\nadmitted into his confidence were aware, that the wish that lay\r\nnearest to his heart was that none might suffer from the cause from\r\nwhich he had suffered; that a perfect understanding, and complete\r\nconfidence and love, might exist between masters and men; that the\r\ntruth might be recognised that the interests of one were the\r\ninterests of all, and, as such, required the consideration and\r\ndeliberation of all; that hence it was most desirable to have\r\neducated workers, capable of judging, not mere machines of ignorant\r\nmen: and to have them bound to their employers by the ties of\r\nrespect and affection, not by mere money bargains alone; in short,\r\nto acknowledge the Spirit of Christ as the regulating law between\r\nboth parties.\r\n\r\nMany of the improvements now in practice in the system of employment\r\nin Manchester, owe their origin to short, earnest sentences spoken\r\nby Mr. Carson.  Many and many yet to be carried into execution, take\r\ntheir birth from that stern, thoughtful mind, which submitted to be\r\ntaught by suffering.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVIII.   CONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n     "Touch us gently, gentle Time!\r\n        We\'ve not proud nor soaring wings,\r\n      Our ambition, our content,\r\n        Lies in simple things;\r\n      Humble voyagers are we\r\n      O\'er life\'s dim unsounded sea;\r\n        Touch us gently, gentle Time !"\r\n                                  --BARRY CORNWALL.\r\n\r\nNot many days after John Barton\'s funeral was over, all was arranged\r\nrespecting Jem\'s appointment at Toronto; and the time was fixed for\r\nhis sailing.  It was to take place almost immediately: yet much\r\nremained to be done; many domestic preparations were to be made; and\r\none great obstacle, anticipated by both Jem and Mary, to be removed.\r\nThis was the opposition they expected from Mrs. Wilson, to whom the\r\nplan had never yet been named.\r\n\r\nThey were most anxious that their home should continue ever to be\r\nhers, yet they feared that her dislike to a new country might be an\r\ninsuperable objection to this.  At last Jem took advantage of an\r\nevening of unusual placidity, as he sat alone with his mother just\r\nbefore going to bed, to broach the subject; and to his surprise she\r\nacceded willingly to his proposition of her accompanying himself and\r\nhis wife.\r\n\r\n"To be sure \'Merica is a long way to flit to; beyond London a good\r\nbit I reckon; and quite in foreign parts; but I\'ve never had no\r\nopinion of England, ever since they could be such fools as to take\r\nup a quiet chap like thee, and clap thee in prison.  Where you go,\r\nI\'ll go.  Perhaps in them Indian countries they\'ll know a\r\nwell-behaved lad when they see him; ne\'er speak a word more, lad,\r\nI\'ll go."\r\n\r\nTheir path became daily more smooth and easy; the present was clear\r\nand practicable, the future was hopeful; they had leisure of mind\r\nenough to turn to the past.\r\n\r\n"Jem!" said Mary to him, one evening as they sat in the twilight,\r\ntalking together in low happy voices till Margaret should come to\r\nkeep Mary company through the night, "Jem! you\'ve never yet told me\r\nhow you came to know about my naughty ways with poor young Mr.\r\nCarson."  She blushed for shame at the remembrance of her folly, and\r\nhid her head on his shoulder while he made answer.\r\n\r\n"Darling, I\'m almost loth to tell you; your aunt Esther told me."\r\n\r\n"Ah, I remember! but how did she know?  I was so put about that\r\nnight I did not think of asking her.  Where did you see her?  I\'ve\r\nforgotten where she lives."\r\n\r\nMary said all this in so open and innocent a manner, that Jem felt\r\nsure she knew not the truth respecting Esther, and he half hesitated\r\nto tell her.  At length he replied--\r\n\r\n"Where did you see Esther lately?  When?  Tell me, love, for you\'ve\r\nnever named it before, and I can\'t make it out."\r\n\r\n"Oh! it was that horrible night, which is like a dream."  And she\r\ntold him of Esther\'s midnight visit, concluding with, "We must go\r\nand see her before we leave, though I don\'t rightly know where to\r\nfind her."\r\n\r\n"Dearest Mary"--\r\n\r\n"What, Jem?" exclaimed she, alarmed by his hesitation.\r\n\r\n"Your poor aunt Esther has no home:--she\'s one of them miserable\r\ncreatures that walk the streets."  And he in his turn told of his\r\nencounter with Esther, with so many details that Mary was forced to\r\nbe convinced, although her heart rebelled against the belief.\r\n\r\n"Jem, lad!" said she vehemently, "we must find her out--we must hunt\r\nher up!"  She rose as if she was going on the search there and then.\r\n\r\n"What could we do, darling?" asked he, fondly restraining her.\r\n\r\n"Do!  Why! what could we NOT do, if we could but find her?  She\'s\r\nnone so happy in her ways, think ye, but what she\'d turn from them,\r\nif any one would lend her a helping hand.  Don\'t hold me, Jem; this\r\nis just the time for such as her to be out, and who knows but what I\r\nmight find her close to hand."\r\n\r\n"Stay, Mary, for a minute; I\'ll go out now and search for her if you\r\nwish, though it\'s but a wild chase.  You must not go.  It would be\r\nbetter to ask the police to-morrow.  But if I should find her, how\r\ncan I make her come with me?  Once before she refused, and said she\r\ncould not break off her drinking ways, come what might?"\r\n\r\n"You never will persuade her if you fear and doubt," said Mary, in\r\ntears.  "Hope yourself, and trust to the good that must be in her.\r\nSpeak to that,--she has it in her yet,--oh, bring her home, and we\r\nwill love her so, we\'ll make her good."\r\n\r\n"Yes!" said Jem, catching Mary\'s sanguine spirit; "she shall go to\r\nAmerica with us: and we\'ll help her to get rid of her sins.  I\'ll\r\ngo now, my precious darling, and if I can\'t find her, it\'s but\r\ntrying the police to-morrow.  Take care of your own sweet self,\r\nMary," said he, fondly kissing her before he went out.\r\n\r\nIt was not to be.  Jem wandered far and wide that night, but never\r\nmet Esther.  The next day he applied to the police; and at last they\r\nrecognised under his description of her, a woman known to them under\r\nthe name of the "Butterfly," from the gaiety of her dress a year or\r\ntwo ago.  By their help he traced out one of her haunts, a low\r\nlodging-house behind Peter-street.  He and his companion, a\r\nkind-hearted policeman, were admitted, suspiciously enough, by the\r\nlandlady, who ushered them into a large garret where twenty or\r\nthirty people of all ages and both sexes lay and dosed away the day,\r\nchoosing the evening and night for their trades of beggary,\r\nthieving, or prostitution.\r\n\r\n"I know the Butterfly was here," said she, looking round.  "She came\r\nin, the night before last, and said she had not a penny to get a\r\nplace for shelter; and that if she was far away in the country she\r\ncould steal aside and die in a copse, or a clough, like the wild\r\nanimals; but here the police would let no one alone in the streets,\r\nand she wanted a spot to die in, in peace.  It\'s a queer sort of\r\npeace we have here, but that night the room was uncommon empty, and\r\nI\'m not a hard-hearted woman (I wish I were, I could ha\' made a good\r\nthing out of it afore this if I were harder), so I sent her up--but\r\nshe\'s not here now, I think."\r\n\r\n"Was she very bad?" asked Jem.\r\n\r\n"Ay! nought but skin and bone, with a cough to tear her in two."\r\n\r\nThey made some inquiries, and found that in the restlessness of\r\napproaching death, she had longed to be once more in the open air,\r\nand had gone forth--where, no one seemed to be able to tell.\r\nLeaving many messages for her, and directions that he was to be sent\r\nfor if either the policeman or the landlady obtained any clue to her\r\nwhereabouts, Jem bent his steps towards Mary\'s house; for he had not\r\nseen her all that long day of search.  He told her of his\r\nproceedings and want of success; and both were saddened at the\r\nrecital, and sat silent for some time.\r\n\r\nAfter awhile they began talking over their plans.  In a day or two,\r\nMary was to give up house, and go and live for a week or so with Job\r\nLegh, until the time of her marriage, which would take place\r\nimmediately before sailing; they talked themselves back into silence\r\nand delicious reverie.  Mary sat by Jem, his arm around her waist,\r\nher head on his shoulder; and thought over the scenes which  had\r\npassed in that home she was so soon to leave for ever.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she felt Jem start, and started too without knowing why;\r\nshe tried to see his countenance, but the shades of evening had\r\ndeepened so much she could read no expression there.  It was turned\r\nto the window; she looked and saw a white face pressed against the\r\npanes on the outside, gazing intently into the dusky chamber.  While\r\nthey watched, as if fascinated by the appearance, and  unable to\r\nthink or stir, a film came over the bright, feverish, glittering\r\neyes outside, and the form sank down to the ground without a\r\nstruggle of instinctive resistance.\r\n\r\n"It is Esther!" exclaimed they, both at once.  They rushed outside;\r\nand, fallen into what appeared simply a heap of white or\r\nlight-coloured clothes, fainting or dead, lay the poor crushed\r\nButterfly--the once innocent Esther.  She had come (as a wounded\r\ndeer drags its heavy limbs once more to the green coolness of the\r\nlair in which it was born, there to die) to see the place familiar\r\nto her innocence, yet once again before her death.  Whether she was\r\nindeed alive or dead, they knew not now.\r\n\r\nJob came in with Margaret, for it was bedtime.  He said Esther\'s\r\npulse beat a little yet.  They carried her upstairs and laid her on\r\nMary\'s bed, not daring to undress her, lest any motion should\r\nfrighten the trembling life away; but it was all in vain.\r\n\r\nTowards midnight, she opened wide her eyes and looked around on the\r\nonce familiar room; Job Legh knelt by the bed praying aloud and\r\nfervently for her, but he stopped as he saw her roused look.  She\r\nsat up in bed with a sudden convulsive motion.\r\n\r\n"Has it been a dream, then?" asked she wildly.  Then with a habit,\r\nwhich came like instinct even in that awful dying hour, her hand\r\nsought for a locket which hung concealed in her bosom, and, finding\r\nthat, she knew all was true which had befallen her since last she\r\nlay an innocent girl on that bed.\r\n\r\nShe fell back, and spoke word never more.  She held the locket\r\ncontaining her child\'s hair still in her hand, and once or twice she\r\nkissed it with a long soft kiss.  She cried feebly and sadly as long\r\nas she had any strength to cry, and then she died.\r\n\r\nThey laid her in one grave with John Barton.  And there they lie\r\nwithout name, or initial, or date.  Only this verse is inscribed\r\nupon the stone which covers the remains of these two wanderers.\r\n\r\nPsalm ciii. v. 9.--"For He will not always chide, neither will He\r\nkeep His anger for ever."\r\n\r\n\r\nI see a long, low, wooden house, with room enough and to spare.  The\r\nold primeval trees are felled and gone for many a mile around; one\r\nalone remains to overshadow the gable-end of the cottage.  There is\r\na garden around the dwelling, and far beyond that stretches an\r\norchard.  The glory of an Indian summer is over all, making the\r\nheart leap at the sight of its gorgeous beauty.\r\n\r\nAt the door of the house, looking towards the town, stands Mary,\r\nwatching the return of her husband from his daily work; and while\r\nshe watches, she listens, smiling--\r\n\r\n     "Clap hands, daddy comes,\r\n      With his pocket full of plums,\r\n      And a cake for Johnnie."\r\n\r\nThen comes a crow of delight from Johnnie.  Then his grandmother\r\ncarries him to the door, and glories in seeing him resist his\r\nmother\'s blandishments to cling to her.\r\n\r\n"English letters!  \'Twas that made me so late!"\r\n\r\n"O Jem, Jem! don\'t hold them so tight!  What do they say?"\r\n\r\n"Why, some good news.  Come, give a guess what it is."\r\n\r\n"Oh, tell me!  I cannot guess," said Mary.\r\n\r\n"Then you give it up, do you?  What do you say, mother?"\r\n\r\nJane Wilson thought a moment.\r\n\r\n"Will and Margaret are married?" asked she.\r\n\r\n"Not exactly,--but very near.  The old woman has twice the spirit of\r\nthe young one.  Come, Mary, give a guess?"\r\n\r\nHe covered his little boy\'s eyes with his hands for an instant,\r\nsignificantly, till the baby pushed them down, saying in his\r\nimperfect way--\r\n\r\n"Tan\'t see."\r\n\r\n"There now!  Johnnie can see.  Do you guess, Mary?"\r\n\r\n"They\'ve done something to Margaret to give her back her sight!"\r\nexclaimed she.\r\n\r\n"They have.  She has been couched, and can see as well as ever.  She\r\nand Will are to be married on the twenty-fifth of this month, and\r\nhe\'s bringing her out next voyage; and Job Legh talks of coming\r\ntoo,--not to see you, Mary,--nor you, mother,--nor you, my little\r\nhero" (kissing him), "but to try and pick up a few specimens of\r\nCanadian insects, Will says.  All the compliment is to the earwigs,\r\nyou see, mother!"\r\n\r\n"Dear Job Legh!" said Mary, softly and seriously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of The Project Gutenberg Etext of Mary Barton, by Elizabeth Gaskell\r\n\r\n'
