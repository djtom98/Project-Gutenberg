But the reason, or caprice, which dictated his change of\r\nsystem, has entirely escaped his recollection, nor is it worth while to\r\nattempt recalling what must be a matter of very little consequence.\r\n\r\nThe general plan of the story was, to conjoin two characters in that\r\nbustling and contentious age, who, thrown into situations which gave\r\nthem different views on the subject of the Reformation, should, with the\r\nsame sincerity and purity of intention, dedicate themselves, the one to\r\nthe support of the sinking fabric of the Catholic Church, the other to\r\nthe establishment of the Reformed doctrines. It was supposed that some\r\ninteresting subjects for narrative might be derived from opposing two\r\nsuch enthusiasts to each other in the path of life, and contrasting the\r\nreal worth of both with their passions and prejudices. The localities\r\nof Melrose suited well the scenery of the proposed story; the ruins\r\nthemselves form a splendid theatre for any tragic incident which might\r\nbe brought forward; joined to the vicinity of the fine river, with all\r\nits tributary streams, flowing through a country which has been the\r\nscene of so much fierce fighting, and is rich with so many recollections\r\nof former times, and lying almost under the immediate eye of the author,\r\nby whom they were to be used in composition.\r\n\r\nThe situation possessed farther recommendations. On the opposite bank of\r\nthe Tweed might be seen the remains of ancient enclosures, surrounded by\r\nsycamores and ash-trees of considerable size. These had once formed the\r\ncrofts or arable ground of a village, now reduced to a single hut, the\r\nabode of a fisherman, who also manages a ferry. The cottages, even the\r\nchurch which once existed there, have sunk into vestiges hardly to\r\nbe traced without visiting the spot, the inhabitants having gradually\r\nwithdrawn to the more prosperous town of Galashiels, which has\r\nrisen into consideration, within two miles of their neighbourhood.\r\nSuperstitious eld, however, has tenanted the deserted groves with aerial\r\nbeings, to supply the want of the mortal tenants who have deserted it.\r\nThe ruined and abandoned churchyard of Boldside has been long believed\r\nto be haunted by the Fairies, and the deep broad current of the Tweed,\r\nwheeling in moonlight round the foot of the steep bank, with the\r\nnumber of trees originally planted for shelter round the fields of\r\nthe cottagers, but now presenting the effect of scattered and detached\r\ngroves, fill up the idea which one would form in imagination for a scene\r\nthat Oberon and Queen Mab might love to revel in. There are evenings\r\nwhen the spectator might believe, with Father Chaucer, that the\r\n\r\n  --Queen of Faery,\r\n  With harp, and pipe, and symphony,\r\n  Were dwelling in the place.\r\n\r\nAnother, and even a more familiar refuge of the elfin race, (if\r\ntradition is to be trusted,) is the glen of the river, or rather brook,\r\nnamed the Allen, which falls into the Tweed from the northward, about a\r\nquarter of a mile above the present bridge. As the streamlet finds its\r\nway behind Lord Sommerville\'s hunting-seat, called the Pavilion, its\r\nvalley has been popularly termed the Fairy Dean, or rather the Nameless\r\nDean, because of the supposed ill luck attached by the popular faith of\r\nancient times, to any one who might name or allude to the race, whom our\r\nfathers distinguished as the Good Neighbours, and the Highlanders called\r\nDaoine Shie, or Men of Peace; rather by way of compliment, than on\r\naccount of any particular idea of friendship or pacific relation which\r\neither Highlander or Borderer entertained towards the irritable beings\r\nwhom they thus distinguished, or supposed them to bear to humanity.\r\n[Footnote: See Rob Roy, Note, p. 202.]\r\n\r\nIn evidence of the actual operations of the fairy people even at this\r\ntime, little pieces of calcareous matter are found in the glen after a\r\nflood, which either the labours of those tiny artists, or the eddies of\r\nthe brook among the stones, have formed into a fantastic resemblance of\r\ncups, saucers, basins, and the like, in which children who gather them\r\npretend to discern fairy utensils.\r\n\r\nBesides these circumstances of romantic locality, _mea paupera regna_\r\n(as Captain Dalgetty denominates his territory of Drumthwacket) are\r\nbounded by a small but deep lake, from which eyes that yet look on the\r\nlight are said to have seen the waterbull ascend, and shake the hills\r\nwith his roar.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the country around Melrose, if possessing less of romantic\r\nbeauty than some other scenes in Scotland, is connected with so many\r\nassociations of a fanciful nature, in which the imagination takes\r\ndelight, as might well induce one even less attached to the spot than\r\nthe author, to accommodate, after a general manner, the imaginary scenes\r\nhe was framing to the localities to which he was partial. But it would\r\nbe a misapprehension to suppose, that, because Melrose may in general\r\npass for Kennaquhair, or because it agrees with scenes of the Monastery\r\nin the circumstances of the drawbridge, the milldam, and other points of\r\nresemblance, that therefore an accurate or perfect local similitude\r\nis to be found in all the particulars of the picture. It was not the\r\npurpose of the author to present a landscape copied from nature, but a\r\npiece of composition, in which a real scene, with which he is familiar,\r\nhad afforded him some leading outlines. Thus the resemblance of the\r\nimaginary Glendearg with the real vale of the Allen, is far from being\r\nminute, nor did the author aim at identifying them. This must appear\r\nplain to all who know the actual character of the Glen of Allen, and\r\nhave taken the trouble to read the account of the imaginary Glendearg.\r\nThe stream in the latter case is described as wandering down a romantic\r\nlittle valley, shifting itself, after the fashion of such a brook,\r\nfrom one side to the other, as it can most easily find its passage, and\r\ntouching nothing in its progress that gives token of cultivation. It\r\nrises near a solitary tower, the abode of a supposed church vassal, and\r\nthe scene of several incidents in the Romance.\r\n\r\nThe real Allen, on the contrary, after traversing the romantic ravine\r\ncalled the Nameless Dean, thrown off from side to side alternately, like\r\na billiard ball repelled by the sides of the table on which it has been\r\nplayed, and in that part of its course resembling the stream which pours\r\ndown Glendearg, may be traced upwards into a more open country, where\r\nthe banks retreat farther from each other, and the vale exhibits a\r\ngood deal of dry ground, which has not been neglected by the active\r\ncultivators of the district. It arrives, too, at a sort of termination,\r\nstriking in itself, but totally irreconcilable with the narrative of\r\nthe Romance. Instead of a single peel-house, or border tower of defence,\r\nsuch as Dame Glendinning is supposed to have inhabited, the head of the\r\nAllen, about five miles above its junction with the Tweed, shows three\r\nruins of Border houses, belonging to different proprietors, and each,\r\nfrom the desire of mutual support so natural to troublesome times,\r\nsituated at the extremity of the property of which it is the principal\r\nmessuage. One of these is the ruinous mansion-house of Hillslap,\r\nformerly the property of the Cairncrosses, and now of Mr. Innes of Stow;\r\na second the tower of Colmslie, an ancient inheritance of the Borthwick\r\nfamily, as is testified by their crest, the Goat\'s Head, which exists on\r\nthe ruin; [Footnote: It appears that Sir Walter Scott\'s memory was not\r\nquite accurate on these points. John Borthwick, Esq. in a note to the\r\npublisher, (June 11, 1813.) says that _Colmslie_ belonged to Mr. Innes\r\nof Stow, while _Hillslap_ forms part of the estate of Crookston. He\r\nadds--"In proof that the tower of Hillslap, which I have taken measures\r\nto preserve from injury, was chiefly in his head, as the tower of\r\n_Glendearg,_ when writing the Monastery, I may mention that, on one of\r\nthe occasions when I had the honour of being a visiter at Abbotsford,\r\nthe stables then being full, I sent a pony to be put up at our tenant\'s\r\nat Hillslap:--\'Well.\' said Sir Walter, \'if you do that, you must trust\r\nfor its not being _lifted_ before to-morrow, to the protection of\r\nHalbert Glendinning: against Christie of the Clintshill.\' At page 58,\r\nvol. iii., the first edition, the \'_winding_ stair\' which the monk\r\nascended is described. The winding stone stair is still to be seen in\r\nHillslap, but not in either of the other two towers" It is however,\r\nprobable, from the Goat\'s-Head crest on Colmslie, that that tower also\r\nhad been of old a possession of the Borthwicks.] a third, the house of\r\nLangshaw, also ruinous, but near which the proprietor, Mr. Baillie of\r\nJerviswood and Mellerstain, has built a small shooting box.\r\n\r\nAll these ruins, so strangely huddled together in a very solitary spot,\r\nhave recollections and traditions of their own, but none of them bear\r\nthe most distant resemblance to the descriptions in the Romance of\r\nthe Monastery; and as the author could hardly have erred so grossly\r\nregarding a spot within a morning\'s ride of his own house, the inference\r\nis, that no resemblance was intended. Hillslap is remembered by the\r\nhumours of the last inhabitants, two or three elderly ladies, of the\r\nclass of Miss Raynalds, in the Old Manor House, though less important by\r\nbirth and fortune. Colmslie is commemorated in song:--\r\n\r\n  Colmslie stands on Colmslie hill.\r\n  The water it flows round Colmslie mill;\r\n  The mill and the kiln gang bonnily.\r\n  And it\'s up with the whippers of Colmslie.\r\n\r\nLangshaw, although larger than the other mansions assembled at the head\r\nof the supposed Glendearg, has nothing about it more remarkable than the\r\ninscription of the present proprietor over his shooting lodge--_Utinam\r\nhane eliam viris impleam amicis_--a modest wish, which I know no one\r\nmore capable of attaining upon an extended scale, than the gentleman who\r\nhas expressed it upon a limited one.\r\n\r\nHaving thus shown that I could say something of these desolated towers,\r\nwhich the desire of social intercourse, or the facility of mutual\r\ndefence, had drawn together at the head of this Glen, I need not add any\r\nfarther reason to show, that there is no resemblance between them\r\nand the solitary habitation of Dame Elspeth Glendinning. Beyond these\r\ndwellings are some remains of natural wood, and a considerable portion\r\nof morass and bog; but I would not advise any who may be curious in\r\nlocalities, to spend time in looking for the fountain and holly-tree of\r\nthe White Lady.\r\n\r\nWhile I am on the subject I may add, that Captain Clutterbuck, the\r\nimaginary editor of the Monastery, has no real prototype in the village\r\nof Melrose or neighbourhood, that ever I saw or heard of. To give some\r\nindividuality to this personage, he is described as a character which\r\nsometimes occurs in actual society--a person who, having spent his life\r\nwithin the necessary duties of a technical profession, from which he\r\nhas been at length emancipated, finds himself without any occupation\r\nwhatever, and is apt to become the prey of ennui, until he discerns some\r\npetty subject of investigation commensurate to his talents, the study of\r\nwhich gives him employment in solitude; while the conscious possession\r\nof information peculiar to himself, adds to his consequence in society.\r\nI have often observed, that the lighter and trivial branches of\r\nantiquarian study are singularly useful in relieving vacuity of such a\r\nkind, and have known them serve many a Captain Clutterbuck to\r\nretreat upon; I was therefore a good deal surprised, when I found the\r\nantiquarian Captain identified with a neighbour and friend of my own,\r\nwho could never have been confounded with him by any one who had read\r\nthe book, and seen the party alluded to. This erroneous identification\r\noccurs in a work entitled, "Illustrations of the Author of Waverley,\r\nbeing Notices and Anecdotes of real Characters, Scenes, and Incidents,\r\nsupposed to be described in his works, by Robert Chambers." This work\r\nwas, of course, liable to many errors, as any one of the kind must be,\r\nwhatever may be the ingenuity of the author, which takes the task of\r\nexplaining what can be only known to another person. Mistakes of place\r\nor inanimate things referred to, are of very little moment; but the\r\ningenious author ought to have been more cautious of attaching real\r\nnames to fictitious characters. I think it is in the Spectator we\r\nread of a rustic wag, who, in a copy of "The Whole Duty of Man," wrote\r\nopposite to every vice the name of some individual in the neighbourhood,\r\nand thus converted that excellent work into a libel on a whole parish.\r\n\r\nThe scenery being thus ready at the author\'s hand, the reminiscences of\r\nthe country were equally favourable. In a land where the horses remained\r\nalmost constantly saddled, and the sword seldom quitted the warrior\'s\r\nside--where war was the natural and constant state of the inhabitants,\r\nand peace only existed in the shape of brief and feverish truces--there\r\ncould be no want of the means to complicate and extricate the incidents\r\nof his narrative at pleasure. There was a disadvantage, notwithstanding,\r\nin treading this Border district, for it had been already ransacked by\r\nthe author himself, as well as others; and unless presented under a\r\nnew light, was likely to afford ground to the objection of _Crambe bis\r\ncocta_.\r\n\r\nTo attain the indispensable quality of novelty, something, it was\r\nthought, might be gained by contrasting the character of the vassals of\r\nthe church with those of the dependants of the lay barons, by whom they\r\nwere surrounded. But much advantage could not be derived from this.\r\nThere were, indeed, differences betwixt the two classes, but, like\r\ntribes in the mineral and vegetable world, which, resembling each other\r\nto common eyes, can be sufficiently well discriminated by naturalists,\r\nthey were yet too similar, upon the whole, to be placed in marked\r\ncontrast with each other.\r\n\r\nMachinery remained--the introduction of the supernatural and marvellous;\r\nthe resort of distressed authors since the days of Horace, but whose\r\nprivileges as a sanctuary have been disputed in the present age, and\r\nwell-nigh exploded. The popular belief no longer allows the possibility\r\nof existence to the race of mysterious beings which hovered betwixt\r\nthis world and that which is invisible. The fairies have abandoned\r\ntheir moonlight turf; the witch no longer holds her black orgies in the\r\nhemlock dell; and\r\n\r\n  Even the last lingering phantom of the brain,\r\n  The churchyard ghost, is now at rest again.\r\n\r\nFrom the discredit attached to the vulgar and more common modes in which\r\nthe Scottish superstition displays itself, the author was induced to\r\nhave recourse to the beautiful, though almost forgotten, theory of\r\nastral spirits, or creatures of the elements, surpassing human beings\r\nin knowledge and power, but inferior to them, as being subject, after\r\na certain space of years, to a death which is to them annihilation,\r\nas they have no share in the promise made to the sons of Adam. These\r\nspirits are supposed to be of four distinct kinds, as the elements from\r\nwhich they have their origin, and are known, to those who have\r\nstudied the cabalistical philosophy, by the names of Sylphs, Gnomes,\r\nSalamanders, and Naiads, as they belong to the elements of Air, Earth,\r\nFire, or Water. The general reader will find an entertaining account\r\nof these elementary spirits in the French book entitled, "Entretiens de\r\nCompte du Gabalis." The ingenious Compte de la Motte Fouqu? composed,\r\nin German, one of the most successful productions of his fertile\r\nbrain, where a beautiful and even afflicting effect is produced by the\r\nintroduction of a water-nymph, who loses the privilege of immortality by\r\nconsenting to become accessible to human feelings, and uniting her lot\r\nwith that of a mortal, who treats her with ingratitude.\r\n\r\nIn imitation of an example so successful, the White Lady of Avenel was\r\nintroduced into the following sheets. She is represented as connected\r\nwith the family of Avenel by one of those mystic ties, which, in ancient\r\ntimes, were supposed to exist, in certain circumstances, between the\r\ncreatures of the elements and the children of men. Such instances\r\nof mysterious union are recognized in Ireland, in the real Milosian\r\nfamilies, who are possessed of a Banshie; and they are known among the\r\ntraditions of the Highlands, which, in many cases, attached an immortal\r\nbeing or spirit to the service of particular families or tribes. These\r\ndemons, if they are to be called so, announced good or evil fortune to\r\nthe families connected with them; and though some only condescended to\r\nmeddle with matters of importance, others, like the May Mollach, or Maid\r\nof the Hairy Arms, condescended to mingle in ordinary sports, and even\r\nto direct the Chief how to play at draughts.\r\n\r\nThere was, therefore, no great violence in supposing such a being as\r\nthis to have existed, while the elementary spirits were believed in;\r\nbut it was more difficult to describe or imagine its attributes and\r\nprinciples of action. Shakespeare, the first of authorities in such a\r\ncase, has painted Ariel, that beautiful creature of his fancy, as only\r\napproaching so near to humanity as to know the nature of that sympathy\r\nwhich the creatures of clay felt for each other, as we learn from the\r\nexpression--"Mine would, if I were human." The inferences from this\r\nare singular, but seem capable of regular deduction. A being, however\r\nsuperior to man in length of life--in power over the elements--in\r\ncertain perceptions respecting the present, the past, and the future,\r\nyet still incapable of human passions, of sentiments of moral good and\r\nevil, of meriting future rewards or punishments, belongs rather to\r\nthe class of animals, than of human creatures, and must therefore be\r\npresumed to act more from temporary benevolence or caprice, than from\r\nanything approaching to feeling or reasoning. Such a being\'s superiority\r\nin power can only be compared to that of the elephant or lion, who are\r\ngreater in strength than man, though inferior in the scale of creation.\r\nThe partialities which we suppose such spirits to entertain must be like\r\nthose of the dog; their sudden starts of passion, or the indulgence of a\r\nfrolic, or mischief, may be compared to those of the numerous varieties\r\nof the cat. All these propensities are, however, controlled by the\r\nlaws which render the elementary race subordinate to the command of\r\nman--liable to be subjected by his science, (so the sect of Gnostics\r\nbelieved, and on this turned the Rosicrucian philosophy,) or to be\r\noverpowered by his superior courage and daring, when it set their\r\nillusions at defiance.\r\n\r\nIt is with reference to this idea of the supposed spirits of the\r\nelements, that the White Lady of Avenel is represented as acting a\r\nvarying, capricious, and inconsistent part in the pages assigned to her\r\nin the narrative; manifesting interest and attachment to the family with\r\nwhom her destinies are associated, but evincing whim, and even a species\r\nof malevolence, towards other mortals, as the Sacristan, and the\r\nBorder robber, whose incorrect life subjected them to receive petty\r\nmortifications at her hand. The White Lady is scarcely supposed,\r\nhowever, to have possessed either the power or the inclination to do\r\nmore than inflict terror or create embarrassment, and is also subjected\r\nby those mortals, who, by virtuous resolution, and mental energy,\r\ncould assert superiority over her. In these particulars she seems to\r\nconstitute a being of a middle class, between the _esprit follet_\r\nwho places its pleasure in misleading and tormenting mortals, and the\r\nbenevolent Fairy of the East, who uniformly guides, aids, and supports\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nEither, however, the author executed his purpose indifferently, or the\r\npublic did not approve of it; for the White Lady of Avenel was far from\r\nbeing popular. He does not now make the present statement, in the view\r\nof arguing readers into a more favourable opinion on the subject, but\r\nmerely with the purpose of exculpating himself from the charge of having\r\nwantonly intruded into the narrative a being of inconsistent powers and\r\npropensities.\r\n\r\nIn the delineation of another character, the author of the Monastery\r\nfailed, where he hoped for some success. As nothing is so successful a\r\nsubject for ridicule as the fashionable follies of the time, it occurred\r\nto him that the more serious scenes of his narrative might be relieved\r\nby the humour of a cavaliero of the age of Queen Elizabeth. In every\r\nperiod, the attempt to gain and maintain the highest rank of society,\r\nhas depended on the power of assuming and supporting a certain\r\nfashionable kind of affectation, usually connected with some vivacity of\r\ntalent and energy of character, but distinguished at the same time by\r\na transcendent flight, beyond sound reason and common sense; both\r\nfaculties too vulgar to be admitted into the estimate of one who claims\r\nto be esteemed "a choice spirit of the age." These, in their different\r\nphases, constitute the gallants of the day, whose boast it is to drive\r\nthe whims of fashion to extremity.\r\n\r\nOn all occasions, the manners of the sovereign, the court, and the time,\r\nmust give the tone to the peculiar description of qualities by which\r\nthose who would attain the height of fashion must seek to distinguish\r\nthemselves. The reign of Elizabeth, being that of a maiden queen,\r\nwas distinguished by the decorum of the courtiers, and especially\r\nthe affectation of the deepest deference to the sovereign. After the\r\nacknowledgment of the Queen\'s matchless perfections, the same devotion\r\nwas extended to beauty as it existed among the lesser stars in her\r\ncourt, who sparkled, as it was the mode to say, by her reflected lustre.\r\nIt is true, that gallant knights no longer vowed to Heaven, the peacock,\r\nand the ladies, to perform some feat of extravagant chivalry, in which\r\nthey endangered the lives of others as well as their own; but although\r\ntheir chivalrous displays of personal gallantry seldom went farther in\r\nElizabeth\'s days than the tilt-yard, where barricades, called barriers,\r\nprevented the shock of the horses, and limited the display of the\r\ncavalier\'s skill to the comparatively safe encounter of their lances,\r\nthe language of the lovers to their ladies was still in the exalted\r\nterms which Amadis would have addressed to Oriana, before encountering a\r\ndragon for her sake. This tone of romantic gallantry found a clever but\r\nconceited author, to reduce it to a species of constitution and form,\r\nand lay down the courtly manner of conversation, in a pedantic book,\r\ncalled Euphues and his England. Of this, a brief account is given in the\r\ntext, to which it may now be proper to make some additions.\r\n\r\nThe extravagance of Euphuism, or a symbolical jargon of the same class,\r\npredominates in the romances of Calprenade and Scuderi, which were read\r\nfor the amusement of the fair sex of France during the long reign of\r\nLouis XIV., and were supposed to contain the only legitimate language of\r\nlove and gallantry. In this reign they encountered the satire of Moliere\r\nand Boileau. A similar disorder, spreading into private society, formed\r\nthe ground of the affected dialogue of the _Praecieuses_, as they were\r\nstyled, who formed the coterie of the Hotel de Rambouillet, and afforded\r\nMoliere matter for his admirable comedy, _Les Praecieuses Ridicules_. In\r\nEngland, the humour does not seem to have long survived the accession of\r\nJames I.\r\n\r\nThe author had the vanity to think that a character, whose peculiarities\r\nshould turn on extravagances which were once universally fashionable,\r\nmight be read in a fictitious story with a good chance of affording\r\namusement to the existing generation, who, fond as they are of looking\r\nback on the actions and manners of their ancestors, might be also\r\nsupposed to be sensible of their absurdities. He must fairly acknowledge\r\nthat he was disappointed, and that the Euphuist, far from being\r\naccounted a well drawn and humorous character of the period, was\r\ncondemned as unnatural and absurd. It would be easy to account for this\r\nfailure, by supposing the defect to arise from the author\'s want of\r\nskill, and, probably, many readers may not be inclined to look farther.\r\nBut as the author himself can scarcely be supposed willing to acquiesce\r\nin this final cause, if any other can be alleged, he has been led to\r\nsuspect, that, contrary to what he originally supposed, his subject was\r\ninjudiciously chosen, in which, and not in his mode of treating it, lay\r\nthe source of the want of success.\r\n\r\nThe manners of a rude people are always founded on nature, and therefore\r\nthe feelings of a more polished generation immediately sympathize with\r\nthem. We need no numerous notes, no antiquarian dissertations, to\r\nenable the most ignorant to recognize the sentiments and diction of\r\nthe characters of Homer; we have but, as Lear says, to strip off our\r\nlendings--to set aside the factitious principles and adornments which we\r\nhave received from our comparatively artificial system of society, and\r\nour natural feelings are in unison with those of the bard of Chios and\r\nthe heroes who live in his verses. It is the same with a great part of\r\nthe narratives of my friend Mr. Cooper. We sympathize with his Indian\r\nchiefs and back-woodsmen, and acknowledge, in the characters which he\r\npresents to us, the same truth of human nature by which we should feel\r\nourselves influenced if placed in the same condition. So much is this\r\nthe case, that, though it is difficult, or almost impossible, to reclaim\r\na savage, bred from his youth to war and the chase, to the restraints\r\nand the duties of civilized life, nothing is more easy or common than\r\nto find men who have been educated in all the habits and comforts of\r\nimproved society, willing to exchange them for the wild labours of the\r\nhunter and the fisher. The very amusements most pursued and relished\r\nby men of all ranks, whose constitutions permit active exercise, are\r\nhunting, fishing, and, in some instances, war, the natural and necessary\r\nbusiness of the savage of Dryden, where his hero talks of being\r\n\r\n  --"As free as nature first made man,\r\n  When wild in woods the noble savage ran."\r\n\r\nBut although the occupations, and even the sentiments, of human beings\r\nin a primitive state, find access and interest in the minds of the more\r\ncivilized part of the species, it does not therefore follow, that the\r\nnational tastes, opinions, and follies of one civilized period, should\r\nafford either the same interest or the same amusement to those of\r\nanother. These generally, when driven to extravagance, are founded, not\r\nupon any natural taste proper to the species, but upon the growth of\r\nsome peculiar cast of affectation, with which mankind in general,\r\nand succeeding generations in particular, feel no common interest or\r\nsympathy. The extravagances of coxcombry in manners and apparel are\r\nindeed the legitimate and often the successful objects of satire, during\r\nthe time when they exist. In evidence of this, theatrical critics\r\nmay observe how many dramatic _jeux d\'esprit_ are well received every\r\nseason, because the satirist levels at some well-known or fashionable\r\nabsurdity; or, in the dramatic phrase, "shoots folly as it flies." But\r\nwhen the peculiar kind of folly keeps the wing no longer, it is reckoned\r\nbut waste of powder to pour a discharge of ridicule on what has ceased\r\nto exist; and the pieces in which such forgotten absurdities are made\r\nthe subject of ridicule, fall quietly into oblivion with the follies\r\nwhich gave them fashion, or only continue to exist on the scene, because\r\nthey contain some other more permanent interest than that which connects\r\nthem with manners and follies of a temporary character.\r\n\r\nThis, perhaps, affords a reason why the comedies of Ben Jonson, founded\r\nupon system, or what the age termed humours,--by which was meant\r\nfactitious and affected characters, superinduced on that which was\r\ncommon to the rest of their race,--in spite of acute satire, deep\r\nscholarship, and strong sense, do not now afford general pleasure, but\r\nare confined to the closet of the antiquary, whose studies have assured\r\nhim that the personages of the dramatist were once, though they are now\r\nno longer, portraits of existing nature.\r\n\r\nLet us take another example of our hypothesis from Shakspeare himself,\r\nwho, of all authors, drew his portraits for all ages. With the whole\r\nsum of the idolatry which affects us at his name, the mass of readers\r\nperuse, without amusement, the characters formed on the extravagances of\r\ntemporary fashion; and the Euphuist Don Armado, the pedant Holofernes,\r\neven Nym and Pistol, are read with little pleasure by the mass of the\r\npublic, being portraits of which we cannot recognize the humour, because\r\nthe originals no longer exist. In like manner, while the distresses of\r\nRomeo and Juliet continue to interest every bosom, Mercutio, drawn as\r\nan accurate representation of the finished fine gentleman of the period,\r\nand as such received by the unanimous approbation of contemporaries, has\r\nso little to interest the present age, that, stripped of all his puns,\r\nand quirks of verbal wit, he only retains his place in the scene, in\r\nvirtue of his fine and fanciful speech upon dreaming, which belongs\r\nto no particular age, and because he is a personage whose presence is\r\nindispensable to the plot.\r\n\r\nWe have already prosecuted perhaps too far an argument, the tendency of\r\nwhich is to prove, that the introduction of an humorist, acting like Sir\r\nPiercie Shafton, upon some forgotten and obsolete model of folly, once\r\nfashionable, is rather likely to awaken the disgust of the reader,\r\nas unnatural, than find him food for laughter. Whether owing to this\r\ntheory, or whether to the more simple and probable cause of the author\'s\r\nfailure in the delineation of the subject he had proposed to himself,\r\nthe formidable objection of _incredulus odi_ was applied to the\r\nEuphuist, as well as to the White Lady of Avenel; and the one was\r\ndenounced as unnatural, while the other was rejected as impossible.\r\n\r\nThere was little in the story to atone for these failures in two\r\nprincipal points. The incidents were inartificially huddled together.\r\nThere was no part of the intrigue to which deep interest was found to\r\napply; and the conclusion was brought about, not by incidents arising\r\nout of the story itself, but in consequence of public transactions,\r\nwith which the narrative has little connexion, and which the reader had\r\nlittle opportunity to become acquainted with.\r\n\r\nThis, if not a positive fault, was yet a great defect in the Romance.\r\nIt is true, that not only the practice of some great authors in this\r\ndepartment, but even the general course of human life itself, may be\r\nquoted in favour of this more obvious and less artificial practice of\r\narranging a narrative. It is seldom that the same circle of personages\r\nwho have surrounded an individual at his first outset in life, continue\r\nto have an interest in his career till his fate comes to a crisis. On\r\nthe contrary, and more especially if the events of his life be of a\r\nvaried character, and worth communicating to others, or to the world,\r\nthe hero\'s later connexions are usually totally separated from those\r\nwith whom he began the voyage, but whom the individual has outsailed,\r\nor who have drifted astray, or foundered on the passage. This hackneyed\r\ncomparison holds good in another point. The numerous vessels of so many\r\ndifferent sorts, and destined for such different purposes, which are\r\nlaunched in the same mighty ocean, although each endeavours to pursue\r\nits own course, are in every case more influenced by the winds and\r\ntides, which are common to the element which they all navigate, than by\r\ntheir own separate exertions. And it is thus in the world, that, when\r\nhuman prudence has done its best, some general, perhaps national, event,\r\ndestroys the schemes of the individual, as the casual touch of a more\r\npowerful being sweeps away the web of the spider.\r\n\r\nMany excellent romances have been composed in this view of human life,\r\nwhere the hero is conducted through a variety of detached scenes, in\r\nwhich various agents appear and disappear, without, perhaps, having any\r\npermanent influence on the progress of the story. Such is the structure\r\nof Gil Blas, Roderick Random, and the lives and adventures of many other\r\nheroes, who are described as running through different stations of life,\r\nand encountering various adventures, which are only connected with each\r\nother by having happened to be witnessed by the same individual, whose\r\nidentity unites them together, as the string of a necklace links the\r\nbeads, which are otherwise detached.\r\n\r\nBut though such an unconnected course of adventures is what most\r\nfrequently occurs in nature, yet the province of the romance writer\r\nbeing artificial, there is more required from him than a mere compliance\r\nwith the simplicity of reality,--just as we demand from the scientific\r\ngardener, that he shall arrange, in curious knots and artificial\r\nparterres, the flowers which "nature boon" distributes freely on hill\r\nand dale. Fielding, accordingly, in most of his novels, but especially\r\nin Tom Jones, his _chef-d\'oeuvre_, has set the distinguished example\r\nof a story regularly built and consistent in all its parts, in which\r\nnothing occurs, and scarce a personage is introduced, that has not some\r\nshare in tending to advance the catastrophe.\r\n\r\nTo demand equal correctness and felicity in those who may follow in\r\nthe track of that illustrious novelist, would be to fetter too much the\r\npower of giving pleasure, by surrounding it with penal rules; since of\r\nthis sort of light literature it may be especially said--_tout genre est\r\npermis, hors le genre ennuyeux_. Still, however, the more closely and\r\nhappily the story is combined, and the more natural and felicitous the\r\ncatastrophe, the nearer such a composition will approach the perfection\r\nof the novelist\'s art; nor can an author neglect this branch of his\r\nprofession, without incurring proportional censure.\r\n\r\nFor such censure the Monastery gave but too much occasion. The intrigue\r\nof the Romance, neither very interesting in itself, nor very happily\r\ndetailed, is at length finally disentangled by the breaking out of\r\nnational hostilities between England and Scotland, and the as sudden\r\nrenewal of the truce. Instances of this kind, it is true, cannot in\r\nreality have been uncommon, but the resorting to such, in order to\r\naccomplish the catastrophe, as by a _tour de force_, was objected to as\r\ninartificial, and not perfectly, intelligible to the general reader.\r\n\r\nStill the Monastery, though exposed to severe and just criticism, did\r\nnot fail, judging from the extent of its circulation, to have some\r\ninterest for the public. And this, too, was according to the ordinary\r\ncourse of such matters; for it very seldom happens that literary\r\nreputation is gained by a single effort, and still more rarely is it\r\nlost by a solitary miscarriage.\r\n\r\nThe author, therefore, had his days of grace allowed him, and time, if\r\nhe pleased, to comfort himself with the burden of the old Scots song,\r\n\r\n  "If it isna weel bobbit.\r\n  We\'ll bob it again."\r\n\r\nABBOTSFORD, _1st November_, 1830.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY EPISTLE\r\n\r\nFROM CAPTAIN CLUTTERBUCK, LATE OF HIS MAJESTY\'S ---- REGIMENT OF\r\nINFANTRY, TO THE AUTHOR OF WAVERLEY.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nAlthough I do not pretend to the pleasure of your personal acquaintance,\r\nlike many whom I believe to be equally strangers to you, I am\r\nnevertheless interested in your publications, and desire their\r\ncontinuance;-not that I pretend to much taste in fictitious composition,\r\nor that I am apt to be interested in your grave scenes, or amused by\r\nthose which are meant to be lively. I will not disguise from you, that I\r\nhave yawned over the last interview of MacIvor and his sister, and fell\r\nfairly asleep while the schoolmaster was reading the humours of Dandie\r\nDinmont. You see, sir, that I scorn to solicit your favour in a way\r\nto which you are no stranger. If the papers I enclose you are worth\r\nnothing, I will not endeavour to recommend them by personal flattery, as\r\na bad cook pours rancid butter upon stale fish. No, sir! what I\r\nrespect in you is the light you have occasionally thrown on national\r\nantiquities, a study which I have commenced rather late in life, but to\r\nwhich I am attached with the devotions of a first love, because it is\r\nthe only study I ever cared a farthing for.\r\n\r\nYou shall have my history, sir, (it will not reach to three volumes,)\r\nbefore that of my manuscript; and as you usually throw out a few lines\r\nof verse (by way of skirmishers, I suppose) at the head of each\r\ndivision of prose, I have had the luck to light upon a stanza in the\r\nschoolmaster\'s copy of Burns which describes me exactly. I love it\r\nthe better, because it was originally designed for Captain Grose, an\r\nexcellent antiquary, though, like yourself, somewhat too apt to treat\r\nwith levity his own pursuits:\r\n\r\n  \'Tis said he was a soldier bred,\r\n  And ane wad rather fa\'en than fled;\r\n  But now he\'s quit the spurtle blade,\r\n                   And dog-skin wallet,\r\n  And ta\'en the--antiquarian trade,\r\n                I think, they call it.\r\n\r\nI never could conceive what influenced me, when a boy, in the choice of\r\na profession. Military zeal and ardour it was not, which made me stand\r\nout for a commission in the Scots Fusiliers, when my tutors and curators\r\nwished to bind me apprentice to old David Stiles, Clerk to his Majesty\'s\r\nSignet. I say, military zeal it was _not_; for I was no fighting boy in\r\nmy own person, and cared not a penny to read the history of the heroes\r\nwho turned the world upside down in former ages. As for courage, I had,\r\nas I have since discovered, just as much of it as serve\'d my turn, and\r\nnot one frain of surplus. I soon found out, indeed, that in action there\r\nwas more anger in running away than in standing fast; and besides, I\r\ncould not afford to lose my commission, which was my chief means of\r\nsupport. But, as for that overboiling valour, which I have heard many of\r\n_ours_ talk of, though I seldom observed that it influenced them in\r\nthe actual affair---that exuberant zeal, which courts Danger as a\r\nbride,--truly my courage was of a complexion much less ecstatical.\r\n\r\nAgain, the love of a red coat, which, in default of all other aptitudes\r\nto the profession, has made many a bad soldier and some good ones,\r\nwas an utter stranger to my disposition. I cared not a "bodle" for the\r\ncompany of the misses: Nay, though there was a boarding-school in the\r\nvillage, and though we used to meet with its fair inmates at Simon\r\nLightfoot\'s weekly Practising, I cannot recollect any strong emotions\r\nbeing excited on these occasions, excepting the infinite regret with\r\nwhich I went through the polite ceremonial of presenting my partner with\r\nan orange, thrust into my pocket by my aunt for this special purpose,\r\nbut which, had I dared, I certainly would have secreted for my own\r\npersonal use. As for vanity, or love of finery for itself, I was such a\r\nstranger to it, that the difficulty was great to make me brush my coat,\r\nand appear in proper trim upon parade. I shall never forget the rebuke\r\nof my old Colonel on a morning when the King reviewed a brigade of which\r\nours made part. "I am no friend to extravagance, Ensign Clutterbuck,"\r\nsaid he; "but, on the day when we are to pass before the Sovereign of\r\nthe kingdom, in the name of God I would have at least shown him an inch\r\nof clean linen."\r\n\r\nThus, a stranger to the ordinary motives which lead young men to make\r\nthe army their choice, and without the least desire to become either a\r\nhero or a dandy, I really do not know what determined my thoughts that\r\nway, unless it were the happy state of half-pay indolence enjoyed\r\nby Captain Doolittle, who had set up his staff of rest in my native\r\nvillage. Every other person had, or seemed to have, something to do,\r\nless or more. They did not, indeed, precisely go to school and learn\r\ntasks, that last of evils in my estimation; but it did not escape my\r\nboyish observation, that they were all bothered with something or other\r\nlike duty or labour--all but the happy Captain Doolittle. The minister\r\nhad his parish to visit, and his preaching to prepare, though perhaps he\r\nmade more fuss than he needed about both. The laird had his farming\r\nand improving operations to superintend; and, besides, he had to\r\nattend trustee meetings, and lieutenancy meetings, and head-courts, and\r\nmeetings of justices, and what not--was as early up, (that I detested,)\r\nand as much in the open air, wet and dry, as his own grieve. The\r\nshopkeeper (the village boasted but one of eminence) stood indeed pretty\r\nmuch at his ease behind his counter, for his custom was by no means\r\noverburdensome; but still he enjoyed his _status_, as the Bailie calls\r\nit, upon condition of tumbling all the wares in his booth over and over,\r\nwhen any one chose to want a yard of muslin, a mousetrap, an ounce of\r\ncaraways, a paper of pins, the Sermons of Mr. Peden, or the Life of\r\nJack the Giant-Queller, (not Killer, as usually erroneously written and\r\npronounced.--See my essay on the true history of this worthy, where real\r\nfacts have in a peculiar degree been obscured by fable.) In short, all\r\nin the village were under the necessity of doing something which they\r\nwould rather have left undone, excepting Captain Doolittle, who walked\r\nevery morning in the open street, which formed the high mall of our\r\nvillage, in a blue coat with a red neck, and played at whist the whole\r\nevening, when he could make up a party. This happy vacuity of all\r\nemployment appeared to me so delicious, that it became the primary\r\nhint, which, according to the system of Helvetius, as the minister says,\r\ndetermined my infant talents towards the profession I was destined to\r\nillustrate.\r\n\r\nBut who, alas! can form a just estimate of their future prospects in\r\nthis deceitful world? I was not long engaged in my new profession,\r\nbefore I discovered, that if the independent indolence of half-pay was\r\na paradise, the officer must pass through the purgatory of duty and\r\nservice in order to gain admission to it. Captain Doolittle might brush\r\nhis blue coat with the red neck, or leave it unbrushed, at his pleasure;\r\nbut Ensign Clutterbuck had no such option. Captain Doolittle might go\r\nto bed at ten o\'clock, if he had a mind; but the Ensign must make the\r\nrounds in his turn. What was worse, the Captain might repose under the\r\ntester of his tent-bed until noon, if he was so pleased; but the Ensign,\r\nGod help him, had to appear upon parade at peep of day. As for duty,\r\nI made that as easy as I could, had the sergeant to whisper to me the\r\nwords of command, and bustled through as other folks did. Of service, I\r\nsaw enough for an indolent man--was buffeted up and down the world, and\r\nvisited both the East and West Indies, Egypt, and other distant places,\r\nwhich my youth had scarce dreamed of. The French I saw, and felt too;\r\nwitness two fingers on my right hand, which one of their cursed hussars\r\ntook off with his sabre as neatly as an hospital surgeon. At length, the\r\ndeath of an old aunt, who left me some fifteen hundred pounds, snugly\r\nvested in the three per cents, gave me the long-wished-for opportunity\r\nof retiring, with the prospect of enjoying a clean shirt and a guinea\r\nfour times a-week at least.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of commencing my new way of life, I selected for\r\nmy residence the village of Kennaquhair, in the south of Scotland,\r\ncelebrated for the ruins of its magnificent Monastery, intending there\r\nto lead my future life in the _otium cum dignitate_ of half-pay and\r\nannuity. I was not long, however, in making the grand discovery, that in\r\norder to enjoy leisure, it is absolutely necessary it should be preceded\r\nby occupation. For some time, it was delightful to wake at daybreak,\r\ndreaming of the reveill?--then to recollect my happy emancipation from\r\nthe slavery that doomed me to start at a piece of clattering parchment,\r\nturn on my other side, damn the parade, and go to sleep again. But even\r\nthis enjoyment had its termination; and time, when it became a stock\r\nentirely at my own disposal, began to hang heavy on my hand.\r\n\r\nI angled for two days, during which time I lost twenty hooks, and\r\nseveral scores of yards of gut and line, and caught not even a minnow.\r\nHunting was out of the question, for the stomach of a horse by no means\r\nagrees with the half-pay establishment. When I shot, the shepherds, and\r\nploughmen, and my very dog, quizzed me every time that I missed, which\r\nwas, generally speaking, every time I fired. Besides, the country\r\ngentlemen in this quarter like their game, and began to talk of\r\nprosecutions and interdicts. I did not give up fighting the French to\r\ncommence a domestic war with the "pleasant men of Teviotdale," as the\r\nsong calls them; so I e\'en spent three days (very agreeably) in cleaning\r\nmy gun, and disposing it upon two hooks over my chimney-piece.\r\n\r\nThe success of this accidental experiment set me on trying my skill in\r\nthe mechanical arts. Accordingly I took down and cleaned my landlady\'s\r\ncuckoo-clock, and in so doing, silenced that companion of the spring for\r\never and a day. I mounted a turning-lathe, and in attempting to use\r\nit, I very nearly cribbed off, with an inch-and-half former, one of the\r\nfingers which the hussar had left me.\r\n\r\nBooks I tried, both those of the little circulating library, and of the\r\nmore rational subscription collection maintained by this intellectual\r\npeople. But neither the light reading of the one, nor the heavy\r\nartillery of the other, suited my purpose. I always fell asleep at\r\nthe fourth or fifth page of history or disquisition; and it took me a\r\nmonth\'s hard reading to wade through a half-bound trashy novel, during\r\nwhich I was pestered with applications to return the volumes, by every\r\nhalf-bred milliner\'s miss about the place. In short, during the time\r\nwhen all the town besides had something to do, I had nothing for it, but\r\nto walk in the church-yard, and whistle till it was dinner-time.\r\n\r\nDuring these promenades, the ruins necessarily forced themselves on my\r\nattention, and, by degrees, I found myself engaged in studying the\r\nmore minute ornaments, and at length the general plan, of this noble\r\nstructure. The old sexton aided my labours, and gave me his portion of\r\ntraditional lore. Every day added something to my stock of knowledge\r\nrespecting the ancient state of the building; and at length I made\r\ndiscoveries concerning the purpose of several detached and very ruinous\r\nportions of it, the use of which had hitherto been either unknown\r\naltogether or erroneously explained.\r\n\r\nThe knowledge which I thus acquired I had frequent opportunities of\r\nretailing to those visiters whom the progress of a Scottish tour brought\r\nto visit this celebrated spot. Without encroaching on the privilege of\r\nmy friend the sexton, I became gradually an assistant Cicerone in the\r\ntask of description and explanation, and often (seeing a fresh party of\r\nvisiters arrive) has he turned over to me those to whom he had told half\r\nhis story, with the flattering observation, "What needs I say ony mair\r\nabout it? There\'s the Captain kens mair anent it than I do, or any\r\nman in the town." Then would I salute the strangers courteously, and\r\nexpatiate to their astonished minds upon crypts and chancels, and naves,\r\narches, Gothic and Saxon architraves, mullions and flying buttresses. It\r\nnot unfrequently happened, that an acquaintance which commenced in the\r\nAbbey concluded in the inn, which served to relieve the solitude as\r\nwell as the monotony of my landlady\'s shoulder of mutton, whether roast,\r\ncold, or hashed.\r\n\r\nBy degrees my mind became enlarged; I found a book or two which\r\nenlightened me on the subject of Gothic architecture, and I read now\r\nwith pleasure, because I was interested in what I read about. Even my\r\ncharacter began to dilate and expand. I spoke with more authority at\r\nthe club, and was listened to with deference, because on one subject, at\r\nleast, I possessed more information than any of its members. Indeed,\r\nI found that even my stories about Egypt, which, to say truth, were\r\nsomewhat threadbare, were now listened to with more respect than\r\nformerly. "The Captain," they said, "had something in him after\r\na\',--there were few folk kend sae muckle about the Abbey."\r\n\r\nWith this general approbation waxed my own sense of self-importance, and\r\nmy feeling of general comfort. I ate with more appetite, I digested with\r\nmore ease, I lay down at night with joy, and slept sound till morning,\r\nwhen I arose with a sense of busy importance, and hied me to measure, to\r\nexamine, and to compare the various parts of this interesting structure.\r\nI lost all sense and consciousness of certain unpleasant sensations of\r\na nondescript nature, about my head and stomach, to which I had been in\r\nthe habit of attending, more for the benefit of the village apothecary\r\nthan my own, for the pure want of something else to think about. I\r\nhad found out an occupation unwittingly, and was happy because I had\r\nsomething to do. In a word, I had commenced local antiquary, and was not\r\nunworthy of the name.\r\n\r\nWhilst I was in this pleasing career of busy idleness, for so it might\r\nat best be called, it happened that I was one night sitting in my little\r\nparlour, adjacent to the closet which my landlady calls my bedroom, in\r\nthe act of preparing for an early retreat to the realms of Morpheus.\r\nDugdale\'s Monasticon, borrowed from the library at A------, was lying\r\non the table before me, flanked by some excellent Cheshire cheese,\r\n(a present, by the way, from an honest London citizen, to whom I had\r\nexplained the difference between a Gothic and a Saxon arch,) and a glass\r\nof Vanderhagen\'s best ale. Thus armed at all points against my old enemy\r\nTime, I was leisurely and deliciously preparing for bed--now reading\r\na line of old Dugdale--now sipping my ale, or munching my bread and\r\ncheese--now undoing the strings at my breeches\' knees, or a button or\r\ntwo of my waistcoat, until the village clock should strike ten, before\r\nwhich time I make it a rule never to go to bed. A loud knocking,\r\nhowever, interrupted my ordinary process on this occasion, and the voice\r\nof my honest landlord of the George was heard vociferating, [Footnote:\r\nThe George was, and is, the principal inn in the village of Kennaquhair,\r\nor Melrose. But the landlord of the period was not the same civil\r\nand quiet person by whom the inn is now kept. David Kyle, a Melrose\r\nproprietor of no little importance, a first-rate person of consequence\r\nin whatever belonged to the business of the town, was the original owner\r\nand landlord of the inn. Poor David, like many other busy men, took so\r\nmuch care of public affairs, as in some degree to neglect his own. There\r\nare persons still alive at Kennaquhair who can recognise him and his\r\npeculiarities in the following sketch of mine Host of the George.]\r\n"What the deevil, Mrs. Grimslees, the Captain is no in his bed? and\r\na gentleman at our house has ordered a fowl and minced collops, and a\r\nbottle of sherry, and has sent to ask him to supper, to tell him all\r\nabout the Abbey."\r\n\r\n"Na," answered Luckie Grimslees, in the true sleepy tone of a Scottish\r\nmatron when ten o\'clock is going to strike, "he\'s no in his bed, but\r\nI\'se warrant him no gae out at this time o\' night to keep folks sitting\r\nup waiting for him--the Captain\'s a decent man."\r\n\r\nI plainly perceived this last compliment was made for my hearing, by way\r\nboth of indicating and of recommending the course of conduct which Mrs.\r\nGrimslees desired I should pursue. But I had not been knocked about\r\nthe world for thirty years and odd, and lived a bluff bachelor all\r\nthe while, to come home and be put under petticoat government by my\r\nlandlady. Accordingly I opened my chamber-door, and desired my old\r\nfriend David to walk up stairs.\r\n\r\n"Captain," said he, as he entered, "I am as glad to find you up as if\r\nI had hooked a twenty pound saumon. There\'s a gentleman up yonder that\r\nwill not sleep sound in his bed this blessed night unless he has the\r\npleasure to drink a glass of wine with you."\r\n\r\n"You know, David," I replied, with becoming dignity, "that I cannot with\r\npropriety go out to visit strangers at this time of night, or accept of\r\ninvitations from people of whom I know nothing."\r\n\r\nDavid swore a round oath, and added, "Was ever the like heard of? He has\r\nordered a fowl and egg sauce, a pancake and minced collops and a bottle\r\nof sherry--D\'ye think I wad come and ask you to go to keep company with\r\nony bit English rider that sups on toasted cheese, and a cheerer of\r\nrum-toddy? This is a gentleman every inch of him, and a virtuoso, a\r\nclean virtuoso-a sad-coloured stand of claithes, and a wig like the\r\ncurled back of a mug-ewe. The very first question he speered was about\r\nthe auld drawbrig that has been at the bottom of the water these\r\ntwal score years--I have seen the fundations when we were sticking\r\nsaumon--And how the deevil suld he ken ony thing about the old drawbrig,\r\nunless he were a virtuoso?" [Footnote: There is more to be said about\r\nthis old bridge hereafter. See Note, p. 57.]\r\n\r\nDavid being a virtuoso in his own way, and moreover a landholder and\r\nheritor, was a qualified judge of all who frequented his house, and\r\ntherefore I could not avoid again tying the strings of my knees.\r\n\r\n"That\'s right, Captain," vociferated David; "you twa will be as thick\r\nas three in a bed an ance ye forgather. I haena seen the like o\' him\r\nmy very sell since I saw the great Doctor Samuel Johnson on his tower\r\nthrough Scotland, whilk tower is lying in my back parlour for the\r\namusement of my guests, wi\' the twa boards torn aff."\r\n\r\n"Then the gentleman is a scholar, David?"\r\n\r\n"I\'se uphaud him a scholar," answered David: "he has a black coat on, or\r\na brown ane, at ony-rate."\r\n\r\n"Is he a clergyman?"\r\n\r\n"I am thinking no, for he looked after his horse\'s supper before he\r\nspoke o\' his ain," replied mine host.\r\n\r\n"Has he a servant?" demanded I.\r\n\r\n"Nae servant," answered David; "but a grand face o\' his ain, that wad\r\ngar ony body be willing to serve him that looks upon him."\r\n\r\n"And what makes him think of disturbing me? Ah, David, this has been\r\nsome of your chattering; you are perpetually bringing your guests on my\r\nshoulders, as if it were my business to entertain every man who comes to\r\nthe George."\r\n\r\n"What the deil wad ye hae me do, Captain?" answered mine host; "a\r\ngentleman lights down, and asks me in a most earnest manner, what man of\r\nsense and learning there is about our town, that can tell him about the\r\nantiquities of the place, and specially about the auld Abbey--ye wadna\r\nhae me tell the gentleman a lee? and ye ken weel eneugh there is naebody\r\nin the town can say a reasonable word about it, be it no yoursell,\r\nexcept the bedral, and he is as fou as a piper by this time. So, says\r\nI, there\'s Captain Clutterbuck, that\'s a very civil gentleman and has\r\nlittle to do forby telling a\' the auld cracks about the Abbey, and\r\ndwells just hard by. Then says the gentleman to me, \'Sir,\' says he,\r\nvery civilly, \'have the goodness to step to Captain Clutterbuck with my\r\ncompliments, and say I am a stranger, who have been led to these parts\r\nchiefly by the fame of these Ruins, and that I would call upon him, but\r\nthe hour is late.\' And mair he said that I have forgotten, but I weel\r\nremember it ended,--\'And, landlord, get a bottle of your best sherry,\r\nand supper for two.\'--Ye wadna have had me refuse to do the gentleman\'s\r\nbidding, and me a publican?"\r\n\r\n"Well, David," said I, "I wish your virtuoso had taken a fitter\r\nhour--but as you say he is a gentleman--"\r\n\r\n"I\'se uphaud him that--the order speaks for itsell--a bottle of\r\nsherry--minched collops and a fowl--that\'s speaking like a gentleman, I\r\ntrow?--That\'s right, Captain, button weel up, the night\'s raw--but the\r\nwater\'s clearing for a\' that; we\'ll be on\'t neist night wi\' my Lord\'s\r\nboats, and we\'ll hae ill luck if I dinna send you a kipper to relish\r\nyour ale at e\'en." [Footnote: The nobleman whose boats are mentioned\r\nin the text, is the late kind and amiable Lord Sommerville, an intimate\r\nfriend of the author. David Kyle was a constant and privileged\r\nattendant when Lord Sommerville had a party for spearing salmon; on such\r\noccasions, eighty or a hundred fish were often killed between Gleamer\r\nand Leaderfoot.]\r\n\r\nIn five minutes after this dialogue, I found myself in the parlour of\r\nthe George, and in the presence of the stranger.\r\n\r\nHe was a grave personage, about my own age, (which we shall call about\r\nfifty,) and really had, as my friend David expressed it, something\r\nin his face that inclined men to oblige and to serve him. Yet this\r\nexpression of authority was not at all of the cast which I have seen\r\nin the countenance of a general of brigade, neither was the stranger\'s\r\ndress at all martial. It consisted of a uniform suit of iron-gray\r\nclothes, cut in rather an old-fashioned form. His legs were defended\r\nwith strong leathern gambadoes, which, according to an antiquarian\r\ncontrivance, opened at the sides, and were secured by steel clasps.\r\nHis countenance was worn as much by toil and sorrow as by age, for it\r\nintimated that he had seen and endured much. His address was singularly\r\npleasing and gentlemanlike, and the apology which he made for disturbing\r\nme at such an hour, and in such a manner, was so well and handsomely\r\nexpressed, that I could not reply otherwise than by declaring my\r\nwillingness to be of service to him.\r\n\r\n"I have been a traveller to-day, sir," said he, "and I would willingly\r\ndefer the little I have to say till after supper, for which I feel\r\nrather more appetized than usual."\r\n\r\nWe sate down to table, and notwithstanding the stranger\'s alleged\r\nappetite, as well as the gentle preparation of cheese and ale which\r\nI had already laid aboard, I really believe that I of the two did the\r\ngreater honour to my friend David\'s fowl and minced collops.\r\n\r\nWhen the cloth was removed, and we had each made a tumbler of negus, of\r\nthat liquor which hosts call Sherry, and guests call Lisbon, I perceived\r\nthat the stranger seemed pensive, silent, and somewhat embarrassed,\r\nas if he had something to communicate which he knew not well how to\r\nintroduce. To pave the way for him, I spoke of the ancient ruins of the\r\nMonastery, and of their history. But, to my great surprise, I found I\r\nhad met my match with a witness. The stranger not only knew all that\r\nI could tell him, but a great deal more; and, what was still more\r\nmortifying, he was able, by reference to dates, charters, and other\r\nevidence of facts, that, as Burns says, "downa be disputed," to\r\ncorrect many of the vague tales which I had adopted on loose and vulgar\r\ntradition, as well as to confute more than one of my favourite theories\r\non the subject of the old monks and their dwellings, which I had sported\r\nfreely in all the presumption of superior information. And here I cannot\r\nbut remark, that much of the stranger\'s arguments and inductions rested\r\nupon the authority of Mr. Deputy Register of Scotland, [Footnote:\r\nThomas Thomson, Esq., whose well-deserved panegyric ought to be found\r\non another page than one written by an intimate friend of thirty\r\nyears\' standing.] and his lucubrations; a gentleman whose indefatigable\r\nresearch into the national records is like to destroy my trade, and that\r\nof all local antiquaries, by substituting truth instead of legend and\r\nromance. Alas! I would the learned gentleman did but know how difficult\r\nit is for us dealers in petty wares of antiquity to--\r\n\r\n  Pluck from our memories a rooted "legend,"\r\n  Raze out the written records of our brain.\r\n  Or cleanse our bosoms of that perilous stuff--\r\n\r\nand so forth. It would, I am sure, move his pity to think how many old\r\ndogs he hath set to learn new tricks, how many venerable parrots he hath\r\ntaught to sing a new song, how many gray heads he hath addled by vain\r\nattempts to exchange their old _Mumpsimus_ for his new _Sumpsimus_.\r\nBut let it pass. _Humana perpessi sumus_--All changes round us, past,\r\npresent, and to come; that which was history yesterday becomes fable\r\nto-day, and the truth of to-day is hatched into a lie by to-morrow.\r\n\r\nFinding myself like to be overpowered in the Monastery, which I had\r\nhitherto regarded as my citadel, I began, like a skilful general, to\r\nevacuate that place of defence, and fight my way through the adjacent\r\ncountry. I had recourse to my acquaintance with the families and\r\nantiquities of the neighbourhood, ground on which I thought I might\r\nskirmish at large without its being possible for the stranger to meet me\r\nwith advantage. But I was mistaken.\r\n\r\nThe man in the iron-gray suit showed a much more minute knowledge of\r\nthese particulars than I had the least pretension to. He could tell the\r\nvery year in which the family of De Haga first settled on their ancient\r\nbarony.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: The family of De Haga, modernized into Haig, of Bemerside, is\r\nof the highest antiquity, and is the subject of one of the prophecies of\r\nThomas the Rhymer:--\r\n\r\n  Betide, betide, whate\'er betide.\r\n  Haig shall be Haig of Bemerside. ]\r\n\r\nNot a Thane within reach but he knew his family and connexions, how many\r\nof his ancestors had fallen by the sword of the English, how many\r\nin domestic brawl, and how many by the hand of the executioner for\r\nmarch-treason. Their castles he was acquainted with from turret to\r\nfoundation-stone; and as for the miscellaneous antiquities scattered\r\nabout the country, he knew every one of them, from a _cromlech_ to a\r\n_cairn_, and could give as good an account of each as if he had lived in\r\nthe time of the Danes or Druids.\r\n\r\nI was now in the mortifying predicament of one who suddenly finds\r\nhimself a scholar when he came to teach, and nothing was left for me but\r\nto pick up as much of his conversation as I could, for the benefit of\r\nthe next company. I told, indeed, Allan Ramsay\'s story of the Monk and\r\nMiller\'s Wife, in order to retreat with some honour under cover of a\r\nparting volley. Here, however, my flank was again turned by the eternal\r\nstranger.\r\n\r\n"You are pleased to be facetious, sir," said he; "but you cannot be\r\nignorant that the ludicrous incident you mentioned is the subject of a\r\ntale much older than that of Allan Ramsay."\r\n\r\nI nodded, unwilling to acknowledge my ignorance, though, in fact, I knew\r\nno more what he meant than did one of my friend David\'s post-horses.\r\n\r\n"I do not allude," continued my omniscient companion, "to the curious\r\npoem published by Pinkerton from the Maitland Manuscript, called the\r\nFryars of Berwick, although it presents a very minute and amusing\r\npicture of Scottish manners during the reign of James V.; but rather\r\nto the Italian novelist, by whom, so far as I know, the story was first\r\nprinted, although unquestionably he first took his original from some\r\nancient _fabliau_." [Footnote: It is curious to remark at how little\r\nexpense of invention successive ages are content to receive amusement.\r\nThe same story which Ramsay and Dunbar have successively handled, forms\r\nalso the subject of the modern farce, No Song, no Supper.]\r\n\r\n"It is not to be doubted," answered I, not very well understanding,\r\nhowever, the proposition to which I gave such unqualified assent.\r\n\r\n"Yet," continued my companion, "I question much, had you known my\r\nsituation and profession, whether you would have pitched upon this\r\nprecise anecdote for my amusement."\r\n\r\nThis observation he made in a tone of perfect good-humour. I pricked\r\nup my ears at the hint, and answered as politely as I could, that my\r\nignorance of his condition and rank could be the only cause of my\r\nhaving stumbled on anything disagreeable; and that I was most willing to\r\napologize for my unintentional offence, so soon as I should know wherein\r\nit consisted.\r\n\r\n"Nay, no offence, sir," he replied; "offence can only exist where it\r\nis taken. I have been too long accustomed to more severe and cruel\r\nmisconstructions, to be offended at a popular jest, though directed at\r\nmy profession."\r\n\r\n"Am I to understand, then," I answered, "that I am speaking with a\r\nCatholic clergyman?"\r\n\r\n"An unworthy monk of the order of Saint Benedict," said the stranger,\r\n"belonging to a community of your own countrymen, long established\r\nin France, and scattered unhappily by the events of the Revolution."\r\n"Then," said I, "you are a native Scotchman, and from this\r\nneighbourhood?"\r\n\r\n"Not so," answered the monk; "I am a Scotchman by extraction only, and\r\nnever was in this neighbourhood during my whole life."\r\n\r\n"Never in this neighbourhood, and yet so minutely acquainted with its\r\nhistory, its traditions, and even its external scenery! You surprise me,\r\nsir," I replied.\r\n\r\n"It is not surprising," he said, "that I should have that sort of local\r\ninformation, when it is considered, that my uncle, an excellent man,\r\nas well as a good Scotchman, the head also of our religious community,\r\nemployed much of his leisure in making me acquainted with these\r\nparticulars; and that I myself, disgusted with what has been passing\r\naround me, have for many years amused myself, by digesting and arranging\r\nthe various scraps of information which I derived from my worthy\r\nrelative, and other aged brethren of our order."\r\n\r\n"I presume, sir," said I, "though I would by no means intrude the\r\nquestion, that you are now returned to Scotland with a view to settle\r\namongst your countrymen, since the great political catastrophe of our\r\ntime has reduced your corps?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir," replied the Benedictine, "such is not my intention. A\r\nEuropean potentate, who still cherishes the Catholic faith, has offered\r\nus a retreat within his dominions, where a few of my scattered brethren\r\nare already assembled, to pray to God for blessings on their protector,\r\nand pardon to their enemies. No one, I believe, will be able to object\r\nto us under our new establishment, that the extent of our revenues will\r\nbe inconsistent with our vows of poverty and abstinence; but, let us\r\nstrive to be thankful to God, that the snare of temporal abundance is\r\nremoved from us."\r\n\r\n"Many of your convents abroad, sir," said I, "enjoyed very handsome\r\nincomes--and yet, allowing for times, I question if any were better\r\nprovided for than the Monastery of this village. It is said to have\r\npossessed nearly two thousand pounds in yearly money-rent, fourteen\r\nchalders and nine bolls of wheat, fifty-six chalders five bolls barley,\r\nforty-four chalders and ten bolls oats, capons and poultry, butter,\r\nsalt, carriage and arriage, peats and kain, wool and ale."\r\n\r\n"Even too much of all these temporal goods, sir," said my companion,\r\n"which, though well intended by the pious donors, served only to make\r\nthe establishment the envy and the prey of those by whom it was finally\r\ndevoured."\r\n\r\n"In the meanwhile, however," I observed, "the monks had an easy life of\r\nit, and, as the old song goes,\r\n\r\n  --made gude kale\r\n  On Fridays when they fasted."\r\n\r\n"I understand you, sir," said the Benedictine; "it is difficult, saith\r\nthe proverb, to carry a full cup without spilling. Unquestionably\r\nthe wealth of the community, as it endangered the safety of the\r\nestablishment by exciting the cupidity of others, was also in frequent\r\ninstances a snare to the brethren themselves. And yet we have seen\r\nthe revenues of convents expended, not only in acts of beneficence\r\nand hospitality to individuals, but in works of general and permanent\r\nadvantage to the world at large. The noble folio collection of French\r\nhistorians, commenced in 1737, under the inspection and at the expense\r\nof the community of Saint Maur, will long show that the revenues of\r\nthe Benedictines were not always spent in self-indulgence, and that the\r\nmembers of that order did not uniformly slumber in sloth and indolence,\r\nwhen they had discharged the formal duties of their rule."\r\n\r\nAs I knew nothing earthly at the time about the community of St. Maur,\r\nand their learned labours, I could only return a mumbling assent to\r\nthis proposition. I have since seen this noble work in the library of a\r\ndistinguished family, and I must own I am ashamed to reflect, that, in\r\nso wealthy a country as ours, a similar digest of our historians should\r\nnot be undertaken, under the patronage of the noble and the learned, in\r\nrivalry of that which the Benedictines of Paris executed at the expense\r\nof their own conventual funds.\r\n\r\n"I perceive," said the ex-Benedictine, smiling, "that your heretical\r\nprejudices are too strong to allow us poor brethren any merit, whether\r\nliterary or spiritual."\r\n\r\n"Far from it, sir," said I; "I assure you I have been much obliged to\r\nmonks in my time. When I was quartered in a Monastery in Flanders, in\r\nthe campaign of 1793, I never lived more comfortably in my life. They\r\nwere jolly fellows, the Flemish Canons, and right sorry was I to leave\r\nmy good quarters, and to know that my honest hosts were to be at the\r\nmercy of the Sans-Culottes. But _fortune de la guerre!_"\r\n\r\nThe poor Benedictine looked down and was silent. I had unwittingly\r\nawakened a train of bitter reflections, or rather I had touched somewhat\r\nrudely upon a chord which seldom ceased to vibrate of itself. But he\r\nwas too much accustomed to this sorrowful train of ideas to suffer it to\r\novercome him. On my part, I hastened to atone for my blunder. "If there\r\nwas any object of his journey to this country in which I could, with\r\npropriety, assist him, I begged to offer him my best services." I own\r\nI laid some little emphasis on the words "with propriety," as I felt it\r\nwould ill become me, a sound Protestant, and a servant of government so\r\nfar as my half-pay was concerned, to implicate myself in any recruiting\r\nwhich my companion might have undertaken in behalf of foreign\r\nseminaries, or in any similar design for the advancement of Popery,\r\nwhich, whether the Pope be actually the old lady of Babylon or no, it\r\ndid not become me in any manner to advance or countenance.\r\n\r\nMy new friend hastened to relieve my indecision. "I was about to request\r\nyour assistance, sir," he said, "in a matter which cannot but interest\r\nyou as an antiquary, and a person of research. But I assure you it\r\nrelates entirely to events and persons removed to the distance of two\r\ncenturies and a half. I have experienced too much evil from the violent\r\nunsettlement of the country in which I was born, to be a rash labourer\r\nin the work of innovation in that of my ancestors."\r\n\r\nI again assured him of my willingness to assist him in anything that was\r\nnot contrary to my allegiance or religion.\r\n\r\n"My proposal," he replied, "affects neither.--May God bless the reigning\r\nfamily in Britain! They are not, indeed, of that dynasty to restore\r\nwhich my ancestors struggled and suffered in vain; but the Providence\r\nwho has conducted his present Majesty to the throne, has given him the\r\nvirtues necessary to his time--firmness and intrepidity--a true love\r\nof his country, and an enlightened view of the dangers by which she is\r\nsurrounded.--For the religion of these realms, I am contented to hope\r\nthat the great Power, whose mysterious dispensation has rent them from\r\nthe bosom of the church, will, in his own good time and manner, restore\r\nthem to its holy pale. The efforts of an individual, obscure and\r\nhumble as myself, might well retard, but could never advance, a work so\r\nmighty."\r\n\r\n"May I then inquire, sir," said I, "with what purpose you seek this\r\ncountry?"\r\n\r\nEre my companion replied, he took from his pocket a clasped paper book,\r\nabout the size of a regimental orderly-book, full, as it seemed, of\r\nmemoranda; and, drawing one of the candles close to him, (for David,\r\nas a strong proof of his respect for the stranger, had indulged us with\r\ntwo,) he seemed to peruse the contents very earnestly.\r\n\r\n"There is among the ruins of the western end of the Abbey church," said\r\nhe, looking up to me, yet keeping the memorandum-book half open, and\r\noccasionally glancing at it, as if to refresh his memory, "a sort of\r\nrecess or chapel beneath a broken arch, and in the immediate vicinity\r\nof one of those shattered Gothic columns which once supported the\r\nmagnificent roof, whose fall has now encumbered that part of the\r\nbuilding with its ruins."\r\n\r\n"I think," said I, "that I know whereabouts you are. Is there not in the\r\nside wall of the chapel, or recess, which you mention, a large carved\r\nstone, bearing a coat of arms, which no one hitherto has been able to\r\ndecipher?"\r\n\r\n"You are right," answered the Benedictine; and again consulting\r\nhis memoranda, he added, "the arms on the dexter side are those of\r\nGlendinning, being a cross parted by a cross indented and countercharged\r\nof the same; and on the sinister three spur-rowels for those of Avenel;\r\nthey are two ancient families, now almost extinct in this country--the\r\narms _part y per pale_."\r\n\r\n"I think," said I, "there is no part of this ancient structure with\r\nwhich you are not as well acquainted as was the mason who built it. But\r\nif your information be correct, he who made out these bearings must have\r\nhad better eyes than mine."\r\n\r\n"His eyes," said the Benedictine, "have long been closed in death;\r\nprobably when he inspected the monument it was in a more perfect state,\r\nor he may have derived his information from the tradition of the place."\r\n\r\n"I assure you," said I, "that no such tradition now exists. I have\r\nmade several reconnoissances among the old people, in hopes to learn\r\nsomething of the armorial bearings, but I never heard of such a\r\ncircumstance. It seems odd that you should have acquired it in a foreign\r\nland."\r\n\r\n"These trifling particulars," he replied, "were formerly looked upon\r\nas more important, and they were sanctified to the exiles who retained\r\nrecollection of them, because they related to a place dear indeed to\r\nmemory, but which their eyes could never again behold. It is possible,\r\nin like manner, that on the Potomac or Susquehannah, you may find\r\ntraditions current concerning places in England, which are utterly\r\nforgotten in the neighbourhood where they originated. But to my purpose.\r\nIn this recess, marked by the armorial bearings, lies buried a treasure,\r\nand it is in order to remove it that I have undertaken my present\r\njourney."\r\n\r\n"A treasure!" echoed I, in astonishment.\r\n\r\n"Yes," replied the monk, "an inestimable treasure, for those who know\r\nhow to use it rightly."\r\n\r\nI own my ears did tingle a little at the word treasure, and that a\r\nhandsome tilbury, with a neat groom in blue and scarlet livery, having\r\na smart cockade on his glazed hat, seemed as it were to glide across the\r\nroom before gay eyes, while a voice, as of a crier, pronounced my ear,\r\n"Captain Clutterbuck\'s tilbury--drive up." But I resisted the devil, and\r\nhe fled from me.\r\n\r\n"I believe," said I, "all hidden treasure belongs either to the king or\r\nthe lord of the soil; and as I have served his majesty, I cannot\r\nconcern myself in any adventure which may have an end in the Court of\r\nExchequer."\r\n\r\n"The treasure I seek," said the stranger, smiling, "will not be envied\r\nby princes or nobles,---it is simply the heart of an upright man."\r\n\r\n"Ah! I understand you," I answered; "some relic, forgotten in the\r\nconfusion of the Reformation. I know the value which men of your\r\npersuasion put upon the bodies and limbs of saints. I have seen the\r\nThree Kings of Cologne."\r\n\r\n"The relics which I seek, however," said the Benedictine, "are not\r\nprecisely of that nature. The excellent relative whom I have already\r\nmentioned, amused his leisure hours with putting into form the\r\ntraditions of his family, particularly some remarkable circumstances\r\nwhich took place about the first breaking out of the schism of the\r\nchurch in Scotland. He became so much interested in his own labours,\r\nthat at length he resolved that the heart of one individual, the hero of\r\nhis tale, should rest no longer in a land of heresy, now deserted by all\r\nhis kindred. As he knew where it was deposited, he formed the resolution\r\nto visit his native country for the purpose of recovering this valued\r\nrelic. But age, and at length disease, interfered with his resolution,\r\nand it was on his deathbed that he charged me to undertake the task in\r\nhis stead. The various important events which have crowded upon each\r\nother, our ruin and our exile, have for many years obliged me to\r\npostpone this delegated duty. Why, indeed, transfer the relics of a holy\r\nand worthy man to a country, where religion and virtue are become\r\nthe mockery of the scorner? I have now a home, which I trust may be\r\npermanent, if any thing in this earth can be, termed so. Thither will I\r\ntransport the heart of the good father, and beside the shrine which it\r\nshall occupy, I will construct my own grave."\r\n\r\n"He must, indeed, have been an excellent man," replied I, "whose memory,\r\nat so distant a period, calls forth such strong marks of regard."\r\n\r\n"He was, as you justly term him," said the ecclesiastic, "indeed\r\nexcellent--excellent in his life and doctrine--excellent, above all, in\r\nhis self-denied and disinterested sacrifice of all that life holds dear\r\nto principle and to friendship. But you shall read his history. I shall\r\nbe happy at once to gratify your curiosity, and to show my sense of\r\nyour kindness, if you will have the goodness to procure me the means\r\nof accomplishing my object." I replied to the Benedictine, that, as the\r\nrubbish amongst which he proposed to search was no part of the ordinary\r\nburial-ground, and as I was on the best terms with the sexton, I had\r\nlittle doubt that I could procure him the means of executing his pious\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nWith this promise we parted for the night; and on the ensuing morning\r\nI made it my business to see the sexton, who, for a small gratuity,\r\nreadily granted permission of search, on condition, however, that he\r\nshould be present himself, to see that the stranger removed nothing of\r\nintrinsic value.\r\n\r\n"To banes, and skulls, and hearts, if he can find ony, he shall be\r\nwelcome," said this guardian of the ruined Monastery, "there\'s plenty\r\na\' about, an he\'s curious of them; but if there be ony picts" (meaning\r\nperhaps _pyx_) "or chalishes, or the like of such Popish veshells of\r\ngold and silver, deil hae me an I conneve at their being removed."\r\n\r\nThe sexton also stipulated, that our researches should take place at\r\nnight, being unwilling to excite observation, or give rise to scandal.\r\nMy new acquaintance and I spent the day as became lovers of hoar\r\nantiquity. We visited every corner of these magnificent ruins again\r\nand again during the forenoon; and, having made a comfortable dinner at\r\nDavid\'s, we walked in the afternoon to such places in the neighbourhood\r\nas ancient tradition or modern conjecture had rendered mark worthy.\r\nNight found us in the interior of the ruins, attended by the sexton, who\r\ncarried a dark lantern, and stumbling alternately over the graves of\r\nthe dead, and the fragments of that architecture, which they doubtless\r\ntrusted would have canopied their bones till doomsday.\r\n\r\nI am by no means particularly superstitious, and yet there was that in\r\nthe present service which I did not very much like. There was something\r\nawful in the resolution of disturbing, at such an hour, and in such a\r\nplace, the still and mute sanctity of the grave. My companions were free\r\nfrom this impression--the stranger from his energetic desire to\r\nexecute the purpose for which he came--and the sexton from habitual\r\nindifference. We soon stood in the aisle, which, by the account of the\r\nBenedictine, contained the bones of the family of Glendinning, and were\r\nbusily employed in removing the rubbish from a corner which the stranger\r\npointed out. If a half-pay Captain could have represented an ancient\r\nBorder-knight, or an ex-Benedictine of the nineteenth century a wizard\r\nmonk of the sixteenth, we might have aptly enough personified the search\r\nafter Michael Scott\'s lamp and book of magic power. But the sexton\r\nwould have been _de trop_ in the group. [Footnote: This is one of those\r\npassages which must now read awkwardly, since every one knows that the\r\nNovelist and the author of the Lay of the Minstrel, is the same person.\r\nBut before the avowal was made, the author was forced into this\r\nand similar offences against good taste, to meet an argument, often\r\nrepeated, that there was something very mysterious in the Author of\r\nWaverley\'s reserve concerning Sir Walter Scott, an author sufficiently\r\nvoluminous at least. I had a great mind to remove the passages from this\r\nedition, but the more candid way is to explain how they came there.]\r\n\r\nEre the stranger, assisted by the sexton in his task, had been long at\r\nwork, they came to some hewn stones, which seemed to have made part of a\r\nsmall shrine, though now displaced and destroyed.\r\n\r\n"Let us remove these with caution, my friend," said the stranger, "lest\r\nwe injure that which I come to seek."\r\n\r\n"They are prime stanes," said the sexton, "picked free every ane of\r\nthem;--warse than the best wad never serve the monks, I\'se warrant."\r\n\r\nA minute after he had made this observation, he exclaimed, "I hae fund\r\nsomething now that stands again\' the spade, as if it were neither earth\r\nnor stane."\r\n\r\nThe stranger stooped eagerly to assist him.\r\n\r\n"Na, na, haill o\' my ain," said the sexton; "nae halves or\r\nquarters;"--and he lifted from amongst the ruins a small leaden box.\r\n\r\n"You will be disappointed, my friend," said the Benedictine, "if you\r\nexpect any thing there but the mouldering dust of a human heart, closed\r\nin an inner case of porphyry."\r\n\r\nI interposed as a neutral party, and taking the box from the sexton,\r\nreminded him, that if there were treasure concealed in it, still it\r\ncould not become the property of the finder. I then proposed, that as\r\nthe place was too dark to examine the contents of the leaden casket, we\r\nshould adjourn to David\'s, where we might have the advantage of light\r\nand fire while carrying on our investigation. The stranger requested us\r\nto go before, assuring us that he would follow in a few minutes.\r\n\r\nI fancy that old Mattocks suspected these few minutes might be employed\r\nin effecting farther discoveries amongst the tombs, for he glided back\r\nthrough a side-aisle to watch the Benedictine\'s motions, but presently\r\nreturned, and told me in a whisper that "the gentleman was on his knees\r\namang the cauld stanes, praying like ony saunt."\r\n\r\nI stole back, and beheld the old man actually employed as Mattocks had\r\ninformed me. The language seemed to be Latin; and as, the whispered, yet\r\nsolemn accent, glided away through the ruined aisles, I could not\r\nhelp reflecting how long it was since they had heard the forms of that\r\nreligion, for the exercise of which they had been reared at such cost of\r\ntime, taste, labour, and expense. "Come away, come away," said I; "let\r\nus leave him to himself, Mattocks; this is no business of ours."\r\n\r\n"My certes, no, Captain," said Mattocks; "ne\'ertheless, it winna\r\nbe amiss to keep an eye on him. My father, rest his saul, was a\r\nhorse-couper, and used to say he never was cheated in a naig in his\r\nlife, saving by a west-country whig frae Kilmarnock, that said a\r\ngrace ower a dram o\' whisky. But this gentleman will be a Roman, I\'se\r\nwarrant?"\r\n\r\n"You are perfectly right in that, Saunders," said I.\r\n\r\n"Ay, I have seen twa or three of their priests that were chased ower\r\nhere some score o\' years syne. They just danced like mad when they\r\nlooked on the friars\' heads, and the nuns\' heads, in the cloister\r\nyonder; they took to them like auld acquaintance like.--Od, he is\r\nnot stirring yet, mair than he were a through-stane! [Footnote: A\r\ntombstone.] I never kend a Roman, to say kend him, but ane--mair by\r\ntoken, he was the only ane in the town to ken--and that was auld Jock of\r\nthe Pend. It wad hae been lang ere ye fand Jock praying in the Abbey in\r\na thick night, wi\' his knees on a cauld stane. Jock likit a kirk wi\'\r\na chimley in\'t. Mony a merry ploy I hae had wi\' him down at the inn\r\nyonder; and when he died, decently I wad hae earded him; but, or I gat\r\nhis grave weel howkit, some of the quality, that were o\' his ain unhappy\r\npersuasion, had the corpse whirried away up the water, and buried him\r\nafter their ain pleasure, doubtless--they kend best. I wad hae made\r\nnae great charge. I wadna hae excised Johnnie, dead or alive.--Stay,\r\nsee--the strange gentleman is coming."\r\n\r\n"Hold the lantern to assist him, Mattocks," said I.--"This is rough\r\nwalking, sir."\r\n\r\n"Yes," replied the Benedictine; "I may say with a poet, who is doubtless\r\nfamiliar to you----"\r\n\r\nI should be surprised if he were, thought I internally.\r\n\r\nThe stranger continued:\r\n\r\n  "Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night\r\n  Have my old feet stumbled at graves!"\r\n\r\n"We are now clear of the churchyard," said I, "and have but a short walk\r\nto David\'s, where I hope we shall find a cheerful fire to enliven us\r\nafter our night\'s work."\r\n\r\nWe entered, accordingly, the little parlour, into which Mattocks was\r\nalso about to push himself with sufficient effrontery, when David, with\r\na most astounding oath, expelled him by head and shoulders, d--ning his\r\ncuriosity, that would not let gentlemen be private in their own inn.\r\nApparently mine host considered his own presence as no intrusion, for he\r\ncrowded up to the table on which I had laid down the leaden box. It was\r\nfrail and wasted, as might be guessed, from having lain so many years\r\nin the ground. On opening it, we found deposited within, a case made of\r\nporphyry, as the stranger had announced to us.\r\n\r\n"I fancy," he said, "gentlemen, your curiosity will not be\r\nsatisfied,--perhaps I should say that your suspicions will not be\r\nremoved,--unless I undo this casket; yet it only contains the mouldering\r\nremains of a heart, once the seat of the noblest thoughts."\r\n\r\nHe undid the box with great caution; but the shrivelled substance which\r\nit contained bore now no resemblance to what it might once have been,\r\nthe means used having been apparently unequal to preserve its shape and\r\ncolour, although they were adequate to prevent its total decay. We\r\nwere quite satisfied, notwithstanding, that it was, what the stranger\r\nasserted, the remains of a human heart; and David readily promised his\r\ninfluence in the village, which was almost co-ordinate with that of the\r\nbailie himself, to silence all idle rumours. He was, moreover, pleased\r\nto favour us with his company to supper; and having taken the lion\'s\r\nshare of two bottles of sherry, he not only sanctioned with his plenary\r\nauthority the stranger\'s removal of the heart, but, I believe, would\r\nhave authorized the removal of the Abbey itself, were it not that it\r\nhappens considerably to advantage the worthy publican\'s own custom.\r\n\r\nThe object of the Benedictine\'s visit to the land of his forefathers\r\nbeing now accomplished, he announced his intention of leaving us early\r\nin the ensuing day, but requested my company to breakfast with him\r\nbefore his departure. I came accordingly, and when we had finished our\r\nmorning\'s meal, the priest took me apart, and pulling from his pocket\r\na large bundle of papers, he put them into my hands. "These," said he,\r\n"Captain Clutterbuck, are genuine Memoirs of the sixteenth century, and\r\nexhibit in a singular, and, as I think, an interesting point of\r\nview, the manners of that period. I am induced to believe that their\r\npublication will not be an unacceptable present to the British public;\r\nand willingly make over to you any profit that may accrue from such a\r\ntransaction."\r\n\r\nI stared a little at this annunciation, and observed, that the hand\r\nseemed too modern for the date he assigned to the manuscript.\r\n\r\n"Do not mistake me, sir," said the Benedictine; "I did not mean to say\r\nthe Memoirs were written in the sixteenth century, but only, that they\r\nwere compiled from authentic materials of that period, but written in\r\nthe taste and language of the present day. My uncle commenced this book;\r\nand I, partly to improve my habit of English composition, partly to\r\ndivert melancholy thoughts, amused my leisure hours with continuing\r\nand concluding it. You will see the period of the story where my uncle\r\nleaves off his narrative, and I commence mine. In fact, they relate in a\r\ngreat measure to different persons, as well as to a different period."\r\n\r\nRetaining the papers in my hand, I proceeded to state to him my doubts,\r\nwhether, as a good Protestant, I could undertake or superintend a\r\npublication written probably in the spirit of Popery.\r\n\r\n"You will find," he said, "no matter of controversy in these sheets, nor\r\nany sentiments stated, with which, I trust, the good in all persuasions\r\nwill not be willing to join. I remembered I was writing for a land\r\nunhappily divided from the Catholic faith; and I have taken care to say\r\nnothing which, justly interpreted, could give ground for accusing me of\r\npartiality. But if, upon collating my narrative with the proofs to which\r\nI refer you--for you will find copies of many of the original papers\r\nin that parcel--you are of opinion that I have been partial to my own\r\nfaith, I freely give you leave to correct my errors in that respect. I\r\nown, however, I am not conscious of this defect, and have rather to\r\nfear that the Catholics may be of opinion, that I have mentioned\r\ncircumstances respecting the decay of discipline which preceded, and\r\npartly occasioned, the great schism, called by you the Reformation, over\r\nwhich I ought to have drawn a veil. And indeed, this is one reason why I\r\nchoose the papers should appear in a foreign land, and pass to the press\r\nthrough the hands of a stranger."\r\n\r\nTo this I had nothing to reply, unless to object my own incompetency to\r\nthe task the good father was desirous to impose upon me. On this subject\r\nhe was pleased to say more, I fear, than his knowledge of me fully\r\nwarranted--more, at any rate, than my modesty will permit me to record.\r\nAt length he ended, with advising me, if I continued to feel the\r\ndiffidence which I stated, to apply to some veteran of literature, whose\r\nexperience might supply my deficiencies. Upon these terms we parted,\r\nwith mutual expressions of regard, and I have never since heard of him.\r\n\r\nAfter several attempts to peruse the quires of paper thus singularly\r\nconferred on me, in which I was interrupted by the most inexplicable\r\nfits of yawning, I at length, in a sort of despair, communicated them to\r\nour village club, from whom they found a more favourable reception than\r\nthe unlucky conformation of my nerves had been able to afford them. They\r\nunanimously pronounced the work to be exceedingly good, and assured me\r\nI would be guilty of the greatest possible injury to our flourishing\r\nvillage, if I should suppress what threw such an interesting and radiant\r\nlight upon the history of the ancient Monastery of Saint Mary.\r\n\r\nAt length, by dint of listening to their opinion, I became dubious of my\r\nown; and, indeed, when I heard passages read forth by the sonorous voice\r\nof our worthy pastor, I was scarce more tired than I have felt myself\r\nat some of his own sermons. Such, and so great is the difference\r\nbetwixt reading a thing one\'s self, making toilsome way through all the\r\ndifficulties of manuscript, and, as the man says in the play, "having\r\nthe same read to you;"--it is positively like being wafted over a creek\r\nin a boat, or wading through it on your feet, with the mud up to your\r\nknees. Still, however, there remained the great difficulty of finding\r\nsome one who could act as editor, corrector at once of the press and\r\nof the language, which, according to the schoolmaster, was absolutely\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nSince the trees walked forth to choose themselves a king, never was an\r\nhonour so bandied about. The parson would not leave the quiet of his\r\nchimney-corner--the bailie pleaded the dignity of his situation, and the\r\napproach of the great annual fair, as reasons against going to Edinburgh\r\nto make arrangements for printing the Benedictine\'s manuscript. The\r\nschoolmaster alone seemed of malleable stuff; and, desirous perhaps of\r\nemulating the fame of Jedediah Cleishbotham, evinced a wish to undertake\r\nthis momentous commission. But a remonstrance from three opulent\r\nfarmers, whose sons he had at bed, board, and schooling, for twenty\r\npounds per annum a-head, came like a frost over the blossoms of his\r\nliterary ambition, and he was compelled to decline the service.\r\n\r\nIn these circumstances, sir, I apply to you, by the advice of our little\r\ncouncil of war, nothing doubting you will not be disinclined to take\r\nthe duty upon you, as it is much connected with that in which you have\r\ndistinguished yourself. What I request is, that you will review, or\r\nrather revise and correct, the enclosed packet, and prepare it for the\r\npress, by such alterations, additions, and curtailments, as you think\r\nnecessary. Forgive my hinting to you, that the deepest well may be\r\nexhausted,--the best corps of grenadiers, as our old general of brigade\r\nexpressed himself, may be _used up_. A few hints can do you no harm;\r\nand, for the prize-money, let the battle be first won, and it shall be\r\nparted at the drum-head. I hope you will take nothing amiss that I have\r\nsaid. I am a plain soldier, and little accustomed to compliments. I\r\nmay add, that I should be well contented to march in the front with\r\nyou--that is, to put my name with yours on the title-page. I have the\r\nhonour to be, Sir, Your unknown humble Servant, Cuthbert Clutterbuck.\r\nVillage of Kennaquhair, -- of April, 18--\r\n\r\n_For the Author of "Waverley," &c. care of Mr. John Ballantyne, Hanover\r\nStreet, Edinburgh._\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *        *       *        *\r\n\r\n\r\nANSWER BY "THE AUTHOR OF WAVERLEY,"\r\n\r\nTO THE FOREGOING LETTER FROM CAPTAIN CLUTTERBUCK.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR CAPTAIN,\r\n\r\nDo not admire, that, notwithstanding the distance and ceremony of your\r\naddress, I return an answer in the terms of familiarity. The truth\r\nis, your origin and native country are better known to me than even to\r\nyourself. You derive your respectable parentage, if I am not greatly\r\nmistaken, from a land which has afforded much pleasure, as well as\r\nprofit, to those who have traded to it successfully,--I mean that part\r\nof the _terra incognita_ which is called the province of Utopia. Its\r\nproductions, though censured by many (and some who use tea and tobacco\r\nwithout scruple) as idle and unsubstantial luxuries, have nevertheless,\r\nlike many other luxuries, a general acceptation, and are secretly\r\nenjoyed even by those who express the greatest scorn and dislike of\r\nthem in public. The dram-drinker is often the first to be shocked at the\r\nsmell of spirits--it is not unusual to hear old maiden ladies declaim\r\nagainst scandal--the private book-cases of some grave-seeming men would\r\nnot brook decent eyes--and many, I say not of the wise and learned,\r\nbut of those most anxious to seem such, when the spring-lock of their\r\nlibrary is drawn, their velvet cap pulled over their ears, their feet\r\ninsinuated into their turkey slippers, are to be found, were their\r\nretreats suddenly intruded upon, busily engaged with the last new novel.\r\n\r\nI have said, the truly wise and learned disdain these shifts, and\r\nwill open the said novel as avowedly as they would the lid of their\r\nsnuff-box. I will only quote one instance, though I know a hundred.\r\nDid you know the celebrated Watt of Birmingham, Captain Clutterbuck? I\r\nbelieve not, though, from what I am about to state, he would not have\r\nfailed to have sought an acquaintance with you. It was only once my\r\nfortune to meet him, whether in body or in spirit it matters not.\r\nThere were assembled about half a score of our Northern Lights, who had\r\namongst them, Heaven knows how, a well-known character of your country,\r\nJedediah Cleishbotham. This worthy person, having come to Edinburgh\r\nduring the Christmas vacation, had become a sort of lion in the place,\r\nand was lead in leash from house to house along with the guisards, the\r\nstone-eater, and other amusements of the season, which "exhibited their\r\nunparalleled feats to private family-parties, if required." Amidst this\r\ncompany stood Mr. Watt, the man whose genius discovered the means of\r\nmultiplying our national resources to a degree perhaps even beyond\r\nhis own stupendous powers of calculation and combination; bringing the\r\ntreasures of the abyss to the summit of the earth--giving the feeble arm\r\nof man the momentum of an Afrite--commanding manufactures to arise, as\r\nthe rod of the prophet produced water in the desert--affording the means\r\nof dispensing with that time and tide which wait for no man, and of\r\nsailing without that wind which defied the commands and threats of\r\nXerxes himself.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Probably the ingenious author alludes to the national adage:\r\n\r\n  The king said sail,\r\n  But the wind said no.\r\n\r\nOur schoolmaster (who is also a land surveyor) thinks this whole passage\r\nrefers to Mr. Watt\'s improvements on the steam engine.--_Note by Captain\r\nClutterbuck_.]\r\n\r\nThis potent commander of the elements--this abridger of time and\r\nspace--this magician, whose cloudy machinery has produced a change on\r\nthe world, the effects of which, extraordinary as they are, are perhaps\r\nonly now beginning to be felt--was not only the most profound man\r\nof science, the most successful combiner of powers and calculator of\r\nnumbers as adapted to practical purposes,--was not only one of the\r\nmost generally well-informed,--but one of the best and kindest of human\r\nbeings.\r\n\r\nThere he stood, surrounded by the little band I have mentioned of\r\nNorthern literati, men not less tenacious, generally speaking, of\r\ntheir own fame and their own opinions, than the national regiments are\r\nsupposed to be jealous of the high character which they have won upon\r\nservice. Methinks I yet see and hear what I shall never see or hear\r\nagain. In his eighty-fifth year, the alert, kind, benevolent old man,\r\nhad his attention alive to every one\'s question, his information at\r\nevery one\'s command.\r\n\r\nHis talents and fancy overflowed on every subject. One gentleman was a\r\ndeep philologist--he talked with him on the origin of the alphabet as if\r\nhe had been coeval with Cadmus; another a celebrated critic,--you would\r\nhave said the old man had studied political economy and belles-lettres\r\nall his life,--of science it is unnecessary to speak, it was his own\r\ndistinguished walk. And yet, Captain Clutterbuck, when he spoke with\r\nyour countryman Jedediah Cleishbotham, you would have sworn he had been\r\ncoeval with Claver\'se and Burley, with the persecutors and persecuted,\r\nand could number every shot the dragoons had fired at the fugitive\r\nCovenanters. In fact, we discovered that no novel of the least celebrity\r\nescaped his perusal, and that the gifted man of science was as much\r\naddicted to the productions of your native country, (the land of Utopia\r\naforesaid,) in other words, as shameless and obstinate a peruser of\r\nnovels, as if he had been a very milliner\'s apprentice of eighteen. I\r\nknow little apology for troubling you with these things, excepting the\r\ndesire to commemorate a delightful evening, and a wish to encourage\r\nyou to shake off that modest diffidence which makes you afraid of being\r\nsupposed connected with the fairy-land of delusive fiction. I will\r\nrequite your tag of verse, from Horace himself, with a paraphrase\r\nfor your own use, my dear Captain, and for that of your country club,\r\nexcepting in reverence the clergyman and schoolmaster:--\r\n\r\n  _Ne sit ancillae tibi amor pudori, &c._\r\n\r\n  Take thou no scorn.\r\n  Of fiction born,\r\n  Fair fiction\'s muse to woe;\r\n  Old Homer\'s theme\r\n  Was but a dream,\r\n  Himself a fiction too.\r\n\r\nHaving told you your country, I must next, my dear Captain Clutterbuck,\r\nmake free to mention your own immediate descent. You are not to suppose\r\nyour land of prodigies so little known to us as the careful concealment\r\nof your origin would seem to imply. But you have it in common with many\r\nof your country, studiously and anxiously to hide any connexion with it.\r\nThere is this difference, indeed, betwixt your countrymen and those of\r\nour more material world, that many of the most estimable of them, such\r\nas an old Highland gentleman called Ossian, a monk of Bristol called\r\nRowley, and others, are inclined to pass themselves off as denizens of\r\nthe land of reality, whereas most of our fellow-citizens who deny their\r\ncountry are such as that country would be very willing to disclaim. The\r\nespecial circumstances you mention relating to your life and services,\r\nimpose not upon us. We know the versatility of the unsubstantial species\r\nto which you belong permits them to assume all manner of disguises; we\r\nhave seen them apparelled in the caftan of a Persian, and the silken\r\nrobe of a Chinese, [Footnote: See the Persian Letters, and the Citizen\r\nof the World.] and are prepared to suspect their real character under\r\nevery disguise. But how can we be ignorant of your country and manners,\r\nor deceived by the evasion of its inhabitants, when the voyages of\r\ndiscovery which have been made to it rival in number those recorded by\r\nPurchas or by Hackluyt? [Footnote: See Les Voyages Imaginaires.] And to\r\nshow the skill and perseverance of your navigators and travellers, we\r\nhave only to name Sindbad, Aboulfouaris, and Robinson Crusoe. These were\r\nthe men for discoveries. Could we have sent Captain Greenland to look\r\nout for the north-west passage, or Peter Wilkins to examine Baffin\'s\r\nBay, what discoveries might we not have expected? But there are feats,\r\nand these both numerous and extraordinary, performed by the inhabitants\r\nof your country, which we read without once attempting to emulate.\r\n\r\nI wander from my purpose, which was to assure you, that I know you as\r\nwell as the mother who _did_ not bear you, for MacDuff\'s peculiarity\r\nsticks to your whole race. You are not born of woman, unless, indeed, in\r\nthat figurative sense, in which the celebrated Maria Edgeworth may, in\r\nher state of single blessedness, be termed mother of the finest family\r\nin England. You belong, sir, to the Editors of the land of Utopia, a\r\nsort of persons for whom I have the highest esteem. How is it possible\r\nit should be otherwise, when you reckon among your corporation the sage\r\nCid Hamet Benengeli, the short-faced president of the Spectator\'s Club,\r\npoor Ben Silton, and many others, who have acted as gentlemen-ushers to\r\nworks which have cheered our heaviest, and added wings to our lightest\r\nhours?\r\n\r\nWhat I have remarked as peculiar to Editors of the class in which\r\nI venture to enrol you, is the happy combination of fortuitous\r\ncircumstances which usually put you in possession of the works which\r\nyou have the goodness to bring into public notice. One walks on the\r\nsea-shore, and a wave casts on land a small cylindrical trunk or casket,\r\ncontaining a manuscript much damaged with sea-water, which is with\r\ndifficulty deciphered, and so forth. [Footnote: See the History of\r\nAutomathes.] Another steps into a chandler\'s shop, to purchase a pound\r\nof butter, and, behold! the waste-paper on which it is laid is the\r\nmanuscript of a cabalist. [Footnote: Adventures of a Guinea.] A third\r\nis so fortunate as to obtain from a woman who lets lodgings, the curious\r\ncontents of an antique bureau, the property of a deceased lodger.\r\n[Footnote: Adventures of an Atom.] All these are certainly possible\r\noccurrences; but, I know not how, they seldom occur to any Editors save\r\nthose of your country. At least I can answer for myself, that in my\r\nsolitary walks by the sea, I never saw it cast ashore any thing but\r\ndulse and tangle, and now and then a deceased star-fish; my landlady\r\nnever presented me with any manuscript save her cursed bill; and the\r\nmost interesting of my discoveries in the way of waste-paper, was\r\nfinding a favourite passage of one of my own novels wrapt round an ounce\r\nof snuff. No, Captain, the funds from which I have drawn my power\r\nof amusing the public, have been bought otherwise than by fortuitous\r\nadventure. I have buried myself in libraries to extract from the\r\nnonsense of ancient days new nonsense of my own. I have turned over\r\nvolumes, which, from the pot-hooks I was obliged to decipher, might have\r\nbeen the cabalistic manuscripts of Cornelius Agrippa, although I never\r\nsaw "the door open and the devil come in." [Footnote: See Southey\'s\r\nBallad on the Young Man who read in a Conjuror\'s Books.] But all the\r\ndomestic inhabitants of the libraries were disturbed by the vehemence of\r\nmy studies:--\r\n\r\n  From my research the boldest spider fled,\r\n  And moths, retreating, trembled as I read;\r\n\r\nFrom this learned sepulchre I emerged like the Magician in the Persian\r\nTales, from his twelve-month\'s residence in the mountain, not like him\r\nto soar over the heads of the multitude, but to mingle in the crowd, and\r\nto elbow amongst the throng, making my way from the highest society\r\nto the lowest, undergoing the scorn, or, what is harder to brook,\r\nthe patronizing condescension of the one, and enduring the vulgar\r\nfamiliarity of the other,--and all, you will say, for what?--to collect\r\nmaterials for one of those manuscripts with which mere chance so often\r\naccommodates your country-men; in other words, to write a successful\r\nnovel.--"O Athenians, how hard we labour to deserve your praise!"\r\n\r\nI might stop here, my dear Clutterbuck; it would have a touching effect,\r\nand the air of proper deference to our dear Public. But I will not\r\nbe false with you,--(though falsehood is--excuse the observation--the\r\ncurrent coin of your country,) the truth is, I have studied and lived\r\nfor the purpose of gratifying my own curiosity, and passing my own time;\r\nand though the result has been, that, in one shape or other, I have\r\nbeen frequently before the Public, perhaps more frequently than prudence\r\nwarranted, yet I cannot claim from them the favour due to those who have\r\ndedicated their ease and leisure to the improvement and entertainment of\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nHaving communicated thus freely with you, my dear Captain, it follows,\r\nof course, that I will gratefully accept of your communication, which,\r\nas your Benedictine observed, divides itself both by subject, manner,\r\nand age, into two parts. But I am sorry I cannot gratify your literary\r\nambition, by suffering your name to appear upon the title-page; and I\r\nwill candidly tell you the reason.\r\n\r\nThe Editors of your country are of such a soft and passive disposition,\r\nthat they have frequently done themselves great disgrace by giving up\r\nthe coadjutors who first brought them into public notice and public\r\nfavour, and suffering their names to be used by those quacks and\r\nimpostors who live upon the ideas of others. Thus I shame to tell how\r\nthe sage Cid Hamet Benengeli was induced by one Juan Avellaneda to play\r\nthe Turk with the ingenious Miguel Cervantes, and to publish a Second\r\nPart of the adventures of his hero the renowned Don Quixote, without the\r\nknowledge or co-operation of his principal aforesaid. It is true, the\r\nArabian sage returned to his allegiance, and thereafter composed a\r\ngenuine continuation of the Knight of La Mancha, in which the said\r\nAvellaneda of Tordesillas is severely chastised. For in this you\r\npseudo-editors resemble the juggler\'s disciplined ape, to which a sly\r\nold Scotsman likened James I., "if you have Jackoo in your hand, you can\r\nmake him bite me; if I have Jackoo in my hand, I can make him bite\r\nyou." Yet, notwithstanding the _amende honorable_ thus made by Cid Hamet\r\nBenengeli, his temporary defection did not the less occasion the decease\r\nof the ingenious Hidalgo Don Quixote, if he can be said to die, whose\r\nmemory is immortal. Cervantes put him to death, lest he should again\r\nfall into bad hands. Awful, yet just consequence of Cid Hamet\'s\r\ndefection!\r\n\r\nTo quote a more modern and much less important instance. I am sorry to\r\nobserve my old acquaintance Jedediah Cleishbotham has misbehaved himself\r\nso far as to desert his original patron, and set up for himself. I am\r\nafraid the poor pedagogue will make little by his new allies, unless\r\nthe pleasure of entertaining the public, and, for aught I know, the\r\ngentlemen of the long robe, with disputes about his identity.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: I am since more correctly informed, that Mr. Cleishbotham\r\ndied some months since at Gandercleuch, and that the person assuming\r\nhis name is an impostor. The real Jedediah made a most Christian\r\nand edifying end; and, as I am credibly informed, having sent for a\r\nCameronian clergyman when he was _in extremis_, was so fortunate as to\r\nconvince the good man, that, after all, he had no wish to bring down on\r\nthe scattered remnant of Mountain folks, "the bonnets of Bonny Dundee."\r\nHard that the speculators in print and paper will not allow a good man\r\nto rest quiet in his grave.\r\n\r\nThis note, and the passages in the text, were occasioned by a London\r\nbookseller having printed, as a Speculation, an additional collection\r\nof Tales of My Landlord, which was not so fortunate as to succeed in\r\npassing on the world as genuine.]\r\n\r\nObserve, therefore, Captain Clutterbuck, that, wise by these great\r\nexamples, I receive you as a partner, but a sleeping partner only. As\r\nI give you no title to employ or use the firm of the copartnery we are\r\nabout to form, I will announce my property in my title-page, and put my\r\nown mark on my own chattels, which the attorney tells me it will be a\r\ncrime to counterfeit, as much as it would to imitate the autograph of\r\nany other empiric--a crime amounting, as advertisements upon little\r\nvials assure to us, to nothing short of felony. If, therefore, my dear\r\nfriend, your name should hereafter appear in any title-page without\r\nmine, readers will know what to think of you. I scorn to use either\r\narguments or threats; but you cannot but be sensible, that, as you owe\r\nyour literary existence to me on the one hand, so, on the other, your\r\nvery all is at my disposal. I can at pleasure cut off your annuity,\r\nstrike your name from the half-pay establishment, nay, actually put you\r\nto death, without being answerable to any one.

The learned Chalmers derives\r\nthis word Quhair, from the winding course of a stream; a definition\r\nwhich coincides, in a remarkable degree, with the serpentine turns of\r\nthe river Tweed near the village of which we speak. It has been long\r\nfamous for the splendid Monastery of Saint Mary, founded by David the\r\nFirst of Scotland, in whose reign were formed, in the same county, the\r\nno less splendid establishments of Melrose, Jedburgh, and Kelso. The\r\ndonations of land with which the King endowed these wealthy fraternities\r\nprocured him from the Monkish historians the epithet of Saint, and from\r\none of his impoverished descendants the splenetic censure, "that he had\r\nbeen a sore saint for the Crown."\r\n\r\nIt seems probable, notwithstanding, that David, who was a wise as well\r\nas a pious monarch, was not moved solely by religious motives to those\r\ngreat acts of munificence to the church, but annexed political views to\r\nhis pious generosity. His possessions in Northumberland and Cumberland\r\nbecame precarious after the loss of the Battle of the Standard; and\r\nsince the comparatively fertile valley of Teviot-dale was likely to\r\nbecome the frontier of his kingdom, it is probable he wished to secure\r\nat least a part of these valuable possessions by placing them in the\r\nhands of the monks, whose property was for a long time respected, even\r\namidst the rage of a frontier war. In this manner alone had the King\r\nsome chance of ensuring protection and security to the cultivators of\r\nthe soil; and, in fact, for several ages the possessions of these\r\nAbbeys were each a sort of Goshen, enjoying the calm light of peace\r\nand immunity, while the rest of the country, occupied by wild clans and\r\nmarauding barons, was one dark scene of confusion, blood, and unremitted\r\noutrage.\r\n\r\nBut these immunities did not continue down to the union of the crowns.\r\nLong before that period the wars betwixt England and Scotland had lost\r\ntheir original character of international hostilities, and had become\r\non the part of the English, a struggle for subjugation, on that of\r\nthe Scots a desperate and infuriated defence of their liberties. This\r\nintroduced on both sides a degree of fury and animosity unknown to the\r\nearlier period of their history; and as religious scruples soon gave way\r\nto national hatred spurred by a love of plunder, the patrimony of the\r\nChurch was no longer sacred from incursions on either side. Still,\r\nhowever, the tenants and vassals of the great Abbeys had many advantages\r\nover those of the lay barons, who were harassed by constant military\r\nduty, until they became desperate, and lost all relish for the arts of\r\npeace. The vassals of the church, on the other hand, were only liable\r\nto be called to arms on general occasions, and at other times were\r\npermitted in comparative quiet to possess their farms and feus.\r\n[Footnote: Small possessions conferred upon vassals and their heirs,\r\nheld for a small quit-rent, or a moderate proportion of the produce.\r\nThis was a favourite manner, by which the churchmen peopled the\r\npatrimony of their convents; and many descendants of such _feuars_, as\r\nthey are culled, are still to be found in possession of their family\r\ninheritances in the neighbourhood of the great Monasteries of Scotland.]\r\nThey of course exhibited superior skill in every thing that related\r\nto the cultivation of the soil, and were therefore both wealthier and\r\nbetter informed than the military retainers of the restless chiefs and\r\nnobles in their neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nThe residence of these church vassals was usually in a small village or\r\nhamlet, where, for the sake of mutual aid and protection, some thirty\r\nor forty families dwelt together. This was called the Town, and the land\r\nbelonging to the various families by whom the Town was inhabited, was\r\ncalled the Township. They usually possessed the land in common, though\r\nin various proportions, according to their several grants. The part of\r\nthe Township properly arable, and kept as such continually under the\r\nplough, was called _in-field_. Here the use of quantities of manure\r\nsupplied in some degree the exhaustion of the soil, and the feuars\r\nraised tolerable oats and bear, [Footnote: Or bigg, a kind of coarse\r\nbarley.] usually sowed on alternate ridges, on which the labour of the\r\nwhole community was bestowed without distinction, the produce being\r\ndivided after harvest, agreeably to their respective interests.\r\n\r\nThere was, besides, _out-field_ land, from which it was thought possible\r\nto extract a crop now and then, after which it was abandoned to the\r\n"skiey influences," until the exhausted powers of vegetation were\r\nrestored. These out-field spots were selected by any feuar at his own\r\nchoice, amongst the sheep-walks and hills which were always annexed to\r\nthe Township, to serve as pasturage to the community. The trouble of\r\ncultivating these patches of out-field, and the precarious chance that\r\nthe crop would pay the labour, were considered as giving a right to any\r\nfeuar, who chose to undertake the adventure, to the produce which might\r\nresult from it.\r\n\r\nThere remained the pasturage of extensive moors, where the valleys often\r\nafforded good grass, and upon which the whole cattle belonging to the\r\ncommunity fed indiscriminately during the summer, under the charge of\r\nthe Town-herd, who regularly drove them out to pasture in the morning,\r\nand brought them back at night, without which precaution they would\r\nhave fallen a speedy prey to some of the Snatchers in the neighbourhood.\r\nThese are things to make modern agriculturists hold up their hands and\r\nstare; but the same mode of cultivation is not yet entirely in desuetude\r\nin some distant parts of North Britain, and may be witnessed in full\r\nforce and exercise in the Zetland Archipelago.\r\n\r\nThe habitations of the church-feuars were not less primitive than their\r\nagriculture. In each village or town were several small towers, having\r\nbattlements projecting over the side walls, and usually an advanced\r\nangle or two with shot-holes for flanking the door-way, which was always\r\ndefended by a strong door of oak, studded with nails, and often by an\r\nexterior grated door of iron. These small peel-houses were ordinarily\r\ninhabited by the principal feuars and their families; but, upon the\r\nalarm of approaching danger, the whole inhabitants thronged from their\r\nown miserable cottages, which were situated around, to garrison these\r\npoints of defence. It was then no easy matter for a hostile party to\r\npenetrate into the village, for the men were habituated to the use of\r\nbows and fire-arms, and the towers being generally so placed, that the\r\ndischarge from one crossed that of another, it was impossible to assault\r\nany of them individually.\r\n\r\nThe interior of these houses was usually sufficiently wretched, for it\r\nwould have been folly to have furnished them in a manner which could\r\nexcite the avarice of their lawless neighbours. Yet the families\r\nthemselves exhibited in their appearance a degree of comfort,\r\ninformation, and independence, which could hardly have been expected.\r\nTheir in-field supplied them with bread and home-brewed ale, their herds\r\nand flocks with beef and mutton (the extravagance of killing lambs or\r\ncalves was never thought of). Each family killed a mart, or fat bullock,\r\nin November, which was salted up for winter use, to which the good wife\r\ncould, upon great occasions, add a dish of pigeons or a fat capon,--the\r\nill-cultivated garden afforded "lang-cale,"--and the river gave salmon\r\nto serve as a relish during the season of Lent.\r\n\r\nOf fuel they had plenty, for the bogs afforded turf; and the remains\r\nof the abused woods continued to give them logs for burning, as well as\r\ntimber for the usual domestic purposes. In addition to these comforts,\r\nthe good-man would now and then sally forth to the greenwood, and mark\r\ndown a buck of season with his gun or his cross-bow; and the Father\r\nConfessor seldom refused him absolution for the trespass, if duly\r\ninvited to take his share of the smoking haunch. Some, still bolder,\r\nmade, either with their own domestics, or by associating themselves with\r\nthe moss-troopers, in the language of shepherds, "a start and overloup;"\r\nand the golden ornaments and silken head-gear--worn by the females of\r\none or two families of note, were invidiously traced by their neighbours\r\nto such successful excursions. This, however, was a more inexplicable\r\ncrime in the eyes of the Abbot and Community of Saint Mary\'s, than\r\nthe borrowing one of the "gude king\'s deer;" and they failed not to\r\ndiscountenance and punish, by every means in their power, offences which\r\nwere sure to lead to severe retaliation upon the property of the church,\r\nand which tended to alter the character of their peaceful vassalage.\r\n\r\nAs for the information possessed by those dependents of the Abbacies,\r\nthey might have been truly said to be better fed than taught, even\r\nthough their fare had been worse than it was. Still, however, they\r\nenjoyed opportunities of knowledge from which others were excluded. The\r\nmonks were in general well acquainted with their vassals and tenants,\r\nand familiar in the families of the better class among them, where they\r\nwere sure to be received with the respect due to their twofold character\r\nof spiritual father and secular landlord. Thus it often happened, when\r\na boy displayed talents and inclination for study, one of the brethren,\r\nwith a view to his being bred to the church, or out of good-nature,\r\nin order to pass away his own idle time, if he had no better motive,\r\ninitiated him into the mysteries of reading and writing, and imparted to\r\nhim such other knowledge as he himself possessed. And the heads of these\r\nallied families, having more time for reflection, and more skill, as\r\nwell as stronger motives for improving their small properties, bore\r\namongst their neighbours the character of shrewd, intelligent men, who\r\nclaimed respect on account of their comparative wealth, even while they\r\nwere despised for a less warlike and enterprising turn than the other\r\nBorderers. They lived as much as they well could amongst themselves,\r\navoiding the company of others, and dreading nothing more than to be\r\ninvolved in the deadly feuds and ceaseless contentions of the secular\r\nlandholders.\r\n\r\nSuch is a general picture of these communities. During the fatal wars in\r\nthe commencement of Queen Mary\'s reign, they had suffered dreadfully by\r\nthe hostile invasions. For the English, now a Protestant people, were\r\nso far from sparing the church-lands, that they forayed them with more\r\nunrelenting severity than even the possessions of the laity. But\r\nthe peace of 1550 had restored some degree of tranquillity to those\r\ndistracted and harassed regions, and matters began again gradually\r\nto settle upon the former footing. The monks repaired their ravaged\r\nshrines--the feuar again roofed his small fortalice which the enemy had\r\nruined--the poor labourer rebuilt his cottage--an easy task, where a few\r\nsods, stones, and some pieces of wood from the next copse, furnished\r\nall the materials necessary. The cattle, lastly, were driven out of the\r\nwastes and thickets in which the remnant of them had been secreted; and\r\nthe mighty bull moved at the head of his seraglio and their followers,\r\nto take possession of their wonted pastures. There ensued peace and\r\nquiet, the state of the age and nation considered, to the Monastery of\r\nSaint Mary, and its dependencies, for several tranquil years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter the Second.\r\n\r\n\r\n  In yon lone vale his early youth was bred,\r\n  Not solitary then--the bugle-horn\r\n  Of fell Alecto often waked its windings,\r\n  From where the brook joins the majestic river,\r\n  To the wild northern bog, the curlew\'s haunt,\r\n  Where oozes forth its first and feeble streamlet.\r\n                                           OLD PLAY.\r\n\r\nWe have said, that most of the feuars dwelt in the village belonging to\r\ntheir townships. This was not, however, universally the case. A lonely\r\ntower, to which the reader must now be introduced, was at least one\r\nexception to the general rule.\r\n\r\nIt was of small dimensions, yet larger than those which occurred in the\r\nvillage, as intimating that, in case of assault, the proprietor would\r\nhave to rely upon his own unassisted strength. Two or three miserable\r\nhuts, at the foot of the fortalice, held the bondsmen and tenants of the\r\nfeuar. The site was a beautiful green knoll, which started up suddenly\r\nin the very throat of a wild and narrow glen, and which, being\r\nsurrounded, except on one side, by the winding of a small stream,\r\nafforded a position of considerable strength.\r\n\r\nBut the great security of Glendearg, for so the place was called, lay\r\nin its secluded, and almost hidden situation. To reach the tower, it was\r\nnecessary to travel three miles up the glen, crossing about twenty times\r\nthe little stream, which, winding through the narrow valley, encountered\r\nat every hundred yards the opposition of a rock or precipitous bank on\r\nthe one side, which altered its course, and caused it to shoot off in an\r\noblique direction to the other. The hills which ascend on each side of\r\nthis glen are very steep, and rise boldly over the stream, which is\r\nthus imprisoned within their barriers. The sides of the glen are\r\nimpracticable for horse, and are only to be traversed by means of\r\nthe sheep-paths which lie along their sides. It would not be readily\r\nsupposed that a road so hopeless and so difficult could lead to any\r\nhabitation more important than the summer shealing of a shepherd.\r\n\r\nYet the glen, though lonely, nearly inaccessible, and sterile, was not\r\nthen absolutely void of beauty. The turf which covered the small portion\r\nof level ground on the sides of the stream, was as close and verdant as\r\nif it had occupied the scythes of a hundred gardeners once a-fortnight;\r\nand it was garnished with an embroidery of daisies and wild flowers,\r\nwhich the scythes would certainly have destroyed. The little brook, now\r\nconfined betwixt closer limits, now left at large to choose its course\r\nthrough the narrow valley, danced carelessly on from stream to pool,\r\nlight and unturbid, as that better class of spirits who pass their way\r\nthrough life, yielding to insurmountable obstacles, but as far from\r\nbeing subdued by them as the sailor who meets by chance with an\r\nunfavourable wind, and shapes his course so as to be driven back as\r\nlittle as possible.\r\n\r\nThe mountains, as they would have been called in England, _Scottice_ the\r\nsteep _braes_, rose abruptly over the little glen, here presenting\r\nthe gray face of a rock, from which the turf had been peeled by the\r\ntorrents, and there displaying patches of wood and copse, which had\r\nescaped the waste of the cattle and the sheep of the feuars, and which,\r\nfeathering naturally up the beds of empty torrents, or occupying the\r\nconcave recesses of the bank, gave at once beauty and variety to the\r\nlandscape. Above these scattered woods rose the hill, in barren, but\r\npurple majesty; the dark rich hue, particularly in autumn, contrasting\r\nbeautifully with the thickets of oak and birch, the mountain ashes and\r\nthorns, the alders and quivering aspens, which checquered and varied\r\nthe descent, and not less with the dark-green and velvet turf, which\r\ncomposed the level part of the narrow glen.\r\n\r\nYet, though thus embellished, the scene could neither be strictly termed\r\nsublime nor beautiful, and scarcely even picturesque or striking. But\r\nits extreme solitude pressed on the heart; the traveller felt that\r\nuncertainty whither he was going, or in what so wild a path was to\r\nterminate, which, at times, strikes more on the imagination than the\r\ngrand features of a show-scene, when you know the exact distance of the\r\ninn where your dinner is bespoke, and at the moment preparing. These\r\nare ideas, however, of a far later age; for at the time we treat of,\r\nthe picturesque, the beautiful, the sublime, and all their intermediate\r\nshades, were ideas absolutely unknown to the inhabitants and occasional\r\nvisitors of Glendearg.\r\n\r\nThese had, however, attached to the scene feelings fitting the time. Its\r\nname, signifying the Red Valley, seems to have been derived, not only\r\nfrom the purple colour of the heath, with which the upper part of the\r\nrising banks was profusely clothed, but also from the dark red colour of\r\nthe rocks, and of the precipitous earthen banks, which in that country\r\nare called _scaurs_. Another glen, about the head of Ettrick, has\r\nacquired the same name from similar circumstances; and there are\r\nprobably more in Scotland to which it has been given.\r\n\r\nAs our Glendearg did not abound in mortal visitants, superstition, that\r\nit might not be absolutely destitute of inhabitants, had peopled\r\nits recesses with beings belonging to another world. The savage and\r\ncapricious Brown Man of the Moors, a being which seems the genuine\r\ndescendant of the northern dwarfs, was supposed to be seen there\r\nfrequently, especially after the autumnal equinox, when the fogs were\r\nthick, and objects not easily distinguished. The Scottish fairies, too,\r\na whimsical, irritable, and mischievous tribe, who, though at times\r\ncapriciously benevolent, were more frequently adverse to mortals, were\r\nalso supposed to have formed a residence in a particularly wild\r\nrecess of the glen, of which the real name was, in allusion to that\r\ncircumstance, _Corrie nan Shian_, which, in corrupted Celtic, signifies\r\nthe Hollow of the Fairies. But the neighbours were more cautious in\r\nspeaking about this place, and avoided giving it a name, from an idea\r\ncommon then throughout all the British and Celtic provinces of Scotland,\r\nand still retained in many places, that to speak either good or ill\r\nof this capricious race of imaginary beings, is to provoke their\r\nresentment, and that secrecy and silence is what they chiefly desire\r\nfrom those who may intrude upon their revels, or discover their haunts.\r\n\r\nA mysterious terror was thus attached to the dale, which afforded\r\naccess from the broad valley of the Tweed, up the little glen we have\r\ndescribed, to the fortalice called the Tower of Glendearg. Beyond the\r\nknoll, where, as we have said, the tower was situated, the hills grew\r\nmore steep, and narrowed on the slender brook, so as scarce to leave\r\na footpath; and there the glen terminated in a wild waterfall, where a\r\nslender thread of water dashed in a precipitous line of foam over two\r\nor three precipices. Yet farther in the same direction, and above these\r\nsuccessive cataracts, lay a wild and extensive morass, frequented only\r\nby waterfowl, wide, waste, apparently almost interminable, and serving\r\nin a great measure to separate the inhabitants of the glen from those\r\nwho lived to the northward.\r\n\r\nTo restless and indefatigable moss-troopers, indeed, these morasses were\r\nwell known, and sometimes afforded a retreat. They often rode down the\r\nglen--called at this tower--asked and received hospitality--but still\r\nwith a sort of reserve on the part of its more peaceful inhabitants, who\r\nentertained them as a party of North-American Indians might be received\r\nby a new European settler, as much out of fear as hospitality, while\r\nthe uppermost wish of the landlord is the speedy departure of the savage\r\nguests.\r\n\r\nThis had not always been the current of feeling in the little valley\r\nand its tower. Simon Glendinning, its former inhabitant, boasted his\r\nconnexion by blood to that ancient family of Glendonwyne, on the western\r\nborder. He used to narrate, at his fireside, in the autumn evenings, the\r\nfeats of the family to which he belonged, one of whom fell by the side\r\nof the brave Earl of Douglas at Otterbourne. On these occasions Simon\r\nusually held upon his knee an ancient broadsword, which had belonged to\r\nhis ancestors before any of the family had consented to accept a fief\r\nunder the peaceful dominion of the monks of St. Mary\'s. In modern days,\r\nSimon might have lived at ease on his own estate, and quietly murmured\r\nagainst the fate that had doomed him to dwell there, and cut off his\r\naccess to martial renown. But so many opportunities, nay so many calls\r\nthere were for him, who in those days spoke big, to make good his words\r\nby his actions, that Simon Glendinning was soon under the necessity of\r\nmarching with the men of the Halidome, as it was called, of St. Mary\'s,\r\nin that disastrous campaign which was concluded by the battle of Pinkie.\r\n\r\nThe Catholic clergy were deeply interested in that national quarrel, the\r\nprincipal object of which was, to prevent the union of the infant Queen\r\nMary, with the son of the heretical Henry VIII. The Monks had called out\r\ntheir vassals, under an experienced leader. Many of themselves had taken\r\narms, and marched to the field, under a banner representing a female,\r\nsupposed to personify the Scottish Church, kneeling in the attitude of\r\nprayer, with the legend, _Afflictae Sponsae ne obliviscaris_. [Footnote:\r\nForget not the afflicted spouse.]\r\n\r\nThe Scots, however, in all their wars, had more occasion for good\r\nand cautious generals, than for excitation, whether political or\r\nenthusiastic. Their headlong and impatient courage uniformly induced\r\nthem to rush into action without duly weighing either their own\r\nsituation, or that of their enemies, and the inevitable consequence was\r\nfrequent defeat. With the dolorous slaughter of Pinkie we have nothing\r\nto do, excepting that, among ten thousand men of low and high degree,\r\nSimon Glendinning, of the Tower of Glendearg, bit the dust, no way\r\ndisparaging in his death that ancient race from which he claimed his\r\ndescent.\r\n\r\nWhen the doleful news, which spread terror and mourning through the\r\nwhole of Scotland, reached the Tower of Glendearg, the widow of\r\nSimon, Elspeth Brydone by her family name, was alone in that desolate\r\nhabitation, excepting a hind or two, alike past martial and agricultural\r\nlabour, and the helpless widows and families of those who had fallen\r\nwith their master. The feeling of desolation was universal;--but what\r\navailed it? The monks, their patrons and protectors, were driven from\r\ntheir Abbey by the English forces, who now overran the country, and\r\nenforced at least an appearance of submission on the part of the\r\ninhabitants. The Protector, Somerset, formed a strong camp among the\r\nruins of the ancient Castle of Roxburgh, and compelled the neighbouring\r\ncountry to come in, pay tribute, and take assurance from him, as the\r\nphrase then went. Indeed, there was no power of resistance remaining;\r\nand the few barons, whose high spirit disdained even the appearance\r\nof surrender, could only retreat into the wildest fastnesses of the\r\ncountry, leaving their houses and property to the wrath of the English,\r\nwho detached parties everywhere to distress, by military exaction, those\r\nwhose chiefs had not made their submission. The Abbot and his community\r\nhaving retreated beyond the Forth, their lands were severely forayed,\r\nas their sentiments were held peculiarly inimical to the alliance with\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nAmongst the troops detached on this service was a small party, commanded\r\nby Stawarth Bolton, a captain in the English army, and full of the\r\nblunt and unpretending gallantry and generosity which has so often\r\ndistinguished that nation. Resistance was in vain. Elspeth Brydone, when\r\nshe descried a dozen of horsemen threading their way up the glen, with\r\na man at their head, whose scarlet cloak, bright armour, and dancing\r\nplume, proclaimed him a leader, saw no better protection for herself\r\nthan to issue from the iron grate, covered with a long mourning\r\nveil, and holding one of her two sons in each hand, to meet the\r\nEnglishman--state her deserted condition--place the little tower at his\r\ncommand--and beg for his mercy. She stated, in a few brief words,\r\nher intention, and added, "I submit, because I have nae means of\r\nresistance."\r\n\r\n"And I do not ask your submission, mistress, for the same reason,"\r\nreplied the Englishman. "To be satisfied of your peaceful intentions\r\nis all I ask; and, from what you tell me, there is no reason to doubt\r\nthem."\r\n\r\n"At least, sir," said Elspeth Brydone, "take share of what our\r\nspence and our garners afford. Your horses are tired--your folk want\r\nrefreshment."\r\n\r\n"Not a whit--not a whit," answered the honest Englishman; "it shall\r\nnever be said we disturbed by carousal the widow of a brave soldier,\r\nwhile she was mourning for her husband.--Comrades, face about.--Yet\r\nstay," he added, checking his war-horse, "my parties are out in every\r\ndirection; they must have some token that your family are under my\r\nassurance of safety.--Here, my little fellow," said he, speaking to\r\nthe eldest boy, who might be about nine or ten years old, "lend me thy\r\nbonnet."\r\n\r\nThe child reddened, looked sulky, and hesitated, while the mother,\r\nwith many a _fye_ and _nay pshaw_, and such sarsenet chidings as tender\r\nmothers give to spoiled children, at length succeeded in snatching the\r\nbonnet from him, and handing it to the English leader.\r\n\r\nStawarth Bolton took his embroidered red cross from his barret-cap, and\r\nputting it into the loop of the boy\'s bonnet, said to the mistress, (for\r\nthe title of lady was not given to dames of her degree,) "By this token,\r\nwhich all my people will respect, you will be freed from any importunity\r\non the part of our forayers." [Footnote: As gallantry of all times and\r\nnations has the same mode of thinking and acting, so it often expresses\r\nitself by the same symbols. In the civil war 1745-6, a party of\r\nHighlanders, under a Chieftain of rank, came to Rose Castle, the seat of\r\nthe Bishop of Carlisle, but then occupied by the family of Squire Dacre\r\nof Cumberland. They demanded quarters, which of course were not to be\r\nrefused to armed men of a strange attire and unknown language. But the\r\ndomestic represented to the captain of the mountaineers, that the lady\r\nof the mansion had been just delivered of a daughter, and expressed her\r\nhope, that, under these circumstances, his party would give as little\r\ntrouble as possible. "God forbid," said the gallant chief, "that I or\r\nmine should be the means of adding to a lady\'s inconvenience at such a\r\ntime. May I request to see the infant?" The child was brought, and the\r\nHighlander, taking his cockade out of his bonnet, and pinning it on the\r\nchild\'s breast, "That will be a token," he said, "to any of our people\r\nwho may come hither, that Donald McDonald of Kinloch-Moidart, has taken\r\nthe family of Rose Castle under his protection." The lady who received\r\nin infancy this gage of Highland protection, is now Mary, Lady Clerk\r\nof Pennycuik; and on the 10th of June still wears the cockade which was\r\npinned on her breast, with a white rose as a kindred decoration.] He\r\nplaced it on the boy\'s head; but it was no sooner there, than the little\r\nfellow, his veins swelling, and his eyes shooting fire through tears,\r\nsnatched the bonnet from his head, and, ere his mother could interfere,\r\nskimmed it into the brook. The other boy ran instantly to fish it out\r\nagain, threw it back to his brother, first taking out the cross, which,\r\nwith great veneration, he kissed and put into his bosom. The Englishman\r\nwas half diverted, half surprised, with the scene.\r\n\r\n"What mean ye by throwing away Saint George\'s red cross?" said he to the\r\nelder boy, in a tone betwixt jest and earnest.\r\n\r\n"Because Saint George is a southern saint," said the child, sulkily.\r\n"Good"--said Stawarth Bolton.--"And what did you mean by taking it\r\nout of the brook again, my little fellow?" he demanded of the younger.\r\n"Because the priest says it is the common sign of salvation to all good\r\nChristians."\r\n\r\n"Why, good again!" said the honest soldier. "I protest unto you,\r\nmistress, I envy you these boys. Are they both yours?"\r\n\r\nStawarth Bolton had reason to put the question, for Halbert Glendinning,\r\nthe elder of the two, had hair as dark as the raven\'s plumage, black\r\neyes, large, bold, and sparkling, that glittered under eyebrows of the\r\nsame complexion; a skin deep embrowned, though it could not be termed\r\nswarthy, and an air of activity, frankness, and determination, far\r\nbeyond his age. On the other hand, Edward, the younger brother, was\r\nlight-haired, blue-eyed, and of fairer complexion, in countenance rather\r\npale, and not exhibiting that rosy hue which colours the sanguine cheek\r\nof robust health. Yet the boy had nothing sickly or ill-conditioned in\r\nhis look, but was, on the contrary, a fair and handsome child, with a\r\nsmiling face, and mild, yet cheerful eye.\r\n\r\nThe mother glanced a proud motherly glance, first at the one, and then\r\nat the other, ere she answered the Englishman, "Surely, sir, they are\r\nboth my children."\r\n\r\n"And by the same father, mistress?" said Stawarth; but, seeing a blush\r\nof displeasure arise on her brow, he instantly added, "Nay, I mean no\r\noffence; I would have asked the same question at any of my gossips in\r\nmerry Lincoln.--Well, dame, you have two fair boys; I would I could\r\nborrow one, for Dame Bolton and I live childless in our old hall.--Come,\r\nlittle fellows, which of you will go with me?"\r\n\r\nThe trembling mother, half-fearing as he spoke, drew the children\r\ntowards her, one with either hand, while they both answered the\r\nstranger. "I will not go with you," said Halbert, boldly, "for you are\r\na false-hearted Southern; and the Southerns killed my father; and I will\r\nwar on you to the death, when I can draw my father\'s sword."\r\n\r\n"God-a-mercy, my little levin-bolt," said Stawarth, "the goodly custom\r\nof deadly feud will never go down in thy day, I presume.--And you, my\r\nfine white-head, will you not go with me, to ride a cock-horse?" "No,"\r\nsaid Edward, demurely, "for you are a heretic."\r\n\r\n"Why, God-a-mercy still!" said Stawarth Bolton. "Well, dame, I see I\r\nshall find no recruits for my troop from you; and yet I do envy you\r\nthese two little chubby knaves." He sighed a moment, as was visible,\r\nin spite of gorget and corslet, and then added, "And yet, my dame and I\r\nwould but quarrel which of the knaves we should like best; for I\r\nshould wish for the black-eyed rogue--and she, I warrant me, for that\r\nblue-eyed, fair-haired darling. Natheless, we must brook our solitary\r\nwedlock, and wish joy to those that are more fortunate. Sergeant\r\nBrittson, do thou remain here till recalled--protect this family, as\r\nunder assurance--do them no wrong, and suffer no wrong to be done to\r\nthem, as thou wilt answer it.--Dame, Brittson is a married man, old and\r\nsteady; feed him on what you will, but give him not over much liquor."\r\n\r\nDame Glendinning again offered refreshments, but with a faltering voice,\r\nand an obvious desire her invitation should not be accepted. The fact\r\nwas, that, supposing her boys as precious in the eyes of the Englishman\r\nas in her own, (the most ordinary of parental errors,) she was half\r\nafraid, that the admiration he expressed of them in his blunt manner\r\nmight end in his actually carrying off one or other of the little\r\ndarlings whom he appeared to covet so much. She kept hold of their\r\nhands, therefore, as if her feeble strength could have been of service,\r\nhad any violence been intended, and saw with joy she could not disguise,\r\nthe little party of horse countermarch, in order to descend the glen.\r\nHer feelings did not escape Bolton: "I forgive you, dame," he said, "for\r\nbeing suspicious that an English falcon was hovering over your Scottish\r\nmoor-brood. But fear not--those who have fewest children have fewest\r\ncares; nor does a wise man covet those of another household. Adieu,\r\ndame; when the black-eyed rogue is able to drive a foray from England,\r\nteach him to spare women and children, for the sake of Stawarth Bolton."\r\n\r\n"God be with you, gallant Southern!" said Elspeth Glendinning, but not\r\ntill he was out of hearing, spurring on his good horse to regain the\r\nhead of his party, whose plumage and armour were now glancing and\r\ngradually disappearing in the distance, as they winded down the glen.\r\n\r\n"Mother," said the elder boy, "I will not say amen to a prayer for a\r\nSouthern."\r\n\r\n"Mother," said the younger, more reverentially, "is it right to pray for\r\na heretic?"\r\n\r\n"The God to whom I pray only knows," answered poor Elspeth; "but these\r\ntwo words, Southern and heretic, have already cost Scotland ten thousand\r\nof her best and bravest, and me a husband, and you a father; and,\r\nwhether blessing or banning, I never wish to hear them more.--Follow me\r\nto the Place, sir," she said to Brittson, "and such as we have to offer\r\nyou shall be at your disposal."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter the Third.\r\n\r\n\r\n  They lighted down on Tweed water\r\n    And blew their coals sae het,\r\n  And fired the March and Teviotdale,\r\n     All in an evening late.\r\n                       AULD MAITLAND.\r\n\r\nThe report soon spread through the patrimony of Saint Mary\'s and its\r\nvicinity, that the Mistress of Glendearg had received assurance from the\r\nEnglish Captain, and that her cattle were not to be driven off, or her\r\ncorn burned. Among others who heard this report, it reached the ears of\r\na lady, who, once much higher in rank than Elspeth Glendinning, was now\r\nby the same calamity reduced to even greater misfortune.\r\n\r\nShe was the widow of a brave soldier, Walter Avenel, descended of a very\r\nancient Border family, who once possessed immense estates in Eskdale.\r\nThese had long since passed from them into other hands, but they still\r\nenjoyed an ancient Barony of considerable extent, not very far from the\r\npatrimony of Saint Mary\'s, and lying upon the same side of the river\r\nwith the narrow vale of Glendearg, at the head of which was the little\r\ntower of the Glendinnings. Here they had lived, bearing a respectable\r\nrank amongst the gentry of their province, though neither wealthy nor\r\npowerful. This general regard had been much augmented by the skill,\r\ncourage, and enterprise which had been displayed by Walter Avenel, the\r\nlast Baron.\r\n\r\nWhen Scotland began to recover from the dreadful shock she had sustained\r\nafter the battle of Pinkie-Cleuch, Avenel was one of the first who,\r\nassembling a small force, set an example in those bloody and unsparing\r\nskirmishes, which showed that a nation, though conquered and overrun by\r\ninvaders, may yet wage against them such a war of detail as shall in\r\nthe end become fatal to the foreigners. In one of these, however, Walter\r\nAvenel fell, and the news which came to the house of his fathers was\r\nfollowed by the distracting intelligence, that a party of Englishmen\r\nwere coming to plunder the mansion and lands of his widow, in order, by\r\nthis act of terror, to prevent others from following the example of the\r\ndeceased.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate lady had no better refuge than the miserable cottage\r\nof a shepherd among the hills, to which she was hastily removed, scarce\r\nconscious where or for what purpose her terrified attendants were\r\nremoving her and her infant daughter from her own house. Here she was\r\ntended with all the duteous service of ancient times by the shepherd\'s\r\nwife, Tibb Tacket, who in better days had been her own bowerwoman. For a\r\ntime the lady was unconscious of her misery; but when the first stunning\r\neffect of grief was so far passed away that she could form an estimate\r\nof her own situation, the widow of Avenel had cause to envy the lot of\r\nher husband in his dark and silent abode. The domestics who had guided\r\nher to her place of refuge, were presently obliged to disperse for their\r\nown safety, or to seek for necessary subsistence; and the shepherd and\r\nhis wife, whose poor cottage she shared, were soon after deprived of the\r\nmeans of affording their late mistress even that coarse sustenance\r\nwhich they had gladly shared with her. Some of the English forayers\r\nhad discovered and driven off the few sheep which had escaped the first\r\nresearches of their avarice. Two cows shared the fate of the remnant of\r\ntheir stock; they had afforded the family almost their sole support, and\r\nnow famine appeared to stare them in the face.\r\n\r\n"We are broken and beggared now, out and out," said old Martin the\r\nshepherd--and he wrung his hands in the bitterness of agony, "the\r\nthieves, the harrying thieves I not a cloot left of the haill hirsel!"\r\n\r\n"And to see poor Grizzle and Crumbie," said his wife, "turning back\r\ntheir necks to the byre, and routing while the stony-hearted villains\r\nwere brogging them on wi\' their lances!"\r\n\r\n"There were but four of them," said Martin, "and I have seen the day\r\nforty wad not have ventured this length. But our strength and manhood is\r\ngane with our puir maister."\r\n\r\n"For the sake of the holy rood, whisht, man," said the goodwife, "our\r\nleddy is half gane already, as ye may see by that fleightering of the\r\nee-lid--a word mair and she\'s dead outright."\r\n\r\n"I could almost wish," said Martin, "we were a\' gane, for what to do\r\npasses my puir wit. I care little for mysell, or you, Tibb,--we can make\r\na fend--work or want--we can do baith, but she can do neither."\r\n\r\nThey canvassed their situation thus openly before the lady, convinced by\r\nthe paleness of her look, her quivering lip, and dead-set eye, that she\r\nneither heard nor understood what they were saying.\r\n\r\n"There is a way," said the shepherd, "but I kenna if she could bring her\r\nheart to it,--there\'s Simon Glendinning\'s widow of the glen yonder, has\r\nhad assurance from the Southern loons, and nae soldier to steer them\r\nfor one cause or other. Now, if the leddy could bow her mind to take\r\nquarters with Elspeth Glendinning till better days cast up, nae doubt it\r\nwad be doing an honour to the like of her, but----"\r\n\r\n"An honour," answered Tibb, "ay, by my word, sic an honour as wad be\r\npride to her kin mony a lang year after her banes were in the mould. Oh!\r\ngudeman, to hear ye even the Lady of Avenel to seeking quarters wi\' a\r\nKirk-vassal\'s widow!"\r\n\r\n"Loath should I be to wish her to it," said Martin; "but what may we\r\ndo?--to stay here is mere starvation; and where to go, I\'m sure I ken\r\nnae mair than ony tup I ever herded."\r\n\r\n"Speak no more of it," said the widow of Avenel, suddenly joining in the\r\nconversation, "I will go to the tower.--Dame Elspeth is of good folk,\r\na widow, and the mother of orphans,--she will give us house-room until\r\nsomething be thought upon. These evil showers make the low bush better\r\nthan no bield."\r\n\r\n"See there, see there," said Martin, "you see the leddy has twice our\r\nsense."\r\n\r\n"And natural it is," said Tibb, "seeing that she is convent-bred, and\r\ncan lay silk broidery, forby white-seam and shell-work."\r\n\r\n"Do you not think," said the lady to Martin, still clasping her child to\r\nher bosom and making it clear from what motives she desired the refuge,\r\n"that Dame Glendinning will make us welcome?"\r\n\r\n"Blithely welcome, blithely welcome, my leddy," answered Martin,\r\ncheerily, "and we shall deserve a welcome at her hand. Men are scarce\r\nnow, my leddy, with these wars; and gie me a thought of time to it, I\r\ncan do as good a day\'s darg as ever I did in my life, and Tibb can sort\r\ncows with ony living woman."\r\n\r\n"And muckle mair could I do," said Tibb, "were it ony feasible house;\r\nbut there will be neither pearlins to mend, nor pinners to busk up, in\r\nElspeth Glendinning\'s."\r\n\r\n"Whisht wi\' your pride, woman," said the shepherd; "eneugh you can do,\r\nbaith outside and inside, an ye set your mind to it; and hard it is\r\nif we twa canna work for three folk\'s meat, forby my dainty wee leddy\r\nthere. Come awa, come awa, nae use in staying here langer; we have five\r\nScots miles over moss and muir, and that is nae easy walk for a leddy\r\nborn and bred."\r\n\r\nHousehold stuff there was little or none to remove or care for; an\r\nold pony which had escaped the plunderers, owing partly to its pitiful\r\nappearance, partly from the reluctance which it showed to be caught\r\nby strangers, was employed to carry the few blankets and other trifles\r\nwhich they possessed. When Shagram came to his master\'s well-known\r\nwhistle, he was surprised to find the poor thing had been wounded,\r\nthough slightly, by an arrow, which one of the forayers had shot off in\r\nanger after he had long chased it in vain.\r\n\r\n"Ay, Shagram," said the old man, as he applied something to the wound,\r\n"must you rue the lang-bow as weel as all of us?"\r\n\r\n"What corner in Scotland rues it not!" said the Lady of Avenel.\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay, madam," said Martin, "God keep the kindly Scot from the\r\ncloth-yard shaft, and he will keep himself from the handy stroke. But\r\nlet us go our way; the trash that is left I can come back for. There is\r\nnae ane to stir it but the good neighbours, and they----"\r\n\r\n"For the love of God, goodman," said his wife, in a remonstrating tone,\r\n"haud your peace! Think what ye\'re saying, and we hae sae muckle wild\r\nland to go over before we win to the girth gate."\r\n\r\nThe husband nodded acquiescence; for it was deemed highly imprudent to\r\nspeak of the fairies, either by their title of _good neighbours_ or\r\nby any other, especially when about to pass the places which they were\r\nsupposed to haunt.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: This superstition continues to prevail, though one would\r\nsuppose it must now be antiquated. It is only a year or two since an\r\nitinerant puppet show-man, who, disdaining to acknowledge the profession\r\nof Gines de Passamonte, called himself an artist from Vauxhall, brought\r\na complaint of a singular nature before the author, as Sheriff of\r\nSelkirkshire. The singular dexterity with which the show-man had\r\nexhibited the machinery of his little stage, had, upon a Selkirk\r\nfair-day, excited the eager curiosity of some mechanics of Galashiels.\r\nThese men, from no worse motive that could be discovered than a thirst\r\nafter knowledge beyond their sphere, committed a burglary upon the barn\r\nin which the puppets had been consigned to repose, and carried them off\r\nin the nook of their plaids, when returning from Selkirk to their own\r\nvillage.\r\n\r\n  "But with the morning cool reflection came."\r\n\r\nThe party found, however, they could not make Punch dance, and that\r\nthe whole troop were equally intractable; they had also, perhaps, some\r\napprehensions of the Rhadamanth of the district; and, willing to be quit\r\nof their booty, they left the puppets seated in a grove by the side of\r\nthe Ettrick, where they were sure to be touched by the first beams of\r\nthe rising sun. Here a shepherd, who was on foot with sunrise to pen\r\nhis master\'s sheep on a field of turnips, to his utter astonishment, saw\r\nthis train, profusely gay, sitting in the little grotto. His examination\r\nproceeded thus:--\r\n\r\n_Sheriff_. You saw these gay-looking things? what did you think they\r\nwere?\r\n\r\n_Shepherd_. Ou, I am no that free to say what I might think they were.\r\n\r\n_Sheriff_. Come, lad, I must have a direct answer--who did you think\r\nthey were?\r\n\r\n_Shepherd_. Ou, sir, troth I am no that free to say that I mind wha I\r\nmight think they were.\r\n\r\n_Sheriff_. Come, come sir! I ask you distinctly, did you think they were\r\nthe fairies you saw?\r\n\r\n_Shepherd_. Indeed, sir, and I winna say but I might think it was the\r\nGood Neighbours.\r\n\r\nThus unwillingly was he brought to allude to the irritable and captious\r\ninhabitants of fairy land.]\r\n\r\nThey set forward on their pilgrimage on the last day of October. "This\r\nis thy birthday, my sweet Mary," said the mother, as a sting of bitter\r\nrecollection crossed her mind. "Oh, who could have believed that the\r\nhead, which, a few years since, was cradled amongst so many rejoicing\r\nfriends, may perhaps this night seek a cover in vain!"\r\n\r\nThe exiled family then set forward,--Mary Avenel, a lovely girl between\r\nfive and six years old, riding gipsy fashion upon Shagram, betwixt two\r\nbundles of bedding; the Lady of Avenel walking by the animal\'s side;\r\nTibb leading the bridle, and old Martin walking a little before, looking\r\nanxiously around him to explore the way.\r\n\r\nMartin\'s task as guide, after two or three miles\' walking, became more\r\ndifficult than he himself had expected, or than he was willing to avow.\r\nIt happened that the extensive range of pasturage, with which he was\r\nconversant, lay to the west, and to get into the little valley of\r\nGlendearg he had to proceed easterly. In the wilder districts of\r\nScotland, the passage from one vale to another, otherwise than by\r\ndescending that which you leave, and reascending the other, is often\r\nvery difficult.--Heights and hollows, mosses and rocks intervene, and\r\nall those local impediments which throw a traveller out of his course.\r\nSo that Martin, however sure of his general direction, became conscious,\r\nand at length was forced reluctantly to admit, that he had missed the\r\ndirect road to Glendearg, though he insisted they must be very near it.\r\n"If we can but win across this wide bog," he said, "I shall warrant ye\r\nare on the top of the tower." But to get across the bog was a point\r\nof no small difficulty. The farther they ventured into it, though\r\nproceeding with all the caution which Martin\'s experience recommended,\r\nthe more unsound the ground became, until, after they had passed some\r\nplaces of great peril, their best argument for going forward came to be,\r\nthat they had to encounter equal danger in returning. The Lady of Avenel\r\nhad been tenderly nurtured, but what will not a woman endure when her\r\nchild is in danger? Complaining less of the dangers of the road than\r\nher attendants, who had been inured to such from their infancy, she kept\r\nherself close by the side of the pony, watching its every footstep, and\r\nready, if it should flounder in the morass, to snatch her little Mary\r\nfrom its back. At length they came to a place where the guide greatly\r\nhesitated, for all around him was broken lumps of heath, divided\r\nfrom each other by deep sloughs of black tenacious mire. After great\r\nconsideration, Martin, selecting what he thought the safest path, began\r\nhimself to lead forward Shagram, in order to afford greater security to\r\nthe child. But Shagram snorted, laid his ears back, stretched his two\r\nfeet forward, and drew his hind feet under him, so as to adopt the best\r\npossible posture for obstinate resistance, and refused to move one yard\r\nin the direction indicated. Old Martin, much puzzled, now hesitated\r\nwhether to exert his absolute authority, or to defer to the contumacious\r\nobstinacy of Shagram, and was not greatly comforted by his wife\'s\r\nobservation, who, seeing Shagram stare with his eyes, distend his\r\nnostrils, and tremble with terror, hinted that "he surely saw more than\r\nthey could see."\r\n\r\nIn this dilemma, the child suddenly exclaimed--"Bonny leddy signs to\r\nus to come yon gate." They all looked in the direction where the child\r\npointed, but saw nothing, save a wreath, of rising mist, which fancy\r\nmight form into a human figure; but which afforded to Martin only the\r\nsorrowful conviction, that the danger of their situation was about to be\r\nincreased by a heavy fog. He once more essayed to lead forward Shagram;\r\nbut the animal was inflexible in its determination not to move in the\r\ndirection Martin recommended. "Take your awn way for it, then," said\r\nMartin, "and let us see what you can do for us."\r\n\r\nShagram, abandoned to the discretion of his own free-will, set off\r\nboldly in the direction the child had pointed. There was nothing\r\nwonderful in this, nor in its bringing them safe to the other side of\r\nthe dangerous morass; for the instinct of these animals in traversing\r\nbogs is one of the most curious parts of their nature, and is a fact\r\ngenerally established. But it was remarkable, that the child more than\r\nonce mentioned the beautiful lady and her signals, and that Shagram\r\nseemed to be in the secret, always moving in the same direction which\r\nshe indicated. The Lady of Avenel took little notice at the time, her\r\nmind being probably occupied by the instant danger; but her attendants\r\nchanged expressive looks with each other more than once.\r\n\r\n"All-Hallow Eve!" said Tibb, in a whisper to Martin.\r\n\r\n"For the mercy of Our Lady, not a word of that now!" said Martin in\r\nreply. "Tell your beads, woman, if you cannot be silent."\r\n\r\nWhen they got once more on firm ground, Martin recognized certain\r\nland-marks, or cairns, on the tops of the neighbouring hills, by which\r\nhe was enabled to guide his course, and ere long they arrived at the\r\nTower of Glendearg.\r\n\r\nIt was at the sight of this little fortalice that the misery of her lot\r\npressed hard on the poor Lady of Avenel. When by any accident they had\r\nmet at church, market, or other place of public resort, she remembered\r\nthe distant and respectful air with which the wife of the warlike baron\r\nwas addressed by the spouse of the humble feuar. And now, so much was\r\nher pride humbled, that she was to ask to share the precarious safety of\r\nthe same feuar\'s widow, and her pittance of food, which might perhaps\r\nbe yet more precarious. Martin probably guessed what was passing in her\r\nmind, for he looked at her with a wistful glance, as if to deprecate any\r\nchange of resolution; and answering to his looks, rather than his words,\r\nshe said, while the sparkle of subdued pride once more glanced from\r\nher eye, "If it were for myself alone, I could but die-but for this\r\ninfant--the last pledge of Avenel--"\r\n\r\n"True, my lady," said Martin, hastily; and, as if to prevent the\r\npossibility of her retracting, he added, "I will step on and see Dame\r\nElspeth--I kend her husband weel, and have bought and sold with him, for\r\nas great a man as he was."\r\n\r\nMartin\'s tale was soon told, and met all acceptance from her companion\r\nin misfortune. The Lady of Avenel had been meek and courteous in her\r\nprosperity; in adversity, therefore, she met with the greatest sympathy.\r\nBesides, there was a point of pride in sheltering and supporting a woman\r\nof such superior birth and rank; and, not to do Elspeth Glendinning\r\ninjustice, she felt sympathy for one whose fate resembled her own in so\r\nmany points, yet was so much more severe. Every species of hospitality\r\nwas gladly and respectfully extended to the distressed travellers,\r\nand they were kindly requested to stay as long at Glendearg as their\r\ncircumstances rendered necessary, or their inclination prompted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter the Fourth.\r\n\r\n\r\n   Ne\'er be I found by thee unawed,\r\n   On that thrice hallow\'d eve abroad.\r\n   When goblins haunt from flood and fen,\r\n                         The steps of men.\r\n                            COLLINS\'S _Ode to Fear_.\r\n\r\nAs the country became more settled, the Lady of Avenel would have\r\nwillingly returned to her husband\'s mansion. But that was no longer in\r\nher power. It was a reign of minority, when the strongest had the best\r\nright, and when acts of usurpation were frequent amongst those who had\r\nmuch power and little conscience.\r\n\r\nJulian Avenel, the younger brother of the deceased Walter, was a person\r\nof this description. He hesitated not to seize upon his brother\'s house\r\nand lands, so soon as the retreat of the English permitted him. At\r\nfirst, he occupied the property in the name of his niece; but when the\r\nlady proposed to return with her child to the mansion of its fathers, he\r\ngave her to understand, that Avenel, being a male fief, descended to\r\nthe brother, instead of the daughter, of the last possessor. The ancient\r\nphilosopher declined a dispute with the emperor who commanded twenty\r\nlegions, and the widow of Walter Avenel was in no condition to maintain\r\na contest with the leader of twenty moss-troopers. Julian was also a\r\nman of service, who could back a friend in case of need, and was sure,\r\ntherefore, to find protectors among the ruling powers. In short, however\r\nclear the little Mary\'s right to the possessions of her father, her\r\nmother saw the necessity of giving way, at least for the time, to the\r\nusurpation of her uncle.\r\n\r\nHer patience and forbearance were so far attended with advantage,\r\nthat Julian, for very shame\'s sake, could no longer suffer her to be\r\nabsolutely dependant on the charity of Elspeth Glendinning. A drove of\r\ncattle and a bull (which were probably missed by some English farmer)\r\nwere driven to the pastures of Glendearg; presents of raiment and\r\nhousehold stuff were sent liberally, and some little money, though with\r\na more sparing hand: for those in the situation of Julian Avenel could\r\ncome more easily by the goods, than the representing medium of value,\r\nand made their payments chiefly in kind.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the widows of Walter Avenel and Simon Glendinning had\r\nbecome habituated to each other\'s society, and were unwilling to part.\r\nThe lady could hope no more secret and secure residence than in the\r\nTower of Glendearg, and she was now in a condition to support her share\r\nof the mutual housekeeping. Elspeth, on the other hand, felt pride, as\r\nwell as pleasure, in the society of a guest of such distinction, and\r\nwas at all times willing to pay much greater deference than the Lady of\r\nWalter Avenel could be prevailed on to accept.\r\n\r\nMartin and his wife diligently served the united family in their several\r\nvocations, and yielded obedience to both mistresses, though always\r\nconsidering themselves as the especial servants of the Lady of Avenel.\r\nThis distinction sometimes occasioned a slight degree of difference\r\nbetween Dame Elspeth and Tibb; the former being jealous of her own\r\nconsequence, and the latter apt to lay too much stress upon the rank\r\nand family of her mistress. But both were alike desirous to conceal such\r\npetty squabbles from the lady, her hostess scarce yielding to her old\r\ndomestic in respect for her person. Neither did the difference exist in\r\nsuch a degree as to interrupt the general harmony of the family, for the\r\none wisely gave way as she saw the other become warm; and Tibb, though\r\nshe often gave the first provocation, had generally the sense to be the\r\nfirst in relinquishing the argument.\r\n\r\nThe world which lay beyond was gradually forgotten by the inhabitants\r\nof this sequestered glen, and unless when she attended mass at the\r\nMonastery Church upon some high holiday, Alice of Avenel almost\r\nforgot that she once held an equal rank with the proud wives of the\r\nneighbouring barons and nobles who on such occasions crowded to the\r\nsolemnity. The recollection gave her little pain. She loved her husband\r\nfor himself, and in his inestimable loss all lesser subjects of regret\r\nhad ceased to interest her. At times, indeed, she thought of claiming\r\nthe protection of the Queen Regent (Mary of Guise) for her little\r\norphan, but the fear of Julian Avenel always came between. She was\r\nsensible that he would have neither scruple nor difficulty in spiriting\r\naway the child, (if he did not proceed farther,) should he once consider\r\nits existence as formidable to his interest. Besides, he led a wild and\r\nunsettled life, mingling in all feuds and forays, wherever there was\r\na spear to be broken; he evinced no purpose of marrying, and the fate\r\nwhich he continually was braving might at length remove him from his\r\nusurped inheritance. Alice of Avenel, therefore, judged it wise to check\r\nall ambitious thoughts for the present, and remain quiet in the rude,\r\nbut peaceable retreat, to which Providence had conducted her.\r\n\r\nIt was upon an All-Hallow\'s eve, when the family had resided together\r\nfor the space of three years, that the domestic circle was assembled\r\nround the blazing turf-fire, in the old narrow hall of the Tower of\r\nGlendearg. The idea of the master or mistress of the mansion feeding or\r\nliving apart from their domestics, was at this period never entertained.\r\nThe highest end of the board, the most commodious settle by the\r\nfire,--these were the only marks of distinction; and the servants\r\nmingled, with deference indeed, but unreproved and with freedom, in\r\nwhatever conversation was going forward. But the two or three domestics,\r\nkept merely for agricultural purposes, had retired to their own cottages\r\nwithout, and with them a couple of wenches, usually employed within\r\ndoors, the daughters of one of the hinds.\r\n\r\nAfter their departure, Martin locked, first, the iron grate; and,\r\nsecondly, the inner door of the tower, when the domestic circle was thus\r\narranged. Dame Elspeth sate pulling the thread from her distaff; Tibb\r\nwatched the progress of scalding the whey, which hung in a large pot\r\nupon the _crook_, a chain terminated by a hook, which was suspended\r\nin the chimney to serve the purpose of the modern crane. Martin, while\r\nbusied in repairing some of the household articles, (for every man in\r\nthose days was his own carpenter and smith, as well as his own tailor\r\nand shoemaker,) kept from time to time a watchful eye upon the three\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nThey were allowed, however, to exercise their juvenile restlessness by\r\nrunning up and down the hall, behind the seats of the elder members of\r\nthe family, with the privilege of occasionally making excursions into\r\none or two small apartments which opened from it, and gave excellent\r\nopportunity to play at hide-and-seek. This night, however, the children\r\nseemed not disposed to avail themselves of their privilege of visiting\r\nthese dark regions, but preferred carrying on their gambols in the\r\nvicinity of the light.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, Alice of Avenel, sitting close to an iron candlestick,\r\nwhich supported a misshapen torch of domestic manufacture, read small\r\ndetached passages from a thick clasped volume, which she preserved\r\nwith the greatest care. The art of reading the lady had acquired by her\r\nresidence in a nunnery during her youth, but she seldom, of late years,\r\nput it to any other use than perusing this little volume, which formed\r\nher whole library. The family listened to the portions which she\r\nselected, as to some good thing which there was a merit in hearing with\r\nrespect, whether it was fully understood or no. To her daughter, Alice\r\nof Avenel had determined to impart their mystery more fully, but the\r\nknowledge was at that period attended with personal danger, and was not\r\nrashly to be trusted to a child.\r\n\r\nThe noise of the romping children interrupted, from time to time, the\r\nvoice of the lady, and drew on the noisy culprits the rebuke of Elspeth.\r\n\r\n"Could they not go farther a-field, if they behoved to make such a din,\r\nand disturb the lady\'s good words?" And this command was backed with\r\nthe threat of sending the whole party to bed if it was not attended to\r\npunctually. Acting under the injunction, the children first played at\r\na greater distance from the party, and more quietly, and then began\r\nto stray into the adjacent apartments, as they became impatient of the\r\nrestraint to which they were subjected. But, all at once, the two boys\r\ncame open-mouthed into the hall, to tell that there was an armed man in\r\nthe spence.\r\n\r\n"It must be Christie of Clint-hill," said Martin, rising; "what can have\r\nbrought him here at this time?"\r\n\r\n"Or how came he in?" said Elspeth.\r\n\r\n"Alas! what can he seek?" said the Lady of Avenel, to whom this man,\r\na retainer of her husband\'s brother, and who sometimes executed his\r\ncommissions at Glendearg, was an object of secret apprehension and\r\nsuspicion. "Gracious heavens!" she added, rising up, "where is my\r\nchild?" All rushed to the spence, Halbert Glendinning first arming\r\nhimself with a rusty sword, and the younger seizing upon the lady\'s\r\nbook. They hastened to the spence, and were relieved of a part of their\r\nanxiety by meeting Mary at the door of the apartment. She did not seem\r\nin the slightest degree alarmed, or disturbed. They rushed into the\r\nspence, (a sort of interior apartment in which the family ate their\r\nvictuals in the summer season,) but there was no one there.\r\n\r\n"Where is Christie of Clint-hill?" said Martin.\r\n\r\n"I do not know," said little Mary; "I never saw him."\r\n\r\n"And what made you, ye misleard loons," said Dame Elspeth to her two\r\nboys, "come yon gate into the ha\', roaring like bullsegs, to frighten\r\nthe leddy, and her far frae strong?" The boys looked at each other in\r\nsilence and confusion, and their mother proceeded with her lecture.\r\n"Could ye find nae night for daffin but Hallowe\'en, and nae time but\r\nwhen the leddy was reading to us about the holy Saints? May ne\'er be in\r\nmy fingers, if I dinna sort ye baith for it!" The eldest boy bent his\r\neyes on the ground, the younger began to weep, but neither spoke;\r\nand the mother would have proceeded to extremities, but for the\r\ninterposition of the little maiden.\r\n\r\n"Dame Elspeth, it was _my_ fault--I did say to them, that I saw a man in\r\nthe spence."\r\n\r\n"And what made you do so, child," said her mother, "to startle us all\r\nthus?"\r\n\r\n"Because," said Mary, lowering her voice, "I could not help it."\r\n\r\n"Not help it, Mary!--you occasioned all this idle noise, and you could\r\nnot help it? How mean you by that, minion?"\r\n\r\n"There really was an armed man in this spence," said Mary; "and because\r\nI was surprised to see him, I cried out to Halbert and Edward--"\r\n\r\n"She has told it herself," said Halbert Glendinning, "or it had never\r\nbeen told by me."\r\n\r\n"Nor by me neither," said Edward, emulously.\r\n\r\n"Mistress Mary," said Elspeth, "you never told us anything before that\r\nwas not true; tell us if this was a Hallowe\'en cantrip, and make an end\r\nof it." The Lady of Avenel looked as if she would have interfered, but\r\nknew not how; and Elspeth, who was too eagerly curious to regard any\r\ndistant hint, persevered in her inquiries. "Was it Christie of the\r\nClint-hill?--I would not for a mark that he were about the house, and a\r\nbody no ken whare."\r\n\r\n"It was not Christie," said Mary; "it was--it was a gentleman--a\r\ngentleman with a bright breastplate, like what I hae seen langsyne, when\r\nwe dwelt at Avenel--"\r\n\r\n"What like was he?" continued Tibb, who now took share in the\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\n"Black-haired, black-eyed, with a peaked black beard," said the child;\r\n"and many a fold of pearling round his neck, and hanging down his breast\r\nower his breastplate; and he had a beautiful hawk, with silver bells,\r\nstanding on his left hand, with a crimson silk hood upon its head--"\r\n\r\n"Ask her no more questions, for the love of God," said the anxious\r\nmenial to Elspeth, "but look to my leddy!" But the Lady of Avenel,\r\ntaking Mary in her hand, turned hastily away, and, walking into the\r\nhall, gave them no opportunity of remarking in what manner she received\r\nthe child\'s communication, which she thus cut short. What Tibb thought\r\nof it appeared from her crossing herself repeatedly, and whispering\r\ninto Elspeth\'s ear, "Saint Mary preserve us!--the lassie has seen her\r\nfather!"\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the hall, they found the lady holding her daughter\r\non her knee, and kissing her repeatedly. When they entered, she again\r\narose, as if to shun observation, and retired to the little apartment\r\nwhere her child and she occupied the same bed.\r\n\r\nThe boys were also sent to their cabin, and no one remained by the hall\r\nfire save the faithful Tibb and dame Elspeth, excellent persons both,\r\nand as thorough gossips as ever wagged a tongue.\r\n\r\nIt was but natural that they should instantly resume the subject of the\r\nsupernatural appearance, for such they deemed it, which had this night\r\nalarmed the family.\r\n\r\n"I could hae wished it had been the deil himself--be good to and\r\npreserve us!--rather than Christie o\' the Clint-hill," said the matron\r\nof the mansion, "for the word runs rife in the country, that he is ane\r\nof the maist masterfu\' thieves ever lap on horse."\r\n\r\n"Hout-tout, Dame Elspeth," said Tibb, "fear ye naething frae Christie;\r\ntods keep their ain holes clean. You kirk-folk make sic a fasherie about\r\nmen shifting a wee bit for their living! Our Border-lairds would ride\r\nwith few men at their back, if a\' the light-handed lads were out o\'\r\ngate."\r\n\r\n"Better they rade wi\' nane than distress the country-side the gate they\r\ndo," said Dame Elspeth.\r\n\r\n"But wha is to haud back the Southron, then," said Tibb, "if ye take\r\naway the lances and broadswords? I trow we auld wives couldna do that\r\nwi\' rock and wheel, and as little the monks wi\' bell and book."\r\n\r\n"And sae weel as the lances and broadswords hae kept them back, I\r\ntrow!--I was mair beholden to ae Southron, and that was Stawarth Bolton,\r\nthan to a\' the border-riders ever wore Saint Andrew\'s cross--I reckon\r\ntheir skelping back and forward, and lifting honest men\'s gear, has been\r\na main cause of a\' the breach between us and England, and I am sure that\r\ncost me a kind goodman. They spoke about the wedding of the Prince and\r\nour Queen, but it\'s as like to be the driving of the Cumberland folk\'s\r\nstocking that brought them down on us like dragons." Tibb would not have\r\nfailed in other circumstances to answer what she thought reflections\r\ndisparaging to her country folk; but she recollected that Dame Elspeth\r\nwas mistress of the family, curbed her own zealous patriotism, and\r\nhastened to change the subject.\r\n\r\n"And is it not strange," she said, "that the heiress of Avenel should\r\nhave seen her father this blessed night?"\r\n\r\n"And ye think it was her father, then?" said Elspeth Glendinning.\r\n\r\n"What else can I think?" said Tibb.\r\n\r\n"It may hae been something waur, in his likeness," said Dame\r\nGlendinning.\r\n\r\n"I ken naething about that," said Tibb,--"but his likeness it was, that\r\nI will be sworn to, just as he used to ride out a-hawking; for having\r\nenemies in the country, he seldom laid off the breast-plate; and for my\r\npart," added Tibb, "I dinna think a man looks like a man unless he has\r\nsteel on his breast, and by his side too."\r\n\r\n"I have no skill of your harness on breast or side either," said Dame\r\nGlendinning; "but I ken there is little luck in Hallowe\'en sights, for I\r\nhave had ane myself."\r\n\r\n"Indeed, Dame Elspeth?" said old Tibb, edging her stool closer to the\r\nhuge elbow-chair occupied by her friend, "I should like to hear about\r\nthat."\r\n\r\n"Ye maun ken, then, Tibb," said Dame Glendinning, "that when I was a\r\nhempie of nineteen or twenty, it wasna my fault if I wasna at a\' the\r\nmerry-makings time about."\r\n\r\n"That was very natural," said Tibb; "but ye hae sobered since that, or\r\nye wadna haud our braw gallants sae lightly."\r\n\r\n"I have had that wad sober me or ony ane," said the matron, "Aweel,\r\nTibb, a lass like me wasna to lack wooers, for I wasna sae ill-favoured\r\nthat the tikes wad bark after me."\r\n\r\n"How should that be," said Tibb, "and you sic a weel-favoured woman to\r\nthis day?"\r\n\r\n"Fie, fie, cummer," said the matron of Glendearg, hitching her seat of\r\nhonour, in her turn, a little nearer to the cuttle-stool on which Tibb\r\nwas seated; "weel-favoured is past my time of day; but I might pass\r\nthen, for I wasna sae tocherless but what I had a bit land at my\r\nbreast-lace. My father was portioner of Little-dearg."\r\n\r\n"Ye hae tell\'d me that before," said Tibb; "but anent the Hallowe\'en?"\r\n\r\n"Aweel, aweel, I had mair joes than ane, but I favoured nane o\' them;\r\nand sae, at Hallowe\'en, Father Nicolas the cellarer--he was cellarer\r\nbefore this father, Father Clement, that now is--was cracking his nuts\r\nand drinking his brown beer with us, and as blithe as might be, and they\r\nwould have me try a cantrip to ken wha suld wed me: and the monk said\r\nthere was nae ill in it, and if there was, he would assoil me for\r\nit. And wha but I into the barn to winnow my three weights o\'\r\nnaething--sair, sair my mind misgave me for fear of wrang-doing and\r\nwrang-suffering baith; but I had aye a bauld spirit. I had not winnowed\r\nthe last weight clean out, and the moon was shining bright upon the\r\nfloor, when in stalked the presence of my dear Simon Glendinning, that\r\nis now happy. I never saw him plainer in my life than I did that moment;\r\nhe held up an arrow as he passed me, and I swarf\'d awa wi\' fright.\r\nMuckle wark there was to bring me to mysell again, and sair they tried\r\nto make me believe it was a trick of Father Nicolas and Simon between\r\nthem, and that the arrow was to signify Cupid\'s shaft, as the Father\r\ncalled it; and mony a time Simon wad threep it to me after I was\r\nmarried--gude man, he liked not it should be said that he was seen out\r\no\' the body!--But mark the end o\' it, Tibb; we were married, and the\r\ngray-goose wing was the death o\' him after a\'!"\r\n\r\n"As it has been of ower mony brave men," said Tibb; "I wish there wasna\r\nsic a bird as a goose in the wide warld, forby the clecking that we hae\r\nat the burn-side."\r\n\r\n"But tell me, Tibb," said Dame Glendinning, "what does your leddy aye do\r\nreading out o\' that thick black book wi\' the silver clasps?--there are\r\nower mony gude words in it to come frae ony body but a priest--An it\r\nwere about Robin Hood, or some o\' David Lindsay\'s ballants, ane wad ken\r\nbetter what to say to it. I am no misdoubting your mistress nae way,\r\nbut I wad like ill to hae a decent house haunted wi\' ghaists and\r\ngyrecarlines."\r\n\r\n"Ye hae nae reason to doubt my leddy, or ony thing she says or does,\r\nDame Glendinning," said the faithful Tibb, something offended; "and\r\ntouching the bairn, it\'s weel kend she was born on Hallowe\'en, was nine\r\nyears gane, and they that are born on Hallowe\'en whiles see mair than\r\nither folk."\r\n\r\n"And that wad be the cause, then, that the bairn didna mak muckle din\r\nabout what it saw?--if it had been my Halbert himself, forby Edward, who\r\nis of softer nature, he wad hae yammered the haill night of a constancy.\r\nBut it\'s like Mistress Mary hae sic sights mair natural to her."\r\n\r\n"That may weel be," said Tibb; "for on Hallowe\'en she was born, as I\r\ntell ye, and our auld parish priest wad fain hae had the night ower,\r\nand All-Hallow day begun. But for a\' that, the sweet bairn is just like\r\nither bairns, as ye may see yourself; and except this blessed night,\r\nand ance before when we were in that weary bog on the road here, I kenna\r\nthat it saw mair than ither folk."\r\n\r\n"But what saw she in the bog, then," said Dame Glendinning, "forby\r\nmoor-cocks and heather-blutters?"\r\n\r\n"The wean saw something like a white leddy that weised us the gate,"\r\nsaid Tibb; "when we were like to hae perished in the moss-hags--certain\r\nit was that Shagram reisted, and I ken Martin thinks he saw something."\r\n\r\n"And what might the white leddy be?" said Elspeth; "have ye ony guess o\'\r\nthat?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s weel kend that, Dame Elspeth," said Tibb; "if ye had lived under\r\ngrit folk, as I hae dune, ye wadna be to seek in that matter."\r\n\r\n"I hae aye keepit my ain ha\' house abune my head," said Elspeth, not\r\nwithout emphasis, "and if I havena lived wi\' grit folk, grit folk have\r\nlived wi\' me."\r\n\r\n"Weel, weel, dame," said Tibb, "your pardon\'s prayed, there was nae\r\noffence meant. But ye maun ken the great ancient families canna be just\r\nserved wi\' the ordinary saunts, (praise to them!) like Saunt Anthony,\r\nSaunt Cuthbert, and the like, that come and gang at every sinner\'s\r\nbidding, but they hae a sort of saunts or angels, or what not, to\r\nthemsells; and as for the White Maiden of Avenel, she is kend ower the\r\nhaill country. And she is aye seen to yammer and wail before ony o\' that\r\nfamily dies, as was weel kend by twenty folk before the death of Walter\r\nAvenel, haly be his cast!"\r\n\r\n"If she can do nae mair than that," said Elspeth, somewhat scornfully,\r\n"they needna make mony vows to her, I trow. Can she make nae better fend\r\nfor them than that, and has naething better to do than wait on them?"\r\n\r\n"Mony braw services can the White Maiden do for them to the boot of\r\nthat, and has dune in the auld histories," said Tibb, "but I mind o\'\r\nnaething in my day, except it was her that the bairn saw in the bog."\r\n\r\n"Aweel, aweel, Tibb," said Dame Glendinning, rising and lighting the\r\niron lamp, "these are great privileges of your grand folk. But our Lady\r\nand Saunt Paul are good eneugh saunts for me, and I\'se warrant them\r\nnever leave me in a bog that they can help me out o\', seeing I send four\r\nwaxen candles to their chapels every Candlemas; and if they are not seen\r\nto weep at my death, I\'se warrant them smile at my joyful rising again,\r\nwhilk Heaven send to all of us, Amen."\r\n\r\n"Amen," answered Tibb, devoutly; "and now it\'s time I should hap up the\r\nwee bit gathering turf, as the fire is ower low."\r\n\r\nBusily she set herself to perform this duty. The relict of Simon\r\nGlendinning did but pause a moment to cast a heedful and cautious glance\r\nall around the hall, to see that nothing was out of its proper place;\r\nthen, wishing Tibb good-night, she retired to repose.\r\n\r\n"The deil\'s in the carline," said Tibb to herself, "because she was\r\nthe wife of a cock-laird, she thinks herself grander, I trow, than the\r\nbower-woman of a lady of that ilk!" Having given vent to her suppressed\r\nspleen in this little ejaculation, Tibb also betook herself to slumber.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter the Fifth.\r\n\r\n\r\n  A priest, ye cry, a priest!--lame shepherds they,\r\n  How shall they gather in the straggling flock?\r\n  Dumb dogs which bark not--how shall they compel\r\n  The loitering vagrants to the Master\'s fold?\r\n  Fitter to bask before the blazing fire,\r\n  And snuff the mess neat-handed Phillis dresses,\r\n  Than on the snow-wreath battle with the wolf.\r\n                           REFORMATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe health of the Lady of Avenel had been gradually decaying ever since\r\nher disaster. It seemed as if the few years which followed her husband\'s\r\ndeath had done on her the work of half a century. She lost the fresh\r\nelasticity of form, the colour and the mien of health, and became\r\nwasted, wan, and feeble. She appeared to have no formed complaint;\r\nyet it was evident to those who looked on her, that her strength waned\r\ndaily. Her lips at length became blenched and her eye dim; yet she spoke\r\nnot of any desire to see a priest, until Elspeth Glendinning in her zeal\r\ncould not refrain from touching upon a point which she deemed essential\r\nto salvation. Alice of Avenel received her hint kindly, and thanked her\r\nfor it.\r\n\r\n"If any good priest would take the trouble of such a journey," she said,\r\n"he should be welcome; for the prayers and lessons of the good must be\r\nat all times advantageous."\r\n\r\nThis quiet acquiescence was not quite what Elspeth Glendinning wished\r\nor expected. She made up, however, by her own enthusiasm, for the lady\'s\r\nwant of eagerness to avail herself of ghostly counsel, and Martin was\r\ndespatched with such haste as Shagram would make, to pray one of\r\nthe religious men of Saint Mary\'s to come up to administer the last\r\nconsolations to the widow of Walter Avenel.\r\n\r\nWhen the Sacristan had announced to the Lord Abbot, that the Lady of\r\nthe umquhile Walter de Avenel was in very weak health in the Tower of\r\nGlendearg, and desired the assistance of a father confessor, the lordly\r\nmonk paused on the request.\r\n\r\n"We do remember Walter de Avenel," he said; "a good knight and\r\na valiant: he was dispossessed of his lands, and slain by the\r\nSouthron--May not the lady come hither to the sacrament of confession?\r\nthe road is distant and painful to travel."\r\n\r\n"The lady is unwell, holy father," answered the Sacristan, "and unable\r\nto bear the journey."\r\n\r\n"True--ay,--yes--then must one of our brethren go to her--Knowest thou\r\nif she hath aught of a jointure from this Walter de Avenel?"\r\n\r\n"Very little, holy father," said the Sacristan; "she hath resided at\r\nGlendearg since her husband\'s death, well-nigh on the charity of a poor\r\nwidow, called Elspeth Glendinning."\r\n\r\n"Why, thou knowest all the widows in the country-side!" said the Abbot.\r\n"Ho! ho! ho!" and he shook his portly sides at his own jest.\r\n\r\n"Ho! ho! ho!" echoed the Sacristan, in the tone and tune in which\r\nan inferior applauds the jest of his superior.--Then added, with a\r\nhypocritical shuffle, and a sly twinkle of his eye, "It is our duty,\r\nmost holy father, to comfort the widow--He! he! he!"\r\n\r\nThis last laugh was more moderate, until the Abbot should put his\r\nsanction on the jest.\r\n\r\n"Ho! ho!" said the Abbot; "then, to leave jesting, Father Philip, take\r\nthou thy riding gear, and go to confess this Dame Avenel."\r\n\r\n"But," said the Sacristan----\r\n\r\n"Give me no _Buts;_ neither But nor If pass between monk and Abbot,\r\nFather Philip; the bands of discipline must not be relaxed--heresy\r\ngathers force like a snow-ball--the multitude expect confessions and\r\npreachings from the Benedictine, as they would from so many beggarly\r\nfriars--and we may not desert the vineyard, though the toil be grievous\r\nunto us."\r\n\r\n"And with so little advantage to the holy monastery," said the\r\nSacristan.\r\n\r\n"True, Father Philip; but wot you not that what preventeth harm doth\r\ngood? This Julian de Avenel lives a light and evil life, and should we\r\nneglect the widow of his brother, he might foray our lands, and we never\r\nable to show who hurt us--moreover it is our duty to an ancient family,\r\nwho, in their day, have been benefactors to the Abbey. Away with thee\r\ninstantly, brother; ride night and day, an it be necessary, and let men\r\nsee how diligent Abbot Boniface and his faithful children are in the\r\nexecution of their spiritual duty--toil not deterring them, for the glen\r\nis five miles in length--fear not withholding them, for it is said to be\r\nhaunted of spectres--nothing moving them from pursuit of their spiritual\r\ncalling; to the confusion of calumnious heretics, and the comfort and\r\nedification of all true and faithful sons of the Catholic Church. I\r\nwonder what our brother Eustace will say to this?"\r\n\r\nBreathless with his own picture of the dangers and toil which he was to\r\nencounter, and the fame which he was to acquire, (both by proxy,) the\r\nAbbot moved slowly to finish his luncheon in the refectory, and the\r\nSacristan, with no very good will, accompanied old Martin in his return\r\nto Glendearg; the greatest impediment in the journey being the trouble\r\nof restraining his pampered mule, that she might tread in something like\r\nan equal pace with poor jaded Shagram.\r\n\r\nAfter remaining an hour in private with his penitent, the monk returned\r\nmoody and full of thought. Dame Elspeth, who had placed for the honoured\r\nguest some refreshment in the hall, was struck with the embarrassment\r\nwhich appeared in his countenance. Elspeth watched him with great\r\nanxiety. She observed there was that on his brow which rather resembled\r\na person come from hearing the confession of some enormous crime, than\r\nthe look of a confessor who resigns a reconciled penitent, not to earth,\r\nbut to heaven. After long hesitating, she could not at length refrain\r\nfrom hazarding a question. She was sure she said, the leddy had made an\r\neasy shrift. Five years had they resided together, and she could safely\r\nsay, no woman lived better.\r\n\r\n"Woman," said the Sacristan, sternly, "thou speakest thou knowest not\r\nwhat--What avails clearing the outside of the platter, if the inside be\r\nfoul with heresy?"\r\n\r\n"Our dishes and trenchers are not so clean as they could be wished,\r\nholy father," said Elspeth, but half understanding what he said, and\r\nbeginning with her apron to wipe the dust from the plates, of which she\r\nsupposed him to complain.\r\n\r\n"Forbear, Dame Elspeth" said the monk; "your plates are as clean as\r\nwooden trenchers and pewter flagons can well be; the foulness of which\r\nI speak is of that pestilential heresy which is daily becoming ingrained\r\nin this our Holy Church of Scotland, and as a canker-worm in the\r\nrose-garland of the Spouse."\r\n\r\n"Holy Mother of Heaven!" said Dame Elspeth, crossing herself, "have I\r\nkept house with a heretic?"\r\n\r\n"No, Elspeth, no," replied the monk; "it were too strong a speech for me\r\nto make of this unhappy lady, but I would I could say she is free\r\nfrom heretical opinions. Alas! they fly about like the pestilence by\r\nnoon-day, and infect even the first and fairest of the flock! For it\r\nis easy to see of this dame, that she hath been high in judgment as in\r\nrank."\r\n\r\n"And she can write and read, I had almost said, as weel as your\r\nreverence" said Elspeth.\r\n\r\n"Whom doth she write to, and what doth she read?" said the monk,\r\neagerly.\r\n\r\n"Nay," replied Elspeth, "I cannot say I ever saw her write at all, but\r\nher maiden that was--she now serves the family--says she can write--And\r\nfor reading, she has often read to us good things out of a thick black\r\nvolume with silver clasps."\r\n\r\n"Let me see it," said the monk, hastily, "on your allegiance as a true\r\nvassal--on your faith as a Catholic Christian--instantly--instantly let\r\nme see it."\r\n\r\nThe good woman hesitated, alarmed at the tone in which the confessor\r\ntook up her information; and being moreover of opinion, that what so\r\ngood a woman as the Lady of Avenel studied so devoutly, could not be of\r\na tendency actually evil. But borne down by the clamour, exclamations,\r\nand something like threats used by Father Philip, she at length brought\r\nhim the fatal volume. It was easy to do this without suspicion on the\r\npart of the owner, as she lay on her bed exhausted with the fatigue of a\r\nlong conference with her confessor, and as the small _round_, or turret\r\ncloset, in which was the book and her other trifling property, was\r\naccessible by another door. Of all her effects the book was the last she\r\nwould have thought of securing, for of what use or interest could it be\r\nin a family who neither read themselves, nor were in the habit of\r\nseeing any who did? so that Dame Elspeth had no difficulty in possessing\r\nherself of the volume, although her heart all the while accused her of\r\nan ungenerous and an inhospitable part towards her friend and inmate.\r\nThe double power of a landlord and a feudal superior was before her\r\neyes; and to say truth, the boldness, with which she might otherwise\r\nhave resisted this double authority, was, I grieve to say it, much\r\nqualified by the curiosity she entertained, as a daughter of Eve, to\r\nhave some explanation respecting the mysterious volume which the lady\r\ncherished with so much care, yet whose contents she imparted with such\r\ncaution. For never had Alice of Avenel read them any passage from the\r\nbook in question until the iron door of the tower was locked, and all\r\npossibility of intrusion prevented. Even then she had shown, by the\r\nselection of particular passages, that she was more anxious to impress\r\non their minds the principles which the volume contained, than to\r\nintroduce them to it as a new rule of faith.\r\n\r\nWhen Elspeth, half curious, half remorseful, had placed the book in the\r\nmonk\'s hands, he exclaimed, after turning over the leaves, "Now, by mine\r\norder, it is as I suspected!--My mule, my mule!--I will abide no longer\r\nhere--well hast thou done, dame, in placing in my hands this perilous\r\nvolume."\r\n\r\n"Is it then witchcraft or devil\'s work?" said Dame Elspeth, in great\r\nagitation.\r\n\r\n"Nay, God forbid!" said the monk, signing himself with the cross, "it\r\nis the Holy Scripture. But it is rendered into the vulgar tongue, and\r\ntherefore, by the order of the Holy Catholic Church, unfit to be in the\r\nhands of any lay person."\r\n\r\n"And yet is the Holy Scripture communicated for our common salvation,"\r\nsaid Elspeth. "Good Father, you must instruct mine ignorance better; but\r\nlack of wit cannot be a deadly sin, and truly, to my poor thinking, I\r\nshould be glad to read the Holy Scripture."\r\n\r\n"I dare say thou wouldst," said the monk; "and even thus did our mother\r\nEve seek to have knowledge of good and evil, and thus Sin came into the\r\nworld, and Death by Sin."\r\n\r\n"I am sure, and it is true," said Elspeth. "Oh, if she had dealt by the\r\ncounsel of Saint Peter and Saint Paul!"\r\n\r\n"If she had reverenced the command of Heaven," said the monk, "which,\r\nas it gave her birth, life, and happiness, fixed upon the grant such\r\nconditions as best corresponded with its holy pleasure. I tell thee,\r\nElspeth, _the Word slayeth_--that is, the text alone, read with\r\nunskilled eye and unhallowed lips, is like those strong medicines which\r\nsick men take by the advice of the learned. Such patients recover and\r\nthrive; while those dealing in them at their own hand, shall perish by\r\ntheir own deed."\r\n\r\n"Nae doubt, nae doubt," said the poor woman, "your reverence knows\r\nbest."\r\n\r\n"Not I," said Father Philip, in a tone as deferential as he thought\r\ncould possibly become the Sacristan of Saint Mary\'s,--"Not I, but the\r\nHoly Father of Christendom, and our own holy father, the Lord Abbot,\r\nknow best. I, the poor Sacristan of Saint Mary\'s, can but repeat what I\r\nhear from others my superiors. Yet of this, good woman, be assured,--the\r\nWord, the mere Word, slayetlh. But the church hath her ministers to\r\ngloze and to expound the same unto her faithful congregation; and this\r\nI say, not so much, my beloved brethren--I mean my beloved sister," (for\r\nthe Sacristan had got into the end of one of his old sermons,)--"This I\r\nspeak not so much of the rectors, curates, and secular clergy, so called\r\nbecause they live after the fashion of the _seculum_ or age, unbound by\r\nthose ties which sequestrate us from the world; neither do I speak\r\nthis of the mendicant friars, whether black or gray, whether crossed or\r\nuncrossed; but of the monks, and especially of the monks Benedictine,\r\nreformed on the rule of Saint Bernard of Clairvaux, thence called\r\nCistercian, of which monks, Christian brethren--sister, I would\r\nsay--great is the happiness and glory of the country in possessing the\r\nholy ministers of Saint Mary\'s, whereof I, though an unworthy brother,\r\nmay say it hath produced more saints, more bishops, more popes--may\r\nour patrons make us thankful!--than any holy foundation in Scotland.\r\nWherefore--But I see Martin hath my mule in readiness, and I will but\r\nsalute you with the kiss of sisterhood, which maketh not ashamed, and so\r\nbetake me to my toilsome return, for the glen is of bad reputation for\r\nthe evil spirits which haunt it. Moreover, I may arrive too late at the\r\nbridge, whereby I may be obliged to take to the river, which I observed\r\nto be somewhat waxen."\r\n\r\nAccordingly, he took his leave of Dame Elspeth, who was confounded by\r\nthe rapidity of his utterance, and the doctrine he gave forth, and by no\r\nmeans easy on the subject of the book, which her conscience told her she\r\nshould not have communicated to any one, without the knowledge of its\r\nowner.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the haste which the monk as well as the mule made to\r\nreturn to better quarters than they had left at the head of Glendearg;\r\nnotwithstanding the eager desire Father Philip had to be the very first\r\nwho should acquaint the Abbot that a copy of the book they most\r\ndreaded had been found within the Halidome, or patrimony of the Abbey;\r\nnotwithstanding, moreover, certain feelings which induced him to hurry\r\nas fast as possible through the gloomy and evil-reputed glen, still\r\nthe difficulties of the road, and the rider\'s want of habitude of quick\r\nmotion, were such, that twilight came upon him ere he had nearly cleared\r\nthe narrow valley. It was indeed a gloomy ride. The two sides of the\r\nvale were so near, that at every double of the river the shadows from\r\nthe western sky fell upon, and totally obscured, the eastern bank; the\r\nthickets of copsewood seemed to wave with a portentous agitation of\r\nboughs and leaves, and the very crags and scaurs seemed higher and\r\ngrimmer than they had appeared to the monk while he was travelling in\r\ndaylight, and in company. Father Philip was heartily rejoiced, when,\r\nemerging from the narrow glen, he gained the open valley of the Tweed,\r\nwhich held on its majestic course from current to pool, and from pool\r\nstretched away to other currents, with a dignity peculiar to itself\r\namongst the Scottish rivers; for whatever may have been the drought\r\nof the season, the Tweed usually fills up the space between its banks,\r\nseldom leaving those extensive sheets of shingle which deform the\r\nmargins of many of the celebrated Scottish streams.\r\n\r\nThe monk, insensible to beauties which the age had not regarded as\r\ndeserving of notice, was, nevertheless, like a prudent general, pleased\r\nto find himself out of the narrow glen in which the enemy might have\r\nstolen upon him unperceived. He drew up his bridle, reduced his mule\r\nto her natural and luxurious amble, instead of the agitating and\r\nbroken trot at which, to his no small inconvenience, she had hitherto\r\nproceeded, and, wiping his brow, gazed forth at leisure on the broad\r\nmoon, which, now mingling with the lights of evening, was rising over\r\nfield and forest, village and fortalice, and, above all, over the\r\nstately Monastery, seen far and dim amid the vellow light.\r\n\r\nThe worst part of the magnificent view, in the monk\'s apprehension, was,\r\nthat the Monastery stood on the opposite side of the river, and that of\r\nthe many fine bridges which have since been built across that classical\r\nstream, not one then existed. There was, however, in recompense, a\r\nbridge then standing which has since disappeared, although its ruins may\r\nstill be traced by the curious.\r\n\r\nIt was of a very peculiar form. Two strong abutments were built on\r\neither side of the river, at a part where the stream was peculiarly\r\ncontracted. Upon a rock in the centre of the current was built a solid\r\npiece of masonry, constructed like the pier of a bridge, and presenting,\r\nlike a pier, an angle to the current of the stream. The masonry\r\ncontinued solid until the pier rose to a level with the two abutments\r\nupon either side, and from thence the building rose in the form of a\r\ntower. The lower story of this tower consisted only of an archway or\r\npassage through the building, over either entrance to which hung a\r\ndrawbridge with counterpoises, either of which, when dropped, connected\r\nthe archway with the opposite abutment, where the farther end of the\r\ndrawbridge rested. When both bridges were thus lowered, the passage over\r\nthe river was complete.\r\n\r\nThe bridge-keeper, who was the dependant of a neighbouring baron,\r\nresided with his family in the second and third stories of the tower,\r\nwhich, when both drawbridges were raised, formed an insulated fortalice\r\nin the midst of the river. He was entitled to a small toll or custom\r\nfor the passage, concerning the amount of which disputes sometimes\r\narose between him and the passengers. It is needless to say, that the\r\nbridge-ward had usually the better in these questions, since he could at\r\npleasure detain the traveller on the opposite side; or, suffering him\r\nto pass half way, might keep him prisoner in his tower till they were\r\nagreed on the rate of pontage.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: A bridge of the very peculiar construction described in the\r\ntext, actually existed at a small hamlet about a mile and a half above\r\nMelrose, called from the circumstance Bridge-end. It is thus noticed in\r\nGordon\'s _Iter Septentrionale_:--\r\n\r\n"In another journey through the south parts of Scotland, about a mile\r\nand a half from Melrose, in the shire of Teviotdale, I saw the remains\r\nof a curious bridge over the river Tweed, consisting of three octangular\r\npillars, or rather towers, standing within the water, without any arches\r\nto join them. The middle one, which is the most entire, has a door\r\ntowards the north, and I suppose another opposite one toward the south,\r\nwhich I could not see without crossing the water. In the middle of this\r\ntower is a projection or cornice surrounding it: the whole is hollow\r\nfrom the door upwards, and now open at the top, near which is a small\r\nwindow. I was informed that not long agro a countryman and his family\r\nlived in this tower--and got his livelihood by laying out planks from\r\npillar to pillar, and conveying passengers over the river. Whether this\r\nbe ancient or modern, I know not; but as it is singular in its kind I\r\nhave thought fit to exhibit it."\r\n\r\nThe vestiges of this uncommon species of bridge still exist, and the\r\nauthor has often seen the foundations of the columns when drifting down\r\nthe Tweed at night for the purpose of killing salmon by torch-light.\r\nMr. John Mercer of Bridge-end recollects, that about fifty years ago the\r\npillars were visible above water; and the late Mr. David Kyle, of the\r\nGeorge Inn, Melrose, told the author that he saw a stone taken from the\r\nriver bearing this inscription:--\r\n\r\n"I, Sir John Pringle of Palmer stede, Give an hundred markis of gowd sae\r\nreid, To help to bigg my brigg ower Tweed."\r\n\r\nPringle of Galashiels, afterwards of Whytbank, was the Baron to whom the\r\nbridge belonged.]\r\n\r\nBut it was most frequently with the Monks of Saint Mary\'s that the\r\nwarder had to dispute his perquisites. These holy men insisted for, and\r\nat length obtained, a right of gratuitous passage to themselves, greatly\r\nto the discontent of the bridge-keeper. But when they demanded the\r\nsame immunity for the numerous pilgrims who visited the shrine, the\r\nbridge-keeper waxed restive, and was supported by his lord in his\r\nresistance. The controversy grew animated on both sides; the Abbot\r\nmenaced excommunication, and the keeper of the bridge, though unable to\r\nretaliate in kind, yet made each individual monk who had to cross and\r\nrecross the river, endure a sort of purgatory, ere he would accommodate\r\nthem with a passage. This was a great inconvenience, and would have\r\nproved a more serious one, but that the river was fordable for man and\r\nhorse in ordinary weather.\r\n\r\nIt was a fine moonlight night, as we have already said, when Father\r\nPhilip approached this bridge, the singular construction of which gives\r\na curious idea of the insecurity of the times. The river was not in\r\nflood, but it was above its ordinary level--_a heavy water_, as it\r\nis called in that country, through which the monk had no particular\r\ninclination to ride, if he could manage the matter better.\r\n\r\n"Peter, my good friend," cried the Sacristan, raising his voice; "my\r\nvery excellent friend, Peter, be so kind as to lower the drawbridge.\r\nPeter, I say, dost thou not hear?--it is thy gossip, Father Philip, who\r\ncalls thee."\r\n\r\nPeter heard him perfectly well, and saw him into the bargain; but as he\r\nhad considered the Sacristan as peculiarly his enemy in his dispute\r\nwith the convent, he went quietly to bed, after reconnoitring the monk\r\nthrough his loop-hole, observing to his wife, that "riding the water in\r\na moonlight night would do the Sacristan no harm, and would teach him\r\nthe value of a brig the neist time, on whilk a man might pass high and\r\ndry, winter and summer, flood and ebb."\r\n\r\nAfter exhausting his voice in entreaties and threats, which were equally\r\nunattended to by Peter of the Brig, as he was called, Father Philip at\r\nlength moved down the river to take the ordinary ford at the head of\r\nthe next stream. Cursing the rustic obstinacy of Peter, he began,\r\nnevertheless, to persuade himself that the passage of the river by the\r\nford was not only safe, but pleasant. The banks and scattered trees were\r\nso beautifully reflected from the bosom of the dark stream, the whole\r\ncool and delicious picture formed so pleasing a contrast to his late\r\nagitation, to the warmth occasioned by his vain endeavours to move the\r\nrelentless porter of the bridge, that the result was rather agreeable\r\nthan otherwise.\r\n\r\nAs Father Philip came close to the water\'s edge, at the spot where\r\nhe was to enter it, there sat a female under a large broken scathed\r\noak-tree, or rather under the remains of such a tree, weeping, wringing\r\nher hands, and looking earnestly on the current of the river. The monk\r\nwas struck with astonishment to see a female there at that time of\r\nnight. But he was, in all honest service,--and if a step farther, I put\r\nit upon his own conscience,--a devoted squire of dames. After observing\r\nthe maiden for a moment, although she seemed to take no notice of\r\nhis presence, he was moved by her distress, and willing to offer his\r\nassistance. "Damsel," said he, "thou seemest in no ordinary distress;\r\nperadventure, like myself, thou hast been refused passage at the bridge\r\nby the churlish keeper, and thy crossing may concern thee either for\r\nperformance of a vow, or some other weighty charge."\r\n\r\nThe maiden uttered some inarticulate sounds, looked at the river, and\r\nthen in the face of the Sacristan. It struck Father Philip at that\r\ninstant, that a Highland chief of distinction had been for some time\r\nexpected to pay his vows at the shrine of Saint Mary\'s; and that\r\npossibly this fair maiden might be one of his family, travelling alone\r\nfor accomplishment of a vow, or left behind by some accident, to whom,\r\ntherefore, it would be but right and prudent to use every civility\r\nin his power, especially as she seemed unacquainted with the Lowland\r\ntongue. Such at least was the only motive the Sacristan was ever known\r\nto assign for his courtesy; if there was any other, I once more refer it\r\nto his own conscience.\r\n\r\nTo express himself by signs, the common language of all nations, the\r\ncautious Sacristan first pointed to the river, then to his mule\'s\r\ncrupper, and then made, as gracefully as he could, a sign to induce the\r\nfair solitary to mount behind him. She seemed to understand his meaning,\r\nfor she rose up as if to accept his offer; and while the good monk, who,\r\nas we have hinted, was no great cavalier, laboured, with the pressure of\r\nthe right leg and the use of the left rein, to place his mule with her\r\nside to the bank in such a position that the lady might mount with ease,\r\nshe rose from the ground with rather portentous activity, and at one\r\nbound sate behind the monk upon the animal, much the firmer rider of the\r\ntwo. The mule by no means seemed to approve of this double burden; she\r\nbounded, bolted, and would soon have thrown Father Philip over her head,\r\nhad not the maiden with a firm hand detained him in the saddle.\r\n\r\nAt last the restive brute changed her humour; and, from refusing to\r\nbudge off the spot, suddenly stretched her nose homeward, and dashed\r\ninto the ford as fast as she could scamper. A new terror now invaded\r\nthe monk\'s mind--the ford seemed unusually deep, the water eddied off in\r\nstrong ripple from the counter of the mule, and began to rise upon her\r\nside. Philip lost his presence of mind,--which was at no time his most\r\nready attribute, the mule yielded to the weight of the current, and as\r\nthe rider was not attentive to keep her head turned up the river, she\r\ndrifted downward, lost the ford and her footing at once, and began to\r\nswim with her head down the stream. And what was sufficiently strange,\r\nat the same moment, notwithstanding the extreme peril, the damsel began\r\nto sing, thereby increasing, if anything could increase, the bodily fear\r\nof the worthy Sacristan.\r\n\r\n               I.\r\n\r\n  Merrily swim we, the moon shines bright,\r\n  Both current and ripple are dancing in light.\r\n  We have roused the night raven, I heard him croak,\r\n  As we plashed along beneath the oak\r\n  That flings its broad branches so far and so wide,\r\n  Their shadows are dancing in midst of the tide.\r\n  "Who wakens my nestlings," the raven he said,\r\n  "My beak shall ere morn in his blood be red.\r\n  For a blue swoln corpse is a dainty meal.\r\n  And I\'ll have my share with the pike and the eel."\r\n\r\n               II.\r\n\r\n  Merrily swim we, the moon shines bright,\r\n  There\'s a golden gleam on the distant height;\r\n  There\'s a silver shower on the alders dank.\r\n  And the drooping willows that wave on the bank.\r\n  I see the abbey, both turret and tower,\r\n  It is all astir for the vesper hour;\r\n  The monks for the chapel are leaving each cell.\r\n  But Where\'s Father Philip, should toll the bell?\r\n\r\n               III.\r\n\r\n  Merrily swim we, the moon shines bright,\r\n  Downward we drift through shadow and light,\r\n  Under yon rock the eddies sleep,\r\n  Calm and silent, dark and deep.\r\n  The Kelpy has risen from the fathomless pool.\r\n  He has lighted his candle of death and of dool.\r\n  Look, Father, look, and you\'ll laugh to see\r\n  How he gapes and glares with his eyes on thee.\r\n\r\n               IV.\r\n\r\n  Good luck to your fishing, whom watch ye to-night?\r\n  A man of mean, or a man of might?\r\n  Is it layman or priest that must float in your cove,\r\n  Or lover who crosses to visit his love?\r\n  Hark! heard ye the Kelpy reply, as we pass\'d,--\r\n  "God\'s blessing on the warder, he lock\'d the bridge fast!\r\n  All that come to my cove are sunk,\r\n  Priest or layman, lover or monk."\r\n\r\n\r\nHow long the damsel might have continued to sing, or where the terrified\r\nmonk\'s journey might have ended, is uncertain. As she sung the last\r\nstanza, they arrived at, or rather in, a broad tranquil sheet of water,\r\ncaused by a strong wear or damhead, running across the river, which\r\ndashed in a broad cataract over the barrier. The mule, whether from\r\nchoice, or influenced by the suction of the current, made towards the\r\ncut intended to supply the convent mills, and entered it half swimming\r\nhalf wading, and pitching the unlucky monk to and fro in the saddle at a\r\nfearful rate.\r\n\r\nAs his person flew hither and thither, his garment became loose, and in\r\nan effort to retain it, his hand lighted on the volume of the Lady of\r\nAvenel which was in his bosom. No sooner had he grasped it, than his\r\ncompanion pitched him out of the saddle into the stream, where, still\r\nkeeping her hand on his collar, she gave him two or three good souses in\r\nthe watery fluid, so as to ensure that every other part of him had its\r\nshare of wetting, and then quitted her hold when he was so near the\r\nside that by a slight effort (of a great one he was incapable) he might\r\nscramble on shore. This accordingly he accomplished, and turning his\r\neyes to see what had become of his extraordinary companion, she was\r\nnowhere to be seen; but still he heard, as if from the surface of the\r\nriver, and mixing with the noise of the water breaking over the damhead,\r\na fragment of her wild song, which seemed to run thus:--\r\n\r\n  Landed--landed! the black book hath won.\r\n  Else had you seen Berwick with morning sun!\r\n  Sain ye, and save ye, and blithe mot ye be,\r\n  For seldom they land that go swimming with me.\r\n\r\nThe ecstasy of the monk\'s terror could be endured no longer; his head\r\ngrew dizzy, and, after staggering a few steps onward and running himself\r\nagainst a wall, he sunk down in a state of insensibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter the Sixth.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Now let us sit in conclave. That these weeds\r\n  Be rooted from the vineyard of the church.\r\n  That these foul tares be severed from the wheat,\r\n  We are, I trust, agreed.--Yet how to do this,\r\n  Nor hurt the wholesome crop and tender vine-plants,\r\n  Craves good advisement.\r\n\r\nTHE REFORMATION.\r\n\r\nThe vesper service in the Monastery Church of Saint Mary\'s was now over.\r\nThe Abbot had disrobed himself of his magnificent vestures of ceremony,\r\nand resumed his ordinary habit, which was a black gown, worn over a\r\nwhite cassock, with a narrow scapulary; a decent and venerable dress,\r\nwhich was calculated to set off to advantage the portly mien of Abbot\r\nBoniface.\r\n\r\nIn quiet times no one could have filled the state of a mitred Abbot, for\r\nsuch was his dignity, more respectably than this worthy prelate. He had,\r\nno doubt, many of those habits of self-indulgence which men are apt to\r\nacquire who live for themselves alone. He was vain, moreover; and when\r\nboldly confronted, had sometimes shown symptoms of timidity, not very\r\nconsistent with the high claims which he preferred as an eminent member\r\nof the church, or with the punctual deference which he exacted from his\r\nreligious brethren, and all who were placed under his command. But\r\nhe was hospitable, charitable, and by no means of himself disposed to\r\nproceed with severity against any one. In short, he would in other times\r\nhave slumbered out his term of preferment with as much credit as\r\nany other "purple Abbot," who lived easily, but at the same time\r\ndecorously--slept soundly, and did not disquiet himself with dreams.\r\n\r\nBut the wide alarm spread through the whole Church of Rome by the\r\nprogress of the reformed doctrines, sorely disturbed the repose of Abbot\r\nBoniface, and opened to him a wide field of duties and cares which he\r\nhad never so much as dreamed of. There were opinions to be combated\r\nand refuted--practices to be inquired into--heretics to be detected\r\nand punished--the fallen off to be reclaimed--the wavering to be\r\nconfirmed--scandal to be removed from the clergy, and the vigour of\r\ndiscipline to be re-established. Post upon post arrived at the Monastery\r\nof Saint Mary\'s--horses reeking, and riders exhausted--this from the\r\nPrivy Council, that from the Primate of Scotland, and this other again\r\nfrom the Queen Mother, exhorting, approving, condemning, requesting\r\nadvice upon this subject, and requiring information upon that.\r\n\r\nThese missives Abbot Boniface received with an important air of\r\nhelplessness, or a helpless air of importance,--whichever the reader\r\nmay please to term it, evincing at once gratified vanity, and profound\r\ntrouble of mind. The sharp-witted Primate of Saint Andrews had foreseen\r\nthe deficiencies of the Abbot of St. Mary\'s, and endeavoured to provide\r\nfor them by getting admitted into his Monastery as Sub-Prior a brother\r\nCistercian, a man of parts and knowledge, devoted to the service of\r\nthe Catholic Church, and very capable not only to advise the Abbot on\r\noccasions of difficulty, but to make him sensible of his duty in case he\r\nshould, from good-nature or timidity, be disposed to shrink from it.\r\n\r\nFather Eustace played the same part in the Monastery as the old general\r\nwho, in foreign armies, is placed at the elbow of the Prince of the\r\nBlood, who nominally commands in chief, on condition of attempting\r\nnothing without the advice of his dry-nurse; and he shared the fate of\r\nall such dry-nurses, being heartily disliked as well as feared by his\r\nprincipal. Still, however, the Primate\'s intention was fully answered.\r\nFather Eustace became the constant theme and often the bugbear of the\r\nworthy Abbot, who hardly dared to turn himself in his bed without,\r\nconsidering what Father Eustace would think of it. In every case of\r\ndifficulty, Father Eustace was summoned, and his opinion asked; and no\r\nsooner was the embarrassment removed, than the Abbot\'s next thought was\r\nhow to get rid of his adviser. In every letter which he wrote to those\r\nin power, he recommended Father Eustace to some high church preferment,\r\na bishopric or an abbey; and as they dropped one after another, and were\r\notherwise conferred, he began to think, as he confessed to the Sacristan\r\nin the bitterness of his spirit, that the Monastery of St. Mary\'s had\r\ngot a life-rent lease of their Sub-Prior.\r\n\r\nYet more indignant he would have been, had he suspected that Father\r\nEustace\'s ambition was fixed upon his own mitre, which, from some\r\nattacks of an apoplectic nature, deemed by the Abbot\'s friends to be\r\nmore serious than by himself, it was supposed might be shortly vacant.\r\nBut the confidence which, like other dignitaries, he reposed in his\r\nown health, prevented Abbot Boniface from imagining that it held any\r\nconcatenation, with the motions of Father Eustace.\r\n\r\nThe necessity under which he found himself of consulting with his\r\ngrand adviser, in cases of real difficulty, rendered the worthy Abbot\r\nparticularly desirous of doing without him in all ordinary cases of\r\nadministration, though not without considering what Father Eustace would\r\nhave said of the matter. He scorned, therefore, to give a hint to the\r\nSub-Prior of the bold stroke by which he had dispatched Brother Philip\r\nto Glendearg; but when the vespers came without his reappearance he\r\nbecame a little uneasy, the more as other matters weighed upon his\r\nmind. The feud with the warder or keeper of the bridge threatened to be\r\nattended with bad consequences, as the man\'s quarrel was taken up by\r\nthe martial baron under whom he served; and pressing letters of an\r\nunpleasant tendency had just arrived from the Primate. Like a gouty\r\nman, who catches hold of his crutch while he curses the infirmity that\r\ninduces him to use if, the Abbot, however reluctant, found himself\r\nobliged to require Eustace\'s presence, after the service was over, in\r\nhis house, or rather palace, which was attached to, and made part of,\r\nthe Monastery.\r\n\r\nAbbot Boniface was seated in his high-backed chair, the grotesque carved\r\nback of which terminated in a mitre, before a fire where two or three\r\nlarge logs were reduced to one red glowing mass of charcoal. At his\r\nelbow, on an oaken stand, stood the remains of a roasted capon, on which\r\nhis reverence had made his evening meal, flanked by a goodly stoup of\r\nBordeaux of excellent flavour. He was gazing indolently on the fire,\r\npartly engaged in meditation on his past and present fortunes, partly\r\noccupied by endeavouring to trace towers and steeples in the red embers.\r\n\r\n"Yes," thought the Abbot to himself, "in that red perspective I could\r\nfancy to myself the peaceful towers of Dundrennan, where I passed my\r\nlife ere I was called to pomp and to trouble. A quiet brotherhood we\r\nwere, regular in our domestic duties; and when the frailties of humanity\r\nprevailed over us, we confessed, and were absolved by each other, and\r\nthe most formidable part of the penance was the jest of the convent on\r\nthe culprit. I can almost fancy that I see the cloister garden, and\r\nthe pear-trees which I grafted with my own hands. And for what have I\r\nchanged all this, but to be overwhelmed with business which concerns me\r\nnot, to be called My Lord Abbot, and to be tutored by Father Eustace? I\r\nwould these towers were the Abbey of Aberbrothwick, and Father Eustace\r\nthe Abbot,--or I would he were in the fire on any terms, so I were rid\r\nof him! The Primate says our Holy Father, the Pope hath an adviser--I am\r\nsure he could not live a week with such a one as mine. Then there is\r\nno learning what Father Eustace thinks till you confess your own\r\ndifficulties--No hint will bring forth his opinion--he is like a miser,\r\nwho will not unbuckle his purse to bestow a farthing, until the wretch\r\nwho needs it has owned his excess of poverty, and wrung out the boon\r\nby importunity. And thus I am dishonoured in the eyes of my religious\r\nbrethren, who behold me treated like a child which hath no sense of\r\nits own--I will bear it no longer!--Brother Bennet,"--(a lay brother\r\nanswered to his call)--" tell Father Eustace that I need not his\r\npresence."\r\n\r\n"I came to say to your reverence, that the holy father is entering even\r\nnow from the cloisters."\r\n\r\n"Be it so," said the Abbot, "he is welcome,--remove these things--or\r\nrather, place a trencher, the holy father may be a little hungry--yet,\r\nno--remove them, for there is no good fellowship in him--Let the stoup\r\nof wine remain, however, and place another cup."\r\n\r\nThe lay brother obeyed these contradictory commands in the way he judged\r\nmost seemly--he removed the carcass of the half-sacked capon, and placed\r\ntwo goblets beside the stoup of Bourdeaux. At the same instant entered\r\nFather Eustace.\r\n\r\nHe was a thin, sharp-faced, slight-made little man, whose keen grey eyes\r\nseemed almost to look through the person to whom he addressed himself.\r\nHis body was emaciated not only with the fasts which he observed with\r\nrigid punctuality, but also by the active and unwearied exercise of his\r\nsharp and piercing intellect;--\r\n\r\n  A fiery soul, which working out its way,\r\n  Fretted the puny body to decay,\r\n  And o\'er-informed the tenement of clay.\r\n\r\nHe turned with conventual reverence to the Lord Abbot; and as they stood\r\ntogether, it was scarce possible to see a more complete difference of\r\nform and expression. The good-natured rosy face and laughing eye of the\r\nAbbot, which even his present anxiety could not greatly ruffle, was a\r\nwonderful contrast to the thin pallid cheek and quick penetrating glance\r\nof the monk, in which an eager and keen spirit glanced through eyes to\r\nwhich it seemed to give supernatural lustre.\r\n\r\nThe Abbot opened the conversation by motioning to his monk to take a\r\nstool, and inviting to a cup of wine. The courtesy was declined with\r\nrespect, yet not without a remark, that the vesper service was past.\r\n\r\n"For the stomach\'s sake, brother," said the Abbot, colouring a\r\nlittle--"You know the text."\r\n\r\n"It is a dangerous one," answered the monk, "to handle alone, or at\r\nlate hours. Out off from human society, the juice of the grape becomes a\r\nperilous companion of solitude, and therefore I ever shun it."\r\n\r\nAbbot Boniface had poured himself out a goblet which might hold\r\nabout half an English pint; but, either struck with the truth of the\r\nobservation, or ashamed to act in direct opposition to it, he suffered\r\nit to remain untasted before him, and immediately changed the subject.\r\n\r\n"The Primate hath written to us," said he, "to make strict search within\r\nour bounds after the heretical persons denounced in this list, who have\r\nwithdrawn themselves from the justice which their opinions deserve. It\r\nis deemed probable that they will attempt to retire to England by our\r\nBorders, and the Primate requireth me to watch with vigilance, and what\r\nnot."\r\n\r\n"Assuredly," said the monk, "the magistrate should not bear the sword in\r\nvain--those be they that turn the world upside down--and doubtless your\r\nreverend wisdom will with due diligence second the exertions of the\r\nRight Reverend Father in God, being in the peremptory defence of the\r\nHoly Church."\r\n\r\n"Ay, but how is this to be done?" answered the Abbot; "Saint Mary aid\r\nus! The Primate writes to me as if I were a temporal baron--a man under\r\ncommand, having soldiers under him! He says, send forth--scour the\r\ncountry--guard the passes--Truly these men do not travel as those who\r\nwould give their lives for nothing--the last who went south passed the\r\ndry-march at the Riding-burn with an escort of thirty spears, as our\r\nreverend brother the Abbot of Kelso did write unto us. How are cowls and\r\nscapularies to stop the way?"\r\n\r\n"Your bailiff is accounted a good man at arms, holy father," said\r\nEustace; "your vassals are obliged to rise for the defence of the Holy\r\nKirk--it is the tenure on which they hold their lands--if they will not\r\ncome forth for the Church which gives them bread, let their possessions\r\nbe given to others."\r\n\r\n"We shall not be wanting," said the Abbot, collecting himself with\r\nimportance, "to do whatever may advantage Holy Kirk--thyself shall\r\nhear the charge to our Bailiff and our officials--but here again is\r\nour controversy with the warden of the bridge and the Baron of\r\nMeigallot--Saint Mary! vexations do so multiply upon the House, and upon\r\nthe generation, that a man wots not where to turn to! Thou didst say,\r\nFather Eustace, thou wouldst look into our evidents touching this free\r\npassage for the pilgrims?"\r\n\r\n"I have looked into the Chartulary of the House, holy father," said\r\nEustace, "and therein I find a written and formal grant of all\r\nduties and customs payable at the drawbridge of Brigton, not only by\r\necclesiastics of this foundation, but by every pilgrim truly designed to\r\naccomplish his vows at this House, to the Abbot Allford, and the monks\r\nof the House of Saint Mary in Kennaquhair, from that time and for ever.\r\nThe deed is dated on Saint Bridget\'s Even, in the year of Redemption,\r\n1137, and bears the sign and seal of the granter, Charles of Meigallot,\r\ngreat-great-grandfather of this baron, and purports to be granted for\r\nthe safety of his own soul, and for the weal of the souls of his father\r\nand mother, and of all his predecessors and successors, being Barons of\r\nMeigallot."\r\n\r\n"But he alleges," said the Abbot, "that the bridge-wards have been in\r\npossession of these dues, and have rendered them available for more than\r\nfifty years--and the baron threatens violence--meanwhile, the journey of\r\nthe pilgrims is interrupted, to the prejudice of their own souls and the\r\ndiminution of the revenues of Saint Mary. The Sacristan advised us to\r\nput on a boat; but the warden, whom thou knowest to be a godless man,\r\nhas sworn the devil tear him, but that if they put on a boat on the\r\nlaird\'s stream, he will rive her board from board--and then some say\r\nwe should compound the claim for a small sum in silver." Here the Abbot\r\npaused a moment for a reply, but receiving none, he added, "But what\r\nthinkest thou, Father Eustace? why art thou silent?"\r\n\r\n"Because I am surprised at the question which the Lord Abbot of Saint\r\nMary\'s asks at the youngest of his brethren."\r\n\r\n"Youngest in time of your abode with us, Brother Eustace," said the\r\nAbbot, "not youngest in years, or I think in experience. Sub-Prior also\r\nof this convent."\r\n\r\n"I am astonished," continued Eustace, "that the Abbot of this venerable\r\nhouse should ask of any one whether he can alienate the patrimony of\r\nour holy and divine patroness, or give up to an unconscientious, and\r\nperhaps, a heretic baron, the rights conferred on this church by his\r\ndevout progenitor. Popes and councils alike prohibit it--the honour of\r\nthe living, and the weal of departed souls, alike forbid it--it may not\r\nbe. To force, if he dare use it, we must surrender; but never by our\r\nconsent should we see the goods of the church plundered, with as little\r\nscruple as he would drive off a herd of English beeves. Rouse yourself,\r\nReverend father, and doubt nothing but that the good cause shall\r\nprevail. Whet the spiritual sword, and direct it against the wicked\r\nwho would usurp our holy rights. Whet the temporal sword, if it be\r\nnecessary, and stir up the courage and zeal of your loyal vassals."\r\n\r\nThe Abbot sighed deeply. "All this," he said, "is soon spoken by him who\r\nhath to act it not; but--" He was interrupted by the entrance of Bennet\r\nrather hastily. "The mule on which the Sacristan had set out in the\r\nmorning had returned," he said, "to the convent stable all over wet, and\r\nwith the saddle turned round beneath her belly."\r\n\r\n"Sancta Maria!" said the Abbot, "our dear brother hath perished by the\r\nway!"\r\n\r\n"It may not be," said Eustace, hastily--"let the bell be tolled--cause\r\nthe brethren to get torches--alarm the village--hurry down to the\r\nriver--I myself will be the foremost."\r\n\r\nThe real Abbot stood astonished and agape, when at once he beheld his\r\noffice filled, and saw all which he ought to have ordered, going forward\r\nat the dictates of the youngest monk in the convent. But ere the\r\norders of Eustace, which nobody dreamed of disputing, were carried into\r\nexecution, the necessity was prevented by the sudden apparition of the\r\nSacristan, whose supposed danger excited all the alarm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter the Seventh.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Raze out the written troubles of the brain,\r\n     Cleanse the foul bosom of the perilous stuff\r\n     That weighs upon the heart.\r\n                                         MACBETH.\r\n\r\nWhat betwixt cold and fright the afflicted Sacristan stood before his\r\nSuperior, propped on the friendly arm of the convent miller, drenched\r\nwith water, and scarce able to utter a syllable.\r\n\r\nAfter various attempts to speak, the first words he uttered were,\r\n\r\n  "Swim we merrily--the moon shines bright."\r\n\r\n"Swim we merrily!" retorted the Abbot, indignantly; "a merry night have\r\nye chosen for swimming, and a becoming salutation to your Superior!"\r\n\r\n"Our brother is bewildered," said Eustace;--"speak, Father Philip, how\r\nis it with you?"\r\n\r\n  "Good luck to your fishing,"\r\n\r\ncontinued the Sacristan, making a most dolorous attempt at the tune of\r\nhis strange companion.\r\n\r\n"Good luck to your fishing!" repeated the Abbot, still more surprised\r\nthan displeased; "by my halidome he is drunken with wine, and comes to\r\nour presence with his jolly catches in his throat! If bread and water\r\ncan cure this folly--"\r\n\r\n"With your pardon, venerable father," said the Sub-Prior, "of water\r\nour brother has had enough; and methinks, the confusion of his eye, is\r\nrather that of terror, than of aught unbecoming his profession. Where\r\ndid you find him, Hob Miller?"\r\n\r\n"An it please your reverence, I did but go to shut the sluice of the\r\nmill--and as I was going to shut the sluice, I heard something groan\r\nnear to me; but judging it was one of Giles Fletcher\'s hogs--for so\r\nplease you he never shuts his gate--I caught up my lever, and was\r\nabout--Saint Mary forgive me!--to strike where I heard the sound, when,\r\nas the saints would have it, I heard the second groan just like that of\r\na living man. So I called up my knaves, and found the Father Sacristan\r\nlying wet and senseless under the wall of our kiln. So soon as we\r\nbrought him to himself a bit, he prayed to be brought to your reverence,\r\nbut I doubt me his wits have gone a bell-wavering by the road. It was\r\nbut now that he spoke in somewhat better form."\r\n\r\n"Well!" said Brother Eustace, "thou hast done well, Hob Miller; only\r\nbegone now, and remember a second time to pause, ere you strike in the\r\ndark."\r\n\r\n"Please your reverence, it shall be a lesson to me," said the miller,\r\n"not to mistake a holy man for a hog again, so long as I live." And,\r\nmaking a bow, with profound humility, the miller withdrew.\r\n\r\n"And now that this churl is gone, Father Philip," said Eustace,\r\n"wilt thou tell our venerable Superior what ails thee? art thou _vino\r\ngravatus,_ man? if so we will have thee to thy cell."\r\n\r\n"Water! water! not wine," muttered the exhausted Sacristan.\r\n\r\n"Nay," said the monk, "if that be thy complaint, wine may perhaps cure\r\nthee;" and he reached him a cup, which the patient drank off to his\r\ngreat benefit.\r\n\r\n"And now," said the Abbot, "let his garments be changed, or rather\r\nlet him be carried to the infirmary; for it will prejudice our health,\r\nshould we hear his narrative while he stands there, steaming like a\r\nrising hoar-frost."\r\n\r\n"I will hear his adventure," said Eustace, "and report it to your\r\nreverence." And, accordingly, he attended the Sacristan to his cell. In\r\nabout half an hour he returned to the Abbot.\r\n\r\n"How is it with Father Philip?" said the Abbot; "and through what came\r\nhe into such a state?"\r\n\r\n"He comes from Glendearg, reverend sir," said Eustace; "and for the\r\nrest, he telleth such a legend, as has not been heard in this Monastery\r\nfor many a long day." He then gave the Abbot the outlines of the\r\nSacristan\'s adventures in the homeward journey, and added, that for some\r\ntime he was inclined to think his brain was infirm, seeing he had sung,\r\nlaughed, and wept all in the same breath.\r\n\r\n"A wonderful thing it is to us," said the Abbot, "that Satan has been\r\npermitted to put forth his hand thus far on one of our sacred brethren!"\r\n\r\n"True," said Father Eustace; "but for every text there is a paraphrase;\r\nand I have my suspicions, that if the drenching of Father Philip cometh\r\nof the Evil one, yet it may not have been altogether without his own\r\npersonal fault."\r\n\r\n"How!" said the Father Abbot; "I will not believe that thou makest doubt\r\nthat Satan, in former days, hath been permitted to afflict saints and\r\nholy men, even as he afflicted the pious Job?"\r\n\r\n"God forbid I should make question of it," said the monk, crossing\r\nhimself; "yet, where there is an exposition of the Sacristan\'s tale,\r\nwhich is less than miraculous, I hold it safe to consider it at least,\r\nif not to abide by it. Now, this Hob the Miller hath a buxom daughter.\r\nSuppose--I say only suppose--that our Sacristan met her at the ford on\r\nher return from her uncle\'s on the other side, for there she hath this\r\nevening been--suppose, that, in courtesy, and to save her stripping\r\nhose and shoon, the Sacristan brought her across behind him-suppose he\r\ncarried his familiarities farther than the maiden was willing to admit;\r\nand we may easily suppose, farther, that this wetting was the result of\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"And this legend invented to deceive us!" said the Superior, reddening\r\nwith wrath; "but most strictly shall it be sifted and inquired into; it\r\nis not upon us that Father Philip must hope to pass the result of his\r\nown evil practices for doings of Satan. To-morrow cite the wench to\r\nappear before us--we will examine, and we will punish."\r\n\r\n"Under your reverence\'s favour," said Eustace, "that were but poor\r\npolicy. As things now stand with us, the heretics catch hold of each\r\nflying report which tends to the scandal of our clergy. We must abate\r\nthe evil, not only by strengthening discipline, but also by suppressing\r\nand stifling the voice of scandal. If my conjectures are true, the\r\nmiller\'s daughter will be silent for her own sake; and your reverence\'s\r\nauthority may also impose silence on her father, and on the Sacristan.\r\nIf he is again found to afford room for throwing dishonour on his order,\r\nhe can be punished with severity, but at the same time with secrecy. For\r\nwhat say the Decretals! Facinora ostendi dum punientur, flagitia autem\r\nabscondi debent."\r\n\r\nA sentence of Latin, as Eustace had before observed, had often much\r\ninfluence on the Abbot, because he understood it not fluently, and was\r\nashamed to acknowledge his ignorance. On these terms they parted for the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nThe next day, Abbot Boniface strictly interrogated Philip on the real\r\ncause of his disaster of the previous night. But the Sacristan stood\r\nfirm to his story; nor was he found to vary from any point of it,\r\nalthough the answers he returned were in some degree incoherent, owing\r\nto his intermingling with them ever and anon snatches of the strange\r\ndamsel\'s song, which had made such deep impression on his imagination,\r\nthat he could not prevent himself from imitating it repeatedly in the\r\ncourse of his examination. The Abbot had compassion with the Sacristan\'s\r\ninvoluntary frailty, to which something supernatural seemed annexed,\r\nand finally became of opinion, that Father Eustace\'s more natural\r\nexplanation was rather plausible than just. And, indeed, although\r\nwe have recorded the adventure as we find it written down, we cannot\r\nforbear to add that there was a schism on the subject in the convent,\r\nand that several of the brethren pretended to have good reason for\r\nthinking that the miller\'s black-eyed daughter was at the bottom of the\r\naffair after all. Whichever way it might be interpreted, all agreed\r\nthat it had too ludicrous a sound to be permitted to get abroad, and\r\ntherefore the Sacristan was charged, on his vow of obedience, to say no\r\nmore of his ducking; an injunction which, having once eased his mind by\r\ntelling his story, it may be well conjectured that he joyfully obeyed.\r\n\r\nThe attention of Father Eustace was much less forcibly arrested by the\r\nmarvellous tale of the Sacristan\'s danger, and his escape, than by the\r\nmention of the volume which he had brought with him from the Tower of\r\nGlendearg. A copy of the Scriptures, translated into the vulgar tongue,\r\nhad found its way even into the proper territory of the church, and had\r\nbeen discovered in one of the most hidden and sequestered recesses of\r\nthe Halidome of Saint Mary\'s.\r\n\r\nHe anxiously requested to see the volume. In this the Sacristan was\r\nunable to gratify him, for he had lost it, as far as he recollected,\r\nwhen the supernatural being, as he conceived her to be, took her\r\ndeparture from him. Father Eustace went down to the spot in person, and\r\nsearched all around it, in hopes of recovering the volume in question;\r\nbut his labour was in vain. He returned to the Abbot, and reported\r\nthat it must have fallen into the river or the mill-stream; "for I will\r\nhardly believe," he said, "that Father Philip\'s musical friend would fly\r\noff with a copy of the Holy Scriptures."\r\n\r\n"Being," said the Abbot, "as it is, an heretical translation, it may be\r\nthought that Satan may have power over it."\r\n\r\n"Ay!" said Father Eustace, "it is indeed his chiefest magazine of\r\nartillery, when he inspireth presumptuous and daring men to set forth\r\ntheir own opinions and expositions of Holy Writ. But though thus abused,\r\nthe Scriptures are the source of our salvation, and are no more to\r\nbe reckoned unholy, because of these rash men\'s proceedings, than a\r\npowerful medicine is to be contemned, or held poisonous, because bold\r\nand evil leeches have employed it to the prejudice of their patients.\r\nWith the permission of your reverence, I would that this matter were\r\nlooked into more closely. I will myself visit the Tower of Glendearg ere\r\nI am many hours older, and we shall see if any spectre or white woman\r\nof the wild will venture to interrupt my journey or return. Have I your\r\nreverend permission and your blessing?" he added, but in a tone that\r\nappeared to set no great store by either.\r\n\r\n"Thou hast both, my brother," said the Abbot; but no sooner had Eustace\r\nleft the apartment, than Boniface could not help breaking on the willing\r\near of the Sacristan his sincere wish, that any spirit, black, white,\r\nor gray, would read the adviser such a lesson, as to cure him of his\r\npresumption in esteeming himself wiser than the whole community.\r\n\r\n"I wish him no worse lesson," said the Sacristan, "than to go swimming\r\nmerrily down the river with a ghost behind, and Kelpies, night-crows,\r\nand mud-eels, all waiting to have a snatch at him.\r\n\r\n  Merrily swim we, the moon shines bright!\r\n  Good luck to your fishing, whom watch you to-night?"\r\n\r\n"Brother Philip," said the Abbot, "we exhort thee to say thy prayers,\r\ncompose thyself, and banish that foolish chant from thy mind;--it is but\r\na deception of the devil\'s."\r\n\r\n"I will essay, reverend Father," said the Sacristan, "but the tune\r\nhangs by my memory like a bur in a beggar\'s rags; it mingles with the\r\npsalter--the very bells of the convent seem to repeat the words, and\r\njingle to the tune; and were you to put me to death at this very moment,\r\nit is my belief I should die singing it--\'Now swim we merrily\'--it is as\r\nit were a spell upon me."\r\n\r\nHe then again began to warble\r\n\r\n  "Good luck to your fishing."\r\n\r\nAnd checking himself in the strain with difficulty, he exclaimed, "It is\r\ntoo certain--I am but a lost priest! Swim we merrily--I shall sing it at\r\nthe very mass--Wo is me! I shall sing all the remainder of my life, and\r\nyet never be able to change the tune!"\r\n\r\nThe honest Abbot replied, "he knew many a good fellow in the same\r\ncondition;" and concluded the remark with "ho! ho! ho!" for his\r\nreverence, as the reader may partly have observed, was one of those dull\r\nfolks who love a quiet joke.\r\n\r\nThe Sacristan, well acquainted with his Superior\'s humour, endeavoured\r\nto join in the laugh, but his unfortunate canticle came again across his\r\nimagination, and interrupted the hilarity of his customary echo.\r\n\r\n"By the rood, Brother Philip," said the Abbot, much moved, "you become\r\naltogether intolerable! and I am convinced that such a spell could not\r\nsubsist over a person of religion, and in a religious house, unless\r\nhe were under mortal sin. Wherefore, say the seven penitentiary\r\npsalms--make diligent use of thy scourge and hair-cloth--refrain for\r\nthree days from all food, save bread and water--I myself will shrive\r\nthee, and we will see if this singing devil may be driven out of\r\nthee; at least I think Father Eustace himself could devise no better\r\nexorcism."\r\n\r\nThe Sacristan sighed deeply, but knew remonstrance was vain. He retired\r\ntherefore to his cell, to try how far psalmody might be able to drive\r\noff the sounds of the syren tune which haunted his memory.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Father Eustace proceeded to the drawbridge, in his way to the\r\nlonely valley of Glendearg. In a brief conversation with the churlish\r\nwarder, he had the address to render him more tractable in the\r\ncontroversy betwixt him and the convent. He reminded him that his father\r\nhad been a vassal under the community; that his brother was childless;\r\nand that their possession would revert to the church on his death,\r\nand might be either granted to himself the warder, or to some greater\r\nfavourite of the Abbot, as matters chanced to stand betwixt them at the\r\ntime. The Sub-Prior suggested to him also, the necessary connexion of\r\ninterests betwixt the Monastery and the office which this man enjoyed.\r\nHe listened with temper to his rude and churlish answers; and by keeping\r\nhis own interest firm pitched in his view, he had the satisfaction to\r\nfind that Peter gradually softened his tone, and consented to let every\r\npilgrim who travelled upon foot pass free of exaction until Pentocost\r\nnext; they who travelled on horseback or otherwise, contenting to pay\r\nthe ordinary custom. Having thus accommodated a matter in which the weal\r\nof the convent was so deeply interested, Father Eustace proceeded on his\r\njourney.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter the Eighth.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Nay, dally not with time, the wise man\'s treasure,\r\n  Though fools are lavish on\'t--the fatal Fisher\r\n  Hooks souls, while we waste moments.\r\n                                      OLD PLAY.\r\n\r\nA November mist overspread the little valley, up which slowly but\r\nsteadily rode the Monk Eustace. He was not insensible to the feeling of\r\nmelancholy inspired by the scene and by the season. The stream seemed to\r\nmurmur with a deep and oppressed note, as if bewailing the departure\r\nof autumn. Among the scattered copses which here and there fringed its\r\nbanks, the oak-trees only retained that pallid green that precedes their\r\nrusset hue. The leaves of the willows were most of them stripped from\r\nthe branches, lay rustling at each breath, and disturbed by every step\r\nof the mule; while the foliage of other trees, totally withered, kept\r\nstill precarious possession of the boughs, waiting the first wind to\r\nscatter them.\r\n\r\nThe monk dropped into the natural train of pensive thought which these\r\nautumnal emblems of mortal hopes are peculiarly calculated to inspire.\r\n"There," he said, looking at the leaves which lay strewed around, "lie\r\nthe hopes of early youth, first formed that they may soonest wither, and\r\nloveliest in spring to become most contemptible in winter; but you,\r\nye lingerers," he added, looking to a knot of beeches which still bore\r\ntheir withered leaves, "you are the proud plans of adventurous manhood,\r\nformed later, and still clinging to the mind of age, although it\r\nacknowledges their inanity! None lasts--none endures, save the foliage\r\nof the hardy oak, which only begins to show itself when that of the rest\r\nof the forest has enjoyed half its existence. A pale and decayed hue is\r\nall it possesses, but still it retains that symptom of vitality to the\r\nlast.--So be it with Father Eustace! The fairy hopes of my youth I have\r\ntrodden under foot like those neglected rustlers--to the prouder dreams\r\nof my manhood I look back as to lofty chimeras, of which the pith and\r\nessence have long since faded; but my religious vows, the faithful\r\nprofession which I have made in my maturer age, shall retain life while\r\naught of Eustace lives. Dangerous it may be--feeble it must be--yet live\r\nit shall, the proud determination to serve the Church of which I am\r\na member, and to combat the heresies by which she is assailed." Thus\r\nspoke, at least thus thought, a man zealous according to his imperfect\r\nknowledge, confounding the vital interests of Christianity with the\r\nextravagant and usurped claims of the Church of Rome, and defending his\r\ncause with an ardour worthy of a better.\r\n\r\nWhile moving onward in this contemplative mood, he could not help\r\nthinking more than once, that he saw in his path the form of a female\r\ndressed in white, who appeared in the attitude of lamentation. But the\r\nimpression was only momentary, and whenever he looked steadily to the\r\npoint where he conceived the figure appeared, it always proved that\r\nhe had mistaken some natural object, a white crag, or the trunk of a\r\ndecayed birch-tree with its silver bark, for the appearance in question.\r\n\r\nFather Eustace had dwelt too long in Rome to partake the superstitious\r\nfeelings of the more ignorant Scottish clergy; yet he certainly thought\r\nit extraordinary, that so strong an impression should have been made\r\non his mind by the legend of the Sacristan. "It is strange," he said to\r\nhimself, "that this story, which doubtless was the invention of Brother\r\nPhilip to cover his own impropriety of conduct, should run so much in my\r\nhead, and disturb my more serious thoughts--I am wont, I think, to have\r\nmore command over my senses. I will repeat my prayers, and banish such\r\nfolly from my recollection."\r\n\r\nThe monk accordingly began with devotion to tell his beads, in pursuance\r\nof the prescribed rule of his order, and was not again disturbed by any\r\nwanderings of the imagination, until he found himself beneath the little\r\nfortalice of Glendearg.\r\n\r\nDame Glendinning, who stood at the gate, set up a shout of surprise and\r\njoy at seeing the good father. "Martin," she said, "Jasper, where be a\'\r\nthe folk?--help the right reverend Sub-Prior to dismount, and take his\r\nmule from him.--O father! God has sent you in our need--I was just going\r\nto send man and horse to the convent, though I ought to be ashamed to\r\ngive so much trouble to your reverences."\r\n\r\n"Our trouble matters not, good dame," said Father Eustace; "in what can\r\nI pleasure you? I came hither to visit the Lady of Avenel."\r\n\r\n"Well-a-day!" said Dame Alice, "and it was on her part that I had the\r\nboldness to think of summoning you, for the good lady will never be able\r\nto wear over the day!--Would it please you to go to her chamber?"\r\n\r\n"Hath she not been shriven by Father Philip?" said the monk.\r\n\r\n"Shriven she was," said the Dame of Glendearg, "and by Father Philip,\r\nas your reverence truly says--but--I wish it may have been a clean\r\nshrift--Methought Father Philip looked but moody upon it--and there was\r\na book which he took away with him, that--" She paused as if unwilling\r\nto proceed.\r\n\r\n"Speak out, Dame Glendinning," said the Father; "with us it is your duty\r\nto have no secrets."\r\n\r\n"Nay, if it please your reverence, it is not that I would keep anything\r\nfrom your reverence\'s knowledge, but I fear I should prejudice the lady\r\nin your opinion; for she is an excellent lady--months and years has she\r\ndwelt in this tower, and none more exemplary than she; but this matter,\r\ndoubtless, she will explain it herself to your reverence."\r\n\r\n"I desire first to know it from you, Dame Glendinning," said the monk;\r\n"and I again repeat, it is your duty to tell it to me."\r\n\r\n"This book, if it please your reverence, which Father Philip removed\r\nfrom Glendearg, was this morning returned to us in a strange manner,"\r\nsaid the good widow.\r\n\r\n"Returned!" said the monk; "how mean you?"\r\n\r\n"I mean," answered Dame Glendinning, "that it was brought back to the\r\ntower of Glendearg, the saints best know how--that same book which\r\nFather Philip carried with him but yesterday. Old Martin, that is\r\nmy tasker and the lady\'s servant, was driving out the cows to the\r\npasture--for we have three good milk-cows, reverend father, blessed be\r\nSaint Waldave, and thanks to the holy Monastery--"\r\n\r\nThe monk groaned with impatience; but he remembered that a woman of\r\nthe good dame\'s condition was like a top, which, if you let it spin on\r\nuntouched, must at last come to a pause; but, if you interrupt it by\r\nflogging, there is no end to its gyrations. "But, to speak no more of\r\nthe cows, your reverence, though they are likely cattle as ever were\r\ntied to a stake, the tasker was driving them out, and the lads, that\r\nis my Halbert and my Edward, that your reverence has seen at church on\r\nholidays, and especially Halbert,--for you patted him on the head and\r\ngave him a brooch of Saint Cuthbert, which he wears in his bonnet,--and\r\nlittle Mary Avenel, that is the lady\'s daughter, they ran all after the\r\ncattle, and began to play up and down the pasture as young folk will,\r\nyour reverence. And at length they lost sight of Martin and the\r\ncows; and they began to run up a little cleugh which we call\r\n_Corri-nan-Shian_, where there is a wee bit stripe of a burn, and\r\nthey saw there--Good guide us!--a White Woman sitting on the burnside\r\nwringing her hands--so the bairns were frighted to see a strange woman\r\nsitting there, all but Halbert, who will be sixteen come Whitsuntide;\r\nand, besides, he never feared ony thing--and when they went up to\r\nher--behold she was passed away!"\r\n\r\n"For shame, good woman!" said Father Eustace; "a woman of your sense to\r\nlisten to a tale so idle!--the young folk told you a lie, and that was\r\nall."\r\n\r\n"Nay, sir, it was more than that," said the old dame; "for, besides that\r\nthey never told me a lie in their lives, I must warn you that on the\r\nvery ground where the White Woman was sitting, they found the Lady of\r\nAvenel\'s book, and brought it with them to the tower."\r\n\r\n"That is worthy of mark at least," said the monk. "Know you no other\r\ncopy of this volume within these bounds?"\r\n\r\n"None, your reverence," returned Elspeth; "why should there?--no one\r\ncould read it were there twenty."\r\n\r\n"Then you are sure it is the very same volume which you gave to Father\r\nPhilip?" said the monk.\r\n\r\n"As sure as that I now speak with your reverence."\r\n\r\n"It is most singular!" said the monk; and he walked across the room in a\r\nmusing posture.\r\n\r\n"I have been upon nettles to hear what your reverence would say,"\r\ncontinued Dame Glendinning, "respecting this matter--There is nothing\r\nI would not do for the Lady of Avenel and her family, and that has been\r\nproved, and for her servants to boot, both Martin and Tibb, although\r\nTibb is not so civil sometimes as altogether I have a right to expect;\r\nbut I cannot think it beseeming to have angels, or ghosts, or fairies,\r\nor the like, waiting upon a leddy when she is in another woman\'s house,\r\nin respect it is no ways creditable. Ony thing she had to do was always\r\ndone to her hand, without costing her either pains or pence, as a\r\ncountry body says; and besides the discredit, I cannot but think that\r\nthere is no safety in having such unchancy creatures about ane. But I\r\nhave tied red thread round the bairns\'s throats," (so her fondness still\r\ncalled them,) "and given ilka ane of them a riding-wand of rowan-tree,\r\nforby sewing up a slip of witch-elm into their doublets; and I wish to\r\nknow of your reverence if there be ony thing mair that a lone woman can\r\ndo in the matter of ghosts and fairies?--Be here! that I should have\r\nnamed their unlucky names twice ower!"\r\n\r\n"Dame Glendinning," answered the monk, somewhat abruptly, when the good\r\nwoman had finished her narrative, "I pray you, do you know the miller\'s\r\ndaughter?"\r\n\r\n"Did I know Kate Happer?" replied the widow; "as well as the beggar\r\nknows his dish--a canty quean was Kate, and a special cummer of my ain\r\nmaybe twenty years syne."\r\n\r\n"She cannot be the wench I mean," said Father Eustace; "she after whom\r\nI inquire is scarce fifteen, a black-eyed girl--you may have seen her at\r\nthe kirk."\r\n\r\n"Your reverence must be in the right; and she is my cummer\'s nie\'ce,\r\ndoubtless, that you are pleased to speak of: but I thank God I have\r\nalways been too duteous in attention to the mass, to know whether young\r\nwenches have black eyes or green ones."\r\n\r\nThe good father had so much of the world about him, that he was unable\r\nto avoid smiling, when the dame boasted her absolute resistance to a\r\ntemptation, which was not quite so liable to beset her as those of the\r\nother sex.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps, then," he said, "you know her usual dress, Dame Glendinning?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay, father," answered the dame readily enough, "a white kirtle the\r\nwench wears, to hide the dust of the mill, no doubt--and a blue hood,\r\nthat might weel be spared, for pridefulness."\r\n\r\n"Then, may it not be she," said the father, "who has brought back this\r\nbook, and stepped out of the way when the children came near her?"\r\n\r\nThe dame paused--was unwilling to combat the solution suggested by the\r\nmonk--but was at a loss to conceive why the lass of the mill should come\r\nso far from home into so wild a corner merely to leave an old book with\r\nthree children, from whose observation she wished to conceal herself.\r\n\r\nAbove all, she could not understand why, since she had acquaintances in\r\nthe family, and since the Dame Glendinning had always paid her multure\r\nand knaveship duly, the said lass of the mill had not come in to rest\r\nherself and eat a morsel, and tell her the current news of the water.\r\n\r\nThese very objections satisfied the monk that his conjectures were\r\nright. "Dame," he said, "you must be cautious in what you say. This is\r\nan instance--I would it were the sole one--of the power of the Enemy\r\nin these days. The matter must be sifted--with a curious and a careful\r\nhand."\r\n\r\n"Indeed," said Elspeth, trying to catch and chime in with the ideas\r\nof the Sub-Prior, "I have often thought the miller\'s folk at the\r\nMonastery-mill were far over careless in sifting our melder, and in\r\nbolting it too--some folk say they will not stick at whiles to put in a\r\nhandful of ashes amongst Christian folk\'s corn-meal."\r\n\r\n"That shall be looked after also, dame," said the Sub-Prior, not\r\ndispleased to see that the good old woman went off on a false scent;\r\n"and now, by your leave, I will see this lady--do you go before, and\r\nprepare her to see me."\r\n\r\nDame Glendinning left the lower apartment accordingly, which the monk\r\npaced in anxious reflection, considering how he might best discharge,\r\nwith humanity as well as with effect, the important duty imposed on him.\r\nHe resolved to approach the bedside of the sick person with reprimands,\r\nmitigated only by a feeling for her weak condition--he determined, in\r\ncase of her reply, to which late examples of hardened heretics might\r\nencourage her, to be prepared with answers to the customary scruples.\r\nHigh fraught, also, with zeal against her unauthorized intrusion into\r\nthe priestly function, by study of the Sacred Scriptures, he imagined\r\nto himself the answers which one of the modern school of heresy might\r\nreturn to him--the victorious refutation which should lay the disputant\r\nprostrate at the Confessor\'s mercy--and the healing, yet awful\r\nexhortation, which, under pain of refusing the last consolations of\r\nreligion, he designed to make to the penitent, conjuring her, as she\r\nloved her own soul\'s welfare, to disclose to him what she knew of the\r\ndark mystery of iniquity, by which heresies were introduced into the\r\nmost secluded spots of the very patrimony of the Church herself--what\r\nagents they had who could thus glide, as it were unseen, from place to\r\nplace, bring back the volume which the Church had interdicted to the\r\nspots from which it had been removed under her express auspices; and,\r\nwho, by encouraging the daring and profane thirst after knowledge\r\nforbidden and useless to the laity, had encouraged the fisher of souls\r\nto use with effect his old bait of ambition and vain-glory.\r\n\r\nMuch of this premeditated disputation escaped the good father, when\r\nElspeth returned, her tears flowing faster than her apron could dry\r\nthem, and made him a signal to follow her. "How," said the monk, "is she\r\nthen so near her end?--nay, the Church must not break or bruise,\r\nwhen comfort is yet possible;" and forgetting his polemics, the good\r\nSub-Prior hastened to the little apartment, where, on the wretched bed\r\nwhich she had occupied since her misfortunes had driven her to the Tower\r\nof Glendearg, the widow of Walter Avenel had rendered up her spirit\r\nto her Creator. "My God!" said the Sub-Prior, "and has my unfortunate\r\ndallying suffered her to depart without the Church\'s consolation! Look\r\nto her, dame," he exclaimed, with eager impatience; "is there not yet a\r\nsparkle of the life left?--may she not be recalled--recalled but for\r\na moment?--Oh! would that she could express, but by the most imperfect\r\nword--but by the most feeble motion, her acquiescence in the needful\r\ntask of penitential prayer!--Does she not breathe?--Art thou sure she\r\ndoth not?"\r\n\r\n"She will never breathe more," said the matron. "Oh! the poor fatherless\r\ngirl--now motherless also--Oh, the kind companion I have had these many\r\nyears, whom I shall never see again! But she is in heaven for certain,\r\nif ever woman went there; for a woman of better life----"\r\n\r\n"Wo to me," said the good monk, "if indeed she went not hence in good\r\nassurance--wo to the reckless shepherd, who suffered the wolf to carry\r\na choice one from the flock, while he busied himself with trimming\r\nhis sling and his staff to give the monster battle! Oh! if in the long\r\nHereafter, aught but weal should that poor spirit share, what has my\r\ndelay cost?--the value of an immortal soul!"\r\n\r\nHe then approached the body, full of the deep remorse natural to a\r\ngood man of his persuasion, who devoutly believed the doctrines of the\r\nCatholic Church. "Ay," said he, gazing on the pallid corpse, from which\r\nthe spirit had parted so placidly as to leave a smile upon the thin blue\r\nlips, which had been so long wasted by decay that they had parted\r\nwith the last breath of animation without the slightest convulsive\r\ntremor--"Ay," said Father Eustace, "there lies the faded tree, and, as\r\nit fell, so it lies--awful thought for me, should my neglect have left\r\nit to descend in an evil direction!" He then again and again conjured\r\nDame Glendinning to tell him what she knew of the demeanour and ordinary\r\nwalk of the deceased.\r\n\r\nAll tended to the high honour of the deceased lady; for her companion,\r\nwho admired her sufficiently while alive, notwithstanding some trifling\r\npoints of jealousy, now idolized her after her death, and could think of\r\nno attribute of praise with which she did not adorn her memory.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the Lady of Avenel, however she might privately doubt some of\r\nthe doctrines announced by the Church of Rome, and although she had\r\nprobably tacitly appealed from that corrupted system of Christianity\r\nto the volume on which Christianity itself is founded, had nevertheless\r\nbeen regular in her attendance on the worship of the Church, not,\r\nperhaps, extending her scruples so far as to break off communion. Such\r\nindeed was the first sentiment of the earlier reformers, who seemed to\r\nhave studied, for a time at least, to avoid a schism, until the violence\r\nof the Pope rendered it inevitable.\r\n\r\nFather Eustace, on the present occasion, listened with eagerness to\r\neverything which could lead to assure him of the lady\'s orthodoxy in the\r\nmain points of belief; for his conscience reproached him sorely, that,\r\ninstead of protracting conversation with the Dame of Glendearg, he had\r\nnot instantly hastened where his presence was so necessary. "If," he\r\nsaid, addressing the dead body, "thou art yet free from the utmost\r\npenalty due to the followers of false doctrine--if thou dost but suffer\r\nfor a time, to expiate faults done in the body, but partaking of mortal\r\nfrailty more than of deadly sin, fear not that thy abode shall be long\r\nin the penal regions to which thou mayest be doomed--if vigils--if\r\nmasses--if penance--if maceration of my body, till it resembles\r\nthat extenuated form which the soul hath abandoned, may assure thy\r\ndeliverance. The Holy Church--the godly foundation--our blessed\r\nPatroness herself, shall intercede for one whose errors were\r\ncounter-balanced by so many virtues.--Leave me, dame--here, and by her\r\nbed-side, will I perform those duties--which this piteous case demands!"\r\n\r\nElspeth left the monk, who employed himself in fervent and sincere,\r\nthough erroneous prayers, for the weal of the departed spirit. For an\r\nhour he remained in the apartment of death, and then returned to the\r\nhall, where he found the still weeping friend of the deceased.\r\n\r\nBut it would be injustice to Mrs. Glendinning\'s hospitality, if we\r\nsuppose her to have been weeping during this long interval, or rather if\r\nwe suppose her so entirely absorbed by the tribute of sorrow which she\r\npaid frankly and plentifully to her deceased friend, as to be incapable\r\nof attending to the rights of hospitality due to the holy visitor--who\r\nwas confessor at once, and Sub-Prior--mighty in all religious and\r\nsecular considerations, so far as the vassals of the Monastery were\r\ninterested.\r\n\r\nHer barley-bread had been toasted--her choicest cask of home-brewed ale\r\nhad been broached--her best butter had been placed on the hall-table,\r\nalong with her most savoury ham, and her choicest cheese, ere she\r\nabandoned herself to the extremity of sorrow; and it was not till she\r\nhad arranged her little repast neatly on the board, that she sat down in\r\nthe chimney corner, threw her checked apron over her head, and gave\r\nway to the current of tears and sobs. In this there was no grimace\r\nor affectation. The good dame held the honours of her house to be as\r\nessential a duty, especially when a monk was her visitant, as any\r\nother pressing call upon her conscience; nor until these were suitably\r\nattended to did she find herself at liberty to indulge her sorrow for\r\nher departed friend.\r\n\r\nWhen she was conscious of the Sub-Prior\'s presence, she rose with the\r\nsame attention to his reception; but he declined all the offers of\r\nhospitality with which she endeavoured to tempt him. Not her butter,\r\nas yellow as gold, and the best, she assured him, that was made in the\r\npatrimony of St. Mary--not the barley scones, which "the departed saint,\r\nGod sain her! used to say were so good"--not the ale, nor any other\r\ncates which poor Elspeth\'s stores afforded, could prevail on the\r\nSub-Prior to break his fast. "This day," he said, "I must not taste\r\nfood until the sun go down, happy if, in so doing, I can expiate my own\r\nnegligence--happier still, if my sufferings of this trifling nature,\r\nundertaken in pure faith and singleness of heart, may benefit the soul\r\nof the deceased. Yet, dame," he added, "I may not so far forget the\r\nliving in my cares for the dead, as to leave behind me that book, which\r\nis to the ignorant what, to our first parents, the tree of Knowledge\r\nof Good and Evil unhappily proved-excellent indeed in itself, but fatal\r\nbecause used by those to whom it is prohibited."\r\n\r\n"Oh, blithely, reverend father," said the widow of Simon Glendinning,\r\n"will I give you the book, if so be I can while it from the bairns; and\r\nindeed, poor things, as the case stands with them even now, you might\r\ntake the heart out of their bodies, and they never find it out, they are\r\nsae begrutten." [Footnote: _Begrutten_--over-weeped]\r\n\r\n"Give them this missal instead, good dame," said the father, drawing\r\nfrom his pocket one which was curiously illuminated with paintings, "and\r\nI will come myself, or send one at a fitting time, and teach them the\r\nmeaning of these pictures."\r\n\r\n"The bonny images!" said Dame Glendinning, forgetting for an instant\r\nher grief in her admiration, "and weel I wot," added she, "it is another\r\nsort of a book than the poor Lady of Avenel\'s; and blessed might we have\r\nbeen this day, if your reverence had found the way up the glen, instead\r\nof Father Philip, though the Sacristan is a powerful man too, and speaks\r\nas if he would ger the house fly abroad, save that the walls are gey\r\nthick. Simon\'s forebears (may he and they be blessed!) took care of\r\nthat."\r\n\r\nThe monk ordered his mule, and was about to take his leave; and the good\r\ndame was still delaying him with questions about the funeral, when a\r\nhorseman, armed and accoutred, rode into the little court-yard which\r\nsurrounded the Keep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter the Ninth.\r\n\r\n\r\n  For since they rode among our doors\r\n  With splent on spauld and rusty spurs,\r\n  There grows no fruit into our furs;\r\n    Thus said John Up-on-land.\r\n                       DANNATYNE MS.\r\n\r\nThe Scottish laws, which were as wisely and judiciously made as they\r\nwere carelessly and ineffectually executed, had in vain endeavoured\r\nto restrain the damage done to agriculture, by the chiefs and landed\r\nproprietors retaining in their service what were called jack-men, from\r\nthe _jack_, or doublet, quilted with iron which they wore as defensive\r\narmour. These military retainers conducted themselves with great\r\ninsolence towards the industrious part of the community--lived in a\r\ngreat measure by plunder, and were ready to execute any commands of\r\ntheir master, however unlawful. In adopting this mode of life, men\r\nresigned the quiet hopes and regular labours of industry, for an\r\nunsettled, precarious, and dangerous trade, which yet had such charms\r\nfor those once accustomed to it, that they became incapable of following\r\nany other. Hence the complaint of John Upland, a fictitious character,\r\nrepresenting a countryman, into whose mouth the poets of the day put\r\ntheir general satires upon men and manners.\r\n\r\n  They ride about in such a rage,\r\n  By forest, frith, and field,\r\n    With buckler, bow, and brand.\r\n  Lo! where they ride out through the rye!\r\n  The Devil mot save the company,\r\n    Quoth John Up-on-land.\r\n\r\nChristie of the Clinthill, the horseman who now arrived at the little\r\nTower of Glendearg, was one of the hopeful company of whom the poet\r\ncomplains, as was indicated by his "splent on spauld," (iron-plates on\r\nhis shoulder,) his rusted spurs, and his long lance. An iron skull-cap,\r\nnone of the brightest, bore for distinction a sprig of the holly, which\r\nwas Avenel\'s badge. A long two-edged straight sword, having a handle\r\nmade of polished oak, hung down by his side. The meagre condition of\r\nhis horse, and the wild and emaciated look of the rider, showed their\r\noccupation could not be accounted an easy or a thriving one. He saluted\r\nDame Glendinning with little courtesy, and the monk with less; for the\r\ngrowing, disrespect to the religious orders had not failed to extend\r\nitself among a class of men of such disorderly habits, although it may\r\nbe supposed they were tolerably indifferent alike to the new or the\r\nancient doctrines.\r\n\r\n"So, our lady is dead, Dame Glendinning?" said the jack-man; "my master\r\nhas sent you even now a fat bullock for her mart--it may serve for\r\nher funeral. I have left him in the upper cleugh, as he is somewhat\r\nkenspeckle, [Footnote: _Kenspeckle_--that which is easily recognized\r\nby the eye.] and is marked both with cut and birn--the sooner the\r\nskin is off, and he is in saultfat, the less like you are to have\r\ntrouble--you understand me? Let me have a peck of corn for my horse, and\r\nbeef and beer for myself, for I must go on to the Monastery--though I\r\nthink this monk hero might do mine errand."\r\n\r\n"Thine errand, rude man!" said the Sub-Prior, knitting his brows--\r\n\r\n"For God\'s sake" cried poor Dame Glendinning, terrified at the idea of\r\na quarrel between them,--"O Christie!---it is the Sub-Prior--O reverend\r\nsir, it is Christie of the Clinthill, the laird\'s chief jack-man; ye\r\nknow that little havings can be expected from the like o\' them."\r\n\r\n"Are you a retainer of the Laird of Avenel?" said the monk, addressing\r\nhimself to the horseman, "and do you speak thus rudely to a Brother of\r\nSaint Mary\'s, to whom thy master is so much beholden?"\r\n\r\n"He means to be yet more beholden to your house, Sir Monk," answered the\r\nfellow; "for hearing his sister-in-law, the widow of Walter of Avenel,\r\nwas on her death-bed, he sent me to say to the Father Abbot and the\r\nbrethren, that he will hold the funeral-feast at their convent, and\r\ninvites himself thereto, with a score of horse and some friends, and\r\nto abide there for three days and three nights,--having horse-meat and\r\nmen\'s-meat at the charge of the community; of which his intention he\r\nsends due notice, that fitting preparation may be timeously made."\r\n\r\n"Friend," said the Sub-Prior, "believe not that I will do to the Father\r\nAbbot the indignity of delivering such an errand.--Think\'st thou the\r\ngoods of the church were bestowed upon her by holy princes and pious\r\nnobles, now dead and gone, to be consumed in revelry by every profligate\r\nlayman who numbers in his train more followers than he can support\r\nby honest means, or by his own incomings? Tell thy master, from the\r\nSub-Prior of Saint Mary\'s, that the Primate hath issued his commands to\r\nus that we submit no longer to this compulsory exaction of hospitality\r\non slight or false pretences. Our lands and goods were given to relieve\r\npilgrims and pious persons, not to feast bands of rude soldiers."\r\n\r\n"This to me!" said the angry spearman, "this to me and to my\r\nmaster--Look to yourself then, Sir Priest, and try if _Ave_ and _Credo_\r\nwill keep bullocks from wandering, and hay-stacks from burning."\r\n\r\n"Dost thou menace the Holy Church\'s patrimony with waste and\r\nfire-raising," said the Sub-Prior, "and that in the face of the sun? I\r\ncall on all who hear me to bear witness to the words this ruffian has\r\nspoken. Remember how the Lord James drowned such as you by scores in the\r\nblack pool at Jeddart.-To him and to the Primate will I complain." The\r\nsoldier shifted the position of his lance, and brought it down to a\r\nlevel with the monk\'s body.\r\n\r\nDame Glendinning began to shriek for assistance. "Tibb Tacket! Martin!\r\nwhere be ye all?--Christie, for the love of God, consider he is a man of\r\nHoly Kirk!"\r\n\r\n"I care not for his spear," said the Sub-Prior; "if I am slain in\r\ndefending the rights and privileges of my community, the Primate will\r\nknow how to take vengeance."\r\n\r\n"Let him look to himself," said Christie, but at the same time\r\ndepositing his lance against the wall of the tower; "if the Fife men\r\nspoke true who came hither with the Governor in the last raid, Norman\r\nLeslie has him at feud, and is like to set him hard. We know Norman a\r\ntrue bloodhound, who will never quit the slot. But I had no design to\r\noffend the holy father," he added, thinking perhaps he had gone a little\r\ntoo far; "I am a rude man, bred to lance and stirrup, and not used to\r\ndeal with book-learned men and priests; and I am willing to ask his\r\nforgiveness--and his blessing, if I have said aught amiss."\r\n\r\n"For God\'s sake! your reverence," said the widow of Glendearg apart to\r\nthe Sub-Prior, "bestow on him your forgiveness--how shall we poor folk\r\nsleep in security in the dark nights, if the convent is at feud with\r\nsuch men as he is?"\r\n\r\n"You are right, dame," said the Sub-Prior, "your safety should, and must\r\nbe, in the first instance consulted.--Soldier, I forgive thee, and may\r\nGod bless thee and send thee honesty."\r\n\r\nChristie of the Clinthill made an unwilling inclination with his\r\nhead, and muttered apart, "that is as much as to say, God send thee\r\nstarvation, But now to my master\'s demand, Sir Priest? What answer am I\r\nto return?"\r\n\r\n"That the body of the widow of Walter of Avenel," answered the Father,\r\n"shall be interred as becomes her rank, and in the tomb of her valiant\r\nhusband. For your master\'s proffered visit of three days, with such\r\na company and retinue, I have no authority to reply to it; you must\r\nintimate your Chief\'s purpose to the Reverend Lord Abbot."\r\n\r\n"That will cost me a farther ride," said the man, "but it is all in the\r\nday\'s work.--How now, my lad," said he to Halbert, who was handling\r\nthe long lance which he had laid aside; "how do you like such a\r\nplaything?--will you go with me and be a moss-trooper?"\r\n\r\n"The Saints in their mercy forbid!" said the poor mother; and then,\r\nafraid of having displeased Christie by the vivacity of her exclamation,\r\nshe followed it up by explaining, that since Simon\'s death she could\r\nnot look on a spear or a bow, or any implement of destruction without\r\ntrembling.\r\n\r\n"Pshaw!" answered Christie, "thou shouldst take another husband, dame,\r\nand drive such follies out of thy thoughts--what sayst thou to such a\r\nstrapping lad as I? Why, this old tower of thine is fensible enough, and\r\nthere is no want of clenchs, and crags, and bogs, and thickets, if one\r\nwas set hard; a man might bide here and keep his half-score of lads, and\r\nas many geldings, and live on what he could lay his hand on, and be kind\r\nto thee, old wench."\r\n\r\n"Alas! Master Christie," said the matron, "that you should talk to a\r\nlone woman in such a fashion, and death in the house besides!"\r\n\r\n"Lone woman!--why, that is the very reason thou shouldst take a mate.\r\nThy old friend is dead, why, good--choose thou another of somewhat\r\ntougher frame, and that will not die of the pip like a young\r\nchicken.--Better still--Come, dame, let me have something to eat, and we\r\nwill talk more of this."\r\n\r\nDame Elspeth, though she well knew the character of the man, whom in\r\nfact she both disliked and feared, could not help simpering at the\r\npersonal address which he thought proper to make to her. She whispered\r\nto the Sub-Prior, "ony thing just to keep him quiet," and went into the\r\ntower to set before the soldier the food he desired, trusting betwixt\r\ngood cheer and the power of her own charms, to keep Christie of the\r\nClinthill so well amused, that the altercation betwixt him and the holy\r\nfather should not be renewed.\r\n\r\nThe Sub-Prior was equally unwilling to hazard any unnecessary rupture\r\nbetween the community and such a person as Julian of Avenel. He was\r\nsensible that moderation, as well as firmness, was necessary to support\r\nthe tottering cause of the Church of Rome; and that, contrary to former\r\ntimes, the quarrels betwixt the clergy and laity had, in the present,\r\nusually terminated to the advantage of the latter. He resolved,\r\ntherefore, to avoid farther strife by withdrawing, but failed not, in\r\nthe first place, to possess himself of the volume which the Sacristan\r\ncarried off the evening before, and which had been returned to the glen\r\nin such a marvellous manner.\r\n\r\nEdward, the younger of Dame Elspeth\'s boys, made great objections to the\r\nbook\'s being removed, in which Mary would probably have joined, but that\r\nshe was now in her little sleeping-chamber with Tibb, who was exerting\r\nher simple skill to console the young lady for her mother\'s death. But\r\nthe younger Glendinning stood up in defence of her property, and, with a\r\npositiveness which had hitherto made no part of his character, declared,\r\nthat now the kind lady was dead, the book was Mary\'s, and no one but\r\nMary should have it.\r\n\r\n"But if it is not a fit book for Mary to read, my dear boy," said the\r\nfather, gently, "you would not wish it to remain with her?"\r\n\r\n"The lady read it," answered the young champion of property; "and so it\r\ncould not be wrong--it shall not be taken away.--I wonder where Halbert\r\nis?--listening to the bravading tales of gay Christie, I reckon,--he is\r\nalways wishing for fighting, and now he is out of the way."\r\n\r\n"Why, Edward, you would not fight with me, who am both a priest and old\r\nman?"\r\n\r\n"If you were as good a priest as the Pope," said the boy, "and as old\r\nas the hills to boot, you shall not carry away Mary\'s book without her\r\nleave. I will do battle for it."\r\n\r\n"But see you, my love," said the monk, amused with the resolute\r\nfriendship manifested by the boy, "I do not take it; I only borrow it;\r\nand I leave in its place my own gay missal, as a pledge I will bring it\r\nagain."\r\n\r\nEdward opened the missal with eager curiosity, and glanced at\r\nthe pictures with which it was illustrated. "Saint George and the\r\ndragon--Halbert will like that; and Saint Michael brandishing his sword\r\nover the head of the Wicked One--and that will do for Halbert too. And\r\nsee the Saint John leading his lamb in the wilderness, with his\r\nlittle cross made of reeds, and his scrip and staff--that shall be\r\nmy favourite; and where shall we find one for poor Mary?--here is a\r\nbeautiful woman weeping and lamenting herself."\r\n\r\n"This is Saint Mary Magdalen repenting of her sins, my dear boy," said\r\nthe father.\r\n\r\n"That will not suit _our_ Mary; for she commits no faults, and is never\r\nangry with us, but when we do something wrong."\r\n\r\n"Then," said the father, "I will show you a Mary, who will protect her\r\nand you, and all good children. See how fairly she is represented, with\r\nher gown covered with golden stars."\r\n\r\nThe boy was lost in wonder at the portrait of the Virgin, which the\r\nSub-Prior turned up to him.\r\n\r\n"This," he said, "is really like our sweet Mary; and I think I will let\r\nyou take away the black book, that has no such goodly shows in it, and\r\nleave this for Mary instead. But you must promise to bring back the\r\nbook, good father--for now I think upon it, Mary may like that best\r\nwhich was her mother\'s."\r\n\r\n"I will certainly return," said the monk, evading his answer, "and\r\nperhaps I may teach you to write and read such beautiful letters as you\r\nsee there written, and to paint them blue, green, and yellow, and to\r\nblazon them with gold."\r\n\r\n"Ay, and to make such figures as these blessed Saints, and especially\r\nthese two Marys?" said the boy.\r\n\r\n"With their blessing," said the Sub-Prior, "I can teach you that art\r\ntoo, so far as I am myself capable of showing, and you of learning it."\r\n"Then," said Edward, "will I paint Mary\'s picture--and remember you are\r\nto bring back the black book; that you must promise me."\r\n\r\nThe Sub-Prior, anxious to get rid of the boy\'s pertinacity, and to\r\nset forward on his return to the convent, without having any further\r\ninterview with Christie the galloper, answered by giving the promise\r\nEdward required, mounted his mule, and set forth on his return homeward.\r\n\r\nThe November day was well spent ere the Sub-Prior resumed his journey;\r\nfor the difficulty of the road, and the various delays which he had met\r\nwith at the tower, had detained him longer than he proposed. A chill\r\neasterly wind was sighing among the withered leaves, and stripping them\r\nfrom the hold they had yet retained on the parent trees.\r\n\r\n"Even so," said the monk, "our prospects in this vale of time grow more\r\ndisconsolate as the stream of years passes on. Little have I gained by\r\nmy journey, saving the certainty that heresy is busy among us with more\r\nthan his usual activity, and that the spirit of insulting religious\r\norders, and plundering the Church\'s property, so general in the eastern\r\ndistricts of Scotland, has now come nearer home."\r\n\r\nThe tread of a horse which came up behind him, interrupted his reverie,\r\nand he soon saw he was mounted by the same wild rider whom he had left\r\nat the tower.\r\n\r\n"Good even, my son, and benedicite," said the Sub-Prior as he passed;\r\nbut the rude soldier scarce acknowledged the greeting, by bending his\r\nhead; and dashing the spurs into his horse, went on at a pace which soon\r\nleft the monk and his mule far behind. And there, thought the Sub-Prior,\r\ngoes another plague of the times--a fellow whose birth designed him\r\nto cultivate the earth, but who is perverted by the unhallowed and\r\nunchristian divisions of the country, into a daring and dissolute\r\nrobber. The barons of Scotland are now turned masterful thieves and\r\nruffians, oppressing the poor by violence, and wasting the Church, by\r\nextorting free-quarters from abbeys and priories, without either shame\r\nor reason. I fear me I shall be too late to counsel the Abbot to make a\r\nstand against these daring _sorners_ [Footnote: To _sorne_, in Scotland,\r\nis to exact free quarters against the will of the landlord. It is\r\ndeclared equivalent to theft, by a statute passed in the year 1445. The\r\ngreat chieftains oppressed the monasteries very much by exactions of\r\nthis nature. The community of Aberbrothwick complained of an Earl of\r\nAngus, I think, who was in the regular habit of visiting them once\r\na year, with a train of a thousand horse, and abiding till the whole\r\nwinter provisions of the convent were exhausted.]--"I must make haste."\r\nHe struck his mule with his riding wand accordingly; but, instead of\r\nmending her pace, the animal suddenly started from the path, and the\r\nrider\'s utmost efforts could not force her forward.\r\n\r\n"Art thou, too, infected with the spirit of the times?" said the\r\nSub-Prior; "thou wert wont to be ready and serviceable, and art now as\r\nrestive as any wild jack-man or stubborn heretic of them all."\r\n\r\nWhile he was contending with the startled animal, a voice, like that of\r\na female, chanted in his ear, or at least very close to it,\r\n\r\n "Good evening-. Sir Priest, and so late as you ride,\r\n  With your mule so fair, and your mantle so wide;\r\n  But ride you through valley, or ride you o\'er hill.\r\n  There is one that has warrant to wait on you still.\r\n               Back, back,\r\n               The volume black!\r\n  I have a warrant to carry it back."\r\n\r\nThe Sub-Prior looked around, but neither bush nor brake was near which\r\ncould conceal an ambushed songstress. "May Our Lady have mercy on me!"\r\nhe said; "I trust my senses have not forsaken me--yet how my thoughts\r\nshould arrange themselves into rhymes which I despise, and music which\r\nI care not for, or why there should be the sound of a female voice\r\nin ears, in which its melody has been so long indifferent, baffles my\r\ncomprehension, and almost realizes the vision of Philip the Sacristan.\r\nCome, good mule, betake thee to the path, and let us hence while our\r\njudgment serves us."\r\n\r\nBut the mule stood as if it had been rooted to the spot, backed from the\r\npoint to which it was pressed by its rider, and by her ears laid\r\nclose into her neck, and her eyes almost starting from their sockets,\r\ntestified that she was under great terror.\r\n\r\nWhile the Sub-Prior, by alternate threats and soothing, endeavoured to\r\nreclaim the wayward animal to her duty, the wild musical voice was again\r\nheard close beside him.\r\n\r\n  "What, ho! Sub-Prior, and came you but here\r\n  To conjure a book from a dead woman\'s bier?\r\n  Sain you, and save you, be wary and wise,\r\n  Ride back with the book, or you\'ll pay for your prize.\r\n               Back, back.\r\n               There\'s death in the track!\r\n  In the name of my master I bid thee bear back."\r\n\r\n"In the name of MY Master," said the astonished monk, "that name before\r\nwhich all things created tremble, I conjure thee to say what thou art\r\nthat hauntest me thus?"\r\n\r\nThe same voice replied,\r\n\r\n  "That which is neither ill nor well.\r\n  That which belongs not to Heaven nor to hell,\r\n  A wreath of the mist, a bubble of the stream,\r\n  \'Twixt a waking thought and a sleeping dream;\r\n               A form that men spy\r\n               With the half-shut eye.\r\n  In the beams of the setting sun, am I."\r\n\r\n"This is more than simple fantasy," said the Sub-Prior, rousing himself;\r\nthough, notwithstanding the natural hardihood of his temper, the\r\nsensible presence of a supernatural being so near him, failed not to\r\nmake his blood run cold, and his hair bristle. "I charge thee," he said\r\naloud, "be thine errand what it will, to depart and trouble me no\r\nmore! False spirit, thou canst not appal any save those who do the work\r\nnegligently." The voice immediately answered:\r\n\r\n  "Vainly, Sir Prior, wouldst thou bar me my right!\r\n  Like the star when it shoots, I can dart through the night;\r\n  I can dance on the torrent and ride on the air,\r\n  And travel the world with the bonny night-mare.\r\n                 Again, again,\r\n                At the crook of the glen,\r\n  Where bickers the burnie, I\'ll meet thee again."\r\n\r\nThe road was now apparently left open; for the mule collected herself,\r\nand changed from her posture of terror to one which promised advance,\r\nalthough a profuse perspiration, and general trembling of the joints,\r\nindicated the bodily terror she had undergone.\r\n\r\n"I used to doubt the existence of Cabalists and Rosicrucians," thought\r\nthe Sub-Prior, "but, by my Holy Order, I know no longer what to say!--My\r\npulse beats temperately--my hand is cool--I am fasting from everything\r\nbut sin, and possessed of my ordinary faculties--Either some fiend is\r\npermitted to bewilder me, or the tales of Cornelius Agrippa,\r\nParacelsus, and others who treat of occult philosophy, are not without\r\nfoundation.--At the crook of the glen? I could have desired to avoid a\r\nsecond meeting, but I am on the service of the Church, and the gates of\r\nhell shall not prevail against me."\r\n\r\nHe moved around accordingly, but with precaution, and not without fear;\r\nfor he neither knew the manner in which, or the place where his journey\r\nmight be next interrupted by his invisible attendant. He descended the\r\nglen without interruption for about a mile farther, when, just at the\r\nspot where the brook approached the steep hill, with a winding so\r\nabrupt as to leave scarcely room for a horse to pass, the mule was again\r\nvisited with the same symptoms of terror which had before interrupted\r\nher course. Better acquainted than before with the cause of her\r\nrestiveness, the Priest employed no effort to make her proceed, but\r\naddressed himself to the object, which he doubted not was the same that\r\nhad formerly interrupted him, in the words of solemn exorcism prescribed\r\nby the Church of Rome on such occasions.\r\n\r\nIn reply to his demand, the voice again sung;--\r\n\r\n  "Men of good are bold as sackless,[Footnote: Sackless--Innocent.]\r\n  Men of rude are wild and reckless,\r\n      Lie thou still\r\n      In the nook of the hill.\r\n  For those be before thee that wish thee ill."\r\n\r\nWhile the Sub-Prior listened, with his head turned in the direction from\r\nwhich the sounds seemed to come, he felt as if something rushed against\r\nhim; and ere he could discover the cause, he was pushed from his saddle\r\nwith gentle but irresistible force. Before he reached the ground his\r\nsenses were gone, and he lay long in a state of insensibility; for\r\nthe sunset had not ceased to gild the top of the distant hill when he\r\nfell,--and when he again became conscious of existence, the pale moon\r\nwas gleaming on the landscape. He awakened in a state of terror, from\r\nwhich, for a few minutes, he found it difficult to shake himself free.\r\nAt length he sate upon the grass, and became sensible, by repeated\r\nexertion, that the only personal injury which he had sustained was the\r\nnumbness arising from extreme cold. The motion of something near him\r\nmade the blood again run to his heart, and by a sudden effort he started\r\nup, and, looking around, saw to his relief that the noise was occasioned\r\nby the footsteps of his own mule. The peaceable animal had remained\r\nquietly beside her master during his trance, browsing on the grass which\r\ngrew plentifully in that sequestered nook.\r\n\r\nWith some exertion he collected himself, remounted the animal, and\r\nmeditating upon his wild adventure, descended the glen till its junction\r\nwith the broader valley through which the Tweed winds. The drawbridge\r\nwas readily dropped at his first summons; and so much had he won upon\r\nthe heart of the churlish warden, that Peter appeared himself with a\r\nlantern to show the Sub-Prior his way over the perilous pass.\r\n\r\n"By my sooth, sir," he said, holding the light up to Father Eustace\'s\r\nface, "you look sorely travelled and deadly pale--but a little matter\r\nserves to weary out you men of the cell. I now who speak to you--I have\r\nridden--before I was perched up here on this pillar betwixt wind and\r\nwater--it may be thirty Scots miles before I broke my fast, and have had\r\nthe red of a bramble rose in my cheek all the while--But will you taste\r\nsome food, or a cup of distilled waters?"\r\n\r\n"I may not," said Father Eustace, "being under a vow; but I thank you\r\nfor your kindness, and pray you to give what I may not accept to the\r\nnext poor pilgrim who comes hither pale and fainting, for so it shall be\r\nthe better both with him here, and with you hereafter."\r\n\r\n"By my faith, and I will do so," said Peter Bridge-Ward, "even for thy\r\nsake--It is strange now, how this Sub-Prior gets round one\'s heart more\r\nthan the rest of these cowled gentry, that think of nothing but quaffing\r\nand stuffing!--Wife, I say--wife, we will give a cup of distilled waters\r\nand a crust of bread unto the next pilgrim that comes over; and ye may\r\nkeep for [Footnote: An old-fashioned name for an earthen jar for\r\nholding spirits.] the purpose the grunds of the last greybeard, and the\r\nill-baked bannock which the bairns couldna eat."\r\n\r\nWhile Peter issued these charitable, and, at the same time, prudent\r\ninjunctions, the Sub-Prior, whose mild interference had awakened the\r\nBridge-Ward to such an act of unwonted generosity, was pacing onward\r\nto the Monastery. In the way, he had to commune with and subdue his own\r\nrebellious heart, an enemy, he was sensible, more formidable than any\r\nwhich the external powers of Satan could place in his way.\r\n\r\nFather Eustace had indeed strong temptation to suppress the\r\nextraordinary incident which had befallen him, which he was the more\r\nreluctant to confess, because he had passed so severe a judgment upon\r\nFather Philip, who, as he was not unwilling to allow, had, on his return\r\nfrom Glendearg, encountered obstacles somewhat similar to his own. Of\r\nthis the Sub-Prior was the more convinced, when, feeling in his bosom\r\nfor the Book which he had brought off from the Tower of Glendearg, he\r\nfound it was amissing, which he could only account for by supposing it\r\nhad been stolen from him during his trance.\r\n\r\n"If I confess this strange visitation," thought the Sub-Prior, "I become\r\nthe ridicule of all my brethren--I whom the Primate sent hither to be a\r\nwatch, as it were, and a check upon their follies. I give the Abbot an\r\nadvantage over me which I shall never again recover, and Heaven only\r\nknows how he may abuse it, in his foolish simplicity, to the dishonour\r\nand loss of Holy Kirk.--But then, if I make not true confession of\r\nmy shame, with what face can I again presume to admonish or restrain\r\nothers?--Avow, proud heart," continued he, addressing himself, "that the\r\nweal of Holy Church interests thee less in this matter than thine own\r\nhumiliation--Yes, Heaven has punished thee even in that point in which\r\nthou didst deem thyself most strong, in thy spiritual pride and thy\r\ncarnal wisdom. Thou hast laughed at and derided the inexperience of thy\r\nbrethren--stoop thyself in turn to their derision--tell what they\r\nmay not believe--affirm that which they will ascribe to idle fear, or\r\nperhaps to idle falsehood--sustain the disgrace of a silly visionary,\r\nor a wilful deceiver.--Be it so, I will do my duty, and make ample\r\nconfession to my Superior. If the discharge of this duty destroys my\r\nusefulness in this house, God and Our Lady will send me where I can\r\nbetter serve them."\r\n\r\nThere was no little merit in the resolution thus piously and generously\r\nformed by Father Eustace. To men of any rank the esteem of their order\r\nis naturally most dear; but in the monastic establishment, cut off, as\r\nthe brethren are, from other objects of ambition, as well as from all\r\nexterior friendship and relationship, the place which they hold in the\r\nopinion of each other is all in all.\r\n\r\nBut the consciousness how much he should rejoice the Abbot and most of\r\nthe other monks of Saint Mary\'s, who were impatient of the unauthorized,\r\nyet irresistible control, which he was wont to exercise in the affairs\r\nof the convent, by a confession which would put him in a ludicrous, or\r\nperhaps even in a criminal point of view, could not weigh with Father\r\nEustace in comparison with the task which his belief enjoined.\r\n\r\nAs, strong in his feelings of duty, he approached the exterior gate\r\nof the Monastery, he was surprised to see torches gleaming, and men\r\nassembled around it, some on horseback, some on foot, while several of\r\nthe monks, distinguished through the night by their white scapularies,\r\nwere making themselves busy among the crowd. The Sub-Prior was received\r\nwith a unanimous shout of joy, which at once made him sensible that he\r\nhad himself been the object of their anxiety.\r\n\r\n"There he is! there he is! God be thanked--there he is, hale and\r\nfear!" exclaimed the vassals; while the monks exclaimed, "_Te Deum\r\nlaudamus_--the blood of thy servants is precious in thy sight!"\r\n\r\n"What is the matter, children? what is the matter, my brethren?" said\r\nFather Eustace, dismounting at the gate.\r\n\r\n"Nay, brother, if thou know\'st not, we will not tell thee till thou art\r\nin the refectory," answered the monks; "suffice it that the Lord Abbot\r\nhad ordered these, our zealous and faithful vassals, instantly to set\r\nforth to guard thee from imminent peril--Ye may ungirth your horses,\r\nchildren, and dismiss; and to-morrow, each who was at this rendezvous\r\nmay send to the convent kitchen for a quarter of a yard of roast beef,\r\nand a black-jack full of double ale." [Footnote: It was one of the few\r\nreminiscences of Old Parr, or Henry Jenkins, I forget which, that, at\r\nsome convent in the veteran\'s neighbourhood, the community, before the\r\ndissolution, used to dole out roast-beef in the measure of feet and\r\nyards.]\r\n\r\nThe vassals dispersed with joyful acclamation, and the monks, with equal\r\njubilee, conducted the Sub-Prior into the refectory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter the Tenth.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Here we stand--\r\n  Woundless and well, may Heaven\'s high name be bless\'d for\'t!\r\n  As erst, ere treason couch\'d a lance against us.\r\n                                                  Decker.\r\n\r\nNo sooner was the Sub-Prior hurried into the refectory by his rejoicing\r\ncompanions, than the first person on whom he fixed his eye proved to be\r\nChristie of the Clinthill. He was seated in the chimney-corner, fettered\r\nand guarded, his features drawn into that air of sulky and turbid\r\nresolution with which those hardened in guilt are accustomed to view the\r\napproach of punishment. But as the Sub-Prior drew near to him, his face\r\nassumed a more wild and startled expression, while he exclaimed--"The\r\ndevil! the devil himself, brings the dead back upon the living."\r\n\r\n"Nay," said a monk to him, "say rather that Our Lady foils the attempts\r\nof the wicked on her faithful servants--our dear brother lives and\r\nmoves."\r\n\r\n"Lives and moves!" said the ruffian, rising and shuffling towards the\r\nSub-Prior as well as his chains would permit; "nay, then, I will never\r\ntrust ashen shaft and steel point more--It is even so," he added, as he\r\ngazed on the Sub-Prior with astonishment; "neither wem nor wound--not as\r\nmuch as a rent in his frock!"\r\n\r\n"And whence should my wound have come?" said Father Eustace.\r\n\r\n"From the good lance that never failed me before," replied Christie of\r\nthe Clinthill.\r\n\r\n"Heaven absolve thee for thy purpose!" said the Sub-Prior; "wouldst thou\r\nhave slain a servant of the altar?"\r\n\r\n"To choose!" answered Christie; "the Fifemen say, an the whole pack of\r\nye were slain, there were more lost at Flodden."\r\n\r\n"Villain! art thou heretic as well as murderer?"\r\n\r\n"Not I, by Saint Giles," replied the rider; "I listened blithely enough\r\nto the Laird of Monance, when he told me ye were all cheats and knaves;\r\nbut when he would have had me go hear one Wiseheart, a gospeller as they\r\ncall him, he might as well have persuaded the wild colt that had flung\r\none rider to kneel down and help another into the saddle."\r\n\r\n"There is some goodness about him yet," said the Sacristan to the Abbot,\r\nwho at that moment entered--"He refused to hear a heretic preacher."\r\n\r\n"The better for him in the next world," answered the Abbot. "Prepare for\r\ndeath, my son,--we deliver thee over to the secular arm of our bailie,\r\nfor execution on the Gallow-hill by peep of light."\r\n\r\n"Amen!" said the ruffian; "\'tis the end I must have come by sooner or\r\nlater--and what care I whether I feed the crows at Saint Mary\'s or at\r\nCarlisle?"\r\n\r\n"Let me implore your reverend patience for an instant," said the\r\nSub-Prior; "until I shall inquire--"\r\n\r\n"What!" exclaimed the Abbot, observing him for the first time--"Our dear\r\nbrother restored to us when his life was unhoped for!--nay, kneel not\r\nto a sinner like me--stand up--thou hast my blessing. When this villain\r\ncame to the gate, accused by his own evil conscience, and crying out\r\nhe had murdered thee, I thought that the pillar of our main aisle had\r\nfallen--no more shall a life so precious be exposed to such risks as\r\noccur in this border country; no longer shall one beloved and rescued\r\nof Heaven hold so low a station in the church as that of a poor\r\nSub-Prior--I will write by express to the Primate for thy speedy removal\r\nand advancement."\r\n\r\n"Nay, but let me understand," said the Sub-Prior; "did this soldier say\r\nhe had slain me?"\r\n\r\n"That he had transfixed you," answered the Abbot, "in full career with\r\nhis lance--but it seems he had taken an indifferent aim. But no sooner\r\ndidst thou fall to the ground mortally gored, as he deemed, with his\r\nweapon, than our blessed Patroness appeared to him, as he averred--"\r\n\r\n"I averred no such thing," said the prisoner; "I said a woman in white\r\ninterrupted me, as I was about to examine the priest\'s cassock, for they\r\nare usually well lined--she had a bulrush in her hand, with one touch\r\nof which she struck me from my horse, as I might strike down a child of\r\nfour years old with an iron mace--and then, like a singing fiend as she\r\nwas, she sung to me.\r\n\r\n  \'Thank the holly-bush\r\n    That nods on thy brow;\r\n  Or with this slender rush\r\n    I had strangled thee now.\'\r\n\r\nI gathered myself up with fear and difficulty, threw myself on my horse,\r\nand came hither like a fool to get myself hanged for a rogue."\r\n\r\n"Thou seest, honoured brother," said the Abbot to the Sub-Prior, "in\r\nwhat favour thou art with our blessed Patroness, that she herself\r\nbecomes the guardian of thy paths--Not since the days of our blessed\r\nfounder hath she shown such grace to any one. All unworthy were we to\r\nhold spiritual superiority over thee, and we pray thee to prepare for\r\nthy speedy removal to Aberbrothwick."\r\n\r\n"Alas! my lord and father," said the Sub-Prior, "your words pierce my\r\nvery soul. Under the seal of confession will I presently tell thee why\r\nI conceive myself rather the baffled sport of a spirit of another sort,\r\nthan the protected favourite of the heavenly powers. But first let me\r\nask this unhappy man a question or two."\r\n\r\n"Do as ye list," replied the Abbot--"but you shall not convince me that\r\nit is fitting you remain in this inferior office in the convent of Saint\r\nMary."\r\n\r\n"I would ask of this poor man," said Father Eustace, "for what purpose\r\nhe nourished the thought of putting to death one who never did him\r\nevil?"\r\n\r\n"Ay! but thou didst menace me with evil," said the ruffian, "and no\r\none but a fool is menaced twice. Dost thou not remember what you said\r\ntouching the Primate and Lord James, and the black pool of Jedwood?\r\nDidst thou think me fool enough to wait till thou hadst betrayed me to\r\nthe sack and the fork! There were small wisdom in that, methinks--as\r\nlittle as in coming hither to tell my own misdeeds--I think the devil\r\nwas in me when I took this road--I might have remembered the proverb,\r\n\'Never Friar forgot feud.\'"\r\n\r\n"And it was solely for that--for that only hasty word of mine, uttered\r\nin a moment of impatience, and forgotten ere it was well spoken?" said\r\nFather Eustace.\r\n\r\n"Ay! for that, and--for the love of thy gold crucifix," said Christie of\r\nthe Clinthill.\r\n\r\n"Gracious Heaven! and could the yellow metal--the glittering earth--so\r\nfar overcome every sense of what is thereby represented?--Father Abbot,\r\nI pray, as a dear boon, you will deliver this guilty person to my\r\nmercy."\r\n\r\n"Nay, brother," interposed the Sacristan, "to your doom, if you will,\r\nnot to your mercy--Remember, we are not all equally favoured by our\r\nblessed Lady, nor is it likely that every frock in the Convent will\r\nserve as a coat of proof when a lance is couched against it."\r\n\r\n"For that very reason," said the Sub-Prior, "I would not that for my\r\nworthless self the community were to fall at feud with Julian of Avenel,\r\nthis man\'s master."\r\n\r\n"Our Lady forbid!" said the Sacristan, "he is a second Julian the\r\nApostate."\r\n\r\n"With our reverend father the Abbot\'s permission, then," said Father\r\nEustace, "I desire this man be freed from his chains, and suffered to\r\ndepart uninjured;--and here, friend," he added, giving him the golden\r\ncrucifix, "is the image for which thou wert willing to stain thy hands\r\nwith murder. View it well, and may it inspire thee with other and better\r\nthoughts than those which referred to it as a piece of bullion! Part\r\nwith it, nevertheless, if thy necessities require, and get thee one\r\nof such coarse substance that Mammon shall have no share in any of the\r\nreflections to which it gives rise. It was the bequest of a dear friend\r\nto me; but dearer service can it never do than that of winning a soul to\r\nHeaven."\r\n\r\nThe Borderer, now freed from his chains, stood gazing alternately on\r\nthe Sub-Prior, and on the golden crucifix. "By Saint Giles," said he,\r\n"I understand ye not!--An ye give me gold for couching my lance at thee,\r\nwhat would you give me to level it at a heretic?"\r\n\r\n"The Church," said the Sub-Prior, "will try the effect of her spiritual\r\ncensures to bring these stray sheep into the fold, ere she employ the\r\nedge of the sword of Saint Peter."\r\n\r\n"Ay, but," said the ruffian, "they say the Primate recommends a little\r\nstrangling and burning in aid of both censure and of sword. But fare ye\r\nweel, I owe you a life, and it may be I will not forget my debt."\r\n\r\nThe bailie now came bustling in, dressed in his blue coat and\r\nbandaliers, and attended by two or three halberdiers. "I have been a\r\nthought too late in waiting upon your reverend lordship. I am grown\r\nsomewhat fatter since the field of Pinkie, and my leathern coat slips\r\nnot on so soon as it was wont; but the dungeon is ready, and though, as\r\nI said, I have been somewhat late--"\r\n\r\nHere his intended prisoner walked gravely up to the officer\'s nose, to\r\nhis great amazement.\r\n\r\n"You have been indeed somewhat late, bailie," said he, "and I am greatly\r\nobligated to your buff-coat, and to the time you took to put it on. If\r\nthe secular arm had arrived some quarter of an hour sooner, I had been\r\nout of the reach of spiritual grace; but as it is, I wish you good even,\r\nand a safe riddance out of your garment of durance, in which you have\r\nmuch the air of a hog in armour."\r\n\r\nWroth was the bailie at this comparison, and exclaimed in ire--"An it\r\nwere not for the presence of the venerable Lord Abbot, thou knave--"\r\n\r\n"Nay, an thou wouldst try conclusions," said Christie of the Clinthill,\r\n"I will meet thee at day-break by Saint Mary\'s Well."\r\n\r\n"Hardened wretch!" said Father Eustace, "art thou but this instant\r\ndelivered from death, and dost thou so soon morse thoughts of\r\nslaughter?"\r\n\r\n"I will meet with thee ere it be long, thou knave," said the bailie,\r\n"and teach thee thine Oremus."\r\n\r\n"I will meet thy cattle in a moonlight night before that day," said he\r\nof the Clinthill.\r\n\r\n"I will have thee by the neck one misty morning, thou strong thief,"\r\nanswered the secular officer of the Church.\r\n\r\n"Thou art thyself as strong a thief as ever rode," retorted Christie;\r\n"and if the worms were once feasting on that fat carcass of thine I\r\nmight well hope to have thine office, by favour of these reverend men."\r\n\r\n"A cast of their office, and a cast of mine," answered the bailie; "a\r\ncord and a confessor, that is all thou wilt have from us."\r\n\r\n"Sirs," said the Sub-Prior, observing that his brethren began to take\r\nmore interest than was exactly decorous in this wrangling betwixt\r\njustice and iniquity, "I pray you both to depart--Master Bailie,\r\nretire with your halberdiers, and trouble not the man whom we have\r\ndismissed.--And thou, Christie, or whatever be thy name, take thy\r\ndeparture, and remember thou owest thy life to the Lord Abbot\'s\r\nclemency."\r\n\r\n"Nay, as to that," answered Christie, "I judge that I owe it to your\r\nown; but impute it to whom ye list, I owe a life among ye, and there is\r\nan end." And whistling as he went, he left the apartment, seeming as if\r\nhe held the life which he had forfeited not worthy further thanks.\r\n\r\n"Obstinate even to brutality!" said Father Eustace; "and yet who knows\r\nbut some better ore may lie under so rude an exterior?"\r\n\r\n"Save a thief from the gallows," said the Sacristan--"you know the rest\r\nof the proverb; and admitting, as may Heaven grant, that our lives and\r\nlimbs are safe from this outrageous knave, who shall insure our meal and\r\nour malt, our herds and our flocks?"\r\n\r\n"Marry, that will I, my brethren," said an aged monk. "Ah, brethren, you\r\nlittle know what may be made of a repentant robber. In Abbot Ingilram\'s\r\ndays--ay, and I remember them as it were yesterday--the freebooters were\r\nthe best welcome men that came to Saint Mary\'s. Ay, they paid tithe of\r\nevery drove that they brought over from the South, and because they\r\nwere something lightly come by, I have known them make the tithe a\r\nseventh--that is, if their confessor knew his business--ay, when we saw\r\nfrom the tower a score of fat bullocks, or a drove of sheep, coming down\r\nthe valley, with two or three stout men-at-arms behind them with their\r\nglittering steel caps, and their black-jacks, and their long lances, the\r\ngood Lord Abbot Ingilram was wont to say--he was a merry man--there come\r\nthe tithes of the spoilers of the Egyptians! Ay, and I have seen the\r\nfamous John the Armstrang--a fair man he was and a goodly, the more\r\npity that hemp was ever heckled for him--I have seen him come into the\r\nAbbey-church with nine tassels of gold in his bonnet, and every tassel\r\nmade of nine English nobles, and he would go from chapel to chapel, and\r\nfrom image to image, and from altar to altar, on his knees--and leave\r\nhere a tassel, and there a noble, till there was as little gold on his\r\nbonnet as on my hood--you will find no such Border thieves now!"\r\n\r\n"No, truly, Brother Nicolas," answered the Abbot; "they are more apt to\r\ntake any gold the Church has left, than to bequeath or bestow any--and\r\nfor cattle, beshrew me if I think they care whether beeves have fed on\r\nthe meadows of Lanercost Abbey or of Saint Mary\'s!"\r\n\r\n"There is no good thing left in them," said Father Nicolas; "they are\r\nclean naught--Ah, the thieves that I have seen!--such proper men! and as\r\npitiful as proper, and as pious as pitiful!"\r\n\r\n"It skills not talking of it, Brother Nicolas," said the Abbot; "and I\r\nwill now dismiss you, my brethren, holding your meeting upon this our\r\ninquisition concerning the danger of our reverend Sub-Prior, instead of\r\nthe attendance on the lauds this evening--Yet let the bells be duly rung\r\nfor the edification of the laymen without, and also that the novices may\r\ngive due reverence.--And now, benedicite, brethren! The cellarer will\r\nbestow on each a grace-cup and a morsel as ye pass the buttery, for ye\r\nhave been turmoiled and anxious, and dangerous it is to fall asleep in\r\nsuch case with empty stomach."\r\n\r\n"_Gratias agimus quam maximas, Domine reverendissime_," replied the\r\nbrethren, departing in their due order.\r\n\r\nBut the Sub-Prior remained behind, and falling on his knees before the\r\nAbbot, as he was about to withdraw, craved him to hear under the seal\r\nof confession the adventures of the day. The reverend Lord Abbot yawned,\r\nand would have alleged fatigue; but to Father Eustace, of all men,\r\nhe was ashamed to show indifference in his religious duties. The\r\nconfession, therefore, proceeded, in which Father Eustace told all the\r\nextraordinary circumstances which had befallen him during the journey.\r\nAnd being questioned by the Abbot, whether he was not conscious of any\r\nsecret sin, through which he might have been subjected for a time to the\r\ndelusions of evil spirits, the Sub-Prior admitted, with frank avowal,\r\nthat he thought he might have deserved such penance for having judged\r\nwith unfraternal rigour of the report of Father Philip the Sacristan.\r\n\r\n"Heaven," said the penitent, "may have been willing to convince me, not\r\nonly that he can at pleasure open a communication betwixt us and beings\r\nof a different, and, as we word it, supernatural class, but also to\r\npunish our pride of superior wisdom, or superior courage, or superior\r\nlearning."\r\n\r\nIt is well said that virtue is its own reward; and I question if duty\r\nwas ever more completely recompensed, than by the audience which\r\nthe reverend Abbot so unwillingly yielded to the confession of the\r\nSub-Prior. To find the object of his fear shall we say, or of his envy,\r\nor of both, accusing himself of the very error with which he had so\r\ntacitly charged him, was a corroboration of the Abbot\'s judgment,\r\na soothing of his pride, and an allaying of his fears. The sense\r\nof triumph, however, rather increased than diminished his natural\r\ngood-humour; and so far was Abbot Boniface from being disposed to\r\ntyrannize over his Sub-Prior in consequence of this discovery, that\r\nin his exhortation he hovered somewhat ludicrously betwixt the natural\r\nexpression of his own gratified vanity, and his timid reluctance to hurt\r\nthe feelings of Father Eustace.\r\n\r\n"My brother," said he, _ex cathedra_, "it cannot have escaped your\r\njudicious observation, that we have often declined our own judgment\r\nin favour of your opinion, even about those matters which most nearly\r\nconcerned the community. Nevertheless, grieved would we be, could you\r\nthink that we did this, either because we deemed our own opinion less\r\npregnant, or our wit more shallow, than that of our brethren. For it\r\nwas done exclusively to give our younger brethren, such as your much\r\nesteemed self, my dearest brother, that courage which is necessary to a\r\nfree deliverance of your opinion,--we ofttimes setting apart our proper\r\njudgment, that our inferiors, and especially our dear brother the\r\nSub-Prior, may be comforted and encouraged in proposing valiantly his\r\nown thoughts. Which our deference and humility may, in some sort, have\r\nproduced in your mind, most reverend brother, that self-opinion of parts\r\nand knowledge, which hath led unfortunately to your over-estimating your\r\nown faculties, and thereby subjecting yourself, as is but too visible,\r\nto the japes and mockeries of evil spirits. For it is assured that\r\nHeaven always holdeth us in the least esteem when we deem of ourselves\r\nmost highly, and also, on the other hand, it may be that we have\r\nsomewhat departed from what became our high seat in this Abbey, in\r\nsuffering ourselves to be too much guided, and even, as it were,\r\ncontrolled, by the voice of our inferior. Wherefore," continued the\r\nLord Abbot, "in both of us such faults shall and must be amended--you\r\nhereafter presuming less upon your gifts and carnal wisdom, and I taking\r\nheed not so easily to relinquish mine own opinion for that of one\r\nlower in place and in office. Nevertheless, we would not that we should\r\nthereby lose the high advantage which we have derived, and may yet\r\nderive, from your wise counsels, which hath been so often recommended to\r\nus by our most reverend Primate. Wherefore, on affairs of high moment,\r\nwe will call you to our presence in private, and listen to your opinion,\r\nwhich, if it shall agree with our own, we will deliver to the Chapter\r\nas emanating directly from ourselves; thus sparing you, dearest brother,\r\nthat seeming victory which is so apt to engender spiritual pride, and\r\navoiding ourselves the temptation of falling into that modest facility\r\nof opinion, whereby our office is lessened and our person (were that of\r\nconsequence) rendered less important in the eyes of the community over\r\nwhich we preside."\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the high notions which, as a rigid Catholic, Father\r\nEustace entertained of the sacrament of confession, as his Church calls\r\nit, there was some danger that a sense of the ridiculous might have\r\nstolen on him, when he heard his Superior, with such simple cunning,\r\nlay out a little plan for availing himself of the Sub-Prior\'s wisdom and\r\nexperience, while he should take the whole credit to himself. Yet his\r\nconscience immediately told him he was right.\r\n\r\n"I should have thought more," he reflected, "of the spiritual Superior,\r\nand less of the individual. I should have spread my mantle over the\r\nfrailties of my spiritual father, and done what I might to support his\r\ncharacter, and, of course, to extend his utility among the brethren, as\r\nwell as with others. The Abbot cannot be humbled, but what the community\r\nmust be humbled in his person. Her boast is, that over all her children,\r\nespecially over those called to places of distinction, she can diffuse\r\nthose gifts which are necessary to render them illustrious."\r\n\r\nActuated by these sentiments, Father Eustace frankly assented to the\r\ncharge which his Superior, even in that moment of authority, had rather\r\nintimated than made, and signified his humble acquiescence in any mode\r\nof communicating his counsel which might be most agreeable to the Lord\r\nAbbot, and might best remove from himself all temptation to glory in\r\nhis own wisdom. He then prayed the reverend Father to assign him such\r\npenance as might best suit his offence, intimating, at the same time,\r\nthat he had already fasted the whole day.\r\n\r\n"And it is that I complain of," answered the Abbot, instead of giving\r\nhim credit for his abstinence; "it is these very penances, fasts, and\r\nvigils, of which we complain; as tending only to generate airs and fumes\r\nof vanity, which, ascending from the stomach into the head, do but puff\r\nus up with vain-glory and self-opinion. It is meet and beseeming\r\nthat novices should undergo fasts and vigils; for some part of every\r\ncommunity must fast, and young stomachs may best endure it. Besides, in\r\nthem it abates wicked thoughts, and the desire of worldly delights. But,\r\nreverend brother, for those to fast who are dead and mortified to the\r\nworld, as I and thou, is work of supererogation, and is but the matter\r\nof spiritual pride. Wherefore, I enjoin thee, most reverend brother, go\r\nto the buttery and drink two cups at least of good wine, eating withal a\r\ncomfortable morsel, such as may best suit thy taste and stomach. And\r\nin respect that thine opinion of thy own wisdom hath at times made thee\r\nless conformable to, and companionable with, the weaker and less learned\r\nbrethren, I enjoin thee, during the said repast, to choose for thy\r\ncompanion, our reverend brother Nicolas, and without interruption or\r\nimpatience, to listen for a stricken hour to his narration, concerning\r\nthose things which befel in the times of our venerable predecessor,\r\nAbbot Ingilram, on whose soul may Heaven have mercy! And for such holy\r\nexercises as may farther advantage your soul, and expiate the faults\r\nwhereof you have contritely and humbly avowed yourself guilty, we\r\nwill ponder upon that matter, and announce our will unto you the next\r\nmorning."\r\n\r\nIt was remarkable, that after this memorable evening, the feelings of\r\nthe worthy Abbot towards his adviser were much more kindly and friendly\r\nthan when he deemed the Sub-Prior the impeccable and infallible person,\r\nin whose garment of virtue and wisdom no flaw was to be discerned. It\r\nseemed as if this avowal of his own imperfections had recommended Father\r\nEustace to the friendship of the Superior, although at the same time\r\nthis increase of benevolence was attended with some circumstances,\r\nwhich, to a man of the Sub-Prior\'s natural elevation of mind and temper,\r\nwere more grievous than even undergoing the legends of the dull and\r\nverbose Father Nicolas. For instance, the Abbot seldom mentioned him to\r\nthe other monks, without designing him our beloved Brother Eustace, poor\r\nman!--and now and then he used to warn the younger brethren against the\r\nsnares of vainglory and spiritual pride, which Satan sets for the more\r\nrigidly righteous, with such looks and demonstrations as did all but\r\nexpressly designate the Sub-Prior as one who had fallen at one time\r\nunder such delusions. Upon these occasions, it required all the votive\r\nobedience of a monk, all the philosophical discipline of the schools,\r\nand all the patience of a Christian, to enable Father Eustace to\r\nendure the pompous and patronizing parade of his honest, but somewhat\r\nthick-headed Superior. He began himself to be desirous of leaving the\r\nMonastery, or at least he manifestly declined to interfere with its\r\naffairs, in that marked and authoritative manner, which he had at first\r\npractised.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nChapter the Eleventh.\r\n\r\n\r\n    You call this education, do you not?\r\n    Why \'tis the forced march of a herd of bullocks\r\n    Before a shouting drover. The glad van\r\n    Move on at ease, and pause a while to snatch\r\n    A passing morsel from the dewy greensward,\r\n    While all the blows, the oaths, the indignation,\r\n    Fall on the croupe of the ill-fated laggard\r\n    That cripples in the rear.\r\n                                          OLD PLAY.\r\n\r\nTwo or three years glided on, during which the storm of the approaching\r\nalteration in church government became each day louder and more\r\nperilous. Owing to the circumstances which we have intimated in the\r\nend of the last chapter, the Sub-Prior Eustace appeared to have altered\r\nconsiderably his habits of life. He afforded, on all extraordinary\r\noccasions, to the Abbot, whether privately, or in the assembled Chapter,\r\nthe support of his wisdom and experience; but in his ordinary habits he\r\nseemed now to live more for himself, and less for the community, than\r\nhad been his former practice.\r\n\r\nHe often absented himself for whole days from the convent; and as the\r\nadventure of Glendearg dwelt deeply on his memory, he was repeatedly\r\ninduced to visit that lonely tower, and to take an interest in the\r\norphans who had their shelter under its roof. Besides, he felt a deep\r\nanxiety to know whether the volume which he had lost, when so strangely\r\npreserved from the lance of the murderer, had again found its way\r\nback to the Tower of Glendearg. "It was strange," he thought, "that a\r\nspirit," for such he could not help judging the being whose voice he had\r\nheard, "should, on the one side, seek the advancement of heresy, and, on\r\nthe other, interpose to save the life of a zealous Catholic priest."\r\n\r\nBut from no inquiry which he made of the various inhabitants of the\r\nTower of Glendearg could he learn that the copy of the translated\r\nScriptures, for which he made such diligent inquiry, had again been seen\r\nby any of them.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, the good father\'s occasional visits were of no\r\nsmall consequence to Edward Glendinning and to Mary Avenel. The former\r\ndisplayed a power of apprehending and retaining whatever was taught him,\r\nwhich tilled Father Eustace with admiration. He was at once acute and\r\nindustrious, alert and accurate; one of those rare combinations of\r\ntalent and industry, which are seldom united.\r\n\r\nIt was the earnest desire of Father Eustace that the excellent qualities\r\nthus early displayed by Edward should be dedicated to the service of\r\nthe Church, to which he thought the youth\'s own consent might be easily\r\nobtained, as he was of a calm, contemplative, retired habit, and seemed\r\nto consider knowledge as the principal object, and its enlargement as\r\nthe greatest pleasure, in life. As to the mother, the Sub-Prior had\r\nlittle doubt that, trained as she was to view the monks of Saint\r\nMary\'s with such profound reverence, she would be but too happy in an\r\nopportunity of enrolling one of her sons in its honoured community. But\r\nthe good Father proved to be mistaken in both these particulars.\r\n\r\nWhen he spoke to Elspeth Glendinning of that which a mother best loves\r\nto hear--the proficiency and abilities of her son--she listened with a\r\ndelighted ear. But when Father Eustace hinted at the duty of dedicating\r\nto the service of the Church, talents which seemed fitted to defend and\r\nadorn it, the dame endeavoured always to shift the subject; and when\r\npressed farther, enlarged on her own incapacity, as a lone woman, to\r\nmanage the feu; on the advantage which her neighbours of the township\r\nwere often taking of her unprotected state, and on the wish she had that\r\nEdward might fill his father\'s place, remain in the tower, and close her\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nOn such occasions the Sub-Prior would answer, that even in a worldly\r\npoint of view the welfare of the family would be best consulted by one\r\nof the sons entering into the community of Saint Mary\'s, as it was not\r\nto be supposed that he would fail to afford his family the important\r\nprotection which he could then easily extend towards them. What could\r\nbe a more pleasing prospect than to see him high in honour? or what more\r\nsweet than to have the last duties rendered to her by a son, reverend\r\nfor his holiness of life and exemplary manners? Besides, he endeavoured\r\nto impress upon the dame, that her eldest son, Halbert, whose bold\r\ntemper and headstrong indulgence of a wandering humour, rendered him\r\nincapable of learning, was, for that reason, as well as that he was her\r\neldest born, fittest to bustle through the affairs of the world, and\r\nmanage the little fief.\r\n\r\nElspeth durst not directly dissent from what was proposed, for fear of\r\ngiving displeasure, and yet she always had something to say against it.\r\nHalbert, she said, was not like any of the neighbour boys--he was taller\r\nby the head, and stronger by the half, than any boy of his years within\r\nthe Halidome. But he was fit for no peaceful work that could be devised.\r\nIf he liked a book ill, he liked a plough or a pattle worse. He had\r\nscoured his father\'s old broadsword--suspended it by a belt round his\r\nwaist, and seldom stirred without it. He was a sweet boy and a gentle\r\nif spoken fair, but cross him and he was a born devil. "In a word," she\r\nsaid, bursting into tears, "deprive me of Edward, good father, and ye\r\nbereave my house of prop and pillar; for my heart tells me that Halbert\r\nwill take to his father\'s gates, and die his father\'s death."\r\n\r\nWhen the conversation came to this crisis, the good-humoured monk\r\nwas always content to drop the discussion for the time, trusting some\r\nopportunity would occur of removing her prejudices, for such he thought\r\nthem, against Edward\'s proposed destination.\r\n\r\nWhen, leaving the mother, the Sub-Prior addressed himself to the son,\r\nanimating his zeal for knowledge, and pointing out how amply it might\r\nbe gratified should he agree to take holy orders, he found the same\r\nrepugnance which Dame Elspeth had exhibited. Edward pleaded a want of\r\nsufficient vocation to so serious a profession--his reluctance to\r\nleave his mother, and other objections, which the Sub-Prior treated as\r\nevasive.\r\n\r\n"I plainly perceive," he said one day, in answer to them, "that the\r\ndevil has his factors as well as Heaven, and that they are equally, or,\r\nalas! the former are perhaps more active, in bespeaking for their master\r\nthe first of the market. I trust, young man, that neither idleness, nor\r\nlicentious pleasure, nor the love of worldly gain and worldly grandeur,\r\nthe chief baits with which the great Fisher of souls conceals his hook,\r\nare the causes of your declining the career to which I would incite you.\r\nBut above all I trust--above all I hope--that the vanity of superior\r\nknowledge--a sin with which those who have made proficiency in learning\r\nare most frequently beset--has not led you into the awful hazard of\r\nlistening to the dangerous doctrines which are now afloat concerning\r\nreligion. Better for you that you were as grossly ignorant as the beasts\r\nwhich perish, that that the pride of knowledge should induce you to lend\r\nan ear to the voice of heretics." Edward Glendinning listened to the\r\nrebuke with a downcast look, and failed not, when it was concluded,\r\nearnestly to vindicate himself from the charge of having pushed his\r\nstudies into any subjects which the Church inhibited; and so the monk\r\nwas left to form vain conjectures respecting the cause of his reluctance\r\nto embrace the monastic state.\r\n\r\nIt is an old proverb, used by Chaucer, and quoted by Elizabeth, that\r\n"the greatest clerks are not the wisest men;" and it is as true as if\r\nthe poet had not rhymed, or the queen reasoned on it. If Father Eustace\r\nhad not had his thoughts turned so much to the progress of heresy, and\r\nso little to what was passing in the tower, he might have read, in the\r\nspeaking eyes of Mary Avenel, now a girl of fourteen or fifteen, reasons\r\nwhich might disincline her youthful companion towards the monastic vows.\r\nI have said, that she also was a promising pupil of the good father,\r\nupon whom her innocent and infantine beauty had an effect of which he\r\nwas himself, perhaps, unconscious. Her rank and expectations entitled\r\nher to be taught the arts of reading and writing;--and each lesson which\r\nthe monk assigned her was conned over in company with Edward, and by\r\nhim explained and re-explained, and again illustrated, until she became\r\nperfectly mistress of it.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of their studies, Halbert had been their school\r\ncompanion. But the boldness and impatience of his disposition soon\r\nquarrelled with an occupation in which, without assiduity and unremitted\r\nattention, no progress was to be expected. The Sub-Prior\'s visits were\r\nat regular intervals, and often weeks would intervene between them, in\r\nwhich case Halbert was sure to forget all that had been prescribed\r\nfor him to learn, and much which he had partly acquired before. His\r\ndeficiencies on these occasions gave him pain, but it was not of that\r\nsort which produces amendment.\r\n\r\nFor a time, like all who are fond of idleness, he endeavoured to detach\r\nthe attention of his brother and Mary Avenel from their task, rather\r\nthan to learn his own, and such dialogues as the following would ensue:\r\n\r\n"Take your bonnet, Edward, and make haste--the Laird of Colmslie is at\r\nthe head of the glen with his hounds."\r\n\r\n"I care not, Halbert," answered the younger brother; "two brace of dogs\r\nmay kill a deer without my being there to see them, and I must help Mary\r\nAvenel with her lesson."\r\n\r\n"Ay! you will labour at the monk\'s lessons till you turn monk yourself,"\r\nanswered Halbert.--"Mary, will you go with me, and I will show you the\r\ncushat\'s nest I told you of?"\r\n\r\n"I cannot go with you, Halbert," answered Mary, "because I must study\r\nthis lesson--it will take me long to learn it--I am sorry I am so dull,\r\nfor if I could get my task as fast as Edward, I should like to go with\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Should you indeed?" said Halbert; "then I will wait for you--and, what\r\nis more, I will try to get my lesson also."\r\n\r\nWith a smile and a sigh he took up the primer, and began heavily to\r\ncon over the task which had been assigned him. As if banished from the\r\nsociety of the two others, he sat sad and solitary in one of the deep\r\nwindow-recesses, and after in vain struggling with the difficulties\r\nof his task, and his disinclination to learn it, he found himself\r\ninvoluntarily engaged in watching the movements of the other two\r\nstudents, instead of toiling any longer.\r\n\r\nThe picture which Halbert looked upon was delightful in itself, but\r\nsomehow or other it afforded very little pleasure to him. The\r\nbeautiful girl, with looks of simple, yet earnest anxiety, was bent\r\non disentangling those intricacies which obstructed her progress to\r\nknowledge, and looking ever and anon to Edward for assistance, while,\r\nseated close by her side, and watchful to remove every obstacle from her\r\nway, he seemed at once to be proud of the progress which his pupil made,\r\nand of the assistance which he was able to render her. There was a bond\r\nbetwixt them, a strong and interesting tie, the desire of obtaining\r\nknowledge, the pride of surmounting difficulties.\r\n\r\nFeeling most acutely, yet ignorant of the nature and source of his own\r\nemotions, Halbert could no longer endure to look upon this quiet scene,\r\nbut, starting up, dashed his book from him, and exclaimed aloud, "To the\r\nfiend I bequeath all books, and the dreamers that make them!--I would\r\na score of Southrons would come up the glen, and we should learn how\r\nlittle all this muttering and scribbling is worth."\r\n\r\nMary Avenol and his brother started, and looked at Halbert with\r\nsurprise, while he went on with great animation, his features swelling,\r\nand the tears starting into his eyes as he spoke.--"Yes, Mary--I wish\r\na score of Southrons came up the glen this very day; and you should see\r\none good hand, and one good sword, do more to protect you, than all\r\nthe books that were ever opened, and all the pens that ever grew on a\r\ngoose\'s wing."\r\n\r\nMary looked a little surprised and a little frightened at his vehemence,\r\nbut instantly replied affectionately, "You are vexed, Halbert, because\r\nyou do not get your lesson so fast as Edward can; and so am I, for I am\r\nas stupid as you--But come, and Edward shall sit betwixt us and teach\r\nus."\r\n\r\n"He shall not teach _me_," said Halbert, in the same angry mood; "I\r\nnever can teach _him_ to do any thing that is honourable and manly, and\r\nhe shall not teach _me_ any of his monkish tricks.--I hate the monks,\r\nwith their drawling nasal tone like so many frogs, and their long\r\nblack petticoats like so many women, and their reverences, and their\r\nlordships, and their lazy vassals that do nothing but peddle in the mire\r\nwith plough and harrow from Yule to Michaelmas. I will call none lord,\r\nbut him who wears a sword to make his title good; and I will call none\r\nman, but he that can bear himself manlike and masterful."\r\n\r\n"For Heaven\'s sake, peace, brother!" said Edward; "if such words were\r\ntaken up and reported out of the house, they would be our mother\'s\r\nruin."\r\n\r\n"Report them yourself, then, and they will be _your_ making, and\r\nnobody\'s marring save mine own. Say that Halbert Glendinning will never\r\nbe vassal to an old man with a cowl and shaven crown, while there are\r\ntwenty barons who wear casque and plume that lack bold followers. Let\r\nthem grant you these wretched acres, and much meal may they bear you to\r\nmake your _brachan_." He left the room hastily, but instantly returned,\r\nand continued to speak with the same tone of quick and irritated\r\nfeeling. "And you need not think so much, neither of you, and especially\r\nyou, Edward, need not think so much of your parchment book there, and\r\nyour cunning in reading it. By my faith, I will soon learn to read as\r\nwell as you; and--for I know a better teacher than your grim old\r\nmonk, and a better book than his printed breviary; and since you like\r\nscholarcraft so well, Mary Avenel, you shall see whether Edward or I\r\nhave most of it." He left the apartment, and came not again.\r\n\r\n"What can be the matter with him?" said Mary, following Halbert with her\r\neyes from the window, as with hasty and unequal steps he ran up the\r\nwild glen--"Where can your brother be going, Edward?--what book?--what\r\nteacher does he talk of?"\r\n\r\n"It avails not guessing," said Edward. "Halbert is angry, he knows not\r\nwhy, and speaks of he knows not what; let us go again to our lessons,\r\nand he will come home when he has tired himself with scrambling among\r\nthe crags as usual."\r\n\r\nBut Mary\'s anxiety on account of Halbert seemed more deeply rooted.\r\nShe declined prosecuting the task in which they had been so pleasingly\r\nengaged, under the excuse of a headache; nor could Edward prevail upon\r\nher to resume it again that morning.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Halbert, his head unbonneted, his features swelled with\r\njealous anger, and the tear still in his eye, sped up the wild and upper\r\nextremity of the little valley of Glendearg with the speed of a roebuck,\r\nchoosing, as if in desperate defiance of the difficulties of the way,\r\nthe wildest and most dangerous paths, and voluntarily exposing himself a\r\nhundred times to dangers which he might have escaped by turning a little\r\naside from them. It seemed as if he wished his course to be as straight\r\nas that of the arrow to its mark.\r\n\r\nHe arrived at length in a narrow and secluded _cleuch_, or deep ravine,\r\nwhich ran down into the valley, and contributed a scanty rivulet to the\r\nsupply of the brook with which Glendearg is watered. Up this he sped\r\nwith the same precipitate haste which had marked his departure from\r\nthe tower, nor did he pause and look around until he had reached the\r\nfountain from which the rivulet had its rise.\r\n\r\nHere Halbert stopt short, and cast a gloomy, and almost a frightened\r\nglance around him. A huge rock rose in front, from a cleft of which grew\r\na wild holly-tree, whose dark green branches rustled over the spring\r\nwhich arose beneath. The banks on either hand rose so high, and\r\napproached each other so closely, that it was only when the sun was at\r\nits meridian height, and during the summer solstice, that its rays could\r\nreach the bottom of the chasm in which he stood. But it was now summer,\r\nand the hour was noon, so that the unwonted reflection of the sun was\r\ndancing in the pellucid fountain.\r\n\r\n"It is the season and the hour," said Halbert to himself; "and now I--I\r\nmight soon become wiser than Edward with all his pains! Mary should see\r\nwhether he alone is fit to be consulted, and to sit by her side, and\r\nhang over her as she reads, and point out every word and every letter.\r\nAnd she loves me better than him--I am sure she does--for she comes of\r\nnoble blood, and scorns sloth and cowardice.--And do I myself not stand\r\nhere slothful and cowardly as any priest of them all?--Why should I fear\r\nto call upon this form--this shape?--Already have I endured the vision,\r\nand why not again? What can it do to me, who am a man of lith and limb,\r\nand have by my side my father\'s sword? Does my heart beat--do my hairs\r\nbristle, at the thought of calling up a painted shadow, and how should\r\nI face a band of Southrons in flesh and blood? By the soul of the first\r\nGlendinning, I will make proof of the charm!"\r\n\r\nHe cast the leathern brogue or buskin from his right foot, planted\r\nhimself in a firm posture, unsheathed his sword, and first looking\r\naround to collect his resolution, he bowed three times deliberately\r\ntowards the holly-tree, and as often to the little fountain, repeating\r\nat the same time, with a determined voice, the following rhyme:\r\n\r\n  "Thrice to the holly brake--\r\n  Thrice to the well:--\r\n  I bid thee awake,\r\n  White Maid of Avenel!\r\n\r\n  "Noon gleams on the Lake--\r\n  Noon glows on the Fell--\r\n  Wake thee, O wake,\r\n  White Maid of Avenel!"\r\n\r\nThese lines were hardly uttered, when there stood the figure of a female\r\nclothed in white, within three steps of Halbert Glendinning.\r\n\r\n  "I guess\'twas frightful there to see\r\n  A lady richly clad as she--\r\n  Beautiful exceedingly." [Footnote: Coleridge\'s Christabelle.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *      *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter the Twelfth.\r\n\r\n\r\n  There\'s something in that ancient superstition,\r\n  Which, erring as it is, our fancy loves.\r\n  The spring that, with its thousand crystal bubbles,\r\n  Bursts from the bosom of some desert rock\r\n  In secret solitude, may well be deem\'d\r\n  The haunt of something purer, more refined,\r\n  And mightier than ourselves.\r\n              OLD PLAY.\r\n\r\nYoung Halbert Glendinning had scarcely pronounced the mystical rhymes,\r\nthan, as we have mentioned in the conclusion of the last chapter, an\r\nappearance, as of a beautiful female, dressed in white, stood within two\r\nyards of him. His terror for the moment overcame his natural courage, as\r\nwell as the strong resolution which he had formed, that the figure which\r\nhe had now twice seen should not a third time daunt him. But it would\r\nseem there is something thrilling and abhorrent to flesh and blood, in\r\nthe consciousness that we stand in presence of a being in form like to\r\nourselves, but so different in faculties and nature, that we can neither\r\nunderstand its purposes, nor calculate its means of pursuing them.\r\n\r\nHalbert stood silent and gasped for breath, his hairs erecting\r\nthemselves on his head---his mouth open--his eyes fixed, and, as the\r\nsole remaining sign of his late determined purpose, his sword pointed\r\ntowards the apparition. At length with a voice of ineffable sweetness,\r\nthe White Lady, for by that name we shall distinguish this being, sung,\r\nor rather chanted, the following lines:--\r\n\r\n  "Youth of the dark eye, wherefore didst thou call me?\r\n  Wherefore art thou here, if terrors can appal thee?\r\n  He that seeks to deal with us must know no fear nor failing!\r\n  To coward and churl our speech is dark, our gifts are unavailing.\r\n  The breeze that brought me hither now, must sweep Egyptian ground,\r\n  The fleecy cloud on which I ride for Araby is bound;\r\n  The fleecy cloud is drifting by, the breeze sighs for my stay,\r\n  For I must sail a thousand miles before the close of day."\r\n\r\nThe astonishment of Halbert began once more to give way to his\r\nresolution, and he gained voice enough to say, though with a faltering\r\naccent, "In the name of God, what art thou?" The answer was in melody of\r\na different tone and measure:--\r\n\r\n  "What I am I must not show--\r\n  What I am thou couldst not know--\r\n  Something betwixt heaven and hell--\r\n  Something that neither stood nor fell--\r\n  Something that through thy wit or will\r\n  May work thee good--may work thee ill.\r\n  Neither substance quite nor shadow,\r\n  Haunting lonely moor and meadow,\r\n  Dancing; by the haunted spring,\r\n  Riding on the whirlwind\'s wing;\r\n  Aping in fantastic fashion\r\n  Every change of human passion,\r\n\r\n  While o\'er our frozen minds they pass,\r\n  Like shadows from the mirror\'d glass.\r\n  Wayward, fickle is our mood,\r\n  Hovering betwixt bad and good,\r\n  Happier than brief-dated man,\r\n  Living twenty times his span;\r\n  Far less happy, for we have\r\n  Help nor hope beyond the grave!\r\n  Man awakes to joy or sorrow;\r\n  Ours the sleep that knows no morrow.\r\n  This is all that I can show--\r\n  This is all that thou mayest know."\r\n\r\nThe White Lady paused, and appeared to await an answer; but, as Halbert\r\nhesitated how to frame his speech, the vision seemed gradually to fade,\r\nand became more and more incorporeal. Justly guessing this to be a\r\nsymptom of her disappearance, Halbert compelled himself to say,--"Lady,\r\nwhen I saw you in the glen, and when you brought back the black book of\r\nMary Avenel, thou didst say I should one day learn to read it."\r\n\r\nThe White Lady replied,\r\n\r\n  "Ay! and I taught thee the word and the spell,\r\n  To waken me here by the Fairies\' Well,\r\n  But thou hast loved the heron and hawk,\r\n  More than to seek my haunted walk;\r\n  And thou hast loved the lance and the sword,\r\n  More than good text and holy word;\r\n  And thou hast loved the deer to track,\r\n  More than the lines and the letters black;\r\n  And thou art a ranger of moss and of wood,\r\n  And scornest the nurture of gentle blood."\r\n\r\n"I will do so no longer, fair maiden," said Halbert; "I desire to learn;\r\nand thou didst promise me, that when I did so desire, thou wouldst be\r\nmy helper; I am no longer afraid of thy presence, and I am no longer\r\nregardless of instruction." As he uttered these words, the figure of\r\nthe White Maiden grew gradually as distinct as it had been at first;\r\nand what had well-nigh faded into an ill-defined and colourless shadow,\r\nagain assumed an appearance at least of corporeal consistency, although\r\nthe hues were less vivid, and the outline of the figure less distinct\r\nand defined--so at least it seemed to Halbert--than those of an ordinary\r\ninhabitant of earth. "Wilt thou grant my request," he said, "fair Lady,\r\nand give to my keeping the holy book which Mary of Avenel has so often\r\nwept for?"\r\n\r\nThe White Lady replied:\r\n\r\n  "Thy craven fear my truth accused,\r\n  Thine idlehood my trust abused;\r\n  He that draws to harbour late,\r\n  Must sleep without, or burst the gate.\r\n\r\n  There is a star for thee which burn\'d.\r\n  Its influence wanes, its course is turn\'d;\r\n  Valour and constancy alone\r\n  Can bring thee back the chance that\'s flown."\r\n\r\n"If I have been a loiterer, Lady," answered young Glendinning, "thou\r\nshalt now find me willing to press forward with double speed. Other\r\nthoughts have filled my mind, other thoughts have engaged my heart,\r\nwithin a brief period--and by Heaven, other occupations shall\r\nhenceforward fill up my time. I have lived in this day the space of\r\nyears--I came hither a boy--I will return a man--a man, such as may\r\nconverse not only with his own kind, but with whatever God permits to be\r\nvisible to him. I will learn the contents of that mysterious volume--I\r\nwill learn why the Lady of Avenel loved it--why the priests feared,\r\nand would have stolen it--why thou didst twice recover it from their\r\nhands.--What mystery is wrapt in it?--Speak, I conjure thee!" The lady\r\nassumed an air peculiarly sad and solemn, as drooping her head, and\r\nfolding her arms on her bosom, she replied:\r\n\r\n  "Within that awful volume lies\r\n  The mystery of mysteries!\r\n  Happiest they of human race,\r\n  To whom God has granted grace\r\n\r\n  To read, to fear, to hope, to pray,\r\n  To lift the latch, and force the way;\r\n  And better had they ne\'er been born,\r\n  Who read, to doubt, or read to scorn."\r\n\r\n"Give me the volume, Lady," said young Glendinning. "They call me\r\nidle--they call me dull--in this pursuit my industry shall not fail,\r\nnor, with God\'s blessing, shall my understanding. Give me the volume."\r\nThe apparition again replied:\r\n\r\n  "Many a fathom dark and deep\r\n  I have laid the book to sleep;\r\n  Ethereal fires around it glowing--\r\n  Ethereal music ever flowing--\r\n    The sacred pledge of Heav\'n\r\n      All things revere.\r\n      Each in his sphere,\r\n    Save man for whom \'twas giv\'n:\r\n  Lend thy hand, and thou shalt spy\r\n  Things ne\'er seen by mortal eye."\r\n\r\nHalbert Glendinning boldly reached his hand to the White Lady.\r\n\r\n"Fearest thou to go with me?" she said, as his hand trembled at the soft\r\nand cold touch of her own--\r\n\r\n  "Fearest thou to go with me?\r\n  Still it is free to thee\r\n    A peasant to dwell:\r\n  Thou mayst drive the dull steer,\r\n  And chase the king\'s deer,\r\n  But never more come near\r\n  This haunted well."\r\n\r\n"If what thou sayest be true," said the undaunted boy, "my destinies are\r\nhigher than thine own. There shall be neither well nor wood which I dare\r\nnot visit. No fear of aught, natural or supernatural, shall bar my path\r\nthrough my native valley."\r\n\r\nHe had scarce uttered the words, when they both descended through the\r\nearth with a rapidity which took away Halbert\'s breath and every other\r\nsensation, saving that of being hurried on with the utmost velocity. At\r\nlength they stopped with a shock so sudden, that the mortal journeyer\r\nthrough this unknown space must have been thrown down with violence, had\r\nhe not been upheld by his supernatural companion.\r\n\r\nIt was more than a minute, ere, looking around him, he beheld a grotto,\r\nor natural cavern, composed of the most splendid spars and crystals,\r\nwhich returned in a thousand prismatic hues the light of a brilliant\r\nflame that glowed on an altar of alabaster. This altar, with its fire,\r\nformed the central point of the grotto, which was of a round form,\r\nand very high in the roof, resembling in some respects the dome of a\r\ncathedral. Corresponding to the four points of the compass, there went\r\noff four long galleries, or arcades, constructed of the same brilliant\r\nmaterials with the dome itself, and the termination of which was lost in\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\nNo human imagination can conceive, or words suffice to describe, the\r\nglorious radiance which, shot fiercely forth by the flame, was returned\r\nfrom so many hundred thousand points of reflection, afforded by the\r\nsparry pillars and their numerous angular crystals. The fire itself did\r\nnot remain steady and unmoved, but rose and fell, sometimes ascending\r\nin a brilliant pyramid of condensed flame half way up the lofty expanse,\r\nand again fading into a softer and more rosy hue, and hovering, as it\r\nwere, on the surface of the altar to collect its strength for another\r\npowerful exertion. There was no visible fuel by which it was fed, nor\r\ndid it emit either smoke or vapour of any kind.\r\n\r\nWhat was of all the most remarkable, the black volume so often mentioned\r\nlay not only unconsumed, but untouched in the slightest degree, amid\r\nthis intensity of fire, which, while it seemed to be of force sufficient\r\nto melt adamant, had no effect whatever on the sacred book thus\r\nsubjected to its utmost influence.\r\n\r\nThe White Lady, having paused long enough to let young Glendinning take\r\na complete survey of what was around him, now said in her usual chant,\r\n\r\n  "Here lies the volume thou boldly hast sought;\r\n  Touch it, and take it,--\'twill dearly be bought!"\r\n\r\nFamiliarized in some degree with marvels, and desperately desirous of\r\nshowing the courage he had boasted, Halbert plunged his hand, without\r\nhesitation, into the flame, trusting to the rapidity of the motion, to\r\nsnatch out the volume before the fire could greatly affect him. But he\r\nwas much disappointed. The flame instantly caught upon his sleeve, and\r\nthough he withdrew his hand immediately, yet his arm was so dreadfully\r\nscorched, that he had well-nigh screamed with pain. He suppressed the\r\nnatural expression of anguish, however, and only intimated the agony\r\nwhich he felt by a contortion and a muttered groan. The White Lady\r\npassed her cold hand over his arm, and, ere she had finished the\r\nfollowing metrical chant, his pain had entirely gone, and no mark of the\r\nscorching was visible:\r\n\r\n          "Rash thy deed,\r\n          Mortal weed\r\n    To immortal flames applying;\r\n          Rasher trust\r\n          Has thing of dust,\r\n    On his own weak worth relying:\r\n  Strip thee of such fences vain,\r\n  Strip, and prove thy luck, again."\r\n\r\nObedient to what he understood to be the meaning of his conductress,\r\nHalbert bared his arm to the shoulder, throwing down the remains of\r\nhis sleeve, which no sooner touched the floor on which he stood than\r\nit collected itself together, shrivelled itself up, and was without\r\nany visible fire reduced to light tinder, which a sudden breath of wind\r\ndispersed into empty space. The White Lady, observing the surprise of\r\nthe youth, immediately repeated--\r\n\r\n  "Mortal warp and mortal woof.\r\n  Cannot brook this charmed roof;\r\n  All that mortal art hath wrought,\r\n  In our cell returns to nought.\r\n  The molten gold returns to clay,\r\n  The polish\'d diamond melts away.\r\n  All is alter\'d, all is flown,\r\n  Nought stands fast but truth alone.\r\n  Not for that thy quest give o\'er:\r\n  Courage! prove thy chance once more."\r\n\r\nImboldened by her words, Halbert Glendinning made a second effort, and,\r\nplunging his bare arm into the flame, took out the sacred volume without\r\nfeeling either heat or inconvenience of any kind. Astonished, and almost\r\nterrified at his own success, he beheld the flame collect itself, and\r\nshoot up into one long and final stream, which seemed as if it would\r\nascend to the very roof of the cavern, and then, sinking as suddenly,\r\nbecame totally extinguished. The deepest darkness ensued; but Halbert\r\nhad no time to consider his situation, for the White Lady had already\r\ncaught his hand, and they ascended to upper air with the same velocity\r\nwith which they had sunk into the earth.\r\n\r\nThey stood by the fountain in the Corri-nan-shian when they emerged from\r\nthe bowels of the earth; but on casting a bewildered glance around him,\r\nthe youth was surprised to observe, that the shadows had fallen far\r\nto the east, and that the day was well-nigh spent. He gazed on his\r\nconductress for explanation, but her figure began to fade before his\r\neyes--her cheeks grew paler, her features less distinct, her form became\r\nshadowy, and blended itself with the mist which was ascending the hollow\r\nravine. What had late the symmetry of form, and the delicate, yet clear\r\nhues of feminine beauty, now resembled the flitting and pale ghost of\r\nsome maiden who has died for love, as it is seen indistinctly and by\r\nmoonlight, by her perjured lover.\r\n\r\n"Stay, spirit!" said the youth, imboldened by his success in the\r\nsubterranean dome, "thy kindness must not leave me, as one encumbered\r\nwith a weapon he knows not how to wield. Thou must teach me the art\r\nto read, and to understand this volume; else what avails it me that I\r\npossess it?"\r\n\r\nBut the figure of the White Lady still waned before his eye, until it\r\nbecame an outline as pale and indistinct as that of the moon, when the\r\nwinter morning is far advanced, and ere she had ended the following\r\nchant, she was entirely invisible:--\r\n\r\n  "Alas! alas!\r\n  Not ours the grace\r\n  These holy characters to trace:\r\n      Idle forms of painted air,\r\n      Not to us is given to share\r\n  The boon bestow\'d on Adam\'s race!\r\n      With patience bide.\r\n      Heaven will provide\r\n  The fitting time, the fitting guide."\r\n\r\nThe form was already gone, and now the voice itself had melted away in\r\nmelancholy cadence, softening, as if the Being who spoke had been slowly\r\nwafted from the spot where she had commenced her melody.\r\n\r\nIt was at this moment that Halbert felt the extremity of the terror\r\nwhich he had hitherto so manfully suppressed. The very necessity of\r\nexertion had given him spirit to make it, and the presence of the\r\nmysterious Being, while it was a subject of fear in itself, had\r\nnevertheless given him the sense of protection being near to him. It\r\nwas when he could reflect with composure on what had passed, that a cold\r\ntremor shot across his limbs, his hair bristled, and he was afraid to\r\nlook around lest he should find at his elbow something more frightful\r\nthan the first vision. A breeze arising suddenly, realized the beautiful\r\nand wild idea of the most imaginative of our modern bards [Footnote:\r\nColeridge.]--\r\n\r\n  It fann\'d his cheek, it raised his hair,\r\n    Like a meadow pale in spring;\r\n  It mingled strangely with his fears,\r\n    Yet it fell like a welcoming.\r\n\r\nThe youth stood silent and astonished for a few minutes. It seemed to\r\nhim that the extraordinary Being he had seen, half his terror, half his\r\nprotectress, was still hovering on the gale which swept past him, and\r\nthat she might again make herself sensible to his organs of sight.\r\n"Speak!" he said, wildly tossing his arms, "speak yet again--be once\r\nmore present, lovely vision!--thrice have I now seen thee, yet the\r\nidea of thy invisible presence around or beside me, makes my heart beat\r\nfaster than if the earth yawned and gave up a demon."\r\n\r\nBut neither sound nor appearance indicated the presence of the White\r\nLady, and nothing preternatural beyond what he had already witnessed,\r\nwas again audible or visible. Halbert, in the meanwhile, by the very\r\nexertion of again inviting the presence of this mysterious Being, had\r\nrecovered his natural audacity. He looked around once more, and resumed\r\nhis solitary path down the valley into whose recesses he had penetrated.\r\n\r\nNothing could be more strongly contrasted than the storm of passion with\r\nwhich he had bounded over stock and crag, in order to plunge himself\r\ninto the Corri-nan-shian, and the sobered mood in which he now returned\r\nhomeward, industriously seeking out the most practicable path, not from\r\na wish to avoid danger, but that he might not by personal toil distract\r\nhis attention, deeply fixed on the extraordinary scene which he had\r\nwitnessed. In the former case, he had sought by hazard and bodily\r\nexertion to indulge at once the fiery excitation of passion, and to\r\nbanish the cause of the excitement from his recollection; while now he\r\nstudiously avoided all interruption to his contemplative walk, lest the\r\ndifficulty of the way should interfere with, or disturb, his own deep\r\nreflections. Thus slowly pacing forth his course, with the air of a\r\npilgrim rather than of a deer-hunter, Halbert about the close of the\r\nevening regained his paternal tower.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter the Thirteenth.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Miller was of manly make,\r\n    To meet him was na mows;\r\n  There durst na ten come him to take,\r\n    Sae noited he their pows.\r\n            CHRIST\'S KIRK ON THE GREEN.\r\n\r\nIt was after sunset, as we have already stated, when Halbert Glendinning\r\nreturned to the abode of his father. The hour of dinner was at noon, and\r\nthat of supper about an hour after sunset at this period of the year.\r\nThe former had passed without Halbert\'s appearing; but this was no\r\nuncommon circumstance, for the chase, or any other pastime which\r\noccurred, made Halbert a frequent neglecter of hours; and his mother,\r\nthough angry and disappointed when she saw him not at table, was so much\r\naccustomed to his occasional absence, and knew so little how to teach\r\nhim more regularity, that a testy observation was almost all the censure\r\nwith which such omissions were visited.\r\n\r\nOn the present occasion, however, the wrath of good Dame Elspeth soared\r\nhigher than usual. It was not merely on account of the special tup\'s\r\nhead and trotters, the haggis and the side of mutton, with which her\r\ntable was set forth, but also because of the arrival of no less a person\r\nthan Hob Miller, as he was universally termed, though the man\'s name was\r\nHapper.\r\n\r\nThe object of the Miller\'s visit to the Tower of Glendearg was like the\r\npurpose of those embassies which potentates send to each other\'s courts,\r\npartly ostensible, partly politic. In outward show, Hob came to visit\r\nhis friends of the Halidome, and share the festivity common among\r\ncountry folk, after the barn-yard has been filled, and to renew old\r\nintimacies by new conviviality. But in very truth he also came to have\r\nan eye upon the contents of each stack, and to obtain such information\r\nrespecting the extent of the crop reaped and gathered in by each feuar,\r\nas might prevent the possibility of _abstracted multures_.\r\n\r\nAll the world knows that the cultivators of each barony or regality,\r\ntemporal or spiritual, in Scotland, are obliged to bring their corn\r\nto be grinded at the mill of the territory, for which they pay a heavy\r\ncharge, called the _intown multures_. I could speak to the thirlage\r\nof _invecta et illata_ too, but let that pass. I have said enough\r\nto intimate that I talk not without book. Those of the _Sucken_, or\r\nenthralled ground, were liable in penalties, if, deviating from this\r\nthirlage, (or thraldom,) they carried their grain to another mill. Now\r\nsuch another mill, erected on the lands of a lay-baron, lay within a\r\ntempting and convenient distance of Glendearg; and the Miller was so\r\nobliging, and his charges so moderate, that it required Hob Miller\'s\r\nutmost vigilance to prevent evasions of his right of monopoly.\r\n\r\nThe most effectual means he could devise was this show of good\r\nfellowship and neighbourly friendship,--under colour of which he made\r\nhis annual cruise through the barony--numbered every corn-stack, and\r\ncomputed its contents by the boll, so that he could give a shrewd hint\r\nafterwards whether or not the grist came to the right mill.\r\n\r\nDame Elspeth, like her compeers, was obliged to take these domiciliary\r\nvisits in the sense of politeness; but in her case they had not occurred\r\nsince her husband\'s death, probably because the Tower of Glendearg was\r\ndistant, and there was but a trifling quantity of arable or _infield_\r\nland attached to it. This year there had been, upon some speculation of\r\nold Martin\'s, several bolls sown in the exit-field, which, the season\r\nbeing fine, had ripened remarkably well. Perhaps this circumstance\r\noccasioned the honest Miller\'s including Glendearg, on this occasion, in\r\nhis annual round Dame Glendinning received with pleasure a visit which\r\nshe used formerly only to endure with patience; and she had changed her\r\nview of the matter chiefly, if not entirely, because Hob had brought\r\nwith him his daughter Mysie, of whose features she could give so slight\r\nan account, but whose dress she had described so accurately to the\r\nSub-Prior.\r\n\r\nHitherto this girl had been an object of very trifling consideration in\r\nthe eyes of the good widow; but the Sub-Prior\'s particular and somewhat\r\nmysterious inquiries had set her brains to work on the subject of Mysie\r\nof the Mill; and she had here asked a broad question, and there she had\r\nthrown out an innuendo, and there again she had gradually led on to a\r\nconversation on the subject of poor Mysie. And from all inquiries\r\nand investigations she had collected, that Mysie was a dark-eyed,\r\nlaughter-loving wench, with cherry-cheeks, and a skin as white as her\r\nfather\'s finest bolted flour, out of which was made the Abbot\'s own\r\nwastel-bread. For her temper, she sung and laughed from morning to\r\nnight; and for her fortune, a material article, besides that which the\r\nMiller might have amassed by means of his proverbial golden thumb, Mysie\r\nwas to inherit a good handsome lump of land, with a prospect of the mill\r\nand mill-acres descending to her husband on an easy lease, if a fair\r\nword were spoken in season to the Abbot, and to the Prior, and to the\r\nSub-Prior, and to the Sacristan, and so forth.\r\n\r\nBy turning and again turning these advantages over in her own mind,\r\nElspeth at length came to be of opinion, that the only way to save her\r\nson Halbert from a life of "spur, spear, and snaffle," as they called\r\nthat of the border-riders, from the dint of a cloth-yard shaft, or the\r\nloop of an inch-cord, was, that he should marry and settle, and that\r\nMysie Happer should be his destined bride.\r\n\r\nAs if to her wish, Hob Miller arrived on his strong-built mare, bearing\r\non a pillion behind him the lovely Mysie, with cheeks like a peony-rose,\r\n(if Dame Glendinning had ever seen one,) spirits all afloat with rustic\r\ncoquetry, and a profusion of hair as black as ebony. The _beau-ideal_\r\nwhich Dame Glendinning had been bodying forth in her imagination, became\r\nunexpectedly realized in the buxom form of Mysie Happer, whom, in the\r\ncourse of half an hour, she settled upon as the maiden who was to fix\r\nthe restless and untutored Halbert. True, Mysie, as the dame soon saw,\r\nwas like to love dancing round a May-pole as well as managing a domestic\r\nestablishment, and Halbert was like to break more heads than he would\r\ngrind stacks of corn. But then a miller should always be of manly\r\nmake, and has been described so since the days of Chaucer and James I.\r\n[Footnote: The verse we have chosen for a motto, is from a poem imputed\r\nto James I. of Scotland. As for the Miller who figures among the\r\nCanterbury pilgrims, besides his sword and buckler, he boasted other\r\nattributes, all of which, but especially the last, show that he relied\r\nmore on the strength of the outside than that of the inside of his\r\nskull.\r\n\r\n  The miller was a stout carl for the nones,\r\n  Full big he was of brawn, and eke of bones;\r\n  That proved well, for wheresoe\'r he cam,\r\n  At wrestling he wold bear away the ram;\r\n  He was short shoulder\'d, broad, a thick gnar;\r\n  There n\'as no door that he n\'old heave of bar,\r\n  Or break it at a running with his head, &c. ]\r\n\r\nIndeed, to be able to outdo and bully the whole _Sucken_, (once more we\r\nuse this barbarous phrase,) in all athletic exercises, was one way to\r\nrender easy the collection of dues which men would have disputed with a\r\nless formidable champion. Then, as to the deficiencies of the miller\'s\r\nwife, the dame was of opinion that they might be supplied by the\r\nactivity of the miller\'s mother. "I will keep house for the young folk\r\nmyself, for the tower is grown very lonely," thought Dame Glendinning,\r\n"and to live near the kirk will be mair comfortable in my auld age--and\r\nthen Edward may agree with his brother about the feu, more especially as\r\nhe is a favourite with the Sub-Prior, and then he may live in the auld\r\ntower like his worthy father before him--and wha kens but Mary Avenel,\r\nhigh-blood as she is, may e\'en draw in her stool to the chimney-nook,\r\nand sit down here for good and a\'?--It\'s true she has no tocher, but the\r\nlike of her for beauty and sense ne\'er crossed my een; and I have kend\r\nevery wench in the Halidome of St. Mary\'s--ay, and their mothers that\r\nbore them--ay, she is a sweet and a lovely creature as ever tied snood\r\nover brown hair--ay, and then, though her uncle keeps her out of her ain\r\nfor the present time, yet it is to be thought the gray-goose shaft will\r\nfind a hole in his coat of proof, as, God help us! it has done in many a\r\nbetter man\'s--And, moreover, if they should stand on their pedigree and\r\ngentle race, Edward might say to them, that is, to her gentle kith and\r\nkin, \'whilk o\' ye was her best friend, when she came down the glen to\r\nGlendearg in a misty evening, on a beast mair like a cuddie than aught\r\nelse?\'--And if they tax him with churl\'s blood, Edward might say, that,\r\nforby the old proverb, how\r\n\r\n  Gentle deed\r\n  Makes gentle bleid;\r\n\r\nyet, moreover, there comes no churl\'s blood from Glendinning or Brydone;\r\nfor, says Edward--"\r\n\r\nThe hoarse voice of the Miller at this moment recalled the dame from her\r\nreverie, and compelled her to remember that if she meant to realize her\r\nairy castle, she must begin by laying the foundation in civility to\r\nher guest and his daughter, whom she was at that moment most strangely\r\nneglecting, though her whole plan turned on conciliating their favour\r\nand good opinion, and that, in fact, while arranging matters for\r\nso intimate a union with her company, she was suffering them to sit\r\nunnoticed, and in their riding gear, as if about to resume their\r\njourney. "And so I say, dame," concluded the Miller, (for she had not\r\nmarked the beginning of his speech,) "an ye be so busied with your\r\nhousekep, or ought else, why, Mysie and I will trot our way down the\r\nglen again to Johnnie Broxmouth\'s, who pressed us right kindly to bide\r\nwith him."\r\n\r\nStarting at once from her dream of marriages and intermarriages, mills,\r\nmill-lands, and baronies, Dame Elspeth felt for a moment like the\r\nmilk-maid in the fable, when she overset the pitcher, on the contents\r\nof which so many golden dreams were founded. But the foundation of Dame\r\nGlendinning\'s hopes was only tottering, not overthrown, and she hastened\r\nto restore its equilibrium. Instead of attempting to account for her\r\nabsence of mind and want of attention to her guests, which she might\r\nhave found something difficult, she assumed the offensive, like an able\r\ngeneral when he finds it necessary, by a bold attack, to disguise his\r\nweakness.\r\n\r\nA loud exclamation she made, and a passionate complaint she set up\r\nagainst the unkindness of her old friend, who could for an instant doubt\r\nthe heartiness of her welcome to him and to his hopeful daughter; and\r\nthen to think of his going back to Johnny Broxmouth\'s, when the auld\r\ntower stood where it did, and had room in it for a friend or two in the\r\nworst of times--and he too a neighbour that his umquhile gossip Simon,\r\nblessed be his cast, used to think the best friend he had in\r\nthe Halidome! And on she went, urging her complaint with so much\r\nseriousness, that she had well-nigh imposed on herself as well as upon\r\nHob Miller, who had no mind to take any thing in dudgeon; and as it\r\nsuited his plans to pass the night at Glendearg, would have been\r\nequally contented to do so even had his reception been less vehemently\r\nhospitable.\r\n\r\nTo all Elspeth\'s expostulations on the unkindness of his proposal to\r\nleave her dwelling, he answered composedly, "Nay, dame, what could I\r\ntell? ye might have had other grist to grind, for ye looked as if ye\r\nscarce saw us--or what know I? ye might bear in mind the words Martin\r\nand I had about the last barley ye sawed--for I ken dry multures\r\n[Footnote: Dry multures were a fine, or compensation in money, for not\r\ngrinding at the mill of the thirl. It was, and is, accounted a vexatious\r\nexaction.] will sometimes stick in the throat. A man seeks but his awn,\r\nand yet folk shall hold him for both miller and miller\'s man, that is\r\nmillar and knave, [Footnote: The under miller is, in the language of\r\nthirlage, called the knave, which, indeed, signified originally his lad.\r\n(_Knabe_--German,) but by degrees came to be taken in a worse sense. In\r\nthe old translation of the Bible, Paul is made to term himself the knave\r\nof our Saviour. The allowance of meal taken by the miller\'s servant was\r\ncalled knave-ship.] all the country over."\r\n\r\n"Alas, that you will say so, neighbour Hob," said Dame Elspeth, "or that\r\nMartin should have had any words with you about the mill-dues! I will\r\nchide him roundly for it, I promise you, on the faith of a true widow.\r\nYou know full well that a lone woman is sore put upon by her servants."\r\n\r\n"Nay, dame," said the miller, unbuckling the broad belt which made\r\nfast his cloak, and served, at the same time, to suspend by his side a\r\nswinging Andrea Ferrara, "bear no grudge at Martin, for I bear none--I\r\ntake it on me as a thing of mine office, to maintain my right of\r\nmulture, lock, and gowpen. [Note: The multure was the regular exaction\r\nfor grinding the meal. The _lock_, signifying a small quantity, and the\r\n_gowpen_, a handful, were additional perquisites demanded by the\r\nmiller, and submitted to or resisted by the _Suckener_ as circumstances\r\npermitted. These and other petty dues were called in general the\r\n_Sequels_.] And reason good, for as the old song says,\r\n\r\n  I live by my mill. God bless her,\r\n   She\'s parent, child, and wife.\r\n\r\nThe poor old slut, I am beholden to her for my living, and bound to\r\nstand by her, as I say to my mill knaves, in right and in wrong. And so\r\nshould every honest fellow stand by his bread-winner.--And so, Mysie,\r\nye may doff your cloak since our neighbour is so kindly glad to see\r\nus--why, I think, we are as blithe to see her--not one in the Halidome\r\npays their multures more duly, sequels, arriage, and carriage, and\r\nmill-services, used and wont."\r\n\r\nWith that the Miller hung his ample cloak without farther ceremony upon\r\na huge pair of stag\'s antlers, which adorned at once the naked walls of\r\nthe tower, and served for what we vulgarly call cloak-pins.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Dame Elspeth assisted to disembarrass the damsel whom\r\nshe destined for her future daughter-in-law, of her hood, mantle, and\r\nthe rest of her riding gear, giving her to appear as beseemed the buxom\r\ndaughter of the wealthy Miller, gay and goodly, in a white kirtle,\r\nthe seams of which were embroidered with green silken lace or fringe,\r\nentwined with some silver thread. An anxious glance did Elspoth cast\r\nupon the good-humoured face, which was now more fully shown to her, and\r\nwas only obscured by a quantity of raven black hair, which the maid\r\nof the mill had restrained by a snood of green silk, embroidered with\r\nsilver, corresponding to the trimmings of her kirtle. The countenance\r\nitself was exceedingly comely--the eyes black, large, and roguishly\r\ngood-humoured--the mouth was small--the lips well formed, though\r\nsomewhat full--the teeth were pearly white--and the chin had a very\r\nseducing dimple in it. The form belonging to this joyous face was full\r\nand round, and firm and fair. It might become coarse and masculine\r\nsome years hence, which is the common fault of Scottish beauty; but in\r\nMysie\'s sixteenth year she had the shape of a Hebe. The anxious Elspeth,\r\nwith all her maternal partiality, could not help admitting within\r\nherself, that a better man than Halbert might go farther and fare worse.\r\nShe looked a little giddy, and Halbert was not nineteen; still it was\r\ntime he should be settled, for to that point the dame always returned;\r\nand here was an excellent opportunity.\r\n\r\nThe simple cunning of Dame Elspeth now exhausted itself in commendations\r\nof her fair guest, from the snood, as they say, to the single-soled\r\nshoe. Mysie listened and blushed with pleasure for the first five\r\nminutes; but ere ten had elapsed, she began to view the old lady\'s\r\ncompliments rather as subjects of mirth than of vanity, and was much\r\nmore disposed to laugh at than to be flattered with them, for Nature had\r\nmingled the good-humour with which she had endowed the damsel with no\r\nsmall portion of shrewdness. Even Hob himself began to tire of hearing\r\nhis daughter\'s praises, and broke in with, "Ay, ay, she is a clever\r\nquean enough; and, were she five years older, she shall lay a loaded\r\nsack on an _aver_ [Note: _Aver_--properly a horse of labour.] with e\'er\r\na lass in the Halidome. But I have been looking for your two sons, dame.\r\nMen say downby that Halbert\'s turned a wild springald, and that we may\r\nhave word of him from Westmoreland one moonlight night or another."\r\n\r\n"God forbid, my good neighbour; God, in his mercy, forbid!" said Dame\r\nGlendinning, earnestly; for it was touching the very key-note of her\r\napprehensions, to hint any probability that Halbert might become one of\r\nthe marauders so common in the age and country. But, fearful of having\r\nbetrayed too much alarm on this subject, she immediately added, "That\r\nthough, since the last rout at Pinkiecleuch, she had been all of a\r\ntremble when a gun or a spear was named, or when men spoke of fighting;\r\nyet, thanks to God and our Lady, her sons were like to live and die\r\nhonest and peaceful tenants to the Abbey, as their father might have\r\ndone, but for that awful hosting which he went forth to with mony a\r\nbrave man that never returned."\r\n\r\n"Ye need not tell me of it, dame," said the Miller, "since I was there\r\nmyself, and made two pair of legs (and these were not mine, but my\r\nmare\'s,) worth one pair of hands. I judged how it would be, when I\r\nsaw our host break ranks, with rushing on through that broken ploughed\r\nfield, and so as they had made a pricker of me, I e\'en pricked off with\r\nmyself while the play was good."\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay, neighbour," said the dame, "ye were aye a wise and a wary man;\r\nif my Simon had had your wit, he might have been here to speak about\r\nit this day; but he was aye cracking of his good blood and his high\r\nkindred, and less would not serve him than to bide the bang to the last,\r\nwith the earls, and knights, and squires, that had no wives to greet for\r\nthem, or else had wives that cared not how soon they were widows; but\r\nthat is not for the like of us. But touching my son Halbert, there is no\r\nfear of him; for if it should be his misfortune to be in the like case,\r\nhe has the best pair of heels in Halidome, and could run almost as fast\r\nas your mare herself."\r\n\r\n"Is this he, neighbour?" quoth the Miller.\r\n\r\n"No," replied the mother; "that is my youngest son, Edward, who can read\r\nand write like the Lord Abbot himself, if it were not a sin to say so."\r\n\r\n"Ay," said the Miller; "and is that the young clerk the Sub-Prior thinks\r\nso much of? they say he will come far ben that lad; wha kens but he may\r\ncome to be Sub-Prior himself?--as broken a ship has come to land."\r\n\r\n"To be a Prior, neighbour Miller," said Edward, "a man must first be a\r\npriest, and for that I judge I have little vocation."\r\n\r\n"He will take to the pleugh-pettle, neighbour," said the good dame; "and\r\nso will Halbert too, I trust. I wish you saw Halbert.--Edward, where is\r\nyour brother?"\r\n\r\n"Hunting, I think," replied Edward; "at least he left us this morning to\r\njoin the Laird of Colmslie and his hounds. I have heard them baying in\r\nthe glen all day."\r\n\r\n"And if I had heard that music," said the Miller, "it would have done my\r\nheart good, ay, and may be taken me two or three miles out of my road.\r\nWhen I was the Miller of Morebattle\'s knave, I have followed the hounds\r\nfrom Eckford to the foot of Hounam-law--followed them on foot, Dame\r\nGlendinning, ay, and led the chase when the Laird of Cessford and his\r\ngay riders were all thrown out by the mosses and gills. I brought the\r\nstag on my back to Hounam Cross, when the dogs had pulled him down. I\r\nthink I see the old gray knight, as he sate so upright on his strong\r\nwar-horse, all white with foam; and \'Miller,\' said he to me, \'an thou\r\nwilt turn thy back on the mill, and wend with me, I will make a man of\r\nthee.\' But I chose rather to abide by clap and happer, and the better\r\nluck was mine; for the proud Percy caused hang five of the Laird\'s\r\nhenchmen at Alnwick for burning a rickle of houses some gate beyond\r\nFowberry, and it might have been my luck as well as another man\'s."\r\n\r\n"Ah, neighbour, neighbour," said Dame Glendinning, "you were aye wise\r\nand wary; but if you like hunting, I must say Halbert\'s the lad to\r\nplease you. He hath all those fair holiday terms of hawk and hound as\r\nready in his mouth as Tom with the tod\'s tail, that is the Lord Abbot\'s\r\nranger."\r\n\r\n"Ranges he not homeward at dinner-time, dame," demanded the Miller; "for\r\nwe call noon the dinner-hour at Kennaquhair?"\r\n\r\nThe widow was forced to admit that, even at this important period of the\r\nday, Halbert was frequently absent; at which the Miller shook his\r\nhead, intimating, at the same time, some allusion to the proverb of\r\nMacFarlane\'s geese, which "liked their play better than their meat."\r\n[Footnote: A brood of wild-geese, which long frequented one of the\r\nuppermost islands in Loch-Lomond, called Inch-Tavoe, were supposed to\r\nhave some mysterious connexion with the ancient family of MacFarlane of\r\nthat ilk, and it is said were never seen after the ruin and extinction\r\nof that house. The MacFarlanes had a house and garden upon that same\r\nisland of Inch-Tavoe. Here James VI. was, on one occasion, regaled by\r\nthe chieftain. His Majesty had been previously much amused by the geese\r\npursuing each other on the Loch. But, when one which was brought\r\nto table, was found to be tough and ill fed, James observed--"that\r\nMacFarlane\'s geese liked their play better than their meat," a proverb\r\nwhich has been current ever since.]\r\n\r\nThat the delay of dinner might not increase the Miller\'s disposition to\r\nprejudge Halbert, Dame Glendinning called hastily on Mary Avenel to take\r\nher task of entertaining Mysie Happer, while she herself rushed to\r\nthe kitchen, and, entering at once into the province of Tibb Tacket,\r\nrummaged among trenchers and dishes, snatched pots from the fire, and\r\nplaced pans and gridirons on it, accompanying her own feats of personal\r\nactivity with such a continued list of injunctions to Tibb, that Tibb at\r\nlength lost patience, and said, "Here was as muckle wark about meating\r\nan auld miller, as if they had been to banquet the blood of Bruce." But\r\nthis, as it was supposed to be spoken aside, Dame Glendinning did not\r\nthink it convenient to hear.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter the Fourteenth.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Nay, let me have the friends who eat my victuals,\r\n  As various as my dishes.--The feast\'s naught,\r\n  Where one huge plate predominates. John Plaintext,\r\n  He shall be mighty beef, our English staple;\r\n  The worthy Alderman, a butter\'d dumpling;\r\n  Yon pair of whisker\'d Cornets, ruffs and rees:\r\n  Their friend the Dandy, a green goose in sippets.\r\n  And so the hoard is spread at once and fill\'d\r\n  On the same principle--Variety.\r\n                           NEW PLAY.\r\n\r\n"And what brave lass is this?" said Hob Miller, as Mary Avenel entered\r\nthe apartment to supply the absence of Dame Elspeth Glendinning.\r\n\r\n"The young Lady of Avenel, father," said the Maid of the Mill, dropping\r\nas low a curtsy as her rustic manners enabled her to make. The Miller,\r\nher father, doffed his bonnet, and made his reverence, not altogether so\r\nlow perhaps as if the young lady had appeared in the pride of rank and\r\nriches, yet so as to give high birth the due homage which the Scotch for\r\na length of time scrupulously rendered to it.\r\n\r\nIndeed, from having had her mother\'s example before her for so many\r\nyears, and from a native sense of propriety and even of dignity,\r\nMary Avenel had acquired a demeanour, which marked her title to\r\nconsideration, and effectually checked any attempt at familiarity on the\r\npart of those who might be her associates in her present situation, but\r\ncould not be well termed her equals. She was by nature mild, pensive,\r\nand contemplative, gentle in disposition, and most placable when\r\naccidentally offended; but still she was of a retired and reserved\r\nhabit, and shunned to mix in ordinary sports, even--when the rare\r\noccurrence of a fair or wake gave her an opportunity of mingling\r\nwith companions of her own age. If at such scenes she was seen for an\r\ninstant, she appeared to behold them with the composed indifference of\r\none to whom their gaiety was a matter of no interest, and who seemed\r\nonly desirous to glide away from the scene as soon as she possibly\r\ncould.\r\n\r\nSomething also had transpired concerning her being born on All-hallow\r\nEve, and the powers with which that circumstance was supposed to invest\r\nher over the invisible world. And from all-these particulars combined,\r\nthe young men and women of the Halidome used to distinguish Mary among\r\nthemselves by the name of the Spirit of Avenel, as if the fair but\r\nfragile form, the beautiful but rather colourless cheek, the dark blue\r\neye, and the shady hair, had belonged rather to the immaterial than\r\nthe substantial world. The general tradition of the White Lady, who was\r\nsupposed to wait on the fortunes of the family of Avenel, gave a sort of\r\nzest to this piece of rural wit. It gave great offence, however, to\r\nthe two sons of Simon Glendinning; and when the expression was in\r\ntheir presence applied to the young lady, Edward was wont to check the\r\npetulance of those who used it by strength of argument, and Halbert by\r\nstrength of arm. In such cases Halbert had this advantage, that although\r\nho could render no aid to his brother\'s argument, yet when circumstances\r\nrequired it, he was sure to have that of Edward, who never indeed\r\nhimself commenced a fray, but, on the other hand, did not testify any\r\nreluctance to enter into combat in Halbert\'s behalf or in his rescue.\r\n\r\nBut the zealous attachment of the two youths, being themselves, from\r\nthe retired situation in which they dwelt, comparative strangers in\r\nthe Halidome, did not serve in any degree to alter the feelings of the\r\ninhabitants towards the young lady, who seemed to have dropped amongst\r\nthem from another sphere of life. Still, however, she was regarded with\r\nrespect, if not with fondness; and the attention of the Sub-Prior to the\r\nfamily, not to mention the formidable name of Julian Avenel, which every\r\nnew incident of those tumultuous times tended to render more famous,\r\nattached to his niece a certain importance. Thus some aspired to her\r\nacquaintance out of pride while the more timid of the feuars were\r\nanxious to inculcate upon their children the necessity of being\r\nrespectful to the noble orphan. So that Mary Avenel, little loved\r\nbecause little known, was regarded with a mysterious awe, partly derived\r\nfrom fear of her uncle\'s moss-troopers, and partly from her own retired\r\nand distant habits, enhanced by the superstitious opinions of the time\r\nand country.\r\n\r\nIt was not without some portion of this awe, that Mysie felt herself\r\nleft alone in company with a young person so distant in rank, and so\r\ndifferent in bearing, from herself; for her worthy father had taken\r\nthe first opportunity to step out unobserved, in order to mark how the\r\nbarnyard was filled, and what prospect it afforded of grist to the mill.\r\nIn youth, however, there is a sort of free-masonry, which, without much\r\nconversation, teaches young persons to estimate each other\'s character,\r\nand places them at ease on the shortest acquaintance. It is only when\r\ntaught deceit by the commerce of the world, that we learn to shroud our\r\ncharacter from observation, and to disguise our real sentiments from\r\nthose with whom we are placed in communion.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the two young women were soon engaged in such objects of\r\ninterest as best became their age. They visited Mary Avenel\'s pigeons,\r\nwhich she nursed with the tenderness of a mother; they turned over her\r\nslender stores of finery, which yet contained some articles that excited\r\nthe respect of her companion, though Mysie was too good-humoured\r\nto nourish envy. A golden rosary, and some female ornaments marking\r\nsuperior rank, had been rescued in the moment of their utmost adversity,\r\nmore by Tibb Tacket\'s presence of mind, than by the care of their\r\nowner,--who was at that sad period too much sunk in grief to pay\r\nany attention to such circumstances. They struck Mysie with a deep\r\nimpression of veneration; for, excepting what the Lord Abbot and the\r\nconvent might possess, she did not believe there was so much real gold\r\nin the world as was exhibited in these few trinkets, and Mary, however\r\nsage and serious, was not above being pleased with the admiration of her\r\nrustic companion.\r\n\r\nNothing, indeed, could exhibit a stronger contrast than the appearance\r\nof the two girls;--the good-humoured laughter-loving countenance of\r\nthe Maid of the Mill, who stood gazing with unrepressed astonishment\r\non whatever was in her inexperienced eye rare and costly, and with an\r\nhumble, and at the same time cheerful acquiescence in her inferiority,\r\nasking all the little queries about the use and value of the ornaments,\r\nwhile Mary Avenel, with her quiet composed dignity and placidity\r\nof manner, produced them one after another for the amusement of her\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\nAs they became gradually more familiar, Mysie of the Mill was just\r\nventuring to ask, why Mary Avenel never appeared at the May-pole, and to\r\nexpress her wonder when the young lady said she disliked dancing, when\r\na trampling of horses at the gate of the tower interrupted their\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\nMysie flew to the shot-window in the full ardour of unrestrained female\r\ncuriosity. "Saint Mary! sweet lady! here come two well-mounted gallants;\r\nwill you step this way to look at them ?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Mary Avenel, "you shall tell me who they are."\r\n\r\n"Well, if you like it better," said Mysie--"but how shall I know\r\nthem?---Stay, I do know one of them, and so do you, lady; he is a blithe\r\nman, somewhat light of hand, they say, but the gallants of these days\r\nthink no great harm of that. He is your uncle\'s henchman, that they call\r\nChristie of the Clinthill; and he has not his old green jerkin and the\r\nrusty blackjack over it, but a scarlet cloak, laid down with silver lace\r\nthree inches broad, and a breast-plate you might see to dress your hair\r\nin, as well as in that keeking-glass in the ivory frame that you showed\r\nme even now. Come, dear lady, come to the shot-window and see him."\r\n\r\n"If it be the man you mean, Mysie," replied the orphan of Avenel, "I\r\nshall see him soon enough, considering either the pleasure or comfort\r\nthe sight will give me."\r\n\r\n"Nay, but if you will not come to see gay Christie," replied the Maid of\r\nthe Mill, her face flushed with eager curiosity, "come and tell me who\r\nthe gallant is that is with him, the handsomest, the very lovesomest\r\nyoung man I ever saw with sight."\r\n\r\n"It is my foster-brother, Halbert Glendinning," said Mary, with,\r\napparent indifference; for she had been accustomed to call the sons of\r\nElspeth her foster-brethren, and to live with them as if they had been\r\nbrothers in earnest.\r\n\r\n"Nay, by Our Lady, that it is not," said Mysie; "I know the favour\r\nof both the Glendinnings well, and I think this rider be not of our\r\ncountry. He has a crimson velvet bonnet, and long brown hair falling\r\ndown under it, and a beard on his upper lip, and his chin clean and\r\nclose shaved, save a small patch on the point of the chin, and a\r\nsky-blue jerkin slashed and lined with white satin, and trunk-hose to\r\nsuit, and no weapon but a rapier and dagger--Well, if I was a man, I\r\nwould never wear weapon but the rapier! it is so slender and becoming,\r\ninstead of having a cartload of iron at my back, like my father\'s\r\nbroad-sword with its great rusty basket-hilt. Do you not delight in the\r\nrapier and poniard, lady?"\r\n\r\n"The best sword," answered Mary, "if I must needs answer a question of\r\nthe sort, is that which is drawn in the best cause, and which is best\r\nused when it is out of the scabbard."\r\n\r\n"But can you not guess who this stranger should be?" said Mysie.\r\n\r\n"Indeed, I cannot even attempt it; but to judge by his companion, it is\r\nno matter how little he is known," replied Mary.\r\n\r\n"My benison on his bonny face," said Mysie, "if he is not going to\r\nalight here! Now, I am as much pleased as if my father had given me the\r\nsilver earrings he has promised me so often;--nay, you had as well come\r\nto the window, for you must see him by and by whether you will or not."\r\nI do not know how much sooner Mary Avenel might have sought the point\r\nof observation, if she had not been scared from it by the unrestrained\r\ncuriosity expressed by her buxom friend; but at length the same feeling\r\nprevailed over her sense of dignity, and satisfied with having displayed\r\nall the indifference that was necessary in point of decorum, she no\r\nlonger thought herself bound to restrain her curiosity.\r\n\r\nFrom the outshot or projecting window, she could perceive that Christie\r\nof the Clinthill was attended on the present occasion by a very gay and\r\ngallant cavalier, who, from the nobleness of his countenance and manner,\r\nhis rich and handsome dress, and the showy appearance of his horse and\r\nfurniture, must, she agreed with her new friend, be a person of some\r\nconsequence.\r\n\r\nChristie also seemed conscious of something, which made him call out\r\nwith more than his usual insolence of manner, "What, ho! so ho!\r\nthe house! Churl peasants, will no one answer when I call?--Ho!\r\nMartin,--Tibb,--Dame Glendinning--a murrain on you, must we stand\r\nkeeping our horses in the cold here, and they steaming with heat, when\r\nwe have ridden so sharply?"\r\n\r\nAt length he was obeyed, and old Martin made his appearance. "Ha!" said\r\nChristie, "art thou there, old Truepenny? here, stable me these steeds,\r\nand see them well bedded, and stretch thine old limbs by rubbing them\r\ndown; and see thou quit not the stable till there is not a turned hair\r\non either of them."\r\n\r\nMartin took the horses to the stable as commanded, but suppressed not\r\nhis indignation a moment after he could vent it with safety. "Would not\r\nany one think," he said to Jasper, an old ploughman, who, in coming to\r\nhis assistance, had heard Christie\'s imperious injunctions, "that this\r\nloon, this Christie of the Clinthill, was laird or lord at least of him?\r\nNo such thing, man! I remember him a little dirty turnspit boy in the\r\nhouse of Avenel, that every body in a frosty morning like this warmed\r\nhis fingers by kicking or cuffing! and now he is a gentleman, and\r\nswears, d--n him and renounce him, as if the gentlemen could not so\r\nmuch as keep their own wickedness to themselves, without the like of\r\nhim going to hell in their very company, and by the same road. I have as\r\nmuch a mind as ever I had to my dinner, to go back and tell him to sort\r\nhis horse himself, since he is as able as I am."\r\n\r\n"Hout tout, man!" answered Jasper, "keep a calm sough; better to fleech\r\na fool than fight with him."\r\n\r\nMartin acknowledged the truth of the proverb, and, much comforted\r\ntherewith, betook himself to cleaning the stranger\'s horse with great\r\nassiduity, remarking, it was a pleasure to handle a handsome nag,\r\nand turned over the other to the charge of Jasper. Nor was it until\r\nChristie\'s commands were literally complied with that he deemed it\r\nproper, after fitting ablutions, to join the party in the spence; not\r\nfor the purpose of waiting upon them, as a mere modern reader might\r\npossibly expect, but that he might have his share of dinner in their\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, Christie had presented his companion to Dame\r\nGlendinning as Sir Piercie Shafton, a friend of his and of his master,\r\ncome to spend three or four days with little din in the tower. The good\r\ndame could not conceive how she was entitled to such an honour, and\r\nwould fain have pleaded her want of every sort of convenience to\r\nentertain a guest of that quality. But, indeed, the visiter, when\r\nhe cast his eyes round the bare walls, eyed the huge black chimney,\r\nscrutinized the meagre and broken furniture of the apartment, and\r\nbeheld the embarrassment of the mistress of the family, intimated great\r\nreluctance to intrude upon Dame Glendinning a visit, which could scarce,\r\nfrom all appearances, prove otherwise than an inconvenience to her, and\r\na penance to himself.\r\n\r\nBut the reluctant hostess and her guest had to do with an inexorable\r\nman, who silenced all expostulations with, "such was his master\'s\r\npleasure. And, moreover," he continued, "though the Baron of Avenel\'s\r\nwill must, and ought to prove law to all within ten miles around him,\r\nyet here, dame," he said, "is a letter from your petticoated baron, the\r\nlord-priest yonder, who enjoins you, as you regard his pleasure, that\r\nyou afford to this good knight such decent accommodation as is in your\r\npower, suffering him to live as privately as he shall desire.--And\r\nfor you, Sir Piercie Shafton," continued Christie, "you will judge for\r\nyourself, whether secrecy and safety is not more your object even now,\r\nthan soft beds and high cheer. And do not judge of the dame\'s goods\r\nby the semblance of her cottage; for you will see by the dinner she is\r\nabout to spread for us, that the vassal of the kirk is seldom found with\r\nher basket bare." To Mary Avenel, Christie presented the stranger, after\r\nthe best fashion he could, as to the niece of his master the baron.\r\n\r\nWhile he thus laboured to reconcile Sir Piercie Shafton to his fate, the\r\nwidow, having consulted her son Edward on the real import of the Lord\r\nAbbot\'s injunction, and having found that Christie had given a true\r\nexposition, saw nothing else left for her but to make that fate as easy\r\nas she could to the stranger. He himself also seemed reconciled to his\r\nlot by some feeling probably of strong necessity, and accepted with\r\na good grace the hospitality which the dame offered with a very\r\nindifferent one.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the dinner, which soon smoked before the assembled guests,\r\nwas of that substantial kind which warrants plenty and comfort. Dame\r\nGlendinning had cooked it after her best manner; and, delighted with the\r\nhandsome appearance which her good cheer made when placed on the table,\r\nforgot both her plans and the vexations which interrupted them, in the\r\nhospitable duty of pressing her assembled visiters to eat and drink,\r\nwatching every trencher as it waxed empty, and loading it with fresh\r\nsupplies ere the guest could utter a negative.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, the company attentively regarded each other\'s motions,\r\nand seemed endeavouring to form a judgment of each other\'s character.\r\nSir Piercie Shafton condescended to speak to no one but to Mary Avenel,\r\nand on her he conferred exactly the same familiar and compassionate,\r\nthough somewhat scornful sort of attention, which a pretty fellow of\r\nthese days will sometimes condescend to bestow on a country miss, when\r\nthere is no prettier or more fashionable woman present. The manner\r\nindeed was different, for the etiquette of those times did not permit\r\nSir Piercie Shafton to pick his teeth, or to yawn, or to gabble like the\r\nbeggar whose tongue (as he says) was cut out by the Turks, or to affect\r\ndeafness or blindness, or any other infirmity of the organs. But though\r\nthe embroidery of his conversation was different, the groundwork was the\r\nsame, and the high-flown and ornate compliments with which the gallant\r\nknight of the sixteenth century inter-larded his conversation, were as\r\nmuch the offspring of egotism and self-conceit, as the jargon of the\r\ncoxcombs of our own days.\r\n\r\nThe English knight was, however, something daunted at finding that Mary\r\nAvenel listened with an air of indifference, and answered with wonderful\r\nbrevity, to all the fine things which ought, as he conceived, to have\r\ndazzled her with their brilliancy, and puzzled her by their obscurity.\r\nBut if he was disappointed in making the desired, or rather the expected\r\nimpression, upon her whom he addressed, Sir Piercie Shafton\'s discourse\r\nwas marvellous in the ears of Mysie the Miller\'s daughter, and not the\r\nless so that she did not comprehend the meaning of a single word which\r\nhe uttered. Indeed, the gallant knight\'s language was far too courtly to\r\nbe understood by persons of much greater acuteness than Mysie\'s.\r\n\r\nIt was about this period, that the "only rare poet of his time, the\r\nwitty, comical, facetiously-quick, and quickly-facetious, John Lylly--he\r\nthat sate at Apollo\'s table, and to whom Phoebus gave a wreath of his\r\nown bays without snatching" [Footnote: Such, and yet more extravagant,\r\nare the compliments paid to this author by his editor, Blount.\r\nNotwithstanding all exaggeration, Lylly was really a man of wit and\r\nimagination, though both were deformed by the most unnatural affectation\r\nthat ever disgraced a printed page.]--he, in short, who wrote that\r\nsingularly coxcomical work, called _Euphues and his England_, was in the\r\nvery zenith of his absurdity and his reputation. The quaint, forced,\r\nand unnatural style which he introduced by his "Anatomy of Wit," had\r\na fashion as rapid as it was momentary--all the court ladies were his\r\nscholars, and to _parler Euphuisme_, was as necessary a qualification to\r\na courtly gallant, as those of understanding how to use his rapier, or\r\nto dance a measure.\r\n\r\nIt was no wonder that the Maid of the Mill was soon as effectually\r\nblinded by the intricacies of this erudite and courtly style of\r\nconversation, as she had ever been by the dust of her father\'s own\r\nmeal-sacks. But there she sate with her mouth and eyes as open as the\r\nmill-door and the two windows, showing teeth as white as her father\'s\r\nbolted flour, and endeavouring to secure a word or two for her own\r\nfuture use out of the pearls of rhetoric which Sir Piercie Shafton\r\nscattered around him with such bounteous profusion.\r\n\r\nFor the male part of the company, Edward felt ashamed of his own manner\r\nand slowness of speech, when he observed the handsome young courtier,\r\nwith an ease and volubility of which he had no conception, run over\r\nall the commonplace topics of high-flown gallantry. It is true the good\r\nsense and natural taste of young Glendinning soon informed him that the\r\ngallant cavalier was speaking nonsense. But, alas! where is the man of\r\nmodest merit, and real talent, who has not suffered from being outshone\r\nin conversation and outstripped in the race of life, by men of less\r\nreserve, and of qualities more showy, though less substantial? and well\r\nconstituted must the mind be, that can yield up the prize without envy\r\nto competitors more worthy than himself.\r\n\r\nEdward Glendinning had no such philosophy. While he despised the jargon\r\nof the gay cavalier, he envied the facility with which he could run on,\r\nas well as the courtly tone and expression, and the perfect ease and\r\nelegance with which he offered all the little acts of politeness to\r\nwhich the duties of the table gave opportunity. And if I am to speak\r\ntruth, I must own that he envied those qualities the more as they\r\nwere all exercised in Mary Avenel\'s service, and, although only so\r\nfar accepted as they could not be refused, intimated a wish on the\r\nstranger\'s part to place himself in her good graces, as the only person\r\nin the room to whom he thought it worth while to recommend himself. His\r\ntitle, rank, and very handsome figure, together with some sparks of wit\r\nand spirit which flashed across the cloud of nonsense which he uttered,\r\nrendered him, as the words of the old song say, "a lad for a lady\'s\r\nviewing;" so that poor Edward, with all his real worth and acquired\r\nknowledge, in his home-spun doublet, blue cap, and deerskin trowsers,\r\nlooked like a clown beside the courtier, and, feeling the full\r\ninferiority, nourished no good-will to him by whom he was eclipsed.\r\n\r\nChristie, on the other hand, as soon as he had satisfied to the full a\r\ncommodious appetite, by means of which persons of his profession could,\r\nlike the wolf and eagle, gorge themselves with as much food at one meal\r\nas might serve them for several days, began also to feel himself more in\r\nthe back-ground than he liked to be. This worthy had, amongst his other\r\ngood qualities, an excellent opinion of himself; and, being of a bold\r\nand forward disposition, had no mind to be thrown into the shade by\r\nany one. With an impudent familiarity which such persons mistake for\r\ngraceful ease, he broke in upon the knight\'s finest speeches with as\r\nlittle remorse as he would have driven the point of his lance through a\r\nlaced doublet. Sir Piercie Shafton, a man of rank and high birth, by no\r\nmeans encouraged or endured this familiarity, and requited the intruder\r\neither with total neglect, or such laconic replies as intimated a\r\nsovereign contempt for the rude spearman, who affected to converse with\r\nhim upon terms of equality.\r\n\r\nThe Miller held his peace; for, as his usual conversation turned chiefly\r\non his clapper and toll-dish, he had no mind to brag of his wealth in\r\npresence of Christie of the Clinthill, or to intrude his discourse on\r\nthe English cavalier.\r\n\r\nA little specimen of the conversation may not be out of place, were it\r\nbut to show young ladies what fine things they have lost by living when\r\nEuphuism is out of fashion.\r\n\r\n"Credit me, fairest lady," said the knight, "that such is the cunning\r\nof our English courtiers, of the hodiernal strain, that, as they\r\nhave infinitely refined upon the plain and rusticial discourse of\r\nour fathers, which, as I may say, more beseemed the mouths of country\r\nroisterers in a May-game than that of courtly gallants in a galliard,\r\nso I hold it ineffably and unutterably impossible, that those who may\r\nsucceed us in that garden of wit and courtesy shall alter or amend it.\r\nVenus delighted but in the language of Mercury, Bucephalus will stoop to\r\nno one but Alexander, none can sound Apollo\'s pipe but Orpheus."\r\n\r\n"Valiant sir," said Mary, who could scarcely help laughing, "we have\r\nbut to rejoice in the chance which hath honoured this solitude with a\r\nglimpse of the sun of courtesy, though it rather blinds than enlightens\r\nus."\r\n\r\n"Pretty and quaint, fairest lady," answered the Euphuist. "Ah, that I\r\nhad with me my Anatomy of Wit--that all-to-be-unparalleled volume--that\r\nquintessence of human wit--that treasury of quaint\r\ninvention--that exquisitively-pleasant-to-read, and\r\ninevitably-necessary-to-be-remembered manual, of all that is worthy\r\nto be known--which indoctrines the rude in civility, the dull in\r\nintellectuality, the heavy in jocosity, the blunt in gentility, the\r\nvulgar in nobility, and all of them in that unutterable perfection, of\r\nhuman utterance, that eloquence which no other eloquence is sufficient\r\nto praise, that art which, when we call it by its own name of Euphuism,\r\nwe bestow on it its richest panegyric."\r\n\r\n"By Saint Mary," said Christie of the Clinthill, "if your worship\r\nhad told me that you had left such stores of wealth as you talk of at\r\nPrudhoe Castle, Long Dickie and I would have had them off with us if man\r\nand horse could have carried them; but you told us of no treasure I wot\r\nof, save the silver tongs for turning up your mustachoes."\r\n\r\nThe knight treated this intruder\'s mistake--for certainly Christie had\r\nno idea that all these epithets which sounded so rich and splendid,\r\nwere lavished upon a small quarto volume--with a stare, and then turning\r\nagain to Mary Avenel, the only person whom he thought worthy to address,\r\nhe proceeded in his strain of high-flown oratory, "Even thus," said he,\r\n"do hogs contemn the splendour of Oriental pearls; even thus are the\r\ndelicacies of a choice repast in vain offered to the long-eared grazer\r\nof the common, who turneth from them to devour a thistle. Surely as\r\nidle is it to pour forth the treasures of oratory before the eyes of the\r\nignorant, and to spread the dainties of the intellectual banquet before\r\nthose who are, morally and metaphysically speaking, no better than\r\nasses."\r\n\r\n"Sir Knight, since that is your quality," said Edward, "we cannot strive\r\nwith you in loftiness of language; but I pray you in fair courtesy,\r\nwhile you honour my father\'s house with your presence, to spare us such\r\nvile comparisons."\r\n\r\n"Peace, good villagio," said the knight, gracefully waving his hand, "I\r\nprithee peace, kind rustic; and you, my guide, whom I may scarce call\r\nhonest, let me prevail upon you to imitate the laudable taciturnity of\r\nthat honest yeoman, who sits as mute as a mill-post, and of that\r\ncomely damsel, who seems as with her ears she drank in what she did not\r\naltogether comprehend, even as a palfrey listening to a lute, whereof,\r\nhowsoever, he knoweth not the gamut."\r\n\r\n"Marvellous fine words," at length said Dame Glendinning, who began to\r\nbe tired of sitting so long silent, "marvellous fine words, neighbour\r\nHapper, are they not?"\r\n\r\n"Brave words--very brave words--very exceeding pyet words," answered the\r\nMiller; "nevertheless, to speak my mind, a lippy of bran were worth a\r\nbushel of them."\r\n\r\n"I think so too, under his worship\'s favour," answered Christie of the\r\nClinthill. "I well remember that at the race of Morham, as we call\r\nit, near Berwick, I took a young Southern fellow out of saddle with my\r\nlance, and cast him, it might be, a gad\'s length from his nag; and so,\r\nas he had some gold on his laced doublet, I deemed he might ha\' the like\r\non it in his pocket too, though that is a rule that does not aye hold\r\ngood--So I was speaking to him of ransom, and out he comes with a\r\nhandful of such terms as his honour there hath gleaned up, and craved me\r\nfor mercy, as I was a true son of Mars, and such like."\r\n\r\n"And obtained no mercy at thy hand, I dare be sworn," said the knight,\r\nwho deigned not to speak Euphuism excepting to the fair sex.\r\n\r\n"By my troggs," replied Christie, "I would have thrust my lance down his\r\nthroat, but just then they flung open that accursed postern-gate, and\r\nforth pricked old Hunsdon, and Henry Carey, and as many fellows at their\r\nheels as turned the chase northward again. So I e\'en pricked Bayard with\r\nthe spur, and went off with the rest; for a man should ride when he may\r\nnot wrestle, as they say in Tynedale."\r\n\r\n"Trust me," said the knight, again turning to Mary Avenel, "if I do\r\nnot pity you, lady, who, being of noble blood, are thus in a manner\r\ncompelled to abide in the cottage of the ignorant, like the precious\r\nstone in the head of the toad, or like a precious garland on the brow of\r\nan ass.--But soft, what gallant have we here, whose garb savoureth more\r\nof the rustic than doth his demeanour, and whose looks seem more lofty\r\nthan his habit; even as--"\r\n\r\n"I pray you, Sir Knight," said Mary, "to spare your courtly similitudes\r\nfor refined ears, and give me leave to name unto you my foster-brother,\r\nHalbert Glendinning."\r\n\r\n"The son of the good dame of the cottage, as I opine," answered the\r\nEnglish knight; "for by some such name did my guide discriminate\r\nthe mistress of this mansion, which you, madam, enrich with your\r\npresence.--And yet, touching this juvenal, he hath that about him which\r\nbelongeth to higher birth, for all are not black who dig coals--"\r\n\r\n"Nor all white who are millers," said honest Happer, glad to get in a\r\nword, as they say, edgeways.\r\n\r\nHalbert, who had sustained the glance of the Englishman with some\r\nimpatience, and knew not what to make of his manner and language,\r\nreplied with some asperity, "Sir Knight, we have in this land of\r\nScotland an ancient saying, \'Scorn not the bush that bields you\'--you\r\nare a guest of my father\'s house to shelter you from danger, if I am\r\nrightly informed by the domestics. Scoff not its homeliness, nor that of\r\nits inmates--ye might long have abidden at the court of England, ere\r\nwe had sought your favour, or cumbered you with our society. Since your\r\nfate has sent you hither amongst us, be contented with such fare and\r\nsuch converse as we can afford you, and scorn us not for our kindness;\r\nfor the Scots wear short patience and long daggers."\r\n\r\nAll eyes were turned on Halbert while he was thus speaking, and\r\nthere was a general feeling that his countenance had an expression of\r\nintelligence, and his person an air of dignity, which they had never\r\nbefore observed. Whether it were that the wonderful Being with whom\r\nhe had so lately held communication, had bestowed on him a grace and\r\ndignity of look and bearing which he had not before, or whether the\r\nbeing conversant in high matters, and called to a destiny beyond that\r\nof other men, had a natural effect in giving becoming confidence to his\r\nlanguage and manner, we pretend not to determine. But it was evident\r\nto all, that, from this day, young Halbert was an altered man; that\r\nhe acted with the steadiness, promptitude, and determination,\r\nwhich belonged to riper years, and bore himself with a manner which\r\nappertained to higher rank.\r\n\r\nThe knight took the rebuke with good humour. "By my mine honour," he\r\nsaid, "thou hast reason on thy side, good juvenal--nevertheless, I spoke\r\nnot as in ridicule of the roof which relieves me, but rather in your own\r\npraise, to whom, if this roof be native, thou mayst nevertheless rise\r\nfrom its lowliness; even as the lark, which maketh its humble nest\r\nin the furrow, ascendeth towards the sun, as well as the eagle which\r\nbuildeth her eyry in the cliff."\r\n\r\nThis high-flown discourse was interrupted by Dame Glendinning, who, with\r\nall the busy anxiety of a mother, was loading her son\'s trencher with\r\nfood, and dinning in his ear her reproaches on account of his prolonged\r\nabsence. "And see," she said, "that you do not one day get such a sight\r\nwhile you are walking about among the haunts of them that are not of our\r\nflesh and bone, as befell Mungo Murray when he slept on the greensward\r\nring of the Auld Kirkhill at sunset, and wakened at daybreak in the wild\r\nhills of Breadalbane. And see that, when you are looking for deer, the\r\nred stag does not gall you as he did Diccon Thorburn, who never\r\novercast the wound that he took from a buck\'s horn. And see, when you go\r\nswaggering about with a long broadsword by your side, whilk it\r\nbecomes no peaceful man to do, that you dinna meet with them that have\r\nbroadsword and lance both--there are enow of rank riders in this land,\r\nthat neither fear God nor regard man."\r\n\r\nHere her eye "in a fine frenzy rolling," fell full upon that of Christie\r\nof the Clinthill, and at once her fears for having given offence\r\ninterrupted the current of maternal rebuke, which, like rebuke\r\nmatrimonial, may be often better meant than timed. There was something\r\nof sly and watchful significance in Christie\'s eye, an eye gray, keen,\r\nfierce, yet wily, formed to express at once cunning, and malice, which\r\nmade the dame instantly conjecture she had said too much, while she\r\nsaw in imagination her twelve goodly cows go lowing down the glen in a\r\nmoonlight night, with half a score of Border spearsmen at their heels.\r\n\r\nHer voice, therefore, sunk from the elevated tone of maternal authority\r\ninto a whimpering apologetic sort of strain, and she proceeded to say,\r\n"It is no that I have ony ill thoughts of the Border riders, for Tibb\r\nTacket there has often heard me say that I thought spear and bridle as\r\nnatural to a Borderman as a pen to a priest, or a feather-fan to a lady;\r\nand--have you not heard me say it, Tibb?"\r\n\r\nTibb showed something less than her expected alacrity in attesting her\r\nmistress\'s deep respect for the freebooters of the southland hills; but,\r\nthus conjured, did at length reply, "Hout ay, mistress, I\'se warrant I\r\nhave heard you say something like that."\r\n\r\n"Mother!" said Halbert, in a firm and commanding tone of voice, "what\r\nor whom is it that you fear under my father\'s roof?--I well hope that\r\nit harbours not a guest in whose presence you are afraid to say your\r\npleasure to me or my brother? I am sorry I have been detained so late,\r\nbeing ignorant of the fair company which I should encounter on my\r\nreturn.--I pray you let this excuse suffice: and what satisfies you,\r\nwill, I trust, be nothing less than acceptable to your guests."\r\n\r\nAn answer calculated so jistly betwixt the submission due to his parent,\r\nand the natural feeling of dignity in one who was by birth master of\r\nthe mansion, excited universal satisfaction. And as Elspeth herself\r\nconfessed to Tibb on the same evening, "She did not think it had been in\r\nthe callant. Till that night, he took pets and passions if he was spoke\r\nto, and lap through the house like a four-year-auld at the least word of\r\nadvice that was minted at him, but now he spoke as grave and as douce as\r\nthe Lord Abbot himself. She kendna," she said, "what might be the upshot\r\nof it, but it was like he was a wonderfu\' callant even now."\r\n\r\nThe party then separated, the young men retiring to their apartments,\r\nthe elder to their household cares. While Christie went to see his horse\r\nproperly accommodated, Edward betook himself to his book, and Halbert,\r\nwho was as ingenious in employing his hands as he had hitherto appeared\r\nimperfect in mental exertion, applied himself to constructing a place\r\nof concealment in the floor of his apartment by raising a plank, beneath\r\nwhich he resolved to deposit that copy of the Holy Scriptures which had\r\nbeen so strangely regained from the possession of men and spirits.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile Sir Piercie Shafton sate still as a stone, in the chair\r\nin which he had deposited himself, his hands folded on his breast, his\r\nlegs stretched straight out before him and resting upon the heels, his\r\neyes cast up to the ceiling as if he had meant to count every mesh of\r\nevery cobweb with which the arched roof was canopied, wearing at the\r\nsame time a face of as solemn and imperturbable gravity, as if his\r\nexistence had depended on the accuracy of his calculation.\r\n\r\nHe could scarce be roused from his listless state of contemplative\r\nabsorption so as to take some supper, a meal at which the younger\r\nfemales appeared not. Sir Piercie stared around twice or thrice as if he\r\nmissed something; but he asked not for them, and only evinced his sense\r\nof a proper audience being wanting, by his abstraction and absence of\r\nmind, seldom speaking until he was twice addressed, and then replying,\r\nwithout trope or figure, in that plain English which nobody could speak\r\nbetter when he had a mind.\r\n\r\nChristie, finding himself in undisturbed possession of the conversation,\r\nindulged all who chose to listen with details of his own wild and\r\ninglorious warfare, while Dame Elspeth\'s curch bristled with horror,\r\nand Tibb Tacket, rejoiced to find herself once more in the company of\r\na jackman, listened to his tales, like Desdemona to Othello\'s, with\r\nundisguised delight. Meantime the two young Glendinnings were each\r\nwrapped up in his own reflections, and only interrupted in them by the\r\nsignal to move bedward.\r\n\r\n        *        *         *        *         *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter the Fifteenth.\r\n\r\n\r\n  He strikes no coin,\'tis true, but coins new phrases,\r\n  And vends them forth as knaves vend gilded counters,\r\n  Which wise men scorn, and fools accept in payment.\r\n                             OLD PLAY.\r\n\r\nIn the morning Christie of the Clinthill was nowhere to be seen. As this\r\nworthy personage did seldom pique himself on sounding a trumpet before\r\nhis movements, no one was surprised at his moonlight departure, though\r\nsome alarm was excited lest he had not made it empty-handed. So, in the\r\nlanguage of the national ballad,\r\n\r\n  Some ran to cupboard, and some to kist,\r\n  But nought was away that could be mist.\r\n\r\nAll was in order, the key of the stable left above the door, and that of\r\nthe iron-grate in the inside of the lock. In short, the retreat had been\r\nmade with scrupulous attention to the security of the garrison, and so\r\nfar Christie left them nothing to complain of.\r\n\r\nThe safety of the premises was ascertained by Halbert, who instead of\r\ncatching up a gun or cross-bow, and sallying out for the day as had been\r\nhis frequent custom, now, with a gravity beyond his years, took a survey\r\nof all around the tower, and then returned to the spence, or public\r\napartment, in which, at the early hour of seven, the morning meal was\r\nprepared.\r\n\r\nThere he found the Euphuist in the same elegant posture of abstruse\r\ncalculation which he had exhibited on the preceding evening, his arms\r\nfolded in the same angle, his eyes turned up to the same cobwebs, and\r\nhis heels resting on the ground as before. Tired of this affectation of\r\nindolent importance, and not much flattered with his guest\'s persevering\r\nin it to the last, Halbert resolved at once to break the ice, being\r\ndetermined to know what circumstance had brought to the tower of\r\nGlendinning a guest at once so supercilious and so silent.\r\n\r\n"Sir Knight," he said with some firmness, "I have twice given you good\r\nmorning, to which the absence of your mind hath, I presume, prevented\r\nyou from yielding attention, or from making return. This exchange of\r\ncourtesy is at your pleasure to give or withhold--But, as what I have\r\nfurther to say concerns your comfort and your motions in an especial\r\nmanner, I will entreat you to give me some signs of attention, that I\r\nmay be sure I am not wasting my words on a monumental image."\r\n\r\nAt this unexpected address, Sir Piercie Shafton opened his eyes, and\r\nafforded the speaker a broad stare; but as Halbert returned the glance\r\nwithout either confusion or dismay, the knight thought proper to\r\nchange his posture, draw in his legs, raise his eyes, fix them on young\r\nGlendinning, and assume the appearance of one who listens to what is\r\nsaid to him. Nay, to make his purpose more evident, he gave voice to his\r\nresolution in these words, "Speak! we do hear."\r\n\r\n"Sir Knight," said the youth, "it is the custom of this Halidome, or\r\npatrimony of St. Mary\'s, to trouble with inquiries no guests who receive\r\nour hospitality, providing they tarry in our house only for a single\r\nrevolution of the sun. We know that both criminals and debtors come\r\nhither for sanctuary, and we scorn to extort from the pilgrim, whom\r\nchance may make our guest, an avowal of the cause of his pilgrimage and\r\npenance. But when one so high above our rank as yourself, Sir Knight,\r\nand especially one to whom the possession of such pre-eminence is not\r\nindifferent, shows his determination to be our guest for a longer time,\r\nit is our usage to inquire of him whence he comes, and what is the cause\r\nof his journey?"\r\n\r\nThe English knight gaped twice or thrice before he answered, and then\r\nreplied in a bantering tone, "Truly, good villagio, your question hath\r\nin it somewhat of embarrassment, for you ask me of things concerning\r\nwhich I am not as yet altogether determined what answer I may find it\r\nconvenient to make. Let it suffice thee, kind juvenal, that thou hast\r\nthe Lord Abbot\'s authority for treating me to the best of that power\r\nof thine, which, indeed, may not always so well suffice for my\r\naccommodation as either of us would desire."\r\n\r\n"I must have a more precise answer than this, Sir Knight," said the\r\nyoung Glendinning.\r\n\r\n"Friend," said the knight, "be not outrageous. It may suit your northern\r\nmanners thus to press harshly upon the secrets of thy betters; but\r\nbelieve me, that even as the lute, struck by an unskilful hand, doth\r\nproduce discords, so----" At this moment the door of the apartment\r\nopened, and Mary Avenel presented herself--"But who can talk of\r\ndiscords," said the knight, assuming his complimentary vein and humour,\r\n"when the soul of harmony descends upon us in the presence of surpassing\r\nbeauty! For even as foxes, wolves, and other animals void of sense and\r\nreason, do fly from the presence of the resplendent sun of heaven when\r\nhe arises in his glory, so do strife, wrath, and all ireful passions\r\nretreat, and, as it were, scud away, from the face which now beams upon\r\nus, with power to compose our angry passions, illuminate our errors and\r\ndifficulties, soothe our wounded minds, and lull to rest our disorderly\r\napprehensions; for as the heat and warmth of the eye of day is to the\r\nmaterial and physical world, so is the eye which I now bow down before\r\nto that of the intellectual microcosm."\r\n\r\nHe concluded with a profound bow; and Mary Avenel, gazing from one to\r\nthe other, and plainly seeing that something was amiss, could only say,\r\n"For heaven\'s sake, what is the meaning of this?"\r\n\r\nThe newly-acquired tact and intelligence of her foster-brother was as\r\nyet insufficient to enable him to give an answer. He was quite uncertain\r\nhow he ought to deal with a guest, who preserving a singularly high tone\r\nof assumed superiority and importance, seemed nevertheless so little\r\nserious in what he said, that it was quite impossible to discern with\r\naccuracy whether he was in jest or earnest.\r\n\r\nForming, however, the internal resolution to bring Sir Piercie Shafton\r\nto a reckoning at a more fit place and season, he resolved to prosecute\r\nthe matter no farther at present; and the entrance of his mother with\r\nthe damsel of the Mill, and the return of the honest Miller from the\r\nstack-yard, where he had been numbering and calculating the probable\r\namount of the season\'s grist, rendered farther discussion impossible for\r\nthe moment.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the calculation it could not but strike the man of meal\r\nand grindstones, that after the church\'s dues were paid, and after all\r\nwhich he himself could by any means deduct from the crop, still the\r\nresidue which must revert to Dame Glendinning could not be less than\r\nconsiderable. I wot not if this led the honest Miller to nourish any\r\nplans similar to those adopted by Elspeth; but it is certain that he\r\naccepted with grateful alacrity an invitation which the dame gave to his\r\ndaughter, to remain a week or two as her guest at Glendearg.\r\n\r\nThe principal persons being thus in high good humour with each other,\r\nall business gave place to the hilarity of the morning repast; and so\r\nmuch did Sir Piercie appear gratified by the attention which was paid to\r\nevery word that he uttered by the nut-brown Mysie, that, notwithstanding\r\nhis high birth and distinguished quality, he bestowed on her some of the\r\nmore ordinary and second-rate tropes of his elocution.\r\n\r\nMary Avenel, when relieved from the awkwardness of feeling the full\r\nweight of his conversation addressed to herself, enjoyed it much\r\nmore; and the good knight, encouraged by those conciliating marks of\r\napprobation from the sex, for whose sake he cultivated his oratorical\r\ntalents, made speedy intimation of his purpose to be more communicative\r\nthan he had shown himself in his conversation with Halbert Glendinning,\r\nand gave them to understand, that it was in consequence of some pressing\r\ndanger that he was at present their involuntary guest.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion of the breakfast was a signal for the separation of the\r\ncompany. The Miller went to prepare for his departure; his daughter\r\nto arrange matters for her unexpected stay; Edward was summoned to\r\nconsultation by Martin concerning some agricultural matter, in which\r\nHalbert could not be brought to interest himself; the dame left the room\r\nupon her household concerns, and Mary was in the act of following her,\r\nwhen she suddenly recollected, that if she did so, the strange knight\r\nand Halbert must be left alone together, at the risk of another quarrel.\r\n\r\nThe maiden no sooner observed this circumstance, than she instantly\r\nreturned from the door of the apartment, and, seating herself in a small\r\nstone window-seat, resolved to maintain that curb which she was sensible\r\nher presence imposed on Halbert Glendinning, of whose quick temper she\r\nhad some apprehensions.\r\n\r\nThe stranger marked her motions, and, either interpreting them as\r\ninviting his society, or obedient to those laws of gallantry which\r\npermitted him not to leave a lady in silence and solitude, he instantly\r\nplaced himself near to her side and opened the conversation as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n"Credit me, fair lady" he said, addressing Mary Avenel, "it much\r\nrejoiceth me, being, as I am, a banished man from the delights of mine\r\nown country, that I shall find here in this obscure and silvan cottage\r\nof the north, a fair form and a candid soul, with whom I may explain my\r\nmutual sentiments. And let me pray you in particular, lovely lady, that,\r\naccording to the universal custom now predominant in our court, the\r\ngarden of superior wits, you will exchange with me some epithet whereby\r\nyou may mark my devotion to your service. Be henceforward named, for\r\nexample, my Protection, and let me be your Affability."\r\n\r\n"Our northern and country manners, Sir Knight, do not permit us to\r\nexchange epithets with those to whom we are strangers," replied Mary\r\nAvenel.\r\n\r\n"Nay, but see now," said the knight, "how you are startled! even as the\r\nunbroken steed, which swerves aside from the shaking of a handkerchief,\r\nthough he must in time encounter the waving of a pennon. This courtly\r\nexchange of epithets of honour, is no more than the compliments which\r\npass between valour and beauty, wherever they meet, and under whatever\r\ncircumstances. Elizabeth of England herself calls Philip Sydney\r\nher Courage, and he in return calls that princess his Inspiration.\r\nWherefore, my fair Protection, for by such epithet it shall be mine to\r\ndenominate you--"\r\n\r\n"Not without the young lady\'s consent, sir!" interrupted Halbert; "most\r\ntruly do I hope your courtly and quaint breeding will not so far prevail\r\nover the more ordinary rules of civil behaviour."\r\n\r\n"Fair tenant of an indifferent copyhold," replied the knight, with the\r\nsame coolness and civility of mien, but in a tone somewhat more lofty\r\nthan he used to the young lady, "we do not in the southern parts, much\r\nintermingle discourse, save with those with whom we may stand on some\r\nfooting of equality; and I must, in all discretion, remind you, that the\r\nnecessity which makes us inhabitants of the same cabin, doth not place\r\nus otherwise on a level with each other."\r\n\r\n"By Saint Mary," replied young Glendinning, "it is my thought that it\r\ndoes; for plain men hold, that he who asks the shelter is indebted to\r\nhim who gives it; and so far, therefore, is our rank equalized while\r\nthis roof covers us both."\r\n\r\n"Thou art altogether deceived," answered Sir Piercie; "and that thou\r\nmayst fully adapt thyself to our relative condition, know that I account\r\nnot myself thy guest, but that of thy master, the Lord Abbot of Saint\r\nMary\'s, who, for reasons best known to himself and me, chooseth to\r\nadminister his hospitality to me through the means of thee, his servant\r\nand vassal, who art, therefore, in good truth, as passive an instrument\r\nof my accommodation as this ill-made and rugged joint-stool on which\r\nI sit, or as the wooden trencher from which I eat my coarse commons.\r\nWherefore," he added, turning to Mary, "fairest mistress, or rather,\r\nas I said before, most lovely Protection--" [Footnote: There are many\r\ninstances to be met with in the ancient dramas of this whimsical and\r\nconceited custom of persons who formed an intimacy, distinguishing:\r\neach, other by some quaint epithet. In _Every Man out of his Humour_,\r\nthere is a humorous debate upon names most fit to bind the relation\r\nbetwixt Sogliardo and Cavaliero Shift, which ends by adopting those of\r\nCountenance and Resolution. What is more to the point is in the speech\r\nof Hedon, a voluptuary and a courtier in _Cynthia\'s Revels_. "you\r\nknow that I call Madam Plilantia my _Honour,_ and she calls me her\r\n_Ambition._ Now, when I meet her in the presence, anon, I will come to\r\nher and say, \'Sweet Honour, I have hitherto contented my sense with the\r\nlilies of your hand, and now I will taste the roses of your lip.\' To\r\nwhich she cannot but blushing answer, \'Nay, now you are too ambitious;\'\r\nand then do I reply, \'I cannot be too ambitious of Honour, sweet lady.\r\nWilt not be good?\'"--I think there is some remnant of this foppery\r\npreserved in masonic lodges, where each brother is distinguished by a\r\nname in the Lodge, signifying some abstract quality as Discretion, or\r\nthe like. See the poems of Gavin Wilson.]\r\n\r\nMary Avenel was about to reply to him, when the stern, fierce, and\r\nresentful expression of voice and countenance with which Halbert\r\nexclaimed, "not from the King of Scotland, did he live, would I brook\r\nsuch terms!" induced her to throw herself between him and the stranger,\r\nexclaiming, "for God\'s sake, Halbert, beware what you do!"\r\n\r\n"Fear not, fairest Protection," replied Sir Piercie, with the utmost\r\nserenity, "that I can be provoked by this rustical and mistaught juvenal\r\nto do aught misbecoming your presence or mine own dignity; for as soon\r\nshall the gunner\'s linstock give fire unto the icicle, as the spark of\r\npassion inflame my blood, tempered as it is to serenity by the respect\r\ndue to the presence of my gracious Protection."\r\n\r\n"You may well call her your protection, Sir Knight" said Halbert; "by\r\nSaint Andrew, it is the only sensible word I have heard you speak! But\r\nwe may meet where her protection shall no longer afford you shelter."\r\n\r\n"Fairest Protection," continued the courtier, not even honouring with a\r\nlook, far less with a direct reply, the threat of the incensed Halbert,\r\n"doubt not that thy faithful Affability will be more commoved by the\r\nspeech of this rudesby, than the bright and serene moon is perturbed by\r\nthe baying of the cottage-cur, proud of the height of his own dunghill,\r\nwhich, in his conceit, lifteth him nearer unto the majestic luminary."\r\n\r\nTo what lengths so unsavoury a simile might have driven Halbert\'s\r\nindignation, is left uncertain; for at that moment Edward rushed into\r\nthe apartment with the intelligence that two most important officers\r\nof the Convent, the Kitchener and Refectioner, were just arrived with\r\na sumpter-mule, loaded with provisions, announcing that the Lord\r\nAbbot, the Sub-Prior, and the Sacristan, were on their way thither. A\r\ncircumstance so very extraordinary had never been recorded in the annals\r\nof Saint Mary\'s, or in the traditions of Glendearg, though there was a\r\nfaint legendary report that a certain Abbot had dined there in old days,\r\nafter having been bewildered in a hunting expedition amongst the wilds\r\nwhich lie to the northward. But that the present Lord Abbot should\r\nhave taken a voluntary journey to so wild and dreary a spot, the very\r\nKamtschatka of the Halidome, was a thing never dreamt of; and the news\r\nexcited the greatest surprise in all the members of the family saving\r\nHalbert alone.\r\n\r\nThis fiery youth was too full of the insult he had received to think of\r\nanything as unconnected with it. "I am glad of it," he exclaimed; "I\r\nam glad the Abbot comes hither. I will know of him by what right this\r\nstranger is sent hither to domineer over us under our father\'s roof, as\r\nif we were slaves and not freemen. I will tell the proud priest to his\r\nbeard--"\r\n\r\n"Alas! alas! my brother," said Edward, "think what these words may cost\r\nthee!"\r\n\r\n"And what will, or what can they cost me," said Halbert, "that I should\r\nsacrifice my human feelings and my justifiable resentment to the fear of\r\nwhat the Abbot can do?"\r\n\r\n"Our mother--our mother!" exclaimed Edward; "think, if she is deprived\r\nof her home, expelled from her property, how can you amend what your\r\nrashness may ruin?"\r\n\r\n"It is too true, by Heaven!" said Halbert, striking his forehead. Then,\r\nstamping his foot against the floor to express the full energy of the\r\npassion to which he dared no longer give vent, he turned round and left\r\nthe apartment.\r\n\r\nMary Avenel looked at the stranger knight, while she was endeavouring to\r\nframe a request that he would not report the intemperate violence of her\r\nfoster-brother to the prejudice of his family, in the mind of the Abbot.\r\nBut Sir Piercie, the very pink of courtesy, conjectured her meaning from\r\nher embarrassment, and waited not to be entreated.\r\n\r\n"Credit me, fairest Protection," said he, "your Affability is less than\r\ncapable of seeing or hearing, far less of reciting or reiterating, aught\r\nof an unseemly nature which may have chanced while I enjoyed the Elysium\r\nof your presence. The winds of idle passion may indeed rudely agitate\r\nthe bosom of the rude; but the heart of the courtier is polished to\r\nresist them. As the frozen lake receives not the influence of the\r\nbreeze, even so--"\r\n\r\nThe voice of Dame Glendinning, in shrill summons, here demanded Mary\r\nAvenel\'s attendance, who instantly obeyed, not a little glad to escape\r\nfrom the compliments and similes of this courtlike gallant. Nor was it\r\napparently less a relief on his part; for no sooner was she past\r\nthe threshold of the room, than he exchanged the look of formal and\r\nelaborate politeness which had accompanied each word he had uttered\r\nhitherto, for an expression of the utmost lassitude and ennui; and after\r\nindulging in one or two portentous yawns, broke forth into a soliloquy.\r\n\r\n"What the foul fiend sent this wench hither? As if it were not\r\nsufficient plague to be harboured in a hovel that would hardly serve for\r\na dog\'s kennel in England, baited by a rude peasant-boy, and dependent\r\non the faith of a mercenary ruffian, but I cannot even have time to\r\nmuse over my own mishap, but must come aloft, frisk, fidget, and make\r\nspeeches, to please this pale hectic phantom, because she has gentle\r\nblood in her veins? By mine honour, setting prejudice aside, the\r\nmill-wench is the more attractive of the two--But patienza, Piercie\r\nShafton; thou must not lose thy well-earned claim to be accounted\r\na devout servant of the fair sex, a witty-brained, prompt, and\r\naccomplished courtier. Rather thank heaven, Piercie Shafton, which hath\r\nsent thee a subject, wherein, without derogating from thy rank, (since\r\nthe honours of the Avenel family are beyond dispute,) thou mayest find\r\na whetstone for thy witty compliments, a strop whereon to sharpen thine\r\nacute engine, a butt whereat to shoot the arrows of thy gallantry. For\r\neven as a Bilboa blade, the more it is rubbed, the brighter and the\r\nsharper will it prove, so--But what need I waste my stock of similitudes\r\nin holding converse with myself?--Yonder comes the monkish retinue, like\r\nsome half score of crows winging their way slowly up the valley--I hope,\r\na\'gad, they have not forgotten my trunk-mails of apparel amid the ample\r\nprovision they have made for their own belly-timber--Mercy, a\'gad, I\r\nwere finely helped up if the vesture has miscarried among the thievish\r\nBorderers!"\r\n\r\nStung by this reflection, he ran hastily down stairs, and caused his\r\nhorse to be saddled, that he might, as soon as possible, ascertain this\r\nimportant point, by meeting the Lord Abbot and his retinue as they came\r\nup the glen. He had not ridden a mile before he met them advancing\r\nwith the slowness and decorum which became persons of their dignity and\r\nprofession. The knight failed not to greet the Lord Abbot with all\r\nthe formal compliments with which men of rank at that period exchanged\r\ncourtesies. He had the good fortune to find that his mails were numbered\r\namong the train of baggage which attended upon the party; and, satisfied\r\nin that particular, he turned his horse\'s head, and accompanied the\r\nAbbot to the Tower of Glendearg.\r\n\r\nGreat, in the meanwhile, had been the turmoil of the good Dame Elspeth\r\nand her coadjutors, to prepare for the fitting reception of the Father\r\nLord Abbot and his retinue. The monks had indeed taken care not to trust\r\ntoo much to the state of her pantry; but she was not the less anxious\r\nto make such additions as might enable her to claim the thanks of her\r\nfeudal lord and spiritual father. Meeting Halbert, as, with his blood on\r\nfire, he returned from his altercation with her guest, she commanded him\r\ninstantly to go forth to the hill, and not to return without venison;\r\nreminding him that he was apt enough to go thither for his own pleasure,\r\nand must now do so for the credit of the house.\r\n\r\nThe Miller, who was now hastening his journey homewards, promised to\r\nsend up some salmon by his own servant. Dame Elspeth, who by this time\r\nthought she had guests enough, had begun to repent of her invitation\r\nto poor Mysie, and was just considering by what means, short of giving\r\noffence, she could send off the Maid of the Mill behind her father, and\r\nadjourn all her own aerial architecture till some future opportunity,\r\nwhen this unexpected generosity on the part of the sire rendered\r\nany present attempt to return his daughter on his hands too highly\r\nungracious to be farther thought on. So the Miller departed alone on his\r\nhomeward journey.\r\n\r\nDame Elspeth\'s sense of hospitality proved in this instance its own\r\nreward; for Mysie had dwelt too near the Convent to be altogether\r\nignorant of the noble art of cookery, which her father patronized to the\r\nextent of consuming on festival days such dainties as his daughter could\r\nprepare in emulation of the luxuries of the Abbot\'s kitchen. Laying\r\naside, therefore, her holiday kirtle, and adopting a dress more suitable\r\nto the occasion, the good-humored maiden bared her snowy arms above the\r\nelbows; and, as Elspeth acknowledged, in the language of the time and\r\ncountry, took "entire and aefauld part with her" in the labours of the\r\nday; showing unparalleled talent, and indefatigable industry, in\r\nthe preparation of _mortreux_, _blanc-manger_, and heaven knows what\r\ndelicacies besides, which Dame Glendinning, unassisted by her skill,\r\ndared not even have dreamt of presenting. Leaving this able substitute\r\nin the kitchen, and regretting that Mary Avenel was so brought up, that\r\nshe could intrust nothing to her care, unless it might be seeing the\r\ngreat chamber strewed with rushes, and ornamented with such flowers and\r\nbranches as the season afforded, Dame Elspeth hastily donned her best\r\nattire, and with a beating heart presented herself at the door of her\r\nlittle tower, to make her obeisance to the Lord Abbot as he crossed\r\nher humble threshold. Edward stood by his mother, and felt the same\r\npalpitation, which his philosophy was at a loss to account for. He was\r\nyet to learn how long it is ere our reason is enabled to triumph over\r\nthe force of external circumstances, and how much our feelings are\r\naffected by novelty, and blunted by use and habit.\r\n\r\nOn the present occasion, he witnessed with wonder and awe the approach\r\nof some half-score of riders, sober men upon sober palfreys, muffled in\r\ntheir long black garments, and only relieved by their white scapularies,\r\nshowing more like a funeral procession than aught else, and not\r\nquickening their pace beyond that which permitted easy conversation and\r\neasy digestion. The sobriety of the scene was indeed somewhat enlivened\r\nby the presence of Sir Piercie Shafton, who, to show that his skill\r\nin the manege was not inferior to his other accomplishments, kept\r\nalternately pressing and checking his gay courser, forcing him to\r\npiaffe, to caracole, to passage, and to do all the other feats of the\r\nschool, to the great annoyance of the Lord Abbot, the wonted sobriety\r\nof whose palfrey became at length discomposed by the vivacity of its\r\ncompanion, while the dignitary kept crying out in bodily alarm, "I do\r\npray you--Sir Knight--good now, Sir Piercie--Be quiet, Benedict, there\r\nis a good steed--soh, poor fellow" and uttering all the other precatory\r\nand soothing exclamations by which a timid horseman usually bespeaks the\r\nfavour of a frisky companion, or of his own unquiet nag, and concluding\r\nthe bead-roll with a sincere _Deo gratias_ so soon as he alighted in the\r\ncourt-yard of the Tower of Glendearg.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants unanimously knelt down to kiss the hand of the Lord\r\nAbbot, a ceremony which even the monks were often condemned to. Good\r\nAbbot Boniface was too much fluttered by the incidents of the latter\r\npart of his journey, to go through this ceremony with much solemnity,\r\nor indeed with much patience. He kept wiping his brow with a snow-white\r\nhandkerchief with one hand, while another was abandoned to the homage of\r\nhis vassals; and then signing the cross with his outstretched arm,\r\nand exclaiming, "Bless ye--bless ye, my children" he hastened into the\r\nhouse, and murmured not a little at the darkness and steepness of the\r\nrugged winding stair, whereby he at length scaled the spence destined\r\nfor his entertainment, and, overcome with fatigue, threw himself, I do\r\nnot say into an easy chair, but into the easiest the apartment afforded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter the Sixteenth.\r\n\r\n\r\n     A courtier extraordinary, who by diet\r\n     Of meats and drinks, his temperate exercise,\r\n     Choice music, frequent bath, his horary shifts\r\n     Of shirts and waistcoats, means to immortalize\r\n     Mortality itself, and makes the essence\r\n     Of his whole happiness the trim of court.\r\n                                         MAGNETIC LADY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the Lord Abbot had suddenly and superciliously vanished from\r\nthe eyes of his expectant vassals, the Sub-Prior made amends for the\r\nnegligence of his principal, by the kind and affectionate greeting\r\nwhich he gave to all the members of the family, but especially to Dame\r\nElspeth, her foster-daughter, and her son Edward. "Where," he even\r\ncondescended to inquire, "is that naughty Nimrod, Halbert?--He hath\r\nnot yet, I trust, turned, like his great prototype, his hunting-spear\r\nagainst man!"\r\n\r\n"O no, an it please your reverence," said Dame Glendinning, "Halbert\r\nis up at the glen to get some venison, or surely he would not have been\r\nabsent when such a day of honour dawned upon me and mine."\r\n\r\n"Oh, to get savoury meat, such as our soul loveth," muttered the\r\nSub-Prior; "it has been at times an acceptable gift.--I bid you good\r\nmorrow, my good dame, as I must attend upon his lordship the Father\r\nAbbot."\r\n\r\n"And O, reverend sir," said the good widow, detaining him, "if it might\r\nbe your pleasure to take part with us if there is any thing wrong; and\r\nif there is any thing wanted, to say that it is just coming, or to make\r\nsome excuses your learning best knows how. Every bit of vassail and\r\nsilver work have we been spoiled of since Pinkie Cleuch, when I lost\r\npoor Simon Glendinning, that was the warst of a\'."\r\n\r\n"Never mind--never fear," said the Sub-Prior, gently extricating his\r\ngarment from the anxious grasp of Dame Elspeth, "the Refectioner has\r\nwith him the Abbot\'s plate and drinking cups; and I pray you to believe\r\nthat whatever is short in your entertainment will be deemed amply made\r\nup in your good-will."\r\n\r\nSo saying, he escaped from her and went into the spence, where such\r\npreparations as haste permitted were making for the noon collation of\r\nthe Abbot and the English knight. Here he found the Lord Abbot, for whom\r\na cushion, composed of all the plaids in the house, had been unable to\r\nrender Simon\'s huge elbow-chair a soft or comfortable place of rest.\r\n\r\n"Benedicite!" said Abbot Boniface, "now marry fie upon these hard\r\nbenches with all my heart--they are as uneasy as the _scabella_ of our\r\nnovices. Saint Jude be with us, Sir Knight, how have you contrived to\r\npass over the night in this dungeon? An your bed was no softer than your\r\nseat, you might as well have slept on the stone couch of Saint Pacomius.\r\nAfter trotting a full ten miles, a man needs a softer seat than has\r\nfallen to my hard lot."\r\n\r\nWith sympathizing faces, the Sacristan and the Refectioner ran to raise\r\nthe Lord Abbot, and to adjust his seat to his mind, which was at length\r\naccomplished in some sort, although he continued alternately to bewail\r\nhis fatigue, and to exult in the conscious sense of having discharged\r\nan arduous duty. "You errant cavaliers," said he, addressing the knight,\r\n"may now perceive that others have their travail and their toils to\r\nundergo as well as your honoured faculty. And this I will say for myself\r\nand the soldiers of Saint Mary, among whom I may be termed captain,\r\nthat it is not our wont to flinch from the heat of the service, or to\r\nwithdraw from the good fight. No, by Saint Mary!--no sooner did I\r\nlearn that you were here, and dared not for certain reasons come to the\r\nMonastery, where, with as good will, and with more convenience, we might\r\nhave given you a better reception, than, striking the table with\r\nmy hammer, I called a brother--Timothy, said I, let them saddle\r\nBenedict--let them saddle my black palfrey, and bid the Sub-Prior and\r\nsome half-score of attendants be in readiness tomorrow after matins--we\r\nwould ride to Glendearg.--Brother Timothy stared, thinking, I imagine,\r\nthat his ears had scarce done him justice--but I repeated my commands,\r\nand said, Let the Kitchener and Refectioner go before to aid the poor\r\nvassals to whom the place belongs in making a suitable collation. So\r\nthat you will consider, good Sir Piercie, our mutual in commodities, and\r\nforgive whatever you may find amiss."\r\n\r\n"By my faith," said Sir Piercie Shafton, "there is nothing to\r\nforgive--If you spiritual warriors have to submit to the grievous\r\nincommodities which your lordship narrates, it would ill become me,\r\na sinful and secular man, to complain of a bed as hard as a board, of\r\nbroth which relished as if made of burnt wool, of flesh, which, in\r\nits sable and singed shape, seemed to put me on a level with Richard\r\nCoeur-de-Lion,--when he ate up the head of a Moor carbonadoed, and of\r\nother viands savouring rather of the rusticity of this northern region."\r\n\r\n"By the good Saints, sir," said the Abbot, somewhat touched in point of\r\nhis character for hospitality, of which he was in truth a most faithful\r\nand zealous professor, "it grieves me to the heart that you have found\r\nour vassals no better provided for your reception--Yet I crave leave\r\nto observe, that if Sir Piercie Shafton\'s affairs had permitted him to\r\nhonour with his company our poor house of Saint Mary\'s, he might have\r\nhad less to complain of in respect of easements."\r\n\r\n"To give your lordship the reasons," said Sir Piercie Shafton, "why I\r\ncould not at this present time approach your dwelling, or avail myself\r\nof its well-known and undoubted hospitality, craves either some delay,\r\nor," looking around him, "a limited audience."\r\n\r\nThe Lord Abbot immediately issued his mandate to the Refectioner: "Hie\r\nthee to the kitchen, Brother Hilarius, and there make inquiry of our\r\nbrother the Kitchener, within what time he opines that our collation may\r\nbe prepared, since sin and sorrow it were, considering the hardships of\r\nthis noble and gallant knight, no whit mentioning or--weighing those we\r\nourselves have endured, if we were now either to advance or retard the\r\nhour of refection beyond the time when the viands are fit to be set\r\nbefore us."\r\n\r\nBrother Hilarius parted with an eager alertness to execute the will of\r\nhis Superior, and returned with the assurance, that punctually at one\r\nafternoon would the collation be ready.\r\n\r\n"Before that time," said the accurate Refectioner, "the wafers, flamms,\r\nand pastry-meat, will scarce have had the just degree of fire which\r\nlearned pottingers prescribe as fittest for the body; and if it should\r\nbe past one o\'clock, were it but ten minutes, our brother the Kitchener\r\nopines, that the haunch of venison would suffer in spite of the skill of\r\nthe little turn-broche whom he has recommended to your holiness by his\r\npraises."\r\n\r\n"How!" said the Abbot, "a haunch of venison!--from whence comes that\r\ndainty? I remember not thou didst intimate its presence in thy hamper of\r\nvivers."\r\n\r\n"So please your holiness and lordship," said the Refectioner, "he is a\r\nson of the woman of the house who has shot it and sent it in--killed\r\nbut now; yet, as the animal heat hath not left the body, the Kitchener\r\nundertakes it shall eat as tender as a young chicken--and this youth\r\nhath a special gift in shooting deer, and never misses the heart or the\r\nbrain; so that the blood is not driven through the flesh, as happens\r\ntoo often with us. It is a hart of grease--your holiness has seldom seen\r\nsuch a haunch."\r\n\r\n"Silence, Brother Hilarius," said the Abbot, wiping his mouth; "it is\r\nnot beseeming our order to talk of food so earnestly, especially as we\r\nmust oft have our animal powers exhausted by fasting, and be accessible\r\n(as being ever mere mortals) to those signs of longing" (he again\r\nwiped his mouth) "which arise on the mention of victuals to an hungry\r\nman.--Minute down, however, the name of that youth--it is fitting merit\r\nshould be rewarded, and he shall hereafter be a _frater ad succurrendum_\r\nin the kitchen and buttery."\r\n\r\n"Alas! reverend Father and my good lord," replied the Refectioner,\r\n"I did inquire after the youth, and I learn he is one who prefers the\r\ncasque to the cowl, and the sword of the flesh to the weapons of the\r\nspirit."\r\n\r\n"And if it be so," said the Abbot, "see that thou retain him as\r\na deputy-keeper and man-at-arms, and not as a lay brother of the\r\nMonastery--for old Tallboy, our forester, waxes dim-eyed, and hath twice\r\nspoiled a noble buck, by hitting him unwarily on the haunch. Ah! \'tis a\r\nfoul fault, the abusing by evil-killing, evil-dressing, evil-appetite,\r\nor otherwise, the good creatures indulged to us for our use. Wherefore,\r\nsecure us the service of this youth, Brother Hilarius, in the way that\r\nmay best suit him.--And now, Sir Piercie Shafton, since the fates have\r\nassigned us a space of well-nigh an hour, ere we dare hope to enjoy\r\nmore than the vapour or savour of our repast, may I pray you, of your\r\ncourtesy, to tell me the cause of this visit; and, above all, to inform\r\nus, why you will not approach our more pleasant and better furnished\r\n_hospitium_?"\r\n\r\n"Reverend Father, and my very good lord," said Sir Piercie Shafton,\r\n"it is well known to your wisdom, that there are stone walls which have\r\nears, and that secrecy is to be looked to in matters which concern\r\na man\'s head." The Abbot signed to his attendants, excepting the\r\nSub-Prior, to leave the room, and then said, "Your valour, Sir Piercie,\r\nmay freely unburden yourself before our faithful friend and counsellor\r\nFather Eustace, the benefits of whose advice we may too soon lose,\r\ninasmuch as his merits will speedily recommend him to an higher station,\r\nin which we trust he may find the blessing of a friend and adviser as\r\nvaluable as himself, since I may say of him, as our claustral rhyme\r\ngoeth,[Footnote: The rest of this doggerel rhyme may be found in\r\nFosbrooke\'s Learned work on British Monachism.]\r\n\r\n  \'Dixit Abbas ad Prioris,\r\n  Tu es homo boni moris,\r\n  Quia semper sanioris\r\n  Mihi das concilia.\'\r\n\r\nIndeed," he added, "the office of Sub-Prior is altogether beneath our\r\ndear brother; nor can we elevate him unto that of Prior, which, for\r\ncertain reasons, is at present kept vacant amongst us. Howbeit, Father\r\nEustace is fully possessed of my confidence, and worthy of yours, and\r\nwell may it be said of him, _Intravit in secretis nostris_."\r\n\r\nSir Piercie Shafton bowed to the reverend brethren, and, heaving a sigh,\r\nas if he would burst his steel cuirass, he thus commenced his speech:--\r\n\r\n"Certes, reverend sirs, I may well heave such a suspiration, who have,\r\nas it were, exchanged heaven for purgatory, leaving the lightsome sphere\r\nof the royal court of England for a remote nook in this inaccessible\r\ndesert--quitting the tilt-yard, where I was ever ready among my compeers\r\nto splinter a lance, either for the love of honour, or for the honour\r\nof love, in order to couch my knightly spear against base and pilfering\r\nbesognios and marauders--exchanging the lighted halls, wherein I used\r\nnimbly to pace the swift coranto, or to move with a loftier grace in the\r\nstately galliard, for this rugged and decayed dungeon of rusty-coloured\r\nstone--quitting the gay theatre, for the solitary chimney-nook of a\r\nScottish dog-house--bartering the sounds of the soul-ravishing lute, and\r\nthe love-awaking viol-de-gamba, for the discordant squeak of a northern\r\nbagpipe--above all, exchanging the smiles of those beauties, who form\r\na gay galaxy around the throne of England, for the cold courtesy of an\r\nuntaught damsel, and the bewildered stare of a miller\'s maiden. More\r\nmight I say of the exchange of the conversation of gallant knights and\r\ngay courtiers of mine own order and capacity, whose conceits are bright\r\nand vivid as the lightning, for that of monks and churchmen--but it were\r\ndiscourteous to urge that topic."\r\n\r\nThe Abbot listened to this list of complaints with great round eyes,\r\nwhich evinced no exact intelligence of the orator\'s meaning; and\r\nwhen the knight paused to take breath, he looked with a doubtful and\r\ninquiring eye at the Sub-Prior, not well knowing in what tone he should\r\nreply to an exordium so extraordinary. The Sub-Prior accordingly stepped\r\nin to the relief of his principal.\r\n\r\n"We deeply sympathize with you, Sir Knight, in the several\r\nmortifications and hardships to which fate has subjected you,\r\nparticularly in that which has thrown you into the society of those,\r\nwho, as they were conscious they deserved not such an honour, so neither\r\ndid they at all desire it. But all this goes little way to expound the\r\ncause of this train of disasters, or, in plainer words, the reason which\r\nhas compelled you into a situation having so few charms for you."\r\n\r\n"Gentle and reverend sir," replied the knight, "forgive an unhappy\r\nperson, who, in giving a history of his miseries, dilateth upon them\r\nextremely, even as he who, having fallen from a precipice, looketh\r\nupward to measure the height from which he hath been precipitated."\r\n\r\n"Yea, but," said Father Eustace, "methinks it were wiser in him to tell\r\nthose who come to lift him up, which of his bones have been broken."\r\n\r\n"You, reverend sir," said the knight, "have, in the encounter of our\r\nwits, made a fair attaint; whereas I may be in some sort said to have\r\nbroken my staff across. [Footnote: _Attaint_ was a term of tilting\r\nused to express the champion\'s having _attained_ his mark, or, in other\r\nwords, struck his lance straight and fair against the helmet or breast\r\nof his adversary. Whereas to break the lance across, intimated a total\r\nfailure in directing the point of the weapon on the object of his aim.]\r\nPardon me, grave sir, that I speak in the language of the tilt-yard,\r\nwhich is doubtless strange to your reverend years.--Ah! brave resort\r\nof the noble, the fair and the gay!--Ah! throne of love, and citadel\r\nof honour!--Ah! celestial beauties, by whose bright eyes it is graced!\r\nNever more shall Piercie Shafton advance, as the centre of your radiant\r\nglances, couch his lance, and spur his horse at the sound of the\r\nspirit-stirring trumpets, nobly called the voice of war--never more\r\nshall he baffle his adversary\'s encounter boldly, break his spear\r\ndexterously, and ambling around the lovely circle, receive the rewards\r\nwith which beauty honours chivalry!"\r\n\r\nHere he paused, wrung his hands, looked upwards, and seemed lost in\r\ncontemplation of his own fallen fortunes.\r\n\r\n"Mad, very mad," whispered the Abbot to the Sub-Prior; "I would we were\r\nfairly rid of him; for, of a truth, I expect he will proceed from raving\r\nto mischief--Were it not better to call up the rest of the brethren?"\r\n\r\nBut the Sub-Prior knew better than his Superior how to distinguish the\r\njargon of affectation from the ravings of insanity, and although the\r\nextremity of the knight\'s passion seemed altogether fantastic, yet\r\nhe was not ignorant to what extravagancies the fashion of the day can\r\nconduct its votaries.\r\n\r\nAllowing, therefore, two minutes\' space to permit the knight\'s\r\nenthusiastic feelings to exhaust themselves, he again gravely reminded\r\nhim that the Lord Abbot had taken a journey, unwonted to his age and\r\nhabits, solely to learn in what he could serve Sir Piercie Shafton--that\r\nit was altogether impossible he could do so without his receiving\r\ndistinct information of the situation in which he had now sought refuge\r\nin Scotland.--"The day wore on," he observed, looking at the window;\r\n"and if the Abbot should be obliged to return to the Monastery without\r\nobtaining the necessary intelligence, the regret might be mutual, but\r\nthe inconvenience was like to be all on Sir Piercie\'s own side."\r\n\r\nThe hint was not thrown away.\r\n\r\n"O, goddess of courtesy!" said the knight, "can I so far have forgotten\r\nthy behests as to make this good prelate\'s ease and time a sacrifice to\r\nmy vain complaints! Know, then, most worthy, and not less worshipful,\r\nthat I, your poor visitor and guest, am by birth nearly bound to the\r\nPiercie of Northumberland, whose fame is so widely blown through all\r\nparts of the world where English worth hath been known. Now, this\r\npresent Earl of Northumberland, of whom I propose to give you the brief\r\nhistory----"\r\n\r\n"It is altogether unnecessary," said the Abbot; "we know him to be a\r\ngood and true nobleman, and a sworn upholder of our Catholic faith,\r\nin the spite of the heretical woman who now sits upon the throne of\r\nEngland. And it is specially as his kinsman, and as knowing that ye\r\npartake with him in such devout and faithful belief and adherence to our\r\nholy Mother Church, that we say to you, Sir Piercie Shafton, that ye be\r\nheartily welcome to us, and that, and we wist how, we would labour to do\r\nyou good service in your extremity."\r\n\r\n"For such kind offer I rest your most humble debtor," said Sir Piercie,\r\n"nor need I at this moment say more than that my Right Honourable Cousin\r\nof Northumberland, having devised with me and some others, the choice\r\nand picked spirits of the age, how and by what means the worship of God,\r\naccording to the Catholic Church, might be again introduced into this\r\ndistracted kingdom of England, (even as one deviseth, by the assistance\r\nof his friend, to catch and bridle a runaway steed,) it pleased him so\r\ndeeply to intrust me in those communications, that my personal safety\r\nbecomes, as it were, entwined or complicated therewith. Natheless, as\r\nwe have had sudden reason to believe, this Princess Elizabeth, who\r\nmaintaineth around her a sort of counsellors skilful in tracking\r\nwhatever schemes may be pursued for bringing her title into challenge,\r\nor for erecting again the discipline of the Catholic Church, has\r\nobtained certain knowledge of the trains which we had laid before we\r\ncould give fire unto them. Wherefore, my Right Honourable Cousin of\r\nNorthumberland, thinking it best belike that one man should take\r\nboth blame and shame for the whole, did lay the burden of all this\r\ntrafficking upon my back; which load I am the rather content to bear,\r\nin that he hath always shown himself my kind and honourable kinsman,\r\nas well as that my estate, I wot not how, hath of late been somewhat\r\ninsufficient to maintain the expense of those braveries, wherewith it\r\nis incumbent on us, who are chosen and selected spirits, to distinguish\r\nourselves from the vulgar."\r\n\r\n"So that possibly," said the Sub-Prior, "your private affairs rendered a\r\nforeign journey less incommodious to you than it might have been to the\r\nnoble earl, your right worthy cousin?"\r\n\r\n"You are right, reverend sir," answered the courtier; "_rem acu_--you\r\nhave touched the point with a needle--My cost and expenses had been\r\nindeed somewhat lavish at the late triumphs and tourneys, and the\r\nflat-capp\'d citizens had shown themselves unwilling to furnish my pocket\r\nfor new gallantries for the honour of the nation, as well as for mine\r\nown peculiar glory--and, to speak truth, it was in some part the hope\r\nof seeing these matters amended that led me to desire a new world in\r\nEngland."\r\n\r\n"So that the miscarriage of your public enterprise, with the derangement\r\nof your own private affairs," said the Sub-Prior, "have induced you to\r\nseek Scotland as a place of refuge?"\r\n\r\n"_Rem acu_, once again," said Sir Piercie; "and not without good cause,\r\nsince my neck, if I remained, might have been brought within the\r\ncircumstances of a halter--and so speedy was my journey northward, that\r\nI had but time to exchange my peach-coloured doublet of Genoa velvet,\r\nthickly laid over with goldsmith\'s work, for this cuirass, which was\r\nmade by Bonamico of Milan, and travelled northward with all speed,\r\njudging that I might do well to visit my Right Honourable Cousin of\r\nNorthumberland, at one of his numerous castles. But as I posted towards\r\nAlnwick, even with the speed of a star, which, darting from its native\r\nsphere, shoots wildly downwards, I was met at Northallerton by one Henry\r\nVaughan, a servant of my right honourable kinsman, who showed me, that\r\nas then I might not with safety come to his presence, seeing that, in\r\nobedience to orders from his court, he was obliged to issue out letters\r\nfor my incarceration."\r\n\r\n"This," said the Abbot, "seems but hard measure on the part of your\r\nhonourable kinsman."\r\n\r\n"It might be so judged, my lord," replied Sir Piercie; "nevertheless, I\r\nwill stand to the death for the honour of my Right Honourable Cousin of\r\nNorthumberland. Also, Henry Vaughan gave me, from my said cousin, a\r\ngood horse, and a purse of gold, with two Border-prickers, as they are\r\ncalled, for my guides, who conducted me, by such roads and by-paths as\r\nhave never been seen since the days of Sir Lancelot and Sir Tristrem,\r\ninto this kingdom of Scotland, and to the house of a certain baron, or\r\none who holds the style of such, called Julian Avenel, with whom I found\r\nsuch reception as the place and party could afford."\r\n\r\n"And that," said the Abbot, "must have been right wretched; for to\r\njudge from the appetite which Julian showeth when abroad, he hath not, I\r\njudge, over-abundant provision at home."\r\n\r\n"You are right, sir--your reverence is in the right," continued Sir\r\nPiercie; "we had but lenten fare, and, what was worse, a score to\r\nclear at the departure; for though this Julian Avenel called us to\r\nno reckoning, yet he did so extravagantly admire the fashion of my\r\nponiard--the _poignet_ being of silver exquisitely hatched, and indeed\r\nthe weapon being altogether a piece of exceeding rare device and\r\nbeauty--that in faith I could not for very shame\'s sake but pray his\r\nacceptance of it; words which he gave me not the trouble of repeating\r\ntwice, before he had stuck it into his greasy buff-belt, where,\r\ncredit me, reverend sir, it showed more like a butcher\'s knife than a\r\ngentleman\'s dagger."\r\n\r\n"So goodly a gift might at least have purchased you a few days\'\r\nhospitality," said Father Eustace.\r\n\r\n"Reverend sir," said Sir Piercie, "had I abidden with him, I should have\r\nbeen complimented out of every remnant of my wardrobe--actually flayed,\r\nby the hospitable gods I swear it! Sir, he secured my spare doublet, and\r\nhad a pluck at my galligaskins--I was enforced to beat a retreat before\r\nI was altogether unrigged. That Border knave, his serving man, had\r\na pluck at me too, and usurped a scarlet cassock and steel cuirass\r\nbelonging to the page of my body, whom I was fain to leave behind me. In\r\ngood time I received a letter from my Right Honourable Cousin, showing\r\nme that he had written to you in my behalf, and sent to your charge two\r\nmails filled with wearing apparel--namely, my rich crimson silk doublet,\r\nslashed out and lined with cloth of gold, which I wore at the last\r\nrevels, with baldric and trimmings to correspond--also two pair\r\nblack silk slops, with hanging garters of carnation silk--also the\r\nflesh-coloured silken doublet, with the trimmings of fur, in which I\r\ndanced the salvage man at the Gray\'s-Inn mummery--also----"\r\n\r\n"Sir Knight," said the Sub-Prior, "I pray you to spare the farther\r\ninventory of your wardrobe. The monks of Saint Mary\'s are no\r\nfree-booting barons, and whatever part of your vestments arrived at\r\nour house, have been this day faithfully brought hither, with the mails\r\nwhich contained them. I may presume from what has been said, as we have\r\nindeed been, given to understand by the Earl of Northumberland, that\r\nyour desire is to remain for the present as unknown and as unnoticed, as\r\nmay be consistent with your high worth and distinction?"\r\n\r\n"Alas, reverend father!" replied the courtier, "a blade when it is in\r\nthe scabbard cannot give lustre, a diamond when it is in the casket\r\ncannot give light, and worth, when it is compelled by circumstances to\r\nobscure itself, cannot draw observation--my retreat can only attract\r\nthe admiration of those few to whom circumstances permit its displaying\r\nitself."\r\n\r\n"I conceive now, my venerable father and lord," said the Sub-Prior,\r\n"that your wisdom will assign such a course of conduct to this noble\r\nknight, as may be alike consistent with his safety, and with the weal of\r\nthe community. For you wot well, that perilous strides have been made\r\nin these audacious days, to the destruction of all ecclesiastical\r\nfoundations, and that our holy community has been repeatedly menaced.\r\nHitherto they have found no flaw in our raiment; but a party, friendly\r\nas well to the Queen of England, as to the heretical doctrines of\r\nthe schismatical church, or even to worse and wilder forms of heresy,\r\nprevails now at the court of our sovereign, who dare not yield to her\r\nsuffering clergy the protection she would gladly extend to them."\r\n\r\n"My lord, and reverend sir," said the knight, "I will gladly relieve\r\nyou of my presence, while ye canvass this matter at your freedom; and\r\nto speak truly, I am desirous to see in what case the chamberlain of my\r\nnoble kinsman hath found my wardrobe, and how he hath packed the same,\r\nand whether it has suffered from the journey--there are four suits of\r\nas pure and elegant device as ever the fancy of a fair lady doated upon,\r\nevery one having a treble, and appropriate change of ribbons, trimmings,\r\nand fringes, which, in case of need, may as it were renew each of\r\nthem, and multiply the four into twelve.--There is also my sad-coloured\r\nriding-suit, and three cut-work shirts with falling bands--I pray you,\r\npardon me--I must needs see how matters stand with them without farther\r\ndallying."\r\n\r\nThus speaking, he left the room; and the Sub-Prior, looking after him\r\nsignificantly, added, "Where the treasure is will the heart be also."\r\n\r\n"Saint Mary preserve our wits!" said the Abbot, stunned with the\r\nknight\'s abundance of words; "were man\'s brains ever so stuffed with\r\nsilk and broadcloth, cut-work, and I wot not what besides! And\r\nwhat could move the Earl of Northumberland to assume for his bosom\r\ncounsellor, in matters of death and danger, such a feather-brained\r\ncoxcomb as this?"\r\n\r\n"Had he been other than what he is, venerable father," said the\r\nSub-Prior, "he had been less fitted for the part of scape-goat, to\r\nwhich his Right Honourable Cousin had probably destined him from the\r\ncommencement, in case of their plot failing. I know something of this\r\nPiercie Shafton. The legitimacy of his mother\'s descent from the Piercie\r\nfamily, the point on which he is most jealous, hath been called in\r\nquestion. If hairbrained courage, and an outrageous spirit of gallantry,\r\ncan make good his pretensions to the high lineage he claims, these\r\nqualities have never been denied him. For the rest, he is one of the\r\nruffling gallants of the time, like Howland Yorke, Stukely,\r\n\r\n[Footnote: "Yorke," says Camden, "was a Londoner, a man of loose and\r\ndissolute behaviour, and desperately audacious--famous in his time\r\namongst the common bullies and swaggerers, as being the first that, to\r\nthe great admiration of many at his boldness, brought into England the\r\nbold and dangerous way of fencing with the rapier in duelling. Whereas,\r\ntill that time, the English used to fight with long swords and bucklers,\r\nstriking with the edge, and thought it no part of man either to push or\r\nstrike beneath the girdle.\r\n\r\nHaving a command in the Low Countries, Yorke revolted to the Spaniards,\r\nand died miserably, poisoned, as was supposed, by his new allies. Three\r\nyears afterwards, his bones were dug up and gibbeted by the command of\r\nthe States of Holland.\r\n\r\nThomas Stukely, another distinguished gallant of the time, was bred a\r\nmerchant, being the son of a rich clothier in the west. He wedded the\r\ndaughter and heiress of a wealthy alderman of London, named Curtis,\r\nafter whose death he squandered the riches he thus acquired in all\r\nmanner of extravagance. His wife, whose fortune supplied his waste,\r\nrepresented to him that he ought to make more of her. Stukely replied,\r\n"I will make as much of thee, believe me, as it is possible for any to\r\ndo;" and he kept his word in one sense, having stripped her even of her\r\nwearing apparel, before he finally ran away from her.\r\n\r\nHaving fled to Italy, he contrived to impose upon the Pope, with a\r\nplan of invading Ireland, for which he levied soldiers, and made some\r\npreparations, but ended by engaging himself and his troops in the\r\nservice of King Sebastian of Portugal. He sailed with that prince on his\r\nfatal voyage to Barbary, and fell with him at the battle of Alcazar.\r\n\r\nStukely, as one of the first gallants of the time, has had the honour\r\nto be chronicled in song, in Evans\' Old Ballads, vol. iii, edition 1810.\r\nHis fate is also introduced in a tragedy, by George Peel, as has been\r\nsupposed, called the Battle of Alcazar, from which play Dryden is\r\nalleged to have taken the idea of Don Sebastian; if so, it is surprising\r\nhe omitted a character so congenial to King Charles the Second\'s time as\r\nthe witty, brave, and profligate Thomas Stukely.]\r\n\r\nand others, who wear out their fortunes, and endanger their lives,\r\nin idle braveries, in order that they may be esteemed the only choice\r\ngallants of the time; and afterwards endeavour to repair their estate,\r\nby engaging in the desperate plots and conspiracies which wiser\r\nheads have devised. To use one of his own conceited similitudes, such\r\ncourageous fools resemble hawks, which the wiser conspirator keeps\r\nhooded and blinded on his wrist until the quarry is on the wing, and who\r\nare then flown at them."\r\n\r\n"Saint Mary," said the Abbot, "he were an evil guest to introduce into\r\nour quiet household. Our young monks make bustle enough, and more than\r\nis beseeming God\'s servants, about their outward attire already--this\r\nknight were enough to turn their brains, from the _Vestiarius_ down to\r\nthe very scullion boy."\r\n\r\n"A worse evil might follow," said the Sub-Prior: "in these bad days, the\r\npatrimony of the church is bought and sold, forfeited and distrained,\r\nas if it were the unhallowed soil appertaining to a secular baron. Think\r\nwhat penalty awaits us, were we convicted of harbouring a rebel to her\r\nwhom they call the Queen of England! There would neither be wanting\r\nScottish parasites to beg the lands of the foundation, nor an army from\r\nEngland to burn and harry the Halidome. The men of Scotland were once\r\nScotsmen, firm and united in the love of their country, and throwing\r\nevery other consideration aside when the frontier was menaced--now\r\nthey are--what shall I call them--the one part French, the other\r\npart English, considering their dear native country merely as a\r\nprize-fighting stage, upon which foreigners are welcome to decide their\r\nquarrels."\r\n\r\n"Benedictine!" replied the Abbot, "they are indeed slippery and evil\r\ntimes."\r\n\r\n"And therefore," said Father Eustace, "we must walk warily--we must not,\r\nfor example, bring this man--this Sir Piercie Shafton, to our house of\r\nSaint Mary\'s."\r\n\r\n"But how then shall we dispose of him?" replied the Abbot; "bethink thee\r\nthat he is a sufferer for holy Church\'s sake--that his patron, the Earl\r\nof Northumberland, hath been our friend, and that, lying so near us, he\r\nmay work us weal or wo according as we deal with his kinsman."\r\n\r\n"And, accordingly," said the Sub-Prior, "for these reasons, as well as\r\nfor discharge of the great duty of Christian charity, I would protect\r\nand relieve this man. Let him not go back to Julian Avenel--that\r\nunconscientious baron would not stick to plunder the exiled\r\nstranger--Let him remain here--the spot is secluded, and if the\r\naccommodation be beneath his quality, discovery will become the less\r\nlikely. We will make such means for his convenience as we can devise."\r\n\r\n"Will he be persuaded, thinkest thou?" said the Abbot; "I will leave my\r\nown travelling bed for his repose, and send up a suitable easy-chair."\r\n\r\n"With such easements," said the Sub-Prior, "he must not complain; and\r\nthen, if threatened by any sudden danger, he can soon come down to\r\nthe sanctuary, where we will harbour him in secret until means can be\r\ndevised of dismissing him in safety."\r\n\r\n"Were we not better," said the Abbot, "send him on to the court, and get\r\nrid of him at once?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, but at the expense of our friends--this butterfly may fold his\r\nwings, and lie under cover in the cold air of Glendearg; but were he\r\nat Holyrood, he would, did his life depend on it, expand his spangled\r\ndrapery in the eyes of the queen and court--Rather than fail of\r\ndistinction, he would sue for love to our gracious sovereign--the eyes\r\nof all men would be upon him in the course of three short days, and\r\nthe international peace of the two ends of the island endangered for a\r\ncreature, who, like a silly moth, cannot abstain from fluttering round a\r\nlight."\r\n\r\n"Thou hast prevailed with me, Father Eustace," said the Abbot, "and it\r\nwill go hard but I improve on thy plan--I will send up in secret, not\r\nonly household stuff, but wine and wassell-bread. There is a young\r\nswankie here who shoots venison well. I will give him directions to see\r\nthat the knight lacks none."\r\n\r\n"Whatever accommodation he can have, which infers not a risk of\r\ndiscovery," said the Sub-Prior, "it is our duty to afford him."\r\n\r\n"Nay," said the Abbot, "we will do more, and will instantly despatch a\r\nservant express to the keeper of our revestiary to send us such things\r\nas he may want, even this night. See it done, good father."\r\n\r\n"I will," answered Father Eustace; "but I hear the gull clamorous for\r\nsome one to truss his points.[Footnote: The points were the strings of\r\ncord or ribbon, (so called, because _pointed_ with metal like the laces\r\nof women\'s stays,) which attached the doublet to the hose. They were\r\nvery numerous, and required assistance to tie them properly, which was\r\ncalled _trussing_.] He will be fortunate if he lights on any one here\r\nwho can do him the office of groom of the chamber."\r\n\r\n"I would he would appear," said the Abbot, "for here comes the\r\nRefectioner with the collation--By my faith, the ride hath given me a\r\nsharp appetite!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter the Seventeenth.\r\n\r\n\r\n  I\'ll seek for other aid--Spirits, they say,\r\n  Flit round invisible, as thick as motes\r\n  Dance in the sunbeam. If that spell\r\n  Or necromancer\'s sigil can compel them,\r\n  They shall hold council with me.\r\n                JAMES DUFF.\r\n\r\nThe reader\'s attention must be recalled to Halbert Glendinning, who had\r\nleft the Tower of Glendearg immediately after his quarrel with its new\r\nguest, Sir Piercie Shafton. As he walked with a rapid pace up the glen,\r\nOld Martin followed him, beseeching him to be less hasty.\r\n\r\n"Halbert," said the old man, "you will never live to have white hair, if\r\nyou take fire thus at every spark of provocation."\r\n\r\n"And why should I wish it, old man," said Halbert, "if I am to be the\r\nbutt that every fool may aim a shaft of scorn against?--What avails it,\r\nold man, that you yourself move, sleep, and wake, eat thy niggard meal,\r\nand repose on thy hard pallet?--Why art thou so well pleased that the\r\nmorning should call thee up to daily toil, and the evening again lay\r\nthee down a wearied-out wretch? Were it not better sleep and wake no\r\nmore, than to undergo this dull exchange of labour for insensibility and\r\nof insensibility for labour?"\r\n\r\n"God help me," answered Martin, "there may be truth in what thou\r\nsayest--but walk slower, for my old limbs cannot keep pace with your\r\nyoung legs--walk slower, and I will tell you why age, though unlovely,\r\nis yet endurable."\r\n\r\n"Speak on then," said Halbert, slackening his pace, "but remember we\r\nmust seek venison to refresh the fatigues of these holy men, who will\r\nthis morning have achieved a journey of ten miles; and if we reach not\r\nthe Brocksburn head we are scarce like to see an antler."\r\n\r\n"Then know, my good Halbert," said Martin, "whom I love as my own son,\r\nthat I am satisfied to live till death calls me, because my Maker wills\r\nit. Ay, and although I spend what men call a hard life, pinched with\r\ncold in winter, and burnt with heat in summer, though I feed hard and\r\nsleep hard, and am held mean and despised, yet I bethink me, that were I\r\nof no use on the face of this fair creation, God would withdraw me from\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"Thou poor old man," said Halbert, "and can such a vain conceit as this\r\nof thy fancied use, reconcile thee to a world where thou playest so poor\r\na part?"\r\n\r\n"My part was nearly as poor," said Martin, "my person nearly as much\r\ndespised, the day that I saved my mistress and her child from perishing\r\nin the wilderness."\r\n\r\n"Right, Martin," answered Halbert; "there, indeed, thou didst what might\r\nbe a sufficient apology for a whole life of insignificance."\r\n\r\n"And do you account it for nothing, Halbert, that I should have\r\nthe power of giving you a lesson of patience, and submission to the\r\ndestinies of Providence? Methinks there is use for the grey hairs on\r\nthe old scalp, were it but to instruct the green head by precept and by\r\nexample."\r\n\r\nHalbert held down his face, and remained silent for a minute or two, and\r\nthen resumed his discourse: "Martin, seest thou aught changed in me of\r\nlate?"\r\n\r\n"Surely," said Martin. "I have always known you hasty, wild, and\r\ninconsiderate, rude, and prompt to speak at the volley and without\r\nreflection; but now, methinks, your bearing, without losing its natural\r\nfire, has something in it of force and dignity which it had not before.\r\nIt seems as if you had fallen asleep a carle, and awakened a gentleman."\r\n\r\n"Thou canst judge, then, of noble bearing?" said Halbert.\r\n\r\n"Surely," answered Martin, "in some sort I can; for I have travelled\r\nthrough court, and camp, and city, with my master, Walter Avenel,\r\nalthough he could do nothing for me in the long run, but give me room\r\nfor two score of sheep on the hill--and surely even now, while I speak\r\nwith you, I feel sensible that my language is more refined than it is my\r\nwont to use, and that--though I know not the reason--the rude northern\r\ndialect, so familiar to my tongue, has given place to a more town-bred\r\nspeech."\r\n\r\n"And this change in thyself and me, thou canst by no means account for?"\r\nsaid young Glendinning.\r\n\r\n"Change!" replied Martin, "by our Lady it is not so much a change which\r\nI feel, as a recalling and renewing sentiments and expressions which I\r\nhad some thirty years since, ere Tibb and I set up our humble household.\r\nIt is singular, that your society should have this sort of influence\r\nover me, Halbert, and that I should never have experienced it ere now."\r\n\r\n"Thinkest thou," said Halbert, "thou seest in me aught that can raise\r\nme from this base, low, despised state, into one where I may rank with\r\nthose proud men, who now despise my clownish poverty?"\r\n\r\nMartin paused an instant, and then answered, "Doubtless you may,\r\nHalbert; as broken a ship has come to land. Heard ye never of Hughie\r\nDun, who left this Halidome some thirty-five years gone by? A deliverly\r\nfellow was Hughie--could read and write like a priest, and could wield\r\nbrand and buckler with the best of the riders. I mind him--the like of\r\nhim was never seen in the Halidome of Saint Mary\'s, and so was seen of\r\nthe preferment that God sent him."\r\n\r\n"And what was that?" said Halbert, his eyes sparkling with eagerness.\r\n\r\n"Nothing less," answered Martin, "than body-servant to the Archbishop of\r\nSaint Andrews!"\r\n\r\nHalbert\'s countenance fell.--"A servant--and to a priest? Was this all\r\nthat knowledge and activity could raise him to?"\r\n\r\nMartin, in his turn, looked with wistful surprise in the face of his\r\nyoung friend. "And to what could fortune lead him farther?" answered\r\nhe. "The son of a kirk-feuar is not the stuff that lords and knights\r\nare made of. Courage and school craft cannot change churl\'s blood into\r\ngentle blood, I trow. I have heard, forby, that Hughie Dun left a good\r\nfive hundred punds of Scots money to his only daughter, and that she\r\nmarried the Bailie of Pittenweem."\r\n\r\nAt this moment, and while Halbert was embarrassed with devising a\r\nsuitable answer, a deer bounded across their path. In an instant the\r\ncrossbow was at the youth\'s shoulder, the bolt whistled, and the deer,\r\nafter giving one bound upright, dropt dead on the green sward.\r\n\r\n"There lies the venison our dame wanted," said Martin; "who would\r\nhave thought of an out-lying stag being so low down the glen at this\r\nseason?--And it is a hart of grease too, in full season, and three\r\ninches of fat on the brisket. Now this is all your luck, Halbert, that\r\nfollows you, go where you like. Were you to put in for it, I would\r\nwarrant you were made one of the Abbot\'s yeoman-prickers, and ride about\r\nin a purple doublet as bold as the best."\r\n\r\n"Tush, man," answered Halbert, "I will serve the Queen or no one. Take\r\nthou care to have down the venison to the Tower, since they expect it. I\r\nwill on to the moss. I have two or three bird-bolts at my girdle, and it\r\nmay be I shall find wild-fowl."\r\n\r\nHe hastened his pace, and was soon out of sight. Martin paused for a\r\nmoment, and looked after him. "There goes the making of a right gallant\r\nstripling, an ambition have not the spoiling of him--Serve the Queen!\r\nsaid he. By my faith, and she hath worse servants, from all that I e\'er\r\nheard of him. And wherefore should he not keep a high head? They that\r\nettle to the top of the ladder will at least get up some rounds. They\r\nthat mint [Footnote: _Mint_--aim at.] at a gown of gold, will always get\r\na sleeve of it. But come, sir, (addressing the stag,) you shall go to\r\nGlendearg on my two legs somewhat more slowly than you were frisking it\r\neven now on your own four nimble shanks. Nay, by my faith, if you be so\r\nheavy, I will content me with the best of you, and that\'s the haunch and\r\nthe nombles, and e\'en heave up the rest on the old oak-tree yonder, and\r\ncome back for it with one of the yauds." [Footnote: _Yauds_--horses;\r\nmore particularly horses of labour.]\r\n\r\nWhile Martin returned to Glendearg with the venison, Halbert prosecuted\r\nhis walk, breathing more easily since he was free of his companion. "The\r\ndomestic of a proud and lazy priest--body-squire to the Archbishop of\r\nSaint Andrews," he repeated to himself; "and this, with the privilege of\r\nallying his blood with the Bailie of Pittenween, is thought a preferment\r\nworth a brave man\'s struggling for;--nay more, a preferment which, if\r\nallowed, should crown the hopes, past, present, and to come, of the\r\nson of a Kirk-vassal! By Heaven, but that I find in me a reluctance to\r\npractise their acts of nocturnal rapine, I would rather take the jack\r\nand lance, and join with the Border-riders.--Something I will do. Here,\r\ndegraded and dishonoured, I will not live the scorn of each whiffling\r\nstranger from the South, because, forsooth, he wears tinkling spurs on a\r\ntawney boot. This thing--this phantom, be it what it will, I will see\r\nit once more. Since I spoke with her, and touched her hand, thoughts\r\nand feelings have dawned on me, of which my former life had not even\r\ndreamed; but shall I, who feel my father\'s glen too narrow for my\r\nexpanding spirit, brook to be bearded in it by this vain gewgaw of a\r\ncourtier, and in the sight too of Mary Avenel? I will not stoop to it,\r\nby Heaven!"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke thus, he arrived in the sequestered glen of Corri-nan-shian,\r\nas it verged upon the hour of noon. A few moments he remained looking\r\nupon the fountain, and doubting in his own mind with what countenance\r\nthe White Lady might receive him. She had not indeed expressly\r\nforbidden his again evoking her; but yet there was something like such\r\na prohibition implied in the farewell, which recommended him to wait for\r\nanother guide.\r\n\r\nHalbert Glendinning did not long, however, allow himself to pause.\r\nHardihood was the natural characteristic of his mind; and under the\r\nexpansion and modification which his feelings had lately undergone, it\r\nhad been augmented rather than diminished. He drew his sword, undid the\r\nbuskin from his foot, bowed three times with deliberation towards the\r\nfountain, and as often towards the tree, and repeated the same rhyme as\r\nformerly,--\r\n\r\n  "Thrice to the holy brake--\r\n    Thrice to the well:--\r\n  I bid thee awake,\r\n    White Maid of Avenel!\r\n\r\n  Noon gleams on the lake--\r\n    Noon glows on the fell--\r\n  Wake thee, O wake,\r\n    White Maid of Avenel!"\r\n\r\nHis eye was on the holly bush as he spoke the last line; and it was not\r\nwithout an involuntary shuddering that he saw the air betwixt his eye\r\nand that object become more dim, and condense, as it were, into\r\nthe faint appearance of a form, through which, however, so thin and\r\ntransparent was the first appearance of the phantom, he could discern\r\nthe outline of the bush, as through a veil of fine crape. But,\r\ngradually, it darkened into a more substantial appearance, and the White\r\nLady stood before him with displeasure on her brow. She spoke, and her\r\nspeech was still song, or rather measured chant; but, as if now more\r\nfamiliar, it flowed occasionally in modulated blank-verse, and at other\r\ntimes in the lyrical measure which she had used at their former meeting.\r\n\r\n  "This is the day when the fairy kind\r\n    Sits weeping alone for their hopeless lot,\r\n  And the wood-maiden sighs to the sighing wind,\r\n    And the mer-maiden weeps in her crystal grot:\r\n  For this is the day that a deed was wrought,\r\n    In which we have neither part nor share.\r\n  For the children of clay was salvation bought,\r\n    But not for the forms of sea or air!\r\n  And ever the mortal is most forlorn.\r\n    Who meeteth our race on the Friday morn."\r\n\r\n"Spirit," said Halbert Glendinning, boldly, "it is bootless to threaten.\r\none who holds his life at no rate. Thine anger can but slay; nor do I\r\nthink thy power extendeth, or thy will stretcheth, so far. The terrors\r\nwhich your race produce upon others, are vain against me. My heart is\r\nhardened against fear, as by a sense of despair. If I am, as thy words\r\ninfer, of a race more peculiarly the care of Heaven than thine, it is\r\nmine to call, it must be thine to answer. I am the nobler being."\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, the figure looked upon him with a fierce and ireful\r\ncountenance, which, without losing the similitude of that which it\r\nusually exhibited, had a wilder and more exaggerated cast of features.\r\nThe eyes seemed to contract and become more fiery, and slight\r\nconvulsions passed over the face, as if it was about to be transformed\r\ninto something hideous. The whole appearance resembled those faces which\r\nthe imagination summons up when it is disturbed by laudanum, but which\r\ndo not remain under the visionary\'s command, and, beautiful in their\r\nfirst appearance, become wild and grotesque ere we can arrest them.\r\n\r\nBut when Halbert had concluded his bold speech, the White Lady stood\r\nbefore him with the same pale, fixed, and melancholy aspect, which she\r\nusually bore. He had expected the agitation which she exhibited would\r\nconclude in some frightful metamorphosis. Folding her arms on her bosom,\r\nthe phantom replied,--\r\n\r\n  "Daring youth! for thee it is well,\r\n  Here calling me in haunted dell,\r\n  That thy heart has not quail\'d,\r\n       Nor thy courage fail\'d,\r\n       And that thou couldst brook\r\n  The angry look\r\n       Of Her of Avenel.\r\n\r\n  Did one limb shiver,\r\n       Or an eyelid quiver,\r\n  Thou wert lost for ever.\r\n  Though I am form\'d from the ether blue,\r\n  And my blood is of the unfallen dew.\r\n       And thou art framed of mud and dust,\r\n  \'Tis thine to speak, reply I must."\r\n\r\n"I demand of thee, then," said the youth, "by what charm it is that I\r\nam thus altered in mind and in wishes--that I think no longer of deer\r\nor dog, of bow or bolt--that my soul spurns the bounds of this obscure\r\nglen--that my blood boils at an insult from one by whose stirrup I\r\nwould some days since have run for a whole summer\'s morn, contented and\r\nhonoured by the notice of a single word? Why do I now seek to mate\r\nme with princes, and knights, and nobles?--Am I the same, who but\r\nyesterday, as it were, slumbered in contented obscurity, but who am\r\nto-day awakened to glory and ambition?--Speak--tell me, if thou canst,\r\nthe meaning of this change?--Am I spell-bound?--or have I till now been\r\nunder the influence of a spell, that I feel as another being, yet\r\nam conscious of remaining the same? Speak and tell me, is it to thy\r\ninfluence that the change is owing?"\r\n\r\nThe White Lady replied,--\r\n\r\n  "A mightier wizard far than I\r\n    Wields o\'er the universe his power;\r\n  Him owns the eagle in the sky,\r\n    The turtle in the bower.\r\n  Chanceful in shape, yet mightiest still,\r\n  He wields the heart of man at will,\r\n  From ill to good, from good, to ill,\r\n  In cot and castle-tower."\r\n\r\n"Speak not thus darkly," said the youth, colouring so deeply, that\r\nface, neck, and hands were in a sanguine glow; "make me sensible of thy\r\npurpose."\r\n\r\nThe spirit answered,--\r\n\r\n  "Ask thy heart,--whose secret cell\r\n  Is fill\'d with Marv Avenel!\r\n  Ask thy pride,--why scornful look\r\n  In Mary\'s view it will not brook?\r\n  Ask it, why thou seek\'st to rise\r\n  Among the mighty and the wise?--\r\n  Why thou spurn\'st thy lowly lot?--\r\n  Why thy pastimes are forgot?\r\n  Why thou wouldst in bloody strife\r\n  Mend thy luck or lose thy life?\r\n  Ask thy heart, and it shall tell,\r\n  Sighing from its secret cell,\r\n  \'Tis for Mary Avenel."\r\n\r\n"Tell me, then," said Halbert, his cheek still deeply crimsoned, "thou\r\nwho hast said to me that which I dared not say to myself, by what means\r\nshall I urge my passion--by what means make it known?"\r\n\r\nThe White Lady replied,--\r\n\r\n  "Do not ask me;\r\n  On doubts like these thou canst not task me.\r\n  We only see the passing show\r\n  Of human passions\' ebb and flow;\r\n  And view the pageant\'s idle glance\r\n  As mortals eye the northern dance,\r\n  When thousand streamers, flashing bright,\r\n  Career it o\'er the brow of night.\r\n  And gazers mark their changeful gleams,\r\n  But feel no influence from their beams."\r\n\r\n"Yet thine own fate," replied Halbert, "unless men greatly err, is\r\nlinked with that of mortals?"\r\n\r\nThe phantom answered,\r\n\r\n  "By ties mysterious link\'d, our fated race\r\n  Holds strange connexion with the sons of men.\r\n  The star that rose upon the House of Avenel,\r\n  When Norman Ulric first assumed the name,\r\n  That star, when culminating in its orbit,\r\n  Shot from its sphere a drop of diamond dew,\r\n  And this bright font received it--and a Spirit\r\n  Rose from the fountain, and her date of life\r\n  Hath co-existence with the House of Avenel,\r\n  And with the star that rules it."\r\n\r\n"Speak yet more plainly," answered young Glendinning; "of this I\r\ncan understand nothing. Say, what hath forged thy wierded [Footnote:\r\n_Wierded_--fated.] link of destiny with the House of Avenel? Say,\r\nespecially, what fate now overhangs that house?"\r\n\r\nThe White Lady replied,--\r\n\r\n  "Look on my girdle--on this thread of gold--\r\n  \'Tis fine as web of lightest gossamer.\r\n  And, but there is a spell on\'t, would not bind,\r\n  Light as they are, the folds of my thin robe.\r\n  But when \'twas donn\'d, it was a massive chain,\r\n  Such as might bind the champion of the Jews,\r\n\r\n  Even when his looks were longest--it hath dwindled,\r\n  Hath minish\'d in its substance and its strength,\r\n  As sunk the greatness of the House of Avenel.\r\n  When this frail thread gives way. I to the elements\r\n  Resign the principles of life they lent me.\r\n  Ask me no more of this!--the stars forbid it."\r\n\r\n"Then canst thou read the stars," answered the youth; "and mayest tell\r\nme the fate of my passion, if thou canst not aid it?"\r\n\r\nThe White Lady again replied,--\r\n\r\n  "Dim burns the once bright star of Avenel,\r\n  Dim as the beacon when the morn is nigh,\r\n  And the o\'er-wearied warder leaves the light-house;\r\n  There is an influence sorrowful and fearful.\r\n  That dogs its downward course. Disastrous passion,\r\n  Fierce hate and rivalry, are in the aspect\r\n  That lowers upon its fortunes."\r\n\r\n"And rivalry?" repeated Glendinning; "it is, then, as I feared!--But\r\nshall that English silkworm presume to beard me in my father\'s house,\r\nand in the presence of Mary Avenel?--Give me to meet him, spirit--give\r\nme to do away the vain distinction of rank on which he refuses me the\r\ncombat. Place us on equal terms, and gleam the stars with what aspect\r\nthey will, the sword of my father shall control their influences."\r\n\r\nShe answered as promptly as before,--\r\n\r\n  "Complain not of me, child of clay,\r\n  If to thy harm I yield the way.\r\n  We, who soar thy sphere above,\r\n  Know not aught of hate or love;\r\n  As will or wisdom rules thy mood,\r\n  My gifts to evil turn, or good."\r\n\r\n"Give me to redeem my honour," said Halbert Glendinning--"give me to\r\nretort on my proud rival the insults he has thrown on me, and let the\r\nrest fare as it will. If I cannot revenge my wrong, I shall sleep quiet,\r\nand know nought of my disgrace."\r\n\r\nThe phantom failed not to reply,--\r\n\r\n  "When Piercie Shafton boasteth high,\r\n  Let this token meet his eye.\r\n  The sun is westering from the dell,\r\n  Thy wish is granted--fare thee well!"\r\n\r\nAs the White Lady spoke or chanted these last words, she undid from her\r\nlocks a silver bodkin around which they were twisted, and gave it to\r\nHalbert Glendinning; then shaking her dishevelled hair till it fell like\r\na veil around her, the outlines of her form gradually became as diffuse\r\nas her flowing tresses, her countenance grew pale as the moon in her\r\nfirst quarter, her features became indistinguishable, and she melted\r\ninto the air.\r\n\r\nHabit inures us to wonders; but the youth did not find himself alone\r\nby the fountain without experiencing, though in a much less degree,\r\nthe revulsion of spirits which he had felt upon the phantom\'s former\r\ndisappearance. A doubt strongly pressed upon his mind, whether it\r\nwere safe to avail himself of the gifts of a spirit which did not even\r\npretend to belong to the class of angels, and might, for aught he knew,\r\nhave a much worse lineage than that which she was pleased to avow. "I\r\nwill speak of it," he said, "to Edward, who is clerkly learned, and will\r\ntell me what I should do. And yet, no--Edward is scrupulous and wary.--I\r\nwill prove the effect of her gift on Sir Piercie Shafton, if he again\r\nbraves me, and by the issue, I will be myself a sufficient judge whether\r\nthere is danger in resorting to her counsel. Home, then, home--and we\r\nshall soon learn whether that home shall longer hold me; for not again\r\nwill I brook insult, with my father\'s sword by my side, and Mary for the\r\nspectator of my disgrace."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter the Eighteenth.\r\n\r\n\r\n  I give thee eighteenpence a-day,\r\n    And my bow shall thou bear,\r\n  And over all the north country,\r\n    I make thee the chief rydere.\r\n  And I thirteenpence a-day, quoth the queen,\r\n    By God and by my faye,\r\n  Come fetch thy payment when thou wilt,\r\n    No man shall say thee nay.\r\n              WILLIAM OF CLOUDESLEY.\r\n\r\nThe manners of the age did not permit the inhabitants of Glendearg to\r\npartake of the collation which was placed in the spence of that ancient\r\ntower, before the Lord Abbot and his attendants, and Sir Piercie\r\nShafton. Dame Glendinning was excluded, both by inferiority of rank and\r\nby sex, for (though it was a rule often neglected) the Superior of Saint\r\nMary\'s was debarred from taking his meals in female society. To Mary\r\nAvenel the latter, and to Edward Glendinning the former, incapacity\r\nattached; but it pleased his lordship to require their presence in\r\nthe apartment, and to say sundry kind words to them upon the ready and\r\nhospitable reception which they had afforded him.\r\n\r\nThe smoking haunch now stood upon the table; a napkin, white as snow,\r\nwas, with due reverence, tucked under the chin of the Abbot by the\r\nRefectioner; and nought was wanting to commence the repast, save the\r\npresence of Sir Piercie Shafton, who at length appeared, glittering\r\nlike the sun, in a carnation-velvet doublet, slashed and puffed out with\r\ncloth of silver, his hat of the newest block, surrounded by a hatband\r\nof goldsmith\'s work, while around his neck he wore a collar of gold, set\r\nwith rubies and topazes so rich, that it vindicated his anxiety for the\r\nsafety of his baggage from being founded upon his love of mere finery.\r\nThis gorgeous collar or chain, resembling those worn by the knights of\r\nthe highest orders of chivalry, fell down on his breast, and terminated\r\nin a medallion.\r\n\r\n"We waited for Sir Piercie Shafton," said the Abbot, hastily assuming\r\nhis place in the great chair which the Kitchener advanced to the table\r\nwith ready hand.\r\n\r\n"I pray your pardon, reverend father, and my good lord," replied that\r\npink of courtesy; "I did but wait to cast my riding slough, and\r\nto transmew myself into some civil form meeter for this worshipful\r\ncompany."\r\n\r\n"I cannot but praise your gallantry, Sir Knight," said the Abbot,\r\n"and your prudence, also, for choosing the fitting time to appear thus\r\nadorned. Certes, had that goodly chain been visible in some part of your\r\nlate progress, there was risk that the lawful owner might have parted\r\ncompany therewith."\r\n\r\n"This chain, said your reverence?" answered Sir Piercie; "surely it is\r\nbut a toy, a trifle, a slight thing which shows but poorly with this\r\ndoublet--marry, when I wear that of the murrey-coloured double-piled\r\nGenoa velvet, puffed out with ciprus, the gems, being relieved and set\r\noff by the darker and more grave ground of the stuff, show like stars\r\ngiving a lustre through dark clouds."\r\n\r\n"I nothing doubt it," said the Abbot, "but I pray you to sit down at the\r\nboard."\r\n\r\nBut Sir Piercie had now got into his element, and was not easily\r\ninterrupted--"I own," he continued, "that slight as the toy is, it might\r\nperchance have had some captivation for Julian--Santa Maria!" said\r\nhe, interrupting himself; "what was I about to say, and my fair and\r\nbeauteous Protection, or shall I rather term her my Discretion, here\r\nin presence!--Indiscreet hath it been in your Affability, O most lovely\r\nDiscretion, to suffer a stray word to have broke out of the penfold of\r\nhis mouth, that might overleap the fence of civility, and trespass on\r\nthe manor of decorum."\r\n\r\n"Marry!" said the Abbot, somewhat impatiently, "the greatest discretion\r\nthat I can see in the matter is, to eat our victuals being hot--Father\r\nEustace, say the Benedicite, and cut up the haunch."\r\n\r\nThe Sub-Prior readily obeyed the first part of the Abbot\'s injunction,\r\nbut paused upon the second--"It is Friday, most reverend," he said in\r\nLatin, desirous that the hint should escape, if possible, the ears of\r\nthe stranger.\r\n\r\n"We are travellers," said the Abbot, in reply, "and _viatoribus licitum\r\nest_--You know the canon--a traveller must eat what food his hard fate\r\nsets before him. I grant you all a dispensation to eat flesh this day,\r\nconditionally that you, brethren, say the Confiteor at curfew time, that\r\nthe knight give alms to his ability, and that all and each of you\r\nfast from flesh on such day within the next month that shall seem\r\nmost convenient;--wherefore fall to and eat your food with cheerful\r\ncountenances, and you, Father Refectioner, _da mixtus_."\r\n\r\nWhile the Abbot was thus stating the conditions on which his indulgence\r\nwas granted, he had already half finished a slice of the noble haunch,\r\nand now washed it down with a flagon of Rhenish, modestly tempered with\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n"Well is it said," he observed, as he required from the Refectioner\r\nanother slice, "that virtue is its own reward; for though this is but\r\nhumble fare, and hastily prepared, and eaten in a poor chamber, I do not\r\nremember me of having had such an appetite since I was a simple brother\r\nin the Abbey of Dundrennan, and was wont to labour in the garden from\r\nmorning until nones, when our Abbot struck the _Cymbalum_. Then would I\r\nenter keen with hunger, parched with thirst, (_da mihi vinum quaeso, et\r\nmerum sit_,) and partake with appetite of whatever was set before us,\r\naccording to our rule; feast or fast day, _caritas_ or _penitentia_, was\r\nthe same to me. I had no stomach complaints then, which now crave both\r\nthe aid of wine and choice cookery, to render my food acceptable to my\r\npalate, and easy of digestion."\r\n\r\n"It may be, holy father," said the Sub-Prior, "an occasional ride to the\r\nextremity of Saint Mary\'s patrimony, may have the same happy effect on\r\nyour health as the air of the garden at Dundrennan."\r\n\r\n"Perchance, with our patroness\'s blessing, such progresses may advantage\r\nus," said the Abbot; "having an especial eye that our venison is\r\ncarefully killed by some woodsman that is master of his craft."\r\n\r\n"If the Lord Abbot will permit me," said the Kitchener, "I think the\r\nbest way to assure his lordship on that important point, would be to\r\nretain as a yeoman-pricker, or deputy-ranger, the eldest son of this\r\ngood woman, Dame Glendinning, who is here to wait upon us. I should\r\nknow by mine office what belongs to killing of game, and I can safely\r\npronounce, that never saw I, or any other _coquinarius_, a bolt so\r\njustly shot. It has cloven the very heart of the buck."\r\n\r\n"What speak you to us of one good shot, father?" said Sir Piercie;\r\n"I would advise you that such no more maketh a shooter, than doth one\r\nswallow make a summer--I have seen this springald of whom you speak, and\r\nif his hand can send forth his shafts as boldly as his tongue doth utter\r\npresumptuous speeches, I will own him as good an archer as Robin Hood."\r\n\r\n"Marry," said the Abbot, "and it is fitting we know the truth of this\r\nmatter from the dame herself; for ill advised were we to give way to\r\nany rashness in this matter, whereby the bounties which Heaven and our\r\npatroness provide might be unskilfully mangled, and rendered unfit for\r\nworthy men\'s use.--Stand forth, therefore, dame Glendinning, and tell to\r\nus, as thy liege lord and spiritual Superior, using plainness and truth,\r\nwithout either fear or favour, as being a matter wherein we are deeply\r\ninterested, Doth this son of thine use his bow as well as the Father\r\nKitchener avers to us?"\r\n\r\n"So please your noble fatherhood," answered Dame Glendinning with a\r\ndeep curtsy, "I should know somewhat of archery to my cost, seeing my\r\nhusband--God assoilzie him!--was slain in the field of Pinkie with an\r\narrow-shot, while he was fighting under the Kirk\'s banner, as became\r\na liege vassal of the Halidome. He was a valiant man, please your\r\nreverence, and an honest; and saving that he loved a bit of venison, and\r\nshifted for his living at a time as Border-men will sometimes do, I wot\r\nnot of sin that he did. And yet, though I have paid for mass after mass\r\nto the matter of a forty shilling, besides a quarter of wheat and four\r\nfirlocks of rye, I can have no assurance yet that he has been delivered\r\nfrom purgatory."\r\n\r\n"Dame," said the Lord Abbot, "this shall be looked into heedfully; and\r\nsince thy husband fell, as thou sayest, in the Kirk\'s quarrel, and\r\nunder her banner, rely upon it that we will have him out of purgatory\r\nforthwith--that is, always provided he be there.--But it is not of\r\nthy husband whom we now devise to speak, but of thy son; not of a shot\r\nScotsman, but of a shot deer--Wherefore, I say, answer me to the point,\r\nis thy son a practised archer, ay or no?"\r\n\r\n"Alack! my reverend lord," replied the widow, "and my croft would\r\nbe better tilled, if I could answer your reverence that he is\r\nnot.--Practised archer!--marry, holy sir, I would he would practise\r\nsomething else--cross-bow and long-bow, hand-gun and hack-but, falconet\r\nand saker, he can shoot with them all. And if it would please this right\r\nhonourable gentleman, our guest, to hold out his hat at the distance of\r\na hundred yards, our Halbert shall send shaft, bolt, or bullet through\r\nit, (so that right honourable gentleman swerve not, but hold out\r\nsteady,) and I will forfeit a quarter of barley if he touch but a knot\r\nof his ribands. I have seen our old Martin do as much, and so has our\r\nright reverend the Sub-Prior, if he be pleased to remember it."\r\n\r\n"I am not like to forget it, dame," said Father Eustace; "for I knew\r\nnot which most to admire, the composure of the young marksman, or the\r\nsteadiness of the old mark. Yet I presume not to advise Sir Piercie\r\nShafton to subject his valuable beaver, and yet more valuable person, to\r\nsuch a risk, unless it should be his own special pleasure."\r\n\r\n"Be assured it is not," said Sir Piercie Shafton, something hastily;\r\n"be well assured, holy father, that it is not. I dispute not the lad\'s\r\nqualities, for which your reverence vouches. But bows are but wood,\r\nstrings are but flax, or the silk-worm excrement at best; archers are\r\nbut men, fingers may slip, eyes may dazzle, the blindest may hit the\r\nbutt, the best marker may shoot a bow\'s length beside. Therefore will we\r\ntry no perilous experiments."\r\n\r\n"Be that as you will, Sir Piercie," said the Abbot; "meantime we will\r\nname this youth bow-bearer in the forest granted to us by good King\r\nDavid, that the chase might recreate our wearied spirits, the flesh of\r\nthe dear improve our poor commons, and the hides cover the books of our\r\nlibrary; thus tending at once to the sustenance of body and soul."\r\n\r\n"Kneel down, woman, kneel down," said the Refectioner and the Kitchener,\r\nwith one voice, to Dame Glendinning, "and kiss his lordship\'s hand, for\r\nthe grace which he has granted to thy son."\r\n\r\nThey then, as if they had been chanting the service and the responses,\r\nset off in a sort of duetto, enumerating the advantages of the\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n"A green gown and a pair of leathern galligaskins every Pentecost," said\r\nthe Kitchener.\r\n\r\n"Four marks by the year at Candlemas," answered the Refectioner.\r\n\r\n"A hogshead of ale at Martlemas, of the double strike, and single ale at\r\npleasure, as he shall agree with the Cellarer--"\r\n\r\n"Who is a reasonable man," said the Abbot, "and will encourage an active\r\nservant of the convent."\r\n\r\n"A mess of broth and a dole of mutton or beef, at the Kitchener\'s, on\r\neach high holiday," resumed the Kitchener.\r\n\r\n"The gang of two cows and a palfrey on our Lady\'s meadow." answered his\r\nbrother officer.\r\n\r\n"An ox-hide to make buskins of yearly, because of the brambles," echoed\r\nthe Kitchener.\r\n\r\n"And various other perquisites, _quae nunc praescribere longum_," said\r\nthe Abbot, summing, with his own lordly voice, the advantages attached\r\nto the office of conventional bow-bearer.\r\n\r\nDame Glendinning was all this while on her knees, her head mechanically\r\nturning from the one church officer to the other, which, as they stood\r\none on each side of her, had much the appearance of a figure moved by\r\nclock-work, and so soon as they were silent, most devotedly did she\r\nkiss the munificent hand of the Abbot. Conscious, however, of Halbert\'s\r\nintractability in some points, she could not help qualifying her\r\ngrateful and reiterated thanks for the Abbot\'s bountiful proffer, with a\r\nhope that Halbert would see his wisdom, and accept of it.\r\n\r\n"How," said the Abbot, bending his brows, "accept of it?--Woman, is thy\r\nson in his right wits?"\r\n\r\nElspeth, stunned by the tone in which this question was asked, was\r\naltogether unable to reply to it. Indeed, any answer she might have made\r\ncould hardly have been heard, as it pleased the two office-bearers of\r\nthe Abbot\'s table again to recommence their alternate dialogue.\r\n\r\n"Refuse!" said the Kitchener.\r\n\r\n"Refuse!" answered the Refectioner, echoing the other\'s word in a tone\r\nof still louder astonishment.\r\n\r\n"Refuse four marks by the year!" said the one.\r\n\r\n"Ale and beer--broth and mutton--cow\'s grass and palfrey\'s!" shouted the\r\nKitchener.\r\n\r\n"Gown and galligaskins!" responded the Refectioner.\r\n\r\n"A moment\'s patience, my brethren," answered the Sub-Prior, "and let us\r\nnot be thus astonished before cause is afforded of our amazement. This\r\ngood dame best knoweth the temper and spirit of her son--this much I can\r\nsay, that it lieth not towards letters or learning, of which I have in\r\nvain endeavoured to instil into him some tincture. Nevertheless, he is\r\na youth of no common spirit, but much like those (in my weak judgment)\r\nwhom God raises up among a people when he meaneth that their deliverance\r\nshall be wrought out with strength of hand and valour of heart. Such\r\nmen we have seen marked with a waywardness, and even an obstinacy of\r\ncharacter, which hath appeared intractability and stupidity to those\r\namong whom they walked and were conversant, until the very opportunity\r\nhath arrived in, which it was the will of Providence that they should be\r\nthe fitting instrument of great things."\r\n\r\n"Now, in good time hast thou spoken, Father Eustace," said the Abbot;\r\n"and we will see this swankie before we decide upon the means of\r\nemploying him.--How say you, Sir Piercie Shafton, is it not the court\r\nfashion to suit the man to the office, and not the office to the man?"\r\n\r\n"So please your reverence and lordship," answered the Northumbrian\r\nknight, "I do partly, that is, in some sort, subscribe to what your\r\nwisdom hath delivered--Nevertheless, under reverence of the Sub-Prior,\r\nwe do not look for gallant leaders and national deliverers in the hovels\r\nof the mean common people. Credit me, that if there be some flashes of\r\nmartial spirit about this young person, which I am not called upon to\r\ndispute, (though I have seldom seen that presumption and arrogance were\r\nmade good upon the upshot by deed and action,) yet still these will\r\nprove insufficient to distinguish him, save in his own limited and lowly\r\nsphere--even as the glowworm, which makes a goodly show among the grass\r\nof the field, would be of little avail if deposited in a beacon-grate."\r\n\r\n"Now, in good time," said the Sub-Prior, "and here comes the young\r\nhuntsman to speak for himself;" for, being placed opposite to the\r\nwindow, he could observe Halbert as he ascended the little mound on\r\nwhich the tower was situated.\r\n\r\n"Summon him to our presence," said the Lord Abbot; and with an obedient\r\nstart the two attendant monks went off with emulous alertness. Dame\r\nGlendinning sprung away at the same moment, partly to gain an instant to\r\nrecommend obedience to her son, partly to prevail with him to change his\r\napparel before coming in presence of the Abbot. But the Kitchener and\r\nRefectioner, both speaking at once, had already seized each an arm, and\r\nwere leading Halbert in triumph into the apartment, so that she could\r\nonly ejaculate, "His will be done; but an he had but had on him his\r\nSunday\'s hose!"\r\n\r\nLimited and humble as this desire was, the fates did not grant it, for\r\nHalbert Glendinning was hurried into the presence of the Lord Abbot and\r\nhis party, without a word of explanation, and without a moment\'s time\r\nbeing allowed to assume his holiday hose, which, in the language of the\r\ntime, implied both breeches and stockings.\r\n\r\nYet, though thus suddenly presented amid the centre of all eyes, there\r\nwas something in Halbert\'s appearance which commanded a certain degree\r\nof respect from the company into which he was so unceremoniously\r\nintruded, and the greater part of whom were disposed to consider him\r\nwith hauteur if not with absolute contempt. But his appearance and\r\nreception we must devote to another chapter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter the Nineteenth.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Now choose thee, gallant, betwixt wealth and honour;\r\n  There lies the pelf, in sum to bear thee through\r\n  The dance of youth, and the turmoil of manhood,\r\n  Yet leave enough for age\'s chimney-corner;\r\n  But an thou grasp to it, farewell ambition,\r\n  Farewell each hope of bettering thy condition,\r\n  And raising thy low rank above the churls\r\n  That till the earth for bread.\r\n                                 OLD PLAY.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to dwell for some brief space on the appearance and\r\ndemeanour of young Glendinning, ere we proceed to describe his interview\r\nwith the Abbot of St. Mary\'s, at this momentous crisis of his life.\r\n\r\nHalbert was now about nineteen years old, tall and active rather than\r\nstrong, yet of that hardy conformation of limb and sinew, which promises\r\ngreat strength when the growth shall be complete, and the system\r\nconfirmed. He was perfectly well made, and, like most men who have that\r\nadvantage, possessed a grace and natural ease of manner and carriage,\r\nwhich prevented his height from being the distinguished part of his\r\nexternal appearance. It was not until you had compared his stature with\r\nthat of those amongst or near to whom he stood, that you became\r\nsensible that the young Glendinning was upwards of six feet high. In the\r\ncombination of unusual height with perfect symmetry, ease, and grace of\r\ncarriage, the young heir of Glendearg, notwithstanding his rustic birth\r\nand education, had greatly the advantage even of Sir Piercie Shafton\r\nhimself, whose stature was lower, and his limbs, though there was\r\nno particular point to object to, were on the whole less exactly\r\nproportioned. On the other hand, Sir Piercie\'s very handsome countenance\r\nafforded him as decided an advantage over the Scotsman, as regularity of\r\nfeatures and brilliance of complexion could give over traits which were\r\nrather strongly marked than beautiful, and upon whose complexion the\r\n"skyey influences," to which he was constantly exposed, had blended\r\nthe red and white into the purely nut-brown hue, which coloured alike\r\ncheeks, neck, and forehead, and blushed only in a darker glow upon the\r\nformer.--Halbert\'s eyes supplied a marked and distinguished part of\r\nhis physiognomy. They were large and of a hazel colour, and sparkled in\r\nmoments of animation with such uncommon brilliancy, that it seemed as\r\nif they actually emitted light. Nature had closely curled the locks of\r\ndark-brown hair, which relieved and set off the features, such as we\r\nhave described them, displaying a bold and animated disposition, much\r\nmore than might have been expected from his situation, or from his\r\nprevious manners, which hitherto had seemed bashful, homely, and\r\nawkward.\r\n\r\nHalbert\'s dress was certainly not of that description which sets off to\r\nthe best advantage a presence of itself prepossessing. His jerkin and\r\nhose were of coarse rustic cloth, and his cap of the same. A belt\r\nround his waist served at once to sustain the broad-sword which we have\r\nalready mentioned, and to hold five or six arrows and bird-bolts, which\r\nwere stuck into it on the right side, along with a large knife hilted\r\nwith buck-horn, or, as it was then called, a dudgeon-dagger. To complete\r\nhis dress, we must notice his loose buskins of deer\'s hide, formed so as\r\nto draw up on the leg as high as the knee, or at pleasure to be thrust\r\ndown lower than the calves. These were generally used at the period by\r\nsuch as either had their principal occupation, or their chief pleasure,\r\nin silvan sports, as they served to protect the legs against the rough\r\nand tangled thickets into which the pursuit of game frequently led\r\nthem.--And these trifling particulars complete his external appearance.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to do justice to the manner in which young Glendinning\'s\r\nsoul spoke through his eyes when ushered so suddenly into the company of\r\nthose whom his earliest education had taught him to treat with awe and\r\nreverence. The degree of embarrassment, which his demeanor evinced, had\r\nnothing in it either meanly servile, or utterly disconcerted. It was no\r\nmore than became a generous and ingenuous youth of a bold spirit, but\r\ntotally inexperienced, who should for the first time be called upon to\r\nthink and act for himself in such society and under such disadvantageous\r\ncircumstances. There was not in his carriage a grain either of\r\nforwardness or of timidity, which a friend could have wished away.\r\n\r\nHe kneeled and kissed the Abbot\'s hand, then rose, and retiring two\r\npaces, bowed respectfully to the circle around, smiling gently as he\r\nreceived an encouraging nod from the Sub-Prior, to whom alone he was\r\npersonally known, and blushing as he encountered the anxious look of\r\nMary Avenel, who beheld with painful interest the sort of ordeal to\r\nwhich her foster-brother was about to be subjected. Recovering from the\r\ntransient flurry of spirits into which the encounter of her glance had\r\nthrown him, he stood composedly awaiting till the Abbot should express\r\nhis pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe ingenuous expression of countenance, noble form, and graceful\r\nattitude of the young man, failed not to prepossess in his favor the\r\nchurchmen in whose presence he stood. The Abbot looked round, and\r\nexchanged a gracious and approving glance with his counsellor Father\r\nEustace, although probably the appointment of a ranger, or bow-bearer,\r\nwas one in which he might have been disposed to proceed without the\r\nSub-Prior\'s advice, were it but to show his own free agency. But the\r\ngood mien of the young man now in nomination was such, that he rather\r\nhastened to exchange congratulation on meeting with so proper a subject\r\nof promotion, than to indulge any other feeling. Father Eustace enjoyed\r\nthe pleasure which a well-constituted mind derives from seeing a benefit\r\nlight on a deserving object; for as he had not seen Halbert since\r\ncircumstances had made so material a change in his manner and feelings,\r\nhe scarce doubted that the proffered appointment would, notwithstanding\r\nhis mother\'s uncertainty, suit the disposition of a youth who had\r\nappeared devoted to woodland sports, and a foe alike to sedentary or\r\nsettled occupation of any kind. The Refectioner and Kitchener were so\r\nwell pleased with Halbert\'s prepossessing appearance, that they seemed\r\nto think that the salary, emoluments, and perquisites, the dole, the\r\ngrazing, the gown, and the galligaskins, could scarce be better bestowed\r\nthan on the active and graceful figure before them.\r\n\r\nSir Piercie Shafton, whether from being more deeply engaged in his own\r\ncogitations, or that the subject was unworthy of his notice, did not\r\nseem to partake of the general feeling of approbation excited by the\r\nyoung man\'s presence. He sate with his eyes half shut, and his arms\r\nfolded, appearing to be wrapped in contemplations of a nature deeper\r\nthan those arising out of the scene before him. But, notwithstanding his\r\nseeming abstraction and absence of mind, there was a flutter of vanity\r\nin Sir Piercie\'s very handsome countenance, an occasional change of\r\nposture from one striking attitude (or what he conceived to be such)\r\nto another, and an occasional stolen glance at the female part of the\r\ncompany, to spy how far he succeeded in riveting their attention, which\r\ngave a marked advantage, in comparison, to the less regular and more\r\nharsh features of Halbert Glendinning, with their composed, manly, and\r\ndeliberate expression of mental fortitude.\r\n\r\nOf the females belonging to the family of Glendearg, the Miller\'s\r\ndaughter alone had her mind sufficiently at leisure to admire, from time\r\nto time, the graceful attitudes of Sir Piercie Shafton; for both Mary\r\nAvenel and Dame Glendinning were waiting in anxiety and apprehension\r\nthe answer which Halbert was to return to the Abbot\'s proposal, and\r\nfearfully anticipating the consequences of his probable refusal.\r\nThe conduct of his brother Edward, for a lad constitutionally shy,\r\nrespectful, and even timid, was at once affectionate and noble. This\r\nyounger son of Dame Elspeth had stood unnoticed in a corner, after\r\nthe Abbot, at the request of the Sub-Prior, had honoured him with some\r\npassing notice, and asked him a few common-place questions about his\r\nprogress in Donatus, and in the _Promptuarium Parvulorum_, without\r\nwaiting for the answers. From his corner he now glided round to his\r\nbrother\'s side, and keeping a little behind him, slid his right hand\r\ninto the huntsman\'s left, and by a gentle pressure, which Halbert\r\ninstantly and ardently returned, expressed at once his interest in his\r\nsituation, and his resolution to share his fate.\r\n\r\nThe group was thus arranged, when, after the pause of two or three\r\nminutes, which he employed in slowly sipping his cup of wine, in order\r\nthat he might enter on his proposal with due and deliberate dignity, the\r\nAbbot at length expressed himself thus:--\r\n\r\n"My son--we your lawful Superior, and the Abbot, under God\'s favour,\r\nof the community of Saint Mary\'s, have heard of your manifold good\r\ngifts--a-hem--especially touching wood-craft--and the huntsman-like\r\nfashion in which you strike your game, truly and as a yeoman should, not\r\nabusing Heaven\'s good benefits by spoiling the flesh, as is too often\r\nseen in careless rangers--a-hem." He made here a pause, but observing\r\nthat Glendinning only replied to his compliment by a bow, he\r\nproceeded,--"My son, we commend your modesty; nevertheless, we will\r\nthat thou shouldst speak freely to us touching that which we have\r\npremeditated for thine advancement, meaning to confer on thee the office\r\nof bow-bearer and ranger, as well over the chases and forests wherein\r\nour house hath privilege by the gifts of pious kings and nobles, whose\r\nsouls now enjoy the fruits of their bounties to the Church as to those\r\nwhich belong to us in exclusive right of property and perpetuity. Thy\r\nknee, my son--that we may, with our own hand, and without loss of time,\r\ninduct thee into office."\r\n\r\n"Kneel down," said the Kitchener on the one side; and "Kneel down," said\r\nthe Refectioner on the other.\r\n\r\nBut Halbert Glendinning remained standing.\r\n\r\n"Were it to show gratitude and good-will for your reverend lordship\'s\r\nnoble offer, I could not," he said, "kneel low enough, or remain long\r\nenough kneeling. But I may not kneel to take investure of your\r\nnoble gift, my Lord Abbot, being a man determined to seek my fortune\r\notherwise."\r\n\r\n"How is that, sir?" said the Abbot, knitting his brows; "do I hear you\r\nspeak aright? and do you, a born vassal of the Halidome, at the moment\r\nwhen I am destining to you such a noble expression of my good-will,\r\npropose exchanging my service for that of any other?"\r\n\r\n"My lord," said Halbert Glendinning, "it grieves me to think you hold\r\nme capable of undervaluing your gracious offer, or of exchanging\r\nyour service for another. But your noble proffer doth but hasten the\r\nexecution of a determination which I have long since formed."\r\n\r\n"Ay, my son," said the Abbot, "is it indeed so?--right early have\r\nyou learned to form resolutions without consulting those on whom you\r\nnaturally depend. But what may it be, this sagacious resolution, if I\r\nmay so far pray you?"\r\n\r\n"To yield up to my brother and mother," answered Halbert, "mine\r\ninterest in the fief of Glendearg, lately possessed by my father, Simon\r\nGlendinning: and having prayed your lordship to be the same kind and\r\ngenerous master to them, that your predecessors, the venerable Abbots\r\nof Saint Mary\'s, have been to my fathers in times past; for myself, I am\r\ndetermined to seek my fortune where I may best find it."\r\n\r\nDame Glendinning here ventured, emboldened by maternal anxiety, to\r\nbreak silence with an exclamation of "O my son!" Edward clinging to his\r\nbrother\'s side, half spoke, half whispered, a similar ejaculation, of\r\n"Brother! brother!"\r\n\r\nThe Sub-Prior took up the matter in a tone of grave reprehension, which,\r\nas he conceived, the interest he had always taken in the family at\r\nGlendearg required at his hand.\r\n\r\n"Wilful young man," he said, "what folly can urge thee to push back the\r\nhand that is stretched out to aid thee? What visionary aim hast\r\nthou before thee, that can compensate for the decent and sufficient\r\nindependence which thou art now rejecting with scorn?"\r\n\r\n"Four marks by the year, duly and truly," said the Kitchener.\r\n\r\n"Cow\'s-grass, doublet, and galligaskins," responded the Refectioner.\r\n\r\n"Peace, my brethren," said the Sub-Prior; "and may it please your\r\nlordship, venerable father, upon my petition, to allow this headstrong\r\nyouth a day for consideration, and it shall be my part so to\r\nindoctrinate him, as to convince him what is due on this occasion to\r\nyour lordship, and to his family, and to himself."\r\n\r\n"Your kindness, reverend father," said the youth, "craves my dearest\r\nthanks--it is the continuance of a long train of benevolence towards me,\r\nfor which I give you my gratitude, for I have nothing else to offer. It\r\nis my mishap, not your fault, that your intentions have been frustrated.\r\nBut my present resolution is fixed and unalterable. I cannot accept the\r\ngenerous offer of the Lord Abbot; my fate calls me elsewhere, to scenes\r\nwhere I shall end it or mend it."\r\n\r\n"By our Lady," said the Abbot, "I think the youth be mad indeed--or that\r\nyou, Sir Piercie, judged of him most truly, when you prophesied that he\r\nwould prove unfit for the promotion we designed him--it may be you knew\r\nsomething of this wayward humour before?"\r\n\r\n"By the mass, not I," answered Sir Piercie Shafton, with his usual\r\nindifference. "I but judged of him by his birth and breeding; for seldom\r\ndoth a good hawk come out of a kite\'s egg."\r\n\r\n"Thou art thyself a kite, and kestrel to boot," replied Halbert\r\nGlendinning, without a moment\'s hesitation.\r\n\r\n"This in our presence, and to a man of worship?" said the Abbot, the\r\nblood rushing to his face.\r\n\r\n"Yes, my lord," answered the youth; "even in your presence I return to\r\nthis gay man\'s face, the causeless dishonour--which he has flung on my\r\nname. My brave father, who fell in the cause of his country, demands\r\nthat justice at the hands of his son!"\r\n\r\n"Unmannered boy!" said the Abbot.\r\n\r\n"Nay, my good lord," said the knight, "praying pardon for the\r\ncoarse interruption, let me entreat you not to be wroth with this\r\nrustical--Credit me, the north wind shall as soon puff one of your rocks\r\nfrom its basis, as aught which I hold so slight and inconsiderate as the\r\nchurlish speech of an untaught churl, shall move the spleen of Piercie\r\nShafton."\r\n\r\n"Proud as you are, Sir Knight," said Halbert, "in your imagined\r\nsuperiority, be not too confident that you cannot be moved."\r\n\r\n"Faith, by nothing that thou canst urge," said Sir Piercie.\r\n\r\n"Knowest thou, then, this token?" said young Glendinning, offering to\r\nhim the silver bodkin he had received from the White Lady.\r\n\r\nNever was such an instant change, from the most contemptuous serenity,\r\nto the most furious state of passion, as that which Sir Piercie Shafton\r\nexhibited. It was the difference between a cannon lying quiet in its\r\nembrasure, and the same gun when touched by the linstock. He started\r\nup, every limb quivering with rage, and his features so inflamed and\r\nagitated by passion, that he more resembled a demoniac, than a man under\r\nthe regulation of reason. He clenched both his fists, and thrusting them\r\nforward, offered them furiously at the face of Glendinning, who was even\r\nhimself startled at the frantic state of excitation which his action\r\nhad occasioned. The next moment he withdrew them, struck his open palm\r\nagainst his own forehead, and rushed out of the room in a state of\r\nindescribable agitation. The whole matter had been so sudden, that no\r\nperson present had time to interfere.\r\n\r\nWhen Sir Piercie Shafton had left the apartment, there was a moment\'s\r\npause of astonishment; and then a general demand that Halbert\r\nGlendinning should instantly explain by what means he had produced such\r\na violent change in the deportment of the English cavalier.\r\n\r\n"I did nought to him," answered Halbert Glendinning, "but what you all\r\nsaw--am I to answer for his fantastic freaks of humour?"\r\n\r\n"Boy," said the Abbot, in his most authoritative manner, "these\r\nsubterfuges shall not avail thee. This is not a man to be driven from\r\nhis temperament without some sufficient cause. That cause was given by\r\nthee, and must have been known to thee. I command thee, as thou wilt\r\nsave thyself from worse measure, to explain to me by what means thou\r\nhast moved our friend thus--We choose not that our vassals shall drive\r\nour guests mad in our very presence, and we remain ignorant of the means\r\nwhereby that purpose is effected."\r\n\r\n"So may it please your reverence, I did but show him this token," said\r\nHalbert Glendinning, delivering it at the same time to the Abbot, who\r\nlooked at it with much attention, and then, shaking his head, gravely\r\ndelivered it to the Sub-Prior, without speaking a word.\r\n\r\nFather Eustace looked at the mysterious token with some attention; and\r\nthen addressing Halbert in a stern and severe voice, said, "Young man,\r\nif thou wouldst not have us suspect thee of some strange double-dealing\r\nin this matter, let us instantly know whence thou hadst this token, and\r\nhow it possesses an influence on Sir Piercie Shafton?"--It would have\r\nbeen extremely difficult for Halbert, thus hard pressed, to have either\r\nevaded or answered so puzzling a question. To have avowed the truth\r\nmight, in those times, have occasioned his being burnt at a stake,\r\nalthough, in ours, his confession would have only gained for him the\r\ncredit of a liar beyond all rational credibility. He was fortunately\r\nrelieved by the return of Sir Piercie Shafton himself, whose ear caught,\r\nas he entered, the sound of the Sub-Prior\'s question.\r\n\r\nWithout waiting until Halbert Glendinning replied, he came forward,\r\nwhispering to him as he passed, "Be secret--thou shalt have the\r\nsatisfaction thou hast dared to seek for."\r\n\r\nWhen he returned to his place, there were still marks of discomposure on\r\nhis brow; but, becoming apparently collected and calm, he looked around\r\nhim, and apologized for the indecorum of which he had been guilty, which\r\nhe ascribed to sudden and severe indisposition. All were silent, and\r\nlooked on each other with some surprise.\r\n\r\nThe Lord Abbot gave orders for all to retire from the apartment, save\r\nhimself, Sir Piercie Shafton, and the Sub-Prior. "And have an eye," he\r\nadded, "on that bold youth, that he escape not; for if he hath practised\r\nby charm, or otherwise, on the health of our worshipful guest, I swear\r\nby the alb and mitre which I wear, that his punishment shall be most\r\nexemplary."\r\n\r\n"My lord and venerable father," said Halbert, bowing respectfully, "fear\r\nnot but that I will abide my doom. I think you will best learn from the\r\nworshipful knight himself, what is the cause of his distemperature, and\r\nhow slight my share in it has been."\r\n\r\n"Be assured," said the knight, without looking up, however, while he\r\nspoke, "I will satisfy the Lord Abbot."\r\n\r\nWith these words the company retired, and with them young Glendinning.\r\nWhen the Abbot, the Sub-Prior, and the English knight were left alone,\r\nFather Eustace, contrary to his custom, could not help speaking the\r\nfirst. "Expound unto us, noble sir," he said, "by what mysterious means\r\nthe production of this simple toy could so far move your spirit, and\r\novercome your patience, after you had shown yourself proof to all the\r\nprovocation offered by this self-sufficient and singular youth?"\r\n\r\nThe knight took the silver bodkin from the good father\'s hand, looked at\r\nit with great composure, and, having examined it all over, returned it\r\nto the Sub-Prior, saying at the same time, "In truth, venerable father,\r\nI cannot but marvel, that the wisdom implied alike in your silver hairs,\r\nand in your eminent rank, should, like a babbling hound, (excuse the\r\nsimilitude,) open thus loudly on a false scent. I were, indeed, more\r\nslight to be moved than the leaves of the aspen-tree, which wag at the\r\nleast breath of heaven, could I be touched by such a trifle as this,\r\nwhich in no way concerns me more than if the same quantity of silver\r\nwere stricken into so many groats. Truth is, that from my youth upward,\r\nI have been subjected to such a malady as you saw me visited with even\r\nnow--a cruel and searching pain, which goeth through nerve and bone,\r\neven as a good brand in the hands of a brave soldier sheers through limb\r\nand sinew--but it passes away speedily, as you yourselves may judge."\r\n\r\n"Still," said the Sub-Prior, "this will not account for the youth\r\noffering to you this piece of silver, as a token by which you were\r\nto understand something, and, as we must needs conjecture, something\r\ndisagreeable."\r\n\r\n"Your reverence is to conjecture what you will," said Sir Piercie; "but\r\nI cannot pretend to lay your judgment on the right scent when I see it\r\nat fault. I hope I am not liable to be called upon to account for the\r\nfoolish actions of a malapert boy?"\r\n\r\n"Assuredly," said the Sub-Prior, "we shall prosecute no inquiry which\r\nis disagreeable to our guest. Nevertheless," said he, looking to his\r\nSuperior, "this chance may, in some sort, alter the plan your lordship\r\nhad formed for your worshipful guest\'s residence for a brief term in\r\nthis tower, as a place alike of secrecy and of security; both of which,\r\nin the terms which we now stand on with England, are circumstances to be\r\ndesired."\r\n\r\n"In truth," said the Abbot, "and the doubt is well thought on, were it\r\nas well removed; for I scarce know in the Halidome so fitting a place\r\nof refuge, yet see I not how to recommend it to our worshipful guest,\r\nconsidering the unrestrained petulance of this headstrong youth."\r\n\r\n"Tush! reverend sirs--what would you make of me?" said Sir Piercie\r\nShafton. "I protest, by mine honour, I would abide in this house were I\r\nto choose. What! I take no exceptions at the youth for showing a flash\r\nof spirit, though the spark may light on mine own head. I honour the\r\nlad for it. I protest I will abide here, and he shall aid me in striking\r\ndown a deer. I must needs be friends with him, and he be such a shot:\r\nand we will speedily send down to my lord Abbot a buck of the first\r\nhead, killed so artificially as shall satisfy even the reverend\r\nKitchener."\r\n\r\nThis was said with such apparent ease and good-humour, that the Abbot\r\nmade no farther observation on what had passed, but proceeded to\r\nacquaint his guest with the details of furniture, hangings, provisions,\r\nand so forth, which he proposed to send up to the Tower of Glendearg for\r\nhis accommodation. This discourse, seasoned with a cup or two of\r\nwine, served to prolong the time until the reverend Abbot ordered his\r\ncavalcade to prepare for their return to the Monastery.\r\n\r\n"As we have," he said, "in the course of this our toilsome journey,\r\nlost our meridian, [Footnote: The hour of repose at noon, which, in the\r\nmiddle ages, was employed in slumber, and which the monastic rules of\r\nnocturnal vigils rendered necessary.] indulgence shall be given to those\r\nof our attendants who shall, from very weariness, be unable to attend\r\nthe duty at prime, [Footnote: _Prime_ was the midnight service of the\r\nmonks.] and this by way of misericord or _indulgentia._" [Footnote:\r\n_Misericord,_ according to the learned work of Fosbrooke on British\r\nMonachism, meant not only an indulgence, or exoneration from particular\r\nduties, but also a particular apartment in a convent, where the monks\r\nassembled to enjoy such indulgences or allowances as were granted beyond\r\nthe rule.]\r\n\r\nHaving benevolently intimated a boon to his faithful followers, which he\r\nprobably judged would be far from unacceptable, the good Abbot, seeing\r\nall ready for his journey, bestowed his blessing on the assembled\r\nhousehold--gave his hand to be kissed by Dame Glendinning--himself\r\nkissed the cheek of Mary Avenel, and even of the Miller\'s maiden, when\r\nthey approached to render him the same homage--commanded Halbert to rule\r\nhis temper, and to be aiding and obedient in all things to the\r\nEnglish Knight--admonished Edward to be _discipulus impiger atque\r\nstrenuus_--then took a courteous farewell of Sir Piercie Shafton,\r\nadvising him to lie close, for fear of the English borderers, who might\r\nbe employed to kidnap him; and having discharged these various offices\r\nof courtesy, moved forth to the courtyard, followed by the whole\r\nestablishment. Here, with a heavy sigh, approaching to a groan, the\r\nvenerable father heaved himself upon his palfrey, whose dark purple\r\nhousings swept the ground; and, greatly comforted that the discretion of\r\nthe animal\'s pace would be no longer disturbed by the gambadoes of Sir\r\nPiercie and his prancing war-horse, he set forth at a sober and steady\r\ntrot upon his return to the Monastery.\r\n\r\nWhen the Sub-Prior had mounted to accompany his principal, his eye\r\nsought out Halbert, who, partly hidden by a projection of the outward\r\nwall of the court, stood apart from, and gazing upon the departing\r\ncavalcade, and the group which assembled around them. Unsatisfied with\r\nthe explanation he had received concerning the mysterious transaction\r\nof the silver bodkin, yet interesting himself in the youth, of whose\r\ncharacter he had formed a favourable idea, the worthy monk resolved\r\nto take an early opportunity of investigating that matter. In the\r\nmeanwhile, he looked upon Halbert with a serious and warning aspect, and\r\nheld up his finger to him as he signed farewell. He then joined the rest\r\nof the churchmen, and followed his Superior down the valley.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter the Twentieth.\r\n\r\n\r\n  I hope you\'ll give me cause to think you noble.\r\n  And do me right with your sword, sir, as becomes\r\n  One gentleman of honour to another;\r\n\r\n  All this is fair, sir--let us make no days on\'t,\r\n  I\'ll lead your way.\r\n\r\nLOVE\'S PILGRIMAGE.\r\n\r\nThe look and sign of warning which the Sub-Prior gave to Halbert\r\nGlendinning as they parted, went to his heart; for although he had\r\nprofited much less than Edward by the good man\'s instructions, he had\r\na sincere reverence for his person; and even the short time he had for\r\ndeliberation tended to show him he was embarked in a perilous adventure.\r\nThe nature of the provocation which he had given to Sir Piercie Shafton\r\nhe could not even conjecture; but he saw that it was of a mortal\r\nquality, and he was now to abide the consequences.\r\n\r\nThat he might not force these consequences forward by any premature\r\nrenewal of their quarrel, he resolved to walk apart for an hour, and\r\nconsider on what terms he was to meet this haughty foreigner. The time\r\nseemed propitious for his doing so without having the appearance\r\nof wilfully shunning the stranger, as all the members of the little\r\nhousehold were dispersing either to perform such tasks as had been\r\ninterrupted by the arrival of the dignitaries, or to put in order what\r\nhad been deranged by their visit.\r\n\r\nLeaving the tower, therefore, and descending, unobserved as he thought,\r\nthe knoll on which it stood, Halbert gained the little piece of level\r\nground which extended betwixt the descent of the hill, and the first\r\nsweep made by the brook after washing the foot of the eminence on which\r\nthe tower was situated, where a few straggling birch and oak-trees\r\nserved to secure him from observation. But scarcely had he reached the\r\nspot, when he was surprised to feel a smart tap upon the shoulder, and,\r\nturning around, he perceived he had been closely followed by Sir\r\nPiercie Shafton. When, whether from our state of animal spirits, want\r\nof confidence in the justice of our cause, or any other motive, our own\r\ncourage happens to be in a wavering condition, nothing tends so much\r\naltogether to disconcert us, as a great appearance of promptitude on\r\nthe part of our antagonist. Halbert Glendinning, both morally and\r\nconstitutionally intrepid, was nevertheless somewhat troubled at seeing\r\nthe stranger, whose resentment he had provoked, appear at once before\r\nhim, and with an aspect which boded hostility. But though his heart\r\nmight beat somewhat thicker, he was too high-spirited to exhibit any\r\nexternal signs of emotion.--"What is your pleasure, Sir Piercie?" he\r\nsaid to the English knight, enduring without apparent discomposure all\r\nthe terrors which his antagonist had summoned into his aspect.\r\n\r\n"What is my pleasure!" answered Sir Piercie; "a goodly question\r\nafter the part you have acted towards me!--Young man, I know not\r\nwhat infatuation has led thee to place thyself in direct and insolent\r\nopposition to one who is a guest of thy liege-lord the Abbot, and who,\r\neven from the courtesy due to thy mother\'s roof, had a right to remain\r\nthere without meeting insult. Neither do I ask, or care, by what means\r\nthou hast become possessed of the fatal secret by which thou hast dared\r\nto offer me open shame. But I must now tell thee, that the possession of\r\nit has cost thee thy life."\r\n\r\n"Not, I trust, if my hand and sword can defend it," replied Halbert,\r\nboldly.\r\n\r\n"True," said the Englishman, "I mean not to deprive thee of thy fair\r\nchance of self-defence. I am only sorry to think, that, young and\r\ncountry-bred as thou art, it can but little avail thee. But thou must be\r\nwell aware, that in this quarrel I shall use no terms of quarter."\r\n\r\n"Rely on it, proud man," answered the youth, "that I shall ask none; and\r\nalthough thou speakest as if I lay already at thy feet, trust me,\r\nthat as I am determined never to ask thy mercy, so I am not fearful of\r\nneeding it."\r\n\r\n"Thou wilt, then," said the knight, "do nothing to avert the certain\r\nfate which thou hast provoked with such wantonness?"\r\n\r\n"And how were that to be purchased?" replied Halbert Glendinning, more\r\nwith the wish of obtaining some farther insight into the terms on which\r\nhe stood with this stranger, than to make him the submission which he\r\nmight require.\r\n\r\n"Explain to me instantly," said Sir Piercie, "without equivocation or\r\ndelay, by what means thou wert enabled to wound my honour so deeply--and\r\nshouldst thou point out to me by so doing an enemy more worthy of my\r\nresentment, I will permit thine own obscure insignificance to draw a\r\nveil over thine insolence."\r\n\r\n"This is too high a flight," said Glendinning, fiercely, "for thine own\r\npresumption to soar without being checked. Thou hast come to my father\'s\r\nhouse, as well as I can guess, a fugitive and an exile, and thy first\r\ngreeting to its inhabitants has been that of contempt and injury. By\r\nwhat means I have been able to retort that contempt, let thine own\r\nconscience tell thee. Enough for me that I stand on the privilege of\r\na free Scotchman, and will brook no insult unreturned, and no injury\r\nunrequited."\r\n\r\n"It is well, then," said Sir Piercie Shafton; "we will dispute this\r\nmatter to-morrow morning with our swords. Let the time be daybreak, and\r\ndo thou assign the place. We will go forth as if to strike a deer."\r\n\r\n"Content," replied Halbert Glendinning: "I will guide thee to a\r\nspot where an hundred men might fight and fall without any chance of\r\ninterruption."\r\n\r\n"It is well," answered Sir Piercie Shafton. "Here then we part.--Many\r\nwill say, that in thus indulging the right of a gentleman to the son of\r\na clod-breaking peasant, I derogate from my sphere, even as the blessed\r\nsun would derogate should he condescend to compare and match his golden\r\nbeams with the twinkle of a pale, blinking, expiring, gross-fed taper.\r\nBut no consideration of rank shall prevent my avenging the insult thou\r\nhast offered me. We bear a smooth face, observe me, Sir Villagio, before\r\nthe worshipful inmates of yonder cabin, and to-morrow we try conclusions\r\nwith our swords." So saying, he turned away towards the tower.\r\n\r\nIt may not be unworthy of notice, that in the last speech only, had Sir\r\nPiercie used some of those flowers of rhetoric which characterized the\r\nusual style of his conversation. Apparently, a sense of wounded honour,\r\nand the deep desire of vindicating his injured feelings, had proved too\r\nstrong for the fantastic affectation of his acquired habits. Indeed,\r\nsuch is usually the influence of energy of mind, when called forth and\r\nexerted, that Sir Piercie Shafton had never appeared in the eyes of his\r\nyouthful antagonist half so much deserving of esteem and respect as\r\nin this brief dialogue, by which they exchanged mutual defiance. As he\r\nfollowed him slowly to the tower, he could not help thinking to himself,\r\nthat, had the English knight always displayed this superior tone of\r\nbearing and feeling, he would not probably have felt so earnestly\r\ndisposed to take offence at his hand. Mortal offence, however, had been\r\nexchanged, and the matter was to be put to mortal arbitrement.\r\n\r\nThe family met at the evening meal, when Sir Piercie Shafton extended\r\nthe benignity of his countenance and the graces of his conversation far\r\nmore generally over the party than he had hitherto condescended to do.\r\nThe greater part of his attention was, of course, still engrossed by\r\nhis divine inimitable Discretion, as he chose to term Mary Avenel; but,\r\nnevertheless there were interjectional flourishes to the Maid of the\r\nMill, under the title of Comely Damsel, and to the Dame, under that of\r\nWorthy Matron. Nay, lest he should fail to excite their admiration by\r\nthe graces of his rhetoric, he generously, and without solicitation,\r\nadded those of his voice; and after regretting bitterly the absence of\r\nhis viol-de-gamba, he regaled them with a song, "which," said he, "the\r\ninimitable Astrophel, whom mortals call Philip Sidney, composed in the\r\nnonage of his muse, to show the world what they are to expect from\r\nhis riper years, and which will one day see the light in that\r\nnot-to-be-paralleled perfection of human wit, which he has addressed\r\nto his sister, the matchless Parthenope, whom men call Countess of\r\nPembroke; a work," he continued, "whereof his friendship hath permitted\r\nme, though unworthy, to be an occasional partaker, and whereof I may\r\nwell say, that the deep afflictive tale which awakeneth our sorrows, is\r\nso relieved with brilliant similitudes, dulcet descriptions, pleasant\r\npoems, and engaging interludes, that they seem as the stars of the\r\nfirmament, beautifying the dusky robe of night. And though I wot well\r\nhow much the lovely and quaint language will suffer by my widowed voice,\r\nwidowed in that it is no longer matched by my beloved viol-de-gamba, I\r\nwill essay to give you a taste of the ravishing sweetness of the poesy\r\nof the un-to-be-imitated Astrophel."\r\n\r\nSo saying, he sung without mercy or remorse about five hundred verses,\r\nof which the two first and the four last may suffice for a specimen--\r\n\r\n  "What tongue can her perfections tell,\r\n  On whose each part all pens may dwell.\r\n\r\n  Of whose high praise arid praiseful bliss,\r\n  Goodness the pen. Heaven paper is;\r\n  The ink immortal fame doth send,\r\n  As I began so I must end."\r\n\r\nAs Sir Piercie Shafton always sung with his eyes half shut, it was not\r\nuntil, agreeably to the promise of poetry, he had fairly made an end,\r\nthat looking round, he discovered that the greater part of his audience\r\nhad, in the meanwhile, yielded to the charms of repose. Mary Avenel,\r\nindeed, from a natural sense of politeness, had contrived to keep awake\r\nthrough all the perplexities of the divine Astrophel; but Mysie was\r\ntransported in dreams back to the dusty atmosphere of her father\'s mill.\r\nEdward himself, who had given his attention for some time, had at length\r\nfallen fast asleep; and the good dame\'s nose, could its tones have\r\nbeen put in regulation, might have supplied the bass of the lamented\r\nviol-de-gamba. Halbert, however, who had no temptation to give way\r\nto the charms of slumber, remained awake with his eyes fixed on the\r\nsongster; not that he was better entertained with the words, or more\r\nravished with the execution, than the rest of the company, but rather\r\nbecause he admired, or perhaps envied, the composure, which could thus\r\nspend the evening in interminable madrigals, when the next morning was\r\nto be devoted to deadly combat. Yet it struck his natural acuteness\r\nof observation, that the eye of the gallant cavalier did now and\r\nthen, furtively as it were, seek a glance of his countenance, as if to\r\ndiscover how he was taking the exhibition of his antagonist\'s composure\r\nand serenity of mind.\r\n\r\nHe shall read nothing in my countenance, thought Halbert, proudly, that\r\ncan make him think my indifference less than his own.\r\n\r\nAnd taking from the shelf a bag full of miscellaneous matters collected\r\nfor the purpose, he began with great industry to dress hooks, and had\r\nfinished half-a-dozen of flies (we are enabled, for the benefit of those\r\nwho admire the antiquities of the gentle art of angling, to state that\r\nthey were brown hackles) by the time that Sir Piercie had arrived at the\r\nconclusion of his long-winded strophes of the divine Astrophel. So that\r\nhe also testified a magnanimous contempt of that which to-morrow should\r\nbring forth.\r\n\r\nAs it now waxed late, the family of Glendearg separated for the evening;\r\nSir Piercie first saying to the dame, that "her son Albert--"\r\n\r\n"Halbert," said Elspeth, with emphasis, "Halbert, after his goodsire,\r\nHalbert Brydone."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, I have prayed your son, Halbert, that we may strive\r\ntomorrow, with the sun\'s earliness, to wake a stag from his lair, that I\r\nmay see whether he be as prompt at that sport as fame bespeaks him."\r\n\r\n"Alas! sir," answered Dame Elspeth, "he is but too prompt, an you\r\ntalk of promptitude, at any thing that has steel at one end of it, and\r\nmischief at the other. But he is at your honourable disposal, and I\r\ntrust you will teach him how obedience is due to our venerable father\r\nand lord, the Abbot, and prevail with him to take the bow-bearer\'s place\r\nin fee; for, as the two worthy monks said, it will be a great help to a\r\nwidow-woman."\r\n\r\n"Trust me, good dame," replied Sir Piercie, "it is my purpose so to\r\nindoctrinate him touching his conduct and bearing towards his betters,\r\nthat he shall not lightly depart from the reverence due to them.--We\r\nmeet, then, beneath the birch-trees in the plain," he said, looking\r\nto Halbert, "so soon as the eye of day hath opened its lids."--Halbert\r\nanswered with a sign of acquiescence, and the knight proceeded, "And\r\nnow, having wished to my fairest Discretion those pleasant dreams which\r\nwave their pinions around the couch of sleeping beauty, and to this\r\ncomely damsel the bounties of Morpheus, and to all others the common\r\ngood-night, I will crave you leave to depart to my place of rest, though\r\nI may say with the poet,\r\n\r\n  \'Ah rest!--no rest but change of place and posture:\r\n  Ah sleep!--no sleep but worn-out Nature\'s swooning;\r\n  Ah bed!--no bed but cushion fill\'d with stones:\r\n  Rest, sleep, nor bed, await not on an exile.\'"\r\n\r\nWith a delicate obeisance he left the room, evading Dame Glendinning,\r\nwho hastened to assure him he would find his accommodations for repose\r\nmuch more agreeable than they had been the night before, there having\r\nbeen store of warm coverlets, and a soft feather-bed, sent up from the\r\nAbbey. But the good knight probably thought that the grace and effect\r\nof his exit would be diminished, if he were recalled from his heroics to\r\ndiscuss such sublunary and domestic topics, and therefore hastened away\r\nwithout waiting to hear her out.\r\n\r\n"A pleasant gentleman," said Dame Glendinning; "but I will warrant\r\nhim an humorous [Footnote: _Humorous_--full of whims--thus Shakspeare,\r\n"Humorous as winter."--The vulgar word humorsome comes nearest to\r\nthe meaning.]--And sings a sweet song, though it is somewhat of the\r\nlongest.--Well, I make mine avow he is goodly company--I wonder when he\r\nwill go away."\r\n\r\nHaving thus expressed her respect for her guest, not without intimation\r\nthat she was heartily tired of his company, the good dame gave the\r\nsignal for the family to disperse, and laid her injunctions on Halbert\r\nto attend Sir Piercie Shafton at daybreak, as he required.\r\n\r\nWhen stretched on his pallet by his brother\'s side, Halbert had no small\r\ncause to envy the sound sleep which instantly settled on the eyes of\r\nEdward, but refused him any share of its influence. He saw now too well\r\nwhat the spirit had darkly indicated, that, in granting the boon which\r\nhe had asked so unadvisedly, she had contributed more to his harm than\r\nhis good. He was now sensible, too late, of the various dangers and\r\ninconveniences with which his dearest friends were threatened, alike by\r\nhis discomfiture or his success in the approaching duel. If he fell, he\r\nmight say personally, "good-night all." But it was not the less certain\r\nthat he should leave a dreadful legacy of distress and embarrassment\r\nto his mother and family,--an anticipation which by no means tended to\r\nrender the front of death, in itself a grisly object, more agreeable to\r\nhis imagination. The vengeance of the Abbot, his conscience told him,\r\nwas sure to descend on his mother and brother, or could only be averted\r\nby the generosity of the victor--And Mary Avenel--he should have shown\r\nhimself, if he succumbed in the present combat, as inefficient in\r\nprotecting her, as he had been unnecessarily active in bringing disaster\r\non her, and on the house in which she had been protected from infancy.\r\nAnd to this view of the case were to be added all those imbittered and\r\nanxious feelings with which the bravest men, even in a better or less\r\ndoubtful quarrel, regard the issue of a dubious conflict, the first time\r\nwhen it has been their fate to engage in an affair of that nature.\r\n\r\nBut however disconsolate the prospect seemed in the event of his being\r\nconquered, Halbert could expect from victory little more than the safety\r\nof his own life, and the gratification of his wounded pride. To his\r\nfriends--to his mother and brother--especially to Mary Avenel--the\r\nconsequences of his triumph would be more certain destruction than the\r\ncontingency of his defeat and death. If the English knight survived, he\r\nmight in courtesy extend his protection to them; but if he fell, nothing\r\nwas likely to screen them from the vindictive measures which the Abbot\r\nand convent would surely adopt against the violation of the peace of\r\nthe Halidome, and the slaughter of a protected guest by one of their\r\nown vassals, within whose house they had lodged him for shelter. These\r\nthoughts, in which neither view of the case augured aught short of ruin\r\nto his family, and that ruin entirely brought on by his own rashness,\r\nwere thorns in Halbert Glendinning\'s pillow, and deprived his soul of\r\npeace and his eyes of slumber.\r\n\r\nThere appeared no middle course, saving one which was marked by\r\ndegradation, and which, even if he stooped to it, was by no means free\r\nof danger. He might indeed confess to the English knight the strange\r\ncircumstances which led to his presenting him with that token which the\r\nWhite Lady (in her displeasure as it now seemed) had given him, that\r\nhe might offer it to Sir Piercie Shafton. But to this avowal his pride\r\ncould not stoop, and reason, who is wonderfully ready to be of counsel\r\nwith pride on such occasions, offered many arguments to show it would be\r\nuseless as well as mean so far to degrade himself. "If I tell a tale so\r\nwonderful," thought he, "shall I not either be stigmatized as a liar,\r\nor punished as a wizard?--Were Sir Piercie Shafton generous, noble, and\r\nbenevolent, as the champions of whom we hear in romance, I might indeed\r\ngain his ear, and, without demeaning myself, escape from the\r\nsituation in which I am placed. But as he is, or at least seems to be,\r\nself-conceited, arrogant, vain, and presumptuous--I should but humble\r\nmyself in vain--and I will not humble myself!" he said, starting out\r\nof bed, grasping his broadsword, and brandishing it in the light of\r\nthe moon, which streamed through the deep niche that served them as a\r\nwindow; when, to his extreme surprise and terror, an airy form stood in\r\nthe moonlight, but intercepted not the reflection on the floor. Dimly as\r\nit was expressed, the sound of the voice soon made him sensible he saw\r\nthe White Lady.\r\n\r\nAt no time had her presence seemed so terrific to him; for when he had\r\ninvoked her, it was with the expectation of the apparition, and the\r\ndetermination to abide the issue. But now she had come uncalled, and her\r\npresence impressed him with a sense of approaching misfortune, and with\r\nthe hideous apprehension that he had associated himself with a demon,\r\nover whose motions he had no control, and of whose powers and quality he\r\nhad no certain knowledge. He remained, therefore, in mere terror, gazing\r\non the apparition, which chanted or recited in cadence the following\r\nlines--\r\n\r\n  "He whose heart for vengeance sued,\r\n  Must not shrink from shedding blood\r\n  The knot that thou hast tied with word,\r\n  Thou must loose by edge of sword."\r\n\r\n"Avaunt thee, false Spirit!" said Halbert Glendinning; "I have bought\r\nthy advice too dearly already--Begone in the name of God!"\r\n\r\nThe Spirit laughed; and the cold unnatural sound of her laughter had\r\nsomething in it more fearful than the usually melancholy tones of her\r\nvoice. She then replied,--\r\n\r\n  "You have summon\'d me once--you have summoned me twice,\r\n  And without e\'er a summons I come to you thrice;\r\n  Unask\'d for, unsued for, you came to my glen;\r\n  Unsued and unask\'d I am with you again."\r\n\r\nHalbert Glendinning gave way for a moment to terror, and called on his\r\nbrother, "Edward! waken, waken, for Our Lady\'s sake!"\r\n\r\nEdward awaked accordingly, and asked what he wanted.\r\n\r\n"Look out," said Halbert, "look up! seest thou no one in the room?"\r\n\r\n"No, upon my good word," said Edward, looking out.\r\n\r\n"What! seest thou nothing in the moonshine upon the floor there?"\r\n\r\n"No, nothing," answered Edward, "save thyself resting on thy naked\r\nsword. I tell thee, Halbert, thou shouldst trust more to thy spiritual\r\narms, and less to those of steel and iron. For this many a night hast\r\nthou started and moaned, and cried out of fighting, and of spectres, and\r\nof goblins--thy sleep hath not refreshed thee--thy waking hath been a\r\ndream.--Credit me, dear Halbert, say the _Pater_ and _Credo_, resign\r\nthyself to the protection of God, and thou wilt sleep sound and wake in\r\ncomfort."\r\n\r\n"It may be," said Halbert slowly, and having his eye still bent on the\r\nfemale form which to him seemed distinctly visible,--"it may be. But\r\ntell me, dear Edward, seest thou no one on the chamber floor but me?"\r\n\r\n"No one," answered Edward, raising himself on his elbow; "dear brother,\r\nlay aside thy weapon, say thy prayers, and lay thee down to rest."\r\n\r\nWhile he thus spoke, the Spirit smiled at Halbert as if in scorn; her\r\nwan cheek faded in the wan moonlight even before the smile had passed\r\naway, and Halbert himself no longer beheld the vision to which he had so\r\nanxiously solicited his brother\'s attention. "May God preserve my wits!"\r\nhe said, as, laying aside his weapon, he again threw himself on his bed.\r\n\r\n"Amen! my dearest brother," answered Edward; "but we must not provoke\r\nthat Heaven in our wantonness which we invoke in our misery.--Be not\r\nangry with me, my dear brother--I know not why you have totally of late\r\nestranged yourself from me--It is true, I am neither so athletic in\r\nbody, nor so alert in courage, as you have been from your infancy; yet,\r\ntill lately, you have not absolutely cast off my society--Believe me, I\r\nhave wept in secret, though I forbore to intrude myself on your privacy.\r\nThe time has been--when you held me not so cheap; and--when, if I could\r\nnot follow the game so closely, or mark it so truly as you, I could\r\nfill up our intervals of pastime with pleasant tales of the olden times,\r\nwhich I had read or heard, and which excited even your attention as\r\nwe sate and ate our provision by some pleasant spring--but now I have,\r\nthough I know not why, lost thy regard and affection.--Nay, toss not\r\nthy arms about thee thus wildly," said the younger brother; "from thy\r\nstrange dreams, I fear some touch of fever hath affected thy blood--let\r\nme draw closer around thee thy mantle."\r\n\r\n"Forbear," said Halbert--"your care is needless--your complaints are\r\nwithout reason--your fears on my account are in vain."\r\n\r\n"Nay, but hear me, brother," said Edward. "Your speech in sleep, and now\r\neven your waking dreams, are of beings which belong not to this world,\r\nor to our race--Our good Father Eustace says, that howbeit we may not\r\ndo well to receive all idle tales of goblins and spectres, yet there is\r\nwarrant from holy Scripture to believe, that the fiends haunt waste and\r\nsolitary places; and that those who frequent such wildernesses alone,\r\nare the prey, or the sport, of these wandering demons. And therefore,\r\nI pray thee, brother, let me go with you when you go next up the glen,\r\nwhere, as you well know, there be places of evil reputation--Thou\r\ncarest not for my escort; but, Halbert, such dangers are more safely\r\nencountered by the wise in judgment, than by the bold in bosom; and\r\nthough I have small cause to boast of my own wisdom, yet I have that\r\nwhich ariseth from the written knowledge of elder times."\r\n\r\nThere was a moment during this discourse, when Halbert had well-nigh\r\ncome to the resolution of disburdening his own breast, by intrusting\r\nEdward with all that weighed upon it. But when his brother reminded him\r\nthat this was the morning of a high holiday, and that, setting aside all\r\nother business or pleasure, he ought to go to the Monastery and\r\nshrive himself before Father Eustace, who would that day occupy the\r\nconfessional, pride stepped in and confirmed his wavering resolution.\r\n"I will not avow," he thought, "a tale so extraordinary, that I may be\r\nconsidered as an impostor or something worse--I will not fly from this\r\nEnglishman, whose arm and sword may be no better than my own. My fathers\r\nhave faced his betters, were he as much distinguished in battle as he is\r\nby his quaint discourse."\r\n\r\nPride, which has been said to save man, and woman too, from falling,\r\nhas yet a stronger influence on the mind when it embraces the cause of\r\npassion, and seldom fails to render it victorious over conscience and\r\nreason. Halbert, once determined, though not to the better course, at\r\nlength slept soundly, and was only awakened by the dawn of day.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter the Twenty-First.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Indifferent, but indifferent--pshaw, he doth it not\r\n  Like one who is his craft\'s master--ne\'er the less\r\n  I have seen a clown confer a bloody coxcomb\r\n  On one who was a master of defence.\r\n                                      OLD PLAY.\r\n\r\nWith the first gray peep of dawn, Halbert Glendinning arose and hastened\r\nto dress himself, girded on his weapon, and took a cross-bow in his\r\nhand, as if his usual sport had been his sole object. He groped his way\r\ndown the dark and winding staircase, and undid, with as little noise\r\nas possible, the fastenings of the inner door, and of the exterior iron\r\ngrate. At length he stood free in the court-yard, and looking up to the\r\ntower, saw a signal made with a handkerchief from the window. Nothing\r\ndoubting that it was his antagonist, he paused, expecting him. But it\r\nwas Mary Avenel, who glided like a spirit from under the low and rugged\r\nportal.\r\n\r\nHalbert was much surprised, and felt, he knew not why, like one caught\r\nin the act of a meditated trespass. The presence of Mary Avenel had till\r\nthat moment never given him pain. She spoke, too, in a tone where sorrow\r\nseemed to mingle with reproach, while she asked him with emphasis, "What\r\nhe was about to do?"\r\n\r\nHe showed his cross-bow, and was about to express the pretext he had\r\nmeditated, when Mary interrupted him.\r\n\r\n"Not so, Halbert--that evasion were unworthy of one whose word has\r\nhitherto been truth. You meditate not the destruction of the deer--your\r\nhand and your heart are aimed at other game--you seek to do battle with\r\nthis stranger."\r\n\r\n"And wherefore should I quarrel with our guest?" answered Halbert,\r\nblushing deeply.\r\n\r\n"There are, indeed, many reasons why you should not," replied\r\nthe maiden, "nor is there one of avail wherefore you should--yet\r\nnevertheless, such a quarrel you are now searching after."\r\n\r\n"Why should you suppose so, Mary?" said Halbert, endeavouring to hide\r\nhis conscious purpose--"he is my mother\'s guest--he is protected by\r\nthe Abbot and the community, who are our masters--he is of high degree\r\nalso,--and wherefore should you think that I can, or dare, resent a\r\nhasty word, which he has perchance thrown out against me more from the\r\nwantonness of his wit, than the purpose of his heart?"\r\n\r\n"Alas!" answered the maiden, "the very asking that question puts your\r\nresolution beyond a doubt. Since your childhood you were ever daring,\r\nseeking danger rather than avoiding it--delighting in whatever had the\r\nair of adventure and of courage: and it is not from fear that you will\r\nnow blench from your purpose--Oh, let it then be from pity!--from pity,\r\nHalbert, to your aged mother, whom your death or victory will alike\r\ndeprive of the comfort and stay of her age."\r\n\r\n"She has my brother Edward," said Halbert, turning suddenly from her.\r\n\r\n"She has indeed," said Mary Avenel, "the calm, the noble-minded, the\r\nconsiderate Edward, who has thy courage, Halbert, without thy fiery\r\nrashness,--thy generous spirit, with more of reason to guide it. He\r\nwould not have heard his mother, would not have heard his adopted\r\nsister, beseech him in vain not to ruin himself, and tear up their\r\nfuture hopes of happiness and protection."\r\n\r\nHalbert\'s heart swelled as he replied to this reproach. "Well--what\r\navails it speaking?--you have him that is better than me--wiser,\r\nmore considerate--braver, for aught I know--you are provided with a\r\nprotector, and need care no more for me."\r\n\r\nAgain he turned to depart, but Mary Avenel laid her hand on his arm so\r\ngently that he scarce felt her hold, yet felt that it was impossible\r\nfor him to strike it off. There he stood, one foot advanced to leave the\r\ncourt-yard, but so little determined on departure, that he resembled a\r\ntraveller arrested by the spell of a magician, and unable either to quit\r\nthe attitude of motion, or to proceed on his course.\r\n\r\nMary Avenel availed herself of his state of suspense. "Hear me," she\r\nsaid, "hear me, Halbert!--I am an orphan, and even Heaven hears the\r\norphan--I have been the companion of your infancy, and if _you_ will not\r\nhear me for an instant, from whom may Mary Avenel claim so poor a boon?"\r\n\r\n"I hear you," said Halbert Glendinning, "but be brief, dear Mary--you\r\nmistake the nature of my business--it is but a morning of summer sport\r\nwhich we propose."\r\n\r\n"Say not thus," said the maiden, interrupting him, "say not thus to\r\nme--others thou mayst deceive, but me thou canst not--There has been\r\nthat in me from the earliest youth, which fraud flies from, and which\r\nimposture cannot deceive. For what fate has given me such a power I know\r\nnot; but bred an ignorant maiden, in this sequestered valley, mine eyes\r\ncan too often see what man would most willingly hide--I can judge of the\r\ndark purpose, though it is hid under the smiling brow, and a glance of\r\nthe eye says more to me than oaths and protestations do to others."\r\n\r\n"Then," said Halbert, "if thou canst so read the human heart,--say,\r\ndear Mary--what dost thou see in mine?--tell me that--say that what thou\r\nseest--what thou readest in this bosom, does not offend thee--say but\r\n_that_, and thou shalt be the guide of my actions, and mould me now and\r\nhenceforward to honour or to dishonour at thy own free will!"\r\n\r\nMary Avenel became first red, and then deadly pale, as Halbert\r\nGlendinning spoke. But when, turning round at the close of his address,\r\nhe took her hand, she gently withdrew it, and replied, "I cannot read\r\nthe heart, Halbert, and I would not of my will know aught of yours, save\r\nwhat beseems us both--I only can judge of signs, words, and actions of\r\nlittle outward import, more truly than those around me, as my eyes, thou\r\nknowest, have seen objects not presented to those of others."\r\n\r\n"Let them gaze then on one whom they shall never see more," said\r\nHalbert, once more turning from her, and rushing out of the court-yard\r\nwithout again looking back.\r\n\r\nMary Avenel gave a faint scream, and clasped both her hands firmly on\r\nher forehead and eyes. She had been a minute in this attitude, when\r\nshe was thus greeted by a voice from behind: "Generously done, my most\r\nclement Discretion, to hide those brilliant eyes from the far inferior\r\nbeams which even now begin to gild the eastern horizon--Certes,\r\nperil there were that Phoebus, outshone in splendour, might in very\r\nshamefacedness turn back his ear, and rather leave the world in\r\ndarkness, than incur the disgrace of such an encounter--Credit me,\r\nlovely Discretion--"\r\n\r\nBut as Sir Piercie Shafton (the reader will readily set down these\r\nflowers of eloquence to the proper owner) attempted to take Mary\r\nAvenel\'s hand, in order to proceed in his speech, she shook him abruptly\r\noff, and regarding him with an eye which evinced terror and agitation,\r\nrushed past him into the tower.\r\n\r\nThe knight stood looking after her with a countenance in which contempt\r\nwas strongly mingled with mortification. "By my knighthood!" he\r\nejaculated, "I have thrown away upon this rude rustic Phidel? a speech,\r\nwhich the proudest beauty at the court of Felicia (so let me call the\r\nElysium from which I am banished!) might have termed the very matins of\r\nCupid. Hard and inexorable was the fate that sent thee thither, Piercie\r\nShafton, to waste thy wit upon country wenches, and thy valour upon\r\nhob-nailed clowns! But that insult--that affront--had it been offered\r\nto me by the lowest plebeian, he must have died for it by my hand, in\r\nrespect the enormity of the offence doth countervail the inequality of\r\nhim by whom it is given. I trust I shall find this clownish roisterer\r\nnot less willing to deal in blows than in taunts."\r\n\r\nWhile he held this conversation with himself, Sir Piercie Shafton was\r\nhastening to the little tuft of birch-trees which had been assigned\r\nas the place of meeting. He greeted his antagonist with a courtly\r\nsalutation, followed by this commentary: "I pray you to observe, that\r\nI doff my hat to you, though so much my inferior in rank, without\r\nderogation on my part, inasmuch as my having so far honoured you in\r\nreceiving and admitting your defiance, doth, in the judgment of the best\r\nmartialists, in some sort and for the time, raise you to a level with\r\nme--an honour which you may and ought to account cheaply purchased, even\r\nwith the loss of your life, if such should chance to be the issue of\r\nthis duello."\r\n\r\n"For which condescension," said Halbert, "I have to thank the token\r\nwhich I presented to you."\r\n\r\nThe knight changed colour, and grinded his teeth with rage--"Draw your\r\nweapon!" said he to Glendinning.\r\n\r\n"Not in this spot," answered the youth; "we should be liable to\r\ninterruption--Follow me, and I will bring you to a place where we shall\r\nencounter no such risk."\r\n\r\nHe proceeded to walk up the glen, resolving that their place of combat\r\nshould be in the entrance of the Corri-nan-shian; both because the spot,\r\nlying under the reputation of being haunted, was very little frequented,\r\nand also because he regarded it as a place which to him might be termed\r\nfated, and which he therefore resolved should witness his death\r\nor victory. They walked up the glen for some time in silence, like\r\nhonourable enemies who did not wish to contend with words, and who had\r\nnothing friendly to exchange with each other. Silence, however, was\r\nalways an irksome state with Sir Piercie and, moreover, his anger was\r\nusually a hasty and short-lived passion. As, therefore, he went forth,\r\nin his own idea, in all love and honour towards his antagonist, he saw\r\nnot any cause for submitting longer to the painful restraint of positive\r\nsilence. He began by complimenting Halbert on the alert activity with\r\nwhich he surmounted the obstacles and impediments of the way.\r\n\r\n"Trust me," said he, "worthy rustic, we have not a lighter or a firmer\r\nstep in our courtlike revels, and if duly set forth by a silk hose, and\r\ntrained unto that stately exercise, your leg would make an indifferent\r\ngood show in a pavin or a galliard. And I doubt nothing," he added,\r\n"that you have availed yourself of some opportunity to improve yourself\r\nin the art of fence, which is more akin than dancing to our present\r\npurpose?"\r\n\r\n"I know nothing more of fencing," said Halbert, "than hath been taught\r\nme by an old shepherd of ours, called Martin, and at whiles a lesson\r\nfrom Christie of the Clinthill--for the rest, I must trust to good\r\nsword, strong arm, and sound heart."\r\n\r\n"Marry and I am glad of it, young Audacity, (I will call you my\r\nAudacity, and you will call me your Condescension, while we are on these\r\nterms of unnatural equality,) I am glad of your ignorance with all my\r\nheart. For we martialists proportion the punishments which we inflict\r\nupon our opposites, to the length and hazard of the efforts wherewith\r\nthey oppose themselves to us. And I see not why you, being but a tyro,\r\nmay not be held sufficiently punished for your outrecuidance, and\r\norgillous presumption, by the loss of an ear, an eye, or even a finger,\r\naccompanied by some flesh-wound of depth and severity, suited to your\r\nerror--whereas, had you been able to stand more effectually on\r\nyour defence, I see not how less than your life could have atoned\r\nsufficiently for your presumption."\r\n\r\n"Now, by God and Our Lady," said Halbert, unable any longer to restrain\r\nhimself, "thou art thyself over-presumptuous, who speakest thus daringly\r\nof the issue of a combat which is not yet even begun--Are you a god,\r\nthat you already dispose of my life and limbs? or are you a judge in\r\nthe justice-air, telling at your ease and without risk, how the head and\r\nquarters of a condemned criminal are to be disposed of?"\r\n\r\n"Not so, O thou,--whom I have well permitted to call thyself my\r\nAudacity. I, thy Condescension, am neither a god to judge the issue of\r\nthe combat before it is fought, nor a judge to dispose at my ease and\r\nin safety of the limbs and head of a condemned criminal; but I am an\r\nindifferent good master of fence, being the first pupil of the first\r\nmaster of the first school of fence that our royal England affords, the\r\nsaid master being no other than the truly noble, and all-unutterably\r\nskilful Vincentio Saviola, from whom I learned the firm step, quick eye,\r\nand nimble hand--of which qualities thou, O my most rustical Audacity,\r\nart full like to reap the fruits so soon as we shall find a piece of\r\nground fitting for such experiments."\r\n\r\nThey had now reached the gorge of the ravine, where Halbert had at\r\nfirst intended to stop; but when he observed the narrowness of the level\r\nground, he began to consider that it was only by superior agility that\r\nhe could expect to make up his deficiency in the science, as it was\r\ncalled, of defence. He found no spot which afforded sufficient room to\r\ntraverse for this purpose, until he gained the well-known fountain, by\r\nwhose margin, and in front of the huge rock from which it sprung, was\r\nan amphitheatre of level turf, of small space indeed, compared with the\r\ngreat height of the cliffs with which it was surrounded on every point\r\nsave that from which the rivulet issued forth, yet large enough for\r\ntheir present purpose.\r\n\r\nWhen they had reached this spot of ground, fitted well by its gloom\r\nand sequestered situation to be a scene of mortal strife, both were\r\nsurprised to observe that a grave was dug close by the foot of the rock\r\nwith great neatness and regularity, the green turf being laid down\r\nupon the one side, and the earth thrown out in a heap upon the other. A\r\nmattock and shovel lay by the verge of the grave.\r\n\r\nSir Piercie Shafton bent his eye with unusual seriousness upon Halbert\r\nGlendinning, as he asked him sternly, "Does this bode treason, young\r\nman? And have you purpose to set upon me here as in an emboscata or\r\nplace of vantage?"\r\n\r\n"Not on my part, by Heaven!" answered the youth: "I told no one of our\r\npurpose, nor would I for the throne of Scotland take odds against a\r\nsingle arm."\r\n\r\n"I believe thou wouldst not, mine Audacity," said the knight,\r\nresuming the affected manner which was become a second nature to him;\r\n"nevertheless this fosse is curiously well shaped, and might be\r\nthe masterpiece of Nature\'s last bed-maker, I would say the\r\nsexton--Wherefore, let us be thankful to chance or some unknown friend,\r\nwho hath thus provided for one of us the decencies of sepulture, and let\r\nus proceed to determine which shall have the advantage of enjoying this\r\nplace of undisturbed slumber."\r\n\r\nSo saying, he stripped off his doublet and cloak, which he folded\r\nup with great care, and deposited upon a large stone, while Halbert\r\nGlendinning, not without some emotion, followed his example. Their\r\nvicinity to the favourite haunt of the White Lady led him to form\r\nconjectures concerning the incident of the grave--"It must have been her\r\nwork!" he thought: "the Spirit foresaw and has provided for the fatal\r\nevent of the combat--I must return from this place a homicide, or I must\r\nremain here for ever!"\r\n\r\nThe bridge seemed now broken down behind him, and the chance of coming\r\noff honourably without killing or being killed, (the hope of which issue\r\nhas cheered the sinking heart of many a duellist,) seemed now altogether\r\nto be removed. Yet the very desperation of his situation gave him, on\r\nan instant\'s reflection, both firmness and courage, and presented to him\r\none sole alternative, conquest, namely, or death.\r\n\r\n"As we are here," said Sir Piercie Shafton, "unaccompanied by any\r\npatrons or seconds, it were well you should pass your hands over my\r\nsides, as I shall over yours; not that I suspect you to use any quaint\r\ndevice of privy armour, but in order to comply with the ancient and\r\nlaudable custom practised on all such occasions."\r\n\r\nWhile complying with his antagonist\'s humour, Halbert Glendinning went\r\nthrough this ceremony, Sir Piercie Shafton did not fail to solicit his\r\nattention to the quality and fineness of his wrought and embroidered\r\nshirt--"In this very shirt," said he, "O mine Audacity!--I say in\r\nthis very garment, in which I am now to combat a Scottish rustic\r\nlike thyself, it was my envied lot to lead the winning party at that\r\nwonderous match at ballon, made betwixt the divine Astrophel, (our\r\nmatchless Sidney,) and the right honourable my very good lord of Oxford.\r\nAll the beauties of Felicia (by which name I distinguish our beloved\r\nEngland) stood in the gallery, waving their kerchiefs at each turn of\r\nthe game, and cheering the winners by their plaudits. After which noble\r\nsport we were refreshed by a suitable banquet, whereat it pleased the\r\nnoble Urania (being the unmatched Countess of Pembroke) to accommodate\r\nme with her fan for the cooling my somewhat too much inflamed visage, to\r\nrequite which courtesy, I said, casting my features into a smiling,\r\nyet melancholy fashion, O divinest Urania! receive again that too fatal\r\ngift, which not like the Zephyr cooleth, but like the hot breath of the\r\nSirocco, heateth yet more that which is already inflamed. Whereupon,\r\nlooking upon me somewhat scornfully, yet not so but what the experienced\r\ncourtier might perceive a certain cast of approbative affection----"\r\n\r\nHere the knight was interrupted by Halbert, who had waited with\r\ncourteous patience for some little time, till he found, that far from\r\ndrawing to a close, Sir Piercie seemed rather inclined to wax prolix in\r\nhis reminiscences.\r\n\r\n"Sir Knight," said the youth, "if this matter be not very much to the\r\npurpose, we will, if you object not, proceed to that which we have in\r\nhand. You should have abidden in England had you desired to waste time\r\nin words, for here we spend it in blows."\r\n\r\n"I crave your pardon, most rusticated Audacity," answered Sir Piercie;\r\n"truly I become oblivious of every thing beside, when the recollections\r\nof the divine court of Felicia press upon my wakened memory, even as\r\na saint is dazzled when he bethinks him of the beatific vision. Ah,\r\nfelicitous Feliciana! delicate nurse of the fair, chosen abode of the\r\nwise, the birth-place and cradle of nobility, the temple of courtesy,\r\nthe fane of sprightly chivalry--Ah, heavenly court, or rather courtly\r\nheaven! cheered with dances, lulled asleep with harmony, wakened\r\nwith sprightly sports and tourneys, decored with silks and tissues,\r\nglittering with diamonds and jewels, standing on end with double-piled\r\nvelvets, satins, and satinettas!"\r\n\r\n"The token, Sir Knight, the token!" exclaimed Halbert Glendinning, who,\r\nimpatient of Sir Piercie\'s interminable oratory, reminded him of the\r\nground of their quarrel, as the best way to compel him to the purpose of\r\ntheir meeting.\r\n\r\nAnd he judged right; for Sir Piercie Shafton no sooner heard him speak,\r\nthan he exclaimed, "Thy death-hour has struck--betake thee to thy\r\nsword--Via!"\r\n\r\nBoth swords were unsheathed, and the combatants commenced their\r\nengagement. Halbert became immediately aware, that, as he had expected,\r\nhe was far inferior to his adversary in the use of his weapon. Sir\r\nPiercie Shafton had taken no more than his own share of real merit, when\r\nhe termed himself an absolutely good fencer; and Glendinning soon found\r\nthat he should have great difficulty in escaping with life and honour\r\nfrom such a master of the sword. The English knight was master of all\r\nthe mystery of the _stoccata, imbrocata, punto-reverso, incartata_, and\r\nso forth, which the Italian masters of defence had lately introduced\r\ninto general practice. But Glendinning, on his part, was no novice in\r\nthe principles of the art, according to the old Scottish fashion, and\r\npossessed the first of all qualities, a steady and collected mind. At\r\nfirst, being desirous to try the skill, and become acquainted with the\r\nplay of his enemy, he stood on his defence, keeping his foot, hand, eye,\r\nand body, in perfect unison, and holding his sword short, and with the\r\npoint towards his antagonist\'s face, so that Sir Piercie, in order\r\nto assail him, was obliged to make actual passes, and could not avail\r\nhimself of his skill in making feints; while, on the other hand, Halbert\r\nwas prompt to parry these attacks, either by shifting his ground or with\r\nthe sword. The consequence was, that after two or three sharp attempts\r\non the part of Sir Piercie, which were evaded or disconcerted by the\r\naddress of his opponent, he began to assume the defensive in his turn,\r\nfearful of giving some advantage by being repeatedly the assailant. But\r\nHalbert was too cautious to press on a swordsman whose dexterity had\r\nalready more than once placed him within a hair\'s breadth of death,\r\nwhich he had only escaped by uncommon watchfulness and agility.\r\n\r\nWhen each had made a feint or two, there was a pause in the conflict,\r\nboth as if by one assent dropping their swords\' point, and looking on\r\neach other for a moment without speaking. At length Halbert Glendinning,\r\nwho felt perhaps more uneasy on account of his family than he had done\r\nbefore he had displayed his own courage, and proved the strength of his\r\nantagonist, could not help saying, "Is the subject of our quarrel, Sir\r\nKnight, so mortal, that one of our two bodies must needs fill up that\r\ngrave? or may we with honour, having proved ourselves against each\r\nother, sheathe our swords and depart friends?"\r\n\r\n"Valiant and most rustical Audacity," said the Southron knight, "to no\r\nman on earth could you have put a question on the code of honour, who\r\nwas more capable of rendering you a reason. Let us pause for the space\r\nof one venue, until I give you my opinion on this dependence, [Footnote:\r\n_Dependence_--A phrase among the brethren of the sword for an existing\r\nquarrel.] for certain it is, that brave men should not run upon their\r\nfate like brute and furious wild beasts, but should slay each other\r\ndeliberately, decently, and with reason. Therefore, if we coolly examine\r\nthe state of our dependence, we may the better apprehend whether\r\nthe sisters three have doomed one of us to expiate the same with his\r\nblood--Dost thou understand me?"\r\n\r\n"I have heard Father Eustace," said Halbert, after a moment\'s\r\nrecollection, "speak of the three furies, with their thread and their\r\nshears."\r\n\r\n"Enough--enough,"--interrupted Sir Piercie Shafton, crimsoning with a\r\nnew fit of rage, "the thread of thy life is spun!"\r\n\r\nAnd with these words he attacked with the utmost ferocity the Scottish\r\nyouth, who had but just time to throw himself into a posture of defence.\r\nBut the rash fury of the assailant, as frequently happens, disappointed\r\nits own purpose; for, as he made a desperate thrust, Halbert Glendinning\r\navoided it, and ere the knight could recover his weapon, requited him\r\n(to use his own language) with a resolute stoccata, which passed through\r\nhis body, and Sir Piercie Shafton fell to the ground.\r\n\r\n        *       *       *      *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter the Twenty-Second.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Yes, life hath left him--every busy thought,\r\n  Each fiery passion, every strong affection,\r\n  All sense of outward ill and inward sorrow,\r\n  Are fled at once from the pale trunk before me;\r\n  And I have given that which spoke and moved,\r\n  Thought, acted, suffer\'d as a living man,\r\n  To be a ghastly form of bloody clay,\r\n  Soon the foul food for reptiles.\r\n                                        OLD PLAY.\r\n\r\nI believe few successful duellists (if the word successful can be\r\napplied to a superiority so fatal) have beheld their dead antagonist\r\nstretched on the earth at their feet, without wishing they could redeem\r\nwith their own blood that which it has been their fate to spill. Least\r\nof all could such indifference be the lot of so young a man as Halbert\r\nGlendinning, who, unused to the sight of human blood, was not only\r\nstruck with sorrow, but with terror, when he beheld Sir Piercie Shafton\r\nlie stretched on the green-sward before him, vomiting gore as if\r\nimpelled by the strokes of a pump. He threw his bloody sword on the\r\nground, and hastened to kneel and support him, vainly striving, at the\r\nsame time, to stanch his wound, which seemed rather to bleed inwardly\r\nthan externally.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate knight spoke at intervals, when the syncope would permit\r\nhim, and his words, so far as intelligible, partook of his affected and\r\nconceited, yet not ungenerous character.\r\n\r\n"Most rustical youth," he said, "thy fortune hath prevailed over\r\nknightly skill--and Audacity hath overcome Condescension, even as the\r\nkite hath sometimes hawked at and struck down the falcon-gentle.--Fly\r\nand save thyself!--Take my purse--it is in the nether pocket of my\r\ncarnation-coloured hose--and is worth a clown\'s acceptance. See that\r\nmy mails, with my vestments, be sent to the Monastery of Saint\r\nMary\'s"--(here his voice grew weak, and his mind and recollection\r\nseemed to waver)--"I bestow the cut velvet jerkin, with close breeches\r\nconforming--for--oh!--the good of my soul."\r\n\r\n"Be of good comfort, sir," said Halbert, half distracted with his agony\r\nof pity and remorse. "I trust you shall yet do well--Oh for a leech!"\r\n\r\n"Were there twenty physicians, O most generous Audacity, and that were\r\na grave spectacle--I might not survive, my life is ebbing\r\nfast.--Commend me to the rustical nymph whom I called my Discretion--O\r\nClaridiana!--true empress of this bleeding heart--which now bleedeth in\r\nsad earnest!--Place me on the ground at my length, most rustical victor,\r\nborn to quench the pride of the burning light of the most felicitous\r\ncourt of Feliciana--O saints and angels---knights and ladies--masques\r\nand theatres--quaint devices--chain-work and broidery--love, honour, and\r\nbeauty!----"\r\n\r\nWhile muttering these last words, which slid from him, as it were\r\nunawares, while doubtless he was calling to mind the glories of the\r\nEnglish court, the gallant Sir Piercie Shafton stretched out his\r\nlimbs--groaned deeply, shut his eyes, and became motionless.\r\n\r\nThe victor tore his hair for very sorrow, as he looked on the pale\r\ncountenance of his victim. Life, he thought, had not utterly fled, but\r\nwithout better aid than his own, he saw not how it could be preserved.\r\n\r\n"Why," he exclaimed in vain penitence, "why did I provoke him to an\r\nissue so fatal! Would to God I had submitted to the worst insult man\r\ncould receive from man, rather than be the bloody instrument of this\r\nbloody deed--and doubly cursed be this evil-boding spot, which, haunted\r\nas I knew it to be by a witch or a devil, I yet chose for the place of\r\ncombat! In any other place, save this, there had been help to be gotten\r\nby speed of foot, or by uplifting of voice--but here there is no one to\r\nbe found by search, no one to hear my shouts, save the evil spirit who\r\nhas counselled this mischief. It is not her hour--I will essay the spell\r\nhowsoever; and if she can give me aid, she _shall_ do it, or know of\r\nwhat a madman is capable even against those of another world!"\r\n\r\nHe spurned his bloody shoe from his foot, and repeated the spell with\r\nwhich the reader is well acquainted; but there was neither voice,\r\napparition, nor signal of answer. The youth, in the impatience of his\r\ndespair, and with the rash hardihood which formed the basis of his\r\ncharacter, shouted aloud, "Witch--Sorceress--Fiend!--art thou deaf to\r\nmy cries of help, and so ready to appear and answer those of vengeance?\r\nArise and speak to me, or I will choke up thy fountain, tear down thy\r\nhollybush, and leave thy haunt as waste and bare as thy fatal assistance\r\nhas made me waste of comfort and bare of counsel!"--This furious\r\nand raving invocation was suddenly interrupted by a distant sound,\r\nresembling a hollo, from the gorge of the ravine. "Now may Saint Mary\r\nbe praised," said the youth, hastily fastening his sandal, "I hear\r\nthe voice of some living man, who may give me counsel and help in this\r\nfearful extremity."\r\n\r\nHaving donned his sandal, Halbert Glendinning, hallooing at intervals,\r\nin answer to the sound which he had heard, ran with the speed of a\r\nhunted buck down the rugged defile, as if paradise had been before him,\r\nhell and all her furies behind, and his eternal happiness or misery had\r\ndepended upon the speed which he exerted. In a space incredibly short\r\nfor any one but a Scottish mountaineer having his nerves strung by the\r\ndeepest and most passionate interest, the youth reached the entrance\r\nof the ravine, through which the rill that flows down Corri-nan-shian\r\ndischarges itself, and unites with the brook that waters the little\r\nvalley of Glendearg.\r\n\r\nHere he paused, and looked around him upwards and downwards through the\r\nglen, without perceiving a human form. His heart sank within him. But\r\nthe windings of the glen intercepted his prospect, and the person, whose\r\nvoice he had heard, might therefore, be at no great distance, though not\r\nobvious to his sight. The branches of an oak-tree, which shot straight\r\nout from the face of a tall cliff, proffered to his bold spirit,\r\nsteady head, and active limbs, the means of ascending it as a place of\r\nout-look, although the enterprise was what most men would have shrunk\r\nfrom. But by one bound from the earth, the active youth caught hold of\r\nthe lower branch, and swung himself up into the tree, and in a minute\r\nmore gained the top of the cliff, from which he could easily descry a\r\nhuman figure descending the valley. It was not that of a shepherd, or\r\nof a hunter, and scarcely any others used to traverse this deserted\r\nsolitude, especially coming from the north, since the reader may\r\nremember that the brook took its rise from an extensive and dangerous\r\nmorass which lay in that direction.\r\n\r\nBut Halbert Glendinning did not pause to consider who the traveller\r\nmight be, or what might be the purpose of his journey. To know that he\r\nsaw a human being, and might receive, in the extremity of his distress,\r\nthe countenance and advice of a fellow-creature, was enough for him at\r\nthe moment. He threw himself from the pinnacle of the cliff once more\r\ninto the arms of the projecting oak-tree, whose boughs waved in middle\r\nair, anchored by the roots in a huge rift or chasm of the rock. Catching\r\nat the branch which was nearest to him, he dropped himself from that\r\nheight upon the ground; and such was the athletic springiness of his\r\nyouthful sinews, that he pitched there as lightly, and with as little\r\ninjury, as the falcon stooping from her wheel.\r\n\r\nTo resume his race at full speed up the glen, was the work of an\r\ninstant; and as he turned angle after angle of the indented banks of the\r\nvalley, without meeting that which he sought, he became half afraid that\r\nthe form which he had seen at such a distance had already melted into\r\nthin air, and was either a deception of his own imagination, or of the\r\nelementary spirits by which the valley was supposed to be haunted.\r\n\r\nBut to his inexpressible joy, as he turned round the base of a huge\r\nand distinguished crag, he saw, straight before and very near to him,\r\na person, whose dress, as he viewed it hastily, resembled that of a\r\npilgrim.\r\n\r\nHe was a man of advanced life, and wearing a long beard, having on his\r\nhead a large slouched hat, without either band or brooch. His dress was\r\na tunic of black serge, which, like those commonly called hussar-cloaks,\r\nhad an upper part, which covered the arms and fell down on the lower;\r\na small scrip and bottle, which hung at his back, with a stout staff in\r\nhis hand, completed his equipage. His step was feeble, like that of one\r\nexhausted by a toilsome journey.\r\n\r\n"Save ye, good father!" said the youth. "God and Our Lady have sent you\r\nto my assistance."\r\n\r\n"And in what, my son, can so frail a creature as I am, be of service to\r\nyou?" said the old man, not a little surprised at being thus accosted\r\nby so handsome a youth, his features discomposed by anxiety, his face\r\nflushed with exertion, his hands and much of his dress stained with\r\nblood. "A man bleeds to death in the valley here, hard by. Come with\r\nme--come with me! You are aged--you have experience--you have at least\r\nyour senses--and mine have well nigh left me."\r\n\r\n"A man--and bleeding to death--and here in this desolate spot!" said the\r\nstranger.\r\n\r\n"Stay not to question it, father," said the youth, "but come instantly\r\nto his rescue. Follow me,--follow me, without an instant\'s delay."\r\n\r\n"Nay, but, my son," said the old man, "we do not lightly follow the\r\nguides who present themselves thus suddenly in the bosom of a howling\r\nwilderness. Ere I follow thee, thou must expound to me thy name, thy\r\npurpose, and thy cause."\r\n\r\n"There is no time to expound any thing," said Halbert; "I tell thee a\r\nman\'s life is at stake, and thou must come to aid him, or I will carry\r\nthee thither by force!"\r\n\r\n"Nay, thou shalt not need," said the traveller; "if it indeed be as thou\r\nsayest, I will follow thee of free-will--the rather that I am not wholly\r\nunskilled in leech-craft, and have in my scrip that which may do thy\r\nfriend a service--Yet walk more slowly, I pray thee, for I am already\r\nwell-nigh forespent with travel."\r\n\r\nWith the indignant impatience of the fiery steed when compelled by\r\nhis rider to keep pace with some slow drudge upon the highway, Halbert\r\naccompanied the wayfarer, burning with anxiety which he endeavoured to\r\nsubdue, that he might not alarm his companion, who was obviously afraid\r\nto trust him. When they reached the place where they were to turn off\r\nthe wider glen into the Corri, the traveller made a doubtful pause, as\r\nif unwilling to leave the broader path--"Young man," he said, "if thou\r\nmeanest aught but good to these gray hairs, thou wilt gain little by thy\r\ncruelty--I have no earthly treasure to tempt either robber or murderer."\r\n\r\n"And I," said the youth, "am neither--and yet--God of Heaven!--I _may_\r\nbe a murderer, unless your aid comes in time to this wounded wretch!"\r\n\r\n"Is it even so," said the traveller; "and do human passions disturb the\r\nbreast of nature, even in her deepest solitude?--Yet why should I marvel\r\nthat where darkness abides the works of darkness should abound?--By its\r\nfruits is the tree known--Lead on, unhappy youth--I follow thee!"\r\n\r\nAnd with better will to the journey than he had evinced hitherto, the\r\nstranger exerted himself to the uttermost, and seemed to forget his own\r\nfatigue in his efforts to keep pace with his impatient guide.\r\n\r\nWhat was the surprise of Halbert Glendinning, when, upon arriving at the\r\nfatal spot, he saw no appearance of the body of Sir Piercie Shafton!\r\nThe traces of the fray were otherwise sufficiently visible. The knight\'s\r\ncloak had indeed vanished as well as his body, but his doublet remained\r\nwhere he had laid it down, and the turf on which he had been stretched\r\nwas stained with blood in many a dark crimson spot.\r\n\r\nAs he gazed round him in terror and astonishment, Halbert\'s eyes fell\r\nupon the place of sepulture which had so lately appeared to gape for a\r\nvictim. It was no longer open, and it seemed that earth had received the\r\nexpected tenant; for the usual narrow hillock was piled over what had\r\nlately been an open grave, and the green sod was adjusted over all with\r\nthe accuracy of an experienced sexton. Halbert stood aghast. The idea\r\nrushed on his mind irresistibly, that the earth-heap before him enclosed\r\nwhat had lately been a living, moving, and sentient fellow-creature,\r\nwhom, on little provocation, his fell act had reduced to a clod of the\r\nvalley, as senseless and as cold as the turf under which he rested. The\r\nhand that scooped the grave had completed its word; and whose hand could\r\nit be save that of the mysterious being of doubtful quality, whom his\r\nrashness had invoked, and whom he had suffered to intermingle in his\r\ndestinies?\r\n\r\nAs he stood with clasped hands and uplifted eyes, bitterly ruing his\r\nrashness, he was roused by the voice of the stranger, whose suspicions\r\nof his guide had again been awakened by finding the scene so different\r\nfrom what Halbert had led him to expect.--"Young man," he said, "hast\r\nthou baited thy tongue with falsehood to cut perhaps only a few days\r\nfrom the life of one whom Nature will soon call home, without guilt on\r\nthy part to hasten his journey?"\r\n\r\n"By the blessed Heaven!--by our dear Lady!" ejaculated Halbert--\r\n\r\n"Swear not at all!" said the stranger, interrupting him, "neither\r\nby Heaven, for it is God\'s throne, nor by earth, for it is his\r\nfootstool--nor by the creatures whom he hath made, for they are but\r\nearth and clay as we are. Let thy yea be yea, and thy nay, nay. Tell me\r\nin a word, why and for what purpose thou hast feigned a tale, to lead a\r\nbewildered traveller yet farther astray?"\r\n\r\n"As I am a Christian man," said Glendinning, "I left him here bleeding\r\nto death--and now I nowhere spy him, and much I doubt that the tomb that\r\nthou seest has closed on his mortal remains."\r\n\r\n"And who is he for whose fate thou art so anxious?" said the stranger;\r\n"or how is it possible that this wounded man could have been either\r\nremoved from, or interred in, a place so solitary?"\r\n\r\n"His name," said Halbert, after a moment\'s pause, "is Piercie\r\nShafton--there, on that very spot I left him bleeding; and what power\r\nhas conveyed him hence, I know no more than thou dost."\r\n\r\n"Piercie Shafton?" said the stranger; "Sir Piercie Shafton of Wilverton,\r\na kinsman, as it is said, of the great Piercie of Northumberland? If\r\nthou hast slain him, to return to the territories of the proud Abbot is\r\nto give thy neck to the gallows. He is well known, that Piercie Shafton;\r\nthe meddling tool of wiser plotters--a harebrained trafficker in\r\ntreason--a champion of the Pope, employed as a forlorn hope by those\r\nmore politic heads, who have more will to work mischief, than valour to\r\nencounter danger.--Come with me, youth, and save thyself from the evil\r\nconsequences of this deed--Guide me to the Castle of Avenel, and thy\r\nreward shall be protection and safety."\r\n\r\nAgain Halbert paused, and summoned his mind to a hasty council. The\r\nvengeance with which the Abbot was likely to visit the slaughter of\r\nShafton, his friend, and in some measure his guest, was likely to\r\nbe severe; yet, in the various contingencies which he had considered\r\nprevious to their duel, he had unaccountably omitted to reflect what was\r\nto be his line of conduct in case of Sir Piercie falling by his hand.\r\nIf he returned to Glendearg, he was sure to draw on his whole family,\r\nincluding Mary Avenel, the resentment of the Abbot and community,\r\nwhereas it was possible that flight might make him be regarded as the\r\nsole author of the deed, and might avert the indignation of the\r\nmonks from the rest of the inhabitants of his paternal tower. Halbert\r\nrecollected also the favour expressed for the household, and especially\r\nfor Edward, by the Sub-Prior; and he conceived that he could, by\r\ncommunicating his own guilt to that worthy ecclesiastic, when at a\r\ndistance from Glendearg, secure his powerful interposition in favour\r\nof his family. These thoughts rapidly passed through his mind, and he\r\ndetermined on flight. The stranger\'s company and his promised protection\r\ncame in aid of that resolution; but he was unable to reconcile the\r\ninvitation which the old man gave him to accompany him for safety to the\r\nCastle of Avenel, with the connexions of Julian, the present usurper of\r\nthat inheritance.\r\n\r\n"Good father," he said, "I fear that you mistake the man with whom you\r\nwish me to harbour. Avenel guided Piercie Shafton into Scotland, and his\r\nhenchman, Christie of the Clinthill, brought the Southron hither."\r\n\r\n"Of that," said the old man, "I am well aware. Yet if thou wilt trust\r\nto me, as I have shown no reluctance to confide in thee, thou shalt find\r\nwith Julian Avenel welcome, or at least safety."\r\n\r\n"Father," replied Halbert, "though I can ill reconcile what thou sayest\r\nwith what Julian Avenel hath done, yet caring little about the safety of\r\na creature so lost as myself, and as thy words seem those of truth and\r\nhonesty, and finally, as thou didst render thyself frankly up to my\r\nconduct, I will return the confidence thou hast shown, and accompany\r\nthee to the Castle of Avenel by a road which thou thyself couldst never\r\nhave discovered." He led the way, and the old man followed for some time\r\nin silence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter the Twenty-Third.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \'Tis when the wound is stiffening with the cold.\r\n  The warrior first feels pain--\'tis when the heat\r\n  And fiery fever of his soul is pass\'d,\r\n  The sinner feels remorse.\r\n                               OLD PLAY.\r\n\r\nThe feelings of compunction with which Halbert Glendinning was visited\r\nupon this painful occasion, were deeper than belonged to an age and\r\ncountry in which human life was held so cheap. They fell far short\r\ncertainly of those which might have afflicted a mind regulated by better\r\nreligious precepts, and more strictly trained under social laws; but\r\nstill they were deep and severely felt, and divided in Halbert\'s heart\r\neven the regret with which he parted from Mary Avenel and the tower of\r\nhis fathers.\r\n\r\nThe old traveller walked silently by his side for some time, and then\r\naddressed him.--"My son, it has been said that sorrow must speak or\r\ndie--Why art thou so much cast down?--Tell me thy unhappy tale, and\r\nit may be that my gray head may devise counsel and aid for your young\r\nlife."\r\n\r\n"Alas!" said Halbert Glendinning, "can you wonder why I am cast\r\ndown?--I am at this instant a fugitive from my father\'s house, from my\r\nmother, and from my friends, and I bear on my head the blood of a man\r\nwho injured me but in idle words, which I have thus bloodily requited.\r\nMy heart now tells me I have done evil--it were harder than these rocks\r\nif it could bear unmoved the thought, that I have sent this man to a\r\nlong account, unhousled and unshrieved."\r\n\r\n"Pause there, my son," said the traveller. "That thou hast defaced God\'s\r\nimage in thy neighbour\'s person--that thou hast sent dust to dust in\r\nidle wrath or idler pride, is indeed a sin of the deepest dye--that\r\nthou hast cut short the space which Heaven might have allowed him for\r\nrepentance, makes it yet more deadly--but for all this there is balm in\r\nGilead."\r\n\r\n"I understand you not, father," said Halbert, struck by the solemn tone\r\nwhich was assumed by his companion.\r\n\r\nThe old man proceeded. "Thou hast slain thine enemy--it was a cruel\r\ndeed: thou hast cut him off perchance in his sins--it is a fearful\r\naggravation. Do yet by my counsel, and in lieu of him whom thou hast\r\nperchance consigned to the kingdom of Satan, let thine efforts wrest\r\nanother subject from the reign of the Evil One."\r\n\r\n"I understand you, father," said Halbert; "thou wouldst have me atone\r\nfor my rashness by doing service to the soul of my adversary--But how\r\nmay this be? I have no money to purchase masses, and gladly would I\r\ngo barefoot to the Holy Land to free his spirit from purgatory, only\r\nthat--"\r\n\r\n"My son," said the old man, interrupting him, "the sinner for whose\r\nredemption I entreat you to labour, is not the dead but the living. It\r\nis not for the soul of thine enemy I would exhort thee to pray--that has\r\nalready had its final doom from a Judge as merciful as he is just; nor,\r\nwert thou to coin that rock into ducats, and obtain a mass for each one,\r\nwould it avail the departed spirit. Where the tree hath fallen, it must\r\nlie. But the sapling, which hath in it yet the vigour and juice of life,\r\nmay be bended to the point to which it ought to incline."\r\n\r\n"Art thou a priest, father?" said the young man, "or by what commission\r\ndost thou talk of such high matters?"\r\n\r\n"By that of my Almighty Master," said the traveller, "under whose banner\r\nI am an enlisted soldier."\r\n\r\nHalbert\'s acquaintance with religious matters was no deeper than could\r\nbe derived from the Archbishop of Saint Andrew\'s Catechism, and the\r\npamphlet called the Twapennie Faith, both which were industriously\r\ncirculated and recommended by the monks of Saint Mary\'s. Yet, however\r\nindifferent and superficial a theologian, he began to suspect that he\r\nwas now in company with one of the gospellers, or heretics, before\r\nwhose influence the ancient system of religion now tottered to the very\r\nfoundation. Bred up, as may well be presumed, in a holy horror against\r\nthese formidable sectaries, the youth\'s first feelings were those of a\r\nloyal and devoted church vassal. "Old man," he said, "wert thou able to\r\nmake good with thy hand the words that thy tongue hath spoken against\r\nour Holy Mother Church, we should have tried upon this moor which of our\r\ncreeds hath the better champion."\r\n\r\n"Nay," said the stranger, "if thou art a true soldier of Rome, thou wilt\r\nnot pause from thy purpose because thou hast the odds of years and of\r\nstrength on thy side. Hearken to me, my son. I have showed thee how to\r\nmake thy peace with Heaven, and thou hast rejected my proffer. I will\r\nnow show thee how thou shalt make thy reconciliation with the powers of\r\nthis world. Take this gray head from the frail body which supports it,\r\nand carry it to the chair of proud Abbot Boniface; and when thou tellest\r\nhim thou hast slain Piercie Shafton, and his ire rises at the deed, lay\r\nthe head of Henry Warden at his foot, and thou shalt have praise instead\r\nof censure."\r\n\r\nHalbert Glendinning stepped back in surprise. "What! are you that Henry\r\nWarden so famous among the heretics, that even Knox\'s name is scarce\r\nmore frequently in their mouths? Art thou he, and darest thou to\r\napproach the Halidome of Saint Mary\'s?"\r\n\r\n"I am Henry Warden, of a surety," said the old man, "far unworthy to\r\nbe named in the same breath with Knox, but yet willing to venture on\r\nwhatever dangers my master\'s service may call me to."\r\n\r\n"Hearken to me, then," said Halbert; "to slay thee, I have no heart--to\r\nmake thee prisoner, were equally to bring thy blood on my head--to leave\r\nthee in this wild without a guide, were little better. I will conduct\r\nthee, as I promised, in safety to the Castle of Avenel; but breathe not,\r\nwhile we are on the journey, a word against the doctrines of the holy\r\nchurch of which I am an unworthy--but though an ignorant, a zealous\r\nmember.--When thou art there arrived, beware of thyself--there is a\r\nhigh price upon thy head, and Julian Avenel loves the glance of gold\r\nbonnet-pieces." [Footnote: A gold coin of James V., the most beautiful\r\nof the Scottish series; so called because the effigy of the sovereignty\r\nis represented wearing a bonnet.]\r\n\r\n"Yet thou sayest not," answered the Protestant preacher, for such he\r\nwas, "that for lucre he would sell the blood of his guest?"\r\n\r\n"Not if thou comest an invited stranger, relying on his faith," said\r\nthe youth; "evil as Julian may be, he dare not break the rites of\r\nhospitality; for, loose as we on these marches may be in all other\r\nties, these are respected amongst us even to idolatry, and his\r\nnearest relations would think it incumbent on them to spill his blood\r\nthemselves, to efface the disgrace such treason would bring upon their\r\nname and lineage. But if thou goest self-invited, and without assurance\r\nof safety, I promise thee thy risk is great."\r\n\r\n"I am in God\'s hand," answered the preacher; "it is on His errand that I\r\ntraverse these wilds amidst dangers of every kind; while I am useful for\r\nmy master\'s service, they shall not prevail against me, and when, like\r\nthe barren fig-tree, I can no longer produce fruit, what imports it when\r\nor by whom the axe is laid to the root?"\r\n\r\n"Your courage and devotion," said Glendinning, "are worthy of a better\r\ncause."\r\n\r\n"That," said Warden, "cannot be--mine is the very best."\r\n\r\nThey continued their journey in silence, Halbert Glendinning tracing\r\nwith the utmost accuracy the mazes of the dangerous and intricate\r\nmorasses and hills which divided the Halidome from the barony of\r\nAvenel. From time to time he was obliged to stop, in order to assist\r\nhis companion to cross the black intervals of quaking bog, called in the\r\nScottish dialect _hags_, by which the firmer parts of the morass were\r\nintersected.\r\n\r\n"Courage, old man," said Halbert, as he saw his companion almost\r\nexhausted with fatigue, "we shall soon be upon hard ground. And yet soft\r\nas this moss is, I have seen the merry falconers go through it as light\r\nas deer when the quarry was upon the flight."\r\n\r\n"True, my son," answered Warden, "for so I will still call you, though\r\nyou term me no longer father; and even so doth headlong youth pursue its\r\npleasures, without regard to the mire and the peril of the paths through\r\nwhich they are hurried."\r\n\r\n"I have already told thee," answered Halbert Glendinning, sternly, "that\r\nI will hear nothing from thee that savours of doctrine."\r\n\r\n"Nay, but, my son," answered Warden, "thy spiritual father himself\r\nwould surely not dispute the truth of what I have now spoken for your\r\nedification!"\r\n\r\nGlendinning stoutly replied, "I know not how that may be--but I wot\r\nwell it is the fashion of your brotherhood to bait your hook with fair\r\ndiscourse, and to hold yourselves up as angels of light, that you may\r\nthe better extend the kingdom of darkness."\r\n\r\n"May God," replied the preacher, "pardon those who have thus reported\r\nof his servants! I will not offend thee, my son, by being instant out of\r\nseason--thou speakest but as thou art taught--yet sure I trust that so\r\ngoodly a youth will be still rescued, like a brand from the burning."\r\n\r\nWhile he thus spoke, the verge of the morass was attained, and their\r\npath lay on the declivity. Green-sward it was, and, viewed from a\r\ndistance, chequered with its narrow and verdant line the dark-brown\r\nheath which it traversed, though the distinction was not so easily\r\ntraced when they were walking on it. [Footnote: This sort of path,\r\nvisible when looked at from a distance, but not to be seen when you\r\nare upon it, is called on the Border by the significant name of a\r\nBlind-road.] The old man pursued his journey with comparative ease; and,\r\nunwilling again to awaken the jealous zeal of his young companion\r\nfor the Roman faith, he discoursed on other matters. The tone of his\r\nconversation was still grave, moral, and instructive. He had travelled\r\nmuch, and knew both the language and manners of other countries,\r\nconcerning which Halbert Glendinning, already anticipating the\r\npossibility of being obliged to leave Scotland for the deed he had done,\r\nwas naturally and anxiously desirous of information. By degrees he\r\nwas more attracted by the charms of the stranger\'s conversation than\r\nrepelled by the dread of his dangerous character as a heretic, and\r\nHalbert had called him father more than once, ere the turrets of Avenel\r\nCastle came in view.\r\n\r\nThe situation of this ancient fortress was remarkable. It occupied a\r\nsmall rocky islet in a mountain lake, or _tarn,_ as such a piece of\r\nwater is called in Westmoreland. The lake might be about a mile in\r\ncircumference, surrounded by hills of considerable height, which, except\r\nwhere old trees and brushwood occupied the ravines that divided them\r\nfrom each other, were bare and heathy. The surprise of the spectator was\r\nchiefly excited by finding a piece of water situated in that high and\r\nmountainous region, and the landscape around had features which might\r\nrather be termed wild, than either romantic or sublime; yet the scene\r\nwas not without its charms. Under the burning sun of summer, the clear\r\nazure of the deep unruffled lake refreshed the eye, and impressed the\r\nmind with a pleasing feeling of deep solitude. In winter, when the snow\r\nlay on the mountains around, these dazzling masses appeared to ascend\r\nfar beyond their wonted and natural height, while the lake, which\r\nstretched beneath, and filled their bosom with all its frozen waves, lay\r\nlike the surface of a darkened and broken mirror around the black and\r\nrocky islet, and the walls of the gray castle with which it was crowned.\r\n\r\nAs the castle occupied, either with its principal buildings, or with its\r\nflanking and outward walls, every projecting point of rock, which served\r\nas its site, it seemed as completely surrounded by water as the nest of\r\na wild swan, save where a narrow causeway extended betwixt the islet and\r\nthe shore. But the fortress was larger in appearance than in reality;\r\nand of the buildings which it actually contained, many had become\r\nruinous and uninhabitable. In the times of the grandeur of the Avenel\r\nfamily, these had been occupied by a considerable garrison of followers\r\nand retainers, but they were now in a great measure deserted; and Julian\r\nAvenel would probably have fixed his habitation in a residence better\r\nsuited to his diminished fortunes, had it not been for the great\r\nsecurity which the situation of the old castle afforded to a man of his\r\nprecarious and perilous mode of life. Indeed, in this respect, the spot\r\ncould scarce have been more happily chosen, for it could be rendered\r\nalmost completely inaccessible at the pleasure of the inhabitant. The\r\ndistance betwixt the nearest shore and the islet was not indeed above an\r\nhundred yards; but then the causeway which connected them was extremely\r\nnarrow, and completely divided by two cuts, one in the mid-way between\r\nthe islet and shore, and another close under the outward gate of\r\nthe castle. These formed a formidable, and almost insurmountable\r\ninterruption to any hostile approach. Each was defended by a drawbridge,\r\none of which, being that nearest to the castle, was regularly raised at\r\nall times during the day, and both were lifted at night. [Footnote:\r\nIt is in vain to search near Melrose for any such castle as is here\r\ndescribed. The lakes at the head of the Yarrow, and those at the rise of\r\nthe water of Ale, present no object of the kind. But in Vetholm Loch, (a\r\nromantic sheet of water, in the dry march, as it is called,) there\r\nare the remains of a fortress called Lochside Tower, which, like the\r\nsupposed Castle of Avenel, is built upon an island, and connected with\r\nthe land by a causeway. It is much smaller than the Castle of Avenel is\r\ndescribed, consisting only of a single tower.]\r\n\r\nThe situation of Julian Avenel, engaged in a variety of feuds, and a\r\nparty to almost every dark and mysterious transaction which was on foot\r\nin that wild and military frontier, required all these precautions\r\nfor his security. His own ambiguous and doubtful course of policy had\r\nincreased these dangers; for as he made professions to both parties in\r\nthe state, and occasionally united more actively with either the one or\r\nthe other, as chanced best to serve his immediate purpose, he could\r\nnot be said to have either firm allies and protectors, or determined\r\nenemies. His life was a life of expedients and of peril; and while,\r\nin pursuit of his interest, he made all the doubles which he thought\r\nnecessary to attain his object, he often overran his prey, and missed\r\nthat which he might have gained by observing a straighter course.\r\n\r\n       *      *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter the Twenty-Fourth.\r\n\r\n\r\n  I\'ll walk on tiptoe; arm my eye with caution,\r\n  My heart with courage, and my hand with weapon,\r\n  Like him who ventures on a lion\'s den.\r\n                             OLD PLAY.\r\n\r\nWhen, issuing from the gorge of a pass which terminated upon the lake,\r\nthe travellers came in sight of the ancient castle of Avenel, the old\r\nman looked with earnest attention upon the scene before him. The castle\r\nwas, as we have said, in many places ruinous, as was evident, even at\r\nthis distance, by the broken, rugged, and irregular outline of the walls\r\nand of the towers. In others it seemed more entire, and a pillar of dark\r\nsmoke, which ascended from the chimneys of the donjon, and spread\r\nits long dusky pennon through the clear ether, indicated that it was\r\ninhabited. But no corn-fields or enclosed pasture-grounds on the side\r\nof the lake showed that provident attention to comfort and subsistence\r\nwhich usually appeared near the houses of the greater, and even of the\r\nlesser barons. There were no cottages with their patches of infield, and\r\ntheir crofts and gardens, surrounded by rows of massive sycamores; no\r\nchurch with its simple tower in the valley; no herds of sheep among\r\nthe hills; no cattle on the lower ground; nothing which intimated the\r\noccasional prosecution of the arts of peace and of industry. It was\r\nplain that the inhabitants, whether few or numerous, must be considered\r\nas the garrison of the castle, living within its defended precincts, and\r\nsubsisting by means which were other than peaceful.\r\n\r\nProbably it was with this conviction that the old man, gazing on the\r\ncastle, muttered to himself, "_Lapis offensionis et petra scandali!_"\r\nand then, turning to Halbert Glendinning, he added, "We may say of\r\nyonder fort as King James did of another fastness in this province,\r\nthat he who built it was a thief in his heart." [Footnote: It was of\r\nLochwood, the hereditary fortress of the Johnstones of Aunandale, a\r\nstrong castle situated in the centre of a quaking bog, that James VI.\r\nmade this remark.]\r\n\r\n"But it was not so," answered Glendinning; "yonder castle was built\r\nby the old lords of Avenel, men as much beloved in peace as they\r\nwere respected in war. They were the bulwark of the frontiers against\r\nforeigners, and the protectors of the natives from domestic oppression.\r\nThe present usurper of their inheritance no more resembles them, than\r\nthe night-prowling owl resembles a falcon, because she builds on the\r\nsame rock."\r\n\r\n"This Julian Avenel, then, holds no high place in the love and regard of\r\nhis neighbours?" said Warden.\r\n\r\n"So little," answered Halbert, "that besides the jack-men and riders\r\nwith whom he has associated himself, and of whom he has many at his\r\ndisposal, I know of few who voluntarily associate with him. He has been\r\nmore than once outlawed both by England and Scotland, his lands declared\r\nforfeited, and his head set at a price. But in these unquiet times, a\r\nman so daring as Julian Avenel has ever found some friends willing to\r\nprotect him against the penalties of the law, on condition of his secret\r\nservices."\r\n\r\n"You describe a dangerous man," replied Warden.\r\n\r\n"You may have experience of that," replied the youth, "if you deal\r\nnot the more warily;--though it may be that he also has forsaken the\r\ncommunity of the church, and gone astray in the path of heresy."\r\n\r\n"What your blindness terms the path of heresy," answered the reformer,\r\n"is indeed the straight and narrow way, wherein he who walks turns not\r\naside, whether for worldly wealth or for worldly passions. Would to\r\nGod this man were moved by no other and no worse spirit than that which\r\nprompts my poor endeavours to extend the kingdom of Heaven! This Baron\r\nof Avenel is personally unknown to me, is not of our congregation or of\r\nour counsel; yet I bear to him charges touching my safety, from those\r\nwhom he must fear if he does not respect them, and upon that assurance I\r\nwill venture upon his hold--I am now sufficiently refreshed by these few\r\nminutes of repose."\r\n\r\n"Take then this advice for your safety," said Halbert, "and believe that\r\nit is founded upon the usage of this country and its inhabitants. If you\r\ncan better shift for yourself, go not to the Castle of Avenel--if you do\r\nrisk going thither, obtain from him, if possible, his safe conduct, and\r\nbeware that he swears it by the Black Rood--And lastly, observe whether\r\nhe eats with you at the board, or pledges you in the cup; for if he\r\ngives you not these signs of welcome, his thoughts are evil towards\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Alas!" said the preacher, "I have no better earthly refuge for the\r\npresent than these frowning towers, but I go thither trusting to aid\r\nwhich is not of this earth--But thou, good youth, needest thou trust\r\nthyself in this dangerous den?"\r\n\r\n"I," answered Halbert, "am in no danger. I am well known to Christie of\r\nthe Clinthill, the henchman of this Julian Avenel; and, what is a yet\r\nbetter protection, I have nothing either to provoke malice or to tempt\r\nplunder."\r\n\r\nThe tramp of a steed, which clattered along the shingly banks of the\r\nloch, was now heard behind them; and, when they looked back, a rider was\r\nvisible, his steel cap and the point of his long lance glancing in the\r\nsetting sun, as he rode rapidly towards them.\r\n\r\nHalbert Glendinning soon recognized Christie of the Clinthill, and made\r\nhis companion aware that the henchman of Julian Avenel was approaching.\r\n\r\n"Ha, youngling!" said Christie to Halbert, as he came up to them, "thou\r\nhast made good my word at last, and come to take service with my noble\r\nmaster, hast thou not? Thou shalt find a good friend and a true; and\r\nere Saint Barnaby come round again, thou shalt know every pass betwixt\r\nMillburn Plain and Netherby, as if thou hadst been born with a jack\r\non thy back, and a lance in thy hand.--What old carle hast thou with\r\nthee?--He is not of the brotherhood of Saint Mary\'s--at least he has\r\nnot the buist [Footnote: _Buist_--The brand, or mark, set upon sheep or\r\ncattle, by their owners.] of these black cattle."\r\n\r\n"He is a wayfaring man," said Halbert, "who has concerns with Julian of\r\nAvenel. For myself, I intend to go to Edinburgh to see the court and the\r\nQueen, and when I return hither we will talk of your proffer. Meantime,\r\nas thou hast often invited me to the castle, I crave hospitality there\r\nto-night for myself and my companion."\r\n\r\n"For thyself and welcome, young comrade," replied Christie; "but we\r\nharbour no pilgrims, nor aught that looks like a pilgrim."\r\n\r\n"So please you," said Warden, "I have letters of commendation to thy\r\nmaster from a sure friend, whom he will right willingly oblige in higher\r\nmatters than in affording me a brief protection.--And I am no pilgrim,\r\nbut renounce the same, with all its superstitious observances." He\r\noffered his letters to the horseman, who shook his head.\r\n\r\n"These," he said, "are matters for my master, and it will be well if he\r\ncan read them himself; for me, sword and lance are my book and psalter,\r\nand have been since I was twelve years old. But I will guide you to the\r\ncastle, and the Baron of Avenel will himself judge of your errand."\r\n\r\nBy this time the party had reached the causeway, along which Christie\r\nadvanced at a trot, intimating his presence to the warders within the\r\ncastle by a shrill and peculiar whistle. At this signal the farther\r\ndrawbridge was lowered. The horseman passed it, and disappeared under\r\nthe gloomy portal which was beyond it.\r\n\r\nGlendinning and his companion advancing more leisurely along the rugged\r\ncauseway, stood at length under the same gateway, over which frowned,\r\nin dark red freestone, the ancient armorial bearings of the house of\r\nAvenel, which represented a female figure shrouded and muffled, which\r\noccupied the whole field. The cause of their assuming so singular a\r\ndevice was uncertain, but the figure was generally supposed to represent\r\nthe mysterious being called the White Lady of Avenel. [Footnote: There\r\nis an ancient English family, I believe, which bears, or did bear, a\r\nghost or spirit passant sable in a field argent. This seems to have been\r\na device of a punning or _canting_ herald.] The sight of this mouldering\r\nshield awakened in the mind of Halbert the strange circumstances which\r\nhad connected his fate with that of Mary Avenel, and with the doings of\r\nthe spiritual being who was attached to her house, and whom he saw\r\nhere, represented in stone, as he had before seen her effigy upon\r\nthe seal-ring of Walter Avenel, which, with other trinkets formerly\r\nmentioned, had been saved from pillage, and brought to Glendearg, when\r\nMary\'s mother was driven from her habitation.\r\n\r\n"You sigh, my son," said the old man, observing the impression made on\r\nhis youthful companion\'s countenance, but mistaking the cause; "if you\r\nfear to enter, we may yet return."\r\n\r\n"That can ye not," said Christie of the Clinthill, who emerged at that\r\ninstant from the side-door under the archway. "Look yonder, and choose\r\nwhether you will return skimming the water like a wild-duck, or winging\r\nthe air like a plover."\r\n\r\nThey looked, and saw that the drawbridge which they had just crossed was\r\nagain raised, and now interposed its planks betwixt the setting sun and\r\nthe portal of the castle, deepening the gloom of the arch under which\r\nthey stood. Christie laughed and bid them follow him, saying, by way of\r\nencouragement, in Halbert\'s ear, "Answer boldly and readily to whatever\r\nthe Baron asks you. Never stop to pick your words, and above all show no\r\nfear of him--the devil is not so black as he is painted."\r\n\r\nAs he spoke thus, he introduced them into the large stone hall, at the\r\nupper end of which blazed a huge fire of wood. The long oaken table,\r\nwhich, as usual, occupied the midst of the apartment, was covered\r\nwith rude preparations for the evening meal of the Baron and his chief\r\ndomestics, five or six of whom, strong, athletic, savage-looking men,\r\npaced up and down the lower end of the hall, which rang to the jarring\r\nclang of their long swords that clashed as they moved, and to the heavy\r\ntramp of their high-heeled jack-boots. Iron jacks, or coats of buff,\r\nformed the principal part of their dress, and steel-bonnets, or large\r\nslouched hats with Spanish plumes drooping backwards, were their head\r\nattire.\r\n\r\nThe Baron of Avenel was one of those tall, muscular, martial figures,\r\nwhich are the favourite subjects of Salvator Rosa. He wore a cloak\r\nwhich had been once gaily trimmed, but which, by long wear and\r\nfrequent exposure to the weather, was now faded in its colours. Thrown\r\nnegligently about his tall person, it partly hid, and partly showed, a\r\nshort doublet of buff, under which was in some places visible that light\r\nshirt of mail which was called a _secret_, because worn instead of more\r\nostensible armour to protect against private assassination. A leathern\r\nbelt sustained a large and heavy sword on one side, and on the other\r\nthat gay poniard which had once called Sir Piercie Shafton master, of\r\nwhich the hatchments and gildings were already much defaced, either by\r\nrough usage or neglect.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the rudeness of his apparel, Julian Avenel\'s manner\r\nand countenance had far more elevation than those of the attendants\r\nwho surrounded him. He might be fifty or upwards, for his dark hair was\r\nmingled with gray, but age had neither tamed the fire of his eye nor the\r\nenterprise of his disposition. His countenance had been handsome, for\r\nbeauty was an attribute of the family; but the lines were roughened by\r\nfatigue and exposure to the weather, and rendered coarse by the habitual\r\nindulgence of violent passions.\r\n\r\nHe seemed in deep and moody reflection, and was pacing at a distance\r\nfrom his dependents along the upper end of the hall, sometimes stopping\r\nfrom time to time to caress and feed a gos-hawk, which sat upon his\r\nwrist, with its jesses (_i. e._ the leathern straps fixed to its legs)\r\nwrapt around his hand. The bird, which seemed not insensible to its\r\nmaster\'s attention, answered his caresses by ruffling forward its\r\nfeathers, and pecking playfully at his finger. At such intervals\r\nthe Baron smiled, but instantly resumed the darksome air of sullen\r\nmeditation. He did not even deign to look upon an object, which few\r\ncould have passed and repassed so often without bestowing on it a\r\ntransient glance.\r\n\r\nThis was a woman of exceeding beauty, rather gaily than richly attired,\r\nwho sat on a low seat close by the huge hall chimney. The gold chains\r\nround her neck and arms,--the gay gown of green which swept the\r\nfloor,--the silver embroidered girdle, with its bunch of keys, depending\r\nin house-wifely pride by a silver chain,--the yellow silken _couvrechef_\r\n(Scottice, _curch_) which was disposed around her head, and partly\r\nconcealed her dark profusion of hair,--above all, the circumstance so\r\ndelicately touched in the old ballad, that "the girdle was too short,"\r\nthe "gown of green all too strait," for the wearer\'s present shape,\r\nwould have intimated the Baron\'s lady. But then the lowly seat,--the\r\nexpression of deep melancholy, which was changed into a timid smile\r\nwhenever she saw the least chance of catching the eye of Julian\r\nAvenel,--the subdued look of grief, and the starting tear for which\r\nthat constrained smile was again exchanged when she saw herself entirely\r\ndisregarded,--these were not the attributes of a wife, or they were\r\nthose of a dejected and afflicted female, who had yielded her love on\r\nless than legitimate terms.\r\n\r\nJulian Avenel, as we have said, continued to pace the hall without\r\npaying any of that mute attention which is rendered to almost every\r\nfemale either by affection or courtesy. He seemed totally unconscious of\r\nher presence, or of that of his attendants, and was only roused from\r\nhis own dark reflections by the notice he paid to the falcon, to which,\r\nhowever, the lady seemed to attend, as if studying to find either\r\nan opportunity of speaking to the Baron, or of finding something\r\nenigmatical in the expressions which he used to the bird. All this the\r\nstrangers had time enough to remark; for no sooner had they entered the\r\napartment than their usher, Christie of the Clinthill, after exchanging\r\na significant glance with the menials or troopers at the lower end of\r\nthe apartment, signed to Halbert Glendinning and to his companion to\r\nstand still near the door, while he himself, advancing nearer the table,\r\nplaced himself in such a situation as to catch the Baron\'s observation\r\nwhen he should be disposed to look around, but without presuming to\r\nintrude himself on his master\'s notice. Indeed, the look of this man,\r\nnaturally bold, hardy, and audacious, seemed totally changed when he\r\nwas in presence of his master, and resembled the dejected and cowering\r\nmanner of a quarrelsome dog when rebuked by his owner, or when he finds\r\nhimself obliged to deprecate the violence of a superior adversary of his\r\nown species.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the novelty of his own situation, and every painful feeling\r\nconnected with it, Halbert felt his curiosity interested in the female,\r\nwho sate by the chimney unnoticed and unregarded. He marked with what\r\nkeen and trembling solicitude she watched the broken words of Julian,\r\nand how her glance stole towards him, ready to be averted upon the\r\nslightest chance of his perceiving himself to be watched.\r\n\r\nMeantime he went on with his dalliance with his feathered favourite, now\r\ngiving, now withholding, the morsel with which he was about to feed the\r\nbird, and so exciting its appetite and gratifying it by turns. "What!\r\nmore yet?--thou foul kite, thou wouldst never have done--give thee part\r\nthou wilt have all--Ay, prune thy feathers, and prink thyself gay--much\r\nthou wilt make of it now--dost think I know thee not?--dost think I see\r\nnot that all that ruffling and pluming of wing and feathers is not\r\nfor thy master, but to try what thou canst make of him, thou greedy\r\ngled?--well--there--take it then, and rejoice thyself--little boon goes\r\nfar with thee, and with all thy sex--and so it should."\r\n\r\nHe ceased to look on the bird, and again traversed the apartment. Then\r\ntaking another small piece of raw meat from the trencher, on which it\r\nwas placed ready cut for his use, he began once again to tempt and tease\r\nthe bird, by offering and withdrawing it, until he awakened its wild and\r\nbold disposition. "What! struggling, fluttering, aiming at me with beak\r\nand single? [Footnote: In the _kindly_ language of hawking, as Lady\r\nJuliana Berners terms it, hawks\' talons are called their _singles_]\r\nSo la! So la! wouldst mount? wouldst fly? the jesses are round thy\r\nclutches, fool--thou canst neither stir nor soar but by my will--Beware\r\nthou come to reclaim, wench, else I will wring thy head off one of these\r\ndays--Well, have it then, and well fare thou with it.--So ho, Jenkin!"\r\nOne of the attendants stepped forward--"Take the foul gled hence to\r\nthe mew--or, stay; leave her, but look well to her casting and to her\r\nbathing--we will see her fly to-morrow.--How now, Christie, so soon\r\nreturned?"\r\n\r\nChristie advanced to his master, and gave an account of himself and his\r\njourney, in the way in which a police-officer holds communication with\r\nhis magistrate, that is, as much by signs as by words.\r\n\r\n"Noble sir," said that worthy satellite, "the Laird of--," he named no\r\nplace, but pointed with his finger in a south-western direction,--\r\n"may not ride with you the day he purposed, because the Lord Warden has\r\nthreatened that he will--"\r\n\r\nHere another blank, intelligibly enough made up by the speaker touching\r\nhis own neck with his left fore-finger, and leaning his head a little to\r\none side.\r\n\r\n"Cowardly caitiff!" said Julian; "by Heaven! the whole world turns sheer\r\nnaught--it is not worth a brave man\'s living in--ye may ride a day and\r\nnight, and never see a feather wave or hear a horse prance--the spirit\r\nof our fathers is dead amongst us--the very brutes are degenerated--the\r\ncattle we bring at our life\'s risk are mere carrion--our hawks are\r\nriflers [Footnote: So called when they only caught their prey by the\r\nfeathers.]--our hounds are turnspits and trindle-tails--our men are\r\nwomen--and our women are--"\r\n\r\nHe looked at the female for the first time, and stopped short in\r\nthe midst of what he was about to say, though there was something so\r\ncontemptuous in the glance, that the blank might have been thus filled\r\nup--"Our women are such as she is."\r\n\r\nHe said it not, however, and as if desirous of attracting his attention\r\nat all risks, and in whatever manner, she rose and came forward to him,\r\nbut with a timorousness ill-disguised by affected gaiety.--"Our women,\r\nJulian--what would you say of the women?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing," answered Julian Avenel, "at least nothing but that they are\r\nkind-hearted wenches like thyself, Kate." The female coloured deeply,\r\nand returned to her seat.--"And what strangers hast thou brought with\r\nthee, Christie, that stand yonder like two stone statues?" said the\r\nBaron.\r\n\r\n"The taller," answered Christie, "is, so please you, a young fellow\r\ncalled Halbert Glendinning, the eldest son of the old widow at\r\nGlendearg."\r\n\r\n"What brings him here?" said the Baron; "hath he any message from Mary\r\nAvenel?"\r\n\r\n"Not as I think," said Christie; "the youth is roving the country--he\r\nwas always a wild slip, for I have known him since he was the height of\r\nmy sword."\r\n\r\n"What qualities hath he?" said the Baron.\r\n\r\n"All manner of qualities," answered his follower--"he can strike a buck,\r\ntrack a deer, fly a hawk, halloo to a hound--he shoots in the long\r\nand crossbow to a hair\'s breadth--wields a lance or sword like myself\r\nnearly--backs a horse manfully and fairly--I wot not what more a man\r\nneed to do to make him a gallant companion."\r\n\r\n"And who," said the Baron, "is the old miser [Footnote: Miser, used in\r\nthe sense in which it often occurs in Spenser, and which is indeed its\r\nliteral import--"wretched old man."] who stands beside him?"\r\n\r\n"Some cast of a priest as I fancy--he says he is charged with letters to\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Bid them come forward," said the Baron; and no sooner had they\r\napproached him more nearly, than, struck by the fine form and strength\r\ndisplayed by Halbert Glendinning, he addressed him thus: "I am told,\r\nyoung Swankie, that you are roaming the world to seek your fortune,--if\r\nyou will serve Julian Avenel, you may find it without going farther."\r\n\r\n"So please you," answered Glendinning, "something has chanced to me that\r\nmakes it better I should leave this land, and I am bound for Edinburgh."\r\n\r\n"What!--thou hast stricken some of the king\'s deer, I warrant,--or\r\nlightened the meadows of Saint Mary\'s of some of their beeves--or thou\r\nhast taken a moonlight leap over the border?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir," said Halbert, "my case is entirely different."\r\n\r\n"Then I warrant thee," said the Baron, "thou hast stabbed some brother\r\nchurl in a fray about a wench--thou art a likely lad to wrangle in such\r\na cause."\r\n\r\nIneffably disgusted at his tone and manner, Halbert Glendinning remained\r\nsilent, while the thought darted across his mind, what would Julian\r\nAvenel have said, had he known the quarrel of which he spoke so lightly,\r\nhad arisen on account of his own brother\'s daughter! "But be thy cause\r\nof flight what it will," said Julian, in continuation, "dost thou think\r\nthe law or its emissaries can follow thee into this island, or arrest\r\nthee under the standard of Avenel?--Look at the depth of the lake, the\r\nstrength of the walls, the length of the causeway--look at my men,\r\nand think if they are likely to see a comrade injured, or if I, their\r\nmaster, am a man to desert a faithful follower, in good or evil. I tell\r\nthee it shall be an eternal day of truce betwixt thee and justice,\r\nas they call it, from the instant thou hast put my colours into thy\r\ncap--thou shalt ride by the Warden\'s nose as thou wouldst pass an old\r\nmarket-woman, and ne\'er a cur which follows him shall dare to bay at\r\nthee!"\r\n\r\n"I thank you for your offers, noble sir," replied Halbert, "but I must\r\nanswer in brief, that I cannot profit by them--my fortunes lead me\r\nelsewhere."\r\n\r\n"Thou art a self-willed fool for thy pains," said Julian, turning from\r\nhim; and signing Christie to approach, he whispered in his ear, "there\r\nis promise in that young fellow\'s looks, Christie, and we want men of\r\nlimbs and sinews so compacted--those thou hast brought to me of late are\r\nthe mere refuse of mankind, wretches scarce worth the arrow that ends\r\nthem: this youngster is limbed like Saint George. Ply him with wine and\r\nwassail--let the wenches weave their meshes about him like spiders--thou\r\nunderstandest?" Christie gave a sagacious nod of intelligence, and fell\r\nback to a respectful distance from his master.--"And thou, old man,"\r\nsaid the Baron, turning to the elder traveller, "hast thou been roaming\r\nthe world after fortune too?--it seems not she has fallen into thy way."\r\n\r\n"So please you," replied Warden, "I were perhaps more to be pitied than\r\nI am now, had I indeed met with that fortune, which, like others, I have\r\nsought in my greener days."\r\n\r\n"Nay, understand me, friend," said the Baron; "if thou art satisfied\r\nwith thy buckram gown and long staff, I also am well content thou\r\nshouldst be as poor and contemptible as is good for the health of thy\r\nbody and soul--All I care to know of thee is, the cause which hath\r\nbrought thee to my castle, where few crows of thy kind care to settle.\r\nThou art, I warrant thee, some ejected monk of a suppressed convent,\r\npaying in his old days the price of the luxurious idleness in which he\r\nspent his youth.--Ay, or it may be some pilgrim with a budget of lies\r\nfrom Saint James of Compostella, or Our Lady of Loretto; or thou mayest\r\nbe some pardoner with his budget of relics from Rome, forgiving sins at\r\na penny a-dozen, and one to the tale.--Ay, I guess why I find thee in\r\nthis boy\'s company, and doubtless thou wouldst have such a strapping lad\r\nas he to carry thy wallet, and relieve thy lazy shoulders; but by the\r\nmass I will cross thy cunning. I make my vow to sun and moon, I will\r\nnot see a proper lad so misleard as to run the country with an old knave\r\nlike Simmie and his brother. [Footnote: Two _quaestionarii_, or begging\r\nfriars, whose accoutrements and roguery make the subject of an old\r\nScottish satirical poem] Away with thee!" he added, rising in wrath,\r\nand speaking so fast as to give no opportunity of answer, being probably\r\ndetermined to terrify the elder guest into an abrupt flight--"Away with\r\nthee, with thy clouted coat, scrip, and scallop-shell, or, by the name\r\nof Avenel, I will have them loose the hounds on thee."\r\n\r\nWarden waited with the greatest patience until Julian Avenel, astonished\r\nthat the threats and violence of his language made no impression on him,\r\npaused in a sort of wonder, and said in a less imperious tone, "Why the\r\nfiend dost thou not answer me?"\r\n\r\n"When you have done speaking," said Warden, in the same composed manner,\r\n"it will be full time to reply."\r\n\r\n"Say on man, in the devil\'s name--but take heed--beg not here--were it\r\nbut for the rinds of cheese, the refuse of the rats, or a morsel that my\r\ndogs would turn from--neither a grain of meal, nor the nineteenth part\r\nof a gray groat, will I give to any feigned limmer of thy coat."\r\n\r\n"It may be," answered Warden, "that you would have less quarrel with my\r\ncoat if you knew what it covers, I am neither a friar nor mendicant, and\r\nwould be right glad to hear thy testimony against these foul deceivers\r\nof God\'s church, and usurpers of his rights over the Christian flock,\r\nwere it given in Christian charity."\r\n\r\n"And who or what art thou, then," said Avenel, "that thou comest to this\r\nBorder land, and art neither monk, nor soldier, nor broken man?"\r\n\r\n"I am an humble teacher of the holy word," answered Warden. "This letter\r\nfrom a most noble person will speak why I am here at this present time."\r\n\r\nHe delivered the letter to the Baron, who regarded the seal with some\r\nsurprise, and then looked on the letter itself, which seemed to excite\r\nstill more. He then fixed his eyes on the stranger, and said, in a\r\nmenacing tone, "I think thou darest not betray me or deceive me?"\r\n\r\n"I am not the man to attempt either," was the concise reply.\r\n\r\nJulian Avenel carried the letter to the window, where he perused, or\r\nat least attempted to peruse it more than once, often looking from the\r\npaper and gazing on the stranger who had delivered it, as if he meant to\r\nread the purport of the missive in the face of the messenger. Julian\r\nat length called to the female,--"Catherine, bestir thee, and fetch\r\nme presently that letter which I bade thee keep ready at hand in thy\r\ncasket, having no sure lockfast place of my own."\r\n\r\nCatherine went with the readiness of one willing to be employed; and\r\nas she walked, the situation which requires a wider gown and a longer\r\ngirdle, and in which woman claims from man a double portion of the most\r\nanxious care, was still more visible than before. She soon returned with\r\nthe paper, and was rewarded with a cold--"I thank thee, wench; thou art\r\na careful secretary."\r\n\r\nThis second paper he also perused and reperused more than once, and\r\nstill, as he read it, bent from time to time a wary and observant eye\r\nupon Henry Warden. This examination and re-examination, though both the\r\nman and the place were dangerous, the preacher endured with the most\r\ncomposed and steady countenance, seeming, under the eagle, or rather the\r\nvulture eye of the baron, as unmoved as under the gaze of an ordinary\r\nand peaceful peasant. At length Julian Avenel folded both papers, and\r\nhaving put them into the pocket of his cloak, cleared his brow, and,\r\ncoming forward, addressed his female companion. "Catherine," said he,\r\n"I have done this good man injustice, when I mistook him for one of the\r\ndrones of Rome. He is a preacher, Catherine--a preacher of the--the new\r\ndoctrine of the Lords of the Congregation."\r\n\r\n"The doctrine of the blessed Scriptures," said the preacher, "purified\r\nfrom the devices of men."\r\n\r\n"Sayest thou?" said Julian Avenel--"Well, thou mayest call it what thou\r\nlists; but to me it is recommended, because it flings off all those\r\nsottish dreams about saints and angels and devils, and unhorses lazy\r\nmonks that have ridden us so long, and spur-galled us so hard. No\r\nmore masses and corpse-gifts--no more tithes and offerings to make men\r\npoor--no more prayers or psalms to make men cowards-no more christenings\r\nand penances, and confessions and marriages."\r\n\r\n"So please you," said Henry Warden, "it is against the corruptions, not\r\nagainst the fundamental doctrines, of the church, which we desire to\r\nrenovate, and not to abolish."\r\n\r\n"Prithee, peace, man," said the Baron; "we of the laity care not what\r\nyou set up, so you pull merrily down what stands in our way. Specially\r\nit suits well with us of the Southland fells; for it is our profession\r\nto turn the world upside down, and we live ever the blithest life when\r\nthe downer side is uppermost."\r\n\r\nWarden would have replied; but the Baron allowed him not time, striking\r\nthe table with the hilt of his dagger, and crying out,--"Ha! you\r\nloitering knaves, bring our supper-meal quickly. See you not this holy\r\nman is exhausted for lack of food? heard ye ever of priest or preacher\r\nthat devoured not his five meals a-day?"\r\n\r\nThe attendants bustled to and fro, and speedily brought in several large\r\nsmoking platters filled with huge pieces of beef, boiled and roasted,\r\nbut without any variety whatsoever; without vegetables, and almost\r\nwithout bread, though there was at the upper end a few oat-cakes in a\r\nbasket. Julian Avenel made a sort of apology to Warden.\r\n\r\n"You have been commended to our care, Sir Preacher, since that is your\r\nstyle, by a person whom we highly honour."\r\n\r\n"I am assured," said Warden, "that the most noble Lord--"\r\n\r\n"Prithee, peace, man," said Avenel; "what need of naming names, so we\r\nunderstand each other? I meant but to speak in reference to your safety\r\nand comfort, of which he desires us to be chary. Now, for your safety,\r\nlook at my walls and water. But touching your comfort, we have no\r\ncorn of our own, and the meal-girnels of the south are less easily\r\ntransported than their beeves, seeing they have no legs to walk upon.\r\nBut what though? a stoup of wine thou shalt have, and of the best--thou\r\nshalt sit betwixt Catherine and me at the board-end.--And, Christie, do\r\nthou look to the young springald, and call to the cellarer for a flagon\r\nof the best."\r\n\r\nThe Baron took his wonted place at the upper end of the board; his\r\nCatherine sate down, and courteously pointed to a seat betwixt them for\r\ntheir reverend guest. But notwithstanding the influence both of hunger\r\nand fatigue, Henry Warden retained his standing posture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter the Twenty-Fifth.\r\n\r\n\r\n  When lovely woman stoops to folly,\r\n  And finds too late that men betray--\r\n\r\nJulian Avenel saw with surprise the demeanour of the reverend stranger.\r\n"Beshrew me," he said, "these new-fashioned religioners have fast-days,\r\nI warrant me--the old ones used to confer these blessings chiefly on the\r\nlaity."\r\n\r\n"We acknowledge no such rule," said the preacher--"We hold that our\r\nfaith consists not in using or abstaining from special meats on special\r\ndays; and in fasting we rend our hearts, and not our garments."\r\n\r\n"The better--the better for yourselves, and the worse for Tom Tailor,"\r\nsaid the Baron; "but come, sit down, or, if thou needs must e\'en give us\r\na cast of thy office, mutter thy charm."\r\n\r\n"Sir Baron," said the preacher, "I am in a strange land, where neither\r\nmine office nor my doctrine are known, and where, it would seem, both\r\nare greatly misunderstood. It is my duty so to bear me, that in my\r\nperson, however unworthy, my Master\'s dignity may be respected, and that\r\nsin may take not confidence from relaxation of the bonds of discipline."\r\n\r\n"Ho la! halt there," said the Baron; "thou wert sent hither for thy\r\nsafety, but not, I think, to preach to me, or control me. What is it\r\nthou wouldst have, Sir Preacher? Remember thou speakest to one somewhat\r\nshort of patience, who loves a short health and a long draught."\r\n\r\n"In a word, then," said Henry Warden, "that lady--"\r\n\r\n"How?" said the Baron, starting--"what of her?--what hast thou to say of\r\nthat dame?"\r\n\r\n"Is she thy house-dame?" said the preacher, after a moment\'s pause, in\r\nwhich, he seemed to seek for the best mode of expressing what he had to\r\nsay--"Is she, in brief, thy wife?"\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate young woman pressed both her hands on her face, as if\r\nto hide it, but the deep blush which crimsoned her brow and neck, showed\r\nthat her cheeks were also glowing; and the bursting tears, which found\r\ntheir way betwixt her slender fingers, bore witness to her sorrow, as\r\nwell as to her shame.\r\n\r\n"Now, by my father\'s ashes!" said the Baron, rising and spurning from\r\nhim his footstool with such violence, that it hit the wall on the\r\nopposite side of the apartment--then instantly constraining himself,\r\nhe muttered, "What need to run myself into trouble for a fool\'s\r\nword?"--then resuming his seat, he answered coldly and scornfully--"No,\r\nSir Priest or Sir Preacher, Catherine is not my wife--Cease thy\r\nwhimpering, thou foolish wench--she is not my wife, but she is\r\nhandfasted with me, and that makes her as honest a woman."\r\n\r\n"Handfasted?"--repeated Warden.\r\n\r\n"Knowest thou not that rite, holy man?" said Avenel, in the same tone of\r\nderision; "then I will tell thee. We Border-men are more wary than\r\nyour inland clowns of Fife and Lothian--no jump in the dark for us--no\r\nclenching the fetters around our wrists till we know how they will wear\r\nwith us--we take our wives, like our horses, upon trial. When we are\r\nhandfasted, as we term it, we are man and wife for a year and day--that\r\nspace gone by, each may choose another mate, or, at their pleasure, may\r\ncall the priest to marry them for life--and this we call handfasting."\r\n[Footnote: This custom of handfasting actually prevailed in the upland\r\ndays. It arose partly from the want of priests. While the convents\r\nsubsisted, monks were detached on regular circuits through the wilder\r\ndistricts, to marry those who had lived in this species of connexion. A\r\npractice of the same kind existed in the Isle of Portland.]\r\n\r\n"Then," said the preacher, "I tell thee, noble Baron, in brotherly love\r\nto thy soul, it is a custom licentious, gross, and corrupted, and, if\r\npersisted in, dangerous, yea, damnable. It binds thee to the frailer\r\nbeing while she is the object of desire--it relieves thee when she is\r\nmost the subject of pity--it gives all to brutal sense, and nothing to\r\ngenerous and gentle affection. I say to thee, that he who can meditate\r\nthe breach of such an engagement, abandoning the deluded woman and the\r\nhelpless offspring, is worse than the birds of prey; for of them the\r\nmales remain with their mates until the nestlings can take wing. Above\r\nall, I say it is contrary to the pure Christian doctrine, which assigns\r\nwoman to man as the partner of his labour, the soother of his evil,\r\nhis helpmate in peril, his friend in affliction; not as the toy of his\r\nlooser hours, or as a flower, which, once cropped, he may throw aside at\r\npleasure."\r\n\r\n"Now, by the Saints, a most virtuous homily!" said the Baron; "quaintly\r\nconceived and curiously pronounced, and to a well-chosen congregation.\r\nHark ye, Sir Gospeller! trow ye to have a fool in hand? Know I not that\r\nyour sect rose by bluff Harry Tudor, merely because ye aided him to\r\nchange _his_ Kate; and wherefore should I not use the same Christian\r\nliberty with _mine?_ Tush, man! bless the good food, and meddle not with\r\nwhat concerns thee not--thou hast no gull in Julian Avenel."\r\n\r\n"He hath gulled and cheated himself," said the preacher, "should he\r\neven incline to do that poor sharer of his domestic cares the imperfect\r\njustice that remains to him. Can he now raise her to the rank of a pure\r\nand uncontaminated matron?--Can he deprive his child of the misery of\r\nowing birth to a mother who has erred? He can indeed give them both\r\nthe rank, the state of married wife and of lawful son; but, in public\r\nopinion, their names will be smirched and sullied with a stain which his\r\ntardy efforts cannot entirely efface. Yet render it to them, Baron of\r\nAvenel, render to them this late and imperfect justice. Bid me bind\r\nyou together for ever, and celebrate the day of your bridal, not with\r\nfeasting or wassail, but with sorrow for past sin, and the resolution\r\nto commence a better life. Happy then will have the chance been that has\r\ndrawn me to this castle, though I come driven by calamity, and unknowing\r\nwhere my course is bound, like a leaf travelling on the north wind."\r\n\r\nThe plain, and even coarse features, of the zealous speaker, were warmed\r\nat once and ennobled by the dignity of his enthusiasm; and the wild\r\nBaron, lawless as he was, and accustomed to spurn at the control whether\r\nof religious or moral law, felt, for the first time perhaps in his life,\r\nthat he was under subjection to a mind superior to his own. He sat mute\r\nand suspended in his deliberations, hesitating betwixt anger and shame,\r\nyet borne down by the weight of the just rebuke thus boldly fulminated\r\nagainst him.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate young woman, conceiving hopes from her tyrant\'s silence\r\nand apparent indecision, forgot both her fear and shame in her timid\r\nexpectation that Avenel would relent; and fixing upon him her anxious\r\nand beseeching eyes, gradually drew near and nearer to his seat, till at\r\nlength, laying a trembling hand on his cloak, she ventured to utter, "O\r\nnoble Julian, listen to the good man!"\r\n\r\nThe speech and the motion were ill-timed, and wrought on that proud and\r\nwayward spirit the reverse of her wishes.\r\n\r\nThe fierce Baron started up in a fury, exclaiming, "What! thou foolish\r\ncallet, art thou confederate with this strolling vagabond, whom thou\r\nhast seen beard me in my own hall! Hence with thee, and think that I ana\r\nproof both to male and female hypocrisy!"\r\n\r\nThe poor girl started back, astounded at his voice of thunder and looks\r\nof fury, and, turning pale as death, endeavoured to obey his orders, and\r\ntottered towards the door. Her limbs failed in the attempt, and she fell\r\non the stone floor in a manner which her situation might have rendered\r\nfatal--The blood gushed from her face.--Halbert Glendinning brooked not\r\na sight so brutal, but, uttering a deep imprecation, started from\r\nhis seat, and laid his hand on his sword, under the strong impulse of\r\npassing it through the body of the cruel and hard-hearted ruffian. But\r\nChristie of the Clinthill, guessing his intention, threw his arms around\r\nhim, and prevented him from stirring to execute his purpose.\r\n\r\nThe impulse to such an act of violence was indeed but momentary, as it\r\ninstantly appeared that Avenel himself, shocked at the effects of his\r\nviolence, was lifting up and endeavouring to soothe in his own way the\r\nterrified Catherine.\r\n\r\n"Peace," he said, "prithee, peace, thou silly minion--why, Kate, though\r\nI listen not to this tramping preacher, I said not what might happen\r\nan thou dost bear me a stout boy. There--there--dry thy tears--Call thy\r\nwomen.--So ho!--where be these queans?--Christie--Rowley--Hutcheon--drag\r\nthem hither by the hair of the head!"\r\n\r\nA half dozen of startled wild-looking females rushed into the room,\r\nand bore out her who might be either termed their mistress or their\r\ncompanion. She showed little sign of life, except by groaning faintly\r\nand keeping her hand on her side.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had this luckless female been conveyed from the apartment,\r\nthan the Baron, advancing to the table, filled and drank a deep goblet\r\nof wine; then, putting an obvious restraint on his passions, turned to\r\nthe preacher, who stood horror-struck at the scene he had witnessed, and\r\nsaid, "You have borne too hard on us, Sir Preacher--but coming with the\r\ncommendations which you have brought me, I doubt not but your meaning\r\nwas good. But we are a wilder folk than you inland men of Fife and\r\nLothian. Be advised, therefore, by me--Spur not an unbroken horse--put\r\nnot your ploughshare too deep into new land--Preach to us spiritual\r\nliberty, and we will hearken to you.--But we will give no way to\r\nspiritual bondage.--Sit, therefore, down, and pledge me in old sack, and\r\nwe will talk over these matters."\r\n\r\n"It is _from_ spiritual bondage," said the preacher, in the same tone\r\nof admonitory reproof, "that I came to deliver you--it is from a bondage\r\nmore fearful than than that of the heaviest earthly gyves--it is from\r\nyour own evil passions."\r\n\r\n"Sit down," said Avenel, fiercely; "sit down while the play is\r\ngood--else by my father\'s crest and my mother\'s honour!----"\r\n\r\n"Now," whispered Christie of the Clinthill to Halbert, "if he refuse to\r\nsit down, I would not give a gray groat for his head."\r\n\r\n"Lord Baron," said Warden, "thou hast placed me in extremity. But if the\r\nquestion be, whether I am to hide the light which I am commanded to show\r\nforth, or to lose the light of this world, my choice is made. I say to\r\nthee, like the Holy Baptist to Herod, it is not lawful for thee to have\r\nthis woman; and I say it though bonds and death be the consequence,\r\ncounting my life as nothing in comparison of the ministry to which I am\r\ncalled."\r\n\r\nJulian Avenel, enraged at the firmness of this reply, flung from his\r\nright hand the cup in which he was about to drink to his guest, and from\r\nthe other cast off the hawk, which flew wildly through the apartment.\r\nHis first motion was to lay hand upon his dagger. But, changing\r\nhis resolution, he exclaimed, "To the dungeon with this insolent\r\nstroller!--I will hear no man speak a word for him----Look to the\r\nfalcon, Christie, thou fool--an she escape, I will despatch you after\r\nher every man--Away with that hypocritical dreamer--drag him hence if he\r\nresist!"\r\n\r\nHe was obeyed in both points. Christie of the Clinthill arrested the\r\nhawk\'s flight, by putting his foot on her jesses, and so holding her\r\nfast, while Henry Warden was led off, without having shown the slightest\r\nsymptoms of terror, by two of the Baron\'s satellites. Julian Avenel\r\nwalked the apartment for a short time in sullen silence, and despatching\r\none of his attendants with a whispered message, which probably related\r\nto the health of the unfortunate Catherine, he said aloud, "These rash\r\nand meddling priests--By Heaven! they make us worse than we would be\r\nwithout them."\r\n\r\n[Footnote: If it were necessary to name a prototype for this brutal,\r\nlicentious and cruel Border chief, in an age which showed but too many\r\nsuch, the Laird of Black Ormiston might be selected for that purpose. He\r\nwas a friend and confidant of Bothwell, and an agent in Henry Darnley\'s\r\nmurder. At his last stage, he was, like other great offenders, a seeming\r\npenitent; and, as his confession bears, divers gentlemen and servants\r\nbeing in the chamber, he said, "For God\'s sake, sit down and pray for\r\nme, for I have been a great sinner otherwise," (that is, besides his\r\nshare in Darnley\'s death,) "for the which God is this day punishing me;\r\nfor of all men on the earth, I have been one of the proudest, and most\r\nhigh-minded, and most unclean of my body. But specially I have shed the\r\ninnocent blood of one Michael Hunter with my own hands. Alas, therefore!\r\nbecause the said Michael, having me lying on my back, having a fork in\r\nhis hand, might have slain me if he had pleased, and did it not, which\r\nof all things grieves me most in conscience. Also, in a rage, I hanged a\r\npoor man for a horse;--with many other wicked deeds, for whilk I ask my\r\nGod mercy. It is not marvel I have been wicked, considering the wicked\r\ncompany that ever I have been in, but specially within the seven years\r\nby-past, in which I never saw two good men or one good deed, but all\r\nkind of wickedness, and yet God would not suffer me to be lost."--See\r\nthe whole confession in the State Trials.\r\n\r\nAnother worthy of the Borders, called Geordy Bourne, of somewhat\r\nsubordinate rank, was a similar picture of profligacy. He had fallen\r\ninto the hands of Sir Robert Carey, then Warden of the English East\r\nMarches, who gives the following account of his prisoner\'s confession:--\r\n\r\n"When all things were quiet, and the watch set at night, after supper,\r\nabout ten of the clock, I took one of my men\'s liveries, and put it\r\nabout me, and took two other of my servants with me in their liveries;\r\nand we three, as the Warden\'s men, came to the Provost Marshal\'s where\r\nBourne was, and were let into his chamber. We sate down by him, and told\r\nhim that we were desirous to see him, because we heard he was stout and\r\nvaliant, and true to his friend, and that we were sorry our master could\r\nnot be moved to save his life. He voluntarily of himself said, that he\r\nhad lived long enough to do so many villanies as he had done; and withal\r\ntold us, that he had lain with above forty men\'s wives, what in England\r\nwhat in Scotland; and that he had killed seven Englishmen with his own\r\nhands, cruelly murdering them; and that he had spent his whole time\r\nin whoring, drinking, stealing, and taking deep revenge for slight\r\noffences. He seemed to be very penitent, and much desired a minister\r\nfor the comfort of his soul. We promised him to let our master know his\r\ndesire, who, we knew would promptly grant it. We took leave of him; and\r\npresently I took order that Mr Selby, a very honest preacher, should go\r\nto him, and not stir from him till his execution the next morning;\r\nfor after I had heard his own confession, I was resolved no conditions\r\nshould save his life, and so took order, that at the gates opening the\r\nnext morning, he should be carried to execution, which accordingly was\r\nperformed."--_Memoirs of Sir Robert Carey, Earl of Monmouth._]\r\n\r\nThe answer which he presently received seemed somewhat to pacify his\r\nangry mood, and he took his place at the board, commanding his retinue\r\nto the like. All sat down in silence, and began the repast.\r\n\r\nDuring the meal Christie in vain attempted to engage his youthful\r\ncompanion in carousal, or, at least, in conversation. Halbert\r\nGlendinning pleaded fatigue, and expressed himself unwilling to take any\r\nliquor stronger than the heather ale, which was at that time frequently\r\nused at meals. Thus every effort at jovialty died away, until the\r\nBaron, striking his hand against the table, as if impatient of the\r\nlong unbroken silence, cried out aloud, "What, ho! my masters--are ye\r\nBorder-riders, and sit as mute over your meal as a mess of monks and\r\nfriars?--Some one sing, if no one list to speak. Much eaten without\r\neither mirth or music is ill of digestion.--Louis," he added, speaking\r\nto one of the youngest of his followers, "thou art ready enough to sing\r\nwhen no one bids thee."\r\n\r\nThe young man looked first at his master, then up to the arched roof of\r\nthe hall, then drank off the horn of ale, or wine, which stood beside\r\nhim, and with a rough, yet not unmelodious voice, sung the following\r\nditty to the ancient air of "Blue bonnets over the Border."\r\n\r\n                 I.\r\n\r\n  March, march, Ettrick and Teviotdale,\r\n    Why the deil dinna ye march forward in order?\r\n  March, march, Eskdale and Liddesdale,\r\n    All the Blue Bonnets are bound for the Border\r\n        Many a banner spread,\r\n        Flutters above your head,\r\n    Many a crest that is famous in story;\r\n        Mount and make ready then,\r\n        Sons of the mountain glen,\r\n    Fight for the Queen and the old Scottish glory!\r\n\r\n                 II.\r\n\r\n  Come from the hills where the hirsels are grazing,\r\n    Come from the glen of the buck and the roe;\r\n  Come to the crag where the beacon is blazing,\r\n    Come with the buckler, the lance, and the bow.\r\n        Trumpets are sounding,\r\n        War-steeds are bounding,\r\n    Stand to your arms then, and march in good order;\r\n        England shall many a day\r\n        Tell of the bloody fray,\r\n    When the Blue Bonnets came over the Border!\r\n\r\nThe song, rude as it was, had in it that warlike character which at any\r\nother time would have roused Halbert\'s spirit; but at present the charm\r\nof minstrelsy had no effect upon him. He made it his request to Christie\r\nto suffer him to retire to rest, a request with which that worthy\r\nperson, seeing no chance of making a favourable impression on his\r\nintended proselyte in his present humour, was at length pleased to\r\ncomply. But no Sergeant Kite, who ever practised the profession of\r\nrecruiting, was more attentive that his object should not escape\r\nhim, than was Christie of the Clinthill. He indeed conducted Halbert\r\nGlendinning to a small apartment overlooking the lake, which was\r\naccommodated with a truckle bed. But before quitting him, Christie took\r\nspecial care to give a look to the bars which crossed the outside of the\r\nwindow, and when he left the apartment, he failed not to give the key a\r\ndouble turn; circumstances which convinced young Glendinning that there\r\nwas no intention of suffering him to depart from the Castle of Avenel\r\nat his own time and pleasure. He judged it, however, most prudent to let\r\nthese alarming symptoms pass without observation.\r\n\r\nNo sooner did he find himself in undisturbed solitude, than he ran\r\nrapidly over the events of the day in his recollection, and to his\r\nsurprise found that his own precarious fate, and even the death of\r\nPiercie Shafton, made less impression on him than the singularly bold\r\nand determined conduct of his companion, Henry Warden. Providence, which\r\nsuits its instruments to the end they are to achieve, had awakened in\r\nthe cause of Reformation in Scotland, a body of preachers of more energy\r\nthan refinement, bold in spirit, and strong in faith, contemners of\r\nwhatever stood betwixt them and their principal object, and seeking the\r\nadvancement of the great cause in which they laboured by the roughest\r\nroad, provided it were the shortest. The soft breeze may wave the\r\nwillow, but it requires the voice of the tempest to agitate the boughs\r\nof the oak; and, accordingly, to milder hearers, and in a less rude\r\nage, their manners would have been ill-adapted, but they were singularly\r\nsuccessful in their mission to the rude people to whom it was addressed.\r\n\r\nOwing to these reasons, Halbert Glendinning, who had resisted and\r\nrepelled the arguments of the preacher, was forcibly struck by the\r\nfirmness of his demeanour in the dispute with Julian Avenel. It might\r\nbe discourteous, and most certainly it was incautious, to choose such\r\na place and such an audience, for upbraiding with his transgressions\r\na baron, whom both manners and situation placed in full possession of\r\nindependent power. But the conduct of the preacher was uncompromising,\r\nfirm, manly, and obviously grounded upon the deepest conviction which\r\nduty and principle could afford; and Glendinning, who had viewed the\r\nconduct of Avenel with the deepest abhorrence, was proportionally\r\ninterested in the brave old man, who had ventured life rather than\r\nwithhold the censure due to guilt. This pitch of virtue seemed to him to\r\nbe in religion what was demanded by chivalry of her votaries in war; an\r\nabsolute surrender of all selfish feelings, and a combination of every\r\nenergy proper to the human mind, to discharge the task which duty\r\ndemanded.\r\n\r\nHalbert was at the period when youth was most open to generous emotions,\r\nand knows best how to appreciate them in others, and he felt, although\r\nhe hardly knew why, that, whether catholic or heretic, the safety of\r\nthis man deeply interested him. Curiosity mingled with the feeling, and\r\nled him to wonder what the nature of those doctrines could be, which\r\nstole their votary so completely from himself, and devoted him to chains\r\nor to death as their sworn champion. He had indeed been told of saints\r\nand martyrs of former days, who had braved for their religious faith\r\nthe extremity of death and torture. But their spirit of enthusiastic\r\ndevotion had long slept in the ease and indolent habits of their\r\nsuccessors, and their adventures, like those of knights-errant, were\r\nrather read for amusement than for edification. A new impulse had been\r\nnecessary to rekindle the energies of religious zeal, and that impulse\r\nwas now operating in favour of a purer religion, with one of whose\r\nsteadiest votaries the youth had now met for the first time.\r\n\r\nThe sense that he himself was a prisoner, under the power of this savage\r\nchieftain, by no means diminished Halbert\'s interest in the fate of his\r\nfellow sufferer, while he determined at the same time so far to emulate\r\nhis fortitude, that neither threats nor suffering should compel him to\r\nenter into the service of such a master. The possibility of escape next\r\noccurred to him, and though with little hope of effecting it in that\r\nway, Glendinning proceeded to examine more particularly the window of\r\nthe apartment. The apartment was situated in the first story of the\r\ncastle; and was not so far from the rock, on which it was founded, but\r\nthat an active and bold man might with little assistance descend to a\r\nshelf of rock which was immediately below the window, and from thence\r\neither leap or drop himself down into the lake which lay before his eye,\r\nclear and blue in the placid light of a full summer\'s moon.--"Were I\r\nonce placed on that ledge," thought Glendinning, "Julian Avenel and\r\nChristie had seen the last of me." The size of the window favoured\r\nsuch an attempt, but the stanchions or iron bars seemed to form an\r\ninsurmountable obstacle.\r\n\r\nWhile Halbert Glendinning gazed from the window with that eagerness\r\nof hope which was prompted by the energy of his character and his\r\ndetermination not to yield to circumstances, his ear caught some sounds\r\nfrom below, and listening with more attention, he could distinguish\r\nthe voice of the preacher engaged in his solitary devotions. To open a\r\ncorrespondence with him became immediately his object, and failing to\r\ndo so by less marked sounds, he at length ventured to speak, and was\r\nanswered from beneath--"Is it thou, my son?" The voice of the prisoner\r\nnow sounded more distinctly than when it was first heard, for Warden had\r\napproached the small aperture, which, serving his prison for a window,\r\nopened just betwixt the wall and the rock, and admitted a scanty portion\r\nof light through a wall of immense thickness. This _soupirait_ being\r\nplaced exactly under Halbert\'s window, the contiguity permitted the\r\nprisoners to converse in a low tone, when Halbert declared his intention\r\nto escape, and the possibility he saw of achieving his purpose, but for\r\nthe iron stanchions of the window--"Prove thy strength, my son, in the\r\nname of God" said the preacher. Halbert obeyed him more in despair than\r\nhope, but to his great astonishment, and somewhat to his terror, the bar\r\nparted asunder near the bottom, and the longer part being easily bent\r\noutwards, and not secured with lead in the upper socket, dropt out into\r\nHalbert\'s hand. He immediately whispered, but as energetically as a\r\nwhisper could be expressed--"By Heaven, the bar has given way in my\r\nhand!"\r\n\r\n"Thank Heaven, my son, instead of swearing by it," answered Warden from\r\nhis dungeon.\r\n\r\nWith little effort Halbert Glendinning forced himself through the\r\nopening thus wonderfully effected, and using his leathern sword-belt as\r\na rope to assist him, let himself safely drop on the shelf of rock upon\r\nwhich the preacher\'s window opened. But through this no passage could\r\nbe effected, being scarce larger than a loop-hole for musketry, and\r\napparently constructed for that purpose.\r\n\r\n"Are there no means by which I can assist your escape, my father?" said\r\nHalbert.\r\n\r\n"There are none, my son," answered the preacher; "but if thou wilt\r\nensure my safety, that may be in thy power."\r\n\r\n"I will labour earnestly for it," said the youth.\r\n\r\n"Take then a letter which I will presently write, for I have the means\r\nof light and writing materials in my scrip--Hasten towards Edinburgh,\r\nand on the way thou wilt meet a body of horse marching southwards--Give\r\nthis to their leader, and acquaint him of the state in which thou hast\r\nleft me. It may hap that thy doing so will advantage thyself."\r\n\r\nIn a minute or two the light of a taper gleamed through the shot-hole,\r\nand very shortly after, the preacher, with the assistance of his staff,\r\npushed a billet to Glendinning through the window.\r\n\r\n"God bless thee, my son," said the old man, "and complete the marvellous\r\nwork which he has begun."\r\n\r\n"Amen!" answered Halbert, with solemnity, and proceeded on his\r\nenterprise.\r\n\r\nHe hesitated a moment whether he should attempt to descend to the edge\r\nof the water; but the steepness of the rock, and darkness of the night,\r\nrendered the enterprise too dangerous. He clasped his hands above his\r\nhead and boldly sprung from the precipice, shooting himself forward into\r\nthe air as far as he could for fear of sunken rocks, and alighted on the\r\nlake, head foremost, with such force as sunk him for a minute below the\r\nsurface. But strong, long-breathed, and accustomed to such exercise,\r\nHalbert, even though encumbered with his sword, dived and rose like a\r\nseafowl, and swam across the lake in the northern direction. When he\r\nlanded and looked back on the castle, he could observe that the alarm\r\nhad been given, for lights glanced from window to window, and he heard\r\nthe drawbridge lowered, and the tread of horses\' feet upon the causeway.\r\nBut, little alarmed for the consequence of a pursuit during the\r\ndarkness, he wrung the water from his dress, and, plunging into the\r\nmoors, directed his course to the north-east by the assistance of the\r\npolar star.\r\n\r\n       *       *        *       *        *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter the Twenty-Sixth.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Why, what an intricate impeach is this!\r\n  I think you all have drank of Circe\'s cup.\r\n  If here you housed him, here he would have been;\r\n  If he were mad, he would not plead so coldly.\r\n                                  COMEDY OF ERRORS.\r\n\r\nThe course of our story, leaving for the present Halbert Glendinning\r\nto the guidance of his courage and his fortune, returns to the Tower\r\nof Glendearg, where matters in the meanwhile fell out, with which it is\r\nmost fitting that the reader should be acquainted.\r\n\r\nThe meal was prepared at noontide with all the care which Elspeth and\r\nTibb, assisted by the various accommodations which had been supplied\r\nfrom the Monastery, could bestow on it. Their dialogue ran on as\r\nusual in the intervals of their labour, partly as between mistress and\r\nservant, partly as maintained by gossips of nearly equal quality.\r\n\r\n"Look to the minced meat, Tibb," said Elspeth; "and turn the broach\r\neven, thou good-for-nothing Simmie,--thy wits are harrying birds\' nests,\r\nchild.--Weel, Tibb, this is a fasheous job, this Sir Piercie lying\r\nleaguer with us up here, and wha kens for how lang?"\r\n\r\n"A fasheous job indeed," answered her faithful attendant, "and little\r\ngood did the name ever bring to fair Scotland. Ye may have your hands\r\nfuller of them than they are yet. Mony a sair heart have the Piercies\r\ngiven to Scots wife and bairns with their pricking on the Borders.\r\nThere was Hotspur and many more of that bloody kindred, have sate in our\r\nskirts since Malcolm\'s time, as Martin says!"\r\n\r\n"Martin should keep a well-scrapit tongue in his head," said Elspeth,\r\n"and not slander the kin of any body that quarters at Glendearg; forby,\r\nthat Sir Piercie Shafton is much respected with the holy fathers of the\r\ncommunity, and they will make up to us ony fasherie that we may have\r\nwith him, either by good word or good deed, I\'se warrant them. He is a\r\nconsiderate lord the Lord Abbot."\r\n\r\n"And weel he likes a saft seat to his hinder end," said Tibb; "I have\r\nseen a belted baron sit on a bare bench, and find nae fault. But an ye\r\nare pleased, mistress, I am pleased."\r\n\r\n"Now, in good time, here comes Mysie of the Mill.--And where hae ye\r\nbeen, lass for a\'s gane wrang without you?" said Elspeth.\r\n\r\n"I just gaed a blink up the burn," said Mysie, "for the young lady has\r\nbeen down on her bed, and is no just that weel--So I gaed a gliff up the\r\nburn."\r\n\r\n"To see the young lads come hame frae the sport, I will warrant you,"\r\nsaid Elspeth. "Ay, ay, Tibb, that\'s the way the young folk guide us,\r\nTibbie--leave us to do the wark, and out to the play themsells."\r\n\r\n"Ne\'er a bit of that, mistress," said the Maid of the Mill, stripping\r\nher round pretty arms, and looking actively and good-humouredly round\r\nfor some duty that she could discharge, "but just--I thought ye might\r\nlike to ken if they were coming back, just to get the dinner forward."\r\n\r\n"And saw ye ought of them then?" demanded Elspeth.\r\n\r\n"Not the least tokening," said Mysie, "though I got to the head of a\r\nknowe, and though the English knight\'s beautiful white feather could\r\nhave been seen over all the bushes in the Shaw."\r\n\r\n"The knight\'s white feather!" said Dame Glendinning; "ye are a silly\r\nhempie--my Halbert\'s high head will be seen farther than his feather,\r\nlet it be as white as it like, I trow."\r\n\r\nMysie made no answer, but began to knead dough for wastel-cake with all\r\ndespatch, observing that Sir Piercie had partaken of that dainty, and\r\ncommended it upon the preceding day. And presently, in order to place\r\non the fire the _girdle_, or iron plate on which these cates were to be\r\nbaked, she displaced a stew-pan in which one of Tibb\'s delicacies were\r\nsubmitted to the action of the kitchen fire. Tibb muttered betwixt her\r\nteeth--"And it is the broth for my sick bairn, that maun make room\r\nfor the dainty Southron\'s wastel-bread. It was a blithe time in Wight\r\nWallace\'s day, or good King Robert\'s, when the pock-puddings gat\r\nnaething here but hard straiks and bloody crowns. But we will see how it\r\nwill a\' end."\r\n\r\nElspeth did not think it proper to notice these discontented expressions\r\nof Tibbie, but they sunk into her mind; for she was apt to consider\r\nher as a sort of authority in matters of war and policy, with which\r\nher former experience as bower-woman at Avenel Castle made her better\r\nacquainted than were the peaceful inhabitants of Halidome. She only\r\nspoke, however, to express her surprise that the hunters did not return.\r\n\r\n"An they come not back the sooner," said Tibb, "they will fare the waur,\r\nfor the meat will be roasted to a cinder--and there is poor Simmie that\r\ncan turn the spit nae langer: the bairn is melting like an icicle in\r\nwarm water--Gang awa, bairn, and take a mouthful of the caller air, and\r\nI will turn the broach till ye come back."\r\n\r\n"Rin up to the bartizan at the tower-head, callant," said Dame\r\nGlendinning, "the air will be callerer there than ony gate else, and\r\nbring us word if our Halbert and the gentleman are coming down the\r\nglen."\r\n\r\nThe boy lingered long enough to allow his substitute, Tibb Tacket,\r\nheartily to tire of her own generosity, and of his cricket-stool by the\r\nside of a huge fire. He at length returned with the news that he\r\nhad seen nobody. The matter was not so remarkable as far as Halbert\r\nGlendinning was concerned, for, patient alike of want and of fatigue, it\r\nwas no uncommon circumstance for him to remain in the wilds till curfew\r\ntime. But nobody had given Sir Piercie Shafton credit for being so keen\r\na sportsman, and the idea of an Englishman preferring the chase to his\r\ndinner was altogether inconsistent with their preconceptions of the\r\nnational character. Amidst wondering and conjecturing, the usual\r\ndinner-hour passed long away; and the inmates of the tower, taking a\r\nhasty meal themselves, adjourned their more solemn preparations until\r\nthe hunters\' return at night, since it seemed now certain that their\r\nsport had either carried them to a greater distance, or engaged them for\r\na longer time than had been expected.\r\n\r\nAbout four hours after noon, arrived, not the expected sportsmen, but\r\nan unlooked for visitant, the Sub-Prior from the Monastery. The scene\r\nof the preceding day had dwelt on the mind of Father Eustace, who was\r\nof that keen and penetrating cast of mind which loves not to leave\r\nunascertained whatever of mysterious is subjected to its inquiry. His\r\nkindness was interested in the family of Glendearg, which he had now\r\nknown for a long time; and besides, the community was interested in the\r\npreservation of the peace betwixt Sir Piercie Shafton and his youthful\r\nhost, since whatever might draw public attention on the former,\r\ncould not fail to be prejudicial to the Monastery, which was already\r\nthreatened by the hand of power. He found the family assembled, all but\r\nMary Avenel, and was informed that Halbert Glendinning had accompanied\r\nthe stranger on a day\'s sport. So far was well. They had not returned;\r\nbut when did youth and sport conceive themselves bound by set hours? and\r\nthe circumstance excited no alarm in his mind.\r\n\r\nWhile he was conversing with Edward Glendinning touching his progress\r\nin the studies he had pointed out to him, they were startled by a shriek\r\nfrom Mary Avenel\'s apartment, which drew the whole family thither in\r\nheadlong haste. They found her in a swoon in the arms of old Martin, who\r\nwas bitterly accusing himself of having killed her; so indeed it seemed,\r\nfor her pale features and closed eyes argued rather a dead corpse than a\r\nliving person. The whole family were instantly in tumult. Snatching her\r\nfrom Martin\'s arms with the eagerness of affectionate terror, Edward\r\nbore her to the casement, that she might receive the influence of the\r\nopen air; the Sub-Prior, who, like many of his profession, had some\r\nknowledge of medicine, hastened to prescribe the readiest remedies which\r\noccurred to him, and the terrified females contended with, and impeded\r\neach other, in their rival efforts to be useful.\r\n\r\n"It has been ane of her weary ghaists," said Dame Glendinning.\r\n\r\n"It\'s just a trembling on her spirits, as her blessed mother used to\r\nhave," said Tibb.\r\n\r\n"It\'s some ill news has come ower her," said the miller\'s maiden;\r\nwhile burnt feathers, cold water, and all the usual means of restoring\r\nsuspended animation, were employed alternately, and with little effect.\r\n\r\nAt length a new assistant, who had joined the group unobserved, tendered\r\nhis aid in the following terms:--"How is this, my most fair Discretion?\r\nWhat cause hath moved the ruby current of life to rush back to the\r\ncitadel of the heart, leaving pale those features in which it\r\nshould have delighted to meander for ever?--Let me approach her," he\r\nsaid,"--with this sovereign essence, distilled by the fair hands of the\r\ndivine Urania, and powerful to recall fugitive life, even if it were\r\ntrembling on the verge of departure."\r\n\r\nThus speaking, Sir Piercie Shafton knelt down, and most gracefully\r\npresented to the nostrils of Mary Avenel a silver pouncet-box,\r\nexquisitely chased, containing a sponge dipt in the essence which he\r\nrecommmended so highly. Yes, gentle reader, it was Sir Piercie Shafton\r\nhimself who thus unexpectedly proffered his good offices! his cheeks,\r\nindeed, very pale, and some part of his dress stained with blood, but\r\nnot otherwise appearing different from what he was on the preceding\r\nevening. But no sooner had Mary Avenel opened her eyes, and fixed them\r\non the figure of the officious courtier, than she screamed faintly, and\r\nexclaimed,--"Secure the murderer!"\r\n\r\nThose present stood aghast with astonishment, and none more so than the\r\nEuphuist, who found himself so suddenly and so strangely accused by\r\nthe patient whom he was endeavouring to succour, and who repelled his\r\nattempts to yield her assistance with all the energy of abhorrence.\r\n"Take him away!" she exclaimed--"take away the murderer!"\r\n\r\n"Now, by my knighthood," answered Sir Piercie, "your lovely faculties\r\neither of mind or body are, O my most fair Discretion, obnubilated by\r\nsome strange hallucination. For either your eyes do not discern that it\r\nis Piercie Shafton, your most devoted Affability, who now stands\r\nbefore you, or else, your eyes discerning truly, your mind hath most\r\nerroneously concluded that he hath been guilty of some delict or\r\nviolence to which his hand is a stranger. No murder, O most scornful\r\nDiscretion, hath been this day done, saving but that which your angry\r\nglances are now performing on your most devoted captive."\r\n\r\nHe was here interrupted by the Sub-Prior, who had, in the meantime, been\r\nspeaking with Martin apart, and had received from him an account of the\r\ncircumstances, which, suddenly communicated to Mary Avenel, had thrown\r\nher into this state. "Sir Knight," said the Sub-Prior, in a very solemn\r\ntone, yet with some hesitation, "circumstances have been communicated\r\nto us of a nature so extraordinary, that, reluctant as I am to exercise\r\nsuch authority over a guest of our venerable community, I am constrained\r\nto request from you an explanation of them. You left this tower early in\r\nthe morning, accompanied by a youth, Halbert Glendinning, the eldest son\r\nof this good dame, and you return hither without him. Where, and at what\r\nhour, did you part company from him?"\r\n\r\nThe English knight paused for a moment, and then replied,--"I marvel\r\nthat your reverence employs so grave a tone to enforce so light a\r\nquestion. I parted with the villagio whom you call Halbert Glendinning\r\nsome hour or twain after sunrise."\r\n\r\n"And at what place, I pray you?" said the monk.\r\n\r\n"In a deep ravine, where a fountain rises at the base of a huge rock; an\r\nearth-born Titan, which heaveth up its gray head, even as--"\r\n\r\n"Spare us farther description," said the Sub-Prior; "we know the spot.\r\nBut that youth hath not since been heard of, and it will fall on you to\r\naccount for him."\r\n\r\n"My bairn! my bairn!" exclaimed Dame Glendinning. "Yes, holy father,\r\nmake the villain account for my bairn!"\r\n\r\n"I swear, good woman, by bread and by water,--which are the props of our\r\nlife--"\r\n\r\n"Swear by wine and wastel-bread, for these are the props of _thy_ life,\r\nthou greedy Southron!" said Dame Glendinning;--"a base belly-god, to\r\ncome here to eat the best, and practise on our lives that give it to\r\nhim!"\r\n\r\n"I tell thee, woman," said Sir Piercie Shafton, "I did but go with thy\r\nson to the hunting."\r\n\r\n"A black hunting it has been to him, poor bairn," replied Tibb; "and sae\r\nI said it wad prove since I first saw the false Southron snout of thee.\r\nLittle good comes of a Piercie\'s hunting, from Chevy Chase till now."\r\n\r\n"Be silent, woman," said the Sub-Prior, "and rail not upon the English\r\nknight; we do not yet know of any thing beyond suspicion."\r\n\r\n"We will have his heart\'s blood!" said Dame Glendinning; and, seconded\r\nby the faithful Tibbie, she made such a sudden onslaught on the unlucky\r\nEuphuist, as must have terminated in something serious, had not the\r\nmonk, aided by Mysie Happer, interposed to protect him from their fury.\r\nEdward had left the apartment the instant the disturbance broke out,\r\nand now entered, sword in hand, followed by Martin and Jasper, the one\r\nhaving a hunting spear in his hand, the other a cross-bow.\r\n\r\n"Keep the door," he said to his two attendants; "shoot him or stab him\r\nwithout mercy, should he attempt to break forth; if he offers an escape,\r\nby Heaven he shall die!"\r\n\r\n"How now, Edward," said the Sub-Prior; "how is this that you so far\r\nforget yourself? meditating violence to a guest, and in my presence, who\r\nrepresent your liege lord?"\r\n\r\nEdward stepped forward with his drawn sword in his hand. "Pardon me,\r\nreverend father," he said, "but in this matter the voice of nature\r\nspeaks louder and stronger than yours. I turn my sword\'s point against\r\nthis proud man, and I demand of him the blood of my brother--the blood\r\nof my father\'s son--of the heir of our name! If he denies to give me a\r\ntrue account of him, he shall not deny me vengeance."\r\n\r\nEmbarrassed as he was, Sir Piercie Shafton showed no personal fear. "Put\r\nup thy sword," he said, "young man; not in the same day does Piercie\r\nShafton contend with two peasants."\r\n\r\n"Hear him! he confesses the deed, holy father," said Edward.\r\n\r\n"Be patient, my son," said the Sub-Prior, endeavouring to soothe the\r\nfeelings which he could not otherwise control, "be patient--thou wilt\r\nattain the ends of justice better through my means than thine own\r\nviolence--And you, women, be silent--Tibb, remove your mistress and Mary\r\nAvenel."\r\n\r\nWhile Tibb, with the assistance of the other females of the household,\r\nbore the poor mother and Mary Avenel into separate apartments, and while\r\nEdward, still keeping his sword in his hand, hastily traversed the room,\r\nas if to prevent the possibility of Sir Piercie Shafton\'s escape,\r\nthe Sub-Prior insisted upon knowing from the perplexed knight the\r\nparticulars which he knew respecting Halbert Glendinning. His situation\r\nbecame extremely embarrassing, for what he might with safety have told\r\nof the issue of their combat was so revolting to his pride, that he\r\ncould not bring himself to enter into the detail; and of Halbert\'s\r\nactual fate he knew, as the reader is well aware, absolutely nothing.\r\n\r\nThe father in the meanwhile pressed him with remonstrances, and prayed\r\nhim to observe, he would greatly prejudice himself by declining to give\r\na full account of the transactions of the day. "You cannot deny," he\r\nsaid, "that yesterday you seemed to take the most violent offence at\r\nthis unfortunate youth; and that you suppressed your resentment so\r\nsuddenly as to impress us all with surprise. Last night you proposed to\r\nhim this day\'s hunting party, and you set out together by break of day.\r\nYou parted, you said, at the fountain near the rock, about an hour or\r\ntwain after sunrise, and it appears that before you parted you had been\r\nat strife together."\r\n\r\n"I said not so," replied the knight. "Here is a coil indeed about the\r\nabsence of a rustical bondsman, who, I dare say, hath gone off (if he be\r\ngone) to join the next rascally band of freebooters! Ye ask me, a knight\r\nof the Piercie\'s lineage, to account for such an insignificant fugitive,\r\nand I answer,--let me know the price of his head, and I will pay it to\r\nyour convent treasurer."\r\n\r\n"You admit, then, that you have slain my brother?" said Edward,\r\ninterfering once more; "I will presently show you at what price we Scots\r\nrate the lives of our friends."\r\n\r\n"Peace, Edward, peace--I entreat--I command thee," said the Sub-Prior.\r\n"And you, Sir Knight, think better of us than to suppose you may spend\r\nScottish blood, and reckon for it as for wine spilt in a drunken revel.\r\nThis youth was no bondsman--thou well knowest, that in thine own land\r\nthou hadst not dared to lift thy sword against the meanest subject of\r\nEngland, but her laws would have called thee to answer for the deed. Do\r\nnot hope it will be otherwise here, for you will but deceive yourself."\r\n\r\n"You drive me beyond my patience," said the Euphuist, "even as the\r\nover-driven ox is urged into madness!--What can I tell you of a young\r\nfellow whom I have not seen since the second hour after sunrise?"\r\n\r\n"But can you explain in what circumstances you parted with him?" said\r\nthe monk.\r\n\r\n"What _are_ the circumstances, in the devil\'s name, which you desire\r\nshould be explained?--for although I protest against this constraint as\r\nalike unworthy and inhospitable, yet would I willingly end this fray,\r\nprovided that by words it may be ended," said the knight.\r\n\r\n"If these end it not," said Edward, "blows shall, and that full\r\nspeedily."\r\n\r\n"Peace, impatient boy!" said the Sub-Prior; "and do you, Sir Piercie\r\nShafton, acquaint me why the ground is bloody by the verge of the\r\nfountain in Corri-nan-shian, where, as you say yourself, you parted from\r\nHalbert Glendinning?"\r\n\r\nResolute not to avow his defeat if possibly he could avoid it, the\r\nknight answered in a haughty tone, that he supposed it was no unusual\r\nthing to find the turf bloody where hunters had slain a deer.\r\n\r\n"And did you bury your game as well as kill it?" said the monk. "We must\r\nknow from you who is the tenant of that grave, that newly-made grave,\r\nbeside the very fountain whose margin is so deeply crimsoned with\r\nblood?--thou seest thou canst not evade me; therefore be ingenuous, and\r\ntell us the fate of this unhappy youth, whose body is doubtless lying\r\nunder that bloody turf."\r\n\r\n"If it be," said Sir Piercie, "they must have buried him alive; for I\r\nswear to thee, reverend father, that this rustic juvenal parted from me\r\nin perfect health. Let the grave be searched, and if his body be found,\r\nthen deal with me as ye list."\r\n\r\n"It is not my sphere to determine thy fate, Sir Knight, but that of the\r\nLord Abbot, and the right reverend Chapter. It is but my duty to collect\r\nsuch information as may best possess their wisdom with the matters which\r\nhave chanced."\r\n\r\n"Might I presume so far, reverend father," said the knight, "I should\r\nwish to know the author and evidence of all these suspicions, so\r\nunfoundedly urged against me?"\r\n\r\n"It is soon told," said the Sub-Prior; "nor do I wish to disguise it, if\r\nit can avail you in your defence. This maiden, Mary Avenel, apprehending\r\nthat you nourished malice against her foster-brother under a friendly\r\nbrow, did advisedly send up the old man, Martin Tacket, to follow your\r\nfootsteps and to prevent mischief. But it seems that your evil passions\r\nhad outrun precaution: for when he came to the spot, guided by your\r\nfootsteps upon the dew, he found but the bloody turf and the new covered\r\ngrave; and after long and vain search through the wilds after Halbert\r\nand yourself, he brought back the sorrowful news to her who had sent\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"Saw he not my doublet, I pray you?" said Sir Piercie; "for when I came\r\nto myself, I found that I was wrapped in my cloak, but without my under\r\ngarment as your reverence may observe."\r\n\r\nSo saying, he opened his cloak, forgetting, with his characteristical\r\ninconsistency, that he showed his shirt stained with blood.\r\n\r\n"How! cruel man," said the monk, when he observed this confirmation of\r\nhis suspicions; "wilt thou deny the guilt, even while thou bearest on\r\nthy person the blood thou hast shed?--Wilt thou longer deny that thy\r\nrash hand has robbed a mother of a son, our community of a vassal, the\r\nQueen of Scotland of a liege subject? and what canst thou expect, but\r\nthat, at the least, we deliver thee up to England, as undeserving our\r\nfarther protection?"\r\n\r\n"By the Saints!" said the knight, now driven to extremity, "if this\r\nblood be the witness against me, it is but rebel blood, since this\r\nmorning at sunrise it flowed within my own veins."\r\n\r\n"How were that possible, Sir Piercie Shafton," said the monk, "since I\r\nsee no wound from whence it can have flowed?"\r\n\r\n"That," said the knight, "is the most mysterious part of the\r\ntransaction--See here!"\r\n\r\nSo saying, he undid his shirt collar, and, opening his bosom, showed the\r\nspot through--which Halbert\'s sword had passed, but already cicatrized,\r\nand bearing the appearance of a wound lately healed.\r\n\r\n"This exhausts my patience, Sir Knight," said the Sub-Prior, "and is\r\nadding insult to violence and injury. Do you hold me for a child or an\r\nidiot, that you pretend to make me believe that the fresh blood with\r\nwhich your shirt is stained, flowed from a wound which has been healed\r\nfor weeks or months? Unhappy mocker, thinkest thou thus to blind us? Too\r\nwell do we know that it is the blood of your victim, wrestling with you\r\nin the desperate and mortal struggle, which has thus dyed your apparel."\r\n\r\nThe knight, after a moment\'s recollection, said in reply, "I will be\r\nopen with you, my father--bid these men stand out of ear-shot, and I\r\nwill tell you all I know of this mysterious business; and muse not, good\r\nfather, though it may pass thy wit to expound it, for I avouch to you it\r\nis too dark for mine own."\r\n\r\nThe monk commanded Edward and the two men to withdraw, assuring the\r\nformer that his conference with the prisoner should be brief, and giving\r\nhim permission to keep watch at the door of the apartment; without which\r\nallowance he might, perhaps, have had some difficulty in procuring\r\nhis absence. Edward had no sooner left the chamber, than he despatched\r\nmessengers to one or two families of the Halidome, with whose sons\r\nhis brother and he sometimes associated, to tell them that Halbert\r\nGlendinning had been murdered by an Englishman, and to require them to\r\nrepair to the Tower of Glendearg without delay. The duty of revenge in\r\nsuch cases was held so sacred, that he had no reason to doubt they would\r\ninstantly come with such assistance as would ensure the detention of the\r\nprisoner. He then locked the doors of the tower, both inner and outer,\r\nand also the gate of the court-yard. Having taken these precautions, he\r\nmade a hasty visit to the females of the family, exhausting himself\r\nin efforts to console them, and in protestations that he would have\r\nvengeance for his murdered brother.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter the Twenty-Seventh.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Now, by Our Lady, Sheriff,\'tis hard reckoning,\r\n  That I, with every odds of birth and barony\r\n  Should be detain\'d here for the casual death\r\n  Of a wild forester, whose utmost having\r\n  Is but the brazen buckle of the belt\r\n  In which he sticks his hedge-knife.\r\n                                        OLD PLAY.\r\n\r\nWhile Edward was making preparations for securing and punishing the\r\nsupposed murderer of his brother, with an intense thirst for vengeance,\r\nwhich had not hitherto shown itself as part of his character, Sir\r\nPiercie Shafton made such communications as it pleased him to the\r\nSub-Prior, who listened with great attention, though the knight\'s\r\nnarrative was none of the clearest, especially as his self-conceit led\r\nhim to conceal or abridge the details which were necessary to render it\r\nintelligible.\r\n\r\n"You are to know," he said, "reverend father, that this rustical juvenal\r\nhaving chosen to offer me, in the presence of your venerable Superior,\r\nyourself, and other excellent and worthy persons, besides the damsel,\r\nMary Avenel, whom I term my Discretion in all honour and kindness, a\r\ngross insult, rendered yet more intolerable by the time and place,\r\nmy just resentment did so gain the mastery over my discretion, that I\r\nresolved to allow him the privileges of an equal, and to indulge him\r\nwith the combat."\r\n\r\n"But, Sir Knight," said the Sub-Prior, "you still leave two matters\r\nvery obscure. First, why the token he presented to you gave you so much\r\noffence, as I with others witnessed; and then again, how the youth, whom\r\nyou then met for the first, or, at least, the second time, knew so much\r\nof your history as enabled him so greatly to move you."\r\n\r\nThe knight coloured very deeply.\r\n\r\n"For your first query," he said, "most reverend father, we will, if you\r\nplease, pretermit it as nothing essential to the matter in hand; and\r\nfor the second--I protest to you that I know as little of his means of\r\nknowledge as you do, and that I am well-nigh persuaded he deals with\r\nSathanas, of which more anon.--Well, sir--In the evening, I failed not\r\nto veil my purpose with a pleasant brow, as is the custom amongst us\r\nmartialists, who never display the bloody colours of defiance in our\r\ncountenance until our hand is armed to fight under them. I amused the\r\nfair Discretion with some canzonettes, and other toys, which could not\r\nbut be ravishing to her inexperienced ears. I arose in the morning, and\r\nmet my antagonist, who, to say truth, for an inexperienced villagio,\r\ncomported himself as stoutly as I could have desired.--So, coming to the\r\nencounter, reverend sir, I did try his mettle with some half-a-dozen of\r\ndownright passes, with any one of which I could have been through his\r\nbody, only that I was loth to take so fatal an advantage, but rather,\r\nmixing mercy with my just indignation, studied to inflict upon him\r\nsome flesh-wound of no very fatal quality. But, sir, in the midst of my\r\nclemency, he, being instigated, I think, by the devil, did follow up\r\nhis first offence with some insult of the same nature. Whereupon, being\r\neager to punish him, I made an estramazone, and my foot slipping at the\r\nsame time,--not from any fault of fence on my part, or any advantage of\r\nskill on his, but the devil having, as I said, taken up the matter\r\nin hand, and the grass being slippery,--ere I recovered my position I\r\nencountered his sword, which he had advanced, with my undefended\r\nperson, so that, as I think, I was in some sort run through the body.\r\nMy juvenal, being beyond measure appalled at his own unexpected and\r\nunmerited success in this strange encounter, takes the flight and leaves\r\nme there, and I fall into a dead swoon for the lack of the blood I\r\nhad lost so foolishly--and when I awake, as from a sound sleep, I find\r\nmyself lying, an it like you, wrapt up in my cloak at the foot of one\r\nof the birch-trees which stand together in a clump near to this place.\r\nI feel my limbs, and experience little pain, but much weakness--I put\r\nmy hand to the wound--it was whole and skinned over as you now see it--I\r\nrise and come hither; and in these words you have my whole day\'s story."\r\n\r\n"I can only reply to so strange a tale," answered the monk, "that it\r\nis scarce possible that Sir Piercie Shafton can expect me to credit it.\r\nHere is a quarrel, the cause of which you conceal--a wound received in\r\nthe morning, of which there is no recent appearance at sunset,--a grave\r\nfilled up, in which no body is deposited--the vanquished found alive\r\nand well--the victor departed no man knows whither. These things,\r\nSir Knight, hang not so well together, that I should receive them as\r\ngospel."\r\n\r\n"Reverend father," answered Sir Piercie Shafton, "I pray you in the\r\nfirst place to observe, that if I offer peaceful and civil justification\r\nof that which I have already averred to be true, I do so only in devout\r\ndeference to your dress and to your order, protesting, that to any other\r\nopposite, saving a man of religion, a lady or my liege prince, I would\r\nnot deign to support that which I had once attested, otherwise than with\r\nthe point of my good sword. And so much being premised, I have to add,\r\nthat I can but gage my honour as a gentleman, and my faith as a Catholic\r\nChristian, that the things which I have described to you have happened\r\nto me as I have described them, and not otherwise."\r\n\r\n"It is a deep assertion, Sir Knight," answered the Sub-Prior; "yet,\r\nbethink you, it is only an assertion, and that no reason can be alleged\r\nwhy things should be believed which are so contrary to reason. Let me\r\npray you to say whether the grave, which has been seen at your place of\r\ncombat, was open or closed when your encounter took place?"\r\n\r\n"Reverend father," said the knight, "I will veil from you nothing, but\r\nshow you each secret of my bosom; even as the pure fountain revealeth\r\nthe smallest pebble which graces the sand at the bottom of its crystal\r\nmirror, and as--"\r\n\r\n"Speak in plain terms, for the love of heaven!" said the monk; "these\r\nholiday phrases belong not to solemn affairs--Was the grave open when\r\nthe conflict began?"\r\n\r\n"It was," answered the knight, "I acknowledge it; even as he that\r\nacknowledgeth--"\r\n\r\n"Nay, I pray you, fair son, forbear these similitudes, and observe me.\r\nOn yesterday at even no grave was found in that place, for old Martin\r\nchanced, contrary to his wont, to go thither in quest of a strayed\r\nsheep. At break of day, by your own confession, a grave was opened in\r\nthat spot, and there a combat was fought--only one of the combatants\r\nappears, and he is covered with blood, and to all appearance\r\nwoundless."--Here the knight made a gesture of impatience.--"Nay, fair\r\nson, hear me but one moment--the grave is closed and covered by the\r\nsod--what can we believe, but that it conceals the bloody corpse of the\r\nfallen duellist?"\r\n\r\n"By Heaven, it cannot!" said the knight, "unless the juvenal hath slain\r\nhimself and buried himself, in order to place me in the predicament of\r\nhis murderer."\r\n\r\n"The grave shall doubtless be explored, and that by to-morrow\'s dawn,"\r\nsaid the monk, "I will see it done with mine own eyes."\r\n\r\n"But," said the prisoner, "I protest against all evidence which may\r\narise from its contents, and do insist beforehand, that whatever may be\r\nfound in that grave shall not prejudice me in my defence. I have been so\r\nhaunted by diabolical deceptions in this matter, that what do I know but\r\nthat the devil may assume the form of this rustical juvenal, in order\r\nto procure me farther vexation?--I protest to you, holy father, it is\r\nmy very thought that there is witchcraft in all that hath befallen me.\r\nSince I entered into this northern land, in which men say that sorceries\r\ndo abound, I, who am held in awe and regard even by the prime gallants\r\nin the court of Feliciana, have been here bearded and taunted by a\r\nclod-treading clown. I, whom Vincentio Saviola termed his nimblest and\r\nmost agile disciple, was, to speak briefly, foiled by a cow-boy, who\r\nknew no more of fence than is used at every country wake. I am run, as\r\nit seemed to me, through the body, with a very sufficient stoccata, and\r\nfaint on the spot; and yet, when I recover, I find myself without\r\neither wem or wound, and, lacking nothing of my apparel, saving my\r\nmurrey-coloured doublet, slashed with satin, which I will pray may be\r\ninquired after, lest the devil, who transported me, should have dropped\r\nit in his passage among some of the trees or bushes--it being a choice\r\nand most fanciful piece of raiment, which I wore for the first time at\r\nthe Queen\'s pageant in Southwark."\r\n\r\n"Sir Knight," said the monk, "you do again go astray from this matter.\r\nI inquire of you respecting that which concerns the life of another man,\r\nand it may be, touches your own also, and you answer me with the tale of\r\nan old doublet!"\r\n\r\n"Old!" exclaimed the knight; "now, by the gods and saints, if there be\r\na gallant at the British Court more fancifully considerate, and more\r\nconsiderately fanciful, but quaintly curious, and more curiously quaint,\r\nin frequent changes of all rich articles of vesture, becoming one who\r\nmay be accounted point-de-vice a courtier, I will give you leave to term\r\nme a slave and a liar."\r\n\r\nThe monk thought, but did not say, that he had already acquired right\r\nto doubt the veracity of the Euphuist, considering the marvellous tale\r\nwhich he had told. Yet his own strange adventure, and that of Father\r\nPhilip, rushed on his mind, and forbade his coming to any conclusion. He\r\ncontented himself, therefore, with observing, that these were certainly\r\nstrange incidents, and requested to know if Sir Piercie Shafton had any\r\nother reason for suspecting himself to be in a manner so particularly\r\nselected for the sport of sorcery and witchcraft.\r\n\r\n"Sir Sub-Prior," said the Euphuist, "the most extraordinary circumstance\r\nremains behind, which alone, had I neither been bearded in dispute, nor\r\nfoiled in combat, nor wounded and cured in the space of a few hours,\r\nwould nevertheless of itself, and without any other corroborative,\r\nhave compelled me to believe myself the subject of some malevolent\r\nfascination. Reverend sir, it is not to your ears that men should tell\r\ntales of love and gallantry, nor is Sir Piercie Shafton one who, to any\r\nears whatsoever, is wont to boast of his fair acceptance with the choice\r\nand prime beauties of the court; insomuch that a lady, none of the least\r\nresplendent constellations which revolve in that hemisphere of honour,\r\npleasure, and beauty, but whose name I here pretermit, was wont to call\r\nme her Taciturnity. Nevertheless truth must be spoken; and I cannot but\r\nallow, as the general report of the court, allowed in camps, and echoed\r\nback by city and country, that in the alacrity of the accost, the tender\r\ndelicacy of the regard, the facetiousness of the address, the adopting\r\nand pursuing of the fancy, the solemn close and the graceful fall-off,\r\nPiercie Shafton was accounted the only gallant of the time, and so\r\nwell accepted among the choicer beauties of the age, that no silk-hosed\r\nreveller of the presence-chamber, or plumed jouster of the tilt-yard,\r\napproached him by a bow\'s length in the ladies\' regard, being the\r\nmark at which every well-born and generous juvenal aimeth his shaft.\r\nNevertheless, reverend sir, having found in this rude place something\r\nwhich by blood and birth might be termed a lady, and being desirous to\r\nkeep my gallant humour in exercise, as well as to show my sworn devotion\r\nto the sex in general, I did shoot off some arrows of compliment at\r\nthis Mary Avenel, terming her my Discretion, with other quaint and\r\nwell-imagined courtesies, rather bestowed out of my bounty than\r\nwarranted by her merit, or perchance like unto the boyish fowler, who,\r\nrather than not exercise his bird-piece, will shoot at crows or magpies\r\nfor lack of better game----"\r\n\r\n"Mary Avenel is much obliged by your notice," answered the monk; "but to\r\nwhat does all this detail of past and present gallantry conduct us?"\r\n\r\n"Marry, to this conclusion," answered the knight; "that either this my\r\nDiscretion, or I myself, am little less than bewitched; for, instead of\r\nreceiving my accost with a gratifying bow, answering my regard with a\r\nsuppressed smile, accompanying my falling off or departure with a\r\nslight sigh--honours with which I protest to you the noblest dancers and\r\nproudest beauties in Feliciana have graced my poor services--she hath\r\npaid me as little and as cold regard as if I had been some hob-nailed\r\nclown of these bleak mountains! Nay, this very day, while I was in the\r\nact of kneeling at her feet to render her the succours of this pungent\r\nquintessence, of purest spirit distilled by the fairest hands of the\r\ncourt of Feliciana, she pushed me from her with looks which savoured of\r\nrepugnance, and, as I think, thrust at me with her foot as if to spurn\r\nme from her presence. These things, reverend father, are strange,\r\nportentous, unnatural, and befall not in the current of mortal affairs,\r\nbut are symptomatic of sorcery and fascination. So that, having given to\r\nyour reverence a perfect, simple, and plain account of all that I know\r\nconcerning this matter, I leave it to your wisdom to solve what may be\r\nfound soluble in the same, it being my purpose to-morrow, with the peep\r\nof dawn, to set forward towards Edinburgh."\r\n\r\n"I grieve to be an interruption to your designs, Sir Knight," said the\r\nmonk, "but that purpose of thine may hardly be fulfilled."\r\n\r\n"How, reverend father!" said the knight, with an air of the utmost\r\nsurprise; "if what you say respects my departure, understand that it\r\n_must_ be, for I have so resolved it."\r\n\r\n"Sir Knight," reiterated the Sub-Prior, "I must once more repeat, this\r\n_cannot_ be, until the Abbot\'s pleasure be known in the matter."\r\n\r\n"Reverend sir," said the knight, drawing himself up with great dignity,\r\n"I desire my hearty and thankful commendations to the Abbot; but in this\r\nmatter I have nothing to do with his reverend pleasure, designing only\r\nto consult my own."\r\n\r\n"Pardon me," said the Sub-Prior; "the Lord Abbot hath in this matter a\r\nvoice potential."\r\n\r\nSir Piercie Shafton\'s colour began to rise--"I marvel," he said, "to\r\nhear your reverence talk thus--What! will you, for the imagined death\r\nof a rude, low-born frampler and wrangler, venture to impinge upon the\r\nliberty of the kinsman of the house of Piercie?"\r\n\r\n"Sir Knight," returned the Sub-Prior, civilly, "your high lineage and\r\nyour kindling anger will avail you nothing in this matter--You shall\r\nnot come here to seek a shelter, and then spill our blood as if it were\r\nwater."\r\n\r\n"I tell you," said the knight, "once more, as I have told you already,\r\nthat there was no blood spilled but mine own!"\r\n\r\n"That remains to be proved," replied the Sub-Prior; "we of the community\r\nof Saint Mary\'s of Kennaquhair, use not to take fairy tales in exchange\r\nfor the lives of our liege vassals."\r\n\r\n"We of the house of Piercie," answered Shafton, "brook neither threats\r\nnor restraint--I say I will travel to-morrow, happen what may!"\r\n\r\n"And I," answered the Sub-Prior, in the same tone of determination, "say\r\nthat I will break your journey, come what may!"\r\n\r\n"Who shall gainsay me," said the knight, "if I make my way by force?"\r\n\r\n"You will judge wisely to think ere you make such an attempt," answered\r\nthe monk, with composure; "there are men enough in the Halidome to\r\nvindicate its rights over those who dare infringe them."\r\n\r\n"My cousin of Northumberland will know how to revenge this usage to a\r\nbeloved kinsman so near to his blood," said the Englishman.\r\n\r\n"The Lord Abbot will know how to protect the rights of his territory,\r\nboth with, the temporal and spiritual sword," said the monk. "Besides,\r\nconsider, were we to send you to your kinsman at Alnwick or Warkworth\r\nto-morrow, he dare do nothing but transmit you in fetters to the Queen\r\nof England. Bethink, Sir Knight, that you stand on slippery ground, and\r\nwill act most wisely in reconciling yourself to be a prisoner in this\r\nplace until the Abbot shall decide the matter. There are armed men enow\r\nto countervail all your efforts at escape. Let patience and resignation,\r\ntherefore, arm you to a necessary submission."\r\n\r\nSo saying, he clapped his hands, and called aloud. Edward entered,\r\naccompanied by two young men who had already joined him, and were well\r\narmed.\r\n\r\n"Edward," said the Sub-Prior, "you will supply the English Knight here\r\nin this spence with suitable food and accommodation for the night,\r\ntreating him with as much kindness as if nothing had happened between\r\nyou. But you will place a sufficient guard, and look carefully that he\r\nmake not his escape. Should he attempt to break forth, resist him to\r\nthe death; but in no other case harm a hair of his head, as you shall be\r\nanswerable."\r\n\r\nEdward Glendinning replied,--"That I may obey your commands, reverend\r\nsir, I will not again offer myself to this person\'s presence; for shame\r\nit were to me to break the peace of the Halidome, but not less shame to\r\nleave my brother\'s death unavenged."\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, his lips grew livid, the blood forsook his cheek, and he\r\nwas about to leave the apartment, when the Sub-Prior recalled him and\r\nsaid in a solemn tone,--"Edward, I have known you from infancy--I have\r\ndone what lay within my reach to be of use to you--I say nothing of what\r\nyou owe to me as the representative of your spiritual Superior--I say\r\nnothing of the duty from the vassal to the Sub-Prior--But Father Eustace\r\nexpects from the pupil whom he has nurtured--he expects from Edward\r\nGlendinning, that he will not by any deed of sudden violence, however\r\njustified in his own mind by the provocation, break through the respect\r\ndue to public justice, or that which he has an especial right to claim\r\nfrom him."\r\n\r\n"Fear nothing, my reverend father, for so in an hundred senses may I\r\nwell term you," said the young man; "fear not, I would say, that I will\r\nin any thing diminish the respect I owe to the venerable community by\r\nwhom we have so long been protected, far less that I will do aught\r\nwhich can be personally less than respectful to you. But the blood of\r\nmy brother must not cry for vengeance in vain--your reverence knows our\r\nBorder creed."\r\n\r\n"\'Vengeance is mine, saith the Lord, and I will requite it,\'" answered\r\nthe monk. "The heathenish custom of deadly feud which prevails in this\r\nland, through which each man seeks vengeance at his own hand when the\r\ndeath of a friend or kinsman has chanced, hath already deluged our vales\r\nwith the blood of Scottish men, spilled by the hands of countrymen and\r\nkindred. It were endless to count up the fatal results. On the Eastern\r\nBorder, the Homes are at feud with the Swintons and Cockburns; in our\r\nMiddle Marches, the Scotts and Kerrs have spilled as much brave blood\r\nin domestic feud as might have fought a pitched field in England, could\r\nthey have but forgiven and forgotten a casual rencounter that placed\r\ntheir names in opposition to each other. On the west frontier, the\r\nJohnstones are at war with the Maxwells, the Jardines with the Bells,\r\ndrawing with them the flower of the country, which should place their\r\nbreasts as a bulwark against England, into private and bloody warfare,\r\nof which it is the only end to waste and impair the forces of the\r\ncountry, already divided in itself. Do not, my dear son Edward, permit\r\nthis bloody prejudice to master your mind. I cannot ask you to think\r\nof the crime supposed as if the blood spilled had been less dear\r\nto you--Alas! I know that is impossible. But I do require you, in\r\nproportion to your interest in the supposed sufferer, (for as yet the\r\nwhole is matter of supposition,) to bear on your mind the evidence on\r\nwhich the guilt of the accused person must be tried. He hath spoken\r\nwith me, and I confess his tale is so extraordinary, that I should have,\r\nwithout a moment\'s hesitation, rejected it as incredible, but that an\r\naffair which chanced to myself in this very glen--More of that another\r\ntime--Suffice it for the present to say, that from what I have myself\r\nexperienced, I deem it possible, that, extraordinary as Sir Piercie\r\nShafton\'s story may seem, I hold it not utterly impossible."\r\n\r\n"Father," said Edward Glendinning, when he saw that his preceptor\r\npaused, unwilling farther to explain upon what grounds he was inclined\r\nto give a certain degree of credit to Sir Piercie Shafton\'s story,\r\nwhile he admitted it as improbable--"Father to me you have been in every\r\nsense. You know that my hand grasped more readily to the book than to\r\nthe sword; and that I lacked utterly the ready and bold spirit which\r\ndistinguished----" Here his voice faltered, and he paused for a moment,\r\nand then went on with resolution and rapidity--"I would say, that I was\r\nunequal to Halbert in promptitude of heart and of hand; but Halbert\r\nis gone, and I stand his representative, and that of my father--his\r\nsuccessor in all his rights," (while he said this his eyes shot fire,)\r\n"and bound to assert and maintain them as he would have done--therefore\r\nI am a changed man, increased in courage as in my rights and\r\npretensions. And, reverend father, respectfully, but plainly and\r\nfirmly do I say, his blood, if it has been shed by this man, shall be\r\natoned--Halbert shall not sleep neglected in his lonely grave, as if\r\nwith him the spirit of my father had ceased forever. His blood flows\r\nin my veins, and while his has been poured forth unrequited, mine will\r\npermit me no rest. My poverty and meanness of rank shall not avail the\r\nlordly murderer. My calm nature and peaceful studies shall not be his\r\nprotection. Even the obligations, holy father, which I acknowledge to\r\nyou, shall not be his protection. I wait with patience the judgment of\r\nthe Abbot and Chapter, for the slaughter of one of their most anciently\r\ndescended vassals. If they do right to my brother\'s memory, it is well.\r\nBut mark me, father, if they shall fail in rendering me that justice, I\r\nbear a heart and a hand which, though I love not such extremities,\r\nare capable of remedying such an error. He who takes up my brother\'s\r\nsuccession must avenge his death."\r\n\r\nThe monk perceived with surprise, that Edward, with his extreme\r\ndiffidence, humility, and obedient assiduity, for such were his general\r\ncharacteristics, had still boiling in his veins the wild principles of\r\nthose from whom he was descended, and by whom he was surrounded. His\r\neyes sparkled, his frame was agitated, and the extremity of his desire\r\nfor vengeance seemed to give a vehemence to his manner resembling the\r\nrestlessness of joy.\r\n\r\n"May God help us," said Father Eustace, "for, frail wretches as we are,\r\nwe cannot help ourselves under sudden and strong temptation.--Edward, I\r\nwill rely on your word that you do nothing rashly."\r\n\r\n"That will I not," said Edward,--"that, my better than father, I\r\nsurely will not. But the blood of my brother,--the tears of my\r\nmother--and--and--and of Mary Avenel, shall not be shed in vain. I will\r\nnot deceive you, father--if this Piercie Shafton hath slain my brother,\r\nhe dies, if the whole blood of the whole house of Piercie were in his\r\nveins."\r\n\r\nThere was a deep and solemn determination in the utterance of Edward\r\nGlendinning expressive of a rooted resolution. The Sub-Prior sighed\r\ndeeply, and for the moment yielded to circumstances, and urged the\r\nacquiescence of his pupil no farther. He commanded lights to be placed\r\nin the lower chamber, which for a time he paced in silence.\r\n\r\nA thousand ideas, and even differing principles, debated with each other\r\nin his bosom. He greatly doubted the English knight\'s account of\r\nthe duel, and of what had followed it. Yet the extraordinary and\r\nsupernatural circumstances which had befallen the Sacristan and himself\r\nin that very glen, prevented him from being absolutely incredulous on\r\nthe score of the wonderful wound and recovery of Sir Piercie Shafton,\r\nand prevented him from at once condemning as impossible that which\r\nwas altogether improbable. Then he was at a loss how to control the\r\nfraternal affections of Edward, with respect to whom he felt something\r\nlike the keeper of a wild animal, a lion\'s whelp or tiger\'s cub, which\r\nhe has held under his command from infancy, but which, when grown to\r\nmaturity, on some sudden provocation displays his fangs and talons,\r\nerects his crest, resumes his savage nature, and bids defiance at once\r\nto his keeper and to all mankind.\r\n\r\nHow to restrain and mitigate an ire which the universal example of the\r\ntimes rendered deadly and inveterate, was sufficient cause of anxiety\r\nto Father Eustace. But he had also to consider the situation of\r\nhis community, dishonoured and degraded by submitting to suffer the\r\nslaughter of a vassal to pass unavenged; a circumstance which of itself\r\nmight in those times have afforded pretext for a revolt among their\r\nwavering adherents, or, on the other hand, exposed the community to\r\nimminent danger, should they proceed against a subject of England of\r\nhigh degree, connected with the house of Northumberland, and other\r\nnorthern families of high rank, who, as they possessed the means, could\r\nnot be supposed to lack inclination, to wreak upon the patrimony of\r\nSaint Mary of Kennaquhair, any violence which might be offered to their\r\nkinsman.\r\n\r\nIn either case, the Sub-Prior well knew that the ostensible cause of\r\nfeud, insurrection, or incursion, being once afforded, the case would\r\nnot be ruled either by reason or by evidence, and he groaned in spirit\r\nwhen, upon counting up the chances which arose in this ambiguous\r\ndilemma, he found he had only a choice of difficulties. He was a monk,\r\nbut he felt also as a man, indignant at the supposed slaughter of young\r\nGlendinning by one skilful in all the practice of arms, in which the\r\nvassal of the Monastery was most likely to be deficient; and to aid the\r\nresentment which he felt for the loss of a youth whom he had known\r\nfrom infancy, came in full force the sense of dishonour arising to his\r\ncommunity from passing over so gross an insult unavenged. Then the light\r\nin which it might be viewed by those who at present presided in the\r\nstormy Court of Scotland, attached as they were to the Reformation, and\r\nallied by common faith and common interest with Queen Elizabeth, was\r\na formidable subject of apprehension. The Sub-Prior well knew how they\r\nlusted after the revenues of the Church, (to express it in the ordinary\r\nphrase of the religious of the time,) and how readily they would grasp\r\nat such a pretext for encroaching on those of Saint Mary\'s, as would\r\nbe afforded by the suffering to pass unpunished the death of a native\r\nScottishman by a Catholic Englishman, a rebel to Queen Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, to deliver up to England, or, which was nearly the\r\nsame thing, the Scottish administration, an English knight leagued with\r\nthe Piercie by kindred and political intrigue, a faithful follower of\r\nthe Catholic Church, who had fled to the Halidome for protection, was,\r\nin the estimation of the Sub-Prior, an act most unworthy in itself, and\r\nmeriting the malediction of Heaven, besides being, moreover, fraught\r\nwith great temporal risk. If the government of Scotland was now almost\r\nentirely in the hands of the Protestant party, the Queen was still a\r\nCatholic, and there was no knowing when, amid the sudden changes which\r\nagitated that tumultuous country, she might find herself at the head of\r\nher own affairs, and able to protect those of her own faith. Then,\r\nif the Court of England and its Queen were zealously Protestant, the\r\nnorthern counties, whose friendship or enmity were of most consequence\r\nin the first instance to the community of Saint Mary\'s, contained many\r\nCatholics, the heads of whom were able, and must be supposed willing, to\r\navenge any injury suffered by Sir Piercie Shafton.\r\n\r\nOn either side, the Sub-Prior, thinking, according to his sense of duty,\r\nmost anxiously for the safety and welfare of his Monastery, saw the\r\ngreatest risk of damage, blame, inroad, and confiscation. The only\r\ncourse on which he could determine, was to stand by the helm like a\r\nresolute pilot, watch every contingence, do his best to weather each\r\nreef and shoal, and commit the rest to heaven and his patroness.\r\n\r\nAs he left the apartment, the knight called after him, beseeching he\r\nwould order his trunk-mails to be sent into his apartment, understanding\r\nhe was to be guarded there for the night, as he wished to make some\r\nalteration in his apparel.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Sir Piercie Shafton\'s extreme love of dress was an attribute\r\nof the coxcombs of this period. The display made by their forefathers\r\nwas in the numbers of their retinue; but as the actual influence of\r\nthe nobility began to be restrained both in France and England by the\r\nincreasing power of the crown, the indulgence of vanity in personal\r\ndisplay became more inordinate. There are many allusions to this change\r\nof custom in Shakspeare and other dramatic writers, where the reader may\r\nfind mention made of\r\n\r\n  "Bonds enter\'d into\r\n  For gay apparel against the triumph day."\r\n\r\nJonson informs us, that for the first entrance of a gallant, "\'twere\r\ngood you turned four or five hundred acres of your best land into two or\r\nthree trunks of apparel."--_Every Man out of his Humour._\r\n\r\nIn the Memorie of the Somerville family, a curious instance occurs of\r\nthis fashionable species of extravagance. In the year 1537, when James\r\nV. brought over his shortlived bride from France, the Lord Somerville\r\nof the day was so profuse in the expense of his apparel, that the money\r\nwhich he borrowed on the occasion was compensated by a perpetual annuity\r\nof threescore pounds Scottish, payable out of the barony of Carnwarth\r\ntill doomsday, which was assigned by the creditor to Saint Magdalen\'s\r\nChapel. By this deep expense the Lord Somerville had rendered himself so\r\nglorious in apparel, that the King, who saw so brave a gallant enter the\r\ngate of Holyrood, followed, by only two pages, called upon several of\r\nthe courtiers to ascertain who it could be who was so richly dressed\r\nand so slightly attended, and he was not recognised until he entered the\r\npresence-chamber. "You are very brave, my lord," said the King, as he\r\nreceived his homage; "but where are all your men and attendants?" The\r\nLord Somerville readily answered, "If it please your Majesty, here they\r\nare," pointing to the lace that was on his own and his pages\' clothes:\r\nwhereat the King laughed heartily, and having surveyed the finery more\r\nnearly, bade him have away with it all, and let him have his stout band\r\nof spears again.\r\n\r\nThere is a scene in Jonson\'s "Every Man out of his Humour," (Act IV.\r\nScene 6.) in which a Euphuist of the time gives an account of the\r\neffects of a duel on the clothes of himself and his opponent, and never\r\ndeparts a syllable from the catalogue of his wardrobe. We shall insert\r\nit in evidence that the foppery of our ancestors was not inferior to\r\nthat of our own time.\r\n\r\n"_Fastidius_. Good faith, Signior, now you speak of a quarrel, I\'ll\r\nacquaint you with a difference that happened between a gallant and\r\nmyself, Sir Puntarvolo. You know him if I should name him--Signor\r\nLuculento.\r\n\r\n"_Punt_. Luculento! What inauspicious chance interposed itself to your\r\ntwo lives?\r\n\r\n"_Fast_. Faith, sir, the same that sundered Agamemnon, and great Thetis\'\r\nson; but let the cause escape, sir. He sent me a challenge, mixt with\r\nsome few braves, which I restored; and, in fine, we met. Now indeed,\r\nsir, I must tell you, he did offer at first very desperately, but\r\nwithout judgment; for look you, sir, I cast myself into this figure;\r\nnow he came violently on, and withal advancing his rapier to strike, I\r\nthought to have took his arm, for he had left his body to my election,\r\nand I was sure he could not recover his guard. Sir, I mist my purpose in\r\nhis arm, rashed his doublet sleeves, ran him close by the left cheek\r\nand through his hair. He, again, light me here--I had on a gold cable\r\nhat-band, then new come up, about a murrey French hat I had; cuts my\r\nhat-band, and yet it was massy goldsmith\'s work, cuts my brim, which,\r\nby good fortune, being thick embroidered with gold twist and spangles,\r\ndisappointed the force of the blow; nevertheless it grazed on my\r\nshoulder, takes me away six purls of an Italian cut-work band I wore,\r\ncost me three pounds in the Exchange but three days before.\r\n\r\n"_Punt_. This was a strange encounter.\r\n\r\n"_Fast_. Nay, you shall hear, sir. With this, we both fell out and\r\nbreathed. Now, upon the second sign of his assault, I betook me to my\r\nformer manner of defence; he, on the other side, abandoned his body to\r\nthe same danger as before, and follows me still with blows; but I, being\r\nloath to take the deadly advantage that lay before me of his left side,\r\nmade a kind of stramazoun, ran him up to the hilt through the doublet,\r\nthrough the shirt, and yet missed the skin. He, making a reverse blow,\r\nfalls upon my embossed girdle,--I had thrown off the hangers a little\r\nbefore,--strikes off a skirt of a thick-laced satin doublet I had, lined\r\nwith four taffetas, cuts off two panes embroidered with pearl, rends\r\nthrough the drawings-out of tissue, enters the linings, and spiks the\r\nflesh.\r\n\r\n"_Car_. I wonder he speaks not of his wrought shirt.\r\n\r\n"_Fast_. Here, in the opinion of mutual damage, we paused. But, ere\r\nI proceed, I must tell you, signior, that in the last encounter, not\r\nhaving leisure to put off my silver spurs, one of the rowels catched\r\nhold of the ruffles of my boot, and, being Spanish leather and subject\r\nto tear, overthrows me, rends me two pair of silk stockings that I put\r\non, being somewhat of a raw morning, a peach colour and another, and\r\nstrikes me some half-inch deep into the side of the calf: He, seeing the\r\nblood come, presently takes horse and away; I having bound up my wound\r\nwith a piece of my wrought shirt--\r\n\r\n"_Car_. O, comes it in there.\r\n\r\n"_Fast_. Ride after him, and, lighting at the court gate both together,\r\nembraced, and marched hand in hand up into the presence. Was not this\r\nbusiness well carried?\r\n\r\n"_Maci_. Well! yes; and by this we can guess what apparel the gentleman\r\nwore.\r\n\r\n"_Punt_. \'Fore valour! it was a designment begun with much resolution,\r\nmaintained with as much prowess, and ended with more humanity."]\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay," said the monk, muttering as he went up the winding stair,\r\n"carry him his trumpery with all despatch. Alas! that man, with so many\r\nnoble objects of pursuit, will amuse himself like a jackanape, with a\r\nlaced jerkin and a cap and bells!--I must now to the melancholy work of\r\nconsoling that which is well-nigh inconsolable, a mother weeping for her\r\nfirst-born."\r\n\r\nAdvancing, after a gentle knock, into the apartment of the women, he\r\nfound that Mary Avenel had retired to bed, extremely indisposed, and\r\nthat Dame Glendinning and Tibb were indulging their sorrows by the side\r\nof a decaying fire, and by the light of a small iron lamp, or cruize,\r\nas it was termed. Poor Elspeth\'s apron was thrown over her head, and\r\nbitterly did she sob and weep for "her beautiful, her brave,--the very\r\nimage of her dear Simon Glendinning, the stay of her widowhood and the\r\nsupport of her old age."\r\n\r\nThe faithful Tibb echoed her complaints, and, more violently clamorous,\r\nmade deep promises of revenge on Sir Piercie Shafton, "if there were a\r\nman left in the south who could draw a whinger, or a woman that could\r\nthraw a rape." The presence of the Sub-Prior imposed silence on these\r\nclamours. He sate down by the unfortunate mother, and essayed, by such\r\ntopics as his religion and reason suggested, to interrupt the current of\r\nDame Glendinning\'s feelings; but the attempt was in vain. She listened,\r\nindeed, with some little interest, while he pledged his word and\r\nhis influence with the Abbot, that the family which had lost their\r\neldest-born by means of a guest received at his command, should\r\nexperience particular protection at the hands of the community; and\r\nthat the fief which belonged to Simon Glendinning should, with extended\r\nbounds and added privileges, be conferred on Edward.\r\n\r\nBut it was only for a very brief space that the mother\'s sobs were\r\napparently softer, and her grief more mild. She soon blamed herself\r\nfor casting a moment\'s thought upon world\'s gear while poor Halbert\r\nwas lying stretched in his bloody shirt. The Sub-Prior was not more\r\nfortunate, when he promised that Halbert\'s body "should be removed to\r\nhallowed ground, and his soul secured by the prayers of the Church in\r\nhis behalf." Grief would have its natural course, and the voice of the\r\ncomforter was wasted in vain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter the Twenty-Eighth.\r\n\r\n\r\n  He is at liberty, I have ventured for him!\r\n  -----------------------------if the law\r\n  Find and condemn me for\'t, some living wenches,\r\n  Some honest-hearted maids will sing my dirge,\r\n  And tell to memory my death was noble,\r\n  Dying almost a martyr.\r\n                            THE TWO NOBLE KINSMEN.\r\n\r\nThe Sub-Prior of Saint Mary\'s, in taking his departure from the spence\r\nwhich Sir Piercie Shafton was confined, and in which some preparations\r\nwere made for his passing the night as the room which might be most\r\nconveniently guarded, left more than one perplexed person behind him.\r\nThere was connected with this chamber, and opening into it, a small\r\n_outshot_, or projecting part of the building, occupied by a sleeping\r\napartment, which upon ordinary occasions, was that of Mary Avenel, and\r\nwhich, in the unusual number of guests who had come to the tower on\r\nthe former evening, had also accommodated Mysie Happer, the Miller\'s\r\ndaughter; for anciently, as well as in the present day, a Scottish house\r\nwas always rather too narrow and limited for the extent of the owner\'s\r\nhospitality, and some shift and contrivance was necessary, upon any\r\nunusual occasion, to ensure the accommodation of all the guests.\r\n\r\nThe fatal news of Halbert Glendinning\'s death had thrown all former\r\narrangements into confusion. Mary Avenel, whose case required immediate\r\nattention, had been transported into the apartment hitherto occupied by\r\nHalbert and his brother, as the latter proposed to watch all night,\r\nin order to prevent the escape of the prisoner. Poor Mysie had been\r\naltogether overlooked, and had naturally enough betaken herself to the\r\nlittle apartment which she had hitherto occupied, ignorant that the\r\nspence, through which lay the only access to it, was to be the sleeping\r\nchamber of Sir Piercie Shafton. The measures taken for securing him\r\nthere had been so sudden, that she was not aware of it, until she\r\nfound that the other females had been removed from the spence by\r\nthe Sub-Prior\'s direction, and having once missed the opportunity of\r\nretreating along with them, bashfulness, and the high respect which she\r\nwas taught to bear to the monks, prevented her venturing forth alone,\r\nand intruding herself on the presence of Father Eustace, while in secret\r\nconference with the Southron. There appeared no remedy but to wait till\r\ntheir interview was over; and, as the door was thin, and did not shut\r\nvery closely, she could hear every word that passed betwixt them.\r\n\r\nIt thus happened, that without any intended intrusion on her part, she\r\nbecame privy to the whole conversation of the Sub-Prior and the English\r\nknight, and could also observe from the window of her little retreat,\r\nthat more than one of the young men summoned by Edward arrived\r\nsuccessively at the tower. These circumstances led her to entertain most\r\nserious apprehension that the life of Sir Piercie Shafton was in great\r\nand instant peril.\r\n\r\nWoman is naturally compassionate, and not less willingly so when youth\r\nand fair features are on the side of him who claims her sympathy. The\r\nhandsome presence, elaborate dress and address, of Sir Piercie Shafton,\r\nwhich had failed to make any favorable impression on the grave and lofty\r\ncharacter of Mary Avenel, had completely dazzled and bewildered the poor\r\nMaid of the Mill. The knight had perceived this result, and, flattered\r\nby seeing that his merit was not universally underrated, he had bestowed\r\non Mysie a good deal more of his courtesy than in his opinion her rank\r\nwarranted. It was not cast away, but received with a devout sense of his\r\ncondescension, and with gratitude for his personal notice, which,\r\njoined to her fears for his safety, and the natural tenderness of her\r\ndisposition, began to make wild work in her heart.\r\n\r\n"To be sure it was very wrong in him to slay Halbert Glendinning," (it\r\nwas thus she argued the case with herself,) "but then he was a gentleman\r\nborn, and a soldier, and so gentle and courteous withal, that she was\r\nsure the quarrel had been all of young Glendinning\'s own seeking; for\r\nit was well known that both these lads were so taken up with that Mary\r\nAvenel, that they never looked at another lass in the Halidome, more\r\nthan if they were of a different degree. And then Halbert\'s dress was\r\nas clownish as his manners were haughty; and this poor young gentleman,\r\n(who was habited like any prince,) banished from his own land, was first\r\ndrawn into a quarrel by a rude brangler, and then persecuted and like to\r\nbe put to death by his kin and allies."\r\n\r\nMysie wept bitterly at the thought, and then her heart rising against\r\nsuch cruelty and oppression to a defenceless stranger, who dressed\r\nwith so much skill, and spoke with so much grace, she began to consider\r\nwhether she could not render him some assistance in this extremity.\r\n\r\nHer mind was now entirely altered from its original purpose. At first\r\nher only anxiety had been to find the means of escaping from the\r\ninterior apartment, without being noticed by any one; but now she began\r\nto think that Heaven had placed her there for the safety and protection\r\nof the persecuted stranger. She was of a simple and affectionate, but at\r\nthe same time an alert and enterprising character, possessing more\r\nthan female strength of body, and more than female courage, though with\r\nfeelings as capable of being bewildered with gallantry of dress and\r\nlanguage, as a fine gentleman of any generation would have desired to\r\nexercise his talents upon. "I will save him," she thought, "that is the\r\nfirst thing to be resolved--and then I wonder what he will say to the\r\npoor Miller\'s maiden, that has done for him what all the dainty dames in\r\nLondon or Holyrood would have been afraid to venture upon."\r\n\r\nPrudence began to pull her sleeve as she indulged speculations so\r\nhazardous, and hinted to her that the warmer Sir Piercie Shafton\'s\r\ngratitude might prove, it was the more likely to be fraught with danger\r\nto his benefactress. Alas! poor Prudence, thou mayest say with our moral\r\nteacher,\r\n\r\n  "I preach for ever, but I preach in vain."\r\n\r\nThe Miller\'s maiden, while you pour your warning into her unwilling\r\nbosom, has glanced her eye on the small mirror by which she has placed\r\nher little lamp, and it returns to her a countenance and eyes, pretty\r\nand sparkling at all times, but ennobled at present with the energy of\r\nexpression proper to those who have dared to form, and stand prepared\r\nto execute, deeds of generous audacity. "Will these features--will\r\nthese eyes, joined to the benefit I am about to confer upon Sir Piercie\r\nShafton, do nothing towards removing the distance of rank between us?"\r\n\r\nSuch was the question which female vanity asked of fancy; and though\r\neven fancy dared not answer in a ready affirmative, a middle conclusion\r\nwas adopted--"Let me first succour the gallant youth, and trust to\r\nfortune for the rest."\r\n\r\nBanishing, therefore, from her mind every thing that was personal to\r\nherself, the rash but generous girl turned her whole thoughts to the\r\nmeans of executing this enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties which interposed were of no ordinary nature. The\r\nvengeance of the men of that country, in cases of deadly feud, that\r\nis, in cases of a quarrel excited by the slaughter of any of their\r\nrelations, was one of their most marked characteristics; and Edward,\r\nhowever gentle in other respects, was so fond of his brother, that\r\nthere could be no doubt that he would be as signal in his revenge as\r\nthe customs of the country authorized. There were to be passed the inner\r\ndoor of the apartment, the two gates of the tower itself, and the gate\r\nof the court-yard, ere the prisoner was at liberty; and then a guide\r\nand means of flight were to be provided, otherwise ultimate escape\r\nwas impossible. But where the will of woman is strongly bent on\r\nthe accomplishment of such a purpose, her wit is seldom baffled by\r\ndifficulties, however embarrassing.\r\n\r\nThe Sub-Prior had not long left the apartment, ere Mysie had devised a\r\nscheme for Sir Piercie Shafton\'s freedom, daring, indeed, but likely to\r\nbe successful, if dexterously conducted. It was necessary, however, that\r\nshe should remain where she was till so late an hour, that all in the\r\ntower should have betaken themselves to repose, excepting those whose\r\nduty made them watchers. The interval she employed in observing\r\nthe movements of the person in whose service she was thus boldly a\r\nvolunteer.\r\n\r\nShe could hear Sir Piercie Shafton pace the floor to and fro, in\r\nreflection doubtless on his own untoward fate and precarious situation.\r\nBy and by she heard him making a rustling among his trunks, which,\r\nagreeable to the order of the Sub-Prior, had been placed in the\r\napartment to which he was confined, and which he was probably amusing\r\nmore melancholy thoughts by examining and arranging. Then she could hear\r\nhim resume his walk through the room, and, as if his spirits had been\r\nsomewhat relieved and elevated by the survey of his wardrobe, she could\r\ndistinguish that at one turn he half recited a sonnet, at another half\r\nwhistled a galliard, and at the third hummed a saraband. At length she\r\ncould understand that he extended himself on the temporary couch which\r\nhad been allotted to him, after muttering his prayers hastily, and in a\r\nshort time she concluded he must be fast asleep.\r\n\r\nShe employed the moment which intervened in considering her enterprise\r\nunder every different aspect; and dangerous as it was, the steady review\r\nwhich she took of the various perils accompanying her purpose, furnished\r\nher with plausible devices for obviating them. Love and generous\r\ncompassion, which give singly such powerful impulse to the female heart,\r\nwere in this case united, and championed her to the last extremity of\r\nhazard.\r\n\r\nIt was an hour past midnight. All in the tower slept sound but those who\r\nhad undertaken to guard the English prisoner; or if sorrow and suffering\r\ndrove sleep from the bed of Dame Glendinning and her foster-daughter,\r\nthey were too much wrapt in their own griefs to attend to external\r\nsounds. The means of striking light were at hand in the small apartment,\r\nand thus the Miller\'s maiden was enabled to light and trim a small lamp.\r\nWith a trembling step and throbbing heart, she undid the door which\r\nseparated her from the apartment in which the Southron knight was\r\nconfined, and almost flinched from her fixed purpose, when she found\r\nherself in the same room with the sleeping prisoner. She scarcely\r\ntrusted herself to look upon him, as he lay wrapped in his cloak, and\r\nfast asleep upon the pallet bed, but turned her eyes away while she\r\ngently pulled his mantle with no more force than was just equal to\r\nawaken him. He moved not until she had twitched his cloak a second and\r\na third time, and then at length looking up, was about to make an\r\nexclamation in the suddenness of his surprise.\r\n\r\nMysie\'s bashfulness was conquered by her fear. She placed her fingers\r\non her lips, in token that he must observe the most strict silence, and\r\nthen pointed to the door to intimate that it was watched.\r\n\r\nSir Piercie Shafton now collected himself and sat upright on his couch.\r\nHe gazed with surprise on the graceful figure of the young woman who\r\nstood before him; her well-formed person, her flowing hair, and the\r\noutline of her features, showed dimly, and yet to advantage, by the\r\npartial and feeble light which she held in her hand. The romantic\r\nimagination of the gallant would soon have coined some compliment proper\r\nfor the occasion, but Mysie left him not time.\r\n\r\n"I come," she said, "to save your life, which is else in great peril--if\r\nyou answer me, speak as low as you can, for they have sentinelled your\r\ndoor with armed men."\r\n\r\n"Comeliest of miller\'s daughters," answered Sir Piercie, who by this\r\ntime was sitting upright on his couch, "dread nothing for my safety.\r\nCredit me, that, as in very truth, I have not spilled the red puddle\r\n(which these villagios call the blood) of their most uncivil relation,\r\nso I am under no apprehension whatever for the issue of this restraint,\r\nseeing that it cannot but be harmless to me. Natheless, to thee, O most\r\nMolendinar beauty, I return the thanks which thy courtesy may justly\r\nclaim."\r\n\r\n"Nay, but, Sir Knight," answered the maiden, in a whisper as low as it\r\nwas tremulous, "I deserve no thanks unless you will act by my counsel.\r\nEdward Glendinning hath sent for Dan of the Howlet-hirst, and young Adie\r\nof Aikenshaw, and they are come with three men more, and with bow, and\r\njack, and spear, and I heard them say to each other, and to Edward, as\r\nthey alighted in the court, that they would have amends for the death of\r\ntheir kinsman, if the monk\'s cowl should smoke for it--And the vassals\r\nare so wilful now, that the Abbot himself dare not control them, for\r\nfear they turn heretics, and refuse to pay their feu-duties."\r\n\r\n"In faith," said Sir Piercie Shafton, "it may be a shrewd temptation,\r\nand perchance the monks may rid themselves of trouble and cumber,\r\nby handing me over the march to Sir John Foster or Lord Hundson, the\r\nEnglish wardens, and so make peace with their vassals and with England\r\nat once. Fairest Molinara, I will for once walk by thy rede, and if thou\r\ndost contrive to extricate me from this vile kennel, I will so celebrate\r\nthy wit and beauty, that the Baker\'s nymph of Raphael d\'Urbino shall\r\nseem but a gipsey in comparison of my Molinara."\r\n\r\n"I pray you, then, be silent," said the Miller\'s daughter; "for if your\r\nspeech betrays that you are awake, my scheme fails utterly, and it is\r\nHeaven\'s mercy and Our Lady\'s that we are not already overheard and\r\ndiscovered."\r\n\r\n"I am silent," replied the Southron, "even as the starless night--but\r\nyet--if this contrivance of thine should endanger thy safety, fair and\r\nno less kind than fair damsel, it were utterly unworthy of me to accept\r\nit at thy hand."\r\n\r\n"Do not think of me," said Mysie, hastily; "I am safe--I will take\r\nthought for myself, if I once saw you out of this dangerous dwelling--if\r\nyou would provide yourself with any part of your apparel or goods, lose\r\nno time."\r\n\r\nThe knight _did_, however, lose some time, ere he could settle in his\r\nown mind what to take and what to abandon of his wardrobe, each article\r\nof which seemed endeared to him by recollection of the feasts and revels\r\nat which it had been exhibited. For some little while Mysie left him\r\nto make his selections at leisure, for she herself had also some\r\npreparations to make for flight. But when, returning from the chamber\r\ninto which she had retired, with a small bundle in her hand, she found\r\nhim still indecisive, she insisted in plain terms, that he should either\r\nmake up his baggage for the enterprise, or give it up entirely. Thus\r\nurged, the disconsolate knight hastily made up a few clothes into a\r\nbundle, regarded his trunk-mails with a mute expression of parting\r\nsorrow, and intimated his readiness to wait upon his kind guide.\r\n\r\nShe led the way to the door of the apartment, having first carefully\r\nextinguished her lamp, and motioning to the knight to stand close behind\r\nher, tapped once or twice at the door. She was at length answered by\r\nEdward Glendinning, who demanded to know who knocked within, and what\r\nwas desired.\r\n\r\n"Speak low," said Mysie Happer, "or you will awaken the English knight.\r\nIt is I, Mysie Happer, who knock--I wish to get out--you have locked me\r\nup--and I was obliged to wait till the Southron slept."\r\n\r\n"Locked you up!" replied Edward, in surprise.\r\n\r\n"Yes," answered the Miller\'s daughter, "you have locked me up into this\r\nroom--I was in Mary Avenel\'s sleeping apartment."\r\n\r\n"And can you not remain there till morning," replied Edward, "since it\r\nhas so chanced?"\r\n\r\n"What!" said the Miller\'s daughter, in a tone of offended delicacy, "I\r\nremain here a moment longer than I can get out without discovery!--I\r\nwould not, for all the Halidome of St. Mary\'s, remain a minute longer in\r\nthe neighbourhood of a man\'s apartment than I can help it--For whom,\r\nor for what do you hold me? I promise you my father\'s daughter has been\r\nbetter brought up than to put in peril her good name."\r\n\r\n"Come forth then, and get to thy chamber in silence," said Edward. So\r\nsaying, he undid the bolt. The staircase without was in utter darkness,\r\nas Mysie had before ascertained. So soon as she stept out, she took hold\r\nof Edward as if to support herself, thus interposing her person betwixt\r\nhim and Sir Piercie Shaffcon, by whom she was closely followed. Thus\r\nscreened from observation, the Englishman slipped past on tiptoe, unshod\r\nand in silence, while the damsel complained to Edward that she wanted a\r\nlight.\r\n\r\n"I cannot get you a light," said he, "for I cannot leave this post; but\r\nthere is a fire below."\r\n\r\n"I will sit below till morning," said the Maid of the Mill; and,\r\ntripping down stairs, heard Edward bolt and bar the door of the now\r\ntenantless apartment with vain caution.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the stair which she descended, she found the object of\r\nher care waiting her farther directions. She recommended to him the most\r\nabsolute silence, which, for once in his life, he seemed not unwilling\r\nto observe, conducted him, with as much caution as if he were walking on\r\ncracked ice, to a dark recess, used for depositing wood, and instructed\r\nhim to ensconce himself behind the fagots. She herself lighted her lamp\r\nonce more at the kitchen fire, and took her distaff and spindle, that\r\nshe might not seem to be unemployed, in case any one came into the\r\napartment.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time, however, she stole towards the window on tiptoe, to\r\ncatch the first glance of the dawn, for the farther prosecution of her\r\nadventurous project. At length she saw, to her great joy, the first peep\r\nof the morning brighten upon the gray clouds of the east, and, clasping\r\nher hands together, thanked Our Lady for the sight, and implored\r\nprotection during the remainder of her enterprise. Ere she had finished\r\nher prayer, she started at feeling a man\'s arm across her shoulder,\r\nwhile a rough voice spoke in her ear--"What! menseful Mysie of the Mill\r\nso soon at her prayers?--now, benison on the bonny eyes that open so\r\nearly!--I\'ll have a kiss for good morrow\'s sake."\r\n\r\nDan of the Howlet-hirst, for he was the gallant who paid Mysie this\r\ncompliment, suited the action with the word, and the action, as is usual\r\nin such cases of rustic gallantry, was rewarded with a cuff, which\r\nDan received as a fine gentleman receives a tap with a fan, but which,\r\ndelivered by the energetic arm of the Miller\'s maiden, would have\r\ncertainly astonished a less robust gallant.\r\n\r\n"How now, Sir Coxcomb!" said she, "and must you be away from your guard\r\nover the English knight, to plague quiet folks with your horse-tricks!"\r\n\r\n"Truly you are mistaken, pretty Mysie," said the clown, "for I have not\r\nyet relieved Edward at his post; and were it not a shame to let him stay\r\nany longer, by my faith, I could find it in my heart not to quit you\r\nthese two hours."\r\n\r\n"Oh, you have hours and hours enough to see any one," said Mysie; "but\r\nyou must think of the distress of the household even now, and get Edward\r\nto sleep for a while, for he has kept watch this whole night."\r\n\r\n"I will have another kiss first," answered Dan of the Howlet-hirst.\r\n\r\nBut Mysie was now on her guard, and, conscious of the vicinity of the\r\nwood-hole, offered such strenuous resistance, that the swain cursed the\r\nnymph\'s bad humour with very unpastoral phrase and emphasis, and ran up\r\nstairs to relieve the guard of his comrade. Stealing to the door, she\r\nheard the new sentinel hold a brief conversation with Edward, after\r\nwhich the latter withdrew, and the former entered upon the duties of his\r\nwatch.\r\n\r\nMysie suffered him to walk there a little while undisturbed, until the\r\ndawning became more general, by which time she supposed he might have\r\ndigested her coyness, and then presenting herself before the watchful\r\nsentinel, demanded of him "the keys of the outer tower, and of the\r\ncourtyard gate."\r\n\r\n"And for what purpose?" answered the warder.\r\n\r\n"To milk the cows, and drive them out to their pasture," said Mysie;\r\n"you would not have the poor beasts kept in the byre a\' morning, and the\r\nfamily in such distress, that there is na ane fit to do a turn but the\r\nbyre-woman and myself?"\r\n\r\n"And where is the byre-woman?" said Dan.\r\n\r\n"Sitting with me in the kitchen, in case these distressed folks want any\r\nthing."\r\n\r\n"There are the keys, then, Mysie Dorts," said the sentinel.\r\n\r\n"Many thanks, Dan Ne\'er-do-weel," answered the Maid of the Mill, and\r\nescaped down stairs in a moment.\r\n\r\nTo hasten to the wood-hole, and there to robe the English knight in a\r\nshort gown and petticoat, which she had provided for the purpose, was\r\nthe work of another moment. She then undid the gates of the tower, and\r\nmade towards the byre, or cow-house, which stood in one corner of the\r\ncourtyard. Sir Piercie Shafton remonstrated against the delay which this\r\nwould occasion.\r\n\r\n"Fair and generous Molinara," he said, "had we not better undo the\r\noutward gate, and make the best of our way hence, even like a pair of\r\nsea-mews who make towards shelter of the rocks as the storm waxes high?"\r\n\r\n"We must drive out the cows first," said Mysie, "for a sin it were to\r\nspoil the poor widow\'s cattle, both for her sake and the poor beasts\'\r\nown; and I have no mind any one shall leave the tower in a hurry to\r\nfollow us. Besides, you must have your horse, for you will need a fleet\r\none ere all be done."\r\n\r\nSo saying, she locked and double-locked both the inward and outward door\r\nof the tower, proceeded to the cow-house, turned out the cattle, and,\r\ngiving the knight his own horse to lead, drove them before her out at\r\nthe court-yard gate, intending to return for her own palfrey. But the\r\nnoise attending the first operation caught the wakeful attention of\r\nEdward, who, starting to the bartizan, called to know what the matter\r\nwas.\r\n\r\nMysie answered with great readiness, that "she was driving out the cows,\r\nfor that they would be spoiled for want of looking to."\r\n\r\n"I thank thee, kind maiden," said Edward--"and yet," he added, after a\r\nmoment\'s pause, "what damsel is that thou hast with thee?"\r\n\r\nMysie was about to answer, when Sir Piercie Shafton, who apparently\r\ndid not desire that the great work of his liberation should be executed\r\nwithout the interposition of his own ingenuity, exclaimed from beneath,\r\n"I am she, O most bucolical juvenal, under whose charge are placed the\r\nmilky mothers of the herd."\r\n\r\n"Hell and darkness!" exclaimed Edward, in a transport of fury\r\nand astonishment, "it is Piercie Shafton--What! treason!\r\ntreason!--ho!--Dan--Jasper--Martin--the villain escapes!"\r\n\r\n"To horse! to horse!" cried Mysie, and in an instant mounted behind the\r\nknight, who was already in the saddle.\r\n\r\nEdward caught up a cross-bow, and let fly a bolt, which whistled so\r\nnear Mysie\'s ear, that she called to her companion,--"Spur--spur, Sir\r\nKnight!--the next will not miss us.--Had it been Halbert instead of\r\nEdward who bent that bow, we had been dead."\r\n\r\nThe knight pressed his horse, which dashed past the cows, and down the\r\nknoll on which the tower was situated. Then taking the road down the\r\nvalley, the gallant animal, reckless of its double burden, soon conveyed\r\nthem out of hearing of the tumult and alarm with which their departure\r\nfilled the Tower of Glendearg.\r\n\r\nThus it strangely happened, that two men were flying in different\r\ndirections at the same time, each accused of being the other\'s murderer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter the Twenty-Ninth.\r\n\r\n\r\n  -------------Sure he cannot\r\n  Be so unmanly as to leave me here;\r\n  If he do, maids will not so easily\r\n  Trust men again.\r\n                  THE TWO NOBLE KINSMEN.\r\n\r\nThe knight continued to keep the good horse at a pace as quick as the\r\nroad permitted, until they had cleared the valley of Glendearg, and\r\nentered upon the broad dale of the Tweed, which now rolled before\r\nthem in crystal beauty, displaying on its opposite bank the huge gray\r\nMonastery of St. Mary\'s, whose towers and pinnacles were scarce yet\r\ntouched by the newly-risen sun, so deeply the edifice lies shrouded\r\nunder the mountains which rise to the southward.\r\n\r\nTurning to the left, the knight continued his road down to the northern\r\nbank of the river, until they arrived nearly opposite to the weir,\r\nor dam-dike, where Father Philip concluded his extraordinary aquatic\r\nexcursion.\r\n\r\nSir Piercie Shafton, whose brain seldom admitted more than one idea at\r\na time, had hitherto pushed forward without very distinctly considering\r\nwhere he was going. But the sight of the Monastery so near to him,\r\nreminded, him that he was still on dangerous ground, and that he must\r\nnecessarily provide for his safety by choosing some settled plan of\r\nescape. The situation of his guide and deliverer also occurred to him,\r\nfor he was far from being either selfish or ungrateful. He listened, and\r\ndiscovered that the Miller\'s daughter was sobbing and weeping bitterly\r\nas she rested her head on his shoulder.\r\n\r\n"What ails thee," he said, "my generous Molinara?--is there aught that\r\nPiercie Shafton can do which may show his gratitude to his deliverer?"\r\nMysie pointed with her finger across the river, but ventured not to\r\nturn her eyes in that direction. "Nay, but speak plain, most generous\r\ndamsel," said the knight, who, for once, was puzzled as much as his own\r\nelegance of speech was wont to puzzle others, "for I swear to you that I\r\ncomprehend nought by the extension of thy fair digit."\r\n\r\n"Yonder is my father\'s house," said Mysie, in a voice interrupted by the\r\nincreased burst of her sorrow.\r\n\r\n"And I was carrying thee discourteously to a distance from thy\r\nhabitation?" said Shafton, imagining he had found out the source of her\r\ngrief. "Wo worth the hour that Piercie Shafton, in attention to his own\r\nsafety, neglected the accommodation of any female, far less of his most\r\nbeneficent liberatrice! Dismount, then, O lovely Molinara, unless thou\r\nwouldst rather that I should transport thee on horseback to the house of\r\nthy molendinary father, which, if thou sayest the word, I am prompt to\r\ndo, defying all dangers which may arise to me personally, whether by\r\nmonk or miller."\r\n\r\nMysie suppressed her sobs, and with considerable difficulty muttered her\r\ndesire to alight, and take her fortune by herself. Sir Piercie Shafton,\r\ntoo devoted a squire of dames to consider the most lowly as exempted\r\nfrom a respectful attention, independent of the claims which the\r\nMiller\'s maiden possessed over him, dismounted instantly from his horse,\r\nand received in his arms the poor girl, who still wept bitterly, and,\r\nwhen placed on the ground, seemed scarce able to support herself, or at\r\nleast still clung, though, as it appeared, unconsciously, to the support\r\nhe had afforded. He carried her to a weeping birch tree, which grew on\r\nthe green-sward bank around which the road winded, and, placing her on\r\nthe ground beneath it, exhorted her to compose herself. A strong touch\r\nof natural feeling struggled with, and half overcame, his acquired\r\naffectation, while he said, "Credit me, most generous damsel, the\r\nservice you have done to Piercie Shafton he would have deemed too dearly\r\nbought, had he foreseen it was to cost you these tears and singults.\r\nShow me the cause of your grief, and if I can do aught to remove\r\nit, believe that the rights you have acquired over me will make your\r\ncommands sacred as those of an empress. Speak, then, fair Molinara,\r\nand command him whom fortune hath rendered at once your debtor and your\r\nchampion. What are your orders?"\r\n\r\n"Only that you will fly and save yourself," said Mysie, mustering up her\r\nutmost efforts to utter these few words.\r\n\r\n"Yet," said the knight, "let me not leave you without some token of\r\nremembrance." Mysie would have said there needed none, and most truly\r\nwould she have spoken, could she have spoken for weeping. "Piercie\r\nShafton is poor," he continued, "but let this chain testify he is not\r\nungrateful to his deliverer."\r\n\r\nHe took from his neck the rich chain and medallion we have formerly\r\nmentioned, and put it into the powerless hand of the poor maiden,\r\nwho neither received nor rejected it, but, occupied with more intense\r\nfeelings, seemed scarce aware of what he was doing.\r\n\r\n"We shall meet again," said Sir Piercie Shafton, "at least I trust so;\r\nmeanwhile, weep no more, fair Molinara, an thou lovest me."\r\n\r\nThe phrase of conjuration was but used as an ordinary commonplace\r\nexpression of the time, but bore a deeper sense to poor Mysie\'s ear.\r\nShe dried her tears; and when the knight, in all kind and chivalrous\r\ncourtesy, stooped to embrace her at their parting, she rose humbly up to\r\nreceive the proffered honour in a posture of more deference, and meekly\r\nand gratefully accepted the offered salute. Sir Piercie Shafton mounted\r\nhis horse, and began to ride off, but curiosity, or perhaps a stronger\r\nfeeling, soon induced him to look back, when he beheld the Miller\'s\r\ndaughter standing still motionless on the spot where they had parted,\r\nher eyes turned after him, and the unheeded chain hanging from her hand.\r\n\r\nIt was at this moment that a glimpse of the real state of Mysie\'s\r\naffections, and of the motive from which she had acted in the whole\r\nmatter, glanced on Sir Piercie Shafton\'s mind. The gallants of that age,\r\ndisinterested, aspiring, and lofty-minded, even in their coxcombry, were\r\nstrangers to those degrading and mischievous pursuits which are usually\r\ntermed low amours. They did not "chase the humble maidens of the plain,"\r\nor degrade their own rank, to deprive rural innocence of peace and\r\nvirtue. It followed, of course, that as conquests in this class were no\r\npart of their ambition, they were in most cases totally overlooked and\r\nunsuspected, left unimproved, as a modern would call it, where, as\r\non the present occasion, they were casually made. The companion of\r\nAstrophel, and flower of the tilt-yard of Feliciana, had no more idea\r\nthat his graces and good parts could attach the love of Mysie Happer,\r\nthan a first-rate beauty in the boxes dreams of the fatal wound which\r\nher charms may inflict on some attorney\'s romantic apprentice in the\r\npit. I suppose, in any ordinary case, the pride of rank and distinction\r\nwould have pronounced on the humble admirer the doom which Beau Fielding\r\ndenounced against the whole female world, "Let them look and die;" but\r\nthe obligations under which he lay to the enamoured maiden, miller\'s\r\ndaughter as she was, precluded the possibility of Sir Piercie\'s treating\r\nthe matter _en cavalier_, and, much embarrassed, yet a little flattered\r\nat the same time, he rode back to try what could be done for the\r\ndamsel\'s relief.\r\n\r\nThe innate modesty of poor Mysie could not prevent her showing too\r\nobvious signs of joy at Sir Piercie Shafton\'s return. She was betrayed\r\nby the sparkle of the rekindling eye, and a caress which, however\r\ntimidly bestowed, she could not help giving to the neck of the horse\r\nwhich brought back the beloved rider.\r\n\r\n"What farther can I do for you, kind Molinara?" said Sir Piercie\r\nShafton, himself hesitating and blushing; for, to the grace of Queen\r\nBess\'s age be it spoken, her courtiers wore more iron on their breasts\r\nthan brass on their foreheads, and even amid their vanities preserved\r\nstill the decaying spirit of chivalry, which inspired of yore the very\r\ngentle Knight of Chaucer,\r\n\r\n     Who in his port was modest as a maid.\r\n\r\nMysie blushed deeply, with her eyes fixed on the ground, and Sir Piercie\r\nproceeded in the same tone of embarrassed kindness. "Are you afraid to\r\nreturn home alone, my kind Molinara?--would you that I should accompany\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\n"Alas!" said Mysie, looking up, and her cheek changing from scarlet to\r\npale, "I have no home left."\r\n\r\n"How! no home!" said Shafton; "says my generous Molinara she hath no\r\nhome, when yonder stands the house of her father, and but a crystal\r\nstream between?"\r\n\r\n\r\n"Alas!" answered the Miller\'s maiden, "I have no longer either home or\r\nfather. He is a devoted servant to the Abbey--I have offended the Abbot,\r\nand if I return home my father will kill me."\r\n\r\n"He dare not injure thee, by Heaven!" said Sir Piercie; "I swear to\r\nthee, by my honour and knighthood, that the forces of my cousin of\r\nNorthumberland shall lay the Monastery so flat, that a horse shall not\r\nstumble as he rides over it, if they should dare to injure a hair of\r\nyour head! Therefore be hopeful and content, kind Mysinda, and know you\r\nhave obliged one who can and will avenge the slightest wrong offered to\r\nyou."\r\n\r\nHe sprung from his horse as he spoke, and, in the animation of his\r\nargument, grasped the willing hand of Mysie, (or Mysinda as he had now\r\nchristened her.) He gazed too upon full black eyes, fixed upon his own\r\nwith an expression which, however subdued by maidenly shame, it was\r\nimpossible to mistake, on cheeks where something like hope began to\r\nrestore the natural colour, and on two lips which, like double rosebuds,\r\nwere kept a little apart by expectation, and showed within a line of\r\nteeth as white as pearl. All this was dangerous to look upon, and Sir.\r\nPiercie Shafton, after repeating with less and less force his request\r\nthat the fair Mysinda would allow him to carry her to her father\'s,\r\nended by asking the fair Mysinda to go along with him--"At least," he\r\nadded, "until I shall be able to conduct you to a place of safety."\r\n\r\nMysie Happer made no answer; but blushing scarlet betwixt joy and shame,\r\nmutely expressed her willingness to accompany the Southron Knight,\r\nby knitting her bundle closer, and preparing to resume her seat _en\r\ncroupe_. "And what is your pleasure that I should do with this?" she\r\nsaid, holding up the chain as if she had been for the first time aware\r\nthat it was in her hand.\r\n\r\n"Keep it, fairest Mysinda, for my sake," said the Knight.\r\n\r\n"Not so, sir," answered Mysie, gravely; "the maidens of my country take\r\nno such gifts from their superiors, and I need no token to remind me of\r\nthis morning."\r\n\r\nMost earnestly and courteously did the Knight urge her acceptance of\r\nthe proposed guerdon, but on this point Mysie was resolute; feeling,\r\nperhaps, that to accept of any thing bearing the appearance of reward,\r\nwould be to place the service she had rendered him on a mercenary\r\nfooting. In short, she would only agree to conceal the chain, lest it\r\nmight prove the means of detecting the owner, until Sir Piercie should\r\nbe placed in perfect safety.\r\n\r\nThey mounted and resumed their journey, of which Mysie, as bold and\r\nsharp-witted in some points as she was simple and susceptible in others,\r\nnow took in some degree the direction, having only inquired its general\r\ndestination, and learned that Sir Piercie Shafton desired to go to\r\nEdinburgh, where he hoped to find friends and protection. Possessed of\r\nthis information, Mysie availed herself of her local knowledge to get as\r\nsoon as possible out of the bounds of the Halidome, and into those of a\r\ntemporal baron, supposed to be addicted to the reformed doctrines,\r\nand upon whose limits, at least, she thought their pursuers would not\r\nattempt to hazard any violence. She was not indeed very apprehensive of\r\na pursuit, reckoning with some confidence that the inhabitants of the\r\nTower of Glendearg would find it a matter of difficulty to surmount\r\nthe obstacles arising from their own bolts and bars, with which she had\r\ncarefully secured them before setting forth on the retreat.\r\n\r\nThey journeyed on, therefore, in tolerable security, and Sir Piercie\r\nShafton found leisure to amuse the time in high-flown speeches and long\r\nanecdotes of the court of Feliciana, to which Mysie bent an ear not a\r\nwhit less attentive, that she did not understand one word out of three\r\nwhich was uttered by her fellow-traveller. She listened, however, and\r\nadmired upon trust, as many a wise man has been contented to treat the\r\nconversation of a handsome but silly mistress. As for Sir Piercie,\r\nhe was in his element; and, well assured of the interest and full\r\napprobation of his auditor, he went on spouting Euphuism of more than\r\nusual obscurity, and at more than usual length. Thus passed the morning,\r\nand noon brought them within sight of a winding stream, on the side of\r\nwhich arose an ancient baronial castle, surrounded by some large trees.\r\nAt a small distance from the gate of the mansion, extended, as in those\r\ndays was usual, a straggling hamlet, having a church in the centre.\r\n\r\n"There are two hostelries in this Kirk-town," said Mysie, "but the worst\r\nis best for our purpose; for it stands apart from the other houses, and\r\nI ken the man weel, for he has dealt with my father for malt."\r\n\r\nThis _causa scientiae_, to use a lawyer\'s phrase, was ill chosen\r\nfor Mysie\'s purpose; for Sir Piercie Shafton had, by dint of his own\r\nloquacity, been talking himself all this while into a high esteem for\r\nhis fellow-traveller, and, pleased with the gracious reception which she\r\nafforded to his powers of conversation, had well-nigh forgotten that\r\nshe was not herself one of those high-born beauties of whom he was\r\nrecounting so many stories, when this unlucky speech at once placed\r\nthe most disadvantageous circumstances attending her lineage under his\r\nimmediate recollection. He said nothing, however. What indeed could\r\nhe say? Nothing was so natural as that a miller\'s daughter should be\r\nacquainted with publicans who dealt with her father for malt, and all\r\nthat was to be wondered at was the concurrence of events which had\r\nrendered such a female the companion and guide of Sir Piercie Shafton of\r\nWilverton, kinsman of the great Earl of Northumberland, whom princes\r\nand sovereigns themselves termed cousin, because of the Piercie blood.\r\n[Footnote: Froissart tells us somewhere, (the readers of romances are\r\nindifferent to accurate reference,) that the King of France called one\r\nof the Piercies cousin, because of the blood of Northumberland.] He felt\r\nthe disgrace of strolling through the country with a miller\'s maiden\r\non the crupper behind him, and was even ungrateful enough to feel some\r\nemotions of shame, when he halted his horse at the door of the little\r\ninn.\r\n\r\nBut the alert intelligence of Mysie Happer spared him farther sense of\r\nderogation, by instantly springing from his horse, and cramming the ears\r\nof mine host, who came out with his mouth agape to receive a guest of\r\nthe knight\'s appearance, with an imagined tale, in which circumstance on\r\ncircumstance were huddled so fast, as to astonish Sir Piercie Shafton,\r\nwhose own invention was none of the most brilliant. She explained to\r\nthe publican that this was a great English knight travelling from the\r\nMonastery to the court of Scotland, after having paid his vows to Saint\r\nMary, and that she had been directed to conduct him so far on the road;\r\nand that Ball, her palfrey, had fallen by the way, because he had been\r\nover-wrought with carrying home the last melder of meal to the portioner\r\nof Langhope; and that she had turned in Ball to graze in the Tasker\'s\r\npark, near Cripplecross, for he had stood as still as Lot\'s wife with\r\nvery weariness; and that the knight had courteously insisted she should\r\nride behind him, and that she had brought him to her kend friend\'s\r\nhostelry rather than to proud Peter Peddie\'s, who got his malt at\r\nthe Mellerstane mills; and that he must get the best that the house\r\nafforded, and that he must get it ready in a moment of time, and that\r\nshe was ready to help in the kitchen.\r\n\r\nAll this ran glibly off the tongue without pause on the part of\r\nMysie Happer, or doubt on that of the landlord. The guest\'s horse was\r\nconducted to the stable, and he himself installed in the cleanest\r\ncorner and best seat which the place afforded. Mysie, ever active and\r\nofficious, was at once engaged in preparing food, in spreading the\r\ntable, and in making all the better arrangements which her experience\r\ncould suggest, for the honour and comfort of her companion. He would\r\nfain have resisted this; for while it was impossible not to be gratified\r\nwith the eager and alert kindness which was so active in his service,\r\nhe felt an undefinable pain in seeing Mysinda engaged in these menial\r\nservices, and discharging them, moreover, as one to whom they were\r\nbut too familiar. Yet this jarring feeling was mixed with, and perhaps\r\nbalanced by, the extreme grace with which the neat-handed maiden\r\nexecuted these tasks, however mean in themselves, and gave to the\r\nwretched corner of a miserable inn of the period, the air of a bower,\r\nin which an enamoured fairy, or at least a shepherdess of Arcadia, was\r\ndisplaying, with unavailing solicitude, her designs on the heart of\r\nsome knight, destined by fortune to higher thoughts, and a more splendid\r\nunion.\r\n\r\nThe lightness and grace with which Mysie covered the little round table\r\nwith a snow-white cloth, and arranged upon it the hastily-roasted capon,\r\nwith its accompanying stoup of Bourdeaux, were but plebeian graces in\r\nthemselves; but yet there were very flattering ideas excited by each\r\nglance. She was so very well made, agile at once and graceful, with her\r\nhand and arm as white as snow, and her face in which a smile contended\r\nwith a blush, and her eyes which looked ever at Shafton when he looked\r\nelsewhere, and were dropped at once when they encountered his, that\r\nshe was irresistible! In fine, the affectionate delicacy of her whole\r\ndemeanour, joined to the promptitude and boldness she had so lately\r\nevinced, tended to ennoble the services she had rendered, as if some\r\n\r\n  -----sweet engaging Grace\r\n  Put on some clothes to come abroad,\r\n    And took a waiter\'s place.\r\n\r\nBut, on the other hand, came the damning reflection, that these duties\r\nwere not taught her by Love, to serve the beloved only, but arose from\r\nthe ordinary and natural habits of a miller\'s daughter, accustomed,\r\ndoubtless, to render the same service to every wealthier churl who\r\nfrequented her father\'s mill. This stopped the mouth of vanity, and of\r\nthe love which vanity had been hatching, as effectually as a peck of\r\nliteral flour would have done.\r\n\r\nAmidst this variety of emotions, Sir Piercie Shafton forgot not to ask\r\nthe object of them to sit down and partake the good cheer which she had\r\nbeen so anxious to provide and to place in order. He expected that\r\nthis invitation would have been bashfully, perhaps, but certainly most\r\nthankfully, accepted; but he was partly flattered, and partly piqued,\r\nby the mixture of deference and resolution with which Mysie declined his\r\ninvitation. Immediately after, she vanished from the apartment, leaving\r\nthe Euphuist to consider whether he was most gratified or displeased by\r\nher disappearance.\r\n\r\nIn fact, this was a point on which he would have found it difficult\r\nto make up his mind, had there been any necessity for it. As there was\r\nnone, he drank a few cups of claret, and sang (to himself) a strophe\r\nor two of the canzonettes of the divine Astrophel. But in spite both of\r\nwine and of Sir Philip Sidney, the connexion in which he now stood,\r\nand that which he was in future to hold, with the lovely Molinara, or\r\nMysinda, as he had been pleased to denominate Mysie Happer, recurred\r\nto his mind. The fashion of the times (as we have already noticed)\r\nfortunately coincided with his own natural generosity of disposition,\r\nwhich indeed amounted almost to extravagance, in prohibiting, as\r\na deadly sin, alike against gallantry, chivalry, and morality, his\r\nrewarding the good offices he had received from this poor maiden, by\r\nabusing any of the advantages which her confidence in his honour had\r\nafforded. To do Sir Piercie justice, it was an idea which never entered\r\ninto his head; and he would probably have dealt the most scientific\r\n_imbroccata, stoccata_, or _punto reverso_, which the school of Vincent\r\nSaviola had taught him, to any man who had dared to suggest to him such\r\nselfish and ungrateful meanness. On the other hand, he was a man, and\r\nforesaw various circumstances which might render their journey together\r\nin this intimate fashion a scandal and a snare. Moreover, he was a\r\ncoxcomb and a courtier, and felt there was something ridiculous in\r\ntravelling the land with a miller\'s daughter behind his saddle, giving\r\nrise to suspicions not very creditable to either, and to ludicrous\r\nconstructions, so far as he himself was concerned.\r\n\r\n"I would," he said half aloud, "that if such might be done without harm\r\nor discredit to the too-ambitious, yet too-well-distinguishing Molinara,\r\nshe and I were fairly severed, and bound on our different courses; even\r\nas we see the goodly vessel bound for the distant seas hoist sails and\r\nbear away into the deep, while the humble fly-boat carries to shore\r\nthose friends, who, with wounded hearts and watery eyes, have committed\r\nto their higher destinies the more daring adventurers by whom the fair\r\nfrigate is manned."\r\n\r\nHe had scarce uttered the wish when it was gratified; for the host\r\nentered to say that his worshipful knighthood\'s horse was ready to\r\nbe brought forth as he had desired; and on his inquiry for "the--the\r\ndamsel--that is--the young woman--"\r\n\r\n"Mysie Happer," said the landlord, "has returned to her father\'s; but\r\nshe bade me say, you could not miss the road for Edinburgh, in respect\r\nit was neither far way nor foul gate."\r\n\r\nIt is seldom we are exactly blessed with the precise fulfilment of our\r\nwishes at the moment when we utter them; perhaps, because Heaven wisely\r\nwithholds what, if granted, would be often received with ingratitude.\r\nSo at least it chanced in the present instance; for when mine host said\r\nthat Mysie was returned homeward, the knight was tempted to reply, with\r\nan ejaculation of surprise and vexation, and a hasty demand, whither and\r\nwhen she had departed? The first emotions his prudence suppressed, the\r\nsecond found utterance.\r\n\r\n"Where is she gane?" said the host, gazing on him, and repeating his\r\nquestion--"She is gane hame to her father\'s, it is like--and she gaed\r\njust when she gave orders about your worship\'s horse, and saw it well\r\nfed, (she might have trusted me, but millers and millers\' kin think a\'\r\nbody as thief-like as themselves,) an\' she\'s three miles on the gate by\r\nthis time."\r\n\r\n"Is she gone then?" muttered Sir Piercie, making two or three hasty\r\nstrides through the narrow apartment--"Is she gone?--Well, then, let\r\nher go. She could have had but disgrace by abiding by me, and I little\r\ncredit by her society. That I should have thought there was such\r\ndifficulty in shaking her off! I warrant she is by this time laughing\r\nwith some clown she has encountered; and my rich chain will prove a good\r\ndowry.--And ought it not to prove so? and has she not deserved it, were\r\nit ten times more valuable?--Piercie Shafton! Piercie Shafton! dost thou\r\ngrudge thy deliverer the guerdon she hath so dearly won? The selfish air\r\nof this northern land hath infected thee, Piercie Shafton! and blighted\r\nthe blossoms of thy generosity, even as it is said to shrivel the\r\nflowers of the mulberry.--Yet I thought," he added, after a moment\'s\r\npause, "that she would not so easily and voluntarily have parted from\r\nme. But it skills not thinking of it.--Cast my reckoning, mine host, and\r\nlet your groom lead forth my nag."\r\n\r\nThe good host seemed also to have some mental point to discuss, for he\r\nanswered not instantly, debating perhaps whether his conscience would\r\nbear a double charge for the same guests. Apparently his conscience\r\nreplied in the negative, though not without hesitation, for he at length\r\nreplied--"It\'s daffing to lee; it winna deny that the lawing is clean\r\npaid. Ne\'ertheless, if your worshipful knighthood pleases to give aught\r\nfor increase of trouble--"\r\n\r\n"How!" said the knight; "the reckoning paid? and by whom, I pray you?"\r\n\r\n"E\'en by Mysie Happer, if truth maun be spoken, as I said before,"\r\nanswered the honest landlord, with as many compunctious visitings for\r\ntelling the verity as another might have felt for making a lie in the\r\ncircumstances--"And out of the moneys supplied for your honour\'s journey\r\nby the Abbot, as she tauld to me. And laith were I to surcharge any\r\ngentleman that darkens my doors." He added in the confidence of honesty\r\nwhich his frank avowal entitled him to entertain, "Nevertheless, as I\r\nsaid before, if it pleases your knighthood of free good-will to consider\r\nextraordinary trouble--"\r\n\r\nThe knight cut short his argument, by throwing the landlord a\r\nrose-noble, which probably doubled the value of a Scottish reckoning,\r\nthough it would have defrayed but a half one at the Three Cranes or the\r\nVintry. The bounty so much delighted mine host, that he ran to fill the\r\nstirrup-cup (for which no charge was ever made) from a butt yet charier\r\nthan that which he had pierced for the former stoup. The knight paced\r\nslowly to horse, partook of his courtesy, and thanked him with the stiff\r\ncondescension of the court of Elizabeth; then mounted and followed the\r\nnorthern path, which was pointed out as the nearest to Edinburgh, and\r\nwhich, though very unlike a modern highway, bore yet so distinct\r\na resemblance to a public and frequented road as not to be easily\r\nmistaken.\r\n\r\n"I shall not need her guidance it seems," said he to himself, as he\r\nrode slowly onward; "and I suppose that was one reason of her abrupt\r\ndeparture, so different from what one might have expected.--Well, I am\r\nwell rid of her. Do we not pray to be liberated from temptation? Yet\r\nthat she should have erred so much in estimation of her own situation\r\nand mine, as to think of defraying the reckoning! I would I saw her once\r\nmore, but to explain to her the solecism of which her inexperience hath\r\nrendered her guilty. And I fear," he added, as he emerged from some\r\nstraggling trees, and looked out upon a wild moorish country, composed\r\nof a succession of swelling lumpish hills, "I fear I shall soon want the\r\naid of this Ariadne, who might afford me a clew through the recesses of\r\nyonder mountainous labyrinth."\r\n\r\nAs the Knight thus communed with himself, his attention was caught by\r\nthe sound of a horse\'s footsteps; and a lad, mounted on a little gray\r\nScottish nag, about fourteen hands high, coming along a path which\r\nled from behind the trees, joined him on the high-road, if it could be\r\ntermed such. The dress of the lad was completely in village fashion, yet\r\nneat and handsome in appearance. He had a jerkin of gray cloth slashed\r\nand trimmed, with black hose of the same, with deer-skin rullions or\r\nsandals, and handsome silver spurs. A cloak of a dark mulberry colour\r\nwas closely drawn round the upper part of his person, and the cape in\r\npart muffled his face, which was also obscured by his bonnet of black\r\nvelvet cloth, and its little plume of feathers.\r\n\r\nSir Piercie Shafton, fond of society, desirous also to have a guide,\r\nand, moreover, prepossessed in favour of so handsome a youth, failed not\r\nto ask him whence he came, and whither he was going. The youth looked\r\nanother way, as he answered, that he was going to Edinburgh, "to seek\r\nservice in some nobleman\'s family."\r\n\r\n"I fear me you have run away from your last master," said Sir Piercie,\r\n"since you dare not look me in the face while you answer my question."\r\n\r\n"Indeed, sir, I have not," answered the lad, bashfully, while, as if\r\nwith reluctance, he turned round his face, and instantly withdrew it. It\r\nwas a glance, but the discovery was complete. There was no mistaking\r\nthe dark full eye, the cheek in which much embarrassment could not\r\naltogether disguise an expression of comic humour, and the whole figure\r\nat once betrayed, under her metamorphosis, the Maid of the Mill. The\r\nrecognition was joyful, and Sir Piercie Shafton was too much pleased to\r\nhave regained his companion to remember the very good reasons which had\r\nconsoled him for losing her.\r\n\r\nTo his questions respecting her dress, she answered that she had\r\nobtained it in the Kirktown from a friend; it was the holiday suit of a\r\nson of hers, who had taken the field with his liege-lord, the baron of\r\nthe land. She had borrowed the suit under pretence she meant to play\r\nin some mumming or rural masquerade. She had left, she said, her own\r\napparel in exchange, which was better worth ten crowns than this was\r\nworth four.\r\n\r\n"And the nag, my ingenious Molinara," said Sir Piercie, "whence comes\r\nthe nag?"\r\n\r\n"I borrowed him from our host at the Gled\'s-Nest," she replied; and\r\nadded, half stifling a laugh, "he has sent to get, instead of it, our\r\nBall, which I left in the Tasker\'s Park at Cripplecross. He will be\r\nlucky if he find it there."\r\n\r\n"But then the poor man will lose his horse, most argute Mysinda," said\r\nSir Piercie Shafton, whose English notions of property were a little\r\nstartled at a mode of acquisition more congenial to the ideas of a\r\nmiller\'s daughter (and he a Border miller to boot) than with those of an\r\nEnglish person of quality.\r\n\r\n"And if he does lose his horse," said Mysie, laughing, "surely he is not\r\nthe first man on the marches who has had such a mischance. But he will\r\nbe no loser, for I warrant he will stop the value out of moneys which he\r\nhas owed my father this many a day."\r\n\r\n"But then your father will be the loser," objected yet again the\r\npertinacious uprightness of Sir Piercie Shafton.\r\n\r\n"What signifies it now to talk of my father?" said the damsel,\r\npettishly; then instantly changing to a tone of deep feeling, she added,\r\n"my father has this day lost that which will make him hold light the\r\nloss of all the gear he has left."\r\n\r\nStruck with the accents of remorseful sorrow in which his companion\r\nuttered these few words, the English knight felt himself bound both in\r\nhonour and conscience to expostulate with her as strongly as he could,\r\non the risk of the step which she had now taken, and on the propriety of\r\nher returning to her father\'s house. The matter of his discourse, though\r\nadorned with many unnecessary flourishes, was honourable both to his\r\nhead and heart.\r\n\r\nThe Maid of the Mill listened to his flowing periods with her head sunk\r\non her bosom as she rode, like one in deep thought or deeper sorrow.\r\nWhen he had finished, she raised up her countenance, looked full on\r\nthe knight, and replied with great firmness--"If you are weary of my\r\ncompany, Sir Piercie Shafton, you have but to say so, and the Miller\'s\r\ndaughter will be no farther cumber to you. And do not think I will be a\r\nburden to you, if we travel together to Edinburgh; I have wit enough and\r\npride enough to be a willing burden to no man. But if you reject not my\r\ncompany at present, and fear not it will be burdensome to you hereafter,\r\nspeak no more to me of returning back. All that you can say to me I have\r\nsaid to myself; and that I am now here, is a sign that I have said it to\r\nno purpose. Let this subject, therefore, be forever ended betwixt us.\r\nI have already, in some small fashion, been useful to you, and the time\r\nmay come I may be more so; for this is not your land of England, where\r\nmen say justice is done with little fear or favour to great and to\r\nsmall; but it is a land where men do by the strong hand, and defend by\r\nthe ready wit, and I know better than you the perils you are exposed\r\nto."\r\n\r\nSir Piercie Shafton was somewhat mortified to find that the damsel\r\nconceived her presence useful to him as a protectress as well as guide,\r\nand said something of seeking protection of nought save his own arm and\r\nhis good sword. Mysie answered very quietly, that she nothing doubted\r\nhis bravery; but it was that very quality of bravery which was most\r\nlikely to involve him in danger. Sir Piercie Shafton, whose head never\r\nkept very long in any continued train of thinking, acquiesced without\r\nmuch reply, resolving in his own mind that the maiden only used this\r\napology to disguise her real motive, of affection to his person.\r\nThe romance of the situation flattered his vanity and elevated his\r\nimagination, as placing him in the situation of one of those romantic\r\nheroes of whom he had read the histories, where similar transformations\r\nmade a distinguished figure.\r\n\r\nHe took many a sidelong glance at his page, whose habits of country\r\nsport and country exercise had rendered her quite adequate to sustain\r\nthe character she had assumed. She managed the little nag with\r\ndexterity, and even with grace; nor did any thing appear that could\r\nhave betrayed her disguise, except when a bashful consciousness of her\r\ncompanion\'s eye being fixed on her, gave her an appearance of temporary\r\nembarrassment, which greatly added to her beauty.\r\n\r\nThe couple rode forward as in the morning, pleased with themselves and\r\nwith each other, until they arrived at the village where they were to\r\nrepose for the night, and where all the inhabitants of the little inn,\r\nboth male and female, joined in extolling the good grace and handsome\r\ncountenance of the English knight, and the uncommon beauty of his\r\nyouthful attendant.\r\n\r\nIt was here that Mysie Happer first made Sir Piercie Shafton sensible\r\nof the reserved manner in which she proposed to live with him. She\r\nannounced him as her master, and, waiting upon him with the reverent\r\ndemeanour of an actual domestic, permitted not the least approach to\r\nfamiliarity, not even such as the knight might with the utmost innocence\r\nhave ventured upon. For example, Sir Piercie, who, as we know, was a\r\ngreat connoisseur in dress, was detailing to her the advantageous change\r\nwhich he proposed to make in her attire as soon as they should reach\r\nEdinburgh, by arraying her in his own colours of pink and carnation.\r\nMysie Happer listened with great complacency to the unction with which\r\nhe dilated upon welts, laces, slashes, and trimmings, until, carried\r\naway by the enthusiasm with which he was asserting the superiority of\r\nthe falling band over the Spanish ruff, he approached his hand, in\r\nthe way of illustration, towards the collar of his page\'s doublet. She\r\ninstantly stepped back and gravely reminded him that she was alone and\r\nunder his protection.\r\n\r\n"You cannot but remember the cause which has brought me here," she\r\ncontinued; "make the least approach to any familiarity which you would\r\nnot offer to a princess surrounded by her court, and you have seen the\r\nlast of the Miller\'s daughter--She will vanish as the chaff disappears\r\nfrom the shieling-hill [Footnote: The place where corn was winnowed,\r\nwhile that operation was performed by the hand, was called in Scotland\r\nthe Shieling-hill.] when the west wind blows."\r\n\r\n"I do protest, fair Molinara," said Sir Piercie Shafton--but the fair\r\nMolinara had disappeared before his protest could be uttered. "A most\r\nsingular wench," said he to himself; "and by this hand, as discreet\r\nas she is fair-featured--Certes, shame it were to offer her scathe\r\nor dishonour! She makes similes too, though somewhat savouring of her\r\ncondition. Had she but read Euphues, and forgotten that accursed mill\r\nand shieling-hill, it is my thought that her converse would be broidered\r\nwith as many and as choice pearls of compliment, as that of the most\r\nrhetorical lady in the court of Feliciana. I trust she means to return\r\nto bear me company."\r\n\r\nBut that was no part of Mysie\'s prudential scheme. It was then drawing\r\nto dusk, and he saw her not again until the next morning, when the\r\nhorses were brought to the door that they might prosecute their journey.\r\n\r\nBut our story here necessarily leaves the English knight and his page,\r\nto return to the Tower of Glendearg.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter the Thirtieth.\r\n\r\n\r\n  You call it an ill angel it may be so,\r\n  But sure I am, among the ranks which fell,\r\n  \'Tis the first fiend e\'er counsell\'d man to rise,\r\n  And win the bliss the sprite himself had forfeited.\r\n                             OLD PLAY.\r\n\r\nWe must resume our narrative at the period when Mary Avenel was\r\nconveyed to the apartment which had been formerly occupied by the two\r\nGlendinnings, and when her faithful attendant, Tibbie, had exhausted\r\nherself in useless attempts to compose and to comfort her. Father\r\nEustace also dealt forth with well-meant kindness those apophthegms and\r\ndogmata of consolation, which friendship almost always offers to grief,\r\nthough they are uniformly offered in vain. She was at length left to\r\nindulge in the desolation of her own sorrowful feelings. She felt as\r\nthose who, loving for the first time, have lost what they loved, before\r\ntime and repeated calamity have taught them that every loss is to a\r\ncertain extent reparable or endurable.\r\n\r\nSuch grief may be conceived better than it can be described, as is well\r\nknown to those who have experienced it. But Mary Avenel had been taught\r\nby the peculiarity of her situation, to regard herself as the Child of\r\nDestiny; and the melancholy and reflecting turn of her disposition\r\ngave to her sorrows a depth and breadth peculiar to her character. The\r\ngrave--and it was a bloody grave--had closed, as she believed, over the\r\nyouth to whom she was secretly, but most warmly attached; the force and\r\nardour of Halbert\'s character bearing a singular correspondence to the\r\nenergy of which her own was capable. Her sorrow did not exhaust\r\nitself in sighs and tears, but when the first shock had passed away,\r\nconcentrated itself with deep and steady meditation, to collect and\r\ncalculate, like a bankrupt debtor, the full amount of her loss. It\r\nseemed as if all that connected her with earth, had vanished with this\r\nbroken tie. She had never dared to anticipate the probability of an\r\nultimate union with Halbert, yet now his supposed fall seemed that of\r\nthe only tree which was to shelter her from the storm. She respected\r\nthe more gentle character, and more peaceful attainments, of the younger\r\nGlendinning; but it had not escaped her (what never indeed escaped\r\nwoman in such circumstances) that he was disposed to place himself in\r\ncompetition with what she, the daughter of a proud and warlike race,\r\ndeemed the more manly qualities of his elder brother; and there is no\r\ntime when a woman does so little justice to the character of a surviving\r\nlover, as when comparing him with the preferred rival of whom she has\r\nbeen recently deprived.\r\n\r\nThe motherly, but coarse kindness of Dame Glendinning, and the doating\r\nfondness of her old domestic, seemed now the only kind feeling of which\r\nshe formed the object; and she could not but reflect how little these\r\nwere to be compared with the devoted attachment of a high-souled youth,\r\nwhom the least glance of her eye could command, as the high-mettled\r\nsteed is governed by the bridle of the rider. It was when plunged among\r\nthese desolating reflections, that Mary Avenel felt the void of mind,\r\narising from the narrow and bigoted ignorance in which Rome then\r\neducated the children of her church. Their whole religion was a ritual,\r\nand their prayers were the formal iteration of unknown words, which, in\r\nthe hour of affliction, could yield but little consolation to those who\r\nfrom habit resorted to them. Unused to the practice of mental devotion,\r\nand of personal approach to the Divine Presence by prayer, she could not\r\nhelp exclaiming in her distress, "There is no aid for me on earth, and I\r\nknow not how to ask it from Heaven!"\r\n\r\nAs she spoke thus in an agony of sorrow, she cast her eyes into the\r\napartment, and saw the mysterious Spirit, which waited upon the fortunes\r\nof her house, standing in the moonlight in the midst of the room. The\r\nsame form, as the reader knows, had more than once offered itself to\r\nher sight; and either her native boldness of mind, or some peculiarity\r\nattached to her from her birth, made her now look upon it without\r\nshrinking. But the White Lady of Avenel was now more distinctly visible,\r\nand more closely present, than she had ever before seemed to be, and\r\nMary was appalled by her presence. She would, however, have spoken; but\r\nthere ran a tradition, that though others who had seen the White Lady\r\nhad asked questions and received answers, yet those of the house of\r\nAvenel who had ventured to speak to her, had never long survived the\r\ncolloquy. The figure, besides, as sitting up in her bed, Mary Avenel\r\ngazed on it intently, seemed by its gestures to caution her to keep\r\nsilence, and at the same time to bespeak attention.\r\n\r\nThe White Lady then seemed to press one of the planks of the floor with\r\nher foot, while, in her usual low, melancholy, and musical chant, she\r\nrepeated the following verses:\r\n\r\n  "Maiden, whose sorrows wail the Living Dead,\r\n    Whose eyes shall commune with the Dead Alive,\r\n  Maiden, attend! Beneath my foot lies hid\r\n    The Word, the Law, the Path, which thou dost strive\r\n  To find and canst not find.--Could spirits shed\r\n    Tears for their lot, it were my lot to weep,\r\n  Showing the road which I shall never tread,\r\n    Though my foot points it.--Sleep, eternal sleep,\r\n  Dark, long, and cold forgetfulness my lot!--\r\n    But do not thou at human ills repine,\r\n  Secure there lies full guerdon in this spot\r\n    For all the woes that wait frail Adam\'s line--\r\n  Stoop, then, and make it yours--I may not make it mine!"\r\n\r\nThe phantom stooped towards the floor as she concluded, as if with the\r\nintention of laying her hand on the board on which she stood. But\r\nere she had completed that gesture, her form became indistinct, was\r\npresently only like the shade of a fleecy cloud, which passed betwixt\r\nearth and the moon, and was soon altogether invisible.\r\n\r\nA strong impression of fear, the first which she had experienced in her\r\nlife to any agitating extent, seized upon the mind of Mary Avenel, and\r\nfor a minute she felt a disposition to faint. She repelled it, however,\r\nmustered her courage, and addressed herself to saints and angels, as\r\nher church recommended. Broken slumbers at length stole on her exhausted\r\nmind and frame, and she slept until the dawn was about to rise, when\r\nshe was awakened by the cry of "Treason! treason! follow, follow!" which\r\narose in the tower, when it was found that Piercie Shafton had made his\r\nescape.\r\n\r\nApprehensive of some new misfortune, Mary Avenel hastily arranged the\r\ndress which she had not laid aside, and, venturing to quit her chamber,\r\nlearned from Tibb, who, with her gray hairs dishevelled like those of\r\na sibyl, was flying from room to room, that the bloody Southron villain\r\nhad made his escape, and that Halbert Glendinning, poor bairn,\r\nwould sleep unrevenged and unquiet in his bloody grave. In the lower\r\napartments, the young men were roaring like thunder, and venting\r\nin oaths and exclamations against the fugitives the rage which they\r\nexperienced in finding themselves locked up within the tower, and\r\ndebarred from their vindictive pursuit by the wily precautions of Mysie\r\nHapper. The authoritative voice of the Sub-Prior commanding silence was\r\nnext heard; upon which Mary Avenel, whose tone of feeling did not lead\r\nher to enter into counsel or society with the rest of the party, again\r\nretired to her solitary chamber.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the family held counsel in the spence, Edward almost beside\r\nhimself with rage, and the Sub-Prior in no small degree offended at the\r\neffrontery of Mysie Happer in attempting such a scheme, as well as at\r\nthe mingled boldness and dexterity with which it had been executed. But\r\nneither surprise nor anger availed aught. The windows, well secured\r\nwith iron bars for keeping assailants out, proved now as effectual for\r\ndetaining the inhabitants within. The battlements were open, indeed; but\r\nwithout ladder or ropes to act as a substitute for wings, there was no\r\npossibility of descending from them. They easily succeeded in alarming\r\nthe inhabitants of the cottages beyond the precincts of the court; but\r\nthe men had been called in to strengthen the guard for the night, and\r\nonly women and children remained who could contribute nothing in the\r\nemergency, except their useless exclamations of surprise, and there were\r\nno neighbours for miles around. Dame Elspeth, however, though drowned in\r\ntears, was not so unmindful of external affairs, but that she could find\r\nvoice enough to tell the women and children without, to "leave their\r\nskirling, and look after the cows that she couldna get minded, what\r\nwi\' the awfu\' distraction of her mind, what wi\' that fause slut having\r\nlocked them up in their ain tower as fast as if they had been in the\r\nJeddart tolbooth."\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the men finding other modes of exit impossible, unanimously\r\nconcluded to force the doors with such tools as the house afforded\r\nfor the purpose. These were not very proper for the occasion, and\r\nthe strength of the doors was great. The interior one, formed of oak,\r\noccupied them for three mortal hours, and there was little prospect of\r\nthe iron door being forced in double the time.\r\n\r\nWhile they were engaged in this ungrateful toil, Mary Avenel had\r\nwith much less labour acquired exact knowledge of what the Spirit had\r\nintimated in her mystic rhyme. On examining the spot which the phantom\r\nhad indicated by her gestures, it was not difficult to discover that a\r\nboard had been loosened, which might be raised at pleasure. On removing\r\nthis piece of plank, Mary Avenel was astonished to find the Black Book,\r\nwell remembered by her as her mother\'s favourite study, of which she\r\nimmediately took possession, with as much joy as her present situation\r\nrendered her capable of feeling.\r\n\r\nIgnorant in a great measure of its contents, Mary Avenel had been\r\ntaught from her infancy to hold this volume in sacred veneration. It\r\nis probable that the deceased Lady of Walter Avenel only postponed\r\ninitiating her daughter into the mysteries of the Divine Word, until she\r\nshould be better able to comprehend both the lessons which it taught,\r\nand the risk at which, in those times, they were studied. Death\r\ninterposed, and removed her before the times became favourable to the\r\nreformers, and before her daughter was so far advanced in age as to\r\nbe fit to receive religious instruction of this deep import. But the\r\naffectionate mother had made preparations for the earthly work which she\r\nhad most at heart. There were slips of paper inserted in the volume, in\r\nwhich, by an appeal to, and a comparison of, various passages in holy\r\nwrit, the errors and human inventions with which the Church of Rome had\r\ndefaced the simple edifice of Christianity, as erected by its divine\r\narchitect, were pointed out. These controversial topics were treated\r\nwith a spirit of calmness and Christian charity, which might have been\r\nan example to the theologians of the period; but they were clearly,\r\nfairly, and plainly argued, and supported by the necessary proofs and\r\nreferences. Other papers there were which had no reference whatever to\r\npolemics, but were the simple effusions of a devout mind communing with\r\nitself. Among these was one frequently used, as it seemed from the\r\nstate of the manuscript, on which the mother of Mary had transcribed and\r\nplaced together those affecting texts to which the heart has recourse,\r\nin affliction, and which assures us at once of the sympathy and\r\nprotection afforded to the children of the promise. In Mary Avenel\'s\r\nstate of mind, these attracted her above all the other lessons, which,\r\ncoming from a hand so dear, had reached her at a time so critical, and\r\nin a manner so touching. She read the affecting promise, "I will never\r\nleave thee nor forsake thee," and the consoling exhortation, "Call upon\r\nme in the day of trouble, and I will deliver thee." She read them, and\r\nher heart acquiesced in the conclusion. Surely this is the word of God!\r\n\r\nThere are those to whom a sense of religion has come in storm and\r\ntempest; there are those whom it has summoned amid scenes of revelry\r\nand idle vanity; there are those, too, who have heard its "still small\r\nvoice" amid rural leisure and placid contentment. But perhaps the\r\nknowledge which causeth not to err, is most frequently impressed upon\r\nthe mind during seasons of affliction; and tears are the softened\r\nshowers which cause the seed of Heaven to spring and take root in the\r\nhuman breast. At least it was thus with Mary Avenel. She was insensible\r\nto the discordant noise which rang below, the clang of bars and the\r\njarring symphony of the levers which they used to force them, the\r\nmeasured shouts of the labouring inmates as they combined their strength\r\nfor each heave, and gave time with their voices to the exertion of their\r\narms, and their deeply muttered vows of revenge on the fugitives who had\r\nbequeathed them at their departure a task so toilsome and difficult. Not\r\nall this din, combined in hideous concert, and expressive of aught but\r\npeace, love, and forgiveness, could divert Mary Avenel from the new\r\ncourse of study on which she had so singularly entered. "The serenity\r\nof Heaven," she said, "is above me; the sounds which are around are but\r\nthose of earth and earthly passion."\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the noon was passed, and little impression was made on the\r\niron grate, when they who laboured at it received a sudden reinforcement\r\nby the unexpected arrival of Christie of the Clinthill. He came at the\r\nhead of a small party, consisting of four horsemen, who bore in their\r\ncaps the sprig of holly, which was the badge of Avenel.\r\n\r\n"What, ho!--my masters," he said, "I bring you a prisoner."\r\n\r\n"You had better have brought us liberty," said Dan of the Howlet-hirst.\r\n\r\nChristie looked at the state of affairs with great surprise. "An I were\r\nto be hanged for it," he said, "as I may for as little a matter, I could\r\nnot forbear laughing at seeing men peeping through their own bars like\r\nso many rats in a rat-trap, and he with the beard behind, like the\r\noldest rat in the cellar."\r\n\r\n"Hush, thou unmannered knave," said Edward, "it is the Sub-Prior; and\r\nthis is neither time, place, nor company, for your ruffian jests."\r\n\r\n"What, ho! is my young master malapert?" said Christie; "why, man, were\r\nhe my own carnal father, instead of being father to half the world,\r\nI would have my laugh out. And now it is over, I must assist you, I\r\nreckon, for you are setting very greenly about this gear--put the pinch\r\nnearer the staple, man, and hand me an iron crow through the grate, for\r\nthat\'s the fowl to fly away with a wicket on its shoulders. I have broke\r\ninto as many grates as you have teeth in your young head--ay, and broke\r\nout of them too, as the captain of the Castle of Lochmaben knows full\r\nwell."\r\n\r\nChristie did not boast more skill than he really possessed; for,\r\napplying their combined strength, under the direction of that\r\nexperienced engineer, bolt and staple gave way before them, and in less\r\nthan half an hour, the grate, which had so long repelled their force,\r\nstood open before them.\r\n\r\n"And now," said Edward, "to horse, my mates, and pursue the villain\r\nShafton!"\r\n\r\n"Halt, there," said Christie of the Clinthill; "pursue your guest, my\r\nmaster\'s friend and my own?--there go two words to that bargain. What\r\nthe foul fiend would you pursue him for?"\r\n\r\n"Let me pass," said Edward, vehemently, "I will be staid by no man--the\r\nvillain has murdered my brother!"\r\n\r\n"What says he?" said Christie, turning to the others; "murdered? who is\r\nmurdered, and by whom?"\r\n\r\n"The Englishman, Sir Piercie Shafton," said Dan of the Howlet-hirst,\r\n"has murdered young Halbert Glendinning yesterday morning, and we have\r\nall risen to the fray."\r\n\r\n"It is a bedlam business, I think," said Christie. "First I find you all\r\nlocked up in your own tower, and next I am come to prevent you revenging\r\na murder that was never committed!"\r\n\r\n"I tell you," said Edward, "that my brother was slain and buried\r\nyesterday morning by this false Englishman."\r\n\r\n"And I tell you," answered Christie, "that I saw him alive and well last\r\nnight. I would I knew his trick of getting out of the grave; most men\r\nfind it more hard to break through a green sod than a grated door."\r\n\r\nEvery body now paused, and looked on Christie in astonishment, until the\r\nSub-Prior, who had hitherto avoided communication with him, came up and\r\nrequired earnestly to know, whether he meant really to maintain that\r\nHalbert Glendinning lived.\r\n\r\n"Father," he said, with, more respect than he usually showed to any\r\none save his master, "I confess I may sometimes jest with those of your\r\ncoat, but not with you; because, as you may partly recollect, I owe you\r\na life. It is certain as the sun is in heaven, that Halbert Glendinning\r\nsupped at the house of my master the Baron of Avenel last night, and\r\nthat he came thither in company with an old man, of whom more anon."\r\n\r\n"And where is he now?"\r\n\r\n"The devil only can answer that question," replied Christie, "for the\r\ndevil has possessed the whole family, I think. He took fright, the\r\nfoolish lad, at something or other which our Baron did in his moody\r\nhumour, and so he jumped into the lake and swam ashore like a wild-duck.\r\nRobin of Redcastle spoiled a good gelding in chasing him this morning."\r\n\r\n"And why did he chase the youth?" said the Sub-Prior; "what harm had he\r\ndone?"\r\n\r\n"None that I know of," said Christie; "but such was the Baron\'s order,\r\nbeing in his mood, and all the world having gone mad, as I have said\r\nbefore."\r\n\r\n"Whither away so fast, Edward?" said the monk.\r\n\r\n"To Corri-nan-shian, Father," answered the youth.--"Martin and Dan, take\r\npickaxe and mattock, and follow me if you be men!"\r\n\r\n"Right," said the monk, "and fail not to give us instant notice what you\r\nfind."\r\n\r\n"If you find aught there like Halbert Glendinning," said Christie,\r\nhallooing after Edward, "I will be bound to eat him unsalted.--\'T is\r\na sight to see how that fellow takes the bent!--It is in the time of\r\naction men see what lads are made of. Halbert was aye skipping up and\r\ndown like a roo, and his brother used to sit in the chimney nook with\r\nhis book and sic-like trash--But the lad was like a loaded hackbut,\r\nwhich will stand in the corner as quiet as an old crutch until ye draw\r\nthe trigger, and then there is nothing but flash and smoke.--But here\r\ncomes my prisoner; and, setting other matters aside, I must pray a word\r\nwith you, Sir Sub-Prior, respecting him. I came on before to treat about\r\nhim, but I was interrupted with this fasherie."\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, two more of Avenel\'s troopers rode into the court-yard,\r\nleading betwixt them a horse, on which, with his hands bound to his\r\nside, sate the reformed preacher, Henry Warden.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter the Thirty-First.\r\n\r\n\r\n  At school I knew him--a sharp-witted youth,\r\n  Grave, thoughtful, and reserved among his mates,\r\n  Turning the hours of sport and food to labour,\r\n  Starving his body to inform his mind.\r\n                                           OLD PLAY.\r\n\r\nThe Sub-Prior, at the Borderer\'s request, had not failed to return to\r\nthe tower, into which he was followed by Christie of the Clinthill, who,\r\nshutting the door of the apartment, drew near, and began his discourse\r\nwith great confidence and familiarity.\r\n\r\n"My master," he said, "sends me with his commendations to you, Sir\r\nSub-Prior, above all the community of Saint Mary\'s, and more specially\r\nthan even to the Abbot himself; for though he be termed my lord, and so\r\nforth, all the world knows that you are the tongue of the trump."\r\n\r\n"If you have aught to say to me concerning the community," said the\r\nSub-Prior, "it were well you proceeded in it without farther delay. Time\r\npresses, and the fate of young Glendinnning dwells on my mind."\r\n\r\n"I will be caution for him, body for body," said Christie. "I do protest\r\nto you, as sure as I am a living man, so surely is he one."\r\n\r\n"Should I not tell his unhappy mother the joyful tidings?" said Father\r\nEustace,--"and yet better wait till they return from searching the\r\ngrave. Well, Sir Jackman, your message to me from your master?"\r\n\r\n"My lord and master," said Christie, "hath good reason to believe that,\r\nfrom the information of certain back friends, whom he will reward at\r\nmore leisure, your reverend community hath been led to deem him ill\r\nattached to Holy Church, allied with heretics and those who favour\r\nheresy, and a hungerer after the spoils of your Abbey."\r\n\r\n"Be brief, good henchman," said the Sub-Prior, "for the devil is ever\r\nmost to be feared when he preacheth."\r\n\r\n"Briefly, then--my master desires your friendship; and to excuse himself\r\nfrom the maligner\'s calumnies, he sends to your Abbot that Henry Warden,\r\nwhose sermons have turned the world upside down, to be dealt with as\r\nHoly Church directs, and as the Abbot\'s pleasure may determine."\r\n\r\nThe Sub-Prior\'s eyes sparkled at the intelligence; for it had been\r\naccounted a matter of great importance that this man should be arrested,\r\npossessed, as he was known to be, of so much zeal and popularity, that\r\nscarcely the preaching of Knox himself had been more awakening to the\r\npeople, and more formidable to the Church of Rome.\r\n\r\nIn fact, that ancient system, which so well accommodated its doctrines\r\nto the wants and wishes of a barbarous age, had, since the art of\r\nprinting, and the gradual diffusion of knowledge, lain floating like\r\nsome huge Leviathan, into which ten thousand reforming fishers were\r\ndarting their harpoons. The Roman Church of Scotland, in particular,\r\nwas at her last gasp, actually blowing blood and water, yet still with\r\nunremitted, though animal exertions, maintaining the conflict with the\r\nassailants, who on every side were plunging their weapons into her bulky\r\nbody. In many large towns, the monasteries had been suppressed by\r\nthe fury of the populace; in other places, their possessions had been\r\nusurped by the power of the reformed nobles; but still the hierarchy\r\nmade a part of the common law of the realm, and might claim both its\r\nproperty and its privileges wherever it had the means of asserting them.\r\nThe community of Saint Mary\'s of Kennaquhair was considered as being\r\nparticularly in this situation. They had retained, undiminished,\r\ntheir territorial power and influence; and the great barons in the\r\nneighbourhood, partly from their attachment to the party in the state\r\nwho still upheld the old system of religion, partly because each grudged\r\nthe share of the prey which the others must necessarily claim, had\r\nas yet abstained from despoiling the Halidome. The Community was also\r\nunderstood to be protected by the powerful Earls of Northumberland and\r\nWestmoreland, whose zealous attachment to the Catholic faith caused at a\r\nlater period the great rebellion of the tenth of Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nThus happily placed, it was supposed by the friends of the decaying\r\ncause of the Roman Catholic faith, that some determined example of\r\ncourage and resolution, exercised where the franchises of the church\r\nwere yet entire, and her jurisdiction undisputed, might awe the progress\r\nof the new opinions into activity; and, protected by the laws which\r\nstill existed, and by the favour of the sovereign, might be the means of\r\nsecuring the territory which Rome yet preserved in Scotland, and perhaps\r\nof recovering that which she had lost.\r\n\r\nThe matter had been considered more than once by the northern Catholics\r\nof Scotland, and they had held communication with those of the south.\r\nFather Eustace, devoted by his public and private vows, had caught the\r\nflame, and had eagerly advised that they should execute the doom of\r\nheresy on the first reformed preacher, or, according to his sense, on\r\nthe first heretic of eminence, who should venture within the precincts\r\nof the Halidome. A heart, naturally kind and noble, was, in this\r\ninstance, as it has been in many more, deceived by its own generosity.\r\nFather Eustace would have been a bad administrator of the inquisitorial\r\npower of Spain, where that power was omnipotent, and where judgment was\r\nexercised without danger to those who inflicted it. In such a situation\r\nhis rigour might have relented in favour of the criminal, whom it was\r\nat his pleasure to crush or to place at freedom. But in Scotland, during\r\nthis crisis, the case was entirely different. The question was, whether\r\none of the spirituality dared, at the hazard of his own life, to step\r\nforward to assert and exercise the rights of the church. Was there any\r\nwho would venture to wield the thunder in her cause, or must it remain\r\nlike that in the hand of a painted Jupiter, the object of derision\r\ninstead of terror? The crisis was calculated to awake the soul of\r\nEustace; for it comprised the question, whether he dared, at all hazards\r\nto himself, to execute with stoical severity a measure which, according\r\nto the general opinion, was to be advantageous to the church, and,\r\naccording to ancient law, and to his firm belief, was not only\r\njustifiable but meritorious.\r\n\r\nWhile such resolutions were agitated amongst the Catholics, chance\r\nplaced a victim within their grasp. Henry Warden had, with the animation\r\nproper to the enthusiastic reformers of the age, transgressed, in the\r\nvehemence of his zeal, the bounds of the discretional liberty allowed\r\nto his sect so far, that it was thought the Queen\'s personal dignity\r\nwas concerned in bringing him to justice. He fled from Edinburgh,\r\nwith recommendations, however, from Lord James Stewart, afterwards the\r\ncelebrated Earl of Murray, to some of the Border chieftains of inferior\r\nrank, who were privately conjured to procure him safe passage into\r\nEngland. One of the principal persons to whom such recommendation was\r\naddressed, was Julian Avenel; for as yet, and for a considerable time\r\nafterwards, the correspondence and interest of Lord James lay rather\r\nwith the subordinate leaders than with the chiefs of great power,\r\nand men of distinguished influence upon the Border. Julian Avenel had\r\nintrigued without scruple with both parties--yet bad as he was, he\r\ncertainly would not have practised aught against the guest whom Lord\r\nJames had recommended to his hospitality, had it not been for what he\r\ntermed the preacher\'s officious inter-meddling in his family affairs.\r\nBut when he had determined to make Warden rue the lecture he had read\r\nhim, and the scene of public scandal which he had caused in his hall,\r\nJulian resolved, with the constitutional shrewdness of his disposition,\r\nto combine his vengeance with his interest. And therefore, instead of\r\ndoing violence on the person of Henry Warden within his own castle, he\r\ndetermined to deliver him up to the Community of Saint Mary\'s, and at\r\nonce make them the instruments of his own revenge, and found a claim of\r\npersonal recompense, either in money, or in a grant of Abbey lands at a\r\nlow quit-rent, which last began now to be the established form in which\r\nthe temporal nobles plundered the spirituality.\r\n\r\nThe Sub-Prior, therefore, of Saint Mary\'s, unexpectedly saw the\r\nsteadfast, active, and inflexible enemy of the church delivered into\r\nhis hand, and felt himself called upon to make good his promises to the\r\nfriends of the Catholic faith, by quenching heresy in the blood of one\r\nof its most zealous professors.\r\n\r\nTo the honour more of Father Eustace\'s heart than of his consistency,\r\nthe communication that Henry Warden was placed within his power, struck\r\nhim with more sorrow than triumph; but his next feelings were those of\r\nexultation. "It is sad," he said to himself, "to cause human suffering;\r\nit is awful to cause human blood to be spilled; but the judge to\r\nwhom the sword of Saint Paul, as well as the keys of Saint Peter, are\r\nconfided, must not flinch from his task. Our weapon returns into our\r\nown bosom, if not wielded with a steady and unrelenting hand against the\r\nirreconcilable enemies of the Holy Church. _Pereat iste!_ It is the doom\r\nhe has incurred, and were all the heretics in Scotland armed and at his\r\nback, they should not prevent its being pronounced, and, if possible,\r\nenforced.--Bring the heretic before me," he said, issuing his commands\r\naloud, and in a tone of authority.\r\n\r\nHenry Warden was led in, his hands still bound, but his feet at liberty.\r\n\r\n"Clear the apartment," said the Sub-Prior, "of all but the necessary\r\nguard on the prisoner."\r\n\r\nAll retired except Christie of the Clinthill, who, having dismissed the\r\ninferior troopers whom he commanded, unsheathed his sword, and placed\r\nhimself beside the door, as if taking upon him the character of\r\nsentinel.\r\n\r\nThe judge and the accused met face to face, and in that of both was\r\nenthroned the noble confidence of rectitude. The monk was about, at\r\nthe utmost risk to himself and his community, to exercise what in his\r\nignorance he conceived to be his duty. The preacher, actuated by a\r\nbetter-informed, yet not a more ardent zeal, was prompt to submit to\r\nexecution for God\'s sake, and to seal, were it necessary, his mission\r\nwith his blood. Placed at such a distance of time as better enables us\r\nto appreciate the tendency of the principles on which they severally\r\nacted, we cannot doubt to which the palm ought to be awarded. But the\r\nzeal of Father Eustace was as free from passion and personal views as if\r\nit had been exerted in a better cause.\r\n\r\nThey approached each other, armed each and prepared for intellectual\r\nconflict, and each intently regarding his opponent, as if either hoped\r\nto spy out some defect, some chasm in the armour of his antagonist.--As\r\nthey gazed on each other, old recollections began to awake in either\r\nbosom, at the sight of features long unseen and much altered, but not\r\nforgotten. The brow of the Sub-Prior dismissed by degrees its frown of\r\ncommand, the look of calm yet stern defiance gradually vanished from\r\nthat of Warden, and both lost for an instant that of gloomy solemnity.\r\nThey had been ancient and intimate friends in youth at a foreign\r\nuniversity, but had been long separated from each other; and the change\r\nof name, which the preacher had adopted from motives of safety, and\r\nthe monk from the common custom of the convent, had prevented the\r\npossibility of their hitherto recognizing each other in the opposite\r\nparts which they had been playing in the great polemical and political\r\ndrama. But now the Sub-Prior exclaimed, "Henry Wellwood!" and the\r\npreacher replied, "William Allan!"--and, stirred by the old familiar\r\nnames, and never-to-be-forgotten recollections of college studies and\r\ncollege intimacy, their hands were for a moment locked in each other.\r\n\r\n"Remove his bonds," said the Sub-Prior, and assisted Christie in\r\nperforming that office with his own hands, although the prisoner\r\nscarcely would consent to be unbound, repeating with emphasis, that he\r\nrejoiced in the cause for which he suffered shame. When his hands\r\nwere at liberty, however, he showed his sense of the kindness by again\r\nexchanging a grasp and a look of affection with the Sub-Prior.\r\n\r\nThe salute was frank and generous on either side, yet it was but the\r\nfriendly recognition and greeting which are wont to take place betwixt\r\nadverse champions, who do nothing in hate but all in honour. As each\r\nfelt the pressure of the situation in which they stood, he quitted the\r\ngrasp of the other\'s hand, and fell back, confronting each other with\r\nlooks more calm and sorrowful than expressive of any other passion. The\r\nSub-Prior was the first to speak.\r\n\r\n"And is this, then, the end of that restless activity of mind, that bold\r\nand indefatigable love of truth that urged investigation to its\r\nutmost limits, and seemed to take heaven itself by storm--is this the\r\ntermination of Wellwood\'s career?--And having known and loved him during\r\nthe best years of our youth, do we meet in our old age as judge and\r\ncriminal?"\r\n\r\n"Not as judge and criminal," said Henry Warden,--for to avoid confusion\r\nwe describe him by his later and best known name--"Not as judge and\r\ncriminal do we meet, but as a misguided oppressor and his ready and\r\ndevoted victim. I, too, may ask, are these the harvest of the rich hopes\r\nexcited by the classical learning, acute logical powers, and varied\r\nknowledge of William Allan, that he should sink to be the solitary\r\ndrone of a cell, graced only above the swarm with the high commission of\r\nexecuting Roman malice on all who oppose Roman imposture?"\r\n\r\n"Not to thee," answered the Sub-Prior, "be assured--not unto thee, nor\r\nunto mortal man, will I render an account of the power with which the\r\nchurch may have invested me. It was granted but as a deposit for her\r\nwelfare--for her welfare it shall at every risk be exercised, without\r\nfear and without favour."\r\n\r\n"I expected no less from your misguided zeal," answered the preacher;\r\n"and in me have you met one on whom you may fearlessly exercise your\r\nauthority, secure that his mind at least will defy your influence, as\r\nthe snows of that Mont Blanc which we saw together, shrink not under the\r\nheat of the hottest summer sun."\r\n\r\n"I do believe thee," said the Sub-Prior, "I do believe that thine is\r\nindeed metal unmalleable by force. Let it yield then to persuasion. Let\r\nus debate these matters of faith, as we once were wont to conduct our\r\nscholastic disputes, when hours, nay, days, glided past in the mutual\r\nexercise of our intellectual powers. It may be thou mayest yet hear the\r\nvoice of the shepherd, and return to the universal fold."\r\n\r\n"No, Allan," replied the prisoner, "this is no vain question, devised by\r\ndreaming scholiasts, on which they may whet their intellectual faculties\r\nuntil the very metal be wasted away. The errors which I combat are like\r\nthose fiends which are only cast out by fasting and prayer. Alas! not\r\nmany wise, not many learned are chosen; the cottage and the hamlet shall\r\nin our days bear witness against the schools and their disciples. Thy\r\nvery wisdom, which is foolishness, hath made thee, as the Greeks of old,\r\nhold as foolishness that which is the only true wisdom."\r\n\r\n"This," said the Sub-Prior, sternly, "is the mere cant of ignorant\r\nenthusiasm, which appealeth from learning and from authority, from the\r\nsure guidance of that lamp which God hath afforded us in the Councils\r\nand in the Fathers of the Church, to a rash, self-willed, and arbitrary\r\ninterpretation of the Scriptures, wrested according to the private\r\nopinion of each speculating heretic."\r\n\r\n"I disdain to reply to the charge," replied Warden. "The question at\r\nissue between your Church and mine, is, whether we will be judged by the\r\nHoly Scriptures, or by the devices and decisions of men not less subject\r\nto error than ourselves, and who have defaced our holy religion with\r\nvain devices, reared up idols of stone and wood, in form of those, who,\r\nwhen they lived, were but sinful creatures, to share the worship due\r\nonly to the Creator--established a toll-house betwixt heaven and hell,\r\nthat profitable purgatory of which the Pope keeps the keys, like an\r\niniquitous judge commutes punishment for bribes, and----"\r\n\r\n"Silence, blasphemer," said the Sub-Prior, sternly, "or I will have thy\r\nblatant obloquy stopped with a gag!"\r\n\r\n"Ay," replied Warden, "such is the freedom of the Christian conference\r\nto which Rome\'s priests so kindly invite us!--the gag--the rack--the\r\naxe--is the _ratio ultima Romae_. But know thou, mine ancient friend,\r\nthat the character of thy former companion is not so changed by age, but\r\nthat he still dares to endure for the cause of truth all that thy proud\r\nhierarchy shall dare to inflict."\r\n\r\n"Of that," said the monk, "I nothing doubt--Thou wert ever a lion to\r\nturn against the spear of the hunter, not a stag to be dismayed at the\r\nsound of his bugle."--He walked through the room in silence. "Wellwood,"\r\nhe said at length, "we can no longer be friends. Our faith, our hope,\r\nour anchor on futurity, is no longer the same."\r\n\r\n"Deep is my sorrow that thou speakest truth. May God so judge me," said\r\nthe Reformer, "as I would buy the conversion of a soul like thine with\r\nmy dearest heart\'s blood."\r\n\r\n"To thee, and with better reason, do I return the wish," replied the\r\nSub-Prior; "it is such an arm as thine that should defend the bulwarks\r\nof the Church, and it is now directing the battering-ram against them,\r\nand rendering practicable the breach through which all that is greedy,\r\nand all that is base, and all that is mutable and hot-headed in this\r\ninnovating age, already hope to advance to destruction and to spoil.\r\nBut since such is our fate, that we can no longer fight side by side\r\nas friends, let us at least act as generous enemies. You cannot have\r\nforgotten,\r\n\r\n  \'O gran bonta dei caralieri antiqui!\r\n  Erano nemici, eran\' de fede diversa\'--\r\n\r\nAlthough, perhaps," he added, stopping short in his quotation, "your new\r\nfaith forbids you to reserve a place in your memory, even for what high\r\npoets have recorded of loyal faith and generous sentiment."\r\n\r\n"The faith of Buchanan," replied the preacher, "the faith of Buchanan\r\nand of Beza, cannot be unfriendly to literature. But the poet you have\r\nquoted affords strains fitter for a dissolute court than for a convent."\r\n\r\n"I might retort on your Theodore Beza," said the Sub-Prior, smiling;\r\n"but I hate the judgment that, like the flesh-fly, skims over whatever\r\nis sound, to detect and settle upon some spot which is tainted. But to\r\nthe purpose. If I conduct thee or send thee a prisoner to St. Mary\'s,\r\nthou art to-night a tenant of the dungeon, to-morrow a burden to the\r\ngibbet-tree. If I were to let thee go hence at large, I were thereby\r\nwronging the Holy Church, and breaking mine own solemn vow. Other\r\nresolutions may be adopted in the capital, or better times may speedily\r\nensue. Wilt thou remain a true prisoner upon thy parole, rescue or no\r\nrescue, as is the phrase amongst the warriors of this country? Wilt\r\nthou solemnly promise that thou wilt do so, and at my summons thou wilt\r\npresent thyself before the Abbot and Chapter at Saint Mary\'s, and that\r\nthou wilt not stir from this house above a quarter of a mile in any\r\ndirection? Wilt thou, I say, engage me thy word for this? and such is\r\nthe sure trust which I repose in thy good faith, that thou shalt remain\r\nhere unharmed and unsecured, a prisoner at large, subject only to appear\r\nbefore our court when called upon."\r\n\r\nThe preacher paused--"I am unwilling," he said, "to fetter my native\r\nliberty by any self-adopted engagement. But I am already in your power,\r\nand you may bind me to my answer. By such promise, to abide within\r\na certain limit, and to appear when called upon, I renounce not any\r\nliberty which I at present possess, and am free to exercise; but, on the\r\ncontrary, being in bonds, and at your mercy, I acquire thereby a liberty\r\nwhich I at present possess not. I will therefore accept of thy proffer,\r\nas what is courteously offered on thy part, and may be honourably\r\naccepted on mine."\r\n\r\n"Stay yet," said the Sub-Prior; "one important part of thy engagement is\r\nforgotten--thou art farther to promise, that while thus left at liberty,\r\nthou wilt not preach or teach, directly or indirectly, any of those\r\npestilent heresies by which so many souls have been in this our day won\r\nover from the kingdom of light to the kingdom of darkness."\r\n\r\n"There we break off our treaty," said Warden, firmly--"Wo unto me if I\r\npreach not the Gospel!"\r\n\r\nThe Sub-Prior\'s countenance became clouded, and he again paced the\r\napartment, and muttered, "A plague upon the self-willed fool!" then\r\nstopped short in his walk, and proceeded in his argument.--"Why, by\r\nthine own reasoning, Henry, thy refusal here is but peevish obstinacy.\r\nIt is in my power to place you where your preaching can reach no human\r\near; in promising therefore to abstain from it, you grant nothing which\r\nyou have it in your power to refuse."\r\n\r\n"I know not that," replied Henry Warden; "thou mayest indeed cast me\r\ninto a dungeon, but can I foretell that my Master hath not task-work for\r\nme to perform even in that dreary mansion? The chains of saints have,\r\nere now, been the means of breaking the bonds of Satan. In a prison,\r\nholy Paul found the jailor whom he brought to believe the word of\r\nsalvation, he and all his house."\r\n\r\n"Nay," said the Sub-Prior, in a tone betwixt anger and scorn, "if\r\nyou match yourself with the blessed Apostle, it were time we had\r\ndone--prepare to endure what thy folly, as well as thy heresy,\r\ndeserves.--Bind him, soldier."\r\n\r\nWith proud submission to his fate, and regarding the Sub-Prior with\r\nsomething which almost amounted to a smile of superiority, the preacher\r\nplaced his arms so that the bonds could be again fastened round him.\r\n\r\n"Spare me not," he said to Christie; for even that ruffian hesitated to\r\ndraw the cord straitly.\r\n\r\nThe Sub-Prior, meanwhile, looked at him from under his cowl, which he\r\nhad drawn over his head, and partly over his face, as if he wished to\r\nshade his own emotions. They were those of a huntsman within point-blank\r\nshot of a noble stag, who is yet too much struck with his majesty of\r\nfront and of antler to take aim at him. They were those of a fowler,\r\nwho, levelling his gun at a magnificent eagle, is yet reluctant to use\r\nhis advantage when he sees the noble sovereign of the birds pruning\r\nhimself in proud defiance of whatever may be attempted against him. The\r\nheart of the Sub-Prior (bigoted as he was) relented, and he doubted\r\nif he ought to purchase, by a rigorous discharge of what he deemed his\r\nduty, the remorse he might afterwards feel for the death of one so nobly\r\nindependent in thought and character, the friend, besides, of his own\r\nhappiest years, during which they had, side by side, striven in the\r\nnoble race of knowledge, and indulged their intervals of repose in the\r\nlighter studies of classical and general letters.\r\n\r\nThe Sub-Prior\'s hand pressed his half-o\'ershadowed cheek, and his eye,\r\nmore completely obscured, was bent on the ground, as if to hide the\r\nworkings of his relenting nature.\r\n\r\n"Were but Edward safe from the infection," he thought to\r\nhimself--"Edward, whose eager and enthusiastic mind presses forward in\r\nthe chase of all that hath even the shadow of knowledge, I might trust\r\nthis enthusiast with the women, after due caution to them that they\r\ncannot, without guilt, attend to his reveries."\r\n\r\nAs the Sub-Prior revolved these thoughts, and delayed the definitive\r\norder which was to determine the fate of the prisoner, a sudden noise\r\nat the entrance of the tower diverted his attention for an instant, and,\r\nhis cheek and brow inflamed with all the glow of heat and determination,\r\nEdward Glendinning rushed into the room.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter the Thirty-Second.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Then in my gown of sober gray\r\n    Along the mountain path I\'ll wander,\r\n  And wind my solitary way\r\n    To the sad shrine that courts me yonder.\r\n\r\n  There, in the calm monastic shade,\r\n    All injuries may be forgiven;\r\n  And there for thee, obdurate maid,\r\n    My orisons shall rise to heaven.\r\n          THE CRUEL LADY OF THE MOUNTAINS.\r\n\r\nThe first words which Edward uttered were,--"My brother is safe,\r\nreverend father--he is safe, thank God, and lives!--There is not in\r\nCorri-nan-shian a grave, nor a vestige of a grave. The turf around the\r\nfountain has neither been disturbed by pick-axe, spade, nor mattock,\r\nsince the deer\'s-hair first sprang there. He lives as surely as I live!"\r\n\r\nThe earnestness of the youth--the vivacity with which he looked and\r\nmoved--the springy step, outstretched hand, and ardent eye, reminded\r\nHenry Warden of Halbert, so lately his guide. The brothers had indeed\r\na strong family resemblance, though Halbert was far more athletic and\r\nactive in his person, taller and better knit in the limbs, and though\r\nEdward had, on ordinary occasions, a look of more habitual acuteness\r\nand more profound reflection. The preacher was interested as well as the\r\nSub-Prior.\r\n\r\n"Of whom do you speak, my son?" he said, in a tone as unconcerned as if\r\nhis own fate had not been at the same instant trembling in the balance,\r\nand as if a dungeon and death did not appear to be his instant doom--"Of\r\nwhom, I say, speak you? If of a youth somewhat older than you seem to\r\nbe--brown-haired, open-featured, taller and stronger than you appear,\r\nyet having much of the same air and of the same tone of voice--if such a\r\none is the brother whom you seek, it may be I can tell you news of him."\r\n\r\n"Speak, then, for Heaven\'s sake," said Edward--"life or death lies on\r\nthy tongue!"\r\n\r\nThe Sub-Prior joined eagerly in the same request, and, without waiting\r\nto be urged, the preacher gave so minute an account of the circumstances\r\nunder which he met the elder Glendinning, with so exact a description\r\nof his person, that there remained no doubt as to his identity. When he\r\nmentioned that Halbert Glendinning had conducted him to a dell in which\r\nthey found the grass bloody, and a grave newly closed, and told how\r\nthe youth accused himself of the slaughter of Sir Piercie Shafton, the\r\nSub-Prior looked on Edward with astonishment.\r\n\r\n"Didst thou not say, even now," he said, "that there was no vestige of a\r\ngrave in that spot?"\r\n\r\n"No more vestige of the earth having been removed than if the turf had\r\ngrown there since the days of Adam," replied Edward Glendinning. "It is\r\ntrue," he added, "that the adjacent grass was trampled and bloody."\r\n\r\n"These are delusions of the Enemy," said the Sub-Prior, crossing\r\nhimself.--"Christian men may no longer doubt of it."\r\n\r\n"But an it be so," said Warden, "Christian men might better guard\r\nthemselves by the sword of prayer than by the idle form of a\r\ncabalistical spell."\r\n\r\n"The badge of our salvation," said the Sub-Prior, "cannot be so\r\ntermed--the sign of the cross disarmeth all evil spirits."\r\n\r\n"Ay," answered Henry Warden, apt and armed for controversy, "but it\r\nshould be borne in the heart, not scored with the fingers in the air.\r\nThat very impassive air, through which your hand passes, shall as soon\r\nbear the imprint of your action, as the external action shall avail the\r\nfond bigot who substitutes vain motions of the body, idle genuflections,\r\nand signs of the cross, for the living and heart-born duties of faith\r\nand good works."\r\n\r\n"I pity thee," said the Sub-Prior, as actively ready for polemics as\r\nhimself,--"I pity thee, Henry, and reply not to thee. Thou mayest as\r\nwell winnow forth and measure the ocean with a sieve, as mete out the\r\npower of holy words, deeds, and signs, by the erring gauge of thine own\r\nreason."\r\n\r\n"Not by mine own reason would I mete them," said Warden; "but by His\r\nholy Word, that unfading and unerring lamp of our paths, compared to\r\nwhich human reason is but as a glimmering and fading taper, and your\r\nboasted tradition only a misleading wildfire. Show me your Scripture\r\nwarrant for ascribing virtue to such vain signs and motions!"\r\n\r\n"I offered thee a fair field of debate," said the Sub-Prior, "which thou\r\ndidst refuse. I will not at present resume the controversy."\r\n\r\n"Were these my last accents," said the reformer, "and were they uttered\r\nat the stake, half-choked with smoke, and as the fagots kindled into a\r\nblaze around me, with that last utterance I would testify against the\r\nsuperstitious devices of Rome."\r\n\r\nThe Sub-Prior suppressed with pain the controversial answer which arose\r\nto his lips, and, turning to Edward Glendinning, he said, "there could\r\nbe now no doubt that his mother ought presently to be informed that her\r\nson lived."\r\n\r\n"I told you that two hours since," said Christie of the Clinthill, "an\r\nyou would have believed me. But it seems you are more willing to take\r\nthe word of an old gray sorner, whose life has been spent in pattering\r\nheresy, than mine, though I never rode a foray in my life without duly\r\nsaying my paternoster."\r\n\r\n"Go then," said Father Eustace to Edward; "let thy sorrowing mother know\r\nthat her son is restored to her from the grave, like the child of the\r\nwidow of Zarephath; at the intercession," he added, looking at Henry\r\nWarden, "of the blessed Saint whom I invoked in his behalf."\r\n\r\n"Deceived thyself," said Warden, instantly, "thou art a deceiver of\r\nothers. It was no dead man, no creature of clay, whom the blessed\r\nTishbite invoked, when, stung by the reproach of the Shunamite woman, he\r\nprayed that her son\'s soul might come into him again."\r\n\r\n"It was by his intercession, however," repeated the Sub-Prior; "for\r\nwhat says the Vulgate? Thus it is written: \'_Et exaudivit Dominus vocem\r\nHelie; et reversa est anima pueri intra cum, et revixit_;\'--and thinkest\r\nthou the intercession of a glorified saint is more feeble than when he\r\nwalks on earth, shrouded in a tabernacle of clay, and seeing but with\r\nthe eye of flesh?"\r\n\r\nDuring this controversy Edward Glendinning appeared restless and\r\nimpatient, agitated by some internal feeling, but whether of joy, grief,\r\nor expectation, his countenance did not expressly declare. He took now\r\nthe unusual freedom to break in upon the discourse of the Sub-Prior,\r\nwho, notwithstanding his resolution to the contrary, was obviously\r\nkindling in the spirit of controversy, which Edward diverted by\r\nconjuring his reverence to allow him to speak a few words with him in\r\nprivate.\r\n\r\n"Remove the prisoner," said the Sub-Prior to Christie; "look to him\r\ncarefully that he escape not; but for thy life do him no injury."\r\n\r\nHis commands being obeyed, Edward and the monk were left alone, when the\r\nSub-Prior thus addressed him:\r\n\r\n"What hath come over thee, Edward, that thy eye kindles so wildly, and\r\nthy cheek is thus changing from scarlet to pale? Why didst thou break\r\nin so hastily and unadvisedly upon the argument with which I was\r\nprostrating yonder heretic? And wherefore dost thou not tell thy mother\r\nthat her son is restored to her by the intercession, as Holy Church well\r\nwarrants us to believe, of Blessed Saint Benedict, the patron of our\r\nOrder? For if ever my prayers were put forth to him with zeal, it hath\r\nbeen in behalf of this house, and thine eyes have seen the result--go\r\ntell it to thy mother."\r\n\r\n"I must tell her then," said Edward, "that if she has regained one son,\r\nanother is lost to her."\r\n\r\n"What meanest thou, Edward? what language is this?" said the Sub-Prior.\r\n\r\n"Father," said the youth, kneeling down to him, "my sin and my shame\r\nshall be told thee, and thou shalt witness my penance with thine own\r\neyes."\r\n\r\n"I comprehend thee not," said the Sub-Prior. "What canst thou have done\r\nto deserve such self-accusation?--Hast thou too listened," he added,\r\nknitting his brows, "to the demon of heresy, ever most effectual tempter\r\nof those, who, like yonder unhappy man, are distinguished by their love\r\nof knowledge?"\r\n\r\n"I am guiltless in that matter," answered Glendinning, "nor have\r\npresumed to think otherwise than thou, my kind father, hast taught me,\r\nand than the Church allows."\r\n\r\n"And what is it then, my son," said the Sub-Prior, kindly, "which thus\r\nafflicts thy conscience? speak it to me, that I may answer thee in the\r\nwords of comfort; for the Church\'s mercy is great to those obedient\r\nchildren who doubt not her power."\r\n\r\n"My confession will require her mercy," replied Edward. "My brother\r\nHalbert--so kind, so brave, so gentle, who spoke not, thought not, acted\r\nnot, but in love to me, whose hand had aided me in every difficulty,\r\nwhose eye watched over me like the eagle\'s over her nestlings, when they\r\nprove their first flight from the eyry--this brother, so kind, so gently\r\naffectionate--I heard of his sudden, his bloody, his violent death, and\r\nI rejoiced--I heard of his unexpected restoration, and I sorrowed!"\r\n\r\n"Edward," said the father, "thou art beside thyself--what could urge\r\nthee to such odious ingratitude?--In your hurry of spirits you have\r\nmistaken the confused tenor of your feelings--Go, my son, pray and\r\ncompose thy mind--we will speak of this another time."\r\n\r\n"No, father, no," said Edward, vehemently, "now or never!--I will find\r\nthe means to tame this rebellious heart of mine, or I will tear it\r\nout of my bosom--Mistake its passions?--No, father, grief can ill be\r\nmistaken for joy--All wept, all shrieked around me--my mother--the\r\nmenials--she too, the cause of my crime--all wept--and I--I could\r\nhardly disguise my brutal and insane joy under the appearance of\r\nrevenge--Brother, I said, I cannot give thee tears, but I will give thee\r\nblood--Yes, father, as I counted hour after hour, while I kept watch\r\nupon the English prisoner, and said, I am an hour nearer to hope and to\r\nhappiness----"\r\n\r\n"I understand thee not, Edward," said the monk, "nor can I conceive in\r\nwhat way thy brother\'s supposed murder should have affected thee with\r\nsuch unnatural joy--Surely the sordid desire to succeed him in his small\r\npossessions----"\r\n\r\n"Perish the paltry trash!" said Edward, with the same emotion. "No,\r\nfather, it was rivalry--it was jealous rage--it was the love of Mary\r\nAvenel, that rendered me the unnatural wretch I confess myself!"\r\n\r\n"Of Mary Avenel!" said the Priest--"of a lady so high above either of\r\nyou in name and in rank? How dared Halbert--how dared you, to presume to\r\nlift your eye to her but in honour and respect, as a superior of another\r\ndegree from yours?"\r\n\r\n"When did love wait for the sanction of heraldry?" replied Edward; "and\r\nin what but a line of dead ancestors was Mary, our mother\'s guest and\r\nfoster-child, different from us, with whom she was brought up?--Enough,\r\nwe loved--we both loved her! But the passion of Halbert was requited. He\r\nknew it not, he saw it not--but I was sharper-eyed. I saw that even when\r\nI was more approved, Halbert was more beloved. With me she would sit for\r\nhours at our common task with the cold simplicity and indifference of\r\na sister, but with Halbert she trusted not herself. She changed colour,\r\nshe was fluttered when he approached her; and when he left her, she was\r\nsad, pensive, and solitary. I bore all this--I saw my rival\'s advancing\r\nprogress in her affections--I bore it, father, and yet I hated him\r\nnot--I could not hate him!"\r\n\r\n"And well for thee that thou didst not," said the father; "wild and\r\nheadstrong as thou art, wouldst thou hate thy brother for partaking in\r\nthine own folly?"\r\n\r\n"Father," replied Edward, "the world esteems thee wise, and holds thy\r\nknowledge of mankind high; but thy question shows that thou hast never\r\nloved. It was by an effort that I saved myself from hating my kind\r\nand affectionate brother, who, all unsuspicious of my rivalry, was\r\nperpetually loading me with kindness. Nay, there were moods of my\r\nmind, in which I could return that kindness for a time with energetic\r\nenthusiasm. Never did I feel this so strongly as on the night which\r\nparted us. But I could not help rejoicing when he was swept from my\r\npath--could not help sorrowing when he was again restored to be a\r\nstumbling-block in my paths."\r\n\r\n"May God be gracious to thee, my son!" said the monk; "this is an awful\r\nstate of mind. Even in such evil mood did the first murderer rise up\r\nagainst his brother, because Abel\'s was the more acceptable sacrifice."\r\n\r\n"I will wrestle with the demon which has haunted me, father," replied\r\nthe youth, firmly--"I will wrestle with him, and I will subdue him. But\r\nfirst I must remove from the scenes which are to follow here. I cannot\r\nendure that I should see Mary Avenel\'s eyes again flash with joy at the\r\nrestoration of her lover. It were a sight to make indeed a second Cain\r\nof me! My fierce, turbid, and transitory joy discharged itself in a\r\nthirst to commit homicide, and how can I estimate the frenzy of my\r\ndespair?"\r\n\r\n"Madman!" said the Sub-Prior, "at what dreadful crime does thy fury\r\ndrive?"\r\n\r\n"My lot is determined, father," said Edward, in a resolute tone; "I will\r\nembrace the spiritual state which you have so oft recommended. It is my\r\npurpose to return with you to Saint Mary\'s, and, with the permission\r\nof the Holy Virgin and of Saint Benedict, to offer my profession to the\r\nAbbot."\r\n\r\n"Not now, my son," said the Sub-Prior, "not in this distemperature\r\nof mind. The wise and good accept not gifts which are made in heat\r\nof blood, and which may be after repented of; and shall we make\r\nour offerings to wisdom and to goodness itself with less of solemn\r\nresolution and deep devotion of mind, than is necessary to make them\r\nacceptable to our own frail companions in this valley of darkness? This\r\nI say to thee, my son, not as meaning to deter thee from the good path\r\nthou art now inclined to prefer, but that thou mayst make thy vocation\r\nand thine election sure."\r\n\r\n"There are actions, father," returned Edward, "which brook no delay, and\r\nthis is one. It must be done this very _now_; or it may never be done.\r\nLet me go with you; let me not behold the return of Halbert into this\r\nhouse. Shame, and the sense of the injustice I have already done him,\r\nwill join with these dreadful passions which urge me to do him yet\r\nfarther wrong. Let me then go with you."\r\n\r\n"With me, my son," said the Sub-Prior, "thou shalt surely go; but our\r\nrule, as well as reason and good order, require that you should dwell a\r\nspace with us as a probationer, or novice, before taking upon thee those\r\nfinal vows, which, sequestering thee for ever from the world, dedicate\r\nthee to the service of Heaven."\r\n\r\n"And when shall we set forth, father?" said the youth, as eagerly as\r\nif the journey which he was now undertaking led to the pleasures of a\r\nsummer holiday.\r\n\r\n"Even now, if thou wilt," said the Sub-Prior, yielding to his\r\nimpetuosity--"go, then, and command them to prepare for our\r\ndeparture.--Yet stay," he said, as Edward, with all the awakened\r\nenthusiasm of his character, hastened from his presence, "come hither,\r\nmy son, and kneel down."\r\n\r\nEdward obeyed, and kneeled down before him. Notwithstanding his slight\r\nfigure and thin features, the Sub-Prior could, from the energy of his\r\ntone, and the earnestness of his devotional manner, impress his pupils\r\nand his penitents with no ordinary feelings of personal reverence. His\r\nheart always was, as well as seemed to be, in the duty which he was\r\nimmediately performing; and the spiritual guide who thus shows a deep\r\nconviction of the importance of his office, seldom fails to impress a\r\nsimilar feeling upon his hearers. Upon such occasions as the present,\r\nhis puny body seemed to assume more majestic stature--his spare and\r\nemaciated countenance bore a bolder, loftier, and more commanding\r\nport--his voice, always beautiful, trembled as labouring under the\r\nimmediate impulse of the Divinity--and his whole demeanour seemed to\r\nbespeak, not the mere ordinary man, but the organ of the Church in which\r\nshe had vested her high power for delivering sinners from their load of\r\niniquity.\r\n\r\n"Hast thou, my fair son," said he, "faithfully recounted the\r\ncircumstances which have thus suddenly determined thee to a religious\r\nlife?"\r\n\r\n"The sins I have confessed, my father," answered Edward, "but I have\r\nnot yet told of a strange appearance, which, acting in my mind, hath, I\r\nthink, aided to determine my resolution."\r\n\r\n"Tell it, then, now," returned the Sub-Prior; "it is thy duty to\r\nleave me uninstructed in nought, so that thereby I may understand the\r\ntemptation that besets thee."\r\n\r\n"I tell it with unwillingness," said Edward; "for although, God wot, I\r\nspeak but the mere truth, yet even while my tongue speaks it as truth,\r\nmy own ears receive it as fable."\r\n\r\n"Yet say the whole," said Father Eustace; "neither fear rebuke from me,\r\nseeing I may know reasons for receiving as true that which others might\r\nregard as fabulous."\r\n\r\n"Know, then, father," replied Edward, "that betwixt hope and\r\ndespair--and, heavens! what a hope!--the hope to find the corpse mangled\r\nand crushed hastily in amongst the bloody clay which the foot of the\r\nscornful victor had trod down upon my good, my gentle, my courageous\r\nbrother,--I sped to the glen called Corri-nan-shian; but, as your\r\nreverence has been already informed, neither the grave, which my\r\nunhallowed wishes had in spite of my better self longed to see, nor any\r\nappearance of the earth having been opened, was visible in the solitary\r\nspot where Martin had, at morning yesterday, seen the fatal hillock.\r\nYou know your dalesmen, father. The place hath an evil name, and this\r\ndeception of the sight inclined them to leave it. My companions became\r\naffrighted, and hastened down the glen as men caught in trespass. My\r\nhopes were too much blighted, my mind too much agitated, to fear either\r\nthe living or the dead. I descended the glen more slowly than they,\r\noften looking back, and not ill pleased with the poltroonery of my\r\ncompanions, which left me to my own perplexed and moody humour, and\r\ninduced them to hasten into the broader dale. They were already out of\r\nsight, and lost amongst the windings of the glen, when, looking back, I\r\nsaw a female form standing beside the fountain----"\r\n\r\n"How, my fair son?" said the Sub-Prior, "beware you jest not with your\r\npresent situation!"\r\n\r\n"I jest not, father," answered the youth; "it may be I shall never jest\r\nagain--surely not for many a day. I saw, I say, the form of a female\r\nclad in white, such as the Spirit which haunts the house of Avenel is\r\nsupposed to be. Believe me, my father, for, by heaven and earth, I say\r\nnought but what I saw with these eyes!"\r\n\r\n"I believe thee, my son," said the monk; "proceed in thy strange story."\r\n\r\n"The apparition," said Edward Glendinning, "sung, and thus ran her lay;\r\nfor, strange as it may seem to you, her words abide by my remembrance as\r\nif they had been sung to me from infancy upward:--\r\n\r\n  \'Thou who seek\'st my fountain lone,\r\n  With thoughts and hopes thou dar\'st not own;\r\n  Whose heart within leap\'d wildly glad\r\n  When most his brow seem\'d dark and sad;\r\n  Hie thee back, thou find\'st not here\r\n  Corpse or coffin, grave or bier;\r\n  The Dead Alive is gone and fled--\r\n  Go thou, and join the Living Dead!\r\n\r\n  \'The Living Dead, whose sober brow\r\n  Oft shrouds such thoughts as thou hast now,\r\n  Whose hearts within are seldom cured\r\n  Of passions by their vows abjured;\r\n  Where, under sad and solemn show,\r\n  Vain hopes are nursed, wild wishes glow.\r\n  Seek the convent\'s vaulted room,\r\n  Prayer and vigil be thy doom;\r\n  Doff the green, and don the gray,\r\n  To the cloister hence away!\'"\r\n\r\n"\'Tis a wild lay," said the Sub-Prior, "and chanted, I fear me, with\r\nno good end. But we have power to turn the machinations of Satan to his\r\nshame. Edward, thou shalt go with me as thou desirest; thou shalt prove\r\nthe life for which I have long thought thee best fitted--thou shalt aid,\r\nmy son, this trembling hand of mine to sustain the Holy Ark, which bold\r\nunhallowed men press rashly forward to touch and to profane.--Wilt thou\r\nnot first see thy mother?"\r\n\r\n"I will see no one," said Edward, hastily; "I will risk nothing that\r\nmay shake the purpose of my heart. From Saint Mary\'s they shall learn\r\nmy destination--all of them shall learn it. My mother--Mary Avenel--my\r\nrestored and happy brother--they shall all know that Edward lives no\r\nlonger to the world to be a clog on their happiness. Mary shall no\r\nlonger need to constrain her looks and expressions to coldness because I\r\nam nigh. She shall no longer----"\r\n\r\n"My son," said the Sub-Prior, interrupting him, "it is not by looking\r\nback on the vanities and vexations of this world, that we fit ourselves\r\nfor the discharge of duties which are not of it. Go, get our horses\r\nready, and, as we descend the glen together, I will teach thee the\r\ntruths through which the fathers and wise men of old had that precious\r\nalchemy, which can convert suffering into happiness."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter the Thirty-Third.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Now, on my faith, this gear is all entangled,\r\n  Like to the yarn-clew of the drowsy knitter,\r\n  Dragg\'d by the frolic kitten through the cabin,\r\n  While the good dame sits nodding o\'er the fire!\r\n  Masters, attend; \'twill crave some skill to clear it.\r\n                                       OLD PLAY.\r\n\r\nEdward, with the speed of one who doubts the steadiness of his own\r\nresolution, hastened to prepare the horses for their departure, and at\r\nthe same time thanked and dismissed the neighbours who had come to his\r\nassistance, and who were not a little surprised both at the suddenness\r\nof his proposed departure, and at the turn affairs had taken.\r\n\r\n"Here\'s cold hospitality," quoth Dan of the Howlet-hirst to his\r\ncomrades; "I trow the Glendinnings may die and come alive right oft, ere\r\nI put foot in stirrup again for the matter."\r\n\r\nMartin soothed them by placing food and liquor before them. They ate\r\nsullenly, however, and departed in bad humour.\r\n\r\nThe joyful news that Halbert Glendinning lived, was quickly communicated\r\nthrough the sorrowing family. The mother wept and thanked Heaven\r\nalternately; until her habits of domestic economy awakening as her\r\nfeelings became calmer, she observed, "It would be an unco task to\r\nmend the yetts, and what were they to do while they were broken in that\r\nfashion? At open doors dogs come in."\r\n\r\nTibb remarked, "She aye thought Halbert was ower gleg at his weapon to\r\nbe killed sae easily by ony Sir Piercie of them a\'. They might say of\r\nthese Southrons as they liked; but they had not the pith and wind of a\r\ncanny Scot, when it came to close grips."\r\n\r\nOn Mary Avenel the impression was inconceivably deeper. She had but\r\nnewly learned to pray, and it seemed to her that her prayers had been\r\ninstantly answered--that the compassion of Heaven, which she had learned\r\nto implore in the words of Scripture, had descended upon her after a\r\nmanner almost miraculous, and recalled the dead from the grave at the\r\nsound of her lamentations. There was a dangerous degree of enthusiasm in\r\nthis strain of feeling, but it originated in the purest devotion.\r\n\r\nA silken and embroidered muffler, one of the few articles of more costly\r\nattire which she possessed, was devoted to the purpose of wrapping up\r\nand concealing the sacred volume, which henceforth she was to regard\r\nas her chiefest treasure, lamenting only that, for want of a fitting\r\ninterpreter, much must remain to her a book closed and a fountain\r\nsealed. She was unaware of the yet greater danger she incurred, of\r\nputting an imperfect or even false sense upon some of the doctrines\r\nwhich appeared most comprehensible. But Heaven had provided against both\r\nthese hazards.\r\n\r\nWhile Edward was preparing the horses, Christie of the Clinthill again\r\nsolicited his orders respecting the reformed preacher, Henry Warden,\r\nand again the worthy monk laboured to reconcile in his own mind the\r\ncompassion and esteem which, almost in spite of him, he could not help\r\nfeeling for his former companion, with the duty which he owed to the\r\nChurch. The unexpected resolution of Edward had removed, he thought, the\r\nchief objection to his being left at Glendearg.\r\n\r\n"If I carry this Well-wood, or Warden, to the Monastery." he thought,\r\n"he must die--die in his heresy--perish body and soul. And though such a\r\nmeasure was once thought advisable, to strike terror into the heretics,\r\nyet such is now their daily increasing strength, that it may rather\r\nrouse them to fury and to revenge. True, he refuses to pledge himself\r\nto abstain from sowing his tares among the wheat; but the ground here\r\nis too barren to receive them. I fear not his making impression on these\r\npoor women, the vassals of the Church, and bred up in due obedience to\r\nher behests. The keen, searching, inquiring, and bold disposition of\r\nEdward, might have afforded fuel to the fire; but that is removed, and\r\nthere is nothing left which the flame may catch to.--Thus shall he have\r\nno power to spread his evil doctrines abroad, and yet his life shall be\r\npreserved, and it may be his soul rescued as a prey from the fowler\'s\r\nnet. I will myself contend with him in argument; for when we studied in\r\ncommon, I yielded not to him, and surely the cause for which I struggle\r\nwill support me, were I yet more weak than I deem myself. Were this man\r\nreclaimed from his errors, an hundred-fold more advantage would arise\r\nto the Church from his spiritual regeneration, than from his temporal\r\ndeath."\r\n\r\nHaving finished these meditations, in which there was at once goodness\r\nof disposition and narrowness of principle, a considerable portion\r\nof self-opinion, and no small degree of self-delusion, the Sub-Prior\r\ncommanded the prisoner to be brought into his presence.\r\n\r\n"Henry," he said, "whatever a rigid sense of duty may demand of me,\r\nancient friendship and Christian compassion forbid me to lead thee to\r\nassured death. Thou wert wont to be generous, though stern and stubborn\r\nin thy resolves; let not thy sense of what thine own thoughts term duty,\r\ndraw thee farther than mine have done. Remember, that every sheep whom\r\nthou shalt here lead astray from the fold, will be demanded in time and\r\nthrough eternity of him who hath left thee the liberty of doing such\r\nevil. I ask no engagement of thee, save that thou remain a prisoner on\r\nthy word at this tower, and wilt appear when summoned."\r\n\r\n"Thou hast found an invention to bind my hands," replied the preacher,\r\n"more sure than would have been the heaviest shackles in the prison\r\nof thy convent. I will not rashly do what may endanger thee with thy\r\nunhappy superiors, and I will be the more cautious, because, if we had\r\nfarther opportunity of conference, I trust thine own soul may yet be\r\nrescued as a brand from the burning, and that, casting from thee the\r\nlivery of Anti-Christ, that trader in human sins and human souls, I may\r\nyet assist thee to lay hold on the Rock of Ages."\r\n\r\nThe Sub-Prior heard the sentiment, so similar to that which had occurred\r\nto himself, with the same kindly feelings with which the game-cock hears\r\nand replies to the challenge of his rival.\r\n\r\n"I bless God and Our Lady," said he, drawing himself up, "that my\r\nfaith is already anchored on that Rock on which Saint Peter founded his\r\nChurch."\r\n\r\n"It is a perversion of the text," said the eager Henry Warden, "grounded\r\non a vain play upon words--a most idle paronomasia."\r\n\r\nThe controversy would have been rekindled, and in all probability--for\r\nwhat can insure the good temper and moderation of polemics?--might have\r\nended in the preacher\'s being transported a captive to the Monastery,\r\nhad not Christie of the Clinthill observed that it was growing late, and\r\nthat he, having to descend the glen, which had no good reputation, cared\r\nnot greatly for travelling there after sunset. The Sub-Prior, therefore,\r\nstifled his desire of argument, and again telling the preacher, that he\r\ntrusted to his gratitude and generosity, he bade him farewell.\r\n\r\n"Be assured, my old friend," replied Warden, "that no willing act of\r\nmine shall be to thy prejudice. But if my Master shall place work before\r\nme, I must obey God rather than man."\r\n\r\nThese two men, both excellent from natural disposition and acquired\r\nknowledge, had more points of similarity than they themselves would have\r\nadmitted. In truth, the chief distinction betwixt them was, that the\r\nCatholic, defending a religion which afforded little interest to the\r\nfeelings, had, in his devotion to the cause he espoused, more of the\r\nhead than of the heart, and was politic, cautious, and artful; while\r\nthe Protestant, acting under the strong impulse of more lately-adopted\r\nconviction, and feeling, as he justly might, a more animated confidence\r\nin his cause, was enthusiastic, eager, and precipitate in his desire to\r\nadvance it. The priest would have been contented to defend, the preacher\r\naspired to conquer; and, of course, the impulse by which the latter was\r\ngoverned, was more active and more decisive. They could not part from\r\neach other without a second pressure of hands, and each looked in the\r\nface of his old companion, as he bade him adieu, with a countenance\r\nstrongly expressive of sorrow, affection, and pity.\r\n\r\nFather Eustace then explained briefly to Dame Glendinning, that this\r\nperson was to be her guest for some days, forbidding her and her whole\r\nhousehold, under high spiritual censures, to hold any conversation with\r\nhim on religious subjects, but commanding her to attend to his wants in\r\nall other particulars.\r\n\r\n"May Our Lady forgive me, reverend father," said Dame Glendinning,\r\nsomewhat dismayed at this intelligence, "but I must needs say, that ower\r\nmony guests have been the ruin of mony a house, and I trow they will\r\nbring down Glendearg. First came the Lady of Avenel--(her soul be at\r\nrest--she meant nae ill)--but she brought with her as mony bogles and\r\nfairies, as hae kept the house in care ever since, sae that we have been\r\nliving as it were in a dream. And then came that English knight, if it\r\nplease you, and if he hasna killed my son outright, he has chased him\r\naff the gate, and it may be lang eneugh ere I see him again--forby the\r\ndamage done to outer door and inner door. And now your reverence has\r\ngiven me the charge of a heretic, who, it is like, may bring the great\r\nhorned devil himself down upon us all; and they say that it is neither\r\ndoor nor window will serve him, but he will take away the side of the\r\nauld tower along with him. Nevertheless, reverend father, your pleasure\r\nis doubtless to be done to our power."\r\n\r\n"Go to, woman," said the Sub-Prior; "send for workmen from the clachan,\r\nand let them charge the expense of their repairs to the Community, and I\r\nwill give the treasurer warrant to allow them. Moreover, in settling the\r\nrental mails, and feu-duties, thou shalt have allowance for the trouble\r\nand charges to which thou art now put, and I will cause strict search to\r\nbe made after thy son."\r\n\r\nThe dame curtsied deep and low at each favourable expression; and when\r\nthe Sub-Prior had done speaking, she added her farther hope that\r\nthe Sub-Prior would hold some communing with her gossip the Miller,\r\nconcerning the fate of his daughter, and expound to him that the chance\r\nhad by no means happened through any negligence on her part.\r\n\r\n"I sair doubt me, father," she said, "whether Mysie finds her way back\r\nto the Mill in a hurry; but it was all her father\'s own fault that let\r\nher run lamping about the country, riding on bare-backed naigs, and\r\nnever settling to do a turn of wark within doors, unless it were to\r\ndress dainties at dinner-time for his ain kyte."\r\n\r\n"You remind me, dame, of another matter of urgency," said Father\r\nEustace; "and, God knows, too many of them press on me at this moment.\r\nThis English knight must be sought out, and explanation given to him of\r\nthese most strange chances. The giddy girl must also be recovered. If\r\nshe hath suffered in reputation by this unhappy mistake, I will not hold\r\nmyself innocent of the disgrace. Yet how to find them out I know not."\r\n\r\n"So please you," said Christie of the Clinthill, "I am willing to take\r\nthe chase, and bring them back by fair means or foul; for though\r\nyou have always looked as black as night at me, whenever we have\r\nforgathered, yet I have not forgotten that had it not been for you,\r\nmy neck would have kend the weight of my four quarters. If any man\r\ncan track the tread of them, I will say in the face of both Merse and\r\nTeviotdale, and take the Forest to boot, I am that man. But first I have\r\nmatters to treat of on my master\'s score, if you will permit me to ride\r\ndown the glen with you."\r\n\r\n"Nay, but my friend," said the Sub-Prior, "thou shouldst remember I\r\nhave but slender cause to trust thee for a companion through a place so\r\nsolitary."\r\n\r\n"Tush! tush!" said the Jackman, "fear me not; I had the worst too surely\r\nto begin that sport again. Besides, have I not said a dozen of times,\r\nI owe you a life? and when I owe a man either a good turn or a bad, I\r\nnever fail to pay it sooner or later. Moreover, beshrew me if I care to\r\ngo alone down the glen, or even with my troopers, who are, every loon\r\nof them, as much devil\'s bairns as myself; whereas, if your reverence,\r\nsince that is the word, take beads and psalter, and I come along with\r\njack and spear, you will make the devils take the air, and I will make\r\nall human enemies take the earth."\r\n\r\nEdward here entered, and told his reverence that his horse was prepared.\r\nAt this instant his eye caught his mother\'s, and the resolution which he\r\nhad so strongly formed was staggered when he recollected the necessity\r\nof bidding her farewell. The Sub-Prior saw his embarrassment, and came\r\nto his relief.\r\n\r\n"Dame," said he, "I forgot to mention that your son Edward goes with me\r\nto Saint Mary\'s, and will not return for two or three days."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll be wishing to help him to recover his brother? May the saints\r\nreward your kindness!"\r\n\r\nThe Sub-Prior returned the benediction which, in this instance, he had\r\nnot very well deserved, and he and Edward set forth on their route. They\r\nwere presently followed by Christie, who came up with his followers at\r\nsuch a speedy pace, as intimated sufficiently that his wish to obtain\r\nspiritual convoy through the glen, was extremely sincere. He had,\r\nhowever, other matters to stimulate his speed, for he was desirous to\r\ncommunicate to the Sub-Prior a message from his master Julian, connected\r\nwith the delivery of the prisoner Warden; and having requested the\r\nSub-Prior to ride with him a few yards before Edward, and the troopers\r\nof his own party, he thus addressed him, sometimes interrupting his\r\ndiscourse in a manner testifying that his fear of supernatural beings\r\nwas not altogether lulled to rest by his confidence in the sanctity of\r\nhis fellow-traveller.\r\n\r\n"My master," said the rider, "deemed he had sent you an acceptable gift\r\nin that old heretic preacher; but it seems, from the slight care you\r\nhave taken of him, that you make small account of the boon."\r\n\r\n"Nay," said the Sub-Prior, "do not thus judge of it. The Community\r\nmust account highly of the service, and will reward it to thy master in\r\ngoodly fashion. But this man and I are old friends, and I trust to bring\r\nhim back from the paths of perdition."\r\n\r\n"Nay," said the moss-trooper, "when I saw you shake hands at the\r\nbeginning I counted that you would fight it all out in love and honour,\r\nand that there would be no extreme dealings betwixt ye--however it is\r\nall one to my master--Saint Mary! what call you yon, Sir Monk?"\r\n\r\n"The branch of a willow streaming across the path betwixt us and the\r\nsky."\r\n\r\n"Beshrew me," said Christie, "if it looked not like a man\'s hand holding\r\na sword.--But touching my master, he, like a prudent man, hath kept\r\nhimself aloof in these broken times, until he could see with precision\r\nwhat footing he was to stand upon. Right tempting offers he hath had\r\nfrom the Lords of Congregation, whom you call heretics; and at one time\r\nhe was minded, to be plain with you, to have taken their way--for he was\r\nassured that the Lord James [Footnote: Lord James Stewart, afterwards\r\nthe Regent Murray.] was coming this road at the head of a round body of\r\ncavalry. And accordingly Lord James did so far reckon upon him, that\r\nhe sent this man Warden, or whatsoever be his name, to my master\'s\r\nprotection, as an assured friend; and, moreover, with tidings that he\r\nhimself was marching hitherward at the head of a strong body of horse."\r\n\r\n"Now, Our Lady forfend!" said the Sub-Prior.\r\n\r\n"Amen!" answered Christie, in some trepidation, "did your reverence see\r\naught?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing whatever," replied the monk; "it was thy tale which wrested\r\nfrom me that exclamation."\r\n\r\n"And it was some cause," replied he of the Clinthill, "for if Lord James\r\nshould come hither, your Halidome would smoke for it. But be of good\r\ncheer--that expedition is ended before it was begun. The Baron of Avenel\r\nhad sure news that Lord James has been fain to march westward with his\r\nmerry-men, to protect Lord Semple against Cassilis and the Kennedies.\r\nBy my faith, it will cost him a brush; for wot ye what they say of that\r\nname,--\r\n\r\n  "Twixt Wigton and the town of Ayr,\r\n    Portpatrick and the cruives of Cree,\r\n  No man need think for to bide there,\r\n    Unless he court Saint Kennedie.\'"\r\n\r\n"Then," said the Sub-Prior, "the Lord James\'s purpose of coming\r\nsouthwards being broken, cost this person, Henry Warden, a cold\r\nreception at Avenel Castle."\r\n\r\n"It would not have been altogether so rough a one," said the\r\nmosstrooper; "for my master was in heavy thought what to do in these\r\nunsettled times, and would scarce have hazarded misusing a man sent to\r\nhim by so terrible a leader as the Lord James. But, to speak the truth,\r\nsome busy devil tempted the old man to meddle with my master\'s Christian\r\nliberty of hand-fasting with Catherine of Newport. So that broke the\r\nwand of peace between them, and now ye may have my master, and all the\r\nforce he can make, at your devotion, for Lord James never forgave wrong\r\ndone to him; and if he come by the upper hand, he will have Julian\'s\r\nhead if there were never another of the name, as it is like there is\r\nnot, excepting the bit slip of a lassie yonder. And now I have told you\r\nmore of my master\'s affairs than he would thank me for; but you have\r\ndone me a frank turn once, and I may need one at your hands again."\r\n\r\n"Thy frankness," said the Sub-Prior, "shall surely advantage thee; for\r\nmuch it concerns the Church in these broken times to know the purposes\r\nand motives of those around us. But what is it that thy master expects\r\nfrom us in reward of good service? for I esteem him one of those who are\r\nnot willing to work without their hire."\r\n\r\n"Nay, that I can tell you flatly; for Lord James had promised him, in\r\ncase he would be of his faction in these parts, an easy tack of the\r\nteindsheaves of his own Barony of Avenel, together with the lands of\r\nCranberry-moor, which lie intersected with his own. And he will look for\r\nno less at your hand."\r\n\r\n"But there is old Gilbert of Cranberry-moor," said the Sub-Prior; "what\r\nare we to make of him? The heretic Lord James may take on him to dispone\r\nupon the goods and lands of the Halidome at his pleasure, because,\r\ndoubtless, but for the protection of God, and the baronage which yet\r\nremain faithful to their creed, he may despoil us of them by force; but\r\nwhile they are the property of the Community, we may not take steadings\r\nfrom ancient and faithful vassals, to gratify the covetousness of those\r\nwho serve God only from the lucre of gain."\r\n\r\n"By the mass," said Christie, "it is well talking, Sir Priest; but when\r\nye consider that Gilbert has but two half-starved cowardly peasants to\r\nfollow him, and only an auld jaded aver to ride upon, fitter for the\r\nplough than for manly service; and that the Baron of Avenel never rides\r\nwith fewer than ten jackmen at his back, and oftener with fifty, bodin\r\nin all that effeirs to war as if they were to do battle for a kingdom,\r\nand mounted on nags that nicker at the clash of the sword as if it were\r\nthe clank of the lid of a corn-chest--I say, when ye have computed all\r\nthis, ye may guess what course will best serve your Monastery."\r\n\r\n"Friend," said the monk, "I would willingly purchase thy master\'s\r\nassistance on his own terms, since times leave us no better means of\r\ndefence against sacrilegious spoliation of heresy; but to take from a\r\npoor man his patrimony--"\r\n\r\n"For that matter," said the rider, "his seat would scarce be a soft one,\r\nif my master thought that Gilbert\'s interest stood betwixt him and what\r\nhe wishes. The Halidome has land enough, and Gilbert may be quartered\r\nelsewhere."\r\n\r\n"We will consider the possibility of so disposing the matter," said\r\nthe monk, "and will expect in consequence your master\'s most active\r\nassistance, with all the followers he can make, to join in the defence\r\nof the Halidome, against any force by which it may be threatened."\r\n\r\n"A man\'s hand and a mailed glove on that," said the jackman. "They\r\n\r\n[Footnote: As some atonement for their laxity of morals on most\r\noccasions, the Borderers were severe observers of the faith which they\r\nhad pledged, even to an enemy. If any person broke his word so plighted,\r\nthe individual to whom faith had not been observed, used to bring to the\r\nnext Border-meeting a glove hung on the point of a spear, and proclaim\r\nto Scots and English the name of the defaulter. This was accounted\r\nso great a disgrace to all connected with him, that his own clansmen\r\nsometimes destroyed him, to escape the infamy he had brought on them.\r\n\r\nConstable, a spy engaged by Sir Ralph Sadler, talks of two Border\r\nthieves, whom he used as his guides:--"That they would not care to\r\nsteal, and yet that they would not betray any man that trusts in them,\r\nfor all the gold in Scotland or in France. They are my guides and\r\noutlaws. If they would betray me they might get their pardons, and cause\r\nme to be hanged; but I have tried them ere this."--_Sadler\'s letters\r\nduring the Northern Insurrection._]\r\n\r\ncall us marauders, thieves, and what not; but the side we take we hold\r\nby.--And I will be blithe when my Baron comes to a point which side he\r\nwill take, for the castle is a kind of hell, (Our Lady forgive me for\r\nnaming such a word in this place!) while he is in his mood, studying how\r\nhe may best advantage himself. And now, Heaven be praised, we are in\r\nthe open valley, and I may swear a round oath, should aught happen to\r\nprovoke it."\r\n\r\n"My friend," said the Sub-Prior, "thou hast little merit in abstaining\r\nfrom oaths or blasphemy, if it be only out of fear of evil spirits."\r\n\r\n"Nay, I am not quite a Church vassal yet," said the jackman, "and if\r\nyou link the curb too tight on a young horse, I promise you he will\r\nrear--Why, it is much for me to forbear old customs on any account\r\nwhatever."\r\n\r\nThe night being fine, they forded the river at the spot where the\r\nSacristan met with his unhappy encounter with the spirit. As soon as\r\nthey arrived at the gate of the Monastery, the porter in waiting eagerly\r\nexclaimed, "Reverend father, the Lord Abbot is most anxious for your\r\npresence."\r\n\r\n"Let these strangers be carried to the great hall," said the Sub-Prior,\r\n"and be treated with the best by the cellarer; reminding them, however,\r\nof that modesty and decency of conduct which becometh guests in a house\r\nlike this."\r\n\r\n"But the Lord Abbot demands you instantly, my venerable brother,"\r\nsaid Father Philip, arriving in great haste. "I have not seen him more\r\ndiscouraged or desolate of counsel since the field of Pinkie-cleugh was\r\nstricken."\r\n\r\n"I come, my good brother, I come," said Father Eustace. "I pray thee,\r\ngood brother, let this youth, Edward Glendinning, be conveyed to the\r\nChamber of the Novices, and placed under their instructor. God hath\r\ntouched his heart, and he proposeth laying aside the vanities of the\r\nworld, to become a brother of our holy order; which, if his good parts\r\nbe matched with fitting docility and humility, he may one day live to\r\nadorn."\r\n\r\n"My very venerable brother," exclaimed old Father Nicholas, who came\r\nhobbling with a third summons to the Sub-Prior, "I pray thee to hasten\r\nto our worshipful Lord Abbot. The holy patroness be with us! never saw\r\nI Abbot of the House of St. Mary\'s in such consternation; and yet I\r\nremember me well when Father Ingelram had the news of Flodden-field."\r\n\r\n"I come, I come, venerable brother," said Father Eustace--And having\r\nrepeatedly ejaculated "I come!" he at last went to the Abbot in good\r\nearnest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter the Thirty-Fourth.\r\n\r\n\r\n  It is not texts will do it--Church artillery\r\n  Are silenced soon by real ordnance,\r\n  And canons are but vain opposed to cannon.\r\n  Go, coin your crosier, melt your church plate down\r\n  Bid the starved soldier banquet in your halls,\r\n  And quaff your long-saved hogsheads--Turn them out\r\n  Thus primed with your good cheer, to guard your wall,\r\n  And they will venture for\'t.--\r\n                                 OLD PLAY.\r\n\r\nThe Abbot received his counsellor with a tremulous eagerness of welcome,\r\nwhich announced to the Sub-Prior an extreme agitation of spirits,\r\nand the utmost need of good counsel. There was neither mazer-dish nor\r\nstanding-cup upon the little table, at the elbow of his huge chair\r\nof state; his beads alone lay there, and it seemed as if he had been\r\ntelling them in his extremity of distress. Beside the beads was placed\r\nthe mitre of the Abbot, of an antique form, and blazing with precious\r\nstones, and the rich and highly-embossed crosier rested against the same\r\ntable.\r\n\r\nThe Sacristan and old Father Nicholas had followed the Sub-Prior into\r\nthe Abbot\'s apartment, perhaps with the hope of learning something\r\nof the important matter which seemed to be in hand.--They were not\r\nmistaken; for, after having ushered in the Sub-Prior, and being\r\nthemselves in the act of retiring, the Abbot made them a signal to\r\nremain.\r\n\r\n"My brethren," he said, "it is well known to you with what painful zeal\r\nwe have overseen the weighty affairs of this house committed to our\r\nunworthy hand--your bread hath been given to you, and your water\r\nhath been sure--I have not wasted the revenues of the Convent on vain\r\npleasures, as hunting or hawking, or in change of rich cope or alb, or\r\nin feasting idle bards and jesters, saving those who, according to old\r\nwont, were received in time of Christmas and Easter. Neither have I\r\nenriched either mine own relations nor strange women, at the expense of\r\nthe Patrimony."\r\n\r\n"There hath not been such a Lord Abbot," said Father Nicholas, "to my\r\nknowledge, since the days of Abbot Ingelram, who----"\r\n\r\nAt that portentous word, which always preluded a long story, the Abbot\r\nbroke in.\r\n\r\n"May God have mercy on his soul!--we talk not of him now.--What I would\r\nknow of ye, my brethren, is, whether I have, in your mind, faithfully\r\ndischarged the duties of mine office?"\r\n\r\n"There has never been subject of complaint," answered the Sub-Prior.\r\n\r\nThe Sacristan, more diffuse, enumerated the various acts of indulgence\r\nand kindness which the mild government of Abbot Boniface had\r\nconferred on the brotherhood of Saint Mary\'s--the _indulgentiae_--the\r\n_gratias_--the _biberes_-the weekly mess of boiled almonds--the\r\nenlarged accommodation of the refectory--the better arrangement of\r\nthe cellarage--the improvement of the revenue of the Monastery--the\r\ndiminution of the privations of the brethren.\r\n\r\n"You might have added, my brother," said the Abbot, listening with\r\nmelancholy acquiescence to the detail of his own merits, "that I caused\r\nto be built that curious screen, which secureth the cloisters from the\r\nnorth-east wind.--But all these things avail nothing--As we read in holy\r\nMaccabee, _Capta est civitas per voluntatem Dei_. It hath cost me no\r\nlittle thought, no common toil, to keep these weighty matters in such\r\norder as you have seen them--there was both barn and binn to be kept\r\nfull--Infirmary, dormitory, guest-hall, and refectory, to be looked\r\nto--processions to be made, confessions to be heard, strangers to be\r\nentertained, _veniae_ to be granted or refused; and I warrant me, when\r\nevery one of you was asleep in your cell, the Abbot hath lain awake for\r\na full hour by the bell, thinking how these matters might be ordered\r\nseemly and suitably."\r\n\r\n"May we ask, reverend my lord," said the Sub-Prior, "what additional\r\ncare has now been thrown upon you, since your discourse seems to point\r\nthat way?"\r\n\r\n"Marry, this it is," said the Abbot. "The talk is not now of _biberes_,\r\n\r\n[Footnote: The _biberes, caritas_, and boiled almonds, of which Abbot\r\nBoniface speaks, were special occasions for enjoying luxuries, afforded\r\nto the monks by grants from different sovereigns, or from other\r\nbenefactors to the convent. There is one of these charters called _De\r\nPitancia Centum Librarum_ By this charter, which is very curious, our\r\nRobert Bruce, on the 10th January, and in the twelfth year of his reign,\r\nassigns, out of the customs of Berwick, and failing them, out of the\r\ncustoms of Edinburgh or Haddington, the sum of one hundred pounds, at\r\nthe half-yearly terms of Pentecost and Saint Martin\'s in winter, to the\r\nabbot and community of the monks of Melrose. The precise purpose of this\r\nannuity is to furnish to each of the monks of the said monastery, while\r\nplaced at food in the refectory, an extra mess of rice boiled with\r\nmilk, or of almonds, or peas, or other pulse of that kind which could\r\nbe procured in the country. This addition to their commons is to be\r\nentitled the King\'s Mess. And it is declared, that although any monk\r\nshould, from some honest apology, want appetite or inclination to eat of\r\nthe king\'s mess, his share should, nevertheless, be placed on the table\r\nwith those of his brethren, and afterwards carried to the gate and\r\ngiven to the poor. "Neither is it our pleasure," continues the bountiful\r\nsovereign, "that the dinner, which is or ought to be served up to the\r\nsaid monks according to their ancient rule, should be diminished in\r\nquantity, or rendered inferior in quality, on account of this our mess,\r\nso furnished as aforesaid." It is, moreover, provided, that the abbot,\r\nwith the consent of the most sage of his brethren, shall name a prudent\r\nand decent monk for receiving, directing, and expending, all matters\r\nconcerning this annuity for the benefit of the community, agreeably to\r\nthe royal desire and intention, rendering a faithful account thereof\r\nto the abbot and superiors of the same convent. And the same charter\r\ndeclares the king\'s farther pleasure, that the said men of religion\r\nshould be bound yearly and for ever, in acknowledgment of the above\r\ndonation, to clothe fifteen poor men at the feast of Saint Martin in\r\nwinter, and to feed them on the same day, delivering to each of them\r\nfour ells of large or broad, or six ells of narrow cloth, and to each\r\nalso a new pair of shoes or sandals, according to their order; and if\r\nthe said monks shall fail in their engagements or any of them, it is the\r\nking\'s will that the fault shall be redeemed by a double performance of\r\nwhat has been omitted, to be executed at the sight of the chief forester\r\nof Ettrick for the time being, and before the return of Saint Martin\'s\r\nday succeeding that on which the omission has taken place.\r\n\r\nOf this charter, respecting the pittance of 100_l_ assigned to furnish\r\nthe monks of Melrose with a daily mess of boiled rice, almonds, or other\r\npulse, to mend their commons, the antiquarian reader will be pleased,\r\ndoubtless, to see the original.\r\n\r\nCARTA REGIS ROBERTI I.

The Abbot seemed bowed down with the extremity of sorrowful\r\napprehension, but kept his eye timorously fixed on the Sub-Prior, as if\r\nstriving to catch some comfort from the expression of his countenance.\r\nWhen at length he beheld that, after a second intent perusal of the\r\nletters, he remained still silent and full of thought, he asked him in\r\nan anxious tone, "What is to be done?"\r\n\r\n"Our duty must be done," answered the Sub-Prior, "and the rest is in the\r\nhands of God."\r\n\r\n"Our duty--our duty?" answered the Abbot, impatiently; "doubtless we are\r\nto do our duty; but what is that duty? or how will it serve us?--Will\r\nbell, book, and candle, drive back the English heretics? or will Murray\r\ncare for psalms and antiphonars? or can I fight for the Halidome, like\r\nJudas Maccabeus, against those profane Nicanors? or send the Sacristan\r\nagainst this new Holofernes, to bring back his head in a basket?"\r\n\r\n"True, my Lord Abbot," said the Sub-Prior, "we cannot fight with carnal\r\nweapons, it is alike contrary to our habit and vow; but we can die for\r\nour Convent and for our Order. Besides, we can arm those who will and\r\ncan fight. The English are but few in number, trusting, as it would\r\nseem, that they will be joined by Murray, whose march has been\r\ninterrupted. If Foster, with his Cumberland and Hexham bandits, ventures\r\nto march into Scotland, to pillage and despoil our House, we will levy\r\nour vassals, and, I trust, shall be found strong enough to give him\r\nbattle."\r\n\r\n"In the blessed name of Our Lady," said the Abbot, "think you that I am\r\nPetrus Eremita, to go forth the leader of an host?"\r\n\r\n"Nay," said the Sub-Prior, "let some man skilled in war lead our\r\npeople--there is Julian Avenel, an approved soldier."\r\n\r\n"But a scoffer, a debauched person, and, in brief, a man of Belial,"\r\nquoth the Abbot.\r\n\r\n"Still," said the monk, "we must use his ministry in that to which he\r\nhas been brought up. We can guerdon him richly, and indeed I already\r\nknow the price of his service. The English, it is expected, will\r\npresently set forth, hoping here to seize upon Piercie Shafton, whose\r\nrefuge being taken with us, they make the pretext of this unheard-of\r\ninroad."\r\n\r\n"Is it even so?" said the Abbot; "I never judged that his body of satin\r\nand his brain of feathers boded us much good."\r\n\r\n"Yet we must have his assistance, if possible," said the Sub-Prior; "he\r\nmay interest in our behalf the great Piercie, of whose friendship he\r\nboasts, and that good and faithful Lord may break Foster\'s purpose. I\r\nwill despatch the jackman after him with all speed.--Chiefly, however, I\r\ntrust to the military spirit of the land, which will not suffer peace to\r\nbe easily broken on the frontier. Credit me, my lord, it will bring\r\nto our side the hands of many, whose hearts may have gone astray after\r\nstrange doctrines. The great chiefs and barons will be ashamed to let\r\nthe vassals of peaceful monks fight unaided against the old enemies of\r\nScotland."\r\n\r\n"It may be," said the Abbot, "that Foster will wait for Murray, whose\r\npurpose hitherward is but delayed for a short space."\r\n\r\n"By the rood, he will not," said the Sub-Prior; "we know this Sir John\r\nFoster--a pestilent heretic, he will long to destroy the church--born a\r\nBorderer, he will thirst to plunder her of her wealth--a Border-warden,\r\nhe will be eager to ride in Scotland. There are too many causes to urge\r\nhim on. If he joins with Murray, he will have at best but an auxiliary\'s\r\nshare of the spoil--if he comes hither before him, he will reckon on the\r\nwhole harvest of depredation as his own. Julian Avenel also has, as I\r\nhave heard, some spite against Sir John Foster; they will fight,\r\nwhen they meet, with double determination.--Sacristan, send for our\r\nbailiff.--Where is the roll of fencible men liable to do suit and\r\nservice to the Halidome?--Send off to the Baron of Meigallot; he\r\ncan raise threescore horse and better--Say to him the Monastery will\r\ncompound with him for the customs of his bridge, which have been in\r\ncontroversy, if he will show himself a friend at such a point.--And now,\r\nmy lord, let us compute our possible numbers, and those of the enemy,\r\nthat human blood be not spilled in vain--Let us therefore calculate----"\r\n\r\n"My brain is dizzied with the emergency," said the poor Abbot--"I am\r\nnot, I think, more a coward than others, so far as my own person is\r\nconcerned; but speak to me of marching and collecting soldiers, and\r\ncalculating forces, and you may as well tell of it to the youngest\r\nnovice of a nunnery. But my resolution is taken.--Brethren," he said,\r\nrising up, and coming forward with that dignity which his comely person\r\nenabled him to assume, "hear for the last time the voice of your Abbot\r\nBoniface. I have done for you the best that I could; in quieter times\r\nI had perhaps done better, for it was for quiet that I sought the\r\ncloister, which has been to me a place of turmoil, as much as if I had\r\nsate in the receipt of custom, or ridden forth as leader of an armed\r\nhost. But now matters turn worse and worse, and I, as I grow old, am\r\nless able to struggle with them. Also, it becomes me not to hold a\r\nplace, whereof the duties, through my default or misfortune, may be but\r\nimperfectly filled by me. Wherefore I have resolved to demit this mine\r\nhigh office, so that the order of these matters may presently devolve\r\nupon Father Eustatius here present, our well-beloved Sub-Prior; and\r\nI now rejoice that he hath not been provided according to his merits\r\nelsewhere, seeing that I well hope he will succeed to the mitre and\r\nstaff which it is my present purpose to lay down."\r\n\r\n"In the name of Our Lady, do nothing hastily, my lord!" said Father\r\nNicholas--"I do remember that when the worthy Abbot Ingelram, being in\r\nhis ninetieth year--for I warrant you he could remember when Benedict\r\nthe Thirteenth was deposed--and being ill at ease and bed-rid, the\r\nbrethren rounded in his ear that he were better resign his office. And\r\nwhat said he, being a pleasant man? marry, that while he could crook his\r\nlittle finger he would keep hold of the crosier with it."\r\n\r\nThe Sacristan also strongly remonstrated against the resolution of\r\nhis Superior, and set down the insufficiency he pleaded to the native\r\nmodesty of his disposition. The Abbot listened in downcast silence; even\r\nflattery could not win his ear.\r\n\r\nFather Eustace took a nobler tone with his disconcerted and dejected\r\nSuperior. "My Lord Abbot," he said, "if I have been silent concerning\r\nthe virtues with which you have governed this house, do not think that I\r\nam unaware of them. I know that no man ever brought to your high office\r\na more sincere wish to do well to all mankind; and if your rule has\r\nnot been marked with the bold lines which sometimes distinguished your\r\nspiritual predecessors, their faults have equally been strangers to your\r\ncharacter."\r\n\r\n"I did not believe," said the Abbot, turning his looks to Father Eustace\r\nwith some surprise, "that you, father, of all men, would have done me\r\nthis justice."\r\n\r\n"In your absence," said the Sub-Prior, "I have even done it more\r\nfully. Do not lose the good opinion which all men entertain of you, by\r\nrenouncing your office when your care is most needed."\r\n\r\n"But, my brother," said the Abbot, "I leave a more able in my place."\r\n\r\n"That you do not," said Eustace; "because it is not necessary you should\r\nresign, in order to possess the use of whatever experience or talent I\r\nmay be accounted master of. I have been long enough in this profession\r\nto know that the individual qualities which any of us may have, are not\r\nhis own, but the property of the Community, and only so far useful when\r\nthey promote the general advantage. If you care not in person, my lord,\r\nto deal with this troublesome matter, let me implore you to go instantly\r\nto Edinburgh, and make what friends you can in our behalf, while I in\r\nyour absence will, as Sub-Prior, do my duty in defence of the Halidome.\r\nIf I succeed, may the honour and praise be yours, and if I fail, let the\r\ndisgrace and shame be mine own."\r\n\r\nThe Abbot mused for a space, and then replied,--"No, Father Eustatius,\r\nyou shall not conquer me by your generosity. In times like these, this\r\nhouse must have a stronger pilotage than my weak hands afford; and he\r\nwho steers the vessel must be chief of the crew. Shame were it to accept\r\nthe praise of other men\'s labours; and, in my poor mind, all the praise\r\nwhich can be bestowed on him who undertakes a task so perilous and\r\nperplexing, is a meed beneath his merits. Misfortune to him would\r\ndeprive him of an iota of it! Assume, therefore, your authority\r\nto-night, and proceed in the preparations you judge necessary. Let the\r\nChapter be summoned to-morrow after we have heard mass, and all shall be\r\nordered as I have told you. Benedicite, my brethren!--peace be with you!\r\nMay the new Abbot-expectant sleep as sound as he who is about to resign\r\nhis mitre."\r\n\r\nThey retired, affected even to tears. The good Abbot had shown a point\r\nof his character to which they were strangers. Even Father Eustace\r\nhad held his spiritual Superior hitherto as a good-humoured, indolent,\r\nself-indulgent man, whose chief merit was the absence of gross faults;\r\nso that this sacrifice of power to a sense of duty, even if a little\r\nalloyed by the meaner motives of fear and apprehended difficulties,\r\nraised him considerably in the Sub-Prior\'s estimation. He even felt an\r\naversion to profit by the resignation of the Abbot Boniface, and in a\r\nmanner to rise on his ruins; but this sentiment did not long contend\r\nwith those which led him to recollect higher considerations. It could\r\nnot be denied that Boniface was entirely unfit for his situation in the\r\npresent crisis; and the Sub-Prior felt that he himself, acting merely\r\nas a delegate, could not well take the decisive measures which the time\r\nrequired; the weal of the Community therefore demanded his elevation.\r\nIf, besides, there crept in a feeling of a high dignity obtained, and\r\nthe native exultation of a haughty spirit called to contend with\r\nthe imminent dangers attached to a post of such distinction, these\r\nsentiments were so cunningly blended and amalgamated with others of\r\na more disinterested nature, that, as the Sub-Prior himself was\r\nunconscious of their agency, we, who have a regard for him, are not\r\nsolicitous to detect it.\r\n\r\nThe Abbot elect carried himself with more dignity than formerly, when\r\ngiving such directions as the pressing circumstances of the times\r\nrequired; and those who approached him could perceive an unusual\r\nkindling of his falcon eye, and an unusual flush upon his pale and\r\nfaded cheek. With briefness and precision he wrote and dictated various\r\nletters to different barons, acquainting them with the meditated\r\ninvasion of the Halidome by the English, and conjuring them to lend aid\r\nand assistance as in a common cause. The temptation of advantage was\r\nheld out to those whom he judged less sensible of the cause of honour,\r\nand all were urged by the motives of patriotism and ancient animosity to\r\nthe English. The time had been when no such exhortations would have been\r\nnecessary. But so essential was Elizabeth\'s aid to the reformed party\r\nin Scotland, and so strong was that party almost every where, that\r\nthere was reason to believe a great many would observe neutrality on the\r\npresent occasion, even if they did not go the length of uniting with the\r\nEnglish against the Catholics.\r\n\r\nWhen Father Eustace considered the number of the immediate vassals of\r\nthe church whose aid he might legally command, his heart sunk at the\r\nthoughts of ranking them under the banner of the fierce and profligate\r\nJulian Avenel.\r\n\r\n"Were the young enthusiast Halbert Glendinning to be found," thought\r\nFather Eustace in his anxiety, "I would have risked the battle under his\r\nleading, young as he is, and with better hope of God\'s blessing. But the\r\nbailiff is now too infirm, nor know I a chief of name whom I might trust\r\nin this important matter better than this Avenel."--He touched a bell\r\nwhich stood on the table, and commanded Christie of the Clinthill to be\r\nbrought before him.--"Thou owest me a life," said he to that person on\r\nhis entrance, "and I may do thee another good turn if thou be\'st sincere\r\nwith me."\r\n\r\nChristie had already drained two standing-cups of wine, which would, on\r\nanother occasion, have added to the insolence of his familiarity. But at\r\npresent there was something in the augmented dignity of manner of Father\r\nEustace, which imposed a restraint on him. Yet his answers partook of\r\nhis usual character of undaunted assurance. He professed himself willing\r\nto return a true answer to all inquiries.\r\n\r\n"Has the Baron (so styled) of Avenel any friendship with Sir John\r\nFoster, Warden of the West Marches of England?"\r\n\r\n"Such friendship as is between the wild-cat and the terrier," replied\r\nthe rider.\r\n\r\n"Will he do battle with him should they meet?"\r\n\r\n"As surely," answered Christie, "as ever cock fought on\r\nShrovetide-even."\r\n\r\n"And would he fight with Foster in the Church\'s quarrel?"\r\n\r\n"On any quarrel, or upon no quarrel whatever," replied the jackman.\r\n\r\n"We will then write to him, letting him know, that if upon occasion of\r\nan apprehended incursion by Sir John Foster, he will join his force with\r\nours, he shall lead our men, and be gratified for doing so to the extent\r\nof his wish.--Yet one word more--Thou didst say thou couldst find out\r\nwhere the English knight Piercie Shafton has this day fled to?"\r\n\r\n"That I can, and bring him back too, by fair means or force, as best\r\nlikes your reverence."\r\n\r\n"No force must be used upon him. Within what time wilt thou find him\r\nout?"\r\n\r\n"Within thirty hours, so he have not crossed the Lothian firth--If it\r\nis to do you a pleasure, I will set off directly, and wind him as a\r\nsleuth-dog tracks the moss-trooper," answered Christie.\r\n\r\n"Bring him hither then, and thou wilt deserve good at our hands, which I\r\nmay soon have free means of bestowing on thee."\r\n\r\n"Thanks to your reverence, I put myself in your reverence\'s hands. We of\r\nthe spear and snaffle walk something recklessly through life; but if a\r\nman were worse than he is, your reverence knows he must live, and that\'s\r\nnot to be done without shifting, I trow."\r\n\r\n"Peace, sir, and begone on thine errand--thou shalt have a letter from\r\nus to Sir Piercie."\r\n\r\nChristie made two steps towards the door; then turning back and\r\nhesitating, like one who would make an impertinent pleasantry if he\r\ndared, he asked what he was to do with the wench Mysie Happer whom the\r\nSouthron knight had carried off with him.\r\n\r\n"Am I to bring her hither, please your reverence?"\r\n\r\n"Hither, you malapert knave?" said the churchman; "remember you to whom\r\nyou speak?"\r\n\r\n"No offence meant," replied Christie; "but if such is not your will, I\r\nwould carry her to Avenel Castle, where a well-favoured wench was never\r\nunwelcome.\r\n\r\n"Bring the unfortunate girl to her father\'s and break no scurril jests\r\nhere," said the Sub-Prior--"See that thou guide her in all safety and\r\nhonour."\r\n\r\n"In safety, surely," said the rider, "and in such honour as her outbreak\r\nhas left her.--I bid your reverence farewell, I must be on horse before\r\ncock-crow."\r\n\r\n"What, in the dark!--how knowest thou which way to go?"\r\n\r\n"I tracked the knight\'s horse-tread as far as near to the ford, as we\r\nrode along together," said Christie, "and I observed the track turn\r\nto the north-ward. He is for Edinburgh, I will warrant you--so soon\r\nas daylight comes I will be on the road again. It is a kenspeckle\r\nhoof-mark, for the shoe was made by old Eckie of Cannobie--I would swear\r\nto the curve of the caulker." So saying, he departed.\r\n\r\n"Hateful necessity," said Father Eustace, looking after him, "that\r\nobliges us to use such implements as these! But assailed as we are\r\non all sides, and by all conditions of men, what alternative is left\r\nus?--But now let me to my most needful task."\r\n\r\nThe Abbot elect accordingly sate down to write letters, arrange orders,\r\nand take upon him the whole charge of an institution which tottered to\r\nits fall, with the same spirit of proud and devoted fortitude wherewith\r\nthe commander of a fortress, reduced nearly to the last extremity,\r\ncalculates what means remain to him to protract the fatal hour of\r\nsuccessful storm. In the meanwhile Abbot Boniface, having given a few\r\nnatural sighs to the downfall of the pre-eminence he had so long enjoyed\r\namongst his brethren, fell fast asleep, leaving the whole cares and\r\ntoils of office to his assistant and [Chapter ending is missing in the\r\noriginal]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter the Thirty-Fifth.\r\n\r\n\r\n  And when he came to broken briggs,\r\n    He slacked his bow and swam;\r\n  And when he came to grass growing,\r\n    Set down his feet and ran.\r\n                         GIL MORRICE.\r\n\r\nWe return to Halbert Glendinning, who, as our readers may remember, took\r\nthe high road to Edinburgh. His intercourse with the preacher, Henry\r\nWarden, from whom he received a letter at the moment of his deliverance,\r\nhad been so brief, that he had not even learned the name of the nobleman\r\nto whose care he was recommended. Something like a name had been spoken\r\nindeed, but he had only comprehended that he was to meet the chief\r\nadvancing towards the south, at the head of a party of horse. When day\r\ndawned on his journey he was in the same uncertainty. A better scholar\r\nwould have been informed by the address of the letter, but Halbert\r\nhad not so far profited by Father Eustace\'s lessons as to be able\r\nto decipher it. His mother-wit taught him that he must not, in such\r\nuncertain times, be too hasty in asking information of any one; and\r\nwhen, after a long day\'s journey, night surprised him near a little\r\nvillage, he began to be dubious and anxious concerning the issue of his\r\njourney.\r\n\r\nIn a poor country, hospitality is generally exercised freely, and\r\nHalbert, when he requested a night\'s quarters, did nothing either\r\ndegrading or extraordinary. The old woman, to whom he made this request,\r\ngranted it the more readily, that she thought she saw some resemblance\r\nbetween Halbert and her son Saunders, who had been killed in one of\r\nthe frays so common in the time. It is true, Saunders was a short\r\nsquare-made fellow, with red hair and a freckled face, and somewhat\r\nbandy-legged, whereas the stranger was of a brown complexion, tall,\r\nand remarkably well-made. Nevertheless, the widow was clear that there\r\nexisted a general resemblance betwixt her guest and Saunders, and kindly\r\npressed him to share of her evening cheer. A pedlar, a man of about\r\nforty years old, was also her guest, who talked with great feeling of\r\nthe misery of pursuing such a profession as his in the time of war and\r\ntumult.\r\n\r\n"We think much of knights and soldiers," said he; "but the pedder-coffe\r\nwho travels the land has need of more courage than them all. I am sure\r\nhe maun face mair risk, God help him. Here have I come this length,\r\ntrusting the godly Earl of Murray would be on his march to the Borders,\r\nfor he was to have guestened with the Baron of Avenel; and instead of\r\nthat comes news that he has gone westlandways about some tuilzie in\r\nAyrshire. And what to do I wot not; for if I go to the south without a\r\nsafeguard, the next bonny rider I meet might ease me of sack and pack,\r\nand maybe of my life to boot; and then, if I try to strike across the\r\nmoors, I may be as ill off before I can join myself to that good Lord\'s\r\ncompany."\r\n\r\nNo one was quicker at catching a hint than Halbert Glendinning. He said\r\nhe himself had a desire to go westward. The pedlar looked at him with\r\na very doubtful air, when the old dame, who perhaps thought her young\r\nguest resembled the umquhile Saunders, not only in his looks, but in a\r\ncertain pretty turn to sleight-of-hand, which the defunct was supposed\r\nto have possessed, tipped him the wink, and assured the pedlar he need\r\nhave no doubt that her young cousin was a true man.\r\n\r\n"Cousin!" said the pedlar, "I thought you said this youth had been a\r\nstranger."\r\n\r\n"Ill hearing makes ill rehearsing," said the landlady; "he is a stranger\r\nto me by eye-sight, but that does not make him a stranger to me by\r\nblood, more especially seeing his likeness to my son Saunders, poor\r\nbairn."\r\n\r\nThe pedlar\'s scruples and jealousies being thus removed, or at least\r\nsilenced, the travellers agreed that they would proceed in company\r\ntogether the next morning by daybreak, the pedlar acting as a guide to\r\nGlendinning, and the youth as a guard to the pedlar, until they should\r\nfall in with Murray\'s detachment of horse. It would appear that the\r\nlady never doubted what was to be the event of this compact, for, taking\r\nGlendinning aside, she charged him, "to be moderate with the puir body,\r\nbut at all events, not to forget to take a piece of black say, to make\r\nthe auld wife a new rokelay." Halbert laughed and took his leave.\r\n\r\nIt did not a little appal the pedlar, when, in the midst of a black\r\nheath, the young man told him the nature of the commission with which\r\ntheir hostess had charged him. He took heart, however, upon seeing\r\nthe open, frank, and friendly demeanor of the youth, and vented his\r\nexclamations on the ungrateful old traitress. "I gave her," he said,\r\n"yesterday-e\'en nae farther gane, a yard of that very black say, to make\r\nher a couvre-chef; but I see it is ill done to teach the cat the way to\r\nthe kirn."\r\n\r\nThus set at ease on the intentions of his companion (for in those happy\r\ndays the worst was always to be expected from a stranger), the pedlar\r\nacted as Halbert\'s guide over moss and moor, over hill and many a\r\ndale, in such a direction as might best lead them towards the route of\r\nMurray\'s party. At length they arrived upon the side of an eminence,\r\nwhich commanded a distant prospect over a tract of savage and desolate\r\nmoorland, marshy and waste--an alternate change of shingly hill and\r\nlevel morass, only varied by blue stagnant pools of water. A road\r\nscarcely marked winded like a serpent through the wilderness, and the\r\npedlar, pointing to it, said--"The road from Edinburgh to Glasgow. Here\r\nwe must wait, and if Murray and his train be not already passed by, we\r\nshall soon see trace of them, unless some new purpose shall have altered\r\ntheir resolution; for in these blessed days no man, were he the nearest\r\nthe throne, as the Earl of Murray may be, knows when he lays his head on\r\nhis pillow at night where it is to lie upon the following even."\r\n\r\nThey paused accordingly and sat down, the pedlar cautiously using for a\r\nseat the box which contained his treasures, and not concealing from his\r\ncompanion that he wore under his cloak a pistolet hanging at his belt in\r\ncase of need. He was courteous, however, and offered Halbert a share of\r\nthe provisions which he carried about him for refreshment. They were of\r\nthe coarsest kind--oat-bread baked in cakes, oatmeal slaked with cold\r\nwater, an onion or two, and a morsel of smoked ham completed the feast.\r\nBut such as it was, no Scotsman of the time, had his rank been much\r\nhigher than that of Glendinning, would have refused to share in it,\r\nespecially as the pedlar produced, with a mysterious air, a tup\'s horn,\r\nwhich he carried slung from his shoulders, and which, when its contents\r\nwere examined, produced to each party a clam-shell-full of excellent\r\nusquebaugh--a liquor strange to Halbert, for the strong waters known in\r\nthe south of Scotland came from France, and in fact such were but rarely\r\nused. The pedlar recommended it as excellent, said he had procured it in\r\nhis last visit to the braes of Doune, where he had securely traded under\r\nthe safe-conduct of the Laird of Buchanan. He also set an example\r\nto Halbert, by devoutly emptying the cup "to the speedy downfall of\r\nAnti-Christ."\r\n\r\nTheir conviviality was scarce ended, ere a rising dust was seen on the\r\nroad of which they commanded the prospect, and half a score of horsemen\r\nwere dimly descried advancing at considerable speed, their casques\r\nglancing, and the points of their spears twinkling as they caught a\r\nglimpse of the sun.\r\n\r\n"These," said the pedlar, "must be the out-scourers of Murray\'s party;\r\nlet us lie down in the peat-hag, and keep ourselves out of sight."\r\n\r\n"And why so?" said Halbert; "let us rather go down and make a signal to\r\nthem."\r\n\r\n"God forbid!" replied the pedlar; "do you ken so ill the customs of our\r\nScottish nation? That plump of spears that are spurring on so fast are\r\ndoubtless commanded by some wild kinsman of Morton, or some such daring\r\nfear-nothing as neither regards God nor man. It is their business, if\r\nthey meet with any enemies, to pick quarrels and clear the way of them;\r\nand the chief knows nothing of what happens, coming up with his more\r\ndiscreet and moderate friends, it may be a full mile in the rear. Were\r\nwe to go near these lads of the laird\'s belt, your letter would do you\r\nlittle good, and my pack would do me muckle black ill; they would tirl\r\nevery steek of claithes from our back, fling us into a moss-hag with a\r\nstone at our heels, naked as the hour that brought us into this cumbered\r\nand sinful world, and neither Murray nor any other man ever the wiser.\r\nBut if he did come to ken of it, what might he help it?--it would be\r\naccounted a mere mistake, and there were all the moan made. O credit\r\nme, youth, that when men draw cold steel on each other in their native\r\ncountry, they neither can nor may dwell deeply on the offences of those\r\nwhose swords are useful to them."\r\n\r\nThey suffered, therefore, the vanguard, as it might be termed, of the\r\nEarl of Murray\'s host to pass forward; and it was not long until a\r\ndenser cloud of dust began to arise to the northward.\r\n\r\n"Now," said the pedlar, "let us hurry down the hill; for to tell the\r\ntruth," said he, dragging Halbert along earnestly, "a Scottish noble\'s\r\nmarch is like a serpent--the head is furnished with fangs, and the tail\r\nhath its sting; the only harmless point of access is the main body."\r\n\r\n"I will hasten as fast as you," said the youth; "but tell me why the\r\nrearward of such an army should be as dangerous as the van?"\r\n\r\n"Because, as the vanguard consists of their picked wild desperates,\r\nresolute for mischief, such as neither fear God nor regard their\r\nfellow-creatures, but understand themselves bound to hurry from the road\r\nwhatever is displeasing to themselves, so the rear-guard consists of\r\nmisproud serving-men, who, being in charge of the baggage, take care to\r\namend by their exactions upon travelling-merchants and others, their own\r\nthefts on their master\'s property. You will hear the advanced _enfans\r\nperdus_, as the French call them, and so they are indeed, namely,\r\nchildren of the fall, singing unclean and fulsome ballads of sin and\r\nharlotrie. And then will come on the middle-ward, when you will hear the\r\ncanticles and psalms sung by the reforming nobles, and the gentry, and\r\nhonest and pious clergy, by whom they are accompanied. And last of all,\r\nyou will find in the rear a legend of godless lackies, palfreniers, and\r\nhorse-boys, talking of nothing but dicing, drinking, and drabbing."\r\n\r\nAs the pedlar spoke, they had reached the side of the high-road, and\r\nMurray\'s main body was in sight, consisting of about three hundred\r\nhorse, marching with great regularity, and in a closely compacted body.\r\nSome of the troopers wore the liveries of their masters, but this\r\nwas not common. Most of them were dressed in such colours as chance\r\ndictated. But the majority, being clad in blue cloth, and the whole\r\narmed with cuirass and back-plate, with sleeves of mail, gauntlets,\r\nand poldroons, and either mailed hose or strong jack-boots, they had\r\nsomething of a uniform appearance.\r\n\r\nMany of the leaders were clad in complete armour, and all in a certain\r\nhalf-military dress, which no man of quality in those disturbed times\r\never felt himself sufficiently safe to abandon.\r\n\r\nThe foremost of this party immediately rode up to the pedlar and to\r\nHalbert Glendinning, and demanded of them who they were. The pedlar told\r\nhis story, the young Glendinning exhibited his letter, which a gentleman\r\ncarried to Murray. In an instant after, the word "Halt!" was given\r\nthrough the squadron, and at once the onward heavy tramp, which seemed\r\nthe most distinctive attribute of the body, ceased, and was heard no\r\nmore. The command was announced that the troop should halt here for an\r\nhour to refresh themselves and their horses. The pedlar was assured of\r\nsafe protection, and accommodated with the use of a baggage horse.\r\nBut at the same time he was ordered into the rear; a command which he\r\nreluctantly obeyed, and not without wringing pathetically the hand of\r\nHalbert as he separated from him.\r\n\r\nThe young heir of Glendearg was in the meanwhile conducted to a plot of\r\nground more raised, and therefore drier than the rest of the moor. Here\r\na carpet was flung on the ground by way of table-cloth, and around it\r\nsat the leaders of the party, partaking of an entertainment as coarse,\r\nwith relation to their rank, as that which Glendinning had so lately\r\nshared. Murray himself rose as he came forward, and advanced a step to\r\nmeet him.\r\n\r\nThis celebrated person had in his appearance, as well as in his mind,\r\nmuch of the admirable qualities of James V. his father. Had not the\r\nstain of illegitimacy rested upon his birth, he would have filled the\r\nScottish throne with as much honour as any of the Stewart race. But\r\nHistory, while she acknowledges his high talents, and much that was\r\nprincely, nay, royal, in his conduct, cannot forget that ambition led\r\nhim farther than honour or loyalty warranted. Brave amongst the bravest,\r\nfair in presence and in favour, skilful to manage the most intricate\r\naffairs, to attach to himself those who were doubtful, to stun and\r\noverwhelm, by the suddenness and intrepidity of his enterprises, those\r\nwho were resolute in resistance, he attained, and as to personal merit\r\ncertainly deserved, the highest place in the kingdom. But he abused,\r\nunder the influence of strong temptation, the opportunities which his\r\nsister Mary\'s misfortunes and imprudence threw in his way; he supplanted\r\nhis sovereign and benefactress in her power, and his history affords\r\nus one of those mixed characters, in which principle was so often\r\nsacrificed to policy, that we must condemn the statesman while we pity\r\nand regret the individual. Many events in his life gave likelihood to\r\nthe charge that he himself aimed at the crown; and it is too true, that\r\nhe countenanced the fatal expedient of establishing an English, that is\r\na foreign and a hostile interest, in the councils of Scotland. But his\r\ndeath may be received as an atonement for his offences, and may serve\r\nto show how much more safe is the person of a real patriot, than that of\r\nthe mere head of a faction, who is accounted answerable for the offences\r\nof his meanest attendants.\r\n\r\nWhen Murray approached, the young rustic was naturally abashed at the\r\ndignity of his presence. The commanding form and the countenance to\r\nwhich high and important thoughts were familiar, the features which bore\r\nthe resemblance of Scotland\'s long line of kings, were well calculated\r\nto impress awe and reverence. His dress had little to distinguish\r\nhim from the high-born nobles and barons by whom he was attended. A\r\nbuff-coat, richly embroidered with silken lace, supplied the place of\r\narmour; and a massive gold chain, with its medal, hung round his neck.\r\nHis black velvet bonnet was decorated with a string of large and fair\r\npearls, and with a small tufted feather; a long heavy sword was girt to\r\nhis side, as the familiar companion of his hand. He wore gilded spurs on\r\nhis boots, and these completed his equipment.\r\n\r\n"This letter," he said, "is from the godly preacher of the word, Henry\r\nWarden, young man? is it not so?" Halbert answered in the affirmative.\r\n"And he writes to us, it would seem, in some strait, and refers us to\r\nyou for the circumstances. Let us know, I pray you, how things stand\r\nwith him."\r\n\r\nIn some perturbation Halbert Glendinning gave an account of the\r\ncircumstances which had accompanied the preacher\'s imprisonment. When\r\nhe came to the discussion of the _handfasting_ engagement, he was struck\r\nwith the ominous and displeased expression of Murray\'s brows, and,\r\ncontrary to all prudential and politic rule, seeing something was wrong,\r\nyet not well aware what that something was, had almost stopped short in\r\nhis narrative.\r\n\r\n"What ails the fool?" said the Earl, drawing his dark-red eyebrows\r\ntogether, while the same dusky glow kindled on his brow--"Hast thou not\r\nlearned to tell a true tale without stammering?"\r\n\r\n"So please you," answered Halbert, with considerable address, "I have\r\nnever before spoken in such a presence."\r\n\r\n"He seems a modest youth," said Murray, turning to his next attendant,\r\n"and yet one who in a good cause will neither fear friend nor\r\nfoe.--Speak on, friend, and speak freely."\r\n\r\nHalbert then gave an account of the quarrel betwixt Julian Avenel\r\nand the preacher, which the Earl, biting his lip the while, compelled\r\nhimself to listen to as a thing of indifference. At first he appeared\r\neven to take the part of the Baron.\r\n\r\n"Henry Warden," he said, "is too hot in his zeal. The law both of God\r\nand man maketh allowance for certain alliances, though not strictly\r\nformal, and the issue of such may succeed."\r\n\r\nThis general declaration he expressed, accompanying it with a glance\r\naround upon the few followers who were present at this interview. The\r\nmost of them answered--"There is no contravening that;" but one or\r\ntwo looked on the ground, and were silent. Murray then turned again to\r\nGlendinning, commanding him to say what next chanced, and not to omit\r\nany particular. When he mentioned the manner in which Julian had cast\r\nfrom him his concubine, Murray drew a deep breath, set his teeth hard,\r\nand laid his hand on the hilt of his dagger. Casting his eyes once more\r\naround the circle, which was now augmented by one or two of the reformed\r\npreachers, he seemed to devour his rage in silence, and again commanded\r\nHalbert to proceed. When he came to describe how Warden had been dragged\r\nto a dungeon, the Earl seemed to have found the point at which he might\r\ngive vent to his own resentment, secure of the sympathy and approbation\r\nof all who were present. "Judge you," he said, looking to those around\r\nhim, "judge you, my peers, and noble gentlemen of Scotland, betwixt me\r\nand this Julian Avenel--he hath broken his own word, and hath violated\r\nmy safe-conduct--and judge you also, my reverend brethren, he hath put\r\nhis hand forth upon a preacher of the gospel, and perchance may sell his\r\nblood to the worshippers of Anti-Christ!"\r\n\r\n"Let him die the death of a traitor," said the secular chiefs, "and let\r\nhis tongue be struck through with the hangman\'s fiery iron to avenge his\r\nperjury!"\r\n\r\n"Let him go down to his place with Baal\'s priests," said the preachers,\r\n"and be his ashes cast into Tophet!"\r\n\r\nMurray heard them with the smile of expected revenge; yet it is probable\r\nthat the brutal treatment of the female, whose circumstances somewhat\r\nresembled those of the Earl\'s own mother, had its share in the grim\r\nsmile which curled his sun-burnt cheek and its haughty lip. To Halbert\r\nGlendinning, when his narrative was finished, he spoke with great\r\nkindness.\r\n\r\n"He is a bold and gallant youth," said he to those around, "and formed\r\nof the stuff which becomes a bustling time. There are periods when men\'s\r\nspirits shine bravely through them. I will know something more of him."\r\n\r\nHe questioned him more particularly concerning the Baron of Avenel\'s\r\nprobable forces--the strength of his castle--the dispositions of his\r\nnext heir, and this brought necessarily forward the sad history of his\r\nbrother\'s daughter, Mary Avenel, which was told with an embarrassment\r\nthat did not escape Murray.\r\n\r\n"Ha! Julian Avenel," he said, "and do you provoke my resentment, when\r\nyou have so much more reason to deprecate my justice! I knew Walter\r\nAvenel, a true Scotsman and a good soldier. Our sister, the Queen, must\r\nright his daughter; and were her land restored, she would be a fitting\r\nbride to some brave man who may better merit our favour than the traitor\r\nJulian."--Then looking at Halbert, he said, "Art thou of gentle blood,\r\nyoung man?"\r\n\r\nHalbert, with a faltering and uncertain voice, began to speak of his\r\ndistant pretensions to claim a descent from the ancient Glendonwynes of\r\nGalloway, when Murray interrupted him with a smile.\r\n\r\n"Nay--nay--leave pedigrees to bards and heralds. In our days, each,\r\nman is the son of his own deeds. The glorious light of reformation hath\r\nshone alike on prince and peasant; and peasant as well as prince may be\r\nillustrated by fighting in its defence. It is a stirring world, where\r\nall may advance themselves who have stout hearts and strong arms. Tell\r\nme frankly why thou hast left thy father\'s house."\r\n\r\nHalbert Glendinning made a frank confession of his duel with Piercie\r\nShafton, and mentioned his supposed death.\r\n\r\n"By my hand," said Murray, "thou art a bold sparrow-hawk, to match thee\r\nso early with such a kite as Piercie Shafton. Queen Elizabeth would give\r\nher glove filled with gold crowns to know that meddling coxcomb to be\r\nunder the sod.--Would she not, Morton?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, by my word, and esteem her glove a better gift than the crowns,"\r\nreplied Morton, "which few Border lads like this fellow will esteem just\r\nvaluation."\r\n\r\n"But what shall we do with this young homicide?" said Murray; "what will\r\nour preachers say?"\r\n\r\n"Tell them of Moses and of Benaiah," said Morton; "it is but the smiting\r\nof an Egyptian when all is said out."\r\n\r\n"Let it be so," said Murray, laughing; "but we will bury the tale,\r\nas the prophet did the body, in the sand. I will take care of this\r\nswankie.--Be near to us, Glendinning, since that is thy name. We retain\r\nthee as a squire of our household. The master of our horse will see thee\r\nfully equipped and armed."\r\n\r\nDuring the expedition which he was now engaged in, Murray found several\r\nopportunities of putting Glendinning\'s courage and presence of mind to\r\nthe test, and he began to rise so rapidly in his esteem, that those who\r\nknew the Earl considered the youth\'s fortune as certain. One step only\r\nwas wanting to raise him to a still higher degree of confidence and\r\nfavour--it was the abjuration of the Popish religion. The ministers who\r\nattended upon Murray and formed his chief support amongst the people,\r\nfound an easy convert in Halbert Glendinning, who, from his earliest\r\ndays, had never felt much devotion towards the Catholic faith, and who\r\nlistened eagerly to more reasonable views of religion. By thus\r\nadopting the faith of his master, he rose higher in his favour, and was\r\nconstantly about his person during his prolonged stay in the west of\r\nScotland, which the intractability of those whom the Earl had to deal\r\nwith, protracted from day to day, and week to week.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter the Thirty-Sixth.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Faint the din of battle bray\'d\r\n    Distant down the hollow wind;\r\n  War and terror fled before,\r\n    Wounds and death were left behind.\r\n                      PENROSE.\r\n\r\nThe autumn of the year was well advanced, when the Earl of Morton, one\r\nmorning, rather unexpectedly, entered the antechamber of Murray, in\r\nwhich Halbert Glendinning was in waiting.\r\n\r\n"Call your master, Halbert," said the Earl; "I have news for him from\r\nTeviotdale; and for you too, Glendinning.--News! news! my Lord of\r\nMurray!" he exclaimed at the door of the Earl\'s bedroom; "come forth\r\ninstantly." The Earl appeared, and greeted his ally, demanding eagerly\r\nhis tidings.\r\n\r\n"I have had a sure friend with me from the south," said Morton; "he has\r\nbeen at Saint Mary\'s Monastery, and brings important tidings." "Of\r\nwhat complexion?" said Murray, "and can you trust the bearer?" "He is\r\nfaithful, on my life," said Morton; "I wish all around your Lordship may\r\nprove equally so."\r\n\r\n"At what, and whom, do you point?" demanded Murray.\r\n\r\n"Here is the Egyptian of trusty Halbert Glendinning, our Southland\r\nMoses, come alive again, and flourishing, gay and bright as ever, in\r\nthat Teviotdale Goshen, the Halidome of Kennaquhair."\r\n\r\n"What mean you, my lord?" said Murray.\r\n\r\n"Only that your new henchman has put a false tale upon you. Piercie\r\nShafton is alive and well; by the same token that the gull is thought to\r\nbe detained there by love to a miller\'s daughter, who roamed the country\r\nwith him in disguise."\r\n\r\n"Glendinning," said Murray, bending his brow into his darkest frown,\r\n"thou hast not, I trust, dared to bring me a lie in thy mouth, in order\r\nto win my confidence?"\r\n\r\n"My lord," said Halbert, "I am incapable of a lie. I should choke on one\r\nwere my life to require that I pronounced it. I say, that this sword of\r\nmy father was through the body--the point came out behind his back--the\r\nhilt pressed upon his breast-bone. And I will plunge it as deep in the\r\nbody of any one who shall dare to charge me with falsehood."\r\n\r\n"How, fellow!" said Morton, "wouldst thou beard a nobleman?"\r\n\r\n"Be silent, Halbert," said Murray, "and you, my Lord of Morton, forbear\r\nhim. I see truth written on his brow."\r\n\r\n"I wish the inside of the manuscript may correspond with the\r\nsuperscription," replied his more suspicious ally. "Look to it, my lord,\r\nyou will one day lose your life by too much confidence."\r\n\r\n"And you will lose your friends by being too readily suspicious,"\r\nanswered Murray. "Enough of this--let me hear thy tidings."\r\n\r\n"Sir John Foster," said Morton, "is about to send a party into Scotland\r\nto waste the Halidome."\r\n\r\n"How! without waiting my presence and permission?" said Murray--"he is\r\nmad--will he come as an enemy into the Queen\'s country?"\r\n\r\n"He has Elizabeth\'s express orders," answered Morton, "and they are not\r\nto be trifled with. Indeed, his march has been more than once projected\r\nand laid aside during the time we have been here, and has caused much\r\nalarm at Kennaquhair. Boniface, the old Abbot, has resigned, and whom\r\nthink you they have chosen in his place?"\r\n\r\n"No one surely," said Murray; "they would presume to hold no election\r\nuntil the Queen\'s pleasure and mine were known?"\r\n\r\nMorton shrugged his shoulders--"They have chosen the pupil of\r\nold Cardinal Beatoun, that wily determined champion of Rome, the\r\nbosom-friend of our busy Primate of Saint Andrews. Eustace, late the\r\nSub-Prior of Kennaquhair, is now its Abbot, and, like a second Pope\r\nJulius, is levying men and making musters to fight with Foster if he\r\ncomes forward."\r\n\r\n"We must prevent that meeting," said Murray, hastily; "whichever party\r\nwins the day, it were a fatal encounter for us--Who commands the troop\r\nof the Abbot?"\r\n\r\n"Our faithful old friend, Julian Avenel, nothing less," answered Morton.\r\n\r\n"Glendinning," said Murray, "sound trumpets to horse directly, and let\r\nall who love us get on horseback without delay--Yes, my lord, this were\r\nindeed a fatal dilemma. If we take part with our English friends, the\r\ncountry will cry shame on us--the very old wives will attack us with\r\ntheir rocks and spindles--the very stones of the street will rise up\r\nagainst us--we cannot set our face to such a deed of infamy. And my\r\nsister, whose confidence I already have such difficulty in preserving,\r\nwill altogether withdraw it from me. Then, were we to oppose the English\r\nWarden, Elizabeth would call it a protecting of her enemies and what\r\nnot, and we should lose her."\r\n\r\n"The she-dragon," said Morton, "is the best card in our pack; and yet\r\nI would not willingly stand still and see English blades carve Scots\r\nflesh--What say you to loitering by the way, marching far and easy for\r\nfear of spoiling our horses? They might then fight dog fight bull, fight\r\nAbbot fight archer, and no one could blame us for what chanced when we\r\nwere not present."\r\n\r\n"All would blame us, James Douglas," replied Murray; "we should lose\r\nboth sides--we had better advance with the utmost celerity, and do what\r\nwe can to keep the peace betwixt them.--I would the nag that brought\r\nPiercie Shafton hither had broken his neck over the highest heuch in\r\nNorthumberland!--He is a proper coxcomb to make all this bustle about,\r\nand to occasion perhaps a national war!"\r\n\r\n"Had we known in time," said Douglas, "we might have had him privily\r\nwaited upon as he entered the Borders; there are strapping lads enough\r\nwould have rid us of him for the lucre of his spur-whang. [Footnote:\r\n_Spur-whang_--Spur-leather.] But to the saddle, James Stewart, since so\r\nthe phrase goes. I hear your trumpets. Bound to horse and away--we shall\r\nsoon see which nag is best breathed."\r\n\r\nFollowed by a train of about three hundred well-mounted men-at-arms,\r\nthese two powerful barons directed their course to Dumfries, and from\r\nthence eastward to Teviotdale, marching at a rate which, as Morton had\r\nforetold, soon disabled a good many of their horses, so that when\r\nthey approached the scene of expected action, there were not above\r\ntwo hundred of their train remaining in a body, and of these most were\r\nmounted on steeds which had been sorely jaded.\r\n\r\nThey had hitherto been amused and agitated by various reports concerning\r\nthe advance of the English soldiers, and the degree of resistance which\r\nthe Abbot was able to oppose to them. But when they were six or seven\r\nmiles from Saint Mary\'s of Kennaquhair, a gentleman of the country, whom\r\nMurray had summoned to attend him, and on whose intelligence he knew he\r\ncould rely, arrived at the head of two or three servants, "bloody with\r\nspurring, fiery red with haste." According to his report, Sir John\r\nFoster, after several times announcing, and as often delaying, his\r\nintended incursion, had at last been so stung with the news that Piercie\r\nShafton was openly residing within the Halidome, that he determined to\r\nexecute the commands of his mistress, which directed him, at every risk,\r\nto make himself master of the Euphuist\'s person. The Abbot\'s unceasing\r\nexertions had collected a body of men almost equal in number to those of\r\nthe English Warden, but less practised in arms. They were united under\r\nthe command of Julian Avenel, and it was apprehended they would join\r\nbattle upon the banks of a small stream which forms the verge of the\r\nHalidome.\r\n\r\n"Who knows the place?" said Murray.\r\n\r\n"I do, my lord," answered Glendinning.\r\n\r\n"\'Tis well," said the Earl; "take a score of the best-mounted\r\nhorse--make what haste thou canst, and announce to them that I am coming\r\nup instantly with a strong power, and will cut to pieces, without mercy,\r\nwhichever party strikes the first blow.--Davidson," said he to the\r\ngentleman who brought the intelligence, "thou shalt be my guide.--Hie\r\nthee on, Glendinning--Say to Foster, I conjure him, as he respects his\r\nmistress\'s service, that he will leave the matter in my hands. Say to\r\nthe Abbot, I will burn the Monastery over his head, if he strikes a\r\nstroke till I come--Tell the dog, Julian Avenel, that he hath already\r\none deep score to settle with me--I will set his head on the top of the\r\nhighest pinnacle of Saint Mary\'s, if he presume to open another. Make\r\nhaste, and spare not the spur for fear of spoiling horse-flesh."\r\n\r\n"Your bidding shall be obeyed, my lord," said Glendinning; and choosing\r\nthose whose horses were in best plight to be his attendants, he went off\r\nas fast as the jaded state of their cavalry permitted. Hill and hollow\r\nvanished from under the feet of the chargers.\r\n\r\nThey had not ridden half the way, when they met stragglers coming off\r\nfrom the field, whose appearance announced that the conflict was begun.\r\nTwo supported in their arms a third, their elder brother, who was\r\npierced with an arrow through the body. Halbert, who knew them to belong\r\nto the Halidome, called them by their names, and questioned them of the\r\nstate of the affray; but just then, in spite of their efforts to retain\r\nhim in the saddle, their brother dropped from the horse, and they\r\ndismounted in haste to receive his last breath. From men thus engaged,\r\nno information was to be obtained. Glendinning, therefore, pushed\r\non with his little troop, the more anxiously, as he perceived other\r\nstragglers, bearing Saint Andrew\'s cross upon their caps and corslets,\r\nflying apparently from the field of battle. Most of these, when they\r\nwere aware of a body of horsemen approaching on the road, held to the\r\none hand or the other, at such a distance as precluded coming to speech\r\nof them. Others, whose fear was more intense, kept the onward road,\r\ngalloping wildly as fast as their horses could carry them, and when\r\nquestioned, only glared without reply on those who spoke to them, and\r\nrode on without drawing bridle. Several of these were also known to\r\nHalbert, who had therefore no doubt, from the circumstances in which\r\nhe met them, that the men of the Halidome were defeated. He became now\r\nunspeakably anxious concerning the fate of his brother, who, he could\r\nnot doubt, must have been engaged in the affray. He therefore increased\r\nthe speed of his horse, so that not above five or six of his followers\r\ncould keep up with him. At length he reached a little hill, at the\r\ndescent of which, surrounded by a semi-circular sweep of a small stream,\r\nlay the plain which had been the scene of the skirmish.\r\n\r\nIt was a melancholy spectacle. War and terror, to use the expression\r\nof the poet, had rushed on to the field, and left only wounds and death\r\nbehind them. The battle had been stoutly contested, as was almost always\r\nthe case with these Border skirmishes, where ancient hatred, and mutual\r\ninjuries, made men stubborn in maintaining the cause of their conflict.\r\nTowards the middle of the plain, there lay the bodies of several men who\r\nhad fallen in the very act of grappling with the enemy; and there\r\nwere seen countenances which still bore the stern expression of\r\nunextinguishable hate and defiance, hands which clasped the hilt of the\r\nbroken falchion, or strove in vain to pluck the deadly arrow from the\r\nwound. Some were wounded, and, cowed of the courage they had lately\r\nshown, were begging aid, and craving water, in a tone of melancholy\r\ndepression, while others tried to teach the faltering tongue to\r\npronounce some half-forgotten prayer, which, even when first learned,\r\nthey had but half understood. Halbert, uncertain what course he was next\r\nto pursue, rode through the plain to see if, among the dead or wounded,\r\nhe could discover any traces of his brother Edward. He experienced no\r\ninterruption from the English. A distant cloud of dust announced that\r\nthey were still pursuing the scattered fugitives, and he guessed, that\r\nto approach them with his followers, until they were again under some\r\ncommand, would be to throw away his own life, and that of his men, whom\r\nthe victors would instantly confound with the Scots, against whom they\r\nhad been successful. He resolved, therefore, to pause until Murray came\r\nup with his forces, to which he was the more readily moved, as he heard\r\nthe trumpets of the English Warden sounding the retreat, and recalling\r\nfrom the pursuit. He drew his men together, and made a stand in an\r\nadvantageous spot of ground, which had been occupied by the Scots in the\r\nbeginning of the action, and most fiercely disputed while the skirmish\r\nlasted.\r\n\r\nWhile he stood here, Halbert\'s ear was assailed by the feeble moan of\r\na woman, which he had not expected to hear amid that scene, until\r\nthe retreat of the foes had permitted the relations of the slain to\r\napproach, for the purpose of paying them the last duties. He looked with\r\nanxiety, and at length observed, that by the body of a knignt in bright\r\narmour, whose crest, though soiled and broken, still showed the marks\r\nof rank and birth, there sat a female wrapped in a horseman\'s cloak, and\r\nholding something pressed against her bosom, which he soon discovered to\r\nbe a child. He glanced towards the English. They advanced not, and the\r\ncontinued and prolonged sound of their trumpets, with the shouts of\r\nthe leaders, announced that their powers would not be instantly\r\nre-assembled. He had, therefore, a moment to look after this unfortunate\r\nwoman. He gave his horse to a spearman as he dismounted, and,\r\napproaching the unhappy female, asked her, in the most soothing tone he\r\ncould assume, whether he could assist her in her distress. The mourner\r\nmade him no direct answer; but endeavouring, with a trembling and\r\nunskilful hand, to undo the springs of the visor and gorget, said, in\r\na tone of impatient grief, "Oh, he would recover instantly could I but\r\ngive him air--land and living, life and honour, would I give for the\r\npower of undoing these cruel iron platings that suffocate him!" He that\r\nwould soothe sorrow must not argue on the vanity of the most deceitful\r\nhopes. The body lay as that of one whose last draught of vital air had\r\nbeen drawn, and who must never more have concern with the nether sky.\r\nBut Halbert Glendinning failed not to raise the visor and cast loose\r\nthe gorget, when, to his great surprise, he recognized the pale face of\r\nJulian Avenel. His last fight was over, the fierce and turbid spirit had\r\ndeparted in the strife in which it had so long delighted.\r\n\r\n"Alas! he is gone," said Halbert, speaking to the young woman, in whom\r\nhe had now no difficulty of knowing the unhappy Catherine.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, no, no!" she reiterated, "do not say so--he is not dead--he is\r\nbut in a swoon. I have lain as long in one myself--and then his voice\r\nwould arouse me, when he spoke kindly, and said, Catherine, look up\r\nfor my sake--And look up, Julian, for mine!" she said, addressing the\r\nsenseless corpse; "I know you do but counterfeit to frighten me, but I\r\nam not frightened," she added, with an hysterical attempt to laugh; and\r\nthen instantly changing her tone, entreated him to "speak, were it but\r\nto curse my folly. Oh, the rudest word you ever said to me would now\r\nsound like the dearest you wasted on me before I gave you all. Lift him\r\nup," she said, "lift him up, for God\'s sake!--have you no compassion? He\r\npromised to wed me if I bore him a boy, and this child is so like to\r\nits father!--How shall he keep his word, if you do not help me to awaken\r\nhim?--Christie of the Clinthill, Rowley, Hutcheon! ye were constant at\r\nhis feast, but ye fled from him at the fray, false villains as ye are!"\r\n\r\n"Not I, by Heaven!" said a dying man, who made some shift to raise\r\nhimself on his elbow, and discovered to Halbert the well-known features\r\nof Christie; "I fled not a foot, and a man can but fight while his\r\nbreath lasts--mine is going fast.--So, youngster," said he, looking at\r\nGlendinning, and seeing his military dress, "thou hast ta\'en the basnet\r\nat last? it is a better cap to live in than die in. I would chance had\r\nsent thy brother here instead--there was good in him--but thou art as\r\nwild, and wilt soon be as wicked as myself."\r\n\r\n"God forbid!" said Halbert, hastily.\r\n\r\n"Marry, and amen, with all my heart," said the wounded man, "there will\r\nbe company enow without thee where I am going. But God be praised I had\r\nno hand in that wickedness," said he, looking to poor Catherine; and\r\nwith some exclamation in his mouth, that sounded betwixt a prayer and\r\na curse, the soul of Christie of the Clinthill took wing to the last\r\naccount.\r\n\r\nDeeply wrapt in the painful interest which these shocking events had\r\nexcited, Glendinning forgot for a moment his own situation and duties,\r\nand was first recalled to them by a trampling of horse, and the cry of\r\nSaint George for England, which the English soldiers still continued\r\nto use. His handful of men, for most of the stragglers had waited for\r\nMurray\'s coming up, remained on horseback, holding their lances upright,\r\nhaving no command either to submit or resist.\r\n\r\n"There stands our Captain," said one of them, as a strong party of\r\nEnglish came up, the vanguard of Foster\'s troop.\r\n\r\n"Your Captain! with his sword sheathed, and on foot in the presence of\r\nhis enemy? a raw soldier, I warrant him," said the English leader. "So!\r\nho! young man, is your dream out, and will you now answer me if you will\r\nfight or fly?"\r\n\r\n"Neither," answered Halbert Glendinning, with great tranquillity.\r\n\r\n"Then throw down thy sword and yield thee," answered the Englishman.\r\n\r\n"Not till I can help myself no otherwise," said Halbert, with the same\r\nmoderation of tone and manner.\r\n\r\n"Art thou for thine own hand, friend, or to whom dost thou owe service?"\r\ndemanded the English Captain.\r\n\r\n"To the noble Earl of Murray."\r\n\r\n"Then thou servest," said the Southron, "the most disloyal nobleman who\r\nbreathes--false both to England and Scotland."\r\n\r\n"Thou liest," said Glendinning, regardless of all consequences.\r\n\r\n"Ha! art thou so hot how, and wert so cold but a minute since? I lie, do\r\nI? Wilt thou do battle with me on that quarrel?"\r\n\r\n"With one to one--one to two--or two to five, as you list," said Halbert\r\nGlendinning; "grant me but a fair field."\r\n\r\n"That thou shalt have.--Stand back, my mates," said the brave\r\nEnglishman. "If I fall, give him fair play, and let him go off free with\r\nhis people."\r\n\r\n"Long life to the noble Captain!" cried the soldiers, as impatient to\r\nsee the duel, as if it had been a bull-baiting.\r\n\r\n"He will have a short life of it, though," said the sergeant, "if he,\r\nan old man of sixty, is to fight, for any reason, or for no reason, with\r\nevery man he meets, and especially the young fellows he might be father\r\nto.--And here comes the Warden besides to see the sword-play."\r\n\r\nIn fact, Sir John Foster came up with a considerable body of his\r\nhorsemen, just as his Captain, whose age rendered him unequal to the\r\ncombat with so strong and active a youth as Glendinning, was deprived of\r\nhis sword.\r\n\r\n"Take it up for shame, old Stawarth Bolton," said the English Warden;\r\n"and thou, young man, tell me who and what thou art?"\r\n\r\n"A follower of the Earl of Murray, who bore his will to your honour,"\r\nanswered Glendinning,--"but here he comes to say it himself; I see the\r\nvan of his horsemen come over the hills."\r\n\r\n"Get into order, my masters," said Sir John Foster to his followers;\r\n"you that have broken your spears, draw your swords. We are something\r\nunprovided for a second field, but if yonder dark cloud on the hill edge\r\nbring us foul weather, we must bear as bravely as our broken cloaks\r\nwill bide it. Meanwhile, Stawarth, we have got the deer we have hunted\r\nfor--here is Piercie Shafton hard and fast betwixt two troopers."\r\n\r\n"Who, that lad?" said Bolton; "he is no more Piercie Shafton than I am.\r\nHe hath his gay cloak indeed--but Piercie Shafton is a round dozen of\r\nyears older than that slip of roguery. I have known him since he was\r\nthus high. Did you never see him in the tilt-yard or in the presence?"\r\n\r\n"To the devil with such vanities!" said Sir John Foster; "when had I\r\nleisure for them or any thing else? During my whole life has she kept me\r\nto this hangman\'s office, chasing thieves one day and traitors another,\r\nin daily fear of my life; the lance never hung up in the hall, the foot\r\nnever out of the stirrup, the saddles never off my nags\' backs; and\r\nnow, because I have been mistaken in the person of a man I never saw,\r\nI warrant me, the next letters from the Privy Council will rate me as I\r\nwere a dog--a man were better dead than thus slaved and harassed."\r\n\r\nA trumpet interrupted Foster\'s complaints, and a Scottish pursuivant who\r\nattended, declared "that the noble Earl of Murray desired, in all honour\r\nand safety, a personal conference with Sir John Foster, midway between\r\ntheir parties, with six of company in each, and ten free minutes to come\r\nand go."\r\n\r\n"And now," said the Englishman, "comes another plague. I must go speak\r\nwith yonder false Scot, and he knows how to frame his devices, to cast\r\ndust in the eyes of a plain man, as well as ever a knave in the north.\r\nI am no match for him in words, and for hard blows we are but too ill\r\nprovided.--Pursuivant, we grant the conference--and you, Sir Swordsman,"\r\n(speaking to young Glendinning,) "draw off with your troopers to your\r\nown party--march--attend your Earl\'s trumpet.--Stawarth Bolton, put\r\nour troop in order, and be ready to move forward at the wagging of a\r\nfinger.--Get you gone to your own friends, I tell you, Sir Squire, and\r\nloiter not here."\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this peremptory order, Halbert Glendinning could not\r\nhelp stopping to cast a look upon the unfortunate Catherine, who lay\r\ninsensible of the danger and of the trampling of so many horses around\r\nher, insensible, as the second glance assured him, of all and forever.\r\nGlendinning almost rejoiced when he saw that the last misery of life\r\nwas over, and that the hoofs of the war-horses, amongst which he was\r\ncompelled to leave her, could only injure and deface a senseless\r\ncorpse. He caught the infant from her arms, half ashamed of the shout\r\nof laughter which rose on all sides, at seeing an armed man in such a\r\nsituation assume such an unwonted and inconvenient burden.\r\n\r\n"Shoulder your infant!" cried a harquebusier.\r\n\r\n"Port your infant!" said a pikeman.\r\n\r\n"Peace, ye brutes," said Stawarth Bolton, "and respect humanity in\r\nothers if you have none yourselves. I pardon the lad having done some\r\ndiscredit to my gray hairs, when I see him take care of that helpless\r\ncreature, which ye would have trampled upon as if ye had been littered\r\nof bitch-wolves, not born of women."\r\n\r\nWhile this passed, the leaders on either side met in the neutral space\r\nbetwixt the forces of either, and the Earl accosted the English Warden:\r\n\r\n"Is this fair or honest usage, Sir John, or for whom do you hold the\r\nEarl of Morton and myself, that you ride in Scotland with arrayed\r\nbanner, fight, slay, and make prisoners at your own pleasure? Is it well\r\ndone, think you, to spoil our land and shed our blood, after the many\r\nproofs we have given to your mistress of our devotion due to her will,\r\nsaving always the allegiance due to our own sovereign?"\r\n\r\n"My Lord of Murray," answered Foster, "all the world knows you to be a\r\nman of quick ingine and deep wisdom, and these several weeks you have\r\nheld me in hand with promising to arrest my sovereign mistress\'s rebel,\r\nthis Piercie Shafton of Wilverton, and you have never kept your word,\r\nalleging turmoils in the west, and I wot not what other causes of\r\nhinderance. Now, since he has had the insolence to return hither, and\r\nlive openly within ten miles of England, I could no longer, in plain\r\nduty to my mistress and queen, tarry upon your successive delays, and\r\ntherefore I have used her force to take her rebel, by the strong hand,\r\nwherever I can find him."\r\n\r\n"And is Piercie Shafton in your hands, then?" said the Earl of Murray.\r\n"Be aware that I may not, without my own great shame, suffer you to\r\nremove him hence without doing battle."\r\n\r\n"Will you, Lord Earl, after all the advantages you have received at the\r\nhands of the Queen of England, do battle in the cause of her rebel?"\r\nsaid Sir John Foster.\r\n\r\n"Not so, Sir John," answered the Earl, "but I will fight to the death in\r\ndefence of the liberties of our free kingdom of Scotland."\r\n\r\n"By my faith," said Sir John Foster, "I am well content--my sword is not\r\nblunted with all it has done yet this day."\r\n\r\n"By my honour, Sir John," said Sir George Heron of Chipchase, "there is\r\nbut little reason we should fight these Scottish Lords e\'en now, for I\r\nhold opinion with old Stawarth Bolton, and believe yonder prisoner to be\r\nno more Piercie Shafton than he is the Earl of Northumberland; and you\r\nwere but ill advised to break the peace betwixt the countries for a\r\nprisoner of less consequence than that gay mischief-maker."\r\n\r\n"Sir George," replied Foster, "I have often heard you herons are afraid\r\nof hawks--Nay, lay not hand on sword, man--I did but jest; and for this\r\nprisoner, let him be brought up hither, that we may see who or what\r\nhe is--always under assurance, my Lords," he continued, addressing the\r\nScots.\r\n\r\n"Upon our word and honour," said Morton, "we will offer no violence."\r\n\r\nThe laugh turned against Sir John Foster considerably, when the\r\nprisoner, being brought up, proved not only a different person from Sir\r\nPiercie Shafton, but a female in man\'s attire.\r\n\r\n"Pluck the mantle from the quean\'s face, and cast her to the\r\nhorse-boys," said Foster; "she has kept such company ere now, I\r\nwarrant."\r\n\r\nEven Murray was moved to laughter, no common thing with him, at the\r\ndisappointment of the English Warden; but he would not permit any\r\nviolence to be offered to the fair Molinara, who had thus a second time\r\nrescued Sir Piercie Shafton at her own personal risk.\r\n\r\n"You have already done more mischief than you can well answer," said the\r\nEarl to the English Warden, "and it were dishonour to me should I permit\r\nyou to harm a hair of this young woman\'s head."\r\n\r\n"My lord," said Morton, "if Sir John will ride apart with me but for\r\none moment, I will show him such reasons as shall make him content to\r\ndepart, and to refer this unhappy day\'s work to the judgment of the\r\nCommissioners nominated to try offences on the Border."\r\n\r\nHe then led Sir John Foster aside, and spoke to him in this\r\nmanner:--"Sir John Foster, I much marvel that a man who knows your Queen\r\nElizabeth as you do, should not know that, if you hope any thing from\r\nher, it must be for doing her useful service, not for involving her in\r\nquarrels with her neighbours without any advantage. Sir Knight, I will\r\nspeak frankly what I know to be true. Had you seized the true Piercie\r\nShafton by this ill-advised inroad; and had your deed threatened, as\r\nmost likely it might, a breach betwixt the countries, your politic\r\nprincess and her politic council would rather have disgraced Sir John\r\nFoster than entered into war in his behalf. But now that you have\r\nstricken short of your aim, you may rely on it you will have little\r\nthanks for carrying the matter farther. I will work thus far on the Earl\r\nof Murray, that he will undertake to dismiss Sir Piercie Shafton from\r\nthe realm of Scotland.--Be well advised, and let the matter now pass\r\noff--you will gain nothing by farther violence, for if we fight, you as\r\nthe fewer and the weaker through your former action, will needs have the\r\nworse."\r\n\r\nSir John Foster listened with his head declining on his breast-plate.\r\n\r\n"It is a cursed chance," he said, "and I shall have little thanks for my\r\nday\'s work."\r\n\r\nHe then rode up to Murray, and said, that, in deference to his\r\nLordship\'s presence and that of my Lord of Morton, he had come to the\r\nresolution of withdrawing himself, with his power, without farther\r\nproceedings.\r\n\r\n"Stop there, Sir John Foster," said Murray; "I cannot permit you\r\nto retire in safety, unless you leave some one who may be surety to\r\nScotland, that the injuries you have at present done us may be fully\r\naccounted for--you will reflect, that by permitting your retreat, I\r\nbecome accountable to my Sovereign, who will demand a reckoning of me\r\nfor the blood of her subjects, if I suffer those who shed it to depart\r\nso easily."\r\n\r\n"It shall never be told in England," said the Warden, "that John Foster\r\ngave pledges like a subdued man, and that on the very field on which he\r\nstands victorious.--But," he added, after a moment\'s pause, "if Stawarth\r\nBolton wills to abide with you on his own free choice, I will say\r\nnothing against it; and, as I bethink me, it were better he should stay\r\nto see the dismissal of this same Piercie Shafton."\r\n\r\n"I receive him as your hostage, nevertheless, and shall treat him as\r\nsuch," said the Earl of Murray. But Foster, turning away as if to give\r\ndirections to Bolton and his men, affected not to hear this observation.\r\n\r\n"There rides a faithful servant of his most beautiful and Sovereign\r\nLady," said Murray aside to Morton. "Happy man! he knows not whether the\r\nexecution of her commands may not cost him his head; and yet he is most\r\ncertain that to leave them unexecuted will bring disgrace and death\r\nwithout reprieve. Happy are they who are not only subjected to the\r\ncaprices of Dame Fortune, but held bound to account and be responsible\r\nfor them, and that to a sovereign as moody and fickle as her humorous\r\nladyship herself!"\r\n\r\n"We also have a female Sovereign, my lord," said Morton.\r\n\r\n"We have so, Douglas," said the Earl,--with a suppressed sigh; "but it\r\nremains to be seen how long a female hand can hold the reins of power\r\nin a realm so wild as ours. We will now go on to Saint Mary\'s, and see\r\nourselves after the state of that House.--Glendinning, look to that\r\nwoman, and protect her.--What the fiend, man, hast thou got in thine\r\narms?--an infant as I live!--where couldst thou find such a charge, at\r\nsuch a place and moment?"\r\n\r\nHalbert Glendinning briefly told the story. The Earl rode forward to the\r\nplace where the body of Julian Avenel lay, with his unhappy companion\'s\r\narms wrapped around him like the trunk of an uprooted oak borne down by\r\nthe tempest with all its ivy garlands. Both were cold dead. Murray was\r\ntouched in an unwonted degree, remembering, perhaps, his own birth.\r\n"What have they to answer for, Douglas," he said, "who thus abuse the\r\nsweetest gifts of affection?"\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Morton, unhappy in his marriage, was a libertine in his\r\namours.\r\n\r\n"You must ask that question of Henry Warden, my lord, or of John Knox--I\r\nam but a wild counsellor in women\'s matters."\r\n\r\n"Forward to Saint Mary\'s," said the Earl; "pass the word\r\non--Glendinning, give the infant to this same female cavalier, and let\r\nit be taken charge of. Let no dishonour be done to the dead bodies,\r\nand call on the country to bury or remove them.--Forward, I say, my\r\nmasters!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter the Thirty-Seventh.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Gone to be married?--Gone to swear a peace!\r\n\r\nKING JOHN\r\n\r\nThe news of the lost battle, so quickly carried by the fugitives to\r\nthe village and convent, had spread the greatest alarm among the\r\ninhabitants. The Sacristan and other monks counselled flight; the\r\nTreasurer recommended that the church plate should be offered as a\r\ntribute to bribe the English officer; the Abbot alone was unmoved and\r\nundaunted.\r\n\r\n"My brethren," he said, "since God has not given our people victory\r\nin the combat, it must be because he requires of us, his spiritual\r\nsoldiers, to fight the good fight of martyrdom, a conflict in which\r\nnothing but our own faint-hearted cowardice can make us fail of\r\nvictory. Let us assume, then, the armour of faith, and prepare, if it\r\nbe necessary, to die under the ruin of these shrines, to the service\r\nof which we have devoted ourselves. Highly honoured are we all in this\r\ndistinguished summons, from our dear brother Nicholas, whose gray hairs\r\nhave been preserved until they should be surrounded by the crown of\r\nmartyrdom, down to my beloved son Edward, who, arriving at the vineyard\r\nat the latest hour of the day, is yet permitted to share its toils\r\nwith those who have laboured from the morning. Be of good courage, my\r\nchildren. I dare not, like my sainted predecessors, promise to you that\r\nyou shall be preserved by miracle--I and you are alike unworthy of that\r\nespecial interposition, which, in earlier times, turned the sword of\r\nsacrilege against the bosom of tyrants by whom it was wielded, daunted\r\nthe hardened hearts of heretics with prodigies, and called down hosts of\r\nangels to defend the shrine of God and of the Virgin. Yet, by heavenly\r\naid, you shall this day see that your Father and Abbot will not disgrace\r\nthe mitre which sits upon his brow. Go to your cells, my children, and\r\nexercise your private devotions. Array yourselves also in alb and cope,\r\nas for our most solemn festivals, and be ready, when the tolling of the\r\nlargest bell announces the approach of the enemy, to march forth to\r\nmeet them in solemn procession. Let the church be opened to afford such\r\nrefuge as may be to those of our vassals, who, from their exertion in\r\nthis day\'s unhappy battle, or the cause, are particularly apprehensive\r\nof the rage of the enemy. Tell Sir Piercie Shafton, if he has escaped\r\nthe fight--"\r\n\r\n"I am here, most venerable Abbot," replied Sir Piercie; "and if it so\r\nseemeth meet to you, I will presently assemble such of the men as have\r\nescaped this escaramouche, and will renew the resistance, even unto\r\nthe death. Certes, you will learn from all, that I did my part in this\r\nunhappy matter. Had it pleased Julian Avenel to have attended to my\r\ncounsel, specially in somewhat withdrawing of his main battle, even as\r\nyou may have marked the heron eschew the stoop of the falcon, receiving\r\nhim rather upon his beak than upon his wing, affairs, as I do conceive,\r\nmight have had a different face, and we might then, in a more bellacose\r\nmanner, have maintained that affray. Nevertheless, I would not be\r\nunderstood to speak any thing in disregard of Julian Avenel, whom I saw\r\nfall fighting manfully with his face to his enemy, which hath banished\r\nfrom my memory the unseemly term of \'meddling coxcomb,\' with which it\r\npleased him something rashly to qualify my advice, and for which, had\r\nit pleased Heaven and the saints to have prolonged the life of that\r\nexcellent person, I had it bound upon my soul to have put him to death\r\nwith my own hand."\r\n\r\n"Sir Piercie," said the Abbot, at length interrupting him, "our time\r\nallows brief leisure to speak what might have been."\r\n\r\n"You are right, most venerable Lord and Father," replied the\r\nincorrigible Euphuist; "the preterite, as grammarians have it, concerns\r\nfrail mortality less than the future mood, and indeed our cogitations\r\nrespect chiefly the present. In a word, I am willing to head all who\r\nwill follow me, and offer such opposition as manhood and mortality may\r\npermit, to the advance of the English, though they be my own countrymen;\r\nand be assured, Piercie Shafton will measure his length, being five feet\r\nten inches, on the ground as he stands, rather than give two yards in\r\nretreat, according to the usual motion in which we retrograde."\r\n\r\n"I thank you, Sir Knight," said the Abbot, "and I doubt not that you\r\nwould make your words good; but it is not the will of Heaven that carnal\r\nweapons should rescue us. We are called to endure, not to resist, and\r\nmay not waste the blood of our innocent commons in vain--Fruitless\r\nopposition becomes not men of our profession; they have my commands to\r\nresign the sword and the spear,--God and Our Lady have not blessed our\r\nbanner."\r\n\r\n"Bethink you, reverend lord," said Piercie Shafton, very eagerly, "ere\r\nyou resign the defence that is in your power--there are many posts near\r\nthe entry of this village, where brave men might live or die to the\r\nadvantage; and I have this additional motive to make defence,--the\r\nsafety, namely, of a fair friend, who, I hope, hath escaped the hands of\r\nthe heretics."\r\n\r\n"I understand you, Sir Piercie," said the Abbot--"you mean the daughter\r\nof our Convent\'s miller?"\r\n\r\n"Reverend my lord," said Sir Piercie, not without hesitation, "the fair\r\nMysinda is, as may be in some sort alleged, the daughter of one who\r\nmechanically prepareth corn to be manipulated into bread, without which\r\nwe could not exist, and which is therefore an employment in itself\r\nhonourable, nay necessary. Nevertheless, if the purest sentiments of a\r\ngenerous mind, streaming forth like the rays of the sun reflected by\r\na diamond, may ennoble one, who is in some sort the daughter of a\r\nmolendinary mechanic----"\r\n\r\n"I have no time for all this, Sir Knight," said the Abbot; "be it enough\r\nto answer, that with our will we war no longer with carnal weapons. We\r\nof the spirituality will teach you of the temporality how to die in cold\r\nblood, our hands not clenched for resistance, but folded for prayer--our\r\nminds not filled with jealous hatred, but with Christian meekness and\r\nforgiveness--our ears not deafened, nor our senses confused, by the\r\nsound of clamorous instruments of war; but, on the contrary, our voices\r\ncomposed to Halleluiah, Kyrie-Eleison, and Salve Regina, and our blood\r\ntemperate and cold, as those who think upon reconciling themselves with\r\nGod, not of avenging themselves of their fellow-mortals."\r\n\r\n"Lord Abbot," said Sir Piercie, "this is nothing to the fate of my\r\nMolinara, whom I beseech you to observe, I will not abandon, while\r\ngolden hilt and steel blade bide together on my falchion. I commanded\r\nher not to follow us to the field, and yet methought I saw her in her\r\npage\'s attire amongst the rear of the combatants."\r\n\r\n"You must seek elsewhere for the person in whose fate you are so\r\ndeeply interested," said the Abbot; "and at present I will pray of your\r\nknighthood to inquire concerning her at the church, in which all our\r\nmore defenceless vassals have taken refuge. It is my advice to you, that\r\nyou also abide by the horns of the altar; and, Sir Piercie Shafton,"\r\nhe added, "be of one thing secure, that if you come to harm, it will\r\ninvolve the whole of this brotherhood; for never, I trust, will the\r\nmeanest of us buy safety at the expense of surrendering a friend or a\r\nguest. Leave us, my son, and may God be your aid!"\r\n\r\nWhen Sir Piercie Shafton had departed, and the Abbot was about to betake\r\nhimself to his own cell, he was surprised by an unknown person anxiously\r\nrequiring a conference, who, being admitted, proved to be no other\r\nthan Henry Warden. The Abbot started as he entered, and exclaimed,\r\nangrily,--"Ha! are the few hours that fate allows him who may last wear\r\nthe mitre of this house, not to be excused from the intrusion of heresy?\r\nDost thou come," he said, "to enjoy the hopes which fete holds out to\r\nthy demented and accursed sect, to see the bosom of destruction sweep\r\naway the pride of old religion--to deface our shrines,--to mutilate and\r\nlay waste the bodies of our benefactors, as well as their sepulchres--to\r\ndestroy the pinnacles and carved work of God\'s house, and Our Lady\'s?"\r\n\r\n"Peace, William Allan!" said the Protestant preacher, with dignified\r\ncomposure; "for none of these purposes do I come. I would have these\r\nstately shrines deprived of the idols which, no longer simply regarded\r\nas the effigies of the good and of the wise, have become the objects of\r\nfoul idolatry. I would otherwise have its ornaments subsist, unless as\r\nthey are, or may be, a snare to the souls of men; and especially do\r\nI condemn those ravages which have been made by the heady fury of the\r\npeople, stung into zeal against will-worship by bloody persecution.\r\nAgainst such wanton devastations I lift my testimony."\r\n\r\n"Idle distinguisher that thou art!" said the Abbot Eustace, interrupting\r\nhim; "what signifies the pretext under which thou dost despoil the house\r\nof God? and why at this present emergence will thou insult the master of\r\nit by thy ill-omened presence?"\r\n\r\n"Thou art unjust, William Allan," said Warden; "but I am not the less\r\nsettled in my resolution. Thou hast protected me some time since at the\r\nhazard of thy rank, and what I know thou holdest still dearer, at the\r\nrisk of thy reputation with thine own sect. Our party is now uppermost,\r\nand, believe me, I have come down the valley, in which thou didst\r\nquarter me for sequestration\'s sake, simply with the wish to keep my\r\nengagements to thee."\r\n\r\n"Ay," answered the Abbot, "and it may be, that my listening to that\r\nworldly and infirm compassion which pleaded with me for thy life, is now\r\navenged by this impending judgment. Heaven hath smitten, it may be, the\r\nerring shepherd, and scattered the flock."\r\n\r\n"Think better of the Divine judgments," said Warden. "Not for thy sins,\r\nwhich are those of thy blended education and circumstances; not\r\nfor thine own sins, William Allan, art thou stricken, but for the\r\naccumulated guilt which thy mis-named Church hath accumulated on her\r\nhead, and those of her votaries, by the errors and corruption of ages."\r\n\r\n"Now, by my sure belief in the Rock of Peter," said the Abbot, "thou\r\ndost rekindle the last spark of human indignation for which my bosom\r\nhas fuel--I thought I might not again have felt the impulse of earthly\r\npassion, and it is thy voice which once more calls me to the expression\r\nof human anger! yes, it is thy voice that comest to insult me in my hour\r\nof sorrow, with these blasphemous accusations of that church which hath\r\nkept the light of Christianity alive from the times of the Apostles till\r\nnow."\r\n\r\n"From the times of the Apostles?" said the preacher, eagerly. "_Negatur,\r\nGulielme Allan_--the primitive church differed as much from that of\r\nRome, as did light from darkness, which, did time permit, I should\r\nspeedily prove. And worse dost thou judge, in saying, I come to insult\r\nthee in thy hour of affliction, being here, God wot, with the Christian\r\nwish of fulfilling an engagement I had made to my host, and of rendering\r\nmyself to thy will while it had yet power to exercise aught upon me,\r\nand if it might so be, to mitigate in thy behalf the rage of the victors\r\nwhom God hath sent as a scourge to thy obstinacy."\r\n\r\n"I will none of thy intercession," said the Abbot, sternly; "the dignity\r\nto which the church has exalted me, never should have swelled my bosom\r\nmore proudly in the time of the highest prosperity, than it doth at this\r\ncrisis--I ask nothing of thee, but the assurance that my lenity to thee\r\nhath been the means of perverting no soul to Satan, that I have not\r\ngiven to the wolf any of the stray lambs whom the Great Shepherd of\r\nsouls had intrusted to my charge."\r\n\r\n"William Allan," answered the Protestant, "I will be sincere with thee.\r\nWhat I promised I have kept--I have withheld my voice from speaking even\r\ngood things. But it has pleased Heaven to call the maiden Mary Avenel\r\nto a better sense of faith than thou and all the disciples of Rome can\r\nteach. Her I have aided with my humble power--I have extricated her from\r\nthe machinations of evil spirits to which she and her house were exposed\r\nduring the blindness of their Romish superstition, and, praise be to\r\nmy Master, I have not reason to fear she will again be caught in thy\r\nsnares."\r\n\r\n"Wretched man!" said the Abbot, unable to suppress his rising\r\nindignation, "is it to the Abbot of St. Mary\'s that you boast having\r\nmisled the soul of a dweller in Our Lady\'s Halidome into the paths of\r\nfoul error and damning heresy?--Thou dost urge me, Wellwood, beyond what\r\nit becomes me to bear, and movest me to employ the few moments of power\r\nI may yet possess, in removing from the face of the earth one whose\r\nqualities, given by God, have been so utterly perverted as thine to the\r\nservice of Satan."\r\n\r\n"Do thy pleasure," said the preacher; "thy vain wrath shall not prevent\r\nmy doing my duty to advantage thee, where it may be done without\r\nneglecting my higher call. I go to the Earl of Murray."\r\n\r\nTheir conference, which was advancing fast into bitter disputation, was\r\nhere interrupted by the deep and sullen toll of the largest and heaviest\r\nbell of the Convent, a sound famous in the chronicles of the Community,\r\nfor dispelling of tempests, and putting to flight demons, but which now\r\nonly announced danger, without affording any means of warding against\r\nit. Hastily repeating his orders, that all the brethren should attend\r\nin the choir, arrayed for solemn procession, the Abbot ascended to the\r\nbattlements of the lofty Monastery, by his own private staircase,\r\nand there met the Sacristan, who had been in the act of directing the\r\ntolling of the huge bell, which fell under his charge.\r\n\r\n"It is the last time I shall discharge mine office, most venerable\r\nFather and Lord," said he to the Abbot, "for yonder come the\r\nPhilistines; but I would not that the large bell of Saint Mary\'s should\r\nsound for the last time, otherwise than in true and full tone--I have\r\nbeen a sinful man for one of our holy profession," added he, looking\r\nupward, "yet may I presume to say, not a bell hath sounded out of tune\r\nfrom the tower of the house, while Father Philip had the superintendence\r\nof the chime and the belfry."\r\n\r\nThe Abbot, without reply, cast his eyes towards the path, which, winding\r\naround the mountain, descends upon Kennaquhair, from the south-east.\r\nHe beheld at a distance a cloud of dust, and heard the neighing of many\r\nhorses, while the occasional sparkle of the long line of spears, as they\r\ncame downwards into the valley, announced that the band came thither in\r\narms.\r\n\r\n"Shame on my weakness!" said Abbot Eustace, dashing the tears from his\r\neyes; "my sight is too much dimmed to observe their motions--look, my\r\nson Edward," for his favourite novice had again joined him, "and tell me\r\nwhat ensigns they bear."\r\n\r\n"They are Scottish men, when all is done!" exclaimed Edward--"I see the\r\nwhite crosses--it may be the Western Borderers, or Fernieherst and his\r\nclan."\r\n\r\n"Look at the banner," said the Abbot; "tell me, what are the\r\nblazonries?"\r\n\r\n"The arms of Scotland," said Edward, "the lion and its tressure,\r\nquartered, as I think, with three cushions--Can it be the royal\r\nstandard?"\r\n\r\n"Alas! no," said the Abbot, "it is that of the Earl of Murray. He hath\r\nassumed with his new conquest the badge of the valiant Randolph, and\r\nhath dropt from his hereditary coat the bend which indicates his own\r\nbase birth--would to God he may not have blotted it also from his\r\nmemory, and aim as well at possessing the name, as the power, of a\r\nking."\r\n\r\n"At least, my father," said Edward, "he will secure us from the violence\r\nof the Southron."\r\n\r\n"Ay, my son, as the shepherd secures a silly lamb from the wolf, which\r\nhe destines in due time to his own banquet. Oh my son, evil days are on\r\nus! A breach has been made in the walls of our sanctuary--thy\r\nbrother hath fallen from the faith. Such news brought my last secret\r\nintelligence--Murray hath already spoken of rewarding his services with\r\nthe hand of Mary Avenel."\r\n\r\n"Of Mary Avenel!" said the novice, tottering towards and grasping hold\r\nof one of the carved pinnacles which adorned the proud battlement.\r\n\r\n"Ay, of Mary Avenel, my son, who has also abjured the faith of her\r\nfathers. Weep not, my Edward, weep not, my beloved son! or weep for\r\ntheir apostasy, and not for their union--Bless God, who hath called thee\r\nto himself, out of the tents of wickedness; but for the grace of Our\r\nLady and Saint Benedict, thou also hadst been a castaway."\r\n\r\n"I endeavour, my father," said Edward, "I endeavour to forget; but what\r\nI would now blot from my memory has been the thought of all my former\r\nlife--Murray dare not forward a match so unequal in birth."\r\n\r\n"He dares do what suits his purpose--The Castle of Avenel is strong, and\r\nneeds a good castellan, devoted to his service; as for the difference\r\nof their birth, he will mind it no more than he would mind defacing the\r\nnatural regularity of the ground, were it necessary he should erect upon\r\nit military lines and intrenchments. But do not droop for that--awaken\r\nthy soul within thee, my son. Think you part with a vain vision, an idle\r\ndream, nursed in solitude and inaction.--I weep not, yet what am I\r\nnow like to lose?--Look at these towers, where saints dwelt, and where\r\nheroes have been buried--Think that I, so briefly called to preside\r\nover the pious flock, which has dwelt here since the first light of\r\nChristianity, may be this day written down the last father of this holy\r\ncommunity--Come, let us descend, and meet our fate. I see them approach\r\nnear to the village."\r\n\r\nThe Abbot descended, the novice cast a glance around him; yet the sense\r\nof the danger impending over the stately structure, with which he was\r\nnow united, was unable to banish the recollection of Mary Ayenel.--"His\r\nbrother\'s bride!" he pulled the cowl over his face, and followed his\r\nSuperior.\r\n\r\nThe whole bells of the Abbey now added their peal to the death-toll of\r\nthe largest which had so long sounded. The monks wept and prayed as they\r\ngot themselves into the order of their procession for the last time, as\r\nseemed but too probable.\r\n\r\n"It is well our Father Boniface hath retired to the inland," said Father\r\nPhilip; "he could never have put over this day--it would have broken his\r\nheart!"\r\n\r\n"God be with the soul of Abbot Ingelram!" said old Father Nicholas,\r\n"there were no such doings in his days.--They say we are to be put forth\r\nof the cloisters; and how I am to live any where else than where I have\r\nlived for these seventy years, I wot not--the best is, that I have not\r\nlong to live any where."\r\n\r\nA few moments after this the great gate of the Abbey was flung open,\r\nand the procession moved slowly forward from beneath its huge and\r\nrichly-adorned gateway. Cross and banner, pix and chalice, shrines\r\ncontaining relics, and censers steaming with incense, preceded and were\r\nintermingled with the long and solemn array of the brotherhood, in their\r\nlong black gowns and cowls, with their white scapularies hanging over\r\nthem, the various officers of the convent each displaying his proper\r\nbadge of office. In the centre of the procession came the Abbot,\r\nsurrounded and supported by his chief assistants. He was dressed in his\r\nhabit of high solemnity, and appeared as much unconcerned as if he had\r\nbeen taking his usual part in some ordinary ceremony. After him came\r\nthe inferior persons of the convent; the novices in their albs or white\r\ndresses, and the lay brethren distinguished by their beards, which were\r\nseldom worn by the Fathers. Women and children, mixed with a few men,\r\ncame in the rear, bewailing the apprehended desolation of their ancient\r\nsanctuary. They moved, however, in order, and restrained the marks of\r\ntheir sorrow to a low wailing sound, which rather mingled with than\r\ninterrupted the measured chant of the monks.\r\n\r\nIn this order the procession entered the market-place of the village of\r\nKennaquhair, which was then, as now, distinguished by an ancient cross\r\nof curious workmanship, the gift of some former monarch of Scotland.\r\nClose by the cross, of much greater antiquity, and scarcely less\r\nhonoured, was an immensely large oak-tree, which perhaps had witnessed\r\nthe worship of the Druids, ere the stately Monastery to which it\r\nadjoined had raised its spires in honour of the Christian faith. Like\r\nthe Bentang-tree of the African villages, or the Plaistow-oak mentioned\r\nin White\'s Natural History of Selborne, this tree was the rendezvous of\r\nthe villagers, and regarded with peculiar veneration; a feeling common\r\nto most nations, and which perhaps may be traced up to the remote period\r\nwhen the patriarch feasted the angels under the oak at Mamre. [Footnote:\r\nIt is scarcely necessary to say, that in Melrose, the prototype of\r\nKennaquhair, no such oak ever existed.]\r\n\r\nThe monks formed themselves each in their due place around the cross,\r\nwhile under the ruins of the aged tree crowded the old and the feeble,\r\nwith others who felt the common alarm. When they had thus arranged\r\nthemselves, there was a deep and solemn pause. The monks stilled their\r\nchant, the lay populace hushed their lamentations, and all awaited in\r\nterror and silence the arrival of those heretical forces, whom they had\r\nbeen so long taught to regard with fear and trembling.\r\n\r\nA distant trampling was at length heard, and the glance of spears was\r\nseen to shine through the trees above the village. The sounds increased,\r\nand became more thick, one close continuous rushing sound, in which the\r\ntread of hoofs was mingled with the ringing of armour. The horsemen soon\r\nappeared at the principal entrance which leads into the irregular square\r\nor market-place which forms the centre of the village. They entered two\r\nby two, slowly, and in the greatest order. The van continued to move on,\r\nriding round the open spaoe, until they had attained the utmost point,\r\nand then turning their horses\' heads to the street, stood fast; their\r\ncompanions followed in the same order, until the whole market-place was\r\nclosely surrounded with soldiers; and the files who followed, making the\r\nsame manoeuvre, formed an inner line within those who had first arrived,\r\nuntil the place was begirt with a quadruple file of horsemen closely\r\ndrawn up. There was now a pause, of which the Abbot availed himself,\r\nby commanding the brotherhood to raise the solemn chant _De profundis\r\nclamavi_. He looked around the armed ranks, to see what impression the\r\nsolemn sounds made on them. All were silent, but the brows of some\r\nhad an expression of contempt, and almost all the rest bore a look of\r\nindifference; their course had been too long decided to permit past\r\nfeelings of enthusiasm to be anew awakened by a procession or by a hymn.\r\n\r\n\r\n"Their hearts are hardened," said the Abbot to himself in dejection, but\r\nnot in despair; "it remains to see whether those of their leaders are\r\nequally obdurate."\r\n\r\nThe leaders, in the meanwhile, were advancing slowly, and Murray, with\r\nMorton, rode in deep conversation before a chosen band of their most\r\ndistinguished followers, amongst whom came Halbert Glendinning. But the\r\npreacher Henry Warden, who, upon leaving the Monastery, had instantly\r\njoined them, was the only person admitted to their conference.\r\n\r\n"You are determined, then," said Morton to Murray, "to give the heiress\r\nof Avenel, with all her pretensions, to this nameless and obscure young\r\nman?"\r\n\r\n"Hath not Warden told you," said Murray, "that they have been bred\r\ntogether, and are lovers from their youth upward?"\r\n\r\n"And that they are both," said Warden, "by means which may be almost\r\ntermed miraculous, rescued from the delusions of Rome, and brought\r\nwithin the pale of the true church. My residence at Glendearg hath made\r\nme well acquainted with these things. Ill would it beseem my habit and\r\nmy calling, to thrust myself into match-making and giving in marriage,\r\nbut worse were it in me to see your lordships do needless wrong to\r\nthe feelings which are proper to our nature, and which, being indulged\r\nhonestly and under the restraints of religion, become a pledge of\r\ndomestic quiet here, and future happiness in a better world. I say, that\r\nyou will do ill to rend those ties asunder, and to give this maiden to\r\nthe kinsman of Lord Morton, though Lord Morton\'s kinsman he be."\r\n\r\n"These are fair reasons, my Lord of Murray," said Morton, "why you\r\nshould refuse me so simple a boon as to bestow this silly damsel upon\r\nyoung Bennygask. Speak out plainly, my lord; say you would rather see\r\nthe Castle of Avenel in the hands of one who owes his name and existence\r\nsolely to your favour, than in the power of a Douglas, and of my\r\nkinsman."\r\n\r\n"My Lord of Morton," said Murray, "I have done nothing in this matter\r\nwhich should aggrieve you. This young man Glendinning has done me good\r\nservice, and may do me more. My promise was in some degree passed to\r\nhim, and that while Julian Avenel was alive, when aught beside the\r\nmaiden\'s lily hand would have been hard to come by; whereas, you never\r\nthought of such an alliance for your kinsman, till you saw Julian lie\r\ndead yonder on the field, and knew his land to be a waif free to the\r\nfirst who could seize it. Come, come, my lord, you do less than justice\r\nto your gallant kinsman, in wishing him a bride bred up under the\r\nmilk-pail; for this girl is a peasant wench in all but the accident\r\nof birth. I thought you had more deep respect for the honour of the\r\nDouglasses."\r\n\r\n"The honour of the Douglasses is safe in my keeping," answered Morton,\r\nhaughtily; "that of other ancient families may suffer as well as the\r\nname of Avenel, if rustics are to be matched with the blood of our\r\nancient barons."\r\n\r\n"This is but idle talking," answered Lord Murray; "in times like these,\r\nwe must look to men and not to pedigrees. Hay was but a rustic before\r\nthe battle of Loncarty--the bloody yoke actually dragged the plough ere\r\nit was emblazoned on a crest by the herald. Times of action make princes\r\ninto peasants, and boors into barons. All families have sprung from one\r\nmean man; and it is well if they have never degenerated from his virtue\r\nwho raised them first from obscurity."\r\n\r\n"My Lord of Murray will please to except the house of Douglas," said\r\nMorton, haughtily; "men have seen it in the tree, but never in the\r\nsapling--have seen it in the stream, but never in the fountain.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: The late excellent and laborious antiquary, Mr. George\r\nChalmers, has rebuked the vaunt of the House of Douglas, or rather\r\nof Hume of Godscroft, their historian, but with less than his wonted\r\naccuracy. In the first volume of his Caledonia, he quotes the passage in\r\nGodscroft for the purpose of confuting it.\r\n\r\nThe historian (of the Douglasses) cries out, "We do not know them in the\r\nfountain, but in the stream; not in the root, but in the stem; for we\r\nknow not which is the mean man that did rise above the vulgar." This\r\nassumption Mr. Chalmers conceives ill-timed, and alleges, that if the\r\nhistorian had attended more to research than to declamation, he might\r\neasily have seen the first mean man of this renowned family. This\r\nhe alleges to have been one Theobaldus Flammaticus, or Theobald the\r\nFleming, to whom Arnold, Abbot of Kelso, between the year 1147 and 1160,\r\ngranted certain lands on Douglas water, by a deed which Mr. Chalmers\r\nconceives to be the first link of the chain of title-deeds to\r\nDouglasdale. Hence, he says, the family must renounce their family\r\ndomain, or acknowledge this obscure Fleming as their ancestor. Theobald\r\nthe Fleming, it is acknowledged, did not himself assume the name of\r\nDouglas; "but," says the antiquary, "his son William, who inherited\r\nhis estate, called himself, and was named by others, De Duglas;" and\r\nhe refers to the deeds in which he is so designed. Mr. Chalmers\' full\r\nargument may be found in the first volume of his Caledonia, p. 579.\r\n\r\nThis proposition is one which a Scotsman will admit unwillingly, and\r\nonly upon undeniable testimony: and as it is liable to strong grounds\r\nof challenge, the present author, with all the respect to Mr. Chalmers\r\nwhich his zealous and effectual researches merit, is not unwilling to\r\ntake this opportunity to state some plausible grounds for doubting that\r\nTheobaldus Flammaticus was either the father of the first William de\r\nDouglas, or in the slightest degree connected with the Douglas family.\r\n\r\nIt must first be observed, that there is no reason whatever for\r\nconcluding Theobaldus Flammaticus to be the father of William de\r\nDouglas, except that they both held lands upon the small river of\r\nDouglas; and that there are two strong presumptions to the contrary.\r\nFor, first, the father being named Fleming, there seems no good reason\r\nwhy the son should have assumed a different designation: secondly, there\r\ndoes not occur a single instance of the name of Theobald during the long\r\nline of the Douglas pedigree, an omission very unlikely to take place\r\nhad the original father of the race been so called. These are secondary\r\nconsiderations indeed; but they are important, in so far as they exclude\r\nany support of Mr. Chalmers\' system, except from the point which he has\r\nrather assumed than proved, namely, that the lands granted to Theobald\r\nthe Fleming were the same which were granted to William de Douglas, and\r\nwhich constituted the original domain of which we find this powerful\r\nfamily lords.\r\n\r\nNow, it happens, singularly enough, that the lands granted by the Abbot\r\nof Kelso to Theobaldus Flammaticus are not the same of which William\r\nde Douglas was in possession. Nay, it would appear, from comparing the\r\ncharter granted to Theobaldus Flammaticus, that, though situated on the\r\nwater of Douglas, they never made a part of the barony of that name, and\r\ntherefore cannot be the same with those held by William de Douglas in\r\nthe succeeding generation. But if William de Douglas did not succeed\r\nTheobaldus Flammaticus, there is no more reason for holding these\r\ntwo persons to be father and son than if they had lived in different\r\nprovinces; and we are still as far from having discovered the first mean\r\nman of the Douglas family as Hume of Godscroft was in the 16th century.\r\nWe leave the question to antiquaries and genealogists.]\r\n\r\nIn the earliest of our Scottish annals, the Black Douglas was powerful\r\nand distinguished as now."\r\n\r\n"I bend to the honours of the house of Douglas," said Murray, somewhat\r\nironically; "I am conscious we of the Royal House have little right\r\nto compete with them in dignity--What though we have worn crowns and\r\ncarried sceptres for a few generations, if our genealogy moves no\r\nfarther back than to the humble _Alanus Dapifer!"_\r\n\r\n[Footnote: To atone to the memory of the learned and indefatigable\r\nChalmers for having ventured to impeach his genealogical proposition\r\nconcerning the descent of the Douglasses, we are bound to render him our\r\ngrateful thanks for the felicitous light which he has thrown on that of\r\nthe House of Stewart, still more important to Scottish history.\r\n\r\nThe acute pen of Lord Hailes, which, like the spear of Ithuriel,\r\nconjured so many shadows from Scottish history, had dismissed among the\r\nrest those of Banquo and Fleance, the rejection of which fables left the\r\nillustrious family of Stewart without an ancestor beyond Walter the\r\nson of Allan, who is alluded to in the text. The researches of our late\r\nlearned antiquary detected in this Walter, the descendant of Allan, the\r\nson of Flaald, who obtained from William the Conqueror the Castle of\r\nOswestry in Shropshire, and was the father of an illustrious line\r\nof English nobles, by his first son, William, and by his second son,\r\nWalter, the progenitor of the royal family of Stewart.]\r\n\r\nMorton\'s cheek reddened as he was about to reply; but Henry Warden\r\navailed himself of the liberty which the Protestant clergy long\r\npossessed, and exerted it to interrupt a discussion which was becoming\r\ntoo eager and personal to be friendly.\r\n\r\n"My lords," he said, "I must be bold in discharging the duty of my\r\nMaster. It is a shame and scandal to hear two nobles, whose hands have\r\nbeen so forward in the work of reformation, fall into discord about such\r\nvain follies as now occupy your thoughts. Bethink you how long you have\r\nthought with one mind, seen with one eye, heard with one ear, confirmed\r\nby your union the congregation of the Church, appalled by your joint\r\nauthority the congregation of Anti-Christ; and will you now fall into\r\ndiscord, about an old decayed castle and a few barren hills, about the\r\nloves and likings of an humble spearman, and a damsel bred in the same\r\nobscurity, or about the still vainer questions of idle genealogy?"\r\n\r\n"The good man hath spoken right, noble Douglas," said Murray, reaching\r\nhim his hand, "our union is too essential to the good cause to be\r\nbroken off upon such idle terms of dissension. I am fixed to gratify\r\nGlendinning in this matter--my promise is passed. The wars, in which I\r\nhave had my share, have made many a family miserable; I will at least\r\ntry if I may not make one happy. There are maids and manors enow in\r\nScotland.--I promise you, my noble ally, that young Bennygask shall be\r\nrichly wived."\r\n\r\n"My lord," said Warden, "you speak nobly, and like a Christian. Alas!\r\nthis is a land of hatred and bloodshed--let us not chase from thence\r\nthe few traces that remain of gentle and domestic love.--And be not\r\ntoo eager for wealth to thy noble kinsman, my Lord of Morton, seeing\r\ncontentment in the marriage state no way depends on it."\r\n\r\n"If you allude to my family misfortune," said Morton, whose Countess,\r\nwedded by him for her estate and honours, was insane in her mind, "the\r\nhabit you wear, and the liberty, or rather license, of your profession,\r\nprotect you from my resentment."\r\n\r\n"Alas! my lord," replied Warden, "how quick and sensitive is our\r\nself-love! When pressing forward in our high calling, we point out the\r\nerrors of the Sovereign, who praises our boldness more than the noble\r\nMorton? But touch we upon his own sore, which most needs lancing, and he\r\nshrinks from the faithful chirurgeon in fear and impatient anger!"\r\n\r\n"Enough of this, good and reverend sir," said Murray; "you transgress\r\nthe prudence yourself recommended even now.--We are now close upon the\r\nvillage, and the proud Abbot is come forth at the head of his hive. Thou\r\nhast pleaded well for him, Warden, otherwise I had taken this occasion\r\nto pull down the nest, and chase away the rooks."\r\n\r\n"Nay, but do not so," said Warden; "this William Allan, whom they call\r\nthe Abbot Eustatius, is a man whose misfortunes would more prejudice our\r\ncause than his prosperity. You cannot inflict more than he will endure;\r\nand the more that he is made to bear, the higher will be the influence\r\nof his talents and his courage. In his conventual throne he will be but\r\ncoldly looked on--disliked, it may be, and envied. But turn his crucifix\r\nof gold into a crucifix of wood--let him travel through the land, an\r\noppressed and impoverished man, and his patience, his eloquence, and\r\nlearning, will win more hearts from the good cause, than all the mitred\r\nabbots of Scotland have been able to make prey of during the last\r\nhundred years."\r\n\r\n"Tush! tush! man," said Morton, "the revenues of the Halidome will\r\nbring more men, spears, and horses, into the field in one day, than\r\nhis preaching in a whole lifetime. These are not the days of Peter the\r\nHermit, when monks could march armies from England to Jerusalem; but\r\ngold and good deeds will still do as much or more than ever. Had Julian\r\nAvenel had but a score or two more men this morning, Sir John Foster had\r\nnot missed a worse welcome. I say, confiscating the monk\'s revenues is\r\ndrawing his fang-teeth."\r\n\r\n"We will surely lay him under contribution," said Murray; "and,\r\nmoreover, if he desires to remain in his Abbey, he will do well to\r\nproduce Piercie Shafton."\r\n\r\nAs he thus spoke, they entered the market-place, distinguished by their\r\ncomplete armour and their lofty plumes, as well as by the number of\r\nfollowers bearing their colours and badges. Both these powerful nobles,\r\nbut more especially Murray, so nearly allied to the crown, had at that\r\ntime a retinue and household not much inferior to that of Scottish\r\nroyalty. As they advanced into the market-place, a pursuivant, pressing\r\nforward from their train, addressed the monks in these words:--"The\r\nAbbot of Saint Mary\'s is commanded to appear before the Earl of Murray."\r\n\r\n"The Abbot of Saint Mary\'s," said Eustace, "is, in the patrimony of his\r\nConvent, superior to every temporal lord. Let the Earl of Murray, if he\r\nseeks him, come himself to his presence."\r\n\r\nOn receiving this answer, Murray smiled scornfully, and, dismounting\r\nfrom his lofty saddle, he advanced, accompanied by Morton, and followed\r\nby others, to the body of monks assembled around the cross. There was an\r\nappearance of shrinking among them at the approach of the heretic lord,\r\nso dreaded and so powerful. But the Abbot, casting on them a glance\r\nof rebuke and encouragement, stepped forth from their ranks like\r\na courageous leader, when he sees that his personal valour must be\r\ndisplayed to revive the drooping courage of his followers. "Lord\r\nJames Stewart," he said, "or Earl of Murray, if that be thy title, I,\r\nEustatius, Abbot of Saint Mary\'s, demand by what right you have filled\r\nour peaceful village, and surrounded our brethren, with these bands\r\nof armed men? If hospitality is sought, we have never refused it to\r\ncourteous asking--if violence be meant against peaceful churchmen, let\r\nus know at once the pretext and the object?"\r\n\r\n"Sir Abbot," said Murray, "your language would better have become\r\nanother age, and a presence inferior to ours. We come not here to reply\r\nto your interrogations, but to demand of you why you have broken the\r\npeace, collecting your vassals in arms, and convocating the Queen\'s\r\nlieges, whereby many men have been slain, and much trouble, perchance\r\nbreach of amity with England, is likely to arise?"\r\n\r\n"_Lupus in fabula_," answered the Abbot, scornfully. "The wolf accused\r\nthe sheep of muddying the stream when he drank in it above her--but it\r\nserved as a pretext for devouring her. Convocate the Queen\'s lieges! I\r\ndid so to defend the Queen\'s land against foreigners. I did but my duty;\r\nand I regret I had not the means to do it more effectually."\r\n\r\n"And was it also a part of your duty to receive and harbour the Queen\r\nof England\'s rebel and traitor; and to inflame a war betwixt England and\r\nScotland?" said Murray.\r\n\r\n"In my younger days, my lord," answered the Abbot, with the same\r\nintrepidity, "a war with England was no such dreaded matter; and not\r\nmerely a mitred abbot, bound by his rule to show hospitality and afford\r\nsanctuary to all, but the poorest Scottish peasant, would have been\r\nashamed to have pleaded fear of England as the reason for shutting his\r\ndoor against a persecuted exile. But in those olden days, the English\r\nseldom saw the face of a Scottish nobleman, save through the bars of his\r\nvisor."\r\n\r\n"Monk!" said the Earl of Morton, sternly, "this insolence will little\r\navail thee; the days are gone by when Rome\'s priests were permitted to\r\nbrave noblemen with impunity. Give us up this Piercie Shafton, or by my\r\nfather\'s crest I will set thy Abbey in a bright flame!"\r\n\r\n"And if thou dost, Lord of Morton, its ruins will tumble above the tombs\r\nof thine own ancestors. Be the issue as God wills, the Abbot of Saint\r\nMary\'s gives up no one whom he hath promised to protect."\r\n\r\n"Abbot!" said Murray, "bethink thee ere we are driven to deal\r\nroughly--the hands of these men," he said, pointing to the soldiers,\r\n"will make wild work among shrines and cells, if we are compelled to\r\nundertake a search for this Englishman."\r\n\r\n"Ye shall not need," said a voice from the crowd; and, advancing\r\ngracefully before the Earls, the Euphuist flung from him the mantle in\r\nwhich he was muffled. "Via the cloud that shadowed Shafton!" said he;\r\n"behold, my lords, the Knight of Wilverton, who spares you the guilt of\r\nviolence and sacrilege."\r\n\r\n"I protest before God and man against any infraction of the privileges\r\nof this house," said the Abbot, "by an attempt to impose violent hands\r\nupon the person of this noble knight. If there be yet spirit in a\r\nScottish Parliament, we will make you hear of this elsewhere, my lords!"\r\n\r\n"Spare your threats," said Murray; "it may be, my purpose with\r\nSir Piercie Shafton is not such as thou dost suppose--Attach him,\r\npursuivant, as our prisoner, rescue or no rescue."\r\n\r\n"I yield myself," said the Euphuist, "reserving my right to defy my Lord\r\nof Murray and my Lord of Morton to single duel, even as one gentleman\r\nmay demand satisfaction of another."\r\n\r\n"You shall not want those who will answer your challenge, Sir Knight,"\r\nreplied Morton, "without aspiring to men above thine own degree."\r\n\r\n"And where am I to find these superlative champions," said the English\r\nknight, "whose blood runs more pure than that of Piercie Shafton?"\r\n\r\n"Here is a flight for you, my lord!" said Murray.\r\n\r\n"As ever was flown by a wild-goose," said Stawarth Bolton, who had now\r\napproached to the front of the party.\r\n\r\n"Who dared to say that word?" said the Euphuist, his face crimson with\r\nrage.\r\n\r\n"Tut! man," said Bolton, "make the best of it, thy mother\'s father was\r\nbut a tailor, old Overstitch of Holderness--Why, what! because thou art\r\na misproud bird, and despiseth thine own natural lineage, and rufflest\r\nin unpaid silks and velvets, and keepest company with gallants and\r\ncutters, must we lose our memory for that? Thy mother, Moll Overstitch,\r\nwas the prettiest wench in those parts--she was wedded by wild Shafton\r\nof Wilverton, who men say, was akin to the Piercie on the wrong side of\r\nthe blanket."\r\n\r\n"Help the knight to some strong waters," said Morton; "he hath fallen\r\nfrom such a height, that he is stunned with the tumble."\r\n\r\nIn fact, Sir Piercie Shafton looked like a man stricken by a\r\nthunderbolt, while, notwithstanding the seriousness of the scene\r\nhitherto, no one of those present, not even the Abbot himself, could\r\nrefrain from laughing at the rueful and mortified expression of his\r\nface.\r\n\r\n"Laugh on," he said at length, "laugh on, my masters," shrugging his\r\nshoulders; "it is not for me to be offended--yet would I know full fain\r\nfrom that squire who is laughing with the loudest, how he had discovered\r\nthis unhappy blot in an otherwise spotless lineage, and for what purpose\r\nhe hath made it known?"\r\n\r\n"_I_ make it known?" said Halbert Glendinning, in astonishment,--for to\r\nhim this pathetic appeal was made,--"I never heard the thing till this\r\nmoment."\r\n\r\n[Footnote: The contrivance of provoking the irritable vanity of Sir\r\nPiercie Shafton, by presenting him with a bodkin, indicative of his\r\ndescent from a tailor, is borrowed from a German romance, by the\r\ncelebrated Tieck, called Das Peter Manchem, _i. e._ The Dwarf Peter. The\r\nbeing who gives name to the tale, is the Burg-geist, or castle spectre,\r\nof a German family, whom he aids with his counsel, as he defends their\r\ncastle by his supernatural power. But the Dwarf Peter is so unfortunate\r\nan adviser, that all his counsels, though producing success in the\r\nimmediate results, are in the issue attended with mishap and with guilt.\r\nThe youthful baron, the owner of the haunted castle, falls in love with\r\na maiden, the daughter of a neighbouring count, a man of great pride,\r\nwho refuses him the hand of the young lady, on account of his own\r\nsuperiority of descent. The lover, repulsed and affronted, returns to\r\ntake counsel with the Dwarf Peter, how he may silence the count, and\r\nobtain the victory in the argument, the next time they enter on the\r\ntopic of pedigree. The dwarf gives his patron or pupil a horse-shoe,\r\ninstructing him to give it to the count when he is next giving\r\nhimself superior airs on the subject of his family. It has the effect\r\naccordingly. The count, understanding it as an allusion to a misalliance\r\nof one of his ancestors with the daughter of a blacksmith, is thrown\r\ninto a dreadful passion with the young lover, the consequences of which\r\nare the seduction of the young lady, and the slaughter of her father.\r\n\r\nIf we suppose the dwarf to represent the corrupt part of human\r\nnature,--that "law in our members which wars against the law of our\r\nminds,"--the work forms an ingenious allegory.]\r\n\r\n"Why, did not that old rude soldier learn it from thee?" said the\r\nknight, in increasing amazement.\r\n\r\n"Not I, by Heaven!" said Bolton; "I never saw the youth in my life\r\nbefore."\r\n\r\n"But you _have_ seen him ere now, my worthy master," said Dame\r\nGlendinning, bursting in her turn from the crowd. "My son, this is\r\nStawarth Bolton, he to whom we owe life, and the means of preserving\r\nit--if he be a prisoner, as seems most likely, use thine interest with\r\nthese noble lords to be kind to the widow\'s friend."\r\n\r\n"What, my Dame of the Glen!" said Bolton, "thy brow is more withered, as\r\nwell as mine, since we met last, but thy tongue holds the touch better\r\nthan my arm. This boy of thine gave me the foil sorely this morning. The\r\nBrown Varlet has turned as stout a trooper as I prophesied; and where is\r\nWhite Head?"\r\n\r\n"Alas!" said the mother, looking down, "Edward has taken orders, and\r\nbecome a monk of this Abbey."\r\n\r\n"A monk and a soldier!--Evil trades both, my good dame. Better have\r\nmade one a good master fashioner, like old Overstitch, of Holderness. I\r\nsighed when I envied you the two bonny children, but I sigh not now to\r\ncall either the monk or the soldier mine own. The soldier dies in the\r\nfield, the monk scarce lives in the cloister."\r\n\r\n"My dearest mother," said Halbert, "where is Edward--can I not speak\r\nwith him?"\r\n\r\n"He has just left us for the present," said Father Philip, "upon a\r\nmessage from the Lord Abbot."\r\n\r\n"And Mary, my dearest mother?" said Halbert.--Mary Avenel was not far\r\ndistant, and the three were soon withdrawn from the crowd, to hear and\r\nrelate their various chances of fortune.\r\n\r\nWhile the subordinate personages thus disposed of themselves, the Abbot\r\nheld serious discussion with the two Earls, and, partly yielding to\r\ntheir demands, partly defending himself with skill and eloquence,\r\nwas enabled to make a composition for his Convent, which left it\r\nprovisionally in no worse situation than before. The Earls were the more\r\nreluctant to drive matters to extremity, since he protested, that if\r\nurged beyond what his conscience would comply with, he would throw the\r\nwhole lands of the Monastery into the Queen of Scotland\'s hands, to be\r\ndisposed of at her pleasure. This would not have answered the views of\r\nthe Earls, who were contented, for the time, with a moderate sacrifice\r\nof money and lands. Matters being so far settled, the Abbot became\r\nanxious for the fate of Sir Piercie Shafton, and implored mercy in his\r\nbehalf.\r\n\r\n"He is a coxcomb," he said, "my lords, but he is a generous, though a\r\nvain fool; and it is my firm belief you have this day done him more pain\r\nthan if you had run a poniard into him."\r\n\r\n"Run a needle into him you mean, Abbot," said the Earl of Morton; "by\r\nmine honour, I thought this grandson of a fashioner of doublets was\r\ndescended from a crowned head at least!"\r\n\r\n"I hold with the Abbot," said Murray; "there were little honour in\r\nsurrendering him to Elizabeth, but he shall be sent where he can do her\r\nno injury. Our pursuivant and Bolton shall escort him to Dunbar, and\r\nship him off for Flanders.--But soft, here he comes, and leading a\r\nfemale, as I think."\r\n\r\n"Lords and others," said the English knight with great solemnity, "make\r\nway for the Lady of Piercie Shafton--a secret which I listed not to make\r\nknown, till fate, which hath betrayed what I vainly strove to conceal,\r\nmakes me less desirous to hide that which I now announce to you."\r\n\r\n"It is Mysie Happer, the Miller\'s daughter, on my life!" said Tibb\r\nTacket. "I thought the pride of these Piercies would have a fa\'."\r\n\r\n"It is indeed the lovely Mysinda," said the knight, "whose merits\r\ntowards her devoted servant deserved higher rank than he had to bestow."\r\n\r\n"I suspect, though," said Murray, "that we should not have heard of the\r\nMiller\'s daughter being made a lady, had not the knight proved to be the\r\ngrandson of a tailor."\r\n\r\n"My lord," said Piercie Shafton, "it is poor valour to strike him\r\nthat cannot smite again; and I hope you will consider what is due to\r\na prisoner by the law of arms, and say nothing more on this odious\r\nsubject. When I am once more mine own man, I will find a new road to\r\ndignity."\r\n\r\n"_Shape_ one, I presume," said the Earl of Morton.\r\n\r\n"Nay, Douglas, you will drive him mad,"--said Murray; "besides, we\r\nhave other matter in hand--I must see Warden wed Glendinning with Mary\r\nAvenel, and put him in possession of his wife\'s castle without delay. It\r\nwill be best done ere our forces leave these parts."\r\n\r\n"And I," said the Miller, "have the like grist to grind; for I hope some\r\none of the good fathers will wed my wench with her gay bridegroom."\r\n\r\n"It needs not," said Shafton; "the ceremonial hath been solemnly\r\nperformed."\r\n\r\n"It will not be the worse of another bolting," said the Miller; "it is\r\nalways best to be sure, as I say when I chance to take multure twice\r\nfrom the same meal-sack."\r\n\r\n"Stave the miller off him," said Murray, "or he will worry him dead.\r\nThe Abbot, my lord, offers us the hospitality of the Convent; I move we\r\nshould repair hither, Sir Piercie and all of us. I must learn to know\r\nthe Maid of Avenel--to-morrow I must act as her father--All Scotland\r\nshall see how Murray can reward a faithful servant."\r\n\r\nMary Avenel and her lover avoided meeting the Abbot, and took up their\r\ntemporary abode in a house of the village, where next day their hands\r\nwere united by the Protestant preacher in presence of the two Earls.\r\nOn the same day Piercie Shafton and his bride departed, under an escort\r\nwhich was to conduct him to the sea-side, and see him embark for the Low\r\nCountries. Early on the following morning the bands of the Earls were\r\nunder march to the Castle of Avenel, to invest the young bridegroom\r\nwith the property of his wife, which was surrendered to them without\r\nopposition.\r\n\r\nBut not without those omens which seemed to mark every remarkable event\r\nwhich befell the fated family, did Mary take possession of the ancient\r\ncastle of her forefathers. The same warlike form which had appeared more\r\nthan once at Glendearg, was seen by Tibb Tacket and Martin, who returned\r\nwith their young mistress to partake her altered fortunes. It glided\r\nbefore the cavalcade as they advanced upon the long causeway, paused\r\nat each drawbridge, and flourished its hand, as in triumph, as it\r\ndisappeared under the gloomy archway, which was surmounted by the\r\ninsignia of the house of Avenel. The two trusty servants made their\r\nvision only known to Dame Glendinning, who, with much pride of heart,\r\nhad accompanied her son to see him take his rank among the barons of the\r\nland. "Oh, my dear bairn!" she exclaimed, when she heard the tale, "the\r\ncastle is a grand place to be sure, but I wish ye dinna a\' desire to be\r\nback in the quiet braes of Glendearg before the play be played out."\r\nBut this natural reflection, springing from maternal anxiety, was soon\r\nforgotten amid the busy and pleasing task of examining and admiring the\r\nnew habitation of her son.\r\n\r\nWhile these affairs were passing, Edward had hidden himself and his\r\nsorrows in the paternal Tower of Glendearg, where every object was full\r\nof matter for bitter reflection. The Abbot\'s kindness had despatched him\r\nthither upon pretence of placing some papers belonging to the Abbey in\r\nsafety and secrecy; but in reality to prevent his witnessing the triumph\r\nof his brother. Through the deserted apartments, the scene of so many\r\nbitter reflections, the unhappy youth stalked like a discontented ghost,\r\nconjuring up around him at every step new subjects for sorrow and for\r\nself-torment. Impatient, at length, of the state of irritation and\r\nagonized recollection in which he found himself, he rushed out and\r\nwalked hastily up the glen, as if to shake off the load which hung\r\nupon his mind. The sun was setting when he reached the entrance of\r\nCorri-nan-shian, and the recollection of what he had seen when he last\r\nvisited that haunted ravine, burst on his mind. He was in a humour,\r\nhowever, rather to seek out danger than to avoid it.\r\n\r\n"I will face this mystic being," he said; "she foretold the fate which\r\nhas wrapt me in this dress,--I will know whether she has aught else to\r\ntell me of a life which cannot but be miserable."\r\n\r\nHe failed not to see the White Spirit seated by her accustomed haunt,\r\nand singing in her usual low and sweet tone. While she sung, she seemed\r\nto look with sorrow on her golden zone, which was now diminished to the\r\nfineness of a silken thread.\r\n\r\n  "Fare thee well, thou Holly green,\r\n  Thou shall seldom now be seen,\r\n  With all thy glittering garlands bending,\r\n  As to greet my slow descending,\r\n  Startling the bewilder\'d hind.\r\n  Who sees thee wave without a wind.\r\n\r\n  "Farewell, Fountain! now not long\r\n  Shalt thou murmur to my song,\r\n  While thy crystal bubbles glancing,\r\n  Keep the time in mystic dancing,\r\n  Rise and swell, are burst and lost,\r\n  Like mortal schemes by fortune crost.\r\n\r\n  "The knot of fate at length is tied,\r\n  The Churl is Lord, the Maid is bride.\r\n  Vainly did my magic sleight\r\n  Send the lover from her sight;\r\n  Wither bush, and perish well,\r\n  Fall\'n is lofty Avenel!"\r\n\r\nThe vision seemed to weep while she sung; and the words impressed on\r\nEdward a melancholy belief, that the alliance of Mary with his brother\r\nmight be fatal to them both.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHere terminates the First Part of the Benedictine\'s Manuscript. I have\r\nin vain endeavoured to ascertain the precise period of the story, as\r\nthe dates cannot be exactly reconciled with those of the most accredited\r\nhistories. But it is astonishing how careless the writers of Utopia are\r\nupon these important subjects. I observe that the learned Mr. Laurence\r\nTempleton, in his late publication entitled IVANHOE, has not only\r\nblessed the bed of Edward the Confessor with an offspring unknown to\r\nhistory, with sundry other solecisms of the same kind, but has inverted\r\nthe order of nature, and feasted his swine with acorns in the midst of\r\nsummer. All that can be alleged by the warmest admirer of this author\r\namounts to this,--that the circumstances objected to are just as true\r\nas the rest of the story; which appears to me (more especially in the\r\nmatter of the acorns) to be a very imperfect defence, and that the\r\nauthor will do well to profit by Captain Absolute\'s advice to his\r\nservant, and never tell him more lies than are indispensably necessary.\r\n\r\n                End of THE MONASTERY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Monastery, by Sir Walter Scott\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE MONASTERY ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 6406.txt or 6406.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/6/4/0/6406/\r\n\r\nProduced by Alan Millar, David Moynihan, Charles Franks\r\nand the Online Distributed Proofreading Team\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n'
