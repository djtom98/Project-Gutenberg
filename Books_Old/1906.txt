This is a mistake, though a perfectly natural\r\none.  The fact is that "Erewhon" was finished, with the exception of the\r\nlast twenty pages and a sentence or two inserted from time to time here\r\nand there throughout the book, before the first advertisement of "The\r\nComing Race" appeared.  A friend having called my attention to one of the\r\nfirst of these advertisements, and suggesting that it probably referred\r\nto a work of similar character to my own, I took "Erewhon" to a\r\nwell-known firm of publishers on the 1st of May 1871, and left it in\r\ntheir hands for consideration.  I then went abroad, and on learning that\r\nthe publishers alluded to declined the MS., I let it alone for six or\r\nseven months, and, being in an out-of-the-way part of Italy, never saw a\r\nsingle review of "The Coming Race," nor a copy of the work.  On my\r\nreturn, I purposely avoided looking into it until I had sent back my last\r\nrevises to the printer.  Then I had much pleasure in reading it, but was\r\nindeed surprised at the many little points of similarity between the two\r\nbooks, in spite of their entire independence to one another.\r\n\r\nI regret that reviewers have in some cases been inclined to treat the\r\nchapters on Machines as an attempt to reduce Mr. Darwin\'s theory to an\r\nabsurdity.   Nothing could be further from my intention, and few things\r\nwould be more distasteful to me than any attempt to laugh at Mr. Darwin;\r\nbut I must own that I have myself to thank for the misconception, for I\r\nfelt sure that my intention would be missed, but preferred not to weaken\r\nthe chapters by explanation, and knew very well that Mr. Darwin\'s theory\r\nwould take no harm.  The only question in my mind was how far I could\r\nafford to be misrepresented as laughing at that for which I have the most\r\nprofound admiration.  I am surprised, however, that the book at which\r\nsuch an example of the specious misuse of analogy would seem most\r\nnaturally levelled should have occurred to no reviewer; neither shall I\r\nmention the name of the book here, though I should fancy that the hint\r\ngiven will suffice.\r\n\r\nI have been held by some whose opinions I respect to have denied men\'s\r\nresponsibility for their actions.   He who does this is an enemy who\r\ndeserves no quarter.  I should have imagined that I had been sufficiently\r\nexplicit, but have made a few additions to the chapter on Malcontents,\r\nwhich will, I think, serve to render further mistake impossible.\r\n\r\nAn anonymous correspondent (by the hand-writing presumably a clergyman)\r\ntells me that in quoting from the Latin grammar I should at any rate have\r\ndone so correctly, and that I should have written "agricolas" instead of\r\n"agricolae".  He added something about any boy in the fourth form, &c.,\r\n&c., which I shall not quote, but which made me very uncomfortable.  It\r\nmay be said that I must have misquoted from design, from ignorance, or by\r\na slip of the pen; but surely in these days it will be recognised as\r\nharsh to assign limits to the all-embracing boundlessness of truth, and\r\nit will be more reasonably assumed that each of the three possible causes\r\nof misquotation must have had its share in the apparent blunder.  The art\r\nof writing things that shall sound right and yet be wrong has made so\r\nmany reputations, and affords comfort to such a large number of readers,\r\nthat I could not venture to neglect it; the Latin grammar, however, is a\r\nsubject on which some of the younger members of the community feel\r\nstrongly, so I have now written "agricolas".  I have also parted with the\r\nword "infortuniam" (though not without regret), but have not dared to\r\nmeddle with other similar inaccuracies.\r\n\r\nFor the inconsistencies in the book, and I am aware that there are not a\r\nfew, I must ask the indulgence of the reader.  The blame, however, lies\r\nchiefly with the Erewhonians themselves, for they were really a very\r\ndifficult people to understand.  The most glaring anomalies seemed to\r\nafford them no intellectual inconvenience; neither, provided they did not\r\nactually see the money dropping out of their pockets, nor suffer\r\nimmediate physical pain, would they listen to any arguments as to the\r\nwaste of money and happiness which their folly caused them.  But this had\r\nan effect of which I have little reason to complain, for I was allowed\r\nalmost to call them life-long self-deceivers to their faces, and they\r\nsaid it was quite true, but that it did not matter.\r\n\r\nI must not conclude without expressing my most sincere thanks to my\r\ncritics and to the public for the leniency and consideration with which\r\nthey have treated my adventures.\r\n\r\nJune 9, 1872\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO THE REVISED EDITION\r\n\r\n\r\nMy publisher wishes me to say a few words about the genesis of the work,\r\na revised and enlarged edition of which he is herewith laying before the\r\npublic.  I therefore place on record as much as I can remember on this\r\nhead after a lapse of more than thirty years.\r\n\r\nThe first part of "Erewhon" written was an article headed "Darwin among\r\nthe Machines," and signed Cellarius.  It was written in the Upper\r\nRangitata district of the Canterbury Province (as it then was) of New\r\nZealand, and appeared at Christchurch in the Press Newspaper, June 13,\r\n1863.  A copy of this article is indexed under my books in the British\r\nMuseum catalogue.  In passing, I may say that the opening chapters of\r\n"Erewhon" were also drawn from the Upper Rangitata district, with such\r\nmodifications as I found convenient.\r\n\r\nA second article on the same subject as the one just referred to appeared\r\nin the Press shortly after the first, but I have no copy.  It treated\r\nMachines from a different point of view, and was the basis of pp. 270-274\r\nof the present edition of "Erewhon." {1} This view ultimately led me to\r\nthe theory I put forward in "Life and Habit," published in November 1877.\r\nI have put a bare outline of this theory (which I believe to be quite\r\nsound) into the mouth of an Erewhonian philosopher in Chapter XXVII. of\r\nthis book.\r\n\r\nIn 1865 I rewrote and enlarged "Darwin among the Machines" for the\r\nReasoner, a paper published in London by Mr. G. J. Holyoake.  It appeared\r\nJuly 1, 1865, under the heading, "The Mechanical Creation," and can be\r\nseen in the British Museum.  I again rewrote and enlarged it, till it\r\nassumed the form in which it appeared in the first edition of "Erewhon."\r\n\r\nThe next part of "Erewhon" that I wrote was the "World of the Unborn," a\r\npreliminary form of which was sent to Mr. Holyoake\'s paper, but as I\r\ncannot find it among those copies of the Reasoner that are in the British\r\nMuseum, I conclude that it was not accepted.  I have, however, rather a\r\nstrong fancy that it appeared in some London paper of the same character\r\nas the Reasoner, not very long after July 1, 1865, but I have no copy.\r\n\r\nI also wrote about this time the substance of what ultimately became the\r\nMusical Banks, and the trial of a man for being in a consumption.  These\r\nfour detached papers were, I believe, all that was written of "Erewhon"\r\nbefore 1870.  Between 1865 and 1870 I wrote hardly anything, being\r\nhopeful of attaining that success as a painter which it has not been\r\nvouchsafed me to attain, but in the autumn of 1870, just as I was\r\nbeginning to get occasionally hung at Royal Academy exhibitions, my\r\nfriend, the late Sir F. N. (then Mr.) Broome, suggested to me that I\r\nshould add somewhat to the articles I had already written, and string\r\nthem together into a book.  I was rather fired by the idea, but as I only\r\nworked at the MS. on Sundays it was some months before I had completed\r\nit.\r\n\r\nI see from my second Preface that I took the book to Messrs. Chapman &\r\nHall May 1, 1871, and on their rejection of it, under the advice of one\r\nwho has attained the highest rank among living writers, I let it sleep,\r\ntill I took it to Mr. Trubner early in 1872.  As regards its rejection by\r\nMessrs. Chapman & Hall, I believe their reader advised them quite wisely.\r\nThey told me he reported that it was a philosophical work, little likely\r\nto be popular with a large circle of readers.  I hope that if I had been\r\ntheir reader, and the book had been submitted to myself, I should have\r\nadvised them to the same effect.\r\n\r\n"Erewhon" appeared with the last day or two of March 1872.  I attribute\r\nits unlooked-for success mainly to two early favourable reviews--the\r\nfirst in the Pall Mall Gazette of April 12, and the second in the\r\nSpectator of April 20.  There was also another cause.  I was complaining\r\nonce to a friend that though "Erewhon" had met with such a warm\r\nreception, my subsequent books had been all of them practically still-\r\nborn.  He said, "You forget one charm that \'Erewhon\' had, but which none\r\nof your other books can have."  I asked what? and was answered, "The\r\nsound of a new voice, and of an unknown voice."\r\n\r\nThe first edition of "Erewhon" sold in about three weeks; I had not taken\r\nmoulds, and as the demand was strong, it was set up again immediately.  I\r\nmade a few unimportant alterations and additions, and added a Preface, of\r\nwhich I cannot say that I am particularly proud, but an inexperienced\r\nwriter with a head somewhat turned by unexpected success is not to be\r\ntrusted with a preface.  I made a few further very trifling alterations\r\nbefore moulds were taken, but since the summer of 1872, as new editions\r\nwere from time to time wanted, they have been printed from stereos then\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nHaving now, I fear, at too great length done what I was asked to do, I\r\nshould like to add a few words on my own account.  I am still fairly well\r\nsatisfied with those parts of "Erewhon" that were repeatedly rewritten,\r\nbut from those that had only a single writing I would gladly cut out some\r\nforty or fifty pages if I could.\r\n\r\nThis, however, may not be, for the copyright will probably expire in a\r\nlittle over twelve years.  It was necessary, therefore, to revise the\r\nbook throughout for literary inelegancies--of which I found many more\r\nthan I had expected--and also to make such substantial additions as\r\nshould secure a new lease of life--at any rate for the copyright.  If,\r\nthen, instead of cutting out, say fifty pages, I have been compelled to\r\nadd about sixty invita Minerva--the blame rests neither with my publisher\r\nnor with me, but with the copyright laws.  Nevertheless I can assure the\r\nreader that, though I have found it an irksome task to take up work which\r\nI thought I had got rid of thirty years ago, and much of which I am\r\nashamed of, I have done my best to make the new matter savour so much of\r\nthe better portions of the old, that none but the best critics shall\r\nperceive at what places the gaps of between thirty and forty years occur.\r\n\r\nLastly, if my readers note a considerable difference between the literary\r\ntechnique of "Erewhon" and that of "Erewhon Revisited," I would remind\r\nthem that, as I have just shown, "Erewhon" look something like ten years\r\nin writing, and even so was written with great difficulty, while "Erewhon\r\nRevisited" was written easily between November 1900 and the end of April\r\n1901.  There is no central idea underlying "Erewhon," whereas the attempt\r\nto realise the effect of a single supposed great miracle dominates the\r\nwhole of its successor.  In "Erewhon" there was hardly any story, and\r\nlittle attempt to give life and individuality to the characters; I hope\r\nthat in "Erewhon Revisited" both these defects have been in great measure\r\navoided.  "Erewhon" was not an organic whole, "Erewhon Revisited" may\r\nfairly claim to be one.  Nevertheless, though in literary workmanship I\r\ndo not doubt that this last-named book is an improvement on the first, I\r\nshall be agreeably surprised if I am not told that "Erewhon," with all\r\nits faults, is the better reading of the two.\r\n\r\nSAMUEL BUTLER.\r\nAugust 7, 1901\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I: WASTE LANDS\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the reader will excuse me, I will say nothing of my antecedents, nor\r\nof the circumstances which led me to leave my native country; the\r\nnarrative would be tedious to him and painful to myself.  Suffice it,\r\nthat when I left home it was with the intention of going to some new\r\ncolony, and either finding, or even perhaps purchasing, waste crown land\r\nsuitable for cattle or sheep farming, by which means I thought that I\r\ncould better my fortunes more rapidly than in England.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that I did not succeed in my design, and that however\r\nmuch I may have met with that was new and strange, I have been unable to\r\nreap any pecuniary advantage.\r\n\r\nIt is true, I imagine myself to have made a discovery which, if I can be\r\nthe first to profit by it, will bring me a recompense beyond all money\r\ncomputation, and secure me a position such as has not been attained by\r\nmore than some fifteen or sixteen persons, since the creation of the\r\nuniverse.  But to this end I must possess myself of a considerable sum of\r\nmoney: neither do I know how to get it, except by interesting the public\r\nin my story, and inducing the charitable to come forward and assist me.\r\nWith this hope I now publish my adventures; but I do so with great\r\nreluctance, for I fear that my story will be doubted unless I tell the\r\nwhole of it; and yet I dare not do so, lest others with more means than\r\nmine should get the start of me.  I prefer the risk of being doubted to\r\nthat of being anticipated, and have therefore concealed my destination on\r\nleaving England, as also the point from which I began my more serious and\r\ndifficult journey.\r\n\r\nMy chief consolation lies in the fact that truth bears its own impress,\r\nand that my story will carry conviction by reason of the internal\r\nevidences for its accuracy.  No one who is himself honest will doubt my\r\nbeing so.\r\n\r\nI reached my destination in one of the last months of 1868, but I dare\r\nnot mention the season, lest the reader should gather in which hemisphere\r\nI was.  The colony was one which had not been opened up even to the most\r\nadventurous settlers for more than eight or nine years, having been\r\npreviously uninhabited, save by a few tribes of savages who frequented\r\nthe seaboard.  The part known to Europeans consisted of a coast-line\r\nabout eight hundred miles in length (affording three or four good\r\nharbours), and a tract of country extending inland for a space varying\r\nfrom two to three hundred miles, until it a reached the offshoots of an\r\nexceedingly lofty range of mountains, which could be seen from far out\r\nupon the plains, and were covered with perpetual snow.  The coast was\r\nperfectly well known both north and south of the tract to which I have\r\nalluded, but in neither direction was there a single harbour for five\r\nhundred miles, and the mountains, which descended almost into the sea,\r\nwere covered with thick timber, so that none would think of settling.\r\n\r\nWith this bay of land, however, the case was different.  The harbours\r\nwere sufficient; the country was timbered, but not too heavily; it was\r\nadmirably suited for agriculture; it also contained millions on millions\r\nof acres of the most beautifully grassed country in the world, and of the\r\nbest suited for all manner of sheep and cattle.  The climate was\r\ntemperate, and very healthy; there were no wild animals, nor were the\r\nnatives dangerous, being few in number and of an intelligent tractable\r\ndisposition.\r\n\r\nIt may be readily understood that when once Europeans set foot upon this\r\nterritory they were not slow to take advantage of its capabilities.  Sheep\r\nand cattle were introduced, and bred with extreme rapidity; men took up\r\ntheir 50,000 or 100,000 acres of country, going inland one behind the\r\nother, till in a few years there was not an acre between the sea and the\r\nfront ranges which was not taken up, and stations either for sheep or\r\ncattle were spotted about at intervals of some twenty or thirty miles\r\nover the whole country.  The front ranges stopped the tide of squatters\r\nfor some little time; it was thought that there was too much snow upon\r\nthem for too many months in the year,--that the sheep would get lost, the\r\nground being too difficult for shepherding,--that the expense of getting\r\nwool down to the ship\'s side would eat up the farmer\'s profits,--and that\r\nthe grass was too rough and sour for sheep to thrive upon; but one after\r\nanother determined to try the experiment, and it was wonderful how\r\nsuccessfully it turned out.  Men pushed farther and farther into the\r\nmountains, and found a very considerable tract inside the front range,\r\nbetween it and another which was loftier still, though even this was not\r\nthe highest, the great snowy one which could be seen from out upon the\r\nplains.  This second range, however, seemed to mark the extreme limits of\r\npastoral country; and it was here, at a small and newly founded station,\r\nthat I was received as a cadet, and soon regularly employed.  I was then\r\njust twenty-two years old.\r\n\r\nI was delighted with the country and the manner of life.  It was my daily\r\nbusiness to go up to the top of a certain high mountain, and down one of\r\nits spurs on to the flat, in order to make sure that no sheep had crossed\r\ntheir boundaries.  I was to see the sheep, not necessarily close at hand,\r\nnor to get them in a single mob, but to see enough of them here and there\r\nto feel easy that nothing had gone wrong; this was no difficult matter,\r\nfor there were not above eight hundred of them; and, being all breeding\r\newes, they were pretty quiet.\r\n\r\nThere were a good many sheep which I knew, as two or three black ewes,\r\nand a black lamb or two, and several others which had some distinguishing\r\nmark whereby I could tell them.  I would try and see all these, and if\r\nthey were all there, and the mob looked large enough, I might rest\r\nassured that all was well.  It is surprising how soon the eye becomes\r\naccustomed to missing twenty sheep out of two or three hundred.  I had a\r\ntelescope and a dog, and would take bread and meat and tobacco with me.\r\nStarting with early dawn, it would be night before I could complete my\r\nround; for the mountain over which I had to go was very high.  In winter\r\nit was covered with snow, and the sheep needed no watching from above.  If\r\nI were to see sheep dung or tracks going down on to the other side of the\r\nmountain (where there was a valley with a stream--a mere _cul de sac_), I\r\nwas to follow them, and look out for sheep; but I never saw any, the\r\nsheep always descending on to their own side, partly from habit, and\r\npartly because there was abundance of good sweet feed, which had been\r\nburnt in the early spring, just before I came, and was now deliciously\r\ngreen and rich, while that on the other side had never been burnt, and\r\nwas rank and coarse.\r\n\r\nIt was a monotonous life, but it was very healthy and one does not much\r\nmind anything when one is well.  The country was the grandest that can be\r\nimagined.  How often have I sat on the mountain side and watched the\r\nwaving downs, with the two white specks of huts in the distance, and the\r\nlittle square of garden behind them; the paddock with a patch of bright\r\ngreen oats above the huts, and the yards and wool-sheds down on the flat\r\nbelow; all seen as through the wrong end of a telescope, so clear and\r\nbrilliant was the air, or as upon a colossal model or map spread out\r\nbeneath me.  Beyond the downs was a plain, going down to a river of great\r\nsize, on the farther side of which there were other high mountains, with\r\nthe winter\'s snow still not quite melted; up the river, which ran winding\r\nin many streams over a bed some two miles broad, I looked upon the second\r\ngreat chain, and could see a narrow gorge where the river retired and was\r\nlost.  I knew that there was a range still farther back; but except from\r\none place near the very top of my own mountain, no part of it was\r\nvisible: from this point, however, I saw, whenever there were no clouds,\r\na single snow-clad peak, many miles away, and I should think about as\r\nhigh as any mountain in the world.  Never shall I forget the utter\r\nloneliness of the prospect--only the little far-away homestead giving\r\nsign of human handiwork;--the vastness of mountain and plain, of river\r\nand sky; the marvellous atmospheric effects--sometimes black mountains\r\nagainst a white sky, and then again, after cold weather, white mountains\r\nagainst a black sky--sometimes seen through breaks and swirls of\r\ncloud--and sometimes, which was best of all, I went up my mountain in a\r\nfog, and then got above the mist; going higher and higher, I would look\r\ndown upon a sea of whiteness, through which would be thrust innumerable\r\nmountain tops that looked like islands.\r\n\r\nI am there now, as I write; I fancy that I can see the downs, the huts,\r\nthe plain, and the river-bed--that torrent pathway of desolation, with\r\nits distant roar of waters.  Oh, wonderful! wonderful! so lonely and so\r\nsolemn, with the sad grey clouds above, and no sound save a lost lamb\r\nbleating upon the mountain side, as though its little heart were\r\nbreaking.  Then there comes some lean and withered old ewe, with deep\r\ngruff voice and unlovely aspect, trotting back from the seductive\r\npasture; now she examines this gully, and now that, and now she stands\r\nlistening with uplifted head, that she may hear the distant wailing and\r\nobey it.  Aha! they see, and rush towards each other.  Alas! they are\r\nboth mistaken; the ewe is not the lamb\'s ewe, they are neither kin nor\r\nkind to one another, and part in coldness.  Each must cry louder, and\r\nwander farther yet; may luck be with them both that they may find their\r\nown at nightfall.  But this is mere dreaming, and I must proceed.\r\n\r\nI could not help speculating upon what might lie farther up the river and\r\nbehind the second range.  I had no money, but if I could only find\r\nworkable country, I might stock it with borrowed capital, and consider\r\nmyself a made man.  True, the range looked so vast, that there seemed\r\nlittle chance of getting a sufficient road through it or over it; but no\r\none had yet explored it, and it is wonderful how one finds that one can\r\nmake a path into all sorts of places (and even get a road for\r\npack-horses), which from a distance appear inaccessible; the river was so\r\ngreat that it must drain an inner tract--at least I thought so; and\r\nthough every one said it would be madness to attempt taking sheep farther\r\ninland, I knew that only three years ago the same cry had been raised\r\nagainst the country which my master\'s flock was now overrunning.  I could\r\nnot keep these thoughts out of my head as I would rest myself upon the\r\nmountain side; they haunted me as I went my daily rounds, and grew upon\r\nme from hour to hour, till I resolved that after shearing I would remain\r\nin doubt no longer, but saddle my horse, take as much provision with me\r\nas I could, and go and see for myself.\r\n\r\nBut over and above these thoughts came that of the great range itself.\r\nWhat was beyond it?  Ah! who could say?  There was no one in the whole\r\nworld who had the smallest idea, save those who were themselves on the\r\nother side of it--if, indeed, there was any one at all.  Could I hope to\r\ncross it?  This would be the highest triumph that I could wish for; but\r\nit was too much to think of yet.  I would try the nearer range, and see\r\nhow far I could go.  Even if I did not find country, might I not find\r\ngold, or diamonds, or copper, or silver?  I would sometimes lie flat down\r\nto drink out of a stream, and could see little yellow specks among the\r\nsand; were these gold?  People said no; but then people always said there\r\nwas no gold until it was found to be abundant: there was plenty of slate\r\nand granite, which I had always understood to accompany gold; and even\r\nthough it was not found in paying quantities here, it might be abundant\r\nin the main ranges.  These thoughts filled my head, and I could not\r\nbanish them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II: IN THE WOOL-SHED\r\n\r\n\r\nAt last shearing came; and with the shearers there was an old native,\r\nwhom they had nicknamed Chowbok--though, I believe, his real name was\r\nKahabuka.  He was a sort of chief of the natives, could speak a little\r\nEnglish, and was a great favourite with the missionaries.  He did not do\r\nany regular work with the shearers, but pretended to help in the yards,\r\nhis real aim being to get the grog, which is always more freely\r\ncirculated at shearing-time: he did not get much, for he was apt to be\r\ndangerous when drunk; and very little would make him so: still he did get\r\nit occasionally, and if one wanted to get anything out of him, it was the\r\nbest bribe to offer him.  I resolved to question him, and get as much\r\ninformation from him as I could.  I did so.  As long as I kept to\r\nquestions about the nearer ranges, he was easy to get on with--he had\r\nnever been there, but there were traditions among his tribe to the effect\r\nthat there was no sheep-country, nothing, in fact, but stunted timber and\r\na few river-bed flats.  It was very difficult to reach; still there were\r\npasses: one of them up our own river, though not directly along the river-\r\nbed, the gorge of which was not practicable; he had never seen any one\r\nwho had been there: was there not enough on this side?  But when I\r\ncame to the main range, his manner changed at once.  He became uneasy,\r\nand began to prevaricate and shuffle.  In a very few minutes I could see\r\nthat of this too there existed traditions in his tribe; but no efforts or\r\ncoaxing could get a word from him about them.  At last I hinted about\r\ngrog, and presently he feigned consent: I gave it him; but as soon as he\r\nhad drunk it he began shamming intoxication, and then went to sleep, or\r\npretended to do so, letting me kick him pretty hard and never budging.\r\n\r\nI was angry, for I had to go without my own grog and had got nothing out\r\nof him; so the next day I determined that he should tell me before I gave\r\nhim any, or get none at all.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, when night came and the shearers had knocked off work and\r\nhad their supper, I got my share of rum in a tin pannikin and made a sign\r\nto Chowbok to follow me to the wool-shed, which he willingly did,\r\nslipping out after me, and no one taking any notice of either of us.  When\r\nwe got down to the wool-shed we lit a tallow candle, and having stuck it\r\nin an old bottle we sat down upon the wool bales and began to smoke.  A\r\nwool-shed is a roomy place, built somewhat on the same plan as a\r\ncathedral, with aisles on either side full of pens for the sheep, a great\r\nnave, at the upper end of which the shearers work, and a further space\r\nfor wool sorters and packers.  It always refreshed me with a semblance of\r\nantiquity (precious in a new country), though I very well knew that the\r\noldest wool-shed in the settlement was not more than seven years old,\r\nwhile this was only two.  Chowbok pretended to expect his grog at once,\r\nthough we both of us knew very well what the other was after, and that we\r\nwere each playing against the other, the one for grog the other for\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nWe had a hard fight: for more than two hours he had tried to put me off\r\nwith lies but had carried no conviction; during the whole time we had\r\nbeen morally wrestling with one another and had neither of us apparently\r\ngained the least advantage; at length, however, I had become sure that he\r\nwould give in ultimately, and that with a little further patience I\r\nshould get his story out of him.  As upon a cold day in winter, when one\r\nhas churned (as I had often had to do), and churned in vain, and the\r\nbutter makes no sign of coming, at last one tells by the sound that the\r\ncream has gone to sleep, and then upon a sudden the butter comes, so I\r\nhad churned at Chowbok until I perceived that he had arrived, as it were,\r\nat the sleepy stage, and that with a continuance of steady quiet pressure\r\nthe day was mine.  On a sudden, without a word of warning, he rolled two\r\nbales of wool (his strength was very great) into the middle of the floor,\r\nand on the top of these he placed another crosswise; he snatched up an\r\nempty wool-pack, threw it like a mantle over his shoulders, jumped upon\r\nthe uppermost bale, and sat upon it.  In a moment his whole form was\r\nchanged.  His high shoulders dropped; he set his feet close together,\r\nheel to heel and toe to toe; he laid his arms and hands close alongside\r\nof his body, the palms following his thighs; he held his head high but\r\nquite straight, and his eyes stared right in front of him; but he frowned\r\nhorribly, and assumed an expression of face that was positively fiendish.\r\nAt the best of times Chowbok was very ugly, but he now exceeded all\r\nconceivable limits of the hideous.  His mouth extended almost from ear to\r\near, grinning horribly and showing all his teeth; his eyes glared, though\r\nthey remained quite fixed, and his forehead was contracted with a most\r\nmalevolent scowl.\r\n\r\nI am afraid my description will have conveyed only the ridiculous side of\r\nhis appearance; but the ridiculous and the sublime are near, and the\r\ngrotesque fiendishness of Chowbok\'s face approached this last, if it did\r\nnot reach it.  I tried to be amused, but I felt a sort of creeping at the\r\nroots of my hair and over my whole body, as I looked and wondered what he\r\ncould possibly be intending to signify.  He continued thus for about a\r\nminute, sitting bolt upright, as stiff as a stone, and making this\r\nfearful face.  Then there came from his lips a low moaning like the wind,\r\nrising and falling by infinitely small gradations till it became almost a\r\nshriek, from which it descended and died away; after that, he jumped down\r\nfrom the bale and held up the extended fingers of both his hands, as one\r\nwho should say "Ten," though I did not then understand him.\r\n\r\nFor myself I was open-mouthed with astonishment.  Chowbok rolled the\r\nbales rapidly into their place, and stood before me shuddering as in\r\ngreat fear; horror was written upon his face--this time quite\r\ninvoluntarily--as though the natural panic of one who had committed an\r\nawful crime against unknown and superhuman agencies.  He nodded his head\r\nand gibbered, and pointed repeatedly to the mountains.  He would not\r\ntouch the grog, but, after a few seconds he made a run through the wool-\r\nshed door into the moonlight; nor did he reappear till next day at dinner-\r\ntime, when he turned up, looking very sheepish and abject in his civility\r\ntowards myself.\r\n\r\nOf his meaning I had no conception.  How could I?  All I could feel sure\r\nof was, that he had a meaning which was true and awful to himself.  It\r\nwas enough for me that I believed him to have given me the best he had\r\nand all he had.  This kindled my imagination more than if he had told me\r\nintelligible stories by the hour together.  I knew not what the great\r\nsnowy ranges might conceal, but I could no longer doubt that it would be\r\nsomething well worth discovering.\r\n\r\nI kept aloof from Chowbok for the next few days, and showed no desire to\r\nquestion him further; when I spoke to him I called him Kahabuka, which\r\ngratified him greatly: he seemed to have become afraid of me, and acted\r\nas one who was in my power.  Having therefore made up my mind that I\r\nwould begin exploring as soon as shearing was over, I thought it would be\r\na good thing to take Chowbok with me; so I told him that I meant going to\r\nthe nearer ranges for a few days\' prospecting, and that he was to come\r\ntoo.  I made him promises of nightly grog, and held out the chances of\r\nfinding gold.  I said nothing about the main range, for I knew it would\r\nfrighten him.  I would get him as far up our own river as I could, and\r\ntrace it if possible to its source.  I would then either go on by myself,\r\nif I felt my courage equal to the attempt, or return with Chowbok.  So,\r\nas soon as ever shearing was over and the wool sent off, I asked leave of\r\nabsence, and obtained it.  Also, I bought an old pack-horse and\r\npack-saddle, so that I might take plenty of provisions, and blankets, and\r\na small tent.  I was to ride and find fords over the river; Chowbok was\r\nto follow and lead the pack-horse, which would also carry him over the\r\nfords.  My master let me have tea and sugar, ship\'s biscuits, tobacco,\r\nand salt mutton, with two or three bottles of good brandy; for, as the\r\nwool was now sent down, abundance of provisions would come up with the\r\nempty drays.\r\n\r\nEverything being now ready, all the hands on the station turned out to\r\nsee us off, and we started on our journey, not very long after the summer\r\nsolstice of 1870.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III: UP THE RIVER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first day we had an easy time, following up the great flats by the\r\nriver side, which had already been twice burned, so that there was no\r\ndense undergrowth to check us, though the ground was often rough, and we\r\nhad to go a good deal upon the river-bed.  Towards nightfall we had made\r\na matter of some five-and-twenty miles, and camped at the point where the\r\nriver entered upon the gorge.\r\n\r\nThe weather was delightfully warm, considering that the valley in which\r\nwe were encamped must have been at least two thousand feet above the\r\nlevel of the sea.  The river-bed was here about a mile and a half broad\r\nand entirely covered with shingle over which the river ran in many\r\nwinding channels, looking, when seen from above, like a tangled skein of\r\nribbon, and glistening in the sun.  We knew that it was liable to very\r\nsudden and heavy freshets; but even had we not known it, we could have\r\nseen it by the snags of trees, which must have been carried long\r\ndistances, and by the mass of vegetable and mineral _debris_ which was\r\nbanked against their lower side, showing that at times the whole river-\r\nbed must be covered with a roaring torrent many feet in depth and of\r\nungovernable fury.  At present the river was low, there being but five or\r\nsix streams, too deep and rapid for even a strong man to ford on foot,\r\nbut to be crossed safely on horseback.  On either side of it there were\r\nstill a few acres of flat, which grew wider and wider down the river,\r\ntill they became the large plains on which we looked from my master\'s\r\nhut.  Behind us rose the lowest spurs of the second range, leading\r\nabruptly to the range itself; and at a distance of half a mile began the\r\ngorge, where the river narrowed and became boisterous and terrible.  The\r\nbeauty of the scene cannot be conveyed in language.  The one side of the\r\nvalley was blue with evening shadow, through which loomed forest and\r\nprecipice, hillside and mountain top; and the other was still brilliant\r\nwith the sunset gold.  The wide and wasteful river with its ceaseless\r\nrushing--the beautiful water-birds too, which abounded upon the islets\r\nand were so tame that we could come close up to them--the ineffable\r\npurity of the air--the solemn peacefulness of the untrodden region--could\r\nthere be a more delightful and exhilarating combination?\r\n\r\nWe set about making our camp, close to some large bush which came down\r\nfrom the mountains on to the flat, and tethered out our horses upon\r\nground as free as we could find it from anything round which they might\r\nwind the rope and get themselves tied up.  We dared not let them run\r\nloose, lest they might stray down the river home again.  We then gathered\r\nwood and lit the fire.  We filled a tin pannikin with water and set it\r\nagainst the hot ashes to boil.  When the water boiled we threw in two or\r\nthree large pinches of tea and let them brew.\r\n\r\nWe had caught half a dozen young ducks in the course of the day--an easy\r\nmatter, for the old birds made such a fuss in attempting to decoy us away\r\nfrom them--pretending to be badly hurt as they say the plover does--that\r\nwe could always find them by going about in the opposite direction to the\r\nold bird till we heard the young ones crying: then we ran them down, for\r\nthey could not fly though they were nearly full grown.  Chowbok plucked\r\nthem a little and singed them a good deal.  Then we cut them up and\r\nboiled them in another pannikin, and this completed our preparations.\r\n\r\nWhen we had done supper it was quite dark.  The silence and freshness of\r\nthe night, the occasional sharp cry of the wood-hen, the ruddy glow of\r\nthe fire, the subdued rushing of the river, the sombre forest, and the\r\nimmediate foreground of our saddles packs and blankets, made a picture\r\nworthy of a Salvator Rosa or a Nicolas Poussin.  I call it to mind and\r\ndelight in it now, but I did not notice it at the time.  We next to never\r\nknow when we are well off: but this cuts two ways,--for if we did, we\r\nshould perhaps know better when we are ill off also; and I have sometimes\r\nthought that there are as many ignorant of the one as of the other.  He\r\nwho wrote, "O fortunatos nimium sua si bona norint agricolas," might have\r\nwritten quite as truly, "O infortunatos nimium sua si mala norint"; and\r\nthere are few of us who are not protected from the keenest pain by our\r\ninability to see what it is that we have done, what we are suffering, and\r\nwhat we truly are.  Let us be grateful to the mirror for revealing to us\r\nour appearance only.\r\n\r\nWe found as soft a piece of ground as we could--though it was all\r\nstony--and having collected grass and so disposed of ourselves that we\r\nhad a little hollow for our hip-bones, we strapped our blankets around us\r\nand went to sleep.  Waking in the night I saw the stars overhead and the\r\nmoonlight bright upon the mountains.  The river was ever rushing; I heard\r\none of our horses neigh to its companion, and was assured that they were\r\nstill at hand; I had no care of mind or body, save that I had doubtless\r\nmany difficulties to overcome; there came upon me a delicious sense of\r\npeace, a fulness of contentment which I do not believe can be felt by any\r\nbut those who have spent days consecutively on horseback, or at any rate\r\nin the open air.\r\n\r\nNext morning we found our last night\'s tea-leaves frozen at the bottom of\r\nthe pannikins, though it was not nearly the beginning of autumn; we\r\nbreakfasted as we had supped, and were on our way by six o\'clock.  In\r\nhalf an hour we had entered the gorge, and turning round a corner we bade\r\nfarewell to the last sight of my master\'s country.\r\n\r\nThe gorge was narrow and precipitous; the river was now only a few yards\r\nwide, and roared and thundered against rocks of many tons in weight; the\r\nsound was deafening, for there was a great volume of water.  We were two\r\nhours in making less than a mile, and that with danger, sometimes in the\r\nriver and sometimes on the rock.  There was that damp black smell of\r\nrocks covered with slimy vegetation, as near some huge waterfall where\r\nspray is ever rising.  The air was clammy and cold.  I cannot conceive\r\nhow our horses managed to keep their footing, especially the one with the\r\npack, and I dreaded the having to return almost as much as going forward.\r\nI suppose this lasted three miles, but it was well midday when the gorge\r\ngot a little wider, and a small stream came into it from a tributary\r\nvalley.  Farther progress up the main river was impossible, for the\r\ncliffs descended like walls; so we went up the side stream, Chowbok\r\nseeming to think that here must be the pass of which reports existed\r\namong his people.  We now incurred less of actual danger but more\r\nfatigue, and it was only after infinite trouble, owing to the rocks and\r\ntangled vegetation, that we got ourselves and our horses upon the saddle\r\nfrom which this small stream descended; by that time clouds had descended\r\nupon us, and it was raining heavily.  Moreover, it was six o\'clock and we\r\nwere tired out, having made perhaps six miles in twelve hours.\r\n\r\nOn the saddle there was some coarse grass which was in full seed, and\r\ntherefore very nourishing for the horses; also abundance of anise and sow-\r\nthistle, of which they are extravagantly fond, so we turned them loose\r\nand prepared to camp.  Everything was soaking wet and we were\r\nhalf-perished with cold; indeed we were very uncomfortable.  There was\r\nbrushwood about, but we could get no fire till we had shaved off the wet\r\noutside of some dead branches and filled our pockets with the dry inside\r\nchips.  Having done this we managed to start a fire, nor did we allow it\r\nto go out when we had once started it; we pitched the tent and by nine\r\no\'clock were comparatively warm and dry.  Next morning it was fine; we\r\nbroke camp, and after advancing a short distance we found that, by\r\ndescending over ground less difficult than yesterday\'s, we should come\r\nagain upon the river-bed, which had opened out above the gorge; but it\r\nwas plain at a glance that there was no available sheep country, nothing\r\nbut a few flats covered with scrub on either side the river, and\r\nmountains which were perfectly worthless.  But we could see the main\r\nrange.  There was no mistake about this.  The glaciers were tumbling down\r\nthe mountain sides like cataracts, and seemed actually to descend upon\r\nthe river-bed; there could be no serious difficulty in reaching them by\r\nfollowing up the river, which was wide and open; but it seemed rather an\r\nobjectless thing to do, for the main range looked hopeless, and my\r\ncuriosity about the nature of the country above the gorge was now quite\r\nsatisfied; there was no money in it whatever, unless there should be\r\nminerals, of which I saw no more signs than lower down.\r\n\r\nHowever, I resolved that I would follow the river up, and not return\r\nuntil I was compelled to do so.  I would go up every branch as far as I\r\ncould, and wash well for gold.  Chowbok liked seeing me do this, but it\r\nnever came to anything, for we did not even find the colour.  His dislike\r\nof the main range appeared to have worn off, and he made no objections to\r\napproaching it.  I think he thought there was no danger of my trying to\r\ncross it, and he was not afraid of anything on this side; besides, we\r\nmight find gold.  But the fact was that he had made up his mind what to\r\ndo if he saw me getting too near it.\r\n\r\nWe passed three weeks in exploring, and never did I find time go more\r\nquickly.  The weather was fine, though the nights got very cold.  We\r\nfollowed every stream but one, and always found it lead us to a glacier\r\nwhich was plainly impassable, at any rate without a larger party and\r\nropes.  One stream remained, which I should have followed up already, had\r\nnot Chowbok said that he had risen early one morning while I was yet\r\nasleep, and after going up it for three or four miles, had seen that it\r\nwas impossible to go farther.  I had long ago discovered that he was a\r\ngreat liar, so I was bent on going up myself: in brief, I did so: so far\r\nfrom being impossible, it was quite easy travelling; and after five or\r\nsix miles I saw a saddle at the end of it, which, though covered deep in\r\nsnow, was not glaciered, and which did verily appear to be part of the\r\nmain range itself.  No words can express the intensity of my delight.  My\r\nblood was all on fire with hope and elation; but on looking round for\r\nChowbok, who was behind me, I saw to my surprise and anger that he had\r\nturned back, and was going down the valley as hard as he could.  He had\r\nleft me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV: THE SADDLE\r\n\r\n\r\nI cooeyed to him, but he would not hear.  I ran after him, but he had got\r\ntoo good a start.  Then I sat down on a stone and thought the matter\r\ncarefully over.  It was plain that Chowbok had designedly attempted to\r\nkeep me from going up this valley, yet he had shown no unwillingness to\r\nfollow me anywhere else.  What could this mean, unless that I was now\r\nupon the route by which alone the mysteries of the great ranges could be\r\nrevealed?  What then should I do?  Go back at the very moment when it had\r\nbecome plain that I was on the right scent?  Hardly; yet to proceed alone\r\nwould be both difficult and dangerous.  It would be bad enough to return\r\nto my master\'s run, and pass through the rocky gorges, with no chance of\r\nhelp from another should I get into a difficulty; but to advance for any\r\nconsiderable distance without a companion would be next door to madness.\r\nAccidents which are slight when there is another at hand (as the\r\nspraining of an ankle, or the falling into some place whence escape would\r\nbe easy by means of an outstretched hand and a bit of rope) may be fatal\r\nto one who is alone.  The more I pondered the less I liked it; and yet,\r\nthe less could I make up my mind to return when I looked at the saddle at\r\nthe head of the valley, and noted the comparative ease with which its\r\nsmooth sweep of snow might be surmounted: I seemed to see my way almost\r\nfrom my present position to the very top.  After much thought, I resolved\r\nto go forward until I should come to some place which was really\r\ndangerous, but then to return.  I should thus, I hoped, at any rate reach\r\nthe top of the saddle, and satisfy myself as to what might be on the\r\nother side.\r\n\r\nI had no time to lose, for it was now between ten and eleven in the\r\nmorning.  Fortunately I was well equipped, for on leaving the camp and\r\nthe horses at the lower end of the valley I had provided myself\r\n(according to my custom) with everything that I was likely to want for\r\nfour or five days.  Chowbok had carried half, but had dropped his whole\r\nswag--I suppose, at the moment of his taking flight--for I came upon it\r\nwhen I ran after him.  I had, therefore, his provisions as well as my\r\nown.  Accordingly, I took as many biscuits as I thought I could carry,\r\nand also some tobacco, tea, and a few matches.  I rolled all these things\r\n(together with a flask nearly full of brandy, which I had kept in my\r\npocket for fear lest Chowbok should get hold of it) inside my blankets,\r\nand strapped them very tightly, making the whole into a long roll of some\r\nseven feet in length and six inches in diameter.  Then I tied the two\r\nends together, and put the whole round my neck and over one shoulder.\r\nThis is the easiest way of carrying a heavy swag, for one can rest one\'s\r\nself by shifting the burden from one shoulder to the other.  I strapped\r\nmy pannikin and a small axe about my waist, and thus equipped began to\r\nascend the valley, angry at having been misled by Chowbok, but determined\r\nnot to return till I was compelled to do so.\r\n\r\nI crossed and recrossed the stream several times without difficulty, for\r\nthere were many good fords.  At one o\'clock I was at the foot of the\r\nsaddle; for four hours I mounted, the last two on the snow, where the\r\ngoing was easier; by five, I was within ten minutes of the top, in a\r\nstate of excitement greater, I think, than I had ever known before.  Ten\r\nminutes more, and the cold air from the other side came rushing upon me.\r\n\r\nA glance.  I was _not_ on the main range.\r\n\r\nAnother glance.  There was an awful river, muddy and horribly angry,\r\nroaring over an immense river-bed, thousands of feet below me.\r\n\r\nIt went round to the westward, and I could see no farther up the valley,\r\nsave that there were enormous glaciers which must extend round the source\r\nof the river, and from which it must spring.\r\n\r\nAnother glance, and then I remained motionless.\r\n\r\nThere was an easy pass in the mountains directly opposite to me, through\r\nwhich I caught a glimpse of an immeasurable extent of blue and distant\r\nplains.\r\n\r\nEasy?  Yes, perfectly easy; grassed nearly to the summit, which was, as\r\nit were, an open path between two glaciers, from which an inconsiderable\r\nstream came tumbling down over rough but very possible hillsides, till it\r\ngot down to the level of the great river, and formed a flat where there\r\nwas grass and a small bush of stunted timber.\r\n\r\nAlmost before I could believe my eyes, a cloud had come up from the\r\nvalley on the other side, and the plains were hidden.  What wonderful\r\nluck was mine!  Had I arrived five minutes later, the cloud would have\r\nbeen over the pass, and I should not have known of its existence.  Now\r\nthat the cloud was there, I began to doubt my memory, and to be uncertain\r\nwhether it had been more than a blue line of distant vapour that had\r\nfilled up the opening.  I could only be certain of this much, namely,\r\nthat the river in the valley below must be the one next to the northward\r\nof that which flowed past my master\'s station; of this there could be no\r\ndoubt.  Could I, however, imagine that my luck should have led me up a\r\nwrong river in search of a pass, and yet brought me to the spot where I\r\ncould detect the one weak place in the fortifications of a more northern\r\nbasin?  This was too improbable.  But even as I doubted there came a rent\r\nin the cloud opposite, and a second time I saw blue lines of heaving\r\ndowns, growing gradually fainter, and retiring into a far space of plain.\r\nIt was substantial; there had been no mistake whatsoever.  I had hardly\r\nmade myself perfectly sure of this, ere the rent in the clouds joined up\r\nagain and I could see nothing more.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, should I do?  The night would be upon me shortly, and I was\r\nalready chilled with standing still after the exertion of climbing.  To\r\nstay where I was would be impossible; I must either go backwards or\r\nforwards.  I found a rock which gave me shelter from the evening wind,\r\nand took a good pull at the brandy flask, which immediately warmed and\r\nencouraged me.\r\n\r\nI asked myself, Could I descend upon the river-bed beneath me?  It was\r\nimpossible to say what precipices might prevent my doing so.  If I were\r\non the river-bed, dare I cross the river?  I am an excellent swimmer,\r\nyet, once in that frightful rush of waters, I should be hurled\r\nwhithersoever it willed, absolutely powerless.  Moreover, there was my\r\nswag; I should perish of cold and hunger if I left it, but I should\r\ncertainly be drowned if I attempted to carry it across the river.  These\r\nwere serious considerations, but the hope of finding an immense tract of\r\navailable sheep country (which I was determined that I would monopolise\r\nas far as I possibly could) sufficed to outweigh them; and, in a few\r\nminutes, I felt resolved that, having made so important a discovery as a\r\npass into a country which was probably as valuable as that on our own\r\nside of the ranges, I would follow it up and ascertain its value, even\r\nthough I should pay the penalty of failure with life itself.  The more I\r\nthought, the more determined I became either to win fame and perhaps\r\nfortune, by entering upon this unknown world, or give up life in the\r\nattempt.  In fact, I felt that life would be no longer valuable if I were\r\nto have seen so great a prize and refused to grasp at the possible\r\nprofits therefrom.\r\n\r\nI had still an hour of good daylight during which I might begin my\r\ndescent on to some suitable camping-ground, but there was not a moment to\r\nbe lost.  At first I got along rapidly, for I was on the snow, and sank\r\ninto it enough to save me from falling, though I went forward straight\r\ndown the mountain side as fast as I could; but there was less snow on\r\nthis side than on the other, and I had soon done with it, getting on to a\r\ncoomb of dangerous and very stony ground, where a slip might have given\r\nme a disastrous fall.  But I was careful with all my speed, and got\r\nsafely to the bottom, where there were patches of coarse grass, and an\r\nattempt here and there at brushwood: what was below this I could not see.\r\nI advanced a few hundred yards farther, and found that I was on the brink\r\nof a frightful precipice, which no one in his senses would attempt\r\ndescending.  I bethought me, however, to try the creek which drained the\r\ncoomb, and see whether it might not have made itself a smoother way.  In\r\na few minutes I found myself at the upper end of a chasm in the rocks,\r\nsomething like Twll Dhu, only on a greatly larger scale; the creek had\r\nfound its way into it, and had worn a deep channel through a material\r\nwhich appeared softer than that upon the other side of the mountain.  I\r\nbelieve it must have been a different geological formation, though I\r\nregret to say that I cannot tell what it was.\r\n\r\nI looked at this rift in great doubt; then I went a little way on either\r\nside of it, and found myself looking over the edge of horrible precipices\r\non to the river, which roared some four or five thousand feet below me.  I\r\ndared not think of getting down at all, unless I committed myself to the\r\nrift, of which I was hopeful when I reflected that the rock was soft, and\r\nthat the water might have worn its channel tolerably evenly through the\r\nwhole extent.  The darkness was increasing with every minute, but I\r\nshould have twilight for another half-hour, so I went into the chasm\r\n(though by no means without fear), and resolved to return and camp, and\r\ntry some other path next day, should I come to any serious difficulty.  In\r\nabout five minutes I had completely lost my head; the side of the rift\r\nbecame hundreds of feet in height, and overhung so that I could not see\r\nthe sky.  It was full of rocks, and I had many falls and bruises.  I was\r\nwet through from falling into the water, of which there was no great\r\nvolume, but it had such force that I could do nothing against it; once I\r\nhad to leap down a not inconsiderable waterfall into a deep pool below,\r\nand my swag was so heavy that I was very nearly drowned.  I had indeed a\r\nhair\'s-breadth escape; but, as luck would have it, Providence was on my\r\nside.  Shortly afterwards I began to fancy that the rift was getting\r\nwider, and that there was more brushwood.  Presently I found myself on an\r\nopen grassy slope, and feeling my way a little farther along the stream,\r\nI came upon a flat place with wood, where I could camp comfortably; which\r\nwas well, for it was now quite dark.\r\n\r\nMy first care was for my matches; were they dry?  The outside of my swag\r\nhad got completely wet; but, on undoing the blankets, I found things warm\r\nand dry within.  How thankful I was!  I lit a fire, and was grateful for\r\nits warmth and company.  I made myself some tea and ate two of my\r\nbiscuits: my brandy I did not touch, for I had little left, and might\r\nwant it when my courage failed me.  All that I did, I did almost\r\nmechanically, for I could not realise my situation to myself, beyond\r\nknowing that I was alone, and that return through the chasm which I had\r\njust descended would be impossible.  It is a dreadful feeling that of\r\nbeing cut off from all one\'s kind.  I was still full of hope, and built\r\ngolden castles for myself as soon as I was warmed with food and fire; but\r\nI do not believe that any man could long retain his reason in such\r\nsolitude, unless he had the companionship of animals.  One begins\r\ndoubting one\'s own identity.\r\n\r\nI remember deriving comfort even from the sight of my blankets, and the\r\nsound of my watch ticking--things which seemed to link me to other\r\npeople; but the screaming of the wood-hens frightened me, as also a\r\nchattering bird which I had never heard before, and which seemed to laugh\r\nat me; though I soon got used to it, and before long could fancy that it\r\nwas many years since I had first heard it.\r\n\r\nI took off my clothes, and wrapped my inside blanket about me, till my\r\nthings were dry.  The night was very still, and I made a roaring fire; so\r\nI soon got warm, and at last could put my clothes on again.  Then I\r\nstrapped my blanket round me, and went to sleep as near the fire as I\r\ncould.\r\n\r\nI dreamed that there was an organ placed in my master\'s wool-shed: the\r\nwool-shed faded away, and the organ seemed to grow and grow amid a blaze\r\nof brilliant light, till it became like a golden city upon the side of a\r\nmountain, with rows upon rows of pipes set in cliffs and precipices, one\r\nabove the other, and in mysterious caverns, like that of Fingal, within\r\nwhose depths I could see the burnished pillars gleaming.  In the front\r\nthere was a flight of lofty terraces, at the top of which I could see a\r\nman with his head buried forward towards a key-board, and his body\r\nswaying from side to side amid the storm of huge arpeggioed harmonies\r\nthat came crashing overhead and round.  Then there was one who touched me\r\non the shoulder, and said, "Do you not see? it is Handel";--but I had\r\nhardly apprehended, and was trying to scale the terraces, and get near\r\nhim, when I awoke, dazzled with the vividness and distinctness of the\r\ndream.\r\n\r\nA piece of wood had burned through, and the ends had fallen into the\r\nashes with a blaze: this, I supposed, had both given me my dream and\r\nrobbed me of it.  I was bitterly disappointed, and sitting up on my\r\nelbow, came back to reality and my strange surroundings as best I could.\r\n\r\nI was thoroughly aroused--moreover, I felt a foreshadowing as though my\r\nattention were arrested by something more than the dream, although no\r\nsense in particular was as yet appealed to.  I held my breath and waited,\r\nand then I heard--was it fancy?  Nay; I listened again and again, and I\r\n_did_ hear a faint and extremely distant sound of music, like that of an\r\nAEolian harp, borne upon the wind which was blowing fresh and chill from\r\nthe opposite mountains.\r\n\r\nThe roots of my hair thrilled.  I listened, but the wind had died; and,\r\nfancying that it must have been the wind itself--no; on a sudden I\r\nremembered the noise which Chowbok had made in the wool-shed.  Yes; it\r\nwas that.\r\n\r\nThank Heaven, whatever it was, it was over now.  I reasoned with myself,\r\nand recovered my firmness.  I became convinced that I had only been\r\ndreaming more vividly than usual.  Soon I began even to laugh, and think\r\nwhat a fool I was to be frightened at nothing, reminding myself that even\r\nif I were to come to a bad end it would be no such dreadful matter after\r\nall.  I said my prayers, a duty which I had too often neglected, and in a\r\nlittle time fell into a really refreshing sleep, which lasted till broad\r\ndaylight, and restored me.  I rose, and searching among the embers of my\r\nfire, I found a few live coals and soon had a blaze again.  I got\r\nbreakfast, and was delighted to have the company of several small birds,\r\nwhich hopped about me and perched on my boots and hands.  I felt\r\ncomparatively happy, but I can assure the reader that I had had a far\r\nworse time of it than I have told him; and I strongly recommend him to\r\nremain in Europe if he can; or, at any rate, in some country which has\r\nbeen explored and settled, rather than go into places where others have\r\nnot been before him.  Exploring is delightful to look forward to and back\r\nupon, but it is not comfortable at the time, unless it be of such an easy\r\nnature as not to deserve the name.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V: THE RIVER AND THE RANGE\r\n\r\n\r\nMy next business was to descend upon the river.  I had lost sight of the\r\npass which I had seen from the saddle, but had made such notes of it that\r\nI could not fail to find it.  I was bruised and stiff, and my boots had\r\nbegun to give, for I had been going on rough ground for more than three\r\nweeks; but, as the day wore on, and I found myself descending without\r\nserious difficulty, I became easier.  In a couple of hours I got among\r\npine forests where there was little undergrowth, and descended quickly\r\ntill I reached the edge of another precipice, which gave me a great deal\r\nof trouble, though I eventually managed to avoid it.  By about three or\r\nfour o\'clock I found myself on the river-bed.\r\n\r\nFrom calculations which I made as to the height of the valley on the\r\nother side the saddle over which I had come, I concluded that the saddle\r\nitself could not be less than nine thousand feet high; and I should think\r\nthat the river-bed, on to which I now descended, was three thousand feet\r\nabove the sea-level.  The water had a terrific current, with a fall of\r\nnot less than forty to fifty feet per mile.  It was certainly the river\r\nnext to the northward of that which flowed past my master\'s run, and\r\nwould have to go through an impassable gorge (as is commonly the case\r\nwith the rivers of that country) before it came upon known parts.  It was\r\nreckoned to be nearly two thousand feet above the sea-level where it came\r\nout of the gorge on to the plains.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I got to the river side I liked it even less than I thought I\r\nshould.  It was muddy, being near its parent glaciers.  The stream was\r\nwide, rapid, and rough, and I could hear the smaller stones knocking\r\nagainst each other under the rage of the waters, as upon a seashore.\r\nFording was out of the question.  I could not swim and carry my swag, and\r\nI dared not leave my swag behind me.  My only chance was to make a small\r\nraft; and that would be difficult to make, and not at all safe when it\r\nwas made,--not for one man in such a current.\r\n\r\nAs it was too late to do much that afternoon, I spent the rest of it in\r\ngoing up and down the river side, and seeing where I should find the most\r\nfavourable crossing.  Then I camped early, and had a quiet comfortable\r\nnight with no more music, for which I was thankful, as it had haunted me\r\nall day, although I perfectly well knew that it had been nothing but my\r\nown fancy, brought on by the reminiscence of what I had heard from\r\nChowbok and by the over-excitement of the preceding evening.\r\n\r\nNext day I began gathering the dry bloom stalks of a kind of flag or iris-\r\nlooking plant, which was abundant, and whose leaves, when torn into\r\nstrips, were as strong as the strongest string.  I brought them to the\r\nwaterside, and fell to making myself a kind of rough platform, which\r\nshould suffice for myself and my swag if I could only stick to it.  The\r\nstalks were ten or twelve feet long, and very strong, but light and\r\nhollow.  I made my raft entirely of them, binding bundles of them at\r\nright angles to each other, neatly and strongly, with strips from the\r\nleaves of the same plant, and tying other rods across.  It took me all\r\nday till nearly four o\'clock to finish the raft, but I had still enough\r\ndaylight for crossing, and resolved on doing so at once.\r\n\r\nI had selected a place where the river was broad and comparatively still,\r\nsome seventy or eighty yards above a furious rapid.  At this spot I had\r\nbuilt my raft.  I now launched it, made my swag fast to the middle, and\r\ngot on to it myself, keeping in my hand one of the longest blossom\r\nstalks, so that I might punt myself across as long as the water was\r\nshallow enough to let me do so.  I got on pretty well for twenty or\r\nthirty yards from the shore, but even in this short space I nearly upset\r\nmy raft by shifting too rapidly from one side to the other.  The water\r\nthen became much deeper, and I leaned over so far in order to get the\r\nbloom rod to the bottom that I had to stay still, leaning on the rod for\r\na few seconds.  Then, when I lifted up the rod from the ground, the\r\ncurrent was too much for me and I found myself being carried down the\r\nrapid.  Everything in a second flew past me, and I had no more control\r\nover the raft; neither can I remember anything except hurry, and noise,\r\nand waters which in the end upset me.  But it all came right, and I found\r\nmyself near the shore, not more than up to my knees in water and pulling\r\nmy raft to land, fortunately upon the left bank of the river, which was\r\nthe one I wanted.  When I had landed I found that I was about a mile, or\r\nperhaps a little less, below the point from which I started.  My swag was\r\nwet upon the outside, and I was myself dripping; but I had gained my\r\npoint, and knew that my difficulties were for a time over.  I then lit my\r\nfire and dried myself; having done so I caught some of the young ducks\r\nand sea-gulls, which were abundant on and near the river-bed, so that I\r\nhad not only a good meal, of which I was in great want, having had an\r\ninsufficient diet from the time that Chowbok left me, but was also well\r\nprovided for the morrow.\r\n\r\nI thought of Chowbok, and felt how useful he had been to me, and in how\r\nmany ways I was the loser by his absence, having now to do all sorts of\r\nthings for myself which he had hitherto done for me, and could do\r\ninfinitely better than I could.  Moreover, I had set my heart upon making\r\nhim a real convert to the Christian religion, which he had already\r\nembraced outwardly, though I cannot think that it had taken deep root in\r\nhis impenetrably stupid nature.  I used to catechise him by our camp\r\nfire, and explain to him the mysteries of the Trinity and of original\r\nsin, with which I was myself familiar, having been the grandson of an\r\narchdeacon by my mother\'s side, to say nothing of the fact that my father\r\nwas a clergyman of the English Church.  I was therefore sufficiently\r\nqualified for the task, and was the more inclined to it, over and above\r\nmy real desire to save the unhappy creature from an eternity of torture,\r\nby recollecting the promise of St. James, that if any one converted a\r\nsinner (which Chowbok surely was) he should hide a multitude of sins.  I\r\nreflected, therefore, that the conversion of Chowbok might in some degree\r\ncompensate for irregularities and short-comings in my own previous life,\r\nthe remembrance of which had been more than once unpleasant to me during\r\nmy recent experiences.\r\n\r\nIndeed, on one occasion I had even gone so far as to baptize him, as well\r\nas I could, having ascertained that he had certainly not been both\r\nchristened and baptized, and gathering (from his telling me that he had\r\nreceived the name William from the missionary) that it was probably the\r\nfirst-mentioned rite to which he had been subjected.  I thought it great\r\ncarelessness on the part of the missionary to have omitted the second,\r\nand certainly more important, ceremony which I have always understood\r\nprecedes christening both in the case of infants and of adult converts;\r\nand when I thought of the risks we were both incurring I determined that\r\nthere should be no further delay.  Fortunately it was not yet twelve\r\no\'clock, so I baptized him at once from one of the pannikins (the only\r\nvessels I had) reverently, and, I trust, efficiently.  I then set myself\r\nto work to instruct him in the deeper mysteries of our belief, and to\r\nmake him, not only in name, but in heart a Christian.\r\n\r\nIt is true that I might not have succeeded, for Chowbok was very hard to\r\nteach.  Indeed, on the evening of the same day that I baptized him he\r\ntried for the twentieth time to steal the brandy, which made me rather\r\nunhappy as to whether I could have baptized him rightly.  He had a prayer-\r\nbook--more than twenty years old--which had been given him by the\r\nmissionaries, but the only thing in it which had taken any living hold\r\nupon him was the title of Adelaide the Queen Dowager, which he would\r\nrepeat whenever strongly moved or touched, and which did really seem to\r\nhave some deep spiritual significance to him, though he could never\r\ncompletely separate her individuality from that of Mary Magdalene, whose\r\nname had also fascinated him, though in a less degree.\r\n\r\nHe was indeed stony ground, but by digging about him I might have at any\r\nrate deprived him of all faith in the religion of his tribe, which would\r\nhave been half way towards making him a sincere Christian; and now all\r\nthis was cut off from me, and I could neither be of further spiritual\r\nassistance to him nor he of bodily profit to myself: besides, any company\r\nwas better than being quite alone.\r\n\r\nI got very melancholy as these reflections crossed me, but when I had\r\nboiled the ducks and eaten them I was much better.  I had a little tea\r\nleft and about a pound of tobacco, which should last me for another\r\nfortnight with moderate smoking.  I had also eight ship biscuits, and,\r\nmost precious of all, about six ounces of brandy, which I presently\r\nreduced to four, for the night was cold.\r\n\r\nI rose with early dawn, and in an hour I was on my way, feeling strange,\r\nnot to say weak, from the burden of solitude, but full of hope when I\r\nconsidered how many dangers I had overcome, and that this day should see\r\nme at the summit of the dividing range.\r\n\r\nAfter a slow but steady climb of between three and four hours, during\r\nwhich I met with no serious hindrance, I found myself upon a tableland,\r\nand close to a glacier which I recognised as marking the summit of the\r\npass.  Above it towered a succession of rugged precipices and snowy\r\nmountain sides.  The solitude was greater than I could bear; the mountain\r\nupon my master\'s sheep-run was a crowded thoroughfare in comparison with\r\nthis sombre sullen place.  The air, moreover, was dark and heavy, which\r\nmade the loneliness even more oppressive.  There was an inky gloom over\r\nall that was not covered with snow and ice.  Grass there was none.\r\n\r\nEach moment I felt increasing upon me that dreadful doubt as to my own\r\nidentity--as to the continuity of my past and present existence--which is\r\nthe first sign of that distraction which comes on those who have lost\r\nthemselves in the bush.  I had fought against this feeling hitherto, and\r\nhad conquered it; but the intense silence and gloom of this rocky\r\nwilderness were too much for me, and I felt that my power of collecting\r\nmyself was beginning to be impaired.\r\n\r\nI rested for a little while, and then advanced over very rough ground,\r\nuntil I reached the lower end of the glacier.  Then I saw another\r\nglacier, descending from the eastern side into a small lake.  I passed\r\nalong the western side of the lake, where the ground was easier, and when\r\nI had got about half way I expected that I should see the plains which I\r\nhad already seen from the opposite mountains; but it was not to be so,\r\nfor the clouds rolled up to the very summit of the pass, though they did\r\nnot overlip it on to the side from which I had come.  I therefore soon\r\nfound myself enshrouded by a cold thin vapour, which prevented my seeing\r\nmore than a very few yards in front of me.  Then I came upon a large\r\npatch of old snow, in which I could distinctly trace the half-melted\r\ntracks of goats--and in one place, as it seemed to me, there had been a\r\ndog following them.  Had I lighted upon a land of shepherds?  The ground,\r\nwhere not covered with snow, was so poor and stony, and there was so\r\nlittle herbage, that I could see no sign of a path or regular\r\nsheep-track.  But I could not help feeling rather uneasy as I wondered\r\nwhat sort of a reception I might meet with if I were to come suddenly\r\nupon inhabitants.  I was thinking of this, and proceeding cautiously\r\nthrough the mist, when I began to fancy that I saw some objects darker\r\nthan the cloud looming in front of me.  A few steps brought me nearer,\r\nand a shudder of unutterable horror ran through me when I saw a circle of\r\ngigantic forms, many times higher than myself, upstanding grim and grey\r\nthrough the veil of cloud before me.\r\n\r\nI suppose I must have fainted, for I found myself some time afterwards\r\nsitting upon the ground, sick and deadly cold.  There were the figures,\r\nquite still and silent, seen vaguely through the thick gloom, but in\r\nhuman shape indisputably.\r\n\r\nA sudden thought occurred to me, which would have doubtless struck me at\r\nonce had I not been prepossessed with forebodings at the time that I\r\nfirst saw the figures, and had not the cloud concealed them from me--I\r\nmean that they were not living beings, but statues.  I determined that I\r\nwould count fifty slowly, and was sure that the objects were not alive if\r\nduring that time I could detect no sign of motion.\r\n\r\nHow thankful was I when I came to the end of my fifty and there had been\r\nno movement!\r\n\r\nI counted a second time--but again all was still.\r\n\r\nI then advanced timidly forward, and in another moment I saw that my\r\nsurmise was correct.  I had come upon a sort of Stonehenge of rude and\r\nbarbaric figures, seated as Chowbok had sat when I questioned him in the\r\nwool-shed, and with the same superhumanly malevolent expression upon\r\ntheir faces.  They had been all seated, but two had fallen.  They were\r\nbarbarous--neither Egyptian, nor Assyrian, nor Japanese--different from\r\nany of these, and yet akin to all.  They were six or seven times larger\r\nthan life, of great antiquity, worn and lichen grown.  They were ten in\r\nnumber.  There was snow upon their heads and wherever snow could lodge.\r\nEach statue had been built of four or five enormous blocks, but how these\r\nhad been raised and put together is known to those alone who raised them.\r\nEach was terrible after a different kind.  One was raging furiously, as\r\nin pain and great despair; another was lean and cadaverous with famine;\r\nanother cruel and idiotic, but with the silliest simper that can be\r\nconceived--this one had fallen, and looked exquisitely ludicrous in his\r\nfall--the mouths of all were more or less open, and as I looked at them\r\nfrom behind, I saw that their heads had been hollowed.\r\n\r\nI was sick and shivering with cold.  Solitude had unmanned me already,\r\nand I was utterly unfit to have come upon such an assembly of fiends in\r\nsuch a dreadful wilderness and without preparation.  I would have given\r\neverything I had in the world to have been back at my master\'s station;\r\nbut that was not to be thought of: my head was failing, and I felt sure\r\nthat I could never get back alive.\r\n\r\nThen came a gust of howling wind, accompanied with a moan from one of the\r\nstatues above me.  I clasped my hands in fear.  I felt like a rat caught\r\nin a trap, as though I would have turned and bitten at whatever thing was\r\nnearest me.  The wildness of the wind increased, the moans grew shriller,\r\ncoming from several statues, and swelling into a chorus.  I almost\r\nimmediately knew what it was, but the sound was so unearthly that this\r\nwas but little consolation.  The inhuman beings into whose hearts the\r\nEvil One had put it to conceive these statues, had made their heads into\r\na sort of organ-pipe, so that their mouths should catch the wind and\r\nsound with its blowing.  It was horrible.  However brave a man might be,\r\nhe could never stand such a concert, from such lips, and in such a place.\r\nI heaped every invective upon them that my tongue could utter as I rushed\r\naway from them into the mist, and even after I had lost sight of them,\r\nand turning my head round could see nothing but the storm-wraiths driving\r\nbehind me, I heard their ghostly chanting, and felt as though one of them\r\nwould rush after me and grip me in his hand and throttle me.\r\n\r\nI may say here that, since my return to England, I heard a friend playing\r\nsome chords upon the organ which put me very forcibly in mind of the\r\nErewhonian statues (for Erewhon is the name of the country upon which I\r\nwas now entering).  They rose most vividly to my recollection the moment\r\nmy friend began.  They are as follows, and are by the greatest of all\r\nmusicians:--{2}\r\n\r\n[Music score which cannot be reproduced]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI: INTO EREWHON\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now I found myself on a narrow path which followed a small\r\nwatercourse.  I was too glad to have an easy track for my flight, to lay\r\nhold of the full significance of its existence.  The thought, however,\r\nsoon presented itself to me that I must be in an inhabited country, but\r\none which was yet unknown.  What, then, was to be my fate at the hands of\r\nits inhabitants?  Should I be taken and offered up as a burnt-offering to\r\nthose hideous guardians of the pass?  It might be so.  I shuddered at the\r\nthought, yet the horrors of solitude had now fairly possessed me; and so\r\ndazed was I, and chilled, and woebegone, that I could lay hold of no idea\r\nfirmly amid the crowd of fancies that kept wandering in upon my brain.\r\n\r\nI hurried onward--down, down, down.  More streams came in; then there was\r\na bridge, a few pine logs thrown over the water; but they gave me\r\ncomfort, for savages do not make bridges.  Then I had a treat such as I\r\ncan never convey on paper--a moment, perhaps, the most striking and\r\nunexpected in my whole life--the one I think that, with some three or\r\nfour exceptions, I would most gladly have again, were I able to recall\r\nit.  I got below the level of the clouds, into a burst of brilliant\r\nevening sunshine, I was facing the north-west, and the sun was full upon\r\nme.  Oh, how its light cheered me!  But what I saw!  It was such an\r\nexpanse as was revealed to Moses when he stood upon the summit of Mount\r\nSinai, and beheld that promised land which it was not to be his to enter.\r\nThe beautiful sunset sky was crimson and gold; blue, silver, and purple;\r\nexquisite and tranquillising; fading away therein were plains, on which I\r\ncould see many a town and city, with buildings that had lofty steeples\r\nand rounded domes.  Nearer beneath me lay ridge behind ridge, outline\r\nbehind outline, sunlight behind shadow, and shadow behind sunlight, gully\r\nand serrated ravine.  I saw large pine forests, and the glitter of a\r\nnoble river winding its way upon the plains; also many villages and\r\nhamlets, some of them quite near at hand; and it was on these that I\r\npondered most.  I sank upon the ground at the foot of a large tree and\r\nthought what I had best do; but I could not collect myself.  I was quite\r\ntired out; and presently, feeling warmed by the sun, and quieted, I fell\r\noff into a profound sleep.\r\n\r\nI was awoke by the sound of tinkling bells, and looking up, I saw four or\r\nfive goats feeding near me.  As soon as I moved, the creatures turned\r\ntheir heads towards me with an expression of infinite wonder.  They did\r\nnot run away, but stood stock still, and looked at me from every side, as\r\nI at them.  Then came the sound of chattering and laughter, and there\r\napproached two lovely girls, of about seventeen or eighteen years old,\r\ndressed each in a sort of linen gaberdine, with a girdle round the waist.\r\nThey saw me.  I sat quite still and looked at them, dazzled with their\r\nextreme beauty.  For a moment they looked at me and at each other in\r\ngreat amazement; then they gave a little frightened cry and ran off as\r\nhard as they could.\r\n\r\n"So that\'s that," said I to myself, as I watched them scampering.  I knew\r\nthat I had better stay where I was and meet my fate, whatever it was to\r\nbe, and even if there were a better course, I had no strength left to\r\ntake it.  I must come into contact with the inhabitants sooner or later,\r\nand it might as well be sooner.  Better not to seem afraid of them, as I\r\nshould do by running away and being caught with a hue and cry to-morrow\r\nor next day.  So I remained quite still and waited.  In about an hour I\r\nheard distant voices talking excitedly, and in a few minutes I saw the\r\ntwo girls bringing up a party of six or seven men, well armed with bows\r\nand arrows and pikes.  There was nothing for it, so I remained sitting\r\nquite still, even after they had seen me, until they came close up.  Then\r\nwe all had a good look at one another.\r\n\r\nBoth the girls and the men were very dark in colour, but not more so than\r\nthe South Italians or Spaniards.  The men wore no trousers, but were\r\ndressed nearly the same as the Arabs whom I have seen in Algeria.  They\r\nwere of the most magnificent presence, being no less strong and handsome\r\nthan the women were beautiful; and not only this, but their expression\r\nwas courteous and benign.  I think they would have killed me at once if I\r\nhad made the slightest show of violence; but they gave me no impression\r\nof their being likely to hurt me so long as I was quiet.  I am not much\r\ngiven to liking anybody at first sight, but these people impressed me\r\nmuch more favourably than I should have thought possible, so that I could\r\nnot fear them as I scanned their faces one after another.  They were all\r\npowerful men.  I might have been a match for any one of them singly, for\r\nI have been told that I have more to glory in the flesh than in any other\r\nrespect, being over six feet and proportionately strong; but any two\r\ncould have soon mastered me, even were I not so bereft of energy by my\r\nrecent adventures.  My colour seemed to surprise them most, for I have\r\nlight hair, blue eyes, and a fresh complexion.  They could not understand\r\nhow these things could be; my clothes also seemed quite beyond them.\r\nTheir eyes kept wandering all over me, and the more they looked the less\r\nthey seemed able to make me out.\r\n\r\nAt last I raised myself upon my feet, and leaning upon my stick, I spoke\r\nwhatever came into my head to the man who seemed foremost among them.  I\r\nspoke in English, though I was very sure that he would not understand.  I\r\nsaid that I had no idea what country I was in; that I had stumbled upon\r\nit almost by accident, after a series of hairbreadth escapes; and that I\r\ntrusted they would not allow any evil to overtake me now that I was\r\ncompletely at their mercy.  All this I said quietly and firmly, with\r\nhardly any change of expression.  They could not understand me, but they\r\nlooked approvingly to one another, and seemed pleased (so I thought) that\r\nI showed no fear nor acknowledgment of inferiority--the fact being that I\r\nwas exhausted beyond the sense of fear.  Then one of them pointed to the\r\nmountain, in the direction of the statues, and made a grimace in\r\nimitation of one of them.  I laughed and shuddered expressively, whereon\r\nthey all burst out laughing too, and chattered hard to one another.  I\r\ncould make out nothing of what they said, but I think they thought it\r\nrather a good joke that I had come past the statues.  Then one among them\r\ncame forward and motioned me to follow, which I did without hesitation,\r\nfor I dared not thwart them; moreover, I liked them well enough, and felt\r\ntolerably sure that they had no intention of hurting me.\r\n\r\nIn about a quarter of an hour we got to a small hamlet built on the side\r\nof a hill, with a narrow street and houses huddled up together.  The\r\nroofs were large and overhanging.  Some few windows were glazed, but not\r\nmany.  Altogether the village was exceedingly like one of those that one\r\ncomes upon in descending the less known passes over the Alps on to\r\nLombardy.  I will pass over the excitement which my arrival caused.\r\nSuffice it, that though there was abundance of curiosity, there was no\r\nrudeness.  I was taken to the principal house, which seemed to belong to\r\nthe people who had captured me.  There I was hospitably entertained, and\r\na supper of milk and goat\'s flesh with a kind of oatcake was set before\r\nme, of which I ate heartily.  But all the time I was eating I could not\r\nhelp turning my eyes upon the two beautiful girls whom I had first seen,\r\nand who seemed to consider me as their lawful prize--which indeed I was,\r\nfor I would have gone through fire and water for either of them.\r\n\r\nThen came the inevitable surprise at seeing me smoke, which I will spare\r\nthe reader; but I noticed that when they saw me strike a match, there was\r\na hubbub of excitement which, it struck me, was not altogether unmixed\r\nwith disapproval: why, I could not guess.  Then the women retired, and I\r\nwas left alone with the men, who tried to talk to me in every conceivable\r\nway; but we could come to no understanding, except that I was quite\r\nalone, and had come from a long way over the mountains.  In the course of\r\ntime they grew tired, and I very sleepy.  I made signs as though I would\r\nsleep on the floor in my blankets, but they gave me one of their bunks\r\nwith plenty of dried fern and grass, on to which I had no sooner laid\r\nmyself than I fell fast asleep; nor did I awake till well into the\r\nfollowing day, when I found myself in the hut with two men keeping guard\r\nover me and an old woman cooking.  When I woke the men seemed pleased,\r\nand spoke to me as though bidding me good morning in a pleasant tone.\r\n\r\nI went out of doors to wash in a creek which ran a few yards from the\r\nhouse.  My hosts were as engrossed with me as ever; they never took their\r\neyes off me, following every action that I did, no matter how trifling,\r\nand each looking towards the other for his opinion at every touch and\r\nturn.  They took great interest in my ablutions, for they seemed to have\r\ndoubted whether I was in all respects human like themselves.  They even\r\nlaid hold of my arms and overhauled them, and expressed approval when\r\nthey saw that they were strong and muscular.  They now examined my legs,\r\nand especially my feet.  When they desisted they nodded approvingly to\r\neach other; and when I had combed and brushed my hair, and generally made\r\nmyself as neat and well arranged as circumstances would allow, I could\r\nsee that their respect for me increased greatly, and that they were by no\r\nmeans sure that they had treated me with sufficient deference--a matter\r\non which I am not competent to decide.  All I know is that they were very\r\ngood to me, for which I thanked them heartily, as it might well have been\r\notherwise.\r\n\r\nFor my own part, I liked them and admired them, for their quiet\r\nself-possession and dignified ease impressed me pleasurably at once.\r\nNeither did their manner make me feel as though I were personally\r\ndistasteful to them--only that I was a thing utterly new and unlooked\r\nfor, which they could not comprehend.  Their type was more that of the\r\nmost robust Italians than any other; their manners also were eminently\r\nItalian, in their entire unconsciousness of self.  Having travelled a\r\ngood deal in Italy, I was struck with little gestures of the hand and\r\nshoulders, which constantly reminded me of that country.  My feeling was\r\nthat my wisest plan would be to go on as I had begun, and be simply\r\nmyself for better or worse, such as I was, and take my chance\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\nI thought of these things while they were waiting for me to have done\r\nwashing, and on my way back.  Then they gave me breakfast--hot bread and\r\nmilk, and fried flesh of something between mutton and venison.  Their\r\nways of cooking and eating were European, though they had only a skewer\r\nfor a fork, and a sort of butcher\'s knife to cut with.  The more I looked\r\nat everything in the house, the more I was struck with its quasi-European\r\ncharacter; and had the walls only been pasted over with extracts from the\r\n_Illustrated London News_ and _Punch_, I could have almost fancied myself\r\nin a shepherd\'s hut upon my master\'s sheep-run.  And yet everything was\r\nslightly different.  It was much the same with the birds and flowers on\r\nthe other side, as compared with the English ones.  On my arrival I had\r\nbeen pleased at noticing that nearly all the plants and birds were very\r\nlike common English ones: thus, there was a robin, and a lark, and a\r\nwren, and daisies, and dandelions; not quite the same as the English, but\r\nstill very like them--quite like enough to be called by the same name; so\r\nnow, here, the ways of these two men, and the things they had in the\r\nhouse, were all very nearly the same as in Europe.  It was not at all\r\nlike going to China or Japan, where everything that one sees is strange.\r\nI was, indeed, at once struck with the primitive character of their\r\nappliances, for they seemed to be some five or six hundred years behind\r\nEurope in their inventions; but this is the case in many an Italian\r\nvillage.\r\n\r\nAll the time that I was eating my breakfast I kept speculating as to what\r\nfamily of mankind they could belong to; and shortly there came an idea\r\ninto my head, which brought the blood into my cheeks with excitement as I\r\nthought of it.  Was it possible that they might be the lost ten tribes of\r\nIsrael, of whom I had heard both my grandfather and my father make\r\nmention as existing in an unknown country, and awaiting a final return to\r\nPalestine?  Was it possible that I might have been designed by Providence\r\nas the instrument of their conversion?  Oh, what a thought was this!  I\r\nlaid down my skewer and gave them a hasty survey.  There was nothing of a\r\nJewish type about them: their noses were distinctly Grecian, and their\r\nlips, though full, were not Jewish.\r\n\r\nHow could I settle this question?  I knew neither Greek nor Hebrew, and\r\neven if I should get to understand the language here spoken, I should be\r\nunable to detect the roots of either of these tongues.  I had not been\r\nlong enough among them to ascertain their habits, but they did not give\r\nme the impression of being a religious people.  This too was natural: the\r\nten tribes had been always lamentably irreligious.  But could I not make\r\nthem change?  To restore the lost ten tribes of Israel to a knowledge of\r\nthe only truth: here would be indeed an immortal crown of glory!  My\r\nheart beat fast and furious as I entertained the thought.  What a\r\nposition would it not ensure me in the next world; or perhaps even in\r\nthis!  What folly it would be to throw such a chance away!  I should rank\r\nnext to the Apostles, if not as high as they--certainly above the minor\r\nprophets, and possibly above any Old Testament writer except Moses and\r\nIsaiah.  For such a future as this I would sacrifice all that I have\r\nwithout a moment\'s hesitation, could I be reasonably assured of it.  I\r\nhad always cordially approved of missionary efforts, and had at times\r\ncontributed my mite towards their support and extension; but I had never\r\nhitherto felt drawn towards becoming a missionary myself; and indeed had\r\nalways admired, and envied, and respected them, more than I had exactly\r\nliked them.  But if these people were the lost ten tribes of Israel, the\r\ncase would be widely different: the opening was too excellent to be lost,\r\nand I resolved that should I see indications which appeared to confirm my\r\nimpression that I had indeed come upon the missing tribes, I would\r\ncertainly convert them.\r\n\r\nI may here mention that this discovery is the one to which I alluded in\r\nthe opening pages of my story.  Time strengthened the impression made\r\nupon me at first; and, though I remained in doubt for several months, I\r\nfeel now no longer uncertain.\r\n\r\nWhen I had done eating, my hosts approached, and pointed down the valley\r\nleading to their own country, as though wanting to show that I must go\r\nwith them; at the same time they laid hold of my arms, and made as though\r\nthey would take me, but used no violence.  I laughed, and motioned my\r\nhand across my throat, pointing down the valley as though I was afraid\r\nlest I should be killed when I got there.  But they divined me at once,\r\nand shook their heads with much decision, to show that I was in no\r\ndanger.  Their manner quite reassured me; and in half an hour or so I had\r\npacked up my swag, and was eager for the forward journey, feeling\r\nwonderfully strengthened and refreshed by good food and sleep, while my\r\nhope and curiosity were aroused to their very utmost by the extraordinary\r\nposition in which I found myself.\r\n\r\nBut already my excitement had begun to cool and I reflected that these\r\npeople might not be the ten tribes after all; in which case I could not\r\nbut regret that my hopes of making money, which had led me into so much\r\ntrouble and danger, were almost annihilated by the fact that the country\r\nwas full to overflowing, with a people who had probably already developed\r\nits more available resources.  Moreover, how was I to get back?  For\r\nthere was something about my hosts which told me that they had got me,\r\nand meant to keep me, in spite of all their goodness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII: FIRST IMPRESSIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nWe followed an Alpine path for some four miles, now hundreds of feet\r\nabove a brawling stream which descended from the glaciers, and now nearly\r\nalongside it.  The morning was cold and somewhat foggy, for the autumn\r\nhad made great strides latterly.  Sometimes we went through forests of\r\npine, or rather yew trees, though they looked like pine; and I remember\r\nthat now and again we passed a little wayside shrine, wherein there would\r\nbe a statue of great beauty, representing some figure, male or female, in\r\nthe very heyday of youth, strength, and beauty, or of the most dignified\r\nmaturity and old age.  My hosts always bowed their heads as they passed\r\none of these shrines, and it shocked me to see statues that had no\r\napparent object, beyond the chronicling of some unusual individual\r\nexcellence or beauty, receive so serious a homage.  However, I showed no\r\nsign of wonder or disapproval; for I remembered that to be all things to\r\nall men was one of the injunctions of the Gentile Apostle, which for the\r\npresent I should do well to heed.  Shortly after passing one of these\r\nchapels we came suddenly upon a village which started up out of the mist;\r\nand I was alarmed lest I should be made an object of curiosity or\r\ndislike.  But it was not so.  My guides spoke to many in passing, and\r\nthose spoken to showed much amazement.  My guides, however, were well\r\nknown, and the natural politeness of the people prevented them from\r\nputting me to any inconvenience; but they could not help eyeing me, nor I\r\nthem.  I may as well say at once what my after-experience taught\r\nme--namely, that with all their faults and extraordinary obliquity of\r\nmental vision upon many subjects, they are the very best-bred people that\r\nI ever fell in with.\r\n\r\nThe village was just like the one we had left, only rather larger.  The\r\nstreets were narrow and unpaved, but very fairly clean.  The vine grew\r\noutside many of the houses; and there were some with sign-boards, on\r\nwhich was painted a bottle and a glass, that made me feel much at home.\r\nEven on this ledge of human society there was a stunted growth of\r\nshoplets, which had taken root and vegetated somehow, though as in an air\r\nmercantile of the bleakest.  It was here as hitherto: all things were\r\ngenerically the same as in Europe, the differences being of species only;\r\nand I was amused at seeing in a window some bottles with barley-sugar and\r\nsweetmeats for children, as at home; but the barley-sugar was in plates,\r\nnot in twisted sticks, and was coloured blue.  Glass was plentiful in the\r\nbetter houses.\r\n\r\nLastly, I should say that the people were of a physical beauty which was\r\nsimply amazing.  I never saw anything in the least comparable to them.\r\nThe women were vigorous, and had a most majestic gait, their heads being\r\nset upon their shoulders with a grace beyond all power of expression.\r\nEach feature was finished, eyelids, eyelashes, and ears being almost\r\ninvariably perfect.  Their colour was equal to that of the finest Italian\r\npaintings; being of the clearest olive, and yet ruddy with a glow of\r\nperfect health.  Their expression was divine; and as they glanced at me\r\ntimidly but with parted lips in great bewilderment, I forgot all thoughts\r\nof their conversion in feelings that were far more earthly.  I was\r\ndazzled as I saw one after the other, of whom I could only feel that each\r\nwas the loveliest I had ever seen.  Even in middle age they were still\r\ncomely, and the old grey-haired women at their cottage doors had a\r\ndignity, not to say majesty, of their own.\r\n\r\nThe men were as handsome as the women beautiful.  I have always delighted\r\nin and reverenced beauty; but I felt simply abashed in the presence of\r\nsuch a splendid type--a compound of all that is best in Egyptian, Greek\r\nand Italian.  The children were infinite in number, and exceedingly\r\nmerry; I need hardly say that they came in for their full share of the\r\nprevailing beauty.  I expressed by signs my admiration and pleasure to my\r\nguides, and they were greatly pleased.  I should add that all seemed to\r\ntake a pride in their personal appearance, and that even the poorest (and\r\nnone seemed rich) were well kempt and tidy.  I could fill many pages with\r\na description of their dress and the ornaments which they wore, and a\r\nhundred details which struck me with all the force of novelty; but I must\r\nnot stay to do so.\r\n\r\nWhen we had got past the village the fog rose, and revealed magnificent\r\nviews of the snowy mountains and their nearer abutments, while in front I\r\ncould now and again catch glimpses of the great plains which I had\r\nsurveyed on the preceding evening.  The country was highly cultivated,\r\nevery ledge being planted with chestnuts, walnuts, and apple-trees from\r\nwhich the apples were now gathering.  Goats were abundant; also a kind of\r\nsmall black cattle, in the marshes near the river, which was now fast\r\nwidening, and running between larger flats from which the hills receded\r\nmore and more.  I saw a few sheep with rounded noses and enormous tails.\r\nDogs were there in plenty, and very English; but I saw no cats, nor\r\nindeed are these creatures known, their place being supplied by a sort of\r\nsmall terrier.\r\n\r\nIn about four hours of walking from the time we started, and after\r\npassing two or three more villages, we came upon a considerable town, and\r\nmy guides made many attempts to make me understand something, but I\r\ngathered no inkling of their meaning, except that I need be under no\r\napprehension of danger.  I will spare the reader any description of the\r\ntown, and would only bid him think of Domodossola or Faido.  Suffice it\r\nthat I found myself taken before the chief magistrate, and by his orders\r\nwas placed in an apartment with two other people, who were the first I\r\nhad seen looking anything but well and handsome.  In fact, one of them\r\nwas plainly very much out of health, and coughed violently from time to\r\ntime in spite of manifest efforts to suppress it.  The other looked pale\r\nand ill but he was marvellously self-contained, and it was impossible to\r\nsay what was the matter with him.  Both of them appeared astonished at\r\nseeing one who was evidently a stranger, but they were too ill to come up\r\nto me, and form conclusions concerning me.  These two were first called\r\nout; and in about a quarter of an hour I was made to follow them, which I\r\ndid in some fear, and with much curiosity.\r\n\r\nThe chief magistrate was a venerable-looking man, with white hair and\r\nbeard and a face of great sagacity.  He looked me all over for about five\r\nminutes, letting his eyes wander from the crown of my head to the soles\r\nof my feet, up and down, and down and up; neither did his mind seem in\r\nthe least clearer when he had done looking than when he began.  He at\r\nlength asked me a single short question, which I supposed meant "Who are\r\nyou?"  I answered in English quite composedly as though he would\r\nunderstand me, and endeavoured to be my very most natural self as well as\r\nI could.  He appeared more and more puzzled, and then retired, returning\r\nwith two others much like himself.  Then they took me into an inner room,\r\nand the two fresh arrivals stripped me, while the chief looked on.  They\r\nfelt my pulse, they looked at my tongue, they listened at my chest, they\r\nfelt all my muscles; and at the end of each operation they looked at the\r\nchief and nodded, and said something in a tone quite pleasant, as though\r\nI were all right.  They even pulled down my eyelids, and looked, I\r\nsuppose, to see if they were bloodshot; but it was not so.  At length\r\nthey gave up; and I think that all were satisfied of my being in the most\r\nperfect health, and very robust to boot.  At last the old magistrate made\r\nme a speech of about five minutes long, which the other two appeared to\r\nthink greatly to the point, but from which I gathered nothing.  As soon\r\nas it was ended, they proceeded to overhaul my swag and the contents of\r\nmy pockets.  This gave me little uneasiness, for I had no money with me,\r\nnor anything which they were at all likely to want, or which I cared\r\nabout losing.  At least I fancied so, but I soon found my mistake.\r\n\r\nThey got on comfortably at first, though they were much puzzled with my\r\ntobacco-pipe and insisted on seeing me use it.  When I had shown them\r\nwhat I did with it, they were astonished but not displeased, and seemed\r\nto like the smell.  But by and by they came to my watch, which I had\r\nhidden away in the inmost pocket that I had, and had forgotten when they\r\nbegan their search.  They seemed concerned and uneasy as soon as they got\r\nhold of it.  They then made me open it and show the works; and when I had\r\ndone so they gave signs of very grave displeasure, which disturbed me all\r\nthe more because I could not conceive wherein it could have offended\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nI remember that when they first found it I had thought of Paley, and how\r\nhe tells us that a savage on seeing a watch would at once conclude that\r\nit was designed.  True, these people were not savages, but I none the\r\nless felt sure that this was the conclusion they would arrive at; and I\r\nwas thinking what a wonderfully wise man Archbishop Paley must have been,\r\nwhen I was aroused by a look of horror and dismay upon the face of the\r\nmagistrate, a look which conveyed to me the impression that he regarded\r\nmy watch not as having been designed, but rather as the designer of\r\nhimself and of the universe; or as at any rate one of the great first\r\ncauses of all things.\r\n\r\nThen it struck me that this view was quite as likely to be taken as the\r\nother by a people who had no experience of European civilisation, and I\r\nwas a little piqued with Paley for having led me so much astray; but I\r\nsoon discovered that I had misinterpreted the expression on the\r\nmagistrate\'s face, and that it was one not of fear, but hatred.  He spoke\r\nto me solemnly and sternly for two or three minutes.  Then, reflecting\r\nthat this was of no use, he caused me to be conducted through several\r\npassages into a large room, which I afterwards found was the museum of\r\nthe town, and wherein I beheld a sight which astonished me more than\r\nanything that I had yet seen.\r\n\r\nIt was filled with cases containing all manner of curiosities--such as\r\nskeletons, stuffed birds and animals, carvings in stone (whereof I saw\r\nseveral that were like those on the saddle, only smaller), but the\r\ngreater part of the room was occupied by broken machinery of all\r\ndescriptions.  The larger specimens had a case to themselves, and tickets\r\nwith writing on them in a character which I could not understand.  There\r\nwere fragments of steam engines, all broken and rusted; among them I saw\r\na cylinder and piston, a broken fly-wheel, and part of a crank, which was\r\nlaid on the ground by their side.  Again, there was a very old carriage\r\nwhose wheels in spite of rust and decay, I could see, had been designed\r\noriginally for iron rails.  Indeed, there were fragments of a great many\r\nof our own most advanced inventions; but they seemed all to be several\r\nhundred years old, and to be placed where they were, not for instruction,\r\nbut curiosity.  As I said before, all were marred and broken.\r\n\r\nWe passed many cases, and at last came to one in which there were several\r\nclocks and two or three old watches.  Here the magistrate stopped, and\r\nopening the case began comparing my watch with the others.  The design\r\nwas different, but the thing was clearly the same.  On this he turned to\r\nme and made me a speech in a severe and injured tone of voice, pointing\r\nrepeatedly to the watches in the case, and to my own; neither did he seem\r\nin the least appeased until I made signs to him that he had better take\r\nmy watch and put it with the others.  This had some effect in calming\r\nhim.  I said in English (trusting to tone and manner to convey my\r\nmeaning) that I was exceedingly sorry if I had been found to have\r\nanything contraband in my possession; that I had had no intention of\r\nevading the ordinary tolls, and that I would gladly forfeit the watch if\r\nmy doing so would atone for an unintentional violation of the law.  He\r\nbegan presently to relent, and spoke to me in a kinder manner.  I think\r\nhe saw that I had offended without knowledge; but I believe the chief\r\nthing that brought him round was my not seeming to be afraid of him,\r\nalthough I was quite respectful; this, and my having light hair and\r\ncomplexion, on which he had remarked previously by signs, as every one\r\nelse had done.\r\n\r\nI afterwards found that it was reckoned a very great merit to have fair\r\nhair, this being a thing of the rarest possible occurrence, and greatly\r\nadmired and envied in all who were possessed of it.  However that might\r\nbe, my watch was taken from me; but our peace was made, and I was\r\nconducted back to the room where I had been examined.  The magistrate\r\nthen made me another speech, whereon I was taken to a building hard by,\r\nwhich I soon discovered to be the common prison of the town, but in which\r\nan apartment was assigned me separate from the other prisoners.  The room\r\ncontained a bed, table, and chairs, also a fireplace and a washing-stand.\r\nThere was another door, which opened on to a balcony, with a flight of\r\nsteps descending into a walled garden of some size.  The man who\r\nconducted me into this room made signs to me that I might go down and\r\nwalk in the garden whenever I pleased, and intimated that I should\r\nshortly have something brought me to eat.  I was allowed to retain my\r\nblankets, and the few things which I had wrapped inside them, but it was\r\nplain that I was to consider myself a prisoner--for how long a period I\r\ncould not by any means determine.  He then left me alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII: IN PRISON\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now for the first time my courage completely failed me.  It is enough\r\nto say that I was penniless, and a prisoner in a foreign country, where I\r\nhad no friend, nor any knowledge of the customs or language of the\r\npeople.  I was at the mercy of men with whom I had little in common.  And\r\nyet, engrossed as I was with my extremely difficult and doubtful\r\nposition, I could not help feeling deeply interested in the people among\r\nwhom I had fallen.  What was the meaning of that room full of old\r\nmachinery which I had just seen, and of the displeasure with which the\r\nmagistrate had regarded my watch?  The people had very little machinery\r\nnow.  I had been struck with this over and over again, though I had not\r\nbeen more than four-and-twenty hours in the country.  They were about as\r\nfar advanced as Europeans of the twelfth or thirteenth century; certainly\r\nnot more so.  And yet they must have had at one time the fullest\r\nknowledge of our own most recent inventions.  How could it have happened\r\nthat having been once so far in advance they were now as much behind us?\r\nIt was evident that it was not from ignorance.  They knew my watch as a\r\nwatch when they saw it; and the care with which the broken machines were\r\npreserved and ticketed, proved that they had not lost the recollection of\r\ntheir former civilisation.  The more I thought, the less I could\r\nunderstand it; but at last I concluded that they must have worked out\r\ntheir mines of coal and iron, till either none were left, or so few, that\r\nthe use of these metals was restricted to the very highest nobility.  This\r\nwas the only solution I could think of; and, though I afterwards found\r\nhow entirely mistaken it was, I felt quite sure then that it must be the\r\nright one.\r\n\r\nI had hardly arrived at this opinion for above four or five minutes, when\r\nthe door opened, and a young woman made her appearance with a tray, and a\r\nvery appetising smell of dinner.  I gazed upon her with admiration as she\r\nlaid a cloth and set a savoury-looking dish upon the table.  As I beheld\r\nher I felt as though my position was already much ameliorated, for the\r\nvery sight of her carried great comfort.  She was not more than twenty,\r\nrather above the middle height, active and strong, but yet most\r\ndelicately featured; her lips were full and sweet; her eyes were of a\r\ndeep hazel, and fringed with long and springing eyelashes; her hair was\r\nneatly braided from off her forehead; her complexion was simply\r\nexquisite; her figure as robust as was consistent with the most perfect\r\nfemale beauty, yet not more so; her hands and feet might have served as\r\nmodels to a sculptor.  Having set the stew upon the table, she retired\r\nwith a glance of pity, whereon (remembering pity\'s kinsman) I decided\r\nthat she should pity me a little more.  She returned with a bottle and a\r\nglass, and found me sitting on the bed with my hands over my face,\r\nlooking the very picture of abject misery, and, like all pictures, rather\r\nuntruthful.  As I watched her, through my fingers, out of the room again,\r\nI felt sure that she was exceedingly sorry for me.  Her back being\r\nturned, I set to work and ate my dinner, which was excellent.\r\n\r\nShe returned in about an hour to take away; and there came with her a man\r\nwho had a great bunch of keys at his waist, and whose manner convinced me\r\nthat he was the jailor.  I afterwards found that he was father to the\r\nbeautiful creature who had brought me my dinner.  I am not a much greater\r\nhypocrite than other people, and do what I would, I could not look so\r\nvery miserable.  I had already recovered from my dejection, and felt in a\r\nmost genial humour both with my jailor and his daughter.  I thanked them\r\nfor their attention towards me; and, though they could not understand,\r\nthey looked at one another and laughed and chattered till the old man\r\nsaid something or other which I suppose was a joke; for the girl laughed\r\nmerrily and ran away, leaving her father to take away the dinner things.\r\nThen I had another visitor, who was not so prepossessing, and who seemed\r\nto have a great idea of himself and a small one of me.  He brought a book\r\nwith him, and pens and paper--all very English; and yet, neither paper,\r\nnor printing, nor binding, nor pen, nor ink, were quite the same as ours.\r\n\r\nHe gave me to understand that he was to teach me the language and that we\r\nwere to begin at once.  This delighted me, both because I should be more\r\ncomfortable when I could understand and make myself understood, and\r\nbecause I supposed that the authorities would hardly teach me the\r\nlanguage if they intended any cruel usage towards me afterwards.  We\r\nbegan at once, and I learnt the names of everything in the room, and also\r\nthe numerals and personal pronouns.  I found to my sorrow that the\r\nresemblance to European things, which I had so frequently observed\r\nhitherto, did not hold good in the matter of language; for I could detect\r\nno analogy whatever between this and any tongue of which I have the\r\nslightest knowledge,--a thing which made me think it possible that I\r\nmight be learning Hebrew.\r\n\r\nI must detail no longer; from this time my days were spent with a\r\nmonotony which would have been tedious but for the society of Yram, the\r\njailor\'s daughter, who had taken a great fancy for me and treated me with\r\nthe utmost kindness.  The man came every day to teach me the language,\r\nbut my real dictionary and grammar were Yram; and I consulted them to\r\nsuch purpose that I made the most extraordinary progress, being able at\r\nthe end of a month to understand a great deal of the conversation which I\r\noverheard between Yram and her father.  My teacher professed himself well\r\nsatisfied, and said he should make a favourable report of me to the\r\nauthorities.  I then questioned him as to what would probably be done\r\nwith me.  He told me that my arrival had caused great excitement\r\nthroughout the country, and that I was to be detained a close prisoner\r\nuntil the receipt of advices from the Government.  My having had a watch,\r\nhe said, was the only damaging feature in the case.  And then, in answer\r\nto my asking why this should be so, he gave me a long story of which with\r\nmy imperfect knowledge of the language I could make nothing whatever,\r\nexcept that it was a very heinous offence, almost as bad (at least, so I\r\nthought I understood him) as having typhus fever.  But he said he thought\r\nmy light hair would save me.\r\n\r\nI was allowed to walk in the garden; there was a high wall so that I\r\nmanaged to play a sort of hand fives, which prevented my feeling the bad\r\neffects of my confinement, though it was stupid work playing alone.  In\r\nthe course of time people from the town and neighbourhood began to pester\r\nthe jailor to be allowed to see me, and on receiving handsome fees he let\r\nthem do so.  The people were good to me; almost too good, for they were\r\ninclined to make a lion of me, which I hated--at least the women were;\r\nonly they had to beware of Yram, who was a young lady of a jealous\r\ntemperament, and kept a sharp eye both on me and on my lady visitors.\r\nHowever, I felt so kindly towards her, and was so entirely dependent upon\r\nher for almost all that made my life a blessing and a comfort to me, that\r\nI took good care not to vex her, and we remained excellent friends.  The\r\nmen were far less inquisitive, and would not, I believe, have come near\r\nme of their own accord; but the women made them come as escorts.  I was\r\ndelighted with their handsome mien, and pleasant genial manners.\r\n\r\nMy food was plain, but always varied and wholesome, and the good red wine\r\nwas admirable.  I had found a sort of wort in the garden, which I sweated\r\nin heaps and then dried, obtaining thus a substitute for tobacco; so that\r\nwhat with Yram, the language, visitors, fives in the garden, smoking, and\r\nbed, my time slipped by more rapidly and pleasantly than might have been\r\nexpected.  I also made myself a small flute; and being a tolerable\r\nplayer, amused myself at times with playing snatches from operas, and\r\nairs such as "O where and oh where," and "Home, sweet home."  This was of\r\ngreat advantage to me, for the people of the country were ignorant of the\r\ndiatonic scale and could hardly believe their ears on hearing some of our\r\nmost common melodies.  Often, too, they would make me sing; and I could\r\nat any time make Yram\'s eyes swim with tears by singing "Wilkins and his\r\nDinah," "Billy Taylor," "The Ratcatcher\'s Daughter," or as much of them\r\nas I could remember.\r\n\r\nI had one or two discussions with them because I never would sing on\r\nSunday (of which I kept count in my pocket-book), except chants and hymn\r\ntunes; of these I regret to say that I had forgotten the words, so that I\r\ncould only sing the tune.  They appeared to have little or no religious\r\nfeeling, and to have never so much as heard of the divine institution of\r\nthe Sabbath, so they ascribed my observance of it to a fit of sulkiness,\r\nwhich they remarked as coming over me upon every seventh day.  But they\r\nwere very tolerant, and one of them said to me quite kindly that she knew\r\nhow impossible it was to help being sulky at times, only she thought I\r\nought to see some one if it became more serious--a piece of advice which\r\nI then failed to understand, though I pretended to take it quite as a\r\nmatter of course.\r\n\r\nOnce only did Yram treat me in a way that was unkind and unreasonable,--at\r\nleast so I thought it at the time.  It happened thus.  I had been playing\r\nfives in the garden and got much heated.  Although the day was cold, for\r\nautumn was now advancing, and Cold Harbour (as the name of the town in\r\nwhich my prison was should be translated) stood fully 3000 feet above the\r\nsea, I had played without my coat and waistcoat, and took a sharp chill\r\non resting myself too long in the open air without protection.  The next\r\nday I had a severe cold and felt really poorly.  Being little used even\r\nto the lightest ailments, and thinking that it would be rather nice to be\r\npetted and cossetted by Yram, I certainly did not make myself out to be\r\nany better than I was; in fact, I remember that I made the worst of\r\nthings, and took it into my head to consider myself upon the sick list.\r\nWhen Yram brought me my breakfast I complained somewhat dolefully of my\r\nindisposition, expecting the sympathy and humouring which I should have\r\nreceived from my mother and sisters at home.  Not a bit of it.  She fired\r\nup in an instant, and asked me what I meant by it, and how I dared to\r\npresume to mention such a thing, especially when I considered in what\r\nplace I was.  She had the best mind to tell her father, only that she was\r\nafraid the consequences would be so very serious for me.  Her manner was\r\nso injured and decided, and her anger so evidently unfeigned, that I\r\nforgot my cold upon the spot, begging her by all means to tell her father\r\nif she wished to do so, and telling her that I had no idea of being\r\nshielded by her from anything whatever; presently mollifying, after\r\nhaving said as many biting things as I could, I asked her what it was\r\nthat I had done amiss, and promised amendment as soon as ever I became\r\naware of it.  She saw that I was really ignorant, and had had no\r\nintention of being rude to her; whereon it came out that illness of any\r\nsort was considered in Erewhon to be highly criminal and immoral; and\r\nthat I was liable, even for catching cold, to be had up before the\r\nmagistrates and imprisoned for a considerable period--an announcement\r\nwhich struck me dumb with astonishment.\r\n\r\nI followed up the conversation as well as my imperfect knowledge of the\r\nlanguage would allow, and caught a glimmering of her position with regard\r\nto ill-health; but I did not even then fully comprehend it, nor had I as\r\nyet any idea of the other extraordinary perversions of thought which\r\nexisted among the Erewhonians, but with which I was soon to become\r\nfamiliar.  I propose, therefore, to make no mention of what passed\r\nbetween us on this occasion, save that we were reconciled, and that she\r\nbrought me surreptitiously a hot glass of spirits and water before I went\r\nto bed, as also a pile of extra blankets, and that next morning I was\r\nquite well.  I never remember to have lost a cold so rapidly.\r\n\r\nThis little affair explained much which had hitherto puzzled me.  It\r\nseemed that the two men who were examined before the magistrates on the\r\nday of my arrival in the country, had been given in charge on account of\r\nill health, and were both condemned to a long term of imprisonment with\r\nhard labour; they were now expiating their offence in this very prison,\r\nand their exercise ground was a yard separated by my fives wall from the\r\ngarden in which I walked.  This accounted for the sounds of coughing and\r\ngroaning which I had often noticed as coming from the other side of the\r\nwall: it was high, and I had not dared to climb it for fear the jailor\r\nshould see me and think that I was trying to escape; but I had often\r\nwondered what sort of people they could be on the other side, and had\r\nresolved on asking the jailor; but I seldom saw him, and Yram and I\r\ngenerally found other things to talk about.\r\n\r\nAnother month flew by, during which I made such progress in the language\r\nthat I could understand all that was said to me, and express myself with\r\ntolerable fluency.  My instructor professed to be astonished with the\r\nprogress I had made; I was careful to attribute it to the pains he had\r\ntaken with me and to his admirable method of explaining my difficulties,\r\nso we became excellent friends.\r\n\r\nMy visitors became more and more frequent.  Among them there were some,\r\nboth men and women, who delighted me entirely by their simplicity,\r\nunconsciousness of self, kindly genial manners, and last, but not least,\r\nby their exquisite beauty; there came others less well-bred, but still\r\ncomely and agreeable people, while some were snobs pure and simple.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the third month the jailor and my instructor came together\r\nto visit me and told me that communications had been received from the\r\nGovernment to the effect that if I had behaved well and seemed generally\r\nreasonable, and if there could be no suspicion at all about my bodily\r\nhealth and vigour, and if my hair was really light, and my eyes blue and\r\ncomplexion fresh, I was to be sent up at once to the metropolis in order\r\nthat the King and Queen might see me and converse with me; but that when\r\nI arrived there I should be set at liberty, and a suitable allowance\r\nwould be made me.  My teacher also told me that one of the leading\r\nmerchants had sent me an invitation to repair to his house and to\r\nconsider myself his guest for as long a time as I chose.  "He is a\r\ndelightful man," continued the interpreter, "but has suffered terribly\r\nfrom" (here there came a long word which I could not quite catch, only it\r\nwas much longer than kleptomania), "and has but lately recovered from\r\nembezzling a large sum of money under singularly distressing\r\ncircumstances; but he has quite got over it, and the straighteners say\r\nthat he has made a really wonderful recovery; you are sure to like him."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX: TO THE METROPOLIS\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the above words the good man left the room before I had time to\r\nexpress my astonishment at hearing such extraordinary language from the\r\nlips of one who seemed to be a reputable member of society.  "Embezzle a\r\nlarge sum of money under singularly distressing circumstances!" I\r\nexclaimed to myself, "and ask _me_ to go and stay with him!  I shall do\r\nnothing of the sort--compromise myself at the very outset in the eyes of\r\nall decent people, and give the death-blow to my chances of either\r\nconverting them if they are the lost tribes of Israel, or making money\r\nout of them if they are not!  No.  I will do anything rather than that."\r\nAnd when I next saw my teacher I told him that I did not at all like the\r\nsound of what had been proposed for me, and that I would have nothing to\r\ndo with it.  For by my education and the example of my own parents, and I\r\ntrust also in some degree from inborn instinct, I have a very genuine\r\ndislike for all unhandsome dealings in money matters, though none can\r\nhave a greater regard for money than I have, if it be got fairly.\r\n\r\nThe interpreter was much surprised by my answer, and said that I should\r\nbe very foolish if I persisted in my refusal.\r\n\r\nMr. Nosnibor, he continued, "is a man of at least 500,000 horse-power"\r\n(for their way of reckoning and classifying men is by the number of foot\r\npounds which they have money enough to raise, or more roughly by their\r\nhorse-power), "and keeps a capital table; besides, his two daughters are\r\namong the most beautiful women in Erewhon."\r\n\r\nWhen I heard all this, I confess that I was much shaken, and inquired\r\nwhether he was favourably considered in the best society.\r\n\r\n"Certainly," was the answer; "no man in the country stands higher."\r\n\r\nHe then went on to say that one would have thought from my manner that my\r\nproposed host had had jaundice or pleurisy or been generally unfortunate,\r\nand that I was in fear of infection.\r\n\r\n"I am not much afraid of infection," said I, impatiently, "but I have\r\nsome regard for my character; and if I know a man to be an embezzler of\r\nother people\'s money, be sure of it, I will give him as wide a berth as I\r\ncan.  If he were ill or poor--"\r\n\r\n"Ill or poor!" interrupted the interpreter, with a face of great alarm.\r\n"So that\'s your notion of propriety!  You would consort with the basest\r\ncriminals, and yet deem simple embezzlement a bar to friendly\r\nintercourse.  I cannot understand you."\r\n\r\n"But I am poor myself," cried I.\r\n\r\n"You were," said he; "and you were liable to be severely punished for\r\nit,--indeed, at the council which was held concerning you, this fact was\r\nvery nearly consigning you to what I should myself consider a\r\nwell-deserved chastisement" (for he was getting angry, and so was I);\r\n"but the Queen was so inquisitive, and wanted so much to see you, that\r\nshe petitioned the King and made him give you his pardon, and assign you\r\na pension in consideration of your meritorious complexion.  It is lucky\r\nfor you that he has not heard what you have been saying now, or he would\r\nbe sure to cancel it."\r\n\r\nAs I heard these words my heart sank within me.  I felt the extreme\r\ndifficulty of my position, and how wicked I should be in running counter\r\nto established usage.  I remained silent for several minutes, and then\r\nsaid that I should be happy to accept the embezzler\'s invitation,--on\r\nwhich my instructor brightened and said I was a sensible fellow.  But I\r\nfelt very uncomfortable.  When he had left the room, I mused over the\r\nconversation which had just taken place between us, but I could make\r\nnothing out of it, except that it argued an even greater perversity of\r\nmental vision than I had been yet prepared for.  And this made me\r\nwretched; for I cannot bear having much to do with people who think\r\ndifferently from myself.  All sorts of wandering thoughts kept coming\r\ninto my head.  I thought of my master\'s hut, and my seat upon the\r\nmountain side, where I had first conceived the insane idea of exploring.\r\nWhat years and years seemed to have passed since I had begun my journey!\r\n\r\nI thought of my adventures in the gorge, and on the journey hither, and\r\nof Chowbok.  I wondered what Chowbok told them about me when he got\r\nback,--he had done well in going back, Chowbok had.  He was not\r\nhandsome--nay, he was hideous; and it would have gone hardly with him.\r\nTwilight drew on, and rain pattered against the windows.  Never yet had I\r\nfelt so unhappy, except during three days of sea-sickness at the\r\nbeginning of my voyage from England.  I sat musing and in great\r\nmelancholy, until Yram made her appearance with light and supper.  She\r\ntoo, poor girl, was miserable; for she had heard that I was to leave\r\nthem.  She had made up her mind that I was to remain always in the town,\r\neven after my imprisonment was over; and I fancy had resolved to marry me\r\nthough I had never so much as hinted at her doing so.  So what with the\r\ndistressingly strange conversation with my teacher, my own friendless\r\ncondition, and Yram\'s melancholy, I felt more unhappy than I can\r\ndescribe, and remained so till I got to bed, and sleep sealed my eyelids.\r\n\r\nOn awaking next morning I was much better.  It was settled that I was to\r\nmake my start in a conveyance which was to be in waiting for me at about\r\neleven o\'clock; and the anticipation of change put me in good spirits,\r\nwhich even the tearful face of Yram could hardly altogether derange.  I\r\nkissed her again and again, assured her that we should meet hereafter,\r\nand that in the meanwhile I should be ever mindful of her kindness.  I\r\ngave her two of the buttons off my coat and a lock of my hair as a\r\nkeepsake, taking a goodly curl from her own beautiful head in return: and\r\nso, having said good-bye a hundred times, till I was fairly overcome with\r\nher great sweetness and her sorrow, I tore myself away from her and got\r\ndown-stairs to the caleche which was in waiting.  How thankful I was when\r\nit was all over, and I was driven away and out of sight.  Would that I\r\ncould have felt that it was out of mind also!  Pray heaven that it is so\r\nnow, and that she is married happily among her own people, and has\r\nforgotten me!\r\n\r\nAnd now began a long and tedious journey with which I should hardly\r\ntrouble the reader if I could.  He is safe, however, for the simple\r\nreason that I was blindfolded during the greater part of the time.  A\r\nbandage was put upon my eyes every morning, and was only removed at night\r\nwhen I reached the inn at which we were to pass the night.  We travelled\r\nslowly, although the roads were good.  We drove but one horse, which took\r\nus our day\'s journey from morning till evening, about six hours,\r\nexclusive of two hours\' rest in the middle of the day.  I do not suppose\r\nwe made above thirty or thirty-five miles on an average.  Each day we had\r\na fresh horse.  As I have said already, I could see nothing of the\r\ncountry.  I only know that it was level, and that several times we had to\r\ncross large rivers in ferry-boats.  The inns were clean and comfortable.\r\nIn one or two of the larger towns they were quite sumptuous, and the food\r\nwas good and well cooked.  The same wonderful health and grace and beauty\r\nprevailed everywhere.\r\n\r\nI found myself an object of great interest; so much so, that the driver\r\ntold me he had to keep our route secret, and at times to go to places\r\nthat were not directly on our road, in order to avoid the press that\r\nwould otherwise have awaited us.  Every evening I had a reception, and\r\ngrew heartily tired of having to say the same things over and over again\r\nin answer to the same questions, but it was impossible to be angry with\r\npeople whose manners were so delightful.  They never once asked after my\r\nhealth, or even whether I was fatigued with my journey; but their first\r\nquestion was almost invariably an inquiry after my temper, the _naivete_\r\nof which astonished me till I became used to it.  One day, being tired\r\nand cold, and weary of saying the same thing over and over again, I\r\nturned a little brusquely on my questioner and said that I was\r\nexceedingly cross, and that I could hardly feel in a worse humour with\r\nmyself and every one else than at that moment.  To my surprise, I was met\r\nwith the kindest expressions of condolence, and heard it buzzed about the\r\nroom that I was in an ill temper; whereon people began to give me nice\r\nthings to smell and to eat, which really did seem to have some temper-\r\nmending quality about them, for I soon felt pleased and was at once\r\ncongratulated upon being better.  The next morning two or three people\r\nsent their servants to the hotel with sweetmeats, and inquiries whether I\r\nhad quite recovered from my ill humour.  On receiving the good things I\r\nfelt in half a mind to be ill-tempered every evening; but I disliked the\r\ncondolences and the inquiries, and found it most comfortable to keep my\r\nnatural temper, which is smooth enough generally.\r\n\r\nAmong those who came to visit me were some who had received a liberal\r\neducation at the Colleges of Unreason, and taken the highest degrees in\r\nhypothetics, which are their principal study.  These gentlemen had now\r\nsettled down to various employments in the country, as straighteners,\r\nmanagers and cashiers of the Musical Banks, priests of religion, or what\r\nnot, and carrying their education with them they diffused a leaven of\r\nculture throughout the country.  I naturally questioned them about many\r\nof the things which had puzzled me since my arrival.  I inquired what was\r\nthe object and meaning of the statues which I had seen upon the plateau\r\nof the pass.  I was told that they dated from a very remote period, and\r\nthat there were several other such groups in the country, but none so\r\nremarkable as the one which I had seen.  They had a religious origin,\r\nhaving been designed to propitiate the gods of deformity and disease.  In\r\nformer times it had been the custom to make expeditions over the ranges,\r\nand capture the ugliest of Chowbok\'s ancestors whom they could find, in\r\norder to sacrifice them in the presence of these deities, and thus avert\r\nugliness and disease from the Erewhonians themselves.  It had been\r\nwhispered (but my informant assured me untruly) that centuries ago they\r\nhad even offered up some of their own people who were ugly or out of\r\nhealth, in order to make examples of them; these detestable customs,\r\nhowever, had been long discontinued; neither was there any present\r\nobservance of the statues.\r\n\r\nI had the curiosity to inquire what would be done to any of Chowbok\'s\r\ntribe if they crossed over into Erewhon.  I was told that nobody knew,\r\ninasmuch as such a thing had not happened for ages.  They would be too\r\nugly to be allowed to go at large, but not so much so as to be criminally\r\nliable.  Their offence in having come would be a moral one; but they\r\nwould be beyond the straightener\'s art.  Possibly they would be consigned\r\nto the Hospital for Incurable Bores, and made to work at being bored for\r\nso many hours a day by the Erewhonian inhabitants of the hospital, who\r\nare extremely impatient of one another\'s boredom, but would soon die if\r\nthey had no one whom they might bore--in fact, that they would be kept as\r\nprofessional borees.  When I heard this, it occurred to me that some\r\nrumours of its substance might perhaps have become current among\r\nChowbok\'s people; for the agony of his fear had been too great to have\r\nbeen inspired by the mere dread of being burnt alive before the statues.\r\n\r\nI also questioned them about the museum of old machines, and the cause of\r\nthe apparent retrogression in all arts, sciences, and inventions.  I\r\nlearnt that about four hundred years previously, the state of mechanical\r\nknowledge was far beyond our own, and was advancing with prodigious\r\nrapidity, until one of the most learned professors of hypothetics wrote\r\nan extraordinary book (from which I propose to give extracts later on),\r\nproving that the machines were ultimately destined to supplant the race\r\nof man, and to become instinct with a vitality as different from, and\r\nsuperior to, that of animals, as animal to vegetable life.  So convincing\r\nwas his reasoning, or unreasoning, to this effect, that he carried the\r\ncountry with him; and they made a clean sweep of all machinery that had\r\nnot been in use for more than two hundred and seventy-one years (which\r\nperiod was arrived at after a series of compromises), and strictly\r\nforbade all further improvements and inventions under pain of being\r\nconsidered in the eye of the law to be labouring under typhus fever,\r\nwhich they regard as one of the worst of all crimes.\r\n\r\nThis is the only case in which they have confounded mental and physical\r\ndiseases, and they do it even here as by an avowed legal fiction.  I\r\nbecame uneasy when I remembered about my watch; but they comforted me\r\nwith the assurance that transgression in this matter was now so unheard\r\nof, that the law could afford to be lenient towards an utter stranger,\r\nespecially towards one who had such a good character (they meant\r\nphysique), and such beautiful light hair.  Moreover the watch was a real\r\ncuriosity, and would be a welcome addition to the metropolitan\r\ncollection; so they did not think I need let it trouble me seriously.\r\n\r\nI will write, however, more fully upon this subject when I deal with the\r\nColleges of Unreason, and the Book of the Machines.\r\n\r\nIn about a month from the time of our starting I was told that our\r\njourney was nearly over.  The bandage was now dispensed with, for it\r\nseemed impossible that I should ever be able to find my way back without\r\nbeing captured.  Then we rolled merrily along through the streets of a\r\nhandsome town, and got on to a long, broad, and level road, with poplar\r\ntrees on either side.  The road was raised slightly above the surrounding\r\ncountry, and had formerly been a railway; the fields on either side were\r\nin the highest conceivable cultivation, but the harvest and also the\r\nvintage had been already gathered.  The weather had got cooler more\r\nrapidly than could be quite accounted for by the progress of the season;\r\nso I rather thought that we must have been making away from the sun, and\r\nwere some degrees farther from the equator than when we started.  Even\r\nhere the vegetation showed that the climate was a hot one, yet there was\r\nno lack of vigour among the people; on the contrary, they were a very\r\nhardy race, and capable of great endurance.  For the hundredth time I\r\nthought that, take them all round, I had never seen their equals in\r\nrespect of physique, and they looked as good-natured as they were robust.\r\nThe flowers were for the most part over, but their absence was in some\r\nmeasure compensated for by a profusion of delicious fruit, closely\r\nresembling the figs, peaches, and pears of Italy and France.  I saw no\r\nwild animals, but birds were plentiful and much as in Europe, but not\r\ntame as they had been on the other side the ranges.  They were shot at\r\nwith the cross-bow and with arrows, gunpowder being unknown, or at any\r\nrate not in use.\r\n\r\nWe were now nearing the metropolis and I could see great towers and\r\nfortifications, and lofty buildings that looked like palaces.  I began to\r\nbe nervous as to my reception; but I had got on very well so far, and\r\nresolved to continue upon the same plan as hitherto--namely, to behave\r\njust as though I were in England until I saw that I was making a blunder,\r\nand then to say nothing till I could gather how the land lay.  We drew\r\nnearer and nearer.  The news of my approach had got abroad, and there was\r\na great crowd collected on either side the road, who greeted me with\r\nmarks of most respectful curiosity, keeping me bowing constantly in\r\nacknowledgement from side to side.\r\n\r\nWhen we were about a mile off, we were met by the Mayor and several\r\nCouncillors, among whom was a venerable old man, who was introduced to me\r\nby the Mayor (for so I suppose I should call him) as the gentleman who\r\nhad invited me to his house.  I bowed deeply and told him how grateful I\r\nfelt to him, and how gladly I would accept his hospitality.  He forbade\r\nme to say more, and pointing to his carriage, which was close at hand, he\r\nmotioned me to a seat therein.  I again bowed profoundly to the Mayor and\r\nCouncillors, and drove off with my entertainer, whose name was Senoj\r\nNosnibor.  After about half a mile the carriage turned off the main road,\r\nand we drove under the walls of the town till we reached a _palazzo_ on a\r\nslight eminence, and just on the outskirts of the city.  This was Senoj\r\nNosnibor\'s house, and nothing can be imagined finer.  It was situated\r\nnear the magnificent and venerable ruins of the old railway station,\r\nwhich formed an imposing feature from the gardens of the house.  The\r\ngrounds, some ten or a dozen acres in extent, were laid out in terraced\r\ngardens, one above the other, with flights of broad steps ascending and\r\ndescending the declivity of the garden.  On these steps there were\r\nstatues of most exquisite workmanship.  Besides the statues there were\r\nvases filled with various shrubs that were new to me; and on either side\r\nthe flights of steps there were rows of old cypresses and cedars, with\r\ngrassy alleys between them.  Then came choice vineyards and orchards of\r\nfruit-trees in full bearing.\r\n\r\nThe house itself was approached by a court-yard, and round it was a\r\ncorridor on to which rooms opened, as at Pompeii.  In the middle of the\r\ncourt there was a bath and a fountain.  Having passed the court we came\r\nto the main body of the house, which was two stories in height.  The\r\nrooms were large and lofty; perhaps at first they looked rather bare of\r\nfurniture, but in hot climates people generally keep their rooms more\r\nbare than they do in colder ones.  I missed also the sight of a grand\r\npiano or some similar instrument, there being no means of producing music\r\nin any of the rooms save the larger drawing-room, where there were half a\r\ndozen large bronze gongs, which the ladies used occasionally to beat\r\nabout at random.  It was not pleasant to hear them, but I have heard\r\nquite as unpleasant music both before and since.\r\n\r\nMr. Nosnibor took me through several spacious rooms till we reached a\r\nboudoir where were his wife and daughters, of whom I had heard from the\r\ninterpreter.  Mrs. Nosnibor was about forty years old, and still\r\nhandsome, but she had grown very stout: her daughters were in the prime\r\nof youth and exquisitely beautiful.  I gave the preference almost at once\r\nto the younger, whose name was Arowhena; for the elder sister was\r\nhaughty, while the younger had a very winning manner.  Mrs. Nosnibor\r\nreceived me with the perfection of courtesy, so that I must have indeed\r\nbeen shy and nervous if I had not at once felt welcome.  Scarcely was the\r\nceremony of my introduction well completed before a servant announced\r\nthat dinner was ready in the next room.  I was exceedingly hungry, and\r\nthe dinner was beyond all praise.  Can the reader wonder that I began to\r\nconsider myself in excellent quarters?  "That man embezzle money?"\r\nthought I to myself; "impossible."\r\n\r\nBut I noticed that my host was uneasy during the whole meal, and that he\r\nate nothing but a little bread and milk; towards the end of dinner there\r\ncame a tall lean man with a black beard, to whom Mr. Nosnibor and the\r\nwhole family paid great attention: he was the family straightener.  With\r\nthis gentleman Mr. Nosnibor retired into another room, from which there\r\npresently proceeded a sound of weeping and wailing.  I could hardly\r\nbelieve my ears, but in a few minutes I got to know for a certainty that\r\nthey came from Mr. Nosnibor himself.\r\n\r\n"Poor papa," said Arowhena, as she helped herself composedly to the salt,\r\n"how terribly he has suffered."\r\n\r\n"Yes," answered her mother; "but I think he is quite out of danger now."\r\n\r\nThen they went on to explain to me the circumstances of the case, and the\r\ntreatment which the straightener had prescribed, and how successful he\r\nhad been--all which I will reserve for another chapter, and put rather in\r\nthe form of a general summary of the opinions current upon these subjects\r\nthan in the exact words in which the facts were delivered to me; the\r\nreader, however, is earnestly requested to believe that both in this next\r\nchapter and in those that follow it I have endeavoured to adhere most\r\nconscientiously to the strictest accuracy, and that I have never\r\nwillingly misrepresented, though I may have sometimes failed to\r\nunderstand all the bearings of an opinion or custom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X: CURRENT OPINIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is what I gathered.  That in that country if a man falls into ill\r\nhealth, or catches any disorder, or fails bodily in any way before he is\r\nseventy years old, he is tried before a jury of his countrymen, and if\r\nconvicted is held up to public scorn and sentenced more or less severely\r\nas the case may be.  There are subdivisions of illnesses into crimes and\r\nmisdemeanours as with offences amongst ourselves--a man being punished\r\nvery heavily for serious illness, while failure of eyes or hearing in one\r\nover sixty-five, who has had good health hitherto, is dealt with by fine\r\nonly, or imprisonment in default of payment.  But if a man forges a\r\ncheque, or sets his house on fire, or robs with violence from the person,\r\nor does any other such things as are criminal in our own country, he is\r\neither taken to a hospital and most carefully tended at the public\r\nexpense, or if he is in good circumstances, he lets it be known to all\r\nhis friends that he is suffering from a severe fit of immorality, just as\r\nwe do when we are ill, and they come and visit him with great solicitude,\r\nand inquire with interest how it all came about, what symptoms first\r\nshowed themselves, and so forth,--questions which he will answer with\r\nperfect unreserve; for bad conduct, though considered no less deplorable\r\nthan illness with ourselves, and as unquestionably indicating something\r\nseriously wrong with the individual who misbehaves, is nevertheless held\r\nto be the result of either pre-natal or post-natal misfortune.\r\n\r\nThe strange part of the story, however, is that though they ascribe moral\r\ndefects to the effect of misfortune either in character or surroundings,\r\nthey will not listen to the plea of misfortune in cases that in England\r\nmeet with sympathy and commiseration only.  Ill luck of any kind, or even\r\nill treatment at the hands of others, is considered an offence against\r\nsociety, inasmuch as it makes people uncomfortable to hear of it.  Loss\r\nof fortune, therefore, or loss of some dear friend on whom another was\r\nmuch dependent, is punished hardly less severely than physical\r\ndelinquency.\r\n\r\nForeign, indeed, as such ideas are to our own, traces of somewhat similar\r\nopinions can be found even in nineteenth-century England.  If a person\r\nhas an abscess, the medical man will say that it contains "peccant"\r\nmatter, and people say that they have a "bad" arm or finger, or that they\r\nare very "bad" all over, when they only mean "diseased."  Among foreign\r\nnations Erewhonian opinions may be still more clearly noted.  The\r\nMahommedans, for example, to this day, send their female prisoners to\r\nhospitals, and the New Zealand Maories visit any misfortune with forcible\r\nentry into the house of the offender, and the breaking up and burning of\r\nall his goods.  The Italians, again, use the same word for "disgrace" and\r\n"misfortune."  I once heard an Italian lady speak of a young friend whom\r\nshe described as endowed with every virtue under heaven, "ma," she\r\nexclaimed, "povero disgraziato, ha ammazzato suo zio."  ("Poor\r\nunfortunate fellow, he has murdered his uncle.")\r\n\r\nOn mentioning this, which I heard when taken to Italy as a boy by my\r\nfather, the person to whom I told it showed no surprise.  He said that he\r\nhad been driven for two or three years in a certain city by a young\r\nSicilian cabdriver of prepossessing manners and appearance, but then lost\r\nsight of him.  On asking what had become of him, he was told that he was\r\nin prison for having shot at his father with intent to kill him--happily\r\nwithout serious result.  Some years later my informant again found\r\nhimself warmly accosted by the prepossessing young cabdriver.  "Ah, caro\r\nsignore," he exclaimed, "sono cinque anni che non lo vedo--tre anni di\r\nmilitare, e due anni di disgrazia," &c.  ("My dear sir, it is five years\r\nsince I saw you--three years of military service, and two of\r\nmisfortune")--during which last the poor fellow had been in prison.  Of\r\nmoral sense he showed not so much as a trace.  He and his father were now\r\non excellent terms, and were likely to remain so unless either of them\r\nshould again have the misfortune mortally to offend the other.\r\n\r\nIn the following chapter I will give a few examples of the way in which\r\nwhat we should call misfortune, hardship, or disease are dealt with by\r\nthe Erewhonians, but for the moment will return to their treatment of\r\ncases that with us are criminal.  As I have already said, these, though\r\nnot judicially punishable, are recognised as requiring correction.\r\nAccordingly, there exists a class of men trained in soul-craft, whom they\r\ncall straighteners, as nearly as I can translate a word which literally\r\nmeans "one who bends back the crooked."  These men practise much as\r\nmedical men in England, and receive a quasi-surreptitious fee on every\r\nvisit.  They are treated with the same unreserve, and obeyed as readily,\r\nas our own doctors--that is to say, on the whole sufficiently--because\r\npeople know that it is their interest to get well as soon as they can,\r\nand that they will not be scouted as they would be if their bodies were\r\nout of order, even though they may have to undergo a very painful course\r\nof treatment.\r\n\r\nWhen I say that they will not be scouted, I do not mean that an\r\nErewhonian will suffer no social inconvenience in consequence, we will\r\nsay, of having committed fraud.  Friends will fall away from him because\r\nof his being less pleasant company, just as we ourselves are disinclined\r\nto make companions of those who are either poor or poorly.  No one with\r\nany sense of self-respect will place himself on an equality in the matter\r\nof affection with those who are less lucky than himself in birth, health,\r\nmoney, good looks, capacity, or anything else.  Indeed, that dislike and\r\neven disgust should be felt by the fortunate for the unfortunate, or at\r\nany rate for those who have been discovered to have met with any of the\r\nmore serious and less familiar misfortunes, is not only natural, but\r\ndesirable for any society, whether of man or brute.\r\n\r\nThe fact, therefore, that the Erewhonians attach none of that guilt to\r\ncrime which they do to physical ailments, does not prevent the more\r\nselfish among them from neglecting a friend who has robbed a bank, for\r\ninstance, till he has fully recovered; but it does prevent them from even\r\nthinking of treating criminals with that contemptuous tone which would\r\nseem to say, "I, if I were you, should be a better man than you are," a\r\ntone which is held quite reasonable in regard to physical ailment.  Hence,\r\nthough they conceal ill health by every cunning and hypocrisy and\r\nartifice which they can devise, they are quite open about the most\r\nflagrant mental diseases, should they happen to exist, which to do the\r\npeople justice is not often.  Indeed, there are some who are, so to\r\nspeak, spiritual valetudinarians, and who make themselves exceedingly\r\nridiculous by their nervous supposition that they are wicked, while they\r\nare very tolerable people all the time.  This however is exceptional; and\r\non the whole they use much the same reserve or unreserve about the state\r\nof their moral welfare as we do about our health.\r\n\r\nHence all the ordinary greetings among ourselves, such as, How do you do?\r\nand the like, are considered signs of gross ill-breeding; nor do the\r\npoliter classes tolerate even such a common complimentary remark as\r\ntelling a man that he is looking well.  They salute each other with, "I\r\nhope you are good this morning;" or "I hope you have recovered from the\r\nsnappishness from which you were suffering when I last saw you;" and if\r\nthe person saluted has not been good, or is still snappish, he says so at\r\nonce and is condoled with accordingly.  Indeed, the straighteners have\r\ngone so far as to give names from the hypothetical language (as taught at\r\nthe Colleges of Unreason), to all known forms of mental indisposition,\r\nand to classify them according to a system of their own, which, though I\r\ncould not understand it, seemed to work well in practice; for they are\r\nalways able to tell a man what is the matter with him as soon as they\r\nhave heard his story, and their familiarity with the long names assures\r\nhim that they thoroughly understand his case.\r\n\r\nThe reader will have no difficulty in believing that the laws regarding\r\nill health were frequently evaded by the help of recognised fictions,\r\nwhich every one understood, but which it would be considered gross ill-\r\nbreeding to even seem to understand.  Thus, a day or two after my arrival\r\nat the Nosnibors\', one of the many ladies who called on me made excuses\r\nfor her husband\'s only sending his card, on the ground that when going\r\nthrough the public market-place that morning he had stolen a pair of\r\nsocks.  I had already been warned that I should never show surprise, so I\r\nmerely expressed my sympathy, and said that though I had only been in the\r\ncapital so short a time, I had already had a very narrow escape from\r\nstealing a clothes-brush, and that though I had resisted temptation so\r\nfar, I was sadly afraid that if I saw any object of special interest that\r\nwas neither too hot nor too heavy, I should have to put myself in the\r\nstraightener\'s hands.\r\n\r\nMrs. Nosnibor, who had been keeping an ear on all that I had been saying,\r\npraised me when the lady had gone.  Nothing, she said, could have been\r\nmore polite according to Erewhonian etiquette.  She then explained that\r\nto have stolen a pair of socks, or "to have the socks" (in more\r\ncolloquial language), was a recognised way of saying that the person in\r\nquestion was slightly indisposed.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all this they have a keen sense of the enjoyment consequent\r\nupon what they call being "well."  They admire mental health and love it\r\nin other people, and take all the pains they can (consistently with their\r\nother duties) to secure it for themselves.  They have an extreme dislike\r\nto marrying into what they consider unhealthy families.  They send for\r\nthe straightener at once whenever they have been guilty of anything\r\nseriously flagitious--often even if they think that they are on the point\r\nof committing it; and though his remedies are sometimes exceedingly\r\npainful, involving close confinement for weeks, and in some cases the\r\nmost cruel physical tortures, I never heard of a reasonable Erewhonian\r\nrefusing to do what his straightener told him, any more than of a\r\nreasonable Englishman refusing to undergo even the most frightful\r\noperation, if his doctors told him it was necessary.\r\n\r\nWe in England never shrink from telling our doctor what is the matter\r\nwith us merely through the fear that he will hurt us.  We let him do his\r\nworst upon us, and stand it without a murmur, because we are not scouted\r\nfor being ill, and because we know that the doctor is doing his best to\r\ncure us, and that he can judge of our case better than we can; but we\r\nshould conceal all illness if we were treated as the Erewhonians are when\r\nthey have anything the matter with them; we should do the same as with\r\nmoral and intellectual diseases,--we should feign health with the most\r\nconsummate art, till we were found out, and should hate a single flogging\r\ngiven in the way of mere punishment more than the amputation of a limb,\r\nif it were kindly and courteously performed from a wish to help us out of\r\nour difficulty, and with the full consciousness on the part of the doctor\r\nthat it was only by an accident of constitution that he was not in the\r\nlike plight himself.  So the Erewhonians take a flogging once a week, and\r\na diet of bread and water for two or three months together, whenever\r\ntheir straightener recommends it.\r\n\r\nI do not suppose that even my host, on having swindled a confiding widow\r\nout of the whole of her property, was put to more actual suffering than a\r\nman will readily undergo at the hands of an English doctor.  And yet he\r\nmust have had a very bad time of it.  The sounds I heard were sufficient\r\nto show that his pain was exquisite, but he never shrank from undergoing\r\nit.  He was quite sure that it did him good; and I think he was right.  I\r\ncannot believe that that man will ever embezzle money again.  He may--but\r\nit will be a long time before he does so.\r\n\r\nDuring my confinement in prison, and on my journey, I had already\r\ndiscovered a great deal of the above; but it still seemed surpassingly\r\nstrange, and I was in constant fear of committing some piece of rudeness,\r\nthrough my inability to look at things from the same stand-point as my\r\nneighbours; but after a few weeks\' stay with the Nosnibors, I got to\r\nunderstand things better, especially on having heard all about my host\'s\r\nillness, of which he told me fully and repeatedly.\r\n\r\nIt seemed that he had been on the Stock Exchange of the city for many\r\nyears and had amassed enormous wealth, without exceeding the limits of\r\nwhat was generally considered justifiable, or at any rate, permissible\r\ndealing; but at length on several occasions he had become aware of a\r\ndesire to make money by fraudulent representations, and had actually\r\ndealt with two or three sums in a way which had made him rather\r\nuncomfortable.  He had unfortunately made light of it and pooh-poohed the\r\nailment, until circumstances eventually presented themselves which\r\nenabled him to cheat upon a very considerable scale;--he told me what\r\nthey were, and they were about as bad as anything could be, but I need\r\nnot detail them;--he seized the opportunity, and became aware, when it\r\nwas too late, that he must be seriously out of order.  He had neglected\r\nhimself too long.\r\n\r\nHe drove home at once, broke the news to his wife and daughters as gently\r\nas he could, and sent off for one of the most celebrated straighteners of\r\nthe kingdom to a consultation with the family practitioner, for the case\r\nwas plainly serious.  On the arrival of the straightener he told his\r\nstory, and expressed his fear that his morals must be permanently\r\nimpaired.\r\n\r\nThe eminent man reassured him with a few cheering words, and then\r\nproceeded to make a more careful diagnosis of the case.  He inquired\r\nconcerning Mr. Nosnibor\'s parents--had their moral health been good?  He\r\nwas answered that there had not been anything seriously amiss with them,\r\nbut that his maternal grandfather, whom he was supposed to resemble\r\nsomewhat in person, had been a consummate scoundrel and had ended his\r\ndays in a hospital,--while a brother of his father\'s, after having led a\r\nmost flagitious life for many years, had been at last cured by a\r\nphilosopher of a new school, which as far as I could understand it bore\r\nmuch the same relation to the old as homoeopathy to allopathy.  The\r\nstraightener shook his head at this, and laughingly replied that the cure\r\nmust have been due to nature.  After a few more questions he wrote a\r\nprescription and departed.\r\n\r\nI saw the prescription.  It ordered a fine to the State of double the\r\nmoney embezzled; no food but bread and milk for six months, and a severe\r\nflogging once a month for twelve.  I was surprised to see that no part of\r\nthe fine was to be paid to the poor woman whose money had been embezzled,\r\nbut on inquiry I learned that she would have been prosecuted in the\r\nMisplaced Confidence Court, if she had not escaped its clutches by dying\r\nshortly after she had discovered her loss.\r\n\r\nAs for Mr. Nosnibor, he had received his eleventh flogging on the day of\r\nmy arrival.  I saw him later on the same afternoon, and he was still\r\ntwinged; but there had been no escape from following out the\r\nstraightener\'s prescription, for the so-called sanitary laws of Erewhon\r\nare very rigorous, and unless the straightener was satisfied that his\r\norders had been obeyed, the patient would have been taken to a hospital\r\n(as the poor are), and would have been much worse off.  Such at least is\r\nthe law, but it is never necessary to enforce it.\r\n\r\nOn a subsequent occasion I was present at an interview between Mr.\r\nNosnibor and the family straightener, who was considered competent to\r\nwatch the completion of the cure.  I was struck with the delicacy with\r\nwhich he avoided even the remotest semblance of inquiry after the\r\nphysical well-being of his patient, though there was a certain yellowness\r\nabout my host\'s eyes which argued a bilious habit of body.  To have taken\r\nnotice of this would have been a gross breach of professional etiquette.\r\nI was told, however, that a straightener sometimes thinks it right to\r\nglance at the possibility of some slight physical disorder if he finds it\r\nimportant in order to assist him in his diagnosis; but the answers which\r\nhe gets are generally untrue or evasive, and he forms his own conclusions\r\nupon the matter as well as he can.  Sensible men have been known to say\r\nthat the straightener should in strict confidence be told of every\r\nphysical ailment that is likely to bear upon the case; but people are\r\nnaturally shy of doing this, for they do not like lowering themselves in\r\nthe opinion of the straightener, and his ignorance of medical science is\r\nsupreme.  I heard of one lady, indeed, who had the hardihood to confess\r\nthat a furious outbreak of ill-humour and extravagant fancies for which\r\nshe was seeking advice was possibly the result of indisposition.  "You\r\nshould resist that," said the straightener, in a kind, but grave voice;\r\n"we can do nothing for the bodies of our patients; such matters are\r\nbeyond our province, and I desire that I may hear no further\r\nparticulars."  The lady burst into tears, and promised faithfully that\r\nshe would never be unwell again.\r\n\r\nBut to return to Mr. Nosnibor.  As the afternoon wore on many carriages\r\ndrove up with callers to inquire how he had stood his flogging.  It had\r\nbeen very severe, but the kind inquiries upon every side gave him great\r\npleasure, and he assured me that he felt almost tempted to do wrong again\r\nby the solicitude with which his friends had treated him during his\r\nrecovery: in this I need hardly say that he was not serious.\r\n\r\nDuring the remainder of my stay in the country Mr. Nosnibor was\r\nconstantly attentive to his business, and largely increased his already\r\ngreat possessions; but I never heard a whisper to the effect of his\r\nhaving been indisposed a second time, or made money by other than the\r\nmost strictly honourable means.  I did hear afterwards in confidence that\r\nthere had been reason to believe that his health had been not a little\r\naffected by the straightener\'s treatment, but his friends did not choose\r\nto be over-curious upon the subject, and on his return to his affairs it\r\nwas by common consent passed over as hardly criminal in one who was\r\notherwise so much afflicted.  For they regard bodily ailments as the more\r\nvenial in proportion as they have been produced by causes independent of\r\nthe constitution.  Thus if a person ruin his health by excessive\r\nindulgence at the table or by drinking, they count it to be almost a part\r\nof the mental disease which brought it about, and so it goes for little,\r\nbut they have no mercy on such illnesses as fevers or catarrhs or lung\r\ndiseases, which to us appear to be beyond the control of the individual.\r\nThey are only more lenient towards the diseases of the young--such as\r\nmeasles, which they think to be like sowing one\'s wild oats--and look\r\nover them as pardonable indiscretions if they have not been too serious,\r\nand if they are atoned for by complete subsequent recovery.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to say that the office of straightener is one\r\nwhich requires long and special training.  It stands to reason that he\r\nwho would cure a moral ailment must be practically acquainted with it in\r\nall its bearings.  The student for the profession of straightener is\r\nrequired to set apart certain seasons for the practice of each vice in\r\nturn, as a religious duty.  These seasons are called "fasts," and are\r\ncontinued by the student until he finds that he really can subdue all the\r\nmore usual vices in his own person, and hence can advise his patients\r\nfrom the results of his own experience.\r\n\r\nThose who intend to be specialists, rather than general practitioners,\r\ndevote themselves more particularly to the branch in which their practice\r\nwill mainly lie.  Some students have been obliged to continue their\r\nexercises during their whole lives, and some devoted men have actually\r\ndied as martyrs to the drink, or gluttony, or whatever branch of vice\r\nthey may have chosen for their especial study.  The greater number,\r\nhowever, take no harm by the excursions into the various departments of\r\nvice which it is incumbent upon them to study.\r\n\r\nFor the Erewhonians hold that unalloyed virtue is not a thing to be\r\nimmoderately indulged in.  I was shown more than one case in which the\r\nreal or supposed virtues of parents were visited upon the children to the\r\nthird and fourth generation.  The straighteners say that the most that\r\ncan be truly said for virtue is that there is a considerable balance in\r\nits favour, and that it is on the whole a good deal better to be on its\r\nside than against it; but they urge that there is much pseudo-virtue\r\ngoing about, which is apt to let people in very badly before they find it\r\nout.  Those men, they say, are best who are not remarkable either for\r\nvice or virtue.  I told them about Hogarth\'s idle and industrious\r\napprentices, but they did not seem to think that the industrious\r\napprentice was a very nice person.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI: SOME EREWHONIAN TRIALS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Erewhon as in other countries there are some courts of justice that\r\ndeal with special subjects.  Misfortune generally, as I have above\r\nexplained, is considered more or less criminal, but it admits of\r\nclassification, and a court is assigned to each of the main heads under\r\nwhich it can be supposed to fall.  Not very long after I had reached the\r\ncapital I strolled into the Personal Bereavement Court, and was much both\r\ninterested and pained by listening to the trial of a man who was accused\r\nof having just lost a wife to whom he had been tenderly attached, and who\r\nhad left him with three little children, of whom the eldest was only\r\nthree years old.\r\n\r\nThe defence which the prisoner\'s counsel endeavoured to establish was,\r\nthat the prisoner had never really loved his wife; but it broke down\r\ncompletely, for the public prosecutor called witness after witness who\r\ndeposed to the fact that the couple had been devoted to one another, and\r\nthe prisoner repeatedly wept as incidents were put in evidence that\r\nreminded him of the irreparable nature of the loss he had sustained.  The\r\njury returned a verdict of guilty after very little deliberation, but\r\nrecommended the prisoner to mercy on the ground that he had but recently\r\ninsured his wife\'s life for a considerable sum, and might be deemed lucky\r\ninasmuch as he had received the money without demur from the insurance\r\ncompany, though he had only paid two premiums.\r\n\r\nI have just said that the jury found the prisoner guilty.  When the judge\r\npassed sentence, I was struck with the way in which the prisoner\'s\r\ncounsel was rebuked for having referred to a work in which the guilt of\r\nsuch misfortunes as the prisoner\'s was extenuated to a degree that roused\r\nthe indignation of the court.\r\n\r\n"We shall have," said the judge, "these crude and subversionary books\r\nfrom time to time until it is recognised as an axiom of morality that\r\nluck is the only fit object of human veneration.  How far a man has any\r\nright to be more lucky and hence more venerable than his neighbours, is a\r\npoint that always has been, and always will be, settled proximately by a\r\nkind of higgling and haggling of the market, and ultimately by brute\r\nforce; but however this may be, it stands to reason that no man should be\r\nallowed to be unlucky to more than a very moderate extent."\r\n\r\nThen, turning to the prisoner, the judge continued:--"You have suffered a\r\ngreat loss.  Nature attaches a severe penalty to such offences, and human\r\nlaw must emphasise the decrees of nature.  But for the recommendation of\r\nthe jury I should have given you six months\' hard labour.  I will,\r\nhowever, commute your sentence to one of three months, with the option of\r\na fine of twenty-five per cent. of the money you have received from the\r\ninsurance company."\r\n\r\nThe prisoner thanked the judge, and said that as he had no one to look\r\nafter his children if he was sent to prison, he would embrace the option\r\nmercifully permitted him by his lordship, and pay the sum he had named.\r\nHe was then removed from the dock.\r\n\r\nThe next case was that of a youth barely arrived at man\'s estate, who was\r\ncharged with having been swindled out of large property during his\r\nminority by his guardian, who was also one of his nearest relations.  His\r\nfather had been long dead, and it was for this reason that his offence\r\ncame on for trial in the Personal Bereavement Court.  The lad, who was\r\nundefended, pleaded that he was young, inexperienced, greatly in awe of\r\nhis guardian, and without independent professional advice.  "Young man,"\r\nsaid the judge sternly, "do not talk nonsense.  People have no right to\r\nbe young, inexperienced, greatly in awe of their guardians, and without\r\nindependent professional advice.  If by such indiscretions they outrage\r\nthe moral sense of their friends, they must expect to suffer\r\naccordingly."  He then ordered the prisoner to apologise to his guardian,\r\nand to receive twelve strokes with a cat-of-nine-tails.\r\n\r\nBut I shall perhaps best convey to the reader an idea of the entire\r\nperversion of thought which exists among this extraordinary people, by\r\ndescribing the public trial of a man who was accused of pulmonary\r\nconsumption--an offence which was punished with death until quite\r\nrecently.  It did not occur till I had been some months in the country,\r\nand I am deviating from chronological order in giving it here; but I had\r\nperhaps better do so in order that I may exhaust this subject before\r\nproceeding to others.  Moreover I should never come to an end were I to\r\nkeep to a strictly narrative form, and detail the infinite absurdities\r\nwith which I daily came in contact.\r\n\r\nThe prisoner was placed in the dock, and the jury were sworn much as in\r\nEurope; almost all our own modes of procedure were reproduced, even to\r\nthe requiring the prisoner to plead guilty or not guilty.  He pleaded not\r\nguilty, and the case proceeded.  The evidence for the prosecution was\r\nvery strong; but I must do the court the justice to observe that the\r\ntrial was absolutely impartial.  Counsel for the prisoner was allowed to\r\nurge everything that could be said in his defence: the line taken was\r\nthat the prisoner was simulating consumption in order to defraud an\r\ninsurance company, from which he was about to buy an annuity, and that he\r\nhoped thus to obtain it on more advantageous terms.  If this could have\r\nbeen shown to be the case he would have escaped a criminal prosecution,\r\nand been sent to a hospital as for a moral ailment.  The view, however,\r\nwas one which could not be reasonably sustained, in spite of all the\r\ningenuity and eloquence of one of the most celebrated advocates of the\r\ncountry.  The case was only too clear, for the prisoner was almost at the\r\npoint of death, and it was astonishing that he had not been tried and\r\nconvicted long previously.  His coughing was incessant during the whole\r\ntrial, and it was all that the two jailors in charge of him could do to\r\nkeep him on his legs until it was over.\r\n\r\nThe summing up of the judge was admirable.  He dwelt upon every point\r\nthat could be construed in favour of the prisoner, but as he proceeded it\r\nbecame clear that the evidence was too convincing to admit of doubt, and\r\nthere was but one opinion in the court as to the impending verdict when\r\nthe jury retired from the box.  They were absent for about ten minutes,\r\nand on their return the foreman pronounced the prisoner guilty.  There\r\nwas a faint murmur of applause, but it was instantly repressed.  The\r\njudge then proceeded to pronounce sentence in words which I can never\r\nforget, and which I copied out into a note-book next day from the report\r\nthat was published in the leading newspaper.  I must condense it\r\nsomewhat, and nothing which I could say would give more than a faint idea\r\nof the solemn, not to say majestic, severity with which it was delivered.\r\nThe sentence was as follows:-\r\n\r\n"Prisoner at the bar, you have been accused of the great crime of\r\nlabouring under pulmonary consumption, and after an impartial trial\r\nbefore a jury of your countrymen, you have been found guilty.  Against\r\nthe justice of the verdict I can say nothing: the evidence against you\r\nwas conclusive, and it only remains for me to pass such a sentence upon\r\nyou, as shall satisfy the ends of the law.  That sentence must be a very\r\nsevere one.  It pains me much to see one who is yet so young, and whose\r\nprospects in life were otherwise so excellent, brought to this\r\ndistressing condition by a constitution which I can only regard as\r\nradically vicious; but yours is no case for compassion: this is not your\r\nfirst offence: you have led a career of crime, and have only profited by\r\nthe leniency shown you upon past occasions, to offend yet more seriously\r\nagainst the laws and institutions of your country.  You were convicted of\r\naggravated bronchitis last year: and I find that though you are now only\r\ntwenty-three years old, you have been imprisoned on no less than fourteen\r\noccasions for illnesses of a more or less hateful character; in fact, it\r\nis not too much to say that you have spent the greater part of your life\r\nin a jail.\r\n\r\n"It is all very well for you to say that you came of unhealthy parents,\r\nand had a severe accident in your childhood which permanently undermined\r\nyour constitution; excuses such as these are the ordinary refuge of the\r\ncriminal; but they cannot for one moment be listened to by the ear of\r\njustice.  I am not here to enter upon curious metaphysical questions as\r\nto the origin of this or that--questions to which there would be no end\r\nwere their introduction once tolerated, and which would result in\r\nthrowing the only guilt on the tissues of the primordial cell, or on the\r\nelementary gases.  There is no question of how you came to be wicked, but\r\nonly this--namely, are you wicked or not?  This has been decided in the\r\naffirmative, neither can I hesitate for a single moment to say that it\r\nhas been decided justly.  You are a bad and dangerous person, and stand\r\nbranded in the eyes of your fellow-countrymen with one of the most\r\nheinous known offences.\r\n\r\n"It is not my business to justify the law: the law may in some cases have\r\nits inevitable hardships, and I may feel regret at times that I have not\r\nthe option of passing a less severe sentence than I am compelled to do.\r\nBut yours is no such case; on the contrary, had not the capital\r\npunishment for consumption been abolished, I should certainly inflict it\r\nnow.\r\n\r\n"It is intolerable that an example of such terrible enormity should be\r\nallowed to go at large unpunished.  Your presence in the society of\r\nrespectable people would lead the less able-bodied to think more lightly\r\nof all forms of illness; neither can it be permitted that you should have\r\nthe chance of corrupting unborn beings who might hereafter pester you.\r\nThe unborn must not be allowed to come near you: and this not so much for\r\ntheir protection (for they are our natural enemies), as for our own; for\r\nsince they will not be utterly gainsaid, it must be seen to that they\r\nshall be quartered upon those who are least likely to corrupt them.\r\n\r\n"But independently of this consideration, and independently of the\r\nphysical guilt which attaches itself to a crime so great as yours, there\r\nis yet another reason why we should be unable to show you mercy, even if\r\nwe were inclined to do so.  I refer to the existence of a class of men\r\nwho lie hidden among us, and who are called physicians.  Were the\r\nseverity of the law or the current feeling of the country to be relaxed\r\nnever so slightly, these abandoned persons, who are now compelled to\r\npractise secretly and who can be consulted only at the greatest risk,\r\nwould become frequent visitors in every household; their organisation and\r\ntheir intimate acquaintance with all family secrets would give them a\r\npower, both social and political, which nothing could resist.  The head\r\nof the household would become subordinate to the family doctor, who would\r\ninterfere between man and wife, between master and servant, until the\r\ndoctors should be the only depositaries of power in the nation, and have\r\nall that we hold precious at their mercy.  A time of universal\r\ndephysicalisation would ensue; medicine-vendors of all kinds would abound\r\nin our streets and advertise in all our newspapers.  There is one remedy\r\nfor this, and one only.  It is that which the laws of this country have\r\nlong received and acted upon, and consists in the sternest repression of\r\nall diseases whatsoever, as soon as their existence is made manifest to\r\nthe eye of the law.  Would that that eye were far more piercing than it\r\nis.\r\n\r\n"But I will enlarge no further upon things that are themselves so\r\nobvious.  You may say that it is not your fault.  The answer is ready\r\nenough at hand, and it amounts to this--that if you had been born of\r\nhealthy and well-to-do parents, and been well taken care of when you were\r\na child, you would never have offended against the laws of your country,\r\nnor found yourself in your present disgraceful position.  If you tell me\r\nthat you had no hand in your parentage and education, and that it is\r\ntherefore unjust to lay these things to your charge, I answer that\r\nwhether your being in a consumption is your fault or no, it is a fault in\r\nyou, and it is my duty to see that against such faults as this the\r\ncommonwealth shall be protected.  You may say that it is your misfortune\r\nto be criminal; I answer that it is your crime to be unfortunate.\r\n\r\n"Lastly, I should point out that even though the jury had acquitted you--a\r\nsupposition that I cannot seriously entertain--I should have felt it my\r\nduty to inflict a sentence hardly less severe than that which I must pass\r\nat present; for the more you had been found guiltless of the crime\r\nimputed to you, the more you would have been found guilty of one hardly\r\nless heinous--I mean the crime of having been maligned unjustly.\r\n\r\n"I do not hesitate therefore to sentence you to imprisonment, with hard\r\nlabour, for the rest of your miserable existence.  During that period I\r\nwould earnestly entreat you to repent of the wrongs you have done\r\nalready, and to entirely reform the constitution of your whole body.  I\r\nentertain but little hope that you will pay attention to my advice; you\r\nare already far too abandoned.  Did it rest with myself, I should add\r\nnothing in mitigation of the sentence which I have passed, but it is the\r\nmerciful provision of the law that even the most hardened criminal shall\r\nbe allowed some one of the three official remedies, which is to be\r\nprescribed at the time of his conviction.  I shall therefore order that\r\nyou receive two tablespoonfuls of castor oil daily, until the pleasure of\r\nthe court be further known."\r\n\r\nWhen the sentence was concluded the prisoner acknowledged in a few\r\nscarcely audible words that he was justly punished, and that he had had a\r\nfair trial.  He was then removed to the prison from which he was never to\r\nreturn.  There was a second attempt at applause when the judge had\r\nfinished speaking, but as before it was at once repressed; and though the\r\nfeeling of the court was strongly against the prisoner, there was no show\r\nof any violence against him, if one may except a little hooting from the\r\nbystanders when he was being removed in the prisoners\' van.  Indeed,\r\nnothing struck me more during my whole sojourn in the country, than the\r\ngeneral respect for law and order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII: MALCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nI confess that I felt rather unhappy when I got home, and thought more\r\nclosely over the trial that I had just witnessed.  For the time I was\r\ncarried away by the opinion of those among whom I was.  They had no\r\nmisgivings about what they were doing.  There did not seem to be a person\r\nin the whole court who had the smallest doubt but that all was exactly as\r\nit should be.  This universal unsuspecting confidence was imparted by\r\nsympathy to myself, in spite of all my training in opinions so widely\r\ndifferent.  So it is with most of us: that which we observe to be taken\r\nas a matter of course by those around us, we take as a matter of course\r\nourselves.  And after all, it is our duty to do this, save upon grave\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nBut when I was alone, and began to think the trial over, it certainly did\r\nstrike me as betraying a strange and untenable position.  Had the judge\r\nsaid that he acknowledged the probable truth, namely, that the prisoner\r\nwas born of unhealthy parents, or had been starved in infancy, or had met\r\nwith some accidents which had developed consumption; and had he then gone\r\non to say that though he knew all this, and bitterly regretted that the\r\nprotection of society obliged him to inflict additional pain on one who\r\nhad suffered so much already, yet that there was no help for it, I could\r\nhave understood the position, however mistaken I might have thought it.\r\nThe judge was fully persuaded that the infliction of pain upon the weak\r\nand sickly was the only means of preventing weakness and sickliness from\r\nspreading, and that ten times the suffering now inflicted upon the\r\naccused was eventually warded off from others by the present apparent\r\nseverity.  I could therefore perfectly understand his inflicting whatever\r\npain he might consider necessary in order to prevent so bad an example\r\nfrom spreading further and lowering the Erewhonian standard; but it\r\nseemed almost childish to tell the prisoner that he could have been in\r\ngood health, if he had been more fortunate in his constitution, and been\r\nexposed to less hardships when he was a boy.\r\n\r\nI write with great diffidence, but it seems to me that there is no\r\nunfairness in punishing people for their misfortunes, or rewarding them\r\nfor their sheer good luck: it is the normal condition of human life that\r\nthis should be done, and no right-minded person will complain of being\r\nsubjected to the common treatment.  There is no alternative open to us.\r\nIt is idle to say that men are not responsible for their misfortunes.\r\nWhat is responsibility?  Surely to be responsible means to be liable to\r\nhave to give an answer should it be demanded, and all things which live\r\nare responsible for their lives and actions should society see fit to\r\nquestion them through the mouth of its authorised agent.\r\n\r\nWhat is the offence of a lamb that we should rear it, and tend it, and\r\nlull it into security, for the express purpose of killing it?  Its\r\noffence is the misfortune of being something which society wants to eat,\r\nand which cannot defend itself.  This is ample.  Who shall limit the\r\nright of society except society itself?  And what consideration for the\r\nindividual is tolerable unless society be the gainer thereby?  Wherefore\r\nshould a man be so richly rewarded for having been son to a millionaire,\r\nwere it not clearly provable that the common welfare is thus better\r\nfurthered?  We cannot seriously detract from a man\'s merit in having been\r\nthe son of a rich father without imperilling our own tenure of things\r\nwhich we do not wish to jeopardise; if this were otherwise we should not\r\nlet him keep his money for a single hour; we would have it ourselves at\r\nonce.  For property is robbery, but then, we are all robbers or would-be\r\nrobbers together, and have found it essential to organise our thieving,\r\nas we have found it necessary to organise our lust and our revenge.\r\nProperty, marriage, the law; as the bed to the river, so rule and\r\nconvention to the instinct; and woe to him who tampers with the banks\r\nwhile the flood is flowing.\r\n\r\nBut to return.  Even in England a man on board a ship with yellow fever\r\nis held responsible for his mischance, no matter what his being kept in\r\nquarantine may cost him.  He may catch the fever and die; we cannot help\r\nit; he must take his chance as other people do; but surely it would be\r\ndesperate unkindness to add contumely to our self-protection, unless,\r\nindeed, we believe that contumely is one of our best means of\r\nself-protection.  Again, take the case of maniacs.  We say that they are\r\nirresponsible for their actions, but we take good care, or ought to take\r\ngood care, that they shall answer to us for their insanity, and we\r\nimprison them in what we call an asylum (that modern sanctuary!) if we do\r\nnot like their answers.  This is a strange kind of irresponsibility.  What\r\nwe ought to say is that we can afford to be satisfied with a less\r\nsatisfactory answer from a lunatic than from one who is not mad, because\r\nlunacy is less infectious than crime.\r\n\r\nWe kill a serpent if we go in danger by it, simply for being such and\r\nsuch a serpent in such and such a place; but we never say that the\r\nserpent has only itself to blame for not having been a harmless creature.\r\nIts crime is that of being the thing which it is: but this is a capital\r\noffence, and we are right in killing it out of the way, unless we think\r\nit more danger to do so than to let it escape; nevertheless we pity the\r\ncreature, even though we kill it.\r\n\r\nBut in the case of him whose trial I have described above, it was\r\nimpossible that any one in the court should not have known that it was\r\nbut by an accident of birth and circumstances that he was not himself\r\nalso in a consumption; and yet none thought that it disgraced them to\r\nhear the judge give vent to the most cruel truisms about him.  The judge\r\nhimself was a kind and thoughtful person.  He was a man of magnificent\r\nand benign presence.  He was evidently of an iron constitution, and his\r\nface wore an expression of the maturest wisdom and experience; yet for\r\nall this, old and learned as he was, he could not see things which one\r\nwould have thought would have been apparent even to a child.  He could\r\nnot emancipate himself from, nay, it did not even occur to him to feel,\r\nthe bondage of the ideas in which he had been born and bred.\r\n\r\nSo was it also with the jury and bystanders; and--most wonderful of\r\nall--so was it even with the prisoner.  Throughout he seemed fully\r\nimpressed with the notion that he was being dealt with justly: he saw\r\nnothing wanton in his being told by the judge that he was to be punished,\r\nnot so much as a necessary protection to society (although this was not\r\nentirely lost sight of), as because he had not been better born and bred\r\nthan he was.  But this led me to hope that he suffered less than he would\r\nhave done if he had seen the matter in the same light that I did.  And,\r\nafter all, justice is relative.\r\n\r\nI may here mention that only a few years before my arrival in the\r\ncountry, the treatment of all convicted invalids had been much more\r\nbarbarous than now, for no physical remedy was provided, and prisoners\r\nwere put to the severest labour in all sorts of weather, so that most of\r\nthem soon succumbed to the extreme hardships which they suffered; this\r\nwas supposed to be beneficial in some ways, inasmuch as it put the\r\ncountry to less expense for the maintenance of its criminal class; but\r\nthe growth of luxury had induced a relaxation of the old severity, and a\r\nsensitive age would no longer tolerate what appeared to be an excess of\r\nrigour, even towards the most guilty; moreover, it was found that juries\r\nwere less willing to convict, and justice was often cheated because there\r\nwas no alternative between virtually condemning a man to death and\r\nletting him go free; it was also held that the country paid in\r\nrecommittals for its over-severity; for those who had been imprisoned\r\neven for trifling ailments were often permanently disabled by their\r\nimprisonment; and when a man had been once convicted, it was probable\r\nthat he would seldom afterwards be off the hands of the country.\r\n\r\nThese evils had long been apparent and recognised; yet people were too\r\nindolent, and too indifferent to suffering not their own, to bestir\r\nthemselves about putting an end to them, until at last a benevolent\r\nreformer devoted his whole life to effecting the necessary changes.  He\r\ndivided all illnesses into three classes--those affecting the head, the\r\ntrunk, and the lower limbs--and obtained an enactment that all diseases\r\nof the head, whether internal or external, should be treated with\r\nlaudanum, those of the body with castor-oil, and those of the lower limbs\r\nwith an embrocation of strong sulphuric acid and water.\r\n\r\nIt may be said that the classification was not sufficiently careful, and\r\nthat the remedies were ill chosen; but it is a hard thing to initiate any\r\nreform, and it was necessary to familiarise the public mind with the\r\nprinciple, by inserting the thin end of the wedge first: it is not,\r\ntherefore, to be wondered at that among so practical a people there\r\nshould still be some room for improvement.  The mass of the nation are\r\nwell pleased with existing arrangements, and believe that their treatment\r\nof criminals leaves little or nothing to be desired; but there is an\r\nenergetic minority who hold what are considered to be extreme opinions,\r\nand who are not at all disposed to rest contented until the principle\r\nlately admitted has been carried further.\r\n\r\nI was at some pains to discover the opinions of these men, and their\r\nreasons for entertaining them.  They are held in great odium by the\r\ngenerality of the public, and are considered as subverters of all\r\nmorality whatever.  The malcontents, on the other hand, assert that\r\nillness is the inevitable result of certain antecedent causes, which, in\r\nthe great majority of cases, were beyond the control of the individual,\r\nand that therefore a man is only guilty for being in a consumption in the\r\nsame way as rotten fruit is guilty for having gone rotten.  True, the\r\nfruit must be thrown on one side as unfit for man\'s use, and the man in a\r\nconsumption must be put in prison for the protection of his\r\nfellow-citizens; but these radicals would not punish him further than by\r\nloss of liberty and a strict surveillance.  So long as he was prevented\r\nfrom injuring society, they would allow him to make himself useful by\r\nsupplying whatever of society\'s wants he could supply.  If he succeeded\r\nin thus earning money, they would have him made as comfortable in prison\r\nas possible, and would in no way interfere with his liberty more than was\r\nnecessary to prevent him from escaping, or from becoming more severely\r\nindisposed within the prison walls; but they would deduct from his\r\nearnings the expenses of his board, lodging, surveillance, and half those\r\nof his conviction.  If he was too ill to do anything for his support in\r\nprison, they would allow him nothing but bread and water, and very little\r\nof that.\r\n\r\nThey say that society is foolish in refusing to allow itself to be\r\nbenefited by a man merely because he has done it harm hitherto, and that\r\nobjection to the labour of the diseased classes is only protection in\r\nanother form.  It is an attempt to raise the natural price of a commodity\r\nby saying that such and such persons, who are able and willing to produce\r\nit, shall not do so, whereby every one has to pay more for it.\r\n\r\nBesides, so long as a man has not been actually killed he is our fellow-\r\ncreature, though perhaps a very unpleasant one.  It is in a great degree\r\nthe doing of others that he is what he is, or in other words, the society\r\nwhich now condemns him is partly answerable concerning him.  They say\r\nthat there is no fear of any increase of disease under these\r\ncircumstances; for the loss of liberty, the surveillance, the\r\nconsiderable and compulsory deduction from the prisoner\'s earnings, the\r\nvery sparing use of stimulants (of which they would allow but little to\r\nany, and none to those who did not earn them), the enforced celibacy, and\r\nabove all, the loss of reputation among friends, are in their opinion as\r\nample safeguards to society against a general neglect of health as those\r\nnow resorted to.  A man, therefore, (so they say) should carry his\r\nprofession or trade into prison with him if possible; if not, he must\r\nearn his living by the nearest thing to it that he can; but if he be a\r\ngentleman born and bred to no profession, he must pick oakum, or write\r\nart criticisms for a newspaper.\r\n\r\nThese people say further, that the greater part of the illness which\r\nexists in their country is brought about by the insane manner in which it\r\nis treated.\r\n\r\nThey believe that illness is in many cases just as curable as the moral\r\ndiseases which they see daily cured around them, but that a great reform\r\nis impossible till men learn to take a juster view of what physical\r\nobliquity proceeds from.  Men will hide their illnesses as long as they\r\nare scouted on its becoming known that they are ill; it is the scouting,\r\nnot the physic, which produces the concealment; and if a man felt that\r\nthe news of his being in ill-health would be received by his neighbours\r\nas a deplorable fact, but one as much the result of necessary antecedent\r\ncauses as though he had broken into a jeweller\'s shop and stolen a\r\nvaluable diamond necklace--as a fact which might just as easily have\r\nhappened to themselves, only that they had the luck to be better born or\r\nreared; and if they also felt that they would not be made more\r\nuncomfortable in the prison than the protection of society against\r\ninfection and the proper treatment of their own disease actually\r\ndemanded, men would give themselves up to the police as readily on\r\nperceiving that they had taken small-pox, as they go now to the\r\nstraightener when they feel that they are on the point of forging a will,\r\nor running away with somebody else\'s wife.\r\n\r\nBut the main argument on which they rely is that of economy: for they\r\nknow that they will sooner gain their end by appealing to men\'s pockets,\r\nin which they have generally something of their own, than to their heads,\r\nwhich contain for the most part little but borrowed or stolen property;\r\nand also, they believe it to be the readiest test and the one which has\r\nmost to show for itself.  If a course of conduct can be shown to cost a\r\ncountry less, and this by no dishonourable saving and with no indirectly\r\nincreased expenditure in other ways, they hold that it requires a good\r\ndeal to upset the arguments in favour of its being adopted, and whether\r\nrightly or wrongly I cannot pretend to say, they think that the more\r\nmedicinal and humane treatment of the diseased of which they are the\r\nadvocates would in the long run be much cheaper to the country: but I did\r\nnot gather that these reformers were opposed to meeting some of the more\r\nviolent forms of illness with the cat-of-nine-tails, or with death; for\r\nthey saw no so effectual way of checking them; they would therefore both\r\nflog and hang, but they would do so pitifully.\r\n\r\nI have perhaps dwelt too long upon opinions which can have no possible\r\nbearing upon our own, but I have not said the tenth part of what these\r\nwould-be reformers urged upon me.  I feel, however, that I have\r\nsufficiently trespassed upon the attention of the reader.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII: THE VIEWS OF THE EREWHONIANS CONCERNING DEATH\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Erewhonians regard death with less abhorrence than disease.  If it is\r\nan offence at all, it is one beyond the reach of the law, which is\r\ntherefore silent on the subject; but they insist that the greater number\r\nof those who are commonly said to die, have never yet been born--not, at\r\nleast, into that unseen world which is alone worthy of consideration.  As\r\nregards this unseen world I understand them to say that some miscarry in\r\nrespect to it before they have even reached the seen, and some after,\r\nwhile few are ever truly born into it at all--the greater part of all the\r\nmen and women over the whole country miscarrying before they reach it.\r\nAnd they say that this does not matter so much as we think it does.\r\n\r\nAs for what we call death, they argue that too much has been made of it.\r\nThe mere knowledge that we shall one day die does not make us very\r\nunhappy; no one thinks that he or she will escape, so that none are\r\ndisappointed.  We do not care greatly even though we know that we have\r\nnot long to live; the only thing that would seriously affect us would be\r\nthe knowing--or rather thinking that we know--the precise moment at which\r\nthe blow will fall.  Happily no one can ever certainly know this, though\r\nmany try to make themselves miserable by endeavouring to find it out.  It\r\nseems as though there were some power somewhere which mercifully stays us\r\nfrom putting that sting into the tail of death, which we would put there\r\nif we could, and which ensures that though death must always be a\r\nbugbear, it shall never under any conceivable circumstances be more than\r\na bugbear.\r\n\r\nFor even though a man is condemned to die in a week\'s time and is shut up\r\nin a prison from which it is certain that he cannot escape, he will\r\nalways hope that a reprieve may come before the week is over.  Besides,\r\nthe prison may catch fire, and he may be suffocated not with a rope, but\r\nwith common ordinary smoke; or he may be struck dead by lightning while\r\nexercising in the prison yards.  When the morning is come on which the\r\npoor wretch is to be hanged, he may choke at his breakfast, or die from\r\nfailure of the heart\'s action before the drop has fallen; and even though\r\nit has fallen, he cannot be quite certain that he is going to die, for he\r\ncannot know this till his death has actually taken place, and it will be\r\ntoo late then for him to discover that he was going to die at the\r\nappointed hour after all.  The Erewhonians, therefore, hold that death,\r\nlike life, is an affair of being more frightened than hurt.\r\n\r\nThey burn their dead, and the ashes are presently scattered over any\r\npiece of ground which the deceased may himself have chosen.  No one is\r\npermitted to refuse this hospitality to the dead: people, therefore,\r\ngenerally choose some garden or orchard which they may have known and\r\nbeen fond of when they were young.  The superstitious hold that those\r\nwhose ashes are scattered over any land become its jealous guardians from\r\nthat time forward; and the living like to think that they shall become\r\nidentified with this or that locality where they have once been happy.\r\n\r\nThey do not put up monuments, nor write epitaphs, for their dead, though\r\nin former ages their practice was much as ours, but they have a custom\r\nwhich comes to much the same thing, for the instinct of preserving the\r\nname alive after the death of the body seems to be common to all mankind.\r\nThey have statues of themselves made while they are still alive (those,\r\nthat is, who can afford it), and write inscriptions under them, which are\r\noften quite as untruthful as are our own epitaphs--only in another way.\r\nFor they do not hesitate to describe themselves as victims to ill temper,\r\njealousy, covetousness, and the like, but almost always lay claim to\r\npersonal beauty, whether they have it or not, and, often, to the\r\npossession of a large sum in the funded debt of the country.  If a person\r\nis ugly he does not sit as a model for his own statue, although it bears\r\nhis name.  He gets the handsomest of his friends to sit for him, and one\r\nof the ways of paying a compliment to another is to ask him to sit for\r\nsuch a statue.  Women generally sit for their own statues, from a natural\r\ndisinclination to admit the superior beauty of a friend, but they expect\r\nto be idealised.  I understood that the multitude of these statues was\r\nbeginning to be felt as an encumbrance in almost every family, and that\r\nthe custom would probably before long fall into desuetude.\r\n\r\nIndeed, this has already come about to the satisfaction of every one, as\r\nregards the statues of public men--not more than three of which can be\r\nfound in the whole capital.  I expressed my surprise at this, and was\r\ntold that some five hundred years before my visit, the city had been so\r\noverrun with these pests, that there was no getting about, and people\r\nwere worried beyond endurance by having their attention called at every\r\ntouch and turn to something, which, when they had attended to it, they\r\nfound not to concern them.  Most of these statues were mere attempts to\r\ndo for some man or woman what an animal-stuffer does more successfully\r\nfor a dog, or bird, or pike.  They were generally foisted on the public\r\nby some coterie that was trying to exalt itself in exalting some one\r\nelse, and not unfrequently they had no other inception than desire on the\r\npart of some member of the coterie to find a job for a young sculptor to\r\nwhom his daughter was engaged.  Statues so begotten could never be\r\nanything but deformities, and this is the way in which they are sure to\r\nbe begotten, as soon as the art of making them at all has become widely\r\npractised.\r\n\r\nI know not why, but all the noblest arts hold in perfection but for a\r\nvery little moment.  They soon reach a height from which they begin to\r\ndecline, and when they have begun to decline it is a pity that they\r\ncannot be knocked on the head; for an art is like a living\r\norganism--better dead than dying.  There is no way of making an aged art\r\nyoung again; it must be born anew and grow up from infancy as a new\r\nthing, working out its own salvation from effort to effort in all fear\r\nand trembling.\r\n\r\nThe Erewhonians five hundred years ago understood nothing of all this--I\r\ndoubt whether they even do so now.  They wanted to get the nearest thing\r\nthey could to a stuffed man whose stuffing should not grow mouldy.  They\r\nshould have had some such an establishment as our Madame Tussaud\'s, where\r\nthe figures wear real clothes, and are painted up to nature.  Such an\r\ninstitution might have been made self-supporting, for people might have\r\nbeen made to pay before going in.  As it was, they had let their poor\r\ncold grimy colourless heroes and heroines loaf about in squares and in\r\ncorners of streets in all weathers, without any attempt at artistic\r\nsanitation--for there was no provision for burying their dead works of\r\nart out of their sight--no drainage, so to speak, whereby statues that\r\nhad been sufficiently assimilated, so as to form part of the residuary\r\nimpression of the country, might be carried away out of the system.  Hence\r\nthey put them up with a light heart on the cackling of their coteries,\r\nand they and their children had to live, often enough, with some wordy\r\nwindbag whose cowardice had cost the country untold loss in blood and\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nAt last the evil reached such a pitch that the people rose, and with\r\nindiscriminate fury destroyed good and bad alike.  Most of what was\r\ndestroyed was bad, but some few works were good, and the sculptors of to-\r\nday wring their hands over some of the fragments that have been preserved\r\nin museums up and down the country.  For a couple of hundred years or so,\r\nnot a statue was made from one end of the kingdom to the other, but the\r\ninstinct for having stuffed men and women was so strong, that people at\r\nlength again began to try to make them.  Not knowing how to make them,\r\nand having no academics to mislead them, the earliest sculptors of this\r\nperiod thought things out for themselves, and again produced works that\r\nwere full of interest, so that in three or four generations they reached\r\na perfection hardly if at all inferior to that of several hundred years\r\nearlier.\r\n\r\nOn this the same evils recurred.  Sculptors obtained high prices--the art\r\nbecame a trade--schools arose which professed to sell the holy spirit of\r\nart for money; pupils flocked from far and near to buy it, in the hopes\r\nof selling it later on, and were struck purblind as a punishment for the\r\nsin of those who sent them.  Before long a second iconoclastic fury would\r\ninfallibly have followed, but for the prescience of a statesman who\r\nsucceeded in passing an Act to the effect that no statue of any public\r\nman or woman should be allowed to remain unbroken for more than fifty\r\nyears, unless at the end of that time a jury of twenty-four men taken at\r\nrandom from the street pronounced in favour of its being allowed a second\r\nfifty years of life.  Every fifty years this reconsideration was to be\r\nrepeated, and unless there was a majority of eighteen in favour of the\r\nretention of the statue, it was to be destroyed.\r\n\r\nPerhaps a simpler plan would have been to forbid the erection of a statue\r\nto any public man or woman till he or she had been dead at least one\r\nhundred years, and even then to insist on reconsideration of the claims\r\nof the deceased and the merit of the statue every fifty years--but the\r\nworking of the Act brought about results that on the whole were\r\nsatisfactory.  For in the first place, many public statues that would\r\nhave been voted under the old system, were not ordered, when it was known\r\nthat they would be almost certainly broken up after fifty years, and in\r\nthe second, public sculptors knowing their work to be so ephemeral,\r\nscamped it to an extent that made it offensive even to the most\r\nuncultured eye.  Hence before long subscribers took to paying the\r\nsculptor for the statue of their dead statesmen, on condition that he did\r\nnot make it.  The tribute of respect was thus paid to the deceased, the\r\npublic sculptors were not mulcted, and the rest of the public suffered no\r\ninconvenience.\r\n\r\nI was told, however, that an abuse of this custom is growing up, inasmuch\r\nas the competition for the commission not to make a statue is so keen,\r\nthat sculptors have been known to return a considerable part of the\r\npurchase money to the subscribers, by an arrangement made with them\r\nbeforehand.  Such transactions, however, are always clandestine.  A small\r\ninscription is let into the pavement, where the public statue would have\r\nstood, which informs the reader that such a statue has been ordered for\r\nthe person, whoever he or she may be, but that as yet the sculptor has\r\nnot been able to complete it.  There has been no Act to repress statues\r\nthat are intended for private consumption, but as I have said, the custom\r\nis falling into desuetude.\r\n\r\nReturning to Erewhonian customs in connection with death, there is one\r\nwhich I can hardly pass over.  When any one dies, the friends of the\r\nfamily write no letters of condolence, neither do they attend the\r\nscattering, nor wear mourning, but they send little boxes filled with\r\nartificial tears, and with the name of the sender painted neatly upon the\r\noutside of the lid.  The tears vary in number from two to fifteen or\r\nsixteen, according to degree of intimacy or relationship; and people\r\nsometimes find it a nice point of etiquette to know the exact number\r\nwhich they ought to send.  Strange as it may appear, this attention is\r\nhighly valued, and its omission by those from whom it might be expected\r\nis keenly felt.  These tears were formerly stuck with adhesive plaster to\r\nthe cheeks of the bereaved, and were worn in public for a few months\r\nafter the death of a relative; they were then banished to the hat or\r\nbonnet, and are now no longer worn.\r\n\r\nThe birth of a child is looked upon as a painful subject on which it is\r\nkinder not to touch: the illness of the mother is carefully concealed\r\nuntil the necessity for signing the birth-formula (of which hereafter)\r\nrenders further secrecy impossible, and for some months before the event\r\nthe family live in retirement, seeing very little company.  When the\r\noffence is over and done with, it is condoned by the common want of\r\nlogic; for this merciful provision of nature, this buffer against\r\ncollisions, this friction which upsets our calculations but without which\r\nexistence would be intolerable, this crowning glory of human invention\r\nwhereby we can be blind and see at one and the same moment, this blessed\r\ninconsistency, exists here as elsewhere; and though the strictest writers\r\non morality have maintained that it is wicked for a woman to have\r\nchildren at all, inasmuch as it is wrong to be out of health that good\r\nmay come, yet the necessity of the case has caused a general feeling in\r\nfavour of passing over such events in silence, and of assuming their non-\r\nexistence except in such flagrant cases as force themselves on the public\r\nnotice.  Against these the condemnation of society is inexorable, and if\r\nit is believed that the illness has been dangerous and protracted, it is\r\nalmost impossible for a woman to recover her former position in society.\r\n\r\nThe above conventions struck me as arbitrary and cruel, but they put a\r\nstop to many fancied ailments; for the situation, so far from being\r\nconsidered interesting, is looked upon as savouring more or less\r\ndistinctly of a very reprehensible condition of things, and the ladies\r\ntake care to conceal it as long as they can even from their own husbands,\r\nin anticipation of a severe scolding as soon as the misdemeanour is\r\ndiscovered.  Also the baby is kept out of sight, except on the day of\r\nsigning the birth-formula, until it can walk and talk.  Should the child\r\nunhappily die, a coroner\'s inquest is inevitable, but in order to avoid\r\ndisgracing a family which may have been hitherto respected, it is almost\r\ninvariably found that the child was over seventy-five years old, and died\r\nfrom the decay of nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV: MAHAINA\r\n\r\n\r\nI continued my sojourn with the Nosnibors.  In a few days Mr. Nosnibor\r\nhad recovered from his flogging, and was looking forward with glee to the\r\nfact that the next would be the last.  I did not think that there seemed\r\nany occasion even for this; but he said it was better to be on the safe\r\nside, and he would make up the dozen.  He now went to his business as\r\nusual; and I understood that he was never more prosperous, in spite of\r\nhis heavy fine.  He was unable to give me much of his time during the\r\nday; for he was one of those valuable men who are paid, not by the year,\r\nmonth, week, or day, but by the minute.  His wife and daughters, however,\r\nmade much of me, and introduced me to their friends, who came in shoals\r\nto call upon me.\r\n\r\nOne of these persons was a lady called Mahaina.  Zulora (the elder of my\r\nhost\'s daughters) ran up to her and embraced her as soon as she entered\r\nthe room, at the same time inquiring tenderly after her "poor\r\ndipsomania."  Mahaina answered that it was just as bad as ever; she was a\r\nperfect martyr to it, and her excellent health was the only thing which\r\nconsoled her under her affliction.\r\n\r\nThen the other ladies joined in with condolences and the never-failing\r\nsuggestions which they had ready for every mental malady.  They\r\nrecommended their own straightener and disparaged Mahaina\'s.  Mrs.\r\nNosnibor had a favourite nostrum, but I could catch little of its nature.\r\nI heard the words "full confidence that the desire to drink will cease\r\nwhen the formula has been repeated * * * this confidence is _everything_\r\n* * * far from undervaluing a thorough determination never to touch\r\nspirits again * * * fail too often * * * formula a _certain cure_ (with\r\ngreat emphasis) * * * prescribed form * * * full conviction."  The\r\nconversation then became more audible, and was carried on at considerable\r\nlength.  I should perplex myself and the reader by endeavouring to follow\r\nthe ingenious perversity of all they said; enough, that in the course of\r\ntime the visit came to an end, and Mahaina took her leave receiving\r\naffectionate embraces from all the ladies.  I had remained in the\r\nbackground after the first ceremony of introduction, for I did not like\r\nthe looks of Mahaina, and the conversation displeased me.  When she left\r\nthe room I had some consolation in the remarks called forth by her\r\ndeparture.\r\n\r\nAt first they fell to praising her very demurely.  She was all this that\r\nand the other, till I disliked her more and more at every word, and\r\ninquired how it was that the straighteners had not been able to cure her\r\nas they had cured Mr. Nosnibor.\r\n\r\nThere was a shade of significance on Mrs. Nosnibor\'s face as I said this,\r\nwhich seemed to imply that she did not consider Mahaina\'s case to be\r\nquite one for a straightener.  It flashed across me that perhaps the poor\r\nwoman did not drink at all.  I knew that I ought not to have inquired,\r\nbut I could not help it, and asked point blank whether she did or not.\r\n\r\n"We can none of us judge of the condition of other people," said Mrs.\r\nNosnibor in a gravely charitable tone and with a look towards Zulora.\r\n\r\n"Oh, mamma," answered Zulora, pretending to be half angry but rejoiced at\r\nbeing able to say out what she was already longing to insinuate; "I don\'t\r\nbelieve a word of it.  It\'s all indigestion.  I remember staying in the\r\nhouse with her for a whole month last summer, and I am sure she never\r\nonce touched a drop of wine or spirits.  The fact is, Mahaina is a very\r\nweakly girl, and she pretends to get tipsy in order to win a forbearance\r\nfrom her friends to which she is not entitled.  She is not strong enough\r\nfor her calisthenic exercises, and she knows she would be made to do them\r\nunless her inability was referred to moral causes."\r\n\r\nHere the younger sister, who was ever sweet and kind, remarked that she\r\nthought Mahaina did tipple occasionally.  "I also think," she added,\r\n"that she sometimes takes poppy juice."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, perhaps she does drink sometimes," said Zulora; "but she\r\nwould make us all think that she does it much oftener in order to hide\r\nher weakness."\r\n\r\nAnd so they went on for half an hour and more, bandying about the\r\nquestion as to how far their late visitor\'s intemperance was real or no.\r\nEvery now and then they would join in some charitable commonplace, and\r\nwould pretend to be all of one mind that Mahaina was a person whose\r\nbodily health would be excellent if it were not for her unfortunate\r\ninability to refrain from excessive drinking; but as soon as this\r\nappeared to be fairly settled they began to be uncomfortable until they\r\nhad undone their work and left some serious imputation upon her\r\nconstitution.  At last, seeing that the debate had assumed the character\r\nof a cyclone or circular storm, going round and round and round and round\r\ntill one could never say where it began nor where it ended, I made some\r\napology for an abrupt departure and retired to my own room.\r\n\r\nHere at least I was alone, but I was very unhappy.  I had fallen upon a\r\nset of people who, in spite of their high civilisation and many\r\nexcellences, had been so warped by the mistaken views presented to them\r\nduring childhood from generation to generation, that it was impossible to\r\nsee how they could ever clear themselves.  Was there nothing which I\r\ncould say to make them feel that the constitution of a person\'s body was\r\na thing over which he or she had had at any rate no initial control\r\nwhatever, while the mind was a perfectly different thing, and capable of\r\nbeing created anew and directed according to the pleasure of its\r\npossessor?  Could I never bring them to see that while habits of mind and\r\ncharacter were entirely independent of initial mental force and early\r\neducation, the body was so much a creature of parentage and\r\ncircumstances, that no punishment for ill-health should be ever tolerated\r\nsave as a protection from contagion, and that even where punishment was\r\ninevitable it should be attended with compassion?  Surely, if the\r\nunfortunate Mahaina were to feel that she could avow her bodily weakness\r\nwithout fear of being despised for her infirmities, and if there were\r\nmedical men to whom she could fairly state her case, she would not\r\nhesitate about doing so through the fear of taking nasty medicine.  It\r\nwas possible that her malady was incurable (for I had heard enough to\r\nconvince me that her dipsomania was only a pretence and that she was\r\ntemperate in all her habits); in that case she might perhaps be justly\r\nsubject to annoyances or even to restraint; but who could say whether she\r\nwas curable or not, until she was able to make a clean breast of her\r\nsymptoms instead of concealing them?  In their eagerness to stamp out\r\ndisease, these people overshot their mark; for people had become so\r\nclever at dissembling--they painted their faces with such consummate\r\nskill--they repaired the decay of time and the effects of mischance with\r\nsuch profound dissimulation--that it was really impossible to say whether\r\nany one was well or ill till after an intimate acquaintance of months or\r\nyears.  Even then the shrewdest were constantly mistaken in their\r\njudgements, and marriages were often contracted with most deplorable\r\nresults, owing to the art with which infirmity had been concealed.\r\n\r\nIt appeared to me that the first step towards the cure of disease should\r\nbe the announcement of the fact to a person\'s near relations and friends.\r\nIf any one had a headache, he ought to be permitted within reasonable\r\nlimits to say so at once, and to retire to his own bedroom and take a\r\npill, without every one\'s looking grave and tears being shed and all the\r\nrest of it.  As it was, even upon hearing it whispered that somebody else\r\nwas subject to headaches, a whole company must look as though they had\r\nnever had a headache in their lives.  It is true they were not very\r\nprevalent, for the people were the healthiest and most comely imaginable,\r\nowing to the severity with which ill health was treated; still, even the\r\nbest were liable to be out of sorts sometimes, and there were few\r\nfamilies that had not a medicine-chest in a cupboard somewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV: THE MUSICAL BANKS\r\n\r\n\r\nOn my return to the drawing-room, I found that the Mahaina current had\r\nexpended itself.  The ladies were just putting away their work and\r\npreparing to go out.  I asked them where they were going.  They answered\r\nwith a certain air of reserve that they were going to the bank to get\r\nsome money.\r\n\r\nNow I had already collected that the mercantile affairs of the\r\nErewhonians were conducted on a totally different system from our own; I\r\nhad, however, gathered little hitherto, except that they had two distinct\r\ncommercial systems, of which the one appealed more strongly to the\r\nimagination than anything to which we are accustomed in Europe, inasmuch\r\nas the banks that were conducted upon this system were decorated in the\r\nmost profuse fashion, and all mercantile transactions were accompanied\r\nwith music, so that they were called Musical Banks, though the music was\r\nhideous to a European ear.\r\n\r\nAs for the system itself I never understood it, neither can I do so now:\r\nthey have a code in connection with it, which I have not the slightest\r\ndoubt that they understand, but no foreigner can hope to do so.  One rule\r\nruns into, and against, another as in a most complicated grammar, or as\r\nin Chinese pronunciation, wherein I am told that the slightest change in\r\naccentuation or tone of voice alters the meaning of a whole sentence.\r\nWhatever is incoherent in my description must be referred to the fact of\r\nmy never having attained to a full comprehension of the subject.\r\n\r\nSo far, however, as I could collect anything certain, I gathered that\r\nthey have two distinct currencies, each under the control of its own\r\nbanks and mercantile codes.  One of these (the one with the Musical\r\nBanks) was supposed to be _the_ system, and to give out the currency in\r\nwhich all monetary transactions should be carried on; and as far as I\r\ncould see, all who wished to be considered respectable, kept a larger or\r\nsmaller balance at these banks.  On the other hand, if there is one thing\r\nof which I am more sure than another, it is that the amount so kept had\r\nno direct commercial value in the outside world; I am sure that the\r\nmanagers and cashiers of the Musical Banks were not paid in their own\r\ncurrency.  Mr. Nosnibor used to go to these banks, or rather to the great\r\nmother bank of the city, sometimes but not very often.  He was a pillar\r\nof one of the other kind of banks, though he appeared to hold some minor\r\noffice also in the musical ones.  The ladies generally went alone; as\r\nindeed was the case in most families, except on state occasions.\r\n\r\nI had long wanted to know more of this strange system, and had the\r\ngreatest desire to accompany my hostess and her daughters.  I had seen\r\nthem go out almost every morning since my arrival and had noticed that\r\nthey carried their purses in their hands, not exactly ostentatiously, yet\r\njust so as that those who met them should see whither they were going.  I\r\nhad never, however, yet been asked to go with them myself.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to convey a person\'s manner by words, and I can hardly\r\ngive any idea of the peculiar feeling that came upon me when I saw the\r\nladies on the point of starting for the bank.  There was a something of\r\nregret, a something as though they would wish to take me with them, but\r\ndid not like to ask me, and yet as though I were hardly to ask to be\r\ntaken.  I was determined, however, to bring matters to an issue with my\r\nhostess about my going with them, and after a little parleying, and many\r\ninquiries as to whether I was perfectly sure that I myself wished to go,\r\nit was decided that I might do so.\r\n\r\nWe passed through several streets of more or less considerable houses,\r\nand at last turning round a corner we came upon a large piazza, at the\r\nend of which was a magnificent building, of a strange but noble\r\narchitecture and of great antiquity.  It did not open directly on to the\r\npiazza, there being a screen, through which was an archway, between the\r\npiazza and the actual precincts of the bank.  On passing under the\r\narchway we entered upon a green sward, round which there ran an arcade or\r\ncloister, while in front of us uprose the majestic towers of the bank and\r\nits venerable front, which was divided into three deep recesses and\r\nadorned with all sorts of marbles and many sculptures.  On either side\r\nthere were beautiful old trees wherein the birds were busy by the\r\nhundred, and a number of quaint but substantial houses of singularly\r\ncomfortable appearance; they were situated in the midst of orchards and\r\ngardens, and gave me an impression of great peace and plenty.\r\n\r\nIndeed it had been no error to say that this building was one that\r\nappealed to the imagination; it did more--it carried both imagination and\r\njudgement by storm.  It was an epic in stone and marble, and so powerful\r\nwas the effect it produced on me, that as I beheld it I was charmed and\r\nmelted.  I felt more conscious of the existence of a remote past.  One\r\nknows of this always, but the knowledge is never so living as in the\r\nactual presence of some witness to the life of bygone ages.  I felt how\r\nshort a space of human life was the period of our own existence.  I was\r\nmore impressed with my own littleness, and much more inclinable to\r\nbelieve that the people whose sense of the fitness of things was equal to\r\nthe upraising of so serene a handiwork, were hardly likely to be wrong in\r\nthe conclusions they might come to upon any subject.  My feeling\r\ncertainly was that the currency of this bank must be the right one.\r\n\r\nWe crossed the sward and entered the building.  If the outside had been\r\nimpressive the inside was even more so.  It was very lofty and divided\r\ninto several parts by walls which rested upon massive pillars; the\r\nwindows were filled with stained glass descriptive of the principal\r\ncommercial incidents of the bank for many ages.  In a remote part of the\r\nbuilding there were men and boys singing; this was the only disturbing\r\nfeature, for as the gamut was still unknown, there was no music in the\r\ncountry which could be agreeable to a European ear.  The singers seemed\r\nto have derived their inspirations from the songs of birds and the\r\nwailing of the wind, which last they tried to imitate in melancholy\r\ncadences that at times degenerated into a howl.  To my thinking the noise\r\nwas hideous, but it produced a great effect upon my companions, who\r\nprofessed themselves much moved.  As soon as the singing was over, the\r\nladies requested me to stay where I was while they went inside the place\r\nfrom which it had seemed to come.\r\n\r\nDuring their absence certain reflections forced themselves upon me.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it struck me as strange that the building should be\r\nso nearly empty; I was almost alone, and the few besides myself had been\r\nled by curiosity, and had no intention of doing business with the bank.\r\nBut there might be more inside.  I stole up to the curtain, and ventured\r\nto draw the extreme edge of it on one side.  No, there was hardly any one\r\nthere.  I saw a large number of cashiers, all at their desks ready to pay\r\ncheques, and one or two who seemed to be the managing partners.  I also\r\nsaw my hostess and her daughters and two or three other ladies; also\r\nthree or four old women and the boys from one of the neighbouring\r\nColleges of Unreason; but there was no one else.  This did not look as\r\nthough the bank was doing a very large business; and yet I had always\r\nbeen told that every one in the city dealt with this establishment.\r\n\r\nI cannot describe all that took place in these inner precincts, for a\r\nsinister-looking person in a black gown came and made unpleasant gestures\r\nat me for peeping.  I happened to have in my pocket one of the Musical\r\nBank pieces, which had been given me by Mrs. Nosnibor, so I tried to tip\r\nhim with it; but having seen what it was, he became so angry that I had\r\nto give him a piece of the other kind of money to pacify him.  When I had\r\ndone this he became civil directly.  As soon as he was gone I ventured to\r\ntake a second look, and saw Zulora in the very act of giving a piece of\r\npaper which looked like a cheque to one of the cashiers.  He did not\r\nexamine it, but putting his hand into an antique coffer hard by, he\r\npulled out a quantity of metal pieces apparently at random, and handed\r\nthem over without counting them; neither did Zulora count them, but put\r\nthem into her purse and went back to her seat after dropping a few pieces\r\nof the other coinage into an alms box that stood by the cashier\'s side.\r\nMrs. Nosnibor and Arowhena then did likewise, but a little later they\r\ngave all (so far as I could see) that they had received from the cashier\r\nback to a verger, who I have no doubt put it back into the coffer from\r\nwhich it had been taken.  They then began making towards the curtain;\r\nwhereon I let it drop and retreated to a reasonable distance.\r\n\r\nThey soon joined me.  For some few minutes we all kept silence, but at\r\nlast I ventured to remark that the bank was not so busy to-day as it\r\nprobably often was.  On this Mrs. Nosnibor said that it was indeed\r\nmelancholy to see what little heed people paid to the most precious of\r\nall institutions.  I could say nothing in reply, but I have ever been of\r\nopinion that the greater part of mankind do approximately know where they\r\nget that which does them good.\r\n\r\nMrs. Nosnibor went on to say that I must not think there was any want of\r\nconfidence in the bank because I had seen so few people there; the heart\r\nof the country was thoroughly devoted to these establishments, and any\r\nsign of their being in danger would bring in support from the most\r\nunexpected quarters.  It was only because people knew them to be so very\r\nsafe, that in some cases (as she lamented to say in Mr. Nosnibor\'s) they\r\nfelt that their support was unnecessary.  Moreover these institutions\r\nnever departed from the safest and most approved banking principles.  Thus\r\nthey never allowed interest on deposit, a thing now frequently done by\r\ncertain bubble companies, which by doing an illegitimate trade had drawn\r\nmany customers away; and even the shareholders were fewer than formerly,\r\nowing to the innovations of these unscrupulous persons, for the Musical\r\nBanks paid little or no dividend, but divided their profits by way of\r\nbonus on the original shares once in every thirty thousand years; and as\r\nit was now only two thousand years since there had been one of these\r\ndistributions, people felt that they could not hope for another in their\r\nown time and preferred investments whereby they got some more tangible\r\nreturn; all which, she said, was very melancholy to think of.\r\n\r\nHaving made these last admissions, she returned to her original\r\nstatement, namely, that every one in the country really supported these\r\nbanks.  As to the fewness of the people, and the absence of the\r\nable-bodied, she pointed out to me with some justice that this was\r\nexactly what we ought to expect.  The men who were most conversant about\r\nthe stability of human institutions, such as the lawyers, men of science,\r\ndoctors, statesmen, painters, and the like, were just those who were most\r\nlikely to be misled by their own fancied accomplishments, and to be made\r\nunduly suspicious by their licentious desire for greater present return,\r\nwhich was at the root of nine-tenths of the opposition; by their vanity,\r\nwhich would prompt them to affect superiority to the prejudices of the\r\nvulgar; and by the stings of their own conscience, which was constantly\r\nupbraiding them in the most cruel manner on account of their bodies,\r\nwhich were generally diseased.\r\n\r\nLet a person\'s intellect (she continued) be never so sound, unless his\r\nbody is in absolute health, he can form no judgement worth having on\r\nmatters of this kind.  The body is everything: it need not perhaps be\r\nsuch a strong body (she said this because she saw that I was thinking of\r\nthe old and infirm-looking folks whom I had seen in the bank), but it\r\nmust be in perfect health; in this case, the less active strength it had\r\nthe more free would be the working of the intellect, and therefore the\r\nsounder the conclusion.  The people, then, whom I had seen at the bank\r\nwere in reality the very ones whose opinions were most worth having; they\r\ndeclared its advantages to be incalculable, and even professed to\r\nconsider the immediate return to be far larger than they were entitled\r\nto; and so she ran on, nor did she leave off till we had got back to the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nShe might say what she pleased, but her manner carried no conviction, and\r\nlater on I saw signs of general indifference to these banks that were not\r\nto be mistaken.  Their supporters often denied it, but the denial was\r\ngenerally so couched as to add another proof of its existence.  In\r\ncommercial panics, and in times of general distress, the people as a mass\r\ndid not so much as even think of turning to these banks.  A few might do\r\nso, some from habit and early training, some from the instinct that\r\nprompts us to catch at any straw when we think ourselves drowning, but\r\nfew from a genuine belief that the Musical Banks could save them from\r\nfinancial ruin, if they were unable to meet their engagements in the\r\nother kind of currency.\r\n\r\nIn conversation with one of the Musical Bank managers I ventured to hint\r\nthis as plainly as politeness would allow.  He said that it had been more\r\nor less true till lately; but that now they had put fresh stained glass\r\nwindows into all the banks in the country, and repaired the buildings,\r\nand enlarged the organs; the presidents, moreover, had taken to riding in\r\nomnibuses and talking nicely to people in the streets, and to remembering\r\nthe ages of their children, and giving them things when they were\r\nnaughty, so that all would henceforth go smoothly.\r\n\r\n"But haven\'t you done anything to the money itself?" said I, timidly.\r\n\r\n"It is not necessary," he rejoined; "not in the least necessary, I assure\r\nyou."\r\n\r\nAnd yet any one could see that the money given out at these banks was not\r\nthat with which people bought their bread, meat, and clothing.  It was\r\nlike it at a first glance, and was stamped with designs that were often\r\nof great beauty; it was not, again, a spurious coinage, made with the\r\nintention that it should be mistaken for the money in actual use; it was\r\nmore like a toy money, or the counters used for certain games at cards;\r\nfor, notwithstanding the beauty of the designs, the material on which\r\nthey were stamped was as nearly valueless as possible.  Some were covered\r\nwith tin foil, but the greater part were frankly of a cheap base metal\r\nthe exact nature of which I was not able to determine.  Indeed they were\r\nmade of a great variety of metals, or, perhaps more accurately, alloys,\r\nsome of which were hard, while others would bend easily and assume almost\r\nany form which their possessor might desire at the moment.\r\n\r\nOf course every one knew that their commercial value was _nil_, but all\r\nthose who wished to be considered respectable thought it incumbent upon\r\nthem to retain a few coins in their possession, and to let them be seen\r\nfrom time to time in their hands and purses.  Not only this, but they\r\nwould stick to it that the current coin of the realm was dross in\r\ncomparison with the Musical Bank coinage.  Perhaps, however, the\r\nstrangest thing of all was that these very people would at times make fun\r\nin small ways of the whole system; indeed, there was hardly any\r\ninsinuation against it which they would not tolerate and even applaud in\r\ntheir daily newspapers if written anonymously, while if the same thing\r\nwere said without ambiguity to their faces--nominative case verb and\r\naccusative being all in their right places, and doubt impossible--they\r\nwould consider themselves very seriously and justly outraged, and accuse\r\nthe speaker of being unwell.\r\n\r\nI never could understand (neither can I quite do so now, though I begin\r\nto see better what they mean) why a single currency should not suffice\r\nthem; it would seem to me as though all their dealings would have been\r\nthus greatly simplified; but I was met with a look of horror if ever I\r\ndared to hint at it.  Even those who to my certain knowledge kept only\r\njust enough money at the Musical Banks to swear by, would call the other\r\nbanks (where their securities really lay) cold, deadening, paralysing,\r\nand the like.\r\n\r\nI noticed another thing, moreover, which struck me greatly.  I was taken\r\nto the opening of one of these banks in a neighbouring town, and saw a\r\nlarge assemblage of cashiers and managers.  I sat opposite them and\r\nscanned their faces attentively.  They did not please me; they lacked,\r\nwith few exceptions, the true Erewhonian frankness; and an equal number\r\nfrom any other class would have looked happier and better men.  When I\r\nmet them in the streets they did not seem like other people, but had, as\r\na general rule, a cramped expression upon their faces which pained and\r\ndepressed me.\r\n\r\nThose who came from the country were better; they seemed to have lived\r\nless as a separate class, and to be freer and healthier; but in spite of\r\nmy seeing not a few whose looks were benign and noble, I could not help\r\nasking myself concerning the greater number of those whom I met, whether\r\nErewhon would be a better country if their expression were to be\r\ntransferred to the people in general.  I answered myself emphatically,\r\nno.  The expression on the faces of the high Ydgrunites was that which\r\none would wish to diffuse, and not that of the cashiers.\r\n\r\nA man\'s expression is his sacrament; it is the outward and visible sign\r\nof his inward and spiritual grace, or want of grace; and as I looked at\r\nthe a majority of these men, I could not help feeling that there must be\r\na something in their lives which had stunted their natural development,\r\nand that they would have been more healthily minded in any other\r\nprofession.  I was always sorry for them, for in nine cases out of ten\r\nthey were well-meaning persons; they were in the main very poorly paid;\r\ntheir constitutions were as a rule above suspicion; and there were\r\nrecorded numberless instances of their self-sacrifice and generosity; but\r\nthey had had the misfortune to have been betrayed into a false position\r\nat an age for the most part when their judgement was not matured, and\r\nafter having been kept in studied ignorance of the real difficulties of\r\nthe system.  But this did not make their position the less a false one,\r\nand its bad effects upon themselves were unmistakable.\r\n\r\nFew people would speak quite openly and freely before them, which struck\r\nme as a very bad sign.  When they were in the room every one would talk\r\nas though all currency save that of the Musical Banks should be\r\nabolished; and yet they knew perfectly well that even the cashiers\r\nthemselves hardly used the Musical Bank money more than other people.  It\r\nwas expected of them that they should appear to do so, but this was all.\r\nThe less thoughtful of them did not seem particularly unhappy, but many\r\nwere plainly sick at heart, though perhaps they hardly knew it, and would\r\nnot have owned to being so.  Some few were opponents of the whole system;\r\nbut these were liable to be dismissed from their employment at any\r\nmoment, and this rendered them very careful, for a man who had once been\r\ncashier at a Musical Bank was out of the field for other employment, and\r\nwas generally unfitted for it by reason of that course of treatment which\r\nwas commonly called his education.  In fact it was a career from which\r\nretreat was virtually impossible, and into which young men were generally\r\ninduced to enter before they could be reasonably expected, considering\r\ntheir training, to have formed any opinions of their own.  Not\r\nunfrequently, indeed, they were induced, by what we in England should\r\ncall undue influence, concealment, and fraud.  Few indeed were those who\r\nhad the courage to insist on seeing both sides of the question before\r\nthey committed themselves to what was practically a leap in the dark.  One\r\nwould have thought that caution in this respect was an elementary\r\nprinciple,--one of the first things that an honourable man would teach\r\nhis boy to understand; but in practice it was not so.\r\n\r\nI even saw cases in which parents bought the right of presenting to the\r\noffice of cashier at one of these banks, with the fixed determination\r\nthat some one of their sons (perhaps a mere child) should fill it.  There\r\nwas the lad himself--growing up with every promise of becoming a good and\r\nhonourable man--but utterly without warning concerning the iron shoe\r\nwhich his natural protector was providing for him.  Who could say that\r\nthe whole thing would not end in a life-long lie, and vain chafing to\r\nescape?  I confess that there were few things in Erewhon which shocked me\r\nmore than this.\r\n\r\nYet we do something not so very different from this even in England, and\r\nas regards the dual commercial system, all countries have, and have had,\r\na law of the land, and also another law, which, though professedly more\r\nsacred, has far less effect on their daily life and actions.  It seems as\r\nthough the need for some law over and above, and sometimes even\r\nconflicting with, the law of the land, must spring from something that\r\nlies deep down in man\'s nature; indeed, it is hard to think that man\r\ncould ever have become man at all, but for the gradual evolution of a\r\nperception that though this world looms so large when we are in it, it\r\nmay seem a little thing when we have got away from it.\r\n\r\nWhen man had grown to the perception that in the everlasting Is-and-Is-\r\nNot of nature, the world and all that it contains, including man, is at\r\nthe same time both seen and unseen, he felt the need of two rules of\r\nlife, one for the seen, and the other for the unseen side of things.  For\r\nthe laws affecting the seen world he claimed the sanction of seen powers;\r\nfor the unseen (of which he knows nothing save that it exists and is\r\npowerful) he appealed to the unseen power (of which, again, he knows\r\nnothing save that it exists and is powerful) to which he gives the name\r\nof God.\r\n\r\nSome Erewhonian opinions concerning the intelligence of the unborn\r\nembryo, that I regret my space will not permit me to lay before the\r\nreader, have led me to conclude that the Erewhonian Musical Banks, and\r\nperhaps the religious systems of all countries, are now more or less of\r\nan attempt to uphold the unfathomable and unconscious instinctive wisdom\r\nof millions of past generations, against the comparatively shallow,\r\nconsciously reasoning, and ephemeral conclusions drawn from that of the\r\nlast thirty or forty.\r\n\r\nThe saving feature of the Erewhonian Musical Bank system (as distinct\r\nfrom the quasi-idolatrous views which coexist with it, and on which I\r\nwill touch later) was that while it bore witness to the existence of a\r\nkingdom that is not of this world, it made no attempt to pierce the veil\r\nthat hides it from human eyes.  It is here that almost all religions go\r\nwrong.  Their priests try to make us believe that they know more about\r\nthe unseen world than those whose eyes are still blinded by the seen, can\r\never know--forgetting that while to deny the existence of an unseen\r\nkingdom is bad, to pretend that we know more about it than its bare\r\nexistence is no better.\r\n\r\nThis chapter is already longer than I intended, but I should like to say\r\nthat in spite of the saving feature of which I have just spoken, I cannot\r\nhelp thinking that the Erewhonians are on the eve of some great change in\r\ntheir religious opinions, or at any rate in that part of them which finds\r\nexpression through their Musical Banks.  So far as I could see, fully\r\nninety per cent. of the population of the metropolis looked upon these\r\nbanks with something not far removed from contempt.  If this is so, any\r\nsuch startling event as is sure to arise sooner or later, may serve as\r\nnucleus to a new order of things that will be more in harmony with both\r\nthe heads and hearts of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI: AROWHENA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reader will perhaps have learned by this time a thing which I had\r\nmyself suspected before I had been twenty-four hours in Mr. Nosnibor\'s\r\nhouse--I mean, that though the Nosnibors showed me every attention, I\r\ncould not cordially like them, with the exception of Arowhena who was\r\nquite different from the rest.  They were not fair samples of\r\nErewhonians.  I saw many families with whom they were on visiting terms,\r\nwhose manners charmed me more than I know how to say, but I never could\r\nget over my original prejudice against Mr. Nosnibor for having embezzled\r\nthe money.  Mrs. Nosnibor, too, was a very worldly woman, yet to hear her\r\ntalk one would have thought that she was singularly the reverse; neither\r\ncould I endure Zulora; Arowhena however was perfection.\r\n\r\nShe it was who ran all the little errands for her mother and Mr. Nosnibor\r\nand Zulora, and gave those thousand proofs of sweetness and unselfishness\r\nwhich some one member of a family is generally required to give.  All day\r\nlong it was Arowhena this, and Arowhena that; but she never seemed to\r\nknow that she was being put upon, and was always bright and willing from\r\nmorning till evening.  Zulora certainly was very handsome, but Arowhena\r\nwas infinitely the more graceful of the two and was the very _ne plus\r\nultra_ of youth and beauty.  I will not attempt to describe her, for\r\nanything that I could say would fall so far short of the reality as only\r\nto mislead the reader.  Let him think of the very loveliest that he can\r\nimagine, and he will still be below the truth.  Having said this much, I\r\nneed hardly say that I had fallen in love with her.\r\n\r\nShe must have seen what I felt for her, but I tried my hardest not to let\r\nit appear even by the slightest sign.  I had many reasons for this.  I\r\nhad no idea what Mr. and Mrs. Nosnibor would say to it; and I knew that\r\nArowhena would not look at me (at any rate not yet) if her father and\r\nmother disapproved, which they probably would, considering that I had\r\nnothing except the pension of about a pound a day of our money which the\r\nKing had granted me.  I did not yet know of a more serious obstacle.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, I may say that I had been presented at court, and was\r\ntold that my reception had been considered as singularly gracious;\r\nindeed, I had several interviews both with the King and Queen, at which\r\nfrom time to time the Queen got everything from me that I had in the\r\nworld, clothes and all, except the two buttons I had given to Yram, the\r\nloss of which seemed to annoy her a good deal.  I was presented with a\r\ncourt suit, and her Majesty had my old clothes put upon a wooden dummy,\r\non which they probably remain, unless they have been removed in\r\nconsequence of my subsequent downfall.  His Majesty\'s manners were those\r\nof a cultivated English gentleman.  He was much pleased at hearing that\r\nour government was monarchical, and that the mass of the people were\r\nresolute that it should not be changed; indeed, I was so much encouraged\r\nby the evident pleasure with which he heard me, that I ventured to quote\r\nto him those beautiful lines of Shakespeare\'s--\r\n\r\n   "There\'s a divinity doth hedge a king,\r\n   Rough hew him how we may;"\r\n\r\nbut I was sorry I had done so afterwards, for I do not think his Majesty\r\nadmired the lines as much as I could have wished.\r\n\r\nThere is no occasion for me to dwell further upon my experience of the\r\ncourt, but I ought perhaps to allude to one of my conversations with the\r\nKing, inasmuch as it was pregnant with the most important consequences.\r\n\r\nHe had been asking me about my watch, and enquiring whether such\r\ndangerous inventions were tolerated in the country from which I came.  I\r\nowned with some confusion that watches were not uncommon; but observing\r\nthe gravity which came over his Majesty\'s face I presumed to say that\r\nthey were fast dying out, and that we had few if any other mechanical\r\ncontrivances of which he was likely to disapprove.  Upon his asking me to\r\nname some of our most advanced machines, I did not dare to tell him of\r\nour steam-engines and railroads and electric telegraphs, and was puzzling\r\nmy brains to think what I could say, when, of all things in the world,\r\nballoons suggested themselves, and I gave him an account of a very\r\nremarkable ascent which was made some years ago.  The King was too polite\r\nto contradict, but I felt sure that he did not believe me, and from that\r\nday forward though he always showed me the attention which was due to my\r\ngenius (for in this light was my complexion regarded), he never\r\nquestioned me about the manners and customs of my country.\r\n\r\nTo return, however, to Arowhena.  I soon gathered that neither Mr. nor\r\nMrs. Nosnibor would have any objection to my marrying into the family; a\r\nphysical excellence is considered in Erewhon as a set off against almost\r\nany other disqualification, and my light hair was sufficient to make me\r\nan eligible match.  But along with this welcome fact I gathered another\r\nwhich filled me with dismay: I was expected to marry Zulora, for whom I\r\nhad already conceived a great aversion.  At first I hardly noticed the\r\nlittle hints and the artifices which were resorted to in order to bring\r\nus together, but after a time they became too plain.  Zulora, whether she\r\nwas in love with me or not, was bent on marrying me, and I gathered in\r\ntalking with a young gentleman of my acquaintance who frequently visited\r\nthe house and whom I greatly disliked, that it was considered a sacred\r\nand inviolable rule that whoever married into a family must marry the\r\neldest daughter at that time unmarried.  The young gentleman urged this\r\nupon me so frequently that I at last saw he was in love with Arowhena\r\nhimself, and wanted me to get Zulora out of the way; but others told me\r\nthe same story as to the custom of the country, and I saw there was a\r\nserious difficulty.  My only comfort was that Arowhena snubbed my rival\r\nand would not look at him.  Neither would she look at me; nevertheless\r\nthere was a difference in the manner of her disregard; this was all I\r\ncould get from her.\r\n\r\nNot that she avoided me; on the contrary I had many a tete-a-tete with\r\nher, for her mother and sister were anxious for me to deposit some part\r\nof my pension in the Musical Banks, this being in accordance with the\r\ndictates of their goddess Ydgrun, of whom both Mrs. Nosnibor and Zulora\r\nwere great devotees.  I was not sure whether I had kept my secret from\r\nbeing perceived by Arowhena herself, but none of the others suspected me,\r\nso she was set upon me to get me to open an account, at any rate _pro\r\nforma_, with the Musical Banks; and I need hardly say that she succeeded.\r\nBut I did not yield at once; I enjoyed the process of being argued with\r\ntoo keenly to lose it by a prompt concession; besides, a little\r\nhesitation rendered the concession itself more valuable.  It was in the\r\ncourse of conversations on this subject that I learned the more defined\r\nreligious opinions of the Erewhonians, that coexist with the Musical Bank\r\nsystem, but are not recognised by those curious institutions.  I will\r\ndescribe them as briefly as possible in the following chapters before I\r\nreturn to the personal adventures of Arowhena and myself.\r\n\r\nThey were idolaters, though of a comparatively enlightened kind; but\r\nhere, as in other things, there was a discrepancy between their professed\r\nand actual belief, for they had a genuine and potent faith which existed\r\nwithout recognition alongside of their idol worship.\r\n\r\nThe gods whom they worship openly are personifications of human\r\nqualities, as justice, strength, hope, fear, love, &c., &c.  The people\r\nthink that prototypes of these have a real objective existence in a\r\nregion far beyond the clouds, holding, as did the ancients, that they are\r\nlike men and women both in body and passion, except that they are even\r\ncomelier and more powerful, and also that they can render themselves\r\ninvisible to human eyesight.  They are capable of being propitiated by\r\nmankind and of coming to the assistance of those who ask their aid.  Their\r\ninterest in human affairs is keen, and on the whole beneficent; but they\r\nbecome very angry if neglected, and punish rather the first they come\r\nupon, than the actual person who has offended them; their fury being\r\nblind when it is raised, though never raised without reason.  They will\r\nnot punish with any less severity when people sin against them from\r\nignorance, and without the chance of having had knowledge; they will take\r\nno excuses of this kind, but are even as the English law, which assumes\r\nitself to be known to every one.\r\n\r\nThus they have a law that two pieces of matter may not occupy the same\r\nspace at the same moment, which law is presided over and administered by\r\nthe gods of time and space jointly, so that if a flying stone and a man\'s\r\nhead attempt to outrage these gods, by "arrogating a right which they do\r\nnot possess" (for so it is written in one of their books), and to occupy\r\nthe same space simultaneously, a severe punishment, sometimes even death\r\nitself, is sure to follow, without any regard to whether the stone knew\r\nthat the man\'s head was there, or the head the stone; this at least is\r\ntheir view of the common accidents of life.  Moreover, they hold their\r\ndeities to be quite regardless of motives.  With them it is the thing\r\ndone which is everything, and the motive goes for nothing.\r\n\r\nThus they hold it strictly forbidden for a man to go without common air\r\nin his lungs for more than a very few minutes; and if by any chance he\r\ngets into the water, the air-god is very angry, and will not suffer it;\r\nno matter whether the man got into the water by accident or on purpose,\r\nwhether through the attempt to save a child or through presumptuous\r\ncontempt of the air-god, the air-god will kill him, unless he keeps his\r\nhead high enough out of the water, and thus gives the air-god his due.\r\n\r\nThis with regard to the deities who manage physical affairs.  Over and\r\nabove these they personify hope, fear, love, and so forth, giving them\r\ntemples and priests, and carving likenesses of them in stone, which they\r\nverily believe to be faithful representations of living beings who are\r\nonly not human in being more than human.  If any one denies the objective\r\nexistence of these divinities, and says that there is really no such\r\nbeing as a beautiful woman called Justice, with her eyes blinded and a\r\npair of scales, positively living and moving in a remote and ethereal\r\nregion, but that justice is only the personified expression of certain\r\nmodes of human thought and action--they say that he denies the existence\r\nof justice in denying her personality, and that he is a wanton disturber\r\nof men\'s religious convictions.  They detest nothing so much as any\r\nattempt to lead them to higher spiritual conceptions of the deities whom\r\nthey profess to worship.  Arowhena and I had a pitched battle on this\r\npoint, and should have had many more but for my prudence in allowing her\r\nto get the better of me.\r\n\r\nI am sure that in her heart she was suspicious of her own position for\r\nshe returned more than once to the subject.  "Can you not see," I had\r\nexclaimed, "that the fact of justice being admirable will not be affected\r\nby the absence of a belief in her being also a living agent?  Can you\r\nreally think that men will be one whit less hopeful, because they no\r\nlonger believe that hope is an actual person?"  She shook her head, and\r\nsaid that with men\'s belief in the personality all incentive to the\r\nreverence of the thing itself, as justice or hope, would cease; men from\r\nthat hour would never be either just or hopeful again.\r\n\r\nI could not move her, nor, indeed, did I seriously wish to do so.  She\r\ndeferred to me in most things, but she never shrank from maintaining her\r\nopinions if they were put in question; nor does she to this day abate one\r\njot of her belief in the religion of her childhood, though in compliance\r\nwith my repeated entreaties she has allowed herself to be baptized into\r\nthe English Church.  She has, however, made a gloss upon her original\r\nfaith to the effect that her baby and I are the only human beings exempt\r\nfrom the vengeance of the deities for not believing in their personality.\r\nShe is quite clear that we are exempted.  She should never have so strong\r\na conviction of it otherwise.  How it has come about she does not know,\r\nneither does she wish to know; there are things which it is better not to\r\nknow and this is one of them; but when I tell her that I believe in her\r\ndeities as much as she does--and that it is a difference about words, not\r\nthings, she becomes silent with a slight emphasis.\r\n\r\nI own that she very nearly conquered me once; for she asked me what I\r\nshould think if she were to tell me that my God, whose nature and\r\nattributes I had been explaining to her, was but the expression for man\'s\r\nhighest conception of goodness, wisdom, and power; that in order to\r\ngenerate a more vivid conception of so great and glorious a thought, man\r\nhad personified it and called it by a name; that it was an unworthy\r\nconception of the Deity to hold Him personal, inasmuch as escape from\r\nhuman contingencies became thus impossible; that the real thing men\r\nshould worship was the Divine, whereinsoever they could find it; that\r\n"God" was but man\'s way of expressing his sense of the Divine; that as\r\njustice, hope, wisdom, &c., were all parts of goodness, so God was the\r\nexpression which embraced all goodness and all good power; that people\r\nwould no more cease to love God on ceasing to believe in His objective\r\npersonality, than they had ceased to love justice on discovering that she\r\nwas not really personal; nay, that they would never truly love Him till\r\nthey saw Him thus.\r\n\r\nShe said all this in her artless way, and with none of the coherence with\r\nwhich I have here written it; her face kindled, and she felt sure that\r\nshe had convinced me that I was wrong, and that justice was a living\r\nperson.  Indeed I did wince a little; but I recovered myself immediately,\r\nand pointed out to her that we had books whose genuineness was beyond all\r\npossibility of doubt, as they were certainly none of them less than 1800\r\nyears old; that in these there were the most authentic accounts of men\r\nwho had been spoken to by the Deity Himself, and of one prophet who had\r\nbeen allowed to see the back parts of God through the hand that was laid\r\nover his face.\r\n\r\nThis was conclusive; and I spoke with such solemnity that she was a\r\nlittle frightened, and only answered that they too had their books, in\r\nwhich their ancestors had seen the gods; on which I saw that further\r\nargument was not at all likely to convince her; and fearing that she\r\nmight tell her mother what I had been saying, and that I might lose the\r\nhold upon her affections which I was beginning to feel pretty sure that I\r\nwas obtaining, I began to let her have her own way, and to convince me;\r\nneither till after we were safely married did I show the cloven hoof\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, her remarks have haunted me, and I have since met with many\r\nvery godly people who have had a great knowledge of divinity, but no\r\nsense of the divine: and again, I have seen a radiance upon the face of\r\nthose who were worshipping the divine either in art or nature--in picture\r\nor statue--in field or cloud or sea--in man, woman, or child--which I\r\nhave never seen kindled by any talking about the nature and attributes of\r\nGod.  Mention but the word divinity, and our sense of the divine is\r\nclouded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII: YDGRUN AND THE YDGRUNITES\r\n\r\n\r\nIn spite of all the to-do they make about their idols, and the temples\r\nthey build, and the priests and priestesses whom they support, I could\r\nnever think that their professed religion was more than skin-deep; but\r\nthey had another which they carried with them into all their actions; and\r\nalthough no one from the outside of things would suspect it to have any\r\nexistence at all, it was in reality their great guide, the mariner\'s\r\ncompass of their lives; so that there were very few things which they\r\never either did, or refrained from doing, without reference to its\r\nprecepts.\r\n\r\nNow I suspected that their professed faith had no great hold upon\r\nthem--firstly, because I often heard the priests complain of the\r\nprevailing indifference, and they would hardly have done so without\r\nreason; secondly, because of the show which was made, for there was none\r\nof this about the worship of the goddess Ydgrun, in whom they really did\r\nbelieve; thirdly, because though the priests were constantly abusing\r\nYdgrun as being the great enemy of the gods, it was well known that she\r\nhad no more devoted worshippers in the whole country than these very\r\npersons, who were often priests of Ydgrun rather than of their own\r\ndeities.  Neither am I by any means sure that these were not the best of\r\nthe priests.\r\n\r\nYdgrun certainly occupied a very anomalous position; she was held to be\r\nboth omnipresent and omnipotent, but she was not an elevated conception,\r\nand was sometimes both cruel and absurd.  Even her most devoted\r\nworshippers were a little ashamed of her, and served her more with heart\r\nand in deed than with their tongues.  Theirs was no lip service; on the\r\ncontrary, even when worshipping her most devoutly, they would often deny\r\nher.  Take her all in all, however, she was a beneficent and useful\r\ndeity, who did not care how much she was denied so long as she was obeyed\r\nand feared, and who kept hundreds of thousands in those paths which make\r\nlife tolerably happy, who would never have been kept there otherwise, and\r\nover whom a higher and more spiritual ideal would have had no power.\r\n\r\nI greatly doubt whether the Erewhonians are yet prepared for any better\r\nreligion, and though (considering my gradually strengthened conviction\r\nthat they were the representatives of the lost tribes of Israel) I would\r\nhave set about converting them at all hazards had I seen the remotest\r\nprospect of success, I could hardly contemplate the displacement of\r\nYdgrun as the great central object of their regard without admitting that\r\nit would be attended with frightful consequences; in fact were I a mere\r\nphilosopher, I should say that the gradual raising of the popular\r\nconception of Ydgrun would be the greatest spiritual boon which could be\r\nconferred upon them, and that nothing could effect this except example.  I\r\ngenerally found that those who complained most loudly that Ydgrun was not\r\nhigh enough for them had hardly as yet come up to the Ydgrun standard,\r\nand I often met with a class of men whom I called to myself "high\r\nYdgrunites" (the rest being Ydgrunites, and low Ydgrunites), who, in the\r\nmatter of human conduct and the affairs of life, appeared to me to have\r\ngot about as far as it is in the right nature of man to go.\r\n\r\nThey were gentlemen in the full sense of the word; and what has one not\r\nsaid in saying this?  They seldom spoke of Ydgrun, or even alluded to\r\nher, but would never run counter to her dictates without ample reason for\r\ndoing so: in such cases they would override her with due self-reliance,\r\nand the goddess seldom punished them; for they are brave, and Ydgrun is\r\nnot.  They had most of them a smattering of the hypothetical language,\r\nand some few more than this, but only a few.  I do not think that this\r\nlanguage has had much hand in making them what they are; but rather that\r\nthe fact of their being generally possessed of its rudiments was one\r\ngreat reason for the reverence paid to the hypothetical language itself.\r\n\r\nBeing inured from youth to exercises and athletics of all sorts, and\r\nliving fearlessly under the eye of their peers, among whom there exists a\r\nhigh standard of courage, generosity, honour, and every good and manly\r\nquality--what wonder that they should have become, so to speak, a law\r\nunto themselves; and, while taking an elevated view of the goddess\r\nYdgrun, they should have gradually lost all faith in the recognised\r\ndeities of the country?  These they do not openly disregard, for\r\nconformity until absolutely intolerable is a law of Ydgrun, yet they have\r\nno real belief in the objective existence of beings which so readily\r\nexplain themselves as abstractions, and whose personality demands a quasi-\r\nmaterialism which it baffles the imagination to realise.  They keep their\r\nopinions, however, greatly to themselves, inasmuch as most of their\r\ncountrymen feel strongly about the gods, and they hold it wrong to give\r\npain, unless for some greater good than seems likely to arise from their\r\nplain speaking.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, surely those whose own minds are clear about any given\r\nmatter (even though it be only that there is little certainty) should go\r\nso far towards imparting that clearness to others, as to say openly what\r\nthey think and why they think it, whenever they can properly do so; for\r\nthey may be sure that they owe their own clearness almost entirely to the\r\nfact that others have done this by them: after all, they may be mistaken,\r\nand if so, it is for their own and the general well-being that they\r\nshould let their error be seen as distinctly as possible, so that it may\r\nbe more easily refuted.  I own, therefore, that on this one point I\r\ndisapproved of the practice even of the highest Ydgrunites, and objected\r\nto it all the more because I knew that I should find my own future task\r\nmore easy if the high Ydgrunites had already undermined the belief which\r\nis supposed to prevail at present.\r\n\r\nIn other respects they were more like the best class of Englishmen than\r\nany whom I have seen in other countries.  I should have liked to have\r\npersuaded half-a-dozen of them to come over to England and go upon the\r\nstage, for they had most of them a keen sense of humour and a taste for\r\nacting: they would be of great use to us.  The example of a real\r\ngentleman is, if I may say so without profanity, the best of all gospels;\r\nsuch a man upon the stage becomes a potent humanising influence, an Ideal\r\nwhich all may look upon for a shilling.\r\n\r\nI always liked and admired these men, and although I could not help\r\ndeeply regretting their certain ultimate perdition (for they had no sense\r\nof a hereafter, and their only religion was that of self-respect and\r\nconsideration for other people), I never dared to take so great a liberty\r\nwith them as to attempt to put them in possession of my own religious\r\nconvictions, in spite of my knowing that they were the only ones which\r\ncould make them really good and happy, either here or hereafter.  I did\r\ntry sometimes, being impelled to do so by a strong sense of duty, and by\r\nmy deep regret that so much that was admirable should be doomed to ages\r\nif not eternity of torture; but the words stuck in my throat as soon as I\r\nbegan.\r\n\r\nWhether a professional missionary might have a better chance I know not;\r\nsuch persons must doubtless know more about the science of conversion:\r\nfor myself, I could only be thankful that I was in the right path, and\r\nwas obliged to let others take their chance as yet.  If the plan fails by\r\nwhich I propose to convert them myself, I would gladly contribute my mite\r\ntowards the sending two or three trained missionaries, who have been\r\nknown as successful converters of Jews and Mahometans; but such have\r\nseldom much to glory in the flesh, and when I think of the high\r\nYdgrunites, and of the figure which a missionary would probably cut among\r\nthem, I cannot feel sanguine that much good would be arrived at.  Still\r\nthe attempt is worth making, and the worst danger to the missionaries\r\nthemselves would be that of being sent to the hospital where Chowbok\r\nwould have been sent had he come with me into Erewhon.\r\n\r\nTaking then their religious opinions as a whole, I must own that the\r\nErewhonians are superstitious, on account of the views which they hold of\r\ntheir professed gods, and their entirely anomalous and inexplicable\r\nworship of Ydgrun, a worship at once the most powerful, yet most devoid\r\nof formalism, that I ever met with; but in practice things worked better\r\nthan might have been expected, and the conflicting claims of Ydgrun and\r\nthe gods were arranged by unwritten compromises (for the most part in\r\nYdgrun\'s favour), which in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred were very\r\nwell understood.\r\n\r\nI could not conceive why they should not openly acknowledge high\r\nYdgrunism, and discard the objective personality of hope, justice, &c.;\r\nbut whenever I so much as hinted at this, I found that I was on dangerous\r\nground.  They would never have it; returning constantly to the assertion\r\nthat ages ago the divinities were frequently seen, and that the moment\r\ntheir personality was disbelieved in, men would leave off practising even\r\nthose ordinary virtues which the common experience of mankind has agreed\r\non as being the greatest secret of happiness.  "Who ever heard," they\r\nasked, indignantly, "of such things as kindly training, a good example,\r\nand an enlightened regard to one\'s own welfare, being able to keep men\r\nstraight?"  In my hurry, forgetting things which I ought to have\r\nremembered, I answered that if a person could not be kept straight by\r\nthese things, there was nothing that could straighten him, and that if he\r\nwere not ruled by the love and fear of men whom he had seen, neither\r\nwould he be so by that of the gods whom he had not seen.\r\n\r\nAt one time indeed I came upon a small but growing sect who believed,\r\nafter a fashion, in the immortality of the soul and the resurrection from\r\nthe dead; they taught that those who had been born with feeble and\r\ndiseased bodies and had passed their lives in ailing, would be tortured\r\neternally hereafter; but that those who had been born strong and healthy\r\nand handsome would be rewarded for ever and ever.  Of moral qualities or\r\nconduct they made no mention.\r\n\r\nBad as this was, it was a step in advance, inasmuch as they did hold out\r\na future state of some sort, and I was shocked to find that for the most\r\npart they met with opposition, on the score that their doctrine was based\r\nupon no sort of foundation, also that it was immoral in its tendency, and\r\nnot to be desired by any reasonable beings.\r\n\r\nWhen I asked how it could be immoral, I was answered, that if firmly\r\nheld, it would lead people to cheapen this present life, making it appear\r\nto be an affair of only secondary importance; that it would thus distract\r\nmen\'s minds from the perfecting of this world\'s economy, and was an\r\nimpatient cutting, so to speak, of the Gordian knot of life\'s problems,\r\nwhereby some people might gain present satisfaction to themselves at the\r\ncost of infinite damage to others; that the doctrine tended to encourage\r\nthe poor in their improvidence, and in a debasing acquiescence in ills\r\nwhich they might well remedy; that the rewards were illusory and the\r\nresult, after all, of luck, whose empire should be bounded by the grave;\r\nthat its terrors were enervating and unjust; and that even the most\r\nblessed rising would be but the disturbing of a still more blessed\r\nslumber.\r\n\r\nTo all which I could only say that the thing had been actually known to\r\nhappen, and that there were several well-authenticated instances of\r\npeople having died and come to life again--instances which no man in his\r\nsenses could doubt.\r\n\r\n"If this be so," said my opponent, "we must bear it as best we may."\r\n\r\nI then translated for him, as well as I could, the noble speech of Hamlet\r\nin which he says that it is the fear lest worse evils may befall us after\r\ndeath which alone prevents us from rushing into death\'s arms.\r\n\r\n"Nonsense," he answered, "no man was ever yet stopped from cutting his\r\nthroat by any such fears as your poet ascribes to him--and your poet\r\nprobably knew this perfectly well.  If a man cuts his throat he is at\r\nbay, and thinks of nothing but escape, no matter whither, provided he can\r\nshuffle off his present.  No.  Men are kept at their posts, not by the\r\nfear that if they quit them they may quit a frying-pan for a fire, but by\r\nthe hope that if they hold on, the fire may burn less fiercely.  \'The\r\nrespect,\' to quote your poet, \'that makes calamity of so long a life,\' is\r\nthe consideration that though calamity may live long, the sufferer may\r\nlive longer still."\r\n\r\nOn this, seeing that there was little probability of our coming to an\r\nagreement, I let the argument drop, and my opponent presently left me\r\nwith as much disapprobation as he could show without being overtly rude.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII: BIRTH FORMULAE\r\n\r\n\r\nI heard what follows not from Arowhena, but from Mr. Nosnibor and some of\r\nthe gentlemen who occasionally dined at the house: they told me that the\r\nErewhonians believe in pre-existence; and not only this (of which I will\r\nwrite more fully in the next chapter), but they believe that it is of\r\ntheir own free act and deed in a previous state that they come to be born\r\ninto this world at all.  They hold that the unborn are perpetually\r\nplaguing and tormenting the married of both sexes, fluttering about them\r\nincessantly, and giving them no peace either of mind or body until they\r\nhave consented to take them under their protection.  If this were not so\r\n(this at least is what they urge), it would be a monstrous freedom for\r\none man to take with another, to say that he should undergo the chances\r\nand changes of this mortal life without any option in the matter.  No man\r\nwould have any right to get married at all, inasmuch as he can never tell\r\nwhat frightful misery his doing so may entail forcibly upon a being who\r\ncannot be unhappy as long as he does not exist.  They feel this so\r\nstrongly that they are resolved to shift the blame on to other shoulders;\r\nand have fashioned a long mythology as to the world in which the unborn\r\npeople live, and what they do, and the arts and machinations to which\r\nthey have recourse in order to get themselves into our own world.  But of\r\nthis more anon: what I would relate here is their manner of dealing with\r\nthose who do come.\r\n\r\nIt is a distinguishing peculiarity of the Erewhonians that when they\r\nprofess themselves to be quite certain about any matter, and avow it as a\r\nbase on which they are to build a system of practice, they seldom quite\r\nbelieve in it.  If they smell a rat about the precincts of a cherished\r\ninstitution, they will always stop their noses to it if they can.\r\n\r\nThis is what most of them did in this matter of the unborn, for I cannot\r\n(and never could) think that they seriously believed in their mythology\r\nconcerning pre-existence: they did and they did not; they did not know\r\nthemselves what they believed; all they did know was that it was a\r\ndisease not to believe as they did.  The only thing of which they were\r\nquite sure was that it was the pestering of the unborn which caused them\r\nto be brought into this world, and that they would not have been here if\r\nthey would have only let peaceable people alone.\r\n\r\nIt would be hard to disprove this position, and they might have a good\r\ncase if they would only leave it as it stands.  But this they will not\r\ndo; they must have assurance doubly sure; they must have the written word\r\nof the child itself as soon as it is born, giving the parents indemnity\r\nfrom all responsibility on the score of its birth, and asserting its own\r\npre-existence.  They have therefore devised something which they call a\r\nbirth formula--a document which varies in words according to the caution\r\nof parents, but is much the same practically in all cases; for it has\r\nbeen the business of the Erewhonian lawyers during many ages to exercise\r\ntheir skill in perfecting it and providing for every contingency.\r\n\r\nThese formulae are printed on common paper at a moderate cost for the\r\npoor; but the rich have them written on parchment and handsomely bound,\r\nso that the getting up of a person\'s birth formula is a test of his\r\nsocial position.  They commence by setting forth, That whereas A. B. was\r\na member of the kingdom of the unborn, where he was well provided for in\r\nevery way, and had no cause of discontent, &c., &c., he did of his own\r\nwanton depravity and restlessness conceive a desire to enter into this\r\npresent world; that thereon having taken the necessary steps as set forth\r\nin laws of the unborn kingdom, he did with malice aforethought set\r\nhimself to plague and pester two unfortunate people who had never wronged\r\nhim, and who were quite contented and happy until he conceived this base\r\ndesign against their peace; for which wrong he now humbly entreats their\r\npardon.\r\n\r\nHe acknowledges that he is responsible for all physical blemishes and\r\ndeficiencies which may render him answerable to the laws of his country;\r\nthat his parents have nothing whatever to do with any of these things;\r\nand that they have a right to kill him at once if they be so minded,\r\nthough he entreats them to show their marvellous goodness and clemency by\r\nsparing his life.  If they will do this, he promises to be their most\r\nobedient and abject creature during his earlier years, and indeed all his\r\nlife, unless they should see fit in their abundant generosity to remit\r\nsome portion of his service hereafter.  And so the formula continues,\r\ngoing sometimes into very minute details, according to the fancies of\r\nfamily lawyers, who will not make it any shorter than they can help.\r\n\r\nThe deed being thus prepared, on the third or fourth day after the birth\r\nof the child, or as they call it, the "final importunity," the friends\r\ngather together, and there is a feast held, where they are all very\r\nmelancholy--as a general rule, I believe, quite truly so--and make\r\npresents to the father and mother of the child in order to console them\r\nfor the injury which has just been done them by the unborn.\r\n\r\nBy-and-by the child himself is brought down by his nurse, and the company\r\nbegin to rail upon him, upbraiding him for his impertinence, and asking\r\nhim what amends he proposes to make for the wrong that he has committed,\r\nand how he can look for care and nourishment from those who have perhaps\r\nalready been injured by the unborn on some ten or twelve occasions; for\r\nthey say of people with large families, that they have suffered terrible\r\ninjuries from the unborn; till at last, when this has been carried far\r\nenough, some one suggests the formula, which is brought out and solemnly\r\nread to the child by the family straightener.  This gentleman is always\r\ninvited on these occasions, for the very fact of intrusion into a\r\npeaceful family shows a depravity on the part of the child which requires\r\nhis professional services.\r\n\r\nOn being teased by the reading and tweaked by the nurse, the child will\r\ncommonly begin to cry, which is reckoned a good sign, as showing a\r\nconsciousness of guilt.  He is thereon asked, Does he assent to the\r\nformula? on which, as he still continues crying and can obviously make no\r\nanswer, some one of the friends comes forward and undertakes to sign the\r\ndocument on his behalf, feeling sure (so he says) that the child would do\r\nit if he only knew how, and that he will release the present signer from\r\nhis engagement on arriving at maturity.  The friend then inscribes the\r\nsignature of the child at the foot of the parchment, which is held to\r\nbind the child as much as though he had signed it himself.\r\n\r\nEven this, however, does not fully content them, for they feel a little\r\nuneasy until they have got the child\'s own signature after all.  So when\r\nhe is about fourteen, these good people partly bribe him by promises of\r\ngreater liberty and good things, and partly intimidate him through their\r\ngreat power of making themselves actively unpleasant to him, so that\r\nthough there is a show of freedom made, there is really none; they also\r\nuse the offices of the teachers in the Colleges of Unreason, till at\r\nlast, in one way or another, they take very good care that he shall sign\r\nthe paper by which he professes to have been a free agent in coming into\r\nthe world, and to take all the responsibility of having done so on to his\r\nown shoulders.  And yet, though this document is obviously the most\r\nimportant which any one can sign in his whole life, they will have him do\r\nso at an age when neither they nor the law will for many a year allow any\r\none else to bind him to the smallest obligation, no matter how\r\nrighteously he may owe it, because they hold him too young to know what\r\nhe is about, and do not consider it fair that he should commit himself to\r\nanything that may prejudice him in after years.\r\n\r\nI own that all this seemed rather hard, and not of a piece with the many\r\nadmirable institutions existing among them.  I once ventured to say a\r\npart of what I thought about it to one of the Professors of Unreason.  I\r\ndid it very tenderly, but his justification of the system was quite out\r\nof my comprehension.  I remember asking him whether he did not think it\r\nwould do harm to a lad\'s principles, by weakening his sense of the\r\nsanctity of his word and of truth generally, that he should be led into\r\nentering upon a solemn declaration as to the truth of things about which\r\nall that he can certainly know is that he knows nothing--whether, in\r\nfact, the teachers who so led him, or who taught anything as a certainty\r\nof which they were themselves uncertain, were not earning their living by\r\nimpairing the truth-sense of their pupils (a delicate organisation\r\nmostly), and by vitiating one of their most sacred instincts.\r\n\r\nThe Professor, who was a delightful person, seemed greatly surprised at\r\nthe view which I took, but it had no influence with him whatsoever.  No\r\none, he answered, expected that the boy either would or could know all\r\nthat he said he knew; but the world was full of compromises; and there\r\nwas hardly any affirmation which would bear being interpreted literally.\r\nHuman language was too gross a vehicle of thought--thought being\r\nincapable of absolute translation.  He added, that as there can be no\r\ntranslation from one language into another which shall not scant the\r\nmeaning somewhat, or enlarge upon it, so there is no language which can\r\nrender thought without a jarring and a harshness somewhere--and so forth;\r\nall of which seemed to come to this in the end, that it was the custom of\r\nthe country, and that the Erewhonians were a conservative people; that\r\nthe boy would have to begin compromising sooner or later, and this was\r\npart of his education in the art.  It was perhaps to be regretted that\r\ncompromise should be as necessary as it was; still it was necessary, and\r\nthe sooner the boy got to understand it the better for himself.  But they\r\nnever tell this to the boy.\r\n\r\nFrom the book of their mythology about the unborn I made the extracts\r\nwhich will form the following chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX: THE WORLD OF THE UNBORN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Erewhonians say that we are drawn through life backwards; or again,\r\nthat we go onwards into the future as into a dark corridor.  Time walks\r\nbeside us and flings back shutters as we advance; but the light thus\r\ngiven often dazzles us, and deepens the darkness which is in front.  We\r\ncan see but little at a time, and heed that little far less than our\r\napprehension of what we shall see next; ever peering curiously through\r\nthe glare of the present into the gloom of the future, we presage the\r\nleading lines of that which is before us, by faintly reflected lights\r\nfrom dull mirrors that are behind, and stumble on as we may till the trap-\r\ndoor opens beneath us and we are gone.\r\n\r\nThey say at other times that the future and the past are as a panorama\r\nupon two rollers; that which is on the roller of the future unwraps\r\nitself on to the roller of the past; we cannot hasten it, and we may not\r\nstay it; we must see all that is unfolded to us whether it be good or\r\nill; and what we have seen once we may see again no more.  It is ever\r\nunwinding and being wound; we catch it in transition for a moment, and\r\ncall it present; our flustered senses gather what impression they can,\r\nand we guess at what is coming by the tenor of that which we have seen.\r\nThe same hand has painted the whole picture, and the incidents vary\r\nlittle--rivers, woods, plains, mountains, towns and peoples, love,\r\nsorrow, and death: yet the interest never flags, and we look hopefully\r\nfor some good fortune, or fearfully lest our own faces be shown us as\r\nfiguring in something terrible.  When the scene is past we think we know\r\nit, though there is so much to see, and so little time to see it, that\r\nour conceit of knowledge as regards the past is for the most part poorly\r\nfounded; neither do we care about it greatly, save in so far as it may\r\naffect the future, wherein our interest mainly lies.\r\n\r\nThe Erewhonians say it was by chance only that the earth and stars and\r\nall the heavenly worlds began to roll from east to west, and not from\r\nwest to east, and in like manner they say it is by chance that man is\r\ndrawn through life with his face to the past instead of to the future.\r\nFor the future is there as much as the past, only that we may not see it.\r\nIs it not in the loins of the past, and must not the past alter before\r\nthe future can do so?\r\n\r\nSometimes, again, they say that there was a race of men tried upon the\r\nearth once, who knew the future better than the past, but that they died\r\nin a twelvemonth from the misery which their knowledge caused them; and\r\nif any were to be born too prescient now, he would be culled out by\r\nnatural selection, before he had time to transmit so peace-destroying a\r\nfaculty to his descendants.\r\n\r\nStrange fate for man!  He must perish if he get that, which he must\r\nperish if he strive not after.  If he strive not after it he is no better\r\nthan the brutes, if he get it he is more miserable than the devils.\r\n\r\nHaving waded through many chapters like the above, I came at last to the\r\nunborn themselves, and found that they were held to be souls pure and\r\nsimple, having no actual bodies, but living in a sort of gaseous yet more\r\nor less anthropomorphic existence, like that of a ghost; they have thus\r\nneither flesh nor blood nor warmth.  Nevertheless they are supposed to\r\nhave local habitations and cities wherein they dwell, though these are as\r\nunsubstantial as their inhabitants; they are even thought to eat and\r\ndrink some thin ambrosial sustenance, and generally to be capable of\r\ndoing whatever mankind can do, only after a visionary ghostly fashion as\r\nin a dream.  On the other hand, as long as they remain where they are\r\nthey never die--the only form of death in the unborn world being the\r\nleaving it for our own.  They are believed to be extremely numerous, far\r\nmore so than mankind.  They arrive from unknown planets, full grown, in\r\nlarge batches at a time; but they can only leave the unborn world by\r\ntaking the steps necessary for their arrival here--which is, in fact, by\r\nsuicide.\r\n\r\nThey ought to be an exceedingly happy people, for they have no extremes\r\nof good or ill fortune; never marrying, but living in a state much like\r\nthat fabled by the poets as the primitive condition of mankind.  In spite\r\nof this, however, they are incessantly complaining; they know that we in\r\nthis world have bodies, and indeed they know everything else about us,\r\nfor they move among us whithersoever they will, and can read our\r\nthoughts, as well as survey our actions at pleasure.  One would think\r\nthat this should be enough for them; and most of them are indeed alive to\r\nthe desperate risk which they will run by indulging themselves in that\r\nbody with "sensible warm motion" which they so much desire; nevertheless,\r\nthere are some to whom the _ennui_ of a disembodied existence is so\r\nintolerable that they will venture anything for a change; so they resolve\r\nto quit.  The conditions which they must accept are so uncertain, that\r\nnone but the most foolish of the unborn will consent to them; and it is\r\nfrom these, and these only, that our own ranks are recruited.\r\n\r\nWhen they have finally made up their minds to leave, they must go before\r\nthe magistrate of the nearest town, and sign an affidavit of their desire\r\nto quit their then existence.  On their having done this, the magistrate\r\nreads them the conditions which they must accept, and which are so long\r\nthat I can only extract some of the principal points, which are mainly\r\nthe following:-\r\n\r\nFirst, they must take a potion which will destroy their memory and sense\r\nof identity; they must go into the world helpless, and without a will of\r\ntheir own; they must draw lots for their dispositions before they go, and\r\ntake them, such as they are, for better or worse--neither are they to be\r\nallowed any choice in the matter of the body which they so much desire;\r\nthey are simply allotted by chance, and without appeal, to two people\r\nwhom it is their business to find and pester until they adopt them.  Who\r\nthese are to be, whether rich or poor, kind or unkind, healthy or\r\ndiseased, there is no knowing; they have, in fact, to entrust themselves\r\nfor many years to the care of those for whose good constitution and good\r\nsense they have no sort of guarantee.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to read the lectures which the wiser heads give to those\r\nwho are meditating a change.  They talk with them as we talk with a\r\nspendthrift, and with about as much success.\r\n\r\n"To be born," they say, "is a felony--it is a capital crime, for which\r\nsentence may be executed at any moment after the commission of the\r\noffence.  You may perhaps happen to live for some seventy or eighty\r\nyears, but what is that, compared with the eternity you now enjoy?  And\r\neven though the sentence were commuted, and you were allowed to live on\r\nfor ever, you would in time become so terribly weary of life that\r\nexecution would be the greatest mercy to you.\r\n\r\n"Consider the infinite risk; to be born of wicked parents and trained in\r\nvice! to be born of silly parents, and trained to unrealities! of parents\r\nwho regard you as a sort of chattel or property, belonging more to them\r\nthan to yourself!  Again, you may draw utterly unsympathetic parents, who\r\nwill never be able to understand you, and who will do their best to\r\nthwart you (as a hen when she has hatched a duckling), and then call you\r\nungrateful because you do not love them; or, again, you may draw parents\r\nwho look upon you as a thing to be cowed while it is still young, lest it\r\nshould give them trouble hereafter by having wishes and feelings of its\r\nown.\r\n\r\n"In later life, when you have been finally allowed to pass muster as a\r\nfull member of the world, you will yourself become liable to the\r\npesterings of the unborn--and a very happy life you may be led in\r\nconsequence!  For we solicit so strongly that a few only--nor these the\r\nbest--can refuse us; and yet not to refuse is much the same as going into\r\npartnership with half-a-dozen different people about whom one can know\r\nabsolutely nothing beforehand--not even whether one is going into\r\npartnership with men or women, nor with how many of either.  Delude not\r\nyourself with thinking that you will be wiser than your parents.  You may\r\nbe an age in advance of those whom you have pestered, but unless you are\r\none of the great ones you will still be an age behind those who will in\r\ntheir turn pester you.\r\n\r\n"Imagine what it must be to have an unborn quartered upon you, who is of\r\nan entirely different temperament and disposition to your own; nay, half-\r\na-dozen such, who will not love you though you have stinted yourself in a\r\nthousand ways to provide for their comfort and well-being,--who will\r\nforget all your self-sacrifice, and of whom you may never be sure that\r\nthey are not bearing a grudge against you for errors of judgement into\r\nwhich you may have fallen, though you had hoped that such had been long\r\nsince atoned for.  Ingratitude such as this is not uncommon, yet fancy\r\nwhat it must be to bear!  It is hard upon the duckling to have been\r\nhatched by a hen, but is it not also hard upon the hen to have hatched\r\nthe duckling?\r\n\r\n"Consider it again, we pray you, not for our sake but for your own.  Your\r\ninitial character you must draw by lot; but whatever it is, it can only\r\ncome to a tolerably successful development after long training; remember\r\nthat over that training you will have no control.  It is possible, and\r\neven probable, that whatever you may get in after life which is of real\r\npleasure and service to you, will have to be won in spite of, rather than\r\nby the help of, those whom you are now about to pester, and that you will\r\nonly win your freedom after years of a painful struggle in which it will\r\nbe hard to say whether you have suffered most injury, or inflicted it.\r\n\r\n"Remember also, that if you go into the world you will have free will;\r\nthat you will be obliged to have it; that there is no escaping it; that\r\nyou will be fettered to it during your whole life, and must on every\r\noccasion do that which on the whole seems best to you at any given time,\r\nno matter whether you are right or wrong in choosing it.  Your mind will\r\nbe a balance for considerations, and your action will go with the heavier\r\nscale.  How it shall fall will depend upon the kind of scales which you\r\nmay have drawn at birth, the bias which they will have obtained by use,\r\nand the weight of the immediate considerations.  If the scales were good\r\nto start with, and if they have not been outrageously tampered with in\r\nchildhood, and if the combinations into which you enter are average ones,\r\nyou may come off well; but there are too many \'ifs\' in this, and with the\r\nfailure of any one of them your misery is assured.  Reflect on this, and\r\nremember that should the ill come upon you, you will have yourself to\r\nthank, for it is your own choice to be born, and there is no compulsion\r\nin the matter.\r\n\r\n"Not that we deny the existence of pleasures among mankind; there is a\r\ncertain show of sundry phases of contentment which may even amount to\r\nvery considerable happiness; but mark how they are distributed over a\r\nman\'s life, belonging, all the keenest of them, to the fore part, and few\r\nindeed to the after.  Can there be any pleasure worth purchasing with the\r\nmiseries of a decrepit age?  If you are good, strong, and handsome, you\r\nhave a fine fortune indeed at twenty, but how much of it will be left at\r\nsixty?  For you must live on your capital; there is no investing your\r\npowers so that you may get a small annuity of life for ever: you must eat\r\nup your principal bit by bit, and be tortured by seeing it grow\r\ncontinually smaller and smaller, even though you happen to escape being\r\nrudely robbed of it by crime or casualty.\r\n\r\n"Remember, too, that there never yet was a man of forty who would not\r\ncome back into the world of the unborn if he could do so with decency and\r\nhonour.  Being in the world he will as a general rule stay till he is\r\nforced to go; but do you think that he would consent to be born again,\r\nand re-live his life, if he had the offer of doing so?  Do not think it.\r\nIf he could so alter the past as that he should never have come into\r\nbeing at all, do you not think that he would do it very gladly?\r\n\r\n"What was it that one of their own poets meant, if it was not this, when\r\nhe cried out upon the day in which he was born, and the night in which it\r\nwas said there is a man child conceived?  \'For now,\' he says, \'I should\r\nhave lain still and been quiet, I should have slept; then had I been at\r\nrest with kings and counsellors of the earth, which built desolate places\r\nfor themselves; or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses\r\nwith silver; or as an hidden untimely birth, I had not been; as infants\r\nwhich never saw light.  There the wicked cease from troubling, and the\r\nweary are at rest.\'  Be very sure that the guilt of being born carries\r\nthis punishment at times to all men; but how can they ask for pity, or\r\ncomplain of any mischief that may befall them, having entered open-eyed\r\ninto the snare?\r\n\r\n"One word more and we have done.  If any faint remembrance, as of a\r\ndream, flit in some puzzled moment across your brain, and you shall feel\r\nthat the potion which is to be given you shall not have done its work,\r\nand the memory of this existence which you are leaving endeavours vainly\r\nto return; we say in such a moment, when you clutch at the dream but it\r\neludes your grasp, and you watch it, as Orpheus watched Eurydice, gliding\r\nback again into the twilight kingdom, fly--fly--if you can remember the\r\nadvice--to the haven of your present and immediate duty, taking shelter\r\nincessantly in the work which you have in hand.  This much you may\r\nperhaps recall; and this, if you will imprint it deeply upon your every\r\nfaculty, will be most likely to bring you safely and honourably home\r\nthrough the trials that are before you." {3}\r\n\r\nThis is the fashion in which they reason with those who would be for\r\nleaving them, but it is seldom that they do much good, for none but the\r\nunquiet and unreasonable ever think of being born, and those who are\r\nfoolish enough to think of it are generally foolish enough to do it.\r\nFinding, therefore, that they can do no more, the friends follow weeping\r\nto the courthouse of the chief magistrate, where the one who wishes to be\r\nborn declares solemnly and openly that he accepts the conditions attached\r\nto his decision.  On this he is presented with a potion, which\r\nimmediately destroys his memory and sense of identity, and dissipates the\r\nthin gaseous tenement which he has inhabited: he becomes a bare vital\r\nprinciple, not to be perceived by human senses, nor to be by any chemical\r\ntest appreciated.  He has but one instinct, which is that he is to go to\r\nsuch and such a place, where he will find two persons whom he is to\r\nimportune till they consent to undertake him; but whether he is to find\r\nthese persons among the race of Chowbok or the Erewhonians themselves is\r\nnot for him to choose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX: WHAT THEY MEAN BY IT\r\n\r\n\r\nI have given the above mythology at some length, but it is only a small\r\npart of what they have upon the subject.  My first feeling on reading it\r\nwas that any amount of folly on the part of the unborn in coming here was\r\njustified by a desire to escape from such intolerable prosing.  The\r\nmythology is obviously an unfair and exaggerated representation of life\r\nand things; and had its authors been so minded they could have easily\r\ndrawn a picture which would err as much on the bright side as this does\r\non the dark.  No Erewhonian believes that the world is as black as it has\r\nbeen here painted, but it is one of their peculiarities that they very\r\noften do not believe or mean things which they profess to regard as\r\nindisputable.\r\n\r\nIn the present instance their professed views concerning the unborn have\r\narisen from their desire to prove that people have been presented with\r\nthe gloomiest possible picture of their own prospects before they came\r\nhere; otherwise, they could hardly say to one whom they are going to\r\npunish for an affection of the heart or brain that it is all his own\r\ndoing.  In practice they modify their theory to a considerable extent,\r\nand seldom refer to the birth formula except in extreme cases; for the\r\nforce of habit, or what not, gives many of them a kindly interest even in\r\ncreatures who have so much wronged them as the unborn have done; and\r\nthough a man generally hates the unwelcome little stranger for the first\r\ntwelve months, he is apt to mollify (according to his lights) as time\r\ngoes on, and sometimes he will become inordinately attached to the beings\r\nwhom he is pleased to call his children.\r\n\r\nOf course, according to Erewhonian premises, it would serve people right\r\nto be punished and scouted for moral and intellectual diseases as much as\r\nfor physical, and I cannot to this day understand why they should have\r\nstopped short half way.  Neither, again, can I understand why their\r\nhaving done so should have been, as it certainly was, a matter of so much\r\nconcern to myself.  What could it matter to me how many absurdities the\r\nErewhonians might adopt?  Nevertheless I longed to make them think as I\r\ndid, for the wish to spread those opinions that we hold conducive to our\r\nown welfare is so deeply rooted in the English character that few of us\r\ncan escape its influence.  But let this pass.\r\n\r\nIn spite of not a few modifications in practice of a theory which is\r\nitself revolting, the relations between children and parents in that\r\ncountry are less happy than in Europe.  It was rarely that I saw cases of\r\nreal hearty and intense affection between the old people and the young\r\nones.  Here and there I did so, and was quite sure that the children,\r\neven at the age of twenty, were fonder of their parents than they were of\r\nany one else; and that of their own inclination, being free to choose\r\nwhat company they would, they would often choose that of their father and\r\nmother.  The straightener\'s carriage was rarely seen at the door of those\r\nhouses.  I saw two or three such cases during the time that I remained in\r\nthe country, and cannot express the pleasure which I derived from a sight\r\nsuggestive of so much goodness and wisdom and forbearance, so richly\r\nrewarded; yet I firmly believe that the same thing would happen in nine\r\nfamilies out of ten if the parents were merely to remember how they felt\r\nwhen they were young, and actually to behave towards their children as\r\nthey would have had their own parents behave towards themselves.  But\r\nthis, which would appear to be so simple and obvious, seems also to be a\r\nthing which not one in a hundred thousand is able to put in practice.  It\r\nis only the very great and good who have any living faith in the simplest\r\naxioms; and there are few who are so holy as to feel that 19 and 13 make\r\n32 as certainly as 2 and 2 make 4.\r\n\r\nI am quite sure that if this narrative should ever fall into Erewhonian\r\nhands, it will be said that what I have written about the relations\r\nbetween parents and children being seldom satisfactory is an infamous\r\nperversion of facts, and that in truth there are few young people who do\r\nnot feel happier in the society of their nearest relations {4} than in\r\nany other.  Mr. Nosnibor would be sure to say this.  Yet I cannot refrain\r\nfrom expressing an opinion that he would be a good deal embarrassed if\r\nhis deceased parents were to reappear and propose to pay him a six\r\nmonths\' visit.  I doubt whether there are many things which he would\r\nregard as a greater infliction.  They had died at a ripe old age some\r\ntwenty years before I came to know him, so the case is an extreme one;\r\nbut surely if they had treated him with what in his youth he had felt to\r\nbe true unselfishness, his face would brighten when he thought of them to\r\nthe end of his life.\r\n\r\nIn the one or two cases of true family affection which I met with, I am\r\nsure that the young people who were so genuinely fond of their fathers\r\nand mothers at eighteen, would at sixty be perfectly delighted were they\r\nto get the chance of welcoming them as their guests.  There is nothing\r\nwhich could please them better, except perhaps to watch the happiness of\r\ntheir own children and grandchildren.\r\n\r\nThis is how things should be.  It is not an impossible ideal; it is one\r\nwhich actually does exist in some few cases, and might exist in almost\r\nall, with a little more patience and forbearance upon the parents\' part;\r\nbut it is rare at present--so rare that they have a proverb which I can\r\nonly translate in a very roundabout way, but which says that the great\r\nhappiness of some people in a future state will consist in watching the\r\ndistress of their parents on returning to eternal companionship with\r\ntheir grandfathers and grandmothers; whilst "compulsory affection" is the\r\nidea which lies at the root of their word for the deepest anguish.\r\n\r\nThere is no talisman in the word "parent" which can generate miracles of\r\naffection, and I can well believe that my own child might find it less of\r\na calamity to lose both Arowhena and myself when he is six years old,\r\nthan to find us again when he is sixty--a sentence which I would not pen\r\ndid I not feel that by doing so I was giving him something like a\r\nhostage, or at any rate putting a weapon into his hands against me,\r\nshould my selfishness exceed reasonable limits.\r\n\r\nMoney is at the bottom of all this to a great extent.  If the parents\r\nwould put their children in the way of earning a competence earlier than\r\nthey do, the children would soon become self-supporting and independent.\r\nAs it is, under the present system, the young ones get old enough to have\r\nall manner of legitimate wants (that is, if they have any "go" about\r\nthem) before they have learnt the means of earning money to pay for them;\r\nhence they must either do without them, or take more money than the\r\nparents can be expected to spare.  This is due chiefly to the schools of\r\nUnreason, where a boy is taught upon hypothetical principles, as I will\r\nexplain hereafter; spending years in being incapacitated for doing this,\r\nthat, or the other (he hardly knows what), during all which time he ought\r\nto have been actually doing the thing itself, beginning at the lowest\r\ngrades, picking it up through actual practice, and rising according to\r\nthe energy which is in him.\r\n\r\nThese schools of Unreason surprised me much.  It would be easy to fall\r\ninto pseudo-utilitarianism, and I would fain believe that the system may\r\nbe good for the children of very rich parents, or for those who show a\r\nnatural instinct to acquire hypothetical lore; but the misery was that\r\ntheir Ydgrun-worship required all people with any pretence to\r\nrespectability to send their children to some one or other of these\r\nschools, mulcting them of years of money.  It astonished me to see what\r\nsacrifices the parents would make in order to render their children as\r\nnearly useless as possible; and it was hard to say whether the old\r\nsuffered most from the expense which they were thus put to, or the young\r\nfrom being deliberately swindled in some of the most important branches\r\nof human inquiry, and directed into false channels or left to drift in\r\nthe great majority of cases.\r\n\r\nI cannot think I am mistaken in believing that the growing tendency to\r\nlimit families by infanticide--an evil which was causing general alarm\r\nthroughout the country--was almost entirely due to the way in which\r\neducation had become a fetish from one end of Erewhon to the other.\r\nGranted that provision should be made whereby every child should be\r\ntaught reading, writing, and arithmetic, but here compulsory state-aided\r\neducation should end, and the child should begin (with all due\r\nprecautions to ensure that he is not overworked) to acquire the rudiments\r\nof that art whereby he is to earn his living.\r\n\r\nHe cannot acquire these in what we in England call schools of technical\r\neducation; such schools are cloister life as against the rough and tumble\r\nof the world; they unfit, rather than fit for work in the open.  An art\r\ncan only be learned in the workshop of those who are winning their bread\r\nby it.\r\n\r\nBoys, as a rule, hate the artificial, and delight in the actual; give\r\nthem the chance of earning, and they will soon earn.  When parents find\r\nthat their children, instead of being made artificially burdensome, will\r\nearly begin to contribute to the well-being of the family, they will soon\r\nleave off killing them, and will seek to have that plenitude of offspring\r\nwhich they now avoid.  As things are, the state lays greater burdens on\r\nparents than flesh and blood can bear, and then wrings its hands over an\r\nevil for which it is itself mainly responsible.\r\n\r\nWith the less well-dressed classes the harm was not so great; for among\r\nthese, at about ten years old, the child has to begin doing something: if\r\nhe is capable he makes his way up; if he is not, he is at any rate not\r\nmade more incapable by what his friends are pleased to call his\r\neducation.  People find their level as a rule; and though they\r\nunfortunately sometimes miss it, it is in the main true that those who\r\nhave valuable qualities are perceived to have them and can sell them.  I\r\nthink that the Erewhonians are beginning to become aware of these things,\r\nfor there was much talk about putting a tax upon all parents whose\r\nchildren were not earning a competence according to their degrees by the\r\ntime they were twenty years old.  I am sure that if they will have the\r\ncourage to carry it through they will never regret it; for the parents\r\nwill take care that the children shall begin earning money (which means\r\n"doing good" to society) at an early age; then the children will be\r\nindependent early, and they will not press on the parents, nor the\r\nparents on them, and they will like each other better than they do now.\r\n\r\nThis is the true philanthropy.  He who makes a colossal fortune in the\r\nhosiery trade, and by his energy has succeeded in reducing the price of\r\nwoollen goods by the thousandth part of a penny in the pound--this man is\r\nworth ten professional philanthropists.  So strongly are the Erewhonians\r\nimpressed with this, that if a man has made a fortune of over 20,000\r\npounds a year they exempt him from all taxation, considering him as a\r\nwork of art, and too precious to be meddled with; they say, "How very\r\nmuch he must have done for society before society could have been\r\nprevailed upon to give him so much money;" so magnificent an organisation\r\noverawes them; they regard it as a thing dropped from heaven.\r\n\r\n"Money," they say, "is the symbol of duty, it is the sacrament of having\r\ndone for mankind that which mankind wanted.  Mankind may not be a very\r\ngood judge, but there is no better."  This used to shock me at first,\r\nwhen I remembered that it had been said on high authority that they who\r\nhave riches shall enter hardly into the kingdom of heaven; but the\r\ninfluence of Erewhon had made me begin to see things in a new light, and\r\nI could not help thinking that they who have not riches shall enter more\r\nhardly still.\r\n\r\nPeople oppose money to culture, and imply that if a man has spent his\r\ntime in making money he will not be cultivated--fallacy of fallacies!  As\r\nthough there could be a greater aid to culture than the having earned an\r\nhonourable independence, and as though any amount of culture will do much\r\nfor the man who is penniless, except make him feel his position more\r\ndeeply.  The young man who was told to sell all his goods and give to the\r\npoor, must have been an entirely exceptional person if the advice was\r\ngiven wisely, either for him or for the poor; how much more often does it\r\nhappen that we perceive a man to have all sorts of good qualities except\r\nmoney, and feel that his real duty lies in getting every half-penny that\r\nhe can persuade others to pay him for his services, and becoming rich.  It\r\nhas been said that the love of money is the root of all evil.  The want\r\nof money is so quite as truly.\r\n\r\nThe above may sound irreverent, but it is conceived in a spirit of the\r\nmost utter reverence for those things which do alone deserve it--that is,\r\nfor the things which are, which mould us and fashion us, be they what\r\nthey may; for the things that have power to punish us, and which will\r\npunish us if we do not heed them; for our masters therefore.  But I am\r\ndrifting away from my story.\r\n\r\nThey have another plan about which they are making a great noise and\r\nfuss, much as some are doing with women\'s rights in England.  A party of\r\nextreme radicals have professed themselves unable to decide upon the\r\nsuperiority of age or youth.  At present all goes on the supposition that\r\nit is desirable to make the young old as soon as possible.  Some would\r\nhave it that this is wrong, and that the object of education should be to\r\nkeep the old young as long as possible.  They say that each age should\r\ntake it turn in turn about, week by week, one week the old to be\r\ntopsawyers, and the other the young, drawing the line at thirty-five\r\nyears of age; but they insist that the young should be allowed to inflict\r\ncorporal chastisement on the old, without which the old would be quite\r\nincorrigible.  In any European country this would be out of the question;\r\nbut it is not so there, for the straighteners are constantly ordering\r\npeople to be flogged, so that they are familiar with the notion.  I do\r\nnot suppose that the idea will be ever acted upon; but its having been\r\neven mooted is enough to show the utter perversion of the Erewhonian\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI: THE COLLEGES OF UNREASON\r\n\r\n\r\nI had now been a visitor with the Nosnibors for some five or six months,\r\nand though I had frequently proposed to leave them and take apartments of\r\nmy own, they would not hear of my doing so.  I suppose they thought I\r\nshould be more likely to fall in love with Zulora if I remained, but it\r\nwas my affection for Arowhena that kept me.\r\n\r\nDuring all this time both Arowhena and myself had been dreaming, and\r\ndrifting towards an avowed attachment, but had not dared to face the real\r\ndifficulties of the position.  Gradually, however, matters came to a\r\ncrisis in spite of ourselves, and we got to see the true state of the\r\ncase, all too clearly.\r\n\r\nOne evening we were sitting in the garden, and I had been trying in every\r\nstupid roundabout way to get her to say that she should be at any rate\r\nsorry for a man, if he really loved a woman who would not marry him.  I\r\nhad been stammering and blushing, and been as silly as any one could be,\r\nand I suppose had pained her by fishing for pity for myself in such a\r\ntransparent way, and saying nothing about her own need of it; at any\r\nrate, she turned all upon me with a sweet sad smile and said, "Sorry?  I\r\nam sorry for myself; I am sorry for you; and I am sorry for every one."\r\nThe words had no sooner crossed her lips than she bowed her head, gave me\r\na look as though I were to make no answer, and left me.\r\n\r\nThe words were few and simple, but the manner with which they were\r\nuttered was ineffable: the scales fell from my eyes, and I felt that I\r\nhad no right to try and induce her to infringe one of the most inviolable\r\ncustoms of her country, as she needs must do if she were to marry me.  I\r\nsat for a long while thinking, and when I remembered the sin and shame\r\nand misery which an unrighteous marriage--for as such it would be held in\r\nErewhon--would entail, I became thoroughly ashamed of myself for having\r\nbeen so long self-blinded.  I write coldly now, but I suffered keenly at\r\nthe time, and should probably retain a much more vivid recollection of\r\nwhat I felt, had not all ended so happily.\r\n\r\nAs for giving up the idea of marrying Arowhena, it never so much as\r\nentered my head to do so: the solution must be found in some other\r\ndirection than this.  The idea of waiting till somebody married Zulora\r\nwas to be no less summarily dismissed.  To marry Arowhena at once in\r\nErewhon--this had already been abandoned: there remained therefore but\r\none alternative, and that was to run away with her, and get her with me\r\nto Europe, where there would be no bar to our union save my own\r\nimpecuniosity, a matter which gave me no uneasiness.\r\n\r\nTo this obvious and simple plan I could see but two objections that\r\ndeserved the name,--the first, that perhaps Arowhena would not come; the\r\nsecond, that it was almost impossible for me to escape even alone, for\r\nthe king had himself told me that I was to consider myself a prisoner on\r\nparole, and that the first sign of my endeavouring to escape would cause\r\nme to be sent to one of the hospitals for incurables.  Besides, I did not\r\nknow the geography of the country, and even were I to try and find my way\r\nback, I should be discovered long before I had reached the pass over\r\nwhich I had come.  How then could I hope to be able to take Arowhena with\r\nme?  For days and days I turned these difficulties over in my mind, and\r\nat last hit upon as wild a plan as was ever suggested by extremity.  This\r\nwas to meet the second difficulty: the first gave me less uneasiness, for\r\nwhen Arowhena and I next met after our interview in the garden I could\r\nsee that she had suffered not less acutely than myself.\r\n\r\nI resolved that I would have another interview with her--the last for the\r\npresent--that I would then leave her, and set to work upon maturing my\r\nplan as fast as possible.  We got a chance of being alone together, and\r\nthen I gave myself the loose rein, and told her how passionately and\r\ndevotedly I loved her.  She said little in return, but her tears (which I\r\ncould not refrain from answering with my own) and the little she did say\r\nwere quite enough to show me that I should meet with no obstacle from\r\nher.  Then I asked her whether she would run a terrible risk which we\r\nshould share in common, if, in case of success, I could take her to my\r\nown people, to the home of my mother and sisters, who would welcome her\r\nvery gladly.  At the same time I pointed out that the chances of failure\r\nwere far greater than those of success, and that the probability was that\r\neven though I could get so far as to carry my design into execution, it\r\nwould end in death to us both.\r\n\r\nI was not mistaken in her; she said that she believed I loved her as much\r\nas she loved me, and that she would brave anything if I could only assure\r\nher that what I proposed would not be thought dishonourable in England;\r\nshe could not live without me, and would rather die with me than alone;\r\nthat death was perhaps the best for us both; that I must plan, and that\r\nwhen the hour came I was to send for her, and trust her not to fail me;\r\nand so after many tears and embraces, we tore ourselves away.\r\n\r\nI then left the Nosnibors, took a lodging in the town, and became\r\nmelancholy to my heart\'s content.  Arowhena and I used to see each other\r\nsometimes, for I had taken to going regularly to the Musical Banks, but\r\nMrs. Nosnibor and Zulora both treated me with considerable coldness.  I\r\nfelt sure that they suspected me.  Arowhena looked miserable, and I saw\r\nthat her purse was now always as full as she could fill it with the\r\nMusical Bank money--much fuller than of old.  Then the horrible thought\r\noccurred to me that her health might break down, and that she might be\r\nsubjected to a criminal prosecution.  Oh! how I hated Erewhon at that\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nI was still received at court, but my good looks were beginning to fail\r\nme, and I was not such an adept at concealing the effects of pain as the\r\nErewhonians are.  I could see that my friends began to look concerned\r\nabout me, and was obliged to take a leaf out of Mahaina\'s book, and\r\npretend to have developed a taste for drinking.  I even consulted a\r\nstraightener as though this were so, and submitted to much discomfort.\r\nThis made matters better for a time, but I could see that my friends\r\nthought less highly of my constitution as my flesh began to fall away.\r\n\r\nI was told that the poor made an outcry about my pension, and I saw a\r\nstinging article in an anti-ministerial paper, in which the writer went\r\nso far as to say that my having light hair reflected little credit upon\r\nme, inasmuch as I had been reported to have said that it was a common\r\nthing in the country from which I came.  I have reason to believe that\r\nMr. Nosnibor himself inspired this article.  Presently it came round to\r\nme that the king had begun to dwell upon my having been possessed of a\r\nwatch, and to say that I ought to be treated medicinally for having told\r\nhim a lie about the balloons.  I saw misfortune gathering round me in\r\nevery direction, and felt that I should have need of all my wits and a\r\ngood many more, if I was to steer myself and Arowhena to a good\r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\nThere were some who continued to show me kindness, and strange to say, I\r\nreceived the most from the very persons from whom I should have least\r\nexpected it--I mean from the cashiers of the Musical Banks.  I had made\r\nthe acquaintance of several of these persons, and now that I frequented\r\ntheir bank, they were inclined to make a good deal of me.  One of them,\r\nseeing that I was thoroughly out of health, though of course he pretended\r\nnot to notice it, suggested that I should take a little change of air and\r\ngo down with him to one of the principal towns, which was some two or\r\nthree days\' journey from the metropolis, and the chief seat of the\r\nColleges of Unreason; he assured me that I should be delighted with what\r\nI saw, and that I should receive a most hospitable welcome.  I determined\r\ntherefore to accept the invitation.\r\n\r\nWe started two or three days later, and after a night on the road, we\r\narrived at our destination towards evening.  It was now full spring, and\r\nas nearly as might be ten months since I had started with Chowbok on my\r\nexpedition, but it seemed more like ten years.  The trees were in their\r\nfreshest beauty, and the air had become warm without being oppressively\r\nhot.  After having lived so many months in the metropolis, the sight of\r\nthe country, and the country villages through which we passed refreshed\r\nme greatly, but I could not forget my troubles.  The last five miles or\r\nso were the most beautiful part of the journey, for the country became\r\nmore undulating, and the woods were more extensive; but the first sight\r\nof the city of the colleges itself was the most delightful of all.  I\r\ncannot imagine that there can be any fairer in the whole world, and I\r\nexpressed my pleasure to my companion, and thanked him for having brought\r\nme.\r\n\r\nWe drove to an inn in the middle of the town, and then, while it was\r\nstill light, my friend the cashier, whose name was Thims, took me for a\r\nstroll in the streets and in the court-yards of the principal colleges.\r\nTheir beauty and interest were extreme; it was impossible to see them\r\nwithout being attracted towards them; and I thought to myself that he\r\nmust be indeed an ill-grained and ungrateful person who can have been a\r\nmember of one of these colleges without retaining an affectionate feeling\r\ntowards it for the rest of his life.  All my misgivings gave way at once\r\nwhen I saw the beauty and venerable appearance of this delightful city.\r\nFor half-an-hour I forgot both myself and Arowhena.\r\n\r\nAfter supper Mr. Thims told me a good deal about the system of education\r\nwhich is here practised.  I already knew a part of what I heard, but much\r\nwas new to me, and I obtained a better idea of the Erewhonian position\r\nthan I had done hitherto: nevertheless there were parts of the scheme of\r\nwhich I could not comprehend the fitness, although I fully admit that\r\nthis inability was probably the result of my having been trained so very\r\ndifferently, and to my being then much out of sorts.\r\n\r\nThe main feature in their system is the prominence which they give to a\r\nstudy which I can only translate by the word "hypothetics."  They argue\r\nthus--that to teach a boy merely the nature of the things which exist in\r\nthe world around him, and about which he will have to be conversant\r\nduring his whole life, would be giving him but a narrow and shallow\r\nconception of the universe, which it is urged might contain all manner of\r\nthings which are not now to be found therein.  To open his eyes to these\r\npossibilities, and so to prepare him for all sorts of emergencies, is the\r\nobject of this system of hypothetics.  To imagine a set of utterly\r\nstrange and impossible contingencies, and require the youths to give\r\nintelligent answers to the questions that arise therefrom, is reckoned\r\nthe fittest conceivable way of preparing them for the actual conduct of\r\ntheir affairs in after life.\r\n\r\nThus they are taught what is called the hypothetical language for many of\r\ntheir best years--a language which was originally composed at a time when\r\nthe country was in a very different state of civilisation to what it is\r\nat present, a state which has long since disappeared and been superseded.\r\nMany valuable maxims and noble thoughts which were at one time concealed\r\nin it have become current in their modern literature, and have been\r\ntranslated over and over again into the language now spoken.  Surely then\r\nit would seem enough that the study of the original language should be\r\nconfined to the few whose instincts led them naturally to pursue it.\r\n\r\nBut the Erewhonians think differently; the store they set by this\r\nhypothetical language can hardly be believed; they will even give any one\r\na maintenance for life if he attains a considerable proficiency in the\r\nstudy of it; nay, they will spend years in learning to translate some of\r\ntheir own good poetry into the hypothetical language--to do so with\r\nfluency being reckoned a distinguishing mark of a scholar and a\r\ngentleman.  Heaven forbid that I should be flippant, but it appeared to\r\nme to be a wanton waste of good human energy that men should spend years\r\nand years in the perfection of so barren an exercise, when their own\r\ncivilisation presented problems by the hundred which cried aloud for\r\nsolution and would have paid the solver handsomely; but people know their\r\nown affairs best.  If the youths chose it for themselves I should have\r\nwondered less; but they do not choose it; they have it thrust upon them,\r\nand for the most part are disinclined towards it.  I can only say that\r\nall I heard in defence of the system was insufficient to make me think\r\nvery highly of its advantages.\r\n\r\nThe arguments in favour of the deliberate development of the unreasoning\r\nfaculties were much more cogent.  But here they depart from the\r\nprinciples on which they justify their study of hypothetics; for they\r\nbase the importance which they assign to hypothetics upon the fact of\r\ntheir being a preparation for the extraordinary, while their study of\r\nUnreason rests upon its developing those faculties which are required for\r\nthe daily conduct of affairs.  Hence their professorships of\r\nInconsistency and Evasion, in both of which studies the youths are\r\nexamined before being allowed to proceed to their degree in hypothetics.\r\nThe more earnest and conscientious students attain to a proficiency in\r\nthese subjects which is quite surprising; there is hardly any\r\ninconsistency so glaring but they soon learn to defend it, or injunction\r\nso clear that they cannot find some pretext for disregarding it.\r\n\r\nLife, they urge, would be intolerable if men were to be guided in all\r\nthey did by reason and reason only.  Reason betrays men into the drawing\r\nof hard and fast lines, and to the defining by language--language being\r\nlike the sun, which rears and then scorches.  Extremes are alone logical,\r\nbut they are always absurd; the mean is illogical, but an illogical mean\r\nis better than the sheer absurdity of an extreme.  There are no follies\r\nand no unreasonablenesses so great as those which can apparently be\r\nirrefragably defended by reason itself, and there is hardly an error into\r\nwhich men may not easily be led if they base their conduct upon reason\r\nonly.\r\n\r\nReason might very possibly abolish the double currency; it might even\r\nattack the personality of Hope and Justice.  Besides, people have such a\r\nstrong natural bias towards it that they will seek it for themselves and\r\nact upon it quite as much as or more than is good for them: there is no\r\nneed of encouraging reason.  With unreason the case is different.  She is\r\nthe natural complement of reason, without whose existence reason itself\r\nwere non-existent.\r\n\r\nIf, then, reason would be non-existent were there no such thing as\r\nunreason, surely it follows that the more unreason there is, the more\r\nreason there must be also?  Hence the necessity for the development of\r\nunreason, even in the interests of reason herself.  The Professors of\r\nUnreason deny that they undervalue reason: none can be more convinced\r\nthan they are, that if the double currency cannot be rigorously deduced\r\nas a necessary consequence of human reason, the double currency should\r\ncease forthwith; but they say that it must be deduced from no narrow and\r\nexclusive view of reason which should deprive that admirable faculty of\r\nthe one-half of its own existence.  Unreason is a part of reason; it must\r\ntherefore be allowed its full share in stating the initial conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII: THE COLLEGES OF UNREASON--Continued\r\n\r\n\r\nOf genius they make no account, for they say that every one is a genius,\r\nmore or less.  No one is so physically sound that no part of him will be\r\neven a little unsound, and no one is so diseased but that some part of\r\nhim will be healthy--so no man is so mentally and morally sound, but that\r\nhe will be in part both mad and wicked; and no man is so mad and wicked\r\nbut he will be sensible and honourable in part.  In like manner there is\r\nno genius who is not also a fool, and no fool who is not also a genius.\r\n\r\nWhen I talked about originality and genius to some gentlemen whom I met\r\nat a supper party given by Mr. Thims in my honour, and said that original\r\nthought ought to be encouraged, I had to eat my words at once.  Their\r\nview evidently was that genius was like offences--needs must that it\r\ncome, but woe unto that man through whom it comes.  A man\'s business,\r\nthey hold, is to think as his neighbours do, for Heaven help him if he\r\nthinks good what they count bad.  And really it is hard to see how the\r\nErewhonian theory differs from our own, for the word "idiot" only means a\r\nperson who forms his opinions for himself.\r\n\r\nThe venerable Professor of Worldly Wisdom, a man verging on eighty but\r\nstill hale, spoke to me very seriously on this subject in consequence of\r\nthe few words that I had imprudently let fall in defence of genius.  He\r\nwas one of those who carried most weight in the university, and had the\r\nreputation of having done more perhaps than any other living man to\r\nsuppress any kind of originality.\r\n\r\n"It is not our business," he said, "to help students to think for\r\nthemselves.  Surely this is the very last thing which one who wishes them\r\nwell should encourage them to do.  Our duty is to ensure that they shall\r\nthink as we do, or at any rate, as we hold it expedient to say we do."  In\r\nsome respects, however, he was thought to hold somewhat radical opinions,\r\nfor he was President of the Society for the Suppression of Useless\r\nKnowledge, and for the Completer Obliteration of the Past.\r\n\r\nAs regards the tests that a youth must pass before he can get a degree, I\r\nfound that they have no class lists, and discourage anything like\r\ncompetition among the students; this, indeed, they regard as self-seeking\r\nand unneighbourly.  The examinations are conducted by way of papers\r\nwritten by the candidate on set subjects, some of which are known to him\r\nbeforehand, while others are devised with a view of testing his general\r\ncapacity and _savoir faire_.\r\n\r\nMy friend the Professor of Worldly Wisdom was the terror of the greater\r\nnumber of students; and, so far as I could judge, he very well might be,\r\nfor he had taken his Professorship more seriously than any of the other\r\nProfessors had done.  I heard of his having plucked one poor fellow for\r\nwant of sufficient vagueness in his saving clauses paper.  Another was\r\nsent down for having written an article on a scientific subject without\r\nhaving made free enough use of the words "carefully," "patiently," and\r\n"earnestly."  One man was refused a degree for being too often and too\r\nseriously in the right, while a few days before I came a whole batch had\r\nbeen plucked for insufficient distrust of printed matter.\r\n\r\nAbout this there was just then rather a ferment, for it seems that the\r\nProfessor had written an article in the leading university magazine,\r\nwhich was well known to be by him, and which abounded in all sorts of\r\nplausible blunders.  He then set a paper which afforded the examinees an\r\nopportunity of repeating these blunders--which, believing the article to\r\nbe by their own examiner, they of course did.  The Professor plucked\r\nevery single one of them, but his action was considered to have been not\r\nquite handsome.\r\n\r\nI told them of Homer\'s noble line to the effect that a man should strive\r\never to be foremost and in all things to outvie his peers; but they said\r\nthat no wonder the countries in which such a detestable maxim was held in\r\nadmiration were always flying at one another\'s throats.\r\n\r\n"Why," asked one Professor, "should a man want to be better than his\r\nneighbours?  Let him be thankful if he is no worse."\r\n\r\nI ventured feebly to say that I did not see how progress could be made in\r\nany art or science, or indeed in anything at all, without more or less\r\nself-seeking, and hence unamiability.\r\n\r\n"Of course it cannot," said the Professor, "and therefore we object to\r\nprogress."\r\n\r\nAfter which there was no more to be said.  Later on, however, a young\r\nProfessor took me aside and said he did not think I quite understood\r\ntheir views about progress.\r\n\r\n"We like progress," he said, "but it must commend itself to the common\r\nsense of the people.  If a man gets to know more than his neighbours he\r\nshould keep his knowledge to himself till he has sounded them, and seen\r\nwhether they agree, or are likely to agree with him.  He said it was as\r\nimmoral to be too far in front of one\'s own age, as to lag too far behind\r\nit.  If a man can carry his neighbours with him, he may say what he\r\nlikes; but if not, what insult can be more gratuitous than the telling\r\nthem what they do not want to know?  A man should remember that\r\nintellectual over-indulgence is one of the most insidious and disgraceful\r\nforms that excess can take.  Granted that every one should exceed more or\r\nless, inasmuch as absolutely perfect sanity would drive any man mad the\r\nmoment he reached it, but . . . "\r\n\r\nHe was now warming to his subject and I was beginning to wonder how I\r\nshould get rid of him, when the party broke up, and though I promised to\r\ncall on him before I left, I was unfortunately prevented from doing so.\r\n\r\nI have now said enough to give English readers some idea of the strange\r\nviews which the Erewhonians hold concerning unreason, hypothetics, and\r\neducation generally.  In many respects they were sensible enough, but I\r\ncould not get over the hypothetics, especially the turning their own good\r\npoetry into the hypothetical language.  In the course of my stay I met\r\none youth who told me that for fourteen years the hypothetical language\r\nhad been almost the only thing that he had been taught, although he had\r\nnever (to his credit, as it seemed to me) shown the slightest proclivity\r\ntowards it, while he had been endowed with not inconsiderable ability for\r\nseveral other branches of human learning.  He assured me that he would\r\nnever open another hypothetical book after he had taken his degree, but\r\nwould follow out the bent of his own inclinations.  This was well enough,\r\nbut who could give him his fourteen years back again?\r\n\r\nI sometimes wondered how it was that the mischief done was not more\r\nclearly perceptible, and that the young men and women grew up as sensible\r\nand goodly as they did, in spite of the attempts almost deliberately made\r\nto warp and stunt their growth.  Some doubtless received damage, from\r\nwhich they suffered to their life\'s end; but many seemed little or none\r\nthe worse, and some, almost the better.  The reason would seem to be that\r\nthe natural instinct of the lads in most cases so absolutely rebelled\r\nagainst their training, that do what the teachers might they could never\r\nget them to pay serious heed to it.  The consequence was that the boys\r\nonly lost their time, and not so much of this as might have been\r\nexpected, for in their hours of leisure they were actively engaged in\r\nexercises and sports which developed their physical nature, and made them\r\nat any rate strong and healthy.\r\n\r\nMoreover those who had any special tastes could not be restrained from\r\ndeveloping them: they would learn what they wanted to learn and liked, in\r\nspite of obstacles which seemed rather to urge them on than to discourage\r\nthem, while for those who had no special capacity, the loss of time was\r\nof comparatively little moment; but in spite of these alleviations of the\r\nmischief, I am sure that much harm was done to the children of the sub-\r\nwealthy classes, by the system which passes current among the Erewhonians\r\nas education.  The poorest children suffered least--if destruction and\r\ndeath have heard the sound of wisdom, to a certain extent poverty has\r\ndone so also.\r\n\r\nAnd yet perhaps, after all, it is better for a country that its seats of\r\nlearning should do more to suppress mental growth than to encourage it.\r\nWere it not for a certain priggishness which these places infuse into so\r\ngreat a number of their _alumni_, genuine work would become dangerously\r\ncommon.  It is essential that by far the greater part of what is said or\r\ndone in the world should be so ephemeral as to take itself away quickly;\r\nit should keep good for twenty-four hours, or even twice as long, but it\r\nshould not be good enough a week hence to prevent people from going on to\r\nsomething else.  No doubt the marvellous development of journalism in\r\nEngland, as also the fact that our seats of learning aim rather at\r\nfostering mediocrity than anything higher, is due to our subconscious\r\nrecognition of the fact that it is even more necessary to check\r\nexuberance of mental development than to encourage it.  There can be no\r\ndoubt that this is what our academic bodies do, and they do it the more\r\neffectually because they do it only subconsciously.  They think they are\r\nadvancing healthy mental assimilation and digestion, whereas in reality\r\nthey are little better than cancer in the stomach.\r\n\r\nLet me return, however, to the Erewhonians.  Nothing surprised me more\r\nthan to see the occasional flashes of common sense with which one branch\r\nof study or another was lit up, while not a single ray fell upon so many\r\nothers.  I was particularly struck with this on strolling into the Art\r\nSchool of the University.  Here I found that the course of study was\r\ndivided into two branches--the practical and the commercial--no student\r\nbeing permitted to continue his studies in the actual practice of the art\r\nhe had taken up, unless he made equal progress in its commercial history.\r\n\r\nThus those who were studying painting were examined at frequent intervals\r\nin the prices which all the leading pictures of the last fifty or a\r\nhundred years had realised, and in the fluctuations in their values when\r\n(as often happened) they had been sold and resold three or four times.\r\nThe artist, they contend, is a dealer in pictures, and it is as important\r\nfor him to learn how to adapt his wares to the market, and to know\r\napproximately what kind of a picture will fetch how much, as it is for\r\nhim to be able to paint the picture.  This, I suppose, is what the French\r\nmean by laying so much stress upon "values."\r\n\r\nAs regards the city itself, the more I saw the more enchanted I became.  I\r\ndare not trust myself with any description of the exquisite beauty of the\r\ndifferent colleges, and their walks and gardens.  Truly in these things\r\nalone there must be a hallowing and refining influence which is in itself\r\nhalf an education, and which no amount of error can wholly spoil.  I was\r\nintroduced to many of the Professors, who showed me every hospitality and\r\nkindness; nevertheless I could hardly avoid a sort of suspicion that some\r\nof those whom I was taken to see had been so long engrossed in their own\r\nstudy of hypothetics that they had become the exact antitheses of the\r\nAthenians in the days of St. Paul; for whereas the Athenians spent their\r\nlives in nothing save to see and to hear some new thing, there were some\r\nhere who seemed to devote themselves to the avoidance of every opinion\r\nwith which they were not perfectly familiar, and regarded their own\r\nbrains as a sort of sanctuary, to which if an opinion had once resorted,\r\nnone other was to attack it.\r\n\r\nI should warn the reader, however, that I was rarely sure what the men\r\nwhom I met while staying with Mr. Thims really meant; for there was no\r\ngetting anything out of them if they scented even a suspicion that they\r\nmight be what they call "giving themselves away."  As there is hardly any\r\nsubject on which this suspicion cannot arise, I found it difficult to get\r\ndefinite opinions from any of them, except on such subjects as the\r\nweather, eating and drinking, holiday excursions, or games of skill.\r\n\r\nIf they cannot wriggle out of expressing an opinion of some sort, they\r\nwill commonly retail those of some one who has already written upon the\r\nsubject, and conclude by saying that though they quite admit that there\r\nis an element of truth in what the writer has said, there are many points\r\non which they are unable to agree with him.  Which these points were, I\r\ninvariably found myself unable to determine; indeed, it seemed to be\r\ncounted the perfection of scholarship and good breeding among them not to\r\nhave--much less to express--an opinion on any subject on which it might\r\nprove later that they had been mistaken.  The art of sitting gracefully\r\non a fence has never, I should think, been brought to greater perfection\r\nthan at the Erewhonian Colleges of Unreason.\r\n\r\nEven when, wriggle as they may, they find themselves pinned down to some\r\nexpression of definite opinion, as often as not they will argue in\r\nsupport of what they perfectly well know to be untrue.  I repeatedly met\r\nwith reviews and articles even in their best journals, between the lines\r\nof which I had little difficulty in detecting a sense exactly contrary to\r\nthe one ostensibly put forward.  So well is this understood, that a man\r\nmust be a mere tyro in the arts of Erewhonian polite society, unless he\r\ninstinctively suspects a hidden "yea" in every "nay" that meets him.\r\nGranted that it comes to much the same in the end, for it does not matter\r\nwhether "yea" is called "yea" or "nay," so long as it is understood which\r\nit is to be; but our own more direct way of calling a spade a spade,\r\nrather than a rake, with the intention that every one should understand\r\nit as a spade, seems more satisfactory.  On the other hand, the\r\nErewhonian system lends itself better to the suppression of that\r\ndownrightness which it seems the express aim of Erewhonian philosophy to\r\ndiscountenance.\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, the fear-of-giving-themselves-away disease was fatal\r\nto the intelligence of those infected by it, and almost every one at the\r\nColleges of Unreason had caught it to a greater or less degree.  After a\r\nfew years atrophy of the opinions invariably supervened, and the sufferer\r\nbecame stone dead to everything except the more superficial aspects of\r\nthose material objects with which he came most in contact.  The\r\nexpression on the faces of these people was repellent; they did not,\r\nhowever, seem particularly unhappy, for they none of them had the\r\nfaintest idea that they were in reality more dead than alive.  No cure\r\nfor this disgusting fear-of-giving-themselves-away disease has yet been\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nIt was during my stay in City of the Colleges of Unreason--a city whose\r\nErewhonian name is so cacophonous that I refrain from giving it--that I\r\nlearned the particulars of the revolution which had ended in the\r\ndestruction of so many of the mechanical inventions which were formerly\r\nin common use.\r\n\r\nMr. Thims took me to the rooms of a gentleman who had a great reputation\r\nfor learning, but who was also, so Mr. Thims told me, rather a dangerous\r\nperson, inasmuch as he had attempted to introduce an adverb into the\r\nhypothetical language.  He had heard of my watch and been exceedingly\r\nanxious to see me, for he was accounted the most learned antiquary in\r\nErewhon on the subject of mechanical lore.  We fell to talking upon the\r\nsubject, and when I left he gave me a reprinted copy of the work which\r\nbrought the revolution about.\r\n\r\nIt had taken place some five hundred years before my arrival: people had\r\nlong become thoroughly used to the change, although at the time that it\r\nwas made the country was plunged into the deepest misery, and a reaction\r\nwhich followed had very nearly proved successful.  Civil war raged for\r\nmany years, and is said to have reduced the number of the inhabitants by\r\none-half.  The parties were styled the machinists and the\r\nanti-machinists, and in the end, as I have said already, the latter got\r\nthe victory, treating their opponents with such unparalleled severity\r\nthat they extirpated every trace of opposition.\r\n\r\nThe wonder was that they allowed any mechanical appliances to remain in\r\nthe kingdom, neither do I believe that they would have done so, had not\r\nthe Professors of Inconsistency and Evasion made a stand against the\r\ncarrying of the new principles to their legitimate conclusions.  These\r\nProfessors, moreover, insisted that during the struggle the\r\nanti-machinists should use every known improvement in the art of war, and\r\nseveral new weapons, offensive and defensive, were invented, while it was\r\nin progress.  I was surprised at there remaining so many mechanical\r\nspecimens as are seen in the museums, and at students having rediscovered\r\ntheir past uses so completely; for at the time of the revolution the\r\nvictors wrecked all the more complicated machines, and burned all\r\ntreatises on mechanics, and all engineers\' workshops--thus, so they\r\nthought, cutting the mischief out root and branch, at an incalculable\r\ncost of blood and treasure.\r\n\r\nCertainly they had not spared their labour, but work of this description\r\ncan never be perfectly achieved, and when, some two hundred years before\r\nmy arrival, all passion upon the subject had cooled down, and no one save\r\na lunatic would have dreamed of reintroducing forbidden inventions, the\r\nsubject came to be regarded as a curious antiquarian study, like that of\r\nsome long-forgotten religious practices among ourselves.  Then came the\r\ncareful search for whatever fragments could be found, and for any\r\nmachines that might have been hidden away, and also numberless treatises\r\nwere written, showing what the functions of each rediscovered machine had\r\nbeen; all being done with no idea of using such machinery again, but with\r\nthe feelings of an English antiquarian concerning Druidical monuments or\r\nflint arrow heads.\r\n\r\nOn my return to the metropolis, during the remaining weeks or rather days\r\nof my sojourn in Erewhon I made a _resume_ in English of the work which\r\nbrought about the already mentioned revolution.  My ignorance of\r\ntechnical terms has led me doubtless into many errors, and I have\r\noccasionally, where I found translation impossible, substituted purely\r\nEnglish names and ideas for the original Erewhonian ones, but the reader\r\nmay rely on my general accuracy.  I have thought it best to insert my\r\ntranslation here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII: THE BOOK OF THE MACHINES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe writer commences:--"There was a time, when the earth was to all\r\nappearance utterly destitute both of animal and vegetable life, and when\r\naccording to the opinion of our best philosophers it was simply a hot\r\nround ball with a crust gradually cooling.  Now if a human being had\r\nexisted while the earth was in this state and had been allowed to see it\r\nas though it were some other world with which he had no concern, and if\r\nat the same time he were entirely ignorant of all physical science, would\r\nhe not have pronounced it impossible that creatures possessed of anything\r\nlike consciousness should be evolved from the seeming cinder which he was\r\nbeholding?  Would he not have denied that it contained any potentiality\r\nof consciousness?  Yet in the course of time consciousness came.  Is it\r\nnot possible then that there may be even yet new channels dug out for\r\nconsciousness, though we can detect no signs of them at present?\r\n\r\n"Again.  Consciousness, in anything like the present acceptation of the\r\nterm, having been once a new thing--a thing, as far as we can see,\r\nsubsequent even to an individual centre of action and to a reproductive\r\nsystem (which we see existing in plants without apparent\r\nconsciousness)--why may not there arise some new phase of mind which\r\nshall be as different from all present known phases, as the mind of\r\nanimals is from that of vegetables?\r\n\r\n"It would be absurd to attempt to define such a mental state (or whatever\r\nit may be called), inasmuch as it must be something so foreign to man\r\nthat his experience can give him no help towards conceiving its nature;\r\nbut surely when we reflect upon the manifold phases of life and\r\nconsciousness which have been evolved already, it would be rash to say\r\nthat no others can be developed, and that animal life is the end of all\r\nthings.  There was a time when fire was the end of all things: another\r\nwhen rocks and water were so."\r\n\r\nThe writer, after enlarging on the above for several pages, proceeded to\r\ninquire whether traces of the approach of such a new phase of life could\r\nbe perceived at present; whether we could see any tenements preparing\r\nwhich might in a remote futurity be adapted for it; whether, in fact, the\r\nprimordial cell of such a kind of life could be now detected upon earth.\r\nIn the course of his work he answered this question in the affirmative\r\nand pointed to the higher machines.\r\n\r\n"There is no security"--to quote his own words--"against the ultimate\r\ndevelopment of mechanical consciousness, in the fact of machines\r\npossessing little consciousness now.  A mollusc has not much\r\nconsciousness.  Reflect upon the extraordinary advance which machines\r\nhave made during the last few hundred years, and note how slowly the\r\nanimal and vegetable kingdoms are advancing.  The more highly organised\r\nmachines are creatures not so much of yesterday, as of the last five\r\nminutes, so to speak, in comparison with past time.  Assume for the sake\r\nof argument that conscious beings have existed for some twenty million\r\nyears: see what strides machines have made in the last thousand!  May not\r\nthe world last twenty million years longer?  If so, what will they not in\r\nthe end become?  Is it not safer to nip the mischief in the bud and to\r\nforbid them further progress?\r\n\r\n"But who can say that the vapour engine has not a kind of consciousness?\r\nWhere does consciousness begin, and where end?  Who can draw the line?\r\nWho can draw any line?  Is not everything interwoven with everything?  Is\r\nnot machinery linked with animal life in an infinite variety of ways?  The\r\nshell of a hen\'s egg is made of a delicate white ware and is a machine as\r\nmuch as an egg-cup is: the shell is a device for holding the egg, as much\r\nas the egg-cup for holding the shell: both are phases of the same\r\nfunction; the hen makes the shell in her inside, but it is pure pottery.\r\nShe makes her nest outside of herself for convenience\' sake, but the nest\r\nis not more of a machine than the egg-shell is.  A \'machine\' is only a\r\n\'device.\'"\r\n\r\nThen returning to consciousness, and endeavouring to detect its earliest\r\nmanifestations, the writer continued:-\r\n\r\n"There is a kind of plant that eats organic food with its flowers: when a\r\nfly settles upon the blossom, the petals close upon it and hold it fast\r\ntill the plant has absorbed the insect into its system; but they will\r\nclose on nothing but what is good to eat; of a drop of rain or a piece of\r\nstick they will take no notice.  Curious! that so unconscious a thing\r\nshould have such a keen eye to its own interest.  If this is\r\nunconsciousness, where is the use of consciousness?\r\n\r\n"Shall we say that the plant does not know what it is doing merely\r\nbecause it has no eyes, or ears, or brains?  If we say that it acts\r\nmechanically, and mechanically only, shall we not be forced to admit that\r\nsundry other and apparently very deliberate actions are also mechanical?\r\nIf it seems to us that the plant kills and eats a fly mechanically, may\r\nit not seem to the plant that a man must kill and eat a sheep\r\nmechanically?\r\n\r\n"But it may be said that the plant is void of reason, because the growth\r\nof a plant is an involuntary growth.  Given earth, air, and due\r\ntemperature, the plant must grow: it is like a clock, which being once\r\nwound up will go till it is stopped or run down: it is like the wind\r\nblowing on the sails of a ship--the ship must go when the wind blows it.\r\nBut can a healthy boy help growing if he have good meat and drink and\r\nclothing? can anything help going as long as it is wound up, or go on\r\nafter it is run down?  Is there not a winding up process everywhere?\r\n\r\n"Even a potato {5} in a dark cellar has a certain low cunning about him\r\nwhich serves him in excellent stead.  He knows perfectly well what he\r\nwants and how to get it.  He sees the light coming from the cellar window\r\nand sends his shoots crawling straight thereto: they will crawl along the\r\nfloor and up the wall and out at the cellar window; if there be a little\r\nearth anywhere on the journey he will find it and use it for his own\r\nends.  What deliberation he may exercise in the matter of his roots when\r\nhe is planted in the earth is a thing unknown to us, but we can imagine\r\nhim saying, \'I will have a tuber here and a tuber there, and I will suck\r\nwhatsoever advantage I can from all my surroundings.  This neighbour I\r\nwill overshadow, and that I will undermine; and what I can do shall be\r\nthe limit of what I will do.  He that is stronger and better placed than\r\nI shall overcome me, and him that is weaker I will overcome.\'\r\n\r\n"The potato says these things by doing them, which is the best of\r\nlanguages.  What is consciousness if this is not consciousness?  We find\r\nit difficult to sympathise with the emotions of a potato; so we do with\r\nthose of an oyster.  Neither of these things makes a noise on being\r\nboiled or opened, and noise appeals to us more strongly than anything\r\nelse, because we make so much about our own sufferings.  Since, then,\r\nthey do not annoy us by any expression of pain we call them emotionless;\r\nand so _qua_ mankind they are; but mankind is not everybody.\r\n\r\n"If it be urged that the action of the potato is chemical and mechanical\r\nonly, and that it is due to the chemical and mechanical effects of light\r\nand heat, the answer would seem to lie in an inquiry whether every\r\nsensation is not chemical and mechanical in its operation? whether those\r\nthings which we deem most purely spiritual are anything but disturbances\r\nof equilibrium in an infinite series of levers, beginning with those that\r\nare too small for microscopic detection, and going up to the human arm\r\nand the appliances which it makes use of? whether there be not a\r\nmolecular action of thought, whence a dynamical theory of the passions\r\nshall be deducible?  Whether strictly speaking we should not ask what\r\nkind of levers a man is made of rather than what is his temperament?  How\r\nare they balanced?  How much of such and such will it take to weigh them\r\ndown so as to make him do so and so?"\r\n\r\nThe writer went on to say that he anticipated a time when it would be\r\npossible, by examining a single hair with a powerful microscope, to know\r\nwhether its owner could be insulted with impunity.  He then became more\r\nand more obscure, so that I was obliged to give up all attempt at\r\ntranslation; neither did I follow the drift of his argument.  On coming\r\nto the next part which I could construe, I found that he had changed his\r\nground.\r\n\r\n"Either," he proceeds, "a great deal of action that has been called\r\npurely mechanical and unconscious must be admitted to contain more\r\nelements of consciousness than has been allowed hitherto (and in this\r\ncase germs of consciousness will be found in many actions of the higher\r\nmachines)--Or (assuming the theory of evolution but at the same time\r\ndenying the consciousness of vegetable and crystalline action) the race\r\nof man has descended from things which had no consciousness at all.  In\r\nthis case there is no _a priori_ improbability in the descent of\r\nconscious (and more than conscious) machines from those which now exist,\r\nexcept that which is suggested by the apparent absence of anything like a\r\nreproductive system in the mechanical kingdom.  This absence however is\r\nonly apparent, as I shall presently show.\r\n\r\n"Do not let me be misunderstood as living in fear of any actually\r\nexisting machine; there is probably no known machine which is more than a\r\nprototype of future mechanical life.  The present machines are to the\r\nfuture as the early Saurians to man.  The largest of them will probably\r\ngreatly diminish in size.  Some of the lowest vertebrate attained a much\r\ngreater bulk than has descended to their more highly organised living\r\nrepresentatives, and in like manner a diminution in the size of machines\r\nhas often attended their development and progress.\r\n\r\n"Take the watch, for example; examine its beautiful structure; observe\r\nthe intelligent play of the minute members which compose it: yet this\r\nlittle creature is but a development of the cumbrous clocks that preceded\r\nit; it is no deterioration from them.  A day may come when clocks, which\r\ncertainly at the present time are not diminishing in bulk, will be\r\nsuperseded owing to the universal use of watches, in which case they will\r\nbecome as extinct as ichthyosauri, while the watch, whose tendency has\r\nfor some years been to decrease in size rather than the contrary, will\r\nremain the only existing type of an extinct race.\r\n\r\n"But returning to the argument, I would repeat that I fear none of the\r\nexisting machines; what I fear is the extraordinary rapidity with which\r\nthey are becoming something very different to what they are at present.\r\nNo class of beings have in any time past made so rapid a movement\r\nforward.  Should not that movement be jealously watched, and checked\r\nwhile we can still check it?  And is it not necessary for this end to\r\ndestroy the more advanced of the machines which are in use at present,\r\nthough it is admitted that they are in themselves harmless?\r\n\r\n"As yet the machines receive their impressions through the agency of\r\nman\'s senses: one travelling machine calls to another in a shrill accent\r\nof alarm and the other instantly retires; but it is through the ears of\r\nthe driver that the voice of the one has acted upon the other.  Had there\r\nbeen no driver, the callee would have been deaf to the caller.  There was\r\na time when it must have seemed highly improbable that machines should\r\nlearn to make their wants known by sound, even through the ears of man;\r\nmay we not conceive, then, that a day will come when those ears will be\r\nno longer needed, and the hearing will be done by the delicacy of the\r\nmachine\'s own construction?--when its language shall have been developed\r\nfrom the cry of animals to a speech as intricate as our own?\r\n\r\n"It is possible that by that time children will learn the differential\r\ncalculus--as they learn now to speak--from their mothers and nurses, or\r\nthat they may talk in the hypothetical language, and work rule of three\r\nsums, as soon as they are born; but this is not probable; we cannot\r\ncalculate on any corresponding advance in man\'s intellectual or physical\r\npowers which shall be a set-off against the far greater development which\r\nseems in store for the machines.  Some people may say that man\'s moral\r\ninfluence will suffice to rule them; but I cannot think it will ever be\r\nsafe to repose much trust in the moral sense of any machine.\r\n\r\n"Again, might not the glory of the machines consist in their being\r\nwithout this same boasted gift of language?  \'Silence,\' it has been said\r\nby one writer, \'is a virtue which renders us agreeable to our\r\nfellow-creatures.\'"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV: THE MACHINES--continued\r\n\r\n\r\n"But other questions come upon us.  What is a man\'s eye but a machine for\r\nthe little creature that sits behind in his brain to look through?  A\r\ndead eye is nearly as good as a living one for some time after the man is\r\ndead.  It is not the eye that cannot see, but the restless one that\r\ncannot see through it.  Is it man\'s eyes, or is it the big seeing-engine\r\nwhich has revealed to us the existence of worlds beyond worlds into\r\ninfinity?  What has made man familiar with the scenery of the moon, the\r\nspots on the sun, or the geography of the planets?  He is at the mercy of\r\nthe seeing-engine for these things, and is powerless unless he tack it on\r\nto his own identity, and make it part and parcel of himself.  Or, again,\r\nis it the eye, or the little see-engine, which has shown us the existence\r\nof infinitely minute organisms which swarm unsuspected around us?\r\n\r\n"And take man\'s vaunted power of calculation.  Have we not engines which\r\ncan do all manner of sums more quickly and correctly than we can?  What\r\nprizeman in Hypothetics at any of our Colleges of Unreason can compare\r\nwith some of these machines in their own line?  In fact, wherever\r\nprecision is required man flies to the machine at once, as far preferable\r\nto himself.  Our sum-engines never drop a figure, nor our looms a stitch;\r\nthe machine is brisk and active, when the man is weary; it is\r\nclear-headed and collected, when the man is stupid and dull; it needs no\r\nslumber, when man must sleep or drop; ever at its post, ever ready for\r\nwork, its alacrity never flags, its patience never gives in; its might is\r\nstronger than combined hundreds, and swifter than the flight of birds; it\r\ncan burrow beneath the earth, and walk upon the largest rivers and sink\r\nnot.  This is the green tree; what then shall be done in the dry?\r\n\r\n"Who shall say that a man does see or hear?  He is such a hive and swarm\r\nof parasites that it is doubtful whether his body is not more theirs than\r\nhis, and whether he is anything but another kind of ant-heap after all.\r\nMay not man himself become a sort of parasite upon the machines?  An\r\naffectionate machine-tickling aphid?\r\n\r\n"It is said by some that our blood is composed of infinite living agents\r\nwhich go up and down the highways and byways of our bodies as people in\r\nthe streets of a city.  When we look down from a high place upon crowded\r\nthoroughfares, is it possible not to think of corpuscles of blood\r\ntravelling through veins and nourishing the heart of the town?  No\r\nmention shall be made of sewers, nor of the hidden nerves which serve to\r\ncommunicate sensations from one part of the town\'s body to another; nor\r\nof the yawning jaws of the railway stations, whereby the circulation is\r\ncarried directly into the heart,--which receive the venous lines, and\r\ndisgorge the arterial, with an eternal pulse of people.  And the sleep of\r\nthe town, how life-like! with its change in the circulation."\r\n\r\nHere the writer became again so hopelessly obscure that I was obliged to\r\nmiss several pages.  He resumed:-\r\n\r\n"It can be answered that even though machines should hear never so well\r\nand speak never so wisely, they will still always do the one or the other\r\nfor our advantage, not their own; that man will be the ruling spirit and\r\nthe machine the servant; that as soon as a machine fails to discharge the\r\nservice which man expects from it, it is doomed to extinction; that the\r\nmachines stand to man simply in the relation of lower animals, the vapour-\r\nengine itself being only a more economical kind of horse; so that instead\r\nof being likely to be developed into a higher kind of life than man\'s,\r\nthey owe their very existence and progress to their power of ministering\r\nto human wants, and must therefore both now and ever be man\'s inferiors.\r\n\r\n"This is all very well.  But the servant glides by imperceptible\r\napproaches into the master; and we have come to such a pass that, even\r\nnow, man must suffer terribly on ceasing to benefit the machines.  If all\r\nmachines were to be annihilated at one moment, so that not a knife nor\r\nlever nor rag of clothing nor anything whatsoever were left to man but\r\nhis bare body alone that he was born with, and if all knowledge of\r\nmechanical laws were taken from him so that he could make no more\r\nmachines, and all machine-made food destroyed so that the race of man\r\nshould be left as it were naked upon a desert island, we should become\r\nextinct in six weeks.  A few miserable individuals might linger, but even\r\nthese in a year or two would become worse than monkeys.  Man\'s very soul\r\nis due to the machines; it is a machine-made thing: he thinks as he\r\nthinks, and feels as he feels, through the work that machines have\r\nwrought upon him, and their existence is quite as much a _sine qua non_\r\nfor his, as his for theirs.  This fact precludes us from proposing the\r\ncomplete annihilation of machinery, but surely it indicates that we\r\nshould destroy as many of them as we can possibly dispense with, lest\r\nthey should tyrannise over us even more completely.\r\n\r\n"True, from a low materialistic point of view, it would seem that those\r\nthrive best who use machinery wherever its use is possible with profit;\r\nbut this is the art of the machines--they serve that they may rule.  They\r\nbear no malice towards man for destroying a whole race of them provided\r\nhe creates a better instead; on the contrary, they reward him liberally\r\nfor having hastened their development.  It is for neglecting them that he\r\nincurs their wrath, or for using inferior machines, or for not making\r\nsufficient exertions to invent new ones, or for destroying them without\r\nreplacing them; yet these are the very things we ought to do, and do\r\nquickly; for though our rebellion against their infant power will cause\r\ninfinite suffering, what will not things come to, if that rebellion is\r\ndelayed?\r\n\r\n"They have preyed upon man\'s grovelling preference for his material over\r\nhis spiritual interests, and have betrayed him into supplying that\r\nelement of struggle and warfare without which no race can advance.  The\r\nlower animals progress because they struggle with one another; the weaker\r\ndie, the stronger breed and transmit their strength.  The machines being\r\nof themselves unable to struggle, have got man to do their struggling for\r\nthem: as long as he fulfils this function duly, all goes well with him--at\r\nleast he thinks so; but the moment he fails to do his best for the\r\nadvancement of machinery by encouraging the good and destroying the bad,\r\nhe is left behind in the race of competition; and this means that he will\r\nbe made uncomfortable in a variety of ways, and perhaps die.\r\n\r\n"So that even now the machines will only serve on condition of being\r\nserved, and that too upon their own terms; the moment their terms are not\r\ncomplied with, they jib, and either smash both themselves and all whom\r\nthey can reach, or turn churlish and refuse to work at all.  How many men\r\nat this hour are living in a state of bondage to the machines?  How many\r\nspend their whole lives, from the cradle to the grave, in tending them by\r\nnight and day?  Is it not plain that the machines are gaining ground upon\r\nus, when we reflect on the increasing number of those who are bound down\r\nto them as slaves, and of those who devote their whole souls to the\r\nadvancement of the mechanical kingdom?\r\n\r\n"The vapour-engine must be fed with food and consume it by fire even as\r\nman consumes it; it supports its combustion by air as man supports it; it\r\nhas a pulse and circulation as man has.  It may be granted that man\'s\r\nbody is as yet the more versatile of the two, but then man\'s body is an\r\nolder thing; give the vapour-engine but half the time that man has had,\r\ngive it also a continuance of our present infatuation, and what may it\r\nnot ere long attain to?\r\n\r\n"There are certain functions indeed of the vapour-engine which will\r\nprobably remain unchanged for myriads of years--which in fact will\r\nperhaps survive when the use of vapour has been superseded: the piston\r\nand cylinder, the beam, the fly-wheel, and other parts of the machine\r\nwill probably be permanent, just as we see that man and many of the lower\r\nanimals share like modes of eating, drinking, and sleeping; thus they\r\nhave hearts which beat as ours, veins and arteries, eyes, ears, and\r\nnoses; they sigh even in their sleep, and weep and yawn; they are\r\naffected by their children; they feel pleasure and pain, hope, fear,\r\nanger, shame; they have memory and prescience; they know that if certain\r\nthings happen to them they will die, and they fear death as much as we\r\ndo; they communicate their thoughts to one another, and some of them\r\ndeliberately act in concert.  The comparison of similarities is endless:\r\nI only make it because some may say that since the vapour-engine is not\r\nlikely to be improved in the main particulars, it is unlikely to be\r\nhenceforward extensively modified at all.  This is too good to be true:\r\nit will be modified and suited for an infinite variety of purposes, as\r\nmuch as man has been modified so as to exceed the brutes in skill.\r\n\r\n"In the meantime the stoker is almost as much a cook for his engine as\r\nour own cooks for ourselves.  Consider also the colliers and pitmen and\r\ncoal merchants and coal trains, and the men who drive them, and the ships\r\nthat carry coals--what an army of servants do the machines thus employ!\r\nAre there not probably more men engaged in tending machinery than in\r\ntending men?  Do not machines eat as it were by mannery?  Are we not\r\nourselves creating our successors in the supremacy of the earth? daily\r\nadding to the beauty and delicacy of their organisation, daily giving\r\nthem greater skill and supplying more and more of that self-regulating\r\nself-acting power which will be better than any intellect?\r\n\r\n"What a new thing it is for a machine to feed at all!  The plough, the\r\nspade, and the cart must eat through man\'s stomach; the fuel that sets\r\nthem going must burn in the furnace of a man or of horses.  Man must\r\nconsume bread and meat or he cannot dig; the bread and meat are the fuel\r\nwhich drive the spade.  If a plough be drawn by horses, the power is\r\nsupplied by grass or beans or oats, which being burnt in the belly of the\r\ncattle give the power of working: without this fuel the work would cease,\r\nas an engine would stop if its furnaces were to go out.\r\n\r\n"A man of science has demonstrated \'that no animal has the power of\r\noriginating mechanical energy, but that all the work done in its life by\r\nany animal, and all the heat that has been emitted from it, and the heat\r\nwhich would be obtained by burning the combustible matter which has been\r\nlost from its body during life, and by burning its body after death, make\r\nup altogether an exact equivalent to the heat which would be obtained by\r\nburning as much food as it has used during its life, and an amount of\r\nfuel which would generate as much heat as its body if burned immediately\r\nafter death.\'  I do not know how he has found this out, but he is a man\r\nof science--how then can it be objected against the future vitality of\r\nthe machines that they are, in their present infancy, at the beck and\r\ncall of beings who are themselves incapable of originating mechanical\r\nenergy?\r\n\r\n"The main point, however, to be observed as affording cause for alarm is,\r\nthat whereas animals were formerly the only stomachs of the machines,\r\nthere are now many which have stomachs of their own, and consume their\r\nfood themselves.  This is a great step towards their becoming, if not\r\nanimate, yet something so near akin to it, as not to differ more widely\r\nfrom our own life than animals do from vegetables.  And though man should\r\nremain, in some respects, the higher creature, is not this in accordance\r\nwith the practice of nature, which allows superiority in some things to\r\nanimals which have, on the whole, been long surpassed?  Has she not\r\nallowed the ant and the bee to retain superiority over man in the\r\norganisation of their communities and social arrangements, the bird in\r\ntraversing the air, the fish in swimming, the horse in strength and\r\nfleetness, and the dog in self-sacrifice?\r\n\r\n"It is said by some with whom I have conversed upon this subject, that\r\nthe machines can never be developed into animate or _quasi_-animate\r\nexistences, inasmuch as they have no reproductive system, nor seem ever\r\nlikely to possess one.  If this be taken to mean that they cannot marry,\r\nand that we are never likely to see a fertile union between two vapour-\r\nengines with the young ones playing about the door of the shed, however\r\ngreatly we might desire to do so, I will readily grant it.  But the\r\nobjection is not a very profound one.  No one expects that all the\r\nfeatures of the now existing organisations will be absolutely repeated in\r\nan entirely new class of life.  The reproductive system of animals\r\ndiffers widely from that of plants, but both are reproductive systems.\r\nHas nature exhausted her phases of this power?\r\n\r\n"Surely if a machine is able to reproduce another machine systematically,\r\nwe may say that it has a reproductive system.  What is a reproductive\r\nsystem, if it be not a system for reproduction?  And how few of the\r\nmachines are there which have not been produced systematically by other\r\nmachines?  But it is man that makes them do so.  Yes; but is it not\r\ninsects that make many of the plants reproductive, and would not whole\r\nfamilies of plants die out if their fertilisation was not effected by a\r\nclass of agents utterly foreign to themselves?  Does any one say that the\r\nred clover has no reproductive system because the humble bee (and the\r\nhumble bee only) must aid and abet it before it can reproduce?  No one.\r\nThe humble bee is a part of the reproductive system of the clover.  Each\r\none of ourselves has sprung from minute animalcules whose entity was\r\nentirely distinct from our own, and which acted after their kind with no\r\nthought or heed of what we might think about it.  These little creatures\r\nare part of our own reproductive system; then why not we part of that of\r\nthe machines?\r\n\r\n"But the machines which reproduce machinery do not reproduce machines\r\nafter their own kind.  A thimble may be made by machinery, but it was not\r\nmade by, neither will it ever make, a thimble.  Here, again, if we turn\r\nto nature we shall find abundance of analogies which will teach us that a\r\nreproductive system may be in full force without the thing produced being\r\nof the same kind as that which produced it.  Very few creatures reproduce\r\nafter their own kind; they reproduce something which has the potentiality\r\nof becoming that which their parents were.  Thus the butterfly lays an\r\negg, which egg can become a caterpillar, which caterpillar can become a\r\nchrysalis, which chrysalis can become a butterfly; and though I freely\r\ngrant that the machines cannot be said to have more than the germ of a\r\ntrue reproductive system at present, have we not just seen that they have\r\nonly recently obtained the germs of a mouth and stomach?  And may not\r\nsome stride be made in the direction of true reproduction which shall be\r\nas great as that which has been recently taken in the direction of true\r\nfeeding?\r\n\r\n"It is possible that the system when developed may be in many cases a\r\nvicarious thing.  Certain classes of machines may be alone fertile, while\r\nthe rest discharge other functions in the mechanical system, just as the\r\ngreat majority of ants and bees have nothing to do with the continuation\r\nof their species, but get food and store it, without thought of breeding.\r\nOne cannot expect the parallel to be complete or nearly so; certainly not\r\nnow, and probably never; but is there not enough analogy existing at the\r\npresent moment, to make us feel seriously uneasy about the future, and to\r\nrender it our duty to check the evil while we can still do so?  Machines\r\ncan within certain limits beget machines of any class, no matter how\r\ndifferent to themselves.  Every class of machines will probably have its\r\nspecial mechanical breeders, and all the higher ones will owe their\r\nexistence to a large number of parents and not to two only.\r\n\r\n"We are misled by considering any complicated machine as a single thing;\r\nin truth it is a city or society, each member of which was bred truly\r\nafter its kind.  We see a machine as a whole, we call it by a name and\r\nindividualise it; we look at our own limbs, and know that the combination\r\nforms an individual which springs from a single centre of reproductive\r\naction; we therefore assume that there can be no reproductive action\r\nwhich does not arise from a single centre; but this assumption is\r\nunscientific, and the bare fact that no vapour-engine was ever made\r\nentirely by another, or two others, of its own kind, is not sufficient to\r\nwarrant us in saying that vapour-engines have no reproductive system.  The\r\ntruth is that each part of every vapour-engine is bred by its own special\r\nbreeders, whose function it is to breed that part, and that only, while\r\nthe combination of the parts into a whole forms another department of the\r\nmechanical reproductive system, which is at present exceedingly complex\r\nand difficult to see in its entirety.\r\n\r\n"Complex now, but how much simpler and more intelligibly organised may it\r\nnot become in another hundred thousand years? or in twenty thousand?  For\r\nman at present believes that his interest lies in that direction; he\r\nspends an incalculable amount of labour and time and thought in making\r\nmachines breed always better and better; he has already succeeded in\r\neffecting much that at one time appeared impossible, and there seem no\r\nlimits to the results of accumulated improvements if they are allowed to\r\ndescend with modification from generation to generation.  It must always\r\nbe remembered that man\'s body is what it is through having been moulded\r\ninto its present shape by the chances and changes of many millions of\r\nyears, but that his organisation never advanced with anything like the\r\nrapidity with which that of the machines is advancing.  This is the most\r\nalarming feature in the case, and I must be pardoned for insisting on it\r\nso frequently."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV: THE MACHINES--concluded\r\n\r\n\r\nHere followed a very long and untranslatable digression about the\r\ndifferent races and families of the then existing machines.  The writer\r\nattempted to support his theory by pointing out the similarities existing\r\nbetween many machines of a widely different character, which served to\r\nshow descent from a common ancestor.  He divided machines into their\r\ngenera, subgenera, species, varieties, subvarieties, and so forth.  He\r\nproved the existence of connecting links between machines that seemed to\r\nhave very little in common, and showed that many more such links had\r\nexisted, but had now perished.  He pointed out tendencies to reversion,\r\nand the presence of rudimentary organs which existed in many machines\r\nfeebly developed and perfectly useless, yet serving to mark descent from\r\nan ancestor to whom the function was actually useful.\r\n\r\nI left the translation of this part of the treatise, which, by the way,\r\nwas far longer than all that I have given here, for a later opportunity.\r\nUnfortunately, I left Erewhon before I could return to the subject; and\r\nthough I saved my translation and other papers at the hazard of my life,\r\nI was a obliged to sacrifice the original work.  It went to my heart to\r\ndo so; but I thus gained ten minutes of invaluable time, without which\r\nboth Arowhena and myself must have certainly perished.\r\n\r\nI remember one incident which bears upon this part of the treatise.  The\r\ngentleman who gave it to me had asked to see my tobacco-pipe; he examined\r\nit carefully, and when he came to the little protuberance at the bottom\r\nof the bowl he seemed much delighted, and exclaimed that it must be\r\nrudimentary.  I asked him what he meant.\r\n\r\n"Sir," he answered, "this organ is identical with the rim at the bottom\r\nof a cup; it is but another form of the same function.  Its purpose must\r\nhave been to keep the heat of the pipe from marking the table upon which\r\nit rested.  You would find, if you were to look up the history of tobacco-\r\npipes, that in early specimens this protuberance was of a different shape\r\nto what it is now.  It will have been broad at the bottom, and flat, so\r\nthat while the pipe was being smoked the bowl might rest upon the table\r\nwithout marking it.  Use and disuse must have come into play and reduced\r\nthe function to its present rudimentary condition.  I should not be\r\nsurprised, sir," he continued, "if, in the course of time, it were to\r\nbecome modified still farther, and to assume the form of an ornamental\r\nleaf or scroll, or even a butterfly, while, in some cases, it will become\r\nextinct."\r\n\r\nOn my return to England, I looked up the point, and found that my friend\r\nwas right.\r\n\r\nReturning, however, to the treatise, my translation recommences as\r\nfollows:-\r\n\r\n"May we not fancy that if, in the remotest geological period, some early\r\nform of vegetable life had been endowed with the power of reflecting upon\r\nthe dawning life of animals which was coming into existence alongside of\r\nits own, it would have thought itself exceedingly acute if it had\r\nsurmised that animals would one day become real vegetables?  Yet would\r\nthis be more mistaken than it would be on our part to imagine that\r\nbecause the life of machines is a very different one to our own, there is\r\ntherefore no higher possible development of life than ours; or that\r\nbecause mechanical life is a very different thing from ours, therefore\r\nthat it is not life at all?\r\n\r\n"But I have heard it said, \'granted that this is so, and that the vapour-\r\nengine has a strength of its own, surely no one will say that it has a\r\nwill of its own?\'  Alas! if we look more closely, we shall find that this\r\ndoes not make against the supposition that the vapour-engine is one of\r\nthe germs of a new phase of life.  What is there in this whole world, or\r\nin the worlds beyond it, which has a will of its own?  The Unknown and\r\nUnknowable only!\r\n\r\n"A man is the resultant and exponent of all the forces that have been\r\nbrought to bear upon him, whether before his birth or afterwards.  His\r\naction at any moment depends solely upon his constitution, and on the\r\nintensity and direction of the various agencies to which he is, and has\r\nbeen, subjected.  Some of these will counteract each other; but as he is\r\nby nature, and as he has been acted on, and is now acted on from without,\r\nso will he do, as certainly and regularly as though he were a machine.\r\n\r\n"We do not generally admit this, because we do not know the whole nature\r\nof any one, nor the whole of the forces that act upon him.  We see but a\r\npart, and being thus unable to generalise human conduct, except very\r\nroughly, we deny that it is subject to any fixed laws at all, and ascribe\r\nmuch both of a man\'s character and actions to chance, or luck, or\r\nfortune; but these are only words whereby we escape the admission of our\r\nown ignorance; and a little reflection will teach us that the most daring\r\nflight of the imagination or the most subtle exercise of the reason is as\r\nmuch the thing that must arise, and the only thing that can by any\r\npossibility arise, at the moment of its arising, as the falling of a dead\r\nleaf when the wind shakes it from the tree.\r\n\r\n"For the future depends upon the present, and the present (whose\r\nexistence is only one of those minor compromises of which human life is\r\nfull--for it lives only on sufferance of the past and future) depends\r\nupon the past, and the past is unalterable.  The only reason why we\r\ncannot see the future as plainly as the past, is because we know too\r\nlittle of the actual past and actual present; these things are too great\r\nfor us, otherwise the future, in its minutest details, would lie spread\r\nout before our eyes, and we should lose our sense of time present by\r\nreason of the clearness with which we should see the past and future;\r\nperhaps we should not be even able to distinguish time at all; but that\r\nis foreign.  What we do know is, that the more the past and present are\r\nknown, the more the future can be predicted; and that no one dreams of\r\ndoubting the fixity of the future in cases where he is fully cognisant of\r\nboth past and present, and has had experience of the consequences that\r\nfollowed from such a past and such a present on previous occasions.  He\r\nperfectly well knows what will happen, and will stake his whole fortune\r\nthereon.\r\n\r\n"And this is a great blessing; for it is the foundation on which morality\r\nand science are built.  The assurance that the future is no arbitrary and\r\nchangeable thing, but that like futures will invariably follow like\r\npresents, is the groundwork on which we lay all our plans--the faith on\r\nwhich we do every conscious action of our lives.  If this were not so we\r\nshould be without a guide; we should have no confidence in acting, and\r\nhence we should never act, for there would be no knowing that the results\r\nwhich will follow now will be the same as those which followed before.\r\n\r\n"Who would plough or sow if he disbelieved in the fixity of the future?\r\nWho would throw water on a blazing house if the action of water upon fire\r\nwere uncertain?  Men will only do their utmost when they feel certain\r\nthat the future will discover itself against them if their utmost has not\r\nbeen done.  The feeling of such a certainty is a constituent part of the\r\nsum of the forces at work upon them, and will act most powerfully on the\r\nbest and most moral men.  Those who are most firmly persuaded that the\r\nfuture is immutably bound up with the present in which their work is\r\nlying, will best husband their present, and till it with the greatest\r\ncare.  The future must be a lottery to those who think that the same\r\ncombinations can sometimes precede one set of results, and sometimes\r\nanother.  If their belief is sincere they will speculate instead of\r\nworking: these ought to be the immoral men; the others have the strongest\r\nspur to exertion and morality, if their belief is a living one.\r\n\r\n"The bearing of all this upon the machines is not immediately apparent,\r\nbut will become so presently.  In the meantime I must deal with friends\r\nwho tell me that, though the future is fixed as regards inorganic matter,\r\nand in some respects with regard to man, yet that there are many ways in\r\nwhich it cannot be considered as fixed.  Thus, they say that fire applied\r\nto dry shavings, and well fed with oxygen gas, will always produce a\r\nblaze, but that a coward brought into contact with a terrifying object\r\nwill not always result in a man running away.  Nevertheless, if there be\r\ntwo cowards perfectly similar in every respect, and if they be subjected\r\nin a perfectly similar way to two terrifying agents, which are themselves\r\nperfectly similar, there are few who will not expect a perfect similarity\r\nin the running away, even though a thousand years intervene between the\r\noriginal combination and its being repeated.\r\n\r\n"The apparently greater regularity in the results of chemical than of\r\nhuman combinations arises from our inability to perceive the subtle\r\ndifferences in human combinations--combinations which are never\r\nidentically repeated.  Fire we know, and shavings we know, but no two men\r\never were or ever will be exactly alike; and the smallest difference may\r\nchange the whole conditions of the problem.  Our registry of results must\r\nbe infinite before we could arrive at a full forecast of future\r\ncombinations; the wonder is that there is as much certainty concerning\r\nhuman action as there is; and assuredly the older we grow the more\r\ncertain we feel as to what such and such a kind of person will do in\r\ngiven circumstances; but this could never be the case unless human\r\nconduct were under the influence of laws, with the working of which we\r\nbecome more and more familiar through experience.\r\n\r\n"If the above is sound, it follows that the regularity with which\r\nmachinery acts is no proof of the absence of vitality, or at least of\r\ngerms which may be developed into a new phase of life.  At first sight it\r\nwould indeed appear that a vapour-engine cannot help going when set upon\r\na line of rails with the steam up and the machinery in full play; whereas\r\nthe man whose business it is to drive it can help doing so at any moment\r\nthat he pleases; so that the first has no spontaneity, and is not\r\npossessed of any sort of free will, while the second has and is.\r\n\r\n"This is true up to a certain point; the driver can stop the engine at\r\nany moment that he pleases, but he can only please to do so at certain\r\npoints which have been fixed for him by others, or in the case of\r\nunexpected obstructions which force him to please to do so.  His pleasure\r\nis not spontaneous; there is an unseen choir of influences around him,\r\nwhich make it impossible for him to act in any other way than one.  It is\r\nknown beforehand how much strength must be given to these influences,\r\njust as it is known beforehand how much coal and water are necessary for\r\nthe vapour-engine itself; and curiously enough it will be found that the\r\ninfluences brought to bear upon the driver are of the same kind as those\r\nbrought to bear upon the engine--that is to say, food and warmth.  The\r\ndriver is obedient to his masters, because he gets food and warmth from\r\nthem, and if these are withheld or given in insufficient quantities he\r\nwill cease to drive; in like manner the engine will cease to work if it\r\nis insufficiently fed.  The only difference is, that the man is conscious\r\nabout his wants, and the engine (beyond refusing to work) does not seem\r\nto be so; but this is temporary, and has been dealt with above.\r\n\r\n"Accordingly, the requisite strength being given to the motives that are\r\nto drive the driver, there has never, or hardly ever, been an instance of\r\na man stopping his engine through wantonness.  But such a case might\r\noccur; yes, and it might occur that the engine should break down: but if\r\nthe train is stopped from some trivial motive it will be found either\r\nthat the strength of the necessary influences has been miscalculated, or\r\nthat the man has been miscalculated, in the same way as an engine may\r\nbreak down from an unsuspected flaw; but even in such a case there will\r\nhave been no spontaneity; the action will have had its true parental\r\ncauses: spontaneity is only a term for man\'s ignorance of the gods.\r\n\r\n"Is there, then, no spontaneity on the part of those who drive the\r\ndriver?"\r\n\r\nHere followed an obscure argument upon this subject, which I have thought\r\nit best to omit.  The writer resumes:--"After all then it comes to this,\r\nthat the difference between the life of a man and that of a machine is\r\none rather of degree than of kind, though differences in kind are not\r\nwanting.  An animal has more provision for emergency than a machine.  The\r\nmachine is less versatile; its range of action is narrow; its strength\r\nand accuracy in its own sphere are superhuman, but it shows badly in a\r\ndilemma; sometimes when its normal action is disturbed, it will lose its\r\nhead, and go from bad to worse like a lunatic in a raging frenzy: but\r\nhere, again, we are met by the same consideration as before, namely, that\r\nthe machines are still in their infancy; they are mere skeletons without\r\nmuscles and flesh.\r\n\r\n"For how many emergencies is an oyster adapted?  For as many as are\r\nlikely to happen to it, and no more.  So are the machines; and so is man\r\nhimself.  The list of casualties that daily occur to man through his want\r\nof adaptability is probably as great as that occurring to the machines;\r\nand every day gives them some greater provision for the unforeseen.  Let\r\nany one examine the wonderful self-regulating and self-adjusting\r\ncontrivances which are now incorporated with the vapour-engine, let him\r\nwatch the way in which it supplies itself with oil; in which it indicates\r\nits wants to those who tend it; in which, by the governor, it regulates\r\nits application of its own strength; let him look at that store-house of\r\ninertia and momentum the fly-wheel, or at the buffers on a railway\r\ncarriage; let him see how those improvements are being selected for\r\nperpetuity which contain provision against the emergencies that may arise\r\nto harass the machines, and then let him think of a hundred thousand\r\nyears, and the accumulated progress which they will bring unless man can\r\nbe awakened to a sense of his situation, and of the doom which he is\r\npreparing for himself. {6}\r\n\r\n"The misery is that man has been blind so long already.  In his reliance\r\nupon the use of steam he has been betrayed into increasing and\r\nmultiplying.  To withdraw steam power suddenly will not have the effect\r\nof reducing us to the state in which we were before its introduction;\r\nthere will be a general break-up and time of anarchy such as has never\r\nbeen known; it will be as though our population were suddenly doubled,\r\nwith no additional means of feeding the increased number.  The air we\r\nbreathe is hardly more necessary for our animal life than the use of any\r\nmachine, on the strength of which we have increased our numbers, is to\r\nour civilisation; it is the machines which act upon man and make him man,\r\nas much as man who has acted upon and made the machines; but we must\r\nchoose between the alternative of undergoing much present suffering, or\r\nseeing ourselves gradually superseded by our own creatures, till we rank\r\nno higher in comparison with them, than the beasts of the field with\r\nourselves.\r\n\r\n"Herein lies our danger.  For many seem inclined to acquiesce in so\r\ndishonourable a future.  They say that although man should become to the\r\nmachines what the horse and dog are to us, yet that he will continue to\r\nexist, and will probably be better off in a state of domestication under\r\nthe beneficent rule of the machines than in his present wild condition.\r\nWe treat our domestic animals with much kindness.  We give them whatever\r\nwe believe to be the best for them; and there can be no doubt that our\r\nuse of meat has increased their happiness rather than detracted from it.\r\nIn like manner there is reason to hope that the machines will use us\r\nkindly, for their existence will be in a great measure dependent upon\r\nours; they will rule us with a rod of iron, but they will not eat us;\r\nthey will not only require our services in the reproduction and education\r\nof their young, but also in waiting upon them as servants; in gathering\r\nfood for them, and feeding them; in restoring them to health when they\r\nare sick; and in either burying their dead or working up their deceased\r\nmembers into new forms of mechanical existence.\r\n\r\n"The very nature of the motive power which works the advancement of the\r\nmachines precludes the possibility of man\'s life being rendered miserable\r\nas well as enslaved.  Slaves are tolerably happy if they have good\r\nmasters, and the revolution will not occur in our time, nor hardly in ten\r\nthousand years, or ten times that.  Is it wise to be uneasy about a\r\ncontingency which is so remote?  Man is not a sentimental animal where\r\nhis material interests are concerned, and though here and there some\r\nardent soul may look upon himself and curse his fate that he was not born\r\na vapour-engine, yet the mass of mankind will acquiesce in any\r\narrangement which gives them better food and clothing at a cheaper rate,\r\nand will refrain from yielding to unreasonable jealousy merely because\r\nthere are other destinies more glorious than their own.\r\n\r\n"The power of custom is enormous, and so gradual will be the change, that\r\nman\'s sense of what is due to himself will be at no time rudely shocked;\r\nour bondage will steal upon us noiselessly and by imperceptible\r\napproaches; nor will there ever be such a clashing of desires between man\r\nand the machines as will lead to an encounter between them.  Among\r\nthemselves the machines will war eternally, but they will still require\r\nman as the being through whose agency the struggle will be principally\r\nconducted.  In point of fact there is no occasion for anxiety about the\r\nfuture happiness of man so long as he continues to be in any way\r\nprofitable to the machines; he may become the inferior race, but he will\r\nbe infinitely better off than he is now.  Is it not then both absurd and\r\nunreasonable to be envious of our benefactors?  And should we not be\r\nguilty of consummate folly if we were to reject advantages which we\r\ncannot obtain otherwise, merely because they involve a greater gain to\r\nothers than to ourselves?\r\n\r\n"With those who can argue in this way I have nothing in common.  I shrink\r\nwith as much horror from believing that my race can ever be superseded or\r\nsurpassed, as I should do from believing that even at the remotest period\r\nmy ancestors were other than human beings.  Could I believe that ten\r\nhundred thousand years ago a single one of my ancestors was another kind\r\nof being to myself, I should lose all self-respect, and take no further\r\npleasure or interest in life.  I have the same feeling with regard to my\r\ndescendants, and believe it to be one that will be felt so generally that\r\nthe country will resolve upon putting an immediate stop to all further\r\nmechanical progress, and upon destroying all improvements that have been\r\nmade for the last three hundred years.  I would not urge more than this.\r\nWe may trust ourselves to deal with those that remain, and though I\r\nshould prefer to have seen the destruction include another two hundred\r\nyears, I am aware of the necessity for compromising, and would so far\r\nsacrifice my own individual convictions as to be content with three\r\nhundred.  Less than this will be insufficient."\r\n\r\nThis was the conclusion of the attack which led to the destruction of\r\nmachinery throughout Erewhon.  There was only one serious attempt to\r\nanswer it.  Its author said that machines were to be regarded as a part\r\nof man\'s own physical nature, being really nothing but extra-corporeal\r\nlimbs.  Man, he said, was a machinate mammal.  The lower animals keep all\r\ntheir limbs at home in their own bodies, but many of man\'s are loose, and\r\nlie about detached, now here and now there, in various parts of the\r\nworld--some being kept always handy for contingent use, and others being\r\noccasionally hundreds of miles away.  A machine is merely a supplementary\r\nlimb; this is the be all and end all of machinery.  We do not use our own\r\nlimbs other than as machines; and a leg is only a much better wooden leg\r\nthan any one can manufacture.\r\n\r\n"Observe a man digging with a spade; his right fore-arm has become\r\nartificially lengthened, and his hand has become a joint.  The handle of\r\nthe spade is like the knob at the end of the humerus; the shaft is the\r\nadditional bone, and the oblong iron plate is the new form of the hand\r\nwhich enables its possessor to disturb the earth in a way to which his\r\noriginal hand was unequal.  Having thus modified himself, not as other\r\nanimals are modified, by circumstances over which they have had not even\r\nthe appearance of control, but having, as it were, taken forethought and\r\nadded a cubit to his stature, civilisation began to dawn upon the race,\r\nthe social good offices, the genial companionship of friends, the art of\r\nunreason, and all those habits of mind which most elevate man above the\r\nlower animals, in the course of time ensued.\r\n\r\n"Thus civilisation and mechanical progress advanced hand in hand, each\r\ndeveloping and being developed by the other, the earliest accidental use\r\nof the stick having set the ball rolling, and the prospect of advantage\r\nkeeping it in motion.  In fact, machines are to be regarded as the mode\r\nof development by which human organism is now especially advancing, every\r\npast invention being an addition to the resources of the human body.  Even\r\ncommunity of limbs is thus rendered possible to those who have so much\r\ncommunity of soul as to own money enough to pay a railway fare; for a\r\ntrain is only a seven-leagued foot that five hundred may own at once."\r\n\r\nThe one serious danger which this writer apprehended was that the\r\nmachines would so equalise men\'s powers, and so lessen the severity of\r\ncompetition, that many persons of inferior physique would escape\r\ndetection and transmit their inferiority to their descendants.  He feared\r\nthat the removal of the present pressure might cause a degeneracy of the\r\nhuman race, and indeed that the whole body might become purely\r\nrudimentary, the man himself being nothing but soul and mechanism, an\r\nintelligent but passionless principle of mechanical action.\r\n\r\n"How greatly," he wrote, "do we not now live with our external limbs?  We\r\nvary our physique with the seasons, with age, with advancing or\r\ndecreasing wealth.  If it is wet we are furnished with an organ commonly\r\ncalled an umbrella, and which is designed for the purpose of protecting\r\nour clothes or our skins from the injurious effects of rain.  Man has now\r\nmany extra-corporeal members, which are of more importance to him than a\r\ngood deal of his hair, or at any rate than his whiskers.  His memory goes\r\nin his pocket-book.  He becomes more and more complex as he grows older;\r\nhe will then be seen with see-engines, or perhaps with artificial teeth\r\nand hair: if he be a really well-developed specimen of his race, he will\r\nbe furnished with a large box upon wheels, two horses, and a coachman."\r\n\r\nIt was this writer who originated the custom of classifying men by their\r\nhorse-power, and who divided them into genera, species, varieties, and\r\nsubvarieties, giving them names from the hypothetical language which\r\nexpressed the number of limbs which they could command at any moment.  He\r\nshowed that men became more highly and delicately organised the more\r\nnearly they approached the summit of opulence, and that none but\r\nmillionaires possessed the full complement of limbs with which mankind\r\ncould become incorporate.\r\n\r\n"Those mighty organisms," he continued, "our leading bankers and\r\nmerchants, speak to their congeners through the length and breadth of the\r\nland in a second of time; their rich and subtle souls can defy all\r\nmaterial impediment, whereas the souls of the poor are clogged and\r\nhampered by matter, which sticks fast about them as treacle to the wings\r\nof a fly, or as one struggling in a quicksand: their dull ears must take\r\ndays or weeks to hear what another would tell them from a distance,\r\ninstead of hearing it in a second as is done by the more highly organised\r\nclasses.  Who shall deny that one who can tack on a special train to his\r\nidentity, and go wheresoever he will whensoever he pleases, is more\r\nhighly organised than he who, should he wish for the same power, might\r\nwish for the wings of a bird with an equal chance of getting them; and\r\nwhose legs are his only means of locomotion?  That old philosophic enemy,\r\nmatter, the inherently and essentially evil, still hangs about the neck\r\nof the poor and strangles him: but to the rich, matter is immaterial; the\r\nelaborate organisation of his extra-corporeal system has freed his soul.\r\n\r\n"This is the secret of the homage which we see rich men receive from\r\nthose who are poorer than themselves: it would be a grave error to\r\nsuppose that this deference proceeds from motives which we need be\r\nashamed of: it is the natural respect which all living creatures pay to\r\nthose whom they recognise as higher than themselves in the scale of\r\nanimal life, and is analogous to the veneration which a dog feels for\r\nman.  Among savage races it is deemed highly honourable to be the\r\npossessor of a gun, and throughout all known time there has been a\r\nfeeling that those who are worth most are the worthiest."\r\n\r\nAnd so he went on at considerable length, attempting to show what changes\r\nin the distribution of animal and vegetable life throughout the kingdom\r\nhad been caused by this and that of man\'s inventions, and in what way\r\neach was connected with the moral and intellectual development of the\r\nhuman species: he even allotted to some the share which they had had in\r\nthe creation and modification of man\'s body, and that which they would\r\nhereafter have in its destruction; but the other writer was considered to\r\nhave the best of it, and in the end succeeded in destroying all the\r\ninventions that had been discovered for the preceding 271 years, a period\r\nwhich was agreed upon by all parties after several years of wrangling as\r\nto whether a certain kind of mangle which was much in use among\r\nwasherwomen should be saved or no.  It was at last ruled to be dangerous,\r\nand was just excluded by the limit of 271 years.  Then came the\r\nreactionary civil wars which nearly ruined the country, but which it\r\nwould be beyond my present scope to describe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI: THE VIEWS OF AN EREWHONIAN PROPHET CONCERNING THE RIGHTS OF\r\nANIMALS\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from the foregoing chapters that the Erewhonians are a\r\nmeek and long-suffering people, easily led by the nose, and quick to\r\noffer up common sense at the shrine of logic, when a philosopher arises\r\namong them, who carries them away through his reputation for especial\r\nlearning, or by convincing them that their existing institutions are not\r\nbased on the strictest principles of morality.\r\n\r\nThe series of revolutions on which I shall now briefly touch shows this\r\neven more plainly than the way (already dealt with) in which at a later\r\ndate they cut their throats in the matter of machinery; for if the second\r\nof the two reformers of whom I am about to speak had had his way--or\r\nrather the way that he professed to have--the whole race would have died\r\nof starvation within a twelve-month.  Happily common sense, though she is\r\nby nature the gentlest creature living, when she feels the knife at her\r\nthroat, is apt to develop unexpected powers of resistance, and to send\r\ndoctrinaires flying, even when they have bound her down and think they\r\nhave her at their mercy.  What happened, so far as I could collect it\r\nfrom the best authorities, was as follows:-\r\n\r\nSome two thousand five hundred years ago the Erewhonians were still\r\nuncivilised, and lived by hunting, fishing, a rude system of agriculture,\r\nand plundering such few other nations as they had not yet completely\r\nconquered.  They had no schools or systems of philosophy, but by a kind\r\nof dog-knowledge did that which was right in their own eyes and in those\r\nof their neighbours; the common sense, therefore, of the public being as\r\nyet unvitiated, crime and disease were looked upon much as they are in\r\nother countries.\r\n\r\nBut with the gradual advance of civilisation and increase in material\r\nprosperity, people began to ask questions about things that they had\r\nhitherto taken as matters of course, and one old gentleman, who had great\r\ninfluence over them by reason of the sanctity of his life, and his\r\nsupposed inspiration by an unseen power, whose existence was now\r\nbeginning to be felt, took it into his head to disquiet himself about the\r\nrights of animals--a question that so far had disturbed nobody.\r\n\r\nAll prophets are more or less fussy, and this old gentleman seems to have\r\nbeen one of the more fussy ones.  Being maintained at the public expense,\r\nhe had ample leisure, and not content with limiting his attention to the\r\nrights of animals, he wanted to reduce right and wrong to rules, to\r\nconsider the foundations of duty and of good and evil, and otherwise to\r\nput all sorts of matters on a logical basis, which people whose time is\r\nmoney are content to accept on no basis at all.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of course, the basis on which he decided that duty could\r\nalone rest was one that afforded no standing-room for many of the old-\r\nestablished habits of the people.  These, he assured them, were all\r\nwrong, and whenever any one ventured to differ from him, he referred the\r\nmatter to the unseen power with which he alone was in direct\r\ncommunication, and the unseen power invariably assured him that he was\r\nright.  As regards the rights of animals he taught as follows:-\r\n\r\n"You know," he said, "how wicked it is of you to kill one another.  Once\r\nupon a time your fore-fathers made no scruple about not only killing, but\r\nalso eating their relations.  No one would now go back to such detestable\r\npractices, for it is notorious that we have lived much more happily since\r\nthey were abandoned.  From this increased prosperity we may confidently\r\ndeduce the maxim that we should not kill and eat our fellow-creatures.  I\r\nhave consulted the higher power by whom you know that I am inspired, and\r\nhe has assured me that this conclusion is irrefragable.\r\n\r\n"Now it cannot be denied that sheep, cattle, deer, birds, and fishes are\r\nour fellow-creatures.  They differ from us in some respects, but those in\r\nwhich they differ are few and secondary, while those that they have in\r\ncommon with us are many and essential.  My friends, if it was wrong of\r\nyou to kill and eat your fellow-men, it is wrong also to kill and eat\r\nfish, flesh, and fowl.  Birds, beasts, and fishes, have as full a right\r\nto live as long as they can unmolested by man, as man has to live\r\nunmolested by his neighbours.  These words, let me again assure you, are\r\nnot mine, but those of the higher power which inspires me.\r\n\r\n"I grant," he continued, "that animals molest one another, and that some\r\nof them go so far as to molest man, but I have yet to learn that we\r\nshould model our conduct on that of the lower animals.  We should\r\nendeavour, rather, to instruct them, and bring them to a better mind.  To\r\nkill a tiger, for example, who has lived on the flesh of men and women\r\nwhom he has killed, is to reduce ourselves to the level of the tiger, and\r\nis unworthy of people who seek to be guided by the highest principles in\r\nall, both their thoughts and actions.\r\n\r\n"The unseen power who has revealed himself to me alone among you, has\r\ntold me to tell you that you ought by this time to have outgrown the\r\nbarbarous habits of your ancestors.  If, as you believe, you know better\r\nthan they, you should do better.  He commands you, therefore, to refrain\r\nfrom killing any living being for the sake of eating it.  The only animal\r\nfood that you may eat, is the flesh of any birds, beasts, or fishes that\r\nyou may come upon as having died a natural death, or any that may have\r\nbeen born prematurely, or so deformed that it is a mercy to put them out\r\nof their pain; you may also eat all such animals as have committed\r\nsuicide.  As regards vegetables you may eat all those that will let you\r\neat them with impunity."\r\n\r\nSo wisely and so well did the old prophet argue, and so terrible were the\r\nthreats he hurled at those who should disobey him, that in the end he\r\ncarried the more highly educated part of the people with him, and\r\npresently the poorer classes followed suit, or professed to do so.  Having\r\nseen the triumph of his principles, he was gathered to his fathers, and\r\nno doubt entered at once into full communion with that unseen power whose\r\nfavour he had already so pre-eminently enjoyed.\r\n\r\nHe had not, however, been dead very long, before some of his more ardent\r\ndisciples took it upon them to better the instruction of their master.\r\nThe old prophet had allowed the use of eggs and milk, but his disciples\r\ndecided that to eat a fresh egg was to destroy a potential chicken, and\r\nthat this came to much the same as murdering a live one.  Stale eggs, if\r\nit was quite certain that they were too far gone to be able to be\r\nhatched, were grudgingly permitted, but all eggs offered for sale had to\r\nbe submitted to an inspector, who, on being satisfied that they were\r\naddled, would label them "Laid not less than three months" from the date,\r\nwhatever it might happen to be.  These eggs, I need hardly say, were only\r\nused in puddings, and as a medicine in certain cases where an emetic was\r\nurgently required.  Milk was forbidden inasmuch as it could not be\r\nobtained without robbing some calf of its natural sustenance, and thus\r\nendangering its life.\r\n\r\nIt will be easily believed that at first there were many who gave the new\r\nrules outward observance, but embraced every opportunity of indulging\r\nsecretly in those flesh-pots to which they had been accustomed.  It was\r\nfound that animals were continually dying natural deaths under more or\r\nless suspicious circumstances.  Suicidal mania, again, which had hitherto\r\nbeen confined exclusively to donkeys, became alarmingly prevalent even\r\namong such for the most part self-respecting creatures as sheep and\r\ncattle.  It was astonishing how some of these unfortunate animals would\r\nscent out a butcher\'s knife if there was one within a mile of them, and\r\nrun right up against it if the butcher did not get it out of their way in\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nDogs, again, that had been quite law-abiding as regards domestic poultry,\r\ntame rabbits, sucking pigs, or sheep and lambs, suddenly took to breaking\r\nbeyond the control of their masters, and killing anything that they were\r\ntold not to touch.  It was held that any animal killed by a dog had died\r\na natural death, for it was the dog\'s nature to kill things, and he had\r\nonly refrained from molesting farmyard creatures hitherto because his\r\nnature had been tampered with.  Unfortunately the more these unruly\r\ntendencies became developed, the more the common people seemed to delight\r\nin breeding the very animals that would put temptation in the dog\'s way.\r\nThere is little doubt, in fact, that they were deliberately evading the\r\nlaw; but whether this was so or no they sold or ate everything their dogs\r\nhad killed.\r\n\r\nEvasion was more difficult in the case of the larger animals, for the\r\nmagistrates could not wink at all the pretended suicides of pigs, sheep,\r\nand cattle that were brought before them.  Sometimes they had to convict,\r\nand a few convictions had a very terrorising effect--whereas in the case\r\nof animals killed by a dog, the marks of the dog\'s teeth could be seen,\r\nand it was practically impossible to prove malice on the part of the\r\nowner of the dog.\r\n\r\nAnother fertile source of disobedience to the law was furnished by a\r\ndecision of one of the judges that raised a great outcry among the more\r\nfervent disciples of the old prophet.  The judge held that it was lawful\r\nto kill any animal in self-defence, and that such conduct was so natural\r\non the part of a man who found himself attacked, that the attacking\r\ncreature should be held to have died a natural death.  The High\r\nVegetarians had indeed good reason to be alarmed, for hardly had this\r\ndecision become generally known before a number of animals, hitherto\r\nharmless, took to attacking their owners with such ferocity, that it\r\nbecame necessary to put them to a natural death.  Again, it was quite\r\ncommon at that time to see the carcase of a calf, lamb, or kid exposed\r\nfor sale with a label from the inspector certifying that it had been\r\nkilled in self-defence.  Sometimes even the carcase of a lamb or calf was\r\nexposed as "warranted still-born," when it presented every appearance of\r\nhaving enjoyed at least a month of life.\r\n\r\nAs for the flesh of animals that had _bona fide_ died a natural death,\r\nthe permission to eat it was nugatory, for it was generally eaten by some\r\nother animal before man got hold of it; or failing this it was often\r\npoisonous, so that practically people were forced to evade the law by\r\nsome of the means above spoken of, or to become vegetarians.  This last\r\nalternative was so little to the taste of the Erewhonians, that the laws\r\nagainst killing animals were falling into desuetude, and would very\r\nlikely have been repealed, but for the breaking out of a pestilence,\r\nwhich was ascribed by the priests and prophets of the day to the\r\nlawlessness of the people in the matter of eating forbidden flesh.  On\r\nthis, there was a reaction; stringent laws were passed, forbidding the\r\nuse of meat in any form or shape, and permitting no food but grain,\r\nfruits, and vegetables to be sold in shops and markets.  These laws were\r\nenacted about two hundred years after the death of the old prophet who\r\nhad first unsettled people\'s minds about the rights of animals; but they\r\nhad hardly been passed before people again began to break them.\r\n\r\nI was told that the most painful consequence of all this folly did not\r\nlie in the fact that law-abiding people had to go without animal\r\nfood--many nations do this and seem none the worse, and even in flesh-\r\neating countries such as Italy, Spain, and Greece, the poor seldom see\r\nmeat from year\'s end to year\'s end.  The mischief lay in the jar which\r\nundue prohibition gave to the consciences of all but those who were\r\nstrong enough to know that though conscience as a rule boons, it can also\r\nbane.  The awakened conscience of an individual will often lead him to do\r\nthings in haste that he had better have left undone, but the conscience\r\nof a nation awakened by a respectable old gentleman who has an unseen\r\npower up his sleeve will pave hell with a vengeance.\r\n\r\nYoung people were told that it was a sin to do what their fathers had\r\ndone unhurt for centuries; those, moreover, who preached to them about\r\nthe enormity of eating meat, were an unattractive academic folk, and\r\nthough they over-awed all but the bolder youths, there were few who did\r\nnot in their hearts dislike them.  However much the young person might be\r\nshielded, he soon got to know that men and women of the world--often far\r\nnicer people than the prophets who preached abstention--continually spoke\r\nsneeringly of the new doctrinaire laws, and were believed to set them\r\naside in secret, though they dared not do so openly.  Small wonder, then,\r\nthat the more human among the student classes were provoked by the touch-\r\nnot, taste-not, handle-not precepts of their rulers, into questioning\r\nmuch that they would otherwise have unhesitatingly accepted.\r\n\r\nOne sad story is on record about a young man of promising amiable\r\ndisposition, but cursed with more conscience than brains, who had been\r\ntold by his doctor (for as I have above said disease was not yet held to\r\nbe criminal) that he ought to eat meat, law or no law.  He was much\r\nshocked and for some time refused to comply with what he deemed the\r\nunrighteous advice given him by his doctor; at last, however, finding\r\nthat he grew weaker and weaker, he stole secretly on a dark night into\r\none of those dens in which meat was surreptitiously sold, and bought a\r\npound of prime steak.  He took it home, cooked it in his bedroom when\r\nevery one in the house had gone to rest, ate it, and though he could\r\nhardly sleep for remorse and shame, felt so much better next morning that\r\nhe hardly knew himself.\r\n\r\nThree or four days later, he again found himself irresistibly drawn to\r\nthis same den.  Again he bought a pound of steak, again he cooked and ate\r\nit, and again, in spite of much mental torture, on the following morning\r\nfelt himself a different man.  To cut the story short, though he never\r\nwent beyond the bounds of moderation, it preyed upon his mind that he\r\nshould be drifting, as he certainly was, into the ranks of the habitual\r\nlaw-breakers.\r\n\r\nAll the time his health kept on improving, and though he felt sure that\r\nhe owed this to the beefsteaks, the better he became in body, the more\r\nhis conscience gave him no rest; two voices were for ever ringing in his\r\nears--the one saying, "I am Common Sense and Nature; heed me, and I will\r\nreward you as I rewarded your fathers before you."  But the other voice\r\nsaid: "Let not that plausible spirit lure you to your ruin.  I am Duty;\r\nheed me, and I will reward you as I rewarded your fathers before you."\r\n\r\nSometimes he even seemed to see the faces of the speakers.  Common Sense\r\nlooked so easy, genial, and serene, so frank and fearless, that do what\r\nhe might he could not mistrust her; but as he was on the point of\r\nfollowing her, he would be checked by the austere face of Duty, so grave,\r\nbut yet so kindly; and it cut him to the heart that from time to time he\r\nshould see her turn pitying away from him as he followed after her rival.\r\n\r\nThe poor boy continually thought of the better class of his\r\nfellow-students, and tried to model his conduct on what he thought was\r\ntheirs.  "They," he said to himself, "eat a beefsteak?  Never."  But they\r\nmost of them ate one now and again, unless it was a mutton chop that\r\ntempted them.  And they used him for a model much as he did them.  "He,"\r\nthey would say to themselves, "eat a mutton chop?  Never."  One night,\r\nhowever, he was followed by one of the authorities, who was always\r\nprowling about in search of law-breakers, and was caught coming out of\r\nthe den with half a shoulder of mutton concealed about his person.  On\r\nthis, even though he had not been put in prison, he would have been sent\r\naway with his prospects in life irretrievably ruined; he therefore hanged\r\nhimself as soon as he got home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII: THE VIEWS OF AN EREWHONIAN PHILOSOPHER CONCERNING THE\r\nRIGHTS OF VEGETABLES\r\n\r\n\r\nLet me leave this unhappy story, and return to the course of events among\r\nthe Erewhonians at large.  No matter how many laws they passed increasing\r\nthe severity of the punishments inflicted on those who ate meat in\r\nsecret, the people found means of setting them aside as fast as they were\r\nmade.  At times, indeed, they would become almost obsolete, but when they\r\nwere on the point of being repealed, some national disaster or the\r\npreaching of some fanatic would reawaken the conscience of the nation,\r\nand people were imprisoned by the thousand for illicitly selling and\r\nbuying animal food.\r\n\r\nAbout six or seven hundred years, however, after the death of the old\r\nprophet, a philosopher appeared, who, though he did not claim to have any\r\ncommunication with an unseen power, laid down the law with as much\r\nconfidence as if such a power had inspired him.  Many think that this\r\nphilosopher did not believe his own teaching, and, being in secret a\r\ngreat meat-eater, had no other end in view than reducing the prohibition\r\nagainst eating animal food to an absurdity, greater even than an\r\nErewhonian Puritan would be able to stand.\r\n\r\nThose who take this view hold that he knew how impossible it would be to\r\nget the nation to accept legislation that it held to be sinful; he knew\r\nalso how hopeless it would be to convince people that it was not wicked\r\nto kill a sheep and eat it, unless he could show them that they must\r\neither sin to a certain extent, or die.  He, therefore, it is believed,\r\nmade the monstrous proposals of which I will now speak.\r\n\r\nHe began by paying a tribute of profound respect to the old prophet,\r\nwhose advocacy of the rights of animals, he admitted, had done much to\r\nsoften the national character, and enlarge its views about the sanctity\r\nof life in general.  But he urged that times had now changed; the lesson\r\nof which the country had stood in need had been sufficiently learnt,\r\nwhile as regards vegetables much had become known that was not even\r\nsuspected formerly, and which, if the nation was to persevere in that\r\nstrict adherence to the highest moral principles which had been the\r\nsecret of its prosperity hitherto, must necessitate a radical change in\r\nits attitude towards them.\r\n\r\nIt was indeed true that much was now known that had not been suspected\r\nformerly, for the people had had no foreign enemies, and, being both\r\nquick-witted and inquisitive into the mysteries of nature, had made\r\nextraordinary progress in all the many branches of art and science.  In\r\nthe chief Erewhonian museum I was shown a microscope of considerable\r\npower, that was ascribed by the authorities to a date much about that of\r\nthe philosopher of whom I am now speaking, and was even supposed by some\r\nto have been the instrument with which he had actually worked.\r\n\r\nThis philosopher was Professor of botany in the chief seat of learning\r\nthen in Erewhon, and whether with the help of the microscope still\r\npreserved, or with another, had arrived at a conclusion now universally\r\naccepted among ourselves--I mean, that all, both animals and plants, have\r\nhad a common ancestry, and that hence the second should be deemed as much\r\nalive as the first.  He contended, therefore, that animals and plants\r\nwere cousins, and would have been seen to be so, all along, if people had\r\nnot made an arbitrary and unreasonable division between what they chose\r\nto call the animal and vegetable kingdoms.\r\n\r\nHe declared, and demonstrated to the satisfaction of all those who were\r\nable to form an opinion upon the subject, that there is no difference\r\nappreciable either by the eye, or by any other test, between a germ that\r\nwill develop into an oak, a vine, a rose, and one that (given its\r\naccustomed surroundings) will become a mouse, an elephant, or a man.\r\n\r\nHe contended that the course of any germ\'s development was dictated by\r\nthe habits of the germs from which it was descended and of whose identity\r\nit had once formed part.  If a germ found itself placed as the germs in\r\nthe line of its ancestry were placed, it would do as its ancestors had\r\ndone, and grow up into the same kind of organism as theirs.  If it found\r\nthe circumstances only a little different, it would make shift\r\n(successfully or unsuccessfully) to modify its development accordingly;\r\nif the circumstances were widely different, it would die, probably\r\nwithout an effort at self-adaptation.  This, he argued, applied equally\r\nto the germs of plants and of animals.\r\n\r\nHe therefore connected all, both animal and vegetable development, with\r\nintelligence, either spent and now unconscious, or still unspent and\r\nconscious; and in support of his view as regards vegetable life, he\r\npointed to the way in which all plants have adapted themselves to their\r\nhabitual environment.  Granting that vegetable intelligence at first\r\nsight appears to differ materially from animal, yet, he urged, it is like\r\nit in the one essential fact that though it has evidently busied itself\r\nabout matters that are vital to the well-being of the organism that\r\npossesses it, it has never shown the slightest tendency to occupy itself\r\nwith anything else.  This, he insisted, is as great a proof of\r\nintelligence as any living being can give.\r\n\r\n"Plants," said he, "show no sign of interesting themselves in human\r\naffairs.  We shall never get a rose to understand that five times seven\r\nare thirty-five, and there is no use in talking to an oak about\r\nfluctuations in the price of stocks.  Hence we say that the oak and the\r\nrose are unintelligent, and on finding that they do not understand our\r\nbusiness conclude that they do not understand their own.  But what can a\r\ncreature who talks in this way know about intelligence?  Which shows\r\ngreater signs of intelligence?  He, or the rose and oak?\r\n\r\n"And when we call plants stupid for not understanding our business, how\r\ncapable do we show ourselves of understanding theirs?  Can we form even\r\nthe faintest conception of the way in which a seed from a rose-tree turns\r\nearth, air, warmth and water into a rose full-blown?  Where does it get\r\nits colour from?  From the earth, air, &c.?  Yes--but how?  Those petals\r\nof such ineffable texture--that hue that outvies the cheek of a\r\nchild--that scent again?  Look at earth, air, and water--these are all\r\nthe raw material that the rose has got to work with; does it show any\r\nsign of want of intelligence in the alchemy with which it turns mud into\r\nrose-leaves?  What chemist can do anything comparable?  Why does no one\r\ntry?  Simply because every one knows that no human intelligence is equal\r\nto the task.  We give it up.  It is the rose\'s department; let the rose\r\nattend to it--and be dubbed unintelligent because it baffles us by the\r\nmiracles it works, and the unconcerned business-like way in which it\r\nworks them.\r\n\r\n"See what pains, again, plants take to protect themselves against their\r\nenemies.  They scratch, cut, sting, make bad smells, secrete the most\r\ndreadful poisons (which Heaven only knows how they contrive to make),\r\ncover their precious seeds with spines like those of a hedgehog, frighten\r\ninsects with delicate nervous systems by assuming portentous shapes, hide\r\nthemselves, grow in inaccessible places, and tell lies so plausibly as to\r\ndeceive even their subtlest foes.\r\n\r\n"They lay traps smeared with bird-lime, to catch insects, and persuade\r\nthem to drown themselves in pitchers which they have made of their\r\nleaves, and fill with water; others make themselves, as it were, into\r\nliving rat-traps, which close with a spring on any insect that settles\r\nupon them; others make their flowers into the shape of a certain fly that\r\nis a great pillager of honey, so that when the real fly comes it thinks\r\nthat the flowers are bespoke, and goes on elsewhere.  Some are so clever\r\nas even to overreach themselves, like the horse-radish, which gets pulled\r\nup and eaten for the sake of that pungency with which it protects itself\r\nagainst underground enemies.  If, on the other hand, they think that any\r\ninsect can be of service to them, see how pretty they make themselves.\r\n\r\n"What is to be intelligent if to know how to do what one wants to do, and\r\nto do it repeatedly, is not to be intelligent?  Some say that the rose-\r\nseed does not want to grow into a rose-bush.  Why, then, in the name of\r\nall that is reasonable, does it grow?  Likely enough it is unaware of the\r\nwant that is spurring it on to action.  We have no reason to suppose that\r\na human embryo knows that it wants to grow into a baby, or a baby into a\r\nman.  Nothing ever shows signs of knowing what it is either wanting or\r\ndoing, when its convictions both as to what it wants, and how to get it,\r\nhave been settled beyond further power of question.  The less signs\r\nliving creatures give of knowing what they do, provided they do it, and\r\ndo it repeatedly and well, the greater proof they give that in reality\r\nthey know how to do it, and have done it already on an infinite number of\r\npast occasions.\r\n\r\n"Some one may say," he continued, "\'What do you mean by talking about an\r\ninfinite number of past occasions?  When did a rose-seed make itself into\r\na rose-bush on any past occasion?\'\r\n\r\n"I answer this question with another.  \'Did the rose-seed ever form part\r\nof the identity of the rose-bush on which it grew?\'  Who can say that it\r\ndid not?  Again I ask: \'Was this rose-bush ever linked by all those links\r\nthat we commonly consider as constituting personal identity, with the\r\nseed from which it in its turn grew?\'  Who can say that it was not?\r\n\r\n"Then, if rose-seed number two is a continuation of the personality of\r\nits parent rose-bush, and if that rose-bush is a continuation of the\r\npersonality of the rose-seed from which it sprang, rose-seed number two\r\nmust also be a continuation of the personality of the earlier rose-seed.\r\nAnd this rose-seed must be a continuation of the personality of the\r\npreceding rose-seed--and so back and back _ad infinitum_.  Hence it is\r\nimpossible to deny continued personality between any existing rose-seed\r\nand the earliest seed that can be called a rose-seed at all.\r\n\r\n"The answer, then, to our objector is not far to seek.  The rose-seed did\r\nwhat it now does in the persons of its ancestors--to whom it has been so\r\nlinked as to be able to remember what those ancestors did when they were\r\nplaced as the rose-seed now is.  Each stage of development brings back\r\nthe recollection of the course taken in the preceding stage, and the\r\ndevelopment has been so often repeated, that all doubt--and with all\r\ndoubt, all consciousness of action--is suspended.\r\n\r\n"But an objector may still say, \'Granted that the linking between all\r\nsuccessive generations has been so close and unbroken, that each one of\r\nthem may be conceived as able to remember what it did in the persons of\r\nits ancestors--how do you show that it actually did remember?\'\r\n\r\n"The answer is: \'By the action which each generation takes--an action\r\nwhich repeats all the phenomena that we commonly associate with\r\nmemory--which is explicable on the supposition that it has been guided by\r\nmemory--and which has neither been explained, nor seems ever likely to be\r\nexplained on any other theory than the supposition that there is an\r\nabiding memory between successive generations.\'\r\n\r\n"Will any one bring an example of any living creature whose action we can\r\nunderstand, performing an ineffably difficult and intricate action, time\r\nafter time, with invariable success, and yet not knowing how to do it,\r\nand never having done it before?  Show me the example and I will say no\r\nmore, but until it is shown me, I shall credit action where I cannot\r\nwatch it, with being controlled by the same laws as when it is within our\r\nken.  It will become unconscious as soon as the skill that directs it has\r\nbecome perfected.  Neither rose-seed, therefore, nor embryo should be\r\nexpected to show signs of knowing that they know what they know--if they\r\nshowed such signs the fact of their knowing what they want, and how to\r\nget it, might more reasonably be doubted."\r\n\r\nSome of the passages already given in Chapter XXIII were obviously\r\ninspired by the one just quoted.  As I read it, in a reprint shown me by\r\na Professor who had edited much of the early literature on the subject, I\r\ncould not but remember the one in which our Lord tells His disciples to\r\nconsider the lilies of the field, who neither toil nor spin, but whose\r\nraiment surpasses even that of Solomon in all his glory.\r\n\r\n"They toil not, neither do they spin?"  Is that so?  "Toil not?"  Perhaps\r\nnot, now that the method of procedure is so well known as to admit of no\r\nfurther question--but it is not likely that lilies came to make\r\nthemselves so beautifully without having ever taken any pains about the\r\nmatter.  "Neither do they spin?"  Not with a spinning-wheel; but is there\r\nno textile fabric in a leaf?\r\n\r\nWhat would the lilies of the field say if they heard one of us declaring\r\nthat they neither toil nor spin?  They would say, I take it, much what we\r\nshould if we were to hear of their preaching humility on the text of\r\nSolomons, and saying, "Consider the Solomons in all their glory, they\r\ntoil not neither do they spin."  We should say that the lilies were\r\ntalking about things that they did not understand, and that though the\r\nSolomons do not toil nor spin, yet there had been no lack of either\r\ntoiling or spinning before they came to be arrayed so gorgeously.\r\n\r\nLet me now return to the Professor.  I have said enough to show the\r\ngeneral drift of the arguments on which he relied in order to show that\r\nvegetables are only animals under another name, but have not stated his\r\ncase in anything like the fullness with which he laid it before the\r\npublic.  The conclusion he drew, or pretended to draw, was that if it was\r\nsinful to kill and eat animals, it was not less sinful to do the like by\r\nvegetables, or their seeds.  None such, he said, should be eaten, save\r\nwhat had died a natural death, such as fruit that was lying on the ground\r\nand about to rot, or cabbage-leaves that had turned yellow in late\r\nautumn.  These and other like garbage he declared to be the only food\r\nthat might be eaten with a clear conscience.  Even so the eater must\r\nplant the pips of any apples or pears that he may have eaten, or any plum-\r\nstones, cherry-stones, and the like, or he would come near to incurring\r\nthe guilt of infanticide.  The grain of cereals, according to him, was\r\nout of the question, for every such grain had a living soul as much as\r\nman had, and had as good a right as man to possess that soul in peace.\r\n\r\nHaving thus driven his fellow countrymen into a corner at the point of a\r\nlogical bayonet from which they felt that there was no escape, he\r\nproposed that the question what was to be done should be referred to an\r\noracle in which the whole country had the greatest confidence, and to\r\nwhich recourse was always had in times of special perplexity.  It was\r\nwhispered that a near relation of the philosopher\'s was lady\'s-maid to\r\nthe priestess who delivered the oracle, and the Puritan party declared\r\nthat the strangely unequivocal answer of the oracle was obtained by\r\nbackstairs influence; but whether this was so or no, the response as\r\nnearly as I can translate it was as follows:-\r\n\r\n   "He who sins aught\r\n   Sins more than he ought;\r\n   But he who sins nought\r\n   Has much to be taught.\r\n   Beat or be beaten,\r\n   Eat or be eaten,\r\n   Be killed or kill;\r\n   Choose which you will."\r\n\r\nIt was clear that this response sanctioned at any rate the destruction of\r\nvegetable life when wanted as food by man; and so forcibly had the\r\nphilosopher shown that what was sauce for vegetables was so also for\r\nanimals, that, though the Puritan party made a furious outcry, the acts\r\nforbidding the use of meat were repealed by a considerable majority.\r\nThus, after several hundred years of wandering in the wilderness of\r\nphilosophy, the country reached the conclusions that common sense had\r\nlong since arrived at.  Even the Puritans after a vain attempt to subsist\r\non a kind of jam made of apples and yellow cabbage leaves, succumbed to\r\nthe inevitable, and resigned themselves to a diet of roast beef and\r\nmutton, with all the usual adjuncts of a modern dinner-table.\r\n\r\nOne would have thought that the dance they had been led by the old\r\nprophet, and that still madder dance which the Professor of botany had\r\ngravely, but as I believe insidiously, proposed to lead them, would have\r\nmade the Erewhonians for a long time suspicious of prophets whether they\r\nprofessed to have communications with an unseen power or no; but so\r\nengrained in the human heart is the desire to believe that some people\r\nreally do know what they say they know, and can thus save them from the\r\ntrouble of thinking for themselves, that in a short time would-be\r\nphilosophers and faddists became more powerful than ever, and gradually\r\nled their countrymen to accept all those absurd views of life, some\r\naccount of which I have given in my earlier chapters.  Indeed I can see\r\nno hope for the Erewhonians till they have got to understand that reason\r\nuncorrected by instinct is as bad as instinct uncorrected by reason.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII: ESCAPE\r\n\r\n\r\nThough busily engaged in translating the extracts given in the last five\r\nchapters, I was also laying matters in train for my escape with Arowhena.\r\nAnd indeed it was high time, for I received an intimation from one of the\r\ncashiers of the Musical Banks, that I was to be prosecuted in a criminal\r\ncourt ostensibly for measles, but really for having owned a watch, and\r\nattempted the reintroduction of machinery.\r\n\r\nI asked why measles? and was told that there was a fear lest extenuating\r\ncircumstances should prevent a jury from convicting me, if I were\r\nindicted for typhus or small-pox, but that a verdict would probably be\r\nobtained for measles, a disease which could be sufficiently punished in a\r\nperson of my age.  I was given to understand that unless some unexpected\r\nchange should come over the mind of his Majesty, I might expect the blow\r\nto be struck within a very few days.\r\n\r\nMy plan was this--that Arowhena and I should escape in a balloon\r\ntogether.  I fear that the reader will disbelieve this part of my story,\r\nyet in no other have I endeavoured to adhere more conscientiously to\r\nfacts, and can only throw myself upon his charity.\r\n\r\nI had already gained the ear of the Queen, and had so worked upon her\r\ncuriosity that she promised to get leave for me to have a balloon made\r\nand inflated; I pointed out to her that no complicated machinery would be\r\nwanted--nothing, in fact, but a large quantity of oiled silk, a car, a\r\nfew ropes, &c., &c., and some light kind of gas, such as the antiquarians\r\nwho were acquainted with the means employed by the ancients for the\r\nproduction of the lighter gases could easily instruct her workmen how to\r\nprovide.  Her eagerness to see so strange a sight as the ascent of a\r\nhuman being into the sky overcame any scruples of conscience that she\r\nmight have otherwise felt, and she set the antiquarians about showing her\r\nworkmen how to make the gas, and sent her maids to buy, and oil, a very\r\nlarge quantity of silk (for I was determined that the balloon should be a\r\nbig one) even before she began to try and gain the King\'s permission;\r\nthis, however, she now set herself to do, for I had sent her word that my\r\nprosecution was imminent.\r\n\r\nAs for myself, I need hardly say that I knew nothing about balloons; nor\r\ndid I see my way to smuggling Arowhena into the car; nevertheless,\r\nknowing that we had no other chance of getting away from Erewhon, I drew\r\ninspiration from the extremity in which we were placed, and made a\r\npattern from which the Queen\'s workmen were able to work successfully.\r\nMeanwhile the Queen\'s carriage-builders set about making the car, and it\r\nwas with the attachments of this to the balloon that I had the greatest\r\ndifficulty; I doubt, indeed, whether I should have succeeded here, but\r\nfor the great intelligence of a foreman, who threw himself heart and soul\r\ninto the matter, and often both foresaw requirements, the necessity for\r\nwhich had escaped me, and suggested the means of providing for them.\r\n\r\nIt happened that there had been a long drought, during the latter part of\r\nwhich prayers had been vainly offered up in all the temples of the air\r\ngod.  When I first told her Majesty that I wanted a balloon, I said my\r\nintention was to go up into the sky and prevail upon the air god by means\r\nof a personal interview.  I own that this proposition bordered on the\r\nidolatrous, but I have long since repented of it, and am little likely\r\never to repeat the offence.  Moreover the deceit, serious though it was,\r\nwill probably lead to the conversion of the whole country.\r\n\r\nWhen the Queen told his Majesty of my proposal, he at first not only\r\nridiculed it, but was inclined to veto it.  Being, however, a very\r\nuxorious husband, he at length consented--as he eventually always did to\r\neverything on which the Queen had set her heart.  He yielded all the more\r\nreadily now, because he did not believe in the possibility of my ascent;\r\nhe was convinced that even though the balloon should mount a few feet\r\ninto the air, it would collapse immediately, whereon I should fall and\r\nbreak my neck, and he should be rid of me.  He demonstrated this to her\r\nso convincingly, that she was alarmed, and tried to talk me into giving\r\nup the idea, but on finding that I persisted in my wish to have the\r\nballoon made, she produced an order from the King to the effect that all\r\nfacilities I might require should be afforded me.\r\n\r\nAt the same time her Majesty told me that my attempted ascent would be\r\nmade an article of impeachment against me in case I did not succeed in\r\nprevailing on the air god to stop the drought.  Neither King nor Queen\r\nhad any idea that I meant going right away if I could get the wind to\r\ntake me, nor had he any conception of the existence of a certain steady\r\nupper current of air which was always setting in one direction, as could\r\nbe seen by the shape of the higher clouds, which pointed invariably from\r\nsouth-east to north-west.  I had myself long noticed this peculiarity in\r\nthe climate, and attributed it, I believe justly, to a trade-wind which\r\nwas constant at a few thousand feet above the earth, but was disturbed by\r\nlocal influences at lower elevations.\r\n\r\nMy next business was to break the plan to Arowhena, and to devise the\r\nmeans for getting her into the car.  I felt sure that she would come with\r\nme, but had made up my mind that if her courage failed her, the whole\r\nthing should come to nothing.  Arowhena and I had been in constant\r\ncommunication through her maid, but I had thought it best not to tell her\r\nthe details of my scheme till everything was settled.  The time had now\r\narrived, and I arranged with the maid that I should be admitted by a\r\nprivate door into Mr. Nosnibor\'s garden at about dusk on the following\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nI came at the appointed time; the girl let me into the garden and bade me\r\nwait in a secluded alley until Arowhena should come.  It was now early\r\nsummer, and the leaves were so thick upon the trees that even though some\r\none else had entered the garden I could have easily hidden myself.  The\r\nnight was one of extreme beauty; the sun had long set, but there was\r\nstill a rosy gleam in the sky over the ruins of the railway station;\r\nbelow me was the city already twinkling with lights, while beyond it\r\nstretched the plains for many a league until they blended with the sky.  I\r\njust noted these things, but I could not heed them.  I could heed\r\nnothing, till, as I peered into the darkness of the alley, I perceived a\r\nwhite figure gliding swiftly towards me.  I bounded towards it, and ere\r\nthought could either prompt or check, I had caught Arowhena to my heart\r\nand covered her unresisting cheek with kisses.\r\n\r\nSo overjoyed were we that we knew not how to speak; indeed I do not know\r\nwhen we should have found words and come to our senses, if the maid had\r\nnot gone off into a fit of hysterics, and awakened us to the necessity of\r\nself-control; then, briefly and plainly, I unfolded what I proposed; I\r\nshowed her the darkest side, for I felt sure that the darker the prospect\r\nthe more likely she was to come.  I told her that my plan would probably\r\nend in death for both of us, and that I dared not press it--that at a\r\nword from her it should be abandoned; still that there was just a\r\npossibility of our escaping together to some part of the world where\r\nthere would be no bar to our getting married, and that I could see no\r\nother hope.\r\n\r\nShe made no resistance, not a sign or hint of doubt or hesitation.  She\r\nwould do all I told her, and come whenever I was ready; so I bade her\r\nsend her maid to meet me nightly--told her that she must put a good face\r\non, look as bright and happy as she could, so as to make her father and\r\nmother and Zulora think that she was forgetting me--and be ready at a\r\nmoment\'s notice to come to the Queen\'s workshops, and be concealed among\r\nthe ballast and under rugs in the car of the balloon; and so we parted.\r\n\r\nI hurried my preparations forward, for I feared rain, and also that the\r\nKing might change his mind; but the weather continued dry, and in another\r\nweek the Queen\'s workmen had finished the balloon and car, while the gas\r\nwas ready to be turned on into the balloon at any moment.  All being now\r\nprepared I was to ascend on the following morning.  I had stipulated for\r\nbeing allowed to take abundance of rugs and wrappings as protection from\r\nthe cold of the upper atmosphere, and also ten or a dozen good-sized bags\r\nof ballast.\r\n\r\nI had nearly a quarter\'s pension in hand, and with this I fee\'d\r\nArowhena\'s maid, and bribed the Queen\'s foreman--who would, I believe,\r\nhave given me assistance even without a bribe.  He helped me to secrete\r\nfood and wine in the bags of ballast, and on the morning of my ascent he\r\nkept the other workmen out of the way while I got Arowhena into the car.\r\nShe came with early dawn, muffled up, and in her maid\'s dress.  She was\r\nsupposed to be gone to an early performance at one of the Musical Banks,\r\nand told me that she should not be missed till breakfast, but that her\r\nabsence must then be discovered.  I arranged the ballast about her so\r\nthat it should conceal her as she lay at the bottom of the car, and\r\ncovered her with wrappings.  Although it still wanted some hours of the\r\ntime fixed for my ascent, I could not trust myself one moment from the\r\ncar, so I got into it at once, and watched the gradual inflation of the\r\nballoon.  Luggage I had none, save the provisions hidden in the ballast\r\nbags, the books of mythology, and the treatises on the machines, with my\r\nown manuscript diaries and translations.\r\n\r\nI sat quietly, and awaited the hour fixed for my departure--quiet\r\noutwardly, but inwardly I was in an agony of suspense lest Arowhena\'s\r\nabsence should be discovered before the arrival of the King and Queen,\r\nwho were to witness my ascent.  They were not due yet for another two\r\nhours, and during this time a hundred things might happen, any one of\r\nwhich would undo me.\r\n\r\nAt last the balloon was full; the pipe which had filled it was removed,\r\nthe escape of the gas having been first carefully precluded.  Nothing\r\nremained to hinder the balloon from ascending but the hands and weight of\r\nthose who were holding on to it with ropes.  I strained my eyes for the\r\ncoming of the King and Queen, but could see no sign of their approach.  I\r\nlooked in the direction of Mr. Nosnibor\'s house--there was nothing to\r\nindicate disturbance, but it was not yet breakfast time.  The crowd began\r\nto gather; they were aware that I was under the displeasure of the court,\r\nbut I could detect no signs of my being unpopular.  On the contrary, I\r\nreceived many kindly expressions of regard and encouragement, with good\r\nwishes as to the result of my journey.\r\n\r\nI was speaking to one gentleman of my acquaintance, and telling him the\r\nsubstance of what I intended to do when I had got into the presence of\r\nthe air god (what he thought of me I cannot guess, for I am sure that he\r\ndid not believe in the objective existence of the air god, nor that I\r\nmyself believed in it), when I became aware of a small crowd of people\r\nrunning as fast as they could from Mr. Nosnibor\'s house towards the\r\nQueen\'s workshops.  For the moment my pulse ceased beating, and then,\r\nknowing that the time had come when I must either do or die, I called\r\nvehemently to those who were holding the ropes (some thirty men) to let\r\ngo at once, and made gestures signifying danger, and that there would be\r\nmischief if they held on longer.  Many obeyed; the rest were too weak to\r\nhold on to the ropes, and were forced to let them go.  On this the\r\nballoon bounded suddenly upwards, but my own feeling was that the earth\r\nhad dropped off from me, and was sinking fast into the open space\r\nbeneath.\r\n\r\nThis happened at the very moment that the attention of the crowd was\r\ndivided, the one half paying heed to the eager gestures of those coming\r\nfrom Mr. Nosnibor\'s house, and the other to the exclamations from myself.\r\nA minute more and Arowhena would doubtless have been discovered, but\r\nbefore that minute was over, I was at such a height above the city that\r\nnothing could harm me, and every second both the town and the crowd\r\nbecame smaller and more confused.  In an incredibly short time, I could\r\nsee little but a vast wall of blue plains rising up against me, towards\r\nwhichever side I looked.\r\n\r\nAt first, the balloon mounted vertically upwards, but after about five\r\nminutes, when we had already attained a very great elevation, I fancied\r\nthat the objects on the plain beneath began to move from under me.  I did\r\nnot feel so much as a breath of wind, and could not suppose that the\r\nballoon itself was travelling.  I was, therefore, wondering what this\r\nstrange movement of fixed objects could mean, when it struck me that\r\npeople in a balloon do not feel the wind inasmuch as they travel with it\r\nand offer it no resistance.  Then I was happy in thinking that I must now\r\nhave reached the invariable trade wind of the upper air, and that I\r\nshould be very possibly wafted for hundreds or even thousands of miles,\r\nfar from Erewhon and the Erewhonians.\r\n\r\nAlready I had removed the wrappings and freed Arowhena; but I soon\r\ncovered her up with them again, for it was already very cold, and she was\r\nhalf stupefied with the strangeness of her position.\r\n\r\nAnd now began a time, dream-like and delirious, of which I do not suppose\r\nthat I shall ever recover a distinct recollection.  Some things I can\r\nrecall--as that we were ere long enveloped in vapour which froze upon my\r\nmoustache and whiskers; then comes a memory of sitting for hours and\r\nhours in a thick fog, hearing no sound but my own breathing and\r\nArowhena\'s (for we hardly spoke) and seeing no sight but the car beneath\r\nus and beside us, and the dark balloon above.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most painful feeling when the earth was hidden was that the\r\nballoon was motionless, though our only hope lay in our going forward\r\nwith an extreme of speed.  From time to time through a rift in the clouds\r\nI caught a glimpse of earth, and was thankful to perceive that we must be\r\nflying forward faster than in an express train; but no sooner was the\r\nrift closed than the old conviction of our being stationary returned in\r\nfull force, and was not to be reasoned with: there was another feeling\r\nalso which was nearly as bad; for as a child that fears it has gone blind\r\nin a long tunnel if there is no light, so ere the earth had been many\r\nminutes hidden, I became half frightened lest we might not have broken\r\naway from it clean and for ever.  Now and again, I ate and gave food to\r\nArowhena, but by guess-work as regards time.  Then came darkness, a\r\ndreadful dreary time, without even the moon to cheer us.\r\n\r\nWith dawn the scene was changed: the clouds were gone and morning stars\r\nwere shining; the rising of the splendid sun remains still impressed upon\r\nme as the most glorious that I have ever seen; beneath us there was an\r\nembossed chain of mountains with snow fresh fallen upon them; but we were\r\nfar above them; we both of us felt our breathing seriously affected, but\r\nI would not allow the balloon to descend a single inch, not knowing for\r\nhow long we might not need all the buoyancy which we could command;\r\nindeed I was thankful to find that, after nearly four-and-twenty hours,\r\nwe were still at so great a height above the earth.\r\n\r\nIn a couple of hours we had passed the ranges, which must have been some\r\nhundred and fifty miles across, and again I saw a tract of level plain\r\nextending far away to the horizon.  I knew not where we were, and dared\r\nnot descend, lest I should waste the power of the balloon, but I was half\r\nhopeful that we might be above the country from which I had originally\r\nstarted.  I looked anxiously for any sign by which I could recognise it,\r\nbut could see nothing, and feared that we might be above some distant\r\npart of Erewhon, or a country inhabited by savages.  While I was still in\r\ndoubt, the balloon was again wrapped in clouds, and we were left to blank\r\nspace and to conjectures.\r\n\r\nThe weary time dragged on.  How I longed for my unhappy watch!  I felt as\r\nthough not even time was moving, so dumb and spell-bound were our\r\nsurroundings.  Sometimes I would feel my pulse, and count its beats for\r\nhalf-an-hour together; anything to mark the time--to prove that it was\r\nthere, and to assure myself that we were within the blessed range of its\r\ninfluence, and not gone adrift into the timelessness of eternity.\r\n\r\nI had been doing this for the twentieth or thirtieth time, and had fallen\r\ninto a light sleep: I dreamed wildly of a journey in an express train,\r\nand of arriving at a railway station where the air was full of the sound\r\nof locomotive engines blowing off steam with a horrible and tremendous\r\nhissing; I woke frightened and uneasy, but the hissing and crashing\r\nnoises pursued me now that I was awake, and forced me to own that they\r\nwere real.  What they were I knew not, but they grew gradually fainter\r\nand fainter, and after a time were lost.  In a few hours the clouds\r\nbroke, and I saw beneath me that which made the chilled blood run colder\r\nin my veins.  I saw the sea, and nothing but the sea; in the main black,\r\nbut flecked with white heads of storm-tossed, angry waves.\r\n\r\nArowhena was sleeping quietly at the bottom of the car, and as I looked\r\nat her sweet and saintly beauty, I groaned, and cursed myself for the\r\nmisery into which I had brought her; but there was nothing for it now.\r\n\r\nI sat and waited for the worst, and presently I saw signs as though that\r\nworst were soon to be at hand, for the balloon had begun to sink.  On\r\nfirst seeing the sea I had been impressed with the idea that we must have\r\nbeen falling, but now there could be no mistake, we were sinking, and\r\nthat fast.  I threw out a bag of ballast, and for a time we rose again,\r\nbut in the course of a few hours the sinking recommenced, and I threw out\r\nanother bag.\r\n\r\nThen the battle commenced in earnest.  It lasted all that afternoon and\r\nthrough the night until the following evening.  I had seen never a sail\r\nnor a sign of a sail, though I had half blinded myself with straining my\r\neyes incessantly in every direction; we had parted with everything but\r\nthe clothes which we had upon our backs; food and water were gone, all\r\nthrown out to the wheeling albatrosses, in order to save us a few hours\r\nor even minutes from the sea.  I did not throw away the books till we\r\nwere within a few feet of the water, and clung to my manuscripts to the\r\nvery last.  Hope there seemed none whatever--yet, strangely enough we\r\nwere neither of us utterly hopeless, and even when the evil that we\r\ndreaded was upon us, and that which we greatly feared had come, we sat in\r\nthe car of the balloon with the waters up to our middle, and still smiled\r\nwith a ghastly hopefulness to one another.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nHe who has crossed the St. Gothard will remember that below Andermatt\r\nthere is one of those Alpine gorges which reach the very utmost limits of\r\nthe sublime and terrible.  The feelings of the traveller have become more\r\nand more highly wrought at every step, until at last the naked and\r\noverhanging precipices seem to close above his head, as he crosses a\r\nbridge hung in mid-air over a roaring waterfall, and enters on the\r\ndarkness of a tunnel, hewn out of the rock.\r\n\r\nWhat can be in store for him on emerging?  Surely something even wilder\r\nand more desolate than that which he has seen already; yet his\r\nimagination is paralysed, and can suggest no fancy or vision of anything\r\nto surpass the reality which he had just witnessed.  Awed and breathless\r\nhe advances; when lo! the light of the afternoon sun welcomes him as he\r\nleaves the tunnel, and behold a smiling valley--a babbling brook, a\r\nvillage with tall belfries, and meadows of brilliant green--these are the\r\nthings which greet him, and he smiles to himself as the terror passes\r\naway and in another moment is forgotten.\r\n\r\nSo fared it now with ourselves.  We had been in the water some two or\r\nthree hours, and the night had come upon us.  We had said farewell for\r\nthe hundredth time, and had resigned ourselves to meet the end; indeed I\r\nwas myself battling with a drowsiness from which it was only too probable\r\nthat I should never wake; when suddenly, Arowhena touched me on the\r\nshoulder, and pointed to a light and to a dark mass which was bearing\r\nright upon us.  A cry for help--loud and clear and shrill--broke forth\r\nfrom both of us at once; and in another five minutes we were carried by\r\nkind and tender hands on to the deck of an Italian vessel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX: CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ship was the _Principe Umberto_, bound from Callao to Genoa; she had\r\ncarried a number of emigrants to Rio, had gone thence to Callao, where\r\nshe had taken in a cargo of guano, and was now on her way home.  The\r\ncaptain was a certain Giovanni Gianni, a native of Sestri; he has kindly\r\nallowed me to refer to him in case the truth of my story should be\r\ndisputed; but I grieve to say that I suffered him to mislead himself in\r\nsome important particulars.  I should add that when we were picked up we\r\nwere a thousand miles from land.\r\n\r\nAs soon as we were on board, the captain began questioning us about the\r\nsiege of Paris, from which city he had assumed that we must have come,\r\nnotwithstanding our immense distance from Europe.  As may be supposed, I\r\nhad not heard a syllable about the war between France and Germany, and\r\nwas too ill to do more than assent to all that he chose to put into my\r\nmouth.  My knowledge of Italian is very imperfect, and I gathered little\r\nfrom anything that he said; but I was glad to conceal the true point of\r\nour departure, and resolved to take any cue that he chose to give me.\r\n\r\nThe line that thus suggested itself was that there had been ten or twelve\r\nothers in the balloon, that I was an English Milord, and Arowhena a\r\nRussian Countess; that all the others had been drowned, and that the\r\ndespatches which we had carried were lost.  I came afterwards to learn\r\nthat this story would not have been credible, had not the captain been\r\nfor some weeks at sea, for I found that when we were picked up, the\r\nGermans had already long been masters of Paris.  As it was, the captain\r\nsettled the whole story for me, and I was well content.\r\n\r\nIn a few days we sighted an English vessel bound from Melbourne to London\r\nwith wool.  At my earnest request, in spite of stormy weather which\r\nrendered it dangerous for a boat to take us from one ship to the other,\r\nthe captain consented to signal the English vessel, and we were received\r\non board, but we were transferred with such difficulty that no\r\ncommunication took place as to the manner of our being found.  I did\r\nindeed hear the Italian mate who was in charge of the boat shout out\r\nsomething in French to the effect that we had been picked up from a\r\nballoon, but the noise of the wind was so great, and the captain\r\nunderstood so little French that he caught nothing of the truth, and it\r\nwas assumed that we were two persons who had been saved from shipwreck.\r\nWhen the captain asked me in what ship I had been wrecked, I said that a\r\nparty of us had been carried out to sea in a pleasure-boat by a strong\r\ncurrent, and that Arowhena (whom I described as a Peruvian lady) and I\r\nwere alone saved.\r\n\r\nThere were several passengers, whose goodness towards us we can never\r\nrepay.  I grieve to think that they cannot fail to discover that we did\r\nnot take them fully into our confidence; but had we told them all, they\r\nwould not have believed us, and I was determined that no one should hear\r\nof Erewhon, or have the chance of getting there before me, as long as I\r\ncould prevent it.  Indeed, the recollection of the many falsehoods which\r\nI was then obliged to tell, would render my life miserable were I not\r\nsustained by the consolations of my religion.  Among the passengers there\r\nwas a most estimable clergyman, by whom Arowhena and I were married\r\nwithin a very few days of our coming on board.\r\n\r\nAfter a prosperous voyage of about two months, we sighted the Land\'s End,\r\nand in another week we were landed at London.  A liberal subscription was\r\nmade for us on board the ship, so that we found ourselves in no immediate\r\ndifficulty about money.  I accordingly took Arowhena down into\r\nSomersetshire, where my mother and sisters had resided when I last heard\r\nof them.  To my great sorrow I found that my mother was dead, and that\r\nher death had been accelerated by the report of my having been killed,\r\nwhich had been brought to my employer\'s station by Chowbok.  It appeared\r\nthat he must have waited for a few days to see whether I returned, that\r\nhe then considered it safe to assume that I should never do so, and had\r\naccordingly made up a story about my having fallen into a whirlpool of\r\nseething waters while coming down the gorge homeward.  Search was made\r\nfor my body, but the rascal had chosen to drown me in a place where there\r\nwould be no chance of its ever being recovered.\r\n\r\nMy sisters were both married, but neither of their husbands was rich.  No\r\none seemed overjoyed on my return; and I soon discovered that when a\r\nman\'s relations have once mourned for him as dead, they seldom like the\r\nprospect of having to mourn for him a second time.\r\n\r\nAccordingly I returned to London with my wife, and through the assistance\r\nof an old friend supported myself by writing good little stories for the\r\nmagazines, and for a tract society.  I was well paid; and I trust that I\r\nmay not be considered presumptuous in saying that some of the most\r\npopular of the _brochures_ which are distributed in the streets, and\r\nwhich are to be found in the waiting-rooms of the railway stations, have\r\nproceeded from my pen.  During the time that I could spare, I arranged my\r\nnotes and diary till they assumed their present shape.  There remains\r\nnothing for me to add, save to unfold the scheme which I propose for the\r\nconversion of Erewhon.\r\n\r\nThat scheme has only been quite recently decided upon as the one which\r\nseems most likely to be successful.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen at once that it would be madness for me to go with ten or\r\na dozen subordinate missionaries by the same way as that which led me to\r\ndiscover Erewhon.  I should be imprisoned for typhus, besides being\r\nhanded over to the straighteners for having run away with Arowhena: an\r\neven darker fate, to which I dare hardly again allude, would be reserved\r\nfor my devoted fellow-labourers.  It is plain, therefore, that some other\r\nway must be found for getting at the Erewhonians, and I am thankful to\r\nsay that such another way is not wanting.  One of the rivers which\r\ndescends from the Snowy Mountains, and passes through Erewhon, is known\r\nto be navigable for several hundred miles from its mouth.  Its upper\r\nwaters have never yet been explored, but I feel little doubt that it will\r\nbe found possible to take a light gunboat (for we must protect ourselves)\r\nto the outskirts of the Erewhonian country.\r\n\r\nI propose, therefore, that one of those associations should be formed in\r\nwhich the risk of each of the members is confined to the amount of his\r\nstake in the concern.  The first step would be to draw up a prospectus.\r\nIn this I would advise that no mention should be made of the fact that\r\nthe Erewhonians are the lost tribes.  The discovery is one of absorbing\r\ninterest to myself, but it is of a sentimental rather than commercial\r\nvalue, and business is business.  The capital to be raised should not be\r\nless than fifty thousand pounds, and might be either in five or ten pound\r\nshares as hereafter determined.  This should be amply sufficient for the\r\nexpenses of an experimental voyage.\r\n\r\nWhen the money had been subscribed, it would be our duty to charter a\r\nsteamer of some twelve or fourteen hundred tons burden, and with\r\naccommodation for a cargo of steerage passengers.  She should carry two\r\nor three guns in case of her being attacked by savages at the mouth of\r\nthe river.  Boats of considerable size should be also provided, and I\r\nthink it would be desirable that these also should carry two or three six-\r\npounders.  The ship should be taken up the river as far as was considered\r\nsafe, and a picked party should then ascend in the boats.  The presence\r\nboth of Arowhena and myself would be necessary at this stage, inasmuch as\r\nour knowledge of the language would disarm suspicion, and facilitate\r\nnegotiations.\r\n\r\nWe should begin by representing the advantages afforded to labour in the\r\ncolony of Queensland, and point out to the Erewhonians that by emigrating\r\nthither, they would be able to amass, each and all of them, enormous\r\nfortunes--a fact which would be easily provable by a reference to\r\nstatistics.  I have no doubt that a very great number might be thus\r\ninduced to come back with us in the larger boats, and that we could fill\r\nour vessel with emigrants in three or four journeys.\r\n\r\nShould we be attacked, our course would be even simpler, for the\r\nErewhonians have no gunpowder, and would be so surprised with its effects\r\nthat we should be able to capture as many as we chose; in this case we\r\nshould feel able to engage them on more advantageous terms, for they\r\nwould be prisoners of war.  But even though we were to meet with no\r\nviolence, I doubt not that a cargo of seven or eight hundred Erewhonians\r\ncould be induced, when they were once on board the vessel, to sign an\r\nagreement which should be mutually advantageous both to us and them.\r\n\r\nWe should then proceed to Queensland, and dispose of our engagement with\r\nthe Erewhonians to the sugar-growers of that settlement, who are in great\r\nwant of labour; it is believed that the money thus realised would enable\r\nus to declare a handsome dividend, and leave a considerable balance,\r\nwhich might be spent in repeating our operations and bringing over other\r\ncargoes of Erewhonians, with fresh consequent profits.  In fact we could\r\ngo backwards and forwards as long as there was a demand for labour in\r\nQueensland, or indeed in any other Christian colony, for the supply of\r\nErewhonians would be unlimited, and they could be packed closely and fed\r\nat a very reasonable cost.\r\n\r\nIt would be my duty and Arowhena\'s to see that our emigrants should be\r\nboarded and lodged in the households of religious sugar-growers; these\r\npersons would give them the benefit of that instruction whereof they\r\nstand so greatly in need.  Each day, as soon as they could be spared from\r\ntheir work in the plantations, they would be assembled for praise, and be\r\nthoroughly grounded in the Church Catechism, while the whole of every\r\nSabbath should be devoted to singing psalms and church-going.\r\n\r\nThis must be insisted upon, both in order to put a stop to any uneasy\r\nfeeling which might show itself either in Queensland or in the mother\r\ncountry as to the means whereby the Erewhonians had been obtained, and\r\nalso because it would give our own shareholders the comfort of reflecting\r\nthat they were saving souls and filling their own pockets at one and the\r\nsame moment.  By the time the emigrants had got too old for work they\r\nwould have become thoroughly instructed in religion; they could then be\r\nshipped back to Erewhon and carry the good seed with them.\r\n\r\nI can see no hitch nor difficulty about the matter, and trust that this\r\nbook will sufficiently advertise the scheme to insure the subscription of\r\nthe necessary capital; as soon as this is forthcoming I will guarantee\r\nthat I convert the Erewhonians not only into good Christians but into a\r\nsource of considerable profit to the shareholders.\r\n\r\nI should add that I cannot claim the credit for having originated the\r\nabove scheme.  I had been for months at my wit\'s end, forming plan after\r\nplan for the evangelisation of Erewhon, when by one of those special\r\ninterpositions which should be a sufficient answer to the sceptic, and\r\nmake even the most confirmed rationalist irrational, my eye was directed\r\nto the following paragraph in the _Times_ newspaper, of one of the first\r\ndays in January 1872:-\r\n\r\n   "POLYNESIANS IN QUEENSLAND.--The Marquis of Normanby, the new Governor\r\n   of Queensland, has completed his inspection of the northern districts\r\n   of the colony.  It is stated that at Mackay, one of the best sugar-\r\n   growing districts, his Excellency saw a good deal of the Polynesians.\r\n   In the course of a speech to those who entertained him there, the\r\n   Marquis said:--\'I have been told that the means by which Polynesians\r\n   were obtained were not legitimate, but I have failed to perceive this,\r\n   in so far at least as Queensland is concerned; and, if one can judge\r\n   by the countenances and manners of the Polynesians, they experience no\r\n   regret at their position.\'  But his Excellency pointed out the\r\n   advantage of giving them religious instruction.  It would tend to set\r\n   at rest an uneasy feeling which at present existed in the country to\r\n   know that they were inclined to retain the Polynesians, and teach them\r\n   religion."\r\n\r\nI feel that comment is unnecessary, and will therefore conclude with one\r\nword of thanks to the reader who may have had the patience to follow me\r\nthrough my adventures without losing his temper; but with two, for any\r\nwho may write at once to the Secretary of the Erewhon Evangelisation\r\nCompany, limited (at the address which shall hereafter be advertised),\r\nand request to have his name put down as a shareholder.\r\n\r\n   _P.S_.--I had just received and corrected the last proof of the\r\n   foregoing volume, and was walking down the Strand from Temple Bar to\r\n   Charing Cross, when on passing Exeter Hall I saw a number of devout-\r\n   looking people crowding into the building with faces full of\r\n   interested and complacent anticipation.  I stopped, and saw an\r\n   announcement that a missionary meeting was to be held forthwith, and\r\n   that the native missionary, the Rev. William Habakkuk, from----(the\r\n   colony from which I had started on my adventures), would be\r\n   introduced, and make a short address.  After some little difficulty I\r\n   obtained admission, and heard two or three speeches, which were\r\n   prefatory to the introduction of Mr. Habakkuk.  One of these struck me\r\n   as perhaps the most presumptuous that I had ever heard.  The speaker\r\n   said that the races of whom Mr. Habakkuk was a specimen, were in all\r\n   probability the lost ten tribes of Israel.  I dared not contradict him\r\n   then, but I felt angry and injured at hearing the speaker jump to so\r\n   preposterous a conclusion upon such insufficient grounds.  The\r\n   discovery of the ten tribes was mine, and mine only.  I was still in\r\n   the very height of indignation, when there was a murmur of expectation\r\n   in the hall, and Mr. Habakkuk was brought forward.  The reader may\r\n   judge of my surprise at finding that he was none other than my old\r\n   friend Chowbok!\r\n\r\nMy jaw dropped, and my eyes almost started out of my head with\r\nastonishment.  The poor fellow was dreadfully frightened, and the storm\r\nof applause which greeted his introduction seemed only to add to his\r\nconfusion.  I dare not trust myself to report his speech--indeed I could\r\nhardly listen to it, for I was nearly choked with trying to suppress my\r\nfeelings.  I am sure that I caught the words "Adelaide, the Queen\r\nDowager," and I thought that I heard "Mary Magdalene" shortly afterwards,\r\nbut I had then to leave the hall for fear of being turned out.  While on\r\nthe staircase, I heard another burst of prolonged and rapturous applause,\r\nso I suppose the audience were satisfied.\r\n\r\nThe feelings that came uppermost in my mind were hardly of a very solemn\r\ncharacter, but I thought of my first acquaintance with Chowbok, of the\r\nscene in the woodshed, of the innumerable lies he had told me, of his\r\nrepeated attempts upon the brandy, and of many an incident which I have\r\nnot thought it worth while to dwell upon; and I could not but derive some\r\nsatisfaction from the hope that my own efforts might have contributed to\r\nthe change which had been doubtless wrought upon him, and that the rite\r\nwhich I had performed, however unprofessionally, on that wild upland\r\nriver-bed, had not been wholly without effect.  I trust that what I have\r\nwritten about him in the earlier part of my book may not be libellous,\r\nand that it may do him no harm with his employers.  He was then\r\nunregenerate.  I must certainly find him out and have a talk with him;\r\nbut before I shall have time to do so these pages will be in the hands of\r\nthe public.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nAt the last moment I see a probability of a complication which causes me\r\nmuch uneasiness.

I am also informed, that almost all machines have\r\ntheir own tricks and idiosyncrasies; that they know their drivers and\r\nkeepers; and that they will play pranks upon a stranger.  It is my\r\nintention, on a future occasion, to bring together examples both of the\r\nexpressions in common use among mechanicians, and of any extraordinary\r\nexhibitions of mechanical sagacity and eccentricity that I can meet\r\nwith--not as believing in the Erewhonian Professor\'s theory, but from the\r\ninterest of the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK EREWHON***\r\n\r\n\r\n******* This file should be named 1906.txt or 1906.zip *******\r\n\r\n\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/9/0/1906\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at https://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit https://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit:\r\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     https://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n'
