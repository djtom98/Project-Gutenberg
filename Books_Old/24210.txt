In 1829 the bank in which\r\nshe, her mother and her sisters, had placed their money, failed and she\r\nwas forced to earn a living through writing, at which she was very\r\ntalented, particularly on political issues, such as the poverty facing a\r\nfamily on the death of the wage-earner.  In 1839, after her travels in\r\nAmerica, she wrote two long novels, of which Deerbrook was one, and a\r\nbook about Toussaint L\'Ouverture the other.\r\n\r\nThis book, therefore gives great insight into the lives of upper middle\r\nclass families of the mid nineteenth century.  No one in families these\r\ndays talks to the rest of the family in the polite, perhaps over-polite,\r\nterms used in this book.  For this reason, though it was not meant to be\r\ntaken as such, this book is a true social document.\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________________________\r\nDEERBROOK, BY HARRIET MARTINEAU.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER ONE.\r\n\r\nAN EVENT.\r\n\r\nEvery town-bred person who travels in a rich country region, knows what\r\nit is to see a neat white house planted in a pretty situation,--in a\r\nshrubbery, or commanding a sunny common, or nestling between two\r\nhills,--and to say to himself, as the carriage sweeps past its gate, "I\r\nshould like to live there,"--"I could be very happy in that pretty\r\nplace."  Transient visions pass before his mind\'s eye of dewy summer\r\nmornings, when the shadows are long on the grass, and of bright autumn\r\nafternoons, when it would be luxury to saunter in the neighbouring\r\nlanes; and of frosty winter days, when the sun shines in over the\r\nlaurustinus at the window, while the fire burns with a different light\r\nfrom that which it gives in the dull parlours of a city.\r\n\r\nMr Grey\'s house had probably been the object of this kind of\r\nspeculation to one or more persons, three times a week, ever since the\r\nstage-coach had begun to pass through Deerbrook.  Deerbrook was a rather\r\npretty village, dignified as it was with the woods of a fine park, which\r\nformed the background to its best points of view.  Of this pretty\r\nvillage, Mr Grey\'s was the prettiest house, standing in a field, round\r\nwhich the road swept.  There were trees enough about it to shade without\r\ndarkening it, and the garden and shrubbery behind were evidently of no\r\ncontemptible extent.  The timber and coal yards, and granaries, which\r\nstretched down to the river side, were hidden by a nice management of\r\nthe garden walls, and training of the shrubbery.\r\n\r\nIn the drawing-room of this tempting white house sat Mrs Grey and her\r\neldest daughter, one spring evening.  It was rather an unusual thing for\r\nthem to be in the drawing-room.  Sophia read history and practised her\r\nmusic every morning in the little blue parlour which looked towards the\r\nroad; and her mother sat in the dining-room, which had the same aspect.\r\nThe advantage of these rooms was, that they commanded the house of Mr\r\nRowland, Mr Grey\'s partner in the corn, coal, and timber business, and\r\nalso the dwelling of Mrs Enderby, Mrs Rowland\'s mother, who lived just\r\nopposite the Rowlands.  The drawing-room looked merely into the garden.\r\nThe only houses seen from it were the greenhouse and the summerhouse;\r\nthe latter of which now served the purpose of a schoolroom for the\r\nchildren of both families, and stood on the boundary-line of the gardens\r\nof the two gentlemen of the firm.  The drawing-room was so dull, that it\r\nwas kept for company; that is, it was used about three times a-year,\r\nwhen the pictures were unveiled, the green baize removed, and the\r\nground-windows, which opened upon the lawn, thrown wide, to afford to\r\nthe rare guests of the family a welcome from birds and flowers.\r\n\r\nThe ground-windows were open now, and on one side sat Mrs Grey, working\r\na rug, and on the other Sophia, working a collar.  The ladies were\r\nevidently in a state of expectation--a state exceedingly trying to\r\npeople who, living at ease in the country, have rarely anything to\r\nexpect beyond the days of the week, the newspaper, and their dinners.\r\nMrs Grey gave her needle a rest every few minutes, to listen! and rang\r\nthe bell three times in a quarter of an hour, to make inquiries of her\r\nmaid about the arrangements of the best bedroom.  Sophia could not\r\nattend to her work, and presently gave information that Fanny and Mary\r\nwere in the orchard.  She was desired to call them, and presently Fanny\r\nand Mary appeared at the window,--twins of ten years old, and very\r\npretty little girls.\r\n\r\n"My dears," said Mrs Grey, "has Miss Young done with you for to-day?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, mamma.  It is just six o\'clock.  We have been out of school\r\nthis hour almost."\r\n\r\n"Then come in, and make yourselves neat, and sit down with us.  I should\r\nnot wonder if the Miss Ibbotsons should be here now before you are\r\nready.  But where is Sydney?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, he is making a pond in his garden there.  He dug it before school\r\nthis morning, and he is filling it now."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said the other; "and I don\'t know when he will have done, for as\r\nfast as he fills it, it empties again, and he says he cannot think how\r\npeople keep their ponds filled."\r\n\r\n"He must have done now, however," said his mother.  "I suppose he is\r\ntearing his clothes to pieces with drawing the water-barrel, and wetting\r\nhimself to the skin besides."\r\n\r\n"And spoiling his garden," said Fanny.  "He has dug up all his hepaticas\r\nand two rose-bushes to make his pond."\r\n\r\n"Go to him, my dears, and tell him to come in directly, and dress\r\nhimself for tea.  Tell him I insist upon it.  Do not run.  Walk quietly.\r\nYou will heat yourselves, and I do not like Mrs Rowland to see you\r\nrunning."\r\n\r\nMary informed her brother that he was to leave his pond and come in, and\r\nFanny added that mamma insisted upon it.  They had time to do this, to\r\nwalk quietly, to have their hair made quite smooth, and to sit down with\r\ntheir two dolls on each side the common cradle, in a corner of the\r\ndrawing-room, before the Miss Ibbotsons arrived.\r\n\r\nThe Miss Ibbotsons were daughters of a distant relation of Mr Grey\'s.\r\nTheir mother had been dead many years; they had now just lost their\r\nfather, and were left without any nearer relation than Mr Grey.  He had\r\ninvited them to visit his family while their father\'s affairs were in\r\ncourse of arrangement, and till it could be discovered what their means\r\nof living were likely to be.  They had passed their lives in Birmingham,\r\nand had every inclination to return to it, when their visit to their\r\nDeerbrook relations should have been paid.  Their old schoolfellows and\r\nfriends all lived there: and they thought it would be easier and\r\npleasanter to make the smallest income supply their wants in their\r\nnative town, than to remove to any place where it might go further.\r\nThey had taken leave of their friends as for a very short time, and when\r\nthey entered Deerbrook, looked around them as upon a place in which they\r\nwere to pass a summer.\r\n\r\nAll Deerbrook had been informed of their expected arrival--as it always\r\nwas of everything which concerned the Greys.  The little Rowlands were\r\nwalking with their mother when the chaise came up the street; but being\r\nparticularly desired not to look at it, they were not much benefited by\r\nthe event.  Their grandmamma, Mrs Enderby, was not at the moment under\r\nthe same restriction; and her high cap might be seen above the green\r\nblind of her parlour as the chaise turned into Mr Grey\'s gate.  The\r\nstationer, the parish clerk, and the milliner and her assistant, had\r\nobtained a passing view of sundry boxes, the face of an elderly woman,\r\nand the outline of two black bonnets,--all that they could boast of to\r\nrepay them for the vigilance of a whole afternoon.\r\n\r\nSophia Grey might be pardoned for some anxiety about the reception of\r\nthe young ladies.  She was four years younger than the younger of them;\r\nand Hester, the elder, was one-and-twenty,--a venerable age to a girl of\r\nsixteen.  Sophia began to think she had never been really afraid of\r\nanything before, though she remembered having cried bitterly when first\r\nleft alone with her governess; and though she had always been remarkable\r\nfor clinging to her mother\'s side on all social occasions, in the\r\napproaching trial her mother could give her little assistance.  These\r\ncousins would be always with her.  How she should read history, or\r\npractise music with them in the room, she could not imagine, nor what\r\nshe should find to say to them all day long.  If poor Elizabeth had but\r\nlived, what a comfort she would have been now; the elder one would have\r\ntaken all the responsibility!  And she heaved a sigh once more, as she\r\nthought, to the memory of poor Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nMr Grey was at a market some miles off; and Sydney was sent by his\r\nmother into the hall, to assist in the work of alighting, and causing\r\nthe luggage to alight.  As any other boy of thirteen would have done, he\r\nslunk behind the hall door, without venturing to speak to the strangers,\r\nand left the business to the guests and the maids.  Mrs Grey and Sophia\r\nawaited them in the drawing-room, and were ready with information about\r\nhow uneasy they had all been about the rain in the morning, till they\r\nremembered that it would lay the dust, and so make the journey\r\npleasanter.  The twins shouldered their dolls, and looked on from their\r\nstools, while Sydney stole in, and for want of some better way of\r\ncovering his awkwardness, began rocking the cradle with his foot, till\r\nhe tilted it over.\r\n\r\nSophia found the first half-hour not at all difficult to surmount.  She\r\nand Margaret Ibbotson informed each other of the precise number of miles\r\nbetween Deerbrook and Birmingham.  She ascertained fully to her\r\nsatisfaction that her guests had dined.  She assisted them in the\r\nobservation that the grass of the lawn looked very green after the\r\nstreets of Birmingham; and she had to tell them that her father was\r\nobliged to attend the market some miles off, and would not be home for\r\nan hour or two.  Then the time came when bonnets were to be taken off,\r\nand she could offer to show the way to the spare-room.  There she took\r\nHester and Margaret to the window, and explained to them what they saw\r\nthence; and, as it was necessary to talk, she poured out what was most\r\nfamiliar to her mind, experiencing a sudden relief from all the unwonted\r\nshyness which had tormented her.\r\n\r\n"That is Mr Rowland\'s house--papa\'s partner, you know.  Isn\'t it an\r\nugly place, with that ridiculous porch to it?  But Mrs Rowland can\r\nnever be satisfied without altering her house once a year.  She has made\r\nMr Rowland spend more money upon that place than would have built a new\r\none of twice the size.--That house opposite is Mrs Enderby\'s, Mrs\r\nRowland\'s mother\'s.  So near as she lives to the Rowlands, it is\r\nshocking how they neglect her.  There could be no difficulty in being\r\nproperly attentive to her, so near as she is, could there?  But when she\r\nis ill we are obliged to go and see her sometimes, when it is very\r\ninconvenient, because Mrs Rowland has never been near her all day.  Is\r\nnot it shocking?"\r\n\r\n"I rather wonder she should complain of her family," observed Margaret.\r\n\r\n"Oh, she is not remarkable for keeping her feelings to herself, poor\r\nsoul!  But really it is wonderful how little she says about it, except\r\nwhen her heart is quite full,--just to us.  She tries to excuse Mrs\r\nRowland all she can; and she makes out that Mrs Rowland is such an\r\nexcellent mother, and so busy with her children, and all that.  But you\r\nknow that is no excuse for not taking care of her own mother."\r\n\r\n"Those are the Verdon woods, are they not?" said Hester, leaning out of\r\nthe window to survey the whole of the sunny prospect.  "I suppose you\r\nspend half your days in those woods in summer."\r\n\r\n"No; mamma goes out very little, and I seldom walk beyond the garden.\r\nBut now you are come, we shall go everywhere.  Ours is considered a very\r\npretty village."\r\n\r\nThe sisters thought it so beautiful, that they gazed as if they feared\r\nit would melt away if they withdrew their eyes.  The one discovered the\r\nbridge, lying in shadow; the other the pointed roof of the building\r\nwhich surmounted the spring in the park woods.  Sophia was well pleased\r\nat their pleasure; and their questions, and her descriptions, went on\r\nimproving in rapidity, till a knock at the door of the room cut short\r\nthe catechism.  It was Morris, the Miss Ibbotsons\' maid; and her\r\nappearance gave Sophia a hint to leave her guests to refresh themselves.\r\nShe glanced over the room, to see that nothing was wanting; pointed out\r\nthe bell, intimated that the washstands were mahogany, which showed\r\nevery splash, and explained that the green blinds were meant to be\r\nalways down when the sun shone in, lest it should fade the carpet.  She\r\nthen withdrew, telling the young ladies that they would find tea ready\r\nwhen they came down.\r\n\r\n"How very handsome Hester is!" was the exclamation of both mother and\r\ndaughter, when Sophia had shut the drawing-room door behind her.\r\n\r\n"I wonder," said Mrs Grey, "that nobody ever told us how handsome we\r\nshould find Hester.  I should like to see what fault Mrs Rowland can\r\nfind in her face."\r\n\r\n"It is rather odd that one sister should have all the beauty," said\r\nSophia.  "I do not see anything striking in Margaret."\r\n\r\n"Mrs Rowland will say she is plain; but, in my opinion, Margaret is\r\nbetter looking than any of the Rowlands are ever likely to be.  Margaret\r\nwould not be thought plain away from her sister.--I hope they are not\r\nfine ladies.  I am rather surprised at their bringing a maid.  She looks\r\na very respectable person; but I did not suppose they would keep a maid\r\ntill they knew better what to look forward to.  I do not know what Mr\r\nGrey will think of it."\r\n\r\nWhen Hester and Margaret came down, Mrs Grey was ready with an account\r\nof the society of the place.\r\n\r\n"We are as well off for society," said she, "as most places of the size.\r\nIf you were to ask the bookseller at Blickley, who supplies our club,\r\nhe would tell you that we are rather intellectual people: and I hope you\r\nwill see, when our friends have called on you, that though we seem to be\r\nliving out of the world, we are not without our pleasures.  I think,\r\nSophia, the Levitts will certainly call."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, mamma, to-morrow, I have no doubt."\r\n\r\n"Dr Levitt is our rector," observed Mrs Grey to her guests.  "We are\r\ndissenters, as you know, and our neighbour, Mrs Rowland, is very much\r\nscandalised at it.  If Mr Rowland would have allowed it, she would have\r\nmade a difficulty on that ground about having her children educated with\r\nmine.  But the Levitts\' conduct might teach her better.  They make no\r\ndifference on account of our being dissenters.  They always call on our\r\nfriends the first day after they arrive,--or the second, at furthest.  I\r\nhave no doubt we shall see the Levitts to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"And Mrs Enderby, I am sure," said Sophia, "if she is at all able to\r\nstir out."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, Mrs Enderby knows what is right, if her daughter does not.\r\nIf she does not call to-morrow, I shall think that Mrs Rowland\r\nprevented her.  She can keep her mother within doors, as we know, when\r\nit suits her purposes."\r\n\r\n"But Mr Philip is here, mamma, and Mrs Enderby can do as she likes\r\nwhen she has her son with her.--I assure you he is here, mamma.  I saw\r\nthe cobbler\'s boy carry home a pair of boots there this morning."\r\n\r\nSydney had better evidence still to produce.  Mr Enderby had been\r\ntalking with him about fishing this afternoon.  He said he had come down\r\nfor a fortnight\'s fishing.  Fanny also declared that Matilda Rowland had\r\ntold Miss Young to-day, that uncle Philip was coming to see the new\r\nschoolroom.  Mrs Grey was always glad, on poor Mrs Enderby\'s account,\r\nwhen she had her son with her: but otherwise she owned she did not care\r\nfor his coming.  He was too like his sister to please her.\r\n\r\n"He is very high, to be sure," observed Sophia.\r\n\r\n"And really there is no occasion for that with us," resumed Mrs Grey.\r\n"We should never think of mixing him up with his sister\'s proceedings,\r\nif he did not do it himself.  No one would suppose him answerable for\r\nher rudeness; at least, I am sure such a thing would never enter my\r\nhead.  But he forces it upon one\'s mind by carrying himself so high."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think he can help being so tall," observed Sydney.\r\n\r\n"But he buttons up, and makes the most of it," replied Sophia.  "He\r\nstalks in like a Polish count."\r\n\r\nThe sisters could not help smiling at this proof that the incursions of\r\nthe Poles into this place were confined to the book club.  They happened\r\nto be well acquainted with a Polish count, who was short of stature and\r\ndid not stalk.  They were spared all necessity of exerting themselves in\r\nconversation, for it went on very well without the aid of more than a\r\nword or two from them.\r\n\r\n"Do you think, mamma, the Andersons will come?" asked Sophia.\r\n\r\n"Not before Sunday, my dear.  The Andersons live three miles off," she\r\nexplained, "and are much confined by their school.  They may possibly\r\ncall on Saturday afternoon, as Saturday is a half-holiday; but Sunday\r\nafter church is a more likely time.--We do not much approve of Sunday\r\nvisits; and I dare say you feel the same: but this is a particular\r\ncase,--people living three miles off, you know, and keeping a school.\r\nAnd being dissenters, we do not like to appear illiberal to those who\r\nare not of our own way of thinking: so the Andersons sometimes come in\r\nafter church; and I am sure you will accept their call just as if it was\r\nmade in any other way."\r\n\r\nHester and Margaret could only say that they should be happy to see Mr\r\nand Mrs Anderson in any mode which was most convenient to themselves.\r\nA laugh went through the family, and a general exclamation of "Mr and\r\nMrs Anderson!"  "The Andersons" happened to be two maiden sisters, who\r\nkept a young ladies\' school.  It was some time before Mrs Grey herself\r\ncould so far command her countenance as to frown with becoming severity\r\nat Fanny, who continued to giggle for some time, with intervals of\r\nconvulsive stillness, at the idea that "the Andersons" could mean Mr\r\nand Mrs Anderson.  In the midst of the struggle, Mr Grey entered.  He\r\nlaid a hand on the head of each twin, observed that they seemed very\r\nmerry, and asked whether his cousins had been kind enough to make them\r\nlaugh already.  To these cousins he offered a brief and hearty welcome,\r\nremarking that he supposed they had been told what had prevented his\r\nbeing on the spot on their arrival, and that he need not trouble them\r\nwith the story over again.\r\n\r\nSydney had slipped out as his father entered, for the chance of riding\r\nhis horse to the stable,--a ride of any length being in his opinion\r\nbetter than none.  When he returned in a few minutes, he tried to\r\nwhisper to Sophia, over the back of her chair, but could not for\r\nlaughing.  After repeated attempts, Sophia pushed him away.\r\n\r\n"Come, my boy, out with it!" said his father.  "What you can tell your\r\nsister you can tell us.  What is the joke?"\r\n\r\nSydney looked as if he had rather not explain before the strangers; but\r\nhe never dared to trifle with his father.  He had just heard from little\r\nGeorge Rowland, that Mrs Rowland had said at home, that the young\r\nladies at Mr Grey\'s, who had been made so much fuss about, were not\r\n_young_ ladies, after all: she had seen the face of one, as they passed\r\nher in the chaise, and she was sure the person could not be less than\r\nfifty.\r\n\r\n"She saw Morris, no doubt," said Hester, amidst the general laugh.\r\n\r\n"I hope she will come to-morrow, and see some people who are very little\r\nlike fifty," said Mrs Grey.  "She will be surprised, I think," she\r\nadded, looking at Hester, with a very meaning manner of admiration.  "I\r\nreally hope, for her own sake, she will come, though you need not mind\r\nif she does not.  You will have no great loss.  Mr Grey, I suppose you\r\nthink she will call?"\r\n\r\n"No doubt, my dear.  Mrs Rowland never omits calling on our friends;\r\nand why should she now?"  And Mr Grey applied himself to conversation\r\nwith his cousins, while the rest of the family enjoyed further merriment\r\nabout Mrs Rowland having mistaken Morris for one of the Miss Ibbotsons.\r\n\r\nMr Grey showed a sympathy with the sisters, which made them more at\r\nhome than they had felt since they entered the house.  He knew some of\r\ntheir Birmingham friends, and could speak of the institutions and\r\ninterests of the town.  For a whole hour he engaged them in brisk\r\nconversation, without having once alluded to their private affairs or\r\nhis own, or said one word about Deerbrook society.  At the end of that\r\ntime, just as Mary and Fanny had received orders to go to bed, and were\r\nputting their dolls into the cradle in preparation, the scrambling of a\r\nhorse\'s feet was heard on the gravel before the front door, and the\r\nhouse-bell rang.\r\n\r\n"Who can be coming at this time of night?" said Mrs Grey.\r\n\r\n"It is Hope, I have no doubt," replied her husband.  "As I passed his\r\ndoor, I asked him to go out to old Mr Smithson, who seems to me to be\r\nrather worse than better, and to let me know whether anything can be\r\ndone for the old gentleman.  Hope has come to report of him, no doubt."\r\n\r\n"Oh, mamma, don\'t send us to bed if it is Mr Hope!" cried the little\r\ngirls.  "Let us sit up a little longer if it is Mr Hope."\r\n\r\n"Mr Hope is a great favourite with the children,--with us all,"\r\nobserved Mrs Grey to the sisters.  "We have the greatest confidence in\r\nhim as our medical man; as indeed every one has who employs him.  Mr\r\nGrey brought him here, and we consider him the greatest acquisition our\r\nsociety ever had."\r\n\r\nThe sisters could not be surprised, at this when they saw Mr Hope.  The\r\nonly wonder was, that, in the description of the intellectual society of\r\nDeerbrook, Mr Hope had not been mentioned first.  He was not handsome;\r\nbut there was a gaiety of countenance and manner in him, under which the\r\nvery lamp seemed to burn brighter.  He came, as Mr Grey had explained,\r\non business; and, not having been aware of the arrival of the strangers,\r\nwould have retreated when his errand was done; but, as opposition was\r\nmade to this by both parents and children he sat down for a quarter of\r\nan hour, to be taken into consultation about how the Miss Ibbotsons were\r\nto be conducted through the process of seeing the sights of Deerbrook.\r\n\r\nWith all sincerity, the sisters declared that the woods of the park\r\nwould fully satisfy them,--that they had been accustomed to a life so\r\nquiet, that excursions were not at all necessary to their enjoyment.\r\nMr Grey was determined that they should visit every place worth seeing\r\nin the neighbourhood, while it was in its summer beauty.  Mr Hope was\r\nexactly the right person to consult, as there was no nook, no hamlet, to\r\nwhich his tastes or his profession had not led him.  Sophia put paper\r\nbefore him, on which he was to note distances, according to his and Mr\r\nGrey\'s computations.  Now, it was one peculiarity of Mr Hope that he\r\ncould never see a piece of paper before him without drawing upon it.\r\nSophia\'s music-books, and any sheet of blotting-paper which might ever\r\nhave come in his way, bore tokens of this: and now his fingers were as\r\nbusy as usual while he was talking and computing and arranging.  When,\r\nas he said, enough had been planned to occupy a month, he threw down his\r\npencil, and took leave till the morning, when he intended to make a call\r\nwhich should be less involuntary.\r\n\r\nThe moment he was gone, the little girls laid hands on the sheet of\r\npaper, on which he had been employed.  As they expected, it was covered\r\nwith scraps of sketches; and they exclaimed with delight, "Look here!\r\nHere is the spring.  How fond Mr Hope is of drawing the spring!  And\r\nhere is the foot-bridge at Dingleford!  And what is this?  Here is a\r\nplace we don\'t know, papa."\r\n\r\n"I do not know how you should, my dears.  It is the Abbey ruin down the\r\nriver, which I rather think you have never seen."\r\n\r\n"No, but we should like to see it.  Are there no faces this time, Fanny?\r\nNone anywhere?  No funny faces this time!  I like them the best of Mr\r\nHope\'s drawings.  Sophia, do let us show some of the faces that are on\r\nyour music-books."\r\n\r\n"If you will be sure and put them away again.  But you know if Mr Hope\r\nis ever reminded of them, he will be sure to rub them out."\r\n\r\n"He did old Owen fishing so that he can\'t rub it out if he would," said\r\nSydney.  "He did it in ink for me; and that is better than any of your\r\nsketches, that will rub out in a minute."\r\n\r\n"Come, children," said their father, "it is an hour past your bedtime."\r\n\r\nWhen the children were gone, and Sophia was attending the sisters to\r\ntheir apartment, Mrs Grey looked at her husband over her spectacles.\r\n"Well, my dear!" said she.\r\n\r\n"Well, my dear!" responded Mr Grey.\r\n\r\n"Do not you think Hester very handsome?"\r\n\r\n"There is no doubt of it, my dear.  She is very handsome."\r\n\r\n"Do not you think Mr Hope thinks so too?"\r\n\r\nIt is a fact which few but the despisers of their race like to\r\nacknowledge, and which those despisers of their race are therefore apt\r\nto interpret wrongly, and are enabled to make too much of--that it is\r\nperfectly natural,--so natural as to appear necessary,--that when young\r\npeople first meet, the possibility of their falling in love should occur\r\nto all the minds present.  We have no doubt that it always is so; though\r\nwe are perfectly aware that the idea speedily goes out again, as\r\nnaturally as it came in: and in no case so speedily and naturally as in\r\nthe minds of the parties most nearly concerned, from the moment that the\r\nconcern becomes very near indeed.  We have no doubt that the minds in\r\nMr Grey\'s drawing-room underwent the common succession of ideas,--\r\nslight and transient imaginations, which pass into nothingness when\r\nunexpressed.  Probably the sisters wondered whether Mr Hope was\r\nmarried, whether he was engaged, whether he was meant for Sophia, in the\r\nprospect of her growing old enough.  Probably each speculated for half a\r\nmoment, unconsciously, for her sister, and Sophia for both.  Probably\r\nMr Grey might reflect that when young people are in the way of meeting\r\nfrequently in country excursions, a love affair is no very unnatural\r\nresult.  But Mrs Grey was the only one who fixed the idea in her own\r\nmind and another\'s by speaking of it.\r\n\r\n"Do not you think Mr Hope thinks Hester very handsome, Mr Grey?"\r\n\r\n"I really know nothing about it, my dear.  He did not speak on the\r\nsubject as he mounted his horse; and that is the only opportunity he has\r\nhad of saying anything about the young ladies."\r\n\r\n"It would have been strange if he had then, before Sydney and the\r\nservants."\r\n\r\n"Very strange indeed."\r\n\r\n"But do you not think he must have been struck with her?  I should like\r\nvery well to have her settled here; and the corner-house of Mr\r\nRowland\'s might do nicely for them.  I do not know what Mrs Rowland\r\nwould think of Mr Hope\'s marrying into our connection so decidedly."\r\n\r\n"My dear," said her husband, smiling, "just consider!  For anything we\r\nknow, these young ladies may both be attached and engaged.  Hope may be\r\nattached elsewhere--."\r\n\r\n"No; that I will answer for it he is not.  I--"\r\n\r\n"Well, you may have your reasons for being sure on that head.  But he\r\nmay not like the girls; they may not like him:--in short, the only thing\r\nthat has happened is, that they have seen each other for one quarter of\r\nan hour."\r\n\r\n"Well! there is no saying what may come of it."\r\n\r\n"Very true: let us wait and see."\r\n\r\n"But there is no harm in my telling you whatever comes into my head!"\r\n\r\n"None in the world, unless you get it so fixed there that somebody else\r\nhappens to know it too.  Be careful, my dear.  Let no one of these young\r\npeople get a glimpse of your speculation.  Think of the consequence to\r\nthem and to yourself."\r\n\r\n"Dear me, Mr Grey! you need not be afraid.  What a serious matter you\r\nmake of a word or two!"\r\n\r\n"Because a good many ideas belong to that word or two, my dear."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWO.\r\n\r\nMOONLIGHT TO TOWNSFOLK.\r\n\r\nThe moment the door closed behind Sophia, as she left the sisters in\r\ntheir apartment, Hester crossed the room with a step very like a dance,\r\nand threw up the window.\r\n\r\n"I had rather look out than sleep," said she.  "I shall be ashamed to\r\nclose my eyes on such a prospect.  Morris, if you are waiting for us,\r\nyou may go.  I shall sit up a long while yet."\r\n\r\nMorris thought she had not seen Hester in such spirits since her\r\nfather\'s death.  She was unwilling to check them, but said something\r\nabout the fatigues of the journey, and being fresh for the next day.\r\n\r\n"No fear for to-morrow, Morris.  We are in the country, you know, and I\r\ncannot fancy being tired in the fields, and in such a park as that.\r\nGood-night, Morris."\r\n\r\nWhen she too was gone, Hester called Margaret to her, put her arm round\r\nher waist, and kissed her again and again.\r\n\r\n"You seem happy to-night, Hester," said Margaret\'s gentle voice.\r\n\r\n"Yes," sighed Hester; "more like being happy than for a long time past.\r\nHow little we know what we shall feel!  Here have I been dreading and\r\ndreading this evening, and shrinking from the idea of meeting the Greys,\r\nand wanting to write at the last moment to say that we would not come;--\r\nand it turns out--Oh, so differently!  Think of day after day, week\r\nafter week of pure country life!  When they were planning for us\r\nto-night, and talking of the brook, and lanes, and meadows, it made my\r\nvery heart dance."\r\n\r\n"Thank God!" said Margaret.  "When your heart dances, there is nothing\r\nleft to wish."\r\n\r\n"But did not yours?  Had you ever such a prospect before,--such a\r\nprospect of delicious pleasure for weeks together,--except perhaps when\r\nwe caught our first sight of the sea?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing can ever equal that," replied Margaret.  "Do not you hear now\r\nthe shout we gave when we saw the sparkles on the horizon,--heaving\r\nsparkles,--when we were a mile off, and mamma held me up that I might\r\nsee it better; and baby,--dear baby,--clapped his little hands?  Does it\r\nnot seem like yesterday?"\r\n\r\n"Like yesterday: and yet, if baby had lived, he would now have been our\r\ncompanion, taking the place of all other friends to us.  I thought of\r\nhim when I saw Sydney Grey; but he would have been very unlike Sydney\r\nGrey.  He would have been five years older, but still different from\r\nwhat Sydney will be at eighteen--graver, more manly."\r\n\r\n"How strange is the idea of having a brother!" said Margaret.  "I never\r\nsee girls with their brothers but I watch them, and long to feel what it\r\nis, just for one hour.  I wonder what difference it would have made\r\nbetween you and me, if we had had a brother."\r\n\r\n"You and he would have been close friends--always together, and I should\r\nhave been left alone," said Hester, with a sigh.  "Oh, yes," she\r\ncontinued, interrupting Margaret\'s protest, "it would have been so.\r\nThere can never be the same friendship between three as between two."\r\n\r\n"And why should you have been the one left out?" asked Margaret.  "But\r\nthis is all nonsense--all a dream," she added.  "The reality is that\r\nbaby died--still a baby--and we know no more of what he would have been,\r\nthan of what he is.  The real truth is, that you and I are alone, to be\r\neach other\'s only friend."\r\n\r\n"It makes me tremble to think of it, Margaret.  It is not so long since\r\nour home seemed full.  How we used all to sit round the fire, and laugh\r\nand play with papa, as if we were not to separate till we had all grown\r\nold: and now, young as we are, here we are alone!  How do we know that\r\nwe shall be left to each other?"\r\n\r\n"There is only one thing we can do, Hester," said Margaret, resting her\r\nhead on her sister\'s shoulder.  "We must make the most of being together\r\nwhile we can.  There must not be the shadow of a cloud between us for a\r\nmoment.  Our confidence must be as full and free, our whole minds as\r\nabsolutely open, as--as I have read and heard that two minds can never\r\nbe."\r\n\r\n"Those who say so do not know what may be," exclaimed Hester.  "I am\r\nsure there is not a thought, a feeling in me, that I could not tell you,\r\nthough I know I never could to any one else."\r\n\r\n"If I were to lose you, Hester, there are many, many things that would\r\nbe shut up in me for ever.  There will never be any one on earth to whom\r\nI could say the things that I can tell to you.  Do you believe this,\r\nHester?"\r\n\r\n"I do.  I know it."\r\n\r\n"Then you will never again doubt me, as you certainly have done\r\nsometimes.  You cannot imagine how my heart sinks when I see you are\r\nfancying that I care for somebody else more than for you; when you think\r\nthat I am feeling differently from you.  Oh, Hester, I know every change\r\nof your thoughts by your face; and indeed your thoughts have been\r\nmistaken sometimes."\r\n\r\n"They have been wicked, often," said Hester, in a low voice.  "I have\r\nsometimes thought that I must be hopelessly bad, when I have found that\r\nthe strongest affection I have in the world has made me unjust and cruel\r\nto the person I love best.  I have a jealous temper, Margaret; and a\r\njealous temper is a wicked temper."\r\n\r\n"Now you are unkind to yourself, Hester.  I do believe you will never\r\ndoubt me again."\r\n\r\n"I never will.  And if I find a thought of the kind rising in me, I will\r\ntell you the moment I am aware of it."\r\n\r\n"Do, and I will tell you the moment I see a trace of such a thought in\r\nyour face.  So we shall be safe.  We can never misunderstand each other\r\nfor more than a moment."\r\n\r\nBy the gentle leave of Heaven, all human beings have visions.  Not the\r\nlowest and dullest but has the coarseness of his life relieved at\r\nmoments by some scenery of hope rising through the brooding fogs of his\r\nintellect and his heart.  Such visitations of mercy are the privilege of\r\nthe innocent, and the support of the infirm.  Here were the lonely\r\nsisters sustained in bereavement and self-rebuke, by the vision of a\r\nfriendship which should be unearthly in its depth and freedom; they were\r\nso happy for the hour, that nothing could disturb them.\r\n\r\n"I do not see," observed Hester, "that it will be possible to enjoy any\r\nintimate intercourse with this family.  Unless they are of a different\r\norder from what they seem, we cannot have much in common; but I am sure\r\nthey mean to be kind, and they will let us be happy in our own way.  Oh,\r\nwhat mornings you and I will have together in those woods!  Did you ever\r\nsee anything so soft as they look--in this light?"\r\n\r\n"And the bend of the river glittering there!  Here, a little more this\r\nway, and you will see it as I do.  The moon is not at the full yet; the\r\nriver will be like this for some nights to come."\r\n\r\n"And these rides and drives,--I hope nothing will prevent our going\r\nthrough the whole list of them.  What is the matter, Margaret?  Why are\r\nyou so cool about them?"\r\n\r\n"I think all the pleasure depends upon the companionship, and I have\r\nsome doubts about that.  I had rather sit at work in a drawing-room all\r\nday, than go among mountains with people--"\r\n\r\n"Like the Mansons; Oh, that spreading of shawls, and bustle about the\r\nsandwiches, before they could give a look at the waterfall!  I am afraid\r\nwe may find something of the same drawback here."\r\n\r\n"I am afraid so."\r\n\r\n"Well, only let us get out into the woods and lanes, and we will manage\r\nto enjoy ourselves there.  We can contrive to digress here and there\r\ntogether without being missed.  But I think we are judging rather\r\nhastily from what we saw this evening even about this family; and we\r\nhave no right to suppose that all their acquaintance are like them."\r\n\r\n"No, indeed; and I am sure Mr Hope, for one, is of a different order.\r\nHe dropped one thing, one little saying, which proved this to my mind."\r\n\r\n"I know what you mean--about the old man that is to be our guide over\r\nthat heath they were talking of--about why that heath is a different and\r\nmore beautiful place to him than to us, or to his former self.  Is it\r\nnot true, what he said?"\r\n\r\n"I am sure it is true.  I have little to say of my own experience, or\r\nwisdom, or goodness, whichever it was that he particularly meant as\r\ngiving a new power of sight to the old man; but I know that no tree\r\nwaves to my eye as it did ten years ago, and the music of running water\r\nis richer to my ear as every summer comes round."\r\n\r\n"Yes; I almost wonder sometimes whether all things are not made at the\r\nmoment by the mind that sees them, so wonderfully do they change with\r\none\'s mood, and according to the store of thoughts they lay open in\r\none\'s mind.  If I lived in a desert island (supposing one\'s intellect\r\ncould go on to grow there), I should feel sure of this."\r\n\r\n"But not here, where it is quite clear that the village sot (if there be\r\none), and Mr Hope, and the children, and we ourselves all see the same\r\nobjects in sunlight and moonlight, and acknowledge them to be the same,\r\nthough we cannot measure feelings upon them.  I wish Mr Hope may say\r\nsomething more which may lead to the old man on the heath again.  He is\r\ncoming to-morrow morning."\r\n\r\n"Yes; we shall see him again to-morrow."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THREE.\r\n\r\nMAKING ACQUAINTANCE.\r\n\r\nThe sisters were not so fatigued with their journey but that they were\r\nearly in the open air the next morning.  In the shrubbery they met the\r\ntwins, walking hand in hand, each with a doll on the disengaged arm.\r\n\r\n"You are giving your dolls an airing before breakfast," said Hester,\r\nstopping them as they would have passed on.\r\n\r\n"Yes; we carry out our dolls now because we must not run before\r\nbreakfast.  We have made arbours in our own gardens for our dolls, where\r\nthey may sit when we are swinging."\r\n\r\n"I should like to see your arbours and your gardens," said Margaret,\r\nlooking round her.  "Will you take me to them?"\r\n\r\n"Not now," answered they; "we should have to cross the grass, and we\r\nmust not go upon the grass before breakfast."\r\n\r\n"Where is your swing?  I am very fond of swinging."\r\n\r\n"Oh! it is in the orchard there, under that large tree.  But you\r\ncannot--"\r\n\r\n"I see; we cannot get to it now, because we should have to cross the\r\ngrass."  And Margaret began to look round for any place where they might\r\ngo beyond the gravel-walk, on which they stood.  She moved towards the\r\ngreenhouse, but found it was never unlocked before breakfast.  The\r\nsummerhouse remained, and a most unexceptionable path led to it.  The\r\nsisters turned that way.\r\n\r\n"You cannot go there," cried the children; "Miss Young always has the\r\nschoolroom before breakfast."\r\n\r\n"We are going to see Miss Young," explained Hester, smiling at the\r\namazed faces with which the children stared from the end of the path.\r\nThey were suddenly seen to turn, and walk as fast as they could, without\r\nits being called running, towards the house.  They were gone to their\r\nmother\'s dressing-room door, to tell her that the Miss Ibbotsons were\r\ngone to see Miss Young before breakfast.\r\n\r\nThe path led for some little way under the hedge which separated Mr\r\nGrey\'s from Mr Rowland\'s garden.  There were voices on the other side,\r\nand what was said was perfectly audible.  Uneasy at hearing what was not\r\nmeant for them, Hester and Margaret gave tokens of their presence.  The\r\nconversation on the other side of the hedge proceeded; and in a very\r\nshort time the sisters were persuaded that they had been mistaken in\r\nsupposing that what was said was not meant for them.\r\n\r\n"My own Matilda," said a voice, which evidently came from under a lady\'s\r\nbonnet which moved parallel with Hester\'s and Margaret\'s; "My own\r\nMatilda, I would not be so harsh as to prevent your playing where you\r\nplease before breakfast.  Run where you like, my love.  I am sorry for\r\nlittle girls who are not allowed to do as they please in the cool of the\r\nmorning.  My children shall never suffer such restriction."\r\n\r\n"Mother," cried a rough little person, "I\'m going fishing with Uncle\r\nPhilip to-day.  Sydney Grey and I are going, I don\'t know how far up the\r\nriver."\r\n\r\n"On no account, my dear boy.  You must not think of such a thing.  I\r\nshould not have a moment\'s peace while you are away.  You would not be\r\nback till evening, perhaps; and I should be fancying all day that you\r\nwere in the river.  It is out of the question, my own George."\r\n\r\n"But I must go, mother.  Uncle Philip said I might; and Sydney Grey is\r\ngoing."\r\n\r\n"That is only another reason, my dear boy.  Your uncle will yield to my\r\nwishes, I am sure, as he always does.  And if Mrs Grey allows her son\r\nto run such risks, I am sure I should not feel myself justified.  You\r\nwill stay with me, love, won\'t you?  You will stay with your mother, my\r\nown boy."\r\n\r\nGeorge ran roaring away, screaming for Uncle Philip; who was not at\r\nhand, however, to plead his cause.\r\n\r\n"My Matilda," resumed the fond mother, "you are making yourself a sad\r\nfigure.  You will not be fit to show yourself at breakfast.  Do you\r\nsuppose your papa ever saw such a frock as that?  There! look--dripping\r\nwet!  Pritchard, take Miss Matilda, and change all her clothes directly.\r\nSo much for my allowing her to run on the grass while the dew is on!\r\nLose no time, Pritchard, lest the child should catch cold.  Leave Miss\r\nAnna with me.  Walk beside me, my Anna.  Ah! there is papa.  Papa, we\r\nmust find some amusement for George today, as I cannot think of letting\r\nhim go out fishing.  Suppose we take the children to spend the morning\r\nwith their cousins at Dingleford?"\r\n\r\n"To-morrow would suit me better, my love," replied the husband.  "Indeed\r\nI don\'t see how I can go to-day, or you either."  And Mr Rowland\r\nlowered his voice, so as to show that he was aware of his liability to\r\nbe overheard.\r\n\r\n"Oh, as to that, there is no hurry," replied the lady, aloud.  "If I had\r\nnothing else to do, I should not make that call to-day.  Any day will do\r\nas well."\r\n\r\nAs Hester and Margaret looked at each other, they heard the gentleman\r\nsoftly say "Hush!"  But Mrs Rowland went on as audibly as ever.\r\n\r\n"There is no reason why I should be in any hurry to call on Mrs Grey\'s\r\nfriends, whoever and whatever they may be.  Any day will do for that, my\r\ndear."\r\n\r\nNot having been yet forbidden to run before breakfast, Hester and\r\nMargaret fled to the summer-house, to avoid hearing any more of the\r\ndomestic dialogues of the Rowland family.\r\n\r\n"What shall we do when that woman calls?" said Hester.  "How will it be\r\npossible to speak to her?"\r\n\r\n"As we should speak to any other indifferent person," replied Margaret.\r\n"Her rudeness is meant for Mrs Grey, not for us; for she knows nothing\r\nabout us: and Mrs Grey will never hear from us what has passed.--Shall\r\nwe knock?"\r\n\r\nIn answer to the knock, they were requested to enter.  Miss Young rose\r\nin some confusion when she found her visitors were other than her\r\npupils: but she was so lame that Hester made her sit down again, while\r\nthey drew seats for themselves.  They apologised for breaking in upon\r\nher with so little ceremony, but explained that they were come to be\r\ninmates at Mr Grey\'s for some months, and that they wished to lose no\r\ntime in making themselves acquainted with every resort of the family, of\r\nwhich they considered themselves a part.  Miss Young was evidently\r\npleased to see them.  She closed her volume, and assured them they were\r\nwelcome to her apartment; "For," said she, "everybody calls it my\r\napartment, and why should not I?"\r\n\r\n"Do you spend all your time here?" asked Hester.\r\n\r\n"Almost the whole day.  I have a lodging in the village; but I leave it\r\nearly these fine mornings, and stay here till dark.  I am so lame as to\r\nmake it inconvenient to pass over the ground oftener than is necessary;\r\nand I find it pleasanter to see trees and grass through every window\r\nhere, than to look out into the farrier\'s yard,--the only prospect from\r\nmy lodging.  The furnace and sparks are pretty enough on a winter\'s\r\nevening, especially when one is too ill or too dismal to do anything but\r\nwatch them; but at this season one grows tired of old horse-shoes and\r\ncinders; and so I sit here."\r\n\r\nTo the sisters there seemed a world of desolation in these words.  They\r\nwere always mourning for having no brother.  Here was one who appeared\r\nto be entirely alone.  From not knowing exactly what to say, Margaret\r\nopened the book Miss Young had laid aside.  It was German--Schiller\'s\r\nThirty Years\' War.  Every one has something to say about German\r\nliterature; those who do not understand it asking whether it is not very\r\nmystical, and wild, and obscure; and those who do understand it saying\r\nthat it is not so at all.  It would be a welcome novelty if the two\r\nparties were to set about finding out what it is to be mystical,--a\r\npoint which, for aught that is known to the generality, is not yet\r\nascertained.  Miss Young and her visitors did not enter upon precise\r\ndefinitions this morning.  These were left for a future occasion.\r\nMeantime it was ascertained that Miss Young had learned the German\r\nlanguage by the aid of dictionary and grammar alone, and also that if\r\nshe should happen to meet with any one who wished to enjoy what she was\r\nenjoying, she should be glad to afford any aid in her power.  Hester was\r\nsatisfied with thanking her.  She was old enough to know that learning a\r\nnew language is a serious undertaking.  Margaret was somewhat younger,\r\nand ready for any enterprise.  She thought she saw before her hours of\r\nlong mornings, when she should be glad to escape from the work-table to\r\nMiss Young\'s companionship and to study.  The bright field of German\r\nliterature seemed to open before her to be explored.  She warmly thanked\r\nMiss Young, and accepted her offered assistance.\r\n\r\n"So you spend all your days alone here," said she, looking round upon\r\nthe rather bare walls, the matted floor, the children\'s desks, and the\r\nsingle shelf which held Miss Young\'s books.\r\n\r\n"Not exactly all the day alone," replied Miss Young; "the children are\r\nwith me five hours a day, and a set of pupils from the village comes to\r\nme besides, for a spare hour of the afternoon.  In this way I see a good\r\nmany little faces every day."\r\n\r\n"And some others too, I should hope; some besides little faces?"\r\n\r\nMiss Young was silent.  Margaret hastened on--\r\n\r\n"I suppose most people would say here what is said everywhere else about\r\nthe nobleness and privilege of the task of teaching children.  But I do\r\nnot envy those who have it to do.  I am as fond of children as any one;\r\nbut then it is having them out to play on the grass, or romping with\r\nthem in the nursery, that I like.  When it becomes a matter of desks and\r\nschool-books, I had far rather study than teach."\r\n\r\n"I believe everybody, except perhaps mothers, would agree with you,"\r\nsaid Miss Young, who was now, without apology, plying her needle.\r\n\r\n"Indeed! then I am very sorry for you."\r\n\r\n"Thank you; but there\'s no need to be sorry for me.  Do you suppose that\r\none\'s comfort lies in having a choice of employments?  My experience\r\nleads me to think the contrary."\r\n\r\n"I do not think I could be happy," said Hester, "to be tied down to an\r\nemployment I did not like."\r\n\r\n"Not to a positively disgusting one.  But I am disposed to think that\r\nthe greatest number of happy people may be found busy in employments\r\nthat they have not chosen for themselves, and never would have chosen."\r\n\r\n"I am afraid these very happy people are haunted by longings to be doing\r\nsomething else."\r\n\r\n"Yes: there is their great trouble.  They think, till experience makes\r\nthem wiser, that if they were only in another set of circumstances, if\r\nthey only had a choice what they would do, a chance for the exercise of\r\nthe powers they are conscious of, they would do such things as should be\r\nthe wonder and the terror of the earth.  But their powers may be\r\ndoubted, if they do not appear in the conquest of circumstances."\r\n\r\n"So you conquer these giddy children, when you had rather be conquering\r\nGerman metaphysicians, or ---, or ---, what else?"\r\n\r\n"There is little to conquer in these children," said Miss Young; "they\r\nare very good with me.  I assure you I have much more to conquer in\r\nmyself, with regard to them.  It is but little that I can do for them;\r\nand that little I am apt to despise, in the vain desire to do more."\r\n\r\n"How more?"\r\n\r\n"If I had them in a house by myself, to spend their whole time with me,\r\nso that I could educate, instead of merely teaching them.  But here I am\r\ndoing just what we were talking of just now,--laying out a\r\npretty-looking field of duty, in which there would probably be as many\r\nthorns as in any other.  Teaching has its pleasures,--its great\r\noccasional, and small daily pleasures, though they are not to be\r\ncompared to the sublime delights of education."\r\n\r\n"You must have some of these sublime delights mixed in with the humbler.\r\nYou are, in some degree, educating these children while teaching them."\r\n\r\n"Yes: but it is more a negative than a positive function, a very humble\r\none.  Governesses to children at home can do little more than stand\r\nbetween children and the faults of the people about them.  I speak quite\r\ngenerally."\r\n\r\n"Is such an occupation one in which anybody can be happy?"\r\n\r\n"Why not, as well as in making pins\' heads, or in nursing sick people,\r\nor in cutting square blocks out of a chalk pit for thirty years\r\ntogether, or in any other occupation which may be ordained to prove to\r\nus that happiness lies in the temper, and not in the object of a\r\npursuit?  Are there not free and happy pin-makers, and sick-nurses, and\r\nchalk-cutters?"\r\n\r\n"Yes: but they know how much to expect.  They have no idea of pin-making\r\nin itself being great happiness."\r\n\r\n"Just so.  Well: let a governess learn what to expect; set her free from\r\na hankering after happiness in her work, and you have a happy\r\ngoverness."\r\n\r\n"I thought such a thing was out of the order of nature."\r\n\r\n"Not quite.  There have been such, though there are strong influences\r\nagainst it.  The expectations of all parties are unreasonable; and those\r\nwho are too humble, or too amiable, to be dissatisfied with others, are\r\ndiscontented with themselves, when the inevitable disappointment comes.\r\nThere is a great deal said about the evils of the position of a\r\ngoverness--between the family and the servants--a great deal said that\r\nis very true, and always will be true, while governesses have proud\r\nhearts, like other people: but these are slight evils in comparison with\r\nthe grand one of the common failure of the relation.--There! do you hear\r\nthat bell?"\r\n\r\n"What is it?  The breakfast bell?"\r\n\r\n"Yes.  You must go.  I would not be understood as inviting you here; for\r\nit is not, except upon sufferance, my room; and I have no inducement to\r\noffer.  But I may just say, that you will always be welcome."\r\n\r\n"Always?" said Margaret.  "In and out of school hours?"\r\n\r\n"In and out of school hours, unless your presence should chance to turn\r\nmy pupils\' heads.  In that case, you will not be offended if I ask you\r\nto go away."\r\n\r\nMary and Fanny had just reported in the breakfast-parlour, that the Miss\r\nIbbotsons had been "such a time with Miss Young!" when Hester and\r\nMargaret entered.  The testimony there was all in favour of Miss Young.\r\nMr Grey called her a most estimable young woman; and Mrs Grey declared\r\nthat, though she could not agree with her on all points, and decidedly\r\nthought that she overrated Matilda Rowland\'s talents, she was convinced\r\nthat her children enjoyed great advantages under her care.  Sophia\r\nadded, that she was very superior,--quite learned.  Mrs Grey further\r\nexplained that, though now so much at ease on the subject of her\r\ndaughters\' education, no one could have an idea of the trouble she had\r\nhad in getting the plan arranged.  It had seemed a pity that the\r\nRowlands and her children should not learn together: it was such an\r\nadvantage for children to learn together!  But Mrs Rowland had made a\r\nthousand difficulties.  After breakfast, she would show her young\r\nfriends the room which she had proposed should be the schoolroom,--as\r\nairy and advantageous in every way as could be imagined: but Mrs\r\nRowland had objected that she could not have Matilda and George come out\r\nin all weathers,--as if they would have had to walk a mile, instead of\r\njust the sweep of the gravel-walk!  Mrs Rowland had proposed that her\r\nback-parlour should be the schoolroom: but really it was not to be\r\nthought of--so small and close, and such a dull room for Miss Young!\r\nThe gentlemen had been obliged to take it up at last.  Nobody could ever\r\nfind out which of them it was that had thought of the summerhouse,\r\nthough she was satisfied in her own mind that Mr Rowland was not in the\r\nhabit of having such clever ideas; but, however, it was soon settled.\r\nThe summer-house was so exactly on the boundary-line between the two\r\ngardens, that really no objection had been left for Mrs Rowland to\r\nmake.  She came as near to it as she could, however; for she had had the\r\nwalk covered in at great expense from her garden door to the\r\nsummer-house, when everybody knew she did not mind her children getting\r\nwet at other times on the grass before the dew was off.\r\n\r\n"And the covered way is quite an eyesore from the drawing-room windows,"\r\nadded Sophia.\r\n\r\n"Quite," said Mrs Grey; "and it can be seen from ours, as I dare say\r\nyou observed last night.  But I have no doubt that entered into her\r\ncalculations when she had it made."\r\n\r\nMr Grey inquired about the arrangements for the morning, and whether he\r\ncould be of any service.  It happened to be a leisure morning with him,\r\nand he did not know when he might have another at command.  Sophia\r\nreminded her father that it would be impossible for the ladies of the\r\nfamily to go out, when they were expecting the neighbours to call: and\r\nthis brought on another speculation as to who would call,--and\r\nespecially when the Rowlands might be looked for.  Hester and Margaret\r\nbelieved they could have settled this matter; but they forbore to speak\r\nof what they had overheard.  They began to wonder whether the subject of\r\nMrs Rowland was to be served up with every meal, for a continuance; and\r\nHester found her anticipations of delight in a country life somewhat\r\ndamped, by the idea of the frowning ghost of the obnoxious lady being\r\nfor ever present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOUR.\r\n\r\nMORNING CALLS.\r\n\r\nThe little girls had been dismissed to the schoolroom before Mr Grey\r\nhad finally pushed away his tea-cup.  Not being wanted by the ladies, he\r\nwalked off to his timber-yard, and his wife followed to ask him some\r\nquestion not intended for the general ear.  Sophia was struck with a\r\nsudden panic at being left alone with the strangers, and escaped by\r\nanother door into the store-room.  As the last traces of the breakfast\r\nthings vanished, Hester exclaimed--\r\n\r\n"So we may please ourselves, it seems, as to what we are to do with our\r\nmorning!"\r\n\r\n"I hope so," said Margaret.  "Do let us get down to the meadow we see\r\nfrom our window--the meadow that looks so flat and green!  We may very\r\nwell take two hours\' grace before we need sit down here in form and\r\norder."\r\n\r\nHester was willing, and the bonnets were soon on.  As Margaret was\r\npassing down stairs again, she saw Mrs Grey and Sophia whispering in a\r\nroom, the door of which stood open.  She heard it shut instantly, and\r\nthe result of the consultation soon appeared.  Just as the sisters were\r\nturning out of the house, Sophia ran after them to say that mamma wished\r\nthey would be so good as to defer their walk; mamma was afraid that if\r\nthey were seen abroad in the village, it would be supposed that they did\r\nnot wish to receive visitors: mamma would rather that they should stay\r\nwithin this morning.  There was nothing for it but to turn back; and\r\nHester threw down her bonnet with no very good grace, as she observed to\r\nher sister that, to all appearance, a town life was more free than a\r\ncountry one, after all.\r\n\r\n"Let us do our duty fully this first morning," said Margaret.  "Look, I\r\nam going to carry down my work-bag; and you shall see me sit on the same\r\nchair from this hour till dinner-time, unless I receive directions to\r\nthe contrary."\r\n\r\nThe restraint did not amount to this.  Hester\'s chair was placed\r\nopposite to Mrs Grey, who seemed to have pleasure in gazing at her, and\r\nin indulging in audible hints and visible winks and nods about her\r\nbeauty, to every lady visitor who sat near her.  Margaret might place\r\nherself where she pleased.  In the intervals of the visits of the\r\nmorning, she was treated with a diversity of entertainments by Sophia,\r\nwho occasionally summoned her to the window to see how Matilda Rowland\r\nwas allowed to run across the road to her grandmamma\'s, without so much\r\nas a hat upon her head,--to see Jim Bird, the oldest man in the parish\r\n(believed to be near a hundred), who was resting himself on the bank of\r\nthe hedge,--to see the peacock which had been sent as a present from Sir\r\nWilliam Hunter to Mr James, the lawyer, and which was a great nuisance\r\nfrom its screaming,--to say whether the two little Reeves, dropping\r\ntheir curtseys as they went home from school, were not little\r\nbeauties,--and, in short, to witness all the village spectacles which\r\npresent themselves before the windows of an acute observer on a fine\r\nspring morning.  The young ladies had to return to their seats as often\r\nas wheels were heard, or the approach of parasols was discerned.\r\n\r\nAmong the earliest visitors were Mrs Enderby and her redoubtable son,\r\nMr Philip.  Mrs Enderby was a bright-eyed, brisk, little old lady, who\r\nwas rather apt to talk herself quite out of breath, but who had\r\nevidently a stronger tendency still; and that was, to look on the bright\r\nside of everything and everybody.  She smiled smiles full of meaning and\r\nassent in return for Mrs Grey\'s winks about Hester\'s beauty; and really\r\ncheered Hester with accounts of how good everybody was at Deerbrook.\r\nShe was thankful that her maid Phoebe was better; she knew that Mrs\r\nGrey would not fail to inquire; really Phoebe was very much better; the\r\ninfluenza had left sad effects, but they were dispersing.  It would be a\r\npity the girl should not quite recover, for she was a most invaluable\r\nservant--such a servant as is very rarely to be met with.  The credit of\r\nrestoring her belonged to Mr Hope, who indeed had done everything.  She\r\nsupposed the ladies would soon be seeing Mr Hope.  He was extremely\r\nbusy, as everybody knew--had very large practice now; but he always\r\ncontrived to find time for everything.  It was exceedingly difficult to\r\nfind time for everything.  There was her dear daughter, Priscilla (Mrs\r\nRowland, whose husband was Mr Grey\'s partner); Priscilla devoted her\r\nlife to her children (and dear children they were); and no one who knew\r\nwhat she did for her children would expect anything more from her; but,\r\nindeed, those who knew best, she herself, for instance, were fully\r\nsatisfied that her dear Priscilla did wonders.  The apology for Mrs\r\nRowland, in case she should not call, was made not without ingenuity.\r\nHester fully understood it; and Mrs Grey showed by her bridling that it\r\nwas not lost upon her either.\r\n\r\nMr Enderby, meanwhile, was behaving civilly to Margaret and Sophia;\r\nthat is to say, he was somewhat more than merely civil to Margaret, and\r\nsomewhat less to Sophia.  It was obviously not without reason that\r\nSophia had complained of his hauteur.  He could not, as Sydney had\r\npleaded, help being tall; but he might have helped the excessive\r\nfrigidity with which he stood upright till invited to sit down.  The\r\nfact was, that he had reason to believe that the ladies of Mr Grey\'s\r\nfamily made very free with his sister\'s name and affairs; and though he\r\nwould have been sorry to have been obliged to defend all she said and\r\ndid, he felt some very natural emotions of dislike towards those who\r\nwere always putting the worst construction upon the whole of her\r\nconduct.  He believed that Mr Grey\'s influence was exerted on behalf of\r\npeace and good understanding, and he thought he perceived that Sydney,\r\nwith the shrewdness which some boys show very early, was more or less\r\nsensible of the absurdity of the feud between the partners\' wives and\r\ndaughters; and towards these members of the Grey family, Mr Enderby\r\nfelt nothing but good-will; he talked politics with Mr Grey in the\r\nshrubbery after church on Sunday, executed commissions for him in\r\nLondon, and sent him game: and Sydney was under obligations to him for\r\nmany a morning of sport, and many a service such as gentlemen who are\r\nnot above five-and-twenty and its freaks can render to boys entering\r\ntheir teens.  Whatever might be his opinion of women generally, from the\r\nparticular specimens which had come in his way, he had too much sense\r\nand gentlemanly feeling to include Mrs Grey\'s guests in the dislike he\r\nfelt towards herself, or to suppose that they must necessarily share her\r\ndisposition towards his relations.  Perhaps he felt, unknown to himself\r\nsome inclination to prepossess them in favour of his connections; to\r\nstretch his complaisance a little, as a precaution against the\r\nprejudices with which he knew Mrs Grey would attempt to occupy their\r\nminds.  However this might be, he was as amicable with Margaret as his\r\nmother was with her sister.\r\n\r\nHe soon found out that the strangers were more interested about the\r\nnatural features of Deerbrook than about its gossip.  He was amused at\r\nthe earnestness of Margaret\'s inquiries about the scenery of the\r\nneighbourhood, and he laughingly promised that she should see every nook\r\nwithin twenty miles.\r\n\r\n"People always care least about what they have just at hand," said he.\r\n"I dare say, if I were to ask you, you have never seen a glass-bottle\r\nblown, or a tea-tray painted?"\r\n\r\n"If I have," said Margaret, "I know many ladies in Birmingham who have\r\nnot."\r\n\r\n"You will not be surprised, then, if you find some ladies in Deerbrook\r\nwho do not ride, and who can tell you no more of the pretty places near\r\nthan if they had been brought up in Whitechapel.  They keep their best\r\nsights for strangers, and not for common use.  I am, in reality, only a\r\nvisitor at Deerbrook.  I do not live here, and never did; yet I am\r\nbetter able to be your guide than almost any resident.  The ladies,\r\nespecially, are extremely domestic: they are far too busy to have ever\r\nlooked about them.  But I will speak to Mr Grey, and--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, pray, do not trouble Mr Grey!  He has too much business on his\r\nhands already; and he is so kind, he will be putting himself out of his\r\nway for us; and all we want is to be in the open air in the fields."\r\n\r\n"`All you want!\' very like starlings in a cage;" and he looked as if he\r\nwas smiling at the well-known speech of the starling; but he did not\r\nquote it.  "My mother is now saying that Mr Hope finds time for\r\neverything: and she is right.  He will help us.  You must see Hope, and\r\nyou must like him.  He is the great boast of the place, next to the new\r\nsign."\r\n\r\n"Is the sign remarkable, or only new?"\r\n\r\n"Very remarkable for ingenuity, if not for beauty.  It is `The Bonnet so\r\nBlue:\'--a lady\'s bonnet of blue satin, with brown bows, or whatever you\r\nmay call the trimming when you see it; and we are favoured besides with\r\na portrait of the milliner, holding the bonnet so blue.  We talk nearly\r\nas much of this sign as of Mr Hope; but you must see them both, and\r\ntell us which you like best."\r\n\r\n"We have seen Mr Hope.  He was here yesterday evening."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, you must see him again; and you must not think the worse of\r\nhim for his being praised by everybody you meet.  It is no ordinary case\r\nof a village apothecary."\r\n\r\nMargaret laughed; so little did Mr Hope look like the village\r\napothecary of her imagination.\r\n\r\n"Ah, I see you know something of the predilection of villagers for their\r\napothecary,--how the young people wonder that he always cures everybody;\r\nand how the old people could not live without him; and how the poor\r\nfolks take him for a sort of magician; and how he obtains more knowledge\r\nof human affairs than any other kind of man.  But Hope is, though a very\r\nhappy man, not this sort of privileged person.  His friends are so\r\nattached to him that they confide to him all their own affairs; but they\r\nrespect him too much to gossip at large to him of other people\'s.  I see\r\nyou do not know how to credit this; but I assure you, though the\r\ninhabitants of Deerbrook are as accomplished in the arts of gossip as\r\nany villagers in England, Hope knows little more than you do at this\r\nmoment about who are upon terms and who are not."\r\n\r\n"My sister and I must learn his art of ignorance," said Margaret.  "If\r\nit be really true that the place is full of quarrels, we shall be afraid\r\nto stay, unless we can contrive to know nothing about them."\r\n\r\n"Oh, do not suppose we are worse than others who live in villages.\r\nSince our present rector came, we have risen somewhat above the rural\r\naverage of peace and quiet."\r\n\r\n"And the country has always been identical with the idea of peace and\r\nquiet to us town-bred people!" said Margaret.\r\n\r\n"And very properly, in one sense.  But if you leave behind the din of\r\nstreets for the sake of stepping forth from your work-table upon a soft\r\nlawn, or of looking out upon the old church steeple among the trees,\r\nwhile you hear nothing but bleating and chirping, you must expect some\r\nset-off against such advantages: and that set-off is the being among a\r\nsmall number of people, who are always busy looking into one another\'s\r\nsmall concerns."\r\n\r\n"But this is not a necessary evil," said Margaret.  "From what you were\r\nsaying just now, it appears that it may be avoided."\r\n\r\n"From what I was saying about Hope.  Yes; such an one as Hope may get\r\nall the good out of every situation, without its evils; but--"\r\n\r\n"But nobody else," said Margaret, smiling.  "Well, Hester and I must try\r\nwhether we cannot have to do with lawns and sheep for a few months,\r\nwithout quarrelling or having to do with quarrels."\r\n\r\n"And what if you are made the subject of quarrels?" asked Mr Enderby.\r\n"How are you to help yourselves, in that case?"\r\n\r\n"How does Mr Hope help himself in that case?"\r\n\r\n"It remains to be seen.  As far as I know, the whole place is agreed\r\nabout him at present.  Every one will tell you that never was society so\r\nblessed in a medical man before;--from the rector and my mother, who\r\nnever quarrel with anybody, down to the village scold.  I am not going\r\nto prepossess you against even our village scold, by telling her name.\r\nYou will know it in time, though your first acquaintance will probably\r\nbe with her voice."\r\n\r\n"So we are to hear something besides bleating and chirping?"\r\n\r\nA tremendous knock at the door occurred, as if in answer to this.  All\r\nthe conversation in the room suddenly stopped, and Mr and Mrs Rowland\r\nwalked in.\r\n\r\n"This is my sister, Mrs Rowland," observed Mr Enderby to Margaret.\r\n\r\n"This is my daughter Priscilla, Mrs Rowland," said Mrs Enderby to\r\nHester.\r\n\r\nBoth sisters were annoyed at feeling timid and nervous on being\r\nintroduced to the lady.  There is something imposing in hearing a mere\r\nname very often, in the proof that the person it belongs to fills a\r\nlarge space in people\'s minds: and when the person is thus frequently\r\nnamed with fear and dislike, an idea is originated of a command over\r\npowers of evil which makes the actual presence absolutely awful.  This\r\nseemed now to be felt by all.  Sophia had nothing to say: Mrs Grey\'s\r\nhead twitched nervously, while she turned from one to another with\r\nslight remarks: Mrs Enderby ran on about their having all happened to\r\ncall at once, and its being quite a family party in Mrs Grey\'s parlour;\r\nand Mr Philip\'s flow of conversation had stopped.  Margaret thought he\r\nwas trying to help laughing.\r\n\r\nThe call could not be an agreeable one.  The partners\' ladies quoted\r\ntheir own children\'s sayings about school and Miss Young, and Miss\r\nYoung\'s praise of the children; and each vied with the other in eulogium\r\non Miss Young, evidently on the ground of her hopes of Fanny and Mary on\r\nthe one hand, and of Matilda, George, and Anna, on the other.  Mrs\r\nEnderby interposed praises of all the children, while Mr Rowland\r\nengaged Hester\'s attention, calling off her observation and his own from\r\nthe sparring of the rival mothers.  Philip informed Margaret at length,\r\nthat George was a fine little fellow, who would make a good sportsman.\r\nThere was some pleasure in taking such a boy out fishing.  But Mr\r\nPhilip had lighted on a dangerous topic, as he soon found.  His sister\r\nheard what he was saying, and began an earnest protest against little\r\nboys fishing, on account of the danger, and against any idea that she\r\nwould allow her George to run any such risks.  Of course, this made Mrs\r\nGrey fire up, as at an imputation upon her care of her son Sydney; and\r\nbefore the rest of the company could talk down the dispute, it bore too\r\nmuch of the appearance of a recrimination about the discharge of\r\nmaternal duties.  Margaret thought that, but for the relationship, Mrs\r\nRowland might fairly be concluded to be the village scold alluded to by\r\nMr Enderby.  It was impossible that he could have been speaking of his\r\nsister; but Deerbrook was an unfortunate place if it contained a more\r\nunamiable person than she appeared at this moment.  The faces of the two\r\nladies were still flushed with excitement when Mr Hope came in.  The\r\nsisters thought he appeared like a good genius, so amiable did the party\r\ngrow on his entrance.  It seemed as if he was as great a favourite with\r\nthe Rowlands as with the other family; so friendly was the gentleman,\r\nand so gracious the lady; while Mr Hope was, to all appearance,\r\nunconscious of the existence of any unpleasant feelings among his\r\nneighbours.  The talk flowed on about the concerns of personages of the\r\nvillage, about the aspect of public affairs, about the poets of the age,\r\nand what kind of poetry was most read in Deerbrook, and how the Book\r\nSociety went on, till all had grown cordial, and some began to propose\r\nto be hospitable.  Mrs Rowland hoped for the honour of seeing the Miss\r\nIbbotsons one day the next week, when Mr Rowland should have returned\r\nfrom a little excursion of business.  Mrs Enderby wondered whether she\r\ncould prevail on all her young friends to spend an evening with her\r\nbefore her son left Deerbrook; and Mrs Grey gave notice that she should\r\nshortly issue her invitations to those with whom she wished her young\r\ncousins to become better acquainted.\r\n\r\nAll went right for the rest of the morning.  When the Enderbys and\r\nRowlands went away, the Levitts came.  When Dr Levitt inquired about\r\nthe schools of Birmingham, it could not but come out that Hester and\r\nMargaret were dissenters.  Yet, as they were desired to observe, he did\r\nnot seem in the least shocked, and his manner was just as kind to them\r\nafter this disclosure as before.  He was pronounced a very liberal man.\r\nMr Hope was asked to stay to dinner, and Mrs Grey complacently related\r\nthe events of the morning to her husband as he took his place at table.\r\nDeerbrook had done its duty to Hester and Margaret pretty well for the\r\nfirst day.  Everybody of consequence had called but the Andersons, and\r\nthey would no doubt come on Sunday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIVE.\r\n\r\nTHE MEADOWS.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon was the time when Miss Young\'s pupils practised the\r\nmysteries of the needle.  Little girls are not usually fond of sewing.\r\nTill they become clever enough to have devices of their own, to cut out\r\na doll\'s petticoat, or contrive a pin-cushion to surprise mamma, sewing\r\nis a mere galling of the fingers and strain upon the patience.  Every\r\nwry stitch shows, and is pretty sure to be remarked upon: the seam or\r\nhem seems longer the oftener it is measured, till the little work-woman\r\nbecomes capable of the enterprise of despatching a whole one at a\r\nsitting; after which the glory is found to ameliorate the toil, and\r\nthere is a chance that the girl may become fond of sewing.\r\n\r\nMiss Young\'s pupils had not arrived at this stage.  It was a mystery to\r\nthem that Miss Young could sit sewing, as fast as her needle could fly,\r\nfor the whole afternoon, and during the intervals of their lessons in\r\nthe morning.  It was in vain that she told them that some of her\r\npleasantest hours were those which she passed in this employment: and\r\nthat she thought they would perhaps grow as fond of work as their sister\r\nSophia before they were as old as she.  With languid steps did the twins\r\nreturn to the house this afternoon for another pair of shirt-sleeves,\r\nand to show mamma the work they had finished.  Hand in hand, as usual,\r\nand carrying up for judgment their last performance, they entered the\r\nhouse.  In a very different mood did they return.  Running, skipping,\r\nand jumping, they burst again into the summer-house.\r\n\r\n"Miss Young, oh, Miss Young, we are to have a holiday!"\r\n\r\n"Mamma sends her compliments to you, Miss Young, and she hopes you will\r\ngive us a holiday.  It is a fine afternoon, she thinks, and my cousins\r\nhave never gathered cowslips; and we are all going into the meadow for a\r\ncowslip-gathering; and Mr Hope will come to us there.  He has to go\r\nsomewhere now, but he will come to us before we have half done."\r\n\r\nMatilda Rowland looked fall of dismay till she was told that Mrs Grey\r\nhoped she would be of the party, and begged that she would, go directly\r\nand ask her mamma\'s leave.\r\n\r\n"What a quantity of cowslips we shall get!" observed Mary, as she took\r\ndown Fanny\'s basket from the nail on which it hung, and then her own.\r\n"We are each to have a basket, mamma says, that we may not quarrel.\r\nWhat shall we do with such a quantity of cowslips?"\r\n\r\n"Make tea of them, to be sure," replied Fanny.  "We may dry them in this\r\nwindow, may not we, Miss Young?  And we will give you some of our\r\ncowslip-tea."\r\n\r\nMiss Young smiled and thanked them.  She did not promise to drink any of\r\nthe promised tea.  She had a vivid remembrance of the cowslip-drying of\r\nher young days, when the picked flowers lay in a window till they were\r\nlaced all over with cobwebs; and when they were at length popped into\r\nthe teapot with all speed, to hide the fact that they were mouldy.  She\r\nremembered the good-natured attempts of her father and mother to swallow\r\na doll\'s cupful of her cowslip-tea, rather than discourage the spirit of\r\nenterprise which, now that she had lost those whom she loved, was all\r\nthat she had to trust to.\r\n\r\n"Fanny," said Mary, with eyes wide open, "cannot we have a feast here\r\nfor my cousins, when we make our cowslip-tea?"\r\n\r\n"A feast!  Oh, that would be grand!" replied Fanny.  "I have a shilling,\r\nand so have you; and we could buy a good many nice things for that: and\r\nMatilda Rowland will lend us her doll\'s dishes to put with ours.  Miss\r\nYoung, will you let us have our feast here, one afternoon?  We will ask\r\nmy cousins, without telling them anything; and they will be so\r\nsurprised!"\r\n\r\nMiss Young promised everything, engaged not to tell, smoothed their\r\nhair, tied their bonnets, and sent them away quite happy with their\r\nsecret.\r\n\r\nSuch a holiday as this was one of Miss Young\'s few pleasures.  There\r\nwere several occasions in the year when she could make sure beforehand\r\nof some hours to herself.  Her Sundays were much occupied with the\r\nSunday-school, and with intercourse with poor neighbours whom she could\r\nnot meet on any other day: but Christmas-day, the day of the annual fair\r\nof Deerbrook, and two or three more, were her own.  These were, however,\r\nso appropriated, long before, to some object, that they lost much of\r\ntheir character of holidays.  Her true holidays were such as the\r\nafternoon of this day,--hours suddenly set free, little gifts of leisure\r\nto be spent according to the fancy of the moment.  Let none pretend to\r\nunderstand the value of such whose lives are all leisure; who take up a\r\nbook to pass the time; who saunter in gardens because there are no\r\nmorning visits to make; who exaggerate the writing of a family letter\r\ninto important business.  Such have their own enjoyments: but they know\r\nnothing of the paroxysm of pleasure of a really hardworking person on\r\nhearing the door shut which excludes the business of life, and leaves\r\nthe delight of free thoughts and hands.  The worst part of it is the\r\nhaving to decide how to make the most of liberty.  Miss Young was not\r\nlong in settling this point.  She just glanced up at her shelf of books,\r\nand down upon her drawing-board, and abroad through the south window,\r\nand made up her mind.  The acacia with its fresh bunches of blossoms was\r\nwaving above the window, casting in flickering shadows upon the floor:\r\nthe evergreens of the shrubbery twinkled in the sun, as the light breeze\r\nswept over them: the birds were chirruping all about, and a yellow\r\nbutterfly alighted and trembled on the window-sill at the moment.  It\r\nwas one of the softest and gayest days of spring; and the best thing was\r\nto do nothing but enjoy it.  She moved to the south window with her\r\nwork, and sewed or let the wind blow upon her face as she looked out.\r\n\r\nThe landscape was a wide one.  Far beyond, and somewhat below the garden\r\nand shrubberies in which the summerhouse stood, flat meadows stretched\r\nto the brink of the river, on the other side of which were the park\r\nwoods.  All was bathed in the afternoon sunshine, except where a tree\r\nhere and there cast a flake of shadow upon the grass of the meadows.\r\n\r\n"It is a luxury," thought the gazer, "for one who cannot move about to\r\nsit here and look abroad.  I wonder whether I should have been with the\r\nparty if I had not been lame.  I dare say something would have taken off\r\nfrom the pleasure if I had.  But how well I can remember what the\r\npleasure is! the jumping stiles--the feel of the turf underfoot,--the\r\nrunning after every flower,--the going wherever one has a fancy to go,--\r\nhow well I remember it all!  And yet it gives me a sort of surprise to\r\nsee the activity of these children, and how little they are aware of\r\nwhat their privilege is.  I fancy, however, the pleasure is more in the\r\nrecollection of all such natural enjoyments than at the moment.  It is\r\nso with me, and I believe with everybody.  This very landscape is more\r\nbeautiful to me in the dark night when I cannot sleep, than at this very\r\nmoment, when it looks its best and brightest: and surely this is the\r\ngreat difference between that sort of pleasures and those which come\r\naltogether from within.  The delight of a happy mood of mind is beyond\r\neverything at the time; it sets one above all that can happen; it steeps\r\none in heaven itself; but one cannot recall it: one can only remember\r\nthat it was so.  The delight of being in such a place as those woods is\r\ngenerally more or less spoiled at the time by trifles which are\r\nforgotten afterwards;--one is hungry, or tired, or a little vexed with\r\nsomebody, or doubtful whether somebody else is not vexed; but then the\r\nremembrance is purely delicious,--brighter in sunshine, softer in\r\nshade,--wholly tempered to what is genial.  The imagination is a better\r\nmedium than the eye.  This is surely the reason why Byron could not\r\nwrite poetry on Lake Leman, but found he must wait till he got within\r\nfour walls.  This is the reason why we are all more moved by the\r\nslightest glimpses of good descriptions in books than by the amplitude\r\nof the same objects before our eyes.  I used to wonder how that was,\r\nwhen, as a child, I read the openings of scenes and books in `Paradise\r\nLost.\'  I saw plenty of summer sunrises; but none of them gave me a\r\nfeeling like the two lines:--\r\n\r\n  "`Now morn, her rosy steps in the eastern clime\r\n  Advancing, sowed the earth with orient pearl.\'\r\n\r\n"If all this be so, our lot is more equalised than is commonly thought.\r\nOnce having received pictures into our minds, and possessing a clear eye\r\nin the mind to see them with, the going about to obtain more is not of\r\nvery great consequence.  This comforts one for prisoners suffering\r\n_carcere duro_, and for townspeople who cannot often get out of the\r\nstreets; and for lame people like me, who see others tripping over\r\ncommons and through fields where we cannot go.  I wish there was as much\r\ncomfort the other way,--about such as suffer from unhappy moods of mind,\r\nand know little of the joy of the highest.  It would be a small gain to\r\nthem to fly like birds,--to see like the eagle itself.--Oh, there are\r\nthe children!  So that is their cowslip meadow!  How like children they\r\nall look together, down on the grass!--gathering cowslips, I suppose.\r\nThe two in black are more eager about it than Sophia.  She sits on the\r\nstile while they are busy.  The children are holding forth to their\r\ncousins,--teaching them something, evidently.  How I love to overlook\r\npeople,--to watch them acting unconsciously, and speculate for them!  It\r\nis the most tempting thing in the world to contrast the little affairs\r\none sees them busy about, with the very serious ones which await them,--\r\nwhich await every one.  There are those two strangers busy gathering\r\ncowslips, and perhaps thinking of nothing beyond the fresh pleasure of\r\nthe air and the grass, and the scent of their flowers,--their minds\r\nquite filled with the spirit of the spring, when who knows what may be\r\nawaiting them!  Love may be just at hand.  The tempest of passion may be\r\nbrewing under this soft sunshine.  They think themselves now as full of\r\nhappiness as possible; and a little while hence, upon a few words\r\nspoken, a glance exchanged, they may be in such a heaven of bliss that\r\nthey will smile at their own ignorance in being so well pleased to-day.\r\nOr--but I pray they may escape the other chance.  Neither of them knows\r\nanything of that misery yet, I am confident.  They both look too young,\r\ntoo open, too free to have really suffered.--I wonder whether it is\r\nfoolish to fancy already that one of them may be settled here.  It can\r\nhardly be foolish, when the thought occurs so naturally: and these great\r\naffairs of life lie distinctly under the eye of such as are themselves\r\ncut off from them.  I am out of the game, and why should not I look upon\r\nits chances?  I am quite alone; and why should I not watch for others?\r\nEvery situation has its privileges and its obligations.--What is it to\r\nbe alone, and to be let alone, as I am?  It is to be put into a post of\r\nobservation on others: but the knowledge so gained is anything but a\r\ngood if it stops at mere knowledge,--if it does not make me feel and\r\nact.  Women who have what I am not to have, a home, an intimate, a\r\nperpetual call out of themselves, may go on more safely, perhaps,\r\nwithout any thought for themselves, than I with all my best\r\nconsideration: but I, with the blessing of a peremptory vocation, which\r\nis to stand me instead of sympathy, ties and spontaneous action,--I may\r\nfind out that it is my proper business to keep an intent eye upon the\r\npossible events of other people\'s lives, that I may use slight occasions\r\nof action which might otherwise pass me by.  If one were thoroughly wise\r\nand good, this would be a sort of divine lot.  Without being at all\r\nwiser or better than others,--being even as weak in judgment and in\r\nfaith as I am,--something may be made of it.  Without daring to meddle,\r\none may stand clear-sighted, ready to help.--How the children are flying\r\nover the meadow towards that gentleman who is fastening his horse to the\r\ngate!  Mr Hope, no doubt.  He is the oldest cowslip gatherer of them\r\nall, I fancy.  If one could overhear the talk in every house along the\r\nvillage, I dare say some of it is about Mr Hope winning one of these\r\nyoung ladies.  If so, it is only what I am thinking about myself.  Every\r\none wishes to see Mr Hope married,--every one, even to the servants\r\nhere, who are always disputing whether he will not have Miss Sophia, or\r\nwhether Miss Sophia is not to make a grander match.  Sophia will not do\r\nfor him; but it is very possible that one of these girls may.  And the\r\nother--but I will not think about that to-day.--How yellow the glow is\r\nupon those woods!  What heavenly hues hang about the world we live in!\r\nbut how strange is the lot of some in it!  One would wonder why, when\r\nall are so plainly made to feel and act together, there should be any\r\none completely solitary.  There must be a reason: I would fain know it;\r\nbut I can wait till we may know all."\r\n\r\nSuch were some of Maria Young\'s natural and unchecked thoughts.  There\r\nwas not much of common holiday spirit in them: but to Maria, liberty and\r\npeace were holiday, and her mind was not otherwise than peaceful.  She\r\nwas serious, but not sad.  Any one who could at the moment have seen her\r\nface, would have pronounced her cheerful at heart; and so she was.  She\r\nhad been so long and so far banished from ordinary happiness, that her\r\nown quiet speculations were material enough for cheerfulness.  The\r\nsubject on which she would not think to-day, was the possibility of one\r\nof the sisters attaching Mr Enderby.  Maria Young had not always been\r\nsolitary, and lame, and poor.  Her father had not been very long dead;\r\nand while he lived, no one supposed that his only child would be poor.\r\nHer youth passed gaily, and her adversity came suddenly.  Her father was\r\nwont to drive her out in his gig, almost every summer day.  One evening,\r\nthe horse took fright, and upset the gig on a heap of stones by the\r\nroad-side.  Mr Young was taken up dead, and Maria was lamed for life.\r\nShe had always known the Enderbys very well; and there had been some\r\ngossip among their mutual acquaintance, about the probability that\r\nPhilip would prove to be Maria\'s lover, when he should be old enough to\r\nthink of marrying.  It never went further than this,--except in Maria\'s\r\nown heart.  She had, indeed, hoped--even supposed--that in Philip\'s mind\r\nthe affair had at least been entertained thus far.  She could never\r\nsettle to her own satisfaction whether she had been weak and mistaken,\r\nor whether she had really been in any degree wronged.  There had been\r\nwords, there had been looks,--but words and looks are so easily\r\nmisinterpreted!  The probability was that she had no one to blame but\r\nherself--if fault there was.  Perhaps there was no fault anywhere: but\r\nthere was misery, intense and long.  During her illness, no tidings came\r\nof Philip.  He was in another part of the country when the accident\r\nhappened; and it was not till long after it had been made known that Mr\r\nYoung had died insolvent,--not till after Maria had recovered, as far as\r\nrecovery was possible,--not till she had fallen into the habit of\r\nearning her bread, that Philip reappeared, and shook hands with her, and\r\ntold her with how much concern he had heard of her sufferings.  This\r\ninterview gave her entire possession of herself:--so she believed.  She\r\ngot through it calmly, and it left her with one subject at least of\r\nintense thankfulness,--that her mind was known only to herself.\r\nWhatever might be her solitary struggles, she might look without shame\r\ninto the face of every human being.  She could bear being pitied for her\r\npoverty, for her lameness, for her change of prospects, when the\r\nrecollection of this came across any of her acquaintance.  If it had\r\nbeen necessary, she could probably have borne to be pitied for having\r\nloved without return; but she could not be too thankful that it was not\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nMaria was right in her supposition that the village was speculating upon\r\nthe newly-arrived young ladies.  The parish clerk had for some years,\r\nindeed ever since the death of the late stationer and dispenser of\r\nletters, carried on a flirtation with the widow, notwithstanding the\r\nrumours which were current, as to the cause to which her late husband\r\nowed his death.  It was believed that poor Harry Plumstead died of\r\nexhaustion from his wife\'s voice; for she was no other than the village\r\nscold, of whose existence Margaret had been warned by Mr Enderby.  Some\r\nthought that Owen was acting a politic part in protracting this\r\nflirtation,--keeping her temper in check by his hold upon her\r\nexpectations; and such had little doubt that the affair would linger on\r\nto the end, without any other result than Owen\'s exemption meanwhile\r\nfrom the inflictions of her tongue, to which, in the discharge of his\r\noffice, he might otherwise become frequently liable.  Others wished to\r\nsee them married, believing that in Owen, a Welshman sufficiently\r\nirascible, Mrs Plumstead would at last meet her match.  This afternoon,\r\nan observer would have thought the affair was proceeding to this point.\r\nMrs Plumstead, looking particularly comely and gracious, was putting up\r\nan unclaimed letter at the window for display, when Owen stopped to ask\r\nif she had seen the pretty young ladies who had come to Deerbrook.  He\r\nremarked that, to be sure, they might have gone to some place where they\r\nwere more wanted, for Deerbrook was not without pretty faces of its own\r\nbefore: and, as he said so, he smiled hard in the widow\'s face.  He\r\nshould not wonder if some work for the rector should rise up before\r\nlong, for, where there were pretty faces, weddings might be looked for.\r\nHe even asked Mrs Plumstead if she did not think so: and added\r\nsomething so ambiguous about his own share in the work for the rector\r\nwhich was to arise, that the widow could not make out whether he spoke\r\nas her admirer or as parish clerk.  In the milliner\'s workroom there was\r\na spirited conversation between Miss Nares and her assistant, on the\r\npast wedding dresses of Deerbrook, arising out of the topic of the\r\nday,--the Miss Ibbotsons.  Mrs Howell, who, with her shopwoman, Miss\r\nMiskin, dispensed the haberdashery of the place, smiled winningly at\r\nevery customer who entered her shop, and talked of delightful\r\nacquisitions, and what must be felt about Mr Hope, in the midst of such\r\ncharming society, and what it must be hoped would be felt; and how gay\r\nthe place was likely to be with riding parties, and boating parties, and\r\nsome said, dances on the green at Mrs Enderby\'s; and how partners in a\r\ndance have been known to become partners for life, as she had been\r\njocosely told when her poor dear Howell prevailed on her to stand up\r\nwith him,--the first time for twenty years,--at his niece\'s wedding.\r\nHester\'s beauty, and what Mrs Grey had said about it to her maid, were\r\ndiscussed, just at the moment when Hester, passing the shop, was\r\nentreated by Sophia to look at a new pattern of embroidery which had\r\nlately arrived from London, and was suspended at the window.  Mrs\r\nHowell and her gossips caught a glimpse of the face of the young lady,\r\nthrough the drapery of prints and muslins, and the festoons of ribbons;\r\nand when the party proceeded down the street, there was a rush to the\r\ndoor, in order to obtain a view of her figure.  She was pronounced\r\nbeautiful; and it was hoped that some gentleman in the village would\r\nfind her irresistible.  It was only rather strange that no gentleman was\r\nin attendance on her now.\r\n\r\nIf the gossips could have followed the party with their eyes into the\r\nmeadow, they would soon have been satisfied; for it was not long before\r\nMr Hope joined them there.  On leaving Mr Grey\'s table, he was as\r\nlittle disposed to go and visit his patient, as medical men are when\r\nthey are called away from the merriest company, or at the most\r\ninteresting moment of a conversation.  The liability to this kind of\r\ninterruption is one of the great drawbacks of the profession, to which\r\nMr Hope belonged; another is, the impossibility of travelling,--the\r\nbeing fixed to one place for life, without any but the shortest\r\nintervals of journeying.  Mr Hope had been settled for five years at\r\nDeerbrook; and, during that time, he had scarcely been out of sight of\r\nits steeple.  His own active and gladsome mind had kept him happy among\r\nhis occupations.  There was no one in the place with whom he could hold\r\nequal converse; but, while he had it not, he did not feel the pressing\r\nwant of it.  He loved his profession, and it kept him busy.  His kind\r\nheart was ever full of interest for his poorer patients.  Seeing the\r\nbest side of everybody, he could be entertained, though sometimes vexed,\r\nby his intercourse with the Greys and Rowlands.  Then there was the\r\nkindly-tempered and gentlemanly rector; and Philip Enderby often came\r\ndown for a few weeks; and Mr Hope had the chief management of the Book\r\nSociety, and could thus see the best new books; and his professional\r\nrides lay through a remarkably pretty country.\r\n\r\nHe kept up a punctual and copious correspondence with the members of his\r\nown family,--with his married sisters, and with his only brother, now\r\nwith his regiment in India,--relating to them every important\r\ncircumstance of his lot, and almost every interesting feeling of his\r\nheart.  With this variety of resources, life had passed away cheerily,\r\non the whole, with Mr Hope, for the five years of his residence at\r\nDeerbrook; though there were times when he wondered whether it was to be\r\nalways thus,--whether he was to pass to his grave without any higher or\r\ndeeper human intercourses than he had here.  If it had been possible, he\r\nmight, like other men as wise as himself, have invested some one of the\r\nyoung ladies of Deerbrook with imaginary attributes, and have fallen in\r\nlove with a creature of his own fancy.  But it really was not possible.\r\nThere was no one of the young ladies of Deerbrook who was not so far\r\ninferior to the women of Hope\'s own family,--to the mother he had lost,\r\nand the sisters who were settled far away,--as to render this commonest\r\nof all delusions impossible to him.\r\n\r\nTo such a man, so circumstanced, it may be imagined how great an event\r\nwas the meeting with Hester and Margaret.  He could not be in their\r\npresence ten minutes without becoming aware of their superiority to\r\nevery woman he had seen for five years past.  The beauty of the one, the\r\nsincerity and unconsciousness of the other, and the general elevation of\r\nboth, struck him forcibly the first evening.  His earliest thought the\r\nnext morning was of some great event having taken place; and when he\r\nleft Mr Grey\'s door after dinner, it was with an unwillingness which\r\nmade him spur himself and his horse on to their business, that he might\r\nthe sooner return to his new-found pleasure.  His thoughts already\r\ndarted forward to the time when the Miss Ibbotsons would be leaving\r\nDeerbrook.  It was already a heavy thought how dull Deerbrook would be\r\nwithout them.  He was already unconsciously looking at every object in\r\nand around the familiar place with the eyes of the strangers,\r\nspeculating on how the whole would appear to them.  In short, his mind\r\nwas full of them.  There are, perhaps, none who do not know what this\r\nkind of impression is.  All have felt it, at some time or other,--many\r\nhave felt it often,--about strangers whom they have been predisposed to\r\nlike, or with whom they have been struck at meeting.  Nine times out of\r\nten, perhaps, the impression is fleeting; and when it is gone, there is\r\nan unwillingness to return to it, from a sense of absurdity in having\r\nbeen so much interested about one who so soon became indifferent: but\r\nthe fact is not the less real and general for this.  When it happens\r\nbetween two young people who are previously fancy-free, and\r\ncircumstances favour the impression till it sinks deeper than the fancy,\r\nit takes the name of love at first sight.  Otherwise it passes away\r\nwithout a name, without a record:--for the hour it is a secret: in an\r\nafter time it is forgotten.\r\n\r\nPossessed unconsciously with this secret, Hope threw himself from his\r\nhorse at the entrance of the meadow where the cowslip-gatherers were\r\nbusy, fastened his steed to the gate, and joined the party.  The\r\nchildren ran to him with the gleanings of intelligence which they had\r\nacquired since he saw them last, half an hour before:--that it was well\r\nthey did not put off their gathering any longer, for some of the flowers\r\nwere beginning to dry up already: that cousins had never tasted\r\ncowslip-tea;--(was not this _very_ odd?)--that cousin Hester would not\r\nhelp to pick the flowers for drying,--she thought it such a pity to pull\r\nthe blossom out of the calyx: that Sophia would not help either, because\r\nit was warm: that cousin Margaret had gathered a great many, but she had\r\nbeen ever so long watching a spider\'s nest,--a nasty large spider\'s nest\r\nthat Matilda was just going to break into, when cousin Margaret asked\r\nher not to spoil it?\r\n\r\nMargaret was indeed on her knees, prying into the spider\'s nest.  When\r\nduly laughed at, she owned to having seen cobwebs before, but maintained\r\nthat cobwebs in a closet were a very different affair from a spider\'s\r\nnest in a field.\r\n\r\n"I rather think, however," said she, "the word `nest\' itself has\r\nsomething to do with my liking, for what I have been looking at.  Some\r\nof your commonest country words have a charm to the ear and imagination\r\nof townspeople that you could not understand."\r\n\r\n"But," said Mr Hope, "I thought nests were very common in Birmingham.\r\nHave you not nests of boxes, and nests of work-tables?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, and so we have stacks of chimneys; but yet we do not think of\r\nhay-making when we see the smoke of the town.--I rather think country\r\nwords are only captivating as relating to the country; but then you\r\ncannot think how bewitching they are to people who live in streets."\r\n\r\n"The children might have found you a prettier sort of nest to indulge\r\nyour fancy with, I should think.  There must be plenty of creatures\r\nbesides spiders in this wide meadow."\r\n\r\nMr Hope called out to the little girls, that whoever should find any\r\nsort of a nest in the meadow, for Miss Margaret Ibbotson, should have a\r\nride on his horse.  Away flew the children; and Hester and Sophia came\r\nfrom the water-side to know what all the bustle was about.  Fanny\r\nreturned to inquire whether the nests must be _in_ the meadow; whether\r\njust outside would not do.  She knew there was an ants\' nest in the\r\nbank, just on the other side of the hedge.  The decision was that the\r\nants\' nest would do only in case of her not being able to find any other\r\nwithin bounds.  Sophia looked on languidly, probably thinking all this\r\nvery silly.  It put her in mind of an old schoolfellow of hers who had\r\nbeen called very clever before she came to school at nine years old.\r\nTill she saw her, Sophia had believed that town children were always\r\nclever: but no later than the very first day, this little girl had got\r\ninto disgrace with the governess.  Her task was to learn by heart\r\nGoldsmith\'s Country Clergyman, in the `Deserted Village.\'  She said it\r\nquite perfectly, but, when questioned about the meaning, stopped short\r\nat the first line,--"Near yonder copse where once a garden smiled."  She\r\npersisted that she did not know what a copse was: the governess said she\r\nwas obstinate, and shut her up in the play hours between morning and\r\nafternoon school.  Sophia never could make out whether the girl was\r\nfoolish or obstinate in persisting that she did not know what a copse\r\nwas: but her cousin Margaret now put her in mind of this girl, with all\r\nher town feelings, and her fuss about spiders\' nests.\r\n\r\n"How is old Mr Smithson to-day?"  Sophia inquired of Mr Hope, by way\r\nof introducing something more rational.\r\n\r\n"Not better: it is scarcely possible that he should be," was the reply.\r\n\r\n"Papa thought last night he must be dying."\r\n\r\n"He is dying."\r\n\r\n"Have you just come from a patient who is dying?" asked Hester, with a\r\nlook of anxiety, with which was mixed some surprise.\r\n\r\n"Yes: from one who cannot live many days."\r\n\r\nSophia observed that Mr James had been sent for early this morning--no\r\ndoubt to put the finish to the will: but nobody seemed to know whether\r\nthe old gentleman would leave his money to his nephew or his step-son,\r\nor whether he would divide it between them.  Hester and Margaret showed\r\nno anxiety on this point, but seemed so ready to be interested about\r\nsome others as to make Mr Hope think that they were only restrained by\r\ndelicacy from asking all that he could tell about his patient\'s state.\r\nThey knew enough of the profession, however, to be aware that this kind\r\nof inquiry is the last which should be addressed to a medical man.\r\n\r\n"You are surprised," said he, "that I am come from a dying patient to\r\nplay with the children in the fields.  Come, acknowledge that this is in\r\nyour minds."\r\n\r\n"If it is, it is an unreasonable thought," said Margaret.  "You must see\r\nso many dying people, it would be hard that in every case you should be\r\nput out of the reach of pleasure."\r\n\r\n"Never mind the hardship, if it be fitting," said Hope.  "Hard or not\r\nhard, is it natural,--is it possible?"\r\n\r\n"I suppose witnessing death so often does lessen the feelings about it,"\r\nobserved Hester.  "Yet I cannot fancy that one\'s mind could be at\r\nliberty for small concerns immediately after leaving a house full of\r\nmourners, and the sight of one in pain.  There must be something\r\ndistasteful in everything that meets one\'s eyes,--in the sunshine\r\nitself."\r\n\r\n"True.  That is the feeling in such cases: but such cases seldom occur.\r\nYes: I mean what I say.  Such cases are very rare.  The dying person is\r\ncommonly old, or so worn out by illness as to make death at last no\r\nevil.  When the illness is shorter, it is usually found that a few hours\r\nin the sick room do the work of months of common life, in reconciling\r\nthe minds of survivors."\r\n\r\n"I am sure that is true," observed Margaret.\r\n\r\n"It is so generally the case that I know no set of circumstances in\r\nwhich I should more confidently reckon on the calmness, forethought, and\r\ncomposure of the persons I have to deal with than in the family of a\r\ndying person.  The news comes suddenly to the neighbours: all the\r\ncircumstances rush at once into their imaginations: all their\r\nrecollections and feelings about the sufferer agitate them in quick\r\nsuccession; and they naturally suppose the near friends must be more\r\nagitated, in proportion to their nearness."\r\n\r\n"The watchers, meanwhile," said Hester, "have had time in the long night\r\nto go over the past and the future, again and again; and by morning all\r\nseems so familiar, that they think they can never be surprised into\r\ngrief again."\r\n\r\n"So familiar," said Mr Hope, "that their minds are at liberty for the\r\nsmallest particulars of their duty.  I usually find them ready for the\r\nminutest directions I may have to give."\r\n\r\n"Yes: the time for surprise,--for consternation,--is long afterwards,"\r\nsaid Hester, with some emotion.  "When the whole has become settled and\r\nfinished in other minds, the nearest mourners begin to wake up to their\r\nmourning."\r\n\r\n"And thus," said Margaret, "the strongest agitation is happily not\r\nwitnessed."\r\n\r\n"Happily not," said Mr Hope.  "I doubt whether anybody\'s strongest\r\nagitations ever are witnessed.  I doubt whether the sufferer himself is\r\noften aware of what are really his greatest sufferings; and he is so\r\nashamed of them that he hides them from himself when it is possible.  I\r\ncannot but think that any grief which reveals itself is very endurable."\r\n\r\n"Is not that rather hard?" asked Margaret.\r\n\r\n"How does it seem to you hard?  Is it not merciful that we can keep our\r\nworst sorrows,--that we are disposed, as it were forced, to keep them\r\nfrom afflicting our friends?"\r\n\r\n"But is it not saying that bereavement of friends is not the greatest of\r\nsorrows, while all seem to agree that it is?"\r\n\r\n"Is it, generally speaking, the greatest of sorrows?  I think not, for\r\nmy own part.  There are cases in which the loss is too heavy to bear\r\nbeing the subject of any speculation, almost of observation; for\r\ninstance, when the happiest married people are separated, or when a\r\nfirst or only child dies: but I think there are many sorrows greater\r\nthan a separation by death of those who have faith enough to live\r\nindependently of each other, and mutual love enough to deserve, as they\r\nhope, to meet again hereafter.  I assure you I have sometimes come away\r\nfrom houses unvisited, and unlikely to be visited by death, with a heart\r\nso heavy as I have rarely or never brought from a deathbed."\r\n\r\n"I should have thought that would be left for the rector to say,"\r\nobserved Hester.  "I should have supposed you meant cases of guilt or\r\nremorse."\r\n\r\n"Cases of guilt or remorse," continued Mr Hope, "and also of infirmity.\r\nPeople may say what they will, but I am persuaded that there is\r\nimmeasurably more suffering endured, both in paroxysms and for a\r\ncontinuance, from infirmity, tendency to a particular fault, or the\r\nprivation of a sense, than from the loss of any friend upon earth,\r\nexcept the very nearest and dearest; and even that case is no exception,\r\nwhen there is the faith of meeting again, which almost every mourner\r\nhas, so natural and welcome as it is."\r\n\r\n"Do you tell your infirm friends the high opinion you have of their\r\nsufferings?" asked Margaret.\r\n\r\n"Why, not exactly; that would not be the kindest thing to do, would it?\r\nWhat they want is, to have their trouble lightened to them, not made the\r\nworst of;--lightened, not by using any deceit, of course, but by simply\r\ntreating their case as a matter of fact."\r\n\r\n"Then surely you should make light of the case of the dying too: make\r\nlight of it even to the survivors.  Do you do this?"\r\n\r\n"In one sense I do; in another sense no one can do it.  Not regarding\r\ndeath as a misfortune, I cannot affect to consider it so.  Regarding the\r\nchange of existence as a very serious one, I cannot, of course, make\r\nlight of it."\r\n\r\n"That way of looking at it regards only the dying person; you have not\r\nsaid how you speak of it to survivors."\r\n\r\n"As I speak of it to you now, or to myself when I see any one die; with\r\nthe added consideration of what the survivors are about to lose.  That\r\nis a large consideration certainly; but should not one give them credit\r\nfor viewing death as it is, and for being willing to bear their own loss\r\ncheerfully, as they would desire to bear any other kind of loss?\r\nespecially if, as they say, they believe it to be only for a time."\r\n\r\n"This as looking on the bright side," observed Hester, in a low voice;\r\nbut she was overheard by Mr Hope.\r\n\r\n"I trust you do not object to the bright side of things," said he,\r\nsmiling, "as long as there is so much about us that is really very\r\ndark?"\r\n\r\n"What can religion be for," said Margaret, "or reason, or philosophy,\r\nwhichever name you may call your faith by, but to show us the bright\r\nside of everything--of death among the rest?  I have often wondered why\r\nwe seem to try to make the most of that evil (if evil it be), while we\r\nthink it a duty to make the least of every other.  I had some such\r\nfeeling, I suppose, when I was surprised to hear that you had come\r\nhither straight from a deathbed: I do not wonder at all now."\r\n\r\n"Mr Smithson will not be much missed," observed Sophia, who felt\r\nherself relieved from the solemnity of the occasion, by what had passed,\r\nand at liberty to speak of him as freely as if he was no nearer death\r\nthan ever.  "He has never been a sociable neighbour.  I always thought\r\nhim an odd old man, from the earliest time I can remember."\r\n\r\n"Some few will miss him," said Mr Hope.  "He is a simple-hearted, shy\r\nman, who never did himself justice, except with two or three who saw\r\nmost of him.  Their affection has been enough for him--enough to make\r\nhim think now that his life has been a very happy one.  There!" cried\r\nHope, as a lark sprang up almost from under the feet of the\r\nparty--"There is another member of Deerbrook society, ladies, who is\r\nanxious to make your acquaintance."  There were two or three larks\r\nhovering above the meadow at this moment, and others were soaring\r\nfurther off.  The air was full of lark music.  The party stood still and\r\nlistened.  Looking up into the sunny sky, they watched one little\r\nwarbler, wheeling round, falling, rising again, still warbling, till it\r\nseemed as if it could never be exhausted.  Sophia said it made her head\r\nache to look up so long; and she seemed impatient for the bird to have\r\ndone.  It then struck her that she also might find a nest, like her\r\nsisters; and she examined the place whence the lark had sprung.  Under a\r\nthick tuft of grass, in a little hollow, she found a family of infant\r\nlarks huddled together, and pointed them out to her cousins.\r\n\r\nThe children came upon being called.  They were damped in spirits.  They\r\ndid not see how they were to find any nests, if the ants\' nest would not\r\ndo; unless, indeed, Mr Hope would hold them up into the trees or hedges\r\nto look; but they could not climb trees, Mr Hope knew.  They were\r\nsomewhat further mortified by perceiving that they might have found a\r\nnest by examining the ground, if they had happened to think of it.\r\nMargaret begged they would not be distressed at not finding nests for\r\nher; and Mr Hope proposed to try his luck, saying, that if he\r\nsucceeded, every one who wished should have a ride on his horse.\r\n\r\nTo the surprise of the children, he turned towards the water, and walked\r\nalong the bank.  The brimming river was smooth as glass; and where it\r\nstood in among the rushes, and in every tiny inlet, it was as clear as\r\nthe air, and alive with small fish, which darted at the flies that\r\ndimpled the surface.  A swan, which had been quietly sailing in the\r\nmiddle of the stream, changed its deportment as the party proceeded\r\nalong the bank.  It ruffled its breast feathers, arched back its neck\r\ntill the head rested between the erect wings, and drove through the\r\nwater with a speed which shivered the pictures in it as a sweeping gale\r\nwould have done.\r\n\r\n"What is the matter with the creature?" asked Margaret; "I never saw a\r\nswan behave so."\r\n\r\nThe children seemed rather afraid that the bird would come on shore and\r\nattack them.  Mr Hope took the opportunity of its being at some little\r\ndistance, to open the rushes, and show where a fine milk-white egg lay\r\nin a large round nest.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr Hope, you knew!" cried the children, "you knew there was a\r\nswan\'s nest near."\r\n\r\n"Yes; and did not you, when you saw how the swan behaved?  But I was\r\naware of this nest before.  Tom Creach has the care of the park swans;\r\nhe made this nest, and he told me where it was.  Let your cousins have a\r\npeep; and then we will go, before the poor swan grows too much\r\nfrightened.  And now, who will have a ride on my horse?"\r\n\r\nAll the children chose to ride; and, while Mr Hope was coursing with\r\nthem in turn, round and round the meadow, the young ladies proceeded\r\nalong the bank.  A quarter of a mile further on, they fell in with\r\nSydney Grey and his friend Mr Philip.  They had been successful in\r\ntheir sport.  Mr Enderby had had enough of it, and was stretched on the\r\ngrass reading, while Sydney stood on the roots of an old oak, casting\r\nhis line into the pool beneath its shadow.\r\n\r\n"So, here you are, quite safe!" said Sophia; "George Rowland might have\r\ncome after all.  Poor boy!  I am glad he is not with us, he would be so\r\nmortified to see all the fish you have caught without him!"\r\n\r\n"How many times have we been in the river, Sydney?  Can you remember?"\r\nasked Mr Enderby.\r\n\r\n"I have seen no fish big enough to pull us in," said Sydney; "and I do\r\nnot know any other way of getting a wetting at this sport.  Mrs Rowland\r\nshould have seen George and me climbing the old oak at the two-mile\r\nturning.  I dared George to it, and there he hung over the water, at the\r\nend of the branch, riding up and down like a see-saw.  She would think\r\nnothing of letting him go fishing after that."\r\n\r\n"If the branch had broken," said Mr Enderby, "what would you have done\r\nthen?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, it is not often that a branch breaks."\r\n\r\n"Old oaks are apt to break, sooner or later; and, the next time you dare\r\nGeorge to see-saw over the river, I would advise you to consider\r\nbeforehand how you would get him out, in case of his dropping in."\r\n\r\n"Oh, he is not afraid.  One day lately, when the water was low, he\r\noffered to cross the weir at Dingleford.  I did not persuade him to\r\nthat; but he pulled off his shoes and stockings, and got over and back,\r\nsafe enough."\r\n\r\n"Indeed! and you tried it too, I suppose?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; it would be a shame if I could not do what George can.  It was\r\nalmost as easy as walking along this bank."\r\n\r\n"I shall talk to Master George, however, before he goes to Dingleford\r\nagain, or he may chance to find it easier some day to miss his footing\r\nthan to hold it."\r\n\r\n"I wonder Mrs Rowland is afraid to let George go out with you," said\r\nSophia, "considering what things he does when you are not with him."\r\n\r\n"She does not know of these pranks, or she would feel as you do; and I\r\nhope every one here will be kind enough not to tell her.  It would only\r\nbe making her anxious to no purpose, whenever the boy is out of her\r\nsight.  It would be a pity to make a coward of him; and I think I can\r\nteach him what is mischief, and what is not, without disturbing her.\r\nCome, ladies, suppose you rest yourselves here; you will find a pleasant\r\nseat on this bank: at least, I fell asleep on it just now, as if I had\r\nbeen on a sofa."\r\n\r\n"I wish you would all go to sleep, or else walk off," said Sydney.  "You\r\nmake so much noise I shall never catch any fish."\r\n\r\n"Suppose you were to go somewhere else," said Mr Enderby. "Would not\r\nthat be rather more civil than sending us all away?"\r\n\r\nSydney thought he would find another place: there were plenty along the\r\nbank.  He gathered up bait and basket, and trudged off.  There was an\r\namusement, however, which he liked better even than fishing; and for\r\nwhich he now surrendered it.  He was presently seen cantering round the\r\nmeadow on Mr Hope\'s horse.\r\n\r\nMr Enderby hoped the Miss Ibbotsons were able to say "No" with\r\ndecision.  If not, he did not envy them their supper this evening; for\r\nSydney would certainly ask them to eat all the fish he had caught--bream\r\nand dace and all.  The first pleasure of young anglers is to catch these\r\nsmall fry; and the next is, to make their sisters and cousins eat them.\r\nSophia solemnly assured her cousins that mamma never allowed Sydney\'s\r\nfish to come to table, at least in the house.  If the children liked to\r\nget the cook to boil them for their dolls\' feasts in the schoolroom,\r\nthey might.\r\n\r\n"And then Miss Young is favoured with a share, I suppose?" said\r\nMargaret.\r\n\r\n"Have you made acquaintance with Miss Young yet?" inquired Mr Enderby.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes!  I had the pleasure of knowing Miss Young long before I knew\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Long! how long?  I was not aware that you had ever met.  Where did you\r\nmeet?"\r\n\r\n"In the schoolroom, before breakfast,--full four hours before you called\r\nthis morning."\r\n\r\n"Oh, that is all you mean!  I wondered how you should know her."\r\n\r\nSophia asked whether Margaret and Miss Young were not going to study\r\ntogether: Margaret assented.  Miss Young was kind enough to promise to\r\nhelp her to read German.\r\n\r\n"And you?" said Mr Enderby to Hester.\r\n\r\n"Why, no; I am rather afraid of the undertaking."\r\n\r\n"And you, Miss Grey?"\r\n\r\n"No.  Mamma says, I have enough to do with my history and my music;\r\nespecially while my cousins are here.  I began German once, but mamma\r\nthought I was growing awry, and so I left it off.  I find Mrs Rowland\r\nmeans Matilda to learn German."\r\n\r\n"We are all disposed to have my little nieces learn whatever Miss Young\r\nwill be kind enough to teach them; they will gain nothing but good from\r\nher."\r\n\r\n"She is very learned, to be sure," observed Sophia.\r\n\r\n"And something more than learned, I should think," said Hester; "I fancy\r\nshe is wise."\r\n\r\n"How can you have discovered that already?" asked Mr Enderby, whose\r\nfingers were busy dissecting a stalk of flowering grass.\r\n\r\n"I hardly know; I have nothing to quote for my opinion.  Her\r\nconversation leaves a general impression of her being very sensible."\r\n\r\n"Sensible, as she is a woman," observed Margaret; "if she were a man,\r\nshe would be called philosophical."\r\n\r\n"She _is_ very superior," observed Sophia.  "It was mamma\'s doing that\r\nshe is the children\'s governess."\r\n\r\n"Philosophical!" repeated Mr Enderby.  "It is a happy thing that she is\r\nphilosophical in her circumstances, poor thing!"\r\n\r\n"As she happens to be unprosperous," said Margaret, smiling.  "If she\r\nwere rich, and strong, and admired, her philosophy would be laughed at;\r\nit would only be in the way."\r\n\r\nMr Enderby sighed, and made no answer.  Before any one spoke again, Mr\r\nHope and his little companions came up.\r\n\r\n"How quiet you all are!" exclaimed Sydney.  "I\'ve a good mind to come\r\nand fish here again, if you will only go on to be so drowsy."\r\n\r\nSophia declared that they had been talking, up to the last minute, about\r\nMiss Young, and learning German, and being philosophical.\r\n\r\n"And which of the party have you made out to be the most philosophical?"\r\ninquired Mr Hope.\r\n\r\n"We have not so much as made out what philosophy is for," said Hester;\r\n"can you tell us?"\r\n\r\nAs she looked up at Mr Hope, who was standing behind her, Sydney\r\nthought her question was addressed to him.  Swinging his fishing-rod\r\nround, he replied doubtfully that he thought philosophy was good to know\r\nhow to do things.  What sort of things?  Why, to make phosphorus lights,\r\nand electrify people, as Dr Levitt did, when he made Sophia jump off\r\nthe stool with glass legs.  Sophia was sure that any one else would have\r\njumped off the stool as she did.  She should take good care never to\r\njump on it again.  But she wondered Sydney did not know any better than\r\nthat what philosophy was for.  Her cousins said Miss Young was\r\nphilosophical, and she had nothing to do with phosphorus or electrical\r\nmachines.\r\n\r\nMr Enderby explained to Mr Hope that he had said what he was ready to\r\nmaintain; that it was a happy thing for any one who, like Miss Young,\r\nwas not so prosperous as she had been, to be supported by philosophy.\r\n\r\n"And, granting this," said Margaret, "it was next inquired whether this\r\nsame philosophy would have been considered equally admirable, equally a\r\nmatter of congratulation, if Miss Young had not wanted it for solace."\r\n\r\n"A question as old as the brigg at Stirling," replied Mr Hope; "older,\r\nolder than any bridges of man\'s making."\r\n\r\n"Why Stirling brigg?  What do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"I mean--do not you know the story?--that an old woman wanted to cross\r\nthe Forth, and some ferrymen would have persuaded her to go in their\r\nboat when she was confident that a tempest was coming on, which would\r\nhave made the ferry unsafe.  They told her at last that she must trust\r\nto Providence.  `Na, na,\' said she, `I will ne\'er trust to Providence\r\nwhile there is a brigg at Stirling.\'  The common practice is, you know,\r\nwith the old woman.--We will not trust to the highest support we profess\r\nto have, till nothing else is left us.  We worship philosophy, but never\r\nthink of making use of it while we have prosperity as well."\r\n\r\n"The question is whether such practice is wise," said Margaret: "we all\r\nknow it is common."\r\n\r\n"For my part," said Mr Enderby, "I think the old Scotchwoman was right;\r\nProvidence helps those that help themselves, and takes care of those who\r\ntake care of themselves."\r\n\r\n"Just so," said Hope.  "Her error was in supposing that the one course\r\nwas an alternative from the other,--that she would not be trusting in\r\nProvidence as much in going by the bridge as in braving the tempest.  I\r\nthink we are in the same error when we set up philosophy and prosperity\r\nin opposition to each other, taking up with the one when we cannot get\r\nthe other, as if philosophy were not over all, compassing our life as\r\nthe blue sky overarches the earth, brightening, vivifying, harmonising\r\nall, whether we look up to see whence the light comes or not."\r\n\r\n"You think it a mistake, then," said Margaret, "not to look up to it\r\ntill all is night below, and there is no light to be seen but by gazing\r\noverhead?"\r\n\r\n"I do not see why we should miss seeing the white clouds and blue depths\r\nat noon because we may reckon upon moon and stars at midnight.  Then\r\nagain, what is life at its best without philosophy?"\r\n\r\n"I can tell you, as well as anybody," said Mr Enderby, "for I never had\r\nany philosophy,--no, neither wisdom, nor the love of wisdom, nor\r\npatience, nor any of the things that philosophy is understood to mean."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr Enderby!" cried Sydney, "what pains you took to teach me to\r\nfish, and to make me wait patiently for a bite!  _You_ say you are not\r\npatient!"\r\n\r\n"My account of life without philosophy," said Mr Enderby, proceeding as\r\nif he did not hear the children testifying to his patience with\r\nthem,--"my account of life without philosophy is, that it slips away\r\nmighty easily, till it is gone, you scarcely know where or how."\r\n\r\n"And when you call upon philosophy at last to give an account of it,\r\nwhat does she say?" asked Margaret.\r\n\r\n"I do not understand how life can slip away so," said Hester.  "Is there\r\never a day without its sting?--without doubt of somebody, disappointment\r\nin oneself or another, dread of some evil, or weariness of spirit?\r\nProsperity is no more of a cure for these than for sickness and death.\r\nIf philosophy is--"\r\n\r\n"Well!" exclaimed Mr Hope, with strong interest, "if philosophy is--"\r\n\r\n"Happy they that have her, for all need her."\r\n\r\n"Hear a testimony at least as candid as your own, Enderby.  If you\r\nreally find life steal away as easily as you now fancy, depend upon it\r\nyou are more of a philosopher than you are aware of."\r\n\r\n"What is philosophy?" asked Matilda of Sydney in a loud whisper, which\r\nthe boy was not in any hurry to take notice of, so little was there in\r\nthe conversation which seemed to bear upon phosphorus and electricity.\r\n\r\n"A good question," observed Mr Enderby.  "Hope, will you tell us\r\nchildren what we are talking about,--what philosophy is all this while?"\r\n\r\n"You gave us a few meanings just now, which I should put into one.  Call\r\nit enlargement of views, and you have wisdom, and the love of wisdom,\r\nand patience, all at once: ay, Sydney, and your kind of philosophy\r\ntoo:--It was by looking far and deep into nature that men found\r\nelectricity."\r\n\r\n"Did Dr Levitt find it out?" asked Matilda: "he is so very\r\nshort-sighted!  I don\'t believe he would see those fish snapping up the\r\nflies, if he sat where I do.  What was that that fell on my bonnet?  Is\r\nit raining?"\r\n\r\nSydney, tired of fishing, had climbed into the oak, and was sending down\r\ntwigs and leaves upon the heads of the party.  Sophia desired him to\r\ncome down, and even assured him that if he did not, she should be angry.\r\nHe replied, that he would only stay to see whether she would be angry\r\nor not.  The experiment was cut short by the whole party rising, and\r\nmoving homewards.  The sun was setting, and the picked cowslips must not\r\nhave any dew upon them.\r\n\r\nAs the group passed up the street, Sydney in advance, with his rod and\r\nbasket, on Mr Hope\'s horse, Mr Hope himself following with Hester, and\r\nthe tall Mr Enderby, with Sophia and Margaret on either arm, all, like\r\nthe little girls, laden with cowslips, the gossips of Deerbrook were\r\nsatisfied that the stranger ladies must have enjoyed their walk in the\r\nmeadows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIX.\r\n\r\nTHE SCHOOL-ROOM.\r\n\r\nMrs Rowland was mortified that the Greys had been beforehand with her\r\nin the idea of a cowslip-gathering.  From the moment of Matilda\'s asking\r\nleave to accompany them, she resolved to have such an expedition from\r\nher house as her neighbours should not be able to eclipse.  Like Lear,\r\nshe did not yet know what her deed was to be; but it should be the\r\nwonder and terror of the place: she would do such things as should\r\nstrike the strangers with admiration.  When she heard an account of it\r\nfrom her little daughter, she found this had been a very poor\r\nbeginning,--a mere walk in the meadows, and home again to tea;--no\r\nboiling the kettle in the woods,--not even a surprise of early\r\nstrawberries.  She could not call this being forestalled; it could not\r\ngive the young ladies any idea of a proper country excursion, with four\r\nor five carriages, or a boat with an awning.  As soon as Mr Rowland\r\ncame home in the evening, she consulted him about the day, the place,\r\nthe mode, and the numbers to be invited.  Mr Rowland was so well\r\npleased to find his lady in the mood to be civil to her neighbours, that\r\nhe started no difficulties, and exerted himself to overcome such as\r\ncould not be overlooked.  All the planning prospered so well, that notes\r\nto the Grey family and to the Miss Ibbotsons lay on Mr Grey\'s\r\nbreakfast-table the next morning, inviting the whole party to dine with\r\nMrs Rowland in Dingleford woods, that day week--the carriages to be at\r\nthe door at ten o\'clock.\r\n\r\nThe whole village rang with the preparations for this excursion; and the\r\nvillage was destined to ring with other tidings before it took place.\r\nMrs Rowland often said that she had the worst luck in the world; and it\r\nseemed as if all small events fell out so as to plague her.  She had an\r\nunusual fertility in such sensible suppositions and reasonable\r\ncomplaints; and her whole diversity of expressions of this kind was\r\ncalled into play about this expedition to Dingleford woods.  The hams\r\nwere actually boiled, and the chicken-pies baked, when clouds began to\r\ngather in the sky; and on the appointed morning, pattens clinked in the\r\nvillage street, Miss Young\'s umbrella was wet through in the mere\r\ntransit from the farrier\'s gate to the schoolroom; the gravel-walk\r\nbefore Mr Grey\'s house was full of yellow pools, and the gurgling of\r\nspouts or drips from the trees was heard on every side.  The worst of it\r\nwas, this rain came after a drought of many weeks, which had perilled\r\nthe young crops, and almost destroyed the hopes of hay; the ladies and\r\nchildren had been far from sufficiently sorry to hear that some of the\r\npoorer wheat lands in the county had been ploughed up, and that there\r\nwas no calculating what hay would be a ton the next winter.  They were\r\nnow to receive the retribution of their indifference; rain had set in,\r\nand the farmers hoped that it might continue for a month.  It would not\r\nbe wise to fix any country excursion for a few weeks to come.  Let the\r\nyoung people enjoy any fine afternoon that they might be able to turn to\r\nthe account of a walk, or a drive, or a sail on the river; but picnic\r\nparties must be deferred till settled weather came.  There was every\r\nhope that the middle of the summer would be fine and seasonable, if the\r\nrains came down freely now.\r\n\r\nThis course of meteorological events involved two great vexations to\r\nMrs Rowland.  One was, that the neighbours, who could pretend to\r\nentertain the strangers only in a quiet way at home, took the\r\nopportunity of the rainy weather to do so, hoping, as they said, not to\r\ninterfere with any more agreeable engagements.  Mrs Rowland really\r\nnever saw anything so dissipated as the Greys; they were out almost\r\nevery evening when they had not company at home.  It was impossible that\r\nSophia\'s studies could go on as they ought to do.  What with taking a\r\nquiet cup of tea with one acquaintance, and being at a merry reading\r\nparty at another\'s, and Mrs Enderby\'s little dance, and dinner at the\r\nLevitts\', there were few evenings left; and on those few evenings they\r\nwere never content to be alone.  They were always giving the young men\r\nencouragement to go in.  Mr Hope made quite a home house of Mr Grey\'s;\r\nand as for Philip, he seemed now to be more at Mr Grey\'s than even at\r\nhis own mother\'s or sister\'s.  Mrs Grey ought to remember how bad all\r\nthis was for a girl of Sophia\'s age.  It would completely spoil the\r\nexcursion to Dingleford woods.  The young people knew one another so\r\nwell by this time, that the novelty was all worn off, and they would\r\nhave nothing left to say to each other.  It was provoking that Mr\r\nRowland had promised that the excursion should take place whenever the\r\nweather should be settled enough.  It might so fairly have been given\r\nup! and now it must be gone on with, when every one was tired of the\r\nidea, and the young people must almost be weary of one another, from\r\nbeing always together!\r\n\r\nThe other vexation was, that there were frequent short intervals of fine\r\nweather, which were immediately taken advantage of for a drive, or a\r\nwalk, or a sail; and it came out one day from the children, who had\r\nlearned it in the schoolroom, that the Miss Ibbotsons had been in\r\nDingleford woods.  There had been no such intention when the party set\r\nout; they had not designed to go nearly so far; but they had been\r\ntempted on by the beauty of the evening and of the scenery, till they\r\nhad found it the shortest way to come home through the Dingleford woods.\r\nMrs Rowland pronounced this abominable; and she was not appeased by\r\nhearing that her brother had been the proposer of this mode of return,\r\nand the guide of the party.  Philip forgot everything, she declared, in\r\nhis fancy for these girls; it was always his fault that he was carried\r\naway by the people he was with: he had got the name of a flirt by it,\r\nand a flirt he was; but she had never known him so possessed as he\r\nseemed to be by these strangers.  She must speak to Mr Rowland about\r\nit; the matter might really become serious; and if he should ever be\r\nentrapped into marrying into the Grey connections, among people so\r\ndecidedly objectionable, it would be a terrible self-reproach to her as\r\nlong as she lived, that she had not interfered in time.  She should\r\nspeak to Mr Rowland.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile she kept a watchful eye on her brother\'s proceedings.  She\r\nfound from the children that their Uncle Philip had fulfilled his\r\npromise of going to see the schoolroom, and had been so much better than\r\nhis word, that he had been there very often.  When he went, it was\r\nalways when the Miss Ibbotsons were there, learning German, or drawing,\r\nor talking with Miss Young.  It was impossible to pick a quarrel with\r\nMiss Young about this; for she always sent her visitors away the moment\r\nthe clock struck the school hour.  The summer-house was Mr Grey\'s\r\nproperty, too; so that Mrs Rowland could only be angry at the studies\r\nwhich went on in it, and had no power to close the doors against any of\r\nthe parties.\r\n\r\nThe rainy weather had indeed been very propitious to the study of\r\nGerman.  For a fortnight Margaret had spent some hours of each day with\r\nMiss Young; and over their books they had learned so much of one\r\nanother\'s heart and mind, that a strong regard had sprung up between\r\nthem.  This new friendship was a great event to Miss Young;--how great,\r\nshe herself could scarcely have believed beforehand.  Her pupils found\r\nthat Miss Young was now very merry sometimes.  Mr Grey observed to his\r\nwife that the warmer weather seemed to agree with the poor young woman,\r\nas she had some little colour in her cheeks at last; and Margaret\r\nherself observed a change in the tone of the philosophy she had admired\r\nfrom the beginning.  There was somewhat less of reasoning in it, and\r\nmore of impulse; it was as sound as ever, but more genial.  While never\r\nforgetting the constancy of change in human affairs, she was heartily\r\nwilling to enjoy the good that befell her, while it lasted.  It was well\r\nthat she could do so; for the good of this new friendship was presently\r\nalloyed.\r\n\r\nShe was not aware, and it was well that she was not, that Hester was\r\njealous of her, almost from the hour of Margaret\'s learning what a vast\r\nnumber of irregular verbs there is in the German.  Each sister\r\nremembered the conversation by the open window, on the night of their\r\narrival at Deerbrook.  Remembering it, Margaret made Hester a partaker\r\nin all her feelings about Maria Young; her admiration, her pity, her\r\nesteem.  Reserving to herself any confidence which Maria placed in her\r\n(in which, however, no mention of Mr Enderby ever occurred), she kept\r\nnot a thought or feeling of her own from her sister.  The consequence\r\nwas, that Hester found that Maria filled a large space in Margaret\'s\r\nmind, and that a new interest had risen up in which she had little\r\nshare.  She, too, remembered the conversation, but had not strength to\r\nact up to the spirit of it.  She had then owned her weakness, and called\r\nit wickedness, and fancied that she could never mistrust her sister\r\nagain.  She was now so ashamed of her own consciousness of being once\r\nmore jealous, that she strove to hide the fact from herself; and was not\r\ntherefore likely to tell it to Margaret.  She struggled hourly with\r\nherself, rebuking her own temper, and making appeals to her own\r\ngenerosity.  She sat drawing in the little blue parlour, morning after\r\nmorning, during Sophia\'s reading or practising, telling herself that\r\nMargaret and Miss Young had no secrets, no desire to be always\r\n_tete-a-tete_; that they had properly invited her to learn German; and\r\nthat she had only to go at any moment, and offer to join them, to be\r\njoyfully received.  She argued with herself,--how mean it would be to do\r\nso; to agree to study at last, in order to be a sort of spy upon them,\r\nto watch over her own interests; as if Margaret--the most sincere and\r\nfaithful of living beings--were not to be trusted with them.  She had\r\noften vowed that she would cure the jealousy of her temper; now was the\r\noccasion, and she would meet it; she would steadily sit beside Sophia or\r\nMrs Grey every morning, when Margaret was not with her, and never let\r\nher sister know how selfish she could be.\r\n\r\nThis was all very well; but it could not make Margaret suppose her\r\nsister happy when she was not.  She could not be certain what was the\r\nmatter, but she saw that something was wrong.  At times, Hester\'s manner\r\nwas so unboundedly affectionate, that it was impossible to suppose that\r\nunkind feelings existed towards herself; though a few pettish words were\r\nat other times let drop.  Hester\'s moods of magnanimity and jealousy\r\nwere accounted for in other ways by her sister.  Margaret believed,\r\nafter a course of very close observation, that she had discovered, in\r\ninvestigating the cause of Hester\'s discomposure, a secret which was\r\nunknown to her sister herself.  Margaret was not experienced in love,\r\nnor in watching the signs of it; but here was the mind she understood\r\nbest, discomposed without apparent cause--more fond, more generous to\r\nherself than ever, yet not reposing its usual confidence in her--and\r\nsubject to those starts of delight and disappointment which she had\r\nheard and could understand to be the moods of love.  She was confirmed\r\nin her suspicion by observing that the merits of Mr Hope were becoming\r\ndaily a less common subject of conversation between them, while it was\r\ncertain that he had in no degree lost favour with either.  They had been\r\ncharmed with him from the beginning, and had expressed to each other the\r\nfreest admiration of his truth, his gaiety, his accomplishments, and\r\ngreat superiority to the people amidst whom he lived.  He was now spoken\r\nof less every day, while his visits grew more frequent, longer, and,\r\nMargaret could not but think, more welcome to her sister.  The hours\r\nwhen he was sure not to come happened to be those which she spent with\r\nMiss Young--the hours in which gentlemen are devoted to their business.\r\nMargaret thus witnessed all that passed; and if her conjecture about\r\nHester was right, she could have wished to see Mr Hope\'s manner rather\r\ndifferent from what it was.  He was evidently strongly attracted to the\r\nhouse; and there was some reason to think that Mrs Grey believed that\r\nHester was the attraction.  But Margaret had no such impression.  She\r\nsaw that Mr Hope admired her sister\'s beauty, listened to her\r\nconversation with interest, and was moved at times by the generosity of\r\nher tone of moral feeling; but this, though much, was not enough for the\r\nanxious sister\'s full satisfaction; and the one thing besides which she\r\nwould fain have discerned she could not perceive.  These were early days\r\nyet, however; so early that, in the case of any one whom she knew,\r\nexcept her sister, she should have supposed her own conjectures wild and\r\nalmost improper; but Hester\'s was one of those natures to which time and\r\ncircumstance minister more speedily and more abundantly than to the\r\ngenerality.  By the strength of her feelings, and the activity of her\r\naffections, time was made more comprehensive, and circumstance more\r\nweighty than to others.  A day would produce changes in her which the\r\nimpressions of a week would not effect in less passionate natures; and\r\nwhat were trifling incidents to the minds about her, were great events\r\nto her.\r\n\r\nMargaret began to consider what was to be done.  The more she thought,\r\nthe more plainly she perceived that there was nothing to be done but to\r\noccupy Hester, simply and naturally, with as many interests as possible.\r\nThis was safe practice, be the cause of her occasional discomposure\r\nwhat it might.  It was particularly desirable that she should not\r\ncontinue the habit of sitting in silence for a considerable part of\r\nevery morning.\r\n\r\nOne day, just after the voices of the children had been heard in the\r\nhall, giving token that school was over, Hester, sitting in the little\r\nblue parlour alone, with her head on her hand, was apparently\r\ncontemplating the drawing on her board, but really considering that\r\nMargaret was now beginning to be happy with her friend, and asking why\r\nMargaret should not be happy with her friend, when Margaret herself\r\nentered.\r\n\r\n"Do you want Sophia?" said Hester.  "She is up-stairs."\r\n\r\n"No; I want you."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!"\r\n\r\nThere was an ironical tone of surprise in the one word she spoke, which\r\nlet fall a weight upon Margaret\'s heart;--an old feeling, but one to\r\nwhich she had made no progress towards being reconciled.\r\n\r\n"I cannot help you with your German, you know.  How can you pretend to\r\nwant me?"\r\n\r\n"It is not about the German at all that I want you.  Maria has found a\r\nSpenser at last, and I am going to read her the `Hymn of Heavenly\r\nBeauty,\' I know you never can hear that often enough; so come!"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps Miss Young had rather not.  I should be sorry to intrude myself\r\nupon her.  But, however," continued she, observing Margaret\'s look of\r\nsurprise, "I will come.  Do not wait for me, dear.  I will come the\r\nmoment I have put up my drawing."\r\n\r\nMargaret did wait, running over the keys of the open piano meanwhile.\r\n\r\n"Shall I call Sophia too?" asked Hester, as she took up her work-bag.\r\n"I dare say she never read any of Spenser."\r\n\r\n"I dare say not," replied Margaret; "and she would not care about it\r\nnow.  If you think we ought, we will call her.  If not--"\r\n\r\nHester smiled, nodded, and led the way to the schoolroom without calling\r\nSophia.  She had not been two minutes in the cordial presence of her\r\nsister and Maria, before she felt the full absurdity of the feelings\r\nwhich had occupied her so lately, and was angry with herself to her own\r\nsatisfaction.  Her companions looked at each other with a smile as they\r\nobserved at the same moment the downcast attitude of her moistened eyes,\r\nthe beautiful blush on her cheek, and the expression of meek emotion on\r\nher lips.  They thought that it was the image of heavenly beauty which\r\nmoved her thus.\r\n\r\nBefore they had quite finished the Hymn, the door was burst open, and\r\nthe children entered, dragging in Mr Enderby.  Mr Enderby rebuked\r\nthem, good-naturedly, for introducing him with so little ceremony, and\r\ndeclared to the ladies that Matilda had promised to knock before she\r\nopened the door.  Hester advised Mary and Fanny to be more quiet in\r\ntheir mode of entrance, observing that they had made Miss Young start\r\nwith their hurry.\r\n\r\nMatilda was glad her uncle remembered to come sometimes.  He had\r\npromised it several weeks before he came at all; even when he said he\r\nwas going away in a fortnight.\r\n\r\n"And if I had gone away in a fortnight," said he, "I should not have\r\nseen your schoolroom.  But this is not the first time I have seen it, as\r\nyou remember very well.  I have been here often lately."\r\n\r\n"But you never attend to me here, uncle!  And I want so to show you my\r\ndesk, where I keep my copy-book, and the work-box you gave me on my\r\nbirthday."\r\n\r\n"Well, you can show me now, cannot you?  So, this is your desk!  It\r\nseems convenient enough, whatever we may think of its beauty.  I suppose\r\nit will hold all the knowledge you will want to have put into your head\r\nfor some time to come.  Now show me which is George\'s desk, and which\r\nFanny\'s; and now Mary\'s,--a nice row of desks!  Now," whispering to her,\r\n"can you show me which is Miss Margaret\'s desk?"\r\n\r\nThe little girl giggled as she answered, that Miss Margaret was too old\r\nto be a school-girl.\r\n\r\n"So she is: but she learns of Miss Young, and I know she keeps some of\r\nher books here.  Can you show me where?"\r\n\r\nThere was a desk rather larger than the rest, the lid of which now\r\nhappened to be standing open.  Matilda slyly pointed to it.  While the\r\nladies were engaged with the other children, Mr Enderby cast a glance\r\ninto this desk, saw a book which he knew to be Margaret\'s, laid\r\nsomething upon it from his pocket, and softly closed the lid; the whole\r\npassing, if it was observed at all, as a survey of the children\'s desks.\r\nHe then pretended to look round for the rod.\r\n\r\n"No rod!" said he to the laughing children.  "Oh, I should like to learn\r\nhere very much, if there is no rod.  Miss Margaret, do you not find it\r\nvery pleasant learning here?"\r\n\r\nThe children were shouting, "Miss Young, Miss Young, do let uncle Philip\r\ncome and learn with us.  He says he will be a very good boy,--won\'t you,\r\nuncle Philip?  Miss Young, when may uncle Philip come and learn his\r\nlessons?"\r\n\r\nMargaret saw that there was constraint in the smile with which Maria\r\nanswered the children.  Little as she knew, it struck her that in his\r\nfun with the children, Mr Enderby was relying quite sufficiently on the\r\nphilosophy he had professed to admire in Miss Young.  Mr Enderby drew a\r\nchair to the window round which the ladies were sitting, and took up the\r\nvolume Margaret had just laid down.\r\n\r\n"Go, go, children!" said he; "run away to your gardens!  I cannot spare\r\nyou any more play to-day."\r\n\r\n"Oh, but uncle, we want to ask you a question."\r\n\r\n"Well, ask it."\r\n\r\n"But it is a secret.  You must come into the corner with Fanny, and\r\nMary, and me."\r\n\r\nFor peace and quiet he went into the corner with them, and they\r\nwhispered into each ear a question, how many burnt almonds and\r\ngingerbread-buttons, and how much barley-sugar, two shillings and\r\nthreepence halfpenny would buy?  The cowslips were now ready to make tea\r\nof, and the feast on the dolls\' dishes might be served any day.  Mr\r\nEnderby promised to inquire at the confectioner\'s, and not to tell\r\nanybody else; and at last the children were got rid of.\r\n\r\n"Now that we have done with mysteries," said he, as he resumed his seat\r\nby the window, "that is, with children\'s mysteries that we can see to\r\nthe bottom of, let us look a little into the poet\'s mysteries.  What\r\nwere you reading?  Show me, and I will be your reader.  Who or what is\r\nthis Heavenly Beauty?  We have not done with mysteries yet, I see."\r\n\r\n"I was wondering," said Margaret smiling, "whether you take up Spenser\r\nbecause you are tired of mysteries.  In such a case, some other poet\r\nmight suit you better."\r\n\r\n"What other?"\r\n\r\n"Some one less allegorical, at least."\r\n\r\n"I do not know that," said Hester.  "The most cunning allegory that ever\r\nwas devised is plain and easy in comparison with the simplest true\r\nstory,--fully told: and a man is a poet in proportion as he fully tells\r\na simple true story."\r\n\r\n"A story of the mind, you mean," said Mr Enderby, "not of the mere\r\nevents of life?"\r\n\r\n"Of the mind, of course, I mean.  Without the mind the mere life is\r\nnothing."\r\n\r\n"Is not allegory a very pretty way of telling such a story of the mind,\r\nunder the appearance of telling a story of a life?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Margaret; "and that is the reason why so many like allegory.\r\nThere is a pleasure in making one\'s way about a grotto in a garden; but\r\nI think there is a much higher one in exploring a cave on the sea-shore,\r\ndim and winding, where you never know that you have come to the end,--a\r\nmuch higher pleasure in exploring a life than following out an\r\nallegory."\r\n\r\n"You are a true lover of mystery, Miss Margaret.  You should have lived\r\na thousand years ago."\r\n\r\n"Thank you: I am very glad I did not.  But why so long ago?  Are there\r\nnot mysteries enough left?"\r\n\r\n"And will there not be enough a thousand years hence?" said Hester.\r\n\r\n"I am afraid not.  You and I cannot venture to speak upon what the\r\nGermans may be doing.  But these two ladies can tell us, perhaps,\r\nwhether they are not clearing everything up very fast;--making windows\r\nin your cave, Miss Margaret, till nobody will be afraid to look into\r\nevery cranny of it."\r\n\r\n"And then our complaint," said Miss Young, "will be like Mrs Howell\'s,\r\nwhen somebody told her that we were to have the Drummond light on every\r\nchurch steeple.  `Oh dear, ma\'am!\' said she, `we shall not know how in\r\nthe world to get any darkness.\'"\r\n\r\n"You speak as if you agreed that the Germans really are the makers of\r\nwindows that Mr Enderby supposes them," observed Margaret; "but you do\r\nnot think we are any nearer the end of mysteries than ever, do you?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no; not till we have struck our stone to the bottom of the\r\nuniverse, and walked round it: and I am not aware that the Germans\r\npretend to be able to do that, any more than other people.  Indeed, I\r\nthink there are as many makers of grottoes as explorers of caves among\r\nthem.  What do you want, my dear?"\r\n\r\nThis last was addressed to George, whose round face, red with exertion,\r\nappeared at a back window.  The little girls were hoisting him up, that\r\nhe might call out once more, "Uncle Philip, be sure you remember not to\r\ntell."\r\n\r\n"It would be a pity that mysteries should come to an end," observed Mr\r\nEnderby, "when they seem to please our human tastes so well.  See there,\r\nhow early the love of mystery begins! and who can tell where it ends?\r\nIs there one of your pupils, Miss Young, in whom you do not find it?"\r\n\r\n"Not one; but is there not a wide difference between the love of making\r\nmysteries, and a taste for finding them out?"\r\n\r\n"Do you not find both in children, and up into old age?"\r\n\r\n"In children, one usually finds both: but I think the love of\r\nmystery-making and surprises goes off as people grow wiser.  Fanny and\r\nMary were plotting all last week how to take their sister Sophia by\r\nsurprise with a piece of India-rubber, a token of fraternal affection,\r\nas they were pleased to call it; and you see George has a secret to-day:\r\nbut they will have fewer hidings and devices every year: and, if they\r\ngrow really wise, they will find that, amidst the actual business of\r\nlife, there is so much more safety, and ease, and blessing in perfect\r\nfrankness than in any kind of concealment, that they will give\r\nthemselves the liberty and peace of being open as the daylight.  Such is\r\nmy hope for them.  But all this need not prevent their delighting in the\r\nmysteries which are not of man\'s making."\r\n\r\n"They will be all the more at leisure for them," said Margaret, "from\r\nhaving their minds free from plots and secrets."\r\n\r\n"Surely you are rather hard upon arts and devices," said Philip.\r\n"Without more or fewer of them, we should make our world into a Palace\r\nof Truth,--see the Veillees du Chateau, which Matilda is reading with\r\nMiss Young.  Who ever read it, that did not think the Palace of Truth\r\nthe most disagreeable place in the world?"\r\n\r\n"And why?" asked Margaret.  "Not because the people in it spoke truth;\r\nbut because the truth which they spoke was hatred, and malice, and\r\nselfishness."\r\n\r\n"And how much better," inquired Hester, "is the truth that we should\r\nspeak, if we were as true as the daylight?  I hope we shall always be\r\nallowed to make mysteries of our own selfish and unkind fancies.  There\r\nwould be little mutual respect left if these things were told."\r\n\r\n"I think there would be more than ever," said Margaret, carefully\r\navoiding to meet her sister\'s eye.  "I think so many mistakes would be\r\nexplained, so many false impressions set right, on the instant of their\r\nbeing made, that our mutual relations would go on more harmoniously than\r\nnow."\r\n\r\n"And what would you do with the affairs now dedicated to mystery?" asked\r\nMr Enderby.  "How would you deal with diplomacy, and government, and\r\nwith courtship?  You surely would not overthrow the whole art of wooing?\r\nYou would not doom lovers\' plots and devices?"\r\n\r\nThe ladies were all silent.  Mr Enderby, however, was determined to\r\nhave an answer.  He addressed himself particularly to Margaret.\r\n\r\n"You do not disapprove of the little hidden tokens with which a man may\r\nmake his feelings secretly known where he wishes them to be\r\nunderstood;--tokens which may meet the eye of one alone, and carry no\r\nmeaning to any other!  You do not disapprove of a more gentle and\r\nmysterious way of saying, `I love you,\' than looking full in one\r\nanother\'s face, and declaiming it like a Quaker upon affirmation?  You\r\ndo not disapprove--"\r\n\r\n"As for disapproving," said Margaret, who chanced to perceive that\r\nMaria\'s hand shook so that she could not guide her needle, and that she\r\nwas therefore apparently searching for something in her work-box,--"as\r\nfor disapproving, I do not pretend to judge for other people--"\r\n\r\nShe stopped short, struck with the blunder she had made.  Mr Enderby\r\nhastened to take advantage of it.  He said, laughing:\r\n\r\n"Well, then, speak for yourself.  Never mind other people\'s case."\r\n\r\n"What I mean," said Margaret, with grave simplicity, "is, that all\r\ndepends upon the person whose regard is to be won.  There are silly\r\ngirls, and weak women, who, liking mysteries in other affairs, are best\r\npleased to be wooed with small artifices;--with having their vanity and\r\ntheir curiosity piqued with sly compliments--"\r\n\r\n"Sly compliments!  What an expression!"\r\n\r\n"Such women agree, as a matter of course, in the old notion,--suitable\r\nenough five centuries ago,--that the life of courtship should be as\r\nunlike as possible to married life.  But I certainly think those much\r\nthe wisest and the happiest, who look upon the whole affair as the\r\nsolemn matter that it really is, and who desire to be treated, from the\r\nbeginning, with the sincerity and seriousness which they will require\r\nafter they are married."\r\n\r\n"If the same simplicity and seriousness were common in this as are\r\nrequired in other grave transactions," said Hester, "there would be less\r\nof the treachery, delusion, and heart-breaking, which lie heavy upon the\r\nsouls of many a man and many a woman."\r\n\r\nMr Enderby, happening to be looking out of the window here, as if for\r\nsomething to say, caught the eye of his sister, who was walking in her\r\ngarden.  She beckoned to him, but he took no notice, not desiring to be\r\ndisturbed at present.  Turning again to Margaret, he said:\r\n\r\n"But you would destroy all the graces of courtship: you would--"\r\n\r\n"Nay," said Hester, "what is so graceful as the simplicity of entire\r\nmutual trust?--the more entire the more graceful."\r\n\r\n"I wish you had left out the word `trust.\'  You have spoiled something\r\nthat I was going on to say about the simplicity of drawing lots like the\r\nMoravians,--the most sincere courtship of all: but that word `trust\'\r\nputs my illustration aside.  You need not protest.  I assure you I am\r\nnot so dull as not to understand that you think love necessary to the\r\nwooing which seems graceful in your eyes;--Oh, yes: love, and mutual\r\nknowledge, and mutual reverence, and perfect trust!  Oh, yes, I\r\nunderstand it all."\r\n\r\n"Philip!" cried a soft, sentimental voice under the window:\r\n\r\n"Brother, I want your arm for a turn in the shrubbery."\r\n\r\nMrs Rowland\'s bonnet was visible as she looked up to the window.  She\r\nsaw the braids of the hair of the young ladies, and her voice was rather\r\nless soft as she called again, "Philip, do you hear?  I want you."\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to seem not to hear.  Mr Enderby was obliged to go:\r\nbut he left his hat behind him, as a sort of pledge that he meant to\r\nlimit himself to the single turn proposed.\r\n\r\nFor various reasons, the young ladies were all disinclined to speak\r\nafter he had left them.  Miss Young was the first to move.  She rose to\r\ngo to her desk for something,--the desk in which Margaret kept the books\r\nshe used in this place.  Ever on the watch to save Maria the trouble of\r\nmoving about, which was actual pain to her, Margaret flew to see if she\r\ncould not fetch what was wanted: but Miss Young was already looking into\r\nthe desk.  Her eye caught the pretty new little volume which lay there.\r\nShe took it up, found it was a volume of Tieck, and saw on the fly-leaf,\r\nin the well-known handwriting, "From PE."  One warm beam of hope shot\r\nthrough her heart:--how could it be otherwise,--the book lying in her\r\ndesk, and thus addressed?  But it was only one moment\'s joy.  The next\r\ninstant\'s reflection, and the sight of Margaret\'s German exercise, on\r\nwhich the book had lain, revealed the real case to her.  In sickness of\r\nheart, she would, upon impulse, have put back the book, and concealed\r\nthe incident: but she was not sure but that Margaret had seen the\r\nvolume, and she _was_ sure of what her own duty was.  With a smile and a\r\nsteady voice she held out the book to Margaret, and said:\r\n\r\n"Here is something for you, Margaret, which looks a little like one of\r\nthe hidden, and gentle, and mysterious tokens Mr Enderby has been\r\ntalking about.  Here it is, lying among your books; and I think it was\r\nnot with them when you last left your seat."\r\n\r\nMargaret blushed with an emotion which seemed to the one who knew her\r\nbest to be too strong to be mere surprise.  She looked doubtful for a\r\nmoment about the book being meant for her.  Its German aspect was\r\nconclusive against its being designed for Hester: but Miss Young,--was\r\nit certain that the volume was not hers?  She asked this; but Maria\r\nreplied, as her head was bent over her desk:\r\n\r\n"There is no doubt about it.  I am sure.  It is nobody\'s but yours."\r\n\r\nSome one proposed to resume the reading.  The `Hymn to Heavenly Beauty\'\r\nwas finished, but no remark followed.  Each was thinking of something\r\nelse.  More common subjects suited their present mood better.  It was\r\nurged upon Hester that she should be one of the daily party; and, her\r\nlonely fancies being for the hour dispersed, she agreed.\r\n\r\n"But," she observed, "other people\'s visits alter the case entirely.  I\r\ndo not see how study is to go on if any one may come in from either\r\nhouse, as Mr Enderby did to-day.  It is depriving Miss Young of her\r\nleisure, too, and making use of her apartment in a way that she may well\r\nobject to."\r\n\r\n"I am here, out of school hours, only upon sufferance," replied Miss\r\nYoung.  "I never call the room mine without this explanation."\r\n\r\n"Besides," said Margaret, "it is a mere accident Mr Enderby\'s coming in\r\nto-day.  If he makes a habit of it, we have only to tell him that we\r\nwant our time to ourselves."\r\n\r\nMiss Young knew better.  She made no reply; but she felt in her inmost\r\nsoul that her new-born pleasures were, from this moment, to be turned\r\ninto pains.  She knew Mr Enderby; and knowing him, foresaw that she was\r\nto be a witness of his wooings of another, whom she had just begun to\r\ntake to her heart.  This was to be her fate if she was strong enough for\r\nit,--strong enough to be generous in allowing to Margaret opportunities\r\nwhich could not without her be enjoyed, of fixing the heart of one whom\r\nshe could not pronounce to have been faulty towards herself.  His\r\nconversation today had gone far to make her suppose him blameless, and\r\nherself alone in fault; so complete had seemed his unconsciousness with\r\nregard to her.  Her duty then was clearly to give them up to each other,\r\nwith such spirit of self-sacrifice as she might be capable of.  If not\r\nstrong enough for this, the alternative was a daily painful retreat to\r\nher lodging, whence she might look out on the heaps of cinders in the\r\nfarrier\'s yard, her spirit abased the while with the experience of her\r\nown weakness.  Neither alternative was very cheering.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVEN.\r\n\r\nFAMILY CONFIDENCE.\r\n\r\n"When do you leave us, Philip?" inquired Mrs Rowland, putting her arm\r\nwithin her brother\'s, and marching him up the gravel-walk.\r\n\r\n"Do you wish me to go?" replied he, laughing.  "Is this what you were so\r\nanxious to say?"\r\n\r\n"Why, we understood, six weeks since, that you meant to leave Deerbrook\r\nin a fortnight: that is all."\r\n\r\n"So I did: but my mother is kind enough to be pleased that I am staying\r\nlonger; and since I am equally pleased myself, it is all very well.  I\r\nrather think, too, that the children consider Uncle Philip a good boy,\r\nwho deserves a holiday."\r\n\r\n"My mother!  Oh, she always supposes everything right that you do; and\r\nthat is the reason why Mr Rowland and I--"\r\n\r\n"The reason why Rowland and I agree so well," interrupted the brother.\r\n"Yes, that is one reason, among many.  Rowland\'s wish is to see the old\r\nlady happy; and she is naturally happiest when she has both her children\r\nwith her; and for every merry hour of hers, your good husband looks the\r\nmore kindly upon me."\r\n\r\n"Of course; all that is a matter of course; though you are not aware,\r\nperhaps, of the fatigue it is to my mother to have any one with her too\r\nlong a time.  She will not tell _you_; but you have no idea how low she\r\nis for some time after you go away, if you have stayed more than a few\r\ndays, from exhaustion--from pure exhaustion.  Ah! you do not perceive\r\nit, because the excitement keeps her up while you are here; and she\r\nnaturally makes an effort, you know.  But if you were to see her as we\r\ndo after you are gone;--you cannot think how it sets the Greys talking\r\nabout her low spirits."\r\n\r\n"Poor soul!  I wish I could be always with her.  I will try whether I\r\ncannot; for some time to come, at least.  But, sister, how does it\r\nhappen that neither you nor Rowland ever told me this before?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, we would not distress you unnecessarily.  We knew it was an\r\nunavoidable evil.  You cannot always be here, and you must--"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I must sometimes come: that is an unavoidable evil; and always\r\nwill be, sister, while I have a good old mother living here."\r\n\r\n"My dear Philip, how you do misunderstand one!  I never heard anything\r\nso odd."\r\n\r\n"Why odd?  Have you not been giving me to understand, all this time,\r\nthat you do not wish to have me here,--that you want me to go away?  If\r\nnot this, I do not know what you have been talking about."\r\n\r\n"What an idea!  My only brother!  What can you be thinking of?  Why upon\r\nearth should I wish you anywhere else?"\r\n\r\n"That you may manage my mother and her affairs all your own way, I\r\nimagine."\r\n\r\nMrs Rowland had nothing to oppose to this plain speech but\r\nexclamations.  When she had exhausted all she could muster, she avowed\r\nthat the only consideration which could reconcile her to the sacrifice\r\nof her dear brother\'s society was anxiety for his happiness.\r\n\r\n"Then, supposing I am happiest here, we are all satisfied."  And Uncle\r\nPhilip would have made a diversion from the path to give George his\r\nfavourite swing, quite up to the second branch of the great pear-tree.\r\n\r\n"Pray let George swing himself for once, brother.  Hold your tongue,\r\nGeorge!  You are a very troublesome boy, and your uncle and I are busy.\r\nIt is about your own affairs, brother, that I want to open my mind to\r\nyou.  As for your always remaining here, as you kindly hinted just\r\nnow--"\r\n\r\n"I did not mean to hint," said Philip; "I thought I had spoken quite\r\nplainly."\r\n\r\n"Well, well.  We all know how to appreciate the kindness of your\r\nintentions, I am sure: but your happiness must not be sacrificed to the\r\ngood of any of us here.  We can take care of one another: but, as it is\r\nimpossible that you should find a companion for life here, and as it is\r\ntime you were thinking of settling, we must not be selfish, and detain\r\nyou among us when you should be creating an interest elsewhere.  Mr\r\nRowland and I are extremely anxious to see you happily married, brother;\r\nand indeed we feel it is time you were thinking about it."\r\n\r\n"I am glad of that, sister.  I am somewhat of the same opinion myself."\r\n\r\n"I rejoice to hear it," replied the lady, in a rather uneasy tone.  "We\r\nhave been delighted to hear of these frequent visits of yours to the\r\nBuchanans\'.  There is a strong attraction there, I fancy, Philip."\r\n\r\n"Joe Buchanan is the attraction to me there.  If you mean Caroline, she\r\nhas been engaged these three years to her brother\'s friend, Annesley."\r\n\r\n"You do not say so!  But you did not know it?"\r\n\r\n"I have known it these two years, under the seal of secrecy.  Ah!\r\nsister, I have had many an hour\'s amusement at your schemes on my behalf\r\nabout Caroline Buchanan."\r\n\r\n"I have been quite out, I see.  When do you go to the Bruces\', to make\r\nthe visit you were disappointed of at Christmas?"\r\n\r\n"When they return from the Continent, where they are gone for three\r\nyears.  Miss Mary is out of reach for three years, sister."\r\n\r\n"Out of reach!  You speak as if Paris,--or Rome, if you will,--was in\r\nAustralia.  And even in Australia one can hardly speak of people being\r\nout of reach."\r\n\r\n"If one wishes to overtake them," said Mr Enderby: "whereas, I can wait\r\nvery well for the Bruces till they come home again.  Now, no more,\r\nsister!  I cannot stand and hear the young ladies of my acquaintance\r\ncatalogued as a speculation for my advantage.  I could not look them in\r\nthe face again after having permitted it."\r\n\r\n"There is somebody in the schoolroom, I declare!" cried the lady, as if\r\nastonished.  And she stood looking from afar at the summer-house, in\r\nwhich three heads were distinctly visible.\r\n\r\n"Were you not aware of that before?  Did you suppose I was asleep there,\r\nor writing poetry all alone, or what?  The Miss Ibbotsons are there, and\r\nMiss Young."\r\n\r\n"You remind me," said the lady, "of something that I declared to Mr\r\nRowland that I would speak to you about.  My dear brother, you should\r\nhave some compassion on the young ladies you fall in with."\r\n\r\n"I thought your great anxiety just now was that the young ladies should\r\nhave compassion upon me."\r\n\r\n"One, Philip; the right one.  But you really have no mercy.  You are too\r\nmodest to be aware of the mischief you may be doing.  But let me entreat\r\nyou not to turn the head of a girl whom you cannot possibly think\r\nseriously of."\r\n\r\n"Whom do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"You may be making even more mischief than flattering the poor girl with\r\nvain hopes.  If you once let it get into the heads of the Greys that any\r\none belonging to us could think of marrying into their connection, you\r\ndo not know the trouble you will impose upon Mr Rowland and me."\r\n\r\n"Does Rowland say so?"\r\n\r\n"Does he say so? one would think--Dear me! brother, there is nothing one\r\nmight not think from your manner.  You terrify me."\r\n\r\n"Have you a pocket-mirror about you?" asked Philip.  "I should like to\r\nsee what this terrible manner of mine is like."\r\n\r\n"Now, pray, no joking, Philip.  I declare my nerves will not bear it.\r\nBut I tell you what, Philip: if you let your old admiration of beauty\r\ncarry you away, and make you forget yourself so far as to dream of\r\nmarrying into that connection, you will repent it as long as you live.\r\nI shall never forgive you; and you will kill our poor dear mother."\r\n\r\n"I will ask her whether she thinks so," said Philip, "and I give you my\r\nword of honour that I will not kill my mother."\r\n\r\n"Girls seem to think that beauty is everything," continued the angry\r\nlady, "and so do their connections for them.  I declare Mrs Grey sits\r\nwinking at my mother when Miss Ibbotson has a colour, as if nobody ever\r\nsaw a good complexion before.  I declare it makes me sick.  Now, Philip,\r\nyou have been fairly warned; and if you fall into the trap, you will not\r\ndeserve any consideration from me."\r\n\r\n"I have let you lay down the law to me, sister, in your own way, because\r\nI know your way.  Say what you please to me of myself and my affairs,\r\nand a joke is the worst that will come of it.  But I tell you gravely,\r\nthat I will not hear of traps--I will not hear imputations like those\r\nyou have just spoken against these young ladies or their connections,\r\nwithout rebuke.  You can know nothing of the Miss Ibbotsons which can\r\njustify this conversation."\r\n\r\n"I shall soon believe you are in love," cried the lady, in high\r\nresentment.\r\n\r\n"Only take care what grounds you go upon before you speak and act,\r\nsister.  In my turn, I give you fair warning how you take any measures\r\nagainst them, even in your own inmost mind, without being quite sure\r\nwhat you are about."\r\n\r\n"You do not say now that you do not mean to have that girl?" cried Mrs\r\nRowland, fixing her fiery eyes upon her brother\'s face.\r\n\r\n"Why should I?  You have not set about obtaining my confidence in any\r\nway which could succeed.  If I am in love, it would not be easy to own\r\nit upon such unwarrantable pressure.  If I am not in love--"\r\n\r\n"Ah!  If you are not--"\r\n\r\n"In that case I am disinclined to make my not caring for them the\r\ncondition, on which those young ladies may receive your civilities.\r\nThese civilities are due to them, whatever I may feel or intend; and my\r\nrespect for them is such that I shall keep my mind to myself."\r\n\r\n"At least," said the lady, somewhat humbled, "do not be so much with\r\nthem.  For my sake, do not go into the schoolroom again."\r\n\r\n"I am sorry I cannot oblige you," said he, smiling, "but I must go at\r\nthis moment:--not to sit down,--not to speak five words, however,--but\r\nonly to get my hat.  I have to go into the village, on an errand for the\r\nchildren.  Can I do anything for you in the village?"\r\n\r\n"She thinks only of Hester, it is plain," thought he.  "If I am to have\r\nany more lectures and advice, I hope they will proceed on the same\r\nsupposition: it will make my part easier, and save my being driven to\r\nassert my own will, and so plunging poor Priscilla into hysterics.  I\r\ncan bear her interference, as long as Margaret\'s name is not on her\r\nlips.  The moment she casts an evil eye on her, I shall speak to\r\nRowland; which I had much rather avoid.  It would be delicious, too, to\r\nbe _her_ protector, without her knowing it,--to watch over her as she\r\nwalks in her bright innocence,--to shield her--but from whom?  From my\r\nown sister?  No! no! better keep her out of suspicion: better let it\r\npass that it is really Hester.  Hester has plenty of friends to stand by\r\nher.  The Greys are so proud of her beauty, they have no eyes or ears\r\nbut for her.  People who meddle with concerns they have no business\r\nwith, are strangely blind,--they make odd mistakes, from running away\r\nwith notions of their own, prepared beforehand.  Here is everybody\r\ndetermined that we shall all fall in love with Hester.  Priscilla has\r\njumped to her conclusion at once,--perhaps in emulation of Mrs Grey.\r\nMrs Grey has clearly given Hester to Hope, in her own mind.  I rather\r\nthink Hope would be obliged to her if she would not show so plainly what\r\nis in her thoughts.  I fear so,--I may be jealous,--but I am afraid Hope\r\nand I are too much of the same mind about these girls.  I will stand up\r\nfor Mrs Grey, as long as I live, if she proves right here.  She shall\r\nwink and nod for evermore, and I will justify her, if Hope turns out to\r\nbe in love with Hester.  I will be the first to congratulate him, if he\r\nsucceeds with her: and really he would be a happy fellow.  She is a\r\nlovely creature; and how she will love whenever she does love!  She\r\nwould be a devoted wife.  Why cannot he see the matter so, and leave my\r\nMargaret to me?  Now, how will she look up as I go in?"\r\n\r\nHis vision of Margaret\'s looks remained a vision.  No one was in the\r\nschoolroom but Miss Young, writing a letter.\r\n\r\n"They are not here!" said Mr Enderby.\r\n\r\n"No; they are gone with Mrs Grey into the village, I believe."\r\n\r\n"Oh, well, I only came for my hat.  You are in the children\'s secret, of\r\ncourse, Miss Young?"\r\n\r\n"About their feast.  Yes, I believe I know all about it."\r\n\r\n"I am going to ask some important questions for them at the\r\nconfectioner\'s.  You will not object to my bringing them a few good\r\nthings?"\r\n\r\n"I?  Oh, no."\r\n\r\n"I would not act in so serious a matter without asking you.  Can I be of\r\nany use to you in the village?  Or perhaps you may want some pens mended\r\nbefore I go?"\r\n\r\n"No, I thank you."\r\n\r\n"Then I will not interrupt your letter any longer.  Good morning."\r\n\r\nIt was a wonder that the letter was written at all.  When Maria had done\r\nleaning back in her chair, and had taken up her pen again, she was\r\ndisturbed by painful sounds from Mrs Rowland\'s garden.  The lady\'s own\r\nMatilda, and precious George, and darling Anna, were now pronounced to\r\nbe naughty, wilful, mischievous, and, finally, to be combined together\r\nto break their mamma\'s heart.  It was clear that they were receiving the\r\ndischarge of the wrath which was caused by somebody else.  Now a wail,\r\nnow a scream of passion, went to Maria\'s heart.  She hastened on with\r\nher letter, in the hope that Mrs Rowland would presently go into the\r\nhouse, when the little sufferers might be invited into the schoolroom,\r\nto hear a story, or have their ruffled tempers calmed by some other such\r\nsimple means.\r\n\r\n"What a life of discipline this is!" thought Maria.  "We all have it,\r\nsooner or later.  These poor children are beginning early.  If one can\r\nbut help them through it!  There she goes in, and shuts the door behind\r\nher!  Now I may call them hither, and tell them something or another\r\nabout Una and her lion."\r\n\r\nAt the well-known sound of Miss Young\'s lame step, the little ones all\r\ncame about her.  One ashamed face was hid on her shoulder; another was\r\nrelieved of its salt tears; and the boy\'s pout was first relaxed, and\r\nthen forgotten.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHT.\r\n\r\nFAMILY CORRESPONDENCE.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of the great event of the arrival of the Miss Ibbotsons,\r\nMr Hope had longed to communicate all connected with it to his family.\r\nAs often as Hester looked eminently beautiful, he wished his sisters\r\ncould see her.  As often as he felt his spirit moved and animated by his\r\nconversations with Margaret, he thought of Frank, and wished that the\r\npoor fellow could for a day exchange the heats and fatigues, and vapid\r\nsociety, of which he complained as accompaniments of service in India,\r\nfor some one of the wood and meadow rambles, or garden frolics, which\r\nwere the summer pleasures of Deerbrook, now unspeakably enhanced by the\r\naddition lately made to its society.  Frank wrote that the very names of\r\nmeadows and kine, of cowslips, trout, and harriers, were a refreshment\r\nto a soldier\'s fancy, when the heats, and the solitude of spirit in\r\nwhich he was compelled to live, made him weary of the novelties which\r\nhad at first pleased him in the East.  He begged that Edward would go on\r\nto write as he did of everything that passed in the village--of\r\neverything which could make him for a whole evening fancy himself in\r\nDeerbrook, and repose himself in its shacks and quietness.  Mr Hope had\r\nfelt, for a month past, that such a letter was by this time due to\r\nFrank, and that he had, for once, failed in punctuality: but he now, for\r\nthe first time, found it difficult to get time to write.  He never\r\ndreamed of sending Frank letters, which would be esteemed by others of a\r\nmoderate length.  When he did write, it was an epistle indeed: and\r\nduring this particular May and June, there was always something\r\nhappening which prevented his having his hours to himself.  In other\r\nwords, he was always at the Greys\' when not engaged in his professional\r\nduties.  The arrival of a letter from Frank one day gave him the\r\nnecessary stimulus, and he sat down on the instant to open his heart to\r\nhis brother.\r\n\r\nFrank was his younger and only brother, and the person in the world most\r\ndeeply indebted to him.  Their parents being dead, it was Edward who had\r\nbeen Frank\'s dependence as he grew up.  It was Edward who had, at great\r\ncost and pains, gratified his wish to go into the army, and had procured\r\nhim the best educational advantages in preparation for a military life.\r\nIt was Edward who had always treated him with such familiar friendship,\r\nthat he had scarcely felt as if he wanted any other intimate, and who\r\nseemed to forget the five years\' difference of age between them at all\r\ntimes but when it afforded a reason for pressing kindness and assistance\r\nupon him.  The confidence between them was as familiar and entire as if\r\nthey had been twin-brothers.  The epistle which Frank was to have the\r\nbenefit of, on the present occasion, was even longer than usual, from\r\nthe delay which had caused an accumulation of tidings and of thoughts.\r\n\r\n  "Deerbrook, _June 20th_, 18--.\r\n\r\n  "Dear Frank,--Your letter of December last has arrived to remind me\r\n  how far I am past my time in writing to you.  I make no apologies for\r\n  my delay, however, and I do not pretend to feel any remorse about it.\r\n  We never write to one another from a mere sense of duty; and long may\r\n  it be before we do so!  Unless we write because we cannot help it,\r\n  pray let us let it alone.  As for the reasons why my inclination to\r\n  talk to you has not overpowered all impediments till now,--you shall\r\n  have them by-and-by.  Meanwhile, here, before your eyes, is the proof\r\n  that I cannot but spend this June evening with you.\r\n\r\n  "You ask about your grandfather; and I have somewhat to say to you\r\n  about him.  He is still living,--very infirm, as you may suppose, but,\r\n  I think, as clear in mind as I have ever known him.  He sent for me\r\n  two months ago, as you will have heard from the letter I find he\r\n  caused to be written to you about the business which then occupied his\r\n  mind.  My share in that business he would represent to you as it\r\n  appeared to him: but I must give you an account of it as it appears to\r\n  myself.  He sent for me to take leave of me, as he said; but, in my\r\n  opinion, to receive my acknowledgments for his latest disposition of\r\n  his property by will.  The new arrangements did not please me at all;\r\n  and I am confident that you would have liked them no better than I;\r\n  and I wished not a little that you were nearer, that we might have\r\n  acted together.  I know that he once intended to divide his property\r\n  equally among us four; but of late, from some unaccountable feeling of\r\n  indifference about Emily and Anne, or, as is more likely, from some\r\n  notion about women not wanting money, and not knowing how to manage\r\n  it, he has changed his mind, and destined his money for you and me,\r\n  leaving my sisters only a hundred pounds each as a remembrance.  He\r\n  informed me of this, as soon as I arrived.  I thought him quite well\r\n  enough to hear reason, and I spoke my mind plainly to him.  I had no\r\n  right to answer for you, any further than for your sense of justice,\r\n  and your affection for your sisters.  The way in which the matter was\r\n  settled at last, therefore, with great pains and trouble, was, that\r\n  you and our sisters share equally, and that I have the legacy of 100\r\n  pounds, which was destined for one of them.  The reasons why I\r\n  declined a fourth part of the property were sufficient to my mind, and\r\n  will be so, I doubt not, to yours.  Out of this property I have had my\r\n  professional education, while you and my sisters have received nothing\r\n  at all.  This professional education has enabled me to provide\r\n  sufficiently for myself, so far, and this provision will in all\r\n  probability go on to increase; while my sisters want as much as can\r\n  fairly be put into their hands.  Their husbands are not likely ever to\r\n  be rich men, and will probably be poor for some years to come.  Their\r\n  children have to be educated; and in short, there is every reason why\r\n  Emily and Anne should have this money, and none why I should.  I am\r\n  afraid the old gentleman is not very well pleased with my way of\r\n  receiving what he intended for kindness; but that cannot be helped.\r\n  If he falls back into his previous state of mind, and leaves the\r\n  whole, after all, to you and me, I shall set the matter right, as far\r\n  as I can, by dividing my portion between my sisters: and I feel\r\n  confident that you will do the same; but I earnestly hope this will\r\n  not happen.  It will be a very different thing to my sisters receiving\r\n  this money by their grandfather\'s will as their due, and from our\r\n  hands as a gift--(the way in which they will look at it).  The letter\r\n  to you was sent off without delay, in order that, in case of any\r\n  dissatisfaction whatever on your part, your wishes might have the\r\n  better chance of being made known to us during the old gentleman\'s\r\n  life.  I doubt not that your thoughts, whatever they may be, will be\r\n  on the way to me before this reaches you; and I can have as little\r\n  doubt what they are.  You know Mr Blunt says, that men are created to\r\n  rob their sisters,--a somewhat partial view of the objects and\r\n  achievements of mortal existence, it must be owned, and a statement\r\n  which I conceive the course of your life, for one, will not go to\r\n  confirm; but a man must have had a good deal of experience, of what he\r\n  is talking of, before he could make so sweeping a generalisation from\r\n  the facts of life; and I am afraid Mr Blunt has some reason for what\r\n  he says.  Medical men receive many confidences in sick rooms, you\r\n  know; and some, among others, which had better be reserved for the\r\n  lawyer.  What I have seen in this way leads me to imagine that my\r\n  grandfather\'s notion is a very common one,--that women have little\r\n  occasion for money, and do not know how to manage it; and that their\r\n  property is to be drawn upon to the very last, to meet the\r\n  difficulties and supply the purposes of their brothers.  On the utter\r\n  injustice and absurdity of such a notion there can be no disagreement\r\n  between you and me; nor, I imagine, in our actions with regard to it.\r\n\r\n  "I heard from Emily yesterday.  The letter is more than half full of\r\n  stories about the children, and accounts of her principles and plans\r\n  with regard to them.  She writes on the same subjects to you, no\r\n  doubt, for her heart is full of them.  Her husband finds the post of\r\n  consul at a little Spanish port rather a dull affair, as we\r\n  anticipated, and groans at the mention of Bristol or Liverpool\r\n  shipping, he says.  But I like the tone of his postscript very well.\r\n  He is thankful for the honest independence his office affords him, and\r\n  says he can tolerate his Spanish neighbours (though they are as\r\n  ignorant as Turkish ladies), for the sake of his family, and of the\r\n  hope of returning, sooner or later, to live in his own country, after\r\n  having discharged his duty to his children.  Theirs must be an irksome\r\n  life enough, as much of it as is passed out of their own doors: but\r\n  they seem to be finding out that it is not so much the _where_ and the\r\n  _how_, as the _what_ people are, that matters to their peace of mind;\r\n  and I suppose those who love each other, and have settled what they\r\n  are living for, can attain what they most want, nearly so well in one\r\n  place as another.\r\n\r\n  "Poor Anne wrote to _you_, I know, after the death of her infant--her\r\n  little Highlandman, as she proudly called him in her last letter\r\n  before she lost him.  Gilchrist talked last year of bringing her and\r\n  his boy south this summer, and I had some hopes of seeing them all\r\n  here: but I have not been able to get them to speak again of\r\n  travelling, and I give it up for this year.  I hope your letters and\r\n  theirs fall due seasonably; that your reports of all your devices to\r\n  cool yourself, reach them in the depth of their Caithness winter; and\r\n  that all they say to you of their snow-drifts and freshets is\r\n  acceptable when you are panting in the hottest of your noons.  Anne\r\n  writes more cheerfully than she did, and Gilchrist says she is\r\n  exerting herself to overcome her sorrow.  Their love must be passing\r\n  strange in the eyes of all such as despised Anne\'s match.  It is such\r\n  as should make Anne\'s brothers feel very cordially towards Gilchrist.\r\n  We have drifted asunder in life rather strangely, when one comes to\r\n  think of it; and our anchorage grounds are pretty far apart.  Who\r\n  would have thought it, when we four used to climb the old apple-tree\r\n  together, and drop down from the garden wall?  I wonder whether we\r\n  shall ever contrive to meet in one house once more, and whether I may\r\n  be honoured by my house being the place?  It is possible; and I spend\r\n  certain of my dreams upon the project.  Do you not find that one\r\n  effect of this wide separation is, to make one fancy the world smaller\r\n  than one used to think it?  You, on the other side of it, probably\r\n  waked up to this conviction long ago.  It is just opening upon me,\r\n  shut up in my nook of our little island.  When I have a letter from\r\n  you, like that which lies before me, spiced with an old family joke or\r\n  two, and a good many new ones of your own, all exactly like yourself,\r\n  I am persuaded you cannot be very far off; and I should certainly call\r\n  you from my window to come in to tea, but from a disagreeable\r\n  suspicion that I should get no answer.  But do tell me in your next\r\n  whether our globe has not been made far too much of its children, and\r\n  whether its oceans do not look very like ponds, when you cast your eye\r\n  over them to that small old apple-tree I mentioned just now.\r\n\r\n  "But you want news,--this being the place of all others to send to\r\n  from the other side of the world for news.  Deerbrook has rung with\r\n  news and rumours of news since winter.  The first report after the ice\r\n  broke up in March was, that I was going to be married to Deborah\r\n  Giles.  `Who is Deborah Giles?\' you will ask.  She is not going to be\r\n  a relation of yours, in the first place.  Secondly, she is the\r\n  daughter of the boatman whose boats Enderby and I are wont to hire.\r\n  The young lady may be all that ever woman was, for aught I know, for I\r\n  never spoke to her in my life, except that I one day asked her for\r\n  something to bale the boat with: but I heard that the astonishment of\r\n  Deerbrook was, that I was engaged to a woman who could not read or\r\n  write.  So you see we of Deerbrook follow our old pastime of first\r\n  inventing marvels, and then being scarcely able to believe them.  I\r\n  rather suspect that we have some wag among us who fabricates news, to\r\n  see how much will be received and retailed: but perhaps these rumours,\r\n  even the wildest of them, rise `by natural exhalation\' from the nooks\r\n  and crevices of village life.  My five years\' residence has not\r\n  qualified me to pronounce absolutely upon this.\r\n\r\n  "Old Smithson is dead.  You could not have seen him half-a-dozen times\r\n  when you were here; but you may chance to recollect him,--a short old\r\n  man, with white hair, and deep-set grey eyes.  He is less of a loss to\r\n  the village than almost any other man would be.  He was so shy and\r\n  quiet, and kept so much within his own gate, that some fancied he must\r\n  be a miser: but though he spent little on himself, his money made its\r\n  way abroad, and his heirs are rather disappointed at finding the\r\n  property no larger than when he came into it.  He is much missed by\r\n  his household, and, I own, by myself.  I was not often with him: but\r\n  it was something to feel that there was one among us who was free from\r\n  ambition and worldly cares, content to live on in the enjoyment of\r\n  humble duties and simple pleasures,--one who would not have changed\r\n  colour at the news of a bequest of ten thousand pounds, but could be\r\n  very eager about his grand-nephew\'s prize at school, and about the\r\n  first forget-me-not of the season beside his pond, and the first\r\n  mushroom in his meadow.  During the fortnight of his illness, the\r\n  village inquired about him; but when it was all over, there was not\r\n  much to forget of one so little known, and we hear of him no more.\r\n\r\n  "The Greys and Rowlands go on much as usual, the gentlemen of the\r\n  family agreeing very well, and the ladies rather the reverse.  The\r\n  great grievance this spring has been, that Mrs Rowland has seen fit\r\n  to enlarge her hall, and make a porch to her door.  Her neighbours are\r\n  certain that, in the course of her alterations, every principal beam\r\n  of her house has been cut through, and that the whole will fall in.\r\n  No such catastrophe has yet occurred, however.  I have not been called\r\n  in to set any broken bones; and I have not much expectation of an\r\n  accident, as Mr Rowland understands building too well to allow his\r\n  house to be cut down over his head.  As for the porch, I do not\r\n  perceive what can be alleged to its disadvantage, but that some people\r\n  think it ugly.\r\n\r\n  "Here I must cease my gossip.  I regularly begin my letters with the\r\n  intention of telling you all that I hear and see out of my profession\r\n  but I invariably stop short, as I do now, from disgust at the nonsense\r\n  I should have to write.  It is endurable enough to witness; for one\r\n  thing quickly dismisses another, and some relief occurs from the more\r\n  amiable or intellectual qualities of the parties concerned: but I hate\r\n  detail in writing; and I never do get through the whole list of\r\n  particulars that I believe you would like to have.  You must excuse me\r\n  now, and take my word for it, in the large, that we are all pretty\r\n  much what we were when you saw us three years ago, except of course,\r\n  being three years older, and some few of us three years wiser.  It\r\n  will be a satisfaction to you also to know that my practice has made a\r\n  very good growth for the time.  You liked my last year\'s report of it.\r\n  It has increased more since that time than even during the preceding\r\n  year; and I have no further anxiety about my worldly prospects.  I am\r\n  as well satisfied with my choice of an occupation in life as ever.\r\n  Mine has its anxieties, and _desagremens_, as others have: but I am\r\n  convinced I could not have chosen better.  You saw, when you were with\r\n  me, something of the anxiety of responsibility; what it is, for\r\n  instance, to await the one or the other event of a desperate case: and\r\n  I could tell you a good deal that you do not and cannot know of the\r\n  perils, and troubles attendant upon being the depository of so much\r\n  domestic and personal confidence as my function imposes upon me the\r\n  necessity of receiving.  I sometimes long to be able to see nothing\r\n  but what is apparent to all in society; to perceive what is\r\n  ostensible, and to dream of nothing more,--not exactly like children,\r\n  but like the members of large and happy families, who carry about with\r\n  them the purity and peace of their homes, and therefore take\r\n  cognisance of the pure and peaceful only whom they meet abroad; but it\r\n  is childish, or indolent, or cowardly, to desire this.  While there is\r\n  private vice and wretchedness, and domestic misunderstanding, one\r\n  would desire to know it, if one can do anything to cure or alleviate\r\n  it.  Dr Levitt and I have the same feeling about this; and I\r\n  sometimes hope that we mutually prepare for and aid each other\'s work.\r\n  There is a bright side to our business, as I need not tell you.  The\r\n  mere exercise of our respective professions, the scientific as well as\r\n  the moral interest of them, is as much to us as the theory of your\r\n  business to you; and that is saying a great deal.  You will not\r\n  quarrel with the idea of the scientific interest of Dr Levitt\'s\r\n  profession in his hands; for you know how learned he is in the complex\r\n  science of Humanity.  You remember the eternal wonder of the Greys at\r\n  his liberality towards dissenters.  Of that liberality he is\r\n  unconscious: as it is the natural, the inevitable result of his\r\n  knowledge of men,--of his having been `hunting the waterfalls\' from\r\n  his youth up,--following up thought and prejudice to their fountains.\r\n  When I see him bland and gay amongst us, I feel pretty confident that\r\n  his greatest pleasure is the same as mine,--that of reposing in the\r\n  society of the innocent, the single-hearted, the unburdened, after\r\n  having seen what the dark corners of social life are.  It is like\r\n  coming out of a foetid cave into the evening sunshine.  Of late, we\r\n  have felt this in an extraordinary degree.  But I must tell you in an\r\n  orderly way what has happened to us.  I have put off entering upon the\r\n  grand subject, partly from the pleasure of keeping one\'s best news for\r\n  the last, and partly from shyness in beginning to describe what it is\r\n  impossible that you should enter into.  I am well aware of your powers\r\n  of imagination and sympathy: but you have not lived five years within\r\n  five miles of a country village; and you can no more understand our\r\n  present condition than we can appreciate your sherbet and your\r\n  mountain summer-house.\r\n\r\n  "There are two ladies here from Birmingham, so far beyond any ladies\r\n  that we have to boast of, that some of us begin to suspect that\r\n  Deerbrook is not the Athens and Arcadia united that we have been\r\n  accustomed to believe it.  You can have no idea how our vanity is\r\n  mortified, and our pride abased, by finding what the world can produce\r\n  out of the bounds of Deerbrook.  We bear our humiliation wonderfully,\r\n  however.  Our Verdon woods echo with laughter; and singing is heard\r\n  beside the brook.  The voices of children, grown and ungrown, go up\r\n  from all the meadows around; and wit and wisdom are wafted over the\r\n  surface of our river at eventide.  The truth is, these girls have\r\n  brought in a new life among us, and there is not one of us, except the\r\n  children, that is not some years younger for their presence.  Mr Grey\r\n  deserts his business for them, like a school-boy; and Mr Rowland\r\n  watches his opportunity to play truant in turn.  Mrs Enderby gives\r\n  dances, and looks quite disposed to lead off in person.  Mrs\r\n  Plumstead has grown quite giddy about sorting the letters, and her\r\n  voice has not been heard further than three doors off since the\r\n  arrival of the strangers.  Dr Levitt is preaching his old sermons.\r\n  Mrs Grey is well-nigh intoxicated with being the hostess of these\r\n  ladies, and has even reached the point of allowing her drawing-room to\r\n  be used every afternoon.  Enderby is a fixture while they are so.\r\n  Neither mother, sister, friend, nor frolic, ever detained him here\r\n  before for a month together.  He was going away in a fortnight when\r\n  these ladies came: they have been here six weeks, and Enderby has\r\n  dropped all mention of the external world.  If you ask, as you are at\r\n  this moment doing in your own heart, how I stand under this influence,\r\n  I really cannot tell you.  I avoid inquiring too closely.  I enjoy\r\n  every passing day too much to question it, and I let it go; and so\r\n  must you.\r\n\r\n  "`But who are they?\' you want to know.  They are distant cousins of\r\n  Mr Grey\'s,--orphans, and in mourning for their father.  They are just\r\n  above twenty, and their name is Ibbotson.  `Are they handsome?\' is\r\n  your next question.  The eldest, Hester, is beautiful as the evening\r\n  star.  Margaret is very different.  It does not matter what she is as\r\n  to beauty, for the question seems never to have entered her own mind.\r\n  I doubt whether it has often occurred to her whether she can be this,\r\n  or that, or the other.  She _is_, and there is an end of the matter.\r\n  Such pure _existence_, without question, without introspection,\r\n  without hesitation or consciousness, I never saw in any one above\r\n  eight years old.  Yet she is wise; it becomes not me to estimate how\r\n  wise.  You will ask how I know this already.  I knew it the first day\r\n  I saw them; I knew it by her infinite simplicity, from which all\r\n  selfishness is discharged, and into which no folly can enter.  The\r\n  airs of heaven must have been about her from her infancy, to nourish\r\n  such health of the soul.  What her struggle is to be in life I cannot\r\n  conceive, for not a morbid tendency is to be discerned.  I suppose she\r\n  may be destined to make mistakes,--to find her faith deceived, her\r\n  affections rebuked, her full repose delayed.  If, like the rest of us,\r\n  she be destined to struggle, it must be to conflict of this kind; for\r\n  it is inconceivable that any should arise from herself.  Yet is she as\r\n  truly human as the weakest of us,--engrossed by affection, and\r\n  susceptible of passion.  Her affection for her sister is a sort of\r\n  passion.  It has some of the features of the serene guardianship of\r\n  one from on high; but it is yet more like the passionate servitude--of\r\n  the benefited to a benefactor, for instance--which is perhaps the most\r\n  graceful attitude in which our humanity appears.  Where are the words\r\n  that can tell what it is to witness, day by day, the course of such a\r\n  life as this?--to see, living and moving before one\'s eyes, the very\r\n  spirit that one had caught glimpses of, wandering in the brightest\r\n  vistas of one\'s imagination, in the holiest hours of thought!  Yet is\r\n  there nothing fearful, as in the presence of a spirit; there is\r\n  scarcely even a sense of awe, so childlike is her deportment.  I go,\r\n  grave and longing to listen; I come away, and I find I have been\r\n  talking more than any one; revealing, discussing, as if I were the\r\n  teacher and not the learner,--you will say the worshipper.  Say it if\r\n  you will.  Our whole little world worships the one or the other.\r\n  Hester is also well worthy of worship.  If there were nothing but her\r\n  beauty, she would have a wider world than ours of Deerbrook at her\r\n  feet.  But she has much more.  She is what you would call a true\r\n  woman.  She has a generous soul, strong affections, and a\r\n  susceptibility which interferes with her serenity.  She is not exempt\r\n  from the trouble and snare into which the lot of women seems to drive\r\n  them,--too close a contemplation of self, too nice a sensitiveness,\r\n  which yet does not interfere with devotedness to others.  She will be\r\n  a devoted wife: but Margaret does not wait to be a wife to be devoted.\r\n  Her life has been devotedness, and will be to the end.  If she were\r\n  left the last of her race, she would spend her life in worshipping the\r\n  unseen that lay about her, and would be as unaware of herself as now.\r\n\r\n  "What a comfort it is to speak freely of them!  This is the first\r\n  relief of the kind I have had.  Every one is praising them; every one\r\n  is following them: but to whom but you can I speak of them?  Even to\r\n  you, I filled my first sheet with mere surface matter.  I now wonder\r\n  how I could.  As for the `general opinion\' of Deerbrook on the\r\n  engrossing subject of the summer, you will anticipate it in your own\r\n  mind,--concluding that Hester is most worshipped, on account of her\r\n  beauty, and that Margaret\'s influence must be too subtle and refined\r\n  to operate on more than a few.  This is partly, but not wholly the\r\n  case.  It has been taken for granted from the beginning, by the many,\r\n  that Hester is to be exclusively the adored; and Enderby has, I fancy,\r\n  as many broad hints as myself of this general conclusion.  But I\r\n  question whether Enderby assents, any more than myself.  Margaret\'s\r\n  influence may be received as unconsciously as it is exerted, but it is\r\n  not, therefore, the less real, while it is the more potent.  I see old\r\n  Jem Bird raise himself up from the churchyard bench by his staff, and\r\n  stand uncovered as Hester passes by; I see the children in the road\r\n  touch one another, and look up at her; I see the admiration which\r\n  diffuses itself like sunshine around her steps: all this homage to\r\n  Hester is visible enough.  But I also see Sydney Grey growing manly,\r\n  and his sisters amiable, under Margaret\'s eye.  I fancy I perceive\r\n  Enderby--But that is his own affair.  I am sure I daily witness one\r\n  healing and renovating process which Margaret is unconsciously\r\n  effecting.  There is no one of us so worthy of her, so capable of\r\n  appreciating her, as Maria Young: they are friends, and Maria Young is\r\n  becoming a new creature.  Health and spirit are returning to that poor\r\n  girl\'s countenance: there is absolutely a new tone in her voice, and a\r\n  joyous strain in her conversation, which I, for one, never recognised\r\n  before.  It is a sight on which angels might look down, to see\r\n  Margaret, with her earnest face, listening humbly, and lovingly\r\n  serving the infirm and much-tried friend whom she herself is daily\r\n  lifting up into life and gladness.  I have done with listening to\r\n  abuse of life and the world.  I will never sit still under it again.\r\n  If there are two such as these sisters, springing out of the bosom of\r\n  a busy town, and quietly passing along their path of life, casting\r\n  sanctity around them as they go,--if there are two such, why not more?\r\n  If God casts such seeds of goodness into our nook, how do we know but\r\n  that he is sowing the whole earth with it?  I will believe it\r\n  henceforth.\r\n\r\n  "You will wonder, as I have wondered many a time within the last six\r\n  weeks, what is to become of us when we lose these strangers.  I can\r\n  only say, `God help us!\'  But that time is far off.  They came for\r\n  several months, and no one hints at their departure yet.  They are the\r\n  most unlearned creatures about country life that you can conceive,\r\n  with a surpassing genius for country pleasures.  Only imagine the\r\n  charm of our excursions!  They are never so happy as when in the\r\n  fields or on the river; and we all feel ourselves only too blest in\r\n  being able to indulge them.  Our mornings are all activity and\r\n  despatch, that our afternoons may be all mirth, and our evenings\r\n  repose.  I am afraid this will make you sigh with mingled envy and\r\n  sympathy; but whatever is that can be told, you may rely upon it that\r\n  I shall tell you, trusting to your feeling both pleasure and pain in\r\n  virtuous moderation.\r\n\r\n  "I have done my story; and now I am going to look what o\'clock it is--\r\n  a thing I have refrained from, in my impulse to tell you all.  The\r\n  house is quite still, and I heard the church clock strike something\r\n  very long just now; but I would not count.  It is so.  It was midnight\r\n  that the clock struck.  I shall seal this up directly.  I dare not\r\n  trust my morning--my broad daylight mood with it.  Now, as soon as you\r\n  have got thus far, just take up your pen, and answer me, telling me as\r\n  copiously of your affairs as I have written of ours.  Heaven bless\r\n  you.\r\n\r\n  "Yours ever,\r\n\r\n  "Edward Hope."\r\n\r\nIt was not only Mr Hope\'s broad daylight mood which was not to be\r\ntrusted with this letter.  In this hour of midnight a misgiving seized\r\nupon him that it was extravagant.  He became aware, when he laid down\r\nhis pen, that he was agitated.  The door of his room opened into the\r\ngarden.  He thought he would look out upon the night.  It was the night\r\nof the full moon.  As he stood in the doorway, the festoons of creepers\r\nthat dangled from his little porch waved in the night breeze; long\r\nshadows from the shrubs lay on the grass; and in the depth of one of\r\nthese shadows glimmered the green spark of a glow-worm.  It was\r\ndeliciously cool and serene.  Mr Hope stood leaning against the\r\ndoor-post, with his arms folded, and was not long in settling the\r\nquestion whether the letter should go.\r\n\r\n"Frank will think that I am in love," he considered.  "He will not\r\nunderstand the real state of my feeling.  He will think that I am in\r\nlove.  I should conclude so in his place.  But what matters it what he\r\ninfers and concludes?  I have written exactly what I thought and felt at\r\nthe moment, and it is not from such revelations that wrong inferences\r\nare usually drawn.  What I have written is true; and truth carries\r\nsafely over land and sea--more safely than confidence compounded with\r\ncaution.  Frank deserves the simplest and freshest confidence from me.\r\nI am glad that no hesitation occurred to me while I wrote.  It shall\r\ngo--every word of it."\r\n\r\nHe returned to his desk, sealed and addressed the letter, and placed it\r\nwhere it was sure to be seen in the morning, and carried to the\r\npost-office before he rose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER NINE.\r\n\r\nCHILD\'S PLAY.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon arrived when the children were to have their feast in the\r\nsummer-house.  From the hour of dinner the little people were as busy as\r\naldermen\'s cooks, spreading their table.  Sydney thought himself too old\r\nfor such play.  He was hard at work, filling up the pond he had dug in\r\nhis garden, having tried experiments with it for several weeks, and\r\nfound that it never held water but in a pouring rain.  While he was\r\noccupied with his spade, his sisters and the little Rowlands were\r\narranging their dishes, and brewing their cowslip-tea.\r\n\r\n"Our mamma is coming," said Fanny to Matilda: "is yours?"\r\n\r\n"No; she says she can\'t come--but papa will."\r\n\r\n"So will our papa.  It was so funny at dinner.  Mr Paxton came in, and\r\nasked whether papa would ride with him; and papa said it was out of the\r\nquestion; it must be to-morrow; for he had an engagement this\r\nafternoon."\r\n\r\n"A very particular engagement, he said," observed Mary: "and he smiled\r\nat me so, I could not help laughing.  Fanny, do look at Matilda\'s dish\r\nof strawberries!  How pretty!"\r\n\r\n"There\'s somebody coming," observed little Anna, who, being too young to\r\nhelp, and liable to be tempted to put her fingers into the good things,\r\nwas sent to amuse herself with jumping up and down the steps.\r\n\r\n"There now!  That is always the way, is not it, Miss Young?" cried\r\nFanny.  "Who is it, George?  Mr Enderby?  Oh, do not let him come in\r\nyet!  Tell him he must not come this half-hour."\r\n\r\nMr Enderby chose to enter, however, and all opposition gave way before\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"Pray don\'t send me back," said he, "till you know what I am come for.\r\nNow, who will pick my pockets?"\r\n\r\nLittle Anna was most on a level with the coat pocket.  She almost buried\r\nher face in it as she dived, the whole length of her arm, to the very\r\nbottom.  George attacked its fellow, while the waistcoat pockets were at\r\nthe mercy of the taller children.  A number of white parcels made their\r\nappearance, and the little girls screamed with delight.\r\n\r\n"Miss Young!" cried Fanny, "do come and help us to pick Mr Enderby\'s\r\npockets.  See what I have got--the very largest of all!"\r\n\r\nWhen every pocket had been thoroughly picked without Miss Young\'s\r\nassistance, the table did indeed show a goodly pile of white\r\ncornucopia,--that most agitating form of paper to children\'s eyes.  When\r\nopened, there was found such a store of sweet things as the little girls\r\nhad seldom before seen out of the confectioner\'s shop.  Difficulties are\r\napt to come with good fortune; and the anxious question was now asked,\r\nhow all these dainties were to be dished up.  Miss Young was, as usual,\r\nthe friend in need.  She had before lent two small china plates of her\r\nown; and she now supplied the further want.  She knew how to make pretty\r\nsquare boxes out of writing-paper; and her nimble scissors and neat\r\nfingers now provided a sufficiency of these in a trice.  Uncle Philip\r\nwas called upon, as each was finished, to admire her skill; and admire\r\nhe did, to the children\'s entire content.\r\n\r\n"Is this _our_ feast, Mr Enderby?" inquired Mary, finally, when Anna\r\nhad been sent to summon the company.  "May we say it is ours?"\r\n\r\n"To be sure," cried Fanny.  "Whose else should it be?"\r\n\r\n"It is all your own, I assure you," said Mr Enderby.  "Now, you two\r\nshould stand at the head of the table, and Matilda at the foot."\r\n\r\n"I think I had better take this place," said Sydney, who had made his\r\nappearance, and who thought much better of the affair now that he saw\r\nMr Enderby so much interested in it.  "There should always be a\r\ngentleman at the bottom of the table."\r\n\r\n"No, no, Sydney," protested Mr Enderby; "not when he has had no cost\r\nnor trouble about the feast.  March off.  You are only one of the\r\ncompany.  Stand there, Matilda, and remember you must look very polite.\r\nI shall hide behind the acacia there, and come in with the ladies."\r\n\r\nA sudden and pelting shower was now falling, however; and instead of\r\nhiding behind a tree, Mr Enderby had to run between the house and the\r\nschoolroom, holding umbrellas over the ladies\' heads, setting clogs for\r\nthem, and assuring Mrs Grey at each return that the feast could not be\r\ndeferred, and that nobody should catch cold.  Mr Grey was on the spot;\r\nto give his arm to Mrs Enderby, who had luckily chanced to look in,--a\r\nthing which "she really never did after dinner."  Mr Hope had been seen\r\nriding by, and Mrs Grey had sent after him to beg he would come in.\r\nMr Rowland made a point of being present: and thus the summer-house was\r\nquite full,--really crowded.\r\n\r\n"I am glad Mrs Rowland keeps away," whispered Mrs Grey to Sophia.\r\n"She would say it is insufferably hot."\r\n\r\n"Yes; that she would.  Do not you think we might have that window open?\r\nThe rain does not come in on that side.  Did you ever see such a feast\r\nas the children have got?  I am sure poor Elizabeth and I never managed\r\nsuch a one.  It is really a pity Mrs Rowland should not see it.  Mr\r\nRowland should have made her come.  It looks so odd, her being the only\r\none to stay away!"\r\n\r\nThe room resounded with exclamations, and admiration, and grave jokes\r\nupon the children.  Notwithstanding all Uncle Philip could do, the\r\ningenuous little girls answered to every compliment--that Mr Enderby\r\nbrought his, and that that and the other came out of Uncle Philip\'s\r\npocket.  They stood in their places, blushing and laughing, and served\r\nout their dainties with hands trembling with delight.\r\n\r\nMaria\'s pleasure was, as usual, in observing all that went on.\r\n\r\nShe could do this while replying, quite to the purpose, to Mrs\r\nEnderby\'s praise of her management of the dear children, and to George\'s\r\npressing offers of cake; and to Mr Rowland\'s suspicions that the\r\nchildren would never have accomplished this achievement without her, as\r\nindeed he might say of all their achievements; and to Anna\'s entreaty\r\nthat she would eat a pink comfit, and then a yellow one, and then a\r\ngreen one; and to Mrs Grey\'s wonder where she could have put away all\r\nher books and things, to make so much room for the children.  She could\r\nsee Mr Hope\'s look of delight when Margaret declined a cup of\r\nchocolate, and said she preferred tasting some of the cowslip-tea.  She\r\nsaw how he helped Mary to pour out the tea, and how quietly he took the\r\nopportunity of getting rid of it through the window behind Margaret,\r\nwhen she could not pretend to say that she liked it.  She observed Mr\r\nRowland\'s somewhat stiff politeness to Hester, and Mr Enderby\'s equal\r\npartition of his attentions between the two sisters.  She could see Mrs\r\nGrey watching every strawberry and sugar-plum that went down the throats\r\nof the little Rowlands, and her care, seconded by Sophia\'s, that her own\r\nchildren should have an exactly equal portion of the good things.  She\r\nbelieved, but was not quite sure, that she saw Hester\'s colour and\r\nmanner change as Mr Hope came and went, in the course of his service\r\nabout the table; and that once, upon receiving some slight attention\r\nfrom him, she threw a hasty glance towards her sister, and turned quite\r\naway upon meeting her eye.\r\n\r\nThe rain had not prevented the servants from trying to amuse themselves\r\nwith witnessing the amusement of the family.  They were clustered\r\ntogether under umbrellas at the window nearest the stables, where they\r\nthought they should be least observed.  Some commotion took place among\r\nthem, at the same moment that an extraordinary sound became audible,\r\nfrom a distance, above the clatter of plates, and the mingling of\r\nvoices, in the summer-house.\r\n\r\n"What in the world is that noise?" asked Margaret.\r\n\r\n"Only somebody killing a pig," replied Sydney, decidedly.\r\n\r\n"Do not believe him," said Mr Enderby.  "The Deerbrook people have\r\nbetter manners than to kill their pigs in the hearing of ladies on\r\nsummer afternoons."\r\n\r\n"But what is it?  It seems coming nearer."\r\n\r\n"I once told you," said Mr Enderby, "that we possess an inhabitant,\r\nwhose voice you might know before her name.  I suspect it is that same\r\nvoice which we hear now."\r\n\r\n"A human voice!  Impossible!"\r\n\r\n"What is the matter, Alice?"  Mrs Grey asked of her maid out of the\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\n"Oh, ma\'am, it is Mrs Plumstead!  And she is coming this way, ma\'am.\r\nShe will be upon us before we can get to the house.  Oh, ma\'am, what\r\nshall we do?"\r\n\r\nMrs Grey entreated permission of the ladies to allow the maid-servants\r\nto come into the summer-house.  Their caps might be torn from their\r\nheads before they could defend themselves, she said, if they remained\r\noutside.  Of course, leave was given instantly, and the maids crowded\r\nin, with chattering teeth and many a tale of deeds done by Mrs\r\nPlumstead, in her paroxysms of rage.\r\n\r\nThe children shared the panic, more or less: and not only they.  Mr\r\nGrey proposed to put up the shutters of the windows nearest to the scene\r\nof action; but it was thought that this might draw on an attack from the\r\nvirago, who might let the party alone if she were left unnoticed by\r\nthem.  She was now full in sight, as, with half Deerbrook at her heels,\r\nshe pursued the object of her rage through the falling shower, and\r\namidst the puddles in front of the stables.  Her widow\'s cap was at the\r\nback of her head, her hair hanging from beneath it, wet in the rain: her\r\nblack gown was splashed to the shoulders; her hands were clenched; her\r\nface was white as her apron, and her vociferations were dreadful to\r\nhear.  She was hunting a poor terrified young countrywoman, who, between\r\nfright and running, looked ready to sink.\r\n\r\n"We must put a stop to this," cried Mr Grey and Mr Rowland, each\r\nspeaking to the other.  It ended with their issuing forth together,\r\nlooking as dignified as they could, and placing themselves between the\r\nscold and her victim.  It would not do.  They could not make themselves\r\nheard; and when she shook her fist in their faces, they retired\r\nbackwards, and took refuge among their party, bringing the victim in\r\nwith them, however.  Mr Enderby declared this retreat too bad, and was\r\ngone before the entreaties of his little nieces could stop him.  He held\r\nhis ground longer; and the dumb show he made was so energetic as to\r\ncause a laugh in the summer-house, in the midst of the uneasiness of his\r\nfriends, and to call forth shouts of mirth from the crowd at the\r\nvirago\'s heels.\r\n\r\n"That will not do.  It will only exasperate her the more," said Mr\r\nHope, pressing his way to the door.  "Let me pass, will you?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr Hope!  Oh, sir!" said Alice, "don\'t go!  Don\'t think of going,\r\nsir!  She does not mind killing anybody, I assure you, sir."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr Hope, don\'t go!" cried almost everybody.  Maria was sure she\r\nheard Hester\'s voice among the rest.  The young countrywoman and the\r\nchildren grasped the skirts of his coat; but he shook them off,\r\nlaughing, and went.  Little Mary loved Mr Hope very dearly.  She shot\r\nout at the door with him, and clasped her hands before Mrs Plumstead,\r\nlooking up piteously, as if to implore her to do Mr Hope no harm.\r\nAlready, however, the vixen\'s mood had changed.  At the first glimpse of\r\nMr Hope, her voice sank from being a squall into some resemblance to\r\nhuman utterance.  She pulled her cap forward, and a tinge of colour\r\nreturned to her white lips.  Mr Enderby caught up little Mary and\r\ncarried her to her mamma, crying bitterly.  Mr Hope might safely be\r\nleft to finish his conquest of the otherwise unconquerable scold.  He\r\nstood still till he could make himself heard, looking her full in the\r\nface; and it was not long before she would listen to his remonstrance,\r\nand even at length take his advice, to go home and compose herself.  He\r\nwent with her, to ensure the good behaviour of her neighbours, and had\r\nthe satisfaction of seeing her lock herself into her house alone before\r\nhe returned to his party.\r\n\r\n"It is as you told me," said Margaret to Mr Enderby; "Mr Hope\'s power\r\nextends even to the temper of the Deerbrook scold.  How she began to\r\ngrow quiet directly!  It was like magic."\r\n\r\nMr Enderby smiled; but there was some uneasiness in his smile.\r\n\r\nThe countrywoman was commended to the servants, to be refreshed, and\r\ndismissed another way.  There was no further reason for detaining her\r\nwhen it appeared that she really could give no account of how she had\r\noffended Mrs Plumstead in selling her a pound of butter.  It remained\r\nto console little Mary, who was still crying,--more from grief for Mrs\r\nPlumstead than from fear, Maria thought, though Mrs Grey was profuse in\r\nassurances to the child that Mrs Plumstead should not be allowed to\r\nfrighten her any more.  All the children seemed so depressed and\r\nconfounded, that their guests exerted themselves to be merry again, and\r\nto efface, as far as was possible, the impression of the late scene.\r\nWhen Mr Hope returned, he found Mr Grey singing his single ditty,\r\nabout Dame Dumshire and her crockery-ware, amidst great mirth and\r\nunbounded applause.  Then Mrs Enderby was fluttered, and somewhat\r\nflattered, by an entreaty that she would favour the company with one of\r\nthe ballads, for which she had been famous in her time.  She could not\r\nrefuse on such an occasion,--if indeed she had ever been able to refuse\r\nwhat she was told would give pleasure.  She made her son choose for her\r\nwhat she should sing; and then followed a wonderful story of Giles\r\nCollins, who loved a lady: Giles and the lady both died of true love;\r\nGiles was laid in the lower chancel, and the lady in the higher; from\r\nthe one grave grew a milk-white rose, and from the other a briar, both\r\nof which climbed up to the church top, and there tied themselves into a\r\ntrue-lover\'s knot, which made all the parish admire.  At this part, Anna\r\nwas seen looking up at the ceiling; but the rest had no eyes but for\r\nMrs Enderby, as she gazed full at the opposite wall, and the shrill,\r\nquavering notes of the monotonous air were poured out, and the words\r\nwere as distinct as if they were spoken.\r\n\r\n"Is that true, grandmamma?" asked Anna, when all was over.\r\n\r\n"You had better ask the person who made the song, my dear.  I did not\r\nmake it."\r\n\r\n"But did you ever see that church with the briar growing in it, before\r\nthe sexton cut it down?"\r\n\r\n"Do not let us talk any more about it," said Philip, solemnly.  "I\r\nwonder grandmamma dares sing such a sad song."\r\n\r\n"Why, you asked her, Uncle Philip."\r\n\r\n"Oh, ay, so I did.  Well, we are much obliged to her; and now we will\r\nhave something that is not quite so terrible.--Miss Grey, you will\r\nfavour us with a song?"\r\n\r\nSophia\'s music-books were all in the house, and she could not sing\r\nwithout.  Mr Enderby would fetch some, if she would give him directions\r\nwhat to bring.  No; she could not sing without the piano.  As it was\r\nclearly impossible to bring that, Philip feared the company must wait\r\nfor the pleasure of hearing Miss Grey till another time.  Mr Grey would\r\nhave Hester and Margaret sing; and sing they did, very simply and\r\nsweetly, and much to the satisfaction of all present.  One thing led on\r\nto another; they sang together,--with Mr Grey,--with Mr Enderby; Mr\r\nHope listening with an unlearned eagerness, which made Mrs Grey wink at\r\nher husband, and nod at Sophia, and exchange smiles with Mrs Enderby.\r\nThey proceeded to catches at last; and when people really fond of music\r\nget to singing catches in a summer-house, who can foresee the end?\r\n\r\n"`Fair Enslaver!\'" cried Mr Enderby.  "You must know `Fair Enslaver:\'\r\nthere is not a sweeter catch than that.  Come, Miss Ibbotson, begin;\r\nyour sister will follow, and I--"\r\n\r\nBut it so happened that Miss Ibbotson had never heard `Fair Enslaver.\'\r\nMargaret knew it, she believed; but she did not.  With a gay eagerness,\r\nMr Enderby turned round to Maria, saying that he knew she could sing\r\nthis catch; and everybody was aware that when she had the power of doing\r\na kindness, she never wanted the will;--he remembered that she could\r\nsing `Fair Enslaver.\'  He might well remember this, for often had they\r\nsung it together.  While several of the company were saying they did not\r\nknow Miss Young could sing, and the children were explaining that she\r\noften sang at her work, Mr Enderby observed some signs of agitation in\r\nMaria, and hastened to say,--"You had rather not, perhaps.  Pray do not\r\nthink of it.  I will find something else in a moment.  I beg your\r\npardon: I was very inconsiderate."\r\n\r\nBut Maria thought she had rather not accept the consideration; and\r\nbesides, the children were anxious that she should sing.  She bore her\r\npart in a way which made Mr Rowland and Mrs Grey agree that she was a\r\nvery superior young woman indeed; that they were singularly fortunate to\r\nhave secured her for their children; and that she was much to be pitied.\r\n\r\n"I think Miss Young has got a little cold, though," observed Sydney.\r\n"Her voice is not in the least husky when she sits singing here by\r\nherself.--Father! look there! there are all the servants huddled\r\ntogether under the window again, to listen to the singing."\r\n\r\nThis was true; and the rain was over.  It was presently settled that the\r\nschoolroom should be evacuated by the present party; that the children\r\nshould be allowed to invite the servants in, to dispense to them the\r\nremains of the feast; and that Miss Young must favour Mrs Grey with her\r\ncompany this evening.\r\n\r\nMr Rowland was obliged to return home to business; but, before his\r\nfriends dispersed, he must just say that Mrs Rowland and he had never,\r\nfor a moment, given up the hope of the pleasure of entertaining them at\r\ndinner in the Dingleford woods; and, as the rains were now daily\r\nabating, he might perhaps be allowed to name Wednesday of the next week\r\nas the day of the excursion.  He hoped to see the whole of the present\r\ncompany, from the oldest to the youngest,--bowing, as he spoke, to Mrs\r\nEnderby and to his own little daughter Anna.  This was one of Mr\r\nRowland\'s pieces of independent action.  His lady had given him no\r\ncommission to bring the affair to an issue; and he returned home,\r\ninvoluntarily planning what kind of an unconcerned face and manner he\r\nshould put on, while he told her what he had done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TEN.\r\n\r\nA PARTY OF PLEASURE.\r\n\r\nMr Rowland hoped "to see the whole of the present company, from the\r\noldest to the youngest."  This was the best part of his speech to the\r\nears of the children; it made an impression also upon some others.  Two\r\nor three days afterwards, Sydney burst, laughing, into the dining-room,\r\nwhere his mother and her guests were at work, to tell them that he had\r\nseen Mr Hope riding a pony in the oddest way, in the lane behind his\r\nlodgings.  He had a side-saddle, and a horse-cloth put on like a lady\'s\r\nriding-habit.  He rode the pony in and out among the trees, and made it\r\nscramble up the hill behind, and it went as nicely as could be, wherever\r\nhe wanted it to go.  Mr Hope\'s new way of riding was easily explained,\r\nthe next time he called.  Miss Young was certainly included in the\r\ninvitation to Dingleford woods: it was a pity she should not go; and she\r\ncould not walk in wild places:--the pony was training for her.  Mrs\r\nGrey quite agreed that Miss Young ought to go, but thought that Mr Hope\r\nwas giving himself much needless trouble; there would be room made for\r\nher in some carriage, of course.  No doubt; but no kind of carriage\r\ncould make its way in the woods; and, but for this pony, Miss Young\r\nwould have to sit in a carriage, or under a tree, the whole time that\r\nthe rest of the party were rambling about; whereas, this quiet active\r\nlittle pony would take care that she was nowhere left behind.  It could\r\ndo everything but climb trees.  It was to be taken over to Dingleford\r\nthe evening before, and would be waiting for its rider on the verge of\r\nthe woods, when the party should arrive.\r\n\r\nMiss Young was touched, and extremely pleased with Mr Hope\'s attention.\r\nIn the days of her prosperity she had been accustomed to ride much, and\r\nwas very fond of it; but since her misfortunes she had never once been\r\nin the saddle--lame as she was, and debarred from other exercise.  To be\r\non a horse again, and among the woods, was a delicious prospect; and\r\nwhen a few misgivings had been reasoned away--misgivings about being\r\ntroublesome, about being in the way of somebody\'s pleasure or\r\nconvenience--Maria resigned herself to the full expectation of a most\r\ndelightful day, if the weather would only be fine.  The children would\r\nbe there; and they were always willing to do anything for her.  Sydney\r\nwould guide her pony in case of need, or show her where she might stay\r\nbehind by herself, if the others should exhibit a passion for\r\nimpracticable places.  She knew that Margaret would enjoy the day all\r\nthe more for her being there; and so would Mr Hope, as he had amply\r\nproved.  Maria was really delighted to be going, and she and the\r\nchildren rejoiced together.\r\n\r\nThis great pleasure involved some minor enjoyments too, in the way of\r\npreparation.  On Sunday Mr Hope told her, that he believed the pony was\r\nnow fully trained; but he should like that she should try it, especially\r\nas she had been long out of the habit of riding.  She must take a ride\r\nwith him on Monday and Tuesday afternoons, for practice.  The Monday\'s\r\nride was charming; through Verdon woods, and home over the heath from\r\nCrossley End.  The circuit, which was to have been three miles, had\r\nextended to ten.  She must be moderate, she said to herself, the next\r\nday, and not let Mr Hope spend so much of his time upon her; and\r\nbesides, the pony had to be sent over to Dingleford in the evening,\r\nafter she had done with it, to be in readiness for her on Wednesday\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nThe ride on Tuesday was happily accomplished, as that of Monday: but it\r\nwas much shorter.  Mr Hope agreed that it should be short, as he had a\r\npatient to visit on the Dingleford road, so near the hamlet that he\r\nmight as well take the pony there himself.  It would trot along beside\r\nhis horse.  Sydney saved him part of the charge.  Sydney would at all\r\ntimes walk back any distance for the sake of a ride out, on whatever\r\nkind of saddle, or almost any kind of quadruped.  He was in waiting at\r\nthe farrier\'s gate, when Miss Young returned from her ride; and having\r\nassisted her into the house, he threw himself upon her pony, and rode\r\nthree miles and a half on the Dingleford road before he would dismount,\r\nand deliver his bridle into Mr Hope\'s hand.  Tea was over, and the\r\ntea-things removed, before he appeared at home, heated and delighted\r\nwith his expedition.  He ran to the dairy for a basin of milk, and\r\ndeclared that his being hot and tired did not matter in the least, as he\r\nhad no lessons to do--the next day being a holiday.\r\n\r\nIt was about two hours after this, when Hester and Margaret were singing\r\nto Sophia\'s playing, that Mr Grey put his head in at the door, and\r\nbeckoned Mrs Grey out of the room.  She remained absent a considerable\r\ntime; and when she returned, the singers were in the middle of another\r\nduet.  She wandered restlessly about the room till the piece was\r\nfinished, and then made a sign to Sophia to follow her into the\r\nstoreroom, the double door of which the sisters could hear carefully\r\nclosed.  They were too much accustomed to the appearance of mystery\r\namong the ladies of the Grey family, to be surprised at any number of\r\nsecret conferences which might take place in the course of the day.  But\r\nevening was not the usual time for these.  The family practice was to\r\ntransact all private consultations in the morning, and to assemble round\r\nthe work-table or piano after tea.  The sisters made no remark to each\r\nother on the present occasion, but continued their singing, each\r\nsupposing that the store-room conference related to some preparation for\r\nthe next day\'s excursion.\r\n\r\nIt was too dark to distinguish anything in the room before their hostess\r\nre-entered it.  Margaret was playing quadrilles; Hester was standing at\r\nthe window, watching the shadows which the risen moon was flinging\r\nacross the field, and the lighting up of Mrs Enderby\'s parlour behind\r\nthe blinds; and Sydney was teasing his twin sisters with rough play on\r\nthe sofa, when Mrs Grey returned.\r\n\r\n"You are all in the dark," said she, in a particularly grave tone.\r\n"Why, did you not ring for lights, my dears?" and she rang immediately.\r\n"Be quiet, children!  I will not have you make so much noise."\r\n\r\nThe little girls seemed to wish to obey; but their brother still forced\r\nthem to giggle; and their struggling entreaties were heard--"Now don\'t,\r\nSydney; now pray, Sydney, don\'t!"\r\n\r\n"Mary and Fanny, go to bed," said their mother, decidedly, when lights\r\nwere brought.  "Sydney, bid your cousins good-night, and then come with\r\nme; I want to ask you a question."\r\n\r\n"Good-night already, mother!  Why, it is not time yet this half-hour."\r\n\r\n"It is enough that I choose you to go to bed.  Wish your cousins\r\ngood-night, and come with me."\r\n\r\nMrs Grey led the way once more into the store-room, followed, rather\r\nsulkily, by Sydney.\r\n\r\n"What can all this be about?" whispered Hester to Margaret.  "There is\r\nalways something going on which we are not to know."\r\n\r\n"Some affair of fruit, or wine, or bonbons, perhaps, which are all the\r\nbetter for making their appearance unexpectedly."\r\n\r\nAt this moment Sophia and her mother entered by opposite doors.\r\nSophia\'s eyes were red; and there was every promise in her face that the\r\nslightest word spoken to her would again open the sluices of her tears.\r\nMrs Grey\'s countenance was to the last degree dismal: but she talked--\r\ntalked industriously, of everything she could think of.  This was the\r\nbroadest possible hint to the sisters not to inquire what was the\r\nmatter; and they therefore went on sewing and conversing very diligently\r\ntill they thought they might relieve Mrs Grey by offering to retire.\r\nThey hesitated only because Mr Grey had not come in; and he so\r\nregularly appeared at ten o\'clock, that they had never yet retired\r\nwithout having enjoyed half an hour\'s chat with him.\r\n\r\n"Sophia, my dear," said her mother, "are the night candles there?  Light\r\nyour cousins\' candles.--I am sure they are wishing to go; and it is\r\ngetting late.  You will not see Mr Grey to-night, my dears.  He has\r\nbeen sent for to a distance."\r\n\r\nAt this moment, the scrambling of a horse\'s feet was heard on the gravel\r\nbefore the front door.  Sophia looked at her mother, and each lighted a\r\ncandle precipitately, and thrust it into a hand of each cousin.\r\n\r\n"There, go, my dears," said Mrs Grey.  "Never mind stopping for Mr\r\nGrey.  I will deliver your good-night to him.  You will have to be\r\nrather early in the morning, you know.  Good-night, good-night."\r\n\r\nThus Hester and Margaret were hurried up-stairs, while the front door\r\nwas in the act of being unbarred for Mr Grey\'s entrance.  Morris was\r\ndespatched after them, with equal speed, by Mrs Grey\'s orders, and she\r\nreached their chamber-door at the same moment that they did.\r\n\r\nHester set down her candle, bade Morris shut the door, and threw herself\r\ninto an armchair with wonderful decision of manner, declaring that she\r\nhad never been so treated;--to be amused and sent to bed like a baby, in\r\na house where she was a guest!\r\n\r\n"I am afraid something is the matter," said Margaret.\r\n\r\n"What then? they might have told us so, and said plainly that they had\r\nrather be alone."\r\n\r\n"People must choose their own ways of managing their own affairs, you\r\nknow: and what those ways are cannot matter to us, as long as we are not\r\noffended at them."\r\n\r\n"Do you take your own way of viewing their behaviour, then, and leave me\r\nmine," said Hester hastily.\r\n\r\nMorris feared there was something amiss; and she believed Alice knew\r\nwhat it was: but she had not told either cook or housemaid a syllable\r\nabout it.  By Morris\'s account, Alice had been playing the mysterious in\r\nthe kitchen as her mistress had in the parlour.  Mr Grey had been\r\nsuddenly sent for, and had saddled his horse himself, as his people were\r\nall gone, and there was no one on the premises to do it for him.  A\r\nwine-glass had also been called for, for Miss Sophia, whose weeping had\r\nbeen overheard.  Master Sydney had gone to his room very cross,\r\ncomplaining of his mother\'s having questioned him overmuch about his\r\nride, and then sent him to bed half an hour before his usual time.\r\n\r\nA deadly fear seized upon Margaret\'s heart, when she heard of Sydney\'s\r\ncomplaint of being overmuch questioned about his ride,--a deadly fear\r\nfor Hester.  If her suspicion should prove true, it was out of pure\r\nconsideration that they had been "amused and sent to bed like babies."\r\nA glance at Hester showed that the same apprehension had crossed her\r\nmind.  Her eyes were closed for a moment, and her face was white as\r\nashes.  It was not for long, however.  She presently said, with\r\ndecision, that whatever was the matter, it must be some entirely private\r\naffair of the Greys\'.  If any accident had happened to any one in the\r\nvillage,--if bad news had arrived of any common friend,--there would be\r\nno occasion for secrecy.  In such a case, Mrs Grey would have given\r\nherself the comfort of speaking of it to her guests.  It must certainly\r\nbe some entirely private, some family affair.--Hester was sincere in\r\nwhat she said.  She knew so little of the state of her own heart, that\r\nshe could not conceive how some things in it could be divined or\r\nspeculated upon by others.  Still only on the brink of the discovery\r\nthat she loved Mr Hope, she could never have imagined that any one else\r\ncould dream of such a thing,--much less act upon it.  She was angry with\r\nherself for letting her fears now point for a moment to Mr Hope; for,\r\nif this bad news had related to him, her sister and she would, of\r\ncourse, have heard of it the next moment after the Greys.  Margaret\r\ncaught her sister\'s meaning, and strove to the utmost to think as she\r\ndid; but Sydney\'s complaint of being "overmuch questioned about his\r\nride" was fatal to the attempt.  It returned upon her incessantly during\r\nthe night; and when, towards morning, she slept a little, these words\r\nseemed to be sounding in her ear all the while.  Before undressing, both\r\nshe and Hester had been unable to resist stepping out upon the stairs to\r\nwatch for signs whether it was the intention of the family to sit up or\r\ngo to rest.  All had retired to their rooms some time before midnight;\r\nand then it was certain that nothing more could be learned before\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nEach sister believed that the other slept; but neither could be sure.\r\nIt was an utterly wretched night to both, and the first which they had\r\never passed in misery, without speaking to each other.  Margaret\'s\r\nsuffering was all from apprehension.  Hester was little alarmed in\r\ncomparison; but she this night underwent the discovery which her sister\r\nhad made some little time ago.  She discovered that nothing could happen\r\nto her so dreadful as any evil befalling Mr Hope.  She discovered that\r\nhe was more to her than the sister whom she could have declared, but a\r\nfew hours before, to be the dearest on earth to her.  She discovered\r\nthat she was for ever humbled in her own eyes; that her self-respect had\r\nreceived an incurable wound: for Mr Hope had never given her reason to\r\nregard him as more than a friend.  During the weary hours of this night,\r\nshe revolved every conversation, every act of intercourse, which she\r\ncould recall; and from all that she could remember, the same impression\r\nresulted--that Mr Hope was a friend, a kind and sympathising friend--\r\ninterested in her views and opinions, in her tastes and feelings;--that\r\nhe was this kind friend, and nothing more.  He had in no case\r\ndistinguished her from her sister.  She had even thought, at times, that\r\nMargaret had been the more important of the two to him.  That might be\r\nfrom her own jealous temper, which, she knew, was apt to make her fancy\r\nevery one preferred to herself: but she _had_ thought that he liked\r\nMargaret best, as she was sure Mr Enderby did.  Whichever way she\r\nlooked at the case, it was all wretchedness.  She had lost her\r\nself-sufficiency and self-respect, and she was miserable.\r\n\r\nThe first rays of morning have a wonderful power of putting to flight\r\nthe terrors of the darkness, whether their causes lie without us or\r\nwithin.  When the first beam of the midsummer sunshine darted into the\r\nchamber, through the leafy limes which shaded one side of the apartment,\r\nHester\'s mood transiently changed.  There was a brief reaction in her\r\nspirits.  She thought she had been making herself miserable far too\r\nreadily.  The mystery of the preceding evening might turn out a trifle:\r\nshe had been thinking too seriously about her own fancies.  If she had\r\nreally been discovering a great and sad secret about herself, no one\r\nelse knew it, nor need ever know it.  She could command herself; and, in\r\nthe strength of pride and duty, she would do so.  All was not lost.\r\nBefore this mood had passed away, she fell asleep, with prayer in her\r\nheart, and quiet tears upon her cheek.  Both sisters were roused from\r\ntheir brief slumbers by a loud tapping at their door.  All in readiness\r\nto be alarmed, Margaret sprang up, and was at the door to know who was\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n"It is us--it is we, Fanny and Mary, cousin Margaret," answered the\r\ntwins, "come to call you.  It is such a fine morning, you can\'t think.\r\nPapa does not believe we shall have a drop of rain to-day.  The baker\'s\r\nboy has just carried the rolls,--such a basket-full!--to Mrs Rowland\'s:\r\nso you must get up.  Mamma is getting up already."\r\n\r\nThe sisters were vexed to have been thrown into a terror for nothing;\r\nbut it was a great relief to find Mr Grey prophesying fine weather for\r\nthe excursion.  Nothing could have happened to cast a doubt over it.\r\nMargaret, too, now began to think that the mystery might turn out a\r\ntrifle; and she threw up the sash, to let in the fresh air, with a\r\ngaiety of spirits she had little expected to feel.\r\n\r\nAnother tap at the door.  It was Morris, with the news that it was a\r\nfine morning, that the whole house was astir, and that she had no\r\nfurther news to tell.\r\n\r\nAnother tap before they were half-dressed.  It was Mrs Grey, with a\r\nface quite as sorrowful as on the preceding evening, and the peculiar\r\nnervous expression about the mouth--which served her instead of tears.\r\n\r\n"Have you done with Morris yet, my dears?"\r\n\r\n"Morris, you may go," said Hester, steadily.\r\n\r\nMrs Grey gazed at her with a mournful inquisitiveness, while she spoke;\r\nand kept her eyes fixed on Hester throughout, though what she said\r\nseemed addressed to both sisters.\r\n\r\n"There is something the matter, Mrs Grey," continued Hester, calmly.\r\n"Say what it is.  You had better have told us last night."\r\n\r\n"I thought it best not to break your sleep, my dears.  We always think\r\nbad news is best told in the morning."\r\n\r\n"Tell us," said Margaret.  Hester quietly seated herself on the bed.\r\n\r\n"It concerns our valued friend, Mr Hope," said Mrs Grey.  Hester\'s\r\ncolour had been going from the moment Mrs Grey entered the room: it was\r\nnow quite gone; but she preserved her calmness.\r\n\r\n"He was safe when Sydney lost sight of him, on the ridge of the hill, on\r\nthe Dingleford road; but he afterwards had an accident."\r\n\r\n"What kind of accident?" inquired Margaret.\r\n\r\n"Is he killed?" asked Hester.\r\n\r\n"No, not killed.  He was found insensible in the road.  The miller\'s boy\r\nobserved his horse, without a rider, plunge into the river below the\r\ndam, and swim across; and another person saw the pony Sydney had been\r\nriding, grazing with a side-saddle on, on the common.  This made them\r\nsearch, and they found Mr Hope lying in the road insensible, as I told\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"What is thought of his state?" asked Margaret.\r\n\r\n"Two medical men were called immediately from the nearest places, and\r\nMr Grey saw them last night; for the news reached us while you were at\r\nthe piano, and we thought--"\r\n\r\n"Yes but what do the medical men say?"\r\n\r\n"They do not speak very favourably.  It is a concussion of the brain.\r\nThey declare the case is not hopeless, and that is all they can say.  He\r\nhas not spoken yet; only just opened his eyes: but we are assured the\r\ncase is not quite desperate; so we must hope for the best."\r\n\r\n"I am glad the case is not desperate," said Hester.  "He would be a\r\ngreat loss to you all."\r\n\r\nMrs Grey looked at her in amazement, and then at Margaret.  Margaret\'s\r\neyes were full of tears.  She comprehended and respected the effort her\r\nsister was making.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mrs Grey!" said Margaret, "must we go to-day?  Surely it is no\r\ntime for an excursion of pleasure."\r\n\r\n"That must be as you feel disposed, my dears.  It would annoy Mrs\r\nRowland very much to have the party broken up; so much so, that some of\r\nus must go: but my young people will do their best to fill your places,\r\nif you feel yourselves unequal to the exertion."  She looked at Hester\r\nas she spoke.\r\n\r\n"Oh, if anybody goes, we go, of course," said Hester.  "I think you are\r\nquite right in supposing that the business of the day must proceed.  If\r\nthere was anything to be done by staying at home,--if you could make us\r\nof any use, Mrs Grey, it would be a different thing: but--"\r\n\r\n"Well, if there is nothing in your feelings which--if you believe\r\nyourselves equal to the exertion--"\r\n\r\nMargaret now interposed.  "One had rather stay at home and be quiet,\r\nwhen one is anxious about one\'s friends: but other people must be\r\nconsidered, as we seem to be agreed,--Mr and Mrs Rowland, and all the\r\nchildren.  So we will proceed with our dressing, Mrs Grey.  But can you\r\ntell us, before you go, how soon--How soon we shall know;--when this\r\ncase will probably be decided?"\r\n\r\nIt might be a few hours, or it might be many days, Mrs Grey said.  She\r\nshould stay at home to-day, in case of anything being sent for from the\r\nfarmhouse where Mr Hope was lying.  He was well attended--in the hands\r\nof good nurses--former patients of his own: but something might be\r\nwanted; and orders had been left by Mr Grey that application should be\r\nmade to his house for whatever could be of service: so Mrs Grey could\r\nnot think of leaving home.  Mr Grey would make inquiry at the farmhouse\r\nas the party went by to the woods: and he would just turn his horse back\r\nin the middle of the day, to inquire again: and thus the Rowlands\' party\r\nwould know more of Mr Hope\'s state than those who remained at home.\r\nHaving explained, Mrs Grey quitted the room, somewhat disappointed that\r\nHester had received the disclosure so well.\r\n\r\nThe moment the door was closed, Hester sank forward on the bed, her face\r\nhidden, but her trembling betraying her emotion.\r\n\r\n"I feared this," said Margaret, looking mournfully at her sister.\r\n\r\n"You feared what?" asked Hester, quickly, looking up.\r\n\r\n"I feared that some accident had happened to Mr Hope."\r\n\r\n"So did I."\r\n\r\n"And if," said Margaret, "I feared something else--Nay, Hester, you must\r\nlet me speak.  We must have no concealments, Hester.  You and I are\r\nalone in the world, and we must comfort each other.  We agreed to this.\r\nWhy should you be ashamed of what you feel?  I believe that you have a\r\nstronger interest in this misfortune than any one in the world; and\r\nwhy--"\r\n\r\n"How do you mean, a stronger interest?" asked Hester, trying to command\r\nher voice.  "Tell me what you mean, Margaret."\r\n\r\n"I mean," said Margaret, steadily, "that no one is so much attached to\r\nMr Hope as you are."\r\n\r\n"I think," said Margaret, after a pause, "that Mr Hope has a high\r\nrespect and strong regard for you."  She paused again, and then added,\r\n"If I believed anything more, I would tell you."\r\n\r\nWhen Hester could speak again, she said, gently and humbly, "I assure\r\nyou, Margaret, I never knew the state of my own mind till this last\r\nnight.  If I had been aware--"\r\n\r\n"If you had been aware, you would have been unlike all who ever really\r\nloved, if people say true.  Now that you have become aware, you will act\r\nas you _can_ act--nobly--righteously.  You will struggle with your\r\nfeelings till your mind grows calm.  Peace will come in time."\r\n\r\n"Do you think there is no hope?"\r\n\r\n"Consider his state."\r\n\r\n"But if he should recover?  Oh, Margaret, how wicked all this is!  While\r\nhe lies there, we are grieving about me!  What a selfish wretch I am!"\r\n\r\nMargaret had nothing to reply, there seemed so much truth in this.  Even\r\nshe reproached herself with being exclusively anxious about her sister,\r\nwhen such a friend might be dying; when a life of such importance to\r\nmany was in jeopardy.\r\n\r\n"I could do anything, I could bear anything," said Hester, "if I could\r\nbe sure that nobody knew.  But you found me out, Margaret, and\r\nperhaps--"\r\n\r\n"I assure you, I believe you are safe," said Margaret.  "You can hide\r\nnothing from me.  But, Mrs Grey--and nobody except myself, has watched\r\nyou like Mrs Grey--has gone away, I am certain, completely deceived.\r\nBut, Hester! my own precious sister, bear with one word from me!  Do not\r\ntrust too much to your pride."\r\n\r\n"I do trust to _my_ pride, and I will," replied Hester, her cheeks in a\r\nglow.  "Do you suppose I will allow all in this house, all in the\r\nvillage, to be pitying me, to be watching how I suffer, when no one\r\nsupposes that he gave me cause?  It is not to be endured, even in the\r\nbare thought.  No.  If you do not betray me--"\r\n\r\n"I betray you?"\r\n\r\n"Well, well!  I know you will not: and then I am safe.  _My_ pride I can\r\ntrust to, and I will."\r\n\r\n"It will betray you," sighed Margaret.  "I do not want you to parade\r\nyour sorrow, God knows!  It will be better borne in quiet and secrecy.\r\nWhat I wish for you is, that you should receive this otherwise than as a\r\npunishment, a disgrace in your own eyes for something wrong.  You have\r\ndone nothing wrong, nothing that you may not appeal to God to help you\r\nto endure.  Take it as a sorrow sent by Him, to be meekly borne, as what\r\nno earthly person has any concern with.  Be superior to the opinions of\r\nthe people about us, instead of defying them.  Pride will give you no\r\npeace: resignation will."\r\n\r\n"I am too selfish for this," sighed Hester.  "I hate myself, Margaret.\r\nI have not even the grace to love _him_, except for my own sake; and\r\nwhile he is dying, I am planning to save my pride!  I do not care what\r\nbecomes of me.  Come, Margaret, let us dress and go down.  Do not\r\ntrouble your kind heart about me: I am not worth it."\r\n\r\nThis mood gave way a little to Margaret\'s grief and endearments; but\r\nHester issued from her chamber for the day in a state of towering pride,\r\nsecretly alternating with the anguish of self-contempt.\r\n\r\nIt was a miserable day, as wretched a party of pleasure as could be\r\nimagined.  Mrs Rowland was occupied in thinking, and occasionally\r\nsaying, how strangely everything fell out to torment her, how something\r\nalways occurred to cross every plan of hers.  She talked about this to\r\nher mother, Sophia, and Hester, who were in the barouche with her, till\r\nthe whole cavalcade stopped, just before reaching the farmhouse where\r\nMr Hope lay, and to which Mr Grey rode on to make inquiries.  Margaret\r\nwas with Mr Rowland in his gig.  It was a breathless three minutes till\r\nMr Grey brought the news.  Margaret wondered how Hester was bearing it:\r\nit would have pleased her to have known that Mrs Rowland was holding\r\nforth so strenuously upon her disappointment about a dress at the last\r\nBuckley ball, and about her children having had the measles on the only\r\noccasion when Mr Rowland could have taken her to the races in the next\r\ncounty, that Hester might sit in silence, and bear the suspense\r\nunobserved.  Mr Grey reappeared, quite as soon as he could be looked\r\nfor.  There might have been worse news.  Mr Hope was no longer in a\r\nstupor: he was delirious.  His medical attendants could not pronounce\r\nany judgment upon the case further than that it was not hopeless.  They\r\nhad known recovery in similar cases.  As Mr Grey bore his report from\r\ncarriage to carriage, every one strove to speak cheerfully, and to make\r\nthe best of the case; and those who were not the most interested really\r\nsatisfied themselves with the truth that the tidings were better than\r\nthey might have been.\r\n\r\nThe damp upon the spirits of the party was most evident, when all had\r\ndescended from the carriages, and were collected in the woods.  There\r\nwas a general tremor about accidents.  If one of the gentlemen had gone\r\nforward to explore, or the children had lagged behind for play, there\r\nwas a shouting, and a general stop, till the missing party appeared.\r\nMiss Young would fain have declined her pony, which was duly in waiting\r\nfor her.  It was only because she felt that no individual could well be\r\nspared from the party that she mounted at all.  Mr Hope was to have had\r\nthe charge of her; and though she had requested Sydney to take his\r\nplace, as far as was necessary, Mr Enderby insisted on doing so; a\r\ncircumstance which did not add to her satisfaction.  She was not\r\naltogether so heart-sick as her friends, the Ibbotsons; but even to her,\r\neverything was weariness of spirit:--the landscape seemed dull; the\r\nsplendid dinner on the grass tiresome; the sunshine sickly; and even the\r\nchildren, with their laughter and practical jokes, fatiguing and\r\ntroublesome.  Even she could easily have spoken sharply to each and all\r\nof the little ones.  If she felt so, what must the day have been to\r\nHester?  She bore up well under any observation that she might suppose\r\nherself the object of; but Margaret saw how laboriously she strove, and\r\nin vain, to eat; how welcome was the glass of wine; how mechanical her\r\nsinging after dinner; and how impatient she was of sitting still.  The\r\nstrangest thing was to see her walking in a dim glade, in the afternoon,\r\narm-in-arm with Mrs Rowland,--as if in the most confidential\r\nconversation,--Mrs Rowland apparently offering the confidence, and\r\nHester receiving it.\r\n\r\n"Look at them!" said Mr Enderby.  "Who would believe that my sister\r\nprohibited solitary walks and _tete-a-tetes_, only three hours ago, on\r\nthe ground that every one ought to be sociable to-day?  I shall go and\r\nbreak up the conference."\r\n\r\n"Pray do not," said Margaret.  "Let them forget rules, and pass their\r\ntime as they like best."\r\n\r\n"Oh! but here is news of Hope.  Mr Grey has now brought word that he is\r\nno worse.  I begin to think he may get through, which, God knows I had\r\nno idea of this morning."\r\n\r\n"Do you really think so?  But do not tell other people, unless you are\r\nquite confident that you really mean what you say."\r\n\r\n"I may be wrong, of course: but I do think the chances improve with\r\nevery hour that he does not get worse; and he is certainly not worse.  I\r\nhave a strong presentiment that he will struggle through."\r\n\r\n"Go, then; and tell as many people as you choose: only make them\r\nunderstand how much is presentiment."\r\n\r\nThe _tete-a-tete_ between the ladies, being broken off by Mr Enderby\r\nwith his tidings, was not renewed.  Hester walked beside Miss Young\'s\r\npony, her cheek flushed, and her eye bright.  Margaret thought there was\r\npride underneath, and not merely the excitement of renewed hope, so\r\nfeeble as that hope must yet be, and so nearly crushed by suspense.\r\n\r\nBefore the hour fixed for the carriages to be in readiness, the party\r\nhad given up all pretence of amusing themselves and each other.  They\r\nsat on a ridge, watching the spot where the vehicles were to assemble;\r\nand message after message was sent to the servants, to desire them to\r\nmake haste.  The general wish seemed to be, to be getting home, though\r\nthe sun was yet some way from its setting.  When the first sound of\r\nwheels was heard, Hester whispered to her sister--"I cannot be in the\r\nsame carriage with that woman.  No; you must not either.  I cannot now\r\ntell you why.  I dare say Miss Young would take my place, and let me go\r\nwith the children in the waggon."\r\n\r\n"I will do that; and you shall return in Mr Rowland\'s gig.  You can\r\ntalk or not as you please with him; and he is very kind.  He is no more\r\nto be blamed for his wife\'s behaviour, you know, than her mother or her\r\nbrother.  It shall be so.  I will manage it."\r\n\r\nMargaret could manage what she pleased, with Maria and Mr Enderby both\r\ndevoted to her.  Hester was off with Mr Rowland, and Margaret with one\r\nchild on her lap, and the others rejoicing at having possession of her,\r\nbefore Mrs Rowland discovered the shifting of parties which had taken\r\nplace.  Often during the ride she wanted to speak to her brother: three\r\ntimes out of four he was not to be had, so busy was he joking with the\r\nchildren, as he trotted his horse beside the waggon; and when he did\r\nhear his sister\'s call he merely answered her questions, said something\r\nto make his mother laugh, and dropped into his place beside the waggon\r\nagain.  It struck Maria that the waggon had not been such an attraction\r\nin going, though the flowers with which it was canopied had then been\r\nfresh, and the children more merry and good-humoured than now.\r\n\r\nThe report to be carried home to Deerbrook was, that Mr Hope was still\r\nno worse: it was thought that his delirium was somewhat quieter.  Mrs\r\nGrey was out on the steps to hear the news, when the carriage\r\napproached.  As it happened, the gig arrived first, and Hester had to\r\ngive the relation.  She spoke even cheerfully, declaring Mr Enderby\'s\r\nopinion, that the case was going on favourably, and that recovery was\r\nvery possible.  Mrs Grey, who had had a wretchedly anxious day by\r\nherself, not having enjoyed even the satisfaction of being useful,\r\nnothing having been sent for from the farmhouse, was truly cheered by\r\nseeing her family about her again.\r\n\r\n"I have been watching for you this hour," said she; "and yet I hardly\r\nexpected you so soon.  As it grew late, I began to fancy all manner of\r\naccidents that might befall you.  When one accident happens, it makes\r\none fancy so many more!  I could not help thinking about Mr Grey\'s\r\nhorse.  Does that horse seem to you perfectly steady, Hester?  Well, I\r\nam glad of it: but I once saw it shy from some linen on a hedge, and it\r\nwas in my mind all this afternoon.  Here you are, all safe, however: and\r\nI trust we may feel more cheerfully now about our good friend.  If he\r\ngoes on to grow better, I shall get Mr Grey to drive me over soon to\r\nsee him.  But, my dears, what will you have after your ride?  Shall I\r\norder tea, or will you have something more substantial?"\r\n\r\n"Tea, if you please," said Hester.  Her tongue was parched: and when\r\nMargaret followed her up-stairs, she found her drinking water, as if she\r\nhad been three days deep in the Great Desert.\r\n\r\n"Can you tell me now," asked Margaret, "what Mrs Rowland has been\r\nsaying to you?"\r\n\r\n"No, not at present: better wait.  Margaret! what do you think now?"\r\n\r\n"I think that all looks brighter than it did this morning; but what a\r\nwretched day it has been!"\r\n\r\n"You found it so, did you?  Oh, Margaret, I have longed every hour to\r\nlie down to sleep in that wood, and never wake again!"\r\n\r\n"I do not wonder: but you will soon feel better.  The sleep from which\r\nyou will wake to-morrow morning will do nearly as well.  We must sleep\r\nto-night, and hope for good news in the morning."\r\n\r\n"No good news will ever come to me again," sighed Hester.  "No, no; I do\r\nnot quite mean that.  You need not look at me so.  It is ungrateful to\r\nsay such a thing at this moment.  Come: I am ready to go down to tea.\r\nIt is really getting dark.  I thought this day never would come to an\r\nend."\r\n\r\nThe evening was wearisome enough.  Mrs Grey asked how Mrs Rowland had\r\nbehaved, and Sophia was beginning to tell, when her father checked her,\r\nreminding her that she had been enjoying Mrs Rowland\'s hospitality.\r\nThis was all he said, but it was enough to bring on one of Sophia\'s\r\ninterminable fits of crying.  The children were cross with fatigue: Mrs\r\nGrey thought her husband hard upon Sophia; and, to complete the\r\nabsurdity of the scene, Hester\'s and Margaret\'s tears proved\r\nuncontrollable.  The sight of Sophia\'s set them flowing; and though they\r\nlaughed at themselves for the folly of weeping from mere sympathy, this\r\ndid not mend the matter.  Mrs Grey seemed on the verge of tears\r\nherself, when she observed that she had expected a cheerful evening\r\nafter a lonely and anxious day.  A deep sob from the three answered to\r\nthis observation, and they all rose to go to their apartments.  Hester\r\nwas struck by the peculiar tender pressure of the hand given her by Mr\r\nGrey, as she offered him her mute good-night.  It caused her a fresh\r\nburst of grief when she reached her own room.\r\n\r\nMargaret was determined not to go to rest without knowing what it was\r\nthat Mrs Rowland had said to her sister.  She pressed for it now,\r\nhoping that it would rouse Hester from more painful thoughts.\r\n\r\n"Though I have been enjoying that woman\'s hospitality, as Mr Grey\r\nsays," declared Hester, "I must speak of her as I think, to you.  Oh,\r\nshe has been so insolent!"\r\n\r\n"Insolent to you!  How?  Why?"\r\n\r\n"Nay: you had better ask her why.  Her confidence was all about her\r\nbrother.  She seems to think,--she did not say so, or I should have\r\nknown better how to answer her, but she seems to think that her brother\r\nis--(I can hardly speak it even to you, Margaret!)--is in some way in\r\ndanger from me.  Now, you and I know that he cares no more for me than\r\nfor any one of the people who were there to-day; and yet she went on\r\ntelling me, and I could not stop her, about the views of his family for\r\nhim!"\r\n\r\n"What views?"\r\n\r\n"Views which, I imagine, it by no means follows that he has for himself.\r\nIf she has been impertinent to me, she has been even more so to him.  I\r\nwonder how she dares meddle in his concerns as she does."\r\n\r\n"Well, but what views?" persisted Margaret.\r\n\r\n"Oh, about his marrying:--that he is the darling of his family,--that\r\nlarge family interests hang upon his marrying,--that all his relations\r\nthink it is time he was settling, and that he told her last week that he\r\nwas of that opinion himself:--and then she went on to say that there was\r\nthe most delightful accordance in their views for him;--that they did\r\nnot much value beauty,--that they should require for him something of a\r\nfar higher order than beauty, and which indeed was seldom found with\r\nit--"\r\n\r\n"Insolent creature!  Did she say that to you?"\r\n\r\n"Indeed she did: and that her brother\'s wife must be of a good family,\r\nwith a fortune worthy of his own; and, naturally, of a county family."\r\n\r\n"A county family!" said Margaret, half laughing.  "What matters county\r\nor city, when two people are watching over one another for life and\r\ndeath, and for hereafter?"\r\n\r\n"With such people as Mrs Rowland," said Hester, "marriage is a very\r\nsuperficial affair.  If family, fortune, and equipage are but right, the\r\nrest may be left to Providence.  Temper, mind, heart--.  The worst of\r\nall, however, was her ending--or what was made her ending by our being\r\ninterrupted."\r\n\r\n"Well! what was her finish?"\r\n\r\n"She put her face almost under my bonnet, as she looked smiling at me,\r\nand said there was a young lady--she wished she could tell me all about\r\nit--the time would come when she might--there was a sweet girl, beloved\r\nby them all for many years, from her very childhood, whom they had hopes\r\nof receiving, at no very distant time, as Philip\'s wife."\r\n\r\n"I do not believe it," cried Margaret.  After a pause, she added, "Do\r\nyou believe it, Hester?"\r\n\r\n"I am sure I do not know.  I should not rate Mrs Rowland\'s word very\r\nhighly: but this would be such a prodigious falsehood!  It is possible,\r\nhowever, that she may believe it without its being true.  Or, such a\r\nwoman might make the most, for the occasion, of a mere suspicion of her\r\nown."\r\n\r\n"I do not believe it is true," repeated Margaret.\r\n\r\n"At all events," concluded Hester, "nothing that Mrs Rowland says is\r\nworth regarding.  I was foolish to let myself be ruffled by her."\r\n\r\nMargaret tried to take the lesson home, but it was in vain.  She was\r\nruffled; and, in spite of every effort, she did believe in the existence\r\nof the nameless young lady.  It had been a day of trouble; and thus was\r\nit ending in fresh sorrow and fear.\r\n\r\nMorris came in, hesitated at the door, was told she might stay, and\r\nimmediately busied herself in the brushing of hair and the folding of\r\nclothes.  Many tears trickled down, and not a word was spoken, till all\r\nthe offices of the toilet were finished.  Morris then asked, with a\r\nglance at the book-shelf, whether she should go or stay.\r\n\r\n"Stay, Morris," said Hester, gently.  "You shall not suffer for our\r\nbeing unhappy to-night.  Margaret, will you, can you read?"\r\n\r\nMargaret took the volume in which it was the sisters\' common practice to\r\nread together, and with Morris at night.  While Morris took her seat,\r\nand reverently composed herself to hear, Margaret turned to the words\r\nwhich have stilled many a tempest of grief, from the moment when they\r\nwere first uttered to mourners, through a long course of centuries, "Let\r\nnot your heart be troubled."  "Believe in God; believe in me."  Morris\r\nsometimes spoke on these occasions.  She loved to hear of the many\r\nmansions in the House of the Father of all; and she said that though it\r\nmight seem to her young ladies that their parents had gone there full\r\nsoon, leaving them to undergo trouble by themselves, yet she had no\r\ndoubt they should all be at peace together, sooner or later, and their\r\npassing troubles seem as nothing.  Even this simple and obvious remark\r\nroused courage in the sisters.  They remembered what their father had\r\nsaid to them about his leaving them to encounter the serious business\r\nand trials of life, and how they had promised to strive to be wise and\r\ntrustful, and to help each other.  This day the serious business and\r\ntrials of life had manifestly begun: they must strengthen themselves and\r\neach other to meet them.  They agreed upon this, and in a mood of faith\r\nand resolution fell asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER ELEVEN.\r\n\r\nMEDIATION.\r\n\r\nMr Hope\'s case turned out more favourably than any of his attendants\r\nand friends had ventured to anticipate.  For some days the symptoms\r\ncontinued as alarming as at first; but from the hour that he began to\r\namend, his progress towards recovery was without drawback, and unusually\r\nrapid.  Within a month, the news circulated through the village, that he\r\nhad been safely brought home to his own lodgings; and the day after, the\r\nladies at Mr Grey\'s were startled by seeing him alight from a gig at\r\nthe door, and walk up the steps feebly, but without assistance.  He\r\ncould not stay away any longer, he declared.  He had been above a month\r\nshut up in a dim room, without seeing any faces but of doctor, nurse,\r\nand Mrs Grey, and debarred from books; now he was well enough to\r\nprescribe for himself; and he was sure that a little society, and a\r\ngradual return to his usual habits of life, would do him more good than\r\nanything.\r\n\r\nMrs Grey kept all her own children out of sight during this first\r\nvisit, that Mr Hope might not see too many faces at once.  She admitted\r\nonly Hester and Margaret, and Alice, who brought him some refreshment.\r\nThe girl made him a low curtsey, and looked at him with an expression of\r\nawe and pleasure, which brought tears into the eyes of even her\r\nmistress.  Mr Hope had been a benefactor to this girl.  He had brought\r\nher through a fever.  She had of late little expected ever to see him\r\nagain.  Mr Hope replied to her mute looks:\r\n\r\n"Thank you, Alice, I am much better.  I hope to be quite well soon.  Did\r\nnot you make some of the good things Mrs Grey has been kind enough to\r\nbring me?--I thought so.  Well, I\'m much obliged to you; and to\r\neverybody who has been taking pains to make me well.  I do not know how\r\nit is," he continued, when Alice had left the room, "but things do not\r\nappear as they used to do.  Perhaps my eyes are dim still; but the room\r\ndoes not seem bright, and none of you look well and merry."\r\n\r\nMrs Grey observed that she had drawn the blinds down, thinking he would\r\nfind it a relief after the sunshine.  Margaret said ingenuously--\r\n\r\n"We are all well, I assure you; but you should not wonder if you find us\r\nrather grave.  Much has happened since we met.  We have been thinking of\r\nyou with great anxiety for so long, that we cannot on a sudden talk as\r\nlightly as when you used to come in every day."\r\n\r\n"Ah!" said he, "I little thought, at one time, that I should ever see\r\nany of you again in this world."\r\n\r\n"We have thought of you as near death," said Margaret; "and since that,\r\nas having a sick-room experience, which we respect and stand in awe of;\r\nand that is reason enough for our looking grave."\r\n\r\n"You feel as if you had to become acquainted with me over again.  Well,\r\nwe must lose no time; here is a month gone that I can give no account\r\nof."\r\n\r\nHester felt how differently the case stood with her.  The last month had\r\nbeen the longest she had ever known,--tedious as to the state captive,\r\nserving his noviciate to prison life.  She would have been thankful to\r\nsay that she could give no account of the past month.  She inquired how\r\nthe accident happened; for this was still a mystery to everybody.  Mr\r\nHope could not clear up the matter: he remembered parting with Sydney,\r\nand trotting, with the bridle of the pony in his hand, to the top of the\r\nascent,--the point where Sydney lost sight of him: he had no distinct\r\nremembrance of anything more,--only a sort of impression of his horse\r\nrearing bolt upright.  He had never been thrown before; and his\r\nsupposition was, that a stone cast from behind the hedge might have\r\nstruck his horse: but he really knew no more of the affair than any one\r\nelse.  The ladies all trusted he would not ride the same horse again;\r\nbut this he would not promise: his horse was an old friend; and he was\r\nnot in a hurry to part with old friends.  He was glad to find that Miss\r\nYoung had not laid the blame on the pony, but had ridden it through the\r\nwoods as if nothing had happened.\r\n\r\n"Not exactly so," said Margaret, smiling.\r\n\r\n"The young folks did not enjoy their excursion very much, I fancy," said\r\nMrs Grey, smiling also.  "Mrs Rowland was quite put out, poor soul!\r\nYou know she thinks everything goes wrong, on purpose to plague her."\r\n\r\n"I think she had some higher feelings on that occasion," said Mr Hope,\r\ngently, but gravely.  "I am indebted to her for a very anxious concern\r\non my account, and for kind offices in which perhaps none of my many\r\ngenerous friends have surpassed her."\r\n\r\nMrs Grey, somewhat abashed, said that Mrs Rowland had some good\r\nqualities: it was only a pity that her unhappy temper did not allow them\r\nfair play.\r\n\r\n"It is a pity," observed Mr Hope; "and it is at the same time, an\r\nappeal to us to allow her the fair play she does not afford herself.\r\nThat sofa looks delightfully comfortable, Mrs Grey."\r\n\r\n"Oh, you are tired; you are faint, perhaps?"\r\n\r\n"Shall I ring?" said Hester, moving to the bell.\r\n\r\n"No, no," said he, laughing; "I am very well at present.  I only mean\r\nthat I should like to stay all day, if you will let me.  I am sure that\r\nsofa is full as comfortable as my own.  I may stay, may I not?"\r\n\r\n"No, indeed you shall not, this first day.  If you will go away now\r\nbefore you are tired, and if I find when I look in upon you this\r\nevening, that you are not the worse for this feat, you shall stay longer\r\nto-morrow.  But I assure you it is time you were at home now.  My dears,\r\njust see whether the gig is at the door."\r\n\r\n"So I only get sent away by begging to stay," said Mr Hope.  "Well, I\r\nhave been giving orders to sick people for so many years, that I suppose\r\nit is fairly my turn to obey now.  May I ask you to send to Widow Rye\'s\r\nto-day?  I looked in as I came; and her child is in want of better food,\r\nbetter cooked, than she is able to give him."\r\n\r\n"I will send him a dinner from our table.  You are not going to see any\r\nmore patients to-day, I hope?"\r\n\r\n"Only two that lie quite in my road.  If you send me away, you must take\r\nthe consequences.  Farewell, till tomorrow."\r\n\r\n"Mr Grey and I shall look in upon you this evening.  Now do not look\r\nabout you out of doors, to catch anybody\'s eye, or you will be visiting\r\na dozen patients between this house and your own."\r\n\r\nThere were, indeed, many people standing about, within sight of Mr\r\nGrey\'s door, to see Mr Hope come out.  All Mr Grey\'s children and\r\nservants were peeping through the shrubbery.  Mrs Enderby waved her\r\nhand from a lower, and her two maids looked out from an upper window.\r\nThe old man of a hundred years, who was sunning himself on the bank, as\r\nusual, rose and took off his hat: and the little Reeves and their\r\nschoolfellows stood whispering to one another that Mr Hope looked\r\nrarely bad still.  Mrs Plumstead dropped a low curtsey, as she stood\r\ntaking in the letter-bag, at her distant door.  Mrs Grey observed to\r\nHester on the respect which was paid to Mr Hope all through the place,\r\nas if Hester was not feeling it in her heart of hearts at the moment.\r\n\r\nMrs Grey flattered herself that Mr Hope was thinking of Hester when he\r\nsaid his friends did not look well.  She had been growing thinner and\r\npaler for the last month, and no doubt remained in Mrs Grey\'s mind\r\nabout the cause.  Hester had commanded herself, to her sister\'s\r\nadmiration; but she could not command her health, and that was giving\r\nway under perpetual feelings of anxiety and humiliation.  Mrs Grey\r\nthought all this had gone quite far enough.  She was more fond and proud\r\nof Hester every day, and more impatient that she should be happy, the\r\nmore she watched her.  She spoke to Margaret about her.  Margaret was\r\nprepared for this, having foreseen its probability; and her answers,\r\nwhile perfectly true and sincere, were so guarded, that Mrs Grey drew\r\nfrom them the comfortable inference that she alone penetrated the\r\nmatter, and understood Hester\'s state of mind.  She came to the\r\nresolution at last of making the young people happy a little sooner than\r\nthey could have managed the affair for themselves.  She would help them\r\nto an understanding, but it should be with all possible delicacy and\r\nregard to their feelings.  Not even Mr Grey should know what she was\r\nabout.\r\n\r\nOpportunities were not wanting.  When are opportunities wanting to\r\nmatch-makers?  If such do not find means of carrying their points, they\r\ncan construct them.  Few match-makers go to work so innocently and\r\nsecurely as Mrs Grey; for few can be so certain of the inclinations of\r\nthe parties as she believed herself.  Her own admiration of Hester was\r\nso exclusive, and the superiority of Hester\'s beauty so unquestionable,\r\nthat it never occurred to her that the attraction which drew Mr Hope to\r\nthe house could be any other than this.  About the state of Hester\'s\r\naffections she felt justly confident; and so, in her view, nothing\r\nremained to be done but to save her from further pining by bringing\r\nabout an explanation.  She was frequently with Mr Hope at his lodgings,\r\nduring his recovery, seeing that he took his afternoon rest, and\r\nbeguiling a part of his evenings; in short, watching over him as over a\r\nson, and declaring to Hester that he was no less dear to her.\r\n\r\nOne evening, when she was spending an hour in Mr Hope\'s parlour, where\r\nMr Grey had deposited her till nine o\'clock, when he was to call for\r\nher, she made the same affectionate declaration to Mr Hope himself,--\r\nthat he was as dear to her as if he had been her own son; "and," she\r\ncontinued, "I shall speak to you with the same freedom as I should use\r\nwith Sydney, and may, perhaps, ten years hence."\r\n\r\n"Pray do," said Mr Hope.  "I shall be glad to hear anything you have to\r\nsay.  Are you going to find fault with me?"\r\n\r\n"Oh dear, no!  What fault should I have to find with you? unless,\r\nindeed, it be a fault or a folly to leave your own happiness and that of\r\nanother person in needless uncertainty."\r\n\r\nMr Hope changed colour, quite to the extent of her wishes.\r\n\r\n"I know," continued she, "that your illness has put a stop to\r\neverything; and that it has left you little nerve for any explanation of\r\nthe kind: but you are growing stronger every day now, and the case is\r\nbecoming so serious on the other side that I own I dread the\r\nconsequences of much further delay.  You see I speak openly."\r\n\r\nShe had every encouragement to do so, for Mr Hope\'s countenance was\r\nflushed with what appeared to her to be delight.  "You observed,\r\nyourself, you know, that Hester did not look well; and indeed the few\r\nweeks after your accident were so trying to her,--the exertions she made\r\nto conceal her feelings were so--.  But I must spare her delicacy.  I\r\ntrust you are quite assured that she has not the most remote idea of my\r\nspeaking to you thus.  Indeed, no human being is in the least aware of\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"Hester!  Miss Ibbotson!  Pray, Mrs Grey, do not say another word.  Let\r\nus talk of something else."\r\n\r\n"Presently; when I have finished.  You must have seen that I love this\r\ndear girl as a daughter; and there is not a thought of her heart that\r\nshe can conceal from me, though her delicacy is so great that I am\r\nconfident she thinks me unaware of her state of mind at this moment.\r\nBut I saw how the affair was going from the very beginning; and the\r\nfailure of her health and looks since your accident have left me no\r\ndoubt whatever, and have made me feel it my duty to give you the\r\nencouragement your modesty requires, and to confide to you how wholly\r\nher happiness lies in your hands."\r\n\r\n"Hester!  Miss Ibbotson!  I assure you, Mrs Grey, you must be\r\ncompletely mistaken."\r\n\r\n"I beg your pardon: I am not so easily mistaken as some people.  There\r\nis Mrs Rowland, now!  I am sure she fancies that her brother is in love\r\nwith Hester, when it is plain to everybody but herself that he and my\r\nother young cousin are coming to a conclusion as fast as need be.\r\nHowever, I know you do not like to hear me find fault with Mrs Rowland;\r\nand, besides, I have no right to tell Margaret\'s secrets; so we will say\r\nno more about that."\r\n\r\nMr Hope sighed heavily.  These remarks upon Enderby and Margaret\r\naccorded but too well with his own observations.  He could not let Mrs\r\nGrey proceed without opposition; but all he was capable of was to repeat\r\nthat she was entirely mistaken.\r\n\r\n"Yes, that is what men like you always say,--in all sincerity, of\r\ncourse.  Your modesty always stands in the way of your happiness for a\r\nwhile: but you are no losers by it.  The happiness is all the sweeter\r\nwhen it comes at last."\r\n\r\n"But that is not what I mean.  You have made it difficult for me to\r\nexplain myself.  I hardly know how to say it; but it must be said.  You\r\nhave mistaken my intentions,--mistaken them altogether."\r\n\r\nIt was now Mrs Grey\'s turn to change colour.  She asked in a trembling\r\nvoice:\r\n\r\n"Do you mean to say, Mr Hope, that you have not been paying attentions\r\nto Hester Ibbotson?"\r\n\r\n"I do say so; that I have paid no attentions of the nature you suppose.\r\nYou compel me to speak plainly."\r\n\r\n"Then I must speak plainly too, Mr Hope.  If any one had told me you\r\nwould play the part you have played, I should have resented the\r\nimputation as I resent your conduct now.  If you have not intended to\r\nwin Hester\'s affections, you have behaved infamously.  You have won her\r\nattachment by attentions which have never varied, from the very first\r\nevening that she entered our house, till this afternoon.  You have\r\namused yourself with her, it seems; and now you are going to break her\r\nheart."\r\n\r\n"Stop, stop, Mrs Grey!  I cannot hear this."\r\n\r\n"There is not a soul in the place that does not think as I do.  There is\r\nnot a soul that will not say--."\r\n\r\n"Let us put aside what people may say.  If, by any imprudence of my own,\r\nI have brought blame upon myself, I must bear it.  The important point\r\nis--.  Surely, Mrs Grey, it is possible that you may be in error about\r\nMiss Ibbotson\'s--Miss Ibbotson\'s state of mind."\r\n\r\n"No, Mr Hope, it is not possible."  And being in for it, as she said,\r\nMrs Grey gave such a detail of her observations, and of unquestionable\r\nfacts, as left the truth indeed in little doubt.\r\n\r\n"And Margaret," said Mr Hope, in a troubled voice: "do you know\r\nanything of her views of my conduct?"\r\n\r\n"Margaret is not so easily seen through as Hester," said Mrs Grey: an\r\nassertion from which Mr Hope silently dissented; Margaret appearing to\r\nhim the most simple-minded person he had ever known; lucid in her\r\nsincerity, transparent in her unconsciousness.  He was aware that Mrs\r\nGrey had been so occupied with Hester as not to have been open to\r\nimpression from Margaret.\r\n\r\n"Margaret is not so easily seen through as Hester, you know; and she and\r\nI have never talked over your conduct confidentially: but if Margaret\r\ndoes not perceive the alteration in her sister, and the cause of it, it\r\ncan only be because she is occupied with her own concerns."\r\n\r\n"That is not like Margaret," thought Mr Hope.\r\n\r\n"However, she does see it, I am sure; for she has proposed their return\r\nto Birmingham,--their immediate return, though their affairs are far\r\nfrom being settled yet, and they do not know what they will have to live\r\nupon.  They promised to stay till October, too; and we are only half\r\nthrough August yet.  Margaret can hardly have any wish to leave us on\r\nher own account, considering whom she must leave behind.  It is for\r\nHester\'s sake, I am confident.  There is no doubt of the fact, Mr Hope.\r\nYour honour is involved.  I repeat, you have won this dear girl\'s\r\naffections; and now you must act as a man of conscience, which I have\r\nalways supposed you to be."\r\n\r\nMr Hope was tempted to ask for further confirmation, from the opinions\r\nof the people who were about Hester; but he would not investigate the\r\ndegree of exposure which might have taken place.  Even if no one agreed\r\nwith Mrs Grey, this would be no proof that her conviction was a wrong\r\none; it might happen through Hester\'s successful concealment of what she\r\nmust be striving to suppress.\r\n\r\nMrs Grey urged him about his honour and conscience more closely than he\r\ncould bear.  He faintly begged her to leave him.  He obtained from her a\r\npromise that she would inform no person of what had been said; and she\r\nagain assured him that neither Hester, nor any one else, had the\r\nremotest idea of her speaking as she had done this evening.  On his\r\npart, Mr Hope declared that he should reflect on what had passed, and\r\nact with the strictest regard to duty.  As, in Mrs Grey\'s eyes, his\r\nduty was perfectly clear, this declaration was completely satisfactory.\r\nShe saw the young people, with her mind\'s eye, settled in the corner\r\nhouse which belonged to Mr Rowland, and was delighted that she had\r\nspoken.  As soon as she was gone, Mr Hope would discover, she had\r\nlittle doubt, that he had loved Hester all this time without having been\r\nconscious what the attraction had really been; and in a little while he\r\nwould be thankful to her for having smoothed his way for him.  With\r\nthese thoughts in her mind, she bade him good-night, just as Mr Grey\r\ndrove up to the door.  She whispered once more, that he was as dear to\r\nher as a son, and that this was the reason of her having spoken so\r\nplainly.\r\n\r\n"How are you this evening, Hope?" said Mr Grey, from the doorway.  "On\r\nthe sofa, eh? don\'t rise for me, then.  Rather done up, eh?  Ah!  I was\r\nafraid you were for getting on too fast.  Bad economy in the end.  You\r\nwill be glad to be rid of us: so I shall not come in.  Take care of\r\nyourself, I beg of you.  Good-night."\r\n\r\nIn what a state of mind was Hope left!  His plain-speaking motherly\r\nfriend little guessed what a storm she had raised in a spirit usually as\r\ncalm as a summer\'s morning.  There was nothing to him so abhorrent as\r\ngiving pain; nothing so intolerable in idea as injuring any human being:\r\nand he was now compelled to believe that through some conduct of his\r\nown, some imprudence, in a case where imprudence is guilt, he had broken\r\nup the peace of a woman whom, though he did not love, he respected and\r\nwarmly regarded!  His mind was in too tumultuous a state for him to\r\nattempt to settle with himself the degree of his culpability.  He only\r\nknew that he was abased in his own sense of deep injury towards a\r\nfellow-creature.  In the same breath came the destruction of his\r\nhopes,--hopes, of which, till the moment, he had been scarcely\r\nconscious,--with regard to the one on whom his thoughts had been really\r\nfixed.  He had pledged himself to act strictly according to his sense of\r\nduty.  His consolation, his refuge in every former trial of life, since\r\nthe days of childhood, had been in resolving to abide faithfully by the\r\ndecisions of duty.  In this he had found freedom; in this he had met\r\nstrength and repose, so that no evil had been intolerable to him.  But\r\nwhat was his duty now?  Amidst the contradictions of honour and\r\nconscience in the present case, where should he find his accustomed\r\nrefuge?  At one moment he saw clearly the obligation to devote himself\r\nto her whose affections he had gained,--thoughtlessly and carelessly, it\r\nis true, but to other eyes purposely.  At the next moment, the sin of\r\nmarrying without love,--if not while loving another,--rose vividly\r\nbefore him, and made him shrink from what, an instant before, seemed\r\nclear duty.  The only hope was in the possibility of mistake, which\r\nmight yet remain.  The whole could not be mistake, about Hester, and\r\nEnderby, and Margaret, and all Mrs Grey\'s convictions.  Some of all\r\nthis must be true.  The probability was that it was all true: and if\r\nso,--he could almost repine that he had not died when his death was\r\nexpected.  Then he should not have known of all this injury and woe;\r\nthen he should not have had to witness Margaret\'s love for another: then\r\nHester\'s quiet grief would have melted away with time, unembittered by\r\nreproach of him.  No one had, till this hour, loved and relished life\r\nmore than he; yet now this gladsome being caught himself mourning that\r\nhe had survived his accident.  He roused himself from this; but all was\r\nfearful and confused before him.  He could see nothing as it was, and as\r\nit ought to be: he could decide upon nothing.  He must take time: he\r\nmust be deliberate upon this, the most important transaction of his\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThus he determined, as the last remains of twilight faded away in his\r\napartment, and the night air blew in chill from the open window.  He was\r\nso exhausted by his mental conflict as to be scarcely able to rise to\r\nclose the window, and retire to rest.  There was one hope, familiar as\r\nthe sunshine to his eyes, but unusually feeble, still abiding in his\r\nmind for comfort,--that he should, sooner or later, clearly discern what\r\nit was his duty to do.  All was at present dark; but this light might\r\nflow in.  He would wait: he would not act till it did.\r\n\r\nHe did wait.  For many days he was not seen in any of the haunts, to\r\nwhich he had begun to return.  The answer to inquiries was that Mr Hope\r\nwas not so well, and wished for entire quiet.  Everyone was anxious.\r\nHester was wretched, and Mrs Grey extremely restless and uneasy.  She\r\nmade several attempts to see him; but in no instance did she succeed.\r\nShe wrote him a private note, and received only a friendly verbal\r\nanswer, such as all the world might hear.\r\n\r\nMr Hope did wait for his duty to grow clear in the accumulating light\r\nof thought.  He decided at length how to act; and he decided wrong;--not\r\nfor want of waiting long enough, but because some considerations\r\nintruded themselves which warped his judgment, and sophisticated his\r\nfeelings.  He decided upon making the great mistake of his life.\r\n\r\nNothing had ever been clearer to his mind than the guilt of marrying\r\nwithout love.  No man could have spoken more strongly, more solemnly\r\nthan he, on the presumption, the dishonourableness, the profligacy, of\r\nsuch an act: but he was unaware how a man may be betrayed into it while\r\nhe has neither presumption, nor treachery, nor profligacy in his\r\nthoughts.  Hope went through a world of meditation during the days of\r\nhis close retirement; some of his thoughts were superficial, and some\r\ndeceived him.  He considered Margaret lost to him: he glanced forwards\r\nto his desolation when he should lose the society of both sisters--an\r\nevent likely to happen almost immediately, unless he should so act as to\r\nretain them.  He dwelt upon Hester\'s beauty, her superiority of mind to\r\nevery woman but one whom he had known, her attachment to himself; her\r\ndependence upon him.  He pondered these things till the tone of his mind\r\nwas lowered, and too many superficial feelings mingled with the\r\nsacredness of the transaction, and impaired its integrity.  Under their\r\ninfluence he decided what to do.\r\n\r\nHe had no intention, all this while, of taking Mrs Grey\'s word for the\r\nwhole matter, without test or confirmation.  From the beginning, he was\r\naware that his first step must be to ascertain that she was not\r\nmistaken.  And this was his first step.\r\n\r\nThere were two obvious methods of proceeding.  One was to consult Mr\r\nGrey, who stood in the place of guardian to these girls, as to the\r\nprobability of his success with Hester, in case of his proposing himself\r\nto her.  The other was to ask the same question of Margaret.  The\r\nadvantage of speaking to Mr Grey was, that he might not be bound to\r\nproceed, in case of Mr Grey differing from his lady\'s view of the case;\r\nbut then, Mr Grey was perhaps unaware of the real state of Hester\'s\r\nmind.  From Margaret there was certainty of hearing nothing but the\r\ntruth, however little of it her feelings for her sister might allow her\r\nto reveal; but such a conversation with her would compel him to proceed:\r\nall retreat would be cut off after it; and he naturally shrank from\r\nconversing with Margaret, of all people, on this subject.  But Hope was\r\nequal to any effort which he thought a matter of duty; and he resolved\r\nnot to flinch from this.  He would speak first to Mr Grey; and if Mr\r\nGrey did not undertake to answer for Hester\'s indifference, he would\r\nseek an interview with Margaret.  If Margaret should encourage his\r\nadvances on her sister\'s behalf; the matter was decided.  He should have\r\na wife who might be the pride of any man,--whom it would be an honour to\r\nany man to have attached.  If, as was still just possible, Margaret\r\nshould believe that her sister felt no peculiar regard for him, he\r\nthought he might intimate so much of the truth as, without offending her\r\nfeelings on her sister\'s account, would secure for him freedom to\r\nreconsider his purposes.  No man disliked more than he so circuitous a\r\nmethod of acting in the most important affair of life.  He had always\r\nbelieved that, in the case of a genuine and virtuous attachment, there\r\ncan or ought to be nothing but the most entire simplicity of conduct in\r\nthe parties,--no appeal to any but each other,--no seeking of an\r\nintervention, where no stranger ought to intermeddle with the joy: but\r\nthe present affair, though perpetually brightening before Hope\'s fancy,\r\ncould not for a moment be thought of as of this kind: and here the\r\ncircuitous method, which had always appeared disgusting to his\r\nimagination, was a matter of necessity to his conscience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWELVE.\r\n\r\nA TURN IN THE SHRUBBERY.\r\n\r\nMr Grey looked extremely pleased when asked whether he supposed Hester\r\nmight be won.  His reply was simple enough.  He was not in his young\r\ncousin\'s confidence: he could not undertake to answer for the state of\r\nmind of young ladies; but he knew of no other attachment,--of nothing\r\nwhich need discourage his friend Hope, who would have his hearty good\r\nwishes if he should persevere in his project.  Yes, yes; he fully\r\nunderstood: it was not to be spoken of;--it was to rest entirely between\r\nthemselves till Hope should have felt his way a little.  He knew it was\r\nthe fashion in these days to feel the way a little more than was thought\r\nnecessary or desirable in his time: but he liked that all should follow\r\ntheir own method in an affair which concerned themselves so much more\r\nthan any one else: so the matter should be a perfect secret, as Mr Hope\r\ndesired; though he did not fancy it would have to be kept so close for\r\nany great length of time.\r\n\r\nThis was over.  Now for the interview with Margaret, which had become\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nHis reappearance in the family party at Mr Grey\'s, under the\r\ninquisitive eyes of Mrs Grey herself, must be an awkward business at\r\nthe best, while he remained in uncertainty.  The only way was to put an\r\nend to the uncertainty as soon as possible.  He would go this very\r\nafternoon, and ascertain his fate before the day was over.  He went\r\nboldly up to the door and rang.  "The family were all out in the garden\r\nafter dinner," Alice said: "would Mr Hope join them there, or would he\r\nrest himself while she told them he had arrived?"  Alice\'s anxiety about\r\nhis looks was not yet satisfied.\r\n\r\n"I will step in here," said he, the door of the blue parlour being open.\r\n"Send Morris to me," Morris at that moment crossing the hall.  "Morris,\r\nI want to see Miss Margaret.  Will you just tell her that some one\r\nwishes to speak with her?  I know she will excuse my asking the favour\r\nof her to come in."\r\n\r\n"Miss Margaret, sir?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"I am sure, sir, you look more fit to sit here than to be gathering\r\napples with them all in the orchard.  Did you say Miss Margaret, sir?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Whatever else may be in Morris\'s mind," thought Hope, "it is clear that\r\nshe is surprised at my wanting to see Margaret.--Here she comes."\r\n\r\nHe was not sorry that the step paused in the hall,--that there was a\r\ndelay of some seconds before Margaret appeared.  He felt as weak at the\r\nmoment as on first rising from his bed after his accident; but he\r\nrallied his resolution before he met her eye,--now timid and shrinking\r\nas he had never seen it before.  Margaret was very grave, and as nearly\r\nawkward as it was possible for her to be.  She shook hands with him,\r\nhowever, and hoped that he was better again.\r\n\r\n"I am better, thank you.  Will you sit down, and let me speak to you for\r\na few minutes?"\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to refuse.  Margaret sank down, while he shut the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n"I hear," said he, "that you are already thinking of returning to\r\nBirmingham.  Is this true?"\r\n\r\n"Yes: we shall go home in a few days."\r\n\r\n"Then, before you leave us, will you allow me to ask your advice--?"\r\n\r\nAt the word "advice" a glow of pleasure passed over Margaret\'s face, and\r\nshe could not quite suppress a sigh of relief.  She now looked up freely\r\nand fearlessly.  All this was good for Mr Hope: but it went to his\r\nheart, and for a moment checked his speech.  He soon proceeded, however.\r\n\r\n"I want your advice as a friend, and also some information which you\r\nalone can give me.  What I have to say relates to your sister."\r\n\r\nMargaret\'s ecstasy of hope was scarcely controllable.  For her sister\'s\r\nsake she hung her head upon her bosom, the better to conceal her joy.\r\nIt was a bitter moment for him who could not but note and rightly\r\ninterpret the change in her countenance and manner.\r\n\r\n"I wish to know, if you have no objection to tell me, whether your\r\nsister is disengaged."\r\n\r\n"I have no objection to say," declared Margaret, looking up cheerfully,\r\n"that my sister is not engaged."\r\n\r\n"That is the information I wished for.  Now for the opinion which I\r\nventure to ask of you, as of the one to whom your sister\'s mind is best\r\nknown.  Do you believe that, if I attempt it, I am likely to win her?"\r\n\r\nMargaret was silent.  It was difficult to answer the question with\r\nperfect truth, and with due consideration to her sister.\r\n\r\n"I see," said Hope, "that you do not approve my question: nor do I\r\nmyself.  Rather tell me whether you suppose that she prefers any one to\r\nme,--that she had rather I should not seek her,--whether, in short, you\r\nwould advise me to withdraw."\r\n\r\n"By no means," said Margaret.  "I cannot say anything tending to deter\r\nyou.  I know of nothing which need discourage you; and I assure you, you\r\nhave my best wishes that you may succeed."\r\n\r\nShe looked at him with the bright expression of sincerity and regard\r\nwhich had touched his heart oftener and more deeply than all Hester\'s\r\nbeauty.  He could not have offered to shake hands at the moment; but she\r\nheld out hers, and he could not but take it.  The door burst open at the\r\nsame instant, and Mr Enderby entered.  Both let drop the hand they\r\nheld, and looked extremely awkward and grave.  A single glance was\r\nenough to send Mr Enderby away, without having spoken his errand, which\r\nwas to summon Margaret to the orchard, for the final shake of the\r\napple-tree.  When he was gone, each saw that the face of the other was\r\ncrimson: but while Hope had a look of distress which Margaret wondered\r\nat, remembering how soon Mr Enderby would understand the nature of the\r\ninterview, she was struggling to restrain a laugh.\r\n\r\n"Thank you for your truth," said Mr Hope.  "I knew I might depend upon\r\nit from you."\r\n\r\n"I have told you all I can," said Margaret rising; "and it will be best\r\nto say no more at present.  It is due to my sister to close our\r\nconversation here.  If she should choose," continued she, gaily, "to\r\ngive us leave to renew it hereafter, I shall have a great deal to say to\r\nyou on my own part.  You have done me the honour of calling me `friend.\'\r\nYou have my friendship, I assure you, and my good wishes."\r\n\r\nHope grasped her hand with a fervour which absolved him from the use of\r\nwords.  He then opened the door for her.\r\n\r\n"I must return to the orchard," said she.  "Will you go? or will you\r\nrepose yourself here till we come in to tea?"\r\n\r\nMr Hope preferred remaining where he was.  The die was cast, and he\r\nmust think.  His hour of meditation was salutary.  He had never seen\r\nMargaret so--he dared not dwell upon it: but then, never had her\r\nsimplicity of feeling towards him, her ingenuous friendship, unmixed\r\nwith a thought of love, been so clear.  He had made no impression upon\r\nher, except through her sister, and for her sister.  He recalled the\r\nstiffness and fear with which she had come when summoned to a\r\n_tete-a-tete_; her sudden relief on the mention of her sister; and her\r\njoyous encouragement of his project.\r\n\r\n"I ought to rejoice--I do rejoice at this," thought he.  "It seems as if\r\neveryone else would be made happy by this affair.  It must have been my\r\nown doing; there must have been that in my manner and conduct which\r\nauthorised all this expectation and satisfaction,--an expectation and\r\nsatisfaction which prove to be no fancy of Mrs Grey\'s.  I have brought\r\nupon myself the charge of Hester\'s happiness.  She is a noble woman,\r\nbound to me by all that can engage my honour, my generosity, my\r\naffection.  She shall be happy from this day, if my most entire devotion\r\ncan make her so.  Margaret loves Enderby: I am glad I know it.  I made\r\nhim dreadfully jealous just now; I must relieve him as soon as possible.\r\nI do not know how far matters may have gone between them; but Margaret\r\nis not at liberty to explain what he saw till I have spoken to Hester.\r\nThere must be no delay: I will do it this evening.  I cannot bring\r\nmyself to communicate with Mrs Grey.  If Mr Grey is at home, he will\r\nmake the opportunity for me."\r\n\r\nMr Grey was at home, and on the alert to take a hint.  "I guessed how\r\nit was," said he.  "Margaret has been trying to keep down her spirits,\r\nbut not a child among them all flew about the orchard as she did, when\r\nMr Enderby had been to look for her, and she followed him back.  I\r\nthought at first it was something on her own account; but Enderby looked\r\ntoo dull and sulky for that.  I have no doubt he is jealous of you.  He\r\nfound you together, did he?  Well, he will soon know why, I trust.  Oh,\r\nyou have a hearty well-wisher in Margaret, I am sure!  Now, you see they\r\nare setting Sophia down to the piano; and I think I can find for you the\r\nopportunity you want, if you really wish to bring the business to a\r\nconclusion this evening.  I will call Hester out to take a turn with me\r\nin the shrubbery, as she and I often do, these fine evenings; and then,\r\nif you choose, you can meet us there."\r\n\r\nHester was not at all sorry to be invited by Mr Grey to the turn in the\r\nshrubbery, which was one of the best of her quiet pleasures,--a solace\r\nwhich she enjoyed the more, the more she became attached to kind Mr\r\nGrey: and she did much respect and love him.  This evening she was glad\r\nof any summons from the room.  Margaret had fully intended not to speak\r\nto her of what had passed, thinking it best for her sister\'s dignity,\r\nand for Mr Hope\'s satisfaction, that he should not be anticipated.  All\r\nthis was very wise and undeniable while she was walking back to the\r\norchard: but it so happened that Hester\'s hand hung by her side, as she\r\nstood looking up at the apple-tree, unaware that Margaret had left the\r\nparty.  Margaret could not resist seizing the hand, and pressing it with\r\nso much silent emotion, such a glance of joy, as threw Hester into a\r\nstate of wonder and expectation.  Not a syllable could she extort from\r\nMargaret, either on the spot or afterwards, when summoned to tea.\r\nWhether it was on account of Mr Hope\'s return to the house, she could\r\nnot satisfy herself.  She had sat, conscious and inwardly distressed, at\r\nthe tea-table, where nothing remarkable had occurred; and was glad to\r\nescape from the circle where all that was said appeared to her excited\r\nspirit to be tiresome, or trifling, or vexatious.\r\n\r\nHow different was it all when she returned to the house!  How she loved\r\nthe whole world, and no one in it was dull, and nothing was trifling,\r\nand it was out of the power of circumstances to vex her!  Life had\r\nbecome heaven: its doubts, its cares, its troubles, were gone, and all\r\nhad given place to a soul-penetrating joy.  She should grow perfect now,\r\nfor she had one whom she believed perfect to lead her on.  Her pride,\r\nher jealousy, would trouble her no more: it was for want of sympathy--\r\nperfect sympathy always at hand--that she had been a prey to them.  She\r\nshould pine no more, for there was one who was her own.  A calm,\r\nnameless, all-pervading bliss had wrapped itself round her spirit, and\r\nbrought her as near to her Maker as if she had been his favoured child.\r\nThere needs no other proof that happiness is the most wholesome moral\r\natmosphere, and that in which the immortality of man is destined\r\nultimately to thrive, than the elevation of soul, the religious\r\naspiration, which attends the first assurance, the first sober\r\ncertainty, of true love.  There is much of this religious aspiration\r\namidst all warmth of virtuous affections.  There is a vivid love of God\r\nin the child that lays its cheek against the cheek of its mother, and\r\nclasps its arms about her neck.  God is thanked (perhaps unconsciously)\r\nfor the brightness of his earth, on summer evenings, when a brother and\r\nsister, who have long been parted, pour out their heart stores to each\r\nother, and feel their course of thought brightening as it runs.  When\r\nthe aged parent hears of the honours his children have won, or looks\r\nround upon their innocent faces as the glory of his decline, his mind\r\nreverts to Him who in them prescribed the purpose of his life, and\r\nbestowed its grace.  But, religious as is the mood of every good\r\naffection, none is so devotional as that of love, especially so called.\r\nThe soul is then the very temple of adoration, of faith, of holy purity,\r\nof heroism, of charity.  At such a moment the human creature shoots up\r\ninto the angel: there is nothing on earth too defiled for its charity--\r\nnothing in hell too appalling for its heroism--nothing in heaven too\r\nglorious for its sympathy.  Strengthened, sustained, vivified by that\r\nmost mysterious power, union with another spirit, it feels itself set\r\nwell forth on the way of victory over evil, sent out conquering and to\r\nconquer.  There is no other such crisis in human life.  The philosopher\r\nmay experience uncontrollable agitation in verifying his principle of\r\nbalancing systems of worlds, feeling, perhaps, as if he actually saw the\r\ncreative hand in the act of sending the planets forth on their\r\neverlasting way; but this philosopher, solitary seraph, as he may be\r\nregarded, amidst a myriad of men, knows at such a moment no emotions so\r\ndivine as those of the spirit becoming conscious that it is beloved--be\r\nit the peasant girl in the meadow, or the daughter of the sage, reposing\r\nin her father\'s confidence, or the artisan beside his loom, or the man\r\nof letters musing by his fireside.  The warrior, about to strike the\r\ndecisive blow for the liberties of a nation, however impressed with the\r\nsolemnity of the hour, is not in a state of such lofty resolution as\r\nthose who, by joining hearts, are laying their joint hands on the whole\r\nwide realm of futurity for their own.  The statesman who, in the moment\r\nof success, feels that an entire class of social sins and woes is\r\nannihilated by his hand, is not conscious of so holy and so intimate a\r\nthankfulness as they who are aware that their redemption is come in the\r\npresence of a new and sovereign affection.  And these are many--they are\r\nin all corners of every land.  The statesman is the leader of a nation--\r\nthe warrior is the grace of an age--the philosopher is the birth of a\r\nthousand years; but the lover--where is he not?  Wherever parents look\r\nround upon their children, there he has been--wherever children are at\r\nplay together, there he will soon be--wherever there are roofs under\r\nwhich men dwell--wherever there is an atmosphere vibrating with human\r\nvoices, there is the lover, and there is his lofty worship going on,\r\nunspeakable, but revealed in the brightness of the eye, the majesty of\r\nthe presence, and the high temper of the discourse.  Men have been\r\nungrateful and perverse; they have done what they could to counteract,\r\nto debase, this most heavenly influence of their life; but the laws of\r\ntheir Maker are too strong, the benignity of their Father is too patient\r\nand fervent, for their opposition to withstand: and true love continues,\r\nand will continue, to send up its homage amidst the meditations of every\r\neventide, and the busy hum of noon, and the song of the morning stars.\r\n\r\nHester, when she re-entered the house, was full of the commonest feeling\r\nof all in happy lovers,--a wonder that such intense happiness should be\r\npermitted to her.  Margaret was lingering about the stair-head in the\r\ndusk, and met her sister at the door of their own apartment.\r\n\r\n"May I come in?" said she.\r\n\r\n"May you come in?  Oh, Margaret!  I want you."\r\n\r\n"All is right: all is well; is it, Hester?  And I was quite wrong\r\nthroughout.  I grieve now that I helped to make you miserable: but,\r\nindeed, I was miserable myself.  I saw no hope; I was completely\r\nmistaken."\r\n\r\n"We were both mistaken," said Hester, resting her head at Margaret\'s\r\nshoulder.  "Mistaken in judgment,--blinded by anxiety.  But all that is\r\nover now.  Margaret, what have I done that I should be so happy?"\r\n\r\n"You have loved one who deserves such a love as yours," said Margaret,\r\nsmiling.  "That is what you have done: and you will have the blessings\r\nof all who know you both.  You have mine, dearest."\r\n\r\n"What an ungrateful wretch shall I be, if I do not make every one happy\r\nthat is within my reach!" cried Hester.  "Margaret, I will never grieve\r\nhis heart as I have grieved yours.  I will never grieve yours again."\r\n\r\n"But how is it?" asked Margaret.  "You have not told me yet.  Is it all\r\nsettled?"\r\n\r\nA silent embrace told that it was.\r\n\r\n"I may shake hands with you upon it, then.  Oh, Hester, after all our\r\nlongings for a brother, you are going to give me one!  We are not alone\r\nin the world.  My father,--our mother,--where are they?  Do they know?\r\nHave they foreseen while we have been suffering so?  Do they now foresee\r\nfor us?"\r\n\r\n"There was not one word of his," said Hester, "that I should not have\r\ngloried in their hearing.  So gentle, Margaret! so noble! so calm!"\r\n\r\n"And you?" said Margaret, softly.  "Did you speak--speak openly?"\r\n\r\n"Yes: it was no time for pride.  With him I have no pride.  I could not\r\nhave believed how I should tell him all: but he was so noble,--spoke so\r\ngloriously,--that it would have been an insult to use any disguise.  He\r\nknows all that you know, Margaret,--and I am not ashamed."\r\n\r\n"I honour you," said Margaret.  "Thank God, all is right!  But where is\r\nMr Hope all this time?"\r\n\r\n"He went away when I came in.  You will see him in the morning."\r\n\r\n"Can you go down this evening?  If you think you can--."\r\n\r\n"Go down!  Yes:--this moment.  I feel as if I could face the whole\r\nworld."\r\n\r\n"Let me ask one thing.  May I tell Maria in the morning?  She will be so\r\npleased! and no one but you understands my feelings so well.  Everybody\r\nwill rejoice with me; but I can say anything to her.  May I tell her all\r\nin the morning?"\r\n\r\n"Dear Maria!  Oh, yes: tell her from me, with my love.  I know I shall\r\nhave her blessing.  Now let us go down."\r\n\r\n"But we must just settle how matters are to proceed," said Margaret.\r\n"Are the family to know or not?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, let all that take its chance!" said Hester.  "I am sure I do not\r\ncare.  Let it be as it happens, for to-night at least."\r\n\r\n"For to-night at least," agreed Margaret.\r\n\r\nAll was going on as usual below-stairs.  The working of collars and of\r\nrugs was proceeding, as the family sat round the lamp.  On the\r\nappearance of Hester and Margaret, the book, with the Society\'s cover on\r\nit, was produced; and it was requested that some one would read aloud,\r\nas it was necessary that forty pages a day should be gone through, to\r\nget the volume done by the time it must be sent to Mrs Enderby.  Sophia\r\nasked whether some one else would be so good as to read this evening, as\r\nshe thought she could finish her collar by keeping steadily to it till\r\nbedtime.\r\n\r\nMargaret took the book, and was surprised to find how easy a process it\r\nis to read aloud passably without taking in a word of the sense.\r\nFortunately the Greys were not much given, to make remarks on what they\r\nread.  To have gone through the books that came from the Society was\r\nenough; and they could not have accomplished the forty pages an evening\r\nif they had stopped to talk.  The only words spoken during the lecture,\r\ntherefore, were occasional remarks that the reader seemed hoarse, and\r\nthat some one else had better take the book; and whispered requests\r\nacross the table for scissors, thread, or the adjustment of the light.\r\nSuch being the method of literary exercise in the family, Hester and\r\nMargaret were able to think of anything they pleased with impunity.\r\n\r\n"There! here comes papa!" said Sophia; "and I do not believe we have\r\nread nearly forty pages.  Where did you begin, Margaret?"\r\n\r\nMargaret resigned the volume to her to have the place found, and was\r\ntold that she should not have shifted the marker till the evening\r\nreading was done, unless she at once set it forward forty pages: it made\r\nit so difficult to find the place.  Sophia was detained only five\r\nminutes from her collar, however, before she discovered that they had\r\nread only eight-and-twenty pages.  Mrs Grey observed that Mr Grey was\r\ncoming in rather earlier than usual to-night; and Sophia added, that her\r\ncousins had been a good while in their own room.\r\n\r\nHester was conscious that Mr Grey cast a rapid, penetrating glance upon\r\nher as he drew his chair, and took his seat at her elbow.\r\n\r\n"What a clever book this is!" said Mrs Grey.\r\n\r\n"Very entertaining," added Sophia.\r\n\r\n"What is your opinion of it?" asked Mr Grey of Hester.\r\n\r\nShe smiled, and said she must read more of it before she could judge.\r\n\r\n"It is such a relief," said Mrs Grey, "to have a book like this in hand\r\nafter the tiresome things Mr Rowland orders in!  He consults Mrs\r\nRowland\'s notions about books far too much; and she always takes a fancy\r\nto the dullest.  One would almost think it was on purpose."\r\n\r\nSydney liked the sport of knocking on the head charges against the\r\nRowlands.  He showed, by a reference to the Society\'s list, that the\r\nbook just laid down was ordered by the Rowlands.\r\n\r\n"Dear me!  Sophia," said her mother, "you made quite a mistake.  You\r\ntold us it was ordered in by Mr Hope.  I am sure, I thought so all this\r\ntime."\r\n\r\n"Well, I dare say we shall not be able to finish it," said Sophia.  "We\r\nhave read only eight-and-twenty pages this evening.  Papa! how\r\nshockingly Mr Hope looks still, does not he?  I think he looks worse\r\nthan when he was here last."\r\n\r\n"And I trust he will look better when we see him next.  I have the\r\nstrongest hopes that he will now gain ground every day."\r\n\r\n"I am sure he seems to have gained very little yet."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, he has; as I trust you will soon see."\r\n\r\nSophia was about to bewail Mr Hope\'s sickly looks again, when her\r\nmother trod on her foot under the table; and, moreover, winked and\r\nfrowned in a very awful way, so that Sophia felt silenced, she could not\r\nconceive for what reason.  Not being able to think of anything else to\r\nsay, to cover her confusion, she discovered that it was bedtime,--at\r\nleast for people who had been gathering apples.\r\n\r\nOnce more Mrs Grey gazed over her spectacles at her husband, when the\r\nyoung people were gone.\r\n\r\n"My dear," said she, "what makes you think that Mr Hope is gaining\r\nground every day?"\r\n\r\n"My dear, what made you tread on all our toes when I said so?"\r\n\r\n"Dear me, I only gave Sophia a hint, to prevent her saying dismal things\r\nbefore people.  One does not know what may be passing in their minds,\r\nyou know."\r\n\r\n"And so you kindly show what is passing in yours.  However, these young\r\nladies may soon be able, perhaps, to tell us more about Hope than we can\r\ntell them."\r\n\r\n"My dear, what do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"I saw a glance between them, a smile, when you were silencing Sophia.\r\nI believe you may prepare yourself for some news, my dear."\r\n\r\n"I have no doubt of Hester\'s state of mind--"\r\n\r\n"And I feel confident of Hope\'s; so here is the case, pretty well made\r\nout between us."\r\n\r\nMrs Grey was in raptures for a moment; but she then resumed her system\r\nof mysterious tokens.  She shook her head, and owned that she had reason\r\nto think her husband was mistaken.\r\n\r\n"Well, just observe them the next time they are together; that is all."\r\n\r\n"And my poor Hester looks wretchedly, Mr Grey.  It really makes my\r\nheart ache to see her."\r\n\r\n"How differently people view things!  I was just thinking that I never\r\nsaw her so lovely, with such a sprightliness, such a glow in her face,\r\nas five minutes ago."\r\n\r\n"Just this evening, she does not look so pale; but she is sadly\r\naltered--grievously changed indeed.  Seeing this, is the only thing\r\nwhich reconciles me to parting with her.  Now, Mr Grey, I should like\r\nto know what sets you smiling in that manner at the poor girl."\r\n\r\n"I was smiling to think how, as young ladies have been known to change\r\ntheir minds, it may be possible that we may have the pleasure of seeing\r\nHester pick up her good looks again here, in spite of all that Morris\r\nsays about her native air.  I should not wonder that we may persuade her\r\nto stay yet."\r\n\r\nMrs Grey shook her head decisively.  She should have been very glad, a\r\nlittle while since, to hear her husband\'s opinion that Mr Hope\'s views\r\nwere fixed upon Hester; but now--.  But men were always so positive; and\r\nalways the most positive where they knew the least!  A deep sigh from\r\nthe one party, and a broad smile from the other, closed the\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTEEN.\r\n\r\nSOPHIA IN THE VILLAGE.\r\n\r\nDeerbrook was not a place where practical affairs could be long kept\r\nsecret, even where the best reasons for secrecy existed.  About Hester\'s\r\nengagement there was no reason whatever for concealment; and it was\r\naccordingly made known to every one in Deerbrook in the course of the\r\nnext day.--Margaret shut herself up with Maria before breakfast, and\r\nenjoyed an hour of hearty sympathy from her, in the first place.  As\r\nthey were both aware that this communication was a little out of\r\norder,--Mr and Mrs Grey having a clear title to the earliest\r\ninformation,--Maria had to be discreet for nearly three hours--till she\r\nheard the news from another quarter.\r\n\r\nImmediately after breakfast, Mr Hope called on Mr Grey at the office,\r\nand informed him.  Mr Grey stepped home, and found Margaret\r\nenlightening his wife.  Sophia was next called in, while Morris was\r\ncloseted with her young ladies.  Sophia burst breathless into the\r\nsummer-house to tell Miss Young, which she did in whispers so loud as to\r\nbe overheard by the children.  Matilda immediately found she had left\r\nher slate-pencil behind her, and ran into the house to give her mamma\r\nthe news, just at the moment that Mr Grey was relating it to his\r\npartner in the office.  On returning, Sophia found her mother putting on\r\nher bonnet, having remembered that it was quite time she should be\r\nstepping across the way to hear how poor Mrs Enderby was, after the\r\nthunder-storm of three days ago.  This reminded Sophia that she ought to\r\nbe inquiring about the worsteds which Mrs Howell must have got down\r\nfrom London by this time, to finish Mrs Grey\'s rug.  Mrs Grey could\r\nnot trust her eyes to match shades of worsteds; and Sophia now set out\r\nwith great alacrity to oblige her mother by doing it for her.  On the\r\nway she met Dr Levitt, about to enter the house of a sick parishioner.\r\nDr Levitt hoped all at home were well.  All very well, indeed, Sophia\r\nwas obliged to him.  Her only fear was that the excitement of present\r\ncircumstances might be too much for mamma.  Mamma was so very much\r\nattached to cousin Hester, and it would be such a delightful thing to\r\nhave her settled beside them!  Perhaps Dr Levitt had not heard that\r\nHester and Mr Hope were going to be married.  No, indeed, he had not.\r\nHe wondered his friend Hope had not told him of his good fortune, of\r\nwhich he heartily wished him joy.  How long had this happy affair been\r\nsettled?  Not long, he fancied?  Not very long; and perhaps Mr Hope did\r\nnot consider that it was quite made public yet: but Sophia thought that\r\nDr Levitt ought to know.  Dr Levitt thanked her, and said he would try\r\nand find Hope in the course of the morning, to congratulate him; and he\r\nand Mrs Levitt would give themselves the pleasure of calling on the\r\nladies, very shortly.\r\n\r\n"Ritson, how is your wife?" said Sophia, crossing over to speak to a\r\nlabourer who was on his way up the street.\r\n\r\n"A deal better, Miss.  She\'s coming about right nicely!"\r\n\r\n"Ah! that is Mr Hope\'s doing.  He attends her, of course."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, Miss; he\'s done her a sight o\' good."\r\n\r\n"Ah! so he always does: but Ritson, if he should not be able to attend\r\nto her quite so closely as usual, just now, you will excuse it, when you\r\nhear how it is."\r\n\r\n"Lord, Miss! the wonder is that he has come at all, so ill as he has\r\nbeen hisself."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t mean that: you will soon see him very well now.  He is going to\r\nbe married, Ritson--"\r\n\r\n"What, is he?  Well--"\r\n\r\n"To my cousin, Miss Ibbotson.  He will be more at our house, you know,\r\nthan anywhere else."  And with a wink which was a very good miniature of\r\nher mother\'s Sophia passed on, leaving Ritson to bless Mr Hope and the\r\npretty young lady.\r\n\r\nShe cast a glance into the butcher\'s shop as she arrived opposite to it;\r\nand her heart leaped up when she saw Mrs James, the lawyer\'s wife,\r\nwatching the weighing of a loin of veal.\r\n\r\n"You will excuse my interrupting you, Mrs James," said she, from the\r\nthreshold of the shop: "but we are anxious to know whether Mr James\r\nthinks Mrs Enderby really altered of late.  We saw him go in last week,\r\nand we heard it was to make an alteration in her will."\r\n\r\n"I often wonder how things get abroad," said Mrs James, "My husband\r\nmakes such a particular point of never speaking of such affairs; and I\r\nam sure no one ever hears them from me."\r\n\r\n"I believe Mrs Enderby told mamma that about the will herself."\r\n\r\n"Well, that is as she pleases, of course," said Mrs James, smiling.\r\n"What is the weight with the kidney, Mr Jones?"\r\n\r\n"We should like so to know," resumed Sophia, "whether Mr James\r\nconsiders Mrs Enderby much altered of late."\r\n\r\n"I should think you would be better able to judge than he, Miss Grey; I\r\nbelieve you see her ten times to his once."\r\n\r\n"That is the very reason: we see her so often, that a gradual change\r\nwould be less likely to strike us."\r\n\r\n"Mr Hope will give you satisfaction: he must be a better judge than any\r\nof us."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes; but we cannot expect him to have eyes for any person but one,\r\nat present, you know."\r\n\r\n"Oh, so he is going to marry Deborah Giles, after all?"\r\n\r\n"Deborah Giles!"\r\n\r\n"Yes; was he not said to be engaged to her, some time ago?"\r\n\r\n"Deborah Giles! the boatman\'s daughter!  I declare I never heard of such\r\na place as this for gossip!  Why, Deborah Giles can barely read and\r\nwrite; and she is beneath Mr Hope in every way.  I do not believe he\r\never spoke to her in his life."\r\n\r\n"Oh, well; I do not pretend to know.  I heard something about it.\r\nEleven and threepence.  Can you change a sovereign, Mr Jones?  And,\r\npray, send home the chops immediately."\r\n\r\n"It is my cousin, Miss Ibbotson, that Mr Hope is engaged to," said\r\nSophia, unable to refrain from disclosures which she yet saw were not\r\ncared for:--"the beautiful Miss Ibbotson, you know."\r\n\r\n"Indeed: I am sure somebody said it was Deborah Giles.  Then you think,\r\nMr Jones, we may depend upon you for game when the season begins?"\r\n\r\nMr Jones seemed more interested in the news than his customer; he\r\nwished Mr Hope all good luck with his pretty lady.\r\n\r\nSophia thought herself fortunate when she saw Mr Enderby turn out of\r\nthe toy-shop with his youngest nephew, a round-faced boy, still in\r\npetticoats, perched upon his shoulder.  Mr Enderby bowed, but did not\r\nseem to heed her call: he jumped through the turnstile, and proceeded to\r\ncanter along the church lane amidst the glee of the child so rapidly,\r\nthat Sophia was obliged to give up the hope of being the first to tell\r\nhim the news.  It was very provoking: she should have liked to see how\r\nhe would look.\r\n\r\nShe was sure of a delighted listener in Mrs Howell, to whom no\r\ncommunication ever came amiss: but there was a condition to Mrs\r\nHowell\'s listening--that she should be allowed to tell her own news\r\nfirst.  When she found that Sophia wanted to match some worsteds, she\r\nand her shop-woman exchanged sympathetic glances--Mrs Howell sighing,\r\nwith her head on the right side, and Miss Miskin groaning, with her head\r\non the left side.\r\n\r\n"Are you ill, Mrs Howell?" asked Sophia.\r\n\r\n"It shook me a little, I confess, ma\'am, hearing that you wanted\r\nworsteds.  We have no relief, ma\'am, from ladies wanting worsteds."\r\n\r\n"No relief, day or night," added Miss Miskin.\r\n\r\n"Day or night!  Surely you do not sell worsteds in the night-time?" said\r\nSophia.\r\n\r\n"Not sell them, ma\'am; only match them.  The matching them is the trial,\r\nI assure you.  If you could only hear my agent, ma\'am--the things he has\r\nto tell about people in my situation--how they are going mad, all over\r\nthe country, with incessantly matching of worsteds, now that that kind\r\nof work is all the fashion.  And nothing more likely, ma\'am, for there\r\nis no getting one\'s natural rest.  I am for ever matching of worsteds in\r\nmy dreams; and when I wake, I seem to have had no rest: and, as you see,\r\ndirectly after breakfast, ladies come for worsteds."\r\n\r\n"And Miss Anderson\'s messenger left a whole bundle of skeins to be\r\nmatched for her young ladies, as early as eight this morning," declared\r\nMiss Miskin: "and so we go on."\r\n\r\n"It will not be for long, I dare say, Mrs Howell.  It is a fashionable\r\nkind of work, that we may soon grow tired of."\r\n\r\n"Dear me, ma\'am, think how long former generations went on with it!\r\nThink of our grandmothers\' work, ma\'am, and how we are treading in their\r\nsteps.  We have the beautifulest patterns now, I assure you.  Miss\r\nMiskin will confirm that we sold one, last week, the very day we had\r\nit--the interior of Abbotsford, with Sir Walter, and the furniture, and\r\nthe dogs, just like life, I assure you."\r\n\r\n"That was beautiful," said Miss Miskin, "but not to compare--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear, no! not to compare, Miss Grey, with one that we were just\r\nallowed the sight of--not a mere pattern, but a finished specimen--and I\r\nnever saw anything so pathetic.--I declare I was quite affected, and so\r\nwas Miss Miskin.  It was `By the Rivers of Babylon,\' most sweetly done!\r\nThere were the harps all in cross-stitch, ma\'am, and the willows all in\r\ntent-stitch--I never saw anything so touching."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think mamma will trouble you for many more worsteds for some\r\ntime to come, Mrs Howell.  When there is going to be a wedding in the\r\nfamily, there is not much time for fancy-work, you know."\r\n\r\n"Dear me, a wedding!" smiled Mrs Howell.\r\n\r\n"A wedding!  Only think!" simpered Miss Miskin.\r\n\r\n"Yes: Mr Hope and my cousin Hester are going to be married.  I am sure\r\nthey will have your best wishes, Mrs Howell?"\r\n\r\n"That they will, ma\'am, as I shall make a point of telling Mr Hope.\r\nBut Miss Grey, I should think it probable that your mamma may think of\r\nworking a drawing-room screen, or perhaps a set of rugs, for the young\r\nfolks; and I assure you, she will see no such patterns anywhere as my\r\nagent sends down to me; as I have no doubt you will tell her.  And pray,\r\nma\'am, where are Mr Hope and his lady to live?  I hope they have\r\npleased their fancy with a house?"\r\n\r\n"That point is not settled yet.  It is a thing which requires some\r\nconsideration, you know."\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear, ma\'am! to be sure it does: but I did not mean to be\r\nimpertinent in asking, I am sure.  Only you mentioned making\r\nwedding-clothes, Miss Grey."\r\n\r\n"I did not mean that we have exactly set about all that yet.  I was only\r\nlooking forward to it."\r\n\r\n"And very right too, ma\'am.  My poor dear Howell used to say so to me,\r\nevery time he found so much difficulty in inducing me to listen to\r\nfuture projects--about the happy day, you know, ma\'am.  He was always\r\nfor looking forward upon principle, dear soul! as you say, ma\'am.  That\r\nis the very brown, ma\'am--no doubt of it.  Only two skeins, ma\'am?"\r\n\r\nHere ended Sophia\'s pleasures in this kind.  She could not summon\r\ncourage to face Mrs Plumstead, without knowing what was the mood of the\r\nday; and the half-door of the little stationery shop was closed, and no\r\nface was visible within.  All her father\'s household, and all whom she\r\nhad told, were as busy as herself; so that by the time she walked down\r\nthe street again, nobody remained to be informed.  She could only go\r\nhome, put off her bonnet, and sit with her mother, watching who would\r\ncall, and planning the external arrangements which constitute the whole\r\ninterest of a wedding to narrow minds and apathetic hearts.\r\n\r\nNo one in Deerbrook enjoyed the news more than Mr Enderby.  When he\r\nevaded Sophia in the street, he little knew what pleasure she had it in\r\nher power to afford him.  It was only deferred for a few minutes,\r\nhowever; for, on his returning his little nephew to mamma\'s side, he\r\nfound his mother and sister talking the matter over.  Mrs Grey\'s visit\r\nto Mrs Enderby had been unusually short, as she could not, on so busy a\r\nday, spare much time to one person.  The moment she was gone, the old\r\nlady rang for her calash and shawl, and prepared to cross the way,\r\ntelling the news meanwhile to her maid Phoebe.  It was a disappointment\r\nto find Mrs Rowland already informed: but then came Philip, ignorant\r\nand unconscious as could be desired.\r\n\r\nThe extreme graciousness of his sister guided him in his guess when he\r\nwas desired to say who was going to be married; but there was a\r\ntrembling heart beneath his light speech.  It was more difficult to\r\ndisguise his joy when he heard the truth.  He carried it off by romping\r\nwith the child, who owed several rides from corner to corner of the room\r\nto the fact that Mr Hope was going to be married to Hester.\r\n\r\n"I am delighted to see Philip take it in this way," observed Mrs\r\nRowland.\r\n\r\n"I was just thinking the same thing," cried Mrs Enderby; "but I believe\r\nI should not have said so if you had not.  I was afraid it might be a\r\nsad disappointment to poor Philip; and this prevented my saying quite so\r\nmuch as I should have done to Mrs Grey.  Now I find it is all right, I\r\nshall just call in, and express myself more warmly on my way home."\r\n\r\n"I beg Philip\'s pardon, I am sure," said Mrs Rowland, "for supposing\r\nfor a moment that he would think of marrying into the Grey connexion.  I\r\ndid him great injustice, I own."\r\n\r\n"By no means," said Philip.  "Because I did not happen to wish to marry\r\nMiss Ibbotson, it does not follow that I should have been wrong if I\r\nhad.  It was feeling this, and a sense of justice to her and myself,\r\nwhich made me refuse to answer your questions, some weeks ago, or to\r\nmake any promises."\r\n\r\n"Well, well: let us keep clear of Mrs Grey\'s connexions, and then you\r\nmay talk of them as you please," said the sister, in the complaisance of\r\nthe hour.\r\n\r\nPhilip remembered his pledge to himself to uphold Mrs Grey as long as\r\nhe lived, if she should prove right about Mr Hope and Hester.  He began\r\nimmediately to discharge his obligations to her, avowing that he did not\r\nsee why her connexion was not as good as his own; that Mrs Grey had\r\nmany excellent points; that she was a woman of a good deal of sagacity;\r\nthat she had shown herself capable of strong family attachments; that\r\nshe had been gracious and kind to himself of late in a degree which he\r\nfelt he had not deserved; and that he considered that all his family\r\nwere obliged to her for her neighbourly attentions to his mother.  Mrs\r\nEnderby seized the occasion of her son\'s support to say some kind thing\r\nof the Greys.  It gave her frequent pain to hear them spoken of after\r\nMrs Rowland\'s usual fashion; but when she was alone with her daughter,\r\nshe dared not object.  Under cover of Mr Rowland\'s presence\r\noccasionally, and to-day of Philip\'s, she ventured to say that she\r\nthought the Greys a very fine family, and kind neighbours to her.\r\n\r\n"And much looked up to in Deerbrook," added Philip.\r\n\r\n"And a great blessing to their poor neighbours," said his mother.\r\n\r\n"Dr Levitt respects them for their conscientious dissent," observed\r\nPhilip.\r\n\r\n"And Mr Hope, who knows them best, says they are a very united family\r\namong themselves," declared Mrs Enderby.\r\n\r\nMrs Rowland looked from one to the other as each spoke, and asked\r\nwhether they were both out of their senses.\r\n\r\n"By no means," said Philip; "I never was more in earnest in my life."\r\n\r\n"I have always thought just what I now say," protested Mrs Enderby.\r\n\r\n"Yes, my dear ma\'am," said the daughter, scornfully, "we are all aware\r\nof your ways of thinking on some points--of your--"\r\n\r\n"Of my mother\'s love of justice and neighbourly temper," said Philip,\r\ngiving his little nephew a glorious somerset from his shoulder.  "I\r\nbelieve, if we could find my mother\'s match, the two would be an\r\nexcellent pair to put into Eddystone lighthouse.  They would chat away\r\nfor a twelvemonth together without ever quarrelling."\r\n\r\n"Philip, do let that poor boy alone," said mamma.  "You are shaking him\r\nto pieces."\r\n\r\n"We have both had enough for the present, eh, Ned?  Mother, I am at your\r\nservice, if you are going to call at the Greys."\r\n\r\nMrs Enderby rose with great alacrity.\r\n\r\n"Come to me, my pet," cried mamma.  "Poor Ned shall rest his head in\r\nmamma\'s lap.  There, there, my pet!"\r\n\r\nMamma\'s pet was not the most agreeable companion to her when they were\r\nleft alone: he was crying lustily after uncle Philip, for all mamma\r\ncould say about uncle Philip always tiring him to death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOURTEEN.\r\n\r\nPREPARING FOR HOME.\r\n\r\nThe affair proceeded rapidly, as such affairs should do where there is\r\nno reason for delay.  There was no more talk of Birmingham.  The journey\r\nwhich was to have been taken in a few days was not spoken of again.  The\r\nexternal arrangements advanced well, so many as there were anxious about\r\nthis part of the matter, and accomplished in habits of business.  Mr\r\nRowland was happy to let the corner-house to Mr Hope, not even taking\r\nadvantage, as his lady advised, of its being peculiarly fit for a\r\nsurgeon\'s residence, from its having a door round the corner (made to be\r\na surgery-door!), to raise the rent.  Mr Rowland behaved handsomely\r\nabout everything, rent, alterations, painting, and papering, and laying\r\nout the garden anew.  Mr Grey bestirred himself to get the affairs at\r\nBirmingham settled; and he was soon enabled to inform Mr Hope that\r\nHester\'s fortune was ascertained, and that it was smaller than could\r\nhave been wished.  He believed his cousins would have seventy pounds\r\na-year each, and no more.  It was some compensation for the mortifying\r\nnature of this announcement, that Mr Hope evidently did not care at all\r\nabout the matter.  He was not an ambitious, nor yet a luxurious man: his\r\npractice supplied an income sufficient for the ease of young married\r\npeople, and it was on the increase.\r\n\r\nNo one seemed to doubt for a moment that Margaret would live with her\r\nsister.  There was no other home for her; she and Hester had never been\r\nparted; there seemed no reason for their parting now, and every\r\ninducement for their remaining together.  Margaret did not dream of\r\nobjecting to this: she only made it a condition that fifty pounds of her\r\nyearly income should go into the family-stock, thus saving her from\r\nobligation to any one for her maintenance.  Living was so cheap in\r\nDeerbrook, that Margaret was assured that she would render herself quite\r\nindependent by paying fifty pounds a-year for her share of the household\r\nexpenses, and reserving twenty for her personal wants.\r\n\r\nBoth the sisters were surprised to find how much pleasure they took in\r\nthe preparations for this marriage.  They could not have believed it,\r\nand, but that they were too happy to feel any kind of contempt, they\r\nwould have despised themselves for it.  But such contempt would have\r\nbeen misplaced.  All things are according to the ideas and feelings with\r\nwhich they are connected; and if, as old George Herbert says, dusting a\r\nroom is an act of religious grace when it is done from a feeling of\r\nreligious duty, furnishing a house is a process of high enjoyment when\r\nit is the preparation of a home for happy love.  The dwelling is hung\r\nall round with bright anticipations, and crowded with blissful thoughts,\r\nspoken by none, perhaps, but present to all.  On this table, and by this\r\nsnug fireside, will the cheerful winter breakfast go forward, when each\r\nis about to enter on the gladsome business of the day; and that sofa\r\nwill be drawn out, and those window-curtains will be closed, when the\r\nintellectual pleasures of the evening--the rewards of the laborious\r\nday--begin.  Those ground-windows will stand open all the summer noon,\r\nand the flower stands will be gay and fragrant; and the shaded parlour\r\nwill be the cool retreat of the wearied husband, when he comes in to\r\nrest from his professional toils.  There will stand the books destined\r\nto refresh and refine his higher tastes; and there the music with which\r\nthe wife will indulge him.  Here will they first feel what it is to have\r\na home of their own--where they will first enjoy the privacy of it, the\r\nsecurity, the freedom, the consequence in the eyes of others, the\r\nsacredness in their own.  Here they will first exercise the graces of\r\nhospitality, and the responsibility of control.  Here will they feel\r\nthat they have attained the great resting-place of their life--the\r\nresting-place of their individual lot, but only the starting-point of\r\ntheir activity.  Such is the work of furnishing a house once in a\r\nlifetime.  It may be a welcome task to the fine lady, decking her\r\ndrawing-room anew, to gratify her ambition, or divert her _ennui_--it\r\nmay be a satisfactory labour to the elderly couple, settling themselves\r\nafresh when their children are dispersed abroad, and it becomes\r\nnecessary to discard the furniture that the boys have battered and\r\nspoiled--it may be a refined amusement to the selfish man of taste,\r\nwishing to prolong or recall the pleasures of foreign travel; but to\r\nnone is it the conscious delight that it is to young lovers and their\r\nsympathising friends, whether the scene be the two rooms of the hopeful\r\nyoung artisan, about to bring home his bride from service; or the palace\r\nof a nobleman, enriched with intellectual luxuries for the lady of his\r\nadoration; or the quiet abode of an unambitious professional man, whose\r\naim is privacy and comfort.\r\n\r\nMargaret\'s delight in the process of preparation was the most intense of\r\nall that was felt, except perhaps by one person.  Mrs Grey and Sophia\r\nenjoyed the bustle, and the consequence, and the exercise of their\r\nfeminine talents, and the gossip of the village, and the spitefulness of\r\nMrs Rowland\'s criticisms, when she had recovered from her delight at\r\nher brother\'s escape from Hester, and had leisure to be offended at Mr\r\nHope\'s marrying into the Grey connexion so decidedly.  The children\r\nrelished the mystery of buying their presents secretly, and hiding them\r\nfrom their cousins, till the day before the wedding.  Sydney was proud\r\nto help Margaret in training the chrysanthemums, putting the garden into\r\nwinter trim, and in planting round the walls of the surgery with large\r\nevergreens.  Mr Grey came down almost every evening to suggest and\r\napprove; and Morris left her needle (now busy from morning till night in\r\nHester\'s service) to admire, and to speak her wishes, when desired,\r\nabout the preparations in her department.  Morris, another maid, and a\r\nfoot-boy, were the only servants; and Morris was to have everything as\r\nshe liked best for her own region.  But Margaret was as eager and\r\ninterested as all the rest together.  Her heart was light for her\r\nsister; and for the first time since she was capable of thought, she\r\nbelieved that Hester was going to be happy.  Her own gain was almost too\r\ngreat for gratitude: a home, a brother, and relief from the\r\nresponsibility of her sister\'s peace--as often as she thought of these\r\nblessings, she looked almost as bright as Hester herself.\r\n\r\nHow was Mr Hope, all this while?  Well, and growing happier every day.\r\nHe believed himself a perfectly happy man, and looked back with wonder\r\nto the struggle which it had cost him to accept his present lot.  He was\r\nnot only entirely recovered from his accident before the rich month of\r\nOctober came in, but truly thankful for it as the means of bringing to\r\nhis knowledge, sooner at least, the devoted affection which he had\r\ninspired.  It cannot but be animating, flattering, delightful to a man\r\nof strong domestic tendencies, to know himself the object of the\r\nexclusive attachment of a strong-minded and noble-hearted woman: and\r\nwhen, in addition to this, her society affords the delight of mental\r\naccomplishment and personal beauty, such as Hester\'s, he must be a churl\r\nindeed if he does not greatly enjoy the present, and indulge in sweet\r\nanticipations for the future.  Hope also brought the whole power of his\r\nwill to bear upon his circumstances.  He dwelt upon all the happiest\r\nfeatures of his lot; and, in his admiration of Hester, thought as little\r\nas he could of Margaret.  He had the daily delight of seeing how he\r\nconstituted the new-born happiness of her whose life was to be devoted\r\nto him: he heard of nothing but rejoicings and blessings, and fully\r\nbelieved himself the happy man that every one declared him.  He dwelt on\r\nthe prospect of a home full of domestic attachment, of rational pursuit,\r\nof intellectual resource; and looked forward to a life of religious\r\nusefulness, of vigorous devotedness to others, of which he trusted that\r\nhis first act of self-sacrifice and its consequences were the earnest\r\nand the pledge.  He had never for a moment repented what he had done;\r\nand now, when he hastily recurred to the struggle it had cost him, it\r\nwas chiefly to moralise on the short-sightedness of men in their wishes,\r\nand to be grateful for his own present satisfaction.  A few cold\r\nmisgivings had troubled him, and continued to trouble him, if Hester at\r\nany time looked at all less bright and serene than usual: but he\r\nconcluded that these were merely the cloud-shadows which necessarily\r\nchequer all the sunshine of this world.  He told himself that when two\r\nhuman beings become closely dependent on each other, their peace must\r\nhang upon the variations in one another\'s moods; and that moods must\r\nvary in all mortals.  He persuaded himself that this was a necessary\r\nconsequence of the relation, and to be received as a slight set-off\r\nagainst the unfathomable blessings of sympathy.  He concluded that he\r\nhad deceived himself about his feelings for Margaret: he must have been\r\nmistaken; for he could now receive from her the opening confidence of a\r\nsister; he could cordially agree to the arrangement of her living with\r\nthem; he could co-operate with her in the preparation for the coming\r\ntime, without any emotion which was inconsistent with his duty to\r\nHester.  With unconscious prudence, he merely said this to himself, and\r\nlet it pass, reverting to his beautiful, his happy, his own Hester, and\r\nthe future years over which her image spread its sunshine.  The one\r\nperson who relished the task of preparation more than Margaret herself\r\nwas Hope.  Every advance in the work seemed to bring him nearer to the\r\nsource of the happiness he felt.  Every day of which they marked the\r\nlapse appeared to open wider the portals of that home which he was now\r\nmore than ever habituated to view as the sanctuary of duty, of holiness,\r\nand of peace.  All remarked on Mr Hope\'s altered looks.  The shyness\r\nand coldness with which he had seemed to receive the first\r\ncongratulations on his engagement, and which excited wonder in many, and\r\nuneasiness in a few, had now given place to a gaiety only subdued by a\r\nmore tender happiness.  Even Mrs Grey need no longer watch his\r\ncountenance and manner, and weigh his words with anxiety, and try to\r\nforget that there was a secret between them.\r\n\r\nOne ground of Mr Hope\'s confidence was Hester\'s candour.  She had truly\r\ntold her sister, she felt it was no time for pride when he offered\r\nhimself to her.  Her pride was strong; but there was something in her as\r\nmuch stronger in force than her pride as it was higher in its nature;\r\nand she had owned her love with a frankness which had commanded his\r\nesteem as much as it engaged his generosity.  She had made a no less\r\nopen avowal of her faults to him.  She had acknowledged the\r\nimperfections of her temper (the sorest of her troubles) both at the\r\noutset of their engagement, and often since.  At first, the confession\r\nwas made in an undoubting confidence that she should be reasonable, and\r\namiable, and serene henceforth for ever, while she had him by her side.\r\nSubsequent experience had moderated this confidence into a hope that, by\r\nhis example, and under his guidance, she should be enabled to surmount\r\nher failings.  He shared this hope with her; pledged himself to her and\r\nto himself to forbear as he would be forborne; to aid her, and to honour\r\nher efforts; and he frequently declared, for his own satisfaction and\r\nhers, that all must be safe between them while such generous candour was\r\nthe foundation of their intercourse,--a generosity and candour in whose\r\nnoble presence superficial failings of temper were as nothing.  He\r\nadmitted that her temper was not perfect; and he must ever remember his\r\nown foreknowledge of this: but he must also bear in mind whence this\r\nforeknowledge was derived, and pay everlasting honour to the greatness\r\nof soul to which he owed it.\r\n\r\nAn early day in December was fixed for the marriage, and no cause of\r\ndelay occurred.  There happened to be no patients so dangerously ill as\r\nto prevent Mr Hope\'s absence for his brief wedding trip; the\r\nwork-people were as nearly punctual as could be expected, and the house\r\nwas all but ready.  The wedding was really to take place, therefore,\r\nthough Mrs Rowland gave out that in her opinion the engagement had been\r\na surprisingly short one; that she hoped the young people knew what they\r\nwere about, while all their friends were in such a hurry; that it was a\r\nwretched time of year for a wedding; and that, in her opinion, it would\r\nhave been much pleasanter to wait for fine spring weather.\r\n\r\nAs it happened, the weather was finer than it had been almost any day of\r\nthe preceding spring.  The day before the wedding was sunny and mild as\r\nan October morning, and the fires seemed to be blazing more for show\r\nthan use.  When Mr Hope dropped in at the Greys\', at two o\'clock, he\r\nfound the family dining.  It was a fancy of Mrs Grey\'s to dine early on\r\nwhat she considered busy days.  An early dinner was, with her, a\r\nspecific for the despatch of business.  On this day, the arrangement was\r\nrather absurd; for the great evil of the time was, that everything was\r\ndone, except what could not be transacted till the evening; and the\r\nhours were actually hanging heavy on the hands of some members of the\r\nfamily.  Morris had packed Hester\'s clothes for her little journey, and\r\nput out of sight all the mourning of both sisters, except what they\r\nactually had on.  Sophia\'s dress for the next morning was laid out, in\r\nreadiness to be put on, and the preparations for the breakfast were as\r\ncomplete as they could be twenty hours beforehand.  It only remained to\r\ntake a final view of the house in the evening (when the children\'s\r\npresents were to be discovered), and to cut the wedding-cake.  In the\r\ninterval, there was nothing to be done.  Conversation flagged; every one\r\nwas dull; and it was a relief to the rest when Mr Hope proposed to\r\nHester to take a walk.\r\n\r\nMrs Rowland would have laughed at the idea of a walk on a December\r\nafternoon, if she had happened to know of the circumstance; but others\r\nthan lovers might have considered it pleasant.  The sun was still an\r\nhour from its setting; and high in the pale heaven was the large moon,\r\nready to shine upon the fields and woods, and shed a milder day.  No\r\nfrost had yet bound up the earth; it had only stripped the trees with a\r\ntouch as gentle as that of the fruit-gatherer.  No wintry gusts had yet\r\nswept through the woods; and all there was this day as still as in the\r\nautumn noon, when the nut is heard to drop upon the fallen leaves, and\r\nthe light squirrel is startled at the rustle along its own path.  As a\r\nmatter of course, the lovers took their way to the Spring in the Vernon\r\nwoods, the spot which had witnessed more of their confidence than any\r\nother.  In the alcove above it they had taken shelter from the summer\r\nstorm and the autumn shower; they had sat on its brink for many an hour,\r\nwhen the pure depths of its rocky basin seemed like coolness itself in\r\nthe midst of heat, and when falling leaves fluttered down the wind, and\r\ndimpled the surface of the water.  They now paused once more under\r\nshelter of the rock which overhung one side of the basin, and listened\r\nto the trickle of the spring.  If "aside the devil turned for envy" in\r\nthe presence of the pair in Paradise, it might be thought that he would\r\ntake flight from this scene also; from the view of this resting of the\r\nlovers on their marriage eve, when the last sun of their separate lives\r\nwas sinking, and the separate business of their existence was finished,\r\nand their paths had met before the gate of their paradise, and they were\r\nonly waiting for the portal to open to them.  But there was that on\r\nHester\'s brow which would have made the devil look closer.  She was\r\ndiscomposed, and her replies to what was said were brief, and not much\r\nto the purpose.  After a few moments\' silence, Mr Hope said gaily--\r\n\r\n"There is something on our minds, Hester.  Come, what is it?"\r\n\r\n"Do not say `our minds.\'  You know you never have anything on yours.  I\r\nbelieve it is against your nature; and I know it is against your\r\nprinciples.  Do not say `our minds.\'"\r\n\r\n"I say it because it is true.  I never see you look grave but my heart\r\nis as heavy--.  But never mind that.  What is the matter, love?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing," sighed Hester.  "Nothing that any one can help--.  People may\r\nsay what they will, Edward: but there can be no escape from living alone\r\nin this world, after all."\r\n\r\n"What _do_ you mean?"\r\n\r\n"I mean what no one, not even you, can gainsay.  I mean that `the heart\r\nknoweth its own bitterness;\' that we have disappointments, and\r\nanxieties, and remorse, and many, many kinds of trouble that we can\r\nnever tell to any human being--that none have any concern with--that we\r\nshould never dare to tell.  We must be alone in the world, after all."\r\n\r\n"Where is your faith, while you feel so?" asked Edward, smiling.  "Do\r\nyou really think that confidence proceeds only while people believe each\r\nother perfect,--while they have not anxieties, and disappointments, and\r\nremorse?  Do you not feel that our faults, or rather our failures, bind\r\nus together?"\r\n\r\n"Our faults bind us together!" exclaimed Hester.  "Oh how happy I should\r\nbe, if I could think that!"\r\n\r\n"We cannot but think it.  We shall find it so, love, every day.  When\r\nour faith fails, when we are discouraged, instead of fighting the battle\r\nwith our faithlessness alone, we shall come to one another for courage,\r\nfor stimulus, for help to see the bright, the true side of everything."\r\n\r\n"That supposes that we can do so," said Hester, sadly.  "But I cannot.\r\nI have all my life intended to repose entire confidence, and I have\r\nnever done it yet."\r\n\r\n"Yes: you have in me.  You cannot help it.  You think that you cannot,\r\nonly because you mean more by reposing confidence than others do.  Your\r\nspirit is too noble, too ingenuous, too humble for concealment.  You\r\ncannot help yourself, Hester: you have fully confided in me, and you\r\nwill go on to do so."\r\n\r\nHester shook her head mournfully.  "I have done it hitherto with you,\r\nand with you only," said she: "and the mason has been--you know the\r\nreason--the same which made me own all to you, that first evening in the\r\nshrubbery.  Ah!  I see you think that this is a lasting security; that,\r\nas you will never change, I never shall: but you do not understand me\r\nwholly yet.  There is something that you do not know,--that I cannot\r\nmake you believe: but you will find it true, when it is too late.  No\r\ngood influence is permanent with me; many, all have been tried; and the\r\nevil that is in me gets the better of them all at last."\r\n\r\nShe snatched her hand from her lover\'s, and covered her face to hide her\r\ntears.\r\n\r\n"I shall not contradict you, Hester," said he, tenderly, "because you\r\nwill only abase yourself the more in your own eyes.  But tell me again--\r\nwhere is your faith, while you let spectres from the past glide over\r\ninto the future, to terrify you?  I say `you\' and not `us,\' because I am\r\nnot terrified.  I fear nothing.  I trust you, and I trust Him who\r\nbrought us together, and moved you to lay open your honest heart to me."\r\n\r\n"My sick heart, Edward.  It is sick with fear.  I thought I had got over\r\nit.  I thought you had cured it; and that now, on this day, of all days,\r\nI should have been full of your spirit--of the spirit which made me so\r\nhappy a few weeks ago, that I was sure I should never fall back again.\r\nBut I am disappointed in myself, Edward--wholly disappointed in myself.\r\nI have often been so before, but this time it is fatal.  I shall never\r\nmake you happy, Edward."\r\n\r\n"Neither God nor man requires it of you, Hester.  Dismiss it--."\r\n\r\n"Oh, hear me!" cried Hester, in great agitation.  "I vowed to devote\r\nmyself to my father\'s happiness, when my mother died; I promised to\r\nplace the most absolute confidence in him.  I failed.  I fancied\r\nmiserable things.  I fancied he loved Margaret better; and that I was\r\nnot necessary to him; and I was too proud, too selfish, to tell him so:\r\nand when he was dying, and commended Margaret and me to each other--Oh,\r\nso solemnly!--I am sure it was in compassion to me--and I shrank from\r\nit, even at that moment.  When we came here, and Margaret and I felt\r\nourselves alone among strangers, we promised the same confidence I vowed\r\nto my father.  The next thing was--perhaps you saw it--I grew jealous of\r\nMargaret\'s having another friend, though Maria was as ready to be my\r\nfriend as hers, if I had only been worthy of it.  Up to this hour--at\r\nthis very moment, I believe I am jealous of Maria--and with Margaret\r\nbefore my eyes--Margaret, who loves me as her own soul, and yet has\r\nnever felt one moment\'s jealousy of you, I am certain, if her heart was\r\nknown."\r\n\r\n"We will rejoice, then, in Margaret\'s peace of mind, the reward of her\r\nfaith."\r\n\r\n"Oh, so I do!  I bless God that she is rewarded, better than by me.  But\r\nyou see how it is.  You see how I poison every one\'s life.  I never made\r\nanybody happy!  I never shall make anyone happy!"\r\n\r\n"Let us put the thought of making happiness out of our minds\r\naltogether," said Hope.  "I am persuaded that half the misery in the\r\nworld comes of straining after happiness."\r\n\r\n"After our own," said Hester.  "I could give up my own.  But yours!  I\r\ncannot put yours out of my thoughts."\r\n\r\n"Yes, you can; and you will when you give your faith fair play.  Why\r\ncannot you trust God with my happiness as well as your own?  And why\r\ncannot you trust me to do without happiness, if it be necessary, as well\r\nas yourself?"\r\n\r\n"I know," said Hester, "that you are as willing to forego all for me as\r\nI am for you; but I cannot, I dare not, consent to the risk.  Oh,\r\nEdward! if ever you wished to give me ease, do what I ask now!  Give me\r\nup!  I shall make you wretched.  Give me up, Edward!"\r\n\r\nHope\'s spirit was for one instant wrapped in storm.  He recoiled from\r\nthe future, and at the moment of recoil came this offer of release.  One\r\nmoment\'s thought of freedom, one moment\'s thought of Margaret convulsed\r\nhis soul; but before he could speak the tempest had passed away.\r\nHester\'s face, frightfully agitated, was upraised: his countenance\r\nseemed heavenly to her when he smiled upon her, and replied--\r\n\r\n"I will not.  You are mine; and, as I said before, all our failures, all\r\nour heart-sickness, must bind us the more to each other."\r\n\r\n"Then you must sustain me--you must cure me--you must do what no one has\r\never yet been able to do.  But above all, Edward, you must never, happen\r\nwhat may, cast me off."\r\n\r\n"That is, as you say, what no one has ever been able to do," said he,\r\nsmiling.  "Your father\'s tenderness was greatest at the last; and\r\nMargaret loves you, you know, as her own soul.  Let us avoid promises,\r\nbut let us rest upon these truths.  And now," continued he, as he drew\r\nnearer to her, and made his shoulder a resting-place for her throbbing\r\nhead, "I have heard your thoughts for the future.  Will you hear mine?"\r\n\r\nHester made an effort to still her weeping.\r\n\r\n"I said just now, that I believe half the misery in our lives is owing\r\nto straining after happiness; and I think, too, that much of our sin is\r\nowing to our disturbing ourselves too much about our duty.  Instead of\r\nyielding a glad obedience from hour to hour, it is the weakness of many\r\nof us to stretch far forward into the future, which is beyond our\r\npresent reach, and torment ourselves with apprehensions of sin, which we\r\nshould be ashamed of if they related to pain and danger."\r\n\r\n"Oh, if you could prove to me that such is my weakness!" cried Hester.\r\n\r\n"I believe that it is yours, and I know that it is my own, my Hester.\r\nWe must watch over one another.  Tell me, is it not faithless to let our\r\nhearts be troubled about _any_ possible evil which we cannot, at the\r\nmoment of the trouble, prevent?  And are we not sacrificing, what is, at\r\nthe time, of the most importance--our repose of mind, the holiness, the\r\nreligion of the hour?"\r\n\r\n"I know I have defiled the holiness of this hour," said Hester, humbly.\r\n"But as my thoughts were troubled, was it not better to speak them?  I\r\ncould not but speak them."\r\n\r\n"You cannot but do and speak what is most honourable, and true, and\r\ngenerous, Hester; and that is the very reason why I would fain have you\r\ntrust, for the future as well as the present, to the impulse of the\r\nhour.  Surely, love, the probation of the hour is enough for the\r\nstrength of every one of us."\r\n\r\n"Far, far too much for me."\r\n\r\n"At times, too much for all.  Well, then, what have we to do?  To rest\r\nthe care of each other\'s happiness upon Him whose care it is: to be\r\nready to do without it, as we would hold ourselves ready to do without\r\nthis, or that, or the other comfort, or supposed means of happiness.\r\nDepend upon it, this happiness is too subtle and too divine a thing for\r\nour management.  We have nothing to do with it but to enjoy it when it\r\ncomes.  Men say of it--`Lo! it is here!\'--`Lo! there!\'--but never has\r\nman laid hold of it with a voluntary grasp."\r\n\r\n"But we can banish it," said Hester.\r\n\r\n"Alas! yes: and what else do we do at the very moment when we afflict\r\nourselves about the future?  Surely our business is to keep our hearts\r\nopen for it--holy and at peace, from moment to moment, from day to day."\r\n\r\n"And yet, is it not our privilege--said at least to be so--to look\r\nbefore and after?  I am not sure, however, that I always think this a\r\nprivilege.  I long sometimes to be any bird of the air, that I might\r\nlive for the present moment alone."\r\n\r\n"Let us be so far birds of the air--free as they, neither toiling nor\r\nspinning out anxious thoughts for the future: but why, with all this,\r\nshould we not use our human privilege of looking before and after, to\r\nenrich and sanctify the present?  Should we enjoy the wheat-fields in\r\nJune as we do if we knew nothing of seed-time, and had never heard of\r\nharvest?  And how should you and I feel at this moment, sitting here, if\r\nwe had no recollection of walks in shrubberies, and no prospect of a\r\nhome, and a lifetime to spend in it, to make this moment sacred?  Look\r\nat those red-breasts: shall we change lots with them?"\r\n\r\n"No, no: let us look forward; but how?  We cannot persuade ourselves\r\nthat we are better than we are, for the sake of making the future\r\nbright."\r\n\r\n"True: and therefore it must be God\'s future, and not our own, that we\r\nmust look forward to."\r\n\r\n"That is for confessors and martyrs," said Hester.  "They can look\r\npeacefully before and after, when there is a bright life and a world of\r\nhopes lying behind; and nothing around and before them but ignominy and\r\npoverty, or prison, or torture, or death.  They can do this: but not\r\nsuch as I.  God\'s future is enough for them--the triumph of truth and\r\nholiness; but--."\r\n\r\n"And I believe it would be enough for you in their situation, Hester.  I\r\nbelieve you could be a martyr for opinion.  Why cannot you and I brave\r\nthe suffering of our own faults as we would meet sickness or bereavement\r\nfrom Heaven, and torture and death from men?"\r\n\r\n"Is this the prospect in view of which you marry me?"\r\n\r\n"It is the prospect in view of which all of us are ever living, since we\r\nare all faulty, and must all suffer.  But marriage justifies a holier\r\nand happier anticipation.  The faults of human beings are temporary\r\nfeatures of their prospect: their virtues are the firm ground under\r\ntheir feet, and the bright arch over their heads.  Is it not so?"\r\n\r\n"If so, how selfish, how ungrateful have I been in making myself and you\r\nso miserable!  But I do so fear myself!"\r\n\r\n"Let us fear nothing, but give all our care to the day and the hour.  I\r\nam confident that this is the true obedience, and the true wisdom.  If\r\nthe temper of the hour is right, nothing is wrong."\r\n\r\n"And I am sure, if the temper of the hour is wrong, nothing is right.\r\nIf one could always remember this--."\r\n\r\n"If we could always remember this, we should perhaps find ourselves a\r\nlittle above the angels, instead of being, like the serene, the Fenelons\r\nof our race, a little below them.  We shall not always remember it,\r\nlove; but we must remind each other as faithfully as may be."\r\n\r\n"You must bring me here, when I forget," said Hester.  "This spring will\r\nalways murmur the truth to me--`If the temper of the hour is right\r\nnothing is wrong.\'  How wrong has my temper been within this hour!"\r\n\r\n"Let it pass, my Hester.  We are all faithless at times, and without the\r\nexcuse of meek and anxious love.  Is it possible that the moon casts\r\nthat shadow?"\r\n\r\n"The dark, dark hour is gone," said Hester, smiling as she looked up,\r\nand the moon shone on her face.  "Nothing is wrong.  Who would have\r\nbelieved, an hour ago, that I should now say so?"\r\n\r\n"When you would have given me up," said Hope, smiling.  "Oh, let us\r\nforget it all!  Let us go somewhere else.  Who will say this is winter?\r\nIs it October, or `the first mild day of March?\'  It might be either."\r\n\r\n"There is not a breath to chill us; and these leaves--what a soft autumn\r\ncarpet they make!  They have no wintry crispness yet."\r\n\r\nThere was one inexhaustible subject to which they now recurred--Mr\r\nHope\'s family.  He told over again, what Hester was never weary of\r\nhearing, how his sisters would cherish her, whenever circumstances\r\nshould allow them to meet--how Emily and she would suit best, but how\r\nAnne would look up to her.  As for Frank--.  But this representation of\r\nwhat Frank would say, and think, and do, was somewhat checked and\r\nimpaired by the recollection that Frank was just about this time\r\nreceiving the letter, in which Margaret\'s superiority to Hester was\r\npretty plainly set forth.  The answer to that letter would arrive, some\r\ntime or other, and the anticipated awkwardness of that circumstance\r\ncaused some unpleasant feelings at this moment, as it had often done\r\nbefore, during the last few weeks.  Nothing could be easier than to set\r\nthe matter right with Frank, as was already done with Emily and Anne;\r\nthe first letter might occasion some difficulty.  Frank was passed over\r\nlightly, and the foreground of the picture of family welcome was\r\noccupied by Emily and Anne.\r\n\r\nIt was almost an hour from their leaving the Spring before the lovers\r\nreached home.  They were neither cold nor tired; they were neither merry\r\nnor sad.  The traces of tears were on Hester\'s face; but even Margaret\r\nwas satisfied when she saw her leaning on Edward\'s arm, receiving the\r\npresents of the children where alone the children would present them--in\r\nthe new house.  There was no fancy about the arrangements, no ceremony\r\nabout the cake and the ring, to which Hester did not submit with perfect\r\ngrace.  Notwithstanding the traces of her tears, she had never looked so\r\nbeautiful.\r\n\r\nThe same opinion was repeated the next morning by all the many who saw\r\nher in church, or who caught a glimpse of her, in her way to and from\r\nit.  No wedding was ever kept a secret in Deerbrook; and Mr Hope\'s was\r\nthe one in which concealment was least of all possible.  The church was\r\nhalf full, and the path to the church-door was lined with gazers.  Those\r\nwho were obliged to remain at home looked abroad from their doors; so\r\nthat all were gratified more or less.  Every one on Mr Grey\'s premises\r\nhad a holiday--including Miss Young, though Mrs Rowland did not see why\r\nher children should lose a day\'s instruction, because a distant cousin\r\nof Mr Grey\'s was married.  The marriage was made far too much a fuss of\r\nfor her taste; and she vowed that whenever she parted with her own\r\nMatilda, there should be a much greater refinement in the mode.  Every\r\none else appeared satisfied.  The sun shone; the bells rang; and the\r\nservants drank the health of the bride and bridegroom.  Margaret\r\nsucceeded in swallowing her tears, and was, in her inmost soul, thankful\r\nfor Hester and herself.  The letters to Mr Hope\'s sisters and brother,\r\nleft open for the signatures of Edward and Hester Hope, were closed and\r\ndespatched; and the news was communicated to two or three of the\r\nIbbotsons\' nearest friends at Birmingham.  Mr and Mrs Grey agreed, at\r\nthe end of the day, that a wedding was, to be sure, a most fatiguing\r\naffair for quiet people like themselves; but that nothing could have\r\ngone off better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIFTEEN.\r\n\r\nMARIA AND MARGARET.\r\n\r\nMr Hope\'s professional duties would not permit him to be long absent,\r\neven on such an occasion as his wedding journey.  The young couple went\r\nonly to Oxford, and were to return in a week.  Margaret thought that\r\nthis week never would be over.  It was not only that she longed for rest\r\nin a home once more, and was eager to repose upon her new privilege of\r\nhaving a brother: she was also anxious about Hester,--anxious to be\r\nconvinced, by the observation of the eye and the hearing of the ear,\r\nthat her sister was enjoying that peace of spirit which reason seemed to\r\ndeclare must be hers.  It would be difficult to determine how much\r\nMargaret\'s attachment to her sister was deepened and strengthened by the\r\nincessant solicitude she had felt for her, ever since this attachment\r\nhad grown out of the companionship of their childhood.  She could\r\nscarcely remember the time when she had not been in a state of either\r\nhope or fear for Hester;--hope that, in some new circumstances, she\r\nwould be happy at last; or dread lest these new circumstances should\r\nfail, as all preceding influences had failed.  If Hester had been less\r\ncandid and less generous than she was, her sister\'s affection might have\r\ngiven way under the repeated trials and disappointments it had had to\r\nsustain; and there were times when Margaret\'s patience _had_ given way,\r\nand she had for a brief while wished, and almost resolved, that she\r\ncould and would regard with indifference the state of mind of one who\r\nwas not reasonable, and who seemed incapable of being contented.  But\r\nsuch resolutions of indifference dissolved before her sister\'s next\r\nmanifestations of generosity, or appeals to the forgiveness of those\r\nabout her.  Margaret always ended by supposing herself the cause of the\r\nevil; that she had been inconsiderate; that she could not allow\r\nsufficiently for a sensitiveness greater than her own; and above all,\r\nthat she was not fully worthy of such affection as Hester\'s--not\r\nsufficient for such a mind and heart.  She had looked forward, with\r\nardent expectation when she was happiest, and with sickly dread when she\r\nwas depressed, to the event of Hester\'s marriage, as that which must\r\ndecide whether she could be happy, or whether her life was to be\r\nthroughout the scene of conflict that its opening years had been.\r\nHester\'s connexion was all that she could have desired, and far beyond\r\nher utmost hopes.  This brother-in-law was one of a thousand--one whom\r\nshe was ready to consider a good angel sent to shed peace over her\r\nsister\'s life: and during the months of her engagement, she had kept\r\nanxiety at bay, and resigned herself to the delights of gratitude and of\r\nsweet anticipations, and to the satisfaction of feeling that her own\r\nresponsibilities might be considered at an end.  She had delivered\r\nHester\'s happiness over into the charge of one who would cherish it\r\nbetter and more successfully than she had done; and she could not but\r\nfeel the relief of the freedom she had gained: but neither could she\r\nrepress her anxiety to know, at the outset, whether all was indeed as\r\nwell as she had till now undoubtingly supposed that it would be.\r\n\r\nMargaret\'s attachment to her sister would have been in greater danger of\r\nbeing worn out but for the existence of a closer sympathy between them\r\nthan any one but themselves, and perhaps Morris, was aware of.  Margaret\r\nhad a strong suspicion that in Hester\'s place her temper would have been\r\nexactly what Hester\'s was in its least happy characteristics.  She had\r\ntendencies to jealousy; and if not to morbid self-study, and to\r\ndissatisfaction with present circumstances, she was indebted for this,\r\nshe knew, to her being occupied with her sister, and yet more to the\r\nperpetual warning held up before her eyes.  This conviction generated no\r\nsense of superiority in Margaret--interfered in no degree with the\r\nreverence she entertained for Hester, a reverence rather enhanced than\r\nimpaired by the tender compassion, with which she regarded her mental\r\nconflicts and sufferings.  Every movement of irritability in herself\r\n(and she was conscious of many) alarmed and humbled her, but, at the\r\nsame time, enabled her better to make allowance for her sister; and\r\nevery harsh word and unreasonable mood of Hester\'s, by restoring her to\r\nher self-command and stimulating her magnanimity, made her sensible that\r\nshe owed much of her power over herself to that circumstance which kept\r\nthe necessity of it perpetually before her mind.  For the same reason\r\nthat men hate those whom they have injured, Margaret loved with unusual\r\nfervour the sister with whom she had to forbear.  For the same reason\r\nthat the children, even the affectionate children, of tyrannical or lax\r\nparents, love liberty and conscientiousness above all else, Margaret was\r\nin practice gentle, long-suffering, and forgetful of self.  For the same\r\nreason that the afflicted are looked upon by the pure-minded as sacred,\r\nMargaret regarded her sister with a reverence which preserved her\r\npatience from being spent, and her attachment from wasting away.\r\n\r\nThe first letter from her brother and sister had been opened in great\r\ninternal agitation.  All was well, however.  It was certain that all was\r\nwell; for, while Hester said not one word about being happy, she was\r\nfull of thought for others.  She knew that Margaret meant to take\r\npossession of the corner-house, to "go home," a few days before the\r\narrival of the travellers, in order to make all comfortable for them.\r\nHester begged that she would take care to be well amused during these\r\nfew days.  Perhaps she might induce Maria Young to waive the ceremony of\r\nbeing first invited by the real housekeepers, and to spend as much time\r\nas she could with her friend.  "Give my kind regards to Maria," said the\r\nletter, "and tell her I like to fancy you two passing a long evening by\r\nthat fireside where we all hope we shall often have the pleasure of\r\nseeing her."  Six months ago Hester would not have spoken so freely and\r\nso kindly of Maria: she would not have so sanctioned Margaret\'s intimacy\r\nwith her.  All was right, and Margaret was happy.\r\n\r\nMaria came, and, thanks to the holiday spirit of a wedding week, for a\r\nlong day.  Delicious are the pleasures of those whose appetite for them\r\nis whetted by abstinence.  Charming, wholly charming, was this day to\r\nMaria, spent in quiet, free from the children, free from the observation\r\nof other guests, passed in all external luxury, and in sister-like\r\nconfidence with the friend to whom she had owed some of the best\r\npleasures of the last year.  Margaret was no less happy in indulging\r\nher, and in opening much more of her heart to her than she could to any\r\none else since Hester married--which now, at the end of six days, seemed\r\na long time ago.\r\n\r\nMiss Young came early, that she might see the house, and everything in\r\nit, before dark; and the days were now at their shortest.  She did not\r\nmind the fatigue of mounting to the very top of the house.  She must see\r\nthe view from the window of Morris\'s attic.  Yesterday\'s fall of snow\r\nhad made the meadows one sheet of white; and the river looked black, and\r\nthe woods somewhat frowning and dismal; but those who knew the place so\r\nwell could imagine what all this must be in summer; and Morris was\r\nassured that her room was the pleasantest in the house.  Morris\r\ncurtseyed and smiled, and did not say how cold and dreary a wide\r\nlandscape appeared to her, and how much better she should have liked to\r\nlook out upon a street, if only Mr Hope had happened to have been\r\nsettled in Birmingham.  She pointed out to Maria how good Miss Hester\r\nhad been, in thinking about the furnishing of this attic.  She had taken\r\nthe trouble to have the pictures of Morris\'s father and mother, which\r\nhad always hung opposite her bed at Birmingham, brought hither, and\r\nfixed up in the same place.  The bed-hangings had come, too; so that,\r\nexcept for its being so much lighter, and the prospect from the window\r\nso different, it was almost like the same room she had slept in for\r\nthree-and-twenty years before.  When Maria looked at "the pictures"--\r\nsilhouettes taken from shadows on the wall, with numerous little\r\ndeformities and disproportions incident to that method of taking\r\nlikenesses--she appreciated Hester\'s thoughtfulness; though she fully\r\nagreed in what Margaret said, that if Morris was willing to leave a\r\nplace where she had lived so many years, for the sake of remaining with\r\nHester and her, it was the least they could do to make her feel as much\r\nat home as possible in her new abode.\r\n\r\nMargaret\'s own chamber was one of the prettiest rooms in the house, with\r\nits light green paper, its French bed and toilet at one end, and the\r\nbook-case, table and writing-desk, footstool and armchair, at the other.\r\n\r\n"I shall spend many hours alone here in the bright summer mornings,"\r\nsaid Margaret.  "Here I shall write my letters, and study, and think."\r\n\r\n"And nod over your books, perhaps," said Maria.  "These seem comfortable\r\narrangements for an old or infirm person; but I should be afraid they\r\nwould send you to sleep.  You have had little experience of being alone:\r\ndo you know the strong tendency that solitary people have to napping?"\r\n\r\nMargaret laughed.  She had never slept in the daytime in her life,\r\nexcept in illness.  She could not conceive of it, in the case of a young\r\nperson, full of occupation, with a hundred things to think about, and\r\ntwenty books at a time that she wanted to read.  She thought that\r\nregular daily solitude must be the most delightful, the most improving\r\nthing in the world.  She had always envied the privilege of people who\r\ncould command solitude; and now, for the first time in her life, she was\r\ngoing to enjoy it, and try to profit by it.\r\n\r\n"You began yesterday, I think," said Maria.  "How did you like it?"\r\n\r\n"It was no fair trial.  I felt restless at having the house in my\r\ncharge; and I was thinking of Hester perpetually; and then I did not\r\nknow but that some of the Greys might come in at any moment: and\r\nbesides, I was so busy considering whether I was making the most of the\r\nprecious hours, that I really did next to nothing all day."\r\n\r\n"But you looked sadly tired at night, Miss Margaret," said Morris.  "I\r\nnever saw you more fit for bed after any party or ball."\r\n\r\nMaria smiled.  She knew something of the fatigues, as well as the\r\npleasures, of solitude.  Margaret smiled too; but she said it would be\r\nquite another thing when the family were settled, and when it should\r\nhave become a habit to spend the morning hours alone; and to this Maria\r\nfully agreed.\r\n\r\nMorris thought that people\'s liking or not liking to be alone depended\r\nmuch on their having easy or irksome thoughts in their minds.  Margaret\r\nanswered gaily, that in that case, she was pretty sure of liking\r\nsolitude.  She was made grave by a sigh and a shake of the head from\r\nMorris.\r\n\r\n"Morris, what do you mean?" said Margaret, apprehensively.  "Why do you\r\nsigh and shake your head?  Why should not I have easy thoughts as often\r\nas I sit in that chair?"\r\n\r\n"We never know, Miss Margaret, my dear, how things will turn out.  Do\r\nyou remember Miss Stevenson, that married a gentleman her family all\r\nthought a great deal of, and he turned out a swindler, and--?"\r\n\r\nThe girls burst out a-laughing, and Maria assured Morris that she could\r\nanswer for no accident of that kind happening with regard to Mr Hope.\r\nMorris laughed too, and said she did not mean that, but only that she\r\nnever saw anybody more confident of everything going right than Miss\r\nStevenson and all her family; and within a month after the wedding, they\r\nwere in the deepest distress.  That was what she meant: but there were\r\nmany other ways of distress happening.\r\n\r\n"There is death, my dears," she said.  "Remember death, Miss Margaret."\r\n\r\n"Indeed, Morris, I do," said Margaret.  "I never thought so much of\r\ndeath as I have done since Mr Hope\'s accident, when I believed death\r\nwas coming to make us all miserable; and the more I have since recoiled\r\nfrom it, the oftener has the thought come back."\r\n\r\n"That is all right, my dear: all very natural.  It does not seem natural\r\nto undertake any great new thing in life, without reminding one\'s self\r\nof the end that must come to all our doings.  However, I trust my master\r\nand mistress, and you, have many a happy year to live."\r\n\r\n"I like those words, Morris.  I like to hear you speak of your master\r\nand mistress, it has such a domestic sound!  Does it not make one feel\r\nat home, Maria?  Yes, Morris, there I shall sit, and feel so at ease! so\r\nat home, once more!"\r\n\r\n"But there may be other--."  Morris stopped, and changed her mood.  She\r\nstepped to the closet, and opened the door, to show Miss Young the\r\nprovision of shelves and pegs; and pointed out the part of the room\r\nwhere she had hoped there would be a sofa.  She should have liked that\r\nMiss Margaret should have had a sofa to lie down on when she pleased.\r\nIt seemed to her the only thing wanting.  Margaret gaily declared that\r\nnothing was wanting.  She had never seen a room more entirely to her\r\ntaste, though she had inhabited some that were grander.\r\n\r\nBy the time the little breakfast-room had been duly visited, and it had\r\nbeen explained that the other small parlour must necessarily be kept for\r\na waiting-room for Mr Hope\'s patients, and the young ladies had\r\nreturned to the drawing-room, Maria was in full flow of sympathy with\r\nthe housekeeping interests and ideas which occupied, or rather amused,\r\nher companion.  Women do inevitably love housekeeping, unless\r\neducational or other impediments interfere with their natural tastes.\r\nHousehold management is to them the object of their talents, the subject\r\nof their interests, the vehicle of their hopes and fears, the medium\r\nthrough which their affections are manifested, and much of their\r\nbenevolence gratified.  If it be true, as has been said, that there is\r\nno good quality of a woman\'s heart and mind which is not necessary to\r\nperfect housekeeping, it follows that there is no power of the mind or\r\naffection of the heart which may not be gratified in the course of its\r\ndischarge.  As Margaret and her guest enjoyed their pheasant, their\r\ntable drawn close to the sofa and the fire, that Maria might be saved\r\nthe trouble of moving, their talk was of tradespeople, of shopping at\r\nDeerbrook, and the market at Birmingham; of the kitchen and store-room,\r\nand the winter and summer arrangements of the table.  The foot-boy, whom\r\nMargaret was teaching to wait, often forgot his function, and stood\r\nstill to listen, and at last left the room deeply impressed with the\r\nwisdom of his instructor and her guest.  When the dinner and the wine\r\nwere gone, they sang, they gossiped, they quizzed.  The Greys were\r\nsacred, of course; but many an anecdote came out, told honestly and with\r\ngood-nature, of dear old Mrs Enderby, and her talent for being pleased;\r\nof Mrs Rowland\'s transactions abroad and at home--all regulated by the\r\nprinciple of eclipsing the Greys; and of Mrs Howell\'s and Miss Miskin\'s\r\nfine sentiments, and extraordinary pieces of news.  Margaret produced\r\nsome of her brother-in-law\'s outlines, which she had picked up and\r\npreserved--sketches of the children, in the oddest attitudes of\r\nchildren--of Dr Levitt, resting his book on the end of his nose, as he\r\nread in his study-chair--of Mrs Plumstead, exasperated by the arrival\r\nof an illegible letter--of almost every oddity in the place.  Then out\r\ncame the pencils, and the girls supplied omissions.  They sketched Mr\r\nHope himself; listening to an old woman\'s theory of her own case; they\r\nsketched each other.  Mr Enderby was almost the only person omitted\r\naltogether, in conversation and on paper.\r\n\r\n"Where can I have hidden my work bag?" asked Maria, after tea.\r\n\r\n"You laid it beside you, and I put it away," said Margaret.  "I wanted\r\nto see whether you could spend a whole afternoon without the feel of\r\nyour thimble.  You shall have it again now, for you never once asked for\r\nit between dinner and tea."\r\n\r\n"I forgot it: but now you must give it me.  I must finish my collar, or\r\nI shall not duly honour your sister in my first call.  We can talk as\r\nwell working as idle."\r\n\r\n"Cannot I help you?  Our affairs are all in such dreadfully perfect\r\norder, that I have not a stitch of work to do.  I see a hole in your\r\nglove: let me mend it."\r\n\r\n"Do; and when you have done that, there is the other.  Two years hence,\r\nhow you will wonder that there ever was a time when you had not a stitch\r\nof work in the house!  Wedding clothes last about two years, and then\r\nthey all wear out together.  I wish you joy of the work you will have to\r\ndo then--if nothing should come between you and it."\r\n\r\n"What should come between us and it?" said Margaret, struck by the tone\r\nin which Maria spoke the last words.  "Are you following Morris\'s lead?\r\nAre you going to say,--`Remember death, Miss Margaret?\'"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no; but there are other things which happen sometimes besides\r\ndeath.  I beg your pardon, Margaret, if I am impertinent--"\r\n\r\n"How should you be impertinent?  You, the most intimate friend but one\r\nthat I have in the world!  You mean marriage of course; that I may marry\r\nwithin these same two years?  Any one may naturally say so, I suppose,\r\nto a girl whose sister is just married: and in another person\'s case it\r\nwould seem to me probable enough, but I assure you, Maria, I do not feel\r\nas if it was at all likely that I should marry."\r\n\r\n"I quite believe you, Margaret.  I have no doubt you feel so, and that\r\nyou will feel so till--.  But, dear, you may one day find yourself\r\nfeeling very differently without a moment\'s warning; and that day may\r\nhappen within two years.  Such things have been known."\r\n\r\n"If there was any one--" said Margaret, simply--"if I had ever seen any\r\none for whom I could fancy myself feeling as Hester did--"\r\n\r\n"If there was any one!"--repeated Maria, looking up in some surprise.\r\n"My dear Margaret, do you mean to say there is no one?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I do; I think so.  I know what you mean, Maria.  I understand your\r\nface and your voice.  But I do think it is very hard that one cannot\r\nenjoy a pleasant friendship with anybody without seeing people on the\r\nwatch for something more.  It is so very painful to have such ideas put\r\ninto one\'s mind, to spoil all one\'s intercourse--to throw restraint over\r\nit--to mix up selfishness with it!  It is so wrong to interfere between\r\nthose who might and would be the most useful and delightful companions\r\nto each other, without having a thought which need put constraint\r\nbetween them!  Those who so interfere have a great deal to answer for.\r\nThey do not know what mischief they may be doing--what pain they may be\r\ngiving while they are gossiping, and making remarks to one another about\r\nwhat they know nothing at all about.  I have no patience with such\r\nmeddling!"\r\n\r\n"So I perceive, indeed," replied Maria, somewhat amused.  "But,\r\nMargaret, you have been enlarging a good deal on what I said.  Not a\r\nsyllable was spoken about any remarks, any observations between any\r\npeople; or even about reference to any particular person.  I alone must\r\nbe subject to all this displeasure, and even I did not throw out a\r\nsingle hint about any friend of yours."\r\n\r\n"No, you did not; that is all very true," said Margaret, blushing: "but\r\nneither was I vexed with you;--at least, not so much as with some\r\nothers.  I was hasty."\r\n\r\n"You were, indeed," said Maria, laughing.  "I never witnessed such an\r\noutburst from you before."\r\n\r\n"And you shall not see such another; but I was answering less what you\r\nsaid than what I have reason to suppose is in the minds of several other\r\npeople."\r\n\r\n"In their minds?  They have not told you their thoughts, then.  And\r\n_several_ other people, too!  Why, Margaret, I really think it is not\r\nvery reasonable in you to find fault with others for thinking something\r\nwhich they have not troubled you to listen to, and which is so natural,\r\nthat it has struck `several\' of them.  Surely, Margaret, you must be a\r\nlittle, just a very little, touchy upon the matter."\r\n\r\n"Touchy!  What should make me touchy?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, what?"\r\n\r\n"I do assure you, Maria, nothing whatever has passed between that person\r\nand me which has anything more than the commonest--No, I will not say\r\nthe commonest friendship, because I believe ours is a very warm and\r\nintimate friendship; but indeed it is nothing more.  You may be sure\r\nthat, if it had been otherwise, I should not have said a word upon the\r\nwhole matter, even to you; and I would not have allowed even you to\r\nspeak ten words to me about it.  Are you satisfied now?"\r\n\r\n"I am satisfied that you any what you think."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Maria! what a sigh!  If you have no objection, I should like to\r\nknow the meaning of that sigh."\r\n\r\n"I was thinking of `the course of true love.\'"\r\n\r\n"But not that it `never does run smooth.\'  That is not true.  Witness\r\nHester\'s."\r\n\r\n"Dear Margaret, be not presumptuous!  Consider how early the days of\r\nthat love are yet."\r\n\r\n"And that love in their case has only just leaped out of the fountain,\r\nand can hardly be said to have begun its course.  Well! may Heaven smile\r\non it!  But tell me about that course of love which made you sigh as you\r\ndid just now."\r\n\r\n"What can I tell you about it?  And yet, you shall know, if you like,\r\nhow it appears to me."\r\n\r\n"Oh, tell me!  I shall see whether you would have understood Hester\'s\r\ncase."\r\n\r\n"The first strange thing is, that every woman approaches this crisis of\r\nher life as unawares as if she were the first that ever loved."\r\n\r\n"And yet all girls are brought up to think of marriage as almost the\r\nonly event in life.  Their minds are stuffed with thoughts of it almost\r\nbefore they have had time to gain any other ideas."\r\n\r\n"Merely as means to ends low enough for their comprehension.  It is not\r\nmarriage--wonderful, holy, mysterious marriage--that their minds are\r\nfull of, but connection with somebody or something which will give them\r\nmoney, and ease, and station, and independence of their parents.  This\r\nhas nothing to do with love.  I was speaking of love--the grand\r\ninfluence of a woman\'s life, but whose name is a mere empty sound to her\r\ntill it becomes, suddenly, secretly, a voice which shakes her being to\r\nthe very centre--more awful, more tremendous, than the crack of doom."\r\n\r\n"But why?  Why so tremendous?"\r\n\r\n"From the struggle which it calls upon her to endure, silently and\r\nalone;--from the agony of a change of existence which must be wrought\r\nwithout any eye perceiving it.  Depend upon it, Margaret, there is\r\nnothing in death to compare with this change; and there can be nothing\r\nin entrance upon another state which can transcend the experience I\r\nspeak of.  Our powers can but be taxed to the utmost.  Our being can but\r\nbe strained till not another effort can be made.  This is all that we\r\ncan conceive to happen in death; and it happens in love, with the\r\nadditional burden of fearful secrecy.  One may lie down and await death,\r\nwith sympathy about one to the last, though the passage hence must be\r\nsolitary; and it would be a small trouble if all the world looked on to\r\nsee the parting of soul and body: but that other passage into a new\r\nstate, that other process of becoming a new creature, must go on in the\r\ndarkness of the spirit, while the body is up and abroad, and no one must\r\nknow what is passing within.  The spirit\'s leap from heaven to hell must\r\nbe made while the smile is on the lips, and light words are upon the\r\ntongue.  The struggles of shame, the pangs of despair, must be hidden in\r\nthe depths of the prison-house.  Every groan must be stifled before it\r\nis heard: and as for tears--they are a solace too gentle for the case.\r\nThe agony is too strong for tears."\r\n\r\n"Is this true love?" asked Margaret, in agitation.\r\n\r\n"This is true love; but not the whole of it.  As for what follows--"\r\n\r\n"But is this what every woman has to undergo?"\r\n\r\n"Do you suppose that every woman knows what love really is?  No; not\r\neven every unmarried woman.  There are some among them, though I believe\r\nbut few, who know nothing of what love is; and there are, undoubtedly, a\r\nmultitude of wives who have experienced liking, preference, affection,\r\nand taken it for love; and who reach their life\'s end without being\r\naware that they have never loved.  There are also, I trust, a multitude\r\nof wives who have really loved, and who have reaped the best fruits of\r\nit in regeneration of soul."\r\n\r\n"But how dreadful is the process, if it be as you say!"\r\n\r\n"I said I had alluded to only a part of it.  As for what follows,\r\naccording as it is prosperous or unreturned love, heaven ensues upon\r\nthis purgatory, or one may attain a middle region, somewhat dim, but\r\nserene.  You wish me to be plainer?"\r\n\r\n"I wish to hear all you think--all you know.  But do not let us go on\r\nwith it if it makes you sigh so."\r\n\r\n"What woman ever spoke of love without sighing?" said Maria, with a\r\nsmile.  "You sighed yourself, just now."\r\n\r\n"I was thinking of Hester, I believe.  How strange, if this process\r\nreally awaits women--if it is a region through which their path of life\r\nmust stretch--and no one gives warning, or preparation, or help!"\r\n\r\n"It is not so strange as at first sight it seems.  Every mother and\r\nfriend hopes that no one else has suffered as she did--that her\r\nparticular charge may escape entirely, or get off more easily.  Then\r\nthere is the shame of confession which is involved: some conclude, at a\r\ndistance of time, that they must have exaggerated their own sufferings,\r\nor have been singularly rebellious and unreasonable.  Some lose the\r\nsense of the anguish in the subsequent happiness; and there are not a\r\nfew who, from constitution of mind, forget altogether `the things that\r\nare behind.\'  When you remember, too, that it is the law of nature and\r\nprovidence that each should bear his and her own burden, and that no\r\nwarning would be of any avail, it seems no longer so strange that while\r\ngirls hear endlessly of marriage, they are kept wholly in the dark about\r\nlove."\r\n\r\n"Would warning really be of no avail?"\r\n\r\n"Of no more avail than warning to a pilgrim in the middle of the desert\r\nthat he will suffer from thirst, and be deluded by the mirage, before he\r\ngets into green fields again.  He has no longer the choice whether to be\r\na pilgrim in the desert or to stay at home.  No one of us has the choice\r\nto be or not to be; and we must go through with our experience, under\r\nits natural conditions."\r\n\r\n"`To be or not to be,\'" said Margaret, with a grave smile.  "You remind\r\none that the choice of suicide remains: and I almost wonder--Surely\r\nsuicide has been committed from dread of lighter woes than you have\r\ndescribed."\r\n\r\n"I believe so: but in this case there is no dread.  We find ourselves in\r\nthe midst of the struggle before we are aware.  And then--"\r\n\r\n"Ay, and then--"\r\n\r\n"He, who appoints the struggles of the spirit, supplies aids and\r\nsupports.  I fully believe that this time of conflict is that in which\r\nreligion first becomes to many the reality, for which they ever\r\nafterwards live.  It may have been hitherto a name, a fancy, a dim\r\nabstraction, or an intermitting though bright influence: and it may yet\r\nbe resorted to merely as a refuge for the spirit which can find no\r\nother.  But there is a strong probability that it may now be found to be\r\na wonderful reality; not only a potent charm in sorrow, but the life of\r\nour life.  This is with many the reason why, and the mode in which, the\r\nconflict is endured to the end."\r\n\r\n"But the beginning," said Margaret; "what can be the beginning of this\r\nwonderful experience?"\r\n\r\n"The same with that of all the most serious of our experiences--levity,\r\nunconsciousness, confidence.  Upon what subject in the world is there a\r\ngreater accumulation of jokes than upon love and marriage; and upon what\r\nsubject are jokes so indefatigably current?  A girl laughs at her\r\ncompanions, and blushes or pouts for herself; as girls have done for\r\nthousands of years before her.  She finds, by degrees, new, and sweet,\r\nand elevated ideas of friendship stealing their way into her mind, and\r\nshe laments and wonders that the range of friendship is not wider--that\r\nits action is not freer--that girls may not enjoy intimate friendship\r\nwith the companions of their brothers, as well as with their own.  There\r\nis a quick and strong resentment at any one who smiles at, or speculates\r\nupon, or even observes the existence of such a friendship."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Maria!" exclaimed Margaret, throwing down her work, and covering\r\nher face with her hands.\r\n\r\n"This goes on for a while," proceeded Maria, as if she did not observe\r\nher companion, "this goes on for a while, smoothly, innocently,\r\nserenely.  Mankind are then true and noble, the world is passing fair,\r\nand God is tender and bountiful.  All evil is seen to be tending to\r\ngood; all tears are meant to be wiped away; the gloom of the gloomy is\r\nfaithless; virtue is easy and charming; and the vice of the vicious is\r\nunaccountable.  Thus does young life glide on for a time.  Then there\r\ncomes a day--it is often a mystery why it should be that day of all\r\ndays--when the innocent, and gay, and confident young creature finds\r\nherself in sudden trouble.  The film on which she lightly trod has burst\r\nand she is in an abyss.  It seems a mere trifle that plunged her there.\r\nHer friend did not come when she looked for him, or he is gone\r\nsomewhere, or he has said something that she did not expect.  Some such\r\ntrifle reveals to her that she depends wholly upon him--that she has for\r\nlong been living only for him, and on the unconscious conclusion that he\r\nhas been living only for her.  At the image of his dwelling anywhere but\r\nby her side, of his having any interest apart from hers, the universe\r\nis, in a moment, shrouded in gloom.  Her heart is sick, and there is no\r\nrest for it, for her self-respect is gone.  She has been reared in a\r\nmaidenly pride, and an innocent confidence: her confidence is wholly\r\nbroken-down; her pride is wounded and the agony of the wound is\r\nintolerable.  We are wont to say, Margaret, that everything is endurable\r\nbut a sense of guilt.  If there be an exception, this is it.  This\r\nwounding of the spirit ought not perhaps to be, but it is very like the\r\nsting of guilt; and a `wounded spirit who can bear?\'"\r\n\r\n"How is it borne--so many as are the sufferers, and of a class usually\r\nthought so weak?"\r\n\r\n"That is a mistake.  There is not on earth a being stronger than a woman\r\nin the concealment of her love.  The soldier is called brave who\r\ncheerfully bears about the pain of a laceration to his dying day; and\r\ncriminals, who, after years of struggle, unbosom themselves of their\r\nsecret, give tremendous accounts of the sufferings of those years; but I\r\nquestion whether a woman whose existence has been burdened with an\r\nunrequited love, will not have to unfold in the next world a more\r\nharrowing tale than either of these."\r\n\r\n"It ought not to be so."\r\n\r\n"It ought not, where there is no guilt.  But how noble is such power of\r\nself-restraint!  Though the principle of society may be to cultivate our\r\npride to excess, what fortitude grows out of it!  There are no bounds to\r\nthe horror, disgust, and astonishment expressed when a woman owns her\r\nlove to its object unasked--even urges it upon him; but I acknowledge my\r\nsurprise to be the other way--that the cases are so rare.  Yet, fancying\r\nthe case one\'s own--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, dreadful!" cried Margaret.\r\n\r\n"No woman can endure the bare thought of the case being her own; and\r\nthis proves the strong natural and educational restraint under which we\r\nall lie: but I must think that the frequent and patient endurance proves\r\na strength of soul, a vigour of moral power, which ought to console and\r\nanimate us in the depth of our abasement, if we could but recall it then\r\nwhen we want support and solace most."\r\n\r\n"It can be little estimated--little understood," said Margaret, "or it\r\nwould not be sported with as it is."\r\n\r\n"Do not let us speak of that, Margaret.  You talk of my philosophy\r\nsometimes; I own that that part of the subject is too much for any\r\nphilosophy I have."\r\n\r\n"I see nothing philosophical," said Margaret, "in making light of the\r\ndeepest cruelty and treachery which is transacted under the sun.  A man\r\nwho trifles with such affections, and abuses such moral power, and calls\r\nhis cruelty flirtation--"\r\n\r\n"Is such an one as we will not speak of now.  Well! it cannot be but\r\nthat good--moral and intellectual good--must issue from such exercise\r\nand discipline as this; and such good does issue often, perhaps\r\ngenerally.  There are sad tales sung and told everywhere of brains\r\ncrazed, and graves dug by hopeless love: and I fear that many more sink\r\ndown into disease and death from this cause, than are at all suspected\r\nto be its victims: but not a few find themselves lifted up from their\r\nabyss, and set free from their bondage of pride and humiliation.  They\r\nmarry their loves and stand amazed at their own bliss, and are truly the\r\nhappiest people upon earth, and in the broad road to be the wisest.  In\r\nmy belief, the happiest are ever so."\r\n\r\n"Bless you for that, for Hester\'s sake!  And what of those who are not\r\nthus released?"\r\n\r\n"They get out of the abyss too; but they have to struggle out alone.\r\nTheir condition must depend much on what they were before the conflict\r\nbefell them.  Some are soured, and live restlessly.  Some are weak, and\r\ncome out worldly, and sacrifice themselves, in marriage or otherwise,\r\nfor low objects.  Some strive to forget, and to become as like as\r\npossible to what they were before; and of this order are many of the\r\nwomen whom we meet, whose minds are in a state of perpetual and\r\nincurable infancy.  It is difficult to see the purpose of their\r\nsuffering, from any effects it appears to have produced: but then there\r\nis the hope that their griefs were not of the deepest."\r\n\r\n"And what of those whose griefs are of the deepest?"\r\n\r\n"They rise the highest above them.  Some of these must be content with\r\nhaving learned more or less, of what life is, and of what it is for, and\r\nwith reconciling themselves to its objects and conditions."\r\n\r\n"In short, with being philosophical," said Margaret, with an inquiring\r\nand affectionate glance at her friend.\r\n\r\n"With being philosophical," Maria smilingly agreed.  "Others, of a\r\nhappier nature, to whom philosophy and religion come as one, and are\r\nwelcomed by energies not wholly destroyed, and affections not altogether\r\ncrushed, are strong in the new strength which they have found, with\r\nhearts as wide as the universe, and spirits the gayest of the gay."\r\n\r\n"You never told me anything of all this before," said Margaret; "yet it\r\nis plain that you must have thought much about it--that it must have\r\nbeen long in your mind."\r\n\r\n"It has; and I tell it to you, that you may share what I have learned,\r\ninstead of going without the knowledge, or, alas! gathering it up for\r\nyourself."\r\n\r\n"Oh, then, it is so--it is from your own--"\r\n\r\n"It is from my own experience that I speak," said Maria, without looking\r\nup.  "And now, there is some one in the world who knows it beside\r\nmyself."\r\n\r\n"I hope you do not--I hope you never will repent having told me," said\r\nMargaret, rising and taking her seat on the sofa, beside her friend.\r\n\r\n"I do not, and I shall not repent," said Maria.  "You are faithful: and\r\nit will be a relief to me to have sympathy--to be able to speak\r\nsometimes, instead of having to deny and repress my whole heart and\r\nsoul.  But I can tell you no more--not one word."\r\n\r\n"Do not.  Only show me how I can comfort--how I can gratify you."\r\n\r\n"I need no special comfort now," said Maria, smiling.  "I _have_\r\nsometimes grievously wanted a friend to love and speak with--and if I\r\ncould, to serve.  Now I have a friend."  And the look with which she\r\ngazed at her companion brought the tears into Margaret\'s eyes.\r\n\r\n"Come, let us speak of something else," said Maria, cheerfully.  "When\r\ndo you expect your friend, Mr Enderby, at Deerbrook again?"\r\n\r\n"His sister says nobody knows; and I do not think he can tell himself.\r\nYou know he does not live at Deerbrook."\r\n\r\n"I am aware of that; but his last visit was such a long one--"\r\n\r\n"Six days," said Margaret, laughing.\r\n\r\n"Ah!  I did not mean his last week\'s appearance, or any of his pop\r\nvisits.  I was thinking of his summer visitation.  It was so long, that\r\nsome people began to look upon him as a resident."\r\n\r\n"If his mother does not grow much better soon, we shall see him again,"\r\nsaid Margaret.  "It is always her illness that brings him.--Do you not\r\nbelieve me, Maria?"\r\n\r\n"I believe, as before, that you say what you think.  Whether you are\r\nmistaken is another question, which I cannot pretend to answer."\r\n\r\n"I hope, Maria, that as you have placed so much confidence in me, you\r\nwill not stop short at the very point which is of the greatest\r\nimportance to me."\r\n\r\n"I will not, dear.  What I think on the subject of Mr Enderby, in\r\nrelation to you, is, that some of your friends believe that you are the\r\ncause of his stay having been so long in the summer, and of his coming\r\nso often since.  I know no more than this.  How should I?"\r\n\r\n"Then I will tell you something more, that I might as well have\r\nmentioned before.  When Mrs Rowland had an idea that Mr Enderby might\r\nthink of Hester, she told Hester--that miserable day in Dingleford\r\nwoods--that his family expected he would soon marry a young lady of\r\nfamily and fortune, who was a great favourite with all his connections."\r\n\r\n"Who may this young lady be?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, she did not say; some one too high for our acquaintance, if we are\r\nto believe what Mrs Rowland declared."\r\n\r\n"And do you believe it?"\r\n\r\n"Why--.  Do you?"\r\n\r\n"I dare say Mrs Rowland may believe it herself; but she may be\r\nmistaken."\r\n\r\n"That is exactly what Hester said," observed Margaret, eagerly.  "And\r\nthat was more than five months ago, and we have not heard a syllable of\r\nthe matter since."\r\n\r\n"And so intimate a friendship as yours and Mr Enderby\'s is," said\r\nMaria, smiling,--"it is scarcely probable that his mind should be full\r\nof such an affair, and that he should be able to conceal it so perfectly\r\nfrom you."\r\n\r\n"I am glad you think so," said Margaret, ingenuously.  "You cannot\r\nimagine how strange it is to see Mrs Grey and others taking for granted\r\nthat he is free, when Hester and I could tell them in a moment what Mrs\r\nRowland said.  But if you think Mrs Rowland is all wrong, what do you\r\nreally suppose about his coming so much to Deerbrook?"\r\n\r\n"I have little doubt that those friends of yours--Mrs Grey and the\r\nothers--are right.  But--."\r\n\r\n"But what?"\r\n\r\n"Just this.  If I might warn you by myself; I would caution you, not\r\nonly against dwelling much upon such a fact, but against interpreting it\r\nto mean more than it possibly may.  This is my reason for speaking to\r\nyou upon the matter at all.  I do it because you will be pretty sure to\r\nhear how the fact itself is viewed by others, while no one else would be\r\nlikely to give you the caution.  Mr Enderby _may_ come, as you suppose,\r\nentirely to see his mother.  He may come to see you: but, supposing he\r\ndoes, if he is like other men, he may not know his own mind yet: and,\r\nthere is another possible thing--a thing which is possible, Margaret,\r\nthough he is such a dear and intimate friend--that he may not know\r\nyours--all its strength of affection, all its fidelity, all its trust\r\nand power of self-control."\r\n\r\n"Oh, stop; pray stop," said Margaret.  "You frighten me with the\r\nthoughts of all you have been saying this evening, though I could so\r\nentirely satisfy you as to what our intercourse has been--though I know\r\nMr Enderby so much better than you do.  You need warn me no more.  I\r\nwill think of what you have said, if I find myself doubting whether he\r\ncomes to see his mother--if I find myself listening to what others may\r\nsuppose about his reasons.  Indeed, I will remember what you have said."\r\n\r\n"Then I am glad I ventured to say it, particularly as you are not angry\r\nwith me this time."\r\n\r\n"I am not at all angry: how could I be so?  But I do not agree with you\r\nabout the fact."\r\n\r\n"I know it, and I may be mistaken."\r\n\r\n"Now tell me," said Margaret, "what you suppose Morris meant when she\r\nsaid what you heard about the pleasure of solitude depending on one\'s\r\nthoughts being happy or otherwise.  I know it is a common old idea\r\nenough; but Morris does not know that; and I am sure she had some\r\nparticular instance in view.  Morris does not make general propositions,\r\nexcept with a particular case in her mind\'s eye; and she is a wise\r\nwoman; and we think her sayings are weighty."\r\n\r\n"It struck me that she had a real probability in her mind; but I did not\r\nthink it related to Mr Enderby, or to anything so exclusively your own\r\nconcern."\r\n\r\n"No; I hope not: but what then?"\r\n\r\n"I think that Morris knows more of life and the world than you, and that\r\nshe does not anticipate quite so much happiness from Hester\'s marriage\r\nas you do.  Do not be distressed or alarmed.  She means no mistrust of\r\nanybody, I imagine; but only that there is no perfect happiness in this\r\nlife, that nobody is faultless; and no home, not even where her young\r\nladies live, is quite free from care and trouble.  It would not hurt\r\nyou, surely, if she was to say this outright to you?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no; nor a good deal more of the same tendency.  She might come much\r\nnearer to the point, good soul! without hurting me.  Suppose I ask her\r\nwhat it was she did mean, to-night or to-morrow, when she and I are\r\nalone?"\r\n\r\n"Well! if she is such a wise woman--.  But I doubt whether you could get\r\nher nearer to the point without danger of hurting her.  Can she bring\r\nherself to own that either of you have faults?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes: she has never spared us, from the time we were two feet high."\r\n\r\n"What can make you so anxious as to what she meant?"\r\n\r\n"I really hardly know, unless it be that where one loves very much, one\r\nfears--Oh, so faithlessly!  I know I ought to fear less for Hester than\r\never; and yet--."\r\n\r\nThe door burst open, and the foot-boy entered with his jingling tray,\r\nand news that the sedan for Miss Young was at the door.  What sedan?\r\nMargaret had asked Mrs Grey for hers, as the snow had fallen heavily,\r\nand the streets were not fit for Maria\'s walking.  Maria was very\r\nthankful.\r\n\r\nHere was an end of Maria\'s bright holiday.  Mr Grey\'s porters must not\r\nbe kept waiting.  The friends assured each other that they should never\r\nforget this day.  It was little likely that they should.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIXTEEN.\r\n\r\nHOME.\r\n\r\nMargaret had an unconscious expectation of seeing her sister altered.\r\nThis is an irresistible persuasion in almost every case where an\r\nintimate friend is absent, and is under new influences, and amidst new\r\ncircumstances.  These accessories alter the image of the beloved one in\r\nour minds; our fancy follows it, acting and being acted upon in ways in\r\nwhich we have no share.  Our sympathy is at fault, or we conceive it to\r\nbe so; and doubt and trouble creep over us, we scarcely know why.\r\nThough the letters which come may be natural and hearty, as of old,\r\nbreathing the very spirit of our friend, we feel a sort of surprise at\r\nthe handwriting being quite familiar.  We look forward with a kind of\r\ntimidity to meeting, and fear there may be some restraint in it.  When\r\nthe hour of meeting comes, there is the very same face, the line of the\r\ncheek, the trick of the lip, the glance of the eye; the rise and fall of\r\nthe voice are the same; and the intense familiarity makes our very\r\nspirit swim in joy.  We are amazed at our previous fancy--we laugh at\r\nthe solemn stiffness in which our friend stood before our mind\'s eye,\r\nand to relieve which we had striven to recall the ludicrous situations\r\nand merry moods, in which that form and that face had been seen; and\r\nperhaps we have no peace till we have acknowledged to the beloved one\r\nthe ingenuity of our self-tormentings.  Is there a girl whose heart is\r\nwith her brother at college, who does not feel this regularly as the\r\nvacation comes round?  Is there a parent whose child is reaping honours\r\nin the field of life, and returning childlike from time to time, to rest\r\nin the old country-home--is there such a parent who is not conscious of\r\nthe misgiving and the re-assurance, as often as the absence and the\r\nre-union occur?  Is there even the most trustful of wives, whose husband\r\nis on the other side of the globe, that is wholly undisturbed by the\r\ntransmutation of the idol in her mind?  When the husband is returning,\r\nand her hungry heart is feasting on the anticipation of his appearance,\r\nshe may revel in the thought--\r\n\r\n  "And will I see his face again,\r\n  And will I hear him speak?"\r\n\r\nBut it is not till that vivid face and that piercing voice thrill her\r\nsight and her ear again that all misgiving vanishes.  There is nothing\r\nin life that can compensate for long partings.  There ought to be few or\r\nno insurmountable obstacles to the frequent meetings, however short, of\r\nthose who love each other.  No duties and no privileges can be of more\r\nimportance than the preservation, in all their entireness, of domestic\r\nfamiliarity and faith.\r\n\r\nA very short separation will afford the experience of a long one, if it\r\nbe full of events, or if the image of the absent one be dwelt upon, from\r\nhour to hour, with laborious strivings of the fancy.  It has been said\r\nthat this week of Hester\'s absence was the longest that Margaret had\r\never known.  Besides this, she felt that she had forgotten her sister\r\nfurther than she could have supposed possible after a ten years\'\r\nseparation.  On the evening when she was expecting the travellers home,\r\nher heart was sick with expectation; and yet she was conscious of a\r\ntimidity which made her feel as if alone in the world.  Again and again\r\nshe looked round her, to fancy what would be the aspect, of everything\r\nto Hester\'s eye.  She wandered about the house to see once more that all\r\nwas in its right place, and every arrangement in due order.  She watched\r\nthe bright drawing-room fire nervously, and made herself anxious about\r\nthe tea-table, and sat upright on the sofa, listening for the sound of\r\nhorses\' feet in the snowy street, as if it had been a solemn stranger\r\nthat she was expecting, instead of her own sister Hester, with whom she\r\nhad shared all her heart, and spent all her days.  But a small part of\r\nthis anxiety was given to Mr Hope: she retained her image of him\r\nunperplexed, as a treasure of a brother, and a man with a mind so\r\nhealthy that he was sure to receive all things rightly, and be pleased\r\nand satisfied, happen what might.\r\n\r\nThey came; and Hester\'s spring from the carriage, and her husband\'s way\r\nof rubbing his hands over the fire, put all Margaret\'s anxieties to\r\nflight.  How sweet was the welcome!  How delicious the contest about\r\nwhich was to give the welcome to this, the lasting home of the three--\r\nwhether she who had put all in order for them, or they who claimed to\r\nhave the charge of her!  Margaret\'s eyes overflowed when Hester led her\r\nto Edward for his brotherly kiss.  Mr Hope\'s mind was disturbed for one\r\nsingle moment that he had not given this kiss with all the heartiness\r\nand simplicity of a brother; but the feeling was gone almost before he\r\nwas conscious of it.\r\n\r\nThe fire crackled, the kettle sang, Hester took her own place at once at\r\nthe tea-board, and her husband threw himself on the sofa, after\r\nascertaining that there were no family letters for him.  He knew that it\r\nwas impossible that there should be any in answer to the announcement of\r\nhis marriage.  Even Anne\'s could not arrive these four or five days yet.\r\nHe desired Margaret not to tell him at present if there were any\r\nmessages for him; for, if all Deerbrook had colds, he had no inclination\r\nto go out to-night to cure them.  There was a long list of messages,\r\nMargaret said, but they were in the surgery; and the pupil there might\r\nbring them in, if he thought proper: they should not be sent for.  This\r\none evening might be stolen for home and comfort.  Their journey had\r\nbeen delightful.  Oxford was more splendid than Hester had had an idea\r\nof.  Every facility had been afforded them for seeing it, and Mr Hope\'s\r\nacquaintances there had been as kind as possible.  The fall of snow had\r\nnot put them in any danger, and the inconveniences it had caused were\r\nrather stimulating to people who had travelled but little.  Hester had\r\nhad to get out of the carriage twice; and once she had walked a mile,\r\nwhen the driver had been uncertain about the road; but as Mrs Grey had\r\nhad the foresight to cause a pair of snow boots to be put into the\r\ncarriage at the last moment, no harm had happened,--not even to the\r\nwetting of feet; only enough inconvenience to make them glad to be now\r\nby their snug fireside.  Hester was full of mirth and anecdote.  She\r\nseemed to have been pleased with everybody and awake to everything.  As\r\nher sister looked upon her brow, now open as a sleeping child\'s, upon\r\nthe thick curl of glossy brown hair, and upon the bright smile which\r\nlighted up her exquisite face, she was amazed at herself for having\r\nperplexed such an image with apprehensive fancies.\r\n\r\nHow had Margaret spent her week?  Above all, it was to be hoped she had\r\nnot fatigued herself in their service.  There were four days\' grace yet\r\nfor preparation, before they should receive their company.  Margaret\r\nshould not have worked so hard.  Had Maria Young come yesterday?  Dear\r\nMaria! she must often come.  Should not the Greys be asked to dine in a\r\nquiet way, before any one else was admitted into the house?  Was it not\r\ndue to them?  But could the footboy wait at table?  Would it be possible\r\nto bring him into such training as would prevent Mrs Grey\'s being too\r\nmuch shocked at their way of getting through dinner?  Or was there any\r\none in Deerbrook who went out as a waiter?  Morris must be consulted;\r\nbut they must have the Greys to dinner before Monday.  How was Mrs\r\nEnderby?  Was her illness really thought serious, or was it only Mrs\r\nRowland\'s way of talking, which was just the same, whether Mrs Enderby\r\nhad a twinge of rheumatism or one of her frightful attacks?  Was Mr\r\nEnderby coming?--that was the chief point.  If he did not appear, it was\r\ncertain that he could not be feeling uneasy about his mother.  Margaret\r\nblushed when she replied that she had not heard of Mr Enderby\'s being\r\nexpected.  She could not but blush; for the conversation with Maria came\r\nfull into her mind.  Mr Hope saw the blush, and painfully wondered that\r\nit sent trouble through his soul.\r\n\r\nHow were Morris and the new maid likely to agree?  Did Morris think the\r\ngirl promising?  Surely it was time to take some notice of the servants.\r\nEdward would ring the bell twice, the signal for Morris; and Morris\r\nshould introduce the other two into the parlour.  They came, Morris in\r\nher best gown, and with her wedding ribbon on.  When she had shaken\r\nhands with her master and mistress, and spoken a good word for her\r\nfellow-servants, as she called them, the ruddy-faced girl appeared, her\r\ncheeks many shades deeper than usual, and her cap quillings standing off\r\nlike the rays on a sign-post picture of the sun.  Following her came the\r\nboy, feeling awkward in his new clothes, and scraping with his left leg\r\ntill the process was put a stop to by his master\'s entering into\r\nconversation with him.  Hester\'s beauty was really so striking, as with\r\na blushing bashfulness, she for the first time enacted the mistress\r\nbefore her husband\'s eyes, that it was impossible not to observe it.\r\nMargaret glanced towards her brother, and they exchanged smiles.  But\r\nthe effect of Margaret\'s smile was that Mr Hope\'s died away, and left\r\nhim grave.\r\n\r\n"Brother!" said Margaret; "what is the true story belonging to that\r\ngreat book about the Polar Sea, that you see lying there?"\r\n\r\n"How do you mean?  Is there any story belonging to it at all?"\r\n\r\n"Three at least; and Deerbrook has been so hot about it--"\r\n\r\n"You should send round the book to cool them.  It is enough to freeze\r\none to look at the plates of those polar books."\r\n\r\n"Sending round the book is exactly the thing I wanted to do, and could\r\nnot.  Mrs Rowland insists that Mrs Enderby ordered it in; and Mrs\r\nGrey demands to have it first; and Mr Rowland is certain that you\r\nbespoke it before anybody else.  I was afraid of the responsibility of\r\nacting in so nice a case.  An everlasting quarrel might come out of it:\r\nso I covered it, and put in the list, all ready to be sent at a moment\'s\r\nwarning; and then I amused myself with it while you were away.  Now,\r\nbrother, what will you do?"\r\n\r\n"The truth of the matter is, that I ordered it in myself, as Mr Rowland\r\nsays.  But Mrs Enderby shall have it at once, because she is ill.  It\r\nis a fine large type for her; and she will pore over the plates, and\r\nforget Deerbrook and all her own ailments, in wondering how the people\r\nwill get out of the ice."\r\n\r\n"Do you remember, Margaret," said Hester, "how she looked one summer\r\nday,--like a ghost from the grave,--when she came down from her books,\r\nand had even forgotten her shawl?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, about the battle!" cried Margaret, laughing.\r\n\r\n"What battle?" asked Hope.  "An historical one, I suppose, and not that\r\nof the Rowlands and Greys.  Mrs Enderby is of a higher order than the\r\nrest of us Deerbrook people: she gets most of her news, and all her\r\nbattles, out of history."\r\n\r\n"Yes: she alighted among us to tell us that such a great, such a\r\nwonderful battle had been fought, at a place called Blenheim, by the\r\nDuke of Marlborough, who really seemed a surprisingly clever man: it was\r\nsuch a good thought of his to have a swamp at one end of his line, and\r\nto put some of his soldiers behind some bushes, so that the enemy could\r\nnot get at them! and he won the battle."\r\n\r\n"This book will be the very thing for her," said Margaret.  "It is only\r\na pity that it did not come in at Midsummer instead of Christmas.  I am\r\nafraid she will sympathise so thoroughly that Phoebe will never be able\r\nto put on coals enough to warm her."\r\n\r\n"Nay," said Mr Hope, "it is better as it is.  She must be told now, at\r\nall events: whereas, if this book came to her at Midsummer, it would\r\nchill her whole month of July.  She would start every time she looked\r\nout of her window, and saw the meadows green."\r\n\r\n"I hope she is not really very ill," said Hester.\r\n\r\n"You were thinking the same thought that I was," said her husband,\r\nstarting up from the sofa.  "It is certainly my business to go and see\r\nher to-night, if she wishes it.  I will step down into the surgery, and\r\nlearn if there is any message from her."\r\n\r\n"And if there is not from her, there will be from some one else," said\r\nHester, sorrowfully.  "What a cold night for you to go out, and leave\r\nthis warm room!"\r\n\r\nMr Hope laughed as he observed what an innocent speech that was for a\r\nsurgeon\'s wife.  It was plain that her education in that capacity had\r\nnot begun.  And down he went.\r\n\r\n"Here are some things for you, cards and notes," said Margaret to her\r\nsister, as she opened a drawer of the writing-table: "one from Mrs\r\nGrey, marked `Private.\'  I do not suppose your husband may not see it;\r\nbut that is your affair.  My duty is to give it you privately."\r\n\r\n"One of the Grey mysteries, I suppose," said Hester, colouring, and\r\ntearing open the letter with some vehemence: "These mysteries were\r\nfoolish enough before; they are ridiculous now.  So, you are going out?"\r\ncried she, as her husband came in with his hat on.\r\n\r\n"Yes; the old lady will be the easier for my seeing her this evening;\r\nand I shall carry her the Polar Sea.  Where is pen and ink, Margaret?\r\nWe do not know the ways of our own house yet."\r\n\r\nMargaret brought pen and ink; and while Mr Hope wrote down the dates in\r\nthe Book Society\'s list, Hester exclaimed against Mrs Grey for having\r\nsent her a letter marked "Private," now that she was married.\r\n\r\n"If you mean it not to be private, you shall tell me about it when I\r\ncome back," said her husband.  "If I see Mrs Enderby to-night, I must\r\nbe gone."\r\n\r\nIt was not twenty minutes before he was seated by his own fireside\r\nagain.  His wife looked disturbed; and was so; she even forgot to\r\ninquire after Mrs Enderby.\r\n\r\n"There is Mrs Grey\'s precious letter!" said she.  "She may mean to be\r\nvery kind to me: I dare say she does: but she might know that it is not\r\nkindness to write so of my husband."\r\n\r\n"I do not see that she writes any harm of me, my dear," said he, laying\r\nthe letter open upon the table.  "She only wants to manage me a little:\r\nand that is her way, you know."\r\n\r\n"So exceedingly impertinent!" cried Hester, turning to Margaret.  "She\r\nwants me to use my influence, quietly, and without betraying her, to\r\nmake my husband--," she glanced into her husband\'s face, and checked her\r\ncommunication.  "In short," she said, "Mrs Grey wants to be meddling\r\nbetween my husband and one of his patients."\r\n\r\n"Well, what then?" said Margaret.\r\n\r\n"What then?  Why, if she is to be interfering already in our affairs--if\r\nshe is to be always fancying that she has anything to do with Edward,--\r\nand we living so near,--I shall never be able to bear it."\r\n\r\nAnd Hester\'s eyes overflowed with tears.\r\n\r\n"My dear! is it possible?" cried Edward.  "Such a trifle--."\r\n\r\n"It is no trifle," said Hester, trying to command her voice; "it can\r\nnever be a trifle to me that any one shows disrespect to you.  I shall\r\nnever be able to keep terms with any one who does."\r\n\r\nMargaret believed that nothing would be easier than to put a stop to any\r\nsuch attempts--if indeed they were serious.  Mrs Grey was so fond of\r\nHester that she would permit anything from her; and it would be easy for\r\nHester to say that, not wishing to receive any exclusively private\r\nletters, she had shown Mrs Grey\'s to her husband, though to no one\r\nelse: and that it was to be the principle of the family not to\r\ninterfere, more or less, with Mr Hope\'s professional affairs.\r\n\r\n"Or, better still, take no notice of the matter in any way whatever,\r\nthis time," said Mr Hope.  "We can let her have her way while we keep\r\nour own, cannot we?  So, let us put the mysterious epistle into the\r\nfire--shall we?  I wait your leave," said he, laughing, as he held the\r\nletter over the flame.\r\n\r\n"It is your property."\r\n\r\nHester signed to have it burned; but she could not forget it.  She\r\nrecurred to Mrs Grey, again and again.  "So near as they lived," she\r\nsaid--"so much as they must be together."\r\n\r\n"The nearer we all live, and the more we must be with our neighbours,"\r\nsaid her husband, "the more important it is that we should allow each\r\nother our own ways.  You will soon find what it is to live in a village,\r\nmy love; and then you will not mind these little trifles."\r\n\r\n"If they would meddle only with me," said Hester, "I should not mind.  I\r\nhope you do not think I should care so much for anything they could say\r\nor do about me.  If they only would let you alone--"\r\n\r\n"That is the last thing we can expect," said Margaret.  "Do they let any\r\npublic man alone?  Dr Levitt, or Mr James?"\r\n\r\n"Or the parish clerk?" added Mr Hope.  "It was reported lately that\r\nsteps were to be taken to intimate to Owen, that it was a constant habit\r\nof his to cough as he took his seat in the desk.  I was told once\r\nmyself, that it was remarked throughout Deerbrook that I seemed to be\r\nhalf whistling as I walked up the street in the mornings; and that it\r\nwas considered a practice too undignified for my profession."\r\n\r\nHester\'s colour rose again.  Margaret laughed, and asked:\r\n\r\n"What did you do?"\r\n\r\n"I made my best bow, and thought no more about the matter, till events\r\nbrought it to mind again at this moment.  So, Hester, suppose we think\r\nno more of Mrs Grey\'s hints?"  Seeing that her brow did not entirely\r\nclear, he took his seat by her, saying:\r\n\r\n"Supposing, love, that her letter does not show enough deference to my\r\nimportant self to satisfy you, still it remains that we owe respect to\r\nMrs Grey.  She is one of my oldest, and most hospitable, and faithful\r\nfriends here; and I need say nothing of her attachment to you.  Cannot\r\nwe overlook in her one little error of judgment?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, certainly," said Hester, cheerfully.  "Then I will say nothing\r\nto her unless she asks; and then tell her, as lightly as I may, what\r\nMargaret proposed just now.  So be it."\r\n\r\nAnd all was bright and smooth again--to all appearance.  But this little\r\ncloud did not pass away without leaving its gloom in more hearts than\r\none.  As Margaret set down her lamp on her own writing-table, and sank\r\ninto the chair of whose ease she had bidden Maria make trial, she might\r\nhave decided, if she had happened at the moment to remember the\r\nconversation, that the pleasure of solitude does depend much on the ease\r\nof the thoughts.  She sat long, wondering how she could have overlooked\r\nthe obvious probability that Hester, instead of finding the habit of\r\nmind of a lifetime altered by the circumstances of love and marriage,\r\nwould henceforth suffer from jealousy for her husband in addition to the\r\nburden she had borne for herself.  Long did Margaret sit there, turning\r\nher voluntary musings on the joy of their meeting, and the perfect\r\npicture of comfort which their little party had presented; but\r\nperpetually recurring, against her will, to the trouble which had\r\nsucceeded, and following back the track of this cloud, to see whether\r\nthere were more in the wind--whether it did not come from a horizon of\r\nstorm.\r\n\r\nYet hers was not the most troubled spirit in the house.  Hester\'s\r\nvexation had passed away, and she was unconscious, as sufferers of her\r\nclass usually are, of the disturbance she had caused.  She presently\r\nslept and was at peace.  Not so her husband.  A strange trouble--a\r\nfearful suspicion had seized upon him.  He was amazed at the return of\r\nhis feelings about Margaret, and filled with horror when he thought of\r\nthe days, and months, and years of close domestic companionship with\r\nher, from which there was no escape.  There was no escape.  The peace of\r\nhis wife, of Margaret--his own peace in theirs--depended wholly on the\r\ndeep secrecy in which he should preserve the mistake he had made.  It\r\nwas a mistake.  He could scarcely endure the thought; but it was so.\r\nFor some months, he had never had a doubt that he was absolutely in the\r\nroad of duty; and, if some apprehension about his entire happiness had\r\nchilled him, from time to time, he had cast them off, as inconsistent\r\nwith the resolution of his conscience.  Now he feared, he felt he had\r\nmistaken his duty.  As, in the stillness of the night, the apprehension\r\nassailed him, that he had thrown away the opportunity and the promise of\r\nhis life--that he had desecrated his own home, and doomed to withering\r\nthe best affections of his nature, he for the moment wished himself\r\ndead.  But his was a soul never long thrown off its balance.  He\r\nconvinced himself, in the course of a long sleepless night, that\r\nwhatever might have been his errors, his way was now clear, though\r\ndifficult.  He must devote himself wholly to her whose devotion to him\r\nhad caused him his present struggles; and he must trust that, if\r\nMargaret did not ere long remove from the daily companionship which must\r\nbe his sorest trial, he should grow perpetually stronger in his\r\nself-command.  Of one thing he was certain--that no human being\r\nsuspected the real state of his mind.  This was a comfort and support.\r\nOf something else he felt nearly certain--that Margaret loved Philip.\r\nThis was another comfort, if he could only feel it so; and he had little\r\ndoubt that Philip loved her.  He had also a deep conviction, which he\r\nnow aroused for his support--that no consecration of a home is so holy\r\nas that of a kindly, self-denying, trustful spirit in him who is the\r\nhead and life of his house.  If there was in himself a love which must\r\nbe denied, there was also one which might be indulged.  Without\r\ntrammelling himself with vows, he cheered his soul with the image of the\r\nlife he might yet fulfil, shedding on all under his charge the blessings\r\nof his activity, patience, and love; and daily casting off the burden of\r\nthe day, leaving all care for the morrow to such as, happier than\r\nhimself, would have the future the image of the present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVENTEEN.\r\n\r\nFIRST HOSPITALITY.\r\n\r\nThe Greys needed only to be asked to come and dine before the rest of\r\nthe world could have an opportunity of seeing the bride and bridegroom.\r\nThey had previously settled among themselves that they should be\r\ninvited, and the answer was given on the instant.  The only doubt was\r\nhow far down in the family the pleasure ought to extend.  Sydney was\r\nfull of anxiety about it.  His mother decided that he ought to be asked,\r\nbut that perhaps he had better not go, as he would be in the way; and\r\nSophia was sure it would be very dull for him; a sentence which made\r\nSydney rather sulky.  But Hester insisted on having him, and pleaded\r\nthat William Levitt would come and meet him, and if the lads should find\r\nthe drawing-room dull, there was the surgery, with some very curious\r\nthings in it, where they might be able to amuse themselves.  So Sydney\r\nwas to take up his lot with the elderly ones, and the little girls were\r\nto be somewhat differently entertained another day.\r\n\r\nOh, the anxieties of a young wife\'s first dinner-party!  If remembered,\r\nthey become laughable enough when looked back upon from future years;\r\nbut they are no laughing matter at the time.  The terror lest there\r\nshould be too little on the table, and the consequent danger of there\r\nbeing too much: the fear at once of worrying the cook with too many\r\ndirections, and leaving any necessary thing unsaid: the trembling doubt\r\nof any power of entertainment that may exist in the house; the\r\nanticipation of a yawn on the part of any guest, or of such a silence as\r\nmay make the creaking of the footboy\'s shoes heard at dinner, or the\r\nstriking of the hall clock in the evening--these are the apprehensions\r\nwhich make the young wife wish herself on the other side of her first\r\ndinner-party, and render alluring the prospect of sitting down next day\r\nto hash or cold fowl, followed by odd custards and tartlets, with a\r\nstray mince-pie.  Where a guest so experienced and so vigilant as Mrs\r\nGrey is expected, the anxiety is redoubled, and the servants are sure to\r\ndiscover it by some means or other.  Morris woke, this Saturday morning,\r\nwith the feeling that something great was to happen that day; and Sally\r\nbegan to be sharp with the footboy as early as ten o\'clock.  Hester and\r\nMargaret were surprised to find how soon there was nothing more left for\r\nthem to do.  The wine was decanted, the dessert dished up in the little\r\nstoreroom, and even the cake cut for tea, soon enough to leave almost\r\nthe whole morning to be spent as usual.  Margaret sat down to study\r\nGerman, and Hester to read.  She had just observed that they could not\r\nexpect to see Edward for some hours, as he had been sent for to the\r\nalmshouses, and meant to pay a country visit which would cost him a\r\ncircuit on his return.  These almshouses were six miles off; and when\r\nMr Hope was sent for by one of the inmates, nearly all the rest were\r\nwont to discover that they ailed more or less; so that their medical\r\nguardian found it no easy matter to get away, and his horse had learned,\r\nby practice, to stand longer there than anywhere else without fidgeting.\r\nKnowing this, Margaret fully agreed to her sister\'s proposition, that\r\nit must be some hours before Edward could appear.  In a little while,\r\nhowever, Hester threw down her book, and took up her work, laying her\r\nwatch just under her eyes upon the table.\r\n\r\n"Do you mean to do that for life, when your husband takes a country\r\nride?" said Margaret, laughing.\r\n\r\n"I hate these everlasting country rides!" cried Hester.  "I do wish he\r\nwould give up those almshouses."\r\n\r\n"Give them up!"\r\n\r\n"Yes: they are nothing but trouble and anxiety.  The old folks are never\r\nsatisfied, and never would be, if he lived among them, and attended to\r\nnobody else.  And as often as he goes there, he is sure to be more\r\nwanted here than at any other time.  There is another knock.  There have\r\nbeen two people wanting him within this hour; and a country gentleman\r\nhas left word that he shall call with his daughter at one o\'clock."\r\n\r\n"Well, let them come.  If he is home, well and good; if not, they must\r\nwait till he arrives."\r\n\r\nHester started up, and walked about the room.\r\n\r\n"I know what is in your mind," said Margaret.  "The truth is, you are\r\nafraid of another accident.  I do not wonder at it; but, dearest Hester,\r\nyou must control this fear.  Consider; supposing it to be Heaven\'s\r\npleasure that you and he should live for forty or fifty years together,\r\nwhat a world of anxiety you will inflict on yourself if you are to\r\nsuffer in this way every time he rides six miles out and back again!"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps I shall grow used to it: but I do wish he would give up those\r\nalmshouses."\r\n\r\n"Suppose we ask him to give up practice at once," said Margaret, "that\r\nwe may have him always with us.  No, no, Hester; we must consider him\r\nfirst, and ourselves next, and let him have his profession all to\r\nhimself, and as much of it as he likes."\r\n\r\n"Ourselves!" cried Hester, contemptuously.\r\n\r\n"Well, yourself, then," said Margaret, smiling.  "I only put myself in\r\nthat I might lecture myself at the same time with you."\r\n\r\n"Lecture away, dear," said Hester, "till you make me as reasonable as if\r\nI had no husband to care for."\r\n\r\nMargaret might have asked whether Hester had been reasonable when she\r\nhad had neither husband nor lover to care for; but, instead of this, she\r\nopened the piano, and tempted her sister away from her watch to practise\r\na duet.\r\n\r\n"I will tell you what I am thinking of," cried Hester, breaking off in\r\nthe middle of a bar of the second page.  "Perhaps you thought me hasty\r\njust now; but you do not know what I had in my head.  You remember how\r\nlate Edward was called out, the night before last?"\r\n\r\n"To Mrs Marsh\'s child?  Yes; it was quite dark when he went."\r\n\r\n"There was no moon.  Mr Marsh wanted to send a servant back with him as\r\nfar as the high-road: but he was sure he knew the way.  He was riding\r\nvery fast, when his horse suddenly stopped, and almost threw him over\r\nits head.  He spurred in vain; the animal only turned round and round,\r\ntill a voice called from somewhere near, `Stop there, for God\'s sake!\r\nWait till I bring a light.\'  A man soon came with a lantern, and where\r\ndo you think Edward found himself?  On the brink of a mill-dam!  Another\r\nstep in the dark night, and he might have been heard of no more!"\r\n\r\nMargaret was not at all surprised that Hester covered her face with her\r\nhands at the end of this very disagreeable anecdote.\r\n\r\n"It is clear," said she, "that Edward is the person who wants lecturing.\r\nWe must bid him not ride very fast on dark nights, on roads that he\r\ndoes not know.  But I have a high opinion of this horse of his.  One of\r\nthe two is prudent; and that is a great comfort.  And, for the present,\r\nthere is the consolation that there are no mill-dams in the way to the\r\nalmshouses, and that it is broad daylight.  So let us go on with our\r\nduet,--or shall we begin again?"\r\n\r\nHester played through the duet, and then sighed over a new\r\napprehension--that some of those old invalids would certainly be taking\r\nMr Hope away from home on the two mornings when their neighbours were\r\nto pay the wedding visit.  "And what shall we do then?" she inquired.\r\n\r\n"We shall see when the time comes," replied Margaret.  "Meanwhile we are\r\nsure of one good thing,--that Edward will not be called away from the\r\ndinner-table to-day by the almshouse people.  Come! let us play this\r\nover once more, that it may be ready for Mr Grey in the evening."\r\n\r\nSooner than he was looked for--sooner than it was supposed possible that\r\nhe could have come--Edward appeared.\r\n\r\n"Safe!" cried he, laughing: "what should prevent my being safe?  What\r\nsort of a soldier\'s or sailor\'s wife would you have made?" he asked,\r\nlooking in Hester\'s happy face.\r\n\r\n"She would be crazed with every gale, and die at `rumours of wars,\'"\r\nsaid Margaret: "mill-dams are horror enough for her--and, to say the\r\ntruth, brother, for other people, too, while you ride as you do."\r\n\r\n"That was an accident which cannot recur," observed Hope.  "I am sorry\r\nMr Marsh\'s man mentioned it.  But Hester--."\r\n\r\n"I see what you would say," sighed Hester; "your mention of soldiers\'\r\nand sailors\' wives reminds me.  I have no faith, I know: and I thought I\r\nshould when--.  Oh, I wonder how those old crusaders\' wives endured\r\ntheir lives!  But, perhaps, seven years\' suspense was easier to bear\r\nthan seven hours\'."\r\n\r\nHester joined in the laugh at this speech, and Edward went to see his\r\npatients in a place where there was really no danger--in the\r\nwaiting-room.  Yet Hester was a little ruffled when the Greys appeared.\r\nSo many messages had arrived for Edward, that the country gentleman and\r\nhis daughter had been kept waiting, and a livery servant had called\r\ntwice, as if impatient.  She was afraid that people would blame Edward--\r\nthat he would never manage to satisfy them all.  Her colour was raised,\r\nand her brow slightly bent, when her guests entered; but all was right\r\nwhen Edward followed, looking perfectly at leisure, and stood talking\r\nbefore the fire, as if he had been a man of no profession.\r\n\r\nMr Hope had caused his feelings to be so well understood on one\r\nimportant subject, that it was necessary to respect them; and no mention\r\nof the Rowlands was made, either before dinner or in the presence of the\r\nservants.  Nor was there any need of the topic.  There was abundance to\r\nbe said, without having recourse to doubtful subjects; and Margaret\r\nbecame so far relieved from all apprehension on this account, by the\r\ntime the cheese appeared, that she assured herself that the day was\r\npassing off extremely well.  There had not been a single pause left to\r\nbe filled up with the clatter of knives and forks.  Mrs Grey pronounced\r\nthe room delightfully warm; Sophia protested that she liked having the\r\nfire at her back; and Mr Grey inquired where Hope got his ale.  The\r\nboys, who had looked for the first half-hour as if they could not speak\r\nfor the stiffness of their collars, were now in a full career of jokes,\r\nto judge by their stifled laughter.  Hester blushed beautifully at every\r\nlittle circumstance that occurred, and played the hostess very\r\ngracefully.  The day was going off extremely well.\r\n\r\nThe approaching county election was the principal topic at dinner, as it\r\nwas probably at every dinner-table in Deerbrook.  Mrs Grey first told\r\nHope, at the bottom of the table, all about her wonder at seeing seven\r\nor eight gentlemen on horseback entering their field.  She was\r\nexceedingly surprised to observe such a troop approaching the door: and\r\nshe hardly knew what to make of it when the servant came in to say that\r\nthe gentlemen wished to see her, as Mr Grey was at a distance--at\r\nmarket that day.  It was strange that she should so entirely forget that\r\nthere was to be an election soon.  To be sure, it might have occurred to\r\nher that the party came to canvass Mr Grey: but she did not happen to\r\nremember at first; and she thought the gentleman who was spokesman\r\nexcessively complimentary, both about the place and about some other\r\nthings, till he mentioned his name, and that he was candidate for the\r\ncounty.  Such a highly complimentary strain was not to her taste, she\r\nacknowledged; and it lost all its value when it was made so common as in\r\nthis instance.  This gentleman had kissed the little Rowlands all round,\r\nshe had since been assured:--not that she wished to enlarge on that\r\nsubject; but it only showed what gentlemen will do when they are\r\ncanvassing.  The other candidate, Mr Lowry, seemed a very high\r\npersonage indeed.  When he found Mr Grey was not at home, he and all\r\nhis party rode straight on, without inquiring for the ladies.  Everyone\r\nseemed to think that Mr Lowry was not likely to carry his election, his\r\nmanners were so extremely high.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Mr Grey was observing to his hostess that he was sorry to\r\nfind there was an election impending.  People in a small place like\r\nDeerbrook were quite apt enough to quarrel, day by day;--an election\r\nthrew the place into an uproar.\r\n\r\n"`How delightful!\' those boys are thinking," said Hester, laughing.\r\n\r\n"I am sure," said Sophia, "it is anything but delightful to me.  I\r\nremember, last time, Sydney brought some squibs into the garden, and let\r\nthem off while mamma and I were in the shrubbery; and we could none of\r\nus get to sleep till after midnight for the light of the bonfire down\r\nthe street."\r\n\r\n"They should manage those things more quietly," observed Mr Grey.\r\n"This time, however, there will be only a little effusion of joy, and\r\nthen an end; for they say Ballinger will carry every vote in the place."\r\n\r\n"Why, father!" cried Sydney, "are you going to vote for Ballinger this\r\ntime?"\r\n\r\n"No, my boy.  I did not say so.  I shall not vote at all," he added,\r\nobserving that he was expected to explain himself.  No remark being\r\nmade, he continued--"It will not be convenient to me to meddle in\r\nelection matters this time; and it would be of no use, as Lowry has not\r\nthe slightest chance.  One gets nothing but ill-will and trouble by\r\nmeddling.  So, my dear," turning to Hester, "your husband and I will\r\njust keep quiet, and let Deerbrook have its own way."\r\n\r\n"I believe you may speak for yourself," replied Hester, her eyes\r\nsparkling.  "Edward has no idea--."  Then, remembering that she was\r\nspeaking to a guest, she cut short her assurance that Edward had no idea\r\nof neglecting his duty when it was wanted most, for such a reason as\r\nthat it was then most irksome.\r\n\r\n"There is no occasion in the world for your husband to come forward,"\r\nobserved Mr Grey, with kind anxiety.  "I was saying, Hope, that you are\r\nquite absolved from interfering in politics.  Nobody expects it from a\r\nmedical man.  Everyone knows the disadvantage to a professional man,\r\ncircumstanced like you, of taking any side in a party matter.  You might\r\nfind the consequences very serious, I assure you."\r\n\r\n"And nobody expects it of a medical man," echoed Mrs Grey.\r\n\r\nMr Hope did not reply, that he voted for other reasons than that it was\r\nexpected of him.  He had argued the subject with Mr Grey before, and\r\nknew that they must agree to differ.  He quietly declared his intention\r\nof voting for Mr Lowry, and then asked Sophia to take wine.  His manner\r\nleft no resource to Mrs Grey but to express her feelings to his wife in\r\nthe drawing-room, after dinner.\r\n\r\nShe there drew Hester\'s arm within her own, and kindly observed what\r\npleasure it gave her to see her anticipations so fulfilled.  She had had\r\nthis home, fitted up and inhabited as it now was, in her mind\'s eye for\r\na longer time than she should choose to tell.  Elderly folks might be\r\nallowed to look forward, and Mr Grey could bear witness that she had\r\ndone so.  It was delightful to look round and see how all had come to\r\npass.\r\n\r\n"Everybody is so interested!" observed Sophia.  "Mrs Howell says, some\r\nhave observed to her what a pity it is that you are dissenters, so that\r\nyou will not be at church on Sunday.  Everybody would be sure to be\r\nthere: and she says she is of opinion that, considering how many friends\r\nwish to see you make your first appearance, you ought to go, for once.\r\nShe cannot imagine what harm it could do you to go for once.  But,\r\nwhatever you may think about that, it shows her interest, and I thought\r\nyou would like to know it.  Have you seen Mrs Howell\'s window?"\r\n\r\n"My dear! how should they?" exclaimed her mother.\r\n\r\n"I forgot they could not go out before Sunday.  But, Margaret you must\r\nlook at Mrs Howell\'s window the first thing when you can get out.  It\r\nis so festooned with purple and white, that I told Miss Miskin I thought\r\nthey would be obliged to light up in the daytime, they have made the\r\nshop so dark."\r\n\r\n"And they have thrust all the green and orange into the little side\r\nwindow, where nobody can see it!" cried Sydney.\r\n\r\n"You managed to see it, I perceive," said Hester; Sydney having at the\r\nmoment mounted a cockade, and drawn out his green and orange\r\nwatch-ribbon into the fullest view.  William Levitt lost no time in\r\ngoing through the same process with his purple and white.\r\n\r\n"You will be the ornaments of Deerbrook," said Margaret, "if you walk\r\nabout in that gay style.  I hope I shall have the pleasure of meeting\r\nyou both in the street, that I may judge of the effect."\r\n\r\n"They will have lost their finery by that time," said Sophia.  "We had a\r\nterrible snatching of cockades last time."\r\n\r\n"Snatching! let them try to snatch mine, and see what they\'ll get by\r\nit!" cried Sydney.\r\n\r\n"What would they get but the ribbons?" asked Margaret.  Sydney drew her\r\nto the light, opened the bows of his cockade, and displayed a\r\ncorking-pin stuck upright under each bow.\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t it horrid?" said Sophia.\r\n\r\n"Horrid!  It is not half so horrid as fish-hooks."\r\n\r\nAnd Sydney related how fish-hooks had actually been used during the last\r\nelection, to detain with their barbs the fingers of snatchers of\r\ncockades.  "Which do you use?" he asked of William Levitt.\r\n\r\n"Neither.  My father won\'t let me do anything more than just wear a\r\ncockade and watch-ribbon.  I have got a watch-guard too, you see, for\r\nfear of losing my watch.  But you won\'t get my cockade off a bit the\r\nsooner for my having no spikes under it.  I have a particular way of\r\nfastening it on.  Only try, any day.  I defy you to it."\r\n\r\n"Hush, hush, boys! don\'t talk of defiance," said Mrs Grey.  "I am sure,\r\nI wish there were no such things as elections--in country places, at\r\nleast.  They make nothing but mischief.  And, indeed, Hester, my dear,\r\nit is a great pity that those should meddle who can keep out of them, as\r\nyour husband fairly may.  Whichever way he might vote, a great many\r\ndisagreeable remarks would be made; and if he votes as he says, for Mr\r\nLowry, I really think, and so does Mr Grey, that it will be a serious\r\ninjury to him in his profession."\r\n\r\nHester replied, with some gravity, that people could never do their\r\nwhole duty without causing disagreeable remarks; and seldom without\r\nsuffering serious injury.\r\n\r\n"But why should he vote?" persisted Mrs Grey.\r\n\r\n"Because he considers it his duty, which is commonly his reason for\r\nwhatever he does."\r\n\r\n"An excellent reason too: but I rather thought--I always fancied he\r\ndefended acting from impulse.  But I beg your pardon, my dear:" and she\r\nnodded and winked towards the young people, who were trying the\r\nimpression of a new seal at the centre table, heeding nothing about\r\neither duty or impulse.  Margaret had fixed the attention of the boys\r\nupon this curious seal of hers, in order to obviate a snatching of\r\ncockades, or other political feud, upon the spot.\r\n\r\n"It seems as if I could speak about nothing but your husband, my dear,"\r\ncontinued Mrs Grey, in a whisper: "but you know I feel towards him as\r\ntowards a son, as I have told him.  Do you think he has quite, entirely,\r\ngot over his accident?"\r\n\r\n"Entirely, he thinks.  He calls himself in perfect health."\r\n\r\n"Well, he ought to know best; but--"\r\n\r\n"But what?" asked Hester, anxiously.\r\n\r\n"It has occurred to us, that he may still want watching and care.  It\r\nhas struck both Mr Grey and me, that he is not quite the same that he\r\nwas before that accident.  It is natural enough.  And yet I thought in\r\nthe autumn that he was entirely himself again: but there is still a\r\nlittle difference--a little flatness of spirits sometimes--a little more\r\ngravity than used to be natural to him."\r\n\r\n"But you do not think he looks ill?  Tell me just what you think."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, not ill; rather delicate, perhaps; but I am sure it is\r\nwonderful that he is so well after such an accident.  He calls himself\r\nperfectly well, does he?"\r\n\r\n"Perfectly."\r\n\r\n"Oh, then, we may be quite easy; for he must know best.  Do not let\r\nanything that I have said dwell upon your mind, my dear.  I only just\r\nthought I would ask."\r\n\r\nHow common it is for one\'s friends to drop a heavy weight upon one\'s\r\nheart, and then desire one not to let it dwell there!  Hester\'s spirits\r\nwere irrecoverably damped for this evening.  Her husband seemed to be an\r\naltered man, flat in spirits, and looking delicate, and she told not to\r\nbe uneasy!  She was most eager for the entrance of the gentlemen from\r\nthe dining-room, that she might watch him and, till they came, she had\r\nnot a word of amusement to furnish to her guests.  Margaret perceived\r\nthat something had gone wrong and talked industriously till reinforced\r\nfrom the dining-room.\r\n\r\nSophia whispered a hint to her mother to inquire particularly about Mrs\r\nEnderby\'s health.  At the mention of her name Mr Hope took his seat on\r\nthe sofa beside Mrs Grey, and replied gravely and fully--that he\r\nthought Mrs Enderby really very unwell--more so than he had ever known\r\nher.  She was occasionally in a state of great suffering, and any\r\nattention that her old friends could show her in the way of a quiet call\r\nwould be a true kindness.  Had he alarmed her family?  There was quite\r\nhint enough for alarm, he said, in the state in which her relations saw\r\nher at times.  But Mrs Rowland was always trying to make out that\r\nnothing was the matter with her mother: was it not so?  Not exactly so.\r\nMrs Rowland knew that there was no immediate danger--that her mother\r\nmight live many months, or even a few years; but Mr Hope believed\r\nneither Mrs Rowland, nor any one else, could deny her sufferings.\r\n\r\n"They say Mr Philip is coming," observed Mr Grey.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I hope he is!" cried Sydney, turning round to listen.\r\n\r\n"Some people say that he is otherwise occupied," observed Sophia, "If\r\nall accounts be true--" She caught her mother\'s eye, and stopped\r\nsuddenly and awkwardly.\r\n\r\nMr Hope involuntarily glanced at Margaret, as one or two others were\r\ndoing at the same time.  Nothing was to be discerned, for she was\r\nstooping over the volume of engravings that she was showing to William\r\nLevitt; and she remained stooping for a long while.\r\n\r\nWhen the proper amount of playing and singing had been gone through, and\r\nMrs Grey\'s sedan was announced the cloaked and muffled guest left\r\nbehind a not very happy party.  Margaret\'s gaiety seemed exhausted, and\r\nshe asked if it was not late.  Hester was gazing at her husband.  She\r\nsaw the perspiration on his brow.  She put her arm within his, and\r\nanxiously inquired whether he was not unwell.  She was sure he had never\r\nfully recovered his strength: she had not taken care enough of him: why\r\ndid he not tell her when he was weary and wanted nursing?\r\n\r\nMr Hope looked at her with an unaffected surprise, which went far to\r\nconsole her, and assured her that he was perfectly well; and that,\r\nmoreover, he was so fond of indulgence that she would be sure to hear of\r\nit, if ever he could find a pretence for getting upon the sofa.\r\n\r\nHester was comforted, but said that his spirits were not always what\r\nthey had been: and she appealed to Margaret.  Margaret declared that any\r\nfailure of spirits in Edward was such a new idea, that she must consider\r\nbefore she gave an answer.  She thought that he had been too busy to\r\ndraw so many caricatures as usual lately; but she had observed no deeper\r\nsigns of despondency than that.\r\n\r\n"Do not let us get into the habit of talking about spirits," said Hope.\r\n"I hear quite enough about that away from home; and I can assure you,\r\nprofessionally, that it is a bad subject to dwell upon.  Every one who\r\nlives has variations of spirits: they are like the sunshine, or like Dr\r\nLevitt\'s last sermon, of which Mrs Enderby says every Sunday in the\r\nchurch porch--`It is to be felt, not talked about.\'"\r\n\r\n"But, as a sign of health--" said Hester.\r\n\r\n"As a sign of health, my dear, the spirits of all this household may be\r\nleft to my professional discrimination.  Will you trust me, my dear?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes!" she uttered, with a sigh of relief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHTEEN.\r\n\r\nGRANDMAMMA IN RETREAT.\r\n\r\n"I am better now, Phoebe," said Mrs Enderby, sinking back faintly in\r\nher easy-chair, after one of her attacks of spasms.  "I am better now;\r\nand if you will fan me for a minute or two, I shall be quite fit to see\r\nthe children--quite delighted to have them."\r\n\r\n"I declare," said the maid, "here are the drops standing upon your face\r\nthis cold day, as if it was August!  But if the pain is cone, never mind\r\nanything else!  And I, for one, won\'t say anything against your having\r\nthe children in; for I\'m sure the seeing your friends has done you no\r\nharm, and nothing but good."\r\n\r\n"Pray, draw up the blind, Phoebe, and let me see something of the\r\nsunshine.  Bless me! how frosty the field looks, while I have been\r\nstifled with heat for this hour past!  I had better not go to the\r\nwindow, however, for I begin to feel almost chilly already.  Thank you,\r\nPhoebe; you have fanned me enough.  Now call the children, Phoebe."\r\n\r\nPhoebe wrapped a cloak about her mistress\'s knees, pinned her shawl up\r\ncloser around her throat, and went to call the children in from the\r\nparlour below.  Matilda drew up her head and flattened her back, and\r\nthen asked her grandmamma how she did.  George looked up anxiously in\r\nthe old lady\'s face.\r\n\r\n"Ah, George," said she, smiling; "it is an odd face to look at, is not\r\nit?  How would you like your face to look as mine does?"\r\n\r\n"Not at all," said George.\r\n\r\nMrs Enderby laughed heartily, and then told him that her face was not\r\nunlike his once--as round, and as red, and as shining in frosty weather.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps if you were to go out now into the frost, your face would look\r\nas it used to do."\r\n\r\n"I am afraid not.  When my face looked like yours, it was when I was a\r\nlittle girl, and used to slide and make snowballs as you do.  That was a\r\nlong time ago.  My face is wrinkled now, because I am old; and it is\r\npale, because I am ill."\r\n\r\nGeorge heard nothing after the word "snowballs."  "I wish some more snow\r\nwould come," he observed.  "We have plenty of ice down in the meadows,\r\nbut there has been only one fall of snow, and that melted almost\r\ndirectly."\r\n\r\n"Papa thinks there will be more snow very soon," observed Matilda.\r\n\r\n"If there is, you children can do something for me that I should like\r\nvery much," said grandmamma.  "Shall I tell you what it is?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"You can make a snow-man in that field.  I am sure Mr Grey will give\r\nyou leave."\r\n\r\n"What good will that do you?" asked Matilda.\r\n\r\n"I can sit here and watch you; and I shall like that exceedingly.  I\r\nshall see you gathering the snow, and building up your man: and if you\r\nwill turn about and shake your hand this way now and then, I shall be\r\nsure to observe it, and I shall think you are saying something kind to\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"I wish the snow would come," cried George, stamping with impatience.\r\n\r\n"I do not believe mamma will let us," observed Matilda.  "She prohibits\r\nour going into Mr Grey\'s field."\r\n\r\n"But she shall let us, that one time," cried George.  "I will ask papa,\r\nand Mr Grey, and Sydney, and Uncle Philip, and all.  When will Uncle\r\nPhilip come again?"\r\n\r\n"Some time soon, I dare say.  But, George, we must do as your mamma\r\npleases about my plan, you know.  If she does not wish you to go into\r\nMr Grey\'s field, you can make your snow-man somewhere else."\r\n\r\n"But then you won\'t see us.  But I know what I will do.  I will speak to\r\nSydney, and he and Fanny and Mary shall make you a snow-man yonder,\r\nwhere we should have made him."\r\n\r\nMrs Enderby pressed the boy to her, and laughed while she thanked him,\r\nbut said it was not the same thing seeing the Greys make a snow-man.\r\n\r\n"Why, George!" said Matilda, contemptuously.\r\n\r\n"When _will_ Uncle Philip come?" asked the boy, who was of opinion that\r\nUncle Philip could bring all things to pass.\r\n\r\n"Why, I will tell you how it is, my dear.  Uncle Philip is very busy\r\nlearning his lessons."\r\n\r\nThe boy stared.\r\n\r\n"Yes: grown-up people who mean to be great lawyers, as I believe Uncle\r\nPhilip does, have to learn lessons like little boys, only much longer\r\nand much harder."\r\n\r\n"When will he have done them?"\r\n\r\n"Not for a long while yet: but he will make a holiday some time soon,\r\nand come to see us.  I should like to get well before that.  Sometimes I\r\nthink I shall, and sometimes I think not."\r\n\r\n"Does he expect you will?"\r\n\r\n"He expects nothing about it.  He does not know that I am ill.  I do not\r\nwish that he should know it, my dears; so, when I feel particularly\r\nwell, and when I have heard anything that pleases me, I ask Phoebe to\r\nbring me the pen and ink, and I write to Uncle Philip."\r\n\r\n"And why does not mamma tell him how you are?"\r\n\r\n"Ah! why, indeed," muttered Phoebe.\r\n\r\n"She knows that I do not wish it.  Uncle Philip writes charming long\r\nletters to me, as I will show you.  Bring me my reticule.  Here--here is\r\na large sheet of paper, quite full, you see--under the seal and all.\r\nWhen will you write such long letters, I wonder?"\r\n\r\n"I shall when I am married, I suppose," said Matilda, again drawing up\r\nher little head.\r\n\r\n"You married, my love!  And pray when are you to be married?"\r\n\r\n"Mamma often talks of the time when she shall lose me, and of what\r\nthings have to be done while she has me with her."\r\n\r\n"There is a great deal to be done indeed, love, before that day, if it\r\never comes."\r\n\r\n"There are more ways than one of losing a child," observed Phoebe, in\r\nher straightforward way.  "If Mrs Rowland thinks so long beforehand of\r\nthe one way, it is to be hoped she keeps Miss Matilda up to the thought\r\nof the other, which must happen sooner or later, while marrying may\r\nnot."\r\n\r\n"Well, Phoebe," said the old lady, "we will not put any dismal thoughts\r\ninto this little head: time enough for that: we will leave all that to\r\nMiss Young."  Then, stroking Matilda\'s round cheek, she inquired, "My\r\nlove, did you ever in your life feel any pain?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear, yes, grandmamma: to be sure I have; twice.  Why, don\'t you\r\nremember, last spring, I had a dreadful pain in my head for nearly two\r\nhours, on George\'s birthday?  And last week, after I went to bed, I had\r\nsuch a pain in my arm, I did not know how to bear it."\r\n\r\n"And what became of it?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I found at last I could bear it no longer, and I began to think\r\nwhat I should do.  I meant to ring the bell, but I fell asleep."\r\n\r\nPhoebe laughed with very little ceremony, and grandmamma could not help\r\njoining.  She supposed Matilda hoped it might be long enough before she\r\nhad any more pain.  In the night-time, certainly, Matilda said.  And not\r\nin the daytime?  Is not pain as bad in the daytime?  Matilda\r\nacknowledged that she should like to be ill in the daytime.  Mamma took\r\nher on her lap when she was ill; and Miss Young was so very sorry for\r\nher; and she had something nice to drink.\r\n\r\n"Then I am afraid, my dear, you don\'t pity me at all," said grandmamma.\r\n"Perhaps you think you would like to live in a room like this, with a\r\nsofa and a screen, and Phoebe to wait upon you, and whatever you might\r\nfancy to eat and drink.  Would you like to be ill as I am?"\r\n\r\n"Not at present," said Matilda: "not till I am married.  I shall enjoy\r\ndoing as I like when I am married."\r\n\r\n"How the child\'s head runs upon being married!" said Phoebe.  "And to\r\nsuppose that being ill is doing as one likes, of all odd things!"\r\n\r\n"I should often like to fly all over the world," said Mrs Enderby, "and\r\nto get anywhere out of this room--I am so tired of it: but I know I\r\ncannot: so I get books, and read about all the strange places, far off,\r\nthat Mungo Park tells us about, and Gulliver, and Captain Parry.  And I\r\nshould often like to sleep at night when I cannot; and then I get up\r\nsoftly, without waking Phoebe, and look out at the bright stars, and\r\nthink over all we are told about them--about their being all full of men\r\nand women.  Did you know that, George?" asked she--George being now at\r\nthe window.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes," answered Matilda for him, "we know all about those things."\r\n\r\n"Are falling stars all full of men and women?" asked George.\r\n\r\n"There were none on a star that my father saw fall on the Dingleford\r\nroad," observed Phoebe.  "It wasn\'t big enough to hold men and women."\r\n\r\n"Did it fall in the middle of the road?" asked George, turning from the\r\nwindow.  "What was it like?"\r\n\r\n"It was a round thing, as big as a house, and all bright and crystal\r\nlike," said Phoebe, with absolute confidence.  "It blocked up the road\r\nfrom the great oak that you may remember, close by the second milestone,\r\nto the ditch on the opposite side."\r\n\r\n"Phoebe, are you sure of that?" asked Mrs Enderby, with a face full of\r\nanxious doubt.\r\n\r\n"Ma\'am, my father came straight home after seeing it fall, and he let my\r\nbrother John and me go the next morning early, to bring home some of the\r\nsplinters."\r\n\r\n"Oh, well," said Mrs Enderby, who always preferred believing to\r\ndoubting; "I have heard of stones falling from the moon."\r\n\r\n"This was a falling star, ma\'am."\r\n\r\n"Can you show me any of the splinters?" asked George, eagerly.\r\n\r\n"There was nothing whatsoever left of them," said Phoebe, "by the time\r\nJohn and I went.  We could not find a piece of crystal so big as my\r\nthimble.  My father has often laughed at John and me since, for not\r\nhaving been there in time, before it was all gone."\r\n\r\n"It is a good thing, my dears, depend upon it, as I was saying,"\r\nobserved Mrs Enderby, "to know all such things about the stars, and so\r\non, against the time when you cannot do as you like, and go where you\r\nplease.  Matilda, my jewel, when you are married, as you were talking\r\nabout, and can please yourself, you will take great care to be kind to\r\nyour mamma, my dear, if poor mamma should be old and ill.  You will\r\nalways wish to be tender to your mother, love, I am sure; and that will\r\ndo her more good than anything."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps mamma won\'t be ill," replied Matilda.\r\n\r\n"Then if she is never ill, she will certainly be old, some day; and then\r\nyou will be as kind to her as ever you can be,--promise me, my love.\r\nYour mamma loves you dearly, Matilda."\r\n\r\n"She says I dance better than any girl in Miss Anderson\'s school,\r\ngrandmamma.  I heard her tell Mrs Levitt so, yesterday."\r\n\r\n"Here comes mamma," said George, from the window.\r\n\r\n"Your mamma, my dear?  Phoebe, sweep up the hearth.  Hang that curtain\r\nstraight.  Give me that letter,--no, not that,--the large letter.\r\nThere! now put it into my knitting-basket.  Make haste down, Phoebe, to\r\nbe ready to open the door for Mrs Rowland.  Don\'t keep her waiting a\r\nmoment on the steps."\r\n\r\n"She has not got to the steps yet," said George.  "She is talking to\r\nMrs Grey.  Mrs Grey was coming here, and mamma went and spoke to her.\r\nOh, Matilda, come and look how they are nodding their bonnets at each\r\nother!  I think Mrs Grey is very angry, she wags her head about so.\r\nThere! now she is going away.  There she goes across the road! and mamma\r\nis coming up the steps."\r\n\r\nAfter a minute or two of silent expectation, Mrs Rowland entered her\r\nmother\'s room.  She brought with her a draught of wintry air, which, as\r\nshe jerked aside her ample silk cloak, on taking her seat on the sofa,\r\nseemed to chill the invalid, though there was now a patch of colour on\r\neach withered cheek.\r\n\r\n"How much better you look, ma\'am!" was the daughter\'s greeting.  "I\r\nalways thought it would be a pity to disturb Philip about you: and now,\r\nif he were to see you, he would not believe that you had been ill.  Mr\r\nRowland would be satisfied that I am right, I am sure, if he were to\r\ncome in."\r\n\r\n"My mistress is noways better," said Phoebe, bluntly.  "She is not the\r\nbetter for that flush she has got now, but the worse."\r\n\r\n"Never mind, Phoebe!  I shall do very well, I dare say," said Mrs\r\nEnderby, with a sigh.  "Well, my dear, how do you all go on at home?"\r\n\r\n"Much as usual, ma\'am.  But that reminds me--Matilda, my own love, Miss\r\nYoung must be wanting you for your lesson on objects.  Go, my dear."\r\n\r\n"I hoped Matilda was come for the day," said Mrs Enderby.  "I quite\r\nexpected she was to stay with me to-day.  Do let me have her, my dear:\r\nit will do me so much good."\r\n\r\n"You are very kind, ma\'am, but it is quite impossible.  It is totally\r\nout of the question, I assure you.  Matilda, my love, go this instant.\r\nWe make a great point of the lessons on objects.  Pray, Phoebe, tie Miss\r\nRowland\'s bonnet, and make haste."\r\n\r\nPhoebe did so, taking leave to observe that little girls were likely to\r\nlive long enough to know plenty of things after they had no grandmammas\r\nleft to be a comfort to.\r\n\r\nMrs Enderby struggled to say, "Hush, Phoebe;" but she found she could\r\nnot speak.  George was desired to go with his sister, and was scarcely\r\nallowed time to kiss his grandmamma.  While Phoebe was taking the\r\nchildren down stairs, Mrs Rowland wondered that some people allowed\r\ntheir servants to take such liberties as were taken; and gave notice\r\nthat though she tolerated Phoebe, because Phoebe\'s mistress had taken a\r\nfancy to her, she could not allow her family plans to be made a subject\r\nof remark to her mother\'s domestics.  Mrs Enderby had not quite decided\r\nupon her line of reply, when Phoebe came back, and occupied herself in\r\nsupplying her mistress, first with a freshly-heated footstool, and then\r\nwith a cup of arrowroot.\r\n\r\n"Where do you get your arrowroot, ma\'am?" asked Mrs Rowland.  "I want\r\nsome extremely for my poor dear Anna; and I can procure none that is at\r\nall to compare with yours."\r\n\r\n"Mrs Grey was so kind as to send me some, my dear; and it really is\r\nexcellent.  Phoebe, how much of it is there left?  I dare say there may\r\nbe enough for a cup or two for dear little Anna."\r\n\r\nPhoebe replied, that there was very little left--not any more than her\r\nmistress would require before she could grow stronger.  Mrs Rowland\r\nwould not take the rest of the arrowroot on any account: she was only\r\nwondering where Mrs Grey got it, and how it was that the Greys always\r\ncontrived to help themselves to the best of everything.  Phoebe was\r\ngoing to observe that they helped their neighbours to good things as\r\nwell as themselves; but a look from her mistress stopped her.  Mrs\r\nEnderby remarked that she had no doubt she could learn from Mrs Grey or\r\nSophia, the next time she saw either of them, where they procured their\r\narrowroot.  "It is a long time since I saw Mrs Grey," she observed,\r\ntimidly.\r\n\r\n"My dear ma\'am, how can you think of seeing any one in your present\r\nstate?" inquired the daughter.  "One need but see the flush in your\r\nface, to know that it would be highly improper for you to admit company.\r\nI could not take the responsibility of allowing it."\r\n\r\n"But Mrs Grey is not company, my love."\r\n\r\n"Any one is company to an invalid.  I assure you I prevented Mr\r\nRowland\'s coming for the reason I assign.  He was coming yesterday, but\r\nI would not let him."\r\n\r\n"I should like to see him, however.  And I should like to see Mrs Grey\r\ntoo."\r\n\r\nUnder pretence of arranging her mistress\'s shawl, Phoebe touched the old\r\nlady\'s shoulder, in token of intelligence.  Mrs Enderby was somewhat\r\nflurried at the liberty which she felt her maid had taken with her\r\ndaughter; but she could not notice it now; and she introduced another\r\nsubject.  Had everybody done calling on the Hopes?  Were the wedding\r\nvisits all over?  Oh, yes, Mrs Rowland was thankful to say; that fuss\r\nwas at an end at last.  One would think nobody had ever been married\r\nbefore, by the noise that had been made in Deerbrook about this young\r\ncouple.\r\n\r\n"Mr Hope is such a favourite!" observed Mrs Enderby.\r\n\r\n"He has been so; but it won\'t last.  I never saw a young man so gone off\r\nas he is.  He has not been like the same man since he connected himself\r\nwith the Greys so decidedly.  Surely, ma\'am, you must perceive that."\r\n\r\n"It had not occurred to me, my dear.  He comes very often, and he is\r\nalways extremely kind and very entertaining.  He brought his bride with\r\nhim yesterday, which I thought very attentive, as I could not go and pay\r\nmy respects to her.  And really, Priscilla, whether it was that I had\r\nnot seen her for some time, or that pretty young ladies look prettiest\r\nin an old woman\'s sick-room, I thought she was more beautiful than\r\never."\r\n\r\n"She is handsome," admitted Mrs Rowland.  "Poor thing! it makes one\r\nsorry for her, when one thinks what is before her."\r\n\r\n"What is before her?" ask Mrs Enderby, alarmed.\r\n\r\n"If she loves her husband at all, she must suffer cruelly in seeing him\r\nact as he persists in doing; and she must tremble in looking forward to\r\nthe consequences.  He is quite obstinate about voting for Mr Lowry,\r\nthough there is not a soul in Deerbrook to keep him in countenance; and\r\neverybody knows how strongly Sir William Hunter has expressed himself in\r\nfavour of Mr Ballinger.  It is thought the consequences will be very\r\nserious to Mr Hope.  There is his almshouse practice at stake, at all\r\nevents; and I fancy a good many families will have no more to do with\r\nhim if he defies the Hunters, and goes against the opinions of all his\r\nneighbours.  His wife must see that he has nobody with him.  I do pity\r\nthe poor young thing!"\r\n\r\n"Dear me!" said the old lady, "can nothing be done, I wonder.  I declare\r\nI am quite concerned.  I should hope something may be done.  I would\r\ntake the liberty of speaking to him myself, rather than that any harm\r\nshould happen to him.  He has always been so very kind to me, that I\r\nthink I could venture to say anything to him.  I will turn it over in my\r\nmind, and see what can be done."\r\n\r\n"You will not prevail with him, ma\'am, I am afraid.  If Mr Grey speaks\r\nin vain (as I know he has done), it is not likely that any one else will\r\nhave any influence over him.  No, no; the wilful must be left to their\r\nown devices.  Whatever you do, ma\'am, do not speak to the bride about\r\nit, or there is no knowing what you may bring upon yourself."\r\n\r\n"What could I bring upon myself, my dear?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, those who do not see the vixen in that pretty face of hers, have\r\nnot such good eyes as she has herself.  For God\'s sake, ma\'am, do not\r\noffend her!"\r\n\r\nMrs Enderby was now full of concern; and being as unhappy as she could\r\nbe made for the present, her daughter took her leave.  The old lady\r\nlooked into the fire and sighed, for some minutes after she was left\r\nalone.  When Phoebe re-entered, her mistress declared that she felt\r\nquite tired out, and must lie down.  Before she closed her eyes, she\r\nraised her head again, and said--\r\n\r\n"Phoebe, I am surprised at you--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, ma\'am, you mean about my taking the liberty to make a sign to you.\r\nBut, ma\'am, I trust you will excuse it, because I am sure Mr Hope would\r\nhave no objection to your seeing Mrs Grey; and, to my thought, there is\r\nno occasion to consult with anybody else; and I have no doubt Mrs Grey\r\nwill be calling again some day soon, just at a time when you are fit to\r\nsee her.  Is not there any book, or anything, ma\'am, that I could be\r\ncarrying over to Mrs Grey\'s while you are resting yourself, ma\'am?"\r\n\r\n"Ah! do so, Phoebe.  Carry that book,--it is not quite due, but that\r\ndoes not signify; carry that book over, and give my regards, and beg to\r\nknow how Mrs Grey and all the family are.  And if Mrs Grey _should_\r\ncome in this evening," she continued, in excuse to herself for her\r\ndevices, "I shall be able to find out, in a quiet way, where she gets\r\nher arrowroot; and Priscilla will be glad to know."\r\n\r\nWhatever it might be that Phoebe said to Alice, and that brought Mrs\r\nGrey out into the hall to speak herself to Phoebe, the result was that\r\nMrs Grey\'s lantern was ordered as soon as it grew dark, and that she\r\narrived in Mrs Enderby\'s apartment just as the old lady had waked from\r\nher doze, and while the few tears that had escaped from under her\r\neyelids before she slept were yet scarcely dried upon her cheeks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER NINETEEN.\r\n\r\nHOME AT "THE HOPES\'."\r\n\r\nThe evil consequences of Mr Hope\'s voting for Lowry had not been\r\nexaggerated in the anticipations of his friends and vigilant neighbours;\r\nand these consequences were rather aggravated than alleviated by the\r\ncircumstance that Mr Lowry won the election.  First, the inhabitants of\r\nDeerbrook were on the watch for any words which might fall from Sir\r\nWilliam or Lady Hunter; and when it was reported that Sir William had\r\nfrowned, and sworn an oath at Mr Hope, on hearing how he had voted, and\r\nthat Lady Hunter had asked whether it was possible that Mr Hope had\r\nforgotten under whose interest he held his appointment to attend the\r\nalmshouses and the neighbouring hamlet, several persons determined to be\r\nbeforehand with their great neighbours, and to give the benefit of their\r\nfamily practice to some one of better politics than Mr Hope.  In\r\nanother set of minds, a real fear of Mr Hope, as a dangerous person,\r\nsprang up under the heat of the displeasure of the influential members\r\nof society.  Such were slow to have recourse to another medical\r\nattendant, and undertook the management of the health of their own\r\nfamilies, till they could find an adviser in whom they could perfectly\r\nconfide.  When Mr Lowry gained the contest, the population of Deerbrook\r\nwas electrified, and the unpleasantness of their surprise was visited\r\nupon the only supporter of Mr Lowry whom the place contained.  Wise\r\nfolks were not wanting who talked of the skill which some persons had in\r\nkeeping on the winning side,--of reasons which time sometimes revealed\r\nfor persons choosing to be singular,--and some remarkable incidents were\r\nreported of conversations between Mr Lowry and Mr Hope in the lanes,\r\nand of certain wonderful advantages which had lately fallen to one or\r\nanother of Mr Hope\'s acquaintances, through some strong political\r\ninterest.  Mr Rowland doubted, at his own table, all the news he heard\r\non the subject, and said everywhere that he did not see why a man should\r\nnot vote as he pleased.  Mr Grey was very sorry about the whole affair;\r\nhe was sorry that there had been any contest at all for the county, as\r\nit disturbed the peace of Deerbrook; he was sorry that the candidate he\r\npreferred had won, as the fact exasperated the temper of Deerbrook; he\r\nwas sorry that Hope had voted, to the detriment of his name and rising\r\nfortunes; and he was sorry that he himself had been unable at last to\r\nvote for Lowry, to keep his young friend in countenance: it was truly\r\nunlucky that he should have passed his promise early to Sir William\r\nHunter not to vote.  It was a sad business altogether.  It was only to\r\nbe hoped that it would pass out of people\'s minds; that things would\r\nsoon get into their usual train; and that it might be seven years before\r\nthere was another election.\r\n\r\nHester complained to her husband and sister of the manner in which she\r\nwas treated by the tradespeople of the place.  She had desired to put\r\nherself on a footing of acquaintanceship with them, as neighbours, and\r\npersons with whom there must be a constant transaction of business for\r\nlife.  She saw at once the difference in the relation between\r\ntradespeople and their customers in a large town like Birmingham, and in\r\na village where there is but one baker, where the grocer and hatter are\r\nthe same personage, and where you cannot fly from your butcher, be he\r\never so much your foe.  Hester therefore made it her business to\r\ntransact herself all affairs with the village tradesmen.  She began her\r\nhousekeeping energetically, and might be seen in Mr Jones\'s open shop\r\nin the coldest morning of January, selecting her joint of meat; or\r\ndeciding among brown sugars at Tucker\'s, the grocer\'s.  After the\r\nelection, she found some difference in the manner of most of the\r\nshop-people towards her; and she fancied more than there was.  With some\r\nof these persons, there was no more in their minds than the\r\nconsciousness of having discussed the new family and Mr Hope\'s vote,\r\nand come to a conclusion against his "principles."  With others, Mrs\r\nRowland\'s influence had done deeper mischief.  A few words dropped by\r\nherself, or reports of her sayings, circulated by her servants,\r\noccasioned dislike or alarm which Hester\'s sensitiveness apprehended at\r\nonce, and forthwith exaggerated.  She complained to her husband that she\r\ncould not go to the shops with any comfort, and that she thought she\r\nmust turn over the housekeeping to Morris.  Margaret remonstrated\r\nagainst this; and, by being her sister\'s constant companion in her walks\r\nof business as well as pleasure, hoped to be able to keep the peace, and\r\nto preserve or restore, if need were, a good understanding between\r\nparties who could most materially promote or injure each other\'s\r\ncomfort.  The leisure hours to which she had looked forward with such\r\ntransport were all chequered with anxiety on this subject, in the\r\nintervals of speculation on another matter, to which she found her mind\r\nconstantly recurring, in spite of her oft-repeated conviction that it\r\nwas no concern of hers,--where Mr Enderby was,--what he was doing,--and\r\nwhen he would come.  Day by day, as she spread her books before her, or\r\nbegan to write, she wondered at her own listlessness about employments\r\nto which she had looked forward with so much eagerness; and when she\r\ndetected herself gazing into the fire by the half-hour together, or\r\nallowing the ink to dry in her suspended pen, she found that she was as\r\nfar as ever from deciding whether Hester was not now in the way to be\r\nless happy than ever, and how it was that, with all her close friendship\r\nwith Philip Enderby, of which she had spoken so confidently to Maria,\r\nshe was now in perfect ignorance of his movements and intentions.  The\r\nwhole was very strange, and, in the experience, somewhat dreary.\r\n\r\nHer great comfort was Edward: this was a new support and a strong one:\r\nbut even here she was compelled to own herself somewhat disappointed.\r\nThis brotherly relation, for which she had longed all her life, did not\r\nbring the fulness of satisfaction which she had anticipated.  She had\r\nnot a fault to find with Edward: she was always called upon by his daily\r\nconduct for admiration, esteem, and affection; but all this was not of\r\nthe profit to her which she had expected.  He seemed altered: the flow\r\nof his spirits was much moderated; but perhaps this was no loss, as his\r\ncalmness, his gentle seriousness, and domestic benevolence were brought\r\nout more strikingly than ever.  Margaret\'s disappointment lay in the\r\nintercourse between themselves.  That Edward was reserved--that beneath\r\nhis remarkable frankness there lay an uncommunicativeness of\r\ndisposition--no one could before his marriage have made her believe: yet\r\nit certainly was so.  Though Hester and she never discussed Edward\'s\r\ncharacter, more or less--though Hester\'s love for him, and Margaret\'s\r\nrespect for that love, rendered all such conversation unpossible,\r\nMargaret was perfectly well aware that Hester\'s conviction on this\r\nparticular point was the same as her own--that Hester had discovered\r\nthat she had not fully understood her husband, and that there remained a\r\nregion of his character into which she had not yet penetrated.  Margaret\r\nwas obliged to conclude that all this was natural and right, and that\r\nwhat she had heard said of men generally was true even of Edward Hope--\r\nthat there are depths of character where there are not regions of\r\nexperience, which defy the sympathy and sagacity of women.  However\r\nnatural and right all this might be, she could not but be sorry for it.\r\nIt brought disappointment to herself, and, as she sadly suspected, to\r\nHester.  While continually and delightedly compelled to honour and\r\nregard him more and more, and to rely upon him as she had never before\r\nrelied, she felt that he did not win, and even did not desire, any\r\nintimate confidence.  She found that she could still say things to Maria\r\nwhich she could not say to him; and that, while their domestic\r\nconversation rarely flagged--while it embraced a boundless range of\r\nfact, and all that they could ascertain of morals, philosophy, and\r\nreligion--the greatest psychological events, the most interesting\r\nexperiences of her life might go forward without express recognition\r\nfrom Edward.  Such was her view of the case; and this was the\r\ndisappointment which, in the early days of her new mode of life, she had\r\nto acknowledge to herself, and to conceal from all others.\r\n\r\nOne fine bright morning towards the end of January, the sisters set out\r\nfor their walk, willingly quitting the clear crackling fire within for\r\nthe sharp air and sparkling pathways without.\r\n\r\n"Which way shall we go?" asked Margaret.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I suppose along the high-road, as usual.  How provoking it is that\r\nwe are prevented, day after day, from getting to the woods by my\r\nsnow-boots not having arrived!  We will go by Mrs Howell\'s for the\r\nchance of their having come."\r\n\r\nMrs Howell had two expressions of countenance--the gracious and the\r\nprim.  Till lately, Hester had been favoured with the first exclusively.\r\nShe was now to be amused with variety, and the prim was offered to her\r\ncontemplation.  Never did Mrs Howell look more inaccessible than\r\nto-day, when she scarcely rose from her stool behind the counter, to\r\nlearn what was the errand of her customer.\r\n\r\n"You guess what I am come for, Mrs Howell, I dare say.  Have my boots\r\narrived yet?"\r\n\r\n"I am not aware of their having arrived, ma\'am.  But Miss Miskin is now\r\noccupied in that department."\r\n\r\n"Only consider how the winter is getting on, Mrs Howell! and I can walk\r\nnowhere but in the high-road, for want of my boot."\r\n\r\nMrs Howell curtsied.\r\n\r\n"Can you not hasten your agent, or help me to my boots, one way or\r\nanother?  Is there no one in Deerbrook whom you could employ to make me\r\na pair?"\r\n\r\nMrs Howell cast up her hands and eyes.\r\n\r\n"How do other ladies manage to obtain their boots before the snow comes,\r\ninstead of after it has melted?"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you will ask them yourself ma\'am: I conceive you know all the\r\nladies in Deerbrook.  You will find Miss Miskin in that department,\r\nladies, if you wish to investigate."\r\n\r\nHester invaded the domain of Miss Miskin--the shoe-shop behind the other\r\ncounter--in the hope of finding something to put on her feet, which\r\nshould enable her to walk where she pleased.  While engaged in turning\r\nover the stock, without any help from Miss Miskin, who was imitating\r\nMrs Howell\'s distant manner with considerable success, a carriage drove\r\nup to the door, which could be no other than Sir William Hunter\'s; and\r\nLady Hunter\'s voice was accordingly heard, the next minute, asking for\r\ngreen sewing-silk.  The gentle drawl of Mrs Howell\'s tone conveyed that\r\nher countenance had resumed its primary expression.  She observed upon\r\nthe horrors of the fire which had happened at Blickley the night before.\r\nLady Hunter had not heard of it; and the relation therefore followed\r\nof: the burning down of a house and shop in Blickley, when a nursemaid\r\nand baby were lost in the flames.\r\n\r\n"I should hope it is not true," observed Lady Hunter.  "Last night, did\r\nyou say?--Early this morning?  There has scarcely been time for the news\r\nto arrive of a fire at Blickley early this morning."\r\n\r\n"It is certainly true, however, my lady.  No doubt whatever of the\r\ncatastrophe, I am grieved to say."  And Mrs Howell\'s sighs were\r\nsympathetically responded to by Miss Miskin in the back shop.\r\n\r\n"But how did you hear it?" asked Lady Hunter.\r\n\r\nThere was no audible answer.  There were probably signs and intimations\r\nof something; for Lady Hunter made a circuit round the shop, on some\r\npretence, and stared in at the door of the shoe-parlour, just at the\r\nright moment for perceiving, if she so pleased, the beautiful smallness\r\nof Hester\'s foot.  Some low, murmuring, conversation then passed at Mrs\r\nHowell\'s counter, when the words "black servant" alone met Margaret\'s\r\near.\r\n\r\nHester found nothing that she could wear.  The more she pressed for\r\ninformation and assistance about obtaining boots, the more provokingly\r\ncool Miss Miskin grew.  At last Hester turned to her sister with a hasty\r\ninquiry what was to be done.\r\n\r\n"We must hope for better fortune before next winter, I suppose," said\r\nMargaret, smiling.\r\n\r\n"And wet my feet every day this winter," said Hester; "for I will not be\r\nconfined to the high-road for any such reason as this."\r\n\r\n"Dear me, ma\'am, you are warm!" simpered Miss Miskin.\r\n\r\n"I warm!  What do you mean, Miss Miskin?"\r\n\r\n"You are warm, ma\'am:--not that it is of any consequence; but you are a\r\nlittle warm at present."\r\n\r\n"Nobody can charge that upon you, Miss Miskin, I must say," observed\r\nMargaret, laughing.\r\n\r\n"No, ma\'am, that they cannot, nor ever will.  I am not apt to be warm,\r\nand I hope I can excuse...  Good morning, ladies."\r\n\r\nMrs Howell treated her customers with a swimming curtsey as they went\r\nout, glancing at her shop-woman the while.  Lady Hunter favoured them\r\nwith a full stare.\r\n\r\n"What excessive impertinence!" exclaimed Hester.  "To tell me that I was\r\nwarm, and she hoped she could excuse!  My husband will hardly believe\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, he will.  He knows them for two ignorant, silly women; worth\r\nobserving, perhaps, but not worth minding.  Have you any other shop to\r\ngo to?"\r\n\r\nYes, the tinman\'s, for a saucepan or two of a size not yet supplied, for\r\nwhich Morris had petitioned.\r\n\r\nThe tinman was either unable or not very anxious to understand Hester\'s\r\nrequisitions.  He brought out everything but what was wanted; and was so\r\nextremely interested in observing something that was going on over the\r\nway, that he was every moment casting glances abroad between the\r\ndutch-ovens and fenders that half-darkened his window.  The ladies at\r\nlast looked over the way too, and saw a gig containing a black footman\r\nstanding before the opposite house.\r\n\r\n"A stranger in Deerbrook!" observed Margaret, as they issued from the\r\nshop.  "I do not wonder that Mr Hill had so little attention to spare\r\nfor us."\r\n\r\nThe sisters had been so accustomed, during all the years of their\r\nBirmingham life, to see faces that they did not know, that they could\r\nnot yet sympathise with the emotions caused in Deerbrook by the\r\nappearance of a stranger.  They walked on, forgetting in conversation\r\nall about the gig and black servant.  Hester had not been pleased by the\r\ninsufficient attention she had met with in both the shops she had\r\nvisited, and she did not enjoy her walk as was her wont.  As they trod\r\nthe crisp and glittering snow, Margaret hoped the little Rowlands and\r\nGreys were happy in making the snow-man which had been the vision of\r\ntheir imaginations since the winter set in: but Hester cast longing eyes\r\non the dark woods which sprang from the sheeted meadows, and thought\r\nnothing could be so delightful as to wander among them, and gather\r\nicicles from the boughs, even though the paths should be ankle-deep in\r\nsnow.\r\n\r\nJust when they were proposing to turn back, a horseman appeared on the\r\nridge of the rising ground, over which the road passed.  "It is Edward!"\r\ncried Hester.  "I had no idea we should meet him on this road."  And she\r\nquickened her pace, and her countenance brightened as if she had not\r\nseen him for a month.  Before they met him, however, the gig with the\r\nblack footman, now containing also a gentleman driving, overtook and\r\nslowly passed them--the gentleman looking round him, as if in search of\r\nsome dwelling hereabouts.  On approaching Hope, the stranger drew up,\r\ntouched his hat, and asked a question; and on receiving the answer,\r\nbowed, turned round, and repassed Hester and Margaret.  Hope joined his\r\nwife and sister, and walked his horse beside the path.\r\n\r\n"Who is that gentleman, Edward?"\r\n\r\n"I believe it is Mr Foster, the surgeon at Blickley."\r\n\r\n"What did he want with you?"\r\n\r\n"He wanted to know whether he was in the right road to the Russell\r\nTaylors."\r\n\r\n"The Russell Taylors!  Your patients!"\r\n\r\n"Once my patients, but no longer so.  It seems they are Mr Foster\'s\r\npatients now."\r\n\r\nHester made no reply.\r\n\r\n"Can you see from your pathway what is going on below there in the\r\nmeadow?  I see the skaters very busy on the ponds.  Why do not you go\r\nthere, instead of walking here every day?"\r\n\r\nMargaret had to explain the case about the snow-boots, for Hester\'s face\r\nwas bathed in tears.  Edward rallied her gently; but it would not do.\r\nShe motioned to him to ride on, and he thought it best to do so.  The\r\nsisters proceeded in silence, Hester\'s tears flowing faster and faster.\r\nInstead of walking through Deerbrook, she took a back road homewards,\r\nand drew down her veil.  As ill luck would have it, however, they met\r\nSophia Grey and her sisters, and Sophia would stop.  She was about to\r\nturn back with them, when she saw that something was the matter, and\r\nthen she checked herself awkwardly, and wished her cousins good morning,\r\nwhile Fanny and Mary were staring at Hester.\r\n\r\n"One ought not to mind," said Margaret, half laughing: "there are so\r\nmany causes for grown people\'s tears! but I always feel now as I did\r\nwhen I was a child--a shame at being seen in tears, and an excessive\r\ndesire to tell people that I have not been naughty."\r\n\r\n"You could not have told Sophia so of me, I am sure," said Hester.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I could; you are not crying because you have been naughty, but you\r\nare naughty because you cry; and that may be cured presently."\r\n\r\nIt was not presently cured, however.  During the whole of dinner-time,\r\nHester\'s tears continued to flow; and she could not eat, though she made\r\nefforts to do so.  Edward and Margaret talked a great deal about skating\r\nand snow-men, and about the fire at Blickley; but they came to a stand\r\nat last.  The foot-boy went about on tiptoe, and shut the door as if he\r\nhad been in a sick-room; and this made Hester\'s short sobs only the more\r\naudible.  It was a relief when the oranges were on the table at last,\r\nand the door closed behind the dinner and the boy.  Margaret began to\r\npeel an orange for her sister, and Edward poured out a glass of wine; he\r\nplaced it before her, and then drew his chair to her side, saying--\r\n\r\n"Now, my dear, let us get to the bottom of all this distress."\r\n\r\n"No, do not try, Edward.  Never mind me!  I shall get the better of\r\nthis, by-and-by: only let me alone."\r\n\r\n"Thank you!" said Hope, smiling.  "I like to see people reasonable!  I\r\nam to see you sorrowing in this way, and for very sufficient cause, and\r\nI am neither to mind your troubles nor my own, but to be as merry as if\r\nnothing had happened!  Is not this reasonable, Margaret?"\r\n\r\n"For very sufficient cause!" said Hester, eagerly.\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed; for very sufficient cause.  It must be a painful thing to\r\nyou to find my neighbours beginning to dislike me; to have the\r\ntradespeople impertinent to you on my account; to see my patients leave\r\nme, and call in somebody from a distance, in the face of all Deerbrook.\r\nIt must make you anxious to think what is to become of us, if the\r\ndiscontent continues and spreads: and it must be a bitter disappointment\r\nto you to find that to be my wife is not to be so happy as we expected.\r\nHere is cause enough for tears."\r\n\r\nIn the midst of her grief, Hester looked up at her husband with an\r\nexpression of gratitude and tenderness which consoled him for her.\r\n\r\n"I will not answer for it," he continued, "but that we may all three sit\r\ndown to weep together, one of these days."\r\n\r\n"And then," said Margaret, "Hester will be the first to cheer up and\r\ncomfort us."\r\n\r\n"I have no doubt of it," replied Hope.  "Meantime, is there anything\r\nthat you would have had done otherwise by me?  Was I right or not to\r\nvote? and was there anything wrong in my manner of doing it?  Is there\r\nany cause whatever for repentance?"\r\n\r\n"None, none," cried Hester.  "You have been right throughout.  I glory\r\nin all you do."\r\n\r\n"To me it seems that you could not have done otherwise," observed\r\nMargaret.  "It was a simple, unavoidable act, done with the simplicity\r\nof affairs which happen in natural course.  I neither repent it for you,\r\nnor glory in it."\r\n\r\n"That is just my view of it, Margaret.  And it follows that the\r\nconsequences are to be taken as coming in natural course too.  Does not\r\nthis again simplify the affair, Hester?"\r\n\r\n"It lights it up," replied Hester.  "It reminds me how all would have\r\nbeen if you had acted otherwise than as you did.  It is, to be sure,\r\nscarcely possible to conceive of such a thing,--but if you had not\r\nvoted, I should have--not despised you in any degree,--but lost\r\nconfidence in you a little."\r\n\r\n"That is a very mild way of putting it," said Hope, laughing.\r\n\r\n"Thank Heaven, we are spared that!" exclaimed Margaret.  "But, brother,\r\ntell us the worst that you think can come of this displeasure against\r\nyou.  I rather suspect, however, that we have suffered the worst\r\nalready, in discovering that people can be displeased with you."\r\n\r\n"That being so extremely rare a lot in this world, and especially in the\r\nworld of a village," replied Hope, "I really do not know what to expect\r\nas the last result of this affair, nor am I anxious to foresee.  I never\r\nliked the sort of attachment that most of my neighbours have testified\r\nfor me.  It was to their honour in as far as it showed kindness of\r\nheart, but it was unreasonable: so unreasonable that I imagine the\r\nopposite feelings which are now succeeding may be just as much in\r\nexcess.  Suppose it should be so, Hester?"\r\n\r\n"Well, what then?" she asked, sighing.\r\n\r\n"Suppose our neighbours should send me to Coventry, and my patients\r\nshould leave me so far as that we should not have enough to live on?"\r\n\r\n"That would be persecution," cried Hester, brightening.  "I could bear\r\npersecution,--downright persecution."\r\n\r\n"You could bear seeing your husband torn by lions in the amphitheatre,"\r\nsaid Margaret, smiling, "but..."\r\n\r\n"But a toss of Mrs Howell\'s head is unendurable," said Hope, with\r\nsolemnity.\r\n\r\nHester looked down, blushing like a chidden child.\r\n\r\n"But about this persecution," said she.  "What made you ask those\r\nquestions just now?"\r\n\r\n"I find my neighbours more angry with me than I could have supposed\r\npossible, my dear.  I have been treated with great and growing rudeness\r\nfor some days.  In a place like this, you know, offences seldom come\r\nalone.  If you do a thing which a village public does not approve, there\r\nwill be offence in whatever else you say and do for some time after.\r\nAnd I suspect that is my case now.  I may be mistaken, however; and\r\nwhatever happens, I hope, my love, we shall all be to the last degree\r\ncareful not to see offence where it is not intended."\r\n\r\n"Not to do the very thing we are suffering under ourselves," observed\r\nMargaret.\r\n\r\n"We will not watch our neighbours, and canvass their opinions of us by\r\nour own fireside," said Hope.  "We will conclude them all to be our\r\nfriends till they give us clear evidence to the contrary.  Shall it not\r\nbe so, love?"\r\n\r\n"I know what you mean," said Hester, with some resentment in her voice\r\nand manner.  "You cannot trust my temper in your affairs: and you are\r\nperfectly right.  My temper is not to be trusted."\r\n\r\n"Very few are, in the first agonies of unpopularity; and such faith in\r\none\'s neighbours as shall supersede watching them ought hardly to be\r\nlooked for in the atmosphere of Deerbrook.  We must all look to\r\nourselves."\r\n\r\n"I understand you," said Hester.  "I take the lesson home, I assure you.\r\nIt is clear to me through your cautious phrase,--the `we,\' and `all of\r\nus,\' and `ourselves.\'  But remember this,--that people are not made\r\nalike, and are not able, and not intended to feel alike; and if some\r\nhave less power than others over their sorrow, at least over their\r\ntears, it does not follow that they cannot bear as well what they have\r\nto bear.  If I cannot sit looking as Margaret does, peeling oranges and\r\nphilosophising, it may not be that I have less strength at my heart, but\r\nthat I have more at stake,--more--"\r\n\r\nHope started from her side, and leaned against the mantelpiece, covering\r\nhis face with his hands.  At this moment, the boy entered with a message\r\nfrom a patient in the next street, who wanted Mr Hope.\r\n\r\n"Oh, do not leave me, Edward!  Do not leave me at this moment!" cried\r\nHester.  "Come back for five minutes!"\r\n\r\nHope quietly said that he should return presently, and went out.  When\r\nthe hall door was heard to close behind him, Hester flung herself down\r\non the sofa.  Whatever momentary resentment Margaret might have felt at\r\nher sister\'s words, it vanished at the sight of Hester\'s attitude of\r\nwretchedness.  She sat on a footstool beside the sofa, and took her\r\nsister\'s hand in hers.\r\n\r\n"You are kinder to me than I deserve," murmured Hester: "but, Margaret,\r\nmind what I say! never marry, Margaret!  Never love, and never marry,\r\nMargaret!"\r\n\r\nMargaret laid her hand on her sister\'s shoulder, saying,--"Stop here,\r\nHester!  While I was the only friend you had, it was right and kind to\r\ntell me all that was in your heart.  But now that there is one nearer\r\nand dearer, and far, far worthier than I, I can hear nothing like this.\r\nNor are you fit just now to speak of these serious things: you are\r\ndiscomposed--"\r\n\r\n"One would think you were echoing Miss Miskin, Margaret,--`You are warm,\r\nma\'am.\'  But you must hear this much.  I insist upon it.  If you would\r\nhave heard me, you would have found that I was not going to say a word\r\nabout my husband inconsistent with all the love and honour you would\r\nhave him enjoy.  I assure you, you might trust me not to complain of my\r\nhusband.  I have no words in which to say how noble he is.  But, oh! it\r\nis all true about the wretchedness of married life!  I am wretched,\r\nMargaret."\r\n\r\n"So I see," said Margaret, in deep sorrow.\r\n\r\n"Life is a blank to me.  I have no hope left.  I am neither wiser, nor\r\nbetter, nor happier for God having given me all that should make a woman\r\nwhat I meant to be.  What can God give me more than I have?"\r\n\r\n"I was just thinking so," replied Margaret, mournfully.\r\n\r\n"What follows then?"\r\n\r\n"Not that all married people are unhappy because you are."\r\n\r\n"Yes, oh, yes! all who are capable of happiness: all who can love.  The\r\ntruth is, there is no perfect confidence in the world: there is no rest\r\nfor one\'s heart.  I believed there was, and I am disappointed: and if\r\nyou believe there is, you will be disappointed too, I warn you."\r\n\r\n"I shall not neglect your warning; but I do believe there is rest for\r\nrational affections--I am confident there is, if the primary condition\r\nis fulfilled--if there is repose in God together with human love."\r\n\r\n"You think that trust in God is wanting in me?"\r\n\r\n"Do let us speak of something else," said Margaret.  "We are wrong to\r\nthink and talk of ourselves as we do.  There is something sickly about\r\nour state while we do so, and we deserve to be suffering as we are.\r\nCome! let us be up and doing.  Let me read to you; or will you practise\r\nwith me till Edward comes back?"\r\n\r\n"Not till you have answered my question, Margaret.  Do you believe that\r\nmy wretchedness is from want of trust in God?"\r\n\r\n"I believe," said Margaret, seriously, "that all restless and passionate\r\nsuffering is from that cause.  And now, Hester, no more."\r\n\r\nHester allowed Margaret to read to her; but it would not do.  She was\r\ntoo highly wrought up for common interests.  The reading was broken off\r\nby her hysterical sobs; and it was clear that the best thing to be done\r\nwas to get her to bed, under Morris\'s care, that all agitating\r\nconversation might be avoided.  When Mr Hope returned, he found\r\nMargaret sitting alone at the tea-table.  If she had had no greater\r\npower of self-control than her sister, Edward might have been made\r\nwretched enough, for her heart was full of dismay: but she felt the\r\nimportance of the duty of supporting him, and he found her, though\r\nserious, apparently cheerful.\r\n\r\n"I have sent Hester to bed," said she, as he entered.  "She was worn\r\nout.  Yes: just go and speak to her; but do not give her the opportunity\r\nof any more conversation till she has slept.  Tell her that I am going\r\nto send her some tea; and by that time yours will be ready."\r\n\r\n"Just one word upon the events of to-day," said Hope, as he took his\r\nseat at the tea-table, after having reported that Hester was tolerably\r\ncomposed:--"just one word, and no more.  We must avoid bringing emotions\r\nto a point--giving occasion for--"\r\n\r\n"I entirely agree with you," said Margaret.  "She requires to be drawn\r\nout of herself.  She cannot bear that opening of the sluices, which is a\r\nbenefit and comfort to some people.  Let us keep them shut, and when it\r\ncomes to acting, see how she will act!"\r\n\r\n"Bless you for that!" was on Hope\'s lips; but he did not say it.  Tea\r\nwas soon dismissed, and he then took up the newspaper; and when that was\r\nfinished, he found he could not read to Margaret--he must write:--he had\r\na case to report for a medical journal.\r\n\r\n"I hope I have not spoiled your evening," said Hester, languidly, when\r\nher sister went to bid her good-night.  "I have been listening; but I\r\ncould not hear you either laughing or talking."\r\n\r\n"Because we have been neither laughing nor talking.  My brother has been\r\nwriting--"\r\n\r\n"Writing!  To whom?  To Emily, or to Anne?"\r\n\r\n"To a far more redoubtable person than either: to the editor of some one\r\nof those green and blue periodicals that he devours, as if they were\r\npoetry.  And I have been copying music."\r\n\r\n"How tired you look!"\r\n\r\n"Well, then, good-night!"\r\n\r\nMargaret might well look tired; but she did not go to rest for long.\r\nHow should she rest, while her soul was sick with dismay, her heart\r\nweighed down with disappointment, her sister\'s sobs still sounding in\r\nher ear, her sister\'s agonised countenance rising up from moment to\r\nmoment, as often as she closed her eyes?  And all this within the sacred\r\nenclosure of home, in the very sanctuary of peace!  All this where love\r\nhad guided the suffering one to marriage--where there was present\r\nneither sickness, nor calamity, nor guilt, but the very opposites of all\r\nthese!  Could it then be true, that the only sanctuary of peace is in\r\nthe heart? that while love is the master passion of humanity, the\r\nmain-spring of human action, the crowning interest of human life--while\r\nit is ordained, natural, inevitable, it should issue as if it were\r\ndiscountenanced by Providence, unnatural, and to be repelled?  Could it\r\nbe so?  Was Hester\'s warning against love, against marriage, reasonable,\r\nand to be regarded?  That warning Margaret thought she could never put\r\naside, so heavily had it sunk upon her heart, crushing--she knew not\r\nwhat there.  If it was not a reasonable warning, whither should she turn\r\nfor consolation for Hester?  If this misery arose out of an incapacity\r\nin Hester herself for happiness in domestic life, then farewell sisterly\r\ncomfort--farewell all the bright visions she had ever indulged on behalf\r\nof the one who had always been her nearest and dearest?  Instead of\r\nthese, there must be struggle and grief, far deeper than in the anxious\r\nyears that were gone; struggle with an evil which must grow if it does\r\nnot diminish, and grief for an added sufferer--for one who deserved\r\nblessing where he was destined to receive torture.  This was not the\r\nfirst time by a hundred that Hester had kept Margaret from her pillow,\r\nand then driven rest from it; but never had the trial been so great as\r\nnow.  There had been anxiety formerly; now there was something like\r\ndespair, after an interval of hope and comparative ease.\r\n\r\nMankind are ignorant enough, Heaven knows, both in the mass, about\r\ngeneral interests, and individually, about the things which belong to\r\ntheir peace: but of all mortals, none perhaps are so awfully\r\nself-deluded as the unamiable.  They do not, any more than others, sin\r\nfor the sake of sinning; but the amount of woe caused by their selfish\r\nunconsciousness is such as may well make their weakness an equivalent\r\nfor other men\'s gravest crimes.  There is a great diversity of\r\nhiding-places for their consciences--many mansions in the dim prison of\r\ndiscontent: but it may be doubted whether, in the hour when all shall be\r\nuncovered to the eternal day, there will be revealed a lower deep than\r\nthe hell which they have made.  They, perhaps, are the only order of\r\nevil ones who suffer hell without seeing and knowing that it is hell.\r\nBut they are under a heavier curse even than this; they inflict\r\ntorments, second only to their own, with an unconsciousness almost\r\nworthy of spirits of light.  While they complacently conclude themselves\r\nthe victims of others, or pronounce, inwardly or aloud, that they are\r\ntoo singular, or too refined, for common appreciation, they are putting\r\nin motion an enginery of torture whose aspect will one day blast their\r\nminds\' sight.  The dumb groans of their victims will sooner or later\r\nreturn upon their ears from the depths of the heaven, to which the\r\nsorrows of men daily ascend.  The spirit sinks under the prospect of the\r\nretribution of the unamiable, if all that happens be indeed for\r\neternity, if there be indeed a record--an impress on some one or other\r\nhuman spirit--of every chilling frown, of every querulous tone, of every\r\nbitter jest, of every insulting word--of all abuses of that tremendous\r\npower which mind has over mind.  The throbbing pulses, the quivering\r\nnerves, the wrung hearts, that surround the unamiable--what a cloud of\r\nwitnesses is here! and what plea shall avail against them?  The terror\r\nof innocents who should know no fear--the vindictive emotions of\r\ndependants who dare not complain--the faintness of heart of life-long\r\ncompanions--the anguish of those who love--the unholy exultation of\r\nthose who hate,--what an array of judges is here! and where can appeal\r\nbe lodged against their sentence?  Is pride of singularity a rational\r\nplea?  Is super-refinement, or circumstance of God, or uncongeniality in\r\nman, a sufficient ground of appeal, when the refinement of one is a\r\ngrace granted for the luxury of all, when circumstance is given to be\r\nconquered, and uncongeniality is appointed for discipline?  The\r\nsensualist has brutified the seraphic nature with which he was endowed.\r\nThe depredator has intercepted the rewards of toil, and marred the image\r\nof justice, and dimmed the lustre of faith in men\'s minds.  The imperial\r\ntyrant has invoked a whirlwind, to lay waste, for an hour of God\'s\r\neternal year, some region of society.  But the unamiable--the domestic\r\ntorturer--has heaped wrong upon wrong, and woe upon woe, through the\r\nwhole portion of time which was given into his power, till it would be\r\nrash to say that any others are more guilty than he.  If there be hope\r\nor solace for such, it is that there may have been tempers about him the\r\nopposite of his own.  It is matter of humiliating gratitude that there\r\nwere some which he could not ruin; and that he was the medium of\r\ndiscipline by which they were exercised in forbearance, in divine\r\nforgiveness and love.  If there be solace in such an occasional result,\r\nlet it be made the most of by those who need it; for it is the only\r\npossible alleviation to their remorse.  Let them accept it as the free\r\ngift of a mercy which they have insulted, and a long-suffering which\r\nthey have defied.\r\n\r\nNot thus, however, did Margaret regard the case of her sister.  She had\r\nbut of late ceased to suppose herself in the wrong when Hester was\r\nunhappy: and though she was now relieved from the responsibility of her\r\nsister\'s peace, she was slow to blame--reluctant to class the case lower\r\nthan as one of infirmity.  Her last waking thoughts (and they were very\r\nlate) were of pity and of prayer.\r\n\r\nAs the door closed behind Margaret, Hope had flung down his pen.  In one\r\nmoment she had returned for a book; and she found him by the fireside,\r\nleaning his head upon his arms against the wall.  There was something in\r\nhis attitude which startled her out of her wish for her book, and she\r\nquietly withdrew without it.  He turned, and spoke, but she was gone.\r\n\r\n"So this is home!" thought he, as he surveyed the room, filled as it was\r\nwith tokens of occupation, and appliances of domestic life.  "It is home\r\nto be more lonely than ever before--and yet never to be alone with my\r\nsecret!  At my own table, by my own hearth, I cannot look up into the\r\nfaces around me, nor say what I am thinking.  In every act and every\r\nword I am in danger of disturbing the innocent--even of sullying the\r\npure, and of breaking the bruised reed.  Would to God I had never seen\r\nthem!  How have I abhorred bondage all my life! and I am in bondage\r\nevery hour that I spend at home.  I have always insisted that there was\r\nno bondage but in guilt.  Is it so?  If it be so, then I am either\r\nguilty, or in reality free.  I have settled this before.  I am guilty;\r\nor rather, I have been guilty; and this is my retribution.  Not guilty\r\ntowards Margaret.  Thank God, I have done her no wrong!  Thank God, I\r\nhave never been in her eyes--what I must not think of!  Nor could I ever\r\nhave been, if...  She loves Enderby, I am certain, though she does not\r\nknow it herself.  It is a blessing that she loves him, if I could but\r\nalways feel it so.  I am not guilty towards her, nor towards Hester,\r\nexcept in the weakness of declining to inflict that suffering upon her\r\nwhich, fearful as it must have been, might perhaps have proved less\r\nthan, with all my care, she must undergo now.  There was my fault.  I\r\ndid not, I declare, seek to attach her.  I did nothing wrong so far.\r\nBut I dared to measure suffering--to calculate consequences\r\npresumptuously and vainly: and this is my retribution.  How would it\r\nhave been, if I had allowed them to go back to Birmingham, and had been\r\nhaunted with the image of her there?  But why go over this again, when\r\nmy very soul is weary of it all?  It lies behind, and let it be\r\nforgotten.  The present is what I have to do with, and it is quite\r\nenough.  I have injured, cruelly injured myself; and I must bear with\r\nmyself.  Here I am, charged with the duty of not casting my shadow over\r\nthe innocent, and of strengthening the infirm.  I have a clear duty\r\nbefore me--that is one blessing.  The innocent will soon be taken from\r\nunder my shadow--I trust so--for my duty there is almost too hard.  How\r\nshe would confide in me, and I must not let her, and must continually\r\ndisappoint her, and suffer in her affection.  I cannot even be to her\r\nwhat our relation warrants.  And all the while her thoughts are my\r\nthoughts; her...  But this will never do.  It is enough that she trusts\r\nme, and that I deserve that she should.  This is all that I can ever\r\nhave or hope for; but I have won thus much; and I shall keep it.  Not a\r\ndoubt or fear, not a moment\'s ruffle of spirits, shall she ever\r\nexperience from me.  As for my own poor sufferer--what months and years\r\nare before us both!  What a discipline before she can be at peace!  If\r\nshe were to look forward as I do, her heart would sink as mine does, and\r\nperhaps she would try...  But we must not look forward: her heart must\r\nnot sink.  I must keep it up.  She has strength under her weakness, and\r\nI must help her to bring it out and use it.  There ought to be, there\r\nmust be, peace in store for such generosity of spirit as lies under the\r\njealousy, for such devotedness, for such power.  Margaret says, `When it\r\ncomes to acting, see how she will act.\'  Oh, that it might please Heaven\r\nto send such adversity as would prove to herself how nobly she can act!\r\nIf some strong call on her power, would come in aid of what I would fain\r\ndo for her, I care not what it is.  If I can only witness my own wrong\r\nrepaired--if I can but see her blessed from within, let all other things\r\nbe as they may!  The very thought frees me, and I breathe again!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY.\r\n\r\nENDERBY NEWS.\r\n\r\n"Mamma, what do you think Fanny and Mary Grey say?" asked Matilda of her\r\nmother.\r\n\r\n"My dear, I wish you would not tease me with what the Greys say.  They\r\nsay very little that is worth repeating."\r\n\r\n"Well, but you must hear this, mamma.  Fanny and Mary were walking with\r\nSophia yesterday, and they met Mrs Hope and Miss Ibbotson in Turn-stile\r\nLane; and Mrs Hope was crying so, you can\'t think."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!  Crying!  What, in the middle of the day?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; just before dinner.  She had her veil down, and she did not want\r\nto stop, evidently, mamma.  She--."\r\n\r\n"I should wonder if she did," observed Mr Rowland from the other side\r\nof the newspaper he was reading.  "If Dr and Mrs Levitt were to come\r\nin the next time you cry, Matilda, you would not want to stay in the\r\nparlour, evidently, I should think.  For my part, I never show my face\r\nwhen I am crying."\r\n\r\n"You cry, papa!" cried little Anna.  "Do you ever cry?"\r\n\r\n"Have you never found me behind the deals, or among the sacks in the\r\ngranary, with my finger in my eye?"\r\n\r\n"No, papa.  Do show us how you look when you cry."\r\n\r\nMr Rowland\'s face, all dolefulness, emerged from behind the newspaper,\r\nand the children shouted.\r\n\r\n"But," said Matilda, observing that her mother\'s brow began to lower, "I\r\nthink it is very odd that Mrs Hope did not stay at home if she wanted\r\nto cry.  It is so very odd to go crying about the streets!"\r\n\r\n"I dare say Deerbrook is very much obliged to her," said papa.  "It will\r\nbe something to talk about for a week."\r\n\r\n"But what could she be crying for, papa?"\r\n\r\n"Suppose you ask her, my dear?  Had you not better put on your bonnet,\r\nand go directly to Mr Hope\'s, and ask, with our compliments, what Mrs\r\nHope was crying for at four o\'clock yesterday afternoon?  Of course she\r\ncan tell better than anybody else."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense, Mr Rowland," observed his lady.  "Go, children, it is very\r\nnear school-time."\r\n\r\n"No, mamma; not by--"\r\n\r\n"Go, I insist upon it, Matilda.  I will have you do as you are bid.  Go,\r\nGeorge: go, Anna.--Now, my love, did I not tell you so, long ago?  Do\r\nnot you remember my observing to you, how coldly Mr Hope took our\r\ncongratulations on his engagement in the summer?  I was sure there was\r\nsomething wrong.  They are not happy, depend upon it."\r\n\r\n"What a charming discovery that would be!"\r\n\r\n"You are very provoking, Mr Rowland!  I do believe you try to imitate\r\nMr Grey\'s dry way of talking to his wife."\r\n\r\n"I thought I had heard you admire that way, my dear."\r\n\r\n"For her, yes: it does very well for a woman like her: but I beg you\r\nwill not try it upon me, Mr Rowland."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, Mrs Rowland, I am going to be as serious as ever I was in\r\nmy life, when I warn you how you breathe such a suspicion as that the\r\nHopes are not happy.  Remember you have no evidence whatever about the\r\nmatter.  When you offered Mr Hope your congratulations, he was feeble\r\nfrom illness, and probably too much exhausted at the moment to show any\r\nfeeling, one way or another.  And as for this crying fit of Mrs Hope\'s,\r\nno one is better able than you, my dear, to tell how many causes there\r\nmay be for ladies\' tears besides being unhappily married."\r\n\r\n"Pray, Mr Rowland, make yourself easy, I beg.  Whom do you suppose I\r\nshould mention such a thing to?"\r\n\r\n"You have already mentioned it to yourself and me, my dear, which is\r\njust two persons too many.  Not a word more on the subject, if you\r\nplease."\r\n\r\nMrs Rowland saw that this was one of her husband\'s authority days;--\r\nrare days, when she could not have her own way, and her quiet husband\r\nwas really formidable.  She buckled on her armour, therefore, forthwith.\r\nThat armour was--silence.  Mr Rowland was sufficiently aware of the\r\nprocess now to be gone through, to avoid speaking, when he knew he\r\nshould obtain no reply.  He finished his newspaper without further\r\nremark, looked out a book from the shelves, half-whistling all the\r\nwhile, and left the room.\r\n\r\nMeantime, the children had gone to the schoolroom, disturbing Miss Young\r\nnearly an hour too soon.  Miss Young told them she was not at liberty;\r\nand when she heard that their mamma had sent them away from the\r\ndrawing-room, she asked why they could not play as usual.  It was so\r\ncold!  How did George manage to play?  George had not come in with the\r\nrest.  If he could play, so could they.  The little girls had no doubt\r\nGeorge would present himself soon: they did not know where he had run;\r\nbut he would soon have enough of the cold abroad, or of the dullness of\r\nthe nursery.  In another moment Miss Young was informed of the fact of\r\nHester\'s tears of yesterday; and, much as she wanted the time she was\r\ndeprived of; she was glad the children had come to her, that this piece\r\nof gossip might be stopped.  She went somewhat at length with them into\r\nthe subject of tears, showing that it is very hasty to conclude that any\r\none has been doing wrong, even in the case of a child\'s weeping; and\r\nmuch more with regard to grown people.  When they had arrived at\r\nwondering whether some poor person had been begging of Mrs Hope, or\r\nwhether one of Mr Hope\'s patients that she cared about was very ill, or\r\nwhether anybody had been telling her an affecting story, Miss Young\r\nbrought them to see that they ought not to wish to know;--that they\r\nshould no more desire to read Mrs Hope\'s thoughts than to look over her\r\nshoulder while she was writing a letter.  She was just telling them a\r\nstory of a friend of hers who called on an old gentleman, and found him\r\nin very low spirits, with his eyes all red and swollen; and how her\r\nfriend did not know whether to take any notice; and how the truth came\r\nout,--that the old gentleman had been reading a touching story:--she was\r\njust coming to the end of this anecdote, when the door opened and\r\nMargaret entered, holding George by the hand.  Margaret looked rather\r\ngrave, and said--\r\n\r\n"I thought I had better come to you first, Maria, for an explanation\r\nwhich you may be able to give.  Do you know who sent little George with\r\na message to my sister just now?  I concluded you did not.  George has\r\nbeen calling at my brother\'s door, with his papa\'s and mamma\'s\r\ncompliments, and a request to know what Mrs Hope was crying for\r\nyesterday, at four o\'clock."\r\n\r\nMaria covered her face with her hands, with as much shame as if she had\r\nbeen in fault, while "Oh, George!" was reproachfully uttered by the\r\nlittle girls.\r\n\r\n"Matilda," said Miss Young, "I trust you to go straight to your papa,\r\nwithout saying a word of this to any one else, and to ask him to come\r\nhere this moment.  I trust you, my dear."\r\n\r\nMatilda discharged her trust.  She peeped into the drawing-room, and\r\npopped out again without speaking, when she saw papa was no longer\r\nthere.  She found him in the office, and brought him, without giving any\r\nhint of what had happened.  He was full of concern, of course; said that\r\nhe could not blame George, though he was certainly much surprised; that\r\nit would be a lesson to him not to use irony with children, since even\r\nthe broadest might be thus misunderstood; and that a little family scene\r\nhad thus been laid open, which he should hardly regret if it duly\r\nimpressed his children with the folly and unkindness of village gossip.\r\nHe declared he could not be satisfied without apologising,--well, then,\r\nwithout explaining, to Mrs Hope how it had happened; and he would do it\r\nthrough the medium of Mr Hope; for, to say the truth, he was ashamed to\r\nface Mrs Hope till his peace was made.  Margaret laughed at this, and\r\nbegged him to go home with her; but he preferred stepping over to Mrs\r\nEnderby\'s, where Mr Hope had just been seen to enter.  Mr Rowland\r\nconcluded by saying, that he should accept it as a favour in Miss\r\nIbbotson, as well as Miss Young, if she would steadily refuse to gratify\r\nany impertinent curiosity shown by his children, in whatever direction\r\nit might show itself.  They were exposed to great danger from example in\r\nDeerbrook, like most children brought up in small villages, he supposed:\r\nand he owned he dreaded the idea of his children growing up the scourges\r\nto society that he considered foolish and malignant gossips to be.\r\n\r\n"Do sit down, Margaret," said Maria.  "I shall feel uncomfortable when\r\nyou are gone, if you do not stay a minute to turn our thoughts to\r\nsomething pleasanter than this terrible mistake of poor George\'s."\r\n\r\n"I cannot stay now, however," said Margaret, smiling.  "You know I must\r\ngo and turn my sister\'s thoughts to something pleasanter.  There she is,\r\nsitting at home, waiting to know how all this has happened."\r\n\r\n"Whether she has not been insulted?  You are right, Margaret.  Make\r\nhaste back to her, and beg her pardon for us all.  Shall she not,\r\nchildren, if she will be so kind?"\r\n\r\nMargaret was overwhelmed with the petitions for pardon she had to carry;\r\nand not one of the children asked what Mrs Hope had been crying for,\r\nafter all.\r\n\r\nHester looked up anxiously as Margaret entered the drawing-room at home.\r\n\r\n"It is all a trifle," said Margaret, gaily.\r\n\r\n"How can it be a trifle?"\r\n\r\n"The little Greys told what they saw yesterday, of course; and one of\r\nthe little Rowlands wondered what was the reason;--(children can never\r\nunderstand what grown people, who have no lessons to learn, can cry for,\r\nyou know); and Mr Rowland, to make their gossip ridiculous to\r\nthemselves, told them they had better come and ask; and poor George, who\r\ncannot take a joke, came without any one knowing where he was gone.\r\nThey were all in great consternation when I told them, and there is an\r\nample apology coming to you through Edward.  That is the whole story,\r\nexcept that Mr Rowland would have come himself to you, instead of going\r\nto your husband, but that he was ashamed of his joke.  So there is an\r\nend of that silly matter, unless it be to make George always ask\r\nhenceforth whether people are in joke or in earnest."\r\n\r\n"I think Mr Rowland might have come to me," observed Hester.  "Are you\r\nsure Mrs Rowland had nothing to do with it?"\r\n\r\n"I neither saw her nor heard of her.  You had better not go out to-day,\r\nit is so like snow.  I shall be back soon; but as I have my bonnet on, I\r\nshall go and see Johnny Rye and his mother.  Can I do anything for you?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, my snow-boots!  But I would not have you go to Mrs Howell\'s while\r\nshe is in such a mood as she was in yesterday.  I would not go myself."\r\n\r\n"Oh!  I will go.  I am not afraid of Mrs Howell; and we shall have to\r\nencounter her again, sooner or later.  I will buy something, and then\r\nsee what my diplomacy will effect about the boots."\r\n\r\nMr Hope presently came in, and found his wife prepared for the apology\r\nhe brought from Mr Rowland.  But it was obvious that Hope\'s mind was\r\nfar more occupied with something else.\r\n\r\n"Where is Margaret?"\r\n\r\n"She is gone out to Widow Rye\'s, and to Mrs Howell\'s."\r\n\r\n"No matter where, as long as she is out.  I want to consult you about\r\nsomething."  And he drew a chair to the fire, and told that he had\r\nvisited Mrs Enderby, whom he found very poorly, apparently from\r\nagitation of spirits.  She had shed a few tears on reporting her health,\r\nand had dropped something which he could not understand, about this\r\nbeing almost the last time she should be able to speak freely to him.\r\nHester anxiously hoped that the good old lady was not really going to\r\ndie.  There was no near probability of this, her husband assured her.\r\nHe thought Mrs Enderby referred to some other change than dying; but\r\nwhat, she did not explain.  She had gone on talking in rather an excited\r\nway, and at last hinted that she supposed she should not see her son for\r\nsome time, as Mrs Rowland had intimated that he was fully occupied with\r\nthe young lady he was going to be married to.  Mrs Enderby plainly said\r\nthat she had not heard this from Philip himself; but she seemed to\r\nentertain no doubt of the truth of the information she had received.\r\nShe appeared to be struggling to be glad at the news; but it was clear\r\nthat the uppermost feeling was disappointment at having no immediate\r\nprospect of seeing her son.\r\n\r\n"Now, what are we to think and do?" said Hope.\r\n\r\n"This agrees with what Mrs Rowland told me in Dingleford woods, six\r\nmonths ago," said Hester; "and I suppose what she then said may have\r\nbeen true all this time."\r\n\r\n"How does that agree with his conduct to Margaret?  Or am I mistaken in\r\nwhat I have told you I thought about that?  Seriously--very seriously--\r\nhow do you suppose the case stands with Margaret?"\r\n\r\n"I know no more than you.  I think he went further than he ought, if he\r\nwas thinking of another; and, but for his conduct since, I should have\r\nquite concluded, from some observations that I made, that he was\r\nattached to Margaret."\r\n\r\n"And she--?"\r\n\r\n"And she certainly likes him very well; but I can hardly fancy her\r\nhappiness at stake.  I have thought her spirit rather flat of late."\r\n\r\nHope sighed deeply.\r\n\r\n"Ah! you may well sigh," said Hester, sighing herself, and sinking back\r\nin her chair.  "You know what I am going to say.  I thought I might be\r\nthe cause of her being less gay than she should be.  I have disappointed\r\nher expectations, I know.  But let us talk only of her."\r\n\r\n"Yes: let us talk only of her, till we have settled what is our duty to\r\nher.  Ought we to tell her of this or not?"\r\n\r\nBoth considered long.  At length Hester said--\r\n\r\n"I think she ought to hear it quietly at home first (whether it be true\r\nor not), to prepare her for anything that may be reported abroad.\r\nPerhaps, if you were to drop, as we sit together here, what Mrs Enderby\r\nsaid--"\r\n\r\n"No, no; not I," said Hope, quickly.  He went on more calmly: "Her\r\nsister and bosom friend is the only person to do this--if, indeed, it\r\nought to be done.  But the news may be untrue; and then she need perhaps\r\nnever hear it.  Do not let us be in a hurry."\r\n\r\nHester thought that if Margaret felt nothing more than friendship for\r\nEnderby, she would still consider herself ill-used; for the friendship\r\nhad been so close an one that she might reasonably expect that she\r\nshould not be left to learn such an event as this from common report.\r\nBut was it certain, Hope asked, that she had anything new to learn?  Was\r\nit certain that she was not in his confidence all this time--that she\r\nhad not known ten times as much as Mrs Rowland from the beginning?\r\nCertainly not from the beginning, Hester said; and she had a strong\r\npersuasion that Margaret was as ignorant as themselves of Enderby\'s\r\npresent proceedings and intentions.\r\n\r\nAt this moment, a note was brought in.  It was from Mrs Enderby to Mr\r\nHope, written hurriedly, and blistered with tears.  It told that she had\r\nbeen extremely wrong in mentioning to him prematurely what was uppermost\r\nin her mind about a certain family affair, and begged the great favour\r\nof him to keep to himself what she had divulged, and, if possible, to\r\nforget it.  Once more, Mr Hope unconsciously sighed.  It was at the\r\nidea that he could forget such a piece of intelligence.\r\n\r\n"Poor old lady!" said Hester; "she has been taken to task, I suppose,\r\nfor relieving her mind to you.  But, Edward, this looks more and more as\r\nif the news were true.  My darling Margaret!  How will it be with her?\r\nDoes it not look too like being true, love?"\r\n\r\n"It looks as if Enderby\'s family all believed it, certainly.  This note\r\nsettles the matter of our duty, however.  If the affair is so private\r\nthat Mrs Enderby is to be punished for telling me, it is hardly likely\r\nthat Margaret will hear it by out-door chance.  You are spared the task\r\nfor the present at least, my dear!"\r\n\r\n"I should like to be sure that Margaret does not love--that she might\r\npass through life without loving," said Hester, sighing, "But here she\r\ncomes!  Burn the note!"\r\n\r\nThe note curled in the flames, was consumed, and its ashes fluttered up\r\nthe chimney, and Margaret did not enter.  She had gone straight\r\nup-stairs.  She did not come down till dinner was on the table.  She was\r\nthen prepared with the announcement that the snow-boots might be looked\r\nfor very soon.  She told of her visit to Widow Rye\'s, and had something\r\nto say of the probability of snow; but she was rather absent, and she\r\ntook wine.  These were all the circumstances that her anxious sister\r\ncould fix upon, during dinner, for silent comment.  After dinner, having\r\neaten an orange with something like avidity, Margaret withdrew for a\r\nvery few minutes.  As the door closed behind her, Hester whispered--\r\n\r\n"She has heard.  She knows.  Is it not so?"\r\n\r\n"There is no question about it," replied Hope, examining the screen he\r\nheld in his hand.\r\n\r\n"I wonder who can have told her."\r\n\r\n"Tellers of bad news are never wanting, especially in Deerbrook," said\r\nHope, with a bitterness of tone which Hester had never heard from him\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nMargaret took up the other screen when she returned, and played with it\r\ntill the table was cleared, so that she could have the use of her\r\nwork-box.  It was Morris who removed the dessert.\r\n\r\n"Morris," said Mr Hope, as she was leaving the room, "I want Charles:\r\npray send him."\r\n\r\n"Charles is out, sir."\r\n\r\n"Out! when will he be back?"\r\n\r\n"He will be back presently," said Margaret.  "I sent him with a note to\r\nMaria."\r\n\r\nAs she leant over her work again, Hester and her husband exchanged\r\nglances.\r\n\r\nAn answer from Maria soon arrived.  Margaret read it as she sat, her\r\nbrother and sister carefully withdrawing their observation from her.\r\nWhatever else might be in the note, she read aloud the latter part--two\r\nor three lines relating to the incident of the morning.  Her voice was\r\nhusky, but her manner was gay.  During the whole evening she was gay.\r\nShe insisted on making tea, and was too quick with the kettle for Edward\r\nto help her.  She proposed music, and she sang--song after song.  Hester\r\nwas completely relieved about her; and even Edward gave himself up to\r\nthe hope that all was well with her.  From music they got to dancing.\r\nMargaret had learned, by sitting with Maria during the children\'s\r\ndancing-lesson, a new dance which had struck her fancy, and they must be\r\nready with it next week at Dr Levitt\'s.  Alternately playing the dance\r\nand teaching it, she ran from the piano to them, and from them to the\r\npiano, till they were perfect, and her face was as flushed as it could\r\npossibly be at Mrs Levitt\'s dance next week.  But in the midst of this\r\nflush, Hope saw a shiver: and Hester remarked, that during the teaching,\r\nMargaret had, evidently without being aware of it, squeezed her hand\r\nwith a force which could not have been supposed to be in her.  These\r\nthings made Hope still doubt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY ONE.\r\n\r\nCONSCIOUSNESS TO THE UNCONSCIOUS.\r\n\r\nMr Hope might well doubt.  Margaret was not gay but desperate.  Yes,\r\neven the innocent may be desperate under circumstances of education and\r\ncustom, by which feelings natural and inevitable are made occasions of\r\nshame; while others, which are wrong and against the better nature of\r\nman, bask in daylight and impunity.  There was not a famishing wretch\r\nprowling about a baker\'s door, more desperate than Margaret this day.\r\nThere was not a gambler setting his teeth while watching the last turn\r\nof the die, more desperate than Margaret this day.  If there was a\r\ncriminal standing above a sea of faces with the abominable executioner\'s\r\nhands about his throat, Margaret was, for the time, as wretched as he.\r\n\r\nIf any asked why--why it should be thus with one who has done no wrong,\r\nthe answer is--Why is there pride in the human heart?--why is there a\r\nparticular nurture of this pride into womanly reserve?--Why is it that\r\nlove is the chief experience, and almost the only object, of a woman\'s\r\nlife?  Why is it that it is painful to beings who look before and after\r\nto have the one hope of existence dashed away--the generous faith\r\noutraged--all self-confidence overthrown--life in one moment made dreary\r\nas the desert--Heaven itself overclouded--and death all the while\r\nstanding at such a weary distance that there is no refuge within the\r\nhorizon of endurance?  Be these things right or wrong, they are: and\r\nwhile they are, will the woman who loves, unrequited, feel desperate on\r\nthe discovery of her loneliness--and, the more pure and proud, innocent\r\nand humble, the more lonely.\r\n\r\nFor some little time past, Margaret had been in a state of great\r\ntranquillity about Philip--a tranquillity which she now much wondered\r\nat--now that it was all over.  She had had an unconscious faith in him;\r\nand, living in this faith, she had forgotten herself, she had not\r\nthought of the future, she had not felt impatient for any change.  Often\r\nas she wished for his presence, irksome as she had sometimes felt it to\r\nknow nothing of him from week to week, she had been tacitly satisfied\r\nthat she was in his thoughts as he was in hers; and this had been enough\r\nfor the time.  What an awakening from this quiescent state was hers this\r\nday!\r\n\r\nIt was from no other than Dr Levitt that she had heard in the morning\r\nthat Mr Enderby was shortly going to be married to Miss Mary Bruce.\r\nDr Levitt was at Widow Rye\'s when Margaret went, and had walked part of\r\nthe way home with her.  During the walk, this piece of news had dropped\r\nout, while they were talking of Mrs Enderby\'s health.  All that Dr\r\nLevitt knew of Miss Mary Bruce was, that she was of sufficiently good\r\nfamily and fortune to make the Rowlands extremely well satisfied with\r\nthe match; that Mrs Enderby had never seen her, and that it would be\r\nsome time before she could see her, as the whole family of the Bruces\r\nwas at Rome for the winter.  When Dr Levitt parted from Margaret at the\r\ngate of the churchyard, these last words contained the hope she clung\r\nto--a hope which might turn into the deepest reason for despair.  Philip\r\nhad certainly not been abroad.  Was it likely that he should lately have\r\nbecome engaged to any young lady who had been some time in Rome?  It was\r\nnot likely: but then, if it was true, he must have been long engaged: he\r\nmust have been engaged at the time of his last visit of six days, when\r\nhe had talked over his views of life with Margaret, and been so anxious\r\nto obtain hers:--he must surely have been engaged in the summer, when\r\nshe found Tieck in the desk, and when he used to spend so many evenings\r\nat the Greys\'--certainly not on Hester\'s account.  At one moment she was\r\nconfident all this could not be; she was relieved; she stepped lightly.\r\nThe next moment, a misgiving came that it was all too true; the weight\r\nfell again upon her heart, she lost breath, and it was intolerable to\r\nhave to curtesy to Mrs James, and to answer the butcher\'s inquiry about\r\nthe meat that had been ordered.  If these people would only go on with\r\ntheir own business, and take no notice of her!  Then, again, the thought\r\noccurred, that she knew Philip better than any,--than even his own\r\nfamily; and that, say what they might, he was all her own.  In these\r\nchanges of mood, she had got through dinner; the dominant idea was then\r\nthat she must, by some means or other, obtain certainty.  She thought of\r\nMaria.  Maria was likely to know the facts, from her constant\r\nintercourse with the Rowlands, and besides, there was certainly a\r\nsomething in Maria\'s mind in relation to Philip,--a keen insight, which\r\nmight be owing to the philosophical habit of her mind, or to something\r\nelse,--but which issued in information about him, which it was\r\nsurprising that she could obtain.  She seldom spoke of him; but when she\r\ndid, it was wonderfully to the purpose.  Margaret thought she could\r\nlearn from Maria, in a very simple and natural way, that which she so\r\nmuch wished to know: and when she left the room after dinner, it was to\r\nwrite the note which might bring certainty.\r\n\r\n  "Dear Friend,--I saw Dr Levitt this morning while I was out, and he\r\n  told me, with all possible assurance, that Mr Enderby is going to be\r\n  married very shortly to a young lady at Rome,--Miss Mary Bruce.  Now,\r\n  this is true or it is not.  If true, you are as well aware as we are\r\n  that we are entitled to have known it otherwise and earlier than by\r\n  common report.  If not true, the rumour should not be allowed to\r\n  spread.  If you know anything certainly, one way or the other, pray\r\n  tell us.\r\n\r\n  "Yours affectionately,\r\n\r\n  "Margaret Ibbotson."\r\n\r\nThe "we" and "us" were not quite honest; but Margaret meant to make them\r\nas nearly so as possible by _ex-post-facto_ communication with her\r\nbrother and sister: a resolution so easily made, that it did not occur\r\nto her how difficult it might be to execute.  While her messenger was\r\ngone, she wrought herself up to a resolution to bear the answer,\r\nwhatever it might be, with the same quietness with which she must bear\r\nthe whole of her future life, if Dr Levitt\'s news should prove to be\r\nfounded in fact.  The door opening seemed to prick the nerves of her\r\nears: her heart heaved to her throat at the sight of the white paper:\r\nyet it was with neatness that she broke the seal, and with a steady hand\r\nthat she held the note to read it.  The handwriting was only too\r\ndistinct: it seemed to burn itself in upon her brain.  All was over.\r\n\r\n  "Dear Margaret,--I do not know where Dr Levitt got his news; but I\r\n  believe it is true.  Mrs Rowland pretends to absolute certainty about\r\n  her brother\'s engagement to Miss Bruce; and it is from this that\r\n  others speak so positively about it.  Whatever are the grounds that\r\n  Mrs R. goes upon, there are others which afford a strong presumption\r\n  that she is right.  Some of these may be known to you.  They leave no\r\n  doubt in my mind that the report is true.  As to the failure of\r\n  confidence in his friends,--what can be said?--unless by way of\r\n  reminder of the old truth that, by the blessing of Heaven, wrongs--be\r\n  they but deep enough--may chasten a human temper into something\r\n  divine.\r\n\r\n  "George has been very grave for the last three hours, pandering, I\r\n  fancy, what irony can be for.  Your sister will not grudge him his\r\n  lesson, though afforded at her expense.\r\n\r\n  "Yours affectionately,\r\n\r\n  "Maria Young."\r\n\r\n"Wrongs!" thought she;--"Maria goes too far when she speaks of wrongs.\r\nThere was nothing in my note to bring such an expression in answer.  It\r\nis going too far."\r\n\r\nThis was but the irritability of a racked soul, needing to spend its\r\nagony somewhere.  The remembrance of the conversation with Maria, held\r\nso lately, and of Maria\'s views of Philip\'s relation to her, returned\r\nupon her, and her soul melted within her.  She, felt that Maria had\r\nunderstood her better than she did herself; and was justified in the\r\nwords she had used.  Under severe calamity, to be endured alone, evil\r\nthoughts sometimes come before good ones.  Margaret was, for an hour or\r\ntwo, possessed with the bad spirit of defiance.  Her mind sank back into\r\nwhat it had been in her childhood, when she had hidden herself in the\r\nlumber-room, or behind the water-tub, for many hours, to make the family\r\nuneasy, because she had been punished,--in the days when she bore every\r\ninfliction that her father dared to try, with apparent unconcern, rather\r\nthan show to watchful eyes that she was moved,--in the days when the\r\nslightest concession would dissolve her stubbornness in an instant, but\r\nwhen, to get rid of a life of contradiction, she had had serious\r\nthoughts of cutting her throat, had gone to the kitchen door to get the\r\ncarving-knife, and had been much disappointed to find the servants at\r\ndinner, and the knife-tray out of reach.  This spirit, so long ago\r\ndriven out by the genial influences of family love, by the religion of\r\nan expanding intellect, and the solace of appreciation, now came back to\r\ninhabit the purified bosom which had been kept carefully swept and\r\ngarnished.  It was the motion of this spirit, uneasy in its unfit abode,\r\nthat showed itself by the shiver, the flushed cheek, the clenching hand,\r\nand the flashing eye.  It kept whispering wicked things,--"I will baffle\r\nand deceive Maria: she shall withdraw her pity, and laugh at it with\r\nme."  "I defy Edward and Hester: they shall wonder how it is that my\r\nfancy alone is free, that my heart alone is untouched, that the storms\r\nof life pass high over my head, and dare not lower."  "I will humble\r\nPhilip, and convince him..."  But, no; it would not do.  The abode was\r\ntoo lowly and too pure for the evil spirit of defiance: the demon did\r\nnot wait to be cast out; but as Margaret sat down in her chamber, alone\r\nwith her lot, to face it as she might, the strange inmate escaped, and\r\nleft her at least herself.\r\n\r\nMargaret was in agonised amazement at the newness of the misery she was\r\nsuffering.  She really fancied she had sympathised with Hester that\r\ndreadful night of Hope\'s accident: she had then actually believed that\r\nshe was entering into her sister\'s feelings.  It had been as much like\r\nit as seeing a picture of one on the rack is like being racked.  But\r\nHester had not had so much cause for misery, for she never had to\r\nbelieve Edward unworthy.  Her pride had been wounded at finding that her\r\npeace was no longer in her own power; but she had not been trifled\r\nwith--duped.  Here again Margaret refused to believe.  The fault was all\r\nher own.  She had been full of herself, full of vanity; fancying,\r\nwithout cause, that she was much to another when she was little.  She\r\nwas humbled now, and she no doubt deserved it.  But how ineffably weak\r\nand mean did she appear in her own eyes!  It was this which clouded\r\nHeaven to her at the moment that earth had become a desert.  She felt so\r\ndebased, that she durst not ask for strength where she was wont to find\r\nit.  If she had done one single wrong thing, she thought she could bear\r\nthe consequences cheerfully, and seek support, and vigorously set about\r\nrepairing the causes of her fault; but here it seemed to her that her\r\nwhole state of mind had been low and selfish.  It must be this sort of\r\nblindness which had led her so far in so fearful a delusion.  And if the\r\nwhole condition of her mind had been low and selfish, while her\r\nconscience had given her no hint of anything being amiss, where was she\r\nto begin to rectify her being?  She felt wholly degraded.\r\n\r\nAnd then what a set of pictures rose up before her excited fancy!\r\nPhilip going forth for a walk with her and Hester, after having just\r\nsealed a letter to Miss Bruce, carrying the consciousness of what he had\r\nbeen saying to the mistress of his heart, while she, Margaret, had\r\nsupposed herself the chief object of his thought and care!  Again,\r\nPhilip discussing her mind and character with Miss Bruce, as those of a\r\nfriend for whom he had a regard! or bestowing a passing imagination on\r\nhow she would receive the intelligence of his engagement!  Perhaps he\r\nreserved the news till he could come down to Deerbrook, and call and\r\ntell her himself, as one whose friendship deserved that he should be the\r\nbearer of his own tidings.  That footstep, whose spring she had\r\nstrangely considered her own signal of joy, was not hers but another\'s.\r\nThat laugh, the recollection of which made her smile even in these\r\ndreadful moments, was to echo in another\'s home.  She was stripped of\r\nall her heart\'s treasure, of his tones, his ways, his thoughts,--a\r\ntreasure which she had lived upon without knowing it; she was stripped\r\nof it all--cast out--left alone--and he and all others would go on their\r\nways, unaware that anything had happened!  Let them do so.  It was hard\r\nto bear up in solitude when self-respect was gone with all the rest; but\r\nit must be possible to live on--no matter how--if to live on was\r\nappointed.  If not, there was death, which was better.\r\n\r\nThese thoughts were not beneath one like Margaret--one who was religious\r\nas she.  It requires time for religion to avail anything when\r\nself-respect is utterly broken-down.  A devout sufferer may surmount the\r\npangs of persecution at the first onset, and wrestle with bodily pain,\r\nand calmly endure bereavement by death; but there is no power of faith\r\nby which a woman can attain resignation under the agony of unrequited\r\npassion otherwise than by conflict, long and terrible.\r\n\r\nMargaret laid down at last, because her eyes were weary of seeing; and\r\nshe would fain have shut out all sounds.  The occasional flicker of a\r\ntiny blaze, however, and the fall of a cinder in the hearth, served to\r\nlull her senses, and it was not long before she slept.  But, oh, the\r\nhorrors of that sleep!  The lines of Maria\'s note stared her in the\r\nface--glaring, glowing, gigantic.  Sometimes she was trying to read\r\nthem, and could not, though her life depended on them.  Now Mrs Rowland\r\nhad got hold of them; and now they were thrown into the flames, but\r\nwould not burn, and the letters grew red-hot.  Then came the image of\r\nPhilip; and that horror was mixed up with whatever was most ludicrous.\r\nOnce she was struggling for voice to speak to him, and he mocked her\r\nuseless efforts.  Oh, how she struggled! till some strong arm raised\r\nher, and some other voice murmured gently in her throbbing ear.\r\n\r\n"Wake, my dear!  Wake up, Margaret!  What is it, dear?  Wake!"\r\n\r\n"Mother! is it you?  Oh, mother! have you come at last?" murmured\r\nMargaret, sinking her head on Morris\' shoulder.\r\n\r\nIt was some moments before Margaret felt a warm tear fall upon her\r\ncheek, and heard Morris say:\r\n\r\n"No, my dear: not yet.  Your mother is in a better place than this,\r\nwhere we shall all rest with her at last, Miss Margaret."\r\n\r\n"What is all this?" said Margaret, raising herself, and looking round\r\nher.  "What did I mean about my mother?  Oh, Morris, my head is all\r\nconfused, and I think I have been frightened.  They were laughing at me,\r\nand when somebody came to help me, I thought it must be my mother.  Oh,\r\nMorris, it is a long while--I wish I was with her."\r\n\r\nMorris did not desire to hear what Margaret\'s dream had been.  The\r\nimmediate cause of Margaret\'s distress she did not know; but she had for\r\nsome time suspected that which only one person in the world was aware of\r\nbesides herself.  The terrible secret of this household was no secret to\r\nher.  She was experienced enough in love and its signs to know, without\r\nbeing told where love was absent, and where it rested.  She had not\r\ndoubted, up to the return from the wedding-trip, that all was right; but\r\nshe had never been quite happy since.  She had perceived no sign that\r\neither sister was aware of the truth; the continuance of their sisterly\r\nfriendship was a proof that neither of them was: but she wished to avoid\r\nhearing the particulars of Margaret\'s dream, and all revelations which,\r\nin the weakness and confusion of an hour like this, she might be tempted\r\nto make.  Morris withdrew from Margaret\'s clasp, moved softly across the\r\nroom, gently put the red embers together in the grate, and lighted the\r\nlamp which stood on the table.\r\n\r\n"I hope," whispered Margaret, trying to still her shivering, "that\r\nnobody heard me but you.  How came you to think of coming to me?"\r\n\r\n"My room being over this, you know, it was easy to hear the voice of a\r\nperson in an uneasy sleep.  I am glad I happened to be awake: so I put\r\non my cloak and came."\r\n\r\nMorris did not say that Edward had heard the stifled cry also, and that\r\nshe had met him on the stairs coming to beg that she would see what\r\ncould be done.  Hester having slept through it, Margaret need never know\r\nthat other ears than Morris\' had heard her.  Thus had Hope and Morris\r\ntacitly agreed.\r\n\r\n"Now, my dear, when I have warmed this flannel, to put about your feet,\r\nyou must go to sleep again.  I will not leave you till daylight--till\r\nthe house is near being astir: so you may sleep without being afraid of\r\nbad dreams.  I will rouse you if I see you disturbed.  Now, no more\r\ntalking, or we shall have the house up; and all this had better be\r\nbetween you and me."\r\n\r\nTo satisfy Margaret, Morris lay down on the outside of the bed, warmly\r\ncovered; and the nurse once more, as in old days, felt her favourite\r\nchild breathing quietly against her shoulder: once more she wiped away\r\nthe standing tears, and prayed in her heart for the object of her care.\r\nIf her prayer had had words, it would have been this:--\r\n\r\n"Thou hast been pleased to take to thyself the parents of these dear\r\nchildren; and surely thou wilt be therefore pleased to be to them as\r\nfather and mother, or to raise up or spare to them such as may be so.\r\nThis is what I would ask for myself; that I may be that comfort to them.\r\nThou knowest that a strange trouble hath entered this house--thou\r\nknowest, for thine eye seeth beneath the face into the heart, as the sun\r\nshines into a locked chamber at noon.  Thou knowest what these young\r\ncreatures know not.  Make holy to them what thou knowest.  Let thy\r\nsilence rest upon that which must not be spoken.  Let thy strength be\r\nsupplied where temptation is hardest.  Let the innocence which has come\r\nforth from thine own hand be kept fit to appear in all the light of thy\r\ncountenance.  Oh! let them never be seen sinking with shame before thee.\r\nFather, if thou hast made thy children to love one another for their\r\ngood, let not love be a grief and a snare to such as these.  Thou canst\r\nturn the hearts even of the wicked: turn the hearts of these thy dutiful\r\nchildren to love, where love may be all honour and no shame, so that\r\nthey may have no more mysteries from each other, as I am sure they have\r\nnone from thee.  All who know them have doubtless asked thy blessing on\r\ntheir house, their health, their basket and store: let me ask it also on\r\nthe workings of their hearts, since, if their hearts be right, all is\r\nwell--or will be in thine own best time."\r\n\r\nWhen Margaret entered the breakfast-room in the morning, she found her\r\nbrother sketching the skaters of Deerbrook, while the tea was brewing.\r\nHester was looking over his shoulder, laughing, as she recognised one\r\nafter another of her neighbours in the act of skating--this one by the\r\nstoop--that by the formality--and the other by the coat-flaps flying out\r\nbehind.  No inquiries were made--not a word was said of health or\r\nspirits.  It seems strange that sufferers have not yet found means to\r\nstop the practice of such inquiries--a practice begun in kindness, and\r\ncarried on in the spirit of hospitality, but productive of great\r\nannoyance to all but those who do not need such inquiries--the healthful\r\nand the happy.  There are multitudes of invalids who can give no\r\ncomfortable answer respecting their health, and who are averse from\r\ngiving an uncomfortable one, and for whom nothing is therefore left but\r\nevasion.  There are only too many sufferers to whom it is irksome to be\r\nquestioned about their hours of sleeplessness, or who do not choose to\r\nhave it known that they have not slept.  The unpleasant old custom of\r\npressing people to eat has gone out: the sooner the other observance of\r\nhospitality is allowed to follow it, the better.  All who like to tell\r\nof illness and sleeplessness can do so; and those who have reasons for\r\nreserve upon such points, as Margaret had this morning, can keep their\r\nown counsel.\r\n\r\nAt the earliest possible hour that the etiquette of Deerbrook would\r\nallow, there was a knock at the door.\r\n\r\n"That must be Mrs Rowland," exclaimed Hester.  "One may know that\r\nwoman\'s temper by her knock--so consequential, and yet so sharp.\r\nMargaret, love, you can run upstairs--there is time yet--if you do not\r\nwish to see her."\r\n\r\n"Why should I?" said Margaret, looking up with a calmness which\r\nperplexed Hester.\r\n\r\n"This is either ignorance," thought she, "or such patience as I wish I\r\nhad."\r\n\r\nIt _was_ Mrs Rowland, and she _was_ come to tell what Hester feared\r\nMargaret might not be able to bear to hear.  She was attended only by\r\nthe little fellow who was so fond of riding on Uncle Philip\'s shoulder.\r\nIt was rather lucky that Ned came, as Margaret was furnished with\r\nsomething to do in taking off his worsted gloves, and rubbing his little\r\nred hands between her own.  And then she could say a great many things\r\nto him about learning to slide, and the difficulty of keeping on the\r\nsnow-man\'s nose, and about her wonder that they had not thought of\r\nputting a pipe into his mouth.  Before this subject was finished, Mrs\r\nRowland turned full round to Margaret, and said that the purpose of her\r\nvisit was to explain fully something that her poor mother had let drop\r\nyesterday to Mr Hope.  Her mother was not what she had been--though,\r\nindeed, she had always been rather apt to let out things that she should\r\nnot.  She found that Mr Hope had been informed by her mother of her\r\nbrother Philip\'s engagement to a charming young lady, who would indeed\r\nbe a great ornament to the connexion.\r\n\r\n"I assure you," said Margaret, "my brother is very careful, and always\r\nremembers that he is upon honour as to what he hears in a sick-room.  He\r\nhas not mentioned it."\r\n\r\n"Oh! then it is safe.  We are much obliged to Mr Hope, I am sure.  I\r\nsaid to my mother--`My dear ma\'am,\'--"\r\n\r\n"But I must mention," said Margaret, "that the news was abroad before...\r\nI must beg that you will not suppose my brother has spoken of it, if\r\nyou should find that everybody knows it.  I heard it from Dr Levitt\r\nyesterday, about the same time, I fancy, that Mr Hope was hearing it\r\nfrom Mrs Enderby."\r\n\r\nHester sat perfectly still, to avoid all danger of showing that this was\r\nnews to her.\r\n\r\n"How very strange!" exclaimed the lady.  "I often say there is no\r\nkeeping anything quiet in Deerbrook.  Do you know where Dr Levitt got\r\nhis information?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Margaret, smiling.  "Dr Levitt generally knows what he is\r\ntalking about.  I dare say he had it from some good authority.  The\r\nyoung lady is at Rome, I find."\r\n\r\n"Are you acquainted with Miss Bruce?" asked Hester, thinking it time to\r\nrelieve Margaret of her share of the conversation.\r\n\r\nMargaret started a little on finding that her sister had heard the news.\r\nWas it possible that her brother and sister had been afraid to tell\r\nher?  No: it was a piece of Edward\'s professional discretion.  His wife\r\nalone had a right to the news he heard among his patients.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes!" replied Mrs Rowland; "I have long loved Mary as a sister.\r\nTheir early attachment made a sister of her to me an age ago."\r\n\r\n"It has been a long engagement, then," said Hester, glad to say anything\r\nwhich might occupy Mrs Rowland, as Margaret\'s lips were now turning\r\nvery white.\r\n\r\n"Not now, my dear," Margaret was heard to say to little Ned, over whom\r\nshe was bending her head as he stood by her side.  "Stand still here,"\r\nshe continued, with wonderful cheerfulness of tone; "I want to hear your\r\nmamma tell us about Uncle Philip."  With the effort her strength\r\nrallied, and the paleness was gone before Mrs Rowland had turned round.\r\n\r\n"How long the engagement has existed," said the lady, "I cannot venture\r\nto say.  I speak only of the attachment.  Young people understand their\r\nown affairs, you know, and have their little mysteries, and laugh behind\r\nour backs, I dare say, at our ignorance of what they are about.  Philip\r\nhas been sly enough as to this, I own: but I must say I had my\r\nsuspicions.  I was pretty confident of his being engaged from the day\r\nthat he told me in the summer, that he fully agreed with me that it was\r\ntime he was settled."\r\n\r\n"How differently some people understood that!" thought Hester and\r\nMargaret at the same moment.\r\n\r\n"Is Mr Enderby at Rome now?" asked Hester.\r\n\r\n"No: he is hard at work, studying law.  He is really going to apply to a\r\nprofession now.  Not that it would be necessary, for Mary has a very\r\ngood fortune.  But Mary wishes so much that he should--like a sensible\r\ngirl as she is."\r\n\r\n"It is what I urged when he consulted me," thought Margaret.  She had\r\nhad little idea whose counsel she was following up.\r\n\r\n"We shall soon hear of his setting off for the Continent, however, I\r\nhave no doubt," said the lady.\r\n\r\n"To bring home his bride," observed Margaret, calmly.\r\n\r\n"Why, I do not know that.  The Bruces will be returning early in the\r\nspring; and I should like the young people to marry in town, that we may\r\nhave them here for their wedding trip."\r\n\r\n"How you do hug me!" cried the laughing little boy, around whom\r\nMargaret\'s arm was passed.\r\n\r\n"Have I made you warm at last?" asked Margaret.  "If not, you may go and\r\nstand by the fire."\r\n\r\n"No, indeed; we must be going," said mamma.  "As I find this news is\r\nabroad, I must call on Mrs Grey.  She will take offence at once, if she\r\nhears it from anybody but me.  So much for people\'s husbands being\r\npartners in business!"\r\n\r\nMargaret was now fully qualified to comprehend her sister\'s\r\nirritability.  Every trifle annoyed her.  The rustle of Mrs Rowland\'s\r\nhandsome cloak almost made her sick; and she thought the hall clock\r\nwould never have done striking twelve.  When conscious of this, she put\r\na strong check upon herself.\r\n\r\nHester stood by the mantelpiece, looking into the fire, and taking no\r\nnotice of their mutual silence upon this piece of news.  At last she\r\nmuttered, in a soliloquising tone--\r\n\r\n"Do not know--but I am not sure this news is true, after all."\r\n\r\nAfter a moment\'s pause, Margaret replied--"I think that is not very\r\nreasonable.  What must one suppose of everybody else, if it is not\r\ntrue?"\r\n\r\nHester was going to say, "What must we think of him, if it is?" but she\r\nchecked herself.  She should not have said what she had; she felt this,\r\nand only replied--\r\n\r\n"Just so.  Yes; it must be true."\r\n\r\nMargaret\'s heart once more sank within her at this corroboration of her\r\nown remark.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY TWO.\r\n\r\nTHE MEADOWS IN WINTER.\r\n\r\nHester was tired of her snow-boots before she saw them.  She had spent\r\nmore trouble on them than they were worth; and it was three weeks yet\r\nbefore they came.  It was now past the middle of February--rather late\r\nin the season for snow-boots to arrive: but then there was Margaret\'s\r\nconsolatory idea, that they would be ready for next year\'s snow.\r\n\r\n"It is not too late yet," said Mr Hope.  "There is skating every day in\r\nthe meadow.  It will soon be over; so do not lose your opportunity.\r\nCome! let us go to-day."\r\n\r\n"Not unless the sun shines out," said Hester, looking with a shiver up\r\nat the windows.\r\n\r\n"Yes, to-day," said Edward, "because I have time to-day to go with you.\r\nYou have seen me quiz other skaters: you must go and see other skaters\r\nquiz me."\r\n\r\n"What points of your skating do they get hold of to quiz?" asked\r\nMargaret.\r\n\r\n"Why, I hardly know.  We shall see."\r\n\r\n"Is it so very good, then?"\r\n\r\n"No.  I believe the worst of my skating is, that it is totally devoid of\r\nevery sort of expression.  That is just the true account of it," he\r\ncontinued, as his wife laughed.  "I do not square my elbows, nor set my\r\ncoat flying, nor stoop, nor rear; but neither is there any grace.  I\r\njust go straight on; and, as far as I know, nobody ever bids any other\r\nbody look at me."\r\n\r\n"So you bid your own family come and look at you.  But how are your\r\nneighbours to quiz you if they do not observe you?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, that was only a bit of antithesis for effect.  My last account is\r\nthe true one, as you will see.  I shall come in for you at twelve."\r\n\r\nBy twelve the sun had shone out, and the ladies, booted, furred, and\r\nveiled, were ready to encounter the risks and rigours of the ice and\r\nsnow.  As they opened the hall door they met on the steps a young woman,\r\nwho was just raising her hand to the knocker.  Her errand was soon told.\r\n\r\n"Please, ma\'am, I heard that you wanted a servant."\r\n\r\n"That is true," said Hester.  "Where do you come from?--from any place\r\nnear, so that you can call again?"\r\n\r\n"Surely," said Margaret, "it is Mrs Enderby\'s Susan."\r\n\r\n"Yes, miss, I have been living with Mrs Enderby.  Mrs Enderby will\r\ngive me a good character, ma\'am."\r\n\r\n"Why are you leaving her, Susan?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, ma\'am, only because she is gone."\r\n\r\n"Gone!--where?--what do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"Gone to live at Mrs Rowland\'s, ma\'am.  You didn\'t know?--it _was_ very\r\nsudden.  But she moved yesterday, ma\'am, and we were paid off--except\r\nPhoebe, who stays to wait upon her.  I am left in charge of the house,\r\nma\'am: so I can step here again, if you wish it, some time when you are\r\nnot going out."\r\n\r\n"Do so; any time this evening, or before noon to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"Did you know of this, Edward?" said his wife, as they turned the\r\ncorner.\r\n\r\n"Not I.  I think Mrs Rowland is mistaken in saying that nothing can be\r\nkept secret in Deerbrook.  I do not believe anybody has dreamed of the\r\npoor old lady giving up her house."\r\n\r\n"Very likely Mrs Rowland never dreamed of it herself; till the day it\r\nwas done," observed Margaret.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, she did," said Mr Hope.  "I understand now the old lady\'s\r\nagitation, and the expressions she dropped about `last times\' nearly a\r\nmonth ago."\r\n\r\n"By-the-by, that was the last time you saw her--was it not?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; the next day when I called I was told that she was better, and\r\nthat she would send when she wished to see me again, to save me the\r\ntrouble of calling when she might be asleep."\r\n\r\n"She has been asleep or engaged every time I have inquired at the door\r\nof late," observed Margaret.  "I hope she is doing nothing but what she\r\nlikes in this change of plan."\r\n\r\n"I believe she finds most peace and quiet in doing what her daughter\r\nlikes," said Mr Hope.  "Here, Margaret, where are you going?  This is\r\nthe gate.  I believe you have not learned your way about yet."\r\n\r\n"I will follow you immediately," said Margaret: "I will only go a few\r\nsteps to see if this can really be true."\r\n\r\nBefore the Hopes had half crossed the meadow, Margaret joined them,\r\nperfectly convinced.  The large bills in the closed windows of Mrs\r\nEnderby\'s house bore "To be Let or Sold" too plainly to leave any doubt.\r\n\r\nAs the skating season was nearly over, all the skaters in Deerbrook were\r\neager to make use of their remaining opportunities, and the banks of the\r\nbrook and of the river were full of their wives, sisters, and children.\r\nSydney Grey was busy cutting figures-of-eight before the eyes of his\r\nsisters, and in defiance of his mother\'s careful warnings not to go\r\nhere, and not to venture there, and not to attempt to cross the river.\r\nMr Hope begged his wife to engage Mrs Grey in conversation, so that\r\nSydney might be left free for a while, and promised to keep near the boy\r\nfor half an hour, during which time Mrs Grey might amuse herself with\r\nwatching other and better performers further on.  As might have been\r\nforeseen, however, Mrs Grey could talk of nothing but Mrs Enderby\'s\r\nremoval, of which she had not been informed till this morning, and which\r\nshe had intended to discuss in Hester\'s house, on leaving the meadows.\r\n\r\nIt appeared that Mrs Enderby had been in agitated and variable spirits\r\nfor some time, apparently wishing to say something that she did not say,\r\nand expressing a stronger regard than ever for her old friends--a\r\nregular sign that some act of tyranny or rudeness might speedily be\r\nexpected from Mrs Rowland.  The Greys were in the midst of their\r\nspeculations, as to what might be coming to pass, when Sydney burst in,\r\nwith the news that Mrs Enderby\'s house was to be "Let or Sold."  Mrs\r\nGrey had mounted her spectacles first, to verify the fact, and then sent\r\nAlice over to inquire, and had immediately put on her bonnet and cloak,\r\nand called on her old friend at Mrs Rowland\'s.  She had been told at\r\nthe door that Mrs Enderby was too much fatigued with her removal to see\r\nany visitors.  "So I shall try again to-morrow," concluded Mrs Grey.\r\n\r\n"How does Mr Hope think her spasms have been lately?" asked Sophia.\r\n\r\n"He has not seen her for nearly a month; so I suppose they are better."\r\n\r\n"I fear that does not follow, my dear," said Mrs Grey, winking.  "Some\r\npeople are afraid of your husband\'s politics, you are aware; and I know\r\nMrs Rowland has been saying and doing things on that score which you\r\nhad better not hear about.  I have my reasons for thinking that the old\r\nlady\'s spasms are far from being better.  But Mrs Rowland has been so\r\nbusy crying up those drops of hers, that cure everything, and praising\r\nher maid, that I have a great idea your husband will not be admitted to\r\nsee her till she is past cure, and her daughter thoroughly frightened.\r\nMr Hope has never been forgiven, you know, for marrying into our\r\nconnection so decidedly.  And I really don\'t know what would have been\r\nthe consequence, if, as we once fancied likely, Mr Philip and Margaret\r\nhad thought of each other."\r\n\r\nMargaret was happily out of hearing.  A fresh blow had just been struck.\r\nShe had looked to Mrs Enderby for information on the subject which for\r\never occupied her, and on which she felt that she must know more or\r\nsink.  She had been much disappointed at being refused admission to the\r\nold lady, time after time.  Now all hope of free access and private\r\nconversation was over.  She had set it as an object before her to see\r\nMrs Enderby, and learn as much of Philip\'s affair as his mother chose\r\nto offer: now this object was lost, and nothing remained to be done or\r\nhoped--for it was too certain that Mrs Enderby\'s friends would not be\r\nallowed unrestrained intercourse with her in her daughter\'s house.\r\n\r\nFor some little time Margaret had been practising the device, so\r\nfamiliar to the unhappy, of carrying off mental agitation by bodily\r\nexertion.  She was now eager to be doing something more active than\r\nwalking by Mrs Grey\'s side, listening to ideas which she knew just as\r\nwell without their being spoken.  Mrs Grey\'s thoughts about Mrs\r\nRowland, and Mrs Rowland\'s ideas of Mrs Grey, might always be\r\nanticipated by those who knew the ladies.  Hester and Margaret had\r\nlearned to think of something else, while this sort of comment was\r\nproceeding, and to resume their attention when it came to an end.\r\nMargaret had withdrawn from it now, and was upon the ice with Sydney.\r\n\r\n"Why, cousin Margaret, you don\'t mean that you are afraid of walking on\r\nthe ice?" cried Sydney, balancing himself on his heels.  "Mr Hope, what\r\ndo you think of that?" he called out, as Hope skimmed past them.\r\n"Cousin Margaret is afraid of going on the ice!"\r\n\r\n"What does she think can happen to her?" asked Mr Hope, his last words\r\nvanishing in the distance.\r\n\r\n"It looks so grey, and clear, and dark, Sydney."\r\n\r\n"Pooh!  It is thick enough between you and the water.  You would have to\r\nget down a good way, I can tell you, before you could get drowned."\r\n\r\n"But it is so slippery!"\r\n\r\n"What of that?  What else did you expect with ice?  If you tumble, you\r\ncan get up again.  I have been down three times this morning."\r\n\r\n"Well, that is a great consolation, certainly.  Which way do you want me\r\nto walk?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, any way.  Across the river to the other bank, if you like.  You\r\nwill remember next summer, when we come this way in a boat, that you\r\nhave walked across the very place."\r\n\r\n"That is true," said Margaret.  "I will go if Sophia will go with me."\r\n\r\n"There is no use in asking any of them," said Sydney.  "They stand\r\ndawdling and looking, till their lips and noses are all blue and red,\r\nand they are never up to any fun."\r\n\r\n"I will try as far as that pole first," said Margaret.  "I should not\r\ncare if they had not swept away all the snow here, so as to make the ice\r\nlook so grey and slippery."\r\n\r\n"That pole!" said Sydney.  "Why, that pole is put up on purpose to show\r\nthat you must not go there.  Don\'t you see how the ice is broken all\r\nround it?  Oh, I know how it is that you are so stupid and cowardly\r\nto-day.  You\'ve lived in Birmingham all your winters, and you\'ve never\r\nbeen used to walk on the ice."\r\n\r\n"I am glad you have found that out at last.  Now, look--I am really\r\ngoing.  What a horrid sensation!" she cried, as she cautiously put down\r\none foot before the other on the transparent floor.  She did better when\r\nshe reached the middle of the river, where the ice had been ground by\r\nthe skates.\r\n\r\n"Now, you would get on beautifully," said Sydney, "if you would not look\r\nat your feet.  Why can\'t you look at the people, and the trees\r\nopposite?"\r\n\r\n"Suppose I should step into a hole."\r\n\r\n"There are no holes.  Trust me for the holes.  What do you flinch so\r\nfor?  The ice always cracks so, in one part or another.  I thought you\r\nhad been shot."\r\n\r\n"So did I," said she, laughing.  "But, Sydney, we are a long way from\r\nboth banks."\r\n\r\n"To be sure: that is what we came for."\r\n\r\nMargaret looked somewhat timidly about her.  An indistinct idea flitted\r\nthrough her mind--how glad she should be to be accidentally, innocently\r\ndrowned; and scarcely recognising it, she proceeded.\r\n\r\n"You get on well," shouted Mr Hope, as he flew past, on his return up\r\nthe river.\r\n\r\n"There, now," said Sydney, presently; "it is a very little way to the\r\nbank.  I will just take a trip up and down, and come for you again, to\r\ngo back; and then we will try whether we can\'t get cousin Hester over,\r\nwhen she sees you have been safe there and back."\r\n\r\nThis was a sight which Hester was not destined to behold.  Margaret had\r\nan ignorant partiality for the ice which was the least grey; and, when\r\nleft to herself, she made for a part which looked less like glass.\r\nNobody particularly heeded her.  She slipped, and recovered herself: she\r\nslipped again, and fell, hearing the ice crack under her.  Every time\r\nshe attempted to rise, she found the place too slippery to keep her\r\nfeet; next, there was a hole under her; she felt the cold water--she was\r\nsinking through; she caught at the surrounding edges--they broke away.\r\nThere was a cry from the bank, just as the death-cold waters seemed to\r\nclose all round her, and she felt the ice like a heavy weight above her.\r\nOne thought of joy--"It will soon be all over now"--was the only\r\nexperience she was conscious of.\r\n\r\nIn two minutes more, she was breathing the air again, sitting on the\r\nbank, and helping to wring out her clothes.  How much may pass in two\r\nminutes!  Mr Hope was coming up the river again, when he saw a bustle\r\non the bank, and slipped off his skates, to be ready to be of service.\r\nHe ran as others ran, and arrived just when a dark-blue dress was\r\nemerging from the water, and then a dripping fur tippet, and then the\r\nbonnet, making the gradual revelation to him who it was.  For one\r\ninstant he covered his face with his hands, half-hiding an expression of\r\nagony so intense that a bystander who saw it, said, "Take comfort, sir:\r\nshe has been in but a very short time.  She\'ll recover, I don\'t doubt."\r\nHope leaped to the bank, and received her from the arms of the men who\r\nhad drawn her out.  The first thing she remembered was hearing, in the\r\nlowest tone she could conceive of--"Oh, God! my Margaret!" and a groan,\r\nwhich she felt rather than heard.  Then there were many warm and busy\r\nhands about her head--removing her bonnet, shaking out her hair, and\r\nchafing her temples.  She sighed out, "Oh, dear!" and she heard that\r\nsoft groan again.  In another moment she roused herself, sat up, saw\r\nHope\'s convulsed countenance, and Sydney standing motionless and deadly\r\npale.\r\n\r\n"I shall never forgive myself," she heard her brother exclaim.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I am very well," said she, remembering all about it.  "The air\r\nfeels quite warm.  Give me my bonnet.  I can walk home."\r\n\r\n"Can you?  The sooner the better, then," said Hope, raising her.\r\n\r\nShe could stand very well, but the water was everywhere dripping from\r\nher clothes.  Many bystanders employed themselves in wringing them out;\r\nand in the meanwhile Margaret inquired for her sister, and hoped she did\r\nnot know of the accident.  Hester did not know of it, for Margaret\r\nhappened to be the first to think of any one but herself.\r\n\r\nSydney was flying off to report, when he was stopped and recalled.\r\n\r\n"You must go to her, Edward," said Margaret, "or she will be frightened.\r\nYou can do me no good.  Sydney will go home with me, or any one here, I\r\nam sure."  Twenty people stepped forward at the word.  Margaret parted\r\nwith her heavy fur tippet, accepted a long cloth cloak from a poor\r\nwoman, to throw over her wet clothes, selected Mr Jones, the butcher,\r\nfor her escort, sent Sydney forward with directions to Morris to warm\r\nher bed, and then she set forth homeward.  Mr Hope and half a dozen\r\nmore would see her across the ice; and by the time she had reached the\r\nother bank, she was able to walk very much as if nothing had happened.\r\n\r\nMr Hope had perfectly recovered his composure before he reached the\r\nsomewhat distant pond where Hester and the Greys were watching sliding\r\nas good as could be seen within twenty miles.  It had reached\r\nperfection, like everything else, in Deerbrook.\r\n\r\n"What! tired already?" said Hester to her husband.  "What have you done\r\nwith your skates?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I have left them somewhere there, I suppose."  He drew her arm\r\nwithin his own.  "Come, my dear, let us go home.  Margaret is gone."\r\n\r\n"Gone!  Why?  Is not she well?  It is not so very cold."\r\n\r\n"She has got wet, and she has gone home to warm herself."  Hester did\r\nnot wait to speak again to the Greys when she comprehended that her\r\nsister had been in the river.  Her husband was obliged to forbid her\r\nwalking so fast, and assured her all the way that there was nothing to\r\nfear.  Hester reproached him for his coolness.\r\n\r\n"You need not reproach me," said he.  "I shall never cease to reproach\r\nmyself for letting her go where she did."  And yet his heart told him\r\nthat he had only acted according to his deliberate design of keeping\r\naloof from all Margaret\'s pursuits and amusements that were not shared\r\nwith her sister.  And as for the risk, he had seen fifty people walking\r\nacross the ice this very morning.  Judging by the event, however, he\r\nvery sincerely declared that he should never forgive himself for having\r\nleft her.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached home, Margaret was quite warm and comfortable, and her\r\nhair drying rapidly under Morris\'s hands.  Hester was convinced that\r\neverybody might dine as usual.  Margaret herself came down-stairs to\r\ntea; and the only consequence of the accident seemed to be, that Charles\r\nwas kept very busy opening the door to inquirers how Miss Ibbotson was\r\nthis evening.\r\n\r\nIt made Hope uneasy to perceive how much Margaret remembered of what had\r\npassed around her in the midst of the bustle of the morning.  If she was\r\nstill aware of some circumstances that she mentioned, might she not\r\nretain others--the words extorted from him, the frantic action which he\r\nnow blushed to remember?\r\n\r\n"Brother," said she, "what _was_ the meaning of something that I heard\r\nsome one say, just as I sat up on the bank?  `There\'s a baulk for the\r\ndoctor!  He is baulked of a body in his own house.\'"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Margaret," cried her sister, who sat looking at her all the evening\r\nas if they had been parted for ten years, "you dreamed that.  It was a\r\nfancy.  Think what a state your poor head was in!  It may have a few\r\nstrange imaginations left in it still.  May it not, Edward?"\r\n\r\n"This is not one," he replied.  "She heard very accurately."\r\n\r\n"What did they mean?"\r\n\r\n"There is a report abroad about me, arising out of the old prejudice\r\nabout dissection.  Some of my neighbours think that dissecting is the\r\nemployment and the passion of my life, and that I rob the churchyard as\r\noften as anybody is buried."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Edward! how frightful! how ridiculous!"\r\n\r\n"It is very disagreeable, my dear.  I am taunted with this wherever I\r\ngo."\r\n\r\n"What is to be done?"\r\n\r\n"We must wait till the prejudices against me die out: but I see that we\r\nshall have to wait some time; for before one suspicion is given up,\r\nanother rises."\r\n\r\n"Since that unhappy election," said Hester, sighing.  "What a strange\r\nthing it is that men like you should be no better treated!  Here is Mrs\r\nEnderby taken out of your hands, and your neighbours suspecting and\r\nslandering you, whose commonest words they are not worthy to repeat."\r\n\r\n"My dear Hester!" said he, in a tone of serious remonstrance.  "That is\r\nrather a wife-like way of putting the case, to be sure," said Margaret,\r\nsmiling: "but, in as far as it is true, the matter surely ceases to be\r\nstrange.  Good men do not come into the world to be what the world calls\r\nfortunate, but to be something far better.  The best men do not use the\r\nmeans to be rich, to be praised by their neighbours, to be out of the\r\nway of trouble; and if they will not use the means, it does not become\r\nthem--nor their wives--to be discouraged at losing their occupation, or\r\nbeing slandered, or suspected as dangerous people."\r\n\r\nEdward\'s smile thanked her, and so did her sister\'s kiss.  But Hester\r\nlooked grave again when she said--"I suppose we shall know, sooner or\r\nlater, why it is that good people are not to be happy here, and that the\r\nmore they love one another, the more struggles and sorrows they have to\r\nundergo."\r\n\r\n"Do we not know something of it already?" said Hope, after a pretty long\r\npause.  "Is it not to put us off from the too vehement desire of being\r\nwhat we commonly call happy?  By the time higher things become more\r\ninteresting to us than this, we begin to find that it is given to us to\r\nput our own happiness under our feet, in reaching forward to something\r\nbetter.  We become, by natural consequence, practised in this (forgetful\r\nof the things that are behind); and if the practice be painful, what\r\nthen?  We shall not quarrel with it, surely, unless we are willing to\r\nexchange what we have gained for money, and praise, and animal spirits,\r\nshutting in an abject mind."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, no!" said Hester; "but yet there are troubles--" She stopped\r\nshort on observing Margaret\'s quivering lip.\r\n\r\n"There are troubles, I own, which it is difficult to classify and\r\ninterpret," said her husband.  "We can only struggle through them,\r\ntaking the closest heed to our innocence.  But these affairs of ours--\r\nthese mistakes of my neighbours--are not of that sort.  They are\r\nintelligible enough, and need not therefore trouble us much."\r\n\r\nHope was right in his suspicion of the accuracy of Margaret\'s memory.\r\nHis tones, his words, had sunk deep into her heart--her innocent heart--\r\nin which everything that entered it became safe and pure as itself.  "Oh\r\nGod! my Margaret!" sounded there like music.\r\n\r\n"What a heart he has!" she thought.  "I was very selfish to fancy him\r\nreserved; and I am glad to know that my brother loves me so.  If it is\r\nsuch a blessing to be his sister, how happy must Hester be--in spite of\r\neverything!  God has preserved my life, and He has given these two to\r\neach other!  And, oh, how He has shown me that they love me!  I will\r\nrouse myself, and try to suffer less."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY THREE.\r\n\r\nMOODS OF THE MIND.\r\n\r\nHester\'s sleeping as well as waking thoughts were this night full of\r\nsolicitude as to her feelings and conduct towards her sister.  A\r\nthousand times before the morning she had said to herself, in dreams and\r\nin meditation, that she had failed in this relation--the oldest, and,\r\ntill of late, the dearest.  She shuddered to think how nearly she had\r\nlost Margaret; and to imagine what her state of mind would have been, if\r\nher sister had now been beyond the reach of the voice, the eye, the\r\nhand, which she was resolved should henceforth dispense to her nothing\r\nbut the love and the benefits she deserved.  She reflected that to few\r\nwas granted such a warning of the death of beloved ones: to few was it\r\npermitted to feel, while it was yet not too late, the agony of remorse\r\nfor pain inflicted, for gratifications withheld; for selfish neglect,\r\nfor insufficient love.  She remembered vividly what her emotions had\r\nbeen as a child, on finding her canary dead in its cage;--how she had\r\nwept all day, not so much for its loss as from the recollection of the\r\nmany times when she had failed to cheer it with sugar, and groundsel,\r\nand play, and of the number of hours when she had needlessly covered up\r\nits cage in impatience at its song, shutting out its sunshine, and\r\nchanging the brightest seasons of its little life into dull night.  If\r\nit had been thus with her sister!  Many a hasty word, many an unjust\r\nthought, came back now to wring her heart, when she imagined Margaret\r\nsinking in the water,--the soft breathing on which our life so\r\nmarvellously hangs, stopped without struggle or cry.  How near--how very\r\nnear, had Death, in his hovering, stooped towards their home!  How\r\nstrange, while treading thus precariously the film which covers the\r\nabyss into which all must some day drop, and which may crack under the\r\nfeet of any one at any hour,--how strange to be engrossed with petty\r\njealousies, with selfish cares, and to be unmindful of the great\r\ninterests of existence, the exercises of mutual love and trust!  Thank\r\nGod! it was not too late.  Margaret lived to be cherished, to be\r\nconsoled for her private griefs, as far as consolation might be\r\npossible; to have her innocent affections redeemed from the waste to\r\nwhich they now seemed doomed,--gathered gradually up again, and knit\r\ninto the interests of the home life in which she was externally bearing\r\nher part.  Full of these thoughts, and forgetting how often her best\r\nfeelings had melted away beneath the transient heats kindled by the\r\nlittle provocations of daily life, Hester now believed that Margaret\r\nwould never have to suffer from her more,--that their love would be\r\nhenceforth like that of angels,--like that which it would have been if\r\nMargaret had really died yesterday.  It was yet early, when, in the full\r\nenjoyment of these undoubting thoughts, Hester stood by her sister\'s\r\nbedside.\r\n\r\nMargaret was still sleeping, but with that expression of weariness in\r\nher face which had of late become too common.  Hester gazed long at the\r\ncountenance, grieving at the languor and anxiety which it revealed.  She\r\nhad not taken Margaret\'s suffering to heart,--she had been unfeeling,--\r\nstrangely forgetful.  She would minister to her now with reverent care.\r\nAs she thus resolved, she bent down, and kissed her forehead.  Margaret\r\nstarted, shook off sleep, felt quite well, would rise;--there was no\r\nreason why she should not rise at once.\r\n\r\nWhen she entered the breakfast-room, Hester was there, placing her chair\r\nby the fire, and inventing indulgences for her, as if she had been an\r\ninvalid.  It was in vain that Margaret protested that no effects of the\r\naccident remained,--not a single sensation of chill: she was to be taken\r\ncare of; and she submitted.  She was touched by her sister\'s gentle\r\noffices, and felt more like being free and at peace, more like being\r\nlifted up out of her woe, than she had yet done since the fatal hour\r\nwhich rendered her conscious and wretched.  Breakfast went on\r\ncheerfully.  The fire blazed bright: the rain pelting against the\r\nwindows gave welcome promise of exemption from inquiries in person, and\r\nfrom having to relate, many times over, the particulars of the event of\r\nyesterday.  Hester was beautiful in all the glow of her sensibilities,\r\nand Edward was for this morning in no hurry.  No blue or yellow backed\r\npamphlet lay beside his plate; and when his last cup was empty, he still\r\nsat talking as if he forgot that he should have to go out in the rain.\r\nIn the midst of a laugh which had prevented their hearing a premonitory\r\nknock, the door opened, and Mrs Grey\'s twin daughters entered, looking\r\nhalf-shy, half-eager.  Never before had they been known to come out in\r\nheavy rain: but they were so very desirous to see cousin Margaret after\r\nshe had been in the water!--and Sydney had held the great gig umbrella\r\nover himself and them, as papa would not hear of Sydney not coming:--he\r\nwas standing outside the door now, under the large umbrella, for he said\r\nnothing should make him come in and see cousin Margaret--he would never\r\nsee her again if he could help it.  Sydney had said another thing,--such\r\na wicked thing!  Mamma was quite ashamed of him.  Mr Hope thought they\r\nhad better not repeat anything wicked that any one had said: but Hester\r\nconsidered it possible that it might not appear so wicked if spoken as\r\nif left to the imagination.  What Sydney had said was, that if cousin\r\nMargaret had been really drowned, he would have drowned himself before\r\ndinner-time.  Mary added that she heard him mutter that he was almost\r\nready to do it now.  Mr Hope thought that must be the reason why he was\r\nstanding out at present, to catch all this rain, which was very nearly\r\nenough to drown anybody; and he went to bring him in.  But Sydney was\r\nnot to be caught.  He was on the watch; and the moment he saw Mr Hope\'s\r\ncoat instead of his sisters\' cloaks, he ran off with a speed which\r\ndefied pursuit, and was soon out of sight with the large umbrella.\r\n\r\nHis cousins were sorry that he felt the event so painfully, and that he\r\ncould not come in and confide his trouble of mind to them.  Hope\r\nresolved not to let the morning pass without seeing him, and, if\r\npossible, bringing him home to dinner, with William Levitt to take off\r\nthe awkwardness.\r\n\r\n"What are we to do?" exclaimed Sydney\'s little sisters.  "He has carried\r\noff the great umbrella."\r\n\r\n"I cannot conveniently send you, just at present," said Hester; "so you\r\nhad better put off your cloaks, and amuse yourselves here till the rain\r\nabates, or some one comes for you.  We will speak to Miss Young to\r\nexcuse your not being with her."\r\n\r\n"Oh, cousin Margaret," said the children, "if you will speak to Miss\r\nYoung, she will give us any sort of a holiday.  She minds everything you\r\nsay.  She will let us stop all day, and dine here, if you ask her."\r\n\r\nHester said she could not have them stay all day,--she did not mean to\r\nhave them to dinner: and the little girls both looked up in her face at\r\nonce, to find out what made her speak so angrily.  They saw cousin\r\nMargaret glancing the same way too.\r\n\r\n"Do you know, Mary," said Fanny, "you have not said a word yet of what\r\nMiss Young bade you say?"\r\n\r\nMary told cousin Margaret, that Miss Young was wishing very much to see\r\nher, and would be pleased if Margaret would mention what evening she\r\nwould spend with her,--a nice long evening, Mary added, to begin as soon\r\nas it grew dark, and on till--nobody knew when.\r\n\r\n"Maria had better come here," observed Hester, quickly; "and then some\r\none else besides Margaret may have the benefit of her conversation.  She\r\nseems to forget that anybody cares for her besides Margaret.  Tell Miss\r\nYoung she had better fix an evening to come here."\r\n\r\n"I do not think she will do that," said both the little girls.\r\n\r\n"Why not?"\r\n\r\n"She is very lame now," replied Mary, "and she cannot walk further than\r\njust to school and back again."\r\n\r\n"And, besides," remarked Fanny, "she wants to talk with cousin Margaret\r\nalone, I am sure.  They have such a great deal of talk to do whenever\r\nthey are together!  We watch them sometimes in the schoolroom, through\r\nthe window, when we are at play in the garden; and their heads nod at\r\none another in this way.  I believe they never leave off for a minute.\r\nWe often wonder what it can be all about."\r\n\r\n"Ah, my dears, you and I had better not ask," said Hester.  "I have no\r\ndoubt it is better that we should not know."\r\n\r\nMargaret looked beseechingly at her sister.  Hester replied to her look:\r\n\r\n"I mean what I say, Margaret.  You cannot but be aware how much more you\r\nhave to communicate to Maria than to me.  Our conversation soon comes to\r\na stand: and I must say I have had much occasion to admire your great\r\ntalent for silence of late.  Maria has still to learn your\r\naccomplishments in that direction, I fancy."\r\n\r\nMargaret quietly told the little girls that she would write a note to\r\nMaria, with her answer.\r\n\r\n"You must not do that," said Fanny.  "Miss Young said you must not.\r\nThat was the reason why she sent you a message instead of a note--that\r\nyou might not have to write back again, when a message would do as\r\nwell."\r\n\r\nMargaret, nevertheless, sat down at the writing-table.\r\n\r\n"You go to-day, of course," said Hester, in the voice of forced calmness\r\nwhich Margaret knew so well.  "The little girls may as well stay and\r\ndine, after all, as I shall otherwise be alone in the evening."\r\n\r\n"I shall not go to-day," said Margaret, without turning her head.\r\n\r\n"You will not stay away on my account, of course."\r\n\r\n"I have said that I shall go on Thursday."\r\n\r\n"Thursday! that is almost a week hence.  Now, Margaret, do not be\r\npettish, and deny yourself what you know you like best.  Do not be a\r\nbaby, and quarrel with your supper.  I had far rather you should go\r\nto-night, and have done with it, than that you should wait till\r\nThursday, thinking all day long till then that you are obliging me by\r\nstaying with me.  I cannot bear that."\r\n\r\n"I wish I knew what you could bear," said Margaret, in a voice which the\r\nchildren could not hear.  "I wish I knew how I could save you pain."\r\n\r\nThe moment the words were out, Margaret was sorry for them.  She was\r\naware that the best kindness to her sister was to take as little notice\r\nas possible of her discontents--to turn the conversation--to avoid\r\nscenes, or any remarks which could bring them on.  It was hard--\r\nsometimes it seemed impossible--to speak calmly and lightly, while every\r\npulse was throbbing, and every fibre trembling with fear and\r\nwretchedness; but yet it was best to assume such calmness and lightness.\r\nMargaret now asked the little girls, while she sealed her note, how\r\ntheir patchwork was getting on--thus far the handsomest patchwork quilt\r\nshe had ever seen.\r\n\r\n"Oh, it will be far handsomer before it is done.  Mrs Howell has found\r\nup some beautiful pieces of print for us--remnants of her first\r\nmorning-gown after she was married, and of her poor dear Howell\'s last\r\ndressing-gown, as she says.  We were quite sorry to take those; but she\r\nwould put them up for us; and she is to see the quilt sometimes in\r\nreturn."\r\n\r\n"But Miss Nares\'s parcel was the best, cousin Margaret.  Such a quantity\r\nof nankeen for the ground, and the loveliest chintz for the centre\r\nmedallion!  Is not it, Mary?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, lovely!  Do you know, cousin Margaret, Miss Nares and Miss Flint\r\nboth cried when they heard how nearly you were drowned!  I am sure, I\r\nhad no idea they would have cared so much."\r\n\r\n"Nor I, my dear.  But I dare say they feel kindly towards anyone saved\r\nfrom great danger."\r\n\r\n"Not everybody," said Fanny; "only you, because you are a great\r\nfavourite.  Everybody says you are a great favourite.  Papa cried last\r\nnight--just a little tear or two, as gentlemen do--when he told mamma\r\nhow sorry everybody in Deerbrook would have been if you had died."\r\n\r\n"There! that will do," said Hester, struggling between her better and\r\nworse feelings--her remorse of this morning, and her present jealousy--\r\nand losing her temper between the two.  "You have said quite enough\r\nabout what you do not understand, my dears.  I cannot have you make so\r\nfree with your cousin\'s name, children."\r\n\r\nThe little girls looked at each other in wonder; and Hester thought she\r\ndetected a lurking smile.\r\n\r\n"I see what you are thinking, children.  Yes, look, the rain is nearly\r\nover; and then you may go and tell Mrs Howell and Miss Nares, and all\r\nthe people you see on your way home, that they had better attend to\r\ntheir own concerns than pretend to understand what would have been felt\r\nif your cousin had been drowned.  I wonder at their impertinence."\r\n\r\n"Are you in earnest, cousin Hester?  Shall we go and tell them so?"\r\n\r\n"No; she is not in earnest," said Margaret.  "But before you go, Morris\r\nshall give you some pieces for your quilt--some very pretty ones, such\r\nas she knows I can spare."\r\n\r\nMargaret rang, and Morris took the children up-stairs, to choose for\r\nthemselves out of Margaret\'s drawer of pieces.  When the door had closed\r\nbehind them, Margaret said--"Sister, do not make me wish that I had died\r\nunder the ice yesterday."\r\n\r\n"Margaret, how dare you say anything so wicked?"\r\n\r\n"If it be wicked, God forgive me!  I was wretched enough before--I would\r\nfain have never come to life again: and now you almost make me believe\r\nthat you would have been best pleased if I never had."\r\n\r\nAt this moment Hope entered.  He had left them in a far different mood:\r\nit made him breathless to see his wife\'s face of passion, and Margaret\'s\r\nof woe.\r\n\r\n"Hear her!" exclaimed Hester.  "She says I should have been glad to have\r\nlost her yesterday!"\r\n\r\n"Have mercy upon me!" cried Margaret, in excessive agitation.  "You\r\noppress me beyond what I can bear.  I cannot bear on as I used to do.\r\nMy strength is gone, and you give me none.  You take away what I had!"\r\n\r\n"Will you hear me spoken to in this way?" cried Hester, turning to her\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\n"I will."\r\n\r\nMargaret\'s emotion prevented her hearing this, or caring who was by.\r\nShe went on--"You leave me nothing--nothing but yourself--and you abuse\r\nmy love for you.  You warn me against love--against marriage--you chill\r\nmy very soul with terror at it.  I have found a friend in Maria; and you\r\npoison my comfort in my friendship, and insult my friend.  There is not\r\nan infant in a neighbour\'s house but you become jealous of it the moment\r\nI take it in my arms.  There is not a flower in your garden, not a book\r\non my table, that you will let me love in peace.  How ungenerous--while\r\nyou have one to cherish and who cherishes you, that you will have me\r\nlonely!--that you quarrel with all who show regard to me!--that you\r\nrefuse me the least solace, when my heart is breaking with its\r\nloneliness!  Oh, it is cruel!"\r\n\r\n"Will you hear this, Edward?"\r\n\r\n"I will, because it is the truth.  For once, Hester, you must hear\r\nanother\'s mind; you have often told your own."\r\n\r\n"God knows why I was saved yesterday," murmured Margaret; "for a more\r\ndesolate creature does not breathe."\r\n\r\nHope leaned against the wall.  Hester relieved her torment of mind with\r\nreproaches of Margaret.\r\n\r\n"You do not trust me," she cried; "it is you who make me miserable.  You\r\ngo to others for the comfort you ought to seek in me.  You place that\r\nconfidence in others which ought to be mine alone.  You are cheered when\r\nyou learn that the commonest gossips in Deerbrook care about you, and\r\nyou set no value on your own sister\'s feelings for you.  You have faith\r\nand charity for people out of doors, and mistrust and misconstruction\r\nfor those at home.  I am the injured one, Margaret, not you."\r\n\r\n"Margaret," said Hope, "your sister speaks for herself.  I think that\r\nyou are the injured one, as Hester herself will soon agree.  So far from\r\nhaving anything to reproach you with, I honour your forbearance,--\r\nunremitting till this hour,--I mourn that we cannot, if we would,\r\nconsole you in return.  But whatever I can do shall be done.  Your\r\nfriendships, your pursuits, shall be protected.  If we persecute your\r\naffections at home, I will take care that you are allowed their exercise\r\nabroad.  Rely upon me, and do not think yourself utterly lonely while\r\nyou have a brother."\r\n\r\n"I have been very selfish," said Margaret, recovering herself at the\r\nfirst word of kindness; "wretchedness makes me selfish, I think."\r\n\r\nShe raised herself up on the sofa, and timidly held out her hand to her\r\nsister.  Hester thrust it away.  Margaret uttered a cry of agony, such\r\nas had never been heard from her since her childhood.  Hope fell on the\r\nfloor--he had fainted at the sound.\r\n\r\nEven now there was no one but Morris who understood it.  Margaret\r\nreproached herself bitterly for her selfishness--for her loss of the\r\npower of self-control.  Hester\'s remorse, however greater in degree, was\r\nof its usual kind, strong and brief.  She repeated, as she had done\r\nbefore, that she made her husband wretched--that she should never have\r\nanother happy moment--that she wished he had never seen her.  For the\r\nrest of the day she was humbled, contrite, convinced that she should\r\ngive way to her temper no more.  Her eyes filled when her husband spoke\r\ntenderly to her, and her conduct to Margaret was one act of\r\nsupplication.  But a lesser degree of this same kind of penitence had\r\nproduced no permanent good effect before; and there was no security that\r\nthe present paroxysm would have a different result.\r\n\r\nMorris had seen that the children were engaged up-stairs when she came\r\ndown at Margaret\'s silent summons, to help to revive her master.  When\r\nshe saw that there had been distress before there was illness, she took\r\nher part.  She resolved that no one but herself should hear his first\r\nwords, and sent the ladies away when she saw that his consciousness was\r\nreturning.  All the world might have heard his first words.  He\r\nrecovered himself with a vigorous effort, swallowed a glass of wine, and\r\nwithin a few minutes was examining a patient in the waiting-room.  There\r\nthe little girls saw him as they passed the half-open door, on their way\r\nout with their treasure of chintz and print; and having heard some\r\nbustle below, they carried home word that they believed Mr Hope had\r\nbeen doing something to somebody which had made somebody faint; and\r\nSophia, shuddering, observed how horrid it must be to be a surgeon\'s\r\nwife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY FOUR.\r\n\r\nWARNINGS.\r\n\r\nMaria Young\'s lodging at the farrier\'s had one advantage over many\r\nbetter dwellings;--it was pleasanter in Winter than in Summer.  There\r\nwas little to find fault with in the tiny sitting-room after candles\r\nwere lighted.  The fire burned clear in the grate; and when the screen\r\nwas up, there were no draughts.  This screen was quite a modern\r\nimprovement.  When Fanny and Mary Grey had experienced the pleasure of\r\nsurprising Sophia with a token of sisterly affection, in the shape of a\r\npiece of India-rubber, and their mother with a token of filial\r\naffection, in the form of a cotton-box, they were unwilling to stop, and\r\nlooked round to see whether they could not present somebody with a token\r\nof some other sort of affection.  Sophia was taken into their counsels;\r\nand she, being aware of how Miss Young\'s candle flared when the wind was\r\nhigh, devised this screen.  The carpenter made the frame; Sydney covered\r\nit with canvas and black paper for a ground; and the little girls pasted\r\non it all the drawings and prints they could muster.  Here was the\r\nDargle, an everlasting waterfall, that looked always the same in the\r\nsunny-coloured print.  There was Morland\'s Woodcutter, with his tall\r\nfigure, his pipe, his dog, and his faggot, with the snow lying all\r\naround him.  Two or three cathedrals were interspersed; and, in the\r\nmidst of them, and larger than any of them, a silhouette of Mr Grey,\r\nwith the eyelash wonderfully like, and the wart upon his nose not to be\r\nmistaken.  Then there was Charles the First taking leave of his family;\r\nand, on either side of this, an evening primrose in water-colours, by\r\nMary, and a head of Terror, with a square mouth and starting eyes, in\r\ncrayon, by Fanny.  Mrs Grey produced some gay border which the\r\npaper-hanger had left over when the attics were last furnished; and\r\nSydney cut out in white paper a huntsman with his whip in the air, a\r\nfox, a gate, and two hounds.  Mr Grey pleaded, that, having contributed\r\nhis face, he had done all that could be expected of him: nevertheless,\r\nhe brought home one day, on his return from market, a beautiful Stream\r\nof Time, which made the children dance round their screen.  It was\r\nsettled at first that this would nobly ornament the whole of one side;\r\nbut it popped into Sydney\'s head, just as he was falling asleep one\r\nnight, how pretty it would be to stick it round with the planets.  So\r\nthe planets were cut out in white, and shaded with Indian ink.  There\r\nwas no mistaking Saturn with his ring, or Jupiter with his moons.  At\r\nlength, all was done, and the cook was glad to hear that no more paste\r\nwould be wanted, and the little girls might soon leave off giggling when\r\nMiss Young asked them, in the schoolroom, why they were jogging one\r\nanother\'s elbows.  Mr Grey spared one of his men to deposit the\r\nprecious piece of handiwork at Miss Young\'s lodging; and there, when she\r\nwent home one cold afternoon, she found the screen standing between the\r\nfire and the door, and, pinned on it, a piece of paper, inscribed, "A\r\nToken of friendly Affection."\r\n\r\nThis was not, however, the only, nor the first, gift with which Maria\'s\r\nparlour was enriched.  Amidst all the bustle of furnishing the Hopes\'\r\nhouse, Margaret had found time to plan and execute a window-curtain for\r\nher friend\'s benefit; and another person--no other than Philip Enderby--\r\nhad sent in a chaise-longue, just the right size to stand between the\r\nfire and the table.  It had gone hard with Maria to accept this last\r\ngift; but his nephew and nieces were Philip\'s plea of excuse for the\r\nact; and this plea cut her off from refusing: though in her heart she\r\nbelieved that neither the children nor ancient regard were in his\r\nthoughts when he did it, but rather Margaret\'s affection for her.  For\r\nsome time, this chaise-longue was a couch of thorns; but now affairs had\r\nput on a newer aspect still, and Maria forgot her own perplexities and\r\ntroubles in sympathy with her friend.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing to quarrel with in the look of the chaise-longue, when\r\nMargaret entered Maria\'s room in the twilight, in the afternoon of the\r\nappointed Thursday.\r\n\r\n"Reading by fire-light?" said Margaret.\r\n\r\n"I suppose I am: but it had not occurred to me--the daylight went away\r\nso softly.  Six o\'clock, I declare!  The days _are_ lengthening, as we\r\nsay every year.  But we will have something better than firelight, if\r\nyou will be so kind as to set those candles on the table."\r\n\r\nThe time was long put when Maria thought of apologising for asking her\r\nfriend to do what her lameness rendered painful to herself.  Margaret\r\nlaid aside her bonnet and cloak behind the screen, lighted the candles,\r\nput more coals on the fire, and took her seat--not beside Maria, but in\r\na goodly armchair, which she drew forward from its recess.\r\n\r\n"Now," said she, "we only want a cat to be purring on the rug to make us\r\na complete winter picture.  The kettle will be coming soon to sing on\r\nthe hob: and that will do nearly as well.  But, Maria, I wonder _you_\r\nhave no cat.  We have set up a cat.  I think I will send you a kitten,\r\nsome day, as a token of neighbourly affection."\r\n\r\n"Thank you.  Do you know, I was positively assured lately that I had a\r\ncat?  I said all I could in proof that I had none; but Mrs Tucker\r\npersisted in her inquiries after its health, notwithstanding."\r\n\r\n"What did she mean?"\r\n\r\n"She said she saw a kitten run into the passage, and that it never came\r\nout again: so that it followed of course that it must be here still.\r\nOne day, when I was in school, she came over to satisfy herself; and\r\ntrue enough, there had been a kitten.  The poor thing jumped from the\r\npassage window into the yard, and went to see what they were about at\r\nthe forge.  A hot horse-shoe fell upon its back, and it mewed so\r\ndolefully that the people drowned it.  So there you have the story of my\r\ncat, as it was told to me."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, it is a good thing to know.  But what does Mrs Grey say to\r\nyour setting up a cat?"\r\n\r\n"When she heard Mrs Tucker\'s first inquiries, she took them for an\r\nimputation, and was vexed accordingly.  `Miss Young!\' said she, `You\r\nmust be mistaken, Mrs Tucker.  Miss Young cannot afford to keep a\r\nkitten!\'"\r\n\r\n"Oh, for shame!" said Margaret, laughing.  "But what is the annual\r\nexpense of a kitten--can you tell us?  I am afraid we never considered\r\nthat."\r\n\r\n"Why, there is the breast of a fowl, once a year or so, when your cook\r\nforgets to shut the larder-door behind her.  Cats never take the\r\ndrumsticks when there is a breast, you are aware.  You know best how Mr\r\nHope looks, when the drumsticks and side bones come to table, with an\r\nempty space in the middle of the dish where the breast ought to have\r\nbeen."\r\n\r\n"I will tell you, the first time it happens."  And Margaret sank into an\r\nabsent fit, brought on by the bare suggestion of discontent at home.\r\nHester had made her uncomfortable, the last thing before she left the\r\nhouse, by speaking sharply of Maria, without any fresh provocation.\r\nUndisciplined still by what had happened so lately, she had wished Maria\r\nYoung a hundred miles off.  Margaret meditated and sighed.  It was some\r\ntime before Maria spoke.  When she did, she said:\r\n\r\n"Margaret, do not you think people had better not persuade themselves\r\nand their very intimate friends that they are happy when they are not?"\r\n\r\n"They had better not think, even in their own innermost minds, whether\r\nthey are happy or not, if they can help it."\r\n\r\n"True: but there are times when that is impossible--when it is far\r\nbetter to avoid the effort.  Come--I suspect we may relieve each other\r\njust now, by allowing the truth.  I will own, if you will, that I am\r\nvery unhappy to-night.  Never mind what it is about."\r\n\r\n"I will, if you will," replied Margaret, faintly smiling.\r\n\r\n"There now, that\'s right!  We shall be all the better for it.  We have\r\nquite enough of seeming happy, God knows, beyond these doors.  We can\r\ntalk there about kittens and cold fowl.  Here we will not talk at all,\r\nunless we like; and we will each groan as much as we please."\r\n\r\n"I am sorry to hear you speak so," said Margaret, tenderly.  "Not that I\r\ndo not agree with you.  I think it is a terrible mistake to fancy that\r\nit is religious to charm away grief, which, after all, is rejecting it\r\nbefore it has done its work; and, as for concealing it, there must be\r\nvery good reasons indeed for that, to save it from being hypocrisy.  But\r\nthe more I agree with you, the more sorry I am to hear you say just what\r\nI was thinking.  I am afraid you must be very unhappy, Maria."\r\n\r\n"I\'m in great pain to-night; and I do not find that pain becomes less of\r\nan evil by one\'s being used to it.  Indeed, I think the reverse happens;\r\nfor the future comes into the consideration."\r\n\r\n"Do you expect to go on to suffer this same pain?  Can nothing cure it?\r\nIs there no help?"\r\n\r\n"None, but in patience.  There are intermissions, happily, and pretty\r\nlong ones.  I get through the summer very well; but the end of the\r\nwinter--this same month of February--is a sad aching time; and so it\r\nmust be for as many winters as I may have to live.  But I am better off\r\nthan I was.  Last February I did not know you.  Oh, Margaret, if they\r\nhad not brought you up from under the ice, the other day, how different\r\nwould all have been to-night!"\r\n\r\n"How strange it seems to think of the difference that hung on that one\r\nact!" said Margaret, shivering again at the remembrance of her icy\r\nprison.  "What, and where, should I have been now?  And what would have\r\nbeen the change in this little world of ours?  You would have missed me,\r\nI know; and on that account I am glad it ended as it did."\r\n\r\n"And on no other?" asked Maria, looking earnestly at her friend.\r\n\r\n"My sister would have grieved sadly at first--you do not know what care\r\nshe takes of me--how often she is thinking of my comfort.  And Edward is\r\nfond of me too: I know he is; but they live for each other, and could\r\nspare every one else.  You and Morris would have been my mourners, and\r\nyou two are enough to live for."\r\n\r\n"To say nothing of others who may arise."\r\n\r\n"I hope nothing more will arise in my life, Maria.  I want no change.  I\r\nhave had enough of it."\r\n\r\n"You think so now.  I understand your feeling very well.  But yet I can\r\nfancy that when you are twice as old as you are--when a few grey hairs\r\npeep out among all that brown--when this plump little hand grows thin,\r\nand that girlish figure of yours looks dignified and middle-aged, and\r\npeople say that nobody thought when you were young that you would turn\r\nout a handsome woman--I can fancy that when all this has happened, you\r\nmay be more disposed to look forward, and less disinclined to change,\r\nthan you feel at this moment.  But there is no use in saying so now.\r\nYou shake your head, and I nod mine.  You say, `No,\' and I say, `Yes,\'\r\nand there is an end of it."\r\n\r\n"Where will you be then, I wonder?"\r\n\r\n"I do not wish to know, nor even to inquire of my own judgment.  My\r\nhealth is very bad--worse than you are aware of.  I cannot expect to be\r\nable to work always; some of my present pupils are growing very tall;\r\nand no strangers will take me if I do not get much better; which is, I\r\nbelieve, impossible.  The future, therefore, is all a mystery; and so\r\nlet it remain.  I am not anxious about that."\r\n\r\n"But I am."\r\n\r\n"Here comes tea.  Now you will be doing a finer thing in making us a\r\ngood cup of tea, than in settling my future ever so satisfactorily--\r\nseeing that you cannot touch it with so much as your little finger.  The\r\ntea is wholly in your power."\r\n\r\n"You look forward to other people\'s grey hair and sedateness of face,\r\nthough you will not to your own."\r\n\r\n"Mere grey hair is as certain as futurity itself; and I will allow you\r\nto prophesy that much for me or for anybody."\r\n\r\n"Why should we not prophesy about your pupils too?  They seem to be\r\nimproving very much."\r\n\r\n"They certainly are; and I am glad you have lighted upon the pleasantest\r\nsubject I ever think about.  Oh, Margaret, you do not know what\r\nencouragement I have about some of those children!  Their lot is and\r\nwill be a hard one, in many respects.  It will be difficult for them to\r\ngrow kindly, and liberal, and truthful, with such examples as they have\r\nbefore their eyes.  They advance like the snail on the wall, creeping\r\nthree inches on in the day, and falling back two at night.  They get out\r\nof a pretty mood of mind in the morning, and expand and grow interested\r\nin things out of Deerbrook; and then, in the evening, the greater part\r\nof this is undone, and they go to bed with their heads full of small,\r\nvile notions about their neighbours."\r\n\r\n"And when they grow too wise to have their heads so filled, their hearts\r\nwill be heavy for those who are not rising like themselves."\r\n\r\n"That is unavoidable, and they must bear the sorrow.  We must hope that\r\nthey will disperse from Deerbrook, and find their way into a more genial\r\nsociety than they can ever know here.  I must keep the confidence of my\r\nchildren sacred even from you, Margaret: but you may believe me when I\r\ntell you, that if you knew all that we have to say to one another, you\r\nwould find some of these children animated with really noble thoughts,\r\nand capable of really generous acts."\r\n\r\n"`Some of them.\'  Mary, in particular, I venture to conjecture to be in\r\nyour thoughts."\r\n\r\n"Yes: Mary in particular; but she had always a more gentle and generous\r\ntemper than her sisters.  Fanny, however, is improving remarkably."\r\n\r\n"I am delighted to hear it, and I had begun to suspect it.  Fanny, I\r\nobserve, lays fewer informations than she did; and there is more of\r\nthought, and less of a prying expression, in her face.  She is really\r\ngrowing more like Mary in countenance.  The little Rowlands--the younger\r\nones--seem simple enough; but Matilda, what a disagreeable child she\r\nis!"\r\n\r\n"The most that can be done with her is to leave her only a poor\r\ncreature--to strip her of the conceit and malice with which her mother\r\nwould overlay her feeble intellect.  This sounds deplorably enough; but,\r\nas parents will not speak the plain truth to themselves about their\r\ncharge, governesses must.  There is, perhaps, little better material in\r\nFanny: but I trust we may one day see her more lowly than she can at\r\npresent relish the idea of being, and with energy enough to improve\r\nunder the discipline of life, when she can no longer have that of\r\nschool.  She and Mary have been acknowledging to-day a fine piece of\r\nexperience.  Mr Grey is pleased with their great Improvement in Latin.\r\nHe finds they can read, with ease and pleasure, some favourite classical\r\nscraps which he used to talk about without exciting any interest in\r\nthem.  They honestly denied having devoted any more time to Latin than\r\nbefore, or having taken any more pains; and no new methods have been\r\ntried.  Here was a mystery.  To-day they have solved it.  They find that\r\nall is owing to their getting up earlier in the morning to teach those\r\nlittle orphans, the Woods, to read and sew."\r\n\r\n"Not a very circuitous process," said Margaret; "love and kind interest,\r\nenergy and improvement--whether in Latin or anything else.  But what did\r\nyou mean just now about truth?  What should make the Greys otherwise\r\nthan truthful?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, not the Greys!  I was thinking of the other family when I said\r\nthat.  But that is a large subject: let us leave it till after tea.\r\nWill you give me another cup?"\r\n\r\n"Now; shall we begin upon our large subject?" said she, as the door\r\nclosed behind the tea-tray and kettle, and Margaret handed her her\r\nwork-bag.\r\n\r\n"I am aware that I asked for it," replied Margaret; "but it is a\r\ndisagreeable topic, and perhaps we had better avoid it."\r\n\r\n"You will take me for a Deerbrook person, if I say we will go into it,\r\nwill not you?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no: you have a reason, I see.  So, why should not the little\r\nRowlands be truthful?"\r\n\r\n"Because they have so perpetual an example of falsehood before them at\r\nhome.  I have made some painful discoveries there lately."\r\n\r\n"Is it possible you did not know that woman long ago?"\r\n\r\n"I knew her obvious qualities, which there is no need to specify: but\r\nthe depth of her untruth is a new fact to me."\r\n\r\n"Are you sure of it, now?"\r\n\r\n"Quite sure of it in some particulars, and strongly suspecting it in\r\nothers.  Do not tell your sister anything of what I am going to say,\r\nunless you find it necessary for the direction of her conduct.  Let your\r\ndisclosures be rather to Mr Hope.  That is settled, is it?  Well, Mrs\r\nRowland\'s ruling passion just now is hatred to your household."\r\n\r\n"I suspected as much.  But--the untruth."\r\n\r\n"Wait a little.  She dislikes you, all and severally."\r\n\r\n"What, my brother?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes; for marrying into the Grey connection so decidedly.  Did you\r\never hear that before?"\r\n\r\nMargaret laughed; and her friend went on--\r\n\r\n"This capture and imprisonment of her mother (for the poor old lady is\r\nnot allowed to see whom she pleases) is chiefly to get her from under\r\nMr Hope\'s care.  I fancy, from her air, and from some things she has\r\ndropped, that she has some grand _coup-de-theatre_ in reserve about that\r\nmatter; but this is merely suspicion: I will now speak only of what I\r\nknow to exist.  She is injuring your brother to an extent that he is\r\nnot, but ought to be, aware of."\r\n\r\n"What does she say?  She shudders at his politics, I know."\r\n\r\n"Yes; that might be ignorance merely, and even conscientious ignorance:\r\nso we will let that pass.  She also hints, very plainly and extensively,\r\nthat your brother and sister are not happy together."\r\n\r\n"She is a wicked woman," said Margaret, with a deep sigh.  "I half\r\nsuspected what you tell me, from poor George\'s errand that unhappy day."\r\n\r\n"Right.  Mr Rowland\'s irony was intended to stop his wife\'s\r\ninsinuations before the children.  She says the most unwarrantable\r\nthings about Mrs Grey\'s having made the match--and she intimates that\r\nHester has several times gone to bed in hysterics, from Mr Hope having\r\nupbraided her with taking him in."\r\n\r\n"What _is_ to be done?" cried Margaret, throwing down her work.\r\n\r\n"Your brother will decide for himself whether to speak to Mr Rowland,\r\nor to let the slander pass, and live it down.  Our duty is to give him\r\ninformation; and I feel that it is a duty.  And now, have you been told\r\nanything about Mr Hope\'s practice of dissection?"\r\n\r\nMargaret related what she had heard on the bank of the river, and Hope\'s\r\nexplanation of it.\r\n\r\n"He knows more than he told you, I have no doubt," replied Maria.  "The\r\nbeginning of it was, your brother\'s surgery-pupil having sent a great\r\ntoe, in a handsome-looking sealed packet, to some lad in the village,\r\nwho happened to open it at table.  You may imagine the conjectures as to\r\nwhere it came from, and the revival of stories about robbing\r\nchurchyards, and of prejudices about dissection.  Mrs Rowland could not\r\nlet such an opportunity as this pass by; and her neighbours have been\r\nfavoured with dark hints, as to what has been heard under the churchyard\r\nwall, and what she herself has seen from her window in sleepless nights.\r\nNow, Mr Hope must take notice of this.  It is too dangerous a subject\r\nto be left quietly to the ignorance and superstitions of such a set of\r\npeople as those among whom his calling lies.  No ignorance on earth\r\nexceeds that of the country folks whom he attends."\r\n\r\n"But they worship him," cried Margaret.\r\n\r\n"They have worshipped him; but you know, worship easily gives place to\r\nhatred among the extremely ignorant; and nothing is so likely to quicken\r\nthe process as to talk about violating graves.  Do not be frightened; I\r\ntell you this to prevent mischief, not to prophesy it.  Mr Hope will\r\ntake what measures he thinks fit: and I shall tell Mr Rowland, tomorrow\r\nmorning, that I am the source of your information.  I was just going to\r\nwarn him to-day that I meant to speak to you in this way; but I left it\r\ntill to-morrow, that I might not be prevented."\r\n\r\n"Dear Maria, this will cost you your bread."\r\n\r\n"I believe not; but this consideration belongs to that future of time on\r\nwhich, as I was saying, we cannot lay our little fingers.  The present\r\nis clear enough--that Mr Hope ought to know his own case."\r\n\r\n"He shall know it.  But, Maria, do you mean that Mrs Rowland talks of\r\nall these affairs before her children?"\r\n\r\n"When Mr Rowland is not present to check it.  And this brings me to\r\nsomething which I think ought to be said, though I have no proof to\r\nbring.  Having found of late what things Mrs Rowland can say for a\r\npurpose--how variously and how monstrously untrue--and seeing that all\r\nher enterprises are at present directed against the people who live in a\r\npleasant little corner-house--"\r\n\r\n"But why?  You have not yet fully accounted for this enmity."\r\n\r\n"I have not, but I will now.  I think she joins your name with her\r\nbrother\'s, and that she accordingly hates you now as she once hated\r\nHester.  But mind, I am not sure of this."\r\n\r\n"But how--?  Why--?"\r\n\r\n"You will divine that I have changed my opinion about Mr Enderby\'s\r\nbeing engaged to Miss Bruce, since you asked me for my judgment upon it.\r\nI may very possibly be mistaken: but as Mr Enderby lies under censure\r\nfor forming and carrying on such an arrangement in strange concealment\r\nfrom his most intimate friends, I think it due to him at least to put\r\nthe supposition that he may not be guilty."\r\n\r\nMargaret could not speak, though a thousand questions struggled in her\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n"I am aware," continued Maria, "with what confidence she has everywhere\r\nstated the fact of this engagement, and that Mrs Enderby fully believes\r\nit.  But I have been struck throughout with a failure of particularity\r\nin Mrs Rowland\'s knowledge.  She cannot tell when her brother last saw\r\nMiss Bruce, nor whether he has any intention of going to Rome.  She does\r\nnot know, evidently, whether he was engaged when he was last here; and I\r\ncannot get rid of the impression, that his being engaged now is a matter\r\nof inference from a small set of facts, which will bear more than one\r\ninterpretation."\r\n\r\n"Surely she would not dare--."  Margaret paused.\r\n\r\n"It is a bold stroke (supposing me right), but she would strike boldly\r\nto make a quarrel between her brother and his friends in the\r\ncorner-house: and if the device should fail at last, she has the\r\nintermediate satisfaction of making them uncomfortable."\r\n\r\n"Horrid creature!" said Margaret, feeling, however, that she would\r\nforgive all the horridness for the sake of finding that Mrs Rowland had\r\ndone this horrid thing.\r\n\r\n"We must not forget," said Maria, "that there is another side to the\r\nquestion.  Young men have been known to engage themselves mysteriously,\r\nand without sufficient respect to the confidence of intimate friends."\r\n\r\n"This must be ascertained, Maria;" and again Margaret stopped short with\r\na blush of shame.\r\n\r\n"By time, Margaret; in no other way.  I cannot, of course, speak to Mr\r\nRowland, or any one, on so private an affair of the family; nor, under\r\nthe circumstances, can Mr Hope stir in it.  We must wait; but it cannot\r\nbe for long.  Some illumination must reach Deerbrook soon--either from\r\nMr Enderby\'s going to Rome, or coming here to see his mother."\r\n\r\n"Mrs Rowland said he would come here, she hoped, for his wedding\r\njourney."\r\n\r\n"She did say so, I know.  And she has told plenty of people that her\r\nbrother is delighted that Mrs Enderby is settled with her; whereas some\r\nbeautiful plants arrived this morning for Mrs Enderby\'s conservatory,\r\nby his orders (the Rowlands have no conservatory you know).  The\r\nchildren were desired not to mention the arrival of these plants to\r\ngrandmamma; and Mrs Rowland wrote by return of post--I imagine to\r\ninform him for the first time of his mother\'s removal."\r\n\r\nMargaret thought these things were too bad to be true.\r\n\r\n"I should have said so, too, some time ago: and as I cannot too\r\nearnestly repeat, I may be wrong now.  But I have done my duty in giving\r\nyou reason for suspending your judgment of Mr Enderby.  This being\r\ndone, we will talk of something else.--Now, do not you think there may\r\nbe some difficulty in preserving my pupils from a habit of untruth?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed."\r\n\r\nBut the talking of something else did not operate so well as it sounded.\r\nThe pauses were long after what had passed.  At length, when Margaret\r\ndetected herself in the midst of the speculation, "if he is not engaged\r\nto Miss Bruce, it does not follow--," she roused herself, and\r\nexclaimed--\r\n\r\n"How very good it is of you, Maria, to have laid all this open to me!"\r\n\r\nMaria hung her head over her work, and thought within herself that her\r\nfriend could not judge of the deed.  She replied--\r\n\r\n"Thank you!  I thought I should get some sympathy from you in the end,\r\nto repay me for the irksomeness of exposing such a piece of social vice\r\nas this poor lady\'s conduct."\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed, I ought to have acknowledged it before, as I feel it; but\r\nyou know there is so much to think over! it is so wonderful--so almost\r\ninconceivable!"\r\n\r\n"It is so."\r\n\r\n"Is it quite necessary, Maria--yes, I see it is necessary that you\r\nshould speak to Mr Rowland to-morrow?  You are bound in honesty to do\r\nso; but it will be very painful.  Can we not help you?  Can we not in\r\nsome way spare you?"\r\n\r\n"No, you cannot, thank you.  For Mr Rowland\'s sake, no one must be by;\r\nand none of you can testify to the facts.  No; leave me alone.  By this\r\ntime to-morrow night it will be done.  What knock is that?  No one ever\r\nknocks on my account.  Surely it cannot be your servant already.  It is\r\nonly now half-past eight."\r\n\r\n"I promised Hester I would go home early."\r\n\r\n"She cannot want you half so much as I do.  Stay another hour."\r\n\r\nMargaret could not.  Hester made a point of her returning at this time.\r\nWhen the cloaking and final chat were done, and Margaret was at the\r\ndoor, Maria called her.  Margaret came skipping back to hear her\r\nfriend\'s whisper.\r\n\r\n"How is your wretchedness, Margaret?"\r\n\r\n"How is yours?" was Margaret\'s reply.\r\n\r\n"Much better.  The disburdening of it is a great comfort."\r\n\r\n"And the pain--the aching?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, never mind that!"\r\n\r\nMargaret shook her head; she could not but mind it--but wish that she\r\ncould take it upon herself sometimes.  She had often thought lately,\r\nthat she should rather enjoy a few weeks of Maria\'s pain, as an\r\nalternative to the woe under which she had been suffering; but this, if\r\nshe could have tried the experiment, she would probably have found to be\r\na mistake.  When she saw her friend cover her eyes with her hand, as if\r\nfor a listless hour of solitude, she felt that she had been wrong in\r\nyielding to her sister\'s jealousy of her being so much with Maria; and\r\nshe resolved that, next time, Maria should appoint the hour for her\r\nreturn home.\r\n\r\nWhen Maria was thus covering her eyes with her hand, she was\r\nthinking--"Now, half this task is over.  The other half to-morrow--and\r\nthen the consequences!"\r\n\r\nWhen Margaret entered the drawing-room at home, where her brother was\r\nreading aloud to Hester, he exclaimed--\r\n\r\n"We beat all Deerbrook for early visiting, I think.  Here are you home;\r\nand I dare say Mr Tucker has still another pipe to smoke, and the wine\r\nis not mulled yet at the Jameses."\r\n\r\n"It is quite time Margaret was giving us a little of her company, I am\r\nsure," said Hester.  "You forget how early she went.  If it was not for\r\nthe school, I think she and Maria would spend all their time together.\r\nI have every wish not to interfere: but I cannot think that this\r\nfriendship has made Maria less selfish."\r\n\r\n"It would, I dare say, my dear, but that there was no selfishness to\r\nbegin upon.  I am afraid she is very unwell, Margaret?"\r\n\r\n"In much pain, I fear."\r\n\r\n"I will go and see if I can do her any good.  You can glance over what\r\nwe have read, and I shall be back in a quarter of an hour, to go on with\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"I wonder you left Maria, if she is so poorly."\r\n\r\n"I determined that I would not, another time; but this time I had\r\npromised."\r\n\r\n"Pray, do not make out that I am any restraint upon your intercourse\r\nwith Maria.  And yet--it is not quite fair to say that, either."\r\n\r\n"I do not think it is quite fair."\r\n\r\n"But you should warn me--you should tell me, if I ask anything\r\nunreasonable.  When are you going again?  An old patient of my husband\'s\r\nhas sent us a quarter of a chest of very fine oranges.  We will carry\r\nMaria a basketful of oranges to-morrow."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY FIVE.\r\n\r\nLONG WALKS.\r\n\r\nThe unhappy are indisposed to employment: all active occupations are\r\nwearisome and disgusting in prospect, at a time when everything, life\r\nitself, is full of weariness and disgust.  Yet the unhappy must be\r\nemployed, or they will go mad.  Comparatively blessed are they, if they\r\nare set in families, where claims and duties abound, and cannot be\r\nescaped.  In the pressure of business there is present safety and\r\nultimate relief.  Harder is the lot of those who have few necessary\r\noccupations, enforced by other claims than their own harmlessness and\r\nprofitableness.  Reading often fails.  Now and then it may beguile; but\r\nmuch oftener the attention is languid, the thoughts wander, and\r\nassociations with the subject of grief are awakened.  Women who find\r\nthat reading will not do, will obtain no relief from sewing.  Sewing is\r\npleasant enough in moderation to those whose minds are at ease the\r\nwhile; but it is an employment which is trying to the nerves when long\r\ncontinued, at the best; and nothing can be worse for the harassed, and\r\nfor those who want to escape from themselves.  Writing is bad.  The pen\r\nhangs idly suspended over the paper, or the sad thoughts that are alive\r\nwithin write themselves down.  The safest and best of all occupations\r\nfor such sufferers as are fit for it, is intercourse with young\r\nchildren.  An infant might beguile Satan and his peers the day after\r\nthey were couched on the lake of fire, if the love of children chanced\r\nto linger amidst the ruins of their angelic nature.  Next to this comes\r\nhonest, genuine acquaintanceship among the poor; not mere\r\ncharity-visiting, grounded on soup-tickets and blankets, but intercourse\r\nof mind, with real mutual interest between the parties.  Gardening is\r\nexcellent, because it unites bodily exertion with a sufficient\r\nengagement of the faculties, while sweet, compassionate Nature is\r\nministering cure in every sprouting leaf and scented blossom, and\r\nbeckoning sleep to draw nigh, and be ready to follow up her benignant\r\nwork.  Walking is good,--not stepping from shop to shop, or from\r\nneighbour to neighbour; but stretching out far into the country, to the\r\nfreshest fields, and the highest ridges, and the quietest lanes.\r\nHowever sullen the imagination may have been among its griefs at home,\r\nhere it cheers up and smiles.  However listless the limbs may have been\r\nwhen sustaining a too heavy heart, here they are braced, and the lagging\r\ngait becomes buoyant again.  However perverse the memory may have been\r\nin presenting all that was agonising, and insisting only on what cannot\r\nbe retrieved, here it is first disregarded, and then it sleeps and the\r\nsleep of the memory is the day in Paradise to the unhappy.  The mere\r\nbreathing of the cool wind on the face in the commonest highway, is rest\r\nand comfort which must be felt at such times to be believed.  It is\r\ndisbelieved in the shortest intervals between its seasons of enjoyment:\r\nand every time the sufferer has resolution to go forth to meet it, it\r\npenetrates to the very heart in glad surprise.  The fields are better\r\nstill; for there is the lark to fill up the hours with mirthful music;\r\nor, at worst, the robin and flocks of fieldfares, to show that the\r\nhardest day has its life and hilarity.  But the calmest region is the\r\nupland, where human life is spread out beneath the bodily eye, where the\r\nmind roves from the peasant\'s nest to the spiry town, from the\r\nschool-house to the churchyard, from the diminished team in the patch of\r\nfallow, or the fisherman\'s boat in the cove, to the viaduct that spans\r\nthe valley, or the fleet that glides ghost-like on the horizon.  This is\r\nthe perch where the spirit plumes its ruffled and drooping wines, and\r\nmakes ready to let itself down any wind that Heaven may send.\r\n\r\nNo doubt Margaret found the benefit of exercise, and the solitary\r\nenjoyment of the country; for, during the last few weeks, walking seemed\r\nto have become a passion with her.  Hester was almost out of patience\r\nabout it, when for a moment she lost sight of what she well knew must be\r\nthe cause of this strong new interest.  Every doubtful morning, Margaret\r\nwas at the window exploring the clouds.  Every fine day she laid her\r\nwatch on the table before her, impatiently waiting the approach of the\r\nhour when her brother was to come in for Hester, and when she might set\r\noff by herself, not to return till dinner-time.  She became renowned in\r\nDeerbrook for the length of her excursions.  The grocer had met her far\r\nout in one direction, when returning from making his purchases at the\r\nmarket town.  The butcher had seen her in the distant fields, when he\r\npaid a visit to his grazier in the pastures.  Dr Levitt had walked his\r\nhorse beside her in the lane which formed the limit of the longer of his\r\ntwo common rides; and many a neighbour or patient of Mr Hope\'s had been\r\nsurprised at her declining a cast in a taxed-cart or gig, when there was\r\nonly a long stretch of plain road before her, and the lanes and fields\r\nwere too miry to enable her to seek any variety in them, in her way\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nThese were, in fact, Margaret\'s times of refreshing--of practical\r\nworship.  These were the times when she saw what at other moments she\r\nonly repeated to herself--that all things are right, and that our\r\npersonal trials derive their bitterness from our ignorance and spiritual\r\ninexperience.  At these times she could not only pity all who suffered,\r\nbut congratulate all who enjoyed, and could afford feelings of\r\ndisinterested regard to Philip, and of complacency to Miss Bruce.  She\r\nremembered that Miss Bruce was unconscious of having injured her--was\r\npossibly unaware even of her existence; and then she enjoyed the luxury\r\nof blessing her rival, and of longing for an opportunity to serve her\r\nsecretly and silently, as the happy girl\'s innocence of all wrong\r\ntowards her deserved.\r\n\r\nMargaret\'s desire for a long solitary walk was as strong as ever, the\r\nday after she had visited Maria.  No opportunity had occurred of\r\nspeaking to her brother without alarming Hester; and she had almost\r\ndetermined merely to refer him to Maria, instead of telling the story\r\nherself.  She should not see him again till dinner.  He was gone into\r\nthe country: the day was gloomy and cold, and Hester was not disposed to\r\nleave the fireside: so Margaret issued forth, with thick shoes,\r\numbrella, and muff--guarded against everything that might occur overhead\r\nand under foot.  She had generally found hope, or at least comfort,\r\nabroad; to-day, when she ought to have been much happier, she found\r\nanxiety and fear.  The thought, the very words, would incessantly recur,\r\n`If he is not engaged to Miss Bruce, it does not follow...\'  Then she\r\nseriously grieved for her brother, and the troubles which she feared\r\nawaited him; and then she reproached herself with not grieving enough--\r\nnot having attention enough to spare from her own concerns.  While she\r\nwas walking along on the dry causeway, looking straight before her, but\r\nthinking of far other things than the high-road, she was startled by the\r\nstroke of a horse\'s foot against a stone close by her side, and a voice\r\nspeaking almost in her ear.  It was only Edward.  He was going a couple\r\nof miles forward, and he brought his horse beside the raised causeway,\r\nso that they could converse as if walking together.\r\n\r\n"There is nobody to overhear us, I think," said Margaret, looking round.\r\n"I have been wanting, since yesterday evening, to speak to you alone--\r\nabout something very disagreeable, which I would not disturb Hester\r\nwith.  You, of course, can do as you please about telling her."\r\n\r\nShe related to him the whole story of Mrs Rowland\'s imputations and\r\nproceedings--her reports of the hysterics and their origin, the\r\nbody-snatching, and the cause and mode of Mrs Enderby\'s removal.\r\nMargaret had always considered her brother as a man of uncommon nerve;\r\nand her surprise was therefore great at seeing him change colour as he\r\ndid.\r\n\r\n"We shall agree," said she, "that the worst of all this is, that there\r\nis some truth at the bottom part of it."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Heavens!" thought Hope, "is it possible that Mrs Grey can have\r\ntold the share she had in my marriage?"  It was but a momentary fear.\r\nMargaret went on.\r\n\r\n"I have never hoped--I never hoped at Birmingham, and much less here--\r\nthat Hester could escape the observation of her neighbours--that her\r\noccasional agitation of spirits should not excite remark and\r\nspeculation.  As we are not quite whole and sound in our domestic\r\npeace--(I must speak plainly, brother, at such a time as this) I should\r\nthink it would be better to take no notice of that set of imputations.\r\nI trust we shall live them down."\r\n\r\n"You gave me great comfort in a few words once," said Hope.  "Do you\r\nremember saying, `When the time for acting comes, see how she will act!\'\r\nYou know her well, and you judge her rightly: and you will, perhaps, be\r\nthe less sorry to hear that the time seems coming when we may all have\r\nto act--I scarcely see how--but against adversity."\r\n\r\n"She will come out nobly then.  I fear nothing for her but too much\r\nprosperity."\r\n\r\n"There is no fear of that, I assure you," said Hope, smiling somewhat\r\nsadly.\r\n\r\n"You find the effect of this woman\'s slanders?"\r\n\r\n"My situation has, from one cause or more, totally changed since you\r\nfirst knew me.  It would break Hester\'s heart to hear what I am\r\nsubjected to in the discharge of my daily business.  I tell her a trifle\r\nnow and then, to prepare her for what may happen; but she and you do not\r\nknow a tenth part, of what is inflicted upon me."\r\n\r\n"And what may happen?"\r\n\r\n"I cannot see the extent of it myself: but I am losing my practice every\r\nday.  No; not through any failure; not through any of the accidents\r\nwhich will happen in all medical practice.  There are reports of such\r\nabroad, I believe; but nothing is commoner than those reports.  The\r\ntruth is, no patient of mine has died, or failed to do well, for an\r\nunusually long space of time.  The discontent with me is from other\r\ncauses."\r\n\r\n"From Mrs Rowland\'s tongue, I doubt not, more than from your politics."\r\n\r\n"The ignorance of the people about us is the great evil.  Without this,\r\nneither Mrs Rowland, nor any one else, could persuade them that I rob\r\nthe churchyard, and vaccinate children to get patients, and draw good\r\nteeth to sell again."\r\n\r\n"Oh, monstrous!" said Margaret, who yet could not help laughing.  "You\r\nnever draw teeth, do you?"\r\n\r\n"Sometimes; but not when I can get people to go to the dentist at\r\nBlickley.  Mrs Grey used to boast to you of my popularity; but I never\r\nliked it much.  I had to be perpetually on the watch to avoid\r\nconfidences; and you see how fast the stream is at present running the\r\ncontrary way.  I can hardly get on my horse now, without being insulted\r\nat my own door."\r\n\r\n"Must you submit to all this?"\r\n\r\n"By no means.  I have called two or three men to account, and shaken my\r\nwhip over one or two more--with excellent effect.  If there were none\r\nbut bullies among my enemies, I could easily deal with them."\r\n\r\n"But cannot we go away, and settle somewhere else?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no!  Wherever I might go, it would soon be understood that I had\r\nbeen obliged to leave Deerbrook, from being detected in body-snatching\r\nand the like.  I owe it to myself to stay.  We must remain, and live\r\ndown all imputations whatever, if we can."\r\n\r\n"And if we cannot?"\r\n\r\n"Then we shall see what to do when the time comes."\r\n\r\n"And having managed the bullies, how do you propose to manage Mrs\r\nRowland?  What do you think of speaking to Mr Grey?"\r\n\r\n"I shall not do that.  The Greys have no concern with it; but they will\r\nthink they have.  Then there will be a partisan warfare, with me for the\r\npretext, and the two families have had quite warfare enough for a\r\nlifetime already.  No, I shall not bring the Greys into it.  I am sorry\r\nenough for Mr Rowland, for I am sure he has no part in all this.  I\r\nshall go to him to-day.  I should confront the lady at once, and call\r\nher to account, but that Miss Young must be considered.  The more\r\ncourageous and disinterested she is, the more care we must take of her."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps she is at this moment telling Mr Rowland what we talked about\r\nlast night.  How very painful!  Do you know she thinks--(it is right to\r\ntell the whole for other people\'s sake)--she thinks that what Mrs\r\nRowland says is not to be trusted, in any case where she feels enmity.\r\nMaria even doubts whether Mr Enderby has treated you and his other\r\nfriends so very negligently--whether he is engaged to Miss Bruce, after\r\nall."\r\n\r\nMr Hope was so much engaged about one of his stirrups while Margaret\r\nsaid this, that he could not observe where and how she was looking.\r\n\r\n"Very likely," replied Hope, at length.  "Hester has thought all along\r\nthat this was possible.  We shall know the truth from Enderby himself,\r\none of these days, by act or word.  Meantime, I, for one, shall wait to\r\nhear his own story."\r\n\r\nThere was another pause, at the end of which Mr Hope clapped spurs to\r\nhis horse, and said he must be riding on.  Margaret called him back for\r\na moment, to ask what he wished her to do about informing Hester of the\r\nstate of affairs.  Mr Hope was disposed to tell her the whole, if\r\npossible; but not till he should have come to some issue with Mr\r\nRowland.  He hated mysteries--any concealments in families; and it was\r\ndue both to Hester and to himself that there should be no concealment of\r\nimportant affairs from her.  The only cautions to be observed were, to\r\nsave her from suspense, to avoid the appearance of a formal telling of\r\nbad news, and to choose an opportunity when she might have time, before\r\nseeing any of the Rowlands, to consider the principles which should\r\nregulate her conduct to them, that she might do herself honour by the\r\nconsistency and temper, of which she was capable under any\r\ncircumstances, when she was only allowed time.\r\n\r\nThis was settled, and he rode off with almost his usual gaiety of air.\r\n\r\nHe saw Mr Rowland before night.  The next day but one, a\r\ntravelling-carriage from Blickley was seen standing at Mr Rowland\'s\r\ndoor; and before the clock struck nine, it was loaded with trunks and\r\nband-boxes, and crowded with people.  As it drove down the village\r\nstreet, merry little faces appeared at each carriage window.  Mr\r\nRowland was on the box.  He was going to take his family to Cheltenham\r\nfor the spring months.  Miss Rowland was rather delicate, and Deerbrook\r\nwas cold in March.  Mrs Enderby was left behind; but there was Phoebe\r\nto take care of her; and Mr Rowland was to return as soon as he had\r\nsettled his family.  It seemed rather a pity, to be sure, that the old\r\nlady had been moved out of her own house just before she was to be left\r\nalone in her new residence; but, between Mr Rowland and her maid, she\r\nwould be taken good care of; and the family would return when the warm\r\nweather set in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY SIX.\r\n\r\nDISCLOSURES.\r\n\r\nThe whole village seemed relieved by the departure of the Rowlands.\r\nMrs Grey, who had always been refused admission to her old friend on\r\none pretence or another, was joyfully welcomed by Phoebe, and was\r\nplunged into all the delights of neighbourly chat before the clock\r\nstruck twelve, on the very first morning, Fanny and Mary Grey\r\nvoluntarily offered to go to Miss Young, now that they were her only\r\npupils, to save her the trouble of the walk to the schoolroom.  This was\r\na great relief to Maria, and her little parlour held the three very\r\nnicely; and when the girls had sufficiently admired the screen over\r\nagain,--their father\'s profile, the planets, and the Dargle, they\r\nsettled quite as well as at home.  There was still a corner left for\r\ncousin Margaret, when she chose to come with her German books, or her\r\nwork, and her useful remarks on what they were doing.  No immediate\r\nconsequences had happened to Maria from her plain-dealing with Mr\r\nRowland; and she was quite ready to enjoy the three months of freedom,\r\nwithout looking too anxiously towards the end of them.  The very\r\ngardener at the Rowlands\' seemed to bestir himself with unusual alacrity\r\nto put the garden into spring trim; and the cook and housemaid might be\r\nseen over the hedge, walking arm-in-arm on the gravel-walks, smelling at\r\nthe mezereon, and admiring Miss Anna\'s border of yellow crocuses, as the\r\ngardener said, as much as if they had been fine plants out of a\r\nconservatory.  The birds themselves seemed to begin their twittering in\r\nthe trees, and the cows their lowing in the meadow, from the hour that\r\nMrs Rowland went away.  In other words, there were many whom that event\r\nleft free and at ease to observe the harmonies of nature, who were\r\nusually compelled to observe only the lady, and the discords of her\r\nhousehold.\r\n\r\nIt was only the second day after the departure of the family that\r\nMargaret took her seat in the offered corner of Maria\'s parlour.  She\r\nlaid down her book, and took up her work, when the question arose, which\r\nhas probably interested all intelligent school-girls for many a year--\r\nWhat made so many Athenians,--so many, that there must have been some\r\nwise and good men among them,--treat such a person as Socrates in the\r\nway they did?  Margaret was quite occupied in admiring the sort of\r\nSocratic method, with which Maria drew out from the minds of her pupils\r\nsome of the difficult philosophy of Opinion, and the liberality with\r\nwhich she allowed for the distress of heathen moralists at having the\r\nsanction of Custom broken up.  Margaret was thus quite occupied with the\r\ndelight of seeing a great subject skilfully let down into young minds,\r\nand the others were no less busy with the subject itself, when Mary\r\nstarted, and said it made her jump to see Sydney bring Fairy close up to\r\nthe window.  Fanny imperiously bade her mind what she was about, and let\r\nSydney alone: but yet, in a minute or two, Fanny\'s own eyes were\r\ndetected wandering into the yard where Sydney still remained.  "He is\r\ngetting Fairy shod," she said in a soliloquising tone.  Every one\r\nlaughed,--the idea of shoeing a fairy was so ridiculous!--and some\r\nwitticisms, about Bottom the Weaver, and his ass\'s head, were sported.\r\nIt was evident that Socrates had no more chance this day, and Maria\r\nchanged the subject.\r\n\r\n"Sydney looks very much as if he wanted to come in," observed Mary.\r\n\r\nSydney did particularly wish to come in; but he saw that cousin Margaret\r\nwas there: and he had felt an unconquerable awe of cousin Margaret ever\r\nsince the day of his conveying her over the ice.  So he stood\r\nirresolutely watching, as nail after nail was driven into Fairy\'s hoof,\r\ncasting glances every minute at the window.\r\n\r\n"Shall I see what he wants?" asked Margaret, perceiving that lessons\r\nwould not go on till Sydney had got out what he wished to say.  "May I\r\nopen the window for a moment, Maria, to speak to him?"\r\n\r\n"What do you think?" cried Sydney, taking instant advantage of the\r\nmovement, and carrying off his awkwardness by whipping the window-sill\r\nwhile he spoke.  "What _do_ you think?  Mr Enderby is come by the coach\r\nthis morning.  I saw him myself; and you might have met our Ben carrying\r\nhis portmanteau home, from where he was put down, half an hour ago.\r\nWe\'ll have rare sport, if he stays as long as he did last summer.  I do\r\nbelieve," he continued, leaning into the room, and speaking with a touch\r\nof his mother\'s mystery, "he would have come long since if Mrs Rowland\r\nhad not been here.  I wish she had taken herself off two months ago, and\r\nthen I might have had a run with the harriers with him, as he promised I\r\nshould."\r\n\r\n"Now you have said just a little too much, Sydney; so you may go," said\r\nMaria.  "Shut down the window, will you?"\r\n\r\nIt was well for Margaret that there was the recess of the window to lean\r\nin.  There she stood, not speaking a word.  It was not in nature for\r\nMaria to refrain from casting a glance at her,--which glance grew into a\r\nlook of intelligence.\r\n\r\n"You do not quite wink as mamma does," observed Fanny, "but I know very\r\nwell what you mean, Miss Young."\r\n\r\n"So people always fancy when they observe upon nothing, or upon what\r\nthey know nothing about, Fanny.  But I thought you were convinced, some\r\ntime ago, that you should not watch people\'s countenances, to find out\r\nwhat they are thinking, any more than--"\r\n\r\n"I should read a letter they are writing," interrupted Fanny.  "Well, I\r\nbeg your pardon, Miss Young; but I really thought I saw you looking at\r\ncousin Margaret\'s face.  However, I dare say everybody supposes the\r\nsame,--that Mr Enderby would not have been here now if Mrs Rowland had\r\nnot gone away.  You need not mind Mary and me, Miss Young; you know we\r\nhear all about Mrs Rowland at home."\r\n\r\n"I know you are apt to fancy that you understand all about Mrs Rowland,\r\nmy dear; but perhaps Mrs Rowland herself might happen to differ from\r\nyou, if she could look into your mind.  It is for you to settle with\r\nyourself, whether you think she would be satisfied that you have done by\r\nher as you would have her do by you.  This is your own affair, Fanny; so\r\nnow, without any one trying to see in your face what you think of\r\nyourself, we will go to our business."\r\n\r\nThe scratching of pens in the exercise-books, and the turning over of\r\nthe dictionary, now proceeded for some time in profound silence, in the\r\nmidst of which Margaret stole back to her corner.\r\n\r\n"There goes twelve!" softly exclaimed Mary.  "Mamma said we might go\r\nwith her to call at cousin Hester\'s, if we were home and ready by\r\nhalf-past twelve.  We shall not have nearly done, Miss Young."\r\n\r\nMiss Young did not take the hint.  She only said--\r\n\r\n"Is your mamma going to call on Mrs Hope?  Then, Margaret, do not let\r\nus detain you here.  You will wish to be at home, I am sure."\r\n\r\nNever, as Maria supposed, had Margaret more impatiently desired to be at\r\nhome.  Though accustomed to go in and out of Maria\'s abode, with or\r\nwithout reason assigned, she had not now ventured to move, though the\r\nlittle room felt like a prison.  An awkward consciousness had fixed her\r\nto her seat.  Now, however, she made haste to depart, promising to visit\r\nher friend again very soon.  The little girls wanted her to arrange to\r\ncome every morning, and stay all the time of lessons: but Margaret\r\ndeclined making any such engagement.\r\n\r\nAs she went home, she scarcely raised her eyes, for fear of seeing\r\n_him_; and yet she lingered for an instant at her brother\'s door, from a\r\nfeeling of disappointment at having met no one she knew.\r\n\r\nShe had fully and undoubtingly intended to tell Hester of Philip\'s\r\narrival; but when she had taken off her bonnet, and settled herself\r\nbeside her sister in the drawing-room, she found that it was quite\r\nimpossible to open the subject.  While she was meditating upon this, the\r\nentrance of the Greys seemed to settle the matter.  She supposed they\r\nwould make the disclosure for her: but she soon perceived that they had\r\nnot heard the news.  Mrs Grey went on quoting Mrs Enderby and Phoebe,\r\nand Sophia remarked on the forsaken condition of the old lady, in a way\r\nwhich was quite incompatible with any knowledge of the new aspect which\r\naffairs had assumed this morning.  It was a great relief to Margaret to\r\nbe spared the discussion of a fact, on which so much was to be said; but\r\nlo! in the midst of a flow of talk about fomentations, and the best kind\r\nof night-light for a sick room, there was a knock at the door, every\r\nstroke of which was recognised to a certainty by Margaret.  While the\r\nother ladies were pushing back their chairs, to break up the appearance\r\nof a gossip, and make room for another party of visitors, Margaret was\r\nwholly occupied with contriving to sit upright, notwithstanding the\r\ndimness that came over her sight.\r\n\r\nIt was he.  He entered the room quickly, looked taller than ever, as\r\nSophia thought to herself, and more than ever like a Polish Count, now\r\nthat his blue great-coat was buttoned up to the chin.  He stopped for\r\nhalf a moment on seeing ladies in cloaks and bonnets, and then came\r\nforward, and shook hands with everybody.  Hester observed that he looked\r\nfull at Margaret as he held out his hand to her; but Margaret did not\r\nsee this, for, though she commanded herself wonderfully, she could not\r\nmeet his eye.  Of course, he was asked when he arrived, and had to\r\nanswer the question, and also the remarks which were made on the length\r\nof his absence, and on the expectations of everybody in Deerbrook that\r\nhe would have visited the old place at Christmas or New Year.  He was\r\nthen pitied on account of the state of his mother\'s health.  To this he\r\nmade no reply whatever; but when Mrs Grey inquired how he found Mrs\r\nEnderby, he briefly--somewhat abruptly--answered that he thought her\r\nvery ill.  It was equally impossible for Margaret to sit totally silent\r\nwhile all this was going on, and to address herself to him: she\r\ntherefore kept some conversation with Sophia on the greenhouse, and the\r\nfate of the evergreens in the shrubbery, in consequence of the severity\r\nof the frost in January--which laurestinus had been lost, and how the\r\narbutus had suffered, and how long it would be before the laurels on the\r\ngrass could grow up to their former size and beauty.  While Sophia was\r\ntelling that the greenhouse occupied a great deal of time, and that she\r\nhad therefore turned over her interest in it to Sydney, and begged the\r\nlittle girls to divide her garden between them, Mr Enderby was seen to\r\ntake Hester into the window, and after remarking upon the snowdrops\r\nbeneath, to speak privately to her.  Margaret was afraid Mrs Grey would\r\ntake the hint, and go away.  Her presence now appeared a sort of\r\nprotection, which Margaret exerted herself to retain, by not allowing\r\nthe conversation to flag.  She need not have feared; Mrs Grey was\r\nturning over in her mind how she might best introduce her\r\ncongratulations on Mr Enderby\'s engagement, and her inquiries after\r\nMiss Bruce\'s welfare--topics on which she conceived that good manners\r\nrequired her to enter.  Meantime, Mr Enderby had been saying to Hester:\r\n\r\n"You will excuse the offer of my good wishes on your settlement here\r\nbeing briefly and hastily made; but I am at this moment in great\r\nanxiety.  Is Hope at home?"\r\n\r\n"No: he is some miles off in the country."\r\n\r\n"Then I must charge you with a message to him.  I think my mother very\r\nill; and I find it is some time since Hope has seen her.  Will you beg\r\nhim to come to her without loss of time, when he returns?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly; he will be home within two or three hours, I have no doubt."\r\n\r\n"And then ask him whether he will not prescribe a visit from you to my\r\nmother.  It will do her good, I am confident.  You know she is all alone\r\nnow with her maid."\r\n\r\n"I am aware of that.  It is not from negligence or disinclination, I\r\nassure you, that we have seen so little of Mrs Enderby for some time\r\npast."\r\n\r\n"I know it, I know it," said he, shaking his head.  Then, after a\r\npause--"Shall you be at home this evening?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"And alone?"\r\n\r\n"Yes.  Will you come?"\r\n\r\n"Thank you; I will come in for an hour.  I shall then hear Hope\'s report\r\nof my mother; and--between ourselves--I want a few words with your\r\nsister.  Can you manage this for me?"\r\n\r\n"No doubt."\r\n\r\nHe was gone in another moment, with a bow to the whole party.\r\n\r\n"Gone!" cried Mrs Grey; "and I have not said a word to him about his\r\nengagement and Miss Bruce!  How very odd he must think us, Sophia!"\r\n\r\n"There will be plenty of time for all we have to say," observed Hester.\r\n"He is so uneasy about his mother, I see, that he will not leave her yet\r\nawhile."\r\n\r\nMargaret was sure she perceived in her sister\'s beautiful eye and lip\r\nthe subtle expression of amusement that they bore when a gay thought was\r\nin her mind, or when her neighbours were setting off in speculation on a\r\nwrong scent.\r\n\r\n"But half the grace of one\'s good wishes is in their being offered\r\nreadily," said Mrs Grey, "as I was saying to Sophia, the other day,\r\nwhen we were considering whether Mr Grey should not write to Mr\r\nEnderby with our congratulations.  _We_ should not like to appear\r\nbackward on such an occasion, for many reasons.  Well now, my dears; one\r\nthing more.  You must come to tea with us this evening.  It will be a\r\nmild evening, I have no doubt; and I have sent to Miss Young, to say\r\nthat my sedan will bring her at six o\'clock.  We have quite set our\r\nhearts upon having you for a sociable evening."\r\n\r\n"Thank you," said Hester: "we would come with great pleasure, but that\r\nwe are engaged."\r\n\r\n"Engaged, my dear!  Margaret has just told us that you have no\r\nengagement."\r\n\r\n"So Margaret thought: but we are engaged.  A friend of Mr Hope\'s is\r\ncoming to spend the evening, and I promised that we would be at home."\r\n\r\n"Dear!" said Sophia; "and we had quite set our hearts upon your coming."\r\n\r\n"Cannot you bring the gentleman with you, my dear?  I am sure Mr Grey\r\nwill be happy to see any friend of Mr Hope\'s."\r\n\r\n"Thank you; but he is coming on business."\r\n\r\n"Oh, well!  But Margaret can be spared, surely.  I suppose you must stay\r\nand make tea, my dear.  It would not do, I know, for you to appear to\r\nneglect your husband\'s country patients--particularly in the present\r\nstate of affairs.  But Margaret can come, surely.  Sydney shall step for\r\nher, a little before six."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes," said Sophia; "Margaret can come.  The gentleman can have no\r\nbusiness with her, I suppose."\r\n\r\nMargaret was again puzzled with the fun that lurked in the eye and lip.\r\nShe had been passive till now; but seeing Hester\'s determination that\r\nshe should not go, she said very decidedly that she should much prefer\r\ncoming some evening when her brother and sister need not be left behind.\r\n\r\n"Mrs Grey is not very well pleased," observed Margaret, when their\r\nvisitors were gone.  "Could not you have been a little more explicit as\r\nto this gentleman, whoever he may be?"\r\n\r\n"I thought it better not to say more," said Hester, now unable to help\r\nstealing a glance at her sister.  "Our visitor is to be Mr Enderby.  He\r\nis so uneasy about his mother, that my husband is to see her this\r\nafternoon; and Mr Enderby offers to come in the evening, to discuss her\r\ncase."  After a slight pause, Hester continued--"Sophia was very\r\npositive about its being impossible that our visitor could have any\r\nbusiness with you--was not she?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Hester!" said Margaret, imploringly, with her eyes full of tears.\r\n\r\n"Well, well," said Hester, remembering how cruel this speech might\r\nappear to her sister, "I ought not to speak to you from my own habitual\r\ndisbelief of Mrs Rowland\'s news.  I will go away, dear; only just\r\nsaying, first, that I like Philip\'s looks very well.  He does not seem\r\nhappier than he ought to be, while his mother is so ill: nor does he act\r\nas if he felt he had neglected us, his old friends.  As my husband says,\r\nwe must hear his own story before we judge him."\r\n\r\nWhen she left the room, Margaret could not have settled with herself\r\nwhether there was most pain or pleasure in the prospect of this evening.\r\nFive minutes before, she had believed that she should spend it at the\r\nGreys\'--should hear the monotonous hiss of the urn, which seemed to take\r\nup its song, every time she went, where it had left off last--should see\r\nMrs Grey\'s winks from behind it--should have the same sort of cake, cut\r\nby Sophia into pieces of exactly the same size--should hear Sydney told\r\nto be quiet, and the little girls to go to bed--should have to play Mrs\r\nGrey\'s favourite waltz, and sing Mr Grey\'s favourite song--and at last,\r\nto refuse a glass of sherry three times over, and come away, after\r\nhearing much wonder expressed that the evening was gone already.  Now,\r\ninstead of this, there was to be the fear and constraint of Philip\'s\r\npresence, so unlike what that had ever been before!--no longer gay,\r\neasy, and delightful, but all that was awkward.  No one would be sure of\r\nwhat the others were feeling; or whether there was any sufficient reason\r\nfor their mutual feelings being so changed.  Who would find the\r\nconversation?  What could be talked about which would not bring one or\r\nanother into collision with Mrs Rowland or Miss Bruce?  But yet, there\r\nwould be his presence, and with it, bliss.  There would be his very\r\nvoice; and something of his thoughts could not but come out.  She was\r\nbetter pleased than if his evening was to be spent anywhere else.\r\n\r\nDinner passed, she did not know how, except that her brother thought\r\nMrs Enderby not materially worse than when he saw her last.  The\r\ntea-tray came and stood an hour--Mr Hope being evidently restless and\r\non the watch.  He said at last that it would be better to get tea over\r\nbefore Enderby came; and Margaret repeated in her own mind that it _was_\r\nless awkward; and yet she was disappointed.  The moment the table was\r\ncleared, _his_ knock was heard.  He would not have tea: he had been\r\nmaking his mother\'s tea, and had had a cup with her.  And now, what was\r\nHope\'s judgment on her state of health?\r\n\r\nThe gentlemen had scarcely entered upon the subject when a note was\r\nbrought in for Margaret.  Everything made her nervous; but the purport\r\nof this note was merely to ask for a book which she had promised to lend\r\nMrs Levitt.  As she went up to her room for it, she was vexed that the\r\ninterruption had occurred now; and was heartily angry with herself that\r\nshe could command herself no better, and be no more like other people\r\nthan she fancied she had been this day.  "There is Hester," thought she,\r\n"looking nothing less than merry, and talking about whatever occurs, as\r\nif nothing had happened since we met him last; while I sit, feeling like\r\na fool, with not a word to say, and no courage to say it if I had.  I\r\nwonder whether I have always been as insignificant and dull as I have\r\nseen myself to be to-day.  I do not believe I ever thought about the\r\nmatter before: I wish I could forget it now."  Notwithstanding her\r\nfeeling of insignificance in the drawing-room, however, she was so\r\nimpatient to be there again that her hands trembled with eagerness in\r\ndoing up the parcel for Mrs Levitt.\r\n\r\nWhen she re-entered the drawing-room, Philip was there alone--standing\r\nby the fire.  Margaret\'s first impulse was to retreat; but her better\r\njudgment prevailed in time to intercept the act.  Philip said:\r\n\r\n"Mr and Mrs Hope have, at my desire, given me the opportunity of\r\nspeaking to you alone.  You must not refuse to hear what I have to say,\r\nbecause it is necessary to the vindication of my honour;--and it is also\r\ndue to another person."\r\n\r\nOf course, Margaret sat down.  She seemed to intend to speak, and Philip\r\nwaited to hear her; but no words came, so he went on.\r\n\r\n"You have been told, I find, that I have been for some time engaged to a\r\nlady who is now at Rome--Miss Bruce.  How such a notion originated, we\r\nneed not inquire.  The truth is, that I am but slightly acquainted with\r\nMiss Bruce, and that nothing has ever occurred which could warrant such\r\na use of that lady\'s name.  I heard nothing of this till to-day, and--"\r\n\r\n"Is it possible?" breathed Margaret.\r\n\r\n"I was shocked to hear of it from my poor mother; but infinitely more\r\nshocked--grieved to the very soul, to find that you, Margaret, believed\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"How could we help it?  It was your sister who told us."\r\n\r\n"What does my sister know of me compared with you?  I thought--I hoped--\r\nbut I see now that I was presumptuous--I thought that you knew me\r\nenough, and cared for me enough, to understand my mind, and trust my\r\nconduct through whatever you might hear of me from others.  I have been\r\ndeceived--I mean I have deceived myself, as to the relation in which we\r\nstand.  I do not blame you, Margaret--that is, I will not if I can help\r\nit--for what you have given credit to about me; but I did not think you\r\nwould have mortified me so deeply."\r\n\r\n"You are partly wrong now; you are unjust at this moment," replied\r\nMargaret, looking up with some spirit.  "I do not wish to speak of Mrs\r\nRowland--but remember, your mother never doubted what your sister said;\r\nthe information was given in such a way as left almost an impossibility\r\nof disbelief.  There was nothing to set against the most positive\r\nassurances--nothing from you--not a word to any of your old friends--"\r\n\r\n"And there was I, working away on a new and good plan of life, living\r\nfor you, and counting the weeks and days between me and the time when I\r\nmight come and show you what your power over me had enabled me to do--\r\nand you were all the while despising or forgetting me, allowing me no\r\nmeans of defending myself, yielding me up to dishonour with a mere shake\r\nof the head, as if I had been an acquaintance of two or three\r\nball-nights.  It is clear that you knew my mind no better than I now\r\nfind I knew yours."\r\n\r\n"What would you have had me do?" asked Margaret, with such voice as she\r\nhad.\r\n\r\n"I believe I had not thought of that," said Philip, half laughing.  "I\r\nonly felt that you ought to have trusted me--that you must have known\r\nthat I loved neither Miss Bruce, nor any one but you; and that I could\r\nnot be engaged to any one while I loved you.--Tell me at once,\r\nMargaret--did I not deserve this much from you?"\r\n\r\n"You did," said Margaret, distinctly.  "But there is another way of\r\nviewing the whole, which does not seem to have occurred to you.  I have\r\nbeen to blame, perhaps; but if you had thought of the other\r\npossibility--"\r\n\r\n"What other?  Oh! do speak plainly."\r\n\r\n"I must, at such a time as this.  If I could not think you guilty, I\r\nmight fancy myself to have been mistaken."\r\n\r\n"And did you fancy so?  Did you suppose I neither loved you, nor meant\r\nyou to think that I did?"\r\n\r\n"I did conclude myself mistaken."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Margaret!  I should say--if I dared--that such a thought--such\r\nhumility, such generosity--could come of nothing but love."\r\n\r\nMargaret made no reply.  They understood one another too completely for\r\nwords.  Even in the first gush of joy, there was intense bitterness in\r\nthe thought of what Margaret must have suffered; and Philip vowed, in\r\nthe bottom of his soul, that his whole life should be devoted to make\r\nher forget it.  He could have cursed his sister with equal energy.\r\n\r\nThere was no end to what had to be said.  Philip was impatient to tell\r\nwhat he had been doing, and the reasons of the whole of his conduct.\r\nMargaret\'s views had become his own, as to the desultoriness of the life\r\nhe had hitherto led.  He had applied himself diligently to the study of\r\nthe law, intending to prove to himself and to her, that he was capable\r\nof toil, and of a steady aim at an object in life, before he asked her\r\nto decide what their relation to each other was henceforth to be.\r\n\r\n"Surely," said he, "you might have discovered this much from my letters\r\nto my mother."\r\n\r\n"And how were we to know what was in your letters to your mother?"\r\n\r\n"Do you mean that you have not read or heard them all this time?"\r\n\r\n"Not a word for these three months.  We have scarcely seen her for many\r\nweeks past; and then she merely showed us what long letters you wrote\r\nher."\r\n\r\n"And they were all written for you!  She told me, the last time I was\r\nhere, that she could keep nothing from you: and, relying upon her words,\r\nI have supposed this to be a medium of communication between us\r\nthroughout.  I could have no other, you know.  When did my mother leave\r\noff reading my letters to you?"\r\n\r\n"From the week you went away last.  Mrs Rowland came in while we were\r\nin the midst of one; and the consequence was--"\r\n\r\n"That you have been in the dark about me ever since.  You saw that I did\r\nwrite?"\r\n\r\n"Yes.  I have seen most of the post-marks--and the interiors--upside\r\ndown.  But Mrs Rowland was always there--or else Phoebe."\r\n\r\n"And have you really known nothing about me whatever?"\r\n\r\n"Little George told me that you had lessons to learn, very hard and very\r\nlong, and, if possible, more difficult than his."\r\n\r\n"And did not you see then that I was acting upon your views?"\r\n\r\n"I supposed Miss Bruce might have had them first."\r\n\r\n"Miss Bruce!" he cried, in a tone of annoyance.  "I know nothing of Miss\r\nBruce\'s views on any subject.  I cannot conceive how my sister got such\r\na notion into her head--why she selected her."\r\n\r\nMargaret was going to mention the "sisterly affection" which had long\r\nsubsisted between Miss Bruce and Mrs Rowland, according to the latter;\r\nbut it occurred to her that it was just possible that Philip might not\r\nbe altogether so indifferent to Miss Bruce as Miss Bruce was to him; and\r\nthis thought sealed her lips.\r\n\r\n"I wonder whether Rowland believed it all the time," said Philip: "and\r\nHope?  It was unworthy of Hope\'s judgment--of his faith--to view the\r\ncase so wrongly."\r\n\r\n"I am glad you are beginning to be angry with somebody else," said\r\nMargaret.  "Your wrath seemed all to be for me: but your old friends,\r\neven to your mother, appear to have had no doubt about the matter."\r\n\r\n"There is an excuse for them which I thought you had not.  I am an\r\naltered man, Margaret--you cannot conceive how altered since I began to\r\nknow you.  They judged of me by what I was once...  We will not say how\r\nlately."\r\n\r\n"I assure you I do not forget the accounts you used to give of\r\nyourself."\r\n\r\n"What accounts?"\r\n\r\n"Of how you found life pleasant enough without philosophy and without\r\nanything to do... and other wise sayings of the kind."\r\n\r\n"It is by such things that those who knew me long ago have judged me\r\nlately--a retribution which I ought not to complain of.  If they\r\nbelieved me fickle, idle, selfish, it is all fair.  Oh!  Margaret, men\r\nknow nothing of morals till they know women."\r\n\r\n"Are you serious?"\r\n\r\n"I am solemnly persuaded of it.  Happy they who grow up beside mothers\r\nand sisters whom they can revere!  But for this, almost all men would be\r\nwithout earnestness of heart--without a moral purpose--without\r\ngenerosity, while they are all the while talking of honour.  It was so\r\nwith me before I knew you.  I am feeble enough, and selfish enough yet,\r\nGod knows! but I hope still to prove that you have made a man of me, out\r\nof a light, selfish...  But what right have I, you may think, to ask you\r\nto rely upon me, when I have so lately been what I tell you.  I did not\r\nmean to ask you yet.  This very morning, nothing could be further from\r\nmy intentions.  I do not know how long I should have waited before I\r\nshould have dared.  My sister has rendered me an inestimable service\r\namidst all the mischief she did me.  I thank her.  Ah!  Margaret, you\r\nsmile!"\r\n\r\nMargaret smiled again.  The smile owned that she was thinking the same\r\nthing about their obligations to Mrs Rowland.\r\n\r\n"Whatever you might have said to me this evening," continued Philip, "if\r\nyour regard for me had proved to have been quite overthrown--if you had\r\ncontinued to despise me, as you must have done at times--I should still\r\nhave blessed you, all my life--I should have worshipped you, as the\r\nbeing who opened a new world to me.  You lifted me out of a life of\r\ntrifling--of trifling which I thought very elegant at the time--trifling\r\nwith my own time and faculties--trifling with other people\'s serious\r\nbusiness--trifling with something more serious still, I fear--with their\r\nfeelings.  As far as I remember, I thought all this manly and refined\r\nenough: and but for you, I should have thought so still.  You early\r\nopened my eyes to all the meanness and gross selfishness of such a life:\r\nand if you were never to let me see you again, I believe I could not\r\nfall back into the delusion.  But if you will be the guide of my life--"\r\n\r\nMargaret sighed deeply.  Even at this moment of vital happiness, her\r\nthoughts rested on her sister.  She remembered what Hester\'s\r\nanticipations had been, in prospect of having Edward for the guide of\r\nher life.\r\n\r\n"I frighten you, I see," said Philip, "with my confessions; but, be the\r\nconsequences what they may, I must speak, Margaret.  If you despise me,\r\nI must do you the justice, and give myself the consolation, of\r\nacknowledging what I have been, and what I owe to you."\r\n\r\n"It is not that," said Margaret.  "Let the past go.  Let it be forgotten\r\nin reaching forward to better things.  But do not let us be confident\r\nabout the future.  I have seen too much of that.  We must not provide\r\nfor disappointment.  Let us leave it till it comes.  Surely," she added,\r\nwith a gentle smile, "we have enough for the present.  I cannot look\r\nforward yet."\r\n\r\n"How you must have suffered!" cried Philip, in a tone of grief.  "You\r\nhave lost some of your confidence, love.  You did not cling to the\r\npresent, and shrink from the future when...  Oh, it is bitter, even now,\r\nto think, that while I was working on, in hope and resolution, you were\r\nsuffering here, making it a duty to extinguish your regard for me, I all\r\nthe time toiling to deserve it--and there was no one to set us right,\r\nand the whole world in league to divide us."\r\n\r\n"That is all over now."\r\n\r\n"But not the consequences, Margaret.  They have shaken you: they have\r\nmade you know doubt and fear."\r\n\r\n"We are both changed, Philip.  We are older, and I trust it will appear\r\nthat we are wiser than we were.  Yes, older.  There are times in one\'s\r\nlife when days do the work of years and our days have been of that kind.\r\nYou have discovered a new life, and my wishes and expectations are much\r\naltered.  They may not be fewer, or less bright, but they are very\r\ndifferent."\r\n\r\n"If they were pure from fears--"\r\n\r\n"They are pure from fears.  At this moment I can fear nothing.  We have\r\nbeen brought together by the unquestionable Providence which rules our\r\nlives; and this is enough.  The present is all right; and the future,\r\nwhich is to come out of it, will be all right in its way.  I have no\r\nfear--but I do not want to anticipate.  This hour with its\r\nsatisfactions, is all that I can bear."\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this, and Philip\'s transport in learning it, they did go\r\nback, again and again, into the past; and many a glance did they cast\r\ninto the future.  There was no end to their revelations of the\r\ncircumstances of the last two months, and of the interior history which\r\nbelonged to them.  At last, the burning out of one of the candles\r\nstartled them into a recollection of how long their conversation had\r\nlasted, and of the suspense in which Edward and Hester had been kept.\r\nEnderby offered to go and tell them the fact which they must be\r\nanticipating: and, after having agreed that no one else should know at\r\npresent--that Miss Bruce\'s name should be allowed to die out of\r\nDeerbrook speculations, for Mrs Rowland\'s sake, before any other was\r\nput in its place, Philip left his Margaret, and went into the\r\nbreakfast-room, where his presence was not wholly unexpected.\r\n\r\nIn five minutes, Margaret heard the hall door shut, and, in another\r\nmoment, her brother and sister came to her.  Hester\'s face was all\r\nsmiles and tears: her mind all tumult with the vivid recollection of her\r\nown first hours of happy hopeful love, mingled with the griefs which\r\nalways lay heavy within her, and with that warm attachment to her sister\r\nwhich circumstances occasionally exalted into a passion.\r\n\r\n"We ought to rejoice with nothing but joy, Margaret," said she: "but I\r\ncannot see how we are to spare you.  I do not believe I can live without\r\nyou."\r\n\r\nHer husband started at this echo of the thoughts for which he was at the\r\nmoment painfully rebuking himself.  He had nothing to say; but gave his\r\ngreeting in a brotherly kiss, like that which he had offered on his\r\nmarriage with her sister, and on his entrance upon his home.\r\n\r\n"How quiet, how very quiet she is!" exclaimed Hester, an Margaret left\r\nthe room, after a few words on the events of the evening, and a calm\r\ngood-night.  "I hope it is all right.  I hope she is quite satisfied."\r\n\r\n"Satisfied is the word," said her husband.  "People are quiet when they\r\nare relieved--calm when they are satisfied--people like Margaret.  It is\r\nonly great minds, I believe, which feel real satisfaction."\r\n\r\nHester gave him pain by a deep sigh.  She was thinking how seldom, and\r\nfor how short a time, she had ever felt real satisfaction.\r\n\r\n"And how often, and for how long," she asked, "do great minds find\r\nthemselves in that heaven?"\r\n\r\n"By the blessing of God, not seldom, I trust," replied he; "though not\r\nso often as, by obeying their nature, they might.  Intellectual\r\nsatisfaction is perhaps not for this world, except in a few of the\r\ninspired hours of the Newtons and the Bacons, who are sent to teach what\r\nthe human intellect is.  But as often as a great mind meets with full\r\nmoral sympathy--as often as it is loved in return for love--as often as\r\nit confides itself unreservedly to the good Power which bestowed its\r\nexistence, and appointed all its attributes, I imagine it must repose in\r\nsatisfaction."\r\n\r\n"Then satisfaction ought to be no new feeling to Margaret," said Hester.\r\n"She always loves every one: she meets with sympathy wherever she\r\nturns; and I believe she has faith enough for a martyr, without knowing\r\nit.  Ought not she--must not she, have often felt real satisfaction?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"I wonder you dole out your words so sparingly about such a being as\r\nMargaret," said Hester, resentfully.  "I can tell you, Edward, though\r\nyou take so coolly the privilege of having such a one so nearly\r\nconnected with you, you might search the world in vain for her equal.\r\nYou little know the wealth of her heart and soul, Edward.  I ask you\r\nwhether she does not deserve to feel full satisfaction of conscience and\r\naffections, and you just answer `Yes,\' with as much languor as if I had\r\nasked you whether the clock has struck eleven yet!  I can tell you\r\nthis--I have said in my own heart, and just to Morris, for years, that\r\nthe happiest man of his generation will be he who has Margaret for a\r\nwife: and here you, who ought to know this, give me a grudging `Yes,\' in\r\nanswer to the first question, arising out of my reverence for Margaret,\r\nthat I ever asked you!"\r\n\r\n"You mistake me," replied Hope, in a tone of gentleness which touched\r\nher very soul.  "One\'s words may be restrained by reverence as well as\r\nby want of heart.  I regard Margaret with a reverence which I should not\r\nhave thought it necessary to put into words for your conviction."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I am wrong--as I always am!" cried Hester.  "You must forgive me\r\nagain, as you do far, far too often.  But tell me, Edward, ought not\r\nMargaret\'s husband to be the happiest man living?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Edward, with a smile.  "Will that do this time?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, yes," replied she--the thought passing through her mind, that,\r\nwhether or not her husband excepted himself as a matter of course, she\r\nshould not have asked a question to which she could not bear all\r\npossible answers.  Even if he meant that Margaret\'s husband might be a\r\nhappier man than himself, it was only too true.  As quick as lightning\r\nthese thoughts passed through her mind, and, apparently without a pause,\r\nshe went on, "And now, as to Enderby--is he worthy to be this happy\r\nhusband?  Does he deserve her?"\r\n\r\nMr Hope did pause before he replied:\r\n\r\n"I think we had better dwell as little as we can on that point of the\r\nstory--not because I am afraid--(do not take fright and suppose I mean\r\nmore than I say)--not because I am afraid, but because we can do\r\nnothing, discern nothing, about it.  Time must show what Enderby is--or\r\nrather, what he has the power of becoming.  Meanwhile, the thing is\r\nsettled.  They love and have promised, and are happy.  Let us shun all\r\ncomparison of the one with the other of them, and hope everything from\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"There will be some amusement," said Hester, after a smiling reverie,\r\n"in having this secret to ourselves for a time, while all the rest of\r\nDeerbrook is so busy with a different idea and expectation.  How _will_\r\nMrs Rowland bear it?"\r\n\r\n"Mrs Grey might have said that," said Hope, laughing.\r\n\r\n"Well, but is it not true?  Will it not be very amusing to see the\r\ncirculation of stories about Miss Bruce, given `from the best\r\nauthority,\' and to have all manner of news told us about Philip; and to\r\nwatch how Mrs Rowland will get out of the scrape she is in?  Surely,\r\nEdward, you are not above being amused with all this?"\r\n\r\n"I shall be best pleased when it is all over.  I have lived some years\r\nlonger than you in Deerbrook, and have had more time to get tired of its\r\nmysteries and mistakes."\r\n\r\n"For your comfort, then, it cannot be long before all is open and\r\nrightly understood.  We need only leave Mrs Rowland time to extricate\r\nherself, I suppose.  I wonder how she will manage it."\r\n\r\n"We shall be taken by surprise with some clever device, I dare say.  It\r\nis a pity so much ingenuity should be wasted on mischief."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN.\r\n\r\nA MORNING IN MARCH.\r\n\r\nMargaret was as calm as she appeared to be.  To a nature like hers,\r\nblissful repose was congenial, and anxiety both appeared and felt\r\nunnatural.  In her there was no weak wonder that Providence had blessed\r\nher as she felt she was blessed.  While she suffered, she concluded with\r\ncertainty that the suffering was for some good purpose; but no degree of\r\nhappiness took her by surprise, or seemed other than a natural influence\r\nshed by the great Parent into the souls of his children.  She had of\r\nlate been fearfully shaken,--not in her faith, but in her serenity.  In\r\na moment this experience appeared like a sick dream, and her present\r\ncertainty of being beloved spread its calm over her lately-troubled\r\nspirit, somewhat as her nightly devotions had done from her childhood\r\nupwards.  Even now, it was little that she thought of herself: her\r\nrecovered Philip filled her mind--he who had been a stranger--who had\r\nbeen living in a world of which she could conceive nothing--who had\r\nsuddenly vanished from her companionship, as if an earthquake had\r\nswallowed him up--and who was now all her own again, by her side, and to\r\nbe lived for.  Amidst this security, this natural and delightful state\r\nof things, that restless uneasiness--now jealousy, and now\r\nself-abasement--which she had called her own vanity and selfishness,\r\ndisappeared, and she felt like one who has escaped from the horrors of a\r\nfeverish bed into the cool fragrant airs and mild sunshine of the early\r\nmorning.  Anxieties soon arose--gentle doubts expressing themselves in\r\nsoft sighs, which were so endeared by the love from which they sprang\r\nthat she would not have banished them if she could--anxieties lest she\r\nshould be insufficient for Philip\'s happiness, lest he should overrate\r\nthe peace of home, which she now knew was not to be looked for in full\r\nmeasure there, any more than in other scenes of human probation.  Gentle\r\nquestionings like these there were; but they tended rather to preserve\r\nthan to disturb her calmness of spirit.  Misery had broken her sleep by\r\nnight, and constrained her conduct by day.  Happy love restored her at\r\nonce to her natural mood, lulling her to the deepest rest when she\r\nrested, and rendering her free and self-possessed in all the employments\r\nand intercourses of life.\r\n\r\nThere was one person who must not be kept waiting for this intelligence\r\ntill Mrs Rowland\'s return--as Margaret told Philip--and that was Maria.\r\nPhilip\'s heart was now overflowing with kindness towards all whom\r\nMargaret loved; and he spoke with strong interest of Maria, of her\r\nvirtues, her misfortunes, and the grace and promise which once bloomed\r\nin her.\r\n\r\n"You knew her before her misfortunes then?"\r\n\r\n"To be sure I did:--that was the time when I did know her; for, as you\r\nmay perceive, there is not much opportunity now.  And, besides, she is\r\nso totally changed, that I do not feel sure that I understand her\r\nfeelings--I am too much in awe of them to approach her very nearly.  Oh\r\nyes, I knew Maria Young once, much better than I know her now."\r\n\r\n"She never told me so.  How very strange!"\r\n\r\n"Does she ever speak of any other circumstance of her prosperous days?"\r\n\r\n"That is true, only incidentally."\r\n\r\n"Time was," said Philip, "when some boyish dreams connected themselves\r\nwith Maria Young--only transiently, and quite at the bottom of my own\r\nfancy.  I never spoke of them to any one before, nor fully acknowledged\r\nthem to myself.  She was the first sensible woman I ever knew--the first\r\nwho conveyed to me any conception of what the moral nature of a woman\r\nmay be, under favourable circumstances.  For this I am under great\r\nobligations to her; and this is all the feeling that I brought out of\r\nour intercourse.  It might possibly have come to more, but that I\r\ndisliked her father excessively, and left off going there on that\r\naccount.  What a selfish wretch I was in those days!  I can hardly\r\nbelieve it now; but I distinctly remember rejoicing, on hearing of her\r\naccident, that my esteem for her had not passed into a warmer feeling,\r\nas I should then have suffered so much on her account."\r\n\r\n"Is it possible?" cried Margaret, who, in the midst of the unpleasant\r\nfeeling excited by this fact, did not fail to remark to herself that\r\nthere could have been no love in such a case.\r\n\r\n"I ought, for my own sake, however, Margaret, to say that Maria Young\r\nhad not the slightest knowledge of her influence over me--superficial\r\nand transient as it was.  I never conveyed it to her by word or act; and\r\nI am thankful I did not--for this reason among many--that I am now\r\nperfectly free to show her all the kindness she deserves, both from her\r\nown merits, and from her being a beloved friend of yours."\r\n\r\nMargaret had no doubt of Philip\'s full conviction of what he was saying;\r\nbut she was far from certain that he was not mistaken--that looks and\r\ntones might not have communicated what words and acts had been forbidden\r\nto convey.  She thought of Maria\'s silence about her former acquaintance\r\nwith Philip, of her surprising knowledge of his thoughts and ways,\r\nbetraying itself to a vigilant observer through the most trivial\r\nconversation, and of her confession that there had been an attachment to\r\nsome one: and, thinking of these things, her heart melted within her for\r\nher friend.  She silently resolved upon the only method she could think\r\nof, to spare her feelings.  She would write the news of this engagement,\r\ninstead of going to tell it, as she had intended.  She was confident\r\nthat it would be no surprise to Maria; but Maria should have time and\r\nsolitude in which to reconcile herself to it.\r\n\r\nWhat was to be done about Mrs Enderby?  She had been told at once, on\r\nPhilip\'s arrival, that it was all a mistake about Miss Bruce; and she\r\nhad appeared relieved when freed from the image of an unknown\r\ndaughter-in-law.  Philip and Margaret agreed that they must deny\r\nthemselves the pleasure of revealing the rest of the truth to her, till\r\nit had been inflicted upon Mrs Rowland.  Mrs Enderby would never be\r\nable to keep it from the Greys; and she would be disturbed and alarmed\r\nin the expectation of the scenes which might ensue, when Mrs Rowland\r\nshould discover that her brother meant to choose his wife for himself,\r\ninstead of taking one of her selection.  Margaret must go and see his\r\nmother as often as possible, but her new interest in her old friend must\r\nbe concealed for the present.  How Margaret--motherless for so many long\r\nyears--felt her heart yearn towards the old lady, who seemed to be\r\neverybody\'s charge, but whom she felt now to be a sacred object of her\r\ncare!\r\n\r\nThe lovers immediately experienced some of the evils attendant on\r\nconcealment, in the difficulty of meeting as freely as they wished.\r\nThere was the breakfast-room at Mr Hope\'s for them; and, by a little\r\nmanagement on the part of brother and sister, a branching off in country\r\nwalks, out of sight of the good people of Deerbrook.  In company, too,\r\nthey were always together, and without awkwardness.  True lovers do not\r\nwant to talk together in company; they had rather not.  It is enough to\r\nbe in mutual presence; and they have nothing to say at such times, and\r\nprefer joining in what everybody else is saying.  When Philip had once\r\nput a stop to all congratulations about Miss Bruce, by earnestly and\r\nmost respectfully, though gaily, releasing that lady\'s name from all\r\nconnection with his own, no further awkwardness remained.  He treated\r\nthe affair as one of the false reports which are circulating every day,\r\nand left it for his sister to explain how she had been misled by it.  It\r\nwas amusing to the corner-house family to see that Mrs Grey and Sophia\r\ninsisted on believing that either Mr Enderby was a rejected lover of\r\nMiss Bruce\'s, or that it had been an engagement which was now broken\r\noff, or that it would soon be an engagement.  The gay state of Enderby\'s\r\nspirits accorded best with the latter supposition; but this gaiety might\r\nbe assumed, to cover his mortification.  Margaret was daily made a\r\nlistener to one or other of these suppositions.\r\n\r\nOne bright, mild, March day, Hester and Margaret were accompanying\r\nPhilip to Mr Rowland\'s to call on Mrs Enderby, when they met Mr\r\nRowland in the street,--returned the evening before from Cheltenham.\r\n\r\n"Ladies, your most obedient!" said he, stopping up the path before them.\r\n"I was on my way to call on you; but if you will step in to see Mrs\r\nEnderby, we can have our chat there."  And he at once offered his arm to\r\nMargaret, bestowing a meaning smile on Hester.  As soon as they were\r\nfairly on their way, he entered at once on the compliments it had been\r\nhis errand to pay, but spoke for himself alone.\r\n\r\n"I did not write," said he, "because I expected to deliver my good\r\nwishes in person so soon; but they are not the less hearty for being a\r\nlittle delayed.  I find, however, that I am still beforehand with my\r\nneighbours--that even Mrs Enderby does not know, nor my partner\'s\r\nfamily.  All in good time: but I am sorry for this mistake about the\r\nlady.  It is rather awkward.  I do not know where Mrs Rowland got her\r\ninformation, or what induced her to rely so implicitly upon it.  All I\r\ncan say is, that I duly warned her to be sure of her news before she\r\nregularly announced it.  But I believe such reports--oftener unfounded\r\nthan true--have been the annoyance of young people ever since there has\r\nbeen marriage and giving in marriage.  We have all suffered in our turn,\r\nI dare say, though the case is not always so broad an one as this.--\r\nCome, Mr Philip, what are you about?  Standing there, and keeping the\r\nladies standing! and I do believe you have not knocked.  Our doors do\r\nnot open of themselves, though it be to let in the most welcome guests\r\nin the world.  Now, ladies, will you walk in?  Philip will prepare Mrs\r\nEnderby to expect you up-stairs; and, meanwhile, let me show you what a\r\nsplendid jonquil we have in blow here."\r\n\r\nThe day was so mild, and the sun shone into the house so pleasantly,\r\nthat Mrs Enderby had been permitted to leave her chamber, and establish\r\nherself for the day in the drawing-room.  There she was found in a\r\nflutter of pleasure at the change of scene.  Matilda\'s canary sang in\r\nthe sunshine; Philip had filled the window with flowering plants for his\r\nmother, and the whole room was fragrant with his hyacinths.  The little\r\nGreys had sent Mrs Enderby a bunch of violets; Phoebe had made bold,\r\nwhile the gardener was at breakfast, to abstract a bough from the almond\r\ntree on the grass; and its pink blossoms now decked the mantelpiece.\r\nThese things were almost too much for the old lady.  Her black eyes\r\nlooked rather too bright, and her pale thin face twitched when she\r\nspoke.  She talked a great deal about the goodness of everybody to her,\r\nand said it was almost worth while being ever so ill to find one\'s self\r\nso kindly regarded.  It rejoiced her to see her friends around her again\r\nin this way.  It was quite a meeting of friends again.  If only her dear\r\nPriscilla, and the sweet children, had been here!--it was a great\r\ndrawback, certainly, their being away, but she hoped they would soon be\r\nback; if they had been here, there would have been nothing left to wish.\r\nHester asked if Mr Hope had visited her this morning.  She had rather\r\nexpected to meet him here, and had brought something for him which he\r\nhad wished very much to have--a letter from his brother in India.  She\r\nwas impatient till it was in his hands.  Had he made his call, or might\r\nshe expect him presently?  Mrs Enderby seemed to find difficulty in\r\ncomprehending the question; and then she could not recollect whether Mr\r\nHope had paid his visit this morning or not.  She grew nervous at her\r\nown confusion of mind--talked faster than ever; and, at last, when the\r\ncanary sang out a sudden loud strain, she burst into tears.\r\n\r\n"We are too much for her," said Hester; "let us go, we have been very\r\nwrong."\r\n\r\n"Yes, go," said Philip, "and send Phoebe.  You will find your way into\r\nthe garden, and I will join you there presently.  Rowland, you will go\r\nwith them."\r\n\r\nMargaret cast a beseeching look at Philip, and he gratefully permitted\r\nher to stay.  Hester carried off the canary.  Margaret drew down the\r\nblinds, and then kneeled by Mrs Enderby, soothing and speaking\r\ncheerfully to her, while tears, called up by a strange mixture of\r\nemotions, were raining down her cheeks.  Philip stood by the\r\nmantelpiece, weeping without restraint; the first time that Margaret had\r\never seen tears from him.\r\n\r\n"I am a silly old woman," said Mrs Enderby, half laughing in the midst\r\nof her sobs.  "Here comes Phoebe--Phoebe, I have been very silly, and I\r\nhardly know what about, I declare.  My dear!" she exclaimed as she felt\r\ntears drop upon the hand which Margaret was chafing--"my dear Miss\r\nIbbotson--"\r\n\r\n"Oh! call me Margaret!"\r\n\r\n"But, my dear, I am afraid there is something the matter, after all.\r\nSomething has happened."\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear, no, ma\'am!" said Phoebe.  "Only we don\'t like to see you in\r\nthis way."\r\n\r\n"There is nothing the matter, I assure you," said Margaret.  "We were\r\ntoo much for you; we tired you; and we are very sorry--that is all.  But\r\nthe room will be kept quite quiet now, and you will soon feel better."\r\n\r\n"I am better, my dear, thank you.  How are you sitting so low?  Bless\r\nme! you are kneeling.  Pray, my dear, rise.  To think of your kneeling\r\nto take care of me!"\r\n\r\n"Give me one kiss, and I will rise," said Margaret, bending over her.\r\nIt was a hearty kiss which Mrs Enderby gave her, for the old lady put\r\nall her energy into it.  Margaret rose satisfied; she felt as if she had\r\nbeen accepted for a daughter.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Mrs Enderby appeared disposed to shut her eyes and lie\r\nquiet, Philip and Margaret withdrew, leaving her to Phoebe\'s care.\r\nArm-in-arm they sauntered about the walks, till they came upon Hester\r\nand Mr Rowland, who were sitting in the sun, under the shelter of an\r\nevergreen hedge.\r\n\r\n"Have you heard nothing of my husband yet?" asked Hester.  "I do wish he\r\nwould come, and read this letter from Frank."\r\n\r\n"Her anxiety is purely disinterested," said Margaret to Philip.  "There\r\ncan be nothing about her in that letter.  His greetings to her will come\r\nin the next."\r\n\r\n"Edward enjoys Frank\'s letters above everything," observed Hester.\r\n\r\n"Suppose you go in next door, and we will send Hope to you when he\r\ncomes," said Philip, intending thus to set Mr Rowland free, to dismiss\r\nHester, and have Margaret to himself for a garden walk.\r\n\r\n"The Greys are all out for the day," observed Mr Rowland; "my partner\r\nand all; and this must be my excuse to you, ladies, for wishing you a\r\ngood morning.  There is a lighter at the wharf down there, whose lading\r\nwaits for me."\r\n\r\n"Ay, go," said Philip: "we have detained you long enough.  We will find\r\nour way by some means into the Greys\' grounds, and amuse ourselves\r\nthere.  If you will bid one of your people call us when Hope comes, we\r\nshall hear."\r\n\r\nBy the help of an overturned wheelbarrow, and some activity, and at the\r\nexpense of a very little detriment to the hedge, the ladies were\r\npresently landed on Mr Grey\'s territories.  By common consent, the\r\nthree directed their steps towards the end of the green walk, whence\r\nmight be seen the prospect of which the sisters were never tired.  A\r\npurple and golden crocus peeped up here and there from the turf of this\r\nwalk; there was a wilderness of daffodils on either side, the blossoms\r\njust bursting from their green sheaths; the periwinkle, with its starry\r\nflowers and dark shining sprays, overran the borders; and the hedge\r\nwhich bounded the walk was red with swollen buds.  As the gazers leaned\r\non this close-clipped, compact hedge, they overlooked a wide extent of\r\ncountry.  They stood on a sort of terrace, and below them was the field\r\nwhere the Greys\' pet animals were wont to range.  The old pony trotted\r\ntowards the terrace, as if expecting notice.  Fanny\'s and Mary\'s lambs\r\napproached and looked up, as awaiting something good.  Philip amused\r\nhimself and them with odd noises, but had nothing better for them; and\r\nso they soon scampered off, the pony throwing out his hind legs as if in\r\nindignation at his bad entertainment.  Beyond this field, a few white\r\ncottages, in the rear of the village, peeped out from the lanes, and\r\nseemed to sit down to rest in the meadows, so profound was the repose\r\nwhich they seemed to express.  The river wound quietly through the green\r\nlevel, filling its channel, and looking pearly under the light spring\r\nsky; and behind it the woods uprose, their softened masses and outlines\r\nprophesying of leafy summer shades.  Near at hand the air was alive with\r\ntwitterings: afar off, nature seemed asleep, and nothing was seen to\r\nmove but the broad sail of a wherry, and a diminished figure of a man\r\nbeside his horse, bush-harrowing in a distant green field.\r\n\r\nHester judged rightly that the lovers would like to have this scene to\r\nthemselves; and having surveyed it with that sigh of delight with which\r\nSpring causes the heart to swell, she softly stole away, and sauntered\r\ndown the green walk.  She proceeded till she reached a bench, whence she\r\ncould gaze upon the grey old church tower, rising between the\r\nintervening trees, and at the same time overlook Mr Rowland\'s garden.\r\nShe had not sat many minutes before her husband leaped the hedge, and\r\nbounded over the grass towards her.\r\n\r\n"What news?" cried he.  "There is good news in your face."\r\n\r\n"There is good news in my bag, I trust."  And she produced the large\r\nsquare epistle, marked "Ship letter" in those red characters which have\r\na peculiar power of making the heart beat.  She did not wonder that her\r\nhusband changed colour as she held up the letter.  She knew that the\r\narrival of news from Frank was a great event in life to Edward.  She\r\ngloried in being, for the first time, the medium through which this rare\r\npleasure reached him; and she longed to share, for the first time, the\r\nconfidence of a brother.  Margaret had for some months reposed upon the\r\npossession of a brother: she was now to have the same privilege.  She\r\nmade room upon the bench for her husband, and proposed to lose no time\r\nin reading the letter together.  But Hope did not sit down, though, from\r\nhis agitation, she would have supposed him glad of a seat.  He said he\r\nwould read in the shrubbery, and walked slowly away, breaking the seal\r\nas he went.  Hester was rather disconcerted; but she suppressed her\r\ndisappointment, begged him to take advantage of the bench, and herself\r\nretired into the orchard while he read his epistle.  There, as she stood\r\napparently amusing herself by the pond, wiping away a tear or two which\r\nwould have way, she little imagined what agony her husband was enduring\r\nfrom this letter, which she was supposing must make his heart overflow\r\nwith pleasure.  The letter was half full of reply to Edward\'s account of\r\nMargaret, in his epistle of last June--of raillery about her, of\r\nintreaty that Edward would give him such a sister-in-law, and of\r\nintimations that nothing could be more apparent than that the whole rich\r\ntreasure of his heart\'s love was Margaret\'s own.  Hope\'s soul sickened\r\nas he read, with that deadly sickness which he had believed was past:\r\nbut last June, with its delights and opening love, was too suddenly, and\r\ntoo vividly, re-awakened in his memory and imagination.  The Margaret of\r\nyesterday, of last month, he trusted he had arrived at regarding as a\r\nsister: not so the Margaret of last summer.  In vain he repeated, again\r\nand again, to himself, that he had expected this--that he always knew it\r\nmust come--that this was the very thing, and no more, that he had been\r\ndreading for half a year past--that it was over now--that he ought to\r\nrejoice that he held in his hand the last witness and reminder of the\r\nmistake of his life.  In vain did he repeat to himself these reasonable\r\nthings--these satisfactory truths.  They did not still the throbbing of\r\nhis brain, or relieve the agony of his spirit;--an agony under which he\r\ncould almost have cursed the hilarity of his brother as levity, and his\r\nhearty affection as cruel mockery.  He recovered some breath and\r\ncomposure when he read the latter half of Frank\'s volume of\r\ncommunication, and, before he had finished it, the sound of distant\r\nfootsteps fell upon his excited ear.  He knew they were coming--the\r\nthree who would be full of expectation as to what he should have to tell\r\nthem from India.  It was they, walking very slowly, as if waiting for\r\nthe news.\r\n\r\n"Come!" said he, starting up, and going to meet them.  "Now, to the\r\ngreen walk--we shall be quiet there--and I will read you all about\r\nFrank."\r\n\r\nHe did read them all about Frank--all the last half of the letter--\r\nHester hanging on his arm, and Philip and Margaret listening, as if they\r\nwere taking in their share of family news.  When it was done, and some\r\none said it was time to be turning homewards, Hope disengaged his arm\r\nfrom Hester, and ran off, saying that he would report of Mrs Enderby to\r\nMr Rowland in the office, and meet them before they should be out of\r\nthe shrubbery.  He did so: but he first took his way round by a fence\r\nwhich was undergoing the operation of tarring, thrust Frank\'s letter\r\ninto the fire over which the tar was heating, and saw every inch of it\r\nconsumed before he proceeded.  When he regained his party, Hester took\r\nhis arm, and turned once more towards the shrubbery, saying--\r\n\r\n"We have plenty of time, and I am not at all tired: so now read me the\r\nrest."\r\n\r\n"My love, I have read you all I can."\r\n\r\nHester stopped short, and with flashing eyes, whose fire was scarcely\r\ndimmed by her tears, cried--\r\n\r\n"Do you mean to give me no more of your confidence than others?  Is your\r\nwife--"\r\n\r\n"My dear, it is not my confidence: it is Frank\'s."\r\n\r\n"And is not Frank my brother?  He is nothing to them."\r\n\r\n"He was not your brother when this letter was written, nor did he know\r\nthat he should ever be so.  Consider this letter as one of old time--as\r\nbelonging to the antiquity of our separate lives.  I hope there will\r\nnever be another letter from Frank, or anybody else (out of the range of\r\nmy professional affairs) whose contents will not be as much yours as\r\nmine.  This must satisfy you now, Hester; for I can tell you no more.\r\nThis ought to satisfy you."\r\n\r\n"It does not satisfy me.  I never will be satisfied with giving all, and\r\nhaving nothing in return.  I have given you all.  Not a thought has\r\nthere been in my heart about Margaret, from the day we married, that I\r\nhave not imparted to you.  Has it not been so?"\r\n\r\n"I believe it, and I thank you for it."\r\n\r\n"And what is it to you to have a sister--you who have always had\r\nsisters--what is it to you, in comparison with my longing to have a\r\nbrother?  And now you make him no more mine than he is Margaret\'s and\r\nPhilip\'s.  He himself, if he has the heart of a brother, would cry out\r\nupon you for disappointing me."\r\n\r\n"I can allow for your feelings, Hester.  I have known too well what\r\ndisappointment is, not to feel for you.  But here the fault is not\r\nmine."\r\n\r\n"Whose is it then?  It is to be charged upon Providence, I suppose, like\r\nmost of our evils."\r\n\r\n"No, Hester; I charge it upon you.  The disappointment was unavoidable;\r\nbut the sting of it lies in yourself.  You are unreasonable.  It is at\r\nyour own request that I remind you to be reasonable."\r\n\r\n"And when was that request made?  When I believed that you would hold me\r\nyour friend--that no others were to come near my place in your\r\nconfidence--that all you cared for was to be equally mine--that your\r\nbrother himself was to be my brother.  It was when you promised me these\r\nthings that I put my conscience and my feelings into your charge.  But\r\nnow all that is over.  You are as much alone in your own soul as ever,\r\nand I am thrust out from it as if you were like other men...  Oh!" she\r\ncried, covering her face with her hands, "call me your housekeeper at\r\nonce--for I am not your wife--and breathe not upon my conscience--look\r\nnot into my heart--for what are they to you?  I reclaim from you, as\r\nyour servant, the power I gave you over my soul, when I supposed I was\r\nto be your wife."\r\n\r\n"Now you must hear me, Hester.  Sit down; for you cannot stand under the\r\ntempest of your own feelings.  Now, what are the facts out of which all\r\nthis has arisen?  I have had a letter, written before we were known to\r\nbe engaged, containing something which is confided to my honour.  We had\r\nboth rather that such had not been the case.  Would you now have me\r\nviolate my honour?  Let us have done.  The supposition is too\r\nridiculous."\r\n\r\n"But the manner," pleaded Hester.  "It is not curiosity about the\r\nletter.  I care nothing if it contained the affairs of twenty nations.\r\nBut, oh! your manner was cruel.  If you loved me as you once did, you\r\ncould not treat me exactly as you treat Margaret and Philip.  You do not\r\nlove me as you once did...  You do not answer me," she continued in a\r\ntone of wretchedness.  "Nay, do not answer me now.  It will not satisfy\r\nme to hear you say upon compulsion that you love me.  Ah!  I had\r\nMargaret once; and once I had you.  Philip has taken my Margaret from\r\nme; and if you despise me, I will lie down and die."\r\n\r\n"Fear not!" said Hope, with great solemnity.  "While I live you shall be\r\nhonoured, and have such rest as you will allow to your own heart.  But\r\ndo you not see that you have now been distrusting me--not I you?  Shall\r\nI begin to question whether you love me?  Could you complain of\r\ninjustice if I did, when you have been tempting my honour, insulting my\r\ntrust in you, and wounding my soul?  Is this the love you imagine I\r\ncannot estimate and return?  This is madness, Hester.  Rouse yourself\r\nfrom it.  Waken up the most generous part of yourself.  We shall both\r\nhave need of it all."\r\n\r\n"Oh, God! what do you intend?  Consider again, before you break my\r\nheart, if you mean to say that we must...  Edward! forgive me, Edward!"\r\n\r\n"I mean to say that we must support each other under troubles of God\'s\r\nsending, instead of creating woes of our own."\r\n\r\n"Support each other!  Thank Heaven!"\r\n\r\n"I see how your spirit rouses itself at the first sound of threatening\r\nfrom without.  I knew it would.  Rough and trying times are coming,\r\nlove, and I must have your support.  Trouble is coming--daily and hourly\r\nannoyance, and no end of it that I can see: and poverty, perhaps,\r\ninstead of the ease to which we looked forward when you married me.  I\r\ndo not ask you whether you can bear these things, for I know you can.  I\r\nshall look to you to help me to keep my temper."\r\n\r\n"Are you not mocking me?" doubtfully whispered Hester.\r\n\r\n"No, my love," her husband replied, looking calmly in her face.  "I know\r\nyou to be a friend made for adversity."\r\n\r\n"Let it come, then!" exclaimed she.  And she felt herself on the\r\nthreshold of a new life, in which all the past might yet be redeemed.\r\n\r\nThey soon rejoined Margaret, and went home to relate and to hear what\r\nnew threats the day had disclosed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY EIGHT.\r\n\r\nDEERBROOK COMMOTIONS.\r\n\r\nAmong many vague threats, there was one pretty definite menace which had\r\nencountered Hope from various quarters of late.  By whose agency, and by\r\nwhat means, he did not know, but he apprehended a design to supplant him\r\nin his practice.  There was something more meant than that Mr Foster\r\nfrom Blickley appeared from time to time in the village.  Hope imagined\r\nthat there was a looking forward to somebody else, who was to cure all\r\nmaladies as soon as they appeared, and keep death at a distance from\r\nDeerbrook.  It seemed to be among the poor people chiefly that such an\r\nexpectation prevailed.  Philip was sure that Mr Rowland knew nothing of\r\nit, nor Mrs Enderby.  Mr Grey, when spoken to, did not believe it, but\r\nwould quietly and discreetly inquire.  Mrs Grey was sure that the\r\nDeerbrook people would not venture to discountenance altogether any one\r\nwho had married into their connection so decidedly.  Her young folks\r\nwere to hear nothing of the matter, as it would not do to propagate an\r\nidea which might bring about its own accomplishment.\r\n\r\nAt the almshouses to-day, the threat had been spoken plainly enough; and\r\nHope had found his visit there a very unpleasant one.  It had been\r\nwholly disagreeable.  When within a mile and a half of the houses, a\r\nstone had been thrown at him from behind a hedge.  It narrowly missed\r\nhim.  A little further on, there was another, from the opposite side of\r\nthe road.  This indication was not to be mistaken.  Hope leaped his\r\nhorse over a gate, and rode about the field, to discover who had\r\nattacked him.  For some time he could see no one; but, on looking more\r\nclosely to the fence, he saw signs in one part that hedging was going\r\non.  As he approached the spot, a labourer rose up from the ditch, and\r\nwas suddenly very busy at his work.  He looked stupid, and denied having\r\nthrown any stones, but admitted that there was nobody else in the field\r\nthat he knew of.  Further on, more stones were thrown: it was evidently\r\na conspiracy; but Hope could find no one to call to account for it, but\r\nan old woman in one case, and two boys in another.--As he rode up to the\r\nalmshouses, the aged inmates came out to their doors, or looked from\r\ntheir fanciful Gothic windows, with every indication of displeasure in\r\ntheir faces and manner.  The old women shook their heads at him, and\r\nsome their fists; the old men shook their sticks at him.  He stopped to\r\nspeak to one man of eighty-three, who was sitting in the sun at his\r\ndoor; but he could get no answer out of him, nothing but growls about\r\nthe doctor being a pretty doctor not to have mended his patient\'s\r\neye-sight yet.  Not a bit better could he see now than he could a year\r\nago, with all the doctoring he had had: and now the gentleman would not\r\ntry anything more!  A pretty doctor, indeed!  But it would not be long\r\nbefore there would be another who would cure poor people\'s eyes as if\r\nthey were rich: and poor people\'s eyes were as precious to them as rich\r\npeople\'s.--He next went into a house where an aged woman was confined to\r\nbed with rheumatism; but her gossips stopped him in the middle of the\r\nroom, and would not let him approach her, for fear he should be her\r\ndeath.  As she had been lying awake the night before, she had heard her\r\ndeceased husband\'s shoes dance of their own accord in the closet; and\r\nthis was a sign that something was going to happen to somebody.  She\r\nthought of the doctor at the time, and prayed that he might be kept from\r\ncoming near her; for she knew he would be the death of her, somehow, as\r\nhe had been of other folks.  So Hope was obliged to leave her and her\r\nrheumatism to the gossips.  The particular object of his visit to the\r\nplace to-day, however, was a little girl, a grandchild of one of the\r\npensioners, admitted by special favour into the establishment.  This\r\ngirl had small-pox, and her case was a severe one.  Hope was admitted\r\nwith unwillingness even to her, and was obliged to assume his ultimate\r\ndegree of peremptoriness of manner with her nurses.  He found her\r\nmuffled up about the head with flannel, and with a slice of fat bacon,\r\nfolded in flannel, tied about her throat,--a means considered a specific\r\nfor small-pox in some regions.  The discarding of the flannel and bacon,\r\nof course, caused great offence; and there was but too much reason to\r\nfear that all his directions as to the management of the girl would be\r\nobserved by contraries, the moment his back was turned.  He had long ago\r\nfound explanation and argument to be useless.  All that he could do was,\r\nto declare authoritatively, that if his directions were not followed,\r\nthe girl would die, and her death would lie at the door of her nurses;\r\nthat, in that case, he expected some of the people about her would be\r\nill after her; but that if he was obeyed, he trusted she might get\r\nthrough, and nobody else be the worse.  Almost before he was out of the\r\nhouse, another slice of fat bacon was cut, and the flannels put to the\r\nfire to heat again.\r\n\r\nHope mounted his horse to depart, just at the hour when the labourers\r\nwere at their dinners in all the cottages around.  They poured out to\r\nstare at him, some shouting that they should not have him long to look\r\nat, as they would get a better doctor soon.  Some sent their dogs\r\nyelping at his horse\'s heels, and others vented wrath or jokes about\r\nchurchyards.  Soon after he had left the noise behind him, he met Sir\r\nWilliam Hunter, riding, attended by his groom.  Hope stopped him, making\r\nit his apology that Sir William might aid in saving the life of a\r\npatient, in whom he was much interested.  He told the story of the\r\nsmall-pox, of the rural method of treating it with which he had to\r\ncontend, and proposed that Sir William should use his influence in\r\nsecuring for the patient a fair chance of her life.  Sir William\r\nlistened coolly, would certainly call at the almshouses and make\r\ninquiry; but did not like to interfere with the notions of the people\r\nthere: made a point indeed of leaving them pretty much to their own\r\nways; owned that it would be a pity the girl should die, if she really\r\nmight be got through; would call, therefore, and inquire, and see\r\nwhether Lady Hunter could not send down anything from the Hall.  He\r\nsmiled rather incredulously when assured that it was not anything that\r\ncould be sent down from the Hall that was wanted by the patient, but\r\nonly the use of the fresh air that was about her, and the observance of\r\nher doctor\'s simple directions.  Sir William next began to make his\r\nhorse fidget, and Hope took the hint.\r\n\r\n"This has been my business with you at present," said he.  "At some more\r\nconvenient time, I should be glad of a little conversation with you on\r\nother matters connected with these almshouses."\r\n\r\nSir William Hunter bowed, put spurs to his horse, and galloped off, as\r\nif life or death depended on his reaching the Hall in three minutes and\r\na half.\r\n\r\nThese hints of "another doctor"--"a better doctor"--"a new man"--met\r\nHope in other directions.  Mrs Howell was once quoted as a whisperer of\r\nthe fact; and the milliner\'s young lady was known to have speculated, on\r\nwhether the new doctor would prove to be a single man.  No one turned\r\naway from such gossip with more indifference than Hope; but it came to\r\nhim in the form of inquiries which he was supposed best able to answer.\r\nHe now told Hester of them all; warned her of the probable advent of a\r\nrival practitioner; and at the same time urged upon her a close economy\r\nin the management of the house, as his funds were rapidly failing.  If\r\nhis practice continued to fall off as it was now doing, he scarcely saw\r\nhow they were to keep up their present mode of living.  It grieved him\r\nextremely to have to say this to his wife in the very first year of\r\ntheir marriage.  He had hoped to have put larger means in her power,\r\nfrom year to year; but at present he owned his way was far from being\r\nclear.  They had already descended to having no prospect at all.\r\n\r\nFor all this Hester cared little.  She had never known the pinchings of\r\npoverty, any more than the embarrassments of wealth.  She could not\r\nconceive of such a thing, as being very anxious about what they should\r\neat, and what they should drink, and wherewith they should be clothed;\r\nthough, if she had looked more narrowly at her own imaginations of\r\npoverty, she would perhaps have discovered on the visionary table always\r\na delicate dish for her husband--in the wardrobe, always a sleek black\r\ncoat--and in his waiting-room, a clear fire in winter; while the rest of\r\nthe picture was made up of bread and vegetables, and shabby gowns for\r\nherself, and devices to keep herself warm without burning fuel.  Her\r\nimagination was rather amused than alarmed with anticipations of this\r\nsort of poverty.  It was certainly not poverty that she dreaded.  A more\r\nserious question was, how she could bear to see her husband supplanted,\r\nand, in the eyes of others, disgraced.  This question the husband and\r\nwife now often asked each other, and always concluded by agreeing that\r\ntime must show.\r\n\r\nThe girl at the almshouses died in a fortnight.  Some pains were taken\r\nto conceal from the doctor the time and the precise spot of her\r\nburial-points which the doctor never thought of inquiring about, and of\r\nwhich it was therefore easy to keep him in ignorance.  A few of the\r\nneighbouring cottagers agreed to watch the grave for ten nights, to save\r\nthe body from the designs of evil surgeons.  One of the watchers\r\nreported, after the seventh night, that he had plainly heard a horse\r\ncoming along the road, and that he rather thought it stopped opposite\r\nthe churchyard.  He had raised himself up, and coughed aloud, and that\r\nwas no doubt the reason why nobody came: the horse must have turned back\r\nand gone away, whoever might be with it.  This put people on the watch;\r\nand on the eighth night two men walked about the churchyard.  They had\r\nto tell that they once thought they had caught the doctor in the fact.\r\nThey had both heard a loud whistle, and had stood to see what would come\r\nof it (they could see very well, for it had dawned some time).  A person\r\ncame through the turnstile with a sack, which seemed to leave his\r\nintentions in no doubt.  They hid themselves behind two opposite trees,\r\nand both sprang out upon him at once: but it was only the miller\'s boy\r\non his way to the mill.  On the ninth and tenth nights nothing happened;\r\nthe neighbours began to feel the want of their regular sleep; and the\r\nquerulous grandmother, who seemed more angry that they meant to leave\r\nthe poor girl\'s body to itself now, than pleased that it had been\r\nwatched at all, was compelled to put up with assurances that doctors\r\nwere considered to wish to cut up bodies within the first ten days, if\r\nat all, and were not apt to meddle with them afterwards.\r\n\r\nIt was full three weeks from this time when Hope was sent for to the\r\nalmshouses, after a longer interval than he had ever known to elapse\r\nwithout the old folks having some complaint to make.  The inmate who was\r\nnow ill was the least aged, and the least ignorant and unreasonable\r\nperson, in the establishment.  He was grateful to Hope for having\r\nrestored him from a former illness; and, though now much shaken in\r\nconfidence, had enough remaining to desire extremely to see his old\r\nfriend, when he found himself ill and in pain.  His neighbours wondered\r\nat him for wishing to court destruction by putting himself again into\r\nthe hands of the suspicious doctor: but he said he could have no ease in\r\nhis mind, and was sure he should never get well till he saw the\r\ngentleman\'s face again; and he engaged an acquaintance to go to\r\nDeerbrook and summon him.  This acquaintance spread the fact of his\r\nerrand along the road as he went; and therefore, though Hope took care\r\nto choose his time, so as not to ride past the cottage-doors while the\r\nlabourers were at dinner, his visit was not more private or agreeable\r\nthan on the preceding occasion.\r\n\r\nThe first symptom of his being expected on the road was, that Sir\r\nWilliam Hunter, riding, as before, with his groom behind him, fell in\r\nwith Hope, evidently by design.\r\n\r\nSir William Hunter\'s visit to the almshouses had produced the effect of\r\nmaking him acquainted with the discontents of the people, and had\r\nafforded him a good opportunity of listening to their complaints of\r\ntheir surgeon, without being troubled with the answers.  Since the\r\nelection, he had been eager to hear whatever could be said against Hope,\r\nwhose vote, given contrary to Sir William\'s example and influence, was\r\nregarded by the baronet as an unpardonable impertinence.\r\n\r\n"So you lost your patient down there, I find," said Sir William, rudely.\r\n"The girl slipped through your fingers, after all.  However, I did my\r\nduty by you.  I told the people they ought to allow you a fair chance."\r\n\r\n"I requested your interference on the girl\'s account, and not on my\r\nown," said Hope.  "But as you allude to my position among these people,\r\nyou will allow me to ask, as I have for some time intended, whether you\r\nare aware of the treatment to which I am subjected, in your\r\nneighbourhood, and among your dependants?"\r\n\r\n"I find you are not very popular hereabouts, indeed, sir," replied the\r\nbaronet, with a half-smile, which was immediately reflected in the face\r\nof the groom.\r\n\r\n"With your leave, we will have our conversation to ourselves," said\r\nHope.\r\n\r\nThe baronet directed his groom to ride on slowly.  Hope continued:\r\n\r\n"The extreme ignorance of the country people has caused some absurd\r\nstories against me to be circulated and believed.  If those who are not\r\nin this state of extreme ignorance will do me justice, and give me, as\r\nyou say, a fair chance, I have no fear but that I shall live down\r\ncalumnies, and, by perseverance in my professional duty, recover the\r\nstation I lately held here.  This justice, this fair chance, I claim,\r\nSir William, from all who have the intelligence to understand the case,\r\nand rightly observe my conduct.  I have done my best in the service of\r\nthese pensioners of yours; and excuse my saying that I must be protected\r\nin the discharge of my duty."\r\n\r\n"Ay, there\'s the thing, Mr Hope.  That can\'t be done, you see.  If the\r\npeople do not like you, why then the only thing is for you to stay\r\naway."\r\n\r\n"Then what is to become of the sick?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, there\'s the thing, Mr Hope.  If they do not like one, you see, why\r\nthen they must try another.  That is what we have been thinking.  Now,\r\nif you take my advice, you will not go forward to-day.  You will repent\r\nit if you do, depend upon it.  They do not like you, Mr Hope."\r\n\r\n"I need no convincing of that.  You do not seem disposed to stir, Sir\r\nWilliam, to improve the state of things; so I will go and try what I can\r\ndo by myself."\r\n\r\n"I advise you not, sir.--Mr Hope!" shouted Sir William, as Hope rode\r\nrapidly forward, "take care what you are about.  They do not want to see\r\nyou again.  The consequences may be serious."\r\n\r\n"And this man is a magistrate, and he fancies himself my patron!"\r\nthought Hope, as he rode on.  "He wants me to throw up the appointment;\r\nbut I will not, till I see that the poor old creatures can be consigned\r\nto care as good as my own.  If he chooses to dismiss me, he may, though\r\nwe can ill afford the loss just now."\r\n\r\nFor one moment he had thought of turning back, as Sir William\'s caution\r\nhad seemed to foretell some personal risk in proceeding; but the\r\nremembrance of Hester\'s parting look inspired him afresh.  Instead of\r\nthe querulous anxiety which had formerly harassed him from its\r\ngroundlessness and apparent selfishness, it was now an anxiety worthy of\r\nthe occasion that flushed her cheek.  So far from entreating him to\r\nremain with her, she had bidden him go where his duty led him.  She had\r\ncalculated the probable length of his absence, and the watch was laid on\r\nthe table as formerly: but she had used the utmost expedition in sewing\r\non the ring of his umbrella, and had kissed her hand to him from the\r\nwindow with a smile.  He would not return to her without having fully\r\ndischarged his errand.  "She might be a soldier\'s or sailor\'s wife,\r\nafter all," thought he.\r\n\r\nThe hours of his absence were indeed very anxious ones to the family at\r\nhome.  For nearly two hours, the sisters amused themselves and one\r\nanother as well as they could: but it was a great relief when Philip\r\ncame in.  He would not believe anything they said, however, about their\r\nreasons for fear.  It was nonsense--it was Deerbrook talk.  What harm\r\ncould a dozen old men and women, at almost a hundred years apiece, do to\r\nHope?--and the country people, the labourers round, they had their own\r\nbusiness to attend to: they would just swear an oath at him, and let him\r\npass; and if they ventured to lay a finger on his bridle, Hope knew how\r\nto use his whip.  He would come home, and get his dinner, and be very\r\ndull, they would see, from having nothing to tell.--Before Philip had\r\nfinished his picture of the dull dining they might expect, Morris\r\nentered, and shut the door before she came forward to the table and\r\nspoke.  She said she did not like to make mysteries, out of fear of\r\nfrightening people; and she hoped there would be nothing to be really\r\nafraid of now: but if Mr Enderby thought he could contrive to meet her\r\nmaster out on the road, and get him to leave his horse somewhere, and\r\ncome walking home by Turnstile Lane, she thought it would be best, and\r\nsave some bad language, at least.  Charles had brought in word that\r\npeople--angry people--were gathering at the other end of the street, and\r\nher master could quite disappoint them by coming home on foot the back\r\nway.--How many angry people were there!--and what sort of people?--They\r\nwere mostly countrymen out of the places round--more of those than of\r\nDeerbrook folks.  There were a good many of them--so many as nearly to\r\nblock up the street at one part.  If the ladies would step up into the\r\nboy\'s attic, they would see something of what was going on, from the\r\nlittle window there, without being seen.\r\n\r\nPhilip snatched his hat, and said he would soon bring them news.  He\r\nhoped they would go up to the attic, and amuse themselves with the show:\r\nfor a mere show it would end in being, he was confident.  He observed,\r\nhowever, that it would be as well to keep Charles at home, in case, as\r\nwas possible, of a messenger being wanted.  He himself would soon be\r\nback.\r\n\r\nCharles was called up into the drawing-room, and questioned.  Never\r\nbefore having been of so much importance, he was very grand in his\r\nstatements, and made the most of all he had to say.  Still, however, it\r\nwas a story which no telling could have made other than an unpleasant\r\none.  Some of the people who had come in from the country had\r\npitchforks.  Two or three of the shopkeepers had put up their shutters.\r\nMany strangers were in the churchyard, peeping about the new graves: and\r\nothers had set scouts on the road, to give notice when master was\r\ncoming.  Mrs Plumstead was very busy scolding the people all round; but\r\nit did not do any good, for they only laughed at her.\r\n\r\n"You may go, Charles; but do not set foot out of the house till you are\r\nbid," said Hester, when she found the boy had told all he knew, and\r\nperhaps something more.  Morris left the room with him, in order to keep\r\nher eye upon him.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Margaret, this is very terrible!" said Hester.\r\n\r\n"Most disagreeable.  We must allow something for Charles\'s way of\r\ntelling the story.  But yet--is there anything we can do, Hester?"\r\n\r\n"Mr Grey will surely be here, presently.  Do not you think so?"\r\n\r\n"Either he or Mr Rowland, no doubt."\r\n\r\n"Dr Levitt is a magistrate: but this is Saturday, and he is so deep in\r\nhis sermon, he could not be made to understand and believe till it would\r\nbe too late.--Do you go up to the attic, Margaret, and I will keep the\r\nhall door.  I shall hear his horse sooner than any one, and I shall\r\nstand ready to open to him in an instant.  Hark now!"\r\n\r\nIt was only the boy with the post-bags, trotting slowly to Mrs\r\nPlumstead\'s, amusing himself by the way with observations on the unusual\r\nanimation of Deerbrook.\r\n\r\n"It is too soon yet, by half an hour," said Margaret.  "He cannot\r\npossibly be here for this half-hour, I think.  Do not wear yourself out\r\nwith standing in the hall so long.  I must just say one thing, love, I\r\nfear all kinds of danger less for Edward than for almost any one else in\r\nthe world: he does always what is most simple and right; and I think he\r\ncould melt anybody\'s heart if he tried."\r\n\r\n"Thank you," said Hester, gratefully.  "I agree and trust with you: but\r\nwhat hearts have these people? or, how can you get at them, through such\r\nheads?  But yet he will triumph, I feel."\r\n\r\nWhen Margaret went up-stairs to the attic window, Hester moved a chair\r\ninto the hall, softly opened the window a little, to facilitate her\r\nhearing whatever passed outside, and took her seat by it, listening\r\nintently.  There was soon but too much to listen to.  Shuffling feet\r\nmultiplied about the door; and some of the grumbling voices seemed to\r\ncome from men who had stationed themselves on the steps.  Hester rose,\r\nand, with the utmost care to avoid noise, put up the chain of the house\r\ndoor.  While she was doing this, Morris came from the kitchen, for the\r\nsame purpose.  She feared there was an intention to surround the house:\r\nshe wished her master would keep away, for a few hours at least; she\r\ncould not think where all the gentlemen of the place were, that they did\r\nnot come and see after her young ladies.  Before the words were uttered,\r\nthere was a loud rap at the door.  Morris made her mistress keep back,\r\nwhile she found out who it was, before letting down the chain.  Hester\r\nknew it was not her husband\'s knock; and it turned out to be Mr Grey\'s.\r\nMargaret came flying down, and they all exclaimed how glad they were to\r\nsee him.\r\n\r\n"I wish I could do you any good," said he; "but this is really a sad\r\nbusiness, my dears."\r\n\r\n"Have you heard anything, sir?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing about your husband.  Enderby bade me tell you that he is gone\r\nout to meet him, and to stir up Sir William Hunter, who may be said to\r\nbe the cause of all this, inasmuch as he never attempted to stop the\r\ndiscontent when he might.  But that unlucky vote, my dear, that was much\r\nto be deplored."\r\n\r\n"No use casting that up now, surely," observed Morris.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Morris, there is," said her mistress; "it gives me an opportunity\r\nof saying that I glory in the vote; and I would have my husband give it\r\nagain to-day, if he had to pass through yonder crowd to go up to the\r\npoll."\r\n\r\n"My dear," remonstrated Mr Grey, "be prudent.  Do not urge your husband\r\non into danger: he has quite enthusiasm enough without; and you see what\r\ncomes of it.--But I am here to say that my wife hopes you and Margaret\r\nwill retire to our house, if you can get round without bringing any of\r\nthese troublesome people with you.  We think you might slip out from the\r\nsurgery, and along the lane, and through the Rowlands\' garden door, and\r\nover the hedge which they tell me you managed to climb one day lately\r\nfor pleasure.  By this way, you might reach our house without any one\r\nbeing the wiser."\r\n\r\n"On no account whatever," said Hester.  "I shall not leave home, under\r\nany circumstances."\r\n\r\n"You are very kind," said Margaret; "but we are expecting my brother\r\nevery moment."\r\n\r\n"But he will follow you by the same road."\r\n\r\nBoth wife and sister were sure he would do no such thing.  They thought\r\nthe kindest thing Mr Grey could do would be to go out the back way, and\r\nsee that the constable was kept up to his duty.  He promised to do so;\r\nand that he would speak to Dr Levitt, to have some of Grey and Rowlands\r\nmen sworn in as special constables, if such a measure should appear to\r\nbe desirable.\r\n\r\n"I do not know how to believe all this now," said Margaret; "it seems so\r\ncauseless and ridiculous!  In Birmingham we could never have given\r\ncredit to the story of such a riot about nothing."\r\n\r\nMorris was not sure of this.  In large towns there were riots sometimes\r\nfor very small matters, or on account of entire mistakes.  She had\r\nalways heard that one of the worst things about living in a village is,\r\nthat when the people once get a wrong idea into their heads, there is no\r\ngetting it out again; and that they will even be violent upon it against\r\nall reason; but such things she knew to happen occasionally in towns.\r\n\r\nAnother knock.  It was Mr Rowland, and Hester\'s heart turned sick at\r\nthere being no news of her husband.  Mr Rowland had every expectation,\r\nof course, that Mr Hope would be quite safe, and that this would turn\r\nout a disturbance of very slight consequence: but he would just ask\r\nwhether it would not be advisable to close the window-shutters.  If\r\nstones should find their way into the parlours, it might be disagreeable\r\nto the ladies.--There was no doubt of that: but would not closing the\r\nshutters be a hint to the people outside to throw stones?--Well, perhaps\r\nso.  He only thought he would offer the suggestion, and see if he could\r\nbe of any service to the ladies.\r\n\r\n"Morris, go up to the attic and watch; and Margaret, do you stay here.\r\nYes, Mr Rowland," said Hester, fixing her glorious eyes full on him;\r\n"you can be of service to us, if my husband outlives this day.  You\r\nought to pray that he may; for if not, it is your wife who has murdered\r\nhim."\r\n\r\nMr Rowland turned as pale as ashes.\r\n\r\n"We know well that you have no share in all this injury: we believe that\r\nyou respect my husband, and have friendly feelings towards us all.  I\r\nwill spare you what I might say--what Mrs Rowland should sink to the\r\nearth to hear, if she were standing where you stand.  I look upon you as\r\nno enemy--"\r\n\r\n"You do me only justice," said Mr Rowland, leaning upon the chair which\r\nHester had brought for herself.\r\n\r\n"I wish to do you justice; and therefore I warn you that if you do not\r\nprocure complete protection for my husband--not only for this day--but\r\nfor the future;--if you do not cause your wife to retract her\r\nslanders--"\r\n\r\n"Stop, Mrs Hope! this is going too far," said Mr Rowland, drawing\r\nhimself up, and putting on an air of offended dignity.\r\n\r\n"It is not going too far.  You cannot, you dare not, pretend to be\r\noffended with what I say, when you know that my noble husband has been\r\ninjured in his character and his prospects, attacked in his domestic\r\npeace, and now exposed to peril of his life, by the falsehoods your wife\r\nhas told.  I tell you that we do not impute her crimes to you.  If this\r\nis justice, you will prove it by doing your full duty to my husband.  If\r\nyou decline any part of this duty--if you countenance her slanders--if\r\nyou shrink from my husband\'s side in whatever we may have to go\r\nthrough--if you do not either compel your wife to do us right, or do it\r\nyourself in opposition to her--you are her partner in guilt, as well as\r\nin life and lot."\r\n\r\n"Consider what a situation you place me in!--But what would you have me\r\ndo?"\r\n\r\n"I would have you see that every false charge she has brought is\r\nretracted--every vile insinuation recanted.  You must make her say\r\neverywhere that my husband has not stolen dead bodies; that he is not a\r\nplotter against the peace and order of society; that he has not poisoned\r\na child by mistake, or cut off a sound limb for the sake of practice and\r\namusement.  Your wife has said these things, and you know it; and you\r\nmust make her contradict them all."\r\n\r\n"Consider what a situation you place me in!" said Mr Rowland again.\r\n\r\n"Be generous, Hester!" said Margaret.\r\n\r\n"Do not trample on a wretched man!" cried Mr Rowland, covering his face\r\nwith his hands.\r\n\r\n"`Consider!\'  `Be generous!\'" exclaimed Hester in a softened tone.  "I\r\nmight well say, Consider what a situation my husband is placed in! and\r\nthat I must see justice done to him before I can be generous to others;\r\nbut I have such a husband that I can afford to spare the wretched, and\r\nbe generous to the humbled.  Go now and do _your_ duty by us: and the\r\nnext time you hear your wife say that we do not love and are not happy,\r\ntell her that if we forbear to crush her, it is because we are too\r\nstrong for her--too strong in heart, however weak in fortunes:--because\r\nwe are strong in a peace which she cannot poison, and a love which she\r\nwill never understand."\r\n\r\nEven at a moment like this, and while feeling that she could not have\r\nsaid the things that Hester said, Margaret\'s eyes swam in tears of joy.\r\nHere was her sister, in a moment of that high excitement when nothing\r\nbut truth ventures upon utterance, acknowledging herself blessed in\r\npeace which could not be poisoned, and love which the vile could not\r\nunderstand.  The day, whatever might be its events, was worth enduring\r\nfor this.\r\n\r\nMr Rowland walked once or twice up and down the hall, wiped his brows,\r\nand then, evidently unable to endure Hester\'s presence, said he would\r\nlet himself out, and there await Mr Hope\'s arrival, or anything else\r\nthat might occur.\r\n\r\nOh! would he ever come?  It seemed to Hester like a week since she had\r\ngiven him his umbrella, and seen him ride away.\r\n\r\nHark!  Surely this must be--it certainly was his horse this time.  Yes--\r\nthere was Morris calling from the stairs that her master was fighting\r\nhis way down the street!  There was Charles giving notice that the crowd\r\nwas running round from the back to the front of the house!  There was\r\nthe noise among the people outside, the groaning, the cries!\r\n\r\n"Now, ma\'am!" said Morris, breathless with the haste she had made down\r\nstairs.  Morris supposed her mistress would softly let down the chain,\r\nopen the door just wide enough for Hope to slip in, and shut, bolt, and\r\nchain it again.  This was what Hester had intended; but her mood was\r\nchanged.  She bade the servants all step out of sight, and then threw\r\nthe door wide open, going forth herself upon the steps.  The people had\r\nclosed round Hope\'s horse; but Philip was pushing his in between the mob\r\nand their object, and riding round and round him with a sort of\r\nludicrous gravity, which lowered the tone of the whole affair to\r\nMargaret\'s mind, and gave her great relief.  Mr Rowland was shaking\r\nhands with Hope with one hand, and holding the bridle of the uneasy\r\nhorse with the other.  Hope himself was bespattered with mud from head\r\nto foot, and his umbrella was broken to pieces.  He nodded cheerfully to\r\nHester when she threw open the door.  When she held out her hand to him\r\nwith a smile as he ascended the steps, the noise of the crowd was\r\nsuddenly hushed.  They understood rather more of what they saw than of\r\nanything that could be said to them.  They allowed Charles to come out,\r\nand lead the horse away round the corner to the stable.  They stood\r\nstock-still, gaping and staring, while Hope invited Mr Rowland in, and\r\nMr Rowland declined entering; while that gentleman shook hands with the\r\nladies, spoke with Mr Enderby, mounted Mr Enderby\'s horse, and rode\r\noff.  They saw Philip turn slowly into the house with the family party,\r\nand the door closed, before they thought of giving another groan.\r\n\r\n"Well, love!" said Hester, looking anxiously at her husband.\r\n\r\n"You made good battle," said Philip.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I had a pretty hard fight of it, from the toll-bar hither," said\r\nHope, stretching vigorously.  "They wrenched my whip out of my hand--\r\nfive hands to one; but then I had my umbrella.  I broke it to pieces\r\nwith rapping their knuckles."\r\n\r\n"Which are as hard as their pates," observed Philip.  "What are we to do\r\nnext?"\r\n\r\n"If they do not disperse presently, I will go and speak to them; but I\r\ndare say they have had enough of the show for to-day: Mrs Plumstead\r\nmust have satisfied them with oratory.  That poor woman\'s face and voice\r\nwill haunt me when I have forgotten all the rest.  One had almost rather\r\nhave her against one, than that such screaming should be on one\'s\r\nbehalf.  Now, my love, how has the morning gone with you?"\r\n\r\n"Very pleasantly, I would answer for it from her looks," said Philip.\r\nAnd Hester\'s face was certainly full of the beauty of happiness.\r\n\r\n"Thank God, the morning is over!  That is all I have to say about it,"\r\nreplied she.\r\n\r\n"Surely those people outside are growing more noisy!" observed Margaret.\r\n\r\n"I must change my clothes, in case of its being necessary to speak to\r\nthem," said Hope.  "I look too like a victim at present."\r\n\r\nWhile he and Hester were out of the room, Philip told Margaret how her\r\nbrother had been treated at the almshouses.  He had narrowly escaped\r\nbeing pulled from his horse and thrown into the pond.  He had been\r\nfollowed half-way to Deerbrook by a crowd, throwing stones and\r\nshrieking; and just when he had got beyond their reach, he had met\r\nPhilip, and learned that he had the same thing to go through, at the\r\nother extremity of his journey.  Finding that both his doors were\r\nsurrounded, he had judged it best to make for the front, coming home as\r\nnearly as possible in his usual manner.  He had kept his temper\r\nadmirably, joking with his detainers, while dealing his blows upon their\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n"Where will all this end?" cried Margaret.\r\n\r\n"With some going to dinner, and others to supper, I imagine," replied\r\nPhilip, stepping to the window.  "From what I see, that seems likely to\r\nbe the upshot; for here is Sir William Hunter talking to the people.  I\r\nhad rather he should do it than Hope; and, Margaret, I had rather set my\r\nmischievous sister to do it than either.  This uproar is all of her\r\nmaking, I am afraid."\r\n\r\n"Hester has been telling Mr Rowland so, this morning."\r\n\r\n"I am glad of it.  He must help me to work upon her fears, if there is\r\nnothing better left to operate upon."\r\n\r\n"You will not succeed," said Margaret.  "Your sister is as strong a\r\nheroine in one direction as mine is in another."\r\n\r\n"She shall yield, however.  She may be thankful that she is not here\r\nto-day.  If she was, I would have her out upon the steps, and make her\r\nretract everything; and if she should not be able to speak, I would\r\nstand by her and say it for her."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Philip! what a horrible idea!"\r\n\r\n"Not half so horrible as the mischief she has done.  Why, Margaret, if\r\nyou were one-tenth part as guilty as Priscilla is, I should require you\r\nto make reparation."\r\n\r\n"Indeed, I hope you would: or rather, that--"\r\n\r\n"But do not let us conjure up such dreadful images, my Margaret.  You\r\nnever wronged any one, and you never will."\r\n\r\n"Edward never did, I am sure," said Margaret.\r\n\r\n"Not even by poisoning children, nor cutting off limbs for sport?  Are\r\nyou quite sure, love?  What is Sir William doing here, with only his\r\ngroom?  He and the people look in high good-humour with each other, with\r\nall this shaking of hands, and nodding and laughing.  I cannot conceive\r\nwhat he can be saying to them, for there are not three faces among the\r\nwhole array that look as if they belonged to rational creatures."\r\n\r\n"Never mind," said Margaret.  "If what he says sends them away, I care\r\nfor nothing else about it."\r\n\r\n"Oh, but I do.  One would like to be favoured with a specimen of this\r\nkind of rural oratory.  I ought to benefit by all the oratory that comes\r\nin my way, you know: so I shall just open the window an inch or two, now\r\nhe is drawing hitherward, and take a lesson."\r\n\r\nIt seemed as if Sir William Hunter desired that his powers of persuasion\r\nshould be expended on none but the immediate objects of them: for\r\nwhatever he said was spoken as he bent from his horse, and with the air\r\nof a mystery.  Many a plump red face was thrust close up to his--many a\r\npair of round staring eyes was puckered up with mirth as he spoke: the\r\nteamster in his olive-coloured smock, the hedger in his shirt-sleeves,\r\nand the little bumpkins who had snatched a holiday from scaring the\r\ncrows, all seemed, by their delight, to be capable of entering into the\r\nbaronet\'s method of argumentation.  All this stimulated Philip\'s\r\ncuriosity to learn what the speechifying tended to.  He could catch only\r\na few words, and those were about "a new man,"--"teach him to take\r\nhimself off,"--"all bad things come to an end,"--"new state of things,\r\nsoon."  Philip was afraid there was treachery here.  Margaret had no\r\nother expectation from the man--the tyrannical politician, who bore a\r\ngrudge against a neighbour for having used his constitutional liberty\r\naccording to his conscience.\r\n\r\nSome spectacle now drew the attention of the crowd another way.  It was\r\nLady Hunter, in her chariot and greys, statelily pacing through the\r\nvillage.  She had heard that there was some commotion in Deerbrook; and,\r\nas sights are rare in the country, she thought she would venture to come\r\nto the village to shop, rather than wait for Sir William\'s account of\r\nthe affair in the evening, over their wine and oranges, and before he\r\ndropped off into his nap.  She rightly confided in the people, that they\r\nwould respect her chariot and greys, and allow her to pass amidst them\r\nin safety and honour.  She had never seen a person mobbed.  Here was a\r\ngood opportunity.  It was even possible that she might catch a glimpse\r\nof the ladies in their terrors.  At all events, she should be a great\r\nperson, and see and hear a great deal: so she would go.  Orders were\r\ngiven that she should be driven quickly up to the milestone beyond the\r\ntoll-bar, and then very slowly through Deerbrook to Mrs Howell\'s.  Her\r\nservants were prompt, for they, too, longed to see what was going\r\nforward; and thus they arrived, finding a nice little mob ready-made to\r\ntheir expectations, and no cause of regret but that they arrived too\r\nlate to see Mr Hope get home.  There were no ladies in terror within\r\nsight: but then there was the affecting spectacle of Sir William\'s\r\npopularity.  In full view of all the mob, Lady Hunter put a corner of\r\nher embroidered handkerchief to each eye, on witnessing the affection of\r\nhis neighbours to her husband, shown by the final shaking of hands which\r\nwas now gone through.  Sir William then rode slowly up to the\r\ncarriage-door, followed by his groom, who touched his hat.  Orders were\r\ngiven to drive on; and then Lady Hunter\'s servants touched their hats.\r\nThe carriage resumed its slow motion, and Sir William rode beside it,\r\nhis hand on the door, and his countenance solemn as if he was on the\r\nbench, instead of on horseback.  The great blessing of the arrangement\r\nwas that everybody followed.  Lady Hunter having come to see the mob,\r\nthe mob now, in return, went to see Lady Hunter: and while they were\r\ncherishing their mutual interest, the family in the corner-house were\r\nleft in peace to prosecute their dinners.  Philip threw up the window\r\nwhich looked into the garden, and then ran down to bring Margaret some\r\nflowers to refresh her senses after the hurry of the morning.  Margaret\r\nlet down the chain of the hall door; and Morris laid the cloth, as she\r\nhad sent Charles to sweep down the steps and pavement before the house,\r\nthat all things might wear as much as possible their usual appearance.\r\nHester ordered up a bottle of her husband\'s best ale, and the servants\r\nwent about with something of the air peculiar to a day of frolic.\r\n\r\n"Dear heart!  Lady Hunter!  Can it be your ladyship?" exclaimed Mrs\r\nHowell, venturing to show her face at the door of her darkened shop, and\r\nto make free entrance for her most exalted customer.\r\n\r\n"Good heavens! your ladyship!  Who would have thought of seeing your\r\nladyship here on such a day?" cried Miss Miskin.\r\n\r\n"Where\'s Bob, Miss Miskin?  Do, Miss Miskin, send Bob to take down the\r\nshutters:--that is, if your ladyship thinks that Sir William would\r\nrecommend it.  If Sir William thinks it safe,--that is my criterion."\r\n\r\n"I hope we are all safe, now, Mrs Howell," replied the lady.  "Sir\r\nWilliam\'s popularity is a most fortunate circumstance for us all, and\r\nfor the place at large."\r\n\r\n"Oh dear, your ladyship! what should we be, not to estimate Sir William?\r\nWe have our faults, like other people: but really, if we did not know\r\nhow to value Sir William--"\r\n\r\n"Thank Heaven!" said Miss Miskin, "we have not fallen so low as that.\r\nNow your ladyship can see a little of our goings on--now the shutters\r\nare down: but, dear heart! your ladyship would not have wondered at our\r\nputting them up.  I am sure I thought for my part, that that middle\r\nshutter never would have gone up.  It stuck, your ladyship--"\r\n\r\n"Oh!" cried Mrs Howell, putting her hands before her face, as if the\r\nrecollection was even now too much for her, "the middle shutter stuck--\r\nBob had got it awry, and jammed it between the other two, and there,\r\nnothing that Bob could do would move it!  And there we heard the noise\r\nat a distance--the cries, your ladyship--and the shutter would not go\r\nup!  And Miss Miskin ran out, and so did I--"\r\n\r\n"Did you really?  Well, I must say I admire your courage, Mrs Howell."\r\n\r\n"Oh, your ladyship, in a moment of desperation, you know...  If anybody\r\nhad seen Miss Miskin\'s face, I\'m sure, as she tugged at the shutter--it\r\nwas as red... really scarlet!"\r\n\r\n"And I\'m sure so was yours, Mrs Howell, downright crimson."\r\n\r\n"And after all," resumed Mrs Howell, "we should never have got the\r\nshutter up, if Mr Tucker had not had the politeness to come and help\r\nus.  But we are talking all this time, and perhaps your ladyship may be\r\nalmost fainting with the fright.  Would not your ladyship step into my\r\nparlour, and have a little drop of something?  Let me have the honour--a\r\nglass of mulled port wine, or a drop of cherry-bounce.  Miss Miskin--you\r\nwill oblige us--the cherry-bounce, you know."\r\n\r\nMiss Miskin received the keys from the girdle with a smile of readiness;\r\nbut Lady Hunter declined refreshment.  She explained that she felt more\r\ncollected than she might otherwise have done, from her not having been\r\ntaken by surprise.  She had been partly aware, before she left the Hall,\r\nof what she should have to encounter.\r\n\r\n"Dear heart! what courage!"\r\n\r\n"Goodness! how brave!"\r\n\r\n"I could not be satisfied to remain safe at the Hall, you know, when I\r\ndid not know what might be happening to Sir William; so I ordered the\r\ncarriage, and came.  It was a very anxious ride, I assure you, Mrs\r\nHowell.  But I found, when I got here, that I need not have been under\r\nany alarm for Sir William.  He has made himself so beloved, that I\r\nbelieve we have nothing to fear for him under any circumstances.  But\r\nwhat can we think, Mrs Howell, of those who try to create such danger?"\r\n\r\n"What, indeed, ma\'am!  Any one, I\'m sure, who would so much as dream of\r\nhurting a hair of Sir William\'s head...  As I said to Miss Miskin, when\r\nMr Tucker told us Sir William was come among them--`that\'s the\r\ncriterion,\' said I."\r\n\r\n"As it happens, Sir William is in no danger, I believe; but no thanks to\r\nthose who are at the bottom of this disturbance.  It is no merit of\r\ntheirs that Sir William is so popular."\r\n\r\n"No, indeed, your ladyship.  We may thank Heaven for that, not them.\r\nBut what _is_ to be done, your ladyship?  I declare it is not safe to go\r\non in this way.  It makes one think of being burnt in one\'s bed."  And\r\nall the three shuddered.\r\n\r\n"Sir William will take the right measures, you need not doubt, Mrs\r\nHowell.  Sir William looks forward--Sir William is very cautious,\r\nthough, from his intrepidity, some might doubt it.  The safety of\r\nDeerbrook may very well be left to Sir William."\r\n\r\n"No doubt, your ladyship, no doubt!  We should be really afraid to go to\r\nour beds, if we had not Sir William to rely on, as Miss Miskin said to\r\nme only this morning.  But, dear heart! what can Sir William, or an\r\nangel from heaven do, in some sorts of dangers?  If one might ask, for\r\none\'s confidential satisfaction, what does Sir William think of this\r\naffair of the church-door?"\r\n\r\nAmidst shrugs and sighs, Miss Miskin drew quite near, to hear the fate\r\nof Deerbrook revealed by Lady Hunter.  But Lady Hunter did not know the\r\nfacts about the church-door, on which the inquiry was based.  This only\r\nshowed how secret some people could be in their designs.  There was no\r\nsaying what Lady Hunter might think of it; it really seemed as if\r\nDeerbrook, that had had such a good character hitherto, was going to be\r\non a level with Popish places--a place of devastation and conflagration.\r\nLady Hunter looked excessively grave when she heard this; and, if\r\npossible, graver than ever, when she was told that not only had a\r\nlantern been found in the churchyard with a bit of candle left in the\r\nsocket, but that a piece of charred stick, full three inches long, had\r\nbeen picked up close by the church-door.  After hearing this, Lady\r\nHunter would not commit herself any further.  She asked for some\r\nhair-pins, with a dignified and melancholy air.  While she was selecting\r\nthe article, she let Mrs Howell talk on about the lantern and the\r\nstick--that no one wondered about the lantern, knowing what practices\r\nwent on in the churchyard when quiet people were asleep; but that the\r\ncharred stick was too alarming: only that, to be sure, anybody might be\r\naware that those who would go into churchyards for one bad purpose would\r\nbe ready enough for another; and that Heaven only knew how long the\r\nchurches of the land would be safe while Lowrys were sent to Parliament,\r\nand those that sent them there were all abroad.  Lady Hunter sighed\r\nemphatically, whispered her desire that the hair-pins should be set down\r\nin her account, and went away, amidst deep and mournful curtseys from\r\nthose whom she left behind.\r\n\r\nUnder certain circumstances, the mind becomes so rapidly possessed of an\r\nidea, is enabled to assimilate it so completely and speedily, that the\r\npossessor becomes unaware how very recently the notion was received, and\r\ndeals with it as an old-established thought.  This must be Lady Hunter\'s\r\nexcuse (for no other can be found) for speaking of the plot for burning\r\nDeerbrook church as one of the signs of the times which had alarmed Sir\r\nWilliam and herself of late.  She had so digested Mrs Howell\'s fact by\r\nthe time she had reached Mr Tucker\'s shop, that she thus represented\r\nthe case of the charred stick to Mr Tucker without any immediate sting\r\nof conscience for telling a lie.  She felt rather uncomfortable when Mr\r\nJones, the butcher, who had stepped in at Tucker\'s to discuss the event\r\nof the morning, observed, with deference, but with much decision, that\r\nhe was sorry to hear Sir William was made uneasy by the circumstance of\r\nthe charred stick having been found, as it seemed to him a very simple\r\nmatter to account for.  Several of the boys of the village--his own son\r\nJohn for one--had lately taken to the old sport of whirling round a\r\nlighted stick at the end of a string, to make a circle of fire in the\r\ndark.  Sometimes it happened that a spark caught the string; and then\r\nthe stick was apt to fly off, nobody knew where.  It was an unsafe\r\nsport, certainly; and as such he had forbidden it to his son John: but\r\nthere was no doubt in his mind (without defending the sport), that the\r\nstick in question had jerked itself over the churchyard wall, and had\r\nnot been put there by anybody;--to say nothing of its having lain so far\r\nfrom the door (and in the grass, too), that it was difficult to see what\r\ncould be expected to catch fire from it.  Jones took up his hat from the\r\ncounter, saying, that as Sir William was close at hand, he would step\r\nand tell him what he thought would ease his mind about this affair.\r\nThis movement laid open to Lady Hunter\'s mind the enormity of her fib:\r\nand remembering that, as far as she knew, her husband had never heard of\r\nthe charred stick, she vigorously interfered to keep Mr Jones where he\r\nwas, averring that Sir William had rather hear the explanation from her\r\nthan from any person actually resident in Deerbrook.  He had his\r\nreasons, and she must insist.  Mr Jones bowed; her alarm ceased, and\r\nher compunction gradually died away.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr Tucker had received his orders about the fire-guard (which\r\noccasioned his whispering that there had never been so much need in\r\nDeerbrook of guards against fire as now), Lady Hunter\'s footman came\r\ninto the shop to say that his master was in the carriage.  Sir William\r\nhad sent his horse home, and would return in the chariot with his lady.\r\nShe hastened away, to prevent any chat between Sir William and Mr\r\nJones.  But, once in the carriage, in all the glory of being surrounded\r\nand watched by a number of gaping clowns and shouting boys, she could\r\nnot resolve to bury herself in the seclusion of the Hall, without\r\nenjoying the bustle a little longer.  She therefore suddenly discovered\r\nthat she wanted to order a morning cap at Miss Nares\'; and the carriage\r\ndrew up in state before the milliner\'s door.  Miss Flint, whose hair had\r\ncome out of curl, from her having leaned out of an upper window to watch\r\nthe commotion, now flew to the glass to pull off her curl-papers; Miss\r\nNares herself hastily drew out of drawers and cupboards the smart things\r\nwhich had been huddled away under the alarm about the sacking of\r\nDeerbrook; and then threw a silk handkerchief over the tray, on which\r\nstood the elder wine and toast with which she and her assistant had been\r\ncomforting themselves after the panic of the morning.  All the caps were\r\ntried on with mysterious melancholy, but with some haste.  Sir William\r\nmust not be kept long waiting: in times like these, a magistrate\'s\r\nmoments were valuable.  Sir William was reading the newspaper, in order\r\nto convey the impression that he considered the affair of this morning a\r\ntrifling one; but--\r\n\r\n"These are strange times, Miss Nares."\r\n\r\n"Very alarming, my lady.  I am sure I don\'t know when we shall recover\r\nfrom the fright.  And no further back than six weeks, I had that person\r\nin, my lady, to attend Miss Flint in a sore throat.  So little were we\r\naware!"\r\n\r\n"I am thankful enough it was not for a broken arm," observed Miss Flint,\r\nin accents of devout gratitude.\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed, my dear," observed Miss Nares, "it would have ruined all\r\nyour prospects in life if he had done by you as he did by the Russell\r\nTaylors\' nursemaid.  Have you never heard that, my lady?  Well!  I am\r\nastonished!  I find the story is in everybody\'s mouth.  Mrs Russell\r\nTaylor\'s nursemaid was crossing the court, with the baby in her arms,\r\nwhen she tripped over the string of Master Hampden Taylor\'s kite.  Well,\r\nmy lady, she fell; and her first thought, you know, was to save the\r\nbaby; so she let all her weight go on the other arm--the right--and, as\r\nyou may suppose, broke it.  It snapped below the elbow.  The gentleman\r\nin the corner-house was sent for immediately, to set it.  Now they say\r\n(you, my lady, know all about it, of course,) that there are two bones\r\nin that part of one\'s arm, below the elbow."\r\n\r\n"There are so.  Quite correct.  There are two bones."\r\n\r\n"Well, my lady, all the story depends upon that.  The gentleman in\r\nquestion did set the bones; but he set them across, you see,--as it\r\nmight be so."  And Miss Nares arranged four pieces of whalebone on the\r\ntable in the shape of a long, narrow letter X; there could not have been\r\na better exemplification.  "The consequence was, my lady, that the poor\r\ngirl\'s hand was found, when she had got well, to be turned completely\r\nround: and, in fact, it is all but useless."\r\n\r\n"When her hands are in her lap," observed Miss Flint, "the palm of the\r\nright lies uppermost.  Ugh!"\r\n\r\n"When she beckons the children with that hand," observed Miss Nares,\r\n"they think she means them to go further off.  A girl who has to earn\r\nher bread, my lady!  It is in everybody\'s mouth, I assure you."\r\n\r\n"What has become of the girl?" asked Lady Hunter.\r\n\r\n"Oh, she was got rid of--sent away--to save the credit of the gentleman\r\nin the corner-house.  But these things will come out, my lady.  You are\r\naware that the Russell Taylors have for some time been employing Mr\r\nFoster, from Blickley?"\r\n\r\n"Ah, true!  I had heard of that."\r\n\r\nWith unrelaxed gravity, Lady Hunter returned to her equipage, carrying\r\nwith her Miss Nares\'s newest cap and story.\r\n\r\nAs the carriage drew near the corner-house, the driver, as if\r\nsympathising with his lady\'s thoughts, made his horses go their very\r\nslowest.  Lady Hunter raised herself, and leaned forward, that she might\r\nsee what she could see in this dangerous abode.  The spring evening\r\nsunshine was streaming in at the garden window at the back of the house;\r\nso that the party in the room was perfectly visible, in the thorough\r\nlight, to any one who could surmount the obstacle of the blind.  Lady\r\nHunter saw four people sitting at dinner, and somebody was waiting on\r\nthem.  She could scarcely have told what it was that surprised her; but\r\nshe exclaimed to Sir William--\r\n\r\n"Good heavens! they are at dinner!"\r\n\r\nSir William called out angrily to the coachman to drive faster, and\r\nasked whether he meant to keep everybody out till midnight.\r\n\r\nThe Hopes were far less moved by seeing the baronet and his lady driving\r\nby, than the baronet and his lady were by seeing the Hopes dining.  They\r\nhad not the slightest objection to the great folks from the Hall\r\nderiving all the excitement and amusement they could from an airing\r\nthrough the village; and they were happily ignorant of the most\r\natrocious stories about Hope which were now circulating from mouth to\r\nmouth, all round Deerbrook.\r\n\r\nIt was not long, however, before they found that they had been indebted\r\nto the great folks from the Hall for a certain degree of protection,\r\npartly from the equipage having drawn off the attention of some of the\r\nidlers, and partly from the people having been unwilling to indulge all\r\ntheir anger and impertinence in the presence of a magistrate.  Scarcely\r\nhalf an hour had elapsed after the sound of the carriage wheels had died\r\naway, before a face was seen surmounting the blind of the windows\r\ntowards the street.  Presently another appeared, and another.  Men below\r\nwere hoisting up boys, to make grimaces at the family, and see what was\r\ngoing on.  The shutters were closed rather earlier than usual.  Philip\r\nwent out to make a survey.  He and Mr Grey soon returned, to advise\r\nthat the ladies should quit the house, and that a guard should enter it.\r\nThe first proposition was refused; the second accepted.  Mr Grey\r\ncarried off all the money and small valuables.  Hester and Margaret\r\nbestirred themselves to provide refreshments for Messrs. Grey and\r\nRowland\'s men, who were to be ready to act in their defence.  They\r\nscarcely knew what to expect; but they resolved to remain where Edward\r\nwas, and to fear nothing from which he did not shrink.\r\n\r\nThere was much noise round the house--a multitude of feet and of voices.\r\nMessengers were sent off to the Hall and to Dr Levitt, who must now be\r\ndisturbed, whatever might become of his sermon.  Philip brought in Mr\r\nRowland\'s men, and declared he should not leave the premises again if\r\nthe ladies would not be persuaded to go.  He took up his station in the\r\nhall, whence he thought he could learn most of what it was that the\r\npeople had intended to do, and be most ready to act as occasion might\r\nrequire.  No one could imagine what was designed, or whether there was\r\nany design at all on foot.  The only fact at present apparent was, that\r\nthe crowd was every moment increasing.\r\n\r\nHester was stooping over the cellaret in the room where they had dined,\r\nwhen a tremendous crash startled her, and a stone struck down the light\r\nwhich stood beside her, leaving her in total darkness.  Philip came to\r\nher in a moment.  No one had thought of closing the shutters of the back\r\nwindows; and now the garden was full of people.  The house was besieged\r\nback and front; and, in ten minutes from the entrance of this first\r\nstone, not a pane of glass was left unbroken in any of the lower\r\nwindows.  Hope ran out, his spirit thoroughly roused by these insults;\r\nand he was the first to seize and detain one of the offenders; but the\r\nfeat was rather too dangerous to bear repetition.  He was recognised,\r\nsurrounded, and had some heavy blows inflicted upon him.  He succeeded\r\nin bringing off his man; but it was by the help of a sally of his\r\nfriends from the house; and having locked up his prisoner in his\r\ndressing-room, he found it best to await the arrival of a magistrate\r\nbefore he went forth again.\r\n\r\nThe surgery was the most open to attack; and this being the place where\r\nthe people expected to find the greatest number of dead bodies, their\r\nenergies were directed towards the professional part of the premises.\r\nThe pupil took flight, and left the intruders to work their pleasure.\r\nThey found no bodies, and were angry accordingly.  When the crashing of\r\nall the glass was over, the shelves and cases were torn down, and, with\r\nthe table and chairs, carried out into the street, and cast into a heap.\r\nOther wood was brought; and it was owing to the pertinacity of the mob\r\nin front of the house, in attacking the shutters, that the rioters met\r\nwith no opposition in the surgery.  Hope, Enderby, and their assistants,\r\nhad more on their hands than they could well manage, in beating off the\r\nassailants in front.  If the shutters were destroyed, the whole\r\nfurniture of the house would go, and no protection would remain to\r\nanybody in it.  The surgery must be left to take its chance, rather than\r\nthis barrier between the women and the mob be thrown down.  Whatever\r\noffensive warfare was offered from the house was from the servants, from\r\nthe upper window.  The women poured down a quick succession of pails of\r\nwater; and Charles returned, with good aim, such stones as had found\r\ntheir way in.  The gentlemen were little aware, for some time, that the\r\ncries of vexation or ridicule, which were uttered now and then, were\r\ncaused by the feats of their own coadjutors overhead: and it was in\r\nconsequence of seeing Hester and Margaret laughing in the midst of their\r\npanic that the fact became known to them.\r\n\r\nSoon after, a bright light was visible between the crevices of the\r\nshutters, and a prodigious shout arose outside.  The bonfire was\r\nkindled.  Hester and Margaret went to the upper windows to see it; and\r\nwhen the attacks upon the shutters seemed to have ceased, Enderby joined\r\nthem.  There were very few faces among the crowd that were known even to\r\nCharles, whose business it was, in his own opinion, to know everybody.\r\nMr Tucker was evidently only looking on from a distance.  Mrs\r\nPlumstead had been on the spot, but was gone--terrified into quietness\r\nby the fire, into which the rioters had threatened to throw her, if she\r\ndisturbed their proceedings.  She had professed to despise the idea of a\r\nducking in the brook; but a scorching in the fire was not to be braved;\r\nso no more was heard of her this night.  Three or four of the\r\nfrequenters of the public-house were on the spot; but though they lent a\r\nhand to throw fresh loads of fuel on the fire, they did not take their\r\npipes from their mouths, nor seem to be prime movers in the riot.  The\r\nyellow blaze lighted up a hundred faces, scowling with anger or grinning\r\nwith mirth, but they were all strange--strange as the incidents of the\r\nday.  A little retired from the glare of the fire, was a figure,\r\nrevealed only when the flame shot up from being freshly fed--Sir William\r\nHunter on horseback with his immovable groom behind him.  How long he\r\nhad been there, nobody in the house could tell; nor whether he had\r\nattempted to do anything in behalf of peace and quiet.  There he sat, as\r\nif looking on for his amusement, and forgetting that he had any business\r\nwith the scene.\r\n\r\nIt was no wonder that Dr Levitt was not yet visible.  If he should\r\narrive by dawn, that was all that could be expected.  But where were Mr\r\nGrey and Sydney?  Where was Mr Rowland?  Like some of Mr Hope\'s other\r\nneighbours, who ought to have come to his aid on such an occasion, these\r\ngentlemen were detained at home by the emotions of their families.\r\nSydney Grey was locked up by his tender mother as securely as Mr Hope\'s\r\nprisoner; and all the boy\'s efforts to break the door availed only to\r\nbruise him full as seriously as the mob would have done.  His father was\r\ndetained by the tremors of his wife, the palpitations of Sophia, and the\r\ntears and sobs of the twins, all of which began with the certainty of\r\nthe first stone having been thrown, and were by no means abated by the\r\nsight of the reflection of the flames on the sky.  Mr Grey found it\r\nreally impossible to leave his family, as he afterwards said.  He\r\nconsoled himself with the thought that he had done the best he could, by\r\nsending his men.  These things were exactly what his partner said.  He,\r\ntoo, had done the best he could, in sending his men.  He, too, found it\r\nimpossible to leave his family.  In the dusk of the evening, when the\r\nfirst stones had begun to fly, the carriage which was heard, in the\r\nintervals of the crashes, to roll by, contained Mrs Rowland and her\r\nchildren, and some one else.  It may easily be imagined that it was made\r\nimpossible to Mr Rowland to leave his family, to go to the assistance\r\nof the people in the corner-house.\r\n\r\nA fresh shout soon announced some new device.  A kind of procession\r\nappeared to be advancing up the street, and some notes of rude music\r\nwere heard.  A party was bringing an effigy of Mr Hope to burn on the\r\npile.  There was the odious thing--plain enough in the light of the\r\nfire--with the halter round its neck, a knife in the right hand, and a\r\nphial--a real phial out of Hope\'s own surgery, in the left!\r\n\r\n"This is too bad to be borne," cried Enderby; while Hope, who had come\r\nup to see what others were seeing, laughed heartily at the\r\nrepresentative of himself.  "This is not to be endured.  Morris, quick!\r\nFetch me half a dozen candles!"\r\n\r\n"Candles, sir?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, candles.  I will put this rabble to flight.  I wish I had thought\r\nof it before."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Philip!" said Margaret, apprehensively.\r\n\r\n"Fear nothing, Margaret.  I am going to do something most eminently\r\nsafe, as you will see."\r\n\r\nHe would not let any one go with him but Charles and Morris.  It was\r\nsome minutes before any effect from his absence was perceived; but, at\r\nlength, just when the effigy had been sufficiently insulted, and was\r\nabout to be cast into the flames, and Hester had begged her husband not\r\nto laugh at it any more, a roar of anguish and terror was heard from the\r\ncrowd, which began to disperse in all directions.  The ladies ventured\r\nto lean out of the window, to see what was the cause of the uproar.\r\nThey understood it in a moment.  Mr Enderby had possessed himself of\r\nthe skeleton which hung in the mahogany case in the waiting-room, had\r\nlighted it up behind the eyes and the ribs, and was carrying it aloft\r\nbefore him, approaching round the corner, and thus confronting the\r\neffigy.  The spectre moved steadily on, while the people fled.  It made\r\nstraight for Sir William Hunter, who now seemed for the first time\r\ndisposed to shift his place.  He did so with as much slowness and\r\ndignity as were compatible with the urgency of the circumstances, edging\r\nhis horse further and further into the shade.  When he found, however,\r\nthat the spectre continued to light its own path towards him, there was\r\nsomething rather piteous in the tone of his appeal:--"I am Sir William\r\nHunter!  I am--I am Sir William Hunter!"  The spectre disregarding even\r\nthis information, there was nothing for the baronet to do but to gallop\r\noff--his groom for once in advance of him.  When they were out of sight,\r\nthe spectre turned sharp round, and encountered Dr Levitt, who was now\r\narriving just when every one else was departing.  He started, as might\r\nhave been expected, spoke angrily to the "idle boy" whom he supposed to\r\nbe behind the case of bones, and laughed heartily when he learned who\r\nwas the perpetrator, and what the purpose of the joke.  He entered\r\nHope\'s house, to learn the particulars of the outrage, and order off the\r\nprisoner into confinement elsewhere, his ideas being too extensively\r\ndiscomposed to admit of any more sermon-writing this night.  Charles had\r\nalready captured the effigy, and set it up in the hall: a few more\r\npailsful of water extinguished the fire in the street; and in a quarter\r\nof an hour the neighbourhood seemed to be as quiet as usual.\r\n\r\n"Where are you to sleep after all this fatigue?" said Hope to his wife\r\nand sister, when Dr Levitt and Philip were gone, and the men were at\r\ntheir supper below.  "I do not believe they have left you a room which\r\nis not open to the night air.  What a strange home to have put you in!\r\nWho would have thought it a year ago?"\r\n\r\nHester smiled, and said she was never less sleepy.  Morris believed that\r\nnot a pane of glass was broken in the attics, and her ladies could sleep\r\nthere, if they preferred remaining at home to stepping to Mr Grey\'s.\r\nThey much preferred remaining where they were: and, on examination, it\r\nwas found that Margaret\'s room was also entire.  Hope proposed to take\r\npossession of Charles\'s attic, for once; and Charles enjoyed the novelty\r\nof having a mattress laid down for him in a corner of the upper landing.\r\nMorris tempted the ladies and her master to refresh themselves with\r\ntea.  She piled up the fire to a Christmas height, to compensate for the\r\ndraughts which blew in from the broken windows.  Hope soon grew\r\ndiscontented with her plan.\r\n\r\n"This will never do," said he, shivering.  "You will all be ill: and\r\nnobody must be ill now, for I have no medicines left."\r\n\r\nMorris murmured a wish that the physic had been forced down the people\'s\r\nthroats.\r\n\r\n"It is better where it is, Morris," said her master; "and we will\r\nforgive these poor people; shall we not?  They are lamentably ignorant,\r\nyou see."\r\n\r\nMorris thought forgiveness was always pretty sure to come in time but it\r\nwas not very easy at the moment.  She thought she could get over their\r\nrobbing her master of any amount of property; but she could not excuse\r\ntheir making him ridiculous before his lady\'s own eyes.\r\n\r\n"They cannot make him ridiculous, Morris," said Hester, cheerfully.\r\n\r\n"People who are persecuted are considered great, you know, Morris," said\r\nMargaret.\r\n\r\n"Bravo, ladies!" cried Hope.  "You keep up your own spirits, and my\r\ncomplacency, bravely.  But seriously, Morris," he continued, perceiving\r\nthat the vulgarity of the present affliction weighed down the good\r\nwoman\'s heart; "is it not true that few of our trials--none of those\r\nwhich are most truly trials--seem dignified at the time?  If they did,\r\npatience would be easier than it is.  The death of martyrs to their\r\nfaith is grand to look back upon; but it did not appear so to the best\r\nof the martyrs at the time.  This little trial of ours looks provoking,\r\nand foolish, and mean, to us to-night; but whether it really is so, will\r\ndepend on how we bear it; and whatever it may bring after it, grand or\r\nmean, all we have to do is to be good-humoured with it, Morris."\r\n\r\nMorris curtsied low.\r\n\r\n"And now, to your rooms," resumed Hope: "this place is growing too\r\nchilly for you, notwithstanding Morris\'s capital fire."\r\n\r\n"One thing more," said Margaret.  "I am a little uneasy about Maria.\r\nHas any one thought of her?  She must be anxious about us."\r\n\r\n"I will go this moment," said Hope.  "Nay, my love, it is early yet; no\r\none in Deerbrook is gone to rest yet, but the children.  I can be back\r\nin ten minutes, and the street is empty."\r\n\r\n"Let him go," said Margaret.  "It will be a great kindness; and surely\r\nthere is no danger now."\r\n\r\nHope was gone.  He did not come back in ten minutes, nor in half an\r\nhour.  Even Margaret heartily repented having urged him to leave home.\r\nDuring his absence she thus repented, but no longer when he returned.\r\nHe brought news which made her hasten to dress herself for the open air,\r\nwhen she was quite ready to retire to rest.  It was well that her\r\nbrother had gone.  Maria had been thrown down by the crowd, which had\r\novertaken her as she was walking homewards, and she had broken her leg.\r\nThe limb was set, the case was a simple and promising one; but she was\r\nin pain, and Margaret must go and pass the night with her.  How thankful\r\nwere they all now, that some one had thought of Maria!  She had been in\r\nextreme anxiety for them; and she would not certainly have sent for aid\r\nbefore the morning.  It was indeed a blessing that some one had thought\r\nof Maria.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY NINE.\r\n\r\nCOMING TO AN UNDERSTANDING.\r\n\r\nMr Enderby was too angry with his sister to see her that night.  He\r\nwent straight to his room, at his mother\'s old house, and did not\r\nbreakfast with the Rowlands.  He knocked at their door when breakfast\r\nwas finished, and sent to request Mrs Rowland\'s presence in the\r\ndrawing-room.  All this had given the lady time to prepare her mood, and\r\nsome very clever and bold sayings but when the interview was over, she\r\nwas surprised to find how some of these sayings had gone out of her\r\nmind, and how others had remained there, for want of opportunity to\r\nspeak them; so that she had not made nearly so good a figure as she had\r\nintended.\r\n\r\nThere was all due politeness in Enderby\'s way of inducing his sister to\r\nsit down, and of asking after the health of herself and her children.\r\n\r\n"We are all wonderfully improved, thank you, brother.  Indeed I have\r\nhopes that we shall all enjoy better health henceforward than we have\r\never known.  Mr Walcot\'s care will be new life to us."\r\n\r\n"Whose care?"\r\n\r\n"Mr Walcot\'s.  We brought him with us last night; and he is to go at\r\nonce into my mother\'s house.  He is a surgeon of the first degree of\r\neminence.  I think myself extremely fortunate in having secured him.\r\nThe chief reason, however, of my inviting him here was, that my poor\r\nmother might be properly taken care of.  Now I shall be at peace on her\r\naccount, which I really never was before.  Now that she will be in good\r\nhands, I shall feel that I have done my duty."\r\n\r\n"And, pray, does Rowland know of your having brought this stranger\r\nhere?"\r\n\r\n"Of course.  Mr Walcot is our guest till his own house can be prepared\r\nfor him.  As I tell you, he arrived with me, last night."\r\n\r\n"And now let me tell you, sister, that either Mr Walcot is not a man of\r\nhonour, or you have misinformed him of the true state of affairs here: I\r\nsuspect the latter to be the case.  It is of a piece with the whole of\r\nyour conduct, towards Mr Hope--conduct unpardonable for its\r\nuntruthfulness, and hateful for its malice."\r\n\r\nNot one of Mrs Rowland\'s prepared answers would suit in this place.\r\nBefore she could think of anything to say, Enderby proceeded:--\r\n\r\n"It is a dreadful thing for a brother to have to speak to a sister as I\r\nnow speak to you; but it is your own doing.  Mr Hope must have justice,\r\nand you have no one to blame but yourself that justice must be done at\r\nyour expense.  I give you fair notice that I shall discharge my duty\r\nfully, in the painful circumstances in which you have contrived to place\r\nall your family."\r\n\r\n"Do what you will, Philip.  My first duty is to take care of the health\r\nof my parent and my children; and if, by the same means, Deerbrook is\r\nprovided with a medical man worthy of its confidence, all Deerbrook will\r\nthank me."\r\n\r\n"Ignorant and stupid as Deerbrook is about many things, Priscilla, it is\r\nnot so wicked as to thank any one for waging a cowardly war against the\r\ngood, for disparaging the able and accomplished, and fabricating and\r\ncirculating injurious stories against people too magnanimous for the\r\nslanderer to understand."\r\n\r\n"I do not know what you mean, Philip."\r\n\r\n"I mean that you have done all this towards the Hopes.  You do not know\r\nthat he and his wife are not happy.  You know that Hope is an able and\r\nmost humane man in his profession, and that he does not steal dead\r\nbodies.  You know the falsehood of the whole set of vulgar stories that\r\nyou have put into circulation against him.  You know, also, that my\r\nmother has entire confidence in him, and that it will go near to break\r\nher heart to have him dismissed for any one else.  This is the meaning\r\nof what I say.  As for what I mean to do--it is this.  I shall speak to\r\nMr Walcot at once, before his intention to settle here is known."\r\n\r\n"You are too late, my dear sir.  Every one in Deerbrook knows it as well\r\nas if Dr Levitt was to give notice of it from the pulpit to-day."\r\n\r\n"So much the worse for you, Priscilla.  I shall explain the whole of\r\nHope\'s case to Mr Walcot, avoiding, if possible, all exposure of\r\nyou--."\r\n\r\n"Oh, pray do not disturb yourself about that.  Mr Walcot knows me very\r\nwell.  I am not afraid."\r\n\r\n"Avoiding, if possible, all exposure of you," resumed Enderby, "but not\r\nshrinking from the full statement of the facts, if that should prove\r\nnecessary to Hope\'s justification.  If this gentleman be honourable, he\r\nwill decline attending my mother, and go away more willingly than he\r\ncame.  I shall bear testimony to my friend with equal freedom everywhere\r\nelse; and I will never rest till the wrongs you have done him are\r\nrepaired--as far as reparation is possible."\r\n\r\n"You take the tone of defiance, I see, Philip.  I have not the slightest\r\nobjection.  We defy each other, then."\r\n\r\n"I cannot but take that tone for a purpose which, I conceive, is the\r\nkindest which, under the circumstances, can be entertained towards you,\r\nsister.  I do it in the hope that, before it is too late, you will\r\nyourself do the justice which I vow shall be done.  I give you\r\nperemptory warning, leaving you opportunity to retrieve yourself, to\r\nrepair the mischief you have done, and to alleviate the misery which I\r\nsee is coming upon you."\r\n\r\n"You are very good: but I know what I am about, and I shall proceed in\r\nmy own way.  I mean to get rid of these Hopes; and, perhaps, you may be\r\nsurprised to see how soon I succeed."\r\n\r\n"The Hopes shall remain as long as they wish to stay, if truth can\r\nprevail against falsehood.  I am sorry for you, if you cannot endure the\r\npresence of neighbours whose whole minds and conduct are noble and\r\nhumane, and known by you to be so.  This desire to get rid of them is a\r\nbad symptom, Priscilla--a symptom of a malady which neither Hope nor Mr\r\nWalcot, nor any one but yourself, can cure.  I would have you look to\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"Is your sermon ended?  It is time I was getting ready to hear Dr\r\nLevitt\'s."\r\n\r\n"What I have to say is not finished.  I desire to know what you mean by\r\ntelling everybody that I am engaged to Miss Mary Bruce."\r\n\r\n"I said so, because it is true."\r\n\r\nThe cool assurance with which she said this was too much for Enderby\'s\r\ngravity.  He burst out a-laughing.\r\n\r\n"If not precisely true when I said it, it was sure to be so soon; which\r\nis just the same thing.  I mean that it shall be true.  I have set my\r\nheart upon your marrying, and upon your marrying Mary Bruce.  I know she\r\nwould like it, and--"\r\n\r\n"Stop there!  Not another word about Miss Bruce!  I will not have you\r\ntake liberties with her name to me; and this is not the first time I\r\nhave told you so.  It is not true that she would like it--no more true\r\nthan many other things that you have said: and if you were to repeat it\r\ntill night, it would make no sort of impression upon me.  Miss Bruce\r\nknows little, and cares less, about me; and beware how you say to the\r\ncontrary!--And now for the plain fact.  I am engaged elsewhere."\r\n\r\n"No; you are not."\r\n\r\n"Yes; I am."\r\n\r\n"You will marry no one but Mary Bruce at last, you will see, whatever\r\nyou may think now."\r\n\r\n"For Heaven\'s sake, Priscilla, if you have any of the regard you profess\r\nto have for Miss Bruce, treat her name with some respect!--I am accepted\r\nby Margaret Ibbotson!"\r\n\r\n"I dare say you are?  Margaret Ibbotson!  So this is at the bottom of\r\nall your energy about the Hopes!"\r\n\r\n"I admired Hope before I ever saw Margaret, with sufficient energy to\r\nprompt me to anything I mean to do in his support.  But Margaret has\r\ncertainly exalted my feelings towards him, as she has towards everything\r\nmorally great and beautiful."\r\n\r\n"I hope you will all make yourselves happy with your greatness and your\r\nbeauty: for these friends of yours seem likely to have little else left\r\nto comfort themselves with."\r\n\r\n"They will be happy with their greatness and loveliness, sister; for it\r\nis Heaven\'s decree that they should.  Why will you not let yourself be\r\nhappy in witnessing it, Priscilla?  Why will you not throw off the\r\nrestraint of bad feelings, and do magnanimous justice to this family,\r\nand, having thus opened and freed your mind, glory in their goodness--\r\nthe next best thing to being as good as they?  You have power of mind to\r\ndo this: the very force with which you persist in persecuting them shows\r\nthat you have power for better things.  Believe me, they are full of the\r\nspirit of forgiveness.  Do but try--"\r\n\r\n"Thank you.  I am glad you are aware of my power.  If they forgive me\r\nfor anything, it shall be for my power."\r\n\r\n"That is not for you to determine, happily.  To what extent they forgive\r\nis between God and themselves.  You lie under their forgiveness, whether\r\nyou will or not.  I own, Priscilla, I would fain bestow on Margaret a\r\nsister whom she might respect rather than forgive."\r\n\r\n"Pray how many persons have you persuaded that Margaret Ibbotson is to\r\nbe my sister-in-law?"\r\n\r\n"Very few; for your sake, scarcely any.  We have been willing to allow\r\nyou your own time and methods for extricating yourself from the\r\ndifficulties you have made for yourself by your inconsiderate talk about\r\nMiss Bruce.  I own I cannot conceive how you could originate and carry\r\non such a device.  You must now get out of the scrape in your own way."\r\n\r\n"I am glad you have told so few people of your entanglement.  It makes\r\nit an easier matter to help you.  I shall deny the engagement\r\neverywhere."\r\n\r\n"That will hardly avail against my testimony."\r\n\r\n"It will, when you are gone.  The Deerbrook people always attend to the\r\nlast speaker.  Indeed, I think I have the majority with me now, as the\r\nevents of last night pretty plainly show."\r\n\r\n"Hope is not the first good man who has been slandered and suffered\r\nviolence.  Oh, Priscilla, I am unwilling to give you up!  Let me hope,\r\nthat the pride, the insane pride of this morning, is but the reaction of\r\nyour internal suffering from witnessing the results of your influence in\r\nthe outrages of last night.  Confide this to me now, and give yourself\r\nsuch ease as you yet can."\r\n\r\n"Thank you: but you are quite mistaken.  I was extremely glad to arrive\r\nwhen I did.  It satisfied me as to the necessity of getting rid of these\r\npeople; and it proved to Mr Walcot, as I observed to him at the time,\r\nhow much he was wanted here.  Now, if you have nothing more to say to\r\nme, I must go.  I shall deny your engagement everywhere."\r\n\r\nPhilip fixed his eyes upon her with an earnestness from which, for one\r\nmoment, she shrank; but she instantly rallied, and returned him a stare\r\nwhich lasted till she reached the door.\r\n\r\n"There is something almost sublime in audacity like this," thought he.\r\n"But it cannot last.  It comes from internal torture--a thing as\r\nnecessarily temporary as faith (the source of the other kind of\r\nstrength) is durable.  Not the slightest compunction has she for having\r\ncaused the misery she knows of: and not a whit would she relent, if she\r\ncould become aware (which she never shall) of what she made Margaret\r\nsuffer.  I fear my Margaret has still much to endure from her.  I will\r\nwatch and struggle to ward off from her every evil word and thought.\r\nThis is the only comfort under the misery of her being exposed to the\r\nmalice of any one belonging to me.  No; not the only comfort.  She does\r\nnot suffer from these things as she did.  She says she has a new\r\nstrength; and, thank God!  I believe it.  Now for Mr Walcot!  I must\r\ncatch him as he comes out of church, and see what I can make of him.  If\r\nhe is an honourable man, all may turn out well.  If not--Rowland and I\r\nmust see what can be done next."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY.\r\n\r\nCONDOLENCE.\r\n\r\nThe family in the corner-house thought this the strangest Sunday morning\r\nthey had ever looked upon.  Outside their premises, all was like a May\r\nsabbath.  The gardens sent up their fragrance into the warm, still air:\r\nthe cottage windows were open, and early roses and late hyacinths\r\nappeared within the casements.  The swallows were skimming and dipping\r\nabout the meadows; and the swans steered their majestic course along the\r\nriver, rippling its otherwise unbroken surface.  The men of the village\r\nsat on the thresholds of their doors, smoking an early pipe! and their\r\ntidy children, the boys with hair combed straight, and the girls with\r\nclean pinafores, came abroad; some to carry the Sunday dinner to the\r\nbaker\'s, and others to nurse the baby in the sunshine, or to snatch a\r\nbit of play behind a neighbour\'s dwelling.  The contrast within the\r\ncorner-house was strange.  Morris and the boy had been up early to\r\ngather the stones, and sweep up the fragments of glass from the floors,\r\nto put the effigy out of sight, and efface the marks of feet in the hall\r\nand parlours.  The supper had been cleared away in the kitchen, and the\r\nsmell of spirits and tobacco got rid of: but this was all that the most\r\nzealous servants could do.  The front shutters must remain closed, and\r\nthe garden windows empty of glass.  The garden itself was a mournful\r\nspectacle,--the pretty garden, which had been the pride and pleasure of\r\nthe family all this spring; part of the wall was thrown down; the ivy\r\ntrailed on the earth.  Of the shrubs, some were pulled up, and others\r\ncut off at the roots.  The beds were trodden into clay, and the grass,\r\nso green and sunny yesterday, was now trampled black where it was not\r\nhidden with fragments of the wood-work of the surgery, and with the\r\nrefuse of the broken glasses and spilled drugs.  Hope had also risen\r\nearly.  He had found his scared pupil returned, and wandering about the\r\nruins of his abode,--the surgery.  They set to work together, to put out\r\nof sight whatever was least seemly of the scattered contents of the\r\nprofessional apartment; but, with all their pains, the garden looked\r\nforlorn and disagreeable enough when Hester came down, shawled, to make\r\nbreakfast in the open air of the parlour, and her husband thought it\r\ntime to go and see how Maria had passed the night, and to bring Margaret\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nHester received from her husband and sister a favourable report of\r\nMaria.  She had slept, and Margaret had slept beside her.  Maria carried\r\nher philosophy into all the circumstances of her lot, and she had been\r\nlong used to pain and interruption of her plans.  These things, and the\r\nhurry of an accident in the street, might dismay one inexperienced in\r\nsuffering, but not her.  When not kept awake by actual pain, she slept;\r\nand when assured that her case was perfectly simple, and that there was\r\nevery probability of her being as well as usual in a few weeks, all her\r\nanxieties were for the Hopes.  No report of them could have satisfied\r\nher so well as Mr Hope\'s early visit,--as his serene countenance and\r\ncheerful voice.  She saw that he was not sad at heart; and warmly as she\r\nhonoured his temper, she could hardly understand this.  No wonder for\r\nshe did not know what his sufferings had previously been from other\r\ncauses, nor how vivid was his delight at the spirit in which Hester\r\nreceived their present misfortunes.  Margaret saw at once that all was\r\nwell at home, and made no inquiries about her sister.\r\n\r\n"Here is a letter for you, with a magnificent seal," said Hester, as\r\nthey entered.  "And here is tea as hot, I believe, as if we were still\r\nblessed with glass windows."\r\n\r\nThe letter had just been left by Sir William Hunter\'s groom.  It was\r\nfrom the Baronet, and its contents informed Mr Hope that his attendance\r\nwould not be required at the almshouses in future, as their inmates were\r\nplaced under the medical superintendence of Mr Walcot.\r\n\r\n"I am glad," said Hester.  "No more danger and insult from that\r\nquarter!"\r\n\r\n"Nor funds either, my dear.  It is pleasant enough to have no insult and\r\ndanger to apprehend; but what will you say to having no funds?"\r\n\r\n"We shall see when that time comes, love.  Meantime, here is breakfast,\r\nand the sweet Sunday all before us?"\r\n\r\nThe pressure of her hand by her husband effaced all woes, present and\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n"Who is Mr Walcot?" asked Margaret.\r\n\r\n"Somebody from Blickley, I suppose," said Hester.\r\n\r\n"No," replied Hope.  "Mr Walcot is a surgeon, last from Cheltenham, who\r\nsettled in Deerbrook at seven o\'clock yesterday evening, and who has\r\nalready swept the greater part of the practice of the place, I suspect.\r\nHe is, no doubt, the `better doctor,\' `the new man,\' of whom we have\r\nheard so much of late."\r\n\r\nHester changed colour, and Margaret too, while Hope related the arrival\r\nof Mrs Rowland and her party, as he had heard it from his pupil early\r\nthis morning.--What sort of man was Mr Walcot?  Time must show.  His\r\ncoming to settle in this manner, at such a conjuncture of circumstances,\r\ndid not look very well, Hope said; but it should be remembered that he\r\nmust necessarily be extremely prejudiced against the family in the\r\ncorner-house, if his information about Deerbrook was derived from Mrs\r\nRowland.  He ought not to be judged till he had had time and opportunity\r\nto learn for himself what was the real state of affairs in the place.\r\nHe must have fair play; and it was very possible that he might turn out\r\na man who would give others fair play.\r\n\r\nAt the next knock, Hester started, thereby showing that she was moved.\r\nMr Jones had called to know how the family were; and, after satisfying\r\nhimself on this point, had left a delicate sweetbread, with his\r\nrespects, and wishes that Mrs Hope might relish it after her fright.\r\nThis incident gave the little family more pleasure than Mr Walcot had\r\nyet caused them pain.  Here was sympathy,--the most acceptable offering\r\nthey could receive.\r\n\r\nNext came a message of inquiry from Dr and Mrs Levitt, with an\r\nintimation that they would call, if not inconvenient to the family,\r\nafter church.  This was pleasant too.\r\n\r\nWhile it was being agreed that a nurse must be found immediately for\r\nMaria, and that the glazier at Blickley must have notice to send people\r\nto mend the windows as early as possible to-morrow morning, a letter was\r\nbrought in, which looked longer, but less grand, than Sir William\r\nHunter\'s.  It was from Mr Rowland.\r\n\r\n  "(Private.)\r\n\r\n  "My Dear Sir, _Sunday Morning, 7 o\'clock_.\r\n\r\n  "During the greater part of an anxious night, my mind was full of the\r\n  intention of calling on you this morning, for some conversation on a\r\n  topic which must be discussed between us; but the more I dwell upon\r\n  what must be said, the more I shrink from an interview which cannot\r\n  but be extremely painful to each party; and I have at length come to\r\n  the conclusion that, for both our sakes, it is best to write what I\r\n  have to say.  It is painful enough, God knows, to write it!\r\n\r\n  "Your position here, my dear sir, must have been anything but pleasant\r\n  for some time past.  I regret that its uneasiness should have been\r\n  augmented, as I fear it has, by the influence of any one connected\r\n  with myself.  My respect for you has been as undeviating as it is\r\n  sincere; and I have not to reproach myself with having uttered a word\r\n  concerning you or your family which I should be unwilling to repeat to\r\n  yourselves: but I am aware that the same cannot be said, with regard\r\n  to every one for whom I am in a manner answerable.  In relation to\r\n  this unpleasant fact I can only say, that I entreat you to accept the\r\n  assurance of my deep regret and mortification.\r\n\r\n  "A new aspect of affairs has presented itself,--to me very suddenly,\r\n  as I trust you will believe, on my word of honour.  A gentleman of\r\n  your profession, named Walcot, arrived last night, with a view to\r\n  settling in Deerbrook.  The first inducement held out to him was the\r\n  medical charge of Mrs Enderby, and of the whole of my family: but, of\r\n  course, it is not probable that his expectations of practice among\r\n  your patients stop here; and the present unfortunate state of the\r\n  public mind of Deerbrook regarding yourself, makes it too probable\r\n  that his most sanguine expectations will be realised.  I write this\r\n  with extreme pain; but I owe it to you not to disguise the truth,\r\n  however distasteful may be its nature.\r\n\r\n  "These being the circumstances of the case, it appears to me hopeless\r\n  to press the departure of Mr Walcot.  And if he went away to-day, I\r\n  should fear that some one would arrive to-morrow to occupy his\r\n  position.  Yet, my dear sir, justice must be done to you.  After\r\n  protracted and anxious consideration, one mode of action has occurred\r\n  to me, by which atonement may be made to you, for what has passed.\r\n  Let me recommend it to your earnest and favourable consideration.\r\n\r\n  "Some other place of residence would, I should hope, yield you and\r\n  your family the consideration and comfort of which you have here been\r\n  most unjustly deprived.  Elsewhere you might ensure the due reward of\r\n  that professional ability and humanity which we have shown ourselves\r\n  unworthy to appreciate.  If you could reconcile yourself to removing,\r\n  with your family, I believe that the peace of our society would be\r\n  promoted, that unpleasant collisions of opinions and interests would\r\n  be avoided, and that that reparation would be made to you which I fear\r\n  would be impracticable here.  All difficulty about the process of\r\n  removal might and should be obviated.  To speak frankly, I should, in\r\n  that case, consider myself your debtor to such an amount as, by a\r\n  comparison of your losses and my means, should appear to us both to be\r\n  just.  I believe I might venture to make myself answerable for so much\r\n  as would settle you in some more favourable locality, and enable you\r\n  to wait a moderate time for that appreciation of your professional\r\n  merits which would be certain to ensue.\r\n\r\n  "I need not add that, in case of your acceding to my proposition, all\r\n  idea of _obligation_ would be misplaced.  I offer no more than I\r\n  consider actually your due.  The circumstance of the father of a large\r\n  and rising family offering to become responsible to such an extent,\r\n  indicates that my sense of your claim upon me is very strong.  I\r\n  should be glad to be relieved from it: and I therefore, once more,\r\n  beseech your best attention to my proposal,--_the latter particulars\r\n  of which have been confided to no person whatever_,--nor shall they\r\n  be, under any circumstances, unless you desire it.\r\n\r\n  "I shall await your reply with anxiety--yet with patience, as I am\r\n  aware that such a step as I propose cannot be decided on without some\r\n  reflection.\r\n\r\n  "I rejoice to find that your family have not suffered materially from\r\n  the outrages of last night.  It was matter of sincere regret to me\r\n  that the unexpected arrival of my family at the very time prevented my\r\n  hastening to offer my best services to you and yours.  The magistracy\r\n  will, of course, repair all damages; and then I trust no evil\r\n  consequences will survive.\r\n\r\n  "I beg my best compliments to Mrs Hope and Miss Ibbotson, and entreat\r\n  you to believe me, my dear sir,\r\n\r\n  "With the highest respect,\r\n\r\n  "Your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n  "H. Rowland."\r\n\r\nFor one moment Hester looked up in her husband\'s face, as he read this\r\nletter in a subdued voice--for one moment she hoped he would make haste\r\nto live elsewhere--in some place where he would again be honoured as he\r\nonce was here, and where all might be bright and promising as ever: but\r\nthat moment\'s gaze at her husband changed her thoughts and wishes.  Her\r\ncolour rose with the same feelings which drew a deep seriousness over\r\nhis countenance.\r\n\r\n"Mr Rowland means well," said Margaret; "but surely this will never\r\ndo."\r\n\r\n"I hardly know what you would consider meaning well," replied Hope.\r\n"Rowland would buy himself out of an affair which he has not the courage\r\nto manage by nobler means.  He would give hush-money for the concealment\r\nof his wife\'s offences.  He would bribe me from the assertion of my own\r\ncharacter, and would, for his private ends, stop the working out of the\r\nquestion between Deerbrook and me.  This is, to my mind, the real aspect\r\nof his proposal, however persuaded he himself may be that he intends\r\npeace to his neighbours, and justice to me.  This letter," he continued,\r\nwaving it before him, "is worthy only of the fire, where I would put it\r\nthis moment, but that I suppose prudence requires that we should retain\r\nin our own hands all evidence whatever relating to the present state of\r\nour affairs."\r\n\r\n"I do not exactly see what is to become of us," said Hester, cheerfully.\r\n\r\n"Nor do I, love: but is not all the world in the same condition?  How\r\nmuch does the millionaire know of what is to intervene between to-day\r\nand his death?"\r\n\r\n"And the labouring classes," observed Margaret--"that prodigious\r\nmultitude of toiling, thinking, loving, trusting beings!  How many of\r\nthem see further than the week which is coming round?  And who spends\r\nlife to more purpose than some of them?  They toil, they think, they\r\nlove, they obey, they trust; and who will say that the most secure in\r\nworldly fortune are making a better start for eternity than they?  They\r\nsee duty around them and God above them; and what more need they see?"\r\n\r\n"You are right," said Hester.  "What I said was cowardly.  I wish I had\r\nyour faith."\r\n\r\n"You have it," said her husband.  "There was faith in your voice, and\r\nnothing faithless in what you said.  It is a simple truth, that we\r\ncannot see our way before us.  We must be satisfied to discern the duty\r\nof the day, and for the future to do what we ought always to be\r\ndoing--`to walk by faith and not by sight.\'  Now, as to this present\r\nduty, it seems to me very clear.  It is my duty to offer moral\r\nresistance to oppression, and to make a stand for my reputation.  When\r\nit pleases God that men should be overwhelmed by calumny, it is a\r\ndreadful evil which must be borne as well as it may; but not without a\r\nstruggle.  We must not too hastily conclude that this is to be the issue\r\nin our case.  We must stay and struggle for right and justice--struggle\r\nfor it, by living on with firm, patient, and gentle minds.  This is\r\nsurely what we ought to do, rather than go away for the sake of ease,\r\nleaving the prejudices of our neighbours in all their virulence, because\r\nwe have not strength to combat them, and letting the right succumb to\r\nthe wrong, for want of faith and constancy to vindicate it."\r\n\r\n"Oh, we will stay!" cried Hester.  "I will try to bear everything, and\r\nbe thankful to have to bear, for such reasons.  It is all easy, love,\r\nwhen you lay open your views of our life--when you give us your insight\r\ninto the providence of it.  I believe I should have looked at it in this\r\nway before, if you had been suffering in any great cause--any cause\r\nmanifestly great, because the welfare of many others was involved in it.\r\nI see now that the principle of endurance and the duty of steadfastness\r\nare the same, though--."  And yet she paused, and bit her lip.\r\n\r\n"Though the occasion looks insignificant enough," said her husband.\r\n"True.  Some might laugh at our having to appeal to our faith because we\r\nhave been mobbed on pretences which make us blush to think what nonsense\r\nthey are, and because a rival has come to supplant me in my profession.\r\nBut with all this we have nothing to do.  The truth to us is, that we\r\nare living in the midst of malice and hatred, and that poverty stares us\r\nin the face.  If these things are quite enough for our strength (and I\r\nimagine we shall find they are so), we have no business to quarrel with\r\nour trial because it is not of a grander kind.  Well! wife and sister,\r\nwe stay.  Is it not so?  Then I will go and write to Mr Rowland."\r\n\r\nThe sisters were silent for some moments after he had left them.\r\nMargaret was refreshing her flowers--the flowers which Philip had\r\nbrought in from the garden the day before.  How precious were they now,\r\neven above other flowers brought by the same hand--for not another\r\nblossom was left in the desolate garden!  Margaret was resolving\r\nsilently that she would keep these alive as long as she could, and then\r\ndry them in memory of the place they came from, in its wedding trim.\r\nHester presently showed the direction her thoughts had taken, by\r\nsaying--\r\n\r\n"I should think that it must be always possible for able and industrious\r\npeople, in health, to obtain bread."\r\n\r\n"Almost always possible, provided they can cast pride behind them."\r\n\r\n"Ah!  I suspect that pride is the real evil of poverty--of gentlefolks\'\r\npoverty.  I could not promise for my own part, to cast pride behind me:\r\nbut then, you know, it has pleased God to give me something to be proud\r\nof, far different from rank and money.  I could go to jail or the\r\nworkhouse with my husband without a blush.  The agony of it would not be\r\nfrom pride."\r\n\r\n"Happily, we are sure of bread, mere bread," said Margaret, "for the\r\npresent, and for what we call certainty.  What you and I have is enough\r\nfor bread."\r\n\r\n"What I have can hardly be called sufficient for even that," said\r\nHester: "and you--I must speak my thankfulness for that--you will soon\r\nbe out of the reach of such considerations."\r\n\r\n"Not soon: and I cannot separate my life from yours--I cannot fancy it.\r\nDo not let us fancy it just now."\r\n\r\n"Well, we will not.  I am glad Susan has warning from me to go.  It is\r\nwell that we began retrenching so soon.  We must come to some full\r\nexplanation with Morris, that we may see what can best be done for her."\r\n\r\n"She will never leave you while you will let her stay."\r\n\r\n"It may be necessary to dismiss Charles.  But we will wait to talk that\r\nover with my husband.  He will tell us what we ought to do.  Was that a\r\nknock at the door?"\r\n\r\n"I rather think it was a feeble knock."\r\n\r\nIt was Mrs Grey, accompanied by Sydney.  Mrs Grey\'s countenance wore\r\nan expression of solemn misery, with a little of the complacency of\r\nexcitement under it.  The occasion was too great for winks: mute grief\r\nwas the mood of the hour.  Sydney was evidently full of awe.  He seemed\r\nhardly to like to come into the parlour.  Margaret had to go to the\r\ndoor, and laugh at him for his shyness.  His mother\'s ideas were as much\r\nderanged as his own, by the gaiety with which Hester received them,\r\nboasting of the thorough ventilation of the room, and asking whether\r\nSophia did not think their bonfire surpassed the famous one at the last\r\nelection but one.  Sophia had not seen anything of the fire of last\r\nnight.  She had been so much agitated, that the whole family, Mr Grey\r\nand all, had been obliged to exert themselves to compose her spirits.\r\nMuch as she had wished to come this morning, to make her inquiries in\r\nperson, she had been unable to summon courage to appear in the streets;\r\nand indeed her parents could not press it--she had been so extremely\r\nagitated!  She was now left in Alice\'s charge.\r\n\r\nHester and Margaret hoped that when Sophia found there was nothing more\r\nto fear, and that her cousins were perfectly well, she would be able to\r\nspare Alice for some hours, to wait upon Miss Young.  Maria\'s hostess\r\nwas with her now, and Margaret would spend the night with her again, if\r\na nurse could not be procured before that time.  Mrs Grey had not\r\nneglected Maria in her anxiety for her cousins.  She was just going to\r\npropose that Alice should be the nurse to-night, and had left word at\r\nMiss Young\'s door that she herself would visit her for the hour and half\r\nthat people were in church.  Her time this morning was therefore short.\r\nShe was rejoiced to see her young friends look so much like themselves--\r\nso differently from what she had dared to expect.  And Mr Hope--it was\r\nnot fair perhaps to ask where he was;--he had probably rather not have\r\nit known where he might be found: (and here the countenance relaxed into\r\na winking frame).  Not afraid to show himself abroad!  Had been out\r\ntwice! and without any bad consequences!  It would be a cordial to\r\nSophia to hear this, and a great relief to Mr Grey.  But what courage!\r\nIt was a fine lesson for Sydney.  If Mr Hope was really only writing,\r\nand could spare a minute, it would be a comfort to see him.  Hester went\r\nfor him.  He had just finished his letter.  She read and approved it,\r\nand sat down to take a copy of it while her husband occupied her seat\r\nbeside Mrs Grey.\r\n\r\nThe wife let fall a few tears--tears of gentle sorrow and proud love,\r\nnot on her husband\'s letter (for not for the world would she have had\r\nthat letter bear a trace of tears), but on the paper on which she wrote.\r\nThe letter appeared to her very touching; but others might not think\r\nso: there was so much in it which she alone could see!  It took her only\r\na few minutes to copy it; but the copying gave her strength for all the\r\nday.  The letter was as follows:--\r\n\r\n  "My Dear Sir--Your letter expresses, both in its matter and phrase,\r\n  the personal regard which I have always believed you to entertain\r\n  towards me and mine.  I cannot agree with you, however, in thinking\r\n  that the proceeding you propose involves real good to any of the\r\n  parties concerned in it.  The peace of society in Deerbrook is not\r\n  likely to be permanently secured by such deference to ignorant\r\n  prejudice as would be expressed by the act of my departure; nor would\r\n  my wrongs be repaired by my merely leaving them behind me.  I cannot\r\n  take money from your hands as the price of your tranquillity, and as a\r\n  commutation for my good name, and the just rewards of my professional\r\n  labours.  My wife and I will not remove from Deerbrook.  We shall\r\n  stay, and endeavour to discharge our duty, and to bear our wrongs,\r\n  till our neighbours learn to understand us better than they do.\r\n\r\n  "You will permit to say, with the respect which I feel, that we\r\n  sympathise fully in the distress of mind which you must be\r\n  experiencing.  If you should find comfort in doing us manful justice,\r\n  we shall congratulate you yet more than ourselves: if not, we shall\r\n  grieve for you only the more deeply.\r\n\r\n  "My wife joins me in what I have said, and in kindly regards.\r\n\r\n  "Yours sincerely,\r\n\r\n  "Edward Hope."\r\n\r\nEdward had left his seal with Hester.  She sealed the letter, rang for\r\nCharles, and charged him to deliver it into Mr Rowland\'s own hands,\r\nplaced the copy in her bosom to show to Margaret, and returned to the\r\nparlour.  Mrs Grey, who was alone with Hope, stopped short in what she\r\nwas saying.\r\n\r\n"Go on," said Hope.  "We have no secrets here, and no fears of being\r\nfrightened--for one another any more than for ourselves.  Mrs Grey was\r\nsaying, my dear, that Mr Walcot is very popular here already; and that\r\neverybody is going to church to see him."\r\n\r\nMrs Grey had half-a-dozen faults or oddities of Mr Walcot\'s to tell of\r\nalready; but she was quietly checked in the middle of her list by Mr\r\nHope, who observed that he was bound to exercise the same justice\r\ntowards Mr Walcot that he hoped to receive from him--to listen to no\r\nevil of him which could not be substantiated: and it was certainly too\r\nearly yet for anything to be known about him by strangers, beyond what\r\nhe looked like.\r\n\r\n"To go no deeper than his looks, then," continued Mrs Grey, "nobody can\r\npretend to admire them.  He is extremely short.  Have you heard how\r\nshort he is?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; that inspired me with some respect for him, to begin with.  I have\r\nheard so much of my being too tall, all my life, that I am apt to feel a\r\nprofound veneration for men who have made the furthest escape from that\r\nevil.  By the way, my dear, I should not wonder if Enderby is disposed\r\nin Walcot\'s favour by this, for he is even taller than I."\r\n\r\n"I am surprised that you can joke on such a subject, Mr Hope.  I assure\r\nyou, you are not the only sufferers by this extraordinary circumstance\r\nof Mr Walcot\'s arrival.  It is very hard upon us, that we are to have\r\nhim for an opposite neighbour--in Mrs Enderby\'s house, you know.\r\nSophia and I have been in the habit of observing that house, for the old\r\nlady\'s sake, many times in a day.  We scarcely ever looked out, but we\r\nsaw her cap over the blind, or some one or another was at the door,\r\nabout one little affair or another.  It has been a great blank since she\r\nwas removed--the shutters shut, and the bills up, and nobody going and\r\ncoming.  But now we can never look that way."\r\n\r\n"I am afraid you will have to get Paxton to put up a weathercock for you\r\non his barn, so that you may look in the opposite direction for the\r\nwind."\r\n\r\n"Nay, Edward, it is really an evil," said Hester, "to have an unwelcome\r\nstranger settled in an opposite house, where an old friend has long\r\nlived.  I can sympathise with Mrs Grey."\r\n\r\n"So can I, my dear.  It is an evil: but I should, under any\r\ncircumstances, hold myself free to look out of my window in any\r\ndirection--that is all.  Do, Mrs Grey, indulge yourself so far."\r\n\r\n"We cannot possibly notice him, you know.  It must be distinctly\r\nunderstood, that we can have nothing to say to an interloper like Mr\r\nWalcot.  Mr Grey is quite of my opinion.  You will have our support in\r\nevery way, my dear sir; for it is perfectly plain to our minds, that all\r\nthis would not have happened but for your having married into our\r\nconnection so decidedly.  But this intruder has been thought, and talked\r\nabout, by us more than he is worth.  I want to hear all you can tell me\r\nabout the riot, Hester, love.  Your husband has been giving me some idea\r\nof it, but...  Bless me! there is the first bell for church; and I ought\r\nto have been at Miss Young\'s by this time.  We must have the whole\r\nstory, some day soon; and, indeed, Sophia would quarrel with me for\r\nhearing it when she is not by.  Where is Sydney?"\r\n\r\nSydney and Margaret were in the garden, consulting about its\r\nrestoration.  Sydney declared he would come and work at it every day\r\ntill it was cleared and planted.  He would begin to-morrow with the\r\ncairn for the rock-plants.\r\n\r\n"I am glad the Levitts are to call after church," observed Mrs Grey.\r\n"They always do what is proper, I must say; and not less towards\r\ndissenters than their own people.  I suppose Dr Levitt will consult\r\nwith you about the damages."\r\n\r\n"Sooner or later, I have no doubt."\r\n\r\n"Come, Sydney, we must be gone.  You hear the bell.  Sophia will be\r\nquite revived by what I shall tell her, my dears.  No--do not come out\r\nto the door--I will not allow it, on my account.  There is no knowing\r\nwhat I might have to answer for, if you let yourself be seen at the door\r\non my account.  I am sorry you will not come in this evening.  Are you\r\nquite determined?  Well, perhaps Mr Grey will say you are right not to\r\nleave your premises in the evening, at present.  No; you must not say\r\nanything about _our_ coming just now.  We have not courage, really, for\r\nthat.  Now hold your tongue, Sydney.  It is out of the question--your\r\nbeing out of our sight after dark.  Good morning, my love."\r\n\r\nAs soon as Charles returned home, after having delivered the letter into\r\nMr Rowland\'s own hands, Mr Hope gathered his family together, for\r\ntheir Sunday worship.  The servants entered the room with countenances\r\nfull of the melancholy which they concluded, notwithstanding all\r\nevidence to the contrary, that their master and mistress must be\r\nexperiencing: but, when service was over, they retired with the feeling\r\nthat the family-worship had never been more gladsome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY ONE.\r\n\r\nKEEPING SUNDAY.\r\n\r\nMr Enderby was in the churchyard when the congregation poured out from\r\nthe porch.  Group after group walked away, and he saw no signs of the\r\nparty he was waiting for.  Mrs Rowland lingered in the aisle, with the\r\nintention of allowing all Deerbrook time to look at Mr Walcot.  When\r\nnone but the Levitts remained, the lady issued forth from the porch,\r\nleaning on Mr Walcot\'s arm, and followed by four of her children, who\r\nwere walking two and two, holding up their heads, and glancing round to\r\nsee how many people were observing the new gentleman they had brought\r\nwith them from Cheltenham.  Mr Enderby approached the family party, and\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n"Sister, will you introduce me to Mr Walcot?"\r\n\r\n"With the greatest pleasure, my dear brother.  Mr Walcot, my brother,\r\nMr Enderby.  Brother, my friend, Mr Walcot."\r\n\r\nMr Walcot blushed with delight, looked as if he longed to shake hands\r\nif he dared, and said something of his joy at becoming acquainted with\r\nthe brother of so kind a friend as Mrs Rowland.\r\n\r\n"There is not much to be apprehended here," thought Mr Enderby.  "How\r\nperfectly unlike what I had fancied!  This dragon, which was to devour\r\nthe Hopes, seems a pretty harmless creature.  Why he looks a mere boy,\r\nand with hair so light, one can\'t see it without spectacles.  What will\r\nhe do with himself in my mother\'s good house?  Fanny Grey\'s bird-cage\r\nwould suit him better;--and then he might hang in Rowland\'s hall, and be\r\nalways ready for use when the children are ill.  I must have out what I\r\nmean to say to him, however; and, from his looks, I should fancy I may\r\ndo what I please with him.  He will go away before dinner, if I ask him,\r\nI have little doubt.  I wonder that, while she was about it, Priscilla\r\ndid not find out somebody who had the outside of a professional man at\r\nleast.  This youth looks as if he would not draw one\'s tooth for the\r\nworld, because it would hurt one so!  How he admires the rooks and the\r\ngreen grass on the graves, because the children do!--Sister," he\r\ncontinued aloud, "I am sorry to deprive you of your companion; but it is\r\nabsolutely necessary that Mr Walcot and I should have some conversation\r\ntogether immediately.  The children will go home with you; and we will\r\nfollow presently."\r\n\r\nMrs Rowland looked thunder and lightning at her brother; but Mr Walcot\r\nappeared so highly pleased, that she considered it safest to acquiesce\r\nin the present arrangement, trusting to undo Philip\'s work in the course\r\nof the afternoon.  So she sailed away with the children.\r\n\r\n"This is no time for ceremony," observed Enderby, as he led the way to\r\nthe walk under the trees.  "I have used none with my sister, as you\r\nperceive; and I shall use none with you."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, sir.  My dear parents have always taught me that there could\r\nbe no occasion for ceremony where people feel kindly, and mean only what\r\nis right.  They will be pleased to hear that you do not think ceremony\r\nnecessary between us."\r\n\r\n"The circumstances are too urgent for it in the present case;--that is\r\nwhat I mean," said Philip.  "I am confident, Mr Walcot, from what you\r\nsay about feeling kindly and meaning rightly, that you cannot be aware\r\nwhat is the real state of affairs in Deerbrook, or you could not have\r\nbeen induced to think of settling here."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I assure you, sir, you are mistaken.  Mrs Rowland herself was the\r\nperson who told me all about it; and I repeated all she said to my\r\nparents.  They strongly advised my coming; and I am sure they would\r\nnever recommend me to do anything that was not right."\r\n\r\n"Then, if I tell you what I know to be the true state of the case here,\r\nwill you represent it fully to your parents, and see what they will say\r\nthen?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly.  I can have no objection to that.  They will be very sorry,\r\nhowever, if any difficulty should arise.  I had a letter from them this\r\nvery morning, in which they say that they consider me a fortunate youth\r\nto have fallen in with such a friend as Mrs Rowland, who promises she\r\nwill be a mother, or rather, I should say, a sister to me, and to have\r\nstepped at once into such practice as Mrs Rowland says I shall\r\ncertainly have here.  They say what is very true, that it is a singular\r\nand happy chance to befall a youth who has only just finished his\r\neducation."\r\n\r\n"That is so true, that you ought not to be surprised if it should turn\r\nout that there is something wrong at the bottom of the affair.  I am\r\ngoing to show you what this wrong is, that you may take warning in time,\r\nand not discover, when it is too late, that you have been injuring an\r\nhonourable man, who has been too hardly treated already."\r\n\r\n"I should be sorry to do that: but I cannot think what you can mean."\r\n\r\n"I dare say not.  Pray have you been told of a Mr Hope who lives here?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes; we saw the people breaking his windows as we drove past,\r\nyesterday evening.  He must be a very improper, disagreeable man.  And\r\nit is very hard upon the ladies and gentlemen here to have no one to\r\nattend them but that sort of person."\r\n\r\n"That is one account of Mr Hope: now you must hear the other."  And Mr\r\nEnderby gave a full statement of Hope\'s character, past services, and\r\npresent position, in terms which he conceived to be level with the\r\ncapacity of the young man.  He kept his sister out of the story, as far\r\nas it was possible, but did not soften the statement of her calumnies,\r\nthough refraining from exhibiting their origin.  "Now," said he, at the\r\nend of his story, "have I not shown cause for consideration, as to\r\nwhether you should settle here or not?"\r\n\r\n"For consideration, certainly.  But, you see, it is so difficult to know\r\nwhat to think.  Here is Mrs Rowland telling me one set of things about\r\nMr Hope, and you tell me something quite different."\r\n\r\n"Well, what do you propose to do?"\r\n\r\n"I shall consult my parents, of course."\r\n\r\n"Had not you better set off by the coach to-morrow morning, and tell\r\nyour parents all about it before you commit yourself?"\r\n\r\n"I do not see how I could do that very well, as I have engaged to go\r\nover and see these people in Sir William Hunter\'s almshouses, that I am\r\nto have the charge of.  No; I think my best way will be this.  I will\r\nwrite fully to my parents first.  I will do that this afternoon.  Then,\r\nconsidering that I have said I shall stay here, and that the house is\r\ngoing to be got ready for me,--and considering how hard it is upon the\r\nladies and gentlemen here to have nobody to attend them but a person\r\nthey do not like,--and considering, too, that I cannot tell for myself\r\nwhat Mr Hope really is, while people differ so about him, I think I had\r\nbetter wait here (just as I should have done if you had not told me all\r\nthis) till Mrs Rowland, and you, and Sir William Hunter, and everybody,\r\nhave settled whether Mr Hope is really a good man or not: and then, you\r\nknow, I can go away, after all, if I please."\r\n\r\nPhilip thought that Dr Levitt must have been preaching to his new\r\nparishioner to join the wisdom of the serpent with the harmlessness of\r\nthe dove.  Mr Walcot himself seemed quietly satisfied with his own\r\ndecision, for he adhered to it, repeating it in answer to every appeal\r\nthat Philip could devise.\r\n\r\n"I think it right to warn you," said Philip, "that if the prospect of\r\nbeing my mother\'s medical attendant has been part of your inducement to\r\nsettle here, you have been misled in relying on it.  My mother is much\r\nattached to Mr Hope and his family; she prefers him to every other\r\nmedical attendant; and I shall take care that she has her own way in\r\nthis particular."\r\n\r\n"While I am in Mrs Rowland\'s house, I shall, of course, attend Mrs\r\nRowland\'s family," replied Mr Walcot.\r\n\r\n"Her children, if she pleases; but not necessarily her mother."\r\n\r\n"Yes; her mother too, as I dare say you will see."\r\n\r\n"You will allow Mrs Enderby to choose her own medical attendant, I\r\npresume?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes: and I have no doubt she will choose me.  Mrs Rowland says\r\nso."\r\n\r\n"Here comes a gentleman with whom I want to speak," said Philip, seeing\r\nMr Grey approaching from a distance.  "He is as warm a friend and\r\nadmirer of Mr Hope as I am; and--"\r\n\r\n"Mr Hope married into his family,--did not he?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; but Mr Grey and Mr Hope were friends long before either of them\r\nwas acquainted with Mrs Hope.  The friendship between the gentlemen was\r\nmore likely to have caused the marriage than the marriage the\r\nfriendship."\r\n\r\n"Ah! that does happen sometimes, I know."\r\n\r\n"What I was going to say is this, Mr Walcot, that Mr Hope\'s friends\r\nhave determined to see justice done him; and that if, in the prosecution\r\nof this design, you should imagine that you are remarkably coolly\r\ntreated,--by myself, for instance,--you must remember that I fairly\r\nwarned you from the beginning that I shall give no countenance to any\r\none who comes knowingly to establish himself on the ruins of a traduced\r\nman\'s reputation.  You will remember this, Mr Walcot."\r\n\r\n"Oh, certainly.  I am sure I shall expect nothing from anybody; for\r\nnobody here knows me.  It is only through Mrs Rowland\'s kindness that I\r\nhave any prospect here at all."\r\n\r\n"I will just give you one more warning, as you seem a very young man.\r\nThe Deerbrook people are apt to be extremely angry when they are angry\r\nat all.  What would you think of it, if they should break your windows,\r\nas they broke Mr Hope\'s last night, when they find that you have been\r\nthriving upon his practice, while they were under a mistake concerning\r\nhim which you were fully informed of?"\r\n\r\n"I do not think I should mind it.  I might get over it, you know, as Mr\r\nHope would then have done.  Or I might go away, after all, if I pleased.\r\nBut you want to speak to that gentleman; so I will wish you good\r\nmorning."\r\n\r\n"You will represent to your parents all I have said?  Then, pray, do not\r\nomit the last,--about what dreadful people the Deerbrook people are when\r\nthey are angry; and how likely it is that they may be very angry with\r\nyou some day.  I advise you by all means to mention this."\r\n\r\n"Yes, certainly; thank you.  I shall write this afternoon."\r\n\r\n"I wish Mrs Rowland joy of her fledgling," said Enderby, as he joined\r\nMr Grey.\r\n\r\n"I was just thinking, as you and he came up, that a few lessons from the\r\ndrill-sergeant at Blickley would do him no harm.  Perhaps, however, your\r\nsister will teach him to hold up his head better.  I rather think he is\r\na little scared with the rooks, is not he?  What in the world is your\r\nsister to do with him, now she has got him here?"\r\n\r\n"I hope little Anna will lend him her cup and ball on rainy days."\r\n\r\n"Do you find him a simpleton?"\r\n\r\n"I hardly know.  One must see him more than once to be quite sure.  But\r\nenough of him for the present.  I have just come from the corner-house;\r\nbut I am not going to talk about the Hopes either: and yet I have\r\nsomething out of the common way to say to you, my good friend."\r\n\r\n"I am glad you call me by that name," observed Mr Grey, kindly.  "I\r\nnever could see, for the life of me, why men should look askance upon\r\none another, because their relations, (no matter on which side, or\r\nperhaps on both), happen to be more or less in the wrong."\r\n\r\n"And there are other reasons why you and I should beware of being\r\naffected by the faults and weaknesses of our connections, Mr Grey,--and\r\nthat is what I have now to say.  I mean, because we may become connected\r\nourselves.  How will you like me for a relation, I wonder."\r\n\r\n"It is so, then?"\r\n\r\n"It is so: and it is by Margaret\'s desire that I inform you of it now,\r\nbefore the circumstance becomes generally known.  If you think Mrs Grey\r\nwill be gratified by early information, I believe I must beg that you\r\nwill go home and tell her directly.  We are as fully aware as you can\r\nbe, of the absurdity of this way of talking: but circumstances compel us\r\nto--"\r\n\r\n"I know, I understand.  People here have been persuaded that you were\r\nengaged to some other lady; and you will have no help in contradicting\r\nthis from your own family, who may not like your marrying into our\r\nconnection so decidedly--as I have heard the ladies say about our friend\r\nHope."\r\n\r\n"Just so."\r\n\r\n"Well, my opinion is, that it is of little consequence what your friends\r\nmay say now, when time is so sure to justify your choice.  There is no\r\nneed for me to tell you that you are a happy man, Mr Enderby.  There is\r\nnot a more amiable girl living than that cousin Margaret of mine.  I\r\ncharge you to make her happy, Enderby.  I do not mean that I have any\r\ndoubt of it: but I charge you to make her happy."\r\n\r\nPhilip did not like to speak (any more than to do other things) without\r\nbeing pretty sure of doing it well.  He was silent now because he could\r\nnot well speak.  He was anything but ashamed of his attachment to\r\nMargaret; but he could not open his lips upon it.\r\n\r\n"I trust there is the better chance of her being happy," continued Mr\r\nGrey, "that she is going to marry a man of somewhat less enthusiasm than\r\nher sister has chosen, Mr Enderby."\r\n\r\n"Do not speak of that, Mr Grey.  We might not agree.  I can only say\r\nthat I am so fully sensible of my immeasurable inferiority to Hope, I\r\nknow I am hardly worthy to appreciate him...  I cannot give you an idea\r\nof my sense of his superiority...  And to hear him set below me...\r\n\r\n"Do not mistake me, my dear friend.  No one can value Mr Hope more than\r\nI do, as indeed I have every reason to do.  Only you see the effects of\r\nthat unfortunate vote of his.  That is just what I mean, now.  If you\r\nhad been in his place, I rather think you would have done what was\r\nprudent--you would not have run into anything so useless as giving that\r\nvote, when there was not another person in Deerbrook to vote the same\r\nway.  You would not, Enderby."\r\n\r\n"I trust I should, if I had had Margaret to keep me up to my duty."\r\n\r\n"Well, well; I may be wrong; but it vexes me to see anxiety and sorrow\r\nin my cousin Hester\'s beautiful face; and that is the truth of it.  But,\r\nindeed, her husband is a fine fellow, and I respect him from the bottom\r\nof my soul; and it makes me extremely happy to hear that Margaret has\r\nmet with one whom I can as cordially approve.  You have my hearty good\r\nwishes, I assure you.  Now, when may I see my cousin, to wish her joy?\r\nI must go home now, and let my family know about it, you say?"\r\n\r\n"If you please; for I must tell Margaret how kindly you have received\r\nwhat I had to communicate.  She will be waiting anxiously."\r\n\r\n"Why, she could not doubt my good will, surely?  How should I be\r\notherwise than pleased?  Nor have I any doubt of my wife\'s feeling.  You\r\nstand very high in her good graces, Enderby, I can assure you.  I was\r\nnot fully aware of this myself, till I saw how vexed she was at hearing\r\nthat you were engaged to that lady abroad.  She never could make out\r\nwhat Margaret was feeling about that; but she used to say to me when we\r\nwere by ourselves, that if Margaret was not hurt and angry, she was.\r\nBut I suppose the little gipsy was laughing at us and all Deerbrook all\r\nthe time; though she kept her gravity wonderfully."\r\n\r\nPhilip was not disposed to throw any light on this part of the affair;\r\nand the gentlemen parted at the turnstile.  After a few steps, Philip\r\nheard himself called.  Mr Grey was hastening after him, to know whether\r\nthis matter was to be spoken of, or to remain quiet, after Mrs Grey had\r\nbeen informed.  He had perfectly understood that all Deerbrook was soon\r\nto know it; but it was a different question whether his family were to\r\nbe authorised to tell it.  Mr Enderby desired they would follow their\r\nown inclinations entirely.  Margaret\'s only wish was, that her kind\r\nrelations should be informed directly from herself before anybody else\r\nbut her friend, Miss Young: and his own only desire was, that, on\r\nMargaret\'s account, every one should understand that his engagement was\r\nto her, and not to any lady at Rome or elsewhere.  Virtual provision\r\nhaving thus been made for the enlightenment of all Deerbrook in the\r\ncourse of the day, the gentlemen once more went their respective ways.\r\n\r\nIn her present mood of amiability, Mrs Rowland determined on giving the\r\nGreys the pleasure of a call from Mr Walcot.  In the afternoon, when\r\nFanny was saying her catechism to her mamma, and Mary was repeating a\r\nhymn to Sophia, Mrs Rowland\'s well-known knock was heard, and any\r\nreligious feelings which might have been aroused in the minds of the\r\nlittle girls were put to flight by the sound.  Sophia turned her feet\r\noff the sofa, where she had been lying all day, that Mrs Rowland might\r\nnot suspect that she had suffered from the mobbing of the Hopes.  The\r\nchildren were enjoined not to refer to it, and were recommended to avoid\r\nthe subject of Miss Young also, if possible.\r\n\r\nThe amazement and wrath of the party at hearing Mr Walcot announced was\r\nbeyond expression.  Mrs Grey was sufficiently afraid of her neighbour\r\nto confine herself to negative rudeness.  She did the most she dared in\r\nnot looking at Mr Walcot, or asking him to sit down.  He did not appear\r\nto miss her attentions, but seated himself beside her daughter, and\r\noffered remarks on the difference between Deerbrook and Cheltenham.\r\nSophia made no intelligible replies, and looked impenetrably reserved;\r\nhe therefore tried another subject, enlarged upon Mrs Rowland\'s extreme\r\nkindness to him, and said that his parents wrote that they considered\r\nhim a fortunate youth in having met with a friend who would be a mother\r\nor sister to him, now that he was no longer under the parental wing.\r\nSophia had intended to be quite distant and silent, but his long-winded\r\npraises of all the Rowlands were too much for her.  She observed that it\r\nwas generally considered that there was nobody in Deerbrook to compare\r\nwith the family in the corner-house--the Hopes and Miss Ibbotson.  From\r\nthis moment, the _tete-a-tete_ became animated; the speakers alternated\r\nrapidly and regularly; for every virtue in a Rowland there was a noble\r\nquality in a Hope; for every accomplishment in Matilda and Anna, there\r\nwas a grace in "our dear Mr Hope" or "our sweet Hester."  Fanny and\r\nMary listened with some amusement to what they heard on either side of\r\ntheir pair of low stools.  As sure as they were desired particularly to\r\navoid any subject with the Rowlands, they knew that their mother would\r\npresently be in the midst of it.  The prohibition showed that her mind\r\nwas full of it: and whatever her mind was full of was poured out upon\r\nMrs Rowland.  The two ladies were presently deep in the riot, and\r\nalmost at high words about Miss Young.  The girls looked at each other,\r\nand strove to keep the corners of their mouths in order.  In the midst\r\nof the conflict of sentiment on these two subjects, Mrs Rowland\'s ear\r\ncaught what Sophia was saying--that there was one person in the same\r\nhouse with Mr Walcot who properly estimated the Hopes--Mr Enderby, who\r\nwas engaged to Margaret Ibbotson.  While Mr Walcot was carefully\r\nexplaining that Mr Enderby was not in the same house, Mr Enderby\r\nhaving a bed at his mother\'s house still, though that house was already\r\npreparing for the reception of himself, its new tenant, Mrs Rowland\r\nleaned forward with her most satirical air, and begged to assure Miss\r\nGrey that she had been misinformed--that what she had just been saying\r\nwas a mistake.\r\n\r\nSophia looked at her mother in absolute terror, lest they should have\r\nadopted a joke of her father\'s for earnest.  But Mrs Grey was positive.\r\nMrs Rowland laughed more and more provokingly: Mrs Grey grew more and\r\nmore angry; and at last sent the little girls to see whether their\r\nfather was at home, that he might bear his testimony.  He came; and in\r\nreply to his astonishment about what she could mean, Mrs Rowland said\r\nthat she did not deny that there was some present entanglement; but that\r\nshe warned Margaret\'s connections not to suppose that her brother would\r\never be married to Miss Ibbotson.  Mr Grey observed that time would\r\nshow, and inquired after Mrs Enderby.  The report of her was very\r\nflattering indeed.  She was to be quite well now soon.  Mr Walcot\'s\r\nopinion of her case was precisely what Mrs Rowland had always held.\r\nMrs Enderby\'s complaints were nervous--nervous altogether.  With\r\nretirement from common acquaintances, and the society of the dear\r\nchildren, and the attendance of a servant (most highly recommended) who\r\nwould not humour her fancies as Phoebe had done; and, above all, with a\r\nmedical attendant under the same roof for the present, she was to be\r\nquite well immediately.  Mr Walcot\'s countenance wore an expression of\r\nperfect delight at the prospect, and Mr Grey\'s of the blackest\r\ndispleasure.\r\n\r\nWhen the visitors were gone, Mr Walcot being allowed to find his way\r\nout as he could, the little girls heard them discussed in the way which\r\nmight be expected, and were then desired to finish their catechism and\r\nhymn.  Mamma and Sophia were still flushed and agitated with what they\r\nhad been hearing and saying, when the low serious voices of Fanny and\r\nMary recited--the one an abjuration of all envy, malice, hatred, and\r\nuncharitableness; and the other--\r\n\r\n  "Teach me to feel for others\' woe,\r\n  To hide the faults I see;\r\n  The mercy I to others show,\r\n  That mercy show to me."\r\n\r\n"You have a warning, my dear," said Mrs Grey to Fanny, "in the lady who\r\nwas here just now--a terrible warning against malice and all those\r\nfaults.  You see how unhappy she makes every one about her, by her\r\nhaving indulged her temper to such a degree.  You see--"\r\n\r\n"Mary, my darling," said Mr Grey, "repeat that hymn to me again:--\r\n\r\n  "`Teach me to feel for others\' woe,\r\n  To hide the faults I see.\'\r\n\r\n"Let us have that hymn over again, my dear child."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY TWO.\r\n\r\nGOING TO REST.\r\n\r\nMr Walcot had arrived nearly at the end of his letter to his parents,\r\nwhen summoned to attend Mrs Rowland to call on the Greys.  He was\r\nafterwards glad that he had left room to put in that perhaps what Mr\r\nEnderby had said about Deerbrook ought to be the less regarded, from its\r\nhaving come out that he was in an entanglement with the sister-in-law of\r\nthis Mr Hope, when he had rather have been engaged to another person--\r\nbeing actually, indeed, attached to a lady now abroad.  He represented\r\nthat Mrs Rowland evidently paid very little regard to her brother\'s\r\nviews of Deerbrook affairs, now that his mind was in a state of\r\ndistraction between his proper attachment and his new entanglement.  So\r\nMr Enderby\'s opinion ought not to go for more than it was worth.\r\n\r\nThe letter was still not quite finished when he was called to Mrs\r\nEnderby.  She was very ill, and Mr Rowland and Phoebe were alarmed.\r\nPhilip was at the corner-house.  Mrs Rowland was gone to see Miss\r\nYoung, to convince her that she must put herself into Mr Walcot\'s hands\r\nimmediately--to declare, indeed, that she should send her own medical\r\nman to attend her dear children\'s governess.  The argument occupied some\r\ntime, and Mrs Rowland\'s absence was protracted.  Mrs Enderby had been\r\nextremely terrified, the evening before, at the noises she had heard,\r\nand the light of the bonfire upon the sky.  The children were permitted\r\nto carry to her all the extravagant reports that were afloat about Mr\r\nHope being roasted in the fire, the ladies being in the hands of the\r\nmob, and so forth; and though her son-in-law had seen her before she\r\nsettled for the night, and had assured her that everybody was safe, she\r\ncould not be tranquillised.  She thought he was deceiving her for her\r\ngood, and that the children were probably nearest the truth.  She was\r\nunable to close her eyes, and in the middle of the night told Phoebe\r\nthat she could not be satisfied--she should not have a moment\'s peace--\r\ntill she had seen some one of the dear people from the corner-house, to\r\nknow from themselves that they were quite safe.  Phoebe had found it\r\ndifficult to persuade her that it was now two o\'clock in the morning,\r\nand that they were all, no doubt, sleeping in their beds.  She passed a\r\nwretched night; and the next day, after Philip had succeeded in\r\ncomposing her, a strange gentleman was brought to her to prescribe for\r\nher.  This revived her terrors.  She said she would ask no more\r\nquestions, for all were in league to deceive her.  Then she cried\r\nbecause, she had said so harsh a thing, and begged that Phoebe would not\r\nexpose it.  Her weeping continued till Phoebe\'s heart was almost broken.\r\nThe infallible drops failed; arrowroot was in vain; the children were\r\nsent away as soon as they came in, as it would hurt their spirits, their\r\nmother thought, to see distress of this kind.  In the afternoon quiet\r\nwas prescribed by the authorities, and the old lady was left alone with\r\nPhoebe.  To the weeping succeeded the spasms, so violent that little\r\nGeorge was despatched with all speed to summon his uncle, and Mr Walcot\r\nwas called away from crossing the ends of his letter.  No one but he\r\nproposed sending for Mrs Rowland; and his hint to that effect was not\r\ntaken.\r\n\r\nPhilip arrived in a shorter time than could have been supposed possible.\r\nMr Rowland then immediately disappeared.  He had formed the heroic\r\nresolution of bringing Margaret into the house, on his own\r\nresponsibility, for Mrs Enderby\'s relief and gratification and he was\r\ngone to tell Margaret that he considered her now as Mrs Enderby\'s\r\ndaughter, and was come to summon her to the sick bed.  Philip presently\r\ndiscovered that the presence of some one from the Hopes would be the\r\nbest cordial that could be administered; and he set forth on the same\r\nerrand--to bring Margaret, that she might have his protection in case of\r\nhis sister returning before her arrival.  Mrs Rowland did return: and\r\nthe two gentlemen, having taken different roads to the corner-house (it\r\nbeing a matter of old dispute which was the shortest) missed each other.\r\nMargaret was gone with Mr Rowland before Philip arrived.\r\n\r\n"Here I will leave you," said Mr Rowland to Margaret, on the steps of\r\nhis own house.  "You will find Philip and Phoebe upstairs, and Mr\r\nWalcot.  I must go in search of Mr Hope, and beg the favour of him to\r\ntell me whether we are proceeding rightly with our patient.  She is too\r\nill for ceremony."\r\n\r\nMargaret wondered why, if this was the case, Mr Rowland did not bring\r\nEdward to the patient at once; but she had her wonder to herself, for\r\nher escort was gone.  The servant did not more than half-open the door,\r\nand seemed unwilling to let Margaret enter; but she passed in, saying\r\nthat she must see Phoebe for a moment.  She soon found that she was to\r\nbe left standing on the mat; for no person appeared, though she thought\r\nshe heard whispers upstairs.  Ned coming to peep from the study-door,\r\nshe beckoned him to her, and asked to be shown to where Phoebe was.  The\r\nchild took her hand, and led her upstairs.  At the top of the first\r\nflight she met the lady of the house, who asked her, with an air of\r\nastonishment, what she wanted there?  Margaret replied that Mr Rowland\r\nhad brought her to see Mrs Enderby.  That was impossible, the lady\r\nreplied.  Mr Rowland knew that Mrs Enderby was too ill to receive\r\nvisitors.  She herself would send for Miss Ibbotson whenever it should\r\nbe proper for Mrs Enderby to admit strangers.  Margaret replied that\r\nshe must see Phoebe--that she should not retire till she had spoken to\r\nher, or till Mr Rowland\'s return.  Mrs Rowland sent Ned to desire the\r\nservant to open the door for Miss Ibbotson; and Margaret took her seat\r\non a chair on the landing, saying that, relying on her title to be\r\nadmitted to Mrs Enderby, at the desire of her old friend herself, and\r\nof all the family but Mrs Rowland, she should wait till she could\r\nobtain admittance.\r\n\r\nHow rejoiced was she, at this moment, to hear the house door open, to\r\nhear the step she knew so well, to see Philip, and to have her arm drawn\r\nwithin his!\r\n\r\n"Let us pass," said he to his sister, who stopped the way.\r\n\r\n"Rest a moment," said Margaret.  "Recover your breath a little, or we\r\nshall flurry her."\r\n\r\n"She is flurried to death already," said Philip, in his deepest tone of\r\nemotion.  "Priscilla, our mother is dying; it is my belief that she is\r\ndying.  If you have any humanity,--if you have any regard for your own\r\nfuture peace of mind, conduct yourself decently now.  Govern your own\r\nfamily as you will, when you have lost your mother; but hold off your\r\nhand from her last hours."\r\n\r\n"Your own last hours are to come," said Margaret.  "As you would have\r\nMatilda be to you then, be you to your mother now."\r\n\r\n"I must ascertain one thing, Philip," said Mrs Rowland.  "Does my\r\nmother know of what you call your engagement to Miss Ibbotson?"\r\n\r\n"She does not; and the sole reason is, that I would not subject her to\r\nwhat you might say and do.  I wished, for her own sake, to keep the\r\nwhole affair out of her thoughts, when once I had removed the false\r\nimpressions you had given her.  But Margaret and I may see fit to tell\r\nher now.  I may see fit to give her the comfort of a daughter who will\r\nbe to her what you ought to have been."\r\n\r\nHe gently drew his sister aside, to make way for Margaret to pass.\r\n\r\n"In my own house!" exclaimed Mrs Rowland, in a tone of subdued rage.\r\n\r\n"We should have been in the house over the way," replied her brother;\r\n"and we act as if we were there.  Come, my Margaret, we are doing\r\nright."\r\n\r\n"We are," replied Margaret; but yet she trembled.\r\n\r\n"I must go in first, and tell her that I have brought you," said Philip.\r\n"And yet I do not like to leave you, even for a moment."\r\n\r\n"Oh, never mind!  I am not to be shaken now."\r\n\r\nMrs Rowland did not appear during the two long minutes that Margaret\r\nwas left by herself in the dressing-room.  When Philip came for her, he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n"You must not leave her again.  You will stay, will not you?  You shall\r\nbe protected: but you must stay.  I shall tell her how we stand to each\r\nother,--we will tell her,--carefully, for she cannot bear much\r\nemotion.--You are tired,--you must be tired," he continued, looking at\r\nher with anxiety: "but--"\r\n\r\n"Do not speak of it.  I did sleep last night, and there will be time\r\nenough for sleep when duty is done,--the duty for which I have longed\r\never since I knew what duty was."  And her eyes swam in tears.\r\n\r\nPhoebe\'s face was a dismal sight,--too dismal for the sickroom, for so\r\nmany hours had she been in tears.  She was dismissed to refresh herself\r\nwith a turn in the garden.  It was Philip\'s doing that she was at hand\r\nat all.  Mrs Rowland had ordained that she should go; but Philip had\r\nsupported the girl in her resolution to bear anything, rather than leave\r\nher mistress while it was essential to her mistress\'s comfort that she\r\nshould stay.\r\n\r\nMrs Enderby was in great pain; but yet not suffering too much to be\r\ncomforted by finding that all were safe and well in the corner-house.\r\nShe even smiled when the others laughed at the ridiculous stories with\r\nwhich the children had assaulted her imagination.  She thought it was\r\nvery wrong for people to fabricate such things, and tell them to\r\nchildren:--they might chance to put some extremely old ladies into a\r\nterrible fright.--She was soothed in the very midst of a spasm, by\r\nhearing that Margaret would stay with her as long as she liked, if it\r\nwould be of any comfort to her.  In answer to her surprise and almost\r\nalarm at such a blessing, Philip said that Margaret wished it as a\r\npleasure, and asked it as a sort of right.  Now, could she not guess any\r\nreason why it was a sort of right of Margaret\'s to attend upon her like\r\na daughter?  Yes,--it was so indeed!  Margaret was to be her daughter--\r\nsome time or other,--when her big boy should have learned all his\r\nlessons, as little George would say.\r\n\r\n"I am thankful!  Indeed I _am_ thankful, my dears, to hear this.  But,\r\nmy loves, that will be too late for me.  I rejoice indeed; but it will\r\nbe too late for me."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, let me be your daughter now."\r\n\r\nThe old lady clasped her arms about Margaret, and endured her next\r\nparoxysm with her head upon her young friend\'s shoulder.\r\n\r\n"I have a daughter already," said she, when she revived a little: "but I\r\nhave room in my heart for another: and I always had you in my heart, my\r\nlove, from the first moment I saw you."\r\n\r\n"You hold all the world in your heart, I think."\r\n\r\n"Ah! my love, you flatter me.  I mean I took to you particularly from\r\nthe very hour I saw you.  You have always been so kind and gentle with\r\nme!"\r\n\r\nMargaret\'s heart swelled at the thought that any one could ever have\r\nbeen otherwise than kind and gentle to one so lowly and so loving.\r\n\r\nNothing more could be done than was done for the sufferer.  Hope saw\r\nher, at Mr Rowland\'s desire, and said this.  He left directions with\r\nMargaret, and then declined staying where his presence could be of no\r\nuse, and caused much annoyance.  Mrs Enderby was sinking rapidly.  The\r\nprobability was, that a few hours would end the struggle.  Mrs Rowland\r\nwas much alarmed and shocked.  She went and came between the\r\ndrawing-room and her mother\'s chamber, but talked of the claims of her\r\nchildren at such a time, and persuaded herself that her duty lay chiefly\r\nwith them.  Others wanted no persuasion about the matter.  They were too\r\nglad to have her dispose herself where she would be out of her mother\'s\r\nway.  Mrs Enderby looked round now and then, and seemed as if on the\r\npoint of asking for her, but that her courage failed.  At last, about\r\neight in the evening, when Mrs Rowland had come in softly, and Phoebe\r\nhad met her at the door, to say something very unceremonious, Mrs\r\nEnderby\'s voice was heard.\r\n\r\n"Phoebe, I hope you are not preventing any person from coming in.  I\r\nshould wish to see my daughter.  Priscilla, my dear, let me see you.\r\nCome to me, my dear."\r\n\r\nMrs Rowland\'s face was very pale, and her brow told of a dreadful\r\nheadache.  There was a dark expression in her countenance, but the\r\ntraces of irritability were gone.  She was subdued for the hour.\r\n\r\n"My dear daughter," said Mrs Enderby, "I may not be able at another\r\ntime to thank you as I should like for all the care you have taken of\r\nme:--nor can I now do it as I could wish: but I thank you, my love."\r\n\r\nMrs Rowland involuntarily cast a glance at her brother and Margaret, to\r\nsee how they took this: but their eyes were fixed on her mother.\r\n\r\n"And I can only say," continued Mrs Enderby, "that I am aware that you\r\nmust have had many things to bear from me.  I must have been much in\r\nyour way, and often--"\r\n\r\nMargaret and Philip implored her to say nothing of this kind; they could\r\nnot bear it from one who was all patience herself, and gave no cause for\r\nforbearance in others.  Mrs Rowland did not speak--perhaps because she\r\ncould not.\r\n\r\n"Well, well; I will not dwell upon these things.  You are all very kind.\r\nI only wanted to say that I was sensible of--of many things.\r\nPriscilla--"\r\n\r\n"Mother!" said she, starting.\r\n\r\n"This dear young friend of ours,--she calls herself my daughter, bless\r\nher!--is to be your sister, my love.  Philip has been telling me--.  Let\r\nme see--.  Give me the pleasure of seeing--"\r\n\r\nMargaret could have opened her arms to any spectre from the pale\r\nkingdoms at a moment like this, and under the imploring eye of Mrs\r\nEnderby.  She disengaged her hand from that of her old friend, and took\r\nMrs Rowland\'s, offering to kiss her cheek.  Mrs Rowland returned the\r\nkiss, with some little visible agitation.\r\n\r\n"Thank you, my dears!" said Mrs Enderby, in a strong voice of\r\nsatisfaction.  She had made a great effort.  Her speech now failed her;\r\nbut they thought she would have said something about the children.\r\n\r\n"The children--" said Mrs Rowland, rather eagerly.  She turned, and\r\nwent slowly out of the room.  The moment the door was shut, there was a\r\nheavy fall.  She had fainted on the outside.\r\n\r\nHer mother heard it not.  When Mrs Rowland was found to be reviving,\r\nthe children were brought to their grandmamma\'s room.  They quietly\r\nvisited the bed, one by one, and with solemnity kissed the wasted\r\ncheek,--the first time they had ever kissed grandmamma without return.\r\nThe baby made its remark upon this in its own way.  As it had often done\r\nbefore, it patted the cheek rather roughly: several hands were instantly\r\nstretched out to stop its play; it set up a cry, and was hurried out of\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\nBy the middle of the night, Margaret was longing to be at home and\r\nalone.  It was all over.  She was ashamed to think of her own share of\r\nthe loss while witnessing Philip\'s manly grief, or even while seeing how\r\nPhoebe lamented, and how Mr Rowland himself was broken-down; but not\r\nthe less for this was her heart repeating, till it was sick of itself,\r\n"I have lost another mother."\r\n\r\nShe did not see Mrs Rowland again.\r\n\r\nIn the earliest grey of the morning, Mr Rowland took Margaret home.  As\r\nthey stood on the steps, waiting to be let in, she observed that the\r\nmorning star was yellow and bright in the sky.  As soon as the sun had\r\nrisen, the toll of the church bell conveyed to every ear in Deerbrook\r\nthe news that Mrs Enderby was dead.  Perhaps there might have been\r\ncompunction in the breasts of some who had been abroad on Saturday\r\nnight, on hearing the universal remark that it must have been rather\r\nsudden at last.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY THREE.\r\n\r\nMOVING ONWARD.\r\n\r\nThe world rolls on, let what may be happening to the individuals who\r\noccupy it.  The sun rises and sets, seed-time and harvest come and go,\r\ngenerations arise and pass away, law and authority hold on their course,\r\nwhile hundreds of millions of human hearts have stirring within them\r\nstruggles and emotions eternally new,--an experience so diversified as\r\nthat no two days appear alike to any one, and to no two does any one day\r\nappear the same.  There is something so striking in this perpetual\r\ncontrast between the external uniformity and internal variety of the\r\nprocedure of existence, that it is no wonder that multitudes have formed\r\na conception of Fate,--of a mighty unchanging power, blind to the\r\ndifferences of spirits, and deaf to the appeals of human delight and\r\nmisery; a huge insensible force, beneath which all that is spiritual is\r\nsooner or later wounded, and is ever liable to be crushed.  This\r\nconception of Fate is grand, is natural, and fully warranted to minds\r\ntoo lofty to be satisfied with the details of human life, but which have\r\nnot risen to the far higher conception of a Providence, to whom this\r\nuniformity and variety are but means to a higher end, than they\r\napparently involve.  There is infinite blessing in having reached the\r\nnobler conception; the feeling of helplessness is relieved; the craving\r\nfor sympathy from the ruling power is satisfied; there is a hold for\r\nveneration; there is room for hope: there is, above all, the stimulus\r\nand support of an end perceived or anticipated; a purpose which steeps\r\nin sanctity all human experience.  Yet even where this blessing is the\r\nmost fully felt and recognised, the spirit cannot but be at times\r\noverwhelmed by the vast regularity of aggregate existence,--thrown back\r\nupon its faith for support, when it reflects how all things go on as\r\nthey did before it became conscious of existence, and how all would go\r\non as now, if it were to die to-day.  On it rolls,--not only the great\r\nglobe itself, but the life which stirs and hums on its surface,\r\nenveloping it like an atmosphere;--on it rolls; and the vastest tumult\r\nthat may take place among its inhabitants can no more make itself seen\r\nand heard above the general stir and hum of life, than Chimborazo or the\r\nloftiest Himalaya can lift its peak into space above the atmosphere.\r\nOn, on it rolls; and the strong arm of the united race could not turn\r\nfrom its course one planetary mote of the myriads that swim in space: no\r\nshriek of passion nor shrill song of joy, sent up from a group of\r\nnations on a continent, could attain the ear of the eternal Silence, as\r\nshe sits throned among the stars.  Death is less dreary than life in\r\nthis view--a view which at times, perhaps, presents itself to every\r\nmind, but which speedily vanishes before the faith of those who, with\r\nthe heart, believe that they are not the accidents of Fate, but the\r\nchildren of a Father.  In the house of every wise parent may then be\r\nseen an epitome of life,--a sight whose consolation is needed at times,\r\nperhaps, by all.  Which of the little children of a virtuous household\r\ncan conceive of his entering into his parent\'s pursuits, or interfering\r\nwith them?  How sacred are the study and the office, the apparatus of a\r\nknowledge and a power which he can only venerate!  Which of these little\r\nones dreams of disturbing the course of his parent\'s thought or\r\nachievement?  Which of them conceives of the daily routine of the\r\nhousehold--its going forth and coming in, its rising and its rest--\r\nhaving been different before his birth, or that it would be altered by\r\nhis absence?  It is even a matter of surprise to him when it now and\r\nthen occurs to him that there is anything set apart for him,--that he\r\nhas clothes and couch, and that his mother thinks and cares for him.  If\r\nhe lags behind in a walk, or finds himself alone among the trees, he\r\ndoes not dream of being missed; but home rises up before him as he has\r\nalways seen it--his father thoughtful, his mother occupied, and the rest\r\ngay, with the one difference of his not being there.  Thus he believes,\r\nand has no other trust than in his shrieks of terror, for being ever\r\nremembered more.  Yet, all the while, from day to day, from year to\r\nyear, without one moment\'s intermission, is the providence of his parent\r\naround him, brooding over the workings of his infant spirit, chastening\r\nits passions, nourishing its affections,--now troubling it with salutary\r\npain, now animating it with even more wholesome delight.  All the while\r\nis the order of household affairs regulated for the comfort and profit\r\nof these lowly little ones, though they regard it reverently because\r\nthey cannot comprehend it.  They may not know of all this,--how their\r\nguardian bends over their pillow nightly, and lets no word of their\r\ncareless talk drop unheeded, hails every brightening gleam of reason,\r\nand records every sob of infant grief; and every chirp of childish\r\nglee,--they may not know this, because they could not understand it\r\naright, and each little heart would be inflated with pride, each little\r\nmind would lose the grace and purity of its unconsciousness: but the\r\nguardianship is not the less real, constant, and tender, for its being\r\nunrecognised by its objects.  As the spirit expands, and perceives that\r\nit is one of an innumerable family, it would be in danger of sinking\r\ninto the despair of loneliness if it were not capable of:--\r\n\r\n  "Belief\r\n  In mercy carried infinite degrees\r\n  Beyond the tenderness of human hearts,"\r\n\r\nwhile the very circumstance of multitude obviates the danger of undue\r\nelation.  But, though it is good to be lowly, it behoves every one to be\r\nsensible of the guardianship, of which so many evidences are around all\r\nwho breathe.  While the world and life roll on and on, the feeble reason\r\nof the child of Providence may be at times overpowered with the vastness\r\nof the system amidst which he lives; but his faith will smile upon his\r\nfear, rebuke him for averting his eyes, and inspire him with the\r\nthought, "Nothing can crush me, for I am made for eternity.  I will do,\r\nsuffer and enjoy, as my Father wills and let the world and life roll\r\non!"\r\n\r\nSuch is the faith which supports, which alone can support, the many who,\r\nhaving been whirled in the eddying stream of social affairs, are\r\nwithdrawn, by one cause or another, to abide, in some still little\r\ncreek, the passage of the mighty tide.  The broken-down statesman, who\r\nknows himself to be spoken of as politically dead, and sees his\r\nsuccessors at work building on his foundations, without more than a\r\npassing thought on who had laboured before them, has need of this faith.\r\nThe aged who find affairs proceeding at the will of the young and\r\nhardy, whatever the grey-haired may think and say, have need of this\r\nfaith.  So have the sick, when they find none but themselves disposed to\r\nlook on life in the light which comes from beyond the grave.  So have\r\nthe persecuted, when, with or without cause, they see themselves pointed\r\nat in the streets; and the despised, who find themselves neglected,\r\nwhichever way they turn.  So have the prosperous, during those moments\r\nwhich must occur to all, when sympathy fails, and means to much desired\r\nends are wanting, or when satiety makes the spirit roam abroad in search\r\nof something better than it has found.  This universal, eternal, filial\r\nrelation is the only universal and eternal refuge.  It is the solace of\r\nroyalty weeping in the inner chambers of its palaces, and of poverty\r\ndrooping beside its cold hearth.  It is the glad tidings preached to the\r\npoor, and in which all must be poor in spirit to have part.  If they be\r\npoor in spirit, it matters little what is their external state, or\r\nwhether the world which rolls on beside or over them be the world of a\r\nsolar system, or of a conquering empire, or of a small-souled village.\r\n\r\nIt now and then seemed strange to Hope, his wife and sister--now and\r\nthen, and for a passing moment--that while their hearts were full of\r\nmotion and their hands occupied with the vicissitudes of their lot, the\r\nlittle world around them, which was wont to busy itself so strenuously\r\nwith their affairs, should work its yearly round as if it heeded them\r\nnot.  As often as they detected themselves in this thought, they smiled\r\nat it; for might not each neighbour say the same of them as constituting\r\na part of the surrounding world? there a cottage where some engrossing\r\ninterest did not defy sympathy; where there was not some secret joy,\r\nsome heart-sore, hidden from every eye; some important change, while all\r\nlooked as familiar as the thatch and paling, and the faces which\r\nappeared within them?  Yet there seemed something wonderful in the\r\nregularity with which affairs proceeded.  The hawthorn hedges blossomed,\r\nand the corn was green in the furrows: the saw of the carpenter was\r\nheard from day to day, and the anvil of the blacksmith rang.  The\r\nletter-carrier blew his horn as the times came round; the children\r\nshouted in the road; and their parents bought and sold, planted and\r\ndelved, ate and slept, as they had ever done, and as if existence were\r\nas mechanical as the clock which told the hours without fail from the\r\ngrey steeple.  Amidst all this, how great were the changes in the\r\ncorner-house!\r\n\r\nIn the early spring, the hearts of the dwellers in that house had been,\r\nthough far less dreary than in the winter, still heavy at times with\r\ncare.  Hester thought that she should never again look upon the palm\r\nboughs of the willow, swelling with sap, and full of the hum of the\r\nearly bees, or upon the bright green sprouts of the gooseberry in the\r\ncottage gardens, or upon the earliest primrose of the season on its\r\nmoist bank, without a vivid recollection of the anxieties of this first\r\nspring season of her married life.  The balmy month of May, rich in its\r\ntulips, and lilacs, and guelder roses, was sacred to Margaret, from the\r\nsorrow which it brought in the death of Mrs Enderby.  She wandered\r\nunder the hedgerows with Philip, during the short remainder of his stay,\r\nand alone when he was gone; and grew into better acquaintance with her\r\nown state of heart and mind, and into higher hope for the future of all\r\nwhom she loved most.  When the mowers were in the field, and the\r\nchirping fledgelings had become birds of the air, and the days were at\r\nthe longest, her country rambles became more precious, for they must\r\nhenceforth be restricted;--they must be scarcer and shorter.  In the\r\nplace of the leisure and solitude for books in her own room and for\r\nmeditation in the field--leisure and solitude which had been to this day\r\nmore dreamed of than enjoyed, she must now betake herself to more active\r\nduty.  The maid Susan was discharged at Midsummer: and not only Susan.\r\nAfter ample consultation with Morris, it was decided that Charles must\r\ngo too, his place being in part supplied by a boy of yet humbler\r\npretensions out of the house, who should carry out the medicines from\r\nthe surgery, and do the errands of the family.  Morris spoke cheerfully\r\nenough of these changes, smiled as if amused at the idea of her leaving\r\nher young ladies; and did not doubt but that, if Miss Margaret would\r\nlend her a helping hand sometimes, she should be able to preserve the\r\ncredit of the family.\r\n\r\nThere was something more to be done than to lend this helping hand in\r\nthe lighter domestic offices.  Their Midsummer remittance had been\r\neagerly looked for by the sisters, not only because it was exceedingly\r\nwanted for the current expenses of the household, but because it was\r\nhigh time that preparations were begun for the great event of the\r\nautumn--the birth of Hester\'s little one.  During this summer, Margaret\r\nwas up early, and was busy as Morris herself about the house till\r\nbreakfast, and for some time after Hope had gone forth on his daily\r\nround--now so small that he soon returned to his books and his pen in\r\nthe study.  The morning hours passed pleasantly away, while Hester and\r\nMargaret sat at work by the window which looked into their garden, now,\r\nby Sydney\'s care, trimmed up into a state of promise once more.  Hester\r\nwas so much happier, so reasonable, so brave, amidst her sinking\r\nfortunes, that Margaret could scarcely have been gayer than in plying\r\nher needle by her side.  Their cares lay chiefly out of doors now: the\r\nvillagers behaved rudely to Edward, and cherished Mr Walcot; Mrs\r\nRowland took every opportunity of insulting Margaret, and throwing\r\ndiscredit on her engagement; and the Greys caused their cousins much\r\nuneasiness by the spirit, in which they conducted their share of the\r\ngreat controversy of the place.  These troubles awaited the corner-house\r\nfamily abroad; but their peace was perpetually on the increase at home.\r\nMorris and they were so completely in one interest, Edward was so easily\r\npleased, and they were so free from jealous dependants, that they could\r\ncarry their economy to any extent that suited their conscience and\r\nconvenience.  One superfluity after another vanished from the table;\r\nevery day something which had always been a want was discovered to be a\r\nfancy; and with every new act of frugality, each fresh exertion of\r\nindustry, their spirits rose with a sense of achievement, and the\r\ncomplacency proper to cheerful sacrifice.  In the evenings of their busy\r\ndays, the sisters went out with Edward into their garden, or into the\r\nmeadows, or spent an hour in the Greys\' pretty shrubbery.  Maria often\r\nsaw them thus, and thought how happy are they who can ramble abroad, and\r\nfind their cares dispersed by the breeze, or dissolved in the sunshine\r\nof the fields.  The little Rowlands sometimes met them in the lanes: and\r\nthe younger ones would thrust upon them the wild flowers which Mr\r\nWalcot had helped them to gather, while Mrs Rowland and Matilda would\r\ndraw down their black crape veils, and walk on with scarcely a passing\r\nsalutation.  Every such meeting with the lady, every civil bow from Mr\r\nWalcot, every tale which Mrs Grey and Sophia had to tell against the\r\nnew surgeon, seemed to do Hester good, and make her happier.  These\r\nthings were appeals to her magnanimity; and she could bear for Edward\'s\r\nsake many a trial which she could not otherwise have endured.  All this\r\ntold upon the intercourse at home; and Morris\'s heart was often cheered,\r\nas she pursued her labours in kitchen or chamber, with the sound of such\r\nmerry laughter as had seldom been heard in the family, during the\r\nanxious winter that had gone by.  It seemed as if nothing depressed her\r\nyoung ladies now.  There was frequent intelligence of the going over of\r\nanother patient to Mr Walcot; the summer was not a favourable one, and\r\neverybody else was complaining of unseasonable weather, of the certainty\r\nof storms in the autumn, of blight, and the prospect of scarcity; yet,\r\nthough Mr Grey shook his head, and the parish clerk could never be seen\r\nbut with a doleful prophecy in his mouth, Morris\'s young master and\r\nmistresses were gay as she could desire.  She was piously thankful for\r\nMargaret\'s engagement; for she concluded that it was by means of this\r\nthat other hearts were working round into their true relation, and into\r\na peace which the world, with all its wealth and favours, can neither\r\nmake nor mar.\r\n\r\nIn one of Margaret\'s hedgerow rambles with Philip, a few days after his\r\nmother\'s funeral, she had been strongly urged to leave Deerbrook and its\r\ntroubles behind her--to marry at once, and be free from the trials from\r\nwhich he could not protect her, if she remained in the same place with\r\nMrs Rowland.  But Margaret steadily refused.\r\n\r\n"You will be wretched," said Philip; "you will be wretched--I know you\r\nwill--the moment I am gone."\r\n\r\n"I never was less likely to be wretched.  Mrs Rowland cannot make me\r\nso, and other people will not.  I have every expectation of a happy\r\nsummer, which I mention for your sake; for I do not like to indulge in\r\nthat sort of anticipation without some such good reason as comforting\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"You cannot be happy here.  Priscilla will never let you have an easy\r\nday, while she fancies she can separate us.  When I think of the\r\npertinacity with which she disowns you, the scorn with which she speaks\r\nabout you, even in my presence, I see that nothing will do but your\r\nbeing mine at once."\r\n\r\n"That would not mend the matter.  Our haste and imprudence would go to\r\ncountenance the scandal she spreads.  Why cannot we rather live it\r\ndown?"\r\n\r\n"Because your spirit will be broken in the mean time.  Margaret, I must\r\nbe your guardian.  This is my first duty, and an absolute necessity.  If\r\nyou will not go with me, I will not leave this place: and if my plan of\r\nlife is broken up, you will be answerable for it.  It was your plan, and\r\nyou may demolish it if you choose."\r\n\r\n"I have a plan of life, too," said Margaret.  "It is to do the duty that\r\nlies nearest at hand; and the duty that lies nearest at hand is, to keep\r\nyou up to yours.  After this, there is one which lies almost as close, I\r\ncannot leave Hester and Edward till this crisis in their fortunes is\r\npast.  I am bound to them for the present."\r\n\r\n"What are their claims to mine?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing, if they were fortunate, as I trust they yet may be;--nothing,\r\nif you had followed your plan of life up to the point when we may carry\r\nit out together.  We are wrong, Philip, in even thinking of what you\r\nsay.  You must go and study law, and you must go without me.  Indeed, I\r\ncould not be happy to join you yet.  Your good name would suffer from\r\nwhat Mrs Rowland might then say.  Your future prospects would suffer\r\nfrom the interruption of your preparation for your profession.  I should\r\nfeel that I had injured you, and deserted my own duty.  Indeed, Philip,\r\nI could not be happy."\r\n\r\n"And how happy do you imagine we shall be apart?"\r\n\r\nMargaret gave him a look which said what words could not--what it was to\r\nbe assured of his love.  What, it seemed to ask, could all the evil\r\ntongues in the world do to poison this joy?\r\n\r\n"Besides," said she, "I have the idea that I could not be spared; and\r\nthere is great pleasure in that vanity.  Edward and Hester cannot do\r\nwithout me at present."\r\n\r\n"You may say so at any future time."\r\n\r\n"No: when the right time comes, they will not want me.  Oh, Philip! you\r\nare grieved for them, and you long to see them prosperous.  Do not tempt\r\nme to desert them now.  They want my help; they want the little money I\r\nhave; they want my hands and head.  Let this be your share of the\r\npenalty Mrs Rowland imposes upon us all--to spare me to them while\r\ntheir adversity lasts."\r\n\r\n"I would not be selfish, Margaret--I would not trespass upon your wishes\r\nand your duty, but the truth is, I sometimes fear that I may have some\r\nheavier penalty even than this to pay for Priscilla\'s temper.  Ah! you\r\nwonder what can be heavier.  Remember she has put misunderstanding\r\nbetween us before."\r\n\r\n"But she never can again.  Ours was then merely a tacit understanding.\r\nNow, supposing me ever to hear what she may hint or say, do you imagine\r\nI should give the slightest heed to it?  I would not believe her news of\r\na person I had never seen; and do you think she can make the slightest\r\nimpression on me with regard to you."\r\n\r\n"It seems unreasonable at this moment; but yet, I have a superstitious\r\ndread of the power of spirits of evil."\r\n\r\n"Superstitious, indeed!  I defy them all, now that we have once\r\nunderstood each other.  If she were able to do far more than she can--if\r\nshe could load the winds with accusations against you--if she could\r\nhaunt my dreams, and raise you up in visions mocking at me--I believe\r\nshe could not move me now.  Before, I blamed myself--I thought I was\r\nlost in vanity and error: now that I have once had certainty, we are\r\nsafe."\r\n\r\n"You are right, I trust--I believe it.  But there is a long hard battle\r\nto be fought yet.  It fills me with shame to think how she treats you in\r\nevery relation you have.  She is cruel to Maria Young.  She hopes to\r\nreach you through her.  Ah! you will hear nothing of it from Maria, I\r\ndare say; but she spoke infamously to her this morning, before Mrs\r\nLevitt.  Mrs Levitt happened to be sitting with Maria, when Priscilla\r\nand one or two of the children went in.  Mrs Levitt spoke of us:\r\nPriscilla denied our engagement: Maria asserted it--very gently, but\r\nquite decidedly.  Priscilla reminded her of her poverty and infirmities,\r\nspoke of the gratitude she owed to those from whom she derived her\r\nsubsistence, and reproached her with having purposes of her own to\r\nanswer, in making matches in the families of her employers."\r\n\r\n"And Maria?"\r\n\r\n"Maria trembled excessively, the children say, weak and reduced by pain\r\nas she is.  One can hardly conceive of temper carrying any woman into\r\nsuch cruelty!  Mrs Levitt rose, in great concern and displeasure, to\r\ngo: but Maria begged her to sit down again, sent one of the children for\r\nme, and appealed to me to declare what share she had had in my\r\nengagement with you.  I set her right with Mrs Levitt, who, I am\r\nconvinced, sees how the matter stands.  But it was really a distressing\r\nscene."\r\n\r\n"And before the children, too!"\r\n\r\n"That was the worst part of it.  They stood looking from the furthest\r\ncorner of the room in utter dismay.  It would have moved any one but\r\nPriscilla to see the torrent of tears Maria shed over them, when they\r\ncame timidly to wish her good morning, after Mrs Levitt was gone.  She\r\nsaid she could do nothing more for them: they had been taught to despise\r\nher, and her relation to them was at an end."\r\n\r\n"It is; it must be," exclaimed Margaret.  "Is there no way of stopping a\r\ncareer of vice like this?  While Mrs Plumstead gets a parish boy\r\nwhipped for picking up her hens\' eggs from among the nettles, is Maria\r\nto have no redress for slander which takes away her peace and her\r\nbread?"\r\n\r\n"She shall have redress.  For the children\'s sake, as well as her own,\r\nher connection with them must go on.  I do not exactly see how; but the\r\nthing must be done.  I dread speaking to poor Rowland about any of these\r\nthings; I know it makes him so wretched: but the good and the innocent\r\nmust not be sacrificed.  If these poor children must despise somebody,\r\ntheir contempt must be made to fall in the right place, even though it\r\nbe upon their mother."\r\n\r\n"Let us go and see Maria," said Margaret, turning back.  "If there is a\r\njust and merciful way of proceeding in this case, she will point it out.\r\nI wish you had told me all this before.  Here have we been rambling\r\nover the grass and among the wild-flowers, where, at the best, Maria can\r\nnever go; and she lies weeping all alone, looking for me, I dare say,\r\nevery moment!  Let us make haste."\r\n\r\nPhilip made all the haste that was compatible with gathering a handful\r\nof wild hyacinth and meadow narcissus for poor Maria.  He found himself\r\nfarther from success than ever, when he would have again urged Margaret\r\nto marry at once.  A new duty seemed to have sprung up to keep her at\r\nDeerbrook.  Maria wanted her.  Her summer work lay clear before her.\r\nShe must nurse and cheer Maria, she must ply her needle for Hester, and\r\nplay the housewife, spending many of her hours in the business of\r\nliving; a business which is often supposed to transact itself, but,\r\nwhich in reality requires all the faculties which can be brought to it,\r\nand all the good moral habits which conscience can originate.  The most\r\nthat Philip could obtain was, permission to come when his duties would\r\nfairly allow it, and a promise that he should be summoned, if Margaret\r\nfound herself placed in any difficulty by Mrs Rowland.\r\n\r\nMaria was not now literally alone; nor did she depend on her hostess or\r\non Margaret for nursing and companionship.  It occurred to all the\r\nkindest of her friends, immediately after Mrs Enderby\'s death, that\r\nPhoebe might be her attendant.  Phoebe was not, just then, the most\r\ncheerful of nurses, so truly did she mourn her good old mistress; but\r\nshe was glad of occupation, glad to be out of Mrs Rowland\'s way, glad\r\nto be useful: and she was an inestimable comfort to Maria.\r\n\r\nNothing could be done about placing the children again under Maria\'s\r\ncare, when she had recovered.  Mr Rowland was naturally unwilling to\r\nstir in the business, and saw that the best chance for his children was\r\nto send them to school at a distance from Deerbrook: and Maria had been\r\ntoo grossly insulted in the presence of her pupils to choose to resume\r\nher authority.  The Greys took her up with double zeal, as the Rowlands\r\nlet her down.  They assured her that her little income should not suffer\r\nfor her being able to devote all her time to Fanny and Mary.  The money,\r\nindeed, was nothing to Mrs Grey, in comparison with the pleasure it\r\nprocured her.  It put her upon equal terms with Mrs Rowland, at last.\r\nShe did not know how it was, but it was very difficult to patronise Mr\r\nHope.  He always contrived to baffle her praise.  But here was an\r\nunconnected person thrown upon her care: and if Mrs Rowland had a young\r\nsurgeon to push, Mrs Grey had an incomparable governess, now all to\r\nherself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY FOUR.\r\n\r\nOLD AND YOUNG.\r\n\r\nOne of the characteristics of this summer at Deerbrook was the rival\r\nparties of pleasure with which the village was entertained.  There had\r\nbeen rival parties of pleasure the preceding year; but from what a\r\ndifferent cause!  Then, all were anxious to do honour to Hester and\r\nMargaret, or to show off in their eyes: now, the efforts made were, on\r\nthe one hand, to mortify, and on the other, to sustain them.  The\r\nRowlands had a carriage party to the woods one week, and the Greys a\r\ncavalcade to the flower-show at Blickley the next.  The Rowlands gave a\r\ndinner to introduce Mr Walcot to more and more of their country\r\nneighbours; and the Greys had a dance in the green walk for the young\r\npeople of the village.  The Rowlands went to a strawberry gathering at\r\nSir William Hunter\'s; and the Greys, with all their faction, as Mrs\r\nRowland called it, were invited to a syllabub under the cow, at the Miss\r\nAndersons\' breaking-up for the holidays.\r\n\r\nAll pretence of a good understanding between the two families was now at\r\nan end.  They ceased to invite each other, and scrambled for their\r\nmutual acquaintances.  The best of their mutual acquaintances saw no\r\nreason for taking part in the quarrel, and preserved a strict\r\nneutrality; and the worst enjoyed being scrambled for.  The Levitts\r\nvisited both families, and entertained everybody in return, as if\r\nnothing was happening.  Sir William and Lady Hunter ate their annual\r\ndinner with each, and condescended to pay two or three extra visits to\r\nMrs Rowland, without making a point of a full moon.  Every circumstance\r\nthat happened afforded occasion for comment, of course.  Mrs Grey\r\nthought it very improper in the Rowlands to indulge in all this gaiety\r\nwhile they were in deep mourning.  It was painful to her feelings, she\r\nowned, to hear the children shouting with laughter, while they were all\r\nbombazine and crape from head to foot: she had hoped to see the memory\r\nof her dear old friend treated with more respect.  In vain did Mr Hope\r\nplead Mrs Enderby\'s delight in the mirth of children, and that their\r\ninnocent gaiety would cheer her in her grave, if it could reach her\r\nthere.  In vain did Hester urge the danger and sin of training the\r\nlittle creatures to hypocrisy--a probable result, if they were to be\r\nkept solemn and unamused to the day when they might put off their\r\nmourning.  Mrs Grey felt herself only the more called upon by all this\r\nto furnish the amount of sighs and tears which she believed to be due to\r\nMrs Enderby\'s memory.  Margaret rather sided with her--it was so sweet\r\nto her to hear Philip\'s mother mourned.\r\n\r\nMrs Grey\'s tears were, however, interspersed with smiles.  On the day\r\nof the Rowlands\' great dinner-party, when all was to be so stately for\r\nthe Hunters, when the new dessert service was procured from\r\nStaffordshire, the fish had not arrived from London.  This was certainly\r\na fact; the fish had come by the coach the next morning.  And what was\r\nstill more remarkable, it had not occurred to Mrs Rowland that such an\r\naccident might happen--was very likely to happen; and, as if she had\r\nbeen an inexperienced housekeeper, she had not any dish in reserve, in\r\ncase of the non-arrival of the fish.  It was said that Mrs Rowland had\r\nsat down to table with a face perfectly crimson with anxiety and\r\nvexation.  To such a temper as hers, what a vexation it must have been!\r\nThere was a counterpart to this story for Mrs Rowland.  She fancied\r\nthat Mrs Grey\'s friends, the Andersons, must have looked rather foolish\r\non occasion of their great syllabub party.  She hoped the Miss Andersons\r\ntrained their pupils better than their cows: they had a sad obstreperous\r\ncow, she understood.  Some of the young ladies had lured it up the lawn\r\nwith a potato, and got it to stand still to be milked; but, when\r\nsomebody began to sing (she had no doubt it was Miss Ibbotson who sang)\r\nthe poor animal found the music was not to its taste, and, of course, it\r\nkicked away the china bowl, and pranced down the lawn again.  There was\r\na dirge sung over the syllabub, no doubt.  The poor Miss Andersons must\r\nhave been terribly annoyed.\r\n\r\nThe good understanding of the gentlemen seemed all this time to be\r\nuninterrupted.  They had much to put up with at home on this account;\r\nbut their good-humour towards each other remained unbroken.  Mr\r\nRowland\'s anxious face, and his retirement within the enclosure of his\r\nown business, told his neighbours something of what he had to go through\r\nat home.  Mrs Grey was vexed with her husband that he did not visit\r\nHope\'s misfortunes upon Mr Rowland, and call the husband to account for\r\nthe mischief the wife had caused; and Hester more than once expressed\r\nsome resentment against her relation for not espousing Edward\'s cause\r\nmore warmly.  Hope told her this was not reasonable.\r\n\r\n"Remember," said he, as they sauntered in their garden, one evening,\r\n"that these gentlemen must be more weary than we are (which is saying a\r\ngreat deal) of these perpetual squabbles; and they must earnestly desire\r\nto have peace in the counting-house.  God forbid that their dominions\r\nshould be invaded for our sake!"\r\n\r\n"Not for our sake only, but for the sake of justice."\r\n\r\n"Everything depends on the sort of men you have to deal with, in such\r\ncases as this.  You must not expect too much.  Here are two kind-hearted\r\nmen, bound to each other by mutual good will and mutual interest.  There\r\nis no other resemblance between them, except that they are both\r\noverpowered--made rather cowardly by the circumstances of their\r\nenvironment.  Once departing from their plan of keeping the peace, they\r\nwould be plunged into quarrel.  They view things so differently, from\r\nthe differences of their minds, that their only safety is in avoiding\r\naltogether all subjects of Deerbrook contention.  If you expect the\r\nheroism of devoted friendship, or of an enthusiastic sense of justice\r\nfrom such men, you will not find it.  We must take them as they are."\r\n\r\n"And humbly accept such countenance as they choose to bestow?"\r\n\r\n"Take it or leave it, as you will.  There is no use in quarrelling with\r\nthem for not being what they are not--that is all.  Be generous with\r\nthem; and do not expect from them the conduct which they have a right to\r\nexpect from you."\r\n\r\n"I rather wonder," observed Margaret, "that they have had the courage to\r\ngo so far as they do, in bearing testimony in your favour."\r\n\r\n"They have been very handsome in their conduct on the whole; and it\r\nwould grieve me sincerely if they were to suffer further than they have\r\nalready done on my account.  I am afraid Mr Rowland is wretched now,\r\nbecause I will accept no assistance from him.  He told me, the other\r\nday, that he should receive no rent for this house while Walcot occupies\r\nthe other.  He was beyond measure mortified when I positively declined\r\nbeing under any such obligation to any landlord.  If Mr Rowland\r\nsteadily refuses to turn us out of our house, and goes on offering\r\nfavours that I cannot accept, that is all we can expect from him."\r\n\r\n"It never occurred to me that he can turn us out," said Hester, "that we\r\nare tenants at will.  Oh! how sorry I should be to go!" she continued,\r\nas she surveyed the place.  "I should grieve to quit our first home."\r\n\r\n"There is no danger I believe: Mr Rowland will be firm on that head."\r\n\r\n"And there is no danger, I should think," said Margaret, "but that the\r\nGreys would find us something better the next day.  Oh, I do not know\r\nwhere or how; but it would be such a splendid opportunity for patronage,\r\nthat they would work miracles rather than let it slip.  How far this ivy\r\nhas trailed over the wall already!  I should be sorry to leave this\r\ngarden now that it promises to look like itself so soon again.  Sydney\r\ndespises me for my admiration of it at present.  He looks melancholy\r\nabout the blight.  It is a pity certainly.  Look at this rose-bush, how\r\ncurled and withered it is!"\r\n\r\n"Sydney is doing like every one else in looking grave about the blight,"\r\nobserved Hope.  "So bad a season has not been known since I came to\r\nDeerbrook.  I see care in the face of many an one who does not stand\r\nanything like our chance of want.  Here comes Sydney, with news of every\r\nill-looking field for five miles round, I doubt not."\r\n\r\n"And Mr and Mrs Grey, and Sophia," said Hester, quitting her husband\'s\r\narm, and hastening to meet her friends.\r\n\r\nThe Greys pronounced it so pleasant an evening, that they had no wish to\r\nsit down within doors; they preferred walking in the garden.  They\r\nseemed to come for two purposes--to offer an invitation, and to relate\r\nthat Mr Walcot was gone to dine at Sir William Hunter\'s to-day, and\r\nthat Sir William had sent the carriage for him.  Mr Walcot had not been\r\nready for full five minutes after the carriage had driven up to the\r\ndoor.  This delay was no doubt intended to give all Deerbrook time to\r\nobserve the peculiar consideration, with which Mr Walcot was treated by\r\nSir William and Lady Hunter, who were by no means in the habit of\r\nsending their carriage for their Deerbrook guests.\r\n\r\n"Did you ever hear of such a thing," said Sophia, "as sending a carriage\r\nfor a young man?  I have no doubt it is because he cannot ride."\r\n\r\n"There you are out, Sophy," cried Sydney.  "Mr Walcot rides as well as\r\nMr Hope, every bit."\r\n\r\n"I cannot think what has happened to Sydney," observed his mother.  "He\r\ndoes nothing but stand up for Mr Walcot in the most unaccountable way!\r\nI hope you will forgive it, Mr Hope.  Boys take strange fancies, you\r\nknow.  You must forgive it, my dears, in consideration of the rest of\r\nus."\r\n\r\n"Instead of forgiving it," said Hope, "I shall take leave rather to\r\nadmire it.  There is a fine chivalrous spirit shown in fighting Mr\r\nWalcot\'s battles with our friends and relations."\r\n\r\n"There, now!" cried Sydney, triumphantly.  "But I can\'t help it, you\r\nsee.  Mr Walcot can ride, and he does ride well; and he is very civil\r\nto me, and asks me to go fishing with him; and I am sure he always\r\ninquires very respectfully after the rest of them.  I never said any\r\nmore than that in praise of him; and I can\'t say less, can I, when they\r\nare all abusing him for whatever he does?"\r\n\r\n"I think not.  I believe we may spare him that much credit without\r\ngrudging."\r\n\r\n"But, Sydney, you know it is not pleasant to us to hear you speak in\r\npraise of Mr Walcot under present circumstances; and you should have a\r\nlittle consideration for us."\r\n\r\n"Well, mother, if you will not speak of him at all, no more will I."\r\nAnd he glanced up into his mother\'s face, to see how the proposition was\r\ntaken.  "That is fair, is not it?" he inquired of Mr Hope.\r\n\r\n"Excellent in theory, Sydney; but who likes to be tied down not to speak\r\non any subject, especially one which is turning up every hour?  Your\r\nplan will not answer."\r\n\r\n"I will ask you because I said I would--and all the more because you are\r\nnot cross about Mr Walcot--"\r\n\r\n"Hold your tongue, Sydney!" said the mother.\r\n\r\n"Do not be ridiculous, Sydney," advised the sister.\r\n\r\n"Mr Hope will say whether it is ridiculous, Sophy.  Now, Mr Hope,\r\nwould not you, and cousin Hester, and Margaret, go down the water with\r\nus to the abbey, just the same if Mr Walcot was with us?"\r\n\r\n"With any guest of your father\'s and mother\'s, Sydney.  We have no\r\nquarrel with Mr Walcot.  The truth is, we feel, after all we have\r\nheard, that we know very little about him.  We have not the slightest\r\nobjection to meet Mr Walcot."\r\n\r\n"Neither wish nor objection," said Hester, calmly.  "We are perfectly\r\nindifferent about him."\r\n\r\nSydney vehemently beckoned his father, who left the apricot he and\r\nMargaret were examining by the surgery wall, and came to see what he was\r\nwanted for.\r\n\r\n"You see," said he to Hope, when the matter was explained, "I have\r\nnaturally been rather anxious to bring this about this meeting between\r\nyou and the young man.  In a small place like this, it is painful to\r\nhave everybody quarrelling, and not to be able to get one\'s friends\r\nabout one, for fear they should brawl in one\'s very drawing-room.  Mr\r\nRowland is of my mind there; and I know it would gratify him if I were\r\nto take some notice of this young man.  I really could hardly refuse,\r\nknowing how handsomely Mr Rowland always speaks of you and yours, and\r\nbelieving Mr Walcot to be a very respectable, harmless young man.  If I\r\nthought it would injure your interests in the least, I would see him at\r\nCape Horn before I would invite him, of course: you must be aware of\r\nthat.  And I should not think of asking you to meet Mrs Rowland; that\r\nwould be going too far.  But Mrs Grey wishes that your wife and\r\nMargaret should visit these ruins that we were always prevented from\r\ngetting to last year: and Mr Walcot is anxious to see them too; and he\r\nhas been civil to Sydney; and, in short, I believe that Sydney half\r\npromised that he should go with us."\r\n\r\n"Say no more," replied Hope.  "You will have no difficulty with us.  I\r\nreally know nothing against Mr Walcot.  He had a perfect right to\r\nsettle where he pleased.  Whether the manner of doing it was handsome or\r\notherwise, is of far more consequence to himself than to me, or to any\r\none else."\r\n\r\n"I wish we all viewed the matter as you do.  If the ladies had your\r\ntemper, we should have a heaven upon earth.  But they take things up so\r\nwarmly, you see, when their feelings are interested for anybody; Mrs\r\nRowland for one, and my wife for another.  I hardly know what she will\r\nsay to the idea of our having Walcot with us.  Let us go and see."\r\n\r\n"I have a word to say to you first.  Do you know of any one who wants a\r\nhorse?  I am going to dispose of mine."\r\n\r\n"Mr Walcot wants a horse," said Sydney, delighted at the idea of\r\nsolving a difficulty.\r\n\r\nHope smiled, and told Mr Grey that he had rather sell his horse at a\r\ndistance.  Mr Walcot had already hired the boy Charles, whom Hope had\r\njust dismissed; and if he obtained the horse too, the old servant who\r\nknew his way to every patient\'s door, all the country round--it really\r\nwould look too like the unpopular man patronising his opponent.\r\nBesides, it would be needlessly publishing in Deerbrook that the horse\r\nwas given up.\r\n\r\n"What is the fault of your horse?" asked Mr Grey, rousing himself from\r\nan absent fit.\r\n\r\n"Merely that he eats, and therefore is expensive.  I cannot afford now\r\nto keep a horse," he declared, in answer to Mr Grey\'s stare of\r\namazement.  "I have so few patients now out of walking reach, that I\r\nhave no right to keep a horse.  I can always hire, you know, from\r\nReeves."\r\n\r\n"Upon my soul, I am sorry to hear this--extremely sorry to hear it.\r\nMatters must have gone further than I had any idea of.  My dear fellow,\r\nwe must see how we can serve you.  You must let me accommodate you--\r\nindeed you must--rather than give up your horse."\r\n\r\n"Do not speak of it.  You are very kind; but we need no help, I do\r\nassure you.  My mind is quite made up about the horse.  It would only be\r\nan incumbrance now.  And, to satisfy you, I will mention that I have\r\ndeclined repeated offers of accommodation--offers very strongly urged.\r\nAll I need ask of you is, to help me to dispose of my horse, somewhere\r\nout of Deerbrook."\r\n\r\n"I will manage that for you, the next time I go to market; and--" In the\r\nemotion of the moment, Mr Grey was on the point of offering the use of\r\nhis own horse when it should be at home: but he stopped short on the\r\nverge of his rash generosity.  He was very particular about no one\r\nriding his horse but himself and the man who groomed it: he remembered\r\nhis friend Hope\'s rapid riding and `enthusiasm\' and suspected that he\r\nshould sooner or later repent the offer: so he changed it into, "I will\r\nget your horse disposed of to the best advantage, you may depend upon\r\nit.  But I am very sorry--very sorry, indeed."\r\n\r\nIt is probable that nothing could have reconciled the ladies of Mr\r\nGrey\'s family to the idea of admitting Mr Walcot into their party, but\r\nthe fact that they had of late cut rather a poor figure in contrast to\r\nMrs Rowland.  That lady had the advantage of novelty in the person of\r\nMr Walcot, and her `faction\' was by far the larger of the two.  The\r\nGreys found fault with all its elements; but there was no denying its\r\nsuperiority of numbers.  It was a great hardship to have Mr Walcot\r\nforced upon them; but they reflected that his presence might bring a\r\nreinforcement--that some neighbours would perhaps come to meet him, who\r\nwould be otherwise engaged to the Rowlands, for the very day on which\r\nthey were wanted; for Mrs Rowland had the art of pre-engaging just the\r\npeople the Greys intended to have.  Sophia observed that Mr Walcot\'s\r\npresence would be less of a restraint in a boat, and at tea among the\r\nruins, than in the drawing-room: there was always something to be said\r\nabout the banks and the woods; and there was singing; and in a boat\r\npeople were not obliged to talk unless they liked.  She should not\r\nwonder if he would rather relish a little neglect; he had been made much\r\nof lately at such a ridiculous rate.\r\n\r\n"If we do our part, my love," said Mrs Grey to Hester, in a mysterious\r\nlow voice, "I think you should exert yourselves a little.  Nothing can\r\nbe done without a little exertion in this world, you know.  Sophia and I\r\nwere agreeing that it is a long time since you had any of your friends\r\nabout you."\r\n\r\n"Very few since your wedding company," observed Sophia.\r\n\r\n"We remember you had all your acquaintance in the winter, my dear.  It\r\nwas very proper, I am sure, all you did then: but it is now the middle\r\nof July, you know; and our neighbours if Deerbrook always expect to be\r\ninvited twice a year."\r\n\r\n"I should be happy to see them, I assure you," said Hester, "but it\r\nhappens to be not convenient."\r\n\r\n"Not convenient, my dear!"\r\n\r\n"Just so.  We shall always be glad to see you and yours; but we have no\r\nhospitality to spare for the common world just now.  We have no\r\nservants, you know, but Morris; and we are spending as little as we\r\ncan."\r\n\r\n"Tea company costs so very little!" said Sophia.  "At this time of the\r\nyear, when you need not light candles till people are going away, and\r\nwhen fruit is cheap and plentiful--"\r\n\r\n"And we will take care of the cake," interposed Mrs Grey.  "Sophia will\r\nmake you some of her vicarage-cake, and a batch of almond biscuits; and\r\nAlice shall come and wait.  We can manage it very easily."\r\n\r\n"You are extremely kind: but if our acquaintance are to eat your cake,\r\nit had better be at your house.  It does not suit our present\r\ncircumstances to entertain company."\r\n\r\n"But it costs so very little!" persisted Sophia.  "Mr Russell Taylor\'s\r\nfather used to give a general invitation to all his friends to come to\r\ntea in the summer, because, as he said, they then cost him only\r\ntwopence-halfpenny a-head."\r\n\r\n"I am afraid we are not such good managers as Mr Russell Taylor\'s\r\nfather," replied Hester, laughing.  "And if we were, it is not\r\nconvenient to spend even twopence-halfpenny a-head upon our common\r\nacquaintance at present.  If we grow richer, we will get our friends\r\nabout us, without counting the cost so closely as that."\r\n\r\n"That time will soon come, Sophia, my dear," said her mother, winking at\r\nHester.  "In every profession, you know, there are little ups and downs,\r\nand particularly in the medical.  I dare say, if the truth were told,\r\nthere is scarcely any professional man, without private fortune, who has\r\nnot, at some time of his life, broken into his last guinea without\r\nknowing where he is to get another.  But professional people generally\r\nkeep their difficulties to themselves, I fancy, Hester: they are not\r\noften so frank as you.  Mind that, Sophia.  You will be discreet,\r\nSophia."\r\n\r\n"We have no intention of proclaiming in the streets that we are poor,"\r\nsaid Hester.  "But we owe it to you, dear Mrs Grey, to give our reasons\r\nfor not doing all that we and you might wish.  We are not dissatisfied:\r\nwe want no help or pity: but we must live as we think right--that is\r\nall."\r\n\r\n"Indeed, my dear, I must say you do not look as if anything was amiss.\r\nYou look charmingly, indeed."\r\n\r\n"Charmingly, indeed," echoed Sophia.  "And Mrs Levitt was saying, that\r\nMargaret seems to have grown quite handsome, this summer.  I fancy Mrs\r\nRowland gets very few to agree with her as to Margaret being so very\r\nplain."\r\n\r\n"No, indeed.  Margaret\'s countenance is so intelligent and pleasant that\r\nI always said, from the beginning, that nobody but Mrs Rowland could\r\ncall her plain.  I suppose we shall soon be losing her, Hester."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no; not soon.  She has no thought of leaving us at present.  She\r\nwould not go in the spring, and sit beside Philip while he was learning\r\nhis lessons; and now, they will wait, I believe, till the lessons are\r\nfinished."\r\n\r\n"She would not!  Well, that shows what love will do.  That shows what\r\nher power over Mr Enderby is.  We used to think--indeed, everybody used\r\nto say it of Mr Enderby, that he always managed to do as he liked--he\r\ncarried all his points.  Yet even he is obliged to yield."\r\n\r\n"Margaret has a way of carrying her points too," said Hester: "the best\r\nway in the world--by being always right."\r\n\r\n"Mind that, Sophia.  But, my dear Hester, I am really anxious about you.\r\nI had no idea, I am sure--.  I hope you get your natural rest."\r\n\r\n"Perfectly, I assure you.  Mrs Howell might envy me, if she still\r\n`cannot sleep for matching of worsteds.\'  The simple truth is, Mrs\r\nGrey, we never were so happy in our lives.  This may seem rather\r\nperverse; but so it is."\r\n\r\nMrs Grey sighed that Mrs Rowland could not be aware of this.  Hester\r\nthought it was no business of Mrs Rowland\'s; but Mrs Grey could not\r\nbut feel that it would be a great satisfaction that she should know that\r\nthose whom she hated, slept.  She heard Margaret and Sydney saying\r\nsomething in the middle of the grass-plot about the Milky Way: looking\r\nup, she was surprised to perceive how plain it was, and how many stars\r\nwere twinkling in the sky.  She was sure Hester must be dreadfully tired\r\nwith sauntering about so long.  They had been very inconsiderate, and\r\nmust go away directly.  Sydney must call his father.\r\n\r\n"They are delightful young people, really," observed Mrs Grey to her\r\nhusband, during their walk home.  "One never knows how to get away.\r\nLady Hunter little supposes what she loses in not cultivating them.  Go\r\non before us, Sophia.  Make haste home with your sister, Sydney.  But,\r\nmy dear, they speak in a very poor way of their affairs."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Hester spoke to you, did she?  Hope told me he must part with his\r\nhorse.  So Hester spoke to you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes: not at all in a melancholy way, however.  She keeps up her spirits\r\nwonderfully, poor girl!  We really must push them, Mr Grey.  I see\r\nnothing but ruin before them, if we do not push them."\r\n\r\n"Ah! there is the difficulty: that is where that little enthusiasm of\r\nHope\'s comes in.  I have a great respect for him; but I own I should\r\nlike to see him a little more practical."\r\n\r\n"I really am pleased to hear you say so.  It is just what I think; and I\r\nalways fancied you did not agree with me.  It really puts me almost out\r\nof patience to hear him speak of Mr Walcot--encouraging Sydney in his\r\nnotions!  It is unnatural: it looks a little like affectation--all that\r\nsort of feeling about Mr Walcot."\r\n\r\n"I do not object to that, I confess.  His thinking fairly of Walcot can\r\ndo no harm, and may save mischief, and it looks honourable and well.  I\r\ndo not regret that, I own.  But I think he is clearly wrong in selling\r\nhis horse in such a hurry.  All Deerbrook will know it directly, and it\r\nwill not look well.  I offered him such accommodation as would enable\r\nhim to keep it; but he is quite obstinate.  Some enthusiastic notion of\r\nhonour, I suppose--.  But I told them that there is no profession or\r\nbusiness in the world that has not its ups and downs."\r\n\r\n"Exactly what I told Hester, when she declined having any parties at\r\npresent--in the very crisis, in my opinion, when it is of great\r\nconsequence that they should get their friends about them.  Sophia would\r\nhave made the cake, and Alice would have waited at tea.  But the fact\r\nis, Mr Hope has put some of his spirit into his wife, and they must\r\ntake their own way, I suppose."\r\n\r\n"He gave me his reasons, however," observed Mr Grey.  "He regards this\r\nas something more than one of the slack times common in his profession.\r\nHe will not accept obligation, while he sees no clear prospect of being\r\nable to discharge it.  I could not prevail upon him.  However, they must\r\nhave enough: they cannot be actually pinched.  I never saw him in better\r\nspirits.  There can be no occasion for our doing anything more than just\r\nbeing on the look-out to serve them."\r\n\r\n"We must push them--that is all we can do.  They cannot really be\r\nwanting anything, as you say, such fine spirits as they are in.  Hester\r\nlooks sweetly.  The first game that we have to spare this season shall\r\ngo to them: and I shall bear them in mind when we gather our apples."\r\n\r\n"If you find we have any apples to gather, my dear.  I doubt it."\r\n\r\n"Do you really?  It will be unfortunate for our young friends, if prices\r\nrise next winter, as you seem to expect.  There goes ten o\'clock, I\r\ndeclare; and there are the children looking out for us, as well they\r\nmay.  But those are really delightful young people.  There is no getting\r\naway from them."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY FIVE.\r\n\r\nBOATING.\r\n\r\nMr Walcot was delighted with the invitation to the water-party, but was\r\nfully engaged for the next three weeks.  Mr Grey decreed that he was to\r\nbe waited for.  Then the lady moon had to be waited for another ten\r\ndays; so that it was past the middle of August before Mrs Grey and\r\nSophia were called upon to endure Mr Walcot\'s society for six hours.\r\nThe weather was somewhat dubious when the day arrived: but in so bad a\r\nseason as the present, it would never do to let a doubt put a stop to an\r\nexcursion which had been planned above a month.  One of Mr Grey\'s men\r\nwas sent round among the ladies in the morning, to request to be the\r\nbearer of their cloaks, as it was thought they would be cold on the\r\nwater without all the wraps they had.  Hester sent as many warm things\r\nas she thought Margaret could possibly wear.  She was not going herself.\r\nShe wished it much; but it was decided on all hands that it would be\r\nimprudent, as there was no calculating the amount of fatigue which each\r\nmight have to incur.\r\n\r\nAt three o\'clock the party assembled on the wharf on Messrs. Grey and\r\nRowland\'s premises, everyone having dined at home.  Mrs Rowland had\r\ntried to persuade Mr Walcot that he ought not to be out of the way,\r\nafter what Lady Hunter had said in a note about her terrible headache of\r\nyesterday.  It might be the beginning of a feverish attack; and it would\r\nbe unfortunate if he should be six miles down the river--not expected\r\nhome till nine or ten at night, when a messenger should arrive from the\r\nHall.  But Mr Walcot had seen few water-parties in the course of his\r\nlife, and he was resolved to go.\r\n\r\nMargaret and her brother repaired in gay spirits to the water-side.  In\r\nthe days of poverty, trifles become great events, and ease is luxury.\r\nHope felt himself clear of the world to-day.  He had received the money\r\nfrom the sale of his horse; and after paying for its corn, there was\r\nfifteen pounds left to be put by for his rent.  Hester had bidden adieu\r\nto the horse with a sort of glee, as she had never been able to overcome\r\nher panic during her husband\'s long country rides; and Hope found that\r\nhe hung more and more upon Hester\'s smiles: they cheered him, from\r\nwhatever cause they arose.  Margaret was gay from discourse with Philip.\r\nShe had just despatched a letter to him--a letter which had\r\nacknowledged that it was, indeed, long since they had met--that it was\r\nalmost time that he was coming to Deerbrook again.\r\n\r\nThe party they joined looked less merry than themselves.  The two boats\r\nwhich lay at the wharf were gay enough--the one with crimson cushions,\r\nand the other with blue.  A servant-maid was to go in each, to take care\r\nof the provisions, and provide tea at the ruins; and Alice and her\r\ncompanion were alert and smiling.  But Mrs Grey wore a countenance of\r\nextraordinary anxiety; and the twitching of her face showed that\r\nsomething had gone very seriously wrong.  Sophia nearly turned her back\r\nupon Mr Walcot, who continued to address her with patient diligence.\r\nMaria was sitting on some deals, waiting to be called to enter the boat;\r\nand some of the people of the village were staring at her from a little\r\ndistance.  Margaret immediately joined her.\r\n\r\n"What are those people looking at you for?"\r\n\r\n"I cannot conceive.  I fancied that while I was sitting I looked pretty\r\nmuch like other people."\r\n\r\n"To be sure you do.  I will ask Mr Grey.  I am sure there is some\r\nmeaning in their gaze--so ridiculously compassionate."\r\n\r\n"Do not you know?" said Mr Grey.  "Do not you know the story they have\r\ngot up about Miss Young\'s case.  They say Mr Hope set her limb so badly\r\nthat he had to break it again twice.  I have been asked several times\r\nwhether he did not get me to help him: and they will not believe me when\r\nI deny the whole."\r\n\r\nMaria laughed; and Margaret observed that they would presently see how\r\nmuch better Maria could walk now than she did before her last accident,\r\nsuch being the effect of the long and complete rest which had been\r\nenforced upon her.\r\n\r\n"Nothing like seeing for themselves," observed Mr Grey, surveying the\r\ncompany.  "All come but Dr Levitt now, I think.  It really goes to my\r\nheart not to take some of my partner\'s children.  There they are,\r\npeeping at us, one head behind another, from that gate.  There is room\r\nfor two or three, from the Jameses failing us at the last.  The little\r\nthings might as well go; but I suppose there would be no use in saying\r\nanything about it.  I must have a word with my daughter before we\r\nembark.  Sophia, my dear!  Sophia!"\r\n\r\nSophia came, and Margaret overheard her father say to her, that every\r\nperson present was his guest, and to be treated with the civility and\r\nattention due to him as such.  Sophia looked rather sulky at hearing\r\nthis, and walked far away from Mr Walcot to devote herself to Miss\r\nAnderson.\r\n\r\nBy dint of sending a messenger to Dr Levitt\'s a quarter of an hour\r\nbefore the time, his presence was secured a quarter of an hour after it.\r\nHe made his usual approach--looking bland and gentlemanly, and fearing\r\nhe was late.\r\n\r\nThe party were ordered into the boats as if they had been going to\r\ndinner.  Mr Walcot was appointed to hand Margaret in; but he showed,\r\namidst great simplicity, an entire determination to be Sophia\'s\r\ncompanion.  Hope was approaching Maria\'s seat, to give her his arm, when\r\nsome bustle was heard at the gate where the little Rowlands were\r\nclustered.\r\n\r\n"There is my partner!  He will go with us, after all," said Mr Grey.\r\n"Come, my dear sir, we have plenty of room."\r\n\r\n"So much the better for my brother-in-law.  You have room for Enderby,\r\nhave you?  He will be delighted to join you, I have no doubt.  Room for\r\nme too?  I really think I must indulge myself.  Yes; Enderby took us\r\nquite by surprise this morning: but that is his way, you know."\r\n\r\nPhilip here, and without notice!  Margaret thought she was dreaming the\r\nwords she heard.  She felt much oppressed--as if there must be something\r\nwrong in so sudden and strange a proceeding.  At the very moment of\r\nsuspense, she caught Mrs Grey\'s eye fixed upon her with the saddest\r\nexpression she thought she had ever seen.\r\n\r\nPhilip was come--it was no dream.  He was presently in the midst of the\r\nparty, making his compliments--compliments paid to Margaret in a manner\r\nscarcely different in the eyes of others from those which were shared by\r\nall: but to her, a world of wonder and of horror was revealed by the\r\nglance of the eye and the quiver of the lip, too slight to be detected\r\nby any eye less intently fixed than hers.  Margaret stood alone, as the\r\nothers were stepping into the boats; but Philip did not approach her.\r\nHe interfered between Hope and Maria Young.  Maria looked agitated and\r\nuncertain; but she thought she had no right to cause any delay or\r\ndifficulty; and she took his arm, though she felt herself unable to\r\nconceal her trembling.  Hope saw that Margaret was scarcely able to\r\nsupport herself.\r\n\r\n"I cannot go," she said, as he drew her arm within his.  "Leave me\r\nbehind.  They will not miss me.  Nobody will miss me."\r\n\r\nThe agonised tone of these last words brought back the colour which Hope\r\nhad lost in the tempest of emotions, in which anger was uppermost.  He\r\nwas no longer deadly pale when he said:\r\n\r\n"Impossible.  I cannot leave you.  You must not stay behind.  It is of\r\nthe utmost consequence that you should go.  Cannot you?  Do try.  I will\r\nplace you beside Mrs Grey.  Cannot you make the effort?"\r\n\r\nShe did make the effort.  With desperate steadiness she stepped into the\r\nboat where Mrs Grey was seated.  She was conscious that Philip watched\r\nto see what she would do, and then seated Maria and himself in the other\r\nboat.  Hope followed Margaret.  If he had been in the same boat with\r\nEnderby, the temptation to throw him overboard would have been too\r\nstrong.\r\n\r\nTill they were past the weir and the lock, and all the erections\r\nbelonging to the village, and to the great firm which dignified it, the\r\nboats were rowed.  Conversation went on.  The grey church steeple was\r\npronounced picturesque, as it rose above the trees; and the children\r\nlooked up at Dr Levitt, as if the credit of it by some means belonged\r\nto him, the rector.  Sydney desired his younger sisters not to trail\r\ntheir hands through the water, as it retarded the passage of the boat.\r\nThe precise distance of the ruins from Deerbrook ferry was argued, and\r\nDr Levitt gave some curious traditions about the old abbey they were\r\ngoing to see.  Then towing took the place of rowing, and the party\r\nbecame very quiet.  The boat cut steadily through the still waters, the\r\nslight ripple at the bows being the only sound which marked its\r\nprogress.  Dr Levitt pointed with his stick to the "verdurous wall"\r\nwhich sprang up from the brink of the river, every spray of the beech,\r\nevery pyramid of the larch, every leaf of the oak, and the tall column\r\nof the occasional poplar, reflected true as the natural magic of light\r\nand waters could make them.  Some then wished the sun would come out,\r\nwithout which it could scarcely be called seeing the woods.  Others\r\ntried to recognise the person who stood fishing under the great ash; and\r\nit took a minute or two to settle whether it was a man or a boy; and two\r\nminutes more to decide that it was nobody belonging to Deerbrook.\r\nMargaret almost wondered that Edward could talk on about these things as\r\nhe did--so much in his common tone and manner.  But for his ease and\r\nsteadiness in small talk, she should suppose he was striving to have her\r\nleft unnoticed, to look down into the water as strenuously as she\r\npleased.  She little knew what a training he had had in wearing his\r\nusual manner while his heart was wretched.\r\n\r\n"There, now!" cried Fanny, "we have passed the place--the place where\r\ncousin Margaret fell in last winter.  We wanted to have gone directly\r\nover it."\r\n\r\nMargaret looked up, and caught Sydney\'s awe-struck glance.  He had not\r\nyet recovered from that day.\r\n\r\n"If you had mentioned it sooner," said Margaret, "I could have shown you\r\nthe very place.  We did pass directly over it."\r\n\r\n"Oh, why did you not tell us?  You should have told us."\r\n\r\nDr Levitt smiled as he remarked that he thought Miss Ibbotson was\r\nlikely to be the last person to point out that spot to other people, as\r\nwell as to forget it herself.  Margaret had indeed been far from\r\nforgetting it.  She had looked down into its depths, and had brought\r\nthence something that had been useful to her--something on which she was\r\nmeditating when Fanny spoke.  She had been saved, and doubtless for a\r\npurpose.  If it was only to suffer for her own part, and to find no rest\r\nand peace but in devoting herself to others--this was a high purpose.\r\nMaria could live, and was thankful to live, without home, or family, or\r\nprospect.  But it was not certain that this was all that was to be done\r\nand enjoyed in life.  Something dreadful had happened: but Philip loved\r\nher: he still loved her--for nothing but agonised love could have\r\ninspired the glance which yet thrilled through her.  There was some\r\nmistake--some fearful mistake; and the want of confidence in her which\r\nit revealed--the fault of temper in him--opened a long perspective of\r\nmisery; but yet, he loved her, and all was not over.  At times she felt\r\ncertain that Mrs Rowland was at the bottom of this new injury: but it\r\nwas inconceivable that Philip should be deluded by her, after his\r\nwarnings, and his jealous fears lest his Margaret should give heed to\r\nany of his sister\'s misrepresentations.  No light shone upon the\r\nquestion, from the cloudy sky above, or the clear waters beneath; but\r\nboth yielded comfort through that gentle law by which things eminently\r\nreal--Providence, the mercy of death, and the blessing of godlike life,\r\nare presented or prophesied to the spirit by the shadows amidst which we\r\nlive.  When Margaret spoke, there was a calmness in her voice, so like\r\nan echo of comfort in her heart, that it almost made Edward start.\r\n\r\nThe party in the other boat were noisier, whether or not they were\r\nhappier, than those in whose wake they followed.  Mr Walcot had begun\r\nto be inspired as soon as the oars had made their first splash, and was\r\nnow reciting to Sophia some "Lines to the Setting Sun," which he had\r\nlearned when a little boy, and had never forgotten.  He asked her\r\nwhether it was not a sweet idea--that of the declining sun being like a\r\ngood man going to his rest, to rise again to-morrow morning.  Sophia was\r\nfond of poetry that was not too difficult; and she found little\r\ndisinclination in herself now to observe her father\'s directions about\r\nbeing civil to Mr Walcot.  The gentleman perceived that he had won some\r\nadvantage; and he persevered.  He next spoke of the amiable poet,\r\nCowper, and was delighted to find that Miss Grey was acquainted with\r\nsome of his writings; that she had at one time been able to repeat his\r\npiece on a Poplar Field, and those sweet lines beginning--\r\n\r\n  "The rose had been washed, just washed in a shower."\r\n\r\nBut she had never heard the passage about "the twanging horn o\'er yonder\r\nbridge," and "the wheeling the sofa round," and "the cups that cheer but\r\nnot inebriate;" so Mr Walcot repeated them, not, as before, in a high\r\nkey, and with his face turned up towards the sky, but almost in a\r\nwhisper, and inclining towards her ear.  Sophia sighed, and thought it\r\nvery beautiful, and was sorry for people who were not fond of poetry.  A\r\npause of excited feeling followed, during which they found that the\r\ngentlemen were questioning a boatman, who was awaiting his turn to tow,\r\nabout the swans in the river.\r\n\r\n"The swans have much increased in number this season, surely.  Those are\r\nall of one family, I suppose--those about the island," observed Mr\r\nGrey.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir; they can\'t abide neighbours.  They won\'t suffer a nest within\r\na mile."\r\n\r\n"They fight it out, if they approach too near, eh?" said Enderby.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir; they leave one another for dead.  I have lost some of the\r\nfinest swans under my charge in that way."\r\n\r\n"Do you not part them when they fight?" asked Walcot.\r\n\r\n"I would.  I always part little boys whom I see fighting in the streets,\r\nand tell them they should not quarrel."\r\n\r\n"You would repent meddling with the swans, sir, if you tried.  When I\r\nknew no better, I meddled once, and I thought I should hardly get away\r\nalive.  One of the creatures flapped my arm so hard, that I thought more\r\nthan once it was broken.  I would advise you, sir, never to go near\r\nswans when they are angry."\r\n\r\n"You will find ample employment for your peace-making talents among the\r\nDeerbrook people, Mr Walcot," said Philip.  "They may break your\r\nwindows, and perhaps your heart; but they will leave you your eyes and\r\nyour right arm.  For my part, I do not know but I had rather do battle\r\nwith the swans."\r\n\r\n"Better not, sir," said the boatman.  "I would advise you never to go\r\nnear swans when they are angry."\r\n\r\n"Look!" said Sophia, anxiously.  "Is not this one angry?  Yes, it is: I\r\nam sure it is!  Did you ever see anything like its feathers? and it is\r\ncoming this way, it is just upon us!  Oh, Mr Walcot!"\r\n\r\nSophia threw herself over to the other side of the boat, and Mr Walcot\r\nstarted up, looking very pale.\r\n\r\n"Sit down!" cried Mr Grey, in his loudest voice.  Mr Walcot sat down\r\nas if shot; and Sophia crept back to her place, with an anxious glance\r\nat the retreating bird.  Of course, the two young people were\r\nplentifully lectured about shifting their places in a boat without\r\nleave, and were asked the question, more easily put than answered, how\r\nthey should have felt if they had been the means of precipitating the\r\nwhole party into the water.  Then there was a calling out from the other\r\nboat to know what was the matter, and an explanation; so that Sophia and\r\nMr Walcot had to take refuge in mutual sympathy from universal censure.\r\n\r\n"The birds always quarrel with the boats--boats of this make," explained\r\nthe boatman; "because their enemies go out in skiffs to take them.  They\r\nlet a lighter pass without taking any notice, while they always scour\r\nthe water near a skiff; but I never heard of their flying at a pleasure\r\nparty in any sort of boat."\r\n\r\n"Where are the black swans that a sea-captain brought to Lady Hunter?"\r\nasked Philip.  "I see nothing of them."\r\n\r\n"The male died; choked, sir,--with a crust of bread a stranger gave him.\r\nBut for that, he would have been now in sight, I don\'t doubt; for he\r\nprospered very well till that day."\r\n\r\n"Of a crust of bread!  What a death!" exclaimed Philip.  "And the\r\nother?"\r\n\r\n"She died, sir, by the visitation of God," replied the boatman,\r\nsolemnly.\r\n\r\nIt was obviously so far from the man\'s intention that any one should\r\nlaugh, that nobody did laugh.  Maria observed to her next neighbour\r\nthat, to a keeper of swans, his birds were more companionable, and quite\r\nas important, as their human charge to coroners and jurymen.\r\n\r\nThe boat got aground amongst the flags, at a point where the tow-rope\r\nhad to be carried over a foot-bridge at some little distance inland.\r\nOne of the men, in attempting to leap the ditch, had fallen in, and\r\nemerged dripping with mud.  Ben jumped ashore to take his turn at the\r\nrope, and Enderby pushed the boat off again with an oar, with some\r\nlittle effort.  Mr Walcot had squeezed Sophia\'s parasol so hard, during\r\nthe crisis, as to break its ivory ring.  The accident, mortifying as it\r\nwas to him, did not prevent his exclaiming in a fervour of gratitude,\r\nwhen the vibration of the boat was over, and they were once more\r\nafloat--\r\n\r\n"What an exceedingly clever man Mr Enderby is!"\r\n\r\n"Extremely clever.  I really think he can do everything."\r\n\r\n"Ah! he would not have managed to break the ring of your parasol, as I\r\nhave been so awkward as to do.  But I will see about getting it mended\r\nto-morrow.  If I were as clever as Mr Enderby now, I might be able to\r\nmend it myself."\r\n\r\n"You will not be able to get another ring in Deerbrook.  But never mind.\r\nI beg you will not feel uncomfortable about it.  I can fasten it with a\r\nloop of green ribbon and a button till the next time I go to Blickley.\r\nPray do not feel uncomfortable."\r\n\r\n"How can I help it?  You say there is no ring in Deerbrook.  Not any\r\nsort of ring?  My dear Miss Grey, if I cannot repair this sort of\r\nring--"\r\n\r\nSophia was a good deal flurried.  She begged he would think no more of\r\nthe parasol; it was no manner of consequence.\r\n\r\n"Do not be too good to me," whispered he.  "I trust.  I know my duty\r\nbetter than to take you at your word.  From my earliest years, my\r\nparents have instilled into me the duty of making reparation for the\r\ninjuries we cause to others."\r\n\r\nSophia gave him an affecting look of approbation, and asked with much\r\ninterest where his parents lived, and how many brothers and sisters he\r\nhad; and assured him, at last, that she saw he belonged to a charming\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\n"It does not become me to speak proudly of such near relations," said\r\nhe; "and one who has so lately left the parental roof is, perhaps,\r\nscarcely to be trusted to be impartial; but I will say for my family\r\nthat, though not perhaps so clever as Mrs Rowland and Mr Enderby--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, for Heaven\'s sake, do not name them together!"\r\n\r\nMr Walcot saw that he had broken the charm: he hastened to repair the\r\nmischief which one unhappy name had caused.\r\n\r\n"It is natural, I know, that you should take the most interest in that\r\nmember of the family who is to be your relation.  You consider him in\r\nthat light, I believe?"\r\n\r\n"Of course.  He is to be our cousin."\r\n\r\n"The parties wish it to be kept a secret, I conclude," said he, glancing\r\nat Enderby, and then stretching back as far as he thought safe, to look\r\nat the other boat.\r\n\r\n"Oh dear, no!  There is no secret about the matter."\r\n\r\n"I should not have supposed them to be engaged, by their manner to each\r\nother.  Perhaps it is off," said he, quickly, fixing his eyes upon her.\r\n\r\n"Off!  What an odd idea!  Who ever thought of such a thing?"\r\n\r\n"Such things have been heard of as engagements going off, you know."\r\n\r\nBoth had raised their voices during the last few eager sentences.\r\nSophia became aware that they had been overheard, by seeing the deep\r\nflush which overspread Miss Young\'s pale face.  Philip looked at Mr\r\nWalcot as if he would have knocked him down, if they had only been on\r\nland.  The young man took off his hat, and ran his fingers through his\r\nwhite hair, for the sake of something to do: replaced his hat, and shook\r\nhis head manfully, as if to settle his heart in his breast, as well as\r\nhis beaver on his crown.  He glanced down the river, in hopes that the\r\nabbey was not yet too near.  It was important to him that the wrath of\r\nso extremely clever a man as Mr Enderby should have subsided before the\r\nparty went on shore.\r\n\r\nIt would have been a strange thing to have known how many of that\r\ncompany were dreading to reach the object of their excursion.  A thrill\r\npassed through many hearts when the ruins, with their overshadowing ivy,\r\nwere at length discerned, seated in the meadow to which the boats seemed\r\napproaching far too rapidly.  In the bustle of landing, however, it was\r\neasy for those who wished to avoid one another to do so.\r\n\r\nMost of the guests walked straight up to the abbey walls, to examine all\r\nthat was left of them.  Mrs Grey and her maids went to the little\r\nfarmhouse which was at one corner of the old building, and chiefly\r\nconstructed out of its ruins; and while the parties on whom the cares of\r\nhospitality devolved were consulting with the farmer\'s wife about\r\npreparations for tea, any stray guest might search for wood-plants in\r\nthe skirts of the copse on the hill behind, or talk with the children\r\nwho were jumping in and out of an old saw-pit in the wood, or if\r\ncontemplative, might watch the minnows in the brook, which was here\r\nrunning parallel with the river.\r\n\r\nMrs Grey obviously considered that Margaret was her peculiar charge.\r\nShe spoke little to her; but when Philip was off somewhere, she took her\r\narm, and seemed to insist on her company when she proceeded to her\r\ntreaty with the dame of the farm.  Margaret stood for some time\r\npatiently, while they discussed whether it should be tea in the\r\nfarmhouse parlour, which was too small--or tea in the meadow, which\r\nmight be damp--or tea in the ruins, where there might be draughts, and\r\nthe water could not be supplied hot.  Before this matter was settled,\r\nMargaret saw that her friend Maria was seated on a log beside the brook,\r\nand gazing wistfully at her.  Margaret tried to disengage her arm from\r\nMrs Grey; Mrs Grey objected.\r\n\r\n"Wait a moment, my dear.  I will not detain you five minutes.  You must\r\nnot go anywhere without me, my dear child."\r\n\r\nNever before had Mrs Grey spoken to Margaret with tenderness like this.\r\nMargaret was resolved to know why now; but she would first speak to\r\nMaria.  She said she would return presently: she wished to return: but\r\nshe must speak to Maria.\r\n\r\n"Margaret, what is all this?" said Maria, in a voice whose agitation she\r\ncould not control.  "Have I been doing wrong?  Am I now thinking what is\r\nwrong?  I did not know whether to be angry with him or not.  I was\r\nafraid to speak to him, and afraid not to speak to him.  How is it? tell\r\nme, Margaret."\r\n\r\n"I wish I could," said Margaret, in a tone calmer than her friend\'s.  "I\r\nam in a miserable dream.  I wrote to him this morning."\r\n\r\n"To London?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, to London.  He must have been in Deerbrook while I was writing it.\r\nI heard from him, as usual, three days ago; and since then, I have\r\nnever had a line or a word to prepare me for this.  There is some\r\ndreadful mistake."\r\n\r\n"The mistake is not his, I fear," said Maria, her eyes filling as she\r\nspoke.  "The mistake is yours, Margaret, and mine, and everybody\'s who\r\ntook a selfish man of the world for a being with a heart and a\r\nconscience."\r\n\r\n"You are wrong, Maria.  You go too far.  You will find that you are\r\nunjust.  He is as wretched as I am.  There is some mistake which may be\r\nexplained: for he... he loves me, I am certain.  But I wish I was\r\nanywhere but here--it is so wretched!"\r\n\r\n"I am afraid I have done wrong in speaking with him at all," said Maria.\r\n"I longed for three words with you; for I did not know what I ought to\r\ndo.  We must learn something before we return.  Your friends must act\r\nfor you.  Where is Mr Hope?"\r\n\r\n"I do not know.  Everybody deserts me, I think."\r\n\r\n"I will not.  It is little I can do; but stay by me: do not leave me.  I\r\nwill watch for you."\r\n\r\nMargaret fell into the common error of the wretched, when she said these\r\nlast words.  Her brother was at work on her behalf.  Hope had gone\r\ntowards the ruins with the rest of the party, to keep his eye on\r\nEnderby.  Sophia hung on his arm, which she had taken that she might\r\nrelieve herself of some thoughts which she could not so well speak to\r\nany one of the strangers of the party.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr Hope!" cried she, "how very much mistaken we have been in Mr\r\nWalcot all this time!  He is a most delightful young man--so refined!\r\nand so domestic!"\r\n\r\n"Indeed!  You will trust Sydney\'s judgment more readily another time."\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed.  But I could not help telling you.  I know you will not be\r\noffended; though some people, perhaps, would not venture to speak so to\r\nyou; but I know you will excuse it, and not be offended."\r\n\r\n"So far from being offended, I like what you now say far better than the\r\nway I have heard you sometimes speak of Mr Walcot.  I have thought\r\nbefore that you did not allow him fair play.  Now, in my turn, I must\r\nask you not to be offended with me."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I never could be offended with you; you are always so good and\r\namiable.  Mamma seemed a little vexed when you encouraged Sydney to\r\npraise Mr Walcot: but she will be delighted at your opinion of him,\r\nwhen she finds how accomplished he is--and so refined!"\r\n\r\n"You speak of my opinion.  I have no opinion about Mr Walcot yet,\r\nbecause I do not know him.  You must remember that, though all Deerbrook\r\nhas been busy about him since May, I have scarcely heard him say five\r\nwords.  I do not speak as having any opinion of him, one way or another.\r\nHow dark this place looks to-day!--that aisle--how gloomy!"\r\n\r\n"I think it is the weather.  There is no sun; and the ivy tosses about\r\nstrangely.  What do you think of the weather?"\r\n\r\n"I think we shall have the least possible benefit of the moon.  How like\r\na solid wall those clouds look, low down in the sky!--Here comes Mr\r\nWalcot.  Suppose you let him take you after the rest of the party?  You\r\nwill not like the gloom of that aisle where I am going."\r\n\r\nBoth Sophia and Mr Walcot much preferred each other\'s company to the\r\ndamp and shadow of the interior of the abbey.  They walked off together,\r\nand gathered meadow flowers, and admired poetry and poets till all were\r\nsummoned, and they were compelled to join the groups who were converging\r\nfrom copse, brook, poultry-yard, and cloister, towards the green before\r\nthe farmhouse, where, after all, the long tea-table was spread.\r\n\r\nThe reason of Hope\'s anxiety to consign Sophia to Mr Walcot\'s charge\r\nwas, that he saw Enderby pacing the aisle alone with rapid steps, his\r\nface hung with gloom as deep as darkened the walls about him.\r\n\r\n"Enderby, are you mad?" cried Hope, hastening in to him.\r\n\r\n"I believe I am.  As you are aware, no man has better cause."\r\n\r\n"I wait your explanation.  Till I have it, your conduct is a perfect\r\nmystery.  To Margaret, or to me for her, you must explain yourself, and\r\nthat immediately.  In the mean time, I do not know how to address you--\r\nhow to judge you."\r\n\r\n"Then Mrs Grey has not told you of our conversation of this morning?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Hope, his heart suddenly failing him.\r\n\r\n"The whole dreadful story has become known to me; and I am thankful that\r\nit is revealed before it is too late.  My sister is sometimes right,\r\nhowever she may be often wrong.  She has done me a cruel kindness now.\r\nI know all, Hope;--how you loved Margaret;--how, when it was too late,\r\nyou discovered that Margaret loved you;--how, when I burst in upon you\r\nand her, she was (Oh, why did I ever see her again?) she was learning\r\nfrom you the absurd resolution which Mrs Grey had been urging upon you,\r\nby working upon your false sense of honour--a sense of honour of which I\r\nam to have none of the benefit, since, after marrying the one sister out\r\nof compassion and to please Mrs Grey, you turn the other over to me--\r\ninnocent in soul and conscience, I know, but no longer with virgin\r\naffections--you give her to me for your mutual security and\r\nconsolation."\r\n\r\n"Enderby! you _are_ mad," cried Hope, his strength being roused by this\r\nextent of accusation from the depression caused by the mixture of truth\r\nin the dreadful words Philip had just spoken.  "But mad, deluded, or\r\nwicked--however you may have been wrought into this state of mind, there\r\nare two things which must be said on the instant, and regarded by you in\r\nall coming time.  These charges, as they relate to myself, had better be\r\nspoken of at another opportunity, and when you are in a calmer state of\r\nmind: but meanwhile I, as a husband, forbid you to speak lightly of my\r\nbeloved and honoured wife: and I also charge you, as you revere the\r\npurity of Margaret\'s soul--of the innocent soul and conscience of which\r\nyou speak--that you do not convey to her, by the remotest intimation,\r\nany conception of the horrible tale with which some wretch has been\r\ndeluding you.  She never loved any one but you.  If you pollute and\r\nagonise her imagination with these vile fancies of your sister\'s, (for\r\nfrom whom else can such inventions come?) remember that you peril the\r\npeace of an innocent family; you poison the friendship of sisters whom\r\nbereavement has bound to each other; and deprive Margaret of all that\r\nlife contains for her.  You will not impair my wife\'s faith in me, I am\r\nconfident; but you may turn Margaret\'s brain, if you say to her anything\r\nlike what passed your lips just now.  It seems but a short time,\r\nEnderby, since we committed Margaret\'s happiness to your care; and now I\r\nhave to appeal on her behalf to your honour and conscience."\r\n\r\n"Mrs Grey, Mrs Grey," Enderby repeated, fixing his eyes upon Hope\'s\r\ncountenance.\r\n\r\n"The quarrel between you and me shall be attended to in its turn,\r\nEnderby.  I must first secure my wife and Margaret from any rashness on\r\nyour part.  If you put distrust between them, and pollute their home by\r\nthe wildest of fancies, it would be better for you that these walls\r\nshould fall upon us, and bury us both."\r\n\r\n"Oh, that they would!" cried Philip.  "I am sick of living in the midst\r\nof treachery.  Life is a waste to a man treated as I have been."\r\n\r\n"Answer me, Enderby--answer me this instant," Hope cried, advancing to\r\nplace himself between Enderby and Margaret, whom he saw now entering the\r\nruin, and rapidly approaching them.\r\n\r\n"You are right," said Enderby, aloud.  "You may trust me."\r\n\r\n"Philip, what am I to think?" said Margaret, walking quite up to him,\r\nand looking intently in his face.  "I hardly know whether we are living,\r\nand in our common world."  Hope shuddered to see the glance she cast\r\nround the dreary place.  Philip half turned away and did not speak.\r\n\r\n"Why will not you speak?  What reason can there be for this silence?\r\nWhen you last left me, you feared your sister might make mischief\r\nbetween us; and then I promised that if such a thing could happen as\r\nthat I should doubt you, I would tell you my doubt as soon as I was\r\naware of it myself; and now you are angry with me--you would strike me\r\ndead this moment, if you dared--and you will not speak."\r\n\r\n"Go now, Margaret," said Hope, gently.  "He cannot speak to you now:\r\ntake my word for it that he cannot."\r\n\r\n"I will not go.  I will take nobody\'s word.  What are you, Edward,\r\nbetween me and him?  It is my right to know how I have offended him.  I\r\nrequire no more than my right.  I do not ask him to love me; nor need I,\r\nfor he loves me still--I know it and feel it."\r\n\r\n"It is true," said Enderby, mournfully gazing upon her agitated\r\ncountenance, but retreating as he gazed.\r\n\r\n"I do not ask to be yours, any farther than I am now--now when our\r\naffections are true, and our word is broken.  But I do insist upon your\r\nesteem, as far as I have ever possessed it.  I have done nothing to\r\nforfeit it; and I demand your reasons for supposing that I have."\r\n\r\n"Not now," said Philip, faintly, shrinking in the presence of the two\r\nconcerning whom he entertained so painful a complexity of feelings.\r\nThere stood Hope, firm as the pillar behind him.  There stood Margaret,\r\nagitated, but unabashed as the angels that come in dreams.  Was it\r\npossible that these two had loved?  Could they then stand before him\r\nthus?  But Mrs Grey--what she admitted!--this, in confirmation with\r\nother evidence, could not be cast aside.  Yet Philip dared not speak,\r\nfearing to injure beyond reparation.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Margaret, not now!" he faintly repeated.  "My heart is almost\r\nbroken!  Give me time."\r\n\r\n"You have given me none.  Let that pass, however.  But I cannot give you\r\ntime.  I cannot hold out--who can hold out, under injurious secrecy--\r\nunder mocking injustice--under torturing doubt from the one who is\r\npledged to the extreme of confidence?  Let us once understand one\r\nanother, and we will never meet more, and I will endure whatever must be\r\nendured, and we shall have time--Oh, what a weary time!--to learn to\r\nsubmit.  But not till you have given me the confidence you owe--the last\r\nI shall ever ask from you--will I endure one moment\'s suspense.  I will\r\nnot give you time."\r\n\r\n"Yes, Margaret, you will--you must," said Hope.  "It is hard, very hard;\r\nbut Enderby is so far right."\r\n\r\n"God help me, for every one is against me!" cried Margaret, sinking down\r\namong the long grass, and laying her throbbing head upon the cold stone.\r\n"He comes without notice to terrify me by his anger--me whom he loves\r\nabove all the world; he leaves my heart to break with his unkindness in\r\nthe midst of all these indifferent people; he denies me the explanation\r\nI demand; and you--you of all others, tell me he is right!  I will do\r\nwithout protection, since the two who owe it forsake me: but God is my\r\nwitness how you wrong me."\r\n\r\n"Enderby, why do not you go?" said Hope, sternly.  Almost before the\r\nwords were spoken, Enderby had disappeared at the further end of the\r\naisle.\r\n\r\n"Patience, Margaret!  A little patience, my dear sister.  All may be\r\nwell; all must be well for such as you; but I mean that I trust all may\r\nbe repaired.  He has been wrought upon by some bad influence--"\r\n\r\n"Then all is over.  If, knowing me as he did--.  But, Edward, do not\r\nspeak to me.  Go: leave me!  I cannot speak another word now--"\r\n\r\n"I cannot leave you here.  This is no place for you.  Think of your\r\nsister, Margaret.  You will do nothing to alarm her.  If she were to see\r\nyou now--."\r\n\r\nMargaret raised herself; took her brother\'s arm, and went out into the\r\nair.  No one was near.\r\n\r\n"Now leave me, brother.  I must be alone.  I will walk here, and think\r\nwhat I must do.  But how can I know, when all is made such a mystery?\r\nOh, brother, tell me what I ought to do!"\r\n\r\n"Calm yourself now.  Command yourself; for this day.  You, innocent as\r\nyou are, may well do so.  If I had such a conscience as yours--if I were\r\nonly in your place, Margaret--if I had nothing to bear but wrongs, I\r\nwould thank Heaven as Heaven was never yet thanked."\r\n\r\n"You, Edward!"\r\n\r\n"If the universe heaped injuries upon me, they should not crush me.  If\r\nI had a self-respect like yours, I would lift my head to the stars."\r\n\r\n"You, Edward!"\r\n\r\n"Margaret, wretched as you are, your misery is nothing to mine.  Have\r\npity upon me, and command yourself.  For my sake and your sister\'s, look\r\nand act like yourself, and hope peacefully, trust steadily, that all\r\nwill yet be right."\r\n\r\n"It cannot be that you have wronged me, brother.  You sent him from me,\r\nI know; and that was unkind: but you could never really wrong any one."\r\n\r\n"I never meant it.  I honour you, and would protect you--I will protect\r\nyou as a brother should.  Only do not say again that you are forsaken.\r\nIt would break our hearts to hear you say that again."\r\n\r\n"I will not.  And I will try to be for to-day as if nothing had\r\nhappened: but I promise no more than to endeavour--I am so bewildered!"\r\n\r\n"Then I will leave you.  I shall not be far off.  No one shall come to\r\ndisturb you."\r\n\r\nThere is, perhaps, no mood of mind in which it is impossible for the\r\nsweet ministrations of nature to be accepted.  Even now, as Margaret\r\nstood on the river-bank, the influences of the scene flowed in upon her.\r\nThe operations of thought were quickened, and she was presently\r\nconvinced that the next time she saw Philip she should learn all--she\r\nmight even find him repentant for having been weak and credulous.\r\nEdward\'s self-reproach was the most inexplicable mystery of all.  In his\r\nbrotherly grief he had no doubt exaggerated some slight carelessness of\r\nspeech, some deficiency of watchfulness and zeal.  Hester must never\r\nknow of these sorrowful things that Edward had said.  There was\r\nsubstantial comfort in other of his words.  It was true that she was\r\nonly wronged.  In her former season of wretchedness, it had been far\r\nworse: there was not only disappointment, but humiliation; loss, not\r\nonly of hope, but of self-respect.  Now, she was innocent of any wrong\r\ntowards Philip and herself; and, in this consciousness, any lot must be\r\nsupportable.  While thus musing, she walked slowly along, sighing away\r\nsome of her oppression.  Her heart and head throbbed less.  Her eye was\r\ncaught by the little fish that leaped out of the water after the evening\r\nflies: she stood to watch them.  The splash of a water-rat roused her\r\near, and she turned to track him across the stream.  Then she saw a fine\r\nyellow iris, growing among the flags on the very brink, and she must\r\nhave it for Maria.  To reach it without a wetting required some skill\r\nand time.  She tried this way--she tried that; but the flower was just\r\nout of reach.  She went to the next alder-bush for a bough, which\r\nanswered her purpose; and she had drawn the tuft of flags towards her,\r\nand laid hold of the iris, when Sydney shouted her name from a distance,\r\nand summoned her to tea.\r\n\r\nMaria was seated at the table, amidst the greater proportion of the\r\nparty, when Margaret arrived, escorted by Sydney, and followed at a\r\nlittle distance by Mr Hope.  Never had flower been more welcome to\r\nMaria than this iris, offered to her with a smile.  Pale as the face\r\nwas, and heavy as were the eyes, there was a genuine smile.  Maria had\r\nkept a place for Margaret, which she took, though Mrs Grey kept gazing\r\nat her, and assured her that she must sit beside her.  Mr Enderby was\r\nnot to be seen.  Frequent proclamation was made for him; but he did not\r\nappear; and it was settled that if he preferred wood-ranging to good\r\ncheer, he must have his own way.\r\n\r\nTea passed off well enough.  Dr Levitt and Mr Hope went over the\r\nsubject of the abbey again, for the benefit of the rearward portion of\r\nthe company, who had not heard it before.  Mr Rowland and the farmer\r\ndiscussed the bad crops.  Sophia spilled her tea, from Mr Walcot having\r\nmade her laugh when she was carrying the cup to her lips; and Sydney\r\ncollected a portion of every good thing that was on the table for Mr\r\nEnderby to enjoy on his return.\r\n\r\nMr Enderby did not return till it was quite time to be gone.  Mr Grey\r\nhad long been hurrying the servants in their business of packing up\r\nplates and spoons.  He even offered help, and repeated his cautions to\r\nhis guests not to stray beyond call.  The farmer shook his head as he\r\nlooked up at the leaden-coloured sky, across which black masses of\r\ncloud, like condensed smoke, were whirled, and prophesied a stormy\r\nnight.  There was no time to be lost.  The boatmen came bustling out of\r\nthe farm-kitchen, still munching; and they put the boats in trim with\r\nall speed, while the ladies stood on the bank quite ready to step in.\r\nMrs Grey assorted the two parties, still claiming Margaret for her own\r\nboat, but allowing Maria to enter instead of Sydney.  Hope chose to\r\nremain with them; so Dr Levitt exchanged with Sophia.  Mr Walcot\r\nthought there was a lion in his path either way--Mr Hope, his\r\nprofessional rival, in one boat, and Mr Enderby, whom he fancied he had\r\noffended, in the other.  He adhered to Sophia, as a sure ally.\r\n\r\n"Mr Enderby!  Where can he be?" was the exclamation, when all were\r\nseated, and the boatmen stood ready to start, with the tow-rope about\r\ntheir shoulders; when the dame of the farm had made her parting curtsey,\r\nand had stepped a few paces backward, after her swimming obeisance.  The\r\nfarmer was running over the meadow towards the copse in search of the\r\nmissing gentleman, and Sydney would have sprung out of the boat to join\r\nin the chase, when his father laid a strong hand on him, and said that\r\none stray member of a party on a threatening evening was enough.  He\r\ncould not have people running after one another till the storm came on.\r\nMr Rowland was full of concern, and would have had Sydney throw away\r\nthe basketful of good things he had hoarded for his friend.  If Enderby\r\nchose to absent himself for his own enjoyments, Mr Rowland said, he\r\ncould not expect to share other people\'s.  Hope was standing up in the\r\nfirst boat, gazing anxiously round, and Margaret\'s eyes were fixed on\r\nhis face, when every body cried out at once, "Here he is! here he\r\ncomes!" and Enderby was seen leaping through a gap in the farthest\r\nhedge, and bounding over the meadow.  He sprang into the boat with a\r\nforce which set it rocking, and made the ladies catch at whatever could\r\nbe grasped.\r\n\r\n"Your hat!" exclaimed several voices.\r\n\r\n"Why, Mr Enderby, where is your hat?" cried Sydney, laughing.  Enderby\r\nclapped his hand on the top of his head, and declared he did not know.\r\nHe had not missed his hat till this moment.\r\n\r\nHope called from the first boat to the farmer, and asked him to look in\r\nthe aisle of the abbey for the gentleman\'s hat.  It was brought thence;\r\nand Fanny and Mary laughed at Mr Hope for being such a good guesser as\r\nto fancy where Mr Enderby\'s hat might be, when Mr Enderby did not know\r\nhimself.  The moment the hat was tossed into the lap of its owner, Mr\r\nGrey\'s voice was heard shouting to the men--\r\n\r\n"Start off, and get us home as soon as you can."\r\n\r\nThe men gave a glance at the sky, and set forth at a smart pace.  Mr\r\nGrey saw that the umbrellas lay at his hand, ready for distribution, and\r\nadvised each lady to draw her cloak about her, as the air felt to him\r\ndamp and chill.\r\n\r\nA general flatness being perceptible, some one proposed that somebody\r\nelse should sing.  All declined at first, however, except Maria, whose\r\nvoice was always most ready when it was most difficult to sing--when the\r\nparty was dull, or when no one else would begin.  She wanted to prevent\r\nMargaret\'s being applied to, and she sang, once and again, on the\r\nslightest hint.  Sophia had no music-books, and could not sing without\r\nthe piano, as every one knew beforehand she would say.  Mrs Grey\r\ndropped a tear to the memory of Mrs Enderby, whose ballad was never\r\nwanting on such occasions as these.  Sydney concluded that it was the\r\nsame thought which made Mr Enderby bury his head in his hat between his\r\nknees while Miss Young was singing.  It could not surely be all from\r\nshame at having kept the party waiting.\r\n\r\nIt was with some uncertainty and awe that he whispered in his friend\'s\r\near--\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you think you could sing your new song that cousin Margaret is so\r\nfond of?  Do: we are all as flat as flounders, and everybody will be\r\nasleep presently if we don\'t do something.  Can\'t you get over a thing\r\nor two, and sing for us?"\r\n\r\n"I am sure I would if I only could."\r\n\r\nEnderby shook his head without raising it from his knees.\r\n\r\nMr Walcot had no idea of refusing when he was asked.  He could sing the\r\nCanadian Boat Song; but he was afraid they might have heard it before.\r\n\r\n"Never mind that.  Let us have it," said everybody.\r\n\r\n"But there should be two: it is a duet, properly, you know."\r\n\r\nSophia believed she could sing that--just that--without the piano.  She\r\nwould try the first part, if he would take the second.  Mr Grey thought\r\nto himself that his daughter seemed to have adopted his hint about\r\ncivility to his guests very dutifully.  But Mr Walcot could sing only\r\nthe first part, because he had a brother at home who always took the\r\nsecond.  He could soon learn it, he had no doubt, but he did not know it\r\nat present: so he had the duet all to himself; uplifting a slender voice\r\nin a very odd key, which Fanny and Mary did not quite know what to make\r\nof.  They looked round into all the faces in their boat to see whether\r\nanyone was going to laugh: but everybody was immoveable, except that\r\nSophia whispered softly to Miss Young, that Mr Walcot was a most\r\ndelightful young man, after all--so accomplished and so refined!\r\n\r\nMr Walcot\'s song ended with a quaver, from a large, cold, startling\r\ndrop of rain falling on his nose, as he closed his eyes to draw out his\r\nlast note.  He blushed at having started and flinched from a drop of\r\nrain, and so spoiled his conclusion.  Some of his hearers supposed he\r\nhad broken-down, till assured by others that he had finished.  Then\r\neverybody thanked him, and agreed that the rain was really coming on.\r\n\r\nThere were now odd fleeces of white cloud between the lead colour and\r\nthe black.  They were hurried about in the sky, evidently by counter\r\ncurrents.  The river was almost inky in its hue, and every large drop\r\nmade its own splash and circle.  Up went the umbrellas in both boats;\r\nbut almost before they were raised, some were turned inside out, and all\r\nwere dragged down again.  The gust had come, and brought with it a pelt\r\nof hail--large hailstones, which fell in at Fanny\'s collar behind, while\r\nshe put down her head to save her face, and which almost took away\r\nMary\'s breath, by coming sharp and fast against her cheeks.  Then\r\nsomebody descried a gleam of lightning quivering in the grey roof of the\r\nsky; and next, every one saw the tremendous flash which blazed over the\r\nsurface of the water, all round about.  How Mr Walcot would have\r\nquavered if he had been singing still.  But a very different voice was\r\nnow to be heard--the hoarse thunder rolling up, like advancing\r\nartillery; first growling, then roaring, and presently crashing and\r\nrattling overhead.  The boatmen\'s thoughts were for the ladies, exposed\r\nas they were, without the possibility of putting up umbrellas.  It felt\r\nalmost dark to those in the boats, as they cut rapidly--more and more\r\nrapidly--through the water which seethed about the bows.  The men were\r\ntrotting, running.  Presently it was darker still: the bent heads were\r\nraised, and it appeared that the boats were brought to, under the wide\r\nbranches of two oaks which overhung the water.  The woods were reached\r\nalready.\r\n\r\n"Shelter for the ladies, sir," said the panting boatmen, touching their\r\nhats, and then taking them off to wipe their brows.  Mr Grey looked\r\ndoubtful, stood up to survey, and then asked if there was no farm, no\r\nsort of house anywhere near.  None nearer than you village where the\r\nspire was, and that was very little nearer than Deerbrook itself.  The\r\nladies who were disposed to say anything, observed that they were very\r\nwell as they were: the tree kept off a great deal of the hail, and the\r\nwind was not felt quite so much as on the open river.  Should they sit\r\nstill, or step on shore?  Sit still, by all means.  Packed closely as\r\nthey were, they would be warmer and drier than standing on shore; and\r\nthey were now ready to start homewards as soon as the storm should\r\nabate.  It did not appear that there was any abatement of the storm in\r\nfive minutes, nor in a quarter of an hour.  The young people looked up\r\nat the elder ones, as if asking what to expect.  Several of the party\r\nhappened to be glancing in the same direction with the boatmen, when\r\nthey saw a shaft of lightning strike perpendicularly from the upper\r\nrange of cloud upon the village spire, and light it up.\r\n\r\n"Lord bless us!" exclaimed Mr Grey, as the spire sent its smoke up like\r\na little volcano.\r\n\r\nFanny burst out a-crying, but was called a silly child, and desired not\r\nto make a noise.  Everyone was silent enough now; most hiding their\r\nfaces, that they might not see what happened next.  Half way between the\r\nriver and the smoking church, in the farther part of the opposite\r\nmeadow, was a fine spreading oak, under which, as might just be seen, a\r\nflock of sheep were huddled together for shelter.  Another fiery dart\r\nshot down from the dark canopy, upon the crown of this oak.  The tree\r\nquivered and fell asunder, its fragments lying in a circle.  There was a\r\nrush forth of such of the sheep as escaped, and a rattle of thunder\r\nwhich would have overpowered any ordinary voices, but in the midst of\r\nwhich a scream was heard from the first boat.  It was a singular thing\r\nthat, in talking over this storm in after-days at home, no lady would\r\nown this scream.\r\n\r\n"I\'m thinking, sir," said Ben, as soon as he could make himself heard,\r\n"we are in a bad place here, as the storm seems thickening this way.  We\r\nhad best get from under the trees, for all the hail."\r\n\r\n"Do so, Ben; and make haste."\r\n\r\nWhen the first boat was brought a little out into the stream, in order\r\nto clear it of the flags, Margaret became aware that Philip was gazing\r\nearnestly at her from the other boat.  She alone of the ladies had sat\r\nwith face upraised, watching the advance of the storm.  She alone,\r\nperhaps, of all the company, had enjoyed it with pure relish.  It had\r\nanimated her mind, and restored her to herself.  When she saw Philip\r\nleaning back on his elbow, almost over the edge of the boat, to\r\ncontemplate her, she returned his gaze with such an expression of\r\nmournful wonder and composed sorrow, as moved him to draw his hat over\r\nhis eyes, and resolve to look no more.\r\n\r\nThe storm abated, but did not cease.  Rain succeeded to hail, lightning\r\nstill hovered in the air, and thunder continued to growl afar off.  But\r\nthe umbrellas could now be kept up, and the ladies escaped with a slight\r\nwetting.\r\n\r\nBefore the party dispersed from the wharf Hope sought Philip, and had a\r\nfew moments\' conversation with him, the object of which was to agree\r\nupon further discourse on the morrow.  Hope and Margaret then\r\naccompanied Maria to her lodging, and walked thence silently home.\r\n\r\nHester was on the watch for them--a little anxious lest they should have\r\nsuffered from the storm, and ready with some reflections on the\r\nliabilities of parties of pleasure; but yet blithe and beaming.  Her\r\ncountenance fell when she saw her sister\'s pale face.\r\n\r\n"Margaret! how you look!" cried she.  "Cold, wet, and weary: and ill,\r\ntoo, I am sure."\r\n\r\n"Cold, wet, and weary," Margaret admitted.  "Let me make haste to bed.\r\nAnd do you make tea for Edward, and send some up to me.  Good-night!  I\r\ncannot talk now.  Edward will tell you."\r\n\r\n"Tell me what?"  Hester asked her husband, when she found that Margaret\r\nhad really rather have no attendance.\r\n\r\n"That Margaret is unhappy, love, from some misunderstanding with\r\nEnderby.  Some busy devil--I have no doubt the same that has caused so\r\nmuch mischief already--has come between him and Margaret."\r\n\r\nHe then told the story of Philip\'s sudden appearance, and his conduct\r\nthroughout the day, omitting all hint that any conversation with himself\r\nhad taken place.  He hoped, in conclusion, that all would be cleared up,\r\nand the mutual faith of the lovers restored.\r\n\r\nHester thought this impossible.  If Philip could be prejudiced against\r\nMargaret by any man or woman on earth, or any devil in hell, there must\r\nbe an instability in his character to which Margaret\'s happiness must\r\nnot be committed.  Hope was not sure of this.  There were circumstances\r\nof temptation, modes of delusion, under which the faith of a seraph\r\nmight sink.  But worse still, Hester said, was his conduct of to-day,\r\ntorturing Margaret\'s affection, wounding her pride, insulting her\r\ncruelly, in the presence of all those among whom she lived.  Hope was\r\ndisposed to suspend his judgment even upon this.  Enderby was evidently\r\nhalf-frantic.  His love was undiminished, it was clear.  It was the soul\r\nof all the madness of to-day.  Margaret had conducted herself nobly.\r\nHer innocence, her faith, must triumph at last.  They might bring her\r\nlover to her side again, Hester had little doubt: but she did not see\r\nwhat could now render Philip worthy of Margaret.  This had always been\r\nher apprehension.  How, after the passions of this day, could they ever\r\nagain be as they had been?  And tears, as gentle and sorrowful as\r\nMargaret had ever shed for her, now rained from Hester\'s eyes.\r\n\r\n"Be comforted, my Hester--my generous wife, be comforted.  You live for\r\nus--you are our best blessing, my love, and we can never bear to see you\r\nsuffer for her.  Be comforted, and wait.  Trust that the retribution of\r\nthis will fall where it ought; and that will never be upon our Margaret.\r\nPray that the retribution may fall where it ought, and that its\r\nbitterness may be intense as the joy which Margaret and you deserve."\r\n\r\n"I never knew you so revengeful, Edward," said his wife, taking the hand\r\nhe held before his eyes.  "Shall I admonish you for once?  Shall I give\r\nyou a reproof for wishing woe to our enemies?  Shall I remind you to\r\nforgive--fully, freely, as you hope to be forgiven?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, love; anything for the hope of being forgiven."\r\n\r\n"Ah! how deep your sorrow for Margaret is!  Grief always humbles us in\r\nour own eyes.  Such humiliation is the test of sorrow.  Bless you, love,\r\nthat you grieve so for Margaret!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY SIX.\r\n\r\nTHE NEXT DAY.\r\n\r\nThe hours of a sleepless night were not too long for Hope to revolve\r\nwhat he must say and do on the morrow.  He must meet Enderby; and the\r\nday would probably decide Margaret\'s fate.  That this decision would\r\nimplicate his own happiness or misery was a subordinate thought.  It was\r\nnot till after he had viewed Margaret\'s case in every light, in which\r\napprehension could place it, that he dwelt upon what the suffering to\r\nhimself must be of seeing Margaret, day by day, living on, in meek\r\npatience, amidst the destruction of hope and happiness which his\r\nattachment had caused.  When he did dwell upon it, his heart sank within\r\nhim.  All that had made him unhappy seemed of late to have passed away.\r\nFor many months he had seen Margaret satisfied in her attachment to\r\nanother; he had seen Hester coming out nobly from the trial of\r\nadversity, in which all her fine qualities had been exercised, and her\r\nweaknesses almost subdued.  She had been not only the devoted wife, but\r\npatient and generous towards her foes, full of faith and cheerfulness in\r\nher temper, and capable of any degree of self-denial in the conduct of\r\nher daily life.  She had been of late all that in the days of their\r\nengagement--in the days when he had dealt falsely with his own mind--he\r\nhad trusted she would be.  A friendship, whose tenderness was life\r\nenough for them both, had grown up in his soul, and he had been at\r\npeace.  It had been a subject of incessant thankfulness to him, that the\r\nevil of what he could now hardly consider as a false step had been\r\nconfined to himself--that his struggles, his strivings, the dreadful\r\nsolitary conflicts of a few months, had not been in vain; that he had\r\nfulfilled the claims of both relations, and marred no one\'s peace.  Now,\r\nhe was plunged into the struggle again.  The cause was at an end; but\r\nconsequences, of perhaps endless wretchedness, remained to be borne.\r\nHis secret was known, and made the basis of untruths to which the whole\r\nhappiness of his household, so victoriously struggled for, so carefully\r\ncherished by him, and so lately secured, must be sacrificed.  Again and\r\nagain he turned from the fearful visions of Margaret cast off, of the\r\nestrangement of the sisters, of the possible loss of some of their fair\r\nfame--from these harrowing thoughts he turned again and again to\r\nconsider what must be done.--The most certain thing was, that he must\r\nnot by word, look, pause, or admission, countenance to Enderby himself\r\nthe supposition that he had not preferred Hester at the time she became\r\nhis wife.  In the present state of their attachment, this was the merest\r\njustice to her.  Nothing that it was in Mrs Grey\'s power to reveal bore\r\na relation to any time later than his early, and, it might be assumed,\r\nsuperficial, intercourse with the sisters and, as far as he knew, no one\r\nelse, unless it were Frank (by this time in possession of the facts),\r\nhad ever conceived of the true state of the case.  He must decline all\r\nquestion about his domestic relations, except as far as Margaret was\r\nconcerned.  Beyond this, he would allow of no inquisition, and would\r\nforbid all speculation.  For Margaret\'s sake, no less than Hester\'s,\r\nthis was necessary.  If she should ever be Enderby\'s wife, it was of the\r\nutmost importance that Enderby should not, in his most secret soul, hold\r\nthis information, however strongly he might be convinced that Margaret\r\nwas in ignorance of it, and had never loved any but himself.  There must\r\nbe no admission to Enderby of that which had been truth, but which would\r\nbecome untruth by being first admitted now.  There must be entire\r\nsilence upon the whole subject of himself.--As to Margaret, he did not\r\nsee what could be done, but to declare his true and perfect belief that\r\nshe had never loved any but Enderby.  But alas! what chance was there of\r\nthis testimony being received; the very point of Enderby\'s accusation\r\nbeing, that they both looked, perhaps in self-delusion, at the\r\nconnection with him as their security from the consequences of Hope\'s\r\nweakness in marrying Hester?  It was all confused--all wretched--all\r\nnearly hopeless.  Margaret would be sacrificed without knowing why--\r\nwould have her heart wrung with the sense of injury in addition to her\r\nwoe.\r\n\r\nFrom reflections and anticipations, Hope rose early to the great duty of\r\nthe day.  He told Hester that he was going to meet Enderby in the\r\nmeadows, to receive a full explanation of his conduct of the preceding\r\nday; and that it was probable that he should bring home whatever tidings\r\nit might be Margaret\'s lot to hear.\r\n\r\nHe found, during the long and anxious conversation in the meadow, that\r\nhe had need of all the courage, calmness, and discretion he could\r\ncommand.  It was a cruel trial to one whose wont it had been from his\r\nchildhood to converse in "simplicity and godly sincerity,"--it was a\r\ncruel trial to hear evidence, upon evidence brought of what he knew to\r\nhave been fact, and to find connected with this, revolting falsehoods,\r\nagainst which he could only utter the indignation of his soul.  When he\r\nafterwards reflected how artfully the facts and falsehoods were\r\nconnected, he could no longer wonder at Enderby\'s convictions, nor at\r\nthe conduct which proceeded from them.  There was in Enderby this\r\nmorning no undue anger, no contempt which could excite anger in\r\nanother;--no doubt cast by him upon Hope\'s honour, or Margaret\'s purity\r\nof mind, as the world esteems purity.  However this might have been\r\nbefore their meeting of yesterday, it was now clear that, though\r\nimmoveably convinced of their mutual attachment, he supposed it to have\r\nbeen entertained as innocently as it was formed;--that Hope had been\r\nwrought upon by Mrs Grey, and by a consciousness of Hester\'s love; that\r\nhe had married from a false sense of honour, and then discovered his\r\nmistake;--that he had striven naturally, and with success, to persuade\r\nhimself that Margaret loved his friend, while Margaret had made the same\r\neffort, and would have married that friend for security and with the\r\nhope of rest in a home of her own, with one whom she might possibly love\r\nand to whom she was bound by his love of herself.\r\n\r\nAs for the evidence on which his belief was founded, there seemed to be\r\nno end to it.  Hope could do little but listen to the detail.  If he had\r\nbeen sitting in judgment on the conduct of an imputed criminal, he would\r\nhave wrestled with the evidence obstinately and long; but what could he\r\ndo, when it was the lover of his sister-in-law who was declaring why his\r\nconfidence in her was gone, and he must resume his plighted faith?  None\r\nbut those who had done the mischief could repair it; and least of all,\r\nHope himself.  He could only make one single, solemn protestation of his\r\nbelief that Margaret had loved none but Enderby, and deny the truth of\r\nevery statement that was inconsistent with this.\r\n\r\nThe exhibition of the evidence showed how penetrating, how sagacious, as\r\nwell as how industrious, malice can be.  There seemed to be no\r\ncircumstance connected with the sisters and their relation to Mr Hope,\r\nthat Mrs Rowland had not laid hold of.  Mrs Grey\'s visit to Hope\r\nduring his convalescence; his subsequent seclusion, and his depression\r\nwhen he reappeared--all these were noted; and it was these which sent\r\nEnderby to Mrs Grey for an explanation, which she had not had courage\r\nor judgment to withhold--which, indeed, she had been hurried into\r\ngiving.  She had admitted all that had passed between herself and Mr\r\nHope--his consternation at finding that it was Hester who loved him, and\r\nwhom he must marry, and the force with which Mrs Grey had felt herself\r\nobliged to urge that duty upon him.  Enderby connected with this his own\r\nobservations and feelings at the time; his last summer\'s conviction that\r\nit was Margaret whom Hope loved; his rapturous surprise on hearing of\r\nthe engagement being to Hester; and his wonder at the coldness with\r\nwhich his friend received his congratulations.  He now thought that he\r\nmust have been doomed to blindness not to have discerned the truth\r\nthrough all this.--Then there was his own intrusion during the interview\r\nwhich Hope had with Margaret;--their countenances had haunted him ever\r\nsince.  Hope\'s was full of constraint and anxiety;--he was telling his\r\nintentions:--Margaret\'s face was downcast, and her attitude motionless;\r\nshe was hearing her doom.--Then, after Hope was married, all Deerbrook\r\nwas aware of his failure of spirits; and of Margaret\'s no less.  It was\r\na matter of common remark, that there must be something amiss--that all\r\nwas not right at home.  They had, then, doubtless discovered that the\r\nattachment was mutual; and they might well be wretched.--Those who ought\r\nto know best had been convinced of this at an earlier stage of the\r\nintercourse.  Mrs Rowland had met at Cheltenham a young officer, an\r\nintimate friend of Mr Hope\'s family, who would not be persuaded that it\r\nwas not to the younger sister that Mr Hope was married.  He declared\r\nthat he knew, from the highest authority, that Hope was attached to\r\nMargaret, and that the attachment was returned.  It was not till Mrs\r\nRowland had shown him the announcement of the marriage in an old\r\nBlickley newspaper, which she happened to have used in packing her\r\ntrunk, that he would believe that it was the elder sister who was Hope\'s\r\nwife.--There was one person, however, who had known the whole, Enderby\r\nsaid; perhaps she was the only person who had been aware of it all: and\r\nthat was his mother.\r\n\r\nIn answer to Hope\'s exclamations upon the absurdity of this, Enderby\r\nsaid, that a thousand circumstances rose up to confirm Mrs Rowland\'s\r\nstatement that her mother had known all, and had learned it from\r\nMargaret herself.  Margaret had confided in her old friend as in a\r\nmother; and nothing could be more natural--nothing probably more\r\nnecessary to an overburdened heart.  This explained his mother\'s never\r\nhaving shown his letters to Margaret--the person for whom, as she knew,\r\nthey were chiefly written.  This explained the words of concern about\r\nthe domestic troubles of the Hopes, which, now and then during her long\r\nconfinement, she had dropped in Phoebe\'s hearing, and even in her\r\nletters to her son.  She had repeatedly regretted that Margaret would\r\nnot leave her sister\'s house, and return to Birmingham--saying that\r\nincome and convenience were not to be thought of for a moment, in\r\ncomparison with some other considerations.  In fact she had--it was\r\nweakness, perhaps, but one not to be too hardly judged under the\r\ncircumstances--she had revealed the whole to her daughter under\r\ninjunctions to secrecy, which had been strictly observed while she\r\nlived, and broken now only for a brother\'s sake, and after a long\r\nconflict between obligations apparently contradictory.  When, from her\r\ndeathbed, she had welcomed Margaret as a daughter-in-law, it was in the\r\ngratitude which it was natural for a mother to feel, on finding the\r\nattachment of an only son at length appreciated and rewarded.  When she\r\nhad implored Mrs Rowland to receive Margaret as a sister, and had seen\r\nthem embrace, her generous spirit had rejoiced in her young friend\'s\r\nconquest of an unhappy passion; and she had meant to convey to Priscilla\r\nan admonition to bury in oblivion what had become known to her, and to\r\nforgive Margaret for having loved any one but Philip.  Priscilla could\r\nnot make a difficulty at such a time, and in such a presence; she had\r\nsubmitted to the embrace, but her soul had recoiled from it; she had\r\nactually fainted under the shock: and ever since, she had declared to\r\nher brother, with a pertinacity which he had been unable to understand--\r\nwhich, indeed, had looked like sheer audacity, that he would never marry\r\nMargaret Ibbotson.  Philip was now convinced that he had done his sister\r\nmuch wrong.  Her temper and conduct were in some instances indefensible;\r\nbut since he had learned all this, and become aware how much of what he\r\nhad censured had been said and done out of affection for himself, he had\r\nbeen disposed rather to blame her for the lateness of her explanations,\r\nthan for any excess of zeal on his account,--zeal which he admitted had\r\ncarried her a point or two beyond the truth in some of her aims.  These\r\nstatements about the condition of Margaret\'s mind were borne out by\r\ncircumstances known to others.  When Margaret had been rescued from\r\ndrowning, Hope was heard to breathe, as he bent over her, "Oh God! my\r\nMargaret!" and it was observed that she rallied instantly on hearing the\r\nexclamation, and repaid him with a look worthy of his words.  This had\r\nbeen admitted to Enderby himself by the one who heard it, and who might\r\nbe trusted to speak of it to no one else.  Then, it was known that when\r\nMargaret was in the habit of taking long walks alone, towards the end of\r\nthe winter, she was met occasionally by her brother-in-law in his\r\nrides--naturally enough.  Their conversation had been overheard, once at\r\nleast, when they consulted about the peace of their home--how much of a\r\ncertain set of circumstances they should communicate to Mrs Hope, and\r\nwhether or not Mr Enderby was engaged to a lady abroad.  Without these\r\ntestimonies, Enderby felt that he had only to recur to his own\r\nexperience to be convinced that Margaret had never loved him, though\r\nstriving to persuade herself, as well as him, that she did.  The\r\ncalmness with which she had received his avowals that first evening last\r\nwinter, struck him with admiration at the time: he now understood it\r\nbetter.  He wondered he had felt so little till now the coldness of the\r\ntone of her correspondence.  The first thing which awakened him to an\r\nadmission of it, was her refusal to marry him in the spring.  She\r\nshrank, as she avowed, from leaving her present residence--she might\r\nhave said, from quitting those she loved best.\r\n\r\nIt was clear that in marrying she was to make a sacrifice to duty--to\r\nsecure innocence and safety for herself and those who were dearest to\r\nher; and that, when the time drew near, she recoiled from the effort.\r\nEnderby was thankful that all had become clear in time for her release\r\nand his own.\r\n\r\nThe horror with which Hope listened to this was beyond what he had\r\nprepared himself for--beyond all that he had yet endured.  Enderby\r\nseemed quite willing to hear him; but what could be said?  Only that\r\nwhich he had planned.  His protest against the truth of certain of the\r\nstatements, and the justice of some of the constructions of facts, was\r\nstrong.  He declared that, in his perfect satisfaction with his domestic\r\nstate, his happiness with his beloved and honoured wife, he would admit\r\nof no question about his family affairs, as far as he and Hester were\r\nconcerned.  He denied at once and for ever, all that went to show that\r\nMargaret had for a moment regarded him otherwise than as a friend and a\r\nbrother; and declared that the bare mention to her of the idea which was\r\nuppermost in Enderby\'s mind would be a cruelty and insult which could\r\nnever be retrieved.  He was not going to plead for her.  Bitterly as she\r\nmust suffer, it was from a cause which lay too deep for cure--from a\r\nwant of faith in her in one who ought to know her best, but from whom\r\nshe would be henceforth best separated, if what he had been saying was\r\nhis deliberate belief and judgment.--Enderby declaring that it was so,\r\nand that it was his intention to release Margaret from her engagement,\r\ngently and carefully, without useless explanation and without reproach,\r\nthere was nothing more to be said or done.  Hope prophesied, in parting,\r\nthat, of all the days of Enderby\'s life, this was perhaps that of which\r\nhe would one day most heartily repent; and while he spoke, he felt that\r\nthis same day was the one which he might himself find the most difficult\r\nto endure.  He left Enderby still pacing the meadow, and walked\r\nhomewards with a heart weighed down with grief--a grief which yet he\r\nwould fain have increased to any degree of intensity by taking\r\nMargaret\'s upon himself.\r\n\r\nMargaret was at the breakfast-table with her sister when he entered.\r\nHer eyes were swollen, but her manner was gentle and composed.  She\r\nlooked up at Edward, when he appeared, with an expression of timid\r\nexpectation in her face, which went to his soul.  A few words passed--a\r\nvery few, and then no more was said.\r\n\r\n"Yes; I have seen him.  He is very wretched.  He will not come, but we\r\nshall hear something, I have no doubt.  A strange persuasion which I\r\ncannot remove, of a prior attachment--of a want of frankness and\r\nconfidence.  He will explain himself presently.  But his persuasion is\r\nirremoveable."\r\n\r\nHester had much to say of him out of her throbbing heart; but she looked\r\nat Margaret, and restrained herself.  What must there be in _that_\r\nheart?  To utter one word would be irreverent.  The breakfast passed in\r\nan almost unbroken silence.\r\n\r\nIt had not been long over when the expected letter came.  Hope never saw\r\nit; but there was no need: he perfectly anticipated its contents, while\r\nto her for whom they were written they were incomprehensible.\r\n\r\n  "I spare you and myself the misery of an interview.  It must be\r\n  agonising to you, and there would be dishonour as well as pain to me,\r\n  in witnessing that agony.  If, as I fully believe, you have been\r\n  hitherto blind to the injustice of your connecting yourself with me,\r\n  from a sense of duty and expediency, when you had not a first genuine\r\n  love to give, I think you will see it now; and I pity your suffering\r\n  in the discovery.  There is only one point on which I wish or intend\r\n  to hang any reproach.  Why did you not, when I had become entitled to\r\n  your confidence, lay your heart fully open to me?  Did I not do so by\r\n  you?  Did I not reveal to you even the transient fancy which I\r\n  entertained long ago, and which I showed my faith in you, her friend,\r\n  by revealing?  If you had only done the same--if you had only let me\r\n  know, without a hint as to the object, that you had been attached, and\r\n  that you believed I might succeed to your affections in time--if you\r\n  had done this, I do not say that we should then have been what I so\r\n  lately trusted we were to be, for my soul is jealous--has been made so\r\n  by what I thought you--and will bear none but a first, and an entire,\r\n  and an exclusive love: but in that case I should have cherished you in\r\n  my inmost heart, as all that I have believed you to be, though not\r\n  destined for me.\r\n\r\n  "But I do not blame you.  You have done what you meant to be right;\r\n  though, from too great regard to one set of considerations, you have\r\n  mistaken the right, and have sacrificed me.  I make allowance for your\r\n  difficulty, and, for my own part, pardon you, and testify most\r\n  sincerely and earnestly to the purity of your mind and intentions.  Do\r\n  not reject this parting testimony.  I offer it because I would not\r\n  have you think me harsh, or suppose that passion has made me unjust.\r\n  I love you too deeply to do more than mourn.  I have no heart to\r\n  blame, except for your want of confidence.  Of that I have a right to\r\n  complain: but, for the rest, spare yourself the effort of\r\n  self-justification.  It is not needed.  I do not accuse you.  You were\r\n  right in saying yesterday that I love you still.  I shall ever love\r\n  you, be our separate lives what they may.  God bless you!\r\n\r\n  "PE."\r\n\r\n"Will you not wait, my dearest Margaret?" said Hester, when, within half\r\nan hour of the arrival of Enderby\'s letter, she met her sister on the\r\nstairs, with the reply in her hand, sealed, and ready to be sent.  "Why\r\nsuch haste?  The events of your life may hang on this day, on this one\r\nletter.  Can it be right to be so rapid in what you think and do?"\r\n\r\n"The event of my life is decided," she replied, "unless--No--the event\r\nof my life _is_ decided.  I have nothing more to wait for.  I have\r\nwritten what I think, and it must go."\r\n\r\nIt was as follows:--\r\n\r\n  "I have nothing to say in reply to your letter, for I cannot\r\n  understand it.  Yet I wonder less at your letter than at your having\r\n  written it instead of coming to me, to say all that is in your mind.\r\n  At some moments I still think that you will--I feel that you are on\r\n  your way hither, and I fancy that this dreadful dream of your\r\n  displeasure will pass away.  It is the first time in my life that any\r\n  one has been seriously and lastingly displeased with me; and, though I\r\n  feel that I have not deserved it, I am very wretched that you, of all\r\n  others, should blame me, and cease to trust me.  There ought to be\r\n  some comfort in the thought that your anger is without cause: but I\r\n  cannot find such comfort; for I feel that though I could endure your\r\n  loss by long absence or death, I cannot live in the spirit in which I\r\n  should wish to live, without your esteem.\r\n\r\n  "It is useless, alas! to entreat of you to come and explain yourself,\r\n  or in some other way to put me in possession of the cause of your\r\n  anger.  If you could resist the claims I had upon you for confidence\r\n  before I knew what was going to befall me--if you could resist the\r\n  demand I made yesterday, I fear there is little use in imploring you\r\n  to do me justice.  If I thought there was any chance, I would submit\r\n  to entreat, though I would not have you, any more than myself, forget\r\n  that I have a right to demand.  But indeed I would yield everything\r\n  that I dare forego, to have you awakened from this strange delusion\r\n  which makes us both wretched.  It is no time for pride now.  I care\r\n  not how fully you know what I feel.  I only wish that you could see\r\n  into my soul as into your own; for then you would not misjudge me as\r\n  you do.  I care not what any one may think of my throwing myself upon\r\n  the love which I am certain you feel for me, if I can only persuade\r\n  you to tell me what you mean, and to hear what I shall then have to\r\n  say.  What can I now say?  I will not reproach you, for I know you\r\n  must be even, if possible, more miserable than I: but yet, how can I\r\n  help feeling that you have been unjust and harsh with me?  Yes; though\r\n  the tone of your letter seems to be gentle, and you clearly mean it to\r\n  be so, I feel that you have been very harsh to me.  Nothing that you\r\n  can do shall ever make me so cruel to you.  You may rest satisfied\r\n  that, if we should not meet again, I will never be unjust to you.  To\r\n  every one about me it will appear that you are fickle and\r\n  dishonourable--that you have acted towards me as it is in the nature\r\n  of some men to act towards the women whose affections they possess; in\r\n  the nature of some men, but not in yours.  I know you to be incapable\r\n  of anything worse than error and mistrust (and, till yesterday, I\r\n  could not have believed you capable of this much wrong): and you may\r\n  trust me to impute to you nothing worse than this.  Suffering as I now\r\n  am, as we both are, under this error and mistrust, may I not implore\r\n  you, for your own sake (for mine it is too late), to nourish the weak\r\n  part of yourself, to question your own unworthy doubts, and to study\r\n  the best parts of the minds you meet, till you grow assured (as a\r\n  religious man ought to be) that there can be no self-interest, and\r\n  much less falsehood, mixed up with any real affection--with any such\r\n  affection as has existed between us two?\r\n\r\n  "I must not write more; for I do not know, I cannot conjecture, how\r\n  you may receive what I have written, thinking of me as you now do.  It\r\n  seems strange to remember that at this time yesterday, in this very\r\n  chair, I was writing to you.  Oh how differently!  Is it possible that\r\n  it was only yesterday--such a world of misery as we have lived through\r\n  since?  But I can write no more.  It may be that you will despise me\r\n  in every line as you read: after what has happened, I cannot tell.\r\n  Notwithstanding all I have said about trusting, I feel at this moment\r\n  as if I could never depend on anything in this world again.  If you\r\n  should come within this hour and explain all, how could I be sure that\r\n  the same thing might not happen again?  But do not let this weigh a\r\n  moment with you, if indeed you think of coming.  If I do not see you\r\n  to-day, I shall never see you.  I will then bear in mind, as you\r\n  desire, and as I cannot help, that you love me still; but how little\r\n  comfort is there in such love, when trust is gone!  God comfort us\r\n  both!\r\n\r\n  "Margaret Ibbotson."\r\n\r\nMrs Rowland was crossing the hall at the moment that her maid Betsy\r\nopened the door to Mr Hope\'s errand-boy, and took in this letter.\r\n\r\n"Where are you carrying that letter?" said she, as Betsy passed her.\r\n\r\n"To the study, ma\'am, against Mr Enderby comes in.  It is for Mr\r\nEnderby, ma\'am."\r\n\r\n"Very well."\r\n\r\nThe letter was placed on the study mantelpiece; the place of deposit for\r\nletters for absent members of the family.  Mrs Rowland meantime resumed\r\nher seat in the drawing-room, where the nursemaid was amusing the baby.\r\nMamma took the baby, and sent the maid away.  She had a strong belief\r\nthat her brother might be found somewhere in the shrubbery, though some\r\nfeeling had prevented her telling the servant so when the letter was\r\ntaken in.  She went, with the baby in her arms, into the study, to see\r\nwhether Philip was visible in any part of the garden that could be seen\r\nthence.  But she stopped short of the window.  The handwriting on the\r\naddress of the letter troubled her sight.  More than half-persuaded, as\r\nshe was, of the truth of much that she had told her brother, strenuously\r\nas she had nourished the few facts she was in possession of, till she\r\nhad made them yield a double crop of inferences, she was yet conscious\r\nof large exaggerations of what she knew, and of huge additions to what\r\nshe believed to be probabilities, and had delivered as facts.  There was\r\nin that handwriting a prophecy of detection: and, like other cowards,\r\nshe began to tamper with her reason and conscience.\r\n\r\n"There is great mischief in letters at such times," she thought.  "They\r\nare so difficult to answer! and it is so possible to produce any effect\r\nthat may be wished by them!  As my husband was reading the other\r\nday--`It is so easy to be virtuous, to be perfect, upon paper!\'  Nothing\r\nthat the girl can say ought to alter the state of the case: it can only\r\nharass Philip\'s feelings, and perhaps cause all the work to be gone over\r\nagain.  His letter was meant to be final, I am confident, from his\r\nintending to go away this evening.  There should have been no answer.\r\nThis letter is a pure impertinence, and ought to be treated as such.  It\r\nis a sort of duty to use it as it deserves.  Many parents (at least I\r\nknow old Mr Boyle did) burn letters which they know to contain offers\r\nto daughters whom they do not wish to part with.  Mr Boyle had no\r\nscruple; and I am sure this is a stronger case.  Better end the whole\r\naffair at once; and then Philip will be free to form a better\r\nconnection.  He will thank me one day for having broken off this."\r\n\r\nShe carried the letter into the drawing-room, slowly contemplating it as\r\nshe went.  She thought, for one fleeting instant, of reading it.  She\r\nwas not withheld by honour, but by fear.  She shrank from encountering\r\nits contents.  She glanced over the mantelpiece, and saw that the\r\nlucifer-matches were at hand.  To make the letter burn quickly, it was\r\nnecessary to unfold it.  She put the child down upon the rug--a\r\nfavourite play-place, for the sake of the gay pink and green shavings\r\nwhich, at this time of the year, curtained the grate.  While baby\r\ncrawled, and gazed quietly and contentedly there, Mrs Rowland broke the\r\nseal of Margaret\'s letter, turning her eyes from the writing, laid the\r\nblistered sheet in the hearth, and set fire to it.  The child set up a\r\nloud crow of delight at the flame.  At that moment, even this simple and\r\nfamiliar sound startled its mother out of all power of self-control.\r\nShe snatched up the child with a vehemence which frightened it into a\r\nshrill cry.  She feared the nursemaid would come before all the sparks\r\nwere out; and she tried to quiet the baby by dancing it before the\r\nmirror over the mantelpiece.  She met her own face there, white as\r\nashes; and the child saw nothing that could amuse it, while its eyes\r\nwere blinded with tears.  She opened the window to let it hearken to the\r\nchurch clock; and the device was effectual.  Baby composed its face to\r\nserious listening, before the long succession of strokes was finished,\r\nand allowed the tears to be wiped from its cheeks.\r\n\r\nOne thing more remained to be done.  Mrs Rowland heard a step in the\r\nhall, and looked out: it was Betsy\'s.\r\n\r\n"I thought it was you.  Pray desire cook to send up a cup of broth for\r\nMiss Rowland\'s lunch; and be sure and let Miss Rowland know, the moment\r\nit is ready.  Mr Enderby is in the shrubbery, I think."\r\n\r\n"Yes, ma\'am; seeing he was there, I was coming to ask about the letter,\r\nma\'am, to carry it to him."\r\n\r\n"Oh, that letter--I sent it to him.  He has got it.  Tell cook directly\r\nabout the broth."\r\n\r\nAt lunch-time, one of the children was desired to summon Uncle Philip.\r\nMrs Rowland took care to meet him at the garden door.  She saw him cast\r\na wistful eye towards the study mantelpiece, as he passed the open door.\r\nHis sister observed that she believed it was past post time for this\r\nhalf-week.  He sighed deeply; and she felt that no sigh of his had ever\r\nso gone to her heart before.\r\n\r\n"Why, mamma! do look!" cried George, as well as a mouthful of bread\r\nwould allow.  "Look at the chimney!  Where are all the shavings gone?\r\nThere is the knot at the top that they were tied together with, but not\r\na bit of shaving left.  Have they blown up the chimney?"\r\n\r\n"What will poor baby say?" exclaimed Matilda.  "All the pretty pink and\r\ngreen gone!"\r\n\r\n"There is some tinder blowing about," observed George.  "I do believe\r\nthey have been burnt."\r\n\r\n"Shut the window, George, will you?  There is no bearing this draught.\r\nThere is no bearing Betsy\'s waste either.  She has burned those shavings\r\nsomehow in cleaning the grate.  Her carelessness is past endurance."\r\n\r\n"Make her buy some new shavings, mamma, for baby\'s sake."\r\n\r\n"Do be quiet, and get your lunch.  Hand your uncle the dish of\r\ncurrants."\r\n\r\nPhilip languidly picked a few bunches.  He had noticed nothing that had\r\npassed, as his sister was glad to observe.  Besides being too much\r\naccustomed, to hear complaints of the servants to give any heed to them,\r\nhe was now engrossed with his own wretched thoughts.  Every five minutes\r\nthat passed without bringing a reply from Margaret, went to confirm his\r\nmost painful impressions.\r\n\r\nMargaret meantime was sitting alone in her chamber, enduring the long\r\nmorning as she best might.  Now plying her needle as if life depended on\r\nher industry, and now throwing up her employment in disgust, she\r\nlistened for the one sound she needed to hear, till her soul was sick of\r\nevery other.  "I must live wholly within myself now," she thought, "as\r\nfar as he is concerned.  I can never speak of him, or allow Hester and\r\nMaria to speak of him to me; for they will blame him.  Every one will\r\nblame him: Maria did yesterday.  No one will do him justice.  I cannot\r\nask Mrs Grey, as I intended, anything of what she may have seen and\r\nheard about all this.  I have had my joy to myself: I have carried about\r\nmy solitary glory and bliss in his being mine; and now I must live alone\r\nupon my grief for him; for no one person in the world will pity and\r\njustify him but myself.  He has done me no wrong that he could help.\r\nHis staying away to-day is to save me pain, as he thinks.  I wish I had\r\nnot said in my letter that he has been harsh to me.  Perhaps he would\r\nhave been here by this time if I had not said that.  How afraid he was,\r\nthat day in the spring when he urged me so to marry at once--(Oh! if I\r\nhad, all this would have been saved! and yet I thought, and I still\r\nthink, I was right.)  But how afraid he was of our parting, lest evil\r\nshould come between us!  I promised him it should not, for my own part:\r\nbut who could have thought that the mistrust would be on his side?  He\r\nhad a superstitious feeling, he said, that something would happen--that\r\nwe should be parted: and I would not hear of it.  How presumptuous I\r\nwas!  How did I dare to make so light of what has come so dreadfully\r\ntrue?--Oh! why are we so made that we cannot see into one another\'s\r\nhearts?  If we are made to depend on one another so absolutely as we\r\nare, so that we hold one another\'s peace to cherish or to crush, why is\r\nit such a blind dependence?  Why are we left so helpless?  Why, with so\r\nmany powers as are given us, have we not that one other, worth all the\r\nrest, of mutual insight?  If God would bestow this power for this one\r\nday, I would give up all else for it for ever after.  Philip would trust\r\nme again then, and I should understand him; and I could rest afterwards,\r\nhappen what might--though then nothing would happen but what was good.\r\nBut now, shut in, each into ourselves, with anger and sorrow all about\r\nus, from some mistake which a moment\'s insight might remove--it is the\r\ndreariest, the most tormenting state!  What are all the locks, and bars,\r\nand fetters in the world to it?  So near each other too!  When one look,\r\none tone, might perhaps lead to the clearing up of it all!  There is no\r\noccasion to bear this, however.  So near as we are, nothing should\r\nprevent our meeting--nothing shall prevent it."\r\n\r\nShe started up, and hastily put on her bonnet and gloves: but when her\r\nhand was on the lock of her door, her heart misgave her.  "If it should\r\nfail!" she thought.  "If he should neither look at me nor speak to me--\r\nif he should leave me as he did yesterday!  I should never get over the\r\nshame.  I dare not store up such a wretched remembrance, to make me\r\nmiserable as often as I think of it, for as long as I live.  If he will\r\nnot come after reading my letter, neither would he hear me if I went to\r\nhim.  Oh! he is very unjust!  After all his feats of my being influenced\r\nagainst him, he might have distrusted himself.  After making me promise\r\nto write, on the first doubt that any one might try to put into my mind,\r\nhe might have remembered to do the same by me, instead of coming down in\r\nthis way, not to explain, but to overwhelm me with his displeasure,\r\nwithout giving me a moment\'s time to justify myself.  Edward seems\r\nstrangely unkind too," she sighed, as she slowly untied her bonnet and\r\nput it away, as if to avoid tempting herself with the sight of it again.\r\n"I never knew Edward unjust or unkind before; but I heard him ask\r\nPhilip why he staid to hear me in the abbey yesterday; and though he has\r\nbeen with Philip this morning, he does not seem to have made the\r\nslightest attempt to bring us together.  When such as Edward and Philip\r\ndo so wrong, one does not know where to trust, or what to hope.  There\r\nis nothing to trust, but God and the right.  I will live for these, and\r\nno one shall henceforth hear me complain, or see me droop, or know\r\nanything of what lies deepest in my heart.  This must be possible; it\r\nhas been done.  Many nuns in their convents have carried it through: and\r\nmissionaries in heathen countries, and all the wisest who have been\r\nbefore their age; and some say--Maria would say--almost every person who\r\nhas loved as I have: but I do not believe this: I do not believe that\r\nmany--that any can have felt as I do now.  It is not natural and right\r\nthat any should live as I mean to do.  We are made for confidence, not\r\nfor such solitude and concealment.  But it may be done when\r\ncircumstances press as they do upon me; and, if God gives me strength, I\r\nwill do it.  I will live for Him and his; and my heart, let it suffer as\r\nit may, shall never complain to human ear.  It shall be as silent as the\r\ngrave."\r\n\r\nThe resolution held for some hours.  Margaret was quiet and composed\r\nthrough dinner, though her expectation, instead of dying out, grew more\r\nintense with every hour.  After dinner, Hope urged his wife to walk with\r\nhim.  It had been a fine day, and she had not been out.  There was still\r\nanother hour before dark.  Would not Margaret go too?  No; Margaret\r\ncould not leave home.\r\n\r\nWhen Hester came down, equipped for her walk, she sat beside her sister\r\non the sofa for a minute or two, while waiting for Edward.\r\n\r\n"Margaret," said she, "will you let me say one word to you?"\r\n\r\n"Anything, Hester, if you will not be hard upon any one whom you cannot\r\nfully understand."\r\n\r\n"I would not for the world be hard, love.  But there was once a time,\r\nabove a year ago, when you warned me, kindly warned me, though I did not\r\nreceive it kindly, against pride as a support.  You said it could not\r\nsupport me; and you said truly.  May I say the same to you now?"\r\n\r\n"Thank you.  It is kind of you.  I will consider; but I do not think\r\nthat I have any pride in me to-day.  I feel humbled enough."\r\n\r\n"It is not for you to feel humbled, love.  Reverence yourself; for you\r\nmay.  Nothing has happened to impair your self-respect.  Admit freely to\r\nyour own mind, and to us, that you have been cruelly injured, and that\r\nyou suffer as you must and ought.  Admit this freely, and then rely on\r\nyourself and us."\r\n\r\nMargaret shook her head.  She did not say it, but she felt that she\r\ncould not rely on Edward, while he seemed to stand between her and\r\nPhilip.  He came in at the moment, and she averted her eyes from him.\r\nHe felt her displeasure in his heart\'s core.\r\n\r\nWhen they returned, sooner than she had expected, from their walk, they\r\nhad bad news for her, which they had agreed it was most merciful not to\r\ndelay.  They had seen Enderby in Mr Rowland\'s gig on the Blickley road.\r\nHe had his carpet-bag with him; and Mr Rowland\'s man was undoubtedly\r\ndriving him to Blickley, to meet the night coach for London.\r\n\r\n"It is better to save you all further useless expectation," observed\r\nEdward.  "We keep nothing from you."\r\n\r\n"You keep nothing from me!" said Margaret, now fixing her eyes upon him.\r\n"Then what is your reason for not having brought us together, if indeed\r\nyou have not kept us apart?  Do you suppose I did not hear you send him\r\nfrom me yesterday?  And how do I know that you have not kept him away\r\nto-day?"\r\n\r\n"My dear Margaret!" exclaimed Hester: but a look from her husband, and\r\nthe recollection of Margaret\'s misery, silenced her.  For the first time\r\nHester forgave on the instant the act of blaming her husband.\r\n\r\n"Whatever I have done, whether it appears clear to you or not," replied\r\nHope, "it is from the most tender respect for your feelings.  I shall\r\nalways respect them most tenderly; and not the less for their being hurt\r\nwith me."\r\n\r\n"I have no doubt of your meaning all that is kind, Edward: but surely\r\nwhen two people misunderstand each other, it is best that they should\r\nmeet.  If you have acted from a regard to what you consider my dignity,\r\nI could wish that you had left the charge of it to myself."\r\n\r\n"You are right: quite right."\r\n\r\n"Then why--.  Oh!  Edward, if you repent what you have done, it may not\r\nyet be too late!"\r\n\r\n"I do not repent.  I have done you no wrong to-day, Margaret.  I grieve\r\nfor you, but I could not have helped you."\r\n\r\n"Let us never speak on this subject again," said Margaret, stung by the\r\nconsciousness of having so soon broken the resolution of the morning,\r\nthat her suffering heart should be as silent as the grave.  "It is not\r\nfrom pride, Hester, that I say so; but let us never again speak of all\r\nthis."\r\n\r\n"Let us know but one thing, Margaret," said Edward;--"that yours is the\r\ngenerous silence of forgiveness.  I do not mean with regard to him--for\r\nI fear you will forgive him sooner than we can do.  I do not mean him\r\nparticularly, nor those who have poisoned his ear; but all.  Only tell\r\nus that your silence is the oblivion of mercy, so mourning for the\r\nerring that, for its own sake, it remembers their transgressions no\r\nmore."\r\n\r\nMargaret looked up at them both.  Though her eyes swam in tears, there\r\nwas a smile upon her lips as she held out her hand to her brother, and\r\nyielded herself to Hester\'s kiss.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY SEVEN.\r\n\r\nTHE CONQUEROR.\r\n\r\nMrs Rowland did not find herself much the happier for being borne out\r\nby the whole world in her assertions, that Philip and Margaret were not\r\nengaged.  She knew that, with regard to this, she now stood justified in\r\nthe eyes of all Deerbrook, that almost everyone there now believed that\r\nit had been an entanglement from which she had released her brother.\r\nFrom selfish fear, from dread of the consequences of going so far as to\r\nbe again sent by her husband to Cheltenham, or by the Levitts to\r\nCoventry; from foresight of the results which would ensue from her\r\nprovoking an inquiry into the domestic concerns of the Hopes--an inquiry\r\nwhich might end in the reconciliation of Philip and Margaret, and in\r\nsome unpleasant discoveries about herself--she was very guarded\r\nrespecting the grand accusation by which she had wrought on her brother.\r\nNo hint of it got abroad in Deerbrook: nothing was added to the ancient\r\ngossip about the Hopes not being very happy together.  Mrs Rowland knew\r\nthat affairs stood in this satisfactory state.  She knew that Margaret\r\nwas exposed to as much observation and inquiry as a country village\r\naffords, respecting her disappointed attachment--that the Greys were\r\nvery angry, and praised Margaret to every person they met--that Mr\r\nWalcot eulogised Mrs Rowland\'s discernment to all Mrs Rowland\'s\r\nparty--that Mrs Howell and Miss Miskin lifted up their eyes in\r\nthankfulness at Mr Enderby\'s escape from such a connection--that Mr\r\nHope was reported to be rather flat in spirits--and that Margaret was\r\ncertainly looking thin: she knew of all this success, and yet she was\r\nnot happier than six months ago.  The drawback on such successes is,\r\nthat they are never complete.  There is always some Mordecai sitting at\r\nthe gate to mar the enjoyment.  Mrs Rowland was aware of Mrs James\r\nhaving dropped that she and her husband had nothing to do with anybody\'s\r\nfamily quarrels; that there was always a great deal to be said on both\r\nsides in such cases; and that they had never seen anything but what was\r\namiable and pleasant in Miss Ibbotson and her connections.  She knew\r\nthat Dr Levitt called on the Hopes full as often as at any house in\r\nDeerbrook; and that Mrs Levitt had offered to take some of Margaret\'s\r\nplants into her greenhouse, to be nursed through the winter.  She was\r\nalways hearing that Miss Young and Margaret were much together, and that\r\nthey were happy in each other\'s society; and she alternately fancied\r\nthem talking about her, exposing to each other the injuries she had\r\nwrought to both, and enjoying an oblivion of their cares in her despite.\r\nShe could never see Maria taking an airing in the Greys\' shrubbery,\r\nleaning on Margaret\'s arm, or Margaret turning in at the farrier\'s gate,\r\nwithout feeling her colour rise.  She knew that Mr Jones was apt to\r\naccommodate Miss Ibbotson with a choice of meat, in preference to his\r\nother customers; and that Mrs Jones had spoken indignantly to a\r\nneighbour about fine gentlemen from London that think little of breaking\r\none young heart after another, to please their own vanity, and never\r\ncome back to look upon the eyes that they have made dim, and the cheeks\r\nthat grow pale for them.\r\n\r\nAll these things Mrs Rowland knew; and they ate into her heart.  In\r\nthese days of her triumph she moved about in fear; and no hour passed\r\nwithout troubling her victory.  She felt that she could not rest till\r\nthe corner-house family was got rid of.  They did not seem disposed to\r\nmove of their own accord.  She incessantly expressed her scorn of the\r\nwant of spirit of a professional man who would live on in a place where\r\nhe had lost his practice, and where a rival was daily rising upon his\r\nruins: but the Hopes staid on still.  Week after week they were to be\r\nmet in the lanes and meadows--now gleaning in the wake of the\r\nharvest-wain, with Fanny and Mary, for the benefit of widow Rye; now\r\nblackberry gathering in the fields; now nutting in the hedgerows.  The\r\nquarterly term came round, and no notice that he might look out for\r\nanother tenant reached Mr Rowland.  If they would not go of their own\r\naccord, they must be dislodged; for she felt, though she did not fully\r\nadmit the truth to herself; that she could not much longer endure their\r\npresence.  She looked out for an opportunity of opening the subject\r\nadvantageously with Mr Rowland.\r\n\r\nThe wine and walnuts were on the table, and the gentleman and lady were\r\namusing themselves with letting Anna and Ned try to crack walnuts (the\r\nthree elder children being by this time at school at Blickley), when\r\nMrs Rowland began her attack.\r\n\r\n"My dear," said she, "is the corner-house in perfectly good repair at\r\npresent?"\r\n\r\n"I believe so.  It was thoroughly set to rights when Mr Hope went into\r\nit, and again after the riot; and I have heard no complaint since."\r\n\r\n"Ah! after the riot; that is what I wanted to know.  The surgery is well\r\nfitted up, is it?"\r\n\r\n"No doubt.  The magistrates took care that everything should be done\r\nhandsomely.  Mr Hope was fully satisfied."\r\n\r\n"He was: then there seems no doubt that Mr Walcot had better remove to\r\nthe corner-house when the Hopes go away.  It is made to be a surgeon\'s\r\nresidence: and I own I do not like to see those blinds of Mr Walcot\'s,\r\nwith that staring word `Surgery,\' upon them, in the windows of my poor\r\nmother\'s breakfast-room."\r\n\r\n"Nor I: but the Hopes are not going to remove."\r\n\r\n"I believe they will be leaving Deerbrook before long."\r\n\r\n"I believe not."\r\n\r\n"My dear Mr Rowland, I have reason for what I say."\r\n\r\n"So have I.  Take care of that little thumb of yours, my darling, or you\r\nwill be cracking it instead of the walnut."\r\n\r\n"What is your reason for thinking that the Hopes will not leave\r\nDeerbrook, Mr Rowland?"\r\n\r\n"Mr Hope told me so himself."\r\n\r\n"Ah! that is nothing.  You will be about the last person he will inform\r\nof his plans.  Mr Walcot\'s nearest friends will be the last to know, of\r\ncourse."\r\n\r\n"Pray, do not make me out one of Mr Walcot\'s nearest friends, my dear.\r\nI have a very slight acquaintance with the young gentleman, and do not\r\nintend to have more."\r\n\r\n"You say so now to annoy me, my love: but you may change your mind.  If\r\nyou should see Mr Walcot your son-in-law at some future day, you will\r\nnot go on to call him a slight acquaintance, I suppose?"\r\n\r\n"My son-in-law!  Have you been asking him to marry Matilda?"\r\n\r\n"I wait, Mr Rowland, till he asks it himself; which I foresee he will\r\ndo as soon as our dear girl is old enough to warrant his introducing the\r\nsubject.  Her accomplishments are not lost upon him.  He has the\r\nprophetic eye which sees what a wonderful creature she must become.  And\r\nif we are permitted to witness such an attachment as theirs will be, and\r\nour dear girl settled beside us here, we shall have nothing left to\r\nwish."\r\n\r\n"To speak of something more nearly at hand, I beg, my dear, that you\r\nwill hold out no expectation of the corner-house to Mr Walcot, as it is\r\nnot likely to be vacated."\r\n\r\n"Has the rent been regularly paid, so far?"\r\n\r\n"To be sure it has."\r\n\r\n"By Mr Grey\'s help, I have no doubt.  My dear, I know what I am saying.\r\nThe Hopes are as poor as the rats in your granary; and it is not to be\r\nsupposed that Mr Grey will long go on paying their rent for them, just\r\nfor the frolic of sustaining Mr Hope against Mr Walcot.  It is paying\r\ntoo dear for the fancy.  The Hopes are wretchedly pinched for money.\r\nThey have dropped their subscription to the book club."\r\n\r\n"I am very sorry to hear it.  I would give half I am worth that it were\r\notherwise."\r\n\r\n"Give it them at once, then, and it will be otherwise."\r\n\r\n"I would, gladly; but they will not take it."\r\n\r\n"I advise you to try, however; it would make such a pretty romantic\r\nstory!--Well, Mr Grey is extremely mortified at their withdrawing from\r\nthe book club.  He remonstrated very strongly indeed."\r\n\r\n"That does not agree very well with his paying their rent for them."\r\n\r\n"Perfectly well.  He thinks that if he undertakes the large thing, for\r\nthe sake of their credit, they might have managed the small.  This is\r\nhis way of viewing the matter, no doubt.  He sees how their credit will\r\nsuffer by their giving up the book club.  He sees how everybody will\r\nremark upon it."\r\n\r\n"So do they, I have no doubt."\r\n\r\n"And the matter will not be mended by Sophia Grey\'s nonsense.  What\r\nabsurd things that girl does!  I wonder her mother allows it,--only\r\nthat, to be sure, she is not much wiser herself.  Sophia has told some\r\nof her acquaintance, and all Deerbrook will hear it before long, that\r\nher cousins have withdrawn from the book club on account of Hester\'s\r\nsituation; that they are to be so busy with the baby that is coming,\r\nthat they will have no time to read."\r\n\r\n"As long as the Hopes are above false pretences, they need not care for\r\nsuch as are made for them.  There! show mamma what a nice plump walnut\r\nyou have cracked for her."\r\n\r\n"Nicely done, my pet.  But, Mr Rowland, the Hopes cannot hold out.\r\nThey cannot possibly stay here.  You will not get their rent at\r\nChristmas, depend upon it."\r\n\r\n"I shall not press them for it, I assure you."\r\n\r\n"Then you will be unjust to your family.  You owe it to your children,\r\nto say nothing of myself, to look after your property."\r\n\r\n"I owe it to them not to show myself a harsh landlord to excellent\r\ntenants.  But we need not trouble ourselves about what will happen at\r\nChristmas.  It may be that the rent will make its appearance on the\r\nmorning of quarter-day."\r\n\r\n"Then, if not, you will give them notice that the house is let from the\r\nnext quarter, will you not?"\r\n\r\n"By no means, my dear."\r\n\r\n"If you do not like to undertake the office yourself, perhaps you will\r\nlet me do it.  I have a good deal of courage about doing disagreeable\r\nthings, on occasion."\r\n\r\n"You have, my dear; but I do not wish that this should be done.  I mean,\r\nI desire that it be not done.  The Hopes shall live in that house of\r\nmine as long as they please.  And if," continued Mr Rowland, not liking\r\nthe expression of his lady\'s eye,--"if any one disturbs them in their\r\npresent abode--the consequence will be that I shall be compelled to\r\ninvite them here.  I shall establish them in this very house, sooner\r\nthan that they shall be obliged to leave Deerbrook against their will;\r\nand then, my dear, you will have to be off to Cheltenham again."\r\n\r\n"What nonsense you talk, Mr Rowland!  Who should disturb them, if you\r\nwon\'t be open to reason, so as to do it yourself?  I thought you knew\r\nenough of what it is to be ridden by poor tenants, to wish to avoid the\r\nplague, if warned in time.  But some people can never take warning."\r\n\r\n"Let us see that you can, my love.  You will remember what I have said\r\nabout the Hopes being disturbed, I have no doubt.  And now we have done\r\nwith that, I want to tell you--"\r\n\r\n"Presently, when we have really done with this subject, my dear.  I have\r\nother reasons--"\r\n\r\n"Which you will spare me the hearing.  My dear Priscilla, there are no\r\nreasons on earth which can justify me in turning this family out of\r\ntheir house, or you in asking me to do it.  Let us hear no more about\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"But you must hear.  I will be heard on a subject in which I have such\r\nan interest, Mr Rowland."\r\n\r\n"Ring the bell, my little fellow.  Pull hard.  That\'s it--Candles in the\r\noffice immediately."\r\n\r\nAnd Mr Rowland tossed off the last half of his glass of port, kissed\r\nthe little ones, and was gone.  The lady remained to compassionate\r\nherself; which she did very deeply, that she could find no means of\r\nridding herself of the great plague of her life.  These people were\r\nalways in her way, and no one would help her to dislodge them.  Her own\r\nhusband was against her--quite unmanageable and perverse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY EIGHT.\r\n\r\nTHE VICTIMS.\r\n\r\nIf Mrs Rowland was dissatisfied with her success, while seeing that\r\nsome resources of comfort remained to the Hopes and Margaret, a view of\r\nthe interior of the corner-house would probably have affected her\r\ndeeply, and set her moralising on the incompleteness of all human\r\ntriumphs.  There was peace there which even she could not invade--could\r\nonly, if she had known it, envy.  Her power was now exhausted, and her\r\nwork was unfinished.  For many weeks, she had made Margaret as miserable\r\nas she had intended to make her.  Margaret had suffered from an\r\nexasperating sense of injury; but that was only for a few hours.  Hers\r\nwas not a nature which could retain personal resentment for any length\r\nof time.  She needed the relief of compassionate and forgiving feelings;\r\nand she cast herself into them for solace, as the traveller, emerging\r\nfrom the glaring desert, throws himself down beside the gushing spring\r\nin the shade.  From the moment that she did this, it became her chief\r\ntrouble that Philip was blamed by others.  Her friends said as little as\r\nthey could in reference to him, out of regard for her feelings; but she\r\ncould not help seeing that Maria\'s indignation was strong, and that\r\nHester considered that her sister had had a happy escape from a man\r\ncapable of treating her as Philip had done.  If it had been possible to\r\nundertake his defence, Margaret would have done so.  As there were no\r\nmeans of working upon others to forgive her wrongs, she made it her\r\nconsolation to forgive them doubly herself; to cheer up under them; to\r\nlive for the aim of being more worthy of Philip\'s love, the less he\r\nbelieved her to be so.  Her lot was far easier now than it had been in\r\nthe winter.  She had been his; and she believed that she still occupied\r\nhis whole soul.  She was not now the solitary, self-despising being she\r\nhad felt herself before.  Though cut off from intercourse with him as if\r\nthe grave lay between them, she knew that sympathy with her heart and\r\nmind existed.  She experienced the struggles, the moaning efforts, of\r\naffections doomed to solitude and silence; the shrinking from a whole\r\nlong life of self-reliance, of exclusion from domestic life; the\r\noccasional horror of contemplating the waste and withering of some of\r\nthe noblest parts of the immortal nature,--a waste and withering which\r\nare the almost certain consequence of violence done to its instincts and\r\nits laws.  From these pains and terrors she suffered; and from some of\r\nsmaller account,--from the petty insults, or speculations of the more\r\ncoarse-minded of her neighbours, and the being too suddenly reminded by\r\npassing circumstances of the change which had come over her expectations\r\nand prospects; but her love, her forgiveness, her conviction of being\r\nbeloved, bore her through all these, and saved her from that fever of\r\nthe heart, in the paroxysms of which she had, in her former and severer\r\ntrial, longed for death, even for non-existence.\r\n\r\nShe could enjoy but little of what had been her favourite solace at that\r\ntime.  She had but few opportunities now for long solitary walks.  She\r\nsaw the autumn fading away, melting in rain and cold fog, without its\r\nhaving been made use of.  It had been as unfavourable a season as the\r\nsummer,--dreary, unproductive, disappointing in every way; but there had\r\nbeen days in the latter autumn when the sun had shown his dim face, when\r\nthe dank hedges had looked fresh, and the fallen leaves in the\r\nwood-paths had rustled under the tread of the squirrel; and Margaret\r\nwould on such days have liked to spend the whole morning in rambles by\r\nherself.  But there were reasons why she should not.  Almost before the\r\nchilliness of the coming season began to be felt, hardship was\r\ncomplained of throughout the country.  The prices of provisions were\r\ninordinately high; and the evil consequences which, in the rural\r\ndistricts, follow upon a scarcity, began to make themselves felt.  The\r\npoachers were daring beyond belief; and deep was the enmity between the\r\nlarge proprietors and the labourers around them.  The oldest men and\r\nwomen, and children scarcely able to walk, were found trespassing day by\r\nday in all plantations, with bags, aprons, or pinafores, full of\r\nfir-cones, and wood snapped off from the trees, or plucked out of the\r\nhedges.  There was no end to repairing the fences.  There were\r\nunpleasant rumours, too, of its being no longer safe to walk singly in\r\nthe more retired places.  No such thing as highway robbery had ever\r\nbefore been heard of at Deerbrook, within the memory of the oldest\r\ninhabitant; the oldest of the inhabitants being Jim Bird, the man of a\r\nhundred years.  But there was reason now for the caution.  Mr Jones\'s\r\nmeat-cart had been stopped on the high-road, by two men who came out of\r\nthe hedge, and helped themselves to what the cart contained.  An\r\nill-looking fellow had crossed the path of Mrs James and her young\r\nsister in the Verdon woods, evidently with the intention of stopping the\r\nladies; but luckily the jingling of a timber-wain was heard below, and\r\nthe man had retreated.  Mr Grey had desired that the ladies of his\r\nfamily would not go further without his escort than a mile out and back\r\nagain on the high-road.  They were not to attempt the lanes.  The Miss\r\nAndersons no longer came into Deerbrook in their pony-chaise; and Mrs\r\nHowell reported to all her customers that Lady Hunter never walked in\r\nher own grounds without a footman behind her, two dogs before her, and\r\nthe game-keeper within hearing of a scream.  Mr Walcot was advised to\r\nleave his watch and purse at home when he set forth to visit his country\r\npatients; and it did not comfort him much to perceive that his\r\nneighbours were always vigilant to note the hour and minute of his\r\nsetting forth, and to learn the precise time when he might be looked for\r\nat home again.  It was observed, that he was generally back half-an-hour\r\nsooner than he was expected, with a very red face, and his horse all in\r\na foam.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these grounds of objection to solitary walks, Margaret\r\nhad strong domestic reasons for denying herself the rambles she\r\ndelighted in.  As the months rolled on, poverty pressed closer and\r\ncloser.  When the rent was secured, and some of the comforts provided\r\nwhich Hester must have in her confinement, so little was left that it\r\nbecame necessary to limit the weekly expenses of the family to a sum\r\nsmall enough to require the nicest management, and the most strenuous\r\ndomestic industry, to make it suffice.  Hope would not pledge his credit\r\nwhile he saw so little prospect of redeeming it.  His family were of one\r\nmind as to purchasing nothing which they were not certainly able to pay\r\nfor.  This being his principle, he made every effort to increase his\r\nfunds.  A guinea or two dropped in now and then, in return for\r\ncontributions to medical periodicals.  Money was due to him from some of\r\nhis patients.  To these he sent in his bills again, and even made\r\npersonal application.  From several he obtained promises; from two or\r\nthree the amount of whose debt was very small, he got his money,\r\ndisgraced by smiles of wonder and contempt.  From the greater number he\r\nreceived nothing but excuses on account of the pressure of the times.\r\nThe small sums he did recover were of a value which none of the three\r\nhad ever imagined that money could be to them.  Every little extra\r\ncomfort thus obtained,--the dinner of meat once oftener in the week, the\r\nfire in the evening, the new gloves for Hope, when the old ones could no\r\nlonger, by any mending, be made to look fit for him,--what a luxury it\r\nwas!  And all the more for being secretly enjoyed.  No one out of the\r\nhouse had a suspicion how far their poverty had gone.  Mr Grey had\r\nreally been vexed at them for withdrawing from the book club; had\r\nattributed this instance of economy to the "enthusiasm" which was, in\r\nhis eyes, the fault of the family; and never dreamed of their not dining\r\non meat, vegetables, and pudding, with their glass of wine, every day.\r\nThe Greys little knew what a blessing they were conferring on their\r\ncousins, when they insisted on having them for a long day once more\r\nbefore Hester\'s confinement, and set them down to steaming soup, and a\r\nplentiful joint, and accompaniments without stint.  The guests laughed,\r\nwhen they were at home again, over the new sort of pleasure they had\r\nfelt, the delight at the sight of a good dinner, to which nothing was\r\nwanting but that Morris should have had her share.  Morris, for her\r\npart, had been very happy at home.  She had put aside for her mistress\'s\r\nluncheon next day, the broth which she had been told was for her, and\r\nhad feasted on potatoes and water, and the idea of the good dinner her\r\nyoung ladies were to enjoy.  While their affairs were in this state, it\r\nwas a great luxury in the family to have any unusual comfort which\r\nbetokened that Hope had been successful in some of his errands,--had\r\nreceived a fee, or recovered the amount of a bill.  One day, Morris\r\nbrought in a goose and giblets, which had been bought and paid for by\r\nMr Hope, the messenger said.  Another morning, came a sack of apples,\r\nfrom the orchard of a country patient who was willing to pay in kind.\r\nAt another time Edward emptied his pockets of knitted worsted stockings\r\nand mittens, the handiwork of a farmer\'s dame, who was flattered by his\r\ntaking the produce of her evening industry instead of money, which she\r\ncould not well spare at the present season.  There was more mirth, more\r\nreal gladness in the house, on the arrival of windfalls like these, than\r\nif Hope had daily exhibited a purse full of gold.  There was no sting in\r\ntheir poverty; no adventitious misery belonging to it.  They suffered\r\nits genuine force, and that was all.\r\n\r\nWhat is Poverty?  Not destitution, but poverty?  It has many shapes,--\r\naspects almost as various as the minds and circumstances of those whom\r\nit visits.  It is famine to the savage in the wilds; it is hardship to\r\nthe labourer in the cottage; it is disgrace to the proud; and to the\r\nmiser despair.  It is a spectre which "with dread of change perplexes"\r\nhim who lives at ease.  Such are its aspects: but what is it?  It is a\r\ndeficiency of the comforts of life,--a deficiency present and to come.\r\nIt involves many other things; but this is what it is.  Is it then worth\r\nall the apprehension and grief it occasions?  Is it an adequate cause\r\nfor the gloom of the merchant, the discontent of the artisan, the\r\nforeboding sighs of the mother, the ghastly dreams which haunt the\r\navaricious, the conscious debasement of the subservient, the humiliation\r\nof the proud?  These are severe sufferings; are they authorised by the\r\nnature of poverty?  Certainly not, if poverty induced no adventitious\r\nevils, involved nothing but a deficiency of the comforts of life,\r\nleaving life itself unimpaired.  "The life is more than food, and the\r\nbody than raiment;" and the untimely extinction of the life itself would\r\nnot be worth the pangs which apprehended poverty excites.  But poverty\r\ninvolves woes which, in their sum, are far greater than itself.  To a\r\nmultitude it is the loss of a pursuit which they have yet to learn will\r\nbe certainly supplied.  For such, alleviation or compensation is in\r\nstore, in the rising up of objects new, and the creation of fresh hopes.\r\nThe impoverished merchant, who may no longer look out for his argosies,\r\nmay yet be in glee when he finds it "a rare dropping morning for the\r\nearly colewort."  To another multitude, poverty involves loss of rank,--\r\na letting down among strangers whose manners are ungenial, and their\r\nthoughts unfamiliar.  For these there may be solace in retirement, or\r\nthe evil may fall short of its threats.  The reduced gentlewoman may\r\nlive in patient solitude, or may grow into sympathy with her neighbours,\r\nby raising some of them up to herself, and by warming her heart at the\r\ngreat central fire of Humanity, which burns on under the crust of\r\nmanners as rough as the storms of the tropics, or as frigid as polar\r\nsnows.  The avaricious are out of the pale of peace already, and at all\r\nevents.  Poverty is most seriously an evil to sons and daughters, who\r\nsee their parents stripped of comfort, at an age when comfort is almost\r\none with life itself: and to parents who watch the narrowing of the\r\ncapacities of their children by the pressure of poverty,--the impairing\r\nof their promise, the blotting out of their prospects.  To such mourning\r\nchildren there is little comfort, but in contemplating the easier life\r\nwhich lies behind, and (it may be hoped) the happier one which stretches\r\nbefore their parents, on the other side the postern of life.  If there\r\nis sunshine on the two grand reaches of their path, the shadow which\r\nlies in the midst is necessarily but a temporary gloom.  To grieving\r\nparents it should be a consoling truth, that as the life is more than\r\nfood, so is the soul more than instruction and opportunity, and such\r\naccomplishments as man can administer: that as the fowls are fed and the\r\nlilies clothed by Him whose hand made the air musical with the one, and\r\ndressed the fields with the other, so is the human spirit nourished and\r\nadorned by airs from heaven, which blow over the whole earth, and light\r\nfrom the skies, which no hand is permitted to intercept.  Parents know\r\nnot but that Providence may be substituting the noblest education for\r\nthe misteaching of intermediate guardians.  It may possibly be so; but\r\nif not, still there is appointed to every human being much training,\r\nmany privileges, which capricious fortune can neither give nor take\r\naway.  The father may sigh to see his boy condemned to the toil of the\r\nloom, or the gossip and drudgery of the shop, when he would fain have\r\nbeheld him the ornament of a university; but he knows not whether a more\r\nsimple integrity, a loftier disinterestedness, may not come out of the\r\nhumbler discipline than the higher privilege.  The mother\'s eyes may\r\nswim as she hears her little daughter sing her baby brother to sleep on\r\nthe cottage threshold,--her eyes may swim at the thought how those wild\r\nand moving tones might have been exalted by art.  Such art would have\r\nbeen in itself a good; but would this child then have been, as now,\r\nabout her Father\'s business, which, in ministering to one of his little\r\nones, she is as surely as the archangel who suspends new systems of\r\nworlds in the furthest void?  Her occupation is now earnest and holy;\r\nand what need the true mother wish for more?\r\n\r\nWhat is poverty to those who are not thus set in families?  What is it\r\nto the solitary, or to the husband and wife who have faith in each\r\nother\'s strength?  If they have the higher faith which usually\r\noriginates mutual trust, mere poverty is scarcely worth a passing fear.\r\nIf they have plucked out the stings of pride and selfishness, and\r\npurified their vision by faith, what is there to dread?  What is their\r\ncase?  They have life, without certainty how it is to be nourished.\r\nThey do without certainty, like "the young ravens which cry," and work\r\nfor and enjoy the subsistence of the day, leaving the morrow to take\r\ncare of what concerns it.  If living in the dreariest abodes of a town,\r\nthe light from within shines in the dark place, and, dispelling the\r\nmists of worldly care, guides to the blessing of tending the sick, and\r\nsharing the food of to-day with the orphan, and him who has no help but\r\nin them.  If the philosopher goes into such retreats with his lantern,\r\nthere may he best find the generous and the brave.  If, instead of the\r\nalleys of a city, they live under the open sky, they are yet lighter\r\nunder their poverty.  There, however blank the future may lie before\r\nthem, they have to-day the living reality of lawns and woods, and flocks\r\nin "the green pasture and beside the still waters," which silently\r\nremind them of the Shepherd, under whom they shall not want any real\r\ngood thing.  The quiet of the shady lane is theirs, and the beauty of\r\nthe blossoming thorn above the pool.  Delight steals through them with\r\nthe scent of the violet, or the new mown hay.  If they have hushed the\r\nvoices of complaint and fear within them, there is the music of the\r\nmerry lark for them, or of the leaping waterfall, or of a whole\r\norchestra of harps, when the breeze sweeps through a grove of pines.\r\nWhile it is not for fortune to "rob them of free nature\'s grace," and\r\nwhile she leaves them life and strength of limb and soul, the certainty\r\nof a future, though they cannot see what, and the assurance of\r\nprogression, though they cannot see how,--is poverty worth, for\r\nthemselves, more than a passing doubt?  Can it ever be worth the torment\r\nof fear, the bondage of subservience?--the compromise of free thought,--\r\nthe sacrifice of free speech,--the bending of the erect head, the\r\nveiling of the open brow, the repression of the salient soul?  If;\r\ninstead of this, poverty should act as the liberator of the spirit,\r\nawakening it to trust in God and sympathy for man, and placing it aloft,\r\nfresh and free, like morning on the hill-top, to survey the expanse of\r\nlife, and recognise its realities from beneath its mists, it should be\r\ngreeted with that holy joy before which all sorrow and sighing flee\r\naway.\r\n\r\nTheir poverty, which had never afflicted them very grievously, was\r\nalmost lost sight of by the corner-house family, when Hester\'s infant\r\nwas born.  They were all happy and satisfied then, though there were\r\npeople in Deerbrook who found fault with their arrangements, and were\r\nextremely scandalised when it was found that no nurse had arrived from\r\nBlickley, and that Morris took the charge of her mistress upon herself.\r\nThe Greys pronounced by their own fireside that it was a strange fancy--\r\ncarrying an affection for an old servant to a rather romantic extreme--\r\nthat it was a fresh instance of the "enthusiasm" which adversity had not\r\nyet moderated in their cousins, as might have been wished.\r\nOut-of-doors, however, Sophia vaunted the attachment of Morris to her\r\nyoung mistress--an attachment so strong, as that she would have been\r\nreally hurt if any one else had been allowed to sit up with Hester; and\r\nindeed no one could have filled her place half so much to the\r\nsatisfaction of the family--Morris had had so much experience, and was\r\nas fond of her charge as a mother could be.  No one knew what a treasure\r\nher cousins had in Morris.  All of which was true in its separate\r\nparticulars, though altogether it did not constitute the reason why\r\nHester had no nurse from Buckley.\r\n\r\nThey were happy and satisfied.  Yes, even Margaret.  This infant opened\r\nup a spring of consolation in her heart, which she could not have\r\nbelieved existed there.  On this child she could pour out some of her\r\nrepressed affections, and on him did she rest her baffled hopes.  He\r\nbeguiled her into the future, from which she had hitherto recoiled.\r\nThat helpless, unconscious little creature, cradled on her arm, and\r\nknowing nothing of its resting-place, was more powerful than sister,\r\nbrother, or friend--than self-interest, philosophy, or religion, in\r\nluring her imagination onward into future years of honour and peace.\r\nHoly and sweet was the calm of her mind, as, forgetting herself and her\r\ngriefs, she watched the first efforts of this infant to acquaint himself\r\nwith his own powers, and with the world about him; when she smiled at\r\nthe ungainly stretching of the little limbs, and the unpractised\r\nmovement of his eyes seeking the light.  Holy and sweet were the tears\r\nwhich swelled into her eyes when she saw him at his mother\'s breast, and\r\ncould not but gaze at the fresh and divine beauty now mantling on that\r\nmother\'s face, amidst the joy of this new relation.  It was a delicious\r\nmoment when Hope came in, the first day that Hester sat by the fireside,\r\nwhen he stopped short for a brief instant, as if arrested by the beauty\r\nof what he saw; and then glanced towards Margaret for sympathy.  It was\r\na delicious moment to her--the moment of that full, free, unembarrassed\r\nglance, which she had scarcely met since the first days of their\r\nacquaintance.\r\n\r\nIt was a pleasure to them all to see Hester well provided with luxuries.\r\nMaria, knowing that her surgeon would not accept money from her, took\r\nthis opportunity of sending in wine.  Oh, the pleasure of finding the\r\nneglected corkscrew, and making Morris take a glass with them!  The\r\nGreys brought game, and Hester\'s little table was well served every day.\r\nWith what zeal did Margaret apply herself, under Morris\'s teaching, to\r\ncook Hester\'s choice little dinners!  Yes, to cook them.  Margaret was\r\nlearning all Morris\'s arts from her; for, of two troubles which somewhat\r\ndisturbed this season of comfort, one was that it appeared too certain\r\nthat Morris must go, as Susan and Charles had gone before her.  No one\r\nhad expressly declared this: it was left undiscussed, apparently by\r\ncommon consent, till it should be ascertained that baby was healthy and\r\nHester getting strong; but the thought was in the minds of them all, and\r\ntheir plans involved preparation for this.\r\n\r\nThe other trouble was, that with peace and comfort, some slight, very\r\nslight symptoms recurred of Hester\'s propensity to self-torment.  It\r\ncould not be otherwise.  The wonder was, that for weeks and months she\r\nhad been relieved from her old enemy to the extent she had been.  The\r\nreverence with which her husband and sister regarded the temper, in\r\nwhich she had borne unbounded provocation, and most unmerited adversity,\r\nsometimes beguiled them into a hope that her troubles from within were\r\nover for ever; but a little reflection, and some slight experience,\r\ntaught them that this was unreasonable.  They remembered that the\r\ninfirmity of a lifetime was not to be wholly cured in half-a-year; and\r\nthat they must expect some recurrence of her old malady at times when\r\nthere was no immediate appeal to her magnanimity, and no present cause\r\nfor anxiety for those in whom she forgot herself.\r\n\r\nThe first time that Hester was in the drawing-room for the whole day,\r\nMorris was laying the cloth for dinner, and Margaret was walking up and\r\ndown the room with the baby on her arm, when Hope came in.  Hester\r\nforgot everybody and everything else when her husband appeared--a fact\r\nwhich Morris\'s benevolence was never weary of noting and commenting upon\r\nto herself.  She often wondered if ever lady loved her husband as her\r\nyoung mistress did; and she smiled to herself to see the welcome that\r\nbeamed upon Hester\'s whole face when Hope came to take his seat beside\r\nher on the sofa.  This was in her mind to-day, when her master presently\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n"Where is my boy?  I have not seen him for hours.  Why do you put him\r\nout of his father\'s way?  Oh, Margaret has him!  Come, Margaret, yield\r\nhim up.  You can have him all the hours that I am away.  You do not\r\ngrudge him to me, do you?"\r\n\r\n"My master won\'t have to complain, as many gentlemen do," said Morris,\r\n"or as many gentlemen feel, if they don\'t complain, that he is neglected\r\nfor the sake of his baby."\r\n\r\n"If you enjoy your dinner to-day, love," said Hester, "you must not give\r\nme the credit of it.  You and I are to sit down to our pheasant\r\ntogether, they tell me.  Margaret and Morris will have it that they have\r\nboth dined."\r\n\r\n"There is little in getting a comfortable dinner ready," said Morris,\r\n"whether it is the lady herself, or another, that looks to a trifle like\r\nthat.  It is the seeing his wife so full of care and thought about her\r\nbaby as to have none to spare for him, that frets many an one who does\r\nnot like to say anything about it.  Fathers cannot be so taken with a\r\nvery young baby as the mothers are, and it is mortifying to feel\r\nthemselves neglected for a newcomer.  I have often seen that, my dears;\r\nbut I shall never see it here, I find."\r\n\r\n"I do not know how you should, Morris," said Hester, in something of the\r\nold tone, which made her sister\'s heart throb almost before it reached\r\nher ear.  "Margaret will save me from any such danger.  Margaret takes\r\ncare that nobody shall be engrossed with the baby but herself.  She has\r\nnot a thought to spare for any of us while she has baby in her arms.\r\nThe little fellow has cut us all out."\r\n\r\nMargaret quickly transferred the infant to her brother\'s arm, and left\r\nthe room.  She thought it best; for her heart was very full, and she\r\ncould not speak.  She restrained her tears, and went into the kitchen to\r\nbusy herself about the dinner she had cooked.\r\n\r\n"\'Tis a fine pheasant, indeed, Miss Margaret, my dear, and beautifully\r\nroasted, I am sure: and I hope you will go up and see them enjoy it.  I\r\nam so sorry, my dear, for what I said just now.  I merely spoke what\r\ncame up in my mind when I felt pleased, and never thought of its\r\nbringing on any remark.  Nor was anything intended, I am sure, that\r\nshould make you look so sad: so do you go up, and take the baby again,\r\nwhen they sit down to dinner, as if nothing had been said.  Do, my dear,\r\nif I may venture to say so.  I will follow you with the dinner in a\r\nminute."\r\n\r\n"I wonder how it is, my love," said Hope, in a voice which spoke all the\r\ntenderness of his heart; "I wonder how it is that you can endure wrong\r\nso nobly, and that you cannot bear the natural course of events.  Tell\r\nme how it is, Hester, that you have sustained magnanimously all the\r\ninjuries and misfortunes of many months, and that you now quarrel with\r\nMargaret\'s affection for our child."\r\n\r\n"Ah why, indeed, Edward?" she replied, humbly.  "Why, but that I am\r\nunworthy that such an one as Margaret should love me and my child."\r\n\r\n"Enough, enough.  I only want to show you how I regard the case about\r\nthis new love of Margaret\'s.  Do you not see how much happier she has\r\nbeen since this little fellow was born?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes."\r\n\r\n"One may now fancy that she may be gay again.  Let us remember what an\r\noppressed heart she had, and what it must be to her to have a new\r\nobject, so innocent and unconscious as this child, to lavish her\r\naffection upon.  Do not let us grudge her the consolation, or poison the\r\npleasure of this fresh interest."\r\n\r\n"I am afraid it is done," cried Hester, in great distress.  "I was\r\nwicked--I was more cruel than any of our enemies, when I said what I\r\ndid.  I may well bear with them; for, God knows, I am at times no better\r\nthan they.  I have robbed my Margaret of her only comfort--spoiled her\r\nonly pleasure."\r\n\r\n"No, no.  Here she comes.  Look at her."\r\n\r\nMargaret\'s face was indeed serene, and she made as light of the matter\r\nas she could, when Hester implored that she would pardon her hasty and\r\ncruel words, and that she would show her forgiveness by continuing to\r\ncherish the child.  He must not begin to suffer already for his mother\'s\r\nfaults, Hester said.  There could be no doubt of Margaret\'s forgiveness,\r\nnor of her forgetfulness of what had been said, as far as forgetfulness\r\nwas possible.  But the worst of such sayings is, that they carry in them\r\nthat which prevents their being ever quite forgotten.  Hester had\r\neffectually established a constraint in her sister\'s intercourse with\r\nthe baby, and imposed upon Margaret the incessant care of scrupulously\r\nadjusting the claims of the mother and the child.  The evils arising\r\nfrom faulty temper may be borne, may be concealed, but can never be\r\nfully repaired.  Happy they whose part it is to endure and to conceal,\r\nrather than to inflict, and to strive uselessly to repair!\r\n\r\nMargaret\'s part was the easiest of the three, as they sat at the table--\r\nshe with the baby in her arms, and all agreeing that the time was come\r\nfor an explanation with Morris--for depending on themselves for almost\r\nall the work of the house.\r\n\r\n"Come, Morris," said Hester, when the cloth was removed; "you must spare\r\nus half-an-hour.  We want to consult with you.  Come and sit down."\r\n\r\nMorris came, with a foreboding heart.\r\n\r\n"It will be no news to you," said Hope, "that we are very poor.  You\r\nknow nearly as much of our affairs as we do ourselves, as it is right\r\nthat you should.  We have not wished to make any further change in our\r\ndomestic plans till this little fellow was born.  But now that he is\r\nbeginning to make his way in the world, and that his mother is well and\r\nstrong, we feel that we must consider of some further effort to spend\r\nstill less than we do now."\r\n\r\n"There are two ways in which this may be done, we think, Morris," said\r\nHester.  "We may either keep the comfort of having you with us, and\r\npinch ourselves more as to dress and the table--"\r\n\r\n"Oh! ma\'am, I hope you will not carry that any further."\r\n\r\n"Well, if we do not carry that any further, the only thing to be done, I\r\nfear, is to part with you."\r\n\r\n"Is there no other way, I wonder," said Morris, as if thinking aloud.\r\n"If it must be one of these ways, it certainly seems to me to be better\r\nfor ladies to work hard with good food, than to have a servant, and\r\nstint themselves in health and strength.  But who would have thought of\r\nmy young ladies coming to this?"\r\n\r\n"It is a situation in which hundreds and thousands are placed, Morris;\r\nand why not we, as well as they?"\r\n\r\n"May be so, ma\'am: but it grieves one, too."\r\n\r\n"Do not grieve.  I believe we all think that this parting with you is\r\nthe first real grief that our change of fortune has caused us.  Somehow\r\nor other, we have been exceedingly comfortable in our poverty.  If that\r\nhad been all, we should have had a very happy year of it."\r\n\r\n"One would desire to say nothing against what is God\'s will, ma\'am; but\r\none may be allowed, perhaps, to hope that better times will come."\r\n\r\n"I do hope it, and believe it," said her master.\r\n\r\n"And if better times come, Morris, you will return to us.  Will you\r\nnot?"\r\n\r\n"My dear, you know nothing would make me leave you now (as you say I am\r\na comfort to you) if I had any right to say I would stay.  I could live\r\nupon as little as anybody, and could do almost without any wages.  But\r\nthere is my poor sister, you know, ladies.  She depends upon me for\r\neverything, now that she cannot work herself: and I must earn money for\r\nher."\r\n\r\n"We are quite aware of that," said Margaret.  "It is for your sake and\r\nhers, quite as much as for our own, that we think we must part."\r\n\r\n"We wish to know what you would like to do," said Hester.  "Shall we try\r\nto find a situation for you near us, or would you be happier to go down\r\namong your old friends?"\r\n\r\n"I had better go where I am sure of employment, ma\'am.  Better go down\r\nto Birmingham at once.  I should never have left it but for my young\r\nladies\' sakes.  But I should be right glad, my dears, to leave it again\r\nfor you, if you can at any time write to say you wish for me back.\r\nThere is another way I have thought of sometimes; but, of course, you\r\ncannot have overlooked anything that could occur to me.  If you would\r\nall go to Birmingham, you have so many friends there, and my master\r\nwould be valued as he ought to be; which there is no sign of his being\r\nin this place.  I do not like this place, my dears.  It is not good\r\nenough for you."\r\n\r\n"We think any place good enough for us where there are men and women\r\nliving," said Hope, kindly but gravely.  "Others have thought as you do,\r\nMorris, and have offered us temptations to go away; but we do not think\r\nit right.  If we go, we shall leave behind us a bad character, which we\r\ndo not deserve.  If we stay, I have very little doubt of recovering my\r\nprofessional character, and winning over our neighbours to think better\r\nof us, and be kind to us again.  We mean to try for it, if I should have\r\nto hire myself out as a porter in Mr Grey\'s yards."\r\n\r\n"Pray, don\'t say that, sir.  But, indeed, I believe you are so far right\r\nas that the good always conquers at last."\r\n\r\n"Just so, Morris: that is what we trust.  And for the sake of this\r\nlittle fellow, if for nothing else, we must stand by our good name.  Who\r\nknows but that I may leave him a fine flourishing practice in this very\r\nplace, when I retire or die?--always supposing he means to follow his\r\nfather\'s profession."\r\n\r\n"Sir, that is looking forward very far."\r\n\r\n"So it is, Morris.  But however people may disapprove of looking forward\r\ntoo far, it is difficult to help it when they become parents.  Your\r\nmistress could tell you, if she would own the truth, that she sees her\r\nson\'s manly beauty already under that little wry mouth, and that odd\r\nbutton of a nose.  Why may not I just as well fancy him a young\r\nsurgeon?"\r\n\r\n"Morris would say, as she once said to me," observed Margaret,\r\n"`Remember death, my dear; remember death.\'"\r\n\r\n"We will remember it," said Morris, "but we must remember at the same\r\ntime God\'s mercy in giving life.  He who gave life can preserve it: and\r\nthis shall be my trust for you all, my dears, when I am far away from\r\nyou.  There is a knock!  I must go.  Oh!  Miss Margaret, who will there\r\nbe to go to the door when I am gone, but you?"\r\n\r\nMr Jones had knocked at the door, and left a letter.  These were its\r\ncontents:--\r\n\r\n  "Sir,--I hope you will excuse the liberty I take in applying to you\r\n  for my own satisfaction.  My wife and I have perceived with much\r\n  concern that we have lost much of your custom of late.  We mind little\r\n  the mere falling off of custom in any quarter, in comparison with\r\n  failing to give satisfaction.  We have always tried, I am sure, to\r\n  give satisfaction in our dealings with your family, sir; and if there\r\n  has been any offence, I can assure you it is unintentional, and shall\r\n  feel obliged by knowing what it is.  We cannot conceive, sir, where\r\n  you get your meat, if not from us; and if you have the trouble of\r\n  buying it from a distance, I can only say we should be happy to save\r\n  you the trouble, if we knew how to serve you to your liking; for, sir,\r\n  we have a great respect for you and yours.\r\n\r\n  "Your obedient servants,\r\n\r\n  "John Jones,\r\n\r\n  "Mary Jones."\r\n\r\n"The kind soul!" cried Hester.  "What must we say to them?"\r\n\r\n"We must set their minds at ease about our good-will to them.  How that\r\nlittle fellow stares about him, like a child of double his age!  I do\r\nbelieve I could make him look wise at my watch already.  Yes, we must\r\nset the Joneses at ease, at all events."\r\n\r\n"But how?  We must not tell them that we cannot afford to buy of them as\r\nwe did."\r\n\r\n"No; that would be begging.  We must trust to their delicacy not to\r\npress too closely for a reason, when once assured that we respect them\r\nas highly as they possibly can us."\r\n\r\n"You may trust them," said Margaret, "I am convinced.  They will look in\r\nyour face, and be satisfied without further question; and my advice,\r\ntherefore, is, that you do not write, but go."\r\n\r\n"I will; and now.  They shall not suffer a moment\'s pain that I can save\r\nthem.  Good-night, my boy!  What! you have not learned to kiss yet.\r\nWell, among us all, you will soon know how, if teaching will do it.\r\nWhat a spirit he has!  I fancy he will turn out like Frank."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY NINE.\r\n\r\nTHE LONG NIGHTS.\r\n\r\nAlmost as soon as Hope had left the house, Sydney Grey arrived, looking\r\nfull of importance.  He took care to shut the door before he would tell\r\nhis errand.  His mother had been obliged to trust him for want of\r\nanother messenger; and he delivered his message with a little of the\r\nparade of mystery he had derived from her.  Mr Grey\'s family had become\r\nuneasy about his returning from the markets in the evening, since\r\nrobberies had become so frequent as they now were, and the days so\r\nshort; and had at length persuaded him to sleep at the more distant\r\nmarket-towns he had to visit, and return the next morning.  From\r\nBlickley he could get home before the evening closed in; but on two days\r\nin the week he was to remain out all night.  When he had agreed to this,\r\nhis family had applauded him and felt satisfied: but as the evening drew\r\non, on occasion of this his first absence, Mrs Grey and Sophia had\r\ngrown nervous on their own account.  They recalled story after story,\r\nwhich they had lately heard, of robberies at several solitary houses in\r\nthe country round; and, though their house was not solitary, they could\r\nnot reconcile themselves to going to rest without the comfort of knowing\r\nthat there was, as usual, a strong man on their premises.  If they had\r\nbeen aware how many strong men there were sometimes on their premises at\r\nnight, they would not have been satisfied with having one within their\r\nwalls.  Not having been informed, however, how cleverly their dogs were\r\nsilenced, how much poached game was divided under the shelter of their\r\nstacks of deals, and what dextrous abstractions were at such times made\r\nfrom the store of corn in their granaries, and coal in their lighters,\r\nthey proposed nothing further than to beg the favour of Mr Hope that he\r\nwould take a bed in their house for this one night.  They dared not\r\nengage any of the men from the yards to defend them; they had not Mr\r\nGrey\'s leave, and he might not be pleased if they showed any fear to\r\ntheir own servants: but it would be the greatest comfort if Mr Hope\r\nwould come, as if to supper, and stay the night.  The spare room was\r\nready; and Mrs Grey hoped he would not object to leaving his family\r\njust for once.  Mr Grey intended to do the same thing twice a week,\r\ntill the days should lengthen, and the roads become safer.\r\n\r\nThough Sydney made the most of his message, he declared himself not\r\nthoroughly pleased with it.\r\n\r\n"They might have trusted me to take care of them," said he.  "If they\r\nhad just let me have my father\'s pistols--."\r\n\r\n"Come, come, Sydney, do not talk of pistols," said Hester, who did not\r\nrelish any part of the affair.\r\n\r\n"He would not talk of them if he thought they were likely to be wanted,"\r\nobserved Margaret.\r\n\r\n"Likely! when were they ever more likely to be wanted, I should like to\r\nknow!  Did you hear what happened at the Russell Taylors\' last night?"\r\n\r\n"No; and we do not wish to hear.  Do not tell us any horrible stories,\r\nunless you mean my husband to stay at home to-night."\r\n\r\n"Oh, you must just hear this, because it ended well; that is, nobody was\r\nkilled.  Mr Walcot told Sophia all about it this morning; and it was\r\npartly that which made her so anxious to have some one sleep in the\r\nhouse to-night."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, do not tell us, or you will make us anxious for the same\r\nthing."\r\n\r\n"What would your mother say if you were to carry home word that Mr Hope\r\ncould not come--that his family dare not part with him?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, then she must let me have my father\'s pistols, and watch for the\r\nfellows.  If they came about our windows as they did about the Russell\r\nTaylors\', how I would let fly among them!  They came rapping at the\r\nshutters, at two this morning; and when Mr Taylor looked out from his\r\nbedroom above, they said they would not trouble themselves to get in, if\r\nhe would throw out his money!"\r\n\r\n"And did he?"\r\n\r\n"Yes.  They raised a hat upon a pole, and he put in four or five\r\npounds--all he had in the house, he told them.  So they went away; but\r\nnone of the family thought of going to bed again."\r\n\r\n"I dare say not.  And what sort of thieves are these supposed to be?\r\nThey set about their business very oddly."\r\n\r\n"Not like London thieves," said Sydney, consequentially, as if he knew\r\nall about London thieves.  "They are the distressed country people, no\r\ndoubt--such as would no more think of standing a second shot from my\r\npistol, than of keeping the straits of Thermopylae.  Look here," he\r\ncontinued, showing the end of a pistol, which peeped from a pocket\r\ninside his coat; "here\'s a thing that will put such gentry into a fine\r\ntaking."\r\n\r\n"Pray, is that pistol loaded?" inquired Hester, pressing her infant to\r\nher.\r\n\r\n"To be sure.  What is the use of a pistol if it is not loaded?  It might\r\nas well be in the shop as in my pocket, then.  Look at her, cousin\r\nMargaret!  If she is not in as great a fright as the cowardly thieves!\r\nWhy, cousin Hester, don\'t you see, if this pistol went off, it would not\r\nshoot you or the baby.  It would go straight through me."\r\n\r\n"That is a great comfort.  But I had rather you would go away, you and\r\nyour pistol.  Pray, does your mother know that you carry one?"\r\n\r\n"No.  Mind you don\'t tell her.  I trust you not to tell her.  Remember,\r\nI would not have told you if I had not felt sure of you."\r\n\r\n"You had better not have felt sure of us.  However, we will not tell\r\nyour mother; but my husband will tell Mr Grey to-morrow, when he comes\r\nhome.  If he chooses that you should carry loaded pistols about, there\r\nwill be no harm done."\r\n\r\n"I have a great mind to say I will shoot you if you tell," cried Sydney,\r\npresenting the pistol with a grand air.  But he saw that he made his\r\ncousins really uneasy, and he laid it down on the table, offering to\r\nleave it with them for the night, if they thought it would make them\r\nfeel any safer.  There were plenty more at home.\r\n\r\n"Thank you," said Margaret, "but I believe we are more afraid of loaded\r\npistols than of thieves.  The sooner you take it away the better.  You\r\ncan go now, presently, for here comes my brother."\r\n\r\nSydney quickly pocketed his pistol.  Hope agreed to go, and promised to\r\nbe at Mr Grey\'s to supper by nine o\'clock.\r\n\r\nMargaret was incessantly thinking of Maria in these long evenings, when\r\nalarms of one kind or another were all abroad.  She now thought she\r\nwould go with Sydney, and spend an hour or two with Maria, returning by\r\nthe time her brother would be going to the Greys\'.  Maria\'s landlord\r\nwould see her home, no doubt.\r\n\r\nShe found her friend busy with book and needle, and as well in health as\r\nusual, but obviously somewhat moved by the dismal stories which had\r\ntravelled from mouth to mouth through Deerbrook during the day.  It\r\nseemed hardly right that any person in delicate health should be lonely\r\nat such a time; and it occurred to Margaret that her friend might like\r\nto go home with her, and occupy the bed which was this night to spare.\r\nMaria thankfully accepted the offer, and let Margaret put up her little\r\nbundle for her.  The farrier escorted them to the steps of the\r\ncorner-house, and then left them.\r\n\r\nThe door was half-open, as Morris was talking with some one on the mat\r\nin the hall.  An extremely tall woman, with a crying baby in her arms,\r\nmade way for the ladies, not by going out of the house, but by stepping\r\nfurther into the hall.\r\n\r\n"Morris, had you not better shut the door?" said Margaret; "the wind\r\nblows in so, it is enough to chill the whole house."\r\n\r\nBut Morris held the door open, rather wider than before.\r\n\r\n"So the gentleman is not at home," said the tall woman, gruffly.  "If I\r\ncome again in an hour with my poor baby, will he be at home then?"\r\n\r\n"Is my brother gone, Morris?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Miss, three minutes ago."\r\n\r\n"Then he will not be back in an hour.  We do not expect him--."\r\n\r\n"This good woman had better go to Mr Walcot, ma\'am, as I have been\r\ntelling her.  There\'s no doubt he is at home."\r\n\r\n"I could wait here till the gentleman comes home," said the tall woman;\r\n"and so get the first advice for my poor baby.  \'Tis very ill, ma\'am."\r\n\r\n"Better go to Mr Walcot," persisted Morris.\r\n\r\n"Or to my brother at Mr Grey\'s," said Margaret, unwilling to lose the\r\nchance of a new patient for Edward, and thinking his advice better, for\r\nthe child\'s sake, than Mr Walcot\'s.\r\n\r\n"It is far the readiest way to go to Mr Walcot\'s," declared Maria,\r\nwhose arm Margaret felt to tremble within her own.\r\n\r\n"I believe you are right," said Margaret.  "You had better not waste any\r\nmore time here, good woman.  It may make all the difference to your\r\nchild."\r\n\r\n"If you would let me wait till the gentleman comes home," said the tall\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\n"Impossible.  It is too late to-night for patients to wait.  This lady\'s\r\nlandlord, without there, will show you the way to Mr Walcot\'s.  Call\r\nhim, Morris."\r\n\r\nMorris went out upon the steps, but the tall woman passed her, and was\r\ngone.  Morris stepped in briskly, and put up the chain.\r\n\r\n"You were very ready to send a new patient to Mr Walcot, Morris," said\r\nMargaret, smiling.\r\n\r\n"I had a fancy that it was a sort of patient that my master would not be\r\nthe better for," replied Morris.  "I did not like the looks of the\r\nperson."\r\n\r\n"Nor I," said Maria.\r\n\r\nThe drawing-room door was heard to open, and Morris put her finger on\r\nher lips.  Hester had been alone nearly ten minutes; she was growing\r\nnervous, and wanted to know what all this talking in the hall was about.\r\nShe was told that Mr Hope had been inquired for, about a sick baby;\r\nand the rest of the discourse went to the account of Maria\'s unexpected\r\narrival.  Hester welcomed Maria kindly, ordered up the cold pheasant and\r\nthe wine, and then, leaving the friends to enjoy themselves over the\r\nfire, retired to rest.  Morris was desired to go too, as she still slept\r\nin her mistress\'s room, and ought to keep early hours, since, in\r\naddition to her labours of the day, she was at the baby\'s call in the\r\nnight.  Margaret would see her friend to her room.  Morris must not\r\nremain up on their account.\r\n\r\n"How comfortable this is!" cried Maria, in a gleeful tone, as she looked\r\nround upon the crackling fire, the tray, the wine, and her companion.\r\n"How unlooked for, to pass a whole evening and night without being\r\nafraid of anything!"\r\n\r\n"What an admission from you!--that you are afraid of something every\r\nnight."\r\n\r\n"That is just the plain truth.  When I used to read about the horrors of\r\nliving in a solitary house in the country, I little thought how much of\r\nthe same terror I should feel from living solitary in a house in a\r\nvillage.  You wonder what could happen to me, I dare say; and perhaps it\r\nwould not be very easy to suppose any peril which would stand\r\nexamination."\r\n\r\n"I was going to say that you and we are particularly safe, from being so\r\npoor that there is no inducement to rob us.  We and you have neither\r\nmoney nor jewels, nor plate, that can tempt thieves!--for our few forks\r\nand spoons are hardly worth breaking into a house for."\r\n\r\n"People who want bread, however, may think it worth while to break in\r\nfor that: and while our thieves are this sort of people, and not the\r\nLondon gentry whom Sydney is so fond of talking of, it may be enough\r\nthat gentlemen and ladies live in houses to make the starving suppose\r\nthat they shall find something valuable there."\r\n\r\n"They would soon learn better if they came here.  I doubt whether, when\r\nyou and I have done our supper, they would find anything to eat.  But\r\nhow do you show your terrors, I should like to know?  Do you scream?"\r\n\r\n"I never screamed in my life, as far as I remember.  Screaming appears\r\nto me the most unnatural of human sounds.  I never felt the slightest\r\ninclination to express myself in that manner."\r\n\r\n"Nor I: but I never said so, because I thought no one would believe me."\r\n\r\n"No: the true mood for these doleful winter nights is, to sit trying to\r\nread, but never able to fix your attention for five minutes, for some\r\nodd noise or another.  And yet it is almost worse to hear nothing but a\r\ncinder falling on the hearth now and then, startling you like a\r\npistol-shot.  Then it seems as if somebody was opening the shutter\r\noutside, and then tapping at the window.  I have got so into the habit\r\nof looking at the window at night, expecting to see a face squeezed flat\r\nagainst the pane, that I have yielded up my credit to myself, and\r\nactually have the blinds drawn down when the outside shutters are\r\nclosed."\r\n\r\n"How glad I am to find you are no braver than the rest of us!"\r\n\r\n"No; do not be glad.  It is very painful, night after night.  Every step\r\nclinks or craunches in the farrier\'s yard, you know.  This ought to be a\r\ncomfort: but sometimes I cannot clearly tell where the sound comes from.\r\nMore than once lately I have fancied it was behind me, and have turned\r\nround in a greater hurry than you would think I could use.  My rooms are\r\na good way from the rest of the house; you remember the length of the\r\npassage between.  I do not like disturbing the family in the evenings;\r\nbut I have been selfish enough to ring, once or twice this week, without\r\nany sufficient reason, just for the sake of a sight of my landlady."\r\n\r\n"A very sufficient reason.  But I had no idea of all this from you."\r\n\r\n"You have heard me say some fine things about the value of time to me--\r\nabout the blessings of my long evenings.  For all that (true as it is),\r\nI have got into the way of going to bed soon after ten, just because I\r\nknow every one else in the house is in bed, and I do not like to be the\r\nonly person up."\r\n\r\n"That is the reason why you are looking so well, notwithstanding all\r\nthese terrors.  But, Maria, what has become of your bravery?"\r\n\r\n"It is just where it was.  I am no more afraid than I used to be of\r\nevils which may be met with a mature mind: and just as much afraid as\r\never of those which terrified my childhood."\r\n\r\n"Our baby shall never be afraid of anything," asserted Margaret.  "But\r\nMaria, something must be done for your relief."\r\n\r\n"That is just what I hoped and expected you would say, and the reason\r\nwhy I exposed myself to you."\r\n\r\n"Why do not the Greys offer you a room there for the winter?  That seems\r\nthe simplest and most obvious plan."\r\n\r\n"It is not convenient."\r\n\r\n"How should that be?"\r\n\r\n"The bed would have to be uncovered, you know; and the mahogany\r\nwash-stand might be splashed."\r\n\r\n"They can get a room ready for a guest, to relieve their own fears, but\r\nnot yours.  Can nothing be done about it?"\r\n\r\n"Not unless the Rowlands should take in Mr Walcot, because he is afraid\r\nto live alone: in such case, the Greys would take me in for the same\r\nreason.  But that will not be so, Margaret, I will ask you plainly, and\r\nyou will answer as plainly--could you, without too much pain, trouble,\r\nand inconvenience, spend an evening or two a week with me, just till\r\nthis panic is passed?  If you could put it in my power to be always\r\nlooking forward to an evening of relief, it would break the sense of\r\nsolitude, and make all the difference to me.  I see the selfishness of\r\nthis; but I really think it is better to own my weakness than to\r\nstruggle uselessly against it any longer."\r\n\r\n"I could do that--should like of all things to do it till Morris goes:\r\nbut that will be so soon--."\r\n\r\n"Morris! where is she going?"\r\n\r\nMargaret related this piece of domestic news, too private to be told to\r\nany one else till the last moment.  Maria forgot her own troubles, or\r\ndespised them as she listened, so grieved was she for her friends,\r\nincluding Morris.  Margaret was not very sorry on Morris\'s own account.\r\nMorris wanted rest--an easier place.  She had had too much upon her for\r\nsome time past.\r\n\r\n"What then will you have, when she is gone?"\r\n\r\n"If I have work enough to drive all thought out of my head, I shall be\r\nthankful.  Meantime, I will bestow my best wit upon your case."\r\n\r\n"I am ashamed of my case already.  While sitting in all this comfort\r\nhere, I can hardly believe in my own tremors, of no earlier date than\r\nlast night.  Come, let us draw to the fire.  I hope we shall not end\r\nwith sitting up all night; but I feel as if I should like it very much."\r\n\r\nMargaret stirred up a blaze, and put out the candles.  No economy was\r\nnow beneath her care.  As she took her seat beside her friend, she said:\r\n\r\n"Maria, did you ever know any place so dull and dismal as Deerbrook is\r\nnow?  Is it not enough to make any heart as heavy as the fortunes of the\r\nplace?"\r\n\r\n"Even the little that I see of it, in going to and from the Greys, looks\r\nsad enough.  You see the outskirts, which I suppose are worse still."\r\n\r\n"The very air feels too heavy to breathe.  The cottages, and even the\r\nbetter houses, appear to my eyes damp and weather-stained on the\r\noutside, and silent within.  The children sit shivering on the\r\nthresholds--do not they?--instead of shouting at their play as they did.\r\nEvery one looks discontented, and complains--the poor of want of bread,\r\nand every one else of hard times, and all manner of woes, that one never\r\nhears of in prosperous seasons.  Mr James says the actions for trespass\r\nare beyond all example; Mr Tucker declares his dog, that died the other\r\nday, was poisoned; and I never pass the Green but the women are even\r\nquarrelling for precedence at the pump."\r\n\r\n"I have witnessed some of this, but not all: and neither, I suspect,\r\nhave you, Margaret, though you think you have.  We see the affairs of\r\nthe world in shadow, you know, when our own hearts are sad."\r\n\r\n"My heart is not so sad as you think.  You do not believe me: but that\r\nis because you do not believe what I am sure of--that he is not to blame\r\nfor anything that has happened--that, at least, he has only been\r\nmistaken,--that there his been no fickleness, no selfishness, in him.  I\r\ncould not speak of this, even to you, Maria, if it were not a duty to\r\nhim.  You must not be left to suppose from my silence that he is to\r\nblame, as you think he is.  I suffer from no sense of injury from him.\r\nI got over that, long ago."\r\n\r\nMaria would not say, as she thought, "You had to get over it, then?"\r\n\r\n"It makes me very unhappy to think how he is suffering,--how much more\r\nhe has to bear than I; so much more than the separation and the blank.\r\nHe cannot trust me as I trusted him; and that is, indeed, to be without\r\nconsolation."\r\n\r\n"Do men ever trust as women do?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Edward does.  If he were to go to India for twenty years, he would\r\nknow, as certainly as I should, that Hester would be widowed in every\r\nthought till his return.  And the time will come when Philip will know\r\nthis as certainly of me.  It is but a little while yet that I have\r\nwaited, Maria; but it does sometimes seem a weary waiting."\r\n\r\nMaria took her friend\'s hand, in token of the sympathy she could not\r\nspeak,--so much of hopelessness was there mingled with it.\r\n\r\n"I know you and others think that this waiting is to go on for ever."\r\n\r\n"No, love; not so."\r\n\r\n"Or that a certainty which is even worse will come some day.  But it\r\nwill be otherwise.  His love can no more be quenched or alienated by the\r\nslanders of a wicked woman, than the sun can be put out by an eclipse,\r\nor sent to enlighten another world, leaving us mourning."\r\n\r\n"You judge by your own soul, Margaret; and that should be a faithful\r\nguide.  You judge him by your own soul,--and how much by this?" she\r\nadded, with a smile, fixing her eyes on the turquoise ring, which was\r\nPhilip\'s gift, and which, safely guarded, was on a finger of the hand\r\nshe held.\r\n\r\nMargaret blushed.  She could not have denied, if closely pressed, that\r\nsome little tinge of the Eastern superstition had entered into this\r\nsacred ring, and lay there, like the fire in the opal.  She could not\r\nhave denied, that, when she drew it on every morning, she noted with\r\nsatisfaction that its blue was as clear and bright as ever.\r\n\r\n"How is it that this ring is still here?" asked Maria.  "Is it possible\r\nthat he retains gifts of yours?  Yet, I think, if he did not, this ring\r\nwould not be on your finger."\r\n\r\n"He does keep whatever I gave him.  Thank God! he keeps them.  This is\r\none of my greatest comforts: it is the only way I have left of speaking\r\nto him.  But if it were not so, this ring would still be where it is.  I\r\nwould not give it up.  I am not altered.  I am not angry with him.  His\r\nlove is as precious to me as it ever was, and I will not give up the\r\ntokens of it.  Why, Maria, you surely cannot suppose that these things\r\nhave any other value or use but as given by him!  You cannot suppose\r\nthat I dread the imputation of keeping them for their own sakes!"\r\n\r\n"No: but--"\r\n\r\n"But what?"\r\n\r\n"Is any proof of his former regard of value now?  That is the question.\r\nIt has only very lately become a question with me.  I have only lately\r\nlearned to think him in fault.  I excused him before...  I excused him\r\nas long as I could."\r\n\r\n"You will unlearn your present opinion of him.  Yes; everything that was\r\never valuable from him is more precious than ever now,--now that he is\r\nunder a spell, and cannot speak his soul.  If it were, as you think, if\r\nhe loved me no longer, they would be still more precious, as a relic of\r\nthe dead.  But it is not so."\r\n\r\n"If faith can remove mountains, we may have to rejoice for you still,\r\nMargaret; for there can be no mass of calumnies between you and him\r\nwhich you have not faith enough to overthrow."\r\n\r\n"Thank you for that.  It is the best word of comfort that has come to me\r\nfrom without for many a day.  Now there is one thing more in which you\r\ncan perhaps help me.  I have heard nothing about him for so long!  You\r\nsee Mr Rowland sometimes (I know he feels a great friendship for you);\r\nand you meet the younger children.  Do you hear nothing whatever about\r\n_him_?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing: nor do they.  Mr Rowland told me, a fortnight ago, that Mrs\r\nRowland and he are seriously uneasy at obtaining no answers to their\r\nrepeated letters to Mr Enderby.  Mrs Rowland is more disturbed, I\r\nbelieve, than she chooses to show.  She must feel herself responsible.\r\nShe has tried various means of accounting for his silence, all the\r\nautumn.  Now she gives that up, and is silent in her turn.  If it were\r\nnot for the impossibility of leaving home at such a time as this, Mr\r\nRowland would go to London to satisfy himself.  Margaret, I believe you\r\nare the only person who has smiled at this."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps I am the only one who understands him.  I had rather know of\r\nthis silence than of all the letters he could have written to Mrs\r\nRowland.  If he had been ill, they would certainly have heard."\r\n\r\n"Yes; they say so."\r\n\r\n"Then that is enough.  Let us say no more now."\r\n\r\n"You have said that which has cheered me for you, Margaret, though, as\r\nwe poor irreligious human beings often say to each other, `I wish I had\r\nyour faith.\'  You have given me more than I had, however.  But are we to\r\nsay no more about anything?  Must we leave this comfortable fire, and go\r\nto sleep?"\r\n\r\n"Not unless you wish it.  I have more to ask, if you are not tired."\r\n\r\n"Come, ask me."\r\n\r\n"Cannot you tell me of some way in which a woman may earn money?"\r\n\r\n"A woman?  What rate of woman?  Do you mean yourself?  That question is\r\neasily answered.  A woman from the uneducated classes can get a\r\nsubsistence by washing and cooking, by milking cows and going to\r\nservice, and, in some parts of the kingdom, by working in a cotton mill,\r\nor burnishing plate, as you have no doubt seen for yourself at\r\nBirmingham.  But, for an educated woman, a woman with the powers which\r\nGod gave her, religiously improved, with a reason which lays life open\r\nbefore her, an understanding which surveys science as its appropriate\r\ntask, and a conscience which would make every species of responsibility\r\nsafe,--for such a woman there is in all England no chance of subsistence\r\nbut by teaching--that almost ineffectual teaching, which can never\r\ncountervail the education of circumstances, and for which not one in a\r\nthousand is fit--or by being a superior Miss Nares--the feminine gender\r\nof the tailor and the hatter."\r\n\r\n"The tutor, the tailor, and the hatter.  Is this all?"\r\n\r\n"All; except that there are departments of art and literature from which\r\nit is impossible to shut women out.  These are not, however, to be\r\nregarded as resources for bread.  Besides the number who succeed in art\r\nand literature being necessarily extremely small, it seems pretty\r\ncertain that no great achievements, in the domains of art and\r\nimagination, can be looked for from either men or women who labour there\r\nto supply their lower wants, or for any other reason than the pure love\r\nof their work.  While they toil in any one of the arts of expression, if\r\nthey are not engrossed by some loftier meaning, the highest which they\r\nwill end with expressing will be, the need of bread."\r\n\r\n"True--quite true.  I must not think of any of those higher departments\r\nof labour, because, even if I were qualified, what I want is not\r\nemployment, but money.  I am anxious to earn some money, Maria.  We are\r\nvery poor.  Edward is trying, one way and another, to earn money to live\r\nupon, till his practice comes back to him, as he is for ever trusting it\r\nwill.  I wish to earn something too, if it be ever so little.  Can you\r\ntell me of no way?"\r\n\r\n"I believe I should not if I could.  Why?  Because I think you have\r\nquite enough to do already, and will soon have too much.  Just consider.\r\nWhen Morris goes, what hour of the day will you have to spare?  Let us\r\nsee;--do you mean to sweep the rooms with your own hands?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Margaret, smiling.\r\n\r\n"And to scour them too?"\r\n\r\n"No; not quite that.  We shall hire a neighbour to come two or three\r\ntimes a week to do the rougher parts of the work.  But I mean to light\r\nthe fire in the morning (and we shall have but one), and get breakfast\r\nready; and Hester will help me to make the beds.  That is nearly all I\r\nshall let her do besides the sewing; for baby will give her employment\r\nenough."\r\n\r\n"Indeed, I think so; and that will leave you too much.  Do not think,\r\ndear, of earning money.  You are doing all you ought in saving it."\r\n\r\n"I must think about it, because earning is so much nobler and more\r\neffectual than saving.  I cannot help seeing that it would be far better\r\nto earn the amount of Morris\'s maintenance, than to save it by doing her\r\nwork badly myself.  Not that I shrink from the labour: I am rather\r\nenjoying the prospect of it, as I told you.  Hark! what footstep is\r\nthat?"\r\n\r\n"I heard it a minute or two ago," whispered Maria, "but I did not like\r\nto mention it."\r\n\r\nThey listened in the deepest silence for a while.  At first they were\r\nnot sure whether they heard anything above the beating of their own\r\nhearts; but they were soon certain that there were feet moving outside\r\nthe room door.\r\n\r\n"The church clock has but lately gone twelve," said Maria, in the faint\r\nhope that it might be some one of the household yet stirring.\r\n\r\nMargaret shook her head.  She rose softly from her seat, and took a\r\ncandle from the table to light it, saying she would go and see.  Her\r\nhand trembled a little as she held the match, and the candle would not\r\nimmediately light.  Meantime, the door opened without noise, and some\r\none walked in and quite up to the gazing ladies.  It was the tall woman.\r\nMaria made an effort to reach the bell, but the tall woman seized her\r\narm, and made her sit down.  A capricious jet of flame from a coal in\r\nthe fire at this moment lighted up the face of the stranger for a\r\nmoment, and enabled Maria to "spy a creat peard under the muffler."\r\n\r\n"What do you want at this time?" said Margaret.\r\n\r\n"I want money, and what else I can get," said the intruder, in the no\r\nlonger disguised voice of a man.  "I have been into your larder, but you\r\nseem to have nothing there."\r\n\r\n"That is true," said Margaret, firmly; "nor have we any money.  We are\r\nvery poor.  You could not have come to a worse place, if you are in\r\nwant."\r\n\r\n"Here is something, however," said the man, turning to the tray.  "With\r\nyour leave, I\'ll see what you have left us to eat."\r\n\r\nHe thrust one of the candles between the bars of the grate to light it,\r\ntelling the ladies they had better start no difficulty, lest they should\r\nhave reason to repent it.  There were others with him in the house, who\r\nwould show themselves in an instant, if any noise were made.\r\n\r\n"Then do you make none--I beg it as a favour," said Margaret.  "There is\r\na lady asleep up-stairs, with a very young infant.  If you respect her\r\nlife you will be quiet."\r\n\r\nThe man did not answer, but he was quiet.  He cut slices from the loaf,\r\nand carried them to the door, and they were taken by somebody outside.\r\nHe quickly devoured the remains of the pheasant, tearing the meat from\r\nthe bones with his teeth.  He drank from the decanter of wine, and then\r\ncarried it where he had taken the bread.  Two men put their heads in at\r\nthe door, nodded to the ladies before they drank, and again withdrew.\r\nThe girls cast a look at each other--a glance of agreement that\r\nresistance was not to be thought of: yet each was conscious of a feeling\r\nof rather pleasant surprise that she was not more alarmed.\r\n\r\n"Now for it!" said the man, striding oddly about in his petticoats, and\r\nevidently out of patience with them.  "Now for your money!"  As he\r\nspoke, he put the spoons from the tray into the bosom of his gown,\r\nproceeding to murmur at his deficiency of pockets.\r\n\r\nMargaret held out her purse to him.  It contained one single shilling.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t mean this is all you are going to give me?"\r\n\r\n"It is all I have: and I believe there is not another shilling in the\r\nhouse.  I told you we have no money."\r\n\r\n"And you?" said he, turning to Maria.\r\n\r\n"I have not my purse about me; and if I had there is nothing in it worth\r\nyour taking.  I assure you I have not got my purse.  I am only a visitor\r\nhere for this one night--and an odd night it is to have chosen, as it\r\nturns out."\r\n\r\n"Give me your watches."\r\n\r\n"I have no watch.  I have not had a watch these five years," said Maria.\r\n\r\n"I have no watch," said Margaret.  "I sold mine a month ago.  I told you\r\nwe were very poor."\r\n\r\nThe man muttered something about the plague of gentlefolks being so\r\npoor, and about wondering that gentlefolks were not ashamed of being so\r\npoor.  "You have got something, however," he continued, fixing his eye\r\non the ring on Margaret\'s finger.  "Give me that ring.  Give it me, or\r\nelse I\'ll take it."\r\n\r\nMargaret\'s heart sank with a self-reproach worse than her grief, when\r\nshe remembered how easily she might have saved this ring--how easily she\r\nmight have thrust it under the fender, or dropped it into her shoe, into\r\nher hair, anywhere, while the intruder was gone to the room door to his\r\ncompanions.  She felt that she could never forgive herself for this\r\nneglect of the most precious thing she had in the world--of that which\r\nmost belonged to Philip.\r\n\r\n"She cannot part with that ring," said Maria.  "Look! you may see she\r\nhad rather part with any money she is ever likely to have than with that\r\nring."\r\n\r\nShe pointed to Margaret, who was sitting with her hands clasped as if\r\nthey were never to be disjoined, and with a face of the deepest\r\ndistress.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t help that," said the man.  "I must have what I can get."\r\n\r\nHe seized her hands, and, with one gripe of his, made hers fly open.\r\nMargaret could no longer endure to expose any of her feelings to the\r\nnotice of a stranger of this character.  "Be patient a moment," said\r\nshe; and she drew off the ring after its guard, made of Hester\'s hair,\r\nand put them into the large hand which was held out to receive them;\r\nfeeling, at the moment, as if her heart was breaking.  The man threw the\r\nhair ring back into her lap, and tied the turquoise in the corner of the\r\nshawl he wore.\r\n\r\n"The lady up-stairs has got a watch, I suppose."\r\n\r\n"Yes, she has: let me go and fetch it.  Do let me go.  I am afraid of\r\nnothing so much as her being terrified.  If you have any humanity, let\r\nme go.  Indeed I will bring the watch."\r\n\r\n"Well, there is no man in the house, I know, for you to call.  You may\r\ngo, Miss: but I must step behind you to the room door; no further--she\r\nshan\'t see me, nor know any one is there, unless you tell her.  This\r\nyoung lady will sit as still as a mouse till we come back."\r\n\r\n"Never mind me," said Maria, to her friend.  While they were gone, she\r\nsat as she was desired, as still as a mouse, enforced thereto by the\r\ncertainty that a man stood in the shadow by the door, with his eye upon\r\nher the whole time.\r\n\r\nMargaret lighted a chamber candle, in order, as she said, to look as\r\nusual if her sister should see her.  The robber did tread very softly on\r\nthe stairs, and stop outside the chamber-door.  Morris was sitting up in\r\nher truckle-bed, evidently listening, and was on the point of starting\r\nout of it on seeing that Margaret\'s face was pale, when Margaret put her\r\nfinger on her lips, and motioned to her to lie down.  Hester was asleep,\r\nwith her sleeping infant on her arm.  Margaret set down the light, and\r\nleaned over her, to take the watch from its hook at the head of the bed.\r\n\r\n"Are you still up?" said Hester, drowsily, and just opening her eyes.\r\n"What do you want?  It must be very late."\r\n\r\n"Nearly half-past twelve, by your watch.  I am sorry I disturbed you.\r\nGood-night."\r\n\r\nAs she withdrew with the watch in her hand, she whispered to Morris:\r\n\r\n"Lie still.  Don\'t be uneasy.  I will come again presently."  So, in a\r\nfew minutes, as seemed to intently listening ears, the house was clear\r\nof the intruders.  Within a quarter of an hour Margaret had beckoned\r\nMorris out of Hester\'s room, and had explained the case to her.  They\r\nwent round the house, and found that all the little plate they had was\r\ngone, and the cheese from the pantry.  Morris\'s cloth cloak was left\r\nhanging on its pin, and even Edward\'s old hat.  From these\r\ncircumstances, and from the dialect of the only speaker, Margaret\r\nthought the thieves must be country people from the neighbourhood, who\r\ncould not wear the old clothes of the gentry without danger of\r\ndetection.  They had come in from the surgery, whose outer door was\r\nsufficiently distant from the inhabited rooms of the house to be forced\r\nwithout the noise being heard.  Morris and Margaret barricaded this door\r\nas well as they could, with such chests and benches as they were able to\r\nmove without making themselves heard up-stairs: and then Morris, at\r\nMargaret\'s earnest desire, stole back to bed.  Anything rather than\r\nalarm Hester.\r\n\r\nWhile they were below, Maria had put on more coals, and restored some\r\norder and comfort to the table and the fireside.  She concluded that\r\nsleep was out of the question for this night.  For some moments after\r\nMargaret came and sat down by her, neither of them spoke.  At length\r\nMargaret said, half laughing:\r\n\r\n"That you should have come here for rest this night, of all nights in\r\nthe year!"\r\n\r\n"I am glad it happened so.  Yes; indeed, I am.  I know it must have been\r\na comfort to you to have some one with you, though only poor lame me.\r\nAnd I am glad on my own account too, I assure you.  Such a visitation is\r\nnot half so dreadful as I had fancied--not worth half the fear I have\r\nspent upon it all my life.  I am sure you felt as I did while he was\r\nhere; you felt quite yourself, did not you?  If it had not been for the\r\nwoman\'s clothes, it would really have been scarcely terrifying at all.\r\nThere is something much more human about a housebreaker than I had\r\nfancied.  But yet it was very inhuman of him to take your ring."\r\n\r\nMargaret wept more bitterly than any one had seen her weep since her\r\nunhappy days began, and her friend could not comfort her.  It was a case\r\nin which there was no comfort to be given, unless in the very faint and\r\nunreasonable hope that the ring might be offered for sale to some\r\njeweller in some market town in the county; a hope sadly faint and\r\nunreasonable; since country people who would take plate and ornaments\r\nmust, in all probability, be in communication with London rogues, who\r\nwould turn the property into money in the great city.  Still, there was\r\na possibility of recovering the lost treasure; and on this possibility\r\nMaria dwelt perseveringly.\r\n\r\n"But, Margaret," she went on to ask, "what is this about your watch?\r\nHave you indeed sold it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes.  Morris managed that for me while Hester was confined.  I am glad\r\nnow that I parted with it as I did.  It has paid some bills which I know\r\nmade Edward anxious; and that is far better than its being in a\r\nhousebreaker\'s hands."\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed: but I am sorry you all have such a struggle to live.  Not\r\na shilling in the house but the one you gave up!"\r\n\r\n"So much for Edward\'s being out.  It happened very well; for he could\r\nnot have helped us, if he had been here.  You saw there were three of\r\nthem.  What I meant was, that Edward has about him the little money that\r\nis to last us till Christmas.  The rent is safe enough.  It is in Mr\r\nGrey\'s strong box or the bank at Blickley.  The rent is too important a\r\nmatter to be put to any hazard, considering that Mr Rowland is our\r\nlandlord.  It is all ready and safe."\r\n\r\n"That is well.  Now, Margaret, could you swear to this visitor of ours?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Margaret, softly, looking round, as if to convince herself\r\nthat he was not there still.  "No: his bonnet was so large, and he kept\r\nthe shadow of it so carefully upon his face, that I should not know him\r\nagain--at least, not in any other dress; and we shall never see him\r\nagain in this.  It is very disagreeable," she continued, shuddering\r\nslightly, "to think that we may pass him any day or every day, and that\r\nhe may say to himself as we go by, `There go the ladies that sat with\r\ntheir feet on the fender so comfortably when I went in, without leave!\'"\r\n\r\n"Poor wretch! he will rather say, `There goes the young lady that I made\r\nso unhappy about her ring.  I wish I had choked with the wine I drank,\r\nbefore I took that ring!\'  The first man you meet that cannot look you\r\nin the face is the thief, depend upon it, Margaret."\r\n\r\n"I must not depend upon that.  But, Maria, could you swear to him?"\r\n\r\n"I am not quite sure at this moment, but I believe I could.  The light\r\nfrom the fire shone brightly upon his black chin, and a bit of lank hair\r\nthat came from under his mob cap.  I could swear to the shawl."\r\n\r\n"So could I: but that will be burned to-morrow morning.  Now, Maria, do\r\ngo to bed."\r\n\r\n"Well, if you had rather--.  Cannot we be together?  Must I be treated\r\nas a guest, and have a room to myself?"\r\n\r\n"Not if you think we can make room in mine.  We shall be most\r\ncomfortable there, shall not we--near to Morris and Hester?"\r\n\r\nRather than separate, they both betook themselves to the bed in\r\nMargaret\'s room.  Maria lay still, as if asleep, but wide awake and\r\nlistening.  Margaret mourned her turquoise with silent tears all the\r\nrest of the night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FORTY.\r\n\r\nLIGHTSOME DAYS.\r\n\r\nBefore he returned home in the morning, Hope went to Dr Levitt\'s, to\r\nreport of what he had seen and heard on Mr Grey\'s premises in the\r\ncourse of the night.  He was persuaded that several persons had been\r\nabout the yards; and he had seen a light appearing and disappearing\r\namong the shrubs which grew thick in the rear of the house.  Sydney and\r\nhe had examined the premises this morning, in company with Mr Grey\'s\r\nclerk; and they had found the flower-beds trampled, and drops of tallow\r\nfrom a candle which had probably been taken out of a lantern, and ashes\r\nfrom tobacco-pipes, scattered under the lee of a pile of logs.  Nothing\r\nwas missed from the yards: it was probable that they were the resort of\r\npersons who had been plundering elsewhere: but the danger from fire was\r\nso great, and the unpleasantness of having such night neighbours so\r\nextreme, that the gentlemen agreed that no time must be lost in\r\nproviding a watch, which would keep the premises clear of intruders.\r\nThe dog, which had by some means been cajoled out of his duty, must be\r\nreplaced by a more faithful one; and Dr Levitt was disposed to\r\nestablish a patrol in the village.\r\n\r\nThe astonishment of both was great when Margaret appeared, early as it\r\nwas, with her story.  It was the faint hope of recovering her ring which\r\nbrought her thus early to the magistrate\'s.  Her brother was satisfied\r\nto stay and listen, when he found that Hester knew as yet nothing of the\r\nmatter.  It was a clear case that the Greys must find some other\r\nguardian for the nights that Mr Grey spent from home; and Dr Levitt\r\nsaid that no man was justified in leaving his family unprotected for a\r\nsingle night in such times as these.  He spoke with the deepest concern\r\nof the state of the neighbourhood this winter, and of his own inability\r\nto preserve security, by his influence either as clergyman or\r\nmagistrate.  The fact was, he said, that neither law nor gospel could\r\ndeter men from crime, when pressed by want, and hardened against all\r\nother claims by those of their starving families.  Such times had never\r\nbeen known within his remembrance; and the guardians of the public peace\r\nand safety were almost as much at their wits\' end as the sickly and\r\nsavage population they had to control.  He must to-day consult with as\r\nmany of his brother magistrates as he could reach, as to what could be\r\ndone for the general security and relief.\r\n\r\nAs Hope and Margaret returned home to breakfast, they agreed that their\r\nlittle household was more free to discharge the duties of such a time\r\nthan most of their neighbours of their own rank could possibly be.  They\r\nhad now little or nothing of which they could be robbed.  It was\r\ndifficult to conceive how they could be further injured.  They might\r\nnow, wholly free from fear and self-regards, devote themselves to\r\nforgive and serve their neighbours.  Such emancipation from care as is\r\nthe blessing of poverty, even more than of wealth, was theirs; and, as a\r\ngreat blessing in the midst of very tolerable evil, they felt it.\r\nMargaret laughed, as she asked Edward if he could spare a few pence to\r\nbuy horn spoons in the village, as all the silver ones were gone.\r\n\r\nHester was not at all too much alarmed or disturbed, when she missed her\r\nwatch, and heard what had happened.  She was chiefly vexed that she had\r\nslept through it all.  It seemed so ridiculous that the master of the\r\nhouse should be safe at a distance, and the mistress comfortably asleep,\r\nduring such an event, leaving it to sister, maid, and guest, to bear all\r\nthe terror of it!\r\n\r\nDr Levitt\'s absence of mind did not interfere with the activity of his\r\nheart, or with his penetration in cases where the hearts of others were\r\nconcerned.  He perceived that the lost turquoise was, from some cause,\r\ninestimable to Margaret, and he spared no pains to recover it: but weeks\r\npassed on without any tidings of it.  Margaret told herself that she\r\nmust give up this, as she had given up so much else, with as much\r\ncheerfulness as she could; but she missed her ring every hour of the\r\nday.\r\n\r\nChristmas came; and the expected contest took, place about the rent of\r\nthe corner-house.  Mr Rowland showed his lady the bank-notes on the\r\nmorning of quarter-day, and then immediately and secretly sent them\r\nback.  Mrs Rowland had never been so sorry to see bank-notes; yet she\r\nwould have been so angry at their being returned, that her husband\r\nconcealed the fact from her.  Within an hour the money was in Mr\r\nRowland\'s hands again, with a request that he would desist from pressing\r\nfavours upon those who could not but consider them as pecuniary\r\nobligation, and not as justice.  Mr Rowland sighed, turned the key of\r\nhis desk upon the money, and set forth to the corner-house, to see\r\nwhether no repairs were wanted--whether there was nothing that he could\r\ndo as landlord to promote the comfort and security of his excellent\r\ntenants.\r\n\r\nChristmas came; and Morris found she could not leave her young ladies\r\nwhile the days were so very short.  She would receive no wages after\r\nChristmas, and she would take care that she cost them next to nothing;\r\nbut she could not be easy to go till brighter days--days externally\r\nbrighter, at least--were at hand, nor till the baby was a little less\r\ntender, and had shown beyond dispute that he was likely to be a stout\r\nlittle fellow.  She could not think of Miss Margaret getting up quite in\r\nthe dark, to light the fire; it was a dismal time to begin such a new\r\nsort of work.  Margaret privately explained to her that these little\r\ncircumstances brought no discouragement to persons who undertake such\r\nlabour with sufficient motive; and Morris admitted this.  She saw the\r\ndifference between the case of a poor girl first going to service, who\r\ntrembles half the night at the idea of her mistress\'s displeasure if she\r\nshould not happen to wake in time; such poor girl undertaking service\r\nfor a maintenance, and by no means from love in either party towards the\r\nother--Morris saw the difference between the morning waking to such a\r\nservice and Margaret\'s being called from her bed by love of those whom\r\nshe was going to serve through the day, and by an exhilarating sense of\r\nhonour and duty.  Morris saw that, while to the solitary dependant every\r\naccessory of cheerfulness is necessary to make her willingly leave her\r\nrest--the early sunshine through her window, and the morning songs of\r\nbirds--it mattered little to Margaret under what circumstances she went\r\nabout her business--whether in darkness or in light, in keen frost or\r\ngenial warmth.  She had the strength of will, in whose glow all the\r\ndisgust, all the meanness, all the hardship of the most sordid\r\noccupations is consumed, leaving unimpaired the dignity and delight of\r\ntoil.  Morris saw and fully admitted all this; and yet she stayed on\r\ntill the end of January.\r\n\r\nBy that time her friends were not satisfied to have her remain any\r\nlonger.  It was necessary that she should earn money; and she had an\r\nopportunity now of earning what she needed at Birmingham.  The time was\r\ncome when Morris must go.\r\n\r\nThe family had their sorrow all to themselves that dismal evening; for\r\nnot a soul in Deerbrook, except Maria, knew that Morris was going at\r\nall.  Maria had known all along; and it had been settled that Maria\r\nshould occupy Morris\'s room, after it was vacated, as often as she felt\r\nnervous and lonely in her lodging.  But she was not aware of the precise\r\nday when the separation of these old and dear friends was to take place.\r\nSo they mourned Morris as privately as she had long grieved over their\r\nadversity.\r\n\r\nMr Hope meant to drive Morris to Buckley himself, and to see her into\r\nthe coach for Birmingham; and he had borrowed Mr Grey\'s gig for the\r\npurpose.  He had been urged by Mr Grey not to think of returning that\r\nnight, had desired his wife and sister not to expect him, and had\r\nengaged a neighbour to sleep in the house.  The sisters might well look\r\nforward to a sad evening; and their hearts were heavy when the gig came\r\nto the door, when they were fortifying Morris with a parting glass of\r\nwine, and wrapping her up with warm things which were to come back with\r\nher master, and expressing their heart-sorrow by the tenderness with\r\nwhich they melted the very soul of poor Morris.  She could not speak;\r\nshe could resist nothing.  She took all they offered her to comfort\r\nherself with, from having neither heart nor voice to refuse.  Morris\r\nnever gave way to tears; but she was as solemn as if she were going to\r\nexecution.  The baby alone was insensible to her gravity; he laughed in\r\nher face when she took him into her arms for the last time;--a\r\nseasonable laugh it was, for it relieved his mother of some slight\r\nsuperstitious dread which was stealing upon her, as she witnessed the\r\nsolemnity of Morris\'s farewell to him.  They all spoke of her return to\r\nthem; but no one felt that there was any comfort in so vague a hope,\r\namidst the sadness of the present certainty.\r\n\r\nAs Hester and Margaret stood out on the steps to watch the gig till the\r\nlast moment, a few flakes of snow were driven against their faces.  They\r\nfeared Morris would have a dreary journey; and this was not the\r\npleasantest thought to carry with them into the house.\r\n\r\nWhile Hester nursed her infant by the fire, Margaret went round the\r\nhouse, to see what there was for her to do to-night.  It moved her to\r\nfind how thoughtfully everything was done.  Busy as Morris had been with\r\na thousand little affairs and preparations, every part of the house was\r\nleft in the completest order.  The very blinds of the chambers were\r\ndrawn down, and a fire was laid in every grate, in case of its being\r\nwanted.  The tea-tray was set in the pantry, and not a plate left from\r\ndinner unwashed.  Margaret felt and said how badly she should supply the\r\nplace of Morris\'s hands, to say nothing of their loss of her head and\r\nheart.  She sighed her thankfulness to her old friend, that she was\r\nalready at liberty to sit down beside her sister, with actually nothing\r\non her hands to be done before tea-time.\r\n\r\nIt was always a holiday to Margaret when she could sit by at leisure, as\r\nthe morning and evening dressing and undressing of the baby went on.\r\nHester would never entrust the business to her or to any one: but it was\r\nthe next best thing to watch the pranks of the little fellow, and the\r\nplay between him and his mother; and then to see the fun subside into\r\ndrowsiness, and be lost in that exquisite spectacle, the quiet sleep of\r\nan infant.  When he was this evening laid in his basket, and all was\r\nunusually still, from there being no one but themselves in the house,\r\nand the snow having by this time fallen thickly outside, Margaret said\r\nto her sister--"If I remember rightly, it is just a twelvemonth since\r\nyou warned me how wretched marriage was.  Just a year, is it not?"\r\n\r\n"Is it possible?" said Hester, withdrawing her eyes from her infant.\r\n\r\n"I wish I could have foreseen then how soon I might remind you of this."\r\n\r\n"Is it possible that I said so?--and of all marriage?"\r\n\r\n"Of all love, and all marriage.  I remember it distinctly."\r\n\r\n"You have but too much reason to remember it, love.  But how thankless,\r\nhow wicked of me ever to say so."\r\n\r\n"We all, perhaps, say some wretched things which dwell on other people\'s\r\nminds, long after we have forgotten them ourselves.  It is one of the\r\nacts we shall waken up to as sins--perhaps every one of us--whenever we\r\nbecome qualified to review our lives dispassionately;--as sins, no\r\ndoubt, for the pain does not die with the utterance; and to give pain\r\nneedlessly, and to give lasting pain, is surely a sin.  We are none of\r\nus guiltless; but I am glad you said this particular thing--dreadful as\r\nit was to hear it.  It has caused me a great deal of thought within the\r\nyear; and it now makes us both aware how much happier we are than we\r\nwere then."\r\n\r\n"We!"\r\n\r\n"Yes; all of us.  I rather shrink from measuring states of fortune and\r\nof mind, as they are at one time against those of another; but it is\r\nimpossible to recall that warning of yours, and be unaware how\r\ndifferently we have cause to think and speak now.  I felt at the time\r\nthat it was too late for us to complain of love and of marriage.  The\r\ndie was then cast for us all.  It is much better to feel now that those\r\ncomplaints were the expression of passing pain, long since over."\r\n\r\n"I rejoice to hear you say this for yourself, Margaret; though I own I\r\nshould scarcely have expected it.  And yet no one is more aware than I\r\nthat it is a blessing to love--a blessing still, whatever may be the woe\r\nthat must come with the love.  It is a blessing to live for another, to\r\nfeel far more deeply than the most selfish being on earth ever felt for\r\nhimself.  I know that it is better to have felt this disinterested\r\nattachment to another, even in the midst of storms of passion hidden in\r\nthe heart, and of pangs from disappointment, than to live on in the very\r\nbest peace of those who have never loved.  Yet, knowing this, I have\r\nbeen cowardly for you, Margaret, and at one time sank under my own\r\ntroubles.  Any one who loved as I did should have been braver.  I should\r\nhave been more willing, both for you and for myself, to meet the\r\nsuffering which belongs to the exercise of all the highest and best part\r\nof our nature: but I was unworthy then of the benignant discipline\r\nappointed to me: and at the moment, I doubt not I should have preferred,\r\nif the choice had been offered to me, the safety and quiet of a\r\npassionless existence to the glorious exercise which has been graciously\r\nappointed me against my will.  I do try now, Margaret, to be thankful\r\nthat you have had some of this exercise and discipline; but I have not\r\nfaith enough.  My thanks are all up in grief before I have done--grief\r\nthat you have the struggle and the sorrow, without the support and the\r\nfull return which have been granted to me."\r\n\r\n"You need not grieve much for me.  I have not only had the full return\r\nyou speak of, but I have it still.  It cannot be spoken, or written, or\r\neven indulged; but I know it exists; and therefore am I happier than I\r\nwas last year.  How foolish it is," she continued, as if thinking aloud,\r\n"how perfectly childish to set our hearts on what we call happiness,--on\r\nany arrangement of circumstances, either in our minds or our fortunes--\r\nso little as we know!  How you and I should have dreaded this night and\r\nto-morrow, if they could have been foreshown to us a while ago!  How we\r\nshould have shrunk from sitting down under the cloud of sorrow which\r\nappears to have settled upon this house!  And now this evening has\r\ncome--"\r\n\r\n"The evening of Morris\'s going away, and everything else so dreary!  No\r\nservant, no money, no prospect!  Careful economy at home, ill-will\r\nabroad; the times bad, the future all blank--we two sitting here alone,\r\nwith the snow falling without!"\r\n\r\n"And our hearts aching with parting with Morris (we must come back to\r\nthat principal grief).  How dismal all this would have looked, if we\r\ncould have seen it in a fairy-glass at Birmingham long ago!--and yet I\r\nwould not change this very evening for any we ever spent in Birmingham,\r\nwhen we were exceedingly proud of being very happy."\r\n\r\n"Nor I.  This is life: and to live--to live with the whole soul, and\r\nmind, and strength, is enough.  It is not often that I have strength to\r\nfeel this, and courage to say it; but to-night I have both."\r\n\r\n"And in time we may be strong enough to pray that this child may truly\r\nand wholly live--may live in every capacity of his being, whatever\r\nsuffering may be the condition of such life: but it requires some\r\ncourage to pray so for him, he looks so unfit for anything but ease at\r\npresent!"\r\n\r\n"For anything but feeding and sleeping, and laughing in our faces.  Did\r\nyou ever see an infant sleep so softly?  Are not those wheels passing?\r\nYes; surely I heard wheels rolling over the snow."\r\n\r\nShe was right.  In five minutes more, Margaret had to open the door to\r\nher brother.\r\n\r\nHope had arrived at Blickley only just in time to drive Morris up to the\r\ndoor of the Birmingham coach, and put her in as the guard was blowing\r\nhis horn.  Mr Grey\'s horse had gone badly, and they had been full late\r\nin setting off.  He had not liked the prospect of staying where he was\r\ntill morning, and had resolved to bid defiance to footpads, and return:\r\nso he stepped into the coffee-room, and read the papers while the horse\r\nwas feeding, and came home as quickly after as he could.  As he was\r\nsafe, all the three were glad he had done so; and the more that, for\r\nonce, Edward seemed sad.  They made a bright fire, and gave him tea; but\r\ntheir household offices did not seem to cheer him as usual.  Hester\r\nasked, at length, whether he had heard any bad news.\r\n\r\n"Only public news.  The papers are full of everything that is dismal.\r\nThe epidemic is spreading frightfully.  It is a most serious affair.\r\nThe people you meet in the streets at Blickley look as if they had the\r\nplague raging in the town.  They say the funerals have never ceased\r\npassing through the streets, all this week; and really the churchyard I\r\nsaw seemed full of new graves.  I believe the case is little better in\r\nany town in the kingdom."\r\n\r\n"And in the villages?"\r\n\r\n"The villages follow, of course, with differences according to their\r\ncircumstances.  None will be worse than this place, when once the fever\r\nappears among us.  I would not say so anywhere but by our own fireside,\r\nbecause everything should be done to encourage the people instead of\r\nfrightening them; but indeed it is difficult to imagine a place better\r\nprepared for destruction than our pretty village is just now, from the\r\nextreme poverty of most of the people, and their ignorance, which\r\nrenders them unfit to take any rational care of themselves."\r\n\r\n"You say, `whenever the fever comes.\'  Do you think it must certainly\r\ncome?"\r\n\r\n"Yes: and I have had some suspicions, within a day or two, that it is\r\nhere already.  I must see Walcot to-morrow; and learn what he has\r\ndiscovered in his practice."\r\n\r\n"Mr Walcot!  Will not Dr Levitt do as well?"\r\n\r\n"I must see Dr Levitt too, to consult about some means of cleansing and\r\ndrying the worst of the houses in the village.  But it is quite\r\nnecessary that I should have some conversation with Walcot about the\r\nmethods of treatment of this dreadful disease.  If he is not glad of an\r\nopportunity of consulting with a brother in the profession, he ought to\r\nbe--and I have no doubt he will be; for he will very soon have as much\r\nupon him as any head and hands in the world could manage."\r\n\r\n"Cannot you let him come to you for advice and assistance when he wants\r\nit?"\r\n\r\n"I must not wait for that.  He is young, and, as we all imagine, not\r\nover wise: and a dozen of our poor neighbours might die before he became\r\naware of as much as I know to-night about this epidemic.  No, love; my\r\ndignity must give way to the safety of our neighbours.  Depend upon it,\r\nWalcot will be glad enough to hear what I have to say--if not to-morrow,\r\nby next week at furthest."\r\n\r\n"So soon?  What makes you say next week?"\r\n\r\n"I judge partly from the rate of progress of the fever elsewhere, and\r\npartly from the present state of health in Deerbrook.  There are other\r\nreasons too.  I have seen some birds of ill omen on the wing hitherward\r\nthis evening."\r\n\r\n"What can you mean?"\r\n\r\n"I mean fortune-tellers.  Are you not aware that in seasons of plague--\r\nof the epidemics of our times, as well as the plagues of former days--\r\nconjurors, and fortune-tellers, and quacks appear, as a sort of heralds\r\nof the disease?  They are not really so, for the disease in fact\r\nprecedes them; but they show themselves so immediately on its arrival,\r\nand usually before its presence is acknowledged, that they have often\r\nbeen thought to bring it.  They have early information of its existence\r\nin any place; and they come to take advantage of the first panic of the\r\ninhabitants, where there are enough who are ignorant to make the\r\nspeculation a good one.  I saw two parties of these people trooping\r\nhither; and we shall have heard something of their prophecies, and of a\r\nfever case or two, before this time to-morrow, I have little doubt."\r\n\r\n"It is this prospect which has made you sad," said Hester.\r\n\r\n"No, my dear--not that alone.  But do not let us talk about being sad.\r\nWhat does it matter?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; do let us talk about it," said Margaret, "if, as I suspect, you\r\nare sad for us.  It is about Morris\'s going away, is it not?"\r\n\r\n"About many things.  It is impossible to be at all times unaffected by\r\nsuch changes as have come upon us; I cannot always forget what my\r\nprofession once was to me, for honour, for occupation, and for income.\r\nI confidently reckoned on bringing you both to a home full of comfort.\r\nNever were women so cherished as I meant that you should be.  And now it\r\nhas ended in your little incomes being almost our only resource, and in\r\nyour being deprived of your old friend Morris, some years before her\r\ntime.  I can hardly endure to think of to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"And do you really call this the end?" asked Margaret.  "Do you consider\r\nour destiny fixed for evermore?"\r\n\r\n"As far as you and I are concerned, love," said Hester to him, "I could\r\nalmost wish that this were the end.  I feel as if almost any change\r\nwould be for the worse; I mean supposing you not to look as you do now,\r\nbut as you have always been till now.  Oh, Edward, I am so happy!"\r\n\r\nHer husband could not speak for astonishment and delight.  "You remember\r\nthat evening in Verdon woods, Edward--the evening before we were\r\nmarried?"\r\n\r\n"Remember it!"\r\n\r\n"Well.  How infinitely happier are we now than then!  Oh! that fear--\r\nthat mistrust of myself!  You reproved me for my fear and mistrust then;\r\nand I must beg leave to remind you of what you then said.  It is not\r\noften that I can have the honour of preaching to you, my dear husband,\r\nas it is rather difficult to find an occasion; but now I have caught you\r\ntripping.  What is there for you to be uneasy about now, that can at all\r\nbe compared with what I troubled myself about then?--Since that time I\r\nhave caused you much misery, I know--misery which I partly foresaw I\r\nshould cause you: but that is over, I trust.  It is over at least for\r\nthe time that we are poor and persecuted.  I dare not and do not wish\r\nfor anything otherwise than as we have it flow.  Persecution seems to\r\nhave made us wiser, and poverty happier; and how, if only Margaret were\r\naltogether as we would see her, how could we be better than we are?"\r\n\r\n"You are right, my dear wife."  These few tender words, and her\r\nhusband\'s brightened looks, sufficed--Hester had no cares.  She forgot\r\neven the fever, in seeing Edward look as gay as usual again, and in\r\nfeeling that she was everything to that feeling, that conviction, for\r\nwhich she had sighed in vain, for long after her marriage.  She had then\r\nfancied that his profession, his family, his own thoughts, were as\r\nimportant to him as herself.  She now knew that she was supreme; and\r\nthis was supreme satisfaction.\r\n\r\nWhen Margaret sprang up to her new labours in the chill dusk of the next\r\nmorning, she flattered herself that she was the first awake; but it was\r\nnot so.  When she went down, she found her brother busy shovelling the\r\nsnow away, and making a clear path from the kitchen door to the\r\ncoal-house.  He declared it delightfully warm work, by the time he had\r\nbrought in coals enough for the day, and wanted more employment of the\r\nsame sort.  He went round to the front of the house, and cleared the\r\nsteps and pavement there; caring nothing for the fact, that two or three\r\nneighbours gazed from their doors, and that some children stood blowing\r\nupon their fingers, and stamping with their feet, enduring the cold, for\r\nthe sake of seeing the gentleman clearing his own steps.\r\n\r\n"What would the Greys say?" asked Margaret, laughing; as, duster in\r\nhand, she looked from the open window, and spoke to her brother outside.\r\n\r\n"I am sure they ought to say I have done my work well."\r\n\r\n"That is just what Hester is observing within here.  You are almost\r\nready for breakfast, are you not?  She is setting the table."\r\n\r\n"Quite ready.  What warm work this is!  Really I do not believe there is\r\nsuch a bit of pavement in all Deerbrook as this of ours."\r\n\r\n"Come--come in to breakfast.  You have admired your work quite enough\r\nfor this morning."\r\n\r\nThe three who sat down to breakfast were as reasonable and philosophical\r\nas most people; but even they were taken by surprise with the sweetness\r\nof comforts provided by their own immediate toil.  There was something\r\nin the novelty, perhaps; but Hope threw on the fire with remarkable\r\nenergy the coals he had himself brought in from the coal-house, and ate\r\nwith great relish the toast toasted by his wife\'s own hands.  Margaret,\r\ntoo, looked round the room more than once, with a new sort of pride in\r\nthere being not a particle of dust on table, chair, or book.  It was\r\nscarcely possible to persuade Edward that there was nothing more for him\r\nto do about the house till the next morning; that the errand-boy would\r\ncome in an hour, and clean the shoes; and that the only assistance the\r\nmaster of the house could render, would be to take charge of the baby\r\nfor a quarter of an hour, while Hester helped her sister to make the\r\nbeds.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast, when Hester was dressing her infant, and Margaret\r\nwashing up the tea-cups and saucers, the postman\'s knock was heard.\r\nMargaret went to the door, and paid for the letter from the "emergency\r\npurse," as they called the little sum of money they had put aside for\r\nunforeseen expenses.  The letter was for Edward, and so brief that it\r\nmust be on business.\r\n\r\nIt was on business.  It was from the lawyer of Mr Hope\'s aged\r\ngrandfather; and it told that the old gentleman had at last sunk rather\r\nsuddenly under his many infirmities.  Mr Hope was invited to go--not to\r\nthe funeral, for it must be over before he could arrive, but to see the\r\nwill, in which he had a large beneficial interest, the property being\r\ndivided between himself and his brother, subject to legacies of one\r\nhundred pounds to each of his sisters, and a few smaller bequests to the\r\nservants.\r\n\r\n"This is as you always feared," said Hester to her husband, observing\r\nthe expression of concern in his face, on reading the letter.\r\n\r\n"Indeed, I always feared it would be so," he replied.  "I did what I\r\ncould to prevent this act of posthumous injustice; and I am grieved that\r\nI failed; for nothing can repair it.  My sisters will have their money--\r\nthe same in amount, but how different in value!  They will receive it as\r\na gift from their brothers, instead of as their due from their\r\ngrandfather.  I am very sorry his last act was of this character."\r\n\r\n"Will you go?  Must you go?"\r\n\r\n"No, I shall not go--at least, not at present.  The funeral would be\r\nover, you see, before I could get there; and I doubt not the rest of the\r\nbusiness may be managed quietly and easily by letter.  I have no\r\ninclination to travel just now, and no money to do it with, and strong\r\nreasons of another kind for staying at home.  No, I shall not go."\r\n\r\n"I am very glad.  Now, the first duty is to write to Emily and Anne, I\r\nsuppose: and to Frank?"\r\n\r\n"Not to Frank just yet.  He knows what I meant to do, in case of my\r\ngrandfather recurring to this disposition of his property; and, further\r\nthan this, I must not influence Frank.  He must be left entirely free to\r\ndo as he thinks proper, and I shall not communicate with him till he has\r\nhad ample time to decide on his course.  I shall write to Emily and Anne\r\nto-day."\r\n\r\n"I am sorry for them."\r\n\r\n"So am I.  What a pity it is, when the aged, whom one would wish to\r\nhonour after they are gone to their graves, impair one\'s respect, by an\r\nunjust arrangement of their affairs!  How easily might my grandfather\r\nhave satisfied us all, and secured our due reverence at the last, by\r\nmerely being just!  Now, after admitting what was just, he has gone back\r\ninto his prejudices, and placed us all in a painful position, from which\r\nit will be difficult to every one of us to regard his memory as we\r\nshould wish."\r\n\r\n"He little thought you would look upon his rich legacy in this way,"\r\nsaid Margaret, smiling.\r\n\r\n"I gave him warning that I should.  It was impossible to refuse it more\r\nperemptorily than I did."\r\n\r\n"That must be your satisfaction now, love.  You have done everything\r\nthat was right; so we will not discompose ourselves because another has\r\ndone a wrong which you can partly repair."\r\n\r\n"My dear wife, what comfort you give!  What a blessing it is, that you\r\nthink, and feel, and will act, with me--making my duty easy instead of\r\ndifficult!"\r\n\r\n"I was going to ask," observed Margaret, "whether you have no\r\nmisgiving--no doubt whatever that you are right in refusing all this\r\nmoney."\r\n\r\n"Not the slightest doubt, Margaret.  The case is not in any degree\r\naltered by my change of fortune.  The facts remain, that my sisters have\r\nreceived nothing yet from the property, while I have had my professional\r\neducation out of it.  That my profession does not at present supply us\r\nwith bread does not affect the question at all: nor can you think that\r\nit does, I am sure.  But Hester, my love, what think you of our prospect\r\nof a hundred pounds?"\r\n\r\n"A hundred pounds!"\r\n\r\n"Yes; that is the sum set down for me when the honest will was made; and\r\nthat sum I shall of course retain."\r\n\r\n"Oh, delightful!  What a quantity of comfort we may get out of a hundred\r\npounds!  How rich we shall be!"\r\n\r\n"She is thinking already," said Margaret, "what sort of a pretty cloak\r\nbaby is to have for the summer."\r\n\r\n"And Margaret must have something out of it, must not she, love?" asked\r\nHester.\r\n\r\n"We will all enjoy it, with many thanks to my poor grandfather.  Surely\r\nthis hundred pounds will set us on through the year."\r\n\r\n"That will be very pleasant, really," observed Margaret.  "To be sure of\r\nbread for all the rest of the year!  Oh, the value of a hundred pounds\r\nto some people!"\r\n\r\n"What a pity that Morris did not stay this one other day!" exclaimed\r\nHester.  "And yet, perhaps, not so.  It might have perplexed her mind\r\nabout leaving us, and induced her to give up her new place; and there is\r\nnothing in a chance hundred pounds to justify that.  It is better as it\r\nis."\r\n\r\n"All things are very well as they are," said Hope, "as long as we think\r\nso.  Now, I am going to call on Walcot.  Good-bye."\r\n\r\n"Stop, stop one moment!  Stay, and see what I have found!" cried his\r\nwife, in a tone of glee.  "Look!  Feel!  Tell me--is not this our boy\'s\r\nfirst tooth?"\r\n\r\n"It is--it certainly is.  I give you joy, my little fellow!"\r\n\r\n"Worth all the hundreds of pounds in the world," observed Margaret,\r\ncoming in her turn to see and feel the little pearly edge, whose value\r\nits owner was far from appreciating, while worried with the inquisition\r\nwhich was made into the mysteries of his mouth.  "Now it _is_ a pity\r\nthat Morris is not here!" all exclaimed.\r\n\r\n"We must write to her.  Perhaps we might have found it yesterday, if we\r\nhad had any idea it would come so soon."\r\n\r\nNo: Hester was quite positive there was no tooth to be seen or felt last\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n"Well, we must write to Morris."\r\n\r\n"You must leave me a corner," said Hope.  "We must all try our skill in\r\ndescribing a first tooth.  I will consider my part as I walk.  Bite my\r\nfinger once more before I go, my boy."\r\n\r\nThe sisters busied themselves in putting the parlour in order, for the\r\nreception of any visitors who might chance to call, though the streets\r\nwere so deep in snow as to render the chance a remote one.  Margaret\r\nbelieved that, when the time should come, she might set the potatoes\r\nover the parlour fire to boil, and thus, without detection, save the\r\nlighting another fire.  But before she had taken off her apron, while\r\nshe was in the act of sweeping up the hearth, there was a loud knock,\r\nwhich she recognised as proceeding from the hand of a Grey.  The family\r\nresemblance extended to their knocks at the door.\r\n\r\nAs if no snow had fallen, Mrs Grey and Sophia entered.\r\n\r\n"You are surprised to see us, my dears, I have no doubt.  But I could\r\nnot be satisfied without knowing what Mr Hope thinks of this epidemic,\r\nthis terrible fever, which every one is speaking about so frightfully."\r\n\r\n"Why, what can he think?"\r\n\r\n"I mean, my dear, does he suppose that it will come here?  Are we likely\r\nto have it?"\r\n\r\n"He tells us, what I suppose you hear from Mr Grey, that the fever\r\nseems to be spreading everywhere, and is just now very destructive at\r\nBuckley.  Does not Mr Grey tell you so?"\r\n\r\n"No, indeed; there is no learning anything from Mr Grey that he does\r\nnot like to tell.  Sophia, I think we must take in a newspaper again,\r\nthat we may stand a chance of knowing something."\r\n\r\nSophia agreed.\r\n\r\n"Sophia and I found that we really had no time to read the newspaper.\r\nThere it lay, and nobody touched it; for Mr Grey reads the news in the\r\noffice always.  I told Mr Grey it was just paying so much a-week for no\r\ngood to anybody, and I begged he would countermand the paper.  But we\r\nmust take it in again, really, to know how this fever goes on.  Does Mr\r\nHope think, my dears, as many people are saying here this morning, that\r\nit is a sort of plague?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, mamma," exclaimed Sophia, "how can you say anything so dreadful?"\r\n\r\n"I have not heard my husband speak of it so," said Hester.  "He thinks\r\nit a very serious affair, happening as it does in the midst of a\r\nscarcity, when the poor are already depressed and sickly."\r\n\r\n"Ah! that is always the way, Mr Grey tells me.  After a scarcity comes\r\nthe fever, he says.  The poor are much to be pitied indeed.  But what\r\nshould those do who are not poor, have you heard Mr Hope say?"\r\n\r\n"He thinks they should help their poor neighbours to the very utmost."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes; of course: but what I mean is, what precautions would be\r\nadvise?"\r\n\r\n"We will ask him.  I have not heard him speak particularly of this on\r\nthe present occasion."\r\n\r\n"Then he has not established any regulations in his own family?"\r\n\r\n"No.  But I know his opinion on such cases in general to be, that the\r\nsafest way is to go on as usual, taking rational care of health, and\r\navoiding all unnecessary terror.  This common way of living, and a\r\nparticularly diligent care of those who want the good offices of the\r\nrich, are what he would recommend, I believe, at this time: but when he\r\ncomes in, we will ask him.  You had better stay till he returns.  He may\r\nbring some news.  Meantime, I am sorry my baby is asleep.  I should like\r\nto show you his first tooth."\r\n\r\n"His first tooth?  Indeed!  He is a forward little fellow.  But, Hester,\r\ndo you happen to have heard your husband say what sort of fumigation he\r\nwould recommend in case of such a fever as this showing itself in the\r\nhouse?"\r\n\r\n"Indeed I have not heard him speak of fumigations at all.  Have you,\r\nMargaret?"\r\n\r\n"I should just like to know; for Mrs Jones told me of a very good one;\r\nand Mrs Howell thinks ill of it.  Mrs Jones recommended me to pour\r\nsome sulphuric acid upon salt--common salt--in a saucer; but Mrs Howell\r\nsays there is nothing half so good as hot vinegar."\r\n\r\n"Somebody has come and put up a stall," said Sophia, "where he sells\r\nfumigating powders, and some pills, which he says are an infallible\r\nremedy against the fever."\r\n\r\n"Preventive, my dear."\r\n\r\n"Well, mamma, \'tis just the same thing.  Does Mr Hope know anything of\r\nthe people who have set up that stall?"\r\n\r\nHester thought she might venture to answer that question without waiting\r\nfor her husband\'s return.  She laughed as she said, that medical men\r\navoided acquaintance with quacks.\r\n\r\n"Does Mr Hope think that medical men are in any particular danger?"\r\nasked Sophia, bashfully, but with great anxiety.  "I think they must be,\r\ngoing among so many people who are ill.  If there is a whole family in\r\nthe fever in a cottage at Crossly End, as Mrs Howell says there is, how\r\nvery dangerous it must be to attend them!"\r\n\r\nSophia was checked by a wink from her mother, and then first remembered\r\nthat she was speaking to a surgeon\'s wife.  She tried to explain away\r\nwhat she had said; but there was no need.  Hester calmly remarked that\r\nit was the duty of many to expose themselves at such times in an equal\r\ndegree with the medical men; and that she believed that few were more\r\nsecure than those who did so without selfish thoughts and ignorant\r\npanic.  Sophia believed that every one did not think so.  Some of Mr\r\nWalcot\'s friends had been remonstrating with him about going so much\r\namong the poor sick people, just at this time; and Mr Walcot had been\r\nconsulting her as to whether his duty to his parents did not require\r\nthat he should have some regard to his own safety.  He had not known\r\nwhat to do about going to a house in Turnstile-lane, where some people\r\nwere ill.\r\n\r\nA dead silence followed this explanation.  Mrs Grey broke it by asking\r\nMargaret if she might speak plainly to her--the common preface to a\r\nlecture.  As usual, Margaret replied, "Oh! certainly."\r\n\r\n"I would only just hint, my dear, that it would be as well if you did\r\nnot open the door yourself.  You cannot think how strangely it looks:\r\nand some very unpleasant remarks might be made upon it.  It is of no\r\nconsequence such a thing happening when Sophia and I come to your door.\r\nI would not have you think we regard it for ourselves in the least--the\r\nnot being properly shown in by a servant."\r\n\r\n"Oh! not in the least," protested Sophia.\r\n\r\n"But you know it might have been the Levitts.  I suppose it would have\r\nbeen just the same if the Levitts had called?"\r\n\r\n"It certainly would."\r\n\r\n"It might have been the Levitts certainly," observed Hester: "but I must\r\njust explain that it was to oblige me that Margaret went to the door."\r\n\r\n"Then, my dear, I hope you will point out some other way in which\r\nMargaret may oblige you; for really you have no idea how oddly it looks\r\nfor young ladies to answer knocks at the door.  It is not proper\r\nself-respect, proper regard to appearance.  And was it to oblige you\r\nthat Margaret carried a basket all through Deerbrook on Wednesday, with\r\nthe small end of a carrot peeping out from under the lid?  Fie, my\r\ndears!  I must say fie!  It grieves me to find fault with you: but\r\nreally this is folly.  It is really neglecting appearances too far."\r\n\r\nMr Hope did not return in time to see Mrs Grey.  When she could wait\r\nno longer, Hester promised to send her husband to solve Mrs Grey\'s\r\ndifficulties.\r\n\r\n"What would she have said," exclaimed Hester, "if she had seen my\r\nhusband\'s doings of this morning?"\r\n\r\n"Ah! what indeed?"\r\n\r\n"Actually shovelling snow from his own steps!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I thought you meant giving away a competence.  Which act would she\r\nhave thought the least self-respectful?"\r\n\r\n"She would have had a great deal to say on his duty to his family in\r\nboth cases.  But it is all out of kindness that she grieves so much over\r\nhis `enthusiasm,\' and lectures us for our disregard of appearances.  If\r\nshe loved us less, we should hear less of her concern, and it would be\r\ntold to others behind our backs.  So we will not mind it.  You do not\r\nmind it, Margaret?"\r\n\r\n"I rather enjoy it."\r\n\r\n"That is right.  Now I wish my husband would come in.  He has been gone\r\nvery long; and I want to hear the whole truth about this fever."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FORTY ONE.\r\n\r\nDEERBROOK IN SHADOW.\r\n\r\nIt was some hours before Hope appeared at home again; and when he did,\r\nhe was very grave.  Mr Walcot had been truly glad to see him, and, it\r\nwas plain, would have applied to him for aid and co-operation some days\r\nbefore, if Mrs Rowland had not interfered, to prevent any consultation\r\nof the kind.  The state of health of Deerbrook was bad,--much worse than\r\nHope had had any suspicion of.  Whole families were prostrated by the\r\nfever in the labourers\' cottages, and it was creeping into the better\r\nsort of houses.  Mr Walcot had requested Hope to visit some of his\r\npatients with him: and what he had seen had convinced him that the\r\ndisease was of a most formidable character, and that a great mortality\r\nmust be expected in Deerbrook.  Walcot appeared to be doing his duty\r\nwith more energy than might have been expected: and it seemed as if\r\nwhatever talent he had, was exercised in his profession.  Hope\'s opinion\r\nof him was raised by what he had seen this morning.  Walcot had\r\ncomplained that his skill and knowledge could have no fair play among a\r\nset of people so ignorant as the families of his Deerbrook patients.\r\nThey put more faith in charms than in medicines or care; and were\r\nrunning out in the cold and damp to have their fortunes told by night,\r\nor in the grey of the morning.  If a fortune-teller promised long life,\r\nall the warnings of the doctor went for nothing.  Then, again, the\r\npeople mistook the oppression which was one of the first symptoms of the\r\nfever, for debility; and before the doctor was sent for, or in defiance\r\nof his directions, the patient was plied with strong drinks, and his\r\ncase rendered desperate from the beginning.  Mr Walcot had complained\r\nthat the odds were really too much against him, and that he believed\r\nhimself likely to lose almost every fever patient he had.  It may be\r\nimagined how welcome to him were Mr Hope\'s countenance, suggestions,\r\nand influence,--such as the prejudices of the people had left it.\r\n\r\nDr Levitt\'s influence was of little more avail than Mr Hope\'s.  From\r\nthis day, he was as busily engaged among the sick as the medical\r\ngentlemen themselves; laying aside his books, and spending all his time\r\namong his parishioners; not neglecting the rich, but especially devoting\r\nhimself to the poor.  He co-operated with Hope in every way; raising\r\nmoney to cleanse, air, and dry the most cheerless of the cottages, and\r\nto supply the indigent sick with warmth and food.  But all appeared to\r\nbe of little avail.  The disease stole on through the village, as if it\r\nhad been left to work its own way; from day to day tidings came abroad\r\nof another and another who was down in the fever,--the Tuckers\'\r\nmaidservant, Mr Hill\'s shop-boy, poor Mrs Paxton, always sure to be\r\nill when anybody else was, and all John Ringworth\'s five children.  In a\r\nfortnight, the church bell began to give token how fatal the sickness\r\nwas becoming.  It tolled till those who lived very near the church were\r\nweary of hearing it.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of a day when its sound had scarcely ceased since\r\nsunrise, Dr Levitt and Hope met at the door of the corner-house.\r\n\r\n"You are the man I wanted to meet," said Dr Levitt.  "I have been\r\ninquiring for you, but your household could give me no account of you.\r\nCould you just step home with me?  Or come to me in the evening, will\r\nyou?  But stay!  There is no time like the present, after all; so, if\r\nyou will allow me, I will walk in with you now; and, if you are going to\r\ndinner, I will make one.  I have nobody to sit down with me at home at\r\npresent, you know,--or perhaps you do not know."\r\n\r\n"Indeed I was not aware of the absence of your family," said Hope,\r\nleading the way into the parlour, where Margaret at the moment was\r\nlaying the cloth.\r\n\r\n"You must have wondered that you had seen nothing of my wife all this\r\nweek, if you did not know where she was.  I thought it best, all things\r\nconsidered, to send them every one away.  I hope we have done right.  I\r\nfind I am more free for the discharge of my own duty, now that I am\r\nunchecked by their fears for me, and untroubled by my own anxiety for\r\nthem.  I have sent them all abroad, and shall go for them when this\r\nepidemic has run its course; and not till then.  I little thought what\r\nsatisfaction I could feel in walking about my own house, to see how\r\ndeserted it looks.  I never hear that bell but I rejoice that all that\r\nbelong to me are so far off."\r\n\r\n"I wanted to ask you about that bell," said Hope.  "My question may seem\r\nto you to savour strongly of dissent; but I must inquire whether it is\r\nabsolutely necessary for bad news to be announced to all Deerbrook every\r\nday, and almost all day long.  However far we may be from objecting to\r\nhear it in ordinary times, should not our first consideration now be for\r\nthe living?  Is not the case altered by the number of deaths that takes\r\nplace at a season like this?"\r\n\r\n"I am quite of your opinion, Mr Hope; and I have talked with Owen, and\r\nmany others, about that matter, within this week.  I have proposed to\r\ndispense, for the present, with a custom which I own myself to be\r\nattached to in ordinary times, but which I now see may be pernicious.\r\nBut it cannot be done.  We must yield the point."\r\n\r\n"I will not engage to cure any sick, or to keep any well, who live\r\nwithin sound of that bell."\r\n\r\n"I am not surprised to hear you say so.  But this practice has so become\r\na part of people\'s religion, that it seems as if worse effects would\r\nfollow from discontinuing it than from pursuing the usual course.  Owen\r\nsays there is scarcely a person in Deerbrook who would not talk of a\r\nheathen death and burial if the bell were silenced; and, if once the\r\npeople\'s repose in their religion is shaken, I really know not what will\r\nbecome of them."\r\n\r\n"I agree with you there.  Their religious feelings must be left\r\nuntouched, or all is over; but I am sorry that this particular\r\nobservance is implicated with them so completely as you say.  It will be\r\nwell if it does not soon become an impossibility to toll the bell for\r\nall who die."\r\n\r\n"It would be well, too," said Dr Levitt, "if this were the only\r\nsuperstition the people entertained.  They are more terrified with some\r\nothers than with this bell.  I am afraid they are more depressed by\r\ntheir superstitions than sustained by their religion.  Have you\r\nobserved, Hope, how many of them stand looking at the sky every night?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; and we hear, wherever we go, of fiery swords, and dreadful angels,\r\nseen in the clouds; and the old prophecies have all come up again--at\r\nleast, all of them that are dismal.  As for the death-watches, they are\r\nout of number; and there is never a fire lighted but a coffin flies\r\nout."\r\n\r\n"And this story of a ghost of a coffin, with four ghosts to bear it,\r\nthat goes up and down in the village all night long," said Hester, "I\r\nreally do not wonder that it shakes the nerves of the sick to hear of\r\nit.  They say that no one can stop those bearers, or get any answer from\r\nthem: but on they glide, let what will be in their way."\r\n\r\n"Come, tell me," said Dr Levitt, "have not you yourself looked out for\r\nthat sight?"\r\n\r\nHester acknowledged that she had seen a real substantial coffin, carried\r\nby human bearers, pass down the middle of the street, at an hour past\r\nmidnight; the removal of a body from a house where it had died, she\r\nsupposed, to another whence it was to be buried.  This coffin and the\r\nghostly one she took to be one and the same.\r\n\r\nDr Levitt mentioned instances of superstition, which could scarcely\r\nhave been believed by him, if related by another.\r\n\r\n"Do you know the Platts?" he inquired of Hope.  "Have you seen the poor\r\nwoman that lies ill there with her child?"\r\n\r\n"Yes: what a state of destitution they are in!"\r\n\r\n"At the very time that that woman and her child are lying on shavings,\r\nbegged from the carpenter\'s yard, her mother finds means to fee the\r\nfortune-teller in the lane for reading a dream.  The fortune-teller\r\ndooms the child, and speaks doubtfully of the mother."\r\n\r\n"I could not conceive the reason why no one of the family would do\r\nanything for the boy.  I used what authority I could, while I was there;\r\nbut I fear he has been left to his fate since.  The neighbours will not\r\nenter the house."\r\n\r\n"What neighbours?" said Margaret.  "You have never so much as asked me."\r\n\r\n"You are our main stay at home, Margaret.  I could ask no more of you\r\nthan you do here."\r\n\r\nMargaret was now putting the dinner on the table.  It consisted of a\r\nbowl of potatoes, salt, the loaf and butter, and a pitcher of water.\r\nDr Levitt said grace, and they sat down, without one word of apology\r\nfrom host or hostess.  Though Dr Levitt had not been prepared for an\r\nevidence like this of the state of affairs in the family, he had known\r\nenough of their adversity to understand the case now at a glance.  No\r\none ate more heartily than he; and the conversation went on as if a\r\nsumptuous feast had been spread before the party.\r\n\r\n"I own myself disappointed," said Hope, "in finding among our neighbours\r\nso little disposition to help each other.  I hardly understand it,\r\ntrusting as I have ever done in the generosity of the poor, and having\r\nalways before seen my faith justified.  The apathy of some, and the\r\nselfish terrors of others, are worse to witness than the disease\r\nitself."\r\n\r\n"How can you wonder," said Dr Levitt, "when they have such an example\r\nbefore their eyes in certain of their neighbours, to whom they are\r\naccustomed to look up?  Sir William Hunter and his lady are enough to\r\nparalyse the morals of the whole parish at a time like this.  Do not you\r\nknow the plan they go upon?  They keep their outer gates locked, lest\r\nany one from the village should set foot within their grounds; every\r\narticle left at the lodge for the use of the family is fumigated before\r\nit is admitted into the house: and it is generally understood that\r\nneither the gentleman nor the lady will leave the estate, in any\r\nemergency whatever, till the disease has entirely passed away.  Our poor\r\nare not to have the solace of their presence even in church, during this\r\ntime of peril, when the face of the prosperous is like light in a dark\r\nplace.  Sir William makes it no secret that they would have left home\r\naltogether, if they could have hoped to be safer anywhere else--if they\r\ncould have gone anywhere without danger of meeting the fever."\r\n\r\n"If the fact had not been," said Hester, "as Mrs Howell states it, that\r\nthe epidemic prevails partially everywhere."\r\n\r\n"There is a case where Lady Hunter\'s example immediately operates,"\r\nobserved Dr Levitt.  "If Lady Hunter had not forgotten herself in her\r\nduty, Mrs Howell would have given the benefit of her good offices to\r\nsome whom she might have served; for she is really a kind-hearted woman:\r\nbut she is struck with a panic because Lady Hunter is, and one cannot\r\nget a word with her or Miss Miskin."\r\n\r\n"I saw that her shutters were nearly closed," observed Margaret.  "I\r\nsupposed she had lost some relation."\r\n\r\n"No: she is only trying to shut out the fever.  She and Miss Miskin are\r\nafraid of the milkman, and each tries to put upon the other the peril of\r\nserving a customer.  This panic will destroy us if it spreads."\r\n\r\nThe sisters looked at each other, and in one glance exchanged agreement\r\nthat the time was fully come for them to act abroad, let what would\r\nbecome of their home comforts.\r\n\r\n"I ought to add, however," said Dr Levitt, "that Sir William Hunter has\r\nsupplied my poor\'s purse with money very liberally.  I spend his money\r\nas freely as my own at a time like this; but I tell him that one hour of\r\nhis presence among us would do more good than all the gold he can send.\r\nHis answer comes in the shape of a handsome draft on his banker,\r\nsmelling strongly of aromatic vinegar.  They fumigate even their\r\nblotting-paper, it seems to me.  I did hope my last letter would have\r\nbrought him to call."\r\n\r\n"Our friends are very ready with their money," said Hope.  "I should\r\nhave begged of you before this, but that Mr Grey has been liberal in\r\nthat way.  He concludes it to be impossible that he should look himself\r\ninto the wants of the village; but he permits me to use his purse pretty\r\nfreely.  Is there anything that you can suggest that can be done by me,\r\nDr Levitt?  Is there any case unknown to me where I can be of service?"\r\n\r\n"Or I?" said Margaret.  "My brother and sister will spare me, and put up\r\nwith some hardship at home, I know, if you can point out any place where\r\nI can be more useful."\r\n\r\n"To be sure I can.  Much as I like to come to your house, to witness and\r\nfeel the thorough comfort which I always find in it, I own I shall care\r\nlittle to see everything at sixes and sevens here for a few weeks, if\r\nyou will give me your time and talents for such services as we gentlemen\r\ncannot perform, and as we cannot at present hire persons to undertake.\r\nYou see I take you at your word, my dear young lady.  If you had not\r\noffered, I should not have asked you: as you have, I snatch at the good\r\nyou hold out.  I mean to preach a very plain sermon next Sunday on the\r\nduties of neighbours in a season of distress like this: and I shall do\r\nit with the better hope, if I have, meanwhile, a fellow-labourer of your\r\nsex, no less valuable in her way than my friend Hope in his."\r\n\r\n"I shall come and hear your sermon," said Hester, "if Margaret will take\r\ncharge of my boy for the hour.  I want to see clearly what is my duty at\r\na time when claims conflict as they do now."\r\n\r\nThere was at present no time for the conscientious and charitable to\r\nlose in daylight loiterings over the table, or chat by the fireside.  In\r\na few minutes the table was cleared, and Margaret ready to proceed with\r\nDr Levitt to the Platts\' Cottage.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Margaret saw what was the real state of affairs in the\r\ncottage, she sent away Dr Levitt, who could be of no use till some\r\ndegree of decency was instituted in the miserable abode.  What to set\r\nabout first was Margaret\'s difficulty.  There was no one to help her but\r\nMrs Platt\'s mother, who was sitting down to wait the result of the\r\nfortune-teller\'s predictions.  Her daughter lay moaning on a bedstead\r\nspread with shavings only, and she had no covering whatever but a\r\nblanket worn into a large hole in the middle.  The poor woman\'s long\r\nhair, unconfined by any cap, strayed about her bare and emaciated\r\nshoulders, and her shrunken bands picked at the blanket incessantly,\r\neverything appearing to her diseased vision covered with black spots.\r\nNever before had so squalid an object met Margaret\'s eyes.  The husband\r\nsat by the empty grate, stooping and shrinking, and looking at the floor\r\nwith an idiotic expression of countenance, as appeared through the\r\nhandkerchief which was tied over his head.  He was just sinking into the\r\nfever.  His boy lay on a heap of rags in the corner, his head also tied\r\nup, but the handkerchief stiff with the black blood which was still\r\noozing from his nose, ears, and mouth.  It was inconceivable to Margaret\r\nthat her brother, with Mr Grey\'s money in his pocket, could have left\r\nthe family in this state.  He had not.  There were cinders in the hearth\r\nwhich showed that there had been a fire; and the old woman acknowledged\r\nthat a pair of sheets and a rug had been pawned to the fortune-teller in\r\nthe lane since the morning.  There had been food; but nobody had any\r\nappetite but herself, and she had eaten it up.  The fortune-teller had\r\ncharmed the pail of fresh water that stood under the bed, and had\r\npromised a new spell in the morning.\r\n\r\nIn a case of such extremity, Margaret had no fears.  She set forth alone\r\nfor the fortune-teller\'s, not far off, and redeemed the sheets and\r\nblanket, which were quite clean.  As she went, she was sorry she had\r\ndismissed Dr Levitt so soon.  As a magistrate, he could have\r\nimmediately compelled the restoration of the bedding.  The use of his\r\nname, however, answered the purpose, and the conjurer even offered to\r\ncarry the articles for her to Platt\'s house.  She so earnestly desired\r\nto keep him and her charge apart, that she preferred loading herself\r\nwith the package.  Then the shavings were found to be in such a state\r\nthat every shred of them must be removed before the sick man could be\r\nallowed to lie down.  No time was to be lost.  In the face of the old\r\nwoman\'s protestations that her daughter should not stir, Margaret spread\r\nthe bedding on the floor, wrapped the sick woman in a sheet, and laid\r\nher upon it, finding the poor creature so light from emaciation that she\r\nwas as easy to lift as a child.  The only thing that the old woman would\r\nconsent to do, was to go with a pencil note to Mr Grey, and bring back\r\nthe clean dry straw which would be given her in his yard.  She went, in\r\nhopes of receiving something else with the straw; and while she was\r\ngone, Margaret was quite alone with the sick family.\r\n\r\nStruggling to surmount her disgust at the task, she resolved to employ\r\nthe interval in removing the shavings.  The pail containing the charmed\r\nwater was the only thing in the cottage which would hold them; and she\r\nmade bold to empty it in the ditch close at hand.  Platt was capable of\r\nwatching all she did; and he made a frightful gesture of rage at her as\r\nshe re-entered.  She saw in the shadow of the handkerchief his quivering\r\nlips move in the act of speaking, and her ear caught the words of an\r\noath.  Her situation now was far from pleasant; but it was still a\r\nrelief that no one was by to witness what she saw and was doing.  She\r\nconveyed pailful after pailful of the noisome shavings to the dunghill\r\nat the back of the cottage, wondering the while that the inhabitants of\r\nthe dwelling were not all dead of the fever long ago.  She almost gave\r\nover her task when a huge toad crawled upon her foot from its\r\nresting-place among the shavings.  She shrunk from it, and was glad to\r\nsee it make for the door of its own accord.  Platt again growled, and\r\nclenched his fist at her.  He probably thought that she had again broken\r\na charm for which he had paid money.  She spoke kindly and cheerfully,\r\nagain and again; but he was either deaf or too ill to understand.  To\r\nrelieve the sense of dreariness, she went to work again.  She thoroughly\r\ncleansed the pail, and filled it afresh from the brook, looking\r\nanxiously down the lane for the approach of some human creature, and\r\nthen applied herself to rubbing the bedstead as dry and clean as she\r\ncould, with an apron of the old woman\'s.\r\n\r\nIn due time her messenger returned; and with her Ben, carrying a truss\r\nof straw.  His face was the face of a friend.\r\n\r\n"We must have some warm water, Ben, to clean these poor creatures; and\r\nthere seems to be nothing to make a fire with."\r\n\r\n"And it would take a long time, Miss, to get the coals, and heat the\r\nwater; and the poor soul lying there all the time.  Could not I bring\r\nyou a pail of hot water from the `Bonnet-so-Blue\' quicker than that?"\r\n\r\n"Do; and soap and towels from home."\r\n\r\nBen was gone with the pail.  During the whole time of spreading the\r\nstraw on the bedstead, the old woman remonstrated against anything being\r\ndone to her daughter, beyond laying her where she was before, and giving\r\nher a little warm spirits; but when she discovered that the charmed\r\nwater had been thrown out into the ditch, all to her seemed over.  Her\r\nlast hope was gone; and she sat down in sulky silence, eyeing Margaret\'s\r\nproceedings without any offer to help.\r\n\r\nWhen the warm water arrived, and the sick woman seemed to like the\r\nsponging and drying of her fevered limbs, the mother began to relent,\r\nand at last approached to give her assistance, holding her poor daughter\r\nin her arms while Margaret spread the blanket and sheet on the straw,\r\nand then lifting the patient into the now clean bed.  She was still\r\nunwilling to waste any time and trouble on the child in the corner; but\r\nMargaret was peremptory.  She saw that he was dying; but not the less\r\nfor this must he be made as comfortable as circumstances would permit.\r\nIn half an hour he, too, was laid on his bed of clean straw; and the\r\nfilthy rags with which he had been surrounded were deposited out of\r\ndoors till some one who would wash them could come for them.  By a\r\npromise of fire and food, Margaret bribed the old woman to let things\r\nremain as they were while she went for her brother, whose skill and care\r\nshe hoped might now have some chance of saving his patients.  She\r\nrecommended that Platt himself should not attempt to sit up any longer,\r\nand engaged to return in half an hour.\r\n\r\nShe paused on the threshold a minute, to see how far Platt was able to\r\nwalk; so great seemed to be the difficulty with which he raised himself\r\nfrom his chair, with the old woman\'s assistance.  Once he stumbled, and\r\nwould have fallen, if Margaret had not sprung to his side.  On\r\nrecovering himself; he wrenched his arm from her, and pushed her\r\nbackwards with more force than she had supposed he possessed.  There was\r\na half-smile on the old woman\'s face as he did this, which made Margaret\r\nshudder; but she was more troubled by a look from the man, which she\r\ncaught from beneath the handkerchief that bound his head; a look which\r\nshe could not but fancy she had met before with the same feeling of\r\nuneasiness.\r\n\r\nWhen she had seen him safely seated on the bedside, she hastened away\r\nfor her brother.  They lost no more time in returning than just to step\r\nto Widow Rye\'s, to ask whether she would sit up with this miserable\r\nfamily this night.  The widow would have done anything else in the world\r\nfor Mr Hope; and she did not positively refuse to do this; but the fear\r\nof her neighbours had so infected her, and her terror of a sick-room was\r\nso extreme, that it was evident her presence there would do more harm\r\nthan good.  She was glad to compound for a less hazardous service, and\r\nagreed to wash for the sick with all diligence, if she was not required\r\nto enter the houses, but might fetch the linen from tubs of water placed\r\noutside the doors.  After setting on plenty of water to heat, she now\r\nfollowed Hope and Margaret to the cottage in the lane.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly dark, and they walked rapidly, Margaret describing as they\r\nwent what she had done, and what she thought remained to be done, to\r\ngive Mrs Platt a chance of recovery.\r\n\r\n"What now?  Why do you start so?" cried Hope, as she stopped short in\r\nthe middle of a sentence.\r\n\r\nMargaret even stood still for one moment.  Hope looked the way she was\r\nlooking, and saw, in the little twilight that remained, the figure of\r\nsome one who had been walking on the opposite side of the road, but\r\nwhose walk was now quickened to a run.\r\n\r\n"It is--it is he," said Hope, as Philip disappeared in the darkness.\r\nAnswering to what he knew must be in Margaret\'s thoughts, he continued--\r\n\r\n"He knows the state the village is in--the danger that we are all in,\r\nand he cannot stay away."\r\n\r\n"`We!\'  `All?\'"\r\n\r\n"When I say `we,\' I mean you particularly."\r\n\r\n"If you think so--" murmured Margaret, and stopped for breath.\r\n\r\n"I think so; but it does not follow that there is any change.  He has\r\nalways loved you.  Margaret, do not deceive yourself.  Do not afflict\r\nyourself with expectations--"\r\n\r\n"Do not speak to me, brother.  I cannot bear a word from you about him."\r\n\r\nHope sighed deeply, but he could not remonstrate.  He knew that Margaret\r\nhad only too much reason for saying this.  They walked on in entire\r\nsilence to the lane.\r\n\r\nA fire was now kindled, and a light dimly burned in Platt\'s cottage.  As\r\nMargaret stood by the bedside, watching her brother\'s examination of his\r\npatient, and anxious to understand rightly the directions he was giving,\r\nthe poor woman half raised her head from her pillow, and fixed her dull\r\neyes on Margaret\'s face, saying, as if thinking aloud:\r\n\r\n"The lady has heard some good news, sure.  She looks cheerful-like."\r\n\r\nThe mother herself turned round to stare, and, for the first time,\r\ndropped a curtsey.\r\n\r\n"I hope we shall see you look cheerful too, one day soon, if we nurse\r\nyou well," said Margaret.\r\n\r\n"Then, Miss, don\'t let them move me, to take the blankets away again."\r\n\r\n"You shall not be moved unless you wish it.  I am going to stay with you\r\nto-night."\r\n\r\nHer brother did not oppose this, for he did not know of the unpleasant\r\nglances and mutterings, with which Platt rewarded all Margaret\'s good\r\noffices.  Hope believed he should himself be out all night among his\r\npatients.  He would come early in the morning, and now fairly warned\r\nMargaret that it was very possible that the child might die in the\r\ncourse of the night.  She was not deterred by this, nor by her dread of\r\nthe sick man.  She had gained a new strength of soul, and this night she\r\nfeared nothing.  During the long hours there was much to do--three\r\nsufferers at once requiring her cares; and amidst all that she did, she\r\nwas sustained by the thought that she had seen Philip, and that he was\r\nnear.  The abyss of nothingness was passed, and she now trod the ground\r\nof certainty of his existence, and of his remembrance.  When her brother\r\nentered, letting in the first grey of the morning as he opened the\r\ncottage door, he found her almost untired, almost gay.  Platt was worse,\r\nhis wife much the same, and the child still living.  The old woman\'s\r\nheart was so far touched with the unwonted comfort of the past night,\r\nand with her having been allowed, and even encouraged, to take her rest,\r\nthat she now offered her bundle of clothes for the lady to lie down\r\nupon; and when that favour was declined, readily promised not to part\r\nwith any article to the fortune-teller, till she should see some of Mr\r\nHope\'s family again.\r\n\r\nHope thought Mrs Platt might possibly get through: and this was all\r\nthat was said on the way home.  Margaret lay down to rest, to sweet\r\nsleep, for a couple of hours: and when she appeared below, her brother\r\nand sister had half done breakfast, and Mr Grey and his twin daughters\r\nwere with them.\r\n\r\nMr Grey came to say that he and all his family were to leave Deerbrook\r\nin two hours.  Where they should settle for the present, they had not\r\nyet made up their minds.  The first object was to get away, the epidemic\r\nbeing now really too frightful to be encountered any longer.  They\r\nshould proceed immediately to Brighton, and there determine whether to\r\ngo to the Continent, or seek some healthy place nearer home, to stay in,\r\ntill Deerbrook should again be habitable.  They were extremely anxious\r\nto carry Hester, Margaret, and the baby, with them.  They knew Mr Hope\r\ncould not desert his posts: but they thought he would feel as Dr Levitt\r\ndid, far happier to know that his family were out of danger, than to\r\nhave them with him.  Hester had firmly refused to go, from the first\r\nmention of the plan; and now Margaret was equally decided in expressing\r\nher determination to stay.  Mr Grey urged the extreme danger: Fanny and\r\nMary hung about her, and implored her to go, and to carry the baby with\r\nher.  They should so like to have the baby with them for a great many\r\nweeks! and they would take care of him, and play with him all day long.\r\nTheir father once more interposed for the child\'s sake.  Hester might go\r\nto Brighton, there wean her infant, and return to her husband; so that\r\nthe little helpless creature might at least be safe.  Mr Grey would not\r\nconceal that he considered this a positive duty--that the parents would\r\nhave much to answer for, if anything should happen to the boy at home.\r\nThe parents\' hearts swelled.  They looked at each other, and felt that\r\nthis was not a moment in which to perplex themselves with calculations\r\nof incalculable things--with comparisons of the dangers which threatened\r\ntheir infant abroad and at home.  This was a decision for their hearts\r\nto make.  Their hearts decided that their child\'s right place was in his\r\nparents\' arms; and that their best hope now, as at all other times, was\r\nto live and die together.\r\n\r\nHester had heard from her husband of the apparition of the preceding\r\nevening, and she therefore knew that there was less of `enthusiasm,\' as\r\nMr Grey called what some others would have named virtue, in Margaret\'s\r\ndetermination to stay, than might appear.  If Philip was here, how vain\r\nmust be all attempts to remove her!  Mr Grey might as well set about\r\npersuading the old church tower to go with him: and so he found.\r\n\r\n"Oh, cousin Margaret," said Mary, in a whisper, with a face of much\r\nsorrow, "mamma will not ask Miss Young to go with us!  If she should be\r\nill while we are gone!  If she should die!"\r\n\r\n"Nonsense, Mary," cried Fanny, partly overhearing, and partly guessing\r\nwhat her sister had said; "you know mamma says it is not convenient: and\r\nMiss Young is not like my cousins, as mamma says, a member of a family,\r\nwith people depending upon her.  It is quite a different case, Mary, as\r\nyou must know very well.  Only think, cousin Margaret! what an odd thing\r\nit will be, to be so many weeks without saying any lessons!  How we\r\nshall enjoy ourselves!"\r\n\r\n"But if Miss Young should be ill, and die!" persisted Mary.\r\n\r\n"Pooh! why should she be ill and die, more than Dr Levitt, and Ben, and\r\nour cook, and my cousins, and all that are going to stay behind?\r\nMargaret, I do wish cousin Hester would let us carry the baby with us.\r\nWe shall have no lessons to do, you know; and we could play with him all\r\nday long."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I wish he might go," said Mary.  "But, Margaret, do you not think,\r\nif you spoke a word to papa and mamma, they would let me stay with Miss\r\nYoung?  I know she would make room for me; for she did for Phoebe, when\r\nPhoebe nursed her; and I should like to stay and help her, and read to\r\nher, even if she should not be ill.  I think papa and mamma might let me\r\nstay, if you asked them."\r\n\r\n"I do not think they would, Mary: and I had rather not ask them.  But I\r\npromise you that we will all take the best care we can of Maria.  We\r\nwill try to help and amuse her as well as you could wish."\r\n\r\n"Come, Mary, we must go!" cried Fanny.  "There is papa giving Mr Hope\r\nsome money for the poor; people always go away quick after giving money.\r\nGood bye, cousin Margaret.  We shall bring you some shells, or\r\nsomething, I dare say, when we come back.  Now let me kiss the baby once\r\nmore.  I can\'t think why you won\'t let him go with us: we should like so\r\nto have him!"\r\n\r\n"So do we," said Hester, laughing.\r\n\r\nAs the door closed behind the Greys, the three looked in each other\'s\r\nfaces.  That glance assured each other that they had done right.  In\r\nthat glance was a mutual promise of cheerful fidelity through whatever\r\nmight be impending.  There was no sadness in the tone of their\r\nconversation; and when, within two hours, the Greys went by, driven\r\nslowly, because there was a funeral train on each side of the way, there\r\nwas full as much happiness in the faces that smiled a farewell from the\r\nwindows, as in the gestures of the young people, who started up in the\r\ncarriage to kiss their hands, and who were being borne away from the\r\nabode of danger and death, to spend several weeks without doing any\r\nlessons.  Often, during this day, was the voice of mirth even heard in\r\nthis dwelling.  It was not like the mirth of the well-known company of\r\nprisoners in the first French revolution--men who knew that they should\r\nleave their prison only to lose their heads, and who, once mutually\r\nacknowledging this, agreed vainly and pusillanimously to banish from\r\nthat hour all sad, all grave thoughts, and laugh till they died.  It was\r\nnot this mirth of despair; nor yet that of carelessness; nor yet that of\r\ndefiance.  Nor were theirs the spirits of the patriot in the hour of\r\nstruggle, nor of the hero in the crisis of danger.  In a peril like\r\ntheirs, there is nothing imposing to the imagination, or flattering to\r\nthe pride, or immediately appealing to the energies of the soul.  There\r\nwere no resources for them in emotions of valour or patriotism.  Theirs\r\nwas the gaiety of simple faith and innocence.  They had acted from pure\r\ninclination, from affection, unconscious of pride, of difficulty, of\r\nmerit; and they were satisfied, and gay as the innocent ought to be,\r\nenjoying what there was to enjoy, and questioning and fearing nothing\r\nbeyond.\r\n\r\nFrom a distant point of time or place, such a state of spirits in the\r\nmidst of a pestilence may appear unnatural and wrong; but experience\r\nproves that it is neither.  Whatever observers may think, it is natural\r\nand it is right that minds strong enough to be settled, either in a good\r\nor evil frame, should preserve their usual character amidst any changes\r\nof circumstance.  To those involved in new events, they appear less\r\nstrange than in prospect or in review.  Habitual thoughts are present,\r\nfamiliarising wonderful incidents; and the fears of the selfish, the\r\nrepose of the religious, the speculations of the thoughtful, and the\r\ngaiety of the innocent, pervade the life of each, let what will be\r\nhappening.\r\n\r\nYet to the prevailing mood the circumstances of the time will interpose\r\nan occasional check.  This very evening, when Margaret was absent at the\r\ncottage in the lane, and Hope, wearied with his toils among the sick all\r\nthe night, and all this day, was apparently sleeping for an hour on the\r\nsofa, Hester\'s heart grew heavy, as she lulled her infant to rest by the\r\nfire.  As she thought on what was passing in the houses of her\r\nneighbours, death seemed to close around the little being she held in\r\nher arms.  As she gazed in his face, watching the slumber stealing on,\r\nshe murmured over him--\r\n\r\n"Oh, my child, my child! if I should lose you, what _should_ I do?"\r\n\r\n"Hester! my love!" said her husband, in a tone of tender remonstrance,\r\n"what _do_ you mean?"\r\n\r\n"I did not think you would hear me, love; but I thank you.  What did I\r\nmean?  Not exactly what I said; for God knows, I would strive to part\r\nwillingly with whatever he might see fit to take away.  But, oh, Edward!\r\nwhat a struggle it would be! and how near it comes to us!  How many\r\nmothers are now parting from their children!"\r\n\r\n"God\'s will be done!" cried Hope, starting up, and standing over his\r\nbabe.\r\n\r\n"Are you sure, Edward may we feel quite certain that we have done\r\nrightly by our boy in keeping him here?"\r\n\r\n"I am satisfied, my love."\r\n\r\n"Then I am prepared.  How still he is now!  How like death it looks!"\r\n\r\n"What, that warm, breathing sleep!  No more like death than his laugh is\r\nlike sin."\r\n\r\nAnd Hope looked about him for pencil and paper, and hastily sketched his\r\nboy in all the beauty of repose, before he went forth again among the\r\nsick and wretched.  It was very like; and Hester placed it before her as\r\nshe plied her needle, all that long solitary evening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FORTY TWO.\r\n\r\nCHURCH-GOING.\r\n\r\nHester went to church the next Sunday, as she wished, to hear Dr\r\nLevitt\'s promised plain sermon on the duties of the times.  Margaret\r\ngladly staid at home with the baby, thankful for the relief from the\r\nsight of sickness, and for the quiet of solitude while the infant slept.\r\nEdward was busy among those who wanted his good offices, as he now was,\r\nalmost without intermission.  Hester had to go alone.\r\n\r\nEverything abroad looked very strange--quite unlike the common Sunday\r\naspect of the place.  The streets were empty, except that a party of\r\nmourners were returning from a funeral.  Either people were already all\r\nin church, or nobody was going.  She quickened her pace in the fear that\r\nshe might be late, though the bell seemed to assure her that she was\r\nnot.  Widow Rye\'s little garden-plot was all covered with linen put out\r\nto dry, and Mrs Rye might be seen through the window, at the wash-tub.\r\nThe want of fresh linen was so pressing, that the sick must not be kept\r\nwaiting, though it was Sunday.  Miss Nares and Miss Flint were in\r\ncurl-papers, plying their needles.  They had been up all night, and were\r\nnow putting the last stitches to a suit of family mourning, which was to\r\nenable the bereaved to attend afternoon church.  Miss Nares looked quite\r\nhaggard, as she well might, having scarcely left her seat for the last\r\nfortnight, except to take orders for mourning, and to snatch a scanty\r\nportion of rest.  She had endeavoured to procure an additional\r\nwork-woman or two from among her neighbours, and then from Blickley: but\r\nher neighbours were busy with their domestic troubles, and the Blickley\r\npeople wanted more mourning than the hands there could supply; so Miss\r\nNares and Miss Flint had been compelled to work night and day, till they\r\nboth looked as if they had had the sickness, and were justified in\r\nsaying that no money could pay them for what they were undergoing.  They\r\nbegan earnestly to wish what they had till now deprecated--that Dr\r\nLevitt might succeed in inducing some of his flock to forego the\r\npractice of wearing mourning.  But of this there was little prospect:\r\nthe people were as determined upon wearing black, as upon having the\r\nbell tolled for the dead; and Miss Nares\'s heart sank at the prospect\r\nbefore her, if the epidemic should continue, and she should be able to\r\nget no help.\r\n\r\nAlmost every second house in the place was shut up.  The blank windows\r\nof the cottages, where plants or smiling faces were usually to be seen\r\non a Sunday morning, looked dreary.  The inhabitants of many of the\r\nbetter dwellings were absent.  There were no voices of children about\r\nthe little courts; no groups of boys under the churchyard wall.  Of\r\nthose who had frequented this spot, several were under the sod; some\r\nwere laid low in fever within the houses; and others were with their\r\nparents, forming a larger congregation round the fortune-tellers\' tents\r\nin the lanes, than Dr Levitt could assemble in the church.\r\n\r\nHester heard the strokes of the hammer and the saw as she passed the\r\nclosed shop of the carpenter, who was also the undertaker.  She knew\r\nthat people were making coffins by candlelight within.  Happening to\r\nlook round after she had passed, she saw a woman come out, wan in\r\ncountenance, and carrying under her cloak something which a puff of wind\r\nshowed to be an infant\'s coffin--a sight from which every young mother\r\naverts her eyes.  As Hester approached a cottage whose thatch had not\r\nbeen weeded for long, she was startled by a howl and whine from within;\r\nand a dog, emaciated to the last degree, sprang upon the sill of an open\r\nwindow.  A neighbour who perceived her shrink back, and hesitate to\r\npass, assured her that she need not be afraid of the dog.  The poor\r\nanimal would not leave the place, whose inmates were all dead of the\r\nfever.  The window was left open for the dog\'s escape; but he never came\r\nout, though he looked famished.  Some persons had thrown in food at\r\nfirst; but now no one had time or thought to spare for dogs.\r\n\r\nMr Walcot issued from a house near the church as Hester passed, and he\r\nstopped her.  He was roused or frightened out of his usual simplicity of\r\nmanner, and observed, with an air of deep anxiety, that he trusted Mr\r\nHope had better success with his patients than he could boast of.  The\r\ndisease was most terrific: and the saving of a life was a chance now\r\nseemingly too rare to be reckoned on.  It really required more strength\r\nthan most men had to stand by their duty at such a time, when they could\r\ndo little more than see their patients die.  Hester thought him so much\r\nmoved, that he was at this moment hardly fit for business.  She said:\r\n\r\n"We all have need of all our strength.  I do not know whether worship\r\ngives it to you as it does to me.  Will it not be an hour, or even half\r\nan hour, well spent, if you go with me there?" pointing to the church.\r\n"You will say you are wanted elsewhere; but will you not be stronger and\r\ncalmer for the comfort you may find there?"\r\n\r\n"I should like it...  I have always been in the habit of going to\r\nchurch...  It would do me good, I know.  But, Mrs Hope, how is this?  I\r\nthought you had been a dissenter.  I always said so.  I have been very\r\nwrong--very ill-natured."\r\n\r\n"I am a dissenter," said Hester, smiling, "but you are not; and\r\ntherefore I may urge you to go to church.  As for the rest of the\r\nmystery, I will explain it when we have more time.  Meanwhile, I hope\r\nyou do not suppose that dissenters do not worship and need and love\r\nworship as other people do!"\r\n\r\nMr Walcot replied by timidly offering his arm, which Hester accepted,\r\nand they entered the church together.\r\n\r\nThe Rowlands were already in their pew.  There was a general commotion\r\namong the children when they saw Mrs Hope and Mr Walcot walking up the\r\naisle arm-in-arm.  Matilda called her mother\'s attention to the\r\nremarkable fact, and the little heads all whispered together.  The\r\nchurch looked really almost empty.  There were no Hunters, with their\r\ntrain of servants: there were no Levitts.  The Miss Andersons had not\r\nentered Deerbrook for weeks; and Maria Young sat alone in the large\r\ndouble pew commonly occupied by her scholars.  There was a sprinkling of\r\npoor; but Hester observed that every one in the church was in mourning\r\nbut Maria and herself.  It looked sadly chill and dreary.  The sights\r\nand sounds she had met, and the aspect of the place she was in, disposed\r\nher to welcome every thought of comfort that the voice of the preacher\r\ncould convey.\r\n\r\nThere were others to whom consolation appeared even more necessary than\r\nto herself.  Philip Enderby had certainly seen her, and was distressed\r\nat it.  He could not have expected to meet her here; and his\r\ndiscomposure was obvious.  He looked thin, and grave,--not to say\r\nsubdued.  Hester was surprised to find how she relented towards him, the\r\nmoment she saw he was not gay and careless, and how her feelings grew\r\nsofter and softer under the religious emotions of the hour.  She was so\r\nnear forgiving him, that she was very glad Margaret was not by her side.\r\nIf she could forgive, how would it be with Margaret?\r\n\r\nThe next most melancholy person present, perhaps, was Mr Walcot.  He\r\nknew that the whole family of the Rowlands remained in Deerbrook from\r\nMrs Rowland\'s ostentation of confidence in his skill.  He knew that Mr\r\nRowland would have removed his family when the Greys departed, but that\r\nthe lady had refused to go; and he felt how groundless was her\r\nconfidence: not that he had pretended to more professional merit than he\r\nhad believed himself to possess; but that, amidst this disease, he was\r\nlike a willow-twig in the stream.  He became so impressed with his\r\nresponsibilities now, in the presence of the small and sad-faced\r\ncongregation, that he could not refrain from whispering to Hester, that\r\nhe could never be thankful enough that Mr Hope had not left Deerbrook\r\nlong ago, and that he hoped they should be friends henceforth,--that Mr\r\nHope would take his proper place again, and forgive and forget all that\r\nhad passed.  He thought he might trust Mr Hope not to desert him and\r\nDeerbrook now.  Hester smiled gently, but made no reply, and did not\r\nappear to notice the proffered hand.  It was no time or place to ratify\r\na compact for her husband in his absence.  All this time, Mr Walcot\'s\r\ncountenance and manner were sufficiently subdued: but his agitation\r\nincreased when the solemn voice of Dr Levitt uttered the prayer--\r\n\r\n"Have pity upon us, miserable sinners, who now are visited with great\r\nsickness and mortality."\r\n\r\nHere the voice of weeping became so audible from the lower part of the\r\nchurch, that the preacher stopped for a moment, to give other people,\r\nand possibly himself, time to recover composure.  He then went on--\r\n\r\n"That, like as Thou didst then accept of an atonement, and didst command\r\nthe destroying angel to cease from punishing, so it may now please thee\r\nto withdraw from us this plague and grievous sickness; through Jesus\r\nChrist, our Lord."\r\n\r\nEvery voice in the church uttered `Amen,\' except Mr Walcot\'s.  He was\r\nstruggling with his sobs.  Unexpected and excessive as were the tokens\r\nof his grief, Hester could not but respect it.  It was so much better\r\nthan gross selfishness and carelessness, that she could pity and almost\r\nhonour it.  She felt that Mr Walcot was as far superior to the quacks\r\nwho were making a market of the credulity of the suffering people, as\r\nher husband, with his professional decision, his manly composure, and\r\nhis forgetfulness of the injuries of his foes in their hour of\r\nsuffering, was above Mr Walcot.  The poor young man drank in, as if\r\nthey were direct from Heaven, the suggestions contained in the\r\npreacher\'s plain sermon on the duties of the time.  Plain it was\r\nindeed,--familiarly practical to an unexampled degree; so that most of\r\nhis hearers quitted the church with a far clearer notion of their\r\nbusiness as nurses and neighbours than they had ever before had.  The\r\neffect was visible as they left their seats, in the brightening of their\r\ncountenances, and the increased activity of their step as they walked.\r\n\r\n"There, go," said Hester, kindly, to her companion.  "Many must be\r\nwanting you: but you have lost no time by coming here."\r\n\r\n"No, indeed.  But Mr Hope--"\r\n\r\n"Rely upon him.  He will do his duty.  Go and do yours."\r\n\r\n"God bless you!" cried Walcot, squeezing her hand affectionately.\r\n\r\nMrs Rowland saw this, as she always saw everything.  She beckoned to\r\nMr Walcot, with her most engaging smile, and whispered him with an air\r\nof the most intimate confidence, till she saw that her presence was\r\nwanted elsewhere, when she let him go.\r\n\r\nMr Rowland, followed by Philip, slipped out of his pew as Hester\r\npassed, and walked down the aisle with her.  He was glad to see her\r\nthere; he hoped it was a proof that all her household were well in this\r\nsickly time.  Philip bent forward to hear the answer.  Mr Rowland went\r\non to say how still and dull the village was.  The shutters up, or the\r\nblinds down, at all the Greys\' windows, looked quite sad; and he never\r\nsaw any of his friends from the corner-house in the shrubbery now.  They\r\nhad too many painful duties, he feared, to allow of their permitting\r\nthemselves such pleasures: but his friends must take care not to\r\noverstrain their powers.  They and he must be very thankful that their\r\nrespective households were thus far unvisited by the disease; and they\r\nshould all, in his opinion, favour their health by the indulgence of a\r\nlittle rational cheerfulness.  Hester smiled, aware that never had their\r\nhousehold been more cheerful than now.\r\n\r\nWhether it was that Hester\'s smile was irresistible, or that other\r\ninfluences were combined with it, it had an extraordinary effect upon\r\nPhilip.  He started forward in front of her, and offered his hand,\r\nsaying, so as to be heard by her alone--\r\n\r\n"Will you not?--I have no quarrel with you."\r\n\r\n"And can you suppose," she replied, in a tone more of compassion than of\r\nanger, "that I have none with you?--How strangely you must forget!" she\r\nadded, as he precipitately withdrew his offered hand, and turned from\r\nher.\r\n\r\n"Forget!  I forget!" he murmured, turning his face of woe towards her\r\nfor one instant.  "How little you know me!"\r\n\r\n"How little we all know each other!" said Hester, for the moment\r\ncareless what construction might be put upon her words.\r\n\r\n"Even in this place," said Dr Levitt, who had now joined them, and had\r\nheard the last words: "even in this place, where all hearts should be\r\nopen, and all resentments forgotten.  Are there any here who refuse to\r\nshake hands--at such a time as this?"\r\n\r\n"It is not for myself," said Hester, distressed: "but how can I?"\r\n\r\n"It is true; she cannot.  Do not blame her, Dr Levitt," said Philip;\r\nand he was gone.\r\n\r\nIt was this meeting which had cut short Mrs Rowland\'s whispers with Mr\r\nWalcot, and brought her down the aisle in all her stateliness, with her\r\ntrain of children behind her.\r\n\r\nWhen Hester went home, she thought it right to tell Margaret exactly\r\nwhat had happened.\r\n\r\n"I knew it?" was all that Margaret said; but her heightened colour\r\nduring the day told what unspeakable things were in her heart.\r\n\r\nHester was occupied with speculations as to what might have been the\r\nevent if Margaret had been to church instead of herself.  Her husband\r\nwould only shake his head, and look hopeless: but she still thought all\r\nmight have come right, under the influences of the hour.  Whether it\r\nwere to be wished that Philip and Margaret should understand each other\r\nagain, was another question.  Yesterday Hester would have earnestly\r\ndesired that Margaret should never see Enderby again.  To-day she did\r\nnot know what to wish.  She and Margaret came silently to the same\r\nconclusion; "there is nothing for it but waiting."  If he had heard\r\nthis, Hope would have shaken his head again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FORTY THREE.\r\n\r\nWORKING ROUND.\r\n\r\nSeveral days passed, and there was no direct news of Enderby.  Maria\r\nnever spoke of him, though many little intervals in Margaret\'s busy life\r\noccurred when the friends were together, and Maria ought have taken\r\noccasion to say anything she wished.  It was clear that she chose to\r\navoid the subject.  Her talk was almost entirely about the sick, for\r\nwhom she laboured as strenuously as her strength would permit.  She\r\ncould not go about among them, nor sit up with the sufferers: but she\r\ncooked good things over her fire for them, all day long; and she took to\r\nher home many children who were too young to be useful, and old enough\r\nto be troublesome in a sick house.  Between her cooking, teaching, and\r\nplaying with the children, she was as fully occupied as her friends in\r\nthe corner-house, and perhaps might not really know anything about Mr\r\nEnderby.\r\n\r\nEach one of the family had caught glimpses of him at one time or\r\nanother.  There was reason to think that he was active among Mr\r\nWalcot\'s poor patients; and Hope had encountered him more than once in\r\nthe course of his rounds, when a few words on the business of the moment\r\nwere exchanged, and nothing more happened.  Margaret saw him twice: once\r\non horseback, when he turned suddenly down a lane to avoid her; and at\r\nthe Rowlands\' dining-room window, with Ned in his arms.  She never now\r\npassed that house when she could help it: but this once it was\r\nnecessary; and she was glad that Philip had certainly not seen her.  His\r\nback was half-turned to the window at the moment, as if some one within\r\nwas speaking to him.  Each time, his image was so stamped in upon her\r\nmind, that, amidst all the trials of such near neighbourhood without\r\nintercourse, his presence in Deerbrook was, on the whole, certainly a\r\nluxury.  She had gained something to compensate for all her\r\nrestlessness, in the three glimpses of him with which she had now been\r\nfavoured.  A thought sometimes occurred to her, of which she was so\r\nashamed that she made every endeavour to banish it.  She asked herself\r\nnow and then, whether, if she had been able to sit at home, or take her\r\naccustomed walks, she should not have beheld Philip oftener:--whether\r\nshe was not sadly out of the way of seeing him at the cottage in the\r\nlane, and the other sordid places where her presence was necessary.  Not\r\nfor this occasional question did she stay away one moment longer than\r\nshe would otherwise have done from the cottage in the lane; but while\r\nshe was there, it was apt to recur.\r\n\r\nThere she sat one afternoon, somewhat weary, but not dreaming of going\r\nhome.  There lay the three sick creatures still.  The woman was likely\r\nto recover; the boy lingered, and seemed waiting for his father to go\r\nwith him.  Platt had sunk very rapidly, and this day had made a great\r\nchange.  Margaret had taken the moaning and restless child on her lap,\r\nfor the ease of change of posture: and she was now shading from his eyes\r\nwith her shawl, the last level rays of the sun which shone in upon her\r\nfrom the window.  She was unwilling to change her seat, for it seemed as\r\nif the slightest movement would quench the lingering life of the child:\r\nand there was no one to draw the window-curtain, the old woman having\r\ngone to buy food in the village.  Mrs Platt slept almost all the day\r\nand night through, and she was asleep now: so Margaret sat quite still,\r\nholding up her shawl before the pallid face which looked already dead.\r\nNothing broke the silence but the twitter of the young birds in the\r\nthatch, and the mutterings of the sick man, whom Margaret imagined to be\r\nsomewhat disturbed by the unusual light that was in the room.  It had\r\nnot been the custom of the sun to shine into any houses of late; and the\r\nplace full of yellow light, did not look like itself.  She knew that in\r\na few minutes the sun would have set; and she hoped that then poor Platt\r\nwould be still.  Meantime she appeared to take no notice, but sat with\r\nher eyes fixed on the boy\'s face, marking that each sigh was fainter\r\nthan the last.  At length a louder sound than she had yet heard from the\r\nsick man, made her look towards him; and the instant throb of her heart\r\nseemed to be felt by the child, for he moved his head slightly.  Platt\r\nwas trying to support himself upon his elbow, while in the other shaking\r\nhand, he held towards her her turquoise ring.  She remembered her\r\ncharge, and did not spring to seize it; but there was something in her\r\ncountenance that strongly excited the sick man.  He struggled to rise\r\nfrom his bed, and his face was fierce.  Margaret spoke gently--as calmly\r\nas she could--told him she would come presently--that there was no\r\nhurry, and urged him to lie down till she could put the child off her\r\nlap; but her voice failed her, in spite of herself; for now, at last,\r\nshe recognised in Platt the tall woman.  This was the look which had\r\nperplexed her more than once.\r\n\r\n"Patience! a little further patience!" she said to herself, as she saw\r\nthe ring still trembling in the sick man\'s hand, and felt one more sigh\r\nfrom the little fellow on her lap.  No more patience was needed.  This\r\nwas the boy\'s last breath.  His head fell back, and the sunlight, which\r\nstreamed in upon his half-closed eyes, could now disturb them no more.\r\nMargaret gently closed them and laid the body on its little bed in the\r\ncorner, straightening and covering the limbs before she turned away.\r\n\r\nShe then gently approached the bed, and took her ring into a hand which\r\ntrembled little less than the sick man\'s own.  She spoke calmly,\r\nhowever.  She strove earnestly to learn something of the facts: she\r\ntried to understand the mutterings amidst which only a word here and\r\nthere sounded like speech.  She thought, from the earnestness with which\r\nPlatt seized and pressed her hand, that he was seeking pardon from her;\r\nand she spoke as if it were so.  It grew very distressing--the\r\nearnestness of the man, and the uncertainty whether his mind was\r\nwandering or not.  She wished the old woman would come back.  She went\r\nto the door to look for her.  The old woman was coming down the lane.\r\nMargaret put on her ring, and drew on her gloves, and determined to say\r\nnothing about it at present.\r\n\r\n"Mr Platt has been talking almost ever since you went," said Margaret;\r\n"and I can make out nothing that he says.  Do try if you can understand\r\nhim.  I am sure there is something he wishes me to hear.  There is no\r\ntime to lose, I am afraid.  Do try."\r\n\r\nThe woman coaxed him to lie down, and then turning round, said she\r\nthought he wanted to know what o\'clock it was.\r\n\r\n"Is that all?  Tell him that the sun is now setting.  But if you have a\r\nwatch, that will show more exactly.  Are you sure you have no watch in\r\nthe house?"\r\n\r\nThe old woman looked suspiciously at her, and asked her what made her\r\nsuppose that poor folks had watches, when some gentlefolks had none?\r\nMargaret inquired whether a watch was not a possession handed down from\r\nfather to son, and sometimes found in the poorest cottages.  She\r\nbelieved she had seen such at Deerbrook.  The old woman replied by\r\nsaying, she believed Margaret might have understood some few things\r\namong the many the poor sick creature had been saying.  Not one,\r\nMargaret declared; but it was so plain that she was not believed, that\r\nshe had little doubt of Hester\'s watch having been harboured in this\r\nvery house, if it was not there still.\r\n\r\nThe poor boy, who had had little care from his natural guardians while\r\nalive from the hour of his being doomed by the fortune-teller, was now\r\nloudly mourned as dead.  Yet the mourning was strangely mixed with\r\nexultation at the fortune-teller having been right in the end.  The\r\nmother, suddenly awakened, groaned and screamed, so that it was fearful\r\nto hear her.  All efforts to restore quiet were in vain.  Margaret was\r\nmoved, shocked, terrified.  She could not keep her own calmness in such\r\na scene of confusion: but, while her cheeks were covered with tears,\r\nwhile her voice trembled as she implored silence, she never took off her\r\nglove.  In the midst of the tumult, Platt sank back and died.  The\r\nrenewed cries had the effect of bringing some neighbours from the end of\r\nthe lane.  While they were there, Margaret could be of no further use.\r\nShe promised to send coffins immediately--that stage of pestilence being\r\nnow reached when coffins were the first consideration--and then slipped\r\nout from the door into the darkness, and ran till she had turned the\r\ncorner of the long lane.  She usually considered herself safe abroad,\r\neven in times like these, as she carried no property of value about with\r\nher: but now that she was wearing her precious ring again, she felt too\r\nrich to be walking alone in the dark.\r\n\r\nShe did not slacken her pace till she approached lights and people; and\r\nthen she was glad to stop for breath.  She could not resist going first\r\nto Maria, to show her the recovered treasure; and this caused her to\r\ndirect her steps through the churchyard.  It was there that she came in\r\nview of lights and people; and under the limes it was that she stopped\r\nfor breath.  The churchyard was now the most frequented spot in the\r\nvillage.  The path by the turnstile was indeed grown over with grass:\r\nbut the great gate was almost always open, and the ground near it was\r\ntrodden bare by the feet of many mourners.  Funeral trains--trains which\r\ndaily grew shorter, till each coffin was now followed only by two or by\r\nthree--were passing in from early morning, at intervals, till sunset,\r\nand now might be often seen by torchlight far into the night.  The\r\nvillager passing the churchyard wall might hear, in the night air, the\r\ndeep voice of the clergyman announcing the farewell to some brother or\r\nsister, committing "ashes to ashes, and dust to dust."  There was no\r\ndisturbance now from boys leaping over the graves, or from little\r\nchildren, eager to renew their noisy play.  Such of the young villagers\r\nas remained above ground appeared to be silenced and subdued by the\r\nprivation, the dreariness, the neglect, of these awful days: they looked\r\non from afar, or avoided the spot.  Instead of such, the observer of the\r\ntwo funerals which were now in the churchyard, was a person quite at the\r\nother extremity of life.  Margaret saw the man of a hundred years, Jem\r\nBird, the pride of the village in his way, seated on the bench under the\r\nspreading tree, which was youthful in comparison with himself.  He was\r\nlistlessly watching the black figures which moved about in the light of\r\na solitary torch, by an open grave, while waiting for the clergyman who\r\nwas engaged with the group beyond.\r\n\r\n"You are late abroad, Mr Bird," said Margaret.  "I should not have\r\nlooked for you here so far on in the evening."\r\n\r\n"What\'s your will?" said the old man.\r\n\r\n"Grandfather won\'t go home ever, till they have done here," said a\r\ngreat-grandchild of the old man, running up from his amusement of\r\nhooting to the owls in the church tower.  "They\'ll soon have done with\r\nthese two, and then grandfather and I shall go home.  Won\'t we, granny?"\r\n\r\n"Does it not make you sad to see so many funerals?" said Margaret,\r\nsitting down on the bench beside him.\r\n\r\n"Ay."\r\n\r\n"Had you not better stay at home than see so many that you knew laid in\r\nthe ground?"\r\n\r\n"Does he understand?" she asked aside of the boy.  "Does he never answer\r\nbut in this way?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! he talks fast enough sometimes.  It is just as you happen to take\r\nhim."\r\n\r\nMargaret was curious to know what were the meditations among the tombs\r\nof one so aged as this man: so she spoke again.\r\n\r\n"I have heard that you knew this place before anybody lived in it: and\r\nnow you seem likely to see it empty again."\r\n\r\n"It was a wild place enough in my young time," said Jem, speaking now\r\nvery fluently.  "There was nothing of it but the church; and that was\r\nnever used, because it had had its roof pulled off in the wars.  There\r\nwas only a footpath to it through the fields then, and few people went\r\nnigh it--except a few gentry that came a-pleasuring here, into the\r\nwoods.  The owls and I knew it as well then as we do to-day, and nobody\r\nelse that is now living.  The owls and I."\r\n\r\nAnd the old man laughed the chuckling laugh which was all he had\r\nstrength for.\r\n\r\n"The woods!" said Margaret.  "Did the Verdon woods spread as far as this\r\nchurch in those days?  And were they not private property then?"\r\n\r\n"It was all forest hereabouts, except a clear space round the church\r\ntower.  It might be thin sprinkled, but it was called forest.  The place\r\nwhere I was born had thorns all about it; and when I could scarce walk\r\nalone, I used to scramble among the blossoms that made the ground white\r\nall under those thorns.  The birds that lived by the haws in winter were\r\nprodigious.  That cottage stood, as near as I can tell, where Grey and\r\nRowland\'s great granary is now.  There used to be much swine in the\r\nwoods then; and many\'s the time they have thrown me down when I was a\r\nyoung thing getting acorns.  That was about the time of my hearing the\r\nfirst music I ever heard--unless you call the singing of the birds music\r\n(we had plenty of that), and the bells on the breeze from a distance,\r\nwhen the wind was south.  The first music (so to call it) that I heard\r\nwas from a blind fiddler that came to us.  What brought him, I don\'t\r\nknow--whether he lost his way, or what; but he lost his way after he\r\nleft us.  His dog seems to have been in fault: but he got into a pool in\r\nthe middle of the wood, and there he lay drowned, with one foot up on\r\nthe bank, when I went to see what the harking of the dog could be about.\r\nHe clutched his fiddle in drowning; and I remember I tried to get the\r\nmusic out of it as it lay wet and broken on the bank, while father was\r\nsaying the poor soul must have been under the water now two days.  So I\r\nhave reason to remember the first music I heard."\r\n\r\n"You have got him talking now," said the grandchild, running off; and\r\npresently the owls were heard hooting again.\r\n\r\n"Whereabouts was this pool?" asked Margaret.\r\n\r\n"It is a deep part of the brook, that in hot summers is left a pond.  It\r\nis there that the chief of the sliding goes on in winter now, in the\r\nmeadow.  It is meadow now; but then the deer used to come down through\r\nthe wood to drink at the brook there.  That is how the village got its\r\nname."\r\n\r\n"So you remember the time when the deer came down to drink at the brook!\r\nHow many things have happened since then!  You have heard a great deal\r\nof music since those days."\r\n\r\n"Ay, there has been a good deal of fiddling at our weddings since that.\r\nAnd we have had recruiting parties through in war times."\r\n\r\n"And many a mother singing to her baby; and the psalm in the church for\r\nso many years!  Yes, the place has been full of music for long; but it\r\nseems likely to be silent enough now."\r\n\r\n"I began to think I should be left the last, as I was the first," said\r\nthe old man: "but they say the sickness is abating now, and that several\r\nare beginning to recover.  Pray God it may be so!  First, after the wood\r\nwas somewhat cleared, there was a labourer\'s cottage or two--now\r\nstanding empty, and the folk that lived in them lying yonder.  Then\r\nthere was the farmhouse; and then a carpenter came, and a wheeler.  Then\r\nthere was a shop wanted; and the church was roofed in and used: and some\r\ngentry came and sat down by the river side; and the place grew to what\r\nit is.  They say now, it is not near its end yet: but it is strange to\r\nme to see the churchyard the fullest place near, so that I have to come\r\nhere for company."\r\n\r\nAnd the old man chuckled again.  As she rose to go, Margaret asked\r\nwhether he knew the Platts, who lived in the cottage in the lane.\r\n\r\n"I know him to see to.  Is he down?"\r\n\r\n"He is dead and his child: but his wife is recovering."\r\n\r\n"Ay, there\'s many recovering now, they say."\r\n\r\n"Indeed! who?"\r\n\r\n"Why, a many.  But the fever has got into Rowland\'s house, they say."\r\nMargaret\'s heart turned sick at hearing these words, and she hastily\r\npursued her way.  It was not Philip, however, who was seized.  He was in\r\nthe churchyard at this moment.  She saw him walking quickly along the\r\nturnstile path, slackening his pace only for a moment, as he passed the\r\nfuneral group.  The light from the torch shone full upon his face--the\r\nface settled and composed, as she knew it would not be if he were aware\r\nwho was within a few paces of him.  She felt the strongest impulse to\r\nshow him her ring--the strongest desire for his sympathy in its\r\nrecovery: but an instant showed her the absurdity of the thought, and\r\nshe hung down her blushing head in the darkness.\r\n\r\nFrom Maria she had sympathy, such as it was--sympathy without any faith\r\nin Philip.  She had from her also good news of the state of the village.\r\nThere were recoveries talked of; and there would be more, now that\r\nthose who were seized would no longer consider death inevitable.  Mrs\r\nHowell was ill; and poor Miss Nares was down with the fever, which no\r\none could wonder at: but Mr Jones and his son John were both out of\r\ndanger, and the little Tuckers were likely to do well.  Mr James was\r\nalready talking of sending for his wife and sister-in-law home again, as\r\nthe worst days of the disease seemed to be past, and so many families\r\nhad not been attacked at all.  It was too true that Matilda Rowland was\r\nunwell to-day; but Mr Walcot hoped it was only a slight feverish\r\nattack, which would be thought nothing of under any other\r\ncircumstances.--On the whole, Maria thought the neighbours she had seen\r\nto-day in better spirits than at any time since the fever made its\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nMargaret found more good news at home.  In the first place, the door was\r\nopened to her by Morris.  Hester stood behind to witness the meeting.\r\nShe had her bonnet on: she was going with her husband to see Mrs\r\nHowell, and make some provision for her comfort: but she had waited a\r\nlittle while, in hopes that Margaret would return, and be duly\r\nastonished to see Morris.\r\n\r\n"You must make tea for each other, and be comfortable while we are\r\naway," said Hester.  "We will go now directly, that we may be back as\r\nearly as we can."\r\n\r\n"I have several things to tell you," said Margaret, "when you return:\r\nand one now, brother, which must not be delayed.  Platt and his child\r\nare dead, and coffins must be sent.  The sooner the better, or we shall\r\nlose the poor woman too."\r\n\r\nHope promised to speak to the undertaker as he went by.\r\n\r\n"We have become very familiar with death, Morris, since you went away,"\r\nsaid Margaret, as she obliged her old friend to sit down by the fire,\r\nand prepared to make tea for both.\r\n\r\n"That is why you see me here, Miss Margaret.  Every piece of news I\r\ncould get of this place was worse than the last; and I could perceive\r\nfrom your last letter, that you had sickness all about you; and I could\r\nnot persuade myself but that it was my duty to come and be useful, and\r\nto take care of you, my dear, if I may say so."\r\n\r\n"And now you are here, I trust you may stay--I trust we may be justified\r\nin keeping you.  We have meat every day now, Morris,--at least when we\r\nhave time to cook it.  Since my brother has been attending so many of\r\nMr Jones\'s family, we have had meat almost every day."\r\n\r\n"Indeed, my dear, I don\'t know how you could keep up without it, so busy\r\nas I find you are among the sick;--busy night and day, my mistress tells\r\nme, till the people have got to call you `the good lady.\'  You do not\r\nlook as if you had lost much of your natural rest: but I know how the\r\nmind keeps the body up.  Yours is an earnest mind, Margaret, that will\r\nalways keep you up: but, my dear, I do hope it has been an easy mind\r\ntoo.  You will excuse my saying so."\r\n\r\nMargaret more than excused it, but she could not immediately answer.\r\nThe tears trembled in her eyes, and her lip quivered when she would have\r\nspoken.  Morris stroked her hair, and kissed her forehead, as if she had\r\nbeen still a child, and whispered that all things ended well in God\'s\r\nown time.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes!  I know," said Margaret.  "Has Hester told you how prosperous\r\nwe are growing?  I do not mean only about money.  We are likely to have\r\nenough of that too, for my brother\'s old patients have almost all sent\r\nfor him again: but we care the less about that from having discovered\r\nthat we were as happy with little money as with much.  But it is a\r\nsatisfaction and pleasure to find my brother regarded more and more as\r\nhe ought to be: and yet greater to see how nobly he deserves the best\r\nthat can be thought of him."\r\n\r\n"He forgives his enemies, no doubt, heaping coals of fire on their\r\nheads."\r\n\r\n"You will witness it Morris.  You will see him among them, and it will\r\nmake your heart glow.  Poor creatures!  I have heard some of them own to\r\nhim, from their sick beds, with dread and tears, that they broke his\r\nwindows, and slandered his name.  Then you should see him smile when he\r\ntells them that is all over now, and that they will not mistake him so\r\nmuch again."\r\n\r\n"No, never.  He has shown himself now what he is."\r\n\r\n"He sat up two nights with one poor boy who is now likely to get\r\nthrough; and in the middle of the second night, the boy\'s father got up\r\nfrom his sick bed in the next room, and came to my brother, to say that\r\nhe felt that ill luck would be upon them all, if he did not confess that\r\nhe put that very boy behind the hedge, with stones in his hand, to throw\r\nat Edward, the day he was mobbed at the almshouses.  He was deluded by\r\nthe neighbours, he said, into thinking that my brother meant ill by the\r\npoor."\r\n\r\n"They have learned to the contrary now, my dear.  And what does Sir\r\nWilliam Hunter say of my master, now-a-days?  Do you know?"\r\n\r\n"There is very little heard of Sir William and Lady Hunter at present--\r\nshut up at home as they are.  But Dr Levitt, who loves to make peace,\r\nyou know, and tell what is pleasant, declares that Sir William Hunter\r\nhas certainly said that, after all, it does not so much signify which\r\nway a man votes at an election, if he shows a kind heart to his\r\nneighbours in troublesome times."\r\n\r\n"Sir William Hunter has learned his lesson then, it seems, from this\r\naffliction.  I suppose he sees that one who does his duty as my master\r\ndoes at a season like this, is just the one to vote according to his\r\nconscience at an election.  But, my dear, what sort of a heart have\r\nthese Hunters got, that they shut themselves up as you say?"\r\n\r\n"They give their money freely: and that is all that we can expect from\r\nthem.  If they have always been brought up and accustomed to fear\r\nsickness, and danger, and death, we cannot expect that they should lose\r\ntheir fear at a time like this.  We must be thankful for what they give;\r\nand their money has been of great service, though there is no doubt that\r\ntheir example would have been of more."\r\n\r\n"One would like to look into their minds, and see how they regard my\r\nmaster there."\r\n\r\n"They regard him, no doubt, so far rightly as to consider him quite a\r\ndifferent sort of person from themselves, and no rule for them.  So far\r\nthey are right.  They do not comprehend his satisfactions and ease of\r\nmind; and it is very likely that they have pleasures of their own which\r\nwe do not understand."\r\n\r\n"And they are quite welcome, I am sure, my dear, as long as they do not\r\nmeddle with my master\'s name.  That is, as he says, all over now.  After\r\nthis, however, the people in Deerbrook will be more ready to trust in my\r\nmaster\'s skill and kindness than in Sir William Hunter\'s grandeur and\r\nmoney, which can do little to save them in time of need."\r\n\r\nMargaret explained how ignorantly the poor in the neighbourhood had\r\nrelied on the fortune-tellers, who had only duped them; how that which\r\nwould have been religion in them if they had been early taught, and\r\nwhich would have enabled them to rely on the only power which really can\r\nsave, had been degraded by ignorance into a foolish and pernicious\r\nsuperstition.  Morris hoped that this also was over now.  She had met\r\nsome of these conjurors on the Blickley road; and seen others breaking\r\nup their establishment in the lanes, and turning their backs upon\r\nDeerbrook.  Whether they were scared away by the mortality of the place,\r\nor had found the tide of fortune-telling beginning to turn, mattered\r\nnothing as long as they were gone.\r\n\r\nThe tea-table was cleared, and Morris and Margaret were admiring the\r\nbaby as he slept, when Hester and her husband returned.  Mrs Howell was\r\nvery unwell, and likely to be worse.  All attempts to bring Miss Miskin\r\nto reason, and induce her to enter her friend\'s room, were in vain.  She\r\nbestowed abundance of tears, tremors, and foreboding on Mrs Howell\'s\r\nstate and prospects, but shut herself up in a fumigated apartment, where\r\nshe promised to pray for a good result, and to await it.  The maid was a\r\nhearty lass, who would sit up willingly, under Hester\'s promise that she\r\nshould be relieved in the morning.  The girl\'s fear was of not being\r\nable to satisfy her mistress, whom it was not so easy to nurse as it\r\nmight have been, from her insisting on having everything arranged\r\nprecisely as it was in her poor dear Howell\'s last illness.  As Miss\r\nMiskin had refused to enter the chamber, Hester had been obliged to\r\nsearch a chest of drawers for Mr Howell\'s last dressing-gown, which\r\nMiss Miskin had promised should be mended and aired, and ready for wear\r\nby the morning.\r\n\r\n"Margaret!" cried Hester, as her sister was lighting her candle.  The\r\nexclamation made Edward turn round, and brought back Morris into the\r\nparlour after saying `Good-night.\'  "Margaret! your ring?"\r\n\r\nThere was as much joy as shame in Margaret\'s crimson blush.  She let her\r\nsister examine the turquoise, and said:\r\n\r\n"Yes, this is the boon of to-day."\r\n\r\n"Edward\'s hundred pounds has come," said Hester: "but that is nothing to\r\nthis."\r\n\r\nMargaret\'s eyes thanked her.  She just explained that poor Platt had\r\nbeen the thief, and had restored it to her before he died, and that she\r\ncould get no explanation, no tidings of Hester\'s watch; and she was\r\ngone.\r\n\r\n"Dr Levitt\'s early stir about this ring prevented its being disposed\r\nof, I have no doubt," said Edward.  "If so, it is yet possible that we\r\nmay recover your watch.  I will speak to Dr Levitt in the morning."\r\n\r\n"Dear Margaret!" said Hester.  "She is now drinking in the hue of that\r\nturquoise, and blessing it for being unchanged.  She regards this\r\nrecovery of it as a good omen, I see; and far be it from us to mock at\r\nsuch a superstition!"\r\n\r\nAs usual, when she was upon this subject, Hester looked up into her\r\nhusband\'s face: and as usual, when she spoke on this subject, he made no\r\nreply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FORTY FOUR.\r\n\r\nLATE RELIGION.\r\n\r\nA few days after Morris\'s return, she told Margaret that the tidings in\r\nthe village of Miss Rowland\'s illness were not good.  Mrs Rowland was\r\nquite as sure as ever that, if anybody could cure Matilda, it was Mr\r\nWalcot; but Mr Walcot himself looked anxious; and a bed had been put up\r\nfor him in the room next to the sick child.  Margaret wondered why Mr\r\nRowland did not send to Blickley for further advice: but Morris thought\r\nthat Mrs Rowland would not give up her perfect faith in Mr Walcot, if\r\nall her children should die before her face.\r\n\r\nWhen Morris had left the room, Margaret was absorbed in speculations, as\r\nshe played with her sister\'s infant--speculations on the little life of\r\nchildren, and on their death.  Her memory followed Matilda through every\r\ncircumstance in which she had seen her.  The poor little girl\'s very\r\nattitude, voice, and words--words full, alas! of folly and vanity--rose\r\nagain upon her eye and ear, in immediate contrast with the image of\r\ndeath, and the solemnity of the life to come.  In the midst of these\r\nthoughts came tears of shame and self-reproach; for another thought (how\r\nlow! how selfish!) thrust itself in among them--that she was secure for\r\nthe present from Philip\'s departure--that he would not leave Deerbrook\r\nwhile Matilda was in a critical state.  As these tears rolled down her\r\ncheeks, the baby looked full in her face, and caught the infection of\r\ngrief.\r\n\r\nHe hung his little lip, and looked so woe-begone, that Margaret dashed\r\naway the signs of her sorrow, and spoke gaily to him; and, as the sun\r\nshone in at the moment upon the lustres on the mantelpiece, she set the\r\nglass-drops in motion, and let the baby try to catch the bright colours\r\nthat danced upon the walls and ceiling.  At this moment, Hester burst in\r\nwith a countenance of dismay.\r\n\r\n"Margaret, my husband has a headache!"\r\n\r\nA headache was no trifle in these days.\r\n\r\n"Anything more than a headache?" asked Margaret.  "No other feeling of\r\nillness?  There is nothing to wonder at in a mere headache.  It is very\r\nsurprising that he has not had it before, with all his toil and want of\r\nsleep."\r\n\r\n"He declares it is a trifle," said Hester: "but I see he can hardly hold\r\nup.  What shall I do?"\r\n\r\n"Make him lie down and rest, and let me go to Mrs Howell instead of\r\nyou.  She will be a little disappointed; but that cannot be helped.  She\r\nmust put up with my services to-day.  Now, do not frighten yourself, as\r\nif no one ever had a headache without having a fever."\r\n\r\n"I shall desire Morris to let no one in; and to bring no messages to her\r\nmaster while his headache lasts."\r\n\r\n"Very right.  I will tell her as I go for my bonnet.  One more kiss\r\nbefore I go, baby.  Do not wait tea for me, Hester.  I cannot say when I\r\nshall be back."\r\n\r\nMargaret had been gone to Mrs Howell\'s about an hour and a half, when\r\nthere was a loud and hasty knock at the door of the corner-house.  It\r\nroused Hope from a doze into which he had just fallen, and provoked\r\nHester accordingly.  There was a parley between Morris and somebody in\r\nthe hall; and presently a voice was heard calling loudly upon Mr Hope.\r\nHester could not prevent her husband from springing from the bed, and\r\ngoing out upon the stairs.  Mr Rowland was already half-way up, looking\r\nalmost beside himself with grief.\r\n\r\n"You must excuse me, Mr Hope--you must not judge me hardly;--if you are\r\nill, I am sorry... sir; but sir, my child is dying.  We fear she is\r\ndying, sir; and you must come, and see if anything can save her.  I\r\nshall never forgive myself for going on as we have been doing.  She has\r\nbeen sacrificed--fairly sacrificed, I fear."\r\n\r\n"Nay, Mr Rowland, I must comfort you there," said Hope, as they walked\r\nrapidly along the street.  "I have had occasion to see a great deal of\r\nMr Walcot and his professional conduct, in the course of the last few\r\nweeks; and I am certain that he has a very competent knowledge of his\r\nbusiness.  I assure you he shows more talent, more power altogether, in\r\nhis professional than his unprofessional conduct; and in this particular\r\ndisease he has now had much experience."\r\n\r\n"God bless you for saying so, my dear sir!  It is like you--always\r\ngenerous, always just and kind!  You must forgive us, Mr Hope.  At a\r\ntime like this, you must overlook all causes of offence.  They are very\r\ngreat, I know; but you will not visit them upon us now."\r\n\r\n"We have only to do with the present now," said Hope.  "Not a word about\r\nthe past, I entreat you."\r\n\r\nMrs Rowland, to-day reckless of everything but her child, was standing\r\nout on the steps, watching, as for the last hope for her Matilda.\r\n\r\n"She is much worse, Mr Hope; suddenly and alarmingly worse.  This way:\r\nfollow me."\r\n\r\nHope would speak with Mr Walcot first.  As he entered the study, to\r\nawait Mr Walcot, Philip passed out.  They did not speak.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Philip! speak to Mr Hope!" cried Mrs Rowland.  "For God\'s sake do\r\nnot do anything to offend him now!"\r\n\r\n"I will do everything in my power, madam, to save your child," said\r\nHope.  "Do not fear that the conduct of her relations will be allowed to\r\ninjure her."\r\n\r\n"My love," said Mr Rowland, "Mr Hope came from a sick bed to help us.\r\nDo not distrust him.  Indeed he deserves better from us."\r\n\r\n"Pray forgive me," said the miserable mother.  "I do not well know what\r\nI am saying.  But I will atone for all if you save my child."\r\n\r\n"Priscilla!" cried her brother, from the doorway, against which he was\r\nleaning.  His tone of wonder was lost as Walcot entered, and the study\r\nwas left for the conference of the medical men.\r\n\r\nAs the gentlemen went upstairs to Matilda\'s room, they saw one child\r\nhere, and another there, peeping about, in silence and dismay.  As Hope\r\nput his hand on the head of one in passing, Mr Rowland said:\r\n\r\n"There is a carriage coming for them presently, to take them away.  Anna\r\nand George are now with Miss Young, and she will take them all away.\r\nShe is very good: but I knew we might depend upon her--upon her heart,\r\nand her forgiveness.  Ah! you hear the poor child\'s voice.  That shows\r\nyou the way."\r\n\r\nMatilda was wandering, and, for the moment, talking very loud.\r\nSomething about grandmamma seeing her dance, and "When I am married,"\r\nstruck the ear as Hope entered her chamber, and entirely overset the\r\nmother.  Matilda was soon in a stupor again.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to hold out much prospect of her recovery.  It was\r\npainful to every one to hear how Mrs Rowland attempted to bribe Mr\r\nHope, by promises of doing him justice, to exert himself to the utmost\r\nin Matilda\'s behalf.  He turned away from her, again and again, with a\r\ndisgust which his compassion could scarcely restrain.  Philip was so far\r\nroused by the few words which had been let drop below-stairs, as to\r\nchoose to hear what passed now, in the antechamber to the patient\'s\r\nroom.  It was he who decidedly interposed at last.  He sent his\r\nbrother-in-law to Matilda\'s bedside, dismissed Mr Walcot from the room,\r\nand then said--\r\n\r\n"A very few minutes will suffice, I believe, sister, to relieve your\r\nmind: and they will be well spent.  Tell us what you mean by what you\r\nhave been saying so often within this quarter of an hour.  As you hope\r\nin Heaven--as you dare to ask God to spare your child, tell us the\r\nextent to which you feel that you have injured Mr Hope."\r\n\r\nHope sank down into the window-seat by which he had been standing.  He\r\nthought the whole story of his love was now coming out.  He waited for\r\nthe first words as for a thunderclap.  The first words were--\r\n\r\n"Oh, Philip!  I am the most wretched woman living!  I never saw it so\r\nstrongly before; I believe I did it with an idea of good to you; but I\r\nburned a letter of Margaret\'s to you."\r\n\r\n"What letter?  When?"\r\n\r\n"The day you left us last--the day you were in the shrubbery all the\r\nmorning--the day the children found the shavings burnt."\r\n\r\n"What was in the letter?  Did you read it?"\r\n\r\n"No; I dared not."\r\n\r\n"What made you burn it?"\r\n\r\n"I was afraid you would go to her, and that your engagement would come\r\non again."\r\n\r\n"Then what you told me--what made me break it off--could not have been\r\ntrue."\r\n\r\n"No, it was not--not all true."\r\n\r\n"What was true, and what was not?"\r\n\r\nMrs Rowland did not answer, but looked timidly at Mr Hope.  Now was\r\nthe moment for him to speak.\r\n\r\n"It was true," said he, "that, at the very beginning of my acquaintance\r\nwith Hester and Margaret, I preferred Margaret--and that my family\r\ndiscerned that I did--as true as that Hester has long been the beloved\r\nof my heart--beloved as--but I cannot speak of my wife, of my home, in\r\nthe hearing of one who has endeavoured to profane both.  All I need say\r\nis that neither Hester nor Margaret ever knew where my first transient\r\nfancy lighted, while they both know--know as they know their own\r\nhearts--where it has fixed.  It is not true that Margaret ever loved any\r\none but you, Enderby; and Mrs Rowland cannot truly say that she ever\r\ndid."\r\n\r\n"What was it then that Margaret confided to my mother?" asked Enderby,\r\nturning to his sister.\r\n\r\n"I cannot tell what possessed me at the time to say so, but that I\r\nthought I was doing the best for your happiness--but--but, Philip, I\r\nreally believe now, that Margaret never did love any one but you.  I\r\nknow nothing to the contrary."\r\n\r\n"But my mother?"\r\n\r\n"She knew very little of any troubles in Mr Hope\'s family; and--and\r\nwhat she did hear was all from me."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean that all you told me of Margaret\'s confidences to my mother\r\nwas false?"\r\n\r\nThere was no answer; but Mrs Rowland\'s pale cheeks grew paler.\r\n\r\n"Oh God! what can Margaret have thought of me all this time?" cried\r\nPhilip.\r\n\r\n"I can tell you what she has thought, I believe," said Hope.  "Her\r\nbrother and sister have read her innocent mind, as you yourself might\r\nhave done, if your faith in her had been what she deserved.  She has\r\nbelieved that you loved her, and that you love her still.  She has\r\nbelieved that some one--that Mrs Rowland traduced her to you: and in\r\nher generosity, she blames you for nothing but that you would not see\r\nand hear her--that you went away on the receipt of her letter--of that\r\nletter which it now appears you never saw."\r\n\r\n"Where is she?" cried Enderby, striding to the door.\r\n\r\n"She is not at home.  You cannot find her at this moment: and if you\r\ncould, you must hear me first.  You remember the caution I gave you when\r\nwe last conversed--in the abbey, and again in the meadows."\r\n\r\n"I do; and I will observe it now."\r\n\r\n"You remember that she is unaware--"\r\n\r\n"That you ever--that that interview with Mrs Grey ever took place?  She\r\nshall never learn it from me.  It is one of those facts which have\r\nceased to exist--which is absolutely dead, and should be buried in\r\noblivion.  You hear, Priscilla?"\r\n\r\nShe bowed her head.\r\n\r\n"You believe that--."\r\n\r\n"Say no more, brother.  Do not humble me further.  I will make what\r\nreparation I can--indeed I will--and then perhaps God will spare my\r\nchild."\r\n\r\nHope\'s passing reflection was, "How alike is the superstition of the\r\nignorant and of the wicked!  My poor neighbours stealing to the\r\nconjuror\'s tent in the lane, and this wretched lady, hope alike to bribe\r\nHeaven in their extremity--they by gifts and rites, she by remorse and\r\nreparation.--How different from the faith which say; `Not as I will, but\r\nas thou wilt!\'"\r\n\r\n"Where _is_ Margaret?  Will you tell me?" asked Enderby, impatiently.\r\n"But before I see her, I ought to ask forgiveness from you, Hope.  You\r\nfind how cruelly I have been deceived--by what incredible falsehood--.\r\nBut," glancing at his pale sister, "we will speak no more of that.  If,\r\nin the midst of all this error and wretchedness, I have hurt your\r\nfeelings more than my false persuasions rendered necessary...  I hope\r\nyou will forgive me."\r\n\r\n"And me!  Will you forgive me?" asked Mrs Rowland, faintly.\r\n\r\n"There is nothing to pardon in you," said Hope to Philip.  "Your belief\r\nin what your own sister told you in so much detail can scarcely be\r\ncalled a weakness; and you did and said nothing to me that was not\r\nwarranted by what you believed.--And I forgive you, madam.  I will do\r\nwhat I can to relieve your present affliction; and, as long as you\r\nattempt no further injustice towards my family, no words shall be spoken\r\nby any of us, to remind you of what is past."\r\n\r\n"You are very good, Mr Hope."\r\n\r\n"I tell you plainly," he resumed, "that you cannot injure us beyond a\r\ncertain point.  You cannot make it goodness in us to forget what is\r\npast.  It is of far less consequence to us what you and others think of\r\nus than what we think of our neighbours.  Our chief sorrow has been the\r\nspectacle of yourself in your dealings with us.  We shall be thankful to\r\nbe reminded of it no more.  And now enough of this."\r\n\r\n"Where _is_ Margaret?" again asked Enderby, as if in despair of an\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\n"She is nursing Mrs Howell.  As soon as I have seen this poor child\r\nagain, I will go home, and take care that Margaret is prepared to see\r\nyou.  Remember how great the surprise, the mystery, must be to her."\r\n\r\n"If the surprise were all--" said Philip.--"But will she hear me?  Will\r\nshe forgive me?  Will she trust me?"\r\n\r\n"Was there ever a woman who really loved who would not hear, would not\r\nforgive, would not trust?" said Hope, smiling.  "I must not answer for\r\nMargaret; but I think I may answer for woman in the abstract."\r\n\r\n"I will follow you in an hour, Hope."\r\n\r\n"Do so.  Now, madam."\r\n\r\nAnd Hope followed Mrs Rowland again to the bedside of her dying child.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FORTY FIVE.\r\n\r\nREST OF THE PLACABLE.\r\n\r\nMargaret was not at Mrs Howell\'s at the moment that her brother\r\nbelieved and said she was.  She had been there just in time to witness\r\nthe poor woman\'s departure; and she was soon home again and relating the\r\ncircumstances to Hester, by the fireside.  Even the news that Edward was\r\nnow in the same house with Philip, could not efface from her mind what\r\nshe had seen; nor could Hester help listening, though full of anxiety\r\nabout her husband.\r\n\r\n"Miss Miskin was prevailed upon to leave her room at the last, I\r\nsuppose?"\r\n\r\n"Scarcely.  Poor Nanny was supporting her mistress\'s head when I went\r\nin; and she said, with tears, that there was no depending on any one but\r\nus.  They both looked glad enough to see me: but then, nothing would\r\nsatisfy Mrs Howell but that I should warm myself, and be seated."\r\n\r\n"To the last! and she offered you some cherry-bounce, I suppose."\r\n\r\n"Yes; just as usual.  Then she told me that it would be as well to\r\nmention now, in case she should grow worse, and be in any danger, that\r\nshe should be gratified if you and I would select each a rug or screen\r\npattern from her stock, and worsteds to work it with: and she gave a\r\nbroad hint that there was one with a mausoleum and two weeping willows,\r\nwhich she hoped one of us would choose; and that perhaps her name might\r\nfill up the space on the tomb.  Poor Nanny began to cry; and this\r\naffected Mrs Howell; and she begged earnestly to see Miss Miskin."\r\n\r\n"And then she came, I suppose."\r\n\r\n"Not she!  She would not come till her friend sent a message threatening\r\nto haunt her if she did not."\r\n\r\n"Did you carry the message?"\r\n\r\n"No; but Nanny did; and, I thought, with hearty good will; Miss Miskin\r\ncame trembling, but too much frightened to cry.  She would not approach\r\nnearer than the doorway, and there fell down on her knees, and so\r\nremained the whole time she was receiving directions about the shop and\r\nthe stock,--`in case,\' as the poor soul again said, `of my getting\r\nworse, so as to be in any danger.\'  And yet Dr Levitt thought he had\r\ntold her, plainly enough, what he thought of her state this morning."\r\n\r\n"And was she aware at last? or did she go off unconsciously?"\r\n\r\n"I think she was aware; I think so from her last words--`Oh, my poor\r\ndear Howell!\'  I sat behind the curtain while she was speaking to Miss\r\nMiskin--sometimes so faintly that Nanny had to repeat her words, to make\r\nthem heard as far as the door."\r\n\r\n"That selfish wretch--Miss Miskin!"\r\n\r\n"It was very moving, I assure you, to hear not one word of reproach,--or\r\neven notice of Miss Miskin\'s desertion in this illness.  What was said\r\nwas common-place enough; but every word was kind.  I have it all.  I\r\ntook it down with my pencil, behind the curtain; for I was sure Miss\r\nMiskin would never remember it.  Mrs Howell went on till she came to\r\ndirections about the bullfinch that her poor dear Howell used to laugh\r\nto see perched upon her nightcap of a morning; and then she grew\r\nunintelligible.  I thought she was only fainting; but while we were\r\ntrying to revive her, Nanny said she was going.  Miss Miskin drew back\r\ninto the passage, shut the door, and made her escape.  Her friend looked\r\nthat way once more, and said that we had all been very good to her.  She\r\nmentioned her husband, as I told you, and then died very quietly."\r\n\r\n"Miss Miskin knows, of course?"\r\n\r\n"I told her, and did not pretend to feel much sympathy in her\r\nlamentations.  I told her she had lost a friend who would have watched\r\nover her, I believed, till her last breath, if she had been the one\r\nattacked by the fever."\r\n\r\n"What did she say?"\r\n\r\n"She exclaimed a great deal about how good we all were, and wondered\r\nwhat Deerbrook would have done without us; and said she was sure I was\r\ntoo kind to think of leaving her in the house with the corpse, with only\r\nNanny.  When I declined passing the night there, she comforted herself\r\nwith thinking aloud that her friend would not haunt her--certainly would\r\nnot haunt her--as she _had_ gone to her room at last.  Her final\r\nquestion was, how soon I thought it likely that she should feel the\r\nfever coming on, in case of her having caught it, after all, by going\r\ninto the room."\r\n\r\n"What an end to a sentimental friendship of so many years!"\r\n\r\n"I rather expect to hear in the morning that she has taken refuge in\r\nsome neighbour\'s house, and left Nanny alone with the corpse to-night."\r\n\r\n"My husband\'s knock!" cried Hester, starting up.  "How is your headache,\r\nlove?" asked she anxiously, as she met him at the room door.\r\n\r\n"Gone, quite gone," he replied.  "I must step down into the surgery for\r\na minute, about this poor little girl\'s medicine; and then I have a\r\ngreat deal to tell you."\r\n\r\nThe sisters sat in perfect silence till his return.\r\n\r\n"Matilda?" said Margaret, looking up at her brother.\r\n\r\n"She is very ill;--not likely to be better."\r\n\r\n"And poor Mrs Howell is gone," said Hester.  "What a sweep it is!  Did\r\nyou hear, love?  Mrs Howell is dead."\r\n\r\n"I hear.  It is a terrible destruction that we have witnessed.  But I\r\ntrust it is nearly over.  I know of only one or two cases of danger now,\r\nbesides this little girl\'s.  Poor Matilda!  But we have little thought\r\nto spare, even for her, to-night.  If I did not know that Margaret is\r\nready for whatever may betide," he continued, fixing his benevolent gaze\r\nupon her, "and if, moreover, I were not afraid that some one would be\r\ncoming to tell my news if I do not get it out at once, I should hesitate\r\nabout saying what I have to say."\r\n\r\n"Philip has been explaining--He is coming," said Margaret, with such\r\ncalmness as she could command.\r\n\r\n"Enderby is coming; and some one else, whose explanations are more to\r\nthe purpose, has been explaining.  Mrs Rowland, alarmed and shaken by\r\nher misery, has been acknowledging the whole series of falsehoods by\r\nwhich she persuaded, convinced her brother that you did not love him--\r\nthat you were, in fact, attached elsewhere.  I see how angry you are,\r\nHester.  I see you asking in your own mind how Enderby could be thus\r\ndeluded--how he could trust his sister rather than Margaret--how I can\r\nspeak of him as deserving to have her after all this.  Your questions\r\nare reasonable enough, love, and yet they cannot be answered.  Your\r\ndoubts of Enderby are reasonable enough; and yet I declare to you that\r\nhe is in my eyes almost, if not quite, blameless."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, brother!" said Margaret, looking up with swimming eyes.\r\n\r\n"There is one great point to be settled," resumed Hope: "and that is,\r\nwhether you will both be content to bury in silence the subject of this\r\nquarrel, from this hour, relying upon my testimony and Mrs Rowland\'s."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Edward, do not put your name and hers together!"\r\n\r\n"For Enderby\'s justification, and for Margaret\'s sake, my name shall be\r\njoined with the arch-fiend\'s, if necessary, my love.  You must, as I was\r\nsaying, rely upon the testimony of those who know the whole, that\r\nEnderby\'s conduct throughout has been, if not the very wisest and best,\r\nperfectly natural, and consistent with the love for Margaret which he\r\nhas cherished to this hour."\r\n\r\n"I knew it," murmured Margaret.\r\n\r\n"He will himself disclose as much as he thinks proper, when he comes:\r\nbut he comes full of fear and doubt about his reception."\r\n\r\nMargaret hung her head, feeling that it was well she was reminded what\r\nreason there was for his coming with doubt and trembling in his heart.\r\n\r\n"As he comes full of fear and doubt," resumed Hope, "I must tell you\r\nfirst that he never received your last letter, Margaret.  He thought you\r\nwould not answer his.  He thought you took him at his word about not\r\nattempting explanation."\r\n\r\n"What an unhappy accident!" cried Hester.  "Who carried that letter?\r\nHow did it happen?"\r\n\r\n"It was no accident, my dear.  Mrs Rowland burned that letter."\r\n\r\nMargaret covered her face with her hands; then, suddenly looking up, she\r\ncried:\r\n\r\n"Did she read it?"\r\n\r\n"No.  She says she dared not.  Why, Margaret, you seem sorry that she\r\ndid not!  You think it would have cleared you.  I have no doubt she\r\nthought so too; and that that was the reason why she averted her eyes\r\nfrom it.  Yes, it was a cruel injury, Margaret.  Can you forgive it, do\r\nyou think?"\r\n\r\n"Not to-night," said Hester.  "Do not ask it of her to-night."\r\n\r\n"I believe I may ask it at this very moment.  The happy can forgive.  Is\r\nit not so, Margaret?"\r\n\r\n"For myself I could and I do, brother.  I would go now and nurse her\r\nchild, and comfort her.  But--"\r\n\r\n"But you cannot forgive the wretchedness she has caused to Philip.\r\nWell, if you each forgive her for your own part, there is a chance that\r\nshe may yet lift up her humbled head."\r\n\r\n"What possessed her to hate us so?" said Hester.\r\n\r\n"Her hatred to us is the result of long habits of ill-will, of selfish\r\npride, and of low pertinacity about small objects.  That is the way in\r\nwhich I account for it all.  She disliked you first for your connection\r\nwith the Greys; and then she disliked me for my connection with you.\r\nShe nourished up all her personal feelings into an opposition to us and\r\nour doings; and when she had done this, and found her own only brother\r\ngoing over to the enemy, as she regarded it, her dislike grew into a\r\npassion of hatred.  Under the influence of this passion, she has been\r\nled on to say and to do more and more that would suit her purposes, till\r\nshe has found herself sunk in an abyss of guilt.  I really believe she\r\nwas not fully aware of her situation, till her misery of to-day revealed\r\nit to her."\r\n\r\n"Poor thing!" said Margaret.  "Is there nothing we can do to help her?"\r\n\r\n"We will ask Enderby.  I take hers to be no uncommon case.  The dislikes\r\nof low and selfish minds generally bear very much the character of hers,\r\nthough they may not be pampered by circumstances into such a luxuriance\r\nas in this case.  In a city, Mrs Rowland might have been an ordinary\r\nspiteful fine lady.  In such a place as Deerbrook, and with a family of\r\nrivals\' cousins incessantly before her eyes, to exercise her passions\r\nupon, she has ended in being--"\r\n\r\n"What she is," said Margaret, as Hope stopped for a word.\r\n\r\n"Margaret is less surprised than you expected, is she not?" said Hester.\r\n"You did not suppose that she would sit and listen as she does to your\r\nanalysis of Mrs Rowland.  But if the truth were known, she carries a\r\nprophecy about her on her finger.  I have no doubt she has been\r\nexpecting this very news ever since she recovered her ring.  Yes or no,\r\nMargaret?"\r\n\r\n"I should rather say she has carried a prophecy in her heart all these\r\nlong months," said Hope, "of which that on her finger is only the\r\nsymbol."\r\n\r\n"However it may be," said Hester, "it has prepared a reception for Mr\r\nEnderby.  There is no resisting a prophecy.  What is written is\r\nwritten."\r\n\r\n"I must hear him, you know," said Margaret, gently.\r\n\r\n"You must; and you must hear him favourably," said her brother.\r\n\r\n"I had forgotten," said Hester, ringing the bell.  "Morris, a good fire\r\nin the breakfast-room, immediately."\r\n\r\nWithin the hour, Philip and Margaret were by that fireside, finally\r\nwedded in heart and soul.  It was astonishing how little explanation was\r\nneeded when Margaret had once been told, in addition to the fact of her\r\nletter having been destroyed, that she was declared to have made Mrs\r\nEnderby the depository of her confidence about a prior attachment.\r\nThere was, however, as much to relate as there was little to explain.\r\nHow Enderby\'s heart burned within him, when, in sporting with the idea\r\nof a prior attachment, it came out what Margaret had felt at the moment\r\nof his intrusion upon the conference with Hope, of which he had since,\r\nas at the time, been so jealous! the amusement on her own part, and the\r\njoy on Hester\'s, which she was trying to conceal by her downcast looks!\r\nHow his soul melted within him when she owned her momentary regret at\r\nbeing saved from under the ice, and the consolation and stimulus she had\r\nderived from her brother\'s expression of affection for her on the spot!\r\nHow clear, how true a refutation were these revealings of the\r\nimputations that had been cast upon her! and how strangely had the facts\r\nbeen distorted by a prejudiced imagination!  How sweet in the telling\r\nwas the story of the ring, so sad in the experience! and the recountings\r\nof the times that they had seen each other of late.  Philip had caught\r\nmore glimpses than she.  He came down--he dared not say to watch over\r\nher in this time of sickness--but because he could not stay away when he\r\nheard of the condition of Deerbrook.  But for this sickness would they\r\nhave met--should they ever have understood each other again?  This was a\r\nspeculation on which they could not dwell--it led them too near the\r\nverge of the grave which was yawning for Matilda.  Mrs Rowland would\r\nhave been relieved, but the relief would have been not unmixed with\r\nhumiliation, if she could have known how easily she was let off in this\r\nlong conference.  Not only can the happy easily forgive, but they are\r\nexceedingly apt to forget the causes and the history of their woes; and\r\nthe wretched lady who, in the midst of her grief and terror for her\r\nchild, trembled at home at the image of the lovers she had injured, was,\r\nto those lovers in their happiness, much as if she had never existed.\r\n\r\n"Mrs Howell!" said Margaret, hearing her sister mention their departed\r\nneighbour, after Philip was gone.  "Is it possible that it was this very\r\nafternoon that I saw that poor woman die?"\r\n\r\n"Even so, dear.  How many days, or months, or years, have you lived\r\nsince?  A whole age of bliss, Margaret!"\r\n\r\nMargaret\'s blush said "Yes."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FORTY SIX.\r\n\r\nDEERBROOK IN SUNSHINE.\r\n\r\nOn the first news of the fever being gone, the Greys returned to\r\nDeerbrook, and Dr Levitt\'s family soon followed.  The place wore a\r\nstrange appearance to those who had been absent for some time.  Large\r\npatches of grass overspread the main street, and cows might have\r\npastured on the thatch of some of the cottages, while the once green\r\nchurchyard looked brown and bare from the number of new graves crowded\r\nin among the old ones.  In many a court were the spring-flowers running\r\nwild over the weedy borders, for want of hands to tend them; and the\r\nbirds built in many a chimney from which the blue smoke had been wont to\r\nrise in the morning air.  Sophia and her sisters noted these things as\r\nthey walked through the place on the morning after their arrival, while\r\ntheir father was engaged in inspecting the parish register, to learn how\r\nmany of his neighbours were gone, and their mother was paying her visit\r\nof condolence to Mrs Rowland.\r\n\r\nFanny and Mary were much impressed this day with Matilda\'s death.  They\r\nhad first wondered, and then wept, when they heard of it at a distance:\r\nand now, when once more on the spot where they had seen her daily, and\r\nhad hourly criticised her looks, her sayings, and doings, they were\r\nunder a strong sense of the meanness and frivolity of their talk, and\r\nthe unkindness of their feelings about one whose faults could hardly be\r\ncalled her own, and who might now, they supposed, be living and moving\r\nin scenes and amidst circumstances whose solemnity and importance put to\r\nshame the petty intercourse they had carried on with her here.  Both\r\nresolved in their hearts that if Anna Rowland should praise her own\r\ndancing, and flatten her back before she spoke, and talk often of the\r\ntime when she should be married, they would let it all pass, and not\r\ntell mamma or Sophia, or exchange satirical looks with each other.  They\r\nremembered now that Matilda had done good and kind things, which had\r\nbeen disregarded at the time when they were bent on ridiculing her.  It\r\nwas just hereabouts that she took off her worsted gloves, one bitter day\r\nin the winter, and put them on the hands of her little brother who was\r\ncrying with cold; and it was by yonder corner that she directed a\r\nstranger gentleman into the right road so prettily that he looked after\r\nher as she walked away, and said she would be the pride of the place\r\nsome day.  Alas! there she lay--in the vault under the church; and she\r\nwould be no one\'s pride in this world, except in her poor mother\'s\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n"There is somebody not in mourning," cried Fanny; "the very first,\r\nbesides my cousins, that we have seen to-day.  Oh, it is Mrs James!\r\nShall we not speak to her?"\r\n\r\nMrs James seemed warmed out of her usual indifference.  She shook hands\r\nalmost affectionately with Sophia.  The meeting of acquaintances who\r\nfind themselves alive after a pestilence is unlike any other kind of\r\nmeeting: it animates the most indifferent, and almost makes friends of\r\nenemies.  While Mrs James and Sophia were making mutual inquiries, Mary\r\ncalled Fanny\'s attention to what was to be seen opposite.  There was a\r\nglittering row of large, freshly-gilt letters--"Miskin, late Howell,\r\nHaberdasher, etcetera."  Miss Miskin, in the deepest mourning, with a\r\ncountenance trained to melancholy, was peeping through the ribbons and\r\nhandkerchiefs which veiled her window, to see whether the Miss Greys\r\nwere on their way to her or not.  Sophia would not have been able to\r\nresist going in, but that, on parting from Mrs James, she saw the true\r\nobject of her morning walk approaching in the person of Mr Walcot.  Her\r\nintention had been to meet him in his rounds; and here he was.\r\n\r\nIf Mrs James had been almost affectionate, what was Mr Walcot?  He had\r\nreally gone through a great deal of anxiety and suffering lately, and\r\nhis heart was very soft and tender just now.  He turned about, and\r\nwalked with Sophia--walked a mile out into the country by her side, and\r\nneither seemed to have any thought of turning back, till Fanny reminded\r\nher sister how long mamma would have been kept waiting for her to go and\r\ncall on the Levitts.  The conversation had been in an under voice, all\r\nthe way out and back; but, when the parting was to take place, when Mr\r\nWalcot was to leave them in the outskirts of the village, the little\r\ngirls heard a few words, which threw some light on what had been\r\npassing.  They caught from Sophia, "I must consult my parents;" and as\r\nthey hurried homewards with her, they ventured to cast up a glance of\r\ndroll meaning into her face, which made her try to help smiling, and to\r\nspeak sharply; and then they knew that they had guessed the truth.\r\n\r\nMr Grey made his call upon his cousins that evening.  He requested some\r\nprivate conversation with Hope.  His objects were, to learn Hope\'s\r\nopinion of Mr Walcot, as he had seen him of late under very trying\r\ncircumstances; and, if this opinion should be sufficiently favourable to\r\nwarrant the proposition, to open the subject of a partnership--a\r\npartnership in which, as was fair, Mr Walcot should have a small share\r\nat present of the income, and a large proportion of the labour--which\r\nwas all that the young man, under the effect of his recent terrors, and\r\nof his veneration for Mr Hope, wished or desired.  He had declared that\r\nif he could obtain his beloved Sophia, and be permitted to rely on Mr\r\nHope as his partner and friend, he should be the happiest man alive; and\r\nhe was confident that his parents would consider him a most fortunate\r\nyouth, to be received, at his outset into life, into such a family as\r\nMr Grey\'s, and under the professional guidance of such a practitioner\r\nand such a man as Mr Hope.\r\n\r\nThere seemed to be every probability of his becoming the happiest man\r\nalive for the Greys were clearly well disposed towards him, and Mr Hope\r\nhad nothing to say of him which could hurt their feelings.  He repeated\r\nwhat he had declared to Mr Rowland--that Mr Walcot\'s energies seemed\r\nto be concentrated in the practice of his profession, and that his\r\nprofessional knowledge appeared to be sufficient.  There was no doubt of\r\nhis kindness of heart; and, though it could not be expected of him that\r\nhe would ever make a striking figure in the world, yet he might sustain\r\na fair portion of respectability and usefulness in a country station.\r\nAs to the partnership, no difficulty arose.  Mr Grey frankly explained\r\nthat present income was far less of an object than to have his daughter\r\nsettled beside her parents, and his son-in-law usefully and honourably\r\noccupied.  Sophia would have enough money to make Walcot\'s income an\r\naffair of inferior consideration.  If he should deserve an increase by\r\nand by, it would be all very well.  If not, the young people must get on\r\nwithout.  Anything was better than sending the young man away to\r\nestablish himself in a new place, with no happier prospects to Sophia\'s\r\nfamily than that of parting with her to a distance at last.\r\n\r\nIt did not require many days to complete the arrangements.  Hester was\r\nat first a little vexed, but on the whole much more amused, at the idea\r\nof her husband having Mr Walcot for a partner: and she soon saw the\r\nadvantage of his being spared many a long country ride, and many a visit\r\nat inconvenient seasons, by his junior being at hand.  She made no\r\nsubstantial objection, and invited Mr Walcot to the house with all due\r\ncordiality.  The young man\'s gratitude and devotion knew no bounds; and\r\nthe only trouble Hope felt in the business was the awkwardness of\r\nchecking his expressions of thankfulness.\r\n\r\nWhen the announcement of the double arrangement was to be made, Mrs\r\nGrey could not resist going herself to Mrs Rowland; and Sophia was\r\nsorry that she could not be present too, to see how the lady would\r\nreceive the news of a third gentleman marrying into the Greys\'\r\nconnection so decidedly.  But Mr Grey took care to enlighten his\r\npartner on the matter some hours before; so that Mrs Rowland was\r\nprepared.  She persuaded herself that she was very apathetic--that she\r\nhad no feelings left for the affairs of life--that her interests were\r\nall buried in the tomb of her own Matilda.  Mrs Grey had therefore\r\nnothing in particular to tell Sophia when she returned from paying the\r\nvisit.\r\n\r\nIn exchange for the news, Sir William and Lady Hunter sent back their\r\ncongratulations, and a very gracious and extensive invitation to dinner.\r\nFinding that Mrs Rowland\'s brother was really, with the approbation of\r\nhis family, going to marry Mrs Hope\'s sister, and that Mrs Rowland\'s\r\n_protege_ was entering into partnership with Mr Hope himself, they\r\nthought it the right time to give their sanction to the reconciliations\r\nwhich were taking place, by being civil to all the parties round.  So\r\nLady Hunter came in state to Deerbrook, one fine day, made all due\r\napologies, and invited to dinner the whole connection.  Mrs Rowland\r\ncould not go, of course; and Margaret declined: but all the rest went.\r\nMargaret was on the eve of her marriage, and she preferred one more day\r\nwith Maria, to a visit of ceremony.  She begged Philip to go, as his\r\nsister could not; and he obeyed with a good grace, grudging the loss of\r\na sweet spring evening over Sir William Hunter\'s dinner-table the less,\r\nthat he knew Margaret and Maria were making the best use of it together.\r\n\r\nOnce more the friends sat in the summer-house, by the window, whence\r\nthey loved to look abroad upon meadow, wood, and stream.  Here they had\r\nstudied together, and cherished each other: here they had eagerly\r\nimparted a multitude of thoughts, and carefully concealed a few.  Here\r\nthey were now conversing together for the last time before their\r\napproaching separation.  Maria sighed often, as she well might: and when\r\nMargaret looked abroad upon the bean-setters in the distant field, and\r\nlistened to the bleat of the lambs which came up from the pastures, and\r\nwas aware of the scent of the hyacinths occasionally wafted in from poor\r\nMatilda\'s neighbouring flower-plot, she sighed too.\r\n\r\n"You must take some of our hyacinths with you to London, and see whether\r\nthey will not blossom there," said Maria, answering to her friend\'s\r\nthought.\r\n\r\n"I hardly know whether there would be most pain or pleasure in seeing\r\nplants sprout, and then wither, in the little balcony of a back\r\ndrawing-room, which overlooks gables or stables, instead of these\r\ndelicious green meadows."\r\n\r\n"How fond you were, two years ago, of imagining the bliss of living\r\nalways in sight of this very landscape!  Yet it has yielded already to\r\nthe back drawing-room, with a prospect of stables and gables."\r\n\r\n"We shall come and look upon your woods sometimes, you know.  I am not\r\nbidding good-bye to this place, or to you.  God forbid!"\r\n\r\n"Now tell me, Margaret," said Maria, after a pause, "tell me when you\r\nare to be married."\r\n\r\n"That is what I was just about to do.  We go on Tuesday."\r\n\r\n"Indeed! in three days!  But why should it not be so?  It is a weary\r\ntime since you promised first."\r\n\r\n"A year ago, there were reasons, as Philip admits now, why I could not\r\nleave Hester and Edward.  There are no such reasons now.  They are\r\nprosperous: their days of struggle, when they wanted me--my head, my\r\nhands, my little income--are past.  Edward\'s practice has come back to\r\nhim, with increase for Mr Walcot.  There is nothing more to fear for\r\nthem."\r\n\r\n"You have done your duty by them: now--"\r\n\r\n"_My_ duty!  What has it been to theirs?  Oh, Maria! what a spectacle\r\nhas that been!  When I think how they have `overcome evil with good,\'\r\nhow they have endured, how forgiven, how toiled and watched on their\r\nenemies\' behalf, till they have ruled all the minds, and touched all the\r\nhearts, of friends and foes for miles round, I think theirs the most\r\ngracious piece of tribulation that ever befell.  At home,--Oh, even you\r\ndo not know what a home it is!"\r\n\r\nNor was Margaret herself aware what that home was now.  She saw how\r\nEdward had there, too, `overcome evil with good\' how he had permanently\r\nestablished Hester in her highest moods of mind, strengthened her to\r\novercome the one unhappy tendency from which she had suffered through\r\nthe whole of her life, and dispersed all storms from the dwelling\r\nwherein his child was to grow up: but she did not know half the extent\r\nof his victory, or the delight of its rewards.  She knew nothing of the\r\nsecret shudder with which he looked back upon the entanglement, the\r\nperil, the suffering he had gone through; or of the deep peace which had\r\nsettled down upon his soul, now that the struggle was well past.  She\r\nlittle imagined how, when all the world regarded him as an old married\r\nman, his was now, in truth, the soul of the lover: how, from having at\r\none time pitied, feared, recoiled from her with whom he had connected\r\nhimself for life, he had risen, by dint of a religious discharge of duty\r\ntowards her, from self-reproach and mere compassion, to patience, to\r\nhope, to interest, to admiration, to love--love at last worthy of hers--\r\nlove which satisfied even Hester\'s imperious affections, and set even\r\nher over-busy mind and heart at rest.  Little did Margaret imagine all\r\nthis.  There was but one, beside Edward himself, who knew it; and that\r\none was Morris, who daily thanked God that strength had been given\r\naccording to the need.\r\n\r\n"There is but one person in the world, Maria," said her friend, "on\r\nwhose account I cannot help being anxious.  I was faithless about Hester\r\nas long as it was possible to have an uneasy thought for her; and now I\r\nam afraid I shall sin in the same way about you."\r\n\r\n"And why should you, Margaret?  If I were without object, without hope,\r\nwithout experience, without the power of self-rule which such experience\r\ngives, you might well fear for me.  But why now?  It is not reasonable\r\ntowards the Providence under which we live; it is not just to me."\r\n\r\n"That is very true.  But though it is not too much for your faith, that\r\nyou are infirm and suffering in body, poor, solitary, living by toil,\r\nwithout love, without prospect--though all this may not be too much for\r\nyour faith, Maria, I own it is at times for mine."\r\n\r\n"Of all these evils, there is but one which is very hard to bear.  I\r\n_am_ solitary; and the suffering from the sense of this is great.  But\r\nwhat has been borne may be borne; and this evil is precisely that which\r\nhas been the peculiar trial of the greatest and best of their race--or\r\nof those who have been recognised as such.  You will not suppose that I\r\ntry to flatter my pride with this thought; or that the most insane pride\r\ncould be a support under this kind of suffering.  I mean only that there\r\ncan be nothing morally fatal in a trial which many of the wisest and\r\nbest have sustained."\r\n\r\n"But it is painful--very painful."\r\n\r\n"For the mere pain, let it pass; and for the other _desagremens_ of my\r\nlot, let us not dare to speak evil of them, lest we should be slandering\r\nmy best friends.  If infirmity, toil, poverty, and the foibles of people\r\nabout us, all go to fortify us in self-reliance, God forbid that we\r\nshould quarrel with them!"\r\n\r\n"But are you sure, quite sure, that you can stand the discipline? that\r\nyour nerves, as well as your soul, can endure?"\r\n\r\n"Far from sure: but my peril is less than it was; and I have, therefore,\r\nevery hope of victory at last.  In my wilderness, some tempter or\r\nanother comes, at times when my heart is hungry, and my faith is\r\nfainting, and shows me such a lot as yours--all the sunny kingdoms of\r\nlove and hope given into your hand--and then the desert of my lot looks\r\ndreary enough for the moment; but then arises the very reasonable\r\nquestion, why we should demand that one lot should, in this exceedingly\r\nsmall section of our immortality, be as happy as another: why we cannot\r\neach husband our own life and means without wanting to be all equal.\r\nLet us bless Heaven for your lot, by all means; but why, in the name of\r\nProvidence, should mine be like it?  Nay, Margaret, why these tears?\r\nFor their sake I will tell you--and then we shall have talked quite\r\nenough about me--that you are no fair judge of my lot.  You see me\r\noften, generally, in the midst of annoyance, and you do not (because no\r\none can) look with the eye of my mind upon the future.  If you could,\r\nfor one day and night, feel with my feelings, and see through my\r\neyes--."\r\n\r\n"Oh, that I could!  I should be the holier for ever after?"\r\n\r\n"Nay, nay! but if you could do this, you would know, from henceforth,\r\nthat there are glimpses of heaven for me in solitude, as for you in\r\nlove; and that it is almost as good to look forward without fear of\r\nchance or change, as with such a flutter of hope as is stirring in you\r\nnow.  So much for the solitaries of the earth, and because Providence\r\nshould be justified of his children.  Now, when is this family meeting\r\nto take place in the corner-house?"\r\n\r\n"Frank hopes to land in August; and Anne, Mrs Gilchrist, will meet him\r\nas soon as she can hear, in her by-corner of the world, of his arrival.\r\nThe other sister is still abroad, and cannot come.  I hope Anne may be a\r\nfriend to you--an intimate.  Judging by her brothers, and her own\r\nletters, I think she must be worthy."\r\n\r\n"Thank you; but you are, and ever will be, my intimate.  There can be no\r\nother.  We shall be often seeing you here."\r\n\r\n"Sometimes; and we shall have you with us."\r\n\r\n"No: I cannot come to London.  I shall never leave this place again, I\r\nbelieve; but you will be often coming to it.  When that crowd of new\r\ngraves in the churchyard shall be waving with grass, and those old woods\r\nlooking more ancient still, and the grown people of Deerbrook telling\r\ntheir little ones all about the pestilence that swept the place at the\r\nend of the great scarcity, when _they_ were children, you and yours, and\r\nperhaps I, may sit, a knot of grey-headed friends, and hear over again\r\nabout those good old days of ours, as we shall then call them."\r\n\r\n"And tell how there was an aged man, who told us of his seeing the deer\r\ncome down through the forest to drink at the brook.  I should like to\r\nbehold those future days."\r\n\r\n"And to remember whose face you saw in the torchlight, at the time and\r\nplace of your hearing the old man\'s tale.  Whose horse do I hear\r\nstopping at the stable?"\r\n\r\n"It is Philip\'s.  He has galloped home before the rest," said Margaret,\r\ndrawing back from the window with the smile still upon her face.  "Now,\r\nMaria, before any one comes, tell me--would you like to be with me on\r\nTuesday morning or not?  Do as you like."\r\n\r\n"I will come, to be sure," said Maria, smiling.  "And now, while there\r\nis any twilight left, go and give Mr Enderby the walk in the shrubbery\r\nthat he galloped home for."\r\n\r\nMargaret kept Philip waiting while she lighted her friend\'s lamp; and\r\nits gleam shone from the window of the summer-house for long, while,\r\ntalking of Maria, the lovers paced the shrubbery, and let the twilight\r\ngo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Deerbrook, by Harriet Martineau\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK DEERBROOK ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 24210.txt or 24210.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/4/2/1/24210/\r\n\r\nProduced by Nick Hodson of London, England\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
