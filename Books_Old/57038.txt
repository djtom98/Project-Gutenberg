It will be doubly\r\ninteresting to English readers, because for them it forms a missing\r\nlink in the famous Rougon-Macquart series.\r\n\r\nThe student of Zola literature will remember in the _Assommoir_ that\r\n"handsome Lantier whose heartlessness was to cost Gervaise so many\r\ntears." Jacques Lantier, the chief character in this _B\xc3\xaate Humaine_,\r\nthis _Human Animal_ which I have ventured to call the _Monomaniac_, is\r\none of their children. It is he who is the monomaniac. His monomania\r\nconsists in an irresistible prurience for murder, and his victims\r\nmust be women, just like that baneful criminal who was performing his\r\nhideous exploits in the streets of the city of London in utter defiance\r\nof the police, about the time M. Zola sat down to pen this remarkable\r\nnovel, and from whom, maybe, he partly took the idea.\r\n\r\nEvery woman this Jacques Lantier falls in love with, nay, every girl\r\nfrom whom he culls a kiss, or whose bare shoulders or throat he happens\r\nto catch a glimpse of, he feels an indomitable craving to slaughter!\r\nAnd this abominable thirst is, it appears, nothing less than an\r\nirresistible desire to avenge certain wrongs of which he has lost the\r\nexact account, that have been handed down to him, through the males of\r\nhis line, since that distant age when prehistoric man found shelter in\r\nthe depths of caverns.\r\n\r\nAround this peculiar being, who in other respects is like any ordinary\r\nmortal, M. \xc3\x89mile Zola has grouped some very carefully studied\r\ncharacters. All are drawn with a firm, masterly hand; all live and\r\nbreathe. Madame Lebleu, caught with her ear to the keyhole, is worthy\r\nof Dickens. So is Aunt Phasie, who has engaged in a desperate underhand\r\nstruggle with her wretch of a husband about a miserable hoard of \xc2\xa340\r\nwhich he wants to lay hands on. The idea of the jeering smile on her\r\nlips, which seem to be repeating to him, "Search! search!" as she lies\r\na corpse on her bed in the dim light of a tallow candle, is inimitable.\r\n\r\nThe unconscious S\xc3\xa9verine is but one of thousands of pretty Frenchwomen\r\ntripping along the asphalt at this hour, utterly unable to distinguish\r\nbetween right and wrong, who are ready to do anything, to sell\r\nthemselves body and soul for a little ease, a few smart frocks, and\r\nsome dainty linen. The warrior girl Flore, who thrashes the males, is a\r\ngrand conception.\r\n\r\nBut the gem of the whole bunch is that obstinate, narrow-minded,\r\nself-sufficient examining-magistrate, M. Denizet; and in dealing with\r\nthis character, the author lays bare all the abominable system of\r\nFrench criminal procedure. Recently this was modified to the extent\r\nof allowing the accused party to have the assistance of counsel while\r\nundergoing the torture of repeated searching cross-examinations at\r\nthe hands of his tormentor. But in the days of which M. \xc3\x89mile Zola is\r\nwriting, the prisoner enjoyed no such protection. He stood alone in the\r\nroom with the examining-magistrate and his registrar, and while the\r\nformer craftily laid traps for him to fall into, the latter carefully\r\ntook down his replies to the incriminating questions addressed to him.\r\nIt positively makes one shudder to think how many innocent men must\r\nhave been sent to the guillotine, or to penal servitude for life,\r\nlike poor Cabuche, during the length of years this atrocious practice\r\nremained in full vigour!\r\n\r\nThe English reader, accustomed to open, even-handed justice for one and\r\nall alike, and unfamiliar with the ways that prevail in France, will\r\nstart with amazement and incredulity at the idea of shelving criminal\r\ncases to avoid scandal involving persons in high position. But such is\r\nby no means an uncommon proceeding on the other side of the straits.\r\nGeorges Ohnet introduces a similar incident into his novel _Le Droit de\r\nl\'Enfant_.\r\n\r\nM. \xc3\x89mile Zola has made most of his books a study of some particular\r\nsphere of life in France. In this instance he introduces his readers\r\nto the railway and railway servants. They are all there, from the\r\nstation-master to the porter, and all are depicted with so skilful a\r\nhand that anyone who has travelled among our neighbours must recognise\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nBy frequent runs on an express engine between Paris and Havre, and\r\nvice vers\xc3\xa2, the author has mastered all the complicated mechanism of\r\nthe locomotive; and we see his trains vividly as in reality, starting\r\nfrom the termini, gliding along the lofty embankments, through the\r\ndeep cuttings, plunging into and bursting from the tunnels amidst the\r\ndeafening riot of their hundred wheels, while the dumpy habitation of\r\nthe gatekeeper, Misard, totters on its frail foundations as they fly by\r\nin a hurricane blast.\r\n\r\nThe story teems with incident from start to finish. Each chapter is a\r\ndrama in itself. To name but a few of the exciting events that are\r\ndealt with: there is a murder in a railway carriage; an appalling\r\nrailway accident; a desperate fight between driver and fireman on the\r\nfoot-plate of a locomotive, which ends in both going over the side\r\nto be cut to pieces, while the long train of cattle-trucks, under no\r\ncontrol, crammed full of inebriated soldiers on their way to the war,\r\nwho are yelling patriotic songs, dashes along, full steam, straight\r\nahead, with a big fire just made up, onward; to stop, no one knows\r\nwhere.\r\n\r\nThis is certainly one of the best and most dramatic novels that M.\r\n\xc3\x89mile Zola has ever penned; and I feel lively pleasure at having\r\nthe good fortune to be able, with the assistance of my enterprising\r\npublishers, to present it to the English reading public.\r\n\r\n   EDWARD VIZETELLY.\r\n\r\n    SURBITON,\r\n    _August_ 20, 1901.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MONOMANIAC\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\n\r\nRoubaud, on entering the room, placed the loaf, the p\xc3\xa2t\xc3\xa9, and the\r\nbottle of white wine on the table. But Mother Victoire, before going\r\ndown to her post in the morning, had crammed the stove with such a\r\nquantity of cinders that the heat was stifling, and the assistant\r\nstation-master, having opened a window, leant out on the rail in front\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nThis occurred in the Impasse d\'Amsterdam, in the last house on the\r\nright, a lofty dwelling, where the Western Railway Company lodged some\r\nof their staff. The window on the fifth floor, at the angle of the\r\nmansarded roof, looked on to the station, that broad trench cutting\r\ninto the Quartier de l\'Europe, to abruptly open up the view, and which\r\nthe grey mid-February sky, of a grey that was damp and warm, penetrated\r\nby the sun, seemed to make still wider on that particular afternoon.\r\n\r\nOpposite, in the sunny haze, the houses in the Rue de Rome became\r\nconfused, fading lightly into distance. On the left gaped the gigantic\r\nporches of the iron marquees, with their smoky glass. That of the main\r\nlines on which the eye looked down, appeared immense. It was separated\r\nfrom those of Argenteuil, Versailles, and the Ceinture railway, which\r\nwere smaller, by the buildings set apart for the post-office, and for\r\nheating water to fill the foot-warmers. To the right the trench was\r\nsevered by the diamond pattern ironwork of the Pont de l\'Europe, but it\r\ncame into sight again, and could be followed as far as the Batignolles\r\ntunnel.\r\n\r\nAnd below the window itself, occupying all the vast space, the three\r\ndouble lines that issued from the bridge deviated, spreading out like\r\na fan, whose innumerable metal branches ran on to disappear beneath\r\nthe span roofs of the marquees. In front of the arches stood the three\r\nboxes of the pointsmen, with their small, bare gardens. Amidst the\r\nconfused background of carriages and engines encumbering the rails, a\r\ngreat red signal formed a spot in the pale daylight.\r\n\r\nRoubaud was interested for a few minutes, comparing what he saw with\r\nhis own station at Havre. Each time he came like this, to pass a day at\r\nParis, and found accommodation in the room of Mother Victoire, love of\r\nhis trade got the better of him. The arrival of the train from Mantes\r\nhad animated the platforms under the marquee of the main lines; and his\r\neyes followed the shunting engine, a small tender-engine with three\r\nlow wheels coupled together, which began briskly bustling to and fro,\r\nbranching off the train, dragging away the carriages to drive them on\r\nto the shunting lines. Another engine, a powerful one this, an express\r\nengine, with two great devouring wheels, stood still alone, sending\r\nfrom its chimney a quantity of black smoke, which ascended straight,\r\nand very slowly, through the calm air.\r\n\r\nBut all the attention of Roubaud was centred on the 3.25 train for\r\nCaen, already full of passengers and awaiting its locomotive, which\r\nhe could not see, for it had stopped on the other side of the Pont de\r\nl\'Europe. He could only hear it asking for permission to advance, with\r\nslight, hurried whistles, like a person becoming impatient. An order\r\nresounded. The locomotive responded by one short whistle to indicate\r\nthat it had understood. Then, before moving, came a brief silence. The\r\nexhaust pipes were opened, and the steam went hissing on a level with\r\nthe ground in a deafening jet.\r\n\r\nHe then noticed this white cloud bursting from the bridge in volume,\r\nwhirling about like snowy fleece flying through the ironwork. A whole\r\ncorner of the expanse became whitened, while the smoke from the other\r\nengine expanded its black veil. From behind the bridge could be heard\r\nthe prolonged, muffled sounds of the horn, mingled with the shouting of\r\norders and the shocks of turning-tables. All at once the air was rent,\r\nand he distinguished in the background a train from Versailles, and a\r\ntrain from Auteuil, one up and one down, crossing each other.\r\n\r\nAs Roubaud was about to quit the window, a voice calling him by name\r\nmade him lean out. Below, on the fourth floor balcony, he recognised\r\na young man about thirty years of age, named Henri Dauvergne, a\r\nheadguard, who resided there with his father, deputy station-master for\r\nthe main lines, and his two sisters, Claire and Sophie, a couple of\r\ncharming blondes, one eighteen and the other twenty, who looked after\r\nthe housekeeping with the 6,000 frcs. of the two men, amidst a constant\r\nstream of gaiety. The elder one would be heard laughing, while the\r\nyounger sang, and a cage full of exotic birds rivalled one another in\r\nroulades.\r\n\r\n"By Jove, Monsieur Roubaud! so you are in Paris, then? Ah! yes, about\r\nyour affair with the sub-prefect!"\r\n\r\nThe assistant station-master, leaning on the rail again, explained\r\nthat he had to leave Havre that morning by the 6.40 express. He had\r\nbeen summoned to Paris by the traffic-manager, who had been giving him\r\na serious lecture. He considered himself lucky in not having lost his\r\npost.\r\n\r\n"And madam?" Henri inquired.\r\n\r\nMadame had wished to come also, to make some purchases. Her husband was\r\nwaiting for her there, in that room which Mother Victoire placed at\r\ntheir service whenever they came to Paris. It was there that they loved\r\nto lunch, tranquil and alone, while the worthy woman was detained\r\ndownstairs at her post. On that particular day they had eaten a roll\r\nat Mantes, wishing to get their errands over first of all. But three\r\no\'clock had struck, and he was dying with hunger.\r\n\r\nHenri, to be amiable, put one more question:\r\n\r\n"And are you going to pass the night in Paris?"\r\n\r\nNo, no! Both were returning to Havre in the evening by the 6.30\r\nexpress. Ah! holidays, indeed! They brought you up to give you your\r\ndose, and off, back again at once!\r\n\r\nThe two looked at one another for a moment, tossing their heads, but\r\nthey could no longer hear themselves speak; a devil-possessed piano\r\nhad just broken into sonorous notes. The two sisters must have been\r\nthumping on it together, laughing louder than ever, and exciting the\r\nexotic birds. Then the young man gained by the merriment, said good-bye\r\nto withdraw into the apartment; and the assistant station-master,\r\nleft alone, remained a moment with his eyes on the balcony whence\r\nascended all this youthful gaiety. Then, looking up, he perceived the\r\nlocomotive, whose driver had shut off the exhaust pipes and which the\r\npointsman switched on to the train for Caen. The last flakes of white\r\nsteam were lost amid the heavy whirling cloud of smoke soiling the sky.\r\nAnd Roubaud also returned into his room.\r\n\r\nStanding before the cuckoo clock pointing to 3.20, he gave a gesture\r\nof despair. What on earth was keeping S\xc3\xa9verine so long? When she\r\nonce entered a shop, she could never leave it. To stay his famishing\r\nhunger he thought of laying the table. He was familiar with this\r\nlarge apartment lighted by two windows, which served as bedroom,\r\ndining-room, and kitchen; and with its walnut furniture, its bed draped\r\nin Turkey-red material, its sideboard, its round table, and Norman\r\nwardrobe.\r\n\r\nFrom the sideboard he took napkins, plates, knives and forks, and two\r\nglasses. Everything was extremely clean, and he felt as much pleased to\r\nperform this little household duty, as if he had been a child playing\r\nat dining. The whiteness of the linen delighted him, and, being very\r\nmuch in love with his wife, he smiled to himself at the idea of the\r\npeal of laughter she would give on opening the door. But when he had\r\nplaced the p\xc3\xa2t\xc3\xa9 on a plate, and set the bottle of white wine beside it,\r\nhe became uneasy and looked about him. Then he quickly drew a couple of\r\nsmall parcels from his pockets which he had forgotten--a little box of\r\nsardines and some Gruy\xc3\xa8re cheese.\r\n\r\nThe half hour struck. Roubaud strode up and down with an ear attentive\r\nto the staircase, turning round at the least sound. Passing before the\r\nlooking-glass as he waited with nothing to do, he stopped and gazed at\r\nhimself. He did not appear to be growing old. Although getting on for\r\nforty, the bright reddishness of his curly hair had not diminished.\r\nHis fair beard, also verging on red, which he wore full, had remained\r\nthick. Of medium height, but extremely vigorous, he felt pleased with\r\nhis appearance, satisfied with his rather flat head, and low forehead,\r\nhis thick neck, his round, ruddy face lit up by a pair of large,\r\nsparkling eyes. His eyebrows joined, clouding his forehead with the bar\r\nof jealousy.\r\n\r\nThere was a sound of footsteps. Roubaud ran and set the door ajar;\r\nbut it was a woman who sold newspapers in the station, returning to\r\nher lodging hard by. He came back and examined a box made of shells\r\nstanding on the sideboard. He knew that box very well, a present from\r\nS\xc3\xa9verine to Mother Victoire, her wet-nurse. And this trifling object\r\nsufficed to recall all the story of his marriage, which had taken place\r\nalmost three years previously.\r\n\r\nBorn in the south of France at Plassans, he had a carter for father. He\r\nhad quitted the army with the stripes of a sergeant-major, and for a\r\nlong time had been general porter at the station at Mantes. He had then\r\nbeen promoted head-porter at Barentin, and it was there that he had\r\nfirst seen his dear wife, when she came from Doinville in company with\r\nMademoiselle Berthe, the daughter of President Grandmorin.\r\n\r\nS\xc3\xa9verine Aubry was nothing more than the younger daughter of a\r\ngardener, who had died in the service of the Grandmorins; but the\r\nPresident, her godfather and guardian, had taken such a fancy to her,\r\nmaking her the playmate of his own daughter, sending them both to the\r\nsame school at Rouen, and, moreover, she possessed such an innate air\r\nof superiority herself, that Roubaud for a long time, had been content\r\nto admire her at a distance, with the passion of a workman freed from\r\nsome of his rough edge, for a dainty jewel that he considered precious.\r\n\r\nThis was the sole romance of his existence. He would have wedded the\r\ngirl without a sou, for the joy of calling her his own; and when he\r\nhad been so bold as to ask her hand, the realisation of his hopes\r\nhad surpassed his dream. Apart from S\xc3\xa9verine and a marriage portion\r\nof 10,000 frcs., the President, now pensioned off, a member of the\r\nBoard of Directors of the Western Railway Company, had extended to him\r\nhis protection. Almost immediately after the wedding he had become\r\nassistant station-master at Havre. No doubt he had good notes to his\r\ncredit--firm at his post, punctual, honest, of limited intelligence,\r\nbut very straightforward,--all excellent qualities that might explain\r\nthe prompt attention given to his request and his rapid promotion. But\r\nhe preferred to believe that he owed everything to his wife whom he\r\nadored.\r\n\r\nWhen Roubaud had opened the box of sardines he positively lost\r\npatience. It had been agreed that they should meet there at three\r\no\'clock. Where could she be? She would not have the audacity to tell\r\nhim that it required a whole day to purchase a pair of boots, and a few\r\narticles of linen. And as he again passed before the looking-glass, he\r\nperceived his eyebrows on end, and his forehead furrowed with a harsh\r\nline. Never had he suspected her at Havre. In Paris he pictured to\r\nhimself all sorts of danger, deceit, and levity. The blood rushed to\r\nhis head, his fists of a former porter were clenched, as in the days\r\nwhen he shunted the carriages. He became the brute again, unconscious\r\nof his strength. He would have crushed her in an outburst of blind fury.\r\n\r\nS\xc3\xa9verine pushed open the door, and presented herself quite fresh and\r\njoyful.\r\n\r\n"Here I am! Eh! you must have fancied me lost," she exclaimed.\r\n\r\nIn the lustre of her five-and-twenty years she looked tall, slim, and\r\nvery supple, but she was plump, notwithstanding her small bones. At\r\nfirst sight she did not appear pretty, with her long face, and large\r\nmouth set with beautiful teeth. But on observing her more closely,\r\nshe fascinated one by her charm, by the peculiarity of her blue eyes,\r\ncrowned with an abundance of raven hair.\r\n\r\nAnd as her husband, without answering, continued to examine her with\r\nthe troubled, vacillating look she knew so well, she added:\r\n\r\n"Oh! I walked very fast. Just imagine, it was impossible to get an\r\nomnibus. Then, as I did not want to spend money on a cab, I walked as\r\nfast as I could. See how hot I am!"\r\n\r\n"Look here," said he violently, "you will not make me believe you come\r\nfrom the Bon March\xc3\xa9."\r\n\r\nBut immediately, in the delightful manner of a child, she threw herself\r\non his neck, closing his mouth with her pretty little plump hand.\r\n\r\n"Oh! you wicked creature! you wicked creature!" she exclaimed; "hold\r\nyour tongue; you know I love you."\r\n\r\nShe was so full of sincerity, he felt her still so candid, so\r\nstraightforward, that he pressed her passionately in his arms. His\r\nsuspicions always ended thus. She abandoned herself to him, loving to\r\nbe petted. He covered her with kisses, which she did not return; and\r\nit was this that caused him a sort of vague uneasiness. This great,\r\npassive child, full of filial affection, had not yet awakened to love.\r\n\r\n"So you ransacked the Bon March\xc3\xa9?" said he.\r\n\r\n"Oh! yes. I\'ll tell you all about it," she replied. "But, first of all,\r\nlet us eat. You cannot imagine how hungry I am! Ah! listen! I\'ve a\r\nlittle present. Repeat, \'Where is my little present?\'"\r\n\r\nAnd she laughed quite close to his face. She had thrust her right hand\r\nin her pocket, where she held an object she did not take out of it.\r\n\r\n"Say quick, \'Where is my little present?\'" she continued.\r\n\r\nHe also was laughing, like a good-natured man, and did as she asked him.\r\n\r\n"Where is my little present?" he inquired. She had bought him a knife\r\nto replace one he had lost, and which he had been regretting for the\r\npast fortnight. He uttered an exclamation of delight, pronouncing this\r\nbeautiful new knife superb, with its ivory handle and shining blade. He\r\nwanted to use it at once. She was charmed at his joy, and, in fun, made\r\nhim give her a sou, so that their friendship might not be severed.\r\n\r\n"To lunch, to lunch!" she repeated. "No, no!" she exclaimed, as he was\r\nabout to shut the window; "don\'t close it yet, I beg of you! I am too\r\nwarm!"\r\n\r\nShe joined him at the window, and remained there a few seconds, leaning\r\non his shoulder, gazing at the vast expanse of the station. For the\r\nmoment the smoke had disappeared. The copper-coloured disc of the\r\nsun descended in the haze behind the houses in the Rue de Rome. At\r\ntheir feet a shunting engine was bringing along the Mantes train, all\r\nmade up, which was to leave at 4.25. The engine drove it back beside\r\nthe platform under the marquee, and was unhooked. In the background,\r\nbeneath the span-roof of the Ceinture line, the shocks of buffers\r\nannounced the unforeseen coupling-on of extra carriages. And alone, in\r\nthe middle of the network of rails, with driver and fireman blackened\r\nwith the dust of the journey, the heavy engine of some slow train stood\r\nmotionless, as if weary and breathless, with merely a thin thread of\r\nsteam issuing from a valve. It was waiting for the line to be opened to\r\nreturn to the dep\xc3\xb4t at Batignolles. A red signal clacked, disappeared,\r\nand the locomotive went off.\r\n\r\n"How gay those little Dauvergnes are!" remarked Roubaud. "Do you hear\r\nthem thumping on their piano? I saw Henri just now, and he asked me to\r\ngive you his compliments."\r\n\r\n"To table, to table!" exclaimed S\xc3\xa9verine.\r\n\r\nAnd she fell upon the sardines with a hearty appetite, having eaten\r\nnothing since she bought the roll at Mantes. Her visits to Paris always\r\nmade her excited. She was quivering with pleasure at her run through\r\nthe streets, and still enraptured with her purchases at the Bon March\xc3\xa9.\r\nEach spring she spent all her winter savings at one stroke, preferring\r\nto purchase everything at the capital, and thus economise the cost of\r\nthe journey, as she said. Without losing a mouthful, she never paused\r\nin her chatter. A trifle confused, and blushing, she ended by letting\r\nout the total of the sum she had spent, more than 300 frcs.\r\n\r\n"The deuce!" remarked Roubaud, startled; "you get yourself up well for\r\nthe wife of an assistant station-master! But I thought you were only\r\ngoing to buy a little linen and a pair of boots."\r\n\r\n"Oh! my dear! but I have got such bargains. A piece of silk with such\r\nlovely stripes! A hat, in exquisite taste, something to dream of!\r\nReady-made petticoats with embroidered flounces! And all this for next\r\nto nothing. I should have paid double at Havre. They are going to send\r\nthe parcel, and you\'ll see!"\r\n\r\nShe looked so pretty in her delight, with her confused air of\r\nsupplication, that he resolved to laugh. And besides, this little\r\nscratch dinner was so charming in this room where they were all alone,\r\nand much more comfortable than at a restaurant. She, who usually\r\ndrank water, threw off restraint, and swallowed her glass of white\r\nwine without knowing what she was about. The box of sardines being\r\nempty, they attacked the p\xc3\xa2t\xc3\xa9 with the beautiful new knife. It cut so\r\nadmirably that it was a perfect triumph.\r\n\r\n"And you--what about your affair?" she inquired. "You make me chatter,\r\nand you don\'t tell me how your matter with the sub-prefect ended."\r\n\r\nThereupon he related in detail how he had been treated by the\r\ntraffic-manager. Oh! he had received a thorough good wigging! He had\r\ndefended himself, he had told the truth. He had related how this\r\nlittle whipper-snapper of a sub-prefect had insisted on getting into\r\na first-class carriage with his dog, when there was a second-class\r\ncarriage reserved for sportsmen and their animals, and had given an\r\naccount of the quarrel that had resulted, and the words that had\r\nbeen exchanged. In short, the manager had said he was right to have\r\ninsisted on the regulations being complied with; but the bad part of\r\nthe business was that sentence which he confessed having uttered: "You\r\nothers will not always be the masters!" He was suspected of being a\r\nrepublican. The discussions that had just marked the opening of the\r\nsession of 1869, and the secret alarm about the forthcoming elections,\r\nhad made the government distrustful. And had not President Grandmorin\r\nspoken warmly in his favour, he would certainly have been removed\r\nfrom his post. As it was, he had been compelled to sign the letter of\r\napology which the latter had advised should be sent, and had drawn up\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n"Ah! you see!" broke in S\xc3\xa9verine. "Wasn\'t I right to drop him a line,\r\nand pay him a visit along with you, this morning, before you went to\r\nreceive your wigging? I knew he would get us out of the trouble."\r\n\r\n"Yes, he is very fond of you," resumed Roubaud, "and is all powerful\r\nin the company. What is the use of being a good servant? Ah! the\r\nmanager did not stint me of praise: slow to take the initiative, but of\r\ngood conduct, obedient, courageous, briefly, all sorts of qualities!\r\nWell, my dear, if you had not been my wife, and if Grandmorin had not\r\npleaded my cause out of friendship for you, it would have been all up\r\nwith me. I should have been sent to do penance at some small station."\r\n\r\nShe was staring fixedly into space, and murmured, as if speaking to\r\nherself:\r\n\r\n"Oh! certainly, he is a man with great influence."\r\n\r\nThere was a silence, and she sat with her eyes wide open and lost in\r\nthought. She had ceased eating. No doubt she was thinking of the days\r\nof her childhood, far away, at the Ch\xc3\xa2teau of Doinville, four leagues\r\nfrom Rouen. She had never known her mother. When her father, the\r\ngardener Aubry died, she was commencing her thirteenth year; and it\r\nwas at this period that the President, already a widower, had placed\r\nher with his daughter Berthe in charge of his sister, Madame Bonnehon,\r\nherself the widow of a manufacturer, from whom she had inherited the\r\nch\xc3\xa2teau.\r\n\r\nBerthe, who was two years older than S\xc3\xa9verine, had been wedded six\r\nmonths after the marriage of the latter with Roubaud, to M. de\r\nLachesnaye, a little, shrivelled-up, sallow-complexioned man, judge at\r\nthe Rouen Court of Appeal. In the preceding year President Grandmorin\r\nwas still at the head of this court at Rouen, which was his own part of\r\nthe country, when he retired on a pension, after a brilliant career.\r\n\r\nBorn in 1804, substitute at Digne on the morrow of the events in 1830,\r\nthen at Fontainebleau, then at Paris, he had afterwards filled the\r\nposts of procurator at Troyes; advocate-general at Rennes; and finally,\r\nfirst president at Rouen. A multi-millionaire, he had been member of\r\nthe County Council since 1855, and on the same day as he retired, he\r\nhad been made Commander of the Legion of Honour. As far back as she\r\ncould recollect, she remembered him just as he was now--thick-set and\r\nstrong, prematurely grey, but the golden grey of one formerly fair;\r\nhis hair cut Brutus fashion, his beard clipped short, no moustache, a\r\nsquare face, which eyes of a hard blue and a big nose rendered severe.\r\nHe was harsh on being approached, and made everyone about him tremble.\r\n\r\nS\xc3\xa9verine was so absorbed that Roubaud had to raise his voice, repeating\r\ntwice over:\r\n\r\n"Well, what are you thinking about?"\r\n\r\nShe started, gave a little shudder, as if surprised, and trembled with\r\nalarm.\r\n\r\n"Oh! of nothing!" she answered.\r\n\r\n"But you are not eating. Have you lost your appetite?" he inquired.\r\n\r\n"Oh! no; you\'ll see," she replied.\r\n\r\nS\xc3\xa9verine, having emptied her glass of white wine, finished the slice\r\nof p\xc3\xa2t\xc3\xa9 on her plate. But there was a cry of alarm. They had eaten the\r\nsmall loaf; not a mouthful remained for the cheese. They clamoured,\r\nthen laughed, and finally, after disturbing everything, found a piece\r\nof stale bread at the back of the sideboard cupboard of Mother Victoire.\r\n\r\nAlthough the window was open, it continued very warm, and the young\r\nwoman, seated with her back to the stove, could not get refreshed; and\r\nshe had become more rosy and excited, by the unforeseen talkative lunch\r\nin this room.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Mother Victoire, Roubaud had returned to Grandmorin; there\r\nwas another who owed him a famous debt of gratitude. The mother of a\r\nchild who had died, she became wet-nurse to S\xc3\xa9verine, whose birth had\r\nsent her mamma into the grave. Later on, as wife of a fireman of the\r\ncompany, who spent all he earned in drink, she was leading a wretched\r\nexistence in Paris by the aid of a little sewing, when, happening to\r\nmeet her foster-daughter, the former intimacy had been renewed, while\r\nthe President, at the same time, took her under his protection. He had\r\nnow obtained for her the post of attendant at the lavatory for ladies.\r\nThe company gave her no more than 100 frcs., but she made nearly\r\n1,400 frcs. out of the gratuities, without counting the lodging, this\r\nroom where they were lunching, and her coals. Indeed, she had a most\r\ncomfortable post. And Roubaud calculated that if Pecqueux, the husband,\r\nhad brought home the 2,800 frcs. which he earned as fireman, wages and\r\ngratuities together, instead of running riot at both ends of the line,\r\nthey would have had between them more than 4,000 frcs. a year, double\r\nwhat he received as assistant station-master at Havre.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, their sharp hunger had become appeased, and they\r\ndawdled over the rest of the meal, cutting the cheese into small pieces\r\nto make the feast last longer. Conversation also flagged.\r\n\r\n"By the way," said he, "why did you decline the invitation of the\r\nPresident to go to Doinville for two or three days?"\r\n\r\nIn the comfort of a good digestion, he had just been running over in\r\nhis mind, the incidents of their visit in the morning to the mansion\r\nin the Rue du Rocher, quite close to the station; he had seen himself\r\nagain in the large, stern study, and he again heard the President\r\ntelling them that he was leaving on the morrow for Doinville. Then, as\r\nif acting on a sudden impulse, the latter had suggested taking the 6.30\r\nexpress with them that evening, and conducting his god-daughter on a\r\nvisit to his sister, who had been wanting to see her for a long time.\r\nBut the young woman had given all kinds of reasons which prevented her,\r\nshe said, from accepting the invitation.\r\n\r\n"For my part," he remarked, "I saw no inconvenience in this little\r\ntrip. You might have remained there till Thursday. I should have\r\nbeen able to manage without you; don\'t you think so? We have need\r\nof them in our position. It is rather silly to show indifference to\r\ntheir politeness, and the more so as your refusal seemed to cause him\r\nreal pain. And that was why I never ceased pressing you to accept,\r\nuntil you tugged at my coat; and then I spoke as you did, but without\r\nunderstanding what it meant. Eh! why wouldn\'t you go?"\r\n\r\nS\xc3\xa9verine, with restless eyes, gave a gesture of impatience.\r\n\r\n"How could I leave you all alone?" she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n"That isn\'t a reason," he replied. "During the three years we have been\r\nmarried, you have paid two visits of a week to Doinville. There was\r\nnothing to prevent you going there a third time."\r\n\r\nThe young woman, more and more uneasy, turned away her head.\r\n\r\n"Well, I didn\'t care about it," said she. "You don\'t want to force me\r\nto do things that displease me."\r\n\r\nRoubaud opened his arms, as if to say that he had no intention of\r\nforcing her to do anything. Nevertheless, he resumed:\r\n\r\n"Look here, you are hiding something. Did Madame Bonnehon receive you\r\nbadly the last time you went there?"\r\n\r\nOh! no; Madame Bonnehon had always welcomed her with great kindness,\r\nshe was so amiable. Tall, and well developed, with magnificent light\r\nhair, she still remained beautiful, notwithstanding her fifty-five\r\nyears. Gossip had it that since her widowhood, and even during the\r\nlifetime of her husband, her heart had frequently been occupied. They\r\nadored her at Doinville, where she made the ch\xc3\xa2teau a perfect paradise.\r\nAll Rouen society visited there, particularly the magistracy; and it\r\nwas among this body that Madame Bonnehon had met with a great many\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\n"Then own that it was the Lachesnayes who gave you the cold shoulder,"\r\ncontinued Roubaud.\r\n\r\nIt was true that since Berthe had married M. de Lachesnaye, she had not\r\nbeen on the same terms with S\xc3\xa9verine as before. This poor Berthe, who\r\nlooked so insignificant with her red nose, was certainly not improving\r\nin character. The ladies at Rouen extolled her noble bearing in no mean\r\nmeasure. But a husband such as she had, ugly, harsh, and miserly,\r\nseemed likely to communicate his bad qualities to his wife, and make\r\nher ill-natured. Still, S\xc3\xa9verine had nothing in particular to reproach\r\nher with. Berthe had been agreeable to her former companion.\r\n\r\n"Then it\'s the President who displeases you down there," remarked\r\nRoubaud.\r\n\r\nS\xc3\xa9verine, who had been answering slowly and in an even tone, became\r\nimpatient again.\r\n\r\n"He! What an idea!" she exclaimed.\r\n\r\nAnd she continued in short, nervous phrases. They barely caught sight\r\nof him. He had reserved to himself a pavilion in the park, having\r\na door opening on a deserted lane. He went out and came in without\r\nanybody knowing anything about his movements. His sister never even\r\nknew positively on what day he arrived. He took a vehicle at Barentin,\r\nand drove over by night to Doinville, where he remained for days\r\ntogether in his pavilion, ignored by everyone. Ah! it was not he who\r\ntroubled them down there.\r\n\r\n"I only mention it," said Roubaud, "because you have told me, over\r\nand over again, that in your childhood, he frightened you out of your\r\nsenses."\r\n\r\n"Oh! frightened me out of my senses!" she replied. "You exaggerate, as\r\nusual. It is a fact that he rarely laughed. He stared at you so with\r\nhis great eyes, that he made you hang your head at once. I have seen\r\npersons confused, to the point of being unable to say a word to him,\r\nso deeply were they impressed by his great reputation for severity and\r\nwisdom. But as for me, I was never scolded by him. I always felt he had\r\na weakness for me."\r\n\r\nOnce more her speech became slow, and her eyes were lost in space.\r\n\r\n"I remember," she resumed, "when I was a little girl, and happened to\r\nbe having a game with playmates on the paths, that if he chanced to\r\nappear, everyone ran into hiding, even his daughter Berthe, who was\r\nalways trembling with fear lest she should be caught doing something\r\nwrong. For my part, I calmly awaited him. He came along, and seeing me\r\nthere, smiling and looking up, gave me a pat on the cheek. Later on,\r\nat sixteen, whenever Berthe wished to obtain some favour from him, she\r\nalways entrusted me with the mission of asking it. I spoke. I never\r\nlooked down, and I felt his eyes penetrating me. But I did not care\r\na fig, I was so sure he would grant whatever I wanted. Ah! yes; I\r\nremember it all. There is not a piece of brushwood in the park, not a\r\ncorridor, nor a room in the ch\xc3\xa2teau that I cannot see, when I close my\r\neyes."\r\n\r\nShe ceased speaking, and lowered her lids. The thrill of incidents of\r\nformer days seemed to pass over her warm, puffy face. She remained thus\r\nfor a few moments, with a slight beating of the lips, something like a\r\nnervous twitch, that drew down the corner of her mouth as if she were\r\nin pain.\r\n\r\n"He has certainly been very good to you," said Roubaud, who had just\r\nlit his pipe. "Not only did he bring you up like a young lady, but he\r\nvery shrewdly invested the little money you had, and increased it when\r\nwe were married, without counting what he is going to leave you. He\r\nsaid in my presence that he had mentioned you in his will."\r\n\r\n"Ah! yes!" murmured S\xc3\xa9verine, "that house at La Croix-de-Maufras, the\r\nproperty the railway cut in two. We used to go there, occasionally, for\r\na week. Oh! I don\'t much count on that. The Lachesnayes must be at work\r\nto prevent him leaving me anything. And, besides, I would rather have\r\nnothing--nothing at all!"\r\n\r\nShe had uttered these last words in such a sharp tone, that he was\r\nastonished, and, taking his pipe from his mouth, he stared at her with\r\nrounded eyes.\r\n\r\n"How funny you are!" said he. "Everyone knows that the President\r\nis worth millions. What harm would there be in him putting his\r\ngod-daughter in his will? No one would be surprised, and it would be\r\nall right for us."\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'ve had enough of the subject," answered S\xc3\xa9verine; "let us talk\r\nabout something else. I will not go to Doinville because I will not,\r\nbecause I prefer to return with you to Havre."\r\n\r\nHe tossed his head, and appeased her with a motion of the hand. Very\r\ngood, very good! As the subject annoyed her, he would say no more about\r\nit. He smiled. Never had he seen her so nervous. No doubt it was the\r\nwhite wine. Anxious to be forgiven, he took up the knife, went into\r\nanother fit of ecstasy about it, and carefully wiped the blade. To show\r\nthat it cut like a razor, he began to trim his nails with it.\r\n\r\n"Already a quarter past four," murmured S\xc3\xa9verine, standing before the\r\ncuckoo clock. "I have a few more errands to do. We must think about our\r\ntrain."\r\n\r\nBut, as if to get quite calm before making the room tidy, she went to\r\nthe window and leant out of it. Then he, leaving his knife, leaving his\r\npipe, also rose from the table, and, approaching her, took her gently\r\nfrom behind in his arms; and holding her enlaced, placed his chin on\r\nher shoulder, pressing his head against her own. Neither moved, but\r\nremained gazing at the scene below them.\r\n\r\nThe small shunting engines went and came without intermission. Similar\r\nto sharp and prudent housewives, the activity of their movements\r\ncould barely be heard as they glided along with muffled wheels and\r\na discreet whistle. One of them ran past, and disappeared under the\r\nPont de l\'Europe, dragging the carriages of a Trouville train to the\r\ncoach-house. Over there, beyond the bridge, it brushed by a locomotive\r\nthat had come alone from the dep\xc3\xb4t, like a solitary pedestrian, with\r\nits shimmering brass and steel, fresh and smart for the journey. This\r\nengine was standing still, and with a couple of short whistles appealed\r\nto the pointsman to open the line. Almost immediately he switched it on\r\nto its train, which stood ready made up, beside the platform, under the\r\nmarquee of the main lines.\r\n\r\nThis was the 4.25 train for Dieppe. A stream of passengers hurried\r\nforward. One heard the roll of the trucks loaded with luggage, and the\r\nporters pushing the foot-warmers, one by one, into the compartments.\r\nThe engine and tender had reached the first luggage van with a\r\nhollow clash, and the head-porter could then be seen tightening the\r\nscrew of the spreader. The sky had become cloudy in the direction of\r\nBatignolles. An ashen crepuscule, effacing the fa\xc3\xa7ades, seemed to be\r\nalready falling on the outspread fan of railway lines; and, in this dim\r\nlight, one saw in the distance, the constant departure and arrival of\r\ntrains on the Banlieue and Ceinture lines. Beyond the great sheet of\r\nspan-roofing of the station, shreds of reddish smoke flew over darkened\r\nParis.\r\n\r\nS\xc3\xa9verine and Roubaud had remained some minutes at the open window\r\nwithout speaking. He had taken her left hand, and was playing with an\r\nold gold ring, a golden serpent with a small ruby head, which she wore\r\non the same finger as her wedding-ring. He had always seen it there.\r\n\r\n"My little serpent," she murmured, in an involuntary dreamy voice,\r\nthinking he was looking at the ring, and feeling an imperative\r\nnecessity to speak. "He made me a present of it at La Croix-de-Maufras\r\nwhen I was sixteen."\r\n\r\nRoubaud raised his head in surprise.\r\n\r\n"Who was that?" he inquired. "The President?"\r\n\r\nAs the eyes of her husband rested on her own, she awoke, with an abrupt\r\nshock, to a sense of reality. She felt a little chill turn her cheeks\r\nicy cold. She wished to answer, when, choked by a sort of paralysis,\r\nshe could say nothing.\r\n\r\n"But," he continued, "you always told me it was your mother who left\r\nyou that ring."\r\n\r\nEven at this second, she could have annulled the sentence she had\r\nthoughtlessly let slip. She had only to laugh, to play the madcap. But,\r\nlosing her self-command, unconscious of the gravity of what she was\r\ndoing, she obstinately maintained her statement.\r\n\r\n"I never told you, my dear," she replied, "that my mother left me that\r\nring."\r\n\r\nThereupon, Roubaud, also turning pale, stared at her threateningly.\r\n\r\n"What do you mean," he retorted, "by saying you never told me so? Why,\r\nyou\'ve told it me twenty times over! There\'s no harm in the President\r\ngiving you a ring. He has made you other presents of much greater\r\nvalue. But what need was there to hide it from me? Why lie, in speaking\r\nof your mother?"\r\n\r\n"I never mentioned my mother, my darling," she persisted. "You are\r\nmistaken."\r\n\r\nThis obstinacy was idiotic. She was aware that she was ruining herself,\r\nthat he could clearly see through her. And she then wanted to retrieve\r\nher position, to swallow her words. But it was too late. She felt her\r\nfeatures becoming discomposed. Do what she would, the truth burst from\r\nall her being. The chill on her cheeks had spread all over her face,\r\nand a nervous twitch dragged down her lip.\r\n\r\nRoubaud looked frightful. He had suddenly become red again, so red\r\nthat it seemed as if his veins were about to burst. He had grasped her\r\nby the wrists, looking close into her face so as to be better able to\r\nfollow, in the terror-stricken distraction of her eyes, what she dared\r\nnot utter aloud. He stammered a great oath, which threw her into a\r\nfright, and, foreseeing a blow, she bowed her head, covering her face\r\nwith her arm.\r\n\r\nA trifling, wretched, insignificant incident--the failure to recollect\r\nthe falsehood she had told about this ring--had just now, in the few\r\nwords they had exchanged together, supplied evidence of a matter she\r\nhad every desire to conceal. And a minute had sufficed to bring this\r\nabout.\r\n\r\nWith a jerk, he threw her across the bed, and struck her haphazard\r\nwith his two fists. In three years he had not given her so much as a\r\nflip, and now he was beating her black and blue, in the brutish fit of\r\npassion of a man with coarse hands, who had formerly shunted railway\r\ncarriages.\r\n\r\nUttering another frightful oath, he exclaimed:\r\n\r\n"You did something wrong! Something wrong! Something wrong!"\r\n\r\nAs he repeated the words, his rage increased, and he belaboured her\r\nwith his fists, each time he pronounced them, as if to drive them\r\ninto her flesh. His voice at last became so thick with anger, that it\r\nhissed, and ceased to be intelligible. It was only then that he heard\r\nher, quite weak from his blows, saying "No." She could imagine no other\r\ndefence. She denied the accusation, so that he might not kill her. And\r\nthis utterance, this obstinate clinging to the lie, made him completely\r\nfurious.\r\n\r\n"Confess that you did something wrong," said he.\r\n\r\n"No, no!" she answered.\r\n\r\nHe had caught hold of her again, supporting her in his arms, preventing\r\nher from resuming her position with her face against the bed-covering,\r\nlike some poor creature hiding herself. He forced her to look him in\r\nthe face.\r\n\r\n"Confess that you did something wrong," he repeated.\r\n\r\nBut, slipping down, she escaped, and tried to gain the door. In a\r\nbound he was upon her again, his fist raised; and furiously, at one\r\nblow, near the table, he felled her. He threw himself beside her, he\r\nseized her by the hair to nail her to the boards. For an instant they\r\nremained thus, on the ground, face to face, without moving. And in the\r\nfrightful silence, could be heard, ascending from the floor below, the\r\nsinging and laughter of the young Dauvergnes, whose piano, fortunately,\r\nfrantically poured forth its notes, stifling the sound of the struggle.\r\nIt was Claire singing nursery-rhymes, while Sophie accompanied her with\r\nall her might.\r\n\r\n"Confess that you did something wrong," said he.\r\n\r\nNo longer daring to say no, she remained silent.\r\n\r\n"Confess that you did something wrong," he exclaimed with an oath, "or\r\nI\'ll rip you open!"\r\n\r\nHe would have killed her; she could see it distinctly in his eyes.\r\nIn falling, she had perceived the knife, open on the table, and now\r\nshe fancied she saw the flash of the blade again. She thought he was\r\nextending his arm. She was overcome by cowardice, by an abandonment of\r\nherself and everything, a necessity to have done with the matter.\r\n\r\n"Well, yes," said she, "it\'s true. Let me go."\r\n\r\nWhat followed was abominable. This avowal, which he had so violently\r\nexacted, had just come upon him, point blank, like something impossible\r\nand monstrous. It seemed that he could never have imagined such an\r\ninfamy. He caught hold of her head, and knocked it against a leg of the\r\ntable. She struggled, and he dragged her across the room by the hair,\r\nscattering the chairs.\r\n\r\nEach time she made an effort to rise he knocked her back on the floor\r\nby a blow from his fist. And he did this panting, with clenched teeth,\r\nin savage and senseless fury. The table, thrust away, almost upset the\r\nstove. Blood and hair were sticking to a corner of the sideboard. When\r\nthey recovered breath, stupefied and reeking with this horror, weary of\r\nstriking and of being struck, they had got close to the bed again; she,\r\nstill stretched on the floor, he squatting down, holding her by the\r\nshoulders. And they had breathing time. Below, the music continued. The\r\nlaughter rippled away, sonorous, and very youthful.\r\n\r\nRoubaud, with a jerk, raised S\xc3\xa9verine into a sitting posture, setting\r\nher back against the bedstead. Then, still on his knees, weighing down\r\non her shoulders, he could at last speak. He had ceased beating her; he\r\ntortured her with questions. She wept. She was so upset that she could\r\nnot utter a word; and, raising his hand, he half stunned her with a\r\nblow from his palm. Three times, at intervals, receiving no answer, he\r\nslapped her face. Why should she struggle any longer? She was already\r\nhalf dead. He would have torn out her heart with those horny fingers\r\nof a former workman. And so, the cross-examination proceeded, with the\r\nthreatening fist uplifted, ready to strike if she hesitated in her\r\nreplies.\r\n\r\nAll at once he shook her, and inquired with an oath:\r\n\r\n"Why did you marry me? Don\'t you know it was infamous to deceive me in\r\nthis manner? There are thieves in prison, who have not half what you\r\nhave on their conscience. So you despised me? You were not in love with\r\nme? Eh! why did you marry me?"\r\n\r\nShe gave a vague gesture. She did not exactly know, now. She was happy\r\nto marry him, hoping to get rid of the other. There are so many things\r\none would rather not do, and which one does, because they are after\r\nall the wisest. No, she did not love him; and she carefully avoided\r\ntelling him that had it not been for this business, never would she\r\nhave consented to become his wife.\r\n\r\nS\xc3\xa9verine, by an effort, had risen to her feet. With a vigour that was\r\nextraordinary in such a weak, vanquished creature, she had thrust\r\nRoubaud from her. And as she freed her hand he felt the ring, the\r\nlittle golden serpent with the ruby head, forgotten on her finger. He\r\ntore it off, crushed it beneath his heel in another fit of rage. Then\r\nhe began striding up and down, from one end of the room to the other,\r\nmute and distracted. She sank down, seated at the edge of the bed,\r\nstaring at him with her great fixed eyes. And a terrible silence ensued.\r\n\r\nThe fury of Roubaud was not calmed. No sooner did it seem to moderate\r\na little, than it returned at once in great waves of increased\r\nvolume, which bore him along in their vertiginous flood. No longer\r\nunder self-control, he struck about in space, a victim to all the\r\ngusts of the violent tempest lacerating him, only to awaken to the\r\nimperative necessity of appeasing the howling brute within him. It\r\nwas a physical, an immediate necessity, a thirst for vengeance that\r\nwrung his body, and which would leave him no repose until it had been\r\nsatisfied.\r\n\r\nWithout stopping in his walk, he struck his temples with his two fists,\r\nand he stammered out in a voice of anguish:\r\n\r\n"What shall I do?"\r\n\r\nAs he had not killed this woman at once, he would not kill her now.\r\nHis cowardice in allowing her to live exasperated his anger, for it\r\nwas cowardly. It was because he still cared for her that he had not\r\nstrangled her. Nevertheless, he could not keep her with him, after what\r\nhe had discovered. Then he would have to drive her out, put her into\r\nthe street, never to see her again? And at this thought, a fresh flood\r\nof suffering overwhelmed him. He experienced an execrable feeling of\r\ndisgust when he recognised that he would not even do this. What then?\r\nIt only remained for him to accept the abomination, and to take this\r\nwoman back to Havre, there to continue to live quietly together, as if\r\nnothing had occurred. No, no! Death rather. Death for both of them that\r\nvery instant! He was stirred with such intense distress that his head\r\nseemed to have gone astray, and he cried out louder than before:\r\n\r\n"What shall I do?"\r\n\r\nS\xc3\xa9verine, from the bed, where she remained seated, continued following\r\nhim with her great eyes. She had always felt the calm affection of\r\na comrade for him, and the excessive grief in which she now saw him\r\nplunged, aroused her pity. The ugly words and blows she would have\r\nexcused, if this wild fit of passion had caused her less surprise--a\r\nsurprise that she had not yet got over. Passive and docile, she had\r\nconsented to her marriage simply from a desire to settle down, and she\r\nwas at a loss to understand such an outburst of jealousy about a former\r\nerror which she repented.\r\n\r\nShe watched her husband, going and coming, turning furiously round, as\r\nshe would have watched a wolf, or an animal of some other species.\r\nWhat was the matter with him? There were so many husbands without\r\nanger. The thing that terrified her was to perceive the brute, whose\r\npresence she had suspected for three years, from certain sullen growls,\r\nat this moment unchained, mad and ready to bite. What could she say to\r\nhim to avert a misfortune?\r\n\r\nAt each turn he came near the bed before her. She awaited him there,\r\nand had sufficient courage to address him.\r\n\r\n"My dear, listen," said she.\r\n\r\nBut he heard not. He went back to the other end of the room, like a bit\r\nof straw beaten about in a storm.\r\n\r\n"What shall I do? What shall I do?" he continued asking.\r\n\r\nAt last she seized him by the wrist, and retained him a minute.\r\n\r\n"My dear, listen," she said. "You know it was I who refused to go to\r\nDoinville. I should never have gone there again. Never! Never! It is\r\nyou I love."\r\n\r\n"Look here," he answered, "if I am to live, I must kill the other! I\r\nmust kill him!--kill him!"\r\n\r\nHis voice rose louder. He repeated the word, erect, grown taller, as if\r\nthis utterance, in bringing him to a resolution, also brought him calm.\r\nHe ceased speaking. He walked slowly to the table, and there, with a\r\ngesture of indifference looked at the knife, whose shimmering blade was\r\nwide open. He closed, and put it in his pocket. Then, with his arms\r\nswinging at his sides, his eyes lost in space, he remained at the same\r\nplace thinking. Obstacles that presented themselves to some plan he was\r\nelaborating in his brain, caused two great wrinkles to appear on his\r\nforehead. To get the better of his difficulty, he went and opened the\r\nwindow, standing before it with his face in the chilly air of twilight.\r\nHis wife in another fright stood up behind him; and, not daring to\r\nquestion him, waited with her face to the expansive sky, endeavouring\r\nto guess what was passing in that hard skull.\r\n\r\nIn the falling shades of night, the distant houses stood out black,\r\nand a violescent mist clouded the vast site of the station. The deep\r\ncutting seemed as if smothered in dust, particularly in the direction\r\nof Batignolles, and the ironwork of the Pont de l\'Europe began to fade\r\naway. Towards Paris a final gleam of daylight whitened the windows\r\nof the great iron marquees, but within they became densely obscure.\r\nSuddenly one saw a glitter of sparks. The men were lighting the\r\ngas-lamps along the platforms. Here a great white spot was formed by\r\nthe lantern on the engine of the Dieppe train, crowded with passengers.\r\nThe doors of the compartments were already closed, and the driver only\r\nawaited the order of the assistant station-master on duty, to start.\r\nBut some hindrance had occurred. The red signal of the pointsman closed\r\nthe line, while a small locomotive came and picked up a few carriages,\r\nwhich a defective man\xc5\x93uvre had left behind.\r\n\r\nTrains flew along without intermission, in the increasing darkness,\r\nover the complicated network of rails, threading their way through\r\nlines of carriages standing motionless on sidings. One started for\r\nArgenteuil, another for Saint Germain. A very long train arrived from\r\nCherbourg. Signals succeeded one another, accompanied by whistles\r\nand blasts of the horn. Lights appeared on every side, one by one:\r\nred, green, yellow, white. There seemed to be a regular confusion at\r\nthis troubled hour when day glides into night, and it looked as if a\r\ntremendous smash would ensue. But everything passed on. The trains\r\nbrushed by each other, detaching themselves from the entanglement, in\r\na smooth, creeping motion that could only be perceived indistinctly in\r\nthe deep crepuscule. But the red light of the pointsman was effaced,\r\nthe Dieppe train blew its whistle, and rolled off. A few drops of rain\r\nbegan to fall from the wan sky. It was going to be a wet night.\r\n\r\nWhen Roubaud turned round, it was with a face cloudy and obstinate,\r\nas if overcast by the shadow of this night that was drawing in. He had\r\nmade up his mind. His plan was formed. In the vanishing darkness, he\r\nlooked at the cuckoo clock, and exclaimed aloud:\r\n\r\n"Twenty minutes past five!"\r\n\r\nHe was astounded; one hour, barely one hour, and so much to do! It\r\nseemed to him that they had been devouring one another there for weeks.\r\n\r\n"Twenty minutes past five!" he muttered. "We shall have enough time."\r\n\r\nS\xc3\xa9verine, without daring to ask a question, continued following him\r\nwith her anxious eyes. She saw him rummage in the cupboard, and bring\r\nout some notepaper, a small bottle of ink, and a pen.\r\n\r\n"What!" she exclaimed. "Are you going to write a letter? To whom?"\r\n\r\n"To him. Sit down."\r\n\r\nAnd, as she instinctively drew away from the chair, ignoring as yet\r\nwhat he was about to exact from her, he brought her back, and weighed\r\nher down so heavily as he seated her at the table, that she remained\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n"Write this: \'Leave to-night by the 6.30 express, and do not show\r\nyourself before you arrive at Rouen.\'"\r\n\r\nShe held the pen, but her hand trembled. Her fright increased at the\r\nthought of all the unknown gaping before her in those two simple lines.\r\nAnd she had the courage to raise her head, and say in a pleading tone:\r\n\r\n"What are you going to do, my dear? I beg you to tell me."\r\n\r\nHe only repeated, in his loud, inexorable voice:\r\n\r\n"Write, write!"\r\n\r\nThen, with his eyes on her eyes, without anger, without ugly words, but\r\nwith such obstinacy that she felt the weight crushing and annihilating\r\nher, he answered:\r\n\r\n"What I am going to do, you will see, well enough. And listen, what I\r\nam going to do, I mean you to do with me. In that way we shall remain\r\ntogether. There will be something binding between us."\r\n\r\nHe terrified her. She drew back again.\r\n\r\n"No, no; I want to know!" she exclaimed. "I will not write without\r\nknowing."\r\n\r\nThen, ceasing to speak, he took her hand--the small, delicate hand of\r\na child, and pressed it in his iron fist, with the continuous pressure\r\nof a vice, until he almost crushed it. He was driving his will into her\r\nflesh with the pain. She uttered a cry. All her spirit was broken, all\r\nher will surrendered. Ignorant creature as she had remained, in her\r\npassive gentleness, she could but obey. Instrument of love, instrument\r\nof death.\r\n\r\n"Write, write!" he repeated again.\r\n\r\nAnd she wrote painfully, with her poor, sore hand.\r\n\r\n"That\'s all right; you are very good," said he, when he had the letter.\r\n"Now tidy the place up a bit, and get everything ready. I\'ll come back\r\nand fetch you."\r\n\r\nHe was quite calm. He arranged the bow of his tie before the\r\nlooking-glass, put on his hat, and took himself off. She heard him\r\ndouble-lock the door, and remove the key. Night was drawing in more\r\nand more. For an instant she remained seated, her ear catching every\r\nsound outside. A continual, low whine came from the adjoining room in\r\noccupation of the newspaper woman: no doubt a little dog forgotten by\r\nits mistress. Below, in the apartment of the Dauvergnes, the piano had\r\nbecome silent. There was now a merry clatter of stewpans and crockery.\r\nThe two little housekeepers were busy in their kitchen, Claire looking\r\nafter a mutton stew, Sophie picking a salad. And S\xc3\xa9verine, prostrated,\r\nlistened to their laughter in the frightful distress of this falling\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nAt a quarter past six, the locomotive of the Havre express, issuing\r\nfrom the Pont de l\'Europe, was switched on to its train and there\r\nsecured. Owing to the metals being occupied, they had been unable to\r\nlodge this train under the marquee of the main lines. It waited in the\r\nopen air beside a prolongation of the platform forming a sort of narrow\r\njetty, in the gloom of an inky sky, where the poorly furnished row of\r\ngas lamps displayed but a line of smoky stars.\r\n\r\nA shower had just ceased, leaving behind a trace of icy dampness spread\r\nover this vast uncovered space, which the mist threw back as far as the\r\npale glimmers on the fa\xc3\xa7ades in the Rue de Rome. This immense, dreary\r\nexpanse, bathed in water, here and there studded with a gory light,\r\nwas broken up by opaque lumps, engines, and solitary carriages, parts\r\nof trains in repose on the shunting lines. And from the depths of this\r\nsheet of darkness came sounds,--giant-like respirations, breathless\r\nwith fever, whistles resembling the piercing shrieks of women, distant,\r\nlamentable blasts of horns mingled with a rumble in the adjoining\r\nstreets. Orders were shouted out to add on a carriage. The engine of\r\nthe express stood motionless, losing by a valve a great jet of steam,\r\nwhich ascended into all this obscurity to spread into small clouds and\r\nsprinkle the boundless veil of mourning drawn across the sky with white\r\ntears.\r\n\r\nAt twenty minutes past six, Roubaud and S\xc3\xa9verine appeared. She had just\r\nreturned the key to Mother Victoire, as she passed by the lavatory,\r\nnear the waiting-rooms. And Roubaud, impatient and blunt, his hat on\r\nthe back of his head, urged her on, after the fashion of a husband with\r\nno time to lose, who is being delayed by his wife; while she, with her\r\nveil drawn tight over her face, advanced slowly as if broken down with\r\nfatigue.\r\n\r\nJoining the flood of passengers streaming along the platform,\r\nthey followed the line of carriages, on the look-out for an empty\r\nfirst-class compartment. The footway became alive with porters\r\nrolling trucks of luggage to the van at the head of the train. An\r\ninspector was busy finding seats for a numerous family, the assistant\r\nstation-master on duty, with his signal lantern in his hand, glanced\r\nat the couplings, to see that the spreaders had been properly screwed\r\nup. And Roubaud, having at length found an empty compartment, was\r\nabout to assist S\xc3\xa9verine to get in, when he perceived M. Vandorpe, the\r\nhead-station-master, strolling along in company with M. Dauvergne,\r\nhis deputy-chief of the main lines, both watching the man\xc5\x93uvre\r\nconnected with the carriage that was being added to the train. Roubaud,\r\nexchanging greetings with them, found it necessary to stop and have a\r\nchat.\r\n\r\nFirst of all they spoke of the business with the sub-prefect, which\r\nhad terminated to the satisfaction of everyone. Then the conversation\r\nturned to an accident that had happened in the morning at Havre,\r\nthe news having come by telegraph. A locomotive, called La Lison,\r\nwhich on Thursday and Saturday took the 6.30 express, had broken its\r\nconnecting-rod, just as the train entered the station; and the repairs\r\nwould give two days\' holiday to Jacques Lantier, the driver, who came\r\nfrom the same part of the country as Roubaud, and to his fireman,\r\nPecqueux, the husband of Mother Victoire.\r\n\r\nS\xc3\xa9verine remained standing before the door of the compartment, while\r\nher husband affected great freedom of mind in conversation with these\r\ngentlemen, raising his voice and laughing. But there came a shock, and\r\nthe train recoiled a few yards. It was the locomotive, driving back\r\nthe first carriages to the one that had just been added on, the No.\r\n293, so as to have a reserved coup\xc3\xa9. And Henri Dauvergne, the son, who\r\naccompanied the train as headguard, having recognised S\xc3\xa9verine through\r\nher veil, had prevented her from receiving a knock from the wide-open\r\ndoor, by pulling her away without ceremony. Then, excusing himself,\r\nsmiling, very amiable, he explained that the coup\xc3\xa9 was for one of the\r\ndirectors of the company, who had sent to ask for it half an hour\r\nbefore the time for the train to start. She gave a little, senseless\r\nlaugh, and he ran off to attend to his work.\r\n\r\nThe clock marked 6.27. Three minutes more. Roubaud, who was watching\r\nthe doors of the waiting-rooms in the distance, while chatting with the\r\nstation-master, suddenly left the latter to return to S\xc3\xa9verine. But the\r\ncarriage having moved back, they had to make their way to the empty\r\ncompartment a few paces off. Roubaud pushed his wife along, and with\r\nan effort of the wrist, made her get into the carriage; while she, in\r\nher anxious docility, looked instinctively behind her, to see what was\r\ngoing on.\r\n\r\nA passenger behind time had just arrived, carrying only a rug in his\r\nhand. He had the broad collar of his blue top-coat turned up, and\r\nthe rim of his bowler hat brought down so low over his eyebrows that\r\nnothing could be seen of his face, in the vacillating gaslight, but a\r\nbit of white beard. M. Vandorpe and M. Dauvergne advanced and followed\r\nthe passenger, notwithstanding his evident desire to avoid being\r\nseen. He only greeted them three carriages further on, when in front\r\nof the reserved coup\xc3\xa9, in which he hurriedly took a seat. It was the\r\nPresident. S\xc3\xa9verine, in a tremble, sank down on a seat, her husband\r\nbruised her arm in his grasp, as if in a final act of taking possession\r\nof her, exulting, now that he was certain of doing the thing he had\r\nthought out in his mind.\r\n\r\nA minute later the half hour would strike. A newspaper seller\r\nstubbornly offered the evening editions, a few passengers still\r\nstrolled along the platform finishing cigarettes. But all took\r\ntheir seats. The inspectors could be heard coming from both ends\r\nof the train, closing the doors. And Roubaud, who had met with the\r\ndisagreeable surprise of perceiving a sombre form occupying a corner\r\nin the compartment which he had thought empty, no doubt a woman in\r\nmourning, who remained mute and motionless, could not restrain an\r\nexclamation of real anger, when the door opened again, and an inspector\r\npushed in a stout man and a stout woman, who flopped down on a seat,\r\ngasping.\r\n\r\nThey were about to start. The very fine rain had recommenced, drowning\r\nthe vast, dark expanse, which was crossed incessantly by trains\r\nthat presented nothing distinguishable but a moving line of small,\r\nbright windows. Green lights had been lit, a few lanterns danced on a\r\nlevel with the ground; and there was nothing else, nothing but black\r\nimmensity, where alone appeared the marquees of the main lines, pale\r\nwith a dim reflex of gas. All had disappeared, even the sounds had\r\nbecome muffled. The roar of the engine, opening its exhaust pipes,\r\nto let out a whirling wave of white steam, alone could be heard. A\r\ncloud ascended, unrolling like the winding-sheet of an apparition, and\r\ndivided by dense black smoke springing from some invisible source. The\r\nsky was once more obscured, a volume of soot flew over nocturnal Paris,\r\nablaze with luminosity.\r\n\r\nThen the assistant station-master on duty, raised his lantern for the\r\nengine-driver to inquire if the line was free. Two whistles were heard;\r\nand away, near the box of the pointsman, the red light vanished, to be\r\nsucceeded by a white one. The headguard, standing at the door of his\r\nvan, awaited the order to start, which he transmitted. The driver gave\r\na long whistle, and opening the regulator, set the locomotive moving.\r\nThey were off. At first the motion was imperceptible, then the train\r\nrolled along. Darting under the Pont de l\'Europe, it plunged towards\r\nthe Batignolles tunnel. All that could be seen of it were the three\r\nlights behind, the red triangle looking like gaping wounds. For a few\r\nseconds longer, it could be followed in the chilling darkness of night.\r\nNow it flew on its way, and nothing now could stop this train, launched\r\nat full speed. It disappeared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nThe house at La Croix-de-Maufras stands aslant, in a garden which the\r\nrailway has cut in two, and is so near the metals that it feels the\r\nshock of every train passing by. A single journey suffices to bear it\r\naway in memory. The entire multitude, who have flown along the line,\r\nare aware of its existence at this spot, without knowing aught about\r\nit. Always closed, it looks as if deserted in distress, with its grey\r\nshutters turning green through the effects of the rain beating against\r\nthem from the west. Standing in a wilderness, it seems to increase the\r\nsolitude of this out-of-the-way corner, where scarcely a soul breathes\r\nfor three or four miles around.\r\n\r\nThe only other house there, is that of the gatekeeper, at the angle\r\nwhere the road crosses the rails on its way to Doinville, four miles\r\noff. Low in build, the walls seamed with cracks, the tiles of the root\r\ndevoured by moss, it lies crushed, with a neglectful aspect of poverty,\r\nin the middle of the garden surrounding it--a garden planted with\r\nvegetables, enclosed by a quickset hedge, and where a great well rises\r\nalmost as high as the habitation itself.\r\n\r\nThe level crossing is just half-way between the two stations of\r\nMalaunay and Barentin, being three miles from each. It is but little\r\nused. The old decaying gate rarely rolls back, save for the stone-drays\r\nfrom the quarries at B\xc3\xa9court, half a league distant in the forest.\r\nIt would be difficult to imagine a more out-of-the-way place, or one\r\nmore completely separated from humanity, for the long tunnel in\r\nthe direction of Malaunay, cuts off every road, and the only way to\r\ncommunicate with Barentin is by a neglected pathway beside the line.\r\nVisitors therefore are scarce.\r\n\r\nOn this particular evening, as night was drawing in, a traveller who\r\nhad just left a train from Havre, at Barentin, followed with long\r\nstrides the pathway of La Croix-de-Maufras. The country thereabouts\r\nis but one uninterrupted set of hills and dales, a sort of waving of\r\nthe soil, which the railway crosses on embankments and in cuttings,\r\nalternately. The continual unevenness of the ground, the ascents and\r\ndescents on either side of the line, make walking difficult and add\r\nto the feeling of deep solitude. The impoverished, whitish land lies\r\nfallow, the hillocks are crowned with small woods, while brooks, shaded\r\nwith willows, run at the bottom of the narrow ravines. Certain chalky\r\nelevations are absolutely bare, and sterile hills succeed one another\r\nin the silence and abandonment of death. The young, lusty traveller\r\nhastened his steps, as if to escape from the sadness of the twilight,\r\nfalling so gently over this desolate country.\r\n\r\nIn the garden of the gatekeeper, a girl was drawing water at the well:\r\na tall lass of eighteen; fair, robust, with thick lips, greenish eyes,\r\na low forehead, and a heavy head of hair. She was not pretty, and\r\nhad the heavy hips and muscular arms of a young man. As soon as she\r\nperceived the traveller coming down the path, she let go the pail and\r\nran to the garden gate, exclaiming:\r\n\r\n"Hullo! Jacques!"\r\n\r\nHe raised his head. He had just completed his twenty-seventh year. He\r\nalso was tall, and very dark. A handsome fellow, with his round face\r\nand regular features, which nevertheless were marred by too heavy a\r\njaw. His thick hair curled, as did his moustache, which was so full, so\r\nblack, that it seemed to add to the pallidness of his complexion. From\r\nhis delicate skin, carefully shaved on the cheeks, anyone would have\r\ntaken him for a gentleman, had it not been for the indelible imprint of\r\nthe workman that he bore on his engine-driver hands, which were already\r\nturning yellow with grease, although remaining small and flexible.\r\n\r\n"Good evening, Flore," he simply said.\r\n\r\nBut his large dark eyes, studded with golden sparks, had become\r\ntroubled with a reddish cloud, which made them dim. The lids were\r\nblinking, the eyes turned away in sudden constraint, and he experienced\r\na feeling of uneasiness that went so far as to cause him suffering. His\r\nwhole frame instinctively made a movement as if to draw back.\r\n\r\nShe, standing motionless, her eyes looking straight at him, had\r\nperceived this involuntary shudder, that came on him, and which he\r\nendeavoured to master, each time that he approached a woman. It seemed\r\nto make her quite serious and sad. Then, when he asked her, in view\r\nof concealing his embarrassment, if her mother was at home, although\r\nknowing she was unwell and unable to leave the house, the girl only\r\nanswered with a nod, standing aside so that he might come in without\r\ntouching her; and, erect and proud, she returned without a word to the\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nJacques crossed the small garden at his rapid stride, and entered the\r\ndwelling. There, in the centre of the first room, a sort of large\r\nkitchen where the family took their meals and lived, Aunt Phasie, as\r\nhe had called her from infancy, was alone, seated near the table on a\r\nrush-bottomed chair, with her legs wrapped in an old shawl. She was\r\na cousin of his father, a Lantier, who had stood godmother to him;\r\nand who, when he was no more than six, had taken care of him, at the\r\ntime when his father and mother had flown off to Paris, and there\r\ndisappeared. He had then remained at Plassans, where, later on, he had\r\nfollowed the classes at the \xc3\x89cole des Arts et M\xc3\xa9tiers. He bore Aunt\r\nPhasie great gratitude, and was in the habit of saying that if he had\r\nmade his way, it was entirely due to her.\r\n\r\nWhen he became a driver of the first class in the Western Railway\r\nCompany, after passing a couple of years on the Orleans Railway, he had\r\nfound his godmother married again to a level crossing gatekeeper named\r\nMisard, and exiled with the two daughters of her first marriage to this\r\nout-of-the-way place, called La Croix-de-Maufras. At the present time\r\nAunt Phasie, although barely forty-five, and who formerly had been so\r\ntall and strong, looked sixty. Moreover, she had grown thin and yellow,\r\nand was a prey to constant shivers.\r\n\r\nShe welcomed Jacques with joy.\r\n\r\n"What! is it you, Jacques?" she exclaimed. "Ah! my bonny lad, what a\r\nsurprise!"\r\n\r\nHe kissed her cheeks, explaining that he had suddenly come into a\r\ncouple of days\' enforced holiday. La Lison, his engine, on reaching\r\nHavre in the morning, had broken its connecting-rod; and as the repairs\r\nwould take four-and-twenty hours, he would not resume duty until the\r\nfollowing evening for the 6.40 express. So he had come over to see her.\r\nHe would sleep there, and catch the 7.26 train from Barentin in the\r\nmorning. And he kept her poor, withered hands in his own, telling her\r\nhow anxious her last letter had made him.\r\n\r\n"Ah! yes, my lad, I am not well, I am not at all well. How nice of you\r\nto have guessed my desire to see you! But I know what little time you\r\nhave of your own, and did not dare ask you to run over. Anyhow, here\r\nyou are, and I have so much, so much on my mind!"\r\n\r\nShe broke off to cast a timid glance out of the window. On the other\r\nside of the metals, in the twilight, her husband could be perceived\r\nin his box, one of those wooden huts erected every four or five miles\r\nalong the line, and connected by telegraph to ensure the satisfactory\r\nrunning of the trains. While his wife, and, later on, Flore, had been\r\nplaced in charge of the gate at the level crossing, Misard had been\r\nmade a watchman of the line.\r\n\r\nIn fear of him hearing her, she lowered her voice, and said with a\r\nshudder:\r\n\r\n"I verily believe he is poisoning me!"\r\n\r\nJacques started in surprise at this disclosure, and his eyes, also\r\nturning towards the window, were again deadened by the peculiar trouble\r\nto which he was accustomed, that little reddish haze which dimmed their\r\nbrilliant black full of golden sparks.\r\n\r\n"Oh! Aunt Phasie, what an idea!" he murmured. "He looks such a gentle,\r\nweak creature."\r\n\r\nA train had just passed, going in the direction of Havre, and Misard\r\nhad left his box to block the line behind it. Jacques looked at him as\r\nhe pulled up the lever to show the red signal. He was a little puny\r\nman, with thin, discoloured hair and beard, and a lean, hollow-cheeked\r\nface. Moreover, he was silent, retiring, never angry, and obsequiously\r\npolite in presence of his chiefs. But he had returned to his box to\r\nnote down in his register the hour at which the train had passed, and\r\npress the two electric buttons, one opening the line at the preceding\r\npost, the other announcing the coming of the train at the box after his.\r\n\r\n"Ah! you don\'t know him," resumed Aunt Phasie; "I tell you that he must\r\nbe giving me some filth. I, who was so strong, who would have eaten him\r\nup; and it is he, this bit of a man, this insignificant creature, who\r\nis devouring me!"\r\n\r\nShe was burning with concealed timorous spite, and unbosomed herself,\r\ndelighted to have at last found someone who would listen to her. What\r\ncould she have been thinking of to have married such a cunning fellow,\r\nwithout a sou and miserly, she who was more than five years his senior,\r\nwith two daughters, one already eight, and the other six? It was now\r\nclose on ten years since she had done this famous business, and not an\r\nhour had passed without her repenting it--a poverty-stricken existence,\r\nexiled to this icy quarter in the north, where she was shivering with\r\ncold, wearied to death at not having a soul to speak to, not a single\r\nneighbour. He, formerly a plate-layer, now earned 1,200 frcs. a year\r\nas watchman; she, from the commencement, had received 50 frcs. for\r\nthe gate, which was now in charge of Flore. Such was the present and\r\nfuture, no other hope; the certainty of living and dying in this hole,\r\nfar away from their fellow creatures.\r\n\r\n"I tell you," she repeated to conclude, "that it is he who is tampering\r\nwith me, and that he\'ll do for me, little as he is."\r\n\r\nThe sudden tinkling of an alarum made her cast the same anxious glance\r\noutside as before. This was the preceding post informing Misard that\r\na train was coming in the direction of Paris, and the needle of the\r\napparatus, standing in front of the window, pointed that way. Stopping\r\nthe ringing, he went out to signal the train by two blasts of the\r\nhorn, while Flore, at the same moment, came and closed the gate. Then,\r\nplanting herself before it, she held the flag up straight in its\r\nleather case. The train, an express, hidden by a curve, could be heard\r\nadvancing with a roar that grew louder as it approached. It passed like\r\na thunderbolt, shaking, threatening to carry away the low habitation in\r\na tempestuous gust of wind.\r\n\r\nFlore returned to her vegetables; while Misard, after blocking the\r\nup-line behind the train, went to open the down-line, by lowering the\r\nlever to efface the red signal, for another tinkling, accompanied by\r\nthe rise of the other needle, had just warned him that the train which\r\nhad gone by five minutes previously was clear of the next post. He\r\nreturned to his box, communicated with the two watchmen, jotted down\r\nthe passing of the train, and waited. It was always the same kind of\r\nwork that he did, for twelve consecutive hours, living there, eating\r\nthere, without reading half a dozen lines of a newspaper, without\r\nappearing even to have a single thought in his slanting skull.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps he is jealous," suggested Jacques.\r\n\r\nBut Aunt Phasie shrugged her shoulders in pity.\r\n\r\n"Ah! my lad, what is that you say? He jealous!"\r\n\r\nThen, with the old shiver upon her, she added:\r\n\r\n"No, no, he never cared for me. All he cares for is money. Why we\r\nquarrelled, you see, was because I would not give him the 1,000 frcs. I\r\ninherited from father last year. Then, just as he threatened me that it\r\nwould bring me bad luck, I fell ill. And the complaint has not left me\r\nsince. Yes, it is exactly from that time that I have been unwell."\r\n\r\nThe young man understood her idea; and, attributing it to the gloomy\r\nthoughts of a sick woman, he still endeavoured to dissuade her. But she\r\nobstinately shook her head, like a person who has made up her mind. So\r\nthat he ended by saying:\r\n\r\n"Very well then, the remedy is as simple as can be. If you want to put\r\nan end to the thing, give him your 1,000 frcs."\r\n\r\nBy an extraordinary effort she rose to her feet; and, resuscitated, as\r\nit were, she violently answered:\r\n\r\n"My 1,000 frcs.? Never! I would sooner burst. Ah! they are hidden, and\r\nwell hidden, take my word! The house may be turned upside down, but I\r\ndefy anyone to find them. And he has had a good try, the demon! I have\r\nheard him at night time, sounding all the walls. Search, search! The\r\nmere pleasure of watching his nose grow longer, would suffice to give\r\nme patience. We shall see who will give up first, him or me. I am on my\r\nguard, and swallow nothing that he touches. And if I kick the bucket,\r\nwell, he will not even then get my 1,000 frcs. I prefer leaving them to\r\nthe earth."\r\n\r\nShe sank back into the chair exhausted, shaking at another sound of the\r\nhorn. It came from Misard, who, standing at the door of his box, this\r\ntime signalled a train on its way to Havre. In spite of her obstinate\r\ndetermination to withhold the legacy, she had a secret and increasing\r\nfear of him, the same kind of fear as that of a giant, for the insect\r\nhe feels devouring him.\r\n\r\nThe train signalled, the slow train which had left Paris at 12.45, was\r\ncoming along in the distance with a dull rumble. It could be heard\r\nissuing from the tunnel and puffing louder in the open country. Then\r\nit passed amidst the thunder of its wheels, and its mass of carriages,\r\nwith the invincible might of a hurricane.\r\n\r\nJacques, with his eyes raised towards the window, had watched the small\r\nsquares of glass file past. Wishing to turn aside the gloomy ideas of\r\nAunt Phasie, he resumed in a joking vein:\r\n\r\n"Godmother, you complain that you never see a soul in this hole; but\r\nthere are people for you!"\r\n\r\nFailing, at first, to catch his meaning, she looked astounded, and\r\ninquired:\r\n\r\n"Where are there any people?" Then, understanding, she added: "Ah! yes,\r\nthose folk who go by. What good are they? One does not know them, one\r\ncannot chat with them."\r\n\r\nHe continued in a merry tone:\r\n\r\n"But me, you know me well enough; you often see me pass."\r\n\r\n"You, that\'s true. I know you, and I know the time of your train," she\r\nanswered. "Only, you fly, fly along! Yesterday you did so with your\r\nhand. I can\'t even answer. No, no, that\'s no way of seeing people."\r\n\r\nNevertheless, this idea of the multitude the up and down trains carried\r\nalong daily before her, amidst the deep silence of her solitude,\r\nmade her pensive, and she turned her eyes to the line where night\r\nwas drawing in. When in good health, and she went and came, planting\r\nherself before the gate, her flag in her hand, she never thought of\r\nsuch things. But since she had been remaining for days on this chair,\r\nwith naught to think of but her underhand struggle with this man,\r\nconfused reveries, barely formulated, had set her head topsy-turvy.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to her so strange that she should be living here, lost in\r\nthe depths of this desert, without a soul in whom she could confide,\r\nwhen so many men and women filed past in the tempestuous blast of the\r\ntrains, shaking the house, tearing along full steam, day and night\r\ncontinually. Certainly all the inhabitants of the earth went by there,\r\nnot only Frenchmen, foreigners also; persons come from the most distant\r\nlands, as no one could now remain at home, and as all people, according\r\nto what had been written, would soon be but one. This was progress:\r\nbrothers all, rolling along together, yonder towards a land of plenty.\r\n\r\nShe endeavoured to count them, to arrive at an average, so many for\r\neach carriage; but there were too many, she could not manage it.\r\nFrequently she fancied she recognised faces: that of a gentleman with\r\na light beard, doubtless an Englishman who travelled to Paris every\r\nweek; that of a little dark lady, who went by regularly on Wednesday\r\nand Saturday. But the flash bore them off, and she was not quite sure\r\nshe had seen them. All the faces became confused, blended together, as\r\nif alike, disappearing one in the other. The torrent ran on, leaving\r\nnothing of itself behind. And what made her sad at the sight of this\r\nconstant movement, amid so much well-being and so much money, was to\r\nfeel that this panting multitude was ignorant of her being there, in\r\ndanger of death, so that if her husband some night polished her off,\r\nthe trains would continue passing one another, close to her corpse,\r\nwithout anyone even suspecting the crime within the solitary habitation.\r\n\r\nAunt Phasie had remained with her eyes on the window, and she summed\r\nup what she felt; but her feelings were too vague to be explained at\r\nlength.\r\n\r\n"Ah! it\'s a fine invention, there\'s no doubt of it. People go along\r\nquick, and become more learned. But wild beasts remain wild beasts,\r\nand people may invent even finer machines still; but, nevertheless,\r\nthere will be wild beasts in spite of all."\r\n\r\nJacques tossed his head to say that he thought as she did. For a few\r\nmoments he had been watching Flore, who had opened the gate for a\r\nquarry dray loaded with two enormous blocks of stone. The road only\r\nserved for the B\xc3\xa9court quarries, so that the gate was padlocked at\r\nnight, and Flore rarely had to get up to unlock it. Observing her\r\nchatting familiarly with the quarryman, a dark young fellow, Jacques\r\nexclaimed:\r\n\r\n"Hullo! Cabuche must be ill, as his cousin Louis is in charge of the\r\nhorses. Poor Cabuche! Do you often see him, godmother?"\r\n\r\nShe raised her hands without answering, heaving a great sigh.\r\nThe previous autumn there had been a regular drama which had not\r\ncontributed to improve her health. Her younger daughter, Louisette,\r\nin service as housemaid with Madame Bonnehon at Doinville, had ran\r\naway at night, half crazy and black and blue, to go and die at the hut\r\nwhich her sweetheart, Cabuche, occupied in the middle of the forest.\r\nAll manner of tales had got about reflecting on President Grandmorin;\r\nbut no one dared repeat them aloud. Even her mother, who knew what had\r\nhappened, did not like returning to the subject. Nevertheless, she\r\nended by saying:\r\n\r\n"No. He never looks in. He is becoming as shy as a wolf. Poor\r\nLouisette, who was such a pet, so white, so sweet! She really loved\r\nme, and would have nursed me, she would! Whereas Flore, well, I don\'t\r\ncomplain of her, but she has certainly something wrong with her head,\r\nalways doing just as she likes, disappearing for hours together. And\r\nthen proud and violent! It is all very sad, very sad."\r\n\r\nJacques, while listening, continued following the stone-dray with his\r\neyes. It was now crossing the line, but the wheels had got clogged by\r\nthe metals, and the driver had to clack his whip, while Flore shouted\r\nto excite the horses.\r\n\r\n"The deuce!" exclaimed the young man, "it wouldn\'t do for a train to\r\ncome along now. There would be a smash!"\r\n\r\n"Oh! there is no fear of that," replied Aunt Phasie. "Flore is\r\nsometimes funny, but she knows her business. She keeps her eyes open.\r\nIt is now five years since we had an accident, thank God. A long time\r\nback a man was cut to pieces. We have only had a cow, which almost\r\nupset a train. Ah! the poor creature! We found its body here, and its\r\nhead over there, near the tunnel. With Flore one can sleep soundly."\r\n\r\nThe stone-dray had passed on. The loud shocks of the wheels in the ruts\r\ncould be heard growing less distinct in the distance. Then Aunt Phasie\r\nreturned to the subject that constantly occupied her thoughts--the\r\nquestion of health, in regard to others as much as herself.\r\n\r\n"And you," she inquired, "are you quite well now? You remember, when\r\nyou were with us, that complaint you suffered from, and of which the\r\ndoctor could make neither head nor tail?"\r\n\r\nHis eyes became restless.\r\n\r\n"I am very well, godmother," said he.\r\n\r\n"Truly? It has all disappeared?" she inquired again. "That pain boring\r\ninto your skull behind the ears, and the abrupt strokes of fever, and\r\nthose periods of sadness, which made you hide yourself like an animal\r\nat the bottom of a hole?"\r\n\r\nAs she proceeded, he became more and more troubled, and got so\r\ndreadfully uneasy that, at last, he interrupted her, saying in a brief\r\ntone:\r\n\r\n"I assure you I am very well. I feel nothing of all that. Nothing at\r\nall."\r\n\r\n"Well, so much the better, my lad," said she. "The fact of you being\r\nill would not cure me. And then, you\'re of an age to enjoy good health.\r\nAh! health! there is nothing like it. It is all the same very kind of\r\nyou to have come to see me, when you could have been enjoying yourself\r\nsomewhere else. You\'ll have dinner with us, won\'t you? And you\'ll sleep\r\nup there in the loft, next to the room Flore occupies?"\r\n\r\nBut another blare of the horn interrupted her. Night had closed in,\r\nand, turning towards the window, they could only confusedly distinguish\r\nMisard talking with another man. Six o\'clock had just struck, and he\r\nwas giving over his service to the night watchman. At length he was\r\nabout to be free after twelve hours passed in this hut, furnished only\r\nwith a small table under the shelf supporting the apparatus, a stool,\r\nand a stove which threw out so much heat, that he was obliged to almost\r\nconstantly keep the door open.\r\n\r\n"Ah! here he is, he is returning home," murmured Aunt Phasie, in a\r\nfright again.\r\n\r\nThe train signalled was coming, very heavy, very long, roaring louder\r\nand louder as it approached, and the young man had to bend forward to\r\nhear what the invalid said, feeling pained at the wretched state she\r\nwas putting herself in, and anxious to relieve her.\r\n\r\n"Listen, godmother, if he really has bad intentions, perhaps it would\r\nstop him if he was to know that I have taken up the matter. You would\r\ndo well to entrust your 1,000 frcs. to me."\r\n\r\nShe gave a final outburst.\r\n\r\n"My 1,000 frcs.!" she exclaimed. "Not to you any more than to him! I\r\ntell you I\'d sooner die!"\r\n\r\nAt this moment the train passed in its storm-like violence, as if\r\nit would sweep everything before it. The house shook, enveloped in a\r\ngust of wind. This particular train, on its way to Havre, was very\r\ncrowded, for there was to be a f\xc3\xaate on the following day, a Sunday,\r\nin connection with a launch. Notwithstanding the speed, by the lit-up\r\nglass of the doors one caught sight of the full compartments, of the\r\nlines of heads side by side, close together, each with its particular\r\nprofile. They followed one another and disappeared.\r\n\r\nWhat a multitude! The crowd again, the crowd without end, amidst\r\nthe rolling of the carriages, the whistling of the locomotives,\r\nthe tinkling of the telegraph, the ringing of bells! It was like a\r\nhuge body, a gigantic being stretched across the earth, the head at\r\nParis, the vertebr\xc3\xa6 all along the line, the limbs expanding with the\r\nembranchments, the feet and hands at Havre and at the other termini.\r\nAnd it passed, passed, mechanically, triumphant, advancing to the\r\nfuture with mathematical precision, careless as to what remained of man\r\non either side of it, who, although concealed, was still replete with\r\nlife, the embodiment of eternal passion and eternal love.\r\n\r\nFlore came in first, and lit the lamp, a small petroleum lamp without\r\na shade, and laid the table. Not a word did they exchange. She barely\r\nthrew a glance at Jacques, who stood before the window with his back\r\nturned. A _soupe-aux-choux_ was being kept warm on the stove. When\r\nMisard made his appearance she was serving it. He showed no surprise\r\nto find the young man there. Perhaps he had seen him arrive. He\r\ndisplayed no curiosity to know what had brought him there, and asked no\r\nquestions. A pressure of the hand, three brief words, and nothing more.\r\nJacques had to take the initiative of repeating the tale about the\r\nbroken connecting-rod, and how he had then thought of running over to\r\nkiss his aunt. Misard was content to gently toss his head, as if to say\r\nhe considered this quite proper, and they sat down, eating slowly, and,\r\nat first, in silence.\r\n\r\nAunt Phasie, who since the morning had not taken her eyes from the pot\r\nwhere the _soupe-aux-choux_ was simmering, accepted a plateful. But her\r\nhusband having risen to give her the iron-water forgotten by Flore,\r\na decanter in which a few nails were rusting, she did not touch it.\r\nHe, humble, puny, coughing with a nasty little cough, did not seem to\r\nremark the anxious look with which she followed his slightest movement.\r\nWhen she asked for salt, there being none on the table, he told her she\r\nwould repent of eating so much, that it was this that made her ill;\r\nand he rose to take some, bringing her a pinch in a spoon, which she\r\naccepted without distrust, salt purifying everything, as she said. Then\r\nthey spoke of the really mild weather that had prevailed for some days,\r\nand of a train that had run off the rails at Maromme. Jacques began to\r\nthink that his godmother must suffer from nightmare while wide awake,\r\nfor he could see nothing suspicious about this bit of a man, who was\r\nso civil, and had such expressionless eyes. They remained more than\r\nan hour at table. Twice Flore disappeared, for a few moments, at the\r\nsignal of the horn. The trains went by, making the glasses ring on the\r\ntable; but no one paid the least attention.\r\n\r\nAnother blare of the horn, and Flore, who had just cleared the cloth,\r\nwithdrew and did not return. She left her mother and the two men seated\r\nat table before a bottle of cider brandy. All three remained thus\r\nanother half hour. Then Misard, whose ferreting eyes had been resting\r\nfor a minute or two on a corner of the room, took his cap and went out,\r\nwith a simple good-night. He was in the habit of poaching in the little\r\nneighbouring brooks, which harboured superb eels, and never went to bed\r\nwithout examining his lines.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he had gone, Aunt Phasie looked fixedly at her godson, and\r\nexclaimed:\r\n\r\n"Eh! What do you think of that? Did you see him searching over there\r\nwith his eyes in that corner? He has got an idea that I have hidden my\r\nhoard behind the butter-jar. Ah! I know him, I am certain he will move\r\nthe jar to-night to have a look."\r\n\r\nBut she began perspiring, and trembling from head to foot.\r\n\r\n"You see, there it is again! He must have drugged me. My mouth is as\r\nbitter as if I had been swallowing old sous, though God knows I have\r\ntaken nothing from his hand! It\'s enough to make one drown oneself. I\r\ncan\'t sit up any longer to-night. It\'s better for me to go to bed. So\r\ngood-bye, my lad, because if you leave at 7.26 it will be too early for\r\nme. And come again, won\'t you? And let\'s hope I shall still be here."\r\n\r\nHe had to assist her to her room, where she got into bed, and went off\r\nto sleep, exhausted. Left by himself, he hesitated, thinking whether\r\nit would not be as well if he were to retire for the night also, and\r\nstretch himself out on the hay awaiting him upstairs in the loft. But\r\nit was only ten minutes to eight; he had plenty of time for sleep. And\r\nso, he too went out, leaving the little petroleum lamp alight in the\r\nempty, slumbering house, shaken ever and anon by the abrupt thunder of\r\na train.\r\n\r\nJacques was surprised at the mildness of the air outside. No doubt it\r\nwould rain again. A uniform milky cloud had spread over the sky, and\r\nthe full moon, concealed behind it, lit up the whole vault of heaven\r\nwith a reddish reflex. He could clearly distinguish the country. The\r\nland around him, the hills, the trees stood out in black against this\r\nequal, deadened light, soft as that of a night lamp. He walked round\r\nthe little kitchen garden. Then he thought of going towards Doinville,\r\nas the road in that direction was not so steep as the other way. But\r\nthe sight of the solitary house planted aslant on the opposite side of\r\nthe line having caught his attention, he crossed the metals, passing by\r\nthe side gate, the big one being already closed for the night.\r\n\r\nHe knew this house very well. He gazed at it on each of his journeys,\r\namid the roar and jolting of his engine. It haunted him, without him\r\nbeing able to understand why, save for a confused sensation that it\r\nhad something to do with his existence. Each time he went up and down\r\nthe line, he first of all experienced a sort of dread lest he should\r\nfind it no longer there, then he felt a kind of uneasiness when he\r\nperceived it still in the same place. He had never seen either the\r\ndoors or windows open. All he had learnt about it was that it belonged\r\nto President Grandmorin, and on this particular night he was beset by\r\nan irresistible desire to wander round about it, so as to ascertain\r\nsomething more.\r\n\r\nJacques remained a long time on the road, facing the iron railings. He\r\nstepped back, raised himself on his toes, endeavouring to form some\r\nidea of the place. The railway, in cutting through the garden, had only\r\nleft a small plot enclosed by walls in front of the house; while behind\r\nwas a rather large piece of ground, simply surrounded by a quickset\r\nhedge. The dwelling, with its distressful-looking appearance, had an\r\nair of lugubrious sadness in the red reflex of this fumy night; and\r\nJacques was about to leave it, with a shiver running over his skin,\r\nwhen he noticed a hole in the hedge. The idea that it would be cowardly\r\nnot to go in, made him push through. His heart was beating; but,\r\nimmediately, as he passed beside a greenhouse in ruins, he stopped at\r\nthe sight of something dark, in a heap at the door.\r\n\r\n"What! Is that you?" he exclaimed, astonished, recognising Flore. "What\r\nare you doing here?"\r\n\r\nShe also started with surprise. Then she answered tranquilly:\r\n\r\n"You can see; I\'m taking cords. They have left a heap there, that are\r\nrotting, without being used by anybody, and as I am always in need of\r\nthem, I run over and take them."\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, seated on the ground, with a stout pair of scissors in her\r\nhand, she was undoing the bits of cord, cutting the knots, when she\r\nfailed to get them apart.\r\n\r\n"Doesn\'t the owner come here any more, then?" inquired the young man.\r\n\r\nShe began laughing.\r\n\r\n"Oh! since that affair of Louisette," she replied, "there\'s no fear of\r\nthe President risking the tip of his nose at La Croix-de-Maufras. I can\r\npick up his cords without fear."\r\n\r\nHe remained silent for a moment, and seemed troubled by the thought of\r\nthe tragic adventure she alluded to.\r\n\r\n"And do you believe what Louisette said?" he asked.\r\n\r\nCeasing to laugh, she suddenly became violent, and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n"Louisette never lied, nor did Cabuche. He is my friend."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps your sweetheart?" suggested Jacques.\r\n\r\n"He, indeed!" she replied. "No, no; he is my friend. I have no\r\nsweetheart, and I don\'t want one."\r\n\r\nShe raised her powerful head, with its thick yellow mane curling very\r\nlow on the forehead, and from all her massive, supple body, burst a\r\nsavage energy of will. Already a legend was growing up about her in\r\nthe neighbourhood. Stories were related of heroic deeds of salvage: a\r\ncart torn with a mighty jerk from before a train; a railway carriage\r\nstopped while descending the declivity at Barentin alone, like some\r\nfurious beast bounding along to encounter an express. Then there was\r\nthe tale of her adventure with a pointsman at the Dieppe embranchment,\r\nat the other end of the tunnel, a certain Ozil, a man about thirty,\r\nwhom she seemed to have encouraged for a short time, but who having\r\nbeen so ill-advised as to attempt to take a liberty, had almost met his\r\ndeath from a blow she dealt him with a club. Virgin and warlike, she\r\ndisdained the male, which finally convinced people that she certainly\r\nhad something wrong with her head.\r\n\r\nJacques, hearing her declare that she did not want a sweetheart,\r\ncontinued his fun:\r\n\r\n"Then your marriage with Ozil can\'t be in a good way? Yet I\'ve heard it\r\nsaid that you run to meet him every day through the tunnel."\r\n\r\nShe shrugged her shoulders.\r\n\r\n"Ah! To Jericho, my marriage!" she retorted. "What you say about the\r\ntunnel makes me laugh. Two miles to gallop over in the darkness, with\r\nthe thought that you may get cut in two by a train if you don\'t keep\r\nyour eyes open. You should hear them snorting in there! But Ozil\r\nworried me. He\'s not the one I want."\r\n\r\n"Then you want someone else?"\r\n\r\n"Ah! I don\'t know. Ah! faith, no!"\r\n\r\nShe had burst into a laugh again, while a slight embarrassment made her\r\ngive her attention to a knot in the cords which she could not manage to\r\nundo. Then, without raising her head, as if very much absorbed by her\r\noccupation, she said:\r\n\r\n"And you, have you no sweetheart?"\r\n\r\nJacques, in his turn, became serious. He avoided looking at her, his\r\neyes moved restlessly from side to side, and were at last fixed on\r\nspace in the night. Abruptly he answered:\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"Just so," she continued; "they told me you held women in abomination.\r\nAnd, besides, I\'ve known you for a very long time, and you have never\r\nsaid anything nice. Why? Tell me."\r\n\r\nAs he gave no answer, she made up her mind to leave the knot, and look\r\nat him.\r\n\r\n"Do you only love your engine?" she inquired. "People joke about it,\r\nyou know. They pretend you are always polishing, and making it shine,\r\nas though you had caresses for nothing else. If I tell you this, it is\r\nbecause I am your friend."\r\n\r\nHe looked at her, now, in the pale light of the fumy sky. And he\r\nremembered her when she was a child. Even then, she was violent and\r\nself-willed, but she sprang to his neck, as soon as he entered the\r\nhouse, with all the passionate impulse of a madcap. Later on, having\r\nfrequently lost sight of her, he had found her grown taller each time\r\nhe saw her. She continued to put her arms round his neck, troubling\r\nhim, more and more, by the flame of her great light eyes.\r\n\r\nShe was now a superb woman, and no doubt she had loved him a long\r\ntime--from childhood. His heart began to beat. A sudden sensation told\r\nhim that he was the one she awaited. He felt a swimming in the head,\r\nhis first impulse, in the anguish he experienced, was to flee. Love had\r\nalways made him mad, and he felt bent on murder.\r\n\r\n"What are you doing there, on your feet?" she resumed. "Why don\'t you\r\nsit down?"\r\n\r\nAgain he hesitated. Then, his legs suddenly becoming very tired, and\r\nhimself vanquished by the desire to try love once more, he sank down\r\nbeside her on the heap of cords. But he said nothing; his throat was\r\nquite dry. It was she, now, the proud, the silent one, who chattered\r\nmerrily until she lost breath, deafening herself with her own verbosity.\r\n\r\n"You see, the mistake mamma made was to marry Misard," she began.\r\n"He\'ll play her a nasty trick. I don\'t care a fig, because one has\r\nquite enough to do with one\'s own business. Don\'t you think so? And,\r\nbesides, mamma sends me off to bed as soon as I want to cut in. So she\r\nmust do the best she can by herself! I pass my time outside the house,\r\nI do. I am thinking of things for later on. Ah! you know, I saw you go\r\nby this morning, on your engine. Look! over there, from those bushes,\r\nwhere I was seated. But you, you never look--I\'ll tell you the things\r\nI\'m thinking of, but not now, later, when we have quite become good\r\nfriends."\r\n\r\nShe had let the scissors slip away from her, and he, still silent, had\r\ncaught hold of her two hands. Delighted, she abandoned them to him. But\r\nwhen he carried them to his burning lips, she gave an affrighted start.\r\nThe warrior woman awoke, prepared, and warlike.\r\n\r\n"No, no! Leave me alone!" she exclaimed. "I won\'t have it. Keep quiet.\r\nLet\'s talk."\r\n\r\nWithout heeding her, without hearing what she said, he grasped her\r\nbrutally in his arms, crushing her lips beneath his own. She uttered\r\na feeble cry, which was more like a moan, so deep, so sweet, that\r\nit revealed the tenderness she had so long concealed. Then, as he,\r\nbreathless, ceased his kisses and looked at her, he was all at once\r\nseized with frenzy, with such frightful ferocity, that he glanced round\r\nabout him in search of a weapon, a stone, something, in fact, to kill\r\nher with. His eyes fell upon the scissors, shining among the bits of\r\ncord. At a bound, he secured them, and he would have buried them in her\r\nbosom had not an icy chill brought him suddenly to his senses. Casting\r\nthe scissors from him, he fled, distracted, while she imagined he had\r\nleft her because she had resisted his caress.\r\n\r\nJacques fled in the melancholy night. He ascended at full speed a path\r\non the hillside, which brought him down to a little dale. The stones he\r\nscattered beneath his feet, alarmed him, and he tore off to the left\r\namong the bushes, there he bent round to the right, and came to a bare\r\nplateau. Abruptly descending from the high ground, he fell into the\r\nhedge bordering the line; a train flew along, roaring and flaming. At\r\nfirst he failed to understand what it could be, and felt terrified. Ah!\r\nyes, all this multitude that was passing, the continual flood, while he\r\nstood there in anguish!\r\n\r\nHe started off once more, climbing the hill and descending again. He\r\nnow constantly encountered the railway line, either at the bottom of\r\ndeep cuttings, resembling unfathomable depths, or else on embankments\r\nthat shut out the horizon with gigantic barricades. This desert\r\ncountry, broken up into hillocks, was like a labyrinth without issue,\r\nwhere he, in his folly, wheeled round and round in the mournful\r\ndesolation of the fallow land. And he had been beating up and down the\r\ninclines a long time, when before him he perceived the round opening,\r\nthe black jaw of the tunnel. An up-train plunged into it, howling and\r\nwhistling, leaving behind, when it had disappeared, absorbed by the\r\nearth, a prolonged concussion that made the ground quake.\r\n\r\nThen, Jacques, with weary feet fell down beside the line; and,\r\ngrovelling on the ground, his face buried in the long grass, he burst\r\ninto convulsive sobs. Great God! So this abominable complaint of\r\nwhich he fancied himself cured, had returned! He had wanted to murder\r\nthat girl. Kill a woman, kill a woman! This had been ringing in his\r\nears from his earliest youth. He could not deny that he had taken the\r\nscissors to stab her. And it was not because she had resisted his\r\nembrace. No; it was for the pleasure of the thing, because he had a\r\ndesire to do so, such a strong desire, that if he had not clutched the\r\ngrass, he would have returned there, as fast as he could, to butcher\r\nher. Her, great God! That Flore whom he had seen grow up, that wild\r\nchild by whom he had just felt himself so fondly loved! His twisted\r\nfingers tore the ground, his sobs rent his throat in a horrifying\r\nrattle of despair.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, he did his utmost to become calm. He wanted to understand\r\nit all. When he compared himself with others, how did he differ from\r\nthem? Down there at Plassans, in his youth, he had frequently asked\r\nhimself the same question. It is true that his mother Gervaise was\r\nvery young at the time of his birth, barely fifteen and a half; but\r\nhe was the second. She had only just entered her fourteenth year when\r\nhis elder brother Claude made his appearance; and neither Claude nor\r\nEtienne, who came later, seemed to suffer from having such a child\r\nfor a mother, or a father as young as herself--that handsome Lantier,\r\nwhose heartlessness was to cost Gervaise so many tears. Perhaps his\r\ntwo brothers also had his complaint, and said nothing about it.\r\nParticularly the elder one, who was dying with such incensement to\r\nbecome painter, that people said he had gone half crazy over his genius.\r\n\r\nThe family was not at all right, several of its members were wrong\r\nin the head. Himself, at certain hours, felt this hereditary flaw.\r\nNot that he had bad health, for it was only the apprehension and\r\nshame of his attacks that formerly had made him thin. But he was apt\r\nto suddenly lose his equilibrium, as if there existed broken places,\r\nholes in his being, by which his own self escaped from him amidst a\r\nsort of great cloud of smoke that disfigured everything. Then, losing\r\nhis self-control, he obeyed his muscles, listening to the mad animal\r\nwithin him. Nevertheless, he did not drink, he even deprived himself of\r\nan occasional dram of brandy, having remarked that the least drop of\r\nalcohol drove him mad. And he began to think that he must be paying for\r\nothers, the fathers, the grandfathers who had drunk, the generations of\r\ndrunkards, whose vitiated blood he had inherited. It seemed like slow\r\npoison, which reduced him to savagery, taking him back to the depths of\r\nthe woods, among the wolves, devourers of women.\r\n\r\nJacques had raised himself on an elbow, reflecting, watching the dark\r\nentrance to the tunnel. Heaving another great sob, he sank down again,\r\nrolling his head on the ground, crying out with grief. That girl, that\r\ngirl he had wanted to kill! The incident returned to him, acute and\r\nfrightful, as if the scissors had penetrated his own flesh.\r\n\r\nNo reasoning appeased him. He had wanted to kill her, he would kill\r\nher now, if she happened to be there. He remembered the first time the\r\ncomplaint had shown itself. He was barely sixteen, and one evening,\r\nwhile playing with a young girl, a relative, his junior by a couple\r\nof years, she happened to fall, and he at once sprang at her. In the\r\nfollowing year he recollected sharpening a knife to bury it in the neck\r\nof another girl, a little blonde, whom he noticed pass before his door\r\nevery morning. This one had a very fat, rosy neck, and he had already\r\nselected the place, a beauty spot under one of the ears. Then, there\r\nwere others, and others still, quite a procession of nightmares, all\r\nthose whom he had glanced at, with an abrupt desire to murder them.\r\nWomen he had brushed against in the street, women whom accident made\r\nhis neighbours, one particularly, a newly married bride seated beside\r\nhim at the theatre, who laughed very loud, and from whom he had to run\r\naway in the middle of an act, so as not to rip her open.\r\n\r\nAs he did not know them, why was he so furious against them? For,\r\neach occasion, it seemed like a sudden outburst of blind rage, an\r\never-recurring thirst to avenge some very ancient offences, the exact\r\nrecollection of which escaped him. Did it date from so far back, from\r\nthe harm women had done to his race, from the rancour laid up from male\r\nto male since the first deceptions at the bottom of the caverns? And,\r\nin his access, he also felt the necessity to fight, in order to conquer\r\nand subjugate the female, the perverted necessity to throw her dead on\r\nhis back, like a prey torn from others for ever. His head was bursting\r\nin the effort to understand. He could find no answer to his inquiry.\r\nToo ignorant, the brain too sluggish, thought he, in this anguish of a\r\nman urged to acts wherein his will stood for nothing, and the reason\r\nwhereof had disappeared from his mind.\r\n\r\nA train again passed by with the flash of its lights, and plunged\r\nlike a thunderbolt that roars and expires, into the mouth of the\r\ntunnel; and Jacques, as if this anonymous, indifferent, and hasty\r\ncrowd had been able to hear him, stood up, swallowing his sobs and\r\ntaking an innocent attitude. How many times at the end of one of his\r\nattacks, had he started thus, like the guilty, at the least sound? He\r\nonly lived tranquil and happy, when detached from the world on his\r\nlocomotive. When the engine bore him along in the trepidation of its\r\nwheels at express speed, when he had his hand on the reversing-wheel,\r\nand was entirely engaged in watching the metals and looking out for\r\nthe signals, he ceased thinking, and took deep draughts of the pure\r\nair, which always blew a gale. And this was why he was so fond of his\r\nengine.\r\n\r\nOn leaving the \xc3\x89cole des Arts et M\xc3\xa9tiers, he selected this occupation\r\nof engine-driver, notwithstanding his bright intelligence, for the\r\nsolitude and distraction it gave him. Without ambition, having in\r\nfour years attained the position of driver of the first class, he\r\nalready earned 2,800 frcs. a year, which, coupled with the gratuities\r\nhe received for economy in fuel and grease, brought the annual amount\r\nof his wages up to more than 4,000 frcs., and that satisfied him. He\r\nsaw his comrades of the second and third class, those instructed by\r\nthe company, the engine-fitters they took as pupils, he saw almost all\r\nof them marry work-girls, women who kept in the background, whom one\r\nonly occasionally caught sight of at the hour of departure, when they\r\nbrought the little baskets of provisions; while the ambitious comrades,\r\nparticularly those who came from a school, waited until they were heads\r\nof dep\xc3\xb4ts to get married, in the hope of meeting with someone of the\r\nmiddle class, a lady who wore a hat. For his part, he avoided women.\r\nWhat did he care? He would never marry. His only future was to roll\r\nalong alone, to roll along always, always, without stay.\r\n\r\nHis chiefs pointed him out as a model driver, who did not drink and\r\nwho did not run after petticoats. His tipsy comrades made fun of his\r\nexaggeration of good conduct, and the others were secretly alarmed when\r\nthey saw him fall into his silent, melancholy fits, with eyes dim and\r\nashy countenance. How many hours did he recollect having passed, all\r\nthose hours of freedom, shut up like a monk in his cell, in that little\r\nroom in the Rue Cardinet, whence the dep\xc3\xb4t at Batignolles, to which his\r\nengine belonged, could be seen.\r\n\r\nJacques made an effort to rise. What was he doing there in the grass,\r\non this mild and hazy winter night? The country remained plunged in\r\nshadow. There was only light above, where the moon lit up the thin\r\nfog, the immense ground-glass-like cupola which concealed it from\r\nview, with a pale yellow reflex. Below, the black earth slumbered in\r\nthe immobility of death. Come! it must be near nine o\'clock. The best\r\nthing to do would be to return to the house, and go to bed. But, in his\r\ntorpor, he saw himself back at the Misards, ascending the staircase to\r\nthe loft, stretching himself on the hay against the plank partition\r\nseparating him from the room occupied by Flore. She would be there, he\r\nwould hear her breathing; and, as he was aware that she never locked\r\nher door, he would be able to join her. His shivering fit returned. He\r\nwas racked again with such a violent sob at the image of this girl,\r\nthat he once more sank to the ground.\r\n\r\nHe had wanted to kill her--wanted to kill her! Great God! He was\r\nchoking in anguish at the thought that he would go and kill her in her\r\nbed, presently, if he returned to the house. He might well be without\r\na weapon; he might cover his head with his two arms to render himself\r\npowerless, but he felt that the male, independent of his own will,\r\nwould thrust open the door and strangle the girl, urged to the crime by\r\na thirst to avenge the ancient wrong. No, no! He had better pass the\r\nnight beating about the neighbourhood, than return there. Bounding to\r\nhis feet he fled again.\r\n\r\nThen, once more, for half an hour, he tore across the dark country\r\nas if an unchained pack of devils followed howling at his heels. He\r\nascended the hills, he plunged down into the narrow gorges. He went\r\nthrough two streams, one after the other, drenching himself to the\r\nhips. A bush, barring his progress, exasperated him. His only thought\r\nwas to go straight on, further, still further, to flee, to flee from\r\nthe other one, the mad animal he felt within him; but the beast\r\naccompanied him, it flew along as fast as he did. For months he had\r\nfancied he had driven it from him; he had pursued the same life as\r\nother people; and, now, he had to begin again, he would have to resume\r\nthe struggle to prevent the brute leaping upon the first woman he\r\nchanced to brush against in the street.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the intense silence and vast solitude appeased him\r\na little, and made him dream of a life as mute and lonely as this\r\ndesolate land, where he would stroll about always, without ever meeting\r\na soul. He must have turned round without noticing it, for he found\r\nhimself kicking against the metals on the opposite side of the line,\r\nafter describing a wide circle among the slopes, bristling with bushes,\r\nabove the tunnel. He started back in the irritable uneasiness of once\r\nmore falling upon the living. Then, with the intention of taking a\r\nshort cut behind a hillock, he lost his way, to find it again before\r\nthe railway hedge, just at the exit from the tunnel on the down-line,\r\nopposite the field where he had been sobbing a short time previously;\r\nand, tired to death, he remained motionless, when the thunder of a\r\ntrain issuing from the bowels of the earth, at first slight, but\r\nbecoming louder and louder every second, attracted his attention. It\r\nwas the Havre express which had left Paris at 6.30 and passed by there\r\nat 9.25; the train he drove every two days.\r\n\r\nJacques first of all saw the dark mouth of the tunnel lit up, like the\r\nopening to an oven ablaze with faggots. Then the engine burst out with\r\na tremendous crash amidst the dazzling splendour of its great round eye\r\nthe lantern in front whose fire bored into the country, illuminating\r\nthe metals for a long way ahead, with a double line of flame. It came\r\nlike a thunderbolt; the carriages followed one another immediately\r\nafterwards, the small square windows of the doors, brilliant with\r\nluminosity, displayed compartments full of travellers, flying past at\r\nsuch a whirling speed, that there afterwards remained a doubt in the\r\nmind of the spectator, as to what the eye had seen.\r\n\r\nAnd Jacques, very distinctly, at that precise quarter of a second,\r\nperceived through the flaming glass of a coup\xc3\xa9 window, one man holding\r\nanother down on the seat, and plunging a knife into his throat; while\r\na dark heap, perhaps a third person, perhaps some articles of luggage\r\nfallen from the rack, weighed with all its weight on the convulsed\r\nlegs of the victim. But the train had already dashed past, and was\r\ndisappearing in the direction of La Croix-de-Maufras, displaying naught\r\nof itself in the dense obscurity, but the three lights at the back--the\r\nred triangle.\r\n\r\nThe young man, riveted to the spot, followed the train with his eyes\r\nas its thunder gradually died away, leaving the deathlike peacefulness\r\nof the surroundings undisturbed. Was he sure he had seen what he\r\nthought? And now he hesitated. He no longer dared affirm the reality\r\nof this vision which came and went in a flash. Not one single feature\r\nof the two actors in the drama remained vivid. The dark heap must have\r\nbeen a travelling-rug that had fallen across the body of the victim.\r\nNevertheless, he thought he had first of all caught sight of a pale\r\nprofile beneath waves of thick hair. But all this became confused, and\r\nevaporated as in a dream. For an instant, the profile he had evoked\r\nreappeared, and then definitely vanished. Doubtless it was nothing more\r\nthan imagination; and all this gave him an icy chill. It seemed to\r\nhim so extraordinary, that at last he admitted he must have been the\r\nvictim of hallucination, due to the frightful crisis he had just passed\r\nthrough.\r\n\r\nJacques walked about for nearly another hour, his head loaded with\r\nconfused thoughts. He felt broken down, but relief came, and his fever\r\nleft him. He ended by turning in the direction of La Croix-de-Maufras,\r\nbut without having decided to do so. Then when he found himself before\r\nthe house of the gatekeeper, he was determined he would not go in,\r\nthat he would sleep in the little shed built against one of the walls.\r\nBut a ray of light passed under the door, and pushing it open, without\r\ngiving a thought to what he was doing, a strange sight stopped him on\r\nthe threshold.\r\n\r\nMisard had disturbed the butter-jar in the corner, and, on the ground\r\non all fours, a lighted lantern beside him, he was sounding the wall\r\nwith little taps of the knuckle, searching. The noise made by the door\r\nopening, made him stand up, but he did not show the least confusion. He\r\nmerely remarked in the most natural tone of voice imaginable:\r\n\r\n"Some matches have fallen down."\r\n\r\nAnd when he had put the butter-jar back in its place, he added:\r\n\r\n"I came to fetch my lantern, because a little while ago, as I came\r\nalong, I perceived a man stretched across the line, and I believe he\'s\r\ndead."\r\n\r\nJacques, at first struck at the idea of surprising Misard searching\r\nfor the hoard of Aunt Phasie, which abruptly transformed his doubt\r\nrespecting the accusations of the latter into certainty, was then so\r\nviolently upset by this news of the discovery of a corpse, that he\r\nforgot the other drama--the one that was being performed there, in\r\nthis little out-of-the-way dwelling. The scene in the coup\xc3\xa9, the brief\r\nvision of one man slaughtering another, returned to him in a vivid\r\nflash.\r\n\r\n"A man on the line!" he exclaimed, turning pale. "Where?"\r\n\r\nMisard was about to relate that he was returning with a couple of eels\r\nwhich he had taken from his ground lines, and that he had first of all\r\nrun home, as fast as he could, to hide them. But he reflected that\r\nthere was no necessity to confide in this young man, and with a vague\r\ngesture he replied:\r\n\r\n"Over there, about half a mile away. It requires a light to find out\r\nmore."\r\n\r\nAt this moment Jacques heard a thud overhead. He was so nervous that he\r\nstarted.\r\n\r\n"It\'s nothing," said Misard. "It\'s only Flore moving."\r\n\r\nAnd, in fact, the young man recognised the pit-pat of two naked feet on\r\nthe floor. She had come to listen at the half-open door.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll go with you," Jacques resumed. "Are you sure he\'s dead?"\r\n\r\n"Well, he looked like it," answered the other. "We shall soon see with\r\nthe lantern."\r\n\r\n"What\'s your opinion?" inquired Jacques. "An accident?"\r\n\r\n"Maybe," replied Misard. "Some chap who\'s got cut in two, or perhaps a\r\npassenger who jumped out of a carriage."\r\n\r\nJacques shuddered.\r\n\r\n"Come along quick, quick!" he exclaimed.\r\n\r\nNever had he been agitated with such a fever to see and know. Outside\r\nthe house, while his companion, without any concern, walked along the\r\nline swinging his lantern, he ran on ahead, irritated at the delay.\r\nIt was like a physical desire, the fire within that precipitates the\r\nsteps of lovers at the hour of meeting. He feared what awaited him\r\nyonder, and yet he flew there with all the muscles of his limbs. When\r\nhe reached the spot, when he almost stumbled over a dark heap lying\r\nnear the down-line, he remained planted where he stood with a shiver\r\nrunning from his heels to the nape of his neck. And, his anguish at\r\nbeing unable to see distinctly, turned to oaths against the other, who\r\nwas loitering along, thirty paces behind.\r\n\r\n"Come on, come on!" he shouted. "If he\'s still alive, we may be able to\r\ndo something for him."\r\n\r\nMisard waddled forward in his sluggish way. Then, when he had swung the\r\nlantern to and fro, over the body, he muttered:\r\n\r\n"Ah! the devil take me! It\'s all up with him."\r\n\r\nThe man, no doubt tumbling out of a carriage, had fallen with his\r\nface downwards, a couple of feet at the most from the metals. Nothing\r\ncould be seen of his head but a crown of thick black hair. His legs\r\nwere apart. His right arm lay as if dislocated, while his left was\r\nbent under his chest. He was very well attired in a big, blue cloth\r\novercoat, neat boots, and fine linen. The body bore no trace of having\r\nbeen crushed, but a quantity of blood had run from the throat, and\r\nsoiled the shirt collar.\r\n\r\n"Some gentleman whom they\'ve done for," tranquilly resumed Misard,\r\nafter a few seconds\' silent inspection. Then, turning towards Jacques,\r\nwho stood motionless and thunderstruck, he continued:\r\n\r\n"He must not be touched. It\'s forbidden. You will have to remain here,\r\nand watch over him, while I go to Barentin to tell the station-master\r\nabout it."\r\n\r\nHe raised his lantern, and looked at a mile-post.\r\n\r\n"Good!" said he. "Just at post 153." And, placing his lantern on the\r\nground beside the corpse, he took himself off at his usual loitering\r\ngait.\r\n\r\nJacques, left by himself, did not move, but continued gazing at this\r\ninert mass that had fallen there, and which the uncertain light, just\r\nabove the ground, only revealed indistinctly. The agitation that had\r\nmade him rush forward, the horrible attraction that held him there,\r\nended in this keen thought which burst from all his being: the other\r\none, the man he had caught sight of with the knife in his hand had\r\ndared! He had gratified his desire! He had killed. Ah! what would he\r\ngive not to be a coward, to be able to satisfy himself at last, to\r\nplunge in the knife! He, who had been tortured by this thirst for ten\r\nyears!\r\n\r\nIn his fever, he felt contempt for himself, and admiration for the\r\nother; and, above all, he felt the necessity to gaze on the victim, the\r\nquenchless thirst to feast his eyes on this human remnant, this broken\r\ndancing-Jack, this limp rag, which the stab of a knife had made of a\r\ncreature. What he dreamed of, the other had realised, and it was that.\r\nIf he killed, he would have that on the ground. His heart beat fit to\r\nbreak. His prurience for murder became violent as concupiscence, at the\r\nsight of this tragic corpse. He took a step, approached nearer, after\r\nthe manner of a child making himself familiar with an object he fears.\r\nYes, he would dare, he would dare in his turn!\r\n\r\nBut a roar behind his back, made him spring aside. A train arrived\r\nwhich he had not heard, being so taken up with the contemplation of the\r\nbody. He would have been crushed to pieces had not the warm steam and\r\nthe formidable puffing of the engine warned him in time. The train flew\r\npast in its hurricane of noise, smoke, and flame. This one also carried\r\na great many people. The flood of travellers continued streaming\r\ntowards Havre, for the f\xc3\xaate on the morrow. A child was flattening his\r\nnose against a window, looking out at the black country; profiles of\r\nmen appeared, while a young woman, lowering one of the glasses, threw\r\nout a paper stained with butter and sugar. Already the joyous train\r\nwas flying away in the distance, listless of the corpse its wheels\r\nhad almost grazed. And the body continued lying there on its face,\r\nindistinctly lit up by the lantern, amidst the melancholy peacefulness\r\nof night.\r\n\r\nThen Jacques had a desire to see the wound, while he was alone. But\r\nhe hesitated, in the anxiety that if he touched the head, it would,\r\nperhaps, be noticed. He reckoned that Misard could not be back with the\r\nstation-master before three-quarters of an hour; and as the minutes\r\npassed, he thought of this Misard, of this puny fellow, so slow, so\r\ncalm, who also dared, who was killing as tranquilly as possible, with\r\ndoses of poison. Then it was easy enough to kill? Everybody killed. He\r\ndrew nearer the corpse, and the idea of looking at the wound stung him\r\nso sharply that he was burning all over. He wanted to see how it had\r\nbeen done, and what had run from it, to see the red hole! By carefully\r\nputting the head back into its position, nobody would know anything\r\nabout it. But at the bottom of his hesitation was another fear which he\r\nhad not owned, the dread of blood. He had still a quarter of an hour to\r\nhimself, and he was on the point of making up his mind to look, when a\r\nslight sound beside him, made him start.\r\n\r\nIt was Flore, standing gazing at the corpse like himself. She was keen\r\non accidents; as soon as ever the news arrived that an animal had been\r\npounded to atoms, or a man cut in two by a train, she hurried to the\r\nscene of disaster. She had just dressed again, and wanted to see the\r\ncorpse. Unlike Jacques, she did not hesitate. After a first glance, she\r\nstooped down, raising the lantern with one hand, while with the other\r\nshe took the head, and threw it back.\r\n\r\n"Mind what you\'re doing," murmured Jacques; "it\'s forbidden."\r\n\r\nBut she shrugged her shoulders. The face appeared in the yellow light,\r\nthe face of an old man, with a large nose and the blue, wide-open eyes\r\nof one formerly fair. A frightful wound was gaping beneath the chin.\r\nThe throat had been cut with a deep, jagged gash, as if the knife\r\nhad been twisted round probing it. The right side of the chest was\r\ndrenched in blood. On the left, in the button-hole of the great coat,\r\nthe rosette of Commander of the Legion of Honour looked like a clot of\r\nblood that had spurted there.\r\n\r\nFlore uttered an exclamation of surprise.\r\n\r\n"Hullo! the old man!" said she.\r\n\r\nJacques advanced, bending forward as she was doing, mingling his hair\r\nwith her hair, to see better. He was choking, gorging himself with the\r\nsight. Unconsciously he repeated:\r\n\r\n"The old man? The old man?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, old Grandmorin, the President."\r\n\r\nFor another moment she examined this livid face, with the distorted\r\nmouth and the great, terrifying eyes. Then she let go the head, which\r\nwas beginning to turn icy cold in cadaverous rigidity, and the wound\r\nclosed.\r\n\r\n"He\'s done larking with the girls!" she resumed in a lower tone. "It\'s\r\ngot something to do with one of them, for sure. Ah! my poor Louisette!\r\nAh! the pig! Serve him right!"\r\n\r\nA long silence ensued. Flore, who had set down the lantern, waited,\r\nslowly casting glances at Jacques, while he, separated from her by\r\nthe corpse, did not move. He seemed as if lost, completely prostrated\r\nby what he had just seen. It must have been eleven o\'clock. The\r\nembarrassment due to the scene in the evening prevented him speaking\r\nthe first. But a sound of voices was heard. It was her stepfather\r\nreturning with the station-master, and, not wishing to be seen, she\r\nmade up her mind to break the ice.\r\n\r\n"Aren\'t you going back to bed?" she inquired.\r\n\r\nHe started, and seemed agitated by an inner struggle. Then, with an\r\neffort, with a recoil full of despair, he answered:\r\n\r\n"No, no!"\r\n\r\nShe made no movement, but her look, with her robust arms hanging\r\ndown beside her, expressed great sorrow. As if to ask pardon for her\r\nresistance of a short time before she became very humble, and added:\r\n\r\n"Then if you are not going back to the house, I shall not see you\r\nagain?"\r\n\r\n"No, no!" he replied.\r\n\r\nThe voices approached, and without seeking to press his hand, as he\r\nseemed to purposely place this corpse between them, without even giving\r\nhim the familiar good-bye of their comradeship of childhood, she\r\nwithdrew, disappearing in the darkness, and breathing hard, as if to\r\nstifle her sobs.\r\n\r\nThe station-master appeared on the scene almost at once, along with\r\nMisard and a couple of porters. He also proved the identity: it was\r\nPresident Grandmorin sure enough. He knew him by seeing him get down\r\nat his station each time he went to Madame Bonnehon, at Doinville. The\r\nbody could remain where it had fallen, but he would have it covered\r\nwith the cloak a man had brought with him. One of the staff had\r\ntaken the eleven o\'clock train at Barentin to inform the Imperial\r\nProcurator at Rouen. But they could not count on the latter before\r\nfive or six o\'clock in the morning, for he would have to bring the\r\nexamining-magistrate, the registrar of the Court, and a doctor with\r\nhim. And so the station-master arranged for the body to be guarded. The\r\nmen would take turns throughout the night, one man being constantly\r\nthere on the watch, with the lantern.\r\n\r\nAnd Jacques, before making up his mind to go and stretch himself\r\nunder some shed at the Barentin station, whence he would not set\r\nout for Havre before 7.20, remained for a long time where he stood,\r\nmotionless, and worried. Then he became troubled at the idea of the\r\nexamining-magistrate who was expected, as if he felt himself an\r\naccomplice. Should he say what he had seen as the train went by? At\r\nfirst he resolved to speak, as, after all, he had nothing to fear.\r\nMoreover, there could be no doubt as to his duty. But, then, he asked\r\nhimself, what was the good of it? he could not bring one single,\r\ndecisive fact to bear on the matter, he would not dare affirm any\r\ndetail respecting the murderer. It would be idiotic to mix himself up\r\nin the business, to lose his time, and worry himself, without profit to\r\nanyone.\r\n\r\nNo, no, he would say nothing! At last, he took himself off, but he\r\nturned round twice, to see the black heap the body made on the ground,\r\nin the circle of yellow light shed by the lantern. Sharper cold fell\r\nfrom the fumy sky, on the desolation of this desert with arid hills.\r\nMore trains had passed. Another, a very long one, arrived for Paris.\r\nAll crossed in their inexorable mechanic might, flying to their distant\r\ngoal, to the future, almost grazing, without taking heed of it, the\r\nhalf-severed head of this man whom another man had slaughtered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following day, a Sunday, five o\'clock in the morning had just\r\nstruck from all the belfries of Havre, when Roubaud came down under\r\nthe iron marquee of the station, to resume duty. It was still pitch\r\ndark; but the wind, blowing from the sea, had increased, and drove\r\nalong the haze, smothering the hills which extend from Sainte-Adresse\r\nto Tourneville; while westward, above the offing, appeared a bright\r\nopening, a strip of sky, where shone the last stars. The gas-lamps\r\nunder the marquee were still alight, but looking pale in the damp\r\nchill of this matutinal hour. Shunters were engaged in making-up the\r\nfirst train for Montivilliers, under the orders of the assistant\r\nstation-master on night duty. The doors of the waiting-rooms had not\r\nyet been opened, and the platforms stretched forward, deserted, in this\r\ndrowsy awakening of the station.\r\n\r\nAs Roubaud left his apartments, upstairs, over the waiting-rooms, he\r\nfound Madame Lebleu, the wife of the cashier, standing motionless\r\nin the middle of the central corridor, on which the lodgings of the\r\nmembers of the staff opened. For weeks past this lady had been in the\r\nhabit of getting up during the night to watch Mademoiselle Guichon,\r\nthe office-keeper, whom she suspected of carrying on an intrigue with\r\nM. Dabadie, the station-master. As a matter of fact, she had never\r\nsurprised the least thing, not a shadow, not a breath. And, again on\r\nthis particular morning, she had quickly returned to her own quarters,\r\ntaking no news back with her, save the expression of her astonishment\r\nat what she had caught sight of in the rooms occupied by the Roubauds,\r\nduring the two or three seconds the husband had required to open and\r\nshut the door. There she had seen the beautiful S\xc3\xa9verine, who was in\r\nthe habit of lying abed until nine o\'clock in the morning, standing\r\nup in the dining-room dressed, combed, and booted. And she had roused\r\nLebleu to tell him of this extraordinary occurrence.\r\n\r\nOn the previous night they sat up until the arrival of the Paris\r\nexpress at 11.05, burning to learn what had become of the affair with\r\nthe sub-prefect. But they were unable to read anything in the attitude\r\nof the Roubauds, who returned with faces wearing their everyday\r\nexpression; and in vain did they listen until midnight: not a sound\r\ncame from the rooms occupied by their neighbours, who must have gone\r\nto bed at once, and fallen fast asleep. Their journey could certainly\r\nnot have been attended with a good result, otherwise S\xc3\xa9verine would\r\nnot have risen at such an early hour. The cashier having inquired how\r\nshe looked, his wife had been at pains to describe her: very stiff,\r\nvery pale, with her great blue eyes appearing so bright against her\r\nblack hair; she was standing quite still, and had the aspect of a\r\nsomnambulist. But they would find out all about it in the course of the\r\nday.\r\n\r\nDown below, Roubaud found his colleague Moulin, who had been on duty\r\nduring the night; and as he took over the service, Moulin walked along\r\nwith him for a minute or two, posting him up in the few small events\r\nthat had occurred since the previous evening: some vagrants had been\r\nsurprised as they were effecting an entrance into the cloakroom; three\r\nporters had been reprimanded for indiscipline; a coupling-hook had\r\njust broken while the Montivilliers train was being made-up. Roubaud\r\nlistened in silence, and with calm countenance. He was only a trifle\r\npale, due no doubt to a remainder of fatigue, which was also visible\r\nin his heavy eyes. When his colleague ceased speaking, he still seemed\r\nto look at him inquiringly, as if he expected something more. But what\r\nhe had heard was all, and he bent his head, gazing for an instant on\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\nAs the two men walked along the platform they reached the end of the\r\ncorrugated iron roofing, and on the right stood a coach-house where the\r\ncarriages in constant use remained, such as came in one day, and served\r\nto make up the trains on the morrow. Roubaud raised his head, and was\r\nlooking fixedly at a first-class carriage with a coup\xc3\xa9, bearing the\r\nNo. 293, which as it happened a gas-lamp lit up with its vacillating\r\nglimmer, when Moulin remarked:\r\n\r\n"Ah! I forgot----"\r\n\r\nThe pale face of the other coloured, and he was unable to restrain a\r\nslight movement.\r\n\r\n"I forgot," repeated Moulin; "that carriage must not leave. Do not put\r\nit on the 6.40 express this morning."\r\n\r\nA short silence ensued before Roubaud, in a very natural voice said:\r\n\r\n"Indeed! Why is that?"\r\n\r\n"Because," replied Moulin, "a coup\xc3\xa9 has been booked for the express of\r\nthis evening. We are not sure that one will come in during the day, so\r\nwe may just as well keep this one."\r\n\r\n"Certainly," replied Roubaud, staring at his colleague.\r\n\r\nBut he was absorbed by another thought, and all at once, flying into a\r\nrage, he exclaimed:\r\n\r\n"It\'s disgusting! Just see how those fellows do the cleaning! That\r\ncarriage looks as if it had the accumulated dust of a week on it."\r\n\r\n"Ah!" resumed Moulin. "When trains arrive after eleven o\'clock at\r\nnight, there is no fear of the men giving the coaches a brush up. It\'s\r\nas much as they will do to cast a glance inside of them. The other\r\nnight, they overlooked a passenger asleep on one of the seats, and he\r\nonly awoke the next morning."\r\n\r\nThen, stifling a yawn, he said he was going up to bed. But as he went\r\noff, an abrupt feeling of curiosity brought him back.\r\n\r\n"By the way, what about your affair with the sub-prefect?" he inquired.\r\n"It\'s all settled, I suppose?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes," answered Roubaud. "I made a very good journey. I\'m quite\r\nsatisfied."\r\n\r\n"Well, so much the better. And bear in mind that the 293 does not\r\nstart," replied the other.\r\n\r\nWhen Roubaud found himself alone on the platform, he slowly went back\r\ntowards the Montivilliers train, which was ready. The doors of the\r\nwaiting-rooms were open, and some passengers appeared: a few sportsmen\r\nwith their dogs, and two or three families of shop-keepers, taking\r\nadvantage of the Sunday--only a few people altogether. But when that\r\ntrain had gone, the first of the day, Roubaud had not much time to\r\nlose. He immediately had to make up the 5.40 slow train for Rouen and\r\nParis.\r\n\r\nAt this early hour not many servants of the company were about; and the\r\nwork of the assistant station-master on duty, was complicated by all\r\nsorts of details. When he had superintended the making-up of the train,\r\nconsisting in each carriage being taken from the coach-house and placed\r\non a truck, which a gang of men pushed along under the marquee, he had\r\nto run off to the main building, to give a glance at the ticket office,\r\nand the luggage booking department. A quarrel breaking out between\r\nsome soldiers and one of the staff, necessitated his intervention. For\r\nhalf an hour, in the icy draughts, amid the shivering public, his eyes\r\nstill heavy with sleep, and in the ill-humour of a man jostled at every\r\nmoment in the obscurity, he hurried hither and thither without a moment\r\nto himself. Then, when the departure of the slow train had cleared the\r\nstation, he hastened to the box of the pointsman, to make sure that\r\nall was right in that quarter. For the through train from Paris, which\r\nwas behind time, was coming in. He returned to the platform to see the\r\nstream of passengers leave the carriages, give up their tickets, and\r\ncrowd into the omnibuses from the hotels, which in those days entered\r\nthe station, to wait under the marquee, where they were separated\r\nfrom the line by a mere paling. And then, only, did he find leisure\r\nto breathe for a moment, the station having again become silent and\r\ndeserted.\r\n\r\nSix o\'clock struck. Roubaud sauntered out of the main building; and,\r\nbeyond, with space before him, he raised his head and inhaled the\r\nfresh air, watching day at last breaking. The wind from the offing had\r\ncompletely driven away the mist. It was the clear morning of a fine\r\nday. He looked northward, in the direction of Ingouville, as far as the\r\ntrees of the cemetery, standing out in a violescent line against the\r\nwhitening sky. Then, turning towards the south and west, he observed a\r\nfinal flight of light white clouds floating slowly along in a squadron\r\nacross the sea; while the entire east, the immense opening formed by\r\nthe mouth of the Seine, began to be embraced in approaching sunrise.\r\n\r\nIn a casual way, he removed his cap, embroidered with silver, as\r\nif to refresh his forehead in the sharp, pure air. This outlook to\r\nwhich he was accustomed, this vast flat sweep of dependencies of the\r\nstation--the arrival on the left, then the engine dep\xc3\xb4t, to the right\r\nthe departure, a regular little town--seemed to appease him, to bring\r\nhim back to the calmness of his daily occupations which were ever the\r\nsame. Factory chimneys were smoking above the wall of the Rue Charles\r\nLafitte; and enormous heaps of coal could be seen following the line\r\nof the Vauban basin. A hum already began to rise from the other docks.\r\nThe whistling of the goods trains, the awakening of the town, the briny\r\nsmell of the sea wafted by the wind, made him think of the f\xc3\xaate of the\r\nday, of this vessel they were about to launch, and around which the\r\ncrowd would be crushing.\r\n\r\nRoubaud, returning inside the station, found the gang of shunters\r\ncommencing to make up the 6.40 express; and thinking the men were\r\nputting No. 293 on the truck, all the calm that the fresh morning air\r\nhad brought him, disappeared in a sudden burst of anger. With an oath\r\nhe shouted:\r\n\r\n"Not that carriage! Leave it alone! It is not to go till to-night."\r\n\r\nThe foreman of the gang explained to him that they were merely pushing\r\nthe carriage along, to take another from behind it. But, deafened by\r\nhis own passion, which was out of all proportion, he did not hear.\r\n\r\n"You clumsy idiots!" he exclaimed; "when you are told to leave the\r\nthing alone, do so!"\r\n\r\nHaving at length been made to understand, he continued, furious,\r\nturning his wrath against the inconvenience of the station, where\r\nit was not even possible to turn a carriage round. In fact, the\r\nstation, one of the first built on the line, was not equal to modern\r\nrequirements. It was unworthy of Havre, with its old timber coach-house\r\nglazed with small panes of glass, and its dismal, naked buildings full\r\nof cracks.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a disgrace. I can\'t comprehend why the company has not knocked it\r\nall down."\r\n\r\nThe shunters looked at him, surprised to hear him speak so freely, he\r\nwho was generally so well disciplined. Perceiving their attitude, he\r\nall at once ceased his remarks, and, silent and stiff, continued to\r\nwatch the man\xc5\x93uvres. A line of discontent furrowed his low forehead,\r\nwhile his round, coloured face, bristling with the reddish beard, took\r\nan expression of intensely strong will.\r\n\r\nFrom that moment, Roubaud was in possession of all his equanimity. He\r\ngave active attention to the express, busying himself with every detail\r\nconnected with it. The couplings appearing to him to be badly attached,\r\nhe insisted on having them screwed up before his eyes. A mother and\r\ntwo daughters, on terms of intimacy with his wife, wanted him to seat\r\nthem in the compartment for ladies only. Then, before whistling to give\r\nthe signal to start, he again made sure that the train was in perfect\r\ntrim; and he stood watching it, as it moved away, with that clear gaze\r\nof a man whose least carelessness might involve the loss of human lives.\r\n\r\nHe had at once to cross the line, to be present at the arrival of a\r\ntrain from Rouen, which was just entering the station. There he met a\r\nman from the Post Office, with whom he every day exchanged news. This\r\nwas a short rest for him in his busy early hours, and as no immediate\r\nduty required his attention, he had time to draw breath. On this\r\nmorning, as was his habit, he rolled a cigarette, and chatted gaily.\r\nDay had broadened, and the gas-lamps under the marquee, had just been\r\nextinguished; but the glazing of this extension of the station was so\r\nbad, that the light continued gloomy. Outside, the vast stretch of\r\nsky on which the building opened, was already ablaze with a fire of\r\nsun-rays; while the entire view became rosy, and the smallest objects\r\nstood out crisp, in this pure air of a fine winter morning.\r\n\r\nM. Dabadie, the station-master, usually came down from his rooms at\r\neight o\'clock, when the assistant station-master went to him to make\r\nhis report. The former was a handsome man, very dark, neat in his\r\nattire, with the bearing of a commercial magnate engrossed in business.\r\nIndeed, he willingly left the passenger department of the station to\r\nhis assistants, so that he might give particular attention to the\r\nmovement in the docks, to the enormous transit of merchandise; and he\r\nwas in constant contact with the high commerce of Havre, and of the\r\nentire world. To-day he came late. Roubaud had already pushed the door\r\nof his office ajar twice, without finding him. On the table lay his\r\nletters, which had not even been opened. Among them Roubaud had just\r\nnoticed a telegram. Then, as if drawn to the spot by fascination, he\r\nhad been unable to leave the threshold, returning, in spite of himself,\r\nto cast rapid glances at the table.\r\n\r\nAt last, at ten minutes past eight, M. Dabadie appeared. Roubaud seated\r\nhimself without speaking, to allow him to open the telegram. But the\r\nchief was in no hurry. Wishing to be pleasant with his subordinate,\r\nwhom he esteemed, he said:\r\n\r\n"I suppose all went well in Paris?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir, I thank you," replied Roubaud.\r\n\r\nHe had ended by opening the telegram; but he did not read it. He\r\ncontinued smiling at his assistant, whose voice thickened in the\r\nviolent effort he was making to get the better of a nervous twitch\r\ncontracting his chin.\r\n\r\n"We are very pleased to keep you here," said the station-master.\r\n\r\n"And I, sir, am very glad to remain with you," answered Roubaud.\r\n\r\nThen, as M. Dabadie made up his mind to run his eye over the telegram,\r\nRoubaud, who felt a slight perspiration moistening his face, watched\r\nhim. But the agitation which he expected to see on the countenance of\r\nhis chief, did not appear. The latter placidly continued perusing the\r\ntelegram, which he eventually threw back on the table. No doubt it had\r\nto do with a simple detail connected with the service. He at once began\r\nto open his letters, while his assistant, in accordance with daily\r\ncustom, made his verbal report on the events of the night and morning.\r\nOnly, on this occasion, Roubaud hesitated, and had to think before he\r\ncould recall what his colleague had told him about the vagrants caught\r\nin the cloakroom. A few more words were exchanged, and when the two\r\ndeputy chiefs of the docks and slow train departments came in, also to\r\nmake their reports, the station-master dismissed Roubaud by a gesture.\r\nThe newcomers brought another telegram, which one of the staff had\r\njust handed them on the platform.\r\n\r\n"You can go," said M. Dabadie to Roubaud, seeing he had stopped at the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nBut the latter waited with fixed, expectant eyes; and he only went away\r\nwhen the small piece of paper had fallen on the table, put aside with\r\nthe same indifferent gesture as before. For a few moments, he wandered\r\nunder the marquee, feeling perplexed and dizzy. The clock pointed to\r\n8.35. The next departure was the slow train at 9.50. He usually took\r\nadvantage of this hour of rest, to stroll round the station, and he\r\nnow walked about for a few minutes without knowing where his feet were\r\ntaking him. Then, as he raised his head, and found himself opposite the\r\ncarriage numbered 293, he abruptly turned aside in the direction of the\r\nengine-house, although he had nothing to attend to in that quarter. The\r\nsun was now rising on the horizon, filling the air with golden dust.\r\nBut he no longer enjoyed the fine morning. He hastened along as if very\r\nmuch occupied, endeavouring to overcome the uneasiness caused by the\r\nsuspense.\r\n\r\nAll at once a voice stopped him.\r\n\r\n"Good morning, M. Roubaud! Did you see my wife?"\r\n\r\nIt was Pecqueux, the fireman, a great, thin fellow of three-and-forty,\r\nwith big bones, and a face tanned by fire and smoke. His grey eyes,\r\nunder a low forehead, his great mouth, set in a prominent jaw, had the\r\nconstant, jovial expression of a man addicted to merry-making.\r\n\r\n"What! Is that you?" said Roubaud, stopping astonished. "Ah! yes. Your\r\nengine met with an accident. I forgot. And so you\'re not going off\r\nagain until to-night? Twenty-four hours\' holiday. Good business, eh?"\r\n\r\n"Good business!" repeated the other, not yet recovered from his\r\nlibations of the previous evening.\r\n\r\nBorn at a village near Rouen, he had entered the service of the company\r\nquite young, as engine-fitter. Then, at thirty, tired of the workshop,\r\nhe had wanted to be a fireman so as to become driver. It was then that\r\nhe married Victoire, who belonged to the same village as himself. But\r\nyears went by, and he continued fireman. He would never become driver\r\nnow, being of bad conduct, careless in dress and mode of life, a\r\ndrunkard, and a runner after petticoats. He would have been dismissed\r\ntwenty times over, had it not been for the protection of President\r\nGrandmorin, and had not his superiors become accustomed to his vices,\r\nfor which he condoned by his good humour, and his experience as an\r\nold workman. He only gave cause for alarm when under the influence of\r\ndrink, for he then became a real brute, capable of any violence.\r\n\r\n"Did you see my wife?" he inquired again, with a broad grin.\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed," answered the assistant station-master; "we saw her.\r\nWe even had a very nice lunch in your room. Ah! you\'ve a good wife,\r\nPecqueux; and it\'s wrong of you to be unfaithful to her."\r\n\r\nHe gave a broader grin than before.\r\n\r\n"Oh! how can you say such a thing?" he exclaimed. "It\'s she who wants\r\nme to enjoy myself!"\r\n\r\nThis was true. Victoire, who was two years his senior, and who had\r\ngrown enormously stout, was in the habit of slipping five-franc pieces\r\ninto his pocket, so that he might amuse himself when away. She had\r\nnever suffered much from his infidelity; and, now, their mode of life\r\nwas settled. He had two wives, one at each end of the line. Victoire,\r\nwho knew everything, accepted the position, and even went so far as to\r\nmend his linen, in order that the other one might not be able to say\r\nthat she allowed their husband to go about in rags and tatters.\r\n\r\n"No matter," resumed Roubaud, "it\'s not at all nice on your part. My\r\nwife, who is very fond of her foster-mother, wants to scold you."\r\n\r\nBut he held his tongue, on seeing a tall, lean woman come from a shed\r\nbeside which they were standing. She proved to be Philom\xc3\xa8ne Sauvagnat,\r\nsister of the chief of the dep\xc3\xb4t, and the second Madame Pecqueux. The\r\ncouple must have been talking together in the shed, when Pecqueux came\r\nout to call to the assistant station-master. Philom\xc3\xa8ne still looked\r\nyoung in spite of her two-and-thirty years, but was raw-boned, with a\r\nflat chest, a long head, and flaming eyes. She had the reputation of\r\ndrinking. Her occupation consisted in keeping house for her brother,\r\nwho lived in a cottage near the engine-dep\xc3\xb4t, which she very much\r\nneglected. They came from Auvergne, and the brother, an obstinate man\r\nand a strict disciplinarian, greatly esteemed by his superiors, had met\r\nwith the utmost vexation on account of this sister, even to the point\r\nof being threatened with dismissal. And, if the company bore with her,\r\nnow, on his account, he only kept her with him because of the family\r\ntie. But this did not prevent him belabouring her so severely with\r\nblows whenever he caught her at fault, that he frequently left her half\r\ndead on the floor. She had commenced an intrigue with Pecqueux about\r\na year before; but it was only S\xc3\xa9verine, who had fallen out with her,\r\nthinking it due to Mother Victoire for her to do so. Having already\r\nbeen in the habit of avoiding her as much as possible, from a feeling\r\nof innate pride, she had subsequently ceased to greet her.\r\n\r\n"Well, Pecqueux, I shall see you again, later on!" said Philom\xc3\xa8ne\r\nsaucily. "I\'ll leave you now, as M. Roubaud has a moral lecture to read\r\nyou, on behalf of his wife."\r\n\r\nPecqueux, who was a good-natured fellow, continued laughing.\r\n\r\n"No, no, stay," he answered. "He\'s only joking."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t," retorted Philom\xc3\xa8ne. "I must run and take these two eggs from\r\nmy hens, to Madame Lebleu, to whom I promised them."\r\n\r\nShe had purposely let fly this name, being aware of the secret\r\nrivalry between the wife of the cashier, and the wife of the assistant\r\nstation-master, affecting to be on the best of terms with the former,\r\nso as to enrage the other. But she remained, nevertheless, becoming all\r\nat once interested, when she heard the fireman inquiring for news of\r\nthe affair with the sub-prefect.\r\n\r\n"So it\'s all settled; and you\'re very glad of it, are you not, M.\r\nRoubaud?" inquired Pecqueux.\r\n\r\n"Very pleased indeed," answered the assistant station-master.\r\n\r\nPecqueux gave a cunning wink.\r\n\r\n"Oh! you had no need to be anxious," said he, "because when one has\r\na big-wig behind one, eh? You know who I mean. My wife also is very\r\ngrateful to him."\r\n\r\nThe assistant station-master interrupted this allusion to President\r\nGrandmorin, by abruptly remarking:\r\n\r\n"And so you only leave to-night?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," answered the other; "the repairs to La Lison will soon be\r\nfinished. They\'re completing the adjustment of the connecting-rod. And\r\nI\'m waiting for my driver, who has gone for an airing. Do you know him,\r\nJacques Lantier? He comes from the same neighbourhood as yourself."\r\n\r\nRoubaud did not answer for an instant, but stood there as if\r\nabsent-minded. Then, recovering himself with a start, he exclaimed:\r\n\r\n"Eh! Jacques Lantier, the driver? Of course I know him! Oh! you\r\nunderstand, enough to say good-day and good-night. It was here that\r\nwe came across one another, for he is my junior, and I never saw him\r\ndown there at Plassans. Last autumn he did my wife a little service, in\r\nthe form of an errand to some cousins at Dieppe. He\'s a capable young\r\nfellow, according to all I hear."\r\n\r\nHe spoke at random, with abundance of verbosity. All at once he went\r\noff with the remark:\r\n\r\n"Good day, Pecqueux. I\'ve got to take a look round here."\r\n\r\nIt was only then that Philom\xc3\xa8ne moved away at her long stride; while\r\nPecqueux, standing motionless, with his hands thrust into his pockets,\r\nlaughing at ease at his laziness on this bright morning, was astonished\r\nto see the assistant station-master rapidly returning, after limiting\r\nhis inspection to circumambulating the shed. He had not been long\r\ntaking his look round. What on earth could he have come to spy out?\r\n\r\nNine o\'clock was on the point of striking, as Roubaud returned under\r\nthe marquee. He walked to the end, near the parcel office, where he\r\ngave a look, without appearing to find what he sought; and then,\r\nimpatiently, strode back again, peering inquiringly at the offices of\r\nthe different departments, one after the other. The station, at this\r\nhour, was quiet and deserted. He alone wandered about, more and more\r\nenervated at this peacefulness, in the torment of a man menaced with a\r\ncatastrophe, who at last ardently hopes for it to come. His composure\r\nwas exhausted. He found it impossible to remain for a minute in the\r\nsame place. Now his eyes never quitted the clock. Nine, five minutes\r\npast. As a rule he only went up to his rooms for the knife-and-fork\r\nbreakfast at ten, after the departure of the 9.50 train. But all at\r\nonce the thought struck him that S\xc3\xa9verine must also be waiting there in\r\nexpectancy; and he proceeded to join her.\r\n\r\nIn the corridor, Madame Lebleu, at this precise moment, was opening\r\nthe door to Philom\xc3\xa8ne, who had run round in neighbourly fashion, with\r\nuntidy hair, and held a couple of eggs in her hand. They remained on\r\nthe threshold, so that Roubaud had to enter his apartment before their\r\neyes. He had his key, and was as quick as he could be. Notwithstanding,\r\nin the rapid opening and closing of the door, they perceived S\xc3\xa9verine,\r\nseated on a chair in the dining-room, with her hands idle, her\r\nprofile pale, and her body motionless. And Madame Lebleu, dragging\r\nin Philom\xc3\xa8ne and closing her own door, related that she had already\r\nseen S\xc3\xa9verine in the same state, in the early part of the morning.\r\nNo doubt the business with the sub-prefect was taking a bad turn.\r\nBut no; and Philom\xc3\xa8ne explained that she had hastened to make a call\r\nbecause she had news; and she repeated what she had just heard the\r\nassistant station-master say himself. The two women were then lost\r\nin conjectures. It was the same at each of their meetings--gossiping\r\nwithout end.\r\n\r\n"They\'ve had their hair combed, my dear," said Madame Lebleu. "I\'d\r\nstake my life on it. They\'re tottering on their pedestals."\r\n\r\n"Ah! my dear lady," answered Philom\xc3\xa8ne, "if we could only be rid of\r\nthem!"\r\n\r\nThe rivalry between the Lebleus and the Roubauds, which had become\r\nmore and more envenomed, simply arose from a question of apartments.\r\nAll the first floor of the main station building, served to lodge\r\nmembers of the staff; and the central corridor, a regular corridor of\r\na second-rate hotel, painted yellow, lighted from above, separated\r\nthe floor in two, with lines of brown doors to right and left. Only\r\nthe windows of the apartments on the right, looked on the courtyard\r\nfacing the entrance, which was planted with old elms, and above these\r\nan admirable view spread out in the direction of Ingouville; while the\r\napartments on the left, with semicircular, squatty windows, opened\r\nright on the marquee of the station, whose high slanting roof of zinc\r\nand dirty glass barred the horizon from view. Nothing could be more gay\r\nthan the one side, with the constant animation in the courtyard, the\r\nverdure of the trees, the broad expanse of country; nothing more dismal\r\nthan the other, where it was almost impossible to see, and where the\r\nsky was shut out as in a prison.\r\n\r\nOn the front, resided the station-master, the assistant station-master\r\nMoulin, and the Lebleus; on the back, the Roubauds and Mademoiselle\r\nGuichon, the office-keeper, without counting three rooms reserved to\r\ninspectors who made occasional visits. It was an established fact that\r\nthe two assistant station-masters had always lodged side by side. If\r\nthe Lebleus were there, it was due to an act of politeness on the part\r\nof the gentleman who had been succeeded by Roubaud, and who, being a\r\nwidower without children, had thought proper to show Madame Lebleu\r\nthe courtesy of giving up his apartments to her. But should not this\r\nlodging have gone to the Roubauds? Was it fair to relegate them to the\r\nback of the building, when they had the right to be on the front? So\r\nlong as the two households had lived in harmony, S\xc3\xa9verine had given way\r\nto her neighbour, her senior by twenty years, who, moreover, was in bad\r\nhealth, being so stout that she was constantly troubled with fits of\r\nchoking. War had only been declared, since the day Philom\xc3\xa8ne set the\r\ntwo women at variance, by her abominable tongue.\r\n\r\n"You know," resumed the latter, "that they are quite capable of having\r\ntaken advantage of their trip to Paris, to ask for your ejectment. I am\r\ntold that they have written a long letter to the manager, setting forth\r\ntheir claim."\r\n\r\nMadame Lebleu was suffocating.\r\n\r\n"The wretches!" she exclaimed. "And I am sure they have been doing\r\ntheir best to get the office-keeper on their side. For the past\r\nfortnight she has hardly greeted me. There is another one who is no\r\nbetter than she should be! But I\'m watching her."\r\n\r\nShe lowered her voice to say that Mademoiselle Guichon must be carrying\r\non an intrigue with the station-master. Their doors faced one another.\r\nIt was M. Dabadie, a widower, and the father of a grown-up daughter\r\nstill at school, who had brought this thirty-year-old blonde to the\r\nstation. Already faded, she was silent, slim, and supple as a serpent.\r\nShe must have been a sort of governess. And it was impossible to catch\r\nher, so noiselessly did she glide along through the narrowest apertures.\r\n\r\n"Oh! I shall succeed in finding it out," continued Madame Lebleu. "I\r\nwill not be ridden down. We are here, and here we remain. All worthy\r\npeople are on our side. Is it not so, my dear?"\r\n\r\nIndeed, all the station was impassioned with this battle of the\r\nlodgings. The corridor, particularly, was torn asunder by it. It was\r\nonly the assistant station-master Moulin, satisfied at being on the\r\nfront, who did not take much interest in the matter. He was married\r\nto a little, timid, delicate woman, whom nobody ever saw, but who\r\npresented him with a baby every twenty months.\r\n\r\n"Anyhow," concluded Philom\xc3\xa8ne, "if they are tottering on their\r\npedestals, this shock will not bring them down. Be on your guard, for\r\nthey know someone of great influence."\r\n\r\nShe still held her two eggs, and she presented them, eggs laid that\r\nsame morning, which she had just taken from under her hens, and the old\r\nlady was effusive in thanks.\r\n\r\n"Oh! how kind of you!" said she. "You are spoiling me, I declare. Come\r\nand have a chat more frequently. You know that my husband is always in\r\nhis counting-house; and I have a tedious time of it, riveted here on\r\naccount of my poor legs! What would become of me, if those wretches\r\nwere to take away my view?"\r\n\r\nThen, as she accompanied her, and opened the door, she placed a finger\r\non her lips.\r\n\r\n"Hush! Let us listen," said she.\r\n\r\nBoth of them remained standing in the corridor for five full minutes,\r\nholding their breath, without a movement. They bent their heads, with\r\nears turned towards the dining-room of the Roubauds; but not a sound\r\ncame from that direction. Deathlike silence reigned within. And, in\r\nfear of being surprised, they at last separated, giving each other a\r\nnod, without pronouncing a word. While one went off on tiptoe, the\r\nother closed her door so gently, that the catch could hardly be heard\r\nentering the socket.\r\n\r\nAt 9.20 Roubaud was again below under the marquee superintending the\r\nmaking-up of the 9.50 slow train; and, in spite of all his efforts\r\nto keep calm, he gesticulated more than ever, stamping his feet, and\r\nturning round at every moment to examine the platform from one end to\r\nthe other. But nothing came, and his hands trembled with impatience.\r\n\r\nThen, abruptly, as he was looking behind him, and searching again all\r\nover the station, he heard a telegraph boy, out of breath, close to\r\nhim, saying:\r\n\r\n"Monsieur Roubaud, do you know where the station-master, and the\r\ncommissary of police are? I have got telegrams for them, and have been\r\nrunning after them for the last ten minutes."\r\n\r\nHe turned round with such a stiffening of all his being, that not a\r\nmuscle of his face moved. His eyes were fixed on the two telegrams\r\nwhich the lad held in his hand. And this time, from the excited look of\r\nthe latter, he felt convinced that the catastrophe had come at last.\r\n\r\n"Monsieur Dabadie passed by here a short time ago," said he tranquilly.\r\n\r\nAnd never had he felt himself so cool, with an intelligence so bright,\r\nprepared for the defence from head to foot.\r\n\r\n"Look!" he resumed; "here is Monsieur Dabadie coming towards us."\r\n\r\nIn fact, the station-master was returning from the goods train\r\ndepartment. As soon as he had run his eye over the telegram, he\r\nexclaimed:\r\n\r\n"There has been a murder on the line. The inspector at Rouen telegraphs\r\nto me to that effect."\r\n\r\n"What?" inquired Roubaud; "a murder among our staff?"\r\n\r\n"No, no," answered the station-master. "The murder of a passenger in a\r\ncoup\xc3\xa9. The body was thrown out almost at the exit from the tunnel of\r\nMalaunay at post 153. And the victim is one of our directors, President\r\nGrandmorin."\r\n\r\nThe assistant station-master immediately exclaimed:\r\n\r\n"The President! Ah! my poor wife, what a terrible blow it will be for\r\nher!"\r\n\r\nThe tone was so natural, so pitiful, that it for a moment arrested the\r\nattention of M. Dabadie.\r\n\r\n"Ah! true enough!" said he; "you knew him. Such a worthy man, was he\r\nnot?"\r\n\r\nThen, turning to the other telegram addressed to the commissary of\r\npolice, he added:\r\n\r\n"This must be from the examining-magistrate, no doubt for some\r\nformality. And, as it is only 9.25, Monsieur Cauche is not yet here,\r\nnaturally. Let someone run to the Caf\xc3\xa9 du Commerce, on the Cours\r\nNapol\xc3\xa9on. He will be found there for certain."\r\n\r\nFive minutes later M. Cauche arrived, brought to the scene by a porter.\r\nFormerly an officer, he looked upon the post he occupied as a sinecure,\r\nand never put in an appearance at the station before ten o\'clock, when\r\nhe strolled about for a moment or two, and returned to the caf\xc3\xa9. This\r\ndrama, which had burst upon him between a couple of games at piquet,\r\nhad first of all astonished him, for the matters that passed through\r\nhis hands were not, as a rule, very grave. But the telegram came from\r\nthe examining-magistrate at Rouen; and, if it arrived twelve hours\r\nafter the discovery of the body, it was because this magistrate had\r\nfirst of all telegraphed to the station-master at Paris, to ascertain\r\nunder what circumstances the victim had set out on his journey. Having\r\nfound out the number of the train, and that of the carriage, he had\r\nonly then sent orders to the commissary of police to examine the coup\xc3\xa9\r\nin carriage 293 if it still happened to be at Havre. The ill-humour\r\nthat M. Cauche displayed at having been disturbed needlessly, as he\r\nhad at first fancied, at once gave place to an attitude of extreme\r\nimportance, proportionate to the exceptional gravity that the affair\r\nbegan to assume.\r\n\r\n"But," he exclaimed, suddenly becoming anxious, in fear lest the\r\ninquiry might escape him, "the carriage will no longer be here, it must\r\nhave gone back this morning."\r\n\r\nIt was Roubaud who reassured him in his calm manner.\r\n\r\n"No, no, excuse me," he broke in. "There was a coup\xc3\xa9 booked for this\r\nevening. The carriage is there in the coach-house."\r\n\r\nAnd he led the way to the building, followed by the commissary and the\r\nstation-master. In the meanwhile, the news must have spread, for the\r\nporters, slyly leaving their work, also followed; while clerks made\r\ntheir appearance on the thresholds of the offices of the different\r\ndepartments, and ended by approaching one by one. A small crowd had\r\nsoon assembled.\r\n\r\nAs they came to the carriage, M. Dabadie remarked:\r\n\r\n"But the coaches were examined last night. If any traces had remained,\r\nit would have been mentioned in the report."\r\n\r\n"We shall soon see," said M. Cauche.\r\n\r\nOpening the door, he went up into the coup\xc3\xa9. And, forgetting himself,\r\nhe immediately exclaimed with an oath:\r\n\r\n"It looks as if they had been bleeding a pig here!"\r\n\r\nA little thrill of horror ran through all who were present, and a\r\nnumber of necks were craned forward. M. Dabadie was one of the first\r\nwho wished to see. He drew himself up on the step; while behind him,\r\nRoubaud, to do like the others, also craned his neck.\r\n\r\nThe inside of the coup\xc3\xa9 displayed no disorder. The windows had remained\r\nclosed, and everything seemed in its proper place. Only, a frightful\r\nstench escaped by the open door; and there, in the middle of one of the\r\ncushions, a pool of blood had coagulated, a pool so deep, and so large,\r\nthat a stream had sprung from it, as from a source, and had poured over\r\non the carpet. Clots of blood remained sticking to the cloth. And there\r\nwas nothing else, nothing but this nauseous gore.\r\n\r\nM. Dabadie flew into a rage.\r\n\r\n"Where are the men who looked into the carriages last night? Bring them\r\nhere!"\r\n\r\nIt so happened that they were there, and they advanced, spluttering\r\nexcuses: how was it possible to see at night time? Nevertheless, they\r\nhad passed their hands everywhere. They vowed they had felt nothing on\r\nthe previous night.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, M. Cauche, who remained standing up in the\r\ncompartment, was taking pencil notes for his report. He called Roubaud,\r\nwith whom he was familiar, being in the habit of smoking cigarettes\r\nwith him along the platform, in moments of leisure.\r\n\r\n"Roubaud," said he, "just come up here, you will be able to help me."\r\n\r\nAnd when the assistant station-master had stepped over the blood on the\r\ncarpet, so as not to tread in it, the commissary added:\r\n\r\n"Look under the other cushion, to see if anything has slipped down\r\nthere."\r\n\r\nRoubaud raised the cushion, feeling with prudent hands, and looks that\r\nsimply denoted curiosity.\r\n\r\n"There is nothing," said he.\r\n\r\nBut a spot on the padded cloth at the back of the seat, attracted his\r\nattention; and he pointed it out to the commissary. Was it not the mark\r\nof a finger covered with blood? No; they both came to the conclusion\r\nthat it was some blood which had spurted there. The crowd had drawn\r\nnearer, to watch this inspection of the coup\xc3\xa9, sniffing the crime,\r\npressing behind the station-master, who, with the repugnance of a\r\nrefined man, remained on the step.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the latter remarked:\r\n\r\n"But, I say, Roubaud, you were in the train, were you not? You returned\r\nlast night by the express. You can, perhaps, give us some information?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed," exclaimed the commissary, "that is true. Did you notice\r\nanything?"\r\n\r\nRoubaud, for two or three seconds, remained silent. At this moment, he\r\nwas bending down examining the carpet. But he rose, almost at once,\r\nanswering in his natural voice, which was a trifle thick:\r\n\r\n"Certainly, certainly, I will tell you. My wife was with me. But if\r\nwhat I am going to say is to figure in the report, I should like her to\r\ncome down, so as to control my recollection by her own."\r\n\r\nM. Cauche thought this very reasonable, and Pecqueux, who had just\r\narrived, offered to go and fetch Madame Roubaud. He started off with\r\ngreat strides, and for a moment there was a pause. Philom\xc3\xa8ne, who\r\nhad joined the crowd with the firemen, followed him with her eyes,\r\nirritated that he should undertake this errand. But, perceiving Madame\r\nLebleu hurrying along as fast as her poor swollen legs would carry her,\r\nshe hastened forward to assist her; and the two women raised their\r\nhands to heaven, uttering passionate exclamations at the discovery of\r\nsuch an abominable crime. Although absolutely no details were known,\r\nas yet, all kinds of versions of what had occurred, circulated around\r\nthem, accompanied by excited gestures and looks. Philom\xc3\xa8ne, whose voice\r\ncould be heard above the hum of the crowd, affirmed, on her word of\r\nhonour, that Madame Roubaud had seen the murderer, although she had no\r\nauthority whatever for the statement. And when the latter appeared,\r\naccompanied by Pecqueux, there was general silence.\r\n\r\n"Just look at her!" murmured Madame Lebleu. "Would anyone take her for\r\nthe wife of an assistant station-master, with her airs of a princess?\r\nThis morning, before daybreak, she was already as she is now, combed\r\nand laced, as if she were going out on a visit."\r\n\r\nS\xc3\xa9verine advanced with short, regular steps. She had to walk along the\r\nwhole length of the platform, facing the eyes watching her approach.\r\nBut she did not break down. She simply pressed her handkerchief to her\r\neyelids, in the great grief she had just experienced at learning the\r\nname of the victim. Attired in a very elegantly fashioned black woollen\r\ngown, she seemed to be wearing mourning for her protector. Her heavy,\r\ndark hair shone in the sun, for she had come down in such a hurry that\r\nshe had not found time, in spite of the cold, to put anything on her\r\nhead. Her gentle blue eyes, full of anguish, and bathed in tears, gave\r\nher a most touching appearance.\r\n\r\n"She may well cry," said Philom\xc3\xa8ne in an undertone. "They are done for,\r\nnow that their guardian-angel has been killed."\r\n\r\nWhen S\xc3\xa9verine was there, in the middle of all the people, before the\r\nopen door of the coup\xc3\xa9, M. Cauche and Roubaud got out; and the latter\r\nimmediately began to relate what he knew. Addressing his wife, he said:\r\n\r\n"Yesterday morning, my dear, as soon as we arrived at Paris we went to\r\nsee Monsieur Grandmorin. And it was about a quarter past eleven. That\r\nis right, is it not?"\r\n\r\nHe looked fixedly at her, and she, in a docile tone, repeated:\r\n\r\n"Yes, a quarter past eleven."\r\n\r\nBut her eyes had fallen on the cushion black with blood. She had a\r\nspasm, and her bosom heaved with heavy sobs. The station-master, who\r\nfelt distressed, intervened with much concern:\r\n\r\n"If you are unable to bear the sight, madam----We quite understand your\r\ngrief----"\r\n\r\n"Oh! just a few words," interrupted the commissary; "and we will then\r\nhave madam conducted home again."\r\n\r\nRoubaud hastened to continue:\r\n\r\n"It was at this visit that Monsieur Grandmorin, after talking of\r\nvarious matters, informed us that he was going next day to Doinville,\r\non a visit to his sister. I still see him seated at his writing-table.\r\nI was here, my wife there. That is right, my dear, is it not? He told\r\nus he would be leaving on the morrow."\r\n\r\n"Yes, on the morrow," said she.\r\n\r\nM. Cauche, who continued taking rapid pencil notes, raised his head:\r\n\r\n"How is that, on the morrow," he inquired, "considering he left the\r\nsame evening?"\r\n\r\n"Wait a moment," replied the assistant station-master. "When he heard\r\nwe were returning that night, he had an idea of taking the express with\r\nus, if my wife would accompany him to Doinville, to stay a few days\r\nwith his sister, as had happened before. But my wife, having a great\r\ndeal to do here, refused. That is so, you refused?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I refused," answered S\xc3\xa9verine.\r\n\r\n"Then he was very kind," continued her husband. "He had been\r\ninteresting himself on my behalf. He accompanied us to the door of his\r\nstudy. Did he not, my dear?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, as far as the door," said S\xc3\xa9verine.\r\n\r\n"We left in the evening," resumed Roubaud. "Before seating ourselves\r\nin our compartment, I had a chat with Monsieur Vandorpe, the\r\nstation-master. And I saw nothing at all. I was very much annoyed,\r\nbecause I thought we should be alone, and I found a lady in a corner\r\nwhom I had not noticed; and the more so, as two other persons, a\r\nmarried couple, got in at the last moment. So far as Rouen, nothing\r\nworthy of note occurred. I noticed nothing. But at Rouen, as we left\r\nthe train to stretch our legs, what was our surprise to see Monsieur\r\nGrandmorin standing up at the door of a coup\xc3\xa9, three or four carriages\r\naway from our compartment. \'What, Mr. President,\' said I, \'so you left\r\nafter all? Ah! well, we had no idea we were travelling with you!\' And\r\nhe explained that he had received a telegram. They whistled, and we\r\njumped into our compartment, which, by the way, we found empty, all our\r\ntravelling companions having got out at Rouen, and we were not sorry.\r\nThat is absolutely all, my dear, is it not?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, that is absolutely all," she repeated.\r\n\r\nThis story, simple though it appeared, produced a strong impression\r\non the audience. All awaited the key to the enigma with gaping\r\ncountenances. The commissary ceasing to write, gave expression to the\r\ngeneral astonishment by inquiring:\r\n\r\n"And you are sure no one was inside the coup\xc3\xa9, along with Monsieur\r\nGrandmorin?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! as to that, absolutely certain!"\r\n\r\nA shudder ran through the crowd. This mystery which required solving\r\ninspired the onlookers with fear, and sent a chill down the backs of\r\neveryone there. If the passenger was alone, by whom could he have been\r\nmurdered and thrown from the coup\xc3\xa9, three leagues from there, before\r\nthe train stopped again?\r\n\r\nSilence was broken by the unpleasant voice of Philom\xc3\xa8ne:\r\n\r\n"It is all the same strange," said she.\r\n\r\nAnd Roubaud, feeling himself being stared at, looked at her, tossing\r\nhis chin, as if to say that he also considered the matter strange.\r\nBeside her, he perceived Pecqueux and Madame Lebleu, tossing their\r\nheads as well. All eyes were turned towards him. The crowd awaited\r\nsomething more, sought on his body for a forgotten detail that would\r\nthrow light on the matter. There was no accusation in these ardently\r\ninquisitive looks; and yet, he fancied he noticed a vague suspicion\r\narising, that doubt which the smallest fact sometimes transforms into a\r\ncertainty.\r\n\r\n"Extraordinary," murmured M. Cauche.\r\n\r\n"Quite extraordinary," assented M. Dabadie.\r\n\r\nThen Roubaud made up his mind.\r\n\r\n"What I am, moreover, quite certain of," he continued, "is that the\r\nexpress which runs from Rouen to Barentin without stopping, went\r\nalong at the regulation speed, and that I noticed nothing abnormal.\r\nI mention this, because, as we were alone, I let down the window to\r\nsmoke a cigarette, and glancing outside several times, had a perfect\r\nknowledge of every sound of the train. At Barentin, noticing my\r\nsuccessor, the station-master, Monsieur Bessi\xc3\xa8re, on the platform, I\r\ncalled to him, and we exchanged a few words, as he stood on the step,\r\nand shook hands. That is so, my dear, is it not? The question can be\r\nput to Monsieur Bessi\xc3\xa8re, and he will answer, Yes."\r\n\r\nS\xc3\xa9verine, still motionless and pale, her delicate face plunged in\r\ngrief, once more confirmed the statement of her husband.\r\n\r\n"Yes, that is correct," said she.\r\n\r\nFrom this moment any accusation was out of the question, if the\r\nRoubauds, having returned to their compartment at Rouen, had been\r\ngreeted, sitting there, by a friend at Barentin. The shadow of\r\nsuspicion which the assistant station-master had noticed in the eyes of\r\nthe bystanders, vanished, while the general astonishment increased. The\r\ncase was assuming a more and more mysterious aspect.\r\n\r\n"Come," said the commissary, "are you quite positive that nobody could\r\nhave entered the coup\xc3\xa9 at Rouen, after you left Monsieur Grandmorin?"\r\n\r\nRoubaud had evidently not foreseen this question. For the first time,\r\nhe became confused, having no doubt got to the end of his ready\r\nanswers. He looked at his wife, hesitating.\r\n\r\n"Oh! no!" said he; "I do not think so. They were shutting the doors;\r\nthey had whistled. We only just had time to reach our carriage. And,\r\nbesides, the coup\xc3\xa9 was reserved, nobody could get in there, I fancy----"\r\n\r\nBut the blue eyes of his wife opened wider, and grew so large, that he\r\nwas afraid to be positive.\r\n\r\n"After all," he continued, "I don\'t know. Yes. Perhaps someone did get\r\ninto the coup\xc3\xa9. There was a regular crush----"\r\n\r\nAs he continued talking, his voice became distinct again, and a new\r\nstory began to take shape.\r\n\r\n"The crowd, you know, was enormous," he said, "on account of the f\xc3\xaates\r\nat Havre. We were obliged to resist an assault on our own compartment\r\nby second and even third-class passengers. Apart from this, the station\r\nwas badly lighted, one could see next to nothing. People were pushing\r\nabout in a clamorous multitude, just as the train was starting. Yes,\r\nindeed, it is quite possible that someone, not knowing where to find a\r\nseat, or, may be, taking advantage of the confusion, actually did force\r\nhis way into the coup\xc3\xa9, at the last second."\r\n\r\nAnd, turning to his wife, he remarked:\r\n\r\n"Eh! my dear, that is what must have happened?"\r\n\r\nS\xc3\xa9verine, looking broken down, with her handkerchief pressed to her\r\nswollen eyes, answered:\r\n\r\n"That is what happened, certainly."\r\n\r\nThe clue was now given. The commissary of police and the\r\nstation-master, without expressing an opinion, exchanged a look of\r\nintelligence. The seething crowd swayed to and fro, feeling the inquiry\r\nat an end. All were burning to communicate their thoughts; and various\r\nconjectures immediately found vent, everyone having his own idea. For a\r\nfew moments, the business of the station had been at a standstill. The\r\nentire staff were there, all their attention taken up by this drama;\r\nand it was with general surprise that the 9.38 train was observed\r\ncoming in, under the marquee. The porters ran to meet it, the carriage\r\ndoors were opened, and the flood of passengers streamed out. But almost\r\nall the lookers-on had remained round the commissary, who, with the\r\nscruple of a methodical man, paid a final visit to the gory coup\xc3\xa9.\r\n\r\nAt this moment, Pecqueux, engaged in gesticulating between Madame\r\nLebleu and Philom\xc3\xa8ne, caught sight of his driver, Jacques Lantier,\r\nwho, having just left the train, was standing motionless, watching\r\nthe gathering from a distance. He beckoned to him urgently. At first,\r\nJacques did not move; but, afterwards, making up his mind to go, he\r\nadvanced slowly forward.\r\n\r\n"What\'s it all about?" he inquired of his fireman.\r\n\r\nHe knew very well, and lent but an inattentive ear to the news of the\r\nmurder and the rumours that were current respecting it. What surprised,\r\nand particularly agitated him, was to tumble into the midst of this\r\ninquiry, to again come upon this coup\xc3\xa9 which he had caught sight of in\r\nthe obscurity, launched at full speed. He craned his neck, gazing at\r\nthe pool of clotted blood on the cushion; and, once more, he saw the\r\nmurder scene, and particularly the corpse, stretched across the line\r\nyonder with its throat open. Then, turning aside his eyes, he noticed\r\nthe Roubauds, while Pecqueux continued relating to him the story of\r\nhow they were mixed up in the business--their departure from Paris in\r\nthe same train as the victim, and the last words they had exchanged\r\ntogether at Rouen. Jacques knew Roubaud, from having occasionally\r\npressed his hand since he had been driving the express. As to his wife,\r\nhe had caught sight of her in the distance, and he had avoided her,\r\nlike the others, in his unhealthy terror. But, at this moment, he was\r\nstruck by her, as he observed her weeping and pale, with her gentle,\r\nbewildered blue eyes, beneath the crushing volume of black hair. He\r\ncontinued to look at her; and, becoming absent, he asked himself, in\r\nsurprise, how it was that the Roubauds and he were there? How it was\r\nthat events had brought them together, before this carriage steeped in\r\ncrime--they who had returned from Paris on the previous evening, he who\r\nhad come back from Barentin at that very instant?\r\n\r\n"Oh! I know, I know," said he aloud, interrupting the fireman. "I\r\nhappened to be there, at the exit from the tunnel, last night, and I\r\nthought I saw something, as the train passed."\r\n\r\nThis remark caused great excitement, and everybody gathered round\r\nhim. Why had he spoken, after formally making up his mind to hold\r\nhis tongue? So many excellent reasons prompted him to silence! And\r\nthe words had unconsciously left his lips, while he was gazing at\r\nthis woman. She had abruptly drawn aside her handkerchief, to fix her\r\ntearful eyes, wide-open, on him.\r\n\r\nThe commissary of police quickly approached.\r\n\r\n"Saw what? What did you see?" he inquired.\r\n\r\nAnd Jacques, with the unswerving look of S\xc3\xa9verine upon him, related\r\nwhat he had seen: the coup\xc3\xa9 lit up, passing through the night at full\r\nspeed, and the fleeting outlines of the two men, one thrown down\r\nbackwards, the other with a knife in his hand. Roubaud, standing beside\r\nhis wife, listened with his great bright eyes fixed on Jacques.\r\n\r\n"So," inquired the commissary, "you would be able to recognise the\r\nmurderer?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! as to that, no! I do not think so," answered the other.\r\n\r\n"Was he wearing a coat, or a blouse?" asked the commissary.\r\n\r\n"I can say nothing positively. Just reflect, a train that must have\r\nbeen going at a speed of sixty miles an hour!"\r\n\r\nS\xc3\xa9verine, against her will, exchanged a glance with Roubaud, who had\r\nthe energy to say:\r\n\r\n"True enough! It would require a good pair of eyes."\r\n\r\n"No matter," concluded M. Cauche; "this is an important piece of\r\nevidence. The examining-magistrate will assist you to throw light on it\r\nall. Monsieur Lantier and Monsieur Roubaud, give me your exact names\r\nfor the summonses."\r\n\r\nIt was all over. The throng of bystanders dispersed, little by little,\r\nand the business of the station resumed its activity. Roubaud had to\r\nrun and attend to the 9.50 slow train, in which passengers were already\r\ntaking their seats. He had given Jacques a more vigorous shake of\r\nthe hand than usual; and the latter, remaining alone with S\xc3\xa9verine,\r\nbehind Madame Lebleu, Pecqueux, and Philom\xc3\xa8ne, who went off whispering\r\ntogether, had considered himself bound to escort the young woman under\r\nthe marquee, to the foot of the staircase leading to the lodgings of\r\nthe staff, finding nothing to say, and yet forced to remain beside her,\r\nas if a bond had just been fastened between them.\r\n\r\nThe brightness of day, had now increased. The sun, conqueror of the\r\nmorning haze, was ascending in the great expanse of limpid blue\r\nsky; while the sea breeze, gaining strength with the rising tide,\r\ncontributed its saline freshness to the atmosphere. And, as Jacques\r\nat last left S\xc3\xa9verine, he again encountered those great eyes, whose\r\nterrified and imploring sweetness had so profoundly moved him.\r\n\r\nBut there came a low whistle. It was Roubaud giving the signal to\r\nstart. The engine responded by a prolonged screech, and the 9.50 train\r\nmoved off, rolled along more rapidly, and disappeared in the distance,\r\namid the golden dust of the sun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nOne day, during the second week in March, M. Denizet, the\r\nexamining-magistrate, had again summoned certain important witnesses in\r\nthe Grandmorin case, to his chambers at the Rouen Law Courts.\r\n\r\nFor the last three weeks, this case had been causing enormous\r\nsensation. It had set Rouen upside down; it had impassioned Paris;\r\nand the opposition newspapers, in their violent campaign against the\r\nEmpire, had just grasped it as a weapon. The forthcoming general\r\nelections, which occupied the public mind in preference to all other\r\npolitical events, added keen excitement to the struggle. In the Chamber\r\nthere had been some very stormy sittings; one at which the validity of\r\nthe powers of two members attached to the Emperor\'s household, had been\r\nbitterly disputed; and another that had given rise to a most determined\r\nattack on the financial administration of the Prefect of the Seine,\r\ncoupled with a demand for the election of a Municipal Council.\r\n\r\nThe Grandmorin case, coming at an appropriate moment, served to keep\r\nup the agitation. The most extraordinary stories were abroad. Every\r\nmorning, the newspapers were full of assumptions injurious for the\r\nGovernment. On the one hand, the public were given to understand that\r\nthe victim--a familiar figure at the Tuileries, formerly on the bench,\r\nCommander of the Legion of Honour, immensely rich--was addicted to\r\nthe most frightful debauchery; on the other, the inquiry into the\r\ncase, having so far proved fruitless, they began to accuse the police\r\nand legal authorities, of winking at the affair, and joked about the\r\nlegendary assassin who could not be found. If there was a good deal of\r\ntruth in these attacks, they were all the harder to bear.\r\n\r\nM. Denizet was fully alive to his heavy responsibility. He, also,\r\nbecame impassioned with the case, and the more so as he was ambitious,\r\nand had been burning to have a matter of this importance in his hands,\r\nso as to bring into evidence the high qualities of perspicacity and\r\nenergy with which he credited himself.\r\n\r\nThe son of a large Normandy cattle-breeder, he had studied law at\r\nCaen, but had entered the judicial department of the Government rather\r\nlate in life; and, his peasant origin, aggravated by his father\'s\r\nbankruptcy, had made his promotion slow. Substitute at Bernay, Dieppe,\r\nand Havre, it had taken him ten years to become Imperial Procurator at\r\nPont-Audemer; then, sent to Rouen as substitute, he had been acting as\r\nexamining-magistrate for eighteen months, and was over fifty years of\r\nage.\r\n\r\nWithout any fortune, a prey to requirements that could not be satisfied\r\nout of his meagre salary, he lived in this ill-remunerated dependence\r\nof the magistracy, only frankly accepted by men of mediocre capacity,\r\nand where the intelligent are eaten up with envy, whilst on the\r\nlook-out for an opportunity to sell themselves.\r\n\r\nM. Denizet was a man of the most lively intelligence, with a very\r\npenetrating mind. He was even honest, and fond of his profession,\r\nintoxicated with his great power which, in his justice-room, made\r\nhim absolute master of the liberty of others. It was his interests\r\nalone that kept his zeal within bounds. He had such a burning desire\r\nto be decorated and transferred to Paris, that, after having at the\r\ncommencement of the inquiry, allowed himself to be carried away by his\r\nlove of truth, he now proceeded with extreme prudence, perceiving\r\npitfalls on all sides, which might swallow up his future.\r\n\r\nIt must be pointed out that M. Denizet had been warned; for, from the\r\noutset of his inquiry, a friend had advised him to look in at the\r\nMinistry of Justice in Paris. He did so, and had a long chat with the\r\nsecretary, M. Camy-Lamotte, a very important personage, possessing\r\nconsiderable power over the gentlemen comprising this branch of the\r\ncivil service. It was, moreover, his duty to prepare the list of\r\npromotions, and he was in constant communication with the Tuileries.\r\nHe was a handsome man, who had started on his career as substitute,\r\nlike his visitor; but through his connections and his wife, he had been\r\nelected deputy, and made grand officer of the Legion of Honour.\r\n\r\nThe case had come quite naturally into his hands. The Imperial\r\nProcurator at Rouen, disturbed at this shady drama wherein a former\r\njudge figured as victim, had taken the precaution to communicate with\r\nthe Minister, who had passed the matter on to the secretary. And here\r\ncame a coincidence: M. Camy-Lamotte happened to be a schoolfellow of\r\nPresident Grandmorin. Younger by a few years, he had been on such terms\r\nof intimacy with him that he knew him thoroughly, even to his vices.\r\nAnd so, he spoke of his friend\'s tragic death with profound affliction,\r\nand talked to M. Denizet of nothing but his warm desire to secure the\r\nguilty party. But he did not disguise the fact that they were very much\r\nannoyed at the Tuileries, about the stir the business had occasioned,\r\nwhich was quite out of proportion to its importance, and he had taken\r\nthe liberty to recommend great tact.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the magistrate had understood that he would do well not to be\r\nin a hurry, and to avoid running any risk unless previously approved.\r\nHe had even returned to Rouen with the certainty that the secretary,\r\non his part, had sent out detectives, wishing to inquire into the case\r\nhimself. They wanted to learn the truth, so as to be better able to\r\nhide it, if necessary.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, time passed, and M. Denizet, notwithstanding his efforts\r\nto be patient, became irritated at the jokes of the press. Then the\r\npoliceman reappeared, sniffing the scent, like a good hound. He was\r\ncarried away by the necessity of finding the real track, for the glory\r\nof being the first to discover it, and reserving his freedom to abandon\r\nit if he received orders to do so. And, whilst awaiting a letter, a\r\npiece of advice, a simple sign from the Ministry which failed to reach\r\nhim, he had actively resumed his inquiry.\r\n\r\nNot one of the two or three arrests that had been made, could be\r\nmaintained. But, suddenly, the opening of the will of President\r\nGrandmorin aroused in M. Denizet a suspicion, which he felt had flashed\r\nthrough his mind at the first--the possible guilt of the Roubauds.\r\nThis will, full of strange legacies, contained one by which S\xc3\xa9verine\r\ninherited the house situated at the place called La Croix-de-Maufras.\r\nFrom that moment, the motive of the crime, sought in vain until then,\r\nbecame evident--the Roubauds, aware of the legacy, had murdered their\r\nbenefactor to gain possession of the property at once. This idea\r\nhaunted him the more, as M. Camy-Lamotte had spoken in a peculiar\r\nway of Madame Roubaud, whom he had known formerly at the home of\r\nthe President when she was a young girl. Only, how unlikely! how\r\nimpossible, materially and morally! Since searching in this direction,\r\nhe had at every step, encountered facts that upset his conception of a\r\nclassically conducted judicial inquiry. Nothing became clear; the great\r\ncentral light, the original cause which would illuminate everything,\r\nwas wanting.\r\n\r\nAnother clue existed which M. Denizet had not lost sight of, the one\r\nsuggested by Roubaud himself--that of the man who might have got into\r\nthe coup\xc3\xa9, thanks to the crush, at the moment the train was leaving.\r\nThis was the famous legendary murderer who could not be found, and in\r\nreference to whom the opposition newspapers were making such silly fun.\r\nAt the outset, every effort had been made to trace this man. At Rouen,\r\nwhere he had entered the train, at Barentin, where he had left it; but\r\nthe result had lacked precision. Some witnesses even denied that it\r\ncould have been possible for the reserved coup\xc3\xa9 to be taken by assault,\r\nothers gave the most contradictory information. And this clue seemed\r\nunlikely to lead to anything, when the magistrate, in questioning the\r\nsignalman, Misard, came involuntarily upon the dramatic adventure of\r\nCabuche and Louisette, the young girl who, victimised by the President,\r\nhad repaired to the abode of her sweetheart to die.\r\n\r\nThis information burst on him like a thunderbolt, and at once he\r\nformulated the indictment in his head. It was all there--the threats\r\nof death made by the quarryman against his victim, the deplorable\r\nantecedents of the man, an alibi, clumsily advanced, impossible to\r\nprove. In secrecy, on the previous night, in a moment of energetic\r\ninspiration, he had caused Cabuche to be carried off from the little\r\nhouse he occupied on the border of the wood, a sort of out-of-the-way\r\ncavern, where those who arrested the man, found a pair of blood-stained\r\ntrousers. And, whilst offering resistance to the conviction gaining\r\non him, whilst determined not to abandon the presumption against the\r\nRoubauds, he exulted at the idea that he alone had been smart enough\r\nto discover the veritable assassin. It was in view of making this a\r\ncertainty that, on this specific day, he had summoned to his chambers\r\nseveral witnesses who had already been heard immediately after the\r\ncrime.\r\n\r\nThe quarters of the examining-magistrate were near the Rue Jeanne\r\nd\'Arc, in the old dilapidated building, dabbed against the side of\r\nthe ancient palace of the Dukes of Normandy, now transformed into the\r\nLaw Courts, which it dishonoured. This large, sad-looking room on the\r\nground floor was so dark, that in winter it became necessary to light\r\na lamp at three o\'clock in the afternoon. Hung with old, discoloured\r\ngreen paper, its only furniture were two armchairs, four chairs, the\r\nwriting-table of the magistrate, the small table of the registrar;\r\nand, on the frigid-looking mantelpiece, two bronze cups, flanking a\r\nblack marble timepiece. Behind the writing-table was a door leading to\r\na second room, where the magistrate sometimes concealed persons whom\r\nhe wished to have at hand; while the entrance door opened direct on a\r\nbroad corridor supplied with benches, where witnesses waited.\r\n\r\nThe Roubauds were there at half-past one, although the subp\xc5\x93nas had\r\nonly been made returnable for two o\'clock. They came from Havre, and\r\nhad taken time to lunch at a little restaurant in the Grande Rue. Both\r\nattired in black, he in a frock coat, she in a silk gown, like a lady,\r\nmaintained the rather wearisome and painful gravity of a couple who\r\nhad lost a relative. She sat on a bench motionless, without uttering\r\na word, whilst he, remaining on his feet, his hands behind his back,\r\nstrode slowly to and fro before her. But at each turn their eyes met,\r\nand their concealed anxiety then passed like a shadow over their mute\r\ncountenances.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Croix-de-Maufras legacy had given them great joy, it had\r\nrevived their fears; for the family of the President, particularly his\r\ndaughter, indignant at the number of strange donations which amounted\r\nto half the entire fortune, spoke of contesting the will; and Madame\r\nde Lachesnaye, influenced by her husband, showed herself particularly\r\nharsh for her old friend S\xc3\xa9verine, whom she loaded with the gravest\r\nsuspicions. On the other hand, the idea that there existed a proof,\r\nwhich Roubaud at first had not thought of, haunted him with constant\r\ndread: the letter which he had compelled his wife to write, so as\r\nto cause Grandmorin to leave, would be found, unless the latter had\r\ndestroyed it, and the writing recognised. Fortunately, time passed and\r\nnothing happened; the letter must have been torn up. Nevertheless,\r\nevery fresh summons to the presence of the examining-magistrate,\r\ngave them a cold perspiration in their correct attitude of heirs and\r\nwitnesses.\r\n\r\nTwo o\'clock struck. Jacques in his turn appeared. He came from Paris.\r\nRoubaud at once advanced, with his hand extended in a very expansive\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n"Ah! So they\'ve brought you here as well. What a nuisance this sad\r\nbusiness is. It seems to have no end!"\r\n\r\nJacques, perceiving S\xc3\xa9verine, still seated, motionless, had stopped\r\nshort. For the past three weeks, every two days, at each of his\r\njourneys to Havre, the assistant station-master had shown him great\r\naffability. On one occasion even, he had to accept an invitation to\r\nlunch; and seated beside the young woman, he felt himself agitated with\r\nhis old shivers, and quite upset. Could it be possible that he would\r\nwant to slay this one also? His heart throbbed, his hands burnt at\r\nthe mere sight of the white muslin at her neck, bordering the rounded\r\nbodice of her gown. And he determined, henceforth, to keep away from\r\nher.\r\n\r\n"And what do they say about the case at Paris?" resumed Roubaud.\r\n"Nothing new, eh? Look here, they know nothing; they\'ll never know\r\nanything. Come and say how do you do to my wife."\r\n\r\nHe dragged him forward, so that Jacques approached and bowed to\r\nS\xc3\xa9verine, who, looking a little confused, smiled with her air of a\r\ntimid child. He did his best to chat about commonplace matters, with\r\nthe eyes of the husband and wife fixed on him, as if they sought to\r\nread even beyond his own thoughts, in the vague reflections to which\r\nhe hesitated to lend his mind. Why was he so cold? Why did he seem to\r\ndo his best to avoid them? Was his memory returning? Could it be for\r\nthe purpose of confronting them with him, that they had been sent for\r\nagain? They sought to bring over this single witness, whom they feared,\r\nto their side, to attach him to them by such firm bonds of fraternity\r\nthat he would not have the courage to speak against them.\r\n\r\nIt was the assistant station-master, tortured by uncertainty, who\r\nbrought up the case again.\r\n\r\n"So you have no idea as to why they have summoned us? Perhaps there is\r\nsomething new?"\r\n\r\nJacques gave a shrug of indifference.\r\n\r\n"A rumour was abroad just now at the station, when I arrived, that\r\nthere had been an arrest," said he.\r\n\r\nThe Roubauds were astounded, becoming quite agitated and perplexed.\r\nWhat! An arrest? No one had breathed a word to them on the subject! An\r\narrest that had been already made, or an arrest about to take place?\r\nThey bombarded him with questions, but he knew nothing further.\r\n\r\nAt that moment, a sound of footsteps, in the corridor, attracted the\r\nattention of S\xc3\xa9verine.\r\n\r\n"Here come Berthe and her husband," she murmured.\r\n\r\nThe Lachesnayes passed very stiffly before the Roubauds. The young\r\nwoman did not even give her former comrade a look. An usher at once\r\nshowed them into the room of the examining-magistrate.\r\n\r\n"Oh! dear me! We must have patience," said Roubaud. "We shall be here\r\nfor at least two hours. Sit you down."\r\n\r\nHe had just placed himself on the left of S\xc3\xa9verine, and, with a motion\r\nof the hand, invited Jacques to take a seat near her, on the other\r\nside. The driver remained standing a moment longer. Then, as she\r\nlooked at him in her gentle, timid manner, he sank down on the bench.\r\nShe appeared very frail between the two men. He felt she possessed a\r\nsubmissive, tender character, and the slight warmth emanating from this\r\nwoman, slowly torpified him from tip to toe.\r\n\r\nIn M. Denizet\'s room the interrogatories were about to commence. The\r\ninquiry had already supplied matter for an enormous volume of papers,\r\nenclosed in blue wrappers. Every effort had been made to follow the\r\nvictim from the time he left Paris. M. Vandorpe, the station-master,\r\nhad given evidence as to the departure of the 6.30 express. How\r\nthe coach No. 293 had been added on at the last moment; how he had\r\nexchanged a few words with Roubaud, who had got into his compartment\r\na little before the arrival of President Grandmorin; finally, how the\r\nlatter had taken possession of his coup\xc3\xa9, where he was certainly alone.\r\n\r\nThen, the guard, Henri Dauvergne, questioned as to what had occurred\r\nat Rouen during the ten minutes the train waited, was unable to give\r\nany positive information. He had seen the Roubauds talking in front of\r\nthe coup\xc3\xa9, and he felt sure they had returned to their compartment, the\r\ndoor of which had been shut by an inspector; but his recollection was\r\nvague, owing to the confusion caused by the crowd, and the obscurity in\r\nthe station. As to giving an opinion whether a man, the famous murderer\r\nwho could not be found, would have been able to jump into the coup\xc3\xa9\r\nas the train started, he thought such a thing very unlikely, whilst\r\nadmitting it was possible; for, to his own knowledge, something similar\r\nhad already occurred twice.\r\n\r\nOther members of the company\'s staff at Rouen, on being examined on the\r\nsame points, instead of throwing light on the matter, only entangled\r\nit by their contradictory answers. Nevertheless, one thing proved was\r\nthe shake of the hand given by Roubaud from inside his compartment\r\nto the station-master at Barentin, who had got on the step. This\r\nstation-master, M. Bessi\xc3\xa8re, had formally acknowledged the incident as\r\nexact, and had added that his colleague was alone with his wife, who\r\nwas half lying down, and appeared to be tranquilly sleeping.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the authorities had gone so far as to search for the\r\npassengers who had quitted Paris in the same compartment as the\r\nRoubauds. The stout lady and gentleman who arrived late, almost at\r\nthe last minute, middle-class people from Petit-Couronne, had stated\r\nthat having immediately dozed off to sleep, they were unable to say\r\nanything; and, as to the woman in black, who remained silent in her\r\ncorner, she had melted away like a shadow. It had been absolutely\r\nimpossible to trace her.\r\n\r\nThen, there were other witnesses, the small fry who had served to\r\nidentify the passengers who left the train that night at Barentin, the\r\ntheory being that the murderer must have got out there. The tickets had\r\nbeen counted, and they had succeeded in recognising all the travellers\r\nexcept one, and he precisely was a great big fellow, with his head\r\nwrapped up in a blue handkerchief. Some said he wore a coat, and others\r\na short smock. About this man alone, who had disappeared, vanished\r\nlike a dream, there existed three hundred and ten documents, forming a\r\nconfused medley, in which the evidence of one person was contradicted\r\nby that of another.\r\n\r\nAnd the record was further complicated by the written evidence of the\r\nlegal authorities: the account drawn up by the registrar, whom the\r\nImperial Procurator and the examining-magistrate had taken to the scene\r\nof the crime, comprising quite a bulky description of the spot, on the\r\nmetal way, where the victim was lying; the position of the body, the\r\nattire, the things found in the pockets establishing his identity;\r\nthen, the report of the doctor, also conducted there, a document in\r\nwhich the wound in the throat was described at length in scientific\r\nterms; the only wound, a frightful gash, made with a sharp instrument,\r\nprobably a knife.\r\n\r\nAnd there were other reports and documents about the removal of the\r\nbody to the hospital at Rouen, the length of time it had remained\r\nthere before being delivered to the family. But in this mass of papers\r\nappeared but one or two important points. First of all, nothing had\r\nbeen found in the pockets, neither the watch, nor a small pocket-book,\r\nwhich should have contained ten banknotes of a thousand francs each,\r\na sum due to the sister of President Grandmorin, Madame Bonnehon, and\r\nwhich she was expecting.\r\n\r\nIt therefore would have seemed that the motive of the crime was\r\nrobbery, had not a ring, set with a large brilliant, remained on the\r\nfinger of the victim. This circumstance gave rise to quite a series of\r\nconjectures. Unfortunately the numbers of the banknotes were missing;\r\nbut the watch was known. It was a very heavy, keyless watch, with the\r\nmonogram of the President on the back, and the number, 2516, of the\r\nmanufacturer, inside. Finally, the weapon, the knife the murderer had\r\nused, had occasioned diligent search along the line, among the bushes\r\nin the vicinity, where he might have thrown it; but with no result. The\r\nmurderer must have concealed the knife in the same place as the watch\r\nand banknotes. Nothing had been found but the travelling-rug of the\r\nvictim, which had been picked up at a hundred yards or so from Barentin\r\nstation, where it had been abandoned as a dangerous article; and it\r\nfigured among other objects that might assist to convict the culprit.\r\n\r\nWhen the Lachesnayes entered, M. Denizet, erect before his\r\nwriting-table, was perusing the examination of one of the first\r\nwitnesses, which his registrar had just routed out from among the other\r\npapers. He was a short and rather robust man, clean-shaven, and already\r\nturning grey. His full cheeks, square chin, and big nose, had a sort\r\nof pallid immobility, which was increased by the heavy eyelids half\r\nclosing his great light eyes. But all the sagacity, all the adroitness\r\nhe believed he possessed, was centred in his mouth--one of those mouths\r\nof an actor that express the feelings of the owner off the stage.\r\nThis mouth was extremely active, and at moments, when he became very\r\nsharp, the lips grew thin. It was his sharpness that frequently led\r\nhim astray. He was too perspicacious, too cunning with simple, honest\r\ntruth. According to the ideal he had formed of his position, the man\r\noccupying it should be an anatomist in morals, endowed with second\r\nsight, extremely witty; and, indeed, he was by no means a fool.\r\n\r\nHe at once showed himself amiable towards Madame de Lachesnaye, for he\r\nwas still a magistrate full of urbanity, frequenting society in Rouen\r\nand its neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n"Pray be seated, madam," said he.\r\n\r\nAnd he offered a chair to the young woman, a sickly blonde,\r\ndisagreeable in manner, and ugly in her mourning. But he was simply\r\npolite, and even a trifle arrogant, in look, towards M. de Lachesnaye,\r\nwho was also fair, with a delicate skin; for this little man--judge at\r\nthe Court of Appeal from the age of thirty-six; decorated, thanks to\r\nthe influence of his father-in-law, and to the services his father,\r\nalso on the bench, had formerly rendered on the High Commissions, at\r\nthe time of the Coup d\'Etat--represented in his eyes, the judicial\r\nfunctionary by favour, by wealth, the man of moderate gifts who had\r\ninstalled himself, certain of making rapid progress through his\r\nrelatives and fortune; whereas he, poor, deprived of protective\r\ninfluence, found himself ever reduced to make way for others. And\r\nso he was not sorry to make this gentleman feel all his power in\r\nthis room--the absolute power that he possessed over the liberty\r\nof everyone, to such a point that, by one word, he could transform\r\na witness into an accused, and immediately have him arrested if it\r\npleased him to do so.\r\n\r\n"Madam," he continued, "you will pardon me, if I am again obliged\r\nto torture you with this painful business. I know that you wish, as\r\nardently as we do, to see the matter cleared up, and the culprit\r\nexpiate his crime."\r\n\r\nBy a sign he attracted the attention of the registrar, a big,\r\nbilious-looking fellow with a bony face, and the examination commenced.\r\n\r\nBut M. de Lachesnaye--who, seeing he was not asked to sit down, had\r\ntaken a seat of his own accord--at the first questions addressed to\r\nhis wife, did his best to put himself in her place. He proceeded to\r\ncomplain bitterly of the will of his father-in-law. Who had ever\r\nheard of such a thing? So many, and such important legacies, that\r\nthey absorbed almost half the fortune, which amounted to 3,700,000\r\nfrcs.--about \xc2\xa3148,000! And legacies to persons who for the most part\r\nthey did not know, to women of all classes! Among them figured even a\r\nlittle violet-seller, who sat in a doorway in the Rue du Rocher. It was\r\nunacceptable, and he was only waiting for the inquiry into the crime to\r\nbe completed, to see if he could not upset this immoral will.\r\n\r\nWhilst he complained in this manner, between his set teeth, showing\r\nwhat a stupid he was, an obstinate provincial, up to his neck in\r\navarice, M. Denizet watched him with his great light eyes half closed,\r\nand his artful lips assumed an expression of jealous disdain for this\r\nnonentity, who was not satisfied with two millions, and whom, no doubt,\r\nhe would one day, see in the supreme purple of a President, thanks to\r\nall this money.\r\n\r\n"I think, sir," said he at last, "that you would do wrong. The will\r\ncould only be attacked if the total amount of the legacies exceeded\r\nhalf the fortune, and such is not the case."\r\n\r\nThen, turning to his registrar, he remarked:\r\n\r\n"I say, Laurent, you are not writing down all this, I hope."\r\n\r\nWith the suspicion of a smile, the latter set his mind at ease, like a\r\nman who knew his business.\r\n\r\n"But, anyhow," resumed M. de Lachesnaye more bitterly, "no one\r\nimagines, I suppose, that I am going to leave La Croix-de-Maufras to\r\nthose Roubauds. A present like that to the daughter of a domestic! And\r\nwhy? for what reason? Besides, if it is proved that they were connected\r\nwith the crime----"\r\n\r\nM. Denizet returned to the murder.\r\n\r\n"Do you really think so?" he inquired.\r\n\r\n"Well, if they knew what was in the will, their interest in the death\r\nof our poor father is manifest. Observe, moreover, that they were the\r\nlast to speak to him. All this looks very suspicious."\r\n\r\nThe magistrate, out of patience, disturbed in his new hypothesis,\r\nturned to Berthe.\r\n\r\n"And you, madam? Do you think your old comrade capable of such a crime?"\r\n\r\nBefore answering, she looked at her husband. During their few months\r\nof married life, they had communicated to one another their ill-humour\r\nand want of feeling, which, moreover, had increased. They were becoming\r\nvitiated together. It was he who had set her on to S\xc3\xa9verine; and, to\r\nsuch a point, that to get back the house, she would have had her old\r\nplaymate arrested on the spot.\r\n\r\n"Well, sir," she ended by saying, "the person you speak about,\r\ndisplayed very bad tendencies as a child."\r\n\r\n"What were they? Do you accuse her of having acted improperly at\r\nDoinville?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! no, sir; my father would not have allowed her to remain."\r\n\r\nIn this sentence the prudery of the respectable middle-class lady,\r\nflared up in virtuous indignation.\r\n\r\n"Only," she continued, "when one notices a disposition to be giddy, to\r\nbe wild--briefly, many things that I should not have thought possible,\r\nappear to me positive at the present time."\r\n\r\nM. Denizet again showed signs of impatience. He was no longer following\r\nup this clue, and whoever continued to do so, became his adversary, and\r\nseemed to him to be putting the certainty of his intelligence in doubt.\r\n\r\n"But come!" he exclaimed; "one must yield to reason. People like the\r\nRoubauds would not kill such a man as your father, in order to inherit\r\nsooner; or, at least, there would be indications of them being in a\r\nhurry. I should find traces of this eagerness to possess and enjoy,\r\nelsewhere. No; the motive is insufficient. It is necessary to find\r\nanother, and there is nothing. You bring nothing yourselves. Then\r\nestablish the facts. Do you not perceive material impossibilities? No\r\none saw the Roubauds get into the coup\xc3\xa9. One of the staff even thinks\r\nhe can affirm that they returned to their compartment; and, as they\r\nwere certainly there at Barentin, it would be necessary to admit of a\r\ndouble journey between their carriage and that of the President, who\r\nwas separated from them by three coaches, during the few minutes it\r\nrequired to cover the distance, and while the train was going at full\r\nspeed. Does that seem likely? I have questioned drivers and guards.\r\nAll replied that long habit, alone, could give sufficient coolness\r\nand energy. In any case, the woman could not have been there. The\r\nhusband must have run the risk without her, and to do what? To kill a\r\nprotector who had just extricated him from serious embarrassment? No;\r\ndecidedly no! The presumption is inadmissible. We must look elsewhere.\r\nAh! Supposing a man, who got into the train at Rouen, and left it at\r\nthe next station, had recently uttered threats of death against the\r\nvictim----"\r\n\r\nIn his enthusiasm, he was coming to his new theory. He was on the point\r\nof saying too much about it, when the door was set ajar to make way for\r\nthe head of the usher; but, before the latter could utter a word, a\r\ngloved hand sent the door wide open, and a fair lady, attired in very\r\nelegant mourning, entered the room. She was still handsome at more than\r\nfifty years of age, but displayed the opulent and expansive beauty of a\r\ngoddess grown old.\r\n\r\n"It is I, my dear magistrate. I am behind time, and you must excuse me.\r\nThe roads are very bad; the three leagues from Doinville to Rouen are\r\nas good as six to-day."\r\n\r\nM. Denizet had risen gallantly from his seat.\r\n\r\n"I trust your health has been good, madam, since Sunday last?" said he.\r\n\r\n"Very good. And you, my dear magistrate, have got over the fright my\r\ncoachman gave you? The man told me the carriage got almost upset as he\r\ndrove you back, before he had gone a couple of miles from the ch\xc3\xa2teau."\r\n\r\n"Oh! merely a jolt. I had forgotten all about it. But pray be seated,\r\nand, as I just now said to Madame de Lachesnaye, pardon me for\r\nawakening your grief with this frightful business."\r\n\r\n"Well, as it has to be done----How do you do, Berthe? How do you do,\r\nLachesnaye?"\r\n\r\nIt was Madame Bonnehon, the sister of the victim. She had kissed her\r\nniece, and pressed the hand of the husband. The widow, since the age of\r\nthirty, of a manufacturer who had left her a large fortune, and already\r\nwealthy in her own right, having inherited the estate at Doinville in\r\nthe division of property between herself and her brother, she had led a\r\nmost pleasant existence, full of flirtations. But she was so correct,\r\nand so frank in appearance, that she had remained arbiter in Rouennais\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nAt times, and by taste, she had flirted with members of the bench.\r\nShe had been receiving the judicial world, at the ch\xc3\xa2teau, for the\r\nlast five-and-twenty years--all that swarm of functionaries at the\r\nLaw Courts whom her carriages brought from Rouen and carried back in\r\none continual round of festivities. At present, she had not calmed\r\ndown; she was credited with displaying maternal tenderness for a young\r\nsubstitute, son of a judge at the Court of Appeal, M. Chaumette. Whilst\r\nworking for the advancement of the son, she showered invitations and\r\nacts of kindness on the father. She had, moreover, preserved an admirer\r\nof the old days, also a judge, and a bachelor, M. Desbazeilles, the\r\nliterary glory of the Rouen Court of Appeal, whose cleverly turned\r\nsonnets were on every tongue. For years he had a room at Doinville.\r\nNow, although more than sixty, he still went to dinner there, as an\r\nold comrade, whose rheumatism only permitted him the recollection of\r\nhis past gallantry. She thus maintained her regal state by her good\r\ngrace, in spite of threatening old age, and no one thought of wresting\r\nit from her. Not before the previous winter had she felt a rival, a\r\nMadame Leboucq, the wife of another judge, whose house began to be much\r\nfrequented by members of the bench. This circumstance gave a tinge of\r\nmelancholy to her habitually gay life.\r\n\r\n"Then, madam, if you will permit me," resumed M. Denizet, "I\'ll just\r\nask you a few questions."\r\n\r\nThe examination of the Lachesnayes was at an end, but he did not send\r\nthem away. His cold, mournful apartment was taking the aspect of a\r\nfashionable drawing-room. The phlegmatic registrar again prepared to\r\nwrite.\r\n\r\n"One witness spoke of a telegram your brother is supposed to have\r\nreceived, summoning him at once to Doinville. We have found no trace of\r\nthis wire. Did you happen to write to him, madam?"\r\n\r\nMadame Bonnehon, quite at ease, gave her answer as if engaged in a\r\nfriendly chat.\r\n\r\n"I did not write to my brother," said she, "I was expecting him. I knew\r\nhe would be coming, but no date was fixed. He usually came suddenly,\r\nand generally by a night train. As he lodged in a pavilion apart, in\r\nthe park, opening on a deserted lane, we never even heard him arrive.\r\nHe engaged a trap at Barentin, and only put in an appearance the\r\nfollowing day, sometimes very late, like a neighbour in residence\r\nfor a long time, who looked in on a visit. If I expected him on this\r\noccasion, it was because he had to bring me a sum of 10,000 frcs., the\r\nbalance of an account we had together. He certainly had the 10,000\r\nfrcs. on him. And that is why I have always been of opinion that\r\nwhoever killed him, simply did so for the purpose of robbing him."\r\n\r\nThe magistrate allowed a short silence to follow; then, looking her in\r\nthe face, he inquired:\r\n\r\n"What do you think of Madame Roubaud and her husband?"\r\n\r\nMadame Bonnehon, making a rapid gesture of protestation, exclaimed:\r\n\r\n"Ah! no! my dear Monsieur Denizet, you must not allow yourself to be\r\nled astray again, in regard to those worthy people. S\xc3\xa9verine was a good\r\nlittle girl, very gentle, very docile even, and, moreover, delightfully\r\npretty, which was no disadvantage. It is my opinion, as you seem\r\nanxious for me to repeat what I have already said, that she and her\r\nhusband are incapable of a bad action."\r\n\r\nHe nodded in approbation. He triumphed. And he cast a glance towards\r\nMadame de Lachesnaye. The latter, piqued, took upon herself to\r\nintervene.\r\n\r\n"I think you are very easy for them, aunt!" she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n"Let be, Berthe," answered the latter; "we shall never agree on this\r\nsubject. She was gay, fond of mirth; and quite right too. I am well\r\naware of what you and your husband think. But really, the question of\r\ninterest must have turned your heads, for you to be so astounded at\r\nthis legacy of La Croix-de-Maufras from your father to poor S\xc3\xa9verine.\r\nHe brought her up, he gave her a marriage portion, and it was only\r\nnatural he should mention her in his will. Did he not look upon her as\r\nhis own daughter? Come! Ah! my dear, money counts for very little in\r\nthe matter of happiness!"\r\n\r\nShe, indeed, having always been very rich, was absolutely\r\ndisinterested. Moreover, with the refinement of a beautiful woman who\r\nwas very much admired, she affected to think beauty and love the only\r\nthings worth living for.\r\n\r\n"It was Roubaud who spoke of the telegram," remarked M. de Lachesnaye\r\ndrily. "If there was no telegram, the President could not have told him\r\nhe had received one. Why did Roubaud lie?"\r\n\r\n"But," exclaimed M. Denizet with feeling, "the President may have\r\ninvented this story of the telegram, himself, to explain his sudden\r\ndeparture to the Roubauds! According to their own evidence, he was\r\nonly to leave the next day; and, as he was in the same train as they\r\nwere, he had to give some explanation, if he did not wish to tell them\r\nthe real reason, which we all ignore, for that matter. This is without\r\nimportance; it leads to naught."\r\n\r\nAnother silence ensued. When the magistrate continued, he displayed\r\nmuch calm and precaution.\r\n\r\n"I am now, madam," said he, "about to approach a particularly delicate\r\nmatter, and I must beg you to excuse the nature of my questions. No\r\none respects the memory of your brother more than myself. There were\r\ncertain reports, were there not? It was pretended he had irregular\r\nconnections."\r\n\r\nMadame Bonnehon was smiling again with boundless toleration.\r\n\r\n"Oh! my dear sir, consider his age! My brother became a widower early.\r\nI never considered I had the right to interfere with what he thought\r\nfit to do. He therefore lived as he chose, without my meddling with his\r\nexistence in any way. What I do know is that he maintained his rank,\r\nand that to the end, he mixed in the best society."\r\n\r\nBerthe, choking at the idea that they should talk of her father\'s\r\nleft-handed connections in her presence, had cast down her eyes; whilst\r\nher husband, as uneasy as herself, had moved to the window, turning his\r\nback on the company.\r\n\r\n"Excuse me if I persist," said M. Denizet; "but was there not some\r\nstory about a young housemaid you had in your service?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! yes, Louisette. But, my dear sir, she was a depraved little\r\ncreature who, at fourteen, was on terms of intimacy with an ex-convict.\r\nAn attempt was made to cause a set out against my brother, in\r\nconnection with her death. It was infamous. I\'ll tell you the whole\r\nstory."\r\n\r\nNo doubt she spoke in good faith. Although she knew all about the\r\nPresident\'s habits, and had not been surprised at his tragic death,\r\nshe felt the necessity of defending the high position of the family.\r\nMoreover, in regard to this unfortunate business about Louisette, if\r\nshe thought him quite capable of having made advances to the young\r\ngirl, she was also convinced of her precocious depravity.\r\n\r\n"Picture to yourself a tiny thing, oh! so small, so delicate, blonde\r\nand rosy as a little angel, and gentle as well--the gentleness of a\r\nsaint, to whom one would have given the sacrament without confession.\r\nWell, before she was fourteen, she became the sweetheart of a sort\r\nof brute, a quarryman, named Cabuche, who had just done five years\'\r\nimprisonment for killing a man in a wine-shop. This fellow lived like\r\na savage on the fringe of B\xc3\xa9court forest, where his father, who had\r\ndied of grief, had left him a hut made of trunks of trees and earth.\r\nThere he obstinately worked a part of the abandoned quarries, that\r\nformerly, I believe, supplied half the stone with which Rouen is built.\r\nAnd it was in this lair that the girl went to join her ruffian, of\r\nwhom everyone in the district were so afraid that he lived absolutely\r\nalone, like a leper. Frequently they were met together, roving through\r\nthe woods, holding one another by the hand; she so dainty, he huge and\r\nbestial--briefly, a depravity one would hardly have believed possible.\r\nNaturally, I only heard of all this later. I had taken Louisette into\r\nmy service almost out of charity, to do a good action. Her family,\r\nthose Misards, whom I knew to be poor, were very careful to conceal\r\nfrom me that they had soundly flogged the child, without being able to\r\nprevent her running off to her Cabuche, as soon as a door stood open.\r\n\r\n"My brother had no servants of his own at Doinville. Louisette and\r\nanother woman did the housework in the detached pavilion which he\r\noccupied. One morning, when she had gone there alone, she disappeared.\r\nTo my mind, she had premeditated her flight long before. Perhaps her\r\nlover awaited her, and carried her off. But the horrifying part of the\r\nbusiness was that five days later, came the report of the death of\r\nLouisette, along with details of a rape, attempted by my brother, under\r\nsuch monstrous circumstances that the child, out of her mind, had gone\r\nto Cabuche, where she had died of brain fever. What had happened? So\r\nmany different versions were put about that it is difficult to say.\r\nFor my part, I believe that Louisette, who really died of pernicious\r\nfever, for this was established by a doctor, had been guilty of some\r\nimprudence, such as sleeping out in the open air, or wandering like a\r\nvagabond among the marshes. You, my dear sir, you cannot, yourself,\r\nconceive my brother torturing this mite of a girl. It is odious,\r\nimpossible."\r\n\r\nM. Denizet had listened to this version of the business without either\r\napproving or disapproving. And Madame Bonnehon experienced some slight\r\nembarrassment in coming to an end. But, making up her mind, she added:\r\n\r\n"Of course, I do not mean to say that my brother did not joke with\r\nher. He liked young people. He was very gay, notwithstanding his rigid\r\nexterior. Briefly, let us say he kissed her."\r\n\r\nAt this word, the Lachesnayes protested in virtuous indignation.\r\n\r\n"Oh! aunt, aunt!"\r\n\r\nBut she shrugged her shoulders. Why should she tell the magistrate\r\nfalsehoods?\r\n\r\n"He kissed her, tickled her, perhaps. There is no crime in that. And\r\nwhat makes me admit this, is that the invention does not come from the\r\nquarryman. Louisette must be the falsehood-teller, the vicious creature\r\nwho exaggerated things, in order to get her lover to keep her with him,\r\nperhaps. So that the latter, a brute, as I have told you, ended in\r\ngood faith by imagining that we had killed his sweetheart. In fact he\r\nwas mad with rage, and repeated in all the drinking-places that if the\r\nPresident fell into his hands, he would bleed him like a pig."\r\n\r\nThe magistrate, who had been silent up to then, interrupted her sharply.\r\n\r\n"He said that? Are there any witnesses to prove it?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! my dear sir, you will be able to find as many as you please. In\r\nconclusion, it was a very sad business, and caused us a great deal of\r\nannoyance. Fortunately, the position of my brother placed him beyond\r\nsuspicion."\r\n\r\nMadame Bonnehon had just discovered the new clue that M. Denizet was\r\nfollowing, and this made her rather anxious. She preferred not to\r\nventure further, by questioning him in her turn. He had risen, and\r\nsaid he would not take any further advantage of the civility of the\r\nfamily in their painful position. By his orders, the registrar read\r\nover the examinations of the witnesses, before they signed them. They\r\nwere perfectly correct, so thoroughly purged of all unnecessary and\r\nentangling words that Madame Bonnehon, with her pen in her hand, cast\r\na glance of benevolent surprise at this pallid, bony Laurent, whom she\r\nhad not yet looked at.\r\n\r\nThen, as the magistrate accompanied her, along with her niece and\r\nnephew-in-law, to the door, she pressed his hands with the remark:\r\n\r\n"I shall soon see you again, I hope. You know you are always welcome\r\nat Doinville. And, thanks for coming; you are one of my last faithful\r\nones."\r\n\r\nHer smile became quite melancholy. But her niece, who had walked out\r\nstiffly the first, had only made a slight inclination of her head to\r\nthe magistrate.\r\n\r\nWhen they were gone M. Denizet breathed for a moment. He remained\r\non his feet, thinking. To his mind the matter was becoming clear.\r\nGrandmorin, whose reputation was well known, had certainly acted\r\nimproperly. This made the inquiry a delicate matter. He determined to\r\nbe more prudent than ever, until the communication he was expecting\r\nfrom the Ministry reached him. But none the less, he triumphed; anyhow\r\nhe held the culprit.\r\n\r\nWhen he had resumed his seat at the writing-table, he rang up the usher.\r\n\r\n"Bring me the driver Jacques Lantier," said he.\r\n\r\nThe Roubauds were still waiting on the bench in the corridor, with\r\nfixed countenances, as if their protracted patience had set them\r\ndozing; but their faces were occasionally disturbed by a nervous\r\ntwitch, and the voice of the usher, calling Jacques, seemed to make\r\nthem slightly shudder, as they roused themselves. They followed the\r\ndriver with expanded eyes, watching him disappear in the room of the\r\nmagistrate. Then they fell into their former attitude--paler, and\r\nsilent.\r\n\r\nFor the last three weeks, Jacques had been pursued by the uncomfortable\r\nfeeling that all this business might end by turning against him. This\r\nwas unreasonable, for there was naught he could reproach himself\r\nwith, not even with keeping silent. And yet he entered the room of\r\nthe examining-magistrate with that little creeping sensation of a\r\nguilty person, who fears his crime may be discovered, and he defended\r\nhimself against the questions that were put to him; he was cautious in\r\nhis answers, lest he might say too much. He, also, might have killed;\r\nwas this not visible in his eyes? Nothing was so repugnant to him as\r\nthese summonses to the justice-room. He experienced a sort of anger\r\nat receiving them, saying he was anxious to be no longer tormented by\r\nmatters that did not concern him.\r\n\r\nBut, on this occasion, M. Denizet only dwelt upon the subject of the\r\ndescription of the murderer. Jacques, being the single witness who had\r\ncaught sight of him, could alone supply precise information. But he did\r\nnot depart from what he had said at his first examination. He repeated\r\nthat the scene of the murder had been a vision which had barely lasted\r\na second, a picture that came and went so rapidly that it had remained\r\nas if without form, in the abstract, in his recollection. It was merely\r\none man slaughtering another, and nothing more. For half an hour, the\r\njudge pestered him with patient persistence, questioning him in every\r\nimaginable sense. Was he a big or a small man? Had he a beard? Did he\r\nwear his hair long or short? What were his clothes like? To what class\r\nof people did he appear to belong? And Jacques, who was uneasy, only\r\ngave vague replies.\r\n\r\n"Look here," abruptly inquired M. Denizet, staring him full in the\r\neyes, "if he were shown to you, would you recognise him?"\r\n\r\nHe blinked slightly, seized with anguish under the influence of that\r\npiercing gaze, searching in his very brain. His conscience spoke aloud:\r\n\r\n"Know him? Yes, perhaps."\r\n\r\nBut, immediately, his strange fear of unconscious complicity plunged\r\nhim into his evasive system again, and he continued:\r\n\r\n"But no; I don\'t think so. I should never dare say positively. Just\r\nreflect! A speed of sixty miles an hour!"\r\n\r\nWith a gesture of discouragement, the magistrate was about to send him\r\ninto the adjoining room to keep him at his disposal, when, changing his\r\nmind, he said:\r\n\r\n"Remain here. Sit down."\r\n\r\nAnd, ringing for the usher, he told him to introduce M. and Madame\r\nRoubaud.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they were at the doorway and saw Jacques, their eyes\r\nlost their brilliancy in a feeling of vacillating anxiety. Had he\r\nspoken? Was he detained so as to be confronted with them? All their\r\nself-assurance vanished at the knowledge that he was there, and it was\r\nin a rather low voice that they began to give their answers. But the\r\nmagistrate had simply turned to their first examination. They merely\r\nhad to repeat the same sentences, almost identical, whilst M. Denizet\r\nlistened with bowed head, without even looking at them. All at once, he\r\nturned to S\xc3\xa9verine.\r\n\r\n"Madam," said he, "you told the commissary of police at the railway\r\nstation, whose report I have here, that you had the idea, that a man\r\ngot into the coup\xc3\xa9 at Rouen, as the train began to move."\r\n\r\nShe was thunderstruck. Why did he recall that? Was it a snare? Was he\r\nabout to compare one answer with another, and so make her contradict\r\nherself? And, with a glance, she consulted her husband who prudently\r\nintervened.\r\n\r\n"I do not think my wife was quite so positive, sir," he remarked.\r\n\r\n"Excuse me," replied the magistrate, "you suggested the thing was\r\npossible, and madam said, \'That is certainly what happened.\' Now,\r\nmadam, I want to know whether you had any particular reasons for\r\nspeaking as you did?"\r\n\r\nShe was now completely upset, convinced that if she did not take care,\r\nhe would, from one answer to another, bring her to a confession.\r\nHowbeit, she could not remain silent.\r\n\r\n"Oh! no, sir!" she exclaimed; "no reason. I merely said that by way of\r\nargument, because, in fact, it is difficult to explain the matter in\r\nany other way."\r\n\r\n"Then you did not see the man. You can tell us nothing about him?"\r\n\r\n"No, no, sir, nothing!"\r\n\r\nM. Denizet seemed to abandon this point in the inquiry. But he at once\r\nreturned to it with Roubaud.\r\n\r\n"And you? How is it that you did not see the man, if he really got into\r\nthe coup\xc3\xa9, for, according to your own deposition, you were talking to\r\nthe victim when they whistled to send the train off?"\r\n\r\nThis persistence had the effect of terrifying the assistant\r\nstation-master, in his anxiety to decide what course he ought to\r\ntake--whether he should set aside his invention about the other man,\r\nor obstinately cling to it. If they had proofs against himself, the\r\ntheory concerning the unknown murderer could hardly be maintained,\r\nand might even aggravate his own case. He gained time, until he could\r\nunderstand what was going on, answering in detail with confused\r\nexplanations.\r\n\r\n"It is really unfortunate," resumed M. Denizet, "that your recollection\r\nis not more distinct, for you might help us to put an end to suspicions\r\nthat have spread to several persons."\r\n\r\nThis seemed such a direct thrust at Roubaud that he felt an\r\nirresistible desire to establish his own innocence. Imagining himself\r\ndiscovered, he immediately made up his mind.\r\n\r\n"This point is so thoroughly a matter of conscience," said he, "that\r\none hesitates, you understand; nothing is more natural. Supposing I\r\nwere to confess to you that I really believe I saw the man----"\r\n\r\nThe magistrate gave a gesture of triumph, thinking this commencement of\r\nfrankness due to his own ability. He had frequently remarked that he\r\nknew, by experience, what strange difficulty some witnesses found in\r\ndivulging what they knew, and he flattered himself he could make this\r\nclass of people unburden themselves, in spite of all.\r\n\r\n"Go on. How was he? Short, tall, about your own height?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! no, no, much taller. At least, that was my sensation, for it was a\r\nsimple sensation, an individual I am almost sure I brushed against, as\r\nI ran back to my own carriage."\r\n\r\n"Wait a moment," said M. Denizet.\r\n\r\nAnd, turning to Jacques, he inquired:\r\n\r\n"The man you caught sight of, with the knife in his hand, was he taller\r\nthan Monsieur Roubaud?"\r\n\r\nThe driver, who was impatient, for he began to be afraid he would not\r\ncatch the five o\'clock train, raised his eyes and examined Roubaud.\r\nAnd, it seemed to him, that he had never looked at him before. He was\r\nastonished to find him short, powerful, with a peculiar profile he had\r\nseen elsewhere, perhaps in a dream.\r\n\r\n"No," he murmured, "not taller; about the same height."\r\n\r\nBut the assistant station master vehemently protested.\r\n\r\n"Oh! much taller! At least a head."\r\n\r\nJacques fixed his eyes, wide open, upon him. And under the influence\r\nof this look, wherein he read increasing surprise, Roubaud became\r\nagitated, as if to change his own appearance; while his wife also\r\nfollowed the dull effort of memory expressed by the face of the young\r\nman. Clearly the latter was astonished. First of all, at certain\r\nanalogies between Roubaud and the murderer. Then he abruptly became\r\npositive that Roubaud was the assassin, as had been reported. He\r\nnow seemed troubled at this discovery, and stood there with gaping\r\ncountenance, unable to decide what to do. If he spoke, the couple were\r\nlost. The eyes of Roubaud had met his. They penetrated one another to\r\ntheir innermost thoughts. There came a silence.\r\n\r\n"Then you do not agree?" resumed M. Denizet, addressing Jacques. "If,\r\nin your sight, he appeared shorter, it was no doubt because he was bent\r\nin the struggle with his victim."\r\n\r\nHe also looked at the two men. It had not occurred to him to make use\r\nof this confrontation; but, by professional instinct, he felt, at this\r\nmoment, that truth was flitting away. His confidence was even shaken\r\nin the Cabuche clue. Could it be possible that the Lachesnayes were\r\nright? Could it be possible that the guilty parties, contrary to all\r\nappearance, were this upright employ\xc3\xa9, and his gentle young wife?\r\n\r\n"Did the man wear all his beard, like you?" he inquired of Roubaud.\r\n\r\nThe latter had the strength to answer in a steady voice:\r\n\r\n"All his beard? No, no! I think he had no beard at all."\r\n\r\nJacques understood that the same question was about to be put to him.\r\nWhat should he say? He could have sworn the man had a full beard. After\r\nall, he was not interested in these people, why not tell the truth?\r\nBut as he took his eyes off the husband, he met those of the wife, and\r\nin her look he read such ardent supplication, such an absolute gift of\r\nall her being, that he felt quite overcome. His old shiver came on him.\r\nDid he love her? Was she the one he could love, as one loves for love\'s\r\nsake, without a monstrous desire for destruction? And, at this moment,\r\nby singular counter-action in his trouble, it seemed to him that his\r\nmemory had become obscured. He no longer saw the murderer in Roubaud.\r\nThe vision was again vague; he doubted, and to such an extent that he\r\nmortally regretted having spoken.\r\n\r\nM. Denizet put the question:\r\n\r\n"Had the man a full beard like Monsieur Roubaud?"\r\n\r\nAnd he replied in good faith:\r\n\r\n"Sir, in truth, I cannot say. Once more, it was too rapid: I know\r\nnothing. I will affirm nothing."\r\n\r\nBut M. Denizet proved tenacious, for he wished to clear up the\r\nsuspicion cast on the assistant station-master. He plied both Roubaud\r\nand the driver with questions, and ended by getting a complete\r\ndescription of the murderer from the former: tall, robust, no beard,\r\nattired in a blouse--quite the reverse of his own appearance in every\r\nparticular. But the driver only answered in evasive monosyllables,\r\nwhich imparted strength to the statements of the other. And the\r\nmagistrate returned to the conviction he had formed at first. He was on\r\nthe right track. The portrait the witness drew of the assassin was so\r\nexact that each new feature added to the certainty. It was the crushing\r\ntestimony of this unjustly suspected couple, that would lay the head of\r\nthe culprit low.\r\n\r\n"Step in there," said he to the Roubauds and Jacques, showing them into\r\nthe adjoining room, when they had signed their examinations. "Wait till\r\nI call you."\r\n\r\nHe immediately gave orders for the prisoner to be brought in, and\r\nhe was so delighted, that he went to the length of remarking to his\r\nregistrar:\r\n\r\n"Laurent, we\'ve got him."\r\n\r\nBut the door had opened, two gendarmes had appeared bringing in a\r\ngreat, big fellow between twenty-five and thirty. At a sign from the\r\nmagistrate, they withdrew, and Cabuche, bewildered, remained alone\r\nin the centre of the apartment, bristling like a wild beast at bay.\r\nHe was a sturdy, thick-necked fellow, with enormous fists, and fair,\r\nwith a very white skin. He had hardly any hair on his face, barely a\r\ngolden down, curly and silken. The massive features, the low forehead,\r\nindicated the violent character of a being of limited brains, but a\r\nsort of desire to be tenderly submissive was shown in the broad mouth\r\nand square nose, as in those of a good dog.\r\n\r\nSeized brutally in his den in the early morning, torn from his forest,\r\nexasperated at accusations which he did not understand, he had already,\r\nwith his wild look and rent blouse, all the suspicious air of a\r\nprisoner in the dock--that air of a cunning bandit which the jail gives\r\nto the most honest man. Night was drawing in, the room was dark, and he\r\nhad slunk into the shadow, when the usher brought a big lamp, having a\r\nglobe without a shade, whose bright light lit up his countenance. Then\r\nhe remained uncovered, and motionless.\r\n\r\nM. Denizet at once fixed his great, heavy-lidded eyes on him. And he\r\ndid not speak. This was the dumb engagement, the preliminary trial of\r\nhis power, before entering on the warfare of the savage, the warfare\r\nof stratagem, of snares, of moral torture. This man was the culprit,\r\neverything became lawful against him. He had now no other right than\r\nthat of confessing his crime.\r\n\r\nThe cross-examination commenced very slowly.\r\n\r\n"Do you know of what crime you are accused?"\r\n\r\nCabuche, in a voice thick with impotent anger, grumbled:\r\n\r\n"No one has told me, but I can easily guess. There has been enough talk\r\nabout it!"\r\n\r\n"You knew Monsieur Grandmorin?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes; I knew him, only too well!"\r\n\r\n"A girl named Louisette, your sweetheart, went as housemaid to Madame\r\nBonnehon?"\r\n\r\nThe quarryman flew into a frightful rage. In his anger, he was ready to\r\nshed blood.\r\n\r\n"Those who say that," he exclaimed with an oath, "are liars! Louisette\r\nwas not my sweetheart."\r\n\r\nThe magistrate watched him lose his temper with curiosity. And giving a\r\nturn to the examination, remarked:\r\n\r\n"You are very violent. You were sentenced to five years\' imprisonment\r\nfor killing a man in a quarrel?"\r\n\r\nCabuche hung his head. That sentence was his shame. He murmured:\r\n\r\n"He struck first. I only did four years; they let me off one."\r\n\r\n"So," resumed M. Denizet, "you pretend that the girl Louisette was not\r\nyour sweetheart?"\r\n\r\nAgain Cabuche clenched his fists. Then in a low, broken voice, he\r\nreplied:\r\n\r\n"You must know that when I came back from there, she was a child, under\r\nfourteen. At that time everyone fled from me. They would have stoned\r\nme; and she, in the forest, where I was always meeting her, approached\r\nme, and talked; she was so nice--oh! so nice! It was like that we\r\nbecame friends; we walked about holding each other by the hand. It was\r\nso pleasant--so pleasant in those days. Of course she was growing,\r\nand I thought of her. I can\'t say the contrary. I was like a madman I\r\nloved her so. She was very fond of me, too, and in the end what you\r\nmean would have happened, but they separated her from me by placing\r\nher at Doinville with this lady. Then, one night, on coming from the\r\nquarry, I found her before my door, half out of her mind, so dreadfully\r\nupset that she was burning with fever. She had not dared return to her\r\nparents; she had come to die at my place. Ah! the pig! I ought to have\r\nrun and bled him at once!"\r\n\r\nThe magistrate pinched his artful lips, astonished at the sincere tone\r\nof the man. Decidedly he would have to play a close game, he had to\r\ndeal with a stronger hand than he had thought.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said he, "I know all about the frightful story that you and this\r\ngirl invented. Only, observe that the whole life of Monsieur Grandmorin\r\nplaces him above your accusations."\r\n\r\nAgitated, his eyes round with astonishment, his hands trembling, the\r\nquarryman stammered:\r\n\r\n"What? What did we invent? It\'s the others who lie, and we are accused\r\nof doing so!"\r\n\r\n"Indeed!" observed the examining-magistrate. "Do not try to act the\r\ninnocent. I have already questioned Misard, the man who married the\r\nmother of your sweetheart. I will confront him with you if it be\r\nnecessary; you will see what he thinks of your tale, and be careful of\r\nyour answers. We have witnesses, we know all. You had much better tell\r\nthe truth."\r\n\r\nThese were his usual tactics of intimidation, even when he knew\r\nnothing, and had no witnesses.\r\n\r\n"Now, do you deny having shouted out in public, everywhere, that you\r\nwould bleed Monsieur Grandmorin?" inquired M. Denizet.\r\n\r\n"Ah! as to that, yes, I did say it. And I said it from the bottom of my\r\nheart; for my hand was jolly well itching to do it!" answered Cabuche.\r\n\r\nM. Denizet stopped short in surprise, having expected to meet with a\r\nsystem of complete denial. What! the accused owned up to the threats?\r\nWhat stratagem did that conceal? Fearing he might have been too hasty,\r\nhe collected himself a moment, then, staring Cabuche full in the face,\r\nhe abruptly put this question to him:\r\n\r\n"What were you doing on the night of the 14th to the 15th of February?"\r\n\r\n"I went to bed at dark, about six o\'clock," replied the quarryman. "I\r\nwas rather unwell, and my cousin Louis did me the service to take a\r\nload of stones to Doinville."\r\n\r\n"Yes, your cousin was seen, with the cart, passing over the line at the\r\nlevel crossing," remarked the magistrate; "but on being questioned, he\r\ncould only make one reply, namely, that you left him about noon, and he\r\ndid not see you again. Prove to me that you were in bed at six o\'clock."\r\n\r\n"Look here, that\'s stupid," protested Cabuche. "I cannot prove that. I\r\nlive all alone in a house at the edge of the forest. I was there, I say\r\nso, and nothing more."\r\n\r\nThen M. Denizet decided on playing his trump card of assertion, which\r\nwas calculated to impose on the party. His face, by a tension of will,\r\nbecame rigid, whilst his mouth performed the scene.\r\n\r\n"I am going to tell you what you did on the night of February 14th,"\r\nsaid he. "At three o\'clock in the afternoon, you took the train for\r\nRouen, at Barentin, with what object the inquiry has not revealed. You\r\nhad the intention of returning by the Paris train, which stops at Rouen\r\nat 9.03; and while on the platform, amid the crowd, you caught sight of\r\nMonsieur Grandmorin in his coup\xc3\xa9. Observe that I am willing to admit\r\nthere was no laying in wait for the victim, that the idea of the crime\r\nonly occurred to you when you saw him. You entered the coup\xc3\xa9, thanks\r\nto the crush, and waited until you were in the Malaunay tunnel. But\r\nyou miscalculated the time, for the train was issuing from the tunnel\r\nwhen you dealt the blow. And you threw out the corpse, and you left the\r\ntrain at Barentin, after having got rid of the travelling-rug as well.\r\nThat is what you did."\r\n\r\nHe watched for the slightest ripple on the rosy face of Cabuche, and\r\nwas irritated when the latter, who had been very attentive at first,\r\nended by bursting into a hearty laugh.\r\n\r\n"What\'s that you\'re relating?" he exclaimed. "If I\'d struck the blow\r\nI\'d say so."\r\n\r\nThen he quietly added:\r\n\r\n"I did not do it, but I ought to have done it. Yes, I\'m sorry I didn\'t."\r\n\r\nAnd that was all M. Denizet could get out of him. In vain did he repeat\r\nhis questions, returning ten times to the same points by different\r\ntactics. No; always no! it was not he. He shrugged his shoulders,\r\nsaying the idea was stupid. On arresting him they had searched the\r\nhovel, without discovering either weapon, banknotes, or watch. But\r\nthey had laid hands on a pair of trousers, soiled with a few drops of\r\nblood--an overwhelming proof.\r\n\r\nAgain he began to laugh. That was another pretty yarn! A rabbit,\r\ncaught in a noose, had bled down his leg! And it was the magistrate\r\nwho, in his unswerving conviction of the guilt of the prisoner, was\r\nlosing ground by the display of too much professional astuteness, by\r\ncomplicating matters, by deposing simple truth. This man of small\r\nbrains, incapable of holding his own in an effort of cunning, of\r\ninvincible strength when he said no, always no, almost drove him\r\ncrazy; for he was positive of the culpability of the man, and each\r\nfresh denial made him the more indignant at what he looked upon as\r\nobstinate perseverance in savagery and lies. He would force him into\r\ncontradicting himself.\r\n\r\n"So you deny it?" he said.\r\n\r\n"Of course I do, because it was not me," said Cabuche. "Had it been,\r\nah! I should be only too proud, I should say it was me."\r\n\r\nM. Denizet abruptly rose, and opened the door of the small adjoining\r\nroom. When he had summoned Jacques, he inquired:\r\n\r\n"Do you recognise this man?"\r\n\r\n"I know him," answered the driver, surprised. "I\'ve seen him formerly\r\nat the Misards."\r\n\r\n"No, no," said the magistrate. "Do you recognise him as the man in the\r\ncoup\xc3\xa9, the murderer?"\r\n\r\nAt once, Jacques became circumspect. As a matter of fact, he did not\r\nrecognise the man. The other seemed to him shorter, darker. He was\r\nabout to say so, when it struck him that even this might be going too\r\nfar. And he continued evasively.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, I can\'t say; I assure you, sir, that I cannot say."\r\n\r\nM. Denizet, without waiting, called the Roubauds in their turn, and put\r\nthe same question to them.\r\n\r\n"Do you recognise this man?"\r\n\r\nCabuche continued smiling. He was not surprised. He nodded to\r\nS\xc3\xa9verine, whom he had known as a young girl when she resided at\r\nLa Croix-de-Maufras. But she and her husband had felt a pang, on\r\nperceiving him there. They understood. This was the man taken into\r\ncustody, of whom Jacques had spoken, the prisoner who had caused\r\nthis fresh examination. And Roubaud was astounded, terrified at the\r\nresemblance of this fellow to the imaginary murderer, whose description\r\nhe had invented, the reverse of his own. It was pure chance, but it so\r\ntroubled him that he hesitated to reply.\r\n\r\n"Come, do you recognise him?" repeated the magistrate.\r\n\r\n"Sir," answered Roubaud, "I can only say again that it was a simple\r\nsensation, an individual who brushed against me. Of course this man is\r\ntall, like the other, and he is fair, and has no beard."\r\n\r\n"Anyhow, do you recognise him?" asked M. Denizet again.\r\n\r\n"I cannot say positively. But there is a resemblance, a good deal of\r\nresemblance, certainly."\r\n\r\nThis time Cabuche began to swear. He had had enough of these yarns. As\r\nhe was not the culprit, he wanted to be off. And the blood flying to\r\nhis head, he struck the table with his fists. He became so terrible\r\nthat the gendarmes, who were called in, led him away. But in presence\r\nof this violence, of this leap of the beast who dashes forward\r\nwhen attacked, M. Denizet triumphed. His conviction was now firmly\r\nestablished, and he allowed this to be seen.\r\n\r\n"Did you notice his eyes?" he inquired. "It\'s by the eyes that I tell\r\nthem. Ah! his measure is full. We\'ve got him!"\r\n\r\nThe Roubauds, remaining motionless, exchanged glances. What now? It\r\nwas all over. As justice had the culprit in its grip, they were saved.\r\nThey felt a trifle bewildered, their consciences were pricked at the\r\npart events had just compelled them to play. But overwhelmed with joy,\r\nthey made short work of their scruples, and they smiled at Jacques.\r\nConsiderably relieved, eager for the open air, they were waiting for\r\nthe magistrate to dismiss all three of them, when the usher brought him\r\na letter.\r\n\r\nIn a moment M. Denizet, oblivious of the three witnesses, was at his\r\nwriting-table, perusing the communication. It was the letter from the\r\nMinistry containing the indications he should have had the patience\r\nto await before resuming the inquiry. What he read must have lessened\r\nhis feeling of triumph, for his countenance, little by little, became\r\nfrigid, and resumed its sad immobility. At a certain moment he raised\r\nhis head, to cast a glance sideways at the Roubauds, as if one of the\r\nphrases reminded him of them. The latter, bereft of their brief joy,\r\nonce more became a prey to uneasiness, feeling themselves caught again.\r\n\r\nWhy had he looked at them? Had the three lines of writing--that clumsy\r\nnote which haunted them--been found in Paris? S\xc3\xa9verine was well\r\nacquainted with M. Camy-Lamotte, having frequently seen him at the\r\nhouse of the President, and she was aware that he had been entrusted\r\nwith the duty of sorting his papers. Roubaud was tortured by the\r\nkeenest regret that the idea had not occurred to him to dispatch his\r\nwife to Paris, where she might have paid useful visits, and at the\r\nleast made sure of the support of the secretary to the Ministry, in\r\ncase the company, annoyed at the nasty rumours in circulation, should\r\nthink of dismissing him. Thenceforth, neither of them took their eyes\r\noff the magistrate, and their anxiety increased as they noticed him\r\nbecome gloomy, visibly disconcerted at this letter which upset all his\r\ngood day\'s work.\r\n\r\nAt last, M. Denizet left the letter, and for a moment remained\r\nabsorbed, his eyes wide open, resting on the Roubauds and Jacques.\r\nThen, submitting to the inevitable, speaking aloud to himself, he\r\nexclaimed:\r\n\r\n"Well, we shall see! We shall have to return to all this! You can\r\nwithdraw."\r\n\r\nBut as the three were going out, he could not resist the desire to\r\nlearn more, to throw light on the grave point which destroyed his new\r\ntheory, although he was recommended to do nothing further, without\r\npreviously coming to an understanding with the authorities.\r\n\r\n"No; you remain here a minute," said he, addressing the driver. "I\'ve\r\nanother question to put to you."\r\n\r\nThe Roubauds stopped in the corridor. They were free, and yet they\r\ncould not go. Something detained them there: the anguish to learn what\r\nwas passing in the magistrate\'s room, the physical impossibility to\r\ndepart before ascertaining from Jacques, what the other question was\r\nthat had been put to him. They turned and turned, they beat time with\r\ntheir worn out legs; and they found themselves again side by side, on\r\nthe bench where they had already waited for hours. There they sat,\r\ndowncast and silent.\r\n\r\nWhen the driver reappeared, Roubaud rose with effort.\r\n\r\n"We were waiting for you," said he. "We\'ll go to the station together.\r\nWell?"\r\n\r\nBut Jacques turned his head aside, in embarrassment, as if wishing to\r\navoid the eyes of S\xc3\xa9verine which were fixed on him.\r\n\r\n"He\'s all at sea, floundering about," he ended by saying. "Look here,\r\nhe is now asking me whether there were not two who did the deed. And,\r\nas at Havre, I spoke of a black mass weighing on the old chap\'s legs.\r\nHe questioned me on the point; he seems to fancy it was only the rug.\r\nThen he sent for it, and I had to express an opinion. Well, now, yes,\r\nwhen I come to think, perhaps it was the rug."\r\n\r\nThe Roubauds shuddered. They were on their track; one word from this\r\nman might ruin them. He certainly knew, and he would end by talking.\r\nAnd all three, the woman between the two men, left the Law Courts in\r\nsilence. In the street the assistant station-master observed: "By the\r\nway, comrade, my wife will be obliged to go to Paris, for a day, on\r\nbusiness. It would be very good of you, if you would look after her,\r\nshould she be in need of someone."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\nPrecisely at 11.15, the advertised time, the signalman at the Pont\r\nde l\'Europe, gave the two regulation blows of the horn, to announce\r\nthe Havre express, which issued from the Batignolles tunnel. Soon\r\nafterwards the turn-tables rattled, and the train entered the station\r\nwith a short whistle, grating on the brakes, smoking, shining, dripping\r\nwith the beating rain that had not ceased since leaving Rouen.\r\n\r\nThe porters had not yet turned the handles of the doors, when one\r\nof them opened, and S\xc3\xa9verine sprang lightly to the platform, before\r\nthe train had stopped. Her carriage was at the end. To reach the\r\nlocomotive, she had to hurry through the swarm of passengers,\r\nembarrassed by children and packages, who had suddenly left the\r\ncompartments. Jacques stood there, erect on the foot-plate, waiting to\r\ngo to the engine-house; while Pecqueux wiped the brasswork with a cloth.\r\n\r\n"So it is understood," said she, on tiptoe. "I will be at the Rue\r\nCardinet at three o\'clock, and you will have the kindness to introduce\r\nme to your chief, so that I may thank him."\r\n\r\nThis was the pretext imagined by Roubaud: a visit to the head of the\r\ndep\xc3\xb4t at Batignolles, to thank him for some vague service he had\r\nrendered. In this manner she would find herself confided to the good\r\nfriendship of the driver. She could strengthen the bonds, and exert her\r\ninfluence over him.\r\n\r\nBut Jacques, black with coal, drenched with water, exhausted by the\r\nstruggle against rain and wind, stared at her with his harsh eyes,\r\nwithout answering. On leaving Havre, he had been unable to refuse the\r\nrequest of the husband to look after her; and this idea of finding\r\nhimself alone in her company upset him, for he now felt that he was\r\nvery decidedly falling in love with her.\r\n\r\n"Is that right?" she resumed, smiling, with her sweet, caressing look,\r\novercoming her surprise and slight repugnance at finding him so dirty,\r\nbarely recognisable. "Is that right? I shall rely on your being there."\r\n\r\nAnd, as she raised herself a little higher, resting her gloved hand on\r\none of the iron handles, Pecqueux obligingly interfered:\r\n\r\n"Take care, you will dirty yourself," said he.\r\n\r\nThen Jacques had to answer, and he did so in a surly tone.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Rue Cardinet, unless I get drowned in this abominable rain. What\r\nhorrid weather!"\r\n\r\nShe felt touched at his wretched appearance, and added, as if he had\r\nsuffered solely for her:\r\n\r\n"Oh! what a dreadful state you are in! And I was so comfortable. I was\r\nthinking of you, you know; and that deluge of rain quite distressed\r\nme. I felt very pleased at the idea that you were bringing me up this\r\nmorning, and would take me back to-night, by the express."\r\n\r\nBut this familiarity, so tender and so nice, only seemed to trouble him\r\nthe more. He appeared relieved when a voice shouted, "Back!" Promptly\r\nhe blew the whistle, while the fireman made a sign to the young woman\r\nto stand back.\r\n\r\n"At three o\'clock!"\r\n\r\n"Yes; at three o\'clock!"\r\n\r\nAnd as the locomotive moved along, S\xc3\xa9verine left the platform, the last\r\nof the passengers. Outside, in the Rue d\'Amsterdam, as she was about\r\nto open her umbrella, she was glad to find it had ceased raining. She\r\nwalked down to the Place du Havre, where she stood reflecting for an\r\ninstant, and at last decided that it would be best to lunch at once.\r\nIt was twenty-five minutes past eleven. She stepped into a little\r\nrestaurant at the corner of the Rue Saint Lazare, where she ordered a\r\ncouple of fried eggs and a cutlet. Then, whilst eating very slowly, she\r\nfell into reflections that had been haunting her for weeks, her face\r\npale and cloudy, and bereft of its docile, seductive smile.\r\n\r\nIt was on the previous evening, two days after their examination at\r\nRouen, that Roubaud, judging it dangerous to wait, had resolved to\r\nsend her on a visit to M. Camy-Lamotte, not at the Ministry, but at\r\nhis private residence, Rue du Rocher, where he occupied a house close\r\nto that of the late President Grandmorin. She knew she would find him\r\nthere at one o\'clock, and she did not hurry. She was preparing what she\r\nshould say, endeavouring to foresee what he would answer, so as not to\r\nget troubled at anything that might transpire.\r\n\r\nThe evening before, a new cause of anxiety had hastened her journey.\r\nThey had learnt, from gossip at the station, that Madame Lebleu and\r\nPhilom\xc3\xa8ne were relating everywhere that the company was going to\r\ndismiss Roubaud, who was considered involved. And the worst of it was\r\nthat M. Dabadie, who had been questioned point blank, had not answered\r\nno, which gave considerable weight to the news. From that moment it\r\nbecame urgent that she should hurry off to Paris to plead their cause,\r\nand particularly to solicit the protection of the powerful personage in\r\nquestion, as on former occasions she had sought that of the President.\r\n\r\nBut, apart from this request, which anyhow would serve to explain her\r\nvisit, there was a more imperative motive--a burning and insatiable\r\nhankering to know, that hankering which drives the criminal to give\r\nhimself away rather than remain ignorant. The uncertainty was killing\r\nthem, now that they felt themselves discovered, since Jacques had\r\ntold them of the suspicion which the judicial authorities seemed to\r\nentertain of there being an accomplice. They were lost in conjectures:\r\nhad the letter been found, the facts established? Hour by hour they\r\nexpected a search would be made at their lodgings, that they would be\r\narrested; and their burden became so heavy, the least occurrence in\r\ntheir surroundings assumed an air of such alarming menace, that in the\r\nend they preferred the catastrophe to this constant apprehension, to\r\nhave a certainty and no longer suffer.\r\n\r\nWhen S\xc3\xa9verine had finished her cutlet, she was so absorbed that she\r\nawoke almost with a start to reality, astonished to find herself in a\r\npublic room. Everything seemed bitter. Her food stuck in her throat,\r\nand she had no heart to take coffee. Although she had eaten slowly, it\r\nwas barely a quarter past twelve, when she left the restaurant. Another\r\nthree-quarters of an hour to kill! She who adored Paris, who was so\r\nfond of rambling through the streets, freely, on the rare occasions\r\nwhen she visited the capital, now felt lost, timid, and was full of\r\nimpatience to have done with the place and hide herself. The pavements\r\nwere already drying; a warm wind was driving away the last clouds.\r\n\r\nTaking the Rue Tronchet, she found herself at the flower-market of the\r\nMadeleine, one of those March markets, all abloom with primroses and\r\nazaleas, in the dull days of expiring winter. She sauntered for half\r\nan hour, amidst this premature spring, resuming her vague reflections,\r\nthinking of Jacques as an enemy whom she must disarm. It seemed to\r\nher that she had paid her visit to the Rue du Rocher, that all had\r\ngone well in that quarter, that the only thing remaining was to ensure\r\nthe silence of this man; and this was a complicated undertaking that\r\nbewildered her, and set her head labouring at romantic plans. But these\r\ncaused her no worry, no terror; on the contrary she experienced a\r\nsweet, soothing feeling. Then, abruptly, she saw the time by a clock\r\nat a kiosk: ten minutes past one. She had not yet performed her errand;\r\nand, harshly recalled to the agony of reality, she hastened in the\r\ndirection of the Rue du Rocher.\r\n\r\nThe residence of M. Camy-Lamotte was at the corner of this street and\r\nthe Rue de Naples, and S\xc3\xa9verine had to pass by the house of Grandmorin,\r\nwhich stood silent, tenantless, and with closed shutters. Raising her\r\neyes, she hurried on. She recollected her last visit. The great house\r\ntowered up, terrible, before her, and when a little further on, she\r\ninstinctively turned round, to look behind, like a person pursued by\r\nthe shouts of a crowd, she was startled to perceive M. Denizet, the\r\nexamining-magistrate at Rouen, who was also coming up the street, on\r\nthe opposite side of the way. The thrill she experienced brought her\r\nto a standstill. Had he noticed her casting a glance at the house? He\r\nwas walking along quietly, and she allowed him to get ahead of her,\r\nfollowing him in great trouble. She received another shock when she saw\r\nhim ring at the corner of the Rue de Naples, at the residence of M.\r\nCamy-Lamotte.\r\n\r\nShe felt terrified. She would never dare enter now. She turned on her\r\nheel, cut through the Rue d\'Edimbourg, and descended as far as the\r\nPont de l\'Europe. It was not until then, that she felt herself secure.\r\nAnd, quite distracted, not knowing where to go nor what to do, she\r\nleant motionless against one of the balustrades, gazing below, across\r\nthe iron sheds, at the vast station, where the trains were constantly\r\nperforming evolutions. She followed them with her anxious eyes. She\r\nthought the magistrate must assuredly have gone to see M. Camy-Lamotte\r\non this business, that the two men were talking about her, and that her\r\nfate was being settled at that very minute.\r\n\r\nThen, in despair, she was tormented by the desire to cast herself at\r\nonce under a train rather than return to the Rue du Rocher. Just then\r\na train was issuing from beneath the iron marquee of the main lines.\r\nShe watched it coming and pass below her, puffing in her face a tepid\r\ncloud of white steam. Then the stupid uselessness of her journey, the\r\nfrightful anguish she would carry away with her, should she fail to\r\nhave the energy to go and find out something certain, were impressed on\r\nher mind with such vigour, that she gave herself five minutes to gain\r\ncourage.\r\n\r\nEngines were whistling. Her eyes followed a small one, branching\r\noff a train that served the environs; and, then looking up towards\r\nthe left, she recognised above the courtyard of the small parcels\r\ndepartment, at the very top of the house in the Impasse d\'Amsterdam,\r\nthe window of Mother Victoire--that window on whose rail she again saw\r\nherself leaning with her husband, before the abominable scene that\r\nhad caused their calamity. This brought home to her the danger of her\r\nposition with such a keen pang of pain, that she suddenly felt ready\r\nto encounter anything, to put an end to the business. The blasts of\r\nthe horn, and the prolonged rumbling noise deafened her, while thick\r\nsmoke flying over the great, clear, Parisian sky, barred the horizon.\r\nAnd she again took the road to the Rue du Rocher, wending her way with\r\nthe feelings of a person going to commit suicide, stepping out with\r\nprecipitation, in sudden fear lest she might find no one there.\r\n\r\nWhen S\xc3\xa9verine had touched the bell a renewed feeling of terror turned\r\nher icy cold. But a footman, after taking her name, had already offered\r\nher a seat in an antechamber; and through the doors, gently set ajar,\r\nshe very distinctly heard the lively conversation of two voices. Then\r\nfollowed profound and absolute silence. She could distinguish naught\r\nbut the dull throbbing of her temples. And she said to herself that the\r\nmagistrate must still be in conference, and that she would no doubt be\r\nkept waiting a long time; and this idea of waiting seemed intolerable.\r\nAll at once, she met with a surprise; the footman came to her, and\r\nshowed her in. The magistrate had certainly not gone. She conjectured\r\nhe was there, hidden behind a door.\r\n\r\nShe found herself in a large study, with black furniture, a thick\r\ncarpet, and heavy door-hangings, so severe and so completely closed,\r\nthat not a sound from the outside could penetrate within. Nevertheless,\r\nthere were some flowers, some pale roses in a bronze corbeil, and\r\nthis indicated a sort of concealed grace, a taste for amiable life\r\nbeneath all this severity. The master of the house was on his feet,\r\nvery correctly attired in a frock-coat; he also looked severe with his\r\npinched face, which his greyish whiskers rendered slightly fuller. But\r\nhe had all the elegance of a former beau who had remained slim, and a\r\ndemeanour that one felt would be pleasant, freed from the stiffness\r\nthat his official position made him assume. In the subdued light of the\r\napartment, he looked very tall.\r\n\r\nS\xc3\xa9verine, on entering, felt oppressed by the close atmosphere caused\r\nby the hangings, and she saw no one but M. Camy-Lamotte, who watched\r\nher approach. He made no motion to invite her to be seated, and he was\r\ncareful not to open his mouth the first, waiting for her to explain the\r\nmotive of her visit. This prolonged the silence. But, as the result of\r\na violent reaction, she all at once found she was mistress of herself\r\nin the peril, and remained very calm, and very prudent.\r\n\r\n"Sir," said she, "you will excuse me if I make so bold as to come\r\nand solicit your goodwill. You are aware of the irreparable loss I\r\nhave suffered, and, abandoned as I now am, I have had the courage to\r\nthink of you to defend us, to continue to give us a little of the same\r\nsupport as your friend, my deeply regretted protector."\r\n\r\nM. Camy-Lamotte was then obliged to wave his hand to a seat, for she\r\nhad spoken in a strain that was perfect, without exaggerated humility\r\nor grief, with the innate art of feminine hypocrisy; but he still\r\nmaintained silence. He had himself sat down, still waiting. Seeing she\r\nmust explain, she continued:\r\n\r\n"Allow me to refresh your memory by reminding you that I have had the\r\nhonour of seeing you at Doinville. Ah! those were happy days for me! At\r\npresent, bad times have come, and I have no one but you, sir. I implore\r\nyou, in the name of him we have lost, you who were his intimate friend,\r\nto complete his good work, to take his place beside us."\r\n\r\nHe listened, he looked at her, and all his suspicions were wavering;\r\nshe seemed so natural, so charming in her expressions of regret and\r\nsupplication. It had struck him that the letter he had found among\r\nthe papers of Grandmorin, those two unsigned lines, could only have\r\ncome from her, whom he knew to be intimate with the President, and\r\njust now the mere mention of her visit had completely convinced him.\r\nHe had only interrupted his interview with the magistrate, to confirm\r\nhis conviction. But how could he think her guilty seeing her as she\r\nappeared--so quiet and so sweet?\r\n\r\nHe wished to set his mind at rest. And while maintaining an air of\r\nseverity, he said:\r\n\r\n"Tell me what it is all about, madam. I remember perfectly. I shall\r\nonly be too happy to be of use to you, if there is no impediment."\r\n\r\nS\xc3\xa9verine then related, very plainly, that her husband was threatened\r\nwith dismissal. They were very jealous of him on account of his merit,\r\nand of the high patronage which hitherto had covered him. Now, thinking\r\nhim without support, they hoped to triumph, and redoubled their\r\nefforts. Nevertheless, she mentioned no names. She spoke in measured\r\nterms in spite of the imminent peril. For her to have decided on making\r\nthe journey to Paris, she must have been convinced of the necessity\r\nof acting as rapidly as possible. Perhaps to-morrow it would be no\r\nlonger time; it was immediately that she required help and succour.\r\nShe related all this with such an abundance of logical facts, and good\r\nreasons, that it seemed to him really impossible that she should have\r\ntaken the trouble to come up with any other object.\r\n\r\nM. Camy-Lamotte studied her even to the slight, almost imperceptible\r\nquiver of her lips, and he struck the first blow.\r\n\r\n"But why should the company dismiss your husband? They have nothing\r\ngrave to reproach him with," said he.\r\n\r\nNeither did her eyes leave him. She sat watching the faintest lines on\r\nhis face, wondering if he had found the letter; and, notwithstanding\r\nthe apparent innocence of the question, she abruptly became convinced\r\nthat the letter was there, in one of the pieces of furniture in that\r\nstudy. He knew all about it, for he had set a trap for her, anxious\r\nto learn whether she would dare mention the real reasons for his\r\ndismissal. Moreover, he had too forcibly accentuated his tone, and she\r\nfelt herself probed to the innermost recesses of her being, by his\r\nsparkless eyes of a worn-out man.\r\n\r\nBravely she advanced to the peril.\r\n\r\n"Dear me, sir!" she said; "it sounds very monstrous, but they suspected\r\nus of killing our benefactor, on account of that unfortunate will. We\r\nhad no difficulty in proving our innocence, only there always remains\r\nsomething of these abominable accusations, and the company no doubt\r\nfears the scandal."\r\n\r\nHe was again surprised, thrown off his guard, by this frankness,\r\nparticularly by the sincerity of her accent. Besides, having at first\r\nglance considered her face merely passable, he began to find her\r\nextremely seductive, with the complacent submissiveness of her blue\r\neyes, set off by the energy of her raven hair. She was really very\r\ncharming, very refined, and he allowed the smile of an amateur of\r\nfeminine charms, no longer interested in such matters, to mingle with\r\nthe grand, cold manner of the functionary who had such a disagreeable\r\naffair on his hands.\r\n\r\nBut S\xc3\xa9verine, with the bravado of the woman who feels her strength, had\r\nthe imprudence to add:\r\n\r\n"Persons like ourselves do not kill for money. There would have been\r\nsome other motive, and there was none."\r\n\r\nHe looked at her, and saw the corners of her mouth quiver. It was\r\nshe. Thenceforth his conviction was absolute. And she understood,\r\nimmediately, that she had given herself up, at the way in which he\r\nhad ceased to smile, and at his nervously pinched chin. She felt\r\nlike fainting, as if all her being was abandoning her. Nevertheless,\r\nshe remained on her chair, her bust straight. She heard her voice\r\ncontinuing to converse in the same even tone, uttering the words it was\r\nnecessary to say. The conversation pursued its course; but, henceforth,\r\nneither had anything further to learn. He had the letter. It was she\r\nwho had written it.\r\n\r\n"Madam," he at last resumed, "I do not refuse to intercede with the\r\ncompany, if you are really worthy of interest. It so happens that I am\r\nexpecting the traffic-manager this afternoon, on some other business.\r\nOnly, I shall require a few notes. Look here, just write me down the\r\nname, the age, the record of service, of your husband; briefly, all\r\nthat is necessary to post me up in regard to your position."\r\n\r\nAnd he pushed a small occasional-table towards her, ceasing to look at\r\nher, so as not to frighten her too much. She shuddered. He wanted a\r\npage of her handwriting, in order to compare it with the letter. For a\r\nmoment she despairingly sought a pretext, resolved not to write. Then\r\nshe reflected: what was the good of that, as he knew? It would be easy\r\nto obtain a few lines she had penned. Without any visible discomposure,\r\nin the simplest manner in the world, she wrote down what he asked\r\nher for; while he, standing up behind her, recognised the writing\r\nperfectly, although taller and less shaky than that in the note. And\r\nhe ended by thinking this slim little woman very brave. He smiled\r\nagain, now she was unable to see him, with that smile of the man who\r\nis no longer touched by anything, save the charm, and whom experience\r\nin everything has made insouciant. After all, it was not worth the\r\ntrouble to be just. He only watched over the decorative part of the\r\nr\xc3\xa9gime he served.\r\n\r\n"Very well, madam," said he, "give me this. I will make inquiries; I\r\nwill do the best I can."\r\n\r\n"I am very much obliged to you, sir," she answered. "So you will see\r\nthat my husband is maintained in his position? I may consider the\r\naffair arranged?"\r\n\r\n"Ah! no, indeed!" he exclaimed; "I bind myself to nothing. I shall have\r\nto see, to think the matter over."\r\n\r\nIn fact he was hesitating. He did not know what course he would follow\r\nin regard to the couple. And she was in anguish, since she felt herself\r\nat his mercy: this hesitation, this alternative of being saved or\r\nruined by him, without being able to guess the reasons that would\r\ninfluence him in his decision, drove her crazy.\r\n\r\n"Oh! sir! think how tormented we are! You will not let me leave without\r\na certainty," she pleaded.\r\n\r\n"Indeed, madam, I can do nothing. You must wait," said he.\r\n\r\nHe led her to the door. She was going away in despair, beside herself,\r\non the point of confessing everything, openly, feeling the immediate\r\nnecessity of forcing him to say distinctly what he intended doing with\r\nthem. To remain a minute longer, hoping to find a subterfuge, she\r\nexclaimed:\r\n\r\n"Ah! I forgot! I wished to ask your advice about that wretched will. Do\r\nyou think we ought to refuse the legacy?"\r\n\r\n"The law is on your side," he prudently answered. "It is a matter of\r\nappreciation, and of circumstances."\r\n\r\nShe was on the threshold of the door, and she made a final effort.\r\n\r\n"Sir," said she, "do not allow me to leave thus! Tell me if I may hope."\r\n\r\nWith a gesture of abandonment, she had seized his hand. He drew it\r\naway. But she looked at him with her beautiful eyes so ardent with\r\nprayer, that he was stirred.\r\n\r\n"Very well, then, return here at five o\'clock. Perhaps I may have\r\nsomething to tell you."\r\n\r\nShe went off. She quitted the house in still greater agony than on\r\nentering it. The situation had become clear, her fate remained in\r\nsuspense. She was threatened with arrest which might take place at\r\nonce. How could she keep alive until five o\'clock? Suddenly she thought\r\nof Jacques, whom she had forgotten. He was another who might be her\r\nruin, if they took her in charge! Although it was barely half-past two,\r\nshe hastened to ascend the Rue du Rocher, in the direction of the Rue\r\nCardinet.\r\n\r\nM. Camy-Lamotte, left alone, stood before his writing-table. A familiar\r\nfigure at the Tuileries, where his functions as chief secretary to\r\nthe Ministry of Justice, caused him to be summoned almost daily, as\r\npowerful as the Minister himself, and even entrusted with more delicate\r\nduties, he was aware how irritating and alarming this Grandmorin\r\ncase proved in high quarters. The opposition newspapers continued to\r\ncarry on a noisy campaign; some accusing the police of being so busy\r\nwith political business, that they had no time to arrest murderers;\r\nthe others, probing the life of the President, gave their readers to\r\nunderstand that he belonged to the Court, where the lowest kind of\r\ndebauchery prevailed; and this campaign really became disastrous, as\r\nthe time for the elections approached. And so it had been formally\r\nintimated to the chief secretary, that he must bring the business to a\r\ntermination as rapidly as possible, no matter how. The Minister, having\r\nrelieved himself of this delicate affair by passing it on to him, he\r\nfound himself sole arbiter of the decision to be taken, but on his own\r\nresponsibility, it is true; a matter that required looking into, for he\r\nhad no idea of paying for the others, should he prove inexpert.\r\n\r\nM. Camy-Lamotte, still thinking, went and opened the door of the\r\nadjoining room where M. Denizet was waiting. And the latter, who had\r\noverheard everything, exclaimed on entering:\r\n\r\n"What did I say? It is wrong to suspect those people. This woman is\r\nevidently only thinking of saving her husband from possible dismissal.\r\nShe did not utter a single word that could arouse suspicion."\r\n\r\nThe chief secretary did not answer at once. All absorbed, his eyes\r\non the magistrate, struck by his heavy, thin-lipped face, he was now\r\nthinking of that magistracy, which he held in his hand, as occult chief\r\nof its members, and he felt astonished that it was still so worthy\r\nin its poverty, so intelligent in its professional torpidity. But\r\nreally, this gentleman, however sharp he might fancy himself, with his\r\neyes veiled with thick lids, was tenacious in his conviction, when he\r\nthought he had got hold of the truth.\r\n\r\n"So," resumed M. Camy-Lamotte, "you persist in believing in the guilt\r\nof this Cabuche?"\r\n\r\nM. Denizet started in astonishment.\r\n\r\n"Oh! certainly!" said he; "everything is against him! I enumerated\r\nthe proofs to you. I may say they are classic, for not one is\r\nwanting. I did not fail to look for an accomplice, a woman in the\r\ncoup\xc3\xa9, as you suggested. This seemed to agree with the evidence of a\r\ndriver, a man who caught a glimpse of the murder scene. But skilfully\r\ncross-questioned by me, this man did not persist in his first\r\nstatement, and he even recognised the travelling-rug, as being the dark\r\nbundle he had referred to. Oh! yes; Cabuche is certainly the culprit,\r\nand the more so, as, if we cannot fix it on him, we have no one else."\r\n\r\nUp to then, the chief secretary had delayed bringing the written proof\r\nhe possessed to the knowledge of the magistrate; and now that he had\r\nformed a conviction, he was still less eager to establish the truth.\r\nWhat was the use of upsetting the false clue of the prosecution, if the\r\nreal clue was to lead to greater embarrassments? All this would have\r\nto be considered in the first instance.\r\n\r\n"Very well," he resumed, with that smile of the worn-out man, "I am\r\nwilling to admit you are right. I only sent for you for the purpose of\r\ndiscussing certain grave points. This is an exceptional case, and it\r\nhas now become quite political; you feel this, do you not? We shall\r\ntherefore, perhaps, find ourselves compelled to act as government men.\r\nCome, frankly, this girl, the sweetheart of Cabuche, was victimised,\r\neh?"\r\n\r\nThe magistrate gave the pout of a cunning fellow, whilst his eyes\r\nbecame half lost in his lids.\r\n\r\n"If you ask me," said he, "I think the President put her in a great\r\nfright, and this will assuredly come out at the trial. Moreover, if\r\nthe defence is entrusted to a lawyer of the opposition, we may expect\r\na regular avalanche of tiresome tales; for there is no lack of these\r\nstories down there, in our part of the country."\r\n\r\nThis Denizet was not so stupid when free from the routine of the\r\nprofession, where he soared on high in his unlimited perspicacity and\r\nmighty power. He understood why he had been summoned to the private\r\nresidence of the chief secretary, in preference to the Ministry of\r\nJustice.\r\n\r\n"Briefly," concluded he, seeing that M. Camy-Lamotte did not open his\r\nmouth, "we shall have a rather nasty business."\r\n\r\nThe chief secretary confined himself to tossing his head. He was\r\nengaged in calculating the results of the trial of the Roubauds. It was\r\na dead certainty that if the husband were brought up at the assizes, he\r\nwould relate all: how his wife had been led astray, she also, when a\r\nyoung girl, and the intrigues that followed, and the jealous rage that\r\nhad urged him on to murder, without taking into consideration that,\r\nin this instance, it was not a question of a domestic and a convicted\r\ncriminal. This assistant station-master, married to this pretty woman,\r\nwould mix up a number of people of independent means, and others\r\nconnected with the railways, in the business. Then, who could tell\r\nwhere the affairs of a man like the President would lead them? They\r\nmight perhaps fall into unforeseen abominations. No, decidedly; the\r\ncase against the Roubauds, the real culprits, was more objectionable\r\nthan the other. He had made up his mind; he put it absolutely aside. If\r\nthey had to choose between the two, he was in favour of proceeding with\r\nthe prosecution of the innocent Cabuche.\r\n\r\n"I give in to your theory," he at last said to M. Denizet. "There are,\r\nindeed, strong presumptions against the quarryman, if so be he had a\r\nlegitimate vengeance to satisfy; but all this is very sad, and what a\r\nquantity of mud will be thrown about! Of course I know that justice\r\nshould remain indifferent to consequences, and that, soaring above the\r\ninterests----"\r\n\r\nHe concluded his phrase with a gesture, while the magistrate, silent in\r\nturn, awaited with gloomy countenance, the orders he felt were coming.\r\nFrom the moment they accepted his idea of the truth--that creation of\r\nhis own intelligence, he was ready to sacrifice the idea of justice to\r\nthe requirements of the government. But the secretary, notwithstanding\r\nhis usual dexterity in this kind of transaction, hastened on a little,\r\nspoke too rapidly, like a chief in the habit of being obeyed.\r\n\r\n"Finally, what is desired is that you should desist from further\r\nproceedings," said he. "Arrange matters so that the case may be\r\nshelved."\r\n\r\n"Excuse me, sir," answered M. Denizet, "I am no longer master of the\r\ncase; it rests with my conscience."\r\n\r\nAt once M. Camy-Lamotte smiled, becoming correct again, with an easy\r\nand polite bearing that seemed full of mockery.\r\n\r\n"No doubt; and it is to your conscience that I appeal. I leave you to\r\ntake the decision it may dictate, convinced that you will equitably\r\nweigh both sides, in view of the triumph of healthy doctrines, and\r\npublic morality. You know, better than I can tell you, that it is\r\nsometimes heroic to accept one evil, rather than fall into another\r\nthat is worse. Briefly, one only appeals to you as a good citizen, an\r\nupright man. No one thinks of interfering with your independence, and\r\nthat is why I repeat that you are absolute master in the matter, as,\r\nfor that matter, it has been provided by law."\r\n\r\nJealous of this illimited power, particularly when prepared to make a\r\nbad use of it, the magistrate welcomed each of these sentences with a\r\nnod of satisfaction.\r\n\r\n"Besides," continued the other, redoubling his good grace, with an\r\nexaggeration that was becoming sarcastic, "we know whom we address. We\r\nhave long been watching your efforts; and I may tell you that we should\r\ncall you without delay to Paris, were there a vacancy."\r\n\r\nM. Denizet made a movement. What was this? If he rendered the service\r\nrequired of him, they would not satisfy his great ambition, his dream\r\nof a seat at Paris. But M. Camy-Lamotte, who understood, lost no time\r\nin adding:\r\n\r\n"Your place is marked. It is a question of time. Only, as I have\r\ncommenced to be indiscreet, I am happy to be able to tell you that your\r\nname is down for the cross, on the Emperor\'s next f\xc3\xaate-day."\r\n\r\nThe magistrate reflected a moment. He would have preferred advancement,\r\nfor he reckoned that it carried with it an increase of about 166\r\nfrcs., or \xc2\xa36 16_s._, a month in salary. And, in the decent misery in\r\nwhich he lived, this meant greater comfort, his wardrobe renewed, his\r\nservant M\xc3\xa9lanie better fed, and in consequence better tempered; but\r\nthe cross, nevertheless, was worth having. Then, he had a promise.\r\nAnd he, who would not have sold himself, nurtured in the tradition of\r\nthis magistracy, upright and mediocre, he at once yielded to a simple\r\nhope, to the vague promise that the administration made to favour him.\r\nThe judicial function was nothing more than a trade like others, and\r\nhe bore along the burden of advancement, in the quality of a humble\r\nsolicitant, ever ready to bend to the orders of authority.\r\n\r\n"I feel very much touched at the honour," he murmured. "Kindly say so\r\nto the Minister."\r\n\r\nHe had risen, feeling that anything they might add, would cause\r\nuneasiness.\r\n\r\n"So," he concluded, his eyes dim, his face expressionless, "I shall\r\ncomplete my inquiry, bearing your scruples in mind. Of course, if we\r\nhave not absolute proof against this Cabuche, it would be better not\r\nto risk the useless scandal of a trial. He shall be set at liberty and\r\nwatched."\r\n\r\nThe chief secretary, on the threshold of his study, made a final\r\ndisplay of effusive amiability.\r\n\r\n"Monsieur Denizet," said he, "we entirely rely on your great tact and\r\nhigh rectitude."\r\n\r\nM. Camy-Lamotte, alone again, had the curiosity which, however,\r\nwas useless, now, to compare the page penned by S\xc3\xa9verine with the\r\nunsigned note he had found among the papers of President Grandmorin.\r\nThe resemblance proved complete. He folded up the letter and put it\r\ncarefully away, for, if he had not breathed a word about it to the\r\nexamining-magistrate, he nevertheless considered such an arm worth\r\nkeeping. And as he recalled the profile of this little woman, so\r\ndelicate, and yet so strong in her nervous resistance, he gave an\r\nindulgent, mocking shrug of the shoulders. Ah! those creatures, when\r\nthey mean it!\r\n\r\nWhen S\xc3\xa9verine reached the Rue Cardinet at twenty minutes to three, to\r\nkeep her appointment with Jacques, she found herself before her time.\r\nHe occupied a small room right at the top of a great house, to which he\r\nonly ascended at night for the purpose of sleeping. And he slept out\r\ntwice a week, on the two nights he passed at Havre, between the evening\r\nand morning express. On that particular day, however, drenched with\r\nrain, broken down with fatigue, he had gone there and thrown himself on\r\nhis bed. So that S\xc3\xa9verine would perhaps have waited for him in vain,\r\nhad not a quarrel in an adjoining apartment, a husband brutalising his\r\nshrieking wife, awakened him. He had washed and dressed in a very bad\r\nhumour, having recognised her below, on the pavement, while looking out\r\nof his garret window.\r\n\r\n"So it\'s you at last!" she exclaimed, when she saw him issue from the\r\nfront door. "I was afraid I had misunderstood. You really did tell me\r\nat the corner of the Rue Saussure----"\r\n\r\nAnd without awaiting his answer, raising her eyes to the house, she\r\nremarked:\r\n\r\n"So it\'s there you live?"\r\n\r\nWithout telling her, he had made the appointment before his own door,\r\nbecause the dep\xc3\xb4t where they had to go together, was opposite. But her\r\nquestion worried him. He imagined she was going to take advantage of\r\ntheir good fellowship, to ask him to let her see his room, which was so\r\nsimply furnished, and in such disorder, that he felt ashamed of it.\r\n\r\n"Oh! I don\'t live there!" he replied; "I perch. Let us be quick, I am\r\nafraid the chief may have already gone out!"\r\n\r\nAnd so it happened, for when they presented themselves at the small\r\nhouse which the latter occupied behind the dep\xc3\xb4t, within the station\r\nwalls, they did not find him. In vain they went from shed to shed,\r\neverywhere they were told to return at about half-past four, if they\r\nwished to be sure of catching him at the repairing workshops.\r\n\r\n"Very well, we will return," said S\xc3\xa9verine.\r\n\r\nThen, when she was again outside, alone in the company of Jacques, she\r\nremarked:\r\n\r\n"If you are free, perhaps you will not mind if I remain and wait with\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\nHe could not refuse; and, moreover, notwithstanding the gloomy anxiety\r\nshe caused, she exercised such a great and ever-increasing charm over\r\nhim, that the sullen attitude he had made up his mind to observe,\r\nvanished at her sweet glances. This one, with her long, tender, timid\r\nface, must love like a faithful hound, whom one would not even have the\r\ncourage to thrash.\r\n\r\n"Of course I shall not leave you," he answered, in a less surly tone;\r\n"only we have more than an hour to get through. Would you like to go to\r\na caf\xc3\xa9?"\r\n\r\nShe smiled, delighted to find him more cordial. Vivaciously she\r\nprotested:\r\n\r\n"Oh! no, no; I don\'t want to shut myself up! I prefer walking on your\r\narm through the streets, anywhere you like."\r\n\r\nAnd gracefully she took his arm of her own accord. Now that he was free\r\nfrom the dirt of the journey, she thought him superior-looking, in\r\nhis attire of a clerk in easy circumstances, and with his gentlemanly\r\nbearing, enhanced by a look of independent pride, due to his life\r\nin the open air and the daily habit of facing danger. She had never\r\nnoticed so distinctly that he was handsome, with his regular, round\r\ncountenance, and his black moustache on a white skin. His fleeting\r\neyes, those eyes studded with golden sparks, which turned away from\r\nher, alone continued to cause her distrust. If he avoided looking her\r\nstraight in the face, was it because he would not bind himself to\r\nanything, because he wished to retain his freedom to act as he pleased,\r\neven against her?\r\n\r\nFrom that moment, in her uncertainty as to his intentions, shuddering\r\neach time she thought of that study in the Rue du Rocher where her\r\nlife lay in the balance, she had but one aim--to feel that this man,\r\nwho gave her his arm, belonged to her entirely; to obtain, that when\r\nshe raised her head, his eyes should look deeply into her own. Then he\r\nwould be her property. She did not love him; she did not even think\r\nof such a thing. She was simply doing her utmost to make him her\r\ncreature, so that she need fear him no more.\r\n\r\nThey walked for a few minutes without speaking, amid the continual\r\nstream of passers-by who obstruct this populous quarter. Ever and anon\r\nthey were compelled to leave the pavement; they crossed the road among\r\nthe vehicles. Then they found themselves at the Square des Batignolles,\r\nwhich is almost deserted at this time of year. The sky, cleansed by\r\nthe deluge of the morning, wore a tint of very soft blue, and the\r\nlilac-bushes were budding in the gentle March sun.\r\n\r\n"Shall we go into the garden?" inquired S\xc3\xa9verine. "All this crowd makes\r\nme giddy."\r\n\r\nJacques had intended entering the enclosure of his own accord,\r\nunconscious of his desire to have her more to himself, far from the\r\nmultitude of people.\r\n\r\n"As you like," said he. "Let us go in."\r\n\r\nSlowly they continued walking beside the grass, between the leafless\r\ntrees. A few women were out with babies in long clothes, and persons\r\nwere hurrying across the garden to make a short cut. Jacques and\r\nS\xc3\xa9verine took the brook at a stride, and ascended among the rocks.\r\nThen, retracing their steps, not knowing where to go, they passed\r\nthrough a cluster of pines, whose lasting dark green foliage shone in\r\nthe sun. And there, in this solitary corner, stood a bench hidden from\r\nview. They sat down, without even consulting one another this time, as\r\nif they had agreed to come to that spot.\r\n\r\n"It is lovely weather," she remarked after a silence.\r\n\r\n"Yes," he replied; "the sun has made its appearance again."\r\n\r\nBut their thoughts were elsewhere. He, who fled women, had been\r\nreflecting on the events that had drawn him to this one. She sat there,\r\ntouching him, threatening to invade his existence, and he experienced\r\nendless surprise. Since the last examination at Rouen, he no longer\r\nhad any doubt. This woman was an accomplice in the murder at La\r\nCroix-de-Maufras. How was it? As the result of what circumstances?\r\nUrged to the crime by what passion, or what interest? He had asked\r\nhimself these questions, without being able to answer them clearly.\r\nNevertheless, he had ended by arranging a version: the husband,\r\navaricious and violent, yearned to get possession of the legacy;\r\nperhaps he feared the will might be altered to their disadvantage;\r\nperhaps he wished to attach his wife to him by a sanguinary bond.\r\nAnd he clung to this version. The obscure parts of it interested him\r\nwithout him seeking to elucidate them.\r\n\r\nThe idea that it was his duty to unbosom himself to justice, had also\r\nhaunted him. It was this idea, indeed, that had been engaging his\r\nattention since he had found himself seated on that bench close to\r\nS\xc3\xa9verine, so close that he could feel the warmth of her form against\r\nhis own.\r\n\r\n"It\'s astonishing," he resumed, "to be able to remain out of doors like\r\nthis, in the month of March, just as in summer."\r\n\r\n"Oh!" said she, "as soon as the sun ascends, it is delightful!"\r\n\r\nAnd, on her side, she reflected that this man would have been an idiot,\r\nhad he not guessed them the culprits. They had been too eager to force\r\nthemselves on him, and at this very moment she continued to press too\r\nclose to him. And so, in the silence broken by empty phrases, she\r\nfollowed his reflections.\r\n\r\nTheir eyes had met. She had just read in his, that he had come to the\r\npoint of inquiring of himself whether it was not she whom he had seen,\r\nweighing with all her weight on the legs of the victim, like a dark\r\nbundle. What could she do? what could she say, to bind him to her by an\r\ninseverable bond?\r\n\r\n"This morning," she remarked, "it was very cold at Havre."\r\n\r\n"Without taking into account," said he, "all the rain that fell."\r\n\r\nAt that instant, S\xc3\xa9verine had an abrupt inspiration. She did not\r\nreason, she did not think the matter over; it came to her like an\r\ninstinctive impulsion from the obscure depths of her intelligence and\r\nheart. Had she thought about it, she would have said nothing. She\r\nsimply felt the idea was good, and that by speaking she would conquer\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nGently she took his hand. She looked at him. The cluster of green trees\r\nhid them from the pedestrians in the neighbouring streets. They only\r\nheard a distant rumble of vehicles that came deadened to this sunny\r\nsolitude of the square. Alone, at the bend of the path, a child played\r\nin silence, filling a small pail with sand with a wooden spade. Without\r\nwavering in her idea, with all her soul, and in a low voice she put\r\nthis question to him:\r\n\r\n"You believe me guilty?"\r\n\r\nHe slightly trembled, and looked into her eyes.\r\n\r\n"Yes," he answered, in the same low, unsteady tone.\r\n\r\nThen she pressed his hand, which she had retained, in a tighter clasp.\r\nBut she did not continue speaking at once. She felt their feverish\r\nwarmth mingling in one.\r\n\r\n"You are mistaken," she resumed; "I am not guilty."\r\n\r\nShe did not say this to convince him, but simply to warn him that she\r\nmust be innocent in the eyes of others. It was the avowal of the woman\r\nwho says no, desiring it to be no, in spite of all, and always.\r\n\r\n"I am not guilty," she added. "You will not continue to pain me by\r\nbelieving I am guilty?"\r\n\r\nAnd she was very happy to see his eyes gazing deeply into her own.\r\nWithout doubt what she had just said, was equivalent to selling herself\r\nto him, for she gave herself away, and later on, if he claimed her, she\r\ncould not refuse. But the bond was tied between them, and could not be\r\nsevered. She absolutely defied him to speak now. He belonged to her, as\r\nshe belonged to him. The avowal had united them.\r\n\r\n"You will not cause me any more pain?" she asked. "You believe me?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I believe you," he replied, smiling.\r\n\r\nWhat need was there to force her to talk brutally of this frightful\r\nevent? Later on, she would tell him all about it, if she wished to do\r\nso. This way of tranquillising herself by confessing to him, without\r\nsaying anything, touched him deeply, as a proof of infinite tenderness.\r\nShe was so confiding, so fragile, with her gentle blue eyes. She\r\nappeared to him so womanly, devoted to man, ever ready to submit to him\r\nso as to be happy. And what delighted him above all else, while their\r\nhands remained joined and their eyes never parted, was to find himself\r\nfree from his disorder, the frightful shiver that agitated him when\r\nbeside a woman. Could he love this one, without killing her?\r\n\r\n"You know I am your friend, and that you have naught to fear from me,"\r\nhe murmured in her ear. "I do not want to know your business. It shall\r\nbe as you please, you understand. Make any use of me you like."\r\n\r\nHe had approached so close to her face that he felt her warm breath in\r\nhis moustache. That morning, even, he would have trembled at such a\r\nthing, in the wild terror of an attack. What could be passing within\r\nhim, that he barely felt a thrill, attended by the pleasant lassitude\r\nof convalescence? This idea that she had killed a fellow creature,\r\nwhich had now become a certainty, made her appear different in his\r\neyes--greater, a person apart. Perhaps she had not merely assisted, but\r\nhad also struck. He felt convinced of it, without the slightest proof.\r\nAnd, henceforth, she seemed sacred to him, beyond all reasoning.\r\n\r\nBoth of them now chatted gaily, as a couple just met, with whom love is\r\ncommencing.\r\n\r\n"You should give me your other hand," said he, "for me to warm it."\r\n\r\n"Oh! no, not here," she protested. "We might be seen."\r\n\r\n"Who by, as we are alone?" he inquired. "And, besides, there would be\r\nno harm in it," he added.\r\n\r\nShe laughed frankly in her joy at being saved. She did not love this\r\nman, she thought she was quite sure of that; and, indeed, if she\r\nhad involved herself, she was already thinking of a way out of the\r\ndifficulty. He looked nice; he would not torment her; everything could\r\nbe arranged beautifully.\r\n\r\n"We are comrades, that\'s settled," said she; "and neither my husband\r\nnor anyone else shall interfere. Now, let go of my hand, and do not\r\nkeep on staring at me like that, because you will spoil your eyes!"\r\n\r\nBut he detained her delicate fingers between his own, and very lowly he\r\nstammered:\r\n\r\n"You know I love you."\r\n\r\nSharply she freed herself with a slight jerk; and, standing before the\r\nbench, where he remained seated, she exclaimed:\r\n\r\n"What nonsense, indeed! Conduct yourself properly; someone is coming!"\r\n\r\nA wet-nurse appeared, with her baby asleep in her arms. Then a young\r\ngirl passed along in a great hurry. The sun was sinking, disappearing\r\non the horizon in a violescent mist, and its rays vanished from the\r\ngrass, dying away in golden dust beside the green patch of pines. A\r\nsudden pause came in the continual rumble of vehicles. Five o\'clock was\r\nheard striking at a neighbouring clock.\r\n\r\n"Good heavens!" exclaimed S\xc3\xa9verine. "Five o\'clock, and I have an\r\nappointment in the Rue du Rocher!"\r\n\r\nHer joy departed, back came the agony of the unknown awaiting her\r\nthere, and she remembered she was not yet saved. She turned quite pale,\r\nand her lip quivered.\r\n\r\n"But you have to see the chief of the dep\xc3\xb4t," said Jacques.\r\n\r\n"It cannot be helped!" she replied; "I must pay him a visit another\r\ntime. Listen, my friend, I will not keep you any longer. Let me go\r\nquickly on my errand. And thanks again, thanks from the bottom of my\r\nheart."\r\n\r\nShe squeezed his hand, and hurried off.\r\n\r\n"By-and-bye at the train," he called after her.\r\n\r\n"Yes, by-and-bye," she answered.\r\n\r\nShe was already walking rapidly away, and soon disappeared among the\r\nclusters of shrubs; whilst he proceeded leisurely, in the direction of\r\nthe Rue Cardinet.\r\n\r\nM. Camy-Lamotte had just had a long interview in his study, with the\r\ntraffic-manager of the Western Railway Company. Summoned under pretext\r\nof some other business, the latter had ended by admitting that the\r\ncompany felt very much annoyed at this Grandmorin case. First of all,\r\ncame the complaints of the newspapers, in regard to the little security\r\nenjoyed by first-class passengers. Then all the staff were mixed\r\nup in the drama. Several of their servants were suspected, without\r\ncounting this Roubaud, who appeared the most involved, and who might\r\nbe arrested at any moment. The rumours of the irregular mode of life\r\nof the President, who had a seat on the board of directors, seemed to\r\nbespatter the whole board. And it was thus that the presumed crime of\r\nan insignificant assistant station-master, attributed to some shady,\r\nlow, and nauseous intrigue, threatened to disorganise the management of\r\nan important railway enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe shock had even been felt in higher places. It had gained the\r\nMinistry, menaced the State at a moment of political uneasiness. It\r\nwas a critical time, when the slightest effervescence might hasten the\r\ndownfall of the Empire.\r\n\r\nSo when M. Camy-Lamotte heard from his visitor, that the company had\r\nthat morning decided to dismiss Roubaud, he energetically opposed\r\nthe measure. No! no! nothing could be more clumsy! The rumpus in\r\nthe press would increase, should the writers take it into their\r\nheads to set up the assistant station-master as a political victim.\r\nEverything would be rent from top to bottom, and heaven only knew\r\nwhat unpleasant revelations would be made about one and another! The\r\nscandal had lasted too long, and must be put an end to at once. And the\r\ntraffic-manager, convinced, had undertaken to maintain Roubaud in his\r\npost, and not even to remove him from Havre. It would soon be seen that\r\nthere were no disreputable people on their staff. It was all over. The\r\nmatter would be shelved.\r\n\r\nWhen S\xc3\xa9verine, out of breath, her heart beating violently, found\r\nherself once more in the severe study in the Rue du Rocher, before\r\nM. Camy-Lamotte, the latter contemplated her an instant in silence,\r\ninterested at the extraordinary effort she made to appear calm. He\r\ncertainly felt sympathy for this delicate criminal with the soft blue\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n"Well, madam----" he began.\r\n\r\nAnd he paused to enjoy her anxiety a few seconds longer. But her look\r\nwas so profound, he felt her casting herself before him in such a\r\nburning desire to learn her fate that he had pity.\r\n\r\n"Well, madam," he resumed, "I\'ve seen the traffic-manager, and have\r\npersuaded him not to dismiss your husband. The matter is settled."\r\n\r\nThen, in the flood of joy that overwhelmed her, she broke down. Her\r\neyes were full of tears; but she answered nothing. She only smiled.\r\n\r\nHe repeated what he had said, laying stress on the phrase, to convey to\r\nher all its significance:\r\n\r\n"The matter is settled; you can return in tranquillity to Havre!"\r\n\r\nShe heard well enough: he meant to say that they would not be arrested,\r\nthat they were pardoned. It was not merely the position maintained, it\r\nwas the horrible drama forgotten, buried. With an instinctive caressing\r\nmovement, like a pretty, domestic animal that thanks and fawns, she\r\nbent over his hands, kissed them, kept them pressed to her cheeks.\r\nAnd this time, very much troubled himself at the tender charm of her\r\ngratitude, he did not withdraw them.\r\n\r\n"Only," he continued, trying to resume his severity, "do not forget,\r\nand behave properly."\r\n\r\n"Oh! sir!" she exclaimed.\r\n\r\nIn the desire to have them both at his mercy, he alluded to the letter.\r\n\r\n"Remember that the papers remain there, and that at the least fault,\r\nthe matter will be brought up again. Above all, advise your husband not\r\nto meddle in politics. On that point we shall be pitiless. I know he\r\nhas already given cause for complaint; they spoke to me of an annoying\r\nquarrel with the sub-prefect. It seems that he passes for a republican,\r\nwhich is detestable, is it not? Let him behave himself, or we shall\r\nsimply suppress him."\r\n\r\nShe was standing up, anxious now to be outside, to give room to the joy\r\nshe felt stifling her.\r\n\r\n"Sir," she answered, "we shall obey you; we will do as you please; no\r\nmatter when, nor where. You have only to command."\r\n\r\nHe began to smile again, in his weary way, with just a tinge of that\r\ndisdain of a man who has taken a long draught at the cup of all things,\r\nand drained it dry.\r\n\r\nHe opened the door of his study to her. On the landing, she turned\r\nround twice, and with her visage beaming, thanked him again.\r\n\r\nOnce in the Rue du Rocher, S\xc3\xa9verine walked along without giving a\r\nthought to where she was going. All at once, she perceived she was\r\nascending the street to no purpose. Turning round, she descended the\r\nslope, crossed the road with no object, at the risk of being knocked\r\ndown. She felt she wanted to move about, to gesticulate, to shout. She\r\nalready understood why they had been pardoned, and she caught herself\r\nsaying:\r\n\r\n"Of course! They are afraid; there is no fear of them stirring up the\r\nbusiness. I was a great fool to give myself all that torture. It was\r\nevident they would do nothing. Ah! what luck! Saved, saved for good\r\nthis time! But no matter, I mean to frighten my husband, so as to make\r\nhim keep quiet. Saved, saved! What luck!"\r\n\r\nAs she turned into the Rue St. Lazare, she saw by a clock at the shop\r\nof a jeweller, that it wanted twenty minutes to six.\r\n\r\n"By Jove! I\'ll stand myself a good dinner. I have time," said she to\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nOpposite the station she picked out the most luxurious-looking\r\nrestaurant; and, seated alone at a small table, with snow-white\r\ncloth, against the undraped plate-glass window, intensely amused\r\nat the movement in the street, she ordered a nice meal: oysters,\r\nfilets-de-sole, and the wing of a roast fowl. She was well entitled to\r\nmake up for a bad lunch. She ate with a first rate appetite, found the\r\nbread, made of the finest flour--the pain-de-gruau--exquisite; and she\r\nhad some beignets souffl\xc3\xa9s prepared for her, by way of sweets. Then,\r\nwhen she had taken her coffee, she hurried off, for she had only a few\r\nminutes left to catch the express.\r\n\r\nJacques, on leaving her, after paying a visit to his room to put on his\r\nworking-garments, had at once made his way to the dep\xc3\xb4t, where, as a\r\nrule, he never showed himself until half an hour before the departure\r\nof his locomotive. He had got into the habit of relying on Pecqueux\r\nto inspect the engine, notwithstanding that the latter was in drink\r\ntwo days out of three. But on that particular evening, in his tender\r\nemotion, he unconsciously felt a scruple. He wished to make sure, with\r\nhis own eyes, that all the parts of the engine were in thorough working\r\norder; and the more so, as in the morning, on the way from Havre, he\r\nfancied he had noticed an increased expenditure of strength, for less\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nAmong the other locomotives at rest in the vast engine-house, into\r\nwhich daylight penetrated through tall, dusty windows, the one driven\r\nby Jacques was already at the head of a line, and destined to leave\r\nthe first. A fireman belonging to the dep\xc3\xb4t, had just made up the fire,\r\nand red-hot cinders were falling below into the ash-pit.\r\n\r\nIt was one of those express engines with double axle-trees coupled\r\ntogether, of delicate elegance, and gigantic build; with its great,\r\nlight wheels united by steel arms, its broad chest, its elongated and\r\nmighty loins, conceived with all that logic and all that certainty,\r\nwhich make up the sovereign beauty of these metal beings--precision\r\nwith strength. Like the other locomotives of the Western Company, this\r\none bore the name of a railway-station as well as a number, that of\r\nLison, a town in lower Normandy. But Jacques, in affection, had turned\r\nthe word into a woman\'s name, by setting the feminine article before\r\nit--La Lison, as he called it with caressing gentleness.\r\n\r\nAnd, in truth, he fondly loved his engine, which he had driven for\r\nfour years. He had been on others, some docile, some jibbers, some\r\ncourageous, and some lazy. He was well aware that each had its peculiar\r\ncharacter, and that some were not worth much. So that if he was fond\r\nof this one, it was because it possessed rare qualities, being gentle,\r\nobedient, easy to set in motion, and gifted with even and lasting\r\nspeed, thanks to its good vaporisation.\r\n\r\nSome pretended that if this locomotive started off so easily, it was\r\ndue to its excellent tyres, and particularly to the perfect regulation\r\nof its slide-valves; and that if a large quantity of steam could be\r\nproduced with little fuel, it was owing to the quality of the copper in\r\nthe tubes, and to the satisfactory arrangement of the boiler.\r\n\r\nBut he knew there was something else; for other engines, built\r\nidentically in the same way, put together with the same care, displayed\r\nnone of the qualities of this one. There was the soul, so to say, to\r\nbe taken into account, the mystery of the fabrication, that peculiar\r\nsomething which the hazard of the hammer gives to the metal, which the\r\nskill of the fitter conveys to the various pieces--the personality of\r\nthe engine, its life.\r\n\r\nSo he loved La Lison, which started quickly and stopped sharp, like a\r\nvigorous and docile steed; he loved it because, apart from his fixed\r\nwages, it earned him cash, thanks to the gratuities on the consumption\r\nof fuel. Its excellent vaporisation effected, indeed, considerable\r\neconomy in coal. It merited but one reproach, that of requiring too\r\nmuch oil. The cylinders, particularly, devoured unreasonable quantities\r\nof this liquid. They had a constant appetite which nothing could\r\nappease. In vain had he sought to moderate it. The engine lost breath\r\nat once. Its constitution required all this nourishment. Ultimately, he\r\nhad made up his mind to tolerate the gluttonous passion, just as the\r\neyes are closed to a vice in people, who, in other respects, are full\r\nof qualities.\r\n\r\nWhilst the fire roared, and La Lison was gradually getting up steam,\r\nJacques walked round and round the engine, inspecting it in all its\r\nparts, endeavouring to discover why, in the morning, it should have put\r\naway more oil than usual. And he found nothing amiss. The locomotive\r\nwas bright and clean, presenting that delightful appearance which\r\nindicates the good, tender care of the driver. He could be seen wiping,\r\nand furbishing the metal incessantly, particularly at the end of a\r\njourney, in the same manner as smoking steeds are whisked down after a\r\nlong run. He rubbed it vigorously, taking advantage of its being warm,\r\nto remove stains and foam more perfectly.\r\n\r\nHe never played tricks with his locomotive, but kept it at an even\r\npace, avoiding getting late, which would necessitate disagreeable\r\nleaps of speed. And the two had gone on so well together, that not\r\nonce in four years had he lodged a complaint in the register at the\r\ndep\xc3\xb4t, where drivers book their requests for repairs--the bad drivers,\r\ndrunkards or idlers, who are ever at variance with their engines. But\r\ntruly, on this particular evening, he had the consumption of oil\r\nat heart; and there was also another feeling, something vague and\r\nprofound, which he had not hitherto experienced--anxiety, distrust, as\r\nif he could not rely on his engine, and wanted to make sure that it was\r\nnot going to behave badly on the journey.\r\n\r\nPecqueux was not there, and when he at length appeared, with flushed\r\ncountenance, after lunching with a friend, Jacques flew into a rage.\r\nHabitually the two men agreed very well, in that long companionship,\r\nextending from one end of the line to the other, jolted side by side,\r\nsilent, united by the same labour and the same dangers.\r\n\r\nAlthough Jacques was the junior of the other man by more than a decade,\r\nhe showed himself paternal for his fireman, shielding his vices,\r\nallowing him to sleep for an hour when too far gone in drink; and the\r\nlatter repaid him for this kindness with canine devotedness. Apart from\r\nhis drunkenness, he was an excellent workman, thoroughly broken to his\r\ncalling. It must be said, that he also loved La Lison, which sufficed\r\nfor a good understanding between the two. And Pecqueux, taken aback at\r\nbeing so roughly welcomed, looked at Jacques with increased surprise,\r\nwhen he heard him grumbling his doubts about the engine.\r\n\r\n"What is the matter? Why, it goes beautifully!" said the fireman.\r\n\r\n"No, no," answered Jacques; "I am uneasy."\r\n\r\nAnd, notwithstanding each part of the locomotive being in good\r\ncondition, he continued to toss his head. He turned the handles,\r\nassured himself that the safety-valve worked well, got on to the\r\nframe-plate, and attended to the grease-boxes of the cylinders himself;\r\nwhile the fireman wiped the dome, where a few slight traces of rust\r\nremained. Nothing was wrong with the sand-rod. All this should have set\r\nhis mind at ease.\r\n\r\nThe fact was, that La Lison no longer stood alone in his heart. Another\r\ntenderness was growing there for that slim, and very fragile creature,\r\nwhom he continued to see beside him on the bench in the garden of the\r\nsquare. A girl so gentle, so caressing, so weak in character, and who\r\nneeded love and protection. Never, when some involuntary cause had\r\nput him behind time, and he had sent his engine along at a speed of\r\nsixty miles an hour, never had he thought of the danger the passengers\r\nmight be incurring. And, now, the mere idea of taking this woman back\r\nto Havre, this woman whom he almost detested in the morning, whom he\r\nbrought up with annoyance, caused him great anxiety, and made him dread\r\nan accident, in which he imagined her wounded by his fault, and dying\r\nin his arms. The distrusted La Lison would do well to behave properly,\r\nif it wished to maintain the reputation of making good speed.\r\n\r\nIt struck six. Jacques and Pecqueux climbed up to the foot-plate, and\r\nthe latter, opening the exhaust-pipe at a sign from his chief, a coil\r\nof white steam filled the black engine-house. Then, responding to\r\nthe handle of the regulator which the driver slowly turned, La Lison\r\nbegan to move, left the dep\xc3\xb4t, and whistled for the line to be opened.\r\nAlmost immediately the engine was able to enter the Batignolles tunnel,\r\nbut at the Pont de l\'Europe it had to wait; and it was not until the\r\nregulation time that the pointsman sent it on to the 6.30 express, to\r\nwhich a couple of porters firmly secured it.\r\n\r\nThe train was about to leave; it wanted but five minutes to the\r\ntime, and Jacques leant over the side, surprised at not perceiving\r\nS\xc3\xa9verine among the swarm of passengers. He felt certain she would not\r\nseat herself without first of all coming to the engine. At last she\r\nappeared, behind time, almost running. And, as he had foreseen, she\r\npassed all along the train and only stopped when beside the locomotive,\r\nher face crimson, exulting with joy.\r\n\r\nHer little feet went on tiptoe, her face rose up, laughing.\r\n\r\n"Do not be alarmed!" she exclaimed. "Here I am."\r\n\r\nHe also laughed, happy to see her there, and answered:\r\n\r\n"Ah! very good! That\'s all right."\r\n\r\nBut she went on tiptoe again, and resumed, in a lower tone:\r\n\r\n"My friend, I am pleased, very pleased. I have had a great piece of\r\nluck. All that I desired."\r\n\r\nHe understood perfectly, and experienced great pleasure. Then, as she\r\nwas running off, she turned round to add, in fun:\r\n\r\n"I say, don\'t you smash me up, now."\r\n\r\nAnd he gaily retorted:\r\n\r\n"Oh! what next? No fear!"\r\n\r\nBut the carriage doors were being slammed. S\xc3\xa9verine had only just time\r\nto get in. Jacques, at a signal from the chiefguard, blew the whistle,\r\nand then opened the regulator. They were off. The departure took place\r\nat the same time as that of the tragic train in February, amidst the\r\nsame activity in the station, the same sounds, the same smoke. Only it\r\nwas still daylight now, a clear crepuscule, infinitely soft. S\xc3\xa9verine,\r\nwith her head at the window of the door, looked out.\r\n\r\nJacques, standing to the right on La Lison, warmly clothed in woollen\r\ntrousers and vest, wearing spectacles with cloth sides, fastened behind\r\nhis head under his cap, henceforth never took his eyes off the line,\r\nleaning at every minute outside the cab so as to see better. Roughly\r\nshaken by the vibration, of which he was not even conscious, his right\r\nhand rested on the reversing-wheel, like that of a pilot on the wheel\r\nof the helm; and he man\xc5\x93uvred it with a movement that was imperceptible\r\nand continuous, moderating, accelerating the rapidity; while, with his\r\nleft hand, he never ceased sounding the whistle, for the exit from\r\nParis is difficult, and beset with pitfalls.\r\n\r\nHe whistled at the level crossings, at the stations, at the great\r\ncurves. A red light having appeared in the distance, as daylight\r\nvanished, he for a long time inquired if the road was free, and\r\nthen passed like lightning. It was only from time to time that he\r\ncast a glance at the steam-gauge, turning the injector-wheel as soon\r\nas the pressure reached ten kilogrammes. But it was always to the\r\npermanent way that his eyes returned, bent on observing its smallest\r\npeculiarities, and with such attention, that he saw nothing else, and\r\ndid not even feel the wind blowing a tempest. The steam-gauge falling,\r\nhe opened the door of the fire-box, raising the bars; and Pecqueux,\r\naccustomed to a gesture, understood at once. He broke up coal with his\r\nhammer, and with his shovel put on an even layer. The scorching heat\r\nburnt the legs of both of them. Then, the door once closed again, they\r\nhad to face the current of icy air.\r\n\r\nWhen night closed in, Jacques became doubly prudent. Rarely had he\r\nfound La Lison so obedient. He handled the engine as he pleased, with\r\nthe absolute will of the master; and yet he did not relax his severity,\r\nbut treated it as a tamed animal that must always be distrusted.\r\n\r\nThere, behind his back, in the train, whirling along at express speed,\r\nhe saw a delicate, confiding, smiling face. He felt a slight shiver.\r\nWith a firmer hand he grasped the reversing-wheel, piercing the\r\nincreasing darkness with fixed eyes, in search of red lights. After the\r\nembranchments at Asni\xc3\xa8res and Colombes, he breathed a little. As far as\r\nMantes all went well, the line was as a sheet of glass, and the train\r\nrolled along at ease.\r\n\r\nAfter Mantes he had to urge La Lison on, so that it might ascend\r\na rather steep incline, almost half a league long. Then, without\r\nslackening speed, he ran down the gentle slope to the Rolleboise\r\ntunnel, just about two miles in length, which he negotiated in barely\r\nthree minutes. There remained but one more tunnel, that of La Roule,\r\nnear Gaillon, before the station of Sotteville--a spot to be feared,\r\nfor the complication of the lines, the continual shunting proceeding\r\nthere, and the constant obstruction, made it exceedingly dangerous.\r\nAll the strength of his being lay in his eyes which watched, in his\r\nhand which drove; and La Lison, whistling and smoking, dashed through\r\nSotteville at full steam, only to stop at Rouen, whence it again set\r\nout, a trifle calmer, ascending more slowly the incline that extends as\r\nfar as Malaunay.\r\n\r\nA very clear moon had risen, shedding a white light, by which Jacques\r\nwas able to distinguish the smallest bushes, and even the stones on\r\nthe roads, in their rapid flight. As he cast a glance to the right, on\r\nleaving the tunnel of Malaunay, disturbed at the shadow cast across\r\nthe line by a great tree, he recognised the out-of-the-way corner,\r\nthe field full of bushes, whence he had witnessed the murder. The\r\nwild, deserted country flew past, with its continuous hills, its\r\nraw black patches of copses, its ravaged desolation. Next, at La\r\nCroix-de-Maufras, beneath the motionless moon, abruptly appeared the\r\nvision of the atrociously melancholy house set down aslant in its\r\nabandonment and distress, with its shutters everlastingly closed.\r\nAnd without understanding why, Jacques, this time again, and more\r\nvigorously than on previous occasions, felt a tightening at the heart\r\nas if he was passing before his doom.\r\n\r\nBut immediately afterwards, his eyes carried another image away. Near\r\nthe house of the Misards, against the gate at the level crossing, stood\r\nFlore. He now saw her at this spot at each of his journeys, awaiting,\r\non the watch for him. She did not move, she simply turned her head\r\nso as to be able to get a longer view of him in the flash that bore\r\nhim away. Her tall silhouette stood out in black, against the white\r\nlight, her golden locks alone being illumined by the pale gold of the\r\ncelestial body.\r\n\r\nAnd Jacques, having urged on La Lison, to make it scale the ascent at\r\nMotteville, allowed the engine breathing time across the plateau of\r\nBolbec. But he finally sent it on again, from Saint-Romain to Harfleur,\r\ndown the longest incline on the line, a matter of three leagues, which\r\nthe engines devour at the gallop of mad cattle sniffing the stable.\r\nAnd he was broken down with fatigue at Havre, when, beneath the iron\r\nmarquee, full of the uproar and smoke at the arrival, S\xc3\xa9verine, before\r\ngoing up to her rooms, ran to say to him, in her gay and tender manner:\r\n\r\n"Thanks. We may see one another to-morrow."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\nA month passed, and great tranquillity again pervaded the lodging\r\noccupied by the Roubauds, on the first floor of the railway station,\r\nover the waiting-rooms. With them, with their neighbours in the\r\ncorridor, with all this little crowd of public servants subjected to an\r\nexistence regulated by the clock, life had resumed its monotony. And it\r\nseemed as if nothing violent or abnormal had taken place.\r\n\r\nThe noisy and scandalous Grandmorin case was quietly being forgotten,\r\nwas about to be shelved, owing to the apparent inability of the\r\nauthorities to discover the criminal. After Cabuche had been locked\r\nup a fortnight, the examining-magistrate, Denizet, had ordered his\r\ndischarge, on the ground that there was not sufficient evidence against\r\nhim. And a romantic fable was now being arranged by the police: that of\r\nan unknown murderer on whom it was impossible to lay hands, a criminal\r\nadventurer, who was everywhere at the same time, who was accused of\r\nall the murders, and who vanished in smoke, at the mere sight of the\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\nIt was now only at long intervals that a few jokes about this fabulous\r\nmurderer were revived in the opposition press, which became intensely\r\nexcited as the general elections drew near. The pressure of the\r\ngovernment, the violence of the prefects, every day furnished other\r\nsubjects for indignant articles; and the newspapers were so busy with\r\nthese matters that they gave no further attention to the case. It had\r\nceased to interest the public, who no longer even spoke on the subject.\r\n\r\nWhat had completed the tranquillity of the Roubauds was the happy way\r\nin which the other difficulty, connected with the will of President\r\nGrandmorin, had been smoothed over.\r\n\r\nOn the advice of Madame Bonnehon, the Lachesnayes had at last consented\r\nto accept the will, partly because they did not wish to revive the\r\nscandal, and also because they were very uncertain as to the result of\r\nan action. And the Roubauds, placed in possession of their legacy, had\r\nfor the past week been the owners of La Croix-de-Maufras, house and\r\ngarden, estimated to be worth about 40,000 frcs., a matter of \xc2\xa31,600.\r\n\r\nThey had immediately decided on selling the place, which haunted them\r\nlike a nightmare, and on selling it in a lump, with the furniture, just\r\nas it stood, without repairing it, and without even sweeping out the\r\ndust. But, as it would not have fetched anything like its value at an\r\nauction, there being few purchasers who would consent to retire to such\r\nsolitude, they had resolved to await an amateur, and had nailed up an\r\nimmense board on the front of the house, setting forth that it was for\r\nsale, which could easily be read by persons in the frequent trains that\r\npassed.\r\n\r\nThis notice in great letters, this desolation to be disposed of, added\r\nto the sadness of the closed shutters, and of the garden invaded with\r\nbriars. Roubaud, having absolutely refused to go there, even to take\r\na look round, and make certain necessary arrangements, S\xc3\xa9verine had\r\npaid a visit to the house one afternoon, and had left the keys with the\r\nMisards, telling them to show any possible purchasers who might make\r\ninquiries, over the property. Possession could be arranged in a couple\r\nof hours, for there was even linen in the cupboards.\r\n\r\nAnd from that moment, there being nothing further to trouble the\r\nRoubauds, they passed each day in blissful expectation of the morrow.\r\nThe house would end by being sold, they would invest the money, and\r\neverything would go on very well. Besides, they forgot all about\r\nit, living as if they were never going to quit the three rooms they\r\noccupied: the dining-room, with the door opening on the corridor; the\r\nbedroom, fairly large, on the right; the small, stuffy kitchen on the\r\nleft.\r\n\r\nEven the roofing over the platforms, before their windows, that zinc\r\nslope shutting out the view like the wall of a prison, instead of\r\nexasperating them, as formerly, seemed to bring calm, increasing that\r\nsensation of infinite repose, of recomforting peace, wherein they felt\r\nsecure. In any case, the neighbours could not see them, there were\r\nno prying eyes always in front of them peering into their home; and,\r\nspring having set in, they now only complained of the stifling heat, of\r\nthe blinding reflex from the zinc, fired by the first rays of the sun.\r\n\r\nAfter that frightful shock, which for two months had caused them to\r\nlive in a constant tremble, they enjoyed this reaction of absorbing\r\ninsensibility, in perfect bliss. They only desired never to move again,\r\nhappy to be simply alive, without trembling and without suffering.\r\n\r\nNever had Roubaud been so exact and conscientious. During the week of\r\nday duty, he was on the platform at five in the morning. He did not go\r\nup to breakfast until ten, and came down again an hour later, remaining\r\nthere until five in the evening--eleven hours full of work. During the\r\nweek of night duty, he had not even the brief rest afforded by a meal\r\nat home, for he supped in his office. He bore this hard servitude with\r\na sort of satisfaction, seeming to take pleasure in it, entering into\r\ndetails, wishing to see to everything, to do everything, as if he found\r\noblivion in fatigue; the return of a well-balanced, normal life.\r\n\r\nS\xc3\xa9verine, for her part, almost always alone, a widow one week out of\r\ntwo, and who during the other week, only saw her husband at luncheon\r\nand dinner-time, displayed all the energy of a good housewife. She\r\nhad been in the habit of sitting down to embroidery, detesting to\r\nput her hand to household work, which an old woman, called Mother\r\nSimon, came to do, from nine to twelve. But since she had recovered\r\ntranquillity at home, and felt certain of remaining there, she had\r\nbeen occupied with ideas of cleaning and arranging things; and she now\r\nonly seated herself, after rummaging everywhere in the apartment. Both\r\nslept soundly. In their rare conversations at meal-times, as on the\r\nnights which they passed together, they never once alluded to the case,\r\nconsidering it at an end, and buried.\r\n\r\nFor S\xc3\xa9verine, particularly, life once more became extremely pleasant.\r\nHer idleness returned. Again she abandoned the housework to Mother\r\nSimon, like a young lady brought up for no greater exertion than fine\r\nneedlework. She had commenced an interminable task, consisting in\r\nembroidering an entire bedcover, which threatened to occupy her to the\r\nend of her days. She rose rather late, delighted to remain alone in\r\nbed, rocked by the trains leaving and coming in, which told her how the\r\nhours fled, as exactly as if her eyes had been on a clock.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of her married life, these violent sounds in the\r\nstation--the whistling, the shocks of turn-tables, the rolls of\r\nthunder, the abrupt oscillations, like earthquakes, which made both her\r\nand the furniture totter--had driven her half crazy. Then, by degrees,\r\nshe had become accustomed to them; the sonorous and vibrating railway\r\nstation formed part of her existence; and, now, she liked it, finding\r\ntranquillity in all this bustle and uproar.\r\n\r\nUntil lunch-time, she went from one room to another, talking to the\r\ncharwoman, with her hands idle. Then, she passed the long afternoons,\r\nseated before the dining-room window, with her work generally on her\r\nlap, delighted at doing nothing. During the weeks when her husband\r\ncame up at daylight, to go to bed, she heard him snoring until dark;\r\nand these had become her good weeks--those during which she lived\r\nas formerly, before her marriage, having the whole bed to herself,\r\nenjoying her time after rising, as she thought proper, with the entire\r\nday before her, to do as she liked.\r\n\r\nShe rarely went out. All she could see of Havre, was the smoke of the\r\nneighbouring factories, whose great turbillions of black stained the\r\nsky above the zinc roof, which shut out the view at a few yards from\r\nher eyes.\r\n\r\nThe city was there, behind this perpetual wall; she always felt its\r\npresence, and her annoyance at being unable to see it had, in the\r\nend, subsided. Five or six pots of wallflowers and verbenas, which\r\nshe cultivated in the gutter, gave her a small garden to enliven her\r\nsolitude. At times she spoke of herself as of a recluse in the depths\r\nof a wood. Roubaud, in his moments of idleness, would get out of the\r\nwindow, then, passing to the end of the gutter, would ascend the zinc\r\nslope, seating himself on the top of the gable, overlooking the Cours\r\nNapol\xc3\xa9on. There he smoked his pipe, in the open air, towering above the\r\ncity that lay spread out at his feet, above the docks planted with tall\r\nmasts, and the pale green sea, expanding as far as the eye could roam.\r\n\r\nIt seemed that the same somnolence had gained the other households,\r\nnear the Roubauds. This corridor, where generally whistled such a\r\nterrible gale of gossip, was also wrapt in slumber. When Philom\xc3\xa8ne paid\r\na visit to Madame Lebleu, barely a slight murmur could be heard. Both\r\nof them, surprised at the turn matters had taken, now spoke of the\r\nassistant station-master with disdainful commiseration, convinced that\r\nhis wife, to keep him in his post, had been up to her games at Paris.\r\n\r\nHe was now a man with a slur upon him, who would never free himself\r\nof certain suspicions. And, as the wife of the cashier felt convinced\r\nthat, henceforth, her neighbours would not have the power to take her\r\nlodging from her, she simply treated them with contempt, stiffening\r\nherself when she passed them, and neglecting to bow. This behaviour\r\neven estranged Philom\xc3\xa8ne, who called on her less and less frequently.\r\nShe considered her too proud, and no longer found amusement in her\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\nMadame Lebleu, in order to have something to occupy her, continued to\r\nwatch the intrigue between Mademoiselle Guichon and the station-master,\r\nM. Dabadie, but without ever surprising them. The almost imperceptible\r\nbrush of his felt slippers along the corridor, could alone be heard.\r\nEverything having thus settled down, a month of supreme peacefulness\r\nensued, similar to the great calm that follows great catastrophes.\r\n\r\nBut one painful, anxious matter remained, to occasionally worry\r\nthe Roubauds. There was a particular part of the parquetry in the\r\ndining-room, whereon their eyes never chanced to rest, without an\r\nuncomfortable feeling again troubling them. This spot was to the\r\nleft of the window. There they had taken up and put in place again,\r\na piece of the pattern in the oak flooring, to hide beneath it the\r\nwatch, and the 10,000 frcs. (\xc2\xa3400) which they had taken from the body\r\nof Grandmorin, as well as a purse containing about 300 frcs. (\xc2\xa312) in\r\ngold. Roubaud had only drawn the watch and money from the pockets of\r\nthe victim, to convey the impression that the motive of the crime was\r\nrobbery.\r\n\r\nHe was not a thief. He would sooner die of hunger within arms\' reach of\r\nthe treasure, as he said, than profit by a centime, or sell the watch.\r\nThe money of this old man, to whom he had dealt out justice--money,\r\nstained with infamy and blood? No! no! it was not clean enough for an\r\nhonest man to finger. And he did not even give a thought to the house\r\nat La Croix-de-Maufras, which he had accepted as a present. The act of\r\nplundering the victim, of carrying off those notes in the abomination\r\nof murder, alone revolted him and aroused his conscience to the\r\npitch of making him start back in fright at the idea of touching the\r\nill-gotten gain.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, he had not had the courage to burn the notes; and then,\r\none night, to go and cast watch and purse in the sea. If simple\r\nprudence urged him to act thus, inexorable instinct protested against\r\nthe destruction. Unconsciously, he felt respect for such a large sum\r\nof money, and he could never have made up his mind to annihilate\r\nit. At the commencement, on the first night, he had thrust it under\r\nhis pillow, considering no other place sufficiently secure. On the\r\nfollowing days, he had exerted his ingenuity to discover hiding-places,\r\nchanging them each morning, agitated at the least sound, in fear of the\r\npolice arriving with a search-warrant. Never had he displayed so much\r\nimagination.\r\n\r\nAt last, at the end of artifices, weary of trembling, he one day had\r\nthe coolness to take the money and watch, hidden the previous evening\r\nunder the parquetry; and, now, for nothing in the world would he put\r\nhis hand there. It was like a charnel house, a hole pregnant with\r\nterror and death, where spectres awaited him. He even avoided, when\r\nmoving about the room, to place his feet on that part of the floor. The\r\nidea of doing so, caused him an unpleasant sensation, made him fancy he\r\nwould receive a slight shock in the legs.\r\n\r\nWhen S\xc3\xa9verine sat down before the window in the afternoon, she would\r\ndraw back her chair so as not to be exactly over this skeleton which\r\nthey kept under their floor. They never spoke of the matter to one\r\nanother, endeavouring to think they would get accustomed to it; and,\r\nat length, they became irritable at remembering the thing again, at\r\nfeeling it there at every hour, more and more importunate, beneath the\r\nsoles of their boots. And this uncomfortable sensation was all the more\r\nsingular, as they in no way suffered from the knife, the beautiful\r\nnew knife purchased by the wife, and which the husband had stuck into\r\nthe throat of the sweetheart. It had been simply washed, and lay in a\r\ndrawer. Sometimes Mother Simon used it to cut the bread.\r\n\r\nAmidst the peacefulness in which they were living, Roubaud had just\r\nintroduced another cause of trouble, which was slowly gaining ground,\r\nby forcing Jacques to visit them. The duties of the engine-driver\r\nbrought him three times a week to Havre. On Monday, from 10.35 in\r\nthe morning, to 6.20 at night. On Thursday and Saturday, from 11.05\r\nat night, to 6.40 in the morning. And on the first Monday after the\r\njourney S\xc3\xa9verine had made to Paris, the assistant station-master\r\ndisplayed effusive affability towards him.\r\n\r\n"Come, comrade," said he, "you cannot refuse to have a snack with\r\nus. The deuce! you were very obliging to my wife, and I owe you some\r\nthanks!"\r\n\r\nTwice in a month, Jacques had thus accepted an invitation to lunch.\r\nIt seemed that Roubaud, inconvenienced at the long silence that now\r\nprevailed when he met his wife at table, felt a relief as soon as\r\nhe could place a guest between them. He at once recalled amusing\r\nanecdotes, chatted and joked.\r\n\r\n"Come as often as possible," said he; "you can see you are not in the\r\nway."\r\n\r\nOne Thursday night, as Jacques, who had washed himself, was thinking of\r\ngoing off to bed, he met the assistant station-master strolling round\r\nthe dep\xc3\xb4t; and, notwithstanding the late hour, the latter, disinclined\r\nto walk back alone, persuaded the young man to accompany him to the\r\nstation. Once there he insisted on taking him to his rooms. S\xc3\xa9verine\r\nwas still up, and reading. They drank a glass or two together, and\r\nplayed cards until after midnight.\r\n\r\nHenceforth the luncheons on Monday, and the little evening parties\r\non Thursday and Saturday, became a habit. It was Roubaud, himself,\r\nwhen the comrade once missed a day, who kept a look-out for him, and\r\nbrought him home, reproaching him with his neglect. But he became more\r\nand more gloomy, and it was only in the company of his new friend\r\nthat he was really in good spirits. This man, who had first of all so\r\ncruelly alarmed him, whom he should now have held in execration as\r\nthe witness--the living vision of things he wished to forget--had, on\r\nthe contrary, become necessary to him, perhaps for the simple reason\r\nthat he knew what had occurred, and had not spoken. This position took\r\nthe form of a powerful bond, a sort of complicity between them. The\r\nassistant station-master had often looked at the other in a knowing\r\nway, pressing his hand with a sudden burst of feeling, and with a\r\nviolence that surpassed the simple expression of good fellowship.\r\n\r\nBut it was particularly at home that Jacques became a source of\r\ndiversion. There, S\xc3\xa9verine also welcomed him with gaiety, uttering an\r\nexclamation as soon as he entered, like a woman bestirred by a thrill\r\nof pleasure. She put aside everything--her embroidery, her book,\r\nescaping from the gloomy somnolence, in which she passed her time, in a\r\ntorrent of words and laughter.\r\n\r\n"Ah! how nice of you to have come! I heard the express, and thought of\r\nyou," she would say.\r\n\r\nWhen he lunched there, it was a f\xc3\xaate. She had already learnt his\r\ntastes, and went out herself for fresh eggs. And she did this in a very\r\nnice way, like a good housewife who welcomes the friend of the family,\r\nwithout giving him any cause to attribute her actions to aught else\r\nthan a desire to be agreeable, and divert herself.\r\n\r\n"Come again on Monday, you know," said she. "We shall have cream."\r\n\r\nOnly, when at the end of the month, he had made himself at home there,\r\nthe separation between the Roubauds became more pronounced. Jacques\r\ncertainly assisted to bring about this informal divorce by his\r\npresence, which drew them from the gloom into which they had fallen. He\r\ndelivered both of them.\r\n\r\nRoubaud had no remorse. He had only been afraid of the consequences,\r\nbefore the case was shelved, and his greatest anxiety had been the\r\ndread of losing his place. At present, he felt no regret. Perhaps,\r\nthough, had he to do the business over again, he would not make his\r\nwife take a part in it. Women lose their spirit at once. His wife was\r\nescaping from him, because he had placed on her shoulders, a load too\r\nheavy to bear. He would have remained the master, had he not descended\r\nwith her to the terrifying and quarrelsome comradeship of crime.\r\n\r\nBut this was how things were, and it became imperative to put up with\r\nthem; the more so, as he had to make a regular effort, to place himself\r\nagain in the same frame of mind, as when, after the confession, he had\r\nconsidered the murder necessary to his existence. It seemed to him, at\r\nthat time, that if he had not killed this man, he would not have been\r\nable to live. At present, his jealous flame having died out, himself\r\nfreed from the intolerable burn, assailed by a feeling of torpidity, as\r\nif the blood of his heart had become thickened by all the blood he had\r\nspilt, the necessity for the murder did not appear to him so evident.\r\n\r\nHe had come to the pass of inquiring of himself, whether killing was\r\nreally worth the trouble. This was not repentance; it was at most\r\na disillusion, the idea that people often do things they would not\r\nown to, in order to become happy, without being any the more so. He,\r\nusually so talkative, fell into prolonged spells of silence, into\r\nconfused reflections, from which he issued more gloomy than before.\r\nEvery day, now, to avoid remaining face to face with his wife, after\r\nthe meals, he went on the roof and seated himself on the gable. There,\r\nin the breeze from the offing, soothing himself in vague dreams, he\r\nsmoked his pipe, gazing beyond the city at the steamers disappearing\r\non the horizon, bound to distant seas.\r\n\r\nBut one evening, Roubaud felt a revival of that savage jealousy of\r\nformer times. He had been to find Jacques at the dep\xc3\xb4t, and was\r\nbringing him up to his rooms to take a dram, when he met Henri\r\nDauvergne, the headguard, coming down the staircase. The latter\r\nappeared confused, and explained that he had been to see Madame Roubaud\r\non an errand confided to him by his sisters. The truth was that for\r\nsome time past, he had been running after S\xc3\xa9verine, to make love to her.\r\n\r\nThe assistant station-master violently addressed his wife at the door.\r\n\r\n"What did that fellow come up again about?" he roughly inquired. "You\r\nknow that he plagues me!"\r\n\r\n"But, my dear, it was for a pattern of embroidery," she answered.\r\n\r\n"Embroidery, indeed!" he rejoined. "I\'ll give him embroidery! Do you\r\nthink I\'m such a fool as not to understand what he comes here for? And\r\nas to you, take care!"\r\n\r\nHe advanced towards her, his fists clenched, and she stepped back,\r\nwhite as a sheet, astonished at the violence of this anger, in the\r\nstate of calm indifference for one another, in which they lived. But\r\nhe was already recovering his self-possession, and, addressing his\r\ncompanion, he said:\r\n\r\n"Whoever heard of such a thing? Fellows who tumble into your home with\r\nthe idea that your wife will immediately fall into their arms, and that\r\nthe husband, very much flattered, will shut his eyes! It makes my blood\r\nboil. Look here, if such a thing did happen, I would strangle my wife,\r\noh! on the spot! And this young gentleman had better not show his face\r\nhere again, or I\'ll settle his business for him. Isn\'t it disgusting?"\r\n\r\nJacques, who felt very uncomfortable at the scene, hardly knew how to\r\nlook. Was this exaggerated anger intended for him? Was the husband\r\ngiving him a warning? He felt more at ease when the latter gaily\r\nresumed:\r\n\r\n"As to you, I know you would very soon fling him out at the door. No\r\nmatter. S\xc3\xa9verine, bring us something to drink out of. Jacques, touch\r\nglasses with us."\r\n\r\nHe patted Jacques on the shoulder, and S\xc3\xa9verine, who had also\r\nrecovered, smiled at the two men. Then they all drank together, and\r\npassed a very pleasant hour.\r\n\r\nIt was thus that Roubaud brought his wife and comrade together, with an\r\nair of good friendship, and without seeming to think of the possible\r\nconsequences. This outburst of jealousy became the very cause of a\r\ncloser intimacy, and of a great deal of secret tenderness, strengthened\r\nby outpourings of the heart, between Jacques and S\xc3\xa9verine. For, having\r\nseen her again two days after this scene, he expressed his pity that\r\nshe should have been the object of such brutal treatment; while she,\r\nwith eyes bathed in tears, confessed, with an involuntary overflow of\r\ngrief, what little happiness she met with in her home.\r\n\r\nFrom that moment, they had found a subject of conversation for\r\nthemselves alone, a complicity of friendship wherein they ended by\r\nunderstanding one another at a sign. At each visit, he questioned\r\nher with his eyes, to ascertain if she had met with any fresh cause\r\nfor sadness. She answered in the same way, by a simple motion of the\r\neyelids. Moreover, their hands sought each other behind the back of\r\nthe husband. Becoming bolder, they corresponded by long pressures,\r\nrelating, at the tips of their warm fingers, the increasing interest\r\nthe one took in the smallest incidents connected with the existence of\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nRarely did they have the good fortune to meet for a minute, in the\r\nabsence of Roubaud. They always found him there, between them, in that\r\nmelancholy dining-room; and they did nothing to escape him, never\r\nhaving had the thought to make an appointment at some distant corner\r\nof the station. Up to then, it was a matter of real affection between\r\nthem; they were led along by keen sympathy, and Roubaud caused them but\r\nslight inconvenience, as a glance, a pressure of the hand, sufficed for\r\nthem to comprehend one another.\r\n\r\nThe first time Jacques whispered in the ear of S\xc3\xa9verine, that he\r\nwould wait for her on the following Thursday at midnight, behind the\r\ndep\xc3\xb4t, she revolted, and violently withdrew her hand. It was her week\r\nof liberty, the week when her husband was engaged on night duty. But\r\nshe was very much troubled at the thought of leaving her home, to go\r\nand meet this young man so far away, in the darkness of the station\r\npremises. Never had she felt so confused. It resembled the fright of\r\ninnocent maids with throbbing hearts. She did not give way at once.\r\nHe had to beg and pray of her for more than a fortnight, before\r\nshe consented, notwithstanding her own burning desire to take this\r\nnocturnal walk.\r\n\r\nIt was at the commencement of June. The evenings became intensely hot,\r\nand were but slightly refreshed by the sea breeze. Jacques had already\r\nwaited for her three times, always in the hope that she would join\r\nhim, notwithstanding her refusal. On this particular night, she had\r\nagain said no. The sky was without a moon, and cloudy. Not a star shone\r\nthrough the dense haze that obscured everything. As he stood watching\r\nin the dark, he perceived her coming along at last, attired in black,\r\nand with silent tread. It was so sombre that she would have brushed\r\nagainst him without recognising him, had he not caught her in his\r\narms and given her a kiss. She uttered a little cry, quivering. Then,\r\nlaughingly, she left her lips on his. But that was all; she would never\r\nconsent to sit down in one of the sheds surrounding them. They walked\r\nabout, and chatted in low tones, pressing one to the other.\r\n\r\nJust there, was a vast open space, occupied by the dep\xc3\xb4t and other\r\nbuildings, all the land that is shut in by the Rue Verte and the Rue\r\nFran\xc3\xa7ois-Mazeline, both of which cut the line at level crossings:\r\na sort of immense piece of waste ground, encumbered with shunting\r\nlines, reservoirs, water-cranes, buildings of all sorts--the two\r\ngreat engine-houses, the cottage of the Sauvagnats, surrounded by a\r\ntiny kitchen-garden, the workshops, the block where the drivers and\r\nfiremen slept. And nothing was more easy than to escape observation,\r\nto lose oneself, as in the thick of a wood, among those deserted lanes\r\nwith their inextricable maze of turnings. For an hour, they enjoyed\r\ndelicious solitude, relieving their hearts in friendly words stored-up\r\nthere so long. For she would only consent to speak of affection. She\r\nhad told him, at once, that she would never be his, that it would be\r\ntoo wicked to tarnish this pure friendship, of which she felt so proud,\r\nbeing jealous of her own self-esteem. Then he accompanied her to the\r\nRue Verte, where their lips joined in a long kiss, and she returned\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nAt that same hour, in the office of the assistant station-masters,\r\nRoubaud began to doze in an old leather armchair, which he quitted\r\ntwenty times in the course of the night, with aching limbs. Up to nine\r\no\'clock, he had to be present at the arrival and departure of the night\r\ntrains. The tidal train engaged his particular attention: there were\r\nthe man\xc5\x93uvres, the coupling, the way-bills to be closely scrutinised.\r\nThen, when the Paris express had arrived and had been shunted, he\r\nsupped alone in the office at a corner of the table, off a slice of\r\ncold meat between a couple of pieces of bread, which he had brought\r\ndown from his lodging. The last arrival, a slow train from Rouen,\r\nsteamed in at half past twelve. The platforms then became quite silent.\r\nOnly a few lamps remained alight, and the entire station lay at rest,\r\nin this quivering semi-obscurity.\r\n\r\nOf all the staff there remained but a couple of foremen, and four or\r\nfive porters, under the orders of the assistant station-master. They\r\nslept like tops on the sloping plank platform in the quarters allotted\r\nto them; while Roubaud, obliged to rouse them at the least warning,\r\ncould only doze with his ears open. Lest he should succumb to fatigue,\r\ntowards daybreak, he set his alarum at five o\'clock, at which hour he\r\nhad to be on his feet, to be present at the arrival of the Paris train.\r\nBut, occasionally, especially recently, he suffered from insomnia, and\r\nturned about in his armchair without being able to close his eyes. Then\r\nhe would get up and go out, take a look round, walk as far as the box\r\nof the pointsman, where he chatted an instant. And the vast black sky,\r\nthe sovereign peacefulness of the night, ultimately calmed his fever.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of a struggle with marauders, he had been supplied with\r\na revolver, which he carried loaded in his pocket. And he often walked\r\nabout in this way, up to daybreak, stopping as soon as he perceived\r\nanything moving in the darkness, resuming his walk with a sort of vague\r\nfeeling of regret at not having had to make use of his weapon. He felt\r\nrelieved when the sky whitened, and drew the great pale phantom of the\r\nstation from darkness. Now that day broke as early as three o\'clock\r\nhe went in, and, throwing himself into his armchair, slept like a\r\ndormouse, until his alarum brought him, with a start, to his feet.\r\n\r\nS\xc3\xa9verine met Jacques once a fortnight, on Thursday and Saturday. And,\r\none night, when she had told him about the revolver, they both felt\r\nconsiderably alarmed. As a matter of fact, Roubaud never went so far\r\nas the dep\xc3\xb4t. But this circumstance did not divest their walks of\r\nan aspect of danger, which added to their charm. Moreover, they had\r\nfound a delightful nook, behind the cottage of the Sauvagnats, a sort\r\nof alley, between some enormous heaps of coal, which formed the only\r\nstreet in a strange town of great, square, black-marble palaces. There,\r\nthey were completely hidden.\r\n\r\nThis girl, who had killed, was his ideal. His cure seemed to him more\r\ncertain every day, because he had fondled her, his lips upon her lips,\r\nabsorbing her very soul, without that furious envy having been aroused,\r\nto master her by slaughtering her.\r\n\r\nAnd so these happy meetings followed one upon another. The two\r\nsweethearts never wearied for a moment of seeking one another, of\r\nstrolling together in the obscurity, between the great heaps of coal\r\nthat deepened the darkness around them.\r\n\r\nOne night in July, Jacques, to reach Havre at 11.05, the fixed time, had\r\nto urge on La Lison, as if the stifling heat had made the engine idle.\r\nFrom Rouen, a storm accompanied him on the left, following the valley\r\nof the Seine, with great brilliant flashes; and, from time to time, he\r\nturned round anxiously, for S\xc3\xa9verine was to meet him that night. He\r\nfeared that if this storm burst too soon, it would prevent her going\r\nout. And so, when he had succeeded in attaining the station before the\r\nrain, he felt impatient with the passengers, who seemed as if they\r\nwould never finish leaving the carriages.\r\n\r\nRoubaud was on the platform, glued there for the night.\r\n\r\n"The deuce!" said he, laughing. "What a hurry you\'re in to get off to\r\nbed! Pleasant dreams!"\r\n\r\n"Thanks," answered Jacques.\r\n\r\nAfter driving back the train, he whistled, and made his way to the\r\ndep\xc3\xb4t. The flaps of the immense door were open. La Lison penetrated the\r\nengine-house, a sort of gallery with double lines, about sixty yards\r\nlong, and built to accommodate six locomotives. Within, it was very\r\ndark. Four gas-burners did not suffice to dispel the obscurity, which\r\nthey seemed to deepen into four great moving shadows. But, at moments,\r\nthe vivid flashes of lightning, set the glazed roof and the tall\r\nwindows to right and left, ablaze; and one then distinguished, as in a\r\nflame of fire, the cracked walls, the timber black with smoke, all the\r\ntumble-down wretchedness of this out-of-date building. Two locomotives\r\nwere already there, cold and slumbering.\r\n\r\nPecqueux at once began to put out the fire. He violently raked it, and,\r\nthe live coal escaping from the cinder-box, fell into the pit below.\r\n\r\n"I\'m dying of hunger," said he. "I shall go and have a mouthful. Are\r\nyou coming?"\r\n\r\nJacques did not reply. In spite of his hurry, he did not wish to leave\r\nLa Lison before the lights had been extinguished, and the boiler\r\nemptied. This was a scruple, the habit of a good driver, wherefrom\r\nhe never departed. When he had time, he remained there until he had\r\nexamined and wiped everything, with all the care that is taken to groom\r\na favourite nag.\r\n\r\nIt was only when the water ran gurgling into the pit, that he exclaimed:\r\n\r\n"Hurry on, hurry on!"\r\n\r\nA formidable flash of lightning interrupted him. This time, the tall\r\nwindows stood out so distinctly against the flaming sky, that the very\r\nnumerous broken panes of glass could have been counted. To the left,\r\na thin sheet of iron, which had remained fixed in one of the vices\r\nserving for the repairs, resounded with the prolonged vibration of a\r\nbell. All the antiquated timber-work of the roof had cracked.\r\n\r\n"The devil!" simply said the fireman.\r\n\r\nThe driver made a gesture of despair. This put an end to his\r\nappointment, and the more so, as a perfect deluge was now pouring down\r\non the engine-house. The violence of the rain threatened to break the\r\nglazed roof. Up there some of the panes of glass must also have been\r\nbroken, for big raindrops were falling on La Lison in clusters. A\r\nviolent wind entered by the doors which had been left open, and anyone\r\nmight have fancied that the body of the old structure was about to be\r\nswept away.\r\n\r\nPecqueux was getting to the end of his work on the locomotive.\r\n\r\n"There!" said he; "we shall be able to see better to-morrow. I have no\r\nneed to tidy it up any more to-night."\r\n\r\nAnd, returning to his former idea, he added:\r\n\r\n"I must get something to eat. It\'s raining too hard to go and stick\r\noneself on one\'s mattress."\r\n\r\nThe canteen, indeed, was at hand, against the dep\xc3\xb4t itself; while the\r\ncompany had been obliged to rent a house--Rue Fran\xc3\xa7ois-Mazeline--where\r\nbeds had been provided for the drivers and firemen who passed the night\r\nat Havre. In such a deluge, they would have got drenched to the skin\r\nbefore arriving there.\r\n\r\nJacques had to make up his mind to follow Pecqueux, who had taken\r\nthe small basket belonging to his chief, to save him the trouble of\r\ncarrying it. He knew that this basket still contained two slices of\r\ncold veal, some bread, and a bottle of wine that had hardly been\r\ntouched; and it was simply this knowledge that made him feel hungry.\r\nThe rain increased. Another clap of thunder had just shaken the\r\nengine-house. When the two men went away on the left, by the small door\r\nleading to the canteen, La Lison was already becoming cold. The engine\r\nslumbered, abandoned, in the obscurity, lit up by the vivid flashes of\r\nlightning, with the heavy drops of rain falling on its flanks. Hard by,\r\na water-crane, imperfectly turned off, continued dripping, and formed a\r\npool that ran between the wheels of the locomotive into the pit.\r\n\r\nBut Jacques wished to wash before entering the canteen. Warm water and\r\nbuckets were always to be found in an adjoining room. Drawing a piece\r\nof soap from his basket, he removed the dirt from his travel-begrimed\r\nhands and face; and, as he had taken the precaution to bring a second\r\nlot of clothes with him, in accordance with the advice given to the\r\ndrivers, he was able to change his garments from head to foot, as he\r\nwas accustomed to do, for that matter, each night on his arrival at\r\nHavre, when he had an appointment with S\xc3\xa9verine. Pecqueux was already\r\nwaiting in the canteen, having only just dipped the tip of his nose,\r\nand the ends of his fingers, in the water.\r\n\r\nThis canteen simply consisted of a small, bare room painted yellow,\r\nwhere there was nothing but a stove to warm the food, and a table fixed\r\nin the ground, and covered with a sheet of zinc, by way of tablecloth.\r\nA couple of forms completed the furniture. The men had to bring their\r\nown victuals, and eat off a piece of paper with the points of their\r\nknives. Light entered the room through a large window.\r\n\r\n"What a vile downpour!" exclaimed Jacques, planting himself before the\r\npanes of glass.\r\n\r\nPecqueux had settled himself on a form at the table.\r\n\r\n"You are not going to eat then?" he inquired.\r\n\r\n"No, mate. Finish my bread and meat, if you care for it. I\'ve no\r\nappetite."\r\n\r\nThe other, without more ado, fell upon the veal, and emptied the\r\nbottle. He frequently met with similar luck, for his chief was a poor\r\neater; and he loved him the better, in his canine-like fidelity, for\r\nall the crumbs picked up in this way, behind him. With his mouth full,\r\nhe resumed after a silence:\r\n\r\n"The rain! What do we care about that, so long as we\'re under cover?\r\nOnly, if it continues, I shall cut you, and be off next door."\r\n\r\nHe began laughing, for he made no secret of his mode of life; and,\r\nno doubt, had told the driver all about his intrigue with Philom\xc3\xa8ne\r\nSauvagnat.\r\n\r\nJacques muttered an oath, as he perceived the deluge of rain increase\r\nin violence, after showing signs of abating.\r\n\r\nPecqueux, with the last mouthful of meat at the end of his knife, again\r\ngave a good-humoured laugh.\r\n\r\n"You must have something to do then, to-night?" said he. "Well, they\r\ncan\'t reproach us two with wearing out the mattresses, over there, in\r\nthe Rue Fran\xc3\xa7ois-Mazeline."\r\n\r\nJacques quickly left the window.\r\n\r\n"Why?" he inquired.\r\n\r\n"Well, you\'re just like me. Since the spring, you never turn in till\r\ntwo or three o\'clock in the morning," answered the other.\r\n\r\nHe seemed to know something. Perhaps he had caught them together.\r\nIn each room the bedsteads were in couples: fireman and driver. The\r\nrailway authorities sought to bind these men to one another as firmly\r\nas possible, on account of their work, which necessitated such a close\r\nunderstanding. And so, Jacques was not astonished that the fireman\r\nshould have noticed the late hours he kept, particularly as he had\r\nformerly been so regular.\r\n\r\n"I suffer from headache," remarked the driver, for want of something\r\nbetter to say; "and it does me good to walk out at night-time."\r\n\r\nBut the fireman was already excusing himself.\r\n\r\n"Oh! you know," he broke in, "you are free to do as you please. What\r\nI said, was only by way of a joke. And if you should meet with any\r\ntrouble one of these days, don\'t mind coming to me, because I\'m ready\r\nto do anything you like."\r\n\r\nWithout explaining his meaning more clearly, Pecqueux grasped him by\r\nthe hand, pressing it fit to crush it, so as to make him understand\r\nthat he was at his service, body and soul. Then, crumpling up the\r\ngreasy paper which the meat had been in, he threw it away, and placed\r\nthe empty bottle in the basket, performing this little service like a\r\ncareful servant accustomed to the broom and sponge. And, as the rain\r\nobstinately continued, although the thunder had ceased, he exclaimed:\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'m off, and leave you to your own business!"\r\n\r\n"Oh!" said Jacques, "as there are no signs of it clearing up, I shall\r\ngo and lie down on a camp bedstead!"\r\n\r\nBeside the dep\xc3\xb4t was a room with mattresses protected by canvas slips,\r\nwhere the men rested in their clothes when they had only to wait\r\nthree or four hours at Havre. So, as soon as Jacques saw the fireman\r\ndisappear in the downpour of rain, he risked it in his turn, and ran\r\nto the drivers\' quarters. But he did not lie down. He stood on the\r\nthreshold of the wide-open door, stifled by the oppressive heat within,\r\nwhere another driver, stretched on his back, was snoring with his mouth\r\nwide open.\r\n\r\nA few more minutes passed, and Jacques could not make up his mind to\r\nabandon all hope. In his exasperation against this disgusting rain,\r\nhe felt an increasing wild desire to gain, in spite of all, the place\r\nwhere he and S\xc3\xa9verine were to meet; so as at least to have the pleasure\r\nof being there himself, even if he no longer expected to find his\r\nsweetheart. With spasmodic precipitation, he at last dashed through\r\nthe rain. He reached their favourite corner, and followed the dark\r\nalley formed by the heaps of coal. And, as the sharp rain whipped his\r\nface and blinded him, he went as far as the tool-house, where he and\r\nS\xc3\xa9verine had already once found shelter. He seemed to think he would be\r\nless lonely there.\r\n\r\nJacques was entering the dense obscurity of this retreat when a couple\r\nof slender arms entwined him, and a pair of warm lips rested on his\r\nown. S\xc3\xa9verine was there.\r\n\r\n"Goodness gracious! is it you?" he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n"Yes," she answered; "I saw the storm approaching, and ran here before\r\nthe rain came down. What a time you have been!"\r\n\r\n"You expected me then?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! yes. I waited, waited----"\r\n\r\nThey had seated themselves on a pile of empty sacks, listening to\r\nthe pouring rain beating, with increased violence, on the roof. The\r\nlast train from Paris, which was just coming in, passed by, roaring,\r\nwhistling, rocking the ground. All at once Jacques rose. On seating\r\nhimself a few moments before, he had by chance found the handle of a\r\nhammer beneath his hand, and he was now deluged with intense joy. It\r\nwas all over then! He had not grasped that hammer and smashed the skull\r\nof his sweetheart. She was his own, without a battle, without that\r\ninstinctive craving to fling her lifeless on her back, like a prey torn\r\nfrom others.\r\n\r\nHe no longer thirsted to avenge those very ancient offences, whose\r\nexact details escaped his memory, that rancour stored up from male to\r\nmale since the first deceptions in the depths of caverns. No. This\r\ngirl had cured him, because he saw she was different from the others,\r\nviolent in her weakness, reeking with human gore, which encircled her\r\nin a sort of cuirass of horror. She predominated over him, he, who had\r\nnever dared do as she had done.\r\n\r\nS\xc3\xa9verine was also lost in reflections. Her heart had been pining after\r\nlove--absolute, constant love; and it was frightful cruelty that these\r\nrecent events should have cast her, haggard and anxious, into such\r\nabominations. Fate had dragged her in mire and blood with such violence\r\nthat her beautiful blue eyes, though still na\xc3\xafve, had preserved a look\r\nof terror-stricken expansion beneath her tragic crest of raven hair.\r\n\r\n"Oh! my darling, carry me off, keep me with you!" she exclaimed; "your\r\ndesires shall be mine."\r\n\r\n"No, no, my treasure," replied Jacques, who had again seated himself\r\nbeside her, "you are mistress. I am only here to love and obey you."\r\n\r\nThe hours passed. The rain had ceased some time. The station was\r\nplunged in absolute silence, troubled only by a distant and indistinct\r\nmoan rising from the sea. Suddenly a pistol-shot brought them to their\r\nfeet with a start. Day was about to break. A pale spot whitened the sky\r\nabove the mouth of the Seine. What could be the meaning of that shot?\r\nTheir imprudence, this folly of remaining together so late, made them,\r\nin swift imagination, picture to themselves the husband pursuing them\r\nwith a revolver.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t venture out!" exclaimed Jacques. "Wait! I\'ll go and see!"\r\n\r\nJacques had prudently advanced to the door, and there, in the dense\r\ndarkness that still prevailed, he could hear men advancing at the\r\ndouble. He recognised the voice of Roubaud, urging forward the\r\nwatchmen, shouting to them that the thieves were three in number, that\r\nhe had distinctly seen them stealing coal. For some weeks not a night\r\nhad passed without hallucinations of the same kind about imaginary\r\nbrigands. On this occasion, he had fired haphazard into the gloom.\r\n\r\n"Quick! quick!" exclaimed the young man; "let us be off! They will come\r\nand search this place. Run as fast as you can!"\r\n\r\nShe fell into his arms. They stifled one another, lips to lips. Then\r\nS\xc3\xa9verine tripped lightly through the dep\xc3\xb4t, protected by the high\r\nwall, while he quietly disappeared among the heaps of coal. And it was\r\nonly just time, for Roubaud, as he had foreseen, insisted on searching\r\nthe tool-house. He vowed the thieves must be there. The lanterns of\r\nthe watchmen danced on a level with the ground. There were words, and\r\nin the end they all turned back towards the station, irritated at\r\nthis fruitless chase; while Jacques, with his mind at ease, at last\r\ndetermined to make his way to the Rue Fran\xc3\xa7ois-Mazeline and go to bed.\r\n\r\nThe meetings between him and S\xc3\xa9verine continued throughout the\r\nsummer. Nor were they interrupted when the cold weather came at the\r\ncommencement of October. She arrived wrapped in an ample cloak, and, to\r\nbe screened from the frigid air outside, they barricaded themselves in\r\nthe tool-house by means of an iron bar that they had found there. In\r\nthis little retreat they were at home. The November hurricanes could\r\nroar, and tear the slates from the roofs, without inconveniencing them.\r\n\r\nJacques no longer had any doubt that he was cured of his frightful\r\nhereditary complaint, for since he had known S\xc3\xa9verine he had never been\r\ntroubled by thoughts of murder. Occasionally he suddenly remembered\r\nwhat she had done--that assassination, avowed by her eyes alone, on the\r\nbench in the Batignolles Square; but he had no inclination to learn the\r\ndetails. She, on the contrary, seemed more and more tormented by the\r\ndesire to reveal everything. At times he felt her bursting with her\r\nsecret; and, in anxiety, he would at once close her mouth with a kiss,\r\nsealing up the avowal. Why place this stranger between them? Could they\r\naffirm that it would not interfere with their happiness? He suspected\r\ndanger, and felt his old shiver return at the bare idea of raking up\r\nthis sanguinary story. And she, no doubt, guessed his thoughts.\r\n\r\nRoubaud, since the summer, had grown stouter, and in proportion as his\r\nwife recovered her gaiety and the bloom of her twenty years, he grew\r\nolder and seemed more overcast. In four months he had greatly changed,\r\nas she often said. He continued to cordially grasp the hand of Jacques,\r\ninviting him to the lodging, never happy but when he had him at his\r\ntable. Only this diversion no longer sufficed. He frequently took\r\nhimself off as soon as he had swallowed the last mouthful, sometimes\r\nleaving his comrade with his wife, pretending he was stifling, and\r\nrequired fresh air.\r\n\r\nThe truth was that he now frequented a small caf\xc3\xa9 on the Cours\r\nNapol\xc3\xa9on, where he met M. Cauche, the commissary of police attached\r\nto the station. He drank but little, merely a few small glasses of\r\nrum; but he had acquired a taste for gambling, which was turning to a\r\npassion. He only recovered energy, and forgot the past, when the cards\r\nwere in his hand, and he found himself engrossed in an interminable\r\nseries of games at piquet. M. Cauche, a frightful gambler, had\r\nsuggested having something on the game, and they had made the stake\r\nfive francs.\r\n\r\nFrom that moment, Roubaud, astonished not to have found himself out\r\nbefore, was burning with a thirst for gain, with that scorching fever\r\nbrought on by money won which ravages a man to the point of making him\r\nstake his position, even his life, on a throw of the dice. So far his\r\nwork had not suffered. He escaped as soon as free, returning home at\r\nthree or four o\'clock in the morning, on nights when he was off duty.\r\nHis wife never complained. She only reproached him with coming back\r\nmore sullen than before; for he was pursued by extraordinary bad luck,\r\nand ultimately got into debt.\r\n\r\nThe first quarrel broke out between S\xc3\xa9verine and Roubaud one evening.\r\nWithout hating him as yet, she had reached the point of enduring him\r\nwith difficulty, for she felt that he weighed on her existence. She\r\nwould have been so bright, so happy, had he not burdened her with\r\nhis presence. She experienced no remorse at deceiving him. Was it\r\nnot his own fault? Had he not almost thrust her to the brink of the\r\nprecipice? In the slow process of their disunion, to cure themselves\r\nof the uneasiness that upset them, both found consolation after their\r\nown hearts. As he had taken to gambling, she could very well have a\r\nsweetheart.\r\n\r\nBut what angered her more than anything, what she would not accept\r\nwithout revolt, was the inconvenience to which they were subjected by\r\nthe continual losses of her husband. Since the five-franc pieces of\r\nthe family flew to the caf\xc3\xa9 on the Cours Napol\xc3\xa9on, she at times did\r\nnot know how to pay her washerwoman, and was deprived of all sorts of\r\ndelicacies and little toilet comforts.\r\n\r\nOn this particular evening, it was about the purchase of a pair of\r\nboots which she really required, that they began quarrelling. He, on\r\nthe point of going out, not finding a knife on the table wherewith to\r\ncut himself a piece of bread, had taken the big knife, the weapon lying\r\nin a drawer of the sideboard. She kept her eyes on him while he refused\r\nthe fifteen francs for the boots, not having them, not knowing where to\r\nget them; and she obstinately repeated her demand, forcing him to renew\r\nhis refusal, which, little by little, took a tone of exasperation.\r\n\r\nAll at once she pointed out to him with her finger, the place in the\r\nparquetry where the spectres slumbered, telling him there was money\r\nthere, and that she wanted some. He turned very pale, and let go the\r\nknife, which fell into the drawer. At first she thought he was going to\r\nbeat her, for he approached her, stammering that the money there might\r\nrot, that he would sooner cut off his hand than touch it again. And\r\nwith fists clenched he threatened to knock her down if she dared, in\r\nhis absence, to raise the piece of parquetry and steal even a centime.\r\nNever! never! It was dead and buried.\r\n\r\nShe also had lost her colour, feeling faint at the idea of rummaging in\r\nthat place. No; let poverty come, both would die of hunger close by the\r\ntreasure. And, in fact, neither of them referred to the subject again,\r\neven on days when more than usually pinched. If they happened to place\r\na foot on the spot, they felt such a sharp burning pain that they ended\r\nby giving it a wide berth.\r\n\r\nThen, other disputes arose, in regard to La Croix-de-Maufras. Why did\r\nthey not sell the house? And they mutually accused one another of\r\nhaving done nothing that should have been done, to hasten the sale.\r\nHe always violently refused to attend to the matter, and on the rare\r\noccasions when S\xc3\xa9verine wrote to Misard on the subject, it was only to\r\nreceive vague replies: no inquiries had been made by anyone, the fruit\r\nhad come to nothing, the vegetables would not grow for want of water.\r\n\r\nLittle by little, the tranquillity that had settled upon the couple\r\nafter the crisis, became troubled in this manner, and seemed swept away\r\nin a terrible return of wrath. All the germs of unrest, the hidden\r\nmoney, the sweetheart introduced on the scene, had developed, parting\r\nthem and irritating one against the other. And, in this increasing\r\nagitation, life was about to become a pandemonium.\r\n\r\nAs if by a fatal counter-shock, everything was going wrong in the\r\nvicinity of the Roubauds. A fresh gust of tittle-tattle and discussions\r\nwhistled down the corridor. Philom\xc3\xa8ne had just violently broken off\r\nall connection with Madame Lebleu, in consequence of a calumny of\r\nthe latter, who accused the former of selling her a fowl that had\r\ndied of sickness. But the real reason of the rupture was the better\r\nunderstanding that prevailed between Philom\xc3\xa8ne and S\xc3\xa9verine. Pecqueux\r\nhaving one night met Madame Roubaud arm in arm with Jacques, S\xc3\xa9verine\r\nat once put aside her former scruples and made advances to the secret\r\nwife of the fireman; and Philom\xc3\xa8ne, very much flattered at this\r\nconnection with a lady, who without contestation was considered the\r\nadornment and distinction of the railway station, had just turned\r\nagainst the wife of the cashier, that old wretch, as she called her,\r\nwho was capable of setting mountains at variance.\r\n\r\nPhilom\xc3\xa8ne now declared that all the fault lay with Madame Lebleu,\r\ntelling everybody that the lodging looking on the street belonged to\r\nthe Roubauds, and that it was an abomination not to give it them.\r\nMatters, therefore, began to look very bad for Madame Lebleu, and the\r\nmore so, as her obstinacy in watching Mademoiselle Guichon, in order\r\nto surprise her with the station-master, threatened also to cause\r\nher serious trouble. She still failed to catch them, but she had the\r\nimprudence to get caught herself, her ear on the alert, stuck to the\r\nkeyhole. And M. Dabadie, exasperated at being spied upon in this\r\nmanner, had intimated to the assistant station-master, Moulin, that\r\nif Roubaud again claimed the lodging, he was ready to countersign the\r\nletter. Moulin, who, although as a rule, little given to gossip, having\r\nrepeated this remark, the lodgers had nearly come to blows, from door\r\nto door, all along the corridor, so high ran the excitement that had\r\nbeen thus revived.\r\n\r\nAmidst these disturbances, which became more and more frequent,\r\nS\xc3\xa9verine had but one quiet day in the week, the Friday. In October she\r\nhad placidly displayed the audacity to invent a pretext for frequently\r\nrunning up to Paris, the first that entered her head, a pain in the\r\nknee, which required the attention of a specialist. Each Friday, she\r\nleft by the 6.40 express in the morning, which was driven by Jacques,\r\nand after passing the day with him at the capital, returned by the 6.30\r\nexpress in the evening.\r\n\r\nAt first, she had thought it only right to give her husband news of her\r\nknee: it was better, it was worse, and so forth. Then, perceiving he\r\nturned a deaf ear to what she said, she had coolly ceased speaking to\r\nhim on the subject. But ever and anon she would cast her eyes on him,\r\nwondering whether he knew. How was it that this ferociously jealous\r\nman, who, blinded by blood, had killed a fellow being in an idiotic\r\nrage, how was it that he had reached the point of permitting her to\r\nhave a sweetheart? She could not believe it, she simply thought he must\r\nbe getting stupid.\r\n\r\nOne icy cold night in December, S\xc3\xa9verine was sitting up very late for\r\nher husband. The next morning, a Friday, she was to take the express\r\nbefore daybreak; and on such evenings as these, she had the habit of\r\ngetting a very nice gown ready, and preparing her other garments, so as\r\nto be rapidly dressed, immediately she jumped out of bed.\r\n\r\nAt last, she retired to rest, and ended by falling off to sleep about\r\none o\'clock. Roubaud had not returned home. Already, on two occasions,\r\nhe had only made his appearance at early dawn, his increasing passion\r\nfor play being such that he could not tear himself away from the caf\xc3\xa9,\r\nwhere a small room at the back was gradually being transformed into a\r\ngambling hell. They now played for high stakes at \xc3\xa9cart\xc3\xa9.\r\n\r\nHappy to be alone, in a pleasant frame of mind at the prospect of\r\na delightful day on the morrow, the young woman slumbered soundly,\r\nin the gentle warmth of the bedclothes. But, as three o\'clock was\r\nabout to strike, she was awakened by a singular noise. First of all\r\nshe did not understand, she fancied she must be dreaming and went to\r\nsleep again. Then came a dull sound, as of someone pushing against\r\nsomething, followed by cracking of wood, as if somebody was trying to\r\nforce open a door. A sharp rent, more violent than the other sounds,\r\nbrought her to a sitting posture in bed. She was frightened to death;\r\nsomeone was certainly trying to burst the lock in the corridor. For a\r\nminute or two she dared not move, but listened with drumming ears. Then\r\nshe had the courage to get up, and look. She walked noiselessly across\r\nthe room with bare feet, and gently set the door ajar, so chilled with\r\ncold that she turned quite pale, and the sight that met her eyes in the\r\ndining-room, riveted her to the spot in surprise and horror.\r\n\r\nRoubaud, grovelling on the ground, raising himself on his elbows, had\r\njust torn away the dreaded piece of parquetry with the assistance of\r\na chisel. A candle, set down beside him, afforded light while casting\r\nhis enormous shadow on the ceiling. And at that moment, with his face\r\nbent over the hole which cut the parquetry with a black slit, he was\r\npeering with dilated eyes within. His cheeks were flushed, and he wore\r\nhis assassin-like expression. Brutally he plunged his hand into the\r\naperture, and, in his trembling agitation, finding nothing, he had to\r\nbring the candle nearer. Then at the bottom of the hole appeared the\r\npurse, notes, and watch.\r\n\r\nS\xc3\xa9verine uttered an involuntary cry, and Roubaud turned round,\r\nterrified. At first he failed to recognise her, and seeing her there,\r\nall in white, with a look of horror on her countenance, no doubt took\r\nher for a spectre.\r\n\r\n"What are you doing there?" she demanded.\r\n\r\nThen, understanding, avoiding to answer, he only gave a sullen growl.\r\nBut he still looked at her, inconvenienced by her presence, wishing to\r\nsend her back to bed. And not a reasonable word came to his lips. He\r\nsimply felt inclined to box her ears, as she stood there shivering in\r\nher night-dress.\r\n\r\n"So," she continued, "you refuse me a pair of boots, and you take the\r\nmoney for yourself because you have lost."\r\n\r\nThis remark at once enraged him. Was she going to spoil his life again,\r\nto set herself in front of his pleasures--this woman whom he no longer\r\ncared for? Again he rummaged in the hole, but only took from it the\r\npurse containing the 300 frcs. in gold. And when he had fixed the piece\r\nof parquetry in its place with his heel, he went and flung these words\r\nin her face, through his set teeth:\r\n\r\n"Go to the deuce! I shall act as I choose. Am I asking you what you are\r\ngoing to do, by-and-by, at Paris?"\r\n\r\nThen, with a furious shrug of the shoulders, he returned to the caf\xc3\xa9,\r\nleaving the candle on the floor.\r\n\r\nS\xc3\xa9verine picked it up, and went back to bed, cold as ice. But, unable\r\nto get to sleep again, she kept the candle alight, waiting, with her\r\neyes wide open, until the time came for the departure of the express,\r\nand gradually growing burning hot. It was now certain that there had\r\nbeen a progressive disorganisation, like an infiltration of the crime,\r\nwhich was decomposing this man, and which had worn out every bond\r\nbetween them. Roubaud knew.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\nOn that particular Friday, the travellers who were to take the 6.40\r\nexpress from Havre, awoke with an exclamation of surprise; snow had\r\nbeen falling since midnight, so thickly and in such large flakes, that\r\nthe streets were a foot deep in it.\r\n\r\nLa Lison, attached to a train of seven carriages, three second and four\r\nfirst class, was already puffing and smoking under the span roof. When\r\nJacques and Pecqueux arrived at the dep\xc3\xb4t at about half-past five to\r\nget the engine ready, they uttered a growl of anxiety at the sight of\r\nthis persistent snow rending the black sky. And now, at their post,\r\nthey awaited the sound of the whistle, with eyes gazing far ahead\r\nbeyond the gaping porch of the marquee, watching the silent, endless\r\nfall of flakes draping the obscurity in livid hue.\r\n\r\nThe driver murmured:\r\n\r\n"The devil take me if you can see a signal!"\r\n\r\n"We may think ourselves lucky if we can get along," said the fireman.\r\n\r\nRoubaud was on the platform with his lantern, having returned at the\r\nprecise minute to resume his service. At moments his heavy eyelids\r\nclosed with fatigue, without him ceasing his supervision. Jacques\r\nhaving inquired whether he knew anything as to the state of the line,\r\nhe had just approached and pressed his hand, answering that as yet he\r\nhad received no telegram; and as S\xc3\xa9verine came down, wrapped in an\r\nample cloak, he led her to a first class compartment and assisted her\r\nin. No doubt he caught sight of the anxious look of tenderness that the\r\ntwo sweethearts exchanged; but he did not even trouble to tell his\r\nwife that it was imprudent to set out in such weather, and that she\r\nwould do better to postpone her journey.\r\n\r\nPassengers arrived, muffled up, loaded with travelling-bags, and there\r\nwas quite a crush in the terrible morning cold. The snow did not even\r\nmelt on the shoes of the travellers. The carriage doors were closed\r\nas soon as the people were in the compartments where they barricaded\r\nthemselves; and the platform, badly lit by the uncertain glimmer of a\r\nfew gas-burners, became deserted. The light of the locomotive, attached\r\nto the base of the chimney, alone burnt brightly like a huge eye\r\ndilating its sheet of fire far into the obscurity.\r\n\r\nRoubaud raised his lantern to give the signal of departure. The\r\nheadguard blew his whistle, and Jacques answered, after opening the\r\nregulator and revolving the reversing-wheel. They started. For a\r\nminute the assistant station-master tranquilly gazed after the train\r\ndisappearing in the tempest.\r\n\r\n"Attention!" said Jacques to Pecqueux. "No joking to-day!"\r\n\r\nHe had not failed to remark that his companion seemed also worn out\r\nwith fatigue. Assuredly the consequence of some spree on the previous\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n"Oh! no fear, no fear!" stammered the fireman.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they left the span roofing of the station, they were in the\r\nsnow. The wind, blowing from the east, caught the locomotive in front,\r\nbeating against it in violent gusts. The two men in the cab did not\r\nsuffer much at first, clothed as they were in thick woollen garments,\r\nwith their eyes protected by spectacles. But the light on the engine,\r\nusually so brilliant at night, seemed swallowed up in the thick fall of\r\nsnow. Instead of the metal way being illuminated three or four hundred\r\nyards ahead, it came into evidence in a sort of milky fog. The various\r\nobjects could only be distinguished when the locomotive was quite close\r\nto them, and then they appeared indistinct, as in a dream.\r\n\r\nThe anxiety of the driver was complete when he recognised, on reaching\r\nthe first signal-post, that he would certainly be unable, as he had\r\nfeared, to see the red lights barring the lines at the regulation\r\ndistances. From that moment he advanced with extreme prudence, but\r\nwithout it being possible for him to slacken speed, for the wind\r\noffered extraordinary resistance, and delay would have been as\r\ndangerous as a too rapid advance.\r\n\r\nAs far as Harfleur, La Lison went along at a good and well-sustained\r\npace. The layer of snow that had fallen did not as yet trouble Jacques,\r\nfor, at the most, there were two feet on the line, and the snow-blade\r\ncould easily clear away four. All his anxiety was to maintain the\r\nspeed, well aware that the real merit of a driver, after temperance,\r\nand esteem for his engine, consisted in advancing in an uniform way,\r\nwithout jolting, and at the highest pressure possible.\r\n\r\nIndeed, his only defect lay in his obstinacy not to stop. He disobeyed\r\nthe signals, always thinking he would have time to master La Lison;\r\nand so he now and again over-shot the mark, crushing the crackers,\r\nthe "corns" as they are termed, and, on two occasions, this habit had\r\ncaused him to be suspended for a week. But now, in the great danger in\r\nwhich he felt himself, the thought that S\xc3\xa9verine was there, that he\r\nwas entrusted with her dear life, increased his strength of character\r\ntenfold; and he maintained his determination to be cautious all the way\r\nto Paris, all along that double metal line, bristling with obstacles\r\nthat he must overcome.\r\n\r\nStanding on the sheet of iron connecting the engine with the tender,\r\ncontinually jolted by their oscillation, Jacques, notwithstanding the\r\nsnow, leant over the side, on the right, to get a better view. For he\r\ncould distinguish nothing through the cab window clouded with water;\r\nand he remained with his face exposed to the gusts of wind, his skin\r\npricked as with thousands of needles, and so pinched with cold that it\r\nseemed like being slashed with razors. Ever and anon he withdrew to\r\ntake breath; he removed his spectacles and wiped them; then he resumed\r\nhis former position facing the hurricane, his eyes fixed, in the\r\nexpectation of seeing red lights; and so absorbed was he in his anxiety\r\nto find them, that on two occasions he fell a prey to the hallucination\r\nthat crimson sparks were boring the white curtain of snow fluttering\r\nbefore him.\r\n\r\nBut, on a sudden, in the darkness, he felt a presentiment that\r\nhis fireman was no longer there. Only a small lantern lit up\r\nthe steam-gauge, so that the eyes of the driver might not be\r\ninconvenienced; and, on the enamelled face of the manometer, which\r\npreserved its clear lustre, he noticed the trembling blue hand rapidly\r\nretreating. The fire was going down. The fireman had just stretched\r\nhimself on the chest, vanquished by fatigue.\r\n\r\n"Infernal rake!" exclaimed Jacques, shaking him in a rage.\r\n\r\nPecqueux rose, excusing himself in an unintelligible growl. He could\r\nhardly stand; but, by force of habit, he at once went to his fire,\r\nhammer in hand, breaking the coal, spreading it evenly on the bars with\r\nthe shovel. Then he swept up with the broom. And while the door of the\r\nfire-box remained open, a reflex from the furnace, like the flaming\r\ntail of a comet extending to the rear of the train, had set fire to the\r\nsnow which fell across it in great golden drops.\r\n\r\nAfter Harfleur began the big ascent, ten miles long, which extends to\r\nSaint-Romain--the steepest on the line. And the driver stood to the\r\nengine, full of attention, anticipating that La Lison would have to\r\nmake a famous effort to ascend this hill, already hard to climb in\r\nfine weather. With his hand on the reversing-wheel, he watched the\r\ntelegraph poles fly by, endeavouring to form an idea of the speed.\r\nThis decreased considerably. La Lison was puffing, while the scraping\r\nof the snow-blade indicated growing resistance. He opened the door\r\nof the fire-box with the toe of his boot. The fireman, half asleep,\r\nunderstood, and added more fuel to the embers, so as to increase the\r\npressure.\r\n\r\nThe door was now becoming red-hot, lighting up the legs of both of\r\nthem with a violet gleam. But neither felt the scorching heat in the\r\ncurrent of icy air that enveloped them. The fireman, at a sign from\r\nhis chief, had just raised the rod of the ash-pan which added to the\r\ndraught. The hand of the manometer at present marked ten atmospheres,\r\nand La Lison was exerting all the power it possessed. At one moment,\r\nperceiving the water in the steam-gauge sink, the driver had to turn\r\nthe injection-cock, although by doing so he diminished the pressure.\r\nNevertheless, it rose again, the engine snorted and spat like an animal\r\nover-ridden, making jumps and efforts fit to convey the idea that it\r\nwould suddenly crack some of its component pieces. And he treated La\r\nLison roughly, like a woman who has grown old and lost her strength,\r\nceasing to feel the same tenderness for it as formerly.\r\n\r\n"The lazy thing will never get to the top," said he between his set\r\nteeth--he who never uttered a word on the journey.\r\n\r\nPecqueux, in his drowsiness, looked at him in astonishment. What had\r\nhe got now against La Lison? Was it not still the same brave, obedient\r\nlocomotive, starting so readily that it was a pleasure to set it in\r\nmotion; and gifted with such excellent vaporisation that it economised\r\na tenth part of its coal between Paris and Havre? When an engine had\r\nslide valves like this one, so perfectly regulated, cutting the steam\r\nso miraculously, they could overlook all imperfections, as in the case\r\nof a capricious, but steady and economical housewife. No doubt La Lison\r\ntook too much grease, but what of that? They would grease it, and there\r\nwas an end of the matter.\r\n\r\nJust at that moment, Jacques, in exasperation, repeated:\r\n\r\n"It\'ll never reach the top, unless it\'s greased!"\r\n\r\nAnd he did what he had not done thrice in his life. He took the oil-can\r\nto grease the engine as it went along. Climbing over the rail, he got\r\non the frame-plate beside the boiler, which he followed to the end.\r\nIt was a most perilous undertaking. His feet slipped on the narrow\r\nstrip of iron, wet with snow. He was blinded, and the terrible wind\r\nthreatened to sweep him away like a straw.\r\n\r\nLa Lison, with this man clinging to its side, continued its panting\r\ncourse in the darkness, cutting for itself a deep trench in the immense\r\nwhite sheet covering the ground. The engine shook him, but bore him\r\nalong. On attaining the cross-piece in front, he held on to the rail\r\nwith one hand, and, stooping down before the oil-box of the cylinder on\r\nthe right, experienced the greatest difficulty in filling it. Then he\r\nhad to go round to the other side, like a crawling insect, to grease\r\nthe cylinder on the left. And when he got back to his post, he was\r\nexhausted and deadly pale, having felt himself face to face with death.\r\n\r\n"Vile brute!" he murmured.\r\n\r\nPecqueux had recovered, in a measure, from his drowsiness, and pulled\r\nhimself together. He, too, was at his post, watching the line on the\r\nleft. On ordinary occasions he had good eyes, better than those of his\r\nchief, but in this storm everything had disappeared. They, to whom\r\neach mile of the metal way was so familiar, could barely recognise the\r\nplaces they passed. The line had disappeared in the snow, the hedges,\r\nthe houses, even, seemed about to follow suit. Around them was naught\r\nbut a deserted and boundless expanse, where La Lison seemed to be\r\ncareering at will, in a fit of madness.\r\n\r\nNever had these two men felt so keenly the fraternal bond uniting them\r\nas on this advancing engine, let loose amidst all kinds of danger,\r\nwhere they were more alone, more abandoned by the world, than if locked\r\nup in a room by themselves; and where, moreover, they had the grievous,\r\nthe crushing responsibility of the human lives they were dragging\r\nafter them.\r\n\r\nThe snow continued falling thicker than ever. They were still\r\nascending, when the fireman, in his turn, fancied he perceived the\r\nglint of a red light in the distance and told his chief. But already he\r\nhad lost it. His eyes must have been dreaming, as he sometimes said.\r\nAnd the driver, who had seen nothing, remained with a beating heart,\r\ntroubled at this hallucination of another, and losing confidence in\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nWhat he imagined he distinguished beyond the myriads of pale flakes\r\nwere immense black forms, enormous masses, like gigantic pieces of the\r\nnight, which seemed to displace themselves and come before the engine.\r\nCould these be landslips, mountains barring the line against which\r\nthe train was about to crush? Then, affrighted, he pulled the rod of\r\nthe whistle, and whistled long, despairingly; and this lamentation\r\nwent slowly and lugubriously through the storm. Then he was astonished\r\nto find that he had whistled at the right moment, for the train was\r\npassing the station of Saint-Romain at express speed, and he had\r\nthought it two miles away.\r\n\r\nLa Lison, having got over the terrible ascent, began rolling on more at\r\nease, and Jacques had time to breathe. Between Saint-Romain and Bolbec\r\nthe line makes an imperceptible rise, so that all would, no doubt, be\r\nwell until the other side of the plateau. While he was at Beuzeville,\r\nduring the three minutes\' stoppage, he nevertheless called the\r\nstation-master, whom he perceived on the platform, wishing to convey\r\nto him his anxiety about this snow, which continued getting deeper and\r\ndeeper: he would never be able to reach Rouen; the best thing would be\r\nto put on another engine, while he was at a dep\xc3\xb4t, where locomotives\r\nwere always ready. But the station-master answered that he had no\r\norders, and that he did not feel disposed to take the responsibility of\r\nsuch a measure on himself. All he offered to do was to give five or\r\nsix wooden shovels to clear the line in case of need; and Pecqueux took\r\nthe shovels, which he placed in a corner of the tender.\r\n\r\nOn the plateau, La Lison, as Jacques had foreseen, continued to advance\r\nat a good speed, and without too much trouble. Nevertheless, it tired.\r\nAt every minute the driver had to make a sign and open the fire-box,\r\nso that the fireman might put on coal. And each time he did so, above\r\nthe mournful train, standing out in black upon all this whiteness and\r\ncovered with a winding sheet of snow, flamed the dazzling tail of the\r\ncomet, boring into the night.\r\n\r\nAt three-quarters of an hour past seven, day was breaking; but the\r\nwan dawn could hardly be discerned in the immense whitish whirlwind\r\nfilling space within the entire horizon. This uncertain light, by which\r\nnothing could as yet be distinguished, increased the anxiety of the two\r\nmen, who, with eyes watering, notwithstanding their spectacles, did\r\ntheir utmost to pierce the distance. The driver, without letting go\r\nthe reversing-wheel never quitted the rod of the whistle. He sounded\r\nit almost continuously, by prudence, giving a shriek of distress that\r\npenetrated like a wail to the depths of this desert of snow.\r\n\r\nThey passed Bolbec, and then Yvetot, without difficulty. But at\r\nMotteville, Jacques made inquiries of the assistant station-master\r\nfor precise information as to the state of the line. No train had yet\r\narrived, and a telegram that had been received merely stated that the\r\nslow train from Paris was blocked at Rouen in safety. And La Lison went\r\non again, descending at her heavy and weary gait the ten miles or so of\r\ngentle slope to Barentin.\r\n\r\nDaylight now began to appear, but very dimly; and it seemed as if\r\nthis livid glimmer came from the snow itself which fell more densely,\r\nconfused and cold, overwhelming the earth with the refuse of the sky.\r\nAs day grew, the violence of the wind redoubled, and the snowflakes\r\nwere driven along in balls. At every moment the fireman had to take\r\nhis shovel to clear the coal at the back of the tender between the\r\npartitions of the water-tank.\r\n\r\nThe country, to right and left, so absolutely defied recognition,\r\nthat the two men felt as if they were being borne along in a dream.\r\nThe vast flat fields, the rich pastures enclosed in green hedges, the\r\napple orchards were naught but a white sea, barely swelling with choppy\r\nwaves, a pallid, quivering expanse where everything became white.\r\nAnd the driver erect, with his hand on the reversing-wheel, his face\r\nlacerated by the gusts of wind, began to suffer terribly from cold.\r\n\r\nWhen the train stopped at Barentin, M. Bessi\xc3\xa8re, the station-master,\r\nhimself approached the engine, to warn Jacques that a considerable\r\naccumulation of snow had been signalled in the vicinity of La\r\nCroix-de-Maufras.\r\n\r\n"I believe it is still possible to pass," he added; "but it will not be\r\nwithout difficulty."\r\n\r\nThereupon, the young man flew into a passion, and with an oath\r\nexclaimed:\r\n\r\n"I said as much at Beuzeville! Why couldn\'t they put on a second\r\nlocomotive? We shall be in a nice mess now!"\r\n\r\nThe headguard had just left his van, and he became angry as well. He\r\nwas frozen in his box, and declared that he could not distinguish a\r\nsignal from a telegraph pole. It was a regular groping journey in all\r\nthis white.\r\n\r\n"Anyhow, you are warned," said M. Bessi\xc3\xa8re.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the passengers were astonished at this prolonged\r\nstoppage, amid the complete silence enveloping the station, without a\r\nshout from any of the staff, or the banging of a door. A few windows\r\nwere lowered, and heads appeared: a very stout lady with a couple of\r\ncharming, fair young girls, no doubt her daughters, all three English\r\nfor certain; and, further on, a very pretty dark, young woman, who was\r\nmade to draw in her head by an elderly gentleman; while two men, one\r\nyoung and the other old, chatted from one carriage to the other, with\r\ntheir bodies half out of the windows.\r\n\r\nBut as Jacques cast a glance behind him, he perceived only S\xc3\xa9verine,\r\nwho was also looking out and gazing anxiously in his direction. Ah!\r\nthe dear creature, how uneasy she must be, and what a heartburn he\r\nexperienced knowing her there, so near and yet so far away in all this\r\ndanger!\r\n\r\n"Come! Be off!" concluded the station-master. "It is no use frightening\r\nthe people."\r\n\r\nHe gave the signal himself. The headguard, who had got into his van,\r\nwhistled; and once more La Lison went off, after answering with a long\r\nwail of complaint.\r\n\r\nJacques at once felt that the state of the line had changed. It was\r\nno longer the plain, the eternal unfolding of the thick sheet of\r\nsnow, through which the engine ran along, like a steam-boat, leaving\r\na trail behind her. They were entering the uneven country of hills\r\nand dales, whose enormous undulation extended as far as Malaunay,\r\nbreaking up the ground into heaps; and here the snow had collected in\r\nan unequal manner. In places the line proved free, while in others it\r\nwas blocked by drifts of considerable magnitude. The wind that swept\r\nthe embankments filled up the cuttings; and thus there was a continual\r\nsuccession of obstacles to be overcome: bits of clear line blocked\r\nby absolute ramparts. It was now broad daylight, and the devastated\r\ncountry, those narrow gorges, those steep slopes, resembled in their\r\nwhite coating, the desolation of an ocean of ice remaining motionless\r\nin the storm.\r\n\r\nNever had Jacques felt so penetrated by the cold. His face seemed\r\nbleeding from the stinging flagellation of the snow; and he had lost\r\nconsciousness of his hands, which were so benumbed and so bereft of\r\nsensibility, that he shuddered on perceiving he could not feel the\r\ntouch of the reversing-wheel. When he raised his elbow to pull the rod\r\nof the whistle, his arm weighed on the shoulder as if dead. He could\r\nnot have affirmed that his legs still carried him, amid the constant\r\nshocks of oscillation that tore his inside. Great fatigue had gained\r\nhim, along with the cold, whose icy chill was attaining his head. He\r\nbegan to doubt whether he existed, whether he was still driving, for he\r\nalready only turned the wheel in a mechanical way; and, half silly, he\r\nwatched the manometer going back.\r\n\r\nAll kinds of hallucinations passed through his head. Was not that a\r\nfelled tree, over there, lying across the line? Had he not caught\r\nsight of a red flag flying above that hedge? Were not crackers going\r\noff every minute amidst the clatter of the wheels? He could not have\r\nanswered. He repeated to himself that he ought to stop, and he lacked\r\nthe firmness of will to do so. This crisis tortured him for a few\r\nminutes; then, abruptly, the sight of Pecqueux, who had fallen asleep\r\nagain on the chest, overcome by the cold from which he was suffering\r\nhimself, threw him into such a frightful rage that it seemed to bring\r\nhim warmth.\r\n\r\n"Ah! the abominable brute!" he exclaimed.\r\n\r\nAnd he, who was usually so lenient for the vices of this drunkard,\r\nkicked him until he awoke, and was on his feet. Pecqueux, benumbed with\r\ncold, grumbled as he grasped the shovel:\r\n\r\n"That\'ll do, that\'ll do; I\'m going there!"\r\n\r\nWith the fire made up, the pressure rose; and it was time, for La Lison\r\nhad just entered a cutting where it had to cleave through four feet of\r\nsnow. It advanced with an energetic effort, vibrating in every part.\r\nFor an instant it showed signs of exhaustion, and seemed as if about to\r\nstand still, like a vessel that has touched a sandbank. What increased\r\nthe weight it had to draw was the snow, which had accumulated in a\r\nheavy layer on the roofs of the carriages.\r\n\r\nThey continued thus, seaming the whiteness with a dark line, with this\r\nwhite sheet spread over them; while the engine itself had only borders\r\nof ermine draping its sombre sides, where the snowflakes melted to\r\nrun off in rain. Once more it extricated itself, notwithstanding the\r\nweight, and passed on. At the top of an embankment, that made a great\r\ncurve, the train could still be seen advancing without difficulty, like\r\na strip of shadow lost in some fairyland sparkling with whiteness.\r\n\r\nBut, farther on, the cuttings began again; and Jacques and Pecqueux,\r\nwho had felt La Lison touch, stiffened themselves against the cold,\r\nerect at their posts, which even, were they dying, they could not\r\ndesert. Once more the engine lost speed; it had got between two talus,\r\nand the stoppage came slowly and without a shock. It seemed as if glued\r\nthere, exhausted; as though all its wheels were clogged, tighter and\r\ntighter. It ceased moving, the end had come; the snow held the engine\r\npowerless.\r\n\r\n"It\'s all up!" growled Jacques with an oath.\r\n\r\nHe remained a few seconds longer at his post, his hand on the wheel,\r\nopening everything to see if the obstacle would yield. Then, hearing La\r\nLison spitting and snorting in vain, he shut the regulator, and, in his\r\nfury, swore worse than ever.\r\n\r\nThe headguard leant out from the door of his van, and Pecqueux, turning\r\nround, shouted to him:\r\n\r\n"It\'s all up! We\'re stuck!"\r\n\r\nBriskly the guard sprang into the snow, which reached to his knees. He\r\napproached, and the three men consulted together.\r\n\r\n"The only thing we can do is to try and dig it out," said the driver\r\nat last. "Fortunately, we have some shovels. Call the second guard at\r\nthe end of the train, and between us four we shall be able to clear the\r\nwheels."\r\n\r\nThey gave a sign to the other guard behind, who had also left his van.\r\nHe made his way to them with great difficulty, getting at times half\r\nburied in the snow.\r\n\r\nBut this stoppage in the open country, amid this pallid solitude,\r\nthis clear sound of voices discussing what must be done, the guard\r\nfloundering along beside the train with laborious strides had made the\r\npassengers uneasy. The windows went down; the people called out and\r\nquestioned one another; a regular confusion ensued--vague, as yet, but\r\nbecoming more pronounced.\r\n\r\n"Where are we? Why have they stopped? What is the matter? Good heavens!\r\nis there an accident?"\r\n\r\nThe guard found it necessary to allay the alarm; and just as he\r\nadvanced to the carriages, the English lady, whose fat red face was\r\nflanked by the charming countenances of her daughters, inquired with a\r\nstrong accent:\r\n\r\n"Guard, is there any danger?"\r\n\r\n"No, no, madam," he replied. "It\'s only a little snow. We shall be\r\ngoing on at once."\r\n\r\nAnd the window went up again amid the bright twittering of the young\r\ngirls--that music of English syllables which is so sparkling on rosy\r\nlips. Both were laughing, very much amused.\r\n\r\nBut the elderly gentleman, who was farther on, also called the guard,\r\nwhile his young wife risked her pretty dark head behind him.\r\n\r\n"How was it that no precautions were taken? It is unbearable. I am\r\nreturning from London. My business requires my presence in Paris this\r\nmorning, and I warn you that I shall make the company responsible for\r\nany delay."\r\n\r\n"We shall be going on again in three minutes, sir," said the guard.\r\n\r\nThe cold was terrible; the snow entered the carriages, driving in the\r\nheads and bringing up the windows. But the agitation continued within\r\nthe closed vehicles, where everyone was disturbed by a low hum of\r\nanxiety. A couple of windows alone remained down; and two travellers\r\nleaning out, three compartments away from each other, were talking.\r\nOne was an American some forty years of age, and the other a young\r\ngentleman from Havre. Both were very much interested in the task of\r\nclearing away the snow.\r\n\r\n"In America everyone would get down and take a shovel," remarked the\r\nformer.\r\n\r\n"Oh! it is nothing!" answered the other. "I was blocked twice last\r\nyear. My business brings me to Paris every week."\r\n\r\n"And mine every three weeks, or so."\r\n\r\n"What! from New York?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; from New York."\r\n\r\nIt was Jacques who directed the labour. Perceiving S\xc3\xa9verine at the door\r\nof the first carriage, where she always took her seat, so as to be\r\nnear him, he gave her a look of entreaty; and she, understanding, drew\r\nback out of the icy wind that was stinging her face. Then, with her\r\noccupying his thoughts, he worked away heartily.\r\n\r\nBut he remarked that the cause of the stoppage, the embedment in the\r\nsnow had nothing to do with the wheels, which cut through the deepest\r\ndrifts. It was the ash-pan, placed between them, that produced the\r\nobstruction, by driving the snow along, compressing it into enormous\r\nlumps. And he was struck with an idea.\r\n\r\n"We must unscrew the ash-pan," said he.\r\n\r\nAt first the headguard opposed the suggestion. The driver was under his\r\norders, and he would not give his consent to the engine being touched.\r\nThen, giving way to argument, he said:\r\n\r\n"If you take the responsibility, all right!"\r\n\r\nOnly it was a hard job. Stretched out beneath the engine, with their\r\nbacks in the melting snow, Jacques and Pecqueux had to toil for nearly\r\nhalf an hour. Fortunately they had spare screwdrivers in the toolchest.\r\nAt last, at the risk of burning themselves and getting crushed a score\r\nof times over, they managed to take the ash-pan down. But they had not\r\ndone with it yet. It was necessary to drag it away. Being an enormous\r\nweight, it got jammed in the wheels and cylinders. Nevertheless, the\r\nfour together were able to pull it out, and drag it off the line to the\r\nfoot of the embankment.\r\n\r\n"Now let us finish clearing away the snow," said the guard.\r\n\r\nThe train had been close upon an hour in distress, and the alarm of the\r\npassengers had increased. Every minute a glass went down, and a voice\r\ninquired why they did not go on. There was a regular panic, with shouts\r\nand tears, in an increscent crisis of craziness.\r\n\r\n"No, no, enough has been cleared away," said Jacques. "Jump up, I\'ll\r\nsee to the rest."\r\n\r\nHe was once more at his post, along with Pecqueux, and when the two\r\nguards had gained their vans, he turned on the exhaust-tap. The\r\ndeafening rush of scalding steam melted the remainder of the snow still\r\nclinging to the line. Then, with his hand on the wheel, he reversed\r\nthe engine, and slowly retreated to a distance of about four hundred\r\nyards, to give it a run. And having piled up the fire, and attained a\r\npressure exceeding what was permitted by the regulations, he sent La\r\nLison against the wall of snow with all its might and all the weight of\r\nthe train it drew.\r\n\r\nThe locomotive gave a terrific grunt, similar to that of a woodman\r\ndriving his axe into a great tree, and it seemed as though all the\r\npowerful ironwork was about to crack. It could not pass yet. It came to\r\na standstill, smoking and vibrating all over with the shock. Twice the\r\ndriver had to repeat the man\xc5\x93uvre, running back, then dashing against\r\nthe snow to drive it away. On each occasion, La Lison, girded for the\r\nencounter, struck its chest against the impediment with the furious\r\nrespiration of a giant, but to no purpose. At last, regaining breath,\r\nit strained its metal muscles in a supreme effort and passed, while the\r\ntrain followed ponderously behind, between the two walls of snow ripped\r\nasunder. It was free!\r\n\r\n"A good brute, all the same!" growled Pecqueux.\r\n\r\nJacques, half blinded, removed his spectacles and wiped them. His\r\nheart beat hard. He no longer felt the cold. But abruptly he remembered\r\na deep cutting, some four hundred yards away from La Croix-de-Maufras.\r\nIt opened in the direction of the wind, and the snow must have\r\naccumulated there in a considerable quantity. He at once felt certain\r\nthat this was the rock, marked out, whereon he would founder. He bent\r\nforward. In the distance, after a final curve, the trench appeared\r\nbefore him in a straight line, like a long ditch full of snow. It was\r\nbroad daylight, and the boundless whiteness sparkled amid the unceasing\r\nfall of snowflakes.\r\n\r\nLa Lison skimmed along at a medium speed, having encountered no further\r\nobstacle. By precaution, the lanterns had been left burning in front\r\nand behind; and the white light at the base of the chimney shone in\r\nthe daylight like a living Cyclopean eye. The engine rolled along,\r\napproaching the cutting, with this eye wide open. Then it seemed to\r\npant, with the gentle short respiration of an affrighted steed. It\r\nshook with deep thrills, it reared, and was only impelled forward under\r\nthe vigorous hand of the driver. The latter had rapidly opened the door\r\nof the fire-box for the fireman to put in coal. And now it was no more\r\nthe tail of a comet illuminating the night, it was a plume of thick\r\nblack smoke, soiling the great shivering pallidness of the sky.\r\n\r\nLa Lison advanced. At last it had to enter the cutting. The slopes, to\r\nright and left, were deep in snow; and at the bottom not a vestige of\r\nthe line could be seen. It was like the bed of a torrent filled up with\r\nsnow from side to side. The locomotive passed in, rolling along for\r\nsixty or seventy yards, with exhausted respiration that grew shorter\r\nand shorter. The snow it pushed forward formed a barrier in front,\r\nwhich flew about and rose like an ungovernable flood threatening to\r\nengulf it. For a moment it appeared overwhelmed and vanquished. But,\r\nin a final effort, it delivered itself to advance another forty yards.\r\nThat was the end, the last pang of death. Lumps of snow fell down\r\ncovering the wheels; all the pieces of the mechanism were smothered,\r\nconnected with one another by chains of ice. And La Lison stopped\r\ndefinitely, expiring in the intense cold. Its respiration died away, it\r\nwas motionless and dead.\r\n\r\n"There, we\'re done for now," said Jacques. "That is just what I\r\nexpected."\r\n\r\nHe at once wanted to reverse the engine, to try the previous man\xc5\x93uvre\r\nagain. But, this time, La Lison did not move. It refused either to go\r\nback or advance, it was blocked everywhere, riveted to the ground,\r\ninert and insensible. Behind, the train, buried in a thick bed reaching\r\nto the doors, also seemed dead. The snow, far from ceasing, fell more\r\ndensely than before in prolonged squalls. They were in a drift, where\r\nengine and carriages, already half covered up, would soon disappear\r\namid the shivering silence of this hoary solitude. Nothing more moved.\r\nThe snow was weaving the winding sheet.\r\n\r\n"What!" exclaimed the chiefguard, leaning out of his van; "has it begun\r\nagain?"\r\n\r\n"We\'re done for!" Pecqueux simply shouted.\r\n\r\nThis time, indeed, the position proved critical. The guard in the rear\r\nran and placed fog-signals on the line, to protect the train at the\r\nback; while the driver sounded distractedly, with swift breaks, the\r\npanting, lugubrious whistle of distress. But the snow loading the air,\r\nthe sound was lost, and could not even have reached Barentin. What\r\nwas to be done? They were but four, and they would never be able to\r\nclear away such an immense mass--a regular gang of labourers would be\r\nnecessary. It became imperative to run for assistance. And the worst of\r\nit was that the passengers were again in a panic.\r\n\r\nA door opened. The pretty dark lady sprang from her carriage in a\r\nfright, thinking they had met with an accident. Her husband, the\r\nelderly commercial man, followed, exclaiming:\r\n\r\n"I shall write to the Minister. It\'s an outrage!"\r\n\r\nThen came the tears of the women, the furious voices of the men, as\r\nthey jumped from their compartments, amid the violent shocks of the\r\nlowered windows. The two young English girls, who were at ease and\r\nsmiling, alone displayed some gaiety. While the headguard was trying to\r\ncalm the crowd, the younger of the two said to him in French, with a\r\nslight Britannic accent:\r\n\r\n"So, it is here that we stop, then, guard?"\r\n\r\nSeveral men had got down, notwithstanding the depth of snow in which\r\ntheir legs entirely disappeared. The American again found himself\r\nbeside the young man from Havre, and both made their way to the engine,\r\nto see for themselves. They tossed their heads.\r\n\r\n"It will take four or five hours to get us out of that," said one.\r\n\r\n"At least," answered the other, "and even then it will require a score\r\nof workmen."\r\n\r\nJacques had just persuaded the headguard to send his companion to\r\nBarentin to ask for help. Neither the driver nor the fireman could\r\nleave the engine.\r\n\r\nThe man was already far away, they soon lost sight of him at the end\r\nof the cutting. He had three miles to walk, and perhaps would not be\r\nback before two hours. And Jacques, in despair, left his post for an\r\ninstant, and ran to the first carriage where he perceived S\xc3\xa9verine who\r\nhad let down the glass.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be afraid," said he rapidly; "you have nothing to fear."\r\n\r\nShe answered in the same tone, avoiding familiarity lest she might be\r\noverheard:\r\n\r\n"I\'m not afraid; only I\'ve been very uneasy about you."\r\n\r\nAnd this was said so sweetly that both were consoled, and smiled at one\r\nanother. But as Jacques turned round, he was surprised to see Flore at\r\nthe top of the cutting; then Misard, accompanied by two other men,\r\nwhom he failed to recognise at first. They had heard the distress\r\nwhistle; and Misard, who was off duty, had hastened to the spot along\r\nwith his two companions, whom he had been treating to a morning draught\r\nof white wine. One of these men proved to be Cabuche, thrown out of\r\nwork by the snow, and the other Ozil, who had come from Malaunay\r\nthrough the tunnel, to pay court to Flore, whom he still pursued with\r\nhis attentions, in spite of the bad reception he met with. She, out of\r\ncuriosity, like a great vagabond girl, brave and strong as a young man,\r\naccompanied them.\r\n\r\nFor her and her father, this was a great event--an extraordinary\r\nadventure, this train stopping, so to say, at their door. During the\r\nfive years they had been living there, at every hour of the day and\r\nnight, in fine weather and foul, how many trains had they seen dart by!\r\nAll were borne away in the same breath that brought them. Not one had\r\neven slackened speed. They saw them dash ahead, fade in the distance,\r\ndisappear, before they had time to learn anything about them. The whole\r\nworld filed past; the human multitude carried along full steam, without\r\nthem having knowledge of aught else than faces caught sight of in a\r\nflash--faces they were never more to set eyes on, apart from a few that\r\nbecame familiar to them, through being seen over and over again on\r\nparticular days, and to which they could attach no name.\r\n\r\nAnd here, in the snow, a train arrived at their door. The natural order\r\nof things was reversed. They stared to their hearts\' content at this\r\nlittle unknown world of people, whom an accident had cast on the line;\r\nthey contemplated them with the rounded eyes of savages, who had sped\r\nto a shore where a number of Europeans had been shipwrecked. Those open\r\ndoors revealing ladies wrapped in furs, those men who had got out in\r\nthick overcoats; all this comfortable luxury, stranded amid this sea of\r\nice, struck them with astonishment.\r\n\r\nBut Flore had recognised S\xc3\xa9verine. She, who watched each time for the\r\ntrain driven by Jacques, had perceived, during the past few weeks,\r\nthe presence of this woman in the express on Friday morning; and the\r\nmore readily, as S\xc3\xa9verine, on approaching the level crossing, put\r\nher head out of the window to take a glance at her property of La\r\nCroix-de-Maufras. The eyes of Flore clouded as she noticed her talking\r\nin an undertone with the driver.\r\n\r\n"Ah! Madame Roubaud!" exclaimed Misard, who had also just recognised\r\nher; and at once assuming his obsequious manner, he continued: "What\r\ndreadful bad luck! But you cannot remain there, you must come to our\r\nhouse."\r\n\r\nJacques, after pressing the hand of the gateman, supported his\r\ninvitation.\r\n\r\n"He is right," said he. "We may have to wait here for hours, and you\r\nwill be perished to death."\r\n\r\nS\xc3\xa9verine refused. She was well wrapped up, she said. Then, the four\r\nhundred yards in the snow frightened her a little. Thereupon Flore drew\r\nnear, and, looking fixedly at her with her great eyes, ended by saying:\r\n\r\n"Come, madam, I will carry you."\r\n\r\nAnd before S\xc3\xa9verine had time to accept she had caught her in her arms,\r\nvigorous as those of a young man, and lifted her up like a little\r\nchild. She set her down on the other side of the line, at a spot which\r\nhad been well-trodden, and where the feet no longer sank into the snow.\r\nSome of the travellers began to laugh, marvelling at the achievement.\r\nWhat a strapping wench! If they only had a dozen of the same kidney the\r\ntrain would be free in a couple of hours.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, the suggestion that Misard had been heard to make,\r\nthis house of the gatekeeper, where they could take refuge, find a\r\nfire, and perhaps bread and wine, flew from one carriage to another.\r\nThe panic had calmed down when the people understood that they ran no\r\nimmediate danger; only the position remained none the less lamentable:\r\nthe foot-warmers were becoming cold, it was nine o\'clock, and if help\r\ntarried they would be suffering from hunger and thirst. Besides, the\r\nline might remain blocked much longer than was anticipated. Who could\r\nsay they would not have to sleep there?\r\n\r\nThe passengers divided into two camps: those who in despair would not\r\nquit the carriages, and installed themselves as if they were going to\r\nend their days there, wrapped up in their blankets, stretched out in a\r\npeevish frame of mind on the seats; and those who preferred risking the\r\ntrip, in the hope of finding more comfortable quarters, and, who above\r\nall, were desirous of escaping from this nightmare of a train stranded\r\nin the snow and being frozen to death. Quite a small party was formed,\r\nthe elderly commercial man and his young wife, the English lady and\r\nher two daughters, the young man from Havre, the American, and a dozen\r\nothers all ready to set out.\r\n\r\nJacques, in a low voice, had persuaded S\xc3\xa9verine to join them, vowing\r\nhe would take her news, if he could get away. And as Flore continued\r\nobserving them with her clouded eyes, he addressed her gently, like an\r\nold friend:\r\n\r\n"All right! It\'s understood, you will show these ladies and gentlemen\r\nthe way. I shall keep Misard and the others. We\'ll set to work and do\r\nwhat we can until help arrives."\r\n\r\nCabuche, Ozil, and Misard, in fact, at once caught hold of shovels\r\nto join Pecqueux and the headguard who were already attacking the\r\nsnow. The little gang strove to clear the engine, digging round the\r\nwheels and emptying their shovels against the sides of the cutting.\r\nNobody spoke, nothing could be heard but the sound of their impulsive\r\nlabour amid the gloomy oppression of the pallid country. And when the\r\nlittle troop of passengers were far away, they took a last look at the\r\ntrain, which remained alone, showing merely a thin black line beneath\r\nthe thick layer of white weighing on the top of it. The travellers\r\nremaining behind had closed the doors and put up the glasses. The snow\r\ncontinued falling, slowly but surely, and with mute obstinacy, burying\r\nengine and carriages.\r\n\r\nFlore wanted to take S\xc3\xa9verine in her arms again; but the latter\r\nrefused, wishing to walk like the others. The four hundred yards were\r\npainful to get over, particularly in the cutting where the people\r\nsank in up to the hips; and on two occasions it became necessary to\r\ngo to the rescue of the stout English lady who was half smothered.\r\nHer daughters, who were delighted, continued laughing. The young wife\r\nof the old gentleman, having slipped, consented to take the arm of\r\nthe young man from Havre; while her husband ran down France with the\r\nAmerican. On issuing from the cutting walking became easier; the little\r\nband advanced along an embankment in single file, beaten by the wind,\r\ncarefully avoiding the edges rendered uncertain and dangerous by the\r\nsnow.\r\n\r\nAt length they arrived, and Flore took them into the kitchen where she\r\nwas unable to find a seat for all, as there proved to be quite a score\r\nof them crowding the room, which fortunately was fairly large. The only\r\nthing she could think of was to go and fetch some planks, and rig up a\r\ncouple of forms by the aid of the chairs she possessed. She then threw\r\na faggot on the hearth, and made a gesture to indicate that they must\r\nnot ask her for anything more. She had not uttered a word. She remained\r\nerect, gazing at these people with her large greenish eyes, in the\r\nfierce, bold manner of a great blonde savage.\r\n\r\nApart from the face of S\xc3\xa9verine, those of the American, and the young\r\nman from Havre alone, were known to her. These she was familiar with\r\nthrough having frequently noticed them at the windows for months past;\r\nand she examined them, now, just as one studies an insect which, after\r\nbuzzing about in the air, has at length settled on something, and which\r\nit was impossible to follow on the wing. They struck her as peculiar.\r\nShe had not imagined them exactly thus, having caught but a glimpse of\r\ntheir features. As to the other people, they seemed to her to belong to\r\na different race--to be the inhabitants of an unknown land, fallen from\r\nthe sky, who brought into her home, right into her kitchen, garments,\r\ncustoms, and ideas that she had never anticipated finding there.\r\n\r\nThe English lady confided to the young wife of the commercial gentleman\r\nthat she was on her way to join her eldest son, a high functionary in\r\nIndia; and the young woman joked about the ill-luck she had met with,\r\non the first occasion she happened to have the caprice to accompany\r\nher husband to London where he went twice a year. All lamented being\r\nblocked in this desert. What were they to do for food, and how were\r\nthey going to sleep? What could be done, good heavens!\r\n\r\nFlore, who was listening to them motionless, having caught the eyes of\r\nS\xc3\xa9verine, seated on a chair before the fire, made her a sign that she\r\nwanted to take her into the adjoining room.\r\n\r\n"Mamma," said she as they entered, "it\'s Madame Roubaud. Wouldn\'t you\r\nlike to have a chat with her?"\r\n\r\nPhasie was in bed, her face yellow, her legs swollen; so ill that she\r\nhad not been able to get up for a fortnight. And she passed this time\r\nin the poorly furnished room, heated to suffocation by an iron stove,\r\nobstinately pondering over the fixed idea she had got into her head,\r\nwithout any other amusement than the shock of the trains as they flew\r\npast full speed.\r\n\r\n"Ah! Madame Roubaud," she murmured; "very good, very good."\r\n\r\nFlore told her of the accident, and spoke to her of the people she had\r\nbrought home, and who were there in the kitchen. But such things had\r\nceased to interest her.\r\n\r\n"Very good, very good," she repeated in the same weary voice.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she recollected, and raised her head an instant to say:\r\n\r\n"If madam would like to see her house, the keys are hanging there, near\r\nthe wardrobe."\r\n\r\nBut S\xc3\xa9verine refused. A shiver had come over her at the thought of\r\ngoing to La Croix-de-Maufras in this snow, in this livid daylight. No,\r\nno, there was nothing she desired to do there. She preferred to remain\r\nwhere she was, and wait in the warmth.\r\n\r\n"Be seated, madam," resumed Flore. "It is more comfortable here than in\r\nthe other room; and, besides, we shall never be able to find sufficient\r\nbread for all these people; whereas, if you are hungry, there will\r\nalways be a bit for you."\r\n\r\nShe had handed her a chair, and continued to show herself attentive,\r\nmaking a visible effort to attenuate her usual rough manner. But her\r\neyes never quitted the young woman. It seemed as if she wished to\r\nread her; to arrive at a certainty in regard to a particular question\r\nthat she had already been asking herself for some time; and, in her\r\neagerness, she felt a desire to approach her, to stare her out of\r\ncountenance, to touch her, so as to know.\r\n\r\nS\xc3\xa9verine expressed her thanks, and made herself comfortable near the\r\nstove, preferring, indeed, to be alone with the invalid in this room,\r\nwhere she hoped Jacques would find means to join her. Two hours passed.\r\nYielding to the oppressive heat, she had fallen asleep, after chatting\r\nabout the neighbourhood. Suddenly, Flore, who at every minute had been\r\nsummoned to the kitchen, opened the door, saying in her harsh tones:\r\n\r\n"Go in, as she is there."\r\n\r\nIt was Jacques who had escaped with good news. The man sent to Barentin\r\nhad just brought back a whole gang, some thirty soldiers, whom the\r\nadministration, foreseeing accidents, had dispatched to the threatened\r\npoints on the line; and they were all hard at work with pick and\r\nshovel. Only it would be a long job, and the train would, perhaps, not\r\nbe able to get off again before evening.\r\n\r\n"Anyhow, you are not so badly off," he added; "have patience. And, Aunt\r\nPhasie, you will not let Madame Roubaud starve, will you?"\r\n\r\nPhasie, at the sight of her big lad, as she called him, had with\r\ndifficulty sat up, and she looked at him, revived and happy, listening\r\nto him talking. When he had drawn near her bed, she replied:\r\n\r\n"Of course not, of course not. Ah! my big lad, so there you are. And\r\nso it\'s you who have got caught in the snow; and that silly girl never\r\ntold me so."\r\n\r\nTurning to her daughter, she said reproachfully:\r\n\r\n"Try and be polite, anyhow. Return to those ladies and gentlemen, show\r\nthem some attention, so that they may not tell the company that we are\r\nno better than savages."\r\n\r\nFlore remained planted between Jacques and S\xc3\xa9verine. She appeared to\r\nhesitate for an instant, asking herself if she should not obstinately\r\nremain there, in spite of her mother. But she reflected that she would\r\nsee nothing; the presence of the invalid would prevent any familiarity\r\nbetween the other two; and she withdrew, after taking a long look at\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n"What! Aunt Phasie!" exclaimed Jacques sadly; "you have taken to your\r\nbed for good? Then it\'s serious?"\r\n\r\nShe drew him towards her, forcing him even to seat himself at the edge\r\nof the mattress; and without troubling any further about the young\r\nwoman, who had discreetly moved away, she proceeded to relieve herself\r\nin a very low voice.\r\n\r\n"Oh! yes, serious! It\'s a miracle if you find me alive. I wouldn\'t\r\nwrite to you, because such things can\'t be written. I\'ve had a narrow\r\nescape; but now I am already better, and I believe I shall get over it\r\nagain this time."\r\n\r\nHe examined her, alarmed at the progress of the malady, and found she\r\nhad not preserved a vestige of the handsome, healthy woman of former\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n"Then you still suffer from your cramps and dizziness, my poor Aunt\r\nPhasie?" said he.\r\n\r\nShe squeezed his hand fit to crush it, continuing in a still lower tone:\r\n\r\n"Just fancy, I caught him. You know, that do what I would, I could not\r\nfind out how he managed to give me his drug. I didn\'t drink, I didn\'t\r\neat anything he touched, and all the same, every night I had my inside\r\nafire. Well, he mixed it with the salt! One night, I saw him; and I was\r\nin the habit of putting salt on everything in quantities to make the\r\nfood healthy!"\r\n\r\nSince Jacques had known S\xc3\xa9verine, he sometimes pondered in doubt over\r\nthis story of slow and obstinate poisoning, as one thinks of the\r\nnightmare. In his turn he tenderly pressed the hands of the invalid,\r\nand sought to calm her.\r\n\r\n"Come, is all this possible? To say such things you should really be\r\nquite sure; and, besides, it drags on too long. Ah! it\'s more likely an\r\nillness that the doctors do not understand!"\r\n\r\n"An illness," she resumed, with a sneer; "yes, an illness that he\r\nstuck into me! As for the doctors, you are right; two came here, who\r\nunderstood nothing, and who were not even of the same mind. I\'ll never\r\nallow another of such creatures to put a foot in this house again. Do\r\nyou hear, he gave it me in the salt. I swear to you I saw him! It\'s for\r\nmy 1,000 frcs., the 1,000 frcs. papa left me. He says to himself, that\r\nwhen he has done away with me, he\'ll soon find them. But, as to that,\r\nI defy him. They are in a place where nobody will find them. Never,\r\nnever! I may die, but I am at ease on that score. No one will ever have\r\nmy 1,000 frcs.!"\r\n\r\n"But, Aunt Phasie," answered Jacques, "in your place, if I were so sure\r\nas all that, I should send for the gendarmes."\r\n\r\nShe made a gesture of repugnance.\r\n\r\n"Oh! no, not the gendarmes," said she. "This matter only concerns\r\nus. It is between him and me. I know that he wants to gobble me up;\r\nand naturally I do not wish him to do it. So you see I have only to\r\ndefend myself; not to be such a fool as I have been with his salt.\r\nEh! who would ever have thought it? An abortion like that, a little\r\nwhipper-snapper of a man whom one could stuff into one\'s pocket, and\r\nwho, in the long-run, would get the better of a big woman like me, if\r\none let him have his own way with his teeth like those of a rat."\r\n\r\nShe was seized with a little shiver, and breathed heavily before she\r\ncould conclude.\r\n\r\n"No matter," said she at last, "he will be short of his reckoning\r\nagain this time. I am getting better. I shall be on my legs before a\r\nfortnight. And he\'ll have to be very clever to catch me again. Ah! yes,\r\nI shall be curious to see him do it. If he discovers a way to give me\r\nany more of his drug, he will decidedly be the stronger of the two; and\r\nthen, so much the worse for me. I shall kick the bucket. But I don\'t\r\nwant to have any meddling between us!"\r\n\r\nJacques thought it must be her illness that caused her brain to be\r\nhaunted by these sombre ideas; and, to amuse her, he tried joking,\r\nwhen, all at once, she began trembling under the bedclothes.\r\n\r\n"Here he is," she whispered. "I can feel him coming whenever he\r\napproaches."\r\n\r\nAnd sure enough, Misard entered a few seconds afterwards. She\r\nhad become livid, a prey to that indomitable fright which huge\r\ncreatures feel in presence of the insect that preys upon them.\r\nFor, notwithstanding her obstinate determination to defend herself\r\nsingle-handed, she felt an increasing terror of him that she would\r\nnot confess. Misard cast a sharp look at her and the driver, from\r\nthe threshold, and then, gave himself an air of not having noticed\r\nthem side by side. With his expressionless eyes, his thin lips, his\r\nmild manner of a puny man, he was already showing great attention to\r\nS\xc3\xa9verine.\r\n\r\n"I thought madam would perhaps like to take advantage of the\r\nopportunity, to have a look at her property. So I managed to slip away\r\nfor a moment. If madam wishes I will accompany her."\r\n\r\nAnd as the young woman still refused, he continued in a doleful voice:\r\n\r\n"Madam was perhaps surprised in regard to the fruit. It was all\r\nwormeaten, and was really not worth packing up. Then we had a gale\r\nthat did a lot of harm. Ah! it\'s a pity madam cannot sell the place!\r\nOne gentleman came who wanted some repairs done. Anyhow, I am at the\r\ndisposal of madam; and madam may be sure that I replace her here, as if\r\nshe were here herself."\r\n\r\nThen he insisted on giving her bread and pears, pears from his own\r\ngarden, which were not wormeaten, and she accepted.\r\n\r\nAs Misard crossed the kitchen he told the passengers that the work of\r\nclearing away the snow was proceeding, but it would take another four\r\nor five hours. It had struck midday, and there ensued more lamentation,\r\nfor all were becoming very hungry. Flore had just declared that she\r\nwould not have sufficient bread for everyone. But she had plenty of\r\nwine. She had brought ten quarts up from the cellar, and only a moment\r\nbefore, had set them in a line on the table.\r\n\r\nThen there were not enough glasses, and they had to drink by groups,\r\nthe English lady with her two daughters, the old gentleman with his\r\nyoung wife. The latter had found a zealous, inventful groom in the\r\nyoung man from Havre, who watched over her well-being. He disappeared\r\nand returned with apples and a loaf which he had found in the\r\nwoodhouse. Flore was angry, saying this was bread for her sick mother.\r\nBut he had already commenced cutting it up, and handing pieces to the\r\nladies, beginning with the young wife, who smiled at him amiably,\r\nfeeling very much flattered at his attention.\r\n\r\nHer husband was not offended; indeed, he no longer paid any attention\r\nto her, being engaged with the American in exalting the commercial\r\ncustoms of New York. The two English girls had never munched apples\r\nso heartily. Their mother, who felt very weary, was half asleep.\r\nTwo ladies were seated on the ground before the hearth, overcome by\r\nwaiting. Men who had gone out to smoke, in front of the house to kill a\r\nquarter of an hour, returned perishing and shivering with cold. Little\r\nby little the uneasy feeling increased, partly from hunger having only\r\nbeen half satisfied and partly from fatigue, augmented by impatience\r\nand absence of all comfort. The scene was assuming the aspect of a\r\nshipwrecked camp, of the desolation of a band of civilised people, cast\r\nby the waves on a desert island.\r\n\r\nAnd as Misard, going backward and forward, left the door open, Aunt\r\nPhasie gazed on the picture from her bed of sickness. So these were the\r\nkind of people whom she had seen flash past, during close upon a year\r\nthat she had been dragging herself from her mattress to her chair. It\r\nwas now but rarely that she could go on to the siding. She passed her\r\ndays and nights alone, riveted there, her eyes on the window, without\r\nany other company than those trains which flew by so swiftly.\r\n\r\nShe had always complained of this outlandish place, where they never\r\nreceived a visit; and here was quite a small crowd come from the\r\nunknown. And only to think that among them--among those people in a\r\nhurry to get to their business--not one had the least idea of the thing\r\nthat troubled her, of that filth which had been mixed with her salt!\r\nShe had taken that device to heart, and she asked herself how it was\r\npossible for a person to be guilty of such cunning rascality without\r\nanybody perceiving it. A sufficient multitude passed by them, thousands\r\nand thousands of people; but they all dashed on, not one would have\r\nimagined that a murder was calmly being committed in this little,\r\nlow-roofed dwelling, without any set out. And Aunt Phasie looked at\r\none after the other of these persons, fallen as it were from the moon,\r\nreflecting that when people have their minds so occupied with other\r\nthings, it is not surprising that they should walk into pools of mire,\r\nand not know it.\r\n\r\n"Are you going back there?" Misard inquired of Jacques.\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes," replied the latter; "I\'m coming immediately."\r\n\r\nMisard went off closing the door. And Phasie, retaining the young man\r\nby the hand, whispered in his ear:\r\n\r\n"If I kick the bucket, you\'ll see what a face he\'ll pull when he\'s\r\nunable to find the cash. That\'s what amuses me when I think of it. I\r\nshall go off contented all the same."\r\n\r\n"And then, Aunt Phasie, it\'ll be lost for everybody," said Jacques.\r\n"Won\'t you leave it to your daughter?"\r\n\r\n"To Flore? For him to take it from her? Ah! no, for certain. Not even\r\nto you, my big lad, because you also are too stupid, he\'d get some of\r\nit. To no one; to the earth, where I shall go and join it!"\r\n\r\nShe was exhausted, and Jacques, having made her comfortable in bed,\r\ncalmed her by embracing her, and promising to return and see her again\r\nshortly. Then, as she seemed to be falling asleep, he passed behind\r\nS\xc3\xa9verine, who was still seated near the stove, raising his finger with\r\na smile to caution her to be prudent. In a pretty, silent movement she\r\nthrew back her head offering her lips, and he, bending over, pressed\r\nhis mouth to them in a deep discreet kiss. Their eyes closed, and when\r\nthe lids rose again it was to find Flore standing in the doorway gazing\r\nat them.\r\n\r\n"Has madam done with the bread?" she inquired in a hoarse voice.\r\n\r\nS\xc3\xa9verine, confused and very much annoyed, stammered out:\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes. Thank you."\r\n\r\nFor an instant Jacques fixed his flaming eyes on the girl. He\r\nhesitated, his lips trembling, as if he wanted to speak. Then, with a\r\nfurious, threatening gesture, he made up his mind to leave. The door\r\nwas slammed violently behind him.\r\n\r\nFlore remained erect, presenting the tall stature of a warrior virgin,\r\ncoifed with a heavy helmet of fair hair. So she had not been deceived\r\nby the anguish she had felt each Friday, at the sight of this lady\r\nin the train he drove. She was at last in possession of the absolute\r\ncertainty she had been seeking since she held them there together.\r\nThe man she was in love with, would never love her. It was this slim\r\nwoman, this insignificant creature that he had chosen; and her regret\r\nat having refused him a kiss that night when he had brutally attempted\r\nto take one, touched her so keenly that she would have sobbed. For,\r\naccording to her simple reasoning, it would have been she whom he would\r\nhave embraced now, had she kissed him before the other. Where could she\r\nfind him alone at this hour, to cast herself on his neck and cry, "Take\r\nme, I was stupid, because I did not know!"\r\n\r\nBut, in her impotence, she felt a rage rising within her against the\r\nfrail creature seated there, uneasy and stammering. With one clasp\r\nof her arms, hard as those of a wrestler, she could stifle her like\r\na little bird. Why did she hesitate to do so? She vowed she would be\r\nrevenged, nevertheless, being aware of things connected with this\r\nrival that would send her to prison, she whom they permitted to remain\r\nat liberty; and tortured by jealousy, bursting with anger, she began\r\nclearing away the remainder of the bread and pears with the hasty\r\nmovements of a beautiful untamed girl.\r\n\r\n"As madam will take no more, I\'ll give this to the others," said she.\r\n\r\nThree o\'clock struck, then four o\'clock. The time dragged on,\r\nimmeasurably long, amidst increasing lassitude and irritation. Here\r\nwas livid night returning to the vast expanse of white country. Every\r\nten minutes the men who went out to see from a distance how the work\r\nwas proceeding, returned with the information that the engine did not\r\nappear to be cleared. Even the two English girls began weeping in a\r\nfit of enervation. In a corner, the pretty dark lady had fallen asleep\r\nagainst the shoulder of the young man from Havre, a circumstance the\r\nelderly husband did not even notice, amid the general abandonment that\r\nhad swept away decorum.\r\n\r\nThe room was becoming cold. Everyone was shivering, and not a soul\r\nthought of throwing some wood on the fire. The American took himself\r\noff, thinking he would feel much more comfortable stretched out on one\r\nof the seats in a carriage. That was now the general idea. Everyone\r\nexpressed regret: they should have remained where they were. Anyhow,\r\nhad they done so, they would never have been devoured by the anxiety to\r\nlearn what was going on there. It was necessary to restrain the English\r\nlady, who also spoke of regaining her compartment, and going to bed\r\nthere. When they placed a candle on a corner of the table, to light\r\nthe people in this dark kitchen, the feeling of discouragement became\r\nintense, and everyone gave way to dull despair.\r\n\r\nThe removal of the snow from the line was nevertheless coming to an\r\nend; and while the troop of soldiers, who had set the engine free, were\r\nclearing the metals in front, the driver and fireman had ascended to\r\ntheir post.\r\n\r\nJacques, observing that the snow had at last ceased, regained\r\nconfidence. Ozil, the pointsman, had told him positively, that on the\r\nother side of the tunnel, in the neighbourhood of Malaunay, the state\r\nof the line was much better. But he questioned him again.\r\n\r\n"You came through the tunnel on foot, and were able to enter, and issue\r\nfrom it without any difficulty?" said he.\r\n\r\n"When I keep on telling you so," answered the other. "You will get\r\nthrough, take my word for it."\r\n\r\nCabuche, who had been working with the energy of a good giant, was\r\nalready retiring in his timid, shy manner, which his recent difference\r\nwith the judicial authorities had only increased; and it became\r\nnecessary for Jacques to call to him.\r\n\r\n"I say, comrade," he shouted, "hand me those shovels that belong to\r\nus, over there against the slope, so that if we happen to want them we\r\nshall be able to find them again."\r\n\r\nAnd when the quarryman had rendered him this last service he gave him\r\na hearty shake of the hand, to show him that he felt esteem for him in\r\nspite of all, having seen him at work.\r\n\r\n"You are a good fellow, you are," said he.\r\n\r\nThis mark of friendship agitated Cabuche in an extraordinary manner.\r\n\r\n"Thank you," he answered simply, stifling his tears.\r\n\r\nMisard, who had made friends with him again, after accusing him before\r\nthe examining-magistrate, gave his approval with an inclination of the\r\nhead, pinching his lips into a slight smile. He had long since ceased\r\nworking, and, with his hands in his pockets, stood gazing at the train\r\nwith a bilious look, as if waiting to see whether he would not be able\r\nto pick up something lost between the wheels.\r\n\r\nAt length, the headguard had just decided with Jacques that an attempt\r\ncould be made to go on again, when Pecqueux, who had got down on to the\r\nline, called the driver.\r\n\r\n"Come and look!" said he. "One of the cylinders has had a shock."\r\n\r\nJacques, approaching him, also bent down. He had already discovered, on\r\nexamining La Lison carefully, that it had received a blow at the place\r\nindicated. In clearing the engine, the workmen had ascertained that\r\nsome oak sleepers, left at the bottom of the slope by the platelayers,\r\nhad been shifted by the action of the snow and wind, so that they\r\nrested on the rails; and the stoppage, even, must have been partly due\r\nto this obstruction, for the locomotive had run against the sleepers.\r\nThey could see the scratch on the box of the cylinder, and the piston\r\nit enclosed seemed slightly bent; but that was all the visible harm,\r\nand the fears of the driver were at first removed. Perhaps there\r\nexisted serious interior injuries; nothing is more delicate than the\r\ncomplicated mechanism of the slide valves, where beats the heart, the\r\nliving spirit of the machine.\r\n\r\nJacques got up again, blew the whistle, and opened the regulator to\r\nfeel the articulations of La Lison. It took a long time to move, like a\r\nperson bruised by a fall, who has difficulty in recovering the use of\r\nhis limbs. At last, with a painful puff, it started, gave a few turns\r\nof the wheels still dizzy and ponderous. It would do, it could move,\r\nand would perform the journey. Only Jacques tossed his head, for he,\r\nwho knew the locomotive thoroughly, had just felt something singular in\r\nhis hand--something that had undergone a change, that had grown old,\r\nthat had been touched somewhere with a mortal blow. It must have got\r\nthis in the snow, cut to the heart, a death chill, like those strongly\r\nbuilt young women who fall into a decline through having returned home\r\none night, from a ball, in icy cold rain.\r\n\r\nAgain Jacques blew the whistle, after Pecqueux had opened the exhaust\r\npipe. The two guards were at their posts. Mizard, Ozil, and Cabuche,\r\nhad got on the footboard of the leading van; and the train slowly\r\nissued from the cutting between the soldiers, armed with their shovels,\r\nwho had stood back to right and left along the base of the slopes. Then\r\nit stopped before the house of the gatekeeper to pick up the passengers.\r\n\r\nFlore was there, in front. Ozil and Cabuche joined her and remained at\r\nher side; while Misard was now assiduous in his attentions, greeting\r\nthe ladies and gentlemen who left his dwelling, and collecting the\r\nsilver pieces. So at last the deliverance had come. But they had waited\r\ntoo long. All these people were shivering with cold, dying of hunger\r\nand exhaustion. The English lady led off her two daughters, who were\r\nhalf asleep; the young man from Havre got into the same compartment\r\nas the pretty dark lady, who looked very languid, and made himself\r\nmost agreeable to the husband. And what with the slush caused by the\r\ntrampled-down snow, the pushing, the free and easy manners, anyone\r\nmight almost have imagined himself present at the entraining of a troop\r\nin flight, who had lost even the instinct of decent behaviour.\r\n\r\nFor an instant, Aunt Phasie appeared at the window of her room.\r\nCuriosity had bought her from her mattress, and she had dragged herself\r\nthere to see. Her great hollow eyes of sickness watched this unknown\r\ncrowd, these passers-by of the world on the move, whom she would never\r\nlook on again, who were brought there and borne away by the tempest.\r\n\r\nS\xc3\xa9verine left the house the last. Turning her head she smiled at\r\nJacques, who leant over to follow her to her carriage with his eyes.\r\nAnd Flore, who was on the look-out for them, again turned pale at this\r\ntranquil exchange of tenderness. Abruptly she drew nearer to Ozil, whom\r\nhitherto she had repelled, as if now, in her hatred, she felt the need\r\nof a man.\r\n\r\nThe headguard gave the signal. La Lison answered with a plaintive\r\nwhistle; and Jacques this time started off, not to stop again before\r\nRouen. It was six o\'clock. Night was completing its descent from\r\nthe black sky on to the white earth; but a pale, and frightfully\r\nmelancholy reflex remained nearly level with the ground, lighting up\r\nthe desolation of the ravaged country. And, in this uncertain glimmer,\r\nthe house of La Croix-de-Maufras rose up aslant, more dilapidated than\r\never, and all black in the midst of the snow, with the notice nailed to\r\nthe shut-up front, "For Sale."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe train did not reach the Paris terminus before 10.40 at night. There\r\nhad been a stoppage of twenty minutes at Rouen to give the passengers\r\ntime to dine; and S\xc3\xa9verine had hastened to telegraph to her husband\r\nthat she would only return to Havre by the express on the following\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nAs they left Mantes, Pecqueux had an idea. Mother Victoire, his wife,\r\nhad been at the hospital for a week, laid up with a severely sprained\r\nankle occasioned by a fall; and, as he could find a bed at the house\r\nof some friends, he desired to offer their room to Madame Roubaud. She\r\nwould be much more comfortable than at a hotel in the neighbourhood,\r\nand could remain there until the following night as if she were at\r\nhome. And, when she approached the locomotive, among the swarm of\r\npassengers who at last left the carriages under the marquee, Jacques\r\nadvised her to accept, at the same time holding out to her the key\r\nwhich the fireman had given him. But S\xc3\xa9verine hesitated.\r\n\r\n"No, no," said she, "I\'ve a cousin. She will make me up a bed."\r\n\r\nJacques looked at her so earnestly that she ended by taking the key;\r\nwhile he, bending forward, whispered: "Wait for me."\r\n\r\nS\xc3\xa9verine had only to take a few steps up the Rue d\'Amsterdam, and turn\r\ninto the Impasse, or Blind Alley of the same name. But the snow was so\r\nslippery that she had to walk very cautiously. She had the good fortune\r\nto find the door of the house still open, and ascended the staircase\r\nwithout even being seen by the portress, who was deep in a game of\r\ndominoes with a neighbour. On the fifth floor she opened the door and\r\nclosed it so softly that certainly none of the neighbours could suspect\r\nher there. Crossing the landing on the floor below, she had very\r\ndistinctly heard laughter and singing at the Dauvergnes; doubtless one\r\nof the small receptions of the two sisters, who invited their friends\r\nto musical evenings once a week.\r\n\r\nAnd now that S\xc3\xa9verine had closed the door, and found herself in the\r\noppressive darkness of the room, she could still distinguish the sound\r\nof the lively gaiety of all this youth coming through the boards. For\r\na moment the obscurity seemed to her complete; and she started when\r\nthe cuckoo clock, amidst the gloom, began to ring out eleven with deep\r\nstrokes--a sound she recognised. Then her eyes became accustomed to\r\nthe dimness of the apartment. The two windows stood out in two pale\r\nsquares, lighting the ceiling with the reflex of the snow. She was\r\nalready beginning to find her way about, seeking for the matches on the\r\nsideboard in a corner where she recollected having seen them. But she\r\nhad more difficulty in finding a candle. At last she discovered the\r\nend of one at the back of a drawer; and having put a lucifer to it the\r\nroom was lit up. At once she cast a rapid, anxious glance around, as if\r\nto make sure that she was quite alone. She recognised everything: the\r\nround table where she had lunched with her husband; the bed draped with\r\nred cotton material, beside which he had knocked her down with a blow\r\nfrom his fist. It was there sure enough, nothing had been changed in\r\nthe room during her absence of six months.\r\n\r\nS\xc3\xa9verine slowly removed her hat. But, as she was also about to set\r\naside her cloak, she shivered. It was as cold as ice in this room. In a\r\nsmall box near the stove, were coal and firewood. Immediately, without\r\ntaking off her wraps, she began to light the fire. This occupation\r\namused her, serving as a diversion from the uneasiness she had at\r\nfirst experienced. When the stove began to draw, she busied herself\r\nwith other household duties, arranging the chairs as it pleased her to\r\nsee them, looking out clean sheets, and making the bed again, which\r\ncaused her a deal of trouble, as it was unusually wide. She felt\r\nannoyed to find nothing to eat or drink in the sideboard. Doubtless\r\nPecqueux had made a clean sweep of everything during the three days he\r\nhad been master there. It was the same in regard to the light, there\r\nbeing only this single bit of candle.\r\n\r\nAnd now, feeling very warm and lively, she stood in the middle of the\r\nroom glancing round to make sure that everything was in order. Then,\r\njust as she was beginning to feel astonished that Jacques had not yet\r\narrived, a whistle drew her to one of the windows. It was the 11.20\r\nthrough train to Havre that was leaving. Below, the vast expanse, the\r\ntrench extending from the station to the Batignolles tunnel, appeared\r\none sheet of snow where naught could be distinguished save the fan\r\nof metals with its black branches. The engines and carriages on the\r\nsidings formed white heaps, looking as if they rested beneath coverings\r\nof ermine. And between the immaculate glass of the great marquees and\r\nthe ironwork of the Pont de l\'Europe bordered with frets, the houses\r\nin the Rue de Rome opposite, in spite of the darkness, could be seen\r\njumbled together in a tint of dirty yellow.\r\n\r\nThe through train for Havre went along, crawling and sombre, its front\r\nlamp boring the obscurity with a bright flame; and S\xc3\xa9verine watched it\r\nvanish under the bridge, reddening the snow with its three back lights.\r\nOn turning from the window she gave another brief shiver--was she\r\nreally quite alone? She seemed to feel a warm breath heating the back\r\nof her neck, a brutal blow grazing her skin through her clothes. Her\r\nwidely opened eyes again looked round. No, no one.\r\n\r\nWhat could Jacques be after, to remain so long as this? Another ten\r\nminutes passed. A slight scraping, a sound of finger-nails scratching\r\nagainst wood, alarmed her. Then she understood, and hastened to open\r\nthe door. It was Jacques with a bottle of Malaga and a cake.\r\n\r\nIn an outburst of tenderness she threw her arms round his neck,\r\nrippling with laughter.\r\n\r\n"Oh! you pet of a man to have thought to bring something," she\r\nexclaimed.\r\n\r\nBut he quickly silenced her.\r\n\r\n"Hush! hush!" he whispered.\r\n\r\nAnd she, fancying he might be pursued by the portress, lowered her\r\nvoice. No; as he was about to ring, he had the luck to see the door\r\nopen to let out a lady and her daughter, who had no doubt come down\r\nfrom the Dauvergnes; and he had been able to come up unperceived. Only\r\nthere, on the landing, through the door standing ajar, he had just\r\ncaught sight of the newsvendor woman who was finishing a little washing\r\nin a basin.\r\n\r\n"Let us make as little noise as possible," said he. "Speak low."\r\n\r\nS\xc3\xa9verine replied by squeezing him passionately in her arms and covering\r\nhis face with silent kisses. This game of mystery, speaking no louder\r\nthan a whisper, diverted her.\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes," she said; "you shall see: we will be as quiet as two little\r\nmice."\r\n\r\nShe took all kinds of precautions in laying the table: two plates, two\r\nglasses, two knives, stopping with a desire to burst out laughing when\r\none article, set down too hastily, rang against another.\r\n\r\nJacques, who was watching her, also became amused.\r\n\r\n"I thought you would be hungry," said he in a low voice.\r\n\r\n"Why, I am famished!" she answered. "We dined so badly at Rouen!"\r\n\r\n"Well, then, let me run down and fetch a fowl," he suggested.\r\n\r\n"Ah! no," said she; "the portress might not let you come up again! No,\r\nno, the cake will do."\r\n\r\nThey immediately seated themselves side by side, almost on the\r\nsame chair; and the cake was divided and eaten amid the frolics of\r\nsweethearts. She said she was thirsty, and swallowed two glasses of\r\nMalaga, one after the other, which flushed her cheeks. The stove,\r\nreddening behind their backs, thrilled them with warmth. But, as he was\r\nkissing her on the neck too loudly, she, in her turn, stopped him.\r\n\r\n"Hush! hush!" she whispered.\r\n\r\nShe made him a sign to listen; and, in the silence, they distinguished\r\na swaying movement to the accompaniment of music, ascending from the\r\nDauvergnes; these young ladies had just arranged a hop. Hard by, the\r\nnewsvendor was throwing the soapy water from her basin down the sink\r\non the landing. She shut her door. The dancing downstairs had for a\r\nmoment ceased; and outside, beneath the window, nothing could be heard\r\nbut a dull rumble, stifled by the snow--the departure of a train, which\r\nseemed weeping with low whistles.\r\n\r\n"An Auteuil train," murmured Jacques. "Ten minutes to twelve."\r\n\r\nShe made no answer, being absorbed by thoughts of the past, in her\r\nfever of happiness, living over again the hours she had passed there\r\nwith her husband. Was this not the bygone lunch continuing with the\r\ncake, eaten on the same table, amid the same sounds? She became more\r\nand more excited, recollections flowed fast upon her. Never had she\r\nexperienced such a burning necessity to tell her sweetheart everything,\r\nto deliver herself up to him completely. She felt, as it were, the\r\nphysical desire to do so. It seemed to her that she would belong to\r\nhim more absolutely were she to make her confession in his ear. Past\r\nevents came vividly to her mind. Her husband was there. She turned her\r\nhead, imagining she had just seen his short, hirsute hand pass over\r\nher shoulder to grasp the knife.\r\n\r\n"Hullo! the candle is going out," said Jacques.\r\n\r\nShe shrugged her shoulders, as if to say she did not care. Then,\r\nstifling a laugh, she whispered:\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been good, eh?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! yes!" he answered. "No one has heard us. We\'ve been exactly like\r\ntwo little mice."\r\n\r\nThey said no more. The room was in darkness. Barely could the pale\r\nsquares of glass be distinguished at the two windows; but on the\r\nceiling appeared a ray from the stove, forming a round crimson spot.\r\nBoth gazed at it with wide open eyes. The music had ceased. There came\r\na slamming of doors; and then all the house fell into the peacefulness\r\nof heavy slumber. The train from Caen, arriving below, shook the\r\nturn-tables with dull shocks that barely reached them, so far did they\r\nseem away.\r\n\r\nAnd now, S\xc3\xa9verine again felt the desire to make her confession. She\r\nhad been tormented by this feeling for weeks. The round spot on the\r\nceiling increased in size, appearing to spread out like a spurt of\r\nblood. She had a fit of hallucination by looking at it. The objects\r\nround the bedstead took voices, relating the story aloud. She felt the\r\nwords rising to her lips in the nervous wave passing through her frame.\r\nHow delightful it would be to have nothing hidden, to confide in him\r\nentirely!\r\n\r\n"You know, darling----" she began.\r\n\r\nJacques, who had also been steadily watching the red spot, understood\r\nwhat she was about to say. He had observed her increasing uneasiness in\r\nregard to this obscure, hideous subject which was present in both their\r\nminds, although they never alluded to it. Hitherto he had prevented\r\nher speaking, dreading the precursory shiver of his former complaint,\r\ntrembling lest their affection might suffer if they were to talk of\r\nblood together. But, on this occasion, he did not feel the strength to\r\nbend his head, and seal her lips with a kiss. He thought it settled,\r\nthat she would say all. And so, he was relieved of his anxiety, when,\r\nappearing to become troubled, she hesitated, then shrank back, and\r\nobserved:\r\n\r\n"You know, darling, my husband suspects we are in love with one\r\nanother."\r\n\r\nAt the last second, in spite of herself, it was the recollection of\r\nwhat had passed the night before at Havre, that came to her lips,\r\ninstead of the confession.\r\n\r\n"Oh! Do you think so?" he murmured incredulous. "He seems so nice. He\r\ngave me his hand again this morning."\r\n\r\n"I assure you he knows," she replied. "I have the proof."\r\n\r\nS\xc3\xa9verine paused. Then, after a quivering meditation, she exclaimed:\r\n\r\n"Oh! I hate him! I hate him!"\r\n\r\nJacques was surprised. He had no ill-feeling against Roubaud.\r\n\r\n"Indeed! Why is that?" he inquired "He does not interfere with us!"\r\n\r\nWithout replying, she repeated:\r\n\r\n"I hate him! The mere idea of his being beside me is a torture. Ah! If\r\nI could, I would run away, I would remain with you!"\r\n\r\nJacques pressed her to him. Then, after another pause, she resumed:\r\n\r\n"But you do not know, darling----"\r\n\r\nThe confession was on her lips again, fatally, inevitably. And this\r\ntime he felt certain that nothing in the world would delay it. Not\r\na sound could be heard in the house. The newsvendor even must have\r\nbeen in deep slumber. Outside, Paris covered with snow was wrapped in\r\nsilence. Not a rumble of a vehicle could be heard in the streets. The\r\nlast train for Havre, which had left at twenty minutes after midnight,\r\nseemed to have borne away the final vestige of life in the station. The\r\nstove had ceased roaring. The fire burning to ashes, gave fresh vigour\r\nto the red spot circling on the ceiling like a terrified eye. It was so\r\nwarm that a heavy, stifling mist seemed to weigh down on them.\r\n\r\n"Darling, you do not know----" she repeated.\r\n\r\nThen he also spoke, unable to restrain himself any longer:\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, I know," said he.\r\n\r\n"No; you may think you do, but you cannot know," she answered.\r\n\r\n"I know that he did it for the legacy," he retorted.\r\n\r\nShe made a movement, and gave an involuntary little nervous laugh.\r\n\r\n"Ah! bosh; the legacy!" she remarked.\r\n\r\nAnd, in a very low voice, so low that a moth grazing the window panes,\r\nwould have made a louder sound, she related her childhood at the\r\nhouse of the sister of President Grandmorin. Gaining courage as she\r\nproceeded, she continued in her low tone:\r\n\r\n"Just fancy, it was here in this room, last February. You recollect,\r\nat the time when he had his quarrel with the sub-prefect. We had\r\nlunched very nicely--just as we have supped now--there, on that table.\r\nNaturally, he knew nothing, I had not gone out of my way to relate\r\nthe story. But all of a sudden, about a ring, an old present, about\r\nnothing, I know not how it occurred, he understood everything. Ah! my\r\ndarling! No, no; you cannot imagine how he treated me!"\r\n\r\nAfter a shudder, she resumed:\r\n\r\n"With a blow from his fist, he knocked me to the ground. And then he\r\ndragged me along by the hair. Next he raised his heel above my face,\r\nas if he would crush it. No; as long as I live, I shall never forget\r\nthat! After this came more blows, to force me to answer his questions.\r\nNo doubt he loved me. He must have been very much pained when he heard\r\nall he made me tell him; and I confess that it would have been more\r\nstraightforward on my part to have warned him before our marriage.\r\nOnly, you must understand that this intrigue was old and forgotten. No\r\none but a positive savage would have become so mad with jealousy. You,\r\nyourself, my darling, will you cease to love me on account of what you\r\nnow know?"\r\n\r\nJacques had not moved. He sat inert, reflecting. He felt very much\r\nsurprised. Never had he a suspicion of such a story. How everything\r\nbecame complicated, when the will sufficed to account for the crime!\r\nBut he preferred that matters should be as they were. The certainty\r\nthat the couple had not killed for money, relieved him of a feeling of\r\ncontempt.\r\n\r\n"I! cease to love you. Why?" he inquired. "I do not care a fig about\r\nyour past. It does not concern me."\r\n\r\nAfter a silence, he added:\r\n\r\n"And then, what about the old man?"\r\n\r\nIn a very low tone, with an effort of all her being, she confessed.\r\n\r\n"Yes; we killed him," she answered. "He made me write to the President\r\nto leave by the express, at the same time as we did, and not to show\r\nhimself until he reached Rouen. I remained trembling in my corner,\r\ndistracted at the thought of the woe into which we were plunging.\r\nOpposite me sat a woman in black, who said nothing, and who gave me\r\na great fright. I could not even look at her. I imagined she could\r\ndistinctly read in our brains what was passing there, that she knew\r\nvery well what we meant to do. It was thus that the two hours were\r\nspent from Paris to Rouen. I did not utter one word. I did not move,\r\nbut closed my eyes to make believe I was asleep. I felt him beside\r\nme, motionless also; and what terrified me was my knowledge of the\r\nterrible things that were rolling in his head, without being able to\r\nmake an exact guess of what he had resolved to do. Ah! what a journey,\r\nwith that whirling flood of thoughts, amidst the whistling of the\r\nlocomotive, and the jolting, and the thunder of the wheels!"\r\n\r\n"But, as you were not in the same compartment, how were you able to\r\nkill him?" inquired Jacques.\r\n\r\n"Wait a minute, and you will understand," answered S\xc3\xa9verine. "It was\r\nall arranged by my husband; but if the plan proved successful, it was\r\nentirely due to chance. There was a stoppage of ten minutes at Rouen.\r\nWe got down, and he compelled me to walk with him to the coup\xc3\xa9 occupied\r\nby the President, like persons who were stretching their legs. And\r\nthere, seeing M. Grandmorin at the door, he affected surprise, as if\r\nunaware of his being in the train. On the platform there was a crush, a\r\nstream of people forced their way into the second-class carriages all\r\ngoing to Havre, where there was to be a f\xc3\xaate on the morrow.\r\n\r\n"When they began to close the doors, the President invited us into\r\nhis compartment. I hesitated, mentioning our valise; but he cried out\r\nthat there was no fear of anyone taking it, and that we could return\r\nto our carriage at Barentin, as he would be getting down there. At one\r\nmoment my husband, who was anxious, seemed as if he wanted to run and\r\nfetch the valise; but at that same minute, the guard whistled, and\r\nRoubaud, making up his mind, pushed me into the coup\xc3\xa9, got in after me,\r\nclosed the door, and put up the glass. How it happened that we were not\r\nperceived, I have never been able to comprehend! A number of persons\r\nwere running, the railway officials appeared to lose their heads,\r\nfinally not a single witness came forward who had seen anything. At\r\nlast, the train slowly left the station."\r\n\r\nShe paused a few seconds, unconsciously living the scene over again,\r\nand then resumed:\r\n\r\n"Ah! during the first moments in that coup\xc3\xa9, as I felt the ground\r\nflying beneath me, I was quite dizzy. At the commencement, I thought\r\nof nothing but our valise: how were we to recover it? And would it\r\nnot betray us if we left it where it was? The whole thing seemed to\r\nme stupid, devoid of reason, like a murder dreamed of by a child,\r\nunder the influence of nightmare, which anyone must be mad to think of\r\nputting into execution. We should be arrested next day, and convicted.\r\nBut I sought to calm myself with the reflection that my husband would\r\nshrink from the crime, that it would not take place, that it could\r\nnot. And yet, at the mere sight of him chatting with the President,\r\nI understood that his resolution remained as immutable as it was\r\nferocious.\r\n\r\n"Still, he was quite calm. He even talked merrily after his usual\r\nmanner; and it must have been in his intelligible look alone, which\r\never and anon rested on me, that I read his obstinate determination. He\r\nmeant to kill him a mile farther on, perhaps two, at the exact place\r\nhe had settled in his mind, and as to which I was in ignorance. This\r\nwas certain. One could even see it glittering in the tranquil glances\r\nwhich he cast upon the other who presently would be no more. I said\r\nnothing, feeling a violent interior trepidation, which I exerted myself\r\nto conceal by smiling when either of them looked at me. How was it that\r\nI never even thought of preventing all this? It was only later on, when\r\nI sought to understand my attitude, that I felt astonished I did not\r\nrun to the door and shout out, or that I did not pull the alarm bell.\r\nAt that time I was as if paralysed, I felt myself radically powerless.\r\nWhen I only think that I have not the courage to bleed a fowl! Oh! what\r\nI suffered on that hideous night! Oh! the frightful horror that howled\r\nwithin me!"\r\n\r\n"But tell me," said Jacques, "did you help him to kill the old fellow?"\r\n\r\n"I was in a corner," she continued without answering. "My husband sat\r\nbetween me and the President, who occupied the other corner. They\r\nchatted together about the forthcoming elections. From time to time I\r\nnoticed my husband bend forward, and cast a glance outside to find out\r\nwhere we were, as if impatient. Each time he acted thus, I followed\r\nhis eyes, and also ascertained how far we had travelled. The night was\r\nnot very dark, the black masses of trees could be seen filing past with\r\nfurious rapidity. And there was always that thunder of wheels, such as\r\nI had never heard before, a frightful tumult of enraged and moaning\r\nvoices, a lugubrious wail of animals howling at death! The train flew\r\nalong at full speed. Suddenly there came flashes of light, and the\r\nreverberating echo of the locomotive and carriages passing betwixt the\r\nbuildings of a station. We were at Maromme, already two leagues and a\r\nhalf from Rouen. Malaunay would be next, and then Barentin.\r\n\r\n"Where would the thing happen? Did he intend waiting until the last\r\nminute? I was no longer conscious of time or distances. I abandoned\r\nmyself like the stone that falls, to this deafening downfall in the\r\ngloom, when, on passing through Malaunay, I all at once understood: the\r\ndeed would be done in the tunnel, less than a mile farther on. I turned\r\ntowards my husband. Our eyes met: yes; in the tunnel. Two minutes\r\nmore. The train flew along. We passed the Dieppe embranchment, where\r\nI noticed the pointsman at his post. At this spot are some hills, and\r\nthere I imagined I could distinctly see men with their arms raised,\r\nloading us with imprecations. Then, the engine gave a long whistle. We\r\nwere at the entrance to the tunnel. And when the train plunged into it,\r\noh! how that low-vaulted roof resounded! You know, those sounds of an\r\nupheaval of iron, similar to a hammer striking on an anvil, and which\r\nI, in this second or two of craziness, transformed into the rumble of\r\nthunder."\r\n\r\nShe shivered, and broke off to say, in a voice that had changed, and\r\nwas almost merry:\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t it stupid, eh! darling, to still feel the cold in the marrow\r\nof one\'s bones? And yet, I\'m warm enough. Besides, you know there is\r\nnothing whatever to fear. The case is shelved, without counting that\r\nthe bigwigs connected with the government are even less anxious than\r\nourselves to throw light on it. Oh! I saw through it all, and am quite\r\nat ease!"\r\n\r\nThen she added, without seeking to conceal her merriment:\r\n\r\n"As for you, you can boast of having given us a rare fright! But tell\r\nme, I have often wondered--what was it you actually did see?"\r\n\r\n"What I told the magistrate, nothing more," he answered. "One man\r\nmurdering another. You two behaved so strangely with me that you\r\naroused my suspicions. At one moment I seemed to recognise your\r\nhusband. It was only later on though, that I became absolutely\r\ncertain----"\r\n\r\nShe gaily interrupted him:\r\n\r\n"Yes, in the square. The day when I told you no. Do you remember?\r\nThe first time we were alone in Paris together. How peculiar it was!\r\nI told you it was not us, and knew perfectly well that you thought\r\nthe contrary. It was as if I had told you all about it, was it not?\r\nOh! darling, I have often thought of that conversation, and I really\r\nbelieve it is since that day I love you."\r\n\r\nAfter a pause, she resumed the story of the crime:\r\n\r\n"The train flew through the tunnel, which is very long. It takes three\r\nminutes to reach the end, as you know. To me it seemed like an hour.\r\nThe President had ceased talking, in consequence of the deafening\r\nclatter of clashing iron. And my husband at this last moment must have\r\nlost courage, for he still remained motionless. Only, in the dancing\r\nlight of the lamp, I noticed his ears become violet. Was he going to\r\nwait until we were again in the open country? The crime seemed to me so\r\nfatally inevitable, that, henceforth, I had but one desire: to be no\r\nlonger subjected to this torture of waiting, to have it all over. Why\r\non earth did he not kill him, as the thing had to be done? I would have\r\ntaken the knife and settled the matter myself, I was so exasperated\r\nwith fear and suffering. He looked at me. No doubt he read my thoughts\r\non my face. For all of a sudden, he fell upon the President, who had\r\nturned to glance through the glass at the door, grasping him by the\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\n"M. Grandmorin, in a scare, instinctively shook himself free, and\r\nstretched out his arm towards the alarm knob just above his head. He\r\nmanaged to graze it, but was seized again by my husband, and thrown\r\ndown on the seat with such violence that he found himself doubled up.\r\nHis open mouth uttered frantic yells, in stupefaction and terror, which\r\nwere drowned in the uproar of the train; while I heard my husband\r\ndistinctly repeating the word: Beast! beast! beast! in a passionate\r\nhiss. But the noise subsided, the train left the tunnel, the pale\r\ncountry appeared once more with the dark trees filing past. I had\r\nremained stiffened in my corner, pressing against the back of the coup\xc3\xa9\r\nas far off as possible.\r\n\r\n"How long did the struggle last? Barely a few seconds. And yet it\r\nseemed to me it would never end, that all the passengers were now\r\nlistening to the cries, that the trees saw us. My husband, holding\r\nthe open knife in his hand, could not strike the blow, being driven\r\nback, staggering on the floor of the carriage, by the kicks of his\r\nvictim. He almost fell to his knees; and the train flew on, carrying us\r\nalong full speed; while the locomotive whistled as we approached the\r\nlevel-crossing at La Croix-de-Maufras.\r\n\r\n"Without me being able to recall afterwards how the thing occurred,\r\nI know it was then that I threw myself on the legs of the struggling\r\nman. Yes, I let myself fall like a bundle, crushing his two lower limbs\r\nwith all my weight, so that he was unable to move them any more. And\r\nif I saw nothing, I felt it all: the shock of the knife in the throat,\r\nthe long quivering of the body, and then death, which came with three\r\nhiccups, with a sound like the running-down of a broken clock. Oh!\r\nthat quivering fit of agony! I still feel the echo of it in my limbs!"\r\n\r\nJacques, eager for details, wanted to interrupt her with questions. But\r\nshe was now in a hurry to finish.\r\n\r\n"No; wait," said she. "As I rose from my seat we flashed past La\r\nCroix-de-Maufras. I distinctly perceived the front of the house with\r\nthe shutters closed, and then the box of the gatekeeper. Another three\r\nmiles, five minutes at the most, before reaching Barentin. The corpse\r\nwas doubled-up on the seat, the blood running from it forming a large\r\npool. And my husband, standing erect, besotted as if with drink,\r\nreeling in the swaying of the train, gazed on his victim as he wiped\r\nthe knife with his pocket handkerchief. This lasted a minute, without\r\neither of us doing anything for our safety. If we kept this corpse with\r\nus, if we remained there, everything perhaps would be discovered when\r\nthe train stopped at Barentin.\r\n\r\n"But my husband had put the knife in his pocket. He seemed to wake\r\nup. I saw him search the clothes of the dead man, take his watch, his\r\nmoney, all he could find; and, opening the door, he did his utmost to\r\nthrust the body out on the line without taking it in his arms, being\r\nafraid of the blood. \'Assist me,\' said he; \'push at the same time as I\r\ndo!\' I did not even attempt to try, my limbs were without feeling. With\r\nan oath he repeated, \'Will you push with me?\'\r\n\r\n"The head, which had gone out first, hung down to the step; while the\r\ntrunk, rolled into a ball, would not pass. And the train flew on. At\r\nlast, in response to a stronger effort, the corpse turned over, and\r\ndisappeared amidst the thunder of the wheels. \'Ah! the beast; so it is\r\nall over!\' said my husband. Then, picking up the rug, he threw that\r\nout as well. There were now only us two standing before the pool of\r\nblood on the seat, where we dare not sit down. The open door continued\r\nbeating backward and forward; and broken down and bewildered as I was,\r\nI did not at first understand what my husband was doing, when I saw\r\nhim get out, and in his turn disappear.\r\n\r\n"But he returned. \'Come, quick, follow me,\' said he, \'unless you\r\nwant them to cut our heads off!\' I did not move. He became impatient.\r\n\'Come on,\' he repeated with an oath, \'our compartment is empty.\' Our\r\ncompartment empty! Then he had been there? Was he quite certain that\r\nthe woman in black, who did not speak, whom one could not see, was he\r\nquite certain that she had not remained in a corner? \'If you don\'t\r\ncome, I\'ll throw you on the line like the other one!\' he threatened. He\r\nhad entered the carriage, and pushed me as a brute, half mad. I found\r\nmyself outside on the step, with my two hands clinging to the brass\r\nrail. Leaving the coup\xc3\xa9 after me, he carefully closed the door. \'Go on,\r\ngo on!\' said he. But I did not dare. I stood there, borne along in the\r\nwhirling flight of the train, beaten by the wind which was blowing a\r\ngale. My hair came unbound, and I thought my stiffened fingers would\r\nlose their hold on the rail. \'Go on!\' he exclaimed with another oath.\r\nHe continued pushing me, and I had to advance, hand over hand, keeping\r\nclose to the carriages, with my skirt and petticoats blowing about and\r\nembarrassing the action of my lower limbs. Already, in the distance,\r\nafter a curve, one could see the lights of the Barentin station. The\r\nengine began to whistle. \'Go on!\' repeated my husband still swearing at\r\nme.\r\n\r\n"Oh! that infernal riot, that violent vacillation amidst which I\r\nwalked! It seemed as if I had been caught in a storm that swept me\r\nalong like a straw, to cast me against a wall. The country flew behind\r\nmy back, the trees followed me in a furious gallop, turning over and\r\nover, twisted, each uttering a short moan as it passed. When I came\r\nto the end of the carriage, and had to take a stride to reach the\r\nfootboard of the next, and grasp the other rod, I stopped, having lost\r\nall courage. Never should I have the strength to do it. \'Go on,\' said\r\nmy husband, accompanying the words with his usual imprecation. He was\r\nbehind, he gave me a push, and I closed my eyes. I know not how it was\r\nI continued to advance. Possibly by the force of instinct, as an animal\r\nwho has planted his claws into something, and means not to fall. How\r\nwas it, too, that nobody saw us? We passed before three carriages, one\r\nof which was a second-class carriage, completely crammed. I remember\r\nseeing the heads of the passengers ranged in a line, in the light\r\nof the lamp. I believe I should recognise them if I were to meet\r\nthem one of these days. There was a stout man with red whiskers, and\r\nI particularly recollect two young girls who were leaning forward\r\nlaughing.\r\n\r\n"\'Go on! Go on!\' exclaimed my husband with two frightful oaths. And\r\nI hardly remember what followed. The lights at Barentin were drawing\r\nnear, the locomotive whistled. My last sensation was one of being\r\ndragged along, carried anyhow, caught up by the hair. My husband must\r\nhave grasped hold of me, opened the door over my shoulder, and thrown\r\nme into the compartment. I was reclining breathless and half fainting\r\nin a corner when we stopped; and, without making a movement, I heard my\r\nhusband exchange a few words with the station-master. Then, when the\r\ntrain went on again, he sank down on the seat, exhausted also. Between\r\nBarentin and Havre neither of us said a word. Oh! I hate him! I hate\r\nhim, for all those abominations he made me suffer!"\r\n\r\n"And so you sank down on his legs, and felt him dying?" inquired\r\nJacques.\r\n\r\nThe unknown was being revealed to him. A ferocious wave ascended from\r\nhis inside, filling his head with a crimson vision. His curiosity about\r\nthe murder returned.\r\n\r\n"And then, the knife, you felt the knife go in?" he continued.\r\n\r\n"Yes, with a thud," she answered.\r\n\r\n"Ah! a thud," said he, "not a rip; you are sure of that?"\r\n\r\n"No, no," she replied; "nothing but a shock."\r\n\r\n"And then, he quivered, eh?" he suggested.\r\n\r\n"Yes; he gave three twitches from top to toe, and they lasted so long\r\nthat I even felt them in his feet," she said.\r\n\r\n"And those twitches stiffened him, did they not?" he persisted.\r\n\r\n"Yes," she answered. "The first was very long, the other two weaker."\r\n\r\n"And then he died?" he continued. "And what effect did it have on you,\r\nwhen you felt him expire under the knife?"\r\n\r\n"On me? Oh! I don\'t know," she said.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t know! Why tell stories?" he asked her. "Describe to me,\r\ndescribe to me your feeling, quite frankly. Was it pain?"\r\n\r\n"No, no, not pain," said she.\r\n\r\n"Pleasure?" he inquired.\r\n\r\n"Pleasure!" she answered, "Ah! no, not pleasure!"\r\n\r\n"What then, my love?" he urged. "I implore you to tell me all. If you\r\nonly knew----Tell me what one feels."\r\n\r\n"Good heavens!" she exclaimed. "How is it possible to describe it? It\r\nis frightful. You are borne away. Oh! so far, so far! I lived longer in\r\nthat one minute than in all my previous life."\r\n\r\nThe crimson reflex had disappeared from the ceiling, and the fire\r\nhad died out. The room became cooler in the intense cold outside.\r\nNot a sound ascended from Paris, padded with snow. For a moment, the\r\nnewsvendor in the adjoining room, could be heard snoring, and then the\r\nwhole house subsided into complete silence. S\xc3\xa9verine had succumbed to\r\ninvincible slumber. The cuckoo clock had just struck three.\r\n\r\nJacques was unable to close his eyes, which a hand, invisible in the\r\nobscurity, seemed to keep open. He could now distinguish nothing in the\r\nroom. Every object had disappeared, stove, furniture, and walls. He had\r\nto turn round to find the two pale squares of windows, which appeared\r\nmotionless and faint as in a dream. Notwithstanding his excessive\r\nfatigue, prodigious cerebral activity kept him in a thrill, ceaselessly\r\nunwinding the same coil of ideas. Each time that, by an effort of will,\r\nhe fancied himself slipping off to sleep, the same haunting pictures\r\nbegan filing by again, awakening the same sensations.\r\n\r\nAnd the scene unfolded thus, with mechanical regularity, while his\r\nfixed, wide-open eyes became clouded, was that of the murder, detail\r\nby detail. It kept returning again and again, identically the same,\r\ngaining hold on him, driving him crazy. The knife entering the throat\r\nwith a thud, the body giving three long twitches, life ebbing away in a\r\nflood of warm blood--a crimson flood which he fancied he felt coursing\r\nover his hands. Twenty, thirty times, the knife went in, and the body\r\nquivered. Oh! if he could but deal a blow like that, satisfy his long\r\ncraving, learn what one experiences, become acquainted with that minute\r\nwhich is longer than a lifetime!\r\n\r\nIn spite of his effort to sleep, the invisible fingers kept his eyes\r\nopen; and in the darkness the murder scene reappeared in all its\r\nsanguinary traits. Then, he ceased the struggle and remained a prey to\r\nthe stubborn vision. He could hear within him the unfettered labour\r\nof the brain, the rumble of the whole machine. It came from long ago,\r\nfrom his youth. And yet he had fancied himself cured, for this desire\r\nto kill had been dead for months; but, since the story of that crime\r\nhad been told him just now, he had never felt the feeling so intensely.\r\nAn intolerable warmth ran up his spine, and at the back of the neck he\r\nfelt a pricking, as if red-hot needles were boring into him. He became\r\nafraid of his hands, and imprisoned them under him, as if he dreaded\r\nsome abomination on their part, some act that he was determined not to\r\nallow them to commit.\r\n\r\nEach time the cuckoo clock struck, Jacques counted the strokes. Four\r\no\'clock, five o\'clock, six o\'clock. He longed for daylight, in the\r\nhope that dawn would dispel this nightmare. And now, he turned towards\r\nthe windows, watching the panes of glass. But he could see naught save\r\nthe vague reflex of the snow. At a quarter to five he had heard the\r\nthrough train arrive from Havre, with a delay of only forty minutes\r\nwhich proved that the line must be clear. And it was not until after\r\nseven that he saw the window panes slowly becoming milky white. At\r\nlength the darkness in the apartment disappeared, to give place to an\r\nuncertain glimmer, in which the furniture looked as if floating. The\r\nstove, the cupboard, the sideboard reappeared. He was still unable to\r\nclose his lids. His eyes seemed determined to see.\r\n\r\nAll of a sudden, before it even became sufficiently light for him to\r\ndistinguish the object, he had guessed that the knife he had used to\r\ncut the cake the previous night lay on the table. He now saw nothing\r\nbut this knife, a small pointed weapon. And as day grew, all the clear\r\nrays from the two windows centred upon this thin blade. In terror of\r\nwhat his hands might do, he thrust them farther under him, for he could\r\nfeel that they were agitated, in open revolt, more powerful than his\r\nown will. Would they cease to belong to him, those hands that came\r\nfrom another, bequeathed to him by some ancestor of the days when man\r\nstrangled animals in the woods?\r\n\r\nSo as not to see the knife, Jacques turned towards S\xc3\xa9verine, who was\r\nsleeping very calmly in her intense fatigue, with the even respiration\r\nof a child. Her mass of unbound, black hair made her a sombre pillow,\r\nand spread over her shoulders. Beneath her chin, her throat appeared\r\namidst the curls, a throat of cream-like delicacy, faintly tinted with\r\nrose. He gazed at her, as if he did not know her. And yet he adored\r\nher, carrying her image along with him, impressed on his mind, wherever\r\nhe went. She was ever in his thoughts, even when he was driving his\r\nengine; and so much so, that on one occasion, when he awoke to\r\nreality, as from a dream, it was to find himself going at full speed\r\npast a station, in defiance of the signals.\r\n\r\nBut, at the sight of that white throat, he was overcome by a sudden,\r\ninexorable fascination; and, with a feeling of horror, of which he\r\nstill had conscience, he felt the imperious necessity rising within\r\nhim to take the knife from the table and bury it up to the handle in\r\nthe flesh of this woman. He heard the thud of the blade entering the\r\nthroat, he saw the body quake with three spasms, then stiffen in the\r\ndeath agony amidst a crimson flood.\r\n\r\nIn the struggle to free himself from these haunting thoughts, he\r\nevery second lost a little of his will. It seemed to be succumbing\r\nto the fixed idea, to be reaching that extremity when a man yields,\r\nvanquished, to the impulse of instinct. Everything went wrong. His\r\nrevolted hands, overcoming his effort to conceal them, became unclasped\r\nof themselves, and escaped. He then understood that, henceforth, he\r\nwas not their master, and that they would go, and brutally satisfy\r\nthemselves if he continued gazing at S\xc3\xa9verine.\r\n\r\nAlthough it was now broad daylight, the room appeared to him to be full\r\nof reddish smoke, as if it was a dawn of icy fog, drowning everything.\r\nHe shivered with fever. He had taken the knife, and concealed it up his\r\nsleeve, certain of killing one woman, the first he should meet on the\r\npavement outside, when a crumpling of linen, a prolonged sigh, made him\r\nturn pale and stop riveted beside the table. It was S\xc3\xa9verine waking up.\r\n\r\nHe felt convinced that if he approached her, with that knife in his\r\nsleeve, if he only saw her again, in all her delicate beauty, there\r\nwould be an end to that will which kept him firmly standing there close\r\nto her. In spite of himself, his hand would rise and bury the knife in\r\nher neck. Distracted, he opened the door, and fled.\r\n\r\nIt was eight o\'clock when Jacques found himself on the pavement of the\r\nRue d\'Amsterdam. The snow had not yet been removed, and the footsteps\r\nof the few passers-by could barely be heard. He immediately caught\r\nsight of an old woman, but, as she happened to be turning the corner of\r\nthe Rue de Londres, he did not follow her. Being among men he walked\r\ndown towards the Place du Havre, grasping the handle of the knife,\r\nwhose blade disappeared up his sleeve. As a girl about fourteen left a\r\nhouse opposite, he crossed the road, but only reached the other side to\r\nsee her enter the shop of a baker next door. His impatience was such\r\nthat he could not wait, but sought farther on, continuing to descend\r\nthe street.\r\n\r\nSince he had quitted the room with this knife, it was no longer he who\r\nacted, but the other one, him whom he had so frequently felt stirring\r\nin the depths of his being, that unknown party who dated back so very\r\nfar, who was burning with the hereditary thirst for murder. He had\r\nkilled in days of yore, he wanted to kill again.\r\n\r\nAnd the objects around Jacques were only things in a dream, for he\r\nsaw them in the light of his fixed idea. His everyday life was as if\r\nabolished. He strode along like a somnambulist, without memory of the\r\npast, without forethought for the future, a slave to his necessity. His\r\npersonality was absent from the body, which took its own direction.\r\n\r\nTwo women who brushed by, as they advanced ahead of him, caused him to\r\nhasten his step; and he had caught them up, when a man stopped them.\r\nAll three stood laughing and chatting together. This man being in his\r\nway, he began following another woman who went by, looking feeble and\r\ngloomy, and presenting a poverty-stricken appearance in her thin shawl.\r\nShe advanced with short steps, on her way, no doubt, to some execrated\r\ntask, that was hard and meanly remunerated, for she did not hurry, and\r\nher face looked despairingly sad.\r\n\r\nNor did he hurry, now that he had found a victim, but waited to select\r\na spot where he could strike her at ease. Probably she perceived him\r\nfollowing her, as her eyes turned towards him in unutterable distress,\r\nastonished that anybody could wish to have anything to say to her.\r\nShe had already led him to the middle of the Rue du Havre, where she\r\nturned round twice more, each time preventing him plunging the knife,\r\nwhich he drew from his sleeve, into her throat--her eyes looked so full\r\nof misery, and so supplicating! He would strike her down over there,\r\nas she stepped from the pavement. But, he abruptly turned aside, in\r\npursuit of another woman coming the opposite way. And he acted thus\r\nwithout reason, without will, simply because she happened to be passing\r\nat that minute.\r\n\r\nJacques followed her towards the station. This young woman was very\r\nlively, and walked with sonorous tread. She looked adorably pretty.\r\nShe could be no more than twenty, and was plump and fair, with lovely,\r\nmerry eyes that laughed at life. Apparently in a great hurry, she did\r\nnot even notice that a man was following her, but briskly ascended\r\nthe flight of steps in the Cour du Havre into the grand hall, along\r\nwhich she almost ran in her haste to reach the ticket-office of the\r\nCeinture line. And as she there asked for a first-class ticket to\r\nAuteuil, Jacques took the same. He then accompanied her through the\r\nwaiting-rooms, on to the platform, and seated himself beside her in the\r\ncompartment she selected. The train at once started.\r\n\r\n"I have plenty of time," thought he; "I\'ll kill her in a tunnel."\r\n\r\nBut opposite them, an elderly lady, the only other person there, had\r\njust recognised the young woman.\r\n\r\n"What! Is it you?" she exclaimed. "Where are you off to so early?"\r\n\r\nThe other laughed heartily with a comical gesture of despair.\r\n\r\n"Only fancy," said she, "one cannot go anywhere without meeting\r\nsomebody one knows! I hope you will not betray me. To-morrow is the\r\nbirthday of my husband; and, as soon as he went away to business,\r\nI set out on my errand. I am going to Auteuil to find a florist who\r\nhas an orchid which my husband has set his mind on. A surprise, you\r\nunderstand."\r\n\r\nThe elderly lady nodded her head up and down with tender benevolence.\r\n"And how is the baby?" she inquired.\r\n\r\n"The baby?" answered the young mother. "Oh! she is going on\r\nbeautifully. You know I weaned her a week ago. You should see\r\nher eating her pap. We are all remarkably well. It is perfectly\r\ndisgraceful."\r\n\r\nShe laughed louder than ever, displaying the white teeth between her\r\nruby lips. And Jacques, who had seated himself on her right, his knife\r\nin his fist, hidden under his leg, said to himself that he was in a\r\nfirst-rate position to deal the blow. He had only to raise his arm,\r\nand turn half round, to have her within reach. But in the Batignolles\r\ntunnel, the thought of something she wore round her neck stopped him.\r\n\r\n"There is a knot which will inconvenience me," he reflected. "I want to\r\nbe quite sure."\r\n\r\nThe two ladies continued chatting gaily together.\r\n\r\n"So I see you are happy," remarked the older one.\r\n\r\n"Happy? Ah! if I could only tell you to what extent," replied the\r\nother. "Two years ago I was nobody at all. You remember, there was no\r\namusement at the home of my aunt; and I was without a sou of dowry.\r\nWhen he used to call, I trembled, I had become so fond of him. He was\r\nso handsome, so wealthy. And he is mine, my husband, and we have baby\r\nbetween us. I assure you it is too delightful!"\r\n\r\nJacques, in examining the knot of the scarf, perceived a big gold\r\nlocket underneath, attached to a black velvet band; and he calculated\r\nhow he would proceed.\r\n\r\n"I will grasp her by the neck," thought he, "with my left hand, and\r\nthrust aside the locket as I put her head back to have the throat free."\r\n\r\nThe train stopped, and went on again every few minutes, the stations\r\nbeing so close together. Short tunnels followed one another at\r\nCourcelles and Neuilly. Presently would do, one minute would be\r\nsufficient.\r\n\r\n"Did you go to the seaside last summer?" inquired the old lady.\r\n\r\n"Yes," answered the other, "to Brittany, for six weeks, in an\r\nout-of-the-way corner, a perfect paradise. Then we passed September in\r\nPoitou, at the seat of my father-in-law, who owns extensive woods down\r\nthere."\r\n\r\n"And you are going to the south for the winter?" said the old lady.\r\n\r\n"Yes," answered the younger one, "we shall be at Cannes about the 15th.\r\nThe house is taken. A delightful bit of garden facing the sea. We have\r\nsent someone down to prepare the place. Neither of us fear the cold,\r\nbut then, the sun is so nice! We shall be back in March. Next year we\r\nintend to remain in Paris. After two years, when baby is big, we mean\r\nto travel. I hardly know what afterwards. It is one constant holiday!"\r\n\r\nShe was so overflowing with felicity, that yielding to a feeling of\r\nexpansion, she turned towards Jacques, towards this unknown individual\r\nto smile at him. In making this movement the knot of her scarf was\r\ndisplaced, carrying the locket away with it, and revealing the rosy\r\nneck with a slight dimple gilded by the shadow.\r\n\r\nThe fingers of Jacques clutched the handle of the knife, at the same\r\ntime as he formed an irrevocable resolution.\r\n\r\n"That is the spot where I will deal the blow," said he to himself.\r\n"Yes, in the tunnel before reaching Passy."\r\n\r\nBut, at the Trocadero station, a member of the staff got in, who,\r\nknowing Jacques, began to talk about a theft of coal that had been\r\nbrought home to a driver and his fireman. From that moment everything\r\nbecame confused. Later on he was never able to establish the facts,\r\nexactly. The laughter continued in such a beam of happiness that he\r\nfelt as if penetrated and appeased by it. Perhaps he went as far as\r\nAuteuil with the two ladies, only he had no recollection of seeing them\r\nleave the carriage.\r\n\r\nIn the end he found himself beside the Seine, without knowing how he\r\ncame there. But he had the distinct remembrance of casting the knife,\r\nwhich had remained in his hand, with the blade up his sleeve, from the\r\ntop of the bank into the river. Then he hardly knew what occurred,\r\nbeing half silly, absent from his being, which the other one had also\r\nleft along with the knife. He must have wandered about for hours\r\nthrough streets and squares, wherever his body chanced to take him.\r\nPeople and houses filed past very faintly. Doubtless, he had gone in\r\nsomewhere to get food at the end of a room full of customers, for he\r\nclearly recalled the white plates. He had also the firm impression that\r\nhe saw a red broadside on the shutters of a shop. And then, all sank\r\ninto a black chasm, to nothingness, where there was neither time nor\r\nspace, where he lay inert, perhaps since centuries.\r\n\r\nWhen Jacques came to himself, he was in his little room in the Rue\r\nCardinet. He had fallen across his bed in his clothes. Instinct had\r\ntaken him there, just as a lame dog drags himself to his kennel, or\r\nhis hole. He remembered neither going upstairs, nor going to sleep. He\r\nawoke from heavy slumber, scared to suddenly regain self-possession,\r\nas if after a long fainting fit. Perhaps he had slept three hours,\r\nperhaps three days. All at once his memory returned: the confession\r\nS\xc3\xa9verine had made of the murder, and his departure like a feline animal\r\nin search of blood. He had been beside himself, but he now had full\r\ncommand of his faculties, and felt astounded at what had taken place\r\nagainst his will. Then the recollection of the young woman awaiting\r\nhim, made him leap to his feet at a bound. He looked at his watch,\r\nand saw it was already four o\'clock; and, with a clear head, very\r\ncalm, as if after a copious bleeding, he hastened back to the Impasse\r\nd\'Amsterdam.\r\n\r\nS\xc3\xa9verine had been wrapped in profound slumber until noon. Then,\r\nwaking up, surprised not to see Jacques there, she had lit the fire,\r\nand, dying of inanition, had made up her mind, at about two o\'clock,\r\nto run down and get something to eat at a neighbouring restaurant.\r\nWhen Jacques appeared she had just come up again, after going on a few\r\nerrands.\r\n\r\n"Oh! my darling!" she exclaimed, as he entered the room; "I was most\r\nanxious!"\r\n\r\nAnd she hung round his neck, looking into his eyes, quite close.\r\n\r\n"What has happened?" she added inquiringly.\r\n\r\nHe placidly removed her fears, without feeling in the least troubled.\r\n\r\n"Oh! nothing," he replied, "a nasty job. When they once get hold of\r\nyou, they will never let you go."\r\n\r\nThen, S\xc3\xa9verine, lowering her voice, became very humble and fondling.\r\n\r\n"Only think," said she, "I fancied,--oh! an ugly thought, that caused\r\nme a great deal of pain!--Yes, I fancied to myself that perhaps after\r\nthe confession I made, you would have nothing more to do with me; and I\r\nimagined you had gone, never, never to return!"\r\n\r\nTears filled her eyes, and she burst into sobs, pressing him\r\ndistractedly in her arms.\r\n\r\n"Ah! my darling," she continued, "if you only knew how I yearn for\r\nkindness! Love me, love me fondly, because, you see, it is only your\r\nlove that can make me forget. Now that I have told you all my trouble,\r\nyou must not leave me. Oh! I implore you!"\r\n\r\nJacques felt penetrated by this tenderness. An invincible relaxation\r\nsoftened him little by little, and he stammered out:\r\n\r\n"No, no, I love you, do not be afraid."\r\n\r\nAnd quite overcome, he also wept, in face of the fatality of that\r\nabominable evil which had again taken hold of him, and of which he\r\nwould never be cured. It was shame, and despair without limit.\r\n\r\n"Love me, love me fondly, also," he continued. "Oh! with all your\r\nstrength, for I have as great a need of love as you."\r\n\r\nShe shuddered, and wished to know more.\r\n\r\n"If you are in grief, you must confide in me," said she.\r\n\r\n"No, no," he replied, "not grief, things that do not exist, moments of\r\nsadness that make me horribly unhappy, without it being even possible\r\nto speak of them."\r\n\r\nThey strained one another, mingling their frightfully melancholy\r\ntrouble. It was infinite suffering without any possible oblivion, and\r\nwithout pardon. They wept, and upon them they felt the blind force of\r\nlife, made up of struggles and death.\r\n\r\n"Come," said Jacques, disengaging himself, "it is time to think of\r\nleaving! To-night you will be at Havre!"\r\n\r\nS\xc3\xa9verine, with clouded brow and vacant eyes, murmured after a silence:\r\n\r\n"If I were only free, if my husband were no longer there. Ah! how soon\r\nwe should forget!"\r\n\r\nHe gave a violent gesture, and thinking aloud, he muttered:\r\n\r\n"Still we cannot kill him!"\r\n\r\nShe gazed at him fixedly, and he started, astonished at what he had\r\nsaid, for such an idea had never entered his mind. But as he wished to\r\nkill someone, why not kill this embarrassing man? And, as he left her\r\nto run to the dep\xc3\xb4t, she again clasped him in her arms, and smothered\r\nhim with kisses.\r\n\r\n"Oh! my darling," she repeated, "love me fondly. I will love you, more\r\nand more. We shall be happy, you will see."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the ensuing days at Havre, Jacques and S\xc3\xa9verine, who were\r\nalarmed, displayed great prudence. As Roubaud knew all, would he not\r\nbe on the watch to surprise and wreak vengeance on them in a burst\r\nof rage? They recalled his previous angry fits of jealousy, his\r\nbrutalities of a former porter, when he struck out with his clenched\r\nfists; and now, observing him so sour, so mute, with his troubled\r\neyes, they imagined he must be meditating some savage, cunning trick,\r\nsome stealthy snare to get them in his clutches. So, for the first few\r\nmonths, they were ever on the alert, and in meeting one another took\r\nall kinds of precautions.\r\n\r\nStill Roubaud absented himself more and more. Perhaps, he merely\r\ndisappeared for the purpose of returning unexpectedly to find them\r\ntogether. But this fear proved groundless. His spells of absence became\r\nso prolonged that he was never at home, running off as soon as he\r\nbecame free, and only returning at the precise minute when the service\r\nclaimed him. During the weeks he was on day duty, he managed to get\r\nthrough his ten o\'clock knife-and-fork breakfast in five minutes, and\r\nwas not seen again before half-past eleven; and at five o\'clock in the\r\nevening, when his colleague came down to relieve him, he slipped away\r\nagain, often to remain out the whole night. He barely allowed himself\r\na few hours\' sleep. His behaviour was similar during the weeks he did\r\nnight duty. Free at five o\'clock in the morning, he no doubt ate and\r\nslept in the town, as he did not return until five o\'clock in the\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this disorderly mode of life, he for a long time\r\nmaintained exemplary punctuality, being invariably at his post at the\r\nexact minute, although he was sometimes so worn out that he could\r\nhardly keep on his feet. Still he was there, and conscientiously went\r\nthrough his work. Now came interruptions. Moulin, the other assistant\r\nstation-master, had twice waited an hour for him; and one morning after\r\nbreakfast, finding he had not returned, he had even in good fellowship\r\nsought him out, to save him from a reprimand. All the duty Roubaud had\r\nto perform suffered from this slow course of disorganisation.\r\n\r\nIn the daytime he was no longer the same active man who, when a train\r\nwent off or came in, examined everything with his own eyes, noting down\r\nthe smallest details in his report to his chief, as hard for himself\r\nas for those under him. At night, he slept like a top in the great\r\narmchair in the office. When awake he seemed still sleeping, going and\r\ncoming along the platform with hands behind his back, giving orders\r\nwithout emphasis, and without verifying their execution. Nevertheless,\r\nthe work went on satisfactorily, apart from a slight collision, due to\r\nhis negligence in sending a passenger train on to a shunting-line. His\r\ncolleagues merely laughed, contenting themselves with saying that he\r\nwent on the spree.\r\n\r\nThe truth was that Roubaud, at present, passed all his spare time\r\nin a small, out-of-the-way room on the first floor of the Caf\xc3\xa9 du\r\nCommerce, which little by little had become a gambling-place. It was\r\nthere the assistant station-master satisfied that morbid passion for\r\nplay which had commenced on the morrow of the murder through a chance\r\ngame at piquet, to increase afterwards and become a firmly rooted\r\nhabit, owing to the absolute diversion and oblivion it afforded.\r\nHenceforth, the gambling mania had a firm grip on him, as if it was\r\nthe sole gratification in which he found contentment. Not that he had\r\never been tormented through remorse with a desire to forget, but amidst\r\nthe upheaval at home, amidst his shipwrecked existence, he had found\r\nconsolation in the diverting influence of this egotistic pleasure,\r\nwhich he could enjoy alone; everything was obliterated by this passion\r\nwhich completed his disorganisation.\r\n\r\nAlcohol could not have brought him lighter or swifter moments, so free\r\nfrom every anxiety. He had even released himself from the care of life.\r\nHe seemed to live with extraordinary, but disinterested intensity,\r\nwithout being touched by any of those annoyances that formerly made\r\nhim burst with rage. And, apart from the fatigue of sitting-up all\r\nnight, he enjoyed very good health. He even put on fat, a heavy yellow\r\nkind of fat, and his lids hung wearily above his troubled eyes. When\r\nhe went home with his slow, sleepy gestures, it was to display supreme\r\nindifference for everything.\r\n\r\nOn the night that Roubaud returned to his lodgings to take the 300\r\nfrcs. in gold from under the parquetry, he wanted to pay M. Cauche, the\r\ncommissary of police at the station, several successive losses he had\r\nmade. Cauche, who was an old gambler, showed magnificent composure,\r\nwhich rendered him redoubtable. Compelled by his duties to keep up the\r\nappearances of an old military man, who, having remained bachelor,\r\nspent all his time at the caf\xc3\xa9 as a quiet, regular customer, he averred\r\nthat he only played for pleasure; which did not prevent him passing\r\nthe whole night at cards and pocketing all the money of the others.\r\nRumours had got abroad that, owing to his inexactitude in the discharge\r\nof his functions, it had become a question of forcing him to resign.\r\nBut matters dragged on, and there being so little to do, it seemed\r\nunnecessary to exact greater zeal. So he continued to confine himself\r\nto appearing for an instant on the platform of the station, where\r\neveryone bowed to him.\r\n\r\nThree weeks after the payment of the first debt, Roubaud owed nearly\r\nanother 400 frcs. to M. Cauche. He explained that the legacy to his\r\nwife put them quite at their ease; but he added, with a laugh, that she\r\nkept the keys of the safe, which explained his delay in discharging his\r\ngambling liabilities. Then, one morning, when alone and tormented, he\r\nagain raised the piece of parquetry, and took a 1000-franc-note from\r\nthe hiding-place. He trembled in all his limbs. He had not experienced\r\nsuch emotion on the night he helped himself to the gold. Doubtless, in\r\nhis mind, that was only odd change come across by chance, whereas the\r\ntheft began with this note. It made his flesh creep when he thought of\r\nthis sacred money, which he had vowed never to touch.\r\n\r\nFormerly he had sworn he would sooner die of hunger, and yet he\r\ntouched it, and he could not explain how he had got rid of his\r\nscruples. Doubtless he had lost a portion of them day by day in the\r\nslow fermentation of the murder. At the bottom of the hole he fancied\r\nhe felt something damp, something flabby and nauseous, which gave him\r\nhorror. Quickly replacing the piece of parquetry, he once more swore\r\nthat he would cut off his hand rather than remove it again. His wife\r\nhad not seen him. He drew a breath of relief, and drank a large glass\r\nfull of water to compose himself. Now his heart beat with delight at\r\nthe idea of his debt being paid, and of all this sum he would be able\r\nto risk on the gambling-table.\r\n\r\nBut when it became a question of changing the note, the vexations\r\nof Roubaud began again. Formerly he was brave, he would have given\r\nhimself up had he not committed the folly of involving his wife in the\r\nbusiness; while now the mere thought of the gendarmes made him shiver.\r\nIt served him but little to know that the judicial authorities were\r\nnot in possession of the numbers of the notes that had disappeared, and\r\nthat the criminal proceedings were at rest, shelved for ever in the\r\ncardboard boxes; as soon as he formed the project of going somewhere to\r\nask for change, he was seized with terror.\r\n\r\nFor five days he kept the note about him, and got into the habit of\r\nconstantly touching it, of changing its place, of even keeping it with\r\nhim at night. He built up some very complicated plans, but always to\r\nencounter unforeseen apprehensions. At first he thought of getting rid\r\nof it at the station: why should not a colleague in charge of one of\r\nthe paying-in offices take it from him? Then, when this struck him as\r\nextremely dangerous, he conceived the idea of going to the other end\r\nof Havre without his uniform cap, to purchase the first thing that\r\nentered his head. Only, would not the shopman be astonished to see him\r\noffer such a big note in payment of so small a purchase? And he had\r\nthen made up his mind to present the note at the shop of a tobacconist\r\non the Cours Napol\xc3\xa9on, where he went daily. Would this not be the most\r\nsimple course of all? It was known he had inherited the legacy, and the\r\nshopkeeper could not be surprised.\r\n\r\nHe walked to the door, but feeling himself falter he went down to the\r\nVauban dock to muster up courage. After walking about for half an hour,\r\nhe returned without yet being able to do as he had decided. But in the\r\nevening, at the Caf\xc3\xa9 du Commerce, as M. Cauche happened to be there,\r\na sudden feeling of bravado made him pull the note from his pocket\r\nand beg the hostess to change it; but as she did not happen to have\r\nsufficient gold, she had to send a waiter to the tobacco shop. Everyone\r\nmade fun about the note, which seemed quite new, although dated ten\r\nyears back. The commissary of police, taking it in his hand, turned it\r\nover and over, with the remark that it must certainly have been lying\r\nin some out-of-the-way place, which made another person relate an\r\ninterminable story about a hidden fortune being discovered under the\r\nmarble top of a chest of drawers.\r\n\r\nWeeks passed, and this money which Roubaud had in his hands sufficed\r\nto send his passion to fever heat. It was not that he played for high\r\nstakes, but he was pursued by such constant dismal bad luck that the\r\nsmall daily losses, added together, totalled up to a large amount.\r\nTowards the end of the month he found himself without a sou, besides\r\nbeing a few louis in debt, and so ill that he hardly dared touch a\r\ncard. Nevertheless, he struggled on, and almost had to take to his\r\nbed. The idea of the nine notes remaining there under the floor of\r\nthe dining-room preyed on his mind at every minute. He could see them\r\nthrough the wood, he felt them heating the soles of his boots. If he\r\nchose he could take another! But this time he had formally sworn he\r\nwould rather thrust his hand in the fire than rummage there again. But\r\none night, when S\xc3\xa9verine had gone to bed early, he again raised the\r\npiece of parquetry, yielding with rage and distracted with such grief\r\nthat his eyes filled with tears. What was the use of resisting thus? It\r\nwas only needless suffering, for he could see that he would now take\r\nall the notes, one by one, until the last.\r\n\r\nNext morning S\xc3\xa9verine chanced to notice a chip, quite fresh, at the\r\nspot where the treasure lay concealed. Stooping down, she found the\r\ntrace of a dent. Her husband evidently continued taking money, and she\r\nwas astonished at the anger that got the better of her, for as a rule\r\nshe was not grasping; and besides, she also fancied herself resolved\r\nto die of hunger rather than touch one of those blood-stained notes.\r\nBut did they not belong to her as much as to him? Why should he avoid\r\nconsulting her and dispose of them on the sly? Until dinner-time she\r\nwas tormented by the desire to be positive, and she would in her turn\r\nhave taken up the parquetry to look, had she not felt a little cold\r\nshiver in her hair at the thought of searching there all alone.\r\nWould not the dead rise from this hole? This childish fear made the\r\ndining-room seem so unpleasant that she took her work and shut herself\r\nup in her bedroom.\r\n\r\nThen, in the evening, as the two were silently eating the remains of a\r\nstew, she again became irritated at seeing him cast involuntary glances\r\nat the spot where the money was hidden.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve been helping yourself to some more?" she said interrogatively.\r\n\r\nHe raised his head in astonishment.\r\n\r\n"Some more what?" he inquired.\r\n\r\n"Oh! do not act the innocent," she continued; "you understand very\r\nwell. But listen: I will not have you do it again, because it is no\r\nmore yours than mine, and it upsets me to know that you touch it."\r\n\r\nHabitually he avoided quarrels. Their life in common had become the\r\nmere obligatory contact of two beings bound one to the other, passing\r\nentire days without exchanging a word; and, henceforth, going and\r\ncoming like indifferent and solitary strangers. So he refused to give\r\nany explanation, and contented himself with shrugging his shoulders.\r\n\r\nBut she became very excited. She meant to finish with the matter, with\r\nthe question of this money hidden there, which had made her suffer\r\nsince the day of the crime.\r\n\r\n"I insist on you answering me!" she exclaimed. "Dare to say that you\r\nhave not touched it!"\r\n\r\n"What does it matter to you?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"It matters to me, this much," she replied,--"that it makes me ill.\r\nAgain to-day I was afraid. I could not remain here. Every time you go\r\nto that place I have horrible dreams three nights in succession. We\r\nnever mention the subject. Then remain quiet, and do not force me to\r\nspeak about it."\r\n\r\nHe contemplated her with his great staring eyes, and repeated in a\r\nweighty tone:\r\n\r\n"What does it matter to you if I touch it, so long as I do not force\r\nyou to do so? It is my own business, and concerns me alone!"\r\n\r\nShe was about to make a violent gesture, which she repressed. Then,\r\nquite upset, with a countenance full of suffering and disgust, she\r\nexclaimed:\r\n\r\n"Ah! indeed! I do not understand you! And yet you were an honest man.\r\nYes, you would never have taken a sou from anyone. And what you did\r\nmight have been forgiven, for you were crazy, and made me the same.\r\nBut this money! Ah! this abominable money! which should not exist for\r\nyou, and which you are stealing sou by sou for your pleasure. What has\r\nhappened? How could you have fallen so low?"\r\n\r\nHe listened to her, and in a moment of lucidity he also felt\r\nastonished that he should have arrived at thieving. The phases of the\r\nslow demoralisation were becoming effaced, he was unable to re-join\r\nwhat the murder had severed around him, he failed to understand how\r\nanother existence, how almost a new being had commenced, with his home\r\ndestroyed, his wife standing aside, and hostile. But the unavoidable\r\nsubject at once came uppermost in his mind. He gave a gesture, as if to\r\nfree himself from troublesome reflections, and growled:\r\n\r\n"When there is no pleasure at home, one seeks diversion outside. As you\r\nno longer love me----"\r\n\r\n"Oh! no, I have no more love for you," she interrupted.\r\n\r\nHe looked at her, gave a blow with his fist on the table, and the blood\r\nrushed to his face.\r\n\r\n"Then leave me alone!" he exclaimed. "Do I interfere with your\r\namusements? Do I sit in judgment on you? There are many things an\r\nupright man would do in my place, and which I do not do! To begin with,\r\nI ought to kick you out at the door. After that I should perhaps not\r\nsteal."\r\n\r\nShe had become quite pale, for she also had often thought that when\r\na man, and particularly a jealous man, is ravaged by some internal\r\nevil to the point of allowing his wife a sweetheart, there exists an\r\nindication of moral gangrene invading his being, destroying the other\r\nscruples, and entirely disorganising his conscience. But she struggled\r\ninwardly, refusing to hold herself responsible, and in an unsteady\r\nvoice she exclaimed:\r\n\r\n"I forbid you to touch the money!"\r\n\r\nHe had finished eating, and, quietly folding up his napkin, he rose,\r\nsaying in a bantering tone:\r\n\r\n"If you want to share the cash, let us do so."\r\n\r\nHe was already bending down as if to take up the piece of parquetry,\r\nand she had to rush forward and place her foot on it.\r\n\r\n"No, no!" she pleaded. "You know I would prefer death. Do not open it.\r\nNo, no! not before me!"\r\n\r\nThat same night S\xc3\xa9verine had an appointment with Jacques behind the\r\ngoods station. When she returned home after twelve o\'clock, the scene\r\nwith her husband in the evening recurred to her, and she double-locked\r\nherself in her bedroom. Roubaud was on night duty, and she had no\r\nanxiety lest he should return and come to bed, a circumstance that\r\nvery rarely happened, even when he had his nights to himself. But with\r\nbedclothes to her chin, and the lamp turned down, she failed to get to\r\nsleep. Why had she refused to share?\r\n\r\nAnd she found that her ideas of honesty were not so keen as before, at\r\nthe thought of taking advantage of this money. Had she not accepted\r\nthe legacy of La Croix-de-Maufras? Then she could very well take the\r\nmoney also. Now the shivering fit returned. No, no, never! Money she\r\nwould have taken. What she dared not touch, without fear of literally\r\nburning her fingers, was this money stolen from a dead body, this\r\nabominable money of the murder! She again recovered calm, and reasoned\r\nwith herself: if she had taken the money, it would not have been to\r\nspend it; on the contrary, she would have hidden it somewhere else,\r\nburied it in a place known to her alone, where it would have remained\r\neternally; and, at this hour even, half the amount would still be saved\r\nfrom the hands of her husband. He would not enjoy the triumph of having\r\nit all, he would not be able to gamble away what belonged to her.\r\n\r\nWhen the clock struck three she felt mortally sorry that she had\r\nrefused to share. A thought, indeed, came to her, still confused, and\r\nfar from being determined on: supposing she were to get up, and search\r\nbeneath the parquetry, so that he might have nothing more. Only she\r\nwas seized with such icy coldness that she would not dream of it. Take\r\nall, keep all, without him daring to complain! And this plan, little by\r\nlittle, gained on her; while a will stronger than her resistance arose\r\nfrom the unconscious depths of her being. She would not do it; and yet\r\nshe abruptly leapt from the bed, for she could not restrain herself.\r\nTurning up the lamp, she passed into the dining-room.\r\n\r\nFrom that moment S\xc3\xa9verine ceased trembling. Her terror left her,\r\nand she proceeded calmly, with the slow and precise gestures of a\r\nsomnambulist. She had to fetch the poker, which served to raise the\r\npiece of parquetry, and failing to see when the hole was uncovered, she\r\nbrought the lamp near it. But then, bending forward, motionless, she\r\nbecame riveted to the spot in stupor: the hole was empty. It appeared\r\nevident, that while she had gone to her appointment with Jacques,\r\nRoubaud had returned, tormented by the same desire as herself to take\r\nall and keep all, a desire that had come to him before attacking her;\r\nand at one stroke he had pocketed all the banknotes that were left. Not\r\na single one remained. She knelt down, but only perceived the watch and\r\nchain at the back of the hiding-place, where the gold sparkled in the\r\ndust of the joists. Frigid rage kept her there an instant, rigid and\r\nhalf nude, repeating aloud, a score of times over:\r\n\r\n"Thief! thief! thief!"\r\n\r\nThen, with a furious movement, she grasped the watch, while a great\r\nblack spider, which she had disturbed, fled along the plaster.\r\nReplacing the piece of parquetry with blows from her heel, she returned\r\nto bed, standing the lamp on the night-table. When she had become warm,\r\nshe looked at the watch which she held in her hand, turning it over\r\nand examining it for a long time. The two initials of the President,\r\ninterlaced on the back of the case, interested her. Inside, she read\r\nthe number of the manufacturer, 2516. It was a very dangerous piece of\r\njewelry to keep, for the judicial authorities knew the number. But, in\r\nher anger at being unable to save anything but this, she had no fear.\r\nShe even felt there would be an end to her nightmares, now that the\r\nskeleton had disappeared from under the floor. At last she would be\r\nable to tread at home in peace, wherever she pleased. So, slipping the\r\nwatch beneath her pillow, she turned out the lamp and fell asleep.\r\n\r\nNext day Jacques, who was free, had to wait until Roubaud had settled\r\ndown at the Caf\xc3\xa9 du Commerce in accordance with his habit, to run up\r\nand lunch with S\xc3\xa9verine. Occasionally, when they dared, they treated\r\nthemselves to these little diversions. And on that day, as she was\r\neating, still all of a tremble, she spoke to him about the money,\r\nrelating how she had found the hiding-place empty. Her rancour against\r\nher husband was not appeased, and the words she had used the previous\r\nnight came incessantly to her lips:\r\n\r\n"Thief! thief! thief!"\r\n\r\nThen she brought the watch, and insisted on giving it to Jacques in\r\nspite of his repugnance to take it.\r\n\r\n"But you see, my darling," she said, "no one will ever think of\r\nsearching for the thing at your place. If it remains with me, he will\r\nget possession of it. And rather than that should happen I would let\r\nhim tear me to pieces. No, he has had too much already. I did not want\r\nthe money; it gave me horror. I would never have spent a sou of it. But\r\nhad he the right to take it? Oh! I hate him!"\r\n\r\nShe was in tears, and persisted with so many supplications, that\r\nJacques ended by placing the watch in his waistcoat pocket.\r\n\r\nAn hour had passed when Roubaud, who had his own key, opened the door\r\nand stepped in. She was at once on her feet, while Roubaud stopped\r\nshort, and Jacques, who was stupefied, remained seated. S\xc3\xa9verine,\r\nwithout troubling to give any sort of explanation, advanced towards her\r\nhusband, and passionately repeated:\r\n\r\n"Thief! thief! thief!"\r\n\r\nRoubaud hesitated for a second. Then, with that shrug of the shoulders,\r\nwhich served to brush everything aside now, he entered the bedroom\r\nand picked up a note-book connected with the railway, which he had\r\nforgotten. But she followed him, giving free play to her tongue.\r\n\r\n"You have been there again," she said. "Dare to deny that you have been\r\nthere again! And you have taken it all! Thief! thief! thief!"\r\n\r\nHe crossed the dining-room without a word. It was only at the door that\r\nhe turned round to embrace her in his leaden glance, and say:\r\n\r\n"Just let me have peace, eh!"\r\n\r\nHe was gone, and the door did not even bang. He appeared not to have\r\nseen, and made no allusion to the sweetheart seated there.\r\n\r\nFrom that day S\xc3\xa9verine and Jacques enjoyed perfect freedom, without\r\ntroubling any further about Roubaud. But if the husband ceased to cause\r\nthem anxiety, it was not the same with the eavesdropping of Madame\r\nLebleu, the neighbour ever on the watch. She certainly had the idea\r\nthat something irregular was going on. Jacques might well muffle the\r\nsound of his footsteps. At each visit he noticed the opposite door\r\nimperceptibly come ajar, and an eye staring at him through the chink.\r\nIt became intolerable. He no longer dared ascend the staircase; for\r\nif he ran the risk, she knew he was there; and her ear went to the\r\nkeyhole, so that it became impossible to take a kiss, or even to\r\nconverse at liberty.\r\n\r\nIt was then that S\xc3\xa9verine, in exasperation, resumed her former campaign\r\nagainst the Lebleus, to gain possession of their lodging. It was\r\nnotorious that an assistant station-master had always lived there. But\r\nit was not now for the superb view afforded by the windows opening\r\non the courtyard at the entrance, and stretching to the heights of\r\nIngouville, that she desired it; her sole motive, anent which she\r\nnever breathed a word, was that the lodging had a second entry--a door\r\nopening on a back staircase. Jacques could come up and go out that way\r\nwithout Madame Lebleu having even a suspicion of his visits. At last\r\nthey would be free.\r\n\r\nThe battle was terrible. This question, which had already impassioned\r\nall the corridor, began afresh, and became envenomed from hour to\r\nhour. Madame Lebleu, in presence of the menace, desperately defended\r\nherself, convinced in her own mind that she would die if shut up in\r\nthe dark lodging at the back, with the view barred by the roofing of\r\nthe marquee, and as sad as a prison. How could she live in that black\r\nhole--she, who was accustomed to her beautifully bright room opening on\r\nthe vast expanse of country, enlivened by the constant coming and going\r\nof travellers? And the state of her lower limbs preventing her going\r\nout for a walk, she would never have aught but the zinc roof to gaze\r\nupon; she might just as well be killed straight off.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately these were mere sentimental reasons, and she was\r\nforced to own that she held the lodging from the former assistant\r\nstation-master, predecessor of Roubaud, who, being a bachelor, had\r\nceded it to her from motives of courtesy; and it appeared that there\r\neven existed a letter from her husband, undertaking to vacate the\r\nrooms should any future assistant station-master claim them; but as\r\nthe letter had not yet been found, she denied that it had ever been\r\nwritten. In proportion as her case suffered, she became more violent\r\nand aggressive. At one moment she had sought to involve the wife of\r\nMoulin, the other assistant station-master, in the business, and so\r\ngain her over to her side by saying that this lady had seen men kiss\r\nMadame Roubaud on the stairs. Thereupon Moulin became angry; for his\r\nwife, a very gentle and insignificant creature, whom no one ever saw,\r\nvowed, in tears, that she had neither seen nor said anything.\r\n\r\nFor a week all this tittle-tattle swept like a tempest, from one end of\r\nthe corridor to the other. But the cardinal mistake of Madame Lebleu,\r\nand the one destined to bring about her defeat, consisted in constantly\r\nirritating Mademoiselle Guichon, the office-keeper, by obstinately\r\nspying on her. It was a mania on the part of Madame Lebleu, a firm\r\nconviction, that this spinster was carrying on an intrigue with the\r\nstation-master. And her anxiety to surprise them had become a malady,\r\nwhich was all the more intense as she had had her eye on them for three\r\nyears, without surprising anything whatever, not even a breath.\r\n\r\nSo Mademoiselle Guichon, furious that she could neither go out nor come\r\nin without being watched, now exerted herself to have Madame Lebleu\r\nrelegated to the back; a lodging would then separate them, and anyhow,\r\nshe would no longer have her opposite, nor be obliged to pass before\r\nher door. Moreover, it was evident that M. Dabadie, the station-master,\r\nwho hitherto had avoided meddling in the struggle, was becoming more\r\nand more unfavourable to the Lebleus every day, which was a grave sign.\r\n\r\nBesides, the situation became complicated by quarrels. Philom\xc3\xa8ne, who\r\nnow brought her new-laid eggs to S\xc3\xa9verine, displayed great insolence\r\nevery time she ran across Madame Lebleu; and as the latter purposely\r\nleft her door open, so as to annoy everybody, spiteful remarks were\r\ncontinually being exchanged between the two women.\r\n\r\nThis intimacy of S\xc3\xa9verine and Philom\xc3\xa8ne having drifted into\r\nconfidences, the latter had ended by taking messages from Jacques to\r\nhis sweetheart when he did not dare run upstairs himself. Arriving with\r\nher eggs, she altered the appointments, said why he had been obliged to\r\nbe prudent on the previous evening, and related how long he had stayed\r\nat her house in conversation. Jacques, at times, when an obstacle\r\nprevented him meeting S\xc3\xa9verine, found no displeasure in passing his\r\ntime in this way at the cottage of Sauvagnat, the head of the engine\r\ndep\xc3\xb4t. He accompanied Pecqueux, his fireman, there, as if for the\r\npurpose of distraction, for he dreaded staying a whole evening alone.\r\nBut when the fireman disappeared, to go from one to another of the\r\ndrinking resorts frequented by sailors, he called on Philom\xc3\xa8ne alone,\r\nentrusted her with a message, then, seating himself, he remained there\r\nsome time. And she, becoming little by little mixed-up in this love\r\naffair, began to be smitten. The small hands and polite manners of this\r\nsad lover seemed to her delightful.\r\n\r\nOne evening she unbosomed herself to him, complaining of the fireman,\r\nan artful fellow, said she, notwithstanding his jovial manner, quite\r\ncapable of dealing a nasty blow when intoxicated. Jacques noticed that\r\nshe now paid more attention to her personal appearance, drank less,\r\nand kept the house cleaner. Her brother Sauvagnat, having one night\r\noverheard a male voice in the room, entered with his hand raised ready\r\nto strike; but recognising the visitor talking to her, he contented\r\nhimself with uncorking a bottle of cider. Jacques, who was well\r\nreceived, shook off his fainting fits, and apparently amused himself.\r\nPhilom\xc3\xa8ne, for her part, displayed warmer and warmer friendship for\r\nS\xc3\xa9verine, and made no secret of her feelings for Madame Lebleu, whom\r\nshe alluded to everywhere as an old hag.\r\n\r\nOne night, meeting the two sweethearts at the back of her garden, she\r\naccompanied them in the dark to the shed, where they usually concealed\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n"Ah! well," said she, "it is too good of you. As the lodging is yours,\r\nI would drag her out of it by the hair of her head. Give her a good\r\nhiding!"\r\n\r\nBut Jacques was opposed to a scandal.\r\n\r\n"No, no," he broke in, "M. Dabadie has the matter in hand. It will be\r\nbetter to wait until it can be properly settled."\r\n\r\n"Before the end of the month," affirmed S\xc3\xa9verine, "I mean to sleep in\r\nher room, and we shall then be able to see one another whenever we\r\nplease."\r\n\r\nPhilom\xc3\xa8ne left them to return home, but, hidden in the shadow a few\r\npaces away, she paused and faced round. She felt considerable emotion\r\nat the knowledge that they were together. Still, she was not jealous;\r\nshe simply felt the need of loving and of being loved in this same way.\r\n\r\nJacques became more and more gloomy every day. On two occasions when\r\nhe could have met S\xc3\xa9verine, he invented excuses not to do so, and\r\nsometimes when he remained late at the cottage of the Sauvagnats, it\r\nwas also for the purpose of avoiding her. Nevertheless, he still loved\r\nher. But now the frightful evil had returned. He suffered from terrible\r\nswimming in the head, he turned icy cold. In terror, he perceived he\r\nwas no longer himself, and that the animal was there ready to bite.\r\n\r\nHe sought relief in the fatigue of long journeys, soliciting additional\r\nwork, remaining twelve hours at a stretch erect on his engine, his body\r\nracked by the vacillation, his lungs scorched by the wind. His comrades\r\ncomplained of this hard life of a driver, which did for a man, said\r\nthey, in a score of years. He would have liked to be done for at once.\r\nHe was never sufficiently tired. Never did he feel so happy as when\r\nborne along by La Lison, thinking no more, and with eyes only for the\r\nsignals. On reaching the end of the run sleep overpowered him, before\r\nhe had even time to wash. Only, when he awoke, the torment of the fixed\r\nidea returned.\r\n\r\nHe had also endeavoured to resume his former affection for La Lison.\r\nAgain he passed hours cleaning it, exacting from Pecqueux that the\r\nsteel should shine like silver. The inspectors who got up beside\r\nhim on the way, paid him compliments. But he only shook his head in\r\ndissatisfaction, for, he knew very well, that since the stoppage in\r\nthe snow, it was not the same efficient, valiant engine as formerly.\r\nDoubtless, in the repairs to the pistons and slide-valves, it had lost\r\nsome of its principal motive power--that mysterious equilibrium, due to\r\nthe hazard of building. This decay caused him suffering which turned to\r\nbitter vexation, and to such a pitch that he pursued his superiors with\r\nunreasonable complaints, asking for unnecessary repairs, and suggesting\r\nimprovements that were impracticable. These being refused, he became\r\nmore gloomy, convinced that La Lison was out of order, and that\r\nhenceforth he could do nothing decent with the engine. His affection in\r\nconsequence became discouraged; what was the good of loving anything,\r\nas he would kill all he loved?\r\n\r\nS\xc3\xa9verine had not failed to observe the change, and she was grieved,\r\nthinking his sadness due to her, since he knew all. When she perceived\r\nhim shudder on her neck, avoid her kiss by abruptly drawing back, was\r\nit not because he remembered, and she caused him horror? Never had she\r\ndared resume the conversation on the subject. She repented of having\r\nspoken, and was surprised at the way her confession had burst from her.\r\nAs if satisfied at present to have him with her, at the bottom of this\r\nsecret, she forgot how long she had felt the need to confide in him.\r\nShe loved him more passionately since he knew everything. She only\r\nlived for Jacques, and her one dream was that he might carry her away\r\nand keep her with him.\r\n\r\nOf the hideous drama she had merely retained the astonishment of\r\nbeing mixed up in it, and she would not even have felt angry with her\r\nhusband, had he not been in her way. But her execration for this man\r\nincreased in proportion with her passion for the other. Now that her\r\nhusband was aware of her intrigue and had absolved her, the sweetheart\r\nwas the master, the one she would follow, and who could dispose of her\r\nas he pleased. She had made him give her his portrait, and she took it\r\nto bed with her, falling asleep with her lips glued to the image. And\r\nshe felt very much pained since she saw him unhappy, without being able\r\nto exactly understand what caused him such suffering.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, they continued to meet outside, until they could see one\r\nanother at her home, in the new, conquered lodging. Winter approached\r\nits term, and the month of February proved very mild. They prolonged\r\ntheir walks, sauntering for hours over the open ground adjoining the\r\nstation. S\xc3\xa9verine continued to make her trip to Paris every Friday; and\r\nnow she did not offer her husband the slightest explanation. For the\r\nneighbours, the old pretext, a bad knee sufficed; and she also said\r\nthat she went to see her wet-nurse, Mother Victoire, who was a long\r\ntime getting through her convalescence at the hospital. Both S\xc3\xa9verine\r\nand Jacques still took great pleasure in these journeys. He showed\r\nhimself particularly attentive to his locomotive; she, delighted to\r\nsee him less gloomy, found amusement in looking out of the window,\r\nnotwithstanding that she began to know every little hill and clump of\r\ntrees on the way.\r\n\r\nFrom Havre to Motteville were meadows, flat fields separated by green\r\nhedges and planted with apple-trees; then as far as Rouen came a\r\nstretch of irregular, desert land. After Rouen, the Seine streamed\r\nby. They crossed it at Sotteville, at Oissel, at Pont-de-l\'Arche.\r\nNow it constantly reappeared, expanding to great breadth across the\r\nvast plains. From Gaillon it was hardly once lost to view. It ran on\r\nthe left, slackening in speed between its low banks, bordered with\r\npoplars and willows. The train, darting along a hillside, abandoned the\r\nriver at Bonni\xc3\xa8res to abruptly meet it once more on issuing from the\r\nRolleboise tunnel at Rosny. It seemed like a friendly companion on the\r\njourney, and was crossed three times again before reaching Paris.\r\n\r\nAs the train sped gaily on its way, Mantes appeared with its belfry\r\namidst the trees, Triel with its white limekilns, Poissy, which the\r\nline severed in twain, in the very heart of the town. Next came the two\r\ngreen screens of Saint Germain forest, the slope of Colombes, bursting\r\nwith lilac, and they were in the outskirts of Paris. The city could be\r\nperceived from the bridge at Asni\xc3\xa8res; the distant Arc de Triomphe,\r\ntowering above sordid buildings, bristling with factory chimneys. The\r\nengine plunged beneath Batignolles, and the passengers streamed from\r\nthe carriages on to the platform of the echoing station.\r\n\r\nUntil night S\xc3\xa9verine and Jacques were free, and belonged to one\r\nanother. On the return journey, it being dark, she closed her eyes,\r\nenjoying her happiness over again. But morning and night, each time\r\nshe passed La Croix-de-Maufras, she advanced her head; and, without\r\ndiscovering herself, cast a furtive glance outside the carriage,\r\ncertain that she would there find Flore, erect before the gate of the\r\nlevel-crossing, presenting the flag in its case, and embracing the\r\ntrain with her flaming eyes.\r\n\r\nSince the snowy day when this girl had caught them kissing one another,\r\nJacques had warned S\xc3\xa9verine to be careful of her. He was no longer\r\nignorant of that passion of a wild creature wherewith she had pursued\r\nhim from her earliest years. He felt that she was jealous, and that\r\nshe possessed virile energy, as well as unbridled and deadly rancour.\r\nMoreover, she must be well-informed in regard to matters concerning\r\nS\xc3\xa9verine, for he remembered her allusion to the intimacy of the\r\nPresident with a certain young lady whom no one suspected, and for\r\nwhom he had found a husband. If she knew this, she must assuredly have\r\npenetrated the mystery of the crime. Doubtless, she would be talking or\r\nwriting, so as to avenge herself by a denunciation.\r\n\r\nBut days and weeks passed without anything happening. He still found\r\nher there, planted rigidly at her post beside the line, with her flag.\r\nFar away, as soon as she was able to catch sight of the locomotive, he\r\nfelt the sensation of her burning eyes. She saw him, notwithstanding\r\nthe smoke, and embraced all his frame in her glance, following him in\r\nthe lightning flash amidst the thunder of the wheels.\r\n\r\nAnd the train was scrutinised at the same time, pierced through and\r\nthrough, inspected from the first carriage to the last; she always\r\ndiscovered the other one, the rival, whom she now knew to be there\r\nevery Friday. And S\xc3\xa9verine might well advance her head but a trifle,\r\nimpelled by the imperious necessity to look. She was seen. Their eyes\r\ncrossed like rapiers. The train was already far away, devouring space;\r\nand one person remained on the ground, powerless to follow it, raging\r\nat the happiness it bore along. Flore seemed to be growing. Jacques\r\nfound her taller at each journey, and felt uneasy at her taking no\r\naction, wondering what plan would ripen in the head of this great,\r\ngloomy girl, whose motionless apparition he could not avoid.\r\n\r\nThere was also one of the servants of the company, that headguard,\r\nHenri Dauvergne, who inconvenienced S\xc3\xa9verine and Jacques. He happened\r\nto be in charge of this Friday train, and he displayed importunate\r\namiability towards the young woman. The attentions of Henri became\r\nso apparent, that Roubaud observed them with sneering countenance on\r\nthe mornings when he was on duty at the departure from Havre. The\r\nheadguard was in the habit of reserving an entire compartment for\r\nhis wife, and took pains to see she was comfortable there, feeling\r\nthe foot-warmer to make sure the water was hot, and so forth. On one\r\noccasion the husband, while continuing a chat with Jacques, attracted\r\nhis notice to the proceedings of the young man with a wink, as if to\r\ninquire whether he permitted that kind of thing.\r\n\r\nIn the family quarrels, Roubaud flatly accused his wife of making love\r\nto the pair. And S\xc3\xa9verine imagined, for an instant, that Jacques also\r\nhad this belief, which was the cause of his sadness. In a burst of\r\ntears, she protested her innocence, telling him to kill her if she were\r\nunfaithful. But he merely laughed, and, turning very pale, embraced\r\nher, saying he was convinced of her fidelity, and that he sincerely\r\nhoped he would never kill anybody.\r\n\r\nThe first evenings of March were frightful, and they were obliged to\r\ninterrupt their meetings. The trips to Paris, the few hours of freedom\r\nsought so far away, were no longer enough for S\xc3\xa9verine. She experienced\r\nan increasing desire to have Jacques with her, always with her, to live\r\ntogether, without ever leaving one another. And her execration for her\r\nhusband increased. The mere presence of this man threw her into an\r\nunhealthy and intolerable state of excitement. She so docile, with all\r\nthe complacence of a tender-hearted woman, became irritated as soon\r\nas it was a question of Roubaud, flying into a passion at the least\r\nopposition he made to her will.\r\n\r\nOn such occasions the shade of her raven hair seemed to darken the\r\nlimpid blue of her eyes. She became fierce, accusing him of having so\r\nthoroughly spoilt her existence that henceforth it would be impossible\r\nto live together. Had not he done it all? If they were no longer as\r\nman and wife, if she had a sweetheart, was it not his own fault?\r\nHis sluggish tranquillity, the look of indifference with which he\r\nmet her anger, his round shoulders, his enlarged stomach, all that\r\ndreadful fat, resembling happiness, completed her exasperation, she who\r\nsuffered. Her one thought, now, was to break with him, to get away, to\r\ngo and begin life again elsewhere. Oh! could she but commence again,\r\nwipe out the past, return to the life she led previous to all these\r\nabominations, find herself as she was at fifteen, and love, and be\r\nloved, and live as she dreamed of living then!\r\n\r\nFor a week, she courted the idea of taking flight: she would leave with\r\nJacques, they would conceal themselves in Belgium, where they would\r\nset up housekeeping as a hard-working young couple. But she had not\r\nspoken to him on the subject. Obstacles had at once come in the way:\r\ntheir irregular position, the constant anxiety in which they would find\r\nthemselves, and particularly the annoyance of leaving her fortune to\r\nher husband--the money, La Croix-de-Maufras.\r\n\r\nBy a donation to the survivor of the pair--which is possible in France,\r\nand cannot be revoked without the consent of both parties--they had\r\nwilled everything away; and she found herself in his power, in that\r\nlegal tutelage of a wife which tied her hands. Rather than leave, and\r\nabandon even a sou, she would have preferred to die there. One day\r\nwhen he came up, livid, to say that crossing the line in front of a\r\nlocomotive he had felt the buffer graze his elbow, she reflected that\r\nif he had been killed, she would have been free. She observed him with\r\nher great staring eyes; why on earth did he not die, since she had\r\nceased to love him, and he was now in the way of everyone?\r\n\r\nFrom that moment the dream of S\xc3\xa9verine changed: Roubaud had been\r\nkilled in an accident, and she left with Jacques for America. But they\r\nwere married. They had sold La Croix-de-Maufras, and realised all the\r\nfortune. Behind them they left nothing they were afraid of. If they\r\nemigrated, it was to be born again in the arms of one another. Over\r\nthere, naught would exist of the events she wished to forget, and\r\nshe could imagine she was beginning a new life. As she had made a\r\nmistake, she would engage in the experience of happiness again at the\r\ncommencement. He would find employment; she could undertake something\r\nelse. They would make their fortune. Perhaps children might come, and\r\nthere would be a new existence of labour and felicity.\r\n\r\nAs soon as she was alone in bed in the morning, and while engaged on\r\nher embroidery in the daytime, she resumed the construction of this\r\ncastle in the air, modifying, enlarging, ceaselessly adding delightful\r\ndetails to it, and ended by imagining herself overwhelmed with joy and\r\nriches. She, who formerly went out so rarely, had now a passion for\r\ngoing to see the mail-steamers put to sea: she ran down to the jetty,\r\nleant over the balustrade, followed the smoke of the vessel until it\r\nbecame lost in the haze of the offing; and she fancied herself on deck\r\nwith Jacques, already far from France, steaming for the paradise of her\r\ndreams.\r\n\r\nOne evening in the month of March, Jacques having taken the risk\r\nof going up to see her, related that he had brought one of his old\r\nschoolfellows in his train from Paris, who was leaving for New York,\r\nto bring out a new invention, a machine for making buttons; and, as he\r\nwanted an engineer as partner, he had offered to take the driver with\r\nhim. Oh! it was a magnificent enterprise, only requiring the investment\r\nof 30,000 frcs., a matter of \xc2\xa31,200, and in which there were perhaps\r\nmillions to be made. Jacques merely mentioned the subject casually,\r\nand concluded by saying that he had of course refused the offer.\r\nNevertheless, he felt a bit sorry, for it is hard to turn the back on\r\nfortune when it comes to one.\r\n\r\nS\xc3\xa9verine, on her feet, listened to him with vacant eyes. Was not this\r\nher dream which was going to be realised?\r\n\r\n"Ah!" murmured she at last, "we would start to-morrow----"\r\n\r\nHe raised his head in surprise, and interrupted her with the inquiry:\r\n\r\n"What do you mean by we would start?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, if he were dead," she replied.\r\n\r\nShe had not named Roubaud, but he understood, and gave a vague gesture\r\nto say that, unfortunately, he was not dead.\r\n\r\n"We would set out," she resumed in her slow, deep voice, "and we should\r\nbe so happy over there! I could get the 30,000 frcs. by selling the\r\nproperty, and I should still have enough to enable us to settle down.\r\nYou could turn the cash to account; I would arrange a little home,\r\nwhere we would love one another with all our might. Oh! it would be so\r\nnice, so nice!"\r\n\r\nAnd she added, very low:\r\n\r\n"Far from all recollection of the past, and only new times ahead of us!"\r\n\r\nHe felt deeply affected. Their two hands joined, and pressed one\r\nanother instinctively. Then came a pause, both S\xc3\xa9verine and Jacques\r\nbeing rapt in this hope. It was she who broke the silence.\r\n\r\n"All the same, it would be best for you to see your friend again before\r\nhis departure, and ask him not to take a partner without letting you\r\nknow," she suggested.\r\n\r\nOnce more he was surprised.\r\n\r\n"What is the use of that?" he inquired.\r\n\r\n"Good heavens! Who knows?" she answered. "The other day, with that\r\nlocomotive! Another second and I was free. One is alive in the morning,\r\nand dead at night. Is it not true?"\r\n\r\nLooking at him fixedly, she repeated:\r\n\r\n"Ah! if he were only dead!"\r\n\r\n"But you don\'t want me to kill him, do you?" he inquired, trying to\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\nThrice she answered no; but her eyes said yes--those eyes of a\r\ntender-hearted woman, who had abandoned herself to the inexorable\r\ncruelty of her passion. As he had killed another, why should not he\r\nbe killed himself? This idea had abruptly begun to assert itself as a\r\nconsequence of the crime, a necessary termination to the difficulty.\r\nKill him and go away: nothing could be more simple. When he was once\r\ndead, everything would be over, and she could begin again. She saw no\r\nother solution possible, and her resolution was irrevocably taken; but,\r\nnot having the courage of her violence, she continued, in slightly\r\nwavering tones, to say no.\r\n\r\nJacques, standing with his back to the sideboard, still affected to\r\nsmile. He had just caught sight of the knife lying there.\r\n\r\n"If you want me to kill him," said he, his smile broadening into a\r\nlaugh, "you must give me the knife. I already have the watch, and this\r\nwill help to make me a small museum."\r\n\r\n"Take the knife," she gravely answered.\r\n\r\nAnd when he had put it in his pocket, as if to carry on the joke to the\r\nend, he kissed her.\r\n\r\n"And now, good-night," he said. "I shall go and see my friend at once,\r\nand tell him to wait. If it does not rain next Saturday, come and meet\r\nme behind the cottage of Sauvagnat, eh? Is that understood? And rest\r\nassured that we will kill no one. It\'s only a joke."\r\n\r\nNevertheless, in spite of the late hour, Jacques went down towards\r\nthe port to find the comrade leaving on the morrow. He spoke to him\r\nof a legacy he might receive, and asked for a fortnight before giving\r\na definite answer. Then, on his way back towards the station by the\r\ngreat dark avenues, he thought the matter over, and felt astonished\r\nat what he had just done. Had he then resolved to kill Roubaud, since\r\nhe was disposing of his wife and money? No, indeed, he had come to no\r\ndecision, and if he took these precautions, it was no doubt in case he\r\nshould decide. But the recollection of S\xc3\xa9verine entered his mind, the\r\nburning pressure of her hand, her fixed eyes saying yes, while her lips\r\nsaid no. She evidently wanted him to kill her husband. He felt very\r\nmuch troubled. What should he do?\r\n\r\nWhen Jacques returned to the Rue Fran\xc3\xa7ois-Mazeline and lay down in his\r\nbed, beside that of Pecqueux, who was snoring, he could not sleep.\r\nDo what he would, his brain set to work on this idea of murder, this\r\nweb of a drama that he was arranging, and whose most far-reaching\r\nconsequences he calculated. He thought. He weighed the reasons for, and\r\nthe reasons against. Summing up calmly, without the least excitement,\r\nafter reflection, everything was in favour of the crime. Was not\r\nRoubaud the sole obstacle to his happiness? With Roubaud dead, he would\r\nmarry S\xc3\xa9verine, whom he adored. Besides, there was the money--a fortune.\r\n\r\nHe would give up his hard handicraft, and in his turn become an\r\nemployer of labour, in that America of which he heard his comrades\r\ntalk as of a country where engine-men shovelled in the gold. His\r\nnew existence, over there, would unfold like a dream: a wife who\r\npassionately loved him, millions to be earned at once, a grand style of\r\nliving, unlimited scope for ambition; in fact, anything he pleased. And\r\nto realise this dream he had only to make a movement, only to suppress\r\na man, the insect, the plant in your way on the path, and which you\r\ntrample on. He was not even interesting, this man who had now grown\r\nfat and heavy, who was plunged in that stupid passion for cards, which\r\nhad destroyed his former energy. Why spare him? There was nothing,\r\nabsolutely nothing to plead in his favour. Everything condemned him,\r\nbecause in response to each question, came the answer that it was to\r\nthe interest of others he should die. To hesitate would be idiotic and\r\ncowardly.\r\n\r\nJacques bounded in his bed, starting at a thought, at first vague,\r\nand then abruptly so piercing that he felt it like a prick in his\r\nskull. He, who from childhood desired to kill, who was ravaged to the\r\npoint of torture by the horror of that fixed idea, why did he not kill\r\nRoubaud? Perhaps, on this selected victim, he would for ever assuage\r\nhis thirst for murder; and, in that way, he would not only do a good\r\nstroke of business, but he would be cured as well. Cured, great God!\r\nHe became bathed in perspiration. He saw himself with the knife in\r\nhis hand, striking at the throat of Roubaud as the latter had struck\r\nthe President, and become satisfied and appeased in proportion as the\r\nwound bled upon his hands. He would kill him. He was resolved to do so,\r\nfor that would give him his cure, as well as the woman he adored, and\r\nfortune. As he had to kill somebody, since he must kill, he would kill\r\nthis man, with the knowledge at all events that what he did was done\r\nrationally, by interest and logic.\r\n\r\nThree o\'clock in the morning had just struck, when this decision was\r\narrived at, and Jacques endeavoured to sleep. He was already dozing off\r\nwhen a violent start brought him up in his bed in a sitting posture,\r\nchoking. Kill this man! Great God! had he the right? When a fly\r\npestered him he crushed it with a smack. One day when a cat got between\r\nhis legs he broke its spine by a kick, without wishing to do so, it\r\nis true. But this man, his fellow creature! He had to resume all his\r\nreasoning to prove to himself that he had a right to commit murder--the\r\nright of the strong who find the weak in their way and devour them.\r\nIt was he whom the wife of the other one loved at this hour, and she\r\nwanted to be free to marry him and bring him what she possessed.\r\n\r\nWhen two wolves met in the wood, and a she-wolf was there, did not the\r\nstronger rid himself of the other with his fangs? And in ancient times,\r\nwhen men found refuge in the caverns, like the wolves, did not the\r\ncoveted woman belong to that man in the band who could win her in the\r\nblood of his rivals? Then, as this was the law of life, it should be\r\nobeyed, apart from the scruples invented later on to regulate existence\r\nin common.\r\n\r\nLittle by little his right appeared to him absolute, and he felt his\r\nresolution affirmed. On the morrow he would select the spot and hour,\r\nand make preparations for the deed. Doubtless it would be best to stab\r\nRoubaud at night on the station premises, during one of his rounds, so\r\nas to convey the impression that he had fallen a victim to some thieves\r\nhe had surprised. He knew a good place, over there behind the coal\r\nheaps, if Roubaud could only be attracted to the spot. In spite of his\r\ndesire to sleep, he could not help arranging the scene then, debating\r\nin his mind where he would place himself, how he would strike, so as to\r\nstretch his victim at his feet; and insensibly, invincibly, as he went\r\ninto the smallest details, his repugnance returned, inner protestation\r\ngained the upper hand.\r\n\r\nNo, no, he would not deal the blow! It appeared to him monstrous, a\r\nthing that could not be done, impossible. The civilised man within\r\nhim, influenced by the power acquired through education, by the\r\nslowly erected and indestructible edifice of ideas handed down to\r\nhim, revolted. Kill not! He had taken in that law at the breast, with\r\nthe milk of generations. His refined brain, furnished with scruples,\r\nrepelled the thought of murder with horror, as soon as he began to\r\nreason about it. Yes, kill by necessity, instinctively, in a fit of\r\npassion; but kill deliberately, by calculation and interest, no, he\r\ncould never, never do it!\r\n\r\nDawn was breaking when Jacques succeeded in dozing off, but his sleep\r\nwas so light that the debate continued confusedly in his mind, causing\r\nhim abominable suffering. The ensuing days were the most painful of his\r\nexistence. He avoided S\xc3\xa9verine. Dreading her look, he sent her word not\r\nto come to the appointment on the Saturday. But the following Monday\r\nhe was obliged to meet her; and, as he had feared, her great blue\r\neyes, so soft and deep, filled him with anguish. She did not refer to\r\nthe subject, she did not make a sign, nor say a word to urge him on,\r\nonly her eyes were full of the thing, questioning, imploring him. He\r\nhardly knew which way to turn to avoid their impatient and reproachful\r\ngaze. He always found them fixed on his own eyes, in an expression of\r\nastonishment that he could hesitate to be happy.\r\n\r\nWhen he kissed her at parting, he abruptly strained her to him, to give\r\nher to understand that he had resolved to act. And so, indeed, he had,\r\nuntil he reached the bottom of the stairs and found himself struggling\r\nwith his conscience again. When he saw her, two days later, he was pale\r\nwith confusion, and had the furtive look of a coward who hesitates in\r\nface of a necessary action. She burst into sobs without saying a word,\r\nweeping with her arms round his neck, horribly unhappy; and he, quite\r\nunhinged, felt the utmost contempt for himself. He must put an end to\r\nit.\r\n\r\n"On Thursday, over there, will you?" she inquired in a low voice.\r\n\r\n"Yes, on Thursday I will wait for you," he answered.\r\n\r\nOn that particular Thursday the night was very dark, a starless sky,\r\nopaque and heavy, loaded with mist from the sea. Jacques, as usual,\r\narrived the first, and, standing behind the cottage of the Sauvagnats,\r\nwatched for S\xc3\xa9verine. But the gloom was so intense, and she hurried\r\nalong so lightly, that she brushed against him before he caught sight\r\nof her, making him start. She was already in his arms, and alarmed at\r\nfeeling him tremble, she murmured:\r\n\r\n"Did I frighten you?"\r\n\r\n"No, no," he replied, "I was expecting you. Let us walk on; no one can\r\nsee us."\r\n\r\nAnd with their arms round the waists of one another, they strolled\r\nslowly over the vacant ground. There were but few gas-lamps on this\r\nside of the dep\xc3\xb4t. In some gloomy quarters there were none at all;\r\nwhereas they swarmed in the distance, near the station, like a quantity\r\nof bright sparks.\r\n\r\nJacques and S\xc3\xa9verine walked about for a long time without a word. She\r\nhad rested her head on his shoulder, and raised it ever and anon to\r\nkiss him on the chin; while he, bending down, returned the kiss on\r\nher forehead at the roots of her hair. The grave, solitary stroke of\r\none o\'clock in the morning, had just resounded from air the distant\r\nchurches. If they failed to speak, it was because they felt they were\r\nboth thinking. They were thinking of nothing but that one subject. It\r\nwas impossible for them to be together now without finding themselves\r\nbeset by it. The mental debate continued. What was the use of saying\r\nuseless words aloud, as it was necessary to act? When she raised\r\nherself against him for a caress, she felt the knife, which formed a\r\nlump in his pocket. Could it be possible that he had made up his mind?\r\n\r\nBut her thoughts were too much for her, and her lips parted in a murmur\r\nthat was scarcely audible:\r\n\r\n"Just now he came upstairs; I was wondering what for. Then I saw him\r\ntake his revolver, which he had forgotten. He is certainly going to\r\nmake a round."\r\n\r\nThey resumed silence, and it was only twenty paces further on that he,\r\nin his turn, remarked:\r\n\r\n"Last night some thieves took away the lead from here. He will come\r\nalong presently for sure."\r\n\r\nShe gave a little shudder; both became silent, and they walked on more\r\nslowly. Then she had a doubt: was it really the knife that formed the\r\nlump in his pocket? Twice she stooped down knocking against it to get\r\na better idea. Then, being still uncertain, she let her hand drop, and\r\nfelt. It was the knife sure enough. And Jacques, understanding her\r\nthoughts, suddenly strained her to him stammering into her ear:\r\n\r\n"He will come, and you shall be free."\r\n\r\nThe murder was decided. They no longer seemed to be walking. It\r\nappeared to them that some strange force sent them along just above\r\nthe ground. Their senses had, all at once, become extremely acute,\r\nparticularly the touch, for their hands, resting one in the other, were\r\nin pain, and the slightest brush of the lips was like a scratch. They\r\nalso heard sounds which were lost a moment before--the rumble, the\r\ndistant puffs of the engines, the muffled shocks, footsteps wandering\r\nin the depth of the obscurity. And they could see into the night; they\r\ndistinguished the black spots of objects as if a mist had been removed\r\nfrom their eyes, they were able to follow the sharp curves described in\r\nthe air by a passing bat. They stopped, motionless, at the corner of a\r\nheap of coal, ears and eyes on the alert, and with all their beings in\r\na state of tension; they now spoke in whispers.\r\n\r\n"Did you hear that?" she inquired. "Over there, somebody calling."\r\n\r\n"No," he replied, "they\'re putting a carriage into the coach-house."\r\n\r\n"But there, someone is walking on our left," said she. "I heard the\r\nsound on the gravel."\r\n\r\n"No, no," he answered, "rats are running over the coal heaps, and some\r\nof the pieces rolled down."\r\n\r\nSeveral minutes passed. Suddenly it was she who strained him to her\r\nmore closely.\r\n\r\n"There he is!" she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n"Where? I can\'t see him," said he.\r\n\r\n"He has turned round the shed of the slow-train goods department,"\r\nshe continued. "He is coming straight towards us. Look at his shadow,\r\npassing along the white wall!"\r\n\r\n"Do you think it is? That dark spot? Then he must be alone," he said.\r\n\r\n"Yes, alone. He is alone," she repeated.\r\n\r\nAnd at this decisive moment she passionately threw herself on his neck,\r\nshe pressed her burning lips to his. It was a prolonged embrace, in\r\nwhich she would have wished to have conveyed her own blood to him. How\r\nshe loved him! and how she execrated the other! Ah! had she but dared,\r\ntwenty times over she would have done the business herself, to spare\r\nhim the horror; but her hands were unequal to the effort, she felt\r\nherself too feeble, it required the fist of a man. And this kiss, which\r\nwas without end, was all she could breathe to him of her own courage.\r\n\r\nA locomotive whistled in the distance, casting to the night a\r\nmelancholy lamentation of distress. At regular intervals they\r\ncould hear the loud strokes of a colossal hammer coming from an\r\nundeterminable direction. The vapour ascending from the sea sailed\r\nacross the sky in chaotic confusion, while drifting shreds seemed at\r\nmoments to extinguish the bright sparks of the gas-lamps. When S\xc3\xa9verine\r\nat length removed her mouth from his, it seemed as if she had ceased to\r\nexist, as if all her soul had passed into him.\r\n\r\nJacques abruptly opened the knife. But with a stifled oath, he\r\nexclaimed:\r\n\r\n"It\'s all up! He\'s off!"\r\n\r\nAnd so it was. The moving shadow, after approaching to within fifty\r\npaces of them, had just turned to the left, and was retreating with the\r\neven step of a night watchman who had no cause for alarm.\r\n\r\nThen she pushed him.\r\n\r\n"Go on, go on!" said she.\r\n\r\nAnd they both started. He ahead; she close at his heels. They glided\r\nbehind the man, hunting him down, careful not to make a noise. Then as\r\nthey took a short cut across a shunting-line, they found him twenty\r\npaces at the most away. They had to take advantage of every bit of wall\r\nfor shelter. One false step would have betrayed them.\r\n\r\n"We shall never reach him," said he, in a hollow voice. "If he attains\r\nthe box of the pointsman he will escape."\r\n\r\nShe continued, repeating behind him:\r\n\r\n"Go on, go on!"\r\n\r\nAt this minute, surrounded by the vast flat waste ground plunged in\r\nobscurity, amidst the nocturnal desolation of a great railway station,\r\nhe was resolved to act, as in that solitude which is the natural\r\nattendant on assassination. And while he stealthily hastened his steps,\r\nhe became excited, reasoning with himself, supplying himself with\r\narguments that were to make this murder a wise, legitimate action,\r\nlogically debated and decided on. It certainly was a right that he\r\nwould be exercising, the right even of life, as this blood of another\r\nwas indispensable to his own existence. He had merely to plunge this\r\nknife into the man to win happiness.\r\n\r\n"We shall not get him, we shall not get him," he repeated furiously,\r\nobserving the shadow pass beyond the box of the pointsman. "It\'s all\r\nup! There he is, going off."\r\n\r\nBut S\xc3\xa9verine abruptly caught him by the arm with her nervous hand, and\r\nbrought him to a standstill against her.\r\n\r\n"Look!" she exclaimed, "he\'s coming back!"\r\n\r\nRoubaud, indeed, was retracing his steps. He had gone to the right,\r\nthen he returned. Perhaps, behind him, he had felt the vague sensation\r\nof the murderers on his track. Nevertheless, he continued to walk at\r\nhis usual tranquil pace, like a conscientious watchman, who will not\r\nretire to his quarters without having taken a glance everywhere.\r\n\r\nJacques and S\xc3\xa9verine, pulled up short in their race, no longer moved.\r\nChance had placed them right at the angle of the heap of coal. They\r\npressed their backs so closely to it that they seemed to form part of\r\nthe black mass. There, without a breath, they watched Roubaud advancing\r\ntowards them. They were barely separated from him by thirty yards. Each\r\nstride lessened the distance, regularly, as if timed by the inexorable\r\npendulum of destiny. Another twenty, another ten paces, and Jacques\r\nwould have the man before him. He would raise his arm in such a manner\r\nand plunge the knife in the throat of Roubaud, drawing it from right\r\nto left so as to stifle his shriek. The seconds seemed interminable.\r\nSuch a flood of thoughts ran through the blank in his skull that the\r\nmeasure of time no longer existed. All the reasons that had brought\r\nhim to his determination filed past once more. He again distinctly saw\r\nthe murder, the causes and the consequences. Another five steps. His\r\nresolution, strained fit to break, remained firm. He wanted to kill; he\r\nknew why he would kill.\r\n\r\nBut at two paces, at one pace, came a downfall; everything gave way\r\nwithin him at a single stroke. No, no! he would not, he could not\r\nkill a defenceless man in this way. Reasoning would never suffice\r\nfor murder; it required the instinct to bite, the spring that sends\r\nthe destroyer on the prey, the hunger or passion that makes him tear\r\nit to pieces. What matter if conscience were merely made up of ideas\r\ntransmitted by a slow heredity of justice! He did not feel that he had\r\nthe right to kill, and do what he would, he was unable to persuade\r\nhimself that he could take it.\r\n\r\nRoubaud passed slowly by. His elbow almost grazed the other two in the\r\ncoal. A breath would have betrayed them; but they remained as dead. The\r\narm did not rise; it did not plunge in the knife. No quiver disturbed\r\nthe dense obscurity, not even a shudder. Roubaud was already far, ten\r\npaces off; but they were still standing there motionless, their backs\r\nriveted to the black heap. Both were without breath, in terror of this\r\nman, alone and unarmed, who had just brushed past them so peacefully.\r\n\r\nJacques, choking with rage and shame, gave a sob.\r\n\r\n"I cannot do it! I cannot do it!" he repeated.\r\n\r\nHe wanted to take S\xc3\xa9verine to him again, to press against her, with\r\nthe desire to be excused and consoled. She escaped without a word.\r\nHe had stretched out his hands, but only to catch her skirt, which\r\nslipped from his fingers; and he heard nothing, save her light,\r\nfleeting footsteps. Her sudden disappearance completely undid him, and\r\nhe pursued her for an instant or two; but in vain. Was she then so\r\nvery angry at his weakness? Did she despise him? Prudence prevented\r\nhim rejoining her. When he found himself alone on this extensive flat\r\nland, studded with small yellow flames of gas, he felt overwhelmed\r\nwith despair, and hastened to leave it, to go and bury his head in his\r\npillow, there to forget the abomination of his existence.\r\n\r\nIt was a matter of ten days later, towards the end of March, that the\r\nRoubauds at last triumphed over the Lebleus. The railway company had\r\nrecognised their appeal, supported by M. Dabadie, as just; and the more\r\neasily did they arrive at this conclusion as the famous letter from\r\nthe cashier, undertaking to give up the lodging if a new assistant\r\nstation-master claimed it, had been found by Mademoiselle Guichon,\r\nwhile looking over some old accounts in the archives of the station.\r\nAnd Madame Lebleu, exasperated at her defeat, at once spoke of moving;\r\nas they wanted to kill her, she might just as well die now without\r\nwaiting.\r\n\r\nFor three days this memorable removal kept the corridor in a fever.\r\nLittle Madame Moulin, herself usually so retiring, whom no one ever\r\nsaw come in or go out, became implicated in the business by carrying\r\na work-table from one lodging to the other. But it was particularly\r\nPhilom\xc3\xa8ne who breathed the breath of discord. She had arrived there,\r\nto assist, from the very commencement, doing up packages, jostling the\r\nfurniture, invading the lodging on the front before the tenant had\r\nleft; and it was she who pushed her out, amidst the going and coming of\r\nthe two sets of household goods, which had got mixed together, in wild\r\nconfusion, in the course of transport. When Philom\xc3\xa8ne had carried off\r\nthe last chair the doors banged; but perceiving a stool, which the wife\r\nof the cashier had forgotten, she opened again, and threw it across the\r\ncorridor. That was the end.\r\n\r\nPhilom\xc3\xa8ne had reached the point of displaying such excessive zeal\r\nfor Jacques and all he loved, that Pecqueux was astonished. Feeling\r\nsuspicious, he asked her, in his nasty, sly manner, with his air of\r\na vindictive drunkard, whether she was now smitten with his driver,\r\nwarning her that he would settle the account of both of them if he ever\r\ncaught them together. Her fancy for the young man had increased, and\r\nshe acted as a sort of servant to him and his sweetheart, in the hope\r\nof gaining a little of his affection by placing herself between them.\r\n\r\nLife slowly resumed its monotonous course. While Madame Lebleu, at\r\nthe back, riveted to her armchair by rheumatism, was dying of spleen,\r\nwith great tears in her eyes because she could see nothing but the\r\nzinc roof of the marquee shutting out the sky, S\xc3\xa9verine worked at her\r\ninterminable bed-covering beside one of the windows on the front.\r\nBelow, she had the lively activity of the courtyard, the constant\r\nstream of pedestrians and carriages. The forward spring was already\r\nturning the buds of the great trees that lined the pavements green, and\r\nbeyond, the distant hills of Ingouville displayed their wooded slopes,\r\nstudded with the white spots of country houses.\r\n\r\nBut she felt astonished to find so little pleasure in the realisation\r\nof this dream at last, to be there, in this coveted apartment, with\r\nspace, daylight, and sun before her. When her charwoman, Mother Simon,\r\ngrumbled, furious at finding herself disturbed in her habits, she lost\r\npatience, and at times regretted her old hole, as she termed it, where\r\nthe dirt could not be so easily seen.\r\n\r\nRoubaud had simply let matters take their course. He did not seem to be\r\naware that he had changed his abode. He frequently made mistakes, and\r\nonly perceived his error on finding that his new key would not enter\r\nthe old lock. He absented himself more and more. The irregularity of\r\nhis life continued. Nevertheless, at one moment he seemed to brighten\r\nup under the influence of a revival of his political ideas. Not that\r\nthey were very clear or very ardent, but he had at heart that trouble\r\nwith the sub-prefect, which had almost cost him his position.\r\n\r\nNow that the Empire, which had met with a severe shock at the general\r\nelections, was passing through a terrible crisis, he triumphed, and\r\nhe repeated that those people would not always be the masters. But\r\na friendly warning from M. Dabadie, who heard about the matter from\r\nMademoiselle Guichon, in whose presence the revolutionary remark\r\nhad been made, sufficed to calm him. As the corridor was quiet, and\r\neveryone lived at peace, now that Madame Lebleu was drooping with\r\nsadness, why cause fresh annoyance on the subject of the government?\r\nRoubaud simply shrugged his shoulders. He cared not a fig about\r\npolitics, nor anything else! Growing fatter and fatter, day by day,\r\nand free from remorse, he moved along with heavy tread and an air of\r\nindifference.\r\n\r\nThe feeling of constraint had increased between S\xc3\xa9verine and Jacques,\r\nsince they were able to meet at any time. Nothing now interfered with\r\ntheir happiness. He ran up to see her by the other staircase whenever\r\nhe pleased, without fear of being spied upon. But the recollection\r\nof the thing that had not been realised, of the deed that both had\r\nconsented to, and wished to see done, and which he failed to perform,\r\nhad created an uneasiness, an insurmountable barrier between them. He,\r\ncoming with the shame of his weakness, found her on each occasion more\r\ndepressed, sick at waiting uselessly. Their lips no longer even sought\r\none another, for they had exhausted this semi-felicity; what they\r\ndesired was complete happiness--the departure, the marriage over there,\r\nthe other life.\r\n\r\nOne night Jacques found S\xc3\xa9verine in tears, and when she perceived\r\nhim, she did not stop, but sobbed louder, hanging round his neck. She\r\nhad already wept like this, but he had appeased her with an embrace;\r\nwhereas now, with her to his heart, he felt her ravaged with increasing\r\ndespair the more he pressed her to him. He was quite unhinged. At last,\r\ntaking her head between his two hands, and looking at her quite close,\r\ninto her streaming eyes, he made a vow, thoroughly understanding that\r\nif she despaired to this extent, it was because she felt herself a\r\nwoman, and in her passive gentleness, dared not strike with her own\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n"Forgive me!" said he; "wait a little longer. I swear to you that I\r\nwill do it shortly, as soon as I can."\r\n\r\nShe immediately pressed her lips to his, as if to seal this oath, and\r\nthey enjoyed one of those deep kisses in which they mingled one with\r\nthe other, in the communion of their flesh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n\r\nAunt Phasie died, in a final convulsion, at nine o\'clock on Thursday\r\nevening; and Misard, standing at the bedside, tried in vain to close\r\nher lids. The eyes obstinately remained open. The head had become\r\nrigid, and was slightly inclined over the shoulder, as if looking about\r\nthe room, while a contraction of the lips seemed to have curled them\r\nupward in a jeering smile. A single candle, stuck on the corner of a\r\ntable near her, lighted the surroundings; and the trains passing by,\r\nfull speed, in ignorance of the corpse being there, made it quiver for\r\na second or two in the vacillating light.\r\n\r\nMisard, to get rid of Flore, at once sent her off to Doinville to\r\napprise the authorities of the decease. She could not be back until\r\neleven o\'clock, so that he had two hours before him. He first of all\r\nquietly cut himself a slice of bread, for he felt hungry, having\r\ngone without his dinner on account of the death agony, which seemed\r\ninterminable. And he ate standing up, going and coming, arranging one\r\nthing and another about the room. Fits of coughing brought him to a\r\nstandstill, bent him double. He was half dead himself. So thin, so\r\npuny, with his leaden eyes and discoloured hair, that he did not seem\r\nlikely to enjoy his victory for long.\r\n\r\nNo matter, he had devoured this buxom wife, this tall, handsome woman,\r\nas the insect eats down the oak. She was on her back, polished off,\r\nreduced to nothing, and he still lasted. But why had she been so\r\nobstinate? She had tried to be cunning; so much the worse for her. When\r\na married couple play the game of seeing which shall bury the other,\r\nwithout putting anyone in the secret, it is necessary to keep a sharp\r\nlook out. He was proud of his achievement, and chuckled to himself as\r\nif it were a good joke.\r\n\r\nAt that instant an express train swept by, enveloping the low\r\nhabitation in such a gust of tempest, that in spite of his habit, he\r\nturned towards the window with a start. Ah! yes, that constant flood,\r\nthat mass of people coming from every quarter, who knew nothing about\r\nwhat they crushed on the road, and did not care, in such a hurry were\r\nthey to go to the devil! And turning round again, in the oppressive\r\nsilence, he met the two wide open eyes of the corpse, whose steady\r\npupils seemed to follow each of his movements, while the corners of the\r\nmouth curled upward in a smile.\r\n\r\nMisard, usually so phlegmatic, made a slight movement of anger. He\r\nthoroughly understood; she was saying to him: "Search! search!" But\r\nsurely she could not have taken her 1,000 frcs. away with her; and now\r\nthat she no longer existed, he would end by finding them. Ought she\r\nnot to have given them up willingly? It would have prevented all this\r\nannoyance. The eyes followed him everywhere. Search! search!\r\n\r\nHe now ferreted all over this room, which he had not dared rout out\r\nso long as she lived. First of all, in the cupboard. He took the keys\r\nfrom under the bolster, upset the shelves loaded with linen, emptied\r\nthe two drawers, pulled them out even, to ascertain if they concealed a\r\nhiding-place. No, nothing! After that, he thought of the night-table.\r\nHe unglued the marble top and turned it over, but to no purpose. With a\r\nflat rule he probed behind the chimney glass, one of those thin glasses\r\nsold in the fairs, that was fastened to the wall by a couple of nails;\r\nbut only to draw out a cobweb black with dust. Search! search!\r\n\r\nThen to escape those wide-open eyes which he felt resting on him,\r\nhe sank down on all fours, tapping lightly on the tiles with his\r\nknuckles, listening whether some resonance would not reveal a hole.\r\nSeveral tiles being loose, he tore them up. There was nothing, still\r\nnothing! When he rose to his feet again, the eyes once more caught him.\r\nHe wheeled round, wishing to stare straight into the fixed orbs of the\r\ndead woman, who, from the corners of her curled-up lips, seemed to\r\naccentuate her terrible laugh. There could be no doubt about it, she\r\nwas mocking him. Search! search!\r\n\r\nHe began to feel feverish. A suspicion came upon him, a sacrilegious\r\nidea, that made his livid countenance grow paler still, and he\r\napproached the corpse. What had made him think that she could surely\r\nnot have taken her 1,000 frcs. away with her? Perhaps, after all, she\r\nwas carrying them off. And he had the courage to uncover, to undress,\r\nand search the body, as she told him to search. He looked beneath her,\r\nbehind the nape of her neck, everywhere. The bedding was all upset. He\r\nburied his arm in the paillasse up to the shoulder, and found nothing.\r\nSearch! search! And the head of the dead woman fell back on the pillow,\r\nwhich was all in disorder, with the pupils of her bantering eyes still\r\nobserving him.\r\n\r\nAs Misard, furious and trembling, tried to arrange the bed, Flore came\r\nin, on her return from Doinville.\r\n\r\n"It will be for the day after to-morrow, at eleven o\'clock," said she.\r\n\r\nShe spoke of the burial. She understood at a glance what kind of work\r\nhad made Misard lose his breath during her absence, and she made a\r\ngesture of disdainful indifference.\r\n\r\n"You may just as well give it up," said she. "You\'ll never find them."\r\n\r\nImagining she also was braving him, he advanced towards her with set\r\nteeth.\r\n\r\n"She gave them you, or you know where they are?" said he inquiringly.\r\n\r\nThe idea that her mother could have given her 1,000 frcs. to anyone,\r\neven to her daughter, made her shrug her shoulders.\r\n\r\n"Ah! to blazes! gave them," she replied; "yes, gave them to the earth!\r\nLook, they are there! You can search."\r\n\r\nAnd, with a broad gesture, she indicated the entire house, the garden\r\nwith its well, the metal way, all the vast country. Yes, somewhere\r\nabout there, at the bottom of a hole, in a place where none would\r\never find them. Then, while Misard, beside himself with anxiety,\r\nbegan twisting and turning the furniture about again, sounding the\r\nwalls, without showing any constraint at her presence, the young girl,\r\nstanding before the window, continued in a subdued voice:\r\n\r\n"Oh! it is so mild outside. Such a lovely night! I walked quick. The\r\nstars make it like broad daylight. To-morrow, how beautiful it will be\r\nat sunrise!"\r\n\r\nFlore remained for an instant at the window, with her eyes on the\r\nserene country, stirred by this first gentle warmth of April, from\r\nwhich she had just returned thoughtful, and suffering more acutely from\r\nher vivified torment. But when she heard Misard leave the apartment,\r\nand continue his tenacious search in the adjoining rooms, she, in her\r\nturn, approached the bed, seating herself with her eyes on her mother.\r\nThe candle continued burning at the corner of the table, with a long,\r\nmotionless flame. A passing train jolted the house.\r\n\r\nFlore had resolved to remain there all night, and she sat pondering.\r\nFirst of all, the sight of the dead woman drew her from her fixed\r\nidea, from the thing that haunted her, which she had been debating in\r\nher mind beneath the stars, in the peaceful obscurity, all the way\r\nfrom Doinville. Surprise now set her suffering at rest. Why had she\r\nnot displayed more grief at the death of her mother? And why, at this\r\nmoment even, did she not shed tears?\r\n\r\nIndeed, she loved her well, notwithstanding her shyness of a great,\r\nsilent girl, who was for ever breaking away beating about the fields,\r\nas soon as released from duty. Twenty times over during the last crisis\r\nwhich was to kill her mother, she had come and sat there to implore\r\nher to call in a doctor; for she guessed what Misard was after, and\r\nwas in hopes that fear would stop him. But she had never been able to\r\nobtain anything more from the invalid than a furious No. It seemed as\r\nif her mother took pride in accepting no assistance in the struggle,\r\ncertain of the victory in spite of everything, as she carried off the\r\ncash; and then Flore ceased to interfere. Beset by her own chagrin, she\r\ndisappeared, careering hither and thither to forget.\r\n\r\nAssuredly this was what barred her heart. When a person has too keen\r\na trouble, there is no room for another. Her mother had gone; she saw\r\nher there, destroyed, and so pallid, without being able to feel any\r\nmore sad, notwithstanding her efforts. Call in the gendarmes! Denounce\r\nMisard! What would be the use of it, as there was about to be a general\r\nupheaval? And, little by little, invincibly, although her eyes remained\r\nfixed on the dead body, she ceased to perceive it. She returned to her\r\nown inner vision, occupied entirely by the idea that had planted itself\r\nin her brain, alive to nothing but the heavy shock of the trains, whose\r\npassage told her the time.\r\n\r\nThe approaching thunder of a slow train from Paris could be heard for\r\nan instant or two in the distance. When the locomotive at last flew by\r\nbefore the window, with its light, there came a flash, a perfect blaze\r\nin the room.\r\n\r\n"Eighteen minutes past one," thought Flore. "Seven hours more. This\r\nmorning at 8.16 they will come past."\r\n\r\nEvery week for months she had been worried by this expectation. She\r\nknew that on Friday morning the express driven by Jacques also took\r\nS\xc3\xa9verine to Paris, and tortured by jealousy, she only lived, as it\r\nwere, to watch them. Oh! that train flying along, and the abominable\r\nsensation she felt at being unable to cling on to the last carriage,\r\nso as to be also borne away! She fancied that all these wheels were\r\ncutting up her heart. She suffered so keenly that one night, having\r\nhidden herself, she prepared to write to the judicial authorities; for\r\nit would be all over if she could get this woman arrested. But, with\r\nthe pen in her hand, she could never set the matter down. And, besides,\r\nwould the authorities listen to her? All those fine people must be\r\nworking together. Perhaps they would even put her in prison, as they\r\nhad done with Cabuche.\r\n\r\nNo; she wanted to avenge herself, and she would do so alone, without\r\nthe assistance of anyone. It was not even a thought of vengeance, as\r\nshe understood the word, the idea of doing injury to cure herself. She\r\nfelt the need of finishing with the matter, of upsetting everything, as\r\nif thunder and lightning had swept the couple away. Being very proud,\r\nmore solidly built, and handsomer than the other, she felt convinced\r\nof her firm right to be loved; and when she went off alone along the\r\npaths of this abandoned district, with her heavy helmet of light hair,\r\never bare, she would have liked to come face to face with that other\r\none, so as to settle their quarrel at the corner of a wood, after the\r\nmanner of two hostile warrior women. Never yet had a man touched her;\r\nshe thrashed the males, and that constituted her invincible strength.\r\nTherefore, she would be victorious.\r\n\r\nThe week before, this idea had suddenly been planted, driven into\r\nher head as by the blow of a hammer, come from she knew not where:\r\nkill them, so that they might no longer pass by, no longer go there\r\ntogether. She did not reason, she obeyed the savage instinct of\r\ndestruction. When a thorn entered her flesh, she plucked it out. She\r\nwould have cut off her finger. Kill them, kill them the first time\r\nthey passed; and to do that, upset the train, drag a sleeper across\r\nthe line, tear up a rail, smash everything. He, on his engine, would\r\ncertainly remain there, stretched out; the woman, always in the\r\nfirst carriage, so as to be nearer to him, could not escape; as for\r\nthe others, that constant stream of passengers, she had not even a\r\nthought. They did not count, she did not know them! And at every hour\r\nshe was beset by this idea of destroying the train, of making this\r\nhuge sacrifice of lives. What she desired was an unique catastrophe,\r\nsufficiently great, sufficiently deep in human gore and suffering, for\r\nher to bathe therein her enormous heart swollen with tears.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, on the Friday morning, she had given way, not having yet\r\ndecided at what spot nor in what manner she would remove a rail. But\r\nthe same night, being off duty, she had an idea, and went prowling\r\nthrough the tunnel as far as the Dieppe embranchment. This was one of\r\nher walks, this trip through the subterranean passage, a good half\r\nleague in length, along this vaulted avenue, quite straight, where she\r\nfelt the emotion of trains with their blinding lights rolling over her.\r\nEach time, she had a narrow escape of being cut to pieces, and it must\r\nhave been the peril that attracted her there in a spirit of bravado.\r\n\r\nBut on this particular night, having escaped the vigilance of the\r\nwatchman and advanced to the middle of the tunnel, keeping to the left,\r\nso as to make sure that any train coming towards her would pass on her\r\nright, she had the imprudence to face about, just to follow the lights\r\nof a train on the way to Havre; and when she resumed walking, a false\r\nstep having made her swing round again, she lost all knowledge of the\r\ndirection in which the red lights had just disappeared.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding her courage, she stopped, still dizzy with the clatter\r\nof the wheels, her hands cold, her bare hair starting up in a breath\r\nof terror. She now imagined that when another train came along, she\r\nwould not know whether it was an up or a down train. With an effort she\r\nendeavoured to retain her reason, to remember, to think the matter\r\nover. Then, all at once, terror sent her along, haphazard, straight\r\nbefore her, at a frantic pace. No, no! she would not be killed before\r\nshe had killed the other two!\r\n\r\nHer feet were caught in the rails, she slipped, fell, rose up, and ran\r\nfaster than before. She became affected with tunnel madness. The walls\r\nseemed drawing close to one another to squeeze her, the vaulted roof\r\nechoed imaginary sounds, menacing utterances, formidable roars. At\r\nevery moment she turned her head, fancying she felt the burning steam\r\nof an engine on her neck. Twice the sudden conviction that she had made\r\na mistake, that she would be killed from the end she was fleeing to,\r\nmade her at a bound change the direction of her flight.\r\n\r\nAnd she was tearing onward, onward, when in front of her, in the\r\ndistance, appeared a star, a round flaming eye, increasing in size. But\r\nshe resisted the intense temptation to again retrace her steps. The eye\r\nbecame a lighted brazier, the mouth of a devouring furnace. Blinded,\r\nshe sprang to the left, at hazard; and the train passed, like a clap of\r\nthunder, doing nothing more than beat her cheek with its tempestuous\r\nblast of wind. Five minutes later, she issued from the Malaunay end of\r\nthe tunnel safe and sound.\r\n\r\nIt was then nine o\'clock, a few minutes more and the Paris express\r\nwould be there. She immediately continued her excursion at a walking\r\npace, to the Dieppe embranchment, a matter of two hundred yards or so\r\nfurther on, examining the metals in search of something that might\r\nserve her purpose. It so happened that her friend Ozil had just\r\nswitched a ballast train on to the Dieppe line, which was undergoing\r\nrepair, and it was standing there. In a sudden flash of enlightenment\r\nshe conceived a plan: simply prevent the pointsman from putting the\r\nswitch-tongue back on the Havre line, so that the express would dash\r\ninto the ballast train.\r\n\r\nShe felt a friendship for this Ozil since the day she had nearly\r\nbroken his head with a blow from a stick, and she was fond of paying\r\nhim unexpected visits like this, running through the tunnel after the\r\nfashion of a goat escaped from its mountain. An old soldier, very\r\nthin and little talkative, a slave to duty, his eyes ever on the\r\nlook-out, day and night, he had not yet been guilty of a single act of\r\nnegligence. Only this wild creature, who had beaten him, sturdy as a\r\nyoung man, could make him do what she pleased merely by beckoning to\r\nhim with her little finger.\r\n\r\nAnd so, on this particular night, when she approached his box in the\r\ndark, calling him outside, he went to her, forgetting everything.\r\nShe made his head swim as she led him out into the country, relating\r\ncomplicated tales about her mother being ill, and that she would not\r\nremain at La Croix-de-Maufras if she lost her. Her ear caught the\r\nroar of the express in the distance, leaving Malaunay, approaching at\r\nfull speed. And when she felt it hard by, she turned round to look.\r\nBut she had been reckoning without the new connecting apparatus: the\r\nlocomotive, in passing on to the Dieppe line, had itself just caused\r\nthe danger signal to be displayed; and the driver was able to stop at a\r\nfew paces from the ballast train.\r\n\r\nOzil, with the shout of a man awakened in a house tumbling down,\r\nregained his box at a run; while Flore, stiff and motionless, watched\r\nthe man\xc5\x93uvre necessitated by the accident in the darkness of night. Two\r\ndays later, the pointsman, who had been removed, having no suspicion of\r\nher duplicity, called to bid her farewell, imploring her to join him as\r\nsoon as she lost her mother. So her plot came to nothing, and she would\r\nhave to think of something else.\r\n\r\nAt this moment, under the influence of the recollection she had evoked,\r\nthe mist of reverie clouding her eyes disappeared, and again she\r\nperceived the corpse in the light of the yellow flame of the candle.\r\nHer mother was no more. Should she leave, and wed Ozil, who wanted\r\nher, and would perhaps make her happy? All her being revolted at the\r\nidea. No, no. If she had the cowardice to allow the other two to live\r\nand to live herself, she would prefer to tramp the roads, to take a\r\nsituation as servant, rather than belong to a man she did not love. And\r\na sound, to which she was unaccustomed, having caused her to listen,\r\nshe understood that Misard with a mattock was engaged in excavating the\r\nbeaten earth floor of the kitchen. He was going mad in his search for\r\nthe hoard; he would have gutted the house. No, she would not remain\r\nwith this one either. What was she going to do? There came a blast of\r\nwind, the walls vibrated, and on the pallid countenance of the corpse\r\npassed the reflex of a furnace, conveying a blood-like hue to the open\r\neyes, and to the ironic rictus of the lips. It was the last slow train\r\nfrom Paris, with its ponderous, sluggish engine.\r\n\r\nFlore had turned her head, and looked at the stars shining in the\r\nserenity of this spring night.\r\n\r\n"Ten minutes past three," she murmured. "Another five hours, and they\r\nwill pass."\r\n\r\nShe would begin over again; her suffering was too great. To see them\r\nlike this each week was more than her strength could bear. Now that\r\nshe was sure of not having Jacques to herself alone, she preferred\r\nthat he should no longer exist, that there should be nothing. And the\r\naspect of this lugubrious room, where she sat watching, imbued her with\r\nmournful suffering, and made her feel an increasing need to annihilate\r\neverything. As there remained no one who loved her, the others could go\r\nwith her mother. As for corpses, there would be more and more still,\r\nand they could carry them all away at the same time. Her sister was\r\ndead, her mother was dead, her love was dead. What could she do? Remain\r\nalone? Whether she stayed or left, she would always be alone, while the\r\nothers would be two together. No, no! let everything go to smash rather\r\nthan that. Let death, who was there in this room, blow on the line and\r\nsweep the people away.\r\n\r\nThen, with her mind made up after this long debate with herself,\r\nshe proceeded to think out the best way of putting her design into\r\nexecution. And she returned to the idea of removing a rail. This would\r\nbe the surest and most practical plan, and could be easily carried out;\r\nshe had only to drive away the chairs with a hammer, and then raise the\r\nrail from the sleepers. She had the tools. Nobody would see her in this\r\ndeserted district. A good spot to select would certainly be beyond the\r\ncutting, on the way to Barentin, at the curve which crossed a dale on\r\nan embankment thirty or thirty-five feet high. There the train would\r\nfor sure run off the line, and the fall would be terrible.\r\n\r\nBut the calculation of time, which then occupied her, made her anxious.\r\nOn the up-line, before the Havre express came by at 8.16, there was\r\nonly a slow train at 7.55. This would therefore give her twenty minutes\r\nto do the work, which was sufficient. Only, between the regular trains,\r\nthey often dispatched others that were unforeseen, loaded with goods,\r\nparticularly at moments when quantities of cargo arrived. Then what\r\na useless risk she would be incurring! How could she tell beforehand\r\nwhether it would be the express that would come to smash there? For a\r\nlong time she turned the probabilities over in her head. It was still\r\nnight. The candle continued to burn, bathed in tallow, with a long,\r\nsmutty wick which she had ceased to snuff.\r\n\r\nJust as a goods train arrived from Rouen, Misard returned. His hands\r\nwere covered with dirt, for he had been rummaging in the woodhouse,\r\nand he was out of breath, distracted at his vain efforts to lay hands\r\non the treasure. He had become so feverish with impotent rage, that he\r\nrenewed his search under the articles of furniture, up the chimney,\r\neverywhere. There was no end to the interminable train, with the\r\nregular fracas of its great wheels, which at each shock jolted the\r\ndead woman in her bed. Misard, stretching out his arm to take down\r\na small picture, hanging against the wall, again met the open eyes\r\nfollowing his motions, while the lips seemed to move with their laugh.\r\n\r\nHe became livid. He was shivering, and stuttered out in terrific anger:\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes; search! search! Never mind, I shall find it, even if I have\r\nto turn over every stone in the house, and every clod of ground in the\r\nneighbourhood!"\r\n\r\nThe black train had passed by in the obscurity, with painful slowness,\r\nand the dead woman, who had become motionless again, continued\r\nlooking at her husband so jeeringly, so certain of conquering, that\r\nhe disappeared a second time, leaving the door open. Flore, wandering\r\nin her reflections, had risen and closed the door, so that this man\r\nmight not return to disturb her mother; and she felt astonished to hear\r\nherself saying aloud:\r\n\r\n"Ten minutes beforehand will do."\r\n\r\nIn fact, she would have time in ten minutes. If no train was signalled\r\nten minutes before the express, she could set to work. The matter being\r\nnow settled, certain, her anxiety ceased, and she was very calm.\r\n\r\nDay broke at about five o\'clock, a fresh dawn, of pure limpidity. In\r\nspite of the slightly sharp cold, she set the window wide open, and the\r\ndelicious morning air entered the lugubrious room, full of smoke and\r\nan odour of the dead. The sun was still below the horizon, behind a\r\nhillock crowned by trees; but it appeared with a rosy tint, streaming\r\nover the slopes, pouring into the deep roads, amidst the lively gaiety\r\nof the earth at each new spring. She had not been mistaken on the\r\nprevious evening: it would be fine on that particular morning, one of\r\nthose days of youth and radiant health on which one delights in life.\r\nHow lovely it would be to set out along the goat paths at her own free\r\nwill, in this deserted country among the continuous hills cut up by\r\nnarrow dales! And when she turned round, facing the room, she was\r\nsurprised to see the candle looking almost as if gone out, and with\r\nnaught but a pale tear forming a spot in the broad daylight. The dead\r\nwoman seemed now to be gazing on the line where the trains continued\r\ncrossing one another, without even noticing this wan glimmer of a taper\r\nbeside the corpse.\r\n\r\nIt was not until daylight that Flore resumed duty, and she only quitted\r\nthe room for the slow train from Paris at 6.12. Misard, at six o\'clock,\r\nhad also relieved his colleague, the night signalman. It was at the\r\nsound of his horn that she had come and placed herself before the gate,\r\nthe flag in her hand. She followed the train an instant with her eyes.\r\n\r\n"Another two hours," thought she aloud.\r\n\r\nHer mother had no further need of anybody, and henceforth she\r\nexperienced invincible repugnance to return to the room. It was\r\nall over, she had kissed her, and now she could dispose of her own\r\nexistence and the lives of others. Usually, between the trains, she\r\nescaped and disappeared; but on this particular morning a feeling of\r\ninterest seemed to keep her at her post near the gate on a bench--a\r\nsimple plank that happened to be beside the line. The sun was ascending\r\non the horizon, a warm shower of gold fell into the pure air; and she\r\ndid not move, but sat there wrapped in this sweetness, in the midst of\r\nthe vast country all thrilling with the sap of April.\r\n\r\nFor a moment she watched Misard in his wooden hut, on the other side of\r\nthe line. He was visibly agitated, not having had his customary sleep.\r\nHe went out, went in, worked his apparatus with a nervous hand, casting\r\nconstant glances towards the house, as if his spirit had remained there\r\nand was still searching. Then she forgot him, was unaware even of him\r\nbeing there. She was all expectant, absorbed, her lips speechless, her\r\nface rigid, her eyes fixed on the end of the line in the direction of\r\nBarentin. And over there, in the gaiety of the sun, a vision must\r\nhave risen up for her, on which the stubborn savageness of her look\r\nobstinately dwelt.\r\n\r\nMinutes slipped away, but Flore did not move. At last, at 7.55, when\r\nMisard with a couple of blasts from his horn signalled the slow train\r\nfrom Havre on the up-line, she rose, closed the gate, and planted\r\nherself before it, her flag in her fist. The train was already fading\r\naway in the distance, after sending a tremor through the ground; and it\r\ncould be heard plunging into the tunnel, where the sound ceased. She\r\nhad not gone back to the bench, but remained on her feet again counting\r\neach minute. If no goods train was signalled within ten minutes, she\r\nwould run over there beyond the cutting, and remove a rail.\r\n\r\nShe was very calm, only her chest felt a little tight under the\r\nenormous weight of the deed. But, at this moment, the thought that\r\nJacques and S\xc3\xa9verine were approaching, that they would pass by again\r\nif she did not stop them, sufficed to make her inexorably blind and\r\ndeaf in her resolution, without even giving the matter any further\r\nconsideration; it was the irrevocable, the blow from the paw of the\r\nshe-wolf that breaks the back of the prey on the way. In the egotism of\r\nher vengeance, she saw only the two mutilated bodies, without troubling\r\nabout the crowd, that stream of unknown people who had been filing past\r\nbefore her for years. There would be dead bodies, blood, the sun would\r\nperhaps be obscured by them, that sun whose tender gaiety irritated her.\r\n\r\nTwo minutes more, one minute more, and she would be starting. Indeed,\r\nshe was starting, when some heavy jolting on the B\xc3\xa9court road stopped\r\nher. A cart, no doubt a stone dray; the carter would ask her to let\r\nhim through. She would have to open the gate, engage in conversation,\r\nand remain there: it would be impossible for her to act, and she would\r\nmiss her chance. With an enraged gesture of indifference, she ran off,\r\nleaving her post, abandoning the carter with his dray to do the best he\r\ncould. But the lash of a whip cracked in the matutinal air, and a voice\r\ncried out gaily:\r\n\r\n"Hey! Flore!"\r\n\r\nIt was Cabuche. She stopped short, in her first spring, before the gate\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n"What\'s up?" he continued. "Are you still asleep with this beautiful\r\nsun shining? Quick! let me get through before the express!"\r\n\r\nShe was completely undone. It was all over. The other two would proceed\r\nto their happiness without her being able to find any means to crush\r\nthem here. And as she slowly opened the old, half-rotten gate, whose\r\nironwork grated in its rust, she looked about her furiously for an\r\nobject, something she could cast across the line; and she was in such\r\ndespair, that she would have stretched her own self there, had she\r\nthought her bones hard enough to send the engine off the metals.\r\n\r\nBut her glance had just fallen on the dray, a heavy, low conveyance,\r\nloaded with two blocks of stone, which five strong horses found\r\ndifficulty in drawing. These two enormous masses, high and broad, a\r\ncolossal lump fit to bar the line, stood there before her; and abruptly\r\na look of covetousness came into her eyes, accompanied by a mad desire\r\nto take and place them on the rails. The gate was wide open, the five\r\nsteaming, panting cattle were there waiting.\r\n\r\n"What is the matter with you this morning?" resumed Cabuche. "You look\r\nquite funny."\r\n\r\nThen Flore spoke.\r\n\r\n"My mother died last night," said she.\r\n\r\nHe uttered a friendly exclamation of grief, and putting down his whip,\r\ntook both her hands and pressed them in his own.\r\n\r\n"Oh! my poor Flore!" he sighed. "It is only what one might have\r\nexpected for a long time, but it is hard all the same. Then she is\r\nthere. I will go and look at her, for we should have ended by agreeing,\r\nbut for this misfortune."\r\n\r\nHe walked slowly with her to the house, but on the threshold he cast a\r\nglance towards his horses. In one sentence she set his mind at rest.\r\n\r\n"There is no fear of them moving," she said. "And, besides, the express\r\nis a long way off."\r\n\r\nShe lied. Her experienced ear had just caught, in the gentle rustle of\r\nthe country, the sound of the express leaving Barentin station. Another\r\nfive minutes, and it would be there. It would issue from the cutting at\r\na hundred yards from the level crossing.\r\n\r\nWhile the quarryman stood in the room of the dead woman, feeling very\r\nmuch affected, with his thoughts adverting to Louisette and oblivious\r\nof everything else, Flore remained outside, in front of the window,\r\nlistening to the distant regular puffing of the engine as it approached\r\nnearer and nearer. Suddenly she remembered Misard: he would see her,\r\nhe would prevent her; and she felt a pang in the chest when, turning\r\nround, she could not perceive him in his box. But she discovered him\r\non the other side of the house, digging up the ground at the foot of\r\nthe masonry round the well, unable to overcome his searching mania, and\r\ndoubtless all at once taken with the conviction that the hoard must be\r\nthere. Entirely absorbed by his blind, sullen passion, he searched,\r\nsearched. And this was her last excitation. Events themselves urged\r\nher on. One of the horses began to neigh, while the locomotive, at the\r\nother end of the cutting, puffed very loudly, like a person hastening\r\nalong in a hurry.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll go and keep them quiet," said Flore to Cabuche. "Don\'t be afraid."\r\n\r\nShe sprang forward, grasped the leader of the team by the bit, and\r\npulled with all her strapping strength of a wrestler. The horses\r\nstrained. For an instant the dray, heavy with its enormous load,\r\noscillated without advancing; but, as if she had harnessed herself to\r\nit like an extra animal, it at last moved and came across the line. It\r\nwas right on the rails as the express, a hundred yards away, issued\r\nfrom the cutting. Then to stop the dray, lest it should pass over, she\r\narrested the further progress of the team with a sudden jerk requiring\r\na superhuman effort that made her joints crack.\r\n\r\nShe who, it will be remembered, had her legend, of whom people related\r\nextraordinary feats of strength--the truck shooting down an incline,\r\nwhich she had brought to a standstill as it ran, the cart she had\r\npushed across the metals, and thus saved from a train--she accomplished\r\nthis action now. In her iron grip she held back those five horses,\r\nrearing and neighing with the instinct of peril.\r\n\r\nBarely ten seconds passed, but they were seconds of inconceivable\r\nterror. The two colossal stones seemed to bar the view. The locomotive\r\ncame gliding along with its pale brass and glittering steel, arriving\r\nat its smooth, fulminating pace in the golden beams of the beautiful\r\nmorning. The inevitable was there, nothing in the world could now\r\nprevent the smash. And the interval seemed interminable.\r\n\r\nMisard, who had bounded back to his box, yelled with his arms in the\r\nair, shaking his fists in the senseless determination to warn the\r\ndriver and stop the train. Cabuche, who had quitted the house at the\r\nsound of the wheels and the neighing of the horses, rushed forward,\r\nalso yelling, to make the animals go on. But Flore, who had flung\r\nherself on one side, restrained him, which saved his life. He fancied\r\nthat she had not been strong enough to master the horses, that it was\r\nthey who had dragged her along. And he taxed himself with carelessness,\r\nsobbing in a splutter of despairing terror; while she, motionless,\r\nstanding at her full height, her eyes like live coal and wide open,\r\nlooked on. At the same moment, as the front of the engine was about to\r\ntouch the blocks of stone, when there remained perhaps only three feet\r\nto run, during this inappreciable time, she distinctly saw Jacques,\r\nwith his hand on the reversing-wheel. He had turned towards her, and\r\ntheir eyes met in a gaze that she found inordinately long.\r\n\r\nOn that particular morning Jacques had smiled at S\xc3\xa9verine, when she\r\ncame down on to the platform at Havre for the express. What was the\r\nuse of spoiling his life with nightmares? Why not take advantage of\r\nthe happy days when they came? All would perhaps come right in the\r\nend. And, resolved to enjoy himself on this day, at all events, he\r\nwas making plans in his head, dreaming of taking her to lunch at a\r\nrestaurant. And so, as she cast him a sorrowful glance, because there\r\nwas not a first-class carriage at the head of the train, and she was\r\nforced to find a seat a long way off him at the end, he wished to\r\nconsole her by smiling merrily. They would arrive together, and make\r\nup for being separated. Indeed, after leaning over the rail to see her\r\nenter a compartment right at the extremity of the train, he had pushed\r\nhis good humour so far as to joke with the headguard, Henri Dauvergne,\r\nwhom he knew to be in love with her.\r\n\r\nThe preceding week he fancied he had noticed that the guard was\r\nbecoming bold, and that she encouraged him, by way of diversion,\r\nrequiring relief from the atrocious existence she had formed for\r\nherself. And Jacques inquired of Henri who it was he had been sending\r\nkisses to in the air on the previous evening, when hiding behind one\r\nof the elms in the entrance yard. This elicited a loud laugh from\r\nPecqueux, engaged in making up the fire of La Lison, which was smoking,\r\nand all ready to set out.\r\n\r\nThe express ran from Havre to Barentin at its regular speed and without\r\nincident. It was Henri who first signalled the dray across the line,\r\nfrom his look-out at the top of his box, on issuing from the cutting.\r\nThe van next to the tender was crammed with luggage, for the train\r\ncarried a large number of passengers, who had landed from a mail-boat\r\nthe previous evening. The headguard, very badly off for space, in the\r\nmidst of this huge pile of trunks and portmanteaux, swaying to and fro\r\nin the vibration, had been standing at his desk classing way-bills; and\r\nthe small bottle of ink, suspended from a nail, never ceased swinging\r\nfrom side to side.\r\n\r\nAfter passing the stations where he put out luggage, he had four or\r\nfive minutes\' writing to do. Two travellers had got down at Barentin,\r\nand he had just got his papers in order, when, ascending and seating\r\nhimself in his look-out, he cast a glance back and front along the line\r\nin accordance with his custom. It was his habit to pass all his spare\r\ntime seated in this glazed sentry-box on the watch. The tender hid the\r\ndriver, but thanks to his elevated position, he could often see further\r\nand sooner than the latter. And so, whilst the train was still bending\r\nround in the cutting, he perceived the obstacle ahead. His astonishment\r\nwas such that, in his terror, he lost command of his limbs, and, for an\r\ninstant, even doubted what he saw. A few seconds were in consequence\r\nlost. The train was already out of the cutting, and a loud cry arose\r\nfrom the engine, when he made up his mind to pull the cord of the\r\nalarm-bell dangling in front of him.\r\n\r\nJacques, at this supreme moment, with his hand on the reversing-wheel,\r\nwas looking without seeing, in a minute of absent-mindedness. He was\r\nthinking of confused and distant matters, from which the image of\r\nS\xc3\xa9verine, even, had faded. The violent swinging and riot of the bell,\r\nthe yells of Pecqueux behind him, brought him back to reality.\r\n\r\nPecqueux, who had raised the rod of the ash-pan, being dissatisfied\r\nwith the draught, had caught sight of the scene on ahead as he leant\r\nover the rail to make sure of the speed. And Jacques, pale as death,\r\nsaw and understood everything: the stone dray across the line, the\r\nengine tearing along, the frightful shock; and he witnessed it all with\r\nsuch penetrating distinctness, that he could even distinguish the\r\ngrain in the two stones, while he already felt the concussion of the\r\nsmash in his bones. He had violently turned round the reversing-wheel,\r\nclosed the regulator, tightened the brake. He had reversed the engine,\r\nand was hanging unconsciously with one hand to the whistle handle, in\r\nthe furious, but impotent determination to give warning, to have the\r\ncolossal barricade in front removed.\r\n\r\nBut in the middle of this terrible scream of distress that rent the\r\nair, La Lison refused to obey. It continued its course in spite of all,\r\nbarely slackening in speed. Since it had lost its power of starting off\r\nsmoothly and its excellent vaporisation, in the snowstorm, it was no\r\nlonger the docile engine of former days. It had now become whimsical\r\nand intractable, like an old woman with her chest ruined by a chill. It\r\npanted, resisted the brake, and still went on and on, in the ponderous\r\nobstinacy of its huge mass. Pecqueux, maddened with fright, sprang\r\noff. Jacques waited, inflexible, at his post, with the fingers of his\r\nright hand clutching the reversing-wheel, and those of his left resting\r\non the whistle handle, unaware of what he was doing. And La Lison,\r\nsmoking, puffing, amidst this piercing screech that never ceased,\r\ndashed against the stone dray with the enormous weight of the thirteen\r\ncarriages it dragged behind it.\r\n\r\nThen, eighty feet distant, beside the line, where they stood riveted\r\nin terror, Misard and Cabuche with their arms in the air, Flore with\r\nher eyes starting from her head, witnessed this frightful scene:\r\nthe front part of the train rising up almost perpendicularly, seven\r\ncarriages ascending one on the top of the other, to fall back with an\r\nabominable crash in a confused downfall of wreckage. The first three\r\ncarriages were reduced to atoms, the four others formed a mountain,\r\nan entanglement of staved-in roofs, broken wheels, doors, chains,\r\nbuffers, interspersed with pieces of glass. And what had been heard\r\nparticularly, was the pounding of the machine against the stones--a\r\nheavy crash terminating in a cry of agony. La Lison, ripped open,\r\ntoppled over to the left, on the other side of the stone dray; while\r\nthe stones, split asunder, flew about in splinters as in the explosion\r\nof a mine, and four out of the five horses, bowled over and dragged\r\nalong the ground, were killed on the spot. The back half of the\r\ntrain, comprising six carriages, remained intact. They had come to a\r\nstandstill without even leaving the metals.\r\n\r\nCries arose from the wreckage, appeals in words that were drowned by\r\ninarticulate howls, like those of wild beasts.\r\n\r\n"Help! help! Oh! my God! I am dying! Help! help!"\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the riot and confusion of the smash, nothing could\r\nbe heard or seen distinctly. La Lison, thrown over on the side, the\r\nunder part rent open, was losing steam in rumbling puffs, similar to a\r\nfurious rattle in the throat of a giant, at places where taps had been\r\ntorn away, and where pipes had burst. An inexhaustible white cloud of\r\nvapour rolled round and round just on a level with the ground; while\r\nthe embers, red as blood, fallen from the fire-box, added their black\r\nsmoke. The chimney, in the violence of the shock, had entered the\r\nground. At the place where it had stood, the frame was broken, bending\r\nthe two frame-plates; and with the wheels in the air, similar to a\r\nmonstrous steed, torn open by some formidable rip of a horn, La Lison\r\ndisplayed its twisted connecting-rods, its broken cylinders, its slide\r\nvalves and their eccentrics flattened out--one huge, frightful wound,\r\ngaping in the open air, whence vitality continued issuing with the\r\nfracas of enraged despair. Beside the locomotive lay the horse, which\r\nhad not been killed at once, with his two fore hoofs cut off and his\r\nbelly ripped up. By his erect head, the neck stiffened in a spasm of\r\natrocious pain, he could be perceived rattling the death agony with a\r\nterrible neigh, which failed to reach the ear in the thunder of the\r\nagonising engine.\r\n\r\nThe cries were stifled, unheard, lost, wafted away.\r\n\r\n"Save me! Kill me! I am suffering too atrociously. Kill me! Kill me at\r\nonce!"\r\n\r\nIn this deafening tumult, and blinding smoke, the doors of the\r\ncarriages remaining intact opened, and a swarm of bewildered travellers\r\nsprang out. Falling down on the line, they struggled with feet and\r\nfists to rise again. Then as soon as they found themselves on firm\r\nground, with the open country before them, they fled as fast as they\r\ncould run, clearing the hedge, cutting across country, ceding to the\r\nsole instinct of getting far away from the danger, very, very far.\r\nHowling women and men disappeared in the depths of the woods.\r\n\r\nS\xc3\xa9verine, trampled under foot, with her hair about her back and her\r\ngown in shreds, at last got free; but she did not flee. Running towards\r\nthe roaring engine, she found herself face to face with Pecqueux.\r\n\r\n"Jacques! Jacques! He is safe, is he not?" she inquired.\r\n\r\nThe fireman, who, by a miracle, had not even sprained a joint, was\r\nhurrying in the same direction, his heart swelling with pity at the\r\nidea of his driver being beneath that heap of wreckage. They had\r\njourneyed, they had suffered so much together in the continual fatigue\r\nof the high winds! And their engine, their poor engine, the good friend\r\nso cherished by both, which lay there on its back, losing its last\r\nbreath of steam!\r\n\r\n"I jumped off," he stammered, "and know nothing, nothing at all. Come\r\non, come on, quick!"\r\n\r\nBeside the line they ran up against Flore, who had been watching them\r\nadvancing towards her. Stupefied at the act she had committed, at the\r\nmassacre she had accomplished, she had not yet moved. It was all over,\r\nand it was well. Her only feeling was one of relief at having performed\r\na necessity, without the least thought of pity for the pain of the\r\nother victims, whom she did not even notice. But when she recognised\r\nS\xc3\xa9verine, her eyes opened immeasurably wide, and a cloud of frightful\r\nsuffering darkened her pale countenance. Eh? what? this woman lived,\r\nwhen he was certainly dead! This piercing grief at her assassinated\r\nlove, at this stab which she had given herself right in the heart,\r\nabruptly revealed to her all the abomination of her crime. She had\r\ndone this, she had killed him, she had killed all these people! A loud\r\ncry lacerated her throat, she twisted her arms, she ran madly forward,\r\nexclaiming:\r\n\r\n"Jacques, oh! Jacques! He is there. He was thrown backward, I saw him.\r\nJacques, Jacques!" she called.\r\n\r\nThe death rattle of La Lison had become subdued. It had taken the form\r\nof a hoarse moan which grew weaker and weaker, and the increasing\r\nclamour of the wounded could now be heard in tones more and more\r\nheartrending. The smoke remained thick. The enormous heap of wreckage,\r\nwhence issued the voices of the tortured and terrified beings, seemed\r\nenveloped in a black cloud of dust that remained motionless in the sun.\r\nWhat could be done? Where commence? How could these wretched victims be\r\nreached?\r\n\r\n"Jacques!" Flore continued calling. "I tell you he looked at me," she\r\nadded, "and that he was thrown off there, under the tender. Come along\r\nquickly! Help me!"\r\n\r\nCabuche and Misard had just picked up Henri, the headguard, who at\r\nthe last second had also leapt from the train. He had dislocated his\r\nankle, and they seated him on the ground against the hedge, where,\r\nhalf-stunned and mute, he watched the rescue of the passengers without\r\nappearing to suffer.\r\n\r\n"Cabuche, come and help me!" cried Flore; "I tell you, Jacques is under\r\nthere!"\r\n\r\nThe quarryman did not hear her. He ran to the assistance of the other\r\nwounded, and carried away a young woman whose legs were dangling down\r\nbroken.\r\n\r\nIt was S\xc3\xa9verine who rushed forward to answer the appeal of Flore.\r\n\r\n"Jacques, Jacques?" said she inquiringly. "Where is he? I will help\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"That\'s it, help me, you!"\r\n\r\nTheir hands met. Together they tugged at a broken wheel. But the\r\ndelicate fingers of S\xc3\xa9verine could do nothing, while the other with her\r\nsturdy fists broke through the obstacles.\r\n\r\n"Be careful!" said Pecqueux, who also began to assist in the work.\r\n\r\nAnd he sharply stopped S\xc3\xa9verine just as she was going to tread on an\r\narm cut off at the shoulder, which was still clothed in a blue cloth\r\nsleeve. She started back in horror. And yet she did not recognise the\r\nsleeve. It was an unknown arm that had rolled there from a body they\r\nwould doubtless find elsewhere. This gave her such a fit of trembling\r\nthat she seemed as if paralysed, standing weeping, watching the others\r\nworking, incapable even of removing the splinters of glass which cut\r\nher hands.\r\n\r\nThen the rescue of the dying, the search for the dead proved full\r\nof anguish and danger, for the live coal had set the pieces of wood\r\nalight, and to put a stop to this commencement of a fire it became\r\nnecessary to throw shovels of earth over them. While someone ran to\r\nBarentin to ask for assistance, and a telegram left for Rouen, the\r\nremoval of the wreckage proceeded as briskly as possible, everyone\r\nputting a hand to the work with great courage. Many of the runaways\r\nhad returned, ashamed of their panic. But the relief party had to\r\nadvance with infinite precautions, the transfer of each bit of wreckage\r\nrequiring the utmost care, for fears were entertained lest the heap\r\nmight perchance collapse and finish off the poor wretches in its midst.\r\nSome of the wounded emerged from the pile, still buried up to their\r\nchests, crushed as if in a vice, and howling. The rescuers laboured\r\na quarter of an hour to deliver one victim as white as a sheet, who,\r\nfar from complaining, said he felt no pain, and had nothing the matter\r\nwith him; but when he had been extricated, he was found to be without\r\nhis legs, and expired immediately, having neither seen nor felt the\r\nhorrible mutilation in his fit of fright.\r\n\r\nAn entire family were dragged from a second-class compartment that\r\nhad caught fire: the father and mother wounded in the knees, the\r\ngrandmother with a broken arm; but neither did they feel their\r\ninjuries. They were sobbing and calling their little girl who had\r\ndisappeared in the smash--a fair-headed mite, barely three years old,\r\nwho was discovered safe and sound under a strip of roofing with a\r\nmerry, smiling face. Another little girl drenched in blood and with her\r\npoor, tiny hands crushed, had been carried aside pending the discovery\r\nof her parents. She remained alone and unknown, breathing with such\r\ndifficulty that she could not utter a word; but her face was convulsed\r\ninto an expression of ineffable terror as soon as anyone approached her.\r\n\r\nThe shock having twisted the iron-fittings of the carriage doors, it\r\nwas found impossible to open them, and it became necessary to enter the\r\ncompartments through the broken glass. Four corpses had already been\r\ntaken out and placed side by side along the line. About ten wounded\r\nextended on the ground, were waiting near the dead bodies, there\r\nbeing no doctor to dress their wounds, and no assistance of any kind.\r\nThe clearance of the wreckage had barely commenced, and a new victim\r\nwas found under each bit of lumber, while the heap, streaming and\r\npalpitating with this human butchery, never seemed to decrease.\r\n\r\n"But I tell you that Jacques is under there!" cried Flore, relieving\r\nherself by obstinately repeating this expression, which she uttered\r\nwithout reason, as the lamentation of her despair. "He is calling.\r\nThere, there! Listen!" she added.\r\n\r\nThe tender lay buried beneath the carriages, which after running one\r\natop of the other, had then tumbled over; and, in fact, since the\r\nlocomotive had been making less noise, a heavy masculine voice could be\r\ndistinguished roaring in the midst of the pile. As the work advanced\r\nthe clamour of these agonising tones became more subdued, but they\r\nrevealed such atrocious pain that the rescue party, unable to bear them\r\nany longer, gave way and called out themselves. Then, at last, when the\r\nexcavators reached the victim whose legs they had liberated, and whom\r\nthey were dragging towards them, the roar of suffering ceased. The man\r\nwas dead!\r\n\r\n"No," said Flore, "it is not Jacques. He is lower down. He is\r\nunderneath."\r\n\r\nAnd with her arms of a warrior woman, she raised the wheels and cast\r\nthem to a distance, she twirled the zinc of the roofs, broke the doors,\r\ntore away the bits of chain. And as soon as she came to a corpse or\r\na person who was wounded, she called for someone to remove the body,\r\ndetermined not to slacken for a second in her maddening search.\r\n\r\nCabuche, Pecqueux, and Misard worked behind her, while S\xc3\xa9verine,\r\nenfeebled by standing so long on her feet, had just seated herself on\r\nthe bench of a shattered carriage. But Misard, gentle and indifferent,\r\nagain overcome by his sluggishness, anxious to avoid too much fatigue,\r\nwas always ready to carry away the bodies. And both he and Flore looked\r\nat the corpses, as if they hoped to recognise them from among the\r\nmultitude of thousands and thousands of faces who, in ten years, had\r\nfiled past before their eyes at full steam, leaving only the confused\r\nrecollection of a crowd conveyed there and borne away in a flash.\r\n\r\nNo; it was still that unknown wave of the advancing world, as anonymous\r\nin brutal, accidental death, as in that hasty life which brought it\r\ntearing past them onward to the future; and they could not name, they\r\ncould give no information about the heads, furrowed with horror, of\r\nthese poor creatures struck down on their road, trampled under foot,\r\nsimilar to those soldiers whose bodies fill the trenches in opposing\r\nthe charge of an enemy ascending to the assault. Nevertheless, Flore\r\nfancied she had found one person to whom she had spoken on the day\r\nthe train was blocked in the snow: that American whose profile she\r\nhad at last come to know familiarly, without being aware of his name,\r\nor anything about him or his. Misard carried him along with the other\r\ndead bodies, come no one knew whence, bound for no one knew where, and\r\nstopped there.\r\n\r\nThen came a heartrending scene: in a first-class compartment turned\r\ntopsy-turvy they had just discovered a young couple, doubtless newly\r\nmarried, thrown one upon the other in such an unfortunate position\r\nthat the woman, who was uppermost, crushed the man, and could not\r\nmake a movement to relieve him. He was choking, he already had the\r\ndeath rattle in his throat; while she, in terror, with her mouth\r\nfree, her heart rent asunder at the thought that she was killing him,\r\ndistractedly implored the relief party to make haste. And when they\r\nhad delivered both, it was she who all at once breathed her last, a\r\nblow from one of the buffers having ripped open her side. And the man,\r\ncoming to himself again, clamoured with grief, kneeling beside the dead\r\nbody whose eyes remained full of tears.\r\n\r\nA dozen corpses and about thirty wounded passengers had now been\r\nremoved. The workers were setting the tender free. Flore paused, ever\r\nand anon, thrusting her head among the splintered wood, the twisted\r\niron, searching ardently with her eyes to see if she could perceive the\r\ndriver. Suddenly she uttered a loud cry.\r\n\r\n"I can see him!" she exclaimed. "He is under here. Look! There is his\r\narm, with his blue woollen jacket. He doesn\'t move; he doesn\'t breathe!"\r\n\r\nAnd, rising from her recumbent position, she swore like a man.\r\n\r\n"Be quick!" she shouted with an oath. "Get him out from there!"\r\n\r\nShe made a fruitless effort with both hands to tear away a plank\r\nbelonging to one of the carriages, which other pieces of wreckage\r\nprevented coming towards her. So, running off, she returned with the\r\nhatchet that served to chop the wood at home; and brandishing it as a\r\nwoodcutter wields his axe in the middle of an oak-tree forest, she fell\r\nupon the plank with a volley of furious blows. The men, standing aside,\r\nallowed her to do as she would, while shouting to her to be careful.\r\nBut Jacques was the only wounded person there, and he lay sheltered\r\nunder an entanglement of axle-trees and wheels. Moreover, she paid no\r\nattention to what was said. Her spirit being fairly roused, certain of\r\nherself, she proceeded with irresistible determination. Each stroke\r\nbattered down the wood, cut through an obstacle. With her fair hair\r\nstreaming free, her bodice torn open displaying her bare arms, she\r\nresembled some terrible reaper cleaving a way through the destruction\r\nshe had wrought. The final blow falling upon an axletree, broke the\r\niron of the hatchet in two. Then, assisted by the others, she put aside\r\nthe wheels which had protected the young man from being crushed to\r\ndeath, and she was the first to seize him and bear him away in her arms.\r\n\r\n"Jacques, Jacques!" she cried. "He is alive; he is breathing. Ah! Great\r\nGod! he lives. I knew I saw him fall, and that he was there!"\r\n\r\nS\xc3\xa9verine, who was distracted, followed her. Between them they laid\r\nhim down at the foot of the hedge beside Henri, who continued gazing,\r\nstupefied, as if not understanding where he was, nor what went on\r\naround him. Pecqueux, who had approached, remained standing before his\r\ndriver quite unhinged at seeing him in this deplorable state; while the\r\ntwo women, now kneeling down, one to the right the other to the left,\r\nsupported the head of the poor fellow, watching in anguish for the\r\nslightest shiver on his face.\r\n\r\nAt length Jacques opened his lids. His troubled look fell upon Flore\r\nand S\xc3\xa9verine, one after the other, but he did not appear to recognise\r\nthem. They failed to arouse his interest. But his eyes having\r\nencountered the expiring locomotive, a few feet away, first of all\r\nassumed a wild expression, then, settling on the object, vacillated\r\nwith increasing emotion.\r\n\r\nHe recognised La Lison well, and the sight brought everything back to\r\nhim: the two blocks of stone across the rails, the abominable shock,\r\nthe crushing sensation he had experienced, at the same moment, within\r\nboth the engine and himself, and from which he had emerged alive, while\r\nthe locomotive had assuredly come to an end. It was not the fault of\r\nthe engine if it had been intractable; for it had always felt the\r\neffects of the accident in the snow; without counting, that age makes\r\nlimbs heavy and joints stiff, which is as applicable to machinery as\r\nto living creatures. And so, overwhelmed with grief at seeing La Lison\r\ndirefully wounded, in the last throes of death, he readily forgave.\r\n\r\nPoor La Lison had but a few minutes more. It was becoming cold. The\r\nlive coal in the fire-box was turning into cinders, the steam that had\r\nescaped in such violence from its open flanks, was exhausting itself\r\nwith the low moan of a weeping child. The locomotive always so bright,\r\nnow lay on its back in a black bed of coal, soiled with earth and foam.\r\nIt had met with the tragic end of a costly animal struck down in the\r\npublic street. At one moment, it had been possible to perceive its\r\nmechanism at work through its shattered plates: the pistons beating\r\nlike twin-hearts, the steam circulating in the slide valves as the\r\nblood of its veins; but the connecting-rods merely moved in a jerky\r\nfashion, after the manner of convulsive human arms, and constituted the\r\nfinal efforts of life.\r\n\r\nIts spirit was ebbing away along with the power that gave it life,\r\nthat huge breath whereof it could not absolutely free itself. The\r\neviscerated giantess sank lower still, passing little by little into\r\nvery gentle slumber, and ended by emitting not a sound. La Lison was\r\ndead. And the heap of iron, steel, and copper, lying there, this\r\npounded colossal mass with the barrel ripped asunder, the scattered\r\nlimbs, the interior mechanism smashed, exposed to broad daylight,\r\ndisplayed the frightfully mournful aspect of some enormous human\r\ncorpse, of a whole world that had lived, and from which life had just\r\nbeen torn in anguish.\r\n\r\nThen Jacques, understanding that La Lison was no more, closed his eyes,\r\ndesiring to die also; moreover, he was so weak that he fancied himself\r\nborne away in the final little puff of the engine; and tears, trickling\r\nfrom his closed lids, drenched his cheeks. This was too much for\r\nPecqueux who had remained there motionless with a lump in his throat.\r\nTheir dear friend had gone, and here was his driver wishing to follow.\r\nSo the happy family of three was at an end. All over those journeys\r\nof hundreds of leagues they made together without exchanging a word,\r\nand yet all three understanding one another so well, that they had no\r\nneed to make even a sign to comprehend. Ah! poor La Lison, as gentle\r\nas strong, so beautiful when sparkling in the sun! And Pecqueux, who,\r\nnevertheless, had not been drinking, burst into violent sobs, unable to\r\nmaster the hiccoughs that agitated his huge frame.\r\n\r\nS\xc3\xa9verine and Flore were also in despair at this fresh fainting fit\r\nof Jacques. The latter of the two women running home, returned with\r\ncamphorated spirit, and began to friction him for the sake of doing\r\nsomething. But amidst their anguish they were exasperated by the\r\ninterminable death agony of the horse, who had his two fore-hoofs cut\r\noff, the only survivor of the team of five. He lay close to them,\r\nuttering a constant neigh, a cry that sounded almost human. It was so\r\nshrill and so expressive of frightful pain, that two of the wounded\r\ngained by the contagion, also began howling like animals.\r\n\r\nNever had a death-cry rent the air in such a deep, ever memorable\r\ncomplaint. It made the blood run icy cold. The torture became\r\natrocious. Voices, trembling with pity and anger, inveighed against\r\nit, beseeching the rescue party to put an end to the misery of this\r\nwretched horse, who was in such terrible suffering, and whose endless\r\ndeath rattle, now that the engine had expired, continued like the final\r\nlamentation of the catastrophe. Then Pecqueux, still sobbing, picked up\r\nthe hatchet with the shattered steel head, and at a single blow, right\r\nin front of the skull, pole-axed him. Silence now fell on the scene of\r\nmassacre.\r\n\r\nAssistance came at last, after waiting a couple of hours. In the shock\r\nof the collision the carriages had all been thrown to the left, so that\r\nthe down-line could be cleared in a few hours. A train from Rouen,\r\nconsisting of three carriages and a pilot-engine, had just brought the\r\nchief-secretary to the Prefect and the Imperial Procurator, along with\r\nsome engineers and doctors of the company--quite a swarm of active,\r\nbusy personages; while M. Bessi\xc3\xa8re, the station-master at Barentin, was\r\nalready attacking the wreckage with a gang of workmen.\r\n\r\nExtraordinary bustle and excitement prevailed in this out-of-the-way\r\nplace, usually so silent and deserted. The travellers, who had issued\r\nfrom the accident safe and sound, had not yet lost the frenzy of\r\ntheir panic, which asserted itself in a febrile necessity to keep on\r\nthe move. Some, terrified at the idea of again seating themselves in\r\na railway carriage, endeavoured to hire vehicles; others, seeing it\r\nwas impossible to find even a wheel-barrow, already became anxious\r\nabout eating and sleeping. Everybody wished to send off telegrams, and\r\nseveral people set out for Barentin on foot taking messages with them.\r\n\r\nWhile the representatives of the government, assisted by the\r\nservants of the railway company, commenced an inquiry, the doctors\r\nhastily proceeded to dress the wounds of the injured. Many had lost\r\nconsciousness and lay in pools of blood. Others, tortured by tweezers\r\nand needles, murmured in feeble voices. Altogether there were fifteen\r\npassengers killed and thirty-two seriously hurt. The corpses remained\r\nin a row on the ground at the foot of the hedge, with their faces to\r\nthe sky pending identification.\r\n\r\nNo one, save a little substitute, a fair and rosy young man full of\r\nzeal, troubled about them. And he searched their pockets to see if he\r\ncould find any papers, visiting-cards, or letters, which would enable\r\nhim to ticket each of them with a name and address. Meanwhile, a\r\ngaping crowd had gathered about him; for, although there was no house\r\nwithin a league around, a number of idlers had arrived, no one could\r\nsay whence--some thirty men, women, and children, who simply stood in\r\nthe way without lending any assistance. And the black dust, the veil\r\nof smoke and vapour that had enveloped everything, having dispersed,\r\nthe radiant April morning burst triumphant upon the scene of massacre,\r\nbathing the dead and dying, the ripped-up La Lison, and the pile of\r\nwreckage, in gentle, gay streams of bright sun; while the gang of\r\nworkmen engaged in clearing the line reminded one of ants repairing the\r\ndamage done to their hill by the feet of a thoughtless passer-by.\r\n\r\nJacques continued unconscious, and S\xc3\xa9verine, stopping a doctor as he\r\ncame along, besought his assistance. The latter examined the young man\r\nwithout discovering any visible wound, but fearing internal lesions on\r\naccount of the thin streaks of blood that appeared between his lips, he\r\ndeclined to express a formal opinion, but advised that Jacques should\r\nbe removed as speedily, and with as little jolting as possible, and put\r\nto bed.\r\n\r\nJacques, at the touch of hands passing over him, had again opened his\r\neyes with a suppressed ejaculation of pain. This time he recognised\r\nS\xc3\xa9verine, and stammered in a wandering manner:\r\n\r\n"Take me away--take me away!"\r\n\r\nFlore bent forward, and Jacques moving his head recognised her also.\r\nHis eyes at once took the terrified expression of a child, and he\r\nturned back towards S\xc3\xa9verine, shrinking from the other with a look of\r\nhatred and horror.\r\n\r\n"Take me away, immediately, immediately!" said he.\r\n\r\nThen S\xc3\xa9verine, troubling no more about Flore than if she had not been\r\npresent, inquired in a most affectionate tone:\r\n\r\n"Will you let me take you to La Croix-de-Maufras? It is just opposite;\r\nand if you consent we shall be at home there."\r\n\r\nAnd still agitated, with his eyes fixed on the other, he acquiesced.\r\n\r\n"Anywhere you please, immediately," said he.\r\n\r\nFlore, who remained motionless, turned pale as death at his look of\r\nterrified execration. And so, in this carnage of innocent people, she\r\nhad not succeeded in killing them, neither the one nor the other: the\r\nwoman had come out of it without a scratch; and now he would perhaps\r\nescape. She had only succeeded in throwing them together all alone in\r\nthis solitary house. She saw them comfortable there, the sweetheart\r\nrecovered, convalescent; the girl full of attention, recompensed for\r\nher vigils by continual caresses, both prolonging the honeymoon of the\r\ncatastrophe in absolute liberty and far from the world. She turned icy\r\ncold, and cast her eyes on the dead she had slaughtered to no purpose.\r\n\r\nAt this moment, Flore, in the glance she had given to the butchery,\r\nperceived Misard and Cabuche, who were being questioned by some\r\ngentlemen--the judicial authorities assuredly. In fact, the Imperial\r\nProcurator and the chief secretary to the Prefect were endeavouring\r\nto ascertain how this stone dray had got across the line. Misard\r\nmaintained that he had not left his post, while at the same time, he\r\nwas unable to give any precise information as to what had happened.\r\nHe really knew nothing, so he pretended he had been busy with his\r\napparatus, and had his back turned.\r\n\r\nCabuche, who had not yet recovered his composure, related a long,\r\nconfused story about how he had committed the imprudence of leaving\r\nhis team, in order to take a look at the corpse of the dead woman, how\r\nthe horses had moved on alone, and how the young girl had been unable\r\nto stop them. Embroiling himself, he began again without succeeding in\r\nmaking himself understood.\r\n\r\nA mad desire for liberty, again caused the frozen blood of Flore\r\nto flow warm. She wished for freedom of action, freedom to reflect\r\nand come to a decision of her own accord, having never required the\r\nassistance of anyone to get into the right path. What was the good of\r\nwaiting to be annoyed with questions, perhaps to be arrested? For,\r\napart from the crime, there had been neglect of duty, and she would be\r\nheld responsible. Nevertheless, she remained where she was, feeling\r\nunable to quit the spot so long as Jacques stayed there.\r\n\r\nS\xc3\xa9verine had so begged and prayed of Pecqueux to procure a stretcher,\r\nthat he at last secured one, and returned from his errand with a\r\ncomrade, to carry off the injured driver. The doctor had persuaded the\r\nyoung woman to allow Henri, the headguard, to be accommodated at her\r\nhouse also. He merely seemed to be suffering from swimming in the head,\r\nas if momentarily struck senseless by the shock. He would be removed\r\nafter the other one.\r\n\r\nAs S\xc3\xa9verine bent forward to unbutton the collar of Jacques which was\r\ntroubling him, she kissed him openly on the eyes, wishing to give him\r\ncourage to support being moved.\r\n\r\n"Never mind," she murmured; "we shall be happy."\r\n\r\nHe returned her kiss smiling. And to Flore this was the supreme rent\r\nthat tore him from her for ever. It seemed to her that her blood, also,\r\nwas now flowing from an incurable wound. She fled when they carried\r\nhim away; but, in passing before the low habitation, she perceived the\r\ndeath-chamber through the window, with the pale spot formed by the\r\ncandle burning in broad daylight, beside the body of her mother. During\r\nthe accident the corpse of the dead woman had remained alone, with the\r\nhead half turned aside, the eyes wide open, the mouth twisted, as if\r\nshe were watching all these people whom she did not know, being crushed\r\nto death.\r\n\r\nFlore dashed away, and immediately turning the corner formed by the\r\nDoinville road, struck out to the left among the bushes. She was\r\nfamiliar with every innermost corner of the district, and she could now\r\ndefy the gendarmes to catch her should they happen to be in pursuit.\r\nSo she abruptly ceased running, continuing at a slow walk towards\r\na hiding-place--an excavation above the tunnel, where she loved to\r\nconceal herself on days when she felt sad. Raising her eyes, she saw\r\nby the sun that it was noon. When she was in her den, she stretched\r\nherself on the hard rock, and remained motionless with her hands\r\nclasped behind her neck reflecting. It was not until then that she\r\nfelt a frightful void within her. A sensation of being dead gradually\r\nnumbed her limbs. This was not remorse at having uselessly slaughtered\r\nall these people, for it required an effort on her part to experience\r\nregret and horror at what she had done.\r\n\r\nNo, but she was now certain that Jacques had seen her holding back\r\nthe horses; and she had just understood, as she noticed him shrink\r\naway, that he felt the same terrified repulsion for her as one has for\r\nmonsters. He would never forget. However, when you miss doing away\r\nwith other people, you must not commit the same blunder with yourself.\r\nBy-and-by, she would put an end to her existence. She had no other\r\nhope. She felt the absolute necessity of resorting to this extremity,\r\nsince she had been there, recovering calm and reasoning. Her fatigue\r\nand complete prostration alone prevented her rising to seek a weapon,\r\nand die there and then.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, from the midst of the invincible somnolence that settled on\r\nher, again came the love of life, a craving for felicity, a final dream\r\nof being happy also, considering she had left the other two to the\r\nbliss of living freely together. Why not await night, to run off and\r\njoin Ozil, who adored her and would very well know how to defend her?\r\nThen her thoughts became gentle and confused, and she fell into a sound\r\nsleep, free from dreams.\r\n\r\nWhen Flore awoke, night had completely set in. Not knowing where\r\nshe was, she felt about her, and at once remembered everything, on\r\ntouching the naked rock whereon she lay. Then the implacable necessity\r\npresented itself like a thunderbolt: she must die. It seemed as if that\r\ncowardly sensation of gentleness, that faltering when life seemed still\r\npossible, had vanished with the fatigue. No, no; death alone was good.\r\nShe could not live in the midst of all this blood, with her tattered\r\nheart, and execrated by the only man she cared for, who belonged to\r\nanother. Now that she had the strength, she must die.\r\n\r\nFlore rose, and left the hole in the rocks. She did not hesitate, for\r\ninstinct had just told her where she should go. Looking towards the\r\nstars, she could see it was close on nine o\'clock. As she reached the\r\nrailway, a train flew by at full speed, on the down-line, which seemed\r\nto give her pleasure: all would be well. Evidently they had cleared\r\nthis line, whereas the other, no doubt, was still blocked, for the\r\ntrains did not seem to be running. Now she followed the hedge amidst\r\nthe deadly silence of the wild surroundings. There was no hurry, there\r\nwould be no train before the Paris express, and that would not be there\r\nuntil 9.25. She continued her walk in the dense darkness very calmly,\r\nand at short strides, as if she had been making one of her usual\r\nexcursions by the deserted pathways of the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, before coming to the tunnel, she made her way through the\r\nhedge, and advanced along the metals themselves, at her dawdling gait,\r\nwalking to meet the express. She had to keep her wits about her, so as\r\nnot to be seen by the watchman, as was her custom each time she ran\r\nover on a visit to Ozil. And, in the tunnel, she continued walking,\r\nstill, still advancing. But it was not as on the last occasion. She was\r\nno longer afraid, should she turn round, of losing the exact notion\r\nof the direction she wished to take. The tunnel folly was not beating\r\nin her skull, obliterating all idea of time and space, amidst the\r\nthunder of the sounds crashing beneath the vault. What mattered it to\r\nher? She did not reason, she did not even think, she had but one fixed\r\nresolution: to walk, walk before her until she met the train, and then\r\nto still walk on, straight to the lantern, as soon as she should see it\r\nflaming in the night.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Flore felt astonished, for she fancied she had been going\r\nalong thus for hours. What a distance it was, this death that she\r\ndesired! The idea that she would not encounter it, that she would walk\r\nleagues and leagues without striking against it, caused her momentary\r\ndespair. Her feet were becoming weary. Would she then be obliged to\r\nsit down, and wait for death? To lie across the rails? But this struck\r\nher as unworthy. With the instinct of a virgin and warrior woman, she\r\nwished to walk on to the end, to die erect. And this thought aroused\r\nher energy. She gave another spurt forward, and, in the far distance,\r\nperceived the light of the express, looking like a little star,\r\ntwinkling and alone, in the midst of an inky sky.\r\n\r\nThe train was not yet beneath the vault. No sound announced its coming.\r\nNothing was visible but this very bright, gay light, increasing little\r\nby little in volume. Drawn up to her full, tall height, in all the\r\nsuppleness of her build, evenly balanced on her strong lower limbs, she\r\nnow advanced at a long stride, but without running, as if going to meet\r\na friend to whom she wished to spare a part of the distance separating\r\nthem. But the train had just entered the tunnel, the frightful roar\r\napproached, shaking the ground with a tempestuous blast; while the star\r\nhad become an enormous eye, ever expanding, bursting out as if from its\r\norbit of gloom.\r\n\r\nThen, under the empire of an inexplicable sentiment, perhaps to die\r\nquite alone, she emptied her pockets without pausing in her heroic,\r\nobstinate march, and placed quite a little pile of articles beside\r\nthe line: a pocket-handkerchief, some keys, some string, a couple of\r\nknives; she even removed the fichu tied round her neck, leaving her\r\nbodice unhooked and torn half open.\r\n\r\nThe eye changed into a brazier, into the mouth of an oven vomiting\r\nfire. The breath of the monster already reached her, damp and warm,\r\nin the roll of thunder that became more and more deafening. And she\r\ncontinued to walk on, going straight towards the furnace so as not\r\nto miss the engine, fascinated like some night insect attracted by\r\na flame. And in the frightful shock, in the embrace, she still drew\r\nherself up, as if stirred by the final revolt of a wrestler woman, she\r\nsought to clasp the giant, and lay him low. Her head went full into the\r\nlantern which was extinguished.\r\n\r\nIt was more than an hour afterwards that a party came to pick up the\r\ncorpse of Flore. The driver had distinctly seen the tall, pale-faced\r\nfigure of this girl advancing towards the engine, with all the strange\r\naspect of a terrifying apparition, in the deluge of vivid light that\r\nstreamed upon her; and, when the lantern abruptly went out, and the\r\ntrain rolled along with its peal of thunder in dense obscurity, he\r\nshuddered as he felt death pass by. On issuing from the tunnel he did\r\nhis best to inform the watchman of the accident, by shouting to him.\r\nBut only at Barentin could he relate that somebody had just been cut in\r\ntwo down the line. It was certainly a woman for female hair, mingled\r\nwith bits of skull, still remained sticking to the broken glass of the\r\nlamp.\r\n\r\nAnd when the men sent to look for the body discovered it, they started\r\nto find it so white--as white as marble. It was lying on the up-line,\r\nthrown there by the violence of the shock: the head all pulp, the limbs\r\nwithout a scratch, and half bare, displaying admirable beauty in their\r\npurity and strength. The men wrapped up the corpse in silence. They\r\nhad recognised it. She had certainly done away with herself in a fit of\r\ncraziness, to escape the terrible responsibility weighing on her.\r\n\r\nAt midnight the corpse of Flore rested in the little, low habitation\r\nbeside that of her mother. A mattress had been spread on the ground,\r\nand a candle lighted between the two bodies. The great fixed eyes of\r\nAunt Phasie, whose head remained inclined on her shoulder, and whose\r\ntwisted mouth still bore its hideous grin, seemed now to be gazing\r\nat her daughter; while all around in the solitude, amid the profound\r\nsilence could be heard the grim labour--the panting efforts of Misard,\r\nwho had resumed his search.\r\n\r\nAnd at the prescribed intervals, the trains flew by, crossing one\r\nanother on the two lines, the traffic having just been completely\r\nrestored. They passed inexorably and indifferently with their\r\nall-powerful mechanism, ignorant of these dramas and these crimes.\r\nWhat mattered the unknown of the multitude fallen on the road, crushed\r\nbeneath the wheels? The dead had been removed, the blood washed away,\r\nand the trains started off again for yonder, towards the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe scene shifted to the bedroom at La Croix-de-Maufras, the room hung\r\nin red damask, with the two high windows looking on the railway line\r\na few yards away. From the bedstead--an old four-poster facing the\r\nwindows--the trains could be seen passing. And not an object had been\r\nremoved, not a piece of furniture disturbed for years.\r\n\r\nS\xc3\xa9verine had the wounded Jacques, who was unconscious, carried up to\r\nthis apartment; while Henri Dauvergne was left in a smaller bedroom\r\non the ground floor. For herself, she kept a room close to the one\r\noccupied by Jacques, and only separated from it by the landing. A\r\ncouple of hours sufficed to make everything sufficiently comfortable,\r\nfor the house had remained fully set up, and even linen was stowed away\r\nin the cupboards. S\xc3\xa9verine, with an apron over her gown, found herself\r\ntransformed into a lady nurse. She had simply telegraphed to Roubaud\r\nnot to expect her, as she would no doubt remain at the house a short\r\ntime, attending to the wounded she had put up there.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, the doctor announced that he thought he could\r\nanswer for Jacques, indeed he hoped to put him on his feet again in a\r\nweek; his case proved a perfect miracle, for he had barely received\r\nsome slight internal injury. But the doctor insisted on the greatest\r\ncare being taken of him, and on absolute rest. So when the invalid\r\nopened his eyes S\xc3\xa9verine, who watched over him as over a child, begged\r\nhim to be good and to obey her in everything. Still very weak, he\r\npromised with a nod.\r\n\r\nHe was in possession of all his faculties. He recognised the room which\r\nshe had described on the night of her confession. He was lying on the\r\nbed. There were the windows through which, without even raising his\r\nhead, he could see the trains flash past, suddenly shaking the whole\r\nhouse. And he felt by the surroundings, that this house was just as he\r\nhad so often seen it, when he went by on his engine. He saw it again\r\nnow in his mind, set down aslant beside the line, in its distress and\r\nabandonment, with its closed shutters. The aspect had become more\r\nlamentable and dubious, since it had been for sale, with the immense\r\nboard adding to the melancholy appearance of the garden overgrown with\r\nbriars. He recalled the frightful sadness he had felt each time he\r\npassed the place, the uneasiness with which it haunted him as if it\r\nstood at this spot to be the calamity of his existence. And now, as he\r\nlay so weak in this room, he seemed to understand it all, there could\r\nbe no other solution to the matter--he was assuredly going to die there.\r\n\r\nAs soon as S\xc3\xa9verine perceived he was in a condition to understand her,\r\nshe hastened to set his mind at ease in regard to a subject which she\r\nfancied might be worrying him, whispering in his ear as she drew up the\r\nbedclothes:\r\n\r\n"You need not be anxious. I emptied your pockets, and took the watch."\r\n\r\nHe gazed at her with wide open eyes, making an effort to remember.\r\n\r\n"The watch! Ah! yes! the watch," he murmured.\r\n\r\n"They might have searched you," she resumed. "And I have hidden it\r\namong my own things. Don\'t be afraid."\r\n\r\nHe thanked her with a pressure of the hand. Turning his head, he caught\r\nsight of the knife lying on the table. This had also been found in one\r\nof his pockets, but there was no need to conceal it, for it was just\r\nlike many another knife.\r\n\r\nThe following day, Jacques already found himself stronger, and began\r\nto hope he would not die there. He experienced real pleasure when he\r\nnoticed the presence of Cabuche, who did all he could to make himself\r\nuseful, and was at great pains to avoid making a noise on the floor\r\nwith his heavy, giant-like tread. The quarryman had not quitted\r\nS\xc3\xa9verine since the accident, and it seemed as if he also was under the\r\ninfluence of an ardent desire to show his devotedness. He abandoned\r\nhis own occupation, and came every morning to assist in the housework,\r\nserving her with canine-like fidelity, and with eyes ever fixed on her\r\nown. As he remarked: she was a splendid woman, in spite of her slim\r\nappearance. One might well do something for her, considering she did\r\nso much for others. And the two sweethearts became so accustomed to\r\nhim that they did not trouble if he happened to surprise them talking\r\naffectionately to one another, or even kissing, when he chanced to pass\r\ndiscreetly through the apartment, making as little as he could of his\r\nburly frame.\r\n\r\nWhat astonished Jacques was the frequent absence of S\xc3\xa9verine from the\r\nroom. On the first day, in obedience to the orders of the doctor,\r\nshe had said nothing about Henri being below, feeling that the idea\r\nof absolute solitude would act as a sort of soothing draught on her\r\npatient.\r\n\r\n"We are alone here, are we not?" he inquired.\r\n\r\n"Yes, my darling, alone, all alone," she answered. "You can sleep in\r\npeace."\r\n\r\nBut she disappeared at every moment, and the next day he overheard\r\nfootsteps and whispering on the ground floor. Then, on the following\r\nday, he distinguished a lot of stifled merriment, bursts of clear\r\nlaughter, two fresh, youthful voices that never ceased.\r\n\r\n"What is it? Who is there?" he asked. "So we are not alone?"\r\n\r\n"Well, no, my darling," she replied. "Down below, just under your room,\r\nis another injured man to whom I have given hospitality."\r\n\r\n"Ah!" he exclaimed. "Who is it?"\r\n\r\n"Henri, you know, the headguard!" said she.\r\n\r\n"Henri! Ah!" he exclaimed again.\r\n\r\n"And this morning," she continued, "his two sisters arrived. It is they\r\nthat you hear; they laugh at everything. As he is much better they are\r\ngoing back again to-night, on account of their father who cannot do\r\nwithout them; and Henri is to remain two or three days longer to get\r\nquite well. Just fancy, he leapt from the train without breaking a\r\nsingle bone; only he was like an idiot; but his reason has returned."\r\n\r\nJacques made no remark, but he fixed such a penetrating look on her,\r\nthat she added:\r\n\r\n"You understand, eh? If he was not there, people might gossip about us\r\ntwo. So long as I am not alone with you, my husband can say nothing and\r\nI have a good pretext for remaining here. You understand?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes," he replied; "that is all right."\r\n\r\nAnd Jacques, until evening, listened to the laughter of the little\r\nDauvergnes, which he recollected having heard in Paris, ascending in\r\nthe same manner from the lower floor into the room where S\xc3\xa9verine had\r\nmade her confession to him. With darkness came silence, and he could\r\nonly distinguish the light footsteps of S\xc3\xa9verine going from him to\r\nthe other wounded man. The door below closed, and the house fell into\r\nprofound silence. Feeling thirsty, he had to knock twice on the floor\r\nwith a chair for her to come up to him. When she arrived, she was all\r\nsmiles and very assiduous, explaining that she could not get away\r\nbefore because it was necessary to keep a compress of cold water on the\r\nhead of Henri.\r\n\r\nOn the fourth day, Jacques was able to get up, and pass a couple of\r\nhours in an armchair before the window. By bending forward a little\r\nhe could see the strip of garden inclosed by a low wall and invaded\r\nby briars with their pale bloom, a slice of which had been taken by\r\nthe railway. And he remembered the night when he stood on tiptoe to\r\nlook over the wall. He again saw the rather large piece of ground\r\nat the back of the house shut in by a hedge only, the hedge he had\r\ngone through to run up against Flore seated at the entrance to the\r\ndilapidated greenhouse, cutting up stolen cord with scissors. Ah! that\r\nabominable night full of the terror of his complaint! That Flore, with\r\nthe tall, supple stature of a fair warrior woman, her flaming eyes\r\nfixed straight on his, was ever present since the recollection of it\r\nall returned to him more and more distinctly.\r\n\r\nAt first he had not opened his lips respecting the accident, and no one\r\nabout him alluded to it, out of prudence. But every detail came back to\r\nhim, and he pieced it all together again. He thought of nothing else,\r\nand his mind was so continuously occupied with the subject, that now,\r\nat the window, his sole occupation consisted in looking for traces of\r\nthe collision, in watching for the actors in the catastrophe. How was\r\nit that he did not see Flore there at her post as gatekeeper with her\r\nflag in her fist? He dared not ask the question, and this increased the\r\nuneasiness he felt in this lugubrious dwelling, which seemed to him to\r\nbe peopled with spectres.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, one morning, when Cabuche was there assisting S\xc3\xa9verine,\r\nhe ended by making up his mind.\r\n\r\n"And where is Flore?" he inquired. "Is she ill?"\r\n\r\nThe quarryman, taken unawares, misunderstood a gesture the young woman\r\nmade, and, thinking she was telling him to speak out, he answered:\r\n\r\n"Poor Flore is dead."\r\n\r\nJacques looked at them shuddering, and it then became necessary to tell\r\nhim all. Together they related to him the suicide of the young girl,\r\nhow she had been cut in two in the tunnel. The burial of the mother had\r\nbeen delayed until the evening, so that her daughter might be carried\r\naway at the same time; and they now slept side by side in the little\r\ncemetery at Doinville, where they had gone to join the first who had\r\nmade the journey, the younger sister, that gentle but unfortunate\r\nLouisette. Three miserable creatures among those who fall on the road,\r\nwho are crushed and disappear, as if swept away by the terrible blast\r\nof those passing trains.\r\n\r\n"Dead! great God!" repeated Jacques very lowly. "My poor Aunt Phasie,\r\nand Flore, and Louisette!"\r\n\r\nAt the last name, Cabuche, who was assisting S\xc3\xa9verine to push the bed,\r\ninstinctively raised his eyes to her, troubled at the recollection of\r\nhis tender feelings for another in presence of the budding passion\r\nwhich he felt had gained him; he, a soft-hearted creature of limited\r\nintelligence, was without defence, like an affectionate dog who is\r\nconquered by the first caress. But S\xc3\xa9verine who knew all about his\r\ntragic love episode remained grave, looking at him with sympathetic\r\neyes, so that he felt very much touched; and his hand having\r\nunintentionally grazed her hand, as he was passing her the pillows, he\r\nfelt like suffocating, and it was in a stammering voice that he replied\r\nto the next question Jacques put to him.\r\n\r\n"Did they accuse her, then, of causing the accident?" asked the latter.\r\n\r\n"Oh! no, no! Only it was her fault, you understand?" answered Cabuche.\r\n\r\nIn disjointed sentences he related all he knew. For his own part, he\r\nhad seen nothing as he was in the house when the horses moved on to\r\ndrag the stone dray across the line. This, indeed, was what caused him\r\nsilent remorse. The judicial gentlemen had harshly reproached him with\r\nleaving his team. The frightful misfortune would not have occurred had\r\nhe remained with them. The inquiry, therefore, resulted in showing that\r\nthere had been simple negligence on the part of Flore; and as she had\r\npunished herself atrociously, nothing further was done. The company did\r\nnot even remove Misard, who, with his air of humility and deference,\r\nhad got out of the scrape by accusing the dead girl: she always did\r\nas she liked; he had to leave his box at every minute to close the\r\ngate. The company, for their part, were compelled to recognise that on\r\nthis particular morning he had performed his duty perfectly. And, in\r\nthe interval that would elapse before he married again, they had just\r\nauthorised him to take as gatekeeper an old woman of the neighbourhood,\r\nnamed Ducloux, formerly a servant at an inn, who lived on money she had\r\neconomised in her younger days.\r\n\r\nWhen Cabuche left the room, Jacques detained S\xc3\xa9verine by a glance. He\r\nlooked extremely pale.\r\n\r\n"You know very well that it was Flore who pulled on the horses, and\r\nbarred the line with the blocks of stone," said he.\r\n\r\nS\xc3\xa9verine in her turn grew pallid.\r\n\r\n"Darling, what on earth are you saying?" she answered. "You are getting\r\nfeverish; you must go to bed again."\r\n\r\n"No, no, I am not wandering. Do you hear? I saw her, as I see you," he\r\ncontinued. "She held the cattle, and with her firm fist, prevented the\r\ndray advancing."\r\n\r\nOn hearing this, S\xc3\xa9verine, losing her legs, sank down on a chair\r\nopposite him.\r\n\r\n"Good heavens! good heavens!" she exclaimed. "It strikes terror into\r\none. It is monstrous. I shall never be able to get any sleep."\r\n\r\n"Of course," he resumed, "the thing is clear. She attempted to kill\r\nus both in the general slaughter. She had been making me advances for\r\na long time, and she was jealous. Coupled with this, she was half off\r\nher head, and had all manner of rum ideas. Only think such a number\r\nof murders at one stroke--quite a multitude plunged in gore! Ah! the\r\nwretch!"\r\n\r\nHis eyes grew wide open, a nervous twitch drew down his lip, and he\r\nheld his tongue. They remained looking at one another for fully a\r\nminute without speaking. Then, tearing himself from the abominable\r\nvision that had risen up between them, he continued in a lower tone:\r\n\r\n"Ah! she is dead! So that is why her ghost is here! Since I recovered\r\nconsciousness she seems to be always present. Again this morning, I\r\nturned round thinking her at the head of my bed. Still she is dead, and\r\nwe are alive. Let us hope she will not avenge herself now!"\r\n\r\nS\xc3\xa9verine shuddered.\r\n\r\n"Hold your tongue, hold your tongue!" said she. "You will drive me\r\ncrazy."\r\n\r\nShe left the room, and he heard her go downstairs to the other invalid.\r\n\r\nJacques, who had remained at the window, was again lost in the\r\ncontemplation of the line, of the small habitation of the gatekeeper,\r\nwith its great well, of the signal-box, that wooden hut where Misard\r\nseemed to be dozing over his regular, monotonous work. Jacques became\r\nabsorbed by these things now for hours, as if poring over some problem\r\nhe could not solve, and the solution of which, nevertheless, concerned\r\nhis safety.\r\n\r\nHe never felt tired of watching Misard, that puny creature, gentle\r\nand pallid, everlastingly disturbed by a nasty little cough, who had\r\npoisoned his wife, who had got the better of that strapping woman, like\r\na rodent insect obstinately pursuing its passion. He could certainly\r\nnot have had any other idea in his head for years, day and night,\r\nduring the twelve interminable hours he remained on duty. At each\r\nelectric tinkle, announcing a train, he blew the horn; then, when the\r\ntrain had passed and he had blocked the line, he pressed an electric\r\nknob to warn the next signalman of its arrival, afterwards touching a\r\nsecond knob to open the line at the preceding signal-box. These simple\r\nmechanical movements had, in the end, entered into his vegetative life,\r\nas bodily habits.\r\n\r\nUntutored and obtuse he never read anything, but between the calls\r\nof his apparatus remained with his arms hanging down beside him, and\r\nhis eyes gazing vaguely into space. Being almost always seated in\r\nhis box, he had no other diversion than that of dawdling as long\r\nas possible over his lunch. When this was finished he fell into his\r\ndoltishness again with a skull quite empty, without a thought; and he\r\nwas particularly tormented with terrible drowsiness, sometimes sleeping\r\nwith his eyes open. At night-time, if he wished to avoid giving way to\r\nthis irresistible torpor, he had to get up and walk with unsteady legs\r\nlike a drunken man. And it was thus that the struggle with his wife,\r\nthat secret combat as to who should have the concealed 1,000 frcs.\r\nafter the death of the other, must for months and months have been the\r\nsole reflection in the benumbed brain of this solitary being.\r\n\r\nWhen he blew his horn; when he man\xc5\x93uvred his signals, watching in\r\nautomatic fashion over the safety of so many lives, he thought of the\r\npoison; and when he waited with idle arms, his eyes moving from side to\r\nside with sleep, he still thought of it. Of nothing did he think but\r\nthat: he would kill her, he would search, it was he who would have the\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nAt present, Jacques was astonished to find Misard had not changed. It\r\nwas possible then to kill without any trouble, and life continue as\r\nbefore. After the feverishness, attending the first rummages for the\r\nmoney-bag, he had just resumed his usual indifference, the cunning,\r\ngentle manner of a feeble being who shunned a shock. As a matter of\r\nfact, he might well have put an end to his wife, but she triumphed\r\nnotwithstanding; for he was beaten. He had turned the house upside down\r\nwithout discovering anything, not a centime; and his looks alone, those\r\nanxious ferreting looks, revealed on his sallow countenance how busy\r\nwas his mind.\r\n\r\nEverlastingly he saw the wide open eyes of the dead woman, the hideous\r\nsmile on her lips which seemed to repeat: "Search! search!" He sought.\r\nHe could not give his brain one minute of rest now. It worked, worked\r\nincessantly in quest of the spot where the treasure was buried,\r\nthinking over the possible hiding-places, rejecting those where he\r\nhad already rummaged, bursting into feverish excitement as soon as\r\nhe imagined a new one; and then, burning with such haste, that he\r\nabandoned everything to run off there to no purpose. This, in the end,\r\nbecame an intolerable torment, an avenging torture, a sort of cerebral\r\ninsomnia which kept him awake, stupid and reflecting in spite of\r\nhimself, in the tic-tac of the pendulum of his fixed idea.\r\n\r\nWhen he blew his horn, once for the down-trains, twice for the up\r\ntrains, he sought; when he answered the ringing, when he pressed the\r\nknobs of his apparatus, closing, opening the line, he sought. He\r\nsought, sought, bewilderingly, ceaselessly. In the daytime, during the\r\nlong period of waiting, heavy with idleness; at night, tormented with\r\nsleep as if exiled to the other end of the world, in the silence of the\r\ngreat black country. And the woman Ducloux, who at present looked after\r\nthe gate, actuated by the desire to become his wife, showed him every\r\npossible attention, and was alarmed to see that he never closed his\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nOne night, Jacques, who began to take a few steps in his room, had got\r\nup and approaching the window, saw a lantern moving to and fro at the\r\nhouse of Misard: assuredly the man was searching. But the following\r\nnight, the convalescent being again on the look out, was astounded to\r\nrecognise a great dark form, which proved none other than Cabuche,\r\nwho was standing in the road beneath the window of the adjoining\r\nroom where S\xc3\xa9verine slept. And this sight, without him being able to\r\nunderstand why it should be so, instead of irritating him, filled him\r\nwith commiseration and sadness: another unfortunate fellow, this great\r\nbrute, planted there like a bewildered faithful animal.\r\n\r\nIn truth, S\xc3\xa9verine, who was so slim and not handsome, when examined\r\nin detail, must possess a very powerful charm with her raven hair and\r\ndeep blue eyes for even savages, giants of limited intelligence, to\r\nbe so smitten with her as to pass the night at her door, like little\r\ntrembling youths! He recalled certain things that he had noticed: the\r\neagerness of the quarryman to assist her, and the look of servility\r\nwith which he offered his help. Yes, Cabuche was certainly in love with\r\nher. And Jacques, having kept his eye on him, the next day noticed\r\nhim furtively pick up a hair-pin that had fallen from her hair as she\r\nmade the bed, and keep it in his closed hand so as not to restore it.\r\nJacques thought of his own torment, of all he had suffered through his\r\nlove, of all the trouble and fright returning with health.\r\n\r\nTwo more days passed. The week was coming to an end, and the injured\r\nmen, as the doctor had foreseen, would be able to resume duty. One\r\nmorning, the driver being at the window, saw a brand new engine pass\r\nwith his fireman Pecqueux, who greeted him with his hand as if calling\r\nhim. But he was in no hurry, an awakening of passion detained him\r\nthere, a sort of anxious expectation as to what would happen next.\r\n\r\nThat same day, in the lower part of the house, he again heard fresh\r\nyouthful laughter, a gaiety of grown up girls, filling the sad\r\nhabitation with all the racket of a ladies\' school in the playground.\r\nHe recognised the voices of the little Dauvergnes, but he did not say\r\na word on the subject to S\xc3\xa9verine who absented herself nearly the\r\nentire day, unable to remain with him for five minutes at a time. In\r\nthe evening, the house having fallen into deathlike silence, and as\r\nS\xc3\xa9verine, looking grave and slightly pale, loitered in his room, he\r\nlooked at her fixedly, and remarked inquiringly:\r\n\r\n"So he has gone? His sisters have taken him away?"\r\n\r\nShe briefly answered:\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"And we are at last alone, quite alone?" he continued.\r\n\r\n"Yes, quite alone," said she. "To-morrow we shall have to quit one\r\nanother. I shall return to Havre. We have been camping long enough in\r\nthis desert."\r\n\r\nHe continued looking at her in a smiling but constrained manner, and at\r\nlength made up his mind to speak.\r\n\r\n"You are sorry he has gone, eh?" he inquired.\r\n\r\nAnd as she started and wished to protest, he interrupted her:\r\n\r\n"I am not seeking a quarrel with you," he said. "You know well enough\r\nthat I am not jealous. One day you told me to kill you if you were\r\nunfaithful to me, did you not? I do not look like a man who is going\r\nto kill his sweetheart. But really you were always below, it was\r\nimpossible to have you to myself for a minute. It recalled to my mind\r\na remark your husband one day made, that you would be as likely as\r\nnot to listen to that young fellow without taking any pleasure in the\r\nexperiment, simply to begin something new."\r\n\r\nShe ceased defending herself, and slowly repeated, twice over:\r\n\r\n"To begin something new, to begin something new."\r\n\r\nThen, in an outburst of irresistible frankness, she continued:\r\n\r\n"Well, listen, what you say is true. We two can tell one another\r\neverything. We are bound closely enough together. This man has pursued\r\nme for months. And, when I found him below, he spoke to me again. He\r\nrepeated that he loved me to distraction, and in a manner so thoroughly\r\nimbued with gratitude for the care I had taken of him, with such gentle\r\ntenderness, that, it is true, I for a moment dreamed of loving him\r\nalso, of beginning something new, something better, something very\r\nsweet. Yes, something without pleasure perhaps, but which would have\r\ngiven me calm----"\r\n\r\nShe paused, and hesitated, before continuing:\r\n\r\n"For the road in front of us two," she resumed, "is now barred. We\r\nshall advance no further. Our dream of leaving France, the hope of\r\nwealth and happiness over there in America, all the felicity that\r\ndepended on you, is impossible, because you were unable to do the\r\nthing. Oh! I am not making you any reproach! It is better that it\r\nwas not done; but I want to make you understand that with you I have\r\nnothing to hope for; to-morrow will be like yesterday, the same\r\nannoyances, the same torments."\r\n\r\nHe allowed her to speak, and only questioned her when he saw her silent.\r\n\r\n"So that is why you gave way to the other?" he suggested.\r\n\r\nShe had taken a few steps in the room, and returning, she shrugged her\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\n"No, I did not give way to him," said she. "I tell you so, simply;\r\nand I am sure you believe me, because henceforth there is no reason\r\nwhy we should lie to one another. He kissed my hand, but he did not\r\nkiss my lips, and that I swear. He expects to meet me at Paris later\r\non because, seeing him so miserable, I did not wish to drive him to\r\ndespair."\r\n\r\nShe was right. Jacques believed her. He saw she was not telling\r\nuntruths. And his old feeling of anguish began again, in the rekindling\r\nflame of their passion, that frightful trouble of the growing mania, at\r\nthe thought that he was now shut up alone with her, far from the world.\r\nWishing to escape, he exclaimed:\r\n\r\n"But then, the other one! For there is another one! This Cabuche!"\r\n\r\nAbruptly turning round, she went back to him, and said:\r\n\r\n"Ah! So you noticed him! So you know that, too! Yes, it is a fact.\r\nThere is also this one. I cannot imagine what has come to them\r\nall. Cabuche has never said a word to me. But I can see he is\r\nbeside himself, when he observes us kissing; and when I address you\r\naffectionately, he goes off to whimper in out-of-the-way corners. And\r\nthen he robs me of all sorts of things, my own private belongings.\r\nGloves and even pocket-handkerchiefs disappear, and he carries them\r\nover there to his cavern as if they were treasures. Only you need not\r\nimagine that I am likely to fall in love with this savage. He is too\r\ncoarse, he would frighten me to death. Moreover, his love is passive.\r\nNo, no, when those great brutes are timid, they die of love, without\r\nseeking to gratify their passion. You might leave me a month in his\r\nkeeping, and he would not touch me with the tips of his fingers, no\r\nmore than he touched Louisette, I can answer for that now."\r\n\r\nAt this remembrance, they looked at one another, and silence\r\nensued. Past events came to their minds: their meeting before the\r\nexamining-magistrate at Rouen; then their first trip to Paris, so full\r\nof charm; and their love-making at Havre, and all that followed, good\r\nand terrible. She drew nearer to him, coming so close that he felt the\r\nwarmth of her breath.\r\n\r\n"No, no," she resumed; "still less with that one than with the other.\r\nWith nobody in fact do you understand. And do you want to know why? Ah!\r\nI feel it at this hour! I am sure I make no mistake: it is because you\r\nhave taken entire possession of me; there is no other word. Yes, taken,\r\nas one takes an object with both hands and walks off with it. Before I\r\nknew you I belonged to no one. I am now yours and shall remain yours,\r\neven against your own wish, even if I do not desire to do so myself. I\r\ncannot explain this to you; it was to that end that we met. Ah! it is\r\nyou alone that I love! I can love no one but you!"\r\n\r\nShe put forward her arms to have him to herself, to rest her head on\r\nhis shoulder, her mouth on his lips. But he grasped her hands, he held\r\nher back aghast, terrified at the sensation of the old shiver ascending\r\nhis limbs, with the blood beating on his brain. Then came the buzzing\r\nin the ears, the strokes of a hammer, the clamour of a multitude, as\r\nin his former severe attacks. For some time past he had been almost\r\nunable to kiss her in broad daylight or even by the flame of a candle,\r\nin terror lest he should go mad if he saw her. And a lamp stood there\r\nlighting them both up brilliantly. If he trembled as he did, if he\r\nfelt himself going crazy, it must be because he perceived the white\r\nrotundity of her bosom through her open dressing-gown.\r\n\r\n"Our existence may well be barred," she continued. "Let it be! Although\r\nI can hope for nothing more from you; although I know that to-morrow\r\nwill bring us the same worries and the same torments, I do not care; I\r\nhave nothing to do but to let my life drag along and suffer with you.\r\nWe shall return to Havre, and things may go on as they will, so long as\r\nI have an hour in your company from time to time."\r\n\r\nJacques, in the fury of madness, excited by her caresses, and having\r\nno weapon, had already stretched out both his hands to strangle her,\r\nwhen she, turning round, extinguished the lamp of her own accord. Then,\r\nseating herself, she said:\r\n\r\n"Oh! my darling, if you could only have done it, how happy we should\r\nhave been over there! No, no, I am not asking you to do what you cannot\r\ndo; only I\'m so sorry our dream has not been realised. I was afraid\r\njust now; I do not know how it is, but it seems as if something menaces\r\nme. It is no doubt childishness, but at every moment I turn round as\r\nthough something was there ready to strike me; and I have only you, my\r\ndarling, to defend me. All my joy depends on you. It is for you alone\r\nthat I live."\r\n\r\nWithout answering he strained her to him, putting into this pressure\r\nwhat he did not say: his emotion, his sincere desire to be good to her,\r\nthe violent love she had never ceased to inspire in him. And yet he had\r\nagain wanted to kill her that very night; for if she had not turned\r\nround and extinguished the lamp he would have strangled her. That was\r\ncertain; never would he be cured. The attacks came back by the hazard\r\nof circumstances without him even being able to discover or discuss the\r\ncauses. Thus, why did he wish to kill her on that night, when he found\r\nher faithful, and imbued with a more expansive and confiding passion?\r\nWas it because the more she loved him, the more he wished to make her\r\nhis, even to destroying her in the terrifying gloom of male egotism?\r\nDid he want to have possession of her dead as the earth?\r\n\r\n"Tell me, my darling," she murmured, "why am I afraid? Do you know of\r\nanything threatening me?"\r\n\r\n"No, no," answered Jacques; "rest assured that there is nothing\r\nthreatening you."\r\n\r\n"But at moments," said she, "all my body is in a tremble. Behind me\r\nlurks a constant danger which I do not see, but which I feel very\r\ndistinctly. How is it that I am afraid?"\r\n\r\n"No, no," he repeated, "there is no cause for alarm. I love you, and\r\nwill allow no one to do you any harm. See how nice it is to be as we\r\nare, one in body and soul!"\r\n\r\nA delicious silence followed, which was broken by S\xc3\xa9verine.\r\n\r\n"Ah! my darling," she resumed, in her low, caressing whisper, "if we\r\ncould only always be as we are now. You know we would sell this house,\r\nand set out with the money to join your friend in America, who is\r\nstill expecting you. I never pass a day without making plans for our\r\nlife over there. But you cannot do it I know. If I speak to you on the\r\nsubject, it is not to annoy you, it is because it comes from my heart\r\nin spite of myself."\r\n\r\nJacques abruptly took the same decision he had so often taken before:\r\nto kill Roubaud in order that he might not kill her. On this occasion,\r\nas previously, he fancied he possessed the absolutely firm will to do\r\nso.\r\n\r\n"I could not before," he murmured in response, "but I might be able to\r\nnow. Did I not make you a promise that I would?"\r\n\r\nShe feebly remonstrated.\r\n\r\n"No; do not promise, I implore you," said she. "It makes us sick\r\nafterwards, when you have lost courage. And then it is horrible. It\r\nmust not be done. No, no! It must not be done."\r\n\r\n"Yes," answered Jacques, "it must, on the contrary as you know. It is\r\nbecause it is necessary that I shall find strength to do it, I wanted\r\nto speak to you on the subject, and we will talk about it now, as we\r\nare here alone, and so quiet that one could hear a pin drop."\r\n\r\nShe had already become resigned, and she was sighing, her heart\r\nswelling, beating with violent throbs.\r\n\r\n"Oh dear! oh dear!" she murmured. "So long as the thing was not to be,\r\nI wanted it done. But now that it becomes serious I shall not be able\r\nto exist."\r\n\r\nThis weighty resolution caused another silence. Around them they felt\r\nthe desert, the desolation of the savage district. Suddenly she resumed\r\nher low murmur:\r\n\r\n"We must have him here. Yes, I could send for him on some pretext;\r\nwhich, I do not know. We can settle that later on. Then you will be\r\nwaiting for him in concealment, do you see? And the thing will go on by\r\nitself, for we are sure not to be disturbed here. That is what we must\r\ndo, eh?"\r\n\r\nWith docility he answered:\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes."\r\n\r\nBut she, lost in reflection, weighed every detail; and little by\r\nlittle, as the plan developed in her head, she discussed and improved\r\nit.\r\n\r\n"Only, my darling," she went on, "it would be foolish not to take\r\nour precautions. If we are to be arrested on the morrow, I prefer\r\nto remain as we are. Look here, I have read this somewhere, I have\r\nforgotten where, in a novel for sure: the best thing would be to make\r\nbelieve that he committed suicide. For some time back he has been very\r\npeculiar, not quite right in his head, and so gloomy that no one would\r\nbe surprised to suddenly learn that he came here and killed himself.\r\nBut then, we must arrange matters in such a way that the idea of\r\nsuicide will seem probable. Is it not so?"\r\n\r\n"Without a doubt," he replied.\r\n\r\nAfter a pause, S\xc3\xa9verine, who had been thinking, resumed:\r\n\r\n"Eh! Something to hide the trace. I say, here is an idea that has just\r\nstruck me! Supposing he got that knife in his throat, we should only\r\nhave to carry him together over there and lay him across the line. Do\r\nyou understand? We could place him with his neck on a rail, so that he\r\nwould be decapitated by the first train that passed. After that they\r\ncould make their investigations. With his head and neck crushed, there\r\nwould no longer be a hole, nothing! Do you agree? Answer!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I agree," said he; "it is capital."\r\n\r\nBoth became animated. She was almost gay, and quite proud of her\r\nfaculty of imagination.\r\n\r\n"But, my darling," she continued, "I have just been thinking, there\r\nis something more. If you remain here with me, the suggestion of\r\nsuicide will certainly be viewed with suspicion. You must go away. Do\r\nyou understand? You will leave to-morrow, openly, in the presence of\r\nCabuche and Misard, so that the fact of your departure may be well\r\nestablished. You will take the train at Barentin, and leave it at\r\nRouen, on some pretence or other; then, as soon as it is dark, you will\r\nreturn, and I will let you in the back way. It is only four leagues,\r\nand you can be here in less than three hours. This time everything is\r\nsettled, and, if you like, it is agreed."\r\n\r\n"Yes," he answered; "I am willing, and it is agreed."\r\n\r\nIt was now he who reflected, and there came a long silence. All at\r\nonce, she broke out:\r\n\r\n"Yes; but what about the pretext for bringing him here? In any case,\r\nhe could only take the eight o\'clock at night train, after coming off\r\nduty, and would not get here before ten o\'clock, which is all the\r\nbetter. Hi! that person who wishes to see the house, with a view to\r\npurchasing it, of whom Misard spoke to me, and who is coming the day\r\nafter to-morrow morning! That will do. I will send my husband a wire\r\nthe first thing, to say his presence is absolutely necessary. He will\r\nbe here to-morrow night. You will leave in the afternoon, and will be\r\nable to get back before he arrives. It will be dark, no moon, nothing\r\nto interfere with us. Everything dovetails in perfectly."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said he approvingly, "perfectly."\r\n\r\nWhen they at last went to sleep, it was not daylight, but a streak of\r\ndawn began to whiten the gloom that had hidden them from one another,\r\nas if both had been wrapped in a black mantle. He slept like a top\r\nuntil ten o\'clock, without a dream; and, when he opened his eyes, he\r\nwas alone. S\xc3\xa9verine was dressing in her own apartment, on the other\r\nside of the landing. A sheet of clear sun entered through the window\r\nof the room occupied by Jacques, showing up the red curtains of the\r\nbedstead, the red paper on the walls, all that red with which the\r\nplace was flaming; while the house tottered in the thunder of a train\r\nthat had just sped past. It must have been this train that awakened\r\nhim. Bedazzled by the glare of light, he looked at the sun, at the\r\nstreaming crimson surroundings amidst which he found himself; then he\r\nrecollected: the matter was settled, it was the next night that he\r\nwould kill, when this great sun had disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe day passed as had been arranged by S\xc3\xa9verine and Jacques. Before\r\nbreakfast, she requested Misard to take the telegram for her husband to\r\nDoinville; and at about three o\'clock, as Cabuche was there, Jacques\r\nopenly made his preparations for departure. As he was leaving to catch\r\nthe 4.15 train from Barentin, Cabuche, having nothing to do, feeling\r\nhimself drawn to the other by his secret passion, happy to find in\r\nthe sweetheart something in common with the woman he was in love with\r\nhimself, accompanied the driver to the station. Jacques reached Rouen\r\nat 4.40, and, getting down, found accommodation at a small inn near\r\nthe railway kept by a woman from the same neighbourhood as himself. He\r\nspoke of looking up his comrades on the morrow, before proceeding to\r\nParis to resume duty. But he said he felt very tired, having presumed\r\ntoo much on his strength; and, at six o\'clock, he went off to bed, in\r\na room he had taken on the ground floor, which had a window opening\r\non a deserted alley. Ten minutes later, he was on the road to La\r\nCroix-de-Maufras, having got out of this window without being seen, and\r\ntaken good care to close the shutters, so as to be able to secretly\r\nreturn the same way.\r\n\r\nIt was not until a quarter after nine that Jacques found himself before\r\nthe solitary house standing aslant beside the line, in the distress\r\nof its abandonment. The night was very dark, not a glimmer could be\r\ndistinguished on the hermetically closed front. And Jacques again felt\r\nthat painful blow in his heart, that feeling of frightful sadness which\r\nseemed like the presentiment of the evil that awaited him there.\r\n\r\nAs had been arranged with S\xc3\xa9verine, he threw three small pebbles\r\nagainst a shutter of the red room; then he went to the back of the\r\nhouse where a door at last silently opened. Having closed it behind\r\nhim, he followed the light footsteps that went feeling their way up the\r\nstaircase. But when he reached the bedroom, and by the light of a large\r\nlamp burning on the corner of a table perceived the bed in disorder,\r\nthe clothes of the young woman thrown on a chair, and herself in a\r\ndressing-gown, with her volume of hair arranged for the night, coiled\r\non the top of her head, leaving her neck bare, he stood motionless with\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\n"What!" he exclaimed; "you had gone to bed?"\r\n\r\n"Of course," she answered, "that is much better. An idea struck me. You\r\nsee, when he arrives and I go down, as I am to open the door to him, he\r\nwill have still less cause to be distrustful. I shall tell him I have\r\na headache. Misard already knows I am not well. And this will permit\r\nme to affirm that I never left this room when they find him to-morrow,\r\ndown there, on the line."\r\n\r\nBut Jacques shuddered, and lost his temper.\r\n\r\n"No, no," said he, "dress yourself. You must be up. You cannot remain\r\nas you are."\r\n\r\nShe was astonished, and began to laugh.\r\n\r\n"But why, my darling?" she inquired. "Do not be anxious, I can assure\r\nyou I do not feel at all cold. Just see how warm I am!"\r\n\r\nShe advanced towards him in a caressing manner, to take him by the\r\nshoulders, and in raising her arms displayed her bosom through the\r\ndressing-gown she had neglected to fasten, and the night-dress that had\r\ncome undone. But as he drew back, in increasing irritation, she became\r\ndocile.\r\n\r\n"Do not be angry," said she, "I will get between the sheets again, and\r\nthen you will have no reason to be afraid that I shall catch cold."\r\n\r\nWhen she was in bed, with the clothes up to her chin, he seemed more\r\ncalm. And she continued talking quietly, explaining how she had\r\narranged everything in her head.\r\n\r\n"As soon as he knocks," she said, "I shall go down and open the door.\r\nFirst of all, I had the idea of letting him come up here, where you\r\nwould be in waiting for him. But to get his body below again, would\r\nhave caused complications; and, besides, this room has a parquetry\r\nfloor, whereas the vestibule is tiled, and I shall easily be able\r\nto wash it if there should be any spots. Just before you came, as\r\nI was undressing, I thought of a novel I had read, in which the\r\nauthor relates that one man to kill another stripped himself. Do you\r\nunderstand? A wash afterwards, and the clothes are free from any spots.\r\nWhat do you say? Supposing we were to do the same?"\r\n\r\nHe looked at her in bewilderment. But she had her gentle face, her\r\nclear eyes of a little girl, and was simply thinking of arranging the\r\nplan perfectly, in order to ensure success. All this passed through his\r\nhead. But her suggestion, the idea of being bespattered with the blood\r\nof the murder, brought on his abominable shiver which shook him to the\r\nbones.\r\n\r\n"No, no!" he answered. "Do you wish us to act like savages? Why not\r\ndevour his heart as well? How you must hate him!"\r\n\r\nHer face suddenly became clouded. This remark took her from her\r\nthoughts of prudent preparation, to reveal to her the horror of the\r\ndeed. Her eyes filled with tears, and she said:\r\n\r\n"I have suffered too much for the last few months, to have much\r\naffection for him. I have repeated a hundred times over: anything\r\nrather than remain another week with this man. But you are right. It is\r\nfrightful to come to that, we really must want to be happy together.\r\nAnyhow, we will go down without a light. You will stand behind the\r\ndoor, and when I have opened, and he has come in, you will do what you\r\nlike. If I interfere, it is only to help you; it is so that you may not\r\nhave all the trouble yourself. I am arranging the thing as well as I\r\ncan."\r\n\r\nHe went to the table where he saw the knife, the weapon that had\r\nalready been used by the husband, and which she had evidently placed\r\nthere, so that he might strike him in his turn with it. The wide open\r\nblade shone beneath the lamp. Jacques took it up and examined it. She\r\nwatched him, but said nothing. As he held the weapon in his hand there\r\nwas no need to speak to him about it. And she only opened her lips when\r\nhe had laid it down again on the table.\r\n\r\n"Listen, my darling," she continued, "I am not urging you on to it, am\r\nI? There is still time. Go away, if you do not feel you can do it."\r\n\r\nBut he became obstinate, and with a violent gesture exclaimed:\r\n\r\n"Do you take me for a coward? This time it is settled. I have sworn."\r\n\r\nAt that moment, the house was set rocking by the thunder of a train,\r\nwhich passed like a thunderbolt, and so close to the room that it\r\nseemed to go through it in its roar, and Jacques added:\r\n\r\n"There is his train. The through train to Paris. He got down at\r\nBarentin, and will be here in half an hour."\r\n\r\nNeither Jacques nor S\xc3\xa9verine made any further remark for some time.\r\nIn their minds they saw this man advancing through the night along\r\nthe narrow paths. Jacques had begun to walk up and down the room, as\r\nif counting the steps of the other whom each stride brought a little\r\nnearer. Another, another; and, at the last one, he would be in ambush\r\nbehind the vestibule door, and would drive the knife into his neck the\r\nmoment he entered. S\xc3\xa9verine, still with the bedclothes up to her chin,\r\nlying on her back, with her great eyes motionless, watched him going\r\nand coming, her mind lulled by the cadence of his walk, which reached\r\nher like the echo of distant footsteps over there. They came without\r\npause, one after the other, and nothing would now stop them. When the\r\nsufficient number had been taken, she would spring out of bed, and go\r\ndown to open the door, with bare feet and without a light. "Is it you,\r\nmy dear? Come in, I went to bed!" she would say. And he would not even\r\nanswer. He would sink down in the obscurity with his throat gashed open.\r\n\r\nAgain a train went by. One on the down-line this time, the slow train\r\nwhich passed La Croix-de-Maufras five minutes after the other. Jacques\r\nstopped in his walk, surprised. Only five minutes had expired! How long\r\nthe half hour would be! He experienced the necessity of keeping on the\r\nmove, and resumed striding from one end of the room to the other. He\r\nbegan to feel anxious, and was already communing with himself: would he\r\nbe able to do it? He was familiar with the progress of the phenomenon\r\nwithin him, from having followed it on more than ten different\r\noccasions; first of all a certainty, an absolute resolution to kill;\r\nthen a weight in the hollow of the chest, a chill in feet and hands;\r\nand all at once the loss of vigour, the impotence of the will to act\r\nupon the muscles which had become inert.\r\n\r\nIn order to gain energy by reasoning, he repeated what he had said\r\nto himself so often: it was his interest to suppress this man--the\r\nfortune awaiting him in America, the possession of the woman he loved.\r\nThe worst of it was, that on finding the latter so scantily clothed a\r\nfew moments before, he verily believed the enterprise would again come\r\nto naught; for, as soon as the old shiver returned, he ceased to have\r\ncommand over himself. For an instant he had trembled in presence of the\r\ntemptation which became too great: she offering herself, and the open\r\nknife lying there. But now he felt strong, girded for the effort. He\r\ncould do it. And he continued waiting for the man, striding up and down\r\nthe apartment from door to window, passing at each turn beside the bed\r\nwhich he would not look at.\r\n\r\nS\xc3\xa9verine continued to lie still in that bed. With her head motionless\r\non the pillow, she now watched him come and go in a seesaw motion of\r\nthe eyes. She also felt anxious, agitated with the fear that this night\r\nhis courage again would fail him. Polish off this business and begin\r\nanew, that was all she wanted. She was entirely for the one who held\r\nher, and heartless for the other whom she had never cared for. They\r\nwere getting rid of him because he was in the way. Nothing could be\r\nmore natural; and she had to reflect, to be touched by the abomination\r\nof the crime. As soon as the vision of blood and the horrible\r\ncomplications disappeared, she resumed her smiling serenity with her\r\ninnocent, tender, and docile face.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, she, who thought she knew Jacques, was astonished at\r\nwhat she observed. He had his round head of a handsome young man, his\r\ncurly hair, his coal black moustache, his brown eyes sparkling with\r\ngold; but his lower jaw advanced so prominently, with a sort of biting\r\nexpression, that it disfigured him. He had just now looked at her as\r\nhe passed, as if in spite of himself; and the brilliancy of his eyes\r\nbecame deadened with a ruddy cloud, while at the same time he started\r\nbackward in a recoil of all his frame.\r\n\r\nWhy did he avoid her? Could it be because he was losing his\r\ncourage, once more? Latterly, ignorant of the constant danger of\r\ndeath threatening her while in his company, she had attributed her\r\ninstinctive fright, for which there was no apparent cause, to the\r\npresentiment of an approaching rupture. The conviction abruptly took\r\nfirm hold of her, that if presently he found himself unable to strike,\r\nhe would flee never to return. After that she made up her mind that he\r\nwould kill, and that she would know how to give him strength, should he\r\nneed it.\r\n\r\nAt this moment another train passed: an interminably long goods train,\r\nwhose extensive string of trucks seemed to be rolling on for ever in\r\nthe oppressive silence that reigned in the apartment. And, leaning on\r\nher elbow, she waited until this tempestuous disturbance became lost in\r\nthe depth of the slumbering country.\r\n\r\n"Another quarter of an hour," said Jacques, aloud. "He has passed\r\nB\xc3\xa9court Wood and is half-way. Ah! how long it is to wait!"\r\n\r\nBut, as he returned towards the window, he found S\xc3\xa9verine standing in\r\nfront of the bed.\r\n\r\n"Suppose we go down with the lamp?" she suggested. "You can see the\r\nspot where you will place yourself. I will show you how I shall open\r\nthe door, and the movement you will have to make."\r\n\r\nHe drew back, trembling.\r\n\r\n"No, no!" he exclaimed. "No lamp!"\r\n\r\n"But just listen," she continued, "we will hide it afterwards. You see\r\nwe must form an idea of the position."\r\n\r\n"No, no!" he repeated. "Get into bed again."\r\n\r\nInstead of obeying, she advanced towards him with the invincible,\r\ndespotic smile of the woman who knows herself to be all powerful.\r\nWhen she held him in her arms, he would give way, he would do as she\r\ndesired; and she continued talking in a caressing voice to conquer him.\r\n\r\n"Come, my darling," she said, "what is the matter with you? One would\r\nthink you were afraid of me. As soon as I approach you seem to avoid\r\nme. But if you only knew how much I need to lean on you at this time,\r\nto feel you there, that we are absolutely of the same mind for ever and\r\never. Do you understand?"\r\n\r\nShe at last made him retreat with his back to the table, and he\r\ncould not flee further. He looked at her in the bright light of the\r\nlamp. Never had he seen her as she was then, with the front of her\r\nnight-dress in disorder, and her hair coiled up so high that her neck\r\nwas quite bare. He was choking, struggling, already in a fury, quite\r\ngiddy with the flood of blood that rushed to his head, at the same\r\nmoment as the abominable shiver fell upon him. And he remembered that\r\nthe knife was there behind him, on the table. He instinctively felt it\r\nthere, he had only to stretch out his hand.\r\n\r\nBy an effort he still managed to stammer:\r\n\r\n"Go back to bed, I implore you."\r\n\r\nBut she continued to approach until she came close to him.\r\n\r\n"Kiss me," she exclaimed, "kiss me with all the love you feel for me!\r\nThat will give us courage. Ah! yes, courage, we are in need of it! We\r\nmust love in a different way to others, stronger than others to do what\r\nwe are about to do. Kiss me with all your heart, with all your soul!"\r\n\r\nHe no longer breathed. He felt as if he was being strangled. The\r\nclamour of a multitude in his brain prevented him from hearing; while\r\nbiting fire behind the ears burnt holes in his head, gained his arms,\r\nhis legs, drove him from his own body, in the frantic rush of that\r\nother one--the invading brute. His hands were about to escape from his\r\ncontrol in the frenzy excited by this feminine semi-nudity. The bare\r\nbosom pressing against his clothes, the neck so white, so delicate,\r\nextended in irresistible temptation, at last plunged him into a state\r\nof furious giddiness, over-powering, tearing away, annihilating his\r\nwill.\r\n\r\n"Kiss me, my darling," she repeated, "while we have still a minute\r\nleft. He will be here, you know. He might knock from one moment to\r\nanother, now, if he has walked quick. As you will not go downstairs to\r\narrange matters beforehand, do not fail to bear this in mind: I shall\r\nlet him in. You will be behind the door; and do not wait, do it at\r\nonce! Oh! at once, to get it over! I love you so fondly, we shall be so\r\nhappy! He is nothing but a wicked man, who makes me suffer, and who is\r\nthe sole obstacle to our happiness. Kiss me, oh! so hard, so hard! Kiss\r\nme as if you were going to devour me, so that nothing may remain of me\r\nbeyond yourself!"\r\n\r\nJacques, feeling behind him with his right hand, had secured the\r\nknife without turning round. And for a moment he remained in the same\r\nposition tightening his grasp on the weapon. Could the feeling that had\r\ncome over him be a return of that thirst to avenge those very ancient\r\noffences, the exact recollection of which escaped him, that rancour\r\namassed from male to male since the first deception in the depths of\r\nthe caverns? He fixed his wild eyes on S\xc3\xa9verine. He now only required\r\nto lay her dead on her back, like a prey torn from others. The gate of\r\nterror opened on the dark sexual chasm. Love, even unto death. Destroy,\r\nto have more absolute possession.\r\n\r\n"Kiss me, kiss me!" she pleaded.\r\n\r\nShe presented her submissive face in imploring tenderness, displaying\r\nher bare neck at the part where it voluptuously met the bosom. And he,\r\nseeing her white skin as in a burst of flame, raised his fist armed\r\nwith the knife. But she perceived the flash of the blade and started\r\nback, gaping in surprise and terror.\r\n\r\n"Jacques, Jacques!" she cried; "me? Good God! Why?"\r\n\r\nWith set teeth and answering not a word, he pursued her. A brief\r\nstruggle brought her again beside the bed. She shrank from him,\r\nhaggard, without defence, her night-dress in shreds.\r\n\r\n"Why? good God! Why?" she continued asking.\r\n\r\nHis fist came down, and the knife stuck the inquiry in her throat.\r\nIn striking, he twisted the blade round in a frightful compulsion of\r\nthe hand which satisfied itself. It was the same blow as President\r\nGrandmorin had received, inflicted at the same place, and with the same\r\nfury. Did she shriek? He never knew. The Paris express flew by at this\r\nmoment with such violence and rapidity that it shook the floor; and\r\nS\xc3\xa9verine was dead, as if struck down in this tempestuous blast.\r\n\r\nJacques, standing motionless, now looked at her, stretched at his feet\r\nbefore the bed. The riot of the train was dying away in the distance\r\nas he gazed upon her in the oppressive silence of the red bedroom.\r\nOn the ground, amidst those red hangings, those red curtains, she\r\nbled profusely. A crimson stream trickled down between her breasts,\r\nspreading over the abdomen to one of the lower limbs, whence it fell\r\nin great drops upon the floor. Her night-dress, rent half asunder, was\r\ndrenched with it. He could never have believed she had so much blood.\r\n\r\nBut what retained him there, haunted, was the abominable look of terror\r\nthat the face of this pretty, gentle, docile woman took in death. The\r\nblack hair stood on end as a helmet of horror, dark as night. The blue\r\neyes, immeasurably wide open, were still inquiring, aghast, terrified\r\nat the mystery. Why? why had he murdered her? And she had just been\r\nreduced to nothing, carried off in the fatality of murder, a creature\r\nirresponsible, whom life had rolled from vice into blood, and who\r\nhad remained tender and innocent notwithstanding, for she had never\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\nJacques was astonished. He heard the sniffing of animals, the grunting\r\nof wild boars, the roaring of lions; and he became calm, it was\r\nhimself breathing. At last! at last! he had gratified his thirst--he\r\nhad killed! Yes; he had done that. He felt elevated by ungovernable\r\njoy, by intense delight at the full satisfaction of his everlasting\r\ndesire. He experienced surprising pride, an aggrandisement of his male\r\nsovereignty. He had slaughtered the woman. He possessed her as he had\r\nso long desired to possess her, entirely to the point of destroying\r\nher. She had ceased to belong, she never would belong any more to\r\nanybody. And a bitter recollection recurred to him, that of the other\r\nmurdered victim, the corpse of President Grandmorin which he had seen\r\non that terrible night five hundred yards from the house. This delicate\r\nbody before him, so white, striped with red, was the same human shred,\r\nthe broken puppet, the limp rag that a knife makes of a creature.\r\n\r\nYes, that was it. He had killed, and he had this thing on the ground.\r\nShe had just been hurled down like the other; but on her back, the left\r\narm doubled under her right side, twisted, half-torn from her shoulder.\r\nWas it not on the night when the body of the President was found that\r\nwith heart beating fit to burst, he had sworn to dare in his turn, in\r\na prurience for murder which exasperated him like a concupiscence at\r\nthe sight of the slaughtered man? Ah! if he could only have the pluck,\r\nsatisfy himself, drive in the knife! This had germinated and developed\r\nwithin him obscurely. For a year, not an hour had gone by without him\r\nhaving advanced towards the inevitable result. Even with his arms about\r\nthe neck of this woman, and amidst her kisses, the secret work was\r\napproaching its termination; and the two murders had become united. Did\r\nnot the one show the logic of the other?\r\n\r\nThe clatter of a house falling down, a jolting of the floor drew\r\nJacques from his gaping contemplation of the dead woman. Were the doors\r\nflying into splinters? Had people arrived to arrest him? He looked\r\naround, but only to find dull, silent solitude. Ah! yes; another train!\r\nBut the man who would be knocking at the door below, the man whom\r\nhe wished to kill! He had completely forgotten him. If he regretted\r\nnothing, he already judged himself an idiot. What! what had happened?\r\nThe woman he loved, who loved him passionately, was lying on the floor\r\nwith her throat cut; while the husband, the obstacle to his happiness,\r\nwas still alive, and still advancing step by step in the obscurity.\r\nHe had been unable to wait for this man, who for months had been so\r\nsparing of the scruples of his education, and of the ideas of humanity\r\nslowly acquired and transmitted; with contempt for his own interest, he\r\nhad just been carried away by the heredity of violence, by that craving\r\nto commit murder, which in the primitive forests threw animal upon\r\nanimal.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone kill as the result of reasoning? People only kill by an\r\nimpulse of blood and nerves--the necessity to live, the joy of being\r\nstrong. He now merely experienced the lassitude of one satiated.\r\nThen he became scared and endeavoured to understand, but without\r\nfinding anything else than astonishment and the bitter sadness of the\r\nirreparable as a result of his gratified passion.\r\n\r\nThe sight of the unfortunate creature, who still gazed at him with her\r\nlook of terrified interrogation, became atrocious. Wishing to turn away\r\nhis eyes, he abruptly felt the sensation of another white form rising\r\nup at the foot of the bed. Could this be the double of the murdered\r\nwoman? Then he recognised Flore. She had already returned, while he had\r\nthe fever after the accident. Doubtless she was triumphant, at this\r\nmoment, at being avenged.\r\n\r\nHe turned icy cold with terror. He asked himself what he could be\r\nthinking of, to loiter thus in this room. He had killed, he was gorged,\r\nsatiated, intoxicated with the dreadful wine of crime. Stumbling\r\nagainst the knife which had remained on the ground, he fled, rolling\r\ndown the stairs. He opened the front door giving on the perron, as\r\nif the small one would not have been sufficiently wide, and dashed\r\nout into the pitch-dark night where his furious gallop became lost.\r\nHe never turned round. The dubious-looking house, set down aslant at\r\nthe edge of the line, remained open and desolate behind him, in its\r\nabandonment of death.\r\n\r\nCabuche, that night as on the others, had found his way through the\r\nhedge, and was prowling under the window of S\xc3\xa9verine. He knew very\r\nwell that Roubaud was expected, and was not astonished at the light\r\nfiltering through a chink in one of the shutters. But this man bounding\r\nfrom the top of the steps, this frantic gallop like that of an animal\r\ntearing away into the country, struck him dumbfounded with surprise. It\r\nwas already too late to pursue the fugitive, and the quarryman remained\r\nbewildered, full of uneasiness and hesitation before the open door,\r\ngaping upon the black hole formed by the vestibule. What had occurred?\r\nShould he enter? The heavy silence, the absolute stillness while the\r\nlamp continued burning in the upper room, gave him pangs of anguish.\r\n\r\nAt last, making up his mind, he groped his way upstairs. Before the\r\ndoor of the red bedroom, which had also been left open, he stopped.\r\nIn the placid light, he seemed to perceive in the distance a heap of\r\npetticoats lying at the foot of the bedstead. No doubt S\xc3\xa9verine was\r\nundressed. He called gently to her, feeling alarmed, while his veins\r\nbegan throbbing violently. Then he caught sight of the blood, and\r\nunderstood. With a terrible cry that came from his lacerated heart, he\r\nsprang forward. Great God! It was she, assassinated, struck down there\r\nin her pitiful nudity. He thought her still rattling, and felt such\r\ndespair, such painful shame at seeing her quite nude in her agony; that\r\nhe lifted her in a fraternal transport, in his open arms, and, placing\r\nher on the bed, drew the sheet over her.\r\n\r\nBut in this clasp, the only tenderness between them, he covered his\r\nchest and both his hands with blood. He was streaming with her gore;\r\nand at this moment he saw that Roubaud and Misard were there. Finding\r\nall the doors open, they also had just decided to come upstairs. The\r\nhusband arrived late, having stopped to talk with the gatekeeper, who\r\nhad then accompanied him, continuing the conversation on the way.\r\nBoth, in stupefaction, turned their eyes on Cabuche, whose hands were\r\ndripping with blood like those of a butcher.\r\n\r\n"The same stroke as for the President," said Misard at last, while he\r\nexamined the wound.\r\n\r\nRoubaud wagged his head up and down without answering, unable to take\r\nhis eyes off S\xc3\xa9verine, off that look of abominable terror, with the\r\nhair standing on end above the forehead, and the blue eyes immeasurably\r\nwide open, inquiring: Why?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n\r\nThree months later, on a warm June night, Jacques was driving the Havre\r\nexpress that had left Paris at 6.30. His engine, No. 608, was quite\r\nnew, and he began to know it thoroughly. It was not easy to handle,\r\nbeing restive and capricious, after the manner of those young nags\r\nwhich require to be broken in by hard work before they take kindly to\r\nharness. He often swore at it, and regretted La Lison. Moreover, he\r\nhad to watch this new locomotive very closely, and to constantly keep\r\nhis hand on the reversing-wheel. But on this particular night the sky\r\nwas so delightfully serene, that he felt inclined to be indulgent,\r\nand allowed the engine to travel along as it would, while he found\r\nenjoyment in inhaling great draughts of fresh air. Never had he been\r\nblessed with such splendid health. He was untroubled with remorse, and\r\npresented the appearance of a man relieved of anxiety, and who was\r\nperfectly tranquil and happy.\r\n\r\nHe who, as a rule, never spoke on the journey, began to joke with\r\nPecqueux, whom the management had left with him as fireman.\r\n\r\n"What has come to you?" he inquired. "You\'ve got your eyes about you\r\nlike a man who has been drinking nothing but water."\r\n\r\nPecqueux, in fact, contrary to his habit, seemed to have taken nothing\r\nand to be very gloomy.\r\n\r\n"It is necessary to have your eyes about you," he answered in a harsh\r\nvoice, "when you want to see what is going on."\r\n\r\nJacques looked at him in distrust, like a man who has not a clear\r\nconscience. The week before he had been making love to the sweetheart\r\nof his comrade, that terrible Philom\xc3\xa8ne, who for some time past had\r\nbeen purring round him like a lean, amorous cat. He had no affection\r\nfor her, but wanted to ascertain whether he was cured, now that he had\r\nsatisfied his frightful craving. Could he make love to this one without\r\nplunging a knife into her throat? On two occasions when he had been out\r\nwith her, he had felt nothing, no uncomfortable feeling, no shiver. His\r\ngreat joy, his appeased and smiling manner must be due, without his\r\nbeing aware of it, to the happiness he experienced at being like any\r\nother man.\r\n\r\nPecqueux having opened the fire-box of the engine to throw in coal,\r\nJacques stopped him.\r\n\r\n"No, no," said he, "do not make up too much fire. It is going along\r\nvery well."\r\n\r\nThe fireman in a grumbling tone uttered some abusive remarks about\r\nthe locomotive in reply, and Jacques, so as not to get angry, avoided\r\nanswering him. But he felt that the former cordial understanding of\r\nthree, no longer existed; for the good friendship between him, his\r\ncomrade, and the engine had vanished with the destruction of La Lison.\r\nThey now quarrelled about trifles, about a nut screwed up too tight,\r\nabout a shovel of coal carelessly laid on the bars. And he determined\r\nto be more prudent in regard to Philom\xc3\xa8ne, not wishing to come to open\r\nwarfare on the narrow foot-plate, which afforded him and his fireman\r\nstanding room as they were borne onward.\r\n\r\nSo long as Pecqueux played the part of an obedient dog, devoted to\r\nsuch a point that he was ready to strangle an enemy in gratitude for\r\nthe kind treatment he received, for being permitted to take his little\r\nnaps, and to polish off the remains in the provision basket, the pair\r\nlived like brothers, silent in the daily danger, and, indeed, having\r\nno need of words to understand one another. But it would become a\r\npandemonium if they ceased to agree, pent-up side by side, and swayed\r\nto and fro in the oscillation of the engine while struggling together.\r\nIt so happened that the preceding week, the company had been compelled\r\nto separate the driver and fireman on the Cherbourg express, because\r\nhaving been set at variance by a woman, the driver had taken to\r\nbullying his fireman, who no longer obeyed him. From words they went to\r\nblows, until regular stand-up fights occurred on the journey, without a\r\nthought for the long tail of passengers rolling along behind them full\r\nspeed.\r\n\r\nPecqueux opened the fire-box twice more and threw on coal in\r\ndisobedience to orders, thereby seeking, no doubt, a quarrel; but\r\nJacques, with an air of having all his attention centred on his\r\ndriving, feigned not to notice him, merely taking the precaution\r\nto turn the wheel of the injector on each occasion, to reduce the\r\npressure. It was so mild, the gentle fresh breeze as they cut through\r\nspace was so pleasant on this warm July night. At 11.05, when the\r\nexpress reached Havre, the two men polished up the engine with an\r\nappearance of being on the same good terms as formerly.\r\n\r\nAs they left the dep\xc3\xb4t to go to bed, in Rue Fran\xc3\xa7ois-Mazeline, they\r\nheard a voice calling them.\r\n\r\n"Why are you in such a hurry to be off? Step in for a minute."\r\n\r\nIt was Philom\xc3\xa8ne, who, from the doorstep of the cottage of her brother,\r\nmust have been looking out for Jacques. She had made a movement of\r\nlively annoyance on perceiving Pecqueux; and if she determined to hail\r\nthem together, it was for the pleasure of enjoying a chat with her new\r\nfriend, in spite of having to support the presence of the other.\r\n\r\n"Just leave us alone, will you?" growled Pecqueux. "Go to blazes! We\'re\r\nsleepy."\r\n\r\n"How amiable he is!" gaily resumed Philom\xc3\xa8ne. "But Monsieur Jacques is\r\nnot like you. He\'ll take a dram. Will you not, Monsieur Jacques?"\r\n\r\nThe driver was going to refuse, out of prudence, when the fireman\r\nabruptly accepted, influenced by the idea of watching them, and so\r\nmaking quite sure of their feelings towards one another. Entering the\r\nkitchen they seated themselves at the table, on which Philom\xc3\xa8ne placed\r\nglasses and a bottle of brandy, saying in a low tone:\r\n\r\n"Try not to make too much noise, because my brother is asleep upstairs,\r\nand he is not very pleased when I receive friends."\r\n\r\nThen, as she filled their glasses, she immediately added:\r\n\r\n"By the way, you know that Mother Lebleu pegged out this morning? Oh!\r\nas to that I said so: it will kill her, I said, if they put her in that\r\nlodging on the back--a regular prison! Still she lasted four months,\r\nchewing the cud of bitterness, because she could see nothing but zinc.\r\nAnd what gave her the finishing stroke, when she found it impossible\r\nto move from her armchair, was assuredly the knowledge that she would\r\nnever more be able to keep watch on Mademoiselle Guichon and Monsieur\r\nDabadie. It was a habit she had got. Yes, she was enraged at never\r\nhaving been able to catch them, and she died of it."\r\n\r\nPhilom\xc3\xa8ne paused to toss off a thimbleful of brandy, and resumed with a\r\nlaugh:\r\n\r\n"Of course there is something going on between them. Only they are too\r\nsharp! It is quite a puzzle! All the same, I think little Madame Moulin\r\nsaw them one night. But there is no fear of her talking, she is too\r\nstupid; and, besides, her husband, the assistant station-master----"\r\n\r\nAgain she broke off to exclaim:\r\n\r\n"I say, it is next week that the Roubaud case comes on for trial at\r\nRouen!"\r\n\r\nUntil then, Jacques and Pecqueux had listened to her without putting\r\nin a word. The latter simply thought her very talkative. Never had she\r\nexerted her conversational powers to such an extent with him; and he\r\nkept his eyes on her, becoming little by little heated by jealousy at\r\nseeing her so excited in the presence of his chief.\r\n\r\n"Yes," answered the driver, in a perfectly tranquil manner, "I received\r\nthe summons."\r\n\r\nPhilom\xc3\xa8ne drew nearer to him, delighted at being able to graze his\r\nelbow.\r\n\r\n"So have I," she, said. "I am a witness. Ah! Monsieur Jacques, when I\r\nwas questioned about you, for you know the examining-magistrate wished\r\nto ascertain the real truth in regard to your acquaintance with this\r\npoor lady; yes, when he questioned me, I said to him: But, monsieur, he\r\nadored her, it is impossible that he can have done her any harm! Is not\r\nthat right? I had seen you together and was in a fit position to speak."\r\n\r\n"Oh!" said the young man, with a gesture of indifference; "I was not\r\nanxious. I could say hour for hour how I passed my time. If the company\r\nhave kept me, it is because there is not the slightest thing they can\r\nreproach me with."\r\n\r\nA pause followed, and all three slowly drank their brandy.\r\n\r\n"It makes one shudder," continued Philom\xc3\xa8ne. "Just fancy, that\r\nferocious brute Cabuche whom they arrested still covered with the blood\r\nof that poor lady! What an idiot a man must be to kill a woman because\r\nhe is in love with her, as if that would help him, when the woman no\r\nlonger existed! And what I shall never forget so long as I live, was\r\nwhen Monsieur Cauche, over there on the platform, came and arrested\r\nMonsieur Roubaud as well. I was there. You know this did not happen\r\nuntil a week afterwards, when Monsieur Roubaud, the day following\r\nthe burial of his wife, resumed his duty with an air of perfect\r\ntranquillity. So then, Monsieur Cauche tapped him on the shoulder,\r\nsaying he had orders to take him to prison. What do you think of that?\r\nThose two who never left one another, who gambled together night after\r\nnight till daybreak! But when you are a commissary of police you must\r\ntake even your father and mother to the guillotine if it is your duty\r\nto do so. Monsieur Cauche does not care a fig! I caught sight of him at\r\nthe Caf\xc3\xa9 du Commerce a little while ago shuffling the cards, without\r\ntroubling any more about his friend than the great Mogul!"\r\n\r\nPecqueux, clenching his teeth, struck his fist on the table, and\r\nexclaimed with a violent oath:\r\n\r\n"If I were in the place of that Roubaud I\'d----"\r\n\r\nThen, breaking off and turning to Jacques, he added: "What! you make\r\nlove to his wife, another man kills her, and they take him off to the\r\nassizes. No; it\'s enough to make one burst with rage!"\r\n\r\n"But, you great donkey," said Philom\xc3\xa8ne, "it is because they accuse him\r\nof having urged the other to rid him of his wife. Yes, in connection\r\nwith money matters, or something else! It appears that the watch\r\nbelonging to President Grandmorin, was found in the hut of Cabuche. You\r\nremember, the gentleman who was murdered in a railway carriage eighteen\r\nmonths ago. Then they hooked that nasty job on to the one of the other\r\nday, and made a long story of it, as black as ink. I cannot explain it\r\nall to you, but it was in the newspaper where it filled at least two\r\ncolumns."\r\n\r\nJacques, who was absent-minded, did not even seem to be listening.\r\n\r\n"What is the use of puzzling our brains about it?" he murmured. "What\r\ndoes it matter to us? If the judicial authorities do not know what they\r\nare doing, how can we expect to know?"\r\n\r\nThen, with eyes lost in space, and pallid cheeks, he murmured:\r\n\r\n"In all this there is only that poor girl who excites pity! Ah! the\r\npoor, poor girl!"\r\n\r\n"As for me," concluded Pecqueux, "if anyone took it into his head to\r\ninterfere with my wench, I should begin by strangling them both. After\r\nthat, they might cut off my head. I should not care a straw."\r\n\r\nAnother silence ensued. Philom\xc3\xa8ne, who was filling up the glasses a\r\nsecond time, affected to shrug her shoulders and chuckle; but, in\r\nreality, she felt quite upset, and gave Pecqueux a searching look\r\nsideways. He had neglected his personal appearance considerably, and\r\nlooked very dirty and ragged since Mother Victoire, as a result of her\r\naccident, had become impotent, and had been obliged to relinquish her\r\npost at the station to enter an almshouse. She was no longer there,\r\ntolerant and maternal, to slip pieces of silver into his pocket, to\r\nmend his clothes, so that the other one at Havre might not accuse her\r\nof keeping their man untidy. And Philom\xc3\xa8ne, bewitched by the smart,\r\nclean look of Jacques, put on an expression of disgust.\r\n\r\n"Do you mean that you would strangle your Paris wench?" she inquired in\r\nbravado. "There is no fear of anybody carrying her off!"\r\n\r\n"That one or another!" he growled.\r\n\r\nBut she was already touching glasses in a joking vein.\r\n\r\n"Look here! to your health!" she exclaimed. "And bring your linen to\r\nme, so that I may have it washed and mended, for really you no longer\r\ndo honour, to either of us. To your health, Monsieur Jacques!"\r\n\r\nThe latter started, as if disturbed in a dream. Notwithstanding the\r\ncomplete absence of remorse and the feeling of relief and physical\r\ncomfort, in which he had been living since the murder, S\xc3\xa9verine\r\nsometimes passed before his eyes as now, moving his gentle inner self\r\nto tears. And he touched glasses, remarking precipitately to hide his\r\ntrouble:\r\n\r\n"You know that we are going to war?"\r\n\r\n"Can it be possible?" exclaimed Philom\xc3\xa8ne. "Who with?"\r\n\r\n"Why, with the Prussians," answered Jacques. "Yes, on account of one\r\nof their princes, who wishes to be King of Spain. Yesterday in the\r\nChamber they were occupied with nothing else."\r\n\r\nThen she was in despair.\r\n\r\n"Ah! well! That\'s a nice thing," said she. "They bothered us enough\r\nwith their elections, their plebiscite, and their riots at Paris! I\r\nsay, if they do fight, will they take away all the men?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! as to us, we are shunted! They cannot disorganise the railways.\r\nOnly we shall have a warm time, on account of the transport of troops\r\nand provisions! Anyhow, if it happens, everyone will have to do his\r\nduty."\r\n\r\nThereupon, he rose, noticing that she was becoming too familiar, and\r\nthat Pecqueux perceived it. Indeed, the face of the latter had become\r\ncrimson, and he was already clenching his fists.\r\n\r\n"It is time for bed," said Jacques. "Let us be off."\r\n\r\n"Yes, that will be the better thing to do," stammered the fireman.\r\n\r\nHe had grasped the arm of Philom\xc3\xa8ne, and squeezed it fit to break it.\r\nRestraining a cry of agony, she contented herself with whispering in\r\nthe ear of the driver, while the other finished his glass in a fury:\r\n\r\n"Be on your guard. He is a regular brute when he has been drinking."\r\n\r\nBut heavy footsteps could now be heard coming downstairs, and Philom\xc3\xa8ne\r\nlooked scared.\r\n\r\n"It is my brother," said she. "Slip out quick! slip out quick!"\r\n\r\nThe two men were not twenty paces from the house when they heard slaps\r\nfollowed by yells. Philom\xc3\xa8ne was being abominably chastised, like a\r\nlittle girl caught in the act, with her nose in the jam-pot. The driver\r\nstopped, ready to run to her assistance, but the fireman held him back.\r\n\r\n"What are you going to do?" he inquired; "it is no business of yours.\r\nAh! the slut! if he could only beat her to death!"\r\n\r\nOn reaching the Rue Fran\xc3\xa7ois-Mazeline, Jacques and Pecqueux went to\r\nbed without exchanging a word. The two bedsteads almost touched in the\r\nsmall room, and for a long time the men remained awake with their eyes\r\nopen, listening to the breathing of one another.\r\n\r\nIt was on the Monday that the Roubaud trial was to commence at Rouen.\r\nThis case proved a triumph for the examining-magistrate, Denizet,\r\nfor there was no lack of praise in the judicial world as to the way\r\nin which he had brought the complicated and obscure business to a\r\nsatisfactory issue. It was a masterpiece of clever analysis, said they;\r\na logical substitution for the truth; in a word, a genuine creation.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, M. Denizet had caused Cabuche to be arrested as soon as\r\nhe had visited the house at La Croix-de-Maufras a few hours after the\r\nmurder of S\xc3\xa9verine. Everything pointed openly to this man as author of\r\nthe crime: the blood trickling down him, the overwhelming evidence of\r\nRoubaud and Misard, who related how they had surprised him, alone with\r\nthe corpse, and in a state of bewilderment. Questioned, pressed, to say\r\nin what manner and for what purpose he found himself in this room, the\r\nquarryman stammered out a story, which appeared so silly, and so like\r\nthe usual run of such stories, that the examining-magistrate received\r\nit with a shrug of the shoulders.\r\n\r\nHe had been expecting this story, which was always the same, the tale\r\nof an imaginary murderer, the invented culprit, whom the real culprit\r\npretended he had heard fleeing across the dark country. This bugbear\r\nmust be a long way off, must he not, if he should still happen to be\r\nrunning? Besides, on Cabuche being asked what he was doing in front\r\nof the house at such a time, he became troubled, refused to answer,\r\nand ended by saying he was walking about. This was childish. How could\r\nanyone believe in the existence of this mysterious unknown, who came\r\nand committed a murder, and then ran off, leaving all the doors wide\r\nopen without having searched a single article of furniture, or carried\r\neven a pocket-handkerchief away with him? Where did he come from? Why\r\nhad he killed?\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the examining-magistrate having heard at the commencement\r\nof the inquiry, of the intimacy between the victim and Jacques, took\r\nmeasures to ascertain how the latter had passed his time on the day\r\nof the murder; but, apart from the accused acknowledging that he\r\nhad accompanied Jacques to Barentin, to catch the 4.14 train in the\r\nafternoon; the innkeeper at Rouen took her solemn oath that the young\r\nman, who had gone to bed immediately after his dinner, did not leave\r\nhis room until the next morning at about seven o\'clock. And, moreover,\r\na lover does not slaughter without any reason, a sweetheart whom he\r\nadores, and with whom he has never had the slightest quarrel. It would\r\nbe absurd. No, no; only one murderer was possible, a murderer who\r\nwas evident, the liberated convict found there red-handed, with the\r\nknife at his feet, that brute beast who had related a rigmarole to the\r\nrepresentative of justice, fit to send him off to sleep.\r\n\r\nBut when M. Denizet reached this point he for a moment felt\r\nembarrassed, notwithstanding his conviction and his scent, which, said\r\nhe, gave him better information than proofs. In a first search made at\r\nthe hovel of the accused, on the outskirts of the forest of B\xc3\xa9court,\r\nabsolutely nothing had been found. It having been impossible to prove\r\nrobbery, it became necessary to discover another motive for the crime.\r\nAll at once, in the hazard of an examination, Misard put him on the\r\ntrack, by relating that he had one night seen Cabuche scale the wall of\r\nthe property to look through the window of the room occupied by Madame\r\nRoubaud who was going to bed.\r\n\r\nJacques, on being questioned in his turn, quietly related what\r\nhe knew: the mute adoration of the quarryman for the wife of the\r\nassistant station-master, his ardent desire to be of service to her,\r\never running after her as if fastened to her apron strings. No room,\r\ntherefore, remained for doubt: bestial passion alone had urged him to\r\nthe crime. Everything became quite clear: the man returning by the door\r\nto which he might have a key, leaving it open in his excitement, then\r\nthe struggle which had brought about the murder.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, one final objection to this theory occurred to the\r\nexamining-magistrate. It appeared singular that the man, aware of the\r\nimminent arrival of the husband, should have chosen the very hour\r\nwhen Roubaud might surprise him. But on careful consideration this\r\ncircumstance turned against the accused, and completely overwhelmed\r\nhim by establishing that he must have acted under the influence of a\r\nsupreme crisis, driven crazy by the thought that if he failed to take\r\nadvantage of the time when S\xc3\xa9verine was still alone, he would lose her\r\nfor ever, as she would be leaving on the morrow. From that moment, the\r\nconviction of the examining-magistrate was complete and unalterable.\r\n\r\nHarassed by interrogations, taken and retaken through the skein\r\nof clever questions, careless of the traps laid for him, Cabuche\r\nobstinately abided by his first version. He was passing along the road,\r\nbreathing the fresh night air, when an individual brushed against him\r\nas he tore headlong away. The fugitive dashed by him so rapidly in the\r\nobscurity, that he could not even say which way he fled.\r\n\r\nThen, seized with anxiety and having cast a glance at the house, he\r\nperceived that the door stood wide open, and he ended by making up his\r\nmind to enter and go upstairs. There he found the dead woman, who was\r\nstill warm, and who looked at him with her great eyes. In lifting her\r\non the bed, thinking her still alive, he covered himself with blood.\r\nThat was all he knew, and he repeated the same tale, never varying in\r\na single detail, with an air of confining himself to a story arranged\r\nbeforehand. When an effort was made to make him say something more, he\r\nlooked wild, and remained silent, after the fashion of a man of limited\r\nintelligence who did not understand.\r\n\r\nThe first time M. Denizet addressed questions to him on the subject of\r\nhis intense passion for the deceased, he became very red, like some\r\nlad reproached with his first love affair; and he denied, he resisted\r\nthe accusation of having thought of becoming intimate with this lady,\r\nas if it was something very wicked and unavowable, a delicate and also\r\na mysterious matter, buried in the innermost recess of his heart, and\r\nwhich he was not called upon to unbosom to anyone. No, no! He did not\r\nlove her. He never desired any intimacy with her. They would never make\r\nhim speak of what seemed to him a profanation, now that she was dead.\r\n\r\nBut this obstinacy in denying a fact that several of the witnesses\r\naffirmed, turned against him. Naturally, according to the theory of the\r\nprosecution, it was to his interest to conceal his furious passion. And\r\nwhen the examining-magistrate, assembling all the proofs, sought to\r\ntear the truth from him by striking a decisive blow, accusing him point\r\nblank of murder and rape, he flew into a mad rage of protestation. He\r\ndo that! he who respected as a saint! The gendarmes who were called\r\nin, had to put restraint on him; while he, with great oaths, talked of\r\nstrangling the whole show. The examining-magistrate put him down as\r\na most dangerous, cunning scoundrel, but whose violence broke out in\r\nspite of all, and proved a sufficient avowal of the crimes he denied.\r\n\r\nEach time the murder was brought up, Cabuche flew into a fury, shouting\r\nthat it was the other one, the mysterious fugitive, who had committed\r\nthe crime. The inquiry had gone so far when M. Denizet, by chance, made\r\na discovery which suddenly transformed the case, and gave it ten times\r\nmore importance. He scented out the truth, as he remarked. Influenced\r\nby a sort of presentiment, he searched the hovel occupied by Cabuche, a\r\nsecond time, himself; and behind a beam, came upon a hiding-place where\r\nhe found ladies\' gloves and pocket-handkerchiefs, while beneath them\r\nlay a gold watch, which he recognised with great delight. This was the\r\nwatch belonging to President Grandmorin which the examining-magistrate\r\nhad so ardently endeavoured to trace formerly. It was a strong watch\r\nwith two initials entwined, and inside the case it bore the number of\r\nthe maker, 2516. The whole business stood out illuminated, as in a\r\nflash of lightning, the past became connected with the present, and\r\nwhen he had joined the chain of facts together again, their logic\r\nenchanted him.\r\n\r\nBut the consequences would stretch so far that, without alluding\r\nto the watch, he at first questioned Cabuche about the gloves and\r\npocket-handkerchiefs. The accused for an instant had the avowal ready\r\non the lips; yes, he adored her to such an extent as to kiss the gowns\r\nshe had worn, to pick up, to steal behind her, anything she happened\r\nto let fall: bits of laces, hooks, pins. Then a feeling of shame and\r\ninvincible modesty made him silent. When the judge, making up his\r\nmind, thrust the watch before his eyes, he looked at it bewildered. He\r\nremembered perfectly; he had been surprised to find the watch tied up\r\nin the corner of a pocket-handkerchief that he had taken from under a\r\nbolster and carried away with him as a prize. Then it had remained in\r\nhis hut, while he racked his brain thinking how he could return it.\r\n\r\nOnly what would be the use of relating all this? He would have to own\r\nto the other thefts--those odds and ends, the linen that smelt so\r\nnice, and of which he felt so ashamed. Already, everything he said was\r\ndisbelieved. Besides, his power of understanding began to fail him,\r\nhis simple mind became confused, and what went on around him commenced\r\nto take the aspect of a horrible dream. He no longer flew into a\r\nrage when accused of murder, but looked as if he had lost his senses,\r\nrepeating in answer to every question put to him that he did not know.\r\nIn regard to the gloves and handkerchiefs, he did not know. In regard\r\nto the watch, he did not know. The examining-magistrate plagued him to\r\ndeath. He had only to leave him in peace and guillotine him at once.\r\n\r\nThe following day, M. Denizet had Roubaud arrested. Strong in his\r\nalmighty power, he had issued the warrant in one of those moments of\r\ninspiration, when he put faith in the genius of his perspicacity,\r\nand even before he had a sufficiently serious charge against the\r\nassistant station-master. In spite of the many obscure points that\r\nstill remained, he guessed this man to be the pivot, the source of the\r\ndouble crime; and he triumphed at once when he seized a document making\r\neverything over to the survivor of the two, which Roubaud and S\xc3\xa9verine\r\nhad executed before Ma\xc3\xaetre Colin, notary at Havre, a week after coming\r\ninto possession of La Croix-de-Maufras.\r\n\r\nFrom that time the whole business became clear to his mind, with a\r\ncertainty of reasoning, a strength of evidence which conveyed to the\r\nframework of the prosecution such indestructible solidity that the\r\ntruth itself would have seemed less true, less logical, and tainted\r\nwith more imagination. Roubaud was a coward, who, on two occasions, not\r\ndaring to kill with his own hand, had made use of this violent brute\r\nCabuche. The first time, being impatient to inherit from President\r\nGrandmorin, the terms of whose will he knew, and aware, moreover, of\r\nthe rancour of the quarryman for this gentleman, he had pushed him\r\ninto the coup\xc3\xa9 at Rouen, after arming him with a knife. Then, when the\r\n10,000 frcs. had been shared, the two accomplices would perhaps never\r\nhave met again, had not murder engendered murder.\r\n\r\nAnd it was here the examining-magistrate displayed that deep knowledge\r\nof criminal psychology which was so much admired, for he now declared\r\nthat he had never ceased to keep an eye on Cabuche, his conviction\r\nbeing that the first murder would mathematically bring about another.\r\nEighteen months had sufficed for this: the Roubauds were at sixes\r\nand sevens. The husband had lost the 5,000 frcs. at cards, while the\r\nwife had come to the point of taking a sweetheart to amuse herself.\r\nDoubtless she refused to sell La Croix-de-Maufras, in fear lest he\r\nshould squander the money; perhaps in their continual quarrels she\r\nthreatened to give him up to justice. In any case, the evidence of\r\nnumerous persons established the absolute disunion of the couple, and\r\nhere at last appeared the distant consequence of the first crime.\r\nCabuche now comes forward again with his brutish instincts, and the\r\nhusband, in the background, arms this man with the knife, to definitely\r\nensure possession of this accursed house, which had already cost one\r\nhuman life, for himself.\r\n\r\nThat was the truth, the appalling truth, everything led up to it: the\r\nwatch discovered in the hut of the quarryman, and particularly the two\r\ncorpses, both struck with the same identical blow in the throat, by\r\nthe same hand, with the same weapon--that knife picked up in the room.\r\nNevertheless, the prosecution had a doubt on this point. The wound of\r\nthe President appeared to have been inflicted by a sharper and smaller\r\nblade.\r\n\r\nRoubaud, in the drowsy, heavy manner now peculiar to him, at first\r\nanswered Yes or No to the questions of M. Denizet. He did not seem\r\nsurprised at his arrest, for in the slow disorganisation of his being,\r\neverything had become indifferent to him. To get him to talk, the\r\nexamining-magistrate gave him a warder who never left him. With this\r\nman he played cards from morning to night, and was perfectly happy.\r\nBesides, he was convinced of the guilt of Cabuche, who alone could be\r\nthe murderer. Interrogated as to Jacques, he shrugged his shoulders\r\nwith a laugh, thereby showing that he was aware of the intimacy that\r\nhad existed between the driver and S\xc3\xa9verine. But when M. Denizet,\r\nafter sounding him, ended by developing his system, inciting him,\r\nconfounding him with his complicity, endeavouring to wrench an avowal\r\nfrom him, he, in his confusion at finding himself discovered, became\r\nremarkably circumspect.\r\n\r\nWhat was this that was being related to him? It was no longer he, it\r\nwas the quarryman who had killed the President just as he had killed\r\nS\xc3\xa9verine; yet in both instances he, Roubaud, was the guilty one,\r\nbecause the other had struck on his account and in his place. This\r\ncomplicated legend stupefied and filled him with distrust. Assuredly\r\nthis must be a trap. The lie was advanced, to force him to confess\r\nhis part in the first crime. From the moment of his arrest he felt\r\nconvinced that the old business was coming to the surface again.\r\n\r\nConfronted with Cabuche, he declared he did not know him. Only, when\r\nhe repeated he had found him red with blood before the corpse, the\r\nquarryman flew into a rage, and a violent scene, full of extreme\r\nconfusion ensued, embroiling matters more than ever. Three days passed,\r\nand the examining-magistrate plied the prisoners with question upon\r\nquestion, convinced that they had arrived at an understanding to play\r\nthe farce of being hostile to one another. Roubaud, who felt very\r\nweary, had made up his mind to refrain from answering, but all at once,\r\nin a moment of impatience, eager to end the business, he gave way to a\r\nsecret impulse that had been troubling him for months, and burst out\r\nwith the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth.\r\n\r\nIt so happened that on this particular day, M. Denizet was exerting his\r\ncunning to the utmost. Seated at his writing-table, veiling his eyes\r\nwith their heavy lids, while his mobile lips grew thin in an effort of\r\nsagacity, he had been exhausting himself for an hour in endeavouring,\r\nby clever artifices, to ensnare this incrassated prisoner, covered\r\nwith unhealthy yellow fat, whom he considered remarkably crafty,\r\nnotwithstanding his ponderous frame. And he thought he had tracked\r\nhim step by step, enlaced him on all sides, caught him in the trap at\r\nlast, when Roubaud, with the gesture of a man driven to extremities,\r\nexclaimed that he had had enough of the business, and that he preferred\r\nto confess so that he might be tormented no further. As there appeared\r\nto be a desire to make him out guilty in spite of all, let it at least\r\nbe for something he had really done.\r\n\r\nBut, as he unfolded his story, his wife led astray by Grandmorin,\r\nhis jealous rage on hearing of this abomination, and how he had\r\nkilled, and why he had taken the 10,000 frcs., the eyelids of the\r\nexamining-magistrate rose to the accompaniment of a frown of doubt,\r\nwhile irresistible incredulity, professional incredulity, caused his\r\nlips to distend in a jeering pout. He smiled outright when Roubaud\r\ncame to the end. The rascal was cleverer than he had thought: to take\r\nthe first crime for himself, make it a purely passionate crime, free\r\nhimself from all premeditation of theft, particularly of any complicity\r\nin the murder of S\xc3\xa9verine was certainly a hardy man\xc5\x93uvre which gave\r\nproof of unusual intelligence and determination. Only, the thing did\r\nnot hold together.\r\n\r\n"Come, Roubaud," said M. Denizet, "you must not take us for children.\r\nSo you pretend that you were jealous, and that it was in a transport of\r\njealousy that you committed the murder?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly," answered the other.\r\n\r\n"And, if we admit what you relate," resumed the examining-magistrate,\r\n"you knew nothing about the intimacy of your wife with the President\r\nat the time you married her. Does that appear likely? In your case\r\neverything tends to prove, on the contrary, that the speculation was\r\nsuggested to you, discussed, and accepted. You are given a young\r\ngirl, brought up like a young lady, she receives a marriage portion,\r\nher protector becomes your protector, you know that he leaves you\r\na country house in his will, and you pretend you had no suspicion,\r\nabsolutely none at all! Get along with you. You knew everything,\r\notherwise your marriage would be incomprehensible. Besides, the\r\nverification of one simple fact will suffice to confound you. You are\r\nnot jealous. Dare to say again that you are jealous!"\r\n\r\n"I say the truth," answered Roubaud. "I killed him in a fit of jealous\r\nrage."\r\n\r\n"Then," said the examining-magistrate, "after killing the President,\r\non account of an intimacy that dated back some time, which was of a\r\nvague nature and which for that matter you invent, explain to me how\r\nit was that you allowed your wife to have a sweetheart. Yes; that\r\nstrapping fellow Jacques Lantier! Everybody has spoken to me about this\r\nacquaintance. You, yourself, have not attempted to conceal from me that\r\nyou were aware of it. You freely allowed them to do what they pleased.\r\nWhy?"\r\n\r\nRoubaud, overcome and with troubled eyes, looked fixedly into space\r\nwithout finding an explanation, and ended by stammering:\r\n\r\n"I do not know. I killed the other; I did not kill this one."\r\n\r\n"Then," concluded the examining-magistrate, "do not tell me, again,\r\nthat you are a jealous man who avenges himself. And I do not advise you\r\nto repeat this romance to the gentlemen of the jury, for they would\r\nonly shrug their shoulders. Believe me, change your system. Truth alone\r\ncan save you."\r\n\r\nHenceforth, the more Roubaud stubbornly told this truth, the greater\r\nliar he was proved to be. Besides, everything went against him, and\r\nto such a point that his previous examination, on the occasion of the\r\nfirst inquiry in connection with the Grandmorin murder, which should\r\nhave served to support his new version of the crime, because he had\r\ndenounced Cabuche, became, on the contrary, the proof of a remarkably\r\nclever understanding between them.\r\n\r\nThe examining-magistrate refined the psychology of the affair with a\r\nveritable passion for his calling. Never, said he, had he penetrated\r\nso thoroughly to the bottom of human nature; and it was by divination\r\nrather than observation, for he flattered himself he belonged to the\r\nschool of far-seeing and fascinating judges, those who have the power\r\nof upsetting a man by a glance. Besides, proofs were no longer wanting,\r\nand conjointly formed a crushing charge. Henceforth, the prosecution\r\nwere in possession of a solid basis to work upon, and the certainty of\r\nthe guilt of the prisoners burst forth in dazzling brightness like the\r\nlight of the sun.\r\n\r\nAnd what added to the glory of M. Denizet was the way in which he\r\nbrought out the double crime in one lump, after having patiently\r\npieced it all together in the most profound secrecy. Since the noisy\r\nsuccess of the plebiscite, the country continued in a state of feverish\r\nagitation, similar to that vertigo which precedes and ushers in great\r\ncatastrophes. Among the society of this expiring Empire, in political\r\ncircles, and particularly in the Press, a feeling of unceasing\r\nanxiety was manifest, coupled with an exaltation in which joy even\r\ntook the form of sickly violence. So when it was ascertained, after\r\nthe murder of a woman in the solitude of that isolated house at La\r\nCroix-de-Maufras, with what a stroke of genius the examining-magistrate\r\nat Rouen had just disinterred the old case of Grandmorin and connected\r\nit with the new crime, the news was hailed by an explosion of triumph\r\namong the newspapers intimately connected with the Government.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time there still appeared all sorts of jokes in the\r\nopposition news-sheets about that legendary assassin, who remained\r\nundiscovered--an invention of the police put forward to conceal the\r\nturpitude of certain high and mighty personages who found themselves\r\ninvolved. The response was about to be decisive. The murderer and his\r\naccomplice had been arrested, the memory of President Grandmorin would\r\nstand out intact. Then the bickering began again, and the excitement\r\nat Paris and Rouen increased from day to day. Apart from this hideous\r\nromance which haunted the imagination of everyone, people became\r\nimpassioned with the idea that, as the irrefutable truth had at length\r\nbeen discovered, the State would be consolidated thereby.\r\n\r\nM. Denizet, summoned to Paris, presented himself at the private\r\nresidence of M. Camy-Lamotte in the Rue du Rocher. He found the chief\r\nsecretary to the Minister of Justice on his feet in the centre of his\r\nsevere-looking study, with a face more emaciated and fatigued than on\r\nthe former occasion; for he was on the decline, and a prey to sadness,\r\nnotwithstanding his scepticism. It seemed as if he felt a presentiment\r\nthat the downfall of the r\xc3\xa9gime he served was about to happen in\r\nthe full splendour of its apotheosis. For the two previous days, he\r\nhad been the victim of an inner struggle. He had not yet been able\r\nto decide what use he would make of the letter from S\xc3\xa9verine to the\r\nPresident which he still had by him. This letter would upset all the\r\nsystem of the prosecution, by bringing irrefutable proof to bear upon\r\nthe version put forward by Roubaud.\r\n\r\nBut on the previous evening, the Emperor had told him that this\r\ntime he insisted on justice being done, apart from any influence\r\nwhatsoever, even if his Government suffered thereby. This was simply\r\na straightforward utterance, or maybe the result of a superstitious\r\nidea that a single act of injustice after the acclamation of the\r\ncountry, might change its destiny. And if the chief secretary had no\r\nconscientious scruples, having reduced the things of this world to a\r\nmere matter of mechanism, he nevertheless felt troubled at the command\r\nhe had received, and was asking himself whether he ought to love his\r\nmaster to the point of disobeying him?\r\n\r\nM. Denizet at once burst into an exclamation of triumph.\r\n\r\n"Well," said he, "my scent did not deceive me! It was Cabuche who\r\nmurdered the President. Only there was some truth, I acknowledge, in\r\nthe other clue, and I felt myself that the case against Roubaud looked\r\nsuspicious. Anyhow, we have them both now."\r\n\r\nM. Camy-Lamotte fixed his pale eyes on him.\r\n\r\n"So all the facts in the bundle of papers sent me," he said, "are\r\nproved, and you are absolutely convinced?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! absolutely!" answered M. Denizet, without the slightest\r\nhesitation. "The evidence forms a perfect chain. I do not remember a\r\nsingle case in which the crime followed a more logical course, and one\r\nmore easy to determine in advance."\r\n\r\n"But Roubaud protests," observed M. Camy-Lamotte; "he takes the first\r\nmurder on his own shoulders; he relates a tale about his wife having\r\nbeen led astray, and how he, mad with jealousy, killed his victim in a\r\nfit of blind rage. The opposition newspapers relate all this."\r\n\r\n"Oh! yes, they relate it as gossip, without daring to put faith in it.\r\nJealous! this Roubaud who facilitates the meetings of his wife and her\r\nsweetheart! Ah! he may repeat this story at the assize court, but he\r\nwill not succeed in raising the scandal he desires. Why not give some\r\nproof? But he produces nothing. It is true that he speaks of a letter\r\nhe made his wife write, and which should have been found among the\r\npapers of the President. You, sir, sorted those papers, I believe, and\r\nyou would have come across it, would you not?"\r\n\r\nM. Camy-Lamotte did not reply. It was a fact that the scandal would\r\nfinally be buried, by allowing the examining-magistrate to proceed\r\nwith his system, the memory of the President would be freed from\r\nan abominable taint, and the Empire would benefit by this noisy\r\nrehabilitation of one of its creatures. Besides, as this Roubaud\r\nacknowledged himself guilty, what mattered it for the purpose of\r\njustice whether he was condemned for one version or the other? It was\r\ntrue that there remained Cabuche; but, if this man had nothing to do\r\nwith the first murder, he appeared to be really the author of the\r\nsecond. Then justice itself was but a final illusion! Is not the idea\r\nof wishing to be just a snare, when truth is clouded in such dense\r\nobscurity? It would be much better to be wise, and prop up this society\r\non the wane, that threatened ruin.\r\n\r\n"That is so, is it not?" inquired M. Denizet. "You did not find this\r\nletter?"\r\n\r\nAgain M. Camy-Lamotte raised his eyes to him; and, being himself master\r\nof the position, he took on his own conscience the remorse that had\r\ndisturbed the Emperor, and quietly answered:\r\n\r\n"I found absolutely nothing."\r\n\r\nThen, all smiles and with great affability, he showered congratulations\r\non the examining-magistrate. Barely a slight pleat at the corners of\r\nhis mouth indicated an expression of invincible irony. Never had an\r\ninquiry been conducted with so much penetration; and it was decided in\r\nthe proper quarter that he should be summoned to Paris as counsellor\r\nafter the vacation. And in this manner M. Camy-Lamotte conducted his\r\nvisitor to the landing.\r\n\r\n"You alone have seen clearly through the whole business," said he, in\r\nconclusion; "and your perspicacity is really admirable. From the moment\r\ntruth speaks, nothing can stop it, neither personal interest, nor even\r\nState-policy. Proceed. Let the case take its course, whatever the\r\nconsequences may be."\r\n\r\n"That is absolutely the duty of the magistracy," added M. Denizet, who\r\nbowed and took his departure beaming with delight.\r\n\r\nWhen M. Camy-Lamotte was alone, he first of all lighted a candle; then\r\nhe went and took the note, written by S\xc3\xa9verine, from the drawer where\r\nhe had placed it. The candle was burning very high. He unfolded the\r\nletter, wishing to read the two lines; and the remembrance came back to\r\nhim of this delicate criminal with blue eyes, who had formerly stirred\r\nhim with such tender sympathy. Now she was dead, and he saw her again\r\nin tragedy. Who knew the secret she must have carried away with her?\r\nCertainly truth and justice were illusions! And as he approached the\r\nletter to the flame and it caught alight, he felt very sad, as if he\r\nhad the presentiment of misfortune. What was the good of destroying\r\nthis proof, of loading his conscience with this action if the Empire\r\nwas destined to be swept away, like the pinch of black ash fallen from\r\nhis fingers?\r\n\r\nM. Denizet concluded the inquiry in less than a week. He found the\r\nWestern Railway Company extremely willing to give him assistance. All\r\nthe papers he desired, as well as all the evidence likely to be useful,\r\nwere placed at his disposal; for the company, also, had the keenest\r\ndesire to see the end of this deplorable scandal connected with one of\r\nits staff which, ascending through the complicated machinery of its\r\norganisation, had threatened to disturb even its board of directors.\r\nIt became necessary to remove the mortified limb with all speed. And\r\nso, M. Dabadie, Moulin, and others from Havre again filed through the\r\nroom of the examining-magistrate, giving the most disastrous details\r\nin regard to the bad conduct of Roubaud; next came M. Bessi\xc3\xa8re, the\r\nstation-master at Barentin, as well as several of the servants of the\r\ncompany at Rouen, whose evidence proved of decisive importance, in\r\nrespect to the first murder; then, M. Vandorpe, the station-master at\r\nParis, Misard, the signalman, and the headguard, Henri Dauvergne--the\r\ntwo last being particularly affirmative concerning the complacent\r\nconjugal easiness of the accused. Henri, whom S\xc3\xa9verine had looked after\r\nat La Croix-de-Maufras, even ventured to relate that one night while\r\nstill weak he believed he heard Roubaud and Cabuche concerting together\r\nunder the window. This went a long way towards explaining matters, and\r\nupset the system of the two accused, who pretended they were unknown\r\nto one another. The entire staff of the company raised a cry of\r\nreprobation. Everyone pitied the unfortunate victims, that poor young\r\nwoman for whose shortcomings there was so much excuse; that upright old\r\ngentleman, whose memory was now cleared of the ugly stories which had\r\nbeen circulated respecting him.\r\n\r\nBut it was in the Grandmorin family, particularly, that this new trial\r\nhad aroused the passions again, and if M. Denizet still met with\r\npowerful support from this quarter, he had to struggle to maintain\r\nthe integrity of his system. The Lachesnayes chaunted victory, for,\r\nexasperated at the legacy of La Croix-de-Maufras, bleeding with\r\navarice, they had never ceased insisting on the guilt of Roubaud. So\r\nwhen the case came to the surface again, the only thing they saw in\r\nit was an opportunity to attack the will; and as there existed but\r\none way of obtaining the revocation of the legacy, that of depriving\r\nS\xc3\xa9verine under a judgment of forfeiture by reason of ingratitude, they\r\naccepted, in part, the version of Roubaud; namely, that his wife was an\r\naccomplice who had assisted him to kill the President, although not out\r\nof vengeance for an imaginary infamy, but for the purpose of robbing\r\nhim. The examining-magistrate therefore entered into a conflict with\r\nthem, particularly with Berthe, who showed herself very bitter against\r\nher old friend, the murdered woman, whom she charged abominably; while\r\nhe defended her with heat, flying into a temper when anyone touched his\r\nmasterpiece--that edifice of logic, so well erected, as he proudly said\r\nhimself, that if one piece were removed it would all tumble down.\r\n\r\nIn this connection a very lively scene occurred in his private room,\r\nbetween the Lachesnayes and Madame Bonnehon. The latter, who, on\r\nthe former occasion, had supported the Roubauds, had found herself\r\ncompelled to abandon the husband; but she continued to stand up for his\r\nwife, by reason of a sort of tender complicity, being very tolerant in\r\nregard to beauty and matters of the heart, and she was quite agitated\r\nwith this tragic romance bespattered with blood.\r\n\r\nShe spoke out very plainly, and was full of disdain for money. Was\r\nher niece not ashamed to return to this question of the legacy? To\r\npronounce S\xc3\xa9verine guilty would be to accept the pretended confession\r\nof Roubaud in its entirety, and taint the memory of the President\r\nafresh. Had not the inquiry so ingeniously established the truth, it\r\nwould have been necessary to invent it, for the honour of the family.\r\nAnd she spoke rather bitterly about Rouennais society, which made such\r\na fuss anent the matter; that society she no longer reigned over now\r\nthat age had come, and she was losing even her opulent blonde beauty\r\nof a goddess of ripe years. Yes; again on the previous evening, at the\r\nhouse of Madame Leboucq, the wife of the counsellor, that tall, elegant\r\nbrunette who had dethroned her, the guests whispered broad anecdotes\r\ntogether: the adventure of Louisette, and everything public malignity\r\ncould invent.\r\n\r\nAt this moment, M. Denizet intervened to inform her that M. Leboucq\r\nwould sit as assessor at the coming assizes, and the Lachesnayes, who\r\nfelt uneasy, held their tongues with an air of giving in. But Madame\r\nBonnehon allayed their alarm, remarking that she was certain justice\r\nwould be done; the assizes would be presided over by her old friend M.\r\nDesbazeilles, whose rheumatism only permitted him the recollection of\r\nthe past, in the matter of gallantry; and the second assessor would\r\nbe M. Chaumette, the father of the young substitute who was under her\r\nprotection. She therefore had no anxiety, although a melancholy smile\r\nplayed on her lips when she mentioned this gentleman, whose son had\r\nlatterly been noticed as a visitor at the house of Madame Leboucq,\r\nwhere she herself had sent him, so that there might be no impediment to\r\nhis future.\r\n\r\nWhen the famous trial at last began, the rumour of approaching war and\r\nthe agitation that spread all over France, prevented a good deal of the\r\nreverberation that the proceedings would otherwise have occasioned.\r\nRouen, nevertheless, was for three days in a high state of fever. A\r\nregular crush occurred at the entrance to the court, and the reserved\r\nseats were invaded by ladies of the town.\r\n\r\nNever had the ancient palace of the Dukes of Normandy accommodated\r\nsuch an affluence of people since it had been fitted up as a Palace of\r\nJustice. The trial took place in the last days of June. The afternoons\r\nwere warm and sunny, and the bright light lit up the ten stained-glass\r\nwindows, bathing in luminosity the oak woodwork, the white stone\r\ncrucifix, which stood out at the end of the room against the red\r\nhangings sprinkled with bees, as well as the celebrated ceiling of\r\nthe time of Louis XII. with its carved squares gilded in very old and\r\nsoftly toned gold.\r\n\r\nThe public were already stifling before the proceedings commenced.\r\nWomen stood on tiptoe to see the various incriminating articles lying\r\nspread out on the table: the watch belonging to Grandmorin, the\r\nblood-stained night-dress of S\xc3\xa9verine, and the knife that had served\r\nfor the two murders. The gentleman defending Cabuche, an advocate from\r\nParis, was also a centre of interest. In the jury-box sat twelve stout\r\nand grave Rouennais buttoned up in their frock-coats. And when the\r\njudges entered, there was so much pushing among the public who were\r\nstanding, that the President at once had to threaten that he would have\r\nthe court cleared.\r\n\r\nAt last the case was called on, and the jury sworn. Reading over\r\nthe names of the witnesses caused another stir among the crowd who\r\nwere burning with curiosity. At those of Madame Bonnehon and M. de\r\nLachesnaye the heads swayed from side to side; but Jacques particularly\r\nimpassioned the ladies, who followed him with their eyes. As soon as\r\nthe accused were brought in, each between two gendarmes, the public\r\nnever ceased looking at them; and, criticising their appearance, found\r\nthat they both looked low and ferocious, like a couple of bandits.\r\nRoubaud, in his dark jacket, with a necktie arranged after the manner\r\nof a person neglectful of his appearance, caused surprise by his\r\nprematurely old manner, and his stupid-looking face bursting with fat.\r\nAs to Cabuche, he was as everyone expected to find him. Wearing a long\r\nblue blouse he seemed the very type of an assassin, with enormous\r\nfists, and a carnivorous jaw. Just one of those fellows whom you would\r\nnot care to knock up against at the corner of a wood on a dark night.\r\n\r\nThe examination of the prisoner confirmed this bad impression, and some\r\nof his replies aroused violent murmurs. To all the questions addressed\r\nto him by the President, Cabuche answered that he did not know. He did\r\nnot know how it was that the watch had got to his hut, he did not know\r\nwhy he had allowed the real assassin to run away. He persevered in his\r\nstory of this mysterious unknown, whose flight he had heard in the\r\nimpenetrable darkness.\r\n\r\nQuestioned as to his bestial passion for his unfortunate victim, he\r\nbegan stammering in such a sudden, violent fit of anger, that the two\r\ngendarmes seized him by the arms. No, no; he did not love her, he\r\ndid not want her; all these tales were falsehoods. The mere thought\r\nwould have been an infamy--she who was a lady, whereas he had been in\r\nprison and lived like a savage! Then, when he became calm, he fell into\r\ndoleful silence, confining himself to monosyllables, indifferent to the\r\nverdict and sentence that might ensue.\r\n\r\nRoubaud, in the same way, kept to what the accusation called his\r\nsystem. He related how and why he had killed Grandmorin, and denied all\r\nparticipation in the murder of his wife; but he did so in broken and\r\nalmost incoherent phrases, with sudden failures of memory, and with\r\neyes so troubled, and a voice so thick, that at times he seemed to\r\nsearch for and invent the details. But as the President urged him on,\r\npointing out the absurdities in his narrative, he ended by shrugging\r\nhis shoulders and refused to answer. What was the use of speaking the\r\ntruth, since lies were logic?\r\n\r\nThis attitude of aggressive disdain for the bench did him the utmost\r\ninjury. Everyone also observed the profound unconcern of the two\r\naccused for one another, which seemed to be a proof that they had come\r\nto an understanding beforehand, and carried it out with extraordinary\r\nstrength of will. They pretended they were strangers, and even accused\r\neach other, solely for the purpose of embarrassing the bench. When the\r\nexamination of the two prisoners came to an end the case was already\r\ntried, so cleverly had the President put his questions. Roubaud and\r\nCabuche had fallen head over ears into the traps set for them, whilst\r\nappearing to deliver themselves up. A few witnesses of no importance\r\nwere also heard on that day. Towards five o\'clock the heat had become\r\nso unbearable that two ladies fainted.\r\n\r\nGreat sensation was caused on the morrow by the examination of certain\r\nother witnesses. Madame Bonnehon had a genuine success of superiority\r\nand tact. The members of the staff of the railway company, M. Vandorpe,\r\nM. Bessi\xc3\xa8re, M. Dabadie, and particularly M. Cauche were listened\r\nto with interest. The commissary of police proved extremely prolix,\r\nrelating how he knew Roubaud very well from having frequently played\r\na game with him at the Caf\xc3\xa9 du Commerce. Henri Dauvergne repeated his\r\noverwhelming testimony respecting his conviction of having, in his\r\nfeverish drowsiness, overheard the two prisoners concerting together in\r\nlow voices. Questioned as to S\xc3\xa9verine, he displayed great discretion\r\ngiving it to be understood that he had been in love with her, but\r\nfinding she had a sweetheart, he had loyally effaced himself.\r\n\r\nSo when this same sweetheart, Jacques Lantier, at length came forward,\r\na buzz ascended from the crowd. Some people stood up to get a better\r\nview of him, and even the jury bestirred themselves in a movement of\r\ndeep attention. Jacques, who was very calm, leant with both hands on\r\nthe iron bar in front of him in the attitude he usually took when\r\ndriving his engine. His appearance in court, which should have troubled\r\nhim profoundly, left him absolute lucidity of mind. It seemed as if\r\nthe case did not concern him in any way. He was about to give his\r\ntestimony as a stranger and an innocent man. Since the crime he had not\r\nfelt a single shiver, nor did he even think of these matters, which\r\nwere banished from his recollection. His organs were in a state of\r\nequilibrium, and his health was perfect. Here again, at this bar, he\r\nexperienced neither remorse nor scruple, being absolutely unconscious.\r\n\r\nHe immediately cast a clear glance at Roubaud and Cabuche. He knew the\r\nfirst to be guilty, but he gave him a slight nod, without reflecting\r\nthat everybody was aware at present that he had been the sweetheart of\r\nhis wife. Then, he smiled at the other, the innocent man, whose place\r\nin the dock he should have occupied: a good brute at the bottom, in\r\nspite of his look of a bandit, a strapping fellow whom he had seen at\r\nwork, and whose hand he had grasped.\r\n\r\nJacques gave his evidence with perfect ease, answering in short,\r\nclear sentences the questions that were put to him by the President,\r\nwho, after interrogating him at length about his intimacy with the\r\nvictim, made him relate his departure from La Croix-de-Maufras a few\r\nhours before the murder: how he had gone to take the train at Barentin\r\nand how he had slept at Rouen. Cabuche and Roubaud listened to him,\r\nconfirming his answers by their attitude.\r\n\r\nAt this moment, an unspeakable feeling of sadness took possession of\r\nthese three men. Deathlike silence reigned in the room, and the jury\r\nexperienced an emotion occasioned they knew not by what, which caused a\r\nlump to rise in their throats. It was truth that was passing mute.\r\n\r\nIn reply to a question of the President, who desired to know what\r\nJacques thought of the unknown figure, who, according to the story of\r\nthe quarryman, had vanished in the obscurity, he contented himself by\r\nshaking his head, as if he did not wish to overload a prisoner.\r\n\r\nAn incident then occurred which completely upset the public. Tears\r\nwelled in the eyes of Jacques, and overflowing, trickled down his\r\ncheeks. S\xc3\xa9verine, as he had already seen her once before, had just\r\nrisen up before him--that wretched, murdered woman, whose image he had\r\ncarried away with him, with her blue eyes, immoderately wide open, and\r\nher black hair standing on end on her forehead like a helmet of terror.\r\nHe still adored her, and seized with immense pity, he wept abundant\r\ntears, unconscious of his crime, forgetful of being amidst this crowd.\r\nSome of the ladies, affected by this display of tenderness, began to\r\nsob. The grief of the sweetheart, while the husband remained unmoved,\r\nwas considered extremely touching. The President, having inquired of\r\nthe defence whether they desired to ask the witness any questions,\r\nthe advocates thanked him and answered No; while the prisoners, whose\r\ncountenances bore a doltish expression, followed Jacques with their\r\neyes, as he returned to his seat amidst the general sympathy of the\r\npublic.\r\n\r\nThe third day of the trial was entirely taken up by the address of\r\nthe Imperial Procurator, and the pleadings of the advocates on behalf\r\nof the accused. First of all the President delivered his summing-up\r\nof the case, in the course of which, under an appearance of absolute\r\nimpartiality, the charge of the prosecution was aggravated. The\r\nImperial Procurator, who followed, did not seem to be in the enjoyment\r\nof all his powers. He usually displayed more conviction, a deeper\r\neloquence. This was attributed to the heat, which was really most\r\noppressive. The advocate from Paris, who pleaded for Cabuche, on the\r\ncontrary, afforded great pleasure without convincing his hearers; while\r\nthe eminent member of the Rouen bar, who defended Roubaud, also made\r\nthe most he could of a bad case. The Imperial Procurator, who felt\r\nfatigued, did not even reply.\r\n\r\nWhen the jury retired to their room it was only six o\'clock. Broad\r\ndaylight still entered the court by the six windows, and a final ray\r\nlit up the arms of the towns of Normandy, decorating the imposts. A\r\nloud sound of voices rose to the old gilded ceiling, and the swaying of\r\nan impatient crowd shook the iron grating that separated the reserved\r\nseats from the public standing up. But silence was restored as soon as\r\nthe jury returned. The verdict, which was guilty, admitted extenuating\r\ncircumstances; and the two men were sentenced to hard labour for life.\r\nThe result caused great surprise. The public streamed out of court in a\r\ntumult, and a few shrill whistles were heard as at the theatre.\r\n\r\nThat same evening throughout Rouen the sentence gave rise to endless\r\ncomments. According to general opinion, it was a blow for Madame\r\nBonnehon and the Lachesnayes. Nothing short of a death sentence, it\r\nappeared, would have satisfied the family; and adverse interests\r\nmust certainly have made themselves felt. People already spoke in an\r\nundertone of Madame Leboucq, three or four of whose faithful slaves\r\nwere on the jury. No doubt there had been nothing incorrect in the\r\nattitude of her husband as assessor; and yet an impression seemed to\r\nprevail, that neither M. Chaumette, the other assessor, nor even M.\r\nDesbazeilles, the President, felt themselves such absolute masters of\r\nthe proceedings as they would have wished.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was simply that the jury full of scruples, in according\r\nextenuating circumstances, had ceded to that uneasy feeling of doubt\r\nthat had for a moment swept through the room--the silent flight of\r\nmelancholy truth. After all, the case remained a triumph for M.\r\nDenizet, the examining-magistrate, whose masterpiece nothing could\r\nimpair. The family lost a good deal of sympathy when a rumour got\r\nabroad that M. de Lachesnayes, contrary to all idea of jurisprudence,\r\nspoke of bringing an action in revocation, in spite of the death of\r\nthe donee, to regain possession of La Croix-de-Maufras, which caused\r\nastonishment considering he was a judge.\r\n\r\nOn leaving the law courts, Jacques was joined by Philom\xc3\xa8ne, who had\r\nremained as witness, and who now took possession of him. He would only\r\nresume duty on the morrow, and he invited her to dinner at the inn near\r\nthe station, where he pretended he had passed the night of the crime.\r\nHe did not intend to sleep there, being absolutely obliged to return to\r\nParis by the 12.50 train in the morning.\r\n\r\n"What do you think," said she, as she proceeded on his arm towards the\r\ninn, "I could swear that I met one of our acquaintances just now! Yes,\r\nPecqueux, who told me, again and again the other day, that he would not\r\nput his foot in Rouen for the case. At one time I turned round, and a\r\nman, whose back only I could see, slipped into the middle of the crowd."\r\n\r\nThe driver, with a shrug of the shoulders, interrupted her:\r\n\r\n"Pecqueux is in Paris, on the spree," said he; "only too delighted at\r\nthe holiday that my absence from duty procures him."\r\n\r\n"That may be possible," she answered. "But, nevertheless, let us be on\r\nour guard, for he is a most abominable brute when he is in a rage."\r\n\r\nShe pressed against him, adding with a glance behind her:\r\n\r\n"And do you know the man who is following us?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," he replied. "Do not bother about him. Perhaps he wants to ask me\r\nsomething."\r\n\r\nIt was Misard, who had in fact been following them at a distance from\r\nthe Rue des Juifs. He had given his evidence in his usual drowsy\r\nmanner; and had remained hovering around Jacques, unable to make up his\r\nmind to put a question to him, which was visibly on his lips. When the\r\ncouple disappeared in the inn, he entered in his turn, and called for a\r\nglass of wine.\r\n\r\n"Hullo! Is that you, Misard?" exclaimed the driver. "And how are you\r\ngetting on with your new wife? All right?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes," grumbled the signalman. "Ah! the wretch, she took me in.\r\nEh? I told you about that when I was here on the last occasion."\r\n\r\nThis story amused Jacques immensely. The woman Ducloux, the former\r\nservant of dubious antecedents whom Misard had taken as gatekeeper, had\r\nsoon perceived, on noticing him rummaging in the corners, that he must\r\nbe searching for a hoard, hidden by the defunct; and to make him marry\r\nher, she had conceived the ingenious idea of giving him to understand\r\nby sudden reticences and little laughs that she had found it herself.\r\nFirst of all he was on the point of strangling her; then, reflecting\r\nthat the 1,000 frcs. would again escape him, if he were to suppress\r\nher like the other, before he had them, he became very flattering and\r\namiable. But she repelled him. She would not allow him to touch her.\r\nNo, no; when she became his wife he should have both her and the money.\r\nAnd when he had married her, she simply laughed at him, remarking that\r\nhe was a great stupid to believe everything that was told him. The\r\nbeauty of the whole business, was that when she heard all about it, she\r\ncaught the fever from him, and henceforth sought for the money in his\r\ncompany, being quite as much enraged as himself to find it. Ah! those\r\nundiscoverable 1,000 frcs., they would certainly ferret them out one of\r\nthese days, now that they were two! And they sought, sought.\r\n\r\n"So you have no news?" inquired Jacques, in a bantering tone. "But does\r\nnot Ducloux assist you?"\r\n\r\nMisard fixed his eyes on him, and at last said what he had been wanting\r\nto say.\r\n\r\n"If you know where they are," he exclaimed, "tell me."\r\n\r\nBut the driver became angry.\r\n\r\n"I know nothing at all," he replied. "Aunt Phasie did not give me\r\nanything. You do not mean to accuse me of stealing, I suppose?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! She gave you nothing that is certain," he answered. "You see I am\r\nill, and if you know where they are, tell me."\r\n\r\n"Go to blazes!" retorted Jacques; "and mind I do not say too much. Just\r\ntake a look in the salt-box to see if they are there."\r\n\r\nMisard continued looking at him with pallid face and burning eyes. Then\r\ncame a sudden flash of enlightenment.\r\n\r\n"In the salt-box?" he remarked. "By Jove that is an idea! Underneath\r\nthe drawer there is a place where I have not looked."\r\n\r\nHastily settling for his glass of wine, he ran off to the railway\r\nstation, to see if he could catch the 7.10 train. And yonder in the\r\nlittle low habitation he sought eternally.\r\n\r\nIn the evening after dinner, while waiting for the 12.50 train,\r\nPhilom\xc3\xa8ne insisted on taking Jacques for a walk down the dark alleys,\r\nand out into the adjoining country. The atmosphere was extremely\r\nheavy--a hot, moonless July night, that filled her bosom with heavy\r\nsighs. On two occasions she fancied she heard footsteps behind them,\r\nbut on turning round could perceive no one, owing to the dense\r\nobscurity.\r\n\r\nJacques suffered considerably from this oppressive heat.\r\nNotwithstanding his tranquil equilibrium of mind and the perfect\r\nhealth that he enjoyed since the murder, he had just experienced\r\nat table a return of that distant uneasiness, each time that this\r\nwoman grazed him with her wandering hands. This was no doubt due to\r\nfatigue, to enervation caused by the heavy atmosphere. The anguish now\r\nreturned more keenly and was full of secret terror. And yet was he\r\nnot thoroughly cured? Nevertheless, his excitement became such that\r\nin dread of an attack, he would have disengaged his arm had not the\r\ndarkness surrounding him removed his fears; for never, even on days\r\nwhen he felt the effects of his complaint the most sharply, would he\r\nhave struck without seeing. All at once, as they came to a grassy slope\r\nbeside a solitary pathway and sat down, the monstrous craving began\r\nagain. He flew into a fit of madness, and at first searched in the\r\ngrass for a weapon, for a stone, to smash her head. Then he sprang to\r\nhis feet, and was already fleeing in distraction, when he heard a male\r\nvoice uttering oaths, and making a great disturbance.\r\n\r\n"Ah! you strumpet!" shouted Pecqueux. "I have waited to the end; I\r\nwanted to make sure!"\r\n\r\n"It is false," answered Philom\xc3\xa8ne. "Let me go!"\r\n\r\n"Ah! It is false!" said Pecqueux. "He may run, the other one. I know\r\nwho he is, and shall be able to come up with him. Look there, dare to\r\nsay again that it is not true!"\r\n\r\nJacques tore along in the darkness, not fleeing from Pecqueux whom he\r\nhad just recognised, but running away from himself, mad with grief.\r\n\r\nEh! what! one murder had not sufficed! He was not satiated with the\r\nblood of S\xc3\xa9verine as he had thought, even in the morning. He was now\r\nbeginning again. Another, and then another, and then still another! A\r\nfew weeks of torpor after being thoroughly gorged, and his frightful\r\ncraving returned. He required the flesh of women then, without end,\r\nto satisfy him. It was now no longer necessary to set eyes on this\r\nelement of seduction, the mere sensation of feeling the glow of a\r\nwoman sufficed. This put a stop to all enjoyment in life. Before him\r\nwas nothing but the dark night, through which he fled, and boundless\r\ndespair.\r\n\r\nA few days passed, Jacques had resumed his duty, avoiding his comrades,\r\nrelapsing into his former anxious unsociableness. War had just been\r\ndeclared after some stormy scenes in the Chamber; and there had already\r\nbeen a little fight at the outposts, attended by a satisfactory result\r\nit was said. For a week past, the departure of troops had overwhelmed\r\nthe servants of the railway companies with fatigue. The regular\r\nservice had become upset through the long delays occasioned by the\r\nfrequent extra trains; without counting that the best drivers had been\r\nrequisitioned to hasten the concentration of troops. And it was thus\r\nthat Jacques, one night at Havre, had to drive an enormously long train\r\nof eighteen trucks absolutely crammed with soldiers, instead of his\r\nusual express.\r\n\r\nOn that night, Pecqueux arrived at the dep\xc3\xb4t very drunk. The day after\r\nhe had surprised Philom\xc3\xa8ne and Jacques, he had accompanied the latter\r\non the engine 608 as fireman; and since then, although he made no\r\nallusion to the matter, he was gloomy and seemed as if he dared not\r\nlook his chief in the face. But the latter found him more and more\r\nrebellious, refusing to obey, and greeting every order he received with\r\na surly growl. As a result, they had entirely ceased speaking to one\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nThis moving plate, this little bridge which formerly bore them along\r\nin unity, was naught at this hour but the narrow, dangerous platform\r\non which their rivalry clashed. The hatred was increasing, they were\r\non the verge of devouring one another on these few square feet as\r\nthey flew onward full speed, and from which the slightest shock would\r\nprecipitate them. On this particular night, Jacques, seeing Pecqueux\r\ndrunk, felt distrustful; for he knew him to be too artful to get angry\r\nwhen sober; wine alone released the inner brute.\r\n\r\nThe train which should have left at six o\'clock was delayed. It was\r\nalready dark when they entrained the soldiers into cattle-trucks like\r\nsheep. Planks had simply been nailed across the vehicles in form of\r\nbenches, and the men were packed there by squads, cramming the trucks\r\nbeyond measure; so that while some were seated one upon another a\r\nfew stood up, so jammed together that they could not move a limb.\r\nOn reaching Paris another train was in readiness to take them to the\r\nRhine. They were already weighed down with fatigue in the confusion\r\nof departure. But as brandy had been distributed among them, and many\r\nhad visited drinking-places in the vicinity of the station, they were\r\nfull of heated and brutal gaiety, very red in the face, and with eyes\r\nstarting from their heads. As soon as the train moved out of the\r\nstation, they began to sing.\r\n\r\nJacques immediately gazed at the sky, where storm-clouds hid the\r\nstars. The night would be very dark, not a breath of wind stirred the\r\nburning air, and the wind of the advance, generally so fresh, proved\r\ntepid. In the sombre outlook ahead, appeared no other lights than the\r\nbright sparks of the signals. He increased the pressure to ascend the\r\nlong slope from Harfleur to Saint Romain. In spite of the study he\r\nhad made of the engine No. 608 for some weeks, he had not yet got it\r\nperfectly in hand. It was too new, and its caprice, its errors of youth\r\nastonished him.\r\n\r\nOn that night the locomotive proved particularly restive, whimsical,\r\nready to fly away if only a few more pieces of coal than necessary,\r\nwere placed on the bars. And so, with his hand on the reversing-wheel,\r\nhe watched the fire, becoming more and more anxious at the behaviour\r\nof his fireman. The small lamp, lighting the water-level in the\r\ngauge-glass, left the foot-plate in a penumbra, which the red-hot\r\ndoor of the fire-box rendered violescent. He distinguished Pecqueux\r\nindistinctly, but on two occasions he had felt a sensation in the legs\r\nlike the graze of fingers being exercised to grip him there. Doubtless\r\nthis was nothing more than the clumsiness of a drunkard, for above the\r\nriot of the train he could hear Pecqueux sneering very loudly, breaking\r\nhis coal with exaggerated blows of the hammer, and knocking with his\r\nshovel. Each minute he opened the door of the fire-box, flinging fuel\r\non the bars in unreasonable quantities.\r\n\r\n"Enough!" shouted Jacques.\r\n\r\nThe other, pretending not to understand, continued throwing in shovel\r\nupon shovel of coal; and as the driver grasped him by the arm, he\r\nturned round threateningly, having at last brought on the quarrel he\r\nhad been seeking, in the increasing fury of his drunkenness.\r\n\r\n"If you touch me I shall strike!" yelled Pecqueux. "It amuses me to go\r\nquick!"\r\n\r\nThe train was now rolling along full speed across the plain from Bolbec\r\nto Motteville, and was to go at one stretch to Paris without stopping,\r\nsave at the places indicated to take in water. The enormous mass, the\r\neighteen trucks loaded, crammed with human cattle, crossed the dark\r\ncountry in a ceaseless roar; and these men who were being carted along\r\nto be massacred sang, sang at the pitch of their voices, making such a\r\nclamour that it could be heard above the riot of the wheels.\r\n\r\nJacques closed the door of the fire-box with his foot. Then, man\xc5\x93uvring\r\nthe injector, he still restrained himself.\r\n\r\n"There is too big a fire," said he. "Go to sleep if you are drunk!"\r\n\r\nPecqueux immediately opened the door again, and obstinately threw on\r\nmore coal, as if he wanted to blow up the engine. This was rebellion,\r\norders disregarded, exasperated passion that took no further heed of\r\nall these human lives. And Jacques, having leant over to lower the\r\nrod of the ash-pan himself, so as to at least lessen the draught, the\r\nfireman abruptly caught him round the body, and tried to push him, to\r\nthrow him on the line with a violent jerk.\r\n\r\n"You blackguard!" exclaimed Jacques. "So that is your game, is it? And\r\nthen you would say that I tumbled over! You artful brute!"\r\n\r\nHe clung to the side of the tender, and both slid down. The struggle\r\ncontinued on the little iron-bridge, which danced violently. They\r\nceased speaking, and with set teeth each did his utmost to precipitate\r\nthe other through the narrow opening at the side which was only closed\r\nby an iron bar. But this did not prove easy. The devouring engine\r\nrolled on, and still rolled on. Barentin was passed, the train plunged\r\ninto the tunnel of Malaunay, and they continued to hold each other\r\ntightly, grovelling in the coal, striking their heads against the side\r\nof the water-tank, but avoiding the red-hot door of the fire-box, which\r\nscorched their legs each time they extended them.\r\n\r\nAt one moment, Jacques reflected that if he could raise himself he\r\nwould close the regulator, and call for assistance, so that he might be\r\nfreed of this furious madman, raging with drink and jealousy. Smaller\r\nin build than Pecqueux, he was becoming weak, and now despaired of\r\nfinding sufficient strength to fling his aggressor from the locomotive.\r\nIndeed, he was already vanquished, and felt the terror of the fall pass\r\nthrough his hair. As in a supreme effort, he groped about with his\r\nhand, the other understood, and, stiffening his loins, raised him like\r\na child.\r\n\r\n"Ah! You want to stop! Ah! you took my girl! Hah! hah! You will have to\r\ngo over the side!"\r\n\r\nThe engine rolled onward, onward. The train issued from the tunnel\r\nwith a great crash, and continued its course through the barren,\r\nsombre country. Malaunay station was passed in such a tempestuous\r\nblast that the assistant station-master, standing on the platform, did\r\nnot even see the two men endeavouring to slaughter one another as the\r\nthunderbolt bore them away.\r\n\r\nAt last, Pecqueux with a final spurt, precipitated Jacques from the\r\nengine; but the latter, feeling himself in space, clung so tightly\r\nin his bewilderment to the neck of his antagonist, that he dragged\r\nPecqueux along with him. There were a couple of terrible shrieks, which\r\nmingled one with the other and were lost. The two men falling together,\r\ncast under the wheels by the counter shock, were cut to pieces clasping\r\none another in that frightful embrace--they, who so long had lived as\r\nbrothers. They were found without heads, and without feet, two bleeding\r\ntrunks, still hugging as if to choke each other.\r\n\r\nAnd the engine, free from all guidance rolled on and on. At last the\r\nrestive, whimsical thing could give way to the transports of youth, and\r\ngallop across the even country like some unbroken filly escaped from\r\nthe hands of its groom. The boiler was full of water, the coal which\r\nhad just been renewed in the fire-box, was aglow; and during the first\r\nhalf-hour the pressure went up tremendously, while the speed became\r\nfrightful. Probably the headguard, overcome with fatigue, had fallen\r\nasleep. The soldiers, whose intoxication increased through being packed\r\nso closely together, suddenly became amused at this rapid flight of the\r\ntrain, and sang the louder. Maromme was passed in a flash. The whistle\r\nno longer sounded as the signals were approached, and the stations\r\nreached. This was the straight gallop of an animal charging, head down\r\nand silent, amidst the obstacles. And it rolled on and on without end,\r\nas if maddened more and more by the strident sound of its breath.\r\n\r\nAt Rouen the engine should have taken in water; and the people at the\r\nstation were struck with terror when they saw this mad train dart by in\r\na whirl of smoke and flame; the locomotive without driver or fireman,\r\nthe cattle-trucks full of soldiers yelling patriotic songs. They were\r\ngoing to the war, and if the train did not stop it was in order that\r\nthey might arrive more rapidly yonder, on the banks of the Rhine.\r\nThe railway servants stood gaping, agitating their arms. Immediately\r\nthere was one general cry, this train let loose, abandoned to itself,\r\nwould never pass without impediment through Sotteville station, which\r\nwas always blocked by shunting man\xc5\x93uvres and obstructed by carriages\r\nand engines like all great dep\xc3\xb4ts. And there was a rush to the\r\ntelegraph-office to give warning.\r\n\r\nAt Sotteville a goods train, occupying the line, was shunted just\r\nin time. Already the rumble of the escaped monster could be heard in\r\nthe distance. It had dashed into the two tunnels in the vicinity of\r\nRouen, and was arriving at its furious gallop like a prodigious and\r\nirresistible force that naught could now stay; and Sotteville station\r\nwas left behind. It passed among the obstacles without touching\r\nanything, and again plunged into the obscurity where its roar gradually\r\ndied away.\r\n\r\nBut now, all the telegraphic apparatus on the line was tinkling, all\r\nhearts were beating at the news of the phantom train which had just\r\nbeen seen passing through Rouen and Sotteville. Everyone trembled with\r\nfear, an express on ahead would certainly be caught up. The runaway,\r\nlike a wild boar in the underwood, continued its course without giving\r\nany attention either to red lights or crackers. It almost ran into a\r\npilot-engine at Oissel and terrified Pont-de-l\'Arche, for its speed\r\nshowed no signs of slackening. Again it had disappeared, and it rolled\r\non and on in the obscure night, going none knew where--yonder.\r\n\r\nWhat mattered the victims the engine crushed on the road! Was it not\r\nadvancing towards the future in spite of all, heedless of the blood\r\nthat might be spilt? Without a guide, amidst the darkness, like an\r\nanimal blind and dumb let loose amidst death, it rolled on and on,\r\nloaded with this food for cannon, with these soldiers already besotted\r\nwith fatigue and drink, who were singing.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Monomaniac, by \xc3\x89mile Zola\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE MONOMANIAC ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 57038-0.txt or 57038-0.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/7/0/3/57038/\r\n\r\nProduced by Clare Graham & Marc D\'Hooghe at Free Literature\r\n(Images generously made available by the Internet Archive.)\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\r\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n'
