There is\r\nno trade in the town, properly so called. To be sure, there are two or\r\nthree small counting-houses at the other end of George Street, in that\r\nambitious pile called Gresham Chambers; but the owners of these places\r\nof business live, as a general rule, in villas, either detached or\r\nsemi-detached, in the North-end, the new quarter, which, as everybody\r\nknows, is a region totally unrepresented in society. In Carlingford\r\nproper there is no trade, no manufactures, no anything in particular,\r\nexcept very pleasant parties and a superior class of people--a very\r\nsuperior class of people, indeed, to anything one expects to meet\r\nwith in a country town, which is not even a county town, nor the seat\r\nof any particular interest. It is the boast of the place that it has no\r\nparticular interest--not even a public school: for no reason in the\r\nworld but because they like it, have so many nice people collected\r\ntogether in those pretty houses in Grange Lane--which is, of course, a\r\nvery much higher tribute to the town than if any special inducement had\r\nled them there. But in every community some centre of life is necessary.\r\nThis point, round which everything circles, is, in Carlingford, found in\r\nthe clergy. They are the administrators of the commonwealth, the only\r\npeople who have defined and compulsory duties to give a sharp outline to\r\nlife. Somehow this touch of necessity and business seems needful even\r\nin the most refined society: a man who is obliged to be somewhere at a\r\ncertain hour, to do something at a certain time, and whose public duties\r\nare not volunteer proceedings, but indispensable work, has a certain\r\nposition of command among a leisurely and unoccupied community, not to\r\nsay that it is a public boon to have some one whom everybody knows and\r\ncan talk of. The minister in Salem Chapel was everything in his little\r\nworld. That respectable connection would not have hung together half so\r\nclosely but for this perpetual subject of discussion, criticism, and\r\npatronage; and, to compare great things with small, society in Carlingford\r\nrecognised in some degree the same human want. An enterprising or\r\nnon-enterprising rector made all the difference in the world in Grange\r\nLane; and in the absence of a rector that counted for anything (and poor\r\nMr Proctor was of no earthly use, as everybody knows), it followed, as a\r\nnatural consequence, that a great deal of the interest and influence of\r\nthe position fell into the hands of the Curate of St Roque\'s.\r\n\r\nBut that position was one full of difficulties, as any one acquainted\r\nwith the real state of affairs must see in a moment. Mr Wentworth\'s\r\ncircumstances were, on the whole, as delicate and critical as can be\r\nimagined, both as respected his standing in Carlingford and the place\r\nhe held in his own family--not to speak of certain other personal\r\nmatters which were still more troublesome and vexatious. These last of\r\ncourse were of his own bringing on; for if a young man chooses to fall\r\nin love when he has next to nothing to live upon, trouble is sure to\r\nfollow. He had quite enough on his hands otherwise without that\r\ncrowning complication. When Mr Wentworth first came to Carlingford,\r\nit was in the days of Mr Bury, the Evangelical rector--his last\r\ndays, when he had no longer his old vigour, and was very glad of\r\n"assistance," as he said, in his public and parish work. Mr Bury had a\r\nfriendship of old standing with the Miss Wentworths of Skelmersdale,\r\nMr Francis Wentworth\'s aunts; and it was a long time before the old\r\nRector\'s eyes were opened to the astounding fact, that the nephew of\r\nthese precious and chosen women held "views" of the most dangerous\r\ncomplexion, and indeed was as near Rome as a strong and lofty\r\nconviction of the really superior catholicity of the Anglican Church\r\nwould permit him to be. Before he found this out, Mr Bury, who had\r\nunlimited confidence in preaching and improving talk, had done all he\r\ncould to get the young man to "work," as the good Rector called it,\r\nand had voluntarily placed all that difficult district about the canal\r\nunder the charge of the Curate of St Roque\'s. It is said that the\r\nhorror with which, after having just written to Miss Leonora Wentworth\r\nto inform her what "a great work" his young friend was doing among the\r\nbargemen, Mr Bury was seized upon entering St Roque\'s itself for the\r\nfirst time after the consecration, when the young priest had arranged\r\neverything his own way, had a very bad effect on his health, and\r\nhastened his end. And it is indeed a fact that he died soon after,\r\nbefore he had time to issue the interdict he intended against Mr\r\nWentworth\'s further exertions in the parish of Carlingford. Then came\r\nMr Proctor, who came into the town as if he had dropped from the\r\nskies, and knew no more about managing a parish than a baby; and\r\nunder his exceptional incumbency Mr Wentworth became more than ever\r\nnecessary to the peace of the community. Now a new _r\xe9gime_ had been\r\ninaugurated. Mr Morgan, a man whom Miss Wodehouse described as "in the\r\nprime of life," newly married, with a wife also in the prime of life,\r\nwho had waited for him ten years, and all that time had been under\r\ntraining for her future duties--two fresh, new, active, clergymanly\r\nintellects, entirely open to the affairs of the town, and intent\r\nupon general reformation and sound management--had just come into\r\npossession. The new Rector was making a great stir all about him, as\r\nwas natural to a new man; and it seemed, on the whole, a highly\r\ndoubtful business whether he and Mr Wentworth would find Carlingford\r\nbig enough to hold them both.\r\n\r\n"We could not have expected to begin quite without difficulties," said\r\nMrs Morgan, as she and her husband discussed the question in the\r\ndrawing-room of the Rectory. It was a pretty drawing-room, though Mr\r\nProctor\'s taste was not quite in accordance with the principles of\r\nthe new incumbent\'s wife: however, as the furniture was all new, and as\r\nthe former rector had no further need for it, it was of course, much the\r\nbest and most economical arrangement to take it as it stood--though the\r\nbouquets on the carpet were a grievance which nothing but her high\r\nChristian principles could have carried Mrs Morgan through. She looked\r\nround as she spoke, and gave an almost imperceptible shake of her head:\r\nshe, too, had her share of disagreeables. "It would not look like\r\nChrist\'s work, dear," said the clergyman\'s wife, "if we had it all our\r\nown way."\r\n\r\n"My dear, I hope I am actuated by higher motives than a desire to have\r\nit all my own way," said the Rector. "I always felt sure that Proctor\r\nwould make a mess of any parish he took in hand, but I did not imagine\r\nhe would have left it to anybody who pleased to work it. You may\r\nimagine what my feelings were to-day, when I came upon a kind of\r\nimpromptu chapel in that wretched district near the canal. I thought\r\nit a Little Bethel, you know, of course; but instead of that, I find\r\nyoung Wentworth goes there Wednesdays and Fridays to do duty, and that\r\nthere is service on Sunday evening, and I can\'t tell what besides.\r\nIt may be done from a good motive--but such a disregard of all\r\nconstituted authority," said the Rector, with involuntary vehemence,\r\n"can never, in my opinion, be attended by good results."\r\n\r\n"Mr Wentworth, did you say?" said Mrs Morgan, upon whose female soul\r\nthe Perpetual Curate\'s good looks and good manners had not been\r\nwithout a certain softening effect. "I am so sorry. I don\'t wonder you\r\nare vexed; but don\'t you think there must be some mistake, William? Mr\r\nWentworth is so gentlemanly and nice--and of very good family, too.\r\nI don\'t think he would choose to set himself in opposition to the\r\nRector. I think there must be some mistake." "It\'s a very aggravating\r\nmistake, at all events," said Mr Morgan, rising and going to the\r\nwindow. It was, as we have said, a very pretty drawing-room, and the\r\nwindows opened upon as pretty a bit of lawn as you could see, with one\r\nhandsome cedar sweeping its dark branches majestically over delicious\r\ngreensward; but some people did think it was too near George Street\r\nand the railway. Just at that moment a puff of delicate white vapour\r\nappeared over the wall, and a sudden express-train, just released from\r\nthe cover of the station, sprang with a snort and bound across the\r\nRector\'s view, very imperfectly veiled by the lime-trees, which were\r\nthin in their foliage as yet. Mr Morgan groaned and retreated--out of\r\nhis first exaltation he had descended all at once, as people will do\r\nafter building all their hopes upon one grand event, into great\r\ndepression and vexation, when he found that, after all, this event did\r\nnot change the face of existence, but indeed brought new proofs of\r\nmortality in the shape of special annoyances belonging to itself in\r\nits train. "On the whole," said the Rector, who was subject to fits of\r\ndisgust with things in general, "I am tempted to think it was a\r\nmistake coming to Carlingford; the drawbacks quite overbalance the\r\nadvantages. I did hesitate, I remember--it must have been my better\r\nangel: that is, my dear," he continued, recollecting himself, "I would\r\nhave hesitated had it not been for you."\r\n\r\nHere there ensued a little pause. Mrs Morgan was not so young as she\r\nhad been ten years ago, all which time she had waited patiently for\r\nthe Fellow of All-Souls, and naturally these ten years and the\r\npatience had not improved her looks. There was a redness on her\r\ncountenance nowadays which was not exactly bloom; and it stretched\r\nacross her cheeks, and over the point of her nose, as she was\r\npainfully aware, poor lady. She was silent when she heard this,\r\nwondering with a passing pang whether he was sorry? But being a\r\nthoroughly sensible woman, and above indulging in those little appeals\r\nby which foolish ones confuse the calm of matrimonial friendship, she\r\ndid not express the momentary feeling. "Yes, William," she said,\r\nsympathetically, casting her eyes again on the objectionable carpet,\r\nand feeling that there _were_ drawbacks even to her happiness as the\r\nwife of the Rector of Carlingford; "but I suppose every place has its\r\ndisadvantages; and then there is such good society; and a town like\r\nthis is the very place for your talents; and when affairs are in your\r\nown hands--"\r\n\r\n"It is very easy talking," said the vexed Rector. "Society and\r\neverybody would turn upon me if I interfered with Wentworth--there\'s\r\nthe vexation. The fellow goes about it as if he had a right. Why,\r\nthere\'s a Provident Society and all sorts of things going on, exactly\r\nas if it were his own parish. What led me to the place was seeing\r\nsome ladies in grey cloaks--exactly such frights as you used to make\r\nyourself, my dear--flickering about. He has got up a sisterhood, I\r\nhave no doubt; and to find all this in full operation in one\'s own\r\nparish, without so much as being informed of it! and you know I don\'t\r\napprove of sisterhoods--never did; they are founded on a mistake."\r\n\r\n"Yes, dear. I know I gave up as soon as I knew your views on that\r\nsubject," said Mrs Morgan. "I daresay so will the ladies here. Who\r\nwere they? Did you speak to them? or perhaps they belonged to St\r\nRoque\'s."\r\n\r\n"Nobody belongs to St Roque\'s," said the Rector, contemptuously--"it\r\nhas not even a district. They were the two Miss Wodehouses."\r\n\r\nMrs Morgan was moved to utter a little cry. "And their father is\r\nchurchwarden!" said the indignant woman. "Really, William, this is too\r\nmuch--without even consulting you! But it is easy to see how _that_\r\ncomes about. Lucy Wodehouse and young Wentworth are--; well, I don\'t\r\nknow if they are engaged--but they are always together, walking and\r\ntalking, and consulting with each other, and so forth--a great deal\r\nmore than I could approve of; but that poor elder sister, you know,\r\nhas no authority--nor indeed any experience, poor thing," said the\r\nRector\'s wife; "that\'s how it is, no doubt." "Engaged!" said the\r\nRector. He gave a kindly glance at his wife, and melted a little.\r\n"Engaged, are they? Poor little thing! I hope she\'ll be as good as you\r\nhave been, my dear; but a young man may be in love without interfering\r\nwith another man\'s parish. I can\'t forgive that," said Mr Morgan,\r\nrecovering himself; "he must be taught to know better; and it is very\r\nhard upon a clergyman," continued the spiritual ruler of Carlingford,\r\n"that he cannot move in a matter like this without incurring a storm\r\nof godless criticism. If I were sending Wentworth out of my parish, I\r\nshouldn\'t wonder if the \'Times\' had an article upon it, denouncing me\r\nas an indolent priest and bigot, that would neither work myself nor\r\nlet my betters work; that\'s how these fellows talk."\r\n\r\n"But nobody could say such things of you," said Mrs Morgan, firing up.\r\n\r\n"Of me! they\'d say them of St Paul, if he had ever been in the\r\ncircumstances," said the Rector; "and I should just like to know what\r\nhe would have done in a parish like this, with the Dissenters on one\r\nside, and a Perpetual Curate without a district meddling on the other.\r\nAh, my dear," continued Mr Morgan, "I daresay they had their troubles\r\nin those days; but facing a governor or so now and then, or even\r\npassing a night in the stocks, is a very different thing from a\r\nshowing-up in the \'Times,\' not to speak of the complications of duty.\r\nLet us go out and call at Folgate\'s, and see whether he thinks\r\nanything can be done to the church."\r\n\r\n"Dear, you wouldn\'t mind the \'Times\' if it were your duty?" said the\r\nRector\'s wife, getting up promptly to prepare for the walk.\r\n\r\n"No, I suppose not," said Mr Morgan, not without a thrill of importance;\r\n"nor the stake," he added, with a little laugh, for he was not without a\r\nsense of humour; and the two went out to the architect\'s to ascertain\r\nthe result of his cogitations over the church. They passed that sacred\r\nedifice in their way, and went in to gaze at it with a disgust which\r\nonly an unhappy priest of high culture and aesthetic tastes, doomed to\r\nofficiate in a building of the eighteenth century, of the churchwarden\r\nperiod of architecture, could fully enter into. "Eugh!" said Mr Morgan,\r\nlooking round upon the high pews and stifling galleries with an expressive\r\ncontraction of his features--his wife looked on sympathetic; and it was\r\nat this unlucky moment that the subject of their late conference made\r\nhis appearance cheerfully from behind the ugly pulpit, in close\r\nconference with Mr Folgate. The pulpit was a three-storeyed mass, with\r\nthe reading-desk and the clerk\'s desk beneath--a terrible eyesore to the\r\nRector and his wife.\r\n\r\n"I can fancy the expediency of keeping the place in repair," said the\r\nCurate of St Roque\'s, happy in the consciousness of possessing a\r\nchurch which, though not old, had been built by Gilbert Scott, and\r\ncheerfully unconscious of the presence of his listeners; "but to\r\nbeautify a wretched old barn like this is beyond the imagination of\r\nman. Money can\'t do everything," said the heedless young man as he\r\ncame lounging down the middle aisle, tapping contemptuously with his\r\ncane upon the high pew-doors. "I wonder where the people expected to\r\ngo to who built Carlingford Church? Curious," continued the young\r\nAnglican, stopping in mid career, "to think of bestowing _consecration_\r\nupon anything so hideous. What a pass the world must have come to,\r\nFolgate, when this erection was counted worthy to be the house of God!\r\nAfter all, perhaps it is wrong to feel so strongly about it. The walls\r\n_are_ consecrated, though they are ugly; we can\'t revoke the blessing.\r\nBut no wonder it was an unchristian age."\r\n\r\n"We have our treasure in earthen vessels," said Mr Morgan, somewhat\r\nsternly, from where he stood, under shelter of the heavy gallery. Mr\r\nWentworth was shortsighted, like most people nowadays. He put up his\r\nglass hastily, and then hurried forward, perhaps just a little\r\nabashed. When he had made his salutations, however, he returned\r\nundismayed to the charge.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a great pity you have not something better to work upon," said\r\nthe dauntless Curate; "but it is difficult to conceive what can be\r\ndone with such an unhallowed type of construction. I was just saying\r\nto Folgate--"\r\n\r\n"There is a great deal of cant abroad on this subject," said Mr\r\nMorgan, interrupting the young oracle. "I like good architecture, but\r\nI don\'t relish attributing moral qualities to bricks and mortar. The\r\nhallowing influence ought to be within. Mr Folgate, we were going to\r\ncall at your office. Have you thought of the little suggestions I\r\nventured to make? Oh, the drawings are here. Mr Wentworth does not\r\napprove of them, I suppose?" said the Rector, turning sternly round\r\nupon the unlucky Curate of St Roque\'s.\r\n\r\n"I can only say I sympathise with you profoundly," said young\r\nWentworth, with great seriousness. "Such a terrible church must be a\r\ngreat trial. I wish I had any advice worth offering; but it is my hour\r\nfor a short service down at the canal, and I can\'t keep my poor\r\nbargees waiting. Good morning. I hope you\'ll come and give us your\r\ncountenance, Mrs Morgan. There\'s no end of want and trouble at\r\nWharfside."\r\n\r\n"Is Mr Wentworth aware, I wonder, that Wharfside is in the parish of\r\nCarlingford?" said the Rector, with involuntary severity, as the young\r\npriest withdrew calmly to go to his "duty." Mr Folgate, who supposed\r\nhimself to be addressed, smiled, and said, "Oh yes, of course," and\r\nunfolded his drawings, to which the clerical pair before him lent a\r\ndisturbed attention. They were both in a high state of indignation by\r\nthis time. It seemed indispensable that something should be done to\r\nbring to his senses an intruder so perfectly composed and at his\r\nease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Mr Wentworth, without much thought of his sins, went down\r\nGeorge Street, meaning to turn off at the first narrow turning which\r\nled down behind the shops and traffic, behind the comfort and beauty\r\nof the little town, to that inevitable land of shadow which always\r\ndogs the sunshine. Carlingford proper knew little about it, except\r\nthat it increased the poor-rates, and now and then produced a fever.\r\nThe minister of Salem Chapel was in a state of complete ignorance on\r\nthe subject. The late Rector had been equally uninformed. Mr Bury, who\r\nwas Evangelical, had the credit of disinterring the buried creatures\r\nthere about thirty years ago. It was an office to be expected of that\r\nmuch-preaching man; but what was a great deal more extraordinary, was\r\nto find that the only people now in Carlingford who knew anything\r\nabout Wharfside, except overseers of the poor and guardians of the\r\npublic peace, were the Perpetual Curate of St Roque\'s--who had nothing\r\nparticular to do with it, and who was regarded by many sober-minded\r\npersons with suspicion as a dilettante Anglican, given over to floral\r\nornaments and ecclesiastical upholstery--and some half-dozen people of\r\nthe very _\xe9lite_ of society, principally ladies residing in Grange\r\nLane.\r\n\r\nMr Wentworth came to a hesitating pause at the head of the turning\r\nwhich would have led him to Wharfside. He looked at his watch and saw\r\nthere was half an hour to spare. He gave a wistful lingering look down\r\nthe long line of garden-walls, pausing upon one point where the\r\nblossomed boughs of an apple-tree overlooked that enclosure. There\r\nwas quite time to call and ask if the Miss Wodehouses were going down\r\nto the service this afternoon; but was it duty? or, indeed, putting\r\nthat question aside, was it quite right to compound matters with his\r\nown heart\'s desire and the work he was engaged in, in this undeniable\r\nfashion? The young priest crossed the street very slowly, swinging his\r\ncane and knitting his brows as he debated the question. If it had been\r\none of the bargemen bringing his sweetheart, walking with her along\r\nthe side of the canal to which Spring and sweet Easter coming on, and\r\nLove, perhaps, always helpful of illusions, might convey a certain\r\ngreenness and sentiment of nature--and echoing her soft responses to\r\nthe afternoon prayers--perhaps the Curate might have felt that such\r\ndevotion was not entirely pure and simple. But somehow, before he was\r\naware of it, his slow footstep had crossed the line, and he found\r\nhimself in Grange Lane, bending his steps towards Mr Wodehouse\'s door.\r\nFor one thing, to be sure, the Canticles in the evening service could\r\nalways be sung when Lucy\'s sweet clear voice was there to lead the\r\nuncertain melody; and it was good to see her singing the \'Magnificat\'\r\nwith that serious sweet face, "full of grace," like Mary\'s own.\r\nThinking of that, Mr Wentworth made his way without any further\r\nhesitation to the green door over which hung the apple-blossoms,\r\ntotally untroubled in his mind as to what the reverend pair were\r\nthinking whom he had left behind him in the ugly church; and\r\nunconscious that his impromptu chapel at Wharfside, with its little\r\ncarved reading-desk, and the table behind, contrived so as to look\r\nsuspiciously like an altar, was a thorn in anybody\'s side. Had his\r\nmind been in a fit condition at that moment to cogitate trouble, his\r\nthoughts would have travelled in a totally different direction, but in\r\nthe mean time Mr Wentworth was very well able to put aside his\r\nperplexities. The green door opened just as he reached it, and Lucy\r\nand her elder sister came out in those grey cloaks which the Rector\r\nhad slandered. They were just going to Wharfside to the service, and\r\nof course they were surprised to see Mr Wentworth, who did not knock\r\nat that green door more than a dozen times in a week, on the average.\r\nThe Curate walked between the sisters on their way towards their\r\nfavourite "district." Such a position would scarcely have been\r\notherwise than agreeable to any young man. Dear old Miss Wodehouse was\r\nthe gentlest of chaperones. Old Miss Wodehouse people called her, not\r\nknowing why--perhaps because that adjective was sweeter than the harsh\r\none of middle age which belonged to her; and then there was such a\r\ndifference between her and Lucy. Lucy was twenty, and in her sweetest\r\nbloom. Many people thought with Mr Wentworth that there were not other\r\ntwo such eyes in Carlingford. Not that they were brilliant or\r\npenetrating, but as blue as heaven, and as serene and pure. So many\r\npersons thought, and the Perpetual Curate among them. The grey cloak\r\nfell in pretty folds around that light elastic figure; and there was\r\nnot an old woman in the town so tender, so helpful, so handy as Lucy\r\nwhere trouble was, as all the poor people knew. So the three went down\r\nPrickett\'s Lane, which leads from George Street towards the canal--not\r\na pleasant part of the town by any means; and if Mr Wentworth was\r\nconscious of a certain haze of sunshine all round and about him,\r\ngliding over the poor pavement, and here and there transfiguring some\r\nbaby bystander gazing open-mouthed at the pretty lady, could any\r\nreasonable man be surprised?\r\n\r\n"I hope your aunts were quite well, Mr Wentworth, when you heard from\r\nthem last," said Miss Wodehouse, "and all your people at home. In such\r\na small family as ours, we should go out of our wits if we did not\r\nhear every day; but I suppose it is different where there are so many.\r\nLucy, when she goes from home," said the tender elder sister, glancing\r\nat her with a half-maternal admiration--"and she might always be\r\nvisiting about if she liked--writes to me every day."\r\n\r\n"I have nobody who cares for me enough to write every week," said the\r\nCurate, with a look which was for Lucy\'s benefit. "I am not so lucky\r\nas you. My aunts are quite well, Miss Wodehouse, and they think I had\r\nbetter go up to town in May for the meetings," added Mr Wentworth,\r\nwith a passing laugh; "and the rest of my people are very indignant\r\nthat I am not of their way of thinking. There is Tom Burrows on the\r\nother side of the street; he is trying to catch _your_ eye," said the\r\nCurate, turning round upon Lucy; for the young man had come to such a\r\npass that he could not address her in an ordinary and proper way like\r\nother people, but, because he dared not yet call her by her Christian\r\nname as if she belonged to him, had a strange rude way of indicating\r\nwhen he was speaking to her, by emphasis and action. It was singularly\r\ndifferent from his usual good-breeding; but Lucy somehow rather liked\r\nit than otherwise. "He is not going to church for the sake of the\r\nservice. He is going to please _you_. He has never forgotten what you\r\ndid for that little boy of his; and, indeed, if you continue to go on\r\nso," said Mr Wentworth, lowering his voice, and more than ever bending\r\nhis tall head to one side, "I shall have to put a stop to it somehow,\r\nfor I am not prepared, whatever people say, to go in at once for\r\n_public_ worship of the saints."\r\n\r\n"I am going in here to call," said Lucy. She looked up very innocently\r\nin the Curate\'s face. "I promised the poor sick woman in the back room\r\nto see her every day, and I could not get out any sooner. I daresay I\r\nshall be at the schoolroom before you begin. Good-bye just now," said\r\nthe young Sister of Mercy. She went off all at once on this provoking\r\nbut unexceptionable errand, looking with calm eyes upon the dismay\r\nwhich overspread the expressive countenance of her spiritual guide. Mr\r\nWentworth stood looking after her for a moment, stunned by the\r\nunexpected movement. When he went on, truth compels us to own that a\r\nthrill of disgust had taken the place of that vague general sense of\r\nbeatitude which threw beauty even upon Prickett\'s Lane. The Curate\r\ngave but a sulky nod to the salutation of Tom Burrows, and walked on\r\nin a savage mood by the side of Miss Wodehouse, around whom no nimbus\r\nof ideal glory hovered.\r\n\r\n"I am always afraid of its being too much for her, Mr Wentworth," said\r\nthe anxious elder sister; "it upsets me directly; but then I never was\r\nlike Lucy--I can\'t tell where all you young people have learned it; we\r\nnever used to be taught so in my day; and though I am twice as old as\r\nshe is, I know I am not half so much good in the world," said the kind\r\nsoul, with a gentle sigh. "I should like to see you in a parish of\r\nyour own, where you would have it all your own way. I hope Mr Morgan\r\nwon\'t be meddling when he comes to have time for everything. I should\r\nalmost think he would--though it seems unkind to say it--by his face."\r\n\r\n"I am doing nothing more than my duty," said the Perpetual Curate, in\r\nmorose tones. "This district was given into my hands by the late\r\nRector. Mr Morgan\'s face does not matter to me."\r\n\r\n"But I should like to see you in a parish of your own," said Miss\r\nWodehouse, meaning to please him. "You know papa always says so. St\r\nRoque\'s is very nice, but--"\r\n\r\n"If you wish me out of the way, Miss Wodehouse, I am sorry to say you\r\nare not likely to be gratified," said the Curate, "for I have no more\r\nexpectation of any preferment than you have. Such chances don\'t come\r\nin everybody\'s way."\r\n\r\n"But I thought your aunts, Mr Wentworth--" said poor Miss Wodehouse,\r\nwho unluckily did not always know when to stop.\r\n\r\n"My aunts don\'t approve of my principles," answered Mr Wentworth, who\r\nhad his own reasons for speaking with a little asperity. "They are\r\nmore likely to have me denounced at Exeter Hall. I will join you\r\nimmediately. I must speak to these men across the street;" and the\r\nCurate accordingly walked into a knot of loungers opposite, with a\r\ndecision of manner which Lucy\'s desertion had helped him to. Miss\r\nWodehouse, thus left alone, went on with lingering and somewhat doubtful\r\nsteps. She was not used to being in "the district" by herself. It\r\ndisturbed her mild, middle-aged habits to be left straying about here\r\nalone among all these poor people, whom she looked at half wistfully,\r\nhalf alarmed, feeling for them in her kind heart, but not at all knowing\r\nhow to get at them as the young people did. The unruly children and\r\ngossiping mothers at the poor doors discomposed her sadly, and she was\r\nnot near so sure that her grey cloak defended her from all rudeness as\r\nshe pretended to be when assenting to the enthusiasm of Mr Wentworth and\r\nLucy. She made tremulous haste to get out of this scene, which she was\r\nnot adapted for, to the shelter of the schoolroom, where, at least, she\r\nwould be safe. "We never were taught so in my day," she said to herself,\r\nwith an unexpressed wonder which was right; but when she had reached\r\nthat haven of shelter, was seized with a little panic for Lucy, and went\r\nout again and watched for her at the corner of the street, feeling very\r\nuncomfortable. It was a great relief to see her young sister coming down\r\nalert and bright even before she was joined by Mr Wentworth, who had\r\ncarried his point with the men he had been talking to. To see them\r\ncoming down together, smiling to all those people at the doors who\r\ndisturbed the gentle mind of Miss Wodehouse with mingled sentiments of\r\nsympathy and repulsion, bestowing nods of greeting here and there,\r\npausing even to say a word to a few favoured clients, was a wonderful\r\nsight to the timid maiden lady at the corner of the street. Twenty years\r\nago some such companion might have been by Miss Wodehouse\'s side, but\r\nnever among the poor people in Prickett\'s Lane. Even with Lucy before\r\nher she did not understand it. As the two came towards her, other\r\nthoughts united with these in her kind soul. "I wonder whether anything\r\nwill ever come of it?" she said to herself, and with that wandered into\r\nanxious reflections what this difference could be between Mr Wentworth\r\nand his aunts: which cogitations, indeed, occupied her till the service\r\nbegan, and perhaps disturbed her due appreciation of it; for if Lucy and\r\nMr Wentworth got attached, as seemed likely, and Mr Wentworth did not\r\nget a living, what was to come of it? The thought made this\r\ntender-hearted spectator sigh: perhaps she had some experience of her\r\nown to enlighten her on such a point. At least it troubled, with\r\nsympathetic human cares, the gentle soul which had lost the confidence\r\nof youth.\r\n\r\nAs for the two most immediately concerned, they thought nothing at all\r\nabout aunts or livings. Whether it is the divine influence of youth,\r\nor whether the vague unacknowledged love which makes two people happy\r\nin each other\'s presence carries with it a certain inspiration, this\r\nat least is certain, that there is an absolute warmth of devotion\r\narrived at in such moments, which many a soul, no longer happy, would\r\ngive all the world to reach. Such crowds and heaps of blessings fall\r\nto these young souls! They said their prayers with all their hearts,\r\nnot aware of deriving anything of that profound sweet trust and\r\nhappiness from each other, but expanding over all the rude but\r\nreverend worshippers around them, with an unlimited faith in their\r\nimprovement, almost in their perfection. This was what the wondering\r\nlooker-on, scarcely able to keep her anxieties out of her prayers,\r\ncould not understand, having forgotten, though she did not think so,\r\nthe exaltation of that time of youth, as people do. She thought it all\r\ntheir goodness that they were able to put away their own thoughts; she\r\ndid not know it was in the very nature of those unexpressed emotions\r\nto add the confidence of happiness to their prayers.\r\n\r\nAnd after a while they all separated and went away back into the world\r\nand the everyday hours. Young Wentworth and Lucy had not said a syllable\r\nto each other, except about the people in "the district," and the\r\nProvident Society; and how that sober and laudable conversation could be\r\ncalled love-making, it would be difficult for the most ardent imagination\r\nto conceive. He was to dine with them that evening; so it was for but a\r\nvery brief time that they parted when the Perpetual Curate left the\r\nladies at the green door, and went away to his room, to attend to some\r\nother duties, before he arrayed himself for the evening. As for the\r\nsisters, they went in quite comfortably, and had their cup of tea before\r\nthey dressed for dinner. Lucy was manager indoors as well as out. She\r\nwas good for a great deal more than Miss Wodehouse in every practical\r\nmatter. It was she who was responsible for the dinner, and had all the\r\ncares of the house upon her head. Notwithstanding, the elder sister took\r\nup her prerogative as they sat together in two very cosy easy-chairs,\r\nin a little room which communicated with both their bed-chambers\r\nup-stairs--a very cosy little odd room, not a dressing-room nor a\r\nboudoir, but something between the two, where the sisters had their\r\nprivate talks upon occasion, and which was consecrated by many a\r\nlibation of fragrant tea.\r\n\r\n"Lucy, my dear," said Miss Wodehouse, whose gentle forehead was\r\npuckered with care, "I want to speak to you. I have not been able to\r\nget you out of my mind since ever we met Mr Wentworth at the green\r\ndoor."\r\n\r\n"Was there any need for getting me out of your mind?" said smiling\r\nLucy. "I was a safe enough inmate, surely. I wonder how often I am out\r\nof your mind, Mary dear, night or day."\r\n\r\n"That is true enough," said Miss Wodehouse, "but you know that is not\r\nwhat I meant either. Lucy, are you quite sure you\'re going on just as\r\nyou ought--"\r\n\r\nHere she made a troubled pause, and looked in the laughing face\r\nopposite, intent upon her with its startled eyes. "What have I done?"\r\ncried the younger sister. Miss Wodehouse shook her head with a great\r\ndeal of seriousness.\r\n\r\n"It always begins with laughing," said the experienced woman; "but if\r\nit ends without tears it will be something new to me. It\'s about Mr\r\nWentworth, Lucy. You\'re always together, day after day; and, my dear,\r\nsuch things can\'t go on without coming to something--what is to come\r\nof it? I have looked at it from every point of view, and I am sure I\r\ndon\'t know."\r\n\r\nLucy flushed intensely red, of course, at the Curate\'s name; perhaps\r\nshe had not expected it just at that moment; but she kept her\r\ncomposure like a sensible girl as she was.\r\n\r\n"I thought it was the other side that were questioned about their\r\nintentions," she said. "Am I doing anything amiss? Mr Wentworth is the\r\nCurate of St Roque\'s, and I am one of the district-visitors, and we\r\ncan\'t help seeing a great deal of each other so long as this work goes\r\non at Wharfside. You wouldn\'t like to stop a great work because we are\r\nobliged to see a good deal of--of one particular person?" said Lucy,\r\nwith youthful virtue, looking at her sister\'s face; at which tone and\r\nlook Miss Wodehouse immediately faltered, as the culprit knew she\r\nmust.\r\n\r\n"No--oh no, no--to be sure not," said the disturbed monitor. "When you\r\nsay that, I don\'t know how to answer you. It must be right, I suppose.\r\nI am quite sure it is wonderful to see such young creatures as you,\r\nand how you can tell the right way to set about it. But things did not\r\nuse to be so in my young days. Girls dare not have done such things\r\ntwenty years ago--not in Carlingford, Lucy," said Miss Wodehouse;\r\n"and, dear, I think you ought to be a little careful, for poor Mr\r\nWentworth\'s sake."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think Mr Wentworth is in any particular danger," said Lucy,\r\nputting down her cup, with a slight curve at the corners of her\r\npretty mouth--"and it is quite time for you to begin dressing. You\r\nknow you don\'t like to be hurried, dear;" with which speech the young\r\nhousekeeper got up from her easy-chair, gave her sister a kiss as she\r\npassed, and went away, singing softly, to her toilette. Perhaps there\r\nwas a little flutter in Lucy\'s heart as she bound it round with her\r\nfavourite blue ribbons. Perhaps it was this that gave a certain\r\nstartled gleam to her blue eyes, and made even her father remark them\r\nwhen she went down-stairs--"It seems to me as if this child were\r\ngrowing rather pretty, Molly, eh? I don\'t know what other people\r\nthink," said Mr Wodehouse--and perhaps Mr Wentworth, who was just\r\nbeing ushered into the drawing-room at the moment, heard the speech,\r\nfor he, too, looked as if he had never found it out before. Luckily\r\nthere was a party, and no opportunity for sentiment. The party was in\r\nhonour of the Rector and his wife; and Mr Wentworth could not but be\r\nconscious before the evening was over that he had done something to\r\nlose the favour of his clerical brother. There was a good deal of\r\nChurch talk, as was natural, at the churchwarden\'s table, where three\r\nclergymen were dining--for Mr Morgan\'s curate was there as well; and\r\nthe Curate of St Roque\'s, who was slightly hot-tempered, could not\r\nhelp feeling himself disapproved of. It was not, on the whole, a\r\nsatisfactory evening. Mr Morgan talked rather big, when the ladies\r\nwent away, of his plans for the reformation of Carlingford. He went\r\ninto statistics about the poor, and the number of people who attended\r\nno church, without taking any notice of that "great work" which Mr\r\nWentworth knew to be going on at Wharfside. The Rector even talked of\r\nWharfside, and of the necessity of exertion on behalf of that wretched\r\ndistrict, with a studious unconsciousness of Mr Wentworth; and all but\r\ndeclined to receive better information when Mr Wodehouse proffered it.\r\nMatters were scarcely better in the drawing-room, where Lucy was\r\nentertaining everybody, and had no leisure for the Perpetual Curate.\r\nHe took his hat with a gloomy sentiment of satisfaction when it was\r\ntime to go away; but when the green door was closed behind him, Mr\r\nWentworth, with his first step into the dewy darkness, plunged\r\nheadlong into a sea of thought. He had to walk down the whole length\r\nof Grange Lane to his lodging, which was in the last house of the row,\r\na small house in a small garden, where Mrs Hadwin, the widow of a\r\nwhilom curate, was permitted by public opinion, on the score of her\r\nown unexceptionable propriety,[A] to receive a lodger without loss of\r\nposition thereby. It was moonlight, or rather it ought to have been\r\nmoonlight, and no lamps were lighted in Grange Lane, according to the\r\neconomical regulations of Carlingford; and as Mr Wentworth pursued his\r\nway down the dark line of garden-walls, in the face of a sudden April\r\nshower which happened to be falling, he had full scope and opportunity\r\nfor his thoughts.\r\n\r\nThese thoughts were not the most agreeable in the world. In the first\r\nplace it must be remembered that for nearly a year past Mr Wentworth had\r\nhad things his own way in Carlingford. He had been more than rector, he\r\nhad been archdeacon, or rather bishop, in Mr Proctor\'s time; for that\r\ngood man was humble, and thankful for the advice and assistance of his\r\nyoung brother, who knew so much better than he did. Now, to be looked\r\nupon as an unauthorised workman, a kind of meddling, Dissenterish,\r\nmissionising individual, was rather hard upon the young man. And then he\r\nthought of his aunts. The connection, imperceptible to an ignorant\r\nobserver, which existed between the Miss Wentworths and Mr Morgan, and\r\nLucy, and many other matters interesting to their nephew, was a\r\nsufficiently real connection when you came to know it. That parish of\r\nhis own which Miss Wodehouse had wished him--which would free the young\r\nclergyman from all trammels so far as his work was concerned; and would\r\nenable him to marry, and do everything for him--it was in the power of\r\nthe Miss Wentworths to bestow; but they were Evangelical women, very\r\npublic-spirited, and thinking nothing of their nephew in comparison with\r\ntheir duty; and he was at that time of life, and of that disposition,\r\nwhich, for fear of being supposed to wish to deceive them, would rather\r\nexaggerate and make a display of the difference of his own views. Not\r\nfor freedom, not for Lucy, would the Perpetual Curate temporise and\r\nmanage the matter; so the fact was that he stood at the present moment\r\nin a very perilous predicament. But for this family living, which was,\r\nwith their mother\'s property, in the hands of her co-heiresses, the\r\nthree Miss Wentworths, young Frank Wentworth had not a chance of\r\npreferment in the world; for the respectable Squire his father had\r\nindulged in three wives and three families, and such a regiment of sons\r\nthat all his influence had been fully taxed to provide for them. Gerald,\r\nthe clergyman of the first lot, held the family living--not a very large\r\none--which belonged to the Wentworths; and Frank, who was of the second,\r\nhad been educated expressly with an eye to Skelmersdale, which belonged\r\nto his aunts. How he came at the end to differ so completely from these\r\nexcellent ladies in his religious views is not our business just at\r\npresent; but in the mean time matters were in a very critical position.\r\nThe old incumbent of Skelmersdale was eighty, and had been ill all\r\nwinter; and if the Miss Wentworths were not satisfied somehow, it was\r\nall over with their nephew\'s hopes.\r\n\r\nSuch were the thoughts that occupied his mind as he walked down Grange\r\nLane in the dark, past the tedious, unsympathetic line of garden-walls,\r\nwith the rain in his face. The evening\'s entertainment had stirred up a\r\ngreat many dormant sentiments. His influence in Carlingford had been\r\nignored by this new-comer, who evidently thought he could do what he\r\nliked without paying any attention to the Curate of St Roque\'s; and,\r\nwhat was a great deal worse, he had found Lucy unapproachable, and had\r\nrealised, if not for the first time, still with more distinctness than\r\never before, that she did not belong to him, and that he had no more\r\nright than any other acquaintance to monopolise her society. This last\r\ndiscovery was bitter to the young man--it was this that made him set his\r\nface to the rain, and his teeth, as if that could do any good. He had\r\nbeen happy in her mere society to-day, without entering into any of the\r\nterrible preliminaries of a closer connection. But now that was over.\r\nShe did not belong to him, and he could not bear the thought. And how\r\nwas she ever to belong to him? Not, certainly, if he was to be a Perpetual\r\nCurate of St Roque\'s, or anywhere else. He felt, in the misery of the\r\nmoment, as if he could never go to that green door again, or walk by her\r\nsweet side to that service in which they had joined so lately. He\r\nwondered whether she cared, with a despairing pang of anxiety, through\r\nwhich for an instant a celestial gleam of consciousness leaped, making\r\nthe darkness all the greater afterwards. And to think that three old\r\nladies, of whom it was not in the nature of things that the young man\r\ncould be profoundly reverent, should hold in their hands the absolute\r\npower of his life, and could determine whether it was to be sweet with\r\nhope and love, or stern, constrained, and impoverished, without Lucy or\r\nany other immediate light! What a strange anomaly this was which met him\r\nfull in the face as he pursued his thoughts! If it had been his bishop,\r\nor his college, or any fitting tribunal--but his aunts! Mr Wentworth\'s\r\nring at his own door was so much more hasty than usual that Mrs Hadwin\r\npaused in the hall, when she had lighted her candle, to see if anything\r\nwas the matter. The little neat old lady held up her candle to look at\r\nhim as he came in, glistening all over with rain-drops.\r\n\r\n"I hope you are not wet, Mr Wentworth," she said. "It is only an April\r\nshower, and we want it so much in the gardens. And I hope you have had\r\na nice party and a pleasant evening."\r\n\r\n"Thank you--pretty well," said the Perpetual Curate, with less suavity\r\nthan usual, and a sigh that nearly blew Mrs Hadwin\'s candle out. She\r\nsaw he was discomposed, and therefore, with a feminine instinct, found\r\nmore to say than usual before she made her peaceful way to bed. She\r\nwaited while Mr Wentworth lighted his candle too. "Mr Wodehouse\'s\r\nparties are always pleasant," she said. "I never go out, you know; but\r\nI like to hear of people enjoying themselves. I insist upon you going\r\nup-stairs before me, Mr Wentworth. I have so little breath to spare,\r\nand I take such a long time going up, that you would be tired to death\r\nwaiting for me. Now, don\'t be polite. I insist upon you going up\r\nfirst. Thank you. Now I can take my time."\r\n\r\nAnd she took her time accordingly, keeping Mr Wentworth waiting on the\r\nlanding to say good-night to her, much to his silent exasperation. When\r\nhe got into the shelter of his own sitting-room, he threw himself upon\r\na sofa, and continued his thoughts with many a troubled addition. A\r\nyoung man, feeling in a great measure the world before him, conscious of\r\nconsiderable powers, standing on the very threshold of so much possible\r\ngood and happiness,--it was hideous to look up, in his excited\r\nimagination, and see the figures of these three old ladies, worse than\r\nFates, standing across the prospect and barring the way.\r\n\r\nAnd Lucy, meantime, was undoing her blue ribbons with a thrill of sweet\r\nagitation in her untroubled bosom. Perhaps Mary was right, and it was\r\nabout coming to the time when this half-feared, half-hoped revelation\r\ncould not be postponed much longer. For it will be perceived that Lucy\r\nwas not in much doubt of young Wentworth\'s sentiments. And then she\r\npaused in the dark, after she had said her prayers, to give one timid\r\nthought to the sweet life that seemed to lie before her so close at\r\nhand--in which, perhaps, he and she were to go out together, she did not\r\nknow where, for the help of the world and the comfort of the sorrowful;\r\nand not trusting herself to look much at that ideal, said another\r\nprayer, and went to sleep like one of God\'s beloved, with a tear too\r\nexquisite to be shed brimming under her long eyelashes. At this crisis\r\nof existence, perhaps for once in her life, the woman has the best of\r\nit; for very different from Lucy\'s were the thoughts with which the\r\nCurate sought his restless pillow, hearing the rain drip all the night,\r\nand trickle into Mrs Hadwin\'s reservoirs. The old lady had a passion for\r\nrain-water, and it was a gusty night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\nNext week was Passion Week, and full of occupation. Even if it had been\r\nconsistent either with Mr Wentworth\'s principles or Lucy\'s to introduce\r\nsecular affairs into so holy a season, they had not time or opportunity,\r\nas it happened, which was perhaps just as well; for otherwise the\r\npremonitory thrill of expectation which had disturbed Lucy\'s calm, and\r\nthe bitter exasperation against himself and his fate with which Mr\r\nWentworth had discovered that he dared not say anything, might have\r\ncaused an estrangement between them. As it was, the air was thundery and\r\nominous through all the solemn days of the Holy Week. A consciousness as\r\nof something about to happen overshadowed even the "district," and\r\nattracted the keen observation of the lively spectators at Wharfside.\r\nThey were not greatly up in matters of doctrine, nor perhaps did they\r\nquite understand the eloquent little sermon which the Perpetual Curate\r\ngave them on Good Friday in the afternoon, between his own services, by\r\nway of impressing upon their minds the awful memories of the day; but\r\nthey were as skilful in the variations of their young evangelist\'s\r\nlooks, and as well qualified to decide upon the fact that there was "a\r\nsomething between" him and Miss Lucy Wodehouse, as any practised\r\nobserver in the higher ranks of society. Whether the two had "\'ad an\r\nunpleasantness," as, Wharfside was well aware, human creatures under\r\nsuch circumstances are liable to have, the interested community could\r\nnot quite make out; but that something more than ordinary was going on,\r\nand that the prettiest of all the "Provident ladies" had a certain\r\npreoccupation in her blue eyes, was a fact perfectly apparent to\r\nthat intelligent society. And, indeed, one of the kinder matrons in\r\nPrickett\'s Lane had even ventured so far as to wish Miss Lucy "a \'appy\r\nweddin\' when the time comes." "And there\'s to be a sight o\' weddings\r\nthis Easter," had added another, who was somewhat scandalised by the\r\nflowers in the bonnet of one of the brides-elect, and proceeded to say\r\nso in some detail. "But Miss Lucy won\'t wear no bonnet; the quality goes\r\nin veils: and there never was as full a church as there will be to see\r\nit, wishing you your \'ealth and \'appiness, ma\'am, as aint no more nor\r\nyou deserve, and you so good to us poor folks." All which felicitations\r\nand inquiries had confused Lucy, though she made her way out of them\r\nwith a self-possession which amazed her sister.\r\n\r\n"You see what everybody thinks, dear," said that gentle woman, when\r\nthey had made their escape.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mary, how can you talk of such things at such a time?" the young\r\nSister of Mercy had answered once more, turning those severe eyes of\r\nyouthful devotion upon her troubled elder sister, who, to tell the\r\ntruth, not having been brought up to it, as she said, felt much the\r\nsame on Easter Eve as at other times of her life; and thus once more\r\nthe matter concluded. As for Mr Wentworth, he was much occupied on\r\nthat last day of the Holy Week with a great many important matters on\r\nhand. He had not seen the Wodehouses since the Good Friday evening\r\nservice, which was an interval of about twenty hours, and had just\r\npaused, before eating his bachelor\'s dinner, to ponder whether it\r\nwould be correct on that most sacred of vigils to steal away for half\r\nan hour, just to ask Lucy if she thought it necessary that he should\r\nsee the sick woman at No. 10 Prickett\'s Lane before the morning.\r\nIt was while he was pondering this matter in his mind that Mr\r\nWentworth\'s heart jumped to his throat upon receipt, quite suddenly,\r\nwithout preparation, of the following note:--\r\n\r\n\r\n "MY DEAREST BOY,--Your aunts Cecilia, Leonora, and I have just arrived\r\n at this excellent inn, the Blue Boar. Old Mr Shirley at Skelmersdale\r\n is in a very bad way, poor man, and I thought the _very best_ thing I\r\n could do in my dearest Frank\'s _best_ interests, was to persuade them\r\n to make you _quite_ an _unexpected visit_, and see everything for\r\n themselves. I am in a terrible fright now lest I should have done\r\n wrong; but my dear, dear boy knows it is always his interest that I\r\n have at heart; and Leonora is so intent on having a _real gospel\r\n minister_ at Skelmersdale, that she _never_ would have been content\r\n with anything less than hearing you with her own ears. I hope and\r\n trust in Providence that you don\'t intone like poor Gerald. And oh,\r\n Frank, my dear boy, come directly and dine with us, and don\'t fly in\r\n your aunt Leonora\'s face, and tell me I haven\'t been imprudent. I\r\n thought it would be best to take you unawares when you had everything\r\n prepared, and when we should see you just as you always are; for I am\r\n convinced Leonora and you only want to see more of each other to\r\n understand each other perfectly. Come, my dearest boy, and give a\r\n little comfort to your loving and anxious\r\n\r\n "AUNT DORA."\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Wentworth sat gazing blankly upon this horrible missive for some\r\nminutes after he had read it, quite unaware of the humble presence of\r\nthe maid who stood asking, Please was she to bring up dinner? When he\r\ncame to himself, the awful "No!" with which he answered that alarmed\r\nhandmaiden almost drove her into hysterics as she escaped down-stairs.\r\nHowever, Mr Wentworth immediately put his head out at the door and\r\ncalled after her, "I can\'t wait for dinner, Sarah; I am suddenly called\r\nout, and shall dine where I am going. Tell Cook," said the young parson,\r\nsuddenly recollecting Lucy\'s client, "to send what she has prepared for\r\nme, if it is very nice, to No. 10 Prickett\'s Lane. My boy will take it;\r\nand send him off directly, please," with which last commission the young\r\nman went up despairingly to his bedroom to prepare himself for this\r\ninterview with his aunts. What was he to do? Already before him, in\r\ndreadful prophetic vision, he saw all three seated in one of the\r\nhandsome open benches in St Roque\'s, looking indescribable horrors at\r\nthe crown of spring lilies which Lucy\'s own fingers were to weave for\r\nthe cross above the altar, and listening to the cadence of his own manly\r\ntenor as it rang through the perfect little church of which he was so\r\nproud. Yes, there was an end of Skelmersdale, without any doubt or\r\nquestion now; whatever hope there might have been, aunt Dora had settled\r\nthe matter by this last move of hers--an end to Skelmersdale, and an end\r\nof Lucy. Perhaps he had better try not to see her any more; and the poor\r\nyoung priest saw that his own face looked ghastly as he looked at it in\r\nthe glass. It gave him a little comfort to meet the boy with a bundle\r\npinned up in snowy napkins, from which a grateful odour ascended,\r\nbending his steps to Prickett\'s Lane, as he himself went out to meet his\r\nfate. It was a last offering to that beloved "district" with which the\r\nimage of his love was blended; but he would have given his dinner to\r\nLucy\'s sick woman any day. To-night it was a greater sacrifice that was\r\nto be required of him. He went mournfully and slowly up Grange Lane,\r\nsteeling himself for the encounter, and trying to forgive aunt Dora in\r\nhis heart. It was not very easy. Things might have turned out just the\r\nsame without any interference--that was true; but to have it all brought\r\non in this wanton manner by a kind foolish woman, who would wring her\r\nhands and gaze in your face, and want to know, Oh! did you think it was\r\nher fault? after she had precipitated the calamity, was very hard; and\r\nit was with a very gloomy countenance, accordingly, that the Curate of\r\nSt Roque\'s presented himself at the Blue Boar.\r\n\r\nThe Miss Wentworths were in the very best sitting-room which the Blue\r\nBoar contained--the style in which they travelled, with a man and two\r\nmaids, was enough to secure that; and the kitchen of that respectable\r\nestablishment was doing its very best to send up a dinner worthy of "a\r\nparty as had their own man to wait." The three ladies greeted their\r\nnephew with varying degrees of enthusiasm. The eldest, Miss Wentworth,\r\nfrom whom he took his second name Cecil, did not rise from her chair,\r\nbut nevertheless kissed him in an affectionate dignified way when he\r\nwas brought to her. As for aunt Dora, she ran into her dear Frank\'s\r\narms, and in the very moment of that embrace whispered in his ear the\r\nexpression of her anxiety, and the panic which always followed those\r\nrash steps which she was in the habit of taking. "Oh, my dear, I hope\r\nyou don\'t think I\'m to blame," she said, with her lips at his ear, and\r\ngained but cold comfort from the Curate\'s face. The alarming member of\r\nthe party was Miss Leonora. She rose and made two steps forward to\r\nmeet the unfortunate young man. She shook both his hands cordially,\r\nand said she was very glad to see him, and hoped he was well. She was\r\nthe sensible sister of the three, and no doubt required all the sense\r\nshe had to manage her companions. Miss Wentworth, who had been very\r\npretty in her youth, was now a beautiful old lady, with snow-white\r\nhair and the most charming smile; and Miss Dora, who was only fifty,\r\nretained the natural colour of her own scanty light-brown locks, which\r\nwavered in weak-minded ringlets over her cheeks; but Miss Leonora was\r\niron-grey, without any complexion in particular, and altogether a\r\nharder type of woman. It was she who held in her hands the fate of\r\nSkelmersdale and of Frank Wentworth. Her terrible glance it was which\r\nhe had imagined gleaming fierce upon his lilies--Lucy\'s lilies, his\r\nEaster decorations. It was by her side the alarmed Curate was made to\r\nsit down. It was she who took the foot of the table, and was the\r\ngentleman of the house. Her voice was of that class of voice which may\r\nbe politely called a powerful contralto. Every way she was as alarming\r\na critic as ever was encountered by a Perpetual Curate, or any other\r\nyoung man in trouble. Mr Wentworth said feebly that this was a very\r\nunexpected pleasure, as he met his aunt Leonora\'s eye.\r\n\r\n"I hope it _is_ a pleasure," said that penetrating observer. "To tell\r\nthe truth, I did not expect it would be; but your aunt Dora thought so,\r\nand you know, when she sets her heart on anything, nobody can get any\r\npeace. Not that your aunt Cecilia and I would have come on that account,\r\nif we had not wished, for many reasons, to have some conversation with\r\nyou, and see how you are getting on."\r\n\r\n"Quite so, Leonora," said Miss Wentworth, smiling upon her nephew, and\r\nleaning back in her chair.\r\n\r\nThen there was a little pause; for, after such a terrible address, it\r\nwas not to be expected that the poor man, who understood every word of\r\nit, could repeat his commonplace about the unlooked-for pleasure. Miss\r\nDora of course seized the opportunity to rush in.\r\n\r\n"We have been hearing such delightful things about you, my dear, from\r\nthe people of the house. Leonora is so pleased to hear how you are\r\nlabouring among the people, and doing your Master\'s work. We take all\r\nthe happiness to ourselves, because, you know, you are _our_ boy,\r\nFrank," said the anxious aunt, all her thin ringlets, poor lady,\r\ntrembling with her eagerness to make everything comfortable for her\r\nfavourite; "and we have come, you know, specially to hear you on Easter\r\nSunday in your own church. I am looking forward to a great treat: to\r\nthink I should never have heard you, though it is so long since you were\r\nordained! None of us have ever heard you--not even Leonora; but it is\r\nsuch a pleasure to us all to know you are so much liked in Carlingford,"\r\ncried the troubled woman, growing nervous at sight of the unresponsive\r\nquiet around her. Miss Leonora by no means replied to the covert\r\nappeals thus made to her. She left her nephew and her sister to keep up\r\nthe conversation unassisted; and as for Miss Wentworth, conversation was\r\nnot her forte.\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid, aunt, you will not _hear_ anything worth such a long\r\njourney," said Mr Wentworth, moved, like a rash young man as he was, to\r\ndisplay his colours at once, and cry no surrender. "I don\'t think an\r\nEaster Sunday is a time for much preaching; and the Church has made such\r\nample provision for the expression of our sentiments. I am more of a\r\nhumble priest than an ambitious preacher," said the young man, with\r\ncharacteristic youthful pretence of the most transparent kind. He looked\r\nin Miss Leonora\'s face as he spoke. He knew the very name of priest was\r\nan offence in its way to that highly Evangelical woman; and if they were\r\nto come to single combat, better immediately than after intolerable\r\nsuspense and delay.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps, Dora, you will postpone your raptures about Frank\'s\r\nsermon--which may be a very indifferent sermon, as he says, for anything\r\nwe can tell--till after dinner," said Miss Leonora. "We\'re all very glad\r\nto see him; and he need not think any little ill-tempered speeches he\r\nmay make will disturb me. I daresay the poor boy would be glad to hear\r\nof some of the people belonging to him instead of all that nonsense.\r\nCome to dinner, Frank. Take the other side of the table, opposite Dora;\r\nand now that you\'ve said grace, I give you full leave to forget that\r\nyou\'re a clergyman for an hour at least. We were down at the old Hall a\r\nweek ago, and saw your father and the rest. They are all well; and the\r\nlast boy is rather like you, if you will think that any compliment. Mrs\r\nWentworth is pleased, because you are one of the handsome ones, you\r\nknow. Not much fear of the Wentworths dying out of the country yet\r\nawhile. Your father is getting at his wit\'s end, and does not know what\r\nto do with Cuthbert and Guy. Three sons are enough in the army, and two\r\nat sea; and I rather think it\'s as much as we can stand," continued Miss\r\nLeonora, not without a gleam of humour in her iron-grey eyes, "to have\r\ntwo in the Church\r\n."\r\n\r\n"That is as it may happen," said the Perpetual Curate, with a little\r\nspirit. "If the boys are of my way of thinking, they will consider the\r\nChurch the highest of professions; but Guy and Cuthbert must go to\r\nAustralia, I suppose, like most other people, and take their chance--no\r\nharm in that."\r\n\r\n"Not a bit of harm," said the rich aunt; "they\'re good boys enough,\r\nand I daresay they\'ll get on. As for Gerald, if you have any influence\r\nwith your brother, I think he\'s in a bad way. I think he has a bad\r\nattack of Romishness coming on. If you are not in that way yourself,"\r\nsaid Miss Leonora, with a sharp glance, "I think you should go and see\r\nafter Gerald. He is the sort of man who would do anything foolish, you\r\nknow. He doesn\'t understand what prudence means. Remember, I believe\r\nhe is a good Christian all the same. It\'s very incomprehensible; but\r\nthe fact is, a man may be a very good Christian, and have the least\r\nquality of sense that is compatible with existence. I\'ve seen it over\r\nand over again. Gerald\'s notions are idiocy to me," said the sensible\r\nbut candid woman, shrugging her shoulders; "but I can\'t deny that he\'s\r\na good man, for all that."\r\n\r\n"He is the best man I ever knew," said young Wentworth, with\r\nenthusiasm.\r\n\r\n"Quite so, Frank," echoed aunt Cecilia, with her sweet smile: it was\r\nalmost the only conversational effort Miss Wentworth ever made.\r\n\r\n"But it is so sad to see how he\'s led away," said Miss Dora; "it is all\r\nowing to the bad advisers young men meet with at the universities; and\r\nhow can it be otherwise as long as tutors and professors are chosen just\r\nfor their learning, without any regard to their principles? What is\r\nGreek and Latin in comparison with a pious guide for the young? We\r\nwould not have to feel frightened, as we do so often, about young\r\nmen\'s principles," continued aunt Dora, fixing her eyes with warning\r\nsignificance on her nephew, and trying hard to open telegraphic\r\ncommunications with him, "if more attention was paid at the universities\r\nto give them sound guidance in their studies. So long as you are sound\r\nin your principles, there is no fear of you," said the timid diplomatist,\r\ntrying to aid the warning look of her eyes by emphasis and inflection.\r\nPoor Miss Dora! it was her unlucky fate, by dint of her very exertions\r\nin smoothing matters, always to make things worse.\r\n\r\n"He would be a bold man who would call those principles unsound which\r\nhave made my brother Gerald what he is," said, with an affectionate\r\nadmiration that became him, the Curate of St Roque\'s.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a slavish system, notwithstanding Gerald," said Miss Leonora,\r\nwith some heat; "and a false system, and leads to Antichrist at the\r\nend and nothing less. Eat your dinner, Frank--we are not going to\r\nargue just now. We expected to hear that another of the girls was\r\nengaged before we came away, but it has not occurred yet. I don\'t\r\napprove of young men dancing about a house for ever and ever, unless\r\nthey mean something. Do you?"\r\n\r\nMr Wentworth faltered at this question; it disturbed his composure\r\nmore than anything that had preceded it. "I--really I don\'t know," he\r\nsaid, after a pause, with a sickly smile--of which all three of his\r\naunts took private notes, forming their own conclusions. It was, as\r\nmay well be supposed, a very severe ordeal which the poor young man\r\nhad to go through. When he was permitted to say good-night, he went\r\naway with a sensation of fatigue more overpowering than if he had\r\nvisited all the houses in Wharfside. When he passed the green door,\r\nover which the apple-tree rustled in the dark, it was a pang to his\r\nheart. How was he to continue to live--to come and go through that\r\nfamiliar road--to go through all the meetings and partings, when this\r\nlast hopeless trial was over, and Lucy and he were swept apart as if\r\nby an earthquake? If his lips were sealed henceforward, and he never\r\nwas at liberty to say what was in his heart, what would she think of\r\nhim? He could not fly from his work because he lost Skelmersdale; and\r\nhow was he to bear it? He went home with a dull bitterness in his\r\nmind, trying, when he thought of it, to quiet the aching pulses which\r\nthrobbed all over him, with what ought to have been the hallowed\r\nassociations of the last Lenten vigil. But it was difficult, throbbing\r\nas he was with wild life and trouble to the very finger-points, to get\r\nhimself into the shadow of that rock-hewn grave, by which, according\r\nto his own theory, the Church should be watching on this Easter Eve.\r\nIt was hard just then to be bound to that special remembrance. What he\r\nwanted at this moment was no memory of one hour, however memorable or\r\nglorious, not even though it contained the Redeemer\'s grave, but the\r\nsense of a living Friend standing by him in the great struggle, which\r\nis the essential and unfailing comfort of a Christian\'s life.\r\n\r\nNext morning he went to church with a half-conscious, youthful sense of\r\nmartyrdom, of which in his heart he was half ashamed. St Roque\'s was\r\nvery fair to see that Easter morning. Above the communion-table, with\r\nall its sacred vessels, the carved oaken cross of the reredos was\r\nwreathed tenderly with white fragrant festoons of spring lilies, sweet\r\nNarcissus of the poets; and Mr Wentworth\'s choristers made another white\r\nline, two deep, down each side of the chancel. The young Anglican took\r\nin all the details of the scene on his way to the reading-desk as the\r\nwhite procession ranged itself in the oaken stalls. At that moment--the\r\nworst moment for such a thought--it suddenly flashed over him that,\r\nafter all, a wreath of spring flowers or a chorister\'s surplice was\r\nscarcely worth suffering martyrdom for. This horrible suggestion, true\r\nessence of an unheroic age, which will not suffer a man to be absolutely\r\nsure of anything, disturbed his prayer as he knelt down in silence to\r\nask God\'s blessing. Easter, to be sure, was lovely enough of itself\r\nwithout the garland, and Mr Wentworth knew well enough that his\r\nwhite-robed singers were no immaculate angel-band. It was Satan himself,\r\nsurely, and no inferior imp, who shot that sudden arrow into the young\r\nman\'s heart as he tried to say his private prayer; for the Curate of St\r\nRoque\'s was not only a fervent Anglican, but also a young Englishman\r\n_sans reproche_, with all the sensitive, almost fantastic, delicacy of\r\nhonour which belongs to that development of humanity; and not for a\r\ndozen worlds would he have sacrificed a lily or a surplice on this\r\nparticular Easter, when all his worldly hopes hung in the balance. But\r\nto think at this crowning moment that a villanous doubt of the benefit\r\nof these surplices and lilies should seize his troubled heart! for just\r\nthen the strains of the organ died away in lengthened whispers, and Miss\r\nLeonora Wentworth, severe and awful, swept up through the middle aisle.\r\nIt was under these terrible circumstances that the Perpetual Curate,\r\nwith his heart throbbing and his head aching, began to intone the\r\nmorning service on that Easter Sunday, ever after a day so memorable in\r\nthe records of St Roque\'s.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Wentworth\'s sermon on Easter Sunday was one which he himself long\r\nremembered, though it is doubtful whether any of his congregation had\r\nmemories as faithful. To tell the truth, the young man put a black cross\r\nupon it with his blackest ink, a memorial of meaning unknown to anybody\r\nbut himself. It was a curious little sermon, such as may still be heard\r\nin some Anglican pulpits. Though he had heart and mind enough to\r\nconceive something of those natural depths of divine significance and\r\nhuman interest, which are the very essence of the Easter festival, it\r\nwas not into these that Mr Wentworth entered in his sermon. He spoke, in\r\nvery choice little sentences, of the beneficence of the Church in\r\nappointing such a feast, and of all the beautiful arrangements she had\r\nmade for the keeping of it. But even in the speaking, in the excited\r\nstate of mind he was in, it occurred to the young man to see, by a\r\nsudden flash of illumination, how much higher, how much more catholic,\r\nafter all, his teaching would have been, could he but have once ignored\r\nthe Church, and gone direct, as Nature bade, to that empty grave in\r\nwhich all the hopes of humanity had been entombed. He saw it by gleams\r\nof that perverse light which seemed more Satanic than heavenly in the\r\nmoments it chose for shining, while he was preaching his little sermon\r\nabout the Church and her beautiful institution of Easter, just as he had\r\nseen the non-importance of his lily-wreath and surplices as he was about\r\nto suffer martyrdom for them. All these circumstances were hard upon the\r\nyoung man. Looking down straight into the severe iron-grey eyes of his\r\naunt Leonora, he could not of course so much as modify a single sentence\r\nof the discourse he was uttering, no more than he could permit himself\r\nto slur over a single monotone of the service; but that sudden bewildering\r\nperception that he could have done so much better--that the loftiest\r\nHigh-Churchism of all might have been consistent enough with\r\nSkelmersdale, had he but gone into the heart of the matter--gave a\r\nbitterness to the deeper, unseen current of the Curate\'s thoughts.\r\n\r\nBesides, it was terrible to feel that he could not abstract himself from\r\npersonal concerns even in the most sacred duties. He was conscious that\r\nthe two elder sisters went away, and that only poor aunt Dora, her\r\nweak-minded ringlets limp with tears, came tremulous to the altar rails.\r\nWhen the service was over, and the young priest was disrobing himself,\r\nshe came to him and gave a spasmodic, sympathetic, half-reproachful\r\npressure to his hand. "Oh, Frank, my dear, I did it for the best," said\r\nMiss Dora, with a doleful countenance; and the Perpetual Curate knew\r\nthat his doom was sealed. He put the best face he could upon the matter,\r\nhaving sufficient doubts of his own wisdom to subdue the high temper of\r\nthe Wentworths for that moment at least.\r\n\r\n"What was it you did for the best?" said the Curate of St Roque\'s. "I\r\nsuppose, after all, it was no such great matter _hearing_ me as you\r\nthought; but I told you I was not an ambitious preacher. This is a day\r\nfor worship, not for talk."\r\n\r\n"Ah! yes," said Miss Dora; "but oh, Frank, my dear, it is hard upon me,\r\nafter all my expectations. It would have been so nice to have had you at\r\nSkelmersdale. I hoped you would marry Julia Trench, and we should all\r\nhave been so happy; and perhaps if I had not begged Leonora to come just\r\nnow, thinking it would be so nice to take you just in your usual\r\nway--but she must have known sooner or later," said poor aunt Dora,\r\nlooking wistfully in his face. "Oh, Frank, I hope you don\'t think I\'m to\r\nblame."\r\n\r\n"I never should have married Julia Trench," said the Curate, gloomily.\r\nHe did not enter into the question of Miss Dora\'s guilt or innocence--he\r\ngave a glance at the lilies on the altar, and a sigh. The chances were\r\nhe would never marry anybody, but loyalty to Lucy demanded instant\r\nrepudiation of any other possible bride. "Where are you going, aunt\r\nDora; back to the Blue Boar? or will you come with me?" he said, as they\r\nstood together at the door of St Roque\'s. Mr Wentworth felt as if he had\r\ncaught the beginning threads of a good many different lines of thought,\r\nwhich he would be glad to be alone to work out.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll come back with me to the inn to lunch?" said Miss Dora. "Oh,\r\nFrank, my dear, remember your Christian feelings, and don\'t make a\r\nbreach in the family. It will be bad enough to face your poor dear\r\nfather, after he knows what Leonora means to do; and I do so want to\r\ntalk to you," said the poor woman, eagerly clinging to his arm. "You\r\nalways were fond of your poor aunt Dora, Frank; when you were quite a\r\nlittle trot you used always to like me best; and in the holiday times,\r\nwhen you came down from Harrow, I used always to hear all your\r\ntroubles. If you would only have confidence in me now!"\r\n\r\n"But what if I have no troubles to confide?" said Mr Wentworth; "a man\r\nand a boy are very different things. Come, aunt Dora, I\'ll see you safe\r\nto your inn. What should I have to grumble about? I have plenty to do,\r\nand it is Easter; and few men can have everything their own way."\r\n\r\n"You won\'t acknowledge that you\'re vexed," said aunt Dora, almost crying\r\nunder her veil, "but I can see it all the same. You always were such a\r\ntrue Wentworth; but if you only would give in and say that you are\r\ndisappointed and angry with us all, I could bear it better, Frank. I\r\nwould not feel then that you thought it my fault! And oh, Frank, dear,\r\nyou don\'t consider how disappointed your poor dear aunt Leonora was!\r\nIt\'s just as hard upon us," she continued, pressing his arm in her\r\neagerness, "as it is upon you. We had all so set our hearts on having\r\nyou at Skelmersdale. Don\'t you think, if you were giving your mind to\r\nit, you might see things in a different light?" with another pressure of\r\nhis arm. "Oh, Frank, what does it matter, after all, if the heart is\r\nright, whether you read the service in your natural voice, or give that\r\nlittle quaver at the end? I am sure, for my part--"\r\n\r\n"My dear aunt," said Mr Wentworth, naturally incensed by this manner of\r\ndescription, "I must be allowed to say that my convictions are fixed,\r\nand not likely to be altered. I am a priest, and you are--a woman." He\r\nstopped short, with perhaps a little bitterness. It was very true she\r\nwas a woman, unqualified to teach, but yet she and her sisters were\r\nabsolute in Skelmersdale. He made a little gulp of his momentary\r\nirritation, and walked on in silence, with Miss Dora\'s kind wistful hand\r\nclinging to his arm.\r\n\r\n"But, dear Frank among us Protestants, you know, there is no sacerdotal\r\ncaste," said Miss Dora, opportunely recollecting some scrap of an Exeter\r\nHall speech. "We are all kings and priests to God. Oh, Frank, it is\r\nGerald\'s example that has led you away. I am sure, before you went to\r\nOxford you were never at all a ritualist--even Leonora thought you such\r\na pious boy; and I am sure your good sense must teach you--" faltered\r\naunt Dora, trying her sister\'s grand tone.\r\n\r\n"Hush, hush; I can\'t have you begin to argue with me; you are not my\r\naunt Leonora," said the Curate, half amused in spite of himself. This\r\nencouraged the anxious woman, and, clasping his arm closer than ever,\r\nshe poured out all her heart.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Frank, if you could only modify your views a little! It is not\r\nthat there is any difference between your views and ours, except just\r\nin words, my dear. Flowers are very pretty decorations, and I know you\r\nlook very nice in your surplice; and I am sure, for my part, I should\r\nnot mind--but then that is not carrying the Word of God to the people,\r\nas Leonora says. If the heart is right, what does it matter about the\r\naltar?" said aunt Dora, unconsciously falling upon the very argument\r\nthat had occurred to her nephew\'s perplexed mind in the pulpit. "Even\r\nthough I was in such trouble, I can\'t tell you what a happiness it was\r\nto take the sacrament from your hands, my dear, dear boy; and but for\r\nthese flowers and things that could do nobody any good, poor dear\r\nLeonora, who is very fond of you, though perhaps you don\'t think it,\r\ncould have had that happiness too. Oh, Frank, don\'t you think you\r\ncould give up these things that don\'t matter? If you were just to tell\r\nLeonora you have been thinking it over, and that you see you\'ve made a\r\nmistake, and that in future--"\r\n\r\n"You don\'t mean to insult me?" said the young man. "Hush--hush; you\r\ndon\'t know what you are saying. Not to be made Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury, instead of Vicar of Skelmersdale. I don\'t understand how\r\nyou could suggest such a thing to me."\r\n\r\nMiss Dora\'s veil, which she had partly lifted, here fell over her face,\r\nas it had kept doing all the time she was speaking--but this time she\r\ndid not put it back. She was no longer able to contain herself, but wept\r\nhot tears of distress and vexation, under the flimsy covering of lace.\r\n"No, of course, you will not do it--you will far rather be haughty, and\r\nsay it is my fault," said poor Miss Dora. "We have all so much pride, we\r\nWentworths--and you never think of our disappointment, and how we all\r\ncalculated upon having you at Skelmersdale, and how happy we were to\r\nbe, and that you were to marry Julia Trench--"\r\n\r\nIt was just at this moment that the two reached the corner of\r\nPrickett\'s Lane. Lucy Wodehouse had been down there seeing the sick\r\nwoman. She had, indeed, been carrying her dinner to that poor\r\ncreature, and was just turning into Grange Lane, with her blue ribbons\r\nhidden under the grey cloak, and a little basket in her hand. They met\r\nfull in the face at this corner, and Miss Dora\'s words reached Lucy\'s\r\nears, and went through and through her with a little nervous thrill.\r\nShe had not time to think whether it was pain or only surprise that\r\nmoved her, and was not even self-possessed enough to observe the\r\ntremulous pressure of the Curate\'s hand, as he shook hands with her,\r\nand introduced his aunt. "I have just been to see the poor woman at\r\nNo. 10," said Lucy. "She is very ill to-day. If you had time, it would\r\nbe kind of you to see her. I think she has something on her mind."\r\n\r\n"I will go there before I go to Wharfside," said Mr Wentworth. "Are\r\nyou coming down to the service this afternoon? I am afraid it will be\r\na long service, for there are all these little Burrowses, you know--"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I am godmother," said Lucy, and smiled and gave him her hand\r\nagain as she passed him while aunt Dora looked on with curious eyes.\r\nThe poor Curate heaved a mighty sigh as he looked after the grey\r\ncloak. Not his the privilege now, to walk with her to the green door,\r\nto take her basket from the soft hand of the merciful Sister. On the\r\ncontrary, he had to turn his back upon Lucy, and walk on with aunt\r\nDora to the inn--at this moment a symbolical action which seemed to\r\nembody his fate.\r\n\r\n"Where is Wharfside? and who are the little Burrowses? and what does\r\nthe young lady mean by being godmother?" said aunt Dora. "She looks\r\nvery sweet and nice; but what is the meaning of that grey cloak? Oh,\r\nFrank, I hope you don\'t approve of nunneries, and that sort of thing.\r\nIt is such foolishness. My dear, the Christian life is very hard, as\r\nyour aunt Leonora always says. She says she can\'t bear to see people\r\nplaying at Christianity--"\r\n\r\n"People should not speak of things they don\'t understand," said the\r\nPerpetual Curate. "Your Exeter-Hall men, aunt Dora, are like the old\r\nascetics--they try to make a merit of Christianity by calling it hard\r\nand terrible; but there are some sweet souls in the world, to whom it\r\ncomes natural as sunshine in May." And the young Anglican, with a glance\r\nbehind him from the corner of his eye, followed the fair figure, which\r\nhe believed he was never, with a clear conscience, to accompany any\r\nmore. "Now, here is your inn," he said, after a little pause. "Wharfside\r\nis a district, where I am going presently to conduct service, and the\r\nlittle Burrowses are a set of little heathens, to whom I am to\r\nadminister holy baptism this Easter Sunday. Good-bye just now."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Frank, my dear, just come in for a moment, and tell Leonora--it\r\nwill show her how wrong she is," said poor aunt Dora, clinging to his\r\narm.\r\n\r\n"Right or wrong, I am not going into any controversy. My aunt Leonora\r\nknows perfectly well what she is doing," said the Curate, with the best\r\nsmile he could muster; and so shook hands with her resolutely, and\r\nwalked back again all the way down Grange Lane, past the green door, to\r\nhis own house. Nobody was about the green door at that particular moment\r\nto ask him in to luncheon, as sometimes happened. He walked down all the\r\nway to Mrs Hadwin\'s, with something of the sensations of a man who has\r\njust gone through a dreadful operation, and feels, with a kind of dull\r\nsurprise after, that everything around him is just the same as before.\r\nHe had come through a fiery trial, though nobody knew of it; and just at\r\nthis moment, when he wanted all his strength, how strange to feel that\r\nhaunting sense of an unnecessary sacrifice--that troubled new vein of\r\nthought which would be worked out, and which concerned matters more\r\nimportant than Skelmersdale, weighty as that was. He took his sermon out\r\nof his pocket when he got home, and marked a cross upon it, as we have\r\nalready said; but, being still a young man, he was thankful to snatch a\r\nmorsel of lunch, and hasten out again to his duty, instead of staying to\r\nargue the question with himself. He went to No. 10 Prickett\'s Lane, and\r\nwas a long time with the sick woman, listening to all the woeful tale of\r\na troubled life, which the poor sick creature had been contemplating for\r\ndays and days, in her solitude, through those strange exaggerated\r\ndeath-gleams which Miss Leonora would have called "the light of\r\neternity." She remembered all sorts of sins, great and small, which\r\nfilled her with nervous terrors; and it was not till close upon the hour\r\nfor the Wharfside service, that the Curate could leave his tremulous\r\npenitent. The schoolroom was particularly full that day. Easter,\r\nperhaps, had touched the hearts--it certainly had refreshed the\r\ntoilettes--of the bargemen\'s wives and daughters. Some of them felt an\r\ninward conviction that their new ribbons were undoubtedly owing to the\r\nclergyman\'s influence, and that Tom and Jim would have bestowed the\r\nmoney otherwise before the Church planted her pickets in this corner of\r\nthe enemy\'s camp; and the conviction, though not of an elevated\r\ndescription, was a great deal better than no conviction at all. Mr\r\nWentworth\'s little sermon to them was a great improvement upon his\r\nsermon at St Roque\'s. He told them about the empty grave of Christ, and\r\nhow He called the weeping woman by her name, and showed her the earnest\r\nof the end of all sorrows. There were some people who cried, thinking of\r\nthe dead who were still waiting for Easter, which was more than anybody\r\ndid when Mr Wentworth discoursed upon the beautiful institutions of the\r\nChurch\'s year; and a great many of the congregation stayed to see Tom\r\nBurrows\'s six children come up for baptism, preceded by the new baby,\r\nwhose infant claims to Christianity the Curate had so strongly insisted\r\nupon, to the wakening of a fatherly conscience in the honest bargeman.\r\nLucy Wodehouse, without her grey cloak, stood at the font, holding that\r\nlast tiny applicant for saving grace, while all the other little\r\nheathens were signed with the sacred cross. And strangely enough, when\r\nthe young priest and the young woman stood so near each other, solemnly\r\npledging, one after another, each little sun-browned, round-eyed pagan\r\nto be Christ\'s faithful servant and soldier, the cloud passed away\r\nfrom the firmament of both. Neither of them, perhaps, was of a very\r\nenlightened character of soul. They believed they were doing a great\r\nwork for Tom Burrows\'s six children, calling God to His promise on their\r\nbehalf, and setting the little feet straight for the gates of the\r\neternal city; and in their young love and faith their hearts rose.\r\nPerhaps it was foolish of Mr Wentworth to suffer himself to walk home\r\nagain thereafter, as of old, with the Miss Wodehouses--but it was so\r\nusual, and, after all, they were going the same way. But it was a very\r\nsilent walk, to the wonder of the elder sister, who could not understand\r\nwhat it meant. "The Wharfside service always does me good," said Mr\r\nWentworth, with a sigh. "And me, too," said Lucy; and then they talked a\r\nlittle about the poor woman in No. 10. But that Easter Sunday was not\r\nlike other Sundays, though Miss Wodehouse could not tell why.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\nNext day the Miss Wentworths made a solemn call at the Rectory, having\r\nknown an aunt of Mrs Morgan at some period of their history, and being\r\nmuch disposed, besides, with natural curiosity, to ascertain all about\r\ntheir nephew\'s circumstances. Their entrance interrupted a consultation\r\nbetween the Rector and his wife. Mr Morgan was slightly heated, and had\r\nevidently been talking about something that excited him; while she, poor\r\nlady, looked just sufficiently sympathetic and indignant to withdraw\r\nher mind from that first idea which usually suggested itself on the\r\nentrance of visitors--which was, what could they possibly think of her\r\nif they supposed the carpet, &c., to be her own choice? Mrs Morgan cast\r\nher eye with a troubled look upon the big card which had been brought to\r\nher--Miss Wentworth, Miss Leonora Wentworth, Miss Dora Wentworth.\r\n"Sisters of his, I suppose, William," she said in an undertone; "now\r\n_do_ be civil, dear." There was no time for anything more before the\r\nthree ladies sailed in. Miss Leonora took the initiative, as was\r\nnatural.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t remember us, I daresay," she said, taking Mrs Morgan\'s\r\nhand; "we used to know your aunt Sidney, when she lived at the\r\nHermitage. Don\'t you recollect the Miss Wentworths of Skelmersdale?\r\nCharley Sidney spent part of his furlough with us last summer, and Ada\r\nwrites about you often. We could not be in Carlingford without coming\r\nto see the relation of such a dear friend."\r\n\r\n"I am so glad to see anybody who knows my aunt Sidney," said Mrs\r\nMorgan, with modified enthusiasm. "Mr Morgan, Miss Wentworth. It was\r\nsuch a dear little house that Hermitage. I spent some very happy days\r\nthere. Oh yes, I recollect Skelmersdale perfectly; but, to tell the\r\ntruth, there is one of the clergy in Carlingford called Wentworth, and\r\nI thought it might be some relations of his coming to call."\r\n\r\n"Just so," said Miss Wentworth, settling herself in the nearest\r\neasy-chair.\r\n\r\n"And so it is," cried Miss Dora; "we are his aunts, dear boy--we are\r\nvery fond of him. We came on purpose to see him. We are so glad to\r\nhear that he is liked in Carlingford."\r\n\r\n"Oh--yes," said the Rector\'s wife, and nobody else took any notice of\r\nMiss Dora\'s little outburst. As for Mr Morgan, he addressed Miss\r\nLeonora as if she had done something particularly naughty, and he had\r\na great mind to give her an imposition. "You have not been very long\r\nin Carlingford, I suppose," said the Rector, as if that were a sin.\r\n\r\n"Only since Saturday," said Miss Leonora. "We came to see Mr Frank\r\nWentworth, who is at St Roque\'s. I don\'t know what your bishop is\r\nabout, to permit all those flowers and candlesticks. For my part, I\r\nnever disguise my sentiments. I mean to tell my nephew plainly that\r\nhis way of conducting the service is far from being to my mind."\r\n\r\n"Leonora, dear, perhaps Mr Morgan would speak to Frank about it,"\r\ninterposed Miss Dora, anxiously; "he was always a dear boy, and advice\r\nwas never lost upon him. From one that he respected so much as he must\r\nrespect the Rector--"\r\n\r\n"I beg your pardon. I quite decline interfering with Mr Wentworth; he\r\nis not at all under my jurisdiction. Indeed," said the Rector, with a\r\nsmile of anger, "I might be more truly said to be under his, for he is\r\ngood enough to help in my parish without consulting me; but that is\r\nnot to the purpose. I would not for the world attempt to interfere\r\nwith St Roque\'s."\r\n\r\n"Dear, I am sure Mr Wentworth is very nice, and everything we have\r\nseen of him in private we have liked very much," said Mrs Morgan, with\r\nan anxious look at her husband. She was a good-natured woman, and the\r\nhandsome Curate had impressed her favourably, notwithstanding his\r\nmisdoings. "As for a little too much of the rubric, I think that is\r\nnot a bad fault in a young man. It gets softened down with a little\r\nexperience; and I do like proper solemnity in the services of the\r\nChurch."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t call intoning proper solemnity," said Miss Leonora. "The\r\nChurch is a missionary institution, that is my idea. Unless you are\r\nreally bringing in the perishing and saving souls, what is the good?\r\nand souls will never be saved by Easter decorations. I don\'t know what\r\nmy nephew may have done to offend you, Mr Morgan; but it is very sad\r\nto us, who have very strong convictions on the subject, to see him\r\nwasting his time so. I daresay there is plenty of heathenism in\r\nCarlingford which might be attacked in the first place."\r\n\r\n"I prefer not to discuss the subject," said the Rector. "So long as Mr\r\nWentworth, or any other clergyman, keeps to his own sphere of duty, I\r\nshould be the last in the world to interfere with him."\r\n\r\n"You are offended with Frank," said Miss Leonora, fixing her iron-grey\r\neyes upon Mr Morgan. "So am I; but I should be glad if you would tell\r\nme all about it. I have particular reasons for wishing to know. After\r\nall, he is only a young man," she continued, with that instinct of\r\nkindred which dislikes to hear censure from any lips but its own. "I\r\ndon\'t think there can be anything more than inadvertence in it. I\r\nshould be glad if you would tell me what you object to in him. I think\r\nit is probable that he may remain a long time in Carlingford," said\r\nMiss Leonora, with charming candour, "and it would be pleasant if we\r\ncould help to set him right. Your advice and experience might be of so\r\nmuch use to him." She was not aware of the covert sarcasm of her\r\nspeech. She did not know that the Rector\'s actual experience, though\r\nhe was half as old again as her nephew, bore no comparison to that of\r\nthe Perpetual Curate. She spoke in good faith and good nature, not\r\nmoved in her own convictions of what must be done in respect to\r\nSkelmersdale, but very willing, if that were possible, to do a good\r\nturn to Frank.\r\n\r\n"I am sure, dear, what we have seen of Mr Wentworth in private, we\r\nhave liked very much," said the Rector\'s sensible wife, with a\r\ndeprecating glance towards her husband. The Rector took no notice of\r\nthe glance; he grew slightly red in his serious middle-aged face, and\r\ncleared his throat several times before he began to speak.\r\n\r\n"The fact is, I have reason to be dissatisfied with Mr Wentworth, as\r\nregards my own parish," said Mr Morgan: "personally I have nothing to\r\nsay against him--quite the reverse; probably, as you say, it arises\r\nfrom inadvertence, as he is still a very young man; but--"\r\n\r\n"What has he done?" said Miss Leonora, pricking up her ears.\r\n\r\nOnce more Mr Morgan cleared his throat, but this time it was to keep\r\ndown the rising anger of which he was unpleasantly sensible. "I don\'t\r\ngenerally enter into such matters with people whom they don\'t concern,"\r\nhe said, with a touch of his natural asperity; "but as you are Mr\r\nWentworth\'s relation--. He has taken a step perfectly unjustifiable in\r\nevery respect; he has at the present moment a mission going on in my\r\nparish, in entire independence, I will not say defiance, of me. My\r\ndear, it is unnecessary to look at me so deprecatingly. I am indignant\r\nat having such a liberty taken with me. I don\'t pretend not to be\r\nindignant. Mr Wentworth is a very young man, and may not know any\r\nbetter; but it is the most unwarrantable intrusion upon a clergyman\'s\r\nrights. I beg your pardon, Miss Wentworth: you have nothing to do with\r\nmy grievances; but the fact is, my wife and I were discussing this very\r\nunpleasant matter when you came in."\r\n\r\n"A mission in your parish?" said Miss Leonora, her iron-grey eyes\r\nlighting up with a sparkle which did not look like indignation; at\r\nthis point it was necessary that Miss Dora should throw herself into\r\nthe breach.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr Morgan, I am sure my dear Frank does not mean it!" cried the\r\nunlucky peacemaker; "he would not for the world do anything to wound\r\nanybody\'s feelings--it must be a mistake."\r\n\r\n"Mr Morgan would not have mentioned it if we had not just been talking\r\nas you came in," said the Rector\'s wife, by way of smoothing down his\r\nruffled temper and giving him time to recover. "I feel _sure_ it is a\r\nmistake, and that everything will come right as soon as they can talk\r\nit over by themselves. The last Rector was not at all a working\r\nclergyman--and perhaps Mr Wentworth felt it was his duty--and now I\r\ndaresay he forgets that it is not his own parish. It will all come\r\nright after a time."\r\n\r\n"But the mission is effective, I suppose, or you would not object to\r\nit?" said Miss Leonora, who, though a very religious woman, was not a\r\npeacemaker; and the Rector, whose temper was hasty, swallowed the bait.\r\nHe entered into his grievances more fully than his wife thought\r\nconsistent with his dignity. She sat with her eyes fixed upon the floor,\r\ntracing the objectionable pattern on the carpet with her foot, but too\r\nmuch vexed for the moment to think of those bouquets which were so\r\nsevere a cross to her on ordinary occasions. Perhaps she was thinking\r\nsecretly to herself how much better one knows a man after being married\r\nto him three months than after being engaged to him ten years; but the\r\ndiscovery that he was merely a man after all, with very ordinary\r\ndefects, did not lessen her loyalty. She sat with her eyes bent upon the\r\ncarpet, feeling a little hot and uncomfortable as her husband disclosed\r\nhis weakness, and watching her opportunities to rush in and say a\r\nsoftening word now and then. The chances were, perhaps, on the whole,\r\nthat the wife grew _more_ loyal, if that were possible, as she perceived\r\nthe necessity of standing by him and backing him out. The Rector went\r\nvery fully into the subject, being drawn out by Miss Leonora\'s questions,\r\nand betrayed an extent of information strangely opposed to the utter\r\nignorance which he had displayed at Mr Wodehouse\'s party. He knew the\r\nhours of Mr Wentworth\'s services, and the number of people who attended,\r\nand even about Tom Burrows\'s six children who had been baptised the day\r\nbefore. Somehow Mr Morgan took this last particular as a special\r\noffence; it was this which had roused him beyond his usual self-control.\r\nSix little heathens brought into the Christian fold in his own parish\r\nwithout the permission of the Rector! It was indeed enough to try any\r\nclergyman\'s temper. Through the entire narrative Miss Dora broke in now\r\nand then with a little wail expressive of her general dismay and grief,\r\nand certainty that her dear Frank did not mean it. Mrs Morgan repeated\r\napart to Miss Wentworth with a troubled brow the fact that all they had\r\nseen of Mr Wentworth in private they had liked very much; to which aunt\r\nCecilia answered, "Quite so," with her beautiful smile; while Miss\r\nLeonora sat and listened, putting artful questions, and fixing the\r\nheated Rector with that iron-grey eye, out of which the sparkle of\r\nincipient light had not faded. Mr Morgan naturally said a great deal\r\nmore than he meant to say, and after it was said he was sorry; but he\r\ndid not show the latter sentiment except by silence and an uneasy\r\nrustling about the room just before the Miss Wentworths rose to go--a\r\nsign apparent to his wife, though to nobody else. He gave Miss Wentworth\r\nhis arm to the door with an embarrassed courtesy. "If you are going to\r\nstay any time at Carlingford, I trust we shall see more of you," said Mr\r\nMorgan: "I ought to beg your pardon for taking up so much time with my\r\naffairs;" and the Rector was much taken aback when Miss Wentworth\r\nanswered, "Thank you, that is just what I was thinking." He went back to\r\nhis troubled wife in great perplexity. What was it that was just what\r\nshe was thinking?--that he would see more of them, or that he had spoken\r\ntoo much of his own affairs?\r\n\r\n"You think I have been angry and made an idiot of myself," said Mr\r\nMorgan to his wife, who was standing looking from a safe distance\r\nthrough the curtains at the three ladies, who were holding a consultation\r\nwith their servant out of the window of the solemn chariot provided by\r\nthe Blue Boar, as to where they were to go next.\r\n\r\n"Nonsense, dear; but I wish you had not said quite so much about Mr\r\nWentworth," said the Rector\'s wife, seizing, with female art, on a cause\r\nfor her annoyance which would not wound her Welshman\'s _amour propre_,\r\n"for I rather think he is dependent on his aunts. They have the living\r\nof Skelmersdale, I know; and I remember now that their nephew was to\r\nhave had it. I hope this won\'t turn them against him, dear," said Mrs\r\nMorgan, who did not care the least in the world about Skelmersdale,\r\nlooking anxiously in her husband\'s face.\r\n\r\nThis was the climax of the Rector\'s trouble. "Why did not you tell me\r\nthat before?" he said, with conjugal injustice, and went off to his\r\nstudy with a disturbed mind, thinking that perhaps he had injured his\r\nown chances of getting rid of the Perpetual Curate. If Mrs Morgan had\r\npermitted herself to soliloquise after he was gone, the matter of her\r\nthoughts might have been interesting; but as neither ladies nor\r\ngentlemen in the nineteenth century are given to that useful medium of\r\ndisclosing their sentiments, the veil of privacy must remain over the\r\nmind of the Rector\'s wife. She got her gardening gloves and scissors,\r\nand went out immediately after, and had an animated discussion with the\r\ngardener about the best means of clothing that bit of wall, over which\r\nevery railway train was visible which left or entered Carlingford. That\r\nfunctionary was of opinion that when the lime-trees "growed a bit" all\r\nwould be right: but Mrs Morgan was reluctant to await the slow processes\r\nof nature. She forgot her vexations about Mr Wentworth in consideration\r\nof the still  more palpable inconvenience of the passing train.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Dora Wentworth relapsed into suppressed sobbing when the three\r\nladies were once more on their way. Between each little access a few\r\nbroken words fell from the poor lady\'s lips. "I am sure dear Frank did\r\nnot mean it," she said; it was all the plea his champion could find\r\nfor him.\r\n\r\n"He did not mean what? to do his duty and save souls?" said Miss\r\nLeonora--"is that what he didn\'t mean? It looks very much as if he\r\ndid, though--as well as he knew how."\r\n\r\n"Quite so, Leonora," said Miss Wentworth.\r\n\r\n"But he could not mean to vex the Rector," said Miss Dora--"my poor\r\ndear Frank: of course he meant it for the very best. I wonder you\r\ndon\'t think so, Leonora--you who are so fond of missions. I told you\r\nwhat I heard him saying to the young lady--all about the sick people\r\nhe was going to visit, and the children. He is a faithful shepherd,\r\nthough you won\'t think so; and I am sure he means nothing but--"\r\n\r\n"His duty, I think," said the iron-grey sister, resolutely indifferent\r\nto Miss Dora\'s little sniffs, and turning her gaze out of the window,\r\nunluckily just at the moment when the carriage was passing Masters\'s\r\nshop, where some engravings were hanging of a suspiciously devotional\r\ncharacter. The name over the door, and the aspect of the shop-window,\r\nwere terribly suggestive, and the fine profile of the Perpetual Curate\r\nwas just visible within to the keen eyes of his aunt. Miss Dora, for\r\nher part, dried hers, and, beginning to see some daylight, addressed\r\nherself anxiously to the task of obscuring it, and damaging once more\r\nher favourite\'s chance.\r\n\r\n"Ah, Leonora, if he had but a sphere of his own," cried Miss Dora,\r\n"where he would have other things to think of than the rubric, and\r\ndecorations, and sisterhoods! I don\'t wish any harm to poor dear old\r\nMr Shirley, I am sure; but when Frank is in the Rectory--"\r\n\r\n"I thought you understood that Frank would not do for the Rectory,"\r\nsaid Miss Leonora. "Sisterhoods!--look here, there\'s a young lady in a\r\ngrey cloak, and I think she\'s going into _that_ shop: if Frank carries\r\non that sort of thing, I shall think him a greater fool than ever. Who\r\nis that girl?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure I don\'t know, dear," said Miss Dora, with unexpected wisdom.\r\nAnd she comforted her conscience that she did not know, for she had\r\nforgotten Lucy\'s name. So there was no tangible evidence to confirm\r\nMiss Leonora\'s doubts, and the carriage from the Blue Boar rattled\r\ndown Prickett\'s Lane to the much amazement of that locality. When they\r\ngot to the grimy canal-banks, Miss Leonora stopped the vehicle and got\r\nout. She declined the attendance of her trembling sister, and marched\r\nalong the black pavement, dispersing with the great waves of her\r\ndrapery the wondering children about, who swarmed as children will\r\nswarm in such localities. Arrived at the schoolroom, Miss Leonora\r\nfound sundry written notices hung up in a little wooden frame inside\r\nthe open door. All sorts of charitable businesses were carried on\r\nabout the basement of the house; and a curt little notice about the\r\nProvident Society diversified the list of services which was hung up\r\nfor the advantage of the ignorant. Clearly the Curate of St Roque\'s\r\nmeant it. "As well as he knows how," his aunt allowed to herself, with\r\na softening sentiment; but, pushing her inquiries further, was shown\r\nup to the schoolroom, and stood pondering by the side of the\r\nreading-desk, looking at the table which was contrived to be so like\r\nan altar. The Curate, who could not have dreamed of such a visit, and\r\nwhose mind had been much occupied and indifferent to externals on the\r\nday before, had left various things lying about, which were carefully\r\ncollected for him upon a bench. Among them was a little pocket copy of\r\nThomas \xe0 Kempis, from which, when the jealous aunt opened it, certain\r\nlittle German prints, such as were to be had by the score at Masters\'s,\r\ndropped out, some of them unobjectionable enough. But if the Good\r\nShepherd could not be found fault with, the feelings of Miss Leonora may\r\nbe imagined when the meek face of a monkish saint, inscribed with some\r\nvillanous Latin inscription, a legend which began with the terrible\r\nwords _Ora pro nobis_, became suddenly visible to her troubled eyes. She\r\nput away the book as if it had stung her, and made a precipitate\r\nretreat. She shook her head as she descended the stair--she re-entered\r\nthe carriage in gloomy silence. When it returned up Prickett\'s Lane, the\r\nthree ladies again saw their nephew, this time entering the door of No.\r\n10. He had his prayer-book under his arm, and Miss Leonora seized upon\r\nthis professional symbol to wreak her wrath upon it. "I wonder if he\r\ncan\'t pray by a sick woman without his prayer-book?" she cried. "I never\r\nwas so provoked in my life. How is it he doesn\'t know better? His father\r\nis not pious, but he isn\'t a Puseyite, and old uncle Wentworth was very\r\nsound--he was brought up under the pure Gospel. How is that the boys are\r\nso foolish, Dora?" said Miss Leonora, sharply; "it must be your doing.\r\nYou have told them tales and things, and put true piety out of their\r\nhead."\r\n\r\n"My doing!" said Miss Dora, faintly; but she was too much startled by\r\nthe suddenness of the attack to make any coherent remonstrance. Miss\r\nLeonora tossed back her angry head, and pursued that inspiration,\r\nfinding it a relief in her perplexity.\r\n\r\n"It must be _all_ your doing," she said. "How can I tell that you are\r\nnot a Jesuit in disguise? one has read of such a thing. The boys were\r\nas good, nice, pious boys as one could wish to see; and there\'s Gerald\r\non the point of perversion, and Frank--I tell you, Dora, it must be\r\nyour fault."\r\n\r\n"That was always my opinion," said Miss Cecilia; and the accused,\r\nafter a feeble attempt at speech, could find nothing better to do than\r\nto drop her veil once more and cry under it. It was very hard, but she\r\nwas not quite unaccustomed to it. However, the discoveries of the day\r\nwere important enough to prevent the immediate departure which Miss\r\nLeonora had intended. She wrote a note with her own hands to her\r\nnephew, asking him to dinner. "We meant to have gone away to-day, but\r\nshould like to see you first," she said in her note. "Come and\r\ndine--we mayn\'t have anything pleasant to say, but I don\'t suppose you\r\nexpect that. It\'s a pity we don\'t see eye to eye." Such was the\r\nintimation received by Mr Wentworth when he got home, very tired, in\r\nthe afternoon. He had been asking himself whether, under the\r\ncircumstances, it would not be proper of him to return some books of\r\nMr Wodehouse\'s which he had in his possession, of course by way of\r\nbreaking off his too familiar, too frequent intercourse. He had been\r\nrepresenting to himself that he would make this call after their\r\ndinner would be over, at the hour when Mr Wodehouse reposed in his\r\neasy-chair, and the two sisters were generally to be found alone in\r\nthe drawing-room. Perhaps he might have an opportunity of intimating\r\nthe partial farewell he meant to take of them. When he got Miss\r\nLeonora\'s note, the Curate\'s countenance clouded over. He said,\r\n"Another night lost," with indignant candour. It was hard enough to\r\ngive up his worldly prospects, but he thought he had made up his mind\r\nto that. However, refusal was impossible. It was still daylight when\r\nhe went up Grange Lane to the Blue Boar. He was early, and went\r\nlanguidly along the well-known road. Nobody was about at that hour. In\r\nthose closed, embowered houses, people were preparing for dinner, the\r\ngreat event of the day, and Mr Wentworth was aware of that. Perhaps he\r\nhad expected to see somebody--Mr Wodehouse going home, most likely, in\r\norder that he might mention his own engagement, and account for his\r\nfailure in the chance evening call which had become so much a part of\r\nhis life. But no one appeared to bear his message. He went lingering\r\npast the green door, and up the silent deserted road. At the end of\r\nGrange Lane, just in the little unsettled transition interval which\r\ninterposed between its aristocratic calm and the bustle of George\r\nStreet, on the side next Prickett\'s Lane, was a quaint little shop,\r\ninto which Mr Wentworth strayed to occupy the time. This was\r\nElsworthy\'s, who, as is well known, was then clerk at St Roque\'s.\r\nElsworthy himself was in his shop that Easter Monday, and so was his\r\nwife and little Rosa, who was a little beauty. Rosa and her aunt had\r\njust returned from an excursion, and a prettier little apparition\r\ncould not be seen than that dimpled rosy creature, with her radiant\r\nhalf-childish looks, her bright eyes, and soft curls of dark-brown\r\nhair. Even Mr Wentworth gave a second glance at her as he dropped\r\nlanguidly into a chair, and asked Elsworthy if there was any news. Mrs\r\nElsworthy, who had been telling the adventures of the holiday to her\r\ngoodman, gathered up her basket of eggs and her nosegay, and made the\r\nclergyman a little curtsy as she hurried away; for the clerk\'s wife\r\nwas a highly respectable woman, and knew her own place. But Rosa, who\r\nwas only a kind of kitten, and had privileges, stayed. Mr Wentworth\r\nwas by far the most magnificent figure she had ever seen in her little\r\nlife. She looked at him with awe out of her bright eyes, and thought\r\nhe looked like the prince in the fairy tales.\r\n\r\n"Any news, sir? There aint much to call news, sir--not in a place like\r\nthis," said Mr Elsworthy. "Your respected aunts, sir, \'as been down at\r\nthe schoolroom. I haven\'t heard anything else as I could suppose you\r\ndidn\'t know."\r\n\r\n"My aunts!" cried the Curate; "how do you know anything about my\r\naunts?" Mr Elsworthy smiled a complacent and familiar smile.\r\n\r\n"There\'s so many a-coming and a-going here that I know most persons as\r\ncomes into Carlingford," said he; "and them three respected ladies is\r\nas good as a pictur. I saw them a-driving past and down Prickett\'s\r\nLane. They was as anxious to know all about it as--as was to be\r\nexpected in the circumstances," said Mr Elsworthy, failing of a\r\nmetaphor; "and I wish you your \'ealth and \'appiness, sir, if all as I\r\nhear is true."\r\n\r\n"It\'s a good wish," said the Curate; "thank you, Elsworthy; but what\r\nyou heard might not be true."\r\n\r\n"Well, sir, it looks more than likely," said the clerk; "as far as\r\nI\'ve seen in my experience, ladies don\'t go inquiring into a young\r\ngentleman\'s ways, not without some reason. If they was young ladies, and\r\nnoways related, we know what we\'d think, sir; but being old ladies, and\r\naunts, it\'s equally as clear. For my part, Mr Wentworth, my worst wish\r\nis, that when you come into your fortune, it mayn\'t lead you away from\r\nSt Roque\'s--not after everything is settled so beautiful, and not a\r\nthing wanted but some stained glass, as I hear a deal of people say, to\r\nmake it as perfect a little church--"\r\n\r\n"Yes, it is very true; a painted window is very much wanted," said Mr\r\nWentworth, thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps there\'s one o\' the ladies, sir, as has some friend she\'d like\r\nto put up a memorial to," said Mr Elsworthy, in insinuating tones. "A\r\nwindow is a deal cheerfuller a memorial than a tombstone, and it\r\ncouldn\'t be described the improvement it would be to the church. I\'m\r\nsorry to hear Mr Wodehouse aint quite so well as his usual to-night; a\r\nuseful man like he is, would be a terrible loss to Carlingford; not as\r\nit\'s anything alarming, as far as I can hear, but being a stout man,\r\nit aint a safe thing his being took so sudden. I\'ve heard the old\r\ndoctor say, sir, as a man of a full \'abit might be took off at once,\r\nwhen a spare man would fight through. It would be a sad thing for his\r\nfamily, sir," said Mr Elsworthy, tying up a bundle of newspapers with\r\na very serious face.\r\n\r\n"Good heavens, Elsworthy, how you talk!" said the alarmed Curate. "What\r\ndo you mean?--is Mr Wodehouse ill?--seriously ill?"\r\n\r\n"Not serious, as I knows of," said the clerk, with solemnity; "but\r\nbeing a man of a full \'abit of body--I daresay as the town would enter\r\ninto it by subscription if it was proposed as a memorial to _him_, for\r\nhe\'s much respected in Carlingford is Mr Wodehouse. I see him a-going\r\npast, sir, at five o\'clock, which is an hour earlier than common, and\r\nhe was looking flabby, that\'s how he was looking. I don\'t know a man\r\nas would be a greater loss to his family; and they aint been without\r\ntheir troubles either, poor souls."\r\n\r\n"I should be sorry to think that it was necessary to sacrifice Mr\r\nWodehouse for the sake of our painted window," said the Curate, "as\r\nthat seems what you mean. Send over this note for me please, as I have\r\nnot time to call. No, certainly, don\'t send Rosa; that child is too\r\nyoung and too--too pretty to be out by herself at night. Send a boy.\r\nHaven\'t you got a boy?--there is a very nice little fellow that I\r\ncould recommend to you," said Mr Wentworth, as he hastily scribbled\r\nhis note with a pencil, "whose mother lives in Prickett\'s Lane."\r\n\r\n"Thank _you_, sir, all the same; but I hope I don\'t need to go into\r\nthat neighbourhood for good service," said Mr Elsworthy: "as for Rosa,\r\nI could trust her anywhere; and I have a boy, sir, as is the best boy\r\nthat ever lived--a real English boy, that is. Sam, take this to Mr\r\nWodehouse\'s directly, and wait for an answer. No answer?--very well,\r\nsir. You needn\'t wait for no answer, Sam. That\'s a boy, sir, I could\r\ntrust with untold gold. His mother\'s a Dissenter, it is true, but the\r\nprinciples of that boy is beautiful. I hope you haven\'t mentioned,\r\nsir, as I said Mr Wodehouse was took bad? It was between ourselves, Mr\r\nWentworth. Persons don\'t like, especially when they\'ve got to that\r\nage, and are of a full \'abit of body, to have every little attack made\r\na talk about. You\'ll excuse me mentioning it, sir, but it was as\r\nbetween ourselves."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you\'d like me to show you my note," said the Curate, with a\r\nsmile; which, indeed, Elsworthy would have very much liked, could he\r\nhave ventured to say so. Mr Wentworth was but too glad of an excuse to\r\nwrite and explain his absence. The note was not to Lucy, however,\r\nthough various little epistles full of the business of the district\r\nhad passed between the two:--\r\n\r\n\r\n "DEAR MISS W.,--I hear your father is not quite well. I can\'t call\r\n just now, as I am going to dine with my aunts, who are at the Blue\r\n Boar; but, if you will pardon the lateness of the hour, I will call as\r\n I return to ask for him.--Ever yours,\r\n\r\n "F. C. WENTWORTH."\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch was the Curate\'s note. While he scribbled it, little Rosa stood\r\napart watching him with admiring eyes. He had said she was too pretty\r\nto be sent across Grange Lane by herself at this hour, though it was\r\nstill no more than twilight; and he looked up at her for an instant as\r\nhe said the words,--quite enough to set Rosa\'s poor little heart\r\nbeating with childish romantical excitement. If she could but have\r\npeeped into the note to see what he said!--for perhaps, after all,\r\nthere might not be anything "between" him and Miss Lucy--and perhaps--\r\nThe poor little thing stood watching, deaf to her aunt\'s call, looking\r\nat the strange ease with which that small epistle was written, and\r\nthinking it half divine to have such mastery of words and pen. Mr\r\nWentworth threw it to Sam as if it were a trifle; but Rosa\'s lively\r\nimagination could already conceive the possibility of living upon such\r\ntrifles and making existence out of them; so the child stood with her\r\npretty curls about her ears, and her bright eyes gleaming dewy over\r\nthe fair, flushed, rosebud cheeks, in a flutter of roused and innocent\r\nimagination anticipating her fate. As for Mr Wentworth, it is doubtful\r\nwhether he saw Rosa, as he swung himself round upon the stool he was\r\nseated on, and turned his face towards the door. Somehow he was\r\ncomforted in his mind by the conviction that it was his duty to call\r\nat Mr Wodehouse\'s as he came back. The evening brightened up and\r\nlooked less dismal. The illness of the respected father of the house\r\ndid not oppress the young man. He thought not of the sick-room, but of\r\nthe low chair in one corner, beside the work-table where Lucy had\r\nalways basketfuls of sewing in hand. He could fancy he saw the work\r\ndrop on her knee, and the blue eyes raised. It was a pretty picture\r\nthat he framed for himself as he looked out with a half smile into the\r\nblue twilight through the open door of Elsworthy\'s shop. And it was\r\nclearly his duty to call. He grew almost jocular in the exhilaration\r\nof his spirits.\r\n\r\n"The Miss Wentworths don\'t approve of memorial windows, Elsworthy," he\r\nsaid; "and, indeed, if you think it necessary to cut off one of the\r\nchief people in Carlingford by way of supplying St Roque\'s with a\r\nlittle painted glass--"\r\n\r\n"No, sir--no, no, sir; you\'re too hard upon me--there wasn\'t no such\r\nmeaning in my mind; but I don\'t make no question the ladies were\r\npleased with the church," said Elsworthy, with the satisfaction of a\r\nman who had helped to produce an entirely triumphant effect. "I don\'t\r\npretend to be a judge myself of what you call \'igh art, Mr Wentworth;\r\nbut if I might venture an opinion, the altar was beautiful; and we\r\nwon\'t say nothing about the service, considering, sir--if you won\'t be\r\noffended at putting them together, as one is so far inferior--that\r\nboth you and me--"\r\n\r\nMr Wentworth laughed and moved off his chair. "We were not appreciated\r\nin this instance," he said, with an odd comic look, and then went off\r\ninto a burst of laughter, which Mr Elsworthy saw no particular\r\noccasion for. Then he took up his glove, which he had taken off to\r\nwrite the note, and, nodding a kindly good-night to little Rosa, who\r\nstood gazing after him with all her eyes, went away to the Blue Boar.\r\nThe idea, however, of his own joint performance with Mr Elsworthy not\r\nonly tickled the Curate, but gave him a half-ashamed sense of the\r\naspect in which he might himself appear to the eyes of matter-of-fact\r\npeople who differed with him. The joke had a slight sting, which\r\nbrought his laughter to an end. He went up through the lighted street\r\nto the inn, wishing the dinner over, and himself on his way back again\r\nto call at Mr Wodehouse\'s. For, to tell the truth, by this time he had\r\nalmost exhausted Skelmersdale, and, feeling in himself not much\r\ndifferent now from what he was when his hopes were still green, had\r\nbegun to look upon life itself with a less troubled eye, and to\r\nbelieve in other chances which might make Lucy\'s society practicable\r\nonce more. It was in this altered state of mind that he presented\r\nhimself before his aunts. He was less self-conscious, less watchful,\r\nmore ready to amuse them, if that might happen to be possible, and in\r\nreality much more able to cope with Miss Leonora than when he had been\r\nmore anxious about her opinion. He had not been two minutes in the\r\nroom before all the three ladies perceived this revolution, and each\r\nin her own mind attempted to account for it. They were experienced\r\nwomen in their way, and found a variety of reasons; but as none of\r\nthem were young, and as people _will_ forget how youth feels, not one\r\nof them divined the fact that there was no reason, but that this\r\nimprovement of spirits arose solely from the fact that the Perpetual\r\nCurate had been for two whole days miserable about Skelmersdale, and\r\nhad exhausted all his powers of misery--and that now youth had turned\r\nthe tables, and he was still to see Lucy tonight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\n"Your Rector is angry at some of your proceedings," said Miss Leonora.\r\n"I did not think a man of your views would have cared for missionary\r\nwork. I should have supposed that you would think that vulgar, and\r\nLow-Church, and Evangelical. Indeed, I thought I heard you say you\r\ndidn\'t believe in preaching, Frank?--neither do I, when a man preaches\r\nthe Tracts for the Times. I was surprised to hear what you were doing\r\nat the place they call Wharfside."\r\n\r\n"First let me correct you in two little inaccuracies," said Mr Wentworth,\r\nblandly, as he peeled his orange. "The Rector of Carlingford is not _my_\r\nrector, and I don\'t preach the Tracts for the Times. Let us always be\r\nparticular, my dear aunt, as to points of fact."\r\n\r\n"Exactly so," said Miss Leonora, grimly; "but, at the same time, as\r\nthere seems no great likelihood of your leaving Carlingford, don\'t you\r\nthink it would be wise to cultivate friendly relations with the Rector?"\r\nsaid the iron-grey inexorable aunt, looking full in his eyes as she\r\nspoke. So significant and plain a statement took for an instant the\r\ncolour out of the Curate\'s cheeks--he pared his orange very carefully\r\nwhile he regained his composure, and it was at least half a minute\r\nbefore he found himself at leisure to reply. Miss Dora of course seized\r\nupon the opportunity, and, by way of softening matters, interposed in\r\nher unlucky person to make peace.\r\n\r\n"But, my dear boy, I said I was sure you did not mean it," said Miss\r\nDora; "I told Mr Morgan I felt convinced it could be explained. Nobody\r\nknows you so well as I do. You were always high-spirited from a child,\r\nand never would give in; but I know very well you never could mean it,\r\nFrank."\r\n\r\n"Mean it?" said the Curate, with sparkling eyes: "what do you take me\r\nfor, aunt Dora? Do you know what it is we are talking of? The question\r\nis, whether a whole lot of people, fathers and children, shall be left\r\nto live like beasts, without reverence for God or man, or shall be\r\nbrought within the pale of the Church, and taught their duty? And you\r\nthink I don\'t mean it? I mean it as much as my brother Charley meant it\r\nat the Redan," said young Wentworth, with a glow of suppressed enthusiasm,\r\nand that natural pride in Charley (who got the Cross for valour) which\r\nwas common to all the Wentworths. But when he saw his aunt Leonora\r\nlooking at him, the Perpetual Curate stood to his arms again. "I have\r\nstill to learn that the Rector has anything to do with it," said the\r\nyoung Evangelist of Wharfside.\r\n\r\n"It is in his parish, and he thinks he has," said Miss Leonora. "I wish\r\nyou could see your duty more clearly, Frank. You seem to me, you know,\r\nto have a kind of zeal, but not according to knowledge. If you were\r\ncarrying the real Gospel to the poor people, I shouldn\'t be disposed to\r\nblame you; for the limits of a parish are but poor things to pause for\r\nwhen souls are perishing; but to break the law for the sake of diffusing\r\nthe rubric and propagating Tractarianism--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Leonora, how can you be so harsh and cruel?" cried Miss Dora;\r\n"only think what you are doing. I don\'t say anything about\r\ndisappointing Frank, and perhaps injuring his prospects for life; for,\r\nto be sure, he is a true Wentworth, and won\'t acknowledge that; but\r\nthink of my poor dear brother, with so many sons as he has to provide\r\nfor, and so much on his mind; and think of ourselves and all that we\r\nhave planned so often. Only think what you have talked of over and\r\nover; how nice it would be when he was old enough to take the Rectory,\r\nand marry Julia Trench--"\r\n\r\n"Aunt Dora," said the Curate, rising from the table. "I shall have to\r\ngo away if you make such appeals on my behalf. And besides, it is only\r\nright to tell you that, whatever my circumstances were, I never could\r\nnor would marry Julia Trench. It is cruel and unjust to bring in her\r\nname. Don\'t let us hear any more of this, if you have any regard for\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"Quite so, Frank," said Miss Wentworth; "that is exactly what I was\r\nthinking." Miss Cecilia was not in the habit of making demonstrations,\r\nbut she put out her delicate old hand to point her nephew to his seat\r\nagain, and gave a soft slight pressure to his as she touched it. Old\r\nMiss Wentworth was a kind of dumb lovely idol to her nephews; she\r\nrarely said anything to them, but they worshipped her all the same for\r\nher beauty and those languid tendernesses which she showed them once\r\nin ten years or so. The Perpetual Curate was much touched by this\r\nmanifestation. He kissed his old aunt\'s beautiful hand as reverently\r\nas if it had been a saint\'s. "I knew you would understand me," he\r\nsaid, looking gratefully at her lovely old face; which exclamation,\r\nhowever, was a simple utterance of gratitude, and would not have borne\r\ninvestigation. When he had resumed his seat and his orange, Miss\r\nLeonora cleared her throat for a grand address.\r\n\r\n"Frank might as well tell us he would not have Skelmersdale," she\r\nsaid. "Julia Trench has quite other prospects, I am glad to say,\r\nthough Dora talks like a fool on this subject as well as on many\r\nothers. Mr Shirley is not dead yet, and I don\'t think he means to die,\r\nfor my part; and Julia would never leave her uncle. Besides, I don\'t\r\nthink any inducement in the world would make her disguise herself like\r\na Sister of Mercy. I hope she knows better. And it is a pity that\r\nFrank should learn to think of Skelmersdale as if it were a family\r\nliving," continued Miss Leonora. "For my part, I think people\r\ndetached from immediate ties as we are, are under all the greater\r\nresponsibility. But as you are likely to stay in Carlingford, Frank,\r\nperhaps we could help you with the Rector," she concluded blandly, as\r\nshe ate her biscuit. The Curate, who was also a Wentworth, had quite\r\nrecovered himself ere this speech was over, and proved himself equal\r\nto the occasion.\r\n\r\n"If the Rector objects to what I am doing, I daresay he will tell me\r\nof it," said Mr Wentworth, with indescribable suavity. "I had the\r\nconsent of the two former rectors to my mission in their parish, and I\r\ndon\'t mean to give up such a work without a cause. But I am equally\r\nobliged to you, my dear aunt, and I hope Mr Shirley will live for ever.\r\nHow long are you going to stay in Carlingford? Some of the people would\r\nlike to call on you, if you remain longer. There are some great friends\r\nof mine here; and as I have every prospect of being perpetually the\r\nCurate, as you kindly observe, perhaps it might be good for me if I\r\nwas seen to have such unexceptionable relationships--"\r\n\r\n"Satire is lost upon me," said Miss Leonora, "and we are going\r\nto-morrow. Here comes the coffee. I did not think it had been so late.\r\nWe shall leave by an early train, and you can come and see us off, if\r\nyou have time."\r\n\r\n"I shall certainly find time," said the nephew, with equal politeness;\r\n"and now you will permit me to say good-night, for I have a--one of my\r\nsick people to visit. I heard he was ill only as I came here, and had\r\nnot time to call," added the Curate, with unnecessary explanitoriness,\r\nand took leave of his aunt Cecilia, who softly put something into his\r\nhand as she bade him good-night. Miss Dora, for her part, went with\r\nhim to the door, and lingered leaning on his arm, down the long\r\npassage, all unaware, poor lady, that his heart was beating with\r\nimpatience to get away, and that the disappointment for which she\r\nwanted to console him had at the present moment not the slightest real\r\nhold upon his perverse heart. "Oh, my dear boy, I hope you don\'t think\r\nit\'s my fault," said Miss Dora, with tears. "It must have come to\r\nthis, dear, sooner or later: you see, poor Leonora has such a sense of\r\nresponsibility; but it is very hard upon us, Frank, who love you so\r\nmuch, that she should always take her own way."\r\n\r\n"Then why don\'t you rebel?" said the Curate, who, in the thought of\r\nseeing Lucy, was exhilarated, and dared to jest even upon the awful\r\npower of his aunt. "You are two against one; why don\'t you take it\r\ninto your own hands and rebel?"\r\n\r\nMiss Dora repeated the words with an alarmed quiver. "Rebel! oh,\r\nFrank, dear, do you think we could? To be sure, we are co-heiresses,\r\nand have just as good a right as she has; and for your sake, my dear\r\nboy," said the troubled woman, "oh, Frank, I wish you would tell me\r\nwhat to do! I never should dare to contradict Leonora with no one to\r\nstand by me; and then, if anything happened, you would all think I had\r\nbeen to blame," said poor aunt Dora, clinging to his arm. She made him\r\nwalk back and back again through the long passage, which was sacred to\r\nthe chief suite of apartments at the Blue Boar. "We have it all to\r\nourselves, and nobody can see us here; and oh, my dear boy, if you\r\nwould only tell me what I ought to do?" she repeated, with wistful\r\nlooks of appeal. Mr Wentworth was too good-hearted to show the\r\nimpatience with which he was struggling. He satisfied her as well as\r\nhe could, and said good-night half-a-dozen times. When he made his\r\nescape at last, and emerged into the clear blue air of the spring\r\nnight, the Perpetual Curate had no such sense of disappointment and\r\nfailure in his mind as the three ladies supposed. Miss Leonora\'s\r\ndistinct intimation that Skelmersdale had passed out of the region of\r\nprobabilities, had indeed tingled through him at the moment it was\r\nuttered; but just now he was going to see Lucy, anticipating with\r\nimpatience the moment of coming into her presence, and nothing in the\r\nworld could have dismayed him utterly. He went down the road very\r\nrapidly, glad to find that it was still so early, that the shopkeepers\r\nin George Street were but just putting up their shutters, and that\r\nthere was still time for an hour\'s talk in that bright drawing-room.\r\nLittle Rosa was standing at the door of Elsworthy\'s shop, looking out\r\ninto the dark street as he passed; and he said, "A lovely night,\r\nRosa," as he went by. But the night was nothing particular in itself,\r\nonly lovely to Mr Wentworth, as embellished with Lucy shining over it,\r\nlike a distant star. Perhaps he had never in his life felt so glad\r\nthat he was going to see her, so eager for her presence, as that night\r\nwhich was the beginning of the time when it would be no longer lawful\r\nfor him to indulge in her society. He heaved a big sigh as that\r\nthought occurred to him, but it did not diminish the flush of\r\nconscious happiness; and in this mood he went down Grange Lane, with\r\nlight resounding steps, to Mr Wodehouse\'s door.\r\n\r\nBut Mr Wentworth started with a very strange sensation when the door\r\nwas stealthily, noiselessly opened to him before he could ring. He\r\ncould not see who it was that called him in the darkness; but he felt\r\nthat he had been watched for, and that the door was thrown open very\r\nhurriedly to prevent him from making his usual summons at the bell.\r\nSuch an incident was incomprehensible. He went into the dark garden\r\nlike a man in a dream, with a horrible vision of Archimage and the\r\nfalse Una somehow stealing upon his mind, he could not tell how. It\r\nwas quite dark inside, for the moon was late of rising that night, and\r\nthe faint stars threw no effectual lustre down upon the trees. He had\r\nto grope before him to know where he was going, asking in a troubled\r\nvoice, "Who is there? What is the matter?" and falling into more and\r\nmore profound bewilderment and uneasiness.\r\n\r\n"Hush, hush, oh hush!--Oh, Mr Wentworth, it is I--I want to speak to\r\nyou," said an agitated voice beside him. "Come this way--this way; I\r\ndon\'t want any one to hear us." It was Miss Wodehouse who thus pitifully\r\naddressed the amazed Curate. She laid a tremulous hand on his arm, and\r\ndrew him deeper into the shadows--into that walk where the limes and\r\ntall lilac-bushes grew so thickly. Here she came to a pause, and the\r\nsound of the terrified panting breath in the silence alarmed him more\r\nand more.\r\n\r\n"Is Mr Wodehouse ill? What has happened?" said the astonished young\r\nman. The windows of the house were gleaming hospitably over the dark\r\ngarden, without any appearance of gloom--the drawing-room windows\r\nespecially, which he knew so well, brightly lighted, one of them open,\r\nand the sound of the piano and Lucy\'s voice stealing out like a\r\ncelestial reality into the darkness. By the time he had become fully\r\nsensible of all these particulars his agitated companion had found her\r\nbreath.\r\n\r\n"Mr Wentworth, don\'t think me mad," said Miss Wodehouse; "I have come\r\nout to speak to you, for I am in great distress. I don\'t know what to\r\ndo unless you will help me. Oh no, don\'t look at the house--nobody\r\nknows in the house; I would die rather than have them know. Hush,\r\nhush! don\'t make any noise. Is that some one looking out at the door?"\r\n\r\nAnd just then the door was opened, and Mr Wodehouse\'s sole male\r\nservant looked out, and round the garden, as if he had heard something\r\nto excite his curiosity or surprise. Miss Wodehouse grasped the arm of\r\nthe Perpetual Curate, and held him with an energy which was almost\r\nviolence. "Hush, hush, hush," she said, with her voice almost at his\r\near. The excitement of this mild woman, the perfectly inexplicable\r\nmystery of the meeting, overwhelmed young Wentworth. He could think of\r\nnothing less than that she had lost her senses, and in his turn he\r\ntook her hands and held her fast.\r\n\r\n"What is the matter? I cannot tell you how anxious, how distressed I\r\nam. What has happened?" said the young man, under his breath.\r\n\r\n"My father has some suspicion," she answered, after a pause--"he came\r\nhome early to-day looking ill. You heard of it, Mr Wentworth--it was\r\nyour note that decided me. Oh, heaven help us! it is so hard to know\r\nwhat to do. I have never been used to act for myself, and I feel as\r\nhelpless as a baby. The only comfort I have was that it happened on\r\nEaster Sunday," said the poor gentlewoman, incoherently; "and oh! if\r\nit should prove a rising from the dead! If you saw me, Mr Wentworth,\r\nyou would see I look ten years older; and I can\'t tell you how it is,\r\nbut I think my father has suspicions;--he looked so ill--oh, so\r\nill--when he came home to-night. Hush! hush! did you hear anything? I\r\ndaren\'t tell Lucy; not that I couldn\'t trust her, but it is cruel when\r\na young creature is happy, to let her know such miseries. Oh, Mr\r\nWentworth, I daresay I am not telling you what it is, after all. I\r\ndon\'t know what I am saying--wait till I can think. It was on Easter\r\nSunday, after we came home from Wharfside; you remember we all came\r\nhome together, and both Lucy and you were so quiet. I could not\r\nunderstand how it was you were so quiet, but I was not thinking of any\r\ntrouble--and then all at once there he was."\r\n\r\n"Who?" said the Curate, forgetting caution in his bewilderment.\r\n\r\nOnce more the door opened, and John appeared on the steps, this time\r\nwith a lantern and the watch-dog, a great brown mastiff, by his side,\r\nevidently with the intention of searching the garden for the owners of\r\nthose furtive voices. Mr Wentworth drew the arm of his trembling\r\ncompanion within his own. "I don\'t know what you want of me, but\r\nwhatever it is, trust to me like--like a brother," he said, with a sigh.\r\n"But now compose yourself; we must go into the house: it will not do for\r\nyou to be found here." He led her up the gravel-walk into the light of\r\nthe lantern, which the vigilant guardian of the house was flashing among\r\nthe bushes as he set out upon his rounds. John fell back amazed but\r\nrespectful when he saw his mistress and the familiar visitor. "Beg your\r\npardon, ma\'am, but I knew there was voices, and I didn\'t know as any of\r\nthe family was in the garden," said the man, discomfited. It was all Mr\r\nWentworth could do to hold up the trembling figure by his side. As John\r\nretreated, she gathered a little fortitude. Perhaps it was easier for\r\nher to tell her hurried tremulous story, as he guided _her_ back to the\r\nhouse, than it would have been in uninterrupted leisure and quiet. The\r\nfamily tragedy fell in broken sentences from her lips, as the Curate\r\nbent down his astonished ear to listen. He was totally unprepared for\r\nthe secret which only her helplessness and weakness and anxiety to serve\r\nher father could have drawn from Miss Wodehouse\'s lips; and it had to be\r\ntold so hurriedly that Mr Wentworth scarcely knew what it was, except a\r\nterrible unsuspected shadow overhanging the powerful house, until he had\r\ntime to think it all over. There was no such time at this moment. His\r\ntrembling companion left him as soon as they reached the house, to\r\n"compose herself," as she said. When he saw her face in the light of the\r\nhall lamp it was ghastly, and quivering with agitation, looking not ten\r\nyears, as she said, but a hundred years older than when, in the sweet\r\nprecision of her Sunday dress and looks, old Miss Wodehouse had bidden\r\nhim good-bye at the green door. He went up to the drawing-room,\r\nnotwithstanding, with as calm a countenance as he himself could collect,\r\nto pay the visit which, in this few minutes, had so entirely changed in\r\ncharacter. Mr Wentworth felt as if he saw everything exactly as he had\r\npictured it to himself half an hour ago. Lucy, who had left the piano,\r\nwas seated in her low chair again, not working, but talking to Mr\r\nWodehouse, who lay on the sofa, looking a trifle less rosy than usual,\r\nlike a man who had had a fright, or been startled by some possible\r\nshadow of a ghost. To walk into the room, into the bright household\r\nglow, and smile and shake hands with them, feeling all the time that he\r\nknew more about them than they themselves did, was the strangest\r\nsensation to the young man. He asked how Mr Wodehouse did, with a voice\r\nwhich, to himself, sounded hollow and unnatural, and sat down beside the\r\ninvalid, almost turning his back upon Lucy in his bewilderment. It was\r\nindeed with a great effort that Mr Wentworth mastered himself, and was\r\nable to listen to what his companion said.\r\n\r\n"We are all right," said Mr Wodehouse--"a trifle of a headache or\r\nso--nothing to make a talk about; but Molly has forsaken us, and we\r\nwere just about getting bored with each other, Lucy and I; a third\r\nperson was all we wanted to make us happy--eh? Well I thought you\r\nlooked at the door very often--perhaps I was mistaken--but I could\r\nhave sworn you were listening and looking for somebody. No wonder\r\neither--I don\'t think so. I should have done just the same at your\r\nage."\r\n\r\n"Indeed, papa, you are quite mistaken," said Lucy. "I suppose that means\r\nthat I cannot amuse you by myself, though I have been trying all the\r\nevening. Perhaps Mr Wentworth will be more fortunate." And, either for\r\nshame of being supposed to look for him, or in a little innocent pique,\r\nshe moved away from where she was sitting, and rang for tea, and left\r\nthe two gentlemen to talk to each other. That is to say, Mr Wodehouse\r\ntalked, and the Perpetual Curate sat looking vaguely at the fair figure\r\nwhich flitted about the room, and wondering if he were awake, or the\r\nworld still in its usual place. After a while Miss Wodehouse came in,\r\nvery tremulous and pale, and dropped into the first chair she could\r\nfind, and pretended to occupy herself over her knitting. She had a\r\nheadache, Lucy said; and Mr Wentworth sat watching while the younger\r\nsister tended the elder, bringing her tea, kissing her, persuading her\r\nto go and lie down, taking all kinds of affectionate trouble to cheer\r\nthe pale woman, who looked over Lucy\'s fair head with eyes full of\r\nmeaning to the bewildered visitor, who was the only one there who\r\nunderstood what her trouble meant. When he got up to go away, she wrung\r\nhis hand with a pitiful gaze which went to his heart. "Let me know!" she\r\nsaid in a whisper; and, not satisfied still, went to the door with him,\r\nand lingered upon the stair, following slowly. "Oh, Mr Wentworth! be\r\nsure you let me know," she repeated, again looking wistfully after him\r\nas he disappeared into the dark garden, going out. The stars were still\r\nshining, the spring dews lying sweet upon the plants and turf. It was a\r\nlovelier night now than when Mr Wentworth had said so to little Rosa\r\nElsworthy an hour ago; but mists were rising from the earth, and clouds\r\ncreeping over the sky, to the startled imagination of the Perpetual\r\nCurate. He had found out by practical experiments, almost for the first\r\ntime, that there were more things in earth and heaven than are dreamt of\r\nin the philosophy of youth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the next morning after this when Mrs Hadwin\'s strange lodger\r\nfirst appeared in the astonished house. He was the strangest lodger to\r\nbe taken into a house of such perfect respectability, a house in\r\nGrange Lane; and it came to be currently reported in Carlingford after\r\na time, when people knew more about it, that even the servants could\r\nnot tell when or how he arrived, but had woke up one morning to find a\r\npair of boots standing outside the closed door of the green room,\r\nwhich the good old lady kept for company, with sensations which it\r\nwould be impossible to describe. Such a pair of boots they were\r\ntoo--muddy beyond expression, with old mud which had not been brushed\r\noff for days--worn shapeless, and patched at the sides; the strangest\r\ncontrast to a handsome pair of Mr Wentworth\'s, which he, contrary to\r\nhis usual neat habits, had kicked off in his sitting-room, and which\r\nSarah, the housemaid, had brought and set down on the landing, close\r\nby these mysterious and unaccountable articles. When the bell of the\r\ngreen room rang an hour or two later, Sarah and the cook, who happened\r\nto be standing together, jumped three yards apart and stared at each\r\nother; the sound gave them both "a turn." But they soon got perfectly\r\nwell used to that bell from the green room. It rung very often in the\r\nday, for "the gentleman" chose to sit there more than half his time;\r\nand if other people were private about him, it was a great deal more\r\nthan he was about himself. He even sent the boots to be mended, to\r\nSarah\'s shame and confusion. For the credit of the house, the girl\r\ninvented a story about them to calm the cobbler\'s suspicions. "They\r\nwas the easiest boots the gentleman had, being troubled with tender\r\nfeet; and he wasn\'t a-going to give them up because they was shabby,"\r\nsaid Sarah. He sent down his shabby clothes to be brushed, and wore Mr\r\nWentworth\'s linen, to the indignation of the household. But he was not\r\na man to be concealed in a corner. From where he sat in the green\r\nroom, he whistled so beautifully that Mrs Hadwin\'s own pet canary\r\npaused astonished to listen, and the butcher\'s boy stole into the\r\nkitchen surreptitiously to try if he could learn the art; and while he\r\nwhistled, he filled the tidy room with parings and cuttings of wood,\r\nand carved out all kinds of pretty articles with his knife. But though\r\nhe rang his bell so often, and was so tiresome with his litter, and\r\ngave so much trouble, Sarah\'s heart, after a while, melted to "the\r\ngentleman." He made her a present of a needlecase, and was very\r\ncivil-spoken--more so a great deal than the Curate of St Roque\'s; and\r\nsuch a subject of talk and curiosity had certainly not been in\r\nCarlingford for a hundred years.\r\n\r\nAs for Mrs Hadwin, she never gave any explanation at all on the\r\nsubject, but accepted the fact of a new inmate cheerfully, as if she\r\nknew all about it. Of course she could not ask any of her nieces to\r\nvisit her while the green room was occupied; and as they were all\r\nrather large, interfering, managing women, perhaps the old lady was\r\nnot very sorry. Mr Wentworth himself was still less explanatory. When\r\nMr Wodehouse said to him, "What is this I hear about a brother of\r\nyours?--they tell me you\'ve got a brother staying with you. Well,\r\nthat\'s what I hear. Why don\'t you bring him up to dinner? Come\r\nto-morrow;" the Perpetual Curate calmly answered, "Thank you; but\r\nthere\'s no brother of mine in Carlingford," and took no further\r\nnotice. Naturally, however, this strange apparition was much discussed\r\nin Grange Lane; the servants first, and then the ladies, became\r\ncurious about him. Sometimes, in the evenings, he might be seen coming\r\nout of Mrs Hadwin\'s garden-door--a shabby figure, walking softly in\r\nhis patched boots. There never was light enough for any one to see\r\nhim; but he had a great beard, and smoked a short little pipe, and had\r\nevidently no regard for appearances. It was a kind of thing which few\r\npeople approved of. Mrs Hadwin ought not to permit it, some ladies\r\nsaid; and a still greater number were of the opinion that, rather than\r\nendure so strange a fellow-lodger, the Curate ought to withdraw, and\r\nfind fresh lodgings. This was before the time when the public began to\r\nassociate the stranger in a disagreeable way with Mr Wentworth. Before\r\nthey came to that, the people in Grange Lane bethought themselves of\r\nall Mrs Hadwin\'s connections, to find out if there might not be some\r\nof them under hiding; and, of course, that excellent woman had a\r\nnephew or two whose conduct was not perfect; and then it came to\r\nbe reported that it was Mr Wentworth\'s brother--that it was an\r\nunfortunate college chum of his--that it was somebody who had\r\nspeculated, and whom the Curate had gone shares with: but, in the mean\r\ntime, no real information could be obtained about this mysterious\r\nstranger. The butcher\'s boy, whose senses were quickened by mingled\r\nadmiration and envy, heard him whistling all day long, sometimes\r\nhidden among the trees in the garden, sometimes from the open window\r\nof the green room, where, indeed, Lady Western\'s page was ready to\r\ntake his oath he had once seen the audacious unknown leaning out in\r\nthe twilight, smoking a pipe. But no trap of conversation, however\r\ningenious--and many traps were laid for Mr Wentworth--ever elicited\r\nfrom the Perpetual Curate any acknowledgment of the other lodger\'s\r\nexistence. The young Anglican opened his fine eyes a little wider than\r\nusual when he was asked sympathetically whether so many people in the\r\nhouse did not interfere with his quiet. "Mrs Hadwin\'s talk is very\r\ngentle," said the Curate; "she never disturbs me." And the mistress of\r\nthe house was equally obtuse, and would not comprehend any allusion.\r\nThe little household came to be very much talked of in Carlingford in\r\nconsequence; and to meet that shabby figure in the evening, when one\r\nchanced to be out for a walk, made one\'s company sought after in the\r\nbest circles of society: though the fact is, that people began to be\r\nremiss in calling upon Mrs Hadwin, and a great many only left their\r\ncards as soon as it became evident that she did not mean to give any\r\nexplanation. To have the Curate to stay with her was possible, without\r\ninfringing upon her position; but matters became very different when\r\nshe showed herself willing to take "any one," even when in equivocal\r\napparel and patched boots.\r\n\r\nProbably the Curate had his own troubles during this period of his\r\nhistory. He was noticed to be a little quick and short in his temper for\r\nsome time after Easter. For one thing, his aunts did not go away; they\r\nstayed in the Blue Boar, and sent for him to dinner, till the Curate\'s\r\nimpatience grew almost beyond bearing. It was a discipline upon which he\r\nhad not calculated, and which exceeded the bounds of endurance,\r\nespecially as Miss Leonora questioned him incessantly about his "work,"\r\nand still dangled before him, like an unattainable sweet-meat before a\r\nchild, the comforts and advantages of Skelmersdale, where poor old Mr\r\nShirley had rallied for the fiftieth time. The situation altogether was\r\nvery tempting to Miss Leonora; she could not make up her mind to go away\r\nand leave such a very pretty quarrel in progress; and there can be no\r\ndoubt that it would have been highly gratifying to her vanity as an\r\nEvangelical woman to have had her nephew brought to task for missionary\r\nwork carried on in another man\'s parish, even though that work was not\r\nconducted entirely on her own principles. She lingered, accordingly,\r\nwith a great hankering after Wharfside, to which Mr Wentworth steadily\r\ndeclined to afford her any access. She went to the afternoon service\r\nsometimes, it is true, but only to be afflicted in her soul by the sight\r\nof Miss Wodehouse and Lucy in their grey cloaks, not to speak of the\r\nrubric to which the Curate was so faithful. It was a trying experience\r\nto his Evangelical aunt; but at the same time it was a "great work;" and\r\nshe could not give up the hope of being able one time or other to\r\nappropriate the credit of it, and win him over to her own "views." If\r\nthat consummation could but be attained, everything would become simple;\r\nand Miss Leonora was a true Wentworth, and wanted to see her nephew in\r\nSkelmersdale: so it may easily be understood that, under present\r\ncircumstances, there were great attractions for her in Carlingford.\r\n\r\nIt was, accordingly, with a beating heart that Miss Dora, feeling a\r\nlittle as she might have been supposed to feel thirty years before,\r\nhad she ever stolen forth from the well-protected enclosure of\r\nSkelmersdale Park to see a lover, put on her bonnet in the early\r\ntwilight, and, escaping with difficulty the lively observations of her\r\nmaid, went tremulously down Grange Lane to her nephew\'s house. She\r\nhad never yet visited Frank, and this visit was unquestionably\r\nclandestine. But then the news with which her heart was beating was\r\nimportant enough to justify the step she was taking--at least so she\r\nwhispered to herself; though whether dear Frank would be pleased, or\r\nwhether he would still think it "my fault," poor Miss Dora could not\r\nmake up her mind. Nothing happened in the quiet road, where there were\r\nscarcely any passengers, and the poor lady arrived with a trembling\r\nsense of escape from unknown perils at Mrs Hadwin\'s garden-door. For\r\nMiss Dora was of opinion, like some few other ladies, that to walk\r\nalone down the quietest of streets was to lay herself open to\r\nunheard-of dangers. She put out her trembling hand to ring the bell,\r\nthinking her perils over--for of course Frank would walk home with\r\nher--when the door suddenly opened, and a terrible apparition, quite\r\nunconscious of anybody standing there, marched straight out upon Miss\r\nDora, who gave a little scream, and staggered backwards, thinking the\r\nworst horrors she had dreamed of were about to be realised. They were\r\nso close together that the terrified lady took in every detail of his\r\nappearance. She saw the patched boots and that shabby coat which Sarah\r\nthe housemaid felt that she rather demeaned herself by brushing. It\r\nlooked too small for him, as coats will do when they get shabby; and,\r\nto complete the alarming appearance of the man, he had no hat, but\r\nonly a little travelling-cap surmounting the redundancy of hair,\r\nmustache, and beard, which were enough of themselves to strike any\r\nnervous woman with terror. "Oh, I beg your pardon," cried poor Miss\r\nDora, hysterically; "I wanted to see Mr Wentworth;" and she stood\r\ntrembling and panting for breath, holding by the wall, not quite sure\r\nthat this apparition could be appeased by any amount of apologies. It\r\nwas a great comfort to her when the monster took off its cap, and when\r\nshe perceived, by the undulations of the beard, something like a smile\r\nupon its hidden lips. "I believe Mr Wentworth is at church," said the\r\nnew lodger: "may I have the pleasure of seeing you safely across to St\r\nRoque\'s?" At which speech Miss Dora trembled more and more, and said,\r\nfaintly, "No, thank you,"--for who could tell what the man\'s\r\nintentions might be? The result was, however, that he only put on his\r\ncap again, and went off like any other human creature in the other\r\ndirection, and that slowly; with tremulous steps Miss Dora pursued her\r\nway to her nephew\'s pretty church. She could not have described, as\r\nshe herself said, what a relief it was after all this, to take Frank\'s\r\narm, as she met him at the door of St Roque\'s. He was coming out, and\r\nthe young lady with the grey cloak had been one of the congregation;\r\nand, to tell the truth, Miss Dora was an unwelcome addition just then\r\nto the party. Lucy\'s coming had been accidental, and it was very sweet\r\nto Mr Wentworth to be able to conclude that he was obliged to walk\r\nhome with her. They were both coming out from their evening devotions\r\ninto the tranquil spring twilight, very glad of the charmed quiet, and\r\nhappy somehow to find themselves alone together. That had happened but\r\nseldom of late; and a certain expectation of something that might\r\nhappen hovered over the heads of Lucy and the Curate. It did not\r\nmatter that he dared not say to her what was in his heart. Mr\r\nWentworth was only a young man after all, and the thrill of a possible\r\nrevelation was upon him in that half-hour upon which he was entering\r\nwith so profound a sense of happiness. And then it was an accidental\r\nmeeting, and if anything did happen, they could not blame themselves\r\nas if they had sought this opportunity of being together. The\r\ncircumstances were such that they might call it providential, if\r\nanything came of it. But just as the two had made their first step out\r\nof the church, where the organ was still murmuring low in the\r\ndarkness, and where the music of the last Amen, in which he had\r\nrecognised Lucy\'s voice, had not quite died from the Curate\'s ears, to\r\nmeet Miss Dora, pale and fluttered, full of news and distress, with no\r\nother thought in her mind but to appropriate her dear Frank, and take\r\nhis arm and gain his ear! It was very hard upon the Perpetual Curate.\r\nAs for Lucy, she, of course, did not say anything, but merely arranged\r\nher veil and greeted Miss Wentworth sweetly. Lucy walked on the other\r\nside of the Curate, saying little as Miss Dora\'s eager shower of\r\nquestions and remarks ran on. Perhaps she had a little insight into Mr\r\nWentworth\'s feelings, and no doubt it was rather tantalising. When\r\nthey came to Mrs Hadwin\'s door, the young Anglican made a spasmodic\r\neffort, which in his heart he felt to be unprincipled, and which, had\r\nit been successful, would have totally taken away the accidental and\r\nunpremeditated character of this walk with Lucy, which he could not\r\nfind it in his heart to relinquish. He proposed that his aunt should\r\ngo in and rest while he saw Miss Wodehouse safely home--he was sure\r\nshe was tired, he said, eagerly. "No, my dear, not at all," said Miss\r\nDora; "it is such a pleasant evening, and I know Miss Wodehouse\'s is\r\nnot very far off. I should like the walk, and, besides, it is too\r\nlate, you know, to see Mrs Hadwin, and I should not like to go in\r\nwithout calling on her; and besides--"\r\n\r\nMr Wentworth in his aggravation gave a momentary sudden glance at Lucy\r\nwhen she had no expectation of it. That glance of disappointment--of\r\ndisgust--of love and longing, was no more intentional than their\r\nmeeting; could he help it, if it revealed that heart which was in such\r\na state of commotion and impatience? Anyhow, the look gave Lucy\r\nsufficient occupation to keep her very quiet on the other side while\r\nMiss Dora maundered on.\r\n\r\n"I met the strangest man coming out when I was going to ring your\r\nbell. You will think it very foolish, Frank, but he frightened me,"\r\nshe said. "A man with a terrible beard, and a--a shabby man, my dear.\r\nWho could it be? Not a person to be seen coming out of a house where a\r\nclergyman lives. He could not be any friend of yours?"\r\n\r\n"The other lodger, I suppose," said the Curate, briefly. "When are you\r\ngoing away?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, my dear boy, we are not going away; I came to tell you. But,\r\nFrank, you don\'t mean to say that such a man as that lodges in Mrs\r\nHadwin\'s house? I don\'t think it is safe for you--I don\'t think it is\r\nrespectable. People might think he was a friend of yours. I wonder if\r\nMiss Wodehouse has ever seen him--a great man with a beard? To be\r\nsure, a man might have a beard and yet be respectable; but I am sure,\r\nif Miss Wodehouse saw him, she would agree with me in thinking--\r\nFrank, my dear boy, what is the matter? Have I said anything wrong?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing that I know of," said the Curate, who had given her arm a\r\nlittle angry pressure to stop the stream of utterance--"only that I am\r\nnot interested in the other lodger. Tell me about your going away."\r\n\r\n"But I must appeal to Miss Wodehouse: it is for your own sake, my dear\r\nFrank," said aunt Dora--"a clergyman should be so careful. I don\'t\r\nknow what your aunt Leonora would say. Don\'t you think to see a man\r\nlike that coming out of Mr Wentworth\'s house is not as it should be? I\r\nassure you he frightened me."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think I have seen him," said Lucy. "But shouldn\'t a clergyman\'s\r\nhouse be like the church, open to good and bad?--for it is to the wicked\r\nand the miserable you are sent," said the Sister of Mercy, lowering her\r\nvoice and glancing up at the Perpetual Curate. They could have clasped\r\neach other\'s hands at that moment, almost without being aware that it\r\nwas any personal feeling which made their agreement so sweet. As for\r\nMiss Dora, she went on leaning on her nephew\'s arm, totally unconscious\r\nof the suppressed rapture and elevation in which the two were moving at\r\nthe other side.\r\n\r\n"That is very true. I am sure your aunt Leonora would approve of that,\r\ndear," said Miss Dora, with a little answering pressure on her\r\nnephew\'s arm--"but still I have a feeling that a clergyman should\r\nalways take care to be respectable. Not that he should neglect the\r\nwicked," continued the poor aunt, apologetically, "for a poor sinner\r\nturning from the evil of his ways is the--the most interesting--sight\r\nin the world, even to the angels, you know; but to _live_ with them in\r\nthe same house, my dear--I am sure that is what I never could advise,\r\nnor Leonora either; and Mrs Hadwin ought to know better, and have him\r\naway. Don\'t you know who he is, Frank? I could not be content without\r\nfinding out, if it was me."\r\n\r\n"I have nothing to do with him," said the Curate, hurriedly: "it is a\r\nsubject I don\'t want to discuss. Never mind him. What do you mean by\r\nsaying you are not going away?"\r\n\r\n"My dear, Leonora has been thinking it all over," said Miss Dora, "and\r\nwe are so anxious about you. Leonora is very fond of you, though she\r\ndoes not show it; and you know the Meritons have just come home from\r\nIndia, and have not a house to go to. So you see we thought, as you\r\nare not quite so comfortable as we could wish to see you, Frank--and\r\nperhaps we might be of some use--and Mr Shirley is better again, and\r\nno immediate settlement has to be made about Skelmersdale;--that on\r\nthe whole, if Leonora and you were to see more of each other--oh, my\r\ndear boy, don\'t be so hasty; it was all her own doing--it was not my\r\nfault."\r\n\r\n"Fault! I am sorry to be the occasion of so many arrangements," said Mr\r\nWentworth, with his stiff manner; "but, of course, if you like to stay\r\nin Carlingford I shall be very happy--though there is not much preaching\r\nhere that will suit my aunt Leonora: as for Mr Shirley, I hope he\'ll\r\nlive for ever. I was at No. 10 today," continued the Curate, turning his\r\nhead to the other side, and changing his tone in a manner marvellous to\r\nMiss Dora. "I don\'t think she can live much longer. You have done a\r\ngreat deal to smooth her way in this last stage. Poor soul! she thinks\r\nshe has been a great sinner," said the young man, with a kind of\r\nwondering pity. He had a great deal to vex him in his own person, and\r\nhe knew of some skeletons very near at hand, but somehow at that moment\r\nit was hard to think of the extremities of mortal trouble, of death and\r\nanguish--those dark deeps of life by which Lucy and he sometimes stood\r\ntogether in their youth and happiness. A marvelling remorseful pity came\r\nto his heart. He could not believe in misery, with Lucy walking softly\r\nin the spring twilight by his side.\r\n\r\n"But, Frank, you are not taking any notice of what I say," said Miss\r\nDora, with something like a suppressed sob. "I don\'t doubt your sick\r\npeople are very important, but I thought you would take _some_\r\ninterest. I came down to tell you, all the way by myself."\r\n\r\n"My sister would like to call on you, Miss Wentworth," said Lucy,\r\ninterposing. "Gentlemen never understand what one says. Perhaps we\r\ncould be of some use to you if you are going to settle in Carlingford.\r\nI think she has been a great deal better since she confessed,"\r\ncontinued the charitable Sister, looking up to the Curate, and, like\r\nhim, dropping her voice. "The absolution was such a comfort. Now she\r\nseems to feel as if she could die. And she has so little to live for!"\r\nsaid Lucy, with a sigh of sympathetic feeling, remorseful too. Somehow\r\nit seemed cruel to feel so young, so hopeful, so capable of happiness,\r\nwith such desolation close at hand.\r\n\r\n"Not even duty," said the Curate; "and to think that the Church should\r\nhesitate to remove the last barriers out of the way! I would not be a\r\npriest if I were debarred from the power of delivering such a poor\r\nsoul."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Frank," said Miss Dora, with a long breath of fright and horror,\r\n"_what_ are you saying? Oh, my dear, don\'t say it over again, I don\'t\r\nwant to hear it! I hope when we are dying we shall all feel what great\r\ngreat sinners we are," said the poor lady, who, between vexation and\r\nmortification, was ready to cry, "and not think that one is better\r\nthan another. Oh, my dear, there is that man again! Do you think it is\r\nsafe to meet him in such a lonely road? If he comes across and speaks\r\nto me any more I shall faint," cried poor Miss Dora, whose opinions\r\nwere not quite in accordance with her feelings. Mr Wentworth did not\r\nsay anything to soothe her, but with his unoccupied hand he made an\r\ninvoluntary movement towards Lucy\'s cloak, and plucked at it to bring\r\nher nearer, as the bearded stranger loomed dimly past, looking at the\r\ngroup. Lucy felt the touch, and wondered and looked up at him in the\r\ndarkness. She could not comprehend the Curate\'s face.\r\n\r\n"Are _you_ afraid of him?" she said, with a slight smile; "if it is\r\nonly his beard I am not alarmed; and here is papa coming to meet me. I\r\nthought you would have come for me sooner, papa. Has anything\r\nhappened?" said Lucy, taking Mr Wodehouse\'s arm, who had suddenly\r\nappeared from underneath the lamp, still unlighted, at Dr\r\nMarjoribanks\'s door. She clung to her father with unusual eagerness,\r\nwilling enough to escape from the darkness and the Curate\'s side, and\r\nall the tremulous sensations of the hour.\r\n\r\n"What could happen?" said Mr Wodehouse, who still looked "limp" from\r\nhis recent illness, "though I hear there are doubtful people about; so\r\nthey tell me--but you ought to know best, Wentworth. Who is that\r\nfellow in the beard that went by on the other side? Not little Lake\r\nthe drawing-master? Fancied I had seen the build of the man\r\nbefore--eh?--a stranger? Well, it\'s a mistake, perhaps. Can\'t be sure\r\nof anything nowadays;--memory failing. Well, that\'s what the doctor\r\nsays. Come in and rest and see Molly; as for me, I\'m not good for\r\nmuch, but you won\'t get better company than the girls, or else that\'s\r\nwhat folks tell me. Who did you say that fellow was?" said the\r\nchurchwarden, leaning across his daughter to see Mr Wentworth\'s face.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know anything about him," said the Curate of St Roque\'s.\r\n\r\nAnd curiously enough silence fell upon the little party, nobody could\r\ntell how;--for two minutes, which looked like twenty, no one spoke.\r\nThen Lucy roused herself, apparently with a little effort. "We seem to\r\ntalk of nothing but the man with the beard to-night," she said. "Mary\r\nknows everything that goes on in Carlingford--she will tell us about\r\nhim; and if Miss Wentworth thinks it too late to come in, we will say\r\ngood-night," she continued, with a little decision of tone, which was\r\nnot incomprehensible to the Perpetual Curate. Perhaps she was a little\r\nprovoked and troubled in her own person. To say so much in looks and\r\nso little in words, was a mode of procedure which puzzled Lucy. It\r\nfretted her, because it looked unworthy of her hero. She withdrew\r\nwithin the green door, holding her father\'s arm fast, and talking to\r\nhim, while Mr Wentworth strained his ears after the voice, which he\r\nthought he could have singled out from a thousand voices. Perhaps Lucy\r\ntalked to drown her thoughts; and the Curate went away dumb and\r\nabstracted, with his aunt leaning on his arm on the other side of the\r\nwall. He could not be interested, as Miss Dora expected him to be, in\r\nthe Miss Wentworths\' plans. He conducted her to the Blue Boar\r\nlanguidly, with an evident indifference to the fact that his aunt\r\nLeonora was about to become a permanent resident in Carlingford. He\r\nsaid "Good-night" kindly to little Rosa Elsworthy, looking out with\r\nbright eyes into the darkness at the door of her uncle\'s shop; but he\r\nsaid little to Miss Dora, who could not tell what to make of him, and\r\nswallowed her tears as quietly as possible under her veil. When he had\r\ndeposited his aunt safely at the inn, the Perpetual Curate hastened\r\ndown Grange Lane at a great pace. The first sound he heard on entering\r\nMrs Hadwin\'s garden was the clear notes of the stranger\'s whistle\r\namong the trees; and with an impatient exclamation Mr Wentworth sought\r\nhis fellow-lodger, who was smoking as usual, pacing up and down a\r\nshaded walk, where, even in daylight, he was pretty well concealed\r\nfrom observation. The Curate looked as if he had a little discontent\r\nand repugnance to get over before he could address the anonymous\r\nindividual who whistled so cheerily under the trees. When he did speak\r\nit was an embarrassed and not very intelligible call.\r\n\r\n"I say--are you there? I want to speak to you," said Mr Wentworth.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said the stranger, turning sharply round. "I am here, a dog\r\nwithout a name. What have you got to say?"\r\n\r\n"Only that you must be more careful," said Mr Wentworth again, with a\r\nlittle stiffness. "You will be recognised if you don\'t mind. I have\r\njust been asked who you were by--somebody who thought he had seen you\r\nbefore."\r\n\r\n"By whom?"\r\n\r\n"Well, by Mr Wodehouse," said the Curate. "I may as well tell you; if\r\nyou mean to keep up this concealment you must take care."\r\n\r\n"By Jove!" said the stranger, and then he whistled a few bars of the\r\nair which Mr Wentworth\'s arrival had interrupted. "What is a fellow to\r\ndo?" he said, after an interjection. "I sometimes think I had better\r\nrisk it all--eh! don\'t you think so? I can\'t shut myself up for ever\r\nhere."\r\n\r\n"That must be as you think best," said the Perpetual Curate, in whom\r\nthere appeared no movement of sympathy; and he said no more, though the\r\ndoubtful individual by his side lifted an undecided look to his face,\r\nand once more murmured in perplexed tones a troubled exclamation: "A man\r\nmust have a little amusement somehow," the stranger said, with an\r\naggrieved voice; and then abruptly left his unsociable companion, and\r\nwent off to his room, where he summoned Sarah to bring lights, and tried\r\nto talk to her a little in utter dearth of society. Mr Wentworth stayed\r\nbehind, pacing up and down the darkening walk. The Curate\'s thoughts\r\nwere far from satisfactory. There was not much comfort anywhere, let him\r\nlook where he pleased. When a man has no spot in all his horizon on\r\nwhich his eye can rest with comfort, there is something more discouraging\r\nin the prospect than a positive calamity. He could not take refuge even\r\nin the imaginations of his love, for it was clear enough that already a\r\nsentiment of surprise had risen in Lucy\'s mind, and her tranquillity was\r\nshaken. And perhaps he had done rashly to plunge into other people\'s\r\ntroubles--he upon whom a curious committee of aunts were now to sit _en\r\npermanence_. He went in to write his sermon, far from being so assured\r\nof things in general as that discourse was when it was written, though\r\nit was a little relief to his mind to fall back upon an authority\r\nsomewhere, and to refer, in terms which were perhaps too absolute to be\r\naltogether free of doubt, to the Church, which had arranged everything\r\nfor her children in one department of their concerns at least. If it\r\nwere only as easy to know what ought to be done in one\'s personal\r\naffairs as to decide what was the due state of mind expected by the\r\nChurch on the second Sunday after Easter! But being under that guidance,\r\nat least he could not go wrong in his sermon, which was one point of\r\nease amid the many tribulations of the Curate of St Roque\'s.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n\r\n"If they are going to stay in Carlingford, perhaps we could be of use\r\nto them? Yes, Lucy; and I am sure anything we could do for Mr\r\nWentworth--" said Miss Wodehouse. "I wonder what house they will get.\r\nI am going to Elsworthy\'s about some paper, and we can ask him if he\r\nknows where they are going. That poor little Rosa should have some one\r\nto take care of her. I often wonder whether it would be kind to speak\r\nto Mrs Elsworthy about it, Lucy; she is a sensible woman. The little\r\nthing stands at the door in the evening, and talks to people who are\r\npassing, and I am afraid there are some people who are unprincipled,\r\nand tell her she is pretty, and say things to her," said Miss\r\nWodehouse, shaking her head; "it is a great pity. Even Mr Wentworth is\r\na great deal more civil to that little thing than he would be if she\r\nhad not such a pretty face."\r\n\r\n"I said you knew everything that went on in Carlingford," said Lucy,\r\nas they went out together from the green door, not in their grey\r\ncloaks this time; "but I forgot to ask you about one thing that\r\npuzzled us last night--who is the man in the beard who lives at Mrs\r\nHadwin\'s? Mr Wentworth will not tell anybody about him, and I think he\r\nknows."\r\n\r\n"Who is the man in the beard?" said Miss Wodehouse, with a gasp. She\r\ngrew very pale, and turned away her head and shivered visibly. "How\r\nvery cold it is!" she said, with her teeth chattering; "did you think\r\nit was so cold? I--I don\'t know any men with beards; and it is so\r\nstrange of you to say I know everything that goes on in Carlingford.\r\nDon\'t stop to speak to that little girl just now. Did you say she came\r\nfrom Prickett\'s Lane? No. 10? It is very right to go to see the sick,\r\nbut, indeed, I don\'t approve of your attendance upon that poor woman,\r\nLucy. When I was a girl I dared not have gone away by myself as you\r\ndo, and she might not be a proper person. There is a carriage that I\r\ndon\'t know standing before Elsworthy\'s shop."\r\n\r\n"But you have not told me yet about the man with the beard," said\r\nLucy, whose curiosity was excited. She looked at her sister keenly\r\nwith an investigating look, and poor Miss Wodehouse was fain to draw\r\nher shawl close round her, and complain again of the cold.\r\n\r\n"I told you I did not know," she said, with a complaining tone in her\r\nvoice. "It is strange you should think I knew; it looks as if you\r\nthought me a gossip, Lucy. I wonder who those people can be coming out\r\nof the carriage? My dear," said the elder sister, feeling within\r\nherself that an attack upon the enemy\'s country was the best means of\r\nmeeting any sally--"I don\'t think you should go down to Prickett\'s\r\nLane just now. I saw Mr Wentworth pass a little while ago, and people\r\nmight say you went to meet each other. I can\'t keep people from\r\ntalking, Lucy, and you are both so young; and you know I spoke to you\r\nbefore about your meeting so often. It will be a great deal better for\r\nyou to come with me to call on his aunts."\r\n\r\n"Only that my poor patient wants me," said Lucy. "Must I not do my\r\nduty to a poor woman who is dying, because Mr Wentworth is in\r\nPrickett\'s Lane? There is no reason why I should be afraid of meeting\r\nMr Wentworth," said the young district-visitor, severely; and the\r\nelder sister saw that Lucy spoke in a different tone from that in\r\nwhich she had answered her before. She did not extinguish Miss\r\nWodehouse by a reference to the great work. She treated the matter\r\nmore as a personal one to-day; and a shadow--a very ghost of\r\nirritation--was in Lucy\'s voice. The two crossed the street silently\r\nafter that to Elsworthy\'s, where a group of ladies were visible, who\r\nhad come out of the strange carriage. One of them was seated in a\r\nchair by the counter, another was reading a list which Mr Elsworthy\r\nhad just presented to her, and the third, who was not so tall as her\r\nsister, was pressing up to it on tiptoe, trying to read it too. "That\r\nis Miss Dora Wentworth," said Lucy, "and the other, I suppose, is Miss\r\nLeonora, who is so very Low-Church. I think I can see the Miss\r\nHemmings coming down George Street. If I were to go in I should be in\r\na dreadful minority; but you are Low-Church in your heart too."\r\n\r\n"No, dear; only reasonable," said Miss Wodehouse, apologetically. "I\r\ndon\'t go as far as you and Mr Wentworth do, but I like the service to\r\nbe nicely done, and the--the authority of the Church respected too. As\r\nI have never met Miss Wentworth, you had better come in and introduce\r\nme. There is Rosa looking out of the front window, Lucy. I really must\r\nspeak to Mrs Elsworthy about that child. What a lovely old lady that\r\nis sitting by the counter! Say I am your sister, and then if you are\r\nresolved upon Prickett\'s Lane, you can go away."\r\n\r\n"They are the two who wear the grey cloaks," said Miss Leonora\r\nWentworth to herself, as the introduction was effected. "I am glad to\r\nmake your acquaintance, Miss Wodehouse. We are going to stay in\r\nCarlingford for a time, and to know a few pious families will be a\r\ngreat advantage. We don\'t go much into society, in the usual sense of\r\nthe word--but, I am sure, to make the acquaintance of ladies who help\r\nmy nephew so much in his work, is sure to be an advantage. I should\r\nlike so much to hear from you how he gets on, for he does not say a\r\ngreat deal about it himself."\r\n\r\n"He is so good and so nice," said kind Miss Wodehouse, "he never makes\r\na fuss about anything he does. I am sure, to see such young creatures\r\nso pious and so devoted, always goes to my heart. When we were young\r\nit used to be so different--we took our own pleasure, and never\r\nthought of our fellow-creatures. And the young people are so good\r\nnowadays," said the gentle woman, falling instinctively into her\r\nfavourite sentiment. Miss Leonora looked at her with critical eyes.\r\n\r\n"We are none of us good," said that iron-grey woman, whose neutral\r\ntints were so different from the soft dove-colour of her new\r\nacquaintance; "it does not become such sinful creatures to talk of\r\nanybody being good. Good works may only be beautiful sins, if they are\r\nnot done in a true spirit," said Miss Leonora, turning to her list of\r\nfurnished houses with a little contempt. But the Miss Hemmings had\r\ncome in while she was speaking, and it was seldom that such edifying\r\ntalk was heard in Carlingford.\r\n\r\n"That is such a beautiful sentiment--oh, if we only bore it always in\r\nmind!" murmured the eldest Miss Hemmings. "Mr Elsworthy, I hope you\r\nhave got the tracts I ordered. They are so much wanted here. Poor dear\r\nMr Bury would not believe his eyes if he could see Carlingford now,\r\ngiven up to Puseyism and Ritualism--but good men are taken away from\r\nthe evil to come. I will pay for them now, please."\r\n\r\n"If you wish it, ma\'am," said Mr Elsworthy. "The town _is_ changed; I\r\ndon\'t say nothing different; but being in the ritual line as you say,\r\nyou won\'t find no church as it\'s better done than in St Roque\'s. Mr\r\nWentworth never spares no pains, ma\'am, on anything as he takes up.\r\nI\'ve heard a deal of clergymen in my day, but _his_ reading is\r\nbeautiful; I can\'t say as I ever heard reading as could equal it;--and\r\nthem choristers, though they\'re hawful to manage, is trained as I\r\nnever see boys trained in _my_ life afore. There\'s one of them houses,\r\nma\'am," continued the optimist, turning to Miss Wentworth, "as is a\r\nbeauty. Miss Wodehouse can tell you what it is; no lady in the land\r\ncould desire a handsomer drawing-room; and as for the kitchings,--I\r\ndon\'t pretend to be a judge up-stairs, but being brought up a\r\nblacksmith, I know what\'s what in a kitching-range. If you had all\r\nGrange Lane to dinner, there\'s a range as is equal to it," said Mr\r\nElsworthy with enthusiasm--"and my wife will show you the \'ouse."\r\n\r\n"I knew Mr Bury," said Miss Leonora; "he was a precious man. Perhaps\r\nyou have heard him mention the Miss Wentworths? I am very sorry to\r\nhear that there is no real work going on in the town. It is very sad\r\nthat there should be nobody able to enter into the labours of such a\r\nsaint."\r\n\r\n"Indeed," said Miss Wodehouse, who was excited, in spite of herself,\r\nby this conversation, "I think the Carlingford people go quite as much\r\nto church as in Mr Bury\'s days. I don\'t think there is less religion\r\nthan there used to be: there are not so many prayer meetings, perhaps;\r\nbut--"\r\n\r\n"There is nothing the carnal mind dislikes so much as prayer meetings,"\r\nsaid Miss Hemmings. "There is a house in Grove Street, if Miss Wentworth\r\nis looking for a house. I don\'t know much about the kitchen-range, but I\r\nknow it belongs to a very pious family, and they wish so much to let\r\nit. My sister and I would be so glad to take you there. It is not in the\r\ngay world, like Grange Lane."\r\n\r\n"But you might want to ask people to dinner; and then we should be so\r\nnear Frank," said Miss Dora, whispering at her sister\'s elbow. As for\r\nthe second Miss Hemmings, she was dull of comprehension, and did not\r\nquite make out who the strangers were.\r\n\r\n"It is so sad to a feeling mind to see the mummeries that go on at St\r\nRoque\'s," said this obtuse sister; "and I am afraid poor Mr Wentworth\r\nmust be in a bad way. They say there is the strangest man in his\r\nhouse--some relation of his--and he daren\'t be seen in the daylight;\r\nand people begin to think there must be something wrong, and that Mr\r\nWentworth himself is involved; but what can you expect when there is\r\nno true Christian principle?" asked Miss Hemmings, triumphantly. It\r\nwas a dreadful moment for the bystanders; for Miss Leonora turned\r\nround upon this new intelligence with keen eyes and attention; and\r\nMiss Dora interposed, weeping; and Miss Wodehouse grew so pale, that\r\nMr Elsworthy rushed for cold water, and thought she was going to\r\nfaint. "Tell me all about this," said Miss Leonora, with peremptory\r\nand commanding tones. "Oh, Leonora, I am sure my dear Frank has\r\nnothing to do with it, if there is anything wrong," cried Miss Dora.\r\nEven Miss Wentworth herself was moved out of her habitual smile. She\r\nsaid, "He is my nephew"--an observation which she had never been heard\r\nto make before, and which covered the second Miss Hemmings with\r\nconfusion. As for Miss Wodehouse, she retreated very fast to a seat\r\nbehind Miss Cecilia, and said nothing. The two who had arrived last\r\nslunk back upon each other with fiery glances of mutual reproach. The\r\nformer three stood together in this emergency, full of curiosity, and\r\nperhaps a little anxiety. In this position of affairs, Mr Elsworthy,\r\nbeing the only impartial person present, took the management of\r\nmatters into his own hands.\r\n\r\n"Miss Hemmings and ladies, if you\'ll allow _me_," said Mr Elsworthy,\r\n"it aint no more than a mistake. The new gentleman as is staying at\r\nMrs Hadwin\'s may be an unfortunate gentleman for anything I can tell;\r\nbut he aint no relation of our clergyman. There aint nobody belonging\r\nto Mr Wentworth," said the clerk of St Roque\'s, "but is a credit both\r\nto him and to Carlingford. There\'s his brother, the Rev. Mr Wentworth,\r\nas is the finest-spoken man, to be a clergyman, as I ever set eyes on;\r\nand there\'s respected ladies as needn\'t be named more particular. But\r\nthe gentleman as is the subject of conversation is no more like Mr\r\nWentworth than--asking pardon for the liberty--I am. I may say as I\r\nhave opportunities for knowing more than most," said Mr Elsworthy,\r\nmodestly, "me and Rosa; for if there\'s a thing Mr Wentworth is\r\nparticular about, it\'s having his papers the first moment; and ladies\r\nas knows me knows I am one that never says more nor the truth. Not\r\nsaying a word against the gentleman--as is a most respectable\r\ngentleman, for anything I know against him--he aint no connection of\r\nMr Wentworth. He\'s Mrs Hadwin\'s lodger; and I wouldn\'t say as he isn\'t\r\na relation there; but our clergyman has got no more to do with him\r\nthan the babe unborn."\r\n\r\nMr Elsworthy wiped his forehead after he had made this speech, and\r\nlooked round for the approbation which he was aware he had deserved;\r\nand Miss Leonora Wentworth threw a glance of disdainful observation\r\nupon the unhappy lady who had caused this disturbance. "If your wife\r\nwill come with us, we will go and look at the house," she said,\r\ngraciously. "I daresay if it is in Grange Lane it will suit us very\r\nwell. My nephew is a very young man, Miss Wodehouse," said Miss\r\nLeonora, who had not passed over the agitation of that gentle woman\r\nwithout some secret comments; "he does not take advice in his work,\r\nthough it might be of great assistance to him; but I hope he\'ll grow\r\nolder and wiser, as indeed he cannot help doing if he lives. I hope\r\nyou and your pretty sister will come to see us when we\'re settled;--I\r\ndon\'t see any sense, you know, in your grey cloaks--I\'m old, and you\r\nwon\'t mind me saying so; but I know what Frank Wentworth is," said the\r\nindignant aunt, making a severe curtsy, accompanied by lightning\r\nglances at the shrinking background of female figures, as she went out\r\nof the shop.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Leonora! I always said you were fond of him, though you never\r\nwould show it," cried poor Miss Dora. "She is a great deal more\r\naffectionate than she will let anybody believe; and my dear Frank\r\nmeans nothing but good," cried the too zealous champion. Miss Leonora\r\nturned back upon the threshold of the shop.\r\n\r\n"You will please to let me know what Dissenting chapels there are in\r\nthe town, and what are the hours of the services," she said. "There\r\nmust surely be a Bethesda, or Zion, or something--Salem? yes, to be\r\nsure;--perhaps there\'s somebody there that preaches the gospel. Send\r\nme word," said the peremptory woman; and poor Miss Dora relapsed into\r\nher usual melancholy condition, and stole into the carriage in a\r\nbroken-hearted manner, weeping under her veil.\r\n\r\nAfter which Miss Wodehouse went home, not having much heart for\r\nfurther visits. That is to say, she went all the way down Grange Lane,\r\nsomewhat tremulous and uncertain in her steps, and went as far as Mrs\r\nHadwin\'s, and hesitated at the door as if she meant to call there;\r\nbut, thinking better of it, went on a little farther with very\r\nlingering steps, as if she did not know what she wanted. When she came\r\nback again, the door of Mrs Hadwin\'s garden was open, and the\r\nbutcher\'s boy stood blocking up the way, listening with all his ears\r\nto the notes of the whistle, soft and high and clear like the notes of\r\na bird which come audibly from among the trees. Miss Wodehouse gave a\r\nlittle start when she heard it: again she hesitated, and looked in\r\nwith such a wistful face that Sarah, the housemaid, who had been about\r\nto slam the door hastily upon the too tender butcher, involuntarily\r\nheld it wide open for the expected visitor. "No, not to-day thank\r\nyou," said Miss Wodehouse. "I hope your mistress is quite well; give\r\nher my love, and say I meant to come in, but I have a bad headache.\r\nNo, thank you; not to-day." She went away after that with a wonderful\r\nexpression of face, and reached home long before Lucy had come back\r\nfrom Prickett\'s Lane. Miss Wodehouse was not good for much in the\r\nhouse. She went to the little boudoir up-stairs, and lay down on the\r\nsofa, and had some tea brought her by an anxious maid. She was very\r\nnervous, trembling she could not say why, and took up a novel which\r\nwas lying on the sofa, and read the most affecting scene, and cried\r\nover it; and then her sweet old face cleared, and she felt better.\r\nWhen Lucy came in she kissed her sister, and drew down the blinds, and\r\nbrought her the third volume, and then went away herself to arrange\r\nthe dessert, and see that everything was in order for one of Mr\r\nWodehouse\'s little parties. These were their respective parts in the\r\nhouse; and surely a more peaceful, and orderly, and affectionate\r\nhouse, was not to be found that spring evening, either in England or\r\nGrange Lane.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may be easily supposed after this that Mr Wentworth and his\r\nproceedings were sufficiently overlooked and commented upon in\r\nCarlingford. The Miss Wentworths took old Major Brown\'s house for six\r\nmonths, which, as everybody knows, is next door to Dr Marjoribanks. It\r\nwas just after Letty Brown\'s marriage, and the poor old Major was very\r\nglad to go away and pay a round of visits, and try to forget that his\r\nlast daughter had gone the way of all the rest. There was a\r\nsummer-house built in the corner of the garden, with a window in the\r\nouter wall looking on to Grange Lane, from which everything that\r\nhappened could be inspected; and there was always somebody at that\r\nwindow when the Perpetual Curate passed by. Then he began to have a\r\nstrange painful feeling that Lucy watched too, and was observing all\r\nhis looks and ways, and what he did and said in these changed times.\r\nIt was a strange difference from the sweet half-conscious bond between\r\nthem which existed of old, when they walked home together from\r\nWharfside, talking of the district and the people, in the tender union\r\nof unspoken love and fellowship. Not that they were altogether parted\r\nnow; but Lucy contrived to leave the schoolroom most days before the\r\nyoung priest could manage to disrobe himself, and was seldom to be\r\nseen on the road lingering on her errands of kindness as she used to\r\ndo. But still she knew all he was about, and watched, standing in\r\ndoubt and wonder of him, which was at least a great deal better than\r\nindifference. On the whole, however, it was a cloudy world through\r\nwhich the Perpetual Curate passed as he went from his lodgings, where\r\nthe whistle of the new lodger had become a great nuisance to him, past\r\nthe long range of garden-walls, the sentinel window where Miss Dora\r\nlooked out watching for him, and Mr Wodehouse\'s green door which he no\r\nlonger entered every day. Over the young man\'s mind, as he went out to\r\nhis labours, there used to come that sensation of having nobody to\r\nfall back upon, which is of all feelings the most desolate. Amid all\r\nthose people who were watching him, there was no one upon whom he\r\ncould rest, secure of understanding and sympathy. They were all\r\ncritical--examining, with more or less comprehension, what he did; and\r\nhe could not think of anybody in the world just then who would be\r\ncontent with knowing that _he_ did it, and take that as warranty for\r\nthe act, unless, perhaps, his poor aunt Dora, whose opinion was not\r\nimportant to the young man. It was not a pleasant state of mind into\r\nwhich these feelings threw him; and the natural result was, that he\r\ngrew more and more careful about the rubric, and confined his sermons,\r\nwith increasing precision, to the beautiful arrangements of the\r\nChurch. They were very clever little sermons, even within these\r\nlimitations, and an indifferent spectator would probably have been\r\nsurprised to find how much he could make out of them; but still it is\r\nundeniable that a man has less scope, not only for oratory, but for\r\nall that is worthy of regard in human speech, when, instead of the\r\never-lasting reciprocations between heaven and earth, he occupies\r\nhimself only with a set of ecclesiastical arrangements, however\r\nperfect. The people who went to St Roque\'s found this out, and so did\r\nMr Wentworth; but it did not alter the system pursued by the troubled\r\nCurate. Perhaps he gave himself some half-conscious credit for it, as\r\nbeing against his own interests; for there was no mistaking the\r\ncountenance of Miss Leonora, when now and then, on rare occasions, she\r\ncame to hear her nephew preach.\r\n\r\nAll this, however, was confined to St Roque\'s, where there was a\r\nsomewhat select audience, people who agreed in Mr Wentworth\'s views;\r\nbut things were entirely different at Wharfside, where the Perpetual\r\nCurate was not thinking about himself, but simply about his work, and\r\nhow to do it best. The bargemen and their wives did not know much\r\nabout the Christian year; but they understood the greater matters\r\nwhich lay beneath: and the women said to each other, sometimes with\r\ntears in their eyes, that there was nothing that the clergyman didn\'t\r\nmake plain; and that if the men didn\'t do what was right, it was none\r\no\' Mr Wentworth\'s fault. The young priest indemnified himself in "the\r\ndistrict" for much that vexed him elsewhere. There was no question of\r\nSkelmersdale, or of any moot point there, but only a quantity of\r\nprimitive people under the original conditions of humanity, whose\r\nlives might be amended, and consoled, and elevated. That was a matter\r\nabout which Mr Wentworth had no doubt. He put on his surplice with\r\nthe conviction that in that white ephod the truest embodiment of\r\nChristian purity was brought within sight of the darkened world. He\r\nwas not himself, but a Christian priest, with power to deliver and to\r\nbless, when he went to Wharfside.\r\n\r\nEaster had been early that year, and Ascension Day was in the\r\nbeginning of May, one of those sweet days of early summer which still\r\noccur now and then to prove that the poets were right in all they say\r\nof the tenderest month of the year. Mr Wentworth had done duty at St\r\nRoque\'s, and afterwards at Wharfside. The sweet day and the sweet\r\nseason had moved his heart. He was young, and it was hard to live shut\r\nup within himself without any sympathy either from man or woman. He\r\nhad watched the grey cloak gliding out as his rude congregation\r\ndispersed, and went away quicker than was his wont, with a stronger\r\nlonging than usual to overtake Lucy, and recover his place beside her.\r\nBut she was not to be seen when he got into Prickett\'s Lane. He looked\r\nup the weary length of the street, and saw nothing but the children\r\nplaying on the pavement, and some slovenly mothers at the doors. It\r\nwas a very disenchanting prospect. He went on again in a kind of\r\ngloomy discontent, displeased with everything. What was the good of it\r\nall? he said to himself--weariness, and toil, and trouble, and nothing\r\never to come of it. As for the little good he was doing in Wharfside,\r\nGod did not need his poor exertions; and, to tell the truth, going on\r\nat St Roque\'s, however perfect the rubric and pretty the church, was,\r\nwithout any personal stimulant of happiness, no great prospect for the\r\nPerpetual Curate. Such was the tenor of his thoughts, when he saw a\r\nblack figure suddenly emerge out of one of the houses, and stand at\r\nthe door, throwing a long shadow over the pavement. It was the Rector\r\nwho was standing there in Mr Wentworth\'s favourite district, talking\r\nto a shopkeeper who had always been on the opposition side. The young\r\nAnglican raised his drooping head instantly, and recovered his\r\ninterest in the general world.\r\n\r\n"Glad to see you, Mr Wentworth," said the Rector. "I have been\r\nspeaking to this worthy man about the necessities of the district. The\r\nstatistics are far from being satisfactory. Five thousand souls, and\r\nno provision for their spiritual wants; it is a very sad state of\r\naffairs. I mean to take steps immediately to remedy all that."\r\n\r\n"A bit of a Methody chapel, that\'s all," said the opposition shopkeeper;\r\n"and the schoolroom, as Mr Wentworth--"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I have heard of that," said the Rector, blandly;--somebody had\r\nadvised Mr Morgan to change his tactics, and this was the first\r\nevidence of the new policy--"I hear you have been doing what little\r\nyou could to mend matters. It is very laudable zeal in so young a man.\r\nBut, of course, as you were without authority, and had so little in\r\nyour power, it could only be a very temporary expedient. I am very\r\nmuch obliged to you for your good intentions."\r\n\r\n"I beg your pardon," said the Perpetual Curate, rousing up as at the\r\nsound of the trumpet, "I don\'t care in the least about my good\r\nintentions; but you have been much deceived if you have not understood\r\nthat there is a great work going on in Wharfside. I hope, Saunders, you\r\nhave had no hand in deceiving Mr Morgan. I shall be glad to show you my\r\nstatistics, which are more satisfactory than the town list," said Mr\r\nWentworth. "The schoolroom is consecrated; and but that I thought we had\r\nbetter work slowly and steadily, there is many a district in worse\r\ncondition which has its church and its incumbent. I shall be very happy\r\nto give you all possible information; it is best to go to the\r\nfountainhead."\r\n\r\n"The fountainhead!" said the Rector, who began not unnaturally to lose\r\nhis temper. "Are you aware, sir, that Wharfside is in my parish?"\r\n\r\n"And so is St Roque\'s, I suppose," said the Curate, affably. "I have\r\nno district, but I have my cure of souls all the same. As for\r\nWharfside, the Rector of Carlingford never had had anything to do with\r\nit. Mr Bury and Mr Proctor made it over to me. I act upon their\r\nauthority; but I should like to prove to you it is something more than\r\na temporary expedient," said the young Anglican, with a smile. Mr\r\nMorgan was gradually getting very hot and flushed. His temper got the\r\nbetter of him; he could not tolerate to be thus bearded on his own\r\nground.\r\n\r\n"It appears to me the most extraordinary assumption," said the Rector.\r\n"I can\'t fancy that you are ignorant of the law. I repeat, Wharfside\r\nis in my parish; and on what ground you can possibly justify such an\r\nincredible intrusion--"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps we might find a fitter place to discuss the matter," said the\r\nCurate, with great suavity. "If you care to go to the schoolroom, we\r\ncould be quiet there."\r\n\r\n"No, sir. I don\'t care to go to the schoolroom. I decline to have\r\nanything to do with such an unwarrantable attempt to interfere with my\r\nrights," said Mr Morgan. "I don\'t want to know what plausible arguments\r\nyou may have to justify yourself. The fact remains, sir, that Wharfside\r\nis in my parish. If you have anything to say against that, I will listen\r\nto you," said the irascible Rector. His Welsh blood was up; he even\r\nraised his voice a little, with a kind of half-feminine excitement,\r\ncommon to the Celtic race; and the consequence was that Mr Wentworth,\r\nwho stood perfectly calm to receive the storm, had all the advantage in\r\nthe world over Mr Morgan. The Perpetual Curate bowed with immovable\r\ncomposure, and felt himself master of the field.\r\n\r\n"In that case, it will perhaps be better not to say anything," he\r\nsaid; "but I think you will find difficulties in the way. Wharfside\r\nhas some curious privileges, and pays no rates; but I have never taken\r\nup that ground. The two previous rectors made it over to me, and the\r\nwork is too important to be ignored. I have had thoughts of applying\r\nto have it made into an ecclesiastical district," said the Curate,\r\nwith candour, "not thinking that the Rector of Carlingford, with so\r\nmuch to occupy him, would care to interfere with my labours; but at\r\nall events, to begin another mission here would be folly--it would be\r\ncopying the tactics of the Dissenters, if you will forgive me for\r\nsaying so," said Mr Wentworth, looking calmly in the Rector\'s face.\r\n\r\nIt was all Mr Morgan could do to restrain himself. "I am not in the\r\nhabit of being schooled by my--juniors," said the Rector, with\r\nsuppressed fury. He meant to say inferiors, but the aspect of the\r\nPerpetual Curate checked him. Then the two stood gazing at each other\r\nfor a minute in silence. "Anything further you may have to say, you\r\nwill perhaps communicate to my solicitor," said the elder priest. "It\r\nis well known that some gentlemen of your views, Mr Wentworth, think\r\nit safe to do evil that good may come;--that is not my opinion; and I\r\ndon\'t mean to permit any invasion of my rights. I have the pleasure of\r\nwishing you good morning."\r\n\r\nMr Morgan took off his hat, and gave it a little angry flourish in the\r\nair before he put it on again. He had challenged his young brother to\r\nthe only duel permitted by their cloth, and he turned to the\r\nopposition tradesman with vehemence, and went in again to the dusty\r\nlittle shop, where a humble assortment of groceries were displayed for\r\nthe consumption of Prickett\'s Lane. Mr Wentworth remained standing\r\noutside in much amazement, not to say amusement, and a general sense\r\nof awakening and recovery. Next to happiness, perhaps enmity is the\r\nmost healthful stimulant of the human mind. The Perpetual Curate woke\r\nup and realised his position with a sense of exhilaration, if the\r\ntruth must be told. He muttered something to himself, uncomplimentary\r\nto Mr Morgan\'s good sense, as he turned away; but it was astonishing\r\nto find how much more lively and interesting Prickett\'s Lane had\r\nbecome since that encounter. He went along cheerily, saying a word now\r\nand then to the people at the doors, every one of whom knew and\r\nrecognised him, and acknowledged, in a lesser or greater degree, the\r\nsway of his bishopric. The groups he addressed made remarks after he\r\nhad passed, which showed their sense of the improvement in his looks.\r\n"He\'s more like himsel\' than he\'s bin sin\' Easter," said one woman,\r\n"and none o\' that crossed look, as if things had gone contrairy;--Lord\r\nbless you, not cross--he\'s a deal too good a man for that--but\r\ncrossed-looking; it might be crossed in love for what I can tell."\r\n"Them as is handsome like that seldom gets crossed in love," said\r\nanother experienced observer; "but if it was fortin, or whatever it\r\nwas, there\'s ne\'er a one in Wharfside but wishes luck to the parson.\r\nIt aint much matter for us women. Them as won\'t strive to keep their\r\nchildren decent out o\' their own heads, they won\'t do much for a\r\nclergyman; but, bless you, he can do a deal with the men, and it\'s\r\nthem as wants looking after." "I\'d like to go to his wedding," said\r\nanother. "I\'d give a deal to hear it was all settled;" and amid these\r\naffectionate comments, Mr Wentworth issued out of Prickett\'s Lane. He\r\nwent direct to Mr Wodehouse\'s green door, without making any excuses\r\nto himself. For the first time for some weeks he went in upon the\r\nsisters and told them all that had happened as of old. Lucy was still\r\nin her grey cloak as she had returned from the district, and it was\r\nwith a feeling more distinct than sympathy that she heard of this\r\nthreatened attack. "It is terrible to think that he could interfere\r\nwith such a work out of jealousy of _us_," said the Sister of Charity,\r\nwith a wonderful light in her blue eyes; and she drew her low chair\r\nnearer, and listened with eloquent looks, which were balm to the soul\r\nof the Perpetual Curate. "But we are not to give up?" she said, giving\r\nhim her hand, when he rose to go away. "Never!" said Mr Wentworth; and\r\nif he held it more closely and longer than there was any particular\r\noccasion for, Lucy did not make any objection at that special moment.\r\nThen it turned out that he had business at the other end of the town, at\r\nthe north end, where some trustee lived who had to do with the Orphan\r\nSchools, and whom the curate was obliged to see; and Miss Wodehouse\r\ngave him a timid invitation to come back to dinner. "But you are not to\r\ngo home to dress; we shall be quite alone--and you must be so tired,"\r\nsaid the elder sister, who for some reason or other was shy of Mr\r\nWentworth, and kept away from him whenever he called. So he went in on\r\nhis way back, and dined in happiness and his morning coat, with a sweet\r\nconscious return to the familiar intercourse which these few disturbed\r\nweeks had interrupted. He was a different man when he went back again\r\ndown Grange Lane. Once more the darkness was fragrant and musical about\r\nhim. When he was tired thinking of his affairs, he fell back upon the\r\nmemories of the evening, and Lucy\'s looks and the "us" and "we," which\r\nwere so sweet to his ears. To have somebody behind whom one can fall\r\nback upon to fill up the interstices of thought--_that_ makes all the\r\ndifference, as Mr Wentworth found out, between a bright and a heavy\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nWhen he opened the garden-door with his key, and went softly in in the\r\ndarkness, the Perpetual Curate was much surprised to hear voices among\r\nthe trees. He waited a little, wondering, to see who it was; and\r\nprofound was his amazement when a minute after little Rosa Elsworthy,\r\nhastily tying her hat over her curls, came rapidly along the walk from\r\nunder the big walnut-tree, and essayed, with rather a tremulous hand,\r\nto open the door. Mr Wentworth stepped forward suddenly and laid his\r\nhand on her arm. He was very angry and indignant, and no longer the\r\nbenign superior being to whom Rosa was accustomed. "Whom have you been\r\ntalking to?" said the Curate. "Why are you here alone so late? What\r\ndoes this mean?" He held the door close, and looked down upon her\r\nseverely while he spoke. She made a frightened attempt to defend\r\nherself.\r\n\r\n"Oh, please, I only came with the papers. I was talking to--Sarah,"\r\nsaid the little girl, with a sob of shame and terror. "I will never do\r\nit again. Oh, please, _please_, let me go! Please, Mr Wentworth, let\r\nme go!"\r\n\r\n"How long have you been talking to--Sarah?" said the Curate. "Did you\r\never do it before? No, Rosa; I am going to take you home. This must\r\nnot happen any more."\r\n\r\n"I will run all the way. Oh, don\'t tell my aunt, Mr Wentworth. I didn\'t\r\nmean any harm," said the frightened creature. "You are not really\r\ncoming? Oh, Mr Wentworth, if you tell my aunt I shall die!" cried poor\r\nlittle Rosa. But she was hushed into awe and silence when the curate\r\nstalked forth, a grand, half-distinguished figure by her side, keeping\r\npace with her hasty, tremulous steps. She even stopped crying, in the\r\nwhirlwind of her feelings. What did he mean? Was he going to say\r\nanything to her? Was it possible that he could like her, and be jealous\r\nof her talk with--Sarah? Poor little foolish Rosa did not know what to\r\nthink. She had read a great many novels, and knew that it was quite\r\nusual for gentlemen to fall in love with pretty little girls who were\r\nnot of their own station;--why not with her? So she went on, half\r\nrunning, keeping up with Mr Wentworth, and sometimes stealing sly\r\nglances at him to see what intention was in his looks. But his looks\r\nwere beyond Rosa\'s reading. He walked by her side without speaking, and\r\ngave a glance up at the window of the summer-house as they passed. And\r\nstrange enough, that evening of all others, Miss Dora, who had been the\r\nvictim of some of Miss Leonora\'s caustic criticisms, had strayed forth,\r\nin melancholy mood, to repose herself at her favourite window, and look\r\nout at the faint stars, and comfort herself with a feeble repetition of\r\nher favourite plea, that it was not "my fault." The poor lady was\r\nstartled out of her own troubles by the sight of her nephew\'s tall\r\nunmistakable figure; and, as bad luck would have it, Rosa\'s hat, tied\r\ninsecurely by her agitated fingers, blew off at that moment, so that Mr\r\nWentworth\'s aunt became aware, to her inexpressible horror and\r\nastonishment, who his companion was. The unhappy Curate divined all the\r\nthoughts that would arise in her perturbed bosom, when he saw the\r\nindistinct figure at the window, and said something to himself about\r\n_espionage_, which was barely civil to Miss Dora, as he hurried along on\r\nhis charitable errand. He was out of one trouble into another, this\r\nunlucky young man. He knocked sharply at Elsworthy\'s closed door, and\r\ngave up his charge without speaking to Rosa. "I brought her home because\r\nI thought it wrong to let her go up Grange Lane by herself," said the\r\nCurate. "Don\'t thank me; but if you have any regard for the child, don\'t\r\nsend her out at night again." He did not even bid Rosa good-night, or\r\nlook back at her, as she stood blushing and sparkling in confused\r\nchildish beauty, in the doorway; but turned his back like any savage,\r\nand hastened home again. Before he entered his own apartments, he\r\nknocked at the door of the green room, and said something to the inmate\r\nthere which produced from that personage a growl of restrained defiance.\r\nAnd after all these fatigues, it was with a sense of relief that the\r\nCurate threw himself upon his sofa, to think over the events of the\r\nafternoon, and to take a little rest. He was very tired, and the\r\nconsolation he had experienced during the evening made him more disposed\r\nto yield to his fatigue. He threw himself upon the sofa, and stretched\r\nout his hand lazily for his letters, which evidently did not excite any\r\nspecial expectations in his mind. There was one from his sister, and one\r\nfrom an old university friend, full of the news of the season. Last of\r\nall, there was a neat little note, directed in a neat little hand, which\r\nanybody who received it would naturally have left to the last, as Mr\r\nWentworth did. He opened it quite deliberately, without any appearance\r\nof interest. But as he read the first lines, the Curate gradually\r\ngathered himself up off the sofa, and stretched out his hand for his\r\nboots, which he had just taken off; and before he had finished it, had\r\nwalked across the room and laid hold of the railway book in use at\r\nCarlingford, all the time reading and re-reading the important little\r\nepistle. It was not so neat inside as out, and blurred and blotted, and\r\nslightly illegible; and this is what the letter said:--\r\n\r\n\r\n "Oh, Frank, dear, I am so anxious and unhappy about Gerald. I can\'t\r\n tell what is the matter with him. Come directly, for heaven\'s sake,\r\n and tell me what you think, and try what you can do. Don\'t lose a\r\n train after you get this, but come directly--oh, come if you ever\r\n loved any of us. I don\'t know what he means, but he says the most\r\n awful things; and if he is not _mad_, as I sometimes hope, he has\r\n forgotten his duty to his family and to me, which is far worse. I\r\n can\'t explain more; but if there is any chance of anybody doing him\r\n good, it is you. I beg you, on my knees, come directly, dear Frank. I\r\n never was in such a state in my life. I shall be left so that nobody\r\n will be able to tell what I am; and my heart is bursting. Never mind\r\n business or anything; but come, come directly, whether it is night or\r\n day, to your broken-hearted sister,\r\n\r\n "LOUISA."\r\n\r\n "_P.S._--In great haste, and _so_ anxious to see you."\r\n\r\nHalf an hour after, Mr Wentworth, with a travelling-bag in his hand, was\r\nonce more hastening up Grange Lane towards the railway station. His face\r\nwas somewhat grey, as the lamps shone on it. He did not exactly know\r\nwhat he was anxious about, nor what might have happened at Wentworth\r\nRectory before he could get there; but the express train felt slow to\r\nhis anxious thoughts as it flashed out of the station. Mr Morgan and his\r\nwife were in their garden, talking about the encounter in Prickett\'s\r\nLane, when the train plunged past, waking all the echoes; and Mrs\r\nMorgan, by way of making a diversion, appealed to the Rector about those\r\ncreepers, with which she hoped in a year or two to shut out the sight of\r\nthe railway. "The Virginian creeper would be the best," said the\r\nRector\'s wife; and they went in to calculate the expenses of bringing Mr\r\nWentworth before Dr Lushington. Miss Dora, at very nearly the same\r\nmoment, was confiding to her sister Cecilia, under vows of secrecy, the\r\nterrible sight she had seen from the summer-house window. They went to\r\nbed with very sad hearts in consequence, both these good women. In the\r\nmean time, leaving all these gathering clouds behind him, leaving his\r\nreputation and his work to be discussed and quarrelled over as they\r\nmight, the Perpetual Curate rushed through the night, his heart aching\r\nwith trouble and anxiety, to help, if he could--and if not, at least to\r\nstand by--Gerald, in this unknown crisis of his brother\'s life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Dora Wentworth rose very unrefreshed next morning from her\r\ndisturbed slumbers. It was hard to sit at breakfast with Leonora, and\r\nnot betray to her the new anxiety; and the troubled sister ran into a\r\ncountless number of digressions, which would have inevitably betrayed\r\nher had not Miss Leonora been at the moment otherwise occupied. She\r\nhad her little budget of letters as usual, and some of them were more\r\nthan ordinarily interesting. She too had a favourite district, which\r\nwas in London, and where also a great work was going on; and her\r\nmissionary, and her Scripture-readers, and her colporteur were all in\r\na wonderful state of excitement about a new gin-palace which was being\r\nfitted out and decorated in the highest style of art on the borders of\r\ntheir especial domain. They were moving heaven and earth to prevent\r\nthis temple of Satan from being licensed; and some of them were so\r\nvery certain of the Divine acquiescence in their measures, that they\r\nannounced the success of their exertions to be a test of the\r\nfaithfulness of God; which Miss Leonora read out to her sisters as an\r\ninstance of very touching and beautiful faith. Miss Wentworth,\r\nperhaps, was not so clear on that subject. During the course of her\r\nsilent life, she had prayed for various things which it had not been\r\nGod\'s pleasure to grant; and just now she, too, was very anxious about\r\nFrank, who seemed to be in a bad way; so she rather shook her head\r\ngently, though she did not contravene the statement, and concluded\r\nwith sadness that the government of the earth might still go on as\r\nusual, and God\'s goodness remain as certain as ever, even though the\r\npublic-house was licensed, or Frank did fall away. This was the\r\nteaching of experience; but aunt Cecilia did not utter it, for that\r\nwas not her way. As for Miss Dora, she agreed in all the colporteur\'s\r\nsentiments, and thought them beautiful, as Leonora said, and was not\r\nmuch disturbed by any opinion of her own, expressed or unexpressed,\r\nbut interspersed her breakfast with little sighing ejaculations of the\r\ntemptations of the world, and how little one knew what was passing\r\naround one, and "let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he\r\nfall," which could not have failed to attract Miss Leonora\'s\r\nattention, and draw forth the whole story of her sister\'s suspicions,\r\nhad not that quick-witted iron-grey woman been, as we have already\r\nmentioned, too deeply engaged. Perhaps her nephew\'s imaginary\r\nbacksliding might have excited even Miss Leonora to an interest deeper\r\nthan that which was awakened by the new gin-palace; but as it\r\nhappened, it was the humbler intelligence alone which occupied itself\r\nwith the supposed domestic calamity. Miss Dora\'s breakfast was\r\naffected by it in a way which did not appear in the morning meal of\r\nher sister; for somehow the most fervent love of souls seldom takes\r\naway the appetite, as the love of some unlucky individual occasionally\r\ndoes.\r\n\r\nWhen breakfast was over, Miss Dora made a very elaborate excuse for\r\ngoing out by herself. She wanted to match some wool for a blanket she\r\nwas making, "For Louisa\'s baby," the devoted aunt said, with a little\r\ntremor. "Poor Louisa! if Gerald were to go any further, you know, it\r\nwould be so sad for her; and one would like to help to keep up her\r\nheart, poor dear, as much as one could."\r\n\r\n"By means of a blanket for the bassinet in scarlet and white," said\r\nMiss Leonora; "but it\'s quite the kind of comfort for Louisa. I wonder\r\nif she ever had the smallest inkling what kind of a husband she has\r\ngot. I don\'t think Frank is far wrong about Gerald, though I don\'t pin\r\nmy faith to my nephew\'s judgment. I daresay he\'ll go mad or do worse\r\nwith all those crotchets of his--but what he married Louisa for has\r\nalways been a mystery to me."\r\n\r\n"I suppose because he was very fond of her," suggested Miss Dora, with\r\nhumility.\r\n\r\n"But why was he fond of her?--a goose!" said the strong-minded sister,\r\nand so went about her letter-writing without further comment, leaving\r\naunt Dora to pursue her independent career. It was with a feeling of\r\nrelief, and yet of guilt, that this timid inquirer set forth on her\r\nmission, exchanging a sympathetic significant look with Miss Wentworth\r\nbefore she went out. If she should meet Frank at the door, looking\r\ndignified and virtuous, what could she possibly say to him? and yet,\r\nperhaps, he had only been imprudent, and did not mean anything. Miss\r\nDora looked round her on both sides, up and down Grange Lane, as she\r\nwent out into the lovely summer morning. Neither Frank nor any other\r\nsoul, except some nurse-maids, was to be seen along the whole line of\r\nsunny road. She was relieved, yet she was disappointed at the same\r\ntime, and went slowly up towards Elsworthy\'s shop, saying to herself\r\nthat she was sure Frank could not mean anything. It must have been\r\nthat forward little thing herself who had come up to him when he was\r\nout for his walk, or it must have been an accident. But then she\r\nremembered that she had heard the Curate call Rosa pretty; and Miss\r\nDora wondered within herself what it mattered whether she was pretty\r\nor not, and what he had to do with it, and shook her head over the\r\nstrange way men had of finding out such things. For her own part, she\r\nwas sure she never looked whether the girl was pretty or not; and the\r\nanxious aunt had just come round again, by a very circuitous and\r\nperplexing course, to her original sentiment, and strengthened herself\r\nin the thought that her dear Frank could not mean anything, when she\r\nreached Elsworthy\'s door.\r\n\r\nThat worthy trader was himself behind the counter, managing matters\r\nwith his usual exactness. Berlin wool was one of the articles Mr\r\nElsworthy dealt in, besides newspapers, and books when they were\r\nordered. Miss Dora, who wore no crinoline, stumbled over her dress in\r\nher agitation as she went in, and saw, at the first glance, little\r\nRosa, looking very blooming and pretty, tying up a parcel at the other\r\nend of the shop. The poor lady did not know how to enter upon so\r\ndifficult a question. She offered her wool humbly to be matched, and\r\nlistened to Mr Elsworthy\'s sentiments on the subject. He told her how\r\nhe always had his wools from the best houses in London, and could\r\nmatch anything as was ever made in that line, and was proud to say as\r\nhe always gave satisfaction. Miss Dora could not see any opening for\r\nthe inquiries she hoped to make; for how was it possible to intimate\r\nthe possibility of disapproval to an establishment so perfect in all\r\nits arrangements? The probabilities are, that she would have gone away\r\nwithout saying anything, had not Mr Elsworthy himself given her a\r\nchance.\r\n\r\n"Miss Wodehouse has been my great help," said the shopkeeper; "she is\r\nthe nicest lady, is Miss Wodehouse, in all Carlingford. I do respect\r\nthem people; they\'ve had their troubles, like most families, but there\r\naint many as can lay their finger on the skeleton as is in their\r\ncupboard: they\'ve kept things close, and there aint a many as knows;\r\nbut Miss Wodehouse has spoke up for me, ma\'am, right and left, and\r\nmost persons as count for anything in Carlingford gets their fancy\r\narticles out o\' my shop. Mr Wentworth, ma\'am, our respected clergyman,\r\ngets all his papers of me--and partickler he is to a degree--and\r\nlikes to have \'em first thing afore they\'re opened out o\' the parcel.\r\nIt\'s the way with gentlemen when they\'re young. Mostly people aint so\r\npartickler later in life--not as I could tell the reason why, unless\r\nit may be that folks gets used to most things, and stop looking for\r\nanything new. But there aint a many young gentlemen like our\r\nclergyman, though I say it as shouldn\'t," continued Mr Elsworthy, with\r\na little effusion, as he succeeded in finding an exact match for the\r\nscarlet wool.\r\n\r\n"And why shouldn\'t you say it, Mr Elsworthy?" said Miss Dora, a little\r\ntartly; "you are not in any way particularly connected with my\r\nnephew." Here she gave an angry glance at Rosa, who had drawn near to\r\nlisten, having always in her vain little heart a certain palpitation\r\nat Mr Wentworth\'s name.\r\n\r\n"I ask your pardon, ma\'am; I\'m clerk at St Roque\'s. It aint often as\r\nwe have the pleasure of seeing you there--more\'s the pity," said the\r\nchurch official, "though I may say there aint a church as perfect, or\r\nwhere the duty is performed more beautiful, in all the country; and\r\nthere never was a clergyman as had the people\'s good at heart like Mr\r\nWentworth--not in my time. It aint no matter whether you\'re rich or\r\npoor, young or old, if there\'s a service as can be done to ever a one\r\nin his way, our clergyman is the man to do it. Why, no further gone\r\nthan last night, ma\'am, if you\'ll believe me, that little girl\r\nthere--"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Miss Dora, eagerly, looking with what was intended to be a\r\nvery stern and forbidding aspect in the little girl\'s face.\r\n\r\n"She was a-coming up Grange Lane in the dark," said Mr Elsworthy--"not\r\nas there was any need, and me keeping two boys, but she likes a run\r\nout of an evening--when Mr Wentworth see her, and come up to her. It\r\naint what many men would have done," said the admiring but unlucky\r\nadherent of the suspected Curate: "he come up, seeing as she was by\r\nherself, and walked by her, and gave her a deal of good advice, and\r\nbrought her home. Her aunt and me was struck all of a heap to see the\r\nclergyman a-standing at our door. \'I\'ve brought Rosa home,\' he said,\r\nmaking believe a bit sharp. \'Don\'t send her out no more so late at\r\nnight,\' and was off like a shot, not waiting for no thanks. It\'s my\r\nopinion as there aint many such gentlemen. I can\'t call to mind as I\r\never met with his fellow before."\r\n\r\n"But a young creature like that ought not to have been out so late,"\r\nsaid Miss Dora, trying to harden herself into severity. "I wonder very\r\nmuch that you like to walk up Grange Lane in the dark. I should think\r\nit very unpleasant, for my part; and I am sure I would not allow it,\r\nMr Elsworthy," she said firmly, "if such a girl belonged to me."\r\n\r\n"But, please, I wasn\'t walking up Grange Lane," said Rosa, with some\r\nhaste. "I was at Mrs Hadwin\'s, where Mr Wentworth lives. I am sure I\r\ndid not want to trouble him," said the little beauty, recovering her\r\nnatural spirit as she went on, "but he insisted on walking with me; it\r\nwas all his own doing. I am sure I didn\'t want him;" and here Rosa\r\nbroke off abruptly, with a consciousness in her heart that she was\r\nbeing lectured. She rushed to her defensive weapons by natural\r\ninstinct, and grew crimson all over her pretty little face, and\r\nflashed lightning out of her eyes, which at the same time were not\r\ndisinclined to tears. All this Miss Dora made note of with a sinking\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n"Do you mean to say that you went to Mrs Hadwin\'s to see Mr\r\nWentworth?" asked that unlucky inquisitor, with a world of horror in\r\nher face.\r\n\r\n"I went with the papers," said Rosa, "and I--I met him in the garden.\r\nI am sure it wasn\'t my fault," said the girl, bursting into petulant\r\ntears. "Nobody has any occasion to scold me. It was Mr Wentworth as\r\nwould come;" and Rosa sobbed, and lighted up gleams of defiance behind\r\nher tears. Miss Dora sat looking at her with a very troubled, pale\r\nface. She thought all her fears were true, and matters worse than she\r\nimagined; and being quite unused to private inquisitions, of course\r\nshe took all possible steps to create the scandal for which she had\r\ncome to look.\r\n\r\n"Did you ever meet him in the garden before?" asked Miss Dora,\r\npainfully, in a low voice. During this conversation Mr Elsworthy had\r\nbeen looking on, perplexed, not perceiving the drift of the\r\nexamination. He roused himself up to answer now--a little alarmed, to\r\ntell the truth, by the new lights thrown on the subject, and vexed to\r\nsee how unconsciously far both the women had gone.\r\n\r\n"It aint easy to go into a house in Grange Lane without meeting of\r\nsome one in the garden," said Mr Elsworthy; "not as I mean to say it\r\nwas the right thing for Rosa to be going them errands after dark. My\r\norders is against that, as she knows; and what\'s the good of keeping\r\ntwo boys if things isn\'t to be done at the right time? Mr Wentworth\r\nhimself was a-reproving of me for sending out Rosa, as it might be the\r\nlast time he was here; for she\'s one of them as sits in the chancel\r\nand helps in the singing, and he feels an interest in her, natural,"\r\nsaid the apologetic clerk. Miss Dora gave him a troubled look, but\r\ntook no further notice of his speech. She thought, with an instinctive\r\ncontempt for the masculine spectator, that it was impossible he could\r\nknow anything about it, and pursued her own wiser way.\r\n\r\n"It is very wrong of you--a girl in your position," said Miss Dora, as\r\nseverely as she could in her soft old voice, "to be seen walking about\r\nwith a gentleman, even when he is your clergyman, and, of course, has\r\nnothing else in his head. Young men don\'t think anything of it," said\r\nthe rash but timid preacher; "of course it was only to take care of you,\r\nand keep you out of harm\'s way. But then you ought to think what a\r\ntrouble it was to Mr Wentworth, taking him away from his studies--and it\r\nis not nice for a young girl like you." Miss Dora paused to take breath,\r\nnot feeling quite sure in her own mind whether this was the right thing\r\nto say. Perhaps it would have been better to have disbelieved the fact\r\naltogether, and declared it impossible. She was much troubled about it,\r\nas she stood looking into the flushed tearful face, with all that light\r\nof defiance behind the tears, and felt instinctively that little Rosa,\r\nstill only a pretty, obstinate, vain, uneducated little girl, was more\r\nthan a match for herself, with all her dearly-won experiences. The\r\nlittle thing was bristling with a hundred natural weapons and defences,\r\nagainst which Miss Dora\'s weak assault had no chance.\r\n\r\n"If it was a trouble, he need not have come," said Rosa, more and more\r\nconvinced that Mr Wentworth must certainly have meant something. "I am\r\nsure _I_ did not want him. He insisted on coming, though I begged him\r\nnot. I don\'t know why I should be spoke to like this," cried the little\r\ncoquette, with tears, "for I never was one as looked at a gentleman;\r\nit\'s them," with a sob, "as comes after me."\r\n\r\n"Rosa," said Mr Elsworthy, much alarmed, "your aunt is sure to be\r\nlooking out for you, and I don\'t want you here, not now; nor I don\'t\r\nwant you again for errands, and don\'t you forget. If it hadn\'t been that\r\nMr Wentworth thought you a silly little thing, and had a kind feeling\r\nfor my missis and me, you don\'t think he\'d have took that charge of\r\nyou?--and I won\'t have my clergyman, as has always been good to me and\r\nmine, made a talk of. You\'ll excuse me, ma\'am," he said, in an under\r\ntone, as Rosa reluctantly went away--not to her aunt, however, but again\r\nto her parcel at the other end of the shop--"she aint used to being\r\ntalked to. She\'s but a child, and don\'t know no better: and after all,"\r\nsaid Rosa\'s uncle, with a little pride, "she is a tender-hearted little\r\nthing--she don\'t know no better, ma\'am; she\'s led away by a kind\r\nword--for nobody can say but she\'s wonderful pretty, as is very plain to\r\nsee."\r\n\r\n"Is she?" said Miss Dora, following the little culprit to the\r\nback-counter with disenchanted eyes. "Then you had better take all the\r\nbetter care of her, Mr Elsworthy," she said, with again a little\r\nasperity. The fact was, that Miss Dora had behaved very injudiciously,\r\nand was partly aware of it; and then this prettiness of little Rosa\'s,\r\neven though it shone at the present moment before her, was not so plain\r\nto her old-maidenly eyes. She did not make out why everybody was so sure\r\nof it, nor what it mattered; and very probably, if she could have had\r\nher own way, would have liked to give the little insignificant thing a\r\ngood shake, and asked her how she dared to attract the eye of the\r\nPerpetual Curate. As she could not do this, however, Miss Dora gathered\r\nup her wool, and refused to permit Mr Elsworthy to send it home for her.\r\n"I can carry it quite well myself," said the indignant little woman. "I\r\nam sure you must have a great deal too much for your boys to do, or you\r\nwould not send your niece about with the things. But if you will take my\r\nadvice, Mr Elsworthy," said Miss Dora, "you will take care of that poor\r\nlittle thing: she will be getting ridiculous notions into her head;" and\r\naunt Dora went out of the shop with great solemnity, quite unaware that\r\nshe had done more to put ridiculous notions into Rosa\'s head than could\r\nhave got there by means of a dozen darkling walks by the side of the\r\nmajestic Curate, who never paid her any compliments. Miss Dora went away\r\nmore than ever convinced in her mind that Frank had forgotten himself\r\nand his position, and everything that was fit and seemly. She jumped to\r\na hundred horrible conclusions as she went sadly across Grange Lane with\r\nher scarlet wool in her hand. What Leonora would say to such an\r\nirremediable folly?--and how the Squire would receive his son after such\r\na _m\xe9salliance_? "He might change his views," said poor Miss Dora to\r\nherself, "but he could not change his wife;" and it was poor comfort to\r\ncall Rosa a designing little wretch, and to reflect that Frank at first\r\ncould not have meant anything. The poor lady had a bad headache, and was\r\nin a terribly depressed condition all day. When she saw from the window\r\nof her summer-house the pretty figure of Lucy Wodehouse in her grey\r\ncloak pass by, she sank into tears and melancholy reflections. But then\r\nLucy Wodehouse\'s views were highly objectionable, and she bethought\r\nherself of Julia Trench, who had long ago been selected by the sisters\r\nas the clergyman\'s wife of Skelmersdale. Miss Dora shook her head over\r\nthe blanket she was knitting for Louisa\'s baby, thinking of clergymen\'s\r\nwives in general, and the way in which marriages came about. Who had the\r\nordering of these inexplicable accidents? It was surely not Providence,\r\nbut some tricky imp or other who loved confusion; and then Miss Dora\r\npaused with compunction, and hoped she would be forgiven for\r\nentertaining, even for one passing moment, such a wicked, wicked\r\nthought.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of the same day Mr Morgan went home late, and\r\nfrightened his wife out of her propriety by the excitement and trouble\r\nin his face. He could do nothing but groan as he sat down in the\r\ndrawing-room, where she had just been gathering her work together, and\r\nputting stray matters in order, before she went up-stairs to make\r\nherself tidy for dinner. The Rector paid no attention to the fact that\r\nthe dinner-hour was approaching, and only shook his head and repeated\r\nhis groan when she asked him anxiously what was the matter. The good\r\nman was too much flushed and heated and put out, to be able at first\r\nto answer her questions.\r\n\r\n"Very bad, very bad," he said, when he had recovered sufficient\r\ncomposure--"far worse than I feared. My dear, I am afraid the\r\nbeginning of my work in Carlingford will be for ever associated with\r\npain to us both. I am discouraged and distressed beyond measure by\r\nwhat I have heard to-day."\r\n\r\n"Dear William, tell me what it is," said the Rector\'s wife.\r\n\r\n"I feared it was a bad business from the first," said the disturbed\r\nRector. "I confess I feared, when I saw a young man so regardless of\r\nlawful authority, that his moral principles must be defective, but I\r\nwas not prepared for what I have heard to-day. My dear, I am sorry to\r\ngrieve you with such a story; but as you are sure to hear it, perhaps\r\nit is better that you should have the facts from me."\r\n\r\n"It must be about Mr Wentworth," said Mrs Morgan. She was sorry; for\r\nthough she had given in to her husband\'s vehemence, she herself in her\r\nown person had always been prepossessed in favour of the Perpetual\r\nCurate; but she was also sensible of a feeling of relief to know that\r\nthe misfortune concerned Mr Wentworth, and was not specially connected\r\nwith themselves.\r\n\r\n"Yes, it\'s about Mr Wentworth," said the Rector. He wiped his face,\r\nwhich was red with haste and exhaustion, and shook his head. He was\r\nsincerely shocked and grieved, to do him justice; but underneath there\r\nwas also a certain satisfaction in the thought that he had foreseen\r\nit, and that his suspicions were verified. "My dear, I am very glad he\r\nhad not become intimate in our house," said Mr Morgan; "that would\r\nhave complicated matters sadly. I rejoice that your womanly instincts\r\nprevented that inconvenience;" and as the Rector began to recover\r\nhimself, he looked more severe than ever.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Mrs Morgan, with hesitation; for the truth was, that her\r\nwomanly instincts had pronounced rather distinctly in favour of the\r\nCurate of St Roque\'s. "I hope he has not done anything very wrong,\r\nWilliam. I should be very sorry; for I think he has very good\r\nqualities," said the Rector\'s wife. "We must not let our personal\r\nobjections prejudice us in respect to his conduct otherwise. I am sure\r\nyou are the last to do that."\r\n\r\n"I have never known an insubordinate man who was a perfect moral\r\ncharacter," said the Rector. "It is very discouraging altogether; and\r\nyou thought he was engaged to Wodehouse\'s pretty daughter, didn\'t you?\r\nI hope not--I sincerely hope not. That would make things doubly bad;\r\nbut, to be sure, when a man is faithless to his most sacred\r\nengagements, there is very little dependence to be placed on him in\r\nother respects."\r\n\r\n"But you have not told me what it is," said the Rector\'s wife, with\r\nsome anxiety; and she spoke the more hastily as she saw the shadow of\r\na curate--Mr Morgan\'s own curate, who must inevitably be invited to\r\nstop to dinner--crossing the lawn as she spoke. She got up and went a\r\nlittle nearer the window to make sure. "There is Mr Leeson," she said,\r\nwith some vexation. "I must run up-stairs and get ready for dinner.\r\nTell me what it is!"\r\n\r\nUpon which the Rector, with some circumlocution, described the\r\nappalling occurrence of the previous night,--how Mr Wentworth had\r\nwalked home with little Rosa Elsworthy from his own house to hers, as\r\nhad, of course, been seen by various people. The tale had been told\r\nwith variations, which did credit to the ingenuity of Carlingford; and\r\nMr Morgan\'s version was that they had walked arm in arm, in the\r\nclosest conversation, and at an hour which was quite unseemly for such\r\na little person as Rosa to be abroad. The excellent Rector gave the\r\nstory with strong expressions of disapproval; for he was aware of\r\nhaving raised his wife\'s expectations, and had a feeling, as he\r\nrelated them, that the circumstances, after all, were scarcely\r\nsufficiently horrifying to justify his preamble. Mrs Morgan listened\r\nwith one ear towards the door, on the watch for Mr Leeson\'s knock.\r\n\r\n"Was that all?" said the sensible woman. "I think it very likely it\r\nmight be explained. I suppose Mr Leeson must have stopped to look at\r\nmy ferns; he is very tiresome with his botany. That was all! Dear, I\r\nthink it might be explained. I can\'t fancy Mr Wentworth is a man to\r\ncommit himself in that way--if that is all!" said Mrs Morgan; "but I\r\nmust run up-stairs to change my dress."\r\n\r\n"That was not all," said the Rector, following her to the door. "It is\r\nsaid that this sort of thing has been habitual, my dear. He takes the\r\n\'Evening Mail,\' you know, all to himself, instead of having the\r\n\'Times\' like other people, and she carries it down to his house, and I\r\nhear of meetings in the garden, and a great deal that is very\r\nobjectionable," said Mr Morgan, speaking very fast in order to deliver\r\nhimself before the advent of Mr Leeson. "I\'m afraid it is a very bad\r\nbusiness. I don\'t know what to do about it. I suppose I must ask\r\nLeeson to stay to dinner? It is absurd of him to come at six o\'clock."\r\n\r\n"Meetings in the garden?" said Mrs Morgan, aghast. "I don\'t feel as if\r\nI could believe it. There is that tiresome man at last. Do as you\r\nlike, dear, about asking him to stay; but I must make my escape," and\r\nthe Rector\'s wife hastened up-stairs, divided between vexation about\r\nMr Leeson and regret at the news she had just heard. She put on her\r\ndress rather hastily, and was conscious of a little ill-temper, for\r\nwhich she was angry with herself; and the haste of her toilette, and\r\nthe excitement under which she laboured, aggravated unbecomingly that\r\nredness of which Mrs Morgan was painfully sensible. She was not at all\r\npleased with her own appearance as she looked in the glass. Perhaps\r\nthat sense of looking not so well as usual brought back to her mind a\r\ntroublesome and painful idea, which recurred to her not unfrequently\r\nwhen she was in any trouble. The real Rector to whom she was married\r\nwas so different from the ideal one who courted her; could it be\r\npossible, if they had married in their youth instead of now, that her\r\nhusband would have been less open to the ill-natured suggestions of\r\nthe gossips in Carlingford, and less jealous of the interferences of\r\nhis young neighbour? It was hard to think that all the self-denial and\r\npatience of the past had done more harm than good; but though she was\r\nconscious of his defects, she was very loyal to him, and resolute to\r\nstand by him whatever he might do or say; though Mrs Morgan\'s "womanly\r\ninstincts," which the Rector had quoted, were all on Mr Wentworth\'s\r\nside, and convinced her of his innocence to start with. On the whole,\r\nshe was annoyed and uncomfortable; what with Mr Leeson\'s intrusion\r\n(which had occurred three or four times before, and which Mrs Morgan\r\nfelt it her duty to check) and the Rector\'s uncharitableness, and her\r\nown insufficient time to dress, and the disagreeable heightening of\r\nher complexion, the Rector\'s wife felt in rather an unchristian frame\r\nof mind. She did not look well, and she did not feel better. She was\r\nterribly civil to the Curate when she went down-stairs, and snubbed\r\nhim in the most unqualified way when he too began to speak about Mr\r\nWentworth. "It does not seem to me to be at all a likely story," she\r\nsaid, courageously, and took away Mr Leeson\'s breath.\r\n\r\n"But I hear a very unfavourable general account," said the Rector, who\r\nwas almost equally surprised. "I hear he has been playing fast and loose\r\nwith that very pretty person, Miss Wodehouse, and that her friends begin\r\nto be indignant. It is said that he has not been nearly so much there\r\nlately, but, on the contrary, always going to Elsworthy\'s, and has\r\npartly educated this little thing. My dear, one false step leads to\r\nanother. I am not so incredulous as you are. Perhaps I have studied\r\nhuman nature a little more closely, and I know that error is always\r\nfruitful;--that is my experience," said Mr Morgan. His wife did not say\r\nanything in answer to this deliverance, but she lay in wait for the\r\nCurate, as was natural, and had her revenge upon him as soon as his ill\r\nfate prompted him to back the Rector out.\r\n\r\n"I am afraid Mr Wentworth had always too much confidence in himself,"\r\nsaid the unlucky individual who was destined to be scapegoat on this\r\noccasion; "and as you very justly observe, one wrong act leads to\r\nanother. He has thrown himself among the bargemen on such an equal\r\nfooting that I daresay he has got to like that kind of society. I\r\nshouldn\'t be surprised to find that Rosa Elsworthy suited him better\r\nthan a lady with refined tastes."\r\n\r\n"Mr Wentworth is a gentleman," said the Rector\'s wife, with emphasis,\r\ncoming down upon the unhappy Leeson in full battle array. "I don\'t think\r\nhe would go into the poorest house, if it were even a bargeman\'s,\r\nwithout the same respect of the privacy of the family as is customary\r\namong--persons of our own class, Mr Leeson. I can\'t tell how wrong or\r\nhow foolish he may have been, of course--but that he couldn\'t behave to\r\nanybody in a disrespectful manner, or show himself intrusive, or forget\r\nthe usages of good society," said Mrs Morgan, who was looking all the\r\ntime at the unfortunate Curate, "I am perfectly convinced."\r\n\r\nIt was this speech which made Mr Morgan "speak seriously," as he\r\ncalled it, later the same night, to his wife, about her manner to poor\r\nLeeson, who was totally extinguished, as was to be expected. Mrs\r\nMorgan busied herself among her flowers all the evening, and could not\r\nbe caught to be admonished until it was time for prayers: so that it\r\nwas in the sacred retirement of her own chamber that the remonstrance\r\nwas delivered at last. The Rector said he was very sorry to find that\r\nshe still gave way to temper in a manner that was unbecoming in a\r\nclergyman\'s wife; he was surprised, after all her experience, and the\r\nway in which they had both been schooled in patience, to find she had\r\nstill to learn that lesson: upon which Mrs Morgan, who had been\r\nthinking much on the subject, broke forth upon her husband in a manner\r\ntotally unprecedented, and which took the amazed Rector altogether by\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\n"Oh, William, if we had only forestalled the lesson, and been _less_\r\nprudent!" she cried in a womanish way, which struck the Rector dumb\r\nwith astonishment; "if we hadn\'t been afraid to marry ten years ago,\r\nbut gone into life when we were young, and fought through it like so\r\nmany people, don\'t you think it would have been better for us? Neither\r\nyou nor I would have minded what gossips said, or listened to a pack\r\nof stories when we were five-and-twenty. I think I was better then\r\nthan I am now," said the Rector\'s wife. Though she filled that\r\nelevated position, she was only a woman, subject to outbreaks of\r\nsudden passion, and liable to tears like the rest. Mr Morgan looked\r\nvery blank at her as she sat there crying, sobbing with the force of a\r\nsentiment which was probably untranslatable to the surprised,\r\nmiddle-aged man. He thought it must be her nerves which were in fault\r\nsomehow, and though much startled, did not inquire farther into it,\r\nhaving a secret feeling in his heart that the less that was said the\r\nbetter on that subject. So he did what his good angel suggested to\r\nhim, kissed his wife, and said he was well aware what heavy calls he\r\nhad made upon her patience, and soothed her the best way that occurred\r\nto him. "But you were very hard upon poor Leeson, my dear," said the\r\nRector, with his puzzled look, when she had regained her composure.\r\nPerhaps she was disappointed that she had not been able to convey her\r\nreal meaning to her husband\'s matter-of-fact bosom; at all events, Mrs\r\nMorgan recovered herself immediately, and flashed forth with all the\r\nlively freshness of a temper in its first youth.\r\n\r\n"He deserved a great deal more than I said to him," said the Rector\'s\r\nwife. "It might be an advantage to take the furniture, as it was all\r\nnew, though it is a perpetual vexation to me, and worries me out of my\r\nlife; but there was no need to take the curate, that I can see. What\r\nright has he to come day after day at your dinner-hour? he knows we\r\ndine at six as well as we do ourselves; and I do believe he knows what\r\nwe have for dinner," exclaimed the incensed mistress of the house;\r\n"for he always makes his appearance when we have anything he likes. I\r\nhope I know my duty, and can put up with what cannot be mended,"\r\ncontinued Mrs Morgan, with a sigh, and a mental reference to the\r\ncarpet in the drawing-room; "but there are some things really that\r\nwould disturb the temper of an angel. I don\'t know anybody that could\r\nendure the sight of a man always coming unasked to dinner;--and he to\r\nspeak of Mr Wentworth, who, if he were the greatest sinner in the\r\nworld, is _always_ a gentleman!" Mrs Morgan broke off with a sparkle\r\nin her eye, which showed that she had neither exhausted the subject,\r\nnor was ashamed of herself; and the Rector wisely retired from the\r\ncontroversy. He went to bed, and slept, good man, and dreamt that Sir\r\nCharles Grandison had come to be his curate in place of Mr Leeson; and\r\nwhen he woke, concluded quietly that Mrs Morgan had "experienced a\r\nlittle attack on the nerves," as he explained afterwards to Dr\r\nMarjoribanks. Her compunctions, her longings after the lost life they\r\nmight have lived together, her wistful womanish sense of the\r\nimpoverished existence, deprived of so many experiences, on which they\r\nhad entered in the dry maturity of their middle age, remained for ever\r\na mystery to her faithful husband. He was very fond of her, and had a\r\nhigh respect for her character; but if she had spoken Sanscrit, he\r\ncould not have had less understanding of the meaning her words were\r\nintended to convey.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding, a vague idea that his wife was disposed to side with\r\nMr Wentworth had penetrated the brain of the Rector, and was not\r\nwithout its results. He told her next morning, in his curt way, that\r\nhe thought it would be best to wait a little before taking any steps\r\nin the Wharfside business. "If all I hear is true, we may have to\r\nproceed in a different way against the unhappy young man," said Mr\r\nMorgan, solemnly; and he took care to ascertain that Mr Leeson had an\r\ninvitation somewhere else to dinner, which was doing the duty of a\r\ntender husband, as everybody will allow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n"I want to know what all this means about young Wentworth," said Mr\r\nWodehouse. "He\'s gone off, it appears, in a hurry, nobody knows where.\r\nWell, so they say. To his brother\'s, is it? _I_ couldn\'t know that;\r\nbut look here--that\'s not all, nor nearly all--they say he meets that\r\nlittle Rosa at Elsworthy\'s every night, and walks home with her, and\r\nall that sort of thing. I tell you I don\'t know--that\'s what people\r\nsay. You ought to understand all the rights of it, you two girls. I\r\nconfess I thought it was Lucy he was after, for my part--and a very\r\nbad match, too, and one I should never have given my consent to. And\r\nthen there is another fine talk about some fellow he\'s got at his\r\nhouse. What\'s the matter, Molly?--she looks as if she was going to\r\nfaint."\r\n\r\n"Oh no," said Miss Wodehouse, faintly; "and I don\'t believe a word\r\nabout Rosa Elsworthy," she said, with sudden impetuosity, a minute\r\nafter. "I am sure Mr Wentworth could vindicate himself whenever he\r\nlikes. I daresay the one story is just as true as the other; but\r\nthen," said the gentle elder sister, turning with anxious looks\r\ntowards Lucy, "he is proud, as is natural; and I shouldn\'t think he\r\nwould enter into explanations if he thought people did not trust him\r\nwithout them."\r\n\r\n"That is all stuff," said Mr Wodehouse; "why should people trust him? I\r\ndon\'t understand trusting a man in all sorts of equivocal circumstances,\r\nbecause he\'s got dark eyes, &c., and a handsome face--which seems _your_\r\ncode of morality; but I thought he was after Lucy--that was my\r\nbelief--and I want to know if it\'s all off."\r\n\r\n"It never was on, papa," said Lucy, in her clearest voice. "I have been\r\na great deal in the district, you know, and Mr Wentworth and I could not\r\nhelp meeting each other; that is all about it: but people must always\r\nhave something to talk about in Carlingford. I hope you don\'t think I\r\nand Rosa Elsworthy could go together," she went on, turning round to him\r\nwith a smile. "I don\'t think that would be much of a compliment;" and,\r\nsaying this, Lucy went to get her work out of its usual corner, and sat\r\ndown opposite to her father, with a wonderfully composed face. She was\r\nso composed, indeed, that any interested beholder might have been\r\njustified in thinking that the work suffered in consequence, for it\r\nseemed to take nearly all Lucy\'s strength and leisure to keep up that\r\nlook.\r\n\r\n"Oh!" said Mr Wodehouse, "that\'s how it was? Then I wonder why that\r\nconfounded puppy came here so constantly? I don\'t like that sort of\r\nbehaviour. Don\'t you go into the district any more and meet\r\nhim--that\'s all I\'ve got to say."\r\n\r\n"Because of Rosa Elsworthy?" said Lucy, with a little smile, which did\r\nnot flicker naturally, but was apt to get fixed at the corners of her\r\npretty mouth. "That would never do, papa. Mr Wentworth\'s private\r\nconcerns are nothing to us; but, you know, there is a great work going\r\non in the district, and _that_ can\'t be interfered with," said the young\r\nSister of Mercy, looking up at him with a decision which Mr Wodehouse\r\nwas aware he could make no stand against. And when she stopped speaking,\r\nLucy did a little work, which was for the district too. All this time\r\nshe was admitting to herself that she had been much startled by this\r\nnews about Rosa Elsworthy,--much startled. To be sure, it was not like\r\nMr Wentworth, and very likely it would impair his influence; and it was\r\nnatural that any friend taking an interest in him and the district,\r\nshould be taken a little aback by such news. Accordingly, Lucy sat a\r\nlittle more upright than usual, and was conscious that when she smiled,\r\nas she had just done, the smile did not glide off again in a natural\r\nway, but settled down into the lines of her face with a kind of spasmodic\r\ntenacity. She could do a great deal in the way of self-control, but she\r\ncould not quite command these refractory muscles. Mr Wodehouse, who was\r\nnot particularly penetrating, could not quite make her out; he saw there\r\nwas something a little different from her ordinary look about his\r\nfavourite child, but he had not insight enough to enable him to\r\ncomprehend what it was.\r\n\r\n"And about his man who is staying at Mrs Hadwin\'s?" said the perplexed\r\nchurchwarden; "does any one know who the fellow is? I don\'t understand\r\nhow Wentworth has got into all this hot water in a moment. Here\'s the\r\nRector in a state of fury,--and his aunts,--and now here\'s this little\r\nbit of scandal to crown all;--and who is this fellow in his house?"\r\n\r\n"It must be somebody he has taken in out of charity," said Miss\r\nWodehouse, with tears in her eyes; "I am sure it is somebody whom he\r\nhas opened his doors to out of Christian charity and the goodness of\r\nhis heart. I don\'t understand how you can all desert him at the first\r\nword. All the years he has been here, you know there never was a\r\nwhisper against him; and is it in reason to think he would go so far\r\nwrong all in a moment?" cried the faithful advocate of the Perpetual\r\nCurate. Her words were addressed to Mr Wodehouse, but her eyes sought\r\nLucy, who was sitting very upright doing her work, without any leisure\r\nto look round. Lucy had quite enough to occupy her within herself at\r\nthat emergency, and the tearful appeal of her elder sister had no\r\neffect upon her. As for Mr Wodehouse, he was more and more puzzled how\r\nto interpret these tears in his daughter\'s eyes.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t make it out at all," said the perplexed father, getting up to\r\nleave the room. "I hope _you_ weren\'t in love with him, Molly? you\r\nought to have too much sense for that. A pretty mess he\'ll find when\r\nhe comes home; but he must get out of it the best way he can, for _I_\r\ncan\'t help him, at least. I don\'t mean to have him asked here any\r\nmore--you understand, Lucy," he said, turning round at the door, with\r\nan emphatic creak of his boots. But Lucy had no mind to be seduced\r\ninto any such confession of weakness.\r\n\r\n"You are always having everybody in Carlingford to dinner," said the\r\nyoung housekeeper, "and all the clergymen, even _that_ Mr Leeson; and\r\nI don\'t see why you should except Mr Wentworth, papa; he has done\r\nnothing wicked, so far as we know. I daresay he won\'t want to bring\r\nRosa Elsworthy with him; and why shouldn\'t he be asked here?" said\r\nLucy, looking full in his face with her bright eyes. Mr Wodehouse was\r\nentirely discomfited, and did not know what to say. "I wonder if you\r\nknow what you mean yourselves, you women," he muttered; and then, with\r\na shrug of his shoulders, and a hasty "settle it as you please," the\r\nchurchwarden\'s boots creaked hastily out of the room, and out of the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nAfter this a dead silence fell upon the drawing-room and its two\r\noccupants. They did not burst forth into mutual comment upon this last\r\npiece of Carlingford news, as they would have done under any other\r\ncircumstances; on the contrary, they bent over their several occupations\r\nwith quite an unusual devotion, not exchanging so much as a look. Lucy,\r\nover her needlework, was the steadiest of the two; she was still at the\r\nsame point in her thoughts, owning to herself that she was startled, and\r\nindeed shocked, by what she had heard--that it was a great pity for Mr\r\nWentworth; perhaps that it was not quite what might have been expected\r\nof him,--and then she checked herself, and went back again to her\r\noriginal acknowledgment. To tell the truth, though she assured herself\r\nthat she had nothing to do with it, a strange sense of having just\r\npassed through an unexpected illness, lay underneath Lucy\'s composure.\r\nIt was none of her business, to be sure, but she could not help feeling\r\nas if she had just had a fever, or some other sudden unlooked-for\r\nattack, and that nobody knew of it, and that she must get well as best\r\nshe could, without any help from without.\r\n\r\nIt was quite half an hour before Miss Wodehouse got up from the\r\nknitting which she had spoiled utterly, trying to take up the dropped\r\nstitches with her trembling fingers, and dropping others by every\r\neffort she made. The poor lady went wistfully about the room,\r\nwandering from corner to corner, as if in search of something; at last\r\nshe took courage to speak, when she found herself behind her young\r\nsister. "Dear, I am sure it is not true," said Miss Wodehouse,\r\nsuddenly, with a little sob; and then she came close to Lucy\'s chair,\r\nand put her hand timidly upon her sister\'s shoulder. "Think how many\r\ngood things you two have done together, dear; and is it likely you are\r\nto be parted like this?" said the injudicious comforter. It felt\r\nrather like another attack of fever to Lucy, as unexpected as the\r\nlast.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t speak so, please," said the poor girl, with a momentary shiver.\r\n"It is about Mr Wentworth you mean?" she went on, after a little,\r\nwithout turning her head. "I--am sorry, of course. I am afraid it will\r\ndo him--harm," and then she made a pause, and stumbled over her sewing\r\nwith fingers which felt feeble and powerless to the very tips--all on\r\naccount of this fever she had had. "But I don\'t know any reason why\r\nyou and I should discuss it, Mary," she said, getting up in her turn,\r\nnot quite sure whether she could stand at this early period of her\r\nconvalescence, but resolved to try. "We are both Mr Wentworth\'s\r\nfriends--and we need not say any harm of him. I have to get something\r\nout of the storeroom for to-night."\r\n\r\n"But, Lucy," said the tender, trembling sister, who did not know how\r\nto be wise and silent, "_I_ trust him, and _you_ don\'t. Oh, my dear,\r\nit will break my heart. I know some part of it is not true. I know one\r\nthing in which he is quite--quite innocent. Oh, Lucy, my darling, if\r\nyou distrust him it will be returning evil for good!" cried poor Miss\r\nWodehouse, with tears. As for Lucy, she did not quite know what her\r\nsister said. She only felt that it was cruel to stop her, and look at\r\nher, and talk to her; and there woke up in her mind a fierce sudden\r\nspark of resistance to the intolerable.\r\n\r\n"Why do you hold me? I may have been ill, but I can stand well enough\r\nby myself," cried Lucy, to her sister\'s utter bewilderment. "That is,\r\nI--I mean, I have other things to attend to," she cried, breaking into\r\na few hot tears of mortification over this self-betrayal; and so went\r\naway in a strange glow and tremble of sudden passion, such as had\r\nnever been seen before in that quiet house. She went direct to the\r\nstoreroom, as she had said, and got out what was wanted; and only\r\nafter that was done permitted herself to go up to her own room, and\r\nturn the key in her door. Though she was a Sister of Mercy, and much\r\nbeloved in Prickett\'s Lane, she was still but one of Eve\'s poor\r\npetulant women-children, and had it in her to fly at an intruder on\r\nher suffering, like any other wounded creature. But she did not make\r\nany wild demonstration of her pain, even when shut up thus in her\r\nfortress. She sat down on the sofa, in a kind of dull heaviness,\r\nlooking into vacancy. She was not positively thinking of Mr Wentworth,\r\nor of any one thing in particular. She was only conscious of a\r\nterrible difference somehow in everything about her--in the air which\r\nchoked her breathing, and the light which blinded her eyes. When she\r\ncame to herself a little, she said over and over, half-aloud, that\r\neverything was just the same as it had always been, and that to her at\r\nleast nothing had happened; but that declaration, though made with\r\nvehemence, did not alter matters. The world altogether had sustained a\r\nchange. The light that was in it was darkened, and the heart stilled.\r\nAll at once, instead of a sweet spontaneous career, providing for its\r\nown wants day by day, life came to look like something which required\r\nsuch an amount of courage and patience and endurance as Lucy had not\r\nat hand to support her in the way; and her heart failed her at the\r\nmoment when she found this out.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding, the people who dined at Mr Wodehouse\'s that night\r\nthought it a very agreeable little party, and more than once repeated\r\nthe remark, so familiar to most persons in society in Carlingford--that\r\nWodehouse\'s parties were the pleasantest going, though he himself was\r\nhumdrum enough. Two or three of the people present had heard the\r\ngossip about Mr Wentworth, and discussed it, as was natural, taking\r\ndifferent views of the subject; and poor Miss Wodehouse took up his\r\ndefence so warmly, and with such tearful vehemence, that there were\r\nsmiles to be seen on several faces. As for Lucy, she made only a very\r\nsimple remark on the subject. She said: "Mr Wentworth is a great\r\nfriend of ours, and I think I would rather not hear any gossip about\r\nhim." Of course there were one or two keen observers who put a subtle\r\nmeaning to this, and knew what was signified by her looks and her ways\r\nall the evening; but, most likely, they were altogether mistaken in\r\ntheir suppositions, for nobody could possibly watch her so closely as\r\ndid Miss Wodehouse, who know no more than the man in the moon, at the\r\nclose of the evening, whether her young sister was very wretched or\r\ntotally indifferent. The truth was certainly not to be discovered, for\r\nthat night at least, in Lucy\'s looks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next afternoon there were signs of a considerable commotion in Mr\r\nElsworthy\'s shop. Rosa had disappeared altogether, and Mrs Elsworthy,\r\nwith an ominous redness on her cheeks, had taken the place generally\r\nheld by that more agreeable little figure. All the symptoms of having\r\nbeen engaged in an affray from which she had retired not altogether\r\nvictorious were in Mrs Elsworthy\'s face, and the errand-boys vanished\r\nfrom her neighbourhood with inconceivable rapidity, and found out little\r\nparcels to deliver which would have eluded their most anxious search in\r\nother circumstances. Mr Elsworthy himself occupied his usual place in\r\nthe foreground, without the usual marks of universal content and\r\nsatisfaction with all his surroundings which generally distinguished\r\nhim. An indescribable appearance of having been recently snubbed hung\r\nabout the excellent man, and his glances towards the back-shop, and the\r\nglances directed from the back-shop to him, told with sufficient\r\nsignificance the quarter from which his humiliation had proceeded. It\r\nhad done him good, as such painful discipline generally does; for he was\r\nclearing out some drawers in which sundry quires of paper had broken\r\nloose and run into confusion, with the air of a man who ought to have\r\ndone it weeks ago. As for the partner of his bosom, she was standing in\r\nthe obscure distance behind the counter knitting a blue stocking, which\r\nwas evidently intended for no foot but his. There was a chair close by,\r\nbut Mrs Elsworthy disdained to sit down. She stood with her knitting in\r\nconscious power, now and then suffering a confession of her faith to\r\nescape her. "There\'s nothing as don\'t go contrary in this world," said\r\nthe discontented wife, "when a man\'s a fool." It was hard upon Mr\r\nElsworthy that his ears were sharp, and that he knew exactly what this\r\nagreeable murmur was. But he was wise in his generation, and made no\r\nreply.\r\n\r\nThings were in this condition when, of all persons in Carlingford, it\r\noccurred to Miss Leonora Wentworth to enter Mr Elsworthy\'s shop. Not\r\nthat she was alone, or bent upon any errand of inquiry; for Miss\r\nLeonora seldom moved about unattended by her sisters, whom she felt it\r\nher duty to take out for exercise; and wonderfully enough, she had not\r\nfound out yet what was the source of Miss Dora\'s mysteries and\r\ndepression, having been still occupied meantime by her own "great\r\nwork" in her London district, and the affair of the gin-palace, which\r\nwas still undecided. She had been talking a great deal about this\r\ngin-palace for the last twenty-four hours; and to hear Miss Leonora,\r\nyou might have supposed that all the powers of heaven must fail and be\r\ndiscomfited before this potent instrument of evil, and that, after\r\nall, Bibles and missionaries were much less effective than the\r\nstoppage of the licence, upon which all her agents were bent. At all\r\nevents, such an object of interest had swept out from her thoughts the\r\nvague figure of her nephew Frank, and aunt Dora\'s mysterious anxieties\r\non his account. When the three ladies approached Elsworthy\'s, the\r\nfirst thing that attracted their attention was Rosa, the little Rosa\r\nwho had been banished from the shop, and whom Mrs Elsworthy believed\r\nto be expiating her sins in a back room, in tears and darkness;\r\ninstead of which the little girl was looking out of her favourite\r\nwindow, and amusing herself much with all that was going on in Grange\r\nLane. Though she was fluttered by the scolding she had received, Rosa\r\nonly looked prettier than usual with her flushed cheeks; and so many\r\nthings had been put into her nonsensical little head during the last\r\ntwo days, especially by her aunt\'s denunciations, that her sense of\r\nself-importance was very much heightened in consequence. She looked at\r\nthe Miss Wentworths with a throb of mingled pride and alarm, wondering\r\nwhether perhaps she might know more of them some day, if Mr Wentworth\r\nwas really fond of her, as people said--which thought gave Rosa a\r\nwonderful sensation of awe and delighted vanity. Meanwhile the three\r\nMiss Wentworths looked at her with very diverse feelings. "I must\r\nspeak to these people about that little girl, if nobody else has sense\r\nenough to do it," said Miss Leonora; "she is evidently going wrong as\r\nfast as she can, the little fool;" and the iron-grey sister went into\r\nMr Elsworthy\'s in this perfectly composed and ordinary frame of mind,\r\nwith her head full of the application which was to be made to the\r\nlicensing magistrates today, in the parish of St Michael, and totally\r\nunaware that anybody belonging to herself could ever be connected with\r\nthe incautious little coquette at the window. Miss Dora\'s feelings\r\nwere very different. It was much against her will that she was going\r\nat all into this obnoxious shop, and the eyes which she hastily\r\nuplifted to the window and withdrew again with lively disgust and\r\ndislike, were both angry and tearful; "Little forward shameless\r\nthing," Miss Dora said to herself, with a little toss of her head. As\r\nfor Miss Wentworth, it was not her custom to say anything--but she,\r\ntoo, looked up, and saw the pretty face at the window, and secretly\r\nconcluded that it might all be quite true, and that she had known a\r\nyoung man make a fool of himself before now for such another. So they\r\nall went in, unwitting that they came at the end of a domestic\r\nhurricane, and that the waters were still in a state of disturbance.\r\nMiss Wentworth took the only chair, as was natural, and sat down\r\nsweetly to wait for Leonora, and Miss Dora lingered behind while her\r\nsister made her purchases. Miss Leonora wanted some books--\r\n\r\n"And I came here," she said, with engaging candour, "because I see no\r\nother shop in this part of the town except Masters\'s, which, of\r\ncourse, I would not enter. It is easy enough to do without books, but\r\nI can\'t afford to compromise my principles, Mr Elsworthy;" to which Mr\r\nElsworthy had replied, "No, ma\'am, of course not--such a thing aint to\r\nbe expected;" with one eye upon his customer, and one upon his\r\nbelligerent wife.\r\n\r\n"And, by the by, if you will permit me to speak about what does not\r\nconcern me," said Miss Leonora cheerfully, "I think you should look\r\nafter that little girl of yours more carefully;--recollect I don\'t\r\nmean any offence; but she\'s very pretty, you know, and very young, and\r\nvain, as a matter of course. I saw her the other evening going down\r\nGrange Lane, a great deal too late for such a creature to be out; and\r\nthough I don\'t doubt, you are very particular where she goes--"\r\n\r\nIt was at this conjuncture that Mrs Elsworthy, who could not keep\r\nsilence any longer, broke in ardently, with all her knitting-needles\r\nin front of her, disposed like a kind of porcupine mail--\r\n\r\n"I\'m well known in Carlingford--better known than most," said Mrs\r\nElsworthy, with a sob; "such a thing as not being particular was never\r\nnamed to me. I strive and I toil from morning to night, as all things\r\nshould be respectable and kep\' in good order; but what\'s the good?\r\nHere\'s my heart broken, that\'s all; and Elsworthy standing gaping like\r\na gaby as he is. There aint nothing as don\'t go contrairy, when folks\r\nis tied to a set of fools!" cried the indignant matron. "As for\r\npretty, I don\'t know nothing about it; I\'ve got too much to do minding\r\nmy own business. Them as has nothing to think of but stand in the shop\r\nand twiddle their thumbs, ought to look to that; but, ma\'am, if you\'ll\r\nbelieve me, it aint no fault of mine. It aint my will to throw her in\r\nany young gentleman\'s way; not to say a clergyman as we\'re bound to\r\nrespect. Whatever you does, ladies,--and I shouldn\'t wonder at your\r\ntaking away your custom, nor nothing else as was a punishment--don\'t\r\nblame me!"\r\n\r\n"But you forget, Mrs Elsworthy, that we have nothing to do with\r\nit,--nothing at all; my nephew knows very well what he is about," said\r\nMiss Dora, in injudicious haste. "Mr Wentworth is not at all likely to\r\nforget himself," continued that poor lady, getting confused as her\r\nsister turned round and stared at her. "Of course it was all out of\r\nkindness;--I--I know Frank did not mean anything," cried the\r\nunfortunate aunt. Leonora\'s look, as she turned round and fixed her\r\neyes upon her, took away what little breath Miss Dora had.\r\n\r\n"Mr Wentworth?" asked Miss Leonora; "I should be glad to know, if\r\nanybody would inform me, what Mr Wentworth can possibly have to do\r\nwith it? I daresay you misunderstood me; I said you were to look after\r\nthat little girl--your niece, or whatever she is; I did not say\r\nanything about Mr Wentworth," said the strong-minded sister, looking\r\nround upon them all. For the moment she forgot all about the licence,\r\nand turned upon Mr Elsworthy with an emphasis which almost drive that\r\ntroubled citizen to his knees.\r\n\r\n"That was how I understood it," said the clerk of St Roque\'s, humbly;\r\n"there wasn\'t nothing said about Mr Wentworth--nor there couldn\'t be\r\nas I know of, but what was in his favour, for there aint many young\r\nmen like our clergyman left in the Church. It aint because I\'m\r\nspeaking to respected ladies as is his relations; folks may talk,"\r\nsaid Mr Elsworthy, with a slight faltering, "but I never see his\r\nequal; and as for an act of kindness to an orphan child--"\r\n\r\n"The orphan child is neither here nor there," said his angry wife, who\r\nhad taken up her post by his side; "a dozen fathers and mothers\r\ncouldn\'t have done better by her than we\'ve done; and to go and lay\r\nout her snares for them as is so far above her, if you\'ll believe me,\r\nma\'am, it\'s nigh broken my heart. She\'s neither flesh nor blood o\'\r\nmine," cried the aggrieved woman; "there would have been a different\r\ntale to tell if she had belonged to me. I\'d have--murdered her, ma\'am,\r\nthough it aint proper to say so, afore we\'d have gone and raised a\r\ntalk like this; it aint my blame, if it was my dying word," cried Mrs\r\nElsworthy, relapsing into angry tears: "I\'m one as has always shown\r\nher a good example, and never gone flirting about, nor cast my eyes to\r\none side or another for the best man as ever walked; and to think as a\r\nrespectable family should be brought to shame through her doings, and\r\na gentleman as is a clergyman got himself talked about--it\'s gone nigh\r\nto kill me, that\'s what it\'s done," sobbed the virtuous matron; "and I\r\ndon\'t see as nobody cares."\r\n\r\nMiss Leonora had been woke up suddenly out of her abstract\r\noccupations; she penetrated to the heart of the matter while all this\r\ntalk was going on. She transfixed her sister Dora, who seemed much\r\ninclined to cry like Mrs Elsworthy, with a look which overwhelmed that\r\ntrembling woman; then she addressed herself with great suavity to the\r\nmatter in hand.\r\n\r\n"I suppose it is this poor little foolish child who has been getting\r\nherself talked about?" said Miss Leonora. "It\'s a pity, to be sure,\r\nbut I daresay it\'s not so bad as you think. As for her laying snares\r\nfor people above her, I wouldn\'t be afraid of that. Poor little thing!\r\nIt\'s not so easy as you think laying snares. Perhaps it\'s the new\r\nminister at Salem Chapel who has been paying attention to her? I would\r\nnot take any notice of it if I were you. Don\'t let her loll about at\r\nthe window as she\'s doing, and don\'t let her go out so late, and give\r\nher plenty of work to do. My maid wants some one to help in her\r\nneedlework. Perhaps this child would do, Cecilia?" said Miss Leonora.\r\n"As for her snares, poor thing, I don\'t feel much afraid of them. I\r\ndaresay if Mr Wentworth had Sunday classes for the young people as I\r\nwished him to have, and took pains to give them proper instruction,\r\nsuch things would not happen. If you send her to my maid, I flatter\r\nmyself she will soon come to her senses. Good morning; and you will\r\nplease to send me the books--there are some others I want you to get\r\nfor me next week," said Mr Elsworthy\'s patroness. "I will follow you,\r\nDora, please," and Miss Leonora swept her sisters out before her, and\r\nwent upon her way with indescribable grandeur. Even little Rosa felt\r\nthe change, where she sat at the window looking out. The little vain\r\ncreature no longer felt it possible to believe, as she looked after\r\nthem, that she ever could be anything to the Miss Wentworths except a\r\nlittle girl in a shop. It shook her confidence in what people said;\r\nand it was as well for her that she withdrew from the window at that\r\nconjuncture, and so had an opportunity of hearing her aunt come\r\nup-stairs, and of darting back again to the penitential darkness of\r\nher own chamber at the back of the house--which saved Rosa some angry\r\nwords at least.\r\n\r\nAs for Miss Leonora Wentworth, she said nothing to her sisters on this\r\nnew subject. She saw them safely home to their own apartments, and\r\nwent out again without explaining her movements. When she was gone,\r\nMiss Wentworth listened to Miss Dora\'s doubts and tears with her\r\nusual patience, but did not go into the matter much. "It doesn\'t\r\nmatter whether it is your fault or not," said aunt Cecilia, with a\r\nlarger amount of words than usual, and a sharpness very uncommon with\r\nher; "but I daresay Leonora will set it all right." After all, the\r\nconfidence which the elder sister had in Leonora was justified. She\r\ndid not entirely agree with her about the "great work," nor was\r\ndisposed to connect the non-licensing of the gin-palace in any way\r\nwith the faithfulness of God: but she comprehended in her gentle heart\r\nthat there were other matters of which Leonora was capable. As for\r\nMiss Dora, she went to the summer-house at last, and, seating herself\r\nat the window, cried under her breath till she had a very bad\r\nheadache, and was of no use for any purpose under heaven. She thought\r\nnothing less than that Leonora had gone abroad to denounce poor Frank,\r\nand tell everybody how wicked he was; and she was so sure her poor\r\ndear boy did not mean anything! She sat with her head growing heavier\r\nand heavier, watching for her sister\'s return, and calculating within\r\nherself how many places Leonora must have called at, and how utterly\r\ngone by this time must be the character of the Perpetual Curate. At\r\nlast, in utter despair, with her thin curls all limp about her poor\r\ncheeks, Miss Dora had to go to bed and have the room darkened, and\r\nswallow cups of green tea and other nauseous compounds, at the will\r\nand pleasure of her maid, who was learned in headache. The poor lady\r\nsobbed herself to sleep after a time, and saw, in a hideous dream, her\r\nsister Leonora marching from house to house of poor Frank\'s friends,\r\nand closing door after door with all sorts of clang and dash upon the\r\nreturning prodigal. "But oh, it was not my fault--oh, my dear, she\r\nfound it out herself. You do not think _I_ was to blame?" sobbed poor\r\naunt Dora in her troubled slumber; and her headache did not get any\r\nbetter notwithstanding the green tea.\r\n\r\nMiss Dora\'s visions were partly realised, for it was quite true that\r\nher iron-grey sister was making a round of calls upon Frank\'s friends.\r\nMiss Leonora Wentworth went out in great state that day. She had her\r\nhandsomest dress on, and the bonnet which her maid had calculated upon\r\nas her own property, because it was much too nice for Miss Leonora. In\r\nthis impossible attire she went to see Mrs Hadwin, and was very gracious\r\nto that unsuspecting woman, and learned a few things of which she had\r\nnot the least conception previously. Then she went to the Miss\r\nWodehouses, and made the elder sister there mighty uncomfortable by her\r\nkeen looks and questions; and what Miss Leonora did after that was not\r\ndistinctly known to any one. She got into Prickett\'s Lane somehow, and\r\nstumbled upon No. 10, much to the surprise of the inhabitants; and\r\nbefore she returned home she had given Mrs Morgan her advice about the\r\nVirginian creeper which was intended to conceal the continual passage of\r\nthe railway trains. "But I would not trust to trellis-work. I would\r\nbuild up the wall a few feet higher, and then you will have some\r\nsatisfaction in your work," said Miss Leonora, and left the Rector\'s\r\nwife to consider the matter in rather an agreeable state of mind, for\r\nthat had been Mrs Morgan\'s opinion all along. After this last visit the\r\nactive aunt returned home, going leisurely along George Street, and down\r\nGrange Lane, with meditative steps. Miss Leonora, of course, would not\r\nfor kingdoms have confessed that any new light had come into her mind,\r\nor that some very ordinary people in Carlingford, no one of whom she\r\ncould have confidently affirmed to be a converted person, had left a\r\ncertain vivid and novel impression upon her thoughts. She went along\r\nmuch more slowly than usual in this new mood of reflectiveness. She was\r\nnot thinking of the licensing magistrates of St Michael\'s nor the\r\nbeautiful faith of the colporteur. Other ideas filled her mind at the\r\nmoment. Whether perhaps, after all, a man who did his duty by rich and\r\npoor, and could encounter all things for love and duty\'s sake, was not\r\nabout the best man for a parish priest, even though he did have\r\nchoristers in white surplices, and lilies on the Easter altar? Whether\r\nit might not be a comfort to know that in the pretty parsonage at\r\nSkelmersdale there was some one ready to start at a moment\'s notice for\r\nthe help of a friend or the succour of a soul--brother to Charley who\r\nwon the Cross for valour, and not unworthy of the race? Some strange\r\nmoisture came into the corners of Miss Leonora\'s eyes. There was Gerald\r\ntoo, whom the Perpetual Curate had declared to be the best man he ever\r\nknew; and the Evangelical woman, with all her prejudices, could not in\r\nher heart deny it. Various other thoughts of a similar description, but\r\ntoo shadowy to bear expression, came in spite of herself through Miss\r\nLeonora\'s mind. "We know that God heareth not sinners; but if any man be\r\na worshipper of God and doeth His will, him He heareth;" and it occurred\r\nto her vaguely, for the first time, that she was harder to please than\r\nher Master. Not that such an idea could get possession of a mind so well\r\nfortified, at the first assault; but it was strange how often the\r\nthought came back to her that the man who had thrilled through all those\r\npeople about Prickett\'s Lane a kind of vague sense that they were\r\nChristians, and not hopeless wretches, forgotten of God; and who had\r\ntaken in the mysterious lodger at Mrs Hadwin\'s, bearing the penalty of\r\nsuspicion without complaint, would be true at his post wherever he might\r\nbe, and was a priest of God\'s appointing. Such were the strangely novel\r\nideas which went flashing through Miss Leonora\'s mind as she went home\r\nto dinner, ejecting summarily the new gin-palaces and her favourite\r\ncolporteur. If anybody had stated them in words, she would have\r\nindignantly scouted such latitudinarian stuff; but they kept flickering\r\nin the strangest fluctuations, coming and going, bringing in native\r\nWentworth prejudices and natural affections to overcome all other\r\nprepossessions, in the most inveterate, unexplainable way. For it will\r\nbe apparent that Miss Leonora, being a woman of sense, utterly scorned\r\nthe Rosa Elsworthy hypothesis, and comprehended as nearly how it\r\nhappened as it was possible for any one unaware of the facts to do.\r\n\r\nSuch were the good and bad angels who fought over the Curate\'s fate\r\nwhile he was away. He might have been anxious if he had known anything\r\nabout them, or had been capable of imagining any such clouds as those\r\nwhich overshadowed his good name in the lively imagination of\r\nCarlingford. But Rosa Elsworthy never could have occurred to the\r\nunconscious young man as a special danger, any more than the relenting\r\nin the heart of his aunt Leonora could have dawned upon him as a\r\npossible happiness. To tell the truth, he had left home, so far as he\r\nhimself was concerned, in rather a happy state of mind than otherwise,\r\nwith healthful impulses of opposition to the Rector, and confidence in\r\nthe sympathy of Lucy. To hear that Lucy had given him up, and that\r\nMiss Leonora and Mrs Morgan were the only people who believed in him,\r\nwould have gone pretty far at this moment to make an end of the\r\nPerpetual Curate. But fortunately he knew nothing about it; and while\r\nLucy held her head high with pain, and walked over the burning coals a\r\nconscious martyr, and Miss Dora sobbed herself asleep in her darkened\r\nroom, all on his account, there was plenty of trouble, perplexity, and\r\ndistress in Wentworth Rectory to occupy to the full all the thoughts\r\nand powers of the Curate of St Roque\'s.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was mid-day, and more than twelve hours after he had left Carlingford,\r\nbefore Mr Wentworth reached the Rectory. He had snatched a few hours\'\r\nsleep in London, where he was obliged to pause because of the trains,\r\nwhich did not correspond; and accordingly, though he was very anxious\r\nabout Gerald, it was with a mien and gait very much like his usual\r\nappearance that he jumped out of the railway carriage at the little\r\nstation which was on his father\'s property, and where everybody knew the\r\nSquire\'s son. Left in entire uncertainty as he was in respect to the\r\ntrouble which had overtaken his brother, it was a little comfort to the\r\nCurate to find that everybody looked surprised to see him, and that\r\nnobody seemed to know of any cause demanding his presence. All was well\r\nat the Hall, so far as the station-master knew; and as for the Rector,\r\nhe had no special place in the local report which the handiest porter\r\nsupplied "Mr Frank"--a blessed neglect, which was very consolatory to\r\nthe heart of the anxious brother, to whom it became evident that nothing\r\nhad happened, and who began to hope that Gerald\'s wife, who never was\r\nvery wise, had been seized with some merely fantastic terror. With this\r\nhope he walked on briskly upon the familiar road to his brother\'s house,\r\nrecovering his courage, and falling back upon his own thoughts, and at\r\nlast taking pleasure in the idea of telling all his troubles to Gerald,\r\nand getting strength and enlightenment from his advice. He had come\r\nquite into this view of the subject when he arrived at the Rectory, and\r\nsaw the pretty old-fashioned house, with its high ivied garden-walls,\r\nand the famous cedar on the lawn, standing all secure and sweet in the\r\nearly sunshine, like something too steadfast to be moved, as if sorrow\r\nor conflict could never enter there. Unconsciously to himself, the\r\nperfect tranquillity of everything altered the entire scope of Frank\r\nWentworth\'s thoughts. He was no longer in anxiety about his brother. He\r\nwas going to ask Gerald\'s advice upon his own troubles, and lay the\r\ndifficulties and dangers of his position before the clear and lucid eyes\r\nof the best man he ever knew.\r\n\r\nIt shook him a little out of his position, however, to find himself\r\nadmitted with a kind of scared expectation by Mrs Gerald Wentworth\'s\r\nmaid, who made no exclamation of wonder at the sight of him, but\r\nopened the door in a troubled, stealthy way, strangely unlike the\r\nusual customs of the place. "Is my brother at home?" said the Curate,\r\ngoing in with a step that rang on the hall, and a voice that sounded\r\ninto the house. He would have proceeded straight, as usual, to\r\nGerald\'s study after this question, which was one of form merely, but\r\nfor the disturbed looks of the woman, who put up her hand imploringly.\r\n"Oh hush! Mr Frank; hush! My mistress wants to see you first. She\r\nsaid I was to show you into her sitting-room," said the maid, half\r\nin a whisper, and led him hastily down a side-passage to a little\r\nout-of-the-way room, which he knew was where Louisa was wont to retire\r\nwhen she had her headaches, as was well known to all the house of\r\nWentworth. The Curate went in with some impatience and some alarm to\r\nthis retired apartment. His eyes, dazzled by the sunshine, could not\r\npenetrate at first the shadowy greenness of the room, which, what with\r\nthe trees without and the Venetian blind within, was lost in a kind of\r\ntwilight, grateful enough after a while, but bewildering at the first\r\nmoment. Out of this darkness somebody rose as he entered, and walked\r\ninto his arms with trembling eagerness. "Oh Frank, I am so thankful\r\nyou are come! now perhaps something may be done; for _you_ always\r\nunderstood," said his little sister-in-law, reaching up to kiss him.\r\nShe was a tiny little woman, with soft eyes and a tender little\r\nblooming face, which he had never before seen obscured by any cloud,\r\nor indeed moved by any particular sentiment. Now the firmament was all\r\novercast, and Louisa, it was evident, had been sitting in the shade of\r\nher drawn blinds, having a quiet cry, and going into all her grievances.\r\nTo see such a serene creature all clouded over and full of tears, gave\r\nthe Curate a distinct shock of alarm and anxiety. He led her back to her\r\nsofa, seeing clearer and clearer, as he watched her face, the plaintive\r\nlines of complaint, the heavy burden of trouble which she was about to\r\ncast on his shoulders. He grew more and more afraid as he looked at her.\r\n"Is Gerald ill?" he said, with a thrill of terror; but even this could\r\nscarcely account for the woeful look of all the accessories to the\r\npicture.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Frank, I am so glad you are come!" said Louisa through her tears.\r\n"I felt sure you would come when you got my letter. Your father thinks\r\nI make a fuss about nothing, and Cuthbert and Guy do nothing but laugh\r\nat me, as if they could possibly know; but you always understand me,\r\nFrank. I knew it was just as good as sending for a brother of my own;\r\nindeed better," said Mrs Wentworth, wiping her eyes; "for though\r\nGerald is using me so badly, I would not expose him out of his own\r\nfamily, or have people making remarks--oh, not for the world!"\r\n\r\n"Expose him!" said the Curate, with unutterable astonishment. "You\r\ndon\'t mean to say you have any complaint to make about Gerald?" The\r\nidea was so preposterous that Frank Wentworth laughed; but it was not\r\na laugh pleasant to hear.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Frank, if you but knew all," said Louisa; "what I have had to put\r\nup with for months--all my best feelings outraged, and so many things\r\nto endure that were dreadful to think of. And I that was always\r\nbrought up so differently; but now," cried the poor little woman,\r\nbursting into renewed tears, "it\'s come to such a pass that it can\'t\r\nbe concealed any longer. I think it will break my heart; people will\r\nbe sure to say I have been to blame; and how I am ever to hold up my\r\nhead in society, and what is to be my name, and whether I am to be\r\nconsidered a widow--"\r\n\r\n"A widow!" cried the Perpetual Curate, in utter consternation.\r\n\r\n"Or worse," sobbed Gerald\'s poor little wife: "it feels like being\r\ndivorced--as if one had done something wrong; and I am sure I never\r\ndid anything to deserve it; but when your husband is a Romish priest,"\r\ncried the afflicted woman, pressing her handkerchief to her eyes, "I\r\nwould just ask anybody what are you? You can\'t be his wife, because he\r\nis not allowed to have any wife; and you can\'t go back to your maiden\r\nname, because of the children; and how can you have any place in\r\nsociety? Oh, Frank, I think I shall go distracted," said poor Louisa;\r\n"it will feel as if one had done something wicked, and been put out of\r\nthe pale. How can I be called Mrs Wentworth any more when my husband\r\nhas left me? and even if he is a priest, and can\'t have any wife,\r\nstill he will be alive, and I shall not have the satisfaction of being\r\na widow even. I am sure I don\'t know what I say," she concluded, with\r\na fresh outburst; "for to be a widow would be a poor satisfaction, and\r\nI don\'t know how I could ever, ever live without Gerald; but to feel\r\nas if you were an improper person, and all the children\'s prospects in\r\nlife!--Oh, Frank!" cried the weeping Louisa, burying her face in her\r\nhandkerchief, "I think I shall go distracted, and my heart will\r\nbreak."\r\n\r\nTo all this strange and unexpected revelation the startled Curate\r\nlistened like a man in a dream. Possibly his sister-in-law\'s\r\nrepresentation of this danger, as seen entirely from her own point of\r\nview, had a more alarming effect upon him that any other statement of\r\nthe case. He could have gone into Gerald\'s difficulties with so much\r\nsympathy and fellow-feeling that the shock would have been trifling in\r\ncomparison; and between Rome and the highest level of Anglicanism\r\nthere was no such difference as to frighten the accustomed mind of the\r\nCurate of St Roque\'s. But, seen from Louisa\'s side, matters appeared\r\nvery different: here the foundations of the earth were shaking, and\r\nlife itself going to pieces; even the absurdity of her distress made\r\nthe whole business more real; and the poor little woman, whose trouble\r\nwas that she herself would neither be a wife nor a widow, had enough\r\nof truth on her side to unfold a miserable picture to the eyes of the\r\nanxious spectator. He did not know what answer to make her; and\r\nperhaps it was a greater consolation to poor Louisa to be permitted to\r\nrun on--\r\n\r\n"And you know it never needed to have come to this if Gerald had been\r\nlike other people," she said, drying her tears, and with a tone of\r\nremonstrance. "Of course it is a family living, and it is not likely\r\nhis own father would have made any disturbance; and there is no other\r\nfamily in the parish but the Skipwiths, and they are great friends,\r\nand never would have said a word. He might have preached in six\r\nsurplices if he had liked," cried poor Louisa--"who would have minded?\r\nAnd as for confession, and all that, I don\'t believe there is anybody\r\nin the world who had done any wrong that could have helped confessing\r\nto Gerald; he is so good--oh, Frank, you know he is so good!" said the\r\nexasperated little wife, overcome with fondness and admiration and\r\nimpatience, "and there is nobody in the parish that I ever heard of\r\nthat does not worship him; but when I tell him so, he never pays the\r\nleast attention. And then Edward Plumstead and he go on talking about\r\nsubscription, and signing articles, and nonsense, till they make my\r\nhead swim. Nobody, I am sure, wants Gerald to subscribe or sign\r\narticles. I am sure I would subscribe any amount," cried the poor\r\nlittle woman, once more falling into tears--"a thousand pounds if I\r\nhad it, Frank--only to make him hear reason; for why should he leave\r\nWentworth, where he can do what he likes, and nobody will interfere\r\nwith him? The Bishop is an old friend of my father\'s, and I am sure\r\nhe never would say anything; and as for candles and crosses\r\nand--anything he pleases, Frank--"\r\n\r\nHere poor Louisa paused, and put her hand on his arm, and looked up\r\nwistfully into his face. She wanted to convince herself that she was\r\nright, and that the faltering dread she had behind all this, of\r\nsomething more mysterious than candles or crosses--something which she\r\ndid not attempt to understand--was no real spectre after all. "Oh,\r\nFrank, I am sure I never would oppose him, nor your father, nor\r\nanybody; and why should he go and take some dreadful step, and upset\r\neverything?" said Mrs Wentworth. "Oh, Frank! we will not even have\r\nenough to live upon; and as for me, if Gerald leaves me, how shall I\r\never hold up my head again, or how will anybody know how to behave to\r\nme? I can\'t call myself Miss Leighton again, after being married so\r\nlong; and if I am not his wife, what shall I be?" Her crying became\r\nhysterical as she came back to this point; and Mr Wentworth sat by her\r\ntrying to soothe her, as wretched as herself.\r\n\r\n"But I must see Gerald, Louisa," said the Curate; "he has never\r\nwritten to me about this. Perhaps things have not gone so far as you\r\nthink; but as for the crosses and the candles, you know, and not being\r\ninterfered with--"\r\n\r\n"I would promise to do anything he likes," cried the weeping woman. "I\r\nnever would worry him any more about anything. After aunt Leonora was\r\nhere, perhaps I said things I should not have said; but, oh Frank,\r\nwhatever he likes to do I am sure I will give in to it. I don\'t\r\n_really_ mind seeing him preach in his surplice, only you know poor\r\npapa was so _very_ Low-Church; and as for the candles, what are they\r\nto pleasing one\'s husband? Oh, Frank, if you would only tell him--I\r\ncan\'t argue about things like a man--tell him nobody will ever\r\ninterfere, and he shall do whatever he pleases. I trust to you to say\r\n_everything_," said the poor wife. "You can reason with him and\r\nexplain things. Nobody understands Gerald like you. You will not\r\nforsake me in my trouble, Frank? I thought immediately of you. I knew\r\nyou could help us, if anybody could. You will tell him all I have\r\nsaid," she continued, rising as Mr Wentworth rose, and going after him\r\nto the door, to impress once more upon him the necessities of the\r\ncase. "Oh, Frank, remember how much depends upon it!--everything in\r\nthe world for me, and all the children\'s prospects in life; and he\r\nwould be miserable himself if he were to leave us. You know he would?"\r\nsaid Louisa, looking anxiously into his face, and putting her hand on\r\nhis arm. "Oh, Frank, you don\'t think Gerald could be happy without the\r\nchildren--and me?"\r\n\r\nThe terrible thought silenced her. She stopped crying, and a kind of\r\ntearless horror and dread came over her face. She was not very wise,\r\nbut her heart was tender and full of love in its way. What if perhaps\r\nthis life, which had gone so smoothly over her unthinking head without\r\nany complications, should turn out to be a lie, and her happiness a\r\nmere delusion? She could not have put her thoughts into words, but the\r\ndoubt suddenly came over her, putting a stop to all her lamentations.\r\nIf perhaps Gerald _could_ be happy without the children and herself,\r\nwhat dreadful fiction had all her joy been built upon! Such an\r\ninarticulate terror seemed to stop the very beating of her heart. It\r\nwas not a great calamity only but an overthrowal of all confidence in\r\nlife; and she shivered before it like a dumb creature piteously\r\nbeholding an approaching agony which it could not comprehend. The\r\nutterance of her distress was arrested upon her lips,--she looked up\r\nto her brother with an entreating look, so suddenly intensified and\r\ngrown desperate that he was startled by it. It alarmed him so much\r\nthat he turned again to lead her back to her sofa, wondering what\r\nmomentary passion it could be which had woke such a sudden world of\r\nconfused meaning in Louisa\'s eyes.\r\n\r\n"You may be sure he could not," said the Curate, warmly. "Not happy,\r\ncertainly; but to men like Gerald there are things in the world\r\ndearer than happiness," he said, after a little pause, with a sigh,\r\nwondering to himself whether, if Lucy Wodehouse were his, his dearest\r\nduty could make him consent to part with her. "If he thinks of such a\r\nstep, he must think of it as of martyrdom--is that a comfort to you?"\r\nhe continued, bending, in his pity and wonder, over the trembling\r\nwife, who burst forth into fresh tears as he spoke, and forgot her\r\nmomentary horror.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Frank, go and speak to him, and tell him how miserable I am, and\r\nwhat a dreadful thing it would be; tell him everything, Frank. Oh, don\'t\r\nleave him till you have persuaded him. Go, go; never mind me," cried Mrs\r\nWentworth; and then she went to the door after him once more--"Don\'t say\r\nI sent for you. He--he might not be pleased," she said, in her\r\nfaltering, eager voice; "and oh, Frank, consider how much hangs upon\r\nwhat you say." When he left her, Louisa stood at the door watching him\r\nas he went along the passage towards her husband\'s room. It was a\r\nforlorn-hope; but still the unreasoning, uncomprehending heart took a\r\nlittle comfort from it. She watched his figure disappearing along the\r\nnarrow passage with a thrill of mingled anxiety and hope; arguing with\r\nGerald, though it was so ineffectual when she tried it, might still be\r\nof some avail in stronger hands. His brother understood him, and could\r\ntalk to him better than anybody else could; and though she had never\r\nconvinced anybody of anything all her life, Mrs Wentworth had an\r\ninalienable confidence in the effect of "being talked to." In the\r\nmomentary stimulus she went back to her darkened room and drew up the\r\nblind, and went to work in a tremulous way; but as the slow time went\r\non, and Frank did not return, poor Louisa\'s courage failed her; her\r\nfingers refused their office, and she began to imagine all sorts of\r\nthings that might be going on in Gerald\'s study. Perhaps the argument\r\nmight be going the wrong way; perhaps Gerald might be angry at his\r\nbrother\'s interference; perhaps they might come to words--they who had\r\nbeen such good friends--and it would be her fault. She jumped up with\r\nher heart beating loud when she heard a door opened somewhere; but when\r\nnobody came, grew sick and faint, and hid her face, in the impatience of\r\nher misery. Then the feeling grew upon her that those precious moments\r\nwere decisive, and that she must make one last appeal, or her heart\r\nwould burst. She tried to resist the impulse in a feeble way, but it was\r\nnot her custom to resist impulses, and it got the better of her; and\r\nthis was why poor Louisa rushed into the library, just as Frank thought\r\nhe had made a little advance in his pleading, and scattered his\r\neloquence to the winds with a set of dreadful arguments which were all\r\nher own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Curate of St Roque\'s found his brother in his library, looking\r\nvery much as he always looked at first glance. But Gerald was not\r\nreading nor writing nor doing anything. He was seated in his usual\r\nchair, by his usual table, with all the ordinary things around. Some\r\nmanuscript--lying loosely about, and looking as if he had thrown down\r\nhis pen in disgust, and pushed it away from him in the middle of a\r\nsentence--was on the table, and an open book in his other hand; but\r\nneither the book nor the manuscript occupied him; he was sitting\r\nleaning his head in his hands, gazing blankly out through the window,\r\nas it appeared, at the cedar, which flung its serene shadow over the\r\nlawn outside. He jumped up at the sound of his brother\'s voice, but\r\nseemed to recall himself with a little difficulty even for that, and\r\ndid not look much surprised to see him. In short, Frank read in\r\nGerald\'s eyes that he would not at that moment have been surprised to\r\nsee any one, and that, in his own consciousness, the emergency was\r\ngreat enough to justify any unlooked-for appearance, though it might\r\nbe from heaven or from the grave.\r\n\r\n"I am glad you have come," he said, after they had greeted each other,\r\nhis mouth relaxing ever so slightly into the ghost of his old smile;\r\n"you and I always understood each other, and it appears I want\r\ninterpretation now. And one interpretation supposes many," he said\r\nwith a gleam, half of pathos half of amusement, lighting up his face\r\nfor a moment; "there is no such thing as accepting a simple version\r\neven of one man\'s thoughts. You have come at a very fit time,\r\nFrank--that is, for me."\r\n\r\n"I am glad you think so," said the other brother; and then there was a\r\npause, neither liking to enter upon the grand subject which stood\r\nbetween them.\r\n\r\n"Have you seen Louisa?" said Gerald. He spoke like a man who was ill,\r\nin a preoccupied interrupted way. Like a sick man, he was occupied\r\nwith himself, with the train of thought which was always going on in\r\nhis mind whatever he might be doing, whether he was working or\r\nresting, alone or in company. For months back he had carried it with\r\nhim everywhere. The cedar-tree outside, upon which his thoughtful eyes\r\nfell as he looked straight before him out of the library window, was\r\nall garlanded with the reasonings and questionings of this painful\r\nspring. To Frank\'s eyes, Gerald\'s attention was fixed upon the\r\nfluttering of a certain twig at the extremity of one of those broad\r\nsolemn immovable branches. Gerald, however, saw not the twig, but one\r\nof his hardest difficulties which was twined and twined in the most\r\ninextricable way round that little sombre cluster of spikes; and so\r\nkept looking out, not at the cedar, but at the whole confused yet\r\ndistinct array of his own troubled thoughts.\r\n\r\n"If you have seen Louisa, she has been talking to you, no doubt," he\r\nsaid, after another little pause, with again the glimmer of a smile. "We\r\nhave fallen upon troubles, and we don\'t understand each other, Frank.\r\nThat\'s all very natural; she does not see things from my point of view:\r\nI could not expect she should. If I could see from hers, it might be\r\neasier for us all; but that is still less to be expected; and it is hard\r\nupon her, Frank--very hard," said Gerald, turning round in his old\r\ningenuous way, with that faculty for seeing other people\'s difficulties\r\nwhich was so strong a point in his character. "She is called upon to\r\nmake, after all, perhaps, the greater sacrifice of the two; and she does\r\nnot see any duty in it--the reverse, indeed. She thinks it a sin. It is\r\na strange view of life, to look at it from Louisa\'s point. Here will be\r\nan unwilling, unintentional martyrdom; and it is hard to think I should\r\ntake all the merit, and leave my poor little wife the suffering without\r\nany compensation!" He began to walk up and down the room with uneasy\r\nsteps, as if the thought was painful, and had to be got rid of by some\r\nsudden movement. "It must be that God reckons with women for what they\r\nhave endured, as with men for what they have done," said Gerald. He\r\nspoke with a kind of grieved certainty, which made his brother feel, to\r\nstart with, the hopelessness of all argument.\r\n\r\n"But must this be? Is it necessary to take such a final, such a\r\nterrible step?" said the Perpetual Curate.\r\n\r\n"I think so." Gerald went to the window, to resume his contemplation\r\nof the cedar, and stood there with his back turned to Frank, and his\r\neyes going slowly over all the long processes of his self-argument,\r\nlaid up as they were upon those solemn levels of shadow. "Yes--you\r\nhave gone so far with me; but I don\'t want to take you any farther,\r\nFrank. Perhaps, when I have reached the perfect peace to which I am\r\nlooking forward, I may try to induce you to share it, but at present\r\nthere are so many pricks of the flesh. You did not come to argue with\r\nme, did you?" and again the half-humorous gleam of old came over\r\nGerald\'s face as he looked round. "Louisa believes in arguing," he\r\nsaid, as he came back to the table and took his seat again; "not that\r\nshe has ever gained much by it, so far as I am aware. Poor girl! she\r\ntalks and talks, and fancies she is persuading me; and all the time my\r\nheart is bleeding for her. There it is!" he exclaimed, suddenly hiding\r\nhis face in his hands. "This is what crushes one to think of. The rest\r\nis hard enough, Heaven knows--separation from my friends, giving up my\r\nown people, wounding and grieving, as I know I shall, everybody who\r\nloves me. I could bear that; but Louisa and her children--God help me,\r\nthere\'s the sting!"\r\n\r\nThey were both men, and strong men, not likely to fall into any\r\nsentimental weakness; but something between a groan and a sob, wrung\r\nout of the heart of the elder brother at the thought of the terrible\r\nsacrifice before him, echoed with a hard sound of anguish into the\r\nquiet. It was very different from his wife\'s trembling, weeping,\r\nhoping agony; but it reduced the Curate more than ever to that\r\nposition of spectator which he felt was so very far from the active\r\npart which his poor sister expected of him.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know by what steps you have reached this conclusion," said\r\nFrank Wentworth; "but even if you feel it your duty to give up the\r\nAnglican Church (in which, of course, I think you totally wrong,"\r\nadded the High Churchman in a parenthesis), "I cannot see why you are\r\nbound to abandon all duties whatever. I have not come to argue with\r\nyou; I daresay poor Louisa may expect it of me, but I can\'t, and you\r\nknow very well I can\'t. I should like to know how it has come about\r\nall the same; but one thing only, Gerald--a man may be a Christian\r\nwithout being a priest. Louisa--"\r\n\r\n"Hush, I am a priest, or nothing. I can\'t relinquish my life!" cried the\r\nelder brother, lifting his hands suddenly, as if to thrust away\r\nsomething which threatened him. Then he rose up again and went towards\r\nthe window and his cedar, which stood dark in the sunshine, slightly\r\nfluttered at its extremities by the light summer-wind, but throwing\r\nglorious level lines of shadow, which the wind could not disturb, upon\r\nthe grass. The limes near, and that one delicate feathery birch which\r\nwas Mrs Wentworth\'s pride, had all some interest of their own on hand,\r\nand went on waving, rustling, coquetting with the breezes and the\r\nsunshine in a way which precluded any arbitrary line of shade. But the\r\ncedar stood immovable, like a verdant monument, sweeping its long level\r\nbranches over the lawn, passive under the light, and indifferent, except\r\nat its very tops and edges, to the breeze. If there had been any human\r\nsentiment in that spectator of the ways of man, how it must have groaned\r\nand trembled under the pitiless weight of thoughts, the sad lines of\r\ndiscussion and argument and doubt, which were entangled in its branches!\r\nGerald Wentworth went to his window to refer to it, as if it were a book\r\nin which all his contests had been recorded. The thrill of the air in it\r\ntingled through him as he stood looking out; and there, without looking\r\nat Frank, except now and then for a moment when he got excited with his\r\nsubject, he went into the history of his struggle--a history not\r\nunprecedented or unparalleled, such as has been told to the world before\r\nnow by men who have gone through it, in various shapes, with various\r\namounts of sophistry and simplicity. But it is a different thing reading\r\nof such a conflict in a book, and hearing it from lips pallid with the\r\nmeaning of the words they uttered, and a heart which was about to prove\r\nits sincerity by voluntary pangs more hard than death. Frank Wentworth\r\nlistened to his brother with a great deal of agreement in what he said,\r\nand again with an acute perception of mistakes on Gerald\'s part, and\r\nvehement impulses of contradiction, to which, at the same time, it was\r\nimpossible to give utterance; for there was something very solemn in the\r\naccount he was giving of himself, as he stood with his face half turned\r\nto the anxious listener, leaning on the window, looking into the cedar.\r\nGerald did not leave any room for argument or remonstrance; he told his\r\nbrother how he had been led from one step to another, without any\r\nlingering touch of possibility in the narrative that he might be\r\ninduced to retrace again that painful way. It was a path, once trod,\r\nnever to be returned upon; and already he stood steadfast at the end,\r\nlooking back mournfully, yet with a strange composure. It would be\r\nimpossible to describe the mixture of love, admiration, impatience--even\r\nintolerance--which swelled through the mind of the spectator as he\r\nlooked on at this wonderful sight, nor how hard he found it to restrain\r\nthe interruptions which rushed to his lips, the eager arguments which\r\ncame upon him in a flood, all his own favourite fences against the\r\noverflow of the tide which ran in lawful bounds in his own mind, but\r\nwhich had inundated his brother\'s. But though it was next to impossible\r\nto keep silence, it was altogether impossible to break in upon Gerald\'s\r\nhistory of this great battle through which he had just come. He _had_\r\ncome through it, it was plain; the warfare was accomplished, the weapons\r\nhung up, the conflict over; and nothing could be more apparent than that\r\nhe had no intention of entering the battle-field again. When he had\r\nended, there was another pause.\r\n\r\n"I am not going to argue with you," said Frank Wentworth; "I don\'t even\r\nneed to tell you that I am grieved to the heart. It isn\'t so very many\r\nyears ago," said the younger brother, almost too much touched by the\r\nrecollection to preserve his composure, "since I took all my opinions\r\nfrom you; and since the time came for independent action, I too have\r\ngone over all this ground. My conclusions have been very different from\r\nyours, Gerald. I see you are convinced, and I can say nothing; but they\r\ndo not convince me--you do not convince me, nor the sight of your faith,\r\nthough that is the most touching of all arguments. Will you go back and\r\ngo over it again?" said the Curate, spurred, by a thought of poor\r\nLouisa, to contradict himself, while the words were still on his lips.\r\n\r\n"No," said Gerald; "it would be of no use, Frank. We should only grieve\r\neach other more."\r\n\r\n"Then I give up that subject," said the younger brother: "but there\r\nis one matter which I must go back to. You may go to Rome, and cease\r\nto be a priest of the Anglican Church, but you cannot cease to be a\r\nman, to bear the weight of your natural duties. Don\'t turn away, but\r\nhear me. Gerald, Louisa--"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t say any more. Do you imagine I have not thought of that?" said\r\nGerald, once more, with a gesture of pain, and something like terror;\r\n"I have put my hand to the plough and I cannot go back. If I am not a\r\npriest, I am nothing." But when he came to that point, his cedar-tree\r\nno longer gave him any assistance; he came back to his chair, and\r\ncovered his face with his hands.\r\n\r\n"Louisa is your wife; you are not like a man free from the bonds of\r\nnature," said the Curate of St Roque\'s. "It is not for me to speak of\r\nthe love between you; but I hold it, as the Scripture says, for a holy\r\nmystery, like the love of Christ for his Church--the most sacred of\r\nall bonds," said the young man, with a certain touch of awe and\r\nemotion, as became a young man and a true lover. He made a little\r\npause to regain command of himself before he continued, "And she is\r\ndependent on you--outwardly, for all the comfort of her life--and in\r\nher heart, for everything, Gerald. I do not comprehend what that duty\r\nis which could make you leave her, all helpless and tender, as you\r\nknow her to be, upon the mercies of the world. She herself says"--and\r\npoor Louisa\'s complaint grew into pathos under the subliming force of\r\nher advocate\'s sympathy--"that she would be like a widow, and worse\r\nthan a widow. I am not the man to bid you suppress your convictions\r\nbecause they will be your ruin, in the common sense of the word; but,\r\nGerald--your wife--"\r\n\r\nGerald had bent his head down upon his clasped hands; sometimes a\r\ngreat heave of his frame showed the last struggle that was going on\r\nwithin him--a struggle more painful, more profound, than anything that\r\nhad gone before. And the voice of the Curate, who, like his brother,\r\nwas nothing if not a priest, was choked, and painful with the force\r\nof his emotion. He drew his breath hard between his words: it was not\r\nan argument, but an admonition; an appeal, not from a brother only,\r\nbut from one who spoke with authority, as feeling himself accredited\r\nfrom God. He drew closer towards the voluntary martyr beside him, the\r\nhumbleness of his reverential love for his elder brother mingling in\r\nthat voice of the priest, which was natural to him, and which he did\r\nnot scruple to adopt. "Gerald,--your wife," he said, in softened but\r\nfirm tones, laying his hand on his brother\'s arm. And it was at this\r\nmoment, when in his heart he felt that his influence might be of some\r\navail, and when all the powers of his mind were gathering to bear upon\r\nthis last experiment, that the door opened suddenly, and poor Louisa,\r\nall flushed and tearful, in womanish hot impatience and misery that\r\nknew no prudence, burst, without any warning, into the room.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t bear it any longer," cried the poor wife. "I knew you were\r\ntalking it all over, and deciding what it was to be; and when one\'s\r\nlife is hanging on a chance, how can one keep quiet and not interfere?\r\nOh, Gerald, Gerald! I have been a true wife to you. I know I am not\r\nclever; but I would have died to do you any good. You are not going to\r\nforsake me!" cried poor Louisa, going up to him and putting her arms\r\nround him. "I said Frank was to tell you everything, but a man can\r\nnever tell what is in a woman\'s heart. Oh, Gerald, why should you go\r\nand kill me! I will never oppose you any more; whatever you want, I\r\nwill give in to it as freely as if it were my own way. I will make\r\n_that_ my own way, Gerald, if you will only listen to me. Whatever\r\nchanges you please, oh Gerald, I will never say a word, nor your\r\nfather, nor any one! If the Bishop should interfere, we would all\r\nstand up for you. There is not a soul in Wentworth to oppose--you know\r\nthere is not. Put anything you please in the church--preach how you\r\nplease--light the candles or anything. Gerald, you know it is true I\r\nam saying--I am not trying to deceive you!" cried the poor soul,\r\nbewildered in her folly and her grief.\r\n\r\n"No, Louisa, no--only you don\'t understand," said her husband, with a\r\ngroan: he had raised his head, and was looking at her with a hopeless\r\ngleam of impatience in the pity and anguish of his eyes. He took her\r\nlittle hand and held it between his own, which were trembling with all\r\nthis strain--her little tender helpless woman\'s hand, formed only for\r\nsoft occupations and softer caresses; it was not a hand which could\r\nhelp a man in such an emergency; it was without any grasp in it to\r\ntake hold upon him, or force of love to part--a clinging impotent\r\nhand, such as holds down, but cannot raise up. He held it in a close\r\ntremulous pressure, as she stood looking down upon him, questioning\r\nhim with eager hopeful eyes, and taking comfort in her ignorance from\r\nhis silence, and the way in which he held her. Poor Louisa concluded\r\nshe was yet to win the day.\r\n\r\n"I will turn Puseyite too," she said with a strange little touch of\r\nattempted laughter. "I don\'t want to have any opinions different from\r\nmy husband\'s; and you don\'t think your father is likely to do anything\r\nto drive you out of the church? You have only given us a terrible\r\nfright, dear," she continued, beginning to tremble again, as he shook\r\nhis head and turned away from her. "You did not really mean such a\r\ndreadful thing as sending _me_ away. You could not do without me,\r\nGerald--you know you could not." Her breath was getting short, her\r\nheart quickening in its throbs--the smile that was quivering on her\r\nface got no response from her husband\'s downcast eyes. And then poor\r\nLouisa lost all her courage; she threw herself down at his feet,\r\nkneeling to him. "Oh, Gerald, it is not because you want to get rid of\r\nme? You are not doing it for that? If you don\'t stay in the Rectory,\r\nwe shall be ruined--we shall not have enough to eat! and the Rectory\r\nwill go to Frank, and your children will be cast upon the world--and\r\nwhat, oh what is it for, unless it is to get rid of me?" cried Mrs\r\nWentworth. "You could have as much freedom as you like here at your\r\nown living--nobody would ever interfere or say what are you doing?\r\nand the Bishop is papa\'s old friend. Oh, Gerald, be wise in time, and\r\ndon\'t throw away all our happiness for a fancy. If it was anything\r\nthat could not be arranged, I would not mind so much; but if we all\r\npromise to give in to you, and that you shall do what you please, and\r\nnobody will interfere, how can you have the heart to make us all so\r\nwretched? We will not even be respectable," said the weeping woman; "a\r\nfamily without any father, and a wife without her husband--and he\r\nliving all the time! Oh, Gerald, though I think I surely might be\r\nconsidered as much as candles, have the altar covered with lights if\r\nyou wish it; and if you never took off your surplice any more, I would\r\nnever say a word. You can do all that and stay in the Rectory. You\r\nhave not the heart--surely--surely you have not the heart--all for an\r\nidea of your own, to bring this terrible distress upon the children\r\nand me?"\r\n\r\n"God help us all!" said Gerald, with a sigh of despair, as he lifted\r\nher up sobbing in a hysterical fit, and laid her on the sofa. He had\r\nto stand by her side for a long time holding her hand, and soothing\r\nher, with deeper and deeper shadows growing over his face. As for\r\nFrank, after pacing the room in great agitation for some time, after\r\ntrying to interpose, and failing, he went away in a fever of\r\nimpatience and distress into the garden, wondering whether he could\r\never find means to take up the broken thread, and urge again upon his\r\nbrother the argument which, but for this fatal interruption, he\r\nthought might have moved him. But gathering thoughts came thick upon\r\nthe Perpetual Curate. He did not go back to make another attempt, even\r\nwhen he knew by the sounds through the open windows that Louisa had\r\nbeen led to her own room up-stairs. He stood outside and looked at the\r\ntroubled house, which seemed to stand so serene and secure in the\r\nsunshine. Who could have supposed that it was torn asunder in such a\r\nhopeless fashion? And Louisa\'s suggestion came into his mind, and\r\ndrove him wild with a sense of horror and involuntary guilt, as\r\nthough he had been conspiring against them. "The Rectory will go to\r\nFrank." Was it his fault that at that moment a vision of Lucy\r\nWodehouse, sweet and strong and steadfast--a delicate, firm figure, on\r\nwhich a man could lean in his trouble--suddenly rose up before the\r\nCurate\'s eyes? Fair as the vision was, he would have banished it if he\r\ncould, and hated himself for being capable of conjuring it up at such\r\na time. Was it for him to profit by the great calamity which would\r\nmake his brother\'s house desolate? He could not endure the thought,\r\nnor himself for finding it possible; and he was ashamed to look in\r\nGerald\'s face with even the shadow of such an imagination on his own.\r\nHe tapped at the library window after a while, and told his brother\r\nthat he was going up to the Hall. Louisa had gone up-stairs, and her\r\nhusband sat once more, vacant yet occupied, by his writing-table. "I\r\nwill follow you presently," said Gerald. "Speak to my father without\r\nany hesitation, Frank; it is better to have it over while we are all\r\ntogether--for it must be concluded now." And the Curate saw in the\r\nshadow of the dim apartment that his brother lifted from the table the\r\ngrand emblem of all anguish and victory, and pressed upon it his pale\r\nlips. The young man turned away with the shadow of that cross standing\r\nblack between him and the sunshine. His heart ached at the sight of\r\nthe symbol most sacred and most dear in the world. In an agony of\r\ngrief and impatience, he went away sadly through the familiar road to\r\nhis father\'s house. Here had he to stand by and see this sacrifice\r\naccomplished. This was all that had come of his mission of consolation\r\nand help.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Curate of St Roque\'s went sadly along the road he knew so well\r\nfrom Wentworth Rectory to the Hall. There was scarcely a tree nor the\r\nturning of a hedgerow which had not its own individual memories to the\r\nson of the soil. Here he had come to meet Gerald returning from\r\nEton--coming back from the university in later days. Here he had\r\nrushed down to the old Rector, his childless uncle, with the copy of\r\nthe prize-list when his brother took his first-class. Gerald, and the\r\nfamily pride in him, was interwoven with the very path, and now--The\r\nyoung man pressed on to the Hall with a certain bitter moisture\r\nstealing to the corner of his eye. He felt indignant and aggrieved in\r\nhis love, not at Gerald, but at the causes which were conspiring to\r\ndetach him from his natural sphere and duties. When he recollected how\r\nhe had himself dallied with the same thoughts, he grew angry with his\r\nbrother\'s nobleness and purity, which never could see less than its\r\nhighest ideal soul in anything, and with a certain fierce fit of\r\ntruth, glanced back at his own Easter lilies and choristers, feeling\r\ninvoluntarily that he would like to tear off the flowers and surplices\r\nand tread them under his feet. Why was it that he, an inferior man,\r\nshould be able to confine himself to the mere accessories which\r\npleased his fancy, and could judge and reject the dangerous principles\r\nbeneath; while Gerald, the loftier, purer intelligence, should get so\r\nhopelessly lost in mazes of sophistry and false argument, to the peril\r\nof his work, his life, and all that he could ever know of happiness?\r\nSuch were the thoughts that passed through the mind of the Perpetual\r\nCurate as he went rapidly through the winding country-road going\r\n"home." Perhaps he was wrong in thinking that Gerald was thus superior\r\nto himself; but the error was a generous one, and the Curate held it\r\nin simplicity and with all his heart.\r\n\r\nBefore he reached the house he saw his father walking under the\r\nlime-trees, which formed a kind of lateral aisle to the great avenue,\r\nwhich was one of the boasts of the Wentworths. The Squire was like most\r\nsquires of no particular character; a hale, ruddy, clear-complexioned,\r\nwell-preserved man, looking his full age, but retaining all the vigour\r\nof his youth. He was not a man of any intellect to speak of, nor did he\r\npretend to it; but he had that glimmering of sense which keeps many a\r\nstupid man straight, and a certain amount of natural sensibility and\r\nconsideration for other people\'s feelings which made persons who knew no\r\nbetter give Mr Wentworth credit for tact, a quality unknown to him. He\r\nwas walking slowly in a perplexed manner under the lime-trees. They were\r\nall in glorious blossom, filling the air with that mingling sense of\r\nfragrance and music which is the soul of the murmurous tree: but the\r\nshort figure of the Squire, in his morning-coat, with his perplexed\r\nlooks, was not at all an accessory in keeping with the scene. He was\r\ntaking his walk in a subdued way, pondering something--and it puzzled\r\nhim sorely in his straightforward, unprofound understanding. He shook\r\nhis head sometimes as he went along, sad and perplexed and\r\nunsatisfactory, among his limes. He had got a note from Gerald that\r\nmorning; and how his son could intend to give up living and station, and\r\nwife and children, for anything in heaven or earth, was more than the\r\nSquire could understand. He started very much when he heard Frank\'s\r\nvoice calling to him. Frank, indeed, was said to be, if any one was, the\r\nSquire\'s weakness in the family; he was as clever as Gerald, and he had\r\nthe practical sense which Mr Wentworth prized as knowing himself to\r\npossess it. If he could have wished for any one in the present\r\nemergency, it would have been Frank--and he turned round overjoyed.\r\n\r\n"Frank, my boy, you\'re heartily welcome home!" he said, holding out\r\nhis hand to him as became a British parent--"always welcome, but\r\nparticularly just now. Where did you come from? how did you come? have\r\nyou eaten anything this morning? it\'s close upon lunch, and we\'ll go\r\nin directly; but, my dear boy, wait here a moment, if you\'re not\r\nparticularly hungry; I can\'t tell you how glad I am you\'re come. I\'d\r\nrather see you than a hundred pound!"\r\n\r\nWhen Frank had thanked him, and returned his greetings, and answered\r\nhis questions (which the Squire had forgotten), and made his own\r\ninquiries, to which Mr Wentworth replied only by a hasty nod, and an\r\n"Oh yes, thank you, all well--all well," the two came to a momentary\r\npause: they had nothing particular to add about their happiness in\r\nseeing each other; and as Frank wrote to his sisters pretty regularly,\r\nthere was nothing to tell. They were quite free to plunge at once, as\r\nis to British relatives under the trying circumstances of a meeting a\r\nblessed possibility, into the first great subject which happened to be\r\nat hand.\r\n\r\n"Have you heard anything about Gerald?" said Mr Wentworth, abruptly;\r\n"perhaps you called there on your way from the station? Gerald has got\r\ninto a nice mess. He wrote to tell me about it, and I can\'t make head\r\nnor tail of it. Do you think he\'s a little touched here?" and the\r\nSquire tapped his own round forehead, with a troubled look: "there\'s\r\nno other explanation possible that I can see: a good living, a nice\r\nhouse, a wife that just suits him (and it\'s not everybody that would\r\nsuit Gerald), and a lot of fine children--and he talks to me of giving\r\nup everything; as if a man could give up everything! It\'s all very\r\nwell talking of self-renunciation, and so forth; and if it meant\r\nsimply considering other people, and doing anything disagreeable for\r\nanybody\'s sake, I don\'t know a man more likely than my son Gerald.\r\nYour brother\'s a fine fellow, Frank--a noble sort of fellow, though\r\nhe has his crotchets," said the father, with a touch of involuntary\r\npathos; "but you don\'t mean to tell me that my son, a man like Gerald\r\nWentworth, has a mind to throw away his position, and give up all the\r\nduties of his life? He can\'t do it, sir! I tell you it\'s impossible,\r\nand I won\'t believe it." Mr Wentworth drew up his shirt-collar, and\r\nkicked away a fallen branch with his foot, and looked insulted and\r\nangry. It was a dereliction of which he would not suppose the\r\npossibility of a Wentworth being guilty. It did not strike him as a\r\nconflict between belief and non-belief; but on the question of a man\r\nabandoning his post, whatever it might be, the head of the house held\r\nstrong views.\r\n\r\n"I agree it\'s impossible; but it looks as if it were true," said the\r\nCurate. "I don\'t understand it any more than you do; but I am afraid\r\nwe shall have to address ourselves to the reality all the same. Gerald\r\nhas made up his mind that the Church of Rome is the only true Church,\r\nand therefore he is in a false position in the Church of England: he\r\ncan\'t remain a priest of the Anglican communion with such views, any\r\nmore than a man could fight against his country, or in a wrong\r\nquarrel--"\r\n\r\n"But, good heavens, sir!" said the Squire, interrupting him, "is it a\r\ntime to inquire into the quarrel when you\'re on the ground? Will you\r\ntell me, sir, that my son Charley should have gone into the question\r\nbetween Russia and England when he was before Sebastopol--and\r\ndeserted," said Mr Wentworth, with a snort of infinite scorn, "if he\r\nfound the Czar had right on his side? God bless my soul! that\'s\r\nstriking at the root of everything. As for the Church of Rome, it\'s\r\nAntichrist--why, every child in the village school could tell you\r\nthat; and if Gerald entertains any such absurd ideas, the thing for\r\nhim to do is to read up all that\'s been written on the subject, and\r\nget rid of his doubts as soon as possible. The short and the long of\r\nit is," said the troubled Squire, who found it much the easiest way to\r\nbe angry, "that you ask me to believe that your brother Gerald is a\r\nfool and a coward; and I won\'t believe it, Frank, if you should preach\r\nto me for a year."\r\n\r\n"And for my part, I would stake my life on his wisdom and his\r\ncourage," said the Curate, with a little heat; "but that is not the\r\nquestion--he believes that truth and honour require him to leave his\r\npost. There is something more involved which we might yet prevent. I\r\nhave been trying, but Louisa interrupted me--I don\'t know if you\r\nrealise fully what he intends. Gerald cannot cease to be a priest--he\r\nwill become a Catholic priest when he ceases to be Rector of\r\nWentworth--and that implies--"\r\n\r\n"God bless my soul!" cried the bewildered Squire--he was silent for a\r\nlong time after he had uttered that benediction. He took out Gerald\'s\r\nletter and read it over while the two walked on in silence under the\r\nlime-trees, and the paper shook in his hands, notwithstanding all his\r\nsteadiness. When he spoke again, it was only after two or three\r\nefforts to clear his voice. "I can\'t make out that he says _that_,\r\nFrank--I don\'t see that _that\'s_ what he means," said Mr Wentworth, in\r\na fainter tone than usual; and then he continued, with more agitation,\r\n"Louisa is a dear good soul, you know; but she\'s a bit of a fool, like\r\nmost women. She always takes the worst view--if she can get a good cry\r\nout of anything, she will. It\'s she that\'s put this fancy into your\r\nhead, eh? You don\'t say you had it from Gerald himself? You don\'t mean\r\nto tell me that? By Jove, sir!--by heaven, sir!" cried the excited\r\nSquire, blazing up suddenly in a burst of passion, "he can\'t be any\r\nson of mine--For any damnable Papistical madness to give up his wife!\r\nWhy, God bless us, he was a man, wasn\'t he, before he became a priest?\r\nA priest! He\'s not a priest--he\'s a clergyman, and the Rector of\r\nWentworth. I can\'t believe it--I won\'t believe it!" said the head of\r\nthe house, with vehemence. "Tell me one of my sons is a sneak and a\r\ntraitor!--and if you weren\'t another of my sons, sir, I\'d knock you\r\ndown for your pains." In the excitement of the moment Mr Wentworth\r\ncame full force against a projecting branch which he did not see, as\r\nhe spoke these words; but though the sudden blow half stunned him, he\r\ndid not stop in his vehement contradiction. "It can\'t be. I tell you\r\nit can\'t--it shan\'t be, Frank!" cried the Squire. He would not pay any\r\nattention to the Curate\'s anxieties, or accept the arm Frank offered,\r\nthough he could not deny feeling faint and giddy after the blow. It\r\ntook away all the colour from his ruddy face, and left him pale, with\r\na red welt across his forehead, and wonderfully unlike himself.\r\n"Confound it! I told Miles to look after that tree weeks ago. If he\r\nthinks I\'ll stand his carelessness, he\'s mistaken," said Mr Wentworth,\r\nby way of relieving himself. He was a man who always eased his mind by\r\nbeing angry with somebody when anything happened to put him out.\r\n\r\n"My dear father," said the Curate as soon as it was practicable, "I\r\nwant you to listen to me and help me; there\'s only one thing to be\r\ndone that I can see. Gerald is in a state of high excitement, fit for\r\nany martyrdom. We can\'t keep him back from one sacrifice, but by all\r\nthe force we can gather we must detain him from the other. He must be\r\nshown that he can\'t abandon his natural duties. He was a man before he\r\nwas a priest, as you say; he can no more give up his duty to Louisa\r\nthan he can give up his own life. It is going on a false idea\r\naltogether; but falsehood in anything except in argument could never\r\nbe named or dreamed of in connection with Gerald," said his brother,\r\nwith some emotion; "we all know that."\r\n\r\nThere was another pause of a few minutes, during which they walked on\r\nside by side without even the heart to look at each other. "If it had\r\nbeen Huxtable or Plumstead, or any other fool," burst forth the\r\nSquire, after that interval, "but Gerald!" Huxtable was the husband of\r\nthe eldest Miss Wentworth, and Plumstead was the Squire\'s sister\'s\r\nson, so the comparison was all in the family. "I suppose your aunt\r\nLeonora would say such a thing was sent to bring down my pride and\r\nkeep me low," said Mr Wentworth, bitterly. "Jack being what he is,\r\nwas it anything but natural that I should be proud of Gerald? There\r\nnever was any evil in him, that I could see, from a child; but\r\ncrotchety, always crotchety, Frank. I can see it now. It must have\r\nbeen their mother," said the Squire, meditatively; "she died very\r\nyoung, poor girl! her character was not formed. As for _your_ dear\r\nmother, my boy, she was always equal to an emergency; she would have\r\ngiven us the best of advice, had she been spared to us this day. Mrs\r\nWentworth is absorbed in her nursery, as is natural, and I should not\r\ncare to consult her much on such a subject. But, Frank, whatever you\r\ncan do or say, trust to me to back you out," said the anxious father\r\nof three families. "Your mother was the most sensible woman I ever\r\nknew," he continued, with a patriarchal composure. "Nobody could ever\r\nmanage Jack and Gerald as she did. She\'d have seen at a glance what to\r\ndo now. As for Jack, he is not assistance to anybody; but I consider\r\nyou very like your mother, Frank. If anybody can help Gerald, it will\r\nbe you. He has got into some ridiculous complications, you know--that\r\nmust be the explanation of it. You have only to talk to him, and clear\r\nup the whole affair," said the Squire, recovering himself a little. He\r\nbelieved in "talking to," like Louisa, and like most people who are\r\nutterly incapable of talking to any purpose. He took some courage from\r\nthe thought, and recovered his colour a little. "There is the bell for\r\nluncheon, and I am very glad of it," he said; "a glass of sherry will\r\nset me all right. Don\'t say anything to alarm Mrs Wentworth. When\r\nGerald comes we\'ll retire to the library, and go into the matter\r\ncalmly, and between us we will surely be able to convince him. I\'ll\r\nhumour him, for my part, as far as my conscience will allow me. We\r\nmust not give in to him, Frank. He will give it up if we show a very\r\nfirm front and yield nothing," said the Squire, looking with an\r\nunusually anxious eye in his son\'s face.\r\n\r\n"For my part, I will not enter into the controversy between the\r\nChurches," said the Curate; "it is mere waste of time. I must confine\r\nmyself to the one point. If he must forsake us, he must, and I can\'t\r\nstop him: but he must not forsake his wife."\r\n\r\n"Tut--it\'s impossible!" said the Squire; "it\'s not to be thought of\r\nfor a moment. You must have given undue importance to something that\r\nwas said. Things will turn out better than you think." They were very\r\nnearly at the great entrance when these words were said, and Mr\r\nWentworth took out his handkerchief and held it to his forehead to\r\nveil the mark, until he could explain it, from the anxious eye of his\r\nwife. "If the worst should come to the worst, as you seem to think,"\r\nhe said, with a kind of sigh, "I should at least be able to provide\r\nfor you, Frank. Of course, the Rectory would go to you; and you don\'t\r\nseem to have much chance of Skelmersdale, so far as I can learn.\r\nLeonora\'s a very difficult person to deal with. God bless my soul!"\r\nexclaimed the Squire--"depend upon it, she has had something to do\r\nwith this business of Gerald\'s. She\'s goaded him into it, with her\r\nLow-Church ways. She\'s put poor Louisa up to worrying him; there\'s\r\nwhere it is. I did not see how your brother could possibly have fallen\r\ninto such a blunder of his own accord. But come to luncheon; you must\r\nbe hungry. You will think the boys grown, Frank; and I must ask you\r\nwhat you think, when you have a little leisure, of Cuthbert and Guy."\r\n\r\nSo saying, the Squire led the way into the house; he had been much\r\nappalled by the first hint of this threatened calamity, and was\r\nseriously distressed and anxious still; but he was the father of many\r\nsons, and the misfortunes or blunders of one could not occupy all his\r\nheart. And even the Curate, as he followed his father into the house,\r\nfelt that Louisa\'s words, so calmly repeated, "Of course, the Rectory\r\nwill go to you," went tingling to his heart like an arrow, painfully\r\nrecalling him, in the midst of his anxiety, to a sense of his own\r\ninterests and cares. Gerald was coming up the avenue at the moment\r\nslowly, with all the feelings of a man going to the stake. He was\r\nlooking at everything round as a dying man might, not knowing what\r\nterrible revolution of life might have happened before he saw them\r\nagain--\r\n\r\n   "He looked on hill, and sea, and shore,\r\n    As he might never see them more."\r\n\r\nLife was darkened over to his preoccupied eyes, and the composure of\r\nnature jarred upon him, as though it were carelessness and indifference\r\nto the fate which he felt to be coming in the air. He thought nothing\r\nless than that his father and brother were discussing him with hearts as\r\nheavy and clouded as his own; for even he, in all his tolerance and\r\nimpartiality, did not make due account of the fact, that every man has\r\nhis own concerns next to him, close enough to ameliorate and lighten the\r\nweight of his anxieties for others. The prospect was all gloom to\r\nGerald, who was the sufferer; but the others found gleams of comfort in\r\ntheir own horizon, which threw reflected lights upon his; for perfect\r\nsympathy is not, except in dreams. There was quite a joyful little\r\ncommotion at the luncheon table when Frank\'s arrival was discovered; and\r\nhis sisters were kissing him, and his young brothers shaking his hand\r\noff, while Gerald came slowly up, with preoccupied, lingering steps,\r\nunderneath the murmurous limes. All kinds of strange miseries were\r\nappearing to him as he pursued his way. Glimpses of scenes to come--a\r\ndark phantasmagoria of anticipated pain. He saw his wife and his\r\nchildren going away out of their happy house; he saw himself severed\r\nfrom all human ties, among alien faces and customs, working out a hard\r\nnovitiate. What could he do? His heart, so long on the rack, was aching\r\nwith dull throbs of anguish, but he did not see any way of escape. He\r\nwas a priest by all the training, all the habits of his life; how could\r\nhe give up that service to which he was called before everything, the\r\nmost momentous work on earth? For ease, for happiness, for even sacred\r\nlove, could he defraud God of the service he had vowed, and go back to\r\nsecular work just at the moment when the true meaning of ecclesiastical\r\nwork seemed dawning upon him? He had decided that question before, but\r\nit came back and back. His eyes were heavy with thought and conflict as\r\nhe went up to his father\'s house. All this was wearing out his strength,\r\nand sapping his very life. The sooner it was over the better would it be\r\nfor all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nVery little came, as was natural, of the talk in the library, to which\r\nthe entire afternoon was devoted. The Squire, in his way, was as great\r\nan interruption to the arguments of the Curate as was poor Louisa in\r\nhers; and Gerald sat patiently to listen to his father\'s indignant\r\nmonologue, broken as it was by Frank\'s more serious attacks. He was\r\nprepared for all they could say to him, and listened to it, sometimes\r\nwith a kind of wondering smile, knowing well how much more strongly,\r\nbacked by all his prejudices and interests, he had put the same\r\narguments to himself. All this time nobody discussed the practicability\r\nof the matter much, nor what steps he meant to take: what immediately\r\noccupied both his father and brother was his determination itself, and\r\nthe reasons which had led him to it, which the Squire, like Louisa,\r\ncould not understand.\r\n\r\n"If I had made myself disagreeable," said Mr Wentworth; "if I had\r\nremonstrated with him, as Leonora urged me to do; if I had put a stop to\r\nthe surplice and so forth, and interfered with his decorations or his\r\nsaints\' days, or anything, it might have been comprehensible. But I\r\nnever said a syllable on the subject. I give you my word, I never did.\r\nWhy couldn\'t he have sent down for Louisa now, and dined at the Hall, as\r\nusual, when any of my sons come home? I suppose a man may change his\r\nreligion, sir, without getting rid of his natural affections," said the\r\nSquire, gazing out with puzzled looks to watch Gerald going slowly down\r\nthe avenue. "A man who talks of leaving his wife, and declines to dine\r\nat his father\'s house with his brothers and sisters, is a mystery I\r\ncan\'t understand."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t suppose he cares for a lively party like ours at this moment,"\r\nsaid the Curate: "I don\'t take it as any sign of a want of affection for\r\nme."\r\n\r\nThe Squire puffed forth a large sigh of trouble and vexation as he\r\ncame from the window. "If _I_ were to give in to trouble when it\r\nappears, what would become of our lively party, I wonder?" he said.\r\n"I\'m getting an old man, Frank; but there\'s not a young man in\r\nChristendom has more need to take care of himself, and preserve his\r\nhealth, than I have. I am very well, thank God, though I have had a\r\ntouch of our Wentworth complaint--just one touch. My father had it ten\r\nyears earlier in life, and lived to eighty, all the same; but that is\r\nan age I shall never see. Such worries as I have would kill any man.\r\nI\'ve not spoken to anybody about it," said the Squire, hastily, "but\r\nJack is going a terrible pace just now. I\'ve had a good deal of bother\r\nabout bills and things. He gets worse every year; and what would\r\nbecome of the girls and the little children if the estate were to come\r\ninto Jack\'s hands, is a thought I don\'t like to dwell upon, Frank. I\r\nsuppose he never writes to you?"\r\n\r\n"Not for years past," said the Curate--"not since I was at Oxford.\r\nWhere is he now?"\r\n\r\n"Somewhere about town, I suppose," said the aggrieved father, "or\r\nwherever the greatest scamps collect when they go out of town--that\'s\r\nwhere he is. I could show you a little document or two, Frank--but\r\nnow," said the Squire, shutting up a drawer which he had unlocked and\r\npartly opened, "I won\'t; you\'ve enough on your mind with Gerald, and\r\nI told you I should be glad of your advice about Cuthbert and Guy."\r\n\r\nUpon which the father and son plunged into family affairs. Cuthbert\r\nand Guy were the youngest of the Squire\'s middle family--a "lot" which\r\nincluded Frank and Charley and the three sisters, one of whom was\r\nmarried. The domestic relations of the Wentworths were complicated in\r\nthis generation. Jack and Gerald were of the first marriage, a period\r\nin his history which Mr Wentworth himself had partly forgotten; and\r\nthe troop of children at present in the Hall nursery were quite beyond\r\nthe powers of any grown-up brother to recognise or identify. It was\r\nvaguely understood that "the girls" knew all the small fry by head and\r\nname, but even the Squire himself was apt to get puzzled. With such a\r\nhousehold, and with an heir impending over his head like Jack, it may\r\nbe supposed that Mr Wentworth\'s anxiety to get his younger boys\r\ndisposed of was great. Cuthbert and Guy were arrows in the hand of the\r\ngiant, but he had his quiver so full that the best thing he could do\r\nwas to draw his bow and shoot them away into as distant and as fresh a\r\nsphere as possible. They were sworn companions and allies, but they\r\nwere not clever, Mr Wentworth believed, and he was very glad to\r\nconsult over New Zealand and Australia, and which was best, with their\r\nbrother Frank.\r\n\r\n"They are good boys," said their father, "but they have not any brains\r\nto speak of--not like Gerald and you;--though, after all, I begin to be\r\ndoubtful what\'s the good of brains," added the Squire, disconsolately,\r\n"if this is all that comes of them. After building so much on Gerald for\r\nyears, and feeling that one might live to see him a bishop--but,\r\nhowever, there\'s still _you_ left; you\'re all right, Frank?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, I am all right," said the Curate, with a sigh; "but neither\r\nGerald nor I are the stuff that bishops are made of," he added,\r\nlaughing. "I hope you don\'t dream of any such honour for me."\r\n\r\nBut the Squire was too troubled in his mind for laughter. "Jack was\r\nalways clever, too," he said, dolefully, "and little good has come of\r\nthat. I hope he won\'t disgrace the family any more than he has done, in\r\nmy time, Frank. You young fellows have all your life before you; but\r\nwhen a man comes to my age, and expects a little comfort, it\'s hard to\r\nbe dragged into the mire after his children. I did my duty by Jack\r\ntoo--I can say that for myself. He had the same training as Gerald\r\nhad--the same tutor at the university--everything just the same. How do\r\nyou account for that, sir, you that are a philosopher?" said Mr\r\nWentworth again, with a touch of irritation. "Own brothers both by\r\nfather and mother; brought up in the same house, same school and college\r\nand everything; and all the time as different from each other as light\r\nand darkness. How do you account for that? Though, to be sure, here\'s\r\nGerald taken to bad ways too. It must have been some weakness by their\r\nmother\'s side. Poor girl! she died too young to show it herself; but\r\nit\'s come out in her children," said the vexed Squire. "Though it\'s a\r\npoor sort of thing to blame them that are gone," he added, with\r\npenitence; and he got up and paced uneasily about the room. Who was\r\nthere else to blame? Not himself, for he had done his duty by his boys.\r\nMr Wentworth never was disturbed in mind, without, as his family were\r\nwell aware, becoming excited in temper too; and the unexpected nature of\r\nthe new trouble had somehow added a keener touch of exasperation to his\r\nperennial dissatisfaction with his heir. "If Jack had been the man he\r\nought to have been, his advice might have done some good--for a\r\nclergyman naturally sees things in a different light from a man of the\r\nworld," said the troubled father; and Frank perceived that he too shared\r\nin his father\'s displeasure, because he was not Jack, nor a man of the\r\nworld; notwithstanding that, being Frank and a clergyman, he was\r\nacknowledged by public opinion to be the Squire\'s favourite in the\r\nfamily. Things continued in this uncomfortable state up to the\r\ndinner-hour, so that the Curate, even had his own feelings permitted it,\r\nhad but little comfort in his home visit. At dinner Mr Wentworth did not\r\neat, and awoke the anxiety of his wife, who drove the old gentleman into\r\na state of desperation by inquiries after his health.\r\n\r\n"Indeed, I wish you would remonstrate with your papa, Frank," said his\r\nstepmother, who was not a great deal older than the Curate. "After his\r\nattack he ought to be more careful. But he never takes the least\r\ntrouble about himself, no more than if he were five-and-twenty. After\r\ngetting such a knock on the forehead too; and you see he eats nothing.\r\nI shall be miserable if the doctor is not sent for to-night."\r\n\r\n"Stuff!" cried the Squire, testily. "Perhaps you will speak to the cook\r\nabout these messes she insists on sending up to disgust one, and leave\r\nme to take care of my own health. Don\'t touch that dish, Frank; it\'s\r\npoison. I am glad Gerald is not here: he\'d think we never had a dinner\r\nwithout that confounded mixture. And then the wonder is that one can\'t\r\neat!" said Mr Wentworth, in a tone which spread consternation round the\r\ntable. Mrs Wentworth secretly put her handkerchief to her eyes behind\r\nthe great cover, which had not yet been removed; and one of the girls\r\ndashed in violently to the rescue, of course making everything worse.\r\n\r\n"Why did not Gerald and Louisa come to dinner?" cried the ignorant\r\nsister. "Surely, when they knew Frank had come, they would have liked to\r\nbe here. How very odd it was of you not to ask them, papa! they always\r\ndo come when anybody has arrived. Why aren\'t they here to-night?"\r\n\r\n"Because they don\'t choose to come," said the Squire, abruptly. "If\r\nGerald has reasons for staying away from his father\'s house, what is\r\nthat to you? Butterflies," said Mr Wentworth, looking at them in their\r\npretty dresses, as they sat regarding him with dismay, "that don\'t\r\nunderstand any reason for doing anything except liking it or not liking\r\nit. I daresay by this time your sister knows better."\r\n\r\n"My sister is married, papa," said Letty, with her saucy look.\r\n\r\n"I advise you to get married too, and learn what life is like," said the\r\nsavage Squire; and conversation visibly flagged after this effort. When\r\nthe ladies got safely into the drawing-room, they gathered into a corner\r\nto consult over it. They were all naturally anxious about him after his\r\n"attack."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you remember he was just like this before it came on?" said Mrs\r\nWentworth, nervously; "so cross, and finding fault with the made dishes.\r\nDon\'t you think I might send over a message to Dr Small--not to come on\r\npurpose, you know, but just as if it were a call in passing?"\r\n\r\nBut the girls both agreed this would make matters worse.\r\n\r\n"It must be something about Jack," they both said in a breath, in a\r\nkind of awe of their elder brother, of whom they had a very imperfect\r\nknowledge. "And it seems we never are to have a chance of a word with\r\nFrank!" cried Letty, who was indignant and exasperated. But at least\r\nit was a consolation that "the boys" were no better off. All next day\r\nCuthbert and Guy hung about in the vain hope of securing the company\r\nand attention of the visitor. He was at the Rectory the whole morning,\r\nsometimes with Gerald, sometimes with Louisa, as the scouts of the\r\nfamily, consisting of a variety of brothers, little and big, informed\r\nthe anxious girls. And Louisa was seen to cry on one of these\r\noccasions; and Gerald looked cross, said one little spy, whereupon he\r\nhad his ears boxed, and was dismissed from the service. "As if Gerald\r\never looked anything but a saint!" said the younger sister, who was an\r\nadvanced Anglican. Letty, however, holding other views, confuted this\r\nopinion strongly: "When one thinks of a saint, it is aunt Leonora one\r\nthinks of," said this profane young woman. "I\'ll tell you what Gerald\r\nlooks like--something just half-way between a conqueror and a martyr.\r\nI think, of all the men I ever saw, he is my hero," said Letty,\r\nmeditatively. The youngest Miss Wentworth was not exactly of this\r\nlatter opinion, but she did not contradict her sister. They were kept\r\nin a state of watchfulness all day, but Frank\'s mission remained a\r\nmystery which they could not penetrate; and in the evening Gerald\r\nalone made his appearance at the hall to dinner, explaining that\r\nLouisa had a headache. Now Louisa\'s headaches were not unfrequent, but\r\nthey were known to improve in the prospect of going out to dinner. On\r\nthe whole, the matter was wrapt in obscurity, and the Wentworth\r\nhousehold could not explain it. The sisters sat up brushing their\r\nhair, and looking very pretty in their dressing-gowns, with their\r\nbright locks (for the Wentworth hair was golden-brown of a Titian hue)\r\nover their shoulders, discussing the matter till it was long past\r\nmidnight; but they could make nothing of it, and the only conclusion\r\nthey came to was, that their two clergymen brothers were occupied in\r\nnegotiating with the Squire about some secret not known to the rest of\r\nthe family, but most probably concerning Jack. Jack was almost unknown\r\nto his sisters, and awoke no very warm anxiety in their minds; so they\r\nwent to sleep at last in tolerable quiet, concluding that whatever\r\nmystery there was concerned only the first-born and least loved of the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nWhile the girls pursued these innocent deliberations, and reasoned\r\nthemselves into conviction, the Squire too sat late--much later than\r\nusual. He had gone with Frank to the library, and sat there in\r\nhalf-stupefied quietness, which the Curate could not see without\r\nalarm, and from which he roused himself up now and then to wander off\r\ninto talk, which always began with Gerald, and always came back to his\r\nown anxieties and his disappointed hopes in his eldest son. "If Jack\r\nhad been the man he ought to have been, I\'d have telegraphed for him,\r\nand he\'d have managed it all," said the Squire, and then relapsed\r\nonce more into silence. "For neither you nor I are men of the world,\r\nFrank," he would resume again, after a pause of half an hour,\r\nrevealing pitifully how his mind laboured under the weight of this\r\nabsorbing thought. The Curate sat up with him in the dimly-lighted\r\nlibrary, feeling the silence and the darkness to his heart. He could\r\nnot assist his father in those dim ranges of painful meditation.\r\nGrieved as he was, he could not venture to compare his own distress\r\nwith the bitterness of the Squire, disappointed in all his hopes and\r\nin the pride of his heart; and then the young man saw compensations\r\nand heroisms in Gerald\'s case which were invisible to the unheroic\r\neyes of Mr Wentworth, who looked at it entirely from a practical point\r\nof view, and regarded with keen mortification an event which would lay\r\nall the affairs of the Wentworths open to general discussion, and\r\ninvite the eye of the world to a renewed examination of his domestic\r\nskeletons. Everything had been hushed and shut up in the Hall for at\r\nleast an hour, when the Squire got up at last and lighted his candle,\r\nand held out his hand to his son--"This isn\'t a very cheerful visit\r\nfor you, Frank," he said; "but we\'ll try again to-morrow, and have one\r\nother talk with Gerald. Couldn\'t you read up some books on the\r\nsubject, or think of something new to say to him? God bless my soul!\r\nif I were as young and as much accustomed to talking as you are, I\'d\r\nsurely find out some argument," said the Squire, with a momentary\r\nspark of temper, which made his son feel more comfortable about him.\r\n"It\'s your business to convince a man when he\'s wrong. We\'ll try\r\nGerald once more, and perhaps something may come of it; and as for\r\nJack--" Here the Squire paused, and shook his head, and let go his\r\nson\'s hand. "I suppose it\'s sitting up so late that makes one feel so\r\ncold and wretched, and as if one saw ghosts," said Mr Wentworth.\r\n"Don\'t stay here any longer, and take care of the candles. I ought to\r\nhave been in bed two hours ago. Good-night."\r\n\r\nAnd as he walked away, the Curate could not but observe what an aged\r\nfigure it looked, moving with a certain caution to the door. The great\r\nlibrary was so dim that the light of the candle which the Squire\r\ncarried in his hand was necessary to reveal his figure clearly, and\r\nthere was no mistaking his air of age and feebleness. The Curate\'s\r\nthoughts were not very agreeable when he was left by himself in the\r\nhalf-lighted room. His imagination jumped to a picture very possible,\r\nbut grievous to think of--Jack seated in his father\'s place, and "the\r\ngirls" and the little children turned out upon the world. In such a\r\ncase, who would be their protector and natural guardian? Not Gerald,\r\nwho was about to divest himself of ties still closer and more sacred.\r\nThe Curate lit his candle too, and went hastily to his room when that\r\nthought came upon him. There might be circumstances still more\r\nhopeless and appalling than the opposition of a rector or the want of\r\na benefice. He preferred to return to his anxiety about Gerald, and to\r\nput away that thought, as he went hurriedly up-stairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n\r\n"The sum of it all is, that you won\'t hear any reason, Gerald," said\r\nthe Squire. "What your brother says, and what I say, are nothing; your\r\npoor wife is nothing; and all a man\'s duties, sir, in life--all your\r\nresponsibilities, everything that is considered most sacred--"\r\n\r\n"You may say what you will to me, father," said Gerald. "I can\'t\r\nexpect you should speak differently. But you may imagine I have looked\r\nat it in every possible light before I came to this resolution. A man\r\ndoes not decide easily when everything he prizes on earth is at\r\nstake. I cannot see with Frank\'s eyes, or with yours; according to the\r\nlight God has given me, I must see with my own."\r\n\r\n"But, God bless my soul! what do you mean by seeing with your own eyes?"\r\nsaid the Squire. "Don\'t you know that is a Protestant doctrine, sir? Do\r\nyou think they\'ll let you see with any eyes but theirs when you get\r\namong a set of Papists? Instead of an easy-going bishop, and friendly\r\nfellows for brother clergymen, and parishioners that think everything\r\nthat\'s good of you, how do you suppose you\'ll feel as an Englishman when\r\nyou get into a dead Frenchified system, with everything going by rule\r\nand measure, and bound to believe just as you\'re told? It\'ll kill you,\r\nsir--that\'s what will be the end of it. If you are in your grave within\r\nthe year, it will be no wonder to me."\r\n\r\n"Amen!" said Gerald, softly. "If that is to be all, we will not\r\nquarrel with the result;" and he got up and went to the window, as if\r\nto look for his cedar, which was not there. Perhaps the absence of his\r\nsilent referee gave him a kind of comfort, though at the same time it\r\ndisappointed him in some fantastical way, for he turned with a curious\r\nlook of relief and vexation to his brother. "We need not be always\r\nthinking of it, even if this were to be the end," he said. "Come down\r\nthe avenue with me, Frank, and let us talk of something else. The\r\ngirls will grumble, but they can have you later: come, I want to hear\r\nabout yourself."\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the Squire got up when his sons did, which was by no means\r\ntheir intention; but Mr Wentworth was vexed and restless, and was not\r\nwilling to let Gerald off so easily. If he were mad, at least he ought\r\nto be made duly wretched in his madness, Mr Wentworth thought; and he\r\nwent out with them, and arrested the words on their lips. Somehow\r\neverything seemed to concur in hindering any appeal on the part of the\r\nCurate. And Gerald, like most imaginative men, had a power of dismissing\r\nhis troubles after they had taken their will of him. It was he who took\r\nthe conversation on himself when they went out of doors. Finding Frank\r\nslow in his report, Gerald went into all the country news for the\r\ninstruction of his brother. He had been down to the very depths during\r\nthe two previous days, and now he had come aloft again; for a man cannot\r\nbe miserable every moment of his life, however heavy his burden may be.\r\nThe "girls," whose anxieties had been much stimulated by the renewed\r\nconference held with closed doors in the library, stood watching them\r\nfrom one of the drawing-room windows. The boldest of the two had,\r\nindeed, got her hat to follow them, not comprehending why Frank should\r\nbe monopolised for days together by anybody but herself, his favourite\r\nsister; but something in the aspect of the three men, when they first\r\nappeared under the lime-trees, had awed even the lively Letty out of her\r\nusual courage. "But Gerald is talking and laughing just as usual," she\r\nsaid, as she stood at the window dangling her hat in her hand--"more\r\nthan usual, for he has been very glum all this spring. Poor fellow! I\r\ndaresay Louisa worries him out of his life;" and with this easy\r\nconclusion the elder brother was dismissed by the girls. "Perhaps Frank\r\nis going to be married," said the other sister, who, under the lively\r\nspur of this idea, came back to the window to gaze at him again, and\r\nfind out whether any intimation of this alarming possibility could be\r\ngathered from the fit of his long clerical coat, or his manner of walk,\r\nas he sauntered along under the limes. "As if a Perpetual Curate could\r\nmarry!" said Letty, with scorn, who knew the world. As for little Janet,\r\nwho was a tender-hearted little soul, she folded her two hands together,\r\nand looked at her brother\'s back with a great increase of interest. "If\r\none loved him, one would not mind what he was," said the little maiden,\r\nwho had been in some trouble herself, and understood about such matters.\r\nSo the girls talked at their window, Mrs Wentworth being, as usual,\r\noccupied with her nursery, and nobody else at hand to teach them wisdom,\r\nand soon branched off into speculations about the post-bag, which was\r\n"due," and which, perhaps, was almost more interesting, to one of them\r\nat least, than even a brother who was going to be married.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time Gerald was talking of Huxtable and Plumstead, the\r\nbrother-in-law and cousin, who were both clergymen in the same\r\ndistrict, and about the people in the village whom they had known when\r\nthey were boys, and who never grew any older. "There is old Kilweed,\r\nfor example, who was Methuselah in those days--he\'s not eighty yet,"\r\nhe said, with a smile and a sigh; "it is we who grow older and come\r\nnearer to the winter and the sunset. My father even has come down a\r\nlong way off the awful eminence on which I used to behold him: every\r\nyear that falls on my head seems to take one off his: if we both live\r\nlong enough, we shall feel like contemporaries by-and-by," said\r\nGerald: "just now the advantage of years is all on my side; and you\r\nare my junior, sir." He was switching down the weeds among the grass\r\nwith his cane as he spoke, like any schoolboy; the air, and perhaps a\r\nlittle excitement, had roused the blood to his cheek. He did not look\r\nthe same man as the pale martyr in the library--not that he had any\r\nreason for appearing different, but only that inalienable poetic\r\nwaywardness which kept him up through his trouble. As for Mr\r\nWentworth, he resented the momentary brightening, which he took for\r\nlevity.\r\n\r\n"I thought we came out here to prolong our discussion," said the\r\nSquire. "I don\'t understand this light way of talking. If you mean\r\nwhat you have said, sir, I should never expect to see you smile more."\r\n\r\n"The smiling makes little difference," said Gerald; but he stopped\r\nshort in his talk, and there was a pause among them till the postboy\r\ncame up to them with his bag, which Mr Wentworth, with much\r\nimportance, paused to open. The young men, who had no special interest\r\nin its contents, went on. Perhaps the absence of their father was a\r\nrelief to them. They were nearer to each other, understood each other\r\nbetter than he could do; and they quickened their pace insensibly as\r\nthey began to talk. It is easy to imagine what kind of talk it\r\nwas--entire sympathy, yet disagreement wide as the poles--here for a\r\nfew steps side by side, there darting off at the most opposite\r\ntangent; but they had begun to warm to it, and to forget everything\r\nelse, when a succession of lusty hollos from the Squire brought them\r\nsuddenly to themselves, and to a dead stop. When they looked round, he\r\nwas making up to them with choleric strides. "What the deuce do you\r\nmean, sir, by having telegrams sent here?" cried Mr Wentworth,\r\npitching at his son Frank an ominous ugly envelope, in blue and red,\r\nsuch as the unsophisticated mind naturally trembles at. "Beg your\r\npardon, Gerald; but I never can keep my temper when I see a telegraph.\r\nI daresay it\'s something about Charley," said the old man, in a\r\nslightly husky voice--"to make up to us for inventing troubles." The\r\nSquire was a good deal disturbed by the sight of that ill-omened\r\nmessage; and it was the better way, as he knew by experience, to throw\r\nhis excitement into the shape of anger rather than that of grief.\r\n\r\n"It\'s nothing about Charley," said Frank; and Mr Wentworth blew his\r\nnose violently and drew a long breath. "I don\'t understand it," said\r\nthe Curate, who looked scared and pale; "it seems to be from Jack;\r\nthough why _he_ is in Carlingford, or what he has to do--"\r\n\r\n"He\'s ill, sir, I suppose--dying; nothing else was to be looked for,"\r\nsaid the Squire, and held out his hand, which trembled, for the\r\ntelegram. "Stuff! why shouldn\'t I be able to bear it? Has he been any\r\ncomfort to me? Can\'t you read it, one of you?" cried the old man.\r\n\r\n"\'John Wentworth to the Reverend--\'"\r\n\r\n"God bless my soul! can\'t you come to what he says?"\r\n\r\n"\'Come back directly--you are wanted here; I am in trouble, as usual;\r\nand T.W.--\'"\r\n\r\nHere the Squire took a step backwards, and set himself against a tree.\r\n"The sun comes in one\'s eyes," he said, rather feebly. "There\'s\r\nsomething poisonous in the air today. Here\'s Gerald going out of the\r\nChurch; and here\'s Frank in Jack\'s secrets. God forgive him! Lads, it\r\nseems you think I\'ve had enough of this world\'s good. My heir\'s a\r\nswindling villain, and you know it; and here\'s Frank going the same\r\nroad too."\r\n\r\nThe Squire did not hear the words that both the brothers addressed to\r\nhim; he was unconscious of the Curate\'s disclaimer and eager explanation\r\nthat he knew nothing about Jack, and could not understand his presence\r\nin Carlingford. The blow he had got the previous day had confused his\r\nbrain outside, and these accumulated vexations had bewildered it within.\r\n"And I could have sworn by Frank!" said the old man, piteously, to\r\nhimself, as he put up his hand unawares and tugged at the dainty\r\nstarched cravat which was his pride. If they had not held him in their\r\narms, he would have slid down at the foot of the tree, against which he\r\nhad instinctively propped himself. The attack was less alarming to\r\nGerald, who had seen it before, than to Frank, who had only heard of it;\r\nbut the postboy was still within call, by good fortune, and was sent off\r\nfor assistance. They carried him to the Hall, gasping for breath, and in\r\na state of partial unconsciousness, but still feebly repeating those\r\nwords which went to the Curate\'s heart--"I could have sworn by Frank!"\r\nThe house was in a great fright and tumult, naturally, before they\r\nreached it, Mrs Wentworth fainting, the girls looking on in dismay, and\r\nthe whole household moved to awe and alarm, knowing that one time or\r\nother Death would come so. As for the Curate of St Roque\'s, he had\r\nalready made up his mind, with unexpected anguish, not only that his\r\nfather was dying, but that his father would die under a fatal\r\nmisconception about himself; and between this overwhelming thought, and\r\nthe anxiety which nobody understood or could sympathise with respecting\r\nJack\'s message, the young man was almost beside himself. He went away in\r\nutter despair from the anxious consultations of the family after the\r\ndoctor had come, and kept walking up and down before the house, waiting\r\nto hear the worst, as he thought; but yet unable, even while his father\r\nlay dying, to keep from thinking what miserable chance, what folly or\r\ncrime, had taken Jack to Carlingford, and what his brother could have to\r\ndo with the owner of the initials named in his telegram. He was lost in\r\nthis twofold trouble when Gerald came out to him with brightened looks.\r\n\r\n"He is coming round, and the doctor says there is no immediate\r\ndanger," said Gerald; "and it is only immediate danger one is afraid\r\nof. He was as well as ever last time in a day or two. It is the\r\ncomplaint of the Wentworths, you know--we all die of it; but, Frank,\r\ntell me what is this about Jack?"\r\n\r\n"I know no more than you do," said the Curate, when he had recovered\r\nhimself a little. "I must go back, not having done much good here, to\r\nsee."\r\n\r\n"And T.W.?" said Gerald. The elder brother looked at the younger\r\nsuspiciously, as if he were afraid for him; and it was scarcely in\r\nhuman nature not to feel a momentary flash of resentment.\r\n\r\n"I tell you I know nothing about it," said Frank, "except what is\r\nevident to any one, that Jack has gone to Carlingford in my absence,\r\nbeing in trouble somehow. I suppose he always is in trouble. I have not\r\nheard from him since I went there; but as it don\'t seem I can be of any\r\nuse here, as soon as my father is safe, I will go back. Louisa imagined,\r\nyou know--; but she was wrong."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Gerald, quietly. That subject was concluded, and there was\r\nno more to say.\r\n\r\nThe same evening, as the Squire continued to improve, and had been able\r\nto understand his energetic explanation that he was entirely ignorant of\r\nJack\'s secrets, Frank Wentworth went back again with a very disturbed\r\nmind. He went into the Rectory as he passed down to the station, to say\r\ngood-bye to Louisa, who was sitting in the drawing-room with her\r\nchildren round her, and her trouble considerably lightened, though there\r\nwas no particular cause for it. Dressing for dinner had of itself a\r\nbeneficial effect upon Louisa: she could not understand how a life could\r\never be changed which was so clearly ordained of Heaven; for if Gerald\r\nwas not with her, what inducement could she possibly have to dress for\r\ndinner? and then what would be the good of all the pretty wardrobe with\r\nwhich Providence had endowed her? Must not Providence take care that its\r\ngifts were not thus wasted? So the world was once more set fast on its\r\nfoundations, and the pillars of earth remained unshaken, when Frank\r\nglanced in on his way to the station to say good-bye.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be afraid, Louisa; I don\'t believe he would be allowed to do it,"\r\nsaid the Curate in her ear. "The Church of Rome does not go in the face\r\nof nature. She will not take him away from you. Keep your heart at ease\r\nas much as you can. Good-bye."\r\n\r\n"You mean about Gerald. Oh, you don\'t _really_ think he could ever\r\nhave had the heart?" said Mrs Wentworth. "I am so sorry you are going\r\naway without any dinner or anything comfortable; and it was so good of\r\nyou to come, and I feel so much better. I shall always be grateful to\r\nyou, dear Frank, for showing Gerald his mistake; and tell dear aunt\r\nDora I am so much obliged to her for thinking of the blanket for the\r\nbassinet. I am sure it will be lovely. Must you go? Good-bye. I am\r\nsure you have always been like my own brother--Frank, dear, good-bye.\r\nCome and kiss your dear uncle, children, and say good-bye."\r\n\r\nThis was how Louisa dismissed him after all his efforts on her behalf.\r\nThe girls were waiting for him on the road, still full of anxiety to\r\nknow why he had come so suddenly, and was going away so soon. "We have\r\nnot had half a peep of you," said Letty; "and it is wicked of you not\r\nto tell us; as if anybody could sympathise like your sisters--your\r\nvery own sisters, Frank," said the young lady, with a pressure on his\r\narm. In such a mixed family the words meant something.\r\n\r\n"We had made up our minds you had come to tell papa," said Janet,\r\nwith her pretty shy look; "that was my guess--you might tell us her\r\nname, Frank."\r\n\r\n"Whose name?" said the unfortunate Curate; and the dazzling vision of\r\nLucy Wodehouse\'s face, which came upon him at the moment, was such,\r\nthat the reluctant blood rose high in his cheeks--which, of course,\r\nthe girls were quick enough to perceive.\r\n\r\n"It _is_ about some girl, after all," said Letty; "oh me! I did not\r\nthink you had been like all the rest. I thought you had other things\r\nto think of. Janet may say what she likes--but I do think it\'s\r\ncontemptible always to find out, when a man, who can do lots of\r\nthings, is in trouble, that it\'s about some girl or other like one\'s\r\nself! I did not expect it of you, Frank--but all the same, tell us who\r\nshe is?" said the favourite sister, clasping his arm confidentially,\r\nand dropping her voice.\r\n\r\n"There is the train. Good-bye, girls, and be sure you write to me\r\nto-morrow how my father is," said the Curate. He had taken his seat\r\nbefore they could ask further questions, and in a minute or two more\r\nwas dashing out of the little station, catching their smiles and\r\nadieus as he went, and turning back last of all for another look at\r\nGerald, who stood leaning on his stick, looking after the train, with\r\nthe mist of preoccupation gathering again over his smiling eyes. The\r\nCurate went back to his corner after that, and lost himself in\r\nthoughts and anxieties still more painful. What had Jack to do in\r\nCarlingford? what connection had he with those initials, or how did he\r\nknow their owner? All sorts of horrible fears came over the Curate of\r\nSt Roque\'s. He had not seen his elder brother for years, and Jack\'s\r\ncareer was not one for the family to be proud of. Had he done\r\nsomething too terrible to be hidden--too clamorous to let his name\r\ndrop out of remembrance, as was to be desired for the credit of the\r\nWentworths? This speculation whiled the night away but drearily, as the\r\nPerpetual Curate went back to the unknown tide of cares which had\r\nsurged in his absence into his momentarily abandoned place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Wentworth got back to Carlingford by a happy concurrence of trains\r\nbefore the town had gone to sleep. It was summer, when the days are at\r\nthe longest, and the twilight was just falling into night as he took\r\nhis way through George Street. He went along the familiar street with\r\na certain terror of looking into people\'s faces whom he met, and of\r\nasking questions, such as was natural to a man who did not know\r\nwhether something of public note might not have happened in his\r\nabsence to call attention to his name. He imagined, indeed, that he\r\ndid see a strange expression in the looks of the townsfolk he\r\nencountered on his way. He thought they looked at him askance as they\r\nmade their salutations, and said something to each other after they\r\npassed, which, indeed, in several cases was true enough, though the\r\ncause was totally different from anything suspected by Mr Wentworth.\r\nAnxious to know, and yet unwilling to ask, it was with a certain\r\nrelief that the Curate saw the light gleaming out from the open door\r\nof Elsworthy\'s shop as he approached. He went in and tossed down his\r\ntravelling-bag on the counter, and threw himself on the solitary chair\r\nwhich stood outside for the accommodation of customers, with a\r\nsuppressed excitement, which made his question sound abrupt and\r\nsignificant to the ears of Elsworthy. "Has anything happened since I\r\nwent away?" said Mr Wentworth, throwing a glance round the shop which\r\nalarmed his faithful retainer. Somehow, though nothing was farther\r\nfrom his mind than little Rosa, or any thought of her, the Curate\r\nmissed the pretty little figure at the first glance.\r\n\r\n"Well--no, sir; not much as I\'ve heard of," said Elsworthy, with a\r\nlittle confusion. He was tying up his newspapers as usual, but it did\r\nnot require the touch of suspicion and anxiety which gave sharpness to\r\nthe Curate\'s eyes to make it apparent that the cord was trembling in\r\nMr Elsworthy\'s hand. "I hope you\'ve had a pleasant journey, sir, and a\r\ncomfortable visit--it\'s been but short--but we always miss you in\r\nCarlingford, Mr Wentworth, if it was only for a day."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll take my paper," said the young man, who was not satisfied--"so\r\nthere\'s no news, isn\'t there?--all well, and everything going on as\r\nusual?" And the look which the suspicious Curate bent upon Mr\r\nElsworthy made that virtuous individual, as he himself described it,\r\n"shake in his shoes."\r\n\r\n"Much as usual, sir," said the frightened clerk,--"nothing new as I\r\nhear of but gossip, and that aint a thing to interest a clergyman.\r\nThere\'s always one report or another flying about, but them follies\r\naint for your hearing. Nothing more," continued Mr Elsworthy,\r\nconscious of guilt, and presenting a very tremulous countenance to the\r\ninspection of his suspicious auditor, "not if it was my last\r\nword--nothing but gossip, as you wouldn\'t care to hear."\r\n\r\n"I might possibly care to hear if it concerned myself," said the\r\nCurate,--"or anybody I am interested in," he added, after a little\r\npause, with rather a forced smile--which convinced Mr Elsworthy that\r\nhis clergyman had heard all about Rosa, and that the days of his\r\nincumbency as clerk of St Roque\'s were numbered.\r\n\r\n"Well, sir, if you did hear, it aint no blame of mine," said the\r\ninjured bookseller; "such a notion would never have come into my\r\nmind--no man, I make bold to say, is more particular about keeping to\r\nhis own rank of life nor me. What you did, sir, you did out of the\r\nkindness of your heart, and I\'d sooner sell up and go off to the end\r\nof the world than impose upon a gentleman. Her aunt\'s took her away,"\r\ncontinued Mr Elsworthy, lowering his voice, and cautiously pointing\r\nto the back of the shop--"She\'ll not bother you no more."\r\n\r\n"She!--who?" cried the Perpetual Curate, in sudden consternation. He\r\nwas utterly bewildered by the introduction of a female actor into the\r\nlittle drama, and immediately ran over in his mind all the women he\r\ncould think of who could, by any possibility, be involved in\r\nmysterious relations with his brother Jack.\r\n\r\n"She\'s but a child," said Elsworthy, pathetically; "she don\'t know\r\nnothing about the ways o\' the world. If she was a bit proud o\' being\r\nnoticed, there wasn\'t no harm in that. But seeing as there\'s nothing\r\nin this world that folks won\'t make a talk of when they\'ve started,\r\nher aunt, as is very partic\'lar, has took her away. Not as I\'m meaning\r\nno reproach to you, Mr Wentworth; but she\'s a loss to us, is Rosa. She\r\nwas a cheerful little thing, say the worst of her," said Mr Elsworthy;\r\n"going a-singing and a-chirping out and in the shop; and I won\'t deny\r\nas the place looks desolate, now she\'s away. But that aint neither\r\nhere nor there. It was for her good, as my missis says. Most things as\r\nis unpleasant _is_ sent for good, they tell me; and I wouldn\'t--not\r\nfor any comfort to myself--have a talk got up about the clergyman--"\r\n\r\nBy this time Mr Wentworth had awakened to a sense of the real meaning of\r\nElsworthy\'s talk. He sat upright on his chair, and looked into the face\r\nof the worthy shopkeeper until the poor man trembled. "A talk about the\r\nclergyman?" said the Curate. "About me, do you mean? and what has little\r\nRosa to do with me? Have you gone crazy in Carlingford--what is the\r\nmeaning of it all?" He sat with his elbows on the counter, looking at\r\nhis trembling adherent--looking through and through him, as Elsworthy\r\nsaid. "I should be glad of an explanation; what does it mean?" said Mr\r\nWentworth, with a look which there was no evading; and the clerk of St\r\nRoque\'s cast an anxious glance round him for help. He would have\r\naccepted it from any quarter at that overwhelming moment; but there was\r\nnot even an errand-boy to divert from him the Curate\'s terrible eyes.\r\n\r\n"I--I don\'t know--I--can\'t tell how it got up," said the unhappy man,\r\nwho had not even his "missis" in the parlour as a moral support. "One\r\nthing as I know is, it wasn\'t no blame o\' mine. I as good as went down\r\non my knees to them three respected ladies when they come to inquire. I\r\nsaid as it was kindness in you a-seeing of the child home, and didn\'t\r\nmean nothing more. I ask you, sir, what could I do?" cried Mr Elsworthy.\r\n"Folks in Carlingford will talk o\' two straws if they\'re a-seen\r\na-blowing up Grange Lane on the same breath o\' wind. I couldn\'t do no\r\nmore nor contradict it," cried Rosa\'s guardian, getting excited in his\r\nself-defence; "and to save your feelings, Mr Wentworth, and put it out\r\no\' folks\'s power to talk, the missis has been and took her away."\r\n\r\n"To save my feelings!" said the Curate, with a laugh of contempt and\r\nvexation and impatience which it was not pleasant to hear. At another\r\nmoment an accusation so ridiculous would have troubled him very little;\r\nbut just now, with a sudden gleam of insight, he saw all the\r\ncomplications which might spring out of it to confuse further the path\r\nwhich he already felt to be so burdened. "I\'ll tell you what,\r\nElsworthy," said Mr Wentworth; "if you don\'t want to make me your enemy\r\ninstead of your friend, you\'ll send for this child instantly, without a\r\nday\'s delay. Tell your wife that my orders are that she should come back\r\ndirectly. _My_ feelings! do the people in Carlingford think me an idiot,\r\nI wonder?" said the Curate, walking up and down to relieve his mind.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, sir, I\'m sure," said Elsworthy, who thought some answer\r\nwas required of him. To tell the truth, Rosa\'s uncle felt a little\r\nspiteful. He did not see matters in exactly the same light as Mr\r\nWentworth did. At the bottom of his heart, after all, lay a thrill of\r\nawakened ambition. Kings and princes had been known to marry far out\r\nof their degree for the sake of a beautiful face; and why a Perpetual\r\nCurate should be so much more lofty in his sentiments, puzzled and\r\nirritated the clerk of St Roque\'s. "There aint a worm but will turn\r\nwhen he\'s trod upon," said Mr Elsworthy to himself; and when his\r\ntemper was roused, he became impertinent, according to the manner of\r\nhis kind.\r\n\r\nMr Wentworth gave him a quick look, struck by the changed tone, but\r\nunable to make out whether it might not be stupidity. "You understand\r\nwhat I mean, Elsworthy," he said, with his loftiest air. "If Rosa does\r\nnot return instantly, I shall be seriously offended. How you and your\r\nfriends could be such utter idiots as to get up this ridiculous\r\nfiction, I can\'t conceive; but the sooner it\'s over the better. I\r\nexpect to see her back to-morrow," said the Curate, taking up his bag\r\nand looking with an absolute despotism, which exasperated the man, in\r\nElsworthy\'s face.\r\n\r\n"You may be sure, sir, if she knows as you want to see her, she\'ll\r\ncome," said the worm which had been trampled on; "and them as asks me\r\nwhy, am I to say it was the clergyman\'s orders?" said Elsworthy,\r\nlooking up in his turn with a consciousness of power. "That means a\r\ndeal, does that. I wouldn\'t take it upon me to say as much, not of\r\nmyself; but if them\'s your orders, Mr Wentworth--"\r\n\r\n"It appears to me, Elsworthy," said the Curate, who was inwardly in a\r\ntowering passion, though outwardly calm enough, "either that you\'ve\r\nbeen drinking or that you mean to be impertinent--which is it?"\r\n\r\n"Me!--drinking, sir?" cried the shopkeeper. "If I had been one as was\r\ngiven that way, I wouldn\'t have attended to your interests not as I\r\nhave done. There aint another man in Carlingford as has stood up for\r\nhis clergyman as I have; and as for little Rosa, sir, most folks as\r\nhad right notions would have inquired into that; but being as I\r\ntrusted in you, I wasn\'t the one to make any talk. I\'ve said to\r\neverybody as has asked me that there wasn\'t nothing in it but\r\nkindness. I don\'t say as I hadn\'t my own thoughts--for gentlemen don\'t\r\ngo walking up Grange Lane with a pretty little creature like that all\r\nfor nothing; but instead o\' making anything of that, or leading of you\r\non, or putting it in the child\'s head to give you encouragement, what\r\nwas it I did but send her away afore you came home, that you mightn\'t\r\nbe led into temptation! And instead of feelin\' grateful, you say I\'ve\r\nbeen drinking! It\'s a thing as I scorn to answer," said Mr Elsworthy;\r\n"there aint no need to make any reply--all Carlingford knows _me_; but\r\nas for Rosa, if it is understood plain between us that it\'s your wish,\r\nI aint the man to interfere," continued Rosa\'s guardian, with a smile\r\nwhich drove the Curate frantic; "but she hasn\'t got no father, poor\r\nthing, and it\'s my business to look after her; and I\'ll not bring her\r\nback, Mr Wentworth, unless it\'s understood between us plain."\r\n\r\nStrong language, forcible, but unclerical, was on the Curate\'s lips,\r\nand it was only with an effort that he restrained himself. "Look here,\r\nElsworthy," he said; "it will be better for you not to exasperate me.\r\nYou understand perfectly what I mean. I repeat, Rosa must come back,\r\nand that instantly. It is quite unnecessary to explain to you why I\r\ninsist upon this, for you comprehend it. Pshaw! don\'t let us have any\r\nmore of this absurdity," he exclaimed, impatiently. "No more, I tell\r\nyou. Your wife is not such a fool. Let anybody who inquires about me\r\nunderstand that I have come back, and am quite able to account for all\r\nmy actions," said the Curate, shouldering his bag. He was just about\r\nleaving the shop when Elsworthy rushed after him in an access of alarm\r\nand repentance.\r\n\r\n"One moment, sir," cried the shopkeeper; "there aint no offence, Mr\r\nWentworth? I am sure there aint nobody in Carlingford as means better,\r\nor would do as much for his clergyman. One moment, sir; there was one\r\nthing I forgot to mention. Mr Wodehouse, sir, has been took bad. There\r\nwas a message up a couple of hours ago to know when you was expected\r\nhome. He\'s had a stroke, and they don\'t think as he\'ll get over\r\nit--being a man of a full \'abit of body," said Mr Elsworthy in haste,\r\nlest the Curate should break in on his unfinished speech, "makes it\r\ndangerous. I\'ve had my fears this long time past."\r\n\r\n"A stroke," said the Curate--"a fit, do you mean? When, and how? and,\r\ngood heavens! to think that you have been wasting my time with\r\nrubbish, and knew this!" Mr Wentworth tossed down his travelling-bag\r\nagain, and wiped his forehead nervously. He had forgotten his real\r\nanxiety in the irritation of the moment. Now it returned upon him with\r\ndouble force. "How did it come on?" he asked, "and when?" and stood\r\nwaiting for the answer, with a world of other questions, which he\r\ncould not put to Elsworthy, hanging on his lips.\r\n\r\n"I have a deal of respect for that family, sir," said Elsworthy; "they\r\nhave had troubles as few folks in Carlingford know of. How close they\r\nhave kep\' things, to be sure!--but not so close as them that has good\r\nmemories, and can put two and two together, couldn\'t call to mind. My\r\nopinion, sir, if you believe me," said the clerk of St Roque\'s,\r\napproaching close to the Curate\'s ear, "is, that it\'s something\r\nconcerning the son."\r\n\r\n"The son!" said Mr Wentworth, with a troubled look. Then, after a\r\npause, he added, as if his exclamation had been an oversight, "What\r\nson? has Mr Wodehouse a son?"\r\n\r\n"To think as they should have been so close with the clergyman!" said\r\nElsworthy, innocently; "though he aint no credit that they should talk\r\nof him. He\'s been gone out o\' Carlingford nigh upon twenty year; but\r\nhe aint dead for all that; and I\'m told as he\'s been seen about Grange\r\nLane this last spring. I am one as hears all the talk that\'s a-going\r\non, being, as you might say, in a public position of life. Such a\r\nthing mightn\'t maybe come to your ears, sir?" he continued, looking\r\ninquisitively in Mr Wentworth\'s face; "but wherever he is, you may be\r\nsure it\'s something about him as has brought on this attack on the old\r\nman. It was last night as he was took so bad, and a couple of hours\r\nago a message came up. Miss Wodehouse (as is the nicest lady in\r\nGrange Lane, and a great friend to me) had took a panic, and she was\r\na-crying for you, the man said, and wouldn\'t take no denial. If I had\r\nknown where you was to be found, I\'d have sent word."\r\n\r\n"Send down my bag to my house," said the Curate, hastily interrupting\r\nhim. "Good-night--don\'t forget what I said about the other matter." Mr\r\nWentworth went out of the shop with a disagreeable impression that\r\nElsworthy had been examining his face like an inquisitor, and was\r\nalready forming conclusions from what he had seen there. He went away\r\nhurriedly, with a great many vague fears in his mind. Mr Wodehouse\'s\r\nsudden illness seemed to him a kind of repetition and echo of the\r\nSquire\'s, and in the troubled and uncertain state of his thoughts, he\r\ngot to confusing them together in the centre of this whirl of unknown\r\ndisaster and perplexity. Perhaps even thus it was not all bitterness to\r\nthe young man to feel his family united with that of Lucy Wodehouse. He\r\nwent down Grange Lane in the summer darkness under the faint stars, full\r\nof anxiety and alarm, yet not without a thrill in his heart, a sweeter\r\nunder-current of conscious agitation in the knowledge that he was\r\nhastening to her presence. Sudden breaks in his thoughts revealed her,\r\nas if behind a curtain, rising to receive him, giving him her hand,\r\nmeeting his look with a smile; so that, on the whole, neither Gerald\'s\r\ndistress, nor Jack\'s alarming call, nor his father\'s attack, nor Mr\r\nWodehouse\'s illness, nor the general atmosphere of vexation and trouble\r\nsurrounding his way, could succeed in making the young man totally\r\nwretched. He had this little stronghold of his own to retire into. The\r\nworld could not fall to pieces so long as he continued with eager steps\r\nto devour the road which led to Mr Wodehouse\'s garden-door.\r\n\r\nBefore he had reached that goal, however, he met a group who were\r\nevidently returning from some little dinner in Grange Lane. Mr Wentworth\r\ntook off his hat hastily in recognition of Mrs Morgan, who was walking\r\nby her husband\'s side, with a bright-coloured hood over her head\r\ninstead of a bonnet. The Curate, who was a man of taste, could not help\r\nobserving, even in the darkness, and amid all his preoccupations, how\r\nutterly the cherry-coloured trimmings of her head-dress were out of\r\naccordance with the serious countenance of the Rector\'s wife, who was a\r\nlittle heated with her walk. She was a good woman, but she was not fair\r\nto look upon; and it occurred to Mr Wentworth to wonder, if Lucy were to\r\nwait ten years for him, would the youthful grace dry and wither out of\r\nher like this! And then all at once another idea flashed upon his mind,\r\nwithout any wish of his. Like the unhappy lover in the ballad, he was\r\nsuddenly aware of a temptation--\r\n\r\n"How there looked him in the face An angel beautiful and bright, And how\r\nhe knew it was a fiend."\r\n\r\n"Of course the Rectory will go to Frank." He could not tell why at that\r\nmoment the words rang into his ear with such a penetrating sound. That\r\nhe hated himself for being able to think of such a possibility made no\r\ndifference. It came darting and tingling into his mind like one of those\r\nsuggestions of blasphemy which the devils whispered in Christian\'s ear\r\nas he went through the Valley of the Shadow of Death. He went on faster\r\nthan ever to escape from it, scarcely observing that Mrs Morgan, instead\r\nof simply acknowledging his bow as she passed, stopped to shake hands,\r\nand to say how glad she was he had come back again. He thought of it\r\nafterwards with wonder and a strange gratitude. The Rector\'s wife was\r\nnot like the conventional type of a pitying angel; and even had she been\r\nso, he had not time to recognise her at that moment as he went\r\nstruggling with his demons to Mr Wodehouse\'s green door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the green door was opened, Mr Wentworth saw at a glance that\r\nthere was agitation and trouble in the house. Lights were twinkling\r\nirregularly in the windows here and there, but the family apartment,\r\nthe cheerful drawing-room, which generally threw its steady, cheerful\r\nblaze over the dark garden, shone but faintly with half-extinguished\r\nlights and undrawn curtains. It was evident at a glance that the room\r\nwas deserted, and its usual occupants engaged elsewhere. "Master\'s\r\nvery bad, sir," said the servant who opened the door; "the young\r\nladies is both with him, and a hired nurse come in besides. The doctor\r\ndon\'t seem to have no great hopes, but it will be a comfort to know as\r\nyou have come back. Miss Wodehouse wanted you very bad an hour or two\r\nago, for they thought as master was reviving, and could understand.\r\nI\'ll go and let them know you are here."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t disturb them, unless I can be of use," said Mr Wentworth. The\r\nlook of the house, and the atmosphere of distress and anxiety about\r\nit, chilled him suddenly. His visions and hopes seemed guilty and\r\nselfish as he went slowly up those familiar steps and into the house,\r\nover which the shadow of death seemed already lying. He went by\r\nhimself into the forsaken drawing-room, where two neglected candles\r\nwere burning feebly in a corner, and the wistful sky looking in as if\r\nto ask why the domestic temple was thus left open and uncared for.\r\nAfter the first moment he went hastily to the windows, and drew down\r\nthe blinds in a kind of tender impatience. He could not bear that\r\nanything in the world, even her father\'s danger, should discompose the\r\nsweet, good order of the place where Lucy\'s image dwelt. There was a\r\nchair and her basket of work, and on the little table a book marked\r\nwith pencil-marks, such as youthful readers love to make; and by\r\ndegrees that breath of Lucy lingering in the silent room overcame its\r\ndreariness, and the painful sense of desertion which had struck him at\r\nfirst. He hovered about that corner where her usual place was, feeling\r\nin his heart that Lucy in trouble was dearer, if possible, than Lucy\r\nin happiness, and hung over her chair, with a mixture of reverence and\r\ntenderness and yearning, which could never be expressed in words. It\r\nwas the divinest phase of love which was in his mind at the moment;\r\nfor he was not thinking of himself, but of her, and of how he could\r\nsuccour and comfort her, and interpose his own true heart and life\r\nbetween her and all trouble. It was at this moment that Lucy herself\r\nentered the room; she came in softly, and surprised him in the\r\noverflowing of his heart. She held out her hand to him as usual, and\r\nsmiled, perhaps less brightly, but that of course arose from the\r\ncircumstances of the house; and her voice was very measured and steady\r\nwhen she spoke, less variable than of old. What was it she said? Mr\r\nWentworth unconsciously left the neighbourhood of that chair over\r\nwhich he had been bending, which, to tell the truth, he had leaned his\r\nhead upon, lover-like, and perhaps even kissed for her sake, five\r\nminutes before, and grew red and grew pale with a strange revulsion\r\nand tumult of feeling. He could not tell what the difference was, or\r\nwhat it meant. He only felt in an instant, with a sense of the change\r\nthat chilled him to the heart, as if somehow a wall of ice had risen\r\nbetween them. He could see her through the transparent veil, and hear\r\nher speak, and perceive the smile which cast no warmth of reflection\r\non him; but in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, everything in\r\nheaven and earth was changed. Lucy herself, to her own consciousness,\r\ntrembled and faltered, and felt as if her voice and her looks must\r\nbetray an amount of emotion which she would have died rather than\r\nshow; but then Lucy had rehearsed this scene before, and knew all she\r\nintended by it; whereas upon the Curate, in his little flush and\r\noverflow of tenderness, it fell like a sudden earthquake, rending his\r\nfair edifice of happiness asunder, and casting him out into unexpected\r\ndarkness. Sudden confusion, mortification, even a sense of injury and\r\nbitterness, came swelling over his heart as he set a chair for her as\r\nfar away as possible from the corner in which he had been indulging\r\nsuch vain and unwarrantable dreams.\r\n\r\n"It happened yesterday," said Lucy; "we have not been quite able to\r\nmake out what was the cause; at least _I_ have not been able to find\r\nit out. The clerks at the office say it was something about--but that\r\ndoes not matter," she went on, with her sweet politeness: "you don\'t\r\ncare for the details. I sometimes fancy Mary knows more than she tells\r\nme, and I think you are in her confidence, Mr Wentworth. But I am not\r\ngoing to ask you any questions. The doctors say he is not suffering so\r\nmuch as he seems to be. It is terrible to see him lie there not\r\nknowing any of us," said Lucy, with a tremble in her voice.\r\n\r\n"But you thought him better some time ago?" said the Curate, whose\r\nwords choked him, and who could not endure to speak.\r\n\r\n"Yes, about six o\'clock," said Lucy, "he tried to speak, and put Mary\r\nin a great fright, I cannot tell why. Would you be good enough, Mr\r\nWentworth," she went on hastily, with a strange mixture of earnestness\r\nand coldness, "if you know of anything she is keeping secret, to bid\r\nher tell me? I am able to bear anything there may be to bear--surely\r\nas well as she is, who has had no trouble," said Lucy, softly; and for\r\na moment she wavered in her fixed composure, and the wall of ice moved\r\nas if it might fall.\r\n\r\n"Nor you?" said the Curate, bending anxiously forward to look into her\r\neyes. He was inexpressibly moved and agitated by the inference, which\r\nperhaps no listener less intensely concerned would have drawn from\r\nwhat Lucy said. He could not bear that she should have any trouble\r\nwhich he might not do something to relieve her of.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, nor I," said Lucy, quickly, and in that moment the softening\r\nof tone disappeared entirely. "Mary will be pleased to see you, Mr\r\nWentworth. I will go and relieve her presently. Papa is asleep just\r\nnow, and I was down-stairs giving some directions when you came in. I\r\nwanted to ask you to look after that poor woman at No. 10. She still\r\nkeeps living on, and I have not been able to see her today. She misses\r\nme when I don\'t go," said Lucy, with a very little unconscious sigh.\r\n"Would you see her, please, to-morrow, if you have time?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, certainly," said the Curate; and then there was a pause. "Is\r\nthere nothing but this that you will let me do for you?" he asked,\r\ntrusting to his looks to show the heart, which at this moment he was\r\nso much tempted to disclose to her, but dared not. And even in all her\r\ntrouble Lucy was too much of a woman to neglect an opportunity so\r\ntempting.\r\n\r\n"Thank you," she said. "Yes, there are those poor little Bertrams I\r\nwas to have seen today--if you would be so very good as to send some\r\none to them." Lucy lifted her eyes only as she ended this little\r\nspeech. She had meant it cruelly, to be sure, and the arrow had gone\r\nhome; but when she met the look that was fixed on her after her little\r\nshaft was fired, Lucy\'s resolution faltered. The tears came rushing to\r\nher eyes so hot and rapid that she could not restrain them. Some\r\ntrouble of her own gave poignancy to that outbreak of filial grief.\r\n"Papa is so very ill!" she said, with a sob, as a scalding drop fell\r\nupon her hand; and then got up suddenly, afraid of the consequences.\r\nBut the Curate, mortified, wounded, and disheartened as he was, had no\r\ncomprehension either of the bitterness or the relenting that was in\r\nLucy\'s thoughts. Rosa Elsworthy did not so much as occur to him in all\r\nhis confused wonderings. He went after her to the door, too much\r\nperplexed and distressed to be indignant, as his first impulse was.\r\nShe turned half round, with a tremulous little inclination of her\r\nhead, which was all the good-night she could venture on. But the young\r\nman was too much disturbed to permit this.\r\n\r\n"You will give me your hand, surely," he said, taking it, and holding it\r\nfast--a hand so different from that weak woman\'s hand that clung to\r\nGerald without any force to hold him, in Wentworth Rectory. Those\r\nreluctant fingers, so firm and so soft, which scorned any struggle to\r\nwithdraw themselves, but remained passive in his with a more effectual\r\nprotest still against his grasp, wrung the very heart of the Perpetual\r\nCurate. He let them go with a sigh of vexation and disappointment.\r\n"Since that is all I can do, I will do it," he said--"that or anything\r\nelse." She had left him almost before the words were said; and it was in\r\na very disconsolate mood that he turned back into the deserted\r\ndrawing-room. To tell the truth, he forgot everything else for the\r\nmoment, asking himself what it could mean; and walked about stumbling\r\nover the chairs, feeling all his little edifice of personal consolation\r\nfalling to the winds, and not caring much though everything else should\r\nfollow. He was in this state of mind when Miss Wodehouse came to him,\r\nmoving with noiseless steps, as everybody did in the stricken house.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr Wentworth, I am so glad you have come," said that mild woman,\r\nholding out both her hands to him. She was too much agitated to say\r\nanything more. She was not equal to the emergency, or any emergency,\r\nbut sank down on a chair, and relieved herself by tears, while the\r\nCurate stood anxiously by, waiting for what she had to say to him. "My\r\nfather is very ill," she said, like Lucy, through her crying; "I don\'t\r\nknow what good anybody can do; but thank God you\'ve come home--now I\r\nshall feel I have somebody to apply to, whatever happens," said poor\r\nMiss Wodehouse, drying the eyes that were suffused again the next\r\nmoment. Her helpless distress did not overwhelm the spectator, like\r\nLucy\'s restrained trouble, but that was natural enough.\r\n\r\n"Tell me about it," said Mr Wentworth; "the cause--can I guess at the\r\ncause? it is something about your--"\r\n\r\n"Oh hush! don\'t say his name," cried Miss Wodehouse. "Yes, yes, what\r\nelse could it be? Oh, Mr Wentworth, will you close the door, please,\r\nand see that there\'s no one about. I dare not speak to you till I am\r\nsure there\'s no one listening; not that I suspect anybody of\r\nlistening," said the distressed woman; "but one never knows. I am\r\nafraid it is all my fault," she continued, getting up suddenly to see\r\nthat the windows were closed. "I ought to have sent him away, instead\r\nof putting my trouble upon you; and now he is in greater danger than\r\never. Oh, Mr Wentworth, I meant it for the best; and now, unless you\r\ncan help us, I don\'t know what I am to do."\r\n\r\n"I cannot help you unless you tell me what is wrong," said the Curate,\r\nmaking her sit down, and drawing a chair close to her. He took her\r\nhand, by way of compelling her attention--a fair, soft hand, too, in\r\nits restless, anxious way. He held it in a brotherly grasp, trying to\r\nrestore her to coherence, and induce her to speak.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know enough about business to tell you," she said. "He was in\r\ndanger when I threw him upon your charity; and oh, Mr Wentworth, thank\r\nyou, thank you a thousand times, for taking him in like a brother. If\r\nLucy only knew! But I don\'t feel as if I dared to tell her--and yet I\r\nsometimes think I ought, for your--I mean for all our sakes. Yes, I will\r\ntry to explain it if I can; but I can\'t--indeed I don\'t understand,"\r\ncried the poor lady, in despair. "It is something about a bill--it was\r\nsomething about a bill before; and I thought I could soften papa, and\r\npersuade him to be merciful; but it has all turned to greater\r\nwretchedness and misery. The first one was paid, you know, and I thought\r\npapa might relent;--but--don\'t cast us off, Mr Wentworth--don\'t go and\r\ndenounce him; you might, but you will not. It would be justice, I\r\nacknowledge," cried the weeping woman; "but there is something higher\r\nthan justice even in this world. You are younger than I am, and so is\r\nLucy; but you are better than me, you young people, and you must be more\r\nmerciful too. I have seen you going among the poor people and among the\r\nsick, and I could not have done it; and you won\'t forsake me--oh, Mr\r\nWentworth, you won\'t forsake me, when you know that my trouble is\r\ngreater than I can bear!"\r\n\r\n"I will not forsake you," said the Curate; "but tell me what it is. I\r\nhave been summoned to Carlingford by my brother, and I am bewildered\r\nand disturbed beyond what I can tell you--"\r\n\r\n"By your brother?" said Miss Wodehouse, with her unfailing instinct of\r\ninterest in other people. "I hope there is no trouble in your own\r\nfamily, Mr Wentworth. One gets so selfish when one is in great\r\ndistress. I hope he is not ill. It sounds as if there was comfort in\r\nthe very name of a brother," said the gentle woman, drying her tears,\r\n"and I hope it is so with you; but it isn\'t always so. I hope you will\r\nfind he is better when you get home. I am very, very sorry to hear\r\nthat you are in trouble too."\r\n\r\nMr Wentworth got up from his chair with a sigh of impatience. "Will\r\nnobody tell me what is the matter?" he said. "Mr Wodehouse is ill, and\r\nthere is some mysterious cause for it; and you are miserable, and\r\nthere is a cause for that too; and I am to do something to set things\r\nright without knowing what is wrong. Will you not tell me? What is it?\r\nHas your--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr Wentworth, don\'t say anybody\'s name--don\'t speak so loud.\r\nThere may be a servant in the staircase or something," cried Miss\r\nWodehouse. "I hear somebody coming now." She got up to listen, her\r\nface growing white with panic, and went a few steps towards the door,\r\nand then tottered into another chair, unable to command herself. A\r\ncertain sick thrill of apprehension came over the Curate, too, as he\r\nhastened forward. He could not tell what he was afraid of, or whether\r\nit was only the accumulated agitation of the day that made him weak.\r\nSomebody was coming up the stairs, and towards the room, with a\r\nfootstep more careless than those stealthy steps with which all the\r\nservants were stealing about the house. Whoever he was, he stopped at\r\nthe door a moment, and then looked cautiously in. When he saw the\r\nfigure of the Curate in the imperfect light, he withdrew his head\r\nagain as if deliberating with himself, and then, with a sudden rush,\r\ncame in, and shut the door after him. "Confound these servants,\r\nthey\'re always prowling about the house," said the new-comer. He was\r\nan alarming apparition in his great beard and his shabbiness, and the\r\nfugitive look he had. "I couldn\'t help it," he broke forth, with a\r\nspontaneous burst of apology and self-defence. "I heard he was ill,\r\nand I couldn\'t keep quiet. How is he? You don\'t mean to say _that\'s_\r\nmy fault. Molly, can\'t you speak to me? How could I tell I should find\r\nyou and the parson alone here, and all safe? I might have been risking\r\nmy--my--freedom--everything I care for; but when I heard he was ill, I\r\ncouldn\'t stay quiet. Is he dying?--what\'s the matter? Molly, can\'t you\r\nspeak?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr Wentworth, somebody will see him," cried Miss Wodehouse,\r\nwringing her hands. "Oh Tom, Tom, how could you do it? Suppose\r\nsomebody was to come in--John or somebody. If you care for your own\r\nlife, oh, go away, go away!"\r\n\r\n"They can\'t touch my life," said the stranger, sullenly. "I daresay\r\nshe doesn\'t know that. Nor the parson need not look superior--there\r\nare more people concerned than I; but if I\'ve risked everything to\r\nhear, you may surely tell me how the old man is."\r\n\r\n"If it was love that brought you," said poor Miss Wodehouse; "but oh,\r\nTom, you know I can\'t believe that. He is very, very ill; and it is\r\nyou that have done it," cried the mild woman, in a little gush of\r\npassion--"you whom he has forgiven and forgiven till his heart is\r\nsick. Go away, I tell you, go away from the house that you have\r\nshamed. Oh, Mr Wentworth, take him away," she cried, turning to the\r\nCurate with clasped hands--"tell him to hide--to fly--or he\'ll be\r\ntaken: he will not be forgiven this time; and if my father--if my dear\r\nfather dies--" But when she got so far her agitation interrupted her.\r\nShe kept her eyes upon the door with a wild look of terror, and waved\r\nher helpless hands to warn the intruder away.\r\n\r\n"If he dies, matters will be altered," said the stranger: "you and I\r\nmight change places then, for that matter. I\'m going away from\r\nCarlingford. I can\'t stay in such a wretched hole any longer. It\'s\r\ngout or something?" said the man, with a tone of nature breaking\r\nthrough his bravado--"it\'s not anything that has happened? Say so, and\r\nI\'ll never trouble you more."\r\n\r\n"Oh, if Lucy were to see him!" said poor Miss Wodehouse. The words\r\ncame unawares out of her heart without any thought; but the next thing\r\nof which she was conscious was that the Perpetual Curate had laid his\r\nhand on the stranger\'s arm, and was leading him reluctantly away. "I\r\nwill tell you all you want to know," said Mr Wentworth, "but not\r\nhere;" and with his hand upon the other\'s arm, moved him somehow with\r\nan irresistible command, half physical, half mental, to the door.\r\nBefore Miss Wodehouse could say anything they were gone; before she\r\ncould venture to draw that long sighing breath of relief, she heard\r\nthe door below close, and the retreating footsteps in the garden. But\r\nthe sound, thankful though she was, moved her to another burst of\r\nbitter tears. "To think I should have to tell a stranger to take him\r\naway," she sobbed, out of the anguish of her heart; and sat weeping\r\nover him with a relenting that wrung her tender spirit, without power\r\nto move till the servant came up with alarmed looks to ask if any one\r\nhad come in in his absence. "Oh, no; it was only Mr Wentworth--and\r\na--gentleman who came to fetch him," said Miss Wodehouse. And she got\r\nup, trembling as she was, and told John he had better shut up the\r\nhouse and go to bed. "For I hope papa will have a better night, and\r\nwe must not waste our strength," she said, with a kind of woeful\r\nsmile, which was a wonder to John. He said Miss Wodehouse was a\r\ntender-hearted one, to be sure, when he went down-stairs; but that was\r\nno very novel piece of information to anybody there.\r\n\r\nMeantime the Curate went down Grange Lane with that strange lodger of\r\nMrs Hadwin\'s, who had broken thus into Miss Wodehouse\'s solitude. They\r\ndid not say much to each other as they went sullenly side by side down\r\nthe silent road; for the stranger, whose feelings were not complicated\r\nby any very lively sense of gratitude, looked upon his companion as a\r\nkind of jailer, and had an unspeakable grudge against the man who\r\nexercised so calm an ascendancy over him; though to be sure it might\r\nhave been difficult to resist the moral force of the Curate of St\r\nRoque\'s, who was three inches taller than himself, and had the\r\nunbroken vigour of youth and health to back him. As for Mr Wentworth,\r\nhe went on without speaking, with a bitterness in his heart not to be\r\nexpressed. His own personal stronghold of happiness and consolation\r\nhad shattered in pieces in that evening\'s interview; and as he went to\r\nhis own house he asked himself what he should find in it? This\r\nwretched man, with whose sins he had been hitherto but partially\r\nacquainted; and Jack, with whom the other had heaven knew what\r\nhorrible connection. Should he find a den of thieves where he had left\r\nonly high thoughts and lofty intentions? It was thus, after his three\r\ndays\' absence, that he returned home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Mr Wentworth entered Mrs Hadwin\'s garden in the dark, his first\r\nglance up at the house showed him that a certain change had passed on\r\nit also. The decorous little house had been turned inside out. The\r\nwindows of his own sitting-room were open, the blind drawn up to the\r\ntop, and in addition to his usual lamp some candles were flaring\r\nwildly in the draught. He could see into the room as he paused at the\r\ngarden-door, and was able to distinguish that the table was still\r\ncovered as for dinner, and to catch the purple gleam of the light in\r\nthe claret-jug which occupied the place of honour; but nobody was\r\nvisible in the room. That wildly-illuminated and open apartment stood\r\nin strange contrast with the rest of the house, where everything was\r\ndark, save in Mrs Hadwin\'s own chamber. The Curate proceeded on his\r\nway, after that moment\'s pause, with hasty and impatient steps. On the\r\nway up he encountered Sarah the housemaid, who stopped in the middle\r\nof the stairs to make a frightened little curtsy, and utter an alarmed\r\n"La!" of recognition and surprise. But Sarah turned round as soon as\r\nshe had recovered herself, to say that her missis wanted very bad to\r\nsee Mr Wentworth as soon as he came home; but she was gone up to bed\r\nnow, and didn\'t he think it would be a pity to wake her up? The Curate\r\ngave her only a little nod of general acquiescence, as he hurried on;\r\nbut felt, notwithstanding, that this prompt request, ready prepared\r\nfor his arrival, was a tacit protest against his guests, and\r\nexpression of disapproval. Mrs Hadwin was only his landlady, an old\r\nwoman, and not a particularly wise one, but her disapproval vexed the\r\nPerpetual Curate. It was a kind of sign of the times--those times in\r\nwhich it appeared that everybody was ready to turn upon him and\r\nembarrass his path. He had forgotten all about his companion as he\r\nhurried into the familiar room which was so little like itself, but\r\nyet was somehow conscious with annoyance that the stranger followed\r\nhim through its half-shut door. The scene within was one which was\r\nnever effaced from Mr Wentworth\'s memory. There were several bottles\r\nupon the table, which the poor Curate knew by sight, and which had\r\nbeen collected in his little cellar more for the benefit of Wharfside\r\nthan of himself. Removed out of the current of air which was playing\r\nfreely through the apartment, was some one lying on a sofa, with\r\ncandles burning on a table beside him. He was in a dressing-gown, with\r\nhis shirt open at the throat, and his languid frame extended in\r\nperfect repose to catch the refreshment of the breeze. Clouds of\r\nlanguid smoke, which were too far out of the way to feel the draught\r\nbetween the windows, curled over him: he had a cigar in one hand,\r\nwhich he had just taken from his lips, and with which he was faintly\r\nwaving off a big night-moth which had been attracted by the lights;\r\nand a French novel, unmistakable in its paper cover, had closed upon\r\nthe other. Altogether a more languid figure never lay at rest in\r\nundisturbed possession of the most legitimate retirement. He had the\r\nWentworth hair, the golden-brown, which, like all their other family\r\nfeatures, even down to their illnesses, the race was proud of, and a\r\nhandsome silky beard. He had lived a hard life of pleasure and\r\npunishment; but though he had reached middle age, there was not a hair\r\non the handsome reprobate\'s head which had changed out of its original\r\ncolour. He looked languidly up when the door opened, but did not stop\r\nthe delicate fence which he was carrying on against the moth, nor the\r\npolyglot oaths which he was swearing at it softly half under his\r\nbreath.\r\n\r\n"Frank, I suppose," he said, calmly, as the Curate came hastily\r\nforward. "How d\'ye do? I am very glad you\'ve come back. The country\r\nwas very charming the first day, but that\'s a charm that doesn\'t last.\r\nI suppose you\'ve dined: or will you ring and order something?" he\r\nsaid, turning slowly round on his sofa. "Accidente! the thing will\r\nkill itself after all. Would you mind catching it in your handkerchief\r\nbefore you sit down? But don\'t take away the candles. It\'s too late to\r\nmake any exertion," said the elegant prodigal, leaning back languidly\r\non his sofa; "but I assure you that light is half my life."\r\n\r\nThe Curate was tired, heated, and indignant. He lifted the candles\r\naway from the table, and then put them back again, too much excited to\r\nthink of the moth. "Your arrival must have been very sudden," he said,\r\nthrowing himself into the nearest chair. "I was very much surprised by\r\nyour message. It looks inhospitable, but I see you make yourself quite\r\nat home--"\r\n\r\n"Perfectly," said the elder brother, resuming his cigar. "I always do.\r\nIt is much more agreeable for all parties. But I don\'t know how it is\r\nthat a man\'s younger brothers are always so rapid and unreasonable in\r\ntheir movements. Instead of saving that unhappy insect, you have\r\nprecipitated its fate. Poor thing--and it had no soul," said the\r\nintruder, with a tone of pathos. The scene altogether was a curious\r\none. Snugly sheltered from the draught, but enjoying the coolness of\r\nthe atmosphere which it produced, lay the figure on the sofa at\r\nperfect ease and leisure, with the light shed brightly upon him, on\r\nhis shining beard, the white cool expanse of linen at his breast, and\r\nthe bright hues of his dressing-gown. Near him, fatigued, dusty,\r\nindignant, and perplexed, sat the Curate, with the night air playing\r\nupon him, and moving his disordered hair on his forehead; while at the\r\nother end of the room hovered the stranger who had followed Mr\r\nWentworth--a broad, shabby, indistinct figure, who stood with his back\r\nto the others, looking vaguely out of the window into the darkness.\r\nOver these two the night air blew with no small force between the\r\nopen windows, making the candles on the centre table flare wildly, and\r\nflapping the white tablecloth. An occasional puff from the cigar\r\nfloated now and then across the room. It was a pause before the storm.\r\n\r\n"I was about to say," said the Perpetual Curate, "that though it might\r\nseem inhospitable, the first thing I had to ask was, What brought you\r\nhere--and why did you send for me?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be abrupt, pray," said Jack, taking his cigar from his mouth,\r\nand slightly waving the hand that held it. "Don\'t let us plunge into\r\nbusiness all at once. You bring a sense of fatigue into the room with\r\nyou, and the atmosphere was delightful a little while ago. I flatter\r\nmyself I know how to enjoy the cool of the evening. Suppose you were\r\nto--ah--refresh yourself a little," he said, with a disapproving\r\nglance at his brother\'s dusty boots, "before we begin to talk of our\r\naffairs."\r\n\r\nThe Curate of St Roque\'s got up from his chair, feeling that he had an\r\nunchristian inclination to kick the heir of the Wentworths. As he\r\ncould not do that, he shut the window behind him emphatically, and\r\nextinguished the flaring candles on the centre table. "I detest a\r\ndraught," said the Perpetual Curate, which, unfortunately, was not a\r\nstatement entirely founded on fact, though so far true in the present\r\ninstance that he hated anything originated by the intruder. "I have\r\nhurried home in reply to your message, and I should be glad to know\r\nwhat it means, now that I am here--what you are in trouble about--and\r\nwhy you come to me--and what you have to do with him?"\r\n\r\n"But you need not have deranged the temperature," said Jack.\r\n"Impetuosity always distresses me. All these are questions which it\r\nwill take some time to answer. Let me persuade you, in the first\r\nplace, to make yourself comfortable. Don\'t mind me; I am at the crisis\r\nof my novel, which is very interesting. I have just been thinking how\r\nit might be adapted for the stage--there\'s a character that Fechter\r\ncould make anything of. Now, my dear fellow, don\'t stand on ceremony.\r\nTake a bath and change your dress, and in the mean time there will be\r\ntime to cook something--the cookery here is not bad for the country.\r\nAfter that we\'ll discuss all our news. I daresay our friend there is\r\nin no hurry," said the elder brother, opening his book and puffing\r\nslowly towards the Curate the languid smoke of his cigar.\r\n\r\n"But, by Jove, I _am_ in a hurry, though," said that nameless\r\nindividual, coming forward. "It\'s all very well for you: you put a man\r\nup to everything that\'s dangerous, and then you leave him in the\r\nlurch, and say it don\'t matter. I daresay it don\'t matter to you. All\r\nthat you\'ve done has been to share the profit--you\'ve nothing to do\r\nwith the danger; but I\'m savage to-night, and I don\'t mean to stand it\r\nany more," said the stranger, his great chest expanding with a panting\r\nbreath. He, too, looked as if he would have liked to seize the languid\r\nspectator in his teeth and shake some human feeling into him. Jack\r\nWentworth raised his eyebrows and looked at him, as he might have\r\nlooked at a wild beast in a rage.\r\n\r\n"Sit down, savage, and be quiet," he said. "Why should I trouble\r\nmyself about you?--any fool could get into your scrape. I am not in\r\nthe habit of interfering in a case of common crime. What I do, I do\r\nout of pity," he continued, with an air of superiority, quite\r\ndifferent from his tone to his brother. But this look, which had\r\nanswered before, was not successful to-night.\r\n\r\n"By Jove, I _am_ savage!" said the other, setting his teeth, "and I\r\nknow enough of your ways to teach you different behaviour. The parson\r\nhas treated me like a gentleman--like what I used to be, though he\r\ndon\'t like me; but you!--By Jove! It was only my own name I signed,\r\nafter all," he continued, after a pause, lowering his voice; "but you,\r\nyou blackleg--"\r\n\r\n"Stop a little," said the Curate, rising up. "Though you seem both to\r\nhave forgotten it, this is my room. I don\'t mean to have any\r\naltercations here. I have taken you in for the sake of your--family,"\r\nsaid Mr Wentworth, with a momentary gasp, "and you have come because\r\nyou are my brother. I don\'t deny any natural claims upon me; but I am\r\nmaster of my own house and my own leisure. Get up, Jack, and tell me\r\nwhat you want. When I understand what it is, you can lounge at your\r\nwill; but in the mean time get up and explain: and as for you,\r\nWodehouse--"\r\n\r\nJack Wentworth faced round on his sofa, and then, with a kind of\r\ninvoluntary motion, slid his feet to the ground. He looked at his\r\nbrother with extreme amazement as he closed his novel and tossed away\r\nthe end of his cigar. "It\'s much better not to mention names," he\r\nsaid, in a half-apologetic way. "Our friend here is under a temporary\r\ncloud. His name, in fact, is--Smith, I think." But as he spoke he sat\r\nupright, a little startled to find that Frank, whom he remembered only\r\nas a lad, was no longer to be coerced and concussed. As for the other,\r\nhe came forward with the alacrity of a man who began to see some hope.\r\n\r\n"By Jove, my name _is_ Wodehouse, though," he said, in the argumentative\r\ntone which seemed habitual to him; his voice came low and grumbling\r\nthrough his beard. He was not of the class of triumphant sinners,\r\nwhatever wickedness he might be capable of. To tell the truth, he had\r\nlong, long ago fallen out of the butterfly stage of dissipation, and had\r\nnow to be the doer of dirty work, despised and hustled about by such men\r\nas Jack Wentworth. The wages of sin had long been bitter enough, though\r\nhe had neither any hope of freeing himself, nor any wish to do so; but\r\nhe took up a grumbling tone of self-assertion as soon as he had an\r\nopening. "The parson treats me like a gentleman--like what I used to\r\nbe," he repeated, coming into the light, and drawing a chair towards the\r\ntable. "My name is Wodehouse--it\'s my own name that I have signed after\r\nall, by Jove!" said the unlucky prodigal. It seemed to give him a little\r\ncomfort to say that over again, as if to convince himself.\r\n\r\n"As for Wodehouse, I partly understand what he has done," said the\r\nCurate. "It appears likely that he has killed his father, by the way;\r\nbut I suppose you don\'t count that. It is forgery in the mean time; I\r\nunderstand as much."\r\n\r\n"It\'s my name as well as his, by Jove!" interrupted, hastily, the\r\nstranger, under his breath.\r\n\r\n"Such strong terms are unnecessary," said Jack; "everybody knows that\r\nbills are drawn to be renewed, and nursed, and taken care of. We\'ve\r\nhad a great failure in luck as it happens, and these ones have come\r\ndown to this deuced place; and the old fellow, instead of paying them\r\nlike a gentleman, has made a row, and dropped down dead, or something.\r\nI suppose you don\'t know any more than the women have told you. The\r\nold man made a row in the office, and went off in fire and flame, and\r\ngave up our friend here to his partner\'s tender mercies. I sent for\r\nyou, as you\'ve taken charge of him. I suppose you have your reasons.\r\nThis is an unlikely corner to find him in, and I suppose he couldn\'t\r\nbe safer anywhere. That\'s about the state of the case. I came down to\r\nlook after him, out of kind feeling," said the heir of the Wentworths.\r\n"If you don\'t mean to eat any dinner, have a cigar."\r\n\r\n"And what have you to do with each other? what is the connection\r\nbetween you?" said the Curate of St Roque\'s. "I have my reasons, as\r\nyou say, for taking an interest in him--but you--"\r\n\r\n"I am only your elder brother," said Jack, shrugging his shoulders and\r\nresuming his place on the sofa. "We understand that difference.\r\nBusiness connection--that\'s all," he said, leisurely selecting another\r\ncigar from his case. When he had lighted it, he turned round and fixed\r\nhis eyes upon the stranger. "We don\'t want any harm to happen to him,"\r\nhe said, with a little emphasis. "I have come here to protect him. If\r\nhe keeps quiet and doesn\'t show, it will blow over. The keenest spy in\r\nthe place could scarcely suspect him to be here. I have come entirely\r\non his account--much to my own disgust--and yours," said the\r\nexquisite, with another shrug. He laid back his head and looked up at\r\nthe ceiling, contemplating the fragrant wreaths of smoke with the air\r\nof a man perfectly at his ease. "We don\'t mean him to come to any\r\nharm," said Jack Wentworth, and stretched out his elegant limbs on the\r\nsofa, like a potentate satisfied that his protection was enough to\r\nmake any man secure.\r\n\r\n"I\'m too much in their secrets, by Jove!" said poor Wodehouse, in his\r\nbeard. "I _do_ know their secrets, though they talk so big. It\'s not\r\nany consideration for me. It\'s to save themselves, by Jove, that\'s\r\nwhat it is!" cried the indignant drudge, of whom his superior deigned\r\nto take no notice. As for Mr Wentworth, he rose from his seat in a\r\nstate of suppressed indignation, which could not express itself merely\r\nin words.\r\n\r\n"May I ask what share I am expected to play in the drama?" he asked,\r\npushing his chair aside in his excitement. The elder brother turned\r\ninstinctively, and once more slid his feet to the ground. They looked\r\nat each other for a moment; the Curate, pale with a passion which he\r\ncould not conceal, had something in his eyes which brought shame even\r\nto Jack Wentworth\'s face.\r\n\r\n"You can betray him if you like," he said, sulkily. "I have\r\nno--particular interest in the matter; but in that case he had\r\nbetter make the best of his time and get away. You hear?" said the\r\nmaster-spirit, making a sign to Wodehouse. He had roused himself up, and\r\nlooked now like a feline creature preparing for a spring--his eyes were\r\ncast down, but under the eyelids he followed his brother\'s movements\r\nwith vigilant observation. "If you like, you can betray him," he\r\nrepeated, slowly, understanding, as bad men so often do, the\r\ngenerosities of the nature to which his own was so much opposed.\r\n\r\nAnd perhaps there was an undue degree of exasperation in the indignant\r\nfeelings which moved Mr Wentworth. He kicked off his dusty boots with\r\nan indecorum quite unusual to him, and hunted up his slippers out of\r\nthe adjoining room with perhaps an unnecessary amount of noise and\r\nhaste. Then he went and looked out of the window into the serene\r\nsummer darkness and the dewy garden, getting a little fresh air upon\r\nhis heated face. Last of all he came back, peremptory and decided. "I\r\nshall not betray him," said the Perpetual Curate; "but I will have no\r\nfurther schemes concocted nor villany carried on in my house. If I\r\nconsent to shield him, and, if possible, save him from the law, it is\r\nneither for his sake--nor yours," said the indignant young man. "I\r\nsuppose it is no use saying anything about your life; but both of you\r\nhave fathers very like to die of this--"\r\n\r\n"My dear fellow," said Jack Wentworth, "we have gone through that\r\nphase ages ago. Don\'t be so much after date. I have brought down my\r\nfather\'s grey hairs, &c., a hundred times; and, I daresay, so has he.\r\nDon\'t treat us as if we were in the nursery--a parson of advanced\r\nviews like you should have something a little more novel to say."\r\n\r\n"And so I have," said Mr Wentworth, with a heightened colour. "There\r\nare capital rooms at the Blue Boar, which you will find very\r\ncomfortable, I am sure. I don\'t remember that we have ever been more\r\nthan acquaintances; and to take possession of a man\'s house in his\r\nabsence argues a high degree of friendship, as you are aware. It will\r\nbe with difficulty that I shall find room for myself to-night; but\r\nto-morrow, I trust, if business requires you to remain in Carlingford,\r\nyou will be able to find accommodation at the Blue Boar."\r\n\r\nThe elder brother grew very red all over his face. "I will go at\r\nonce," he said, with a little start; and then he took a second\r\nthought. "It is a poor sort of way of winning a victory," he said, in\r\ncontemptuous tones, after he had overcome his first impulse; "but if\r\nyou choose that, it is no matter to me. I\'ll go to-morrow, as you\r\nsay--to pack up to-night is too much for my energies. In the mean time\r\nit won\'t disturb you, I hope, if I go on with my novel. I don\'t\r\nsuppose any further civilities are necessary between you and me," said\r\nJack, once more putting up his feet on the sofa. He arranged himself\r\nwith an indifference which was too genuine for bravado, opening his\r\nbook, and puffing his cigar with great coolness. He did all but turn\r\nhis back upon the others, and drew the little table nearer to him, in\r\nutter disregard of the fact that the Curate was leaning his arm on it.\r\nIn short, he retired from the contest with a kind of grandeur, with\r\nhis cigar and his novel, and the candles which lighted him up\r\nplacidly, and made him look like the master of the house and the\r\nsituation. There was a pause for some minutes, during which the others\r\nlooked on--Mr Wentworth with a perfectly unreasonable sense of defeat,\r\nand poor Wodehouse with that strange kind of admiration which an\r\nunsuccessful good-for-nothing naturally feels for a triumphant rascal.\r\nThey were in the shade looking on, and he in the light enjoying\r\nhimself calmly in his way. The sight put an end to various twinges of\r\nrepentance in the bosom of the inferior sinner. Jack Wentworth, lying\r\non the sofa in superb indifference, victorious over all sense of\r\nright, did more to confirm his humble admirer in the life which he had\r\nalmost made up his mind to abandon, than even his own inclination\r\ntowards forbidden pleasure. He was dazzled by the success of his\r\nprincipal; and in comparison with that instructive sight, his father\'s\r\nprobable deathbed, his sisters\' tears, and even his own present\r\ndiscomfort, faded into insignificance. What Jack Wentworth was, Tom\r\nWodehouse could never be; but at least he could follow his great model\r\nhumbly and afar off. These sentiments made him receive but sulkily the\r\nadmonitions of the Curate, when he led the way out of the preoccupied\r\nsitting-room; for Mr Wentworth was certainly not the victor in this\r\npassage of arms.\r\n\r\n"I will do what I can to help you out of this," said the Curate,\r\npausing within the door of Wodehouse\'s room, "for the sake of\r\nyour--friends. But look here, Wodehouse; I have not preached to you\r\nhitherto, and I don\'t mean to do so now. When a man has done a crime,\r\nhe is generally past preaching. The law will punish you for forging\r\nyour father\'s name--"\r\n\r\n"It\'s _my_ name as well as his, by Jove!" interrupted the culprit,\r\nsullenly; "I\'ve a right to sign it wherever I please."\r\n\r\n"But the law," said Mr Wentworth, with emphasis, "has nothing to do\r\nwith the breaking of your father\'s heart. If he dies, think whether\r\nthe recollection will be a comfortable one. I will save you, if I can,\r\nand there is time, though I am compromised already, and it may do me\r\nserious injury. If you get free and are cleared from this, will you go\r\naway and break off your connection with--yes, you are quite right--I\r\nmean with my brother, whatever the connection may be? I will only\r\nexert myself for you on condition that you promise. You will go away\r\nsomehow, and break off your old habits, and try if it is possible to\r\nbegin anew?"\r\n\r\nWodehouse paused before he answered. The vision of Jack in the\r\nCurate\'s sitting-room still dazzled him. "You daren\'t say as much to\r\nyour brother as you say to me," he replied, after a while, in his\r\nsulky way; "but I\'m a gentleman, by Jove, as well as he is." And he\r\nthrew himself down in a chair, and bit his nails, and grumbled into\r\nhis beard. "It\'s hard to ask a fellow to give up his liberty," he\r\nsaid, without lifting his eyes. Mr Wentworth, perhaps, was a little\r\ncontemptuous of the sullen wretch who already had involved him in so\r\nmuch annoyance and trouble.\r\n\r\n"You can take your choice," he said; "the law will respect your\r\nliberty less than I shall;" and all the Curate\'s self-control could\r\nnot conceal a certain amount of disdain.\r\n\r\n"By Jove!" said Wodehouse, lifting up his eyes, "if the old man should\r\ndie, you\'d change your tone;" and then he stopped short and looked\r\nsuspiciously at the Curate. "There\'s no will, and I\'m the heir," he\r\nsaid, with sullen braggadocio. Mr Wentworth was still young, and this\r\nlook made him sick with disgust and indignation.\r\n\r\n"Then you can take your chance," he said, impatiently, making a hasty\r\nstep to the door. He would not return, though his ungrateful guest\r\ncalled him back, but went away, much excited and disgusted, to see if\r\nthe fresh air outside would restore his composure. On his way\r\ndown-stairs, he again met Sarah, who was hovering about in a restless\r\nstate of curiosity. "I\'ve made a bed for you, please, sir, in the little\r\ndressing-room," said Sarah; "and, please, Cook wants to know, wouldn\'t\r\nyou have anything to eat?" The question reminded Mr Wentworth that he\r\nhad eaten nothing since luncheon, which he took in his father\'s house.\r\nHuman nature, which can bear great blows with elasticity so wonderful,\r\nis apt to be put out, as everybody knows, by their most trifling\r\naccessories, and a man naturally feels miserable when he had had no\r\ndinner, and has not a place to shelter him while he snatches a necessary\r\nmouthful. "Never mind; all the rooms are occupied to-night," said the\r\nPerpetual Curate, feeling thoroughly wretched. But Cook and Sarah had\r\narranged all that, being naturally indignant that their favourite\r\nclergyman should be put "upon" by his disorderly and unexpected guests.\r\n\r\n"I have set your tray, sir, in missis\'s parlour," said Sarah, opening\r\nthe door to that sanctuary; and it is impossible to describe the sense\r\nof relief with which the Perpetual Curate flung himself down on Mrs\r\nHadwin\'s sofa, deranging a quantity of cushions and elaborate\r\ncrochet-work draperies without knowing it. Here at least he was safe\r\nfrom intrusion. But his reflections were far from being agreeable as\r\nhe ate his beef-steak. Here he was, without any fault of his own,\r\nplunged into the midst of a complication of disgrace and vice. Perhaps\r\nalready the name of Lucy Wodehouse was branded with her brother\'s\r\nshame; perhaps still more overwhelming infamy might overtake, through\r\nthat means, the heir and the name of the Wentworths. And for himself,\r\nwhat he had to do was to attempt with all his powers to defeat\r\njustice, and save from punishment a criminal for whom it was\r\nimpossible to feel either sympathy or hope. When he thought of Jack\r\nup-stairs on the sofa over his French novel, the heart of the Curate\r\nburned within him with indignation and resentment; and his disgust at\r\nhis other guest was, if less intense, an equally painful sensation. It\r\nwas hard to waste his strength, and perhaps compromise his character,\r\nfor such men as these; but on the other hand he saw his father, with\r\nthat malady of the Wentworths hanging over his head, doing his best to\r\nlive and last, like a courageous English gentleman as he was, for the\r\nsake of "the girls" and the little children, who had so little to\r\nexpect from Jack; and poor stupid Mr Wodehouse dying of the crime\r\nwhich assailed his own credit as well as his son\'s safety. The Curate\r\nof St Roque\'s drew a long breath, and raised himself up unconsciously\r\nto his full height as he rose to go up-stairs. It was he against the\r\nworld at the moment, as it appeared. He set himself to his uncongenial\r\nwork with a heart that revolted against the evil cause of which he was\r\nabout to constitute himself the champion. But for the Squire, who had\r\nmisjudged him--for Lucy who had received him with such icy smiles, and\r\nclosed up her heart against his entrance;--sometimes there is a kind\r\nof bitter sweetness in the thought of spending love and life in one\r\nlavish and prodigal outburst upon those to whom our hearts are bound,\r\nbut whose affections make us no return.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Curate went to breakfast next morning with a little curiosity and\r\na great deal of painful feeling. He had been inhospitable to his\r\nbrother, and a revulsion had happened such as happens invariably when\r\na generous man is forced by external circumstances to show himself\r\nchurlish. Though his good sense and his pride alike prevented him\r\nfrom changing his resolution of the previous night, still his heart\r\nhad relented toward Jack, and he felt sorry and half ashamed to meet\r\nthe brother to whom he had shown so much temper and so little\r\nkindness. It was much later than usual when he came down-stairs, and\r\nJack was just coming out of the comfortable chamber which belonged of\r\nright to his brother, when the Curate entered the sitting-room. Jack\r\nwas in his dressing-gown, as on the previous night, and came forth\r\nhumming an air out of the \'Trovatore,\' and looking as wholesomely\r\nfresh and clean and dainty as the most honest gentleman in England. He\r\ngave his brother a good-humoured nod, and wished him good morning. "I\r\nam glad to see you don\'t keep distressingly early hours," he said,\r\nbetween the bars of the air he was humming. He was a man of perfect\r\ndigestion, like all the Wentworths, and got up accordingly, in a good\r\ntemper, not disposed to make too much of any little incivility that\r\nmight have taken place. On the contrary, he helped himself to his\r\nbrother\'s favourite omelet with the most engaging cheerfulness, and\r\nentered into such conversation as might be supposed to suit a\r\nPerpetual Curate in a little country town.\r\n\r\n"I daresay you have a good many nice people about here," said Jack.\r\n"I\'ve done nothing but walk about since I came--and it does a man good\r\nto see those fresh little women with their pink cheeks. There\'s one, a\r\nsister of our friend\'s, I believe," he continued, with a nod towards\r\nthe door to indicate Wodehouse--"an uncommonly pretty girl, I can tell\r\nyou; and there\'s a little rosebud of a creature at that shop, whom,\r\nthey tell me, you\'re interested in. Your living is not worth much, I\r\nsuppose? It\'s unlucky having two clergymen in a family; but, to be\r\nsure, you\'re going in for Skelmersdale. By the way, that reminds\r\nme--how are the aunts? I have not heard anything of them for ages.\r\nFemale relations of that description generally cling to the parsons of\r\nthe race. I suppose they are all living--all three? Some people never\r\nseem to die."\r\n\r\n"They are here," said the Curate, succinctly, "living in Carlingford.\r\nI wonder nobody has told you."\r\n\r\nA sudden bright spark lighted in the prodigal\'s eyes. "Ah, they are\r\nhere, are they?" he said, after a momentary pause; "so much the better\r\nfor you; but in justice you ought to be content with the living. I say\r\nso as your elder brother. Gerald has the best right to what they\'ve\r\ngot to leave. By the by, how are Gerald and the rest? you\'ve just been\r\nthere. I suppose our respected parent goes on multiplying. To think of\r\nso many odious little wretches calling themselves Wentworth is enough\r\nto make one disgusted with the name."\r\n\r\n"My father was very ill when I left; he has had another attack," said\r\nthe Curate. "He does not seem able to bear any agitation. Your telegram\r\nupset him altogether. I don\'t know what you\'ve been about--he did not\r\ntell me," continued the younger brother, with a little emotion, "but he\r\nis very uneasy about you."\r\n\r\n"Ah, I daresay," said Jack; "that\'s natural; but he\'s wonderfully\r\ntough for such an old fellow. I should say it would take twenty\r\nattacks to finish him; and this is the second, isn\'t it? I wonder how\r\nlong an interval there was between the two; it would be a pretty\r\ncalculation for a _post-obit_. Wodehouse seems to have brought his\r\nancestor down at the first shot almost; but then there\'s no entail in\r\nhis case, and the old fellow may have made a will. I beg your pardon;\r\nyou don\'t like this sort of talk. I forgot you were a clergyman. I\r\nrather like this town of yours, do you know. Sweet situation, and good\r\nfor the health, I should say. I\'ll take your advice, I think, about\r\nthe--how did you call it?--Black Boar. Unless, indeed, some charitable\r\nfamily would take me in," said the elder brother, with a glance from\r\nunder his eyelids. His real meaning did not in the least degree\r\nsuggest itself to the Curate, who was thinking more of what was past\r\nthan of what was to come.\r\n\r\n"You seem to take a great interest in Wodehouse?" said Mr Wentworth.\r\n\r\n"Yes; and so do you," said Jack, with a keen glance of curiosity--"I\r\ncan\'t tell why. My interest in him is easily explained. If the affair\r\ncame to a trial, it might involve other people who are of retiring\r\ndispositions and dislike publicity. I don\'t mind saying," continued\r\nthe heir of the Wentworths, laying down his knife and fork, and\r\nlooking across at his brother with smiling candour, "that I might\r\nmyself be brought before the world in a way which would wound my\r\nmodesty; so it must not be permitted to go any further, you perceive.\r\nThe partner has got a warrant out, but has not put it into execution\r\nas yet. That\'s why I sent for you. You are the only man, so far as I\r\ncan see, that can be of any use."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what you mean," said the Curate, hastily, "nor what\r\nconnection you can possibly have with Wodehouse; perhaps it is better\r\nnot to inquire. I mean to do my best for him, independent of you."\r\n\r\n"Do," said Jack Wentworth, with a slight yawn; "it is much better not to\r\ninquire. A clergyman runs the risk of hearing things that may shock him\r\nwhen he enters into worldly business; but the position of mediator is\r\nthoroughly professional. Now for the Black Boar. I\'ll send for my traps\r\nwhen I get settled," he said, rising in his languid way. He had made a\r\nvery good breakfast, and he was not at all disposed to make himself\r\nuncomfortable by quarrelling with his brother. Besides, he had a new\r\nidea in his mind. So he gave the Curate another little good-humoured\r\nnod, and disappeared into the sleeping-room, from which he emerged a few\r\nminutes after with a coat replacing the dressing-gown, ready to go out.\r\n"I daresay I shall see you again before I leave Carlingford," he said,\r\nand left the room with the utmost suavity. As for Mr Wentworth, it is\r\nprobable that his brother\'s serenity had quite the reverse of a soothing\r\neffect upon his mind and temper. He rose from the table as soon as Jack\r\nwas gone, and for a long time paced about the room composing himself,\r\nand planning what he was to do--so long, indeed, that Sarah, after\r\ncoming up softly to inspect, had cleared the table and put everything\r\nstraight in the room before the Curate discovered her presence. It was\r\nonly when she came up to him at last, with her little rustical curtsy,\r\nto say that, please, her missis would like to see him for a moment in\r\nthe parlour, that Mr Wentworth found out that she was there. This\r\ninterruption roused him out of his manifold and complicated thoughts. "I\r\nam too busy just now, but I will see Mrs Hadwin to-night," he said; "and\r\nyou can tell her that my brother has gone to get rooms at the Blue\r\nBoar." After he had thus satisfied the sympathetic handmaiden, the\r\nCurate crossed over to the closed door of Wodehouse\'s room and knocked.\r\nThe inmate there was still in bed, as was his custom, and answered Mr\r\nWentworth through his beard in a recumbent voice, less sulky and more\r\nuncertain than on the previous night. Poor Wodehouse had neither the\r\nnerve nor the digestion of his more splendid associate. He had no\r\nstrength of evil in himself when he was out of the way of it; and the\r\nconsequence of a restless night was a natural amount of penitence and\r\nshame in the morning. He met the Curate with a depressed countenance,\r\nand answered all his questions readily enough, even giving him the\r\nparticulars of the forged bills, in respect to which Thomas Wodehouse\r\nthe younger could not, somehow, feel so guilty as if it had been a name\r\ndifferent from his own which he had affixed to those fatal bits of\r\npaper; and he did not hesitate much to promise that he would go abroad\r\nand try to make a new beginning if this matter could be settled. Mr\r\nWentworth went out with some satisfaction after the interview, believing\r\nin his heart that his own remonstrances had had their due effect, as it\r\nis so natural to believe--for he did not know, having slept very\r\nsoundly, that it had rained a good deal during the night, and that Mrs\r\nHadwin\'s biggest tub (for the old lady had a passion for rain-water) was\r\nimmediately under poor Wodehouse\'s window, and kept him awake as it\r\nfilled and ran over all through the summer darkness. The recollection\r\nof Jack Wentworth, even in his hour of success, was insufficient to\r\nfortify the simple soul of his humble admirer against that ominous sound\r\nof the unseen rain, and against the flashes of sudden lightning that\r\nseemed to blaze into his heart. He could not help thinking of his\r\nfather\'s sick-bed in those midnight hours, and of all the melancholy\r\narray of lost years which had made him no longer "a gentleman, as he\r\nused to be," but a skulking vagabond in his native place; and his\r\npenitence lasted till after he had had his breakfast and Mr Wentworth\r\nwas gone. Then perhaps the other side of the question recurred to his\r\nmind, and he began to think that if his father died there might be no\r\nneed for his banishment; but Mr Wentworth knew nothing of this change in\r\nhis _prot\xe9g\xe9\'s_ sentiments, as he went quickly up Grange Lane. Wharfside\r\nand all the district had lain neglected for three long days, as the\r\nCurate was aware, and he had promised to call at No. 10 Prickett\'s Lane,\r\nand to look after the little orphan children whom Lucy had taken charge\r\nof. His occupations, in short, both public and private, were\r\noverpowering, and he could not tell how he was to get through them; for,\r\nin addition to everything else, it was Friday, and there was a litany\r\nservice at twelve o\'clock at St Roque\'s. So the young priest had little\r\ntime to lose as he hurried up once again to Mr Wodehouse\'s green door.\r\n\r\nIt was Miss Wodehouse who came to meet the Curate as soon as his\r\npresence was known in the house--Miss Wodehouse, and not Lucy, who\r\nmade way for her sister to pass her, and took no notice of Mr\r\nWentworth\'s name. The elder sister entered very hurriedly the little\r\nparlour down-stairs, and shut the door fast, and came up to him with\r\nan anxious inquiring face. She told him her father was just the same,\r\nin faltering tones. "And oh, Mr Wentworth, has anything happened?" she\r\nexclaimed, with endless unspeakable questions in her eyes. It was so\r\nhard for the gentle woman to keep her secret--the very sight of\r\nsomebody who knew it was a relief to her heart.\r\n\r\n"I want you to give me full authority to act for you," said the\r\nCurate. "I must go to Mr Wodehouse\'s partner and discuss the whole\r\nmatter."\r\n\r\nHere Miss Wodehouse gave a little cry, and stopped him suddenly. "Oh,\r\nMr Wentworth, it would kill papa to know you had spoken to any one.\r\nYou must send him away," she said, breathless with anxiety and terror.\r\n"To think of discussing it with any one when even Lucy does not\r\nknow--!" She spoke with so much haste and fright that it was scarcely\r\npossible to make out her last words.\r\n\r\n"Nevertheless I must speak to Mr Waters," said the Curate; "I am going\r\nthere now. He knows all about it already, and has a warrant for _his_\r\napprehension; but we must stop that. I will undertake that it shall be\r\npaid, and you must give me full authority to act for you." When Miss\r\nWodehouse met the steady look he gave her, she veered immediately from\r\nher fright at the thought of having it spoken of, to gratitude to him\r\nwho was thus ready to take her burden into his hands.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr Wentworth, it is so good of you--it is like a brother!" said\r\nthe trembling woman; and then she made a pause. "I say a brother," she\r\nsaid, drawing an involuntary moral, "though we have never had any good\r\nof ours; and oh, if Lucy only knew--!"\r\n\r\nThe Curate turned away hastily, and wrung her hand without being aware\r\nof it. "No," he said, with a touch of bitterness, "don\'t let her know.\r\nI don\'t want to appeal to her gratitude;" and with that he became\r\nsilent, and fell to listening, standing in the middle of the room, if\r\nperhaps he might catch any sound of footsteps coming down-stairs.\r\n\r\n"She will know better some day," said Miss Wodehouse, wiping her eyes;\r\n"and oh, Mr Wentworth, if papa ever gets better--!" Here the poor lady\r\nbroke down into inarticulate weeping. "But I know you will stand by\r\nus," she said, amid her tears; "it is all the comfort I have--and\r\nLucy--"\r\n\r\nThere was no sound of any footstep on the stair--nothing but the\r\nticking of the timepiece on the mantelshelf, and the rustling of the\r\ncurtains in the soft morning breeze which came through the open\r\nwindow, and Miss Wodehouse\'s crying. The Curate had not expected to\r\nsee Lucy, and knew in his heart that it was better they should not\r\nmeet just at this moment; but, notwithstanding this, it was strange\r\nhow bitter and disappointed he felt, and what an impatient longing he\r\nhad for one look of her, even though it should be a look which would\r\ndrive him frantic with mortified love and disappointed expectation. To\r\nknow that she was under the same roof, and that she knew he was here,\r\nbut kept away, and did not care to see him, was gall to his excited\r\nmind. He went away hastily, pressing poor Miss Wodehouse\'s hand with a\r\nkind of silent rage. "Don\'t talk about Lucy," he said, half to\r\nhimself, his heart swelling and throbbing at the sound of the name. It\r\nwas the first time he had spoken it aloud to any ear but his own, and\r\nhe left the house tingling with an indignation and mortification and\r\nbitter fondness which could not be expressed in words. What he was\r\nabout to do was for her sake, and he thought to himself, with a\r\nforlorn pride, that she would never know it, and it did not matter. He\r\ncould not tell that Lucy was glancing out furtively over the blind,\r\nashamed of herself in her wounded heart for doing so, and wondering\r\nwhether even now he was occupied with that unworthy love which had\r\nmade an everlasting separation between them. If it had been any one\r\nworthy, it would have been different, poor Lucy thought, as she\r\npressed back the tears into her eyes, and looked out wistfully at him\r\nover the blind. She above-stairs in the sick-room, and he in the fresh\r\ngarden hastening out to his work, were both thinking in their hearts\r\nhow perverse life was, and how hard it was not to be happy--as indeed\r\nthey well might in a general way; though perhaps one glance of the\r\nCurate\'s eyes upward, one meeting of looks, might have resulted quite\r\nreasonably in a more felicitous train of thinking, at least for that\r\nday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Mr Wentworth arrived in the little vestry at St Roque\'s to robe\r\nhimself for the approaching service, it was after a long and tough\r\ncontest with Mr Wodehouse\'s partner, which had to a great extent\r\nexhausted his energies. Mr Wodehouse was the leading attorney in\r\nCarlingford, the chief family solicitor in the county, a man looked upon\r\nwith favourable eyes even by the great people as being himself a cadet\r\nof a county family. His partner, Mr Waters, was altogether a different\r\ndescription of man. He was much more clever, and a good deal more like a\r\ngentleman, but he had not a connection in the world, and had fought his\r\nway up to prosperity through many a narrow, and perhaps, if people spoke\r\ntrue, many a dirty avenue to fortune. He was very glad of the chance\r\nwhich brought his partner\'s reputation and credit thus under his power,\r\nand he was by no means disposed to deal gently with the prodigal son.\r\nThat is to say, he was quite disinclined to let the family out of his\r\nclutches easily, or to consent to be silent and "frustrate the ends of\r\njustice" for anything else than an important equivalent. Mr Wentworth\r\nhad much ado to restrain his temper while the wily attorney talked about\r\nhis conscience; for the Curate was clear-sighted enough to perceive at\r\nthe first glance that Mr Waters had no real intention of proceeding to\r\nextremities. The lawyer would not pledge himself to anything,\r\nnotwithstanding all Mr Wentworth\'s arguments. "Wodehouse himself was of\r\nthe opinion that the law should take its course," he said; but out of\r\nrespect for his partner he might wait a few days to see what turn his\r\nillness would take. "I confess that I am not adapted for my profession,\r\nMr Wentworth. My feelings overcome me a great deal too often," said the\r\nsharp man of business, looking full into the Curate\'s eyes, "and while\r\nthe father is dying I have not the heart to proceed against the son; but\r\nI pledge myself to nothing--recollect, to nothing." And with this and a\r\nvery indignant mind Mr Wentworth had been forced to come away. His\r\nthoughts were occupied with the contrarieties of the world as he\r\nhastened along to St Roque\'s--how one man had to bear another\'s burdens\r\nin every station and capacity of life, and how another man triumphed and\r\ncame to success by means of the misfortunes of his friends. It was hard\r\nto tell what made the difference, or how humankind got divided into\r\nthese two great classes, for possibly enough the sharp attorney was as\r\njust in his way as the Curate; but Mr Wentworth got no more satisfaction\r\nin thinking of it than the speculatists generally have when they\r\ninvestigate this strange, wayward, fantastical humanity which is never\r\nto be calculated upon. He came into the little vestry of St Roque\'s,\r\nwhich was a stony little room with a groined roof and windows too\r\nseverely English in their character to admit any great amount of light,\r\nwith a sensation of fatigue and discouragement very natural to a man who\r\nhad been interfering in other people\'s affairs. There was some comfort\r\nin the litany which he was just going to say, but not much comfort in\r\nany of the human individuals who would come into Mr Wentworth\'s mind as\r\nhe paused in the midst of the suffrage for "sick persons" and for those\r\nwho "had erred and were deceived," that the worshippers might whisper\r\ninto God\'s ear the names for which their hearts were most concerned. The\r\nyoung priest sighed heavily as he put on his surplice, pondering all the\r\nobstinate selfishness and strange contradictions of men; and it was only\r\nwhen he heard a rather loud echo to his breath of weariness that he\r\nlooked up and saw Elsworthy, who was contemplating him with a very\r\ncurious expression of face. The clerk started a little on being\r\ndiscovered, and began to look over all the choristers\' books and set\r\nthem in readiness, though, indeed, there were no choristers on Fridays,\r\nbut only the ladies, who chanted the responses a great deal more\r\nsweetly, and wore no surplices. Thinking of that, it occurred to Mr\r\nWentworth how much he would miss the round full notes which always\r\nbetrayed Lucy\'s presence to him even when he did not see her; and he\r\nforgot Elsworthy, and sighed again without thinking of any comment which\r\nmight be made upon the sound.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry to see, sir, as you aint in your usual good spirits?" said\r\nthat observant spectator, coming closer up to "his clergyman."\r\nElsworthy\'s eyes were full of meanings which Mr Wentworth could not,\r\nand had no wish to, decipher.\r\n\r\n"I am perfectly well, thank you," said the Perpetual Curate, with his\r\ncoldest tone. He had become suspicious of the man, he could scarcely\r\ntell why.\r\n\r\n"There\'s a deal of people in church this morning," said the clerk; and\r\nthen he came closer still, and spoke in a kind of whisper. "About that\r\nlittle matter as we was speaking of, Mr Wentworth--that\'s all\r\nstraight, sir, and there aint no occasion to be vexed. She came back\r\nthis morning," said Elsworthy, under his breath.\r\n\r\n"Who came back this morning?" asked the Curate, with a little\r\nsurprise. His thoughts had been so much with Lucy that no one else\r\noccurred to him at the moment; and even while he asked the question,\r\nhis busy fancy began to wonder where she could have been, and what\r\nmotive could have taken her away?\r\n\r\n"I couldn\'t mean nobody but Rosa, as I talked to you about last\r\nnight," said Elsworthy. "She\'s come back, sir, as you wished; and I\r\n_have_ heard as she was in Carlingford last night just afore you come,\r\nMr Wentworth, when I thought as she was far enough off; which you\'ll\r\nallow, sir, whoever it was she come to see, it wasn\'t the right thing,\r\nnor what her aunt and me had reason to expect."\r\n\r\nThe Curate of St Roque\'s said "Pshaw!" carelessly to himself. He was not\r\nat all interested in Rosa Elsworthy. Instead of making any answer, he\r\ndrew on the scarlet band of his hood, and marched away gravely into the\r\nreading-desk, leaving the vestry-door open behind him for the clerk to\r\nfollow. The little dangers that harassed his personal footsteps had not\r\nyet awakened so much as an anxiety in his mind. Things much more serious\r\npreoccupied his thoughts. He opened his prayer-book with a consciousness\r\nof the good of it which comes to men only now and then. At Oxford, in\r\nhis day, Mr Wentworth had entertained his doubts like others, and like\r\nmost people was aware that there were a great many things in heaven and\r\nearth totally unexplainable by any philosophy. But he had always been\r\nmore of a man than a thinker, even before he became a high Anglican; and\r\nbeing still much in earnest about most things he had to do with, he\r\nfound great comfort just at this moment, amid all his perplexities, in\r\nthe litany he was saying. He was so absorbed in it, and so full of that\r\nappeal out of all troubles and miseries to the God who cannot be\r\nindifferent to His creatures, that he was almost at the last Amen before\r\nhe distinguished that voice, which of all voices was most dear to him.\r\nThe heart of the young man swelled, when he heard it, with a mingled\r\nthrill of sympathy and wounded feeling. She had not left her father\'s\r\nsick-bed to see _him_, but she _had_ found time to run down the sunny\r\nroad to St Roque\'s to pray for the sick and the poor. When he knelt down\r\nin the reading-desk at the end of the service, was it wrong, instead of\r\nmore abstract supplications, that the young priest said over and over,\r\n"God bless her," in an outburst of pity and tenderness? And he did not\r\ntry to overtake her on the road, as he might have done had his heart\r\nbeen less deeply touched, but went off with abstracted looks to\r\nWharfside, where all the poor people were very glad to see him, and\r\nwhere his absence was spoken of as if he had been three months instead\r\nof three days away. It was like going back a century or two into\r\nprimitive life, to go into "the district," where civilisation did not\r\nprevail to any very distressing extent, and where people in general\r\nspoke their minds freely. But even when he came out of No. 10, where the\r\npoor woman still kept on living, Mr Wentworth was made aware of his\r\nprivate troubles; for on the opposite side of the way, where there was a\r\nlittle bit of vacant ground, the Rector was standing with some of the\r\nschismatics of Wharfside, planning how to place the iron church which,\r\nit was said, he meant to establish in the very heart of the "district."\r\nMr Morgan took off his hat very stiffly to the Perpetual Curate, who\r\nreturned up Prickett\'s Lane with a heightened colour and quickened\r\npulse. A man must be an angel indeed who can see his work taken out of\r\nhis hands and betray no human emotion. Mr Wentworth went into\r\nElsworthy\'s, as he went back, to write a forcible little note to the\r\nRector on the subject before he returned home. It was Rosa who handed\r\nhim the paper he wanted, and he gave her a little nod without looking at\r\nher. But when he had closed his note, and laid it on the counter to be\r\ndelivered, the Curate found her still standing near, and looked at the\r\nlittle blushing creature with some natural admiration. "So you have come\r\nback," he said; "but mind you don\'t go into Grange Lane any more after\r\ndark, little Rosa." When he had left the shop and finished this little\r\nmatter, he bethought himself of his aunts, whom he had not seen since he\r\nreturned. Aunt Dora was not at her usual sentinel window when he crossed\r\nGrange Lane towards their garden-door; and the door itself was open, and\r\nsome one from the Blue Boar was carrying in a large portmanteau. Mr\r\nWentworth\'s curiosity was strangely excited by the sight. He said, "Who\r\nhas come, Lewis?" to Miss Wentworth\'s man, who stood in the hall\r\nsuperintending the arrival, but ran up-stairs without waiting for any\r\nanswer. He felt by instinct that the visitor was some one likely to\r\nincrease the confusion of affairs, and perplex matters more and more to\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nBut even this presentiment did not prepare him for the astonishing sight\r\nwhich met his eyes when he entered the drawing-room. There the three\r\nladies were all assembled, regarding with different developments of\r\ninterest the new-comer, who had thrown himself, half-reclining, on a\r\nsofa. Aunt Dora was sitting by him with a bottle of eau-de-Cologne in\r\nher hand, for this meeting had evidently gone to the heart of the\r\nreturned prodigal. Aunt Dora was ready to have sacrificed all the veal\r\nin the country in honour of Jack\'s repentance; and the Curate stood\r\noutside upon the threshold, looking at the scene with the strangest\r\nhalf-angry, half-comical realisation of the state of mind of the elder\r\nbrother in the parable. He had himself been rather found fault with,\r\nexcused, and tolerated, among his relations; but Jack had at once become\r\nmaster of the position, and taken possession of all their sympathies. Mr\r\nWentworth stood gazing at them, half-amused, and yet more angry than\r\namused--feeling, with a little indignation, as was natural, that the\r\npretended penitence of the clever sinner was far more effective and\r\ninteresting than his own spotless loyalty and truth. To be sure, they\r\nwere only three old ladies--three old aunts--and he smiled at the sight;\r\nbut though he smiled, he did not like it, and perhaps was more abrupt\r\nthan usual in his salutations. Miss Leonora was seated at her\r\nwriting-table, busy with her correspondence. The question of the new\r\ngin-palace was not yet decided, and she had been in the middle of a\r\nletter of encouragement to her agents on the subject, reminding them\r\nthat, even though the licence was granted, the world would still go on\r\nall the same, and that the worst possibilities must be encountered,\r\nwhen Jack the prodigal made his appearance, with all the tokens of\r\nreformation and repentance about him, to throw himself upon the\r\nChristian charity of his relations. A penitent sinner was too tempting a\r\nbait for even Miss Leonora\'s good sense to withstand, and she had\r\npostponed her letter-writing to hear his explanations. But Jack had told\r\nhis story by this time, and had explained how much he wanted to\r\nwithdraw out of the world in which he had been led astray, and how sick\r\nhe was of all its whirl of temptations and disappointment; and Miss\r\nLeonora had returned to her letter when her younger nephew arrived. As\r\nfor Miss Wentworth, she was seated placidly in her usual easy-chair,\r\nsmiling with equable smiles upon both the young men, and lifting her\r\nbeautiful old cheek for Frank to kiss, just as she had lifted it to\r\nJack. It was Miss Dora who was most shaken out of her allegiance; she\r\nwho had always made Frank her special charge. Though she had wept\r\nherself into a day\'s headache on his behalf so short a time ago, aunt\r\nDora for a moment had allowed the more effusive prodigal to supersede\r\nFrank. Instead of taking him into her arms as usual, and clinging to\r\nhim, she only put the hand that held the eau-de-Cologne over his\r\nshoulder as she kissed him. Jack, who had been so dreadfully,\r\ninexpressibly wicked, and who had come back to his aunts to be converted\r\nand restored to his right mind, was more interesting than many curates.\r\nShe sat down again by her penitent as soon as she had saluted his\r\nbrother; and even Miss Leonora, when she paused in her letter, turned\r\nher eyes towards Jack.\r\n\r\n"So Gerald is actually going over to Rome," said the strong-minded\r\naunt. "I never expected anything else. I had a letter from Louisa\r\nyesterday, asking me to use my influence: as if I had any influence\r\nover your brother! If a silly wife was any justification for a man\r\nmaking an idiot of himself, Gerald might be excused; but I suppose the\r\nnext thing we shall hear of will be that you have followed him, Frank.\r\nDid you hear anything further about Janet and that lover of hers? In a\r\nlarge family like ours there is always something troublesome going\r\non," said Miss Leonora. "I am not surprised to hear of your father\'s\r\nattack. _My_ father had a great many attacks, and lived to eighty; but\r\nhe had few difficulties with the female part of his household," she\r\ncontinued, with a grim little smile--for Miss Leonora rather piqued\r\nherself upon her exemption from any known sentimental episode, even\r\nin her youth.\r\n\r\n"Dear Jack\'s return will make up for a great deal," said aunt Dora.\r\n"Oh, Frank, my dear, your brother has made us all so happy. He has\r\njust been telling us that he means to give up all his racing and\r\nbetting and wickedness; and when he has been with us a little, and\r\nlearned to appreciate a domestic circle--" said poor Miss Dora,\r\nputting her handkerchief to her eyes. She was so much overcome that\r\nshe could not finish the sentence. But she put her disengaged hand\r\nupon Jack\'s arm and patted it, and in her heart concluded that as soon\r\nas the blanket was done for Louisa\'s bassinet, she would work him a\r\npair of slippers, which should endear more and more to him the\r\ndomestic circle, and stimulate the new-born virtue in his repentant\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what Jack\'s return may do," said Mr Wentworth, "but I\r\nhope you don\'t imagine it was Gerald who caused my father\'s illness.\r\n_You_ know better, at least," said the indignant Curate, looking at\r\nthe hero on the sofa. That interesting reprobate lifted his eyes with\r\na covert gleam of humour to the unresponsive countenance of his\r\nbrother, and then he stroked his silky beard and sighed.\r\n\r\n"My dear aunt, Frank is right," said Jack, with a melancholy voice. "I\r\nhave not concealed from you that my father has great reason to be\r\noffended with me. I have done very much the reverse of what I ought to\r\nhave done. I see even Frank can\'t forgive me; and I don\'t wonder at\r\nit," said the prodigal, "though I have done him no harm that I know\r\nof;" and again the heir of the Wentworths sighed, and covered his face\r\nfor a moment with his hand.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Frank," cried Miss Dora, with streaming eyes--"oh, my dear\r\nboy!--isn\'t there joy in heaven over one sinner that repenteth? You\'re\r\nnot going to be the wicked elder brother that grudged the prodigal his\r\nwelcome--you\'re not going to give way to jealousy, Frank?"\r\n\r\n"Hold your tongue, Dora," said the iron-grey sister; "I daresay Frank\r\nknows a great deal better than you do; but I want to know about\r\nGerald, and what is to be done. If he goes to Rome, of course you will\r\ntake Wentworth Rectory; so it will not be an unmingled evil," said\r\nMiss Leonora, biting her pen, and throwing a keen glance at the Curate\r\nof St Roque\'s, "especially as you and we differ so entirely in our\r\nviews. I could not consent to appoint anybody to Skelmersdale, even if\r\npoor Mr Shirley were to die, who did not preach the Gospel; and it\r\nwould be sad for you to spend all your life in a Perpetual Curacy,\r\nwhere you could have no income, nor ever hope to be able to marry,"\r\nshe continued steadily, with her eyes fixed upon her nephew. "Of\r\ncourse, if you had entered the Church for the love of the work, it\r\nwould be a different matter," said the strong-minded aunt. "But that\r\nsort of thing seems to have gone out of fashion. I am sorry about\r\nGerald--very sorry; but after what I saw of him, I am not surprised;\r\nand it is a comfort to one\'s mind to think that you will be provided\r\nfor, Frank." Miss Leonora wrote a few words of the letter as she\r\nfinished this speech. What she was saying in that epistle was (in\r\nreference to the gin-palace) that all discouragements were sent by\r\nGod, and that, no doubt, His meaning was, that we should work all the\r\nharder to make way against them. After putting down which encouraging\r\nsentiment, she raised her eyes again, and planted her spear in her\r\nnephew\'s bosom with the greatest composure in the world.\r\n\r\n"My Perpetual Curacy suits me very well," said Mr Wentworth, with a\r\nlittle pride; "and there is a good deal to do in Carlingford. However,\r\nI did not come here to talk about that. The Rector is going to put up\r\nan iron church in my district," said the young man, who was rather\r\nglad of a subject which permitted a little of his indignation to\r\nescape. "It is very easy to interfere with other people\'s work." And\r\nthen he paused, not choosing to grumble to an unsympathetic audience.\r\nTo feel that nobody cares about your feelings, is better than all the\r\nrules of self-control. The Perpetual Curate stopped instinctively with\r\na dignified restraint, which would have been impossible to him under\r\nother circumstances. It was no merit of his, but he reaped the\r\nadvantage of it all the same.\r\n\r\n"But oh, my dear," said Miss Dora, "what a comfort to think of what St\r\nPaul says--\'Whether it be for the right motive or not, Christ is still\r\npreached.\' And one never knows what chance word may touch a heart,"\r\nsaid the poor little woman, shaking her limp curls away from her\r\ncheeks. "It was you being offended with him that made dear Jack think\r\nof coming to us; and what a happiness it is to think that he sees the\r\nerror of his ways!" cried poor Miss Dora, drying her tears. "And oh,\r\nFrank, my dear boy, I trust you will take warning by your brother, and\r\nnot run into temptation," continued the anxious aunt, remembering all\r\nher troubles. "If you were to go wrong, it would take away all the\r\npleasure of life."\r\n\r\n"That is just what I was thinking," said aunt Cecilia from her\r\neasy-chair.\r\n\r\n"For, oh, Frank, my dear," said Miss Dora, much emboldened by this\r\nsupport, "you must consider that you are a clergyman, and there are a\r\ngreat many things that are wrong in a clergyman that would not matter in\r\nanother man. Oh, Leonora, if you would speak to him, he would mind you,"\r\ncried the poor lady; "for you know a clergyman is quite different;" and\r\nMiss Dora again stopped short, and the three aunts looked at the\r\nbewildered Curate, who, for his part, sat gazing at them without an idea\r\nwhat they could mean.\r\n\r\n"What have I been doing that would be right in another man?" he said,\r\nwith a smile which was slightly forced; and then he turned to Jack, who\r\nwas laughing softly under his breath, and stroking his silky beard. The\r\nelder brother was highly amused by the situation altogether, but Frank,\r\nas was natural, did not see it in the same light. "What have you been\r\nsaying?" said the indignant Curate; and his eyes gave forth a sudden\r\nlight which frightened Miss Dora, and brought her in to the rescue.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Frank, he has not been saying anything," cried that troubled\r\nwoman; "it is only what we have heard everywhere. Oh, my dear boy, it\r\nis only for your good I ever thought of speaking. There is nobody in\r\nthe world to whom your welfare is so precious," said poor Miss Dora.\r\n"Oh, Frank, if you and your brother were to have any difference, I\r\nshould think it all my fault--and I always said you did not mean\r\nanything," she said, putting herself and her eau-de-Cologne between\r\nthe two, and looking as if she were about to throw herself into the\r\nCurate\'s arms. "Oh, Frank, dear, don\'t blame any one else--it is my\r\nfault!" cried aunt Dora, with tears; and the tender-hearted foolish\r\ncreature kept between them, ready to rush in if any conflict should\r\noccur, which was a supposition much resented by the Curate of St\r\nRoque\'s.\r\n\r\n"Jack and I have no intention of fighting, I daresay," he said, drawing\r\nhis chair away with some impatience; and Jack lay back on the sofa and\r\nstroked his beard, and looked on with the greatest composure while poor\r\nMiss Dora exhausted her alarm. "It is all my fault," sobbed aunt Dora;\r\n"but, oh, my dear boy, it was only for your good; and I always said you\r\ndid not mean anything," said the discomfited peacemaker. All this,\r\nthough it was highly amusing to the prodigal, was gall and bitterness to\r\nthe Perpetual Curate. It moved him far more deeply than he could have\r\nimagined it possible for anything spoken by his aunt Dora to move him.\r\nPerhaps there is something in human nature which demands to be\r\ncomprehended, even where it is aware that comprehension is impossible;\r\nand it wounded him in the most unreasonable way to have it supposed that\r\nhe was likely to get into any quarrel with his brother, and to see Jack\r\nthus preferred to himself.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be a fool," said Miss Leonora, sharply: "I wish you would\r\nconfine yourself to Louisa\'s bassinet, and talk of things you can\r\nunderstand. I hope Frank knows what he is doing better than a set of\r\nold women. At the same time, Frank," said Miss Leonora, rising and\r\nleading the way to the door, "I want to say a word to you. Don\'t\r\nthink you are above misconception. Most people believe a lie more\r\nreadily than the truth. Dora is a fool," said the elder sister,\r\npausing, when she had led her nephew outside the drawing-room door,\r\n"but so are most people; and I advise you to be careful, and not to\r\ngive occasion for any gossip; otherwise, I don\'t say _I_ disapprove of\r\nyour conduct." She had her pen in one hand, and held out the other to\r\nhim, dismissing him; and even this added to the painful feeling in the\r\nCurate\'s heart.\r\n\r\n"I should hope not," he said, somewhat stiffly; "good-bye--my conduct is\r\nnot likely to be affected by any gossip, and I don\'t see any need for\r\ntaking precautions against imaginary danger." Miss Leonora thought her\r\nnephew looked very ungracious as he went away. She said to herself that\r\nFrank had a great deal of temper, and resembled his mother\'s family more\r\nthan the Wentworths, as she went back to her writing-table; and though\r\nshe could not disapprove of him, she felt vexed somehow at his rectitude\r\nand his impatience of advice; whereas, Jack, poor fellow! who had been a\r\ngreat sinner, was, according to all appearance, a great penitent also,\r\nand a true Wentworth, with all the family features. Such were Miss\r\nLeonora\'s thoughts as she went back to finish her letters, and to\r\nencourage her agents in her London district to carry on the good work.\r\n\r\n"God moves in a mysterious way, His wonders to perform," she wrote\r\napropos of the gin-palace, and set very distinctly before her spiritual\r\nretainers all that Providence might intend by this unexpected hindrance;\r\nand so quite contented herself about her nephew, whose views on this and\r\nmany other subjects were so different from her own.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Mr Wentworth went about the rest of the day\'s work in a not\r\nunusual, but far from pleasant, frame of mind. When one suddenly feels\r\nthat the sympathy upon which one calculated most surely has been\r\nwithdrawn, the shock is naturally considerable. It might not be\r\nanything very great while it lasted, but still one feels the\r\ndifference when it is taken away. Lucy had fallen off from him; and\r\neven aunt Dora had ceased to feel his concerns the first in the world.\r\nHe smiled at himself for the wound he felt; but that did not remove\r\nthe sting of it. After the occupations of the day were over, when at\r\nlast he was going home, and when his work and the sense of fatigue\r\nwhich accompanied it had dulled his mind a little, the Curate felt\r\nhimself still dwelling on the same matter, contemplating it in a\r\nhalf-comic point of view, as proud men are not unapt to contemplate\r\nanything that mortifies them. He began to realise, in a humorous way,\r\nhis own sensations as he stood at the drawing-room door and recognised\r\nthe prodigal on the sofa; and then a smile dawned upon his lip as he\r\nthought once more of the prodigal\'s elder brother, who regarded that\r\nbusiness with unsympathetic eyes and grudged the supper. And from that\r\nhe went into a half-professional line of thought, and imagined to\r\nhimself, half smiling, how, if he had been Dr Cumming or the minister\r\nof Salem Chapel, he might have written a series of sermons on the\r\nunappreciated characters of Scripture, beginning with that virtuous\r\nuninteresting elder brother; from which suggestion, though he was not\r\nthe minister of Salem nor Dr Cumming, it occurred to the Perpetual\r\nCurate to follow out the idea, and to think of such generous careless\r\nsouls as Esau, and such noble unfortunates as the peasant-king, the\r\nmournful magnificent Saul--people not generally approved of, or\r\nenrolled among the martyrs or saints. He was pursuing this kind of\r\nhalf-reverie, half-thought, when he reached his own house. It was\r\nagain late and dark, for he had dined in the mean time, and was going\r\nhome now to write his sermon, in which, no doubt, some of these very\r\nideas were destined to reappear. He opened the garden-gate with his\r\nlatch-key, and paused, with an involuntary sense of the beauty and\r\nfreshness of the night, as soon as he got within the sheltering walls.\r\nThe stars were shining faint and sweet in the summer blue, and all\r\nthe shrubs and the grass breathing forth that subdued breath of\r\nfragrance and conscious invisible life which gives so much sweetness\r\nto the night. He thought he heard whispering voices, as he paused\r\nglancing up at the sky; and then from the side-walk he saw a little\r\nfigure run, and heard a light little footstep fluttering towards the\r\ndoor which he had just closed. Mr Wentworth started and went after\r\nthis little flying figure with some anxiety. Two or three of his long\r\nstrides brought him up with the escaping visitor, as she fumbled in\r\nher agitation over the handle of the door. "You have come again,\r\nnotwithstanding what I said to you? but you must not repeat it, Rosa,"\r\nsaid the Curate; "no good can come of these meetings. I will tell your\r\nuncle, if I ever find you here again."\r\n\r\n"Oh no, no, please don\'t," cried the girl; "but, after all, I don\'t\r\nmind," she said, with more confidence: "he would think it was\r\nsomething very different;" and Rosa raised her eyes to the Curate\'s\r\nface with a coquettish inquiry. She could not divest herself of the\r\nthought that Mr Wentworth was jealous, and did not like to have her\r\ncome there for anybody but himself.\r\n\r\n"If you were not such a child, I should be very angry," said the\r\nCurate; "as it is, I _am_ very angry with the person who deludes you\r\ninto coming. Go home, child," he said, opening the door to her, "and\r\nremember I will not allow you on any pretext to come here again."\r\n\r\nHis words were low, and perhaps Rosa did not care much to listen; but\r\nthere was quite light enough to show them both very plainly, as he\r\nstood at the door and she went out. Just then the Miss Hemmings were\r\ngoing up Grange Lane from a little tea-party with their favourite\r\nmaid, and all their eyes about them. They looked very full in Mr\r\nWentworth\'s face, and said How d\'ye do? as they passed the door; and\r\nwhen they had passed it, they looked at each other with eyes which\r\nspoke volumes. Mr Wentworth shut the door violently with irrepressible\r\nvexation and annoyance when he encountered that glance. He made no\r\nfarewells, nor did he think of taking care of Rosa on the way home as\r\nhe had done before. He was intensely annoyed and vexed, he could not\r\ntell how. And this was how it happened that the last time she was seen\r\nin Carlingford, Rosa Elsworthy was left standing by herself in the\r\ndark at Mr Wentworth\'s door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Curate got up very early next morning. He had his sermon to write\r\nand it was Saturday, and all the events of the week had naturally\r\nenough unsettled his mind, and indisposed him for sermon-writing. When\r\nthe events of life come fast upon a man, it is seldom that he finds\r\nmuch pleasure in abstract literary composition, and the style of the\r\nCurate of St Roque\'s was not of that hortatory and impassioned\r\ncharacter which sometimes gives as much relief to the speaker as\r\nexcitement to the audience. So he got up in the early sweetness of the\r\nsummer morning, when nobody but himself was astir in the house, with\r\nthe sense of entering upon a task, and taking up work which was far\r\nfrom agreeable to him. When he came into the little room which he used\r\nas a study, and threw the window open, and breathed the delicious air\r\nof the morning, which was all thrilling and trembling with the songs\r\nof birds, Mr Wentworth\'s thoughts were far from being concentrated\r\nupon any one subject. He sat down at his writing-table and arranged\r\nhis pens and paper, and wrote down the text he had selected; and when\r\nhe had done so much, and could feel that he had made a beginning, he\r\nleaned back in his chair, and poised the idle pen on his finger, and\r\nabandoned himself to his thoughts. He had so much to think about.\r\nThere was Wodehouse under the same roof, with whom he had felt himself\r\nconstrained to remonstrate very sharply on the previous night. There\r\nwas Jack, so near, and certainly come to Carlingford on no good\r\nerrand. There was Gerald, in his great perplexity and distress, and\r\nthe household at home in their anxiety; and last, but worst of all,\r\nhis fancy would go fluttering about the doors of the sick chamber in\r\nGrange Lane, longing and wondering. He asked himself what it could be\r\nwhich had raised that impalpable wall between Lucy and himself--that\r\nbarrier too strong to be overthrown, too ethereal to be complained of;\r\nand wondered over and over again what her thoughts were towards\r\nhim--whether she thought of him at all, whether she was offended, or\r\nsimply indifferent?--a question which any one else who had observed\r\nLucy as closely could have solved without any difficulty, but which,\r\nto the modest and true love of the Perpetual Curate, was at present\r\nthe grand doubt of all the doubts in the universe. With this matter to\r\nsettle, and with the consciousness that it was still only five\r\no\'clock, and that he was at least one hour beforehand with the world,\r\nit is easy to understand why Mr Wentworth mused and loitered over his\r\nwork, and how, when it was nearly six o\'clock, and Sarah and the cook\r\nwere beginning to stir from their sleep, there still remained only the\r\ntext written upon the sermon-paper, which was so nicely arranged\r\nbefore him on the table. "When the wicked man turneth away from the\r\nevil of his ways, and doeth that which is lawful and right."--This was\r\nthe text; but sitting at the open window, looking out into the garden,\r\nwhere the birds, exempt, as they seemed to think, for once from the\r\nvulgar scrutiny of man, were singing at the pitch of all their voices\r\nas they prepared for breakfast; and where the sweet air of the morning\r\nbreathed into his mind a freshness and hopefulness which youth can\r\nnever resist, and seduced his thoughts away from all the harder\r\nproblems of his life to dwell upon the sweeter trouble of that doubt\r\nabout Lucy,--was not the best means of getting on with his work. He\r\nsat thus leaning back--sometimes dipping his pen in the ink, and\r\nhovering over the paper for two or three seconds at a time, sometimes\r\nreading over the words, and making a faint effort to recall his own\r\nattention to them; for, on the whole, perhaps, it is not of much use\r\ngetting up very early in the morning when the chief consequence of it\r\nis, that a man feels he has an hour to spare, and a little time to\r\nplay before he begins.\r\n\r\nMr Wentworth was still lingering in this peaceful pause, when he\r\nheard, in the stillness, hasty steps coming down Grange Lane. No doubt\r\nit was some workmen going to their work, and he felt it must be nearly\r\nsix o\'clock, and dipped his pen once more in the ink; but, the next\r\nmoment, paused again to listen, feeling in his heart a strange\r\nconviction that the steps would stop at his door, and that something\r\nwas going to happen. He was sure of it, and yet somehow the sound\r\ntingled upon his heart when he heard the bell ring, waking up echoes\r\nin the silent house. Cook and Sarah had not yet given any signs of\r\ncoming down-stairs, and nobody stirred even at the sound of the bell.\r\nMr Wentworth put down his pen altogether, and listened with an anxiety\r\nwhich he could scarcely account for--knowing, as he said to himself,\r\nthat it must be the milk, or the baker, or somebody. But neither the\r\nmilk nor the baker would have dared to knock, and shake, and kick the\r\ndoor as the new arrivals were doing. Mr Wentworth sat still as long as\r\nhe could, then he added to the din they were making outside by an\r\nindignant ring of his own bell; and finally getting anxious, as was\r\nnatural, and bethinking himself of his father\'s attack and Mr\r\nWodehouse\'s illness, the Curate took the matter into his own hands,\r\nand hastened down-stairs to open the door. Mrs Hadwin called to him as\r\nhe passed her room, thinking it was Sarah, and begging for goodness\r\ngracious sake to know directly what was the matter; and he felt\r\nhimself growing agitated as he drew back the complicated bolts, and\r\nturned the key in the door, which was elaborately defenced, as was\r\nnatural. When he hurried out into the garden, the songs of the birds\r\nand the morning air seemed to have changed their character. He\r\nthought he was about to be summoned to the deathbed of one or other of\r\nthe old men upon whom their sons had brought such misery. He was but\r\nlittle acquainted with the fastenings of the garden-door, and fumbled\r\na little over them in his anxiety. "Wait a moment and you shall be\r\nadmitted," he called out to those outside, who still continued to\r\nknock; and he fancied, even in the haste and confusion of the moment,\r\nthat his voice caused some little commotion among them. Mr Wentworth\r\nopened the door, looking anxiously out for some boy with a telegram,\r\nor other such mournful messenger; but to his utter amazement was\r\nnearly knocked down by the sudden plunge of Elsworthy, who entered\r\nwith a spring like that of a wild animal, and whose face looked white\r\nand haggard as he rushed in. He came against the Curate so roughly as\r\nto drive him a step or two farther into the garden, and naturally\r\naroused somewhat sharply the temper of the young man, who had already\r\nbegun to regard him with disagreeable sensations as a kind of spy\r\nagainst himself.\r\n\r\n"What in the world do you want at such an early hour in the morning?"\r\ncried Mr Wentworth--"and what do you mean by making such a noise? Is\r\nMr Wodehouse worse? or what has happened?" for, to tell the truth, he\r\nwas a little relieved to find that the two people outside both\r\nbelonged to Carlingford, and that nowhere was there any visible\r\napparition of a telegraph boy.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t trifle with me, Mr Wentworth," said Elsworthy. "I\'m a poor man;\r\nbut a worm as is trodden on turns. I want my child, sir!--give me my\r\nchild. I\'ll find her out if it was at the end of the world. I\'ve only\r\nbrought down my neighbour with me as I can trust," he continued,\r\nhoarsely--"to save both your characters. I don\'t want to make no talk;\r\nif you do what is right by Rosa, neither me or him will ever say a\r\nword. I want Rosa, Mr Wentworth. Where\'s Rosa? If I had known as it\r\nwas for this you wanted her home! But I\'ll take my oath not to make no\r\ntalk," cried the clerk, with passion and earnestness, which confounded\r\nMr Wentworth--"if you\'ll promise to do what\'s right by her, and let\r\nme take her home."\r\n\r\n"Elsworthy, are you mad?" cried the Curate--"is he out of his senses?\r\nHas anything happened to Rosa? For heaven\'s sake, Hayles, don\'t stand\r\nthere like a man of wood, but tell me if the man\'s crazy, or what he\r\nmeans."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll come in, sir, if you\'ve no objection, and shut the door, not to\r\nmake a talk," said Elsworthy\'s companion, Peter Hayles, the druggist.\r\n"If it can be managed without any gossip, it\'ll be best for all\r\nparties," said this worthy, shutting the door softly after him. "The\r\nthing is, where\'s Rosa, Mr Wentworth? I can\'t think as you\'ve got her\r\nhere."\r\n\r\n"She\'s all the same as my own child!" cried Elsworthy, who was greatly\r\nexcited. "I\'ve had her and loved her since she was a baby. I don\'t\r\nmean to say as I\'d put myself forward to hurt her prospects if she was\r\nmarried in a superior line o\' life; but them as harms Rosa has me to\r\nreckon with," he said, with a kind of fury which sat strangely on the\r\nman. "Mr Wentworth, where\'s the child? God forgive you both, you\'ve\r\ngiven me a night o\' weeping; but if you\'ll do what\'s right by Rosa,\r\nand send her home in the mean time--"\r\n\r\n"Be silent, sir!" cried the Curate. "I know nothing in the world about\r\nRosa. How dare you venture to come on such an errand to me? I don\'t\r\nunderstand how it is," said the young man, growing red and angry,\r\n"that you try so persistently to connect this child with me. I have\r\nnever had anything to do with her, and I will not submit to any such\r\nimpertinent suspicion. Leave my house, sir, immediately, and don\'t\r\ninsult me by making such inquiries here."\r\n\r\nMr Wentworth was very angry in the first flush of his wrath. He did\r\nnot think what misery was involved in the question which had been\r\naddressed to him, nor did he see for the moment the terrible calamity\r\nto Rosa which was suggested by this search for her. He thought only of\r\nhimself, as was natural, at the first shock--of the injurious and\r\ninsulting suspicion with which he seemed to be pursued, and of the\r\nannoyance which she and her friends were causing him. "What do you\r\nmean by rousing a whole household at this hour in the morning?" cried\r\nMr Wentworth, as he saw with vexation, Sarah, very startled and\r\nsleepy, come stealing round by the kitchen door.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t look as if you had wanted any rousing," said Elsworthy, who\r\nwas too much in earnest to own the Curate\'s authority. "She was seen\r\nat your door the last thing last night, and you\'re in your clothes, as\r\nbright as day, and a-waiting for us afore six o\'clock in the morning.\r\nDo you think as I\'ve shut my eyes because it\'s my clergyman?" cried\r\nthe injured man, passionately. "I want my little girl--my little\r\nRosa--as is flesh of my flesh and bone of my bone. If Mr Wentworth\r\ndidn\'t know nothing about it, as he says," cried Elsworthy, with\r\nsudden insight, "he has a feelin\' heart, and he\'d be grieved about the\r\nchild; but he aint grieved, nor concerned, nor nothing in the world\r\nbut angry; and will you tell me there aint nothing to be drawn from\r\nthat? But it\'s far from my intention to raise a talk," said the clerk,\r\ndrawing closer and touching the arm of the Perpetual Curate; "let her\r\ncome back, and if you\'re a man of your word, and behave honourable by\r\nher, there shan\'t be nothing said in Carlingford. I\'ll stand up for\r\nyou, sir, against the world."\r\n\r\nMr Wentworth shook off his assailant\'s hand with a mingled sense of\r\nexasperation and sympathy. "I tell you, upon my honour, I know nothing\r\nabout her," he said. "But it is true enough I have been thinking only\r\nof myself," he continued, addressing the other. "How about the girl?\r\nWhen was she lost? and can\'t you think of any place she can have gone\r\nto? Elsworthy, hear reason," cried the Curate anxiously. "I assure\r\nyou, on my word, that I have never seen her since I closed this\r\ngarden-gate upon her last night."\r\n\r\n"And I would ask you, sir, what had Rosa to do at your garden-gate?"\r\ncried the clerk of St Roque\'s. "He aint denying it, Hayles; you can\r\nsee as he aint a-denying of it. What was it as she came here for but\r\nyou? Mr Wentworth, I\'ve always had a great respect for you," said\r\nElsworthy. "I\'ve respected you as my clergyman, sir, as well as for\r\nother things; but you\'re a young man, and human nature is frail. I say\r\nagain as you needn\'t have no fear of me. I aint one as likes to make a\r\ntalk, and no more is Hayles. Give up the girl, and give me your\r\npromise, and there aint a man living as will be the wiser; Mr\r\nWentworth--"\r\n\r\n"Hold your tongue, sir!" cried the Curate, furious with indignation\r\nand resentment. "Leave this place instantly! If you don\'t want me to\r\npitch you into the middle of the road, hold your tongue and go away.\r\nThe man is mad!" said Mr Wentworth, turning towards the spectator,\r\nHayles, and pausing to take breath. But it was evident that this third\r\nperson was by no means on the Curate\'s side.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, sir, I\'m sure," said Hayles, with a blank countenance.\r\n"It appears to me, sir, as it\'s an awkward business for all parties.\r\nHere\'s the girl gone, and no one knows where. When a girl don\'t come\r\nback to her own \'ome all night, things look serious, sir; and it has\r\nbeen said as the last place she was seen was at your door."\r\n\r\n"Who says so?" cried Mr Wentworth.\r\n\r\n"Well--it was--a party, sir--a highly respectable party--as I have\r\ngood reason to believe," said Hayles, "being a constant customer--one\r\nas there\'s every confidence to be put in. It\'s better not to name no\r\nnames, being at this period of the affair."\r\n\r\nAnd at that moment, unluckily for Mr Wentworth, there suddenly floated\r\nacross his mind the clearest recollection of the Miss Hemmings, and\r\nthe look they gave him in passing. He felt a hot flush rush over his\r\nface as he recalled it. They, then, were his accusers in the first\r\nplace; and for the first time he began to realise how the tide of\r\naccusation would surge through Carlingford, and how circumstances\r\nwould be patched together, and very plausible evidence concocted out\r\nof the few facts which were capable of an inference totally opposed to\r\nthe truth. The blood rushed to his face in an overpowering glow, and\r\nthen he felt the warm tide going back upon his heart, and realised the\r\nposition in which he stood for the first time in its true light.\r\n\r\n"And if you\'ll let me say it, sir," said the judicious Hayles, "though\r\na man may be in a bit of a passion, and speak more strong that is\r\ncalled for, it aint unnatural in the circumstances; things may be\r\nbetter than they appear," said the druggist, mildly; "I don\'t say\r\nnothing against that; it may be as you\'ve took her away, sir (if so be\r\nas you have took her away), for to give her a bit of education, or\r\nsuchlike, before making her your wife; but folks in general aint\r\nexpected to know that; and when a young girl is kep\' out of her \'ome\r\nfor a whole night, it aint wonderful if her friends take fright. It\'s\r\na sad thing for Rosa whoever\'s taken her away, and wherever she is."\r\n\r\nNow, Mr Wentworth, notwithstanding the indignant state of mind which\r\nhe was in, was emphatically of the tolerant temper which is so\r\ncuriously characteristic of his generation. He could not be\r\nunreasonable even in his own cause; he was not partisan enough, even\r\nin his own behalf, to forget that there was another side to the\r\nquestion, nor to see how hard and how sad was that other side. He was\r\nmoved in spite of himself to grieve over Rosa Elsworthy\'s great\r\nmisfortune.\r\n\r\n"Poor little deluded child," he said, sadly; "I acknowledge it is very\r\ndreadful for her and for her friends. I can excuse a man who is mad\r\nwith grief and wretchedness and anxiety, and doesn\'t know what he is\r\nsaying. As for any man in his senses imagining," said the Curate\r\nagain, with a flush of sudden colour, "that I could possibly be\r\nconcerned in anything so base, that is simply absurd. When Elsworthy\r\nreturns to reason, and acknowledges the folly of what he has said, I\r\nwill do anything in the world to help him. It is unnecessary for you\r\nto wait," said Mr Wentworth, turning to Sarah, who had stolen up\r\nbehind, and caught some of the conversation, and who was staring with\r\nround eyes of wonder, partly guessing, partly inquiring, what had\r\nhappened--"these people want me; go indoors and never mind."\r\n\r\n"La, sir! Missis is a-ringing all the bells down to know what \'as\r\n\'appened," said Sarah, holding her ground.\r\n\r\nThis was how it was to be--the name of the Curate of St Roque\'s was to\r\nbe linked to that of Rosa Elsworthy, let the truth be what it might,\r\nin the mouths of every maid and every mistress in Carlingford. He was\r\nseized with a sudden apprehension of this aspect of the matter, and it\r\nwas not wonderful if Mr Wentworth drew his breath hard and set his\r\nteeth, as he ordered the woman away, in a tone which could not be\r\ndisobeyed.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to make no talk," said Elsworthy, who during this time\r\nhad made many efforts to speak; "I\'ve sait it before, and I say it\r\nagain--it\'s Mr Wentworth\'s fault if there\'s any talk. She was seen\r\nhere last night," he went on rapidly, "and afore six o\'clock this\r\nblessed morning, you, as are never known to be stirring early, meets\r\nus at the door, all shaved and dressed; and it aint very difficult to\r\nsee, to them as watches the clergyman\'s countenance," said Elsworthy,\r\nturning from one to another, "as everything isn\'t as straight as it\r\nought to be; but I aint going to make no talk, Mr Wentworth," he went\r\non, drawing closer, and speaking with conciliatory softness; "me and\r\nher aunt, sir, loves her dearly, but we\'re not the folks to stand in\r\nher way, if a gentleman was to take a fancy to Rosa. If you\'ll give me\r\nyour word to make her your wife honourable, and tell me where she is,\r\ntortures wouldn\'t draw no complaints from me. One moment, sir; it aint\r\nonly that she\'s pretty, but she\'s good as well--she won\'t do you no\r\ndiscredit, Mr Wentworth. Put her to school, or what you please, sir,"\r\nsaid Rosa\'s uncle; "me and my wife will never interfere, so be as you\r\nmake her your wife honourable; but I aint a worm to be trampled on,"\r\ncried Elsworthy, as the Curate, finding him approach very closely,\r\nthrust him away with vehement indignation; "I aint a slave to be\r\npushed about. Them as brings Rosa to shame shall come to shame by me;\r\nI\'ll ruin the man as ruins that child. You may turn me out," he cried,\r\nas the Curate laid his powerful hand upon his shoulder and forced him\r\ntowards the door, "but I\'ll come back, and I\'ll bring all Carlingford.\r\nThere shan\'t be a soul in the town as doesn\'t know. Oh, you young\r\nviper, as I thought was a pious clergyman! you aint got rid of me. My\r\nchild--where\'s my child?" cried the infuriated clerk, as he found\r\nhimself ejected into the road outside, and the door suddenly closed\r\nupon him. He turned round to beat upon it in blind fury, and kept\r\ncalling upon Rosa, and wasting his threats and arguments upon the calm\r\nair outside. Some of the maid-servants in the other houses came out,\r\nbroom in hand, to the green doors, to see what was the matter, but\r\nthey were not near enough to hear distinctly, and no early wayfarers\r\nhad as yet invaded the morning quiet of Grange Lane.\r\n\r\nMr Wentworth, white with excitement, and terribly calm and self-possessed,\r\nturned to the amazed and trembling druggist, who still stood inside.\r\n"Look here, Hayles," said the Curate; "I have never seen Rosa Elsworthy\r\nsince I closed this door upon her last night. What had brought her here\r\nI don\'t know--at least she came with no intention of seeing me--and I\r\nreproved her sharply for being out so late. This is all I know about the\r\naffair, and all I intend to say to any one. If that idiot outside\r\nintends to make a disturbance, he must do it; I shall take no further\r\ntrouble to clear myself of such an insane accusation. I think it right\r\nto say as much to you, because you seem to have your senses about you,"\r\nsaid the Curate, pausing, out of breath. He was perfectly calm, but it\r\nwas impossible to ignore the effect of such a scene upon ordinary flesh\r\nand blood. His heart was beating loudly, and his breath came short and\r\nquick. He turned away and walked up to the house-door, and then came\r\nback again. "You understand me, I suppose?" he said; "and if Elsworthy\r\nis not mad, you had better suggest to him not to lose his only chance\r\nof recovering Rosa by vain bluster with me, who know nothing about her.\r\nI shan\'t be idle in the mean time," said Mr Wentworth. All this time\r\nElsworthy was beating against the door, and shouting his threats into\r\nthe quiet of the morning; and Mrs Hadwin had thrown up her window, and\r\nstood there visibly in her nightcap, trying to find out what the noise\r\nwas about, and trembling for the respectability of her house--all which\r\nthe Curate apprehended with that extraordinary swiftness and breadth of\r\nperception which comes to men at the eventful moments of life.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll do my best, sir," said Hayles, who felt that his honour was\r\nappealed to; "but it\'s an awkward business for all parties, that\'s\r\nwhat it is;" and the druggist backed out in a state of great\r\nbewilderment, having a little struggle at the door with Elsworthy to\r\nprevent his re-entrance. "There aint nothing to be got out of _him_,"\r\nsaid Mr Hayles, as he succeeded at last in leading his friend away.\r\nSuch was the conclusion of Mr Wentworth\'s morning studies, and the\r\nsermon which was to have been half written before breakfast upon that\r\neventful Saturday. He went back to the house, as was natural, with\r\nvery different thoughts in his mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first thing Mr Wentworth did was to hasten up-stairs to\r\nWodehouse\'s room. Sarah had gone before him, and was by this time\r\ntalking to her mistress, who had left the window, and stood, still in\r\nher nightcap, at the door of her own chamber. "It\'s something about\r\nRosa Elsworthy, ma\'am," said Sarah; "she\'s gone off with some one,\r\nwhich nothing else was to be expected; and her uncle\'s been a-raving\r\nand a-raging at Mr Wentworth, which proves as a gentleman should never\r\ntake no notice of them shop-girls. I always heard as she was a bad\r\nlot."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr Wentworth--if you would excuse my nightcap," said Mrs\r\nHadwin--"I am so shaken and all of a tremble with that noise; I\r\ncouldn\'t help thinking it must be a murder at the least," said the\r\nlittle old lady; "but I never could believe that there was anything\r\nbetween you and--Sarah, you may go away; I should like to talk to Mr\r\nWentworth by himself," said Mrs Hadwin, suddenly remembering that Mr\r\nWentworth\'s character must not be discussed in the presence of even\r\nher favourite maid.\r\n\r\n"Presently," said the unhappy Curate, with mingled impatience and\r\nresignation; and, after a hasty knock at the door, he went into\r\nWodehouse\'s room, which was opposite, so full of a furious anxiety to\r\nquestion him that he had burst into speech before he perceived that\r\nthe room was empty. "Answer me this instant," he had cried, "where is\r\nRosa Elsworthy?" and then he paused, utterly taken aback. It had not\r\noccurred to him that the culprit would be gone. He had parted with him\r\nlate on the previous night, leaving him, according to appearances, in\r\na state of sulky half-penitence; and now the first impulse of his\r\nconsternation was to look in all the corners for the fugitive. The\r\nroom had evidently been occupied that night; part of the Curate\'s own\r\nwardrobe, which he had bestowed upon his guest, lay about on the\r\nchairs, and on a little table were his tools and the bits of wood with\r\nwhich he did his carving. The window was open, letting in the fresh\r\nair, and altogether the apartment looked so exactly like what it might\r\nhave done had the occupant gone out for a virtuous morning walk, that\r\nMr Wentworth stopped short in blank amazement. It was a relief to him\r\nto hear the curious Sarah still rustling in the passage outside. He\r\ncame out upon her so hastily that Sarah was startled. Perhaps she had\r\nbeen so far excited out of her usual propriety as to think of the\r\nkeyhole as a medium of information.\r\n\r\n"Where is Wode--Mr Smith?" cried the Curate; "he is not in his\r\nroom--he does not generally get up so early. Where is he? Did he go\r\nout last night?"\r\n\r\n"Not as I knows of, sir," said Sarah, who grew a little pale, and gave\r\na second glance at the open door. "Isn\'t the gentleman in his room? He\r\ndo take a walk in the morning, now and again," and Sarah cast an\r\nalarmed look behind to see if her mistress was still within hearing;\r\nbut Mrs Hadwin, intent on questioning Mr Wentworth himself, had\r\nfortunately retired to put on her cap, and closed her door.\r\n\r\n"Where is he?" said the Curate, firmly.\r\n\r\n"Oh, please sir, I don\'t know," said Sarah, who was very near crying.\r\n"He\'s gone out for a walk, that\'s all. Oh, Mr Wentworth, don\'t look at\r\nme so dreadfully, and I\'ll tell you hall," cried the frightened girl,\r\n"_hall_--as true as if I was on my oath. He \'as a taking way with\r\nhim," said poor Sarah, to whom the sulky and shabby rascal was radiant\r\nstill with the fascinating though faded glory of "a gentleman"--"and\r\nhe aint one as has been used to regular hours; and seeing as he was a\r\nfriend of yours, I knew as hall was safe, Mr Wentworth; and oh, sir,\r\nif you\'ll not tell missis, as might be angry. I didn\'t mean no harm;\r\nand knowing as he was a friend of yours, I let him have the key of the\r\nlittle door."\r\n\r\nHere Sarah put her apron to her eyes; she did not cry much into it, or\r\nwet it with her tears--but under its cover she peeped at Mr Wentworth,\r\nand, encouraged by his looks, which did not seem to promise any\r\nimmediate catastrophe, went on with her explanation.\r\n\r\n"He\'s been and took a walk often in the morning," said Sarah, with\r\nlittle gasps which interrupted her voice, "and come in as steady as\r\nsteady, and nothing happened. He\'s gone for a walk now, poor\r\ngentleman. Them as goes out first thing in the morning, can\'t mean no\r\nharm, Mr Wentworth. If it was at night, it would be different," said\r\nthe apologetic Sarah. "He\'ll be in afore we\'ve done our breakfast in\r\nthe kitchen; that\'s his hour, for I always brings him a cup of coffee.\r\nIf you hadn\'t been up not till _your_ hour, sir, you\'d never have\r\nknown nothing about it;" and here even Mrs Hadwin\'s housemaid looked\r\nsharply in the Curate\'s face. "I never knew you so early, sir, not\r\nsince I\'ve been here," said Sarah; and though she was a partisan of Mr\r\nWentworth, it occurred even to Sarah that perhaps, after all,\r\nElsworthy might be right.\r\n\r\n"If he comes in let me know immediately," said the Curate; and he went\r\nto his study and shut himself in, to think it all over with a sense of\r\nbeing baited and baffled on every side. As for Sarah, she went off in\r\ngreat excitement to discuss the whole business with the cook, tossing\r\nher head as she went. "Rosa Elsworthy, indeed!" said Sarah to herself,\r\nthinking her own claims to admiration quite as well worth\r\nconsidering--and Mr Wentworth had already lost one humble follower in\r\nGrange Lane.\r\n\r\nThe Curate sat down at his table as before, and gazed with a kind of\r\nexasperation at the paper and the text out of which his sermon was to\r\nhave come. "When the wicked man turneth away from the evil of his\r\nways"--he began to wonder bitterly whether that ever happened, or if it\r\nwas any good trying to bring it about. If it were really the case that\r\nWodehouse, whom he had been labouring to save from the consequences of\r\none crime, had, at the very crisis of his fate, perpetrated another of\r\nthe basest kind, what was the good of wasting strength in behalf of a\r\nwretch so abandoned? Why should such a man be permitted to live to bring\r\nshame and misery on everybody connected with him? and why, when noxious\r\nvermin of every other description were hunted down and exterminated,\r\nshould the vile human creature be spared to suck the blood of his\r\nfriends? Mr Wentworth grew sanguinary in his thoughts as he leaned back\r\nin his chair, and tried to return to the train of reflection which\r\nElsworthy\'s arrival had banished. That was totally impossible, but\r\nanother train of ideas came fast enough to fill up the vacant space. The\r\nCurate saw himself hemmed in on every side without any way of escape. If\r\nhe could not extract any information from Wodehouse, or if Wodehouse\r\ndenied any knowledge of Rosa, what could he do to clear himself from an\r\nimputation so terrible? and if, on the other hand, Wodehouse did not\r\ncome back, and so pleaded guilty, how could he pursue and put the law\r\nupon the track of the man whom he had just been labouring to save from\r\njustice, and over whose head a criminal prosecution was impending? Mr\r\nWentworth saw nothing but misery, let him turn where he would--nothing\r\nbut disgrace, misapprehension, unjust blame. He divined with the\r\ninstinct of a man in deadly peril, that Elsworthy, who was a mean enough\r\nman in common circumstances, had been inspired by the supposed injury he\r\nhad sustained into a relentless demon; and he saw distinctly how strong\r\nthe chain of evidence was against him, and how little he could do to\r\nclear himself. As his miseries grew upon him, he got up, as was natural,\r\nand began to walk about the room to walk down his impatience, if he\r\ncould, and acquire sufficient composure to enable him to wait for the\r\ntime when Wodehouse might be expected to arrive. Mr Wentworth had\r\nforgotten at the moment that Mrs Hadwin\'s room was next to his study,\r\nand that, as she stood putting on her cap, his footsteps vibrated along\r\nthe flooring, which thrilled under her feet almost as much as under his\r\nown. Mrs Hadwin, as she stood before her glass smoothing her thin little\r\nbraids of white hair, and putting on her cap, could not but wonder to\r\nherself what could make Mr Wentworth walk about the room in such an\r\nagitated way. It was not by any means the custom of the Perpetual\r\nCurate, who, up to the time of his aunts\' arrival in Carlingford, had\r\nknown no special disturbances in his individual career. And then the old\r\nlady thought of that report about little Rosa Elsworthy, which she had\r\nnever believed, and grew troubled, as old ladies are not unapt to do\r\nunder such circumstances, with all that lively faith in the seductions\r\nof "an artful girl," and all that contemptuous pity for a "poor young\r\nman," which seems to come natural to a woman. All the old ladies in\r\nCarlingford, male and female, were but too likely to entertain the same\r\nsentiments, which at least, if they did nothing else, showed a wonderful\r\nfaith in the power of love and folly common to human nature. It did not\r\noccur to Mrs Hadwin any more than it did to Miss Dora, that Mr\r\nWentworth\'s good sense and pride, and superior cultivation, were\r\nsufficient defences against little Rosa\'s dimpled cheeks and bright\r\neyes; and with some few exceptions, such was likely to be the opinion of\r\nthe little world of Carlingford. Mrs Hadwin grew more and more anxious\r\nabout the business as she felt the boards thrill under her feet, and\r\nheard the impatient movements in the next room; and as soon as she had\r\nsettled her cap to her satisfaction, she left her own chamber and went\r\nto knock, as was to be expected, at Mr Wentworth\'s door.\r\n\r\nIt was just at this moment that Mr Wentworth saw Wodehouse\'s shabby\r\nfigure entering at the garden-gate; he turned round suddenly without\r\nhearing Mrs Hadwin\'s knock, and all but ran over the old lady in his\r\nhaste and eagerness--"Pardon me; I am in a great hurry," said the\r\nCurate, darting past her. Just at the moment when she expected her\r\ncuriosity to be satisfied, it was rather hard upon Mrs Hadwin to be\r\ndismissed so summarily. She went down-stairs in a state of great\r\ndignity, with her lace mittens on, and her hands crossed before her.\r\nShe felt she had more and more reason for doubting human nature in\r\ngeneral, and for believing that the Curate of St Roque\'s in particular\r\ncould not bear any close examination into his conduct. Mrs Hadwin sat\r\ndown to her breakfast accordingly with a sense of pitying virtue which\r\nwas sweet to her spirit, notwithstanding that she was, as she would\r\nhave frankly acknowledged, very fond of Mr Wentworth; she said, "Poor\r\nyoung man," to herself, and shook her head over him as she poured out\r\nher solitary cup of tea. She had never been a beauty herself, nor had\r\nshe exercised any overwhelming influence that she could remember over\r\nany one in the days of her distant youth: but being a true woman, Mrs\r\nHadwin believed in Rosa Elsworthy, and pitied, not without a certain\r\nhalf-conscious female disdain, the weakness of the inevitable victim.\r\nHe did not dare to stop to explain to _her_ what it meant. He rushed\r\nout of her way as soon as he saw she meant to question him. That\r\ndesigning girl had got him entirely under her sway, the poor young\r\nman!\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Curate, without a single thought for his landlady, made\r\na rush to Wodehouse\'s room. He did not wait for any answer to his\r\nknock, but went in, not as a matter of policy, but because his\r\neagerness carried him on in spite of himself. To Mr Wentworth\'s great\r\namazement Wodehouse was undressing, intending, apparently, to return\r\nto bed. The shabby fugitive, looking broad and brawny in his\r\nshirt-sleeves, turned round when he heard the voice with an angry\r\nexclamation. His face grew black as he saw the Curate at the door.\r\n"What the deuce have you to do in my room at this hour?" he growled\r\ninto his beard. "Is a man never to have a little peace?" and with that\r\nthrew down his coat, which he still had in his hand, and faced round\r\ntowards the intruder with sullen looks. It was his nature to stand\r\nalways on the defensive, and he had got so much accustomed to being\r\nregarded as a culprit, that he naturally took up the part, whether\r\nthere might be just occasion or not.\r\n\r\n"Where have you been?" exclaimed the Curate; "answer me truly--I can\'t\r\nsubmit to any evasion. I know it all, Wodehouse. Where is she? where\r\nhave you hid her? If you do not give her up, I must give you up to\r\njustice. Do you hear me? where is Rosa Elsworthy? This is a matter\r\nthat touches my honour, and I must know the truth."\r\n\r\nMr Wentworth was so full of the subject that it did not occur to him\r\nhow much time he was giving his antagonist to prepare his answer.\r\nThough Wodehouse was not clever, he had the instinct of a baited\r\nanimal driven to bay; and resistance and denial came natural to a man\r\nwho had been accused and condemned all his life.\r\n\r\n"Rosa Elsworthy?" said the vagabond, "what have I to do with Rosa\r\nElsworthy? A pretty man I should be to run away with a girl; all that\r\nI have in the world is a shilling or two, and, by Jove, it\'s an\r\nexpensive business, that is. You should ask your brother," he\r\ncontinued, giving a furtive glance at the Curate--"it\'s more in his\r\nway, by Jove, than mine."\r\n\r\nMr Wentworth was recalled to himself by this reply. "Where is she?" he\r\nsaid, sternly,--"no trifling. I did not ask if you had taken her away.\r\nI ask, where is she?" He had shut the door behind him, and stood in\r\nthe middle of the room facing Wodehouse, and overawing him by his\r\nsuperior stature, force, and virtue. Before the Curate\'s look the eyes\r\nof the other fell; but he had fallen by chance on a reasonable defence\r\nenough, and so long as he held by that felt himself tolerably safe.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know anything about her," he repeated; "how should I know\r\nanything about her? I aint a fool, by Jove, whatever I may be: a man\r\nmay talk to a pretty girl without any harm. I mayn\'t be as good as a\r\nparson, but, by Jove, I aint a fool," he muttered through his beard.\r\nHe had begun to speak with a kind of sulky self-confidence; but his\r\nvoice sunk lower as he proceeded. Jack Wentworth\'s elegant levity was\r\na terrible failure in the hands of the coarser rascal. He fell back by\r\ndegrees upon the only natural quality which enabled him to offer any\r\nresistance. "By Jove, I aint an idiot," he repeated with dull\r\nobstinacy, and upon that statement made a stand in his dogged,\r\nargumentative way.\r\n\r\n"Would you like it better if I said you were a villain?" asked the\r\nexasperated Curate. "I don\'t want to discuss your character with you.\r\nWhere is Rosa Elsworthy? She is scarcely more than a child," said Mr\r\nWentworth, "and a fool, if you like. But where is she? I warn you\r\nthat unless you tell me you shall have no more assistance from me."\r\n\r\n"And I tell you that I don\'t know," said Wodehouse; and the two men\r\nstood facing each other, one glowing with youthful indignation, the\r\nother enveloped in a cloud of sullen resistance. Just then there came\r\na soft knock at the door, and Sarah peeped in with a coquettish air,\r\nwhich at no other time in her existence had been visible in the sedate\r\ndemeanour of Mrs Hadwin\'s favourite handmaid. The stranger lodger was\r\n"a gentleman," notwithstanding his shabbiness, and he was a very\r\ncivil-spoken gentleman, without a bit of pride; and Sarah was still a\r\nwoman, though she was plain and a housemaid. "Please, sir, I\'ve\r\nbrought you your coffee," said Sarah, and she carried in her tray,\r\nwhich contained all the materials for a plentiful breakfast. When she\r\nsaw Mr Wentworth standing in the room, and Wodehouse in his\r\nshirt-sleeves, Sarah said, "La!" and set down her tray hastily and\r\nvanished; but the episode, short as it was, had not been without its\r\nuse to the culprit who was standing on his defence.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not staying here on my own account," said Wodehouse,--"it\'s no\r\npleasure to me to be here. I\'m staying for your brother\'s sake\r\nand--other people\'s; it\'s no pleasure to me, by Jove! I\'d go to-morrow\r\nif I had my way--but I aint a fool," continued the sulky defendant:\r\n"it\'s of no use asking me such questions. By Jove, I\'ve other things to\r\nthink of than girls; and you know pretty well how much money I\'ve got,"\r\nhe continued, taking out an old purse and emptying out the few shillings\r\nit contained into his hand. When he had thrown them about, out and in,\r\nfor nearly a minute, he turned once more upon the Curate. "I\'d like to\r\nhave a little more pocket-money before I ran away with any one," said\r\nWodehouse, and tossed the shillings back contemptuously. As for Mr\r\nWentworth, his reasonableness once more came greatly in his way. He\r\nbegan to ask himself whether this penniless vagabond, who seemed to have\r\nno dash or daring in his character, could have been the man to carry\r\nlittle Rosa away; and, perplexed by this idea, Mr Wentworth put himself\r\nunawares into the position of his opponent, and in that character made\r\nan appeal to his imaginary generosity and truth.\r\n\r\n"Wodehouse," he said, seriously, "look here. I am likely to be much\r\nannoyed about this, and perhaps injured. I entreat you to tell me, if\r\nyou know, where the girl is. I\'ve been at some little trouble for you;\r\nbe frank with me for once," said the Curate of St Roque\'s. Nothing in\r\nexistence could have prevented himself from responding to such an\r\nappeal, and he made it with a kind of absurd confidence that there\r\nmust be some kindred depths even in the meaner nature with which he\r\nhad to deal, which would have been to Jack Wentworth, had he seen it,\r\na source of inextinguishable laughter. Even Wodehouse was taken by\r\nsurprise. He did not understand Mr Wentworth, but a certain vague idea\r\nthat the Curate was addressing him as if he still were "a gentleman as\r\nhe used to be"--though it did not alter his resolution in any\r\nway--brought a vague flush of shame to his unaccustomed cheek.\r\n\r\n"I aint a fool," he repeated rather hastily, and turned away not to meet\r\nthe Curate\'s eyes. "I\'ve got no money--how should _I_ know anything\r\nabout her? If I had, do you think I should have been here?" he\r\ncontinued, with a sidelong look of inquiry: then he paused and put on\r\nhis coat, and in that garb felt himself more of a match for his\r\nopponent. "I\'ll tell you one thing you\'ll thank me for," he said,--"the\r\nold man is dying, they think. They\'ll be sending for you presently.\r\nThat\'s more important than a talk about a girl. I\'ve been talked to till\r\nI\'m sick," said Wodehouse, with a little burst of irrepressible nature,\r\n"but things may change before you all know where you are." When he had\r\nsaid so much, the fear in his heart awoke again, and he cast another\r\nlook of inquiry and anxiety at the Curate\'s face. But Mr Wentworth was\r\ndisgusted, and had no more to say.\r\n\r\n"Everything changes--except the heart of the churl, which can never be\r\nmade bountiful," said the indignant young priest. It was not a fit\r\nsentiment, perhaps, for a preacher who had just written that text\r\nabout the wicked man turning from the evil of his ways. Mr Wentworth\r\nwent away in a glow of indignation and excitement, and left his guest\r\nto Sarah\'s bountiful provision of hot coffee and new-laid eggs, to\r\nwhich Wodehouse addressed himself with a perfectly good appetite,\r\nnotwithstanding all the events of the morning, and all the mystery of\r\nthe night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Wentworth retired to his own quarters with enough to think about for\r\none morning. He could not make up his mind about Wodehouse--whether he\r\nwas guilty or not guilty. It seemed incredible that, penniless as he\r\nwas, he could have succeeded in carrying off a girl so well known in\r\nCarlingford as Rosa Elsworthy; and, if he had taken her away, how did\r\nit happen that he himself had come back again? The Curate saw clearly\r\nenough that his only chance for exculpating himself in the sight of\r\nthe multitude was by bringing home the guilt to somebody else; and in\r\nproportion to the utter scorn with which he had treated Elsworthy\'s\r\ninsinuations at first, was his serious apprehension now of the danger\r\nwhich surrounded him. He divined all that slander would make of it\r\nwith the quickened intelligence of a man whose entire life, and\r\nreputation dearer than life, were at stake. If it could not be cleared\r\nup--if even any investigation which he might be able to demand was not\r\nperfectly successful--Mr Wentworth was quite well aware that the\r\ncharacter of a clergyman was almost as susceptible as that of a\r\nwoman, and that the vague stigma might haunt and overshadow him all\r\nhis life. The thought was overwhelming at this moment, when his first\r\nhopes of finding a speedy solution of the mystery had come to nothing.\r\nIf he had but lived a century earlier, the chances are that no doubt\r\nof Wodehouse\'s guilt would have entered his mind; but Mr Wentworth was\r\na man of the present age--reasonable to a fault, and apt to consider\r\nother people as much as possible from their own point of view. He did\r\nnot see, looking at the circumstances, how Wodehouse _could_ be guilty;\r\nand the Curate would not permit the strong instinctive certainty that he\r\n_was_ guilty, to move his own mind from what he imagined to be its\r\nbetter judgment. He was thinking it over very gloomily when his\r\nbreakfast was brought to him and his letters, feeling that he could be\r\nsure of nobody in such an emergency, and dreading more the doubt of his\r\nfriends than the clamour of the general world. He could bear (he\r\nimagined) to be hooted at in the streets, if it ever came to that; but\r\nto see the faces of those who loved him troubled with a torturing doubt\r\nof his truth was a terrible thought to the Perpetual Curate. And Lucy?\r\nBut here the young man got up indignant and threw off his fears. He\r\ndoubted her regard with a doubt which threw darkness over the whole\r\nuniverse; but that she should be able for a moment to doubt his entire\r\ndevotion to her, seemed a blindness incredible. No; let who would\r\nbelieve ill of him in this respect, to Lucy such an accusation must look\r\nas monstrous as it was untrue. _She_, at least, knew otherwise; and,\r\ntaking this false comfort to his heart, Mr Wentworth took up his\r\nletters, and presently was deep in the anxieties of his brother Gerald,\r\nwho wrote to him as to a man at leisure, and without any overwhelming\r\nperplexities of his own. It requires a very high amount of unselfishness\r\nin the person thus addressed to prevent a degree of irritation which is\r\nmuch opposed to sympathy; and Mr Wentworth, though he was very impartial\r\nand reasonable, was not, being still young and meaning to be happy,\r\nunselfish to any inhuman degree. He put down Gerald\'s letter, after he\r\nhad read through half of it, with an exclamation of impatience which he\r\ncould not restrain, and then poured out his coffee, which had got cold\r\nin the mean time, and gulped it down with a sense of half-comforting\r\ndisgust--for there are moments when the mortification of the flesh\r\nis a relief to the spirit; and then it occurred to him to remember\r\nWodehouse\'s tray, which was a kind of love-offering to the shabby\r\nvagabond, and the perfect good order in which _he_ had his breakfast;\r\nand Mr Wentworth laughed at himself with a whimsical perception of all\r\nthat was absurd in his own position which did him good, and broke the\r\nspell of his solitary musings. When he took up Gerald\'s letter again, he\r\nread it through. A man more sympathetic, open-hearted, and unselfish\r\nthan Gerald Wentworth did not exist in the world, as his brother well\r\nknew; but nevertheless, Gerald\'s mind was so entirely preoccupied that\r\nhe passed over the Curate\'s cares with the lightest reference\r\nimaginable. "I hope you found all right when you got back, and nothing\r\nseriously amiss with Jack," the elder brother wrote, and then went on to\r\nhis own affairs. All right! nothing seriously amiss! To a man who felt\r\nhimself standing on the edge of possible ruin, such expressions seemed\r\nstrange indeed.\r\n\r\nThe Rector of Wentworth, however, had enough in his mind to excuse him\r\nfor a momentary forgetfulness of others. Things had taken a different\r\nturn with him since his brother left. He had been so busy with his\r\nchange of faith and sentiment, that the practical possibilities of the\r\nstep which he contemplated had not disturbed Gerald. He had taken it\r\ncalmly for granted that he _could_ do what he wanted to do. But a new\r\nlight had burst upon him in that respect, and changed the character of\r\nhis thoughts. Notwithstanding the conviction into which he had\r\nreasoned himself, the Rector of Wentworth had not contemplated the\r\nidea of becoming simply a Catholic layman. He was nothing if not a\r\npriest, he had said, passionately. He could have made a martyr of\r\nhimself--have suffered tortures and deaths with the steadiest\r\nendurance; but he could not face the idea of taking all meaning and\r\nsignificance out of his life, by giving up the profession which he\r\nfelt to be laid upon him by orders indelible, beyond the power of\r\ncircumstances to revoke. Such was the new complication to which Gerald\r\nhad come. He was terribly staggered in his previous resolution by this\r\nnew doubt, and he wrote to pour his difficulties into the ear of his\r\nbrother. It had been Frank\'s question which first awoke in his mind a\r\ndoubt as to the practicability of the step he contemplated; and one of\r\nLouisa\'s relations, appealed to by her in her next access of terror,\r\nhad brought this aspect of the matter still more distinctly before the\r\nRector of Wentworth. Gerald had been studying Canon law, but his\r\nEnglish intelligence did not make very much of it; and the bare idea\r\nof a dispensation making that right which in itself was wrong, touched\r\nthe high-minded gentleman to the quick, and brought him to a sudden\r\nstandstill. He who was nothing if not a priest, stood sorrowfully\r\nlooking at his contemplated martyrdom--like Brother Domenico of St\r\nMark\'s sighing on the edge of the fiery ordeal into which the Church\r\nherself would not let him plunge. If it was so, he no longer knew what\r\nto do. He would have wrapped the vestment of the new priesthood about\r\nhim, though it was a garment of fire; but to stand aside in irksome\r\nleisure was a harder trial, at which he trembled. This was the new\r\ncomplication in which Gerald asked his brother\'s sympathy and counsel.\r\nIt was a long letter, curiously introspective, and full of self-argument;\r\nand it was hard work, with a mind so occupied as was that of the\r\nPerpetual Curate, to give it due attention. He put it away when he had\r\ndone with his cold breakfast, and deferred the consideration of the\r\nsubject, with a kind of vague hope that the family firmament might\r\npossibly brighten in that quarter at least; but the far-off and\r\nindistinct interest with which he viewed, across his own gloomy\r\nsurroundings, this matter which had engrossed him so completely a few\r\ndays before, was wonderful to see.\r\n\r\nAnd then he paused to think what he was to do. To go out and face the\r\nslander which must already have crept forth on its way--to see\r\nElsworthy and ascertain whether he had come to his senses, and try if\r\nanything could be done for Rosa\'s discovery--to exert himself somehow,\r\nin short, and get rid of the feverish activity which he felt consuming\r\nhim,--that was what he longed to do. But, on the other hand, it was\r\nSaturday, and Mr Wentworth was conscious that it would be more\r\ndignified, and in better taste altogether, if he went on writing his\r\nsermon and took no notice of this occurrence, with which, in reality,\r\nhe had nothing to do. It was difficult, but no doubt it was the best;\r\nand he tried it accordingly--putting down a great many sentences which\r\nhad to be scratched out again, and spoiling altogether the appearance\r\nof the sermon-paper. When a message came from Mr Wodehouse\'s about\r\neleven o\'clock, bringing the news that he was much worse and not\r\nexpected to live, and begging Mr Wentworth\'s immediate presence, the\r\nCurate was as nearly glad as it was possible for a man to be under the\r\ncircumstances. He had "a feeling heart," as even Elsworthy allowed,\r\nbut in such a moment of excitement any kind of great and terrible\r\nevent seemed to come natural. He hastened out into the fresh morning\r\nsunshine, which still seemed thrilling with life and joy, and went up\r\nGrange Lane with a certain sense of curiosity, wondering whether\r\neverybody was already aware of what had happened. A long way off a\r\nfigure which much resembled that of the Rector was visible crossing\r\nover to Dr Marjoribanks\'s door; and it occurred to the Curate that Mr\r\nMorgan was crossing to avoid him, which brought a smile of anger and\r\ninvoluntary dislike to his face, and nerved him for any other\r\nencounter. The green door at Mr Wodehouse\'s--a homely sign of the\r\ntrouble in the house--had been left unlatched, and was swinging ajar\r\nwith the wind when the Curate came up; and as he went in (closing it\r\ncarefully after him, for that forlorn little touch of carelessness\r\nwent to his heart), he encountered in the garden Dr Marjoribanks and\r\nDr Rider, who were coming out together with very grave looks. They did\r\nnot stop for much conversation, only pausing to tell him that the case\r\nwas hopeless, and that the patient could not possibly live beyond a\r\nday or two at most; but even in the few words that were spoken Mr\r\nWentworth perceived, or thought he perceived, that something had\r\noccurred to lessen him in the esteem of the shrewd old Scotch doctor,\r\nwho contemplated him and his prayer-book with critical eyes. "I\r\nconfess, after all, that there are cases in which written prayers are\r\na kind of security," Dr Marjoribanks said in an irrelevant manner to\r\nDr Rider when Mr Wentworth had passed them--an observation at which,\r\nin ordinary cases, the Curate would have smiled; but to-day the colour\r\nrose to his face, and he understood that Dr Marjoribanks did not think\r\nhim qualified to carry comfort or instruction to a sick-bed. Perhaps\r\nthe old doctor had no such idea in his mind--perhaps it was simply a\r\nrelic of his national Presbyterianism, to which the old Scotchman kept\r\nup a kind of visionary allegiance. But whether he meant it or not, Mr\r\nWentworth understood it as a reproach to himself, and went on with a\r\nbitter feeling of mortification to the sick-room. He had gone with his\r\nwhole heart into his priestly office, and had been noted for his\r\nministrations to the sick and poor; but now his feelings were much too\r\npersonal for the atmosphere into which he was just about to enter. He\r\nstopped at the door to tell John that he would take a stroll round the\r\ngarden before he came in, as he had a headache, and went on through\r\nthe walks which were sacred to Lucy, not thinking of her, but\r\nwondering bitterly whether anybody would stand by him, or whether an\r\nutterly baseless slander would outweigh all the five years of his life\r\nwhich he had spent among the people of Carlingford. Meanwhile John\r\nstood at the door and watched him, and of course thought it was very\r\n"queer." "It aint as if he\'d a-been sitting up all night, like our\r\nyoung ladies," said John to himself, and unconsciously noted the\r\ncircumstance down in his memory against the Curate.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr Wentworth entered the sick-room, he found all very silent and\r\nstill in that darkened chamber. Lucy was seated by the bedside,\r\nwrapped in a loose dressing-gown, and looked as if she had not slept\r\nfor several nights; while Miss Wodehouse, who, notwithstanding all her\r\nanxiety to be of use, was far more helpless than Lucy, stood on the\r\nside next the door, with her eyes fixed on her sister, watching with\r\npathetic unserviceableness for the moment when she could be of some\r\nuse. As for the patient himself, he lay in a kind of stupor, from\r\nwhich he scarcely ever could be roused, and showed no tokens at the\r\nmoment of hearing or seeing anybody. The scene was doubly sad, but it\r\nwas without the excitement which so often breathes in the atmosphere\r\nof death. There was no eager listening for the last word, no last\r\noutbreaks of tenderness. The daughters were both hushed into utter\r\nsilence; and Lucy, who was more reasonable than her sister, had even\r\ngiven up those wistful beseeching looks at the patient, with which\r\nMiss Wodehouse still regarded him, as if perhaps he might be thus\r\npersuaded to speak. The nurse whom Dr Marjoribanks had sent to assist\r\nthem was visible through an open door, sleeping very comfortably in\r\nthe adjoining room. Mr Wentworth came into the silent chamber with all\r\nhis anxieties throbbing in his heart, bringing life at its very height\r\nof agitation and tumult into the presence of death. He went forward to\r\nthe bed, and tried for an instant to call up any spark of intelligence\r\nthat might yet exist within the mind of the dying man; but Mr\r\nWodehouse was beyond the voice of any priest. The Curate said the\r\nprayers for the dying at the bedside, suddenly filled with a great\r\npity for the man who was thus taking leave unawares of all this\r\nmournful splendid world. Though the young man knew many an ordinary\r\nsentiment about the vanity of life, and had given utterance to that\r\neffect freely in the way of his duty, he was still too fresh in his\r\nheart to conceive actually that any one could leave the world without\r\npoignant regrets; and when his prayer was finished, he stood looking\r\nat the patient with inexpressible compassion. Mr Wodehouse had scarcely\r\nreached old age; he was well off, and only a week ago seemed to have so\r\nmuch to enjoy; now, here he lay stupefied, on the edge of the grave,\r\nunable to respond even by a look to the love that surrounded him. Once\r\nmore there rose in the heart of the young priest a natural impulse of\r\nresentment and indignation; and when he thought of the cause of this\r\nchange, he remembered Wodehouse\'s threat, and roused himself from his\r\ncontemplation of the dying to think of the probable fate of those who\r\nmust live.\r\n\r\n"Has he made his will?" said Mr Wentworth, suddenly. He forgot that it\r\nwas Lucy who was standing by him; and it was only when he caught a\r\nglance of reproach and horror from her eyes that he recollected how\r\nabrupt his question was. "Pardon me," he said; "you think me heartless\r\nto speak of it at such a time; but tell me, if you know: Miss\r\nWodehouse, has he made his will?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr Wentworth, I don\'t know anything about business," said the\r\nelder sister. "He said he would; but we have had other things to think\r\nof--more important things," said poor Miss Wodehouse, wringing her\r\nhands, and looking at Mr Wentworth with eyes full of warning and\r\nmeaning, beseeching him not to betray her secret. She came nearer to\r\nthe side of the bed on which Lucy and the Curate were standing, and\r\nplucked at his sleeve in her anxiety. "We have had very different\r\nthings to think of. Oh, Mr Wentworth, what does it matter?" said the\r\npoor lady, interposing her anxious looks, which suggested every kind\r\nof misfortune, between the two.\r\n\r\n"It matters everything in the world," said Mr Wentworth. "Pardon me if\r\nI wound you--I must speak; if it is possible to rouse him, an effort\r\nmust be made. Send for Mr Waters. He must not be allowed to go out of\r\nthe world and leave your interests in the hands of--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, hush, Mr Wentworth, hush!--oh, hush, hush! Don\'t say any more,"\r\ncried Miss Wodehouse, grasping his arm in her terror.\r\n\r\nLucy rose from where she had been sitting at the bedside. She had\r\ngrown paler than before, and looked almost stern in her youthful\r\ngravity. "I will not permit my father to be disturbed," she said. "I\r\ndon\'t know what you mean, or what you are talking of; but he is not to\r\nbe disturbed. Do you think I will let him be vexed in his last hours\r\nabout money or anybody\'s interest?" she said, turning upon the Curate\r\na momentary glance of scorn. Then she sat down again, with a pang of\r\ndisappointment added to her grief. She could not keep her heart so\r\nmuch apart from him, as not to expect a little comfort from his\r\npresence. And there had been comfort in his prayers and his looks; but\r\nto hear him speak of wills and worldly affairs by her father\'s\r\ndeathbed, as any man might have done, went to Lucy\'s heart. She sat\r\ndown again, putting her hand softly upon the edge of the pillow, to\r\nguard the peace of those last moments which were ebbing away so\r\nrapidly. What if all the comfort of the world hung upon it? Could she\r\nlet her kind father be troubled in his end for anything so miserable?\r\nLucy turned her indignant eyes upon the others with silent resolution.\r\nIt was she who was _his_ protector now.\r\n\r\n"But it must be done," said Mr Wentworth. "You will understand me\r\nhereafter. Miss Wodehouse, you must send for Mr Waters, and in the\r\nmean time I will do what I can to rouse him. It is no such cruelty as\r\nyou think," said the Curate, with humility; "it is not for money or\r\ninterest only--it concerns all the comfort of your life."\r\n\r\nThis he said to Lucy, who sat defending her father. She, for her part,\r\nlooked up at him with eyes that broke his heart. At that moment of all\r\nothers, the unfortunate Curate perceived, by a sudden flash of\r\ninsight, that nothing less than love could look at him with such\r\nforce of disappointment and reproach and wounded feeling. He replied\r\nto the look by a gesture of mingled entreaty and despair.\r\n\r\n"What can I do?" he cried--"you have no one else to care for you. I\r\ncannot even explain to you all that is at stake. I must act as I\r\nought, even though you hate me for it. Let us send for Mr Waters;--if\r\nthere is a will--"\r\n\r\nMr Wentworth had raised his voice a little in the excitement of the\r\nmoment, and the word caught the dull ear of the dying man. The Curate\r\nsaw instantly that there was comprehension in the flicker of the\r\neyelash and the tremulous movement of the hand upon the bed. It was a\r\nnew and unaccustomed part which he had now to play; he went hurriedly\r\nto the other side and leaned over the pillow to make out the\r\nstammering words which began to be audible. Lucy had risen up also and\r\nstood looking at her father still with her look of defence. As the\r\nfeeble lips babbled forth unintelligible words, Lucy\'s face grew\r\nsterner and sterner. As for Miss Wodehouse, she stood behind, crying\r\nand trembling. "Oh, Mr Wentworth, do you think it is returning\r\nlife--do you think he is better?" she cried, looking wistfully at the\r\nCurate; and between the two young people, who were leaning with looks\r\nand feelings so different over his bed, the patient lay struggling\r\nwith those terrible bonds of weakness, labouring to find expression\r\nfor something which wrought him into a fever of excitement. While Mr\r\nWentworth bent his ear closer and closer, trying to make some sense of\r\nthe inarticulate torrent of sound, Lucy, inspired by grief and horror\r\nand indignation, leaned over her father on the other side, doing\r\neverything possible to calm him. "Oh, papa, don\'t say any more--don\'t\r\nsay any more; we understand you," she cried, and put her soft hands\r\nupon his flushed forehead, and her cheek to his. "No more, no more!"\r\ncried the girl in the dulled ear which could not hear. "We will do\r\neverything you wish--we understand all," said Lucy. Mr Wentworth\r\nwithdrew vanquished in that strange struggle--he stood looking on\r\nwhile she caressed and calmed and subdued into silence the dying\r\npassion which he would have given anything in the world to stimulate\r\ninto clearer utterance. She had baffled his efforts, made him helpless\r\nto serve her, perhaps injured herself cruelly; but all the more the\r\nCurate loved her for it, as she expanded over her dying father, with\r\nthe white sleeves hanging loose about her arms like the white wings of\r\nan angel, as he thought. Gradually the agony of utterance got subdued,\r\nand then Lucy resumed her position by the bed. "He shall not be\r\ndisturbed," she said again, through lips that were parched with\r\nemotion; and so sat watchful over him, a guardian immovable, ready to\r\ndefy all the world in defence of his peace.\r\n\r\nMr Wentworth turned away with his heart full. He would have liked to\r\ngo and kiss her hand or her sleeve or anything belonging to her; and\r\nyet he was impatient beyond expression, and felt that she had baffled\r\nand vanquished him. Miss Wodehouse stood behind, still looking on with\r\na half perception of what had happened; but the mind of the elder\r\nsister was occupied with vain hopes and fears, such as inexperienced\r\npeople are subject to in the presence of death.\r\n\r\n"He heard what you said," said Miss Wodehouse; "don\'t you think that\r\nwas a good sign? Oh, Mr Wentworth, sometimes I think he looks a little\r\nbetter," said the poor lady, looking wistfully into the Curate\'s face.\r\nMr Wentworth could only shake his head as he hurried away.\r\n\r\n"I must go and consult Mr Waters," he said, as he passed her. "I shall\r\ncome back presently;" and then Miss Wodehouse followed him to the door,\r\nto beg him not to speak to Mr Waters of _anything particular_--"For papa\r\nhas no confidence in him," she said, anxiously. The Curate was nearly\r\ndriven to his wits\' end as he hastened out. He forgot the clouds that\r\nsurrounded him in his anxiety about this sad household; for it seemed\r\nbut too evident that Mr Wodehouse had made no special provision for his\r\ndaughters; and to think of Lucy under the power of her unknown brother,\r\nmade Mr Wentworth\'s blood boil.\r\n\r\nThe shutters were all put up that afternoon in the prettiest house in\r\nGrange Lane. The event took Carlingford altogether by surprise; but\r\nother events just then were moving the town into the wildest\r\nexcitement; for nothing could be heard, far or near, of poor little\r\nRosa Elsworthy, and everybody was aware that the last time she was\r\nseen in Carlingford she was standing by herself in the dark, at Mr\r\nWentworth\'s garden-door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs Morgan was in the garden watering her favourite ferns when her\r\nhusband returned home to dinner on the day of Mr Wodehouse\'s death. The\r\nRector was late, and she had already changed her dress, and was removing\r\nthe withered leaves from her prettiest plant of maidenhair, and\r\nthinking, with some concern, of the fish, when she heard his step on the\r\ngravel; for the cook at the Rectory was rather hasty in her temper, and\r\nwas apt to be provoking to her mistress next morning when the Rector\r\nchose to be late. It was a very hot day, and Mr Morgan was flushed and\r\nuncomfortable. To see his wife looking so cool and tranquil in her\r\nmuslin dress rather aggravated him than otherwise, for she did not\r\nbetray her anxiety about the trout, but welcomed him with a smile, as\r\nshe felt it her duty to do, even when he was late for dinner. The Rector\r\nlooked as if all the anxieties of the world were on his shoulders, as he\r\ncame hurriedly along the gravel; and Mrs Morgan\'s curiosity was\r\nsufficiently excited by his looks to have overcome any consideration but\r\nthat of the trout, which, however, was too serious to be trifled with;\r\nso, instead of asking questions, she thought it wiser simply to remind\r\nher husband that it was past six o\'clock. "Dinner is waiting," she said,\r\nin her composed way; and the Rector went up-stairs to wash his hands,\r\nhalf disposed to be angry with his wife. He found her already seated at\r\nthe head of the table when he came down after his rapid ablutions; and\r\nthough he was not particularly quick of perception, Mr Morgan perceived,\r\nby the looks of the servant as well as the mistress, that he was\r\ngenerally disapproved of throughout the household for being half an hour\r\ntoo late. As for Thomas, he was at no pains to conceal his sentiments,\r\nbut conducted himself with distant politeness towards his master,\r\nexpressing the feelings of the household with all the greater freedom\r\nthat he had been in possession of the Rectory since Mr Bury\'s time, and\r\nfelt himself more secure in his tenure than any incumbent, as was\r\nnatural to a man who had already outlived two of these temporary\r\ntenants. Mr Morgan was disposed to be conciliatory when he saw the\r\nstrength of the opposite side.\r\n\r\n"I am a little late today," said the politic Rector. "Mr Leeson was\r\nwith me, and I did not want to bring him home to dinner. It was only\r\non Wednesday he dined with us, and I know you don\'t care for chance\r\nguests."\r\n\r\n"I think it shows a great want of sense in Mr Leeson to think of such\r\na thing," said Mrs Morgan, responding by a little flush of anger to\r\nthe unlucky Curate\'s name. "He might understand that people like to be\r\nby themselves now and then. I am surprised that you give in to him so\r\nmuch as you do, William. Good-nature must stop somewhere, and I think\r\nit is always best to draw a line."\r\n\r\n"I wish it were possible for everybody to draw a line," said the\r\nRector, mysteriously, with a sigh. "I have heard something that has\r\ngrieved me very much to-day. I will tell you about it afterwards."\r\nWhen he had said this, Mr Morgan addressed himself sadly to his\r\ndinner, sighing over it, as if that had something to do with his\r\ndistress.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps, ma\'am," suggested Thomas, who was scarcely on speaking terms\r\nwith his master, "the Rector mayn\'t have heard as Mr Wodehouse has\r\nbeen took very bad again, and aint expected to see out the night."\r\n\r\n"I am very sorry," said the Rector. "Poor ladies! it will come very\r\nhard upon them. My dear, I think you should call and ask if you can do\r\nanything. Troubles never come singly, it is said. I am very sorry for\r\nthat poor young creature; though, perhaps, things have not gone so far\r\nas one imagined." The Rector sighed again, and looked as though his\r\nsecret, whatever it might be, was almost too much for him. The\r\nconsequence, of course, was, that Thomas prolonged his services to the\r\nlast possibility, by way of hearing what had happened; as for Mrs\r\nMorgan, she sat on thorns, though her sense of propriety was too great\r\nto permit her to hurry over the dinner. The pudding, though it was the\r\nRector\'s favourite pudding, prepared from a receipt only known at\r\nAll-Souls, in which the late respected Head of that learned community\r\nhad concentrated all his genius, was eaten in uneasy silence, broken\r\nonly by the most transparent attempts on both sides to make a little\r\nconversation. Thomas hovered sternly over his master and mistress all\r\nthe time, exacting with inexorable severity every usage of the table.\r\nHe would not let them off the very smallest detail, but insisted on\r\nhanding round the peaches, notwithstanding Mrs Morgan\'s protest. "They\r\nare the first out of the new orchard-house," said the Rector\'s wife.\r\n"I want your opinion of them. That will do, Thomas; we have got\r\neverything now, I think." Mrs Morgan was a little anxious about the\r\npeaches, having made a great many changes on her own responsibility in\r\nthe gardening department; but the Rector took the downy fruit as if it\r\nhad been a turnip, and notwithstanding her interest in the\r\nlong-delayed news, his wife could not but find it very provoking that\r\nhe took so little notice of her exertions.\r\n\r\n"Roberts stood out against the new flue as long as he could," said\r\nMrs Morgan. "Mr Proctor took no interest in the garden, and everything\r\nhad gone to ruin; though I must say it was very odd that anybody from\r\n_your_ college, William, should be careless about such a vital\r\nmatter," said the Rector\'s wife, with a little asperity. "I suppose\r\nthere must be something in the air of Carlingford which makes people\r\nindifferent." Naturally, it was very provoking, after all the trouble\r\nshe had taken, to see her husband slicing that juicy pulp as if it had\r\nbeen any ordinary market fruit.\r\n\r\n"I beg your pardon, my dear," said Mr Morgan; "I was thinking of this\r\nstory about Mr Wentworth. One is always making new discoveries of the\r\ncorruption of human nature. He had behaved very badly to me; but it is\r\nvery sad to see a young man sacrifice all his prospects for the\r\nindulgence of his passions; though that is a very secular way of\r\nlooking at the subject," said the Rector, shaking his head mournfully.\r\n"If it is bad in a worldly point of view, what is it in a spiritual?\r\nand in this age, too, when it is so important to keep up the character\r\nof the clergy!" Mr Morgan sighed again more heavily than ever as he\r\npoured out the single glass of port, in which his wife joined him\r\nafter dinner. "Such an occurrence throws a stigma upon the whole\r\nChurch, as Mr Leeson very justly remarked."\r\n\r\n"I thought Mr Leeson must have something to do with it," said the\r\nRector\'s wife. "What has Mr Wentworth been doing? When you keep a\r\nLow-Church Curate, you never can tell what he may say. If he had known\r\nof the All-Souls pudding he would have come to dinner, and we should\r\nhave had it at first-hand," said Mrs Morgan, severely. She put away\r\nher peach in her resentment, and went to a side-table for her work,\r\nwhich she always kept handy for emergencies. Like her husband, Mrs\r\nMorgan had acquired some little "ways" in the long ten years of their\r\nengagement, one of which was a confirmed habit of needlework at all\r\nkinds of unnecessary moments, which much disturbed the Rector when he\r\nhad anything particular to say.\r\n\r\n"My dear, I am very sorry to see you so much the victim of prejudice,"\r\nsaid Mr Morgan. "I had hoped that all our long experiences--" and here\r\nthe Rector stopped short, troubled to see the rising colour in his\r\nwife\'s face. "I don\'t mean to blame you, my dear," said the perplexed\r\nman; "I know you were always very patient;" and he paused, not knowing\r\nwhat more to say, comforting himself with the thought that women were\r\nincomprehensible creatures, as so many men have done before.\r\n\r\n"I am not patient," said the Rector\'s wife; "it never was my nature. I\r\ncan\'t help thinking sometimes that our long experiences have done us\r\nmore harm than good; but I hope nothing will ever make me put up with\r\na Curate who tells tales about other people, and flatters one\'s self,\r\nand comes to dinner without being asked. Perhaps Mr Wentworth is very\r\nsinful, but at least he is a gentleman," said Mrs Morgan; and she bent\r\nher head over her work, and drove her needle so fast through the\r\nmuslin she was at work upon, that it glimmered and sparkled like\r\nsummer lightning before the spectator\'s dazzled eyes.\r\n\r\n"I am sorry you are so prejudiced," said the Rector. "It is a very\r\nunbecoming spirit, my dear, though I am grieved to say so much to you.\r\nMr Leeson is a very good young man, and he has nothing to do with this\r\nterrible story about Mr Wentworth. I don\'t wish to shock your\r\nfeelings--but there are a great many things in the world that one\r\ncan\'t explain to ladies. He has got himself into a most distressing\r\nposition, and a public inquiry will be necessary. One can\'t help\r\nseeing the hand of Providence in it," said the Rector, playing\r\nreflectively with the peach on his plate.\r\n\r\nIt was at this moment that Thomas appeared at the door to announce Mr\r\nLeeson, who had come to talk over the topic of the day with the\r\nRector--being comfortably obtuse in his perceptions, and quite\r\ndisposed to ignore Mrs Morgan\'s general demeanour towards himself. "I\r\nam sure she has a bad temper," he would say to his confidants in the\r\nparish; "you can see it by the redness in her face: but I never take\r\nany notice when she says rude things to me." The redness was alarming\r\nin Mrs Morgan\'s face as the unlucky man became visible at the door.\r\nShe said audibly, "I knew we should be interrupted!" and got up from\r\nher chair. "As Mr Leeson is here, you will not want me, William," she\r\nadded, in her precisest tones. "If anything has happened since you\r\ncame in, he will be able to tell you about it; and perhaps I had\r\nbetter send you your coffee here, for I have a great many things to\r\ndo." Mr Morgan gave a little groan in his spirit as his wife went\r\naway. To do him justice, he had a great deal of confidence in her, and\r\nwas unconsciously guided by her judgment in many matters. Talking it\r\nover with Mr Leeson was a totally different thing; for whatever might\r\nbe said in his defence, there could not be any doubt that the Curate\r\nprofessed Low-Church principles, and had been known to drink tea with\r\nMr Beecher, the new minister of Salem Chapel. "Not that I object to Mr\r\nBeecher because he is a Dissenter," Mr Morgan said, "but because, my\r\ndear, you know, it is a totally different class of society." When the\r\nRector was left alone to discuss parish matters with this doubtful\r\nsubordinate, instead of going into the subject with his wife, the good\r\nman felt a pang of disappointment; for though he professed to be\r\nreluctant to shock her, he had been longing all the time to enter into\r\nthe story, which was certainly the most exciting which had occurred in\r\nCarlingford since the beginning of his incumbency. Mrs Morgan, for her\r\npart, went up-stairs to the drawing-room with so much indignation\r\nabout this personal grievance that she almost forgot her curiosity. Mr\r\nLeeson hung like a cloud over all the advantages of Carlingford; he\r\nput out that new flue in the greenhouse, upon which she was rather\r\ndisposed to pique herself, and withered her ferns, which everybody\r\nallowed to be the finest collection within a ten miles\' circuit. This\r\nsense of disgust increased upon her as she went into the drawing-room,\r\nwhere her eye naturally caught that carpet which had been the first\r\ncross of her married life. When she had laid down her work, she began\r\nto plan how the offensive bouquets might be covered with a pinafore of\r\nlinen, which looked very cool and nice in summer-time. And then the\r\nRector\'s wife reflected that in winter a floor covered with white\r\nlooked chilly, and that a woollen drugget of an appropriate small\r\npattern would be better on the whole; but no such thing was to be had\r\nwithout going to London for it, which brought her mind back again to\r\nMr Leeson and all the disadvantages of Carlingford. These subjects\r\noccupied Mrs Morgan to the exclusion of external matters, as was\r\nnatural; and when she heard the gentlemen stir down-stairs as if with\r\nideas of joining her in the drawing-room, the Rector\'s wife suddenly\r\nrecollected that she had promised some tea to a poor woman in Grove\r\nStreet, and that she could not do better this beautiful evening than\r\ntake it in her own person. She was very active in her district at all\r\ntimes, and had proved herself an admirable clergywoman; but perhaps it\r\nwould not have occurred to her to go out upon a charitable errand that\r\nparticular evening had it not been for the presence of Mr Leeson\r\ndown-stairs.\r\n\r\nIt was such a very lovely night, that Mrs Morgan was tempted to go\r\nfurther than she intended. She called on two or three of her\r\nfavourites in Grove Street, and was almost as friendly with them as\r\nLucy Wodehouse was with the people in Prickett\'s Lane; but being\r\nneither pretty and young, like Lucy, nor yet a mother with a nursery,\r\nqualified to talk about the measles, her reception was not quite as\r\nenthusiastic as it might have been. Somehow it would appear as though\r\nour poor neighbours loved most the ministrations of youth, which is\r\nsuperior to all ranks in the matter of possibility and expectation,\r\nand inferior to all ranks in the matter of experience; and so holds a\r\nkind of balance and poise of nature between the small and the great.\r\nMrs Morgan was vaguely sensible of her disadvantages in this respect\r\nas well as in others. She never could help imagining what she might\r\nhave been had she married ten years before at the natural period.\r\n"And even then not a girl," she said to herself in her sensible way,\r\nas she carried this habitual thread of thought with her along the\r\nstreet, past the little front gardens, where there were so many\r\nmothers with their children. On the other side of the way the genteel\r\nhouses frowned darkly with their staircase windows upon the humility\r\nof Grove Street; and Mrs Morgan began to think within herself of the\r\nMiss Hemmings and other spinsters, and how they got along upon this\r\npath of life, which, after all, is never lightsome to behold, except\r\nin the future or the past. It was dead present with the Rector\'s wife\r\njust then, and many speculations were in her mind, as was natural.\r\n"Not that I could not have lived unmarried," she continued within\r\nherself, with a woman\'s pride; "but things looked so different at\r\nfive-and-twenty!" and in her heart she grudged the cares she had lost,\r\nand sighed over this wasting of her years.\r\n\r\nIt was just then that the youngest Miss Hemmings saw Mrs Morgan, and\r\ncrossed over to speak to her. Miss Hemmings had left five-and-thirty\r\nbehind a long time ago, and thought the Rector\'s wife a happy woman in\r\nthe bloom of youth. When she had discovered conclusively that Mrs\r\nMorgan would not go in to have a cup of tea, Miss Hemmings volunteered\r\nto walk with her to the corner; and it is not necessary to say that\r\nshe immediately plunged into the topic which at that moment engaged\r\nall minds in Carlingford. "If I had not seen it with my own eyes, I\r\nshould not have believed it," said Miss Hemmings. "I should have\r\nthought it a got-up story; not that I ever could have thought it\r\n_impossible_, as you say--for, alas! I know well that without grace\r\nevery wickedness is more than possible--but I saw them with my own\r\neyes, my dear Mrs Morgan; she standing outside, the bold little thing,\r\nand he at the door--as if it was right for a clergyman to open the\r\ndoor like a man-servant--and from that moment to this she has not been\r\nseen by any living creature in Carlingford: who can tell what may have\r\nbeen done with her?" cried the horrified eyewitness. "She has never\r\nbeen seen from that hour!"\r\n\r\n"But that was only twenty-four hours ago," said Mrs Morgan; "she may\r\nhave gone off to visit some of her friends."\r\n\r\n"Ah, my dear Mrs Morgan, twenty-four hours is a long time for a girl\r\nto disappear out of her own home," said Miss Hemmings; "and all her\r\nfriends have been sent to, and no word can be heard of her. I am\r\nafraid it will go very hard with Mr Wentworth; and I am sure it looks\r\nlike a judgment upon him for all his candlesticks and flowers and\r\nthings," she continued, out of breath with the impetuosity of her\r\ntale.\r\n\r\n"Do you think, then, that God makes people sin in order to punish\r\nthem?" said Mrs Morgan, with some fire, which shocked Miss Hemmings,\r\nwho did not quite know how to reply.\r\n\r\n"I do so wish you would come in for a few minutes and taste our tea;\r\nmy sister Sophia was just making it when I came out. We get it from\r\nour brother in Assam, and we think a great deal of it," said Miss\r\nHemmings; "it can\'t possibly be adulterated, you know, for it comes\r\ndirect from his plantation. If you can\'t come in just now, I will send\r\nyou some to the Rectory, and you shall tell us how you like it. We are\r\nquite proud of our tea. My brother has a large plantation, and he\r\nhopes--"\r\n\r\n"Thank you," said Mrs Morgan, "but the Rector will be waiting for me,\r\nand I must go. It must be very nice to have your tea direct from the\r\nplantation; and I hope you will change your mind about Mr Wentworth,"\r\nshe continued, without much regard for punctuation, as she shook hands\r\nat the corner. Mrs Morgan went down a narrow street which led to\r\nGrange Lane, after this interview, with some commotion in her mind.\r\nShe took Mr Wentworth\'s part instinctively, without asking any proofs\r\nof his innocence. The sun was just setting, and St Roque\'s stood out\r\ndark and picturesque against all the glory of the western sky as the\r\nRector\'s wife went past. She could not help thinking of him, in his\r\nyouth and the opening of his career, with a kind of wistful interest.\r\nIf he had married Lucy Wodehouse, and confined himself to his own\r\ndistrict (but then he had no district), Mrs Morgan would have\r\ncontemplated the two, not, indeed, without a certain half-resentful\r\nself-reference and contrast, but with natural sympathy. And now, to\r\nthink of this dark and ugly blot on his fair beginning disturbed her\r\nmuch. When Mrs Morgan recollected that she had left her husband and\r\nhis Curate consulting over this matter, she grew very hot and angry,\r\nand felt humiliated by the thought. Was it her William, her hero, whom\r\nshe had magnified for all these ten years, though not without\r\noccasional twinges of enlightenment, into something great, who was\r\nthus sitting upon his young brother with so little human feeling and\r\nso much middle-aged jealousy? It hurt her to think of it, though not\r\nfor Mr Wentworth\'s sake. Poor Mrs Morgan, though not at all a\r\nsentimental person, had hoarded up her ideal so much after the\r\nordinary date, that it came all the harder upon her when everything\r\nthus merged into the light of common day. She walked very fast up\r\nGrange Lane, which was another habit of her maidenhood not quite in\r\naccord with the habit of sauntering acquired during the same period by\r\nthe Fellow of All-Souls. When Mrs Morgan was opposite Mr Wodehouse\'s,\r\nshe looked across with some interest, thinking of Lucy; and it shocked\r\nher greatly to see the closed shutters, which told of the presence of\r\ndeath. Then, a little farther up, she could see Elsworthy in front of\r\nhis shop, which was already closed, talking vehemently to a little\r\ngroup round the door. The Rector\'s wife crossed the street, to avoid\r\ncoming into contact with this excited party; and, as she went swiftly\r\nalong under the garden-walls, came direct, without perceiving it, upon\r\nMr Wentworth, who was going the opposite way. They were both absorbed\r\nin their own thoughts, the Perpetual Curate only perceiving Mrs Morgan\r\nin time to take off his hat to her as he passed; and, to tell the\r\ntruth, having no desire for any further intercourse. Mrs Morgan,\r\nhowever, was of a different mind. She stopped instantly, as soon as\r\nshe perceived him. "Mr Wentworth, it is getting late--will you walk\r\nwith me as far as the Rectory?" she said, to the Curate\'s great\r\nastonishment. He could not help looking at her with curiosity as he\r\nturned to accompany her. Mrs Morgan was still wearing her wedding\r\nthings, which were not now in their first freshness--not to say that\r\nthe redness, of which she was so painfully sensible, was rather out of\r\naccordance with the orange blossoms. Then she was rather flurried and\r\ndisturbed in her mind; and, on the whole, Mr Wentworth ungratefully\r\nconcluded the Rector\'s wife to be looking her plainest, as he turned\r\nwith very languid interest to see her safely home.\r\n\r\n"A great many things seem to be happening just now," said Mrs Morgan,\r\nwith a good deal of embarrassment; "I suppose the people in\r\nCarlingford are grateful to anybody who gives them something to talk\r\nabout."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know about the gratitude," said the Perpetual Curate; "it is\r\na sentiment I don\'t believe in."\r\n\r\n"You ought to believe in everything as long as you are young," said\r\nMrs Morgan. "I want very much to speak to you, Mr Wentworth; but then\r\nI don\'t know how you will receive what I am going to say."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t tell until I know what it is," said the Curate, shutting\r\nhimself up. He had an expressive face generally, and Mrs Morgan saw\r\nthe shutters put up, and the jealous blinds drawn over the young man\'s\r\ncountenance as clearly as if they had been tangible articles. He did\r\nnot look at her, but kept swinging his cane in his hand, and regarding\r\nthe pavement with downcast eyes; and if the Rector\'s wife had formed\r\nany expectations of finding in the Perpetual Curate an ingenuous young\r\nheart, open to sympathy and criticism, she now discovered her mistake.\r\n\r\n"If I run the risk, perhaps you will forgive me," said Mrs Morgan. "I\r\nhave just been hearing a dreadful story about you; and I don\'t believe\r\nit in the least, Mr Wentworth," she continued, with a little effusion;\r\nfor though she was very sensible, she was only a woman, and did not\r\nrealise the possibility of having her sympathy rejected, and her\r\nfavourable judgment received with indifference.\r\n\r\n"I am much flattered by your good opinion. What was the dreadful\r\nstory?" asked Mr Wentworth, looking at her with careless eyes. They\r\nwere just opposite Elsworthy\'s shop, and could almost hear what he was\r\nsaying, as he stood in the midst of his little group of listeners,\r\ntalking loud and vehemently. The Perpetual Curate looked calmly at him\r\nacross the road, and turned again to Mrs Morgan, repeating his\r\nquestion, "What was the dreadful story?--one gets used to romances,"\r\nhe said, with a composure too elaborate to be real; but Mrs Morgan did\r\nnot think of that.\r\n\r\n"If you don\'t care about it, I need not say anything," said the\r\nRector\'s wife, who could not help feeling affronted. "But I am so\r\nsorry that Mr Morgan and you don\'t get on," she continued, after a\r\nlittle pause. "I have no right to speak; but I take an interest in\r\neverything that belongs to the parish. If you would put a little\r\nconfidence in my husband, things might go on better; but, in the mean\r\ntime, I thought I might say to you, on my own account, that I had\r\nheard this scandal, and that I don\'t believe in it. If you do not\r\nunderstand my motive I can\'t help it," said the Rector\'s wife, who was\r\nnow equally ready for friendship or for battle.\r\n\r\n"Thanks; I understand what you mean," said Mr Wentworth, who had come\r\nto himself. "But will you tell me what it is you don\'t believe in?" he\r\nasked, with a smile which Mrs Morgan did not quite comprehend.\r\n\r\n"I will tell you," she said, with a little quiet exasperation. "I\r\ndon\'t think you would risk your prospects, and get yourself into\r\ntrouble, and damage your entire life, for the sake of any girl,\r\nhowever pretty she might be. Men don\'t do such things for women\r\nnowadays, even when it is a worthy object," said the disappointed\r\noptimist. "And I believe you are a great deal more sensible, Mr\r\nWentworth." There was just that tone of mingled approval and contempt\r\nin this speech which a woman knows how to deliver herself of without\r\nany appearance of feeling; and which no young man, however _blas\xe9_,\r\ncan hear with composure.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps not," he said, with a little heat and a rising colour. "I am\r\nglad you think me so sensible." And then there ensued a pause, upon\r\nthe issue of which depended the question of peace or war between these\r\ntwo. Mr Wentworth\'s good angel, perhaps, dropped softly through the\r\ndusky air at that moment, and jogged his perverse charge with the tip\r\nof a celestial wing. "And yet there might be women in the world for\r\nwhom--" said the Curate; and stopped again. "I daresay you are not\r\nanxious to know my sentiments on the subject," he continued, with a\r\nlittle laugh. "I am sorry you think so badly--I mean so well of me."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think badly of you," said Mrs Morgan, hastily. "Thank you for\r\nwalking with me; and whatever happens, remember that I for one don\'t\r\nbelieve a word of it," she said, holding out her hand. After this little\r\ndeclaration of friendship, the Rector\'s wife returned to the Rectory,\r\nwhere her husband was waiting for her, more than ever prepared to stand\r\nup for Mr Wentworth. She went back to the drawing-room, forgetting all\r\nabout the carpet, and poured out the tea with satisfaction, and made\r\nherself very agreeable to Mr Finial, the architect, who had come to talk\r\nover the restorations. In that moment of stimulation she forgot all her\r\nexperience of her husband\'s puzzled looks, of the half-comprehension\r\nwith which he looked at her, and the depths of stubborn determination\r\nwhich were far beyond the reach of her hastier and more generous spirit,\r\nand so went on with more satisfaction and gaiety than she had felt\r\npossible for a long time, beating her drums and blowing her trumpets, to\r\nthe encounter in which her female forces were so confident of victory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Wentworth went upon his way, after he had parted from Mrs Morgan,\r\nwith a moment\'s gratitude; but he had not gone half-a-dozen steps\r\nbefore that amiable sentiment yielded to a sense of soreness and\r\nvexation. He had almost acknowledged that he was conscious of the\r\nslander against which he had made up his mind to present a blank front\r\nof unconsciousness and passive resistance, and he was angry with\r\nhimself for his susceptibility to this unexpected voice of kindness.\r\nHe was going home, but he did not care for going home. Poor Mrs\r\nHadwin\'s anxious looks of suspicion had added to the distaste with\r\nwhich he thought of encountering again the sullen shabby rascal to\r\nwhom he had given shelter. It was Saturday night, and he had still his\r\nsermon to prepare for the next day; but the young man was in a state\r\nof disgust with all the circumstances of his lot, and could not make\r\nup his mind to go in and address himself to his work as he ought to\r\nhave done. Such a sense of injustice and cruelty as possessed him was\r\nnot likely to promote composition, especially as the pulpit addresses\r\nof the Curate of St Roque\'s were not of a declamatory kind. To think\r\nthat so many years\' work could be neutralised in a day by a sudden\r\nbreath of scandal, made him not humble or patient, but fierce and\r\nresentful. He had been in Wharfside that afternoon, and felt convinced\r\nthat even the dying woman at No. 10 Prickett\'s Lane had heard of Rosa\r\nElsworthy; and he saw, or imagined he saw, many a distrustful\r\ninquiring glance thrown at him by people to whom he had been a kind\r\nof secondary Providence. Naturally the mere thought of the failing\r\nallegiance of the "district" went to Mr Wentworth\'s heart. When he\r\nturned round suddenly from listening to a long account of one poor\r\nfamily\'s distresses, and saw Tom Burrows, the gigantic bargeman, whose\r\nsix children the Curate had baptised in a lump, and whose baby had\r\nbeen held at the font by Lucy Wodehouse herself, looking at him\r\nwistfully with rude affection, and something that looked very much\r\nlike pity, it is impossible to describe the bitterness that welled up\r\nin the mind of the Perpetual Curate. Instead of leaving Wharfside\r\ncomforted as he usually did, he came away wounded and angry, feeling\r\nto its full extent the fickleness of popular sympathy. And when he\r\ncame into Grange Lane and saw the shutters closed, and Mr Wodehouse\'s\r\ngreen door shut fast, as if never more to open, all sources of\r\nconsolation seemed to be shut against him. Even the habit he had of\r\ngoing into Elsworthy\'s to get his newspaper, and to hear what talk\r\nmight be current in Carlingford, contributed to the sense of utter\r\ndiscomfort and wretchedness which overwhelmed him. Men in other\r\npositions have generally to consult the opinion of their equals only;\r\nbut all sorts of small people can plant thorns in the path of a priest\r\nwho has given himself with fervour to the duties of his office. True\r\nenough, such clouds blow by, and sometimes leave behind a sky clearer\r\nthan before; but that result is doubtful, and Mr Wentworth was not of\r\nthe temper to comfort himself with philosophy. He felt ingratitude\r\nkeenly, as men do at eight-and-twenty, even when they have made up\r\ntheir minds that gratitude is a delusion; and still more keenly, with\r\ndeep resentment and indignation, he felt the horrible doubt which had\r\ndiffused itself around him, and seemed to be looking at him out of\r\neverybody\'s eyes. In such a state of mind one bethinks one\'s self of\r\none\'s relations--those friends not always congenial, but whom one\r\nlooks to instinctively, when one is young, in the crisis of life. He\r\nknocked at his aunts\' door almost without knowing it, as he went down\r\nGrange Lane, after leaving Mrs Morgan, with vague sentences of his\r\nsermon floating in his mind through all the imbroglio of other\r\nthoughts. Even aunt Dora\'s foolish affection might have been a little\r\ncomfort at the moment, and he could not but be a little curious to\r\nknow whether they had heard Elsworthy\'s story, and what the\r\npatronesses of Skelmersdale thought of the matter. Somehow, just then,\r\nin the midst of his distresses, a vision of Skelmersdale burst upon\r\nthe Perpetual Curate like a glimpse of a better world. If he could but\r\nescape there out of all this sickening misconception and ingratitude--if\r\nhe could but take Lucy into his protecting arms, and carry her away far\r\nfrom the clouds that were gathering over her path as well as his own.\r\nThe thought found vent in an impatient long-drawn sigh, and was then\r\nexpelled contemptuously from the young man\'s bosom. If a hundred\r\nSkelmersdales were in his power, here, where his honour had been\r\nattacked, it was necessary to remain, in the face of all obstacles, till\r\nit was cleared.\r\n\r\nThe Miss Wentworths had just come up to the drawing-room after dinner\r\nwhen their nephew entered. As for Miss Dora, she had seated herself by\r\nthe window, which was open, and, with her light little curls\r\nfluttering upon her cheek, was watching a tiny puff of smoke by the\r\nside of the great laurel, which indicated the spot occupied at this\r\nmoment by Jack and his cigar. "Dear fellow, he does enjoy the quiet,"\r\nshe said, with a suppressed little sniff of emotion. "To think we\r\nshould be in such a misery about poor dear Frank, and have Jack, about\r\nwhom we have all been so unbelieving, sent to us for a consolation. My\r\npoor brother will be so happy," said Miss Dora, almost crying at the\r\nthought. She was under the influence of this sentiment when the Curate\r\nentered. It was perhaps impossible for Mr Wentworth to present himself\r\nbefore his three aunts at the present crisis without a certain\r\nconsciousness in his looks; and it was well that it was twilight, and\r\nhe could not read distinctly all that was written in their\r\ncountenances. Miss Cecilia held out her lovely old hand to him first\r\nof all. She said, "How do you do, Frank?" which was not very original,\r\nbut yet counted for a good deal in the silence. When he came up to\r\nher, she offered him her sweet old cheek with a look of pity which\r\ntouched, and yet affronted, the Perpetual Curate. He thought it was\r\nthe wisest way to accept the challenge at once.\r\n\r\n"It is very good of you, but you need not be sorry for me," he said, as\r\nhe sat down by her. And then there was a little pause--an awful pause;\r\nfor Miss Wentworth had no further observations to offer, and Miss Dora,\r\nwho had risen up hastily, dropped into her chair again in a disconsolate\r\ncondition, when she saw that her nephew did not take any notice of her.\r\nThe poor little woman sat down with miserable sensations, and did not\r\nfind the comfort she hoped for in contemplation of the smoke of Jack\'s\r\ncigar. After all, it was Frank who was the original owner of Miss Dora\'s\r\naffections. When she saw him, as she thought, in a state of guilt and\r\ntrouble, received with grim silence by the dreaded Leonora, the poor\r\nlady began to waver greatly, divided between a longing to return to her\r\nold allegiance, and a certain pride in the new bonds which bound her to\r\nso great a sinner as Jack. She could not help feeling the distinction of\r\nhaving such a reprobate in her hands. But the sight of Frank brought\r\nback old habits, and Miss Dora felt at her wits\' end, and could not tell\r\nwhat to do.\r\n\r\nAt length Miss Leonora\'s voice, which was decided contralto, broke the\r\nsilence. "I am very glad to see you, Frank," said the strong-minded\r\naunt. "From something we heard, I supposed you had gone away for a\r\ntime, and we were rather anxious about your movements. There are so\r\nmany things going on in the family just now, that one does not know\r\nwhat to think. I am glad to see you are still in Carlingford."\r\n\r\n"I never had the least intention of going away," said Mr Wentworth.\r\n"I can\'t imagine who could tell you so."\r\n\r\n"Nobody told us," said Miss Leonora; "we drew that conclusion from\r\nother things we heard. Dora, give Frank the newspaper with that\r\nparagraph about Gerald. I have prophesied from the very first which\r\nway Gerald was tending. It is very shocking of him, and I don\'t know\r\nwhat they are to do, for Louisa is an expensive little fool; and if he\r\nleaves the Rectory, they can\'t have enough to live on. If you knew\r\nwhat your brother was going to do, why didn\'t you advise him\r\notherwise? Besides, he will be wretched," said the discriminating\r\nwoman. "I never approved of his ways, but I could not say anything\r\nagainst his sincerity. I believe his heart was in his work; a man may\r\nbe very zealous, and yet very erroneous," said Miss Leonora, like an\r\noracle, out of the shadows.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know if he is erroneous or not--but I know I should like to\r\npunch this man\'s head," said the Curate, who had taken the paper to\r\nthe window, where there was just light enough to make out the\r\nparagraph. He stood looming over Miss Dora, a great black shadow\r\nagainst the fading light. "All the mischief in the world comes of\r\nthese villanous papers," said Mr Wentworth. "Though I did not think\r\nanybody nowadays believed in the \'Chronicle.\' Gerald has not gone over\r\nto Rome, and I don\'t think he means to go. I daresay you have agitated\r\nyourselves unnecessarily about more than one supposed event in the\r\nfamily," he continued, throwing the paper on the table. "I don\'t know\r\nanything very alarming that has happened as yet, except, perhaps, the\r\nprodigal\'s return," said the Perpetual Curate, with a slight touch of\r\nbitterness. His eye had just lighted on Jack sauntering through the\r\ngarden with his cigar; and Mr Wentworth was human, and could not\r\nentirely refrain from the expression of his sentiments.\r\n\r\n"But oh, Frank, my dear, you are not angry about poor Jack?" said Miss\r\nDora. "He has not known what it was to be at home for years and years.\r\nA stepmother is so different from an own mother, and he never has had\r\nany opportunities; and oh, Frank, don\'t you remember that there is\r\njoy in heaven?" cried the anxious aunt--"not to say that he is the\r\neldest son. And it is such a thing for the family to see him changing\r\nhis ways in such a beautiful spirit!" said Miss Dora. The room was\r\nalmost dark by this time, and she did not see that her penitent had\r\nentered while she spoke.\r\n\r\n"It is very consoling to gain your approval, aunt Dora," said Jack. "My\r\nbrother Frank doesn\'t know me. If the Squire _will_ make a nursery of\r\nhis house, what can a man do? But a fellow can\'t be quite ruined as long\r\nas he has--" aunts, the reprobate was about to say, with an inflection\r\nof laughter intended for Frank\'s ear only in his voice; but he\r\nfortunately remembered in time that Miss Leonora had an acute\r\nintelligence, and was not to be trifled with--"As long as he has female\r\nrelations," said Jack, in his most feeling tone. "Men never sympathise\r\nwith men." He seemed to be apologising for Frank\'s indifference, as well\r\nas for his own sins. He had just had a very good dinner--for the Miss\r\nWentworths\' cook was the best in Carlingford--and Jack, whose digestion\r\nwas perfect, was disposed to please everybody, and had, in particular,\r\nno disposition to quarrel with Frank.\r\n\r\n"Oh, my dear, you see how humble and forgiving he is," said Miss Dora,\r\nrising on tiptoe to whisper into the Curate\'s ear; "and always takes\r\nyour part whenever you are mentioned," said the injudicious aunt.\r\nMeantime the other sisters were very silent, sitting each in the midst\r\nof her own group of shadows. Then Miss Leonora rose with a sudden\r\nrustling of all her draperies, and with her own energetic hand rang\r\nthe bell.\r\n\r\n"Now the lamp is coming," said Jack, in a tone of despair, "a bright,\r\nblank, pitiless globe like the world; and instead of this delicious\r\ndarkness, where one can see nothing distinctly, my heart will be torn\r\nasunder for the rest of the evening by the sight of suicide. Why do we\r\never have lights?" said the exquisite, laying himself down softly on\r\na sofa. When the lamp was brought in, Jack became visible stretched\r\nout in an attitude of perfect repose and tranquillity, with a quiet\r\nconscience written in every fold of his scrupulous apparel. As for\r\nFrank, on the contrary, he was still in morning dress, and was biting\r\nhis nails, and had a cloud upon his brow which the sudden light\r\ndisclosed like a traitor before he was prepared for it. Between the\r\ntwo brothers such a contrast was visible that it was not surprising if\r\nMiss Dora, still wavering in her allegiance, went back with relief to\r\nthe calm countenance of her penitent, and owned to herself with\r\ntrembling that the Curate looked preoccupied and guilty. Perhaps Miss\r\nLeonora came to a similar conclusion. She seated herself at her\r\nwriting-table with her usual air of business, and made a pen to a hard\r\npoint by the light of the candles, which were sacred to her particular\r\nuse.\r\n\r\n"I heard some news this morning which pleased me very much," said Miss\r\nLeonora. "I daresay you remember Julia Trench? You two used to be a\r\ngreat deal together at one time. She is going to be married to Mr\r\nShirley\'s excellent curate, who is a young man of the highest\r\ncharacter. He did very well at the university, I believe," said the\r\npatroness of Skelmersdale; "but I confess I don\'t care much for\r\nacademical honours. He is an excellent clergyman, which is a great\r\ndeal more to the purpose, and I thoroughly agree with his views. So,\r\nknowing the interest we take in Julia, you may think how pleased we\r\nwere," said Miss Leonora, looking full into her nephew\'s face. He knew\r\nwhat she meant as distinctly as if she had put it in words.\r\n\r\n"When is old Shirley going to die?" said Jack from the sofa. "It\'s\r\nrather hard upon Frank, keeping him out of the living so long; and if\r\nI were you, I\'d be jealous of this model curate," said the fine\r\ngentleman, with a slight civil yawn. "I don\'t approve of model curates\r\nupon family livings. People are apt to make comparisons," said Jack,\r\nand then he raised his head with a little energy--"Ah, there it is,"\r\nsaid the Sybarite, "the first moth. Don\'t be precipitate, my dear\r\nfellow. Aunt Dora, pray sit quietly where you are, and don\'t disturb\r\nour operations. It is only a moth, to be sure; but don\'t let us cut\r\nshort the moments of a creature that has no hereafter," said Jack,\r\nsolemnly. He disturbed them all by this eccentric manifestation of\r\nbenevolence, and flapped his handkerchief round Miss Dora, upon whose\r\nwhite cap the unlucky moth, frightened by its benefactor\'s vehemence,\r\nwas fluttering wildly. Jack even forgot himself so far as to swear\r\nsoftly in French at the frightened insect as it flew wildly off at a\r\ntangent, not to the open window, but to Miss Leonora\'s candles, where\r\nit came to an immediate end. Miss Leonora sat rather grimly looking on\r\nat all this byplay. When her elegant nephew threw himself back once\r\nmore upon his sofa, she glanced from him to his brother with a\r\ncomparison which perhaps was not so much to the disadvantage of the\r\nPerpetual Curate. But even Miss Leonora, though so sensible, had her\r\nweaknesses; and she was very evangelical, and could put up with a\r\ngreat deal from the sinner who had placed himself for conversion in\r\nher hands.\r\n\r\n"We have too great a sense of our responsibility to treat Skelmersdale\r\nsimply as a family living," she said. "Besides, Frank of course is to\r\nhave Wentworth Rectory. Gerald\'s perversion is a great blow; but\r\nstill, if it _is_ to be, Frank will be provided for at least. As for\r\nour parish--"\r\n\r\n"I beg your pardon," said the Curate; "I have not the least intention\r\nof leaving Carlingford. At the present moment neither Skelmersdale nor\r\nWentworth would tempt me. I am in no doubt as to where my work lies,\r\nand there is enough of it to satisfy any man." He could not help\r\nthinking, as he spoke, of ungrateful Wharfside, for which he had done\r\nso much, and the recollection brought a little flush of indignant\r\ncolour to his cheek.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Frank, my dear," said Miss Dora in a whisper, stealing up to him,\r\n"if it is not true, you must not mind. Oh, my dear boy, nobody will\r\nmind it if it is not true." She put her hand timidly upon his arm as\r\nshe reached up to his ear, and at the same time the poor little woman,\r\nwho was trying all she could to serve two masters, kept one eye upon\r\nJack, lest her momentary return to his brother might have a disastrous\r\neffect upon the moral reformation which she was nursing with so much\r\ncare. As for the Curate, he gave her a hasty glance, which very nearly\r\nmade an end of Miss Dora. She retired to her seat with no more courage\r\nto say anything, unable to make out whether it was virtuous reproach\r\nor angry guilt which looked at her so sternly. She felt her headache\r\ncoming on as she sank again upon her chair. If she could but have\r\nstolen away to her own room, and had a good comforting cry in the\r\ndark, it might have kept off the headache; but then she had to be\r\nfaithful to her post, and to look after the reformation of Jack.\r\n\r\n"I have no doubt that a great work might be done in Carlingford," said\r\nMiss Leonora, "if you would take my advice and organise matters\r\nproperly, and make due provision for the lay element. As for Sisters\r\nof Mercy, I never had any belief in them. They only get young\r\nclergymen into mischief," said the strong-minded aunt. "We are going\r\nto have tea, Frank, if you will have some. Poor Mr Shirley has got\r\nmatters into very bad order at Skelmersdale, but things will be\r\ndifferent under the new incumbent, I hope," said Miss Leonora,\r\nshooting a side-glance of keen inspection at the Curate, who bore it\r\nsteadily.\r\n\r\n"I hope he will conduct himself to your satisfaction," said Mr\r\nWentworth, with a bland but somewhat grim aspect, from the window;\r\n"but I can\'t wait for tea. I have still got some of my work to do for\r\nto-morrow; so good-night."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll walk with you, Frank," said his elder brother. "My dear aunts,\r\ndon\'t look alarmed; nothing can happen to me. There are few\r\ntemptations in Grange Lane; and, besides, I shall come back directly.\r\n_I_ cannot do without my tea," said Jack, by way of consoling poor\r\nMiss Dora, who had started with consternation at the proposal. And\r\nthe two brothers went out into the fresh evening air together, their\r\naunt Dora watching them from the window with inexpressible anxiety;\r\nfor perhaps it was not quite right for a clergyman to saunter out of\r\ndoors in the evening with such a doubtful member of society as Jack;\r\nand perhaps Frank, having himself fallen into evil ways, might hinder\r\nor throw obstacles in the way of his brother\'s re-establishment in the\r\npractice of all the virtues. Miss Dora, who had to carry them both\r\nupon her shoulders, and who got no sympathy in the present case from\r\nher hard-hearted sisters, was fain at last to throw a shawl over her\r\nhead and steal out to that summer-house which was built into the\r\ngarden-wall, and commanded Grange Lane from its little window. There\r\nshe established herself in the darkness, an affectionate spy. There\r\nought to have been a moon that night, and accordingly the lamps were\r\nnot lighted at that end of Grange Lane, for the authorities in\r\nCarlingford bore a frugal mind. But the sky had become cloudy, and the\r\nmoon shone only at intervals, which gave a certain character of\r\nmystery and secrecy to the night. Through this uncertain light the\r\nanxious woman saw her two nephews coming and going under the window,\r\napparently in the most eager conversation. Miss Dora\'s anxiety grew to\r\nsuch a height that she opened softly a chink of the window in hopes of\r\nbeing able to hear as well as to see, but that attempt was altogether\r\nunsuccessful. Then, when they had walked about for half an hour, which\r\nlooked like two hours to Miss Dora, who was rapidly taking one of her\r\nbad colds at the half-open window, they were joined by another figure\r\nwhich she did not think she had ever seen before. The excitement was\r\ngrowing tremendous, and the aspect of the three conspirators more and\r\nmore alarming, when the poor lady started with a little scream at a\r\nnoise behind her, and turning round, saw her maid, severe as a\r\npursuing Fate, standing at the door. "After giving me your word as you\r\nwouldn\'t come no more?" said the reproachful despot who swayed Miss\r\nDora\'s soul. After that she had to make the best of her way indoors,\r\nthankful not to be carried to her room and put into hot water, which\r\nwas the original intention of Collins. But it would be impossible to\r\ndescribe the emotions of Miss Dora\'s mind after this glimpse into the\r\nheart of the volcano on which her innocent feet were standing. Unless\r\nit were murder or high treason, what could they have to plot about? or\r\nwas the mysterious stranger a disguised Jesuit, and the whole business\r\nsome terrible Papist conspiracy? Jack, who had been so much abroad,\r\nand Gerald, who was going over to Rome, and Frank, who was in trouble\r\nof every description, got entangled together in Miss Dora\'s disturbed\r\nimagination. No reality could be so frightful as the fancies with\r\nwhich she distracted herself after that peep from the summer-house;\r\nand it would be impossible to describe the indignation of Collins, who\r\nknew that her mistress would kill herself some day, and was aware that\r\nshe, in her own person, would get little rest that night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what is the exact connection between tea and\r\nreformation," said Jack Wentworth, with a wonderful yawn. "When I\r\nconsider that this is all on account of that stupid beast Wodehouse, I\r\nfeel disposed to eat him. By the way, they have got a capital cook; I\r\ndid not think such a _cuisine_ was the sort of thing to be found in\r\nthe bosom of one\'s family, which has meant boiled mutton up to this\r\nmoment, to my uninstructed imagination. But the old ladies are in a\r\nstate of excitement which, I presume, is unusual to them. It appears\r\nyou have been getting into scrapes like other people, though you are\r\na parson. As your elder brother, my dear Frank--"\r\n\r\n"Look here," said the Perpetual Curate; "you want to ask about\r\nWodehouse. I will answer your questions, since you seem to have some\r\ninterest in him; but I don\'t speak of my private affairs to any but my\r\nintimate friends," said Mr Wentworth, who was not in a humour to be\r\ntrifled with.\r\n\r\nThe elder brother shrugged his shoulders. "It is curious to remark the\r\nprogress of the younger members of one\'s family," he said,\r\nreflectively. "When you were a little boy, you took your drubbings\r\ndutifully; but never mind, we\'ve another subject in hand. I take an\r\ninterest in Wodehouse, and so do you--I can\'t tell for what reason.\r\nPerhaps he is one of the intimate friends with whom you discuss your\r\nprivate affairs? but that is a matter quite apart from the subject.\r\nThe thing is that he has to be taken care of--not for his own sake, as\r\nI don\'t need to explain to you," said Jack. "I hear the old fellow\r\ndied today, which was the best thing he could have done, upon the\r\nwhole. Perhaps you can tell me how much he had, and how he has left\r\nit? We may have to take different sides, and the fellow himself is a\r\nsnob; but I should like to understand exactly the state of affairs\r\nbetween you and me as gentlemen," said the heir of the Wentworths.\r\nEither a passing spasm of compunction passed over him as he said the\r\nword, or it was the moon, which had just flung aside the last fold of\r\ncloud and burst out upon them as they turned back facing her. "When we\r\nknow how the affair stands, we can either negotiate or fight," he\r\nadded, puffing a volume of smoke from his cigar. "Really a very fine\r\neffect--that little church of yours comes well against that bit of\r\nsky. It looks like a Constable, or rather it would look like a\r\nConstable, thrusting up that bit of spire into the blue, if it\r\nhappened to be daylight," said Jack, making a tube of his hand, and\r\nregarding the picture with great interest. Miss Dora at her window\r\nbeheld the movement with secret horror and apprehension, and took it\r\nfor some mysterious sign.\r\n\r\n"I know nothing about Mr Wodehouse\'s property," said the Curate: "I\r\nwish I knew enough law to understand it. He has left no will, I\r\nbelieve;" and Mr Wentworth watched his brother\'s face with no small\r\ninterest as he spoke.\r\n\r\n"Very like a Constable," said Jack, still with his hands to his eyes.\r\n"These clouds to the right are not a bad imitation of some effects of\r\nhis. I beg your pardon, but Constable is my passion. And so old\r\nWodehouse has left no will? What _has_ he left? some daughters? Excuse\r\nmy curiosity," said the elder brother. "I am a man of the world, you\r\nknow. If you like this other girl well enough to compromise yourself\r\non her account (which, mind you, I think a great mistake), you can\'t\r\nmean to go in at the same time for that pretty sister, eh? It\'s a sort\r\nof sport I don\'t attempt myself--though it may be the correct thing\r\nfor a clergyman, for anything I can tell to the contrary," said the\r\ntolerant critic.\r\n\r\nMr Wentworth had swallowed down the interruptions that rushed to his\r\nlips, and heard his brother out with unusual patience. After all,\r\nperhaps Jack was the only man in the world whom he could ask to advise\r\nhim in such an emergency. "I take it for granted that you don\'t mean\r\nto insult either me or my profession," he said, gravely; "and, to tell\r\nthe truth, here is one point upon which I should be glad of your help.\r\nI am convinced that it is Wodehouse who has carried away this\r\nunfortunate girl. She is a little fool, and he has imposed upon her.\r\nIf you can get him to confess this, and to restore her to her friends,\r\nyou will lay me under the deepest obligation," said the Perpetual\r\nCurate, with unusual energy. "I don\'t mind telling you that such a\r\nslander disables me, and goes to my heart." When he had once begun to\r\nspeak on the subject, he could not help expressing himself fully; and\r\nJack, who had grown out of acquaintance with the nobler sentiments,\r\nwoke up with a slight start through all his moral being to recognise\r\nthe thrill of subdued passion and scorn and grief which was in his\r\nbrother\'s voice. Innocent Miss Dora, who knew no evil, had scarcely a\r\ndoubt in _her_ mind that Frank was guilty; but Jack, who scarcely knew\r\nwhat goodness was, acquitted his brother instantaneously, and required\r\nno other proof. Perhaps if he had been capable of any impression\r\nbeyond an intellectual one, this little incident might, in Miss Dora\'s\r\nown language, have "done him good."\r\n\r\n"So you have nothing to do with it?" he said, with a smile. "Wodehouse!\r\nbut then the fellow hasn\'t a penny. I see some one skulking along under\r\nthe walls that looks like him. Hist! Smith--Tom--what do they call you?\r\nWe want you here," said Jack, upon whom the moon was shining full. When\r\nhe stood in his evening coat and spotless breadth of linen, the heir of\r\nthe Wentworths was ready to meet the eye of all the world. His shabby\r\nsubordinate stopped short, with a kind of sullen admiration, to look at\r\nhim. Wodehouse knew the nature of Jack Wentworth\'s pursuits a great deal\r\nbetter than his brother did, and that some of them would not bear much\r\ninvestigation; but when he saw him stand triumphant in gorgeous apparel,\r\nfearing no man, the poor rascal, whom everybody kicked at, rose superior\r\nto his own misfortunes. He had not made much of it in his own person,\r\nbut that life was not altogether a failure which had produced Jack\r\nWentworth. He obeyed his superior\'s call with instinctive fidelity,\r\nproud, in spite of himself, to be living the same life and sharing the\r\nsame perils. When he emerged into the moonlight, his shaggy countenance\r\nlooked excited and haggard. Notwithstanding all his experiences, he was\r\nnot of a constitution which could deny nature. He had inflicted every\r\nkind of torture upon his father while living; but, notwithstanding, the\r\nfact of the death affected him. His eyes looked wilder than usual, and\r\nhis face older and more worn, and he looked round him with a kind of\r\nclandestine skulking instinct as he came out of the shadow into the\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nThis was the terrible conjunction which Miss Dora saw from her window.\r\nThe anxious woman did not wait long enough to be aware that the Curate\r\nleft the other two to such consultations as were inevitable between\r\nthem, and went away very hastily to his own house, and to the work which\r\nstill awaited him--"When the wicked man turneth away from the evil of\r\nhis ways, and doeth that which is lawful and right." Mr Wentworth, when\r\nhe came back to it, sat for about an hour over his text before he wrote\r\na single syllable. His heart had been wrung that day by the sharpest\r\npangs which can be inflicted upon a proud and generous spirit. He was\r\ndisposed to be bitter against all the world--against the dull eyes that\r\nwould not see, the dull ears that could shut themselves against all\r\nsuggestions either of gratitude or justice. It appeared to him, on the\r\nwhole, that the wicked man was every way the best off in this world,\r\nbesides being wooed and besought to accept the blessings of the other.\r\nAnd the Curate was conscious of an irrepressible inclination to\r\nexterminate the human vermin who made the earth such an imbroglio of\r\ndistress and misery; and was sore and wounded in his heart to feel how\r\nhis own toils and honest purposes availed him nothing, and how all the\r\ninterest and sympathy of bystanders went to the pretender. These\r\nsentiments naturally complicated his thoughts, and made composition\r\ndifficult; not to say that they added a thrill of human feeling warmer\r\nthan usual to the short and succinct sermon. It was not an emotional\r\nsermon, in the ordinary sense of the word; but it was so for Mr\r\nWentworth, who carried to an extreme point the Anglican dislike for\r\npulpit exaggeration in all forms. The Perpetual Curate was not a natural\r\norator. He had very little of the eloquence which gave Mr Vincent so\r\nmuch success in the Dissenting connection during his short stay in\r\nCarlingford, which was a kind of popularity not much to the taste of the\r\nChurchman. But Mr Wentworth had a certain faculty of concentrating his\r\nthoughts into the tersest expression, and of uttering in a very few\r\nwords, as if they did not mean anything particular, ideas which were\r\nalways individual, and often of distinct originality--a kind of\r\nutterance which is very dear to the English mind. As was natural, there\r\nwere but a limited amount of people able to find him out; but those who\r\ndid so were rather fond of talking about the "restrained power" of the\r\nCurate of St Roque\'s.\r\n\r\nNext morning was a glorious summer Sunday--one of those days of peace\r\non which this tired old earth takes back her look of innocence, and\r\ndeludes herself with thoughts of Eden. To be sure, there were tumults\r\nenough going on over her surface--vulgar merry-makings and noises,\r\nFrench drums beating, all kinds of discordant sounds going on here and\r\nthere, by land and sea, under that tranquil impartial sun. But the air\r\nwas very still in Carlingford, where you could hear the bees in the\r\nlime-blossoms as you went to church in the sunshine. All that world of\r\nsoft air in which the embowered houses of Grange Lane lay beatified,\r\nwas breathing sweet of the limes; but notwithstanding the radiance of\r\nthe day, people were talking of other subjects as they came down under\r\nthe shadow of the garden-walls to St Roque\'s. There was a great stream\r\nof people--greater than usual; for Carlingford was naturally anxious\r\nto see how Mr Wentworth would conduct himself in such an emergency. On\r\none side of the way Mr Wodehouse\'s hospitable house, shut up closely,\r\nand turning all its shuttered windows to the light, which shone\r\nserenely indifferent upon the blank frames, stood silent, dumbly\r\ncontributing its great moral to the human holiday; and on the other,\r\nElsworthy\'s closed shop, with the blinds drawn over the cheerful\r\nwindows above, where little Rosa once amused herself watching the\r\npassengers, interposed a still more dreadful discordance. The\r\nCarlingford people talked of both occurrences with composure as they\r\nwent to St Roque\'s. They were sorry, and shocked, and very curious;\r\nbut that wonderful moral atmosphere of human indifference and\r\nself-regard which surrounds every individual soul, kept their feelings\r\nquite within bounds. Most people wondered much what Mr Wentworth\r\nwould say; whether he would really venture to face the Carlingford\r\nworld; whether he would take refuge in a funeral sermon for Mr\r\nWodehouse; or how it was possible for him to conduct himself under\r\nsuch circumstances. When the greater part of the congregation was\r\nseated, Miss Leonora Wentworth, all by herself, in her iron-grey silk,\r\nwhich rustled like a breeze along the narrow passage, although she\r\nwore no crinoline, went up to a seat immediately in front, close to Mr\r\nWentworth\'s choristers, who just then came trooping in in their white\r\nsurplices, looking like angels of unequal height and equivocal\r\nreputation. Miss Leonora placed herself in the front row of a little\r\ngroup of benches arranged at the side, just where the Curate\'s wife\r\nwould have been placed, had he possessed such an appendage. She looked\r\ndown blandly upon the many lines of faces turned towards her,\r\naccepting their inspection with perfect composure. Though her\r\nprinciples were Evangelical, Miss Leonora was still a Wentworth, and a\r\nwoman. She had not shown any sympathy for her nephew on the previous\r\nnight; but she had made up her mind to stand by him, without saying\r\nanything about her determination. This incident made a great\r\nimpression on the mind of Carlingford. Most likely it interfered with\r\nthe private devotions, from which a few heads popped up abruptly as\r\nshe passed; but she was very devout and exemplary in her own person,\r\nand set a good example, as became the clergyman\'s aunt.\r\n\r\nExcitement rose very high in St Roque\'s when Mr Wentworth came into the\r\nreading-desk, and Elsworthy, black as a cloud, became visible\r\nunderneath. The clerk had not ventured to absent himself, nor to send a\r\nsubstitute in his place. Never, in the days when he was most devoted to\r\nMr Wentworth, had Elsworthy been more determined to accompany him\r\nthrough every particular of the service. They had stood together in the\r\nlittle vestry, going through all the usual preliminaries, the Curate\r\ntrying hard to talk as if nothing had happened, the clerk going through\r\nall his duties in total silence. Perhaps there never was a church\r\nservice in Carlingford which was followed with such intense interest by\r\nall the eyes and ears of the congregation. When the sermon came, it took\r\nMr Wentworth\'s admirers by surprise, though they could not at the moment\r\nmake out what it was that puzzled them. Somehow the perverse manner in\r\nwhich for once the Curate treated that wicked man who is generally made\r\nso much of in sermons, made his hearers slightly ashamed of themselves.\r\nAs for Miss Leonora, though she could not approve of his sentiments, the\r\nthought occurred to her that Frank was not nearly so like his mother\'s\r\nfamily as she had supposed him to be. When the service was over, she\r\nkept her place, steadily watching all the worshippers out, who thronged\r\nout a great deal more hastily than usual to compare notes, and ask each\r\nother what they thought. "I can\'t fancy he looks guilty," an eager voice\r\nhere and there kept saying over and over. But on the whole, after they\r\nhad got over the momentary impression made by his presence and aspect,\r\nthe opinion of Carlingford remained unchanged; which was--that,\r\nnotwithstanding all the evidence of his previous life, it was quite\r\nbelievable that Mr Wentworth was a seducer and a villain, and ought to\r\nbe brought to condign punishment; but that in the mean time it was very\r\ninteresting to watch the progress of this startling little drama; and\r\nthat he himself, instead of merely being the Curate of St Roque\'s, had\r\nbecome a most captivating enigma, and had made church-going itself half\r\nas good as a play.\r\n\r\nAs for Miss Leonora, she waited for her nephew, and, when he was ready,\r\ntook his arm and walked with him up Grange Lane to her own door, where\r\nthey encountered Miss Wentworth and Miss Dora returning from church, and\r\noverwhelmed them with astonishment. But it was not about his own affairs\r\nthat they talked. Miss Leonora did not say a word to her nephew about\r\nhimself. She was talking of Gerald most of the time, and inquiring into\r\nall the particulars of the Squire\'s late "attack." And she would very\r\nfain have found out what Jack\'s motive was in coming to Carlingford; but\r\nas for Rosa Elsworthy and her concerns, the strong-minded woman ignored\r\nthem completely. Mr Wentworth even went with her to lunch, on her urgent\r\ninvitation; and it was from his aunts\' house that he took his way to\r\nWharfside, pausing at the green door to ask after the Miss Wodehouses,\r\nwho were, John said, with solemnity, as well as could be expected. They\r\nwere alone, and they did not feel equal to seeing anybody--even Mr\r\nWentworth; and the Perpetual Curate, who would have given all he had in\r\nthe world for permission to soothe Lucy in her sorrow, went away sadly\r\nfrom the hospitable door, which was now for the first time closed to\r\nhim. He could not go to Wharfside, to the "district" through which they\r\nhad so often gone together, about which they had talked, when all the\r\nlittle details discussed were sweet with the love which they did not\r\nname, without going deeper and deeper into that sweet shadow of Lucy\r\nwhich was upon his way wherever he went. He could not help missing her\r\nvoice when the little choir, which was so feeble without her, sang the\r\n\'Magnificat,\' which, somehow, Mr Wentworth always associated with her\r\nimage. He read the same sermon to the Wharfside people which he had\r\npreached in St Roque\'s, and saw, with a little surprise, that it drew\r\ntears from the eyes of his more open-hearted hearers, who did not think\r\nof the proprieties. He could see their hands stealing up to their faces,\r\nand a great deal of persistent winking on the part of the stronger\r\nmembers of the congregation. At the close of the service Tom Burrows\r\ncame up to the Curate with a downcast countenance. "Please, sir, if I\'ve\r\ndone ye injustice in my own mind, as went sore against the grain, and\r\nwouldn\'t have happened but for the women, I axes your pardon," said the\r\nhonest bargeman, which was balm and consolation to Mr Wentworth. There\r\nwas much talk in Prickett\'s Lane on the subject as he went to see the\r\nsick woman in No. 10. "There aint no doubt as he sets our duty before\r\nus clear," said one family mother; "he don\'t leave the men no excuse for\r\ntheir goings-on. He all but named the Bargeman\'s Arms out plain, as it\r\nwas the place all mischief comes from." "If he\'d have married Miss Lucy,\r\nlike other folks, at Easter," said one of the brides whom Mr Wentworth\r\nhad blessed, "such wicked stories couldn\'t never have been made up." "A\r\nstory may be made up, or it mayn\'t be made up," said a more experienced\r\nmatron; "but it can\'t be put out of the world unbeknowst no more nor a\r\nbabby. I don\'t believe in stories getting up that aint true. I don\'t say\r\nas he don\'t do his duty; but things was different in Mr Bury\'s time, as\r\nwas the real Rector; and, as I was a-saying, a tale\'s like a babby--it\r\nmay come when it didn\'t ought to come, or when it aint wanted, but you\r\ncan\'t do away with it, anyhow as you like to try." Mr Wentworth did not\r\nhear this dreary prediction as he went back again into the upper world.\r\nHe was in much better spirits, on the whole. He had calmed his own mind\r\nand moved the hearts of others, which is to every man a gratification,\r\neven though nothing higher should be involved. And he had regained the\r\nmoral countenance of Tom Burrows, which most of all was a comfort to\r\nhim. More than ever he longed to go and tell Lucy as he passed by the\r\ngreen door. Tom Burrows\'s repentant face recalled Mr Wentworth\'s mind to\r\nthe fact that a great work was doing in Wharfside, which, after all, was\r\nmore worth thinking of than any tantalising vision of an impossible\r\nbenefice. But this very thought, so consoling in itself, reminded him of\r\nall his vexations, of the public inquiry into his conduct which was\r\nhanging over him, and of his want of power to offer to Lucy the support\r\nand protection of which she might so soon stand in need; and having thus\r\ndrawn upon his head once more his whole burden of troubles, Mr Wentworth\r\nwent in to eat his dinner with what appetite he could.\r\n\r\nThe Perpetual Curate sat up late that night, as indeed was his\r\ncustom. He sat late, hearing, as everybody does who sits up alone in a\r\nhushed and sleeping household, a hundred fantastic creaks and sounds\r\nwhich did not mean anything, and of which he took no notice. Once,\r\nindeed, when it was nearly midnight, he fancied he heard the\r\ngarden-gate close hurriedly, but explained it to himself as people do\r\nwhen they prefer not to give themselves trouble. About one o\'clock in\r\nthe morning, however, Mr Wentworth could no longer be in any doubt\r\nthat some stealthy step was passing his door and moving about the\r\nhouse. He was not alarmed, for Mrs Hadwin had occasional "attacks,"\r\nlike most people of her age; but he put down his pen and listened. No\r\nother sound was to be heard except this stealthy step, no opening of\r\ndoors, nor whisper of voices, nor commotion of any kind; and after a\r\nwhile Mr Wentworth\'s curiosity was fully awakened. When he heard it\r\nagain, he opened his door suddenly, and threw a light upon the\r\nstaircase and little corridor into which his room opened. The figure\r\nhe saw there startled him more than if it had been a midnight robber.\r\nIt was only Sarah, the housemaid, white and shivering with terror, who\r\nfell down upon her knees before him. "Oh, Mr Wentworth, it aint my\r\nfault!" cried Sarah. The poor girl was only partially dressed, and\r\ntrembled pitifully. "They\'ll say it was my fault; and oh, sir, it\'s my\r\ncharacter I\'m a-thinking of," said Sarah, with a sob; and the Curate\r\nsaw behind her the door of Wodehouse\'s room standing open, and the\r\nmoonlight streaming into the empty apartment. "I daren\'t go\r\ndown-stairs to see if he\'s took anything," cried poor Sarah, under her\r\nbreath; "there might be more of them about the place. But oh, Mr\r\nWentworth, if Missis finds out as I gave him the key, what will become\r\nof me?" Naturally, it was her own danger which had most effect upon\r\nSarah. Her full, good-humoured face was all wet and stained with\r\ncrying, her lips quivering, her eyes dilated. Perhaps a thrill of\r\nprivate disappointment mingled with her dread of losing her character.\r\n"He used to tell me all as he was a-going to do," said Sarah; "but,\r\noh, sir, he\'s been and gone away, and I daren\'t go down-stairs to look\r\nat the plate, and I\'ll never more sleep in quiet, if I was to live a\r\ncentury. It aint as I care for _him_, but it\'s the key and my\r\ncharacter as I\'m a-thinking of," cried the poor girl, bursting into\r\naudible sobs that could be restrained no longer. Mr Wentworth took a\r\ncandle and went into Wodehouse\'s empty room, leaving her to recover\r\nher composure. Everything was cleared and packed up in that apartment.\r\nThe little personal property he had, the shabby boots and worn\r\nhabiliments, had disappeared totally; even the rubbish of wood-carving\r\non his table was cleared away. Not a trace that he had been there a\r\nfew hours ago remained in the place. The Curate came out of the room\r\nwith an anxious countenance, not knowing what to make of it. And by\r\nthis time Sarah\'s sobs had roused Mrs Hadwin, who stood, severe and\r\nindignant, at her own door in her nightcap, to know what was the\r\nmatter. Mr Wentworth retired into his own apartments after a word of\r\nexplanation, leaving the mistress and maid to fight it out. He himself\r\nwas more disturbed and excited than he could have described. He could\r\nnot tell what this new step meant, but felt instinctively that it\r\ndenoted some new development in the tangled web of his own fortunes.\r\nSome hidden danger seemed to him to be gathering in the air over the\r\nhouse of mourning, of which he had constituted himself a kind of\r\nguardian. He could not sleep all night, but kept starting at every\r\nsound, thinking now that the skulking rascal, who was Lucy\'s brother,\r\nwas coming back, and now that his departure was only a dream. Mr\r\nWentworth\'s restlessness was not soothed by hearing all the night\r\nthrough, in the silence of the house, suppressed sobs and sounds of\r\nweeping proceeding from the attic overhead, which poor Sarah shared\r\nwith her fellow-servant. Perhaps the civilities of "the gentleman" had\r\ndazzled Sarah, and been too much for her peace of mind; perhaps it was\r\nonly her character, as the poor girl said. But as often as the Curate\r\nstarted from his uneasy and broken snatches of sleep, he heard the\r\nmurmur of crying and consoling up-stairs. Outside the night was\r\nspreading forth those sweetest unseen glories of the starlight and the\r\nmoonlight and the silence, which Nature reserves for her own\r\nenjoyment, when the weary human creatures are out of the way and at\r\nrest;--and Jack Wentworth slept the sleep of the righteous, uttering\r\ndelicate little indications of the depth of his slumber, which it\r\nwould have been profane to call by any vulgar name. _He_ slept sweetly\r\nwhile his brother watched and longed for daylight, impatient for the\r\nmorrow which must bring forth something new. The moonlight streamed\r\nfull into the empty room, and made mysterious combinations of the\r\nfurniture, and chased the darkness into corners which each held their\r\nsecret. This was how Mrs Hadwin\'s strange lodger, whom nobody could\r\never make out, disappeared as suddenly as he had come, without any\r\nexplanations; and only a very few people could ever come to understand\r\nwhat he had to do with the after-events which struck Grange Lane dumb,\r\nand turned into utter confusion all the ideas and conclusions of\r\nsociety in Carlingford.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\n\r\n"I will do what I can for you," said Mr Morgan; "yours is a very hard\r\ncase, as you say. Of course it would not do for me to give any\r\nopinion--but such a thing shall not occur in Carlingford, while I am\r\nhere, without being looked into," said the Rector, with dignity; "of\r\nthat you may be sure."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want no more nor justice," said Elsworthy--"no more nor\r\njustice. I\'m a man as has always been respected, and never interfered\r\nwith nobody as didn\'t interfere with me. The things I\'ve stood from\r\nmy clergyman, I wouldn\'t have stood from no man living. The way as\r\nhe\'d talk, sir, of them as was a deal better than himself! We was a\r\nhappy family afore Mr Wentworth came nigh of us. Most folks in\r\nCarlingford knows me. There wasn\'t a more industrious family in\r\nCarlingford, though I say it as shouldn\'t, nor one as was more\r\ncontent, or took things more agreeable, afore Mr Wentworth come to put\r\nall wrong."\r\n\r\n"Mr Wentworth has been here for five years," said the Rector\'s wife,\r\nwho was present at this interview; "have things been going wrong for\r\nall that time?"\r\n\r\n"I couldn\'t describe to nobody what I\'ve put up with," said the clerk\r\nof St Roque\'s, evading the question. "He hadn\'t the ways of such\r\nclergymen as I\'ve been used to. Twice the pay wouldn\'t have made up\r\nfor what I\'ve suffered in my feelings; and I ask you, sir, is this how\r\nit\'s all to end? My little girl\'s gone," cried Elsworthy, rising into\r\nhoarse earnestness--"my little girl as was so sweet, and as everybody\r\ntook notice on. She\'s gone, and I don\'t know as I\'ll ever see her\r\nagain; and I can\'t get no satisfaction one way or another; and I ask\r\nyou, sir, is a villain as could do such a thing to hold up his head in\r\nthe town, and go on the same as ever? I aint a man as is contrairy, or\r\nas goes agin\' my superiors; but it\'s driving me mad, that\'s what it\'s\r\ndoing," said Elsworthy, wiping the moisture from his forehead. The man\r\nwas trembling and haggard, changed even in his looks--his eyes were\r\nred with passion and watching, and looked like the eyes of a wild\r\nbeast lying in wait for its prey. "I can\'t say as I\'ve ever slept an\r\nhour since it happened," he cried; "and as for my missis, it\'s\r\na-killing of her. We aint shut up, because we\'ve got to live all the\r\nsame; and because, if the poor thing come back, there\'s always an open\r\ndoor. But I\'ll have justice, if I was to die for it!" cried Elsworthy.\r\n"I don\'t ask no more than justice. If it aint to be had one way, I\'ll\r\nhave it another. I\'ll set the police on him--I will. When a man\'s\r\ndrove wild, he aint answerable for what he\'s a-doing; and to see him\r\na-walking about Carlingford, and a-holding up his head, is a thing as\r\nI won\'t stand no longer, not if it was to be my ruin. I\'m as good as\r\nruined now, and I don\'t care." He broke off short with these words,\r\nand sat down abruptly on the chair Thomas had placed for him in front\r\nof the Rector\'s table. Up to this moment he had been standing, in his\r\nvehemence and agitation, without taking advantage of the courtesy\r\naccorded to his misfortune; now the poor man sat down by way of\r\nemphasis, and began to polish his hat round and round with his\r\ntrembling hands.\r\n\r\nAs for Mr Morgan, he, on the contrary, got up and walked instinctively\r\nto the fireplace, and stood there with his back to the empty grate,\r\ncontemplating the world in general with a troubled countenance, as was\r\nusual. Not to speak of his prejudice against Mr Wentworth, the Rector\r\nwas moved by the sight of Elsworthy\'s distress; but then his wife, who\r\nunluckily had brought her needlework into the library on this particular\r\nmorning, and who was in the interest of the Curate of St Roque\'s, was\r\nseated watchful by the window, occasionally looking up, and entirely\r\ncognisant, as Mr Morgan was aware, of everything that happened. The\r\nRector was much embarrassed to feel himself thus standing between the\r\ntwo parties. "Yours is a very hard case--but it is necessary to proceed\r\nwith caution, for, after all, there is not much proof," he said,\r\nfaltering a little. "My dear, it is a pity to detain you from your\r\nwalk," Mr Morgan continued, after a momentary pause, and looked with a\r\nflush of consciousness at his wife, whose absence would have been such a\r\nrelief to him. Mrs Morgan looked up with a gracious smile.\r\n\r\n"You are not detaining me, William--I am very much interested," said\r\nthe designing woman, and immediately began to arrange and put in order\r\nwhat the Rector knew by experience to be a long piece of work, likely\r\nto last her an hour at least. Mr Morgan uttered a long breath, which\r\nsounded like a little snort of despair.\r\n\r\n"It is very difficult to know what to do," said the Rector, shifting\r\nuneasily upon the hearthrug, and plunging his hands into the depths of\r\nhis pockets. "If you could name anybody you would like to refer it\r\nto--but being a brother clergyman--"\r\n\r\n"A man as conducts himself like that, didn\'t ought to be a clergyman,\r\nsir," cried Elsworthy. "I\'m one as listened to him preaching on Sunday,\r\nand could have jumped up and dragged him out of the pulpit, to hear him\r\na-discoursing as if he wasn\'t a bigger sinner nor any there. I aint safe\r\nto stand it another Sunday. I\'d do something as I should be sorry for\r\nafter. I\'m asking justice, and no more." With these words Elsworthy got\r\nup again, still turning round in his hands the unlucky hat, and turned\r\nhis person, though not his eyes, towards Mrs Morgan. "No man could be\r\nmore partial to his clergyman nor I was," he said hoarsely. "There was\r\nnever a time as I wasn\'t glad to see him. He came in and out as if it\r\nbelonged to him, and I had no more thought as he was meaning any harm\r\nthan the babe unborn; but a man as meddles with an innocent girl aint\r\nnothing but a black-hearted villain!" cried Elsworthy, with a gleam out\r\nof his red eyes; "and I don\'t believe as anybody would take his part as\r\nknew all. I put my confidence in the Rector, as is responsible for the\r\nparish," he went on, facing round again: "not to say but what it\'s\r\nnatural for them as are Mr Wentworth\'s friends to take his part--but\r\nI\'ll have justice, wherever it comes from. It\'s hard work to go again\'\r\nany lady as I\'ve a great respect for, and wouldn\'t cross for the world;\r\nbut it aint in reason that I should be asked to bear it and not say\r\nnothing; and I\'ll have justice, if I should die for it," said Elsworthy.\r\nHe turned from one to another as he spoke, but kept his eyes upon his\r\nhat, which he smoothed and smoothed as if his life depended on it. But\r\nfor the reality of his excitement, his red eyes, and hoarse voice, he\r\nwould have been a ludicrous figure, standing as he did in the middle of\r\nMr Morgan\'s library, veering round, first to one side and then to the\r\nother, with his stooping head and ungainly person. As for the Rector, he\r\ntoo kept looking at his wife with a very troubled face.\r\n\r\n"It is difficult for me to act against a brother clergyman," said Mr\r\nMorgan; "but I am very sorry for you, Elsworthy--very sorry; if you\r\ncould name, say, half-a-dozen gentlemen--"\r\n\r\n"But don\'t you think," said the Rector\'s wife, interposing, "that you\r\nshould inquire first whether there is any evidence? It would make you\r\nall look very ridiculous if you got up an inquiry and found no proof\r\nagainst Mr Wentworth. Is it likely he would do such a thing all at\r\nonce without showing any signs of wickedness beforehand--is it\r\npossible? To be sorry is quite a different thing, but I don\'t see--"\r\n\r\n"Ladies don\'t understand such matters," said the Rector, who had been\r\nkept at bay so long that he began to get desperate. "I beg your\r\npardon, my dear, but it is not a matter for you to discuss. We shall\r\ntake good care that there is plenty of evidence," said the perplexed\r\nman--"I mean, before we proceed to do anything," he added, growing\r\nvery red and confused. When Mr Morgan caught his wife\'s eye, he got as\r\nnearly into a passion as was possible for so good a man. "You know\r\nwhat I mean," he said, in his peremptory way; "and, my dear, you will\r\nforgive me for saying this is not a matter to be discussed before a\r\nlady." When he had uttered this bold speech, the Rector took a few\r\nlittle walks up and down the room, not caring, however, to look at his\r\nwife. He was ashamed of the feeling he had that her absence would set\r\nhim much more at ease with Elsworthy, but still could not help being\r\nconscious that it was so. He did not say anything more, but he walked\r\nup and down the room with sharp short steps, and betrayed his\r\nimpatience very manifestly. As for Mrs Morgan, who was a sensible\r\nwoman, she saw that the time had come for her to retire from the\r\nfield.\r\n\r\n"I think the first thing to be done is to try every possible means of\r\nfinding the girl," she said, getting up from her seat; "but I have no\r\ndoubt what you decide upon will be the best. You will find me in the\r\ndrawing-room when you want me, William." Perhaps her absence for the\r\nfirst moment was not such a relief to her husband as he had expected.\r\nThe mildness of her parting words made it very apparent that she did\r\nnot mean to take offence; and he perceived suddenly, at a glance, that\r\nhe would have to tell her all he was going to do, and encounter her\r\ncriticism single-handed, which was rather an appalling prospect to the\r\nRector. Mrs Morgan, for her part, went up-stairs not without a little\r\nvexation, certainly, but with a comforting sense of the opportunity\r\nwhich awaited her. She felt that, in his unprotected position, as soon\r\nas she left him, the Rector would conduct himself rashly, and that her\r\ntime was still to come.\r\n\r\nThe Rector went back to the hearthrug when his wife left the room, but\r\nin the heat of his own personal reflections he did not say anything to\r\nElsworthy, who still stood smoothing his hat in his hand. On the\r\nwhole, Mr Morgan was rather aggravated for the moment by the unlucky\r\ncause of this little encounter, and was not half so well disposed\r\ntowards Mr Wentworth\'s enemy as half an hour before, when he\r\nrecognised his wife as the champion of the Curate, and felt controlled\r\nby her presence; for the human and even the clerical mind has its\r\nimpulses of perversity. He began to get very impatient of Elsworthy\'s\r\nhat, and the persistent way in which he worked at it with his hands.\r\n\r\n"I suppose you would not be so certain about it if you had not\r\nsatisfactory evidence?" he said, turning abruptly, and even a little\r\nangrily, upon the supplicant; for Mr Morgan naturally resented his own\r\ntemper and the little semi-quarrel he had got into upon the third\r\nperson who was the cause of all.\r\n\r\n"Sir," said Elsworthy, with eagerness, "it aint no wonder to me as the\r\nlady takes Mr Wentworth\'s part. A poor man don\'t stand no chance\r\nagainst a young gentleman as has had every advantage. It\'s a thing as\r\nI\'m prepared for, and it don\'t have no effect upon me. A lady as is so\r\nrespected and thought a deal of both in town and country--"\r\n\r\n"I was not speaking of my wife," said the Rector, hastily, "don\'t you\r\nthink you had better put down your hat? I think you said it was on\r\nFriday it occurred. It will be necessary to take down the facts in a\r\nbusiness-like way," said Mr Morgan, drawing his chair towards the table\r\nand taking up his pen. This was how the Rector was occupied when Thomas\r\nannounced the most unexpected of all possible visitors, Mr Proctor, who\r\nhad been Mr Morgan\'s predecessor in Carlingford. Thomas announced his\r\nold master with great solemnity as "the late Rector"--a title which\r\nstruck the present incumbent with a sense of awe not unnatural in the\r\ncircumstances. He jumped up from his chair and let his pen fall out of\r\nhis startled fingers when his old friend came in. They had eaten many a\r\ngood dinner together in the revered hall of All-Souls, and as the\r\nfamiliar countenance met his eyes, perhaps a regretful thought of that\r\nElysium stole across the mind of the late Fellow, who had been so glad\r\nto leave the sacred brotherhood, and marry, and become as other men. He\r\ngave but a few hurried words of surprise and welcome to his visitor, and\r\nthen, with a curious counterpoise of sentiment, sent him up-stairs to\r\nsee "my wife," feeling, even while half envious of him, a kind of\r\nsuperiority and half contempt for the man who was not a Rector and\r\nmarried, but had given up both these possibilities. When he sent him\r\nup-stairs to see "my wife," Mr Morgan looked after the elderly celibate\r\nwith a certain pity. One always feels more inclined to take the simple\r\nview of any matter--to stand up for injured innocence, and to right the\r\nwronged--when one feels one\'s self better off than one\'s neighbours. A\r\nreverse position is apt to detract from the simplicity of one\'s\r\nconceptions, and to suggest two sides to the picture. When Mr Proctor\r\nwas gone, the Rector addressed himself with great devotion to Elsworthy\r\nand his evidence. It could not be doubted, at least, that the man was\r\nin earnest, and believed what he said; and things unquestionably looked\r\nrather ugly for Mr Wentworth. Mr Morgan took down all about the Curate\'s\r\nuntimely visit to Elsworthy on the night when he took Rosa home; and\r\nwhen he came to the evidence of the Miss Hemmings, who had seen the\r\nCurate talking to the unfortunate little girl at his own door the last\r\ntime she was seen in Carlingford, the Rector shook his head with a\r\nprolonged movement, half of satisfaction, half of regret; for, to be\r\nsure, he had made up his mind beforehand who the culprit was, and it was\r\nto a certain extent satisfactory to have his opinion confirmed.\r\n\r\n"This looks very bad, very bad, I am sorry to say," said Mr Morgan;\r\n"for the unhappy young man\'s own sake, an investigation is absolutely\r\nnecessary. As for you, Elsworthy, everybody must be sorry for you.\r\nHave you no idea where he could have taken the poor girl?--that is,"\r\nsaid the uncautious Rector, "supposing that he is guilty--of which I\r\nam afraid there does not seem much doubt."\r\n\r\n"There aint no doubt," said Elsworthy; "there aint nobody else as\r\ncould have done it. Just afore my little girl was took away, sir, Mr\r\nWentworth went off of a sudden, and it was said as he was a-going home\r\nto the Hall. I was a-thinking of sending a letter anonymous, to ask if\r\nit was known what he was after. I read in the papers the other day as\r\nhis brother was a-going over to Rome. There don\'t seem to be none o\'\r\nthem the right sort; which it\'s terrible for two clergymen. I was\r\nthinking of dropping a bit of a note anonymous--"\r\n\r\n"No--no--no," said the Rector, "that would never do; nothing of that\r\nsort, Elsworthy. If you thought it likely she was there, the proper\r\nthing would be to go and inquire; nothing anonymous--no, no; that is a\r\nthing I could not possibly countenance," said Mr Morgan. He pushed\r\naway his pen and paper, and got very red and uncomfortable. If either\r\nof the critics up-stairs, his wife, or his predecessor in the Rectory,\r\ncould but know that he was having an anonymous letter suggested to\r\nhim--that anybody ventured to think him capable of being an accomplice\r\nin such proceedings! The presence of these two in the house, though\r\nthey were most probably at the moment engaged in the calmest abstract\r\nconversation, and totally unaware of what was going on in the library,\r\nhad a great effect upon the Rector. He felt insulted that any man\r\ncould venture to confide such an intention to him almost within the\r\nhearing of his wife. "If I am to take up your case, everything must be\r\nopen and straightforward," said Mr Morgan; while Elsworthy, who saw\r\nthat he had said something amiss, without precisely understanding\r\nwhat, took up his hat as a resource, and once more began to polish it\r\nround and round in his hands.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t mean no harm, sir, I\'m sure," he said; "I don\'t seem to see\r\nno other way o\' finding out; for I aint like a rich man as can go and\r\ncome as he pleases; but I won\'t say no more, since it\'s displeasing to\r\nyou. If you\'d give me the list of names, sir, as you have decided on\r\nto be the committee, I wouldn\'t trouble you no longer, seeing as\r\nyou\'ve got visitors. Perhaps, if the late Rector aint going away\r\ndirectly, he would take it kind to be put on the committee; and he\'s a\r\ngentleman as I\'ve a great respect for, though he wasn\'t not to say the\r\nman for Carlingford," said Elsworthy, with a sidelong look. He began\r\nto feel the importance of his own position as the originator of a\r\ncommittee, and at the head of the most exciting movement which had\r\nbeen for a long time in Carlingford, and could not help being\r\nsensible, notwithstanding his affliction, that he had a distinction to\r\noffer which even the late Rector might be pleased to accept.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think Mr Proctor will stay," said Mr Morgan; "and if he does\r\nstay, I believe he is a friend of Mr Wentworth\'s." It was only after\r\nhe had said this that the Rector perceived the meaning of the words he\r\nhad uttered; then, in his confusion and vexation, he got up hastily\r\nfrom the table, and upset the inkstand in all the embarrassment of\r\nthe moment. "Of course that is all the greater reason for having his\r\nassistance," said Mr Morgan, in his perplexity; "we are all friends of\r\nMr Wentworth. Will you have the goodness to ring the bell? There are\r\nfew things more painful than to take steps against a brother\r\nclergyman, if one did not hope it would be for his benefit in the\r\nend. Oh, never mind the table. Be so good as to ring the bell\r\nagain--louder, please."\r\n\r\n"There aint nothing equal to blotting-paper, sir," said Elsworthy,\r\neagerly. "With a bit o\' blotting-paper I\'d undertake to rub out\r\nink-stains out o\' the finest carpet--if you\'ll permit me. It aint but a\r\nsmall speck, and it\'ll be gone afore you could look round. It\'s twenty\r\ntimes better nor lemon-juice, or them poisonous salts as you\'re always\r\nnervous of leaving about. Look you here, sir, if it aint a-sopping up\r\nbeautiful. There aint no harm done as your respected lady could be put\r\nout about; and I\'ll take the list with me, if you please, to show to my\r\nwife, as is a-breaking her heart at home, and can\'t believe as we\'ll\r\never get justice. She says as how the quality always takes a gentleman\'s\r\npart against us poor folks, but that aint been my experience. Don\'t you\r\ntouch the carpet, Thomas--there aint a speck to be seen when the\r\nblotting-paper\'s cleared away. I\'ll go home, not to detain you no more,\r\nsir, and cheer up the poor heart as is a-breaking," said Elsworthy,\r\ngetting up from his knees where he had been operating upon the carpet.\r\nHe had got in his hand the list of names which Mr Morgan had put down as\r\nreferees in this painful business, and it dawned faintly upon the Rector\r\nfor the moment that he himself was taking rather an undignified position\r\nas Elsworthy\'s partisan.\r\n\r\n"I have no objection to your showing it to your wife," said Mr Morgan;\r\n"but I shall be much displeased if I hear any talk about it, Elsworthy;\r\nand I hope it is not revenge you are thinking of, which is a very\r\nunchristian sentiment," said the Rector, severely, "and not likely to\r\nafford comfort either to her or to you."\r\n\r\n"No, sir, nothing but justice," said Elsworthy, hoarsely, as he backed\r\nout of the room. Notwithstanding this statement, it was with very\r\nunsatisfactory sensations that Mr Morgan went up-stairs. He felt somehow\r\nas if the justice which Elsworthy demanded, and which he himself had\r\nsolemnly declared to be pursuing the Curate of St Roque\'s, was\r\nwonderfully like revenge. "All punishment must be more or less\r\nvindictive," he said to himself as he went up-stairs; but that fact did\r\nnot make him more comfortable as he went into his wife\'s drawing-room,\r\nwhere he felt more like a conspirator and assassin than an English\r\nRector in broad daylight, without a mystery near him, had any right to\r\nfeel. This sensation confused Mr Morgan much, and made him more\r\nperemptory in his manner than ever. As for Mr Proctor, who was only a\r\nspectator, and felt himself on a certain critical eminence, the\r\nsuggestion that occurred to his mind was, that he had come in at the end\r\nof a quarrel, and that the conjugal firmament was still in a state of\r\ndisturbance: which idea acted upon some private projects in the hidden\r\nmind of the Fellow of All-Souls, and produced a state of feeling little\r\nmore satisfactory than that of the Rector of Carlingford.\r\n\r\n"I hope Mr Proctor is going to stay with us for a day or two," said Mrs\r\nMorgan. "I was just saying it must look like coming home to come to the\r\nhouse he used to live in, and which was even furnished to his own\r\ntaste," said the Rector\'s wife, shooting a little arrow at the late\r\nRector, of which that good man was serenely unconscious. All this time,\r\nwhile they had been talking, Mrs Morgan had scarcely been able to keep\r\nfrom asking who could possibly have suggested such a carpet. Mr\r\nProctor\'s chair was placed on the top of one of the big bouquets, which\r\nexpanded its large foliage round him with more than Eastern\r\nprodigality--but he was so little conscious of any culpability of his\r\nown in the matter, that he had referred his indignant hostess to one of\r\nthe leaves as an illustration of the kind of diaper introduced into the\r\nnew window which had lately been put up in the chapel of All-Souls. "A\r\nnaturalistic treatment, you know," said Mr Proctor, with the utmost\r\nserenity; "and some people objected to it," added the unsuspicious man.\r\n\r\n"I should have objected very strongly," said Mrs Morgan, with a little\r\nflush. "If you call that naturalistic treatment, I consider it\r\nperfectly out of place in decoration--of every kind--" Mr Proctor\r\nhappened to be looking at her at the moment, and it suddenly occurred\r\nto him that Miss Wodehouse never got red in that uncomfortable way,\r\nwhich was the only conclusion he drew from the circumstance, having\r\nlong ago forgotten that any connection had ever existed between\r\nhimself and the carpet on the drawing-room in Carlingford Rectory. He\r\naddressed his next observation to Mr Morgan, who had just come in.\r\n\r\n"I saw Mr Wodehouse\'s death in the \'Times,\'" said Mr Proctor, "and I\r\nthought the poor young ladies might feel--at least they might think it\r\na respect--or, at all events, it would be a satisfaction to one\'s\r\nself," said the late Rector, who had got into a mire of explanation.\r\n"Though he was far from being a young man, yet having a young daughter\r\nlike Miss Lucy--"\r\n\r\n"Poor Lucy!" said Mr Morgan. "I hope that wretched fellow, young\r\nWentworth"--and here the Rector came to a dead stop, and felt that he\r\nhad brought the subject most to be avoided head and shoulders into the\r\nconversation, as was natural to an embarrassed man. The consequence\r\nwas that he got angry, as might have been expected. "My dear, you must\r\nnot look at me as you do. I have just been hearing all the evidence.\r\nNo unbiassed mind could possibly come to any other decision," said Mr\r\nMorgan, with exasperation. Now that he had committed himself, he\r\nthought it was much the best thing to go in for it wholly, without\r\nhalf measures, which was certainly the most straightforward way.\r\n\r\n"What has happened to Wentworth?" said Mr Proctor. "He is a young man\r\nfor whom I have a great regard. Though he is so much younger than I\r\nam, he taught me some lessons while I was in Carlingford which I shall\r\nnever forget. If he is in any trouble that I can help him in, I shall\r\nbe very glad to do it, both for his sake and for--" Mr Proctor slurred\r\nover the end of his sentence a little, and the others were occupied\r\nwith their own difficulties, and did not take very much notice--for it\r\nwas difficult to state fully the nature and extent of Mr Wentworth\'s\r\nenormities after such a declaration of friendship. "I met him on my\r\nway here," said the Fellow of All-Souls, "not looking quite as he used\r\nto do. I supposed it might be Mr Wodehouse\'s death, perhaps." All Mr\r\nProctor\'s thoughts ran in that channel of Mr Wodehouse\'s death, which,\r\nafter all, though sad enough, was not so great an event to the\r\ncommunity in general as the late Rector seemed to suppose.\r\n\r\nIt was Mrs Morgan at length who took heart to explain to Mr Proctor\r\nthe real state of affairs. "He has been a very good clergyman for five\r\nyears," said Mrs Morgan; "he might behave foolishly, you know, about\r\nWharfside, but then that was not his fault so much as the fault of the\r\nRector\'s predecessors. I am sure I beg your pardon, Mr Proctor--I did\r\nnot mean that you were to blame," said the Rector\'s wife; "but,\r\nnotwithstanding all the work he has done, and the consistent life he\r\nhas led, there is nobody in Carlingford who is not quite ready to\r\nbelieve that he has run away with Rosa Elsworthy--a common little girl\r\nwithout any education, or a single idea in her head. I suppose she is\r\nwhat you would call pretty," said the indignant woman. "Everybody is\r\njust as ready to believe that he is guilty as if he were a stranger or\r\na bad character." Mrs Morgan stopped in an abrupt manner, because her\r\nquick eyes perceived a glance exchanged between the two gentlemen. Mr\r\nProctor had seen a good deal of the world in his day, as he was fond\r\nof saying now and then to his intimate friends: and he had learned at\r\nthe university and other places that a girl who is "what you would\r\ncall pretty," counts for a great deal in the history of a young man,\r\nwhether she has any ideas in her head or not. He did not, any more\r\nthan the people of Carlingford, pronounce at once on _a priori_\r\nevidence that Mr Wentworth must be innocent. The Curate\'s "consistent\r\nlife" did not go for much in the opinion of the middle-aged Fellow of\r\nAll-Souls, any more than of the less dignified populace. He said,\r\n"Dear me, dear me!" in a most perplexed and distressed tone, while Mrs\r\nMorgan kept looking at him; and looked very much as if he were tempted\r\nto break forth into lamentations over human nature, as Mr Morgan\r\nhimself had done.\r\n\r\n"I wonder what the Miss Wodehouses think of it," he said at last. "One\r\nwould do a great deal to keep them from hearing such a thing; but I\r\nwonder how they are feeling about it," said Mr Proctor--and clearly\r\ndeclined to discuss the matter with Mrs Morgan, who was counsel for\r\nthe defence. When the Rector\'s wife went to her own room to dress for\r\ndinner, it is very true that she had a good cry over her cup of tea.\r\nShe was not only disappointed, but exasperated, in that impatient\r\nfeminine nature of hers. Perhaps if she had been less sensitive, she\r\nwould have had less of that redness in her face which was so great a\r\ntrouble to Mrs Morgan. These two slow middle-aged men, without any\r\nintuitions, who were coming lumbering after her through all kind of\r\nmuddles of evidence and argument, exasperated the more rapid woman. To\r\nbe sure, they understood Greek plays a great deal better than she did;\r\nbut she was penetrated with the liveliest impatience of their dulness\r\nall the same. Mrs Morgan, however, like most people who are in advance\r\nof their age, felt her utter impotence against that blank wall of dull\r\nresistance. She could not make them see into the heart of things as\r\nshe did. She had to wait until they had attacked the question in the\r\northodox way of siege, and made gradual entrance by dint of hard\r\nlabour. All she could do to console herself was, to shed certain hot\r\ntears of indignation and annoyance over her tea, which, however, was\r\nexcellent tea, and did her good. Perhaps it was to show her sense of\r\nsuperiority, and that she did not feel herself vanquished, that, after\r\nthat, she put on her new dress, which was very much too nice to be\r\nwasted upon Mr Proctor. As for Mr Leeson, who came in as usual just in\r\ntime for dinner, having heard of Mr Proctor\'s arrival, she treated him\r\nwith a blandness which alarmed the Curate. "I quite expected you, for\r\nwe have the All-Souls pudding to-day," said the Rector\'s wife, and she\r\nsmiled a smile which would have struck awe into the soul of any curate\r\nthat ever was known in Carlingford.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the afternoon of the same day on which Mr Proctor arrived in\r\nCarlingford that Mr Wentworth received the little note from Miss\r\nWodehouse which was so great a consolation to the Perpetual Curate. By\r\nthat time he had begun to experience humiliations more hard to bear than\r\nanything he had yet known. He had received constrained greetings from\r\nseveral of his most cordial friends; his people in the district, all but\r\nTom Burrows, looked askance upon him; and Dr Marjoribanks, who had never\r\ntaken kindly to the young Anglican, had met him with satirical remarks\r\nin his dry Scotch fashion, which were intolerable to the Curate. In\r\nthese circumstances, it was balm to his soul to have his sympathy once\r\nmore appealed to, and by those who were nearest to his heart. The next\r\nday was that appointed for Mr Wodehouse\'s funeral, to which Mr Wentworth\r\nhad been looking forward with a little excitement--wondering, with\r\nindignant misery, whether the covert insults he was getting used to\r\nwould be repeated even over his old friend\'s grave. It was while this\r\nwas in his mind that he received Miss Wodehouse\'s little note. It was\r\nvery hurriedly written, on the terrible black-edged paper which, to such\r\na simple soul as Miss Wodehouse, it was a kind of comfort to use in the\r\nmoment of calamity. "Dear Mr Wentworth," it said, "I am in great\r\ndifficulty, and don\'t know what to do: come, I beg of you, and tell me\r\nwhat is best. My dear Lucy insists upon going to-morrow, and I can\'t\r\ncross her when her heart is breaking, and I don\'t know what to do.\r\nPlease to come, if it were only for a moment. Dear, dear papa, and all\r\nof us, have always had such confidence in you!" Mr Wentworth was seated,\r\nvery disconsolate, in his study when this appeal came to him: he was\r\nrather sick of the world and most things in it; a sense of wrong\r\neclipsed the sunshine for the moment, and obscured the skies; but it was\r\ncomforting to be appealed to--to have his assistance and his protection\r\nsought once more. He took his hat immediately and went up the sunny\r\nroad, on which there was scarcely a passenger visible, to the closed-up\r\nhouse, which stood so gloomy and irresponsive in the sunshine. Mr\r\nWodehouse had not been a man likely to attract any profound love in his\r\nlifetime, or sense of loss when he was gone; but yet it was possible to\r\nthink, with the kindly, half-conscious delusion of nature, that had _he_\r\nbeen living, he would have known better; and the Curate went into the\r\ndarkened drawing-room, where all the shutters were closed, except those\r\nof the little window in the corner, where Lucy\'s work-table stood, and\r\nwhere a little muffled sunshine stole in through the blind. Everything\r\nwas in terribly good order in the room. The two sisters had been living\r\nin their own apartments, taking their forlorn meals in the little\r\nparlour which communicated with their sleeping chambers, during this\r\nweek of darkness; and nobody had come into the drawing-room except the\r\nstealthy housemaid, who contemplated herself and her new mourning for an\r\nhour at a stretch in the great mirror without any interruption, while\r\nshe made "tidy" the furniture which nobody now disturbed. Into this\r\nsombre apartment Miss Wodehouse came gliding, like a gentle ghost, in\r\nher black gown. She too, like John and the housemaid and everybody\r\nabout, walked and talked under her breath. There was now no man in the\r\nhouse entitled to disturb those proprieties with which a female\r\nhousehold naturally hedges round all the great incidents of life; and\r\nthe affairs of the family were all carried on in a whisper, in\r\naccordance with the solemnity of the occasion--a circumstance which had\r\nnaturally called the ghost of a smile to the Curate\'s countenance as he\r\nfollowed John up-stairs. Miss Wodehouse herself, though she was pale,\r\nand spent half her time, poor soul! in weeping, and had, besides, living\r\nencumbrances to trouble her helpless path, did not look amiss in her\r\nblack gown. She came in gliding without any noise, but with a little\r\nexpectation in her gentle countenance. She was one of the people whom\r\nexperience never makes any wiser; and she could not help hoping to be\r\ndelivered from her troubles this time, as so often before, as soon as\r\nshe should have transferred them to somebody else\'s shoulders, and taken\r\n"advice."\r\n\r\n"Lucy has made up her mind that we are to go to-morrow," said Miss\r\nWodehouse, drying her tears. "It was not the custom in my young days,\r\nMr Wentworth, and I am sure I don\'t know what to say; but I can\'t bear\r\nto cross her, now that she has nobody but me. She was always the best\r\nchild in the world," said the poor lady--"far more comfort to poor\r\ndear papa than I ever could be; but to hear her talk you would think\r\nthat she had never done anything. And oh, Mr Wentworth, if that was\r\nall I should not mind; but we have always kept things a secret from\r\nher; and now I have had a letter, and I don\'t know what it is possible\r\nto do."\r\n\r\n"A letter from your brother?" asked Mr Wentworth, eagerly.\r\n\r\n"From Tom," said the elder sister; "poor, poor Tom! I am sure papa\r\nforgave him at the last, though he did not say anything. Oh, Mr\r\nWentworth, he was such a nice boy once; and if Lucy only knew, and I\r\ncould summon up the courage to tell her, and he would change his ways,\r\nas he promised--don\'t think me fickle or changeable, or look as if I\r\ndidn\'t know my own mind," cried poor Miss Wodehouse, with a fresh flow\r\nof tears; "but oh, Mr Wentworth, if he only would change his ways, as\r\nhe promised, think what a comfort it would be to us to have him at\r\nhome!"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said the Curate, with a little bitterness. Here was another\r\ninstance of the impunities of wickedness. "I think it very likely\r\nindeed that you will have him at home," said Mr Wentworth--"almost\r\ncertain; the wonder is that he went away. Will you tell me where he\r\ndates his letter from? I have a curiosity to know."\r\n\r\n"You are angry," said the anxious sister. "Oh, Mr Wentworth, I know he\r\ndoes not deserve anything else, but you have always been so kind. I\r\nput his letter in my pocket to show you--at least, I am sure I\r\nintended to put it in my pocket. We have scarcely been in this room\r\nsince--since--" and here Miss Wodehouse broke down, and had to take a\r\nlittle time to recover. "I will go and get the letter," she said, as\r\nat last she regained her voice, and hurried away through the partial\r\ndarkness with her noiseless step, and the long black garments which\r\nswept noiselessly over the carpet. Mr Wentworth for his part went to\r\nthe one window which was only veiled by a blind, and comforted himself\r\na little in the sunshine. The death atmosphere weighed upon the young\r\nman and took away his courage. If he was only wanted to pave the way\r\nfor the reception of the rascally brother for whose sins he felt\r\nconvinced he was himself suffering, the consolation of being appealed\r\nto would be sensibly lessened, and it was hard to have no other way of\r\nclearing himself than by criminating Lucy\'s brother, and bringing\r\ndishonour upon her name. While he waited for Miss Wodehouse\'s return,\r\nhe stood by Lucy\'s table, with very little of the feeling which had\r\nonce prompted him to fold his arms so caressingly with an impulse of\r\ntenderness upon the chair which stood beside it. He was so much\r\nabsorbed in his own thoughts that he did not hear at first the sound\r\nof a hesitating hand upon the door, which at length, when repeated,\r\nwent to the Curate\'s heart. He turned round rapidly, and saw Lucy\r\nstanding on the threshold in her profound mourning. She was very pale,\r\nand her blue eyes looked large and full beyond their natural\r\nappearance, dilated with tears and watching; and when they met those\r\nof Mr Wentworth, they filled full like flower-cups with dew; but\r\nbesides this Lucy made no demonstration of her grief. After that\r\nmomentary hesitation at the door, she came in and gave the Curate her\r\nhand. Perhaps it was a kind of defiance, perhaps a natural yearning,\r\nwhich drew her out of her chamber when she heard of his presence; both\r\nsentiments sprang out of the same feeling; and the Curate, when he\r\nlooked at her, bethought himself of the only moment when he had been\r\nable to imagine that Lucy loved him; that moment by her father\'s\r\nbedside, of which the impression had been dulled since then by a crowd\r\nof events, when she looked with such reproach and disappointment and\r\nindignation into his face.\r\n\r\n"I heard you were here," said Lucy, "and I thought you might think it\r\nstrange not to see us both." And then she paused, perhaps finding it\r\nless easy than she thought to explain why she had come. "We ought to\r\nthank you, Mr Wentworth, for your kindness, though I--"\r\n\r\n"You were angry with me," said the Curate. "I know you thought me\r\nheartless; but a man must bear to be misconceived when he has duty to\r\ndo," the young clergyman added, with a swelling heart. Lucy did not\r\nknow the fuller significance of his words; and there was a loftiness\r\nin them which partly affronted her, and set all her sensitive\r\nwoman-pride in arms against him.\r\n\r\n"I beg your pardon," she said, faltering, and then the two stood\r\nbeside each other in silence, with a sense of estrangement. As for\r\nLucy, all the story about Rosa Elsworthy, of which she had not yet\r\nheard the last chapter, rushed back upon her mind. Was it to see\r\nlittle Rosa\'s lover that she had come out of the darkness of her room,\r\nwith a natural longing for sympathy which it was impossible to\r\nrestrain? The tenderness of the instinctive feeling which had moved\r\nher, went back upon her heart in bitterness. That he must have divined\r\nwhy she had come, and scorned her for it, was the mildest supposition\r\nin Lucy\'s mind. She could almost have imagined that he had come on\r\npurpose to elicit this vain exhibition of regard, and triumph over it;\r\nall this, too, when she was in such great trouble and sorrow, and\r\nwanted a little compassion, a little kindness, so much. This was the\r\nstate of mind to which Lucy had come, in five minutes after she\r\nentered the room, when Miss Wodehouse came back with the letter. The\r\nelder sister was almost as much astonished at Lucy\'s presence as if\r\nshe had been the dead inhabitant who kept such state in the darkened\r\nhouse. She was so startled that she went back a step or two when she\r\nperceived her, and hastily put the letter in her pocket, and exclaimed\r\nher sister\'s name in a tone most unlike Miss Wodehouse\'s natural\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n"I came down-stairs because--I mean they told me Mr Wentworth was\r\nhere," said Lucy, who had never felt so weak and so miserable in her\r\nlife, "and I wanted to thank him for all his kindness." It was here\r\nfor the first time that Lucy broke down. Her sorrow was so great, her\r\nlonging for a word of kindness had been so natural, and her shame and\r\nself-condemnation at the very thought that she was able to think of\r\nanything but her father, were so bitter, that the poor girl\'s forces,\r\nweakened by watching, were not able to withstand them. She sank into\r\nthe chair that stood nearest, and covered her face with her hands, and\r\ncried as people cry only at twenty. And as for Mr Wentworth, he had no\r\nright to take her in his arms and comfort her, nor to throw himself at\r\nher feet and entreat her to take courage. All he could do was to stand\r\nhalf a yard, yet a whole world, apart looking at her, his heart\r\nbeating with all the remorseful half-angry tenderness of love. Since\r\nit was not his to console her, he was almost impatient of her tears.\r\n\r\n"Dear, I have been telling Mr Wentworth about to-morrow," said Miss\r\nWodehouse, weeping too, as was natural, "and he thinks--he thinks--oh,\r\nmy darling! and so do I--that it will be too much for you. When I was\r\nyoung it never was the custom; and oh, Lucy, remember that ladies are\r\nnot to be expected to have such command over their feelings," said poor\r\nMiss Wodehouse, dropping on her knees by Lucy\'s chair. Mr Wentworth\r\nstood looking on in a kind of despair. He had nothing to say, and no\r\nright to say anything; even his presence was a kind of intrusion. But to\r\nbe referred to thus as an authority against Lucy\'s wishes, vexed him in\r\nthe most unreasonable way.\r\n\r\n"Mr Wentworth does not know me," said Lucy, under her breath, wiping\r\naway her tears with a trembling, indignant hand. "If we had had a\r\nbrother, it might have been different; but there must be somebody there\r\nthat loves him," said the poor girl, with a sob, getting up hastily from\r\nher chair. She could not bear to stay any longer in the room, which she\r\nhad entered with a vague sense of possible consolation. As for the\r\nCurate, he made haste to open the door for her, feeling the restraint of\r\nhis position almost intolerable. "_I_ shall be there," he said, stopping\r\nat the door to look into the fair, pallid face which Lucy would scarcely\r\nraise to listen. "Could you not trust _me_?" It looked like giving him a\r\npledge of something sacred and precious to put her hand into his, which\r\nwas held out for it so eagerly. But Lucy could not resist the softening\r\nof nature; and not even Miss Wodehouse, looking anxiously after them,\r\nheard what further words they were that Mr Wentworth said in her ear. "I\r\nam for your service, however and wherever you want me," said the Curate,\r\nwith a young man\'s absolutism. Heaven knows he had enough to do with his\r\nown troubles; but he remembered no obstacle which could prevent him from\r\ndedicating all his time and life to her as he spoke. When Lucy reached\r\nher own room, she threw herself upon the sofa, and wept like a woman\r\ninconsolable; but it was somehow because this consolation, subtle and\r\nsecret, had stolen into her heart that her tears flowed so freely. And\r\nMr Wentworth returned to her sister relieved, he could not have told\r\nwhy. At all events, come what might, the two had drawn together again in\r\ntheir mutual need.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr Wentworth, how can I cross her?" said Miss Wodehouse, wringing\r\nher hands. "If we had a brother--did you hear what she said? Here is\r\nhis letter, and I hope you will tell me candidly what you think. If we\r\ncould trust him--if we could but trust him! I daresay you think me\r\nvery changeable and foolish; but now we are alone," said the poor\r\nlady, "think what a comfort it would be if he only would change his\r\nways as he promised! Lucy is a great deal more use than I am, and\r\nunderstands things; but still we are only two women," said the elder\r\nsister. "If you think we could put any dependence upon him, Mr\r\nWentworth, I would never hesitate. He might live with us, and have his\r\nlittle allowance." Miss Wodehouse paused, and raised her anxious face\r\nto the Curate, pondering the particulars of the liberality she\r\nintended. "He is not a boy," she went on. "I daresay now he must feel\r\nthe want of the little comforts he once was used to; and though he is\r\nnot like what he used to be, neither in his looks nor his manners,\r\npeople would be kind to him for our sakes. Oh, Mr Wentworth, don\'t you\r\nthink we might trust him?" said the anxious woman, looking in the\r\nCurate\'s face.\r\n\r\nAll this time Mr Wentworth, with an impatience of her simplicity which\r\nit was difficult to restrain, was reading the letter, in which he\r\nperceived a very different intention from any divined by Miss Wodehouse.\r\nThe billet was disreputable enough, written in pencil, and without any\r\ndate.\r\n\r\n\r\n "MARY,--I mean to come to my father\'s funeral," wrote Mr Wodehouse\'s\r\n disowned son. "Things are changed now, as I said they would be. I and\r\n a friend of mine have set everything straight with Waters, and I mean\r\n to come in my own name, and take the place I have a right to. How it\r\n is to be after this depends on how you behave; but things are changed\r\n between you and me, as I told you they would be; and I expect you\r\n won\'t do anything to make \'em worse by doing or saying what\'s\r\n unpleasant. I add no more, because I hope you\'ll have sense to see\r\n what I mean, and to act accordingly.--Your brother,\r\n\r\n "THOMAS WODEHOUSE."\r\n\r\n\r\n"You see he thinks I will reproach him," said Miss Wodehouse,\r\nanxiously; perhaps it had just glanced across her own mind that\r\nsomething more important still might have dictated language so\r\ndecided. "He has a great deal more feeling than you would suppose,\r\npoor fellow! It is very touching in him to say, \'the place he has a\r\nright to\'--don\'t you think so, Mr Wentworth? Poor Tom! if we could but\r\ntrust him, and he would change his ways as he promised! Oh, Mr\r\nWentworth, don\'t you think I might speak of it to him to-morrow? If we\r\ncould--bury--everything--in dear papa\'s grave," cried the poor lady,\r\nonce more breaking down. Mr Wentworth took no notice of Miss\r\nWodehouse\'s tears. They moved him with sentiments entirely different\r\nfrom those with which he regarded Lucy\'s. He read the note over again\r\nwithout any attempt to console her, till she had struggled back into\r\ncomposure; but even then there was nothing sympathetic in the Curate\'s\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n"And I think you told me you did not know anything about the will?" he\r\nsaid, with some abruptness, making no account whatever of the\r\nsuggestion she had made.\r\n\r\n"No," said Miss Wodehouse; "but my dear father was a business man, Mr\r\nWentworth, and I feel quite sure--quite--"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said the Perpetual Curate; "nor of the nature of his property,\r\nperhaps?" added the worldly-minded young man whom poor Miss Wodehouse\r\nhad chosen for her adviser. It was more than the gentle woman could\r\nbear.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr Wentworth, you know I am not one to understand," cried the\r\npoor lady. "You ask me questions, but you never tell me what you think\r\nI should do. If it were only for myself, I would not mind, but I have\r\nto act for Lucy," said the elder sister, suddenly sitting upright and\r\ndrying her tears. "Papa, I am sure, did what was best for us," she\r\nsaid, with a little gentle dignity, which brought the Curate back to\r\nhis senses; "but oh, Mr Wentworth, look at the letter, and tell me,\r\nfor my sister\'s sake, what am I to do?"\r\n\r\nThe Curate went to the window, from which the sunshine was stealing\r\naway, to consider the subject; but he did not seem to derive much\r\nadditional wisdom from that sacred spot, where Lucy\'s work-table stood\r\nidle. "We must wait and see," he said to himself. When he came back to\r\nMiss Wodehouse, and saw the question still in her eyes, it only\r\nbrought back his impatience. "My dear Miss Wodehouse, instead of\r\nspeculating about what is to happen, it would be much better to\r\nprepare your sister for the discovery she must make to-morrow," said\r\nMr Wentworth; "I cannot give any other advice, for my part. I think it\r\nis a great pity that you have kept it concealed so long. I beg your\r\npardon for speaking so abruptly, but I am afraid you don\'t know all\r\nthe trouble that is before you. We are all in a great deal of\r\ntrouble," said the Perpetual Curate, with a little unconscious\r\nsolemnity. "I can\'t say I see my way through it; but you ought to\r\nprepare her--to see--her brother." He said the words with a degree of\r\nrepugnance which he could not conceal, and which wounded his\r\ncompanion\'s tender heart.\r\n\r\n"He was so different when he was young," said Miss Wodehouse, with a\r\nsuppressed sob--"he was a favourite everywhere. You would not have\r\nlooked so if you had known him then. Oh, Mr Wentworth, promise me that\r\nyou will not turn your back upon him if he comes home, after all your\r\nkindness. I will tell Lucy how much you have done for him," said Miss\r\nWodehouse. She was only half-conscious of her own gentle artifice. She\r\ntook the Curate\'s hand in both her own before he left her, and said it\r\nwas such a comfort to have his advice to rely upon; and she believed\r\nwhat she said, though Mr Wentworth himself knew better. The poor lady\r\nsat down in Lucy\'s chair, and had a cry at her ease after he went\r\naway. She was to tell Lucy--but how? and she sat pondering this hard\r\nquestion till all the light had faded out of the room, and the little\r\nwindow which was not shuttered dispersed only a grey twilight through\r\nthe empty place. The lamp, meantime, had been lighted in the little\r\nparlour where Lucy sat, very sad, in her black dress, with \'In\r\nMemoriam\' on the table by her, carrying on a similar strain in her\r\nheart. She was thinking of the past, so many broken scenes of which\r\nkept flashing up before her, all bright with indulgent love and\r\ntenderness--and she was thinking of the next day, when she was to see\r\nall that remained of her good father laid in his grave. He was not\r\nvery wise nor remarkable among men, but he had been the tenderest\r\nfather to the child of his old age; and in her heart she was praying\r\nfor him still, pausing now and then to think whether it was right. The\r\ntears were heavy in her young eyes, but they were natural tears, and\r\nLucy had no more thought that there was in the world anything sadder\r\nthan sorrow, or that any complications lay in her individual lot, than\r\nthe merest child in Prickett\'s Lane. She thought of going back to the\r\ndistrict, all robed and invested in the sanctity of her grief--she\r\nthought it was to last for ever, as one has the privilege of thinking\r\nwhen one is young; and it was to this young saint, tender towards all\r\nthe world, ready to pity everybody, and to save a whole race, if that\r\nhad been possible, that Miss Wodehouse went in, heavy and burdened,\r\nwith her tale of miserable vice, unkindness, estrangement. How was it\r\npossible to begin? Instead of beginning, poor Miss Wodehouse,\r\noverpowered by her anxieties and responsibilities, was taken ill and\r\nfainted, and had to be carried to bed. Lucy would not let her talk\r\nwhen she came to herself; and so the only moment of possible\r\npreparation passed away, and the event itself, which one of them knew\r\nnothing of, and the other did not understand, came in its own person,\r\nwithout any _avant-couriers_, to open Lucy\'s eyes once for all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Wentworth had to go into Carlingford on some business when he left\r\nMiss Wodehouse; and as he went home again, having his head full of so\r\nmany matters, he forgot for the moment what most immediately concerned\r\nhimself, and was close upon Elsworthy\'s shop, looking into the window,\r\nbefore he thought of it. Elsworthy himself was standing behind the\r\ncounter, with a paper in his hand, from which he was expounding\r\nsomething to various people in the shop. It was getting late, and the\r\ngas was lighted, which threw the interior into very bright relief to Mr\r\nWentworth outside. The Curate was still only a young man, though he was\r\na clergyman, and his movements were not always guided by reason or sound\r\nsense. He walked into the shop, almost before he was aware what he was\r\ndoing. The people were inconsiderable people enough--cronies of\r\nElsworthy--but they were people who had been accustomed to look up very\r\nreverentially to the Curate of St Roque\'s and Mr Wentworth was far from\r\nbeing superior to their disapproval. There was a very visible stir among\r\nthem as he entered, and Elsworthy came to an abrupt stop in his\r\nelucidations, and thrust the paper he had been reading into a drawer.\r\nDead and sudden silence followed the entrance of the Curate. Peter\r\nHayles, the druggist, who was one of the auditors, stole to the door\r\nwith intentions of escape, and the women, of whom there were two or\r\nthree, looked alarmed, not knowing what might come of it. As for Mr\r\nWentworth, there was only one thing possible for him to say. "Have you\r\nheard anything of Rosa, Elsworthy?" he asked, with great gravity, fixing\r\nhis eyes upon the man\'s face. The question seemed to ring into all the\r\ncorners. Whether it was innocence or utter abandonment nobody could\r\ntell, and the spectators held their breath for the answer. Elsworthy,\r\nfor his part, was as much taken by surprise as his neighbours. He grew\r\nvery pale and livid in his sudden excitement, and lost his voice, and\r\nstood staring at the Curate like a man struck dumb. Perhaps Mr Wentworth\r\ngot bolder when he saw the effect he had produced. He repeated the\r\nquestion, looking towards poor Mrs Elsworthy, who had jumped from her\r\nhusband\'s side when he came in. The whole party looked like startled\r\nconspirators to Mr Wentworth\'s eyes, though he had not the least idea\r\nwhat they had been doing. "Have you heard anything of Rosa?" he asked\r\nagain; and everybody looked at Elsworthy, as if he were the guilty man,\r\nand had suborned the rest; which, indeed, in one sense, was not far from\r\nbeing the case.\r\n\r\nWhen Elsworthy came to himself, he gave Mr Wentworth a sidelong\r\ndangerous look. "No, sir--nothing," said Rosa\'s uncle. "Them as has\r\nhidden her has hidden her well. I didn\'t expect to hear not yet," said\r\nElsworthy. Though Mr Wentworth did not know what he meant, his little\r\naudience in the shop did, and showed, by the slightest murmur in the\r\nworld, their conviction that the arrow had gone home, which naturally\r\nacted like a spur upon the Curate, who was not the wisest man in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n"I am very sorry to see you in so much distress," said the young man,\r\nlooking at Mrs Elsworthy\'s red eyes, "but I trust things will turn out\r\nmuch better than you imagine. If I can do anything to help you, let\r\nme know," said Mr Wentworth. Perhaps it was foolish to say so much,\r\nknowing what he did, but unfortunately prudence was not the ruling\r\nprinciple at that moment in the Curate\'s soul.\r\n\r\n"I was a-thinking of letting you know, sir," said the clerk of St\r\nRoque\'s, with deadly meaning; "leastways not me, but them as has taken\r\nme by the hand. There\'s every prospect as it\'ll all be known afore\r\nlong," said Elsworthy, pushing his wife aside and following Mr\r\nWentworth, with a ghastly caricature of his old obsequiousness, to the\r\ndoor. "There\'s inquiries a-being made as was never known to fail. For\r\none thing, I\'ve written to them as knows a deal about the movements of\r\na party as is suspected--not to say as I\'ve got good friends," said\r\nRosa\'s guardian, standing upon the step of his own door, and watching\r\nthe Curate out into the darkness. Mr Wentworth could not altogether\r\nrestrain a slight thrill of unpleasant emotion, for Elsworthy,\r\nstanding at his door with the light gleaming over him from behind, and\r\nhis face invisible, had an unpleasant resemblance to a wild beast\r\nwaiting for his prey.\r\n\r\n"I am glad to think you are likely to be so successful. Send me word\r\nas soon as you know," said the Curate, and he pursued his way home\r\nafterwards, with feelings far from pleasant. He saw something was\r\nabout to come of this more than he had thought likely, and the crisis\r\nwas approaching. As he walked rapidly home, he concluded within\r\nhimself to have a conversation with the Rector next day after Mr\r\nWodehouse\'s funeral, and to ask for an investigation into the whole\r\nmatter. When he had come to this conclusion, he dismissed the subject\r\nfrom his mind as far as was possible, and took to thinking of the\r\nother matters which disturbed his repose, in which, indeed, it was\r\nvery easy to get perplexed and bewildered to his heart\'s content.\r\nAnyhow, one way and another, the day of poor Mr Wodehouse\'s funeral\r\nmust necessarily be an exciting and momentous day.\r\n\r\nMr Wentworth had, however, no idea that its interest was to begin so\r\nearly. When he was seated at breakfast reading his letters, a note was\r\nbrought to him, which, coming in the midst of a lively chronicle of\r\nhome news from his sister Letty, almost stopped for the moment the\r\nbeating of the Curate\'s heart. It took him so utterly by surprise,\r\nthat more violent sentiments were lost for the moment in mere wonder.\r\nHe read it over twice before he could make it out. It was from the\r\nRector, and notwithstanding his wife\'s remonstrances, and his own\r\nqualms of doubt and uncertainty, this was what Mr Morgan said:--\r\n\r\n\r\n "DEAR SIR,--It is my painful duty to let you know that certain rumours\r\n have reached my ears very prejudicial to your character as a\r\n clergyman, and which I understand to be very generally current in\r\n Carlingford. Such a scandal, if not properly dealt with, is certain to\r\n have an unfavourable effect upon the popular mind, and injure the\r\n clergy in the general estimation--while it is, as I need not point\r\n out  to you, quite destructive of your own usefulness. Under the\r\n circumstances, I have thought it my duty, as Rector of the parish,\r\n to take steps for investigating these reports. Of course I do not\r\n pretend to any authority over you, nor can I enforce in any way your\r\n participation in the inquiry or consent to it; but I beg to urge upon\r\n you strongly, as a friend, the advantage of assenting freely, that\r\n your innocence (if possible) may be made apparent, and your character\r\n cleared. I enclose the names of the gentlemen whose assistance I\r\n intend to request for this painful duty, in case you should object to\r\n any of them; and would again urge you, _for your own sake_, the\r\n expediency of concurrence. I regret to say that, though I would not\r\n willingly prejudge any man, much less a brother clergyman, I do not\r\n feel that it would be seemly on my part, under the circumstances, to\r\n avail myself of your assistance today in the burial-service for the\r\n late Mr Wodehouse.--Believe me, very sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n "W. MORGAN."\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Mr Wentworth looked up from this letter, he caught sight of his\r\nface in the mirror opposite, and gazed into his own eyes like a man\r\nstupefied. He had not been without vexations in eight-and-twenty years\r\nof a not uneventful life, but he had never known anything like the\r\nmisery of that moment. It was nearly four hours later when he walked\r\nslowly up Grange Lane to the house, which before night might own so\r\ndifferent a master, but he had found as yet no time to spare for the\r\nWodehouses--even for Lucy--in the thoughts which were all occupied by\r\nthe unlooked-for blow. Nobody could tell, not even himself, the mental\r\ndiscipline he had gone through before he emerged, rather stern, but\r\nperfectly calm, in the sunshine in front of the closed-up house. If it\r\nwas not his to meet the solemn passenger at the gates with words of\r\nhope, at least he could do a man\'s part to the helpless who had still\r\nto live; but the blow was cruel, and all the force of his nature was\r\nnecessary to sustain it. All Carlingford knew, by the evidence of its\r\nsenses, that Mr Wentworth had been a daily visitor of the dead, and\r\none of his most intimate friends, and nobody had doubted for a moment\r\nthat to him would be assigned as great a portion of the service as his\r\nfeelings permitted him to undertake. When the bystanders saw him join\r\nthe procession, a thrill of surprise ran through the crowd; but\r\nnobody--not even the man who walked beside him--ventured to trifle\r\nwith the Curate\'s face so far as to ask why. The Grand Inquisitor\r\nhimself, if such a mythical personage exists any longer, could not\r\nhave invented a more delicate torture than that which the respectable\r\nand kind-hearted Rector of Carlingford inflicted calmly, without\r\nknowing it, upon the Curate of St Roque\'s. How was Mr Morgan to know\r\nthat the sting would go to his heart? A Perpetual Curate without a\r\ndistrict has nothing to do with a heart so sensitive. The Rector put\r\non his own robes with a peaceful mind, feeling that he had done his\r\nduty, and, with Mr Leeson behind him, came to the church door with\r\ngreat solemnity to meet the procession. He read the words which are\r\nso sweet and so terrible with his usual reading-desk voice as he read\r\nthe invitations every Sunday. He was a good man, but he was middle-aged,\r\nand not accessible to impression from the mere aspect of death; and he\r\ndid not know Mr Wodehouse, nor care much for anything in the matter,\r\nexcept his own virtue in excluding the Perpetual Curate from any share\r\nin the service. Such was the Rector\'s feeling in respect to this\r\nfuneral, which made so much commotion in Carlingford. He felt that he\r\nwas vindicating the purity of his profession as he threaded his way\r\nthrough the pathetic hillocks, where the nameless people were lying, to\r\npoor Mr Wodehouse\'s grave.\r\n\r\nThis, however, was not the only thing which aroused the wonder and\r\ninterest of the townspeople when the two shrinking, hooded female\r\nfigures, all black and unrecognisable, rose up trembling to follow their\r\ndead from the church to the grave. Everybody saw with wonder that their\r\nplace was contested, and that somebody else, a man whom no one knew,\r\nthrust himself before them, and walked alone in the chief mourner\'s\r\nplace. As for Lucy, who, through her veil and her tears, saw nothing\r\ndistinctly, this figure, which she did not know, struck her only with a\r\nvague astonishment. If she thought of it at all, she thought it a\r\nmistake, simple enough, though a little startling, and went on, doing\r\nall she could to support her sister, saying broken prayers in her heart,\r\nand far too much absorbed in the duty she was performing to think who\r\nwas looking on, or to be conscious of any of the attending\r\ncircumstances, except Mr Morgan\'s voice, which was not the voice she had\r\nexpected to hear. Miss Wodehouse was a great deal more agitated than\r\nLucy. She knew very well who it was that placed himself before her,\r\nasserting his own right without offering any help to his sisters; and\r\nvague apprehensions, which she herself could not understand, came over\r\nher just at the moment when she required her strength most. As there\r\nwere no other relations present, the place of honour next to the two\r\nladies had been tacitly conceded to Mr Proctor and Mr Wentworth; and it\r\nwas thus that the Curate rendered the last service to his old friend. It\r\nwas a strange procession, and concentrated in itself all that was most\r\nexciting in Carlingford at the moment. Everybody observed and commented\r\nupon the strange man, who, all remarkable and unknown, with his great\r\nbeard and sullen countenance, walked by himself as chief mourner. Who\r\nwas he? and whispers arose and ran through the outskirts of the crowd of\r\nthe most incredible description. Some said he was an illegitimate son\r\nwhom Mr Wodehouse had left all his property to, but whom the ladies knew\r\nnothing of; some that it was a strange cousin, whom Lucy was to be\r\ncompelled to marry or lose her share; and after a while people compared\r\nnotes, and went back upon their recollections, and began to ask each\r\nother if it was true that Tom Wodehouse died twenty years ago in the\r\nWest Indies? Then behind the two ladies--poor ladies, whose fate was\r\nhanging in the balance, though they did not know it--came Mr Wentworth\r\nin his cap and gown, pale and stern as nobody ever had seen him before\r\nin Carlingford, excluded from all share in the service, which Mr Leeson,\r\nin a flutter of surplice and solemnity, was giving his valuable\r\nassistance in. The churchyard at Carlingford had not lost its semi-rural\r\nair though the town had increased so much, for the district was very\r\nhealthy, as everybody knows, and people did not die before their time,\r\nas in places less favoured. The townspeople, who knew Mr Wodehouse so\r\nwell, lingered all about among the graves, looking with neighbourly,\r\ncalm regret, but the liveliest curiosity. Most of the shopkeepers at\r\nthat end of George Street had closed their shops on the mournful\r\noccasion, and felt themselves repaid. As for Elsworthy, he stood with a\r\ngroup of supporters round him, as near as possible to the funeral\r\nprocession; and farther off in the distance, under the trees, was a much\r\nmore elegant spectator--an unlikely man enough to assist at such a\r\nspectacle, being no less a person than Jack Wentworth, in the\r\nperfection of an English gentleman\'s morning apparel, perfectly at his\r\nease and indifferent, yet listening with close attention to all the\r\nscraps of talk that came in his way. The centre of all this wondering,\r\ncurious crowd, where so many passions and emotions and schemes and\r\npurposes were in full tide, and life was beating so strong and vehement,\r\nwas the harmless dead, under the heavy pall which did not veil him so\r\nentirely from the living as did the hopes and fears and curious\r\nspeculations which had already sprung up over him, filling up his place.\r\nAmong the whole assembly there was not one heart really occupied by\r\nthoughts of him, except that of poor Lucy, who knew nothing of all the\r\nabsorbing anxieties and terrors that occupied the others. She had still\r\na moment\'s leisure for her natural grief. It was all she could do to\r\nkeep upright and support her sister, who had burdens to bear which Lucy\r\nknew nothing of; but still, concealed under her hood and veil, seeing\r\nnothing but the grave before her, hearing nothing but the sacred words\r\nand the terrible sound of "dust to dust," the young creature stood\r\nsteadfast, and gave the dead man who had loved her his due--last\r\noffering of nature and love, sweeter to anticipate than any honours.\r\nNobody but his child offered to poor Mr Wodehouse that last right of\r\nhumanity, or made his grave sacred with natural tears.\r\n\r\nWhen they went back sadly out of all that blinding sunshine into the\r\ndarkened house, it was not all over, as poor Lucy had supposed. She\r\nhad begun to come to herself and understand once more the looks of the\r\npeople about her, when the old maid, who had been the attendant of the\r\nsisters during all Lucy\'s life, undid her wrappings, and in her\r\nagitation of the moment kissed her white cheek, and held her in her\r\narms. "Oh, Miss Lucy, darling, don\'t take on no more than you can\r\nhelp. I\'m sore, sore afeared that there\'s a deal of trouble afore you\r\nyet," said the weeping woman. Though Lucy had not the smallest\r\npossible clue to her meaning, and was almost too much worn out to be\r\ncurious, she could not help a vague thrill of alarm. "What is it,\r\nAlland?" she said, rising up from the sofa on which she had thrown\r\nherself. But Alland could do nothing but cry over her nursling and\r\nconsole her. "Oh, my poor dear! oh, my darling! as he never would have\r\nlet the wind of heaven to blow rough upon her!" cried the old servant.\r\nAnd it was just then that Miss Wodehouse, who was trembling all over\r\nhysterically, came into the room.\r\n\r\n"We have to go down-stairs," said the elder sister. "Oh Lucy, my\r\ndarling, it was not my fault at first. I should have told you last\r\nnight to prepare you, and I had not the heart. Mr Wentworth has told\r\nme so often--"\r\n\r\n"Mr Wentworth?" said Lucy. She rose up, not quite knowing where she\r\nwas; aware of nothing, except that some sudden calamity, under which\r\nshe was expected to faint altogether, was coming to her by means of Mr\r\nWentworth. Her mind jumped at the only dim possibility that seemed to\r\nglimmer through the darkness. He must be married, she supposed, or\r\nabout to be married; and it was this they insulted her by thinking\r\nthat she could not bear. There was not a particle of colour in her\r\nface before, but the blood rushed into it with a bitterness of shame\r\nand rage which she had never known till now. "I will go down with you\r\nif it is necessary," said Lucy; "but surely this is a strange time to\r\ntalk of Mr Wentworth\'s affairs." There was no time to explain anything\r\nfarther, for just then old Mrs Western, who was a distant cousin,\r\nknocked at the door. "God help you, my poor dear children!" said the\r\nold lady; "they are all waiting for you down-stairs," and it was with\r\nthis delusion in her mind, embittering every thought, that Lucy went\r\ninto the drawing-room where they were all assembled. The madness of\r\nthe idea did not strike her somehow, even when she saw the grave\r\nassembly, which it was strange to think could have been brought\r\ntogether to listen to any explanation from the Perpetual Curate. He\r\nwas standing there prominent enough among them, with a certain air of\r\nsuppressed passion in his face, which Lucy divined almost without\r\nseeing it. For her own part, she went in with perfect firmness,\r\nsupporting her sister, whose trembling was painful to see. There was\r\nno other lady in the room except old Mrs Western, who would not sit\r\ndown, but hovered behind the chairs which had been placed for the\r\nsisters near the table at which Mr Waters was standing. By the side of\r\nMr Waters was the man who had been at the funeral, and whom nobody\r\nknew, and a few gentlemen who were friends of the family were in the\r\nroom--the Rector, by virtue of his office, and Mr Proctor and Dr\r\nMarjoribanks; and any one whose attention was sufficiently disengaged\r\nto note the details of the scene might have perceived John, who had\r\nbeen fifteen years with Mr Wodehouse, and the old cook in her black\r\ngown, who was of older standing in the family than Alland herself,\r\npeeping in, whenever it was opened, through the door.\r\n\r\n"Now that the Miss Wodehouses are here, we may proceed to business,"\r\nsaid Mr Waters. "Some of the party are already aware that I have an\r\nimportant communication to make. I am very sorry if it comes abruptly\r\nupon anybody specially interested. My late partner, much respected\r\nthough he has always been, was a man of peculiar views in many\r\nrespects. Dr Marjoribanks will bear me out in what I say. I had been\r\nhis partner for ten years before I found this out, highly important as\r\nit will be seen to be; and I believe Mr Wentworth, though an intimate\r\nfriend of the family, obtained the information by a kind of\r\naccident--"\r\n\r\nThe stranger muttered something in his beard which nobody could hear,\r\nand the Perpetual Curate interposed audibly. "Would it not be best to\r\nmake the explanations afterwards?" said Mr Wentworth--and he changed\r\nhis own position and went over beside old Mrs Western, who was leaning\r\nupon Lucy\'s chair. He put his own hand on the back of the chair with\r\nan involuntary impulse. As for Lucy, her first thrill of nervous\r\nstrength had failed her: she began to get confused and bewildered; but\r\nwhatever it was, no insult, no wound to her pride or affections, was\r\ncoming to her from that hand which she knew was on her chair. She\r\nleaned back a little, with a long sigh. Her imagination could not\r\nconceive anything important enough for such a solemn intimation, and\r\nher attention began to flag in spite of herself. No doubt it was\r\nsomething about that money which people thought so interesting.\r\nMeanwhile Mr Waters went on steadily with what he had to say, not\r\nsparing them a word of the preamble; and it was not till ten minutes\r\nlater that Lucy started up with a sudden cry of incredulity and\r\nwonder, and repeated his last words. "His son!--whose son?" cried\r\nLucy. She looked all round her, not knowing whom to appeal to in her\r\nsudden consternation. "We never had a brother," said the child of Mr\r\nWodehouse\'s old age; "it must be some mistake." There was a dead pause\r\nafter these words. When she looked round again, a sickening conviction\r\ncame to Lucy\'s heart that it was no mistake. She rose up without\r\nknowing it, and looked round upon all the people, who were watching\r\nher with various looks of pity and curiosity and spectator-interest.\r\nMr Waters had stopped speaking, and the terrible stranger made a step\r\nforward with an air that identified him. It was at him that Mr Proctor\r\nwas staring, who cleared his voice a great many times, and came\r\nforward to the middle of the room and looked as if he meant to speak;\r\nand upon him every eye was fixed except Mr Wentworth\'s, who was\r\nwatching Lucy, and Miss Wodehouse\'s, which were hidden in her hands.\r\n"We never had a brother," she repeated, faltering; and then, in the\r\nextremity of her wonder and excitement, Lucy turned round, without\r\nknowing it, to the man whom her heart instinctively appealed to. "Is\r\nit true?" she said. She held out her hands to him with a kind of\r\nentreaty not to say so. Mr Wentworth made no reply to her question. He\r\nsaid only, "Let me take you away--it is too much for you," bending\r\ndown over her, without thinking what he did, and drawing her hand\r\nthrough his arm. "She is not able for any more," said the Curate,\r\nhurriedly; "afterwards we can explain to her." If he could have\r\nremembered anything about himself at the moment, it is probable that\r\nhe would have denied himself the comfort of supporting Lucy--he, a man\r\nunder ban; but he was thinking only of her, as he stood facing them\r\nall with her arm drawn through his; upon which conjunction the Rector\r\nand the late Rector looked with a grim aspect, disposed to interfere,\r\nbut not knowing how.\r\n\r\n"All this may be very interesting to you," said the stranger out of\r\nhis beard; "if Lucy don\'t know her brother, it is no fault of mine. Mr\r\nWaters has only said half he has got to say; and as for the rest, to\r\nsum it up in half-a-dozen words, I\'m very glad to see you in my house,\r\ngentlemen, and I hope you will make yourselves at home. Where nobody\r\nunderstands, a man has to speak plain. I\'ve been turned out all my\r\nlife and, by Jove! I don\'t mean to stand it any longer. The girls can\r\nhave what their father\'s left them," said the vagabond, in his moment\r\nof triumph. "They aint my business no more than I was theirs. The\r\nproperty is freehold, and Waters is aware that I\'m the heir."\r\n\r\nSaying this, Wodehouse drew a chair to the table, and sat down with\r\nemphasis. He was the only man seated in the room, and he kept his\r\nplace in his sullen way amid the excited group which gathered round\r\nhim. As for Miss Wodehouse, some sense of what had happened penetrated\r\neven her mind. She too rose up and wiped her tears from her face, and\r\nlooked round, pale and scared, to the Curate. "I was thinking--of\r\nspeaking to Lucy. I meant to ask her--to take you back, Tom," said the\r\nelder sister. "Oh, Mr Wentworth, tell me, for heaven\'s sake, what does\r\nit mean?"\r\n\r\n"If I had only been permitted to explain," said Mr Waters; "my worthy\r\npartner died intestate--his son is his natural heir. Perhaps we need not\r\ndetain the ladies longer, now that they understand it. All the rest can\r\nbe better arranged with their representative. I am very sorry to add to\r\ntheir sufferings today," said the polite lawyer, opening the door;\r\n"everything else can be made the subject of an arrangement." He held the\r\ndoor open with a kind of civil coercion compelling their departure. The\r\nfamiliar room they were in no longer belonged to the Miss Wodehouses.\r\nLucy drew her arm out of Mr Wentworth\'s, and took her sister\'s hand.\r\n\r\n"You will be our representative," she said to him, out of the fulness\r\nof her heart. When the door closed, the Perpetual Curate took up his\r\nposition, facing them all with looks more lofty than belonged even to\r\nhis Wentworth blood. They had kept him from exercising his office at\r\nhis friend\'s grave, but nobody could take from him the still nobler\r\nduty of defending the oppressed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the door closed upon Lucy and her sister, Mr Wentworth stood by\r\nhimself, facing the other people assembled. The majority of them were\r\nmore surprised, more shocked, than he was; but they were huddled\r\ntogether in their wonder at the opposite end of the table, and had\r\nsomehow a confused, half-conscious air of being on the other side.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a very extraordinary revelation that has just been made to us,"\r\nsaid Dr Marjoribanks. "I am throwing no doubt upon it, for my part; but\r\nmy conviction was, that Tom Wodehouse died in the West Indies. He was\r\njust the kind of man to die in the West Indies. If it\'s you," said the\r\nDoctor, with a growl of natural indignation, "you have the constitution\r\nof an elephant. You should have been dead ten years ago, at the very\r\nleast; and it appears to me there would be some difficulty in proving\r\nidentity, if anybody would take up that view of the question." As he\r\nspoke, Dr Marjoribanks walked round the new-comer, looking at him with\r\nmedical criticism. The Doctor\'s eyes shot out fiery hazel gleams as he\r\ncontemplated the heavy figure. "More appearance than reality," he\r\nmuttered to himself, with a kind of grim satisfaction, poising a\r\nforefinger in air, as if to prove the unwholesome flesh; and then he\r\nwent round to the other elbow of the unexpected heir. "The thing is now,\r\nwhat you mean to do for them, to repair your father\'s neglect," he said,\r\ntapping peremptorily on Wodehouse\'s arm.\r\n\r\n"There is something else to be said in the mean time," said Mr\r\nWentworth. "I must know precisely how it is that a state of affairs so\r\ndifferent from anything Mr Wodehouse could have intended has come about.\r\nThe mere absence of a will does not seem to me to explain it. I should\r\nlike to have Mr Brown\'s advice--for my own satisfaction, if nothing\r\nelse."\r\n\r\n"The parson has got nothing to do with it, that I can see," said\r\nWodehouse, "unless he was looking for a legacy, or that sort of thing.\r\nAs for the girls, I don\'t see what right I have to be troubled; they\r\ntook deuced little trouble with me. Perhaps they\'d have taken me in as\r\na sort of footman without pay--you heard what they said, Waters? By\r\nJove! I\'ll serve Miss Mary out for that," said the vagabond. Then he\r\npaused a little, and, looking round him, moderated his tone. "I\'ve\r\nbeen badly used all my life," said the prodigal son. "They would never\r\ngive me a hearing. They say I did heaps of things I never dreamt of.\r\nMary aint above thinking of her own interest--"\r\n\r\nHere Mr Proctor came forward from the middle of the room where he had\r\nbeen standing in a perplexed manner since the ladies went away.\r\n"Hold--hold your tongue, sir!" said the late Rector; "haven\'t you done\r\nenough injury already--" When he had said so much, he stopped as\r\nabruptly as he had begun, and seemed to recollect all at once that he\r\nhad no title to interfere.\r\n\r\n"By Jove!" said Wodehouse, "you don\'t seem to think I know what\r\nbelongs to me, or who belongs to me. Hold _your_ tongue, Waters; I can\r\nspeak for myself. I\'ve been long enough snubbed by everybody that had\r\na mind. I don\'t mean to put up with this sort of thing any longer. Any\r\nman who pleases can consult John Brown. I recollect John Brown as well\r\nas anybody in Carlingford. It don\'t matter to me what he says, or what\r\nanybody says. The girls are a parcel of girls, and I am my father\'s\r\nson, as it happens. I should have thought the parson had enough on his\r\nhands for one while," said the new heir, in the insolence of triumph.\r\n"He tried patronising me, but that wouldn\'t answer. Why, there\'s his\r\nbrother, Jack Wentworth, his elder brother, come down here purposely\r\nto manage matters for me. He\'s the eldest son, by Jove! and one of the\r\ngreatest swells going. He has come down here on purpose to do the\r\nfriendly thing by me. We\'re great friends, by Jove! Jack Wentworth and\r\nI; and yet here\'s a beggarly younger brother, that hasn\'t a penny--"\r\n\r\n"Wodehouse," said Mr Wentworth, with some contempt, "sit down and be\r\nquiet. You and I have some things to talk of which had better not be\r\ndiscussed in public. Leave Jack Wentworth\'s name alone, if you are\r\nwise, and don\'t imagine that I am going to bear your punishment. Be\r\nsilent, sir!" cried the Curate, sternly; "do you suppose I ask any\r\nexplanations from you? Mr Waters, I want to hear how this has come\r\nabout? When I saw you in this man\'s interest some time ago, you were\r\nnot so friendly to him. Tell me how it happens that he is now your\r\nclient, and that you set him forth as the heir!"\r\n\r\n"By Jove, the parson has nothing to do with it! Let him find it out,"\r\nmuttered Wodehouse in his beard; but the words were only half audible,\r\nand the vagabond\'s shabby soul was cowed in spite of himself. He gave\r\nthe lawyer a furtive thrust in the arm as he spoke, and looked at him\r\na little anxiously; for the position of a man standing lawfully on his\r\nnatural rights was new to Wodehouse; and all his certainty of the\r\nfacts did not save him from a sensation of habit which suggested that\r\nclose examination was alarming, and that something might still be\r\nfound out. As for Mr Waters, he looked with placid contempt at the\r\nman, who was not respectable, and still had the instincts of a\r\nvagabond in his heart.\r\n\r\n"I am perfectly ready to explain," said the irreproachable solicitor,\r\nwho was quite secure in his position. "The tone of the request,\r\nhowever, might be modified a little; and as I don\'t, any more than Mr\r\nWodehouse, see exactly what right Mr Wentworth has to demand--"\r\n\r\n"I ask an explanation, not on my own behalf, but for the Miss\r\nWodehouses, who have made me their deputy," said the Curate, "for\r\ntheir satisfaction, and that I may consult Mr Brown. You seem to\r\nforget that all _he_ gains they lose; which surely justifies their\r\nrepresentative in asking how did it come about?"\r\n\r\nIt was at this point that all the other gentlemen present pressed\r\ncloser, and evinced an intention to take part. Dr Marjoribanks was the\r\nfirst to speak. He took a pinch of snuff, and while he consumed it\r\nlooked from under his grizzled sandy eyebrows with a perplexing\r\nmixture of doubt and respect at the Perpetual Curate. He was a man of\r\nsome discrimination in his way, and the young man\'s lofty looks\r\nimpressed him a little in spite of himself.\r\n\r\n"Not to interrupt the explanation," said Dr Marjoribanks, "which we\'ll\r\nall be glad to hear--but Mr Wentworth\'s a young man, not possessed, so\r\nfar as I am aware, of any particular right;--except that he has been\r\nvery generous and prompt in offering his services," said the Doctor,\r\nmoved to the admission by a fiery glance from the Curate\'s eye, which\r\nsomehow did not look like the eye of a guilty man. "I was thinking, an\r\nold man, and an old friend, like myself, might maybe be a better\r\nguardian for the ladies\' interests--"\r\n\r\nMr Proctor, who had been listening very anxiously, was seized with a\r\ncough at this moment, which drowned out the Doctor\'s words. It was a\r\npreparatory cough, and out of it the late Rector rushed into speech.\r\n"I have come from--from Oxford to be of use," said the new champion.\r\n"My time is entirely at my own--at Miss Wodehouse\'s--at the Miss\r\nWodehouses\' disposal. I am most desirous to be of use," said Mr\r\nProctor, anxiously. And he advanced close to the table to prefer his\r\nclaim.\r\n\r\n"Such a discussion seems quite unnecessary," said Mr Wentworth, with\r\nsome haughtiness. "I shall certainly do in the mean time what has been\r\nintrusted to me. At present we are simply losing time."\r\n\r\n"But--" said the Rector. The word was not of importance nor uttered\r\nwith much resolution, but it arrested Mr Wentworth more surely than\r\nthe shout of a multitude. He turned sharp round upon his adversary,\r\nand said "Well?" with an air of exasperation; while Wodehouse, who had\r\nbeen lounging about the room in a discomfited condition, drew near to\r\nlisten.\r\n\r\n"I am comparatively a stranger to the Miss Wodehouses," said Mr\r\nMorgan; "still I am their clergyman; and I think with Dr Marjoribanks,\r\nthat a young man like Mr Wentworth, especially a man so seriously\r\ncompromised--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, stop! I do think you are all a great deal too hard upon Mr\r\nWentworth," said the lawyer, with a laugh of toleration, which\r\nWodehouse echoed behind him with a sense of temerity that made his\r\nlaughter all the louder. He was frightened, but he was glad to make\r\nhimself offensive, according to his nature. Mr Wentworth stood alone,\r\nfor his part, and had to put up with the laugh as he best could.\r\n\r\n"If any one here wishes to injure me with the Miss Wodehouses, an\r\nopportunity may easily be found," said the Curate, with as much\r\ncomposure as he could muster; "and I am ready to relinquish my charge\r\nwhen they call on me to do so. In the mean time, this is not the place\r\nto investigate my conduct. Sit down, sir, and let us be free of your\r\ninterference for this moment at least," he said, fiercely, turning to\r\nthe new heir. "I warn you again, you have nothing but justice to expect\r\nat my hands. Mr Waters, we wait your explanations." He was the tallest\r\nman in the room, which perhaps had something to do with it; the\r\nyoungest, best born, and best endowed. That he would have carried the\r\nday triumphantly in the opinion of any popular audience, there could be\r\nno kind of doubt. Even in this middle-aged unimpressionable assembly,\r\nhis indignant self-control had a certain influence. When he drew a chair\r\ntowards the table and seated himself, the others sat down unawares, and\r\nthe lawyer began his story without any further interruption. The\r\nexplanation of all was, that Mr Wodehouse, like so many men, had an\r\nambition to end his days as a country gentleman. He had set his heart\r\nfor years on an estate in the neighbourhood of Carlingford, and had just\r\ncompleted his long-contemplated purchase at the moment of his last\r\nseizure. Nobody knew, except the Curate and the lawyer, what the cause\r\nof that seizure was. They exchanged looks without being aware of it, and\r\nWodehouse, still more deeply conscious, uttered, poor wretch! a kind of\r\ngasp, which sounded like a laugh to the other horrified spectators.\r\nAfter all, it was his crime which had brought him his good fortune,\r\nfor there had been an early will relating to property which existed\r\nno longer--property which had been altogether absorbed in the\r\nnewly-acquired estate. "I have no doubt my late excellent partner would\r\nhave made a settlement had the time been permitted him," said Mr Waters.\r\n"I have not the slightest doubt as to his intentions; but the end was\r\nvery unexpected at the last. I suppose death always is unexpected when\r\nit comes," said the lawyer, with a little solemnity, recollecting that\r\nthree of his auditors were clergymen. "The result is painful in many\r\nrespects; but law is law, and such accidents cannot be entirely avoided.\r\nWith the exception of a few trifling personal matters, and the\r\nfurniture, and a little money at the bank, there is nothing but freehold\r\nproperty, and of course the son takes that. I can have no possible\r\nobjection to your consulting Mr Brown; but Mr Brown can give you no\r\nfurther information." If there had been any little hope of possible\r\nredress lingering in the mind of the perplexed assembly, this brought it\r\nto a conclusion. The heir, who had been keeping behind with an impulse\r\nof natural shame, came back to the table when his rights were so clearly\r\nestablished. He did not know how to behave himself with a good grace,\r\nbut he was disposed to be conciliatory, as far as he could, especially\r\nas it began to be disagreeably apparent that the possession of his\r\nfather\'s property might not make any particular difference in the\r\nworld\'s opinion of himself.\r\n\r\n"It aint my fault, gentlemen," said Wodehouse. "Of course, I expected\r\nthe governor to take care of the girls. I\'ve been kept out of it for\r\ntwenty years, and that\'s a long time. By Jove! I\'ve never known what\r\nit was to be a rich man\'s son since I was a lad. I don\'t say I won\'t\r\ndo something for the girls if they behave to me as they ought; and as\r\nfor you, gentlemen, who were friends of the family, I\'ll always be\r\nglad to see you in my house," he said, with an attempt at a friendly\r\nsmile. But nobody took any notice of the overtures of the new heir.\r\n\r\n"Then they have nothing to depend upon," said Mr Proctor, whose agitated\r\nlooks were the most inexplicable feature of the whole--"no shelter even;\r\nno near relations I ever heard of--and nobody to take care of Lucy if--"\r\nHere he stopped short and went to the window, and stood looking out in a\r\nstate of great bewilderment. The late Rector was so buried in his own\r\nthoughts, whatever they might be, that he did not pay any attention to\r\nthe further conversation which went on behind him--of which, however,\r\nthere was very little--and only came to himself when he saw Mr Wentworth\r\ngo rapidly through the garden. Mr Proctor rushed after the Perpetual\r\nCurate. He might be seriously compromised, as Mr Morgan said; but he\r\nwas more sympathetic than anybody else in Carlingford under present\r\ncircumstances; and Mr Proctor, in his middle-aged uncertainty, could not\r\nhelp having a certain confidence in the young man\'s promptitude and\r\nvigour. He made up to him out of breath when he was just entering George\r\nStreet. Carlingford had paid what respect it could to Mr Wodehouse\'s\r\nmemory; and now the shutters were being taken off the shop-windows, and\r\npeople in general were very willing to reward themselves for their\r\nself-denial by taking what amusement they could out of the reports\r\nwhich already began to be circulated about the way in which the Miss\r\nWodehouses were "left." When the late Rector came up with the Perpetual\r\nCurate opposite Masters\'s shop there was quite a group of people there\r\nwho noted the conjunction. What could it mean? Was there going to be a\r\ncompromise? Was Carlingford to be shamefully cheated out of the\r\n"investigation," and all the details about Rosa Elsworthy, for which it\r\nhungered? Mr Proctor put his arm through that of the Curate of St\r\nRoque\'s, and permitted himself to be swept along by the greater impetus\r\nof the young man\'s rapid steps, for at this moment, being occupied with\r\nmore important matters, the late Rector had altogether forgotten Mr\r\nWentworth\'s peculiar position, and the cloud that hung over him.\r\n\r\n"What a very extraordinary thing!" said Mr Proctor. "What could have\r\nbetrayed old Wodehouse into such a blunder! He must have known well\r\nenough. This son--this fellow--has been living all the time, of\r\ncourse. It is quite inexplicable to me," said the aggrieved man. "Do\r\nyou know if there are any aunts or uncles--any people whom poor little\r\nLucy might live with, for instance, if--" And here Mr Proctor once\r\nmore came to a dead stop. Mr Wentworth, for his part, was so far from\r\nthinking of her as "poor little Lucy," that he was much offended by\r\nthe unnecessary commiseration.\r\n\r\n"The sisters will naturally remain together," he said; "and, of\r\ncourse, there are many people who would be but too glad to receive\r\nthem. Miss Wodehouse is old enough to protect her sister--though, of\r\ncourse, the balance of character is on the other side," said the\r\ninconsiderate young man; at which Mr Proctor winced, but made no\r\ndefinite reply.\r\n\r\n"So you think there are people she could go to?" said the late Rector,\r\nafter a pause. "The thing altogether is so unexpected, you know. My\r\nidea was--"\r\n\r\n"I beg your pardon," said the Curate; "I must see Mr Brown, and this\r\nis about the best time to find him at home. Circumstances make it\r\nrather awkward for me to call at the Rectory just now," he continued,\r\nwith a smile smile--"circumstances over which I have no control, as\r\npeople say; but perhaps you will stay long enough to see me put on my\r\ntrial. Good-bye now."\r\n\r\n"Stop a moment," said Mr Proctor; "about this trial. Don\'t be\r\naffronted--I have nothing to do with it, you know; and Morgan means\r\nvery well, though he\'s stupid enough. I should like to stand your\r\nfriend, Wentworth; you know I would. I wish you\'d yield to tell me all\r\nabout it. If I were to call on you to-night after dinner--for perhaps\r\nit would put Mrs Hadwin out to give me a chop?"\r\n\r\nThe Curate laughed in spite of himself. "Fellows of All-Souls don\'t\r\ndine on chops," he said, unable to repress a gleam of amusement; "but\r\ncome at six, and you shall have something to eat, as good as I can\r\ngive you. As for telling you all about it," said Mr Wentworth, "all\r\nthe world is welcome to know as much as I know."\r\n\r\nMr Proctor laid his hand on the young man\'s arm, by way of soothing\r\nhim. "We\'ll talk it all over," he said, confidentially; "both this\r\naffair, and--and the other. We have a good deal in common, if I am not\r\nmuch mistaken, and I trust we shall always be good friends," said the\r\ninexplicable man. His complexion heightened considerably after he had\r\nmade this speech, which conveyed nothing but amazement to the mind of\r\nthe Curate; and then he shook hands hastily, and hurried back again\r\ntowards Grange Lane. If there had been either room or leisure in Frank\r\nWentworth\'s mind for other thoughts, he might have laughed or puzzled\r\nover the palpable mystery; but as it was, he had dismissed the late\r\nRector entirely from his mind before he reached the door of Mr Brown\'s\r\nroom, where the lawyer was seated alone. John Brown, who was\r\naltogether a different type of man from Mr Waters, held out his hand to\r\nhis visitor, and did not look at all surprised to see him. "I have\r\nexpected a call from you," he said, "now that your old friend is gone,\r\nfrom whom you would naturally have sought advice in the circumstances.\r\nTell me what I can do for you;" and it became apparent to Mr Wentworth\r\nthat it was his own affairs which were supposed to be the cause of his\r\napplication. It may be supposed after this that the Curate stated his\r\nreal object very curtly and clearly without any unnecessary words, to\r\nthe unbounded amazement of the lawyer, who, being a busy man, and not a\r\nfriend of the Wodehouses, had as yet heard nothing of the matter. Mr\r\nBrown, however, could only confirm what had been already said. "If it is\r\nreally freehold property, and no settlement made, there cannot be any\r\nquestion about it," he said; "but I will see Waters to-morrow and make\r\nall sure, if you wish it; though he dares not mislead you on such a\r\npoint. I am very sorry for the ladies, but I don\'t see what can be done\r\nfor them," said Mr Brown; "and about yourself, Mr Wentworth?" Perhaps it\r\nwas because of a certain look of genuine confidence and solicitude in\r\nJohn Brown\'s honest face that the Curate\'s heart was moved. For the\r\nfirst time he condescended to discuss the matter--to tell the lawyer,\r\nwith whom indeed he had but a very slight acquaintance (for John Brown\r\nlived at the other end of Carlingford, and could not be said to be in\r\nsociety), all he knew about Rosa Elsworthy, and something of his\r\nsuspicions. Mr Brown, for his part, knew little of the Perpetual Curate\r\nin his social capacity, but he knew about Wharfside, which was more to\r\nthe purpose; and having himself been truly in love once in his life,\r\ncommonplace as he looked, this honest man did not believe it possible\r\nthat Lucy Wodehouse\'s representative could be Rosa Elsworthy\'s\r\nseducer--the two things looked incompatible to the straightforward\r\nvision of John Brown.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll attend at their investigation," he said, with a smile, "which,\r\nif you were not particularly interested, you\'d find not bad fun, Mr\r\nWentworth. These private attempts at law are generally very amusing.\r\nI\'ll attend and look after your interests; but you had better see that\r\nthis Tom Wodehouse,--I remember the scamp--he used to be bad enough\r\nfor anything,--don\'t give you the slip and get out of the way. Find\r\nout if you can where he has been living these two days. I\'ll attend to\r\nthe other matter, too," the lawyer said, cheerfully, shaking hands\r\nwith his new client; and the Curate went away with a vague feeling\r\nthat matters were about to come right somehow, at which he smiled when\r\nhe came to think of it, and saw how little foundation he had for such\r\na hope. But his hands were full of business, and he had no time to\r\nconsider his own affairs at this particular moment. It seemed to him a\r\nkind of profanity to permit Lucy to remain under the same roof with\r\nWodehouse, even though he was her brother; and Mr Proctor\'s inquiries\r\nhad stimulated his own feeling. There was a certain pleasure, besides,\r\nin postponing himself and his own business, however important, to her\r\nand her concerns; and it was with this idea that he proceeded to the\r\nhouse of his aunts, and was conducted to a little private sitting-room\r\nappropriated to the sole use of Miss Leonora, for whom he had asked.\r\nAs he passed the door of the drawing-room, which was ajar, he glanced\r\nin, and saw his aunt Dora bending over somebody who wept, and heard a\r\nfamiliar voice pouring out complaints, the general sound of which was\r\nequally familiar, though he could not make out a word of the special\r\nsubject. Frank was startled, notwithstanding his preoccupations, for\r\nit was the same voice which had summoned him to Wentworth Rectory\r\nwhich now poured out its lamentations in the Miss Wentworths\'\r\ndrawing-room in Carlingford. Evidently some new complication had\r\narisen in the affairs of the family. Miss Leonora was in her room,\r\nbusy with the books of a Ladies\' Association, of which she was\r\ntreasurer. She had a letter before her from the missionary employed by\r\nthe society, which was a very interesting letter, and likely to make a\r\nconsiderable sensation when read before the next meeting. Miss Leonora\r\nwas taking the cream off this piece of correspondence, enjoying at\r\nonce itself and the impression it would make. She was slightly annoyed\r\nwhen her nephew came in to disturb her. "The others are in the\r\ndrawing-room, as usual," she said. "I can\'t imagine what Lewis could\r\nbe thinking of, to bring you here. Louisa\'s coming can make no\r\ndifference to you."\r\n\r\n"So Louisa has come? I thought I heard her voice. What has happened to\r\nbring Louisa here?" said the Curate, who was not sorry to begin with\r\nan indifferent subject. Miss Leonora shook her head and took up her\r\nletter.\r\n\r\n"She is in the drawing-room," said the strong-minded aunt. "If you\r\nhave no particular business with me, Frank, you had better ask\r\nherself: of course, if you want me, I am at your service--but\r\notherwise I am busy, you see."\r\n\r\n"And so am I," said Mr Wentworth, "as busy as a man can be whose\r\ncharacter is at stake. Do you know I am to be tried to-morrow? But\r\nthat is not what I came to ask you about."\r\n\r\n"I wish you would _tell_ me about it," said Miss Leonora. She got up\r\nfrom her writing-table and from the missionary\'s letter, and abandoned\r\nherself to the impulses of nature. "I have heard disagreeable rumours.\r\nI don\'t object to your reserve, Frank, but things seem to be getting\r\nserious. What does it mean?"\r\n\r\nThe Curate had been much braced in his inner man by his short\r\ninterview with John Brown; that, and the representative position he\r\nheld, had made a wonderful change in his feelings: besides, a matter\r\nwhich was about to become so public could not be ignored. "It means\r\nonly that a good many people in Carlingford think me a villain," said\r\nMr Wentworth: "it is not a flattering idea; and it seems to me, I\r\nmust say, an illogical induction from the facts of my life. Still it\r\nis true that some people think so--and I am to be tried to-morrow. But\r\nin the mean time, something else has happened. I know you are a good\r\nwoman, aunt Leonora. We don\'t agree in many things, but that does not\r\nmatter. There are two ladies in Carlingford who up to this day have\r\nbeen rich, well off, well cared for, and who have suddenly lost all\r\ntheir means, their protector, even their home. They have no relations\r\nthat I know of. One of them is good for any exertion that may be\r\nnecessary," said the Curate, his voice softening with a far-off\r\nmasculine suggestion as of tears; "but she is young--too young to\r\ncontend with the world--and she is now suffering her first grief. The\r\nother is old enough, but not good for much--"\r\n\r\n"You mean the two Miss Wodehouses?" said Miss Leonora. "Their father\r\nhas turned out to be--bankrupt?--or something?--"\r\n\r\n"Worse than bankrupt," said the Curate: "there is a brother who takes\r\neverything. Will you stand by them--offer them shelter?--I mean for a\r\ntime. I don\'t know anybody I should care to apply to but you."\r\n\r\nMiss Leonora paused and looked at her nephew. "First tell me what you\r\nhave to do with them," she asked. "If there is a brother, he is their\r\nnatural protector--certainly not you--unless there is something I\r\ndon\'t know of. Frank, you know you can\'t marry," said Miss Leonora,\r\nwith a little vehemence, once more looking in her nephew\'s face.\r\n\r\n"No," said Frank, with momentary bitterness; "I am not likely to make\r\nany mistake about that--at present, at least. The brother is a\r\nreprobate of whom they know nothing. I have no right to consider\r\nmyself their protector--but I am their friend at least," said the\r\nCurate, breaking off with again that softening in his voice. "They may\r\nhave a great many friends, for anything I know; but I have confidence\r\nin you, aunt Leonora: you are not perhaps particularly sympathetic,"\r\nhe went on, with a laugh; "you don\'t condole with Louisa, for\r\ninstance; but I could trust you with--"\r\n\r\n"Lucy Wodehouse!" said Miss Leonora; "I don\'t dislike her at all, if\r\nshe would not wear that ridiculous grey cloak; but young men don\'t\r\ntake such an interest in young women without some reason for it. What\r\nare we to do for you, Frank?" said the strong-minded woman, looking at\r\nhim with a little softness. Miss Leonora, perhaps, was not used to be\r\ntaken into anybody\'s confidence. It moved her more than might have\r\nbeen expected from so self-possessed a woman. Perhaps no other act on\r\nthe part of her nephew could have had so much effect, had he been able\r\nto pursue his advantage, upon the still undecided fate of Skelmersdale.\r\n\r\n"Nothing," said the Curate. He met her eye very steadily, but she was\r\ntoo clear-sighted to believe that he felt as calmly as he looked.\r\n"Nothing," he repeated again--"I told you as much before. I have been\r\nslandered here, and here I must remain. There are no parsonages or\r\nparadises for me."\r\n\r\nWith which speech Mr Wentworth shook hands with his aunt and\r\nwent away. He left Miss Leonora as he had left her on various\r\noccasions--considerably confused in her ideas. She could not enjoy any\r\nlonger the cream of the missionary\'s letter. When she tried to resume\r\nher reading, her attention flagged over it. After a while she put on her\r\nbonnet and went out, after a little consultation with her maid, who\r\nassisted her in the housekeeping department. The house was tolerably\r\nfull at the present moment, but it was elastic. She was met at the green\r\ndoor of Mr Wodehouse\'s garden by the new proprietor, who stared\r\nexcessively, and did not know what to make of such an apparition. "Jack\r\nWentworth\'s aunt, by Jove!" he said to himself, and took off his hat,\r\nmeaning to show her "a little civility." Miss Leonora thought him one of\r\nthe attendants at the recent ceremonial, and passed him without any\r\nceremony. She was quite intent upon her charitable mission. Mr\r\nWentworth\'s confidence was justified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Wentworth\'s day had been closely occupied up to this point. He had\r\ngone through a great many emotions, and transacted a good deal of\r\nbusiness, and he went home with the comparative ease of a man whose\r\nanxieties are relieved, not by any real deliverance, but by the\r\nsoothing influence of fatigue and the sense of something accomplished.\r\nHe was not in reality in a better position than when he left his house\r\nin the morning, bitterly mortified, injured, and wounded at the\r\ntenderest point. Things were very much the same as they had been, but\r\na change had come over the feelings of the Perpetual Curate. He\r\nremembered with a smile, as he went down Grange Lane, that Mr Proctor\r\nwas to dine with him, and that he had rashly undertaken to have\r\nsomething better than a chop. It was a very foolish engagement under\r\nthe circumstances. Mr Wentworth was cogitating within himself whether\r\nhe could make an appeal to the sympathies of his aunt\'s cook for\r\nsomething worthy of the sensitive palate of a Fellow of All-Souls,\r\nwhen all such thoughts were suddenly driven out of his mind by the\r\napparition of his brother Gerald--perhaps the last man in the world\r\nwhom he could have expected to see in Carlingford. Gerald was coming\r\nup Grange Lane in his meditative way from Mrs Hadwin\'s door. To look\r\nat him was enough to reveal to any clear-sighted spectator the\r\npresence of some perpetual argument in his mind. Though he had come\r\nout to look for Frank, his eyes were continually forsaking his\r\nintention, catching spots of lichen on the wall and clumps of herbage\r\non the roadside. The long discussion had become so familiar to him,\r\nthat even now, when his mind was made up, he could not relinquish the\r\nhabit which possessed him. When he perceived Frank, he quickened his\r\nsteps. They met with only such a modified expression of surprise on\r\nthe part of the younger brother as was natural to a meeting of English\r\nkinsfolk. "I heard Louisa\'s voice in my aunt\'s drawing-room," said\r\nFrank; "but, oddly enough, it never occurred to me that you might have\r\ncome with her;" and then Gerald turned with the Curate. When the\r\nordinary family questions were asked and answered, a silence ensued\r\nbetween the two. As for Frank, in the multiplicity of his own cares,\r\nhe had all but forgotten his brother; and Gerald\'s mind, though full\r\nof anxiety, had something of the calm which might be supposed to\r\nsubdue the senses of a dying man. He was on the eve of a change, which\r\nappeared to him almost as great as death; and the knowledge of that\r\ngave him a curious stillness of composure--almost a reluctance to\r\nspeak. Strangely enough, each brother at this critical moment felt it\r\nnecessary to occupy himself with the affairs of the other, and to\r\npostpone the consideration of his own.\r\n\r\n"I hope you have changed your mind a little since we last met," said\r\nFrank; "your last letter--"\r\n\r\n"We\'ll talk of that presently," said the elder brother; "in the mean\r\ntime I want to know about _you_. What is all this? My father is in a\r\ngreat state of anxiety. He does not seem to have got rid of his fancy\r\nthat you were somehow involved with Jack--and Jack is here," said\r\nGerald, with a look which betokened some anxiety on his own part. "I\r\nwish you would give me your confidence. Right or wrong, I have come to\r\nstand by you, Frank," said the Rector of Wentworth, rather mournfully.\r\nHe had been waiting at Mrs Hadwin\'s for the last two hours. He had\r\nseen that worthy woman\'s discomposed looks, and felt that she did not\r\nshake her head for nothing. Jack had been the bugbear of the family\r\nfor a long time past. Gerald was conscious of adding heavily at the\r\npresent moment to the Squire\'s troubles. Charley was at Malta, in\r\nindifferent health; all the others were boys. There was only Frank to\r\ngive the father a little consolation; and now Frank, it appeared, was\r\nmost deeply compromised of all; no wonder Gerald was sad. And then he\r\ndrew forth the anonymous letter which had startled all the Wentworths\r\non the previous night. "This is written by somebody who hates you,"\r\nsaid the elder brother; "but I suppose there must be some meaning in\r\nit. I wish you would be frank with me, and tell me what it is."\r\n\r\nThis appeal had brought them to Mrs Hadwin\'s door, which the Curate\r\nopened with his key before he answered his brother. The old lady\r\nherself was walking in the garden in a state of great agitation, with\r\na shawl thrown over the best cap, which she had put on in honour of\r\nthe stranger. Mrs Hadwin\'s feelings were too much for her at that\r\nmoment. Her head was nodding with the excitement of age, and injured\r\nvirtue trembled in every line of her face. "Mr Wentworth, I cannot put\r\nup with it any longer; it is a thing I never was used to," she cried,\r\nas soon as the Curate came within hearing. "I have shut my eyes to a\r\ngreat deal, but I cannot bear it any longer. If I had been a common\r\nlodging-house keeper, I could not have been treated with less respect;\r\nbut to be outraged--to be insulted--"\r\n\r\n"What is the matter, Mrs Hadwin?" said Mr Wentworth, in dismay.\r\n\r\n"Sir," said the old lady, who was trembling with passion, "you may\r\nthink it no matter to turn a house upside down as mine has been since\r\nEaster; to bring all sorts of disreputable people about--persons whom\r\na gentlewoman in my position ought never to have heard of. I received\r\nyour brother into my house," cried Mrs Hadwin, turning to Gerald,\r\n"because he was a clergyman and I knew his family, and hoped to find\r\nhim one whose principles I could approve of. I have put up with a\r\ngreat deal, Mr Wentworth, more than I could tell to anybody. I took\r\nin his friend when he asked me, and gave him the spare room, though it\r\nwas against my judgment. I suffered a man with a beard to be seen\r\nstealing in and out of my house in the evening, as if he was afraid to\r\nbe seen. You gentlemen may not think much of that, but it was a\r\nterrible thing for a lady in my position, unprotected, and not so well\r\noff as I once was. It made my house like a lodging-house, and so my\r\nfriends told me; but I was so infatuated I put up with it all for Mr\r\nFrank\'s sake. But there _is_ a limit," said the aggrieved woman. "I\r\nwould not have believed it--I _could_ not have believed it of you--not\r\nwhatever people might say: to think of that abandoned disgraceful girl\r\ncoming openly to my door--"\r\n\r\n"Good heavens!" cried the Curate: he seized Mrs Hadwin\'s hand,\r\nevidently forgetting everything else she had said. "What girl?--whom\r\ndo you mean? For heaven\'s sake compose yourself and answer me. Who was\r\nit? Rosa Elsworthy? This is a matter of life and death for me," cried\r\nthe young man. "Speak quickly: when was it?--where is she? For\r\nheaven\'s sake, Mrs Hadwin, speak--"\r\n\r\n"Let me go, sir!" cried the indignant old lady; "let me go this\r\ninstant--this is insult upon insult. I appeal to you, Mr Gerald--to\r\nthink I should ever be supposed capable of encouraging such a horrid\r\nshameless--! How dare you--how dare you name such a creature to me?"\r\nexclaimed Mrs Hadwin, with hysterical sobs. "If it were not for your\r\nfamily, you should never enter my house again. Oh, thank you, Mr\r\nGerald Wentworth--indeed I am not able to walk. I am sure I don\'t want\r\nto grieve you about your brother--I tried not to believe it--I tried\r\nas long as I could not to believe it--but you hear how he speaks. Do\r\nyou think, sir, I would for a moment permit such a creature to enter\r\nmy door?" she cried again, turning to Frank Wentworth as she leaned\r\nupon his brother\'s arm.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what kind of a creature the poor girl is," said the\r\nCurate; "but I know that if you had taken her in, it would have saved\r\nme much pain and trouble. Tell me, at least, when she came, and who\r\nsaw her--or if she left any message? Perhaps Sarah will tell me," he\r\nsaid, with a sigh of despair, as he saw that handmaiden hovering\r\nbehind. Sarah had been a little shy of Mr Wentworth since the night\r\nWodehouse disappeared. She had betrayed herself to the Curate, and did\r\nnot like to remember the fact. Now she came up with a little toss of\r\nher head and a sense of equality, primed and ready with her reply.\r\n\r\n"I hope I think more of myself than to take notice of any sich," said\r\nSarah; but her instincts were more vivid than those of her mistress,\r\nand she could not refrain from particulars. "Them as saw her now,\r\nwouldn\'t see much in her; I never see such a changed creature," said\r\nSarah; "not as I ever thought anything of her looks! a bit of a shawl\r\ndragged around her, and her eyes as if they would jump out of her\r\nhead. Laws! she didn\'t get no satisfaction here," said the housemaid,\r\nwith a little triumph.\r\n\r\n"Silence, Sarah!" said Mrs Hadwin; "that is not a way to speak to your\r\nclergyman. I\'ll go in, Mr Wentworth, please--I am not equal to so much\r\nagitation. If Mr Frank will come indoors, I should be glad to have an\r\nexplanation--for this sort of thing cannot go on," said the old lady.\r\nAs for the Curate he did not pay the least attention either to the\r\ndisapproval or the impertinence.\r\n\r\n"At what time did she come?--which way did she go?--did she leave any\r\nmessage?" he repeated; "a moment\'s common-sense will be of more use\r\nthan all this indignation. It is of the greatest importance to me to\r\nsee Rosa Elsworthy. Here\'s how it is, Gerald," said the Curate, driven\r\nto his wit\'s end; "a word from the girl is all I want to make an end\r\nof all this--this disgusting folly--and you see how I am thwarted.\r\nPerhaps they will answer _you_. When did she come?--did she say\r\nanything?" he cried, turning sharply upon Sarah, who, frightened by Mr\r\nWentworth\'s look, and dismayed to see her mistress moving away, and to\r\nfeel herself alone opposed to him, burst at last into an alarmed\r\nstatement.\r\n\r\n"Please, sir, it aint no fault of mine," said Sarah; "it was Missis as\r\nsaw her. She aint been gone not half an hour. It\'s all happened since\r\nyour brother left. She come to the side-door; Missis wouldn\'t hear\r\nnothing she had got to say, nor let her speak. Oh, Mr Wentworth, don\'t\r\nyou go after her!" cried the girl, following him to the side-door, to\r\nwhich he rushed immediately. Not half an hour gone! Mr Wentworth burst\r\ninto the lane which led up to Grove Street, and where there was not a\r\nsoul to be seen. He went back to Grange Lane, and inspected every\r\ncorner where she could have hid herself. Then, after a pause, he\r\nwalked impetuously up the quiet road, and into Elsworthy\'s shop. Mrs\r\nElsworthy was there alone, occupying her husband\'s place, who had gone\r\nas usual to the railway for the evening papers. She jumped up from the\r\nhigh stool she was seated on when the Curate entered. "Good gracious,\r\nMr Wentworth!" cried the frightened woman, and instinctively called\r\nthe errand-boy, who was the only other individual within hearing. She\r\nwas unprotected, and quite unable to defend herself if he meant\r\nanything; and it was impossible to doubt that there was meaning of the\r\nmost serious and energetic kind in Mr Wentworth\'s face.\r\n\r\n"Has Rosa come back?" he asked. "Is she here? Don\'t stare at me, but\r\nspeak. Has she come back? I have just heard that she was at my house\r\nhalf an hour ago: have you got her safe?"\r\n\r\nIt was at this moment that Wodehouse came lounging in, with his cigar\r\nappearing in the midst of his beard, and a curious look of\r\nself-exhibition and demonstration in his general aspect. When the\r\nCurate, hearing the steps, turned round upon him, he fell back for a\r\nmoment, not expecting such an encounter. Then the vagabond recovered\r\nhimself, and came forward with the swagger which was his only\r\nalternative.\r\n\r\n"I thought you weren\'t on good terms here," said Wodehouse; "who are you\r\nasking after? It\'s a fine evening, and they don\'t seem up to much in my\r\nhouse. I have asked Jack Wentworth to the Blue Boar at seven--will you\r\ncome? I don\'t want to bear any grudge. I don\'t know if they can cook\r\nanything fit to be eaten in my house. It wasn\'t me you were asking\r\nafter?" The fellow came and stood close, shoulder to shoulder, by the\r\nPerpetual Curate. "By Jove, sir! I\'ve as good a right here as you--or\r\nanywhere," he muttered, as Mr Wentworth withdrew from him. He had to say\r\nit aloud to convince himself of the fact; for it was hard, after being\r\nclandestine for half a lifetime, to move about freely in the daylight.\r\nAs for Mr Wentworth, he fixed his eyes full on the new-comer\'s face.\r\n\r\n"I want to know if Rosa has come home," he repeated, in the clearest\r\ntones of his clear voice. "I am told she called at Mrs Hadwin\'s half\r\nan hour ago. Has she come back?"\r\n\r\nHe scarcely noticed Mrs Elsworthy\'s answer, for, in the mean time, the\r\ncigar dropped out of Wodehouse\'s beard, out of his fingers. He made an\r\ninvoluntary step back out of the Curate\'s way. "By Jove!" he exclaimed\r\nto himself--the news was more important to him than to either of the\r\nothers. After a minute he turned his back upon them, and kicked the\r\ncigar which he had dropped out into the street with much blundering\r\nand unnecessary violence--but turned round and stopped short in this\r\noccupation as soon as he heard Mrs Elsworthy\'s voice.\r\n\r\n"She hasn\'t come here," said that virtuous woman, sharply. "I\'ve give\r\nin to Elsworthy a deal, but I never said I\'d give in to take her back.\r\nShe\'s been and disgraced us all; and she\'s not a drop\'s blood to me,"\r\nsaid Mrs Elsworthy. "Them as has brought her to this pass had best\r\nlook after her; I\'ve washed my hands of Rosa, and all belonging to\r\nher. She knows better than to come here."\r\n\r\n"Who\'s speaking of Rosa?" said Elsworthy, who just then came in with\r\nhis bundle of newspapers from the railway. "I might have know\'d as it\r\nwas Mr Wentworth. Matters is going to be cleared, sir, between me and\r\nyou. If you was going to make a proposal, I aint revengeful; and I\'m\r\nopen to any arrangement as is honourable, to save things coming afore\r\nthe public. I\'ve been expecting of it. You may speak free, sir. You\r\nneedn\'t be afraid of me."\r\n\r\n"Fool!" said the Curate, hotly, "your niece has been seen in\r\nCarlingford; she came to my door, I am told, about an hour ago. Give\r\nup this folly, and let us make an effort to find her. I tell you she\r\ncame to my house--"\r\n\r\n"In course, sir," said Elsworthy; "it was the most naturalest place\r\nfor her to go. Don\'t you stand upon it no longer, as if you could\r\ndeceive folks. It will be your ruin, Mr Wentworth--you know that as\r\nwell as I do. I aint no fool but I\'m open to a honourable proposal, I\r\nam. It\'ll ruin you--ay, and I\'ll ruin you," cried Rosa\'s uncle,\r\nhoarsely--"if you don\'t change your mind afore to-morrow. It\'s your\r\nlast chance, if you care for your character, is to-night."\r\n\r\nMr Wentworth did not condescend to make any answer. He followed\r\nWodehouse, who had shuffled out after his cigar, and stopped him on\r\nthe step. "I wonder if it is any use appealing to your honour," he\r\nsaid. "I suppose you were a gentleman once, and had the feelings of--"\r\n\r\n"By Jove! I\'m as good a gentleman as you are," cried the new heir. "I\r\ncould buy you up--you and all that belongs to you, by Jove! I\'m giving\r\nJack Wentworth a dinner at the Blue Boar to-night. I\'m not a man to be\r\ncross-questioned. It appears to me you have got enough to do if you\r\nmind your own business," said Wodehouse, with a sneer. "You\'re in a\r\nnice mess, though you are the parson. I told Jack Wentworth so last\r\nnight."\r\n\r\nThe Curate stood on the step of Elsworthy\'s shop with his enemy\r\nbehind, and the ungrateful vagabond whom he had rescued and guarded,\r\nstanding in front of him, with that sneer on his lips. It was hard to\r\nrefrain from the natural impulse which prompted him to pitch the\r\nvagabond out of his way. "Look here," he said, sharply, "you have not\r\nmuch character to lose; but a scamp is a different thing from a\r\ncriminal. I will make the principal people in Carlingford aware what\r\nwere the precise circumstances under which you came here at Easter if\r\nyou do not immediately restore this unhappy girl to her friends. Do\r\nyou understand me? If it is not done at once I will make use of my\r\ninformation--and you know what that means. You can defy me if you\r\nplease; but in that case you had better make up your mind to the\r\nconsequences; you will have to take your place as a--"\r\n\r\n"Stop!" cried Wodehouse, with a shiver. "We\'re not by ourselves--we\'re\r\nin the public street. What do you mean by talking like that here? Come\r\nto my house, Wentworth--there\'s a good fellow--I\'ve ordered a\r\ndinner--"\r\n\r\n"Be silent, sir!" said the Curate. "I give you till noon to-morrow;\r\nafter that I will spare you no longer. You understand what I mean. I\r\nhave been too merciful already. To-morrow, if everything is not\r\narranged to my satisfaction here--"\r\n\r\n"It was my own name," said Wodehouse, sullenly; "nobody can say it\r\nwasn\'t my own name. You couldn\'t do me any harm--you know you\r\nwouldn\'t, either, for the sake of the girls; I\'ll--I\'ll give them a\r\nthousand pounds or so, if I find I can afford it. Come, you don\'t mean\r\nthat sort of thing, you know," said the conscious criminal; "you\r\nwouldn\'t do me any harm."\r\n\r\n"If I have to fight for my own reputation I shall not spare you,"\r\ncried the Curate. "Mind what I say! You are safe till twelve o\'clock\r\nto-morrow; but after that I will have no mercy--not for your sisters\'\r\nsake, not for any inducement in the world. If you want to be known as\r\na--"\r\n\r\n"Oh Lord, don\'t speak so loud!--what do you mean? Wentworth, I say,\r\nhist! Mr Wentworth! By Jove, he won\'t listen to me!" cried Wodehouse,\r\nin an agony. When he found that the Curate was already out of hearing,\r\nthe vagabond looked round him on every side with his natural instinct\r\nof suspicion. If he had known that Mr Wentworth was thinking only of\r\ndisgrace and the stern sentence of public opinion, Wodehouse could\r\nhave put up with it; but he himself, in his guilty imagination, jumped\r\nat the bar and the prison which had haunted him for long. Somehow it\r\nfelt natural that such a Nemesis should come to him after the\r\nmorning\'s triumph. He stood looking after the Curate, guilty and\r\nhorror-stricken, till it occurred to him that he might be remarked;\r\nand then he made a circuit past Elsworthy\'s shop-window as far as the\r\nend of Prickett\'s Lane, where he ventured to cross over so as to get\r\nto his own house. His own house!--the wretched thrill of terror that\r\nwent through him was a very sufficient offset against his momentary\r\ntriumph; and this was succeeded by a flush of rage as he thought of\r\nthe Curate\'s other information. What was to be done? Every moment was\r\nprecious; but he felt an instinctive horror of venturing out again in\r\nthe daylight. When it approached the hour at which he had ordered that\r\ndinner at the Blue Boar, the humbled hero wrapped himself in an old\r\novercoat which he found in the hall, and slunk into the inn like the\r\nclandestine wretch he was. He had no confidence in himself, but he had\r\nconfidence in Jack Wentworth. He might still be able to help his\r\nunlucky associate out.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr Wentworth reached his rooms, he found that his guest had\r\narrived before him, and consequently the threatened explanation with\r\nMrs Hadwin was forestalled for that night. Mr Proctor and Gerald were\r\nsitting together, not at all knowing what to talk about; for the late\r\nRector was aware that Frank Wentworth\'s brother was on the verge of\r\nRome, and was confused, and could not help feeling that his position\r\nbetween a man on the point of perversion in an ecclesiastical point of\r\nview, and another whose morals were suspected and whose character was\r\ncompromised, was, to say the least, a very odd position for a\r\nclergyman of unblemished orthodoxy and respectability; besides, it was\r\nembarrassing, when he had come for a very private consultation, to\r\nfind a stranger there before him. The Curate went in very full of what\r\nhad just occurred. The events of the last two or three hours had\r\nworked a total change in his feelings. He was no longer the injured,\r\ninsulted, silent object of a petty but virulent persecution. The\r\ncontemptuous silence with which he had treated the scandal at first,\r\nand the still more obstinate sense of wrong which latterly had shut\r\nhis lips and his heart, had given way to-day to warmer and more\r\ngenerous emotions. What would have seemed to him in the morning only\r\nthe indignant reserve of a man unjustly suspected, appeared now a\r\nfoolish and unfriendly reticence. The only thing which restrained him\r\nwas a still lingering inclination to screen Wodehouse, if possible,\r\nfrom a public exposure, which would throw shame upon his sisters as\r\nwell as himself. If any generosity, if any gentlemanly feeling, were\r\nstill left in the vagabond\'s soul, it was possible he might answer the\r\nCurate\'s appeal; and Mr Wentworth felt himself bound to offer no\r\npublic explanation of the facts of the case until this last chance of\r\nescape had been left for the criminal. But, so far as regarded\r\nhimself, his heart was opened, his wounded pride mollified, and he was\r\nready enough to talk of what had just happened, and to explain the\r\nwhole business to his anxious companions. When he joined them, indeed,\r\nhe was so full of it as almost to forget that he himself was still\r\nbelieved the hero of the tale. "This unfortunate little girl has been\r\nhere, and I have missed her," he said, without in the least concealing\r\nhis vexation, and the excitement which his rapid walk had not subdued;\r\nto the great horror of Mr Proctor, who tried all he could, by\r\ntelegraphic glances, to recall the young man to a sense of that fact\r\nthat Sarah was in the room.\r\n\r\n"I must say I think it is imprudent--highly imprudent," said the late\r\nRector: "they will call these women to prove that she has been here\r\nagain; and what conclusion but one can possibly be drawn from such a\r\nfact? I am very sorry to see you so unguarded." He said this, seizing\r\nthe moment after Sarah had removed the salmon, which was very good,\r\nand was served with a sauce which pleased Mr Proctor all the more that\r\nhe had not expected much from an impromptu dinner furnished by a\r\nPerpetual Curate; but the fact was, that Gerald\'s arrival had\r\nawakened Mrs Hadwin to a proper regard for her own credit, which was\r\nat stake.\r\n\r\nWhen Sarah withdrew finally, and they were left alone, Frank Wentworth\r\ngave the fullest explanation he was able to his surprised auditors. He\r\ntold them that it was Wodehouse, and not himself, whom Rosa had met in\r\nthe garden, and whom she had no doubt come to seek at this crisis of\r\ntheir fortunes. There was not the least doubt in his own mind that\r\nWodehouse had carried her away, and hidden her somewhere close at\r\nhand; and when he had given them all his reasons for thinking so, his\r\nhearers were of the same opinion; but Mr Proctor continued very\r\ndoubtful and perplexed, clear though the story was. He sat silent,\r\nbrooding over the new mystery, while the brothers discussed the\r\noriginal questions.\r\n\r\n"I cannot think why you did not go to the Rector at once and tell him\r\nall this," said Gerald. "It is always best to put a stop to gossip. At\r\nleast you will see him to-morrow, or let me see him--"\r\n\r\n"The Rector is deeply prejudiced against me," said the Perpetual Curate,\r\n"for a very unworthy reason, if he has any reason at all. He has never\r\nasked me to explain. I shall not interfere with his investigation," said\r\nthe young man, haughtily; "let it go on. I have been working here for\r\nfive years, and the Carlingford people ought to know better. As for the\r\nRector, I will make no explanations to him."\r\n\r\n"It is not for the Rector, it is for yourself," said Gerald; "and this\r\nfellow Wodehouse surely has no claim--"\r\n\r\nBut at the sound of this name, Mr Proctor roused himself from his\r\npause of bewilderment, and took the words out of Mr Wentworth\'s mouth.\r\n\r\n"He has been here since Easter; but why?" said the late Rector. "I\r\ncannot fancy why Mr Wodehouse\'s son should come to you when his\r\nfather\'s house was so near. In hiding? why was he in hiding? He is\r\nevidently a scamp," said Mr Proctor, growing red; "but that is not so\r\nunusual. I don\'t understand--I am bound to say I don\'t understand it.\r\nHe may be the culprit, as you say; but what was he doing here?"\r\n\r\n"I took him in at Miss Wodehouse\'s request. I cannot explain\r\nwhy--_she_ will tell you," said the Curate. "As for Wodehouse, I have\r\ngiven him another chance till twelve o\'clock to-morrow: if he does not\r\nmake his appearance then--"\r\n\r\nMr Proctor had listened only to the first words; he kept moving\r\nuneasily in his seat while the Curate spoke. Then he broke in, "It\r\nappears I cannot see Miss Wodehouse," he said, with an injured tone;\r\n"she does not see any one. I cannot ask for any explanation; but it\r\nseems to me most extraordinary. It is three months since Easter. If he\r\nhad been living with you all the time, there must have been some\r\noccasion for it. I don\'t know what to think, for my part; and yet I\r\nalways imagined that I was considered a friend of the family," said\r\nthe late Rector, with an aggrieved look. He took his glass of claret\r\nvery slowly, looking at it as if expecting to see in the purple\r\nreflection some explanation of the mystery. As for Gerald Wentworth,\r\nhe relapsed into silence when he found that his arguments did not\r\nalter Frank\'s decision; he too was disappointed not to find his\r\nbrother alone. He sat with his eyes cast down, and a singular look of\r\nabstraction on his face. He had got into a new atmosphere--a different\r\nworld. When his anxieties about Frank were satisfied, Gerald withdrew\r\nhimself altogether from the little party. He sat there, it is true,\r\nnot unaware of what was going on, and even from time to time joining\r\nin the conversation; but already a subtle change had come over Gerald.\r\nHe might have been repeating an "office," or carrying on a course of\r\nprivate devotions, from his looks. Rome had established her dualism in\r\nhis mind. He had no longer the unity of an Englishman trained to do\r\none thing at a time, and to do it with his might. He sat in a kind of\r\nlanguor, carrying on within himself a thread of thought, to which his\r\nexternal occupation gave no clue; yet at the same time suffering no\r\nindication to escape him of the real condition of his mind. The three\r\nwere consequently far from being good company. Mr Proctor, who was\r\nmore puzzled than ever as to the true state of the case, could not\r\nunburden himself of his own intentions as he had hoped to do; and\r\nafter a while the Curate, too, was silent, finding his statements\r\nreceived, as he thought, but coldly. It was a great relief to him when\r\nhe was called out by Sarah to speak to some one, though his absence\r\nmade conversation still more difficult for the two who were left\r\nbehind. Mr Proctor, from the other side of the table, regarded Gerald\r\nwith a mixture of wonder and pity. He did not feel quite sure that it\r\nwas not his duty to speak to him--to expound the superior catholicity\r\nof the Church of England, and call his attention to the schismatic\r\npeculiarities of the Church of Rome. "It might do him good to read\r\nBurgon\'s book," Mr Proctor said to himself; and by way of introducing\r\nthat subject, he began to talk of Italy, which was not a bad device,\r\nand did credit to his invention. Meanwhile the Curate had gone to his\r\nstudy, wondering a little who could want him, and, to his utter\r\nbewilderment, found his aunt Dora, veiled, and wrapped up in a great\r\nshawl.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Frank, my dear, don\'t be angry! I couldn\'t help coming," cried\r\nMiss Dora. "Come and sit down by me here. I slipped out and did not\r\neven put on my bonnet, that nobody might know. Oh, Frank, I don\'t know\r\nwhat to say. I am so afraid you have been wicked. I have just seen\r\nthat--that girl. I saw her out of my window. Frank! don\'t jump up like\r\nthat. I can\'t go on telling you if you don\'t stay quiet here."\r\n\r\n"Aunt, let me understand you," cried the Curate. "You saw whom? Rosa\r\nElsworthy? Don\'t drive me desperate, as all the others do with their\r\nstupidity. You saw her? when?--where?"\r\n\r\n"Oh Frank, Frank! to think it should put you in such a way--such a\r\ngirl as that! Oh, my dear boy, if I had thought you cared so much, I\r\nnever would have come to tell you. It wasn\'t to encourage you--it\r\nwasn\'t. Oh, Frank, Frank! that it should come to this!" cried Miss\r\nDora, shrinking back from him with fright and horror in her face.\r\n\r\n"Come, we have no time to lose," said the Curate, who was desperate.\r\nHe picked up her shawl, which had fallen on the floor, and bundled her\r\nup in it in the most summary way. "Come, aunt Dora," said the\r\nimpetuous young man; "you know you were always my kindest friend.\r\nNobody else can help me at this moment. I feel that you are going to\r\nbe my deliverer. Come, aunt Dora--we must go and find her, you and I.\r\nThere is not a moment to lose."\r\n\r\nHe had his arm round her, holding on her shawl. He raised her up from\r\nher chair, and supported her, looking at her as he had not done before\r\nsince he was a boy at school, Miss Dora thought. She was too\r\nfrightened, too excited, to cry, as she would have liked to do; but\r\nthe proposal was so terrible and unprecedented that she leaned back\r\ntrembling on her nephew\'s arm, and could not move either to obey or to\r\nresist him. "Oh, Frank, I never went after any improper person in my\r\nlife," gasped aunt Dora. "Oh, my dear, don\'t make me do anything that\r\nis wrong; they will say it is my fault!" cried the poor lady,\r\ngradually feeling herself obliged to stand on her feet and collect her\r\nforces. The shawl fell back from her shoulders as the Curate withdrew\r\nhis arm. "You have lost my large pin," cried aunt Dora, in despair;\r\n"and I have no bonnet. And oh! what will Leonora say? I never, never\r\nwould have come to tell you if I had thought of this. I only came to\r\nwarn you, Frank. I only intended--"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said the Curate. The emergency was momentous, and he dared not\r\nlose patience. He found her large pin even, while she stood trembling,\r\nand stuck it into her shawl as if it had been a skewer. "You never\r\nwould have come if you had not been my guardian angel," said the\r\ndeceitful young man, whose heart was beating high with anxiety and\r\nhope. "Nobody else would do for me what you are going to do--but I\r\nhave always had confidence in my aunt Dora. Come, come! We have not a\r\nmoment to lose."\r\n\r\nThis was how he overcame Miss Dora\'s scruples. Before she knew what\r\nhad happened she was being hurried through the clear summer night past\r\nthe long garden-walls of Grange Lane. The stars were shining overhead,\r\nthe leaves rustling on all sides in the soft wind--not a soul to be\r\nseen in the long line of darkling road. Miss Dora had no breath to\r\nspeak, however much disposed she might have been. She could not\r\nremonstrate, having full occasion for all her forces to keep her feet\r\nand her breath. When Mr Wentworth paused for an instant to ask "which\r\nway did she go?" it was all Miss Dora could do to indicate with her\r\nfinger the dark depths of Prickett\'s Lane. Thither she was immediately\r\ncarried as by a whirlwind. With a shawl over her head, fastened\r\ntogether wildly by the big pin--with nothing but little satin\r\nslippers, quite unfit for the exertion required of them--with an\r\nagonised protest in her heart that she had never, never in her life\r\ngone after any improper person before--and, crowning misfortune of\r\nall, with a horrible consciousness that she had left the garden-door\r\nopen, hoping to return in a few minutes, Miss Dora Wentworth, single\r\nwoman as she was, and ignorant of evil, was whirled off in pursuit of\r\nthe unfortunate Rosa into the dark abysses of Prickett\'s Lane.\r\n\r\nWhile this terrible Hegira was taking place, Mr Proctor sat opposite\r\nGerald Wentworth, sipping his claret and talking of Italy. "Perhaps\r\nyou have not read Burgon\'s book," said the late Rector. "There is a\r\ngood deal of valuable information in it about the Catacombs, and he\r\nenters at some length into the question between the Roman Church and\r\nour own. If you are interested in that, you should read it," said Mr\r\nProctor; "it is a very important question."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Gerald; and then there followed a pause. Mr Proctor did\r\nnot know what to make of the faint passing smile, the abstracted look,\r\nwhich he had vaguely observed all the evening; and he looked so\r\ninquiringly across the table that Gerald\'s new-born dualism came\r\nimmediately into play, to the great amazement of his companion. Mr\r\nWentworth talked, and talked well; but his eyes were still abstracted,\r\nhis mind was still otherwise occupied; and Mr Proctor, whose own\r\nintelligence was in a state of unusual excitement, perceived the fact\r\nwithout being at all able to explain it. An hour passed, and both the\r\ngentlemen looked at their watches. The Curate had left them abruptly\r\nenough, with little apology; and as neither of them had much interest\r\nin the other, nor in the conversation, it was natural that the host\'s\r\nreturn should be looked for with some anxiety. When the two gentlemen\r\nhad said all they could say about Italy--when Mr Proctor had given a\r\nlittle sketch of his own experiences in Rome, to which his companion\r\ndid not make the usual response of narrating his--the two came to a\r\ndead pause. They had now been sitting for more than two hours over\r\nthat bottle of Lafitte, many thoughts having in the mean time crossed\r\nMr Proctor\'s mind concerning the coffee and the Curate. Where could he\r\nhave gone? and why was there not somebody in the house with sense\r\nenough to clear away the remains of dessert, and refresh the wearied\r\ninterlocutors with the black and fragrant cup which cheers all\r\nstudents? Both of the gentlemen had become seriously uneasy by this\r\ntime; the late Rector got up from the table when he could bear it no\r\nlonger. "Your brother must have been called away by something\r\nimportant," said Mr Proctor, stiffly. "Perhaps you will kindly make my\r\nexcuses. Mr Morgan keeps very regular hours, and I should not like to\r\nbe late--"\r\n\r\n"It is very extraordinary. I can\'t fancy what can be the reason--it\r\nmust be somebody sick," said Gerald, rising too, but not looking by\r\nany means sure that Frank\'s absence had such a laudable excuse.\r\n\r\n"Very likely," said the late Rector, more stiffly than ever. "You are\r\nliving here, I suppose?"\r\n\r\n"No; I am at Miss Wentworth\'s--my aunt\'s," said Gerald. "I will walk\r\nwith you;" and they went out together with minds considerably excited.\r\nBoth looked up and down the road when they got outside the garden-gate:\r\nboth had a vague idea that the Curate might be visible somewhere in\r\nconversation with somebody disreputable; and one being his friend and\r\nthe other his brother, they were almost equally disturbed about the\r\nunfortunate young man. Mr Proctor\'s thoughts, however, were mingled with\r\na little offence. He had meant to be confidential and brotherly, and the\r\noccasion had been lost; and how was it possible to explain the rudeness\r\nwith which Mr Wentworth had treated him? Gerald was still more seriously\r\ntroubled. When Mr Proctor left him, he walked up and down Grange Lane in\r\nthe quiet of the summer night, watching for his brother. Jack came home\r\nsmoking his cigar, dropping Wodehouse, whom the heir of the Wentworths\r\ndeclined to call his friend, before he reached his aunts\' door, and as\r\nmuch surprised as it was possible for him to be, to find Gerald\r\nlingering, meditating, along the silent road; but still Frank did\r\nnot come. By-and-by a hurried light gleamed in the window of the\r\nsummer-house, and sounds of commotion were audible in the orderly\r\ndwelling of the Miss Wentworths; and the next thing that happened was\r\nthe appearance of Miss Leonora, also with a shawl over her head, at the\r\ngarden-door. Just then, when they were all going to bed, Collins, Miss\r\nDora\'s maid, had come to the drawing-room in search of her mistress. She\r\nwas not to be found anywhere, though her bonnets and all her outdoor\r\ngear were safe in their place. For the first time in her life the entire\r\nfamily were startled into anxiety on Miss Dora\'s account. As for Mrs\r\nGerald Wentworth, she jumped at once to the conclusion that the poor\r\nlady was murdered, and that Frank must have something to do with it, and\r\nfilled the house with lamentations. Nobody went to bed, not even aunt\r\nCecilia, who had not been out of her room at eleven o\'clock for\r\ncenturies. Collins had gone into the summer-house and was turning over\r\neverything there as if she expected to find her mistress\'s body in the\r\ncupboard or under the sofa; Lewis, the butler, was hunting through the\r\ngarden with a lantern, looking under all the bushes. No incident so\r\nutterly unaccountable had occurred before in Miss Dora Wentworth\'s life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first investigation into the character of the Rev. F. C.\r\nWentworth, Curate of St Roque\'s was fixed to take place in the vestry\r\nof the parish church, at eleven o\'clock on the morning of the day\r\nwhich followed this anxious night. Most people in Carlingford were\r\naware that the Perpetual Curate was to be put upon his trial on that\r\nsunny July morning; and there was naturally a good deal of curiosity\r\namong the intelligent townsfolk to see how he looked, and what was the\r\naspect of the witnesses who were to bear testimony for or against him.\r\nIt is always interesting to the crowd to see how a man looks at a\r\ngreat crisis of his life--or a woman either, for that matter; and if a\r\nhuman creature, at the height of joy, or in the depths of sorrow, is a\r\nspectacle to draw everybody\'s eyes, there is a still greater dramatic\r\ninterest in the sight when hope and fear are both in action, and the\r\nalternative hangs between life or death. It was life or death to Mr\r\nWentworth, though the tribunal was one which could inflict no\r\npenalties. If he should be found guilty, death would be a light doom\r\nto the downfall and moral extinction which would make an end of the\r\nunfaithful priest; and, consequently, Carlingford had reason for its\r\ncuriosity. There was a crowd about the back entrance which led to the\r\nshabby little sacristy where Mr Morgan and Mr Leeson were accustomed\r\nto robe themselves; and scores of people strayed into the church\r\nitself, and hung about, pretending to look at the improvements which\r\nthe Rector called restorations. Mrs Morgan herself, looking very pale,\r\nwas in and out half-a-dozen times in the hour, talking with terrible\r\nscience and technicalism to Mr Finial\'s clerk of works, who could not\r\nmake her see that she was talking Gothic--a language which had nothing\r\nto do with Carlingford Church, that building being of the Revolution\r\nor churchwarden epoch. She was a great deal too much agitated at that\r\nmoment to be aware of the distinction. As for Mr Wentworth, it was\r\nuniversally agreed that, though he looked a little flushed and\r\nexcited, there was no particular discouragement visible in his face.\r\nHe went in to the vestry with some eagerness, not much like a culprit\r\non his trial. The Rector, indeed, who was heated and embarrassed and\r\ndoubtful of himself, looked more like a criminal than the real hero.\r\nThere were six of the amateur judges, of whom one had felt his heart\r\nfail him at the last moment. The five who were steadfast were Mr\r\nMorgan, Dr Marjoribanks, old Mr Western (who was a distant cousin of\r\nthe Wodehouses, and brother-in-law, though old enough to be her\r\ngrandfather, of the beautiful Lady Western, who once lived in Grange\r\nLane), and with them Mr Centum, the banker, and old Colonel Chiley. Mr\r\nProctor, who was very uneasy in his mind, and much afraid lest he\r\nshould be called upon to give an account of the Curate\'s behaviour on\r\nthe previous night, had added himself as a kind of auxiliary to this\r\njudicial bench. Mr Waters had volunteered his services as counsellor,\r\nperhaps with the intention of looking after the interests of a very\r\ndifferent client; and to this imposing assembly John Brown had walked\r\nin, with his hands in his pockets, rather disturbing the composure of\r\nthe company in general, who were aware what kind of criticism his\r\nwas. While the bed of justice was being arranged, a very odd little\r\ngroup collected in the outer room, where Elsworthy, in a feverish\r\nstate of excitement, was revolving about the place from the door to\r\nthe window, and where the Miss Hemmings sat up against the wall, with\r\ntheir drapery drawn up about them, to show that they were of different\r\nclay from Mrs Elsworthy, who, respectful but sullen, sat on the same\r\nbench. The anxious public peered in at the door whenever it had a\r\nchance, and took peeps through the window when the other privilege was\r\nimpossible. Besides the Miss Hemmings and the Elsworthys there was\r\nPeter Hayles, who also had seen something, and the wife of another\r\nshopkeeper at the end of George Street; and there was the Miss\r\nHemmings\' maid, who had escorted them on that eventful night of Rosa\'s\r\ndisappearance. Not one of the witnesses had the smallest doubt as to\r\nthe statement he or she was about to make; they were entirely\r\nconvinced of the righteousness of their own cause, and the justice of\r\nthe accusation, which naturally gave a wonderful moral force to their\r\ntestimony. Besides--but that was quite a different matter--they all\r\nhad their little grudges against Mr Wentworth, each in his secret\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nWhen Elsworthy was called in to the inner room it caused a little\r\ncommotion amid this company outside. The Miss Hemmings looked at each\r\nother, not with an agreeable expression of face. "They might have had\r\nthe politeness to call us first," Miss Sophia said to her sister; and\r\nMiss Hemmings shook her head and sighed, and said, "Dear Mr Bury!" an\r\nobservation which meant a great deal, though it did not seem perfectly\r\nrelevant. "Laws! I\'ll forget everything when I\'m took in there," said\r\nthe shopkeeper\'s wife to Miss Hemmings\' maid; and the ladies drew\r\nstill closer up, superior to curiosity, while the others stretched\r\ntheir necks to get a peep into the terrible inner room.\r\n\r\nIt was indeed a formidable tribunal. The room was small, so that the\r\nunfortunate witness was within the closest range of six pairs of\r\njudicial eyes, not to speak of the vigilant orbs of the two lawyers,\r\nand those of the accused and his supporters. Mr Morgan, by right of\r\nhis position, sat at the end of the table, and looked very severely at\r\nthe first witness as he came in--which Elsworthy did, carrying his hat\r\nbefore him like a kind of shield, and polishing it carefully round and\r\nround. The Rector was far from having any intention of discouraging\r\nthe witness, who was indeed his mainstay; but the anxiety of his\r\npeculiar position, as being at once counsel for the prosecution, and\r\nchief magistrate of the bed of justice, gave an unusual sternness to\r\nhis face.\r\n\r\n"Your name is George Elsworthy," said the Rector, filling his pen with\r\nink, and looking penetratingly in the witness\'s face.\r\n\r\n"George Appleby Elsworthy," said Rosa\'s uncle, a little alarmed; "not\r\nas I often signs in full; for you see, sir, it\'s a long name, and\r\nlife\'s short, and it aint necessary in the way of business--"\r\n\r\n"Stationer and newsmonger in Carlingford," interrupted the Rector; "I\r\nshould say in Upper Grange Lane, Carlingford; aged--?"\r\n\r\n"But it doesn\'t appear to me that newsmonger is a correct expression,"\r\nsaid old Mr Western, who was very conversational; "newsmonger means a\r\ngossip, not a tradesman; not that there is any reason why a tradesman\r\nshould not be a gossip, but--"\r\n\r\n"Aged?" said Mr Morgan, holding his pen suspended in the air. "I will\r\nsay newsvendor if that will be better--one cannot be too\r\nparticular--Aged--?"\r\n\r\n"He is come to years of discretion," said Dr Marjoribanks, "that\'s all\r\nwe need; don\'t keep us all day waiting, man, but tell your story about\r\nthis elopement of your niece. When did it take place, and what are the\r\nfacts? Never mind your hat, but say out what you have got to say."\r\n\r\n"You are much too summary, Doctor," said Mr Morgan, with a little\r\noffence; but the sense of the assembly was clearly with Dr\r\nMarjoribanks--so that the Rector dashed in 45 as the probable age of\r\nthe witness, and waited his further statement.\r\n\r\nAfter this there was silence, and Elsworthy began his story. He\r\nnarrated all the facts of Rosa\'s disappearance, with an intention and\r\nbias which made his true tale a wonderful tacit accusation. Rage,\r\nrevenge, a sense of wrong, worked what in an indifferent narrator only\r\nthe highest skill could have wrought. He did not mention the Curate\'s\r\nname, but arranged all his facts in lines like so many trains of\r\nartillery. How Rosa was in the habit of going to Mrs Hadwin\'s (it was\r\ncontrary to Elsworthy\'s instinct to bring in at this moment any\r\nreference to Mr Wentworth) every night with the newspaper--"not as I\r\nsent her of errands for common--keeping two boys for the purpose,"\r\nsaid the injured man; "but, right or wrong, there\'s where she\'d go as\r\ncertain as the night come. I\'ve seen her with my own eyes go into Mrs\r\nHadwin\'s garden-door, which she hadn\'t no need to go in but for being\r\nencouraged; and it would be half an hour at the least afore she came\r\nout."\r\n\r\n"But, bless me! that was very imprudent of you," cried Mr Proctor, who\r\nup to this time had not uttered a word.\r\n\r\n"There was nobody there but the old lady and her maids--except the\r\nclergyman," said Elsworthy. "It wasn\'t my part to think as she could\r\nget any harm from the clergyman. She wouldn\'t hear no remonstrances\r\nfrom me; she _would_ go as regular as the evening come."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes," said Mr Waters, who saw John Brown\'s humorous eye gleaming\r\nround upon the little assembly; "but let us come to the immediate\r\nmatter in hand. Your niece disappeared from Carlingford on the--?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes," said Mr Western, "we must not sink into conversation;\r\nthat\'s the danger of all unofficial investigations. It seems natural\r\nto let him tell his story as he likes: but here we have got somebody\r\nto keep us in order. It\'s natural, but it aint law--is it, Brown?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see that law has anything to do with it," said John Brown,\r\nwith a smile.\r\n\r\n"Order! order!" said the Rector, who was much goaded and aggravated by\r\nthis remark. "I request that there may be no conversation. The witness\r\nwill proceed with what he has to say. Your niece disappeared on the\r\n15th. What were the circumstances of her going away?"\r\n\r\n"She went down as usual with the newspaper," said Elsworthy; "it had got\r\nto be a custom as regular as regular. She stopped out later nor common,\r\nand my wife and me was put out. I don\'t mind saying, gentlemen," said\r\nthe witness, with candour, "as my missis and I wasn\'t altogether of the\r\nsame mind about Rosa. She was late, but I can\'t say as I was anxious. It\r\nwasn\'t above a week afore that Mr Wentworth himself brought her home\r\nsafe, and it was well known as he didn\'t like her to be out at night; so\r\nI was easy in my mind, like. But when eleven o\'clock came, and there was\r\nno denying of its being past hours, I began to get a little fidgety. I\r\nstepped out to the door, and I looked up and down, and saw nobody; so I\r\ntook up my hat and took a turn down the road--"\r\n\r\nAt this moment there was a little disturbance outside. A voice at\r\nwhich the Curate started was audible, asking entrance. "I must see Mr\r\nWentworth immediately," this voice said, as the door was partially\r\nopened; and then, while his sons both rose to their feet, the Squire\r\nhimself suddenly entered the room. He looked round upon the assembled\r\ncompany with a glance of shame and grief that went to the Curate\'s\r\nheart. Then he bowed to the judges, who were looking at him with an\r\nuncomfortable sense of his identity, and walked across the room to the\r\nbench on which Gerald and Frank were seated together. "I beg your\r\npardon, gentlemen," said the Squire, "if I interrupt your proceedings;\r\nbut I have only this moment arrived in Carlingford, and heard what was\r\ngoing on, and I trust I may be allowed to remain, as my son\'s honour\r\nis concerned." Mr Wentworth scarcely waited for the assent which\r\neverybody united in murmuring, but seated himself heavily on the\r\nbench, as if glad to sit down anywhere. He suffered Frank to grasp his\r\nhand, but scarcely gave it; nor, indeed, did he look, except once,\r\nwith a bitter momentary glance at the brothers. They were sons a\r\nfather might well have been proud of, so far as external appearances\r\nwent; but the Squire\'s soul was bitter within him. One was about to\r\nabandon all that made life valuable in the eyes of the sober-minded\r\ncountry gentleman. The other--"And I could have sworn by Frank," the\r\nmortified father was saying in his heart. He sat down with a dull\r\ndogged composure. He meant to hear it all, and have it proved to him\r\nthat his favourite son was a villain. No wonder that he was\r\ndisinclined to respond to any courtesies. He set himself down almost\r\nwith impatience that the sound of his entrance should have interrupted\r\nthe narrative, and looked straight in front of him, fixing his eyes on\r\nElsworthy, and taking no notice of the anxious glances of the possible\r\nculprit at his side.\r\n\r\n"I hadn\'t gone above a step or two when I see Mr Hayles at his door. I\r\nsaid to him, \'It\'s a fine evening,\'--as so it was, and the stars\r\nshining. \'My Rosa aint been about your place, has she?\' I says; and he\r\nsays, \'No.\' But, gentlemen, I see by the look of his eye as he had\r\nmore to say. \'Aint she come home yet?\' says Mr Hayles--"\r\n\r\n"Stop a moment," said John Brown. "Peter Hayles is outside, I think.\r\nIf the Rector wishes to preserve any sort of legal form in this\r\ninquiry, may I suggest that a conversation repeated is not evidence?\r\nLet Elsworthy tell what he knows, and the other can speak for\r\nhimself."\r\n\r\n"It is essential we should hear the conversation," said the Rector,\r\n"since I believe it was of importance. I believe it is an important\r\nlink in the evidence--I believe--"\r\n\r\n"Mr Morgan apparently has heard the evidence before," said the\r\ninexorable John Brown.\r\n\r\nHere a little commotion arose in the bed of justice. "Hush, hush,"\r\nsaid Dr Marjoribanks; "the question is, What has the witness got to\r\nsay of his own knowledge? Go on, Elsworthy; we can\'t possibly spend\r\nthe whole day here. Never mind what Hayles said, unless he\r\ncommunicated something about the girl."\r\n\r\n"He told me as the Miss Hemmings had seen Rosa," said Elsworthy,\r\nslowly; "had seen her at nine, or half after nine--I won\'t be sure\r\nwhich--at Mrs Hadwin\'s gate."\r\n\r\n"The Miss Hemmings are outside. Let the Miss Hemmings be called," said\r\nMr Proctor, who had a great respect for Mr Brown\'s opinion.\r\n\r\nBut here Mr Waters interposed. "The Miss Hemmings will be called\r\npresently," he said; "in the mean time let this witness be heard out;\r\nafterwards his evidence will be corroborated. Go on, Elsworthy."\r\n\r\n"The Miss Hemmings had seen my Rosa at Mrs Hadwin\'s gate," repeated\r\nElsworthy, "a-standing outside, and Mr Wentworth a-standing inside;\r\nthere aint more respectable parties in all Carlingford. It was them as\r\nsaw it, not me. Gentlemen, I went back home. I went out again. I went\r\nover all the town a-looking for her. Six o\'clock in the morning come,\r\nand I had never closed an eye, nor took off my clothes, nor even sat\r\ndown upon a chair. When it was an hour as I could go to a gentleman\'s\r\nhouse and no offence, I went to the place as she was last seen. Me and\r\nMr Hayles, we went together. The shutters was all shut but on one\r\nwindow, which was Mr Wentworth\'s study. We knocked at the garden-door,\r\nand I aint pretending that we didn\'t make a noise; and, gentlemen, it\r\nwasn\'t none of the servants--it was Mr Wentworth hisself as opened the\r\ndoor."\r\n\r\nThere was here a visible sensation among the judges. It was a point\r\nthat told. As for the Squire, he set his stick firmly before him, and\r\nleaned his clasped hands upon it to steady himself. His healthful,\r\nruddy countenance was paling gradually. If it had been an apostle who\r\nspoke, he could not have taken in more entirely the bitter tale.\r\n\r\n"It was Mr Wentworth hisself, gentlemen," said the triumphant witness;\r\n"not like a man roused out of his sleep, but dressed and shaved, and\r\nhis hair brushed, as if it had been ten instead o\' six. It\'s well\r\nknown in Carlingford as he aint an early man; and gentlemen here knows\r\nit as well as me. I don\'t pretend as I could keep my temper. I give\r\nhim my mind, gentlemen, being an injured man; but I said as--if he do\r\nhis duty by her--"\r\n\r\n"Softly a moment," said Mr Brown. "What had Mr Wentworth\'s aspect at\r\nsix o\'clock in the morning to do with Rosa Elsworthy\'s disappearance\r\nat nine on the previous night?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see that the question is called for at the present moment,"\r\nsaid Mr Waters. "Let us hear what reasons you have for attributing to\r\nMr Wentworth an unusual degree of interest in your niece."\r\n\r\n"Sir," said Elsworthy, "he come into my shop as regular as the day; he\r\nnever come but he asked after Rosa, or spoke to her if she was there.\r\nOne night he walked all the way up Grange Lane and knocked at my door\r\nand brought her in all of a glow, and said I wasn\'t to send her out\r\nlate no more. My missis, being a woman as is very particular, was\r\nstruck, and thought as harm might come of it; and, not to be talked\r\nof, we sent Rosa away. And what does Mr Wentworth do, but the moment\r\nhe hears of it comes right off to my shop! He had been at his own\r\nhome, sir, a-visiting his respected family," said Elsworthy, turning\r\nslightly towards the side of the room where the father and sons sat\r\ntogether. "He came to my shop with his carpet-bag as he come off the\r\nrailway, and he gave me my orders as I was to bring Rosa back. What he\r\nsaid was, \'Directly,\' that very day. I never had no thought but what\r\nhis meaning was honourable--being a clergyman," said the witness, with\r\na heavy sigh; and then there ensued a little pause.\r\n\r\n"The Miss Hemmings had better be called now," said Mr Waters.\r\n"Elsworthy, you can retire; but we may require you again, so you had\r\nbetter not go away. Request Miss Hemmings to do us the favour of\r\ncoming here."\r\n\r\nThe Squire lifted his heavy eyes when the next witness entered. She\r\nmade a very solemn curtsy to the gentlemen, and sat down on the chair\r\nwhich somebody placed for her. Being unsupported, a lady--not to say\r\nan unmarried lady profoundly conscious of the fact--among a number of\r\nmen, Miss Hemmings was naturally much agitated. She was the eldest and\r\nthe softest-hearted; and it occurred to her for the first time, as she\r\ngave a frightened look towards the Curate, that he was like her\r\nfavourite younger brother, who had died ever so many years ago--a\r\nthought which, for the first time, made her doubtful of her testimony,\r\nand disposed to break down in her evidence.\r\n\r\n"You were in Grange Lane on the evening of the 15th ultimo," said Mr\r\nMorgan, after he had carefully written down her name, "about nine\r\no\'clock?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, Mr Morgan," said the poor lady; "we were at St Roque\'s\r\nCottage drinking tea with Mrs Bland, who was lodging with Mrs Smith in\r\nthe same rooms Mrs Rider used to have. I put the note of invitation in\r\nmy pocket in case there should be any doubt; but, indeed, poor Mrs\r\nBland was taken very ill on the 16th, and Dr Marjoribanks was called,\r\nand he knows it could not be any other evening--and besides--"\r\n\r\n"About nine o\'clock," said Mr Waters; "did I understand you, it was\r\nabout nine o\'clock?"\r\n\r\n"She was such an invalid, poor dear," said Miss Hemmings,\r\napologetically; "and it is such a privilege to have real Christian\r\nconversation. We dined early on purpose, and we were asked for\r\nhalf-past six. I think it must have been a little after nine; but Mary\r\nis here, and she knows what hour she came for us. Shall I call Mary,\r\nplease?"\r\n\r\n"Presently," said the counsel for the prosecution. "Don\'t be\r\nagitated; one or two questions will do. You passed Mrs Hadwin\'s door\r\ncoming up. Will you kindly tell the gentlemen what you saw there?"\r\n\r\n"Oh!" cried Miss Hemmings. She looked round at the Curate again, and\r\nhe was more than ever like Willie who died. "I--I don\'t take much\r\nnotice of what I see in the streets," she said, faltering; "and there\r\nare always so many poor people going to see Mr Wentworth." Here the\r\npoor lady stopped short. She had never considered before what harm her\r\nevidence might do. Now her heart smote her for the young man who was\r\nlike Willie. "He is so very kind to all the poor people," continued\r\nthe unwilling witness, looking doubtfully round into all the faces\r\nnear her; "and he\'s such a young man," she added, in her tremulous\r\nway. It was Miss Sophia who was strong-minded; all the poor women in\r\nBack Grove Street were perfectly aware that their chances were doubled\r\nwhen they found Miss Jane.\r\n\r\n"But you must tell us what you saw all the same," said Dr Marjoribanks.\r\n"I daresay Mr Wentworth wishes it as much as we do."\r\n\r\nThe Curate got up and came forward with one of his impulses. "I wish\r\nit a great deal more," he said. "My dear Miss Hemmings, thank you for\r\nyour reluctance to say anything to harm me; but the truth can\'t\r\npossibly harm me: tell them exactly what you saw."\r\n\r\nMiss Hemmings looked from one to another, and trembled more and more. "I\r\nam sure I never meant to injure Mr Wentworth," she said; "I only said I\r\nthought it was imprudent of him--that was all I meant. Oh, I am sure, if\r\nI had thought of this, I would rather have done anything than say it.\r\nAnd whatever Sophia might have imagined, I assure you, gentlemen, _I_\r\nnever, never for a moment thought Mr Wentworth meant any harm."\r\n\r\n"Never mind Mr Wentworth," said Mr Brown, who now took the matter in\r\nhand. "When you were passing Mrs Hadwin\'s house about nine o\'clock on\r\nthe evening of the 15th, you saw some one standing at the door. Mr\r\nWentworth particularly wishes you to say who it was."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr Brown--oh, Mr Morgan," cried the poor lady; "it was little\r\nRosa Elsworthy. She was a designing little artful thing. When she was\r\nin my Sunday class, she was always thinking of her vanities. Mr\r\nWentworth was talking to her at the garden-door. I daresay he was\r\ngiving her good advice; and oh, gentlemen, if you were to question me\r\nfor ever and ever, that is all I have got to say."\r\n\r\n"Did you not hear what they were talking about?" said Mr Proctor. "If it\r\nwas good advice--" The late Rector stopped short, and grew red, and felt\r\nthat his supposition was that of a simpleton. "You heard what they were\r\ntalking about? What did they say?" he concluded, peremptorily, in a tone\r\nwhich frightened the reluctant witness more and more.\r\n\r\n"I did not hear a single word," she cried--"not a word. That is all I\r\nknow about it. Oh, please, let me go away. I feel very faint. I should\r\nlike a little cold water, please. I did not hear a word--not a word. I\r\nhave told you everything I have got to say."\r\n\r\nEverybody looked more serious when Miss Hemmings stumbled from her\r\nchair. She was so frightened at her own testimony, and so unwilling to\r\ngive it, that its importance was doubled in the eyes of the\r\ninexperienced judges. The Squire gave a low groan under his breath,\r\nand turned his eyes, which had been fixed upon her, on the ground\r\ninstead; but raised them immediately, with a gleam of anxiety as his\r\nson again rose from his side. All that the Curate meant to do was to\r\ngive the trembling lady his arm, and lead her out; but the entire\r\nassembly, with the exception of John Brown, started and stared as if\r\nhe had been about to take instant revenge upon the frightened woman.\r\nMiss Hemmings burst into tears when Mr Wentworth set a chair for her\r\nby the door, and brought her a glass of water, in the outer room; and\r\njust then somebody knocked and gave him a note, with which he returned\r\nto the presence of the awful tribunal. Miss Sophia Hemmings was\r\ncorroborating her sister\'s statement when the Perpetual Curate\r\nre-entered. He stood behind her quite quietly, until she had finished,\r\nwith a slight smile upon his lips, and the note in his hand. Dr\r\nMarjoribanks was not partial to Miss Sophia Hemmings. She was never\r\nill herself, and rarely permitted even her sister to enjoy the gentle\r\nsatisfaction of a day\'s sickness. The old Doctor looked instead at the\r\nPerpetual Curate. When Miss Hemmings withdrew, Dr Marjoribanks\r\ninterposed. "It appears to me that Mr Wentworth has something to say,"\r\nsaid the Doctor. "It is quite necessary that he should have a hearing\r\nas well as the rest of us. Let Peter Hayles wait a moment, till we\r\nhear what Mr Wentworth has to say."\r\n\r\n"It is not yet time for us to receive Mr Wentworth\'s statement," said\r\nthe Rector. "He shall certainly be heard in his own defence at the\r\nproper time. Mr Waters, call Peter Hayles."\r\n\r\n"One moment," said the Curate. "I have no statement to make, and I can\r\nwait till you have heard what everybody has to say, if the Rector\r\nwishes it; but it might save time and trouble to hear me. I have\r\nanother witness whom, up to this moment, I have been reluctant to\r\nbring forward--a witness all-important for me, whom I cannot produce\r\nin so public a place, or at an hour when everybody is abroad. If you\r\nwill do me the favour to adjourn this inquiry till the evening, and to\r\nmeet then in a private house--in my own, or Miss Wentworth\'s, or\r\nwherever you may appoint--I think I can undertake to make this whole\r\nbusiness perfectly clear."\r\n\r\n"Bless me!" said Mr Proctor, suddenly. This unexpected and irrelevant\r\nbenediction was the first sound distinctly audible in the little stir\r\nof surprise, expectation, and excitement which followed the Curate\'s\r\nspeech. The Squire let his stick fall out of his hands, and groped\r\nafter it to pick it up again. Hope had suddenly all at once come into\r\npossession of the old man\'s breast. As for the Rector, he was too much\r\nannoyed at the moment to speak.\r\n\r\n"You should have thought of this before," said Dr Marjoribanks. "It\r\nwould have been just as easy to fix this meeting for the evening, and\r\nin a private house, and would have saved time. You are very welcome to\r\nmy dining-room, if you please; but I don\'t understand why it could not\r\nhave been settled so at once, and saved our time," said the Doctor; to\r\nwhich sentiment there were several murmurs of assent.\r\n\r\n"Gentlemen," said the Curate, whose eyes were sparkling with\r\nexcitement, "you must all know in your hearts that this trial ought\r\nnever to have taken place. I have lived among you for five years, and\r\nyou ought to have known me by this time. I have never been asked for\r\nan explanation, neither could any explanation which it was possible\r\nfor me to make have convinced a mind prejudiced against me," he said,\r\nafter a moment\'s pause, with a meaning which everybody understood. "It\r\nis only now that I feel myself able to clear up the whole matter, and\r\nit is for this reason alone that I ask you to put off your inquiry\r\ntill to-night."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t feel inclined to consent to any adjournment," said Mr Morgan;\r\n"it looks like an attempt to defeat the ends of justice." The Rector was\r\nvery much annoyed--more than he dared confess to himself. He believed in\r\nhis heart that young Wentworth was guilty, and he felt equally convinced\r\nthat here was some unexpected loophole through which he would escape.\r\nBut public opinion was strong in Grange Lane--stronger than a new\r\nRector. The Banker and the Doctor and the Indian Colonel, not to speak\r\nof old Mr Western, were disposed to grant the request of the Curate; and\r\nwhen even Mr Proctor forsook his side, the Rector himself yielded.\r\n"Though it is against my judgment," he said, "and I see no advantage to\r\nbe gained by it, the meeting had better be held in the Rectory, this\r\nevening at seven o\'clock."\r\n\r\n"Most of us dine at seven o\'clock," said Dr Marjoribanks.\r\n\r\n"This evening at eight o\'clock," said the Rector, severely. "I will\r\nrequest all the witnesses to be in attendance, and we must hope to\r\nfind Mr Wentworth\'s witness of sufficient importance to justify the\r\nchange. At eight o\'clock this evening, in my house, gentlemen," said\r\nthe Rector. He collected his notes and went outside, and began talking\r\nto his witnesses, while the others collected together round the table\r\nto consult over this new phase of the affair. The three Mr Wentworths\r\nwent out together, the father between his two tall sons. The Squire\'s\r\nstrength was much shaken, both in mind and body. When they were out of\r\nthe shadow of the church, he looked up in Frank\'s face.\r\n\r\n"I hope you consider me entitled to an immediate explanation," said Mr\r\nWentworth. "When I read that anonymous letter, it went a long way\r\ntowards breaking my heart, sir; I can tell you it did. Jack here too,\r\nand your brother making up his mind as he has done, Frank. I am not a\r\nman to complain. If it were all over with me to-morrow, I shouldn\'t be\r\nsorry, so far as I am concerned, if it weren\'t for the girls and the\r\nlittle children. But I always thought I could have sworn by Frank,"\r\nsaid the old man, mournfully. He was ever so much older since he had\r\nsaid these words before in the long lime avenue at Wentworth Hall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe little assembly which met in the vestry of Carlingford Church to\r\ninquire into the conduct of the Perpetual Curate, had so many different\r\ninterests in hands when it dispersed, and so much to do, that it is\r\ndifficult for the narrator of this history to decide which thread should\r\nbe taken up first. Of all the interlocutors, however, perhaps Mr Proctor\r\nwas the one who had least succeeded in his efforts to explain himself,\r\nand accordingly demands in the first place the attention of an impartial\r\nhistorian. The excellent man was still labouring under much perplexity\r\nwhen the bed of justice was broken up. He began to recollect that Mr\r\nWentworth\'s explanation on the previous night had convinced him of his\r\ninnocence, and to see that it was indeed altogether inconceivable that\r\nthe Curate should be guilty; but then, other matters still more\r\ndisagreeable to contemplate than Mr Wentworth\'s guilt came in to darken\r\nthe picture. This vagabond Wodehouse, whom the Curate had taken in at\r\nhis sister\'s request--what was the meaning of that mystery? Mr Proctor\r\nhad never been anyhow connected with mysteries; he was himself an only\r\nson, and had lived a straightforward peaceable life. Neither he nor his\r\nestimable parents, so far as the late Rector was aware, had ever done\r\nanything to be ashamed of; and he winced a little at the thought of\r\nconnecting himself with concealment and secrecy. And then the Curate\'s\r\nsudden disappearance on the previous evening perplexed and troubled him.\r\nHe imagined all kinds of reasons for it as he walked down Grange Lane.\r\nPerhaps Miss Wodehouse, who would not receive himself, had sent for Mr\r\nWentworth; perhaps the vagabond brother was in some other scrape, out of\r\nwhich he had to be extricated by the Curate\'s assistance. Mr Proctor was\r\nperfectly honest, and indeed determined, in his "intentions;" but\r\neverybody will allow that for a middle-aged lover of fifty or\r\nthereabouts, contemplating a sensible match with a lady of suitable\r\nyears and means, to find suddenly that the object of his affections was\r\nnot only a penniless woman, but the natural guardian of an equally\r\npenniless sister, was startling, to say the least of it. He was a true\r\nman, and it did not occur to him to decline the responsibility\r\naltogether; on the contrary, he was perhaps more eager than he would\r\nhave been otherwise, seeing that his elderly love had far more need of\r\nhis devotion than he had ever expected her to have; but, notwithstanding,\r\nhe was disturbed by such an unlooked-for change of circumstances, as was\r\nnatural, and did not quite know what was to be done with Lucy. He was\r\nfull of thoughts on this subject as he proceeded towards the house, to\r\nthe interview which, to use sentimental language, was to decide his\r\nfate. But, to tell the truth, Mr Proctor was not in a state of very deep\r\nanxiety about his fate. The idea of being refused was too unreasonable\r\nan idea to gain much ground in his mind. He was going to offer his\r\npersonal support, affection, and sympathy to Miss Wodehouse at the least\r\nfortunate moment in her life; and if there was anything consolatory in\r\nmarriage at all, the late Rector sensibly concluded that it must be\r\ndoubly comforting under such circumstances, and that the offer of an\r\nhonest man\'s hand and house and income was not a likely thing to be\r\nrejected by a woman of Miss Wodehouse\'s experience and good sense--not\r\nto speak of his heart, which was very honest and true and affectionate,\r\nthough it had outlived the fervours of youth. Such was Mr Proctor\'s view\r\nof the matter; and the chances were strong that Miss Wodehouse entirely\r\nagreed with him--so, but for a certain shyness which made him rather\r\nnervous, it would not be correct to say that the late Rector was in a\r\nstate of special anxiety about the answer he was likely to receive. He\r\nwas, however, anxious about Lucy. His bachelor mind was familiar with\r\nall the ordinary traditions about the inexpediency of being surrounded\r\nby a wife\'s family; and he had a little of the primitive male sentiment,\r\nshared one way or other by most husbands, that the old system of buying\r\na woman right out, and carrying her off for his own sole and private\r\nsatisfaction, was, after all, the correct way of managing such matters.\r\nTo be sure, a pretty, young, unmarried sister, was perhaps the least\r\nobjectionable encumbrance a woman could have; but, notwithstanding, Mr\r\nProctor would have been glad could he have seen any feasible way of\r\ndisposing of Lucy. It was utterly out of the question to think of her\r\ngoing out as a governess; and it was quite evident that Mr Wentworth,\r\neven were he perfectly cleared of every imputation, having himself\r\nnothing to live upon, could scarcely offer to share his poverty with\r\npoor Mr Wodehouse\'s cherished pet and darling. "I daresay she has been\r\nused to live expensively," Mr Proctor said to himself, wincing a little\r\nin his own mind at the thought. It was about one o\'clock when he\r\nreached the green door--an hour at which, during the few months of\r\nhis incumbency at Carlingford, he had often presented himself at that\r\nhospitable house. Poor Mr Wodehouse! Mr Proctor could not help wondering\r\nat that moment how he was getting on in a world where, according to\r\nordinary ideas, there are no lunch nor dinner parties, no old port nor\r\nsavoury side-dishes. Somehow it was impossible to realise Mr Wodehouse\r\nwith other surroundings than those of good-living and creature-comfort.\r\nMr Proctor sighed, half for the departed, half at thought of the\r\nstrangeness of that unknown life for which he himself did not feel much\r\nmore fitted than Mr Wodehouse. In the garden he saw the new heir sulkily\r\nmarching about among the flower-beds smoking, and looking almost as much\r\nout of place in the sweet tranquillity of the English garden, as a\r\nchurchwarden of Carlingford or a Fellow of All-Souls could look, to\r\ncarry out Mr Proctor\'s previous imagination, in the vague beatitude of a\r\ndisembodied heaven. Wodehouse was so sick of his own company that he\r\ncame hastily forward at the sight of a visitor, but shrank a little when\r\nhe saw who it was.\r\n\r\n"I suppose you have brought some news," he said, in his sullen way. "I\r\nsuppose he has been making his statements, has he? Much I care! He may\r\ntell what lies he pleases; he can\'t do me any harm. I never did\r\nanything but sign my own name, by Jove! Jack Wentworth himself says\r\nso. I don\'t care _that_ for the parson and his threats," said\r\nWodehouse, snapping his fingers in Mr Proctor\'s face. The late Rector\r\ndrew back a little, with a shudder of disgust and resentment. He could\r\nnot help thinking that this fellow would most likely be his\r\nbrother-in-law presently, and the horror he felt made itself visible\r\nin his face.\r\n\r\n"I am quite unaware what you can mean," said Mr Proctor. "I am a\r\nparson, but I never made any threats that I know of. I wish to see\r\nMiss Wodehouse. I--I think she expects me at this hour," he said, with\r\na little embarrassment, turning to John, who, for his part, had been\r\nstanding by in a way which became his position as a respectable and\r\nfaithful servant, waiting any opportunity that might come handy to\r\nshow his disgust for the new _r\xe9gime_.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir," said John, promptly, and with emphasis. "My mistress\r\nexpects you, sir. She\'s come down to the drawing-room for the first\r\ntime. Miss Lucy keeps her room, sir, still; she\'s dreadfully cut up,\r\npoor dear young lady. My mistress will be glad to see you, sir," said\r\nJohn. This repetition of a title which Miss Wodehouse had not been in\r\nthe habit of receiving was intended for the special advantage of the\r\nnew master, whom John had no intention of recognising in that\r\ncapacity. "If you should know of any one, sir, as is in want of a\r\nsteady servant," the man continued, as he led the way into the house,\r\nwith a shrewd glance at Mr Proctor, whose "intentions" were legible\r\nenough to John\'s experienced eyes--"not as I\'m afeared of getting\r\nsuited, being well known in Carlingford; but it would come natural to\r\nbe with a friend of the family. There aint a servant in the house,\r\nsir, as will stay when the ladies go, and I think as Miss Wodehouse\r\nwould speak for me," said John, with natural astuteness. This address\r\nmade Mr Proctor a little uneasy. It recalled to him the unpleasant\r\nside of the important transaction in which he was about to engage. He\r\nwas not rich, and did not see his way now to any near prospect of\r\nrequiring the services of "a steady servant," and the thought made him\r\nsigh.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll see," he said, with a troubled look. To persevere honourably in\r\nhis "intentions" was one thing, but to be insensible to the loss of much\r\nhe had looked forward to was quite another. It was accordingly with a\r\ngrave and somewhat disturbed expression that he went to the interview\r\nwhich was "to decide his fate." Miss Wodehouse was seated in the\r\ndrawing-room, looking slightly flushed and excited. Though she knew it\r\nwas very wrong to be thus roused into a new interest the day after her\r\nfather\'s funeral, the events altogether had been of so startling a\r\ndescription that the usual decorum of an afflicted household had already\r\nbeen ruthlessly broken. And on the whole, notwithstanding her watching\r\nand grief, Mr Proctor thought he had never seen the object of his\r\naffections looking so well as she did now in the long black dress, which\r\nsuited her better than the faint dove colours in which she arrayed\r\nherself by preference. She was not, it is true, quite sure what Mr\r\nProctor wanted in this interview he had solicited, but a certain\r\nfeminine instinct instructed her in its probable eventualities. So she\r\nsat in a subdued flutter, with a little colour fluctuating on her cheek,\r\na tear in her eyes, and some wonder and expectation in her heart.\r\nPerhaps in her youth Miss Wodehouse might have come to such a feminine\r\ncrisis before; but if so, it was long ago, and the gentle woman had\r\nnever been given to matrimonial speculations, and was as fresh and\r\ninexperienced as any girl. The black frame in which she was set made her\r\nsoft colour look fresher and less faded. Her plaintive voice, the\r\ngeneral softness of her demeanour, looked harmonious and suitable to her\r\ncircumstances. Mr Proctor, who had by no means fallen in love with her\r\non account of any remnants of beauty she might possess, had never\r\nadmired her so much as he did now; he felt confused, good man, as he\r\nstood before her, and, seeing her so much younger and fairer than his\r\nformer idea, began to grow alarmed, and wonder at his serenity. What if\r\nshe thought him an old fogey? what if she refused him? This supposition\r\nbrought a crimson colour to Mr Proctor\'s middle-aged countenance, and\r\nwas far from restoring his courage. It was a wonderful relief to him\r\nwhen she, with the instinct of a timid woman, rushed into hasty talk.\r\n\r\n"It was very kind of you to come yesterday," she said; "Lucy and I\r\nwere very grateful. We have not many relatives, and my dear father--"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said the late Rector, again embarrassed by the tears which\r\nchoked her voice, "he was very much respected: that must be a\r\nconsolation to you. And he had a long life--and--and I suppose, on the\r\nwhole, a happy one," said Mr Proctor, "with you and your sister--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr Proctor, he had a great deal to put up with," said Miss\r\nWentworth, through her tears. She had, like most simple people, an\r\ninstinctive disinclination to admit that anybody was or had been\r\nhappy. It looked like an admission of inferiority. "Mamma\'s death, and\r\npoor Tom," said the elder sister. As she wiped her eyes, she almost\r\nforgot her own little feminine flutter of expectancy in respect to Mr\r\nProctor himself. Perhaps it was not going to happen this time, and as\r\nshe was pretty well assured that it would happen one day or another,\r\nshe was not anxious about it. "If I only knew what to do about Tom,"\r\nshe continued, with a vague appeal in her voice.\r\n\r\nMr Proctor got up from his chair and walked to the window. When he\r\nhad looked out he came back, rather surprising Miss Wodehouse by\r\nhis unlooked-for movements. "I wanted very much to have a little\r\nconversation with you," he said, growing again very red. "I daresay you\r\nwill be surprised--but I have accepted another living, Miss Wodehouse;"\r\nand here the good man stopped short in a terrible state of\r\nembarrassment, not knowing what next to say.\r\n\r\n"Yes?" said Miss Wodehouse, interrogatively. Her heart began to beat\r\nquicker, but perhaps he was only going to tell her about the new work\r\nhe had undertaken; and then she was a woman, and had some knowledge,\r\nwhich came by nature, how to conduct herself on an occasion such as\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know whether you recollect," said Mr Proctor--"I shall never\r\nforget it--one time when we all met in a house where a woman was\r\ndying,--I mean your sister and young Wentworth, and you and I;--and\r\nneither you nor I knew anything about it," said the late Rector, in a\r\nstrange voice. It was not a complimentary way of opening his subject,\r\nand the occurrence had not made so strong an impression upon Miss\r\nWodehouse as upon her companion. She looked a little puzzled, and, as\r\nhe made a pause, gave only a murmur of something like assent, and\r\nwaited to hear what more he might have to say.\r\n\r\n"We neither of us knew anything about it," said Mr Proctor--"neither\r\nyou how to manage her, nor I what to say to her, though the young\r\npeople did. I have always thought of you from that time. I have\r\nthought I should like to try whether I was good for anything now--if\r\nyou would help me," said the middle-aged lover. When he had said this\r\nhe walked to the window, and once more looked out, and came back\r\nredder than ever. "You see we are neither of us young," said Mr\r\nProctor; and he stood by the table turning over the books nervously,\r\nwithout looking at her, which was certainly an odd commencement for a\r\nwooing.\r\n\r\n"That is quite true," said Miss Wodehouse, rather primly. She had\r\nnever disputed that fact by word or deed, but still it was not\r\npleasant to have the statement thus thrust upon her without any\r\napparent provocation. It was not the sort of thing which a woman\r\nexpects to have said to her under such circumstances. "I am sure I\r\nhope you will do better--I mean be more comfortable--this time," she\r\ncontinued, after a pause, sitting very erect on her seat.\r\n\r\n"If you will help me," said Mr Proctor, taking up one of the books and\r\nreading the name on it, which was lucky for him, for it was Miss\r\nWodehouse\'s name, which he either had forgotten or never had known.\r\n\r\nAnd here they came to a dead stop. What was she to say? She was a\r\nlittle affronted, to tell the truth, that he should remember more\r\ndistinctly than anything else her age, and her unlucky failure on that\r\none occasion. "You have just said that I could not manage," said the\r\nmild woman, not without a little vigour of her own; "and how then\r\ncould I help you, Mr Proctor? Lucy knows a great deal more about\r\nparish work than I do," she went on in a lower tone; and for one half\r\nof a second there arose in the mind of the elder sister a kind of\r\nwistful half envy of Lucy, who _was_ young, and knew how to manage--a\r\nfeeling which died in unspeakable remorse and compunction as soon as\r\nit had birth.\r\n\r\n"But Lucy would not have me," said the late Rector; "and indeed I should\r\nnot know what to do with her if she would have me;--but you--It is a\r\nsmall parish, but it\'s not a bad living. I should do all I could to make\r\nyou comfortable. At least we might try," said Mr Proctor, in his most\r\ninsinuating tone. "Don\'t you think we might try? at least it would do--"\r\nHe was going to say "no harm," but on second thoughts rejected that\r\nexpression. "At least I should be very glad if you would," said the\r\nexcellent man, with renewed confusion. "It\'s a nice little rectory, with\r\na pretty garden, and all that sort of thing; and--and perhaps--it might\r\nhelp you to settle about going away--and--and I daresay there would be\r\nroom for Lucy. Don\'t you think you would try?" cried Mr Proctor,\r\nvolunteering, in spite of himself, the very hospitality which he had\r\nthought it hard might be required of him; but somehow his suit seemed to\r\nwant backing at the actual moment when it was being made.\r\n\r\nAs for Miss Wodehouse, she sat and listened to him till he began to\r\nfalter, and then her composure gave way all at once. "But as for\r\ntrying," she gasped, in broken mouthfuls of speech, "that would\r\nnever--never do, Mr Proctor. It has to be done--done for good and\r\nall--if--if it is done at all," sobbed the poor lady, whose voice came\r\nsomewhat muffled through her handkerchief and her tears.\r\n\r\n"Then it shall be for good and all!" cried Mr Proctor, with a sudden\r\nimpulse of energy. This was how it came about that Miss Wodehouse and\r\nthe late Rector were engaged. He had an idea that he might be expected\r\nto kiss her, and certainly ought to call her Mary after this; and\r\nhovered for another minute near her seat, not at all disinclined for\r\nthe former operation. But his courage failed him, and he only drew a\r\nchair a little closer and sat down, hoping she would soon stop crying.\r\nAnd indeed, by the time that he produced out of his pocket-book the\r\nlittle photograph of the new rectory, which he had had made for her by\r\na rural artist, Miss Wodehouse had emerged out of her handkerchief,\r\nand was perhaps in her heart as happy in a quiet way as she had ever\r\nbeen in her life. She who had never been good for much, was now, in\r\nthe time of their need, endowed with a home which she could offer\r\nLucy. It was she, the helpless one of the family, who was to be her\r\nyoung sister\'s deliverer. Let it be forgiven to her if, in the tumult\r\nof the moment, this was the thought that came first.\r\n\r\nWhen Miss Wodehouse went up-stairs after this agitating but\r\nsatisfactory interview, she found Lucy engaged in putting together\r\nsome books and personal trifles of her own which were scattered about\r\nthe little sitting-room. She had been reading \'In Memoriam\' until it\r\nvexed her to feel how inevitably good sense came in and interfered\r\nwith the enthusiasm of her grief, making her sensible that to apply to\r\nher fond old father all the lofty lauds which were appropriate to the\r\npoet\'s hero would be folly indeed. He had been a good tender father to\r\nher, but he was not "the sweetest soul that ever looked with human\r\neyes;" and Lucy could not but stop in her reading with a kind of pang\r\nand self-reproach as this consciousness came upon her. Miss Wodehouse\r\nlooked rather aghast when she found her sister thus occupied. "Did you\r\nthink of accepting Miss Wentworth\'s invitation, after all?" said Miss\r\nWodehouse; "but, dear, I am afraid it would be awkward; and oh, Lucy,\r\nmy darling, I have so many things to tell you," said the anxious\r\nsister, who was shy of communicating her own particular news. Before\r\nmany minutes had passed, Lucy had thrown aside all the books, and was\r\nsitting by her sister\'s side in half-pleased, disconcerted amazement\r\nto hear her story. Only half-pleased--for Lucy, like most other girls\r\nof her age, thought love and marriage were things which belonged only\r\nto her own level of existence, and was a little vexed and disappointed\r\nto find that her elder sister could condescend to such youthful\r\nmatters. On the whole, she rather blushed for Mary, and felt sadly as\r\nif she had come down from an imaginary pedestal. And then Mr Proctor,\r\nso old and so ordinary, whom it was impossible to think of as a\r\nbridegroom, and still less as a brother. "I shall get used to it\r\npresently," said Lucy, with a burning flush on her cheek, and a half\r\nfeeling that she had reason to be ashamed; "but it is so strange to\r\nthink of you in that way, Mary. I always thought you were too--too\r\nsensible for that sort of thing," which was a reproach that went to\r\nMiss Wodehouse\'s heart.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Lucy, dear," said that mild woman, who in this view of the matter\r\nbecame as much ashamed of herself as Lucy could desire, "what could I\r\ndo? I know what you mean, at my time of life; but I could not let you\r\nbe dependent on Tom, my darling," said Miss Wodehouse, with a\r\ndeprecating appealing look.\r\n\r\n"No indeed," said Lucy; "that would be impossible under any\r\ncircumstances: nor on you either, Mary dear. I can do something to\r\nmake a living, and I should like it. I have always been fond of work.\r\nI will not permit you to sacrifice yourself for me," said the younger\r\nsister, with some dignity. "I see how it has been. I felt sure it was\r\nnot of your own accord."\r\n\r\nMiss Wodehouse wrung her hands with dismay and perplexity. What was\r\nshe to do if Lucy stood out and refused her consent? She could not\r\nhumble herself so far as to confess that she rather liked Mr Proctor,\r\nand was, on the whole, not displeased to be married; for the feeling\r\nthat Lucy expected her to be too sensible for that sort of thing\r\noverawed the poor lady. "But, Lucy, I have given him my promise," said\r\npoor Miss Wodehouse. "It--it would make him very unhappy. I can\'t use\r\nhim badly, Lucy dear."\r\n\r\n"I will speak to him, and explain if it is necessary. Whatever\r\nhappens, I can\'t let you sacrifice yourself for me," said Lucy. All\r\nthe answer Miss Wodehouse could make was expressed in the tears of\r\nvexation and mortification which rushed to her eyes. She repelled her\r\nyoung sister\'s ministrations for the first time in her life with hasty\r\nimpatience. Her troubles had not been few for the last twenty-four\r\nhours. She had been questioned about Tom till she had altogether lost\r\nher head, and scarcely knew what she was saying; and Lucy had not\r\napplauded that notable expedient of throwing the shame of the family\r\nupon Mr Wentworth, to be concealed and taken care of, which had\r\nbrought so many vexations to the Perpetual Curate. Miss Wodehouse at\r\nlast was driven to bay. She had done all for the best, but nobody gave\r\nher any credit for it; and now this last step, by which she had meant\r\nto provide a home for Lucy, was about to be contradicted and put a\r\nstop to altogether. She put away Lucy\'s arm, and rejected her\r\nconsolations. "What is the use of pretending to be fond of me if I am\r\nalways to be wrong, and never to have my--my own way in anything?"\r\ncried the poor lady, who, beginning with steadiness, broke down before\r\nshe reached the end of her little speech. The words made Lucy open her\r\nblue eyes with wonder; and after that there followed a fuller\r\nexplanation, which greatly changed the ideas of the younger sister.\r\nAfter her "consent" had been at last extracted from her, and when Miss\r\nWodehouse regained her composure, she reported to Lucy the greater\r\npart of the conversation which had taken place in the drawing-room, of\r\nwhich Mr Proctor\'s proposal constituted only a part, and which touched\r\nupon matters still more interesting to her hearer. The two sisters,\r\npreoccupied by their father\'s illness and death, had up to this time\r\nbut a vague knowledge of the difficulties which surrounded the\r\nPerpetual Curate. His trial, which Mr Proctor had reported to his\r\nnewly-betrothed, had been unsuspected by either of them; and they were\r\nnot even aware of the event which had given rise to it--the\r\ndisappearance of Rosa Elsworthy. Miss Wodehouse told the story with\r\nfaltering lips, not being able to divest herself of the idea that,\r\nhaving been publicly accused, Mr Wentworth must be more or less\r\nguilty; while, at the same time, a sense that her brother must have\r\nhad something to do with it, and a great reluctance to name his name,\r\ncomplicated the narrative. She had already got into trouble with Lucy\r\nabout this unlucky brother, and unconsciously, in her story, she took\r\nan air of defence. "I should have thought better of Mr Wentworth if he\r\nhad not tried to throw the guilt on another," said the perplexed\r\nwoman. "Oh, Lucy dear, between two people it is so hard to know what\r\nto do."\r\n\r\n"I know what I shall do," said Lucy, promptly; but she would not\r\nfurther explain herself. She was, however, quite roused up out of \'In\r\nMemoriam.\' She went to her desk and drew out some of the paper deeply\r\nedged with black, which announced before words its tale of grief to\r\nall her correspondents. It was with some alarm that Miss Wodehouse\r\nawaited this letter, which was placed before her as soon as finished.\r\nThis was what, as soon as she knew the story, Lucy\'s prompt and\r\ngenerous spirit said:--\r\n\r\n\r\n "DEAR MR WENTWORTH,--We have just heard of the vexations you have been\r\n suffering, to our great indignation and distress. Some people may\r\n think it is a matter with which I have no business to interfere; but I\r\n cannot have you think for a moment, that we, to whom you have been so\r\n kind, could put the slightest faith in any such accusations against\r\n you. We are not of much consequence, but we are two women, to whom any\r\n such evil would be a horror. If it is any one connected with us who\r\n has brought you into this painful position, it gives us the more\r\n reason to be indignant and angry. I know now what you meant about the\r\n will. If it was to do over again, I should do just the same; but for\r\n all that, I understand now what you meant. I understand, also, how\r\n much we owe to you, of which, up to yesterday, I was totally unaware.\r\n You ought never to have been asked to take our burden upon your\r\n shoulders. I suppose you ought not to have done it; but all the same,\r\n thank you with all my heart. I don\'t suppose we ever can do anything\r\n for you to show our gratitude; and indeed I do not believe in paying\r\n back. But in the mean time, thank you--and don\'t, from any\r\n consideration for us, suffer a stain which belongs to another to rest\r\n upon yourself. You are a clergyman, and your reputation must be clear.\r\n Pardon me for saying so, as if I were qualified to advise you; but it\r\n would be terrible to think that you were suffering such an injury out\r\n of consideration for us.--Gratefully and truly yours,\r\n\r\n "LUCY WODEHOUSE."\r\n\r\n\r\nThe conclusion of this letter gave Lucy a good deal of trouble. Her\r\nhonest heart was so moved with gratitude and admiration that she had\r\nnearly called herself "affectionately" Mr Wentworth\'s. Why should not\r\nshe? "He has acted like a brother to us," Lucy said to herself; and\r\nthen she paused to inquire whether his conduct had indeed arisen from\r\nbrotherly motives solely. Then, when she had begun to write\r\n"faithfully" instead, a further difficulty occurred to her. Not thus\r\nlightly and unsolicited could she call herself "faithful," for did not\r\nthe word mean everything that words could convey in any human\r\nrelationship? When she had concluded it at last, and satisfied her\r\nscruples by the formula above, she laid the letter before her sister.\r\nThis event terminated the active operations of the day in the dwelling\r\nof the Wodehouses. Their brother had not asked to see them, had not\r\ninterrupted them as yet in their retreat up-stairs, where they were\r\nsedulously waited upon by the entire household. When Miss Wodehouse\'s\r\nagitation was over, she too began to collect together her books and\r\npersonalities, and they ended by a long consultation where they were\r\nto go and what they were to do, during the course of which the elder\r\nsister exhibited with a certain shy pride that little photograph of\r\nthe new rectory, in which there was one window embowered in foliage,\r\nwhich the bride had already concluded was to be Lucy\'s room. Lucy\r\nyielded during this sisterly conference to sympathetic thoughts even\r\nof Mr Proctor. The two women were alone in the world. They were still\r\nso near the grave and the deathbed that chance words spoken without\r\nthought from time to time awakened in both the ready tears. Now and\r\nthen they each paused to consider with a sob what _he_ would have\r\nliked best. They knew very little of what was going on outside at the\r\nmoment when they were occupied with those simple calculations. What\r\nwas to become of them, as people say--what money they were to have, or\r\nmeans of living--neither was much occupied in thinking of. They had\r\neach other; they had, besides, one a novel and timid middle-aged\r\nconfidence, the other an illimitable youthful faith in one man in the\r\nworld. Even Lucy, whose mind and thoughts were more individual than\r\nher sister\'s, wanted little else at that moment to make her happy with\r\na tender tremulous consolation in the midst of her grief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile matters were thus arranging themselves in the ideas at least of\r\nthe two sisters whose prospects had been so suddenly changed,\r\nexplanations of a very varied kind were going on in the house of the\r\nMiss Wentworths. It was a very full house by this time, having been\r\ninvaded and taken possession of by the "family" in a way which entirely\r\nobliterated the calmer interests and occupations of the habitual\r\ninhabitants. The three ladies had reached the stage of life which knows\r\nno personal events except those of illness and death; and the presence\r\nof Jack Wentworth, of Frank and Gerald, and even of Louisa, reduced them\r\naltogether to the rank of spectators, the audience, or at the utmost the\r\nchorus, of the drama; though this was scarcely the case with Miss Dora,\r\nwho kept her own room, where she lay on the sofa, and received visits,\r\nand told the story of her extraordinary adventure, the only adventure of\r\nher life. The interest of the household centred chiefly, however, in the\r\ndining-room, which, as being the least habitable apartment in the house,\r\nwas considered to be most adapted for anything in the shape of business.\r\nOn the way from the church to Miss Wentworth\'s house the Curate had\r\ngiven his father a brief account of all the events which had led to his\r\npresent position; but though much eased in his mind, and partly\r\nsatisfied, the Squire was not yet clear how it all came about. His\r\ncountenance was far from having regained that composure, which indeed\r\nthe recent course of events in the family had pretty nearly driven out\r\nof his life. His fresh light-coloured morning dress, with all its little\r\nniceties, and the fresh colour which even anxiety could not drive away\r\nfrom his cheeks, were somehow contradicted in their sentiment of\r\ncheerfulness by the puckers in his forehead and the harassed look of his\r\nface. He sat down in the big leathern chair by the fireplace, and looked\r\nround him with a sigh, and the air of a man who wonders what will be the\r\nnext vexation. "I\'d like to hear it over again, Frank," said the Squire.\r\n"My mind is not what it used to be; I don\'t say I ever was clever, like\r\nyou young fellows, but I used to understand what was said to me. Now I\r\nseem to require to hear everything twice over; perhaps it is because I\r\nhave had myself to say the same things over again a great many times\r\nlately," he added, with a sigh of weariness. Most likely his eye fell on\r\nGerald as he said so; at all events, the Rector of Wentworth moved sadly\r\nfrom where he was standing and went to the window, where he was out of\r\nhis father\'s range of vision. Gerald\'s looks, his movements, every\r\naction of his, seemed somehow to bear a symbolic meaning at this crisis\r\nin his life. He was no longer in any doubt; he had made up his mind. He\r\nlooked like a martyr walking to his execution, as he crossed the room;\r\nand the Squire looked after him, and once more breathed out of his\r\nimpatient breast a heavy short sigh. Louisa, who had placed herself in\r\nthe other great chair at the other side of the forlorn fireplace, from\r\nwhich, this summer afternoon, there came no cheerful light, put up her\r\nhandkerchief to her eyes and began to cry with half-audible sobs--which\r\ncircumstances surrounding him were far from being encouraging to Frank\r\nas he entered anew into his own story--a story which he told with many\r\ninterruptions. The Squire, who had once "sworn by Frank," had now a\r\nterrible shadow of distrust in his mind. Jack was here on the spot, of\r\nwhom the unfortunate father knew more harm than he had ever told, and\r\nthe secret dread that he had somehow corrupted his younger brother came\r\nlike a cold shadow over Mr Wentworth\'s mind. He could not slur over any\r\npart of the narrative, but cross-examined his son to the extent of his\r\nability, with an anxious inquisition into all the particulars. He was\r\ntoo deeply concerned to take anything for granted. He sat up in his\r\nchair with those puckers in his forehead, with that harassed look in his\r\neyes, making an anxious, vigilant, suspicious investigation, which was\r\npathetic to behold. If the defendant, who was thus being examined on his\r\nhonour, had been guilty, the heart of the judge would have broken; but\r\nthat was all the more reason for searching into it with jealous\r\nparticularity, and with a suspicion which kept always gleaming out of\r\nhis troubled eyes in sudden anxious glances, saying, "You are guilty?\r\nAre you guilty?" with mingled accusations and appeals. The accused,\r\nbeing innocent, felt this suspicion more hard to bear than if he had\r\nbeen a hundred times guilty.\r\n\r\n"I understand a little about this fellow Wodehouse," said the Squire;\r\n"but what I want to know is, why you took him in? What did you take\r\nhim in for, sir, at first? Perhaps I could understand the rest if you\r\nwould satisfy me of that."\r\n\r\n"I took him in," said the Curate, rather slowly, "because his sister\r\nasked me. She threw him upon my charity--she told me the danger he was\r\nin--"\r\n\r\n"What danger was he in?" asked the Squire.\r\n\r\nThe Curate made a pause, and as he paused Mr Wentworth leaned forward\r\nin his chair, with another pucker in his forehead and a still sharper\r\ngleam of suspicion in his eyes. "His father had been offended time\r\nafter time in the most serious way. This time he had threatened to\r\ngive him up to justice. I can\'t tell you what he had done, because it\r\nwould be breaking my trust--but he had made himself obnoxious to the\r\nlaw," said Frank Wentworth. "To save him from the chance of being\r\narrested, his sister brought him to me."\r\n\r\nThe Squire\'s hand shook a good deal as he took out his handkerchief\r\nand wiped his forehead. "Perhaps it would be the best way if one had\r\nnot too much regard for the honour of the family," he said,\r\ntremulously, like a man under a sudden temptation; "but the sister,\r\nsir, why did she bring him to you?" he added, immediately after, with\r\nrenewed energy. Mr Wentworth was not aware that, while he was\r\nspeaking, his eldest son had come into the room. He had his back to\r\nthe door, and he did not see Jack, who stood rather doubtfully on the\r\nthreshold, with a certain shade of embarrassment upon his ordinary\r\ncomposure. "It is not everybody that a woman would confide her\r\nbrother\'s life to," said the Squire. "Who is the sister? Is she--is\r\nthere any--any entanglement that I don\'t know of? It will be better\r\nfor all of us if you tell me plainly," said the old man, with a\r\nquerulous sound in his voice. He forgot the relationship of his own\r\ngirls to Jack, and groaned within himself at what appeared almost\r\ncertain evidence that the sister of a criminal like Wodehouse had got\r\npossession of Frank.\r\n\r\n"Miss Wodehouse is about the same age as my aunt Dora," said the\r\nCurate. It was an exaggeration which would have gone to the poor\r\nlady\'s heart, but Frank Wentworth, in the unconscious insolence of his\r\nyouth, was quite unaware and careless of the difference. Then he\r\npaused for a moment with an involuntary smile. "But I am a clergyman,\r\nsir," he continued, seriously. "If a man in my position is good for\r\nanything, it is his business to help the helpless. I could do no good\r\nin any other way--I took him into my house."\r\n\r\n"Frank," said the Squire, "I beg your pardon. I believe in my heart\r\nyou\'re true and honest. If I were not driven out of my senses by one\r\nthing and another," said Mr Wentworth, with bitterness. "They make me\r\nunjust to you, sir--unjust to you! But never mind; go on. Why didn\'t\r\nyou tell these fellows what you\'ve told me? That would have settled\r\nthe business at once, without any more ado."\r\n\r\n"Mr Morgan is a great deal too much prejudiced against me to believe\r\nanything I said. I thought it better to let him prove to himself his\r\nown injustice; and another still more powerful reason--" said the\r\nCurate.\r\n\r\n"Stop, sir, stop; I can\'t follow you to more than one thing at a time.\r\nWhy is Mr Morgan prejudiced against you?" said the Squire, once more\r\nsitting upright and recommencing his examination.\r\n\r\nFrank Wentworth laughed in spite of himself, though he was far from\r\nbeing amused. "I know no reason, except that I have worked in his\r\nparish without his permission," he answered, briefly enough, "for\r\nwhich he threatened to have me up before somebody or other--Dr\r\nLushington, I suppose, who is the new Council of Trent, and settles\r\nall our matters for us nowadays," said the Curate, not without a\r\nlittle natural scorn, at which, however, his father groaned.\r\n\r\n"There is nothing to laugh at in Dr Lushington," said the Squire. "He\r\ngives you justice, at all events, which you parsons never give each\r\nother, you know. You ought not to have worked in the Rector\'s parish,\r\nsir, without his permission. It\'s like shooting in another man\'s\r\ngrounds. However, that\'s not my business;--and the other reason, sir?"\r\nsaid Mr Wentworth, with his anxious look.\r\n\r\n"My dear father," said the Curate, touched by the anxiety in the\r\nSquire\'s face, and sitting down by him with a sudden impulse, "I have\r\ndone nothing which either you or I need be ashamed of. I am grieved\r\nthat you should think it necessary to examine me so closely. Wodehouse\r\nis a rascal, but I had taken charge of him; and as long as it was\r\npossible to shield him, I felt bound to do so. I made an appeal to his\r\nhonour, if he had any, and to his fears, which are more to be depended\r\non, and gave him until noon to-day to consider it. Here is his note,\r\nwhich was given me in the vestry; and now you know the whole business,\r\nand how it is that I postponed the conclusion till to-night."\r\n\r\nThe Squire put on his spectacles with a tremulous hand to read the note\r\nwhich his son gave him. The room was very still while he read it, no\r\nsound interrupting him except an occasional sniff from Louisa, who was\r\nin a permanent state of whimpering, and, besides, had ceased to be\r\ninterested in Frank\'s affairs. Jack Wentworth, standing in the\r\nbackground behind the Squire\'s chair, had the whole party before him,\r\nand studied them keenly with thoughts which nobody guessed at. Gerald\r\nwas still standing by the window, leaning on it with his face only half\r\nturned to the others. Was he thinking of the others? was he still one of\r\nthem? or was he saying his office from some invisible breviary\r\nabstracted into another life? That supposition looked the most like\r\ntruth. Near him was his wife, who had thrown herself, a heap of bright\r\nfluttering muslin, into the great chair, and kept her handkerchief to\r\nher red eyes. She had enough troubles of her own to occupy her, poor\r\nsoul! Just at that moment it occurred to her to think of the laburnum\r\nberries in the shrubbery at the Rectory, which, it was suddenly borne in\r\nupon her, would prove fatal to one or other of the children in her\r\nabsence;--the dear Rectory which she had to leave so soon! "And Frank\r\nwill have it, of course," Louisa said to herself, "and marry somebody;"\r\nand then she thought of the laburnum berries in connection with his\r\nproblematical children, not without a movement of satisfaction. Opposite\r\nto her was the Squire, holding Wodehouse\'s epistle in a hand which shook\r\na little, and reading aloud slowly as he could make it out. The note was\r\nshort and insolent enough. While it was being read, Jack Wentworth, who\r\nwas not easily discomposed, grew red and restless. He had not dictated\r\nit certainly, nor even suggested the wording of the epistle; but it was\r\nhe who, half in scorn and half in pity of the vagabond\'s terrors, had\r\nreassured Wodehouse, and convinced him that it was only the punishments\r\nof public opinion which the Curate could bring upon him. Hardened as\r\nJack was, he could not but be conscious that thus to stand in his\r\nbrother\'s way was a shabby business enough, and to feel that he himself\r\nand his prot\xe9g\xe9 cut a very poor figure in presence of the manful old\r\nSquire with all his burdens, and of Frank, who had, after all, nothing\r\nto explain which was not to his honour. Notwithstanding that he was at\r\nthe present moment his brother\'s adversary, actually working against him\r\nand prolonging his difficulties, an odd kind of contempt and indignation\r\nagainst the fools who could doubt Frank\'s honour possessed the prodigal\r\nat the moment. "A parcel of asses," he said to himself; and so stood and\r\nlistened to Wodehouse\'s little note of defiance, which, but for his\r\nprompting, the sullen vagabond would never have dared to send to his\r\nformer protector. The letter itself was as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n "I have consulted my friends about what you said to-day, and they tell\r\n me it is d----d nonsense. You can\'t do me any harm; and I don\'t mean\r\n to get myself into any scrape for you. You can do what you like--I\r\n shan\'t take any notice. Your love affairs are no business of\r\n mine.--Yours truly,\r\n\r\n "T. WODEHOUSE"\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Wentworth threw the miserable scrawl on the table. "The fellow is a\r\nscoundrel," said the Squire; "he does not seem to have a spark of\r\ngratitude. You\'ve done a deal too much for him already; and if the\r\nsister is as old as Dora--" he continued, after a long pause, with a\r\nhalf-humorous relaxation of his features. He was too much worn out to\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said the Curate. The young man was sensible of a sudden flush\r\nand heat, but did not feel any inclination to smile. Matters were very\r\nserious just then with Frank Wentworth. He was about to shake himself\r\nfree of one vexation, no doubt; but at this moment, when Lucy\r\nWodehouse was homeless and helpless, he had nothing to offer her, nor\r\nany prospects even which he dared ask her to share with him. This was\r\nno time to speak of the other sister, who was not as old as Miss Dora.\r\nHe was more than ever the Perpetual Curate now. Perhaps, being a\r\nclergyman, he ought not to have been swayed by such merely human\r\nemotions; but honour and pride alike demanded that he should remain in\r\nCarlingford, and he had no shelter to offer Lucy in the time of her\r\nneed.\r\n\r\nAfter this there followed a pause, which was far from being cheerful.\r\nFrank could not but be disconsolate enough over his prospects when the\r\nexcitement died away; and there was another big, terrible event\r\nlooming darkly in the midst of the family, which they had not courage\r\nto name to each other. The long, uneasy pause was at length broken by\r\nLouisa, whose voice sounded in the unnatural silence like the burst of\r\nimpatient rain which precedes a thunderstorm.\r\n\r\n"Now that you have done with Frank\'s affairs, if you have done with\r\nthem," said Louisa, "perhaps somebody will speak to Gerald. I don\'t\r\nmean in the way of arguing. If some one would only speak _sense_ to\r\nhim. You all know as well as I do how many children we\'ve got,\r\nand--and--an--other coming," sobbed the poor lady, "if something\r\ndoesn\'t happen to me, which I am sure is more than likely, and might\r\nbe expected. I don\'t blame dear grandpapa, for he has said everything,\r\nand so have I; but I do think his brothers ought to take a little more\r\ninterest. Oh, Frank, you know it doesn\'t matter for you. You are a\r\nyoung man, you can go anywhere; but when there are five children\r\nand--and--an--other--And how are we to live? You know what a little\r\nbit of money I had when Gerald married me. Everybody knows Gerald\r\nnever cared for money. If I had had a good fortune it would have been\r\nquite different," cried poor Louisa, with a little flow of tears and a\r\nquerulous sob, as though that too was Gerald\'s fault. "He has not sent\r\noff his letter yet, Frank," said the injured wife; "if you would but\r\nspeak to him. He does not mind me or grandpapa, but he might mind you.\r\nTell him we shall have nothing to live on; tell him--"\r\n\r\n"Hush," said Gerald. He came forward to the table, very pale and\r\npatient, as became a man at the point of legal death. "I _have_ sent\r\naway my letter. By this time I am no longer Rector of Wentworth. Do\r\nnot break my heart. Do you think there is any particular in the whole\r\nmatter which I have not considered--the children, yourself,\r\neverything? Hush; there is nothing now to be said."\r\n\r\nThe Squire rose, almost as pale as his son, from his chair. "I think\r\nI\'ll go out into the air a little," said Mr Wentworth. "There\'s always\r\nsomething new happening. Here is a son of my own," said the old man,\r\nrising into a flush of energy, "who has not only deserted his post,\r\nbut deserted it secretly, Frank. God bless my soul! don\'t speak to me,\r\nsir; I tell you he\'s gone over to the enemy as much as Charley would\r\nhave done if he had deserted at the Alma--and done it when nobody knew\r\nor was thinking. I used to be thought a man of honour in my day," said\r\nMr Wentworth, bitterly; "and it\'s a mean thing to say it came by their\r\nmother\'s side. There\'s Jack--"\r\n\r\nThe eldest son roused himself up at the mention of his own name.\r\nNotwithstanding all his faults, he was not a man to stand behind backs\r\nand listen to what was said of him. He came forward with his usual\r\nease, though a close observer might have detected a flush on his face.\r\n"I am here, sir," said the heir. "I cannot flatter myself you will\r\nhave much pleasure in seeing me; but I suppose I have still a right to\r\nbe considered one of the family." The Squire, who had risen to his\r\nfeet, and was standing leaning against the table when Jack advanced,\r\nreturned to his chair and sat down as his eldest son confronted him.\r\nThey had not met for years, and the shock was great. Mr Wentworth put\r\nhis hand to his cravat and pulled at it with an instinctive movement.\r\nThe old man was still feeble from his late illness, and apprehensive\r\nof a return of the disease of the Wentworths. He restrained himself,\r\nhowever, with force so passionate that Jack did not guess at the\r\nmeaning of the gasp which, before the Squire was able to speak to him,\r\nconvulsed his throat, and made Frank start forward to offer assistance\r\nwhich his father impatiently rejected. The Squire made, indeed, a\r\ngreat effort to speak with dignity. He looked from one to another of\r\nhis tall sons as he propped himself up by the arms of his chair.\r\n\r\n"You are the most important member of the family," said Mr Wentworth;\r\n"it is long since you have been among us, but that is not our fault.\r\nIf things had been different, I should have been glad of your advice\r\nas a man of the world. Anyhow, I can\'t wish you to be estranged from\r\nyour brothers," said the Squire. It was all any one could say. The\r\nheir of Wentworth was not to be denounced or insulted among his\r\nkindred, but he could not be taken to their bosom. Perhaps the\r\nreception thus given him was more galling than any other could have\r\nbeen to Jack Wentworth\'s pride. He stood at the table by himself\r\nbefore his father, feeling that there existed no living relations\r\nbetween himself and any one present. He had keen intellectual\r\nperceptions, and could recognise the beauty of honour and worth as\r\nwell as most people; and the contrast between himself and the others\r\nwho surrounded him presented itself in a very forcible light to Jack.\r\nInstead of Gerald and Frank, Wodehouse was _his_ allotted companion.\r\nFor that once he was bitter, notwithstanding his habitual good-humour.\r\n\r\n"Yes," he said; "it would be a pity to estrange me from my brothers.\r\nWe are, on the whole, a lucky trio. I, whom my relations are civil to;\r\nand Frank, who is not acquitted yet, though he seems so confident; and\r\nGerald, who has made the greatest mistake of all--"\r\n\r\n"Jack," said the Curate, "nobody wants to quarrel with you. You\'ve\r\ndealt shabbily by me, but I do not mind. Only talk of things you\r\nunderstand--don\'t talk of Gerald."\r\n\r\nFor a moment Jack Wentworth was roused almost to passion. "What is\r\nGerald that I should not understand him?" said Jack; "he and I are the\r\noriginal brood. You are all a set of interlopers, the rest of you.\r\nWhat is Gerald that I should not talk of him? In the world, my dear\r\nFrank," continued the heir, superciliously, "as the Squire himself\r\nwill testify, a man is not generally exempted from criticism because\r\nhe is a parson. Gerald is--"\r\n\r\n"I am a simple Catholic layman, nothing more," said Gerald; "not worth\r\ncriticism, having done nothing. I am aware I am as good as dead. There\r\nis no reason why Jack should not talk if it pleases him. It will make\r\nno difference to me."\r\n\r\n"And yet," said Frank, "it is only the other day that you told us you\r\nwere nothing if not a priest."\r\n\r\nGerald turned upon him with a look of melancholy reproach that went to\r\nthe Curate\'s heart. "It is true I said so," he replied, and then he\r\nmade a pause, and the light died out of his pale face. "Don\'t bring up\r\nthe ghosts of my dead battles, Frank. I said so only the other day.\r\nBut it is the glory of the true Church," said the convert, with a\r\nsudden glow which restored colour for a moment to his face, "to\r\nrestrain and subdue the last enemy, the will of man. I am content to\r\nbe nothing, as the saints were. The fight has been hard enough, but I\r\nam not ashamed of the victory. When the law of the Church and the\r\nobedience of the saints ordain me to be nothing, I consent to it.\r\nThere is nothing more to say."\r\n\r\n"And this is how it is to be!" cried Louisa. "He knows what is coming,\r\nand he does not care--and none of you will interfere or speak to him!\r\nIt is not as if he did not know what would happen. He tells you\r\nhimself that he will be nothing; and even if _he_ can put up with it\r\nafter being a man of such consideration in the county, how am _I_ to\r\nput up with it? We have always been used to the very best society,"\r\nsaid poor Louisa, with tears. "The Duke himself was not more thought\r\nof; and now he tells you he is to be nothing!" Mrs Wentworth stopped\r\nto dry her eyes with tremulous haste. "_He_ may not mind," said\r\nLouisa, "for at least he is having his own way. It is all very well\r\nfor a man, who can do as he pleases; but it is his poor wife who will\r\nhave to suffer. I don\'t know who will visit me after it\'s all over,\r\nand people will give over asking us if we don\'t ask them again; and\r\nhow can we ever have anybody, with five children--or more--and only a\r\nfew hundreds a-year? Oh, Frank, it kills me to think of it. Don\'t you\r\nthink you might speak to him again?" she whispered, stretching up to\r\nhis ear, when Gerald, with a sigh, had gone back to his window. The\r\nSquire, too, cast an appealing glance at his younger son.\r\n\r\n"It is all true enough that she says," said Mr Wentworth. "She mayn\'t\r\nunderstand _him_, Frank, but she\'s right enough in what she\'s saying.\r\nIf things were different between your brother and me, I\'d ask his\r\nadvice," said the Squire, with a sigh. He gave a longing look at his\r\neldest son, who stood with his usual ease before the fireplace.\r\nMatters had gone a great deal too far between the father and son to\r\nadmit of the usual displeasure of an aggrieved parent--all that was\r\nover long ago; and Mr Wentworth could not restrain a certain melting\r\nof the heart towards his first-born. "He\'s not what I could wish, but\r\nhe\'s a man of the world, and might give us some practical advice,"\r\nsaid the Squire, with his anxious looks. Of what possible advantage\r\nadvice, practical or otherwise, could have been in the circumstances,\r\nit was difficult to see; but the Squire was a man of simple mind, and\r\nstill believed in the suggestions of wisdom. He still sat in the\r\neasy-chair, looking wistfully at Jack, and with a certain faith that\r\nmatters might even yet be mended, if the counsel of his eldest son, as\r\na man of the world, could be had and could be trusted; when Frank, who\r\nhad an afternoon service at Wharfside, had to leave the family\r\ncommittee. Gerald, who roused up when his younger brother mentioned\r\nthe business he was going upon, looked at Frank almost as wistfully as\r\nhis father looked at Jack. "It may be the last time," he said to\r\nhimself; "if you\'ll let me, I\'ll go with you, Frank;" and so the\r\nlittle conclave was broken up. The people in Prickett\'s Lane were\r\ngreatly impressed by the aspect of Gerald Wentworth, as he went,\r\nsilent and pale, by his brother\'s side, down the crowded pavement.\r\nThey thought it must be a bishop at least who accompanied the Curate\r\nof St Roque\'s; and the women gathered at a little distance and made\r\ntheir comments, as he stood waiting for his brother after the service.\r\n"He don\'t look weakly nor sickly no more nor the clergyman," said one;\r\n"but he smiles at the little uns for all the world like my man smiled\r\nthe night he was took away." "Smilin\' or not smilin\'," said another,\r\n"I don\'t see as it makes no matter; but I\'d give a deal to know what\r\nElsworthy and them as stands by Elsworthy can say after that." "Maybe,\r\nthen, he\'d give the poor fatherless children a blessing afore he\'d\r\ngo," suggested a poor Irish widow, who, having been much under Mr\r\nWentworth\'s hands "in her trouble," was not quite sure now what faith\r\nshe professed, or at least which Church she belonged to. Such was the\r\nuniversal sentiment of Prickett\'s Lane. Meanwhile Gerald stood silent,\r\nand looked with pathetic, speechless eyes at the little crowd. He was\r\nno priest now--he was shorn of the profession which had been his life.\r\nHis hope of being able to resign all things for Christ\'s sake had\r\nfailed him. Too wary and politic to maintain in a critical age and\r\ncountry the old licence of the ages of Faith, even his wife\'s consent,\r\ncould he have obtained it, would not have opened to the convert the\r\nway into the priesthood. A greater trial had been required of him; he\r\nwas nothing, a man whose career was over. He stood idly, in a kind of\r\nlanguor, looking on while the Curate performed the duties of his\r\noffice--feeling like a man whom sickness had reduced to the last stage\r\nof life, and for whom no earthly business remained; while, at the same\r\ntime, his aspect struck awe, as that of a bishop at the least, to the\r\nimagination of Prickett\'s Lane.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Morgan did not go home direct from the investigation of the morning;\r\non the contrary, he paid various visits, and got through a considerable\r\namount of parish business, before he turned his face towards the\r\nRectory. On the whole, his feelings were far from being comfortable. He\r\ndid not know, certainly, who Mr Wentworth\'s witness was, but he had an\r\nunpleasant conviction that it was somebody who would clear the Curate.\r\n"Of course I shall be very glad," the Rector said to himself; but it is\r\na fact, that in reality he was far from being glad, and that a secret\r\nconviction of this sentiment, stealing into his mind, made matters still\r\nmore uncomfortable. This private sense of wishing evil to another man,\r\nof being unwilling and vexed to think well of his neighbour, was in\r\nitself enough to disturb the Rector\'s tranquillity; and when to this was\r\nadded the aggravation that his wife had always been on the other side,\r\nand had warned him against proceeding, and might, if she pleased, say,\r\n"I told you so," it will be apparent that Mr Morgan\'s uneasiness was not\r\nwithout foundation. Instead of going home direct to acquaint his wife\r\nwith the circumstances, about which he knew she must be curious, it was\r\nlate in the afternoon before the Rector opened his own gate. Even then\r\nhe went through the garden with a reluctant step, feeling it still more\r\ndifficult to meet her now than it would have been at first, although his\r\ndelay had arisen from the thought that it would be easier to encounter\r\nher keen looks after an interval. There was, however, no keen look to be\r\ndreaded at this moment. Mrs Morgan was busy with her ferns, and she did\r\nnot look up as her husband approached. She went on with her occupation,\r\nexamining carefully what withered fronds there might be about her\r\nfavourite maidenhair, even when he stopped by her side. Though her\r\nhusband\'s shadow fell across the plants she was tending, Mrs Morgan, for\r\nthe first time in her married life, did not look up to welcome the\r\nRector. She made no demonstration, said no word of displeasure, but only\r\nshowed herself utterly absorbed in, and devoted to, her ferns. There\r\nwas, to be sure, no such lover of ferns in the neighbourhood of\r\nCarlingford as the Rector\'s wife.\r\n\r\nAs for Mr Morgan, he stood by her side in a state of great discomfort\r\nand discomfiture. The good man\'s perceptions were not very clear, but\r\nhe saw that she had heard from some one the issue of the morning\'s\r\ninquiry, and that she was deeply offended by his delay, and that, in\r\nshort, they had arrived at a serious difference, the first quarrel\r\nsince their marriage. Feeling himself in the wrong, Mr Morgan\r\nnaturally grew angry too.\r\n\r\n"I should like to have dinner earlier to-day," he said, with the usual\r\nindiscretion of an aggrieved husband. "Perhaps you will tell the cook,\r\nmy dear. I think I should like to have it at five, if possible. It\r\ncan\'t make much difference for one day."\r\n\r\nMrs Morgan raised herself up from her ferns, and no doubt it was a\r\nrelief to her to find herself provided with so just a cause of\r\ndispleasure. "Much difference!" cried the Rector\'s wife; "it is\r\nhalf-past four now. I wonder how you could think of such a thing,\r\nWilliam. There is some lamb, which of course is not put down to roast\r\nyet, and the ducks. If you wish the cook to give warning immediately,\r\nyou may send such a message. It is just like a man to think it would\r\nmake no difference! But I must say, to do them justice," said the\r\nRector\'s wife, "it is not like a man of your college!" When she had\r\nfired this double arrow, she took off her gardening gloves and lifted\r\nher basket. "I suppose you told Mr Proctor that you wished to dine\r\nearly?" said Mrs Morgan, with severity, pausing on the threshold. "Of\r\ncourse it is quite impossible to have dinner at five unless he knows."\r\n\r\n"Indeed I--I forgot all about Proctor," said the Rector, who now saw\r\nthe inexpediency of his proposal. "On second thoughts, I see it does\r\nnot matter much. But after dinner I expect some people about Mr\r\nWentworth\'s business. It was not settled this morning, as I expected."\r\n\r\n"So I heard," said Mrs Morgan. "I will tell Thomas to show them into\r\nthe library," and she went indoors, carrying her basket. As for the\r\nRector, he stood silent, looking after her, and feeling wonderfully\r\ndiscomfited. Had she found fault with him for his delay--had she even\r\nsaid "I told you so!" it would have been less overwhelming than this\r\nindifference. They had never had a quarrel before, and the effect was\r\nproportionately increased. After standing bewildered at the door for a\r\nfew minutes, he retired into his study, where the change in his wife\'s\r\ndemeanour haunted him, and obscured Mr Wentworth. Mrs Morgan sat at\r\nthe head of the table at dinner with an equal want of curiosity. Even\r\nwhen the subject was discussed between the Rector and Mr Proctor, she\r\nasked no questions--a course of procedure very puzzling and trying to\r\nMr Morgan, who could not make it out.\r\n\r\nIt was after eight o\'clock before the tribunal of the morning was\r\nreconstituted at the Rectory. Most of the gentlemen came late, and the\r\nlittle assembly brought with it a flavour of port, which modified the\r\nserious atmosphere. When the bed of justice was again formed, Mr\r\nWentworth entered with the bodyguard of Wentworths, which numbered\r\nhalf as many as his judges. Half from curiosity, half from a reluctant\r\ninclination to please his father, Jack had joined the others, and they\r\ncame in together, all of them noticeable men, profoundly different,\r\nyet identified as belonging to each other by the touching bond of\r\nfamily resemblance. After the four gentlemen had taken possession of\r\ntheir corner, Mr Waters made a somewhat hurried entry, bringing after\r\nhim the sullen reluctant figure of Wodehouse, who made an awkward bow\r\nto the assembled potentates, and looked ashamed and vigilant, and very\r\nill at ease. Mr Waters made a hasty explanation to the Rector before\r\nhe sat down by the side of his unlucky client. "I thought it possible\r\nthere might be some attempt made to shift the blame upon him,\r\ntherefore I thought it best to bring him," said the lawyer. Mr Morgan\r\ngave him a dry little nod without answering. To tell the truth, the\r\nRector felt anything but comfortable; when he glanced up at the\r\nstranger, who was looking askance at the people in the room as if they\r\nhad been so many policemen in disguise, a disagreeable sudden\r\nconviction that this sullen rascal looked a great deal more like the\r\nguilty man than Mr Wentworth did, came into Mr Morgan\'s mind, and made\r\nhim sick with annoyance and embarrassment. If it should turn out so!\r\nif it should become apparent that he, for private prejudices of his\r\nown, had been persecuting his brother! This thought produced an actual\r\nphysical effect for the moment upon the Rector, but its immediate\r\nvisible consequence was simply to make him look more severe, almost\r\nspiteful, in a kind of unconscious self-vindication. Last of all,\r\nElsworthy, who began to be frightened too, but whose fears were\r\nmingled with no compunction nor blame of himself, stole in and found\r\nan uncomfortable seat on a stool near the door, where scarcely any one\r\nsaw him, by favour of Thomas, and screened by the high back of the\r\nRector\'s easy-chair. When all were assembled Mr Morgan spoke.\r\n\r\n"We are met this evening, gentlemen, to complete, if there is sufficient\r\ntime, the investigation we began this morning," said the Rector. "I have\r\nno doubt I express the sentiments of every one present when I say I\r\nshall be glad--_unfeignedly_ glad," said Mr Morgan, with a defiant\r\nemphasis, which was meant to convince himself, "to find that Mr\r\nWentworth\'s witness is of sufficient importance to justify the delay. As\r\nwe were interrupted this morning solely on his account, I presume it\r\nwill be most satisfactory that this witness should be called at once."\r\n\r\n"I should like to say something in the first place," said the Curate.\r\nMr Morgan made an abrupt nod indicative of his consent, and, instead\r\nof looking at the defendant, shaded his eyes with his hand, and made\r\nfigures with his pen upon the blotting-paper. A conviction, against\r\nwhich it was impossible to strive, had taken possession of the\r\nRector\'s soul. He listened to Frank Wentworth\'s address with a kind of\r\nimpatient annoyance and resistance. "What is the good of saying any\r\nmore about it?" Mr Morgan was saying in his soul. "For heaven\'s sake\r\nlet us bury it and be done with it, and forget that we ever made such\r\nasses of ourselves." But at the same time the Rector knew this was\r\nquite impossible; and as he sat leaning over his blotting-book,\r\nwriting down millions after millions with his unconscious pen, he\r\nlooked a very model of an unwilling listener--a prejudiced judge--a\r\nman whom no arguments could convince; which was the aspect under which\r\nhe appeared to the Curate of St Roque\'s.\r\n\r\n"I should like to say something first," said the Perpetual Curate. "I\r\ncould not believe it possible that I, being tolerably well known in\r\nCarlingford as I have always supposed, could be suspected by any\r\nrational being of such an insane piece of wickedness as has been laid\r\nto my charge; and consequently it did not occur to me to vindicate\r\nmyself, as I perhaps ought to have done, at the beginning. I have been\r\ncareless all along of vindicating myself. I had an idea," said the\r\nyoung man, with involuntary disdain, "that I might trust, if not to\r\nthe regard, at least to the common-sense of my friends--"\r\n\r\nHere John Brown, who was near his unwary client, plucked at the\r\nCurate\'s coat, and brought him to a momentary half-angry pause.\r\n"Softly, softly," said Dr Marjoribanks; "common-sense has nothing to\r\ndo with facts; we\'re inquiring into facts at this moment; and,\r\nbesides, it\'s a very foolish and unjustifiable confidence to trust to\r\nany man\'s common-sense," said the old Doctor, with a humorous glance\r\nfrom under his shaggy eyebrows at his fellow-judges; upon which there\r\nensued a laugh, not very agreeable in its tone, which brought the\r\nRector to a white heat of impatience and secret rage.\r\n\r\n"It appears to me that the witness ought to be called at once," said\r\nMr Morgan, "if this is not a mere expedient to gain time, and if it is\r\nintended to make any progress to-night."\r\n\r\n"My explanations shall be very brief," said Frank Wentworth, facing\r\ninstantly to his natural enemy. "I have suspected from the beginning\r\nof this business who was the culprit, and have made every possible\r\nattempt to induce him to confess, and, so far as he could, amend the\r\nwrong that he had done. I have failed; and now the confession, the\r\n_amende_, must be made in public. I will now call my witness," said\r\nthe Curate. But this time a commotion rose in another part of the\r\nroom. It was Wodehouse, who struggled to rise, and to get free from\r\nthe detaining grasp of his companion.\r\n\r\n"By Jove! I aint going to sit here and listen to a parcel of lies!"\r\ncried the vagabond. "If I am to be tried, at least I\'ll have the real\r\nthing, by Jove!" He had risen up, and was endeavouring to pass Mr\r\nWaters and get out, casting a suspicious defiant look round the room.\r\nThe noise he made turned all eyes upon him, and the scrutiny he had\r\nbrought upon himself redoubled his anxiety to get away. "I\'ll not\r\nstand it, by Jove! Waters, let me go," said the craven, whose confused\r\nimagination had mixed up all his evil doings together, and who already\r\nfelt himself being carried off to prison. It was at this moment that\r\nJack Wentworth rose from his place in his easy careless way, and went\r\nforward to the table to adjust the lamp, which was flaring a little.\r\nWodehouse dropped back into a chair as soon as he caught the eye of\r\nthis master of his fate. His big beard moved with a subterranean gasp\r\nlike the panting of a hunted creature, and all the colour that had\r\nremained died away out of his haggard, frightened face. As for Jack\r\nWentworth, he took no apparent notice of the shabby rascal whom he\r\nheld in awe. "Rather warm this room for a court of justice. I hope\r\nFrank\'s witness is not fat," said Jack, putting himself up against the\r\nwall, and lifting languidly his glass to his eye--which byplay was\r\nsomewhat startling, but totally incomprehensible, to the amateur\r\njudges, who looked upon him with angry eyes.\r\n\r\n"I must request that the proceedings may not be interrupted," said Mr\r\nMorgan; and then everybody looked towards the open door: the sight they\r\nsaw there was enough to startle the calmest spectator. Elsworthy, who\r\nwas seated close by, sprang from his stool with a low resounding howl of\r\namazement, upsetting his lowly seat, and staggering back against the\r\nwall, in the excess of his wonder and consternation. The judges\r\nthemselves forgot their decorum, and crowded round upon each other to\r\nstare--old Mr Western putting his arm round the Rector\'s neck in his\r\ncuriosity, as if they had been two boys at a peep-show. It was Miss\r\nLeonora Wentworth\'s erect iron-grey figure that appeared in the doorway,\r\nhalf leading in, half pushing before her, the unfortunate cause of all\r\nthe commotion--Rosa Elsworthy herself. A change had passed upon the\r\nlittle girl\'s rosy, dewy, April beauty. Her pretty dark eyes were\r\nenlarged and anxious, and full of tears; her cheeks had paled out of\r\ntheir sweet colour, her red lips were pressed tightly together. Passion\r\nand shame had set their marks upon the child\'s forehead--lightly, it is\r\ntrue, but still the traces were there; but beyond all other sentiments,\r\nanxiety, restless, breathless, palpitating, had possession of Mr\r\nWentworth\'s all-important witness. It was very clear that, whatever\r\nmight be the opinion of her judges, Rosa\'s case was anything but\r\nhopeless in her own eyes. She came in drooping, shrinking, and abashed,\r\nas was natural; but her shame was secondary in Rosa\'s mind, even in the\r\nmoment of her humiliation. She came to a dead stop when she had made a\r\nfew steps into the room, and cast furtive glances at the dread\r\ntribunal, and began to cry. She was trembling with nervous eagerness,\r\nwith petulance and impatience. Almost all her judges, except the Rector\r\nand Mr Proctor, had been known to Rosa from her earliest years. She was\r\nnot afraid of them, nor cast down by any sense of overwhelming\r\ntransgression--on the contrary, she cast an appealing look round her,\r\nwhich implied that they could still set everything right if they would\r\nexert themselves; and then she began to cry.\r\n\r\n"Gentlemen, before you ask any questions," said Miss Leonora\r\nWentworth, "I should like to explain why I am here. I came not because\r\nI approve of _her_, but because it is right that my nephew should have\r\na respectable woman to take charge of the witness. She was brought to\r\nmy house last night, and has been in my charge ever since;--and I come\r\nwith her now, not because I approve of her, but because she ought to\r\nbe in charge of some woman," said Miss Leonora, sitting down abruptly\r\nin the chair some one had placed for her. The chair was placed close\r\nby the spot where Rosa stood crying. Poor, pretty, forsaken child!\r\nPerhaps Miss Leonora, who sat beside her, and occupied the position of\r\nher protector, was of all the people present the only one who had not\r\nalready forgiven Rosa, the only one who would have still been disposed\r\nto punish her, and did not pardon the weeping creature in her heart.\r\n\r\n"Now that you\'re here, Rosa," said Dr Marjoribanks, "the only sensible\r\nthing you can do is to dry your eyes and answer the questions that\r\nhave to be put to you. Nobody will harm you if you speak the truth.\r\nDon\'t be frightened, but dry your eyes, and let us hear what you have\r\nto say."\r\n\r\n"Poor little thing," said old Mr Western; "of course she has done very\r\nwrong. I don\'t mean to defend her--but, after all, she is but a child.\r\nPoor little thing! Her mother died, you know, when she was a baby. She\r\nhad nobody to tell her how to behave.--I don\'t mean to defend her, for\r\nshe has done very wrong, poor little--"\r\n\r\n"We are falling into mere conversation," said the Rector, severely.\r\n"Rosa Elsworthy, come to the table. The only thing you can do to make\r\nup for all the misery you have caused to your friends, is to tell the\r\ntruth about everything. You are aged--how much? eighteen years?"\r\n\r\n"Please, sir, only seventeen," said Rosa; "and oh, please, sir, I\r\ndidn\'t mean no harm. I wouldn\'t never have gone, no, not a step, if he\r\nhadn\'t a-promised that we was to be married. Oh, please, sir--"\r\n\r\n"Softly a little," said John Brown, interfering. "It is not you who\r\nare on your trial, Rosa. We are not going to question you about your\r\nfoolishness; all that the Rector wants you to tell him is the name of\r\nthe man who persuaded you to go away."\r\n\r\nAt which question Rosa cried more and more. "I don\'t think he meant no\r\nharm either," cried the poor little girl. "Oh, if somebody would\r\nplease speak to him! We couldn\'t be married then, but now if anybody\r\nwould take a little trouble! I told him Mr Wentworth would, if I was\r\nto ask him; but then I thought perhaps as Mr Wentworth mightn\'t like\r\nto be the one as married me," said Rosa, with a momentary gleam of\r\nvanity through her tears. The little simper with which the girl spoke,\r\nthe coquettish looks askance at the Perpetual Curate, who stood grave\r\nand unmoved at a distance, the movement of unconscious self-deception\r\nand girlish vanity which for a moment distracted Rosa, had a great\r\neffect upon the spectators. The judges looked at each other across the\r\ntable, and Dr Marjoribanks made a commentary of meditative nods upon\r\nthat little exhibition. "Just so," said the Doctor; "maybe Mr\r\nWentworth might have objected. If you tell me the man\'s name, _I_\'ll\r\nspeak to him, Rosa," said the old Scotsman, grimly. As for the Rector,\r\nhe had put down his pen altogether, and looked very much as if he were\r\nthe culprit. Certainly his shame and confusion and self-disgust were\r\ngreater than that of any one else in the room.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Doctor, please don\'t be angry. Oh, if somebody would only speak\r\nto him!" cried poor Rosa. "Oh, please, it wasn\'t my fault--I haven\'t\r\ngot no--nobody to speak for me!" At this moment she got a glimpse of\r\nher uncle\'s face, dark and angry, looming behind the Rector\'s chair.\r\nRosa shrank back with a frightened movement, and caught fast hold of\r\nMiss Leonora\'s dress. "Oh, please, don\'t let him kill me!" cried the\r\nterrified girl. She sank down at Miss Wentworth\'s feet, and held\r\ntightly by her unwilling protectress. She was a frightened child,\r\nafraid of being whipped and punished; she was not an outraged woman,\r\nforsaken and miserable. Nobody knew what to do with her as she\r\ncrouched down, panting with fright and anxiety, by Miss Leonora\'s\r\nside.\r\n\r\n"We must know who this man is," said John Brown. "Look here, Rosa; if\r\nanybody is to do you good, it is necessary to know the man. Rise up\r\nand look round, and tell me if you can see him here."\r\n\r\nAfter a moment\'s interval Rosa obeyed. She stood up trembling, resting\r\nher hand to support herself on Miss Leonora\'s chair--almost, she\r\ntrembled so, on Miss Leonora\'s shoulder. Up to this moment the ignorant\r\nlittle creature had scarcely felt the shame of her position; she had\r\nfelt only the necessity of appealing to the kindness of people who knew\r\nher--people who were powerful enough to do very nearly what they pleased\r\nin Carlingford; for it was in this light that Rosa, who knew no better,\r\nregarded the Doctor and her other judges. This time her eye passed\r\nquickly over those protectors. The tears were still hanging on her\r\neyelashes; her childish bosom was still palpitating with sobs. Beyond\r\nthe little circle of light round the table, the room was comparatively\r\nin shadow. She stood by herself, her pretty face and anxious eyes\r\nappearing over Miss Wentworth\'s head, her fright and her anxiety both\r\nforgotten for the moment in the sudden hope of seeing her betrayer.\r\nThere was not a sound in the room to disturb the impartiality of her\r\nsearch. Every man kept still, as if by chance he might be the offender.\r\nRosa\'s eyes, bright with anxiety, with eagerness, with a feverish hope,\r\nwent searching into the shadow, gleaming harmless over the Wentworth\r\nbrothers, who were opposite. Then there was a start and a loud cry. She\r\nwas not ashamed to be led before the old men, who were sorry for her,\r\nand who could protect her; but now at last the instinct of her womanhood\r\nseized upon the unfortunate creature. She had made an involuntary rush\r\ntowards him when she saw him first. Then she stopped short, and looked\r\nall round her with a bewildered sudden consciousness. The blood rushed\r\nto her face, scorching and burning; she uttered a sudden cry of anguish\r\nand shame. "Oh, don\'t forsake me!--don\'t forsake me!--listen to the\r\ngentlemen!" cried poor Rosa, and fell down in a sudden agony of\r\nself-comprehension at Wodehouse\'s feet.\r\n\r\nFor a few minutes after there was nothing but confusion in the room.\r\nElsworthy had been standing behind backs, with a half-fiendish look of\r\nrage and disappointment on his commonplace features. "Let them help her\r\nas likes; I washes my hands of her," he cried bitterly, when he saw her\r\nfall; and then rushed into the midst of the room, thrusting the others\r\nout of his way. The man was beside himself with mortification, with\r\ndisgust, and fury, and at the same time with a savage natural affection\r\nfor the creature who had baffled and disgraced him, yet still was his\r\nown. "Let alone--let alone, I tell you! There\'s nobody as belongs to her\r\nbut me!" cried Elsworthy, pushing up against the Doctor, who had lifted\r\nher from the ground. As for Wodehouse, he was standing scowling down\r\nupon the pretty figure at his feet: not that the vagabond was utterly\r\nheartless, or could look at his victim without emotion; on the contrary,\r\nhe was pale with terror, thinking he had killed her, wondering in his\r\nmiserable heart if they would secure him at once, and furtively watching\r\nthe door to see if he had a chance of escape. When Mr Waters seized his\r\narm, Wodehouse gave a hoarse outcry of horror. "I\'ll marry her--oh,\r\nLord, I\'ll marry her! I never meant anything else," the wretched man\r\ncried, as he sank back again into his chair. He thought she was dead, as\r\nshe lay with her upturned face on the carpet, and in his terror and\r\nremorse and cowardice his heart seemed to stop beating. If he could have\r\nhad a chance of escaping, he would not have hesitated to dash the old\r\nDoctor out of his way, and rush over the body of the unhappy girl whom\r\nhe thought he had murdered. But Waters held him fast; and he sank back,\r\npanting and horrified, on his seat. "I never touched her; nobody can say\r\nI touched her," muttered the poor wretch to himself; and watched with\r\nfascinated eyes and the distinct apprehension of terror every movement\r\nand change of position, calculating how he might dart out when the\r\nwindow was opened--having forgotten for the moment that Jack Wentworth,\r\nas well as the companion who kept immediate watch over him, was in the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n"She\'ll come to herself presently," said Dr Marjoribanks. "We\'ll carry\r\nher up-stairs. Yes, I know you don\'t approve of her, Miss Wentworth;\r\nnobody said you were to approve of her. Not that I think she\'s a\r\nresponsible moral agent myself," said the Doctor, lifting her up in\r\nhis vigorous arms; "but in the mean time she has to be brought to\r\nlife. Keep out of my way, Elsworthy; you should have looked better\r\nafter the little fool. If she\'s not accountable for her actions, _you_\r\nare," he went on with a growl, thrusting away with his vigorous\r\nshoulder the badly-hung frame of Rosa\'s uncle, who was no match for\r\nthe Doctor. Thus the poor little girl was carried away in a kind of\r\nprocession, Miss Leonora going first. "Not that I think her worth all\r\nthis fuss, the vain little fool," said Miss Leonora; "she\'ll come to\r\nherself, no fear of her;" but, notwithstanding her protest, the\r\nstrong-minded woman led the way. When the room was cleared, the\r\ngentlemen who remained took their seats mechanically, and stared at\r\neach other. In the shame and confusion of the moment nobody could find\r\nanything to say, and the Curate was magnanimous, and did not take\r\nadvantage of his triumph. The silence was broken by the Rector, who\r\nrose up solemnly from his chair to speak. Probably no one in the room\r\nhad suffered so acutely as Mr Morgan; his face was crimson, his eyes\r\nsuffused and angry. Frank Wentworth rose involuntarily at the same\r\nmoment, expecting, he could not tell why, to be addressed, but sat\r\ndown again in a little confusion when he found that the Rector had\r\nturned his eyes in a totally different direction. Mr Morgan put the\r\nlamp out of the way, that he might be able to transfix with the full\r\nglow of his angry eyes the real offender, who sat only half conscious,\r\nabsorbed with his own terror, by the lawyer\'s side.\r\n\r\n"Sir!" said the Rector, in a tone which, severe as his voice was by\r\nnature, nobody had ever heard from his lips before, "you have put us\r\nall in a most ridiculous and painful position to-night. I don\'t know\r\nwhether you are capable of feeling the vileness of your own misconduct\r\nas regards the unhappy girl who has just been carried out of the room,\r\nbut you certainly shall not leave the house without hearing--"\r\n\r\nWodehouse gave such a start at these words that Mr Morgan paused a\r\nmoment. The Rector was quite unaware of the relief, the sense of\r\nsafety, which he had inadvertently conveyed to the mind of the shabby\r\nrascal whom he was addressing. He was then to be allowed to leave the\r\nhouse? "I\'ll leave the d----d place to-night, by Jove!" he muttered in\r\nhis beard, and immediately sat up upon his chair, and turned round\r\nwith a kind of sullen vivacity to listen to the remainder of Mr\r\nMorgan\'s speech.\r\n\r\n"You shall not leave this house," said the Rector, more peremptorily\r\nstill, "without hearing what must be the opinion of every gentleman,\r\nof every honest man. You have been the occasion of bringing an utterly\r\nunfounded accusation against a--a young clergyman," said Mr Morgan,\r\nwith a succession of gasps, "of--of the very highest character. You\r\nhave, as I understand, sir, abused his hospitality, and--and done your\r\nutmost to injure him when you owed him gratitude. Not content with\r\nthat, sir," continued the Rector, "you have kept your--your very\r\nexistence concealed, until the moment when you could injure your\r\nsisters. You may perhaps be able to make a miserable amends for the\r\nwrong you have done to the unfortunate girl up-stairs, but you can\r\nnever make amends to me, sir, for betraying me into a ridiculous\r\nposition, and leading me to do--an--an absurd and--and incredible\r\ninjustice--to a--to my--to Mr Frank Wentworth. Sir, you are a\r\nscoundrel!" cried Mr Morgan, breaking down abruptly in an access of\r\nsudden fury. When the Rector had recovered himself, he turned with\r\ngreat severity to the rest of the company: "Gentlemen, my wife will be\r\nglad to see you up-stairs," said Mr Morgan. The sound of this\r\nhospitable invitation was as if he had ordered the entire assembly to\r\nthe door; but nevertheless most of the company followed him as he\r\nrose, and, without condescending to look round again, marched out of\r\nthe library. The Squire rose with the rest, and took the hand of his\r\nson Frank and grasped it closely. Somehow, though he believed Frank\r\nbefore, Mr Wentworth was easier in his mind after the Rector\'s speech.\r\n\r\n"I think I will go up-stairs and shake hands with him," said the\r\nSquire, "and you had better come too, Frank. No doubt he will expect\r\nit. He spoke up very well at the last, and I entirely agree with the\r\nRector," he said, looking sternly, but with a little curiosity, at the\r\nvagabond, who stood recovering himself, and ready to resume his\r\nhopeless swagger. It was well for Mr Wentworth that he left the room\r\nat once, and went cheerfully up-stairs to pay his respects to Mrs\r\nMorgan. The Squire said, "Thank God!" quietly to himself when he got\r\nout of the library. "Things are mending, surely--even Jack--even\r\nJack," Mr Wentworth said, under his breath; and the simple gentleman\r\nsaid over a part of the general thanksgiving, as he went slowly, with\r\nan unusual gladness, up the stair. He might not have entered Mrs\r\nMorgan\'s drawing-room with such a relieved and brightened countenance\r\nhad he stayed ten minutes longer in the library, and listened to the\r\nfurther conversation there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL.\r\n\r\n\r\n"Now, Mr Wodehouse," said Jack Wentworth, "it appears that you and I\r\nhave a word to say to each other." They had all risen when the other\r\ngentlemen followed Mr Morgan out of the room, and those who remained\r\nstood in a group surrounding the unhappy culprit, and renewing his\r\nimpression of personal danger. When he heard himself thus addressed,\r\nhe backed against the wall, and instinctively took one of the chairs\r\nand placed it before him. His furtive eye sought the door and the\r\nwindow, investigating the chances of escape. When he saw that there\r\nwas none, he withdrew still a step further back, and stood at bay.\r\n\r\n"By Jove! I aint going to stand all this," said Wodehouse; "as if\r\nevery fellow had a right to bully me--it\'s more than flesh and blood\r\ncan put up with. I don\'t care for that old fogey that\'s gone\r\nup-stairs; but, by Jove! I won\'t stand any more from men that eat my\r\ndinners, and win my money, and--"\r\n\r\nJack Wentworth made half a step forward with a superb smile--"My good\r\nfellow, you should never reproach a man with his good actions," he said;\r\n"but at the same time, having eaten your dinners, as you describe, I\r\nhave a certain claim on your gratitude. We have had some--a--business\r\nconnection--for some years. I don\'t say you have reason to be actually\r\ngrateful for that; but, at least, it brought you now and then into the\r\nsociety of gentlemen. A man who robs a set of women, and leaves the poor\r\ncreature he has ruined destitute, is a sort of cur we have nothing to\r\nsay to," said the heir of the Wentworths, contemptuously. "We do not\r\npretend to be saints, but we are not blackguards; that is to say," said\r\nJack, with a perfectly calm and harmonious smile, "not in theory, nor in\r\nour own opinion. The fact accordingly is, my friend, that you must\r\nchoose between _us_ and those respectable meannesses of yours. By Jove!\r\nthe fellow ought to have been a shopkeeper, and as honest as--Diogenes,"\r\nsaid Jack. He stood looking at his wretched associate with the\r\noverwhelming impertinence of a perfectly well-bred man, no way\r\nconcealing the contemptuous inspection with which his cool eyes\r\ntravelled over the disconcerted figure from top to toe, seeing and\r\nexaggerating all its tremors and clumsy guiltiness. The chances are, had\r\nJack Wentworth been in Wodehouse\'s place, he would have been master of\r\nthe position as much as now. He was not shocked nor indignant like his\r\nbrothers. He was simply contemptuous, disdainful, not so much of the\r\nwickedness as of the clumsy and shabby fashion in which it had been\r\naccomplished. As for the offender, who had been defiant in his sulky\r\nfashion up to this moment, his courage oozed out at his finger-ends\r\nunder Jack Wentworth\'s eye.\r\n\r\n"I am my own master," he stammered, "nowadays. I aint to be dictated\r\nto--and I shan\'t be, by Jove! As for Jack Wentworth, he\'s well known\r\nto be neither more nor less--"\r\n\r\n"Than what, Mr Wodehouse?" said the serene and splendid Jack. "Don\'t\r\ninterest yourself on my account, Frank. This is my business at\r\npresent. If you have any prayer-meetings in hand, we can spare\r\nyou--and don\'t forget our respectable friend in your supplications.\r\nFavour us with your definition of Jack Wentworth, Mr Wodehouse. He is\r\nneither more nor less--?"\r\n\r\n"By Jove! I aint going to stand it," cried Wodehouse; "if a fellow\'s\r\nto be driven mad, and insulted, and have his money won from him, and\r\nmade game of--not to say tossed about as I\'ve been among \'em, and made\r\na drudge of, and set to do the dirty work," said the unfortunate\r\nsubordinate, with a touch of pathos in his hoarse voice;--"I don\'t\r\nmean to say I\'ve been what I ought; but, by Jove! to be put upon as\r\nI\'ve been, and knocked about; and at the last they haven\'t the pluck\r\nto stand by a fellow, by Jove!" muttered Mr Wodehouse\'s unlucky heir.\r\nWhat further exasperation his smiling superior intended to heap upon\r\nhim nobody could tell; for just as Jack Wentworth was about to speak,\r\nand just as Wodehouse had again faced towards him, half-cowed,\r\nhalf-resisting, Gerald, who had been looking on in silence, came\r\nforward out of the shadow. He had seen all and heard all, from that\r\nmoral deathbed of his, where no personal cares could again disturb\r\nhim; and though he had resigned his office, he could not belie his\r\nnature. He came in by instinct to cherish the dawn of compunction\r\nwhich appeared, as he thought, in the sinner\'s words.\r\n\r\n"The best thing that can happen to you," said Gerald, at the sound of\r\nwhose voice everybody started, "is to find out that the wages of sin are\r\nbitter. Don\'t expect any sympathy or consolation from those who have\r\nhelped you to do wrong. My brother tries to induce you to do a right act\r\nfrom an unworthy motive. He says your former associates will not\r\nacknowledge you. My advice to you is to forsake your former associates.\r\nMy brother," said Gerald, turning aside to look at him, "would do\r\nhimself honour if he forsook them also--but for you, here is your\r\nopportunity. You have no temptation of poverty now. Take the first step,\r\nand forsake them. I have no motive in advising you--except, indeed, that\r\nI am Jack Wentworth\'s brother. He and you are different," said Gerald,\r\ninvoluntarily glancing from one to the other. "And at present you have\r\nthe means of escape. Go now and leave them," said the man who was a\r\npriest by nature. The light returned to his eye while he spoke; he was\r\nno longer passive, contemplating his own moral death; his natural office\r\nhad come back to him unawares. He stretched his arm towards the door,\r\nthinking of nothing but the escape of the sinner. "Go," said Gerald.\r\n"Refuse their approbation; shun their society. For Christ\'s sake, and\r\nnot for theirs, make amends to those you have wronged. Jack, I command\r\nyou to let him go."\r\n\r\nJack, who had been startled at first, had recovered himself long\r\nbefore his brother ceased to speak. "Let him go, by all means," he\r\nsaid, and stood superbly indifferent by Gerald\'s side, whistling under\r\nhis breath a tripping lively air. "No occasion for solemnity. The\r\nsooner he goes the better," said Jack. "In short, I see no reason why\r\nany of us should stay, now the business is accomplished. I wonder\r\nwould his reverence ever forgive me if I lighted my cigar?" He took\r\nout his case as he spoke, and began to look over its contents. There\r\nwas one in the room, however, who was better acquainted with the\r\nindications of Jack Wentworth\'s face than either of his brothers. This\r\nunfortunate, who was hanging in an agony of uncertainty over the chair\r\nhe had placed before him, watched every movement of his leader\'s face\r\nwith the anxious gaze of a lover, hoping to see a little corresponding\r\nanxiety in it, but watched in vain. Wodehouse had been going through a\r\nfever of doubt and divided impulses. The shabby fellow was open to\r\ngood impressions, though he was not much in the way of practising\r\nthem; and Gerald\'s address, which, in the first place, filled him with\r\nawe, moved him afterwards with passing thrills of compunction, mingled\r\nwith a kind of delight at the idea of getting free. When his admonitor\r\nsaid "Go," Wodehouse made a step towards the door, and for an instant\r\nfelt the exhilaration of enfranchisement. But the next moment his eye\r\nsought Jack Wentworth\'s face, which was so superbly careless, so\r\nindifferent to him and his intentions, and the vagabond\'s soul\r\nsuccumbed with a canine fidelity to his master. Had Jack shown any\r\ninterest, any excitement in the matter, his sway might have been\r\ndoubtful; but in proportion to the sense of his own insignificance and\r\nunimportance Wodehouse\'s allegiance confirmed itself. He looked\r\nwistfully towards the hero of his imagination, as that skilful\r\npersonage selected his cigar. He would rather have been kicked again\r\nthan left alone, and left to himself. After all, it was very true what\r\nJack Wentworth said. They might be a bad lot, but they were gentlemen\r\n(according to Wodehouse\'s understanding of the word) with whom he had\r\nbeen associated; and beatific visions of peers and baronets and\r\nhonourables, amongst whom his own shabby person had figured, without\r\nfeeling much below the common level, crossed his mind with all the\r\nsweetness which belongs to a past state of affairs. Yet it was still\r\nin his power to recall these vanishing glories. Now that he was rich,\r\nand could "cut a figure" among the objects of his admiration, was that\r\nbrilliant world to be closed upon him for ever by his own obstinacy?\r\nAs these thoughts rushed through his mind, little Rosa\'s beauty and\r\nnatural grace came suddenly to his recollection. Nobody need know how\r\nhe had got his pretty wife, and a pretty wife she would be--a creature\r\nwhom nobody could help admiring. Wodehouse looked wistfully at Jack\r\nWentworth, who took no notice of him as he chose his cigar. Jack was\r\nnot only the ideal of the clumsy rogue, but he was the doorkeeper of\r\nthat paradise of disreputable nobles and ruined gentlemen which was\r\nWodehouse\'s idea of good society; and from all this was he about to be\r\nbanished? Jack Wentworth selected his cigar with as much care as if\r\nhis happiness depended on it, and took no notice of the stealthy\r\nglances thrown at him. "I\'ll get a light in the hall," said Jack;\r\n"good evening to you," and he was actually going away.\r\n\r\n"Look here," said Wodehouse, hastily, in his beard; "I aint a man to\r\nforsake old friends. If Jack Wentworth does not mean anything\r\nunreasonable, or against a fellow\'s honour--Hold your tongue, Waters;\r\nby Jove! I know my friends. I know you would never have been one of\r\nthem but for Jack Wentworth. He\'s not the common sort, I can tell you.\r\nHe\'s the greatest swell going, by Jove!" cried Jack\'s admiring\r\nfollower, "and through thick and thin he\'s stood by me. I aint going\r\nto forsake him now--that is, if he don\'t want anything that goes\r\nagainst a fellow\'s honour," said the repentant prodigal, again sinking\r\nthe voice which he had raised for a moment. As he spoke he looked more\r\nwistfully than ever towards his leader, who said "Pshaw!" with an\r\nimpatient gesture, and put back his cigar.\r\n\r\n"This room is too hot for anything," said Jack; "but don\'t open the\r\nwindow, I entreat of you. I hate to assist at the suicide of a set of\r\ninsane insects. For heaven\'s sake, Frank, mind what you\'re doing. As\r\nfor Mr Wodehouse\'s remark," said Jack, lightly, "I trust I never could\r\nsuggest anything which would wound his keen sense of honour. I advise\r\nyou to marry and settle, as I am in the habit of advising young men;\r\nand if I were to add that it would be seemly to make some provision\r\nfor your sisters--"\r\n\r\n"Stop there!" said the Curate, who had taken no part in the scene up\r\nto this moment. He had stood behind rather contemptuously, determined\r\nto have nothing to do with his ungrateful and ungenerous prot\xe9g\xe9. But\r\nnow an unreasonable impulse forced him into the discussion. "The less\r\nthat is said on that part of the subject the better," he said, with\r\nsome natural heat. "I object to the mixing up of names which--which no\r\none here has any right to bandy about--"\r\n\r\n"That is very true," said Mr Proctor; "but still they have their\r\nrights," the late Rector added after a pause. "We have no right to\r\nstand in the way of their--their interest, you know." It occurred to\r\nMr Proctor, indeed, that the suggestion was on the whole a sensible\r\none. "Even if they were to--to marry, you know, they might still be\r\nleft unprovided for," said the late Rector. "I think it is quite just\r\nthat some provision should be made for that."\r\n\r\nAnd then there was a pause. Frank Wentworth was sufficiently aware after\r\nhis first start of indignation that he had no right to interfere, as Mr\r\nProctor said, between the Miss Wodehouses and their interest. He had no\r\nmeans of providing for them, of setting them above the chances of\r\nfortune. He reflected bitterly that it was not in his power to offer a\r\nhome to Lucy, and through her to her sister. What he had to do was to\r\nstand by silently, to suffer other people to discuss what was to be done\r\nfor the woman whom he loved, and whose name was sacred to him. This was\r\na stretch of patience of which he was not capable. "I can only say\r\nagain," said the Curate, "that I think this discussion has gone far\r\nenough. Whatever matters of business there may be that require\r\narrangement had better be settled between Mr Brown and Mr Waters. So far\r\nas private feeling goes--"\r\n\r\n"Never fear, I\'ll manage it," said Jack Wentworth, "as well as a dozen\r\nlawyers. Private feeling has nothing to do with it. Have a cigar,\r\nWodehouse? We\'ll talk it over as we walk home," said the condescending\r\npotentate. These words dispersed the assembly, which no longer had any\r\nobject. As Jack Wentworth sauntered out, his faithful follower pressed\r\nthrough the others to join him. Wodehouse was himself again. He gave a\r\nsulky nod to the Curate, and said, "Good-night, parson, I don\'t owe much\r\nto you," and hastened out close upon the heels of his patron and leader.\r\nAll the authorities of Carlingford, the virtuous people who conferred\r\nstation and respectability by a look, sank into utter insignificance in\r\npresence of Jack. His admiring follower went after him with a swell of\r\npride. He was a poor enough rogue himself, hustled and abused by\r\neverybody, an unsuccessful and shabby vagabond, notwithstanding his new\r\nfortune; but Jack was the glorified impersonation of cleverness and\r\nwickedness and triumph to Wodehouse. He grew insolent when he was\r\npermitted to put his arm through that of his hero, and went off with him\r\ntrying to copy, in swagger and insolence, his careless step and\r\nwell-bred ease. Perhaps Jack Wentworth felt a little ashamed of himself\r\nas he emerged from the gate of the Rectory with his shabby and\r\ndisreputable companion. He shrugged his shoulders slightly as he looked\r\nback and saw Gerald and Frank coming slowly out together. "_Coraggio!_"\r\nsaid Jack to himself, "it is I who am the true philanthropist. Let us do\r\nevil that good may come." Notwithstanding, he was very thankful not to\r\nbe seen by his father, who had wished to consult him as a man of the\r\nworld, and had shown certain yearnings towards him, which, to Jack\'s\r\ninfinite surprise, awakened responsive feelings in his own unaccustomed\r\nbosom. He was half ashamed of this secret movement of natural affection,\r\nwhich, certainly, nobody else suspected; but it was with a sensation of\r\nrelief that he closed the Rectory gate behind him, without having\r\nencountered the keen inquiring suspicious glances of the Squire. The\r\nothers dispersed according to their pleasure--Mr Waters joining the\r\nparty up-stairs, while Mr Proctor followed Jack Wentworth and Wodehouse\r\nto the door with na\xefve natural curiosity. When the excellent man\r\nrecollected that he was listening to private conversation, and met\r\nWodehouse\'s look of sulky insolence, he turned back again, much\r\nfluttered and disturbed. He had an interest in the matter, though the\r\ntwo in whose hands it now lay were the last whom he would have chosen as\r\nconfidants; and to do him justice, he was thinking of Lucy only in his\r\ndesire to hear what they decided upon. "Something might happen to me,"\r\nhe said to himself; "and, even if all was well, she would be happier not\r\nto be wholly dependent upon her sister;" with which self-exculpatory\r\nreflection, Mr Proctor slowly followed the others into the drawing-room.\r\nGerald and Frank, who were neither of them disposed for society, went\r\naway together. They had enough to think of, without much need of\r\nconversation, and they had walked half-way down Grange Lane before\r\neither spoke. Then it was Frank who broke the silence abruptly with a\r\nquestion which had nothing to do with the business in which they had\r\nbeen engaged.\r\n\r\n"And what do you mean to do?" said Frank, suddenly. It was just as\r\nthey came in sight of the graceful spire of St Roque\'s; and perhaps it\r\nwas the sight of his own church which roused the Perpetual Curate to\r\nthink of the henceforth aimless life of his brother. "I don\'t\r\nunderstand how you are to give up your work. To-night even--"\r\n\r\n"I did not forget myself," said Gerald; "every man who can distinguish\r\ngood from evil has a right to advise his fellow-creature. I have not\r\ngiven up that common privilege--don\'t hope it, Frank," said the\r\nmartyr, with a momentary smile.\r\n\r\n"If I could but understand why it is that you make this terrible\r\nsacrifice!" said the Curate--"No, I don\'t want to argue--of course,\r\nyou are convinced. I can understand the wish that our unfortunate\r\ndivision had never taken place; but I can\'t understand the sacrifice\r\nof a man\'s life and work. Nothing is perfect in this world; but at\r\nleast to do something in it--to be good for something--and with your\r\nfaculties, Gerald!" cried the admiring and regretful brother. "Can\r\nabstract right in an institution, if that is what you aim at, be worth\r\nthe sacrifice of your existence--your power of influencing your\r\nfellow-creatures?" This Mr Wentworth said, being specially moved by\r\nthe circumstances in which he found himself--for, under any other\r\nconditions, such sentiments would have produced the warmest opposition\r\nin his Anglican bosom. But he was so far sympathetic that he could be\r\ntolerant to his brother who had gone to Rome.\r\n\r\n"I know what you mean," said Gerald; "it is the prevailing theory in\r\nEngland that all human institutions are imperfect. My dear Frank, I\r\nwant a Church which is not a human institution. In England it seems to\r\nbe the rule of faith that every man may believe as he pleases. There\r\nis no authority either to decide or to punish. If you can foresee what\r\nthat may lead us to, I cannot. I take refuge in the true Church, where\r\nalone there is certainty--where," said the convert, with a heightened\r\ncolour and a long-drawn breath, "there is authority clear and\r\ndecisive. In England you believe what you will, and the result will\r\nbe one that I at least fear to contemplate; in Rome we believe\r\nwhat--we must," said Gerald. He said the words slowly, bowing his head\r\nmore than once with determined submission, as if bending under the\r\nyoke. "Frank, it is salvation!" said the new Catholic, with the\r\nemphasis of a despairing hope. And for the first time Frank Wentworth\r\nperceived what it was which had driven his brother to Rome.\r\n\r\n"I understand you now," said the Perpetual Curate; "it is because\r\nthere is no room for our conflicting doctrines and latitude of belief.\r\nInstead of a Church happily so far imperfect, that a man can put his\r\nlife to the best account in it, without absolutely delivering up his\r\nintellect to a set of doctrines, you seek a perfect Church, in which,\r\nfor a symmetrical system of doctrine, you lose the use of your\r\nexistence!" Mr Wentworth uttered this opinion with all the more\r\nvehemence, that it was in direct opposition to his own habitual ideas;\r\nbut even his veneration for his "Mother" yielded for the moment to his\r\nstrong sense of his brother\'s mistake.\r\n\r\n"It is a hard thing to say," said Gerald, "but it is true. If you but\r\nknew the consolation, after years of struggling among the problems of\r\nfaith, to find one\'s self at last upon a rock of authority, of\r\ncertainty--one holds in one\'s hand at last the interpretation of the\r\nenigma," said Gerald. He looked up to the sky as he spoke, and\r\nbreathed into the serene air a wistful lingering sigh. If it was\r\ncertainty that echoed in that breath of unsatisfied nature, the sound\r\nwas sadly out of concord with the sentiment. His soul, notwithstanding\r\nthat expression of serenity, was still as wistful as the night.\r\n\r\n"Have you the interpretation?" said his brother; and Frank, too,\r\nlooked up into the pure sky above, with its stars which stretched over\r\nthem serene and silent, arching over the town that lay behind, and of\r\nwhich nobody knew better than he the human mysteries and wonderful\r\nunanswerable questions. The heart of the Curate ached to think how\r\nmany problems lay in the darkness, over which that sky stretched\r\nsilent, making no sign. There were the sorrowful of the earth,\r\nenduring their afflictions, lifting up pitiful hands, demanding of God\r\nin their bereavements and in their miseries the reason why. There were\r\nall the inequalities of life, side by side, evermore echoing dumbly\r\nthe same awful question; and over all shone the calm sky which gave no\r\nanswer. "Have you the interpretation?" he said. "Perhaps you can\r\nreconcile freewill and predestination--the need of a universal\r\natonement and the existence of individual virtue? But these are not to\r\nme the most difficult questions. Can your Church explain why one man\r\nis happy and another miserable?--why one has everything and abounds,\r\nand the other loses all that is most precious in life? My sister Mary,\r\nfor example," said the Curate, "she seems to bear the cross for our\r\nfamily. Her children die and yours live. Can you explain to her why? I\r\nhave heard her cry out to God to know the reason, and He made no\r\nanswer. Tell me, have you the interpretation?" cried the young man, on\r\nwhom the hardness of his own position was pressing at the moment. They\r\nwent on together in silence for a few minutes, without any attempt on\r\nGerald\'s part to answer. "You accept the explanation of the Church in\r\nrespect to doctrines," said the Curate, after that pause, "and consent\r\nthat her authority is sufficient, and that your perplexity is\r\nover--that is well enough, so far as it goes: but outside lies a world\r\nin which every event is an enigma, where nothing that comes offers any\r\nexplanation of itself; where God does not show Himself always kind,\r\nbut by times awful, terrible--a God who smites and does not spare. It\r\nis easy to make a harmonious balance of doctrine; but where is the\r\ninterpretation of life?" The young priest looked back on his memory,\r\nand recalled, as if they had been in a book, the daily problems with\r\nwhich he was so well acquainted. As for Gerald, he bowed his head a\r\nlittle, with a kind of reverence, as if he had been bowing before the\r\nshrine of a saint.\r\n\r\n"I have had a happy life," said the elder brother. "I have not been\r\ndriven to ask such questions for myself. To these the Church has but\r\none advice to offer: Trust God."\r\n\r\n"We say so in England," said Frank Wentworth; "it is the grand scope\r\nof our teaching. Trust God. He will not explain Himself, nor can we\r\nattempt it. When it is certain that I must be content with this answer\r\nfor all the sorrows of life, I am content to take my doctrines on the\r\nsame terms," said the Perpetual Curate; and by this time they had come\r\nto Miss Wentworth\'s door. After all, perhaps it was not Gerald, except\r\nso far as he was carried by a wonderful force of human sympathy and\r\npurity of soul, who was the predestined priest of the family. As he\r\nwent up to his own room, a momentary spasm of doubt came upon the new\r\nconvert--whether, perhaps, he was making a sacrifice of his life for a\r\nmistake. He hushed the thought forcibly as it rose; such impulses were\r\nno longer to be listened to. The same authority which made faith\r\ncertain, decided every doubt to be sin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI.\r\n\r\n\r\nNext morning the Curate got up with anticipations which were far from\r\ncheerful, and a weary sense of the monotony and dulness of life. He had\r\nwon his little battle, it was true; but the very victory had removed\r\nthat excitement which answered in the absence of happier stimulations to\r\nkeep up his heart and courage. After a struggle like that in which he\r\nhad been engaged, it was hard to come again into the peaceable routine\r\nwithout any particular hope to enliven or happiness to cheer it, which\r\nwas all he had at present to look for in his life; and it was harder\r\nstill to feel the necessity of being silent, of standing apart from Lucy\r\nin her need, of shutting up in his own heart the longing he had towards\r\nher, and refraining himself from the desperate thought of uniting his\r\ngenteel beggary to hers. That was the one thing which must not be\r\nthought of, and he subdued himself with an impatient sigh, and could not\r\nbut wonder, as he went down-stairs, whether, if Gerald had been less\r\nsmoothly guided through the perplexing paths of life, he would have\r\nfound time for all the difficulties which had driven him to take refuge\r\nin Rome. It was with this sense of hopeless restraint and incapacity,\r\nwhich is perhaps of all sensations the most humbling, that he went\r\ndown-stairs, and found lying on his breakfast table, the first thing\r\nthat met his eye, the note which Lucy Wodehouse had written to him on\r\nthe previous night. As he read it, the earth somehow turned to the sun;\r\nthe dubious light brightened in the skies. Unawares, he had been\r\nwondering never to receive any token of sympathy, any word of\r\nencouragement, from those for whom he had made so many exertions. When\r\nhe had read Lucy\'s letter, the aspect of affairs changed considerably.\r\nTo be sure, nothing that she had said or could say made any difference\r\nin the facts of the case; but the Curate was young, and still liable to\r\nthose changes of atmosphere which do more for an imaginative mind than\r\nreal revolutions. He read the letter several times over as he lingered\r\nthrough his breakfast, making on the whole an agreeable meal, and\r\nfinding himself repossessed of his ordinary healthful appetite. He even\r\ncanvassed the signature as much in reading as Lucy had done in writing\r\nit--balancing in his mind the maidenly "truly yours" of that\r\nsubscription with as many ingenious renderings of its possible meaning\r\nas if Lucy\'s letter had been articles of faith. "Truly mine," he said to\r\nhimself, with a smile; which indeed meant all a lover could require; and\r\nthen paused, as if he had been Dr Lushington or Lord Westbury, to\r\ninquire into the real force of the phrase. For after all, it is not only\r\nwhen signing the Articles that the bond and pledge of subscription means\r\nmore than is intended. When Mr Wentworth was able to tear himself from\r\nthe agreeable casuistry of this self-discussion, he got up in much\r\nbetter spirits to go about his daily business. First of all, he had to\r\nsee his father, and ascertain what were the Squire\'s intentions, and how\r\nlong he meant to stay in Carlingford; and then--It occurred to the\r\nPerpetual Curate that after that, politeness demanded that he should\r\ncall on the Miss Wodehouses, who had, or at least one of them, expressed\r\nso frankly their confidence in him. He could not but call to thank her,\r\nto inquire into their plans, perhaps to back aunt Leonora\'s invitation,\r\nwhich he was aware had been gratefully declined. With these ideas in his\r\nmind he went down-stairs, after brushing his hat very carefully and\r\ncasting one solicitous glance in the mirror as he passed--which\r\npresented to him a very creditable reflection, an eidolon in perfect\r\nclerical apparel, without any rusty suggestions of a Perpetual Curacy.\r\nYet a Perpetual Curacy it was which was his sole benefice or hope in his\r\npresent circumstances, for he knew very well that, were all other\r\nobjections at an end, neither Skelmersdale nor Wentworth could be kept\r\nopen for him; and that beyond these two he had not a hope of\r\nadvancement--and at the same time he was pledged to remain in\r\nCarlingford. All this, however, though discouraging enough, did not\r\nsucceed in discouraging Mr Wentworth after he had read Lucy\'s letter. He\r\nwent down-stairs so lightly that Mrs Hadwin, who was waiting in the\r\nparlour in her best cap, to ask if he would pardon her for making such a\r\nmistake, did not hear him pass, and sat waiting for an hour, forgetting,\r\nor rather neglecting to give any response, when the butcher came for\r\norders--which was an unprecedented accident. Mr Wentworth went\r\ncheerfully up Grange Lane, meeting, by a singular chance, ever so many\r\npeople, who stopped to shake hands with him, or at least bowed their\r\ngood wishes and friendly acknowledgments. He smiled in himself at these\r\nevidences of popular penitence, but was not the less pleased to find\r\nhimself reinstated in his place in the affections and respect of\r\nCarlingford. "After all, it was not an unnatural mistake," he said to\r\nhimself, and smiled benignly upon the excellent people who had found out\r\nthe error of their own ways. Carlingford, indeed, seemed altogether in a\r\nmore cheerful state than usual, and Mr Wentworth could not but think\r\nthat the community in general was glad to find that it had been\r\ndeceived, and so went upon his way, pleasing himself with those maxims\r\nabout the ultimate prevalence of justice and truth, which make it\r\napparent that goodness is always victorious, and wickedness punished, in\r\nthe end. Somehow even a popular fallacy has an aspect of truth when it\r\nsuits one\'s own case. The Perpetual Curate went through his aunts\'\r\ngarden with a conscious smile, feeling once more master of himself and\r\nhis concerns. There was, to tell the truth, even a slight shade of\r\nself-content and approbation upon his handsome countenance. In the\r\npresent changed state of public opinion and private feeling, he began to\r\ntake some pleasure in his sacrifice. To be sure, a Perpetual Curate\r\ncould not marry; but perhaps Lucy--in short, there was no telling what\r\nmight happen; and it was accordingly with that delicious sense of\r\ngoodness which generally attends an act of self-sacrifice, mingled with\r\nan equally delicious feeling that the act, when accomplished, might turn\r\nout no such great sacrifice after all--which it is to be feared is the\r\nmost usual way in which the sacrifices of youth are made--that the\r\nCurate walked into the hall, passing his aunt Dora\'s toy terrier without\r\nthat violent inclination to give it a whack with his cane in passing\r\nwhich was his usual state of feeling. To tell the truth, Lucy\'s letter\r\nhad made him at peace with all the world.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, he entered the dining-room, where the family were still\r\nat breakfast, Frank\'s serenity was unexpectedly disturbed. The first\r\nthing that met his eyes was his aunt Leonora, towering over her\r\ntea-urn at the upper end of the table, holding in her hand a letter\r\nwhich she had just opened. The envelope had fallen in the midst of the\r\nimmaculate breakfast "things," and indeed lay, with its broad black\r\nedge on the top of the snow-white lumps, in Miss Leonora\'s own\r\nsugar-basin; and the news had been sufficiently interesting to suspend\r\nthe operations of tea-making, and to bring the strong-minded woman to\r\nher feet. The first words which were audible to Frank revealed to him\r\nthe nature of the intelligence which had produced such startling\r\neffects.\r\n\r\n"He was always a contradictory man," said Miss Leonora; "since the\r\nfirst hour he was in Skelmersdale, he has made a practice of doing\r\nthings at the wrong time. I don\'t mean to reproach the poor man now\r\nhe\'s gone; but when he has been so long of going, what good could it\r\ndo him to choose this particular moment, for no other reason that I\r\ncan see, except that it was specially uncomfortable to us? What my\r\nbrother has just been saying makes it all the worse," said Miss\r\nLeonora, with a look of annoyance. She had turned her head away from\r\nthe door, which was at the side of the room, and had not perceived the\r\nentrance of the Curate. "As long as we could imagine that Frank was to\r\nsucceed to the Rectory, the thing looked comparatively easy. I beg\r\nyour pardon, Gerald. Of course, you know how grieved I am--in short,\r\nthat we all feel the deepest distress and vexation; but, to be sure,\r\nsince you have given it up, somebody must succeed you--there can be no\r\ndoubt of that."\r\n\r\n"Not the least, my dear aunt," said Gerald.\r\n\r\n"I am glad you grant so much. It is well to be sure of something," said\r\nthe incisive and peremptory speaker. "It would have been a painful thing\r\nfor us at any time to place another person in Skelmersdale while Frank\r\nwas unprovided for; but, of course," said Miss Leonora, sitting down\r\nsuddenly, "nobody who knows me could suppose for a minute that I would\r\nlet my feelings stand in the way of my public duty. Still it is very\r\nawkward just at this moment when Frank, on the whole, has been behaving\r\nvery properly, and one can\'t help so far approving of him--"\r\n\r\n"I am much obliged to you, aunt Leonora," said the Curate.\r\n\r\n"Oh, you are there, Frank," said his sensible aunt; and strong-minded\r\nthough she was, a slight shade of additional colour appeared for a\r\nmoment on Miss Leonora\'s face. She paused a little, evidently diverted\r\nfrom the line of discourse which she had contemplated, and wavered like\r\na vessel disturbed in its course. "The fact is, I have just had a letter\r\nannouncing Mr Shirley\'s death," she continued, facing round towards her\r\nnephew, and setting off abruptly, in face of all consequences, on the\r\nnew tack.\r\n\r\n"I am very sorry," said Frank Wentworth; "though I have an old grudge\r\nat him on account of his long sermons; but as you have expected it for\r\na year or two, I can\'t imagine your grief to be overwhelming," said\r\nthe Curate, with a touch of natural impertinence to be expected under\r\nthe circumstances. Skelmersdale had been so long thought interesting\r\nto him, that now, when it was not in the least interesting, he got\r\nimpatient of the name.\r\n\r\n"I quite agree with you, Frank," said Miss Wentworth. Aunt Cecilia had\r\nnot been able for a long time to agree with anybody. She had been, on\r\nthe contrary, shaking her head and shedding a few gentle tears over\r\nGerald\'s silent submission and Louisa\'s noisy lamentations. Everything\r\nwas somehow going wrong; and she who had no power to mend, at least\r\ncould not assent, and broke through her old use and wont to shake her\r\nhead, which was a thing very alarming to the family. The entire party\r\nwas moved by a sensation of pleasure to hear Miss Cecilia say, "I\r\nquite agree with you, Frank."\r\n\r\n"You are looking better this morning, my dear aunt," said Gerald. They\r\nhad a great respect for each other these two; but when Miss Cecilia\r\nturned to hear what her elder nephew was saying, her face lost the\r\nmomentary look of approval it had worn, and she again, though very\r\nsoftly, almost imperceptibly, began to shake her head.\r\n\r\n"We were not asking for your sympathy," said Miss Leonora, sharply.\r\n"Don\'t talk like a saucy boy. We were talking of our own\r\nembarrassment. There is a very excellent young man, the curate of the\r\nparish, whom Julia Trench is to be married to. By the way, of course,\r\nthis must put it off; but I was about to say, when you interrupted me,\r\nthat to give it away from you at this moment, just as you had been\r\ndoing well--doing--your duty," said Miss Leonora, with unusual\r\nhesitation, "was certainly very uncomfortable, to say the least, to\r\nus."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t let that have the slightest influence on you, I beg," cried the\r\nPerpetual Curate, with all the pride of his years. "I hope I have been\r\ndoing my duty all along," the young man added, more softly, a moment\r\nafter; upon which the Squire gave a little nod, partly of satisfaction\r\nand encouragement to his son--partly of remonstrance and protest to\r\nhis sister.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I suppose so--with the flowers at Easter, for example," said\r\nMiss Leonora, with a slight sneer. "I consider that I have stood by\r\nyou through all this business, Frank--but, of course, in so important\r\na matter as a cure of souls, neither relationship, nor, to a certain\r\nextent, approval," said Miss Leonora, with again some hesitation, "can\r\nbe allowed to stand against public duty. We have the responsibility of\r\nproviding a good gospel minister--"\r\n\r\n"I beg your pardon for interrupting you, Leonora," said the Squire,\r\n"but I can\'t help thinking that you make a mistake. I think it\'s a\r\nman\'s bounden duty, when there is a living in the family, to educate\r\none of his sons for it. In my opinion, it\'s one of the duties of\r\nproperty. You have no right to live off your estate, and spend your\r\nmoney elsewhere; and no more have you any right to give less\r\nthan--than your own flesh and blood to the people you have the charge\r\nof. You\'ve got the charge of them to--to a certain extent--soul and\r\nbody, sir," said the Squire, growing warm, as he put down his \'Times,\'\r\nand forgetting that he addressed a lady. "I\'d never have any peace of\r\nmind if I filled up a family living with a stranger--unless, of\r\ncourse," Mr Wentworth added in a parenthesis--an unlikely sort of\r\ncontingency which had not occurred to him at first--"you should happen\r\nto have no second son.--The eldest the squire, the second the rector.\r\nThat\'s my idea, Leonora, of Church and State."\r\n\r\nMiss Leonora smiled a little at her brother\'s semi-feudal, semi-pagan\r\nideas. "I have long known that we were not of the same way of thinking,"\r\nsaid the strong-minded aunt, who, though cleverer than her brother, was\r\ntoo wise in her own conceit to perceive at the first glance the noble,\r\nsimple conception of his own duties and position, which was implied in\r\nthe honest gentleman\'s words. "Your second son might be either a fool or\r\na knave, or even, although neither, might be quite unfit to be intrusted\r\nwith the eternal interests of his fellow-creatures. In my opinion, the\r\nduty of choosing a clergyman is one not to be exercised without the\r\ngravest deliberation. A conscientious man would make his selection\r\ndependent, at least, upon the character of his second son--if he had\r\none. We, however--"\r\n\r\n"But then his character is _so_ satisfactory, Leonora," cried Miss\r\nDora, feeling emboldened by the shadow of visitors under whose shield\r\nshe could always retire. "Everybody knows what a good clergyman he\r\nis--I am sure it would be like a new world in Skelmersdale if you were\r\nthere, Frank, my dear--and he preaches such beautiful sermons!" said\r\nthe unlucky little woman, upon whom her sister immediately descended,\r\nswift and sudden, like a storm at sea.\r\n\r\n"We are generally perfectly of accord in our conclusions," said Miss\r\nLeonora; "as for Dora, she comes to the same end by a roundabout way.\r\nAfter what my brother has been saying--"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said the Squire, with uncomfortable looks, "I was saying to\r\nyour aunt, Frank, what I said to you about poor Mary. Since Gerald\r\n_will_ go, and since you don\'t want to come, the best thing to do\r\nwould be to have Huxtable. He\'s a very good fellow on the whole, and\r\nit might cheer her up, poor soul, to be near her sisters. Life has\r\nbeen hard work to her, poor girl--very hard work, sir," said the\r\nSquire, with a sigh. The idea was troublesome and uncomfortable, and\r\nalways disturbed his mind when it occurred to him. It was indeed a\r\nsecret humiliation to the Squire, that his eldest daughter possessed\r\nso little the characteristic health and prosperity of the Wentworths.\r\nHe was very sorry for her, but yet half angry and half ashamed, as if\r\nshe could have helped it; but, however, he had been obliged to admit,\r\nin his private deliberations on the subject, that, failing Frank,\r\nMary\'s husband had the next best right to Wentworth Rectory--an\r\narrangement of which Miss Leonora did not approve.\r\n\r\n"I was about to say that we have no second son," she said, taking up the\r\nthread of her discourse where it had been interrupted. "Our duty is\r\nsolely towards the Christian people. I do not pretend to be infallible,"\r\nsaid Miss Leonora, with a meek air of self-contradiction; "but I should\r\nbe a very poor creature indeed, if, at my age, I did not know what I\r\nbelieved, and was not perfectly convinced that I am right. Consequently\r\n(though, I repeat, Mr Shirley has chosen the most inconvenient moment\r\npossible for dying), it can\'t be expected of me that I should appoint my\r\nnephew, whose opinions in most points are exactly the opposite of mine."\r\n\r\n"I wish, at least, you would believe what I say," interrupted the\r\nCurate, impatiently. "There might have been some sense in all this\r\nthree months ago; but if Skelmersdale were the high-road to everything\r\ndesirable in the Church, you are all quite aware that I could not\r\naccept it. Stop, Gerald; I am not so disinterested as you think," said\r\nFrank; "if I left Carlingford now, people would remember against me\r\nthat my character had been called in question here. I can remain a\r\nperpetual curate," said the young man, with a smile, "but I can\'t\r\ntolerate any shadow upon my honour. I am sorry I came in at such an\r\nawkward moment. Good morning, aunt Leonora. I hope Julia Trench, when\r\nshe has the Rectory, will always keep of your way of thinking. She\r\nused to incline a little to mine," he said, mischievously, as he went\r\naway.\r\n\r\n"Come back, Frank, presently," said the Squire, whose attention had\r\nbeen distracted from his \'Times.\' Mr Wentworth began to be tired of\r\nsuch a succession of exciting discussions. He thought if he had Frank\r\nquietly to himself he could settle matters much more agreeably; but\r\nthe \'Times\' was certainly an accompaniment more tranquillising so far\r\nas a comfortable meal was concerned.\r\n\r\n"He can\'t come back presently," said aunt Leonora. "You speak as if he\r\nhad nothing to do; when, on the contrary, he has everything to\r\ndo--that is worth doing," said that contradictory authority. "Come\r\nback to lunch, Frank; and I wish you would eat your breakfast, Dora,\r\nand not stare at me."\r\n\r\nMiss Dora had come down to breakfast as an invalid, in a pretty little\r\ncap, with a shawl over her dressing-gown. She had not yet got over her\r\nadventure and the excitement of Rosa\'s capture. That unusual accident,\r\nand all the applauses of her courage which had been addressed to her\r\nsince, had roused the timid woman. She did not withdraw her eyes from\r\nher sister, though commanded to do so; on the contrary, her look grew\r\nmore and more emphatic. She meant to have made a solemn address,\r\nthrowing off Leonora\'s yoke, and declaring her intention, in this grave\r\ncrisis of her nephew\'s fortunes, of acting for herself; but her feelings\r\nwere too much for Miss Dora. The tears came creeping to the corners of\r\nher eyes, and she could not keep them back; and her attempt at dignity\r\nbroke down. "I am never consulted," she said, with a gasp. "I don\'t mean\r\nto pretend to know better than Leonora; but--but I think it is very\r\nhard that Frank should be disappointed about Skelmersdale. You may call\r\nme as foolish as you please," said Miss Dora, with rising tears, "I know\r\neverybody will say it is my fault; but I must say I think it is very\r\nhard that Frank should be disappointed. He was always brought up for it,\r\nas everybody knows; and to disappoint him, who is so good and so nice,\r\nfor a fat young man, buttered all over like--like--a pudding-basin,"\r\ncried poor Miss Dora, severely adhering to the unity of her desperate\r\nmetaphor. "I don\'t know what Julia Trench can be thinking of; I--I don\'t\r\nknow what Leonora means."\r\n\r\n"I am of the same way of thinking," said aunt Cecilia, setting down,\r\nwith a little gentle emphasis, her cup of tea.\r\n\r\nHere was rebellion, open and uncompromised. Miss Leonora was so much\r\ntaken by surprise, that she lifted the tea-urn out of the way, and\r\nstared at her interlocutors with genuine amazement. But she proved\r\nherself, as usual, equal to the occasion.\r\n\r\n"It\'s unfortunate that we never see eye to eye just at once," she\r\nsaid, with a look which expressed more distinctly than words could\r\nhave done the preliminary flourish of his whip by means of which a\r\nskilful charioteer gets his team under hand without touching them;\r\n"but it is very lucky that we always come to agree in the end," she\r\nadded, more significantly still. It was well to crush insubordination\r\nin the bud. Not that she did not share the sentiment of her sisters;\r\nbut then they were guided like ordinary women by their feelings;\r\nwhereas Miss Leonora had the rights of property before her, and the\r\napproval of Exeter Hall.\r\n\r\n"And he wants to marry, poor dear boy," said Miss Dora, pale with\r\nfright, yet persevering; "and she is a dear good girl--the very person\r\nfor a clergyman\'s wife; and what is he to do if he is always to be\r\nCurate of St Roque\'s? You may say it is my fault, but I cannot help it.\r\nHe always used to come to me in all his little troubles; and when he\r\nwants anything very particular, he knows there is nothing I would not do\r\nfor him," sobbed the proud aunt, who could not help recollecting how\r\nmuch use she had been to Frank. She wiped her eyes at the thought, and\r\nheld up her head with a thrill of pride and satisfaction. Nobody could\r\nblame her in that particular at least. "He knew he had only to tell me\r\nwhat he wanted," said Miss Dora, swelling out her innocent plumes. Jack,\r\nwho was sitting opposite, and who had been listening with admiration,\r\nthought it time to come in on his own part.\r\n\r\n"I hope you don\'t mean to forsake _me_, aunt Dora," he said. "If a\r\npoor fellow cannot have faith in his aunt, whom can he have faith in?\r\nI thought it was too good to last," said the neglected prodigal. "You\r\nhave left the poor sheep in the wilderness and gone back to the\r\nninety-and-nine righteous men who need no repentance." He put up his\r\nhandkerchief to his eyes as he spoke, and so far forgot himself as to\r\nlook with laughter in his face at his brother Gerald. As for the\r\nSquire, he was startled to hear his eldest son quoting Scripture, and\r\nlaid aside his paper once more to know what it meant.\r\n\r\n"I am sure I beg your pardon, Jack," said aunt Dora, suddenly stopping\r\nshort, and feeling guilty. "I never meant to neglect you. Poor dear\r\nboy, he never was properly tried with female society and the comforts\r\nof home; but then you were dining out that night," said the simple\r\nwoman, eagerly. "I should have stayed with you, Jack, _of course_, had\r\nyou been at home."\r\n\r\nFrom this little scene Miss Leonora turned away hastily, with an\r\nexclamation of impatience. She made an abrupt end of her tea-making,\r\nand went off to her little business-room with a grim smile upon her\r\niron-grey countenance. She too had been taken in a little by Jack\'s\r\npleasant farce of the Sinner Repentant; and it occurred to her to feel a\r\nlittle ashamed of herself as she went up-stairs. After all, the\r\nninety-and-nine just men of Jack\'s irreverent quotation were worth\r\nconsidering now and then; and Miss Leonora could not but think with a\r\nlittle humiliation of the contrast between her nephew Frank and the\r\ncomfortable young Curate who was going to marry Julia Trench. He _was_\r\nfat, it could not be denied; and she remembered his chubby looks, and\r\nhis sermons about self-denial and mortification of the flesh, much as a\r\npious Catholic might think of the Lenten oratory of a fat friar. But\r\nthen he was perfectly sound in his doctrines, and it was undeniable that\r\nthe people liked him, and that the appointment was one which even a\r\nScotch ecclesiastical community full of popular rights could scarcely\r\nhave objected to. According to her own principles, the strong-minded\r\nwoman could not do otherwise. She threw herself into her arm-chair with\r\nunnecessary force, and read over the letter which Miss Trench herself\r\nhad written. "It is difficult to think of any consolation in such a\r\nbereavement," wrote Mr Shirley\'s niece; "but still it is a little\r\ncomfort to feel that I can throw myself on your sympathy, my dear and\r\nkind friend." "Little calculating thing!" Miss Leonora said to herself\r\nas she threw down the mournful epistle; and then she could not help\r\nthinking again of Frank. To be sure, he was not of her way of thinking;\r\nbut when she remembered the "investigation" and its result, and the\r\nsecret romance involved in it, her Wentworth blood sent a thrill of\r\npride and pleasure through her veins. Miss Leonora, though she was\r\nstrong-minded, was still woman enough to perceive her nephew\'s motives\r\nin his benevolence to Wodehouse; but these motives, which were strong\r\nenough to make him endure so much annoyance, were not strong enough to\r\ntempt him from Carlingford and his Perpetual Curacy, where his honour\r\nand reputation, in the face of love and ambition, demanded that he\r\nshould remain. "It would be a pity to balk him in his self-sacrifice,"\r\nshe said to herself, with again a somewhat grim smile, and a comparison\r\nnot much to the advantage of Julia Trench and _her_ curate. She shut\r\nherself up among her papers till luncheon, and only emerged with a\r\nstormy front when that meal was on the table; during the progress of\r\nwhich she snubbed everybody who ventured to speak to her, and spoke to\r\nher nephew Frank as if he might have been suspected of designs upon the\r\nplate-chest. Such were the unpleasant consequences of the struggle\r\nbetween duty and inclination in the bosom of Miss Leonora; and, save for\r\nother unforeseen events which decided the matter for her, it is not by\r\nany means so certain as, judging from her character, it ought to have\r\nbeen, that duty would have won the day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrank Wentworth once more went up Grange Lane, a thoughtful and a sober\r\nman. Exhilaration comes but by moments in the happiest of lives--and\r\nalready he began to remember how very little he had to be elated about,\r\nand how entirely things remained as before. Even Lucy; her letter very\r\nprobably might be only an effusion of friendship; and at all events,\r\nwhat could he say to her--what did he dare in honour say? And then his\r\nmind went off to think of the two rectories, between which he had fallen\r\nas between two stools: though he had made up his mind to accept neither,\r\nhe did not the less feel a certain mortification in seeing that his\r\nrelations on both sides were so willing to bestow their gifts elsewhere.\r\nHe could not tolerate the idea of succeeding Gerald in his own person,\r\nbut still he found it very disagreeable to consent to the thought that\r\nHuxtable should replace him--Huxtable, who was a good fellow enough, but\r\nof whom Frank Wentworth thought, as men generally think of their\r\nbrothers-in-law, with a half-impatient, half-contemptuous wonder what\r\nMary could ever have seen in so commonplace a man. To think of him as\r\nrector of Wentworth inwardly chafed the spirit of the Perpetual Curate.\r\nAs he was going along, absorbed in his own thoughts, he did not\r\nperceive how his approach was watched for from the other side of the way\r\nby Elsworthy, who stood with his bundle of newspapers under his arm and\r\nhis hat in his hand, watching for "his clergyman" with submission and\r\napology on the surface, and hidden rancour underneath. Elsworthy was not\r\npenitent; he was furious and disappointed. His mistake and its\r\nconsequences were wholly humiliating, and had not in them a single\r\nsaving feature to atone for the wounds of his self-esteem. The Curate\r\nhad not only baffled and beaten him, but humbled him in his own eyes,\r\nwhich is perhaps, of all others, the injury least easy to forgive. It\r\nwas, however, with an appearance of the profoundest submission that he\r\nstood awaiting the approach of the man he had tried so much to injure.\r\n\r\n"Mr Wentworth, sir," said Elsworthy, "if I was worth your while, I\r\nmight think as you were offended with me; but seeing I\'m one as is so\r\nfar beneath you"--he went on with a kind of grin, intended to\r\nrepresent a deprecatory smile, but which would have been a snarl had\r\nhe dared--"I can\'t think as you\'ll bear no malice. May I ask, sir, if\r\nthere\'s a-going to be any difference made?"\r\n\r\n"In what respect, Elsworthy?" said the Curate, shortly.\r\n\r\n"Well, sir, I can\'t tell," said the clerk of St Roque\'s. "If a\r\nclergyman was to bear malice, it\'s in his power to make things very\r\nunpleasant. I don\'t speak of the place at church, which aint either\r\nhere nor there--it\'s respectable, but it aint lucrative; but if you\r\nwas to stretch a point, Mr Wentworth, by continuing the papers and\r\nsuchlike--it aint that I value the money," said Elsworthy, "but I\'ve\r\nbeen a faithful servant; and I might say, if you was to take it in a\r\nright spirit, an \'umble friend, Mr Wentworth," he continued, after a\r\nlittle pause, growing bolder. "And now, as I\'ve that unfortunate\r\ncreature to provide for, and no one knowing what\'s to become of her--"\r\n\r\n"I wonder that you venture to speak of her to me," said the Curate,\r\nwith a little indignation, "after all the warnings I gave you. But\r\nyou ought to consider that you are to blame a great deal more than she\r\nis. She is only a child; if you had taken better care of her--but you\r\nwould not pay any attention to my warning;--you must bear the\r\nconsequences as you best can."\r\n\r\n"Well, sir," said Elsworthy, "if you\'re a-going to bear malice, I\r\nhaven\'t got nothing to say. But there aint ten men in Carlingford as\r\nwouldn\'t agree with me that when a young gentleman, even if he is a\r\nclergyman, takes particklar notice of a pretty young girl, it aint\r\njust for nothing as he does it--not to say watching over her paternal\r\nto see as she wasn\'t out late at night, and suchlike. But bygones is\r\nbygones, sir," said Elsworthy, "and is never more to be mentioned by\r\nme. I don\'t ask no more, if you\'ll but do the same--"\r\n\r\n"You won\'t ask no more?" said the Curate, angrily; "do you think I am\r\nafraid of you? I have nothing more to say, Elsworthy. Go and look\r\nafter your business--I will attend to mine; and when we are not forced\r\nto meet, let us keep clear of each other. It will be better both for\r\nyou and me."\r\n\r\nThe Curate passed on with an impatient nod; but his assailant did not\r\nintend that he should escape so easily. "I shouldn\'t have thought,\r\nsir, as you\'d have borne malice," said Elsworthy, hastening on after\r\nhim, yet keeping half a step behind. "I\'m a humbled man--different\r\nfrom what I ever thought to be. I could always keep up my head afore\r\nthe world till now; and if it aint your fault, sir--as I humbly beg\r\nyour pardon for ever being so far led away as to believe it was--all\r\nthe same it\'s along of you."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?" said the Curate, who, half amused and half\r\nindignant at the change of tone, had slackened his pace to listen to\r\nthis new accusation.\r\n\r\n"What I mean, sir, is, that if you hadn\'t been so good and so\r\nkind-hearted as to take into your house the--the villain as has done\r\nit all, him and Rosa could never have known each other. I allow as it\r\nwas nothing but your own goodness as did it; but it was a black day\r\nfor me and mine," said the dramatist, with a pathetic turn of voice.\r\n"Not as I\'m casting no blame on you, as is well known to be--"\r\n\r\n"Never mind what I\'m well known to be," said the Curate; "the other day\r\nyou thought _I_ was the villain. If you can tell me anything you want me\r\nto do, I will understand that--but I am not desirous to know your\r\nopinion of me," said the careless young man. As he stood listening\r\nimpatiently, pausing a second time, Dr Marjoribanks came out to his door\r\nand stepped into his brougham to go off to his morning round of visits.\r\nThe Doctor took off his hat when he saw the Curate, and waved it to him\r\ncheerfully with a gesture of congratulation. Dr Marjoribanks was quite\r\nstanch and honest, and would have manfully stood by his intimates in\r\ndangerous circumstances; but somehow he preferred success. It was\r\npleasanter to be able to congratulate people than to condole with them.\r\nHe preferred it, and nobody could object to so orthodox a sentiment.\r\nMost probably, if Mr Wentworth had still been in partial disgrace, the\r\nDoctor would not have seen him in his easy glance down the road; but\r\nthough Mr Wentworth was aware of that, the mute congratulation had yet\r\nits effect upon him. He was moved by that delicate symptom of how the\r\nwind was blowing in Carlingford, and forgot all about Elsworthy, though\r\nthe man was standing by his side.\r\n\r\n"As you\'re so good as to take it kind, sir," said the clerk of St\r\nRoque\'s--"and, as I was a-saying, it\'s well known as you\'re always\r\nready to hear a poor man\'s tale--perhaps you\'d let bygones be bygones,\r\nand not make no difference? That wasn\'t all, Mr Wentworth," he\r\ncontinued eagerly, as the Curate gave an impatient nod, and turned to\r\ngo on. "I\'ve heard as this villain is rich, sir, by means of robbing\r\nof his own flesh and blood;--but it aint for me to trust to what folks\r\nsays, after the experience I\'ve had, and never can forgive myself for\r\nbeing led away," said Elsworthy; "it\'s well known in Carlingford--"\r\n\r\n"For heaven\'s sake come to the point and be done with it," said the\r\nCurate. "What is it you want me to do?"\r\n\r\n"Sir," said Elsworthy, solemnly, "you\'re a real gentleman, and you\r\ndon\'t bear no malice for what was a mistake--and you aint one to turn\r\nyour back on an unfortunate family--and Mr Wentworth, sir, you aint\r\na-going to stand by and see me and mine wronged, as have always wished\r\nyou well. If we can\'t get justice of him, we can get damages," cried\r\nElsworthy. "He aint to be let off as if he\'d done no harm--and seeing\r\nas it was along of you--"\r\n\r\n"Hold your tongue, sir!" cried the Curate. "I have nothing to do with\r\nit. Keep out of my way, or at least learn to restrain your tongue. No\r\nmore, not a word more," said the young man, indignantly. He went off\r\nwith such a sweep and wind of anger and annoyance, that the slower and\r\nolder complainant had no chance to follow him. Elsworthy accordingly\r\nwent off to the shop, where his errand-boys were waiting for the\r\nnewspapers, and where Rosa lay up-stairs, weeping, in a dark room, where\r\nher enraged aunt had shut her up. Mrs Elsworthy had shut up the poor\r\nlittle pretty wretch, who might have been penitent under better\r\nguidance, but who by this time had lost what sense of shame and wrong\r\nher childish conscience was capable of in the stronger present sense of\r\ninjury and resentment and longing to escape; but the angry aunt, though\r\nshe could turn the key on poor Rosa\'s unfortunate little person, could\r\nnot shut in the piteous sobs which now and then sounded through and\r\nthrough the house, and which converted all the errand-boys without\r\nexception into indignant partisans of Rosa, and even moved the heart of\r\nPeter Hayles, who could hear them at the back window where he was making\r\nup Dr Marjoribanks\'s prescriptions. As the sense of injury waxed\r\nstronger and stronger in Rosa\'s bosom, she availed herself, like any\r\nother irrational, irresponsible creature, of such means of revenging\r\nherself and annoying her keepers as occurred to her. "Nobody ever took\r\nno care of me," sobbed Rosa. "I never had no father or mother. Oh, I\r\nwish I was dead!--and nobody wouldn\'t care!" These utterances, it may be\r\nimagined, went to the very heart of the errand-boys, who were collected\r\nin a circle, plotting how to release Rosa, when Elsworthy, mortified and\r\nfurious, came back from his unsuccessful assault on the Curate. They\r\nscattered like a covey of little birds before the angry man, who tossed\r\ntheir papers at them, and then strode up the echoing stairs. "If you\r\ndon\'t hold your d----d tongue," said Elsworthy, knocking furiously at\r\nRosa\'s door, "I\'ll turn you to the door this instant, I will, by--."\r\nNobody in Carlingford had ever before heard an oath issue from the\r\nrespectable lips of the clerk of St Roque\'s. When he went down into the\r\nshop again, the outcries sank into frightened moans. Not much wonder\r\nthat the entire neighbourhood became as indignant with Elsworthy as it\r\never had been with the Perpetual Curate. The husband and wife took up\r\ntheir positions in the shop after this, as far apart as was possible\r\nfrom each other, both resenting in silent fury the wrong which the world\r\nin general had done them. If Mrs Elsworthy had dared, she would have\r\nexhausted her passion in abuse of everybody--of the Curate for not being\r\nguilty, of her husband for supposing him to be so, and, to be sure, of\r\nRosa herself, who was the cause of all. But Elsworthy was dangerous, not\r\nto be approached or spoken to. He went out about noon to see John Brown,\r\nand discuss with him the question of damages; but the occurrences which\r\ntook place in his absence are not to be mixed up with the present\r\nnarrative, which concerns Mr Frank Wentworth\'s visit to Lucy Wodehouse,\r\nand has nothing to do with ignoble hates or loves.\r\n\r\nThe Curate went rapidly on to the green door, which once more looked\r\nlike a gate of paradise. He did not know in the least what he was\r\ngoing to do or say--he was only conscious of a state of exaltation, a\r\ncondition of mind which might precede great happiness or great misery,\r\nbut had nothing in it of the common state of affairs in which people\r\nask each other "How do you do?" Notwithstanding, the fact is, that\r\nwhen Lucy entered that dear familiar drawing-room, where every feature\r\nand individual expression of every piece of furniture was as well\r\nknown to him as if they had been so many human faces, it was only "How\r\ndo you do?" that the Curate found himself able to say. The two shook\r\nhands as demurely as if Lucy had indeed been, according to the\r\ndeceptive representation of yesterday, as old as aunt Dora; and then\r\nshe seated herself in her favourite chair, and tried to begin a little\r\nconversation about things in general. Even in these three days, nature\r\nand youth had done something for Lucy. She had slept and rested, and\r\nthe unforeseen misfortune which had come in to distract her grief had\r\nroused all the natural strength that was in her. As she was a little\r\nnervous about this interview, not knowing what it might end in, Lucy\r\nthought it her duty to be as composed and self-commanding as possible,\r\nand, in order to avoid all dangerous and exciting subjects, began to\r\ntalk of Wharfside.\r\n\r\n"I have not heard anything for three or four days about the poor woman\r\nat No. 10," she said; "I meant to have gone to see her to-day, but\r\nsomehow one gets so selfish when--when one\'s mind is full of affairs\r\nof one\'s own."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said the Curate; "and speaking of that, I wanted to tell you\r\nhow much comfort your letter had been to me. My head, too, has been\r\nvery full of affairs of my own. I thought at one time that my friends\r\nwere forsaking me. It was very good of you to write as you did."\r\n\r\nUpon which there followed another little pause. "Indeed the goodness\r\nwas all on your side," said Lucy, faltering. "If I had ever dreamt how\r\nmuch you were doing for us! but it all came upon me so suddenly. It is\r\nimpossible ever to express in words one-half of the gratitude we owe\r\nyou," she said, with restrained enthusiasm. She looked up at him as\r\nshe spoke with a little glow of natural fervour, which brought the\r\ncolour to her cheek and the moisture to her eyes. She was not of the\r\ndisposition to give either thanks or confidence by halves; and even\r\nthe slight not unpleasant sense of danger which gave piquancy to this\r\ninterview, made her resolute to express herself fully. She would not\r\nsuffer herself to stint her gratitude because of the sweet suspicion\r\nwhich would not be quite silenced, that possibly Mr Wentworth looked\r\nfor something better than gratitude. Not for any consequences, however\r\nmuch they might be to be avoided, could she be shabby enough to\r\nrefrain from due acknowledgment of devotion so great. Therefore, while\r\nthe Perpetual Curate was doing all he could to remind himself of his\r\ncondition, and to persuade himself that it would be utterly wrong and\r\nmean of him to speak, Lucy looked up at him, looked him in the face,\r\nwith her blue eyes shining dewy and sweet through tears of gratitude\r\nand a kind of generous admiration; for, like every other woman, she\r\nfelt herself exalted and filled with a delicious pride in seeing that\r\nthe man of her unconscious choice had proved himself the best.\r\n\r\nThe Curate walked to the window, very much as Mr Proctor had done, in\r\nthe tumult and confusion of his heart, and came back again with what\r\nhe had to say written clear on his face, without any possibility of\r\nmistake. "I must speak," said the young man; "I have no right to\r\nspeak, I know; if I had attained the height of self-sacrifice and\r\nself-denial, I might, I would be silent--but it is impossible now." He\r\ncame to a break just then, looking at her to see what encouragement he\r\nhad to go on; but as Lucy did nothing but listen and grow pale, he had\r\nto take his own way. "What I have to say is not anything new," said\r\nthe Curate, labouring a little in his voice, as was inevitable when\r\naffairs had come to such a crisis, "if I were not in the cruelest\r\nposition possible to a man. I have only an empty love to lay at your\r\nfeet; I tell it to you only because I am obliged--because, after all,\r\nlove is worth telling, even if it comes to nothing. I am not going to\r\nappeal to your generosity," continued the young man, kneeling down at\r\nthe table, not by way of kneeling to Lucy, but by way of bringing\r\nhimself on a level with her, where she sat with her head bent down on\r\nher low chair, "or to ask you to bind yourself to a man who has\r\nnothing in the world but love to offer you; but after what has been\r\nfor years, after all the hours I have spent here, I cannot--part--I\r\ncannot let you go--without a word--"\r\n\r\nAnd here he stopped short. He had not asked anything, so that Lucy,\r\neven had she been able, had nothing to answer; and as for the young\r\nlover himself, he seemed to have come to the limit of his eloquence.\r\nHe kept waiting for a moment, gazing at her in breathless expectation\r\nof a response for which his own words had left no room. Then he rose\r\nin an indescribable tumult of disappointment and mortification--unable\r\nto conclude that all was over, unable to keep silence, yet not knowing\r\nwhat to say.\r\n\r\n"I have been obliged to close all the doors of advancement upon\r\nmyself," said the Curate, with a little bitterness; "I don\'t know if\r\nyou understand me. At this moment I have to deny myself the dearest\r\nprivilege of existence. Don\'t mistake me, Lucy," he said, after\r\nanother pause, coming back to her with humility, "I don\'t venture to\r\nsay that you would have accepted anything I had to offer; but this I\r\nmean, that to have a home for you now--to have a life for you ready to\r\nbe laid at your feet, whether you would have had it or not;--what\r\nright have I to speak of such delights?" cried the young man. "It does\r\nnot matter to you; and as for me, I have patience--patience to console\r\nmyself with--"\r\n\r\nPoor Lucy, though she was on the verge of tears, which nothing but the\r\nmost passionate self-restraint could have kept in, could not help a\r\npassing sensation of amusement at these words. "Not too much of that\r\neither," she said, softly, with a tremulous smile. "But patience\r\ncarries the lilies of the saints," said Lucy, with a touch of the sweet\r\nasceticism which had once been so charming to the young Anglican. It\r\nbrought him back like a spell to the common ground on which they used to\r\nmeet; it brought him back also to his former position on his knee,\r\nwhich was embarrassing to Lucy, though she had not the heart to draw\r\nback, nor even to withdraw her hand, which somehow happened to be in Mr\r\nWentworth\'s way.\r\n\r\n"I am but a man," said the young lover. "I would rather have the roses\r\nof life--but, Lucy, I am only a perpetual curate," he continued, with\r\nher hand in his. Her answer was made in the most heartless and\r\nindifferent words. She let two big drops--which fell like hail, though\r\nthey were warmer than any summer rain--drop out of her eyes, and she\r\nsaid, with lips that had some difficulty in enunciating that heartless\r\nsentiment, "I don\'t see what it matters to me--"\r\n\r\nWhich was true enough, though it did not sound encouraging; and it\r\nis dreadful to confess that, for a little while after, neither\r\nSkelmersdale, nor Wentworth, nor Mr Proctor\'s new rectory, nor the\r\nno-income of the Perpetual Curate of St Roque\'s, had the smallest place\r\nin the thoughts of either of these perfectly inconsiderate young people.\r\nFor half an hour they were an Emperor and Empress seated upon two\r\nthrones, to which all the world was subject; and when at the end of that\r\ntime they began to remember the world, it was but to laugh at it in\r\ntheir infinite youthful superiority. Then it became apparent that to\r\nremain in Carlingford, to work at "the district," to carry out all the\r\nancient intentions of well-doing which had been the first bond between\r\nthem, was, after all, the life of lives;--which was the state of mind\r\nthey had both arrived at when Miss Wodehouse, who thought they had been\r\ntoo long together under the circumstances, and could not help wondering\r\nwhat Mr Wentworth could be saying, came into the room, rather flurried\r\nin her own person. She thought Lucy must have been telling the Curate\r\nabout Mr Proctor and his hopes, and was, to tell the truth, a little\r\ncurious how Mr Wentworth would take it, and a little--the very\r\nleast--ashamed of encountering his critical looks. The condition of mind\r\ninto which Miss Wodehouse was thrown when she perceived the real state\r\nof affairs would be difficult to describe. She was very glad and very\r\nsorry, and utterly puzzled how they were to live; and underneath all\r\nthese varying emotions was a sudden, half-ludicrous, half-humiliating\r\nsense of being cast into the shade, which made Mr Proctor\'s _fianc\xe9e_\r\nlaugh and made her cry, and brought her down altogether off the\r\ntemporary pedestal upon which she had stepped, not without a little\r\nfeminine satisfaction. When a woman is going to be married, especially\r\nif that marriage falls later than usual, it is natural that she should\r\nexpect, for that time at least, to be the first and most prominent\r\nfigure in her little circle. But, alas! what chance could there be for a\r\nmild, dove-coloured bride of forty beside a creature of half her age,\r\nendued with all the natural bloom and natural interest of youth?\r\n\r\nMiss Wodehouse could not quite make out her own feelings on the subject.\r\n"Don\'t you think if you had waited a little it would have been wiser?"\r\nshe said, in her timid way; and then kissed her young sister, and said,\r\n"I am so glad, my darling--I am sure dear papa would have been pleased,"\r\nwith a sob which brought back to Lucy the grief from which she had for\r\nthe moment escaped. Under all the circumstances, however, it may well be\r\nsupposed that it was rather hard upon Mr Wentworth to recollect that he\r\nhad engaged to return to luncheon with the Squire, and to prepare\r\nhimself after this momentous morning\'s work, to face all the\r\ncomplications of the family, where still Skelmersdale and Wentworth were\r\nhanging in the balance, and where the minds of his kith and kin were\r\nalready too full of excitement to leave much room for another event. He\r\nwent away reluctantly enough out of the momentary paradise where his\r\nPerpetual Curacy was a matter of utter indifference, if not a tender\r\npleasantry, which rather increased than diminished the happiness of the\r\nmoment--into the ordinary daylight world, where it was a very serious\r\nmatter, and where what the young couple would have to live upon became\r\nthe real question to be considered. Mr Wentworth met Wodehouse as he\r\nwent out, which did not mend matters. The vagabond was loitering about\r\nin the garden, attended by one of Elsworthy\'s errand-boys, with whom he\r\nwas in earnest conversation, and stopped in his talk to give a sulky nod\r\nand "Good morning," to which the Curate had no desire to respond more\r\nwarmly than was necessary. Lucy was thinking of nothing but himself, and\r\nperhaps a little of the "great work" at Wharfside, which her father\'s\r\nillness and death had interrupted; but Mr Wentworth, who was only a man,\r\nremembered that Tom Wodehouse would be his brother-in-law with a\r\ndistinct sensation of disgust, even in the moment of his triumph--which\r\nis one instance of the perennial inequality between the two halves of\r\nmankind. He had to brace himself up to the encounter of all his people,\r\nwhile she had to meet nothing less delightful than her own dreams. This\r\nwas how matters came to an issue in respect of Frank Wentworth\'s\r\npersonal happiness. His worldly affairs were all astray as yet, and he\r\nhad not the most distant indication of any gleam of light dawning upon\r\nthe horizon which could reconcile his duty and honour with good fortune\r\nand the delights of life. Meanwhile other discussions were going on in\r\nCarlingford, of vital importance to the two young people who had made up\r\ntheir minds to cast themselves upon Providence. And among the various\r\nconversations which were being carried on about the same moment in\r\nrespect to Mr Wentworth--whose affairs, as was natural, were extensively\r\ncanvassed in Grange Lane, as well as in other less exclusive\r\nquarters--it would be wrong to omit a remarkable consultation which took\r\nplace in the Rectory, where Mrs Morgan sat in the midst of the great\r\nbouquets of the drawing-room carpet, making up her first matrimonial\r\ndifficulty. It would be difficult to explain what influence the\r\ndrawing-room carpet in the Rectory had on the fortunes of the Perpetual\r\nCurate; but when Mr Wentworth\'s friends come to hear the entire outs and\r\nins of the business, it will be seen that it was not for nothing that\r\nMr Proctor covered the floor of that pretty apartment with roses and\r\nlilies half a yard long.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese were eventful days in Grange Lane, when gossip was not nearly\r\nrapid enough to follow the march of events. When Mr Wentworth went to\r\nlunch with his family, the two sisters kept together in the\r\ndrawing-room, which seemed again re-consecrated to the purposes of\r\nlife. Lucy had not much inclination just at that moment to move out of\r\nher chair; she was not sociable, to tell the truth, nor disposed to\r\ntalk even about the new prospects which were brightening over both.\r\nShe even took out her needlework, to the disgust of her sister. "When\r\nthere are so many things to talk about, and so much to be considered,"\r\nMiss Wodehouse said, with a little indignation; and wondered within\r\nherself whether Lucy was really insensible to "what had happened," or\r\nwhether the sense of duty was strong upon her little sister even in\r\nthe height of her happiness. A woman of greater experience or\r\ndiscrimination might have perceived that Lucy had retired into that\r\nsacred silence, sweetest of all youthful privileges, in which she\r\ncould dream over to herself the wonderful hour which had just come to\r\nan end, and the fair future of which it was the gateway. As for Miss\r\nWodehouse herself, she was in a flutter, and could not get over the\r\nsense of haste and confusion which this last new incident had brought\r\nupon her. Things were going too fast around her, and the timid woman\r\nwas out of breath. Lucy\'s composure at such a moment, and, above all,\r\nthe production of her needlework, was beyond the comprehension of the\r\nelder sister.\r\n\r\n"My dear," said Miss Wodehouse, with an effort, "I don\'t doubt that\r\nthese poor people are badly off, and I am sure it is very good of you\r\nto work for them; but if you will only think how many things there are\r\nto do! My darling, I am afraid you will have to--to make your own\r\ndresses in future, which is what I never thought to see," she said,\r\nputting her handkerchief to her eyes; "and we have not had any talk\r\nabout anything, Lucy, and there are so many things to think of!" Miss\r\nWodehouse, who was moving about the room as she spoke, began to lift\r\nher own books and special property off the centre table. The books\r\nwere principally ancient Annuals in pretty bindings, which no\r\nrepresentation on Lucy\'s part could induce her to think out of date;\r\nand among her other possessions was a little desk in Indian mosaic, of\r\nivory, which had been an institution in the house from Lucy\'s earliest\r\nrecollection. "And these are yours, Lucy dear," said Miss Wodehouse,\r\nstanding up on a chair to take down from the wall two little pictures\r\nwhich hung side by side. They were copies both, and neither of great\r\nvalue; one representing the San Sisto Madonna, and the other a sweet\r\nSt Agnes, whom Lucy had in her earlier days taken to her heart. Lucy\'s\r\nslumbering attention was roused by this sacrilegious act. She gave a\r\nlittle scream, and dropped her work out of her hands.\r\n\r\n"What do I mean?" said Miss Wodehouse; "indeed, Lucy dear, we must\r\nlook it in the face. It is not our drawing-room any longer, you know."\r\nHere she made a pause, and sighed; but somehow a vision of the other\r\ndrawing-room which was awaiting her in the new rectory, made the\r\nprospect less doleful than it might have been. She cleared up in a\r\nsurprising way as she turned to look at her own property on the table.\r\n"My cousin Jack gave me this," said the gentle woman, brushing a\r\nlittle dust off her pretty desk. "When it came first, there was\r\nnothing like it in Carlingford, for that was before Colonel Chiley and\r\nthose other Indian people had settled here. Jack was rather fond of\r\nme in those days, you know, though I never cared for him," the elder\r\nsister continued, with a smile. "Poor fellow! they said he was not\r\nvery happy when he married." Though this was rather a sad fact, Miss\r\nWodehouse announced it not without a certain gentle satisfaction.\r\n"And, Lucy dear, it is our duty to put aside our own things; they were\r\nall presents, you know," she said, standing up on the chair again to\r\nreach down the St Agnes, which, ever since Lucy had been confirmed,\r\nhad hung opposite to her on the wall.\r\n\r\n"Oh, don\'t, don\'t!" cried Lucy. In that little bit of time, not more\r\nthan five minutes as it appeared, the familiar room, which had just\r\nheard the romance of her youth, had come to have a dismantled and\r\ndesolate look. The agent of this destruction, who saw in her mind\'s\r\neye a new scene, altogether surpassing the old, looked complacently\r\nupon her work, and piled the abstracted articles on the top of each\r\nother, with a pleasant sense of property.\r\n\r\n"And your little chair and work-table are yours," said Miss Wodehouse;\r\n"they were always considered yours. You worked the chair yourself,\r\nthough perhaps Miss Gibbons helped you a little; and the table you\r\nknow, was sent home the day you were eighteen. It was--a present, you\r\nremember. Don\'t cry, my darling, don\'t cry; oh, I am sure I did not\r\nmean anything!" cried Miss Wodehouse, putting down the St Agnes and\r\nflying to her sister, about whom she threw her arms. "My hands are all\r\ndusty, dear," said the repentant woman; "but you know, Lucy, we must\r\nlook it in the face, for it is not our drawing-room now. Tom may come\r\nin any day and say--oh, dear, dear, here is some one coming\r\nup-stairs!"\r\n\r\nLucy extricated herself from her sister\'s arms when she heard\r\nfootsteps outside. "If it is anybody who has a right to come, I\r\nsuppose we are able to receive them," she said, and sat erect over her\r\nneedlework, with a changed countenance, not condescending so much as\r\nto look towards the door.\r\n\r\n"But what if it should be Tom? Oh, Lucy dear, don\'t be uncivil to\r\nhim," said the elder sister. Miss Wodehouse even made a furtive\r\nattempt to replace the things, in which she was indignantly stopped by\r\nLucy. "But, my dear, perhaps it is Tom," said the alarmed woman, and\r\nsank trembling into a chair against the St Agnes, which had just been\r\ndeposited there.\r\n\r\n"It does not matter who it is," said Lucy, with dignity. For her own\r\npart, she felt too much aggrieved to mention his name--aggrieved by\r\nher own ignorance, by the deception that had been practised upon her,\r\nby the character of the man whom she was obliged to call her brother,\r\nand chiefly by his existence, which was the principal grievance of\r\nall. Lucy\'s brief life had been embellished, almost ever since she had\r\nbeen capable of independent action, by deeds and thoughts of mercy.\r\nWith her whole heart she was a disciple of Him who came to seek the\r\nlost; notwithstanding, a natural human sentiment in her heart\r\nprotested against the existence of this man, who had brought shame and\r\ndistress into the family without any act of theirs, and who injured\r\neverybody he came in contact with. When the thought of Rosa Elsworthy\r\noccurred to her, a burning blush came upon Lucy\'s cheek--why were such\r\nmen permitted in God\'s world? To be sure, when she came to be aware of\r\nwhat she was thinking, Lucy felt guilty, and called herself a\r\nPharisee, and said a prayer in her heart for the man who had upset all\r\nher cherished ideas of her family and home; but, after all, _that_ was\r\nan after-thought, and did not alter her instinctive sense of repulsion\r\nand indignation. All this swept rapidly through her mind while she sat\r\nawaiting the entrance of the person or persons who were approaching\r\nthe door. "If it is the--owner of the house, it will be best to tell\r\nhim what things you mean to remove," said Lucy; and before Miss\r\nWodehouse could answer, the door was opened. They started, however, to\r\nperceive not Wodehouse, but a personage of very different appearance,\r\nwho came in with an easy air of polite apology, and looked at them\r\nwith eyes which recalled to Lucy the eyes which had been gazing into\r\nher own scarcely an hour ago. "Pardon me," said this unlooked-for\r\nvisitor; "your brother, Miss Wodehouse, finds some difficulty in\r\nexplaining himself to relations from whom he has been separated so\r\nlong. Not to interfere with family privacy, will you let me assist at\r\nthe conference?" said Jack Wentworth. "My brother, I understand, is a\r\nfriend of yours, and your brother--is a--hem--friend of mine," the\r\ndiplomatist added, scarcely able to avoid making a wry face over the\r\nstatement. Wodehouse came in behind, looking an inch or two taller for\r\nthat acknowledgment, and sat down, confronting his sisters, who were\r\nstanding on the defensive. The heir, too, had a strong sense of\r\nproperty, as was natural, and the disarrangement of the room struck\r\nhim in that point of view, especially as Miss Wodehouse continued to\r\nprop herself up against the St Agnes in the back of her chair.\r\nWodehouse looked from the wall to the table, and saw what appeared to\r\nhim a clear case of intended spoliation. "By Jove! they didn\'t mean to\r\ngo empty-handed," said the vagabond, who naturally judged according to\r\nhis own standard, and knew no better. Upon which Lucy, rising with\r\nyouthful state and dignity, took the explanation upon herself.\r\n\r\n"I do not see why we should have the mortification of a spectator,"\r\nsaid Lucy, who already, having been engaged three-quarters of an hour,\r\nfelt deeply disinclined to reveal the weak points of her own family to\r\nthe inspection of the Wentworths. "All that there is to explain can be\r\ndone very simply. Thank you, I will not sit down. Up to this time we\r\nmay be allowed to imagine ourselves in our own--in our father\'s house.\r\nWhat we have to say is simple enough."\r\n\r\n"But pardon me, my dear Miss Wodehouse--" said Jack Wentworth.\r\n\r\n"My sister is Miss Wodehouse," said Lucy. "What there is to settle had\r\nbetter be arranged with our--our brother. If he will tell us precisely\r\nwhen he wishes us to go away, we shall be ready. Mary is going to be\r\nmarried," she went on, turning round so as to face Wodehouse, and\r\naddressing him pointedly, though she did not look at him--to the\r\nexclusion of Jack, who, experienced man as he was, felt disconcerted,\r\nand addressed himself with more precaution to a task which was less easy\r\nthan he supposed.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Lucy!" cried Miss Wodehouse, with a blush worthy of eighteen. It\r\nwas perhaps the first time that the fact had been so broadly stated,\r\nand the sudden announcement made before two men overwhelmed the timid\r\nwoman. Then she was older than Lucy, and had picked up in the course\r\nof her career one or two inevitable scraps of experience, and she\r\ncould not but wonder with a momentary qualm what Mr Proctor might\r\nthink of his brother-in-law. Lucy, who thought Mr Proctor only too\r\nwell off, went on without regarding her sister\'s exclamation.\r\n\r\n"I do not know when the marriage is to be--I don\'t suppose they have\r\nfixed it yet," said Lucy; "but it appears to me that it would save us\r\nall some trouble if we were allowed to remain until that time. I do\r\nnot mean to ask any favour," she said, with a little more sharpness\r\nand less dignity. "We could pay rent for that matter, if--if it were\r\ndesired. She is your sister," said Lucy, suddenly looking Wodehouse in\r\nthe face, "as well as mine. I daresay she has done as much for you as\r\nshe has for me. I don\'t ask any favour for her--but I would cut off my\r\nlittle finger if that would please her," cried the excited young\r\nwoman, with a wildness of illustration so totally out of keeping with\r\nthe matter referred to, that Miss Wodehouse, in the midst of her\r\nemotion, could scarcely restrain a scream of terror; "and you too\r\nmight be willing to do something; you cannot have any kind of feeling\r\nfor me," Lucy continued, recovering herself; "but you might perhaps\r\nhave some feeling for Mary. If we can be permitted to remain until her\r\nmarriage takes place, it may perhaps bring about--a feeling--more\r\nlike--relations; and I shall be able to--"\r\n\r\n"Forgive you," Lucy was about to say, but fortunately stopped herself\r\nin time; for it was the fact of his existence that she had to forgive,\r\nand naturally such an amount of toleration was difficult to explain.\r\nAs for Wodehouse himself, he listened to this appeal with very mingled\r\nfeelings. Some natural admiration and liking woke in his dull mind as\r\nLucy spoke. He was not destitute of good impulses, nor of the ordinary\r\nhuman affections. His little sister was pretty, and a lady, and clever\r\nenough to put Jack Wentworth much more in the background than usual.\r\nHe said, "By Jove" to himself three or four times over in his beard,\r\nand showed a little emotion when she said he could have no feeling for\r\nher. At that point of Lucy\'s address he moved about uneasily in his\r\nchair, and plucked at his beard, and felt himself anything but\r\ncomfortable. "By Jove! I never had a chance," the prodigal said, in\r\nhis undertone. "I might have cared a deal for her if I had had a\r\nchance. She might have done a fellow good, by Jove!" mutterings of\r\nwhich Lucy took no manner of notice, but proceeded with her speech.\r\nWhen she had ended, and it became apparent that an answer was expected\r\nof him, Wodehouse flushed all over with the embarrassment of the\r\nposition. He cleared his throat, he shifted his eyes, which were\r\nembarrassed by Lucy\'s gaze, he pushed his chair from the table, and\r\nmade various attempts to collect himself, but at last ended by a\r\npitiful appeal to Jack Wentworth, who had been looking seriously on.\r\n"You might come to a fellow\'s assistance!" cried Wodehouse. "By Jove!\r\nit was for that you came here."\r\n\r\n"The Miss Wodehouses evidently prefer to communicate with their brother\r\ndirect," said Jack Wentworth, "which is a very natural sentiment. If I\r\ninterfere, it is simply because I have had the advantage of talking the\r\nmatter over, and understanding a little of what you mean. Miss\r\nWodehouse, your brother is not disposed to act the part of a domestic\r\ntyrant. He has come here to offer you the house, which must have so many\r\ntender associations for you, not for a short period, as you wish, but\r\nfor--"\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t know she was going to be married!" exclaimed Wodehouse--"that\r\nmakes all the difference, by Jove! Lucy will marry fast enough; but as\r\nfor Mary, I never thought she would hook any one at her time of life,"\r\nsaid the vagabond, with a rude laugh. He turned to Lucy, not knowing any\r\nbetter, and with some intention of pleasing her; but being met by a look\r\nof indignation under which he faltered, he went back to his natural r\xf4le\r\nof sulky insolence. "By Jove! when I gave in to make such an offer, I\r\nnever thought she had a chance of getting married," said the heir. "I\r\naint going to give what belongs to me to another man--"\r\n\r\n"Your brother wishes," said Jack Wentworth, calmly, "to make over the\r\nhouse and furniture as it stands to you and your sister, Miss Wodehouse.\r\nOf course it is not to be expected that he should be sorry to get his\r\nfather\'s property; but he is sorry that there should be no--no provision\r\nfor you. He means that you should have the house--"\r\n\r\n"But I never thought she was going to be married, by Jove!" protested\r\nthe rightful owner. "Look here, Molly; you shall have the furniture.\r\nThe house would sell for a good bit of money. I tell you, Wentworth--"\r\n\r\nJack Wentworth did not move from the mantlepiece where he was standing,\r\nbut he cast a glance upon his unlucky follower which froze the words on\r\nhis lips. "My good fellow, you are quite at liberty to decline my\r\nmediation in your affairs. Probably you can manage them better your own\r\nway," said Wodehouse\'s hero. "I can only beg the Miss Wodehouses to\r\npardon my intrusion." Jack Wentworth\'s first step towards the door let\r\nloose a flood of nameless terrors upon the soul of his victim. If he\r\nwere abandoned by his powerful protector, what would become of him? His\r\nvery desire of money, and the avarice which prompted him to grudge\r\nmaking any provision for his sisters, was, after all, not real avarice,\r\nbut the spendthrift\'s longing for more to spend. The house which he was\r\nsentenced to give up represented not so much gold and silver, but so\r\nmany pleasures, fine dinners, and bad company. He could order the\r\ndinners by himself, it is true, and get men like himself to eat them;\r\nbut the fine people--the men who had once been fine, and who still\r\nretained a certain tarnished glory--were, so far as Wodehouse was\r\nconcerned, entirely in Jack Wentworth\'s keeping. He made a piteous\r\nappeal to his patron as the great man turned to go away.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see what good it can do _you_ to rob a poor fellow!" cried\r\nWodehouse. "But look here, I aint going to turn against your advice.\r\nI\'ll give it them, by Jove, for life--that is, for Mary\'s life," said\r\nthe munificent brother. "She\'s twenty years older than Lucy--"\r\n\r\n"How do you dare to subject us to such insults?" cried the indignant\r\nLucy, whose little hand clenched involuntarily in her passion. She had\r\na great deal of self-control, but she was not quite equal to such an\r\nemergency; and it was all she could do to keep from stamping her foot,\r\nwhich was the only utterance of rage possible to a gentlewoman in her\r\nposition. "I would rather see my father\'s house desecrated by you\r\nliving in it," she cried, passionately, "than accept it as a gift from\r\nyour hands. Mary, we are not obliged to submit to this. Let us rather\r\ngo away at once. I will not remain in the same room with this man!"\r\ncried Lucy. She was so overwhelmed with her unwonted passion that she\r\nlost all command of the position, and even of herself, and was false\r\nfor the moment to all her sweet codes of womanly behaviour. "How dare\r\nyou, sir!" she cried in the sudden storm for which nobody was prepared.\r\n"We will remove the things belonging to us, with which nobody has any\r\nright to interfere, and we will leave immediately. Mary, come with me!"\r\nWhen she had said this, Lucy swept out of the room, pale as a little\r\nfury, and feeling in her heart a savage female inclination to strike\r\nJack Wentworth, who opened the door for her, with her little white\r\nclenched hand. Too much excited to remark whether her sister had\r\nfollowed her, Lucy ran up-stairs to her room, and there gave way to the\r\ninevitable tears. Coming to herself after that was a terribly humbling\r\nprocess to the little Anglican. She had never fallen into a "passion"\r\nbefore that she knew of, certainly never since nursery times; and often\r\nenough her severe serene girlhood had looked reproving and surprised\r\nupon the tumults of Prickett\'s Lane, awing the belligerents into at\r\nleast temporary silence. Now poor Lucy sat and cried over her downfall;\r\nshe had forgotten herself; she had been conscious of an inclination to\r\nstamp, to scold, even to strike, in the vehemence of her indignation;\r\nand she was utterly overpowered by the thought of her guiltiness.\r\n"The very first temptation!" she said to herself; and made terrible\r\nreflections upon her own want of strength and endurance. To-day, too,\r\nof all days, when God had been so good to her! "If I yield to the first\r\ntemptation like this, how shall I ever endure to the end?" cried Lucy,\r\nand in her heart thought, with a certain longing, of the sacrament of\r\npenance, and tried to think what she could do that would be most\r\ndisagreeable, to the mortifying of the flesh. Perhaps if she had\r\npossessed a more lively sense of humour, another view of the subject\r\nmight have struck Lucy; but humour, fortunately for the unity of human\r\nsentiment, is generally developed at a later period of life, and Lucy\'s\r\nfit of passion only made her think with greater tenderness and\r\ntoleration of her termagants in Prickett\'s Lane.\r\n\r\nThe three who were left down-stairs were in their different ways\r\nimpressed by Lucy\'s passion. Jack Wentworth, being a man of humour and\r\ncultivation, was amused, but respectful, as having still a certain\r\nfaculty of appreciating absolute purity when he saw it. As for\r\nWodehouse, he gave another rude laugh, but was cowed, in spite of\r\nhimself, and felt involuntarily what a shabby wretch he was,\r\nrecognising that fact more impressively from the contempt of Lucy\'s\r\npale face than he could have done through hours of argument. Miss\r\nWodehouse, for her part, though very anxious and nervous, was not\r\nwithout an interest in the question under discussion. _She_ was not\r\nspecially horrified by her brother, or anything he could say or do. He\r\nwas Tom to her--a boy with whom she had once played, and whom she had\r\nshielded with all her sisterly might in his first transgressions. She\r\nhad suffered a great deal more by his means than Lucy could ever\r\nsuffer, and consequently was more tolerant of him. She kept her seat\r\nwith the St Agnes in the chair behind, and watched the course of\r\nevents with anxious steadiness. She did not care for money any more\r\nthan Lucy did; but she could not help thinking it would be very\r\npleasant if she could produce one good action on "poor Tom\'s" part to\r\nplead for him against any possible criticisms of the future. Miss\r\nWodehouse was old enough to know that her Rector was not an ideal\r\nhero, but an ordinary man, and it was quite possible that he might\r\npoint a future moral now and then with "that brother of yours, my\r\ndear." The elder sister waited accordingly, with her heart beating\r\nquick, to know the decision, very anxious that she might have at least\r\none generous deed to record to the advantage of poor Tom.\r\n\r\n"I think we are quite decided on the point," said Jack Wentworth.\r\n"Knowing your sentiments, Wodehouse, I left directions with Waters\r\nabout the papers. I think you will find him to be trusted, Miss\r\nWodehouse, if you wish to consult him about letting or selling--"\r\n\r\n"By Jove!" exclaimed Wodehouse, under his breath.\r\n\r\n"Which, I suppose," continued the superb Jack, "you will wish to do\r\nunder the pleasant circumstances, upon which I beg to offer you my\r\ncongratulations. Now, Tom, my good fellow, I am at your service. I\r\nthink we have done our business here."\r\n\r\nWodehouse got up in his sulky reluctant way like a lazy dog. "I\r\nsuppose you won\'t try to move the furniture now?" he said. These were\r\nthe only adieux he intended to make, and perhaps they might have been\r\nexpressed with still less civility, had not Jack Wentworth been\r\nstanding waiting for him at the door.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Tom! I am so thankful you have done it!" cried Miss Wodehouse.\r\n"It is not that I care for the money; but oh, Tom, I am so glad to\r\nthink nobody can say anything now." She followed them wistfully to the\r\ndoor, not giving up hopes of a kinder parting. "I think it is very\r\nkind and nice of you, and what dear papa would have wished," said the\r\nelder sister, forgetting how all her father\'s plans had been brought\r\nto nothing; "and of course you will live here all the same?" she said,\r\nwith a little eagerness, "that is, till--till--as long as we are\r\nhere--"\r\n\r\n"Good-bye, Miss Wodehouse," said Jack Wentworth. "I don\'t think either\r\nyour brother or I will stay much longer in Carlingford. You must\r\naccept my best wishes for your happiness all the same."\r\n\r\n"You are very kind, I am sure," said the embarrassed bride; "and oh,\r\nTom, you will surely say good-bye? Say good-bye once as if you meant\r\nit; don\'t go away as if you did not care. Tom, I always was very fond\r\nof you; and don\'t you feel a little different to us, now you\'ve done\r\nus a kindness?" cried Miss Wodehouse, going out after him to the\r\nlanding-place. But Wodehouse was in no humour to be gracious. Instead\r\nof paying any attention to her, he looked regretfully at the property\r\nhe had lost.\r\n\r\n"Good-bye," he said, vaguely. "By Jove! I know better than Jack\r\nWentworth does the value of property. We might have had a jolly month at\r\nHomburg out of that old place," said the prodigal, with regret, as he\r\nwent down the old-fashioned oak stair. That was his farewell to the\r\nhouse which he had entered so disastrously on the day of his father\'s\r\nfuneral. He followed his leader with a sulky aspect through the garden,\r\nnot venturing to disobey, but yet feeling the weight of his chains. And\r\nthis was how Wodehouse accomplished his personal share in the gift to\r\nhis sisters, of which Miss Wodehouse told everybody that it was "so good\r\nof Tom!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV.\r\n\r\n\r\n"Going to be married!" said the Squire; "and to a sister of--I thought\r\nyou told me she was as old as Dora, Frank? I did not expect to meet with\r\nany further complications," the old man said, plaintively: "of course\r\nyou know very well I don\'t object to your marrying; but why on earth did\r\nyou let me speak of Wentworth Rectory to Huxtable?" cried Mr Wentworth.\r\nHe was almost more impatient about this new variety in the family\r\ncircumstances than he had been of more serious family distresses. "God\r\nbless me, sir," said the Squire, "what do you mean by it? You take means\r\nto affront your aunts and lose Skelmersdale; and then you put it into my\r\nhead to have Mary at Wentworth; and then you quarrel with the Rector,\r\nand get into hot water in Carlingford; and, to make an end of all, you\r\ncoolly propose to an innocent young woman, and tell me you are going to\r\nmarry--what on earth do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"I am going to marry some time, sir, I hope," said the Perpetual\r\nCurate, with more cheerfulness than he felt; "but not at the present\r\nmoment. Of course we both know that is impossible. I should like you\r\nto come with me and see her before you leave Carlingford. She would\r\nlike it, and so should I."\r\n\r\n"Well, well," said the Squire. Naturally, having been married so often\r\nhimself, he could not refuse a certain response to such a call upon his\r\nsympathy. "I hope you have made a wise choice," said the experienced\r\nfather, not without a sigh; "a great deal depends upon that--not only\r\nyour own comfort, sir, but very often the character of your children and\r\nthe credit of the family. You may laugh," said Mr Wentworth, to whom it\r\nwas no laughing matter; "but long before you are as old as I am, you\r\nwill know the truth of what I say. Your mother, Frank, was a specimen of\r\nwhat a woman ought to be--not to speak of her own children, there was\r\nnobody else who ever knew how to manage Gerald and Jack. Of course I am\r\nnot speaking of Mrs Wentworth, who has her nursery to occupy her," said\r\nthe Squire, apologetically. "I hope you have made a judicious choice."\r\n\r\n"I hope so, too," said Frank, who was somewhat amused by this view of\r\nthe question--"though I am not aware of having exercised any special\r\nchoice in the matter," he added, with a laugh. "However, I want you to\r\ncome with me and see her, and then you will be able to judge for\r\nyourself."\r\n\r\nThe Squire shook his head, and looked as if he had travelled back into\r\nthe heavy roll of family distresses. "I don\'t mean to upbraid you,\r\nFrank," he said--"I daresay you have done what you thought was your\r\nduty--but I think you might have taken a little pains to satisfy\r\nyour aunt Leonora. You see what Gerald has made of it, with all\r\nhis decorations and nonsense. That is a dreadful drawback with you\r\nclergymen. You fix your eyes so on one point that you get to think\r\nthings important that are not in the least important. Could you imagine\r\na man of the world like Jack--he is not what I could wish, but still he\r\nis a man of the world," said the Squire, who was capable of contradicting\r\nhimself with perfect composure without knowing it. "Can you imagine\r\n_him_ risking his prospects for a bit of external decoration? I don\'t\r\nmind it myself," said Mr Wentworth, impartially--"I don\'t pretend to\r\nsee, for my own part, why flowers at Easter should be considered more\r\nsuperstitious than holly at Christmas; but, bless my soul, sir, when\r\nyour aunt thought so, what was the good of running right in her face for\r\nsuch a trifle? I never could understand you parsons," the Squire said,\r\nwith an impatient sigh--"nobody, that I know of, ever considered me\r\nmercenary; but to ruin your own prospects, all for a trumpery bunch of\r\nflowers, and then to come and tell me you want to marry--"\r\n\r\nThis was before luncheon, when Frank and his father were together in\r\nthe dining-room waiting for the other members of the family, who began\r\nto arrive at this moment, and prevented any further discussion. After\r\nall, perhaps, it was a little ungenerous of the Squire to press his\r\nson so hard on the subject of those innocent Easter lilies, long ago\r\nwithered, which certainly, looked at from this distance, did not\r\nappear important enough to sacrifice any prospects for. This was all\r\nthe harder upon the unfortunate Curate, as even at the time his\r\nconviction of their necessity had not proved equal to the satisfactory\r\nsettlement of the question. Miss Wentworth\'s cook was an _artiste_ so\r\nirreproachable that the luncheon provided was in itself perfect; but\r\nnotwithstanding it was an uncomfortable meal. Miss Leonora, in\r\nconsequence of the contest going on in her own mind, was in an\r\nexplosive and highly dangerous condition, not safe to be spoken to;\r\nand as for the Squire, he could not restrain the chance utterances of\r\nhis impatience. Frank, who did his best to make himself agreeable as\r\nmagnanimity required, had the mortification of hearing himself\r\ndiscussed in different tones of disapprobation while he ate his cold\r\nbeef; for Mr Wentworth\'s broken sentences were not long of putting the\r\nparty in possession of the new event, and the Perpetual Curate found\r\nhimself the object of many wondering and pitying glances, in none of\r\nwhich could he read pure sympathy, much less congratulation. Even\r\nGerald looked at him with a little elevation of his eyebrows, as if\r\nwondering how anybody could take the trouble to occupy his mind with\r\nsuch trifling temporal affairs as love and marriage. It was a\r\nwonderful relief to the unfortunate Curate when Miss Leonora had\r\nfinished her glass of madeira, and rose from the table. He had no\r\ninclination to go up-stairs, for his own part. "When you are ready,\r\nsir, you will find me in the garden," he said to his father, who was\r\nto leave Carlingford next morning, and whom he had set his heart on\r\ntaking to see Lucy. But his walk in the garden was far from being\r\ndelightful to Frank. It even occurred to him, for a moment, that it\r\nwould be a very good thing if a man could cut himself adrift from his\r\nrelations at such a crisis of his life. After all, it was his own\r\nbusiness--the act most essentially personal of his entire existence;\r\nand then, with a little softening, he began to think of the girls at\r\nhome--of the little sister, who had a love-story of her own; and of\r\nLetty, who was Frank\'s favourite, and had often confided to him the\r\nenthusiasm she would feel for his bride. "If she is nice," Letty was\r\nin the habit of adding, "and of course she will be nice,"--and at that\r\nthought the heart of the young lover escaped, and put forth its wings,\r\nand went off into that heaven of ideal excellence and beauty, more\r\nsweet, because more vague, than anything real, which stands instead of\r\nthe old working-day skies and clouds at such a period of life. He had\r\nto drop down from a great height, and get rid in all haste of his\r\ncelestial pinions, when he heard his aunt Dora calling him; and his\r\nself-command was not sufficient to conceal, as he obeyed that summons,\r\na certain annoyed expression in his face.\r\n\r\n"Frank," said Miss Dora, coming softly after him with her handkerchief\r\nheld over her head as a defence from the sun--"oh, Frank, I want to\r\nspeak to you. I couldn\'t say anything at lunch because of everybody\r\nbeing there. If you would only stop a moment till I get my breath.\r\nFrank, my dear boy, I wish you joy. I do wish you joy with all my\r\nheart. I should so like just to go and kiss her, and tell her I shall\r\nlove her for your sake."\r\n\r\n"You will soon love her for her own sake," said Frank, to whom even\r\nthis simple-minded sympathy was very grateful; "she is a great deal\r\nbetter than I am."\r\n\r\n"There is just one thing," said Miss Dora. "Oh, Frank, my dear, you\r\nknow I don\'t pretend to be clever, like Leonora, or able to give you\r\nadvice; but there _is_ one thing. You know you have nothing to marry\r\nupon, and all has gone wrong. You are not to have Wentworth, and you\r\nare not to have Skelmersdale, and I think the family is going out of\r\nits senses not to see who is the most worthy. You have got nothing to\r\nlive upon, my dear, dear boy!" said Miss Dora, withdrawing the\r\nhandkerchief from her head in the excitement of the moment to apply it\r\nto her eyes.\r\n\r\n"That is true enough," said the Perpetual Curate; "but then we have\r\nnot made up our minds that we must marry immediately--"\r\n\r\n"Frank," said aunt Dora, with solemnity, breaking into his speech,\r\n"there is just _one_ thing; and I can\'t hold my tongue, though it may\r\nbe very foolish, and they will all say it is my fault." It was a very\r\nquiet summer-day, but still there was a faint rustle in the branches\r\nwhich alarmed the timid woman. She put her hand upon her nephew\'s arm,\r\nand hastened him on to the little summer-house in the wall, which was\r\nher special retirement. "Nobody ever comes here," said Miss Dora;\r\n"they will never think of looking for us here. I am sure I never\r\ninterfere with Leonora\'s arrangements, nor take anything upon myself;\r\nbut there is one thing, Frank--"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said the Curate, "I understand what you mean: you are going to\r\nwarn me about love in a cottage, and how foolish it would be to marry\r\nupon nothing; but, my dear aunt, we are not going to do anything rash;\r\nthere is no such dreadful haste; don\'t be agitated about it," said the\r\nyoung man, with a smile. He was half amused and half irritated by the\r\nearnestness which almost took away the poor lady\'s breath.\r\n\r\n"You _don\'t_ know what I mean," said aunt Dora. "Frank, you know very\r\nwell I never interfere; but I can\'t help being agitated when I see\r\nyou on the brink of such a precipice. Oh, my dear boy, don\'t be\r\nover-persuaded. There _is_ one thing, and I must say it if I should\r\ndie." She had to pause a little to recover her voice, for haste and\r\nexcitement had a tendency to make her inarticulate. "Frank," said\r\nMiss Dora again, more solemnly than ever, "whatever you may be obliged\r\nto do--though you were to write novels, or take pupils, or do\r\ntranslations--oh, Frank, don\'t look at me like that, as if I was going\r\ncrazy. Whatever you may have to do, oh my dear, there is one\r\nthing--don\'t go and break people\'s hearts, and put it off, and put it\r\noff, till it never happens!" cried the trembling little woman, with a\r\nsudden burst of tears. "Don\'t say you can wait, for you can\'t wait, and\r\nyou oughtn\'t to!" sobbed Miss Dora. She subsided altogether into her\r\nhandkerchief and her chair as she uttered this startling and wholly\r\nunexpected piece of advice, and lay there in a little heap, all\r\ndissolving and floating away, overcome with her great effort, while her\r\nnephew stood looking at her from a height of astonishment almost too\r\nextreme for wondering. If the trees could have found a voice and\r\ncounselled his immediate marriage, he could scarcely have been more\r\nsurprised.\r\n\r\n"You think I am losing my senses too," said aunt Dora; "but that is\r\nbecause you don\'t understand me. Oh Frank, my dear boy, there was once\r\na time!--perhaps everybody has forgotten it except me, but I have not\r\nforgotten it. They treated me like a baby, and Leonora had everything\r\nher own way. I don\'t mean to say it was not for the best," said the\r\naggrieved woman. "I know everything is for the best, if we could but\r\nsee it: and perhaps Leonora was right when she said I never could have\r\nstruggled with--with a family, nor lived on a poor man\'s income. My\r\ndear, it was before your uncle Charley died; and when we became rich,\r\nit--didn\'t matter," said Miss Dora; "it was all over before then. Oh\r\nFrank! if I hadn\'t experience I wouldn\'t say a word. I don\'t interfere\r\nabout your opinions, like Leonora. There is just _one_ thing," cried\r\nthe poor lady through her tears. Perhaps it was the recollection of\r\nthe past which overcame Miss Dora, perhaps the force of habit which\r\nhad made it natural for her to cry when she was much moved; but the\r\nfact is certain, that the Squire, when he came to the door of the\r\nsummer-house in search of Frank, found his sister weeping bitterly,\r\nand his son making efforts to console her, in which some sympathy was\r\nmingled with a certain half-amusement. Frank, like Lucy, felt tempted\r\nto laugh at the elderly romance; and yet his heart expanded warmly to\r\nhis tender little foolish aunt, who, after all, might once have been\r\nyoung and in love like himself, though it was so odd to realise it. Mr\r\nWentworth, for his part, saw no humour whatever in the scene. He\r\nthought nothing less than that some fresh complication had taken\r\nplace. Jack had committed some new enormity, or there was bad news\r\nfrom Charley in Malta, or unpleasant letters had come from home.\r\n"Bless my soul, sir, something new has happened," said the Squire; and\r\nhe was scarcely reassured, when Miss Dora stumbled up from her chair in\r\ngreat confusion, and wiped the tears from her eyes. He was suspicious of\r\nthis meeting in the summer-house, which seemed a quite unnecessary\r\nproceeding to Mr Wentworth; and though he flattered himself he\r\nunderstood women, he could not give any reasonable explanation to\r\nhimself of Dora\'s tears.\r\n\r\n"It is nothing--nothing at all," said Miss Dora: "it was not Frank\'s\r\ndoing in the least; he is always so considerate, and such a dear\r\nfellow. Thank you, my dear boy; my head is a little better; I think I\r\nwill go in and lie down," said the unlucky aunt. "You are not to mind\r\nme now, for I have quite got over my little attack; I always was so\r\nnervous," said Miss Dora; "and I sometimes wonder whether it isn\'t the\r\nWentworth complaint coming on," she added, with a natural female\r\nartifice which was not without its effect.\r\n\r\n"I wish you would not talk nonsense," said the Squire. "The Wentworth\r\ncomplaint is nothing to laugh at, but you are perfectly aware that it\r\nnever attacks women." Mr Wentworth spoke with a little natural\r\nirritation, displeased to have his prerogative interfered with. When a\r\nman has all the suffering attendant upon a special complaint, it is\r\nhard not to have all the dignity. He felt so much and so justly\r\nannoyed by Miss Dora\'s vain pretensions, that he forgot his anxiety\r\nabout the secret conference in the summer-house. "Women take such\r\nfantastic ideas into their heads," he said to his son as they went\r\naway together. "Your aunt Dora is the kindest soul in the world; but\r\nnow and then, sir, she is very absurd," said the Squire. He could not\r\nget this presumptuous notion out of his head, but returned to it again\r\nand again, even after they had got into Grange Lane. "It has been in\r\nour family for two hundred years," said Mr Wentworth; "and I don\'t\r\nthink there is a single instance of its attacking a woman--not even\r\nslightly, sir," the Squire added, with irritation, as if Frank had\r\ntaken the part of the female members of the family, which indeed the\r\nCurate had no thought of doing.\r\n\r\nMiss Dora, for her part, having made this very successful diversion,\r\nescaped to the house, and to her own room, where she indulged in a\r\nheadache all the afternoon, and certain tender recollections which\r\nwere a wonderful resource at all times to the soft-hearted woman. "Oh,\r\nmy dear boy, don\'t be over-persuaded," she had whispered into Frank\'s\r\near as she left him; and her remonstrance, simple as it was, had no\r\ndoubt produced a considerable effect upon the mind of the Perpetual\r\nCurate. He could not help thinking, as they emerged into the road,\r\nthat it was chiefly the impatient and undutiful who secured their\r\nhappiness. Those who were constant and patient, and able to deny\r\nthemselves, instead of being rewarded for their higher qualities,\r\nwere, on the contrary, put to the full test of the strength that was\r\nin them; while those who would not wait attained what they wanted, and\r\non the whole, as to other matters, got on just as well as their\r\nstronger-minded neighbours. This germ of thought, it may be supposed,\r\nwas stimulated into very warm life by the reflection that Lucy would\r\nhave to leave Carlingford with her sister, without any definite\r\nprospect of returning again; and a certain flush of impatience came\r\nover the young man, not unnatural in the circumstances. It seemed to\r\nhim that everybody else took their own way without waiting; and why\r\nshould it be so certain that he alone, whose "way" implied harm to no\r\none, should be the only man condemned to wait? Thus it will be seen\r\nthat the "just one thing" insisted on by Miss Dora was far from being\r\nwithout effect on the mind of her nephew; upon whom, indeed, the\r\nevents of the morning had wrought various changes of sentiment. When\r\nhe walked up Grange Lane for the first time, it had been without any\r\nacknowledged intention of opening his mind to Lucy, and yet he had\r\nreturned along the same prosaic and unsympathetic line of road her\r\naccepted lover; her accepted lover, triumphant in that fact, but\r\nwithout the least opening of any hope before him as to the conclusion\r\nof the engagement, which prudence had no hand in making. Now the\r\nfootsteps of the Perpetual Curate fell firmly, not to say a little\r\nimpatiently, upon the road over which he had carried so many varying\r\nthoughts. He was as penniless as ever, and as prospectless; but in the\r\ntossings of his natural impatience the young man had felt the reins\r\nhang loosely about his head, and knew that he was no more restrained\r\nthan other men, but might, if he chose it, have his way like the rest\r\nof the world. It was true enough that he might have to pay for it\r\nafter, as other people had done; but in the mean time the sense that\r\nhe was his own master was sweet, and to have his will for once seemed\r\nno more than his right in the world. While these rebellious thoughts\r\nwere going on in the Curate\'s mind, his father, who suspected nothing,\r\nwent steadily by his side, not without a little reluctance at the\r\nthought of the errand on which he was bound. "But they can\'t marry for\r\nyears, and nobody can tell what may happen in that time," Mr Wentworth\r\nsaid to himself, with the callousness of mature age, not suspecting\r\nthe different ideas that were afloat in the mind of his son. Perhaps,\r\non the whole, he was not sorry that Skelmersdale was destined\r\notherwise, and that Huxtable had been spoken to about Wentworth\r\nRectory; for, of course, Frank would have plunged into marriage at\r\nonce if he had been possessed of anything to marry on; and it looked\r\nprovidential under the circumstances, as the Squire argued with\r\nhimself privately, that at such a crisis the Perpetual Curate should\r\nhave fallen between two stools of possible preferment, and should\r\nstill be obliged to content himself with St Roque\'s. It was hard for\r\nMr Wentworth to reconcile himself to the idea that the wife of his\r\nfavourite son should be the sister of--; for the Squire forgot that\r\nhis own girls were Jack Wentworth\'s sisters, and as such might be\r\nobjected to in their turn by some other father. So the two gentlemen\r\nwent to see Lucy, who was then in a very humble frame of mind, just\r\nrecovered from her passion--one of them rather congratulating himself\r\non the obstacles which lay before the young couple, the other tossing\r\nhis youthful head a little in the first impulses of self-will, feeling\r\nthe reins lie loose upon him, and making up his mind to have his own\r\nway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile Mr Frank Wentworth\'s affairs were thus gathering to a crisis,\r\nother events likely to influence his fate were also taking place in\r\nCarlingford. Breakfast had been served a full half-hour later than\r\nusual in the Rectory, which had not improved the temper of the\r\nhousehold. Everything was going on with the most wonderful quietness\r\nin that well-arranged house; but it was a quietness which would have\r\nmade a sensitive visitor uncomfortable, and which woke horrible\r\nprivate qualms in the mind of the Rector. As for Mrs Morgan, she\r\nfulfilled all her duties with a precision which was terrible to\r\nbehold: instead of taking part in the conversation as usual, and\r\nhaving her own opinion, she had suddenly become possessed of such a\r\nspirit of meekness and acquiescence as filled her husband with dismay.\r\nThe Rector was fond of his wife, and proud of her good sense, and her\r\njudgment, and powers of conversation. If she had been angry and found\r\nfault with him, he might have understood that mode of procedure; but\r\nas she was not angry, but only silent, the excellent man was terribly\r\ndisconcerted, and could not tell what to do. He had done all he could\r\nto be conciliatory, and had already entered upon a great many\r\nexplanations which had come to nothing for want of any response; and\r\nnow she sat at the head of the table making tea with an imperturbable\r\ncountenance, sometimes making little observations about the news,\r\nperfectly calm and dignified, but taking no part in anything more\r\ninteresting, and turning off any reference that was made to her in the\r\nmost skilful manner. "Mr Morgan knows I never take any part in the\r\ngossip of Carlingford," she said to Mr Proctor, without any intention\r\nof wounding that good man; and he who had been in the midst of\r\nsomething about Mr Wentworth came to an abrupt stop with the sense of\r\nhaving shown himself as a gossip, which was very injurious to his\r\ndignity. The late Rector, indeed, occupied a very uncomfortable\r\nposition between the married people thus engaged in the absorbing\r\nexcitement of their first quarrel. The quiet little arrows, which Mrs\r\nMorgan intended only for her husband, grazed and stung him as they\r\npassed, without missing at the same time their intended aim; and he\r\nwas the auditor, besides, of a great deal of information intended by\r\nthe Rector for his wife\'s benefit, to which Mrs Morgan paid no manner\r\nof attention. Mr Proctor was not a man of very lively observation, but\r\nhe could not quite shut his eyes to the position of affairs; and the\r\nnatural effect upon his mind, in the circumstances, was to turn his\r\nthoughts towards his mild Mary, whom he did not quite recognise as yet\r\nunder her Christian name. He called her Miss Wodehouse in his heart\r\neven while in the act of making comparisons very unfavourable to the\r\nRector\'s wife, and then he introduced benevolently the subject of his\r\nnew rectory, which surely must be safe ground.\r\n\r\n"It is a pretty little place," Mr Proctor said, with satisfaction: "of\r\ncourse it is but a small living compared to Carlingford. I hope you\r\nwill come and see me, after--it is furnished," said the bashful\r\nbridegroom: "it is a nuisance to have all that to look after for one\'s\r\nself--"\r\n\r\n"I hope you will have somebody to help you," said Mrs Morgan, with a\r\nlittle earnestness; "gentlemen don\'t understand about such things.\r\nWhen you have one piece of furniture in bad taste, it spoils a whole\r\nroom--carpets, for instance--" said the Rector\'s wife. She looked at\r\nMr Proctor so severely that the good man faltered, though he was not\r\naware of the full extent of his guiltiness.\r\n\r\n"I am sure I don\'t know," he said: "I told the man here to provide\r\neverything as it ought to be; and I think we were very successful,"\r\ncontinued Mr Proctor, with a little complacency: to be sure, they were\r\nin the dining-room at the moment, being still at the breakfast-table.\r\n"Buller knows a great deal about that sort of thing, but then he is too\r\necclesiological for my taste. I like things to look cheerful," said the\r\nunsuspicious man. "Buller is the only man that could be reckoned on if\r\nany living were to fall vacant. It is very odd nowadays how indifferent\r\nmen are about the Church. I don\'t say that it is not very pleasant at\r\nAll-Souls; but a house of one\'s own, you know--" said Mr Proctor,\r\nlooking with a little awkward enthusiasm at his recently-married\r\nbrother; "of course I mean a sphere--a career--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, ah, yes," said Mr Morgan, with momentary gruffness; "but\r\neverything has its drawbacks. I don\'t think Buller would take a\r\nliving. He knows too well what\'s comfortable," said the suffering man.\r\n"The next living that falls will have to go to some one out of the\r\ncollege," said Mr Morgan. He spoke with a tone of importance and\r\nsignificance which moved Mr Proctor, though he was not rapid in his\r\nperceptions, to look across at him for further information.\r\n\r\n"Most people have some crotchet or other," said the Rector. "When a\r\nman\'s views are clear about subscription, and that sort of thing, he\r\ngenerally goes as far wrong the other way. Buller might go out to\r\nCentral Africa, perhaps, if there was a bishopric of Wahuma--or what\r\nis the name, my dear, in that Nile book?"\r\n\r\n"I have not read it," said Mrs Morgan, and she made no further remark.\r\n\r\nThus discouraged in his little attempt at amity, the Rector resumed\r\nafter a moment, "Wentworth\'s brother has sent in his resignation to\r\nhis bishop. There is no doubt about it any longer. I thought that\r\ndelusion had been over, at all events; and I suppose now Wentworth\r\nwill be provided for," said Mr Morgan, not without a little anxiety.\r\n\r\n"No; they are all equally crotchety, I think," said Mr Proctor. "I\r\nknow about them, through my--my connection with the Wodehouses, you\r\nknow. I should not wonder, for my own part, if he went after his\r\nbrother, who is a very intelligent man, though mistaken," the late\r\nRector added, with respect. "As for Frank Wentworth, he is a little\r\nhot-headed. I had a long conversation the other night with the elder\r\nbrother. I tried to draw him out about Burgon\'s book, but he declined\r\nto enter into the question. Frank has made up his mind to stay in\r\nCarlingford. I understand he thinks it right on account of his\r\ncharacter being called in question here; though, of course, no one in\r\nhis senses could have had any doubt how _that_ would turn out," said\r\nMr Proctor, forgetting that he himself had been very doubtful about\r\nthe Curate. "From what I hear, they are all very crotchety," he\r\ncontinued, and finished his breakfast calmly, as if that settled the\r\nquestion. As for Mrs Morgan, even this interesting statement had no\r\neffect upon her. She looked up suddenly at one moment as if intending\r\nto dart a reproachful glance at her husband, but bethought herself in\r\ntime, and remained passive as before; not the less, however, was she\r\nmoved by what she had just heard. It was not Mr Wentworth she was\r\nthinking of, except in a very secondary degree. What occupied her, and\r\nmade her reflections bitter, was the thought that her husband--the man\r\nto whom she had been faithful for ten weary years--had taken himself\r\ndown off the pedestal on which she had placed him. "To make idols, and\r\nto find them clay," she said plaintively in her own mind. Women were\r\nall fools to spend their time and strength in constructing such\r\npedestals, Mrs Morgan thought to herself with bitterness; and as to\r\nthe men who were so perpetually dethroning themselves, how were they\r\nto be designated? To think of her William, of whom she had once made a\r\nhero, ruining thus, for a little petty malice and rivalry, the\r\nprospects of another man! While these painful reflections were going\r\nthrough her mind, she was putting away her tea-caddy, and preparing to\r\nleave the gentlemen to their own affairs. "We shall see you at dinner\r\nat six," she said, with a constrained little smile, to Mr Proctor, and\r\nwent up-stairs with her key-basket in her hand without taking any\r\nspecial notice of the Rector. Mr Leeson was to come to dinner that day\r\nlegitimately by invitation, and Mrs Morgan, who felt it would be a\r\nlittle consolation to disappoint the hungry Curate for once, was\r\nmaking up her mind, as she went up-stairs, not to have the All-Souls\r\npudding, of which he showed so high an appreciation. It almost seemed\r\nto her as if this spark of ill-nature was receiving a summary\r\nchastisement, when she heard steps ascending behind her. Mrs Morgan\r\nobjected to have men lounging about her drawing-room in the morning.\r\nShe thought Mr Proctor was coming to bestow a little more of his\r\nconfidence upon her, and perhaps to consult her about his furnishing;\r\nand being occupied by her own troubles, she had no patience for a\r\ntiresome, middle-aged lover, who no doubt was going to disappoint and\r\ndisenchant another woman. She sat down, accordingly, with a sigh of\r\nimpatience at her work-table, turning her back to the door. Perhaps,\r\nwhen he saw her inhospitable attitude, he might go away and not bother\r\nher. And Mrs Morgan took out some stockings to darn, as being a\r\ndiscontented occupation, and was considering within herself what\r\nsimple preparation she could have instead of the All-Souls pudding,\r\nwhen, looking up suddenly, she saw, not Mr Proctor, but the Rector,\r\nstanding looking down upon her within a few steps of her chair. When\r\nshe perceived him, it was not in nature to refrain from certain\r\nsymptoms of agitation. The thoughts she had been indulging in brought\r\nsuddenly a rush of guilty colour to her face; but she commanded\r\nherself as well as she could, and went on darning her stockings, with\r\nher heart beating very loud in her breast.\r\n\r\n"My dear," said the Rector, taking a seat near her, "I don\'t know what\r\nit is that has risen between us. We look as if we had quarrelled; and\r\nI thought we had made up our minds never to quarrel." The words were\r\nrather soft in their signification, but Mr Morgan could not help\r\nspeaking severely, as was natural to his voice; which was perhaps, in\r\nthe present case, all the better for his wife.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what you may consider quarrelling, William," said Mrs\r\nMorgan, "but I am sure I have never made any complaint."\r\n\r\n"No," said the Rector; "I have seen women do that before. You don\'t\r\nmake any complaint, but you look as if you disapproved of everything.\r\nI feel it all the more just now because I want to consult you; and,\r\nafter all, the occasion was no such--"\r\n\r\n"I never said there was any occasion. I am sure I never made any\r\ncomplaint. You said you wanted to consult me, William?" Mrs Morgan\r\nwent on darning her stockings while she was speaking, and the Rector,\r\nlike most other men, objected to be spoken to by the lips only. He\r\nwould have liked to toss the stocking out of the window, though it\r\nwas his own, and the task of repairing it was one of a devoted wife\'s\r\nfirst duties, according to the code of female proprieties in which\r\nboth the husband and wife had been brought up.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said the Rector, with a sigh. "The truth is, I have just got a\r\nletter from Harry Scarsfield, who was my pet pupil long ago. He tells\r\nme my father\'s old rectory is vacant, where we were all brought up.\r\nThere used to be a constant intercourse between the Hall and the Rectory\r\nwhen I was a lad. They are very nice people the Scarsfields--at least\r\nthey used to be very nice people; and Harry has his mother living with\r\nhim, and the family has never been broken up, I believe. We used to\r\nknow everybody about there," said Mr Morgan, abandoning himself to\r\nrecollections in a manner most mysterious to his wife. "There is the\r\nletter, my dear," and he put it down upon her table, and began to play\r\nwith the reels of cotton in her workbox unconsciously, as he had not\r\ndone for a long time; which, unawares to herself, had a softening\r\ninfluence upon Mrs Morgan\'s heart.\r\n\r\n"I do not know anything about the Scarsfields," she said, without\r\ntaking up the letter, "and I cannot see what you have to do with this.\r\nDoes he wish you to recommend some one?" Mrs Morgan added, with a\r\nmomentary interest; for she had, of course, like other people, a\r\nrelation in a poor living, whom it would have been satisfactory to\r\nrecommend.\r\n\r\n"He says I may have it if I have a mind," said the Rector curtly,\r\nbetraying a little aggravation in his tone.\r\n\r\n"You, William?" said Mrs Morgan. She was so much surprised that she laid\r\ndown her stocking and looked him straight in the face, which she had not\r\ndone for many days; and it was wonderful how hard she found it to keep up\r\nher reserve, after having once looked her husband in the eyes. "But it is\r\nnot much more than six months since you were settled in Carlingford,"\r\nshe said, still lost in amazement. "You cannot possibly mean to make a\r\nchange so soon? and then the difference of the position," said the\r\nRector\'s wife. As she looked at him, she became more and more aware of\r\nsome meaning in his face which she did not understand; and more and more,\r\nas it became necessary to understand him, the reserves and self-defences\r\nof the first quarrel gave way and dispersed. "I don\'t think I quite know\r\nwhat you mean," she said, faltering a little. "I don\'t understand why\r\nyou should think of a change."\r\n\r\n"A good country living is a very good position," said the Rector; "it is\r\nnot nearly so troublesome as a town like Carlingford. There is no\r\nDissent that I know of, and no--" (here Mr Morgan paused for a moment,\r\nnot knowing what word to use)--"no disturbing influences: of course I\r\nwould not take such a step without your concurrence, my dear," the\r\nRector continued; and then there followed a bewildering pause. Mrs\r\nMorgan\'s first sensation after the astonishment with which she heard\r\nthis strange proposal was mortification--the vivid shame and vexation of\r\na woman when she is obliged to own to herself that her husband has been\r\nworsted, and is retiring from the field.\r\n\r\n"If you think it right--if you think it best--of course I can have\r\nnothing to say," said the Rector\'s wife; and she took up her stocking\r\nwith a stinging sense of discomfiture. She had meant that her husband\r\nshould be the first man in Carlingford--that he should gain everybody\'s\r\nrespect and veneration, and become the ideal parish-priest of that\r\nfavourite and fortunate place. Every kind of good work and benevolent\r\nundertaking was to be connected with his name, according to the visions\r\nwhich Mrs Morgan had framed when she came first to Carlingford, not\r\nwithout such a participation on her own part as should entitle her to\r\nthe milder glory appertaining to the good Rector\'s wife. All these hopes\r\nwere now to be blotted out ignominiously. Defeat and retreat and failure\r\nwere to be the conclusion of their first essay at life. "You are the\r\nbest judge of what you ought to do," she said, with as much calmness as\r\nshe could muster, but she could have dropped bitter tears upon the\r\nstocking she was mending if that would have done any good.\r\n\r\n"I will do nothing without your consent," said the Rector. "Young\r\nWentworth is going to stay in Carlingford. You need not look up so\r\nsharply, as if you were vexed to think _that_ had anything to do with\r\nit. If he had not behaved like a fool, I never could have been led\r\ninto such a mistake," said Mr Morgan, with indignation, taking a\r\nlittle walk to the other end of the room to refresh himself. "At the\r\nsame time," said the Rector, severely, coming back after a pause, "to\r\nshow any ill-feeling would be very unchristian either on your side or\r\nmine. If I were to accept Harry Scarsfield\'s offer, Proctor and I\r\nwould do all we could to have young Wentworth appointed to\r\nCarlingford. There is nobody just now at All-Souls to take the living;\r\nand however much you may disapprove of him, my dear," said Mr Morgan,\r\nwith increasing severity, "there is nothing that I know to be said\r\nagainst him as a clergyman. If you can make up your mind to consent to\r\nit, and can see affairs in the same light as they appear to me, that\r\nis what I intend to do--"\r\n\r\nMrs Morgan\'s stocking had dropped on her knees as she listened; then it\r\ndropped on the floor, and she took no notice of it. When the Rector had\r\nfinally delivered himself of his sentiments, which he did in the voice\r\nof a judge who was condemning some unfortunate to the utmost penalties\r\nof the law, his wife marked the conclusion of the sentence by a sob of\r\nstrange excitement. She kept gazing at him for a few moments without\r\nfeeling able to speak, and then she put down her face into her hands.\r\nWords were too feeble to give utterance to her feelings at such a\r\nsupreme moment. "Oh, William, I wonder if you can ever forgive me,"\r\nsobbed the Rector\'s wife, with a depth of compunction which he, good\r\nman, was totally unprepared to meet, and knew no occasion for. He was\r\neven at the moment a little puzzled to have such a despairing petition\r\naddressed to him. "I hope so, my dear," he said, very sedately, as he\r\ncame and sat down beside her, and could not refrain from uttering a\r\nlittle lecture upon temper, which fortunately Mrs Morgan was too much\r\nexcited to pay any attention to. "It would be a great deal better if you\r\ndid not give way to your feelings," said the Rector; "but in the mean\r\ntime, my dear, it is your advice I want, for we must not take such a\r\nstep unadvisedly," and he lifted up the stocking that had fallen, and\r\ncontemplated, not without surprise, the emotion of his wife. The\r\nexcellent man was as entirely unconscious that he was being put up again\r\nat that moment with acclamations upon his pedestal, as that he had at a\r\nformer time been violently displaced from it, and thrown into the\r\ncategory of broken idols. All this would have been as Sanscrit to the\r\nRector of Carlingford; and the only resource he had was to make in his\r\nown mind certain half-pitying, half-affectionate remarks upon the\r\ninexplicable weakness of women, and to pick up the stocking which his\r\nwife was darning, and finally to stroke her hair, which was still as\r\npretty and soft and brown as it had been ten years ago. Under such\r\ncircumstances a man does not object to feel himself on a platform of\r\nmoral superiority. He even began to pet her a little, with a pleasant\r\nsense of forgiveness and forbearance. "You were perhaps a little cross,\r\nmy love, but you don\'t think I am the man to be hard upon you," said the\r\nRector. "Now you must dry your eyes and give me your advice--you know\r\nhow much confidence I have always had in your advice--"\r\n\r\n"Forgive me, William. I don\'t think there is any one so good as you are;\r\nand as long as we are together it does not matter to me where we are,"\r\nsaid the repentant woman. But as she lifted up her head, her eye fell on\r\nthe carpet, and a gleam of sudden delight passed through Mrs Morgan\'s\r\nmind. To be delivered from all her suspicions and injurious thoughts\r\nabout her husband would have been a deliverance great enough for one\r\nday; but at the same happy moment to see a means of deliverance from the\r\nsmaller as well as the greater cross of her existence seemed almost too\r\ngood to be credible. She brightened up immediately when that thought\r\noccurred to her. "I think it is the very best thing you could do," she\r\nsaid. "We are both so fond of the country, and it is so much nicer to\r\nmanage a country parish than a town one. We might have lived all our\r\nlives in Carlingford without knowing above half of the poor people,"\r\nsaid Mrs Morgan, growing in warmth as she went on; "it is so different\r\nin a country parish. I never liked to say anything," she continued, with\r\nsubtle feminine policy, "but I never--much--cared for Carlingford." She\r\ngave a sigh as she spoke, for she thought of the Virginian creeper and\r\nthe five feet of new wall at that side of the garden, which had just\r\nbeen completed, to shut out the view of the train. Life does not contain\r\nany perfect pleasure. But when Mrs Morgan stooped to lift up some stray\r\nreels of cotton which the Rector\'s clumsy fingers had dropped out of her\r\nworkbox, her eye was again attracted by the gigantic roses and tulips on\r\nthe carpet, and content and satisfaction filled her heart.\r\n\r\n"I have felt the same thing, my dear," said Mr Morgan. "I don\'t say\r\nanything against Mr Finial as an architect, but Scott himself could make\r\nnothing of such a hideous church. I don\'t suppose Wentworth will mind,"\r\nsaid the Rector, with a curious sense of superiority. He felt his own\r\nmagnanimous conduct at the moment almost as much as his wife had done,\r\nand could not help regarding Carlingford Church as the gift-horse which\r\nwas not to be examined too closely in the mouth.\r\n\r\n"No," said Mrs Morgan, not without a passing sensation of doubt on\r\nthis point; "if he had only been frank and explained everything, there\r\nnever could have been any mistake; but I am glad it has all happened,"\r\nsaid the Rector\'s wife, with a little enthusiasm. "Oh, William, I have\r\nbeen such a wretch--I have been thinking--but now you are heaping\r\ncoals of fire on his head," she cried, with a hysterical sound in her\r\nthroat. It was no matter to her that she herself scarcely knew what\r\nshe meant, and that the good Rector had not the faintest understanding\r\nof it. She was so glad, that it was almost necessary to be guilty of\r\nsome extravagance by way of relieving her mind. "After all Mr Proctor\'s\r\ncare in fitting the furniture, you would not, of course, think of\r\nremoving it," said Mrs Morgan; "Mr Wentworth will take it as we did; and\r\nas for Mrs Scarsfield, if you like her, William, you may be sure I\r\nshall," the penitent wife said softly, in the flutter and tremor of her\r\nagitation. As he saw himself reflected in her eyes, the Rector could not\r\nbut feel himself a superior person, elevated over other men\'s shoulders.\r\nSuch a sense of goodness promotes the amiability from which it springs.\r\nThe Rector kissed his wife as he got up from his seat beside her, and\r\nonce more smoothed down, with a touch which made her feel like a girl\r\nagain, her pretty brown hair.\r\n\r\n"That is all settled satisfactorily," said Mr Morgan, "and now I must\r\ngo to my work again. I thought, if you approved of it, I would write\r\nat once to Scarsfield, and also to Buller of All-Souls."\r\n\r\n"Do," said the Rector\'s wife--and she too bestowed, in her middle-aged\r\nway, a little caress, which was far from being unpleasant to the\r\nsober-minded man. He went down-stairs in a more agreeable frame of\r\nmind than he had known for a long time back. Not that he understood\r\nwhy she had cried about it when he laid his intentions before her. Had\r\nMr Morgan been a Frenchman, he probably would have imagined his wife\'s\r\nheart to be touched by the graces of the Perpetual Curate; but, being\r\nan Englishman, and rather more certain, on the whole, of her than of\r\nhimself, it did not occur to him to speculate on the subject. He was\r\nquite able to content himself with the thought that women were\r\nincomprehensible, as he went back to his study. To be sure, it was\r\nbest to understand them, if you could; but if not, it did not so very\r\nmuch matter, Mr Morgan thought; could in this pleasant condition of\r\nmind he went down-stairs and wrote a little sermon, which ever after\r\nwas a great favourite, preached upon all special occasions, and always\r\nlistened to with satisfaction, especially by the Rector\'s wife.\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs Morgan was left alone she sat doing nothing for an entire\r\nhalf-hour, thinking of the strange and unhoped-for change that in a\r\nmoment had occurred to her. Though she was not young, she had that\r\nsense of grievousness, the unbearableness of trouble, which belongs to\r\nyouth; for, after all, whatever female moralists may say on the\r\nsubject, the patience of an unmarried woman wearing out her youth in\r\nthe harassments of a long engagement, is something very different from\r\nthe hard and many-sided experience of actual life. She had been\r\naccustomed for years to think that her troubles would be over when the\r\nlong-expected event arrived; and when new and more vexatious troubles\r\nstill sprang up after that event, the woman of one idea was not much\r\nbetter fitted to meet them than if she had been a girl. Now that the\r\nmomentary cloud had been driven off, Mrs Morgan\'s heart rose more\r\nwarmly than ever. She changed her mind in a moment about the All-Souls\r\npudding, and even added, in her imagination, another dish to the\r\ndinner, without pausing to think that _that_ also was much approved by\r\nMr Leeson; and then her thoughts took another turn, and such a vision\r\nof a perfect carpet for a drawing-room--something softer and more\r\nexquisite than ever came out of mortal loom; full of repose and\r\ntranquillity, yet not without seducing beauties of design; a carpet\r\nwhich would never obtrude itself, but yet would catch the eye by\r\ndreamy moments in the summer twilight or over the winter fire--flashed\r\nupon the imagination of the Rector\'s wife. It would be sweet to have a\r\nhouse of one\'s own arranging, where everything would be in harmony;\r\nand though this sweetness was very secondary to the other satisfaction\r\nof having a husband who was not a clay idol, but really deserved his\r\npedestal, it yet supplemented the larger delight, and rounded off all\r\nthe corners of Mrs Morgan\'s present desires. She wished everybody as\r\nhappy as herself, in the effusion of the moment, and thought of Lucy\r\nWodehouse, with a little glow of friendliness in which there was still\r\na tincture of admiring envy. All this that happy girl would have\r\nwithout the necessity of waiting for it; but then was it not the\r\nRector, the rehabilitated husband, who would be the means of producing\r\nso much happiness? Mrs Morgan rose up as lightly as a girl when she\r\nhad reached this stage, and opened her writing-desk, which was one of\r\nher wedding-presents, and too fine to be used on common occasions. She\r\ntook out her prettiest paper, with her monogram in violet, which was\r\nher favourite colour. One of those kind impulses which are born of\r\nhappiness moved her relieved spirit. To give to another the\r\nconsolation of a brighter hope, seemed at the moment the most natural\r\nway of expressing her own thankful feelings. Instead of going\r\ndown-stairs immediately to order dinner, she sat down instead at the\r\ntable, and wrote the following note:--\r\n\r\n\r\n "MY DEAR MR WENTWORTH,--I don\'t know whether you will think me a\r\n fair-weather friend seeking you only when everybody else is seeking\r\n you, and when you are no longer in want of support and sympathy.\r\n Perhaps you will exculpate me when you remember the last conversation\r\n we had; but what I write for at present is to ask if you would waive\r\n ceremony and come to dinner with us to-night. I am aware that your\r\n family are still in Carlingford, and of course I don\'t know what\r\n engagements you may have; but if you are at liberty, pray come. If Mr\r\n Morgan and you had but known each other a little better things could\r\n never have happened which have been a great grief and vexation to me;\r\n and I know the Rector _wishes very much_ to have a little conversation\r\n with you, and has something to speak of in which you would be\r\n interested. Perhaps my husband might feel a little strange in asking\r\n you to overstep the barrier which somehow has been raised between you\r\n two; but I am sure if you knew each other better you would understand\r\n each other, and this is one of the things we women ought to be good\r\n for. I will take it as a proof that you consider me a friend if you\r\n accept my invitation. Our hour is half-past six.--Believe me, very\r\n sincerely, yours,\r\n\r\n "M. MORGAN."\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen she had written this note Mrs Morgan went down-stairs, stopping\r\nat the library door in passing. "I thought I might as well ask Mr\r\nWentworth to come to us to-night, as we are to have some people to\r\ndinner," she said, looking in at the door. "I thought you might like\r\nto talk to him, William; and if his people are going away to-day, I\r\ndaresay he will feel rather lonely to-night." Such was the Jesuitical\r\naspect in which she represented the flag of truce she was sending. Mr\r\nMorgan was a little startled by action so prompt.\r\n\r\n"I should like to hear from Buller first," said the Rector; "he might\r\nlike to come to Carlingford himself, for anything I can tell; but, to\r\nbe sure, it can do no harm to have Wentworth to dinner," said Mr\r\nMorgan, doubtfully; "only Buller, you know, might wish--and in that\r\ncase it might not be worth our trouble to make any change."\r\n\r\nIn spite of herself, Mrs Morgan\'s countenance fell; her pretty scheme\r\nof poetic justice, her vision of tasteful and appropriate furniture,\r\nbecame obscured by a momentary mist. "At least it is only right to ask\r\nhim to dinner," she said, in subdued tones, and went to speak to the\r\ncook in a frame of mind more like the common level of human\r\nsatisfaction than the exultant and exalted strain to which she had\r\nrisen at the first moment. Then she put on a black dress, and went to\r\ncall on the Miss Wodehouses, who naturally came into her mind when she\r\nthought of the Perpetual Curate. As she went along Grange Lane she\r\ncould not but observe a hackney cab, one of those which belong to the\r\nrailway station, lounging--if a cab could ever be said to lounge--in\r\nthe direction of Wharfside. Its appearance specially attracted Mrs\r\nMorgan\'s attention in consequence of the apparition of Elsworthy\'s\r\nfavourite errand-boy, who now and then poked his head furtively\r\nthrough the window, and seemed to be sitting in state inside. When she\r\nhad gone a little further she encountered Wodehouse and Jack\r\nWentworth, who had just come from paying their visit to the sisters.\r\nThe sight of these two revived her sympathies for the lonely women who\r\nhad fallen so unexpectedly out of wealth into poverty; but yet she\r\nfelt a little difficulty in framing her countenance to be partly\r\nsorrowful and partly congratulatory, as was necessary under these\r\ncircumstances; for though she knew nothing of the accident which had\r\nhappened that morning, when Lucy and the Perpetual Curate saw each\r\nother alone, she was aware of Miss Wodehouse\'s special position, and\r\nwas sympathetic as became a woman who had "gone through" similar\r\nexperiences. When she had got through her visit and was going home, it\r\nstruck her with considerable surprise to see the cab still lingering\r\nabout the corner of Prickett\'s Lane. Was Elsworthy\'s pet boy\r\ndelivering his newspapers from that dignified elevation? or were they\r\nseizing the opportunity of conveying away the unfortunate little girl\r\nwho had caused so much annoyance to everybody? When she went closer,\r\nwith a little natural curiosity to see what else might be inside\r\nbesides the furtive errand-boy, the cab made a little rush away from\r\nher, and the blinds were drawn down. Mrs Morgan smiled a little to\r\nherself with dignified calm. "As if it was anything to me!" she said\r\nto herself; and so went home to put out the dessert with her own\r\nhands. She even cut a few fronds of her favourite maidenhair to\r\ndecorate the peaches, of which she could not help being a little\r\nproud. "I must speak to Mr Wentworth, if he comes, to keep on\r\nThompson," she said to herself, and then gave a momentary sigh at the\r\nthought of the new flue, which was as good as her own invention, and\r\nwhich it had cost her both time and money to arrange to her\r\nsatisfaction. The peaches were lovely, but who could tell what they\r\nmight be next year if a new Rector came who took no interest in the\r\ngarden?--for Thomson, though he was a very good servant, required to\r\nbe looked after, as indeed most good servants do. Mrs Morgan sighed a\r\nlittle when she thought of all her past exertions and the pains, of\r\nwhich she was scarcely yet beginning to reap the fruit. One man\r\nlabours, and another enters into his labours. One thing, however, was\r\na little consolatory, that she could take her ferns with her. But on\r\nthe whole, after the first outburst of feeling, the idea of change,\r\nnotwithstanding all its advantages, was in itself, like most human\r\nthings, a doubtful pleasure. To be sure, it was only through its\r\nproducts that her feelings were interested about the new flue, whereas\r\nthe drawing-room carpet was a standing grievance. When it was time to\r\ndress for dinner, the Rector\'s wife was not nearly so sure as before\r\nthat she had never liked Carlingford. She began to forget the thoughts\r\nshe had entertained about broken idols, and to remember a number of\r\ninconveniences attending a removal. Who would guarantee the safe\r\ntransit of the china, not to speak of the _old_ china, which was one\r\nof the most valuable decorations of the Rectory? This kind of\r\nbreakage, if not more real, was at least likely to force itself more\r\nupon the senses than the other kind of fracture which this morning\'s\r\nexplanation had happily averted; and altogether it was with mingled\r\nfeelings that Mrs Morgan entered the drawing-room, and found it\r\noccupied by Mr Leeson, who always came too early, and who, on the\r\npresent occasion, had some sufficiently strange news to tell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Wentworth did not accept Mrs Morgan\'s sudden invitation, partly\r\nbecause his "people" did not leave Carlingford that evening, and\r\npartly because, though quite amiably disposed towards the Rector, whom\r\nhe had worsted in fair fight, he was not sufficiently interested in\r\nanything he was likely to hear or see in Mr Morgan\'s house to move him\r\nto spend his evening there. He returned a very civil answer to the\r\ninvitation of the Rector\'s wife, thanking her warmly for her\r\nfriendliness, and explaining that he could not leave his father on the\r\nlast night of his stay in Carlingford; after which he went to dinner\r\nat his aunts\', where the household was still much agitated. Not to\r\nspeak of all the events which had happened and were happening, Jack,\r\nwho had begun to tire of his new character of the repentant prodigal,\r\nhad shown himself in a new light that evening, and was preparing to\r\nleave, to the relief of all parties. The prodigal, who no longer\r\npretended to be penitent, had taken the conversation into his own\r\nhands at dinner. "I have had things my own way since I came here,"\r\nsaid Jack; "somehow it appears I have a great luck for having things\r\nmy own way. It is you scrupulous people who think of others and of\r\nsuch antiquated stuff as duty, and so forth, that get yourselves into\r\ndifficulties. My dear aunt, I am going away; if I were to remain an\r\ninmate of this house--I mean to say, could I look forward to the\r\nprivilege of continuing a member of this Christian family--another\r\nday, I should know better how to conduct myself; but I am going back\r\nto my bad courses, aunt Dora; I am returning to the world--"\r\n\r\n"Oh! Jack, my dear, I hope not," said aunt Dora, who was much\r\nbewildered, and did not know what to say.\r\n\r\n"Too true," said the relapsed sinner; "and considering all the lessons\r\nyou have taught me, don\'t you think it is the best thing I could do?\r\nThere is my brother Frank, who has been carrying other people about on\r\nhis shoulders, and doing his duty; but I don\'t see that you good\r\npeople are at all moved in his behalf. You leave him to fight his way\r\nby himself, and confer your benefits elsewhere, which is an odd sort\r\nof lesson for a worldling like me. As for Gerald, you know he\'s a\r\nvirtuous fool, as I have heard you all declare. There is nothing in\r\nthe world that I can see to prevent him keeping his living and doing\r\nas he pleases, as most parsons do. However, that\'s his own business.\r\nIt is Frank\'s case which is the edifying case to me. If my convictions\r\nof sin had gone just a step farther," said the pitiless critic, "if I\r\nhad devoted myself to bringing others to repentance, as is the first\r\nduty of a reformed sinner, my aunt Leonora would not have hesitated to\r\ngive Skelmersdale to me--"\r\n\r\n"Jack, hold your tongue," said Miss Leonora; but though her cheeks\r\nburned, her voice was not so firm as usual, and she actually failed in\r\nputting down the man who had determined to have his say.\r\n\r\n"Fact, my dear aunt," said Jack; "if I had been a greater rascal than\r\nI am, and gone a little farther, you and your people would have\r\nthought me quite fit for a cure of souls. I\'d have come in for your\r\ngood things that way as well as other ways; but here is Frank, who\r\neven I can see is a right sort of parson. I don\'t pretend to fixed\r\ntheological opinions," said this unlooked-for oracle, with a comic\r\nglance aside at Gerald, the most unlikely person present to make any\r\nresponse; "but, so far as I can see, he\'s a kind of fellow most men\r\nwould be glad to make a friend of when they were under a cloud--not\r\nthat he was ever very civil to me. I tell you, so far from rewarding\r\nhim for being of the true sort, you do nothing but snub him, that I\r\ncan see. He looks to me as good for work as any man I know; but\r\nyou\'ll give your livings to any kind of wretched make-believe before\r\nyou\'ll give them to Frank. I am aware," said the heir of the\r\nWentworths, with a momentary flush, "that I have never been considered\r\nmuch of a credit to the family; but if I were to announce my intention\r\nof marrying and settling, there is not one of the name that would not\r\nlend a hand to smooth matters. That is the reward of wickedness," said\r\nJack, with a laugh; "as for Frank, he\'s a perpetual curate, and may\r\nmarry perhaps fifty years hence; that\'s the way you good people treat\r\na man who never did anything to be ashamed of in his life; and you\r\nexpect me to give up my evil courses after such a lesson? I trust I am\r\nnot such a fool," said the relapsed prodigal. He sat looking at them\r\nall in his easy way, enjoying the confusion, the indignation, and\r\nwrath with which his address was received. "The man who gets his own\r\nway is the man who takes it," he concluded, with his usual composure,\r\npouring out Miss Leonora\'s glass of claret as he spoke.\r\n\r\nNobody had ever before seen the strong-minded woman in so much\r\nagitation. "Frank knows what my feelings are," she said, abruptly. "I\r\nhave a great respect for himself, but I have no confidence in his\r\nprinciples. I--I have explained my ideas about Church patronage--"\r\n\r\nBut here the Squire broke in. "I always said, sir," said the old man,\r\nwith an unsteady voice, "that if I ever lived to see a thing or two\r\namended that was undoubtedly objectionable, your brother Jack\'s advice\r\nwould be invaluable to the family as a--as a man of the world. I have\r\nnothing to say against clergymen, sir," continued the Squire, without\r\nit being apparent whom he was addressing, "but I have always expressed\r\nmy conviction of--of the value of your brother Jack\'s advice as--as a\r\nman of the world."\r\n\r\nThis speech had a wonderful effect upon the assembled family, but most\r\nof all upon the son thus commended, who lost all his ease and\r\ncomposure as his father spoke, and turned his head stiffly to one\r\nside, as if afraid to meet the Squire\'s eyes, which indeed were not\r\nseeking his, but were fixed upon the table, as was natural,\r\nconsidering the state of emotion in which Mr Wentworth was. As for\r\nJack, when he had steadied himself a little, he got up from his seat\r\nand tried to laugh, though the effort was far from being a successful\r\none.\r\n\r\n"Even my father applauds me, you see, because I am a scamp and don\'t\r\ndeserve it," he said, with a voice which was partially choked.\r\n"Good-bye, sir; I am going away."\r\n\r\nThe Squire rose too, with the hazy bewildered look of which his other\r\nchildren were afraid.\r\n\r\n"Good-bye, sir," said the old man, and then made a pause before he\r\nheld out his hand. "You\'ll not forget what I\'ve said, Jack," he added,\r\nwith a little haste. "It\'s true enough, though I haven\'t that\r\nconfidence in you that--that I might have had. I am getting old, and I\r\nhave had two attacks, sir," said Mr Wentworth, with dignity; "and\r\nanyhow, I can\'t live for ever. Your brothers can make their own way in\r\nthe world, but I haven\'t saved all that I could have wished. When I am\r\ngone, Jack, be just to the girls and the little children," said the\r\nSquire; and with that took his son\'s hand and grasped it hard, and\r\nlooked his heir full in the face.\r\n\r\nJack Wentworth was not prepared for any such appeal; he was still less\r\nprepared to discover the unexpected and inevitable sequence with which\r\none good sentiment leads to another. He quite faltered and broke down\r\nin this unlooked-for emergency. "Father," he said unawares, for the\r\nfirst time for ten years, "if you wish it, I will join you in breaking\r\nthe entail."\r\n\r\n"No such thing, sir," said the Squire, who, so far from being pleased,\r\nwas irritated and disturbed by the proposal. "I ask you to do your\r\nduty, sir, and not to shirk it," the head of the house said, with\r\nnatural vehemence, as he stood with that circle of Wentworths round\r\nhim, giving forth his code of honour to his unworthy heir.\r\n\r\nWhile his father was speaking, Jack recovered a little from his\r\nmomentary _attendrissement_. "Good-bye, sir; I hope you\'ll live a\r\nhundred years," he said, wringing his father\'s hand, "if you don\'t\r\nlast out half-a-dozen of me, as you ought to do. But I\'d rather not\r\nanticipate such a change. In that case," the prodigal went on with a\r\ncertain huskiness in his voice, "I daresay I should not turn out so\r\ngreat a rascal as--as I ought to do. To-day and yesterday it has even\r\noccurred to me by moments that I was your son, sir," said Jack\r\nWentworth; and then he made an abrupt stop and dropped the Squire\'s\r\nhand, and came to himself in a surprising way. When he turned towards\r\nthe rest of the family, he was in perfect possession of his usual\r\ncourtesy and good spirits. He nodded to them all round--with superb\r\ngood-humour. "Good-bye, all of you; I wish you better luck, Frank, and\r\nnot so much virtue. Perhaps you will have a better chance now the lost\r\nsheep has gone back to the wilderness. Good-bye to you all. I don\'t\r\nthink I\'ve any other last words to say." He lighted his cigar with his\r\nordinary composure in the hall, and whistled one of his favourite airs\r\nas he went through the garden. "Oddly enough, however, our friend\r\nWodehouse can beat me in that," he said, with a smile, to Frank, who\r\nhad followed him out, "perhaps in other things too, who knows?\r\nGood-bye, and good-luck, old fellow." And thus the heir of the\r\nWentworths disappeared into the darkness, which swallowed him up, and\r\nwas seen no more.\r\n\r\nBut naturally there was a good deal of commotion in the house. Miss\r\nLeonora, who never had known what it was to have nerves in the entire\r\ncourse of her existence, retired to her own room with a headache, to\r\nthe entire consternation of the family. She had been a strong-minded\r\nwoman all her life, and managed everybody\'s affairs without being\r\ndistracted and hampered in her career by those doubts of her own\r\nwisdom, and questions as to her own motives, which will now and then\r\nafflict the minds of weaker people when they have to decide for\r\nothers. But this time an utterly novel and unexpected accident had\r\nbefallen Miss Leonora; a man of no principles at all had delivered his\r\nopinion upon her conduct--and so far from finding his criticism\r\ncontemptible, or discovering in it the ordinary outcry of the wicked\r\nagainst the righteous, she had found it true, and by means of it had\r\nfor perhaps the first time in her life seen herself as others saw her.\r\nNeither was the position in which she found herself one from which she\r\ncould get extricated even by any daring arbitrary exertion of will,\r\nsuch as a woman in difficulties is sometimes capable of. To be sure,\r\nshe might still have cut the knot in a summary feminine way; might\r\nhave said "No" abruptly to Julia Trench and her curate, and, after\r\nall, have bestowed Skelmersdale, like any other prize or reward of\r\nvirtue, upon her nephew Frank--a step which Miss Dora Wentworth would\r\nhave concluded upon at once without any hesitation. The elder sister,\r\nhowever, was gifted with a truer perception of affairs. Miss Leonora\r\nknew that there were some things which could be done, and yet could\r\nnot be done--a piece of knowledge difficult to a woman. She recognised\r\nthe fact that she had committed herself, and got into a corner from\r\nwhich there was but one possible egress; and as she acknowledged this\r\nto herself, she saw at the same time that Julia Trench (for whom she\r\nhad been used to entertain a good-humoured contempt as a clever sort\r\nof girl enough) had managed matters very cleverly, and that, instead of\r\ndispensing her piece of patronage like an optimist to the best, she had,\r\nin fact, given it up to the most skilful and persevering angler, as any\r\nother woman might have done. The blow was bitter, and Miss Leonora did\r\nnot seek to hide it from herself, not to say that the unpleasant\r\ndiscovery was aggravated by having been thus pointed out by Jack, who in\r\nhis own person had taken her in, and cheated his sensible aunt. She felt\r\nhumbled, and wounded in the tenderest point, to think that her reprobate\r\nnephew had seen through her, but that she had not been able to see\r\nthrough him, and had been deceived by his professions of penitence. The\r\nmore she turned it over in her mind, the more Miss Leonora\'s head ached;\r\nfor was it not growing apparent that she, who prided herself so much on\r\nher impartial judgment, had been moved, not by heroic and stoical\r\njustice and the love of souls, but a good deal by prejudice and a good\r\ndeal by skilful artifice, and very little indeed by that highest motive\r\nwhich she called the glory of God? And it was Jack who had set all this\r\nbefore her clear as daylight. No wonder the excellent woman was\r\ndisconcerted. She went to bed gloomily with her headache, and would\r\ntolerate no ministrations, neither of sal-volatile nor eau-de-Cologne,\r\nnor even of green tea. "It always does Miss Dora a power of good," said\r\nthe faithful domestic who made this last suggestion; but Miss Leonora\r\nanswered only by turning the unlucky speaker out of the room, and\r\nlocking the door against any fresh intrusion. Miss Dora\'s innocent\r\nheadaches were articles of a very different kind from this, which\r\nproceeded neither from the heart nor the digestion, but from the\r\nconscience, as Miss Leonora thought--with, possibly, a little aid from\r\nthe temper, though she was less conscious of that. It was indeed a long\r\nseries of doubts and qualms, and much internal conflict, which resulted\r\nthrough the rapidly-maturing influences of mortification and humbled\r\nself-regard, in this ominous and awe-inspiring Headache which startled\r\nthe entire assembled family, and added fresh importance to the general\r\ncrisis of Wentworth affairs.\r\n\r\n"I should not wonder if it was the Wentworth complaint," said Miss\r\nDora, with a sob of fright, to the renewed and increased indignation\r\nof the Squire.\r\n\r\n"I have already told you that the Wentworth complaint never attacks\r\nfemales," Mr Wentworth said emphatically, glad to employ what sounded\r\nlike a contemptuous title for the inferior sex.\r\n\r\n"Yes, oh yes; but then Leonora is not exactly what you would call--a\r\nfemale," said poor Miss Dora, from whom an emergency so unexpected\r\nhad taken all her little wits.\r\n\r\nWhile the house was in such an agitated condition, it is not to be\r\nsupposed that it could be very comfortable for the gentlemen when they\r\ncame up-stairs to the drawing-room, and found domestic sovereignty\r\noverthrown by a headache which nobody could comprehend, and chaos\r\nreigning in Miss Leonora\'s place. Naturally there was, for one of the\r\nparty at least, a refuge sweet and close at hand, to which his\r\nthoughts had escaped already. Frank Wentworth did not hesitate to\r\nfollow his thoughts. Against the long years when family bonds make up\r\nall that is happiest in life, there must always be reckoned those\r\nmoments of agitation and revolution, during which the bosom of a\r\nfamily is the most unrestful and disturbing place in existence, from\r\nwhich it is well to have a personal refuge and means of escape. The\r\nPerpetual Curate gave himself a little shake, and drew a long breath,\r\nas he emerged from one green door in Grange Lane and betook himself to\r\nanother. He shook himself clear of all the Wentworth perplexities, all\r\nthe family difficulties and doubts, and betook himself into the\r\nparadise which was altogether his own, and where there were no\r\nconflicting interests or differences of opinion. He was in such a\r\nhurry to get there that he did not pay any attention to the general\r\naspect of Grange Lane, or to the gossips who were gathered round\r\nElsworthy\'s door: all that belonged to a previous stage of existence.\r\nAt present he was full of the grand discovery, boldly stated by his\r\nbrother Jack--"The man who gets his own way is the man who _takes_\r\nit." It was not an elevated doctrine, or one that had hitherto\r\ncommended itself specially to the mind of the Perpetual Curate; but he\r\ncould not help thinking of his father\'s pathetic reliance upon Jack\'s\r\nadvice as a man of the world, as he laid up in his mind the prodigal\'s\r\nmaxim, and felt, with a little thrill of excitement, that he was about\r\nto act on it; from which manner of stating the case Mr Wentworth\'s\r\nfriends will perceive that self-will had seized upon him in the worst\r\nform; for he was not going boldly up to the new resolution with his\r\neyes open, but had resigned himself to the tide, which was gradually\r\nrising in one united flux of love, pride, impatience, sophistry, and\r\ninclination; which he watched with a certain passive content, knowing\r\nthat the stormy current would carry him away.\r\n\r\nMr Wentworth, however, reckoned without his host, as is now and then\r\nthe case with most men, Perpetual Curates included. He walked into the\r\nother drawing-room, which was occupied only by two ladies, where the\r\nlamp was burning softly on the little table in the corner, and the\r\nwindows, half open, admitted the fragrant air, the perfumed breath and\r\nstillness and faint inarticulate noises of the night. Since the visit\r\nof Wodehouse in the morning, which had driven Lucy into her first fit\r\nof passion, an indescribable change had come over the house, which had\r\nnow returned to the possession of its former owners, and looked again\r\nlike home. It was very quiet in the familiar room which Mr Wentworth\r\nknew so well, for it was only when excited by events "beyond their\r\ncontrol," as Miss Wodehouse said, that the sisters could forget what\r\nhad happened so lately--the loss which had made a revolution in their\r\nworld. Miss Wodehouse, who for the first time in her life was busy,\r\nand had in hand a quantity of mysterious calculations and lists to\r\nmake out, sat at the table in the centre of the room, with her desk\r\nopen, and covered with long slips of paper. Perhaps it was to save her\r\nRector the trouble that the gentle woman gave herself so much labour;\r\nperhaps she liked putting down on paper all the things that were\r\nindispensable for the new establishment. At all events, she looked up\r\nonly to give Mr Wentworth a smile and sisterly nod of welcome as he\r\ncame in and made his way to the corner where Lucy sat, not\r\nunexpectant. Out of the disturbed atmosphere he had just left, the\r\nPerpetual Curate came softly into that familiar corner, feeling that\r\nhe had suddenly reached his haven, and that Eden itself could not\r\nhave possessed a sweeter peace. Lucy in her black dress, with traces\r\nof the exhaustion of nature in her face, which was the loveliest face\r\nin the world to Mr Wentworth, looked up and welcomed him with that\r\nlook of satisfaction and content which is the highest compliment one\r\nhuman creature can pay to another. His presence rounded off all the\r\ncorners of existence to Lucy for that moment at least, and made the\r\nworld complete and full. He sat down beside her at her work-table with\r\nno further interruption to the _t\xeate-\xe0-t\xeate_ than the presence of the\r\nkind elder sister at the table, who was absorbed in her lists, and\r\nwho, even had that pleasant business been wanting, was dear and\r\nfamiliar enough to both to make her spectatorship just the sweet\r\nrestraint which endears such intercourse all the more. Thus the\r\nPerpetual Curate seated himself, feeling in some degree master of the\r\nposition; and surely here, if nowhere else in the world, the young man\r\nwas justified in expecting to have his own way.\r\n\r\n"They have settled about their marriage," said Lucy, whose voice was\r\nsufficiently audible to be heard at the table, where Miss Wodehouse\r\nseized her pen hastily and plunged it into the ink, doing her best to\r\nappear unconscious, but failing sadly in the attempt. "Mr Proctor is\r\ngoing away directly to make everything ready, and the marriage is to\r\nbe on the 15th of next month."\r\n\r\n"And ours?" said Mr Wentworth, who had not as yet approached that\r\nsubject. Lucy knew that this event must be far off, and was not\r\nagitated about it as yet; on the contrary, she met his look\r\nsympathetically and with deprecation after the first natural blush,\r\nand soothed him in her feminine way, patting softly with her pretty\r\nhand the sleeve of his coat.\r\n\r\n"Nobody knows," said Lucy. "We must wait, and have patience. We have\r\nmore time to spare than they have," she added, with a little laugh.\r\n"We must wait."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see the _must_," said the Perpetual Curate. "I have been\r\nthinking it all over since the morning. I see no reason why I should\r\nalways have to give in, and wait; self-sacrifice is well enough when\r\nit can\'t be helped, but I don\'t see any reason for postponing my\r\nhappiness indefinitely. Look here, Lucy. It appears to me at present\r\nthat there are only two classes of people in the world--those who will\r\nwait, and those who won\'t. I don\'t mean to enrol myself among the\r\nmartyrs. The man who gets his own way is the man who takes it. I don\'t\r\nsee any reason in the world for concluding that I _must_ wait."\r\n\r\nLucy Wodehouse was a very good young woman, a devoted Anglican, and\r\nloyal to all her duties; but she had always been known to possess a\r\nspark of spirit, and this rebellious quality came to a sudden blaze at\r\nso unlooked-for a speech. "Mr Wentworth," said Lucy, looking the\r\nCurate in the face with a look which was equivalent to making him a\r\nlow curtsy, "I understood there were two people to be consulted as to\r\nthe must or must not;" and having entered this protest, she withdrew\r\nher chair a little farther off, and bestowed her attention absolutely\r\nupon the piece of needlework in her hand.\r\n\r\nIf the ground had suddenly been cut away underneath Frank Wentworth\'s\r\nfeet, he could not have been more surprised; for, to tell the truth,\r\nit had not occurred to him to doubt that he himself was the final\r\nauthority on this point, though, to be sure, it was part of the\r\nconventional etiquette that the lady should "fix the day." He sat\r\ngazing at her with so much surprise that for a minute or two he could\r\nsay nothing. "Lucy, I am not going to have you put yourself on the\r\nother side," he said at last; "there is not to be any opposition\r\nbetween you and me."\r\n\r\n"That is as it may be," said Lucy, who was not mollified. "You seem to\r\nhave changed your sentiments altogether since the morning, and there\r\nis no change in the circumstances, at least that I can see."\r\n\r\n"Yes, there is a great change," said the young man. "If I could have\r\nsacrificed myself in earnest and said nothing--"\r\n\r\n"Which you were quite free to do," interrupted Lucy, who, having given\r\nway to temper once to-day, found in herself an alarming proclivity\r\ntowards a repetition of the offence.\r\n\r\n"Which I was quite free to do," said the Perpetual Curate, with a\r\nsmile, "but could not, and did not, all the same. Things are\r\naltogether changed. Now, be as cross as you please, you belong to me,\r\n_Lucia mia_. To be sure, I have no money--"\r\n\r\n"I was not thinking of that," said the young lady, under her breath.\r\n\r\n"Of course one has to think about it," said Mr Wentworth; "but the\r\nquestion is, whether we shall be happier and better going on separate\r\nin our usual way, or making up our minds to give up something for the\r\ncomfort of being together. Perhaps you will forgive me for taking\r\n_that_ view of the question," said the Curate, with a little\r\nenthusiasm. "I have got tired of ascetic principles. I don\'t see why\r\nit must be best to deny myself and postpone myself to other things and\r\nother people. I begin to be of my brother Jack\'s opinion. The children\r\nof this world are wiser in their generation than the children of\r\nlight. A man who will wait has to wait. Providence does not invariably\r\nreward him after he has been tried, as we used to suppose. I am\r\nwilling to be a poor man because I can\'t help it; but I am not willing\r\nto wait and trust my happiness to the future when it is in my reach\r\nnow," said the unreasonable young man, to whom it was of course as\r\neasy as it was to Lucy to change the position of his chair, and\r\nprevent the distance between them being increased. Perhaps he might\r\nhave carried his point even at that moment, had not Miss Wodehouse,\r\nwho had heard enough to alarm her, come forward hastily in a fright on\r\nthe prudential side.\r\n\r\n"I could not help hearing what you were saying," said the elder\r\nsister. "Oh, Mr Wentworth, I hope you don\'t mean to say that you can\'t\r\ntrust Providence? I am sure that is not Lucy\'s way of thinking. I\r\nwould not mind, and I am sure she would not mind, beginning very\r\nquietly; but then you have nothing, next to nothing, neither of you.\r\nIt might not matter, just at the first," said Miss Wodehouse, with\r\nserious looks; "but then--afterwards, you know," and a vision of a\r\nnursery flashed upon her mind as she spoke. "Clergymen always have\r\nsuch large families," she said half out before she was aware, and\r\nstopped, covered with confusion, not daring to look at Lucy to see\r\nwhat effect such a suggestion might have had upon her. "I mean," cried\r\nMiss Wodehouse, hurrying on to cover over her inadvertence if\r\npossible, "I have seen such cases; and a poor clergyman who has to\r\nthink of the grocer\'s bill and the baker\'s bill instead of his parish\r\nand his duty--there are some things you young people know a great deal\r\nbetter than I do, but you don\'t know how dreadful it is to see that."\r\n\r\nHere Lucy, on her part, was touched on a tender point, and interposed.\r\n"For a man to be teased about bills," said the young housekeeper, with\r\nflushed cheeks and an averted countenance, "it must be not his\r\npoverty, but his--his wife\'s fault."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Lucy, don\'t say so," cried Miss Wodehouse; "what is a poor woman\r\nto do, especially when she has no money of her own, as you wouldn\'t\r\nhave? and then the struggling, and getting old before your time, and\r\nall the burdens--"\r\n\r\n"Please don\'t say any more," said Lucy; "there was no intention on--on\r\nany side to drive things to a decision. As for me, I have not a high\r\nopinion of myself. I would not be the means of diminishing anyone\'s\r\ncomforts," said the spiteful young woman. "How can I be sure that I\r\nmight not turn out a very poor compensation? We settled this morning\r\nhow all that was to be, and I for one have not changed my mind--as\r\nyet," said Lucy. That was all the encouragement Mr Wentworth got when\r\nhe propounded his new views. Things looked easy enough when he was\r\nalone, and suffered himself to drift on pleasantly on the changed and\r\nheightened current of personal desires and wishes; but it became\r\napparent to him, after that evening\'s discussion, that even in Eden\r\nitself, though the dew had not yet dried on the leaves, it would be\r\nhighly incautious for any man to conclude that he was sure of having\r\nhis own way. The Perpetual Curate returned a sadder and more doubtful\r\nman to Mrs Hadwin\'s, to his own apartments; possibly, as the two\r\nstates of mind so often go together, a wiser individual too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dinner-party at the Rectory, to which Mr Wentworth did not go, was\r\nmuch less interesting and agreeable than it might have been had he been\r\npresent. As for the Rector and his wife, they could not but feel\r\nthemselves in a somewhat strange position, having between them a secret\r\nunsuspected by the company. It was difficult to refrain from showing a\r\ncertain flagging of interest in the question of the church\'s\r\nrestoration, about which, to be sure, Mr Finial was just as much\r\nconcerned as he had been yesterday; though Mr Morgan, and even Mrs\r\nMorgan, had suffered a great and unexplainable diminution of enthusiasm.\r\nAnd then Mr Leeson, who was quite unaware of the turn that things had\r\ntaken, and who was much too obtuse to understand how the Rector could be\r\nanything but exasperated against the Perpetual Curate by the failure of\r\nthe investigation, did all that he could to make himself disagreeable,\r\nwhich was saying a good deal. When Mrs Morgan came into the\r\ndrawing-room, and found this obnoxious individual occupying the most\r\ncomfortable easy-chair, and turning over at his ease the great book of\r\nferns, nature-printed, which was the pet decoration of the table, her\r\nfeelings may be conceived by any lady who has gone through a similar\r\ntrial; for Mr Leeson\'s hands were not of the irreproachable purity which\r\nbecomes the fingers of a gentleman when he goes out to dinner. "I know\r\nsome people who always wear gloves when they turn over a portfolio of\r\nprints," Mrs Morgan said, coming to the Curate\'s side to protect her\r\nbook if possible, "and these require quite as much care;" and she had to\r\nendure a discussion upon the subject, which was still more trying to her\r\nfeelings, for Mr Leeson pretended to know about ferns on the score of\r\nhaving a Wardian case in his lodgings (which belonged to his landlady),\r\nthough in reality he could scarcely tell the commonest spleenwort from a\r\nlycopodium. While Mrs Morgan went through this trial, it is not to be\r\nwondered at if she hugged to her heart the new idea of leaving\r\nCarlingford, and thought to herself that whatever might be the character\r\nof the curate (if there was one) at Scarsfield, any change from Mr\r\nLeeson must be for the better. And then the unfortunate man, as if he\r\nwas not disagreeable enough already, began to entertain his unwilling\r\nhostess with the latest news.\r\n\r\n"There is quite a commotion in Grange Lane," said Mr Leeson. "Such\r\nconstant disturbances must deteriorate the property, you know. Of\r\ncourse, whatever one\'s opinion may be, one must keep it to one\'s self,\r\nafter the result of the investigation; though I can\'t say _I_ have\r\nunbounded confidence in trial by jury," said the disagreeable young\r\nman.\r\n\r\n"I am afraid I am very slow of comprehension," said the Rector\'s wife.\r\n"I don\'t know in the least what you mean about trial by jury. Perhaps\r\nit would be best to put the book back on the table; it is too heavy\r\nfor you to hold."\r\n\r\n"Oh, it doesn\'t matter," said Mr Leeson--"I mean about Wentworth, of\r\ncourse. When a man is popular in society, people prefer to shut their\r\neyes. I suppose the matter is settled for the present, but you and I\r\nknow better than to believe--"\r\n\r\n"I beg you will speak for yourself, Mr Leeson," said Mrs Morgan, with\r\ndignity. "I have always had the highest respect for Mr Wentworth."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I beg your pardon," said the disagreeable Curate. "I forgot;\r\nalmost all the ladies are on Mr Wentworth\'s side. It appears that\r\nlittle girl of Elsworthy\'s has disappeared again; that was all I was\r\ngoing to say."\r\n\r\nAnd, fortunately for the Curate, Colonel Chiley, who entered the room\r\nat the moment, diverted from him the attention of the lady of the\r\nhouse; and after that there was no opportunity of broaching the\r\nsubject again until dinner was almost over. Then it was perhaps the\r\nAll-Souls pudding that warmed Mr Leeson\'s soul; perhaps he had taken a\r\nlittle more wine than usual. He took sudden advantage of that curious\r\nlittle pause which occurs at a well-conducted dinner-table, when the\r\nmeal is concluded, and the fruit (considered apparently, in orthodox\r\ncircles, a paradisiacal kind of food which needs no blessing) alone\r\nremains to be discussed. As soon as the manner of thanks from the foot\r\nof the table was over, the Curate incautiously rushed in before\r\nanybody else could break the silence, and delivered his latest\r\ninformation at a high pitch of voice.\r\n\r\n"Has anyone heard about the Elsworthys?" said Mr Leeson; "something\r\nfresh has happened there. I hope your verdict yesterday will not be\r\ncalled in question. The fact is, I believe that the girl has been\r\ntaken away again. They say she has gone and left a letter saying that\r\nshe is to be made a lady of. I don\'t know what we are to understand by\r\nthat. There was some private service or other going on at St Roque\'s\r\nvery early in the morning. Marriage is a sacrament, you know. Perhaps\r\nMr Wentworth or his brother--"\r\n\r\n"They are a queer family, the Wentworths," said old Mr Western, "and\r\nsuch lots of them, sir--such lots of them. The old ladies seem to have\r\nsettled down here. I am not of their way of thinking, you know, but\r\nthey\'re very good to the poor."\r\n\r\n"Mr Frank Wentworth is going to succeed his brother, I suppose," said\r\nMr Leeson; "it is very lucky for a man who gets himself talked of to\r\nhave a family living to fall back upon--"\r\n\r\n"No such thing--no such thing," said Mr Proctor, hastily. "Mr Frank\r\nWentworth means to stay here."\r\n\r\n"Dear me!" said the disagreeable Curate, with an elaborate pause of\r\nastonishment. "Things must be bad indeed," added that interesting\r\nyouth, with solemnity, shaking the devoted head, upon which he did not\r\nknow that Mrs Morgan had fixed her eyes, "if his own family give him\r\nup, and leave him to starve here. They would never give him up if they\r\nhad not very good cause. Oh, come; I shouldn\'t like to believe that!\r\n_I_ know how much a curate has to live on," said Mr Leeson, with a\r\nsmile of engaging candour. "Before they give him up like that, with\r\ntwo livings in the family, they must have very good cause."\r\n\r\n"Very good cause indeed," said Mrs Morgan, from the head of the table.\r\nThe company in general had, to tell the truth, been a little taken\r\naback by the Curate\'s observations; and there was almost the entire\r\nlength of the table between the unhappy man and the Avenger. "So good\r\na reason, that it is strange how it should not have occurred to a\r\nbrother clergyman. That is the evil of a large parish," said the\r\nRector\'s wife, with beautiful simplicity; "however hard one works, one\r\nnever can know above half of the poor people; and I suppose you have\r\nbeen occupied in the other districts, and have not heard what a great\r\nwork Mr Wentworth is doing. I have reason to know," said Mrs Morgan,\r\nwith considerable state, "that he will remain in Carlingford, in a\r\nvery different position from that which he has filled hitherto. Mr\r\nLeeson knows how much a curate has to live upon, but I am afraid that\r\nis all he does know of such a life as Mr Wentworth\'s." Mrs Morgan\r\npaused for a moment to get breath, for her excitement was\r\nconsiderable, and she had many wrongs to avenge. "There is a great\r\ndeal of difference in curates as well as in other things," said the\r\nindignant woman. "I have reason to know that Mr Wentworth will remain\r\nin Carlingford in quite a different position. Now and then, even in\r\nthis world, things come right like a fairy tale--that is, when the\r\nauthority is in the right hands;" the Rector\'s wife went on, with a\r\nsmile at her husband, which disarmed that astonished man. "Perhaps if\r\nMr Leeson had the same inducement as Mr Wentworth, he too would make\r\nup his mind to remain in Carlingford." Mrs Morgan got up, as she made\r\nthis speech, with a rustle and sweep of drapery which seemed all\r\naddressed to the unhappy Curate, who stumbled upon his feet like the\r\nother gentlemen, but dared not for his life have approached her to\r\nopen the door. Mr Leeson felt that he had received his _cong\xe9_, as he\r\nsank back into his chair. He was much too stunned to speculate on the\r\nsubject, or ask himself what was going to happen. Whatever was going\r\nto happen, there was an end of _him_. He had eaten the last All-Souls\r\npudding that he ever would have presented to him under _that_ roof. He\r\nsank back in the depth of despair upon his seat, and suffered the\r\nclaret to pass him in the agony of his feelings. Mr Wentworth and Mrs\r\nMorgan were avenged.\r\n\r\nThis was how it came to be noised abroad in Carlingford that some great\r\nchange of a highly favourable character was about to occur in the\r\ncircumstances and position of the Curate of St Roque\'s. It was discussed\r\nnext day throughout the town, as soon as people had taken breath after\r\ntelling each other about Rosa Elsworthy, who had indisputably been\r\ncarried off from her uncle\'s house on the previous night. When the\r\nWentworth family were at dinner, and just as the board was being spread\r\nin the Rectory, where Mrs Morgan was half an hour later than usual,\r\nhaving company, it had been discovered in Elsworthy\'s that the prison\r\nwas vacant, and the poor little bird had flown. Mr Wentworth was aware\r\nof a tumult about the shop when he went to the Miss Wodehouses, but\r\nwas preoccupied, and paid no attention; but Mr Leeson, who was not\r\npreoccupied, had already heard all about it when he entered the Rectory.\r\nThat day it was all over the town, as may be supposed. The poor, little,\r\nwicked, unfortunate creature had disappeared, no one knew how, at the\r\nmoment, apparently, when Elsworthy went to the railway for the evening\r\npapers, a time when the errand-boys were generally rampant in the\r\nwell-conducted shop. Mrs Elsworthy, for her part, had seized that moment\r\nto relieve her soul by confiding to Mrs Hayles next door how she was\r\nworrited to death with one thing and another, and did not expect to be\r\nalive to tell the tale if things went on like this for another month,\r\nbut that Elsworthy was infatuated like, and wouldn\'t send the hussy\r\naway, his wife complained to her sympathetic neighbour. When Elsworthy\r\ncame back, however, he was struck by the silence in the house, and sent\r\nthe reluctant woman up-stairs--"To see if she\'s been and made away with\r\nherself, I suppose," the indignant wife said, as she obeyed, leaving Mrs\r\nHayles full of curiosity on the steps of the door. Mrs Elsworthy,\r\nhowever uttered a shriek a moment after, and came down, with a\r\nfrightened face, carrying a large pin-cushion, upon which, skewered\r\nthrough and through with the biggest pin she could find, Rosa had\r\ndeposited her letter of leave-taking. This important document was read\r\nover in the shop by an ever-increasing group, as the news got\r\nabroad--for Elsworthy, like his wife, lost his head, and rushed about\r\nhither and thither, asking wild questions as to who had seen her last.\r\nPerhaps, at the bottom, he was not so desperate as he looked, but was\r\nrather grateful than angry with Rosa for solving the difficulty. This is\r\nwhat the poor little runaway said:--\r\n\r\n\r\n "DEAR UNCLE AND AUNT,--I write a line to let you know that them as can\r\n do better for me than any belonging to me has took me away for good.\r\n Don\'t make no reflections, please, nor blame nobody; for I never could\r\n have done no good nor had any \'appiness at Carlingford after all as\r\n has happened. I don\'t bear no grudge, though aunt has been so unkind;\r\n but I forgive her, and uncle also. My love to all friends; and you may\r\n tell Bob Hayles as I won\'t forget him, but will order all my physic\r\n regular at his father\'s shop.--Your affectionate niece,\r\n\r\n "ROSA."\r\n\r\n "_P.S._--Uncle has no occasion to mind, for them as has took charge of\r\n me has promised to make a lady of me, as he always said I was worthy\r\n of; and I leave all my things for aunt\'s relations, as I can\'t wear\r\n such poor clothes in my new station of life."\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch was the girl\'s letter, with its natural impertinences and natural\r\ntouch of kindness; and it made a great commotion in the neighbourhood,\r\nwhere a few spasmodic search-parties were made up with no real\r\nintentions, and came to nothing, as was to be expected. It was a\r\ndreadful thing to be sure, to happen to a respectable family; but when\r\nthings had gone so far, the neighbours, on the whole, were inclined to\r\nbelieve it was the best thing Rosa could have done; and the Elsworthys,\r\nhusband and wife, were concluded to be of the same opinion. When\r\nCarlingford had exhausted this subject, and had duly discussed the\r\nprobabilities as to where she had gone, and whether Rosa could be the\r\nlady in a veil who had been handed into the express night-train by two\r\ngentlemen, of whom a railway porter bore cautious testimony, the other\r\nmysterious rumour about Mr Wentworth had its share of popular attention.\r\nIt was discussed in Masters\'s with a solemnity becoming the occasion,\r\neverybody being convinced of the fact, and nobody knowing how it was to\r\nbe. One prevailing idea was, that Mr Wentworth\'s brother, who had\r\nsucceeded to his mother\'s fortune (which was partly true, like most\r\npopular versions of family history, his mother\'s fortune being now\r\nGerald\'s sole dependence), intended to establish a great brotherhood,\r\nupon the Claydon model, in Carlingford, of which the Perpetual Curate\r\nwas to be the head. This idea pleased the imagination of the town, which\r\nalready saw itself talked of in all the papers, and anticipated with\r\nexcitement the sight of English brothers of St Benedict walking about in\r\nthe streets, and people from the \'Illustrated News\' making drawings of\r\nGrange Lane. To be sure, Gerald Wentworth had gone over to the Church of\r\nRome, which was a step too far to be compatible with the English\r\nbrotherhood; but popular imagination, when puzzled and in a hurry, does\r\nnot take time to master all details. Then, again, opinion wavered, and\r\nit was supposed to be the Miss Wentworths who were the agents of the\r\ncoming prosperity. They had made up their mind to endow St Roque\'s and\r\napply to the Ecclesiastical Commissioners to have it erected into a\r\nparochial district, rumour reported; and the senior assistant in\r\nMasters\'s, who was suspected of Low-Church tendencies, was known to be a\r\nsupporter of this theory. Other ideas of a vague character floated\r\nthrough the town, of which no one could give any explanation; but\r\nCarlingford was unanimous in the conviction that good fortune was coming\r\nsomehow to the popular favourite, who a week ago had occupied\r\ntemporarily the position of the popular _b\xeate noire_ and impersonation\r\nof evil. "But the real sort always triumphs at the last," was the\r\nverdict of Wharfside, which like every primitive community, believed\r\nin poetic justice; and among the bargemen and their wives much\r\ngreater elevation than that of a district church or the headship of a\r\nbrotherhood was expected "for the clergyman." If the Queen had sent\r\nfor him immediately, and conferred upon him a bishopric, or at least\r\nappointed him her private chaplain, such a favour would have excited no\r\nsurprise in Wharfside, where indeed the public mind was inclined to the\r\nopinion that the real use of queens and other such dignitaries was to\r\nfind out and reward merit. Mr Wentworth himself laughed when the gossip\r\nreached his ears. "My people have given away all they had to give," he\r\nsaid to somebody who had asked the question; "and I know no prospect I\r\nhave of being anything but a perpetual curate, unless the Queen sends\r\nfor me and appoints me to a bishopric, as I understand is expected in\r\nPrickett\'s Lane. If I come to any advancement," said the Curate of St\r\nRoque\'s, "it must be in social estimation, and not in worldly wealth,\r\nwhich is out of my way;" and he went down to Wharfside rather cheerfully\r\nthan otherwise, having begun to experience that pertinacity carries the\r\nday, and that it might be possible to goad Lucy into the experiment of\r\nhow much her housekeeping talents were good for, and whether, with a\r\ngood wife, even a Perpetual Curate might be able to live without any\r\nparticular bother in respect to the grocer\'s bill. Mr Wentworth being at\r\npresent warmly engaged in this business of persuasion, and as intent as\r\never on having his own way, was not much affected by the Carlingford\r\ngossip. He went his way to Wharfside all the same, where the service was\r\nconducted as of old, and where all the humble uncertain voices were\r\nbuoyed up and carried on by the steady pure volume of liquid sound which\r\nissued from Lucy Wodehouse\'s lips into the utterance of such a\r\n\'Magnificat\' as filled Mr Wentworth\'s mind with exultation. It was the\r\nwoman\'s part in the worship--independent, yet in a sweet subordination;\r\nand the two had come back--though with the difference that their love\r\nwas now avowed and certain, and they were known to belong to each\r\nother--to much the same state of feeling in which they were before the\r\nMiss Wentworths came to Carlingford, or anything uncomfortable had\r\nhappened. They had learned various little lessons, to be sure, in the\r\ninterim, but experience had not done much more for them than it does for\r\nordinary human creatures, and the chances are that Mr Wentworth would\r\nhave conducted himself exactly in the same manner another time had he\r\nbeen placed in similar circumstances; for the lessons of experience,\r\nhowever valuable, are sometimes very slow of impressing themselves upon\r\na generous and hasty temperament, which has high ideas of honour and\r\nconsistency, and rather piques itself on a contempt for self-interest\r\nand external advantages--which was the weakness of the Curate of St\r\nRoque\'s. He returned to the "great work" in Wharfside with undiminished\r\nbelief in it, and a sense of being able to serve his God and his\r\nfellow-creatures, which, though it may seem strange to some people, was\r\na wonderful compensation to him for the loss of Skelmersdale. "After\r\nall, I doubt very much whether, under any circumstances, we could have\r\nleft such a work as is going on here," he said to Lucy as they came up\r\nPrickett\'s Lane together, where the poor woman had just died peaceably\r\nin No. 10, and got done with it, poor soul; and the Sister of Mercy, in\r\nher grey cloak, lifted towards him the blue eyes which were full of\r\ntears, and answered with natural emphasis, "Impossible! it would have\r\nbeen deserting our post," and drew a step closer to him in the twilight\r\nwith a sense of the sweetness of that plural pronoun which mingled so\r\nwith the higher sense that it was impossible to disjoin them. And the\r\ntwo went on under the influence of these combined sentiments, taking\r\ncomfort out of the very hardness of the world around them, in which\r\ntheir ministrations were so much needed, and feeling an exaltation in\r\nthe "duty," which was not for one, but for both, and a belief in the\r\npossibility of mending matters, in which their love for each other bore\r\na large share; for it was not in human nature thus to begin the ideal\r\nexistence, without believing in its universal extension, and in the\r\namelioration of life and the world.\r\n\r\n"That is all they think of," said poor Miss Wodehouse, who, between\r\nher wondering inspection of the two "young people" and her own\r\nmoderate and sensible love-affairs, and the directions which it was\r\nnecessary to give to her Rector about the furnishing of the new house,\r\nwas more constantly occupied than she had ever been in her life; "but\r\nthen, if they marry, what are they to live upon? and if they don\'t\r\nmarry--"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps something will turn up my dear," said old Mrs Western, who had\r\nan idea that Providence was bound to provide for two good young people\r\nwho wanted to marry; and thus the two ladies were forced to leave the\r\nmatter, where, indeed, the historian of events in Carlingford would\r\nwillingly leave it also, not having much faith in the rewards of virtue\r\nwhich come convenient in such an emergency. But it is only pure fiction\r\nwhich can keep true to nature, and weave its narrative in analogy with\r\nthe ordinary course of life--whereas history demands exactness in\r\nmatters of _fact_, which are seldom true to nature, or amenable to any\r\ngeneral rule of existence.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding, however, to the narrative of the unexpected\r\nadvancement and promotion which awaited the Perpetual Curate, it may be\r\nas well to notice that the Miss Wentworths, who during the summer had\r\nkindly given their house at Skelmersdale to some friends who had\r\nreturned in the spring from India, found themselves now in a position to\r\nreturn to their own proper dwelling-place, and made preparations\r\naccordingly for leaving Carlingford, in which, indeed, they had no\r\nfurther occupation; for, to be sure, except to the extent of that\r\nrespect which a man owes to his aunts, they had no special claim upon\r\nFrank Wentworth, or right to supervise his actions, save on account of\r\nSkelmersdale, which was now fully disposed of and given away. It cannot\r\nbe said that Miss Leonora had ever fully recovered from the remarkable\r\nindisposition which her nephew Jack\'s final address had brought upon\r\nher. The very next morning she fulfilled her pledges as a woman of\r\nhonour, and bestowed Skelmersdale positively and finally upon Julia\r\nTrench\'s curate, who indeed made a creditable enough rector in his way;\r\nbut after she had accomplished this act, Miss Leonora relapsed into one\r\nunceasing watch upon her nephew Frank, which was far from dispelling the\r\ntendency to headache which she showed at this period for the first and\r\nonly time in her life. She watched him with a certain feeling of\r\nexpiation, as she might have resorted to self-flagellation had she lived\r\na few hundred years before, and perhaps suffered more acute pangs in\r\nthat act of discipline than could be inflicted by any physical scourge.\r\nThe longer she studied the matter the more thoroughly was Miss Leonora\r\nconvinced not only that the Perpetual Curate was bent on doing his duty,\r\nbut that he _did_ it with all the force of high faculties, and a mind\r\nmuch more thoroughly trained, and of finer material than was possessed\r\nby the man whom she had made rector of Skelmersdale. The strong-minded\r\nwoman bore quietly, with a kind of defiance, the sharp wounds with\r\nwhich her self-esteem was pierced by this sight. She followed up her\r\ndiscovery, and made herself more and more certain of the mistake she had\r\nmade, not sparing herself any part of her punishment. As she pursued her\r\ninvestigations, too, Miss Leonora became increasingly sensible that it\r\nwas not his mother\'s family whom he resembled, as she had once thought,\r\nbut that he was out and out a Wentworth, possessed of all the family\r\nfeatures; and this was the man whom by her own act she had disinherited\r\nof his natural share in the patronage of the family, substituting for\r\nher own flesh and blood an individual for whom, to tell the truth, she\r\nhad little respect! Perhaps if she had been able to sustain herself with\r\nthe thought that it was entirely a question of "principle," the\r\nretrospect might not have been so hard upon Miss Leonora; but being a\r\nwoman of very distinct and uncompromising vision, she could not conceal\r\nfrom herself either Julia Trench\'s cleverness or her own mixed and\r\ndoubtful motives. Having this sense of wrong and injustice, and general\r\nfailure of the duty of kindred towards Frank, it might have been\r\nsupposed a little comfort to Miss Leonora to perceive that he had\r\nentirely recovered from his disappointment, and was no longer in her\r\npower, if indeed he had ever been so. But the fact was, that if anything\r\ncould have aggravated her personal smart, it would have been the fact\r\nof Frank\'s indifference and cheerfulness, and evident capability of\r\ncontenting himself with his duty and his favourite district, and his\r\nLucy--whom, to be sure, he could not marry, being only a perpetual\r\ncurate. The spectacle came to have a certain fascination for Miss\r\nWentworth. She kept watching him with a grim satisfaction, punishing\r\nherself, and at the same time comforting herself with the idea that,\r\nlight as he made of it, he must be suffering too. She could not bear to\r\nthink that he had escaped clean out of her hands, and that the decision\r\nshe had come to, which produced so much pain to herself, was innoxious\r\nto Frank; and at the same time, though she could not tolerate his\r\ncomposure, and would have preferred to see him angry and revengeful, his\r\nevident recovery of spirits and general exhilaration increased Miss\r\nLeonora\'s respect for the man she had wronged. In this condition of mind\r\nthe strong-minded aunt lingered over her preparations for removal,\r\nscorning much the rumour in Carlingford about her nephew\'s advancement,\r\nand feeling that she could never forgive him if by any chance promotion\r\nshould come to him after all. "He will stay where he is. He will be a\r\nperpetual curate," Miss Leonora said, uttering what was in reality a\r\nhope under the shape of a taunt; and things were still in this position\r\nwhen Grange Lane in general and Miss Dora in particular (from the window\r\nof the summer-house) were startled much by the sight of the Rector, in\r\nterribly correct clerical costume, as if he were going to dine with the\r\nbishop, who walked slowly down the road like a man charged with a\r\nmission, and, knocking at Mrs Hadwin\'s door, was admitted immediately to\r\na private conference with the Curate of St Roque\'s.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the same afternoon that Mr Wentworth failed to attend, as he had\r\nnever been known to fail before, at the afternoon\'s school which he had\r\nset up in Prickett\'s Lane for the young bargemen, who between the\r\nintervals of their voyages had a little leisure at that hour of the day.\r\nIt is true there was a master provided, and the presence of the\r\nPerpetual Curate was not indispensable; but the lads, among whom,\r\nindeed, there were some men, were so much used to his presence as to get\r\nrestless at their work on this unprecedented emergency. The master knew\r\nno other resource than to send for Miss Lucy Wodehouse, who was known to\r\nbe on the other side of Prickett\'s Lane at the moment, superintending a\r\nsimilar educational undertaking for the benefit of the girls. It was, as\r\nmay be supposed, embarrassing to Lucy to be called upon to render an\r\naccount of Mr Wentworth\'s absence, and invited to take his place in this\r\npublic and open manner; but then the conventional reticences were\r\nunknown in Wharfside, and nobody thought it necessary to conceal his\r\ncertainty that the Curate\'s movements were better known to Lucy than to\r\nanybody else. She had to make answer with as much composure as possible\r\nin the full gaze of so many pairs of curious eyes, that she did not know\r\nwhy Mr Wentworth was absent--"Somebody is sick, perhaps," said Lucy,\r\nrepeating an excuse which had been made before for the Perpetual Curate;\r\n"but I hope it does not make any difference," she went on, turning round\r\nupon all the upturned heads which were neglecting their work to stare at\r\nher. "Mr Wentworth would be grieved to think that his absence did his\r\nscholars any injury." Lucy looked one of the ringleaders in the eyes as\r\nshe spoke, and brought him to his senses--all the more effectually, to\r\nbe sure, because she knew all about him, and was a familiar figure to\r\nthe boy, suggesting various little comforts, for which, in Prickett\'s\r\nLane, people were not ungrateful. But when she went back again to her\r\ngirls, the young lady found herself in a state of excitement which was\r\nhalf annoyance and half a kind of shy pleasure. To be sure, it was quite\r\ntrue that they did belong to each other; but at the same time, so long\r\nas she was Lucy Wodehouse, she had no right to be called upon to\r\nrepresent "the clergyman," even in "the district" which was so important\r\nto both. And then it occurred to her to remember that if she remained\r\nLucy Wodehouse that was not the Curate\'s fault--from which thought she\r\nwent on to reflect that going away with Mr and Mrs Proctor when they\r\nwere married was not a charming prospect, not to say that it involved a\r\nrenunciation of the district for the present at least, and possibly for\r\never; for if Mr Wentworth could not marry as long as he was a perpetual\r\ncurate, it followed of necessity that he could not marry until he had left\r\nCarlingford--an idea which Lucy turned over in her mind very seriously\r\nas she walked home, for this once unattended. A new light seemed to be\r\nthrown upon the whole matter by this thought. To consent to be married\r\nsimply for her own happiness, to the disadvantage in any respect of her\r\nhusband, was an idea odious to this young woman, who, like most young\r\nwomen, preferred to represent even to herself that it was for _his_\r\nhappiness that she permitted herself to be persuaded to marry; but if\r\nduty were involved, that was quite another affair. It was quite evident\r\nto Lucy, as she walked towards Grange Lane, that the Curate would not be\r\nable to find any one to take her place in the district; perhaps\r\nalso--for she was honest even in her self-delusions--Lucy was aware that\r\nshe might herself have objections to the finding of a substitute; and\r\nwhat then? Was the great work to be interrupted because she could not\r\nbear the idea of possibly diminishing some of his external comforts by\r\nallowing him to have his way, and to be what he considered happy? Such\r\nwas the wonderful length to which her thoughts had come when she reached\r\nthe garden-door, from which Mr Wentworth himself, flushed and eager,\r\ncame hastily out as she approached. So far from explaining his\r\nunaccountable absence, or even greeting her with ordinary politeness,\r\nthe young man seized her by the arm and brought her into the garden with\r\na rapidity which made her giddy. "What is it--what do you mean?" Lucy\r\ncried with amazement as she found herself whirled through the sunshine\r\nand half carried up the stairs. Mr Wentworth made no answer until he had\r\ndeposited her breathless in her own chair, in her own corner, and then\r\ngot down on his knee beside her, as men in his crazy circumstances are\r\nnot unapt to do.\r\n\r\n"Lucy, look here. I was a perpetual curate the other day when you said\r\nyou would have me," said the energetic lover, who was certainly out of\r\nhis wits, and did not know what he was saying--"and you said you did\r\nnot mind?"\r\n\r\n"I said it did not matter," said Lucy, who was slightly piqued that he\r\ndid not recollect exactly the form of so important a decision. "I knew\r\nwell enough you were a perpetual curate. Has anything happened, or are\r\nyou going out of your mind?"\r\n\r\n"I think it must be that," said Mr Wentworth. "Something so\r\nextraordinary has happened that I cannot believe it. Was I in Prickett\'s\r\nLane this afternoon as usual, or was I at home in my own room talking to\r\nthe Rector--or have I fallen asleep somewhere, and is the whole thing a\r\ndream?"\r\n\r\n"You were certainly not in Prickett\'s Lane," said Lucy. "I see what it\r\nis. Miss Leonora Wentworth has changed her mind, and you are going to\r\nhave Skelmersdale after all. I did not think you could have made up\r\nyour mind to leave the district. It is not news that gives me any\r\npleasure," said the Sister of Mercy, as she loosed slowly off from her\r\nshoulders the grey cloak which was the uniform of the district. Her\r\nown thoughts had been so different that she felt intensely mortified\r\nto think of the unnecessary decision she had been so near making, and\r\ndisappointed that the offer of a living could have moved her lover to\r\nsuch a pitch of pleasure. "All men are alike, it seems," she said to\r\nherself, with a little quiver in her lip--a mode of forestalling his\r\ncommunications which filled the Perpetual Curate with amazement and\r\ndismay.\r\n\r\n"What are you thinking of?" he said. "Miss Leonora Wentworth has not\r\nchanged her mind. That would have been a natural accident enough, but\r\nthis is incredible. If you like, Lucy," he added, with an unsteady\r\nlaugh, "and will consent to my original proposition, you may marry on\r\nthe 15th, not the Perpetual Curate of St Roque\'s, but the Rector of\r\nCarlingford. Don\'t look at me with such an unbelieving countenance. It\r\nis quite true."\r\n\r\n"I wonder how you can talk so," cried Lucy, indignantly; "it is all a\r\nmade-up story; you know it is. I don\'t like practical jokes," she went\r\non, trembling a little, and taking another furtive look at him--for\r\nsomehow it was too wonderful not to be true.\r\n\r\n"If I had been making up a story, I should have kept to what was\r\nlikely," said Mr Wentworth. "The Rector has been with me all the\r\nafternoon--he says he has been offered his father\'s rectory, where he\r\nwas brought up, and that he has made up his mind to accept it, as he\r\nalways was fond of the country;--and that he has recommended me to his\r\nCollege for the living of Carlingford."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes," said Lucy, impatiently, "that is very good of Mr Morgan;\r\nbut you know you are not a member of the College, and why should you\r\nhave the living? I knew it could not be true."\r\n\r\n"They are all a set of old--Dons," said the Perpetual Curate; "that is,\r\nthey are the most accomplished set of fellows in existence, Lucy--or at\r\nleast they ought to be--but they are too superior to take an ordinary\r\nliving, and condescend to ordinary existence. Here has Carlingford been\r\ntwice vacant within a year--which is an unprecedented event--and Buller,\r\nthe only man who would think of it, is hanging on for a colonial\r\nbishopric, where he can publish his book at his leisure. Buller is a\r\ngreat friend of Gerald\'s. It is incredible, _Lucia mia_, but it is\r\ntrue."\r\n\r\n"Is it true? are you _sure_ it is true?" cried Lucy; and in spite of\r\nherself she broke down and gave way, and let her head rest on the first\r\nconvenient support it found, which turned out, naturally enough, to be\r\nMr Wentworth\'s shoulder, and cried as if her heart was breaking. It is\r\nso seldom in this world that things come just when they are wanted; and\r\nthis was not only an acceptable benefice, but implied the entire\r\npossession of the "district" and the most conclusive vindication of the\r\nCurate\'s honour. Lucy cried out of pride and happiness and glory in him.\r\nShe said to herself, as Mrs Morgan had done at the beginning of her\r\nincumbency, "He will be such a Rector as Carlingford has never seen."\r\nYet at the same time, apart from her glorying and her pride, a certain\r\nsense of pain, exquisite though shortlived, found expression in Lucy\'s\r\ntears. She had just been making up her mind to accept a share of his\r\nlowliness, and to show the world that even a Perpetual Curate, when his\r\nwife was equal to her position, might be poor without feeling any of the\r\ndegradations of poverty; and now she was forestalled, and had nothing to\r\ndo but accept his competence, which it would be no credit to manage\r\nwell! Such were the thoughts to which she was reduced, though she had\r\ncome home from Prickett\'s Lane persuading herself that it was duty only,\r\nand the wants of the district, which moved her. Lucy cried, although not\r\nmuch given to crying, chiefly because it was the only method she could\r\nfind of giving expression to the feelings which were too varied and too\r\ncomplicated for words.\r\n\r\nAll Carlingford knew the truth about Mr Wentworth\'s advancement that\r\nevening, and on the next day, which was Sunday, the Church of St\r\nRoque\'s was as full as if the plague had broken out in Carlingford,\r\nand the population had rushed out, as they might have done in medieval\r\ntimes, to implore the succour of the physician-saint. The first\r\nindication of the unusual throng was conveyed to Mr Wentworth in his\r\nlittle vestry after the choristers had filed into the church in their\r\nwhite surplices, about which, to tell the truth, the Perpetual Curate\r\nwas less interested than he had once been. Elsworthy, who had been\r\nhumbly assisting the young priest to robe himself, ventured to break\r\nthe silence when they were alone.\r\n\r\n"The church is very full, sir," said Elsworthy; "there\'s a deal of\r\npeople come, sir, after hearing the news. I don\'t say I\'ve always been\r\nas good a servant as I ought to have been; but it was all through\r\nbeing led away, and not knowing no better, and putting my trust where\r\nI shouldn\'t have put it. I\'ve had a hard lesson, sir, and I\'ve learnt\r\nbetter," he continued, with a sidelong glance at the Curate\'s face;\r\n"it was all a mistake."\r\n\r\n"I was not finding fault with you, that I am aware of," said Mr\r\nWentworth, with a little surprise.\r\n\r\n"No, sir," said Elsworthy, "I am aware as you wasn\'t finding no fault;\r\nbut there\'s looks as speaks as strong as words, and I can feel as you\r\nhaven\'t the confidence in me as you once had. I aint ashamed to say\r\nit, sir," continued the clerk of St Roque\'s. "I\'m one as trusted in\r\nthat girl\'s innocent looks, and didn\'t believe as she could do no\r\nharm. She\'s led me into ill-feeling with my clergyman, sir, and done\r\nme a deal o\' damage in my trade, and now she\'s gone off without as\r\nmuch as saying \'Thank you for your kindness.\' It\'s a hard blow upon a\r\nman as was fond of her, and I didn\'t make no difference, no more than\r\nif she had been my own child."\r\n\r\n"Well, well," said the Curate, "I daresay it was a trial to you; but\r\nyou can\'t expect me to take much interest in it after all that has\r\npassed. Let bygones be bygones," said Mr Wentworth, with a smile, "as\r\nindeed you once proposed."\r\n\r\n"Ah! sir, that was my mistake," sighed the penitent. "I would have\r\n\'umbled myself more becoming, if I had known all as I know now. You\'re\r\na-going off to leave St Roque\'s, where we\'ve all been so happy," said\r\nMr Elsworthy, in pathetic tones. "I don\'t know as I ever was as \'appy,\r\nsir, as here, a-listening to them beautiful sermons, and a-giving my\r\nbest attention to see as the responses was well spoke out, and things\r\ndone proper. Afore our troubles began, sir, I don\'t know as I had a\r\nwish in the world, unless it was to see an \'andsome painted window in\r\nthe chancel, which is all as is wanted to make the church perfect; and\r\nnow you\'re a-going to leave, and nobody knows what kind of a gentleman\r\nmay be sent. If you wouldn\'t think I was making too bold," said\r\nElsworthy, "it aint my opinion as you\'ll ever put up with poor old\r\nNorris as is in the church. Men like Mr Morgan and Mr Proctor as had\r\nno cultivation doesn\'t mind; but for a gentleman as goes through the\r\nservice as you does it, Mr Wentworth--"\r\n\r\nMr Wentworth laughed, though he was fully robed and ready for the\r\nreading-desk, and knew that his congregation was waiting. He held his\r\nwatch in his hand, though it already marked the half minute after\r\neleven. "So you would like to be clerk in the parish church?" he said,\r\nwith what seemed a quite unnecessary amount of amusement to the\r\nanxious functionary by his side.\r\n\r\n"I think as you could never put up with old Norris, sir," said\r\nElsworthy; "as for leading of the responses, there aint such a thing\r\ndone in Carlingford Church. I don\'t speak for myself," said the\r\npublic-spirited clerk, "but it aint a right thing for the rising\r\ngeneration; and it aint everybody as would get into your way in a\r\nminute--for you have a way of your own, sir, in most things, and if\r\nyou\'ll excuse me for saying of it, you\'re very particular. It aint\r\nevery man, sir, as could carry on clear through the service along of\r\nyou, Mr Wentworth; and you wouldn\'t put up with old Norris, not for a\r\nday."\r\n\r\nSuch was the conversation which opened this memorable Sunday to Mr\r\nWentworth. Opposite to him, again occupying the seat where his wife\r\nshould have been, had he possessed one, were the three Miss Wentworths,\r\nhis respected aunts, to whose opinion, however, the Curate did not feel\r\nhimself bound to defer very greatly in present circumstances; and a\r\nlarge and curious congregation ranged behind them, almost as much\r\nconcerned to see how Mr Wentworth would conduct himself in this moment\r\nof triumph, as they had been in the moment of his humiliation. It is,\r\nhowever, needless to inform the friends of the Perpetual Curate that the\r\nanxious community gained very little by their curiosity. It was not the\r\ncustom of the young Anglican to carry his personal feelings, either of\r\none kind or another, into the pulpit with him, much less into the\r\nreading-desk, where he was the interpreter not of his own sentiments or\r\nemotions, but of common prayer and universal worship. Mr Wentworth\r\ndid not even throw a little additional warmth into his utterance of\r\nthe general thanksgiving, as he might have done had he been a more\r\neffusive man; but, on the contrary, read it with a more than ordinary\r\ncalmness, and preached to the excited people one of those terse little\r\nunimpassioned sermons of his, from which it was utterly impossible to\r\ndivine whether he was in the depths of despair or at the summit and\r\ncrown of happiness. People who had been used to discover a great many of\r\nold Mr Bury\'s personal peculiarities in his sermons, and who, of recent\r\ndays, had found many allusions which it was easy to interpret in the\r\ndiscourses of Mr Morgan, retired altogether baffled from the clear and\r\nsuccinct brevity of the Curate of St Roque\'s. He was that day in\r\nparticular so terse as to be almost epigrammatic, not using a word\r\nmore than was necessary, and displaying that power of saying a great\r\ndeal more than at the first moment he appeared to say, in which Mr\r\nWentworth\'s admirers specially prided themselves. Perhaps a momentary\r\nhuman gratification in the consciousness of having utterly baffled\r\ncuriosity, passed through the Curate\'s mind as he took off his robes\r\nwhen the service was over; but he was by no means prepared for the\r\nordeal which awaited him when he stepped forth from the pretty porch of\r\nSt Roque\'s. There his three aunts were awaiting him, eager to hear all\r\nabout it, Miss Dora, for the first time in her life, holding the\r\nprincipal place. "We are going away to-morrow, Frank, and of course you\r\nare coming to lunch with us," said aunt Dora, clinging to his arm. "Oh,\r\nmy dear boy, I am so happy, and so ashamed, to hear of it. To think you\r\nshould be provided for, and nobody belonging to you have anything to do\r\nwith it! I don\'t know what to say," said Miss Dora, who was half crying\r\nas usual; "and as for Leonora, one is frightened to speak to her. Oh, I\r\nwish you would say something to your aunt Leonora, Frank. I don\'t know\r\nwhether she is angry with us or with you or with herself, or what it is;\r\nor if it is an attack on the nerves--though I never imagined she had any\r\nnerves; but, indeed, whatever my brother may say, it looks very\r\nlike--dreadfully like--the coming-on of the Wentworth complaint. Poor\r\npapa was just like that when he used to have it coming on; and Leonora\r\nis not just--altogether--what you would call a female, Frank. Oh, my\r\ndear boy, if you would only speak to her!" cried Miss Dora, who was a\r\ngreat deal too much in earnest to perceive anything comical in what she\r\nhad said.\r\n\r\n"I should think it must be an attack on the temper," said the Curate,\r\nwho, now that it was all over, felt that it was but just his aunt\r\nLeonora should suffer a little for her treatment of him. "Perhaps some\r\nof her favourite colporteurs have fallen back into evil ways. There was\r\none who had been a terrible blackguard, I remember. It is something that\r\nhas happened among her mission people, you may be sure, and nothing\r\nabout me."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t know Leonora, Frank. She is very fond of you, though she\r\ndoes not show it," said Miss Dora, as she led her victim in\r\ntriumphantly through the garden-door, from which the reluctant young\r\nman could see Lucy and her sister in their black dresses just arriving\r\nat the other green door from the parish church, where they had\r\noccupied their usual places, according to the ideas of propriety which\r\nwere common to both the Miss Wodehouses. Mr Wentworth had to content\r\nhimself with taking off his hat to them, and followed his aunts to the\r\ntable, where Miss Leonora took her seat much with the air of a judge\r\nabout to deliver a sentence. She did not restrain herself even in the\r\nconsideration of the presence of Lewis the butler, who, to be sure,\r\nhad been long enough in the Wentworth family to know as much about its\r\nconcerns as the members of the house themselves, or perhaps a little\r\nmore. Miss Leonora sat down grim and formidable in her bonnet, which\r\nwas in the style of a remote period, and did not soften the severity\r\nof her personal appearance. She pointed her nephew to a seat beside\r\nher, but she did not relax her features, nor condescend to any\r\nordinary preliminaries of conversation. For that day even she took\r\nLewis\'s business out of his astonished hands, and herself divided the\r\nchicken with a swift and steady knife and anatomical precision; and it\r\nwas while occupied in this congenial business that she broke forth\r\nupon Frank in a manner so unexpected as almost to take away his\r\nbreath.\r\n\r\n"I suppose this is what fools call poetic justice," said Miss Leonora,\r\n"which is just of a piece with everything else that is poetical--weak\r\nfolly and nonsense that no sensible man would have anything to say to.\r\nHow a young man like you, who know how to conduct yourself in some\r\nthings, and have, I don\'t deny, many good qualities, can give in to\r\ncome to an ending like a trashy novel, is more than I can understand.\r\nYou are fit to be put in a book of the Good-child series, Frank, as an\r\nillustration of the reward of virtue," said the strong-minded woman,\r\nwith a little snort of scorn; "and, of course, you are going to\r\nmarry, and live happy ever after, like a fairy tale."\r\n\r\n"It is possible I may be guilty of that additional enormity," said the\r\nCurate, "which, at all events, will not be your doing, my dear aunt, if\r\nI might suggest a consolation. You cannot help such things happening,\r\nbut, at least, it should be a comfort to feel you have done nothing to\r\nbring them about."\r\n\r\nTo which Miss Leonora answered by another hard breath of mingled disdain\r\nand resentment. "Whatever I have brought about, I have tried to do what\r\nI thought my duty," she said. "It has always seemed to me a very poor\r\nsort of virtue that expects a reward for doing what it ought to do. I\r\ndon\'t say you haven\'t behaved very well in this business, but you\'ve\r\ndone nothing extraordinary; and why I should have rushed out of my way\r\nto reward you for it--Oh, yes, I know you did not expect anything," said\r\nMiss Leonora; "you have told me as much on various occasions, Frank. You\r\nhave, of course, always been perfectly independent, and scorned to\r\nflatter your old aunts by any deference to their convictions; and, to be\r\nsure, it is nothing to you any little pang they may feel at having to\r\ndispose otherwise of a living that has always been in the family. You\r\nare of the latest fashion of Anglicanism, and we are only a parcel of\r\nold women. It was not to be expected that our antiquated ideas could be\r\nworth as much to you as a parcel of flowers and trumpery--"\r\n\r\nThese were actually tears which glittered in Miss Leonora\'s eyes of\r\nfiery hazel grey--tears of very diminutive size, totally unlike the\r\nbig dewdrops which rained from Miss Dora\'s placid orbs and made them\r\nred, but did _her_ no harm--but still a real moisture, forced out of a\r\nfountain which lay very deep down and inaccessible to ordinary\r\nefforts. They made her eyes look rather fiercer than otherwise for the\r\nmoment; but they all but impeded Miss Leonora\'s speech, and struck\r\nwith the wildest consternation the entire party at the table,\r\nincluding even Lewis, who stood transfixed in the act of drawing a\r\nbottle of soda-water, and, letting the cork escape him in his\r\namazement, brought affairs to an unlooked-for climax by hitting Miss\r\nWentworth, who had been looking on with interest without taking any\r\npart in the proceedings. When the fright caused by this unintentional\r\nshot had subsided, Miss Leonora was found to have entirely recovered\r\nherself; but not so the Perpetual Curate, who had changed colour\r\nwonderfully, and no longer met his accuser with reciprocal disdain.\r\n\r\n"My dear aunt," said Frank Wentworth, "I wish you would not go back to\r\nthat. I suppose we parsons are apt sometimes to exaggerate trifles\r\ninto importance, as my father says. But, however, as things have\r\nturned out, I could not have left Carlingford," the Curate added, in a\r\ntone of conciliation; "and now, when good fortune has come to me\r\nunsought--"\r\n\r\nMiss Leonora finished her portion of chicken in one energetic gulp,\r\nand got up from the table. "Poetic justice!" she said, with a furious\r\nsneer. "I don\'t believe in that kind of rubbish. As long as you were\r\ngetting on quietly with your work I felt disposed to be rather proud\r\nof you, Frank. But I don\'t approve of a man ending off neatly like a\r\nnovel in this sort of ridiculous way. When you succeed to the Rectory\r\nI suppose you will begin fighting, like the other man, with the new\r\ncurate, for working in your parish?"\r\n\r\n"When I succeed to the Rectory," said Mr Wentworth, getting up in his\r\nturn from the table, "I give you my word, aunt Leonora, no man shall\r\nwork in _my_ parish unless I set him to do it. Now I must be off to my\r\nwork. I don\'t suppose Carlingford Rectory will be the end of me," the\r\nPerpetual Curate added, as he went away, with a smile which his aunts\r\ncould not interpret. As for Miss Leonora, she tied her bonnet-strings\r\nvery tight, and went off to the afternoon service at Salem Chapel by\r\nway of expressing her sentiments more forcibly. "I daresay he\'s bold\r\nenough to take a bishopric," she said to herself; "but fortunately\r\nwe\'ve got _that_ in our own hands as long as Lord Shaftesbury lives;"\r\nand Miss Leonora smiled grimly over the prerogatives of her party. But\r\nthough she went to the Salem Chapel that afternoon, and consoled herself\r\nthat she could secure the bench of bishops from any audacious invasion\r\nof Frank Wentworth\'s hopes, it is true, notwithstanding, that Miss\r\nLeonora sent her maid next morning to London with certain obsolete\r\nornaments, of which, though the fashion was hideous, the jewels were\r\nprecious; and Lucy Wodehouse had never seen anything so brilliant as\r\nthe appearance they presented when they returned shortly after\r\nreposing upon beds of white satin in cases of velvet--"Ridiculous\r\nthings," as Miss Leonora informed her, "for a parson\'s wife."\r\n\r\nIt was some time after this--for, not to speak of ecclesiastical\r\nmatters, a removal, even when the furniture is left behind and there\r\nare only books, and rare ferns, and old china, to convey from one\r\nhouse to another, is a matter which involves delays--when Mr Wentworth\r\nwent to the railway station with Mrs Morgan to see her off finally,\r\nher husband having gone to London with the intention of joining her in\r\nthe new house. Naturally, it was not without serious thoughts that the\r\nRector\'s wife left the place in which she had made the first beginning\r\nof her active life, not so successfully as she had hoped. She could\r\nnot help recalling, as she went along the familiar road, the hopes so\r\nvivid as to be almost certainties with which she had come into\r\nCarlingford. The long waiting was then over, and the much-respected\r\nera had arrived and existence had seemed to be opening in all its\r\nfulness and strength before the two who had looked forward to it so\r\nlong. It was not much more than six months ago; but Mrs Morgan had\r\nmade a great many discoveries in the mean time. She had found out the\r\nwonderful difference between anticipation and reality; and that life,\r\neven to a happy woman married after long patience to the man of her\r\nchoice, was not the smooth road it looked, but a rough path enough\r\ncut into dangerous ruts, through which generations of men and women\r\nfollowed each other without ever being able to mend the way. She was\r\nnot so sure as she used to be of a great many important matters which\r\nit is a wonderful consolation to be certain of--but, notwithstanding,\r\nhad to go on as if she had no doubts, though the clouds of a defeat,\r\nin which, certainly, no honour, though a good deal of the _prestige_\r\nof inexperience had been lost, were still looming behind. She gave a\r\nlittle sigh as she shook Mr Wentworth\'s hand at parting. "A great many\r\nthings have happened in six months," she said--"one never could have\r\nanticipated so many changes in what looks so short a period of one\'s\r\nlife"--and as the train which she had watched so often rushed past that\r\nnew bit of wall on which the Virginian creeper was beginning to grow\r\nluxuriantly, which screened the railway from the Rectory windows, there\r\nwere tears in Mrs Morgan\'s eyes. Only six months and so much had\r\nhappened!--what might not happen in all those months, in all those years\r\nof life which scarcely looked so hopeful as of old? She preferred\r\nturning her back upon Carlingford, though it was the least comfortable\r\nside of the carriage, and put down her veil to shield her eyes from the\r\ndust, or perhaps from the inspection of her fellow-travellers: and once\r\nmore the familiar thought returned to her of what a different woman she\r\nwould have been had she come to her first experiences of life with the\r\ncourage and confidence of twenty or even of five-and-twenty, which was\r\nthe age Mrs Morgan dwelt upon most kindly. And then she thought with a\r\nthrill of vivid kindness and a touch of tender envy of Lucy Wodehouse,\r\nwho would now have no possible occasion to wait those ten years.\r\n\r\nAs for Mr Wentworth, he who was a priest, and knew more about\r\nCarlingford than any other man in the place, could not help thinking,\r\nas he turned back, of people there, to whom these six months had\r\nproduced alterations far more terrible than any that had befallen the\r\nRector\'s wife:--people from whom the light of life had died out, and\r\nto whom all the world was changed. He knew of men who had been\r\ncheerful enough when Mr Morgan came to Carlingford, who now did not\r\ncare what became of them; and of women who would be glad to lay down\r\ntheir heads and hide them from the mocking light of day. He knew it,\r\nand it touched his heart with the tenderest pity of life, the\r\ncompassion of happiness; and he knew too that the path upon which he\r\nwas about to set out led through the same glooms, and was no ideal\r\ncareer. But perhaps because Mr Wentworth was young--perhaps because he\r\nwas possessed by that delicate sprite more dainty than any Ariel who\r\nputs rosy girdles round the world while his time of triumph lasts--it\r\nis certain that the new Rector of Carlingford turned back into Grange\r\nLane without the least shadow upon his mind or timidity in his\r\nthoughts. He was now in his own domains, an independent monarch, as\r\nlittle inclined to divide his power as any autocrat; and Mr Wentworth\r\ncame into his kingdom without any doubts of his success in it, or of\r\nhis capability for its government. He had first a little journey to\r\nmake to bring back Lucy from that temporary and reluctant separation\r\nfrom the district which propriety had made needful; but, in the mean\r\ntime, Mr Wentworth trode with firm foot the streets of his parish,\r\nsecure that no parson nor priest should tithe or toll in his\r\ndominions, and a great deal more sure than even Mr Morgan had been,\r\nthat henceforth no unauthorised evangelisation should take place in\r\nany portion of his territory. This sentiment, perhaps, was the\r\nprincipal difference perceptible by the community in general between\r\nthe new Rector of Carlingford and the late Perpetual Curate of St\r\nRoque\'s.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE\r\n\r\n[1] She was the daughter of old Sir Jasper Shelton, a poor family, but\r\nvery respectable, and connected with the Westerns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSCRIBER\'S NOTE\r\n\r\nContemporary spellings have been retained even when inconsistent.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
