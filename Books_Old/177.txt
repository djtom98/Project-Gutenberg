This\r\ncommodious ottoman has since been removed, to the extreme regret of all\r\nweak-kneed lovers of the fine arts, but the gentleman in question had\r\ntaken serene possession of its softest spot, and, with his head thrown\r\nback and his legs outstretched, was staring at Murillo\xe2\x80\x99s beautiful\r\nmoon-borne Madonna in profound enjoyment of his posture. He had removed\r\nhis hat, and flung down beside him a little red guide-book and an\r\nopera-glass. The day was warm; he was heated with walking, and he\r\nrepeatedly passed his handkerchief over his forehead, with a somewhat\r\nwearied gesture. And yet he was evidently not a man to whom fatigue was\r\nfamiliar; long, lean, and muscular, he suggested the sort of vigor that\r\nis commonly known as \xe2\x80\x9ctoughness.\xe2\x80\x9d But his exertions on this particular\r\nday had been of an unwonted sort, and he had performed great physical\r\nfeats which left him less jaded than his tranquil stroll through the\r\nLouvre. He had looked out all the pictures to which an asterisk was\r\naffixed in those formidable pages of fine print in his B\xc3\xa4deker; his\r\nattention had been strained and his eyes dazzled, and he had sat down\r\nwith an \xc3\xa6sthetic headache. He had looked, moreover, not only at all the\r\npictures, but at all the copies that were going forward around them, in\r\nthe hands of those innumerable young women in irreproachable toilets\r\nwho devote themselves, in France, to the propagation of masterpieces,\r\nand if the truth must be told, he had often admired the copy much more\r\nthan the original. His physiognomy would have sufficiently indicated\r\nthat he was a shrewd and capable fellow, and in truth he had often sat\r\nup all night over a bristling bundle of accounts, and heard the cock\r\ncrow without a yawn. But Raphael and Titian and Rubens were a new kind\r\nof arithmetic, and they inspired our friend, for the first time in his\r\nlife, with a vague self-mistrust.\r\n\r\nAn observer with anything of an eye for national types would have had\r\nno difficulty in determining the local origin of this undeveloped\r\nconnoisseur, and indeed such an observer might have felt a certain\r\nhumorous relish of the almost ideal completeness with which he filled\r\nout the national mould. The gentleman on the divan was a powerful\r\nspecimen of an American. But he was not only a fine American; he was in\r\nthe first place, physically, a fine man. He appeared to possess that\r\nkind of health and strength which, when found in perfection, are the\r\nmost impressive\xe2\x80\x94the physical capital which the owner does nothing to\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ckeep up.\xe2\x80\x9d If he was a muscular Christian, it was quite without knowing\r\nit. If it was necessary to walk to a remote spot, he walked, but he had\r\nnever known himself to \xe2\x80\x9cexercise.\xe2\x80\x9d He had no theory with regard to cold\r\nbathing or the use of Indian clubs; he was neither an oarsman, a\r\nrifleman, nor a fencer\xe2\x80\x94he had never had time for these amusements\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nhe was quite unaware that the saddle is recommended for certain forms\r\nof indigestion. He was by inclination a temperate man; but he had\r\nsupped the night before his visit to the Louvre at the Caf\xc3\xa9\r\nAnglais\xe2\x80\x94someone had told him it was an experience not to be omitted\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nhe had slept none the less the sleep of the just. His usual attitude\r\nand carriage were of a rather relaxed and lounging kind, but when under\r\na special inspiration, he straightened himself, he looked like a\r\ngrenadier on parade. He never smoked. He had been assured\xe2\x80\x94such things\r\nare said\xe2\x80\x94that cigars were excellent for the health, and he was quite\r\ncapable of believing it; but he knew as little about tobacco as about\r\nhom\xc5\x93opathy. He had a very well-formed head, with a shapely, symmetrical\r\nbalance of the frontal and the occipital development, and a good deal\r\nof straight, rather dry brown hair. His complexion was brown, and his\r\nnose had a bold well-marked arch. His eye was of a clear, cold gray,\r\nand save for a rather abundant moustache he was clean-shaved. He had\r\nthe flat jaw and sinewy neck which are frequent in the American type;\r\nbut the traces of national origin are a matter of expression even more\r\nthan of feature, and it was in this respect that our friend\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncountenance was supremely eloquent. The discriminating observer we have\r\nbeen supposing might, however, perfectly have measured its\r\nexpressiveness, and yet have been at a loss to describe it. It had that\r\ntypical vagueness which is not vacuity, that blankness which is not\r\nsimplicity, that look of being committed to nothing in particular, of\r\nstanding in an attitude of general hospitality to the chances of life,\r\nof being very much at one\xe2\x80\x99s own disposal so characteristic of many\r\nAmerican faces. It was our friend\xe2\x80\x99s eye that chiefly told his story; an\r\neye in which innocence and experience were singularly blended. It was\r\nfull of contradictory suggestions, and though it was by no means the\r\nglowing orb of a hero of romance, you could find in it almost anything\r\nyou looked for. Frigid and yet friendly, frank yet cautious, shrewd yet\r\ncredulous, positive yet sceptical, confident yet shy, extremely\r\nintelligent and extremely good-humored, there was something vaguely\r\ndefiant in its concessions, and something profoundly reassuring in its\r\nreserve. The cut of this gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s moustache, with the two premature\r\nwrinkles in the cheek above it, and the fashion of his garments, in\r\nwhich an exposed shirt-front and a cerulean cravat played perhaps an\r\nobtrusive part, completed the conditions of his identity. We have\r\napproached him, perhaps, at a not especially favorable moment; he is by\r\nno means sitting for his portrait. But listless as he lounges there,\r\nrather baffled on the \xc3\xa6sthetic question, and guilty of the damning\r\nfault (as we have lately discovered it to be) of confounding the merit\r\nof the artist with that of his work (for he admires the squinting\r\nMadonna of the young lady with the boyish coiffure, because he thinks\r\nthe young lady herself uncommonly taking), he is a sufficiently\r\npromising acquaintance. Decision, salubrity, jocosity, prosperity, seem\r\nto hover within his call; he is evidently a practical man, but the idea\r\nin his case, has undefined and mysterious boundaries, which invite the\r\nimagination to bestir itself on his behalf.\r\n\r\nAs the little copyist proceeded with her work, she sent every now and\r\nthen a responsive glance toward her admirer. The cultivation of the\r\nfine arts appeared to necessitate, to her mind, a great deal of\r\nby-play, a great standing off with folded arms and head drooping from\r\nside to side, stroking of a dimpled chin with a dimpled hand, sighing\r\nand frowning and patting of the foot, fumbling in disordered tresses\r\nfor wandering hair-pins. These performances were accompanied by a\r\nrestless glance, which lingered longer than elsewhere upon the\r\ngentleman we have described. At last he rose abruptly, put on his hat,\r\nand approached the young lady. He placed himself before her picture and\r\nlooked at it for some moments, during which she pretended to be quite\r\nunconscious of his inspection. Then, addressing her with the single\r\nword which constituted the strength of his French vocabulary, and\r\nholding up one finger in a manner which appeared to him to illuminate\r\nhis meaning, \xe2\x80\x9c_Combien?_\xe2\x80\x9d he abruptly demanded.\r\n\r\nThe artist stared a moment, gave a little pout, shrugged her shoulders,\r\nput down her palette and brushes, and stood rubbing her hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much?\xe2\x80\x9d said our friend, in English. \xe2\x80\x9c_Combien?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur wishes to buy it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the young lady in French.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery pretty, _splendide. Combien?_\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the American.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt pleases monsieur, my little picture? It\xe2\x80\x99s a very beautiful\r\nsubject,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Madonna, yes; I am not a Catholic, but I want to buy it.\r\n_Combien?_ Write it here.\xe2\x80\x9d And he took a pencil from his pocket and\r\nshowed her the fly-leaf of his guide-book. She stood looking at him and\r\nscratching her chin with the pencil. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it not for sale?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\nAnd as she still stood reflecting, and looking at him with an eye\r\nwhich, in spite of her desire to treat this avidity of patronage as a\r\nvery old story, betrayed an almost touching incredulity, he was afraid\r\nhe had offended her. She was simply trying to look indifferent, and\r\nwondering how far she might go. \xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t made a mistake\xe2\x80\x94_pas\r\ninsult\xc3\xa9_, no?\xe2\x80\x9d her interlocutor continued. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you understand a\r\nlittle English?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young lady\xe2\x80\x99s aptitude for playing a part at short notice was\r\nremarkable. She fixed him with her conscious, perceptive eye and asked\r\nhim if he spoke no French. Then, \xe2\x80\x9c_Donnez!_\xe2\x80\x9d she said briefly, and took\r\nthe open guide-book. In the upper corner of the fly-leaf she traced a\r\nnumber, in a minute and extremely neat hand. Then she handed back the\r\nbook and took up her palette again.\r\n\r\nOur friend read the number: \xe2\x80\x9c2,000 francs.\xe2\x80\x9d He said nothing for a time,\r\nbut stood looking at the picture, while the copyist began actively to\r\ndabble with her paint. \xe2\x80\x9cFor a copy, isn\xe2\x80\x99t that a good deal?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked\r\nat last. \xe2\x80\x9c_Pas beaucoup?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young lady raised her eyes from her palette, scanned him from head\r\nto foot, and alighted with admirable sagacity upon exactly the right\r\nanswer. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, it\xe2\x80\x99s a good deal. But my copy has remarkable qualities,\r\nit is worth nothing less.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe gentleman in whom we are interested understood no French, but I\r\nhave said he was intelligent, and here is a good chance to prove it. He\r\napprehended, by a natural instinct, the meaning of the young woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nphrase, and it gratified him to think that she was so honest. Beauty,\r\ntalent, virtue; she combined everything! \xe2\x80\x9cBut you must finish it,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9c_finish_, you know;\xe2\x80\x9d and he pointed to the unpainted hand of the\r\nfigure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it shall be finished in perfection; in the perfection of\r\nperfections!\xe2\x80\x9d cried mademoiselle; and to confirm her promise, she\r\ndeposited a rosy blotch in the middle of the Madonna\xe2\x80\x99s cheek.\r\n\r\nBut the American frowned. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, too red, too red!\xe2\x80\x9d he rejoined. \xe2\x80\x9cHer\r\ncomplexion,\xe2\x80\x9d pointing to the Murillo, \xe2\x80\x9cis\xe2\x80\x94more delicate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDelicate? Oh, it shall be delicate, monsieur; delicate as S\xc3\xa8vres\r\n_biscuit_. I am going to tone that down; I know all the secrets of my\r\nart. And where will you allow us to send it to you? Your address?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy address? Oh yes!\xe2\x80\x9d And the gentleman drew a card from his\r\npocket-book and wrote something upon it. Then hesitating a moment he\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cIf I don\xe2\x80\x99t like it when it it\xe2\x80\x99s finished, you know, I shall not\r\nbe obliged to take it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young lady seemed as good a guesser as himself. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I am very sure\r\nthat monsieur is not capricious,\xe2\x80\x9d she said with a roguish smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCapricious?\xe2\x80\x9d And at this monsieur began to laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cOh no, I\xe2\x80\x99m not\r\ncapricious. I am very faithful. I am very constant. _Comprenez?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur is constant; I understand perfectly. It\xe2\x80\x99s a rare virtue. To\r\nrecompense you, you shall have your picture on the first possible day;\r\nnext week\xe2\x80\x94as soon as it is dry. I will take the card of monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nshe took it and read his name: \xe2\x80\x9cChristopher Newman.\xe2\x80\x9d Then she tried to\r\nrepeat it aloud, and laughed at her bad accent. \xe2\x80\x9cYour English names are\r\nso droll!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDroll?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Newman, laughing too. \xe2\x80\x9cDid you ever hear of\r\nChristopher Columbus?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Bien s\xc3\xbbr!_ He invented America; a very great man. And is he your\r\npatron?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy patron?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour patron-saint, in the calendar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, exactly; my parents named me for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur is American?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you see it?\xe2\x80\x9d monsieur inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you mean to carry my little picture away over there?\xe2\x80\x9d and she\r\nexplained her phrase with a gesture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I mean to buy a great many pictures\xe2\x80\x94_beaucoup, beaucoup_,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nChristopher Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe honor is not less for me,\xe2\x80\x9d the young lady answered, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I am sure\r\nmonsieur has a great deal of taste.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you must give me your card,\xe2\x80\x9d Newman said; \xe2\x80\x9cyour card, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young lady looked severe for an instant, and then said, \xe2\x80\x9cMy father\r\nwill wait upon you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut this time Mr. Newman\xe2\x80\x99s powers of divination were at fault. \xe2\x80\x9cYour\r\ncard, your address,\xe2\x80\x9d he simply repeated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy address?\xe2\x80\x9d said mademoiselle. Then with a little shrug, \xe2\x80\x9cHappily for\r\nyou, you are an American! It is the first time I ever gave my card to a\r\ngentleman.\xe2\x80\x9d And, taking from her pocket a rather greasy portemonnaie,\r\nshe extracted from it a small glazed visiting card, and presented the\r\nlatter to her patron. It was neatly inscribed in pencil, with a great\r\nmany flourishes, \xe2\x80\x9cMlle. No\xc3\xa9mie Nioche.\xe2\x80\x9d But Mr. Newman, unlike his\r\ncompanion, read the name with perfect gravity; all French names to him\r\nwere equally droll.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd precisely, here is my father, who has come to escort me home,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Mademoiselle No\xc3\xa9mie. \xe2\x80\x9cHe speaks English. He will arrange with\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d And she turned to welcome a little old gentleman who came\r\nshuffling up, peering over his spectacles at Newman.\r\n\r\nM. Nioche wore a glossy wig, of an unnatural color which overhung his\r\nlittle meek, white, vacant face, and left it hardly more expressive\r\nthan the unfeatured block upon which these articles are displayed in\r\nthe barber\xe2\x80\x99s window. He was an exquisite image of shabby gentility. His\r\nscant ill-made coat, desperately brushed, his darned gloves, his highly\r\npolished boots, his rusty, shapely hat, told the story of a person who\r\nhad \xe2\x80\x9chad losses\xe2\x80\x9d and who clung to the spirit of nice habits even though\r\nthe letter had been hopelessly effaced. Among other things M. Nioche\r\nhad lost courage. Adversity had not only ruined him, it had frightened\r\nhim, and he was evidently going through his remnant of life on tiptoe,\r\nfor fear of waking up the hostile fates. If this strange gentleman was\r\nsaying anything improper to his daughter, M. Nioche would entreat him\r\nhuskily, as a particular favor, to forbear; but he would admit at the\r\nsame time that he was very presumptuous to ask for particular favors.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur has bought my picture,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mademoiselle No\xc3\xa9mie. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfinished you\xe2\x80\x99ll carry it to him in a cab.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn a cab!\xe2\x80\x9d cried M. Nioche; and he stared, in a bewildered way, as if\r\nhe had seen the sun rising at midnight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you the young lady\xe2\x80\x99s father?\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cI think she said you\r\nspeak English.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak English\xe2\x80\x94yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man slowly rubbing his hands. \xe2\x80\x9cI will\r\nbring it in a cab.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay something, then,\xe2\x80\x9d cried his daughter. \xe2\x80\x9cThank him a little\xe2\x80\x94not too\r\nmuch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA little, my daughter, a little?\xe2\x80\x9d said M. Nioche perplexed. \xe2\x80\x9cHow\r\nmuch?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo thousand!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mademoiselle No\xc3\xa9mie. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t make a fuss or he\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ntake back his word.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo thousand!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the old man, and he began to fumble for his\r\nsnuff-box. He looked at Newman from head to foot; he looked at his\r\ndaughter and then at the picture. \xe2\x80\x9cTake care you don\xe2\x80\x99t spoil it!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncried almost sublimely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must go home,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mademoiselle No\xc3\xa9mie. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is a good day\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwork. Take care how you carry it!\xe2\x80\x9d And she began to put up her\r\nutensils.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can I thank you?\xe2\x80\x9d said M. Nioche. \xe2\x80\x9cMy English does not suffice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I spoke French as well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, good-naturedly. \xe2\x80\x9cYour\r\ndaughter is very clever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d and M. Nioche looked over his spectacles with tearful eyes\r\nand nodded several times with a world of sadness. \xe2\x80\x9cShe has had an\r\neducation\xe2\x80\x94_tr\xc3\xa8s-sup\xc3\xa9rieure!_ Nothing was spared. Lessons in pastel at\r\nten francs the lesson, lessons in oil at twelve francs. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t look\r\nat the francs then. She\xe2\x80\x99s an _artiste_, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo I understand you to say that you have had reverses?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReverses? Oh, sir, misfortunes\xe2\x80\x94terrible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnsuccessful in business, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery unsuccessful, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, never fear, you\xe2\x80\x99ll get on your legs again,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman cheerily.\r\n\r\nThe old man drooped his head on one side and looked at him with an\r\nexpression of pain, as if this were an unfeeling jest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does he say?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Mademoiselle No\xc3\xa9mie.\r\n\r\nM. Nioche took a pinch of snuff. \xe2\x80\x9cHe says I will make my fortune\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps he will help you. And what else?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe says thou art very clever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is very possible. You believe it yourself, my father?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBelieve it, my daughter? With this evidence!\xe2\x80\x9d And the old man turned\r\nafresh, with a staring, wondering homage, to the audacious daub on the\r\neasel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsk him, then, if he would not like to learn French.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo learn French?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo take lessons.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo take lessons, my daughter? From thee?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom me, my child? How should I give lessons?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Pas de raisons!_ Ask him immediately!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mademoiselle No\xc3\xa9mie, with\r\nsoft brevity.\r\n\r\nM. Nioche stood aghast, but under his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s eye he collected his\r\nwits, and, doing his best to assume an agreeable smile, he executed her\r\ncommands. \xe2\x80\x9cWould it please you to receive instruction in our beautiful\r\nlanguage?\xe2\x80\x9d he inquired, with an appealing quaver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo study French?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Newman, staring.\r\n\r\nM. Nioche pressed his finger-tips together and slowly raised his\r\nshoulders. \xe2\x80\x9cA little conversation!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConversation\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s it!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Mademoiselle No\xc3\xa9mie, who had caught\r\nthe word. \xe2\x80\x9cThe conversation of the best society.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur French conversation is famous, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d M. Nioche ventured to\r\ncontinue. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a great talent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut isn\xe2\x80\x99t it awfully difficult?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Newman, very simply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot to a man of _esprit_, like monsieur, an admirer of beauty in every\r\nform!\xe2\x80\x9d and M. Nioche cast a significant glance at his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nMadonna.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t fancy myself chattering French!\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman with a laugh.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet, I suppose that the more a man knows the better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur expresses that very happily. _H\xc3\xa9las, oui!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose it would help me a great deal, knocking about Paris, to know\r\nthe language.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, there are so many things monsieur must want to say: difficult\r\nthings!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything I want to say is difficult. But you give lessons?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoor M. Nioche was embarrassed; he smiled more appealingly. \xe2\x80\x9cI am not a\r\nregular professor,\xe2\x80\x9d he admitted. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t nevertheless tell him that\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m a professor,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to his daughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell him it\xe2\x80\x99s a very exceptional chance,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mademoiselle\r\nNo\xc3\xa9mie; \xe2\x80\x9can _homme du monde_\xe2\x80\x94one gentleman conversing with another!\r\nRemember what you are\xe2\x80\x94what you have been!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA teacher of languages in neither case! Much more formerly and much\r\nless to-day! And if he asks the price of the lessons?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe won\xe2\x80\x99t ask it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mademoiselle No\xc3\xa9mie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat he pleases, I may say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever! That\xe2\x80\x99s bad style.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf he asks, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMademoiselle No\xc3\xa9mie had put on her bonnet and was tying the ribbons.\r\nShe smoothed them out, with her soft little chin thrust forward. \xe2\x80\x9cTen\r\nfrancs,\xe2\x80\x9d she said quickly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my daughter! I shall never dare.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t dare, then! He won\xe2\x80\x99t ask till the end of the lessons, and then I\r\nwill make out the bill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. Nioche turned to the confiding foreigner again, and stood rubbing\r\nhis hands, with an air of seeming to plead guilty which was not\r\nintenser only because it was habitually so striking. It never occurred\r\nto Newman to ask him for a guarantee of his skill in imparting\r\ninstruction; he supposed of course M. Nioche knew his own language, and\r\nhis appealing forlornness was quite the perfection of what the\r\nAmerican, for vague reasons, had always associated with all elderly\r\nforeigners of the lesson-giving class. Newman had never reflected upon\r\nphilological processes. His chief impression with regard to\r\nascertaining those mysterious correlatives of his familiar English\r\nvocables which were current in this extraordinary city of Paris was,\r\nthat it was simply a matter of a good deal of unwonted and rather\r\nridiculous muscular effort on his own part. \xe2\x80\x9cHow did you learn\r\nEnglish?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked of the old man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I was young, before my miseries. Oh, I was wide awake, then. My\r\nfather was a great _commer\xc3\xa7ant_; he placed me for a year in a\r\ncounting-house in England. Some of it stuck to me; but much I have\r\nforgotten!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much French can I learn in a month?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does he say?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mademoiselle No\xc3\xa9mie.\r\n\r\nM. Nioche explained.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe will speak like an angel!\xe2\x80\x9d said his daughter.\r\n\r\nBut the native integrity which had been vainly exerted to secure M.\r\nNioche\xe2\x80\x99s commercial prosperity flickered up again. \xe2\x80\x9c_Dame_, monsieur!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe answered. \xe2\x80\x9cAll I can teach you!\xe2\x80\x9d And then, recovering himself at a\r\nsign from his daughter, \xe2\x80\x9cI will wait upon you at your hotel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, I should like to learn French,\xe2\x80\x9d Newman went on, with\r\ndemocratic confidingness. \xe2\x80\x9cHang me if I should ever have thought of it!\r\nI took for granted it was impossible. But if you learned my language,\r\nwhy shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I learn yours?\xe2\x80\x9d and his frank, friendly laugh drew the\r\nsting from the jest. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly, if we are going to converse, you know, you\r\nmust think of something cheerful to converse about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are very good, sir; I am overcome!\xe2\x80\x9d said M. Nioche, throwing out\r\nhis hands. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you have cheerfulness and happiness for two!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman more seriously. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must be bright and lively;\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s part of the bargain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. Nioche bowed, with his hand on his heart. \xe2\x80\x9cVery well, sir; you have\r\nalready made me lively.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome and bring me my picture then; I will pay you for it, and we will\r\ntalk about that. That will be a cheerful subject!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMademoiselle No\xc3\xa9mie had collected her accessories, and she gave the\r\nprecious Madonna in charge to her father, who retreated backwards out\r\nof sight, holding it at arm\xe2\x80\x99s-length and reiterating his obeisance. The\r\nyoung lady gathered her shawl about her like a perfect Parisienne, and\r\nit was with the smile of a Parisienne that she took leave of her\r\npatron.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nHe wandered back to the divan and seated himself on the other side, in\r\nview of the great canvas on which Paul Veronese had depicted the\r\nmarriage-feast of Cana. Wearied as he was he found the picture\r\nentertaining; it had an illusion for him; it satisfied his conception,\r\nwhich was ambitious, of what a splendid banquet should be. In the\r\nleft-hand corner of the picture is a young woman with yellow tresses\r\nconfined in a golden head-dress; she is bending forward and listening,\r\nwith the smile of a charming woman at a dinner-party, to her neighbor.\r\nNewman detected her in the crowd, admired her, and perceived that she\r\ntoo had her votive copyist\xe2\x80\x94a young man with his hair standing on end.\r\nSuddenly he became conscious of the germ of the mania of the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccollector;\xe2\x80\x9d he had taken the first step; why should he not go on? It\r\nwas only twenty minutes before that he had bought the first picture of\r\nhis life, and now he was already thinking of art-patronage as a\r\nfascinating pursuit. His reflections quickened his good-humor, and he\r\nwas on the point of approaching the young man with another \xe2\x80\x9c_Combien?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nTwo or three facts in this relation are noticeable, although the\r\nlogical chain which connects them may seem imperfect. He knew\r\nMademoiselle Nioche had asked too much; he bore her no grudge for doing\r\nso, and he was determined to pay the young man exactly the proper sum.\r\nAt this moment, however, his attention was attracted by a gentleman who\r\nhad come from another part of the room and whose manner was that of a\r\nstranger to the gallery, although he was equipped with neither\r\nguide-book nor opera-glass. He carried a white sun-umbrella, lined with\r\nblue silk, and he strolled in front of the Paul Veronese, vaguely\r\nlooking at it, but much too near to see anything but the grain of the\r\ncanvas. Opposite to Christopher Newman he paused and turned, and then\r\nour friend, who had been observing him, had a chance to verify a\r\nsuspicion aroused by an imperfect view of his face. The result of this\r\nlarger scrutiny was that he presently sprang to his feet, strode across\r\nthe room, and, with an outstretched hand, arrested the gentleman with\r\nthe blue-lined umbrella. The latter stared, but put out his hand at a\r\nventure. He was corpulent and rosy, and though his countenance, which\r\nwas ornamented with a beautiful flaxen beard, carefully divided in the\r\nmiddle and brushed outward at the sides, was not remarkable for\r\nintensity of expression, he looked like a person who would willingly\r\nshake hands with anyone. I know not what Newman thought of his face,\r\nbut he found a want of response in his grasp.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, come, come,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, laughing; \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t say, now, you don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nme\xe2\x80\x94if I have _not_ got a white parasol!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sound of his voice quickened the other\xe2\x80\x99s memory, his face expanded\r\nto its fullest capacity, and he also broke into a laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\r\nNewman\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll be blowed! Where in the world\xe2\x80\x94I declare\xe2\x80\x94who would have\r\nthought? You know you have changed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou haven\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot for the better, no doubt. When did you get here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree days ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t you let me know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had no idea _you_ were here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been here these six years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt must be eight or nine since we met.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething of that sort. We were very young.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was in St. Louis, during the war. You were in the army.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, not I! But you were.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe I was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou came out all right?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI came out with my legs and arms\xe2\x80\x94and with satisfaction. All that seems\r\nvery far away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how long have you been in Europe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeventeen days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFirst time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, very much so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMade your everlasting fortune?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChristopher Newman was silent a moment, and then with a tranquil smile\r\nhe answered, \xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd come to Paris to spend it, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we shall see. So they carry those parasols here\xe2\x80\x94the men-folk?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course they do. They\xe2\x80\x99re great things. They understand comfort out\r\nhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere do you buy them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnywhere, everywhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Tristram, I\xe2\x80\x99m glad to get hold of you. You can show me the\r\nropes. I suppose you know Paris inside out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Tristram gave a mellow smile of self-gratulation. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I guess\r\nthere are not many men that can show me much. I\xe2\x80\x99ll take care of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a pity you were not here a few minutes ago. I have just bought a\r\npicture. You might have put the thing through for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBought a picture?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Tristram, looking vaguely round at the\r\nwalls. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, do they sell them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean a copy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I see. These,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Tristram, nodding at the Titians and\r\nVandykes, \xe2\x80\x9cthese, I suppose, are originals.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope so,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want a copy of a copy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Tristram, mysteriously, \xe2\x80\x9cyou can never tell. They\r\nimitate, you know, so deucedly well. It\xe2\x80\x99s like the jewellers, with\r\ntheir false stones. Go into the Palais Royal, there; you see\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Imitation\xe2\x80\x99 on half the windows. The law obliges them to stick it on,\r\nyou know; but you can\xe2\x80\x99t tell the things apart. To tell the truth,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr.\r\nTristram continued, with a wry face, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t do much in pictures. I\r\nleave that to my wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you have got a wife?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t I mention it? She\xe2\x80\x99s a very nice woman; you must know her. She\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nup there in the Avenue d\xe2\x80\x99I\xc3\xa9na.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you are regularly fixed\xe2\x80\x94house and children and all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, a tip-top house and a couple of youngsters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Christopher Newman, stretching his arms a little, with a\r\nsigh, \xe2\x80\x9cI envy you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no! you don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mr. Tristram, giving him a little poke\r\nwith his parasol.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon; I do!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you won\xe2\x80\x99t, then, when\xe2\x80\x94when\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t certainly mean when I have seen your establishment?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you have seen Paris, my boy. You want to be your own master\r\nhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I have been my own master all my life, and I\xe2\x80\x99m tired of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, try Paris. How old are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThirty-six.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_C\xe2\x80\x99est le bel \xc3\xa2ge_, as they say here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does that mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt means that a man shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t send away his plate till he has eaten\r\nhis fill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll that? I have just made arrangements to take French lessons.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you don\xe2\x80\x99t want any lessons. You\xe2\x80\x99ll pick it up. I never took any.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you speak French as well as English?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetter!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Tristram, roundly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a splendid language. You\r\ncan say all sorts of bright things in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d said Christopher Newman, with an earnest desire for\r\ninformation, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you must be bright to begin with.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a bit; that\xe2\x80\x99s just the beauty of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two friends, as they exchanged these remarks, had remained standing\r\nwhere they met, and leaning against the rail which protected the\r\npictures. Mr. Tristram at last declared that he was overcome with\r\nfatigue and should be happy to sit down. Newman recommended in the\r\nhighest terms the great divan on which he had been lounging, and they\r\nprepared to seat themselves. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is a great place; isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nNewman, with ardor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGreat place, great place. Finest thing in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d And then,\r\nsuddenly, Mr. Tristram hesitated and looked about him. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose they\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t let you smoke here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman stared. \xe2\x80\x9cSmoke? I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. You know the regulations\r\nbetter than I.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI? I never was here before!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever! in six years?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe my wife dragged me here once when we first came to Paris,\r\nbut I never found my way back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you say you know Paris so well!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t call this Paris!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mr. Tristram, with assurance. \xe2\x80\x9cCome;\r\nlet\xe2\x80\x99s go over to the Palais Royal and have a smoke.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t smoke,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA drink, then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Mr. Tristram led his companion away. They passed through the\r\nglorious halls of the Louvre, down the staircases, along the cool, dim\r\ngalleries of sculpture, and out into the enormous court. Newman looked\r\nabout him as he went, but he made no comments, and it was only when\r\nthey at last emerged into the open air that he said to his friend, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nseems to me that in your place I should have come here once a week.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Tristram. \xe2\x80\x9cYou think so, but you\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have had time. You would always mean to go, but\r\nyou never would go. There\xe2\x80\x99s better fun than that, here in Paris.\r\nItaly\xe2\x80\x99s the place to see pictures; wait till you get there. There you\r\nhave to go; you can\xe2\x80\x99t do anything else. It\xe2\x80\x99s an awful country; you\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t get a decent cigar. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why I went in there, to-day; I\r\nwas strolling along, rather hard up for amusement. I sort of noticed\r\nthe Louvre as I passed, and I thought I would go in and see what was\r\ngoing on. But if I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t found you there I should have felt rather\r\nsold. Hang it, I don\xe2\x80\x99t care for pictures; I prefer the reality!\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nMr. Tristram tossed off this happy formula with an assurance which the\r\nnumerous class of persons suffering from an overdose of \xe2\x80\x9cculture\xe2\x80\x9d might\r\nhave envied him.\r\n\r\nThe two gentlemen proceeded along the Rue de Rivoli and into the Palais\r\nRoyal, where they seated themselves at one of the little tables\r\nstationed at the door of the caf\xc3\xa9 which projects into the great open\r\nquadrangle. The place was filled with people, the fountains were\r\nspouting, a band was playing, clusters of chairs were gathered beneath\r\nall the lime-trees, and buxom, white-capped nurses, seated along the\r\nbenches, were offering to their infant charges the amplest facilities\r\nfor nutrition. There was an easy, homely gaiety in the whole scene, and\r\nChristopher Newman felt that it was most characteristically Parisian.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now,\xe2\x80\x9d began Mr. Tristram, when they had tested the decoction which\r\nhe had caused to be served to them, \xe2\x80\x9cnow just give an account of\r\nyourself. What are your ideas, what are your plans, where have you come\r\nfrom and where are you going? In the first place, where are you\r\nstaying?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the Grand Hotel,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\nMr. Tristram puckered his plump visage. \xe2\x80\x9cThat won\xe2\x80\x99t do! You must\r\nchange.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChange?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, it\xe2\x80\x99s the finest hotel I ever was in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t want a \xe2\x80\x98fine\xe2\x80\x99 hotel; you want something small and quiet and\r\nelegant, where your bell is answered and you\xe2\x80\x94your person is\r\nrecognized.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey keep running to see if I have rung before I have touched the\r\nbell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman \xe2\x80\x9cand as for my person they are always bowing and\r\nscraping to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you are always tipping them. That\xe2\x80\x99s very bad style.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlways? By no means. A man brought me something yesterday, and then\r\nstood loafing in a beggarly manner. I offered him a chair and asked him\r\nif he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t sit down. Was that bad style?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he bolted, instantly. At any rate, the place amuses me. Hang your\r\nelegance, if it bores me. I sat in the court of the Grand Hotel last\r\nnight until two o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning, watching the coming and going,\r\nand the people knocking about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re easily pleased. But you can do as you choose\xe2\x80\x94a man in your\r\nshoes. You have made a pile of money, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have made enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHappy the man who can say that? Enough for what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEnough to rest awhile, to forget the confounded thing, to look about\r\nme, to see the world, to have a good time, to improve my mind, and, if\r\nthe fancy takes me, to marry a wife.\xe2\x80\x9d Newman spoke slowly, with a\r\ncertain dryness of accent and with frequent pauses. This was his\r\nhabitual mode of utterance, but it was especially marked in the words I\r\nhave just quoted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJupiter! There\xe2\x80\x99s a programme!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mr. Tristram. \xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, all\r\nthat takes money, especially the wife; unless indeed she gives it, as\r\nmine did. And what\xe2\x80\x99s the story? How have you done it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman had pushed his hat back from his forehead, folded his arms, and\r\nstretched his legs. He listened to the music, he looked about him at\r\nthe bustling crowd, at the plashing fountains, at the nurses and the\r\nbabies. \xe2\x80\x9cI have worked!\xe2\x80\x9d he answered at last.\r\n\r\nTristram looked at him for some moments, and allowed his placid eyes to\r\nmeasure his friend\xe2\x80\x99s generous longitude and rest upon his comfortably\r\ncontemplative face. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you worked at?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, at several things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you\xe2\x80\x99re a smart fellow, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman continued to look at the nurses and babies; they imparted to the\r\nscene a kind of primordial, pastoral simplicity. \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at\r\nlast, \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose I am.\xe2\x80\x9d And then, in answer to his companion\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninquiries, he related briefly his history since their last meeting. It\r\nwas an intensely Western story, and it dealt with enterprises which it\r\nwill be needless to introduce to the reader in detail. Newman had come\r\nout of the war with a brevet of brigadier-general, an honor which in\r\nthis case\xe2\x80\x94without invidious comparisons\xe2\x80\x94had lighted upon shoulders\r\namply competent to bear it. But though he could manage a fight, when\r\nneed was, Newman heartily disliked the business; his four years in the\r\narmy had left him with an angry, bitter sense of the waste of precious\r\nthings\xe2\x80\x94life and time and money and \xe2\x80\x9csmartness\xe2\x80\x9d and the early freshness\r\nof purpose; and he had addressed himself to the pursuits of peace with\r\npassionate zest and energy. He was of course as penniless when he\r\nplucked off his shoulder-straps as when he put them on, and the only\r\ncapital at his disposal was his dogged resolution and his lively\r\nperception of ends and means. Exertion and action were as natural to\r\nhim as respiration; a more completely healthy mortal had never trod the\r\nelastic soil of the West. His experience, moreover, was as wide as his\r\ncapacity; when he was fourteen years old, necessity had taken him by\r\nhis slim young shoulders and pushed him into the street, to earn that\r\nnight\xe2\x80\x99s supper. He had not earned it but he had earned the next\r\nnight\xe2\x80\x99s, and afterwards, whenever he had had none, it was because he\r\nhad gone without it to use the money for something else, a keener\r\npleasure or a finer profit. He had turned his hand, with his brain in\r\nit, to many things; he had been enterprising, in an eminent sense of\r\nthe term; he had been adventurous and even reckless, and he had known\r\nbitter failure as well as brilliant success; but he was a born\r\nexperimentalist, and he had always found something to enjoy in the\r\npressure of necessity, even when it was as irritating as the haircloth\r\nshirt of the medi\xc3\xa6val monk. At one time failure seemed inexorably his\r\nportion; ill-luck became his bed-fellow, and whatever he touched he\r\nturned, not to gold, but to ashes. His most vivid conception of a\r\nsupernatural element in the world\xe2\x80\x99s affairs had come to him once when\r\nthis pertinacity of misfortune was at its climax; there seemed to him\r\nsomething stronger in life than his own will. But the mysterious\r\nsomething could only be the devil, and he was accordingly seized with\r\nan intense personal enmity to this impertinent force. He had known what\r\nit was to have utterly exhausted his credit, to be unable to raise a\r\ndollar, and to find himself at nightfall in a strange city, without a\r\npenny to mitigate its strangeness. It was under these circumstances\r\nthat he made his entrance into San Francisco, the scene, subsequently,\r\nof his happiest strokes of fortune. If he did not, like Dr. Franklin in\r\nPhiladelphia, march along the street munching a penny-loaf, it was only\r\nbecause he had not the penny-loaf necessary to the performance. In his\r\ndarkest days he had had but one simple, practical impulse\xe2\x80\x94the desire,\r\nas he would have phrased it, to see the thing through. He did so at\r\nlast, buffeted his way into smooth waters, and made money largely. It\r\nmust be admitted, rather nakedly, that Christopher Newman\xe2\x80\x99s sole aim in\r\nlife had been to make money; what he had been placed in the world for\r\nwas, to his own perception, simply to wrest a fortune, the bigger the\r\nbetter, from defiant opportunity. This idea completely filled his\r\nhorizon and satisfied his imagination. Upon the uses of money, upon\r\nwhat one might do with a life into which one had succeeded in injecting\r\nthe golden stream, he had up to his thirty-fifth year very scantily\r\nreflected. Life had been for him an open game, and he had played for\r\nhigh stakes. He had won at last and carried off his winnings; and now\r\nwhat was he to do with them? He was a man to whom, sooner or later, the\r\nquestion was sure to present itself, and the answer to it belongs to\r\nour story. A vague sense that more answers were possible than his\r\nphilosophy had hitherto dreamt of had already taken possession of him,\r\nand it seemed softly and agreeably to deepen as he lounged in this\r\nbrilliant corner of Paris with his friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must confess,\xe2\x80\x9d he presently went on, \xe2\x80\x9cthat here I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel at all\r\nsmart. My remarkable talents seem of no use. I feel as simple as a\r\nlittle child, and a little child might take me by the hand and lead me\r\nabout.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be your little child,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tristram, jovially; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll take\r\nyou by the hand. Trust yourself to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am a good worker,\xe2\x80\x9d Newman continued, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I rather think I am a poor\r\nloafer. I have come abroad to amuse myself, but I doubt whether I know\r\nhow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that\xe2\x80\x99s easily learned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I may perhaps learn it, but I am afraid I shall never do it by\r\nrote. I have the best will in the world about it, but my genius doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlie in that direction. As a loafer I shall never be original, as I take\r\nit that you are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tristram, \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose I am original; like all those immoral\r\npictures in the Louvre.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBesides,\xe2\x80\x9d Newman continued, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to work at pleasure, any\r\nmore than I played at work. I want to take it easily. I feel\r\ndeliciously lazy, and I should like to spend six months as I am now,\r\nsitting under a tree and listening to a band. There\xe2\x80\x99s only one thing; I\r\nwant to hear some good music.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMusic and pictures! Lord, what refined tastes! You are what my wife\r\ncalls intellectual. I ain\xe2\x80\x99t, a bit. But we can find something better\r\nfor you to do than to sit under a tree. To begin with, you must come to\r\nthe club.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat club?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Occidental. You will see all the Americans there; all the best of\r\nthem, at least. Of course you play poker?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I say,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Newman, with energy, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are not going to lock me\r\nup in a club and stick me down at a card-table! I haven\xe2\x80\x99t come all this\r\nway for that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat the deuce _have_ you come for! You were glad enough to play poker\r\nin St. Louis, I recollect, when you cleaned me out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have come to see Europe, to get the best out of it I can. I want to\r\nsee all the great things, and do what the clever people do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe clever people? Much obliged. You set me down as a blockhead,\r\nthen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman was sitting sidewise in his chair, with his elbow on the back\r\nand his head leaning on his hand. Without moving he looked a while at\r\nhis companion with his dry, guarded, half-inscrutable, and yet\r\naltogether good-natured smile. \xe2\x80\x9cIntroduce me to your wife!\xe2\x80\x9d he said at\r\nlast.\r\n\r\nTristram bounced about in his chair. \xe2\x80\x9cUpon my word, I won\xe2\x80\x99t. She\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t want any help to turn up her nose at me, nor do you, either!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t turn up my nose at you, my dear fellow; nor at anyone, or\r\nanything. I\xe2\x80\x99m not proud, I assure you I\xe2\x80\x99m not proud. That\xe2\x80\x99s why I am\r\nwilling to take example by the clever people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if I\xe2\x80\x99m not the rose, as they say here, I have lived near it. I\r\ncan show you some clever people, too. Do you know General Packard? Do\r\nyou know C. P. Hatch? Do you know Miss Kitty Upjohn?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall be happy to make their acquaintance; I want to cultivate\r\nsociety.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTristram seemed restless and suspicious; he eyed his friend askance,\r\nand then, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you up to, anyway?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you going to\r\nwrite a book?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChristopher Newman twisted one end of his moustache a while, in\r\nsilence, and at last he made answer. \xe2\x80\x9cOne day, a couple of months ago,\r\nsomething very curious happened to me. I had come on to New York on\r\nsome important business; it was rather a long story\xe2\x80\x94a question of\r\ngetting ahead of another party, in a certain particular way, in the\r\nstock-market. This other party had once played me a very mean trick. I\r\nowed him a grudge, I felt awfully savage at the time, and I vowed that,\r\nwhen I got a chance, I would, figuratively speaking, put his nose out\r\nof joint. There was a matter of some sixty thousand dollars at stake.\r\nIf I put it out of his way, it was a blow the fellow would feel, and he\r\nreally deserved no quarter. I jumped into a hack and went about my\r\nbusiness, and it was in this hack\xe2\x80\x94this immortal, historical hack\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nthe curious thing I speak of occurred. It was a hack like any other,\r\nonly a trifle dirtier, with a greasy line along the top of the drab\r\ncushions, as if it had been used for a great many Irish funerals. It is\r\npossible I took a nap; I had been traveling all night, and though I was\r\nexcited with my errand, I felt the want of sleep. At all events I woke\r\nup suddenly, from a sleep or from a kind of a reverie, with the most\r\nextraordinary feeling in the world\xe2\x80\x94a mortal disgust for the thing I was\r\ngoing to do. It came upon me like _that!_\xe2\x80\x9d and he snapped his\r\nfingers\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cas abruptly as an old wound that begins to ache. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntell the meaning of it; I only felt that I loathed the whole business\r\nand wanted to wash my hands of it. The idea of losing that sixty\r\nthousand dollars, of letting it utterly slide and scuttle and never\r\nhearing of it again, seemed the sweetest thing in the world. And all\r\nthis took place quite independently of my will, and I sat watching it\r\nas if it were a play at the theatre. I could feel it going on inside of\r\nme. You may depend upon it that there are things going on inside of us\r\nthat we understand mighty little about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJupiter! you make my flesh creep!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Tristram. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd while you sat\r\nin your hack, watching the play, as you call it, the other man marched\r\nin and bagged your sixty thousand dollars?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not the least idea. I hope so, poor devil! but I never found\r\nout. We pulled up in front of the place I was going to in Wall Street,\r\nbut I sat still in the carriage, and at last the driver scrambled down\r\noff his seat to see whether his carriage had not turned into a hearse.\r\nI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have got out, any more than if I had been a corpse. What was\r\nthe matter with me? Momentary idiocy, you\xe2\x80\x99ll say. What I wanted to get\r\nout of was Wall Street. I told the man to drive down to the Brooklyn\r\nferry and to cross over. When we were over, I told him to drive me out\r\ninto the country. As I had told him originally to drive for dear life\r\ndown town, I suppose he thought me insane. Perhaps I was, but in that\r\ncase I am insane still. I spent the morning looking at the first green\r\nleaves on Long Island. I was sick of business; I wanted to throw it all\r\nup and break off short; I had money enough, or if I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t I ought to\r\nhave. I seemed to feel a new man inside my old skin, and I longed for a\r\nnew world. When you want a thing so very badly you had better treat\r\nyourself to it. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand the matter, not in the least; but I\r\ngave the old horse the bridle and let him find his way. As soon as I\r\ncould get out of the game I sailed for Europe. That is how I come to be\r\nsitting here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to have bought up that hack,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tristram; \xe2\x80\x9cit isn\xe2\x80\x99t a\r\nsafe vehicle to have about. And you have really sold out, then; you\r\nhave retired from business?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have made over my hand to a friend; when I feel disposed, I can take\r\nup the cards again. I dare say that a twelvemonth hence the operation\r\nwill be reversed. The pendulum will swing back again. I shall be\r\nsitting in a gondola or on a dromedary, and all of a sudden I shall\r\nwant to clear out. But for the present I am perfectly free. I have even\r\nbargained that I am to receive no business letters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s a real _caprice de prince_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tristram. \xe2\x80\x9cI back out; a\r\npoor devil like me can\xe2\x80\x99t help you to spend such very magnificent\r\nleisure as that. You should get introduced to the crowned heads.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman looked at him a moment, and then, with his easy smile, \xe2\x80\x9cHow does\r\none do it?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, I like that!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Tristram. \xe2\x80\x9cIt shows you are in earnest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I am in earnest. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t I say I wanted the best? I know the\r\nbest can\xe2\x80\x99t be had for mere money, but I rather think money will do a\r\ngood deal. In addition, I am willing to take a good deal of trouble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not bashful, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t the least idea. I want the biggest kind of entertainment a\r\nman can get. People, places, art, nature, everything! I want to see the\r\ntallest mountains, and the bluest lakes, and the finest pictures and\r\nthe handsomest churches, and the most celebrated men, and the most\r\nbeautiful women.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSettle down in Paris, then. There are no mountains that I know of, and\r\nthe only lake is in the Bois du Boulogne, and not particularly blue.\r\nBut there is everything else: plenty of pictures and churches, no end\r\nof celebrated men, and several beautiful women.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I can\xe2\x80\x99t settle down in Paris at this season, just as summer is\r\ncoming on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, for the summer go up to Trouville.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is Trouville?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe French Newport. Half the Americans go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it anywhere near the Alps?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout as near as Newport is to the Rocky Mountains.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I want to see Mont Blanc,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, \xe2\x80\x9cand Amsterdam, and the\r\nRhine, and a lot of places. Venice in particular. I have great ideas\r\nabout Venice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Tristram, rising, \xe2\x80\x9cI see I shall have to introduce you\r\nto my wife!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nHe performed this ceremony on the following day, when, by appointment,\r\nChristopher Newman went to dine with him. Mr. and Mrs. Tristram lived\r\nbehind one of those chalk-colored fa\xc3\xa7ades which decorate with their\r\npompous sameness the broad avenues manufactured by Baron Haussmann in\r\nthe neighborhood of the Arc de Triomphe. Their apartment was rich in\r\nthe modern conveniences, and Tristram lost no time in calling his\r\nvisitor\xe2\x80\x99s attention to their principal household treasures, the\r\ngas-lamps and the furnace-holes. \xe2\x80\x9cWhenever you feel homesick,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou must come up here. We\xe2\x80\x99ll stick you down before a register, under a\r\ngood big burner, and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you will soon get over your homesickness,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Tristram.\r\n\r\nHer husband stared; his wife often had a tone which he found\r\ninscrutable he could not tell for his life whether she was in jest or\r\nin earnest. The truth is that circumstances had done much to cultivate\r\nin Mrs. Tristram a marked tendency to irony. Her taste on many points\r\ndiffered from that of her husband, and though she made frequent\r\nconcessions it must be confessed that her concessions were not always\r\ngraceful. They were founded upon a vague project she had of some day\r\ndoing something very positive, something a trifle passionate. What she\r\nmeant to do she could by no means have told you; but meanwhile,\r\nnevertheless, she was buying a good conscience, by instalments.\r\n\r\nIt should be added, without delay, to anticipate misconception, that\r\nher little scheme of independence did not definitely involve the\r\nassistance of another person, of the opposite sex; she was not saving\r\nup virtue to cover the expenses of a flirtation. For this there were\r\nvarious reasons. To begin with, she had a very plain face and she was\r\nentirely without illusions as to her appearance. She had taken its\r\nmeasure to a hair\xe2\x80\x99s breadth, she knew the worst and the best, she had\r\naccepted herself. It had not been, indeed, without a struggle. As a\r\nyoung girl she had spent hours with her back to her mirror, crying her\r\neyes out; and later she had from desperation and bravado adopted the\r\nhabit of proclaiming herself the most ill-favored of women, in order\r\nthat she might\xe2\x80\x94as in common politeness was inevitable\xe2\x80\x94be contradicted\r\nand reassured. It was since she had come to live in Europe that she had\r\nbegun to take the matter philosophically. Her observation, acutely\r\nexercised here, had suggested to her that a woman\xe2\x80\x99s first duty is not\r\nto be beautiful, but to be pleasing, and she encountered so many women\r\nwho pleased without beauty that she began to feel that she had\r\ndiscovered her mission. She had once heard an enthusiastic musician,\r\nout of patience with a gifted bungler, declare that a fine voice is\r\nreally an obstacle to singing properly; and it occurred to her that it\r\nmight perhaps be equally true that a beautiful face is an obstacle to\r\nthe acquisition of charming manners. Mrs. Tristram, then, undertook to\r\nbe exquisitely agreeable, and she brought to the task a really touching\r\ndevotion. How well she would have succeeded I am unable to say;\r\nunfortunately she broke off in the middle. Her own excuse was the want\r\nof encouragement in her immediate circle. But I am inclined to think\r\nthat she had not a real genius for the matter, or she would have\r\npursued the charming art for itself. The poor lady was very incomplete.\r\nShe fell back upon the harmonies of the toilet, which she thoroughly\r\nunderstood, and contented herself with dressing in perfection. She\r\nlived in Paris, which she pretended to detest, because it was only in\r\nParis that one could find things to exactly suit one\xe2\x80\x99s complexion.\r\nBesides out of Paris it was always more or less of a trouble to get\r\nten-button gloves. When she railed at this serviceable city and you\r\nasked her where she would prefer to reside, she returned some very\r\nunexpected answer. She would say in Copenhagen, or in Barcelona;\r\nhaving, while making the tour of Europe, spent a couple of days at each\r\nof these places. On the whole, with her poetic furbelows and her\r\nmisshapen, intelligent little face, she was, when you knew her, a\r\ndecidedly interesting woman. She was naturally shy, and if she had been\r\nborn a beauty, she would (having no vanity) probably have remained shy.\r\nNow, she was both diffident and importunate; extremely reserved\r\nsometimes with her friends, and strangely expansive with strangers. She\r\ndespised her husband; despised him too much, for she had been perfectly\r\nat liberty not to marry him. She had been in love with a clever man who\r\nhad slighted her, and she had married a fool in the hope that this\r\nthankless wit, reflecting on it, would conclude that she had no\r\nappreciation of merit, and that he had flattered himself in supposing\r\nthat she cared for his own. Restless, discontented, visionary, without\r\npersonal ambitions, but with a certain avidity of imagination, she was,\r\nas I have said before, eminently incomplete. She was full\xe2\x80\x94both for good\r\nand for ill\xe2\x80\x94of beginnings that came to nothing; but she had\r\nnevertheless, morally, a spark of the sacred fire.\r\n\r\nNewman was fond, under all circumstances, of the society of women, and\r\nnow that he was out of his native element and deprived of his habitual\r\ninterests, he turned to it for compensation. He took a great fancy to\r\nMrs. Tristram; she frankly repaid it, and after their first meeting he\r\npassed a great many hours in her drawing-room. After two or three talks\r\nthey were fast friends. Newman\xe2\x80\x99s manner with women was peculiar, and it\r\nrequired some ingenuity on a lady\xe2\x80\x99s part to discover that he admired\r\nher. He had no gallantry, in the usual sense of the term; no\r\ncompliments, no graces, no speeches. Very fond of what is called\r\nchaffing, in his dealings with men, he never found himself on a sofa\r\nbeside a member of the softer sex without feeling extremely serious. He\r\nwas not shy, and so far as awkwardness proceeds from a struggle with\r\nshyness, he was not awkward; grave, attentive, submissive, often\r\nsilent, he was simply swimming in a sort of rapture of respect. This\r\nemotion was not at all theoretic, it was not even in a high degree\r\nsentimental; he had thought very little about the \xe2\x80\x9cposition\xe2\x80\x9d of women,\r\nand he was not familiar either sympathetically or otherwise, with the\r\nimage of a President in petticoats. His attitude was simply the flower\r\nof his general good-nature, and a part of his instinctive and genuinely\r\ndemocratic assumption of everyone\xe2\x80\x99s right to lead an easy life. If a\r\nshaggy pauper had a right to bed and board and wages and a vote, women,\r\nof course, who were weaker than paupers, and whose physical tissue was\r\nin itself an appeal, should be maintained, sentimentally, at the public\r\nexpense. Newman was willing to be taxed for this purpose, largely, in\r\nproportion to his means. Moreover, many of the common traditions with\r\nregard to women were with him fresh personal impressions; he had never\r\nread a novel! He had been struck with their acuteness, their subtlety,\r\ntheir tact, their felicity of judgment. They seemed to him exquisitely\r\norganized. If it is true that one must always have in one\xe2\x80\x99s work here\r\nbelow a religion, or at least an ideal, of some sort, Newman found his\r\nmetaphysical inspiration in a vague acceptance of final responsibility\r\nto some illumined feminine brow.\r\n\r\nHe spent a great deal of time in listening to advice from Mrs.\r\nTristram; advice, it must be added, for which he had never asked. He\r\nwould have been incapable of asking for it, for he had no perception of\r\ndifficulties, and consequently no curiosity about remedies. The complex\r\nParisian world about him seemed a very simple affair; it was an\r\nimmense, amazing spectacle, but it neither inflamed his imagination nor\r\nirritated his curiosity. He kept his hands in his pockets, looked on\r\ngood-humoredly, desired to miss nothing important, observed a great\r\nmany things narrowly, and never reverted to himself. Mrs. Tristram\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cadvice\xe2\x80\x9d was a part of the show, and a more entertaining element, in\r\nher abundant gossip, than the others. He enjoyed her talking about\r\nhimself; it seemed a part of her beautiful ingenuity; but he never made\r\nan application of anything she said, or remembered it when he was away\r\nfrom her. For herself, she appropriated him; he was the most\r\ninteresting thing she had had to think about in many a month. She\r\nwished to do something with him\xe2\x80\x94she hardly knew what. There was so much\r\nof him; he was so rich and robust, so easy, friendly, well-disposed,\r\nthat he kept her fancy constantly on the alert. For the present, the\r\nonly thing she could do was to like him. She told him that he was\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chorribly Western,\xe2\x80\x9d but in this compliment the adverb was tinged with\r\ninsincerity. She led him about with her, introduced him to fifty\r\npeople, and took extreme satisfaction in her conquest. Newman accepted\r\nevery proposal, shook hands universally and promiscuously, and seemed\r\nequally unfamiliar with trepidation or with elation. Tom Tristram\r\ncomplained of his wife\xe2\x80\x99s avidity, and declared that he could never have\r\na clear five minutes with his friend. If he had known how things were\r\ngoing to turn out, he never would have brought him to the Avenue\r\nd\xe2\x80\x99I\xc3\xa9na. The two men, formerly, had not been intimate, but Newman\r\nremembered his earlier impression of his host, and did Mrs. Tristram,\r\nwho had by no means taken him into her confidence, but whose secret he\r\npresently discovered, the justice to admit that her husband was a\r\nrather degenerate mortal. At twenty-five he had been a good fellow, and\r\nin this respect he was unchanged; but of a man of his age one expected\r\nsomething more. People said he was sociable, but this was as much a\r\nmatter of course as for a dipped sponge to expand; and it was not a\r\nhigh order of sociability. He was a great gossip and tattler, and to\r\nproduce a laugh would hardly have spared the reputation of his aged\r\nmother. Newman had a kindness for old memories, but he found it\r\nimpossible not to perceive that Tristram was nowadays a very light\r\nweight. His only aspirations were to hold out at poker, at his club, to\r\nknow the names of all the _cocottes_, to shake hands all round, to ply\r\nhis rosy gullet with truffles and champagne, and to create\r\nuncomfortable eddies and obstructions among the constituent atoms of\r\nthe American colony. He was shamefully idle, spiritless, sensual,\r\nsnobbish. He irritated our friend by the tone of his allusions to their\r\nnative country, and Newman was at a loss to understand why the United\r\nStates were not good enough for Mr. Tristram. He had never been a very\r\nconscious patriot, but it vexed him to see them treated as little\r\nbetter than a vulgar smell in his friend\xe2\x80\x99s nostrils, and he finally\r\nbroke out and swore that they were the greatest country in the world,\r\nthat they could put all Europe into their breeches\xe2\x80\x99 pockets, and that\r\nan American who spoke ill of them ought to be carried home in irons and\r\ncompelled to live in Boston. (This, for Newman was putting it very\r\nvindictively.) Tristram was a comfortable man to snub, he bore no\r\nmalice, and he continued to insist on Newman\xe2\x80\x99s finishing his evening at\r\nthe Occidental Club.\r\n\r\nChristopher Newman dined several times in the Avenue d\xe2\x80\x99I\xc3\xa9na, and his\r\nhost always proposed an early adjournment to this institution. Mrs.\r\nTristram protested, and declared that her husband exhausted his\r\ningenuity in trying to displease her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, I never try, my love,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cI know you loathe me quite\r\nenough when I take my chance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman hated to see a husband and wife on these terms, and he was sure\r\none or other of them must be very unhappy. He knew it was not Tristram.\r\nMrs. Tristram had a balcony before her windows, upon which, during the\r\nJune evenings, she was fond of sitting, and Newman used frankly to say\r\nthat he preferred the balcony to the club. It had a fringe of perfumed\r\nplants in tubs, and enabled you to look up the broad street and see the\r\nArch of Triumph vaguely massing its heroic sculptures in the summer\r\nstarlight. Sometimes Newman kept his promise of following Mr. Tristram,\r\nin half an hour, to the Occidental, and sometimes he forgot it. His\r\nhostess asked him a great many questions about himself, but on this\r\nsubject he was an indifferent talker. He was not what is called\r\nsubjective, though when he felt that her interest was sincere, he made\r\nan almost heroic attempt to be. He told her a great many things he had\r\ndone, and regaled her with anecdotes of Western life; she was from\r\nPhiladelphia, and with her eight years in Paris, talked of herself as a\r\nlanguid Oriental. But some other person was always the hero of the\r\ntale, by no means always to his advantage; and Newman\xe2\x80\x99s own emotions\r\nwere but scantily chronicled. She had an especial wish to know whether\r\nhe had ever been in love\xe2\x80\x94seriously, passionately\xe2\x80\x94and, failing to gather\r\nany satisfaction from his allusions, she at last directly inquired. He\r\nhesitated a while, and at last he said, \xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d She declared that she was\r\ndelighted to hear it, as it confirmed her private conviction that he\r\nwas a man of no feeling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, very gravely. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think so? How do you\r\nrecognize a man of feeling?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t make out,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Tristram, \xe2\x80\x9cwhether you are very simple or\r\nvery deep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very deep. That\xe2\x80\x99s a fact.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe that if I were to tell you with a certain air that you have\r\nno feeling, you would implicitly believe me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA certain air?\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cTry it and see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou would believe me, but you would not care,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Tristram.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have got it all wrong. I should care immensely, but I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbelieve you. The fact is I have never had time to feel things. I have\r\nhad to _do_ them, to make myself felt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can imagine that you may have done that tremendously, sometimes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, there\xe2\x80\x99s no mistake about that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you are in a fury it can\xe2\x80\x99t be pleasant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am never in a fury.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAngry, then, or displeased.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am never angry, and it is so long since I have been displeased that\r\nI have quite forgotten it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Tristram, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you are never angry. A man\r\nought to be angry sometimes, and you are neither good enough nor bad\r\nenough always to keep your temper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI lose it perhaps once in five years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe time is coming round, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said his hostess. \xe2\x80\x9cBefore I have\r\nknown you six months I shall see you in a fine fury.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean to put me into one?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should not be sorry. You take things too coolly. It exasperates me.\r\nAnd then you are too happy. You have what must be the most agreeable\r\nthing in the world, the consciousness of having bought your pleasure\r\nbeforehand and paid for it. You have not a day of reckoning staring you\r\nin the face. Your reckonings are over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I suppose I am happy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, meditatively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have been odiously successful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuccessful in copper,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, \xe2\x80\x9conly so-so in railroads, and a\r\nhopeless fizzle in oil.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is very disagreeable to know how Americans have made their money.\r\nNow you have the world before you. You have only to enjoy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I suppose I am very well off,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly I am tired of\r\nhaving it thrown up at me. Besides, there are several drawbacks. I am\r\nnot intellectual.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne doesn\xe2\x80\x99t expect it of you,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Tristram answered. Then in a\r\nmoment, \xe2\x80\x9cBesides, you are!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I mean to have a good time, whether or no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\nnot cultivated, I am not even educated; I know nothing about history,\r\nor art, or foreign tongues, or any other learned matters. But I am not\r\na fool, either, and I shall undertake to know something about Europe by\r\nthe time I have done with it. I feel something under my ribs here,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nadded in a moment, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I can\xe2\x80\x99t explain\xe2\x80\x94a sort of a mighty hankering,\r\na desire to stretch out and haul in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBravo!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Tristram, \xe2\x80\x9cthat is very fine. You are the great\r\nWestern Barbarian, stepping forth in his innocence and might, gazing a\r\nwhile at this poor effete Old World and then swooping down on it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, come,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cI am not a barbarian, by a good deal. I am\r\nvery much the reverse. I have seen barbarians; I know what they are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mean that you are a Comanche chief, or that you wear a blanket\r\nand feathers. There are different shades.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am a highly civilized man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cI stick to that. If you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t believe it, I should like to prove it to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Tristram was silent a while. \xe2\x80\x9cI should like to make you prove it,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe said, at last. \xe2\x80\x9cI should like to put you in a difficult place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat has a little conceited sound!\xe2\x80\x9d his companion rejoined.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, \xe2\x80\x9cI have a very good opinion of myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I could put it to the test. Give me time and I will.\xe2\x80\x9d And Mrs.\r\nTristram remained silent for some time afterwards, as if she was trying\r\nto keep her pledge. It did not appear that evening that she succeeded;\r\nbut as he was rising to take his leave she passed suddenly, as she was\r\nvery apt to do, from the tone of unsparing persiflage to that of almost\r\ntremulous sympathy. \xe2\x80\x9cSpeaking seriously,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI believe in you,\r\nMr. Newman. You flatter my patriotism.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour patriotism?\xe2\x80\x9d Christopher demanded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven so. It would take too long to explain, and you probably would not\r\nunderstand. Besides, you might take it\xe2\x80\x94really, you might take it for a\r\ndeclaration. But it has nothing to do with you personally; it\xe2\x80\x99s what\r\nyou represent. Fortunately you don\xe2\x80\x99t know all that, or your conceit\r\nwould increase insufferably.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman stood staring and wondering what under the sun he \xe2\x80\x9crepresented.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForgive all my meddlesome chatter and forget my advice. It is very\r\nsilly in me to undertake to tell you what to do. When you are\r\nembarrassed, do as you think best, and you will do very well. When you\r\nare in a difficulty, judge for yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall remember everything you have told me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are\r\nso many forms and ceremonies over here\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForms and ceremonies are what I mean, of course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, but I want to observe them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t I as good a\r\nright as another? They don\xe2\x80\x99t scare me, and you needn\xe2\x80\x99t give me leave to\r\nviolate them. I won\xe2\x80\x99t take it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is not what I mean. I mean, observe them in your own way. Settle\r\nnice questions for yourself. Cut the knot or untie it, as you choose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I am sure I shall never fumble over it!\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\nThe next time that he dined in the Avenue d\xe2\x80\x99I\xc3\xa9na was a Sunday, a day on\r\nwhich Mr. Tristram left the cards unshuffled, so that there was a trio\r\nin the evening on the balcony. The talk was of many things, and at last\r\nMrs. Tristram suddenly observed to Christopher Newman that it was high\r\ntime he should take a wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen to her; she has the audacity!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tristram, who on Sunday\r\nevenings was always rather acrimonious.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose you have made up your mind not to marry?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs.\r\nTristram continued.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeaven forbid!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cI am sternly resolved on it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very easy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tristram; \xe2\x80\x9cfatally easy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, I suppose you do not mean to wait till you are fifty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the contrary, I am in a great hurry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne would never suppose it. Do you expect a lady to come and propose\r\nto you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; I am willing to propose. I think a great deal about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me some of your thoughts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, slowly, \xe2\x80\x9cI want to marry very well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarry a woman of sixty, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tristram.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Well\xe2\x80\x99 in what sense?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn every sense. I shall be hard to please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must remember that, as the French proverb says, the most beautiful\r\ngirl in the world can give but what she has.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince you ask me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, \xe2\x80\x9cI will say frankly that I want\r\nextremely to marry. It is time, to begin with: before I know it I shall\r\nbe forty. And then I\xe2\x80\x99m lonely and helpless and dull. But if I marry\r\nnow, so long as I didn\xe2\x80\x99t do it in hot haste when I was twenty, I must\r\ndo it with my eyes open. I want to do the thing in handsome style. I do\r\nnot only want to make no mistakes, but I want to make a great hit. I\r\nwant to take my pick. My wife must be a magnificent woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Voil\xc3\xa0 ce qui s\xe2\x80\x99appelle parler!_\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs. Tristram.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I have thought an immense deal about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you think too much. The best thing is simply to fall in love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I find the woman who pleases me, I shall love her enough. My wife\r\nshall be very comfortable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are superb! There\xe2\x80\x99s a chance for the magnificent women.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not fair.\xe2\x80\x9d Newman rejoined. \xe2\x80\x9cYou draw a fellow out and put him\r\noff guard, and then you laugh at him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI assure you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Tristram, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I am very serious. To prove\r\nit, I will make you a proposal. Should you like me, as they say here,\r\nto marry you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo hunt up a wife for me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is already found. I will bring you together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, come,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tristram, \xe2\x80\x9cwe don\xe2\x80\x99t keep a matrimonial bureau. He will\r\nthink you want your commission.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPresent me to a woman who comes up to my notions,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\r\nwill marry her tomorrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have a strange tone about it, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t quite understand you. I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t suppose you would be so coldblooded and calculating.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman was silent a while. \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, at last, \xe2\x80\x9cI want a great\r\nwoman. I stick to that. That\xe2\x80\x99s one thing I _can_ treat myself to, and\r\nif it is to be had I mean to have it. What else have I toiled and\r\nstruggled for, all these years? I have succeeded, and now what am I to\r\ndo with my success? To make it perfect, as I see it, there must be a\r\nbeautiful woman perched on the pile, like a statue on a monument. She\r\nmust be as good as she is beautiful, and as clever as she is good. I\r\ncan give my wife a good deal, so I am not afraid to ask a good deal\r\nmyself. She shall have everything a woman can desire; I shall not even\r\nobject to her being too good for me; she may be cleverer and wiser than\r\nI can understand, and I shall only be the better pleased. I want to\r\npossess, in a word, the best article in the market.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t you tell a fellow all this at the outset?\xe2\x80\x9d Tristram\r\ndemanded. \xe2\x80\x9cI have been trying so to make you fond of _me!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is very interesting,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Tristram. \xe2\x80\x9cI like to see a man\r\nknow his own mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have known mine for a long time,\xe2\x80\x9d Newman went on. \xe2\x80\x9cI made up my mind\r\ntolerably early in life that a beautiful wife was the thing best worth\r\nhaving, here below. It is the greatest victory over circumstances. When\r\nI say beautiful, I mean beautiful in mind and in manners, as well as in\r\nperson. It is a thing every man has an equal right to; he may get it if\r\nhe can. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to be born with certain faculties, on purpose;\r\nhe needs only to be a man. Then he needs only to use his will, and such\r\nwits as he has, and to try.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt strikes me that your marriage is to be rather a matter of vanity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it is certain,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, \xe2\x80\x9cthat if people notice my wife and\r\nadmire her, I shall be mightily tickled.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter this,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs. Tristram, \xe2\x80\x9ccall any man modest!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut none of them will admire her so much as I.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see you have a taste for splendor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman hesitated a little; and then, \xe2\x80\x9cI honestly believe I have!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I suppose you have already looked about you a good deal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA good deal, according to opportunity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you have seen nothing that satisfied you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, half reluctantly, \xe2\x80\x9cI am bound to say in honesty that\r\nI have seen nothing that really satisfied me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou remind me of the heroes of the French romantic poets, Rolla and\r\nFortunio and all those other insatiable gentlemen for whom nothing in\r\nthis world was handsome enough. But I see you are in earnest, and I\r\nshould like to help you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho the deuce is it, darling, that you are going to put upon him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nTristram cried. \xe2\x80\x9cWe know a good many pretty girls, thank Heaven, but\r\nmagnificent women are not so common.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you any objections to a foreigner?\xe2\x80\x9d his wife continued,\r\naddressing Newman, who had tilted back his chair and, with his feet on\r\na bar of the balcony railing and his hands in his pockets, was looking\r\nat the stars.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo Irish need apply,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tristram.\r\n\r\nNewman meditated a while. \xe2\x80\x9cAs a foreigner, no,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last; \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nhave no prejudices.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear fellow, you have no suspicions!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Tristram. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow what terrible customers these foreign women are; especially the\r\n\xe2\x80\x98magnificent\xe2\x80\x99 ones. How should you like a fair Circassian, with a\r\ndagger in her belt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman administered a vigorous slap to his knee. \xe2\x80\x9cI would marry a\r\nJapanese, if she pleased me,\xe2\x80\x9d he affirmed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe had better confine ourselves to Europe,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Tristram. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nonly thing is, then, that the person be in herself to your taste?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is going to offer you an unappreciated governess!\xe2\x80\x9d Tristram\r\ngroaned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAssuredly. I won\xe2\x80\x99t deny that, other things being equal, I should\r\nprefer one of my own countrywomen. We should speak the same language,\r\nand that would be a comfort. But I am not afraid of a foreigner.\r\nBesides, I rather like the idea of taking in Europe, too. It enlarges\r\nthe field of selection. When you choose from a greater number, you can\r\nbring your choice to a finer point!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou talk like Sardanapalus!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Tristram.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou say all this to the right person,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman\xe2\x80\x99s hostess. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nhappen to number among my friends the loveliest woman in the world.\r\nNeither more nor less. I don\xe2\x80\x99t say a very charming person or a very\r\nestimable woman or a very great beauty; I say simply the loveliest\r\nwoman in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe deuce!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Tristram, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have kept very quiet about her. Were\r\nyou afraid of me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have seen her,\xe2\x80\x9d said his wife, \xe2\x80\x9cbut you have no perception of such\r\nmerit as Claire\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, her name is Claire? I give it up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes your friend wish to marry?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot in the least. It is for you to make her change her mind. It will\r\nnot be easy; she has had one husband, and he gave her a low opinion of\r\nthe species.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, she is a widow, then?\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you already afraid? She was married at eighteen, by her parents,\r\nin the French fashion, to a disagreeable old man. But he had the good\r\ntaste to die a couple of years afterward, and she is now twenty-five.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo she is French?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrench by her father, English by her mother. She is really more\r\nEnglish than French, and she speaks English as well as you or I\xe2\x80\x94or\r\nrather much better. She belongs to the very top of the basket, as they\r\nsay here. Her family, on each side, is of fabulous antiquity; her\r\nmother is the daughter of an English Catholic earl. Her father is dead,\r\nand since her widowhood she has lived with her mother and a married\r\nbrother. There is another brother, younger, who I believe is wild. They\r\nhave an old hotel in the Rue de l\xe2\x80\x99Universit\xc3\xa9, but their fortune is\r\nsmall, and they make a common household, for economy\xe2\x80\x99s sake. When I was\r\na girl I was put into a convent here for my education, while my father\r\nmade the tour of Europe. It was a silly thing to do with me, but it had\r\nthe advantage that it made me acquainted with Claire de Bellegarde. She\r\nwas younger than I but we became fast friends. I took a tremendous\r\nfancy to her, and she returned my passion as far as she could. They\r\nkept such a tight rein on her that she could do very little, and when I\r\nleft the convent she had to give me up. I was not of her _monde_; I am\r\nnot now, either, but we sometimes meet. They are terrible people\xe2\x80\x94her\r\n_monde_; all mounted upon stilts a mile high, and with pedigrees long\r\nin proportion. It is the skim of the milk of the old _noblesse_. Do you\r\nknow what a Legitimist is, or an Ultramontane? Go into Madame de\r\nCintr\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s drawing-room some afternoon, at five o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and you will see\r\nthe best preserved specimens. I say go, but no one is admitted who\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t show his fifty quarterings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd this is the lady you propose to me to marry?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cA\r\nlady I can\xe2\x80\x99t even approach?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you said just now that you recognized no obstacles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman looked at Mrs. Tristram a while, stroking his moustache. \xe2\x80\x9cIs she\r\na beauty?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, then it\xe2\x80\x99s no use\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is not a beauty, but she is beautiful, two very different things.\r\nA beauty has no faults in her face, the face of a beautiful woman may\r\nhave faults that only deepen its charm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI remember Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9, now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tristram. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is as plain as\r\na pike-staff. A man wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t look at her twice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn saying that _he_ would not look at her twice, my husband\r\nsufficiently describes her,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Tristram rejoined.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs she good; is she clever?\xe2\x80\x9d Newman asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is perfect! I won\xe2\x80\x99t say more than that. When you are praising a\r\nperson to another who is to know her, it is bad policy to go into\r\ndetails. I won\xe2\x80\x99t exaggerate. I simply recommend her. Among all women I\r\nhave known she stands alone; she is of a different clay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like to see her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, simply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will try to manage it. The only way will be to invite her to dinner.\r\nI have never invited her before, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that she will come.\r\nHer old feudal countess of a mother rules the family with an iron hand,\r\nand allows her to have no friends but of her own choosing, and to visit\r\nonly in a certain sacred circle. But I can at least ask her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this moment Mrs. Tristram was interrupted; a servant stepped out\r\nupon the balcony and announced that there were visitors in the\r\ndrawing-room. When Newman\xe2\x80\x99s hostess had gone in to receive her friends,\r\nTom Tristram approached his guest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t put your foot into _this_, my boy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, puffing the last\r\nwhiffs of his cigar. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing in it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman looked askance at him, inquisitive. \xe2\x80\x9cYou tell another story,\r\neh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say simply that Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 is a great white doll of a woman,\r\nwho cultivates quiet haughtiness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, she\xe2\x80\x99s haughty, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe looks at you as if you were so much thin air, and cares for you\r\nabout as much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is very proud, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProud? As proud as I\xe2\x80\x99m humble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd not good-looking?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTristram shrugged his shoulders: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a kind of beauty you must be\r\n_intellectual_ to understand. But I must go in and amuse the company.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSome time elapsed before Newman followed his friends into the\r\ndrawing-room. When he at last made his appearance there he remained but\r\na short time, and during this period sat perfectly silent, listening to\r\na lady to whom Mrs. Tristram had straightway introduced him and who\r\nchattered, without a pause, with the full force of an extraordinarily\r\nhigh-pitched voice. Newman gazed and attended. Presently he came to bid\r\ngood-night to Mrs. Tristram.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is that lady?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Dora Finch. How do you like her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s too noisy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is thought so bright! Certainly, you are fastidious,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs.\r\nTristram.\r\n\r\nNewman stood a moment, hesitating. Then at last, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t forget about\r\nyour friend,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cMadame What\xe2\x80\x99s-her-name? the proud beauty. Ask\r\nher to dinner, and give me a good notice.\xe2\x80\x9d And with this he departed.\r\n\r\nSome days later he came back; it was in the afternoon. He found Mrs.\r\nTristram in her drawing-room; with her was a visitor, a woman young and\r\npretty, dressed in white. The two ladies had risen and the visitor was\r\napparently taking her leave. As Newman approached, he received from\r\nMrs. Tristram a glance of the most vivid significance, which he was not\r\nimmediately able to interpret.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a good friend of ours,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, turning to her companion,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Christopher Newman. I have spoken of you to him and he has an\r\nextreme desire to make your acquaintance. If you had consented to come\r\nand dine, I should have offered him an opportunity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe stranger turned her face toward Newman, with a smile. He was not\r\nembarrassed, for his unconscious _sang-froid_ was boundless; but as he\r\nbecame aware that this was the proud and beautiful Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9,\r\nthe loveliest woman in the world, the promised perfection, the proposed\r\nideal, he made an instinctive movement to gather his wits together.\r\nThrough the slight preoccupation that it produced he had a sense of a\r\nlong, fair face, and of two eyes that were both brilliant and mild.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should have been most happy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9. \xe2\x80\x9cUnfortunately,\r\nas I have been telling Mrs. Tristram, I go on Monday to the country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman had made a solemn bow. \xe2\x80\x9cI am very sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cParis is getting too warm,\xe2\x80\x9d Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 added, taking her\r\nfriend\xe2\x80\x99s hand again in farewell.\r\n\r\nMrs. Tristram seemed to have formed a sudden and somewhat venturesome\r\nresolution, and she smiled more intensely, as women do when they take\r\nsuch resolution. \xe2\x80\x9cI want Mr. Newman to know you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, dropping\r\nher head on one side and looking at Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s bonnet ribbons.\r\n\r\nChristopher Newman stood gravely silent, while his native penetration\r\nadmonished him. Mrs. Tristram was determined to force her friend to\r\naddress him a word of encouragement which should be more than one of\r\nthe common formulas of politeness; and if she was prompted by charity,\r\nit was by the charity that begins at home. Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 was her\r\ndearest Claire, and her especial admiration but Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 had\r\nfound it impossible to dine with her and Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 should for\r\nonce be forced gently to render tribute to Mrs. Tristram.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would give me great pleasure,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, looking at Mrs. Tristram.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a great deal,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the latter, \xe2\x80\x9cfor Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 to say!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very much obliged to you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Tristram can speak\r\nbetter for me than I can speak for myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 looked at him again, with the same soft brightness.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you to be long in Paris?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall keep him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Tristram.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you are keeping _me!_\xe2\x80\x9d and Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 shook her friend\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA moment longer,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Tristram.\r\n\r\nMadame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 looked at Newman again; this time without her smile.\r\nHer eyes lingered a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cWill you come and see me?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\nMrs. Tristram kissed her. Newman expressed his thanks, and she took her\r\nleave. Her hostess went with her to the door, and left Newman alone a\r\nmoment. Presently she returned, rubbing her hands. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a fortunate\r\nchance,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cShe had come to decline my invitation. You\r\ntriumphed on the spot, making her ask you, at the end of three minutes,\r\nto her house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was you who triumphed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must not be too hard upon\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Tristram stared. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe did not strike me as so proud. I should say she was shy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are very discriminating. And what do you think of her face?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s handsome!\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think it was! Of course you will go and see her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not to-morrow; the next day. That will be Sunday; she leaves Paris\r\non Monday. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t see her; it will at least be a beginning.\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nshe gave him Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s address.\r\n\r\nHe walked across the Seine, late in the summer afternoon, and made his\r\nway through those gray and silent streets of the Faubourg St. Germain\r\nwhose houses present to the outer world a face as impassive and as\r\nsuggestive of the concentration of privacy within as the blank walls of\r\nEastern seraglios. Newman thought it a queer way for rich people to\r\nlive; his ideal of grandeur was a splendid fa\xc3\xa7ade diffusing its\r\nbrilliancy outward too, irradiating hospitality. The house to which he\r\nhad been directed had a dark, dusty, painted portal, which swung open\r\nin answer to his ring. It admitted him into a wide, gravelled court,\r\nsurrounded on three sides with closed windows, and with a doorway\r\nfacing the street, approached by three steps and surmounted by a tin\r\ncanopy. The place was all in the shade; it answered to Newman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconception of a convent. The portress could not tell him whether Madame\r\nde Cintr\xc3\xa9 was visible; he would please to apply at the farther door. He\r\ncrossed the court; a gentleman was sitting, bareheaded, on the steps of\r\nthe portico, playing with a beautiful pointer. He rose as Newman\r\napproached, and, as he laid his hand upon the bell, said with a smile,\r\nin English, that he was afraid Newman would be kept waiting; the\r\nservants were scattered, he himself had been ringing, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nwhat the deuce was in them. He was a young man, his English was\r\nexcellent, and his smile very frank. Newman pronounced the name of\r\nMadame de Cintr\xc3\xa9.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man, \xe2\x80\x9cthat my sister is visible. Come in, and\r\nif you will give me your card I will carry it to her myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman had been accompanied on his present errand by a slight\r\nsentiment, I will not say of defiance\xe2\x80\x94a readiness for aggression or\r\ndefence, as they might prove needful\xe2\x80\x94but of reflection, good-humored\r\nsuspicion. He took from his pocket, while he stood on the portico, a\r\ncard upon which, under his name, he had written the words \xe2\x80\x9cSan\r\nFrancisco,\xe2\x80\x9d and while he presented it he looked warily at his\r\ninterlocutor. His glance was singularly reassuring; he liked the young\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s face; it strongly resembled that of Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9. He was\r\nevidently her brother. The young man, on his side, had made a rapid\r\ninspection of Newman\xe2\x80\x99s person. He had taken the card and was about to\r\nenter the house with it when another figure appeared on the\r\nthreshold\xe2\x80\x94an older man, of a fine presence, wearing evening dress. He\r\nlooked hard at Newman, and Newman looked at him. \xe2\x80\x9cMadame de Cintr\xc3\xa9,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nthe younger man repeated, as an introduction of the visitor. The other\r\ntook the card from his hand, read it in a rapid glance, looked again at\r\nNewman from head to foot, hesitated a moment, and then said, gravely\r\nbut urbanely, \xe2\x80\x9cMadame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 is not at home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe younger man made a gesture, and then, turning to Newman, \xe2\x80\x9cI am very\r\nsorry, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nNewman gave him a friendly nod, to show that he bore him no malice, and\r\nretraced his steps. At the porter\xe2\x80\x99s lodge he stopped; the two men were\r\nstill standing on the portico.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is the gentleman with the dog?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked of the old woman who\r\nreappeared. He had begun to learn French.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is Monsieur le Comte.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the other?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is Monsieur le Marquis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA marquis?\xe2\x80\x9d said Christopher in English, which the old woman\r\nfortunately did not understand. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, then he\xe2\x80\x99s not the butler!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly one morning, before Christopher Newman was dressed, a little old\r\nman was ushered into his apartment, followed by a youth in a blouse,\r\nbearing a picture in a brilliant frame. Newman, among the distractions\r\nof Paris, had forgotten M. Nioche and his accomplished daughter; but\r\nthis was an effective reminder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid you had given me up, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man, after many\r\napologies and salutations. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have made you wait so many days. You\r\naccused us, perhaps, of inconstancy, of bad faith. But behold me at\r\nlast! And behold also the pretty Madonna. Place it on a chair, my\r\nfriend, in a good light, so that monsieur may admire it.\xe2\x80\x9d And M.\r\nNioche, addressing his companion, helped him to dispose the work of\r\nart.\r\n\r\nIt had been endued with a layer of varnish an inch thick and its frame,\r\nof an elaborate pattern, was at least a foot wide. It glittered and\r\ntwinkled in the morning light, and looked, to Newman\xe2\x80\x99s eyes,\r\nwonderfully splendid and precious. It seemed to him a very happy\r\npurchase, and he felt rich in the possession of it. He stood looking at\r\nit complacently, while he proceeded with his toilet, and M. Nioche, who\r\nhad dismissed his own attendant, hovered near, smiling and rubbing his\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt has wonderful _finesse_,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured, caressingly. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd here and\r\nthere are marvelous touches, you probably perceive them, sir. It\r\nattracted great attention on the Boulevard, as we came along. And then\r\na gradation of tones! That\xe2\x80\x99s what it is to know how to paint. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsay it because I am her father, sir; but as one man of taste addressing\r\nanother I cannot help observing that you have there an exquisite work.\r\nIt is hard to produce such things and to have to part with them. If our\r\nmeans only allowed us the luxury of keeping it! I really may say, sir\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand M. Nioche gave a little feebly insinuating laugh\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI really may say\r\nthat I envy you! You see,\xe2\x80\x9d he added in a moment, \xe2\x80\x9cwe have taken the\r\nliberty of offering you a frame. It increases by a trifle the value of\r\nthe work, and it will save you the annoyance\xe2\x80\x94so great for a person of\r\nyour delicacy\xe2\x80\x94of going about to bargain at the shops.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe language spoken by M. Nioche was a singular compound, which I\r\nshrink from the attempt to reproduce in its integrity. He had\r\napparently once possessed a certain knowledge of English, and his\r\naccent was oddly tinged with the cockneyism of the British metropolis.\r\nBut his learning had grown rusty with disuse, and his vocabulary was\r\ndefective and capricious. He had repaired it with large patches of\r\nFrench, with words anglicized by a process of his own, and with native\r\nidioms literally translated. The result, in the form in which he in all\r\nhumility presented it, would be scarcely comprehensible to the reader,\r\nso that I have ventured to trim and sift it. Newman only half\r\nunderstood it, but it amused him, and the old man\xe2\x80\x99s decent forlornness\r\nappealed to his democratic instincts. The assumption of a fatality in\r\nmisery always irritated his strong good nature\xe2\x80\x94it was almost the only\r\nthing that did so; and he felt the impulse to wipe it out, as it were,\r\nwith the sponge of his own prosperity. The papa of Mademoiselle No\xc3\xa9mie,\r\nhowever, had apparently on this occasion been vigorously indoctrinated,\r\nand he showed a certain tremulous eagerness to cultivate unexpected\r\nopportunities.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much do I owe you, then, with the frame?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will make in all three thousand francs,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man, smiling\r\nagreeably, but folding his hands in instinctive suppliance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you give me a receipt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have brought one,\xe2\x80\x9d said M. Nioche. \xe2\x80\x9cI took the liberty of drawing it\r\nup, in case monsieur should happen to desire to discharge his debt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAnd he drew a paper from his pocket-book and presented it to his\r\npatron. The document was written in a minute, fantastic hand, and\r\ncouched in the choicest language.\r\n\r\nNewman laid down the money, and M. Nioche dropped the napoleons one by\r\none, solemnly and lovingly, into an old leathern purse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how is your young lady?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cShe made a great\r\nimpression on me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn impression? Monsieur is very good. Monsieur admires her\r\nappearance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is very pretty, certainly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas, yes, she is very pretty!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what is the harm in her being pretty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. Nioche fixed his eyes upon a spot on the carpet and shook his head.\r\nThen looking up at Newman with a gaze that seemed to brighten and\r\nexpand, \xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur knows what Paris is. She is dangerous to beauty, when\r\nbeauty hasn\xe2\x80\x99t the sou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, but that is not the case with your daughter. She is rich, now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery true; we are rich for six months. But if my daughter were a plain\r\ngirl I should sleep better all the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are afraid of the young men?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe young and the old!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe ought to get a husband.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, monsieur, one doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get a husband for nothing. Her husband must\r\ntake her as she is; I can\xe2\x80\x99t give her a sou. But the young men don\xe2\x80\x99t see\r\nwith that eye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, \xe2\x80\x9cher talent is in itself a dowry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, sir, it needs first to be converted into specie!\xe2\x80\x9d and M. Nioche\r\nslapped his purse tenderly before he stowed it away. \xe2\x80\x9cThe operation\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t take place every day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, your young men are very shabby,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman; \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s all I can\r\nsay. They ought to pay for your daughter, and not ask money\r\nthemselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose are very noble ideas, monsieur; but what will you have? They are\r\nnot the ideas of this country. We want to know what we are about when\r\nwe marry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow big a portion does your daughter want?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. Nioche stared, as if he wondered what was coming next; but he\r\npromptly recovered himself, at a venture, and replied that he knew a\r\nvery nice young man, employed by an insurance company, who would\r\ncontent himself with fifteen thousand francs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet your daughter paint half a dozen pictures for me, and she shall\r\nhave her dowry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHalf a dozen pictures\xe2\x80\x94her dowry! Monsieur is not speaking\r\ninconsiderately?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf she will make me six or eight copies in the Louvre as pretty as\r\nthat Madonna, I will pay her the same price,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\nPoor M. Nioche was speechless a moment, with amazement and gratitude,\r\nand then he seized Newman\xe2\x80\x99s hand, pressed it between his own ten\r\nfingers, and gazed at him with watery eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cAs pretty as that? They\r\nshall be a thousand times prettier\xe2\x80\x94they shall be magnificent, sublime.\r\nAh, if I only knew how to paint, myself, sir, so that I might lend a\r\nhand! What can I do to thank you? _Voyons!_\xe2\x80\x9d And he pressed his\r\nforehead while he tried to think of something.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you have thanked me enough,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, here it is, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d cried M. Nioche. \xe2\x80\x9cTo express my gratitude, I\r\nwill charge you nothing for the lessons in French conversation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe lessons? I had quite forgotten them. Listening to your English,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nadded Newman, laughing, \xe2\x80\x9cis almost a lesson in French.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t profess to teach English, certainly,\xe2\x80\x9d said M. Nioche. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\nfor my own admirable tongue I am still at your service.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince you are here, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, \xe2\x80\x9cwe will begin. This is a very\r\ngood hour. I am going to have my coffee; come every morning at\r\nhalf-past nine and have yours with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur offers me my coffee, also?\xe2\x80\x9d cried M. Nioche. \xe2\x80\x9cTruly, my\r\n_beaux jours_ are coming back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, \xe2\x80\x9clet us begin. The coffee is almighty hot. How do\r\nyou say that in French?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEvery day, then, for the following three weeks, the minutely\r\nrespectable figure of M. Nioche made its appearance, with a series of\r\nlittle inquiring and apologetic obeisances, among the aromatic fumes of\r\nNewman\xe2\x80\x99s morning beverage. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how much French our friend\r\nlearned, but, as he himself said, if the attempt did him no good, it\r\ncould at any rate do him no harm. And it amused him; it gratified that\r\nirregularly sociable side of his nature which had always expressed\r\nitself in a relish for ungrammatical conversation, and which often,\r\neven in his busy and preoccupied days, had made him sit on rail fences\r\nin young Western towns, in the twilight, in gossip hardly less than\r\nfraternal with humorous loafers and obscure fortune-seekers. He had\r\nnotions, wherever he went, about talking with the natives; he had been\r\nassured, and his judgment approved the advice, that in traveling abroad\r\nit was an excellent thing to look into the life of the country. M.\r\nNioche was very much of a native and, though his life might not be\r\nparticularly worth looking into, he was a palpable and smoothly-rounded\r\nunit in that picturesque Parisian civilization which offered our hero\r\nso much easy entertainment and propounded so many curious problems to\r\nhis inquiring and practical mind. Newman was fond of statistics; he\r\nliked to know how things were done; it gratified him to learn what\r\ntaxes were paid, what profits were gathered, what commercial habits\r\nprevailed, how the battle of life was fought. M. Nioche, as a reduced\r\ncapitalist, was familiar with these considerations, and he formulated\r\nhis information, which he was proud to be able to impart, in the\r\nneatest possible terms and with a pinch of snuff between finger and\r\nthumb. As a Frenchman\xe2\x80\x94quite apart from Newman\xe2\x80\x99s napoleons\xe2\x80\x94M. Nioche\r\nloved conversation, and even in his decay his urbanity had not grown\r\nrusty. As a Frenchman, too, he could give a clear account of things,\r\nand\xe2\x80\x94still as a Frenchman\xe2\x80\x94when his knowledge was at fault he could\r\nsupply its lapses with the most convenient and ingenious hypotheses.\r\nThe little shrunken financier was intensely delighted to have questions\r\nasked him, and he scraped together information, by frugal processes,\r\nand took notes, in his little greasy pocket-book, of incidents which\r\nmight interest his munificent friend. He read old almanacs at the\r\nbook-stalls on the quays, and he began to frequent another _caf\xc3\xa9_,\r\nwhere more newspapers were taken and his postprandial _demitasse_ cost\r\nhim a penny extra, and where he used to con the tattered sheets for\r\ncurious anecdotes, freaks of nature, and strange coincidences. He would\r\nrelate with solemnity the next morning that a child of five years of\r\nage had lately died at Bordeaux, whose brain had been found to weigh\r\nsixty ounces\xe2\x80\x94the brain of a Napoleon or a Washington! or that Madame\r\nP\xe2\x80\x94, _charcuti\xc3\xa8re_ in the Rue de Clichy, had found in the wadding of an\r\nold petticoat the sum of three hundred and sixty francs, which she had\r\nlost five years before. He pronounced his words with great distinctness\r\nand sonority, and Newman assured him that his way of dealing with the\r\nFrench tongue was very superior to the bewildering chatter that he\r\nheard in other mouths. Upon this M. Nioche\xe2\x80\x99s accent became more finely\r\ntrenchant than ever, he offered to read extracts from Lamartine, and he\r\nprotested that, although he did endeavor according to his feeble lights\r\nto cultivate refinement of diction, monsieur, if he wanted the real\r\nthing, should go to the Th\xc3\xa9\xc3\xa2tre Fran\xc3\xa7ais.\r\n\r\nNewman took an interest in French thriftiness and conceived a lively\r\nadmiration for Parisian economies. His own economic genius was so\r\nentirely for operations on a larger scale, and, to move at his ease, he\r\nneeded so imperatively the sense of great risks and great prizes, that\r\nhe found an ungrudging entertainment in the spectacle of fortunes made\r\nby the aggregation of copper coins, and in the minute subdivision of\r\nlabor and profit. He questioned M. Nioche about his own manner of life,\r\nand felt a friendly mixture of compassion and respect over the recital\r\nof his delicate frugalities. The worthy man told him how, at one\r\nperiod, he and his daughter had supported existence comfortably upon\r\nthe sum of fifteen sous _per diem_; recently, having succeeded in\r\nhauling ashore the last floating fragments of the wreck of his fortune,\r\nhis budget had been a trifle more ample. But they still had to count\r\ntheir sous very narrowly, and M. Nioche intimated with a sigh that\r\nMademoiselle No\xc3\xa9mie did not bring to this task that zealous cooperation\r\nwhich might have been desired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what will you have?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99 he asked, philosophically. \xe2\x80\x9cOne is young,\r\none is pretty, one needs new dresses and fresh gloves; one can\xe2\x80\x99t wear\r\nshabby gowns among the splendors of the Louvre.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut your daughter earns enough to pay for her own clothes,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nNewman.\r\n\r\nM. Nioche looked at him with weak, uncertain eyes. He would have liked\r\nto be able to say that his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s talents were appreciated, and\r\nthat her crooked little daubs commanded a market; but it seemed a\r\nscandal to abuse the credulity of this free-handed stranger, who,\r\nwithout a suspicion or a question, had admitted him to equal social\r\nrights. He compromised, and declared that while it was obvious that\r\nMademoiselle No\xc3\xa9mie\xe2\x80\x99s reproductions of the old masters had only to be\r\nseen to be coveted, the prices which, in consideration of their\r\naltogether peculiar degree of finish, she felt obliged to ask for them\r\nhad kept purchasers at a respectful distance. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor little one!\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nM. Nioche, with a sigh; \xe2\x80\x9cit is almost a pity that her work is so\r\nperfect! It would be in her interest to paint less well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if Mademoiselle No\xc3\xa9mie has this devotion to her art,\xe2\x80\x9d Newman once\r\nobserved, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy should you have those fears for her that you spoke of\r\nthe other day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. Nioche meditated: there was an inconsistency in his position; it\r\nmade him chronically uncomfortable. Though he had no desire to destroy\r\nthe goose with the golden eggs\xe2\x80\x94Newman\xe2\x80\x99s benevolent confidence\xe2\x80\x94he felt a\r\ntremulous impulse to speak out all his trouble. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, she is an artist,\r\nmy dear sir, most assuredly,\xe2\x80\x9d he declared. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, to tell you the truth,\r\nshe is also a _franche coquette_. I am sorry to say,\xe2\x80\x9d he added in a\r\nmoment, shaking his head with a world of harmless bitterness, \xe2\x80\x9cthat she\r\ncomes honestly by it. Her mother was one before her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were not happy with your wife?\xe2\x80\x9d Newman asked.\r\n\r\nM. Nioche gave half a dozen little backward jerks of his head. \xe2\x80\x9cShe was\r\nmy purgatory, monsieur!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe deceived you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnder my nose, year after year. I was too stupid, and the temptation\r\nwas too great. But I found her out at last. I have only been once in my\r\nlife a man to be afraid of; I know it very well; it was in that hour!\r\nNevertheless I don\xe2\x80\x99t like to think of it. I loved her\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you\r\nhow much. She was a bad woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is not living?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has gone to her account.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer influence on your daughter, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman encouragingly, \xe2\x80\x9cis\r\nnot to be feared.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe cared no more for her daughter than for the sole of her shoe! But\r\nNo\xc3\xa9mie has no need of influence. She is sufficient to herself. She is\r\nstronger than I.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t obey you, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe can\xe2\x80\x99t obey, monsieur, since I don\xe2\x80\x99t command. What would be the\r\nuse? It would only irritate her and drive her to some _coup de t\xc3\xaate_.\r\nShe is very clever, like her mother; she would waste no time about it.\r\nAs a child\xe2\x80\x94when I was happy, or supposed I was\xe2\x80\x94she studied drawing and\r\npainting with first-class professors, and they assured me she had a\r\ntalent. I was delighted to believe it, and when I went into society I\r\nused to carry her pictures with me in a portfolio and hand them round\r\nto the company. I remember, once, a lady thought I was offering them\r\nfor sale, and I took it very ill. We don\xe2\x80\x99t know what we may come to!\r\nThen came my dark days, and my explosion with Madame Nioche. No\xc3\xa9mie had\r\nno more twenty-franc lessons; but in the course of time, when she grew\r\nolder, and it became highly expedient that she should do something that\r\nwould help to keep us alive, she bethought herself of her palette and\r\nbrushes. Some of our friends in the _quartier_ pronounced the idea\r\nfantastic: they recommended her to try bonnet making, to get a\r\nsituation in a shop, or\xe2\x80\x94if she was more ambitious\xe2\x80\x94to advertise for a\r\nplace of _dame de compagnie_. She did advertise, and an old lady wrote\r\nher a letter and bade her come and see her. The old lady liked her, and\r\noffered her her living and six hundred francs a year; but No\xc3\xa9mie\r\ndiscovered that she passed her life in her armchair and had only two\r\nvisitors, her confessor and her nephew: the confessor very strict, and\r\nthe nephew a man of fifty, with a broken nose and a government\r\nclerkship of two thousand francs. She threw her old lady over, bought a\r\npaint-box, a canvas, and a new dress, and went and set up her easel in\r\nthe Louvre. There in one place and another, she has passed the last two\r\nyears; I can\xe2\x80\x99t say it has made us millionaires. But No\xc3\xa9mie tells me\r\nthat Rome was not built in a day, that she is making great progress,\r\nthat I must leave her to her own devices. The fact is, without\r\nprejudice to her genius, that she has no idea of burying herself alive.\r\nShe likes to see the world, and to be seen. She says, herself, that she\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t work in the dark. With her appearance it is very natural. Only, I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t help worrying and trembling and wondering what may happen to her\r\nthere all alone, day after day, amid all that coming and going of\r\nstrangers. I can\xe2\x80\x99t be always at her side. I go with her in the morning,\r\nand I come to fetch her away, but she won\xe2\x80\x99t have me near her in the\r\ninterval; she says I make her nervous. As if it didn\xe2\x80\x99t make me nervous\r\nto wander about all day without her! Ah, if anything were to happen to\r\nher!\xe2\x80\x9d cried M. Nioche, clenching his two fists and jerking back his\r\nhead again, portentously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I guess nothing will happen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe I should shoot her!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man, solemnly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, we\xe2\x80\x99ll marry her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, \xe2\x80\x9csince that\xe2\x80\x99s how you manage it;\r\nand I will go and see her tomorrow at the Louvre and pick out the\r\npictures she is to copy for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. Nioche had brought Newman a message from his daughter, in acceptance\r\nof his magnificent commission, the young lady declaring herself his\r\nmost devoted servant, promising her most zealous endeavor, and\r\nregretting that the proprieties forbade her coming to thank him in\r\nperson. The morning after the conversation just narrated, Newman\r\nreverted to his intention of meeting Mademoiselle No\xc3\xa9mie at the Louvre.\r\nM. Nioche appeared preoccupied, and left his budget of anecdotes\r\nunopened; he took a great deal of snuff, and sent certain oblique,\r\nappealing glances toward his stalwart pupil. At last, when he was\r\ntaking his leave, he stood a moment, after he had polished his hat with\r\nhis calico pocket-handkerchief, with his small, pale eyes fixed\r\nstrangely upon Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d our hero demanded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcuse the solicitude of a father\xe2\x80\x99s heart!\xe2\x80\x9d said M. Nioche. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\ninspire me with boundless confidence, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t help giving you a\r\nwarning. After all, you are a man, you are young and at liberty. Let me\r\nbeseech you, then, to respect the innocence of Mademoiselle Nioche!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman had wondered what was coming, and at this he broke into a laugh.\r\nHe was on the point of declaring that his own innocence struck him as\r\nthe more exposed, but he contented himself with promising to treat the\r\nyoung girl with nothing less than veneration. He found her waiting for\r\nhim, seated upon the great divan in the Salon Carr\xc3\xa9. She was not in her\r\nworking-day costume, but wore her bonnet and gloves and carried her\r\nparasol, in honor of the occasion. These articles had been selected\r\nwith unerring taste, and a fresher, prettier image of youthful\r\nalertness and blooming discretion was not to be conceived. She made\r\nNewman a most respectful curtsey and expressed her gratitude for his\r\nliberality in a wonderfully graceful little speech. It annoyed him to\r\nhave a charming young girl stand there thanking him, and it made him\r\nfeel uncomfortable to think that this perfect young lady, with her\r\nexcellent manners and her finished intonation, was literally in his\r\npay. He assured her, in such French as he could muster, that the thing\r\nwas not worth mentioning, and that he considered her services a great\r\nfavor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhenever you please, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mademoiselle No\xc3\xa9mie, \xe2\x80\x9cwe will pass\r\nthe review.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey walked slowly round the room, then passed into the others and\r\nstrolled about for half an hour. Mademoiselle No\xc3\xa9mie evidently relished\r\nher situation, and had no desire to bring her public interview with her\r\nstriking-looking patron to a close. Newman perceived that prosperity\r\nagreed with her. The little thin-lipped, peremptory air with which she\r\nhad addressed her father on the occasion of their former meeting had\r\ngiven place to the most lingering and caressing tones.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat sort of pictures do you desire?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. \xe2\x80\x9cSacred, or profane?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, a few of each,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I want something bright and\r\ngay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething gay? There is nothing very gay in this solemn old Louvre.\r\nBut we will see what we can find. You speak French to-day like a charm.\r\nMy father has done wonders.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I am a bad subject,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cI am too old to learn a\r\nlanguage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToo old? _Quelle folie!_\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mademoiselle No\xc3\xa9mie, with a clear,\r\nshrill laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are a very young man. And how do you like my\r\nfather?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is a very nice old gentleman. He never laughs at my blunders.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is very _comme il faut_, my papa,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mademoiselle No\xc3\xa9mie, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nas honest as the day. Oh, an exceptional probity! You could trust him\r\nwith millions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you always obey him?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cObey him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you do what he bids you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young girl stopped and looked at him; she had a spot of color in\r\neither cheek, and in her expressive French eye, which projected too\r\nmuch for perfect beauty, there was a slight gleam of audacity. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy do\r\nyou ask me that?\xe2\x80\x9d she demanded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I want to know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think me a bad girl?\xe2\x80\x9d And she gave a strange smile.\r\n\r\nNewman looked at her a moment; he saw that she was pretty, but he was\r\nnot in the least dazzled. He remembered poor M. Nioche\xe2\x80\x99s solicitude for\r\nher \xe2\x80\x9cinnocence,\xe2\x80\x9d and he laughed as his eyes met hers. Her face was the\r\noddest mixture of youth and maturity, and beneath her candid brow her\r\nsearching little smile seemed to contain a world of ambiguous\r\nintentions. She was pretty enough, certainly to make her father\r\nnervous; but, as regards her innocence, Newman felt ready on the spot\r\nto affirm that she had never parted with it. She had simply never had\r\nany; she had been looking at the world since she was ten years old, and\r\nhe would have been a wise man who could tell her any secrets. In her\r\nlong mornings at the Louvre she had not only studied Madonnas and St.\r\nJohns; she had kept an eye upon all the variously embodied human nature\r\naround her, and she had formed her conclusions. In a certain sense, it\r\nseemed to Newman, M. Nioche might be at rest; his daughter might do\r\nsomething very audacious, but she would never do anything foolish.\r\nNewman, with his long-drawn, leisurely smile, and his even, unhurried\r\nutterance, was always, mentally, taking his time; and he asked himself,\r\nnow, what she was looking at him in that way for. He had an idea that\r\nshe would like him to confess that he did think her a bad girl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last; \xe2\x80\x9cit would be very bad manners in me to judge\r\nyou that way. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut my father has complained to you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mademoiselle No\xc3\xa9mie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe says you are a coquette.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go about saying such things to gentlemen! But you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbelieve it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman gravely, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at him again, gave a shrug and a smile, and then pointed to\r\na small Italian picture, a Marriage of St. Catherine. \xe2\x80\x9cHow should you\r\nlike that?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t please me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cThe young lady in the yellow\r\ndress is not pretty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you are a great connoisseur,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Mademoiselle No\xc3\xa9mie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn pictures? Oh, no; I know very little about them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn pretty women, then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that I am hardly better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you say to that, then?\xe2\x80\x9d the young girl asked, indicating a\r\nsuperb Italian portrait of a lady. \xe2\x80\x9cI will do it for you on a smaller\r\nscale.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn a smaller scale? Why not as large as the original?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMademoiselle No\xc3\xa9mie glanced at the glowing splendor of the Venetian\r\nmasterpiece and gave a little toss of her head. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like that\r\nwoman. She looks stupid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do like her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cDecidedly, I must have her, as large as\r\nlife. And just as stupid as she is there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young girl fixed her eyes on him again, and with her mocking smile,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt certainly ought to be easy for me to make her look stupid!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Newman, puzzled.\r\n\r\nShe gave another little shrug. \xe2\x80\x9cSeriously, then, you want that\r\nportrait\xe2\x80\x94the golden hair, the purple satin, the pearl necklace, the two\r\nmagnificent arms?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything\xe2\x80\x94just as it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould nothing else do, instead?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I want some other things, but I want that too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMademoiselle No\xc3\xa9mie turned away a moment, walked to the other side of\r\nthe hall, and stood there, looking vaguely about her. At last she came\r\nback. \xe2\x80\x9cIt must be charming to be able to order pictures at such a rate.\r\nVenetian portraits, as large as life! You go at it _en prince_. And you\r\nare going to travel about Europe that way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I intend to travel,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOrdering, buying, spending money?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I shall spend some money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are very happy to have it. And you are perfectly free?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you mean, free?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have nothing to bother you\xe2\x80\x94no family, no wife, no _fianc\xc3\xa9e?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I am tolerably free.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are very happy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mademoiselle No\xc3\xa9mie, gravely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Je le veux bien!_\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, proving that he had learned more\r\nFrench than he admitted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how long shall you stay in Paris?\xe2\x80\x9d the young girl went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly a few days more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you go away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is getting hot, and I must go to Switzerland.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo Switzerland? That\xe2\x80\x99s a fine country. I would give my new parasol to\r\nsee it! Lakes and mountains, romantic valleys and icy peaks! Oh, I\r\ncongratulate you. Meanwhile, I shall sit here through all the hot\r\nsummer, daubing at your pictures.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, take your time about it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cDo them at your\r\nconvenience.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey walked farther and looked at a dozen other things. Newman pointed\r\nout what pleased him, and Mademoiselle No\xc3\xa9mie generally criticised it,\r\nand proposed something else. Then suddenly she diverged and began to\r\ntalk about some personal matter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat made you speak to me the other day in the Salon Carr\xc3\xa9?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nabruptly asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI admired your picture.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you hesitated a long time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I do nothing rashly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I saw you watching me. But I never supposed you were going to\r\nspeak to me. I never dreamed I should be walking about here with you\r\nto-day. It\xe2\x80\x99s very curious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is very natural,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I beg your pardon; not to me. Coquette as you think me, I have\r\nnever walked about in public with a gentleman before. What was my\r\nfather thinking of, when he consented to our interview?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was repenting of his unjust accusations,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Newman.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle No\xc3\xa9mie remained silent; at last she dropped into a seat.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then, for those five it is fixed,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cFive copies as\r\nbrilliant and beautiful as I can make them. We have one more to choose.\r\nShouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you like one of those great Rubenses\xe2\x80\x94the marriage of Marie de\r\nM\xc3\xa9dicis? Just look at it and see how handsome it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes; I should like that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cFinish off with that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFinish off with that\xe2\x80\x94good!\xe2\x80\x9d And she laughed. She sat a moment, looking\r\nat him, and then she suddenly rose and stood before him, with her hands\r\nhanging and clasped in front of her. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said\r\nwith a smile. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand how a man can be so ignorant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I am ignorant, certainly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, putting his hands into his\r\npockets.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s ridiculous! I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to paint.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know how?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI paint like a cat; I can\xe2\x80\x99t draw a straight line. I never sold a\r\npicture until you bought that thing the other day.\xe2\x80\x9d And as she offered\r\nthis surprising information she continued to smile.\r\n\r\nNewman burst into a laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you tell me this?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause it irritates me to see a clever man blunder so. My pictures\r\nare grotesque.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the one I possess\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat one is rather worse than usual.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, \xe2\x80\x9cI like it all the same!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at him askance. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is a very pretty thing to say,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nanswered; \xe2\x80\x9cbut it is my duty to warn you before you go farther. This\r\norder of yours is impossible, you know. What do you take me for? It is\r\nwork for ten men. You pick out the six most difficult pictures in the\r\nLouvre, and you expect me to go to work as if I were sitting down to\r\nhem a dozen pocket handkerchiefs. I wanted to see how far you would\r\ngo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman looked at the young girl in some perplexity. In spite of the\r\nridiculous blunder of which he stood convicted, he was very far from\r\nbeing a simpleton, and he had a lively suspicion that Mademoiselle\r\nNo\xc3\xa9mie\xe2\x80\x99s sudden frankness was not essentially more honest than her\r\nleaving him in error would have been. She was playing a game; she was\r\nnot simply taking pity on his \xc3\xa6sthetic verdancy. What was it she\r\nexpected to win? The stakes were high and the risk was great; the prize\r\ntherefore must have been commensurate. But even granting that the prize\r\nmight be great, Newman could not resist a movement of admiration for\r\nhis companion\xe2\x80\x99s intrepidity. She was throwing away with one hand,\r\nwhatever she might intend to do with the other, a very handsome sum of\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you joking,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cor are you serious?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, serious!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mademoiselle No\xc3\xa9mie, but with her extraordinary\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know very little about pictures or how they are painted. If you\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t do all that, of course you can\xe2\x80\x99t. Do what you can, then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will be very bad,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mademoiselle No\xc3\xa9mie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, laughing, \xe2\x80\x9cif you are determined it shall be bad, of\r\ncourse it will. But why do you go on painting badly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can do nothing else; I have no real talent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are deceiving your father, then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young girl hesitated a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cHe knows very well!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d Newman declared; \xe2\x80\x9cI am sure he believes in you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is afraid of me. I go on painting badly, as you say, because I want\r\nto learn. I like it, at any rate. And I like being here; it is a place\r\nto come to, every day; it is better than sitting in a little dark, damp\r\nroom, on a court, or selling buttons and whalebones over a counter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course it is much more amusing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cBut for a poor girl\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t it rather an expensive amusement?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I am very wrong, there is no doubt about that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mademoiselle\r\nNo\xc3\xa9mie. \xe2\x80\x9cBut rather than earn my living as some girls do\xe2\x80\x94toiling with a\r\nneedle, in little black holes, out of the world\xe2\x80\x94I would throw myself\r\ninto the Seine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no need of that,\xe2\x80\x9d Newman answered; \xe2\x80\x9cyour father told you my\r\noffer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour offer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe wants you to marry, and I told him I would give you a chance to\r\nearn your _dot_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe told me all about it, and you see the account I make of it! Why\r\nshould you take such an interest in my marriage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy interest was in your father. I hold to my offer; do what you can,\r\nand I will buy what you paint.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stood for some time, meditating, with her eyes on the ground. At\r\nlast, looking up, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat sort of a husband can you get for twelve\r\nthousand francs?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour father tells me he knows some very good young men.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGrocers and butchers and little _ma\xc3\xaetres de caf\xc3\xa9s!_ I will not marry\r\nat all if I can\xe2\x80\x99t marry well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would advise you not to be too fastidious,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all\r\nthe advice I can give you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very much vexed at what I have said!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the young girl. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nhas done me no good. But I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat good did you expect it to do you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help it, simply.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman looked at her a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, your pictures may be bad,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cbut you are too clever for me, nevertheless. I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand\r\nyou. Good-bye!\xe2\x80\x9d And he put out his hand.\r\n\r\nShe made no response, and offered him no farewell. She turned away and\r\nseated herself sidewise on a bench, leaning her head on the back of her\r\nhand, which clasped the rail in front of the pictures. Newman stood a\r\nmoment and then turned on his heel and retreated. He had understood her\r\nbetter than he confessed; this singular scene was a practical\r\ncommentary upon her father\xe2\x80\x99s statement that she was a frank coquette.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Newman related to Mrs. Tristram his fruitless visit to Madame de\r\nCintr\xc3\xa9, she urged him not to be discouraged, but to carry out his plan\r\nof \xe2\x80\x9cseeing Europe\xe2\x80\x9d during the summer, and return to Paris in the autumn\r\nand settle down comfortably for the winter. \xe2\x80\x9cMadame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 will\r\nkeep,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cshe is not a woman who will marry from one day to\r\nanother.\xe2\x80\x9d Newman made no distinct affirmation that he would come back\r\nto Paris; he even talked about Rome and the Nile, and abstained from\r\nprofessing any especial interest in Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s continued\r\nwidowhood. This circumstance was at variance with his habitual\r\nfrankness, and may perhaps be regarded as characteristic of the\r\nincipient stage of that passion which is more particularly known as the\r\nmysterious one. The truth is that the expression of a pair of eyes that\r\nwere at once brilliant and mild had become very familiar to his memory,\r\nand he would not easily have resigned himself to the prospect of never\r\nlooking into them again. He communicated to Mrs. Tristram a number of\r\nother facts, of greater or less importance, as you choose; but on this\r\nparticular point he kept his own counsel. He took a kindly leave of M.\r\nNioche, having assured him that, so far as he was concerned, the\r\nblue-cloaked Madonna herself might have been present at his interview\r\nwith Mademoiselle No\xc3\xa9mie; and left the old man nursing his\r\nbreast-pocket, in an ecstasy which the acutest misfortune might have\r\nbeen defied to dissipate. Newman then started on his travels, with all\r\nhis usual appearance of slow-strolling leisure, and all his essential\r\ndirectness and intensity of aim. No man seemed less in a hurry, and yet\r\nno man achieved more in brief periods. He had certain practical\r\ninstincts which served him excellently in his trade of tourist. He\r\nfound his way in foreign cities by divination, his memory was excellent\r\nwhen once his attention had been at all cordially given, and he emerged\r\nfrom dialogues in foreign tongues, of which he had, formally, not\r\nunderstood a word, in full possession of the particular fact he had\r\ndesired to ascertain. His appetite for facts was capacious, and\r\nalthough many of those which he noted would have seemed woefully dry\r\nand colorless to the ordinary sentimental traveler, a careful\r\ninspection of the list would have shown that he had a soft spot in his\r\nimagination. In the charming city of Brussels\xe2\x80\x94his first stopping-place\r\nafter leaving Paris\xe2\x80\x94he asked a great many questions about the\r\nstreet-cars, and took extreme satisfaction in the reappearance of this\r\nfamiliar symbol of American civilization; but he was also greatly\r\nstruck with the beautiful Gothic tower of the H\xc3\xb4tel de Ville, and\r\nwondered whether it would not be possible to \xe2\x80\x9cget up\xe2\x80\x9d something like it\r\nin San Francisco. He stood for half an hour in the crowded square\r\nbefore this edifice, in imminent danger from carriage-wheels, listening\r\nto a toothless old cicerone mumble in broken English the touching\r\nhistory of Counts Egmont and Horn; and he wrote the names of these\r\ngentlemen\xe2\x80\x94for reasons best known to himself\xe2\x80\x94on the back of an old\r\nletter.\r\n\r\nAt the outset, on his leaving Paris, his curiosity had not been\r\nintense; passive entertainment, in the Champs \xc3\x89lys\xc3\xa9es and at the\r\ntheatres, seemed about as much as he need expect of himself, and\r\nalthough, as he had said to Tristram, he wanted to see the mysterious,\r\nsatisfying _best_, he had not the Grand Tour in the least on his\r\nconscience, and was not given to cross-questioning the amusement of the\r\nhour. He believed that Europe was made for him, and not he for Europe.\r\nHe had said that he wanted to improve his mind, but he would have felt\r\na certain embarrassment, a certain shame, even\xe2\x80\x94a false shame,\r\npossibly\xe2\x80\x94if he had caught himself looking intellectually into the\r\nmirror. Neither in this nor in any other respect had Newman a high\r\nsense of responsibility; it was his prime conviction that a man\xe2\x80\x99s life\r\nshould be easy, and that he should be able to resolve privilege into a\r\nmatter of course. The world, to his sense, was a great bazaar, where\r\none might stroll about and purchase handsome things; but he was no more\r\nconscious, individually, of social pressure than he admitted the\r\nexistence of such a thing as an obligatory purchase. He had not only a\r\ndislike, but a sort of moral mistrust, of uncomfortable thoughts, and\r\nit was both uncomfortable and slightly contemptible to feel obliged to\r\nsquare one\xe2\x80\x99s self with a standard. One\xe2\x80\x99s standard was the ideal of\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s own good-humored prosperity, the prosperity which enabled one to\r\ngive as well as take. To expand, without bothering about it\xe2\x80\x94without\r\nshiftless timidity on one side, or loquacious eagerness on the other\xe2\x80\x94to\r\nthe full compass of what he would have called a \xe2\x80\x9cpleasant\xe2\x80\x9d experience,\r\nwas Newman\xe2\x80\x99s most definite programme of life. He had always hated to\r\nhurry to catch railroad trains, and yet he had always caught them; and\r\njust so an undue solicitude for \xe2\x80\x9cculture\xe2\x80\x9d seemed a sort of silly\r\ndawdling at the station, a proceeding properly confined to women,\r\nforeigners, and other unpractical persons. All this admitted, Newman\r\nenjoyed his journey, when once he had fairly entered the current, as\r\nprofoundly as the most zealous _dilettante_. One\xe2\x80\x99s theories, after all,\r\nmatter little; it is one\xe2\x80\x99s humor that is the great thing. Our friend\r\nwas intelligent, and he could not help that. He lounged through Belgium\r\nand Holland and the Rhineland, through Switzerland and Northern Italy,\r\nplanning about nothing, but seeing everything. The guides and _valets\r\nde place_ found him an excellent subject. He was always approachable,\r\nfor he was much addicted to standing about in the vestibules and\r\nporticos of inns, and he availed himself little of the opportunities\r\nfor impressive seclusion which are so liberally offered in Europe to\r\ngentlemen who travel with long purses. When an excursion, a church, a\r\ngallery, a ruin, was proposed to him, the first thing Newman usually\r\ndid, after surveying his postulant in silence, from head to foot, was\r\nto sit down at a little table and order something to drink. The\r\ncicerone, during this process, usually retreated to a respectful\r\ndistance; otherwise I am not sure that Newman would not have bidden him\r\nsit down and have a glass also, and tell him as an honest fellow\r\nwhether his church or his gallery was really worth a man\xe2\x80\x99s trouble. At\r\nlast he rose and stretched his long legs, beckoned to the man of\r\nmonuments, looked at his watch, and fixed his eye on his adversary.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cHow far?\xe2\x80\x9d And whatever the answer was,\r\nalthough he sometimes seemed to hesitate, he never declined. He stepped\r\ninto an open cab, made his conductor sit beside him to answer\r\nquestions, bade the driver go fast (he had a particular aversion to\r\nslow driving) and rolled, in all probability through a dusty suburb, to\r\nthe goal of his pilgrimage. If the goal was a disappointment, if the\r\nchurch was meagre, or the ruin a heap of rubbish, Newman never\r\nprotested or berated his cicerone; he looked with an impartial eye upon\r\ngreat monuments and small, made the guide recite his lesson, listened\r\nto it religiously, asked if there was nothing else to be seen in the\r\nneighborhood, and drove back again at a rattling pace. It is to be\r\nfeared that his perception of the difference between good architecture\r\nand bad was not acute, and that he might sometimes have been seen\r\ngazing with culpable serenity at inferior productions. Ugly churches\r\nwere a part of his pastime in Europe, as well as beautiful ones, and\r\nhis tour was altogether a pastime. But there is sometimes nothing like\r\nthe imagination of these people who have none, and Newman, now and\r\nthen, in an unguided stroll in a foreign city, before some lonely,\r\nsad-towered church, or some angular image of one who had rendered civic\r\nservice in an unknown past, had felt a singular inward tremor. It was\r\nnot an excitement or a perplexity; it was a placid, fathomless sense of\r\ndiversion.\r\n\r\nHe encountered by chance in Holland a young American, with whom, for a\r\ntime, he formed a sort of traveler\xe2\x80\x99s partnership. They were men of a\r\nvery different cast, but each, in his way, was so good a fellow that,\r\nfor a few weeks at least, it seemed something of a pleasure to share\r\nthe chances of the road. Newman\xe2\x80\x99s comrade, whose name was Babcock, was\r\na young Unitarian minister, a small, spare, neatly-attired man, with a\r\nstrikingly candid physiognomy. He was a native of Dorchester,\r\nMassachusetts, and had spiritual charge of a small congregation in\r\nanother suburb of the New England metropolis. His digestion was weak\r\nand he lived chiefly on Graham bread and hominy\xe2\x80\x94a regimen to which he\r\nwas so much attached that his tour seemed to him destined to be\r\nblighted when, on landing on the Continent, he found that these\r\ndelicacies did not flourish under the _table d\xe2\x80\x99h\xc3\xb4te_ system. In Paris\r\nhe had purchased a bag of hominy at an establishment which called\r\nitself an American Agency, and at which the New York illustrated papers\r\nwere also to be procured, and he had carried it about with him, and\r\nshown extreme serenity and fortitude in the somewhat delicate position\r\nof having his hominy prepared for him and served at anomalous hours, at\r\nthe hotels he successively visited. Newman had once spent a morning, in\r\nthe course of business, at Mr. Babcock\xe2\x80\x99s birthplace, and, for reasons\r\ntoo recondite to unfold, his visit there always assumed in his mind a\r\njocular cast. To carry out his joke, which certainly seems poor so long\r\nas it is not explained, he used often to address his companion as\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDorchester.\xe2\x80\x9d Fellow-travelers very soon grow intimate but it is highly\r\nimprobable that at home these extremely dissimilar characters would\r\nhave found any very convenient points of contact. They were, indeed, as\r\ndifferent as possible. Newman, who never reflected on such matters,\r\naccepted the situation with great equanimity, but Babcock used to\r\nmeditate over it privately; used often, indeed, to retire to his room\r\nearly in the evening for the express purpose of considering it\r\nconscientiously and impartially. He was not sure that it was a good\r\nthing for him to associate with our hero, whose way of taking life was\r\nso little his own. Newman was an excellent, generous fellow; Mr.\r\nBabcock sometimes said to himself that he was a _noble_ fellow, and,\r\ncertainly, it was impossible not to like him. But would it not be\r\ndesirable to try to exert an influence upon him, to try to quicken his\r\nmoral life and sharpen his sense of duty? He liked everything, he\r\naccepted everything, he found amusement in everything; he was not\r\ndiscriminating, he had not a high tone. The young man from Dorchester\r\naccused Newman of a fault which he considered very grave, and which he\r\ndid his best to avoid: what he would have called a want of \xe2\x80\x9cmoral\r\nreaction.\xe2\x80\x9d Poor Mr. Babcock was extremely fond of pictures and\r\nchurches, and carried Mrs. Jameson\xe2\x80\x99s works about in his trunk; he\r\ndelighted in \xc3\xa6sthetic analysis, and received peculiar impressions from\r\neverything he saw. But nevertheless in his secret soul he detested\r\nEurope, and he felt an irritating need to protest against Newman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngross intellectual hospitality. Mr. Babcock\xe2\x80\x99s moral _malaise_, I am\r\nafraid, lay deeper than where any definition of mine can reach it. He\r\nmistrusted the European temperament, he suffered from the European\r\nclimate, he hated the European dinner-hour; European life seemed to him\r\nunscrupulous and impure. And yet he had an exquisite sense of beauty;\r\nand as beauty was often inextricably associated with the above\r\ndispleasing conditions, as he wished, above all, to be just and\r\ndispassionate, and as he was, furthermore, extremely devoted to\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cculture,\xe2\x80\x9d he could not bring himself to decide that Europe was utterly\r\nbad. But he thought it was very bad indeed, and his quarrel with Newman\r\nwas that this unregulated epicure had a sadly insufficient perception\r\nof the bad. Babcock himself really knew as little about the bad, in any\r\nquarter of the world, as a nursing infant, his most vivid realization\r\nof evil had been the discovery that one of his college classmates, who\r\nwas studying architecture in Paris had a love affair with a young woman\r\nwho did not expect him to marry her. Babcock had related this incident\r\nto Newman, and our hero had applied an epithet of an unflattering sort\r\nto the young girl. The next day his companion asked him whether he was\r\nvery sure he had used exactly the right word to characterize the young\r\narchitect\xe2\x80\x99s mistress. Newman stared and laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are a great\r\nmany words to express that idea,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cyou can take your choice!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I mean,\xe2\x80\x9d said Babcock, \xe2\x80\x9cwas she possibly not to be considered in a\r\ndifferent light? Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think she _really_ expected him to marry\r\nher?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sure I don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cVery likely she did; I have no\r\ndoubt she is a grand woman.\xe2\x80\x9d And he began to laugh again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that either,\xe2\x80\x9d said Babcock, \xe2\x80\x9cI was only afraid that I\r\nmight have seemed yesterday not to remember\xe2\x80\x94not to consider; well, I\r\nthink I will write to Percival about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he had written to Percival (who answered him in a really impudent\r\nfashion), and he had reflected that it was somehow, raw and reckless in\r\nNewman to assume in that off-hand manner that the young woman in Paris\r\nmight be \xe2\x80\x9cgrand.\xe2\x80\x9d The brevity of Newman\xe2\x80\x99s judgments very often shocked\r\nand discomposed him. He had a way of damning people without farther\r\nappeal, or of pronouncing them capital company in the face of\r\nuncomfortable symptoms, which seemed unworthy of a man whose conscience\r\nhad been properly cultivated. And yet poor Babcock liked him, and\r\nremembered that even if he was sometimes perplexing and painful, this\r\nwas not a reason for giving him up. Goethe recommended seeing human\r\nnature in the most various forms, and Mr. Babcock thought Goethe\r\nperfectly splendid. He often tried, in odd half-hours of conversation\r\nto infuse into Newman a little of his own spiritual starch, but\r\nNewman\xe2\x80\x99s personal texture was too loose to admit of stiffening. His\r\nmind could no more hold principles than a sieve can hold water. He\r\nadmired principles extremely, and thought Babcock a mighty fine little\r\nfellow for having so many. He accepted all that his high-strung\r\ncompanion offered him, and put them away in what he supposed to be a\r\nvery safe place; but poor Babcock never afterwards recognized his gifts\r\namong the articles that Newman had in daily use.\r\n\r\nThey traveled together through Germany and into Switzerland, where for\r\nthree or four weeks they trudged over passes and lounged upon blue\r\nlakes. At last they crossed the Simplon and made their way to Venice.\r\nMr. Babcock had become gloomy and even a trifle irritable; he seemed\r\nmoody, absent, preoccupied; he got his plans into a tangle, and talked\r\none moment of doing one thing and the next of doing another. Newman led\r\nhis usual life, made acquaintances, took his ease in the galleries and\r\nchurches, spent an unconscionable amount of time in strolling in the\r\nPiazza San Marco, bought a great many bad pictures, and for a fortnight\r\nenjoyed Venice grossly. One evening, coming back to his inn, he found\r\nBabcock waiting for him in the little garden beside it. The young man\r\nwalked up to him, looking very dismal, thrust out his hand, and said\r\nwith solemnity that he was afraid they must part. Newman expressed his\r\nsurprise and regret, and asked why a parting had become necessary.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid I\xe2\x80\x99m tired of you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not tired of me?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Babcock, fixing him with his clear\r\ngray eye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy the deuce should I be? You are a very plucky fellow. Besides, I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t grow tired of things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t understand each other,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young minister.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t I understand you?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I hoped I did. But what\r\nif I don\xe2\x80\x99t; where\xe2\x80\x99s the harm?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand _you_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Babcock. And he sat down and rested\r\nhis head on his hand, and looked up mournfully at his immeasurable\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh Lord, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind that!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Newman, with a laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it\xe2\x80\x99s very distressing to me. It keeps me in a state of unrest. It\r\nirritates me; I can\xe2\x80\x99t settle anything. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s good for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou worry too much; that\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course it must seem so to you. You think I take things too hard,\r\nand I think you take things too easily. We can never agree.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut we have agreed very well all along.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t agreed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Babcock, shaking his head. \xe2\x80\x9cI am very\r\nuncomfortable. I ought to have separated from you a month ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, horrors! I\xe2\x80\x99ll agree to anything!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Newman.\r\n\r\nMr. Babcock buried his head in both hands. At last looking up, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink you appreciate my position,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI try to arrive at the\r\ntruth about everything. And then you go too fast. For me, you are too\r\npassionate, too extravagant. I feel as if I ought to go over all this\r\nground we have traversed again, by myself, alone. I am afraid I have\r\nmade a great many mistakes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you needn\xe2\x80\x99t give so many reasons,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are simply\r\ntired of my company. You have a good right to be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, I am not tired!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the pestered young divine. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is very\r\nwrong to be tired.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI give it up!\xe2\x80\x9d laughed Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cBut of course it will never do to go\r\non making mistakes. Go your way, by all means. I shall miss you; but\r\nyou have seen I make friends very easily. You will be lonely yourself;\r\nbut drop me a line, when you feel like it, and I will wait for you\r\nanywhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I will go back to Milan. I am afraid I didn\xe2\x80\x99t do justice to\r\nLuini.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor Luini!\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean that I am afraid I overestimated him. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that he is\r\na painter of the first rank.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLuini?\xe2\x80\x9d Newman exclaimed; \xe2\x80\x9cwhy, he\xe2\x80\x99s enchanting\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s magnificent!\r\nThere is something in his genius that is like a beautiful woman. It\r\ngives one the same feeling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Babcock frowned and winced. And it must be added that this was, for\r\nNewman, an unusually metaphysical flight; but in passing through Milan\r\nhe had taken a great fancy to the painter. \xe2\x80\x9cThere you are again!\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMr. Babcock. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, we had better separate.\xe2\x80\x9d And on the morrow he\r\nretraced his steps and proceeded to tone down his impressions of the\r\ngreat Lombard artist.\r\n\r\nA few days afterwards Newman received a note from his late companion\r\nwhich ran as follows:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nMy Dear Mr. Newman,\xe2\x80\x94I am afraid that my conduct at Venice, a week ago,\r\nseemed to you strange and ungrateful, and I wish to explain my\r\nposition, which, as I said at the time, I do not think you appreciate.\r\nI had long had it on my mind to propose that we should part company,\r\nand this step was not really so abrupt as it seemed. In the first\r\nplace, you know, I am traveling in Europe on funds supplied by my\r\ncongregation, who kindly offered me a vacation and an opportunity to\r\nenrich my mind with the treasures of nature and art in the Old World. I\r\nfeel, therefore, as if I ought to use my time to the very best\r\nadvantage. I have a high sense of responsibility. You appear to care\r\nonly for the pleasure of the hour, and you give yourself up to it with\r\na violence which I confess I am not able to emulate. I feel as if I\r\nmust arrive at some conclusion and fix my belief on certain points. Art\r\nand life seem to me intensely serious things, and in our travels in\r\nEurope we should especially remember the immense seriousness of Art.\r\nYou seem to hold that if a thing amuses you for the moment, that is all\r\nyou need ask for it, and your relish for mere amusement is also much\r\nhigher than mine. You put, however, a kind of reckless confidence into\r\nyour pleasure which at times, I confess, has seemed to me\xe2\x80\x94shall I say\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x94almost cynical. Your way at any rate is not my way, and it is\r\nunwise that we should attempt any longer to pull together. And yet, let\r\nme add that I know there is a great deal to be said for your way; I\r\nhave felt its attraction, in your society, very strongly. But for this\r\nI should have left you long ago. But I was so perplexed. I hope I have\r\nnot done wrong. I feel as if I had a great deal of lost time to make\r\nup. I beg you take all this as I mean it, which, Heaven knows, is not\r\ninvidiously. I have a great personal esteem for you and hope that some\r\nday, when I have recovered my balance, we shall meet again. I hope you\r\nwill continue to enjoy your travels, only _do_ remember that Life and\r\nArt _are_ extremely serious. Believe me your sincere friend and\r\nwell-wisher,\r\n\r\nBENJAMIN BABCOCK\r\n\r\nP. S. I am greatly perplexed by Luini.\r\n\r\nThis letter produced in Newman\xe2\x80\x99s mind a singular mixture of\r\nexhilaration and awe. At first, Mr. Babcock\xe2\x80\x99s tender conscience seemed\r\nto him a capital farce, and his traveling back to Milan only to get\r\ninto a deeper muddle appeared, as the reward of his pedantry,\r\nexquisitely and ludicrously just. Then Newman reflected that these are\r\nmighty mysteries, that possibly he himself was indeed that baleful and\r\nbarely mentionable thing, a cynic, and that his manner of considering\r\nthe treasures of art and the privileges of life was probably very base\r\nand immoral. Newman had a great contempt for immorality, and that\r\nevening, for a good half hour, as he sat watching the star-sheen on the\r\nwarm Adriatic, he felt rebuked and depressed. He was at a loss how to\r\nanswer Babcock\xe2\x80\x99s letter. His good nature checked his resenting the\r\nyoung minister\xe2\x80\x99s lofty admonitions, and his tough, inelastic sense of\r\nhumor forbade his taking them seriously. He wrote no answer at all but\r\na day or two afterward he found in a curiosity shop a grotesque little\r\nstatuette in ivory, of the sixteenth century, which he sent off to\r\nBabcock without a commentary. It represented a gaunt, ascetic-looking\r\nmonk, in a tattered gown and cowl, kneeling with clasped hands and\r\npulling a portentously long face. It was a wonderfully delicate piece\r\nof carving, and in a moment, through one of the rents of his gown, you\r\nespied a fat capon hung round the monk\xe2\x80\x99s waist. In Newman\xe2\x80\x99s intention\r\nwhat did the figure symbolize? Did it mean that he was going to try to\r\nbe as \xe2\x80\x9chigh-toned\xe2\x80\x9d as the monk looked at first, but that he feared he\r\nshould succeed no better than the friar, on a closer inspection, proved\r\nto have done? It is not supposable that he intended a satire upon\r\nBabcock\xe2\x80\x99s own asceticism, for this would have been a truly cynical\r\nstroke. He made his late companion, at any rate, a very valuable little\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nNewman, on leaving Venice, went through the Tyrol to Vienna, and then\r\nreturned westward, through Southern Germany. The autumn found him at\r\nBaden-Baden, where he spent several weeks. The place was charming, and\r\nhe was in no hurry to depart; besides, he was looking about him and\r\ndeciding what to do for the winter. His summer had been very full, and\r\nhe sat under the great trees beside the miniature river that trickles\r\npast the Baden flower-beds, he slowly rummaged it over. He had seen and\r\ndone a great deal, enjoyed and observed a great deal; he felt older,\r\nand yet he felt younger too. He remembered Mr. Babcock and his desire\r\nto form conclusions, and he remembered also that he had profited very\r\nlittle by his friend\xe2\x80\x99s exhortation to cultivate the same respectable\r\nhabit. Could he not scrape together a few conclusions? Baden-Baden was\r\nthe prettiest place he had seen yet, and orchestral music in the\r\nevening, under the stars, was decidedly a great institution. This was\r\none of his conclusions! But he went on to reflect that he had done very\r\nwisely to pull up stakes and come abroad; this seeing of the world was\r\na very interesting thing. He had learned a great deal; he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t say\r\njust what, but he had it there under his hat-band. He had done what he\r\nwanted; he had seen the great things, and he had given his mind a\r\nchance to \xe2\x80\x9cimprove,\xe2\x80\x9d if it would. He cheerfully believed that it had\r\nimproved. Yes, this seeing of the world was very pleasant, and he would\r\nwillingly do a little more of it. Thirty-six years old as he was, he\r\nhad a handsome stretch of life before him yet, and he need not begin to\r\ncount his weeks. Where should he take the world next? I have said he\r\nremembered the eyes of the lady whom he had found standing in Mrs.\r\nTristram\xe2\x80\x99s drawing-room; four months had elapsed, and he had not\r\nforgotten them yet. He had looked\xe2\x80\x94he had made a point of looking\xe2\x80\x94into a\r\ngreat many other eyes in the interval, but the only ones he thought of\r\nnow were Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s. If he wanted to see more of the world,\r\nshould he find it in Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s eyes? He would certainly find\r\nsomething there, call it this world or the next. Throughout these\r\nrather formless meditations he sometimes thought of his past life and\r\nthe long array of years (they had begun so early) during which he had\r\nhad nothing in his head but \xe2\x80\x9centerprise.\xe2\x80\x9d They seemed far away now, for\r\nhis present attitude was more than a holiday, it was almost a rupture.\r\nHe had told Tristram that the pendulum was swinging back and it\r\nappeared that the backward swing had not yet ended. Still \xe2\x80\x9centerprise,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwhich was over in the other quarter wore to his mind a different aspect\r\nat different hours. In its train a thousand forgotten episodes came\r\ntrooping back into his memory. Some of them he looked complacently\r\nenough in the face; from some he averted his head. They were old\r\nefforts, old exploits, antiquated examples of \xe2\x80\x9csmartness\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nsharpness. Some of them, as he looked at them, he felt decidedly proud\r\nof; he admired himself as if he had been looking at another man. And,\r\nin fact, many of the qualities that make a great deed were there: the\r\ndecision, the resolution, the courage, the celerity, the clear eye, and\r\nthe strong hand. Of certain other achievements it would be going too\r\nfar to say that he was ashamed of them for Newman had never had a\r\nstomach for dirty work. He was blessed with a natural impulse to\r\ndisfigure with a direct, unreasoning blow the comely visage of\r\ntemptation. And certainly, in no man could a want of integrity have\r\nbeen less excusable. Newman knew the crooked from the straight at a\r\nglance, and the former had cost him, first and last, a great many\r\nmoments of lively disgust. But none the less some of his memories\r\nseemed to wear at present a rather graceless and sordid mien, and it\r\nstruck him that if he had never done anything very ugly, he had never,\r\non the other hand, done anything particularly beautiful. He had spent\r\nhis years in the unremitting effort to add thousands to thousands, and,\r\nnow that he stood well outside of it, the business of money-getting\r\nappeared tolerably dry and sterile. It is very well to sneer at\r\nmoney-getting after you have filled your pockets, and Newman, it may be\r\nsaid, should have begun somewhat earlier to moralize thus delicately.\r\nTo this it may be answered that he might have made another fortune, if\r\nhe chose; and we ought to add that he was not exactly moralizing. It\r\nhad come back to him simply that what he had been looking at all summer\r\nwas a very rich and beautiful world, and that it had not all been made\r\nby sharp railroad men and stock-brokers.\r\n\r\nDuring his stay at Baden-Baden he received a letter from Mrs. Tristram,\r\nscolding him for the scanty tidings he had sent to his friends of the\r\nAvenue d\xe2\x80\x99I\xc3\xa9na, and begging to be definitely informed that he had not\r\nconcocted any horrid scheme for wintering in outlying regions, but was\r\ncoming back sanely and promptly to the most comfortable city in the\r\nworld. Newman\xe2\x80\x99s answer ran as follows:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI supposed you knew I was a miserable letter-writer, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t expect\r\nanything of me. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I have written twenty letters of pure\r\nfriendship in my whole life; in America I conducted my correspondence\r\naltogether by telegrams. This is a letter of pure friendship; you have\r\ngot hold of a curiosity, and I hope you will value it. You want to know\r\neverything that has happened to me these three months. The best way to\r\ntell you, I think, would be to send you my half dozen guide-books, with\r\nmy pencil-marks in the margin. Wherever you find a scratch or a cross,\r\nor a \xe2\x80\x98Beautiful!\xe2\x80\x99 or a \xe2\x80\x98So true!\xe2\x80\x99 or a \xe2\x80\x98Too thin!\xe2\x80\x99 you may know that I\r\nhave had a sensation of some sort or other. That has been about my\r\nhistory, ever since I left you. Belgium, Holland, Switzerland, Germany,\r\nItaly\xe2\x80\x94I have been through the whole list, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I am any\r\nthe worse for it. I know more about Madonnas and church-steeples than I\r\nsupposed any man could. I have seen some very pretty things, and shall\r\nperhaps talk them over this winter, by your fireside. You see, my face\r\nis not altogether set against Paris. I have had all kinds of plans and\r\nvisions, but your letter has blown most of them away. \xe2\x80\x98_L\xe2\x80\x99app\xc3\xa9tit vient\r\nen mangeant_,\xe2\x80\x99 says the French proverb, and I find that the more I see\r\nof the world the more I want to see. Now that I am in the shafts, why\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I trot to the end of the course? Sometimes I think of the far\r\nEast, and keep rolling the names of Eastern cities under my tongue:\r\nDamascus and Bagdad, Medina and Mecca. I spent a week last month in the\r\ncompany of a returned missionary, who told me I ought to be ashamed to\r\nbe loafing about Europe when there are such big things to be seen out\r\nthere. I do want to explore, but I think I would rather explore over in\r\nthe Rue de l\xe2\x80\x99Universit\xc3\xa9. Do you ever hear from that pretty lady? If you\r\ncan get her to promise she will be at home the next time I call, I will\r\ngo back to Paris straight. I am more than ever in the state of mind I\r\ntold you about that evening; I want a first-class wife. I have kept an\r\neye on all the pretty girls I have come across this summer, but none of\r\nthem came up to my notion, or anywhere near it. I should have enjoyed\r\nall this a thousand times more if I had had the lady just mentioned by\r\nmy side. The nearest approach to her was a Unitarian minister from\r\nBoston, who very soon demanded a separation, for incompatibility of\r\ntemper. He told me I was low-minded, immoral, a devotee of \xe2\x80\x98art for\r\nart\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94whatever that is: all of which greatly afflicted me, for he was\r\nreally a sweet little fellow. But shortly afterwards I met an\r\nEnglishman, with whom I struck up an acquaintance which at first seemed\r\nto promise well\xe2\x80\x94a very bright man, who writes in the London papers and\r\nknows Paris nearly as well as Tristram. We knocked about for a week\r\ntogether, but he very soon gave me up in disgust. I was too virtuous by\r\nhalf; I was too stern a moralist. He told me, in a friendly way, that I\r\nwas cursed with a conscience; that I judged things like a Methodist and\r\ntalked about them like an old lady. This was rather bewildering. Which\r\nof my two critics was I to believe? I didn\xe2\x80\x99t worry about it and very\r\nsoon made up my mind they were both idiots. But there is one thing in\r\nwhich no one will ever have the impudence to pretend I am wrong, that\r\nis, in being your faithful friend,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\nNewman gave up Damascus and Bagdad and returned to Paris before the\r\nautumn was over. He established himself in some rooms selected for him\r\nby Tom Tristram, in accordance with the latter\xe2\x80\x99s estimate of what he\r\ncalled his social position. When Newman learned that his social\r\nposition was to be taken into account, he professed himself utterly\r\nincompetent, and begged Tristram to relieve him of the care. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow I had a social position,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand if I have, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t the\r\nsmallest idea what it is. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t a social position knowing some two or\r\nthree thousand people and inviting them to dinner? I know you and your\r\nwife and little old Mr. Nioche, who gave me French lessons last spring.\r\nCan I invite you to dinner to meet each other? If I can, you must come\r\nto-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is not very grateful to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Tristram, \xe2\x80\x9cwho introduced\r\nyou last year to every creature I know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you did; I had quite forgotten. But I thought you wanted me to\r\nforget,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, with that tone of simple deliberateness which\r\nfrequently marked his utterance, and which an observer would not have\r\nknown whether to pronounce a somewhat mysteriously humorous affection\r\nof ignorance or a modest aspiration to knowledge; \xe2\x80\x9cyou told me you\r\ndisliked them all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, the way you remember what I say is at least very flattering. But\r\nin future,\xe2\x80\x9d added Mrs. Tristram, \xe2\x80\x9cpray forget all the wicked things and\r\nremember only the good ones. It will be easily done, and it will not\r\nfatigue your memory. But I forewarn you that if you trust my husband to\r\npick out your rooms, you are in for something hideous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHideous, darling?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Tristram.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-day I must say nothing wicked; otherwise I should use stronger\r\nlanguage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think she would say, Newman?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Tristram. \xe2\x80\x9cIf she\r\nreally tried, now? She can express displeasure, volubly, in two or\r\nthree languages; that\xe2\x80\x99s what it is to be intellectual. It gives her the\r\nstart of me completely, for I can\xe2\x80\x99t swear, for the life of me, except\r\nin English. When I get mad I have to fall back on our dear old mother\r\ntongue. There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing like it, after all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman declared that he knew nothing about tables and chairs, and that\r\nhe would accept, in the way of a lodging, with his eyes shut, anything\r\nthat Tristram should offer him. This was partly veracity on our hero\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npart, but it was also partly charity. He knew that to pry about and\r\nlook at rooms, and make people open windows, and poke into sofas with\r\nhis cane, and gossip with landladies, and ask who lived above and who\r\nbelow\xe2\x80\x94he knew that this was of all pastimes the dearest to Tristram\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nheart, and he felt the more disposed to put it in his way as he was\r\nconscious that, as regards his obliging friend, he had suffered the\r\nwarmth of ancient good-fellowship somewhat to abate. Besides, he had no\r\ntaste for upholstery; he had even no very exquisite sense of comfort or\r\nconvenience. He had a relish for luxury and splendor, but it was\r\nsatisfied by rather gross contrivances. He scarcely knew a hard chair\r\nfrom a soft one, and he possessed a talent for stretching his legs\r\nwhich quite dispensed with adventitious facilities. His idea of comfort\r\nwas to inhabit very large rooms, have a great many of them, and be\r\nconscious of their possessing a number of patented mechanical\r\ndevices\xe2\x80\x94half of which he should never have occasion to use. The\r\napartments should be light and brilliant and lofty; he had once said\r\nthat he liked rooms in which you wanted to keep your hat on. For the\r\nrest, he was satisfied with the assurance of any respectable person\r\nthat everything was \xe2\x80\x9chandsome.\xe2\x80\x9d Tristram accordingly secured for him an\r\napartment to which this epithet might be lavishly applied. It was\r\nsituated on the Boulevard Haussmann, on the first floor, and consisted\r\nof a series of rooms, gilded from floor to ceiling a foot thick, draped\r\nin various light shades of satin, and chiefly furnished with mirrors\r\nand clocks. Newman thought them magnificent, thanked Tristram heartily,\r\nimmediately took possession, and had one of his trunks standing for\r\nthree months in his drawing-room.\r\n\r\nOne day Mrs. Tristram told him that her beautiful friend, Madame de\r\nCintr\xc3\xa9, had returned from the country; that she had met her three days\r\nbefore, coming out of the Church of St. Sulpice; she herself having\r\njourneyed to that distant quarter in quest of an obscure lace-mender,\r\nof whose skill she had heard high praise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how were those eyes?\xe2\x80\x9d Newman asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose eyes were red with weeping, if you please!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Tristram.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe had been to confession.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t tally with your account of her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, \xe2\x80\x9cthat she\r\nshould have sins to confess.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey were not sins; they were sufferings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe asked me to come and see her; I went this morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what does she suffer from?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t ask her. With her, somehow, one is very discreet. But I\r\nguessed, easily enough. She suffers from her wicked old mother and her\r\nGrand Turk of a brother. They persecute her. But I can almost forgive\r\nthem, because, as I told you, she is a saint, and a persecution is all\r\nthat she needs to bring out her saintliness and make her perfect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a comfortable theory for her. I hope you will never impart it\r\nto the old folks. Why does she let them bully her? Is she not her own\r\nmistress?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLegally, yes, I suppose; but morally, no. In France you must never say\r\nnay to your mother, whatever she requires of you. She may be the most\r\nabominable old woman in the world, and make your life a purgatory; but,\r\nafter all, she is _ma m\xc3\xa8re_, and you have no right to judge her. You\r\nhave simply to obey. The thing has a fine side to it. Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9\r\nbows her head and folds her wings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t she at least make her brother leave off?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer brother is the _chef de la famille_, as they say; he is the head\r\nof the clan. With those people the family is everything; you must act,\r\nnot for your own pleasure, but for the advantage of the family.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder what _my_ family would like me to do!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Tristram.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you had one!\xe2\x80\x9d said his wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what do they want to get out of that poor lady?\xe2\x80\x9d Newman asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnother marriage. They are not rich, and they want to bring more money\r\ninto the family.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s your chance, my boy!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tristram.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 objects,\xe2\x80\x9d Newman continued.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has been sold once; she naturally objects to being sold again. It\r\nappears that the first time they made rather a poor bargain; M. de\r\nCintr\xc3\xa9 left a scanty property.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd to whom do they want to marry her now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought it best not to ask; but you may be sure it is to some horrid\r\nold nabob, or to some dissipated little duke.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s Mrs. Tristram, as large as life!\xe2\x80\x9d cried her husband. \xe2\x80\x9cObserve\r\nthe richness of her imagination. She has not a single question\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvulgar to ask questions\xe2\x80\x94and yet she knows everything. She has the\r\nhistory of Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s marriage at her fingers\xe2\x80\x99 ends. She has\r\nseen the lovely Claire on her knees, with loosened tresses and\r\nstreaming eyes, and the rest of them standing over her with spikes and\r\ngoads and red-hot irons, ready to come down on her if she refuses the\r\ntipsy duke. The simple truth is that they made a fuss about her\r\nmilliner\xe2\x80\x99s bill or refused her an opera-box.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman looked from Tristram to his wife with a certain mistrust in each\r\ndirection. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you really mean,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked of Mrs. Tristram, \xe2\x80\x9cthat your\r\nfriend is being forced into an unhappy marriage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think it extremely probable. Those people are very capable of that\r\nsort of thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is like something in a play,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman; \xe2\x80\x9cthat dark old house\r\nover there looks as if wicked things had been done in it, and might be\r\ndone again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey have a still darker old house in the country Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9\r\ntells me, and there, during the summer this scheme must have been\r\nhatched.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Must_ have been; mind that!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tristram.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter all,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Newman, after a silence, \xe2\x80\x9cshe may be in trouble\r\nabout something else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it is something else, then it is something worse,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs.\r\nTristram, with rich decision.\r\n\r\nNewman was silent a while, and seemed lost in meditation. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it\r\npossible,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked at last, \xe2\x80\x9cthat they do that sort of thing over\r\nhere? that helpless women are bullied into marrying men they hate?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHelpless women, all over the world, have a hard time of it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs.\r\nTristram. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is plenty of bullying everywhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA great deal of that kind of thing goes on in New York,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nTristram. \xe2\x80\x9cGirls are bullied or coaxed or bribed, or all three\r\ntogether, into marrying nasty fellows. There is no end of that always\r\ngoing on in the Fifth Avenue, and other bad things besides. The\r\nMysteries of the Fifth Avenue! Someone ought to show them up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it!\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, very gravely. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that,\r\nin America, girls are ever subjected to compulsion. I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe\r\nthere have been a dozen cases of it since the country began.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen to the voice of the spread eagle!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Tristram.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe spread eagle ought to use his wings,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Tristram. \xe2\x80\x9cFly to\r\nthe rescue of Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo her rescue?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPounce down, seize her in your talons, and carry her off. Marry her\r\nyourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman, for some moments, answered nothing; but presently, \xe2\x80\x9cI should\r\nsuppose she had heard enough of marrying,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe kindest way to\r\ntreat her would be to admire her, and yet never to speak of it. But\r\nthat sort of thing is infamous,\xe2\x80\x9d he added; \xe2\x80\x9cit makes me feel savage to\r\nhear of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe heard of it, however, more than once afterward. Mrs. Tristram again\r\nsaw Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9, and again found her looking very sad. But on\r\nthese occasions there had been no tears; her beautiful eyes were clear\r\nand still. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is cold, calm, and hopeless,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Tristram declared,\r\nand she added that on her mentioning that her friend Mr. Newman was\r\nagain in Paris and was faithful in his desire to make Madame de\r\nCintr\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s acquaintance, this lovely woman had found a smile in her\r\ndespair, and declared that she was sorry to have missed his visit in\r\nthe spring and that she hoped he had not lost courage. \xe2\x80\x9cI told her\r\nsomething about you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Tristram.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a comfort,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, placidly. \xe2\x80\x9cI like people to know about\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA few days after this, one dusky autumn afternoon, he went again to the\r\nRue de l\xe2\x80\x99Universit\xc3\xa9. The early evening had closed in as he applied for\r\nadmittance at the stoutly guarded _H\xc3\xb4tel de Bellegarde_. He was told\r\nthat Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 was at home; he crossed the court, entered the\r\nfarther door, and was conducted through a vestibule, vast, dim, and\r\ncold, up a broad stone staircase with an ancient iron balustrade, to an\r\napartment on the second floor. Announced and ushered in, he found\r\nhimself in a sort of paneled boudoir, at one end of which a lady and\r\ngentleman were seated before the fire. The gentleman was smoking a\r\ncigarette; there was no light in the room save that of a couple of\r\ncandles and the glow from the hearth. Both persons rose to welcome\r\nNewman, who, in the firelight, recognized Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9. She gave\r\nhim her hand with a smile which seemed in itself an illumination, and,\r\npointing to her companion, said softly, \xe2\x80\x9cMy brother.\xe2\x80\x9d The gentleman\r\noffered Newman a frank, friendly greeting, and our hero then perceived\r\nhim to be the young man who had spoken to him in the court of the hotel\r\non his former visit and who had struck him as a good fellow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Tristram has spoken to me a great deal of you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de\r\nCintr\xc3\xa9 gently, as she resumed her former place.\r\n\r\nNewman, after he had seated himself, began to consider what, in truth,\r\nwas his errand. He had an unusual, unexpected sense of having wandered\r\ninto a strange corner of the world. He was not given, as a general\r\nthing, to anticipating danger, or forecasting disaster, and he had had\r\nno social tremors on this particular occasion. He was not timid and he\r\nwas not impudent. He felt too kindly toward himself to be the one, and\r\ntoo good-naturedly toward the rest of the world to be the other. But\r\nhis native shrewdness sometimes placed his ease of temper at its mercy;\r\nwith every disposition to take things simply, it was obliged to\r\nperceive that some things were not so simple as others. He felt as one\r\ndoes in missing a step, in an ascent, where one expected to find it.\r\nThis strange, pretty woman, sitting in fire-side talk with her brother,\r\nin the gray depths of her inhospitable-looking house\xe2\x80\x94what had he to say\r\nto her? She seemed enveloped in a sort of fantastic privacy; on what\r\ngrounds had he pulled away the curtain? For a moment he felt as if he\r\nhad plunged into some medium as deep as the ocean, and as if he must\r\nexert himself to keep from sinking. Meanwhile he was looking at Madame\r\nde Cintr\xc3\xa9, and she was settling herself in her chair and drawing in her\r\nlong dress and turning her face towards him. Their eyes met; a moment\r\nafterwards she looked away and motioned to her brother to put a log on\r\nthe fire. But the moment, and the glance which traversed it, had been\r\nsufficient to relieve Newman of the first and the last fit of personal\r\nembarrassment he was ever to know. He performed the movement which was\r\nso frequent with him, and which was always a sort of symbol of his\r\ntaking mental possession of a scene\xe2\x80\x94he extended his legs. The\r\nimpression Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 had made upon him on their first meeting\r\ncame back in an instant; it had been deeper than he knew. She was\r\npleasing, she was interesting; he had opened a book and the first lines\r\nheld his attention.\r\n\r\nShe asked him several questions: how lately he had seen Mrs. Tristram,\r\nhow long he had been in Paris, how long he expected to remain there,\r\nhow he liked it. She spoke English without an accent, or rather with\r\nthat distinctively British accent which, on his arrival in Europe, had\r\nstruck Newman as an altogether foreign tongue, but which, in women, he\r\nhad come to like extremely. Here and there Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s utterance\r\nhad a faint shade of strangeness but at the end of ten minutes Newman\r\nfound himself waiting for these soft roughnesses. He enjoyed them, and\r\nhe marveled to see that gross thing, error, brought down to so fine a\r\npoint.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have a beautiful country,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9, presently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, magnificent!\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to see it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall never see it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 with a smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t travel; especially so far.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you go away sometimes; you are not always here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI go away in summer, a little way, to the country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman wanted to ask her something more, something personal, he hardly\r\nknew what. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you find it rather\xe2\x80\x94rather quiet here?\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cso\r\nfar from the street?\xe2\x80\x9d Rather \xe2\x80\x9cgloomy,\xe2\x80\x9d he was going to say, but he\r\nreflected that that would be impolite.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it is very quiet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9; \xe2\x80\x9cbut we like that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you like that,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Newman, slowly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBesides, I have lived here all my life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLived here all your life,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, in the same way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was born here, and my father was born here before me, and my\r\ngrandfather, and my great-grandfathers. Were they not, Valentin?\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nshe appealed to her brother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it\xe2\x80\x99s a family habit to be born here!\xe2\x80\x9d the young man said with a\r\nlaugh, and rose and threw the remnant of his cigarette into the fire,\r\nand then remained leaning against the chimney-piece. An observer would\r\nhave perceived that he wished to take a better look at Newman, whom he\r\ncovertly examined, while he stood stroking his moustache.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour house is tremendously old, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow old is it, brother?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9.\r\n\r\nThe young man took the two candles from the mantel-shelf, lifted one\r\nhigh in each hand, and looked up toward the cornice of the room, above\r\nthe chimney-piece. This latter feature of the apartment was of white\r\nmarble, and in the familiar rococo style of the last century; but above\r\nit was a paneling of an earlier date, quaintly carved, painted white,\r\nand gilded here and there. The white had turned to yellow, and the\r\ngilding was tarnished. On the top, the figures ranged themselves into a\r\nsort of shield, on which an armorial device was cut. Above it, in\r\nrelief, was a date\xe2\x80\x941627. \xe2\x80\x9cThere you have it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\r\nis old or new, according to your point of view.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, over here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, \xe2\x80\x9cone\xe2\x80\x99s point of view gets shifted round\r\nconsiderably.\xe2\x80\x9d And he threw back his head and looked about the room.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour house is of a very curious style of architecture,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you interested in architecture?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the young man at the\r\nchimney-piece.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I took the trouble, this summer,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, \xe2\x80\x9cto examine\xe2\x80\x94as\r\nwell as I can calculate\xe2\x80\x94some four hundred and seventy churches. Do you\r\ncall that interested?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you are interested in theology,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot particularly. Are you a Roman Catholic, madam?\xe2\x80\x9d And he turned to\r\nMadame de Cintr\xc3\xa9.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, gravely.\r\n\r\nNewman was struck with the gravity of her tone; he threw back his head\r\nand began to look round the room again. \xe2\x80\x9cHad you never noticed that\r\nnumber up there?\xe2\x80\x9d he presently asked.\r\n\r\nShe hesitated a moment, and then, \xe2\x80\x9cIn former years,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nHer brother had been watching Newman\xe2\x80\x99s movement. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you would\r\nlike to examine the house,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nNewman slowly brought down his eyes and looked at him; he had a vague\r\nimpression that the young man at the chimney-piece was inclined to\r\nirony. He was a handsome fellow, his face wore a smile, his moustaches\r\nwere curled up at the ends, and there was a little dancing gleam in his\r\neye. \xe2\x80\x9cDamn his French impudence!\xe2\x80\x9d Newman was on the point of saying to\r\nhimself. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat the deuce is he grinning at?\xe2\x80\x9d He glanced at Madame de\r\nCintr\xc3\xa9; she was sitting with her eyes fixed on the floor. She raised\r\nthem, they met his, and she looked at her brother. Newman turned again\r\nto this young man and observed that he strikingly resembled his sister.\r\nThis was in his favor, and our hero\xe2\x80\x99s first impression of the Count\r\nValentin, moreover, had been agreeable. His mistrust expired, and he\r\nsaid he would be very glad to see the house.\r\n\r\nThe young man gave a frank laugh, and laid his hand on one of the\r\ncandlesticks. \xe2\x80\x9cGood, good!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cCome, then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 rose quickly and grasped his arm, \xe2\x80\x9cAh, Valentin!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo show Mr. Newman the house. It will be very amusing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe kept her hand on his arm, and turned to Newman with a smile. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlet him take you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cyou will not find it amusing. It is a\r\nmusty old house, like any other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is full of curious things,\xe2\x80\x9d said the count, resisting. \xe2\x80\x9cBesides, I\r\nwant to do it; it is a rare chance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are very wicked, brother,\xe2\x80\x9d Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing venture, nothing have!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the young man. \xe2\x80\x9cWill you come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 stepped toward Newman, gently clasping her hands and\r\nsmiling softly. \xe2\x80\x9cWould you not prefer my society, here, by my fire, to\r\nstumbling about dark passages after my brother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA hundred times!\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cWe will see the house some other day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man put down his candlestick with mock solemnity, and,\r\nshaking his head, \xe2\x80\x9cAh, you have defeated a great scheme, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA scheme? I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou would have played your part in it all the better. Perhaps some day\r\nI shall have a chance to explain it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe quiet, and ring for the tea,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9.\r\n\r\nThe young man obeyed, and presently a servant brought in the tea,\r\nplaced the tray on a small table, and departed. Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9, from\r\nher place, busied herself with making it. She had but just begun when\r\nthe door was thrown open and a lady rushed in, making a loud rustling\r\nsound. She stared at Newman, gave a little nod and a \xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur!\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nthen quickly approached Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 and presented her forehead to\r\nbe kissed. Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 saluted her, and continued to make tea. The\r\nnew-comer was young and pretty, it seemed to Newman; she wore her\r\nbonnet and cloak, and a train of royal proportions. She began to talk\r\nrapidly in French. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, give me some tea, my beautiful one, for the\r\nlove of God! I\xe2\x80\x99m exhausted, mangled, massacred.\xe2\x80\x9d Newman found himself\r\nquite unable to follow her; she spoke much less distinctly than M.\r\nNioche.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is my sister-in-law,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Count Valentin, leaning towards\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is very pretty,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExquisite,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the young man, and this time, again, Newman\r\nsuspected him of irony.\r\n\r\nHis sister-in-law came round to the other side of the fire with her cup\r\nof tea in her hand, holding it out at arm\xe2\x80\x99s-length, so that she might\r\nnot spill it on her dress, and uttering little cries of alarm. She\r\nplaced the cup on the mantel-shelf and begun to unpin her veil and pull\r\noff her gloves, looking meanwhile at Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there anything I can do for you, my dear lady?\xe2\x80\x9d the Count Valentin\r\nasked, in a sort of mock-caressing tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPresent monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d said his sister-in-law.\r\n\r\nThe young man answered, \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Newman!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t courtesy to you, monsieur, or I shall spill my tea,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nlady. \xe2\x80\x9cSo Claire receives strangers, like that?\xe2\x80\x9d she added, in a low\r\nvoice, in French, to her brother-in-law.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cApparently!\xe2\x80\x9d he answered with a smile. Newman stood a moment, and then\r\nhe approached Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9. She looked up at him as if she were\r\nthinking of something to say. But she seemed to think of nothing; so\r\nshe simply smiled. He sat down near her and she handed him a cup of\r\ntea. For a few moments they talked about that, and meanwhile he looked\r\nat her. He remembered what Mrs. Tristram had told him of her\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cperfection\xe2\x80\x9d and of her having, in combination, all the brilliant\r\nthings that he dreamed of finding. This made him observe her not only\r\nwithout mistrust, but without uneasy conjectures; the presumption, from\r\nthe first moment he looked at her, had been in her favor. And yet, if\r\nshe was beautiful, it was not a dazzling beauty. She was tall and\r\nmoulded in long lines; she had thick fair hair, a wide forehead, and\r\nfeatures with a sort of harmonious irregularity. Her clear gray eyes\r\nwere strikingly expressive; they were both gentle and intelligent, and\r\nNewman liked them immensely; but they had not those depths of\r\nsplendor\xe2\x80\x94those many-colored rays\xe2\x80\x94which illumine the brows of famous\r\nbeauties. Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 was rather thin, and she looked younger than\r\nprobably she was. In her whole person there was something both youthful\r\nand subdued, slender and yet ample, tranquil yet shy; a mixture of\r\nimmaturity and repose, of innocence and dignity. What had Tristram\r\nmeant, Newman wondered, by calling her proud? She was certainly not\r\nproud now, to him; or if she was, it was of no use, it was lost upon\r\nhim; she must pile it up higher if she expected him to mind it. She was\r\na beautiful woman, and it was very easy to get on with her. Was she a\r\ncountess, a _marquise_, a kind of historical formation? Newman, who had\r\nrarely heard these words used, had never been at pains to attach any\r\nparticular image to them; but they occurred to him now and seemed\r\ncharged with a sort of melodious meaning. They signified something fair\r\nand softly bright, that had easy motions and spoke very agreeably.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you many friends in Paris; do you go out?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Madame de\r\nCintr\xc3\xa9, who had at last thought of something to say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean do I dance, and all that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you go _dans le monde_, as we say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have seen a good many people. Mrs. Tristram has taken me about. I do\r\nwhatever she tells me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy yourself, you are not fond of amusements?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, of some sorts. I am not fond of dancing, and that sort of\r\nthing; I am too old and sober. But I want to be amused; I came to\r\nEurope for that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you can be amused in America, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t; I was always at work. But after all, that was my\r\namusement.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this moment Madame de Bellegarde came back for another cup of tea,\r\naccompanied by the Count Valentin. Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9, when she had\r\nserved her, began to talk again with Newman, and recalling what he had\r\nlast said, \xe2\x80\x9cIn your own country you were very much occupied?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was in business. I have been in business since I was fifteen years\r\nold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what was your business?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Madame de Bellegarde, who was\r\ndecidedly not so pretty as Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been in everything,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cAt one time I sold leather;\r\nat one time I manufactured wash-tubs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame de Bellegarde made a little grimace. \xe2\x80\x9cLeather? I don\xe2\x80\x99t like\r\nthat. Wash-tubs are better. I prefer the smell of soap. I hope at least\r\nthey made your fortune.\xe2\x80\x9d She rattled this off with the air of a woman\r\nwho had the reputation of saying everything that came into her head,\r\nand with a strong French accent.\r\n\r\nNewman had spoken with cheerful seriousness, but Madame de Bellegarde\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntone made him go on, after a meditative pause, with a certain light\r\ngrimness of jocularity. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I lost money on wash-tubs, but I came out\r\npretty square on leather.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have made up my mind, after all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de Bellegarde, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\nthe great point is\xe2\x80\x94how do you call it?\xe2\x80\x94to come out square. I am on my\r\nknees to money; I don\xe2\x80\x99t deny it. If you have it, I ask no questions.\r\nFor that I am a real democrat\xe2\x80\x94like you, monsieur. Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 is\r\nvery proud; but I find that one gets much more pleasure in this sad\r\nlife if one doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look too close.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust Heaven, dear madam, how you go at it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Count Valentin,\r\nlowering his voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a man one can speak to, I suppose, since my sister receives him,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nthe lady answered. \xe2\x80\x9cBesides, it\xe2\x80\x99s very true; those are my ideas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you call them ideas,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the young man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Mrs. Tristram told me you had been in the army\xe2\x80\x94in your war,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMadame de Cintr\xc3\xa9.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but that is not business!\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery true!\xe2\x80\x9d said M. de Bellegarde. \xe2\x80\x9cOtherwise perhaps I should not be\r\npenniless.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it true,\xe2\x80\x9d asked Newman in a moment, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you are so proud? I had\r\nalready heard it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you find me so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, \xe2\x80\x9cI am no judge. If you are proud with me, you will\r\nhave to tell me. Otherwise I shall not know it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 began to laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cThat would be pride in a sad\r\nposition!\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be partly,\xe2\x80\x9d Newman went on, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to know\r\nit. I want you to treat me well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame de Cintr\xc3\xa9, whose laugh had ceased, looked at him with her head\r\nhalf averted, as if she feared what he was going to say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Tristram told you the literal truth,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on; \xe2\x80\x9cI want very\r\nmuch to know you. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t come here simply to call to-day; I came in\r\nthe hope that you might ask me to come again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, pray come often,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut will you be at home?\xe2\x80\x9d Newman insisted. Even to himself he seemed a\r\ntrifle \xe2\x80\x9cpushing,\xe2\x80\x9d but he was, in truth, a trifle excited.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope so!\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9.\r\n\r\nNewman got up. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, we shall see,\xe2\x80\x9d he said smoothing his hat with his\r\ncoat-cuff.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBrother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9, \xe2\x80\x9cinvite Mr. Newman to come again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Count Valentin looked at our hero from head to foot with his\r\npeculiar smile, in which impudence and urbanity seemed perplexingly\r\ncommingled. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you a brave man?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, eying him askance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I hope so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI rather suspect so. In that case, come again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, what an invitation!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9, with something\r\npainful in her smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I want Mr. Newman to come\xe2\x80\x94particularly,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nwill give me great pleasure. I shall be desolate if I miss one of his\r\nvisits. But I maintain he must be brave. A stout heart, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d And he\r\noffered Newman his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall not come to see you; I shall come to see Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will need all the more courage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Valentin!\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9, appealingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDecidedly,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Madame de Bellegarde, \xe2\x80\x9cI am the only person here\r\ncapable of saying something polite! Come to see me; you will need no\r\ncourage,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nNewman gave a laugh which was not altogether an assent, and took his\r\nleave. Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 did not take up her sister\xe2\x80\x99s challenge to be\r\ngracious, but she looked with a certain troubled air at the retreating\r\nguest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\nOne evening very late, about a week after his visit to Madame de\r\nCintr\xc3\xa9, Newman\xe2\x80\x99s servant brought him a card. It was that of young M. de\r\nBellegarde. When, a few moments later, he went to receive his visitor,\r\nhe found him standing in the middle of his great gilded parlor and\r\neying it from cornice to carpet. M. de Bellegarde\xe2\x80\x99s face, it seemed to\r\nNewman, expressed a sense of lively entertainment. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat the devil is\r\nhe laughing at now?\xe2\x80\x9d our hero asked himself. But he put the question\r\nwithout acrimony, for he felt that Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s brother was a\r\ngood fellow, and he had a presentiment that on this basis of good\r\nfellowship they were destined to understand each other. Only, if there\r\nwas anything to laugh at, he wished to have a glimpse of it too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo begin with,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man, as he extended his hand, \xe2\x80\x9chave I\r\ncome too late?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToo late for what?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo smoke a cigar with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou would have to come early to do that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsmoke.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you are a strong man!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I keep cigars,\xe2\x80\x9d Newman added. \xe2\x80\x9cSit down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely, I may not smoke here,\xe2\x80\x9d said M. de Bellegarde.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter? Is the room too small?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is too large. It is like smoking in a ball-room, or a church.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is what you were laughing at just now?\xe2\x80\x9d Newman asked; \xe2\x80\x9cthe size\r\nof my room?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not size only,\xe2\x80\x9d replied M. de Bellegarde, \xe2\x80\x9cbut splendor, and\r\nharmony, and beauty of detail. It was the smile of admiration.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman looked at him a moment, and then, \xe2\x80\x9cSo it _is_ very ugly?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ninquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUgly, my dear sir? It is magnificent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is the same thing, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cMake yourself\r\ncomfortable. Your coming to see me, I take it, is an act of friendship.\r\nYou were not obliged to. Therefore, if anything around here amuses you,\r\nit will be all in a pleasant way. Laugh as loud as you please; I like\r\nto see my visitors cheerful. Only, I must make this request: that you\r\nexplain the joke to me as soon as you can speak. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to lose\r\nanything, myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. de Bellegarde stared, with a look of unresentful perplexity. He laid\r\nhis hand on Newman\xe2\x80\x99s sleeve and seemed on the point of saying\r\nsomething, but he suddenly checked himself, leaned back in his chair,\r\nand puffed at his cigar. At last, however, breaking\r\nsilence,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cmy coming to see you is an act of\r\nfriendship. Nevertheless I was in a measure obliged to do so. My sister\r\nasked me to come, and a request from my sister is, for me, a law. I was\r\nnear you, and I observed lights in what I supposed were your rooms. It\r\nwas not a ceremonious hour for making a call, but I was not sorry to do\r\nsomething that would show I was not performing a mere ceremony.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, here I am as large as life,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, extending his legs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you mean,\xe2\x80\x9d the young man went on \xe2\x80\x9cby giving me\r\nunlimited leave to laugh. Certainly I am a great laugher, and it is\r\nbetter to laugh too much than too little. But it is not in order that\r\nwe may laugh together\xe2\x80\x94or separately\xe2\x80\x94that I have, I may say, sought your\r\nacquaintance. To speak with almost impudent frankness, you interest\r\nme!\xe2\x80\x9d All this was uttered by M. de Bellegarde with the modulated\r\nsmoothness of the man of the world, and in spite of his excellent\r\nEnglish, of the Frenchman; but Newman, at the same time that he sat\r\nnoting its harmonious flow, perceived that it was not mere mechanical\r\nurbanity. Decidedly, there was something in his visitor that he liked.\r\nM. de Bellegarde was a foreigner to his finger-tips, and if Newman had\r\nmet him on a Western prairie he would have felt it proper to address\r\nhim with a \xe2\x80\x9cHow-d\xe2\x80\x99ye-do, Mosseer?\xe2\x80\x9d But there was something in his\r\nphysiognomy which seemed to cast a sort of aerial bridge over the\r\nimpassable gulf produced by difference of race. He was below the middle\r\nheight, and robust and agile in figure. Valentin de Bellegarde, Newman\r\nafterwards learned, had a mortal dread of the robustness overtaking the\r\nagility; he was afraid of growing stout; he was too short, as he said,\r\nto afford a belly. He rode and fenced and practiced gymnastics with\r\nunremitting zeal, and if you greeted him with a \xe2\x80\x9cHow well you are\r\nlooking\xe2\x80\x9d he started and turned pale. In your _well_ he read a grosser\r\nmonosyllable. He had a round head, high above the ears, a crop of hair\r\nat once dense and silky, a broad, low forehead, a short nose, of the\r\nironical and inquiring rather than of the dogmatic or sensitive cast,\r\nand a moustache as delicate as that of a page in a romance. He\r\nresembled his sister not in feature, but in the expression of his\r\nclear, bright eye, completely void of introspection, and in the way he\r\nsmiled. The great point in his face was that it was intensely\r\nalive\xe2\x80\x94frankly, ardently, gallantly alive. The look of it was like a\r\nbell, of which the handle might have been in the young man\xe2\x80\x99s soul: at a\r\ntouch of the handle it rang with a loud, silver sound. There was\r\nsomething in his quick, light brown eye which assured you that he was\r\nnot economizing his consciousness. He was not living in a corner of it\r\nto spare the furniture of the rest. He was squarely encamped in the\r\ncentre and he was keeping open house. When he smiled, it was like the\r\nmovement of a person who in emptying a cup turns it upside down: he\r\ngave you the last drop of his jollity. He inspired Newman with\r\nsomething of the same kindness that our hero used to feel in his\r\nearlier years for those of his companions who could perform strange and\r\nclever tricks\xe2\x80\x94make their joints crack in queer places or whistle at the\r\nback of their mouths.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy sister told me,\xe2\x80\x9d M. de Bellegarde continued, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I ought to come\r\nand remove the impression that I had taken such great pains to produce\r\nupon you; the impression that I am a lunatic. Did it strike you that I\r\nbehaved very oddly the other day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRather so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo my sister tells me.\xe2\x80\x9d And M. de Bellegarde watched his host for a\r\nmoment through his smoke-wreaths. \xe2\x80\x9cIf that is the case, I think we had\r\nbetter let it stand. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t try to make you think I was a lunatic, at\r\nall; on the contrary, I wanted to produce a favorable impression. But\r\nif, after all, I made a fool of myself, it was the intention of\r\nProvidence. I should injure myself by protesting too much, for I should\r\nseem to set up a claim for wisdom which, in the sequel of our\r\nacquaintance, I could by no means justify. Set me down as a lunatic\r\nwith intervals of sanity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I guess you know what you are about,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I am sane, I am very sane; that I admit,\xe2\x80\x9d M. de Bellegarde\r\nanswered. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I didn\xe2\x80\x99t come here to talk about myself. I should like\r\nto ask you a few questions. You allow me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me a specimen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou live here all alone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbsolutely. With whom should I live?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the moment,\xe2\x80\x9d said M. de Bellegarde with a smile \xe2\x80\x9cI am asking\r\nquestions, not answering them. You have come to Paris for your\r\npleasure?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman was silent a while. Then, at last, \xe2\x80\x9cEveryone asks me that!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid with his mild slowness. \xe2\x80\x9cIt sounds so awfully foolish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut at any rate you had a reason.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I came for my pleasure!\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cThough it is foolish, it is\r\ntrue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you are enjoying it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLike any other good American, Newman thought it as well not to truckle\r\nto the foreigner. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, so-so,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered.\r\n\r\nM. de Bellegarde puffed his cigar again in silence. \xe2\x80\x9cFor myself,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid at last, \xe2\x80\x9cI am entirely at your service. Anything I can do for you\r\nI shall be very happy to do. Call upon me at your convenience. Is there\r\nanyone you desire to know\xe2\x80\x94anything you wish to see? It is a pity you\r\nshould not enjoy Paris.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I do enjoy it!\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, good-naturedly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m much obliged to\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHonestly speaking,\xe2\x80\x9d M. de Bellegarde went on, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is something\r\nabsurd to me in hearing myself make you these offers. They represent a\r\ngreat deal of goodwill, but they represent little else. You are a\r\nsuccessful man and I am a failure, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a turning of the tables to\r\ntalk as if I could lend you a hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn what way are you a failure?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99m not a tragical failure!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the young man with a laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nhave fallen from a height, and my fiasco has made no noise. You,\r\nevidently, are a success. You have made a fortune, you have built up an\r\nedifice, you are a financial, commercial power, you can travel about\r\nthe world until you have found a soft spot, and lie down in it with the\r\nconsciousness of having earned your rest. Is not that true? Well,\r\nimagine the exact reverse of all that, and you have me. I have done\r\nnothing\xe2\x80\x94I can do nothing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a long story. Some day I will tell you. Meanwhile, I\xe2\x80\x99m right, eh?\r\nYou are a success? You have made a fortune? It\xe2\x80\x99s none of my business,\r\nbut, in short, you are rich?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s another thing that it sounds foolish to say,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHang it, no man is rich!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have heard philosophers affirm,\xe2\x80\x9d laughed M. de Bellegarde, \xe2\x80\x9cthat no\r\nman was poor; but your formula strikes me as an improvement. As a\r\ngeneral thing, I confess, I don\xe2\x80\x99t like successful people, and I find\r\nclever men who have made great fortunes very offensive. They tread on\r\nmy toes; they make me uncomfortable. But as soon as I saw you, I said\r\nto myself. \xe2\x80\x98Ah, there is a man with whom I shall get on. He has the\r\ngood-nature of success and none of the _morgue_; he has not our\r\nconfoundedly irritable French vanity.\xe2\x80\x99 In short, I took a fancy to you.\r\nWe are very different, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure; I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe there is a subject on\r\nwhich we think or feel alike. But I rather think we shall get on, for\r\nthere is such a thing, you know, as being too different to quarrel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I never quarrel,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever! Sometimes it\xe2\x80\x99s a duty\xe2\x80\x94or at least it\xe2\x80\x99s a pleasure. Oh, I have\r\nhad two or three delicious quarrels in my day!\xe2\x80\x9d and M. de Bellegarde\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhandsome smile assumed, at the memory of these incidents, an almost\r\nvoluptuous intensity.\r\n\r\nWith the preamble embodied in his share of the foregoing fragment of\r\ndialogue, he paid our hero a long visit; as the two men sat with their\r\nheels on Newman\xe2\x80\x99s glowing hearth, they heard the small hours of the\r\nmorning striking larger from a far-off belfry. Valentin de Bellegarde\r\nwas, by his own confession, at all times a great chatterer, and on this\r\noccasion he was evidently in a particularly loquacious mood. It was a\r\ntradition of his race that people of its blood always conferred a favor\r\nby their smiles, and as his enthusiasms were as rare as his civility\r\nwas constant, he had a double reason for not suspecting that his\r\nfriendship could ever be importunate. Moreover, the flower of an\r\nancient stem as he was, tradition (since I have used the word) had in\r\nhis temperament nothing of disagreeable rigidity. It was muffled in\r\nsociability and urbanity, as an old dowager in her laces and strings of\r\npearls. Valentin was what is called in France a _gentilhomme_, of the\r\npurest source, and his rule of life, so far as it was definite, was to\r\nplay the part of a _gentilhomme_. This, it seemed to him, was enough to\r\noccupy comfortably a young man of ordinary good parts. But all that he\r\nwas he was by instinct and not by theory, and the amiability of his\r\ncharacter was so great that certain of the aristocratic virtues, which\r\nin some aspects seem rather brittle and trenchant, acquired in his\r\napplication of them an extreme geniality. In his younger years he had\r\nbeen suspected of low tastes, and his mother had greatly feared he\r\nwould make a slip in the mud of the highway and bespatter the family\r\nshield. He had been treated, therefore, to more than his share of\r\nschooling and drilling, but his instructors had not succeeded in\r\nmounting him upon stilts. They could not spoil his safe spontaneity,\r\nand he remained the least cautious and the most lucky of young nobles.\r\nHe had been tied with so short a rope in his youth that he had now a\r\nmortal grudge against family discipline. He had been known to say,\r\nwithin the limits of the family, that, light-headed as he was, the\r\nhonor of the name was safer in his hands than in those of some of its\r\nother members, and that if a day ever came to try it, they should see.\r\nHis talk was an odd mixture of almost boyish garrulity and of the\r\nreserve and discretion of the man of the world, and he seemed to\r\nNewman, as afterwards young members of the Latin races often seemed to\r\nhim, now amusingly juvenile and now appallingly mature. In America,\r\nNewman reflected, lads of twenty-five and thirty have old heads and\r\nyoung hearts, or at least young morals; here they have young heads and\r\nvery aged hearts, morals the most grizzled and wrinkled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I envy you is your liberty,\xe2\x80\x9d observed M. de Bellegarde, \xe2\x80\x9cyour\r\nwide range, your freedom to come and go, your not having a lot of\r\npeople, who take themselves awfully seriously, expecting something of\r\nyou. I live,\xe2\x80\x9d he added with a sigh, \xe2\x80\x9cbeneath the eyes of my admirable\r\nmother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is your own fault; what is to hinder your ranging?\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a delightful simplicity in that remark! Everything is to\r\nhinder me. To begin with, I have not a penny.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had not a penny when I began to range.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, but your poverty was your capital. Being an American, it was\r\nimpossible you should remain what you were born, and being born poor\xe2\x80\x94do\r\nI understand it?\xe2\x80\x94it was therefore inevitable that you should become\r\nrich. You were in a position that makes one\xe2\x80\x99s mouth water; you looked\r\nround you and saw a world full of things you had only to step up to and\r\ntake hold of. When I was twenty, I looked around me and saw a world\r\nwith everything ticketed \xe2\x80\x98Hands off!\xe2\x80\x99 and the deuce of it was that the\r\nticket seemed meant only for me. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t go into business, I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t make money, because I was a Bellegarde. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t go into\r\npolitics, because I was a Bellegarde\xe2\x80\x94the Bellegardes don\xe2\x80\x99t recognize\r\nthe Bonapartes. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t go into literature, because I was a dunce. I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t marry a rich girl, because no Bellegarde had ever married a\r\n_roturi\xc3\xa8re_, and it was not proper that I should begin. We shall have\r\nto come to it, yet. Marriageable heiresses, _de notre bord_, are not to\r\nbe had for nothing; it must be name for name, and fortune for fortune.\r\nThe only thing I could do was to go and fight for the Pope. That I did,\r\npunctiliously, and received an apostolic flesh-wound at Castlefidardo.\r\nIt did neither the Holy Father nor me any good, that I could see. Rome\r\nwas doubtless a very amusing place in the days of Caligula, but it has\r\nsadly fallen off since. I passed three years in the Castle of St.\r\nAngelo, and then came back to secular life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you have no profession\xe2\x80\x94you do nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do nothing! I am supposed to amuse myself, and, to tell the truth, I\r\nhave amused myself. One can, if one knows how. But you can\xe2\x80\x99t keep it up\r\nforever. I am good for another five years, perhaps, but I foresee that\r\nafter that I shall lose my appetite. Then what shall I do? I think I\r\nshall turn monk. Seriously, I think I shall tie a rope round my waist\r\nand go into a monastery. It was an old custom, and the old customs were\r\nvery good. People understood life quite as well as we do. They kept the\r\npot boiling till it cracked, and then they put it on the shelf\r\naltogether.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you very religious?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Newman, in a tone which gave the\r\ninquiry a grotesque effect.\r\n\r\nM. de Bellegarde evidently appreciated the comical element in the\r\nquestion, but he looked at Newman a moment with extreme soberness. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nam a very good Catholic. I respect the Church. I adore the blessed\r\nVirgin. I fear the Devil.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are very well fixed. You have got\r\npleasure in the present and religion in the future; what do you\r\ncomplain of?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a part of one\xe2\x80\x99s pleasure to complain. There is something in your\r\nown circumstances that irritates me. You are the first man I have ever\r\nenvied. It\xe2\x80\x99s singular, but so it is. I have known many men who, besides\r\nany factitious advantages that I may possess, had money and brains into\r\nthe bargain; but somehow they have never disturbed my good-humor. But\r\nyou have got something that I should have liked to have. It is not\r\nmoney, it is not even brains\xe2\x80\x94though no doubt yours are excellent. It is\r\nnot your six feet of height, though I should have rather liked to be a\r\ncouple of inches taller. It\xe2\x80\x99s a sort of air you have of being\r\nthoroughly at home in the world. When I was a boy, my father told me\r\nthat it was by such an air as that that people recognized a Bellegarde.\r\nHe called my attention to it. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t advise me to cultivate it; he\r\nsaid that as we grew up it always came of itself. I supposed it had\r\ncome to me, because I think I have always had the feeling. My place in\r\nlife was made for me, and it seemed easy to occupy it. But you who, as\r\nI understand it, have made your own place, you who, as you told us the\r\nother day, have manufactured wash-tubs\xe2\x80\x94you strike me, somehow, as a man\r\nwho stands at his ease, who looks at things from a height. I fancy you\r\ngoing about the world like a man traveling on a railroad in which he\r\nowns a large amount of stock. You make me feel as if I had missed\r\nsomething. What is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the proud consciousness of honest toil\xe2\x80\x94of having manufactured a\r\nfew wash-tubs,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, at once jocose and serious.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no; I have seen men who had done even more, men who had made not\r\nonly wash-tubs, but soap\xe2\x80\x94strong-smelling yellow soap, in great bars;\r\nand they never made me the least uncomfortable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen it\xe2\x80\x99s the privilege of being an American citizen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat sets a man up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPossibly,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined M. de Bellegarde. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I am forced to say that I\r\nhave seen a great many American citizens who didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem at all set up\r\nor in the least like large stock-holders. I never envied them. I rather\r\nthink the thing is an accomplishment of your own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, come,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will make me proud!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I shall not. You have nothing to do with pride, or with\r\nhumility\xe2\x80\x94that is a part of this easy manner of yours. People are proud\r\nonly when they have something to lose, and humble when they have\r\nsomething to gain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I have to lose,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I certainly have\r\nsomething to gain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked his visitor.\r\n\r\nNewman hesitated a while. \xe2\x80\x9cI will tell you when I know you better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope that will be soon! Then, if I can help you to gain it, I shall\r\nbe happy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you may,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t forget, then, that I am your servant,\xe2\x80\x9d M. de Bellegarde\r\nanswered; and shortly afterwards he took his departure.\r\n\r\nDuring the next three weeks Newman saw Bellegarde several times, and\r\nwithout formally swearing an eternal friendship the two men established\r\na sort of comradeship. To Newman, Bellegarde was the ideal Frenchman,\r\nthe Frenchman of tradition and romance, so far as our hero was\r\nconcerned with these mystical influences. Gallant, expansive, amusing,\r\nmore pleased himself with the effect he produced than those (even when\r\nthey were well pleased) for whom he produced it; a master of all the\r\ndistinctively social virtues and a votary of all agreeable sensations;\r\na devotee of something mysterious and sacred to which he occasionally\r\nalluded in terms more ecstatic even than those in which he spoke of the\r\nlast pretty woman, and which was simply the beautiful though somewhat\r\nsuperannuated image of _honor_; he was irresistibly entertaining and\r\nenlivening, and he formed a character to which Newman was as capable of\r\ndoing justice when he had once been placed in contact with it, as he\r\nwas unlikely, in musing upon the possible mixtures of our human\r\ningredients, mentally to have foreshadowed it. Bellegarde did not in\r\nthe least cause him to modify his needful premise that all Frenchmen\r\nare of a frothy and imponderable substance; he simply reminded him that\r\nlight materials may be beaten up into a most agreeable compound. No two\r\ncompanions could be more different, but their differences made a\r\ncapital basis for a friendship of which the distinctive characteristic\r\nwas that it was extremely amusing to each.\r\n\r\nValentin de Bellegarde lived in the basement of an old house in the Rue\r\nd\xe2\x80\x99Anjou St. Honor\xc3\xa9, and his small apartments lay between the court of\r\nthe house and an old garden which spread itself behind it\xe2\x80\x94one of those\r\nlarge, sunless humid gardens into which you look unexpectingly in Paris\r\nfrom back windows, wondering how among the grudging habitations they\r\nfind their space. When Newman returned Bellegarde\xe2\x80\x99s visit, he hinted\r\nthat _his_ lodging was at least as much a laughing matter as his own.\r\nBut its oddities were of a different cast from those of our hero\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngilded saloons on the Boulevard Haussmann: the place was low, dusky,\r\ncontracted, and crowded with curious bric-\xc3\xa0-brac. Bellegarde, penniless\r\npatrician as he was, was an insatiable collector, and his walls were\r\ncovered with rusty arms and ancient panels and platters, his doorways\r\ndraped in faded tapestries, his floors muffled in the skins of beasts.\r\nHere and there was one of those uncomfortable tributes to elegance in\r\nwhich the upholsterer\xe2\x80\x99s art, in France, is so prolific; a curtain\r\nrecess with a sheet of looking-glass in which, among the shadows, you\r\ncould see nothing; a divan on which, for its festoons and furbelows,\r\nyou could not sit; a fireplace draped, flounced, and frilled to the\r\ncomplete exclusion of fire. The young man\xe2\x80\x99s possessions were in\r\npicturesque disorder, and his apartment was pervaded by the odor of\r\ncigars, mingled with perfumes more inscrutable. Newman thought it a\r\ndamp, gloomy place to live in, and was puzzled by the obstructive and\r\nfragmentary character of the furniture.\r\n\r\nBellegarde, according to the custom of his country talked very\r\ngenerously about himself, and unveiled the mysteries of his private\r\nhistory with an unsparing hand. Inevitably, he had a vast deal to say\r\nabout women, and he used frequently to indulge in sentimental and\r\nironical apostrophes to these authors of his joys and woes. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, the\r\nwomen, the women, and the things they have made me do!\xe2\x80\x9d he would\r\nexclaim with a lustrous eye. \xe2\x80\x9c_C\xe2\x80\x99est \xc3\xa9gal_, of all the follies and\r\nstupidities I have committed for them I would not have missed one!\xe2\x80\x9d On\r\nthis subject Newman maintained an habitual reserve; to expatiate\r\nlargely upon it had always seemed to him a proceeding vaguely analogous\r\nto the cooing of pigeons and the chattering of monkeys, and even\r\ninconsistent with a fully developed human character. But Bellegarde\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconfidences greatly amused him, and rarely displeased him, for the\r\ngenerous young Frenchman was not a cynic. \xe2\x80\x9cI really think,\xe2\x80\x9d he had once\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I am not more depraved than most of my contemporaries. They\r\nare tolerably depraved, my contemporaries!\xe2\x80\x9d He said wonderfully pretty\r\nthings about his female friends, and, numerous and various as they had\r\nbeen, declared that on the whole there was more good in them than harm.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you are not to take that as advice,\xe2\x80\x9d he added. \xe2\x80\x9cAs an authority I\r\nam very untrustworthy. I\xe2\x80\x99m prejudiced in their favor; I\xe2\x80\x99m an\r\n_idealist!_\xe2\x80\x9d Newman listened to him with his impartial smile, and was\r\nglad, for his own sake, that he had fine feelings; but he mentally\r\nrepudiated the idea of a Frenchman having discovered any merit in the\r\namiable sex which he himself did not suspect. M. de Bellegarde,\r\nhowever, did not confine his conversation to the autobiographical\r\nchannel; he questioned our hero largely as to the events of his own\r\nlife, and Newman told him some better stories than any that Bellegarde\r\ncarried in his budget. He narrated his career, in fact, from the\r\nbeginning, through all its variations, and whenever his companion\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncredulity, or his habits of gentility, appeared to protest, it amused\r\nhim to heighten the color of the episode. Newman had sat with Western\r\nhumorists in knots, round cast-iron stoves, and seen \xe2\x80\x9ctall\xe2\x80\x9d stories\r\ngrow taller without toppling over, and his own imagination had learned\r\nthe trick of piling up consistent wonders. Bellegarde\xe2\x80\x99s regular\r\nattitude at last became that of laughing self-defense; to maintain his\r\nreputation as an all-knowing Frenchman, he doubted of everything,\r\nwholesale. The result of this was that Newman found it impossible to\r\nconvince him of certain time-honored verities.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the details don\xe2\x80\x99t matter,\xe2\x80\x9d said M. de Bellegarde. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have\r\nevidently had some surprising adventures; you have seen some strange\r\nsides of life, you have revolved to and fro over a whole continent as I\r\nwalked up and down the Boulevard. You are a man of the world with a\r\nvengeance! You have spent some deadly dull hours, and you have done\r\nsome extremely disagreeable things: you have shoveled sand, as a boy,\r\nfor supper, and you have eaten roast dog in a gold-diggers\xe2\x80\x99 camp. You\r\nhave stood casting up figures for ten hours at a time, and you have sat\r\nthrough Methodist sermons for the sake of looking at a pretty girl in\r\nanother pew. All that is rather stiff, as we say. But at any rate you\r\nhave done something and you are something; you have used your will and\r\nyou have made your fortune. You have not stupified yourself with\r\ndebauchery and you have not mortgaged your fortune to social\r\nconveniences. You take things easily, and you have fewer prejudices\r\neven than I, who pretend to have none, but who in reality have three or\r\nfour. Happy man, you are strong and you are free. But what the deuce,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ndemanded the young man in conclusion, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you propose to do with such\r\nadvantages? Really to use them you need a better world than this. There\r\nis nothing worth your while here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I think there is something,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Newman, \xe2\x80\x9cI will tell you some other time!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn this way our hero delayed from day to day broaching a subject which\r\nhe had very much at heart. Meanwhile, however, he was growing\r\npractically familiar with it; in other words, he had called again,\r\nthree times, on Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9. On only two of these occasions had he\r\nfound her at home, and on each of them she had other visitors. Her\r\nvisitors were numerous and extremely loquacious, and they exacted much\r\nof their hostess\xe2\x80\x99s attention. She found time, however, to bestow a\r\nlittle of it on Newman, in an occasional vague smile, the very\r\nvagueness of which pleased him, allowing him as it did to fill it out\r\nmentally, both at the time and afterwards, with such meanings as most\r\npleased him. He sat by without speaking, looking at the entrances and\r\nexits, the greetings and chatterings, of Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s visitors.\r\nHe felt as if he were at the play, and as if his own speaking would be\r\nan interruption; sometimes he wished he had a book, to follow the\r\ndialogue; he half expected to see a woman in a white cap and pink\r\nribbons come and offer him one for two francs. Some of the ladies\r\nlooked at him very hard\xe2\x80\x94or very soft, as you please; others seemed\r\nprofoundly unconscious of his presence. The men looked only at Madame\r\nde Cintr\xc3\xa9. This was inevitable; for whether one called her beautiful or\r\nnot, she entirely occupied and filled one\xe2\x80\x99s vision, just as an\r\nagreeable sound fills one\xe2\x80\x99s ear. Newman had but twenty distinct words\r\nwith her, but he carried away an impression to which solemn promises\r\ncould not have given a higher value. She was part of the play that he\r\nwas seeing acted, quite as much as her companions; but how she filled\r\nthe stage and how much better she did it! Whether she rose or seated\r\nherself; whether she went with her departing friends to the door and\r\nlifted up the heavy curtain as they passed out, and stood an instant\r\nlooking after them and giving them the last nod; or whether she leaned\r\nback in her chair with her arms crossed and her eyes resting, listening\r\nand smiling; she gave Newman the feeling that he should like to have\r\nher always before him, moving slowly to and fro along the whole scale\r\nof expressive hospitality. If it might be _to_ him, it would be well;\r\nif it might be _for_ him, it would be still better! She was so tall and\r\nyet so light, so active and yet so still, so elegant and yet so simple,\r\nso frank and yet so mysterious! It was the mystery\xe2\x80\x94it was what she was\r\noff the stage, as it were\xe2\x80\x94that interested Newman most of all. He could\r\nnot have told you what warrant he had for talking about mysteries; if\r\nit had been his habit to express himself in poetic figures he might\r\nhave said that in observing Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 he seemed to see the vague\r\ncircle which sometimes accompanies the partly-filled disk of the moon.\r\nIt was not that she was reserved; on the contrary, she was as frank as\r\nflowing water. But he was sure she had qualities which she herself did\r\nnot suspect.\r\n\r\nHe had abstained for several reasons from saying some of these things\r\nto Bellegarde. One reason was that before proceeding to any act he was\r\nalways circumspect, conjectural, contemplative; he had little\r\neagerness, as became a man who felt that whenever he really began to\r\nmove he walked with long steps. And then, it simply pleased him not to\r\nspeak\xe2\x80\x94it occupied him, it excited him. But one day Bellegarde had been\r\ndining with him, at a restaurant, and they had sat long over their\r\ndinner. On rising from it, Bellegarde proposed that, to help them\r\nthrough the rest of the evening, they should go and see Madame\r\nDandelard. Madame Dandelard was a little Italian lady who had married a\r\nFrenchman who proved to be a rake and a brute and the torment of her\r\nlife. Her husband had spent all her money, and then, lacking the means\r\nof obtaining more expensive pleasures, had taken, in his duller hours,\r\nto beating her. She had a blue spot somewhere, which she showed to\r\nseveral persons, including Bellegarde. She had obtained a separation\r\nfrom her husband, collected the scraps of her fortune (they were very\r\nmeagre) and come to live in Paris, where she was staying at a _h\xc3\xb4tel\r\ngarni_. She was always looking for an apartment, and visiting,\r\ninquiringly, those of other people. She was very pretty, very\r\nchildlike, and she made very extraordinary remarks. Bellegarde had made\r\nher acquaintance, and the source of his interest in her was, according\r\nto his own declaration, a curiosity as to what would become of her.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is poor, she is pretty, and she is silly,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cit seems to\r\nme she can go only one way. It\xe2\x80\x99s a pity, but it can\xe2\x80\x99t be helped. I will\r\ngive her six months. She has nothing to fear from me, but I am watching\r\nthe process. I am curious to see just how things will go. Yes, I know\r\nwhat you are going to say: this horrible Paris hardens one\xe2\x80\x99s heart. But\r\nit quickens one\xe2\x80\x99s wits, and it ends by teaching one a refinement of\r\nobservation! To see this little woman\xe2\x80\x99s little drama play itself out,\r\nnow, is, for me, an intellectual pleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf she is going to throw herself away,\xe2\x80\x9d Newman had said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou ought to\r\nstop her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop her? How stop her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTalk to her; give her some good advice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBellegarde laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cHeaven deliver us both! Imagine the situation! Go\r\nand advise her yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was after this that Newman had gone with Bellegarde to see Madame\r\nDandelard. When they came away, Bellegarde reproached his companion.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere was your famous advice?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear a word of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I give it up,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, simply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you are as bad as I!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bellegarde.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, because I don\xe2\x80\x99t take an \xe2\x80\x98intellectual pleasure\xe2\x80\x99 in her prospective\r\nadventures. I don\xe2\x80\x99t in the least want to see her going down hill. I had\r\nrather look the other way. But why,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, in a moment, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nget your sister to go and see her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBellegarde stared. \xe2\x80\x9cGo and see Madame Dandelard\xe2\x80\x94my sister?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe might talk to her to very good purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBellegarde shook his head with sudden gravity. \xe2\x80\x9cMy sister can\xe2\x80\x99t see\r\nthat sort of person. Madame Dandelard is nothing at all; they would\r\nnever meet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, \xe2\x80\x9cthat your sister might see whom she\r\npleased.\xe2\x80\x9d And he privately resolved that after he knew her a little\r\nbetter he would ask Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 to go and talk to the foolish\r\nlittle Italian lady.\r\n\r\nAfter his dinner with Bellegarde, on the occasion I have mentioned, he\r\ndemurred to his companion\xe2\x80\x99s proposal that they should go again and\r\nlisten to Madame Dandelard describe her sorrows and her bruises.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have something better in mind,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9ccome home with me and\r\nfinish the evening before my fire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBellegarde always welcomed the prospect of a long stretch of\r\nconversation, and before long the two men sat watching the great blaze\r\nwhich scattered its scintillations over the high adornments of Newman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nball-room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me something about your sister,\xe2\x80\x9d Newman began abruptly.\r\n\r\nBellegarde turned and gave him a quick look. \xe2\x80\x9cNow that I think of it,\r\nyou have never yet asked me a question about her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know that very well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it is because you don\xe2\x80\x99t trust me, you are very right,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nBellegarde. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t talk of her rationally. I admire her too much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTalk of her as you can,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cLet yourself go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we are very good friends; we are such a brother and sister as\r\nhave not been seen since Orestes and Electra. You have seen her; you\r\nknow what she is: tall, thin, light, imposing, and gentle, half a\r\n_grande dame_ and half an angel; a mixture of pride and humility, of\r\nthe eagle and the dove. She looks like a statue which had failed as\r\nstone, resigned itself to its grave defects, and come to life as flesh\r\nand blood, to wear white capes and long trains. All I can say is that\r\nshe really possesses every merit that her face, her glance, her smile,\r\nthe tone of her voice, lead you to expect; it is saying a great deal.\r\nAs a general thing, when a woman seems very charming, I should say\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Beware!\xe2\x80\x99 But in proportion as Claire seems charming you may fold your\r\narms and let yourself float with the current; you are safe. She is so\r\ngood! I have never seen a woman half so perfect or so complete. She has\r\neverything; that is all I can say about her. There!\xe2\x80\x9d Bellegarde\r\nconcluded; \xe2\x80\x9cI told you I should rhapsodize.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman was silent a while, as if he were turning over his companion\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwords. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is very good, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDivinely good!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKind, charitable, gentle, generous?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGenerosity itself; kindness double-distilled!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs she clever?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is the most intelligent woman I know. Try her, some day, with\r\nsomething difficult, and you will see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs she fond of admiration?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Parbleu!_\xe2\x80\x9d cried Bellegarde; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat woman is not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, when they are too fond of admiration they commit all kinds of\r\nfollies to get it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not say she was too fond!\xe2\x80\x9d Bellegarde exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cHeaven forbid\r\nI should say anything so idiotic. She is not _too_ anything! If I were\r\nto say she was ugly, I should not mean she was too ugly. She is fond of\r\npleasing, and if you are pleased she is grateful. If you are not\r\npleased, she lets it pass and thinks the worst neither of you nor of\r\nherself. I imagine, though, she hopes the saints in heaven are, for I\r\nam sure she is incapable of trying to please by any means of which they\r\nwould disapprove.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs she grave or gay?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is both; not alternately, for she is always the same. There is\r\ngravity in her gaiety, and gaiety in her gravity. But there is no\r\nreason why she should be particularly gay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs she unhappy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t say that, for unhappiness is according as one takes things,\r\nand Claire takes them according to some receipt communicated to her by\r\nthe Blessed Virgin in a vision. To be unhappy is to be disagreeable,\r\nwhich, for her, is out of the question. So she has arranged her\r\ncircumstances so as to be happy in them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is a philosopher,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, she is simply a very nice woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer circumstances, at any rate, have been disagreeable?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBellegarde hesitated a moment\xe2\x80\x94a thing he very rarely did. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, my dear\r\nfellow, if I go into the history of my family I shall give you more\r\nthan you bargain for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, on the contrary, I bargain for that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall have to appoint a special s\xc3\xa9ance, then, beginning early.\r\nSuffice it for the present that Claire has not slept on roses. She made\r\nat eighteen a marriage that was expected to be brilliant, but that\r\nturned out like a lamp that goes out; all smoke and bad smell. M. de\r\nCintr\xc3\xa9 was sixty years old, and an odious old gentleman. He lived,\r\nhowever, but a short time, and after his death his family pounced upon\r\nhis money, brought a lawsuit against his widow, and pushed things very\r\nhard. Their case was a good one, for M. de Cintr\xc3\xa9, who had been trustee\r\nfor some of his relatives, appeared to have been guilty of some very\r\nirregular practices. In the course of the suit some revelations were\r\nmade as to his private history which my sister found so displeasing\r\nthat she ceased to defend herself and washed her hands of the property.\r\nThis required some pluck, for she was between two fires, her husband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfamily opposing her and her own family forcing her. My mother and my\r\nbrother wished her to cleave to what they regarded as her rights. But\r\nshe resisted firmly, and at last bought her freedom\xe2\x80\x94obtained my\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s assent to dropping the suit at the price of a promise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was the promise?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo do anything else, for the next ten years, that was asked of\r\nher\xe2\x80\x94anything, that is, but marry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe had disliked her husband very much?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo one knows how much!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe marriage had been made in your horrible French way,\xe2\x80\x9d Newman\r\ncontinued, \xe2\x80\x9cmade by the two families, without her having any voice?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a chapter for a novel. She saw M. de Cintr\xc3\xa9 for the first time\r\na month before the wedding, after everything, to the minutest detail,\r\nhad been arranged. She turned white when she looked at him, and white\r\nshe remained till her wedding-day. The evening before the ceremony she\r\nswooned away, and she spent the whole night in sobs. My mother sat\r\nholding her two hands, and my brother walked up and down the room. I\r\ndeclared it was revolting and told my sister publicly that if she would\r\nrefuse, downright, I would stand by her. I was told to go about my\r\nbusiness, and she became Comtesse de Cintr\xc3\xa9.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour brother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, reflectively, \xe2\x80\x9cmust be a very nice young\r\nman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is very nice, though he is not young. He is upward of fifty,\r\nfifteen years my senior. He has been a father to my sister and me. He\r\nis a very remarkable man; he has the best manners in France. He is\r\nextremely clever; indeed he is very learned. He is writing a history of\r\nThe Princesses of France Who Never Married.\xe2\x80\x9d This was said by\r\nBellegarde with extreme gravity, looking straight at Newman, and with\r\nan eye that betokened no mental reservation; or that, at least, almost\r\nbetokened none.\r\n\r\nNewman perhaps discovered there what little there was, for he presently\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t love your brother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bellegarde, ceremoniously; \xe2\x80\x9cwell-bred people\r\nalways love their brothers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I don\xe2\x80\x99t love him, then!\xe2\x80\x9d Newman answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait till you know him!\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Bellegarde, and this time he smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs your mother also very remarkable?\xe2\x80\x9d Newman asked, after a pause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor my mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bellegarde, now with intense gravity, \xe2\x80\x9cI have the\r\nhighest admiration. She is a very extraordinary woman. You cannot\r\napproach her without perceiving it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is the daughter, I believe, of an English nobleman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf the Earl of St. Dunstan\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs the Earl of St. Dunstan\xe2\x80\x99s a very old family?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo-so; the sixteenth century. It is on my father\xe2\x80\x99s side that we go\r\nback\xe2\x80\x94back, back, back. The family antiquaries themselves lose breath.\r\nAt last they stop, panting and fanning themselves, somewhere in the\r\nninth century, under Charlemagne. That is where we begin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no mistake about it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure I hope not. We have been mistaken at least for several\r\ncenturies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you have always married into old families?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs a rule; though in so long a stretch of time there have been some\r\nexceptions. Three or four Bellegardes, in the seventeenth and\r\neighteenth centuries, took wives out of the _bourgeoisie_\xe2\x80\x94married\r\nlawyers\xe2\x80\x99 daughters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s daughter; that\xe2\x80\x99s very bad, is it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHorrible! one of us, in the Middle Ages, did better: he married a\r\nbeggar-maid, like King Cophetua. That was really better; it was like\r\nmarrying a bird or a monkey; one didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to think about her family\r\nat all. Our women have always done well; they have never even gone into\r\nthe _petite noblesse_. There is, I believe, not a case on record of a\r\nmisalliance among the women.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman turned this over for a while, and, then at last he said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\noffered, the first time you came to see me to render me any service you\r\ncould. I told you that some time I would mention something you might\r\ndo. Do you remember?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemember? I have been counting the hours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well; here\xe2\x80\x99s your chance. Do what you can to make your sister\r\nthink well of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBellegarde stared, with a smile. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure she thinks as well of\r\nyou as possible, already.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn opinion founded on seeing me three or four times? That is putting\r\nme off with very little. I want something more. I have been thinking of\r\nit a good deal, and at last I have decided to tell you. I should like\r\nvery much to marry Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBellegarde had been looking at him with quickened expectancy, and with\r\nthe smile with which he had greeted Newman\xe2\x80\x99s allusion to his promised\r\nrequest. At this last announcement he continued to gaze; but his smile\r\nwent through two or three curious phases. It felt, apparently, a\r\nmomentary impulse to broaden; but this it immediately checked. Then it\r\nremained for some instants taking counsel with itself, at the end of\r\nwhich it decreed a retreat. It slowly effaced itself and left a look of\r\nseriousness modified by the desire not to be rude. Extreme surprise had\r\ncome into the Count Valentin\xe2\x80\x99s face; but he had reflected that it would\r\nbe uncivil to leave it there. And yet, what the deuce was he to do with\r\nit? He got up, in his agitation, and stood before the chimney-piece,\r\nstill looking at Newman. He was a longer time thinking what to say than\r\none would have expected.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you can\xe2\x80\x99t render me the service I ask,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, \xe2\x80\x9csay it out!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me hear it again, distinctly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bellegarde. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very\r\nimportant, you know. I shall plead your cause with my sister, because\r\nyou want\xe2\x80\x94you want to marry her? That\xe2\x80\x99s it, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t say plead my cause, exactly; I shall try and do that\r\nmyself. But say a good word for me, now and then\xe2\x80\x94let her know that you\r\nthink well of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this, Bellegarde gave a little light laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I want chiefly, after all,\xe2\x80\x9d Newman went on, \xe2\x80\x9cis just to let you\r\nknow what I have in mind. I suppose that is what you expect, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\r\nI want to do what is customary over here. If there is anything\r\nparticular to be done, let me know and I will do it. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t for the\r\nworld approach Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 without all the proper forms. If I\r\nought to go and tell your mother, why I will go and tell her. I will go\r\nand tell your brother, even. I will go and tell anyone you please. As I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know anyone else, I begin by telling you. But that, if it is a\r\nsocial obligation, is a pleasure as well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I see\xe2\x80\x94I see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bellegarde, lightly stroking his chin. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nhave a very right feeling about it, but I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you have begun with\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d He paused, hesitated, and then turned away and walked slowly the\r\nlength of the room. Newman got up and stood leaning against the\r\nmantel-shelf, with his hands in his pockets, watching Bellegarde\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npromenade. The young Frenchman came back and stopped in front of him.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI give it up,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cI will not pretend I am not surprised. I\r\nam\xe2\x80\x94hugely! _Ouf!_ It\xe2\x80\x99s a relief.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat sort of news is always a surprise,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cNo matter what\r\nyou have done, people are never prepared. But if you are so surprised,\r\nI hope at least you are pleased.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bellegarde. \xe2\x80\x9cI am going to be tremendously frank. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow whether I am pleased or horrified.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you are pleased, I shall be glad,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, \xe2\x80\x9cand I shall\r\nbe\xe2\x80\x94encouraged. If you are horrified, I shall be sorry, but I shall not\r\nbe discouraged. You must make the best of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is quite right\xe2\x80\x94that is your only possible attitude. You are\r\nperfectly serious?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I a Frenchman, that I should not be?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cBut why is it,\r\nby the bye, that you should be horrified?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBellegarde raised his hand to the back of his head and rubbed his hair\r\nquickly up and down, thrusting out the tip of his tongue as he did so.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you are not noble, for instance,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil I am not!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bellegarde a little more seriously, \xe2\x80\x9cI did not know you had\r\na title.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA title? What do you mean by a title?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cA count, a duke,\r\na marquis? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know anything about that, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know who is and\r\nwho is not. But I say I am noble. I don\xe2\x80\x99t exactly know what you mean by\r\nit, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a fine word and a fine idea; I put in a claim to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what have you to show, my dear fellow, what proofs?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnything you please! But you don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose I am going to undertake to\r\nprove that I am noble. It is for you to prove the contrary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s easily done. You have manufactured wash-tubs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman stared a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cTherefore I am not noble? I don\xe2\x80\x99t see it. Tell\r\nme something I have _not_ done\xe2\x80\x94something I cannot do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou cannot marry a woman like Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 for the asking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe you mean,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman slowly, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I am not good enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBrutally speaking\xe2\x80\x94yes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBellegarde had hesitated a moment, and while he hesitated Newman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nattentive glance had grown somewhat eager. In answer to these last\r\nwords he for a moment said nothing. He simply blushed a little. Then he\r\nraised his eyes to the ceiling and stood looking at one of the rosy\r\ncherubs that was painted upon it. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course I don\xe2\x80\x99t expect to marry\r\nany woman for the asking,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last; \xe2\x80\x9cI expect first to make\r\nmyself acceptable to her. She must like me, to begin with. But that I\r\nam not good enough to make a trial is rather a surprise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBellegarde wore a look of mingled perplexity, sympathy, and amusement.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou should not hesitate, then, to go up to-morrow and ask a duchess to\r\nmarry you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot if I thought she would suit me. But I am very fastidious; she\r\nmight not at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBellegarde\xe2\x80\x99s amusement began to prevail. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you should be surprised\r\nif she refused you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman hesitated a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cIt sounds conceited to say yes, but\r\nnevertheless I think I should. For I should make a very handsome\r\noffer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat would it be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything she wishes. If I get hold of a woman that comes up to my\r\nstandard, I shall think nothing too good for her. I have been a long\r\ntime looking, and I find such women are rare. To combine the qualities\r\nI require seems to be difficult, but when the difficulty is vanquished\r\nit deserves a reward. My wife shall have a good position, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not\r\nafraid to say that I shall be a good husband.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd these qualities that you require\xe2\x80\x94what are they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoodness, beauty, intelligence, a fine education, personal\r\nelegance\xe2\x80\x94everything, in a word, that makes a splendid woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd noble birth, evidently,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bellegarde.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, throw that in, by all means, if it\xe2\x80\x99s there. The more the better!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd my sister seems to you to have all these things?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is exactly what I have been looking for. She is my dream\r\nrealized.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you would make her a very good husband?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is what I wanted you to tell her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBellegarde laid his hand on his companion\xe2\x80\x99s arm a moment, looked at him\r\nwith his head on one side, from head to foot, and then, with a loud\r\nlaugh, and shaking the other hand in the air, turned away. He walked\r\nagain the length of the room, and again he came back and stationed\r\nhimself in front of Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cAll this is very interesting\xe2\x80\x94it is very\r\ncurious. In what I said just now I was speaking, not for myself, but\r\nfor my tradition, my superstitions. For myself, really, your proposal\r\ntickles me. It startled me at first, but the more I think of it the\r\nmore I see in it. It\xe2\x80\x99s no use attempting to explain anything; you won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nunderstand me. After all, I don\xe2\x80\x99t see why you need; it\xe2\x80\x99s no great\r\nloss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, if there is anything more to explain, try it! I want to proceed\r\nwith my eyes open. I will do my best to understand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bellegarde, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s disagreeable to me; I give it up. I liked\r\nyou the first time I saw you, and I will abide by that. It would be\r\nquite odious for me to come talking to you as if I could patronize you.\r\nI have told you before that I envy you; _vous m\xe2\x80\x99imposez_, as we say. I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t know you much until within five minutes. So we will let things\r\ngo, and I will say nothing to you that, if our positions were reversed,\r\nyou would not say to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI do not know whether in renouncing the mysterious opportunity to which\r\nhe alluded, Bellegarde felt that he was doing something very generous.\r\nIf so, he was not rewarded; his generosity was not appreciated. Newman\r\nquite failed to recognize the young Frenchman\xe2\x80\x99s power to wound his\r\nfeelings, and he had now no sense of escaping or coming off easily. He\r\ndid not thank his companion even with a glance. \xe2\x80\x9cMy eyes are open,\r\nthough,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cso far as that you have practically told me that\r\nyour family and your friends will turn up their noses at me. I have\r\nnever thought much about the reasons that make it proper for people to\r\nturn up their noses, and so I can only decide the question off-hand.\r\nLooking at it in that way I can\xe2\x80\x99t see anything in it. I simply think,\r\nif you want to know, that I\xe2\x80\x99m as good as the best. Who the best are, I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t pretend to say. I have never thought much about that either. To\r\ntell the truth, I have always had rather a good opinion of myself; a\r\nman who is successful can\xe2\x80\x99t help it. But I will admit that I was\r\nconceited. What I don\xe2\x80\x99t say yes to is that I don\xe2\x80\x99t stand high\xe2\x80\x94as high\r\nas anyone else. This is a line of speculation I should not have chosen,\r\nbut you must remember you began it yourself. I should never have\r\ndreamed that I was on the defensive, or that I had to justify myself;\r\nbut if your people will have it so, I will do my best.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you offered, a while ago, to make your court as we say, to my\r\nmother and my brother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDamn it!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Newman, \xe2\x80\x9cI want to be polite.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood!\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Bellegarde; \xe2\x80\x9cthis will go far, it will be very\r\nentertaining. Excuse my speaking of it in that cold-blooded fashion,\r\nbut the matter must, of necessity, be for me something of a spectacle.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s positively exciting. But apart from that I sympathize with you,\r\nand I shall be actor, so far as I can, as well as spectator. You are a\r\ncapital fellow; I believe in you and I back you. The simple fact that\r\nyou appreciate my sister will serve as the proof I was asking for. All\r\nmen are equal\xe2\x80\x94especially men of taste!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think,\xe2\x80\x9d asked Newman presently, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 is\r\ndetermined not to marry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is my impression. But that is not against you; it\xe2\x80\x99s for you to\r\nmake her change her mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid it will be hard,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, gravely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think it will be easy. In a general way I don\xe2\x80\x99t see why a\r\nwidow should ever marry again. She has gained the benefits of\r\nmatrimony\xe2\x80\x94freedom and consideration\xe2\x80\x94and she has got rid of the\r\ndrawbacks. Why should she put her head into the noose again? Her usual\r\nmotive is ambition: if a man can offer her a great position, make her a\r\nprincess or an ambassadress she may think the compensation sufficient.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd\xe2\x80\x94in that way\xe2\x80\x94is Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 ambitious?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho knows?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bellegarde, with a profound shrug. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t pretend\r\nto say all that she is or all that she is not. I think she might be\r\ntouched by the prospect of becoming the wife of a great man. But in a\r\ncertain way, I believe, whatever she does will be the _improbable_.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t be too confident, but don\xe2\x80\x99t absolutely doubt. Your best chance\r\nfor success will be precisely in being, to her mind, unusual,\r\nunexpected, original. Don\xe2\x80\x99t try to be anyone else; be simply yourself,\r\nout and out. Something or other can\xe2\x80\x99t fail to come of it; I am very\r\ncurious to see what.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am much obliged to you for your advice,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nadded with a smile, \xe2\x80\x9cI am glad, for your sake, I am going to be so\r\namusing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will be more than amusing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bellegarde; \xe2\x80\x9cit will be inspiring.\r\nI look at it from my point of view, and you from yours. After all,\r\nanything for a change! And only yesterday I was yawning so as to\r\ndislocate my jaw, and declaring that there was nothing new under the\r\nsun! If it isn\xe2\x80\x99t new to see you come into the family as a suitor, I am\r\nvery much mistaken. Let me say that, my dear fellow; I won\xe2\x80\x99t call it\r\nanything else, bad or good; I will simply call it _new_.\xe2\x80\x9d And overcome\r\nwith a sense of the novelty thus foreshadowed, Valentin de Bellegarde\r\nthrew himself into a deep armchair before the fire, and, with a fixed,\r\nintense smile, seemed to read a vision of it in the flame of the logs.\r\nAfter a while he looked up. \xe2\x80\x9cGo ahead, my boy; you have my good\r\nwishes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it is really a pity you don\xe2\x80\x99t understand me,\r\nthat you don\xe2\x80\x99t know just what I am doing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, laughing, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t do anything wrong. Leave me to\r\nmyself, rather, or defy me, out and out. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t lay any load on\r\nyour conscience.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBellegarde sprang up again; he was evidently excited; there was a\r\nwarmer spark even than usual in his eye. \xe2\x80\x9cYou never will understand\xe2\x80\x94you\r\nnever will know,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cand if you succeed, and I turn out to have\r\nhelped you, you will never be grateful, not as I shall deserve you\r\nshould be. You will be an excellent fellow always, but you will not be\r\ngrateful. But it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter, for I shall get my own fun out of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAnd he broke into an extravagant laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cYou look puzzled,\xe2\x80\x9d he added;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou look almost frightened.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt _is_ a pity,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand you. I shall\r\nlose some very good jokes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told you, you remember, that we were very strange people,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nBellegarde went on. \xe2\x80\x9cI give you warning again. We are! My mother is\r\nstrange, my brother is strange, and I verily believe that I am stranger\r\nthan either. You will even find my sister a little strange. Old trees\r\nhave crooked branches, old houses have queer cracks, old races have odd\r\nsecrets. Remember that we are eight hundred years old!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman; \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s the sort of thing I came to Europe\r\nfor. You come into my programme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Touchez-l\xc3\xa0_, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bellegarde, putting out his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nbargain: I accept you; I espouse your cause. It\xe2\x80\x99s because I like you,\r\nin a great measure; but that is not the only reason!\xe2\x80\x9d And he stood\r\nholding Newman\xe2\x80\x99s hand and looking at him askance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the other one?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am in the Opposition. I dislike someone else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour brother?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Newman, in his unmodulated voice.\r\n\r\nBellegarde laid his fingers upon his lips with a whispered _hush!_ \xe2\x80\x9cOld\r\nraces have strange secrets!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cPut yourself into motion, come\r\nand see my sister, and be assured of my sympathy!\xe2\x80\x9d And on this he took\r\nhis leave.\r\n\r\nNewman dropped into a chair before his fire, and sat a long time\r\nstaring into the blaze.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n\r\nHe went to see Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 the next day, and was informed by the\r\nservant that she was at home. He passed as usual up the large, cold\r\nstaircase and through a spacious vestibule above, where the walls\r\nseemed all composed of small door panels, touched with long-faded\r\ngilding; whence he was ushered into the sitting-room in which he had\r\nalready been received. It was empty, and the servant told him that\r\nMadame la Comtesse would presently appear. He had time, while he\r\nwaited, to wonder whether Bellegarde had seen his sister since the\r\nevening before, and whether in this case he had spoken to her of their\r\ntalk. In this case Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s receiving him was an\r\nencouragement. He felt a certain trepidation as he reflected that she\r\nmight come in with the knowledge of his supreme admiration and of the\r\nproject he had built upon it in her eyes; but the feeling was not\r\ndisagreeable. Her face could wear no look that would make it less\r\nbeautiful, and he was sure beforehand that however she might take the\r\nproposal he had in reserve, she would not take it in scorn or in irony.\r\nHe had a feeling that if she could only read the bottom of his heart\r\nand measure the extent of his good will toward her, she would be\r\nentirely kind.\r\n\r\nShe came in at last, after so long an interval that he wondered whether\r\nshe had been hesitating. She smiled with her usual frankness, and held\r\nout her hand; she looked at him straight with her soft and luminous\r\neyes, and said, without a tremor in her voice, that she was glad to see\r\nhim and that she hoped he was well. He found in her what he had found\r\nbefore\xe2\x80\x94that faint perfume of a personal shyness worn away by contact\r\nwith the world, but the more perceptible the more closely you\r\napproached her. This lingering diffidence seemed to give a peculiar\r\nvalue to what was definite and assured in her manner; it made it seem\r\nlike an accomplishment, a beautiful talent, something that one might\r\ncompare to an exquisite touch in a pianist. It was, in fact, Madame de\r\nCintr\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cauthority,\xe2\x80\x9d as they say of artists, that especially impressed\r\nand fascinated Newman; he always came back to the feeling that when he\r\nshould complete himself by taking a wife, that was the way he should\r\nlike his wife to interpret him to the world. The only trouble, indeed,\r\nwas that when the instrument was so perfect it seemed to interpose too\r\nmuch between you and the genius that used it. Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 gave\r\nNewman the sense of an elaborate education, of her having passed\r\nthrough mysterious ceremonies and processes of culture in her youth, of\r\nher having been fashioned and made flexible to certain exalted social\r\nneeds. All this, as I have affirmed, made her seem rare and precious\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nvery expensive article, as he would have said, and one which a man with\r\nan ambition to have everything about him of the best would find it\r\nhighly agreeable to possess. But looking at the matter with an eye to\r\nprivate felicity, Newman wondered where, in so exquisite a compound,\r\nnature and art showed their dividing line. Where did the special\r\nintention separate from the habit of good manners? Where did urbanity\r\nend and sincerity begin? Newman asked himself these questions even\r\nwhile he stood ready to accept the admired object in all its\r\ncomplexity; he felt that he could do so in profound security, and\r\nexamine its mechanism afterwards, at leisure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very glad to find you alone,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know I have never had\r\nsuch good luck before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you have seemed before very well contented with your luck,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMadame de Cintr\xc3\xa9. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have sat and watched my visitors with an air of\r\nquiet amusement. What have you thought of them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I have thought the ladies were very elegant and very graceful, and\r\nwonderfully quick at repartee. But what I have chiefly thought has been\r\nthat they only helped me to admire you.\xe2\x80\x9d This was not gallantry on\r\nNewman\xe2\x80\x99s part\xe2\x80\x94an art in which he was quite unversed. It was simply the\r\ninstinct of the practical man, who had made up his mind what he wanted,\r\nand was now beginning to take active steps to obtain it.\r\n\r\nMadame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 started slightly, and raised her eyebrows; she had\r\nevidently not expected so fervid a compliment. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, in that case,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid with a laugh, \xe2\x80\x9cyour finding me alone is not good luck for me. I\r\nhope someone will come in quickly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cI have something particular to say to you.\r\nHave you seen your brother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I saw him an hour ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid he tell you that he had seen me last night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe said so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd did he tell you what we had talked about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 hesitated a moment. As Newman asked these questions\r\nshe had grown a little pale, as if she regarded what was coming as\r\nnecessary, but not as agreeable. \xe2\x80\x9cDid you give him a message to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was not exactly a message\xe2\x80\x94I asked him to render me a service.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe service was to sing your praises, was it not?\xe2\x80\x9d And she accompanied\r\nthis question with a little smile, as if to make it easier to herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that is what it really amounts to,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cDid he sing my\r\npraises?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe spoke very well of you. But when I know that it was by your special\r\nrequest, of course I must take his eulogy with a grain of salt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that makes no difference,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cYour brother would not\r\nhave spoken well of me unless he believed what he was saying. He is too\r\nhonest for that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you very deep?\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you trying to please\r\nme by praising my brother? I confess it is a good way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor me, any way that succeeds will be good. I will praise your brother\r\nall day, if that will help me. He is a noble little fellow. He has made\r\nme feel, in promising to do what he can to help me, that I can depend\r\nupon him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t make too much of that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9. \xe2\x80\x9cHe can help you\r\nvery little.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I must work my way myself. I know that very well; I only\r\nwant a chance to. In consenting to see me, after what he told you, you\r\nalmost seem to be giving me a chance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am seeing you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9, slowly and gravely, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause\r\nI promised my brother I would.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBlessings on your brother\xe2\x80\x99s head!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat I told him last\r\nevening was this: that I admired you more than any woman I had ever\r\nseen, and that I should like immensely to make you my wife.\xe2\x80\x9d He uttered\r\nthese words with great directness and firmness, and without any sense\r\nof confusion. He was full of his idea, he had completely mastered it,\r\nand he seemed to look down on Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9, with all her gathered\r\nelegance, from the height of his bracing good conscience. It is\r\nprobable that this particular tone and manner were the very best he\r\ncould have hit upon. Yet the light, just visibly forced smile with\r\nwhich his companion had listened to him died away, and she sat looking\r\nat him with her lips parted and her face as solemn as a tragic mask.\r\nThere was evidently something very painful to her in the scene to which\r\nhe was subjecting her, and yet her impatience of it found no angry\r\nvoice. Newman wondered whether he was hurting her; he could not imagine\r\nwhy the liberal devotion he meant to express should be disagreeable. He\r\ngot up and stood before her, leaning one hand on the chimney-piece. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nknow I have seen you very little to say this,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cso little that\r\nit may make what I say seem disrespectful. That is my misfortune! I\r\ncould have said it the first time I saw you. Really, I had seen you\r\nbefore; I had seen you in imagination; you seemed almost an old friend.\r\nSo what I say is not mere gallantry and compliments and nonsense\xe2\x80\x94I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t talk that way, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how, and I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, to you, if I\r\ncould. It\xe2\x80\x99s as serious as such words can be. I feel as if I knew you\r\nand knew what a beautiful, admirable woman you are. I shall know\r\nbetter, perhaps, some day, but I have a general notion now. You are\r\njust the woman I have been looking for, except that you are far more\r\nperfect. I won\xe2\x80\x99t make any protestations and vows, but you can trust me.\r\nIt is very soon, I know, to say all this; it is almost offensive. But\r\nwhy not gain time if one can? And if you want time to reflect\xe2\x80\x94of course\r\nyou do\xe2\x80\x94the sooner you begin, the better for me. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you\r\nthink of me; but there is no great mystery about me; you see what I am.\r\nYour brother told me that my antecedents and occupations were against\r\nme; that your family stands, somehow, on a higher level than I do. That\r\nis an idea which of course I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand and don\xe2\x80\x99t accept. But you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t care anything about that. I can assure you that I am a very solid\r\nfellow, and that if I give my mind to it I can arrange things so that\r\nin a very few years I shall not need to waste time in explaining who I\r\nam and what I am. You will decide for yourself whether you like me or\r\nnot. What there is you see before you. I honestly believe I have no\r\nhidden vices or nasty tricks. I am kind, kind, kind! Everything that a\r\nman can give a woman I will give you. I have a large fortune, a very\r\nlarge fortune; some day, if you will allow me, I will go into details.\r\nIf you want brilliancy, everything in the way of brilliancy that money\r\ncan give you, you shall have. And as regards anything you may give up,\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t take for granted too much that its place cannot be filled. Leave\r\nthat to me; I\xe2\x80\x99ll take care of you; I shall know what you need. Energy\r\nand ingenuity can arrange everything. I\xe2\x80\x99m a strong man! There, I have\r\nsaid what I had on my heart! It was better to get it off. I am very\r\nsorry if it\xe2\x80\x99s disagreeable to you; but think how much better it is that\r\nthings should be clear. Don\xe2\x80\x99t answer me now, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t wish it.\r\nThink about it, think about it as slowly as you please. Of course I\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t said, I can\xe2\x80\x99t say, half I mean, especially about my admiration\r\nfor you. But take a favorable view of me; it will only be just.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuring this speech, the longest that Newman had ever made, Madame de\r\nCintr\xc3\xa9 kept her gaze fixed upon him, and it expanded at the last into a\r\nsort of fascinated stare. When he ceased speaking she lowered her eyes\r\nand sat for some moments looking down and straight before her. Then she\r\nslowly rose to her feet, and a pair of exceptionally keen eyes would\r\nhave perceived that she was trembling a little in the movement. She\r\nstill looked extremely serious. \xe2\x80\x9cI am very much obliged to you for your\r\noffer,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt seems very strange, but I am glad you spoke\r\nwithout waiting any longer. It is better the subject should be\r\ndismissed. I appreciate all you say; you do me great honor. But I have\r\ndecided not to marry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t say that!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Newman, in a tone absolutely _na\xc3\xaff_ from\r\nits pleading and caressing cadence. She had turned away, and it made\r\nher stop a moment with her back to him. \xe2\x80\x9cThink better of that. You are\r\ntoo young, too beautiful, too much made to be happy and to make others\r\nhappy. If you are afraid of losing your freedom, I can assure you that\r\nthis freedom here, this life you now lead, is a dreary bondage to what\r\nI will offer you. You shall do things that I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you have ever\r\nthought of. I will take you anywhere in the wide world that you\r\npropose. Are you unhappy? You give me a feeling that you _are_ unhappy.\r\nYou have no right to be, or to be made so. Let me come in and put an\r\nend to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 stood there a moment longer, looking away from him. If\r\nshe was touched by the way he spoke, the thing was conceivable. His\r\nvoice, always very mild and interrogative, gradually became as soft and\r\nas tenderly argumentative as if he had been talking to a much-loved\r\nchild. He stood watching her, and she presently turned round again, but\r\nthis time she did not look at him, and she spoke in a quietness in\r\nwhich there was a visible trace of effort.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are a great many reasons why I should not marry,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmore than I can explain to you. As for my happiness, I am very happy.\r\nYour offer seems strange to me, for more reasons also than I can say.\r\nOf course you have a perfect right to make it. But I cannot accept\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94it is impossible. Please never speak of this matter again. If you\r\ncannot promise me this, I must ask you not to come back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy is it impossible?\xe2\x80\x9d Newman demanded. \xe2\x80\x9cYou may think it is, at\r\nfirst, without its really being so. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t expect you to be pleased\r\nat first, but I do believe that if you will think of it a good while,\r\nyou may be satisfied.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9. \xe2\x80\x9cThink how little I know\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery little, of course, and therefore I don\xe2\x80\x99t ask for your ultimatum\r\non the spot. I only ask you not to say no, and to let me hope. I will\r\nwait as long as you desire. Meanwhile you can see more of me and know\r\nme better, look at me as a possible husband\xe2\x80\x94as a candidate\xe2\x80\x94and make up\r\nyour mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSomething was going on, rapidly, in Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts; she\r\nwas weighing a question there, beneath Newman\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, weighing it and\r\ndeciding it. \xe2\x80\x9cFrom the moment I don\xe2\x80\x99t very respectfully beg you to\r\nleave the house and never return,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI listen to you, I seem\r\nto give you hope. I _have_ listened to you\xe2\x80\x94against my judgment. It is\r\nbecause you are eloquent. If I had been told this morning that I should\r\nconsent to consider you as a possible husband, I should have thought my\r\ninformant a little crazy. I _am_ listening to you, you see!\xe2\x80\x9d And she\r\nthrew her hands out for a moment and let them drop with a gesture in\r\nwhich there was just the slightest expression of appealing weakness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, as far as saying goes, I have said everything,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nbelieve in you, without restriction, and I think all the good of you\r\nthat it is possible to think of a human creature. I firmly believe that\r\nin marrying me you will be _safe_. As I said just now,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on with\r\na smile, \xe2\x80\x9cI have no bad ways. I can _do_ so much for you. And if you\r\nare afraid that I am not what you have been accustomed to, not refined\r\nand delicate and punctilious, you may easily carry that too far. I _am_\r\ndelicate! You shall see!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 walked some distance away, and paused before a great\r\nplant, an azalea, which was flourishing in a porcelain tub before her\r\nwindow. She plucked off one of the flowers and, twisting it in her\r\nfingers, retraced her steps. Then she sat down in silence, and her\r\nattitude seemed to be a consent that Newman should say more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should you say it is impossible you should marry?\xe2\x80\x9d he continued.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe only thing that could make it really impossible would be your\r\nbeing already married. Is it because you have been unhappy in marriage?\r\nThat is all the more reason! Is it because your family exert a pressure\r\nupon you, interfere with you, annoy you? That is still another reason;\r\nyou ought to be perfectly free, and marriage will make you so. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsay anything against your family\xe2\x80\x94understand that!\xe2\x80\x9d added Newman, with\r\nan eagerness which might have made a perspicacious observer smile.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever way you feel toward them is the right way, and anything that\r\nyou should wish me to do to make myself agreeable to them I will do as\r\nwell as I know how. Depend upon that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 rose again and came toward the fireplace, near which\r\nNewman was standing. The expression of pain and embarrassment had\r\npassed out of her face, and it was illuminated with something which,\r\nthis time at least, Newman need not have been perplexed whether to\r\nattribute to habit or to intention, to art or to nature. She had the\r\nair of a woman who has stepped across the frontier of friendship and,\r\nlooking around her, finds the region vast. A certain checked and\r\ncontrolled exaltation seemed mingled with the usual level radiance of\r\nher glance. \xe2\x80\x9cI will not refuse to see you again,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause\r\nmuch of what you have said has given me pleasure. But I will see you\r\nonly on this condition: that you say nothing more in the same way for a\r\nlong time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor how long?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor six months. It must be a solemn promise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, I promise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye, then,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and extended her hand.\r\n\r\nHe held it a moment, as if he were going to say something more. But he\r\nonly looked at her; then he took his departure.\r\n\r\nThat evening, on the Boulevard, he met Valentin de Bellegarde. After\r\nthey had exchanged greetings, Newman told him that he had seen Madame\r\nde Cintr\xc3\xa9 a few hours before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bellegarde. \xe2\x80\x9cI dined in the Rue de l\xe2\x80\x99Universit\xc3\xa9.\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nthen, for some moments, both men were silent. Newman wished to ask\r\nBellegarde what visible impression his visit had made and the Count\r\nValentin had a question of his own. Bellegarde spoke first.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s none of my business, but what the deuce did you say to my\r\nsister?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am willing to tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I made her an offer of\r\nmarriage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlready!\xe2\x80\x9d And the young man gave a whistle. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Time is money!\xe2\x80\x99 Is that\r\nwhat you say in America? And Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9?\xe2\x80\x9d he added, with an\r\ninterrogative inflection.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe did not accept my offer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t, you know, in that way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99m to see her again,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, the strangeness of woman!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Bellegarde. Then he stopped,\r\nand held Newman off at arms\xe2\x80\x99-length. \xe2\x80\x9cI look at you with respect!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nexclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have achieved what we call a personal success!\r\nImmediately, now, I must present you to my brother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhenever you please!\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n\r\nNewman continued to see his friends the Tristrams with a good deal of\r\nfrequency, though if you had listened to Mrs. Tristram\xe2\x80\x99s account of the\r\nmatter you would have supposed that they had been cynically repudiated\r\nfor the sake of grander acquaintance. \xe2\x80\x9cWe were all very well so long as\r\nwe had no rivals\xe2\x80\x94we were better than nothing. But now that you have\r\nbecome the fashion, and have your pick every day of three invitations\r\nto dinner, we are tossed into the corner. I am sure it is very good of\r\nyou to come and see us once a month; I wonder you don\xe2\x80\x99t send us your\r\ncards in an envelope. When you do, pray have them with black edges; it\r\nwill be for the death of my last illusion.\xe2\x80\x9d It was in this incisive\r\nstrain that Mrs. Tristram moralized over Newman\xe2\x80\x99s so-called neglect,\r\nwhich was in reality a most exemplary constancy. Of course she was\r\njoking, but there was always something ironical in her jokes, as there\r\nwas always something jocular in her gravity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know no better proof that I have treated you very well,\xe2\x80\x9d Newman had\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cthan the fact that you make so free with my character.\r\nFamiliarity breeds contempt; I have made myself too cheap. If I had a\r\nlittle proper pride I would stay away a while, and when you asked me to\r\ndinner say I was going to the Princess Borealska\xe2\x80\x99s. But I have not any\r\npride where my pleasure is concerned, and to keep you in the humor to\r\nsee me\xe2\x80\x94if you must see me only to call me bad names\xe2\x80\x94I will agree to\r\nanything you choose; I will admit that I am the biggest snob in Paris.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nNewman, in fact, had declined an invitation personally given by the\r\nPrincess Borealska, an inquiring Polish lady to whom he had been\r\npresented, on the ground that on that particular day he always dined at\r\nMrs. Tristram\xe2\x80\x99s; and it was only a tenderly perverse theory of his\r\nhostess of the Avenue d\xe2\x80\x99I\xc3\xa9na that he was faithless to his early\r\nfriendships. She needed the theory to explain a certain moral\r\nirritation by which she was often visited; though, if this explanation\r\nwas unsound, a deeper analyst than I must give the right one. Having\r\nlaunched our hero upon the current which was bearing him so rapidly\r\nalong, she appeared but half-pleased at its swiftness. She had\r\nsucceeded too well; she had played her game too cleverly and she wished\r\nto mix up the cards. Newman had told her, in due season, that her\r\nfriend was \xe2\x80\x9csatisfactory.\xe2\x80\x9d The epithet was not romantic, but Mrs.\r\nTristram had no difficulty in perceiving that, in essentials, the\r\nfeeling which lay beneath it was. Indeed, the mild, expansive brevity\r\nwith which it was uttered, and a certain look, at once appealing and\r\ninscrutable, that issued from Newman\xe2\x80\x99s half-closed eyes as he leaned\r\nhis head against the back of his chair, seemed to her the most eloquent\r\nattestation of a mature sentiment that she had ever encountered. Newman\r\nwas, according to the French phrase, only abounding in her own sense,\r\nbut his temperate raptures exerted a singular effect upon the ardor\r\nwhich she herself had so freely manifested a few months before. She now\r\nseemed inclined to take a purely critical view of Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9, and\r\nwished to have it understood that she did not in the least answer for\r\nher being a compendium of all the virtues. \xe2\x80\x9cNo woman was ever so good\r\nas that woman seems,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cRemember what Shakespeare calls\r\nDesdemona; \xe2\x80\x98a supersubtle Venetian.\xe2\x80\x99 Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 is a supersubtle\r\nParisian. She is a charming woman, and she has five hundred merits; but\r\nyou had better keep that in mind.\xe2\x80\x9d Was Mrs. Tristram simply finding out\r\nthat she was jealous of her dear friend on the other side of the Seine,\r\nand that in undertaking to provide Newman with an ideal wife she had\r\ncounted too much on her own disinterestedness? We may be permitted to\r\ndoubt it. The inconsistent little lady of the Avenue d\xe2\x80\x99I\xc3\xa9na had an\r\ninsuperable need of changing her place, intellectually. She had a\r\nlively imagination, and she was capable, at certain times, of imagining\r\nthe direct reverse of her most cherished beliefs, with a vividness more\r\nintense than that of conviction. She got tired of thinking aright; but\r\nthere was no serious harm in it, as she got equally tired of thinking\r\nwrong. In the midst of her mysterious perversities she had admirable\r\nflashes of justice. One of these occurred when Newman related to her\r\nthat he had made a formal proposal to Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9. He repeated in\r\na few words what he had said, and in a great many what she had\r\nanswered. Mrs. Tristram listened with extreme interest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut after all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is nothing to congratulate me\r\nupon. It is not a triumph.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Tristram; \xe2\x80\x9cit is a great triumph. It is\r\na great triumph that she did not silence you at the first word, and\r\nrequest you never to speak to her again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see that,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course you don\xe2\x80\x99t; Heaven forbid you should! When I told you to go\r\non your own way and do what came into your head, I had no idea you\r\nwould go over the ground so fast. I never dreamed you would offer\r\nyourself after five or six morning-calls. As yet, what had you done to\r\nmake her like you? You had simply sat\xe2\x80\x94not very straight\xe2\x80\x94and stared at\r\nher. But she does like you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat remains to be seen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, that is proved. What will come of it remains to be seen. That you\r\nshould propose to marry her, without more ado, could never have come\r\ninto her head. You can form very little idea of what passed through her\r\nmind as you spoke; if she ever really marries you, the affair will be\r\ncharacterized by the usual justice of all human beings towards women.\r\nYou will think you take generous views of her; but you will never begin\r\nto know through what a strange sea of feeling she passed before she\r\naccepted you. As she stood there in front of you the other day, she\r\nplunged into it. She said \xe2\x80\x98Why not?\xe2\x80\x99 to something which, a few hours\r\nearlier, had been inconceivable. She turned about on a thousand\r\ngathered prejudices and traditions as on a pivot, and looked where she\r\nhad never looked hitherto. When I think of it\xe2\x80\x94when I think of Claire de\r\nCintr\xc3\xa9 and all that she represents, there seems to me something very\r\nfine in it. When I recommended you to try your fortune with her I of\r\ncourse thought well of you, and in spite of your sins I think so still.\r\nBut I confess I don\xe2\x80\x99t see quite what you are and what you have done, to\r\nmake such a woman do this sort of thing for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, there is something very fine in it!\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman with a laugh,\r\nrepeating her words. He took an extreme satisfaction in hearing that\r\nthere was something fine in it. He had not the least doubt of it\r\nhimself, but he had already begun to value the world\xe2\x80\x99s admiration of\r\nMadame de Cintr\xc3\xa9, as adding to the prospective glory of possession.\r\n\r\nIt was immediately after this conversation that Valentin de Bellegarde\r\ncame to conduct his friend to the Rue de l\xe2\x80\x99Universit\xc3\xa9 to present him to\r\nthe other members of his family. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are already introduced,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand you have begun to be talked about. My sister has mentioned your\r\nsuccessive visits to my mother, and it was an accident that my mother\r\nwas present at none of them. I have spoken of you as an American of\r\nimmense wealth, and the best fellow in the world, who is looking for\r\nsomething very superior in the way of a wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d asked Newman, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 has related to\r\nyour mother the last conversation I had with her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very certain that she has not; she will keep her own counsel.\r\nMeanwhile you must make your way with the rest of the family. Thus much\r\nis known about you: you have made a great fortune in trade, you are a\r\nlittle eccentric, and you frankly admire our dear Claire. My\r\nsister-in-law, whom you remember seeing in Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsitting-room, took, it appears, a fancy to you; she has described you\r\nas having _beaucoup de cachet_. My mother, therefore, is curious to see\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe expects to laugh at me, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe never laughs. If she does not like you, don\xe2\x80\x99t hope to purchase\r\nfavor by being amusing. Take warning by me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis conversation took place in the evening, and half an hour later\r\nValentin ushered his companion into an apartment of the house of the\r\nRue de l\xe2\x80\x99Universit\xc3\xa9 into which he had not yet penetrated, the salon of\r\nthe dowager Marquise de Bellegarde. It was a vast, high room, with\r\nelaborate and ponderous mouldings, painted a whitish gray, along the\r\nupper portion of the walls and the ceiling; with a great deal of faded\r\nand carefully repaired tapestry in the doorways and chair-backs; a\r\nTurkey carpet in light colors, still soft and deep, in spite of great\r\nantiquity, on the floor, and portraits of each of Madame de\r\nBellegarde\xe2\x80\x99s children, at the age of ten, suspended against an old\r\nscreen of red silk. The room was illumined, exactly enough for\r\nconversation, by half a dozen candles, placed in odd corners, at a\r\ngreat distance apart. In a deep armchair, near the fire, sat an old\r\nlady in black; at the other end of the room another person was seated\r\nat the piano, playing a very expressive waltz. In this latter person\r\nNewman recognized the young Marquise de Bellegarde.\r\n\r\nValentin presented his friend, and Newman walked up to the old lady by\r\nthe fire and shook hands with her. He received a rapid impression of a\r\nwhite, delicate, aged face, with a high forehead, a small mouth, and a\r\npair of cold blue eyes which had kept much of the freshness of youth.\r\nMadame de Bellegarde looked hard at him, and returned his hand-shake\r\nwith a sort of British positiveness which reminded him that she was the\r\ndaughter of the Earl of St. Dunstan\xe2\x80\x99s. Her daughter-in-law stopped\r\nplaying and gave him an agreeable smile. Newman sat down and looked\r\nabout him, while Valentin went and kissed the hand of the young\r\nmarquise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ought to have seen you before,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de Bellegarde. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have\r\npaid several visits to my daughter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, smiling; \xe2\x80\x9cMadame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 and I are old\r\nfriends by this time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have gone fast,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de Bellegarde.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot so fast as I should like,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, bravely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you are very ambitious,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the old lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I confess I am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, smiling.\r\n\r\nMadame de Bellegarde looked at him with her cold fine eyes, and he\r\nreturned her gaze, reflecting that she was a possible adversary and\r\ntrying to take her measure. Their eyes remained in contact for some\r\nmoments. Then Madame de Bellegarde looked away, and without smiling, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nam very ambitious, too,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nNewman felt that taking her measure was not easy; she was a formidable,\r\ninscrutable little woman. She resembled her daughter, and yet she was\r\nutterly unlike her. The coloring in Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 was the same, and\r\nthe high delicacy of her brow and nose was hereditary. But her face was\r\na larger and freer copy, and her mouth in especial a happy divergence\r\nfrom that conservative orifice, a little pair of lips at once plump and\r\npinched, that looked, when closed, as if they could not open wider than\r\nto swallow a gooseberry or to emit an \xe2\x80\x9cOh, dear, no!\xe2\x80\x9d which probably\r\nhad been thought to give the finishing touch to the aristocratic\r\nprettiness of the Lady Emmeline Atheling as represented, forty years\r\nbefore, in several Books of Beauty. Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s face had, to\r\nNewman\xe2\x80\x99s eye, a range of expression as delightfully vast as the\r\nwind-streaked, cloud-flecked distance on a Western prairie. But her\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s white, intense, respectable countenance, with its formal gaze,\r\nand its circumscribed smile, suggested a document signed and sealed; a\r\nthing of parchment, ink, and ruled lines. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is a woman of\r\nconventions and proprieties,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself as he looked at her;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cher world is the world of things immutably decreed. But how she is at\r\nhome in it, and what a paradise she finds it. She walks about in it as\r\nif it were a blooming park, a Garden of Eden; and when she sees \xe2\x80\x98This\r\nis genteel,\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98This is improper,\xe2\x80\x99 written on a mile-stone she stops\r\necstatically, as if she were listening to a nightingale or smelling a\r\nrose.\xe2\x80\x9d Madame de Bellegarde wore a little black velvet hood tied under\r\nher chin, and she was wrapped in an old black cashmere shawl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are an American?\xe2\x80\x9d she said presently. \xe2\x80\x9cI have seen several\r\nAmericans.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are several in Paris,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman jocosely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, really?\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de Bellegarde. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was in England I saw\r\nthese, or somewhere else; not in Paris. I think it must have been in\r\nthe Pyrenees, many years ago. I am told your ladies are very pretty.\r\nOne of these ladies was very pretty! such a wonderful complexion! She\r\npresented me a note of introduction from someone\xe2\x80\x94I forgot whom\xe2\x80\x94and she\r\nsent with it a note of her own. I kept her letter a long time\r\nafterwards, it was so strangely expressed. I used to know some of the\r\nphrases by heart. But I have forgotten them now, it is so many years\r\nago. Since then I have seen no more Americans. I think my\r\ndaughter-in-law has; she is a great gad-about, she sees everyone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this the younger lady came rustling forward, pinching in a very\r\nslender waist, and casting idly preoccupied glances over the front of\r\nher dress, which was apparently designed for a ball. She was, in a\r\nsingular way, at once ugly and pretty; she had protuberant eyes, and\r\nlips strangely red. She reminded Newman of his friend, Mademoiselle\r\nNioche; this was what that much-obstructed young lady would have liked\r\nto be. Valentin de Bellegarde walked behind her at a distance, hopping\r\nabout to keep off the far-spreading train of her dress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to show more of your shoulders behind,\xe2\x80\x9d he said very\r\ngravely. \xe2\x80\x9cYou might as well wear a standing ruff as such a dress as\r\nthat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young woman turned her back to the mirror over the chimney-piece,\r\nand glanced behind her, to verify Valentin\xe2\x80\x99s assertion. The mirror\r\ndescended low, and yet it reflected nothing but a large unclad flesh\r\nsurface. The young marquise put her hands behind her and gave a\r\ndownward pull to the waist of her dress. \xe2\x80\x9cLike that, you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is a little better,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bellegarde in the same tone, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it\r\nleaves a good deal to be desired.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I never go to extremes,\xe2\x80\x9d said his sister-in-law. And then, turning\r\nto Madame de Bellegarde, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat were you calling me just now, madame?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI called you a gad-about,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old lady. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I might call you\r\nsomething else, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA gad-about? What an ugly word! What does it mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA very beautiful person,\xe2\x80\x9d Newman ventured to say, seeing that it was\r\nin French.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is a pretty compliment but a bad translation,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young\r\nmarquise. And then, looking at him a moment, \xe2\x80\x9cDo you dance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a step.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are very wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, simply. And with another look at her\r\nback in the mirror she turned away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you like Paris?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the old lady, who was apparently wondering\r\nwhat was the proper way to talk to an American.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, rather,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. And then he added with a friendly\r\nintonation, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t say I know it. I know my house\xe2\x80\x94I know my friends\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nParis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you lose a great deal,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, sympathetically.\r\n\r\nMadame de Bellegarde stared; it was presumably the first time she had\r\nbeen condoled with on her losses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am content with what I have,\xe2\x80\x9d she said with dignity.\r\n\r\nNewman\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, at this moment, were wandering round the room, which\r\nstruck him as rather sad and shabby; passing from the high casements,\r\nwith their small, thickly-framed panes, to the sallow tints of two or\r\nthree portraits in pastel, of the last century, which hung between\r\nthem. He ought, obviously, to have answered that the contentment of his\r\nhostess was quite natural\xe2\x80\x94she had a great deal; but the idea did not\r\noccur to him during the pause of some moments which followed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my dear mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Valentin, coming and leaning against the\r\nchimney-piece, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat do you think of my dear friend Newman? Is he not\r\nthe excellent fellow I told you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy acquaintance with Mr. Newman has not gone very far,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de\r\nBellegarde. \xe2\x80\x9cI can as yet only appreciate his great politeness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy mother is a great judge of these matters,\xe2\x80\x9d said Valentin to Newman.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you have satisfied her, it is a triumph.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope I shall satisfy you, some day,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, looking at the old\r\nlady. \xe2\x80\x9cI have done nothing yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must not listen to my son; he will bring you into trouble. He is a\r\nsad scatterbrain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I like him\xe2\x80\x94I like him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, genially.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe amuses you, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, perfectly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you hear that, Valentin?\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de Bellegarde. \xe2\x80\x9cYou amuse Mr.\r\nNewman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps we shall all come to that!\xe2\x80\x9d Valentin exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must see my other son,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de Bellegarde. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is much\r\nbetter than this one. But he will not amuse you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t know!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Valentin, reflectively. \xe2\x80\x9cBut we\r\nshall very soon see. Here comes _Monsieur mon fr\xc3\xa8re_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe door had just opened to give ingress to a gentleman who stepped\r\nforward and whose face Newman remembered. He had been the author of our\r\nhero\xe2\x80\x99s discomfiture the first time he tried to present himself to\r\nMadame de Cintr\xc3\xa9. Valentin de Bellegarde went to meet his brother,\r\nlooked at him a moment, and then, taking him by the arm, led him up to\r\nNewman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is my excellent friend Mr. Newman,\xe2\x80\x9d he said very blandly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nmust know him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am delighted to know Mr. Newman,\xe2\x80\x9d said the marquis with a low bow,\r\nbut without offering his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is the old woman at second-hand,\xe2\x80\x9d Newman said to himself, as he\r\nreturned M. de Bellegarde\xe2\x80\x99s greeting. And this was the starting-point\r\nof a speculative theory, in his mind, that the late marquis had been a\r\nvery amiable foreigner, with an inclination to take life easily and a\r\nsense that it was difficult for the husband of the stilted little lady\r\nby the fire to do so. But if he had taken little comfort in his wife he\r\nhad taken much in his two younger children, who were after his own\r\nheart, while Madame de Bellegarde had paired with her eldest-born.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy brother has spoken to me of you,\xe2\x80\x9d said M. de Bellegarde; \xe2\x80\x9cand as\r\nyou are also acquainted with my sister, it was time we should meet.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nturned to his mother and gallantly bent over her hand, touching it with\r\nhis lips, and then he assumed an attitude before the chimney-piece.\r\nWith his long, lean face, his high-bridged nose and his small, opaque\r\neye he looked much like an Englishman. His whiskers were fair and\r\nglossy, and he had a large dimple, of unmistakably British origin, in\r\nthe middle of his handsome chin. He was \xe2\x80\x9cdistinguished\xe2\x80\x9d to the tips of\r\nhis polished nails, and there was not a movement of his fine,\r\nperpendicular person that was not noble and majestic. Newman had never\r\nyet been confronted with such an incarnation of the art of taking one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nself seriously; he felt a sort of impulse to step backward, as you do\r\nto get a view of a great fa\xc3\xa7ade.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUrbain,\xe2\x80\x9d said young Madame de Bellegarde, who had apparently been\r\nwaiting for her husband to take her to her ball, \xe2\x80\x9cI call your attention\r\nto the fact that I am dressed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is a good idea,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Valentin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am at your orders, my dear friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said M. de Bellegarde. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly,\r\nyou must allow me first the pleasure of a little conversation with Mr.\r\nNewman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, if you are going to a party, don\xe2\x80\x99t let me keep you,\xe2\x80\x9d objected\r\nNewman. \xe2\x80\x9cI am very sure we shall meet again. Indeed, if you would like\r\nto converse with me I will gladly name an hour.\xe2\x80\x9d He was eager to make\r\nit known that he would readily answer all questions and satisfy all\r\nexactions.\r\n\r\nM. de Bellegarde stood in a well-balanced position before the fire,\r\ncaressing one of his fair whiskers with one of his white hands, and\r\nlooking at Newman, half askance, with eyes from which a particular ray\r\nof observation made its way through a general meaningless smile. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is\r\nvery kind of you to make such an offer,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I am not\r\nmistaken, your occupations are such as to make your time precious. You\r\nare in\xe2\x80\x94a\xe2\x80\x94as we say, _dans les affaires_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn business, you mean? Oh no, I have thrown business overboard for the\r\npresent. I am \xe2\x80\x98loafing,\xe2\x80\x99 as _we_ say. My time is quite my own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you are taking a holiday,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined M. de Bellegarde. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Loafing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nYes, I have heard that expression.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Newman is American,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de Bellegarde.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy brother is a great ethnologist,\xe2\x80\x9d said Valentin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn ethnologist?\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, you collect negroes\xe2\x80\x99 skulls, and\r\nthat sort of thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe marquis looked hard at his brother, and began to caress his other\r\nwhisker. Then, turning to Newman, with sustained urbanity, \xe2\x80\x9cYou are\r\ntraveling for your pleasure?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I am knocking about to pick up one thing and another. Of course I\r\nget a good deal of pleasure out of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat especially interests you?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the marquis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, everything interests me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cI am not particular.\r\nManufactures are what I care most about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat has been your specialty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t say I have any specialty. My specialty has been to make the\r\nlargest possible fortune in the shortest possible time.\xe2\x80\x9d Newman made\r\nthis last remark very deliberately; he wished to open the way, if it\r\nwere necessary, to an authoritative statement of his means.\r\n\r\nM. de Bellegarde laughed agreeably. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope you have succeeded,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I have made a fortune in a reasonable time. I am not so old, you\r\nsee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cParis is a very good place to spend a fortune. I wish you great\r\nenjoyment of yours.\xe2\x80\x9d And M. de Bellegarde drew forth his gloves and\r\nbegan to put them on.\r\n\r\nNewman for a few moments watched him sliding his white hands into the\r\nwhite kid, and as he did so his feelings took a singular turn. M. de\r\nBellegarde\xe2\x80\x99s good wishes seemed to descend out of the white expanse of\r\nhis sublime serenity with the soft, scattered movement of a shower of\r\nsnow-flakes. Yet Newman was not irritated; he did not feel that he was\r\nbeing patronized; he was conscious of no especial impulse to introduce\r\na discord into so noble a harmony. Only he felt himself suddenly in\r\npersonal contact with the forces with which his friend Valentin had\r\ntold him that he would have to contend, and he became sensible of their\r\nintensity. He wished to make some answering manifestation, to stretch\r\nhimself out at his own length, to sound a note at the uttermost end of\r\n_his_ scale. It must be added that if this impulse was not vicious or\r\nmalicious, it was by no means void of humorous expectancy. Newman was\r\nquite as ready to give play to that loosely-adjusted smile of his, if\r\nhis hosts should happen to be shocked, as he was far from deliberately\r\nplanning to shock them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cParis is a very good place for idle people,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cor it is a very\r\ngood place if your family has been settled here for a long time, and\r\nyou have made acquaintances and got your relations round you; or if you\r\nhave got a good big house like this, and a wife and children and mother\r\nand sister, and everything comfortable. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like that way of living\r\nall in rooms next door to each other. But I am not an idler. I try to\r\nbe, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t manage it; it goes against the grain. My business\r\nhabits are too deep-seated. Then, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t any house to call my own,\r\nor anything in the way of a family. My sisters are five thousand miles\r\naway, my mother died when I was a youngster, and I haven\xe2\x80\x99t any wife; I\r\nwish I had! So, you see, I don\xe2\x80\x99t exactly know what to do with myself. I\r\nam not fond of books, as you are, sir, and I get tired of dining out\r\nand going to the opera. I miss my business activity. You see, I began\r\nto earn my living when I was almost a baby, and until a few months ago\r\nI have never had my hand off the plow. Elegant leisure comes hard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis speech was followed by a profound silence of some moments, on the\r\npart of Newman\xe2\x80\x99s entertainers. Valentin stood looking at him fixedly,\r\nwith his hands in his pockets, and then he slowly, with a half-sidling\r\nmotion, went out of the door. The marquis continued to draw on his\r\ngloves and to smile benignantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou began to earn your living when you were a mere baby?\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nmarquise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHardly more\xe2\x80\x94a small boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou say you are not fond of books,\xe2\x80\x9d said M. de Bellegarde; \xe2\x80\x9cbut you\r\nmust do yourself the justice to remember that your studies were\r\ninterrupted early.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is very true; on my tenth birthday I stopped going to school. I\r\nthought it was a grand way to keep it. But I picked up some information\r\nafterwards,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, reassuringly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have some sisters?\xe2\x80\x9d asked old Madame de Bellegarde.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, two sisters. Splendid women!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope that for them the hardships of life commenced less early.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey married very early, if you call that a hardship, as girls do in\r\nour Western country. One of them is married to the owner of the largest\r\nindia-rubber house in the West.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you make houses also of india-rubber?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the marquise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can stretch them as your family increases,\xe2\x80\x9d said young Madame de\r\nBellegarde, who was muffling herself in a long white shawl.\r\n\r\nNewman indulged in a burst of hilarity, and explained that the house in\r\nwhich his brother-in-law lived was a large wooden structure, but that\r\nhe manufactured and sold india-rubber on a colossal scale.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy children have some little india-rubber shoes which they put on when\r\nthey go to play in the Tuileries in damp weather,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young\r\nmarquise. \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder whether your brother-in-law made them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery likely,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman; \xe2\x80\x9cif he did, you may be very sure they are\r\nwell made.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you must not be discouraged,\xe2\x80\x9d said M. de Bellegarde, with vague\r\nurbanity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to be. I have a project which gives me plenty to\r\nthink about, and that is an occupation.\xe2\x80\x9d And then Newman was silent a\r\nmoment, hesitating, yet thinking rapidly; he wished to make his point,\r\nand yet to do so forced him to speak out in a way that was disagreeable\r\nto him. Nevertheless he continued, addressing himself to old Madame de\r\nBellegarde, \xe2\x80\x9cI will tell you my project; perhaps you can help me. I\r\nwant to take a wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a very good project, but I am no matchmaker,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old lady.\r\n\r\nNewman looked at her an instant, and then, with perfect sincerity, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nshould have thought you were,\xe2\x80\x9d he declared.\r\n\r\nMadame de Bellegarde appeared to think him too sincere. She murmured\r\nsomething sharply in French, and fixed her eyes on her son. At this\r\nmoment the door of the room was thrown open, and with a rapid step\r\nValentin reappeared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have a message for you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to his sister-in-law. \xe2\x80\x9cClaire bids\r\nme to request you not to start for your ball. She will go with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClaire will go with us!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the young marquise. \xe2\x80\x9c_En voil\xc3\xa0, du\r\nnouveau!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has changed her mind; she decided half an hour ago, and she is\r\nsticking the last diamond into her hair,\xe2\x80\x9d said Valentin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat has taken possession of my daughter?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Madame de\r\nBellegarde, sternly. \xe2\x80\x9cShe has not been into the world these three\r\nyears. Does she take such a step at half an hour\xe2\x80\x99s notice, and without\r\nconsulting me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe consulted me, dear mother, five minutes since,\xe2\x80\x9d said Valentin,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand I told her that such a beautiful woman\xe2\x80\x94she is beautiful, you will\r\nsee\xe2\x80\x94had no right to bury herself alive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou should have referred Claire to her mother, my brother,\xe2\x80\x9d said M. de\r\nBellegarde, in French. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is very strange.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI refer her to the whole company!\xe2\x80\x9d said Valentin. \xe2\x80\x9cHere she comes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAnd he went to the open door, met Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 on the threshold,\r\ntook her by the hand, and led her into the room. She was dressed in\r\nwhite; but a long blue cloak, which hung almost to her feet, was\r\nfastened across her shoulders by a silver clasp. She had tossed it\r\nback, however, and her long white arms were uncovered. In her dense,\r\nfair hair there glittered a dozen diamonds. She looked serious and,\r\nNewman thought, rather pale; but she glanced round her, and, when she\r\nsaw him, smiled and put out her hand. He thought her tremendously\r\nhandsome. He had a chance to look at her full in the face, for she\r\nstood a moment in the centre of the room, hesitating, apparently, what\r\nshe should do, without meeting his eyes. Then she went up to her\r\nmother, who sat in her deep chair by the fire, looking at Madame de\r\nCintr\xc3\xa9 almost fiercely. With her back turned to the others, Madame de\r\nCintr\xc3\xa9 held her cloak apart to show her dress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think of me?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you are audacious,\xe2\x80\x9d said the marquise. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was but three days\r\nago, when I asked you, as a particular favor to myself, to go to the\r\nDuchess de Lusignan\xe2\x80\x99s, that you told me you were going nowhere and that\r\none must be consistent. Is this your consistency? Why should you\r\ndistinguish Madame Robineau? Who is it you wish to please to-night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish to please myself, dear mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9. And she\r\nbent over and kissed the old lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like surprises, my sister,\xe2\x80\x9d said Urbain de Bellegarde;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cespecially when one is on the point of entering a drawing-room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman at this juncture felt inspired to speak. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, if you are going\r\ninto a room with Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9, you needn\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid of being\r\nnoticed yourself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. de Bellegarde turned to his sister with a smile too intense to be\r\neasy. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope you appreciate a compliment that is paid you at your\r\nbrother\xe2\x80\x99s expense,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cCome, come, madame.\xe2\x80\x9d And offering Madame\r\nde Cintr\xc3\xa9 his arm he led her rapidly out of the room. Valentin rendered\r\nthe same service to young Madame de Bellegarde, who had apparently been\r\nreflecting on the fact that the ball-dress of her sister-in-law was\r\nmuch less brilliant than her own, and yet had failed to derive absolute\r\ncomfort from the reflection. With a farewell smile she sought the\r\ncomplement of her consolation in the eyes of the American visitor, and\r\nperceiving in them a certain mysterious brilliancy, it is not\r\nimprobable that she may have flattered herself she had found it.\r\n\r\nNewman, left alone with old Madame de Bellegarde, stood before her a\r\nfew moments in silence. \xe2\x80\x9cYour daughter is very beautiful,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at\r\nlast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is very strange,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de Bellegarde.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad to hear it,\xe2\x80\x9d Newman rejoined, smiling. \xe2\x80\x9cIt makes me hope.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHope what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat she will consent, some day, to marry me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old lady slowly rose to her feet. \xe2\x80\x9cThat really is your project,\r\nthen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; will you favor it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFavor it?\xe2\x80\x9d Madame de Bellegarde looked at him a moment and then shook\r\nher head. \xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, softly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you suffer it, then? Will you let it pass?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you ask. I am a very proud and meddlesome old\r\nwoman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I am very rich,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\nMadame de Bellegarde fixed her eyes on the floor, and Newman thought it\r\nprobable she was weighing the reasons in favor of resenting the\r\nbrutality of this remark. But at last, looking up, she said simply,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow rich?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman expressed his income in a round number which had the magnificent\r\nsound that large aggregations of dollars put on when they are\r\ntranslated into francs. He added a few remarks of a financial\r\ncharacter, which completed a sufficiently striking presentment of his\r\nresources.\r\n\r\nMadame de Bellegarde listened in silence. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are very frank,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid finally. \xe2\x80\x9cI will be the same. I would rather favor you, on the\r\nwhole, than suffer you. It will be easier.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am thankful for any terms,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, for the present, you\r\nhave suffered me long enough. Good night!\xe2\x80\x9d And he took his leave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n\r\nNewman, on his return to Paris, had not resumed the study of French\r\nconversation with M. Nioche; he found that he had too many other uses\r\nfor his time. M. Nioche, however, came to see him very promptly, having\r\nlearned his whereabouts by a mysterious process to which his patron\r\nnever obtained the key. The shrunken little capitalist repeated his\r\nvisit more than once. He seemed oppressed by a humiliating sense of\r\nhaving been overpaid, and wished apparently to redeem his debt by the\r\noffer of grammatical and statistical information in small installments.\r\nHe wore the same decently melancholy aspect as a few months before; a\r\nfew months more or less of brushing could make little difference in the\r\nantique lustre of his coat and hat. But the poor old man\xe2\x80\x99s spirit was a\r\ntrifle more threadbare; it seemed to have received some hard rubs\r\nduring the summer. Newman inquired with interest about Mademoiselle\r\nNo\xc3\xa9mie; and M. Nioche, at first, for answer, simply looked at him in\r\nlachrymose silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t ask me, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last. \xe2\x80\x9cI sit and watch her, but I can\r\ndo nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean that she misconducts herself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know, I am sure. I can\xe2\x80\x99t follow her. I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand her.\r\nShe has something in her head; I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what she is trying to do.\r\nShe is too deep for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes she continue to go to the Louvre? Has she made any of those\r\ncopies for me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe goes to the Louvre, but I see nothing of the copies. She has\r\nsomething on her easel; I suppose it is one of the pictures you\r\nordered. Such a magnificent order ought to give her fairy-fingers. But\r\nshe is not in earnest. I can\xe2\x80\x99t say anything to her; I am afraid of her.\r\nOne evening, last summer, when I took her to walk in the Champs\r\n\xc3\x89lys\xc3\xa9es, she said some things to me that frightened me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat were they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcuse an unhappy father from telling you,\xe2\x80\x9d said M. Nioche, unfolding\r\nhis calico pocket-handkerchief.\r\n\r\nNewman promised himself to pay Mademoiselle No\xc3\xa9mie another visit at the\r\nLouvre. He was curious about the progress of his copies, but it must be\r\nadded that he was still more curious about the progress of the young\r\nlady herself. He went one afternoon to the great museum, and wandered\r\nthrough several of the rooms in fruitless quest of her. He was bending\r\nhis steps to the long hall of the Italian masters, when suddenly he\r\nfound himself face to face with Valentin de Bellegarde. The young\r\nFrenchman greeted him with ardor, and assured him that he was a\r\ngodsend. He himself was in the worst of humors and he wanted someone to\r\ncontradict.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn a bad humor among all these beautiful things?\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nthought you were so fond of pictures, especially the old black ones.\r\nThere are two or three here that ought to keep you in spirits.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Valentin, \xe2\x80\x9cI am not in a mood for pictures, and\r\nthe more beautiful they are the less I like them. Their great staring\r\neyes and fixed positions irritate me. I feel as if I were at some big,\r\ndull party, in a room full of people I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wish to speak to. What\r\nshould I care for their beauty? It\xe2\x80\x99s a bore, and, worse still, it\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nreproach. I have a great many _ennuis_; I feel vicious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf the Louvre has so little comfort for you, why in the world did you\r\ncome here?\xe2\x80\x9d Newman asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is one of my _ennuis_. I came to meet my cousin\xe2\x80\x94a dreadful\r\nEnglish cousin, a member of my mother\xe2\x80\x99s family\xe2\x80\x94who is in Paris for a\r\nweek for her husband, and who wishes me to point out the \xe2\x80\x98principal\r\nbeauties.\xe2\x80\x99 Imagine a woman who wears a green crape bonnet in December\r\nand has straps sticking out of the ankles of her interminable boots! My\r\nmother begged I would do something to oblige them. I have undertaken to\r\nplay _valet de place_ this afternoon. They were to have met me here at\r\ntwo o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and I have been waiting for them twenty minutes. Why\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t she arrive? She has at least a pair of feet to carry her. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know whether to be furious at their playing me false, or\r\ndelighted to have escaped them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think in your place I would be furious,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause they\r\nmay arrive yet, and then your fury will still be of use to you. Whereas\r\nif you were delighted and they were afterwards to turn up, you might\r\nnot know what to do with your delight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou give me excellent advice, and I already feel better. I will be\r\nfurious; I will let them go to the deuce and I myself will go with\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x94unless by chance you too have a rendezvous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not exactly a rendezvous,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I have in fact come\r\nto see a person, not a picture.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA woman, presumably?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA young lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Valentin, \xe2\x80\x9cI hope for you with all my heart that she is\r\nnot clothed in green tulle and that her feet are not too much out of\r\nfocus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know much about her feet, but she has very pretty hands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nValentin gave a sigh. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd on that assurance I must part with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not certain of finding my young lady,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, \xe2\x80\x9cand I am not\r\nquite prepared to lose your company on the chance. It does not strike\r\nme as particularly desirable to introduce you to her, and yet I should\r\nrather like to have your opinion of her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs she pretty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI guess you will think so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBellegarde passed his arm into that of his companion. \xe2\x80\x9cConduct me to\r\nher on the instant! I should be ashamed to make a pretty woman wait for\r\nmy verdict.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman suffered himself to be gently propelled in the direction in\r\nwhich he had been walking, but his step was not rapid. He was turning\r\nsomething over in his mind. The two men passed into the long gallery of\r\nthe Italian masters, and Newman, after having scanned for a moment its\r\nbrilliant vista, turned aside into the smaller apartment devoted to the\r\nsame school, on the left. It contained very few persons, but at the\r\nfarther end of it sat Mademoiselle Nioche, before her easel. She was\r\nnot at work; her palette and brushes had been laid down beside her, her\r\nhands were folded in her lap, and she was leaning back in her chair and\r\nlooking intently at two ladies on the other side of the hall, who, with\r\ntheir backs turned to her, had stopped before one of the pictures.\r\nThese ladies were apparently persons of high fashion; they were dressed\r\nwith great splendor, and their long silken trains and furbelows were\r\nspread over the polished floor. It was at their dresses Mademoiselle\r\nNo\xc3\xa9mie was looking, though what she was thinking of I am unable to say.\r\nI hazard the supposition that she was saying to herself that to be able\r\nto drag such a train over a polished floor was a felicity worth any\r\nprice. Her reflections, at any rate, were disturbed by the advent of\r\nNewman and his companion. She glanced at them quickly, and then,\r\ncoloring a little, rose and stood before her easel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI came here on purpose to see you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman in his bad French,\r\noffering to shake hands. And then, like a good American, he introduced\r\nValentin formally: \xe2\x80\x9cAllow me to make you acquainted with the Comte\r\nValentin de Bellegarde.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nValentin made a bow which must have seemed to Mademoiselle No\xc3\xa9mie quite\r\nin harmony with the impressiveness of his title, but the graceful\r\nbrevity of her own response made no concession to underbred surprise.\r\nShe turned to Newman, putting up her hands to her hair and smoothing\r\nits delicately-felt roughness. Then, rapidly, she turned the canvas\r\nthat was on her easel over upon its face. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have not forgotten me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall never forget you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cYou may be sure of that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young girl, \xe2\x80\x9cthere are a great many different ways of\r\nremembering a person.\xe2\x80\x9d And she looked straight at Valentin de\r\nBellegarde, who was looking at her as a gentleman may when a \xe2\x80\x9cverdict\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nis expected of him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you painted anything for me?\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you been\r\nindustrious?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I have done nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d And taking up her palette, she began to mix\r\nher colors at hazard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut your father tells me you have come here constantly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have nowhere else to go! Here, all summer, it was cool, at least.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeing here, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, \xe2\x80\x9cyou might have tried something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told you before,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, softly, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to\r\npaint.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you have something charming on your easel, now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Valentin,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cif you would only let me see it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe spread out her two hands, with the fingers expanded, over the back\r\nof the canvas\xe2\x80\x94those hands which Newman had called pretty, and which, in\r\nspite of several paint-stains, Valentin could now admire. \xe2\x80\x9cMy painting\r\nis not charming,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the only thing about you that is not, then, mademoiselle,\xe2\x80\x9d quoth\r\nValentin, gallantly.\r\n\r\nShe took up her little canvas and silently passed it to him. He looked\r\nat it, and in a moment she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI am sure you are a judge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, \xe2\x80\x9cI am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know, then, that that is very bad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Mon Dieu_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Valentin, shrugging his shoulders \xe2\x80\x9clet us\r\ndistinguish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know that I ought not to attempt to paint,\xe2\x80\x9d the young girl\r\ncontinued.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrankly, then, mademoiselle, I think you ought not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe began to look at the dresses of the two splendid ladies again\xe2\x80\x94a\r\npoint on which, having risked one conjecture, I think I may risk\r\nanother. While she was looking at the ladies she was seeing Valentin de\r\nBellegarde. He, at all events, was seeing her. He put down the\r\nroughly-besmeared canvas and addressed a little click with his tongue,\r\naccompanied by an elevation of the eyebrows, to Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere have you been all these months?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mademoiselle No\xc3\xa9mie of\r\nour hero. \xe2\x80\x9cYou took those great journeys, you amused yourself well?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cI amused myself well enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very glad,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mademoiselle No\xc3\xa9mie with extreme gentleness, and\r\nshe began to dabble in her colors again. She was singularly pretty,\r\nwith the look of serious sympathy that she threw into her face.\r\n\r\nValentin took advantage of her downcast eyes to telegraph again to his\r\ncompanion. He renewed his mysterious physiognomical play, making at the\r\nsame time a rapid tremulous movement in the air with his fingers. He\r\nwas evidently finding Mademoiselle No\xc3\xa9mie extremely interesting; the\r\nblue devils had departed, leaving the field clear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me something about your travels,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the young girl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I went to Switzerland,\xe2\x80\x94to Geneva and Zermatt and Z\xc3\xbcrich and all\r\nthose places you know; and down to Venice, and all through Germany, and\r\ndown the Rhine, and into Holland and Belgium\xe2\x80\x94the regular round. How do\r\nyou say that, in French\xe2\x80\x94the regular round?\xe2\x80\x9d Newman asked of Valentin.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Nioche fixed her eyes an instant on Bellegarde, and then\r\nwith a little smile, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen he\r\nsays so much at once. Would you be so good as to translate?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would rather talk to you out of my own head,\xe2\x80\x9d Valentin declared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, gravely, still in his bad French, \xe2\x80\x9cyou must not talk\r\nto Mademoiselle Nioche, because you say discouraging things. You ought\r\nto tell her to work, to persevere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd we French, mademoiselle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Valentin, \xe2\x80\x9care accused of being\r\nfalse flatterers!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want any flattery, I want only the truth. But I know the\r\ntruth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll I say is that I suspect there are some things that you can do\r\nbetter than paint,\xe2\x80\x9d said Valentin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know the truth\xe2\x80\x94I know the truth,\xe2\x80\x9d Mademoiselle No\xc3\xa9mie repeated. And,\r\ndipping a brush into a clot of red paint, she drew a great horizontal\r\ndaub across her unfinished picture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is that?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Newman.\r\n\r\nWithout answering, she drew another long crimson daub, in a vertical\r\ndirection, down the middle of her canvas, and so, in a moment,\r\ncompleted the rough indication of a cross. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is the sign of the\r\ntruth,\xe2\x80\x9d she said at last.\r\n\r\nThe two men looked at each other, and Valentin indulged in another\r\nflash of physiognomical eloquence. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have spoiled your picture,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know that very well. It was the only thing to do with it. I had sat\r\nlooking at it all day without touching it. I had begun to hate it. It\r\nseemed to me something was going to happen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like it better that way than as it was before,\xe2\x80\x9d said Valentin. \xe2\x80\x9cNow\r\nit is more interesting. It tells a story. Is it for sale?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything I have is for sale,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mademoiselle No\xc3\xa9mie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much is this thing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTen thousand francs,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young girl, without a smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything that Mademoiselle Nioche may do at present is mine in\r\nadvance,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cIt makes part of an order I gave her some\r\nmonths ago. So you can\xe2\x80\x99t have this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur will lose nothing by it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young girl, looking at\r\nValentin. And she began to put up her utensils.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall have gained a charming memory,\xe2\x80\x9d said Valentin. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are going\r\naway? your day is over?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father is coming to fetch me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mademoiselle No\xc3\xa9mie.\r\n\r\nShe had hardly spoken when, through the door behind her, which opens on\r\none of the great white stone staircases of the Louvre, M. Nioche made\r\nhis appearance. He came in with his usual even, patient shuffle, and he\r\nmade a low salute to the two gentlemen who were standing before his\r\ndaughter\xe2\x80\x99s easel. Newman shook his hands with muscular friendliness,\r\nand Valentin returned his greeting with extreme deference. While the\r\nold man stood waiting for No\xc3\xa9mie to make a parcel of her implements, he\r\nlet his mild, oblique gaze hover toward Bellegarde, who was watching\r\nMademoiselle No\xc3\xa9mie put on her bonnet and mantle. Valentin was at no\r\npains to disguise his scrutiny. He looked at a pretty girl as he would\r\nhave listened to a piece of music. Attention, in each case, was simple\r\ngood manners. M. Nioche at last took his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s paint-box in one\r\nhand and the bedaubed canvas, after giving it a solemn, puzzled stare,\r\nin the other, and led the way to the door. Mademoiselle No\xc3\xa9mie made the\r\nyoung men the salute of a duchess, and followed her father.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat do you think of her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is very remarkable. _Diable, diable, diable!_\xe2\x80\x9d repeated M. de\r\nBellegarde, reflectively; \xe2\x80\x9cshe is very remarkable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid she is a sad little adventuress,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a little one\xe2\x80\x94a great one. She has the material.\xe2\x80\x9d And Valentin\r\nbegan to walk away slowly, looking vaguely at the pictures on the\r\nwalls, with a thoughtful illumination in his eye. Nothing could have\r\nappealed to his imagination more than the possible adventures of a\r\nyoung lady endowed with the \xe2\x80\x9cmaterial\xe2\x80\x9d of Mademoiselle Nioche. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is\r\nvery interesting,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is a beautiful type.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA beautiful type? What the deuce do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean from the artistic point of view. She is an artist,\xe2\x80\x94outside of\r\nher painting, which obviously is execrable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut she is not beautiful. I don\xe2\x80\x99t even think her very pretty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is quite pretty enough for her purposes, and it is a face and\r\nfigure on which everything tells. If she were prettier she would be\r\nless intelligent, and her intelligence is half of her charm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn what way,\xe2\x80\x9d asked Newman, who was much amused at his companion\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nimmediate philosophisation of Mademoiselle Nioche, \xe2\x80\x9cdoes her\r\nintelligence strike you as so remarkable?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has taken the measure of life, and she has determined to _be_\r\nsomething\xe2\x80\x94to succeed at any cost. Her painting, of course, is a mere\r\ntrick to gain time. She is waiting for her chance; she wishes to launch\r\nherself, and to do it well. She knows her Paris. She is one of fifty\r\nthousand, so far as the mere ambition goes; but I am very sure that in\r\nthe way of resolution and capacity she is a rarity. And in one\r\ngift\xe2\x80\x94perfect heartlessness\xe2\x80\x94I will warrant she is unsurpassed. She has\r\nnot as much heart as will go on the point of a needle. That is an\r\nimmense virtue. Yes, she is one of the celebrities of the future.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeaven help us!\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, \xe2\x80\x9chow far the artistic point of view may\r\ntake a man! But in this case I must request that you don\xe2\x80\x99t let it take\r\nyou too far. You have learned a wonderful deal about Mademoiselle\r\nNo\xc3\xa9mie in a quarter of an hour. Let that suffice; don\xe2\x80\x99t follow up your\r\nresearches.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Bellegarde with warmth, \xe2\x80\x9cI hope I have too good\r\nmanners to intrude.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not intruding. The girl is nothing to me. In fact, I rather\r\ndislike her. But I like her poor old father, and for his sake I beg you\r\nto abstain from any attempt to verify your theories.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the sake of that seedy old gentleman who came to fetch her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ndemanded Valentin, stopping short. And on Newman\xe2\x80\x99s assenting, \xe2\x80\x9cAh no,\r\nah no,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on with a smile. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are quite wrong, my dear fellow;\r\nyou needn\xe2\x80\x99t mind him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI verily believe that you are accusing the poor gentleman of being\r\ncapable of rejoicing in his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s dishonor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Voyons!_\xe2\x80\x9d said Valentin; \xe2\x80\x9cwho is he? what is he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is what he looks like: as poor as a rat, but very high-toned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly. I noticed him perfectly; be sure I do him justice. He has had\r\nlosses, _des malheurs_, as we say. He is very low-spirited, and his\r\ndaughter is too much for him. He is the pink of respectability, and he\r\nhas sixty years of honesty on his back. All this I perfectly\r\nappreciate. But I know my fellow-men and my fellow-Parisians, and I\r\nwill make a bargain with you.\xe2\x80\x9d Newman gave ear to his bargain and he\r\nwent on. \xe2\x80\x9cHe would rather his daughter were a good girl than a bad one,\r\nbut if the worst comes to the worst, the old man will not do what\r\nVirginius did. Success justifies everything. If Mademoiselle No\xc3\xa9mie\r\nmakes a figure, her papa will feel\xe2\x80\x94well, we will call it relieved. And\r\nshe will make a figure. The old gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s future is assured.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what Virginius did, but M. Nioche will shoot Miss\r\nNo\xc3\xa9mie,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter that, I suppose his future will be assured\r\nin some snug prison.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not a cynic; I am simply an observer,\xe2\x80\x9d Valentin rejoined.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMademoiselle No\xc3\xa9mie interests me; she is extremely remarkable. If\r\nthere is a good reason, in honor or decency, for dismissing her from my\r\nthoughts forever, I am perfectly willing to do it. Your estimate of the\r\npapa\xe2\x80\x99s sensibilities is a good reason until it is invalidated. I\r\npromise you not to look at the young girl again until you tell me that\r\nyou have changed your mind about the papa. When he has given distinct\r\nproof of being a philosopher, you will raise your interdict. Do you\r\nagree to that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean to bribe him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you admit, then, that he is bribable? No, he would ask too much,\r\nand it would not be exactly fair. I mean simply to wait. You will\r\ncontinue, I suppose, to see this interesting couple, and you will give\r\nme the news yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, \xe2\x80\x9cif the old man turns out a humbug, you may do\r\nwhat you please. I wash my hands of the matter. For the girl herself,\r\nyou may be at rest. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what harm she may do to me, but I\r\ncertainly can\xe2\x80\x99t hurt her. It seems to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you are\r\nvery well matched. You are both hard cases, and M. Nioche and I, I\r\nbelieve, are the only virtuous men to be found in Paris.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSoon after this M. de Bellegarde, in punishment for his levity,\r\nreceived a stern poke in the back from a pointed instrument. Turning\r\nquickly round he found the weapon to be a parasol wielded by a lady in\r\ngreen gauze bonnet. Valentin\xe2\x80\x99s English cousins had been drifting about\r\nunpiloted, and evidently deemed that they had a grievance. Newman left\r\nhim to their mercies, but with a boundless faith in his power to plead\r\nhis cause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n\r\nThree days after his introduction to the family of Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9,\r\nNewman, coming in toward evening, found upon his table the card of the\r\nMarquis de Bellegarde. On the following day he received a note\r\ninforming him that the Marquise de Bellegarde would be grateful for the\r\nhonor of his company at dinner.\r\n\r\nHe went, of course, though he had to break another engagement to do it.\r\nHe was ushered into the room in which Madame de Bellegarde had received\r\nhim before, and here he found his venerable hostess, surrounded by her\r\nentire family. The room was lighted only by the crackling fire, which\r\nilluminated the very small pink slippers of a lady who, seated in a low\r\nchair, was stretching out her toes before it. This lady was the younger\r\nMadame de Bellegarde. Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 was seated at the other end of\r\nthe room, holding a little girl against her knee, the child of her\r\nbrother Urbain, to whom she was apparently relating a wonderful story.\r\nValentin was sitting on a puff, close to his sister-in-law, into whose\r\near he was certainly distilling the finest nonsense. The marquis was\r\nstationed before the fire, with his head erect and his hands behind\r\nhim, in an attitude of formal expectancy.\r\n\r\nOld Madame de Bellegarde stood up to give Newman her greeting, and\r\nthere was that in the way she did so which seemed to measure narrowly\r\nthe extent of her condescension. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are all alone, you see, we have\r\nasked no one else,\xe2\x80\x9d she said austerely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very glad you didn\xe2\x80\x99t; this is much more sociable,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood evening, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d and he offered his hand to the marquis.\r\n\r\nM. de Bellegarde was affable, but in spite of his dignity he was\r\nrestless. He began to pace up and down the room, he looked out of the\r\nlong windows, he took up books and laid them down again. Young Madame\r\nde Bellegarde gave Newman her hand without moving and without looking\r\nat him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may think that is coldness,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Valentin; \xe2\x80\x9cbut it is not,\r\nit is warmth. It shows she is treating you as an intimate. Now she\r\ndetests me, and yet she is always looking at me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo wonder I detest you if I am always looking at you!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the lady.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf Mr. Newman does not like my way of shaking hands, I will do it\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut this charming privilege was lost upon our hero, who was already\r\nmaking his way across the room to Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9. She looked at him\r\nas she shook hands, but she went on with the story she was telling her\r\nlittle niece. She had only two or three phrases to add, but they were\r\napparently of great moment. She deepened her voice, smiling as she did\r\nso, and the little girl gazed at her with round eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut in the end the young prince married the beautiful Florabella,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9, \xe2\x80\x9cand carried her off to live with him in the\r\nLand of the Pink Sky. There she was so happy that she forgot all her\r\ntroubles, and went out to drive every day of her life in an ivory coach\r\ndrawn by five hundred white mice. Poor Florabella,\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed to\r\nNewman, \xe2\x80\x9chad suffered terribly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe had had nothing to eat for six months,\xe2\x80\x9d said little Blanche.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but when the six months were over, she had a plum-cake as big as\r\nthat ottoman,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9. \xe2\x80\x9cThat quite set her up again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a checkered career!\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you very fond of\r\nchildren?\xe2\x80\x9d He was certain that she was, but he wished to make her say\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like to talk with them,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered; \xe2\x80\x9cwe can talk with them so\r\nmuch more seriously than with grown persons. That is great nonsense\r\nthat I have been telling Blanche, but it is a great deal more serious\r\nthan most of what we say in society.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you would talk to me, then, as if I were Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s age,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nNewman, laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cWere you happy at your ball the other night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEcstatically!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow you are talking the nonsense that we talk in society,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nNewman. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was my own fault if I was not happy. The ball was very pretty, and\r\neveryone very amiable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was on your conscience,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you had annoyed your\r\nmother and your brother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 looked at him a moment without answering. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is\r\ntrue,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied at last. \xe2\x80\x9cI had undertaken more than I could carry\r\nout. I have very little courage; I am not a heroine.\xe2\x80\x9d She said this\r\nwith a certain soft emphasis; but then, changing her tone, \xe2\x80\x9cI could\r\nnever have gone through the sufferings of the beautiful Florabella,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe added, not even for her prospective rewards.\r\n\r\nDinner was announced, and Newman betook himself to the side of the old\r\nMadame de Bellegarde. The dining-room, at the end of a cold corridor,\r\nwas vast and sombre; the dinner was simple and delicately excellent.\r\nNewman wondered whether Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 had had something to do with\r\nordering the repast and greatly hoped she had. Once seated at table,\r\nwith the various members of the ancient house of Bellegarde around him,\r\nhe asked himself the meaning of his position. Was the old lady\r\nresponding to his advances? Did the fact that he was a solitary guest\r\naugment his credit or diminish it? Were they ashamed to show him to\r\nother people, or did they wish to give him a sign of sudden adoption\r\ninto their last reserve of favor? Newman was on his guard; he was\r\nwatchful and conjectural; and yet at the same time he was vaguely\r\nindifferent. Whether they gave him a long rope or a short one he was\r\nthere now, and Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 was opposite to him. She had a tall\r\ncandlestick on each side of her; she would sit there for the next hour,\r\nand that was enough. The dinner was extremely solemn and measured; he\r\nwondered whether this was always the state of things in \xe2\x80\x9cold families.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nMadame de Bellegarde held her head very high, and fixed her eyes, which\r\nlooked peculiarly sharp in her little, finely-wrinkled white face, very\r\nintently upon the table-service. The marquis appeared to have decided\r\nthat the fine arts offered a safe subject of conversation, as not\r\nleading to startling personal revelations. Every now and then, having\r\nlearned from Newman that he had been through the museums of Europe, he\r\nuttered some polished aphorism upon the flesh-tints of Rubens and the\r\ngood taste of Sansovino. His manners seemed to indicate a fine, nervous\r\ndread that something disagreeable might happen if the atmosphere were\r\nnot purified by allusions of a thoroughly superior cast. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat under\r\nthe sun is the man afraid of?\xe2\x80\x9d Newman asked himself. \xe2\x80\x9cDoes he think I\r\nam going to offer to swap jack-knives with him?\xe2\x80\x9d It was useless to shut\r\nhis eyes to the fact that the marquis was profoundly disagreeable to\r\nhim. He had never been a man of strong personal aversions; his nerves\r\nhad not been at the mercy of the mystical qualities of his neighbors.\r\nBut here was a man towards whom he was irresistibly in opposition; a\r\nman of forms and phrases and postures; a man full of possible\r\nimpertinences and treacheries. M. de Bellegarde made him feel as if he\r\nwere standing bare-footed on a marble floor; and yet, to gain his\r\ndesire, Newman felt perfectly able to stand. He wondered what Madame de\r\nCintr\xc3\xa9 thought of his being accepted, if accepted it was. There was no\r\njudging from her face, which expressed simply the desire to be gracious\r\nin a manner which should require as little explicit recognition as\r\npossible. Young Madame de Bellegarde had always the same manners; she\r\nwas always preoccupied, distracted, listening to everything and hearing\r\nnothing, looking at her dress, her rings, her finger-nails, seeming\r\nrather bored, and yet puzzling you to decide what was her ideal of\r\nsocial diversion. Newman was enlightened on this point later. Even\r\nValentin did not quite seem master of his wits; his vivacity was fitful\r\nand forced, yet Newman observed that in the lapses of his talk he\r\nappeared excited. His eyes had an intenser spark than usual. The effect\r\nof all this was that Newman, for the first time in his life, was not\r\nhimself; that he measured his movements, and counted his words, and\r\nresolved that if the occasion demanded that he should appear to have\r\nswallowed a ramrod, he would meet the emergency.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner M. de Bellegarde proposed to his guest that they should go\r\ninto the smoking-room, and he led the way toward a small, somewhat\r\nmusty apartment, the walls of which were ornamented with old hangings\r\nof stamped leather and trophies of rusty arms. Newman refused a cigar,\r\nbut he established himself upon one of the divans, while the marquis\r\npuffed his own weed before the fire-place, and Valentin sat looking\r\nthrough the light fumes of a cigarette from one to the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t keep quiet any longer,\xe2\x80\x9d said Valentin, at last. \xe2\x80\x9cI must tell\r\nyou the news and congratulate you. My brother seems unable to come to\r\nthe point; he revolves around his announcement like the priest around\r\nthe altar. You are accepted as a candidate for the hand of our sister.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cValentin, be a little proper!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the marquis, with a look of\r\nthe most delicate irritation contracting the bridge of his high nose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere has been a family council,\xe2\x80\x9d the young man continued; \xe2\x80\x9cmy mother\r\nand Urbain have put their heads together, and even my testimony has not\r\nbeen altogether excluded. My mother and the marquis sat at a table\r\ncovered with green cloth; my sister-in-law and I were on a bench\r\nagainst the wall. It was like a committee at the Corps L\xc3\xa9gislatif. We\r\nwere called up, one after the other, to testify. We spoke of you very\r\nhandsomely. Madame de Bellegarde said that if she had not been told who\r\nyou were, she would have taken you for a duke\xe2\x80\x94an American duke, the\r\nDuke of California. I said that I could warrant you grateful for the\r\nsmallest favors\xe2\x80\x94modest, humble, unassuming. I was sure that you would\r\nknow your own place, always, and never give us occasion to remind you\r\nof certain differences. After all, you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help it if you were not\r\na duke. There were none in your country; but if there had been, it was\r\ncertain that, smart and active as you are, you would have got the pick\r\nof the titles. At this point I was ordered to sit down, but I think I\r\nmade an impression in your favor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. de Bellegarde looked at his brother with dangerous coldness, and\r\ngave a smile as thin as the edge of a knife. Then he removed a spark of\r\ncigar-ash from the sleeve of his coat; he fixed his eyes for a while on\r\nthe cornice of the room, and at last he inserted one of his white hands\r\ninto the breast of his waistcoat. \xe2\x80\x9cI must apologize to you for the\r\ndeplorable levity of my brother,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand I must notify you that\r\nthis is probably not the last time that his want of tact will cause you\r\nserious embarrassment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I confess I have no tact,\xe2\x80\x9d said Valentin. \xe2\x80\x9cIs your embarrassment\r\nreally painful, Newman? The marquis will put you right again; his own\r\ntouch is deliciously delicate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cValentin, I am sorry to say,\xe2\x80\x9d the marquis continued, \xe2\x80\x9chas never\r\npossessed the tone, the manner, that belongs to a young man in his\r\nposition. It has been a great affliction to his mother, who is very\r\nfond of the old traditions. But you must remember that he speaks for no\r\none but himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind him, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, good-humoredly. \xe2\x80\x9cI know what\r\nhe amounts to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the good old times,\xe2\x80\x9d said Valentin, \xe2\x80\x9cmarquises and counts used to\r\nhave their appointed fools and jesters, to crack jokes for them.\r\nNowadays we see a great strapping democrat keeping a count about him to\r\nplay the fool. It\xe2\x80\x99s a good situation, but I certainly am very\r\ndegenerate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. de Bellegarde fixed his eyes for some time on the floor. \xe2\x80\x9cMy mother\r\ninformed me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said presently, \xe2\x80\x9cof the announcement that you made to\r\nher the other evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I desired to marry your sister?\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat you wished to arrange a marriage,\xe2\x80\x9d said the marquis, slowly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwith my sister, the Comtesse de Cintr\xc3\xa9. The proposal was serious, and\r\nrequired, on my mother\xe2\x80\x99s part, a great deal of reflection. She\r\nnaturally took me into her counsels, and I gave my most zealous\r\nattention to the subject. There was a great deal to be considered; more\r\nthan you appear to imagine. We have viewed the question on all its\r\nfaces, we have weighed one thing against another. Our conclusion has\r\nbeen that we favor your suit. My mother has desired me to inform you of\r\nour decision. She will have the honor of saying a few words to you on\r\nthe subject herself. Meanwhile, by us, the heads of the family, you are\r\naccepted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman got up and came nearer to the marquis. \xe2\x80\x9cYou will do nothing to\r\nhinder me, and all you can to help me, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will recommend my sister to accept you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman passed his hand over his face, and pressed it for a moment upon\r\nhis eyes. This promise had a great sound, and yet the pleasure he took\r\nin it was embittered by his having to stand there so and receive his\r\npassport from M. de Bellegarde. The idea of having this gentleman mixed\r\nup with his wooing and wedding was more and more disagreeable to him.\r\nBut Newman had resolved to go through the mill, as he imagined it, and\r\nhe would not cry out at the first turn of the wheel. He was silent a\r\nwhile, and then he said, with a certain dryness which Valentin told him\r\nafterwards had a very grand air, \xe2\x80\x9cI am much obliged to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI take note of the promise,\xe2\x80\x9d said Valentin, \xe2\x80\x9cI register the vow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. de Bellegarde began to gaze at the cornice again; he apparently had\r\nsomething more to say. \xe2\x80\x9cI must do my mother the justice,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must do myself the justice, to say that our decision was not easy.\r\nSuch an arrangement was not what we had expected. The idea that my\r\nsister should marry a gentleman\xe2\x80\x94ah\xe2\x80\x94in business was something of a\r\nnovelty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I told you, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Valentin raising his finger at Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe novelty has not quite worn away, I confess,\xe2\x80\x9d the marquis went on;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cperhaps it never will, entirely. But possibly that is not altogether\r\nto be regretted,\xe2\x80\x9d and he gave his thin smile again. \xe2\x80\x9cIt may be that the\r\ntime has come when we should make some concession to novelty. There had\r\nbeen no novelties in our house for a great many years. I made the\r\nobservation to my mother, and she did me the honor to admit that it was\r\nworthy of attention.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear brother,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Valentin, \xe2\x80\x9cis not your memory just here\r\nleading you the least bit astray? Our mother is, I may say,\r\ndistinguished for her small respect of abstract reasoning. Are you very\r\nsure that she replied to your striking proposition in the gracious\r\nmanner you describe? You know how terribly incisive she is sometimes.\r\nDidn\xe2\x80\x99t she, rather, do you the honor to say, \xe2\x80\x98A fiddlestick for your\r\nphrases! There are better reasons than that?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOther reasons were discussed,\xe2\x80\x9d said the marquis, without looking at\r\nValentin, but with an audible tremor in his voice; \xe2\x80\x9csome of them\r\npossibly were better. We are conservative, Mr. Newman, but we are not\r\nalso bigots. We judged the matter liberally. We have no doubt that\r\neverything will be comfortable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman had stood listening to these remarks with his arms folded and\r\nhis eyes fastened upon M. de Bellegarde, \xe2\x80\x9cComfortable?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with a\r\nsort of grim flatness of intonation. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we be comfortable?\r\nIf you are not, it will be your own fault; I have everything to make\r\n_me_ so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy brother means that with the lapse of time you may get used to the\r\nchange\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and Valentin paused, to light another cigarette.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat change?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Newman in the same tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUrbain,\xe2\x80\x9d said Valentin, very gravely, \xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid that Mr. Newman\r\ndoes not quite realize the change. We ought to insist upon that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy brother goes too far,\xe2\x80\x9d said M. de Bellegarde. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is his fatal want\r\nof tact again. It is my mother\xe2\x80\x99s wish, and mine, that no such allusions\r\nshould be made. Pray never make them yourself. We prefer to assume that\r\nthe person accepted as the possible husband of my sister is one of\r\nourselves, and that he should have no explanations to make. With a\r\nlittle discretion on both sides, everything, I think, will be easy.\r\nThat is exactly what I wished to say\xe2\x80\x94that we quite understand what we\r\nhave undertaken, and that you may depend upon our adhering to our\r\nresolution.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nValentin shook his hands in the air and then buried his face in them.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have less tact than I might have, no doubt; but oh, my brother, if\r\nyou knew what you yourself were saying!\xe2\x80\x9d And he went off into a long\r\nlaugh.\r\n\r\nM. de Bellegarde\xe2\x80\x99s face flushed a little, but he held his head higher,\r\nas if to repudiate this concession to vulgar perturbability. \xe2\x80\x9cI am sure\r\nyou understand me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand you at all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you needn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmind that. I don\xe2\x80\x99t care. In fact, I think I had better not understand\r\nyou. I might not like it. That wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t suit me at all, you know. I\r\nwant to marry your sister, that\xe2\x80\x99s all; to do it as quickly as possible,\r\nand to find fault with nothing. I don\xe2\x80\x99t care how I do it. I am not\r\nmarrying you, you know, sir. I have got my leave, and that is all I\r\nwant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had better receive the last word from my mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nmarquis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good; I will go and get it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman; and he prepared to\r\nreturn to the drawing-room.\r\n\r\nM. de Bellegarde made a motion for him to pass first, and when Newman\r\nhad gone out he shut himself into the room with Valentin. Newman had\r\nbeen a trifle bewildered by the audacious irony of the younger brother,\r\nand he had not needed its aid to point the moral of M. de Bellegarde\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntranscendent patronage. He had wit enough to appreciate the force of\r\nthat civility which consists in calling your attention to the\r\nimpertinences it spares you. But he had felt warmly the delicate\r\nsympathy with himself that underlay Valentin\xe2\x80\x99s fraternal irreverence,\r\nand he was most unwilling that his friend should pay a tax upon it. He\r\npaused a moment in the corridor, after he had gone a few steps,\r\nexpecting to hear the resonance of M. de Bellegarde\xe2\x80\x99s displeasure; but\r\nhe detected only a perfect stillness. The stillness itself seemed a\r\ntrifle portentous; he reflected however that he had no right to stand\r\nlistening, and he made his way back to the salon. In his absence\r\nseveral persons had come in. They were scattered about the room in\r\ngroups, two or three of them having passed into a small boudoir, next\r\nto the drawing-room, which had now been lighted and opened. Old Madame\r\nde Bellegarde was in her place by the fire, talking to a very old\r\ngentleman in a wig and a profuse white neck cloth of the fashion of\r\n1820. Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 was bending a listening head to the historic\r\nconfidences of an old lady who was presumably the wife of the old\r\ngentleman in the neckcloth, an old lady in a red satin dress and an\r\nermine cape, who wore across her forehead a band with a topaz set in\r\nit. Young Madame de Bellegarde, when Newman came in, left some people\r\namong whom she was sitting, and took the place that she had occupied\r\nbefore dinner. Then she gave a little push to the puff that stood near\r\nher, and by a glance at Newman seemed to indicate that she had placed\r\nit in position for him. He went and took possession of it; the\r\nmarquis\xe2\x80\x99s wife amused and puzzled him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know your secret,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in her bad but charming English; \xe2\x80\x9cyou\r\nneed make no mystery of it. You wish to marry my sister-in-law. _C\xe2\x80\x99est\r\nun beau choix_. A man like you ought to marry a tall, thin woman. You\r\nmust know that I have spoken in your favor; you owe me a famous taper!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have spoken to Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9?\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, not that. You may think it strange, but my sister-in-law and I\r\nare not so intimate as that. No; I spoke to my husband and my\r\nmother-in-law; I said I was sure we could do what we chose with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am much obliged to you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, laughing; \xe2\x80\x9cbut you can\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know that very well; I didn\xe2\x80\x99t believe a word of it. But I wanted you\r\nto come into the house; I thought we should be friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very sure of it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be too sure. If you like Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 so much, perhaps you\r\nwill not like me. We are as different as blue and pink. But you and I\r\nhave something in common. I have come into this family by marriage; you\r\nwant to come into it in the same way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, I don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cI only want to take Madame de\r\nCintr\xc3\xa9 out of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, to cast your nets you have to go into the water. Our positions\r\nare alike; we shall be able to compare notes. What do you think of my\r\nhusband? It\xe2\x80\x99s a strange question, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? But I shall ask you some\r\nstranger ones yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps a stranger one will be easier to answer,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nmight try me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you get off very well; the old Comte de la Rochefid\xc3\xa8le, yonder,\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do it better. I told them that if we only gave you a chance\r\nyou would be a perfect _talon rouge_. I know something about men.\r\nBesides, you and I belong to the same camp. I am a ferocious democrat.\r\nBy birth I am _vieille roche_; a good little bit of the history of\r\nFrance is the history of my family. Oh, you never heard of us, of\r\ncourse! _Ce que c\xe2\x80\x99est que la gloire!_ We are much better than the\r\nBellegardes, at any rate. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t care a pin for my pedigree; I\r\nwant to belong to my time. I\xe2\x80\x99m a revolutionist, a radical, a child of\r\nthe age! I am sure I go beyond you. I like clever people, wherever they\r\ncome from, and I take my amusement wherever I find it. I don\xe2\x80\x99t pout at\r\nthe Empire; here all the world pouts at the Empire. Of course I have to\r\nmind what I say; but I expect to take my revenge with you.\xe2\x80\x9d Madame de\r\nBellegarde discoursed for some time longer in this sympathetic strain,\r\nwith an eager abundance which seemed to indicate that her opportunities\r\nfor revealing her esoteric philosophy were indeed rare. She hoped that\r\nNewman would never be afraid of her, however he might be with the\r\nothers, for, really, she went very far indeed. \xe2\x80\x9cStrong people\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94_le gens\r\nforts_\xe2\x80\x94were in her opinion equal, all the world over. Newman listened\r\nto her with an attention at once beguiled and irritated. He wondered\r\nwhat the deuce she, too, was driving at, with her hope that he would\r\nnot be afraid of her and her protestations of equality. In so far as he\r\ncould understand her, she was wrong; a silly, rattling woman was\r\ncertainly not the equal of a sensible man, preoccupied with an\r\nambitious passion. Madame de Bellegarde stopped suddenly, and looked at\r\nhim sharply, shaking her fan. \xe2\x80\x9cI see you don\xe2\x80\x99t believe me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou are too much on your guard. You will not form an alliance,\r\noffensive or defensive? You are very wrong; I could help you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman answered that he was very grateful and that he would certainly\r\nask for help; she should see. \xe2\x80\x9cBut first of all,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI must help\r\nmyself.\xe2\x80\x9d And he went to join Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been telling Madame de la Rochefid\xc3\xa8le that you are an\r\nAmerican,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, as he came up. \xe2\x80\x9cIt interests her greatly. Her\r\nfather went over with the French troops to help you in your battles in\r\nthe last century, and she has always, in consequence, wanted greatly to\r\nsee an American. But she has never succeeded till to-night. You are the\r\nfirst\xe2\x80\x94to her knowledge\xe2\x80\x94that she has ever looked at.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame de la Rochefid\xc3\xa8le had an aged, cadaverous face, with a falling\r\nof the lower jaw which prevented her from bringing her lips together,\r\nand reduced her conversations to a series of impressive but\r\ninarticulate gutturals. She raised an antique eyeglass, elaborately\r\nmounted in chased silver, and looked at Newman from head to foot. Then\r\nshe said something to which he listened deferentially, but which he\r\ncompletely failed to understand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadame de la Rochefid\xc3\xa8le says that she is convinced that she must have\r\nseen Americans without knowing it,\xe2\x80\x9d Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 explained. Newman\r\nthought it probable she had seen a great many things without knowing\r\nit; and the old lady, again addressing herself to utterance,\r\ndeclared\xe2\x80\x94as interpreted by Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x94that she wished she had\r\nknown it.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the old gentleman who had been talking to the elder\r\nMadame de Bellegarde drew near, leading the marquise on his arm. His\r\nwife pointed out Newman to him, apparently explaining his remarkable\r\norigin. M. de la Rochefid\xc3\xa8le, whose old age was rosy and rotund, spoke\r\nvery neatly and clearly, almost as prettily, Newman thought, as M.\r\nNioche. When he had been enlightened, he turned to Newman with an\r\ninimitable elderly grace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur is by no means the first American that I have seen,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlmost the first person I ever saw\xe2\x80\x94to notice him\xe2\x80\x94was an American.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh?\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, sympathetically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe great Dr. Franklin,\xe2\x80\x9d said M. de la Rochefid\xc3\xa8le. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course I was\r\nvery young. He was received very well in our _monde._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot better than Mr. Newman,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de Bellegarde. \xe2\x80\x9cI beg he will\r\noffer his arm into the other room. I could have offered no higher\r\nprivilege to Dr. Franklin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman, complying with Madame de Bellegarde\xe2\x80\x99s request, perceived that\r\nher two sons had returned to the drawing-room. He scanned their faces\r\nan instant for traces of the scene that had followed his separation\r\nfrom them, but the marquis seemed neither more nor less frigidly grand\r\nthan usual, and Valentin was kissing ladies\xe2\x80\x99 hands with at least his\r\nhabitual air of self-abandonment to the act. Madame de Bellegarde gave\r\na glance at her eldest son, and by the time she had crossed the\r\nthreshold of her boudoir he was at her side. The room was now empty and\r\noffered a sufficient degree of privacy. The old lady disengaged herself\r\nfrom Newman\xe2\x80\x99s arm and rested her hand on the arm of the marquis; and in\r\nthis position she stood a moment, holding her head high and biting her\r\nsmall under-lip. I am afraid the picture was lost upon Newman, but\r\nMadame de Bellegarde was, in fact, at this moment a striking image of\r\nthe dignity which\xe2\x80\x94even in the case of a little time-shrunken old\r\nlady\xe2\x80\x94may reside in the habit of unquestioned authority and the\r\nabsoluteness of a social theory favorable to yourself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy son has spoken to you as I desired,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cand you understand\r\nthat we shall not interfere. The rest will lie with yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cM. de Bellegarde told me several things I didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nNewman, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I made out that. You will leave me open field. I am much\r\nobliged.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish to add a word that my son probably did not feel at liberty to\r\nsay,\xe2\x80\x9d the marquise rejoined. \xe2\x80\x9cI must say it for my own peace of mind.\r\nWe are stretching a point; we are doing you a great favor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, your son said it very well; didn\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot so well as my mother,\xe2\x80\x9d declared the marquis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can only repeat\xe2\x80\x94I am much obliged.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is proper I should tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d Madame de Bellegarde went on, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I\r\nam very proud, and that I hold my head very high. I may be wrong, but I\r\nam too old to change. At least I know it, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t pretend to\r\nanything else. Don\xe2\x80\x99t flatter yourself that my daughter is not proud.\r\nShe is proud in her own way\xe2\x80\x94a somewhat different way from mine. You\r\nwill have to make your terms with that. Even Valentin is proud, if you\r\ntouch the right spot\xe2\x80\x94or the wrong one. Urbain is proud; that you see\r\nfor yourself. Sometimes I think he is a little too proud; but I\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t change him. He is the best of my children; he cleaves to his\r\nold mother. But I have said enough to show you that we are all proud\r\ntogether. It is well that you should know the sort of people you have\r\ncome among.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, \xe2\x80\x9cI can only say, in return, that I am _not_ proud;\r\nI shan\xe2\x80\x99t mind you! But you speak as if you intended to be very\r\ndisagreeable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall not enjoy having my daughter marry you, and I shall not\r\npretend to enjoy it. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind that, so much the better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you stick to your own side of the contract we shall not quarrel;\r\nthat is all I ask of you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cKeep your hands off, and give\r\nme an open field. I am very much in earnest, and there is not the\r\nslightest danger of my getting discouraged or backing out. You will\r\nhave me constantly before your eyes; if you don\xe2\x80\x99t like it, I am sorry\r\nfor you. I will do for your daughter, if she will accept me, everything\r\nthat a man can do for a woman. I am happy to tell you that, as a\r\npromise\xe2\x80\x94a pledge. I consider that on your side you make me an equal\r\npledge. You will not back out, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you mean by \xe2\x80\x98backing out,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d said the marquise. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nsuggests a movement of which I think no Bellegarde has ever been\r\nguilty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur word is our word,\xe2\x80\x9d said Urbain. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have given it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, \xe2\x80\x9cI am very glad you are so proud. It makes me\r\nbelieve that you will keep it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe marquise was silent a moment, and then, suddenly, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall always\r\nbe polite to you, Mr. Newman,\xe2\x80\x9d she declared, \xe2\x80\x9cbut, decidedly, I shall\r\nnever like you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be too sure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am so sure that I will ask you to take me back to my armchair\r\nwithout the least fear of having my sentiments modified by the service\r\nyou render me.\xe2\x80\x9d And Madame de Bellegarde took his arm, and returned to\r\nthe salon and to her customary place.\r\n\r\nM. de la Rochefid\xc3\xa8le and his wife were preparing to take their leave,\r\nand Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s interview with the mumbling old lady was at an\r\nend. She stood looking about her, asking herself, apparently to whom\r\nshe should next speak, when Newman came up to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour mother has given me leave\xe2\x80\x94very solemnly\xe2\x80\x94to come here often,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cI mean to come often.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall be glad to see you,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered simply. And then, in a\r\nmoment: \xe2\x80\x9cYou probably think it very strange that there should be such a\r\nsolemnity\xe2\x80\x94as you say\xe2\x80\x94about your coming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, yes; I do, rather.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you remember what my brother Valentin said, the first time you came\r\nto see me\xe2\x80\x94that we were a strange, strange family?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was not the first time I came, but the second,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery true. Valentin annoyed me at the time, but now I know you better,\r\nI may tell you he was right. If you come often, you will see!\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nMadame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 turned away.\r\n\r\nNewman watched her a while, talking with other people, and then he took\r\nhis leave. He shook hands last with Valentin de Bellegarde, who came\r\nout with him to the top of the staircase. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, you have got your\r\npermit,\xe2\x80\x9d said Valentin. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope you liked the process.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like your sister, more than ever. But don\xe2\x80\x99t worry your brother any\r\nmore for my sake,\xe2\x80\x9d Newman added. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mind him. I am afraid he came\r\ndown on you in the smoking-room, after I went out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen my brother comes down on me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Valentin, \xe2\x80\x9che falls hard. I\r\nhave a peculiar way of receiving him. I must say,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\nthey came up to the mark much sooner than I expected. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nunderstand it, they must have had to turn the screw pretty tight. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na tribute to your millions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it\xe2\x80\x99s the most precious one they have ever received,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nNewman.\r\n\r\nHe was turning away when Valentin stopped him, looking at him with a\r\nbrilliant, softly-cynical glance. \xe2\x80\x9cI should like to know whether,\r\nwithin a few days, you have seen your venerable friend M. Nioche.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was yesterday at my rooms,\xe2\x80\x9d Newman answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did he tell you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing particular.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou didn\xe2\x80\x99t see the muzzle of a pistol sticking out of his pocket?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you driving at?\xe2\x80\x9d Newman demanded. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought he seemed rather\r\ncheerful for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nValentin broke into a laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cI am delighted to hear it! I win my bet.\r\nMademoiselle No\xc3\xa9mie has thrown her cap over the mill, as we say. She\r\nhas left the paternal domicile. She is launched! And M. Nioche is\r\nrather cheerful\xe2\x80\x94_for him!_ Don\xe2\x80\x99t brandish your tomahawk at that rate; I\r\nhave not seen her nor communicated with her since that day at the\r\nLouvre. Andromeda has found another Perseus than I. My information is\r\nexact; on such matters it always is. I suppose that now you will raise\r\nyour protest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy protest be hanged!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Newman, disgustedly.\r\n\r\nBut his tone found no echo in that in which Valentin, with his hand on\r\nthe door, to return to his mother\xe2\x80\x99s apartment, exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cBut I shall\r\nsee her now! She is very remarkable\xe2\x80\x94she is very remarkable!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n\r\nNewman kept his promise, or his menace, of going often to the Rue de\r\nl\xe2\x80\x99Universit\xc3\xa9, and during the next six weeks he saw Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9\r\nmore times than he could have numbered. He flattered himself that he\r\nwas not in love, but his biographer may be supposed to know better. He\r\nclaimed, at least, none of the exemptions and emoluments of the\r\nromantic passion. Love, he believed, made a fool of a man, and his\r\npresent emotion was not folly but wisdom; wisdom sound, serene,\r\nwell-directed. What he felt was an intense, all-consuming tenderness,\r\nwhich had for its object an extraordinarily graceful and delicate, and\r\nat the same time impressive, woman who lived in a large gray house on\r\nthe left bank of the Seine. This tenderness turned very often into a\r\npositive heartache; a sign in which, certainly, Newman ought to have\r\nread the appellation which science has conferred upon his sentiment.\r\nWhen the heart has a heavy weight upon it, it hardly matters whether\r\nthe weight be of gold or of lead; when, at any rate, happiness passes\r\ninto that place in which it becomes identical with pain, a man may\r\nadmit that the reign of wisdom is temporarily suspended. Newman wished\r\nMadame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 so well that nothing he could think of doing for her\r\nin the future rose to the high standard which his present mood had set\r\nitself. She seemed to him so felicitous a product of nature and\r\ncircumstance that his invention, musing on future combinations, was\r\nconstantly catching its breath with the fear of stumbling into some\r\nbrutal compression or mutilation of her beautiful personal harmony.\r\nThis is what I mean by Newman\xe2\x80\x99s tenderness: Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 pleased\r\nhim so, exactly as she was, that his desire to interpose between her\r\nand the troubles of life had the quality of a young mother\xe2\x80\x99s eagerness\r\nto protect the sleep of her first-born child. Newman was simply\r\ncharmed, and he handled his charm as if it were a music-box which would\r\nstop if one shook it. There can be no better proof of the hankering\r\nepicure that is hidden in every man\xe2\x80\x99s temperament, waiting for a signal\r\nfrom some divine confederate that he may safely peep out. Newman at\r\nlast was enjoying, purely, freely, deeply. Certain of Madame de\r\nCintr\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s personal qualities\xe2\x80\x94the luminous sweetness of her eyes, the\r\ndelicate mobility of her face, the deep liquidity of her voice\xe2\x80\x94filled\r\nall his consciousness. A rose-crowned Greek of old, gazing at a marble\r\ngoddess with his whole bright intellect resting satisfied in the act,\r\ncould not have been a more complete embodiment of the wisdom that loses\r\nitself in the enjoyment of quiet harmonies.\r\n\r\nHe made no violent love to her\xe2\x80\x94no sentimental speeches. He never\r\ntrespassed on what she had made him understand was for the present\r\nforbidden ground. But he had, nevertheless, a comfortable sense that\r\nshe knew better from day to day how much he admired her. Though in\r\ngeneral he was no great talker, he talked much, and he succeeded\r\nperfectly in making her say many things. He was not afraid of boring\r\nher, either by his discourse or by his silence; and whether or no he\r\ndid occasionally bore her, it is probable that on the whole she liked\r\nhim only the better for his absence of embarrassed scruples. Her\r\nvisitors, coming in often while Newman sat there, found a tall, lean,\r\nsilent man in a half-lounging attitude, who laughed out sometimes when\r\nno one had meant to be droll, and remained grave in the presence of\r\ncalculated witticisms, for appreciation of which he had apparently not\r\nthe proper culture.\r\n\r\nIt must be confessed that the number of subjects upon which Newman had\r\nno ideas was extremely large, and it must be added that as regards\r\nthose subjects upon which he was without ideas he was also perfectly\r\nwithout words. He had little of the small change of conversation, and\r\nhis stock of ready-made formulas and phrases was the scantiest. On the\r\nother hand he had plenty of attention to bestow, and his estimate of\r\nthe importance of a topic did not depend upon the number of clever\r\nthings he could say about it. He himself was almost never bored, and\r\nthere was no man with whom it would have been a greater mistake to\r\nsuppose that silence meant displeasure. What it was that entertained\r\nhim during some of his speechless sessions I must, however, confess\r\nmyself unable to determine. We know in a general way that a great many\r\nthings which were old stories to a great many people had the charm of\r\nnovelty to him, but a complete list of his new impressions would\r\nprobably contain a number of surprises for us. He told Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9\r\na hundred long stories; he explained to her, in talking of the United\r\nStates, the working of various local institutions and mercantile\r\ncustoms. Judging by the sequel she was interested, but one would not\r\nhave been sure of it beforehand. As regards her own talk, Newman was\r\nvery sure himself that she herself enjoyed it: this was as a sort of\r\namendment to the portrait that Mrs. Tristram had drawn of her. He\r\ndiscovered that she had naturally an abundance of gaiety. He had been\r\nright at first in saying she was shy; her shyness, in a woman whose\r\ncircumstances and tranquil beauty afforded every facility for\r\nwell-mannered hardihood, was only a charm the more. For Newman it had\r\nlasted some time, and even when it went it left something behind it\r\nwhich for a while performed the same office. Was this the tearful\r\nsecret of which Mrs. Tristram had had a glimpse, and of which, as of\r\nher friend\xe2\x80\x99s reserve, her high-breeding, and her profundity, she had\r\ngiven a sketch of which the outlines were, perhaps, rather too heavy?\r\nNewman supposed so, but he found himself wondering less every day what\r\nMadame de Cintr\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s secrets might be, and more convinced that secrets\r\nwere, in themselves, hateful things to her. She was a woman for the\r\nlight, not for the shade; and her natural line was not picturesque\r\nreserve and mysterious melancholy, but frank, joyous, brilliant action,\r\nwith just so much meditation as was necessary, and not a grain more. To\r\nthis, apparently, he had succeeded in bringing her back. He felt,\r\nhimself, that he was an antidote to oppressive secrets; what he offered\r\nher was, in fact, above all things a vast, sunny immunity from the need\r\nof having any.\r\n\r\nHe often passed his evenings, when Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 had so appointed\r\nit, at the chilly fireside of Madame de Bellegarde, contenting himself\r\nwith looking across the room, through narrowed eyelids, at his\r\nmistress, who always made a point, before her family, of talking to\r\nsomeone else. Madame de Bellegarde sat by the fire conversing neatly\r\nand coldly with whomsoever approached her, and glancing round the room\r\nwith her slowly-restless eye, the effect of which, when it lighted upon\r\nhim, was to Newman\xe2\x80\x99s sense identical with that of a sudden spurt of\r\ndamp air. When he shook hands with her he always asked her with a laugh\r\nwhether she could \xe2\x80\x9cstand him\xe2\x80\x9d another evening, and she replied, without\r\na laugh, that thank God she had always been able to do her duty.\r\nNewman, talking once of the marquise to Mrs. Tristram, said that after\r\nall it was very easy to get on with her; it always was easy to get on\r\nwith out-and-out rascals.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd is it by that elegant term,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Tristram, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you\r\ndesignate the Marquise de Bellegarde?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, \xe2\x80\x9cshe is wicked, she is an old sinner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is her crime?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs. Tristram.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wonder if she had murdered someone\xe2\x80\x94all from a sense of\r\nduty, of course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can you be so dreadful?\xe2\x80\x9d sighed Mrs. Tristram.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not dreadful. I am speaking of her favorably.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray what will you say when you want to be severe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall keep my severity for someone else\xe2\x80\x94for the marquis. There\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nman I can\xe2\x80\x99t swallow, mix the drink as I will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what has _he_ done?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t quite make out; it is something dreadfully bad, something mean\r\nand underhand, and not redeemed by audacity, as his mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmisdemeanors may have been. If he has never committed murder, he has at\r\nleast turned his back and looked the other way while someone else was\r\ncommitting it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn spite of this invidious hypothesis, which must be taken for nothing\r\nmore than an example of the capricious play of \xe2\x80\x9cAmerican humor,\xe2\x80\x9d Newman\r\ndid his best to maintain an easy and friendly style of communication\r\nwith M. de Bellegarde. So long as he was in personal contact with\r\npeople he disliked extremely to have anything to forgive them, and he\r\nwas capable of a good deal of unsuspected imaginative effort (for the\r\nsake of his own personal comfort) to assume for the time that they were\r\ngood fellows. He did his best to treat the marquis as one; he believed\r\nhonestly, moreover, that he could not, in reason, be such a confounded\r\nfool as he seemed. Newman\xe2\x80\x99s familiarity was never importunate; his\r\nsense of human equality was not an aggressive taste or an \xc3\xa6sthetic\r\ntheory, but something as natural and organic as a physical appetite\r\nwhich had never been put on a scanty allowance and consequently was\r\ninnocent of ungraceful eagerness. His tranquil unsuspectingness of the\r\nrelativity of his own place in the social scale was probably irritating\r\nto M. de Bellegarde, who saw himself reflected in the mind of his\r\npotential brother-in-law in a crude and colorless form, unpleasantly\r\ndissimilar to the impressive image projected upon his own intellectual\r\nmirror. He never forgot himself for an instant, and replied to what he\r\nmust have considered Newman\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cadvances\xe2\x80\x9d with mechanical politeness.\r\nNewman, who was constantly forgetting himself, and indulging in an\r\nunlimited amount of irresponsible inquiry and conjecture, now and then\r\nfound himself confronted by the conscious, ironical smile of his host.\r\nWhat the deuce M. de Bellegarde was smiling at he was at a loss to\r\ndivine. M. de Bellegarde\xe2\x80\x99s smile may be supposed to have been, for\r\nhimself, a compromise between a great many emotions. So long as he\r\nsmiled he was polite, and it was proper he should be polite. A smile,\r\nmoreover, committed him to nothing more than politeness, and left the\r\ndegree of politeness agreeably vague. A smile, too, was neither\r\ndissent\xe2\x80\x94which was too serious\xe2\x80\x94nor agreement, which might have brought\r\non terrible complications. And then a smile covered his own personal\r\ndignity, which in this critical situation he was resolved to keep\r\nimmaculate; it was quite enough that the glory of his house should pass\r\ninto eclipse. Between him and Newman, his whole manner seemed to\r\ndeclare there could be no interchange of opinion; he was holding his\r\nbreath so as not to inhale the odor of democracy. Newman was far from\r\nbeing versed in European politics, but he liked to have a general idea\r\nof what was going on about him, and he accordingly asked M. de\r\nBellegarde several times what he thought of public affairs. M. de\r\nBellegarde answered with suave concision that he thought as ill of them\r\nas possible, that they were going from bad to worse, and that the age\r\nwas rotten to its core. This gave Newman, for the moment, an almost\r\nkindly feeling for the marquis; he pitied a man for whom the world was\r\nso cheerless a place, and the next time he saw M. de Bellegarde he\r\nattempted to call his attention to some of the brilliant features of\r\nthe time. The marquis presently replied that he had but a single\r\npolitical conviction, which was enough for him: he believed in the\r\ndivine right of Henry of Bourbon, Fifth of his name, to the throne of\r\nFrance. Newman stared, and after this he ceased to talk politics with\r\nM. de Bellegarde. He was not horrified nor scandalized, he was not even\r\namused; he felt as he should have felt if he had discovered in M. de\r\nBellegarde a taste for certain oddities of diet; an appetite, for\r\ninstance, for fishbones or nutshells. Under these circumstances, of\r\ncourse, he would never have broached dietary questions with him.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon, on his calling on Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9, Newman was requested\r\nby the servant to wait a few moments, as his hostess was not at\r\nliberty. He walked about the room a while, taking up her books,\r\nsmelling her flowers, and looking at her prints and photographs (which\r\nhe thought prodigiously pretty), and at last he heard the opening of a\r\ndoor to which his back was turned. On the threshold stood an old woman\r\nwhom he remembered to have met several times in entering and leaving\r\nthe house. She was tall and straight and dressed in black, and she wore\r\na cap which, if Newman had been initiated into such mysteries, would\r\nhave been a sufficient assurance that she was not a Frenchwoman; a cap\r\nof pure British composition. She had a pale, decent, depressed-looking\r\nface, and a clear, dull, English eye. She looked at Newman a moment,\r\nboth intently and timidly, and then she dropped a short, straight\r\nEnglish curtsey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 begs you will kindly wait,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cShe has just\r\ncome in; she will soon have finished dressing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I will wait as long as she wants,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cPray tell her not\r\nto hurry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman, softly; and then, instead of retiring\r\nwith her message, she advanced into the room. She looked about her for\r\na moment, and presently went to a table and began to arrange certain\r\nbooks and knick-knacks. Newman was struck with the high respectability\r\nof her appearance; he was afraid to address her as a servant. She\r\nbusied herself for some moments with putting the table in order and\r\npulling the curtains straight, while Newman walked slowly to and fro.\r\nHe perceived at last from her reflection in the mirror, as he was\r\npassing that her hands were idle and that she was looking at him\r\nintently. She evidently wished to say something, and Newman, perceiving\r\nit, helped her to begin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are English?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir, please,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, quickly and softly; \xe2\x80\x9cI was born in\r\nWiltshire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what do you think of Paris?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think of Paris, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in the same tone. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is so\r\nlong since I have been here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you have been here very long?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is more than forty years, sir. I came over with Lady Emmeline.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean with old Madame de Bellegarde?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir. I came with her when she was married. I was my lady\xe2\x80\x99s own\r\nwoman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you have been with her ever since?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been in the house ever since. My lady has taken a younger\r\nperson. You see I am very old. I do nothing regular now. But I keep\r\nabout.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou look very strong and well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, observing the erectness\r\nof her figure, and a certain venerable rosiness in her cheek.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank God I am not ill, sir; I hope I know my duty too well to go\r\npanting and coughing about the house. But I am an old woman, sir, and\r\nit is as an old woman that I venture to speak to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, speak out,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, curiously. \xe2\x80\x9cYou needn\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir. I think you are kind. I have seen you before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the stairs, you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir. When you have been coming to see the countess. I have taken\r\nthe liberty of noticing that you come often.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes; I come very often,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cYou need not have\r\nbeen wide-awake to notice that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have noticed it with pleasure, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the ancient tirewoman,\r\ngravely. And she stood looking at Newman with a strange expression of\r\nface. The old instinct of deference and humility was there; the habit\r\nof decent self-effacement and knowledge of her \xe2\x80\x9cown place.\xe2\x80\x9d But there\r\nmingled with it a certain mild audacity, born of the occasion and of a\r\nsense, probably, of Newman\xe2\x80\x99s unprecedented approachableness, and,\r\nbeyond this, a vague indifference to the old proprieties; as if my\r\nlady\xe2\x80\x99s own woman had at last begun to reflect that, since my lady had\r\ntaken another person, she had a slight reversionary property in\r\nherself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou take a great interest in the family?\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA deep interest, sir. Especially in the countess.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad of that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. And in a moment he added, smiling,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo do I!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I suppose, sir. We can\xe2\x80\x99t help noticing these things and having our\r\nideas; can we, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean as a servant?\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, there it is, sir. I am afraid that when I let my thoughts meddle\r\nwith such matters I am no longer a servant. But I am so devoted to the\r\ncountess; if she were my own child I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t love her more. That is\r\nhow I come to be so bold, sir. They say you want to marry her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman eyed his interlocutress and satisfied himself that she was not a\r\ngossip, but a zealot; she looked anxious, appealing, discreet. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is\r\nquite true,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to marry Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd to take her away to America?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will take her wherever she wants to go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe farther away the better, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the old woman, with\r\nsudden intensity. But she checked herself, and, taking up a\r\npaper-weight in mosaic, began to polish it with her black apron. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t mean anything against the house or the family, sir. But I think a\r\ngreat change would do the poor countess good. It is very sad here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it\xe2\x80\x99s not very lively,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cBut Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 is gay\r\nherself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is everything that is good. You will not be vexed to hear that she\r\nhas been gayer for a couple of months past than she had been in many a\r\nday before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman was delighted to gather this testimony to the prosperity of his\r\nsuit, but he repressed all violent marks of elation. \xe2\x80\x9cHas Madame de\r\nCintr\xc3\xa9 been in bad spirits before this?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor lady, she had good reason. M. de Cintr\xc3\xa9 was no husband for a\r\nsweet young lady like that. And then, as I say, it has been a sad\r\nhouse. It is better, in my humble opinion, that she were out of it. So,\r\nif you will excuse me for saying so, I hope she will marry you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope she will!\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you must not lose courage, sir, if she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make up her mind at\r\nonce. That is what I wanted to beg of you, sir. Don\xe2\x80\x99t give it up, sir.\r\nYou will not take it ill if I say it\xe2\x80\x99s a great risk for any lady at any\r\ntime; all the more when she has got rid of one bad bargain. But if she\r\ncan marry a good, kind, respectable gentleman, I think she had better\r\nmake up her mind to it. They speak very well of you, sir, in the house,\r\nand, if you will allow me to say so, I like your face. You have a very\r\ndifferent appearance from the late count, he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t five feet high. And\r\nthey say your fortune is beyond everything. There\xe2\x80\x99s no harm in that. So\r\nI beseech you to be patient, sir, and bide your time. If I don\xe2\x80\x99t say\r\nthis to you, sir, perhaps no one will. Of course it is not for me to\r\nmake any promises. I can answer for nothing. But I think your chance is\r\nnot so bad, sir. I am nothing but a weary old woman in my quiet corner,\r\nbut one woman understands another, and I think I make out the countess.\r\nI received her in my arms when she came into the world and her first\r\nwedding day was the saddest of my life. She owes it to me to show me\r\nanother and a brighter one. If you will hold firm, sir\xe2\x80\x94and you look as\r\nif you would\xe2\x80\x94I think we may see it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am much obliged to you for your encouragement,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman,\r\nheartily. \xe2\x80\x9cOne can\xe2\x80\x99t have too much. I mean to hold firm. And if Madame\r\nde Cintr\xc3\xa9 marries me you must come and live with her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old woman looked at him strangely, with her soft, lifeless eyes.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt may seem a heartless thing to say, sir, when one has been forty\r\nyears in a house, but I may tell you that I should like to leave this\r\nplace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, it\xe2\x80\x99s just the time to say it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, fervently. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter\r\nforty years one wants a change.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are very kind, sir;\xe2\x80\x9d and this faithful servant dropped another\r\ncurtsey and seemed disposed to retire. But she lingered a moment and\r\ngave a timid, joyless smile. Newman was disappointed, and his fingers\r\nstole half shyly half irritably into his waistcoat-pocket. His\r\ninformant noticed the movement. \xe2\x80\x9cThank God I am not a Frenchwoman,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I were, I would tell you with a brazen simper, old as I am,\r\nthat if you please, monsieur, my information is worth something. Let me\r\ntell you so in my own decent English way. It _is_ worth something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much, please?\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSimply this: a promise not to hint to the countess that I have said\r\nthese things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf that is all, you have it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is all, sir. Thank you, sir. Good day, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d And having once more\r\nslid down telescope-wise into her scanty petticoats, the old woman\r\ndeparted. At the same moment Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 came in by an opposite\r\ndoor. She noticed the movement of the other _porti\xc3\xa8re_ and asked Newman\r\nwho had been entertaining him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe British female!\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cAn old lady in a black dress and a\r\ncap, who curtsies up and down, and expresses herself ever so well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn old lady who curtsies and expresses herself?... Ah, you mean poor\r\nMrs. Bread. I happen to know that you have made a conquest of her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Cake, she ought to be called,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is very sweet.\r\nShe is a delicious old woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 looked at him a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat can she have said to\r\nyou? She is an excellent creature, but we think her rather dismal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d Newman answered presently, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I like her because she\r\nhas lived near you so long. Since your birth, she told me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9, simply; \xe2\x80\x9cshe is very faithful; I can\r\ntrust her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman had never made any reflections to this lady upon her mother and\r\nher brother Urbain; had given no hint of the impression they made upon\r\nhim. But, as if she had guessed his thoughts, she seemed careful to\r\navoid all occasion for making him speak of them. She never alluded to\r\nher mother\xe2\x80\x99s domestic decrees; she never quoted the opinions of the\r\nmarquis. They had talked, however, of Valentin, and she had made no\r\nsecret of her extreme affection for her younger brother. Newman\r\nlistened sometimes with a certain harmless jealousy; he would have\r\nliked to divert some of her tender allusions to his own credit. Once\r\nMadame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 told him with a little air of triumph about something\r\nthat Valentin had done which she thought very much to his honor. It was\r\na service he had rendered to an old friend of the family; something\r\nmore \xe2\x80\x9cserious\xe2\x80\x9d than Valentin was usually supposed capable of being.\r\nNewman said he was glad to hear of it, and then began to talk about\r\nsomething which lay upon his own heart. Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 listened, but\r\nafter a while she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like the way you speak of my brother\r\nValentin.\xe2\x80\x9d Hereupon Newman, surprised, said that he had never spoken of\r\nhim but kindly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is too kindly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a kindness that costs\r\nnothing; it is the kindness you show to a child. It is as if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nrespect him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRespect him? Why I think I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think? If you are not sure, it is no respect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you respect him?\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you do, I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf one loves a person, that is a question one is not bound to answer,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou should not have asked it of me, then. I am very fond of your\r\nbrother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe amuses you. But you would not like to resemble him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like to resemble anyone. It is hard enough work resembling\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s self.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean,\xe2\x80\x9d asked Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9, \xe2\x80\x9cby resembling one\xe2\x80\x99s self?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, doing what is expected of one. Doing one\xe2\x80\x99s duty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that is only when one is very good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, a great many people are good,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cValentin is quite\r\ngood enough for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 was silent for a short time. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is not good enough\r\nfor me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said at last. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish he would do something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can he do?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing. Yet he is very clever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a proof of cleverness,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, \xe2\x80\x9cto be happy without doing\r\nanything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think Valentin is happy, in reality. He is clever, generous,\r\nbrave; but what is there to show for it? To me there is something sad\r\nin his life, and sometimes I have a sort of foreboding about him. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know why, but I fancy he will have some great trouble\xe2\x80\x94perhaps an\r\nunhappy end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, leave him to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, jovially. \xe2\x80\x9cI will watch over him\r\nand keep harm away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne evening, in Madame de Bellegarde\xe2\x80\x99s salon, the conversation had\r\nflagged most sensibly. The marquis walked up and down in silence, like\r\na sentinel at the door of some smooth-fronted citadel of the\r\nproprieties; his mother sat staring at the fire; young Madame de\r\nBellegarde worked at an enormous band of tapestry. Usually there were\r\nthree or four visitors, but on this occasion a violent storm\r\nsufficiently accounted for the absence of even the most devoted\r\nhabitu\xc3\xa9s. In the long silences the howling of the wind and the beating\r\nof the rain were distinctly audible. Newman sat perfectly still,\r\nwatching the clock, determined to stay till the stroke of eleven, but\r\nnot a moment longer. Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 had turned her back to the\r\ncircle, and had been standing for some time within the uplifted curtain\r\nof a window, with her forehead against the pane, gazing out into the\r\ndeluged darkness. Suddenly she turned round toward her sister-in-law.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with peculiar eagerness, \xe2\x80\x9cgo to the\r\npiano and play something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame de Bellegarde held up her tapestry and pointed to a little white\r\nflower. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t ask me to leave this. I am in the midst of a\r\nmasterpiece. My flower is going to smell very sweet; I am putting in\r\nthe smell with this gold-colored silk. I am holding my breath; I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nleave off. Play something yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is absurd for me to play when you are present,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de\r\nCintr\xc3\xa9. But the next moment she went to the piano and began to strike\r\nthe keys with vehemence. She played for some time, rapidly and\r\nbrilliantly; when she stopped, Newman went to the piano and asked her\r\nto begin again. She shook her head, and, on his insisting, she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nhave not been playing for you; I have been playing for myself.\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\nwent back to the window again and looked out, and shortly afterwards\r\nleft the room. When Newman took leave, Urbain de Bellegarde accompanied\r\nhim, as he always did, just three steps down the staircase. At the\r\nbottom stood a servant with his overcoat. He had just put it on when he\r\nsaw Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 coming towards him across the vestibule.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall you be at home on Friday?\xe2\x80\x9d Newman asked.\r\n\r\nShe looked at him a moment before answering his question. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlike my mother and my brother,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nHe hesitated a moment, and then he said softly, \xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe laid her hand on the balustrade and prepared to ascend the stairs,\r\nfixing her eyes on the first step.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I shall be at home on Friday,\xe2\x80\x9d and she passed up the wide dusky\r\nstaircase.\r\n\r\nOn the Friday, as soon as he came in, she asked him to please to tell\r\nher why he disliked her family.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDislike your family?\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cThat has a horrid sound. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsay so, did I? I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean it, if I did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you would tell me what you think of them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de\r\nCintr\xc3\xa9.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think of any of them but you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is because you dislike them. Speak the truth; you can\xe2\x80\x99t offend\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I don\xe2\x80\x99t exactly love your brother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cI remember\r\nnow. But what is the use of my saying so? I had forgotten it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are too good-natured,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 gravely. Then, as if\r\nto avoid the appearance of inviting him to speak ill of the marquis,\r\nshe turned away, motioning him to sit down.\r\n\r\nBut he remained standing before her and said presently, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is of\r\nmuch more importance is that they don\xe2\x80\x99t like me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94they don\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd don\xe2\x80\x99t you think they are wrong?\xe2\x80\x9d Newman asked. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe I\r\nam a man to dislike.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose that a man who may be liked may also be disliked. And my\r\nbrother\xe2\x80\x94my mother,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, \xe2\x80\x9chave not made you angry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sometimes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have never shown it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo much the better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, so much the better. They think they have treated you very well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no doubt they might have handled me much more roughly,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nNewman. \xe2\x80\x9cI am much obliged to them. Honestly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are generous,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a disagreeable\r\nposition.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor them, you mean. Not for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot when their sins are forgiven!\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cThey don\xe2\x80\x99t think I am\r\nas good as they are. I do. But we shan\xe2\x80\x99t quarrel about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t even agree with you without saying something that has a\r\ndisagreeable sound. The presumption was against you. That you probably\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t understand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman sat down and looked at her for some time. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\r\nreally understand it. But when you say it, I believe it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a poor reason,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9, smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it\xe2\x80\x99s a very good one. You have a high spirit, a high standard; but\r\nwith you it\xe2\x80\x99s all natural and unaffected; you don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to have stuck\r\nyour head into a vise, as if you were sitting for the photograph of\r\npropriety. You think of me as a fellow who has had no idea in life but\r\nto make money and drive sharp bargains. That\xe2\x80\x99s a fair description of\r\nme, but it is not the whole story. A man ought to care for something\r\nelse, though I don\xe2\x80\x99t know exactly what. I cared for money-making, but I\r\nnever cared particularly for the money. There was nothing else to do,\r\nand it was impossible to be idle. I have been very easy to others, and\r\nto myself. I have done most of the things that people asked me\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmean rascals. As regards your mother and your brother,\xe2\x80\x9d Newman added,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthere is only one point upon which I feel that I might quarrel with\r\nthem. I don\xe2\x80\x99t ask them to sing my praises to you, but I ask them to let\r\nyou alone. If I thought they talked ill of me to you, I should come\r\ndown upon them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey have let me alone, as you say. They have not talked ill of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Newman, \xe2\x80\x9cI declare they are only too good for\r\nthis world!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 appeared to find something startling in his\r\nexclamation. She would, perhaps, have replied, but at this moment the\r\ndoor was thrown open and Urbain de Bellegarde stepped across the\r\nthreshold. He appeared surprised at finding Newman, but his surprise\r\nwas but a momentary shadow across the surface of an unwonted joviality.\r\nNewman had never seen the marquis so exhilarated; his pale, unlighted\r\ncountenance had a sort of thin transfiguration. He held open the door\r\nfor someone else to enter, and presently appeared old Madame de\r\nBellegarde, leaning on the arm of a gentleman whom Newman had not seen\r\nbefore. He had already risen, and Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 rose, as she always\r\ndid before her mother. The marquis, who had greeted Newman almost\r\ngenially, stood apart, slowly rubbing his hands. His mother came\r\nforward with her companion. She gave a majestic little nod at Newman,\r\nand then she released the strange gentleman, that he might make his bow\r\nto her daughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy daughter,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI have brought you an unknown relative, Lord\r\nDeepmere. Lord Deepmere is our cousin, but he has done only to-day what\r\nhe ought to have done long ago\xe2\x80\x94come to make our acquaintance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 smiled, and offered Lord Deepmere her hand. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is\r\nvery extraordinary,\xe2\x80\x9d said this noble laggard, \xe2\x80\x9cbut this is the first\r\ntime that I have ever been in Paris for more than three or four weeks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how long have you been here now?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, for the last two months,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lord Deepmere.\r\n\r\nThese two remarks might have constituted an impertinence; but a glance\r\nat Lord Deepmere\xe2\x80\x99s face would have satisfied you, as it apparently\r\nsatisfied Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9, that they constituted only a _na\xc3\xafvet\xc3\xa9_.\r\nWhen his companions were seated, Newman, who was out of the\r\nconversation, occupied himself with observing the newcomer.\r\nObservation, however, as regards Lord Deepmere\xe2\x80\x99s person; had no great\r\nrange. He was a small, meagre man, of some three and thirty years of\r\nage, with a bald head, a short nose and no front teeth in the upper\r\njaw; he had round, candid blue eyes, and several pimples on his chin.\r\nHe was evidently very shy, and he laughed a great deal, catching his\r\nbreath with an odd, startling sound, as the most convenient imitation\r\nof repose. His physiognomy denoted great simplicity, a certain amount\r\nof brutality, and probable failure in the past to profit by rare\r\neducational advantages. He remarked that Paris was awfully jolly, but\r\nthat for real, thorough-paced entertainment it was nothing to Dublin.\r\nHe even preferred Dublin to London. Had Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 ever been to\r\nDublin? They must all come over there some day, and he would show them\r\nsome Irish sport. He always went to Ireland for the fishing, and he\r\ncame to Paris for the new Offenbach things. They always brought them\r\nout in Dublin, but he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t wait. He had been nine times to hear La\r\nPomme de Paris. Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9, leaning back, with her arms folded,\r\nlooked at Lord Deepmere with a more visibly puzzled face than she\r\nusually showed to society. Madame de Bellegarde, on the other hand,\r\nwore a fixed smile. The marquis said that among light operas his\r\nfavorite was the Gazza Ladra. The marquise then began a series of\r\ninquiries about the duke and the cardinal, the old countess and Lady\r\nBarbara, after listening to which, and to Lord Deepmere\xe2\x80\x99s somewhat\r\nirreverent responses, for a quarter of an hour, Newman rose to take his\r\nleave. The marquis went with him three steps into the hall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he Irish?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Newman, nodding in the direction of the visitor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis mother was the daughter of Lord Finucane,\xe2\x80\x9d said the marquis; \xe2\x80\x9che\r\nhas great Irish estates. Lady Bridget, in the complete absence of male\r\nheirs, either direct or collateral\xe2\x80\x94a most extraordinary\r\ncircumstance\xe2\x80\x94came in for everything. But Lord Deepmere\xe2\x80\x99s title is\r\nEnglish and his English property is immense. He is a charming young\r\nman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman answered nothing, but he detained the marquis as the latter was\r\nbeginning gracefully to recede. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a good time for me to thank\r\nyou,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cfor sticking so punctiliously to our bargain, for doing\r\nso much to help me on with your sister.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe marquis stared. \xe2\x80\x9cReally, I have done nothing that I can boast of,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh don\xe2\x80\x99t be modest,\xe2\x80\x9d Newman answered, laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t flatter\r\nmyself that I am doing so well simply by my own merit. And thank your\r\nmother for me, too!\xe2\x80\x9d And he turned away, leaving M. de Bellegarde\r\nlooking after him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next time Newman came to the Rue de l\xe2\x80\x99Universit\xc3\xa9 he had the good\r\nfortune to find Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 alone. He had come with a definite\r\nintention, and he lost no time in executing it. She wore, moreover, a\r\nlook which he eagerly interpreted as expectancy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been coming to see you for six months, now,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\r\nhave never spoken to you a second time of marriage. That was what you\r\nasked me; I obeyed. Could any man have done better?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have acted with great delicacy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to change now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mean that I am\r\ngoing to be indelicate; but I\xe2\x80\x99m going to go back to where I began. I\r\n_am_ back there. I have been all round the circle. Or rather, I have\r\nnever been away from here. I have never ceased to want what I wanted\r\nthen. Only now I am more sure of it, if possible; I am more sure of\r\nmyself, and more sure of you. I know you better, though I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nanything I didn\xe2\x80\x99t believe three months ago. You are everything\xe2\x80\x94you are\r\nbeyond everything\xe2\x80\x94I can imagine or desire. You know me now; you _must_\r\nknow me. I won\xe2\x80\x99t say that you have seen the best\xe2\x80\x94but you have seen the\r\nworst. I hope you have been thinking all this while. You must have seen\r\nthat I was only waiting; you can\xe2\x80\x99t suppose that I was changing. What\r\nwill you say to me, now? Say that everything is clear and reasonable,\r\nand that I have been very patient and considerate, and deserve my\r\nreward. And then give me your hand. Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 do that. Do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew you were only waiting,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cand I was very sure this day\r\nwould come. I have thought about it a great deal. At first I was half\r\nafraid of it. But I am not afraid of it now.\xe2\x80\x9d She paused a moment, and\r\nthen she added, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a relief.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was sitting on a low chair, and Newman was on an ottoman, near her.\r\nHe leaned a little and took her hand, which for an instant she let him\r\nkeep. \xe2\x80\x9cThat means that I have not waited for nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. She\r\nlooked at him for a moment, and he saw her eyes fill with tears. \xe2\x80\x9cWith\r\nme,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will be as safe\xe2\x80\x94as safe\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and even in his ardor he\r\nhesitated a moment for a comparison\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cas safe,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with a kind of\r\nsimple solemnity, \xe2\x80\x9cas in your father\xe2\x80\x99s arms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStill she looked at him and her tears increased. Then, abruptly, she\r\nburied her face on the cushioned arm of the sofa beside her chair, and\r\nbroke into noiseless sobs. \xe2\x80\x9cI am weak\xe2\x80\x94I am weak,\xe2\x80\x9d he heard her say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll the more reason why you should give yourself up to me,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nanswered. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy are you troubled? There is nothing but happiness. Is\r\nthat so hard to believe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo you everything seems so simple,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, raising her head. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\nthings are not so. I like you extremely. I liked you six months ago,\r\nand now I am sure of it, as you say you are sure. But it is not easy,\r\nsimply for that, to decide to marry you. There are a great many things\r\nto think about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere ought to be only one thing to think about\xe2\x80\x94that we love each\r\nother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. And as she remained silent he quickly added, \xe2\x80\x9cVery\r\ngood, if you can\xe2\x80\x99t accept that, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should be very glad to think of nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d she said at last; \xe2\x80\x9cnot to\r\nthink at all; only to shut both my eyes and give myself up. But I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t. I\xe2\x80\x99m cold, I\xe2\x80\x99m old, I\xe2\x80\x99m a coward; I never supposed I should marry\r\nagain, and it seems to me very strange I should ever have listened to\r\nyou. When I used to think, as a girl, of what I should do if I were to\r\nmarry freely, by my own choice, I thought of a very different man from\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s nothing against me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman with an immense smile; \xe2\x80\x9cyour\r\ntaste was not formed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis smile made Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 smile. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you formed it?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\nAnd then she said, in a different tone, \xe2\x80\x9cWhere do you wish to live?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnywhere in the wide world you like. We can easily settle that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know why I ask you,\xe2\x80\x9d she presently continued. \xe2\x80\x9cI care very\r\nlittle. I think if I were to marry you I could live almost anywhere.\r\nYou have some false ideas about me; you think that I need a great many\r\nthings\xe2\x80\x94that I must have a brilliant, worldly life. I am sure you are\r\nprepared to take a great deal of trouble to give me such things. But\r\nthat is very arbitrary; I have done nothing to prove that.\xe2\x80\x9d She paused\r\nagain, looking at him, and her mingled sound and silence were so sweet\r\nto him that he had no wish to hurry her, any more than he would have\r\nhad a wish to hurry a golden sunrise. \xe2\x80\x9cYour being so different, which\r\nat first seemed a difficulty, a trouble, began one day to seem to me a\r\npleasure, a great pleasure. I was glad you were different. And yet if I\r\nhad said so, no one would have understood me; I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean simply to my\r\nfamily.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey would have said I was a queer monster, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey would have said I could never be happy with you\xe2\x80\x94you were too\r\ndifferent; and I would have said it was just _because_ you were so\r\ndifferent that I might be happy. But they would have given better\r\nreasons than I. My only reason\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and she paused again.\r\n\r\nBut this time, in the midst of his golden sunrise, Newman felt the\r\nimpulse to grasp at a rosy cloud. \xe2\x80\x9cYour only reason is that you love\r\nme!\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured with an eloquent gesture, and for want of a better\r\nreason Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 reconciled herself to this one.\r\n\r\nNewman came back the next day, and in the vestibule, as he entered the\r\nhouse, he encountered his friend Mrs. Bread. She was wandering about in\r\nhonorable idleness, and when his eyes fell upon her she delivered him\r\none of her curtsies. Then turning to the servant who had admitted him,\r\nshe said, with the combined majesty of her native superiority and of a\r\nrugged English accent, \xe2\x80\x9cYou may retire; I will have the honor of\r\nconducting monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d In spite of this combination, however, it\r\nappeared to Newman that her voice had a slight quaver, as if the tone\r\nof command were not habitual to it. The man gave her an impertinent\r\nstare, but he walked slowly away, and she led Newman upstairs. At half\r\nits course the staircase gave a bend, forming a little platform. In the\r\nangle of the wall stood an indifferent statue of an eighteenth-century\r\nnymph, simpering, sallow, and cracked. Here Mrs. Bread stopped and\r\nlooked with shy kindness at her companion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know the good news, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have a good right to be first to know it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have\r\ntaken such a friendly interest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Bread turned away and began to blow the dust off the statue, as if\r\nthis might be mockery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you want to congratulate me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cI am greatly\r\nobliged.\xe2\x80\x9d And then he added, \xe2\x80\x9cYou gave me much pleasure the other day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned around, apparently reassured. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are not to think that I\r\nhave been told anything,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cI have only guessed. But when I\r\nlooked at you, as you came in, I was sure I had guessed aright.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are very sharp,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cI am sure that in your quiet way\r\nyou see everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not a fool, sir, thank God. I have guessed something else\r\nbeside,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bread.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI needn\xe2\x80\x99t tell you that, sir; I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you would believe it. At\r\nany rate it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t please you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, tell me nothing but what will please me,\xe2\x80\x9d laughed Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is\r\nthe way you began.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, sir, I suppose you won\xe2\x80\x99t be vexed to hear that the sooner\r\neverything is over the better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe sooner we are married, you mean? The better for me, certainly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe better for everyone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe better for you, perhaps. You know you are coming to live with us,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m extremely obliged to you, sir, but it is not of myself I was\r\nthinking. I only wanted, if I might take the liberty, to recommend you\r\nto lose no time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhom are you afraid of?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Bread looked up the staircase and then down and then she looked at\r\nthe undusted nymph, as if she possibly had sentient ears. \xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid\r\nof everyone,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat an uncomfortable state of mind!\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cDoes \xe2\x80\x98everyone\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwish to prevent my marriage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid of already having said too much,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Bread replied. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t take it back, but I won\xe2\x80\x99t say any more.\xe2\x80\x9d And she took her way up\r\nthe staircase again and led him into Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s salon.\r\n\r\nNewman indulged in a brief and silent imprecation when he found that\r\nMadame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 was not alone. With her sat her mother, and in the\r\nmiddle of the room stood young Madame de Bellegarde, in her bonnet and\r\nmantle. The old marquise, who was leaning back in her chair with a hand\r\nclasping the knob of each arm, looked at him fixedly without moving.\r\nShe seemed barely conscious of his greeting; she appeared to be musing\r\nintently. Newman said to himself that her daughter had been announcing\r\nher engagement and that the old lady found the morsel hard to swallow.\r\nBut Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9, as she gave him her hand gave him also a look by\r\nwhich she appeared to mean that he should understand something. Was it\r\na warning or a request? Did she wish to enjoin speech or silence? He\r\nwas puzzled, and young Madame de Bellegarde\xe2\x80\x99s pretty grin gave him no\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not told my mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 abruptly, looking at\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTold me what?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded the marquise. \xe2\x80\x9cYou tell me too little; you\r\nshould tell me everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is what I do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame Urbain, with a little laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet _me_ tell your mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\nThe old lady stared at him again, and then turned to her daughter. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nare going to marry him?\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, softly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Oui, ma m\xc3\xa8re_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour daughter has consented, to my great happiness,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when was this arrangement made?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Madame de Bellegarde. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nseem to be picking up the news by chance!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy suspense came to an end yesterday,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how long was mine to have lasted?\xe2\x80\x9d said the marquise to her\r\ndaughter. She spoke without irritation; with a sort of cold, noble\r\ndispleasure.\r\n\r\nMadame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 stood silent, with her eyes on the ground. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is over\r\nnow,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is my son\xe2\x80\x94where is Urbain?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the marquise. \xe2\x80\x9cSend for your\r\nbrother and inform him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYoung Madame de Bellegarde laid her hand on the bell-rope. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was to\r\nmake some visits with me, and I was to go and knock\xe2\x80\x94very softly, very\r\nsoftly\xe2\x80\x94at the door of his study. But he can come to me!\xe2\x80\x9d She pulled the\r\nbell, and in a few moments Mrs. Bread appeared, with a face of calm\r\ninquiry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSend for your brother,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old lady.\r\n\r\nBut Newman felt an irresistible impulse to speak, and to speak in a\r\ncertain way. \xe2\x80\x9cTell the marquis we want him,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Mrs. Bread, who\r\nquietly retired.\r\n\r\nYoung Madame de Bellegarde went to her sister-in-law and embraced her.\r\nThen she turned to Newman, with an intense smile. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is charming. I\r\ncongratulate you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI congratulate you, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de Bellegarde, with extreme\r\nsolemnity. \xe2\x80\x9cMy daughter is an extraordinarily good woman. She may have\r\nfaults, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy mother does not often make jokes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9; \xe2\x80\x9cbut when\r\nshe does they are terrible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is ravishing,\xe2\x80\x9d the Marquise Urbain resumed, looking at her\r\nsister-in-law, with her head on one side. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I congratulate you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 turned away, and, taking up a piece of tapestry, began\r\nto ply the needle. Some minutes of silence elapsed, which were\r\ninterrupted by the arrival of M. de Bellegarde. He came in with his hat\r\nin his hand, gloved, and was followed by his brother Valentin, who\r\nappeared to have just entered the house. M. de Bellegarde looked around\r\nthe circle and greeted Newman with his usual finely-measured courtesy.\r\nValentin saluted his mother and his sisters, and, as he shook hands\r\nwith Newman, gave him a glance of acute interrogation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Arrivez donc, messieurs!_\xe2\x80\x9d cried young Madame de Bellegarde. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have\r\ngreat news for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak to your brother, my daughter,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old lady.\r\n\r\nMadame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 had been looking at her tapestry. She raised her eyes\r\nto her brother. \xe2\x80\x9cI have accepted Mr. Newman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour sister has consented,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see after all, I knew\r\nwhat I was about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am charmed!\xe2\x80\x9d said M. de Bellegarde, with superior benignity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo am I,\xe2\x80\x9d said Valentin to Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cThe marquis and I are charmed. I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t marry, myself, but I can understand it. I can\xe2\x80\x99t stand on my head,\r\nbut I can applaud a clever acrobat. My dear sister, I bless your\r\nunion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe marquis stood looking for a while into the crown of his hat. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\r\nhave been prepared,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last \xe2\x80\x9cbut it is inevitable that in face\r\nof the event one should experience a certain emotion.\xe2\x80\x9d And he gave a\r\nmost unhilarious smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI feel no emotion that I was not perfectly prepared for,\xe2\x80\x9d said his\r\nmother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t say that for myself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, smiling but differently\r\nfrom the marquis. \xe2\x80\x9cI am happier than I expected to be. I suppose it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe sight of your happiness!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t exaggerate that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de Bellegarde, getting up and\r\nlaying her hand upon her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s arm. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t expect an honest\r\nold woman to thank you for taking away her beautiful, only daughter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou forgot me, dear madame,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young marquise demurely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, she is very beautiful,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when is the wedding, pray?\xe2\x80\x9d asked young Madame de Bellegarde; \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nmust have a month to think over a dress.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat must be discussed,\xe2\x80\x9d said the marquise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, we will discuss it, and let you know!\xe2\x80\x9d Newman exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no doubt we shall agree,\xe2\x80\x9d said Urbain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you don\xe2\x80\x99t agree with Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9, you will be very\r\nunreasonable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come, Urbain,\xe2\x80\x9d said young Madame de Bellegarde, \xe2\x80\x9cI must go\r\nstraight to my tailor\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old lady had been standing with her hand on her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s arm,\r\nlooking at her fixedly. She gave a little sigh, and murmured, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\r\ndid _not_ expect it! You are a fortunate man,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, turning to\r\nNewman, with an expressive nod.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I know that!\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cI feel tremendously proud. I feel like\r\ncrying it on the housetops,\xe2\x80\x94like stopping people in the street to tell\r\nthem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame de Bellegarde narrowed her lips. \xe2\x80\x9cPray don\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe more people that know it, the better,\xe2\x80\x9d Newman declared. \xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyet announced it here, but I telegraphed it this morning to America.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTelegraphed it to America?\xe2\x80\x9d the old lady murmured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo New York, to St. Louis, and to San Francisco; those are the\r\nprincipal cities, you know. To-morrow I shall tell my friends here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you many?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Madame de Bellegarde, in a tone of which I am\r\nafraid that Newman but partly measured the impertinence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEnough to bring me a great many hand-shakes and congratulations. To\r\nsay nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, in a moment, \xe2\x80\x9cof those I shall receive from\r\nyour friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey will not use the telegraph,\xe2\x80\x9d said the marquise, taking her\r\ndeparture.\r\n\r\nM. de Bellegarde, whose wife, her imagination having apparently taken\r\nflight to the tailor\xe2\x80\x99s, was fluttering her silken wings in emulation,\r\nshook hands with Newman, and said with a more persuasive accent than\r\nthe latter had ever heard him use, \xe2\x80\x9cYou may count upon me.\xe2\x80\x9d Then his\r\nwife led him away.\r\n\r\nValentin stood looking from his sister to our hero. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope you both\r\nreflected seriously,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nMadame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have neither your powers of reflection nor\r\nyour depth of seriousness; but we have done our best.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I have a great regard for each of you,\xe2\x80\x9d Valentin continued. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nare charming young people. But I am not satisfied, on the whole, that\r\nyou belong to that small and superior class\xe2\x80\x94that exquisite group\r\ncomposed of persons who are worthy to remain unmarried. These are rare\r\nsouls; they are the salt of the earth. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to be\r\ninvidious; the marrying people are often very nice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cValentin holds that women should marry, and that men should not,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMadame de Cintr\xc3\xa9. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know how he arranges it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI arrange it by adoring you, my sister,\xe2\x80\x9d said Valentin ardently.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdore someone whom you can marry,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cI will arrange that\r\nfor you some day. I foresee that I am going to turn apostle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nValentin was on the threshold; he looked back a moment with a face that\r\nhad turned grave. \xe2\x80\x9cI adore someone I can\xe2\x80\x99t marry!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. And he\r\ndropped the _porti\xc3\xa8re_ and departed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey don\xe2\x80\x99t like it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, standing alone before Madame de\r\nCintr\xc3\xa9.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, after a moment; \xe2\x80\x9cthey don\xe2\x80\x99t like it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, now, do you mind that?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, after another interval.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a mistake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t help it. I should prefer that my mother were pleased.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy the deuce,\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Newman, \xe2\x80\x9cis she not pleased? She gave you\r\nleave to marry me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery true; I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand it. And yet I do \xe2\x80\x98mind it,\xe2\x80\x99 as you say.\r\nYou will call it superstitious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat will depend upon how much you let it bother you. Then I shall\r\ncall it an awful bore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will keep it to myself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9, \xe2\x80\x9cIt shall not bother\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d And then they talked of their marriage-day, and Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9\r\nassented unreservedly to Newman\xe2\x80\x99s desire to have it fixed for an early\r\ndate.\r\n\r\nNewman\xe2\x80\x99s telegrams were answered with interest. Having dispatched but\r\nthree electric missives, he received no less than eight gratulatory\r\nbulletins in return. He put them into his pocket-book, and the next\r\ntime he encountered old Madame de Bellegarde drew them forth and\r\ndisplayed them to her. This, it must be confessed, was a slightly\r\nmalicious stroke; the reader must judge in what degree the offense was\r\nvenial. Newman knew that the marquise disliked his telegrams, though he\r\ncould see no sufficient reason for it. Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9, on the other\r\nhand, liked them, and, most of them being of a humorous cast, laughed\r\nat them immoderately, and inquired into the character of their authors.\r\nNewman, now that his prize was gained, felt a peculiar desire that his\r\ntriumph should be manifest. He more than suspected that the Bellegardes\r\nwere keeping quiet about it, and allowing it, in their select circle,\r\nbut a limited resonance; and it pleased him to think that if he were to\r\ntake the trouble he might, as he phrased it, break all the windows. No\r\nman likes being repudiated, and yet Newman, if he was not flattered,\r\nwas not exactly offended. He had not this good excuse for his somewhat\r\naggressive impulse to promulgate his felicity; his sentiment was of\r\nanother quality. He wanted for once to make the heads of the house of\r\nBellegarde _feel_ him; he knew not when he should have another chance.\r\nHe had had for the past six months a sense of the old lady and her son\r\nlooking straight over his head, and he was now resolved that they\r\nshould toe a mark which he would give himself the satisfaction of\r\ndrawing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is like seeing a bottle emptied when the wine is poured too\r\nslowly,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Mrs. Tristram. \xe2\x80\x9cThey make me want to joggle their\r\nelbows and force them to spill their wine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo this Mrs. Tristram answered that he had better leave them alone and\r\nlet them do things in their own way. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must make allowances for\r\nthem,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is natural enough that they should hang fire a\r\nlittle. They thought they accepted you when you made your application;\r\nbut they are not people of imagination, they could not project\r\nthemselves into the future, and now they will have to begin again. But\r\nthey _are_ people of honor, and they will do whatever is necessary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman spent a few moments in narrow-eyed meditation. \xe2\x80\x9cI am not hard on\r\nthem,\xe2\x80\x9d he presently said, \xe2\x80\x9cand to prove it I will invite them all to a\r\nfestival.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo a festival?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have been laughing at my great gilded rooms all winter; I will\r\nshow you that they are good for something. I will give a party. What is\r\nthe grandest thing one can do here? I will hire all the great singers\r\nfrom the opera, and all the first people from the Th\xc3\xa9\xc3\xa2tre Fran\xc3\xa7ais, and\r\nI will give an entertainment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd whom will you invite?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou, first of all. And then the old lady and her son. And then\r\neveryone among her friends whom I have met at her house or elsewhere,\r\neveryone who has shown me the minimum of politeness, every duke of them\r\nand his wife. And then all my friends, without exception: Miss Kitty\r\nUpjohn, Miss Dora Finch, General Packard, C. P Hatch, and all the rest.\r\nAnd everyone shall know what it is about, that is, to celebrate my\r\nengagement to the Countess de Cintr\xc3\xa9. What do you think of the idea?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think it is odious!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Tristram. And then in a moment: \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nthink it is delicious!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe very next evening Newman repaired to Madame de Bellegarde\xe2\x80\x99s salon,\r\nwhere he found her surrounded by her children, and invited her to honor\r\nhis poor dwelling by her presence on a certain evening a fortnight\r\ndistant.\r\n\r\nThe marquise stared a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear sir,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat do you\r\nwant to do to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo make you acquainted with a few people, and then to place you in a\r\nvery easy chair and ask you to listen to Madame Frezzolini\xe2\x80\x99s singing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean to give a concert?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething of that sort.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd to have a crowd of people?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll my friends, and I hope some of yours and your daughter\xe2\x80\x99s. I want\r\nto celebrate my engagement.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Newman that Madame de Bellegarde turned pale. She opened\r\nher fan, a fine old painted fan of the last century, and looked at the\r\npicture, which represented a _f\xc3\xaate champ\xc3\xaatre_\xe2\x80\x94a lady with a guitar,\r\nsinging, and a group of dancers round a garlanded Hermes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe go out so little,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the marquis, \xe2\x80\x9csince my poor father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndeath.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut _my_ dear father is still alive, my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said his wife. \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\nonly waiting for my invitation to accept it,\xe2\x80\x9d and she glanced with\r\namiable confidence at Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will be magnificent; I am very sure\r\nof that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI am sorry to say, to the discredit of Newman\xe2\x80\x99s gallantry, that this\r\nlady\xe2\x80\x99s invitation was not then and there bestowed; he was giving all\r\nhis attention to the old marquise. She looked up at last, smiling. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t think of letting you offer me a f\xc3\xaate,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cuntil I have\r\noffered you one. We want to present you to our friends; we will invite\r\nthem all. We have it very much at heart. We must do things in order.\r\nCome to me about the 25th; I will let you know the exact day\r\nimmediately. We shall not have anyone so fine as Madame Frezzolini, but\r\nwe shall have some very good people. After that you may talk of your\r\nown f\xc3\xaate.\xe2\x80\x9d The old lady spoke with a certain quick eagerness, smiling\r\nmore agreeably as she went on.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Newman a handsome proposal, and such proposals always\r\ntouched the sources of his good-nature. He said to Madame de Bellegarde\r\nthat he should be glad to come on the 25th or any other day, and that\r\nit mattered very little whether he met his friends at her house or at\r\nhis own. I have said that Newman was observant, but it must be admitted\r\nthat on this occasion he failed to notice a certain delicate glance\r\nwhich passed between Madame de Bellegarde and the marquis, and which we\r\nmay presume to have been a commentary upon the innocence displayed in\r\nthat latter clause of his speech.\r\n\r\nValentin de Bellegarde walked away with Newman that evening, and when\r\nthey had left the Rue de l\xe2\x80\x99Universit\xc3\xa9 some distance behind them he said\r\nreflectively, \xe2\x80\x9cMy mother is very strong\xe2\x80\x94very strong.\xe2\x80\x9d Then in answer to\r\nan interrogative movement of Newman\xe2\x80\x99s he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cShe was driven to\r\nthe wall, but you would never have thought it. Her f\xc3\xaate of the 25th was\r\nan invention of the moment. She had no idea whatever of giving a f\xc3\xaate,\r\nbut finding it the only issue from your proposal, she looked straight\r\nat the dose\xe2\x80\x94excuse the expression\xe2\x80\x94and bolted it, as you saw, without\r\nwinking. She is very strong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear me!\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, divided between relish and compassion. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncare a straw for her f\xc3\xaate, I am willing to take the will for the deed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Valentin, with a little inconsequent touch of family\r\npride. \xe2\x80\x9cThe thing will be done now, and done handsomely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n\r\nValentin de Bellegarde\xe2\x80\x99s announcement of the secession of Mademoiselle\r\nNioche from her father\xe2\x80\x99s domicile and his irreverent reflections upon\r\nthe attitude of this anxious parent in so grave a catastrophe, received\r\na practical commentary in the fact that M. Nioche was slow to seek\r\nanother interview with his late pupil. It had cost Newman some disgust\r\nto be forced to assent to Valentin\xe2\x80\x99s somewhat cynical interpretation of\r\nthe old man\xe2\x80\x99s philosophy, and, though circumstances seemed to indicate\r\nthat he had not given himself up to a noble despair, Newman thought it\r\nvery possible he might be suffering more keenly than was apparent. M.\r\nNioche had been in the habit of paying him a respectful little visit\r\nevery two or three weeks and his absence might be a proof quite as much\r\nof extreme depression as of a desire to conceal the success with which\r\nhe had patched up his sorrow. Newman presently learned from Valentin\r\nseveral details touching this new phase of Mademoiselle No\xc3\xa9mie\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncareer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told you she was remarkable,\xe2\x80\x9d this unshrinking observer declared,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand the way she has managed this performance proves it. She has had\r\nother chances, but she was resolved to take none but the best. She did\r\nyou the honor to think for a while that you might be such a chance. You\r\nwere not; so she gathered up her patience and waited a while longer. At\r\nlast her occasion came along, and she made her move with her eyes wide\r\nopen. I am very sure she had no innocence to lose, but she had all her\r\nrespectability. Dubious little damsel as you thought her, she had kept\r\na firm hold of that; nothing could be proved against her, and she was\r\ndetermined not to let her reputation go till she had got her\r\nequivalent. About her equivalent she had high ideas. Apparently her\r\nideal has been satisfied. It is fifty years old, bald-headed, and deaf,\r\nbut it is very easy about money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd where in the world,\xe2\x80\x9d asked Newman, \xe2\x80\x9cdid you pick up this valuable\r\ninformation?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn conversation. Remember my frivolous habits. In conversation with a\r\nyoung woman engaged in the humble trade of glove-cleaner, who keeps a\r\nsmall shop in the Rue St. Roch. M. Nioche lives in the same house, up\r\nsix pair of stairs, across the court, in and out of whose ill-swept\r\ndoorway Miss No\xc3\xa9mie has been flitting for the last five years. The\r\nlittle glove-cleaner was an old acquaintance; she used to be the friend\r\nof a friend of mine, who has married and dropped such friends. I often\r\nsaw her in his society. As soon as I espied her behind her clear little\r\nwindow-pane, I recollected her. I had on a spotlessly fresh pair of\r\ngloves, but I went in and held up my hands, and said to her, \xe2\x80\x98Dear\r\nmademoiselle, what will you ask me for cleaning these?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Dear count,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nshe answered immediately, \xe2\x80\x98I will clean them for you for nothing.\xe2\x80\x99 She\r\nhad instantly recognized me, and I had to hear her history for the last\r\nsix years. But after that, I put her upon that of her neighbors. She\r\nknows and admires No\xc3\xa9mie, and she told me what I have just repeated.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA month elapsed without M. Nioche reappearing, and Newman, who every\r\nmorning read two or three suicides in the _Figaro_, began to suspect\r\nthat, mortification proving stubborn, he had sought a balm for his\r\nwounded pride in the waters of the Seine. He had a note of M. Nioche\xe2\x80\x99s\r\naddress in his pocket-book, and finding himself one day in the\r\n_quartier_, he determined, in so far as he might, to clear up his\r\ndoubts. He repaired to the house in the Rue St. Roch which bore the\r\nrecorded number, and observed in a neighboring basement, behind a\r\ndangling row of neatly inflated gloves, the attentive physiognomy of\r\nBellegarde\xe2\x80\x99s informant\xe2\x80\x94a sallow person in a dressing-gown\xe2\x80\x94peering into\r\nthe street as if she were expecting that amiable nobleman to pass\r\nagain. But it was not to her that Newman applied; he simply asked of\r\nthe portress if M. Nioche were at home. The portress replied, as the\r\nportress invariably replies, that her lodger had gone out barely three\r\nminutes before; but then, through the little square hole of her\r\nlodge-window taking the measure of Newman\xe2\x80\x99s fortunes, and seeing them,\r\nby an unspecified process, refresh the dry places of servitude to\r\noccupants of fifth floors on courts, she added that M. Nioche would\r\nhave had just time to reach the Caf\xc3\xa9 de la Patrie, round the second\r\ncorner to the left, at which establishment he regularly spent his\r\nafternoons. Newman thanked her for the information, took the second\r\nturning to the left, and arrived at the Caf\xc3\xa9 de la Patrie. He felt a\r\nmomentary hesitation to go in; was it not rather mean to \xe2\x80\x9cfollow up\xe2\x80\x9d\r\npoor old Nioche at that rate? But there passed across his vision an\r\nimage of a haggard little septuagenarian taking measured sips of a\r\nglass of sugar and water and finding them quite impotent to sweeten his\r\ndesolation. He opened the door and entered, perceiving nothing at first\r\nbut a dense cloud of tobacco smoke. Across this, however, in a corner,\r\nhe presently descried the figure of M. Nioche, stirring the contents of\r\na deep glass, with a lady seated in front of him. The lady\xe2\x80\x99s back was\r\nturned to Newman, but M. Nioche very soon perceived and recognized his\r\nvisitor. Newman had gone toward him, and the old man rose slowly,\r\ngazing at him with a more blighted expression even than usual.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you are drinking hot punch,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you are not\r\ndead. That\xe2\x80\x99s all right. Don\xe2\x80\x99t move.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. Nioche stood staring, with a fallen jaw, not daring to put out his\r\nhand. The lady, who sat facing him, turned round in her place and\r\nglanced upward with a spirited toss of her head, displaying the\r\nagreeable features of his daughter. She looked at Newman sharply, to\r\nsee how he was looking at her, then\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what she\r\ndiscovered\xe2\x80\x94she said graciously, \xe2\x80\x9cHow d\xe2\x80\x99 ye do, monsieur? won\xe2\x80\x99t you come\r\ninto our little corner?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you come\xe2\x80\x94did you come after _me?_\xe2\x80\x9d asked M. Nioche very softly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI went to your house to see what had become of you. I thought you\r\nmight be sick,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is very good of you, as always,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I am not\r\nwell. Yes, I am _seek_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsk monsieur to sit down,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mademoiselle Nioche. \xe2\x80\x9cGar\xc3\xa7on, bring a\r\nchair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you do us the honor to _seat?_\xe2\x80\x9d said M. Nioche, timorously, and\r\nwith a double foreignness of accent.\r\n\r\nNewman said to himself that he had better see the thing out and he took\r\na chair at the end of the table, with Mademoiselle Nioche on his left\r\nand her father on the other side. \xe2\x80\x9cYou will take something, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Miss No\xc3\xa9mie, who was sipping a glass of madeira. Newman said that\r\nhe believed not, and then she turned to her papa with a smile. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat an\r\nhonor, eh? he has come only for us.\xe2\x80\x9d M. Nioche drained his pungent\r\nglass at a long draught, and looked out from eyes more lachrymose in\r\nconsequence. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you didn\xe2\x80\x99t come for me, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d Mademoiselle No\xc3\xa9mie went\r\non. \xe2\x80\x9cYou didn\xe2\x80\x99t expect to find me here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman observed the change in her appearance. She was very elegant and\r\nprettier than before; she looked a year or two older, and it was\r\nnoticeable that, to the eye, she had only gained in respectability. She\r\nlooked \xe2\x80\x9clady-like.\xe2\x80\x9d She was dressed in quiet colors, and wore her\r\nexpensively unobtrusive toilet with a grace that might have come from\r\nyears of practice. Her present self-possession and _aplomb_ struck\r\nNewman as really infernal, and he inclined to agree with Valentin de\r\nBellegarde that the young lady was very remarkable. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, to tell the\r\ntruth, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t come for you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand I didn\xe2\x80\x99t expect to find\r\nyou. I was told,\xe2\x80\x9d he added in a moment \xe2\x80\x9cthat you had left your father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Quelle horreur!_\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mademoiselle Nioche with a smile. \xe2\x80\x9cDoes one\r\nleave one\xe2\x80\x99s father? You have the proof of the contrary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, convincing proof,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman glancing at M. Nioche. The old man\r\ncaught his glance obliquely, with his faded, deprecating eye, and then,\r\nlifting his empty glass, pretended to drink again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho told you that?\xe2\x80\x9d No\xc3\xa9mie demanded. \xe2\x80\x9cI know very well. It was M. de\r\nBellegarde. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you say yes? You are not polite.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am embarrassed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI set you a better example. I know M. de Bellegarde told you. He knows\r\na great deal about me\xe2\x80\x94or he thinks he does. He has taken a great deal\r\nof trouble to find out, but half of it isn\xe2\x80\x99t true. In the first place,\r\nI haven\xe2\x80\x99t left my father; I am much too fond of him. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it so,\r\nlittle father? M. de Bellegarde is a charming young man; it is\r\nimpossible to be cleverer. I know a good deal about him too; you can\r\ntell him that when you next see him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, with a sturdy grin; \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t carry any messages for\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust as you please,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mademoiselle Nioche, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t depend upon\r\nyou, nor does M. de Bellegarde either. He is very much interested in\r\nme; he can be left to his own devices. He is a contrast to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, he is a great contrast to me, I have no doubt\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t exactly know how you mean it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean it in this way. First of all, he never offered to help me to a\r\n_dot_ and a husband.\xe2\x80\x9d And Mademoiselle Nioche paused, smiling. \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsay that is in his favor, for I do you justice. What led you, by the\r\nway, to make me such a queer offer? You didn\xe2\x80\x99t care for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, I did,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would have given me real pleasure to see you married to a\r\nrespectable young fellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith six thousand francs of income!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mademoiselle Nioche. \xe2\x80\x9cDo\r\nyou call that caring for me? I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid you know little about women.\r\nYou were not _galant_; you were not what you might have been.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman flushed a trifle fiercely. \xe2\x80\x9cCome!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s rather\r\nstrong. I had no idea I had been so shabby.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Nioche smiled as she took up her muff. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is something,\r\nat any rate, to have made you angry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer father had leaned both his elbows on the table, and his head, bent\r\nforward, was supported in his hands, the thin white fingers of which\r\nwere pressed over his ears. In his position he was staring fixedly at\r\nthe bottom of his empty glass, and Newman supposed he was not hearing.\r\nMademoiselle No\xc3\xa9mie buttoned her furred jacket and pushed back her\r\nchair, casting a glance charged with the consciousness of an expensive\r\nappearance first down over her flounces and then up at Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had better have remained an honest girl,\xe2\x80\x9d Newman said quietly.\r\n\r\nM. Nioche continued to stare at the bottom of his glass, and his\r\ndaughter got up, still bravely smiling. \xe2\x80\x9cYou mean that I look so much\r\nlike one? That\xe2\x80\x99s more than most women do nowadays. Don\xe2\x80\x99t judge me yet\r\nawhile,\xe2\x80\x9d she added. \xe2\x80\x9cI mean to succeed; that\xe2\x80\x99s what I mean to do. I\r\nleave you; I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to be seen in caf\xc3\xa9s, for one thing. I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink what you want of my poor father; he\xe2\x80\x99s very comfortable now. It\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t his fault, either. _Au revoir_, little father.\xe2\x80\x9d And she tapped\r\nthe old man on the head with her muff. Then she stopped a minute,\r\nlooking at Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cTell M. de Bellegarde, when he wants news of me, to\r\ncome and get it from _me!_\xe2\x80\x9d And she turned and departed, the\r\nwhite-aproned waiter, with a bow, holding the door wide open for her.\r\n\r\nM. Nioche sat motionless, and Newman hardly knew what to say to him.\r\nThe old man looked dismally foolish. \xe2\x80\x9cSo you determined not to shoot\r\nher, after all,\xe2\x80\x9d Newman said presently.\r\n\r\nM. Nioche, without moving, raised his eyes and gave him a long,\r\npeculiar look. It seemed to confess everything, and yet not to ask for\r\npity, nor to pretend, on the other hand, to a rugged ability to do\r\nwithout it. It might have expressed the state of mind of an innocuous\r\ninsect, flat in shape and conscious of the impending pressure of a\r\nboot-sole, and reflecting that he was perhaps too flat to be crushed.\r\nM. Nioche\xe2\x80\x99s gaze was a profession of moral flatness. \xe2\x80\x9cYou despise me\r\nterribly,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in the weakest possible voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, \xe2\x80\x9cit is none of my business. It\xe2\x80\x99s a good plan to\r\ntake things easily.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI made you too many fine speeches,\xe2\x80\x9d M. Nioche added. \xe2\x80\x9cI meant them at\r\nthe time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sure I am very glad you didn\xe2\x80\x99t shoot her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cI was\r\nafraid you might have shot yourself. That is why I came to look you\r\nup.\xe2\x80\x9d And he began to button his coat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNeither,\xe2\x80\x9d said M. Nioche. \xe2\x80\x9cYou despise me, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t explain to you.\r\nI hoped I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t see you again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, that\xe2\x80\x99s rather shabby,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cYou shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t drop your\r\nfriends that way. Besides, the last time you came to see me I thought\r\nyou particularly jolly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I remember,\xe2\x80\x9d said M. Nioche musingly; \xe2\x80\x9cI was in a fever. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow what I said, what I did. It was delirium.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, well, you are quieter now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. Nioche was silent a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cAs quiet as the grave,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered\r\nsoftly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you very unhappy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. Nioche rubbed his forehead slowly, and even pushed back his wig a\r\nlittle, looking askance at his empty glass. \xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94yes. But that\xe2\x80\x99s an old\r\nstory. I have always been unhappy. My daughter does what she will with\r\nme. I take what she gives me, good or bad. I have no spirit, and when\r\nyou have no spirit you must keep quiet. I shan\xe2\x80\x99t trouble you any more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, rather disgusted at the smooth operation of the\r\nold man\xe2\x80\x99s philosophy, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s as you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. Nioche seemed to have been prepared to be despised but nevertheless\r\nhe made a feeble movement of appeal from Newman\xe2\x80\x99s faint praise. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter\r\nall,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cshe is my daughter, and I can still look after her. If\r\nshe will do wrong, why she will. But there are many different paths,\r\nthere are degrees. I can give her the benefit\xe2\x80\x94give her the benefit\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nM. Nioche paused, staring vaguely at Newman, who began to suspect that\r\nhis brain had softened\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthe benefit of my experience,\xe2\x80\x9d M. Nioche added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour experience?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Newman, both amused and amazed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy experience of business,\xe2\x80\x9d said M. Nioche, gravely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, laughing, \xe2\x80\x9cthat will be a great advantage to\r\nher!\xe2\x80\x9d And then he said good-bye, and offered the poor, foolish old man\r\nhis hand.\r\n\r\nM. Nioche took it and leaned back against the wall, holding it a moment\r\nand looking up at him. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you think my wits are going,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cVery likely; I have always a pain in my head. That\xe2\x80\x99s why I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nexplain, I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you. And she\xe2\x80\x99s so strong, she makes me walk as\r\nshe will, anywhere! But there\xe2\x80\x99s this\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s this.\xe2\x80\x9d And he stopped,\r\nstill staring up at Newman. His little white eyes expanded and\r\nglittered for a moment like those of a cat in the dark. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not as it\r\nseems. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t forgiven her. Oh, no!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s right; don\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s a bad case.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s horrible, it\xe2\x80\x99s horrible,\xe2\x80\x9d said M. Nioche; \xe2\x80\x9cbut do you want to\r\nknow the truth? I hate her! I take what she gives me, and I hate her\r\nmore. To-day she brought me three hundred francs; they are here in my\r\nwaistcoat pocket. Now I hate her almost cruelly. No, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t forgiven\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you accept the money?\xe2\x80\x9d Newman asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said M. Nioche, \xe2\x80\x9cI should have hated her still more.\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s what misery is. No, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t forgiven her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake care you don\xe2\x80\x99t hurt her!\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, laughing again. And with\r\nthis he took his leave. As he passed along the glazed side of the caf\xc3\xa9,\r\non reaching the street, he saw the old man motioning the waiter, with a\r\nmelancholy gesture, to replenish his glass.\r\n\r\nOne day, a week after his visit to the Caf\xc3\xa9 de la Patrie, he called\r\nupon Valentin de Bellegarde, and by good fortune found him at home.\r\nNewman spoke of his interview with M. Nioche and his daughter, and said\r\nhe was afraid Valentin had judged the old man correctly. He had found\r\nthe couple hobnobbing together in all amity; the old gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s rigor\r\nwas purely theoretic. Newman confessed that he was disappointed; he\r\nshould have expected to see M. Nioche take high ground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHigh ground, my dear fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Valentin, laughing; \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no\r\nhigh ground for him to take. The only perceptible eminence in M.\r\nNioche\xe2\x80\x99s horizon is Montmartre, which is not an edifying quarter. You\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t go mountaineering in a flat country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe remarked, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he has not forgiven her. But\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99ll never find it out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must do him the justice to suppose he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like the thing,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nValentin rejoined. \xe2\x80\x9cMademoiselle Nioche is like the great artists whose\r\nbiographies we read, who at the beginning of their career have suffered\r\nopposition in the domestic circle. Their vocation has not been\r\nrecognized by their families, but the world has done it justice.\r\nMademoiselle Nioche has a vocation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, come,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, impatiently, \xe2\x80\x9cyou take the little baggage too\r\nseriously.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know I do; but when one has nothing to think about, one must think\r\nof little baggages. I suppose it is better to be serious about light\r\nthings than not to be serious at all. This little baggage entertains\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, she has discovered that. She knows you have been hunting her up\r\nand asking questions about her. She is very much tickled by it. That\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrather annoying.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnnoying, my dear fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d laughed Valentin; \xe2\x80\x9cnot the least!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHanged if I should want to have a greedy little adventuress like that\r\nknow I was giving myself such pains about her!\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA pretty woman is always worth one\xe2\x80\x99s pains,\xe2\x80\x9d objected Valentin.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMademoiselle Nioche is welcome to be tickled by my curiosity, and to\r\nknow that I am tickled that she is tickled. She is not so much tickled,\r\nby the way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had better go and tell her,\xe2\x80\x9d Newman rejoined. \xe2\x80\x9cShe gave me a\r\nmessage for you of some such drift.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBless your quiet imagination,\xe2\x80\x9d said Valentin, \xe2\x80\x9cI have been to see\r\nher\xe2\x80\x94three times in five days. She is a charming hostess; we talk of\r\nShakespeare and the musical glasses. She is extremely clever and a very\r\ncurious type; not at all coarse or wanting to be coarse; determined not\r\nto be. She means to take very good care of herself. She is extremely\r\nperfect; she is as hard and clear-cut as some little figure of a\r\nsea-nymph in an antique intaglio, and I will warrant that she has not a\r\ngrain more of sentiment or heart than if she was scooped out of a big\r\namethyst. You can\xe2\x80\x99t scratch her even with a diamond. Extremely\r\npretty,\xe2\x80\x94really, when you know her, she is wonderfully\r\npretty,\xe2\x80\x94intelligent, determined, ambitious, unscrupulous, capable of\r\nlooking at a man strangled without changing color, she is upon my\r\nhonor, extremely entertaining.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a fine list of attractions,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman; \xe2\x80\x9cthey would serve as a\r\npolice-detective\xe2\x80\x99s description of a favorite criminal. I should sum\r\nthem up by another word than \xe2\x80\x98entertaining.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, that is just the word to use. I don\xe2\x80\x99t say she is laudable or\r\nlovable. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want her as my wife or my sister. But she is a very\r\ncurious and ingenious piece of machinery; I like to see it in\r\noperation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I have seen some very curious machines too,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman; \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nonce, in a needle factory, I saw a gentleman from the city, who had\r\nstopped too near one of them, picked up as neatly as if he had been\r\nprodded by a fork, swallowed down straight, and ground into small\r\npieces.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRe-entering his domicile, late in the evening, three days after Madame\r\nde Bellegarde had made her bargain with him\xe2\x80\x94the expression is\r\nsufficiently correct\xe2\x80\x94touching the entertainment at which she was to\r\npresent him to the world, he found on his table a card of goodly\r\ndimensions bearing an announcement that this lady would be at home on\r\nthe 27th of the month, at ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the evening. He stuck it into\r\nthe frame of his mirror and eyed it with some complacency; it seemed an\r\nagreeable emblem of triumph, documentary evidence that his prize was\r\ngained. Stretched out in a chair, he was looking at it lovingly, when\r\nValentin de Bellegarde was shown into the room. Valentin\xe2\x80\x99s glance\r\npresently followed the direction of Newman\xe2\x80\x99s, and he perceived his\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s invitation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what have they put into the corner?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cNot the customary\r\n\xe2\x80\x98music,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98dancing,\xe2\x80\x99 or _\xe2\x80\x98tableaux vivants\xe2\x80\x99?_ They ought at least to put\r\n\xe2\x80\x98An American.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, there are to be several of us,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Tristram told\r\nme to-day that she had received a card and sent an acceptance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, then, with Mrs. Tristram and her husband you will have support. My\r\nmother might have put on her card \xe2\x80\x98Three Americans.\xe2\x80\x99 But I suspect you\r\nwill not lack amusement. You will see a great many of the best people\r\nin France. I mean the long pedigrees and the high noses, and all that.\r\nSome of them are awful idiots; I advise you to take them up\r\ncautiously.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I guess I shall like them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cI am prepared to like\r\nevery one and everything in these days; I am in high good-humor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nValentin looked at him a moment in silence and then dropped himself\r\ninto a chair with an unwonted air of weariness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHappy man!\xe2\x80\x9d he said with a sigh. \xe2\x80\x9cTake care you don\xe2\x80\x99t become\r\noffensive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf anyone chooses to take offense, he may. I have a good conscience,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you are really in love with my sister.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, after a pause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd she also?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI guess she likes me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the witchcraft you have used?\xe2\x80\x9d Valentin asked. \xe2\x80\x9cHow do _you_\r\nmake love?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t any general rules,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cIn any way that seems\r\nacceptable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suspect that, if one knew it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Valentin, laughing, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are a\r\nterrible customer. You walk in seven-league boots.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is something the matter with you to-night,\xe2\x80\x9d Newman said in\r\nresponse to this. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are vicious. Spare me all discordant sounds\r\nuntil after my marriage. Then, when I have settled down for life, I\r\nshall be better able to take things as they come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when does your marriage take place?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout six weeks hence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nValentin was silent a while, and then he said, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you feel very\r\nconfident about the future?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConfident. I knew what I wanted, exactly, and I know what I have got.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are sure you are going to be happy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure?\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cSo foolish a question deserves a foolish answer.\r\nYes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not afraid of anything?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat should I be afraid of? You can\xe2\x80\x99t hurt me unless you kill me by\r\nsome violent means. That I should indeed consider a tremendous sell. I\r\nwant to live and I mean to live. I can\xe2\x80\x99t die of illness, I am too\r\nridiculously tough; and the time for dying of old age won\xe2\x80\x99t come round\r\nyet a while. I can\xe2\x80\x99t lose my wife, I shall take too good care of her. I\r\nmay lose my money, or a large part of it; but that won\xe2\x80\x99t matter, for I\r\nshall make twice as much again. So what have I to be afraid of?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not afraid it may be rather a mistake for an American man of\r\nbusiness to marry a French countess?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the countess, possibly; but not for the man of business, if you\r\nmean me! But my countess shall not be disappointed; I answer for her\r\nhappiness!\xe2\x80\x9d And as if he felt the impulse to celebrate his happy\r\ncertitude by a bonfire, he got up to throw a couple of logs upon the\r\nalready blazing hearth. Valentin watched for a few moments the\r\nquickened flame, and then, with his head leaning on his hand, gave a\r\nmelancholy sigh. \xe2\x80\x9cGot a headache?\xe2\x80\x9d Newman asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Je suis triste_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Valentin, with Gallic simplicity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are sad, eh? It is about the lady you said the other night that\r\nyou adored and that you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t marry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid I really say that? It seemed to me afterwards that the words had\r\nescaped me. Before Claire it was bad taste. But I felt gloomy as I\r\nspoke, and I feel gloomy still. Why did you ever introduce me to that\r\ngirl?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s No\xc3\xa9mie, is it? Lord deliver us! You don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to say you are\r\nlovesick about her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLovesick, no; it\xe2\x80\x99s not a grand passion. But the cold-blooded little\r\ndemon sticks in my thoughts; she has bitten me with those even little\r\nteeth of hers; I feel as if I might turn rabid and do something crazy\r\nin consequence. It\xe2\x80\x99s very low, it\xe2\x80\x99s disgustingly low. She\xe2\x80\x99s the most\r\nmercenary little jade in Europe. Yet she really affects my peace of\r\nmind; she is always running in my head. It\xe2\x80\x99s a striking contrast to\r\nyour noble and virtuous attachment\xe2\x80\x94a vile contrast! It is rather\r\npitiful that it should be the best I am able to do for myself at my\r\npresent respectable age. I am a nice young man, eh, _en somme?_ You\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t warrant my future, as you do your own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDrop that girl, short,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman; \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t go near her again, and\r\nyour future will do. Come over to America and I will get you a place in\r\na bank.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is easy to say drop her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Valentin, with a light laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t drop a pretty woman like that. One must be polite, even with\r\nNo\xc3\xa9mie. Besides, I\xe2\x80\x99ll not have her suppose I am afraid of her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo, between politeness and vanity, you will get deeper into the mud?\r\nKeep them both for something better. Remember, too, that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want\r\nto introduce you to her; you insisted. I had a sort of uneasy feeling\r\nabout it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t reproach you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Valentin. \xe2\x80\x9cHeaven forbid! I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nfor the world have missed knowing her. She is really extraordinary. The\r\nway she has already spread her wings is amazing. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know when a\r\nwoman has amused me more. But excuse me,\xe2\x80\x9d he added in an instant; \xe2\x80\x9cshe\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t amuse you, at second hand, and the subject is an impure one.\r\nLet us talk of something else.\xe2\x80\x9d Valentin introduced another topic, but\r\nwithin five minutes Newman observed that, by a bold transition, he had\r\nreverted to Mademoiselle Nioche, and was giving pictures of her manners\r\nand quoting specimens of her _mots_. These were very witty, and, for a\r\nyoung woman who six months before had been painting the most artless\r\nmadonnas, startlingly cynical. But at last, abruptly, he stopped,\r\nbecame thoughtful, and for some time afterwards said nothing. When he\r\nrose to go it was evident that his thoughts were still running upon\r\nMademoiselle Nioche. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, she\xe2\x80\x99s a frightful little monster!\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next ten days were the happiest that Newman had ever known. He saw\r\nMadame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 every day, and never saw either old Madame de\r\nBellegarde or the elder of his prospective brothers-in-law. Madame de\r\nCintr\xc3\xa9 at last seemed to think it becoming to apologize for their never\r\nbeing present. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are much taken up,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cwith doing the\r\nhonors of Paris to Lord Deepmere.\xe2\x80\x9d There was a smile in her gravity as\r\nshe made this declaration, and it deepened as she added, \xe2\x80\x9cHe is our\r\nseventh cousin, you know, and blood is thicker than water. And then, he\r\nis so interesting!\xe2\x80\x9d And with this she laughed.\r\n\r\nNewman met young Madame de Bellegarde two or three times, always\r\nroaming about with graceful vagueness, as if in search of an\r\nunattainable ideal of amusement. She always reminded him of a painted\r\nperfume-bottle with a crack in it; but he had grown to have a kindly\r\nfeeling for her, based on the fact of her owing conjugal allegiance to\r\nUrbain de Bellegarde. He pitied M. de Bellegarde\xe2\x80\x99s wife, especially\r\nsince she was a silly, thirstily-smiling little brunette, with a\r\nsuggestion of an unregulated heart. The small marquise sometimes looked\r\nat him with an intensity too marked not to be innocent, for coquetry is\r\nmore finely shaded. She apparently wanted to ask him something or tell\r\nhim something; he wondered what it was. But he was shy of giving her an\r\nopportunity, because, if her communication bore upon the aridity of her\r\nmatrimonial lot, he was at a loss to see how he could help her. He had\r\na fancy, however, of her coming up to him some day and saying (after\r\nlooking around behind her) with a little passionate hiss, \xe2\x80\x9cI know you\r\ndetest my husband; let me have the pleasure of assuring you for once\r\nthat you are right. Pity a poor woman who is married to a clock-image\r\nin _papier-m\xc3\xa2ch\xc3\xa9!_\xe2\x80\x9d Possessing, however, in default of a competent\r\nknowledge of the principles of etiquette, a very downright sense of the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmeanness\xe2\x80\x9d of certain actions, it seemed to him to belong to his\r\nposition to keep on his guard; he was not going to put it into the\r\npower of these people to say that in their house he had done anything\r\nunpleasant. As it was, Madame de Bellegarde used to give him news of\r\nthe dress she meant to wear at his wedding, and which had not yet, in\r\nher creative imagination, in spite of many interviews with the tailor,\r\nresolved itself into its composite totality. \xe2\x80\x9cI told you pale blue bows\r\non the sleeves, at the elbows,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut to-day I don\xe2\x80\x99t see my\r\nblue bows at all. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what has become of them. To-day I see\r\npink\xe2\x80\x94a tender pink. And then I pass through strange, dull phases in\r\nwhich neither blue nor pink says anything to me. And yet I must have\r\nthe bows.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave them green or yellow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Malheureux!_\xe2\x80\x9d the little marquise would cry. \xe2\x80\x9cGreen bows would break\r\nyour marriage\xe2\x80\x94your children would be illegitimate!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 was calmly happy before the world, and Newman had the\r\nfelicity of fancying that before him, when the world was absent, she\r\nwas almost agitatedly happy. She said very tender things. \xe2\x80\x9cI take no\r\npleasure in you. You never give me a chance to scold you, to correct\r\nyou. I bargained for that, I expected to enjoy it. But you won\xe2\x80\x99t do\r\nanything dreadful; you are dismally inoffensive. It is very stupid;\r\nthere is no excitement for me; I might as well be marrying someone\r\nelse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid it\xe2\x80\x99s the worst I can do,\xe2\x80\x9d Newman would say in answer to\r\nthis. \xe2\x80\x9cKindly overlook the deficiency.\xe2\x80\x9d He assured her that he, at\r\nleast, would never scold her; she was perfectly satisfactory. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you\r\nonly knew,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9chow exactly you are what I coveted! And I am\r\nbeginning to understand why I coveted it; the having it makes all the\r\ndifference that I expected. Never was a man so pleased with his good\r\nfortune. You have been holding your head for a week past just as I\r\nwanted my wife to hold hers. You say just the things I want her to say.\r\nYou walk about the room just as I want her to walk. You have just the\r\ntaste in dress that I want her to have. In short, you come up to the\r\nmark, and, I can tell you, my mark was high.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese observations seemed to make Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 rather grave. At\r\nlast she said, \xe2\x80\x9cDepend upon it, I don\xe2\x80\x99t come up to the mark; your mark\r\nis too high. I am not all that you suppose; I am a much smaller affair.\r\nShe is a magnificent woman, your ideal. Pray, how did she come to such\r\nperfection?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was never anything else,\xe2\x80\x9d Newman said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI really believe,\xe2\x80\x9d Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 went on, \xe2\x80\x9cthat she is better than\r\nmy own ideal. Do you know that is a very handsome compliment? Well,\r\nsir, I will make her my own!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Tristram came to see her dear Claire after Newman had announced\r\nhis engagement, and she told our hero the next day that his good\r\nfortune was simply absurd. \xe2\x80\x9cFor the ridiculous part of it is,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you are evidently going to be as happy as if you were\r\nmarrying Miss Smith or Miss Thompson. I call it a brilliant match for\r\nyou, but you get brilliancy without paying any tax upon it. Those\r\nthings are usually a compromise, but here you have everything, and\r\nnothing crowds anything else out. You will be brilliantly happy as\r\nwell.\xe2\x80\x9d Newman thanked her for her pleasant, encouraging way of saying\r\nthings; no woman could encourage or discourage better. Tristram\xe2\x80\x99s way\r\nof saying things was different; he had been taken by his wife to call\r\nupon Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9, and he gave an account of the expedition.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t catch me giving an opinion on your countess this time,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid; \xe2\x80\x9cI put my foot in it once. That\xe2\x80\x99s a d\xe2\x80\x94d underhand thing to do, by\r\nthe way\xe2\x80\x94coming round to sound a fellow upon the woman you are going to\r\nmarry. You deserve anything you get. Then of course you rush and tell\r\nher, and she takes care to make it pleasant for the poor spiteful\r\nwretch the first time he calls. I will do you the justice to say,\r\nhowever, that you don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to have told Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9; or if you\r\nhave, she\xe2\x80\x99s uncommonly magnanimous. She was very nice; she was\r\ntremendously polite. She and Lizzie sat on the sofa, pressing each\r\nother\xe2\x80\x99s hands and calling each other _ch\xc3\xa8re belle_, and Madame de\r\nCintr\xc3\xa9 sent me with every third word a magnificent smile, as if to give\r\nme to understand that I too was a handsome dear. She quite made up for\r\npast neglect, I assure you; she was very pleasant and sociable. Only in\r\nan evil hour it came into her head to say that she must present us to\r\nher mother\xe2\x80\x94her mother wished to know your friends. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to\r\nknow her mother, and I was on the point of telling Lizzie to go in\r\nalone and let me wait for her outside. But Lizzie, with her usual\r\ninfernal ingenuity, guessed my purpose and reduced me by a glance of\r\nher eye. So they marched off arm in arm, and I followed as I could. We\r\nfound the old lady in her armchair, twiddling her aristocratic thumbs.\r\nShe looked at Lizzie from head to foot; but at that game Lizzie, to do\r\nher justice, was a match for her. My wife told her we were great\r\nfriends of Mr. Newman. The marquise started a moment, and then said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, Mr. Newman! My daughter has made up her mind to marry a Mr.\r\nNewman.\xe2\x80\x99 Then Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 began to fondle Lizzie again, and said\r\nit was this dear lady that had planned the match and brought them\r\ntogether. \xe2\x80\x98Oh, \xe2\x80\x98tis you I have to thank for my American son-in-law,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthe old lady said to Mrs. Tristram. \xe2\x80\x98It was a very clever thought of\r\nyours. Be sure of my gratitude.\xe2\x80\x99 And then she began to look at me and\r\npresently said, \xe2\x80\x98Pray, are you engaged in some species of manufacture?\xe2\x80\x99\r\nI wanted to say that I manufactured broom-sticks for old witches to\r\nride on, but Lizzie got in ahead of me. \xe2\x80\x98My husband, Madame la\r\nMarquise,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98belongs to that unfortunate class of persons who\r\nhave no profession and no business, and do very little good in the\r\nworld.\xe2\x80\x99 To get her poke at the old woman she didn\xe2\x80\x99t care where she\r\nshoved me. \xe2\x80\x98Dear me,\xe2\x80\x99 said the marquise, \xe2\x80\x98we all have our duties.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nam sorry mine compel me to take leave of you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lizzie. And we\r\nbundled out again. But you have a mother-in-law, in all the force of\r\nthe term.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, \xe2\x80\x9cmy mother-in-law desires nothing better than to let\r\nme alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBetimes, on the evening of the 27th, he went to Madame de Bellegarde\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nball. The old house in the Rue de l\xe2\x80\x99Universit\xc3\xa9 looked strangely\r\nbrilliant. In the circle of light projected from the outer gate a\r\ndetachment of the populace stood watching the carriages roll in; the\r\ncourt was illumined with flaring torches and the portico carpeted with\r\ncrimson. When Newman arrived there were but a few people present. The\r\nmarquise and her two daughters were at the top of the staircase, where\r\nthe sallow old nymph in the angle peeped out from a bower of plants.\r\nMadame de Bellegarde, in purple and fine laces, looked like an old lady\r\npainted by Vandyke; Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 was dressed in white. The old lady\r\ngreeted Newman with majestic formality, and looking round her, called\r\nseveral of the persons who were standing near. They were elderly\r\ngentlemen, of what Valentin de Bellegarde had designated as the\r\nhigh-nosed category; two or three of them wore cordons and stars. They\r\napproached with measured alertness, and the marquise said that she\r\nwished to present them to Mr. Newman, who was going to marry her\r\ndaughter. Then she introduced successively three dukes, three counts,\r\nand a baron. These gentlemen bowed and smiled most agreeably, and\r\nNewman indulged in a series of impartial hand-shakes, accompanied by a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHappy to make your acquaintance, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d He looked at Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9,\r\nbut she was not looking at him. If his personal self-consciousness had\r\nbeen of a nature to make him constantly refer to her, as the critic\r\nbefore whom, in company, he played his part, he might have found it a\r\nflattering proof of her confidence that he never caught her eyes\r\nresting upon him. It is a reflection Newman did not make, but we\r\nnevertheless risk it, that in spite of this circumstance she probably\r\nsaw every movement of his little finger. Young Madame de Bellegarde was\r\ndressed in an audacious toilet of crimson crape, bestrewn with huge\r\nsilver moons\xe2\x80\x94thin crescent and full disks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t say anything about my dress,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI feel,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, \xe2\x80\x9cas if I were looking at you through a\r\ntelescope. It is very strange.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it is strange it matches the occasion. But I am not a heavenly\r\nbody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never saw the sky at midnight that particular shade of crimson,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is my originality; anyone could have chosen blue. My\r\nsister-in-law would have chosen a lovely shade of blue, with a dozen\r\nlittle delicate moons. But I think crimson is much more amusing. And I\r\ngive my idea, which is moonshine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMoonshine and bloodshed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA murder by moonlight,\xe2\x80\x9d laughed Madame de Bellegarde. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a\r\ndelicious idea for a toilet! To make it complete, there is the silver\r\ndagger, you see, stuck into my hair. But here comes Lord Deepmere,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nadded in a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cI must find out what he thinks of it.\xe2\x80\x9d Lord\r\nDeepmere came up, looking very red in the face, and laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cLord\r\nDeepmere can\xe2\x80\x99t decide which he prefers, my sister-in-law or me,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMadame de Bellegarde. \xe2\x80\x9cHe likes Claire because she is his cousin, and\r\nme because I am not. But he has no right to make love to Claire,\r\nwhereas I am perfectly _disponible_. It is very wrong to make love to a\r\nwoman who is engaged, but it is very wrong not to make love to a woman\r\nwho is married.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s very jolly making love to married women,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lord Deepmere,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbecause they can\xe2\x80\x99t ask you to marry them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that what the others do, the spinsters?\xe2\x80\x9d Newman inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh dear, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lord Deepmere; \xe2\x80\x9cin England all the girls ask a\r\nfellow to marry them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd a fellow brutally refuses,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de Bellegarde.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, really, you know, a fellow can\xe2\x80\x99t marry any girl that asks him,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid his lordship.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour cousin won\xe2\x80\x99t ask you. She is going to marry Mr. Newman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that\xe2\x80\x99s a very different thing!\xe2\x80\x9d laughed Lord Deepmere.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou would have accepted _her_, I suppose. That makes me hope that\r\nafter all you prefer me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, when things are nice I never prefer one to the other,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nyoung Englishman. \xe2\x80\x9cI take them all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, what a horror! I won\xe2\x80\x99t be taken in that way; I must be kept\r\napart,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Madame de Bellegarde. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Newman is much better; he\r\nknows how to choose. Oh, he chooses as if he were threading a needle.\r\nHe prefers Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 to any conceivable creature or thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you can\xe2\x80\x99t help my being her cousin,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lord Deepmere to\r\nNewman, with candid hilarity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, I can\xe2\x80\x99t help that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, laughing back; \xe2\x80\x9cneither can\r\nshe!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you can\xe2\x80\x99t help my dancing with her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lord Deepmere, with\r\nsturdy simplicity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could prevent that only by dancing with her myself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut unfortunately I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to dance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you may dance without knowing how; may you not, milord?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMadame de Bellegarde. But to this Lord Deepmere replied that a fellow\r\nought to know how to dance if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to make an ass of himself;\r\nand at this moment Urbain de Bellegarde joined the group, slow-stepping\r\nand with his hands behind him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a very splendid entertainment,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, cheerfully. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nold house looks very bright.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf _you_ are pleased, we are content,\xe2\x80\x9d said the marquis, lifting his\r\nshoulders and bending them forward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I suspect everyone is pleased,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cHow can they help\r\nbeing pleased when the first thing they see as they come in is your\r\nsister, standing there as beautiful as an angel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, she is very beautiful,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the marquis, solemnly. \xe2\x80\x9cBut that\r\nis not so great a source of satisfaction to other people, naturally, as\r\nto you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I am satisfied, marquis, I am satisfied,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, with his\r\nprotracted enunciation. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd now tell me,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, looking round,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwho some of your friends are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. de Bellegarde looked about him in silence, with his head bent and\r\nhis hand raised to his lower lip, which he slowly rubbed. A stream of\r\npeople had been pouring into the salon in which Newman stood with his\r\nhost, the rooms were filling up and the spectacle had become brilliant.\r\nIt borrowed its splendor chiefly from the shining shoulders and profuse\r\njewels of the women, and from the voluminous elegance of their dresses.\r\nThere were no uniforms, as Madame de Bellegarde\xe2\x80\x99s door was inexorably\r\nclosed against the myrmidons of the upstart power which then ruled the\r\nfortunes of France, and the great company of smiling and chattering\r\nfaces was not graced by any very frequent suggestions of harmonious\r\nbeauty. It is a pity, nevertheless, that Newman had not been a\r\nphysiognomist, for a great many of the faces were irregularly\r\nagreeable, expressive, and suggestive. If the occasion had been\r\ndifferent they would hardly have pleased him; he would have thought the\r\nwomen not pretty enough and the men too smirking; but he was now in a\r\nhumor to receive none but agreeable impressions, and he looked no more\r\nnarrowly than to perceive that everyone was brilliant, and to feel that\r\nthe sun of their brilliancy was a part of his credit. \xe2\x80\x9cI will present\r\nyou to some people,\xe2\x80\x9d said M. de Bellegarde after a while. \xe2\x80\x9cI will make\r\na point of it, in fact. You will allow me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I will shake hands with anyone you want,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cYour\r\nmother just introduced me to half a dozen old gentlemen. Take care you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t pick up the same parties again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho are the gentlemen to whom my mother presented you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my word, I forgot them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cThe people here\r\nlook very much alike.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suspect they have not forgotten you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the marquis. And he began\r\nto walk through the rooms. Newman, to keep near him in the crowd, took\r\nhis arm; after which for some time, the marquis walked straight along,\r\nin silence. At last, reaching the farther end of the suite of\r\nreception-rooms, Newman found himself in the presence of a lady of\r\nmonstrous proportions, seated in a very capacious armchair, with\r\nseveral persons standing in a semicircle round her. This little group\r\nhad divided as the marquis came up, and M. de Bellegarde stepped\r\nforward and stood for an instant silent and obsequious, with his hat\r\nraised to his lips, as Newman had seen some gentlemen stand in churches\r\nas soon as they entered their pews. The lady, indeed, bore a very fair\r\nlikeness to a reverend effigy in some idolatrous shrine. She was\r\nmonumentally stout and imperturbably serene. Her aspect was to Newman\r\nalmost formidable; he had a troubled consciousness of a triple chin, a\r\nsmall piercing eye, a vast expanse of uncovered bosom, a nodding and\r\ntwinkling tiara of plumes and gems, and an immense circumference of\r\nsatin petticoat. With her little circle of beholders this remarkable\r\nwoman reminded him of the Fat Lady at a fair. She fixed her small,\r\nunwinking eyes at the new-comers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear duchess,\xe2\x80\x9d said the marquis, \xe2\x80\x9clet me present you our good friend\r\nMr. Newman, of whom you have heard us speak. Wishing to make Mr. Newman\r\nknown to those who are dear to us, I could not possibly fail to begin\r\nwith you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCharmed, dear friend; charmed, monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d said the duchess in a voice\r\nwhich, though small and shrill, was not disagreeable, while Newman\r\nexecuted his obeisance. \xe2\x80\x9cI came on purpose to see monsieur. I hope he\r\nappreciates the compliment. You have only to look at me to do so, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe continued, sweeping her person with a much-encompassing glance.\r\nNewman hardly knew what to say, though it seemed that to a duchess who\r\njoked about her corpulence one might say almost anything. On hearing\r\nthat the duchess had come on purpose to see Newman, the gentlemen who\r\nsurrounded her turned a little and looked at him with sympathetic\r\ncuriosity. The marquis with supernatural gravity mentioned to him the\r\nname of each, while the gentleman who bore it bowed; they were all what\r\nare called in France _beaux noms_. \xe2\x80\x9cI wanted extremely to see you,\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\nduchess went on. \xe2\x80\x9c_C\xe2\x80\x99est positif_. In the first place, I am very fond\r\nof the person you are going to marry; she is the most charming creature\r\nin France. Mind you treat her well, or you shall hear some news of me.\r\nBut you look as if you were good. I am told you are very remarkable. I\r\nhave heard all sorts of extraordinary things about you. _Voyons_, are\r\nthey true?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you can have heard,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you have your _l\xc3\xa9gende_. We have heard that you have had a career\r\nthe most checkered, the most _bizarre_. What is that about your having\r\nfounded a city some ten years ago in the great West, a city which\r\ncontains to-day half a million of inhabitants? Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it half a million,\r\nmessieurs? You are exclusive proprietor of this flourishing settlement,\r\nand are consequently fabulously rich, and you would be richer still if\r\nyou didn\xe2\x80\x99t grant lands and houses free of rent to all new-comers who\r\nwill pledge themselves never to smoke cigars. At this game, in three\r\nyears, we are told, you are going to be made president of America.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe duchess recited this amazing \xe2\x80\x9clegend\xe2\x80\x9d with a smooth self-possession\r\nwhich gave the speech to Newman\xe2\x80\x99s mind, the air of being a bit of\r\namusing dialogue in a play, delivered by a veteran comic actress.\r\nBefore she had ceased speaking he had burst into loud, irrepressible\r\nlaughter. \xe2\x80\x9cDear duchess, dear duchess,\xe2\x80\x9d the marquis began to murmur,\r\nsoothingly. Two or three persons came to the door of the room to see\r\nwho was laughing at the duchess. But the lady continued with the soft,\r\nserene assurance of a person who, as a duchess, was certain of being\r\nlistened to, and, as a garrulous woman, was independent of the pulse of\r\nher auditors. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I know you are very remarkable. You must be, to have\r\nendeared yourself to this good marquis and to his admirable world. They\r\nare very exacting. I myself am not very sure at this hour of really\r\npossessing it. Eh, Bellegarde? To please you, I see, one must be an\r\nAmerican millionaire. But your real triumph, my dear sir, is pleasing\r\nthe countess; she is as difficult as a princess in a fairy tale. Your\r\nsuccess is a miracle. What is your secret? I don\xe2\x80\x99t ask you to reveal it\r\nbefore all these gentlemen, but come and see me some day and give me a\r\nspecimen of your talents.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe secret is with Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must ask her\r\nfor it. It consists in her having a great deal of charity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery pretty!\xe2\x80\x9d said the duchess. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a very nice specimen, to begin\r\nwith. What, Bellegarde, are you already taking monsieur away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have a duty to perform, dear friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said the marquis, pointing to\r\nthe other groups.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, for you I know what that means. Well, I have seen monsieur; that\r\nis what I wanted. He can\xe2\x80\x99t persuade me that he isn\xe2\x80\x99t very clever.\r\nFarewell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs Newman passed on with his host, he asked who the duchess was. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\ngreatest lady in France,\xe2\x80\x9d said the marquis. M. de Bellegarde then\r\npresented his prospective brother-in-law to some twenty other persons\r\nof both sexes, selected apparently for their typically august\r\ncharacter. In some cases this character was written in good round hand\r\nupon the countenance of the wearer; in others Newman was thankful for\r\nsuch help as his companion\xe2\x80\x99s impressively brief intimation contributed\r\nto the discovery of it. There were large, majestic men, and small\r\ndemonstrative men; there were ugly ladies in yellow lace and quaint\r\njewels, and pretty ladies with white shoulders from which jewels and\r\neverything else were absent. Everyone gave Newman extreme attention,\r\neveryone smiled, everyone was charmed to make his acquaintance,\r\neveryone looked at him with that soft hardness of good society which\r\nputs out its hand but keeps its fingers closed over the coin. If the\r\nmarquis was going about as a bear-leader, if the fiction of Beauty and\r\nthe Beast was supposed to have found its companion-piece, the general\r\nimpression appeared to be that the bear was a very fair imitation of\r\nhumanity. Newman found his reception among the marquis\xe2\x80\x99s friends very\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cpleasant;\xe2\x80\x9d he could not have said more for it. It was pleasant to be\r\ntreated with so much explicit politeness; it was pleasant to hear\r\nneatly turned civilities, with a flavor of wit, uttered from beneath\r\ncarefully-shaped moustaches; it was pleasant to see clever\r\nFrenchwomen\xe2\x80\x94they all seemed clever\xe2\x80\x94turn their backs to their partners\r\nto get a good look at the strange American whom Claire de Cintr\xc3\xa9 was to\r\nmarry, and reward the object of the exhibition with a charming smile.\r\nAt last, as he turned away from a battery of smiles and other\r\namenities, Newman caught the eye of the marquis looking at him heavily;\r\nand thereupon, for a single instant, he checked himself. \xe2\x80\x9cAm I behaving\r\nlike a d\xe2\x80\x94d fool?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked himself. \xe2\x80\x9cAm I stepping about like a terrier\r\non his hind legs?\xe2\x80\x9d At this moment he perceived Mrs. Tristram at the\r\nother side of the room, and he waved his hand in farewell to M. de\r\nBellegarde and made his way toward her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I holding my head too high?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cDo I look as if I had the\r\nlower end of a pulley fastened to my chin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou look like all happy men, very ridiculous,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Tristram.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the usual thing, neither better nor worse. I have been watching\r\nyou for the last ten minutes, and I have been watching M. de\r\nBellegarde. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe more credit to him for putting it through,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I\r\nshall be generous. I shan\xe2\x80\x99t trouble him any more. But I am very happy.\r\nI can\xe2\x80\x99t stand still here. Please to take my arm and we will go for a\r\nwalk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe led Mrs. Tristram through all the rooms. There were a great many of\r\nthem, and, decorated for the occasion and filled with a stately crowd,\r\ntheir somewhat tarnished nobleness recovered its lustre. Mrs. Tristram,\r\nlooking about her, dropped a series of softly-incisive comments upon\r\nher fellow-guests. But Newman made vague answers; he hardly heard her,\r\nhis thoughts were elsewhere. They were lost in a cheerful sense of\r\nsuccess, of attainment and victory. His momentary care as to whether he\r\nlooked like a fool passed away, leaving him simply with a rich\r\ncontentment. He had got what he wanted. The savor of success had always\r\nbeen highly agreeable to him, and it had been his fortune to know it\r\noften. But it had never before been so sweet, been associated with so\r\nmuch that was brilliant and suggestive and entertaining. The lights,\r\nthe flowers, the music, the crowd, the splendid women, the jewels, the\r\nstrangeness even of the universal murmur of a clever foreign tongue\r\nwere all a vivid symbol and assurance of his having grasped his purpose\r\nand forced along his groove. If Newman\xe2\x80\x99s smile was larger than usual,\r\nit was not tickled vanity that pulled the strings; he had no wish to be\r\nshown with the finger or to achieve a personal success. If he could\r\nhave looked down at the scene, invisible, from a hole in the roof, he\r\nwould have enjoyed it quite as much. It would have spoken to him about\r\nhis own prosperity and deepened that easy feeling about life to which,\r\nsooner or later, he made all experience contribute. Just now the cup\r\nseemed full.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a very pretty party,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Tristram, after they had walked\r\na while. \xe2\x80\x9cI have seen nothing objectionable except my husband leaning\r\nagainst the wall and talking to an individual whom I suppose he takes\r\nfor a duke, but whom I more than suspect to be the functionary who\r\nattends to the lamps. Do you think you could separate them? Knock over\r\na lamp!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI doubt whether Newman, who saw no harm in Tristram\xe2\x80\x99s conversing with\r\nan ingenious mechanic, would have complied with this request; but at\r\nthis moment Valentin de Bellegarde drew near. Newman, some weeks\r\npreviously, had presented Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s youngest brother to Mrs.\r\nTristram, for whose merits Valentin professed a discriminating relish\r\nand to whom he had paid several visits.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you ever read Keats\xe2\x80\x99s Belle Dame sans Merci?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs. Tristram.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou remind me of the hero of the ballad:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x98Oh, what can ail thee, knight-at-arms,\r\n     Alone and palely loitering?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I am alone, it is because I have been deprived of your society,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Valentin. \xe2\x80\x9cBesides it is good manners for no man except Newman to\r\nlook happy. This is all to his address. It is not for you and me to go\r\nbefore the curtain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou promised me last spring,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman to Mrs. Tristram, \xe2\x80\x9cthat six\r\nmonths from that time I should get into a monstrous rage. It seems to\r\nme the time\xe2\x80\x99s up, and yet the nearest I can come to doing anything\r\nrough now is to offer you a _caf\xc3\xa9 glac\xc3\xa9_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told you we should do things grandly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Valentin. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nallude to the _caf\xc3\xa9s glac\xc3\xa9s_. But everyone is here, and my sister told\r\nme just now that Urbain had been adorable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a good fellow, he\xe2\x80\x99s a good fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cI love him as a\r\nbrother. That reminds me that I ought to go and say something polite to\r\nyour mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet it be something very polite indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Valentin. \xe2\x80\x9cIt may be the\r\nlast time you will feel so much like it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman walked away, almost disposed to clasp old Madame de Bellegarde\r\nround the waist. He passed through several rooms and at last found the\r\nold marquise in the first saloon, seated on a sofa, with her young\r\nkinsman, Lord Deepmere, beside her. The young man looked somewhat\r\nbored; his hands were thrust into his pockets and his eyes were fixed\r\nupon the toes of his shoes, his feet being thrust out in front of him.\r\nMadame de Bellegarde appeared to have been talking to him with some\r\nintensity and to be waiting for an answer to what she had said, or for\r\nsome sign of the effect of her words. Her hands were folded in her lap,\r\nand she was looking at his lordship\xe2\x80\x99s simple physiognomy with an air of\r\npolitely suppressed irritation.\r\n\r\nLord Deepmere looked up as Newman approached, met his eyes, and changed\r\ncolor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid I disturb an interesting interview,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\nMadame de Bellegarde rose, and her companion rising at the same time,\r\nshe put her hand into his arm. She answered nothing for an instant, and\r\nthen, as he remained silent, she said with a smile, \xe2\x80\x9cIt would be polite\r\nfor Lord Deepmere to say it was very interesting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99m not polite!\xe2\x80\x9d cried his lordship. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it _was_ interesting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadame de Bellegarde was giving you some good advice, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nNewman; \xe2\x80\x9ctoning you down a little?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was giving him some excellent advice,\xe2\x80\x9d said the marquise, fixing her\r\nfresh, cold eyes upon our hero. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s for him to take it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake it, sir\xe2\x80\x94take it,\xe2\x80\x9d Newman exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cAny advice the marquise\r\ngives you to-night must be good. For to-night, marquise, you must speak\r\nfrom a cheerful, comfortable spirit, and that makes good advice. You\r\nsee everything going on so brightly and successfully round you. Your\r\nparty is magnificent; it was a very happy thought. It is much better\r\nthan that thing of mine would have been.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you are pleased I am satisfied,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de Bellegarde. \xe2\x80\x9cMy\r\ndesire was to please you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you want to please me a little more?\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cJust drop our\r\nlordly friend; I am sure he wants to be off and shake his heels a\r\nlittle. Then take my arm and walk through the rooms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy desire was to please you,\xe2\x80\x9d the old lady repeated. And she liberated\r\nLord Deepmere, Newman rather wondering at her docility. \xe2\x80\x9cIf this young\r\nman is wise,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, \xe2\x80\x9che will go and find my daughter and ask her\r\nto dance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been endorsing your advice,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, bending over her and\r\nlaughing, \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose I must swallow that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLord Deepmere wiped his forehead and departed, and Madame de Bellegarde\r\ntook Newman\xe2\x80\x99s arm. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, it\xe2\x80\x99s a very pleasant, sociable entertainment,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nthe latter declared, as they proceeded on their circuit. \xe2\x80\x9cEveryone\r\nseems to know everyone and to be glad to see everyone. The marquis has\r\nmade me acquainted with ever so many people, and I feel quite like one\r\nof the family. It\xe2\x80\x99s an occasion,\xe2\x80\x9d Newman continued, wanting to say\r\nsomething thoroughly kind and comfortable, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I shall always\r\nremember, and remember very pleasantly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think it is an occasion that we shall none of us forget,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nmarquise, with her pure, neat enunciation.\r\n\r\nPeople made way for her as she passed, others turned round and looked\r\nat her, and she received a great many greetings and pressings of the\r\nhand, all of which she accepted with the most delicate dignity. But\r\nthough she smiled upon everyone, she said nothing until she reached the\r\nlast of the rooms, where she found her elder son. Then, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is\r\nenough, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d she declared with measured softness to Newman, and turned\r\nto the marquis. He put out both his hands and took both hers, drawing\r\nher to a seat with an air of the tenderest veneration. It was a most\r\nharmonious family group, and Newman discreetly retired. He moved\r\nthrough the rooms for some time longer, circulating freely, overtopping\r\nmost people by his great height, renewing acquaintance with some of the\r\ngroups to which Urbain de Bellegarde had presented him, and expending\r\ngenerally the surplus of his equanimity. He continued to find it all\r\nextremely agreeable; but the most agreeable things have an end, and the\r\nrevelry on this occasion began to deepen to a close. The music was\r\nsounding its ultimate strains and people were looking for the marquise,\r\nto make their farewells. There seemed to be some difficulty in finding\r\nher, and Newman heard a report that she had left the ball, feeling\r\nfaint. \xe2\x80\x9cShe has succumbed to the emotions of the evening,\xe2\x80\x9d he heard a\r\nlady say. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor, dear marquise; I can imagine all that they may have\r\nbeen for her!\xe2\x80\x9d But he learned immediately afterwards that she had\r\nrecovered herself and was seated in an armchair near the doorway,\r\nreceiving parting compliments from great ladies who insisted upon her\r\nnot rising. He himself set out in quest of Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9. He had\r\nseen her move past him many times in the rapid circles of a waltz, but\r\nin accordance with her explicit instructions he had exchanged no words\r\nwith her since the beginning of the evening. The whole house having\r\nbeen thrown open, the apartments of the _rez-de-chauss\xc3\xa9e_ were also\r\naccessible, though a smaller number of persons had gathered there.\r\nNewman wandered through them, observing a few scattered couples to whom\r\nthis comparative seclusion appeared grateful and reached a small\r\nconservatory which opened into the garden. The end of the conservatory\r\nwas formed by a clear sheet of glass, unmasked by plants, and admitting\r\nthe winter starlight so directly that a person standing there would\r\nseem to have passed into the open air. Two persons stood there now, a\r\nlady and a gentleman; the lady Newman, from within the room and\r\nalthough she had turned her back to it, immediately recognized as\r\nMadame de Cintr\xc3\xa9. He hesitated as to whether he would advance, but as\r\nhe did so she looked round, feeling apparently that he was there. She\r\nrested her eyes on him a moment and then turned again to her companion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is almost a pity not to tell Mr. Newman,\xe2\x80\x9d she said softly, but in a\r\ntone that Newman could hear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell him if you like!\xe2\x80\x9d the gentleman answered, in the voice of Lord\r\nDeepmere.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, tell me by all means!\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman advancing.\r\n\r\nLord Deepmere, he observed, was very red in the face, and he had\r\ntwisted his gloves into a tight cord as if he had been squeezing them\r\ndry. These, presumably, were tokens of violent emotion, and it seemed\r\nto Newman that the traces of corresponding agitation were visible in\r\nMadame de Cintr\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s face. The two had been talking with much vivacity.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I should tell you is only to my lord\xe2\x80\x99s credit,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de\r\nCintr\xc3\xa9, smiling frankly enough.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like it any better for that!\xe2\x80\x9d said my lord, with his\r\nawkward laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome; what\xe2\x80\x99s the mystery?\xe2\x80\x9d Newman demanded. \xe2\x80\x9cClear it up. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like\r\nmysteries.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must have some things we don\xe2\x80\x99t like, and go without some we do,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the ruddy young nobleman, laughing still.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s to Lord Deepmere\xe2\x80\x99s credit, but it is not to everyone\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMadam de Cintr\xc3\xa9. \xe2\x80\x9cSo I shall say nothing about it. You may be sure,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe added; and she put out her hand to the Englishman, who took it half\r\nshyly, half impetuously. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd now go and dance!\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, I feel awfully like dancing!\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall go and get\r\ntipsy.\xe2\x80\x9d And he walked away with a gloomy guffaw.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat has happened between you?\xe2\x80\x9d Newman asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you\xe2\x80\x94now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9. \xe2\x80\x9cNothing that need make\r\nyou unhappy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas the little Englishman been trying to make love to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe hesitated, and then she uttered a grave \xe2\x80\x9cNo! he\xe2\x80\x99s a very honest\r\nlittle fellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you are agitated. Something is the matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing, I repeat, that need make you unhappy. My agitation is over.\r\nSome day I will tell you what it was; not now. I can\xe2\x80\x99t now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I confess,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Newman, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to hear anything\r\nunpleasant. I am satisfied with everything\xe2\x80\x94most of all with you. I have\r\nseen all the ladies and talked with a great many of them; but I am\r\nsatisfied with you.\xe2\x80\x9d Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 covered him for a moment with her\r\nlarge, soft glance, and then turned her eyes away into the starry\r\nnight. So they stood silent a moment, side by side. \xe2\x80\x9cSay you are\r\nsatisfied with me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\nHe had to wait a moment for the answer; but it came at last, low yet\r\ndistinct: \xe2\x80\x9cI am very happy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was presently followed by a few words from another source, which\r\nmade them both turn round. \xe2\x80\x9cI am sadly afraid Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 will\r\ntake a chill. I have ventured to bring a shawl.\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Bread stood there\r\nsoftly solicitous, holding a white drapery in her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9, \xe2\x80\x9cthe sight of those cold stars\r\ngives one a sense of frost. I won\xe2\x80\x99t take your shawl, but we will go\r\nback into the house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe passed back and Newman followed her, Mrs. Bread standing\r\nrespectfully aside to make way for them. Newman paused an instant\r\nbefore the old woman, and she glanced up at him with a silent greeting.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou must come and live with us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then, sir, if you will,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have not seen the\r\nlast of me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n\r\nNewman was fond of music and went often to the opera. A couple of\r\nevenings after Madame de Bellegarde\xe2\x80\x99s ball he sat listening to \xe2\x80\x9cDon\r\nGiovanni,\xe2\x80\x9d having in honor of this work, which he had never yet seen\r\nrepresented, come to occupy his orchestra-chair before the rising of\r\nthe curtain. Frequently he took a large box and invited a party of his\r\ncompatriots; this was a mode of recreation to which he was much\r\naddicted. He liked making up parties of his friends and conducting them\r\nto the theatre, and taking them to drive on high drags or to dine at\r\nremote restaurants. He liked doing things which involved his paying for\r\npeople; the vulgar truth is that he enjoyed \xe2\x80\x9ctreating\xe2\x80\x9d them. This was\r\nnot because he was what is called purse-proud; handling money in public\r\nwas on the contrary positively disagreeable to him; he had a sort of\r\npersonal modesty about it, akin to what he would have felt about making\r\na toilet before spectators. But just as it was a gratification to him\r\nto be handsomely dressed, just so it was a private satisfaction to him\r\n(he enjoyed it very clandestinely) to have interposed, pecuniarily, in\r\na scheme of pleasure. To set a large group of people in motion and\r\ntransport them to a distance, to have special conveyances, to charter\r\nrailway-carriages and steamboats, harmonized with his relish for bold\r\nprocesses, and made hospitality seem more active and more to the\r\npurpose. A few evenings before the occasion of which I speak he had\r\ninvited several ladies and gentlemen to the opera to listen to Madame\r\nAlboni\xe2\x80\x94a party which included Miss Dora Finch. It befell, however, that\r\nMiss Dora Finch, sitting near Newman in the box, discoursed\r\nbrilliantly, not only during the entr\xe2\x80\x99actes, but during many of the\r\nfinest portions of the performance, so that Newman had really come away\r\nwith an irritated sense that Madame Alboni had a thin, shrill voice,\r\nand that her musical phrase was much garnished with a laugh of the\r\ngiggling order. After this he promised himself to go for a while to the\r\nopera alone.\r\n\r\nWhen the curtain had fallen upon the first act of \xe2\x80\x9cDon Giovanni\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nturned round in his place to observe the house. Presently, in one of\r\nthe boxes, he perceived Urbain de Bellegarde and his wife. The little\r\nmarquise was sweeping the house very busily with a glass, and Newman,\r\nsupposing that she saw him, determined to go and bid her good evening.\r\nM. de Bellegarde was leaning against a column, motionless, looking\r\nstraight in front of him, with one hand in the breast of his white\r\nwaistcoat and the other resting his hat on his thigh. Newman was about\r\nto leave his place when he noticed in that obscure region devoted to\r\nthe small boxes which in France are called, not inaptly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbathing-tubs,\xe2\x80\x9d a face which even the dim light and the distance could\r\nnot make wholly indistinct. It was the face of a young and pretty\r\nwoman, and it was surmounted with a _coiffure_ of pink roses and\r\ndiamonds. This person was looking round the house, and her fan was\r\nmoving to and fro with the most practiced grace; when she lowered it,\r\nNewman perceived a pair of plump white shoulders and the edge of a\r\nrose-colored dress. Beside her, very close to the shoulders and\r\ntalking, apparently with an earnestness which it pleased her scantily\r\nto heed, sat a young man with a red face and a very low shirt-collar. A\r\nmoment\xe2\x80\x99s gazing left Newman with no doubts; the pretty young woman was\r\nNo\xc3\xa9mie Nioche. He looked hard into the depths of the box, thinking her\r\nfather might perhaps be in attendance, but from what he could see the\r\nyoung man\xe2\x80\x99s eloquence had no other auditor. Newman at last made his way\r\nout, and in doing so he passed beneath the _baignoire_ of Mademoiselle\r\nNo\xc3\xa9mie. She saw him as he approached and gave him a nod and smile which\r\nseemed meant as an assurance that she was still a good-natured girl, in\r\nspite of her enviable rise in the world. Newman passed into the _foyer_\r\nand walked through it. Suddenly he paused in front of a gentleman\r\nseated on one of the divans. The gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s elbows were on his knees;\r\nhe was leaning forward and staring at the pavement, lost apparently in\r\nmeditations of a somewhat gloomy cast. But in spite of his bent head\r\nNewman recognized him, and in a moment sat down beside him. Then the\r\ngentleman looked up and displayed the expressive countenance of\r\nValentin de Bellegarde.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat in the world are you thinking of so hard?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA subject that requires hard thinking to do it justice,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nValentin. \xe2\x80\x9cMy immeasurable idiocy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe matter now is that I am a man again, and no more a fool than\r\nusual. But I came within an inch of taking that girl _au s\xc3\xa9rieux_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean the young lady below stairs, in a _baignoire_ in a pink\r\ndress?\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you notice what a brilliant kind of pink it was?\xe2\x80\x9d Valentin\r\ninquired, by way of answer. \xe2\x80\x9cIt makes her look as white as new milk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhite or black, as you please. But you have stopped going to see her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, bless you, no. Why should I stop? I have changed, but she hasn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Valentin. \xe2\x80\x9cI see she is a vulgar little wretch, after all. But she\r\nis as amusing as ever, and one _must_ be amused.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I am glad she strikes you so unpleasantly,\xe2\x80\x9d Newman rejoiced. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nsuppose you have swallowed all those fine words you used about her the\r\nother night. You compared her to a sapphire, or a topaz, or an\r\namethyst\xe2\x80\x94some precious stone; what was it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t remember,\xe2\x80\x9d said Valentin, \xe2\x80\x9cit may have been to a carbuncle!\r\nBut she won\xe2\x80\x99t make a fool of me now. She has no real charm. It\xe2\x80\x99s an\r\nawfully low thing to make a mistake about a person of that sort.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI congratulate you,\xe2\x80\x9d Newman declared, \xe2\x80\x9cupon the scales having fallen\r\nfrom your eyes. It\xe2\x80\x99s a great triumph; it ought to make you feel\r\nbetter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it makes me feel better!\xe2\x80\x9d said Valentin, gaily. Then, checking\r\nhimself, he looked askance at Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cI rather think you are laughing\r\nat me. If you were not one of the family I would take it up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, I\xe2\x80\x99m not laughing, any more than I am one of the family. You\r\nmake me feel badly. You are too clever a fellow, you are made of too\r\ngood stuff, to spend your time in ups and downs over that class of\r\ngoods. The idea of splitting hairs about Miss Nioche! It seems to me\r\nawfully foolish. You say you have given up taking her seriously; but\r\nyou take her seriously so long as you take her at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nValentin turned round in his place and looked a while at Newman,\r\nwrinkling his forehead and rubbing his knees. \xe2\x80\x9c_Vous parlez d\xe2\x80\x99or_. But\r\nshe has wonderfully pretty arms. Would you believe I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know it\r\ntill this evening?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut she is a vulgar little wretch, remember, all the same,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nNewman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; the other day she had the bad taste to begin to abuse her father,\r\nto his face, in my presence. I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have expected it of her; it\r\nwas a disappointment; heigho!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, she cares no more for her father than for her door-mat,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nNewman. \xe2\x80\x9cI discovered that the first time I saw her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that\xe2\x80\x99s another affair; she may think of the poor old beggar what\r\nshe pleases. But it was low in her to call him bad names; it quite\r\nthrew me off. It was about a frilled petticoat that he was to have\r\nfetched from the washer-woman\xe2\x80\x99s; he appeared to have neglected this\r\ngraceful duty. She almost boxed his ears. He stood there staring at her\r\nwith his little blank eyes and smoothing his old hat with his\r\ncoat-tail. At last he turned round and went out without a word. Then I\r\ntold her it was in very bad taste to speak so to one\xe2\x80\x99s papa. She said\r\nshe should be so thankful to me if I would mention it to her whenever\r\nher taste was at fault; she had immense confidence in mine. I told her\r\nI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have the bother of forming her manners; I had had an idea\r\nthey were already formed, after the best models. She had disappointed\r\nme. But I shall get over it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Valentin, gaily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, time\xe2\x80\x99s a great consoler!\xe2\x80\x9d Newman answered with humorous sobriety.\r\nHe was silent a moment, and then he added, in another tone, \xe2\x80\x9cI wish you\r\nwould think of what I said to you the other day. Come over to America\r\nwith us, and I will put you in the way of doing some business. You have\r\na very good head, if you will only use it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nValentin made a genial grimace. \xe2\x80\x9cMy head is much obliged to you. Do you\r\nmean the place in a bank?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are several places, but I suppose you would consider the bank\r\nthe most aristocratic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nValentin burst into a laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear fellow, at night all cats are\r\ngray! When one derogates there are no degrees.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman answered nothing for a minute. Then, \xe2\x80\x9cI think you will find\r\nthere are degrees in success,\xe2\x80\x9d he said with a certain dryness.\r\n\r\nValentin had leaned forward again, with his elbows on his knees, and he\r\nwas scratching the pavement with his stick. At last he said, looking\r\nup, \xe2\x80\x9cDo you really think I ought to do something?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman laid his hand on his companion\xe2\x80\x99s arm and looked at him a moment\r\nthrough sagaciously-narrowed eyelids. \xe2\x80\x9cTry it and see. You are not good\r\nenough for it, but we will stretch a point.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you really think I can make some money? I should like to see how it\r\nfeels to have a little.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo what I tell you, and you shall be rich,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cThink of\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d And he looked at his watch and prepared to resume his way to\r\nMadame de Bellegarde\xe2\x80\x99s box.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my word I will think of it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Valentin. \xe2\x80\x9cI will go and listen\r\nto Mozart another half hour\xe2\x80\x94I can always think better to music\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nprofoundly meditate upon it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe marquis was with his wife when Newman entered their box; he was\r\nbland, remote, and correct as usual; or, as it seemed to Newman, even\r\nmore than usual.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think of the opera?\xe2\x80\x9d asked our hero. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think of\r\nthe Don?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe all know what Mozart is,\xe2\x80\x9d said the marquis; \xe2\x80\x9cour impressions don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndate from this evening. Mozart is youth, freshness, brilliancy,\r\nfacility\xe2\x80\x94a little too great facility, perhaps. But the execution is\r\nhere and there deplorably rough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very curious to see how it ends,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou speak as if it were a _feuilleton_ in the _Figaro_,\xe2\x80\x9d observed the\r\nmarquis. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have surely seen the opera before?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cI am sure I should have remembered it. Donna\r\nElvira reminds me of Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9; I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean in her\r\ncircumstances, but in the music she sings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a very nice distinction,\xe2\x80\x9d laughed the marquis lightly. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is\r\nno great possibility, I imagine, of Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 being forsaken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot much!\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what becomes of the Don?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil comes down\xe2\x80\x94or comes up,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de Bellegarde, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\ncarries him off. I suppose Zerlina reminds you of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will go to the _foyer_ for a few moments,\xe2\x80\x9d said the marquis, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\ngive you a chance to say that the commander\xe2\x80\x94the man of stone\xe2\x80\x94resembles\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d And he passed out of the box.\r\n\r\nThe little marquise stared an instant at the velvet ledge of the\r\nbalcony, and then murmured, \xe2\x80\x9cNot a man of stone, a man of wood.\xe2\x80\x9d Newman\r\nhad taken her husband\xe2\x80\x99s empty chair. She made no protest, and then she\r\nturned suddenly and laid her closed fan upon his arm. \xe2\x80\x9cI am very glad\r\nyou came in,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to ask you a favor. I wanted to do so\r\non Thursday, at my mother-in-law\xe2\x80\x99s ball, but you would give me no\r\nchance. You were in such very good spirits that I thought you might\r\ngrant my little favor then; not that you look particularly doleful now.\r\nIt is something you must promise me; now is the time to take you; after\r\nyou are married you will be good for nothing. Come, promise!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never sign a paper without reading it first,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cShow me\r\nyour document.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, you must sign with your eyes shut; I will hold your hand. Come,\r\nbefore you put your head into the noose. You ought to be thankful to me\r\nfor giving you a chance to do something amusing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it is so amusing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, \xe2\x80\x9cit will be in even better season\r\nafter I am married.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn other words,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Madame de Bellegarde, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will not do it at\r\nall. You will be afraid of your wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, if the thing is intrinsically improper,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t go\r\ninto it. If it is not, I will do it after my marriage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou talk like a treatise on logic, and English logic into the\r\nbargain!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Madame de Bellegarde. \xe2\x80\x9cPromise, then, after you are\r\nmarried. After all, I shall enjoy keeping you to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, after I am married,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman serenely.\r\n\r\nThe little marquise hesitated a moment, looking at him, and he wondered\r\nwhat was coming. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you know what my life is,\xe2\x80\x9d she presently\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cI have no pleasure, I see nothing, I do nothing. I live in Paris\r\nas I might live at Poitiers. My mother-in-law calls me\xe2\x80\x94what is the\r\npretty word?\xe2\x80\x94a gad-about? accuses me of going to unheard-of places, and\r\nthinks it ought to be joy enough for me to sit at home and count over\r\nmy ancestors on my fingers. But why should I bother about my ancestors?\r\nI am sure they never bothered about me. I don\xe2\x80\x99t propose to live with a\r\ngreen shade on my eyes; I hold that things were made to look at. My\r\nhusband, you know, has principles, and the first on the list is that\r\nthe Tuileries are dreadfully vulgar. If the Tuileries are vulgar, his\r\nprinciples are tiresome. If I chose I might have principles quite as\r\nwell as he. If they grew on one\xe2\x80\x99s family tree I should only have to\r\ngive mine a shake to bring down a shower of the finest. At any rate, I\r\nprefer clever Bonapartes to stupid Bourbons.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I see; you want to go to court,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, vaguely conjecturing\r\nthat she might wish him to appeal to the United States legation to\r\nsmooth her way to the imperial halls.\r\n\r\nThe marquise gave a little sharp laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are a thousand miles away.\r\nI will take care of the Tuileries myself; the day I decide to go they\r\nwill be very glad to have me. Sooner or later I shall dance in an\r\nimperial quadrille. I know what you are going to say: \xe2\x80\x98How will you\r\ndare?\xe2\x80\x99 But I _shall_ dare. I am afraid of my husband; he is soft,\r\nsmooth, irreproachable; everything that you know; but I am afraid of\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x94horribly afraid of him. And yet I shall arrive at the Tuileries.\r\nBut that will not be this winter, nor perhaps next, and meantime I must\r\nlive. For the moment, I want to go somewhere else; it\xe2\x80\x99s my dream. I\r\nwant to go to the Bal Bullier.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the Bal Bullier?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Newman, for whom the words at first\r\nmeant nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe ball in the Latin Quarter, where the students dance with their\r\nmistresses. Don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me you have not heard of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman; \xe2\x80\x9cI have heard of it; I remember now. I have even\r\nbeen there. And you want to go there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is silly, it is low, it is anything you please. But I want to go.\r\nSome of my friends have been, and they say it is awfully _dr\xc3\xb4le_. My\r\nfriends go everywhere; it is only I who sit moping at home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to me you are not at home now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, \xe2\x80\x9cand I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nexactly say you were moping.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am bored to death. I have been to the opera twice a week for the\r\nlast eight years. Whenever I ask for anything my mouth is stopped with\r\nthat: Pray, madam, haven\xe2\x80\x99t you an opera box? Could a woman of taste\r\nwant more? In the first place, my opera box was down in my _contrat_;\r\nthey have to give it to me. To-night, for instance, I should have\r\npreferred a thousand times to go to the Palais Royal. But my husband\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t go to the Palais Royal because the ladies of the court go there\r\nso much. You may imagine, then, whether he would take me to Bullier\xe2\x80\x99s;\r\nhe says it is a mere imitation\xe2\x80\x94and a bad one\xe2\x80\x94of what they do at the\r\nPrincess Kleinfuss\xe2\x80\x99s. But as I don\xe2\x80\x99t go to the Princess Kleinfuss\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nthe next best thing is to go to Bullier\xe2\x80\x99s. It is my dream, at any rate,\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s a fixed idea. All I ask of you is to give me your arm; you are\r\nless compromising than anyone else. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why, but you are. I\r\ncan arrange it. I shall risk something, but that is my own affair.\r\nBesides, fortune favors the bold. Don\xe2\x80\x99t refuse me; it is my dream!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman gave a loud laugh. It seemed to him hardly worth while to be the\r\nwife of the Marquis de Bellegarde, a daughter of the crusaders, heiress\r\nof six centuries of glories and traditions, to have centred one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\naspirations upon the sight of a couple of hundred young ladies kicking\r\noff young men\xe2\x80\x99s hats. It struck him as a theme for the moralist; but he\r\nhad no time to moralize upon it. The curtain rose again; M. de\r\nBellegarde returned, and Newman went back to his seat.\r\n\r\nHe observed that Valentin de Bellegarde had taken his place in the\r\n_baignoire_ of Mademoiselle Nioche, behind this young lady and her\r\ncompanion, where he was visible only if one carefully looked for him.\r\nIn the next act Newman met him in the lobby and asked him if he had\r\nreflected upon possible emigration. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you really meant to meditate,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou might have chosen a better place for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, the place was not bad,\xe2\x80\x9d said Valentin. \xe2\x80\x9cI was not thinking of that\r\ngirl. I listened to the music, and, without thinking of the play or\r\nlooking at the stage, I turned over your proposal. At first it seemed\r\nquite fantastic. And then a certain fiddle in the orchestra\xe2\x80\x94I could\r\ndistinguish it\xe2\x80\x94began to say as it scraped away, \xe2\x80\x98Why not, why not?\xe2\x80\x99 And\r\nthen, in that rapid movement, all the fiddles took it up and the\r\nconductor\xe2\x80\x99s stick seemed to beat it in the air: \xe2\x80\x98Why not, why not?\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nsure I can\xe2\x80\x99t say! I don\xe2\x80\x99t see why not. I don\xe2\x80\x99t see why I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do\r\nsomething. It appears to me really a very bright idea. This sort of\r\nthing is certainly very stale. And then I could come back with a trunk\r\nfull of dollars. Besides, I might possibly find it amusing. They call\r\nme a _raffin\xc3\xa9_; who knows but that I might discover an unsuspected\r\ncharm in shop-keeping? It would really have a certain romantic,\r\npicturesque side; it would look well in my biography. It would look as\r\nif I were a strong man, a first-rate man, a man who dominated\r\ncircumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind how it would look,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cIt always looks well to\r\nhave half a million of dollars. There is no reason why you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhave them if you will mind what I tell you\xe2\x80\x94I alone\xe2\x80\x94and not talk to\r\nother parties.\xe2\x80\x9d He passed his arm into that of his companion, and the\r\ntwo walked for some time up and down one of the less frequented\r\ncorridors. Newman\xe2\x80\x99s imagination began to glow with the idea of\r\nconverting his bright, impracticable friend into a first-class man of\r\nbusiness. He felt for the moment a sort of spiritual zeal, the zeal of\r\nthe propagandist. Its ardor was in part the result of that general\r\ndiscomfort which the sight of all uninvested capital produced in him;\r\nso fine an intelligence as Bellegarde\xe2\x80\x99s ought to be dedicated to high\r\nuses. The highest uses known to Newman\xe2\x80\x99s experience were certain\r\ntranscendent sagacities in the handling of railway stock. And then his\r\nzeal was quickened by his personal kindness for Valentin; he had a sort\r\nof pity for him which he was well aware he never could have made the\r\nComte de Bellegarde understand. He never lost a sense of its being\r\npitiable that Valentin should think it a large life to revolve in\r\nvarnished boots between the Rue d\xe2\x80\x99Anjou and the Rue de l\xe2\x80\x99Universit\xc3\xa9,\r\ntaking the Boulevard des Italiens on the way, when over there in\r\nAmerica one\xe2\x80\x99s promenade was a continent, and one\xe2\x80\x99s Boulevard stretched\r\nfrom New York to San Francisco. It mortified him, moreover, to think\r\nthat Valentin lacked money; there was a painful grotesqueness in it. It\r\naffected him as the ignorance of a companion, otherwise without\r\nreproach, touching some rudimentary branch of learning would have done.\r\nThere were things that one knew about as a matter of course, he would\r\nhave said in such a case. Just so, if one pretended to be easy in the\r\nworld, one had money as a matter of course, one had made it! There was\r\nsomething almost ridiculously anomalous to Newman in the sight of\r\nlively pretensions unaccompanied by large investments in railroads;\r\nthough I may add that he would not have maintained that such\r\ninvestments were in themselves a proper ground for pretensions. \xe2\x80\x9cI will\r\nmake you do something,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Valentin; \xe2\x80\x9cI will put you through. I\r\nknow half a dozen things in which we can make a place for you. You will\r\nsee some lively work. It will take you a little while to get used to\r\nthe life, but you will work in before long, and at the end of six\r\nmonths\xe2\x80\x94after you have done a thing or two on your own account\xe2\x80\x94you will\r\nlike it. And then it will be very pleasant for you, having your sister\r\nover there. It will be pleasant for her to have you, too. Yes,\r\nValentin,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Newman, pressing his friend\xe2\x80\x99s arm genially, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nthink I see just the opening for you. Keep quiet and I\xe2\x80\x99ll push you\r\nright in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman pursued this favoring strain for some time longer. The two men\r\nstrolled about for a quarter of an hour. Valentin listened and\r\nquestioned, many of his questions making Newman laugh loud at the\r\n_na\xc3\xafvet\xc3\xa9_ of his ignorance of the vulgar processes of money-getting;\r\nsmiling himself, too, half ironical and half curious. And yet he was\r\nserious; he was fascinated by Newman\xe2\x80\x99s plain prose version of the\r\nlegend of El Dorado. It is true, however, that though to accept an\r\n\xe2\x80\x9copening\xe2\x80\x9d in an American mercantile house might be a bold, original,\r\nand in its consequences extremely agreeable thing to do, he did not\r\nquite see himself objectively doing it. So that when the bell rang to\r\nindicate the close of the entr\xe2\x80\x99acte, there was a certain mock-heroism\r\nin his saying, with his brilliant smile, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, put me through;\r\npush me in! I make myself over to you. Dip me into the pot and turn me\r\ninto gold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey had passed into the corridor which encircled the row of\r\n_baignoires_, and Valentin stopped in front of the dusky little box in\r\nwhich Mademoiselle Nioche had bestowed herself, laying his hand on the\r\ndoorknob. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, come, are you going back there?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Mon Dieu, oui_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Valentin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t you another place?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I have my usual place, in the stalls.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had better go and occupy it, then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see her very well from there, too,\xe2\x80\x9d added Valentin, serenely, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nto-night she is worth seeing. But,\xe2\x80\x9d he added in a moment, \xe2\x80\x9cI have a\r\nparticular reason for going back just now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I give you up,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are infatuated!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it is only this. There is a young man in the box whom I shall\r\nannoy by going in, and I want to annoy him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry to hear it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t you leave the poor fellow\r\nalone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, he has given me cause. The box is not his. No\xc3\xa9mie came in alone\r\nand installed herself. I went and spoke to her, and in a few moments\r\nshe asked me to go and get her fan from the pocket of her cloak, which\r\nthe _ouvreuse_ had carried off. In my absence this gentleman came in\r\nand took the chair beside No\xc3\xa9mie in which I had been sitting. My\r\nreappearance disgusted him, and he had the grossness to show it. He\r\ncame within an ace of being impertinent. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know who he is; he is\r\nsome vulgar wretch. I can\xe2\x80\x99t think where she picks up such\r\nacquaintances. He has been drinking, too, but he knows what he is\r\nabout. Just now, in the second act, he was unmannerly again. I shall\r\nput in another appearance for ten minutes\xe2\x80\x94time enough to give him an\r\nopportunity to commit himself, if he feels inclined. I really can\xe2\x80\x99t let\r\nthe brute suppose that he is keeping me out of the box.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, remonstrantly, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat child\xe2\x80\x99s play! You\r\nare not going to pick a quarrel about that girl, I hope.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat girl has nothing to do with it, and I have no intention of\r\npicking a quarrel. I am not a bully nor a fire-eater. I simply wish to\r\nmake a point that a gentleman must.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, damn your point!\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is the trouble with you\r\nFrenchmen; you must be always making points. Well,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9cbe\r\nshort. But if you are going in for this kind of thing, we must ship you\r\noff to America in advance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good,\xe2\x80\x9d Valentin answered, \xe2\x80\x9cwhenever you please. But if I go to\r\nAmerica, I must not let this gentleman suppose that it is to run away\r\nfrom him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd they separated. At the end of the act Newman observed that Valentin\r\nwas still in the _baignoire_. He strolled into the corridor again,\r\nexpecting to meet him, and when he was within a few yards of\r\nMademoiselle Nioche\xe2\x80\x99s box saw his friend pass out, accompanied by the\r\nyoung man who had been seated beside its fair occupant. The two\r\ngentlemen walked with some quickness of step to a distant part of the\r\nlobby, where Newman perceived them stop and stand talking. The manner\r\nof each was perfectly quiet, but the stranger, who looked flushed, had\r\nbegun to wipe his face very emphatically with his pocket-handkerchief.\r\nBy this time Newman was abreast of the _baignoire_; the door had been\r\nleft ajar, and he could see a pink dress inside. He immediately went\r\nin. Mademoiselle Nioche turned and greeted him with a brilliant smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you have at last decided to come and see me?\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\njust save your politeness. You find me in a fine moment. Sit down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThere was a very becoming little flush in her cheek, and her eye had a\r\nnoticeable spark. You would have said that she had received some very\r\ngood news.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething has happened here!\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, without sitting down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou find me in a very fine moment,\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cTwo gentlemen\xe2\x80\x94one\r\nof them is M. de Bellegarde, the pleasure of whose acquaintance I owe\r\nto you\xe2\x80\x94have just had words about your humble servant. Very big words\r\ntoo. They can\xe2\x80\x99t come off without crossing swords. A duel\xe2\x80\x94that will give\r\nme a push!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mademoiselle No\xc3\xa9mie clapping her little hands.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_C\xe2\x80\x99est \xc3\xa7a qui pose une femme!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to say that Bellegarde is going to fight about _you!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nexclaimed Newman disgustedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing else!\xe2\x80\x9d and she looked at him with a hard little smile. \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\r\nno, you are not _galant!_ And if you prevent this affair I shall owe\r\nyou a grudge\xe2\x80\x94and pay my debt!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman uttered an imprecation which, though brief\xe2\x80\x94it consisted simply\r\nof the interjection \xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d followed by a geographical, or more\r\ncorrectly, perhaps a theological noun in four letters\xe2\x80\x94had better not be\r\ntransferred to these pages. He turned his back without more ceremony\r\nupon the pink dress and went out of the box. In the corridor he found\r\nValentin and his companion walking towards him. The latter was\r\nthrusting a card into his waistcoat pocket. Mademoiselle No\xc3\xa9mie\xe2\x80\x99s\r\njealous votary was a tall, robust young man with a thick nose, a\r\nprominent blue eye, a Germanic physiognomy, and a massive watch-chain.\r\nWhen they reached the box, Valentin with an emphasized bow made way for\r\nhim to pass in first. Newman touched Valentin\xe2\x80\x99s arm as a sign that he\r\nwished to speak with him, and Bellegarde answered that he would be with\r\nhim in an instant. Valentin entered the box after the robust young man,\r\nbut a couple of minutes afterwards he reappeared, largely smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is immensely tickled,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cShe says we will make her\r\nfortune. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be fatuous, but I think it is very possible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you are going to fight?\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear fellow, don\xe2\x80\x99t look so mortally disgusted. It was not my\r\nchoice. The thing is all arranged.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told you so!\xe2\x80\x9d groaned Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told _him_ so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Valentin, smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did he do to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy good friend, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter what. He used an expression\xe2\x80\x94I took\r\nit up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I insist upon knowing; I can\xe2\x80\x99t, as your elder brother, have you\r\nrushing into this sort of nonsense.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very much obliged to you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Valentin. \xe2\x80\x9cI have nothing to\r\nconceal, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t go into particulars now and here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will leave this place, then. You can tell me outside.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, I can\xe2\x80\x99t leave this place, why should I hurry away? I will go to\r\nmy orchestra-stall and sit out the opera.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will not enjoy it; you will be preoccupied.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nValentin looked at him a moment, colored a little, smiled, and patted\r\nhim on the arm. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are delightfully simple! Before an affair a man is\r\nquiet. The quietest thing I can do is to go straight to my place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, \xe2\x80\x9cyou want her to see you there\xe2\x80\x94you and your\r\nquietness. I am not so simple! It is a poor business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nValentin remained, and the two men, in their respective places, sat out\r\nthe rest of the performance, which was also enjoyed by Mademoiselle\r\nNioche and her truculent admirer. At the end Newman joined Valentin\r\nagain, and they went into the street together. Valentin shook his head\r\nat his friend\xe2\x80\x99s proposal that he should get into Newman\xe2\x80\x99s own vehicle,\r\nand stopped on the edge of the pavement. \xe2\x80\x9cI must go off alone,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid; \xe2\x80\x9cI must look up a couple of friends who will take charge of this\r\nmatter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will take charge of it,\xe2\x80\x9d Newman declared. \xe2\x80\x9cPut it into my hands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are very kind, but that is hardly possible. In the first place,\r\nyou are, as you said just now, almost my brother; you are about to\r\nmarry my sister. That alone disqualifies you; it casts doubts on your\r\nimpartiality. And if it didn\xe2\x80\x99t, it would be enough for me that I\r\nstrongly suspect you of disapproving of the affair. You would try to\r\nprevent a meeting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I should,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cWhoever your friends are, I hope\r\nthey will do that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnquestionably they will. They will urge that excuses be made, proper\r\nexcuses. But you would be too good-natured. You won\xe2\x80\x99t do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman was silent a moment. He was keenly annoyed, but he saw it was\r\nuseless to attempt interference. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen is this precious performance to\r\ncome off?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe sooner the better,\xe2\x80\x9d said Valentin. \xe2\x80\x9cThe day after to-morrow, I\r\nhope.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, \xe2\x80\x9cI have certainly a claim to know the facts. I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t consent to shut my eyes to the matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall be most happy to tell you the facts,\xe2\x80\x9d said Valentin. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are\r\nvery simple, and it will be quickly done. But now everything depends on\r\nmy putting my hands on my friends without delay. I will jump into a\r\ncab; you had better drive to my room and wait for me there. I will turn\r\nup at the end of an hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman assented protestingly, let his friend go, and then betook\r\nhimself to the picturesque little apartment in the Rue d\xe2\x80\x99Anjou. It was\r\nmore than an hour before Valentin returned, but when he did so he was\r\nable to announce that he had found one of his desired friends, and that\r\nthis gentleman had taken upon himself the care of securing an\r\nassociate. Newman had been sitting without lights by Valentin\xe2\x80\x99s faded\r\nfire, upon which he had thrown a log; the blaze played over the\r\nrichly-encumbered little sitting-room and produced fantastic gleams and\r\nshadows. He listened in silence to Valentin\xe2\x80\x99s account of what had\r\npassed between him and the gentleman whose card he had in his pocket\xe2\x80\x94M.\r\nStanislas Kapp, of Strasbourg\xe2\x80\x94after his return to Mademoiselle Nioche\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbox. This hospitable young lady had espied an acquaintance on the other\r\nside of the house, and had expressed her displeasure at his not having\r\nthe civility to come and pay her a visit. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, let him alone!\xe2\x80\x9d M.\r\nStanislas Kapp had hereupon exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are too many people in\r\nthe box already.\xe2\x80\x9d And he had fixed his eyes with a demonstrative stare\r\nupon M. de Bellegarde. Valentin had promptly retorted that if there\r\nwere too many people in the box it was easy for M. Kapp to diminish the\r\nnumber. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall be most happy to open the door for _you!_\xe2\x80\x9d M. Kapp\r\nexclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall be delighted to fling you into the pit!\xe2\x80\x9d Valentin\r\nhad answered. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, do make a rumpus and get into the papers!\xe2\x80\x9d Miss\r\nNo\xc3\xa9mie had gleefully ejaculated. \xe2\x80\x9cM. Kapp, turn him out; or, M. de\r\nBellegarde, pitch him into the pit, into the orchestra\xe2\x80\x94anywhere! I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t care who does which, so long as you make a scene.\xe2\x80\x9d Valentin\r\nanswered that they would make no scene, but that the gentleman would be\r\nso good as to step into the corridor with him. In the corridor, after a\r\nbrief further exchange of words, there had been an exchange of cards.\r\nM. Stanislas Kapp was very stiff. He evidently meant to force his\r\noffence home.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe man, no doubt, was insolent,\xe2\x80\x9d Newman said; \xe2\x80\x9cbut if you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t gone\r\nback into the box the thing wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have happened.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see,\xe2\x80\x9d Valentin replied, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the event proves the\r\nextreme propriety of my going back into the box? M. Kapp wished to\r\nprovoke me; he was awaiting his chance. In such a case\xe2\x80\x94that is, when he\r\nhas been, so to speak, notified\xe2\x80\x94a man must be on hand to receive the\r\nprovocation. My not returning would simply have been tantamount to my\r\nsaying to M. Stanislas Kapp, \xe2\x80\x98Oh, if you are going to be\r\ndisagreeable\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98You must manage it by yourself; damned if I\xe2\x80\x99ll help you!\xe2\x80\x99 That would\r\nhave been a thoroughly sensible thing to say. The only attraction for\r\nyou seems to have been the prospect of M. Kapp\xe2\x80\x99s impertinence,\xe2\x80\x9d Newman\r\nwent on. \xe2\x80\x9cYou told me you were not going back for that girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t mention that girl any more,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Valentin. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nbore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith all my heart. But if that is the way you feel about her, why\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you let her alone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nValentin shook his head with a fine smile. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think you quite\r\nunderstand, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe I can make you. She understood the\r\nsituation; she knew what was in the air; she was watching us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA cat may look at a king! What difference does that make?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, a man can\xe2\x80\x99t back down before a woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t call her a woman. You said yourself she was a stone,\xe2\x80\x9d cried\r\nNewman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d Valentin rejoined, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no disputing about tastes. It\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nmatter of feeling; it\xe2\x80\x99s measured by one\xe2\x80\x99s sense of honor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, confound your sense of honor!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is vain talking,\xe2\x80\x9d said Valentin; \xe2\x80\x9cwords have passed, and the thing\r\nis settled.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman turned away, taking his hat. Then pausing with his hand on the\r\ndoor, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you going to use?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is for M. Stanislas Kapp, as the challenged party, to decide. My\r\nown choice would be a short, light sword. I handle it well. I\xe2\x80\x99m an\r\nindifferent shot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman had put on his hat; he pushed it back, gently scratching his\r\nforehead, high up. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish it were pistols,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI could show you\r\nhow to lodge a bullet!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nValentin broke into a laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it some English poet says about\r\nconsistency? It\xe2\x80\x99s a flower, or a star, or a jewel. Yours has the beauty\r\nof all three!\xe2\x80\x9d But he agreed to see Newman again on the morrow, after\r\nthe details of his meeting with M. Stanislas Kapp should have been\r\narranged.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the day Newman received three lines from him, saying\r\nthat it had been decided that he should cross the frontier, with his\r\nadversary, and that he was to take the night express to Geneva. He\r\nshould have time, however, to dine with Newman. In the afternoon Newman\r\ncalled upon Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9, but his visit was brief. She was as\r\ngracious and sympathetic as he had ever found her, but she was sad, and\r\nshe confessed, on Newman\xe2\x80\x99s charging her with her red eyes, that she had\r\nbeen crying. Valentin had been with her a couple of hours before, and\r\nhis visit had left her with a painful impression. He had laughed and\r\ngossiped, he had brought her no bad news, he had only been, in his\r\nmanner, rather more affectionate than usual. His fraternal tenderness\r\nhad touched her, and on his departure she had burst into tears. She had\r\nfelt as if something strange and sad were going to happen; she had\r\ntried to reason away the fancy, and the effort had only given her a\r\nheadache. Newman, of course, was perforce tongue-tied about Valentin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nprojected duel, and his dramatic talent was not equal to satirizing\r\nMadame de Cintr\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s presentiment as pointedly as perfect security\r\ndemanded. Before he went away he asked Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 whether\r\nValentin had seen his mother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut he didn\xe2\x80\x99t make her cry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was in Newman\xe2\x80\x99s own apartment that Valentin dined, having brought\r\nhis portmanteau, so that he might adjourn directly to the railway. M.\r\nStanislas Kapp had positively declined to make excuses, and he, on his\r\nside, obviously, had none to offer. Valentin had found out with whom he\r\nwas dealing. M. Stanislas Kapp was the son of and heir of a rich brewer\r\nof Strasbourg, a youth of a sanguineous\xe2\x80\x94and sanguinary\xe2\x80\x94temperament. He\r\nwas making ducks and drakes of the paternal brewery, and although he\r\npassed in a general way for a good fellow, he had already been observed\r\nto be quarrelsome after dinner. \xe2\x80\x9c_Que voulez-vous?_\xe2\x80\x9d said Valentin.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBrought up on beer, he can\xe2\x80\x99t stand champagne.\xe2\x80\x9d He had chosen pistols.\r\nValentin, at dinner, had an excellent appetite; he made a point, in\r\nview of his long journey, of eating more than usual. He took the\r\nliberty of suggesting to Newman a slight modification in the\r\ncomposition of a certain fish-sauce; he thought it would be worth\r\nmentioning to the cook. But Newman had no thoughts for fish-sauce; he\r\nfelt thoroughly discontented. As he sat and watched his amiable and\r\nclever companion going through his excellent repast with the delicate\r\ndeliberation of hereditary epicurism, the folly of so charming a fellow\r\ntraveling off to expose his agreeable young life for the sake of M.\r\nStanislas and Mademoiselle No\xc3\xa9mie struck him with intolerable force. He\r\nhad grown fond of Valentin, he felt now how fond; and his sense of\r\nhelplessness only increased his irritation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, this sort of thing may be all very well,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried at last, \xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\nI declare I don\xe2\x80\x99t see it. I can\xe2\x80\x99t stop you, perhaps, but at least I can\r\nprotest. I do protest, violently.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear fellow, don\xe2\x80\x99t make a scene,\xe2\x80\x9d said Valentin. \xe2\x80\x9cScenes in these\r\ncases are in very bad taste.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour duel itself is a scene,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman; \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s all it is! It\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nwretched theatrical affair. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you take a band of music with you\r\noutright? It\xe2\x80\x99s d\xe2\x80\x94d barbarous and it\xe2\x80\x99s d\xe2\x80\x94d corrupt, both.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I can\xe2\x80\x99t begin, at this time of day, to defend the theory of\r\ndueling,\xe2\x80\x9d said Valentin. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is our custom, and I think it is a good\r\nthing. Quite apart from the goodness of the cause in which a duel may\r\nbe fought, it has a kind of picturesque charm which in this age of vile\r\nprose seems to me greatly to recommend it. It\xe2\x80\x99s a remnant of a\r\nhigher-tempered time; one ought to cling to it. Depend upon it, a duel\r\nis never amiss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you mean by a higher-tempered time,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause your great-grandfather was an ass, is that any reason why you\r\nshould be? For my part I think we had better let our temper take care\r\nof itself; it generally seems to me quite high enough; I am not afraid\r\nof being too meek. If your great-grandfather were to make himself\r\nunpleasant to me, I think I could manage him yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said Valentin, smiling, \xe2\x80\x9cyou can\xe2\x80\x99t invent anything\r\nthat will take the place of satisfaction for an insult. To demand it\r\nand to give it are equally excellent arrangements.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you call this sort of thing satisfaction?\xe2\x80\x9d Newman asked. \xe2\x80\x9cDoes it\r\nsatisfy you to receive a present of the carcass of that coarse fop?\r\ndoes it gratify you to make him a present of yours? If a man hits you,\r\nhit him back; if a man libels you, haul him up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaul him up, into court? Oh, that is very nasty!\xe2\x80\x9d said Valentin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe nastiness is his\xe2\x80\x94not yours. And for that matter, what you are\r\ndoing is not particularly nice. You are too good for it. I don\xe2\x80\x99t say\r\nyou are the most useful man in the world, or the cleverest, or the most\r\namiable. But you are too good to go and get your throat cut for a\r\nprostitute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nValentin flushed a little, but he laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cI shan\xe2\x80\x99t get my throat cut\r\nif I can help it. Moreover, one\xe2\x80\x99s honor hasn\xe2\x80\x99t two different measures.\r\nIt only knows that it is hurt; it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t ask when, or how, or where.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe more fool it is!\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\nValentin ceased to laugh; he looked grave. \xe2\x80\x9cI beg you not to say any\r\nmore,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you do I shall almost fancy you don\xe2\x80\x99t care\r\nabout\xe2\x80\x94about\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and he paused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout that matter\xe2\x80\x94about one\xe2\x80\x99s honor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFancy what you please,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cFancy while you are at it that I\r\ncare about _you_\xe2\x80\x94though you are not worth it. But come back without\r\ndamage,\xe2\x80\x9d he added in a moment, \xe2\x80\x9cand I will forgive you. And then,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncontinued, as Valentin was going, \xe2\x80\x9cI will ship you straight off to\r\nAmerica.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Valentin, \xe2\x80\x9cif I am to turn over a new page, this may\r\nfigure as a tail-piece to the old.\xe2\x80\x9d And then he lit another cigar and\r\ndeparted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBlast that girl!\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman as the door closed upon Valentin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nNewman went the next morning to see Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9, timing his visit\r\nso as to arrive after the noonday breakfast. In the court of the\r\n_h\xc3\xb4tel_, before the portico, stood Madame de Bellegarde\xe2\x80\x99s old square\r\ncarriage. The servant who opened the door answered Newman\xe2\x80\x99s inquiry\r\nwith a slightly embarrassed and hesitating murmur, and at the same\r\nmoment Mrs. Bread appeared in the background, dim-visaged as usual, and\r\nwearing a large black bonnet and shawl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cIs Madame la Comtesse at home, or\r\nnot?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Bread advanced, fixing her eyes upon him: he observed that she\r\nheld a sealed letter, very delicately, in her fingers. \xe2\x80\x9cThe countess\r\nhas left a message for you, sir; she has left this,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bread,\r\nholding out the letter, which Newman took.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeft it? Is she out? Is she gone away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is going away, sir; she is leaving town,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bread.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeaving town!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat has happened?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not for me to say, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bread, with her eyes on the\r\nground. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I thought it would come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat would come, pray?\xe2\x80\x9d Newman demanded. He had broken the seal of the\r\nletter, but he still questioned. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is in the house? She is visible?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think she expected you this morning,\xe2\x80\x9d the old waiting-woman\r\nreplied. \xe2\x80\x9cShe was to leave immediately.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is she going?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo Fleuri\xc3\xa8res.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo Fleuri\xc3\xa8res? But surely I can see her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Bread hesitated a moment, and then clasping together her two\r\nhands, \xe2\x80\x9cI will take you!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. And she led the way upstairs. At\r\nthe top of the staircase she paused and fixed her dry, sad eyes upon\r\nNewman. \xe2\x80\x9cBe very easy with her,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cshe is most unhappy!\xe2\x80\x9d Then\r\nshe went on to Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s apartment; Newman, perplexed and\r\nalarmed, followed her rapidly. Mrs. Bread threw open the door, and\r\nNewman pushed back the curtain at the farther side of its deep\r\nembrasure. In the middle of the room stood Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9; her face\r\nwas pale and she was dressed for traveling. Behind her, before the\r\nfire-place, stood Urbain de Bellegarde, looking at his finger-nails;\r\nnear the marquis sat his mother, buried in an armchair, and with her\r\neyes immediately fixing themselves upon Newman. He felt, as soon as he\r\nentered the room, that he was in the presence of something evil; he was\r\nstartled and pained, as he would have been by a threatening cry in the\r\nstillness of the night. He walked straight to Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 and\r\nseized her by the hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked commandingly; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat is happening?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUrbain de Bellegarde stared, then left his place and came and leaned\r\nupon his mother\xe2\x80\x99s chair, behind. Newman\xe2\x80\x99s sudden irruption had\r\nevidently discomposed both mother and son. Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 stood\r\nsilent, with her eyes resting upon Newman\xe2\x80\x99s. She had often looked at\r\nhim with all her soul, as it seemed to him; but in this present gaze\r\nthere was a sort of bottomless depth. She was in distress; it was the\r\nmost touching thing he had ever seen. His heart rose into his throat,\r\nand he was on the point of turning to her companions, with an angry\r\nchallenge; but she checked him, pressing the hand that held her own.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething very grave has happened,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot marry you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman dropped her hand and stood staring, first at her and then at the\r\nothers. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, as quietly as possible.\r\n\r\nMadame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 almost smiled, but the attempt was strange. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must\r\nask my mother, you must ask my brother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy can\xe2\x80\x99t she marry me?\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, looking at them.\r\n\r\nMadame de Bellegarde did not move in her place, but she was as pale as\r\nher daughter. The marquis looked down at her. She said nothing for some\r\nmoments, but she kept her keen, clear eyes upon Newman, bravely. The\r\nmarquis drew himself up and looked at the ceiling. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s impossible!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said softly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s improper,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de Bellegarde.\r\n\r\nNewman began to laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, you are fooling!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy sister, you have no time; you are losing your train,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nmarquis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, is he mad?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; don\xe2\x80\x99t think that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I am going away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you going?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the country, to Fleuri\xc3\xa8res; to be alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo leave me?\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, slowly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t see you, now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Now_\xe2\x80\x94why not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am ashamed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9, simply.\r\n\r\nNewman turned toward the marquis. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you done to her\xe2\x80\x94what does\r\nit mean?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked with the same effort at calmness, the fruit of his\r\nconstant practice in taking things easily. He was excited, but\r\nexcitement with him was only an intenser deliberateness; it was the\r\nswimmer stripped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt means that I have given you up,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9. \xe2\x80\x9cIt means\r\nthat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer face was too charged with tragic expression not fully to confirm\r\nher words. Newman was profoundly shocked, but he felt as yet no\r\nresentment against her. He was amazed, bewildered, and the presence of\r\nthe old marquise and her son seemed to smite his eyes like the glare of\r\na watchman\xe2\x80\x99s lantern. \xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t I see you alone?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be only more painful. I hoped I should not see you\xe2\x80\x94I should\r\nescape. I wrote to you. Good-bye.\xe2\x80\x9d And she put out her hand again.\r\n\r\nNewman put both his own into his pockets. \xe2\x80\x9cI will go with you,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nShe laid her two hands on his arm. \xe2\x80\x9cWill you grant me a last request?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand as she looked at him, urging this, her eyes filled with tears. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\r\nme go alone\xe2\x80\x94let me go in peace. I can\xe2\x80\x99t call it peace\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s death. But\r\nlet me bury myself. So\xe2\x80\x94good-bye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman passed his hand into his hair and stood slowly rubbing his head\r\nand looking through his keenly-narrowed eyes from one to the other of\r\nthe three persons before him. His lips were compressed, and the two\r\nlines which had formed themselves beside his mouth might have made it\r\nappear at a first glance that he was smiling. I have said that his\r\nexcitement was an intenser deliberateness, and now he looked grimly\r\ndeliberate. \xe2\x80\x9cIt seems very much as if you had interfered, marquis,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid slowly. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought you said you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t interfere. I know you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t like me; but that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make any difference. I thought you\r\npromised me you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t interfere. I thought you swore on your honor\r\nthat you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t interfere. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you remember, marquis?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe marquis lifted his eyebrows; but he was apparently determined to be\r\neven more urbane than usual. He rested his two hands upon the back of\r\nhis mother\xe2\x80\x99s chair and bent forward, as if he were leaning over the\r\nedge of a pulpit or a lecture-desk. He did not smile, but he looked\r\nsoftly grave. \xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI assured you that I would\r\nnot influence my sister\xe2\x80\x99s decision. I adhered, to the letter, to my\r\nengagement. Did I not, sister?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t appeal, my son,\xe2\x80\x9d said the marquise, \xe2\x80\x9cyour word is sufficient.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94she accepted me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is very true, I can\xe2\x80\x99t deny\r\nthat. At least,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, in a different tone, turning to Madame de\r\nCintr\xc3\xa9, \xe2\x80\x9cyou _did_ accept me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSomething in the tone seemed to move her strongly. She turned away,\r\nburying her face in her hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you have interfered now, haven\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Newman of the\r\nmarquis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNeither then nor now have I attempted to influence my sister. I used\r\nno persuasion then, I have used no persuasion to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what have you used?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have used authority,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de Bellegarde in a rich,\r\nbell-like voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you have used authority,\xe2\x80\x9d Newman exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cThey have used\r\nauthority,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, turning to Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it? how\r\ndid they use it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy mother commanded,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCommanded you to give me up\xe2\x80\x94I see. And you obey\xe2\x80\x94I see. But why do you\r\nobey?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Newman.\r\n\r\nMadame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 looked across at the old marquise; her eyes slowly\r\nmeasured her from head to foot. \xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid of my mother,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nMadame de Bellegarde rose with a certain quickness, crying, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is a\r\nmost indecent scene!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no wish to prolong it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9; and turning to\r\nthe door she put out her hand again. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you can pity me a little, let\r\nme go alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman shook her hand quietly and firmly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll come down there,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid. The _porti\xc3\xa8re_ dropped behind her, and Newman sank with a long\r\nbreath into the nearest chair. He leaned back in it, resting his hands\r\non the knobs of the arms and looking at Madame de Bellegarde and\r\nUrbain. There was a long silence. They stood side by side, with their\r\nheads high and their handsome eyebrows arched.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you make a distinction?\xe2\x80\x9d Newman said at last. \xe2\x80\x9cYou make a\r\ndistinction between persuading and commanding? It\xe2\x80\x99s very neat. But the\r\ndistinction is in favor of commanding. That rather spoils it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have not the least objection to defining our position,\xe2\x80\x9d said M. de\r\nBellegarde. \xe2\x80\x9cWe understand that it should not at first appear to you\r\nquite clear. We rather expected, indeed, that you should not do us\r\njustice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99ll do you justice,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid. Please\r\nproceed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe marquise laid her hand on her son\xe2\x80\x99s arm, as if to deprecate the\r\nattempt to define their position. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is quite useless,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cto\r\ntry and arrange this matter so as to make it agreeable to you. It can\r\nnever be agreeable to you. It is a disappointment, and disappointments\r\nare unpleasant. I thought it over carefully and tried to arrange it\r\nbetter; but I only gave myself a headache and lost my sleep. Say what\r\nwe will, you will think yourself ill-treated, and you will publish your\r\nwrongs among your friends. But we are not afraid of that. Besides, your\r\nfriends are not our friends, and it will not matter. Think of us as you\r\nplease. I only beg you not to be violent. I have never in my life been\r\npresent at a violent scene of any kind, and at my age I can\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nexpected to begin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs _that_ all you have got to say?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Newman, slowly rising out of\r\nhis chair. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a poor show for a clever lady like you, marquise.\r\nCome, try again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy mother goes to the point, with her usual honesty and intrepidity,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the marquis, toying with his watch-guard. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it is perhaps well\r\nto say a little more. We of course quite repudiate the charge of having\r\nbroken faith with you. We left you entirely at liberty to make yourself\r\nagreeable to my sister. We left her quite at liberty to entertain your\r\nproposal. When she accepted you we said nothing. We therefore quite\r\nobserved our promise. It was only at a later stage of the affair, and\r\non quite a different basis, as it were, that we determined to speak. It\r\nwould have been better, perhaps, if we had spoken before. But really,\r\nyou see, nothing has yet been done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing has yet been done?\xe2\x80\x9d Newman repeated the words, unconscious of\r\ntheir comical effect. He had lost the sense of what the marquis was\r\nsaying; M. de Bellegarde\xe2\x80\x99s superior style was a mere humming in his\r\nears. All that he understood, in his deep and simple indignation, was\r\nthat the matter was not a violent joke, and that the people before him\r\nwere perfectly serious. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you suppose I can take this?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cDo\r\nyou suppose it can matter to me what you say? Do you suppose I can\r\nseriously listen to you? You are simply crazy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame de Bellegarde gave a rap with her fan in the palm of her hand.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you don\xe2\x80\x99t take it you can leave it, sir. It matters very little\r\nwhat you do. My daughter has given you up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean it,\xe2\x80\x9d Newman declared after a moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I can assure you that she does,\xe2\x80\x9d said the marquis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor woman, what damnable thing have you done to her?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGently, gently!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured M. de Bellegarde.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe told you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old lady. \xe2\x80\x9cI commanded her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman shook his head, heavily. \xe2\x80\x9cThis sort of thing can\xe2\x80\x99t be, you\r\nknow,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cA man can\xe2\x80\x99t be used in this fashion. You have got no\r\nright; you have got no power.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy power,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de Bellegarde, \xe2\x80\x9cis in my children\xe2\x80\x99s obedience.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn their fear, your daughter said. There is something very strange in\r\nit. Why should your daughter be afraid of you?\xe2\x80\x9d added Newman, after\r\nlooking a moment at the old lady. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is some foul play.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe marquise met his gaze without flinching, and as if she did not hear\r\nor heed what he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI did my best,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, quietly. \xe2\x80\x9cI could\r\nendure it no longer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a bold experiment!\xe2\x80\x9d said the marquis.\r\n\r\nNewman felt disposed to walk to him, clutch his neck with his fingers\r\nand press his windpipe with his thumb. \xe2\x80\x9cI needn\xe2\x80\x99t tell you how you\r\nstrike me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cof course you know that. But I should think you\r\nwould be afraid of your friends\xe2\x80\x94all those people you introduced me to\r\nthe other night. There were some very nice people among them; you may\r\ndepend upon it there were some honest men and women.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur friends approve us,\xe2\x80\x9d said M. de Bellegarde, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is not a family\r\namong them that would have acted otherwise. And however that may be, we\r\ntake the cue from no one. The Bellegardes have been used to set the\r\nexample, not to wait for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou would have waited long before anyone would have set you such an\r\nexample as this,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cHave I done anything wrong?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ndemanded. \xe2\x80\x9cHave I given you reason to change your opinion? Have you\r\nfound out anything against me? I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur opinion,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de Bellegarde, \xe2\x80\x9cis quite the same as at\r\nfirst\xe2\x80\x94exactly. We have no ill-will towards yourself; we are very far\r\nfrom accusing you of misconduct. Since your relations with us began you\r\nhave been, I frankly confess, less\xe2\x80\x94less peculiar than I expected. It is\r\nnot your disposition that we object to, it is your antecedents. We\r\nreally cannot reconcile ourselves to a commercial person. We fancied in\r\nan evil hour that we could; it was a great misfortune. We determined to\r\npersevere to the end, and to give you every advantage. I was resolved\r\nthat you should have no reason to accuse me of want of loyalty. We let\r\nthe thing certainly go very far; we introduced you to our friends. To\r\ntell the truth, it was that, I think, that broke me down. I succumbed\r\nto the scene that took place on Thursday night in these rooms. You must\r\nexcuse me if what I say is disagreeable to you, but we cannot release\r\nourselves without an explanation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere can be no better proof of our good faith,\xe2\x80\x9d said the marquis,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthan our committing ourselves to you in the eyes of the world the\r\nother evening. We endeavored to bind ourselves\xe2\x80\x94to tie our hands, as it\r\nwere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it was that,\xe2\x80\x9d added his mother, \xe2\x80\x9cthat opened our eyes and broke\r\nour bonds. We should have been most uncomfortable! You know,\xe2\x80\x9d she added\r\nin a moment, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you were forewarned. I told you we were very proud.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman took up his hat and began mechanically to smooth it; the very\r\nfierceness of his scorn kept him from speaking. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are not proud\r\nenough,\xe2\x80\x9d he observed at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn all this matter,\xe2\x80\x9d said the marquis, smiling, \xe2\x80\x9cI really see nothing\r\nbut our humility.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us have no more discussion than is necessary,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Madame de\r\nBellegarde. \xe2\x80\x9cMy daughter told you everything when she said she gave you\r\nup.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not satisfied about your daughter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman; \xe2\x80\x9cI want to know\r\nwhat you did to her. It is all very easy talking about authority and\r\nsaying you commanded her. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t accept me blindly, and she\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have given me up blindly. Not that I believe yet she has\r\nreally given me up; she will talk it over with me. But you have\r\nfrightened her, you have bullied her, you have _hurt_ her. What was it\r\nyou did to her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did very little!\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de Bellegarde, in a tone which gave\r\nNewman a chill when he afterwards remembered it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me remind you that we offered you these explanations,\xe2\x80\x9d the marquis\r\nobserved, \xe2\x80\x9cwith the express understanding that you should abstain from\r\nviolence of language.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not violent,\xe2\x80\x9d Newman answered, \xe2\x80\x9cit is you who are violent! But I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know that I have much more to say to you. What you expect of me,\r\napparently, is to go my way, thanking you for favors received, and\r\npromising never to trouble you again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe expect of you to act like a clever man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de Bellegarde.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have shown yourself that already, and what we have done is\r\naltogether based upon your being so. When one must submit, one must.\r\nSince my daughter absolutely withdraws, what will be the use of your\r\nmaking a noise?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt remains to be seen whether your daughter absolutely withdraws. Your\r\ndaughter and I are still very good friends; nothing is changed in that.\r\nAs I say, I will talk it over with her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat will be of no use,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old lady. \xe2\x80\x9cI know my daughter well\r\nenough to know that words spoken as she just now spoke to you are\r\nfinal. Besides, she has promised me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no doubt her promise is worth a great deal more than your own,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Newman; \xe2\x80\x9cnevertheless I don\xe2\x80\x99t give her up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust as you please! But if she won\xe2\x80\x99t even see you,\xe2\x80\x94and she won\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x94your\r\nconstancy must remain purely Platonic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoor Newman was feigning a greater confidence than he felt. Madame de\r\nCintr\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s strange intensity had in fact struck a chill to his heart; her\r\nface, still impressed upon his vision, had been a terribly vivid image\r\nof renunciation. He felt sick, and suddenly helpless. He turned away\r\nand stood for a moment with his hand on the door; then he faced about\r\nand after the briefest hesitation broke out with a different accent.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, think of what this must be to me, and let her alone! Why should\r\nyou object to me so\xe2\x80\x94what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with me? I can\xe2\x80\x99t hurt you. I\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t if I could. I\xe2\x80\x99m the most unobjectionable fellow in the world.\r\nWhat if I am a commercial person? What under the sun do you mean? A\r\ncommercial person? I will be any sort of a person you want. I never\r\ntalked to you about business. Let her go, and I will ask no questions.\r\nI will take her away, and you shall never see me or hear of me again. I\r\nwill stay in America if you like. I\xe2\x80\x99ll sign a paper promising never to\r\ncome back to Europe! All I want is not to lose her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame de Bellegarde and her son exchanged a glance of lucid irony, and\r\nUrbain said, \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear sir, what you propose is hardly an improvement.\r\nWe have not the slightest objection to seeing you, as an amiable\r\nforeigner, and we have every reason for not wishing to be eternally\r\nseparated from my sister. We object to the marriage; and in that way,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand M. de Bellegarde gave a small, thin laugh, \xe2\x80\x9cshe would be more\r\nmarried than ever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere is this place of yours\xe2\x80\x94Fleuri\xc3\xa8res? I\r\nknow it is near some old city on a hill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrecisely. Poitiers is on a hill,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de Bellegarde. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow how old it is. We are not afraid to tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is Poitiers, is it? Very good,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall immediately\r\nfollow Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe trains after this hour won\xe2\x80\x99t serve you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Urbain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall hire a special train!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat will be a very silly waste of money,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de Bellegarde.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will be time enough to talk about waste three days hence,\xe2\x80\x9d Newman\r\nanswered; and clapping his hat on his head, he departed.\r\n\r\nHe did not immediately start for Fleuri\xc3\xa8res; he was too stunned and\r\nwounded for consecutive action. He simply walked; he walked straight\r\nbefore him, following the river, till he got out of the _enceinte_ of\r\nParis. He had a burning, tingling sense of personal outrage. He had\r\nnever in his life received so absolute a check; he had never been\r\npulled up, or, as he would have said, \xe2\x80\x9clet down,\xe2\x80\x9d so short; and he\r\nfound the sensation intolerable; he strode along, tapping the trees and\r\nlamp-posts fiercely with his stick and inwardly raging. To lose Madame\r\nde Cintr\xc3\xa9 after he had taken such jubilant and triumphant possession of\r\nher was as great an affront to his pride as it was an injury to his\r\nhappiness. And to lose her by the interference and the dictation of\r\nothers, by an impudent old woman and a pretentious fop stepping in with\r\ntheir \xe2\x80\x9cauthority\xe2\x80\x9d! It was too preposterous, it was too pitiful. Upon\r\nwhat he deemed the unblushing treachery of the Bellegardes Newman\r\nwasted little thought; he consigned it, once for all, to eternal\r\nperdition. But the treachery of Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 herself amazed and\r\nconfounded him; there was a key to the mystery, of course, but he\r\ngroped for it in vain. Only three days had elapsed since she stood\r\nbeside him in the starlight, beautiful and tranquil as the trust with\r\nwhich he had inspired her, and told him that she was happy in the\r\nprospect of their marriage. What was the meaning of the change? of what\r\ninfernal potion had she tasted? Poor Newman had a terrible apprehension\r\nthat she had really changed. His very admiration for her attached the\r\nidea of force and weight to her rupture. But he did not rail at her as\r\nfalse, for he was sure she was unhappy. In his walk he had crossed one\r\nof the bridges of the Seine, and he still followed, unheedingly, the\r\nlong, unbroken quay. He had left Paris behind him, and he was almost in\r\nthe country; he was in the pleasant suburb of Auteuil. He stopped at\r\nlast, looked around him without seeing or caring for its pleasantness,\r\nand then slowly turned and at a slower pace retraced his steps. When he\r\ncame abreast of the fantastic embankment known as the Trocadero, he\r\nreflected, through his throbbing pain, that he was near Mrs. Tristram\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndwelling, and that Mrs. Tristram, on particular occasions, had much of\r\na woman\xe2\x80\x99s kindness in her utterance. He felt that he needed to pour out\r\nhis ire and he took the road to her house. Mrs. Tristram was at home\r\nand alone, and as soon as she had looked at him, on his entering the\r\nroom, she told him that she knew what he had come for. Newman sat down\r\nheavily, in silence, looking at her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey have backed out!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, you may think it strange, but\r\nI felt something the other night in the air.\xe2\x80\x9d Presently he told her his\r\nstory; she listened, with her eyes fixed on him. When he had finished\r\nshe said quietly, \xe2\x80\x9cThey want her to marry Lord Deepmere.\xe2\x80\x9d Newman\r\nstared. He did not know that she knew anything about Lord Deepmere.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t think she will,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Tristram added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_She_ marry that poor little cub!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Lord! And yet,\r\nwhy did she refuse me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that isn\xe2\x80\x99t the only thing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Tristram. \xe2\x80\x9cThey really\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t endure you any longer. They had overrated their courage. I\r\nmust say, to give the devil his due, that there is something rather\r\nfine in that. It was your commercial quality in the abstract they\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t swallow. That is really aristocratic. They wanted your money,\r\nbut they have given you up for an idea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman frowned most ruefully, and took up his hat again. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought you\r\nwould encourage me!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with almost childlike sadness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered very gently. \xe2\x80\x9cI feel none the less sorry for\r\nyou, especially as I am at the bottom of your troubles. I have not\r\nforgotten that I suggested the marriage to you. I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that\r\nMadame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 has any intention of marrying Lord Deepmere. It is\r\ntrue he is not younger than she, as he looks. He is thirty-three years\r\nold; I looked in the Peerage. But no\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe her so horribly,\r\ncruelly false.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease say nothing against her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor woman, she _is_ cruel. But of course you will go after her and\r\nyou will plead powerfully. Do you know that as you are now,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs.\r\nTristram pursued, with characteristic audacity of comment, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are\r\nextremely eloquent, even without speaking? To resist you a woman must\r\nhave a very fixed idea in her head. I wish I had done you a wrong, that\r\nyou might come to me in that fine fashion! But go to Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9\r\nat any rate, and tell her that she is a puzzle even to me. I am very\r\ncurious to see how far family discipline will go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman sat a while longer, leaning his elbows on his knees and his head\r\nin his hands, and Mrs. Tristram continued to temper charity with\r\nphilosophy and compassion with criticism. At last she inquired, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nwhat does the Count Valentin say to it?\xe2\x80\x9d Newman started; he had not\r\nthought of Valentin and his errand on the Swiss frontier since the\r\nmorning. The reflection made him restless again, and he took his leave.\r\nHe went straight to his apartment, where, upon the table of the\r\nvestibule, he found a telegram. It ran (with the date and place) as\r\nfollows: \xe2\x80\x9cI am seriously ill; please to come to me as soon as possible.\r\nV. B.\xe2\x80\x9d Newman groaned at this miserable news, and at the necessity of\r\ndeferring his journey to the Ch\xc3\xa2teau de Fleuri\xc3\xa8res. But he wrote to\r\nMadame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 these few lines; they were all he had time for:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t give you up, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t really believe you give me up. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t understand it, but we shall clear it up together. I can\xe2\x80\x99t follow\r\nyou to-day, as I am called to see a friend at a distance who is very\r\nill, perhaps dying. But I shall come to you as soon as I can leave my\r\nfriend. Why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I say that he is your brother? C. N.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter this he had only time to catch the night express to Geneva.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n\r\nNewman possessed a remarkable talent for sitting still when it was\r\nnecessary, and he had an opportunity to use it on his journey to\r\nSwitzerland. The successive hours of the night brought him no sleep,\r\nbut he sat motionless in his corner of the railway-carriage, with his\r\neyes closed, and the most observant of his fellow-travelers might have\r\nenvied him his apparent slumber. Toward morning slumber really came, as\r\nan effect of mental rather than of physical fatigue. He slept for a\r\ncouple of hours, and at last, waking, found his eyes resting upon one\r\nof the snow-powdered peaks of the Jura, behind which the sky was just\r\nreddening with the dawn. But he saw neither the cold mountain nor the\r\nwarm sky; his consciousness began to throb again, on the very instant,\r\nwith a sense of his wrong. He got out of the train half an hour before\r\nit reached Geneva, in the cold morning twilight, at the station\r\nindicated in Valentin\xe2\x80\x99s telegram. A drowsy station-master was on the\r\nplatform with a lantern, and the hood of his overcoat over his head,\r\nand near him stood a gentleman who advanced to meet Newman. This\r\npersonage was a man of forty, with a tall lean figure, a sallow face, a\r\ndark eye, a neat moustache, and a pair of fresh gloves. He took off his\r\nhat, looking very grave, and pronounced Newman\xe2\x80\x99s name. Our hero\r\nassented and said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou are M. de Bellegarde\xe2\x80\x99s friend?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI unite with you in claiming that sad honor,\xe2\x80\x9d said the gentleman. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nhad placed myself at M. de Bellegarde\xe2\x80\x99s service in this melancholy\r\naffair, together with M. de Grosjoyaux, who is now at his bedside. M.\r\nde Grosjoyaux, I believe, has had the honor of meeting you in Paris,\r\nbut as he is a better nurse than I he remained with our poor friend.\r\nBellegarde has been eagerly expecting you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how is Bellegarde?\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was badly hit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe doctor has condemned him; we brought a surgeon with us. But he\r\nwill die in the best sentiments. I sent last evening for the cur\xc3\xa9 of\r\nthe nearest French village, who spent an hour with him. The cur\xc3\xa9 was\r\nquite satisfied.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeaven forgive us!\xe2\x80\x9d groaned Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cI would rather the doctor were\r\nsatisfied! And can he see me\xe2\x80\x94shall he know me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I left him, half an hour ago, he had fallen asleep after a\r\nfeverish, wakeful night. But we shall see.\xe2\x80\x9d And Newman\xe2\x80\x99s companion\r\nproceeded to lead the way out of the station to the village, explaining\r\nas he went that the little party was lodged in the humblest of Swiss\r\ninns, where, however, they had succeeded in making M. de Bellegarde\r\nmuch more comfortable than could at first have been expected. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are\r\nold companions in arms,\xe2\x80\x9d said Valentin\xe2\x80\x99s second; \xe2\x80\x9cit is not the first\r\ntime that one of us has helped the other to lie easily. It is a very\r\nnasty wound, and the nastiest thing about it is that Bellegarde\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nadversary was not shot. He put his bullet where he could. It took it\r\ninto its head to walk straight into Bellegarde\xe2\x80\x99s left side, just below\r\nthe heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs they picked their way in the gray, deceptive dawn, between the\r\nmanure-heaps of the village street, Newman\xe2\x80\x99s new acquaintance narrated\r\nthe particulars of the duel. The conditions of the meeting had been\r\nthat if the first exchange of shots should fail to satisfy one of the\r\ntwo gentlemen, a second should take place. Valentin\xe2\x80\x99s first bullet had\r\ndone exactly what Newman\xe2\x80\x99s companion was convinced he had intended it\r\nto do; it had grazed the arm of M. Stanislas Kapp, just scratching the\r\nflesh. M. Kapp\xe2\x80\x99s own projectile, meanwhile, had passed at ten good\r\ninches from the person of Valentin. The representatives of M. Stanislas\r\nhad demanded another shot, which was granted. Valentin had then fired\r\naside and the young Alsatian had done effective execution. \xe2\x80\x9cI saw, when\r\nwe met him on the ground,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman\xe2\x80\x99s informant, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he was not\r\ngoing to be _commode_. It is a kind of bovine temperament.\xe2\x80\x9d Valentin\r\nhad immediately been installed at the inn, and M. Stanislas and his\r\nfriends had withdrawn to regions unknown. The police authorities of the\r\ncanton had waited upon the party at the inn, had been extremely\r\nmajestic, and had drawn up a long _proc\xc3\xa8s-verbal_; but it was probable\r\nthat they would wink at so very gentlemanly a bit of bloodshed. Newman\r\nasked whether a message had not been sent to Valentin\xe2\x80\x99s family, and\r\nlearned that up to a late hour on the preceding evening Valentin had\r\nopposed it. He had refused to believe his wound was dangerous. But\r\nafter his interview with the cur\xc3\xa9 he had consented, and a telegram had\r\nbeen dispatched to his mother. \xe2\x80\x9cBut the marquise had better hurry!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Newman\xe2\x80\x99s conductor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it\xe2\x80\x99s an abominable affair!\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all I have to\r\nsay!\xe2\x80\x9d To say this, at least, in a tone of infinite disgust was an\r\nirresistible need.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you don\xe2\x80\x99t approve?\xe2\x80\x9d questioned his conductor, with curious\r\nurbanity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cApprove?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish that when I had him there, night\r\nbefore last, I had locked him up in my _cabinet de toilette!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nValentin\xe2\x80\x99s late second opened his eyes, and shook his head up and down\r\ntwo or three times, gravely, with a little flute-like whistle. But they\r\nhad reached the inn, and a stout maid-servant in a night-cap was at the\r\ndoor with a lantern, to take Newman\xe2\x80\x99s traveling-bag from the porter who\r\ntrudged behind him. Valentin was lodged on the ground-floor at the back\r\nof the house, and Newman\xe2\x80\x99s companion went along a stone-faced passage\r\nand softly opened a door. Then he beckoned to Newman, who advanced and\r\nlooked into the room, which was lighted by a single shaded candle.\r\nBeside the fire sat M. de Grosjoyaux asleep in his dressing-gown\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nlittle plump, fair man whom Newman had seen several times in Valentin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncompany. On the bed lay Valentin, pale and still, with his eyes\r\nclosed\xe2\x80\x94a figure very shocking to Newman, who had seen it hitherto awake\r\nto its fingertips. M. de Grosjoyaux\xe2\x80\x99s colleague pointed to an open door\r\nbeyond, and whispered that the doctor was within, keeping guard. So\r\nlong as Valentin slept, or seemed to sleep, of course Newman could not\r\napproach him; so our hero withdrew for the present, committing himself\r\nto the care of the half-waked _bonne_. She took him to a room\r\nabove-stairs, and introduced him to a bed on which a magnified bolster,\r\nin yellow calico, figured as a counterpane. Newman lay down, and, in\r\nspite of his counterpane, slept for three or four hours. When he awoke,\r\nthe morning was advanced and the sun was filling his window, and he\r\nheard, outside of it, the clucking of hens. While he was dressing there\r\ncame to his door a messenger from M. de Grosjoyaux and his companion\r\nproposing that he should breakfast with them. Presently he went\r\ndownstairs to the little stone-paved dining-room, where the\r\nmaid-servant, who had taken off her night-cap, was serving the repast.\r\nM. de Grosjoyaux was there, surprisingly fresh for a gentleman who had\r\nbeen playing sick-nurse half the night, rubbing his hands and watching\r\nthe breakfast table attentively. Newman renewed acquaintance with him,\r\nand learned that Valentin was still sleeping; the surgeon, who had had\r\na fairly tranquil night, was at present sitting with him. Before M. de\r\nGrosjoyaux\xe2\x80\x99s associate reappeared, Newman learned that his name was M.\r\nLedoux, and that Bellegarde\xe2\x80\x99s acquaintance with him dated from the days\r\nwhen they served together in the Pontifical Zouaves. M. Ledoux was the\r\nnephew of a distinguished Ultramontane bishop. At last the bishop\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnephew came in with a toilet in which an ingenious attempt at harmony\r\nwith the peculiar situation was visible, and with a gravity tempered by\r\na decent deference to the best breakfast that the Croix Helv\xc3\xa9tique had\r\never set forth. Valentin\xe2\x80\x99s servant, who was allowed only in scanty\r\nmeasure the honor of watching with his master, had been lending a light\r\nParisian hand in the kitchen. The two Frenchmen did their best to prove\r\nthat if circumstances might overshadow, they could not really obscure,\r\nthe national talent for conversation, and M. Ledoux delivered a neat\r\nlittle eulogy on poor Bellegarde, whom he pronounced the most charming\r\nEnglishman he had ever known.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you call him an Englishman?\xe2\x80\x9d Newman asked.\r\n\r\nM. Ledoux smiled a moment and then made an epigram. _\xe2\x80\x9cC\xe2\x80\x99est plus qu\xe2\x80\x99un\r\nAnglais\xe2\x80\x94c\xe2\x80\x99est un Anglomane!\xe2\x80\x9d_ Newman said soberly that he had never\r\nnoticed it; and M. de Grosjoyaux remarked that it was really too soon\r\nto deliver a funeral oration upon poor Bellegarde. \xe2\x80\x9cEvidently,\xe2\x80\x9d said M.\r\nLedoux. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help observing this morning to Mr. Newman that\r\nwhen a man has taken such excellent measures for his salvation as our\r\ndear friend did last evening, it seems almost a pity he should put it\r\nin peril again by returning to the world.\xe2\x80\x9d M. Ledoux was a great\r\nCatholic, and Newman thought him a queer mixture. His countenance, by\r\ndaylight, had a sort of amiably saturnine cast; he had a very large\r\nthin nose, and looked like a Spanish picture. He appeared to think\r\ndueling a very perfect arrangement, provided, if one should get hit,\r\none could promptly see the priest. He seemed to take a great\r\nsatisfaction in Valentin\xe2\x80\x99s interview with the cur\xc3\xa9, and yet his\r\nconversation did not at all indicate a sanctimonious habit of mind. M.\r\nLedoux had evidently a high sense of the becoming, and was prepared to\r\nbe urbane and tasteful on all points. He was always furnished with a\r\nsmile (which pushed his moustache up under his nose) and an\r\nexplanation. _Savoir-vivre_\xe2\x80\x94knowing how to live\xe2\x80\x94was his specialty, in\r\nwhich he included knowing how to die; but, as Newman reflected, with a\r\ngood deal of dumb irritation, he seemed disposed to delegate to others\r\nthe application of his learning on this latter point. M. de Grosjoyaux\r\nwas of quite another complexion, and appeared to regard his friend\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntheological unction as the sign of an inaccessibly superior mind. He\r\nwas evidently doing his utmost, with a kind of jovial tenderness, to\r\nmake life agreeable to Valentin to the last, and help him as little as\r\npossible to miss the Boulevard des Italiens; but what chiefly occupied\r\nhis mind was the mystery of a bungling brewer\xe2\x80\x99s son making so neat a\r\nshot. He himself could snuff a candle, etc., and yet he confessed that\r\nhe could not have done better than this. He hastened to add that on the\r\npresent occasion he would have made a point of not doing so well. It\r\nwas not an occasion for that sort of murderous work, _que diable!_ He\r\nwould have picked out some quiet fleshy spot and just tapped it with a\r\nharmless ball. M. Stanislas Kapp had been deplorably heavy-handed; but\r\nreally, when the world had come to that pass that one granted a meeting\r\nto a brewer\xe2\x80\x99s son!... This was M. de Grosjoyaux\xe2\x80\x99s nearest approach to a\r\ngeneralization. He kept looking through the window, over the shoulder\r\nof M. Ledoux, at a slender tree which stood at the end of a lane,\r\nopposite to the inn, and seemed to be measuring its distance from his\r\nextended arm and secretly wishing that, since the subject had been\r\nintroduced, propriety did not forbid a little speculative\r\npistol-practice.\r\n\r\nNewman was in no humor to enjoy good company. He could neither eat nor\r\ntalk; his soul was sore with grief and anger, and the weight of his\r\ndouble sorrow was intolerable. He sat with his eyes fixed upon his\r\nplate, counting the minutes, wishing at one moment that Valentin would\r\nsee him and leave him free to go in quest of Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 and his\r\nlost happiness, and mentally calling himself a vile brute the next, for\r\nthe impatient egotism of the wish. He was very poor company, himself,\r\nand even his acute preoccupation and his general lack of the habit of\r\npondering the impression he produced did not prevent him from\r\nreflecting that his companions must be puzzled to see how poor\r\nBellegarde came to take such a fancy to this taciturn Yankee that he\r\nmust needs have him at his death-bed. After breakfast he strolled forth\r\nalone into the village and looked at the fountain, the geese, the open\r\nbarn doors, the brown, bent old women, showing their hugely darned\r\nstocking-heels at the ends of their slowly-clicking sabots, and the\r\nbeautiful view of snowy Alps and purple Jura at either end of the\r\nlittle street. The day was brilliant; early spring was in the air and\r\nin the sunshine, and the winter\xe2\x80\x99s damp was trickling out of the cottage\r\neaves. It was birth and brightness for all nature, even for chirping\r\nchickens and waddling goslings, and it was to be death and burial for\r\npoor, foolish, generous, delightful Bellegarde. Newman walked as far as\r\nthe village church, and went into the small graveyard beside it, where\r\nhe sat down and looked at the awkward tablets which were planted\r\naround. They were all sordid and hideous, and Newman could feel nothing\r\nbut the hardness and coldness of death. He got up and came back to the\r\ninn, where he found M. Ledoux having coffee and a cigarette at a little\r\ngreen table which he had caused to be carried into the small garden.\r\nNewman, learning that the doctor was still sitting with Valentin, asked\r\nM. Ledoux if he might not be allowed to relieve him; he had a great\r\ndesire to be useful to his poor friend. This was easily arranged; the\r\ndoctor was very glad to go to bed. He was a youthful and rather jaunty\r\npractitioner, but he had a clever face, and the ribbon of the Legion of\r\nHonor in his buttonhole; Newman listened attentively to the\r\ninstructions he gave him before retiring, and took mechanically from\r\nhis hand a small volume which the surgeon recommended as a help to\r\nwakefulness, and which turned out to be an old copy of \xe2\x80\x9cLes Liaisons\r\nDangereuses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nValentin was still lying with his eyes closed, and there was no visible\r\nchange in his condition. Newman sat down near him, and for a long time\r\nnarrowly watched him. Then his eyes wandered away with his thoughts\r\nupon his own situation, and rested upon the chain of the Alps,\r\ndisclosed by the drawing of the scant white cotton curtain of the\r\nwindow, through which the sunshine passed and lay in squares upon the\r\nred-tiled floor. He tried to interweave his reflections with hope, but\r\nhe only half succeeded. What had happened to him seemed to have, in its\r\nviolence and audacity, the force of a real calamity\xe2\x80\x94the strength and\r\ninsolence of Destiny herself. It was unnatural and monstrous, and he\r\nhad no arms against it. At last a sound struck upon the stillness, and\r\nhe heard Valentin\xe2\x80\x99s voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt can\xe2\x80\x99t be about _me_ you are pulling that long face!\xe2\x80\x9d He found, when\r\nhe turned, that Valentin was lying in the same position; but his eyes\r\nwere open, and he was even trying to smile. It was with a very slender\r\nstrength that he returned the pressure of Newman\xe2\x80\x99s hand. \xe2\x80\x9cI have been\r\nwatching you for a quarter of an hour,\xe2\x80\x9d Valentin went on; \xe2\x80\x9cyou have\r\nbeen looking as black as thunder. You are greatly disgusted with me, I\r\nsee. Well, of course! So am I!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I shall not scold you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cI feel too badly. And how\r\nare you getting on?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99m getting off! They have quite settled that; haven\xe2\x80\x99t they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s for you to settle; you can get well if you try,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman,\r\nwith resolute cheerfulness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear fellow, how can I try? Trying is violent exercise, and that\r\nsort of thing isn\xe2\x80\x99t in order for a man with a hole in his side as big\r\nas your hat, that begins to bleed if he moves a hair\xe2\x80\x99s-breadth. I knew\r\nyou would come,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued; \xe2\x80\x9cI knew I should wake up and find you\r\nhere; so I\xe2\x80\x99m not surprised. But last night I was very impatient. I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t see how I could keep still until you came. It was a matter of\r\nkeeping still, just like this; as still as a mummy in his case. You\r\ntalk about trying; I tried that! Well, here I am yet\xe2\x80\x94these twenty\r\nhours. It seems like twenty days.\xe2\x80\x9d Bellegarde talked slowly and feebly,\r\nbut distinctly enough. It was visible, however, that he was in extreme\r\npain, and at last he closed his eyes. Newman begged him to remain\r\nsilent and spare himself; the doctor had left urgent orders. \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nValentin, \xe2\x80\x9clet us eat and drink, for to-morrow\xe2\x80\x94to-morrow\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and he paused\r\nagain. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, not to-morrow, perhaps, but to-day. I can\xe2\x80\x99t eat and drink,\r\nbut I can talk. What\xe2\x80\x99s to be gained, at this pass, by\r\nrenun\xe2\x80\x94renunciation? I mustn\xe2\x80\x99t use such big words. I was always a\r\nchatterer; Lord, how I have talked in my day!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a reason for keeping quiet now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cWe know how well\r\nyou talk, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Valentin, without heeding him, went on in the same weak, dying\r\ndrawl. \xe2\x80\x9cI wanted to see you because you have seen my sister. Does she\r\nknow\xe2\x80\x94will she come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman was embarrassed. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, by this time she must know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t you tell her?\xe2\x80\x9d Valentin asked. And then, in a moment, \xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou bring me any message from her?\xe2\x80\x9d His eyes rested upon Newman\xe2\x80\x99s with\r\na certain soft keenness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t see her after I got your telegram,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cI wrote to\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd she sent you no answer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman was obliged to reply that Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 had left Paris. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\r\nwent yesterday to Fleuri\xc3\xa8res.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYesterday\xe2\x80\x94to Fleuri\xc3\xa8res? Why did she go to Fleuri\xc3\xa8res? What day is\r\nthis? What day was yesterday? Ah, then I shan\xe2\x80\x99t see her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Valentin\r\nsadly. \xe2\x80\x9cFleuri\xc3\xa8res is too far!\xe2\x80\x9d And then he closed his eyes again.\r\nNewman sat silent, summoning pious invention to his aid, but he was\r\nrelieved at finding that Valentin was apparently too weak to reason or\r\nto be curious. Bellegarde, however, presently went on. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd my\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x94and my brother\xe2\x80\x94will they come? Are they at Fleuri\xc3\xa8res?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey were in Paris, but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see them, either,\xe2\x80\x9d Newman answered.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf they received your telegram in time, they will have started this\r\nmorning. Otherwise they will be obliged to wait for the night-express,\r\nand they will arrive at the same hour as I did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey won\xe2\x80\x99t thank me\xe2\x80\x94they won\xe2\x80\x99t thank me,\xe2\x80\x9d Valentin murmured. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\r\nwill pass an atrocious night, and Urbain doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like the early morning\r\nair. I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember ever in my life to have seen him before\r\nnoon\xe2\x80\x94before breakfast. No one ever saw him. We don\xe2\x80\x99t know how he is\r\nthen. Perhaps he\xe2\x80\x99s different. Who knows? Posterity, perhaps, will know.\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s the time he works, in his _cabinet_, at the history of the\r\nPrincesses. But I had to send for them\xe2\x80\x94hadn\xe2\x80\x99t I? And then I want to see\r\nmy mother sit there where you sit, and say good-bye to her. Perhaps,\r\nafter all, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know her, and she will have some surprise for me.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t think you know her yet, yourself; perhaps she may surprise _you_.\r\nBut if I can\xe2\x80\x99t see Claire, I don\xe2\x80\x99t care for anything. I have been\r\nthinking of it\xe2\x80\x94and in my dreams, too. Why did she go to Fleuri\xc3\xa8res\r\nto-day? She never told me. What has happened? Ah, she ought to have\r\nguessed I was here\xe2\x80\x94this way. It is the first time in her life she ever\r\ndisappointed me. Poor Claire!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know we are not man and wife quite yet,\xe2\x80\x94your sister and I,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nNewman. \xe2\x80\x9cShe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t yet account to me for all her actions.\xe2\x80\x9d And, after\r\na fashion, he smiled.\r\n\r\nValentin looked at him a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you quarreled?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever, never, never!\xe2\x80\x9d Newman exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow happily you say that!\xe2\x80\x9d said Valentin. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are going to be\r\nhappy\xe2\x80\x94_va!_\xe2\x80\x9d In answer to this stroke of irony, none the less powerful\r\nfor being so unconscious, all poor Newman could do was to give a\r\nhelpless and transparent stare. Valentin continued to fix him with his\r\nown rather over-bright gaze, and presently he said, \xe2\x80\x9cBut something _is_\r\nthe matter with you. I watched you just now; you haven\xe2\x80\x99t a bridegroom\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nface.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, \xe2\x80\x9chow can I show _you_ a bridegroom\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nface? If you think I enjoy seeing you lie there and not being able to\r\nhelp you\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you are just the man to be cheerful; don\xe2\x80\x99t forfeit your rights!\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m a proof of your wisdom. When was a man ever gloomy when he could\r\nsay, \xe2\x80\x98I told you so?\xe2\x80\x99 You told me so, you know. You did what you could\r\nabout it. You said some very good things; I have thought them over.\r\nBut, my dear friend, I was right, all the same. This is the regular\r\nway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t do what I ought,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cI ought to have done\r\nsomething else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor instance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, something or other. I ought to have treated you as a small boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m a very small boy, now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Valentin. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m rather less than\r\nan infant. An infant is helpless, but it\xe2\x80\x99s generally voted promising.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m not promising, eh? Society can\xe2\x80\x99t lose a less valuable member.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman was strongly moved. He got up and turned his back upon his\r\nfriend and walked away to the window, where he stood looking out, but\r\nonly vaguely seeing. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I don\xe2\x80\x99t like the look of your back,\xe2\x80\x9d Valentin\r\ncontinued. \xe2\x80\x9cI have always been an observer of backs; yours is quite out\r\nof sorts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman returned to his bedside and begged him to be quiet. \xe2\x80\x9cBe quiet\r\nand get well,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what you must do. Get well and help\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told you you were in trouble! How can I help you?\xe2\x80\x9d Valentin asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know when you are better. You were always curious; there\r\nis something to get well for!\xe2\x80\x9d Newman answered, with resolute\r\nanimation.\r\n\r\nValentin closed his eyes and lay a long time without speaking. He\r\nseemed even to have fallen asleep. But at the end of half an hour he\r\nbegan to talk again. \xe2\x80\x9cI am rather sorry about that place in the bank.\r\nWho knows but that I might have become another Rothschild? But I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmeant for a banker; bankers are not so easy to kill. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think I\r\nhave been very easy to kill? It\xe2\x80\x99s not like a serious man. It\xe2\x80\x99s really\r\nvery mortifying. It\xe2\x80\x99s like telling your hostess you must go, when you\r\ncount upon her begging you to stay, and then finding she does no such\r\nthing. \xe2\x80\x98Really\xe2\x80\x94so soon? You\xe2\x80\x99ve only just come!\xe2\x80\x99 Life doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make me\r\nany such polite little speech.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman for some time said nothing, but at last he broke out. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nbad case\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s a bad case\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s the worst case I ever met. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want\r\nto say anything unpleasant, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t help it. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen men dying\r\nbefore\xe2\x80\x94and I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen men shot. But it always seemed more natural; they\r\nwere not so clever as you. Damnation\xe2\x80\x94damnation! You might have done\r\nsomething better than this. It\xe2\x80\x99s about the meanest winding-up of a\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s affairs that I can imagine!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nValentin feebly waved his hand to and fro. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t insist\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t insist!\r\nIt is mean\xe2\x80\x94decidedly mean. For you see at the bottom\xe2\x80\x94down at the\r\nbottom, in a little place as small as the end of a wine funnel\xe2\x80\x94I agree\r\nwith you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA few moments after this the doctor put his head through the\r\nhalf-opened door and, perceiving that Valentin was awake, came in and\r\nfelt his pulse. He shook his head and declared that he had talked too\r\nmuch\xe2\x80\x94ten times too much. \xe2\x80\x9cNonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d said Valentin; \xe2\x80\x9ca man sentenced to\r\ndeath can never talk too much. Have you never read an account of an\r\nexecution in a newspaper? Don\xe2\x80\x99t they always set a lot of people at the\r\nprisoner\xe2\x80\x94lawyers, reporters, priests\xe2\x80\x94to make him talk? But it\xe2\x80\x99s not Mr.\r\nNewman\xe2\x80\x99s fault; he sits there as mum as a death\xe2\x80\x99s-head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor observed that it was time his patient\xe2\x80\x99s wound should be\r\ndressed again; MM. de Grosjoyaux and Ledoux, who had already witnessed\r\nthis delicate operation, taking Newman\xe2\x80\x99s place as assistants. Newman\r\nwithdrew and learned from his fellow-watchers that they had received a\r\ntelegram from Urbain de Bellegarde to the effect that their message had\r\nbeen delivered in the Rue de l\xe2\x80\x99Universit\xc3\xa9 too late to allow him to take\r\nthe morning train, but that he would start with his mother in the\r\nevening. Newman wandered away into the village again, and walked about\r\nrestlessly for two or three hours. The day seemed terribly long. At\r\ndusk he came back and dined with the doctor and M. Ledoux. The dressing\r\nof Valentin\xe2\x80\x99s wound had been a very critical operation; the doctor\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t really see how he was to endure a repetition of it. He then\r\ndeclared that he must beg of Mr. Newman to deny himself for the present\r\nthe satisfaction of sitting with M. de Bellegarde; more than anyone\r\nelse, apparently, he had the flattering but inconvenient privilege of\r\nexciting him. M. Ledoux, at this, swallowed a glass of wine in silence;\r\nhe must have been wondering what the deuce Bellegarde found so exciting\r\nin the American.\r\n\r\nNewman, after dinner, went up to his room, where he sat for a long time\r\nstaring at his lighted candle, and thinking that Valentin was dying\r\ndownstairs. Late, when the candle had burnt low, there came a soft rap\r\nat his door. The doctor stood there with a candlestick and a shrug.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe must amuse himself still!\xe2\x80\x9d said Valentin\xe2\x80\x99s medical adviser. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\r\ninsists upon seeing you, and I am afraid you must come. I think at this\r\nrate, that he will hardly outlast the night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman went back to Valentin\xe2\x80\x99s room, which he found lighted by a taper\r\non the hearth. Valentin begged him to light a candle. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to see\r\nyour face,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey say you excite me,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, as Newman\r\ncomplied with this request, \xe2\x80\x9cand I confess I do feel excited. But it\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t you\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s my own thoughts. I have been thinking\xe2\x80\x94thinking. Sit down\r\nthere and let me look at you again.\xe2\x80\x9d Newman seated himself, folded his\r\narms, and bent a heavy gaze upon his friend. He seemed to be playing a\r\npart, mechanically, in a lugubrious comedy. Valentin looked at him for\r\nsome time. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, this morning I was right; you have something on your\r\nmind heavier than Valentin de Bellegarde. Come, I\xe2\x80\x99m a dying man and\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s indecent to deceive me. Something happened after I left Paris. It\r\nwas not for nothing that my sister started off at this season of the\r\nyear for Fleuri\xc3\xa8res. Why was it? It sticks in my crop. I have been\r\nthinking it over, and if you don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me I shall guess.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had better not tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cIt won\xe2\x80\x99t do you any good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you think it will do me any good not to tell me, you are very much\r\nmistaken. There is trouble about your marriage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is trouble about my marriage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood!\xe2\x80\x9d And Valentin was silent again. \xe2\x80\x9cThey have stopped it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey have stopped it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. Now that he had spoken out, he\r\nfound a satisfaction in it which deepened as he went on. \xe2\x80\x9cYour mother\r\nand brother have broken faith. They have decided that it can\xe2\x80\x99t take\r\nplace. They have decided that I am not good enough, after all. They\r\nhave taken back their word. Since you insist, there it is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nValentin gave a sort of groan, lifted his hands a moment, and then let\r\nthem drop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry not to have anything better to tell you about them,\xe2\x80\x9d Newman\r\npursued. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it\xe2\x80\x99s not my fault. I was, indeed, very unhappy when your\r\ntelegram reached me; I was quite upside down. You may imagine whether I\r\nfeel any better now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nValentin moaned gaspingly, as if his wound were throbbing. \xe2\x80\x9cBroken\r\nfaith, broken faith!\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd my sister\xe2\x80\x94my sister?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour sister is very unhappy; she has consented to give me up. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow why. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what they have done to her; it must be something\r\npretty bad. In justice to her you ought to know it. They have made her\r\nsuffer. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen her alone, but only before them! We had an\r\ninterview yesterday morning. They came out flat, in so many words. They\r\ntold me to go about my business. It seems to me a very bad case. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nangry, I\xe2\x80\x99m sore, I\xe2\x80\x99m sick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nValentin lay there staring, with his eyes more brilliantly lighted, his\r\nlips soundlessly parted, and a flush of color in his pale face. Newman\r\nhad never before uttered so many words in the plaintive key, but now,\r\nin speaking to Valentin in the poor fellow\xe2\x80\x99s extremity, he had a\r\nfeeling that he was making his complaint somewhere within the presence\r\nof the power that men pray to in trouble; he felt his outgush of\r\nresentment as a sort of spiritual privilege.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Claire,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94said Bellegarde,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cClaire? She has given you up?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t really believe it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it, don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it. She is gaining time; excuse\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI pity her!\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor Claire!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Valentin. \xe2\x80\x9cBut they\xe2\x80\x94but they\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and he paused\r\nagain. \xe2\x80\x9cYou saw them; they dismissed you, face to face?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFace to face. They were very explicit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did they say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey said they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stand a commercial person.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nValentin put out his hand and laid it upon Newman\xe2\x80\x99s arm. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd about\r\ntheir promise\xe2\x80\x94their engagement with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey made a distinction. They said it was to hold good only until\r\nMadame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 accepted me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nValentin lay staring a while, and his flush died away. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t tell me\r\nany more,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m ashamed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou? You are the soul of honor,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman simply.\r\n\r\nValentin groaned and turned away his head. For some time nothing more\r\nwas said. Then Valentin turned back again and found a certain force to\r\npress Newman\xe2\x80\x99s arm. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very bad\xe2\x80\x94very bad. When my people\xe2\x80\x94when my\r\nrace\xe2\x80\x94come to that, it is time for me to withdraw. I believe in my\r\nsister; she will explain. Excuse her. If she can\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94if she can\xe2\x80\x99t,\r\nforgive her. She has suffered. But for the others it is very bad\xe2\x80\x94very\r\nbad. You take it very hard? No, it\xe2\x80\x99s a shame to make you say so.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nclosed his eyes and again there was a silence. Newman felt almost awed;\r\nhe had evoked a more solemn spirit than he expected. Presently Valentin\r\nlooked at him again, removing his hand from his arm. \xe2\x80\x9cI apologize,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you understand? Here on my death-bed. I apologize for my\r\nfamily. For my mother. For my brother. For the ancient house of\r\nBellegarde. _Voil\xc3\xa0!_\xe2\x80\x9d he added softly.\r\n\r\nNewman for an answer took his hand and pressed it with a world of\r\nkindness. Valentin remained quiet, and at the end of half an hour the\r\ndoctor softly came in. Behind him, through the half-open door, Newman\r\nsaw the two questioning faces of MM. de Grosjoyaux and Ledoux. The\r\ndoctor laid his hand on Valentin\xe2\x80\x99s wrist and sat looking at him. He\r\ngave no sign and the two gentlemen came in, M. Ledoux having first\r\nbeckoned to someone outside. This was M. le Cur\xc3\xa9, who carried in his\r\nhand an object unknown to Newman, and covered with a white napkin. M.\r\nle Cur\xc3\xa9 was short, round, and red: he advanced, pulling off his little\r\nblack cap to Newman, and deposited his burden on the table; and then he\r\nsat down in the best armchair, with his hands folded across his person.\r\nThe other gentlemen had exchanged glances which expressed unanimity as\r\nto the timeliness of their presence. But for a long time Valentin\r\nneither spoke nor moved. It was Newman\xe2\x80\x99s belief, afterwards, that M. le\r\nCur\xc3\xa9 went to sleep. At last abruptly, Valentin pronounced Newman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nname. His friend went to him, and he said in French, \xe2\x80\x9cYou are not\r\nalone. I want to speak to you alone.\xe2\x80\x9d Newman looked at the doctor, and\r\nthe doctor looked at the cur\xc3\xa9, who looked back at him; and then the\r\ndoctor and the cur\xc3\xa9, together, gave a shrug. \xe2\x80\x9cAlone\xe2\x80\x94for five minutes,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nValentin repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cPlease leave us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe cur\xc3\xa9 took up his burden again and led the way out, followed by his\r\ncompanions. Newman closed the door behind them and came back to\r\nValentin\xe2\x80\x99s bedside. Bellegarde had watched all this intently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very bad, it\xe2\x80\x99s very bad,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, after Newman had seated\r\nhimself close to him. \xe2\x80\x9cThe more I think of it the worse it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t think of it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\nBut Valentin went on, without heeding him. \xe2\x80\x9cEven if they should come\r\nround again, the shame\xe2\x80\x94the baseness\xe2\x80\x94is there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, they won\xe2\x80\x99t come round!\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you can make them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMake them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can tell you something\xe2\x80\x94a great secret\xe2\x80\x94an immense secret. You can use\r\nit against them\xe2\x80\x94frighten them, force them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA secret!\xe2\x80\x9d Newman repeated. The idea of letting Valentin, on his\r\ndeath-bed, confide him an \xe2\x80\x9cimmense secret\xe2\x80\x9d shocked him, for the moment,\r\nand made him draw back. It seemed an illicit way of arriving at\r\ninformation, and even had a vague analogy with listening at a keyhole.\r\nThen, suddenly, the thought of \xe2\x80\x9cforcing\xe2\x80\x9d Madame de Bellegarde and her\r\nson became attractive, and Newman bent his head closer to Valentin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlips. For some time, however, the dying man said nothing more. He only\r\nlay and looked at his friend with his kindled, expanded, troubled eye,\r\nand Newman began to believe that he had spoken in delirium. But at last\r\nhe said,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was something done\xe2\x80\x94something done at Fleuri\xc3\xa8res. It was foul\r\nplay. My father\xe2\x80\x94something happened to him. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know; I have been\r\nashamed\xe2\x80\x94afraid to know. But I know there is something. My mother\r\nknows\xe2\x80\x94Urbain knows.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething happened to your father?\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, urgently.\r\n\r\nValentin looked at him, still more wide-eyed. \xe2\x80\x9cHe didn\xe2\x80\x99t get well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet well of what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the immense effort which Valentin had made, first to decide to\r\nutter these words and then to bring them out, appeared to have taken\r\nhis last strength. He lapsed again into silence, and Newman sat\r\nwatching him. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you understand?\xe2\x80\x9d he began again, presently. \xe2\x80\x9cAt\r\nFleuri\xc3\xa8res. You can find out. Mrs. Bread knows. Tell her I begged you\r\nto ask her. Then tell them that, and see. It may help you. If not, tell\r\neveryone. It will\xe2\x80\x94it will\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94here Valentin\xe2\x80\x99s voice sank to the feeblest\r\nmurmur\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cit will avenge you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe words died away in a long, soft groan. Newman stood up, deeply\r\nimpressed, not knowing what to say; his heart was beating violently.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last. \xe2\x80\x9cI am much obliged.\xe2\x80\x9d But Valentin seemed\r\nnot to hear him, he remained silent, and his silence continued. At last\r\nNewman went and opened the door. M. le Cur\xc3\xa9 re-entered, bearing his\r\nsacred vessel and followed by the three gentlemen and by Valentin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nservant. It was almost processional.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\n\r\nValentin de Bellegarde died tranquilly, just as the cold faint March\r\ndawn began to illumine the faces of the little knot of friends gathered\r\nabout his bedside. An hour afterwards Newman left the inn and drove to\r\nGeneva; he was naturally unwilling to be present at the arrival of\r\nMadame de Bellegarde and her first-born. At Geneva, for the moment, he\r\nremained. He was like a man who has had a fall and wants to sit still\r\nand count his bruises. He instantly wrote to Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9, relating\r\nto her the circumstances of her brother\xe2\x80\x99s death\xe2\x80\x94with certain\r\nexceptions\xe2\x80\x94and asking her what was the earliest moment at which he\r\nmight hope that she would consent to see him. M. Ledoux had told him\r\nthat he had reason to know that Valentin\xe2\x80\x99s will\xe2\x80\x94Bellegarde had a great\r\ndeal of elegant personal property to dispose of\xe2\x80\x94contained a request\r\nthat he should be buried near his father in the churchyard of\r\nFleuri\xc3\xa8res, and Newman intended that the state of his own relations\r\nwith the family should not deprive him of the satisfaction of helping\r\nto pay the last earthly honors to the best fellow in the world. He\r\nreflected that Valentin\xe2\x80\x99s friendship was older than Urbain\xe2\x80\x99s enmity,\r\nand that at a funeral it was easy to escape notice. Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nanswer to his letter enabled him to time his arrival at Fleuri\xc3\xa8res.\r\nThis answer was very brief; it ran as follows:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thank you for your letter, and for your being with Valentin. It is a\r\nmost inexpressible sorrow to me that I was not. To see you will be\r\nnothing but a distress to me; there is no need, therefore, to wait for\r\nwhat you call brighter days. It is all one now, and I shall have no\r\nbrighter days. Come when you please; only notify me first. My brother\r\nis to be buried here on Friday, and my family is to remain here. C. de\r\nC.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs soon as he received this letter Newman went straight to Paris and to\r\nPoitiers. The journey took him far southward, through green Touraine\r\nand across the far-shining Loire, into a country where the early spring\r\ndeepened about him as he went. But he had never made a journey during\r\nwhich he heeded less what he would have called the lay of the land. He\r\nobtained lodging at the inn at Poitiers, and the next morning drove in\r\na couple of hours to the village of Fleuri\xc3\xa8res. But here, preoccupied\r\nthough he was, he could not fail to notice the picturesqueness of the\r\nplace. It was what the French call a _petit bourg_; it lay at the base\r\nof a sort of huge mound on the summit of which stood the crumbling\r\nruins of a feudal castle, much of whose sturdy material, as well as\r\nthat of the wall which dropped along the hill to enclose the clustered\r\nhouses defensively, had been absorbed into the very substance of the\r\nvillage. The church was simply the former chapel of the castle,\r\nfronting upon its grass-grown court, which, however, was of generous\r\nenough width to have given up its quaintest corner to a little\r\ngraveyard. Here the very headstones themselves seemed to sleep, as they\r\nslanted into the grass; the patient elbow of the rampart held them\r\ntogether on one side, and in front, far beneath their mossy lids, the\r\ngreen plains and blue distances stretched away. The way to church, up\r\nthe hill, was impracticable to vehicles. It was lined with peasants,\r\ntwo or three rows deep, who stood watching old Madame de Bellegarde\r\nslowly ascend it, on the arm of her elder son, behind the pall-bearers\r\nof the other. Newman chose to lurk among the common mourners who\r\nmurmured \xe2\x80\x9cMadame la Comtesse\xe2\x80\x9d as a tall figure veiled in black passed\r\nbefore them. He stood in the dusky little church while the service was\r\ngoing forward, but at the dismal tomb-side he turned away and walked\r\ndown the hill. He went back to Poitiers, and spent two days in which\r\npatience and impatience were singularly commingled. On the third day he\r\nsent Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 a note, saying that he would call upon her in the\r\nafternoon, and in accordance with this he again took his way to\r\nFleuri\xc3\xa8res. He left his vehicle at the tavern in the village street,\r\nand obeyed the simple instructions which were given him for finding the\r\nch\xc3\xa2teau.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is just beyond there,\xe2\x80\x9d said the landlord, and pointed to the\r\ntree-tops of the park, above the opposite houses. Newman followed the\r\nfirst cross-road to the right\xe2\x80\x94it was bordered with mouldy cottages\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nin a few moments saw before him the peaked roofs of the towers.\r\nAdvancing farther, he found himself before a vast iron gate, rusty and\r\nclosed; here he paused a moment, looking through the bars. The ch\xc3\xa2teau\r\nwas near the road; this was at once its merit and its defect; but its\r\naspect was extremely impressive. Newman learned afterwards, from a\r\nguide-book of the province, that it dated from the time of Henry IV. It\r\npresented to the wide, paved area which preceded it and which was edged\r\nwith shabby farm-buildings an immense fa\xc3\xa7ade of dark time-stained\r\nbrick, flanked by two low wings, each of which terminated in a little\r\nDutch-looking pavilion capped with a fantastic roof. Two towers rose\r\nbehind, and behind the towers was a mass of elms and beeches, now just\r\nfaintly green.\r\n\r\nBut the great feature was a wide, green river which washed the\r\nfoundations of the ch\xc3\xa2teau. The building rose from an island in the\r\ncircling stream, so that this formed a perfect moat spanned by a\r\ntwo-arched bridge without a parapet. The dull brick walls, which here\r\nand there made a grand, straight sweep; the ugly little cupolas of the\r\nwings, the deep-set windows, the long, steep pinnacles of mossy slate,\r\nall mirrored themselves in the tranquil river. Newman rang at the gate,\r\nand was almost frightened at the tone with which a big rusty bell above\r\nhis head replied to him. An old woman came out from the gate-house and\r\nopened the creaking portal just wide enough for him to pass, and he\r\nwent in, across the dry, bare court and the little cracked white slabs\r\nof the causeway on the moat. At the door of the ch\xc3\xa2teau he waited for\r\nsome moments, and this gave him a chance to observe that Fleuri\xc3\xa8res was\r\nnot \xe2\x80\x9ckept up,\xe2\x80\x9d and to reflect that it was a melancholy place of\r\nresidence. \xe2\x80\x9cIt looks,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman to himself\xe2\x80\x94and I give the comparison\r\nfor what it is worth\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9clike a Chinese penitentiary.\xe2\x80\x9d At last the door\r\nwas opened by a servant whom he remembered to have seen in the Rue de\r\nl\xe2\x80\x99Universit\xc3\xa9. The man\xe2\x80\x99s dull face brightened as he perceived our hero,\r\nfor Newman, for indefinable reasons, enjoyed the confidence of the\r\nliveried gentry. The footman led the way across a great central\r\nvestibule, with a pyramid of plants in tubs in the middle of glass\r\ndoors all around, to what appeared to be the principal drawing-room of\r\nthe ch\xc3\xa2teau. Newman crossed the threshold of a room of superb\r\nproportions, which made him feel at first like a tourist with a\r\nguide-book and a cicerone awaiting a fee. But when his guide had left\r\nhim alone, with the observation that he would call Madame la Comtesse,\r\nNewman perceived that the salon contained little that was remarkable\r\nsave a dark ceiling with curiously carved rafters, some curtains of\r\nelaborate, antiquated tapestry, and a dark oaken floor, polished like a\r\nmirror. He waited some minutes, walking up and down; but at length, as\r\nhe turned at the end of the room, he saw that Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 had come\r\nin by a distant door. She wore a black dress, and she stood looking at\r\nhim. As the length of the immense room lay between them he had time to\r\nlook at her before they met in the middle of it.\r\n\r\nHe was dismayed at the change in her appearance. Pale, heavy-browed,\r\nalmost haggard with a sort of monastic rigidity in her dress, she had\r\nlittle but her pure features in common with the woman whose radiant\r\ngood grace he had hitherto admired. She let her eyes rest on his own,\r\nand she let him take her hand; but her eyes looked like two rainy\r\nautumn moons, and her touch was portentously lifeless.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was at your brother\xe2\x80\x99s funeral,\xe2\x80\x9d Newman said. \xe2\x80\x9cThen I waited three\r\ndays. But I could wait no longer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing can be lost or gained by waiting,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\nit was very considerate of you to wait, wronged as you have been.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad you think I have been wronged,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, with that oddly\r\nhumorous accent with which he often uttered words of the gravest\r\nmeaning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo I need to say so?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I have wronged,\r\nseriously, many persons; certainly not consciously. To you, to whom I\r\nhave done this hard and cruel thing, the only reparation I can make is\r\nto say, \xe2\x80\x98I know it, I feel it!\xe2\x80\x99 The reparation is pitifully small!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s a great step forward!\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, with a gracious smile of\r\nencouragement. He pushed a chair towards her and held it, looking at\r\nher urgently. She sat down, mechanically, and he seated himself near\r\nher; but in a moment he got up, restlessly, and stood before her. She\r\nremained seated, like a troubled creature who had passed through the\r\nstage of restlessness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say nothing is to be gained by my seeing you,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, \xe2\x80\x9cand yet\r\nI am very glad you came. Now I can tell you what I feel. It is a\r\nselfish pleasure, but it is one of the last I shall have.\xe2\x80\x9d And she\r\npaused, with her great misty eyes fixed upon him. \xe2\x80\x9cI know how I have\r\ndeceived and injured you; I know how cruel and cowardly I have been. I\r\nsee it as vividly as you do\xe2\x80\x94I feel it to the ends of my fingers.\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nshe unclasped her hands, which were locked together in her lap, lifted\r\nthem, and dropped them at her side. \xe2\x80\x9cAnything that you may have said of\r\nme in your angriest passion is nothing to what I have said to myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn my angriest passion,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, \xe2\x80\x9cI have said nothing hard of\r\nyou. The very worst thing I have said of you yet is that you are the\r\nloveliest of women.\xe2\x80\x9d And he seated himself before her again abruptly.\r\n\r\nShe flushed a little, but even her flush was pale. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is because you\r\nthink I will come back. But I will not come back. It is in that hope\r\nyou have come here, I know; I am very sorry for you. I would do almost\r\nanything for you. To say that, after what I have done, seems simply\r\nimpudent; but what can I say that will not seem impudent? To wrong you\r\nand apologize\xe2\x80\x94that is easy enough. I should not have wronged you.\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\nstopped a moment, looking at him, and motioned him to let her go on. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nought never to have listened to you at first; that was the wrong. No\r\ngood could come of it. I felt it, and yet I listened; that was your\r\nfault. I liked you too much; I believed in you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd don\xe2\x80\x99t you believe in me now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore than ever. But now it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. I have given you up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman gave a powerful thump with his clenched fist upon his knee.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, why, why?\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cGive me a reason\xe2\x80\x94a decent reason. You are\r\nnot a child\xe2\x80\x94you are not a minor, nor an idiot. You are not obliged to\r\ndrop me because your mother told you to. Such a reason isn\xe2\x80\x99t worthy of\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know that; it\xe2\x80\x99s not worthy of me. But it\xe2\x80\x99s the only one I have to\r\ngive. After all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9, throwing out her hands, \xe2\x80\x9cthink\r\nme an idiot and forget me! That will be the simplest way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman got up and walked away with a crushing sense that his cause was\r\nlost, and yet with an equal inability to give up fighting. He went to\r\none of the great windows, and looked out at the stiffly embanked river\r\nand the formal gardens which lay beyond it. When he turned round,\r\nMadame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 had risen; she stood there silent and passive. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nare not frank,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman; \xe2\x80\x9cyou are not honest. Instead of saying\r\nthat you are imbecile, you should say that other people are wicked.\r\nYour mother and your brother have been false and cruel; they have been\r\nso to me, and I am sure they have been so to you. Why do you try to\r\nshield them? Why do you sacrifice me to them? I\xe2\x80\x99m not false; I\xe2\x80\x99m not\r\ncruel. You don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you give up; I can tell you that\xe2\x80\x94you don\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\nThey bully you and plot about you; and I\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94And he paused, holding out\r\nhis hands. She turned away and began to leave him. \xe2\x80\x9cYou told me the\r\nother day that you were afraid of your mother,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, following her.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 shook her head. \xe2\x80\x9cI remember; I was sorry afterwards.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were sorry when she came down and put on the thumbscrews. In God\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nname what _is_ it she does to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing. Nothing that you can understand. And now that I have given\r\nyou up, I must not complain of her to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s no reasoning!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cComplain of her, on the contrary.\r\nTell me all about it, frankly and trustfully, as you ought, and we will\r\ntalk it over so satisfactorily that you won\xe2\x80\x99t give me up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 looked down some moments, fixedly; and then, raising\r\nher eyes, she said, \xe2\x80\x9cOne good at least has come of this: I have made\r\nyou judge me more fairly. You thought of me in a way that did me great\r\nhonor; I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why you had taken it into your head. But it left me\r\nno loophole for escape\xe2\x80\x94no chance to be the common, weak creature I am.\r\nIt was not my fault; I warned you from the first. But I ought to have\r\nwarned you more. I ought to have convinced you that I was doomed to\r\ndisappoint you. But I _was_, in a way, too proud. You see what my\r\nsuperiority amounts to, I hope!\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, raising her voice with a\r\ntremor which even then and there Newman thought beautiful. \xe2\x80\x9cI am too\r\nproud to be honest, I am not too proud to be faithless. I am timid and\r\ncold and selfish. I am afraid of being uncomfortable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you call marrying me uncomfortable!\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman staring.\r\n\r\nMadame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 blushed a little and seemed to say that if begging his\r\npardon in words was impudent, she might at least thus mutely express\r\nher perfect comprehension of his finding her conduct odious. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not\r\nmarrying you; it is doing all that would go with it. It\xe2\x80\x99s the rupture,\r\nthe defiance, the insisting upon being happy in my own way. What right\r\nhave I to be happy when\xe2\x80\x94when\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94And she paused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen what?\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen others have been most unhappy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat others?\xe2\x80\x9d Newman asked. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you to do with any others but\r\nme? Besides you said just now that you wanted happiness, and that you\r\nshould find it by obeying your mother. You contradict yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I contradict myself; that shows you that I am not even\r\nintelligent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are laughing at me!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are mocking me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at him intently, and an observer might have said that she\r\nwas asking herself whether she might not most quickly end their common\r\npain by confessing that she was mocking him. \xe2\x80\x9cNo; I am not,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\npresently said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGranting that you are not intelligent,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you are\r\nweak, that you are common, that you are nothing that I have believed\r\nyou were\xe2\x80\x94what I ask of you is not heroic effort, it is a very common\r\neffort. There is a great deal on my side to make it easy. The simple\r\ntruth is that you don\xe2\x80\x99t care enough about me to make it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am cold,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9, \xe2\x80\x9cI am as cold as that flowing\r\nriver.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman gave a great rap on the floor with his stick, and a long, grim\r\nlaugh. \xe2\x80\x9cGood, good!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cYou go altogether too far\xe2\x80\x94you overshoot\r\nthe mark. There isn\xe2\x80\x99t a woman in the world as bad as you would make\r\nyourself out. I see your game; it\xe2\x80\x99s what I said. You are blackening\r\nyourself to whiten others. You don\xe2\x80\x99t want to give me up, at all; you\r\nlike me\xe2\x80\x94you like me. I know you do; you have shown it, and I have felt\r\nit. After that, you may be as cold as you please! They have bullied\r\nyou, I say; they have tortured you. It\xe2\x80\x99s an outrage, and I insist upon\r\nsaving you from the extravagance of your own generosity. Would you chop\r\noff your hand if your mother requested it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 looked a little frightened. \xe2\x80\x9cI spoke of my mother too\r\nblindly, the other day. I am my own mistress, by law and by her\r\napproval. She can do nothing to me; she has done nothing. She has never\r\nalluded to those hard words I used about her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has made you feel them, I\xe2\x80\x99ll promise you!\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s my conscience that makes me feel them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour conscience seems to me to be rather mixed!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Newman,\r\npassionately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt has been in great trouble, but now it is very clear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame\r\nde Cintr\xc3\xa9. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t give you up for any worldly advantage or for any\r\nworldly happiness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you don\xe2\x80\x99t give me up for Lord Deepmere, I know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t pretend, even to provoke you, that I think that. But that\xe2\x80\x99s what\r\nyour mother and your brother wanted, and your mother, at that\r\nvillainous ball of hers\xe2\x80\x94I liked it at the time, but the very thought of\r\nit now makes me rabid\xe2\x80\x94tried to push him on to make up to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho told you this?\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 softly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot Valentin. I observed it. I guessed it. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know at the time\r\nthat I was observing it, but it stuck in my memory. And afterwards, you\r\nrecollect, I saw Lord Deepmere with you in the conservatory. You said\r\nthen that you would tell me at another time what he had said to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was before\xe2\x80\x94before _this_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman; \xe2\x80\x9cand, besides, I think I know. He\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nan honest little Englishman. He came and told you what your mother was\r\nup to\xe2\x80\x94that she wanted him to supplant me; not being a commercial\r\nperson. If he would make you an offer she would undertake to bring you\r\nover and give me the slip. Lord Deepmere isn\xe2\x80\x99t very intellectual, so\r\nshe had to spell it out to him. He said he admired you \xe2\x80\x98no end,\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\nthat he wanted you to know it; but he didn\xe2\x80\x99t like being mixed up with\r\nthat sort of underhand work, and he came to you and told tales. That\r\nwas about the amount of it, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it? And then you said you were\r\nperfectly happy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see why we should talk of Lord Deepmere,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de\r\nCintr\xc3\xa9. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was not for that you came here. And about my mother, it\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter what you suspect and what you know. When once my mind\r\nhas been made up, as it is now, I should not discuss these things.\r\nDiscussing anything, now, is very idle. We must try and live each as we\r\ncan. I believe you will be happy again; even, sometimes, when you think\r\nof me. When you do so, think this\xe2\x80\x94that it was not easy, and that I did\r\nthe best I could. I have things to reckon with that you don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I\r\nmean I have feelings. I must do as they force me\xe2\x80\x94I must, I must. They\r\nwould haunt me otherwise,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, with vehemence; \xe2\x80\x9cthey would kill\r\nme!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know what your feelings are: they are superstitions! They are the\r\nfeeling that, after all, though I _am_ a good fellow, I have been in\r\nbusiness; the feeling that your mother\xe2\x80\x99s looks are law and your\r\nbrother\xe2\x80\x99s words are gospel; that you all hang together, and that it\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\npart of the everlasting proprieties that they should have a hand in\r\neverything you do. It makes my blood boil. That _is_ cold; you are\r\nright. And what I feel here,\xe2\x80\x9d and Newman struck his heart and became\r\nmore poetical than he knew, \xe2\x80\x9cis a glowing fire!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA spectator less preoccupied than Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s distracted wooer\r\nwould have felt sure from the first that her appealing calm of manner\r\nwas the result of violent effort, in spite of which the tide of\r\nagitation was rapidly rising. On these last words of Newman\xe2\x80\x99s it\r\noverflowed, though at first she spoke low, for fear of her voice\r\nbetraying her. \xe2\x80\x9cNo. I was not right\xe2\x80\x94I am not cold! I believe that if I\r\nam doing what seems so bad, it is not mere weakness and falseness. Mr.\r\nNewman, it\xe2\x80\x99s like a religion. I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t! It\xe2\x80\x99s cruel of\r\nyou to insist. I don\xe2\x80\x99t see why I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ask you to believe me\xe2\x80\x94and\r\npity me. It\xe2\x80\x99s like a religion. There\xe2\x80\x99s a curse upon the house; I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow what\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t ask me. We must all bear it. I have\r\nbeen too selfish; I wanted to escape from it. You offered me a great\r\nchance\xe2\x80\x94besides my liking you. It seemed good to change completely, to\r\nbreak, to go away. And then I admired you. But I can\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94it has overtaken\r\nand come back to me.\xe2\x80\x9d Her self-control had now completely abandoned\r\nher, and her words were broken with long sobs. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy do such dreadful\r\nthings happen to us\xe2\x80\x94why is my brother Valentin killed, like a beast in\r\nthe midst of his youth and his gaiety and his brightness and all that\r\nwe loved him for? Why are there things I can\xe2\x80\x99t ask about\xe2\x80\x94that I am\r\nafraid to know? Why are there places I can\xe2\x80\x99t look at, sounds I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhear? Why is it given to me to choose, to decide, in a case so hard and\r\nso terrible as this? I am not meant for that\xe2\x80\x94I am not made for boldness\r\nand defiance. I was made to be happy in a quiet, natural way.\xe2\x80\x9d At this\r\nNewman gave a most expressive groan, but Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 went on. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwas made to do gladly and gratefully what is expected of me. My mother\r\nhas always been very good to me; that\xe2\x80\x99s all I can say. I must not judge\r\nher; I must not criticize her. If I did, it would come back to me. I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t change!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, bitterly; \xe2\x80\x9c_I_ must change\xe2\x80\x94if I break in two in the\r\neffort!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are different. You are a man; you will get over it. You have all\r\nkinds of consolation. You were born\xe2\x80\x94you were trained, to changes.\r\nBesides\xe2\x80\x94besides, I shall always think of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care for that!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are cruel\xe2\x80\x94you are terribly\r\ncruel. God forgive you! You may have the best reasons and the finest\r\nfeelings in the world; that makes no difference. You are a mystery to\r\nme; I don\xe2\x80\x99t see how such hardness can go with such loveliness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 fixed him a moment with her swimming eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nbelieve I am hard, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman answered her look, and then broke out, \xe2\x80\x9cYou are a perfect,\r\nfaultless creature! Stay by me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I am hard,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on. \xe2\x80\x9cWhenever we give pain we are hard.\r\nAnd we _must_ give pain; that\xe2\x80\x99s the world,\xe2\x80\x94the hateful, miserable\r\nworld! Ah!\xe2\x80\x9d and she gave a long, deep sigh, \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t even say I am glad\r\nto have known you\xe2\x80\x94though I am. That too is to wrong you. I can say\r\nnothing that is not cruel. Therefore let us part, without more of this.\r\nGood-bye!\xe2\x80\x9d And she put out her hand.\r\n\r\nNewman stood and looked at it without taking it, and raised his eyes to\r\nher face. He felt, himself, like shedding tears of rage. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you\r\ngoing to do?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you going?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere I shall give no more pain and suspect no more evil. I am going\r\nout of the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOut of the world?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going into a convent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInto a convent!\xe2\x80\x9d Newman repeated the words with the deepest dismay; it\r\nwas as if she had said she was going into an hospital. \xe2\x80\x9cInto a\r\nconvent\xe2\x80\x94_you!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told you that it was not for my worldly advantage or pleasure I was\r\nleaving you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut still Newman hardly understood. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are going to be a nun,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nwent on, \xe2\x80\x9cin a cell\xe2\x80\x94for life\xe2\x80\x94with a gown and white veil?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA nun\xe2\x80\x94a Carmelite nun,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9. \xe2\x80\x9cFor life, with God\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nleave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe idea struck Newman as too dark and horrible for belief, and made\r\nhim feel as he would have done if she had told him that she was going\r\nto mutilate her beautiful face, or drink some potion that would make\r\nher mad. He clasped his hands and began to tremble, visibly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadame de Cintr\xc3\xa9, don\xe2\x80\x99t, don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI beseech you! On my knees,\r\nif you like, I\xe2\x80\x99ll beseech you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe laid her hand upon his arm, with a tender, pitying, almost\r\nreassuring gesture. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t understand,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have wrong\r\nideas. It\xe2\x80\x99s nothing horrible. It is only peace and safety. It is to be\r\nout of the world, where such troubles as this come to the innocent, to\r\nthe best. And for life\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s the blessing of it! They can\xe2\x80\x99t begin\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman dropped into a chair and sat looking at her with a long,\r\ninarticulate murmur. That this superb woman, in whom he had seen all\r\nhuman grace and household force, should turn from him and all the\r\nbrightness that he offered her\xe2\x80\x94him and his future and his fortune and\r\nhis fidelity\xe2\x80\x94to muffle herself in ascetic rags and entomb herself in a\r\ncell was a confounding combination of the inexorable and the grotesque.\r\nAs the image deepened before him the grotesque seemed to expand and\r\noverspread it; it was a reduction to the absurd of the trial to which\r\nhe was subjected. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x94you a nun!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed; \xe2\x80\x9cyou with your beauty\r\ndefaced\xe2\x80\x94you behind locks and bars! Never, never, if I can prevent it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAnd he sprang to his feet with a violent laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t prevent it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9, \xe2\x80\x9cand it ought\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nlittle\xe2\x80\x94to satisfy you. Do you suppose I will go on living in the world,\r\nstill beside you, and yet not with you? It is all arranged. Good-bye,\r\ngood-bye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis time he took her hand, took it in both his own. \xe2\x80\x9cForever?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid. Her lips made an inaudible movement and his own uttered a deep\r\nimprecation. She closed her eyes, as if with the pain of hearing it;\r\nthen he drew her towards him and clasped her to his breast. He kissed\r\nher white face; for an instant she resisted and for a moment she\r\nsubmitted; then, with force, she disengaged herself and hurried away\r\nover the long shining floor. The next moment the door closed behind\r\nher.\r\n\r\nNewman made his way out as he could.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a pretty public walk at Poitiers, laid out upon the crest of\r\nthe high hill around which the little city clusters, planted with thick\r\ntrees and looking down upon the fertile fields in which the old English\r\nprinces fought for their right and held it. Newman paced up and down\r\nthis quiet promenade for the greater part of the next day and let his\r\neyes wander over the historic prospect; but he would have been sadly at\r\na loss to tell you afterwards whether the latter was made up of\r\ncoal-fields or of vineyards. He was wholly given up to his grievance,\r\nof which reflection by no means diminished the weight. He feared that\r\nMadame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 was irretrievably lost; and yet, as he would have said\r\nhimself, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t see his way clear to giving her up. He found it\r\nimpossible to turn his back upon Fleuri\xc3\xa8res and its inhabitants; it\r\nseemed to him that some germ of hope or reparation must lurk there\r\nsomewhere, if he could only stretch his arm out far enough to pluck it.\r\nIt was as if he had his hand on a door-knob and were closing his\r\nclenched fist upon it: he had thumped, he had called, he had pressed\r\nthe door with his powerful knee and shaken it with all his strength,\r\nand dead, damning silence had answered him. And yet something held him\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x94something hardened the grasp of his fingers. Newman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsatisfaction had been too intense, his whole plan too deliberate and\r\nmature, his prospect of happiness too rich and comprehensive for this\r\nfine moral fabric to crumble at a stroke. The very foundation seemed\r\nfatally injured, and yet he felt a stubborn desire still to try to save\r\nthe edifice. He was filled with a sorer sense of wrong than he had ever\r\nknown, or than he had supposed it possible he should know. To accept\r\nhis injury and walk away without looking behind him was a stretch of\r\ngood-nature of which he found himself incapable. He looked behind him\r\nintently and continually, and what he saw there did not assuage his\r\nresentment. He saw himself trustful, generous, liberal, patient, easy,\r\npocketing frequent irritation and furnishing unlimited modesty. To have\r\neaten humble pie, to have been snubbed and patronized and satirized and\r\nhave consented to take it as one of the conditions of the bargain\xe2\x80\x94to\r\nhave done this, and done it all for nothing, surely gave one a right to\r\nprotest. And to be turned off because one was a commercial person! As\r\nif he had ever talked or dreamt of the commercial since his connection\r\nwith the Bellegardes began\xe2\x80\x94as if he had made the least circumstance of\r\nthe commercial\xe2\x80\x94as if he would not have consented to confound the\r\ncommercial fifty times a day, if it might have increased by a hair\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbreadth the chance of the Bellegardes\xe2\x80\x99 not playing him a trick! Granted\r\nthat being commercial was fair ground for having a trick played upon\r\none, how little they knew about the class so designed and its\r\nenterprising way of not standing upon trifles! It was in the light of\r\nhis injury that the weight of Newman\xe2\x80\x99s past endurance seemed so heavy;\r\nhis actual irritation had not been so great, merged as it was in his\r\nvision of the cloudless blue that overarched his immediate wooing. But\r\nnow his sense of outrage was deep, rancorous, and ever present; he felt\r\nthat he was a good fellow wronged. As for Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s conduct,\r\nit struck him with a kind of awe, and the fact that he was powerless to\r\nunderstand it or feel the reality of its motives only deepened the\r\nforce with which he had attached himself to her. He had never let the\r\nfact of her Catholicism trouble him; Catholicism to him was nothing but\r\na name, and to express a mistrust of the form in which her religious\r\nfeelings had moulded themselves would have seemed to him on his own\r\npart a rather pretentious affectation of Protestant zeal. If such\r\nsuperb white flowers as that could bloom in Catholic soil, the soil was\r\nnot insalubrious. But it was one thing to be a Catholic, and another to\r\nturn nun\xe2\x80\x94on your hand! There was something lugubriously comical in the\r\nway Newman\xe2\x80\x99s thoroughly contemporaneous optimism was confronted with\r\nthis dusky old-world expedient. To see a woman made for him and for\r\nmotherhood to his children juggled away in this tragic travesty\xe2\x80\x94it was\r\na thing to rub one\xe2\x80\x99s eyes over, a nightmare, an illusion, a hoax. But\r\nthe hours passed away without disproving the thing, and leaving him\r\nonly the after-sense of the vehemence with which he had embraced Madame\r\nde Cintr\xc3\xa9. He remembered her words and her looks; he turned them over\r\nand tried to shake the mystery out of them and to infuse them with an\r\nendurable meaning. What had she meant by her feeling being a kind of\r\nreligion? It was the religion simply of the family laws, the religion\r\nof which her implacable little mother was the high priestess. Twist the\r\nthing about as her generosity would, the one certain fact was that they\r\nhad used force against her. Her generosity had tried to screen them,\r\nbut Newman\xe2\x80\x99s heart rose into his throat at the thought that they should\r\ngo scot-free.\r\n\r\nThe twenty-four hours wore themselves away, and the next morning Newman\r\nsprang to his feet with the resolution to return to Fleuri\xc3\xa8res and\r\ndemand another interview with Madame de Bellegarde and her son. He lost\r\nno time in putting it into practice. As he rolled swiftly over the\r\nexcellent road in the little cal\xc3\xa8che furnished him at the inn at\r\nPoitiers, he drew forth, as it were, from the very safe place in his\r\nmind to which he had consigned it, the last information given him by\r\npoor Valentin. Valentin had told him he could do something with it, and\r\nNewman thought it would be well to have it at hand. This was of course\r\nnot the first time, lately, that Newman had given it his attention. It\r\nwas information in the rough,\xe2\x80\x94it was dark and puzzling; but Newman was\r\nneither helpless nor afraid. Valentin had evidently meant to put him in\r\npossession of a powerful instrument, though he could not be said to\r\nhave placed the handle very securely within his grasp. But if he had\r\nnot really told him the secret, he had at least given him the clew to\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94a clew of which that queer old Mrs. Bread held the other end. Mrs.\r\nBread had always looked to Newman as if she knew secrets; and as he\r\napparently enjoyed her esteem, he suspected she might be induced to\r\nshare her knowledge with him. So long as there was only Mrs. Bread to\r\ndeal with, he felt easy. As to what there was to find out, he had only\r\none fear\xe2\x80\x94that it might not be bad enough. Then, when the image of the\r\nmarquise and her son rose before him again, standing side by side, the\r\nold woman\xe2\x80\x99s hand in Urbain\xe2\x80\x99s arm, and the same cold, unsociable\r\nfixedness in the eyes of each, he cried out to himself that the fear\r\nwas groundless. There was blood in the secret at the very least! He\r\narrived at Fleuri\xc3\xa8res almost in a state of elation; he had satisfied\r\nhimself, logically, that in the presence of his threat of exposure they\r\nwould, as he mentally phrased it, rattle down like unwound buckets. He\r\nremembered indeed that he must first catch his hare\xe2\x80\x94first ascertain\r\nwhat there was to expose; but after that, why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t his happiness\r\nbe as good as new again? Mother and son would drop their lovely victim\r\nin terror and take to hiding, and Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9, left to herself,\r\nwould surely come back to him. Give her a chance and she would rise to\r\nthe surface, return to the light. How could she fail to perceive that\r\nhis house would be much the most comfortable sort of convent?\r\n\r\nNewman, as he had done before, left his conveyance at the inn and\r\nwalked the short remaining distance to the ch\xc3\xa2teau. When he reached the\r\ngate, however, a singular feeling took possession of him\xe2\x80\x94a feeling\r\nwhich, strange as it may seem, had its source in its unfathomable good\r\nnature. He stood there a while, looking through the bars at the large,\r\ntime-stained face of the edifice, and wondering to what crime it was\r\nthat the dark old house, with its flowery name, had given convenient\r\noccasion. It had given occasion, first and last, to tyrannies and\r\nsufferings enough, Newman said to himself; it was an evil-looking place\r\nto live in. Then, suddenly, came the reflection\xe2\x80\x94What a horrible\r\nrubbish-heap of iniquity to fumble in! The attitude of inquisitor\r\nturned its ignobler face, and with the same movement Newman declared\r\nthat the Bellegardes should have another chance. He would appeal once\r\nmore directly to their sense of fairness, and not to their fear, and if\r\nthey should be accessible to reason, he need know nothing worse about\r\nthem than what he already knew. That was bad enough.\r\n\r\nThe gate-keeper let him in through the same stiff crevice as before,\r\nand he passed through the court and over the little rustic bridge on\r\nthe moat. The door was opened before he had reached it, and, as if to\r\nput his clemency to rout with the suggestion of a richer opportunity,\r\nMrs. Bread stood there awaiting him. Her face, as usual, looked as\r\nhopelessly blank as the tide-smoothed sea-sand, and her black garments\r\nseemed of an intenser sable. Newman had already learned that her\r\nstrange inexpressiveness could be a vehicle for emotion, and he was not\r\nsurprised at the muffled vivacity with which she whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cI thought\r\nyou would try again, sir. I was looking out for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad to see you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman; \xe2\x80\x9cI think you are my friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Bread looked at him opaquely. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish you well sir; but it\xe2\x80\x99s vain\r\nwishing now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know, then, how they have treated me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bread, dryly, \xe2\x80\x9cI know everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman hesitated a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cEverything?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Bread gave him a glance somewhat more lucent. \xe2\x80\x9cI know at least too\r\nmuch, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne can never know too much. I congratulate you. I have come to see\r\nMadame de Bellegarde and her son,\xe2\x80\x9d Newman added. \xe2\x80\x9cAre they at home? If\r\nthey are not, I will wait.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy lady is always at home,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Bread replied, \xe2\x80\x9cand the marquis is\r\nmostly with her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease then tell them\xe2\x80\x94one or the other, or both\xe2\x80\x94that I am here and\r\nthat I desire to see them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Bread hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cMay I take a great liberty, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have never taken a liberty but you have justified it,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nNewman, with diplomatic urbanity.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bread dropped her wrinkled eyelids as if she were curtseying; but\r\nthe curtsey stopped there; the occasion was too grave. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have come\r\nto plead with them again, sir? Perhaps you don\xe2\x80\x99t know this\xe2\x80\x94that Madame\r\nde Cintr\xc3\xa9 returned this morning to Paris.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, she\xe2\x80\x99s gone!\xe2\x80\x9d And Newman, groaning, smote the pavement with his\r\nstick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has gone straight to the convent\xe2\x80\x94the Carmelites they call it. I\r\nsee you know, sir. My lady and the marquis take it very ill. It was\r\nonly last night she told them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, she had kept it back, then?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cGood, good! And they\r\nare very fierce?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are not pleased,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bread. \xe2\x80\x9cBut they may well dislike it.\r\nThey tell me it\xe2\x80\x99s most dreadful, sir; of all the nuns in Christendom\r\nthe Carmelites are the worst. You may say they are really not human,\r\nsir; they make you give up everything\xe2\x80\x94forever. And to think of _her_\r\nthere! If I was one that cried, sir, I could cry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman looked at her an instant. \xe2\x80\x9cWe mustn\xe2\x80\x99t cry, Mrs. Bread; we must\r\nact. Go and call them!\xe2\x80\x9d And he made a movement to enter farther.\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Bread gently checked him. \xe2\x80\x9cMay I take another liberty? I am\r\ntold you were with my dearest Mr. Valentin, in his last hours. If you\r\nwould tell me a word about him! The poor count was my own boy, sir; for\r\nthe first year of his life he was hardly out of my arms; I taught him\r\nto speak. And the count spoke so well, sir! He always spoke well to his\r\npoor old Bread. When he grew up and took his pleasure he always had a\r\nkind word for me. And to die in that wild way! They have a story that\r\nhe fought with a wine-merchant. I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe that, sir! And was he\r\nin great pain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a wise, kind old woman, Mrs. Bread,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cI hoped I\r\nmight see you with my own children in your arms. Perhaps I shall, yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAnd he put out his hand. Mrs. Bread looked for a moment at his open\r\npalm, and then, as if fascinated by the novelty of the gesture,\r\nextended her own ladylike fingers. Newman held her hand firmly and\r\ndeliberately, fixing his eyes upon her. \xe2\x80\x9cYou want to know all about Mr.\r\nValentin?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be a sad pleasure, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can tell you everything. Can you sometimes leave this place?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe ch\xc3\xa2teau, sir? I really don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I never tried.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTry, then; try hard. Try this evening, at dusk. Come to me in the old\r\nruin there on the hill, in the court before the church. I will wait for\r\nyou there; I have something very important to tell you. An old woman\r\nlike you can do as she pleases.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Bread stared, wondering, with parted lips. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it from the count,\r\nsir?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom the count\xe2\x80\x94from his death-bed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will come, then. I will be bold, for once, for _him_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe led Newman into the great drawing-room with which he had already\r\nmade acquaintance, and retired to execute his commands. Newman waited a\r\nlong time; at last he was on the point of ringing and repeating his\r\nrequest. He was looking round him for a bell when the marquis came in\r\nwith his mother on his arm. It will be seen that Newman had a logical\r\nmind when I say that he declared to himself, in perfect good faith, as\r\na result of Valentin\xe2\x80\x99s dark hints, that his adversaries looked grossly\r\nwicked. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no mistake about it now,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself as they\r\nadvanced. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re a bad lot; they have pulled off the mask.\xe2\x80\x9d Madame de\r\nBellegarde and her son certainly bore in their faces the signs of\r\nextreme perturbation; they looked like people who had passed a\r\nsleepless night. Confronted, moreover, with an annoyance which they\r\nhoped they had disposed of, it was not natural that they should have\r\nany very tender glances to bestow upon Newman. He stood before them,\r\nand such eye-beams as they found available they leveled at him; Newman\r\nfeeling as if the door of a sepulchre had suddenly been opened, and the\r\ndamp darkness were being exhaled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see I have come back,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI have come to try again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be ridiculous,\xe2\x80\x9d said M. de Bellegarde, \xe2\x80\x9cto pretend that we\r\nare glad to see you or that we don\xe2\x80\x99t question the taste of your visit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t talk about taste,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, with a laugh, \xe2\x80\x9cor that will\r\nbring us round to yours! If I consulted my taste I certainly shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncome to see you. Besides, I will make as short work as you please.\r\nPromise me to raise the blockade\xe2\x80\x94to set Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 at liberty\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nI will retire instantly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe hesitated as to whether we would see you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de\r\nBellegarde; \xe2\x80\x9cand we were on the point of declining the honor. But it\r\nseemed to me that we should act with civility, as we have always done,\r\nand I wished to have the satisfaction of informing you that there are\r\ncertain weaknesses that people of our way of feeling can be guilty of\r\nbut once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may be weak but once, but you will be audacious many times,\r\nmadam,\xe2\x80\x9d Newman answered. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t come however, for conversational\r\npurposes. I came to say this, simply: that if you will write\r\nimmediately to your daughter that you withdraw your opposition to her\r\nmarriage, I will take care of the rest. You don\xe2\x80\x99t want her to turn\r\nnun\xe2\x80\x94you know more about the horrors of it than I do. Marrying a\r\ncommercial person is better than that. Give me a letter to her, signed\r\nand sealed, saying you retract and that she may marry me with your\r\nblessing, and I will take it to her at the convent and bring her out.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s your chance\xe2\x80\x94I call those easy terms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe look at the matter otherwise, you know. We call them very hard\r\nterms,\xe2\x80\x9d said Urbain de Bellegarde. They had all remained standing\r\nrigidly in the middle of the room. \xe2\x80\x9cI think my mother will tell you\r\nthat she would rather her daughter should become S\xc5\x93ur Catherine than\r\nMrs. Newman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the old lady, with the serenity of supreme power, let her son make\r\nher epigrams for her. She only smiled, almost sweetly, shaking her head\r\nand repeating, \xe2\x80\x9cBut once, Mr. Newman; but once!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNothing that Newman had ever seen or heard gave him such a sense of\r\nmarble hardness as this movement and the tone that accompanied it.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCould anything compel you?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know of anything that\r\nwould force you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis language, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the marquis, \xe2\x80\x9caddressed to people in\r\nbereavement and grief is beyond all qualification.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn most cases,\xe2\x80\x9d Newman answered, \xe2\x80\x9cyour objection would have some\r\nweight, even admitting that Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s present intentions make\r\ntime precious. But I have thought of what you speak of, and I have come\r\nhere to-day without scruple simply because I consider your brother and\r\nyou two very different parties. I see no connection between you. Your\r\nbrother was ashamed of you. Lying there wounded and dying, the poor\r\nfellow apologized to me for your conduct. He apologized to me for that\r\nof his mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a moment the effect of these words was as if Newman had struck a\r\nphysical blow. A quick flush leaped into the faces of Madame de\r\nBellegarde and her son, and they exchanged a glance like a twinkle of\r\nsteel. Urbain uttered two words which Newman but half heard, but of\r\nwhich the sense came to him as it were in the reverberation of the\r\nsound, \xe2\x80\x9c_Le mis\xc3\xa9rable!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou show little respect for the living,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de Bellegarde,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut at least respect the dead. Don\xe2\x80\x99t profane\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t insult\xe2\x80\x94the memory\r\nof my innocent son.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI speak the simple truth,\xe2\x80\x9d Newman declared, \xe2\x80\x9cand I speak it for a\r\npurpose. I repeat it\xe2\x80\x94distinctly. Your son was utterly disgusted\xe2\x80\x94your\r\nson apologized.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUrbain de Bellegarde was frowning portentously, and Newman supposed he\r\nwas frowning at poor Valentin\xe2\x80\x99s invidious image. Taken by surprise, his\r\nscant affection for his brother had made a momentary concession to\r\ndishonor. But not for an appreciable instant did his mother lower her\r\nflag. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are immensely mistaken, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cMy son was\r\nsometimes light, but he was never indecent. He died faithful to his\r\nname.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou simply misunderstood him,\xe2\x80\x9d said the marquis, beginning to rally.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou affirm the impossible!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t care for poor Valentin\xe2\x80\x99s apology,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was\r\nfar more painful than pleasant to me. This atrocious thing was not his\r\nfault; he never hurt me, or anyone else; he was the soul of honor. But\r\nit shows how he took it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you wish to prove that my poor brother, in his last moments, was\r\nout of his head, we can only say that under the melancholy\r\ncircumstances nothing was more possible. But confine yourself to that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was quite in his right mind,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, with gentle but\r\ndangerous doggedness; \xe2\x80\x9cI have never seen him so bright and clever. It\r\nwas terrible to see that witty, capable fellow dying such a death. You\r\nknow I was very fond of your brother. And I have further proof of his\r\nsanity,\xe2\x80\x9d Newman concluded.\r\n\r\nThe marquise gathered herself together majestically. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is too\r\ngross!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cWe decline to accept your story, sir\xe2\x80\x94we repudiate\r\nit. Urbain, open the door.\xe2\x80\x9d She turned away, with an imperious motion\r\nto her son, and passed rapidly down the length of the room. The marquis\r\nwent with her and held the door open. Newman was left standing.\r\n\r\nHe lifted his finger, as a sign to M. de Bellegarde, who closed the\r\ndoor behind his mother and stood waiting. Newman slowly advanced, more\r\nsilent, for the moment, than life. The two men stood face to face. Then\r\nNewman had a singular sensation; he felt his sense of injury almost\r\nbrimming over into jocularity. \xe2\x80\x9cCome,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou don\xe2\x80\x99t treat me\r\nwell; at least admit that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. de Bellegarde looked at him from head to foot, and then, in the most\r\ndelicate, best-bred voice, \xe2\x80\x9cI detest you personally,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the way I feel to you, but for politeness sake I don\xe2\x80\x99t say it,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s singular I should want so much to be your\r\nbrother-in-law, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t give it up. Let me try once more.\xe2\x80\x9d And he\r\npaused a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have a secret\xe2\x80\x94you have a skeleton in the closet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nM. de Bellegarde continued to look at him hard, but Newman could not\r\nsee whether his eyes betrayed anything; the look of his eyes was always\r\nso strange. Newman paused again, and then went on. \xe2\x80\x9cYou and your mother\r\nhave committed a crime.\xe2\x80\x9d At this M. de Bellegarde\xe2\x80\x99s eyes certainly did\r\nchange; they seemed to flicker, like blown candles. Newman could see\r\nthat he was profoundly startled; but there was something admirable in\r\nhis self-control.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cContinue,\xe2\x80\x9d said M. de Bellegarde.\r\n\r\nNewman lifted a finger and made it waver a little in the air. \xe2\x80\x9cNeed I\r\ncontinue? You are trembling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray where did you obtain this interesting information?\xe2\x80\x9d M. de\r\nBellegarde asked, very softly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall be strictly accurate,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t pretend to know\r\nmore than I do. At present that is all I know. You have done something\r\nthat you must hide, something that would damn you if it were known,\r\nsomething that would disgrace the name you are so proud of. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow what it is, but I can find out. Persist in your present course and\r\nI _will_ find out. Change it, let your sister go in peace, and I will\r\nleave you alone. It\xe2\x80\x99s a bargain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe marquis almost succeeded in looking untroubled; the breaking up of\r\nthe ice in his handsome countenance was an operation that was\r\nnecessarily gradual. But Newman\xe2\x80\x99s mildly-syllabled argumentation seemed\r\nto press, and press, and presently he averted his eyes. He stood some\r\nmoments, reflecting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy brother told you this,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, looking up.\r\n\r\nNewman hesitated a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, your brother told me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe marquis smiled, handsomely. \xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t I say that he was out of his\r\nmind?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was out of his mind if I don\xe2\x80\x99t find out. He was very much in it if\r\nI do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. de Bellegarde gave a shrug. \xe2\x80\x9cEh, sir, find out or not, as you\r\nplease.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t frighten you?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s for you to judge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it\xe2\x80\x99s for you to judge, at your leisure. Think it over, feel\r\nyourself all round. I will give you an hour or two. I can\xe2\x80\x99t give you\r\nmore, for how do we know how fast they may be making Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 a\r\nnun? Talk it over with your mother; let her judge whether she is\r\nfrightened. I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe she is as easily frightened, in general, as\r\nyou; but you will see. I will go and wait in the village, at the inn,\r\nand I beg you to let me know as soon as possible. Say by three o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\r\nA simple _yes_ or _no_ on paper will do. Only, you know, in case of a\r\n_yes_ I shall expect you, this time, to stick to your bargain.\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nwith this Newman opened the door and let himself out. The marquis did\r\nnot move, and Newman, retiring, gave him another look. \xe2\x80\x9cAt the inn, in\r\nthe village,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated. Then he turned away altogether and passed\r\nout of the house.\r\n\r\nHe was extremely excited by what he had been doing, for it was\r\ninevitable that there should be a certain emotion in calling up the\r\nspectre of dishonor before a family a thousand years old. But he went\r\nback to the inn and contrived to wait there, deliberately, for the next\r\ntwo hours. He thought it more than probable that Urbain de Bellegarde\r\nwould give no sign; for an answer to his challenge, in either sense,\r\nwould be a confession of guilt. What he most expected was silence\xe2\x80\x94in\r\nother words defiance. But he prayed that, as he imagined it, his shot\r\nmight bring them down. It did bring, by three o\xe2\x80\x99clock, a note,\r\ndelivered by a footman; a note addressed in Urbain de Bellegarde\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhandsome English hand. It ran as follows:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot deny myself the satisfaction of letting you know that I\r\nreturn to Paris, to-morrow, with my mother, in order that we may see my\r\nsister and confirm her in the resolution which is the most effectual\r\nreply to your audacious pertinacity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHENRI-URBAIN DE BELLEGARDE.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nNewman put the letter into his pocket, and continued his walk up and\r\ndown the inn-parlor. He had spent most of his time, for the past week,\r\nin walking up and down. He continued to measure the length of the\r\nlittle _salle_ of the Armes de France until the day began to wane, when\r\nhe went out to keep his rendezvous with Mrs. Bread. The path which led\r\nup the hill to the ruin was easy to find, and Newman in a short time\r\nhad followed it to the top. He passed beneath the rugged arch of the\r\ncastle wall, and looked about him in the early dusk for an old woman in\r\nblack. The castle yard was empty, but the door of the church was open.\r\nNewman went into the little nave and of course found a deeper dusk than\r\nwithout. A couple of tapers, however, twinkled on the altar and just\r\nenabled him to perceive a figure seated by one of the pillars. Closer\r\ninspection helped him to recognize Mrs. Bread, in spite of the fact\r\nthat she was dressed with unwonted splendor. She wore a large black\r\nsilk bonnet, with imposing bows of crape, and an old black satin dress\r\ndisposed itself in vaguely lustrous folds about her person. She had\r\njudged it proper to the occasion to appear in her stateliest apparel.\r\nShe had been sitting with her eyes fixed upon the ground, but when\r\nNewman passed before her she looked up at him, and then she rose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you a Catholic, Mrs. Bread?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir; I\xe2\x80\x99m a good Church-of-England woman, very Low,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I thought I should be safer in here than outside. I was never out\r\nin the evening before, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall be safer,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere no one can hear us.\xe2\x80\x9d And he\r\nled the way back into the castle court and then followed a path beside\r\nthe church, which he was sure must lead into another part of the ruin.\r\nHe was not deceived. It wandered along the crest of the hill and\r\nterminated before a fragment of wall pierced by a rough aperture which\r\nhad once been a door. Through this aperture Newman passed and found\r\nhimself in a nook peculiarly favorable to quiet conversation, as\r\nprobably many an earnest couple, otherwise assorted than our friends,\r\nhad assured themselves. The hill sloped abruptly away, and on the\r\nremnant of its crest were scattered two or three fragments of stone.\r\nBeneath, over the plain, lay the gathered twilight, through which, in\r\nthe near distance, gleamed two or three lights from the ch\xc3\xa2teau. Mrs.\r\nBread rustled slowly after her guide, and Newman, satisfying himself\r\nthat one of the fallen stones was steady, proposed to her to sit upon\r\nit. She cautiously complied, and he placed himself upon another, near\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very much obliged to you for coming,\xe2\x80\x9d Newman said. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope it\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t get you into trouble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I shall be missed. My lady, in these days, is not fond\r\nof having me about her.\xe2\x80\x9d This was said with a certain fluttered\r\neagerness which increased Newman\xe2\x80\x99s sense of having inspired the old\r\nwoman with confidence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom the first, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, \xe2\x80\x9cyou took an interest in my\r\nprospects. You were on my side. That gratified me, I assure you. And\r\nnow that you know what they have done to me, I am sure you are with me\r\nall the more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey have not done well\xe2\x80\x94I must say it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bread. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you\r\nmustn\xe2\x80\x99t blame the poor countess; they pressed her hard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would give a million of dollars to know what they did to her!\xe2\x80\x9d cried\r\nNewman.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bread sat with a dull, oblique gaze fixed upon the lights of the\r\nch\xc3\xa2teau. \xe2\x80\x9cThey worked on her feelings; they knew that was the way. She\r\nis a delicate creature. They made her feel wicked. She is only too\r\ngood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, they made her feel wicked,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, slowly; and then he\r\nrepeated it. \xe2\x80\x9cThey made her feel wicked,\xe2\x80\x94they made her feel wicked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThe words seemed to him for the moment a vivid description of infernal\r\ningenuity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was because she was so good that she gave up\xe2\x80\x94poor sweet lady!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nadded Mrs. Bread.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut she was better to them than to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was afraid,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bread, very confidently; \xe2\x80\x9cshe has always\r\nbeen afraid, or at least for a long time. That was the real trouble,\r\nsir. She was like a fair peach, I may say, with just one little speck.\r\nShe had one little sad spot. You pushed her into the sunshine, sir, and\r\nit almost disappeared. Then they pulled her back into the shade and in\r\na moment it began to spread. Before we knew it she was gone. She was a\r\ndelicate creature.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis singular attestation of Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s delicacy, for all its\r\nsingularity, set Newman\xe2\x80\x99s wound aching afresh. \xe2\x80\x9cI see,\xe2\x80\x9d he presently\r\nsaid; \xe2\x80\x9cshe knew something bad about her mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir, she knew nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bread, holding her head very\r\nstiff and keeping her eyes fixed upon the glimmering windows of the\r\nch\xc3\xa2teau.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe guessed something, then, or suspected it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was afraid to know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bread.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut _you_ know, at any rate,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\nShe slowly turned her vague eyes upon Newman, squeezing her hands\r\ntogether in her lap. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are not quite faithful, sir. I thought it was\r\nto tell me about Mr. Valentin you asked me to come here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, the more we talk of Mr. Valentin the better,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nexactly what I want. I was with him, as I told you, in his last hour.\r\nHe was in a great deal of pain, but he was quite himself. You know what\r\nthat means; he was bright and lively and clever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, he would always be clever, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bread. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd did he know\r\nof your trouble?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, he guessed it of himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what did he say to it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe said it was a disgrace to his name\xe2\x80\x94but it was not the first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord, Lord!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Mrs. Bread.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe said that his mother and his brother had once put their heads\r\ntogether and invented something even worse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have listened to that, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps not. But I _did_ listen, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t forget it. Now I want to\r\nknow what it is they did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Bread gave a soft moan. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you have enticed me up into this\r\nstrange place to tell you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be alarmed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t say a word that shall be\r\ndisagreeable to you. Tell me as it suits you, and when it suits you.\r\nOnly remember that it was Mr. Valentin\xe2\x80\x99s last wish that you should.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid he say that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe said it with his last breath\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Tell Mrs. Bread I told you to ask\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t he tell you himself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was too long a story for a dying man; he had no breath left in his\r\nbody. He could only say that he wanted me to know\xe2\x80\x94that, wronged as I\r\nwas, it was my right to know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how will it help you, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bread.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s for me to decide. Mr. Valentin believed it would, and that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhy he told me. Your name was almost the last word he spoke.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Bread was evidently awe-struck by this statement; she shook her\r\nclasped hands slowly up and down. \xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cif I\r\ntake a great liberty. Is it the solemn truth you are speaking? I _must_\r\nask you that; must I not, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no offense. It _is_ the solemn truth; I solemnly swear it. Mr.\r\nValentin himself would certainly have told me more if he had been\r\nable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, sir, if he knew more!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you suppose he did?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no saying what he knew about anything,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bread, with\r\na mild head-shake. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was so mightily clever. He could make you\r\nbelieve he knew things that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t, and that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know others\r\nthat he had better not have known.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suspect he knew something about his brother that kept the marquis\r\ncivil to him,\xe2\x80\x9d Newman propounded; \xe2\x80\x9che made the marquis feel him. What\r\nhe wanted now was to put me in his place; he wanted to give me a chance\r\nto make the marquis feel _me_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMercy on us!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the old waiting-woman, \xe2\x80\x9chow wicked we all are!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman; \xe2\x80\x9csome of us are wicked, certainly. I am\r\nvery angry, I am very sore, and I am very bitter, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that\r\nI am wicked. I have been cruelly injured. They have hurt me, and I want\r\nto hurt them. I don\xe2\x80\x99t deny that; on the contrary, I tell you plainly\r\nthat it is the use I want to make of your secret.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Bread seemed to hold her breath. \xe2\x80\x9cYou want to publish them\xe2\x80\x94you\r\nwant to shame them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to bring them down,\xe2\x80\x94down, down, down! I want to turn the tables\r\nupon them\xe2\x80\x94I want to mortify them as they mortified me. They took me up\r\ninto a high place and made me stand there for all the world to see me,\r\nand then they stole behind me and pushed me into this bottomless pit,\r\nwhere I lie howling and gnashing my teeth! I made a fool of myself\r\nbefore all their friends; but I shall make something worse of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis passionate sally, which Newman uttered with the greater fervor\r\nthat it was the first time he had had a chance to say all this aloud,\r\nkindled two small sparks in Mrs. Bread\xe2\x80\x99s fixed eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you\r\nhave a right to your anger, sir; but think of the dishonor you will\r\ndraw down on Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 is buried alive,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are honor or\r\ndishonor to her? The door of the tomb is at this moment closing behind\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it\xe2\x80\x99s most awful,\xe2\x80\x9d moaned Mrs. Bread.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has moved off, like her brother Valentin, to give me room to work.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s as if it were done on purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bread, apparently impressed by the ingenuity of\r\nthis reflection. She was silent for some moments; then she added, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nwould you bring my lady before the courts?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe courts care nothing for my lady,\xe2\x80\x9d Newman replied. \xe2\x80\x9cIf she has\r\ncommitted a crime, she will be nothing for the courts but a wicked old\r\nwoman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd will they hang her, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat depends upon what she has done.\xe2\x80\x9d And Newman eyed Mrs. Bread\r\nintently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would break up the family most terribly, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s time such a family should be broken up!\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, with a\r\nlaugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd me at my age out of place, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d sighed Mrs. Bread.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I will take care of you! You shall come and live with me. You\r\nshall be my housekeeper, or anything you like. I will pension you for\r\nlife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear, dear, sir, you think of everything.\xe2\x80\x9d And she seemed to fall\r\na-brooding.\r\n\r\nNewman watched her a while, and then he said suddenly. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, Mrs. Bread,\r\nyou are too fond of my lady!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at him as quickly. \xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have you say that, sir. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t think it any part of my duty to be fond of my lady. I have served\r\nher faithfully this many a year; but if she were to die to-morrow, I\r\nbelieve, before Heaven I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t shed a tear for her.\xe2\x80\x9d Then, after a\r\npause, \xe2\x80\x9cI have no reason to love her!\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Bread added. \xe2\x80\x9cThe most she\r\nhas done for me has been not to turn me out of the house.\xe2\x80\x9d Newman felt\r\nthat decidedly his companion was more and more confidential\xe2\x80\x94that if\r\nluxury is corrupting, Mrs. Bread\xe2\x80\x99s conservative habits were already\r\nrelaxed by the spiritual comfort of this preconcerted interview, in a\r\nremarkable locality, with a free-spoken millionaire. All his native\r\nshrewdness admonished him that his part was simply to let her take her\r\ntime\xe2\x80\x94let the charm of the occasion work. So he said nothing; he only\r\nlooked at her kindly. Mrs. Bread sat nursing her lean elbows. \xe2\x80\x9cMy lady\r\nonce did me a great wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on at last. \xe2\x80\x9cShe has a terrible\r\ntongue when she is vexed. It was many a year ago, but I have never\r\nforgotten it. I have never mentioned it to a human creature; I have\r\nkept my grudge to myself. I dare say I have been wicked, but my grudge\r\nhas grown old with me. It has grown good for nothing, too, I dare say;\r\nbut it has lived along, as I have lived. It will die when I die,\xe2\x80\x94not\r\nbefore!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what _is_ your grudge?\xe2\x80\x9d Newman asked.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bread dropped her eyes and hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I were a foreigner, sir,\r\nI should make less of telling you; it comes harder to a decent\r\nEnglishwoman. But I sometimes think I have picked up too many foreign\r\nways. What I was telling you belongs to a time when I was much younger\r\nand very different looking to what I am now. I had a very high color,\r\nsir, if you can believe it, indeed I was a very smart lass. My lady was\r\nyounger, too, and the late marquis was youngest of all\xe2\x80\x94I mean in the\r\nway he went on, sir; he had a very high spirit; he was a magnificent\r\nman. He was fond of his pleasure, like most foreigners, and it must be\r\nowned that he sometimes went rather below him to take it. My lady was\r\noften jealous, and, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll believe it, sir, she did me the honor to\r\nbe jealous of me. One day I had a red ribbon in my cap, and my lady\r\nflew out at me and ordered me to take it off. She accused me of putting\r\nit on to make the marquis look at me. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I was\r\nimpertinent, but I spoke up like an honest girl and didn\xe2\x80\x99t count my\r\nwords. A red ribbon indeed! As if it was my ribbons the marquis looked\r\nat! My lady knew afterwards that I was perfectly respectable, but she\r\nnever said a word to show that she believed it. But the marquis did!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nMrs. Bread presently added, \xe2\x80\x9cI took off my red ribbon and put it away\r\nin a drawer, where I have kept it to this day. It\xe2\x80\x99s faded now, it\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nvery pale pink; but there it lies. My grudge has faded, too; the red\r\nhas all gone out of it; but it lies here yet.\xe2\x80\x9d And Mrs. Bread stroked\r\nher black satin bodice.\r\n\r\nNewman listened with interest to this decent narrative, which seemed to\r\nhave opened up the deeps of memory to his companion. Then, as she\r\nremained silent, and seemed to be losing herself in retrospective\r\nmeditation upon her perfect respectability, he ventured upon a short\r\ncut to his goal. \xe2\x80\x9cSo Madame de Bellegarde was jealous; I see. And M. de\r\nBellegarde admired pretty women, without distinction of class. I\r\nsuppose one mustn\xe2\x80\x99t be hard upon him, for they probably didn\xe2\x80\x99t all\r\nbehave so properly as you. But years afterwards it could hardly have\r\nbeen jealousy that turned Madame de Bellegarde into a criminal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Bread gave a weary sigh. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are using dreadful words, sir, but I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t care now. I see you have your idea, and I have no will of my own.\r\nMy will was the will of my children, as I called them; but I have lost\r\nmy children now. They are dead\xe2\x80\x94I may say it of both of them; and what\r\nshould I care for the living? What is anyone in the house to me\r\nnow\xe2\x80\x94what am I to them? My lady objects to me\xe2\x80\x94she has objected to me\r\nthese thirty years. I should have been glad to be something to young\r\nMadame de Bellegarde, though I never was nurse to the present marquis.\r\nWhen he was a baby I was too young; they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t trust me with him.\r\nBut his wife told her own maid, Mamselle Clarisse, the opinion she had\r\nof me. Perhaps you would like to hear it, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, immensely,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe said that if I would sit in her children\xe2\x80\x99s schoolroom I should do\r\nvery well for a penwiper! When things have come to that I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\r\nneed stand upon ceremony.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDecidedly not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cGo on, Mrs. Bread.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Bread, however, relapsed again into troubled dumbness, and all\r\nNewman could do was to fold his arms and wait. But at last she appeared\r\nto have set her memories in order. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was when the late marquis was an\r\nold man and his eldest son had been two years married. It was when the\r\ntime came on for marrying Mademoiselle Claire; that\xe2\x80\x99s the way they talk\r\nof it here, you know, sir. The marquis\xe2\x80\x99s health was bad; he was very\r\nmuch broken down. My lady had picked out M. de Cintr\xc3\xa9, for no good\r\nreason that I could see. But there are reasons, I very well know, that\r\nare beyond me, and you must be high in the world to understand them.\r\nOld M. de Cintr\xc3\xa9 was very high, and my lady thought him almost as good\r\nas herself; that\xe2\x80\x99s saying a good deal. Mr. Urbain took sides with his\r\nmother, as he always did. The trouble, I believe, was that my lady\r\nwould give very little money, and all the other gentlemen asked more.\r\nIt was only M. de Cintr\xc3\xa9 that was satisfied. The Lord willed it he\r\nshould have that one soft spot; it was the only one he had. He may have\r\nbeen very grand in his birth, and he certainly was very grand in his\r\nbows and speeches; but that was all the grandeur he had. I think he was\r\nlike what I have heard of comedians; not that I have ever seen one. But\r\nI know he painted his face. He might paint it all he would; he could\r\nnever make me like it! The marquis couldn\xe2\x80\x99t abide him, and declared\r\nthat sooner than take such a husband as that Mademoiselle Claire should\r\ntake none at all. He and my lady had a great scene; it came even to our\r\nears in the servants\xe2\x80\x99 hall. It was not their first quarrel, if the\r\ntruth must be told. They were not a loving couple, but they didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\noften come to words, because, I think, neither of them thought the\r\nother\xe2\x80\x99s doings worth the trouble. My lady had long ago got over her\r\njealousy, and she had taken to indifference. In this, I must say, they\r\nwere well matched. The marquis was very easy-going; he had a most\r\ngentlemanly temper. He got angry only once a year, but then it was very\r\nbad. He always took to bed directly afterwards. This time I speak of he\r\ntook to bed as usual, but he never got up again. I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid the poor\r\ngentleman was paying for his dissipation; isn\xe2\x80\x99t it true they mostly do,\r\nsir, when they get old? My lady and Mr. Urbain kept quiet, but I know\r\nmy lady wrote letters to M. de Cintr\xc3\xa9. The marquis got worse and the\r\ndoctors gave him up. My lady, she gave him up too, and if the truth\r\nmust be told, she gave him up gladly. When once he was out of the way\r\nshe could do what she pleased with her daughter, and it was all\r\narranged that my poor innocent child should be handed over to M. de\r\nCintr\xc3\xa9. You don\xe2\x80\x99t know what Mademoiselle was in those days, sir; she\r\nwas the sweetest young creature in France, and knew as little of what\r\nwas going on around her as the lamb does of the butcher. I used to\r\nnurse the marquis, and I was always in his room. It was here at\r\nFleuri\xc3\xa8res, in the autumn. We had a doctor from Paris, who came and\r\nstayed two or three weeks in the house. Then there came two others, and\r\nthere was a consultation, and these two others, as I said, declared\r\nthat the marquis couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be saved. After this they went off, pocketing\r\ntheir fees, but the other one stayed and did what he could. The marquis\r\nhimself kept crying out that he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t die, that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to\r\ndie, that he would live and look after his daughter. Mademoiselle\r\nClaire and the viscount\xe2\x80\x94that was Mr. Valentin, you know\xe2\x80\x94were both in\r\nthe house. The doctor was a clever man,\xe2\x80\x94that I could see myself,\xe2\x80\x94and I\r\nthink he believed that the marquis might get well. We took good care of\r\nhim, he and I, between us, and one day, when my lady had almost ordered\r\nher mourning, my patient suddenly began to mend. He got better and\r\nbetter, till the doctor said he was out of danger. What was killing him\r\nwas the dreadful fits of pain in his stomach. But little by little they\r\nstopped, and the poor marquis began to make his jokes again. The doctor\r\nfound something that gave him great comfort\xe2\x80\x94some white stuff that we\r\nkept in a great bottle on the chimney-piece. I used to give it to the\r\nmarquis through a glass tube; it always made him easier. Then the\r\ndoctor went away, after telling me to keep on giving him the mixture\r\nwhenever he was bad. After that there was a little doctor from\r\nPoitiers, who came every day. So we were alone in the house\xe2\x80\x94my lady and\r\nher poor husband and their three children. Young Madame de Bellegarde\r\nhad gone away, with her little girl, to her mothers. You know she is\r\nvery lively, and her maid told me that she didn\xe2\x80\x99t like to be where\r\npeople were dying.\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Bread paused a moment, and then she went on\r\nwith the same quiet consistency. \xe2\x80\x9cI think you have guessed, sir, that\r\nwhen the marquis began to turn my lady was disappointed.\xe2\x80\x9d And she\r\npaused again, bending upon Newman a face which seemed to grow whiter as\r\nthe darkness settled down upon them.\r\n\r\nNewman had listened eagerly\xe2\x80\x94with an eagerness greater even than that\r\nwith which he had bent his ear to Valentin de Bellegarde\xe2\x80\x99s last words.\r\nEvery now and then, as his companion looked up at him, she reminded him\r\nof an ancient tabby cat, protracting the enjoyment of a dish of milk.\r\nEven her triumph was measured and decorous; the faculty of exultation\r\nhad been chilled by disuse. She presently continued. \xe2\x80\x9cLate one night I\r\nwas sitting by the marquis in his room, the great red room in the west\r\ntower. He had been complaining a little, and I gave him a spoonful of\r\nthe doctor\xe2\x80\x99s dose. My lady had been there in the early part of the\r\nevening; she sat far more than an hour by his bed. Then she went away\r\nand left me alone. After midnight she came back, and her eldest son was\r\nwith her. They went to the bed and looked at the marquis, and my lady\r\ntook hold of his hand. Then she turned to me and said he was not so\r\nwell; I remember how the marquis, without saying anything, lay staring\r\nat her. I can see his white face, at this moment, in the great black\r\nsquare between the bed-curtains. I said I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think he was very bad;\r\nand she told me to go to bed\xe2\x80\x94she would sit a while with him. When the\r\nmarquis saw me going he gave a sort of groan, and called out to me not\r\nto leave him; but Mr. Urbain opened the door for me and pointed the way\r\nout. The present marquis\xe2\x80\x94perhaps you have noticed, sir\xe2\x80\x94has a very proud\r\nway of giving orders, and I was there to take orders. I went to my\r\nroom, but I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t easy; I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell you why. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t undress; I\r\nsat there waiting and listening. For what, would you have said, sir? I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have told you; for surely a poor gentleman might be\r\ncomfortable with his wife and his son. It was as if I expected to hear\r\nthe marquis moaning after me again. I listened, but I heard nothing. It\r\nwas a very still night; I never knew a night so still. At last the very\r\nstillness itself seemed to frighten me, and I came out of my room and\r\nwent very softly downstairs. In the anteroom, outside of the marquis\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchamber, I found Mr. Urbain walking up and down. He asked me what I\r\nwanted, and I said I came back to relieve my lady. He said _he_ would\r\nrelieve my lady, and ordered me back to bed; but as I stood there,\r\nunwilling to turn away, the door of the room opened and my lady came\r\nout. I noticed she was very pale; she was very strange. She looked a\r\nmoment at the count and at me, and then she held out her arms to the\r\ncount. He went to her, and she fell upon him and hid her face. I went\r\nquickly past her into the room and to the marquis\xe2\x80\x99s bed. He was lying\r\nthere, very white, with his eyes shut, like a corpse. I took hold of\r\nhis hand and spoke to him, and he felt to me like a dead man. Then I\r\nturned round; my lady and Mr. Urbain were there. \xe2\x80\x98My poor Bread,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nmy lady, \xe2\x80\x98M. le Marquis is gone.\xe2\x80\x99 Mr. Urbain knelt down by the bed and\r\nsaid softly, \xe2\x80\x98_Mon p\xc3\xa8re, mon p\xc3\xa8re_.\xe2\x80\x99 I thought it wonderful strange,\r\nand asked my lady what in the world had happened, and why she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncalled me. She said nothing had happened; that she had only been\r\nsitting there with the marquis, very quiet. She had closed her eyes,\r\nthinking she might sleep, and she had slept, she didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how long.\r\nWhen she woke up he was dead. \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s death, my son, it\xe2\x80\x99s death,\xe2\x80\x99 she\r\nsaid to the count. Mr. Urbain said they must have the doctor,\r\nimmediately, from Poitiers, and that he would ride off and fetch him.\r\nHe kissed his father\xe2\x80\x99s face, and then he kissed his mother and went\r\naway. My lady and I stood there at the bedside. As I looked at the poor\r\nmarquis it came into my head that he was not dead, that he was in a\r\nkind of swoon. And then my lady repeated, \xe2\x80\x98My poor Bread, it\xe2\x80\x99s death,\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s death;\xe2\x80\x99 and I said, \xe2\x80\x98Yes, my lady, it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly death.\xe2\x80\x99 I said\r\njust the opposite to what I believed; it was my notion. Then my lady\r\nsaid we must wait for the doctor, and we sat there and waited. It was a\r\nlong time; the poor marquis neither stirred nor changed. \xe2\x80\x98I have seen\r\ndeath before,\xe2\x80\x99 said my lady, \xe2\x80\x98and it\xe2\x80\x99s terribly like this.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Yes,\r\nplease, my lady,\xe2\x80\x99 said I; and I kept thinking. The night wore away\r\nwithout the count\xe2\x80\x99s coming back, and my lady began to be frightened.\r\nShe was afraid he had had an accident in the dark, or met with some\r\nwild people. At last she got so restless that she went below to watch\r\nin the court for her son\xe2\x80\x99s return. I sat there alone and the marquis\r\nnever stirred.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere Mrs. Bread paused again, and the most artistic of romancers could\r\nnot have been more effective. Newman made a movement as if he were\r\nturning over the page of a novel. \xe2\x80\x9cSo he _was_ dead!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree days afterwards he was in his grave,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bread,\r\nsententiously. \xe2\x80\x9cIn a little while I went away to the front of the house\r\nand looked out into the court, and there, before long, I saw Mr. Urbain\r\nride in alone. I waited a bit, to hear him come upstairs with his\r\nmother, but they stayed below, and I went back to the marquis\xe2\x80\x99s room. I\r\nwent to the bed and held up the light to him, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t let the candlestick fall. The marquis\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were open\xe2\x80\x94open\r\nwide! they were staring at me. I knelt down beside him and took his\r\nhands, and begged him to tell me, in the name of wonder, whether he was\r\nalive or dead. Still he looked at me a long time, and then he made me a\r\nsign to put my ear close to him: \xe2\x80\x98I am dead,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98I am dead. The\r\nmarquise has killed me.\xe2\x80\x99 I was all in a tremble; I didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand\r\nhim. He seemed both a man and a corpse, if you can fancy, sir. \xe2\x80\x98But\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll get well now, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 I said. And then he whispered again, ever so\r\nweak; \xe2\x80\x98I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get well for a kingdom. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be that woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhusband again.\xe2\x80\x99 And then he said more; he said she had murdered him. I\r\nasked him what she had done to him, but he only replied, \xe2\x80\x98Murder,\r\nmurder. And she\xe2\x80\x99ll kill my daughter,\xe2\x80\x99 he said; \xe2\x80\x98my poor unhappy child.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nAnd he begged me to prevent that, and then he said that he was dying,\r\nthat he was dead. I was afraid to move or to leave him; I was almost\r\ndead myself. All of a sudden he asked me to get a pencil and write for\r\nhim; and then I had to tell him that I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t manage a pencil. He\r\nasked me to hold him up in bed while he wrote himself, and I said he\r\ncould never, never do such a thing. But he seemed to have a kind of\r\nterror that gave him strength. I found a pencil in the room and a piece\r\nof paper and a book, and I put the paper on the book and the pencil\r\ninto his hand, and moved the candle near him. You will think all this\r\nvery strange, sir; and very strange it was. The strangest part of it\r\nwas that I believed he was dying, and that I was eager to help him to\r\nwrite. I sat on the bed and put my arm round him, and held him up. I\r\nfelt very strong; I believe I could have lifted him and carried him. It\r\nwas a wonder how he wrote, but he did write, in a big scratching hand;\r\nhe almost covered one side of the paper. It seemed a long time; I\r\nsuppose it was three or four minutes. He was groaning, terribly, all\r\nthe while. Then he said it was ended, and I let him down upon his\r\npillows and he gave me the paper and told me to fold it, and hide it,\r\nand give it to those who would act upon it. \xe2\x80\x98Whom do you mean?\xe2\x80\x99 I said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who are those who will act upon it?\xe2\x80\x99 But he only groaned, for an\r\nanswer; he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t speak, for weakness. In a few minutes he told me to\r\ngo and look at the bottle on the chimney-piece. I knew the bottle he\r\nmeant; the white stuff that was good for his stomach. I went and looked\r\nat it, but it was empty. When I came back his eyes were open and he was\r\nstaring at me; but soon he closed them and he said no more. I hid the\r\npaper in my dress; I didn\xe2\x80\x99t look at what was written upon it, though I\r\ncan read very well, sir, if I haven\xe2\x80\x99t any handwriting. I sat down near\r\nthe bed, but it was nearly half an hour before my lady and the count\r\ncame in. The marquis looked as he did when they left him, and I never\r\nsaid a word about his having been otherwise. Mr. Urbain said that the\r\ndoctor had been called to a person in childbirth, but that he promised\r\nto set out for Fleuri\xc3\xa8res immediately. In another half hour he arrived,\r\nand as soon as he had examined the marquis he said that we had had a\r\nfalse alarm. The poor gentleman was very low, but he was still living.\r\nI watched my lady and her son when he said this, to see if they looked\r\nat each other, and I am obliged to admit that they didn\xe2\x80\x99t. The doctor\r\nsaid there was no reason he should die; he had been going on so well.\r\nAnd then he wanted to know how he had suddenly fallen off; he had left\r\nhim so very hearty. My lady told her little story again\xe2\x80\x94what she had\r\ntold Mr. Urbain and me\xe2\x80\x94and the doctor looked at her and said nothing.\r\nHe stayed all the next day at the ch\xc3\xa2teau, and hardly left the marquis.\r\nI was always there. Mademoiselle and Mr. Valentin came and looked at\r\ntheir father, but he never stirred. It was a strange, deathly stupor.\r\nMy lady was always about; her face was as white as her husband\xe2\x80\x99s, and\r\nshe looked very proud, as I had seen her look when her orders or her\r\nwishes had been disobeyed. It was as if the poor marquis had defied\r\nher; and the way she took it made me afraid of her. The apothecary from\r\nPoitiers kept the marquis along through the day, and we waited for the\r\nother doctor from Paris, who, as I told you, had been staying at\r\nFleuri\xc3\xa8res. They had telegraphed for him early in the morning, and in\r\nthe evening he arrived. He talked a bit outside with the doctor from\r\nPoitiers, and then they came in to see the marquis together. I was with\r\nhim, and so was Mr. Urbain. My lady had been to receive the doctor from\r\nParis, and she didn\xe2\x80\x99t come back with him into the room. He sat down by\r\nthe marquis; I can see him there now, with his hand on the marquis\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwrist, and Mr. Urbain watching him with a little looking-glass in his\r\nhand. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he\xe2\x80\x99s better,\xe2\x80\x99 said the little doctor from Poitiers;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he\xe2\x80\x99ll come back.\xe2\x80\x99 A few moments after he had said this the\r\nmarquis opened his eyes, as if he were waking up, and looked at us,\r\nfrom one to the other. I saw him look at me very softly, as you\xe2\x80\x99d say.\r\nAt the same moment my lady came in on tiptoe; she came up to the bed\r\nand put in her head between me and the count. The marquis saw her and\r\ngave a long, most wonderful moan. He said something we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nunderstand, and he seemed to have a kind of spasm. He shook all over\r\nand then closed his eyes, and the doctor jumped up and took hold of my\r\nlady. He held her for a moment a bit roughly. The marquis was stone\r\ndead! This time there were those there that knew.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman felt as if he had been reading by starlight the report of highly\r\nimportant evidence in a great murder case. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd the paper\xe2\x80\x94the paper!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said, excitedly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat was written upon it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mrs. Bread. \xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t read it; it\r\nwas in French.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut could no one else read it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never asked a human creature.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo one has ever seen it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you see it you\xe2\x80\x99ll be the first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman seized the old woman\xe2\x80\x99s hand in both his own and pressed it\r\nvigorously. \xe2\x80\x9cI thank you ever so much for that,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to\r\nbe the first, I want it to be my property and no one else\xe2\x80\x99s! You\xe2\x80\x99re the\r\nwisest old woman in Europe. And what did you do with the paper?\xe2\x80\x9d This\r\ninformation had made him feel extraordinarily strong. \xe2\x80\x9cGive it to me\r\nquick!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Bread got up with a certain majesty. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not so easy as that,\r\nsir. If you want the paper, you must wait.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut waiting is horrible, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d urged Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sure _I_ have waited; I have waited these many years,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs.\r\nBread.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is very true. You have waited for me. I won\xe2\x80\x99t forget it. And yet,\r\nhow comes it you didn\xe2\x80\x99t do as M. de Bellegarde said, show the paper to\r\nsomeone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo whom should I show it?\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mrs. Bread, mournfully. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was\r\nnot easy to know, and many\xe2\x80\x99s the night I have lain awake thinking of\r\nit. Six months afterwards, when they married Mademoiselle to her\r\nvicious old husband, I was very near bringing it out. I thought it was\r\nmy duty to do something with it, and yet I was mightily afraid. I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t know what was written on the paper or how bad it might be, and\r\nthere was no one I could trust enough to ask. And it seemed to me a\r\ncruel kindness to do that sweet young creature, letting her know that\r\nher father had written her mother down so shamefully; for that\xe2\x80\x99s what\r\nhe did, I suppose. I thought she would rather be unhappy with her\r\nhusband than be unhappy that way. It was for her and for my dear Mr.\r\nValentin I kept quiet. Quiet I call it, but for me it was a weary\r\nquietness. It worried me terribly, and it changed me altogether. But\r\nfor others I held my tongue, and no one, to this hour, knows what\r\npassed between the poor marquis and me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut evidently there were suspicions,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere did Mr.\r\nValentin get his ideas?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was the little doctor from Poitiers. He was very ill-satisfied, and\r\nhe made a great talk. He was a sharp Frenchman, and coming to the\r\nhouse, as he did day after day, I suppose he saw more than he seemed to\r\nsee. And indeed the way the poor marquis went off as soon as his eyes\r\nfell on my lady was a most shocking sight for anyone. The medical\r\ngentleman from Paris was much more accommodating, and he hushed up the\r\nother. But for all he could do Mr. Valentin and Mademoiselle heard\r\nsomething; they knew their father\xe2\x80\x99s death was somehow against nature.\r\nOf course they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t accuse their mother, and, as I tell you, I was\r\nas dumb as that stone. Mr. Valentin used to look at me sometimes, and\r\nhis eyes seemed to shine, as if he were thinking of asking me\r\nsomething. I was dreadfully afraid he would speak, and I always looked\r\naway and went about my business. If I were to tell him, I was sure he\r\nwould hate me afterwards, and that I could never have borne. Once I\r\nwent up to him and took a great liberty; I kissed him, as I had kissed\r\nhim when he was a child. \xe2\x80\x98You oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to look so sad, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 I said;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98believe your poor old Bread. Such a gallant, handsome young man can\r\nhave nothing to be sad about.\xe2\x80\x99 And I think he understood me; he\r\nunderstood that I was begging off, and he made up his mind in his own\r\nway. He went about with his unasked question in his mind, as I did with\r\nmy untold tale; we were both afraid of bringing dishonor on a great\r\nhouse. And it was the same with Mademoiselle. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what\r\nhappened; she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t know. My lady and Mr. Urbain asked me no\r\nquestions because they had no reason. I was as still as a mouse. When I\r\nwas younger my lady thought me a hussy, and now she thought me a fool.\r\nHow should I have any ideas?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you say the little doctor from Poitiers made a talk,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid no one take it up?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heard nothing of it, sir. They are always talking scandal in these\r\nforeign countries you may have noticed\xe2\x80\x94and I suppose they shook their\r\nheads over Madame de Bellegarde. But after all, what could they say?\r\nThe marquis had been ill, and the marquis had died; he had as good a\r\nright to die as anyone. The doctor couldn\xe2\x80\x99t say he had not come\r\nhonestly by his cramps. The next year the little doctor left the place\r\nand bought a practice in Bordeaux, and if there has been any gossip it\r\ndied out. And I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there could have been much gossip about my\r\nlady that anyone would listen to. My lady is so very respectable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman, at this last affirmation, broke into an immense, resounding\r\nlaugh. Mrs. Bread had begun to move away from the spot where they were\r\nsitting, and he helped her through the aperture in the wall and along\r\nthe homeward path. \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cmy lady\xe2\x80\x99s respectability is\r\ndelicious; it will be a great crash!\xe2\x80\x9d They reached the empty space in\r\nfront of the church, where they stopped a moment, looking at each other\r\nwith something of an air of closer fellowship\xe2\x80\x94like two sociable\r\nconspirators. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what was it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat was it she did to\r\nher husband? She didn\xe2\x80\x99t stab him or poison him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know, sir; no one saw it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnless it was Mr. Urbain. You say he was walking up and down, outside\r\nthe room. Perhaps he looked through the keyhole. But no; I think that\r\nwith his mother he would take it on trust.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may be sure I have often thought of it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bread. \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\nsure she didn\xe2\x80\x99t touch him with her hands. I saw nothing on him,\r\nanywhere. I believe it was in this way. He had a fit of his great pain,\r\nand he asked her for his medicine. Instead of giving it to him she went\r\nand poured it away, before his eyes. Then he saw what she meant, and,\r\nweak and helpless as he was, he was frightened, he was terrified. \xe2\x80\x98You\r\nwant to kill me,\xe2\x80\x99 he said. \xe2\x80\x98Yes, M. le Marquis, I want to kill you,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsays my lady, and sits down and fixes her eyes upon him. You know my\r\nlady\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, I think, sir; it was with them she killed him; it was with\r\nthe terrible strong will she put into them. It was like a frost on\r\nflowers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you are a very intelligent woman; you have shown great\r\ndiscretion,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall value your services as housekeeper\r\nextremely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey had begun to descend the hill, and Mrs. Bread said nothing until\r\nthey reached the foot. Newman strolled lightly beside her; his head was\r\nthrown back and he was gazing at all the stars; he seemed to himself to\r\nbe riding his vengeance along the Milky Way. \xe2\x80\x9cSo you are serious, sir,\r\nabout that?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bread, softly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout your living with me? Why of course I will take care of you to\r\nthe end of your days. You can\xe2\x80\x99t live with those people any longer. And\r\nyou oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to, you know, after this. You give me the paper, and you\r\nmove away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems very flighty in me to be taking a new place at this time of\r\nlife,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Mrs. Bread, lugubriously. \xe2\x80\x9cBut if you are going to turn\r\nthe house upside down, I would rather be out of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, in the cheerful tone of a man who feels rich in\r\nalternatives. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I shall bring in the constables, if that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhat you mean. Whatever Madame de Bellegarde did, I am afraid the law\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t take hold of it. But I am glad of that; it leaves it altogether\r\nto me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a mighty bold gentleman, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Mrs. Bread, looking at\r\nhim round the edge of her great bonnet.\r\n\r\nHe walked with her back to the ch\xc3\xa2teau; the curfew had tolled for the\r\nlaborious villagers of Fleuri\xc3\xa8res, and the street was unlighted and\r\nempty. She promised him that he should have the marquis\xe2\x80\x99s manuscript in\r\nhalf an hour. Mrs. Bread choosing not to go in by the great gate, they\r\npassed round by a winding lane to a door in the wall of the park, of\r\nwhich she had the key, and which would enable her to enter the ch\xc3\xa2teau\r\nfrom behind. Newman arranged with her that he should await outside the\r\nwall her return with the coveted document.\r\n\r\nShe went in, and his half hour in the dusky lane seemed very long. But\r\nhe had plenty to think about. At last the door in the wall opened and\r\nMrs. Bread stood there, with one hand on the latch and the other\r\nholding out a scrap of white paper, folded small. In a moment he was\r\nmaster of it, and it had passed into his waistcoat pocket. \xe2\x80\x9cCome and\r\nsee me in Paris,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cwe are to settle your future, you know; and\r\nI will translate poor M. de Bellegarde\xe2\x80\x99s French to you.\xe2\x80\x9d Never had he\r\nfelt so grateful as at this moment for M. Nioche\xe2\x80\x99s instructions.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bread\xe2\x80\x99s dull eyes had followed the disappearance of the paper, and\r\nshe gave a heavy sigh. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, you have done what you would with me,\r\nsir, and I suppose you will do it again. You _must_ take care of me\r\nnow. You are a terribly positive gentleman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a terribly impatient gentleman!\xe2\x80\x9d And he\r\nbade her good-night and walked rapidly back to the inn. He ordered his\r\nvehicle to be prepared for his return to Poitiers, and then he shut the\r\ndoor of the common salle and strode toward the solitary lamp on the\r\nchimney-piece. He pulled out the paper and quickly unfolded it. It was\r\ncovered with pencil-marks, which at first, in the feeble light, seemed\r\nindistinct. But Newman\xe2\x80\x99s fierce curiosity forced a meaning from the\r\ntremulous signs. The English of them was as follows:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy wife has tried to kill me, and she has done it; I am dying, dying\r\nhorribly. It is to marry my dear daughter to M. de Cintr\xc3\xa9. With all my\r\nsoul I protest,\xe2\x80\x94I forbid it. I am not insane,\xe2\x80\x94ask the doctors, ask Mrs.\r\nB\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94. It was alone with me here, to-night; she attacked me and put me to\r\ndeath. It is murder, if murder ever was. Ask the doctors.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHENRI-URBAIN DE BELLEGARDE\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\n\r\nNewman returned to Paris the second day after his interview with Mrs.\r\nBread. The morrow he had spent at Poitiers, reading over and over again\r\nthe little document which he had lodged in his pocket-book, and\r\nthinking what he would do in the circumstances and how he would do it.\r\nHe would not have said that Poitiers was an amusing place; yet the day\r\nseemed very short. Domiciled once more in the Boulevard Haussmann, he\r\nwalked over to the Rue de l\xe2\x80\x99Universit\xc3\xa9 and inquired of Madame de\r\nBellegarde\xe2\x80\x99s portress whether the marquise had come back. The portress\r\ntold him that she had arrived, with M. le Marquis, on the preceding\r\nday, and further informed him that if he desired to enter, Madame de\r\nBellegarde and her son were both at home. As she said these words the\r\nlittle white-faced old woman who peered out of the dusky gate-house of\r\nthe H\xc3\xb4tel de Bellegarde gave a small wicked smile\xe2\x80\x94a smile which seemed\r\nto Newman to mean, \xe2\x80\x9cGo in if you dare!\xe2\x80\x9d She was evidently versed in the\r\ncurrent domestic history; she was placed where she could feel the pulse\r\nof the house. Newman stood a moment, twisting his moustache and looking\r\nat her; then he abruptly turned away. But this was not because he was\r\nafraid to go in\xe2\x80\x94though he doubted whether, if he did so, he should be\r\nable to make his way, unchallenged, into the presence of Madame de\r\nCintr\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s relatives. Confidence\xe2\x80\x94excessive confidence, perhaps\xe2\x80\x94quite as\r\nmuch as timidity prompted his retreat. He was nursing his thunderbolt;\r\nhe loved it; he was unwilling to part with it. He seemed to be holding\r\nit aloft in the rumbling, vaguely-flashing air, directly over the heads\r\nof his victims, and he fancied he could see their pale, upturned faces.\r\nFew specimens of the human countenance had ever given him such pleasure\r\nas these, lighted in the lurid fashion I have hinted at, and he was\r\ndisposed to sip the cup of contemplative revenge in a leisurely\r\nfashion. It must be added, too, that he was at a loss to see exactly\r\nhow he could arrange to witness the operation of his thunder. To send\r\nin his card to Madame de Bellegarde would be a waste of ceremony; she\r\nwould certainly decline to receive him. On the other hand he could not\r\nforce his way into her presence. It annoyed him keenly to think that he\r\nmight be reduced to the blind satisfaction of writing her a letter; but\r\nhe consoled himself in a measure with the reflection that a letter\r\nmight lead to an interview. He went home, and feeling rather\r\ntired\xe2\x80\x94nursing a vengeance was, it must be confessed, a rather fatiguing\r\nprocess; it took a good deal out of one\xe2\x80\x94flung himself into one of his\r\nbrocaded fauteuils, stretched his legs, thrust his hands into his\r\npockets, and, while he watched the reflected sunset fading from the\r\nornate house-tops on the opposite side of the Boulevard, began mentally\r\nto compose a cool epistle to Madame de Bellegarde. While he was so\r\noccupied his servant threw open the door and announced ceremoniously,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadame Brett!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman roused himself, expectantly, and in a few moments perceived upon\r\nhis threshold the worthy woman with whom he had conversed to such good\r\npurpose on the starlit hill-top of Fleuri\xc3\xa8res. Mrs. Bread had made for\r\nthis visit the same toilet as for her former expedition. Newman was\r\nstruck with her distinguished appearance. His lamp was not lit, and as\r\nher large, grave face gazed at him through the light dusk from under\r\nthe shadow of her ample bonnet, he felt the incongruity of such a\r\nperson presenting herself as a servant. He greeted her with high\r\ngeniality and bade her come in and sit down and make herself\r\ncomfortable. There was something which might have touched the springs\r\nboth of mirth and of melancholy in the ancient maidenliness with which\r\nMrs. Bread endeavored to comply with these directions. She was not\r\nplaying at being fluttered, which would have been simply ridiculous;\r\nshe was doing her best to carry herself as a person so humble that, for\r\nher, even embarrassment would have been pretentious; but evidently she\r\nhad never dreamed of its being in her horoscope to pay a visit, at\r\nnight-fall, to a friendly single gentleman who lived in\r\ntheatrical-looking rooms on one of the new Boulevards.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI truly hope I am not forgetting my place, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForgetting your place?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you are remembering it.\r\nThis is your place, you know. You are already in my service; your\r\nwages, as housekeeper, began a fortnight ago. I can tell you my house\r\nwants keeping! Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you take off your bonnet and stay?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake off my bonnet?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bread, with timid literalness. \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\r\nsir, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t my cap. And with your leave, sir, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t keep house\r\nin my best gown.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind your gown,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, cheerfully. \xe2\x80\x9cYou shall have a\r\nbetter gown than that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Bread stared solemnly and then stretched her hands over her\r\nlustreless satin skirt, as if the perilous side of her situation were\r\ndefining itself. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, sir, I am fond of my own clothes,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope you have left those wicked people, at any rate,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, sir, here I am!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bread. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all I can tell you.\r\nHere I sit, poor Catherine Bread. It\xe2\x80\x99s a strange place for me to be. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know myself; I never supposed I was so bold. But indeed, sir, I\r\nhave gone as far as my own strength will bear me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, come, Mrs. Bread,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, almost caressingly, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t make\r\nyourself uncomfortable. Now\xe2\x80\x99s the time to feel lively, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe began to speak again with a trembling voice. \xe2\x80\x9cI think it would be\r\nmore respectable if I could\xe2\x80\x94if I could\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and her voice trembled to a\r\npause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you could give up this sort of thing altogether?\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman\r\nkindly, trying to anticipate her meaning, which he supposed might be a\r\nwish to retire from service.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I could give up everything, sir! All I should ask is a decent\r\nProtestant burial.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBurial!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Newman, with a burst of laughter. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, to bury you now\r\nwould be a sad piece of extravagance. It\xe2\x80\x99s only rascals who have to be\r\nburied to get respectable. Honest folks like you and me can live our\r\ntime out\xe2\x80\x94and live together. Come! Did you bring your baggage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy box is locked and corded; but I haven\xe2\x80\x99t yet spoken to my lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak to her, then, and have done with it. I should like to have your\r\nchance!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would gladly give it you, sir. I have passed some weary hours in my\r\nlady\xe2\x80\x99s dressing-room; but this will be one of the longest. She will tax\r\nme with ingratitude.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, \xe2\x80\x9cso long as you can tax her with murder\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, sir, I can\xe2\x80\x99t; not I,\xe2\x80\x9d sighed Mrs. Bread.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to say anything about it? So much the better. Leave\r\nthat to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf she calls me a thankless old woman,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bread, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall have\r\nnothing to say. But it is better so,\xe2\x80\x9d she softly added. \xe2\x80\x9cShe shall be\r\nmy lady to the last. That will be more respectable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then you will come to me and I shall be your gentleman,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nNewman; \xe2\x80\x9cthat will be more respectable still!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Bread rose, with lowered eyes, and stood a moment; then, looking\r\nup, she rested her eyes upon Newman\xe2\x80\x99s face. The disordered proprieties\r\nwere somehow settling to rest. She looked at Newman so long and so\r\nfixedly, with such a dull, intense devotedness, that he himself might\r\nhave had a pretext for embarrassment. At last she said gently, \xe2\x80\x9cYou are\r\nnot looking well, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s natural enough,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cI have nothing to feel well\r\nabout. To be very indifferent and very fierce, very dull and very\r\njovial, very sick and very lively, all at once,\xe2\x80\x94why, it rather mixes\r\none up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Bread gave a noiseless sigh. \xe2\x80\x9cI can tell you something that will\r\nmake you feel duller still, if you want to feel all one way. About\r\nMadame de Cintr\xc3\xa9.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can you tell me?\xe2\x80\x9d Newman demanded. \xe2\x80\x9cNot that you have seen her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe shook her head. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, indeed, sir, nor ever shall. That\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\ndullness of it. Nor my lady. Nor M. de Bellegarde.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean that she is kept so close.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClose, close,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bread, very softly.\r\n\r\nThese words, for an instant, seemed to check the beating of Newman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nheart. He leaned back in his chair, staring up at the old woman. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\r\nhave tried to see her, and she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe refused\xe2\x80\x94forever! I had it from my lady\xe2\x80\x99s own maid,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs.\r\nBread, \xe2\x80\x9cwho had it from my lady. To speak of it to such a person my\r\nlady must have felt the shock. Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 won\xe2\x80\x99t see them now, and\r\nnow is her only chance. A while hence she will have no chance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean the other women\xe2\x80\x94the mothers, the daughters, the sisters; what\r\nis it they call them?\xe2\x80\x94won\xe2\x80\x99t let her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is what they call the rule of the house,\xe2\x80\x94or of the order, I\r\nbelieve,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bread. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no rule so strict as that of the\r\nCarmelites. The bad women in the reformatories are fine ladies to them.\r\nThey wear old brown cloaks\xe2\x80\x94so the _femme de chambre_ told me\xe2\x80\x94that you\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t use for a horse blanket. And the poor countess was so fond of\r\nsoft-feeling dresses; she would never have anything stiff! They sleep\r\non the ground,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Bread went on; \xe2\x80\x9cthey are no better, no\r\nbetter,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and she hesitated for a comparison,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthey are no better than\r\ntinkers\xe2\x80\x99 wives. They give up everything, down to the very name their\r\npoor old nurses called them by. They give up father and mother, brother\r\nand sister,\xe2\x80\x94to say nothing of other persons,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Bread delicately\r\nadded. \xe2\x80\x9cThey wear a shroud under their brown cloaks and a rope round\r\ntheir waists, and they get up on winter nights and go off into cold\r\nplaces to pray to the Virgin Mary. The Virgin Mary is a hard mistress!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Bread, dwelling on these terrible facts, sat dry-eyed and pale,\r\nwith her hands clasped in her satin lap. Newman gave a melancholy groan\r\nand fell forward, leaning his head on his hands. There was a long\r\nsilence, broken only by the ticking of the great gilded clock on the\r\nchimney-piece.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is this place\xe2\x80\x94where is the convent?\xe2\x80\x9d Newman asked at last,\r\nlooking up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are two houses,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bread. \xe2\x80\x9cI found out; I thought you\r\nwould like to know\xe2\x80\x94though it\xe2\x80\x99s poor comfort, I think. One is in the\r\nAvenue de Messine; they have learned that Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 is there.\r\nThe other is in the Rue d\xe2\x80\x99Enfer. That\xe2\x80\x99s a terrible name; I suppose you\r\nknow what it means.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman got up and walked away to the end of his long room. When he came\r\nback Mrs. Bread had got up, and stood by the fire with folded hands.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me this,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cCan I get near her\xe2\x80\x94even if I don\xe2\x80\x99t see her?\r\nCan I look through a grating, or some such thing, at the place where\r\nshe is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt is said that all women love a lover, and Mrs. Bread\xe2\x80\x99s sense of the\r\npre-established harmony which kept servants in their \xe2\x80\x9cplace,\xe2\x80\x9d even as\r\nplanets in their orbits (not that Mrs. Bread had ever consciously\r\nlikened herself to a planet), barely availed to temper the maternal\r\nmelancholy with which she leaned her head on one side and gazed at her\r\nnew employer. She probably felt for the moment as if, forty years\r\nbefore, she had held him also in her arms. \xe2\x80\x9cThat wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t help you,\r\nsir. It would only make her seem farther away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to go there, at all events,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cAvenue de Messine,\r\nyou say? And what is it they call themselves?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCarmelites,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bread.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall remember that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Bread hesitated a moment, and then, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s my duty to tell you\r\nthis, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on. \xe2\x80\x9cThe convent has a chapel, and some people are\r\nadmitted on Sunday to the mass. You don\xe2\x80\x99t see the poor creatures that\r\nare shut up there, but I am told you can hear them sing. It\xe2\x80\x99s a wonder\r\nthey have any heart for singing! Some Sunday I shall make bold to go.\r\nIt seems to me I should know _her_ voice in fifty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman looked at his visitor very gratefully; then he held out his hand\r\nand shook hers. \xe2\x80\x9cThank you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf anyone can get in, I will.\xe2\x80\x9d A\r\nmoment later Mrs. Bread proposed, deferentially, to retire, but he\r\nchecked her and put a lighted candle into her hand. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are half a\r\ndozen rooms there I don\xe2\x80\x99t use,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, pointing through an open door.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo and look at them and take your choice. You can live in the one you\r\nlike best.\xe2\x80\x9d From this bewildering opportunity Mrs. Bread at first\r\nrecoiled; but finally, yielding to Newman\xe2\x80\x99s gentle, reassuring push,\r\nshe wandered off into the dusk with her tremulous taper. She remained\r\nabsent a quarter of an hour, during which Newman paced up and down,\r\nstopped occasionally to look out of the window at the lights on the\r\nBoulevard, and then resumed his walk. Mrs. Bread\xe2\x80\x99s relish for her\r\ninvestigation apparently increased as she proceeded; but at last she\r\nreappeared and deposited her candlestick on the chimney-piece.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, have you picked one out?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA room, sir? They are all too fine for a dingy old body like me. There\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t one that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t a bit of gilding.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s only tinsel, Mrs. Bread,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you stay there a while\r\nit will all peel off of itself.\xe2\x80\x9d And he gave a dismal smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, sir, there are things enough peeling off already!\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Mrs.\r\nBread, with a head-shake. \xe2\x80\x9cSince I was there I thought I would look\r\nabout me. I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe you know, sir. The corners are most dreadful.\r\nYou do want a housekeeper, that you do; you want a tidy Englishwoman\r\nthat isn\xe2\x80\x99t above taking hold of a broom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman assured her that he suspected, if he had not measured, his\r\ndomestic abuses, and that to reform them was a mission worthy of her\r\npowers. She held her candlestick aloft again and looked around the\r\nsalon with compassionate glances; then she intimated that she accepted\r\nthe mission, and that its sacred character would sustain her in her\r\nrupture with Madame de Bellegarde. With this she curtsied herself away.\r\n\r\nShe came back the next day with her worldly goods, and Newman, going\r\ninto his drawing-room, found her upon her aged knees before a divan,\r\nsewing up some detached fringe. He questioned her as to her\r\nleave-taking with her late mistress, and she said it had proved easier\r\nthan she feared. \xe2\x80\x9cI was perfectly civil, sir, but the Lord helped me to\r\nremember that a good woman has no call to tremble before a bad one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think so!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd does she know you have come to\r\nme?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe asked me where I was going, and I mentioned your name,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs.\r\nBread.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did she say to that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe looked at me very hard, and she turned very red. Then she bade me\r\nleave her. I was all ready to go, and I had got the coachman, who is an\r\nEnglishman, to bring down my poor box and to fetch me a cab. But when I\r\nwent down myself to the gate I found it closed. My lady had sent orders\r\nto the porter not to let me pass, and by the same orders the porter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwife\xe2\x80\x94she is a dreadful sly old body\xe2\x80\x94had gone out in a cab to fetch home\r\nM. de Bellegarde from his club.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman slapped his knee. \xe2\x80\x9cShe _is_ scared! she _is_ scared!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried,\r\nexultantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was frightened too, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bread, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I was also mightily\r\nvexed. I took it very high with the porter and asked him by what right\r\nhe used violence to an honorable Englishwoman who had lived in the\r\nhouse for thirty years before he was heard of. Oh, sir, I was very\r\ngrand, and I brought the man down. He drew his bolts and let me out,\r\nand I promised the cabman something handsome if he would drive fast.\r\nBut he was terribly slow; it seemed as if we should never reach your\r\nblessed door. I am all of a tremble still; it took me five minutes,\r\njust now, to thread my needle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman told her, with a gleeful laugh, that if she chose she might have\r\na little maid on purpose to thread her needles; and he went away\r\nmurmuring to himself again that the old woman _was_ scared\xe2\x80\x94she _was_\r\nscared!\r\n\r\nHe had not shown Mrs. Tristram the little paper that he carried in his\r\npocket-book, but since his return to Paris he had seen her several\r\ntimes, and she had told him that he seemed to her to be in a strange\r\nway\xe2\x80\x94an even stranger way than his sad situation made natural. Had his\r\ndisappointment gone to his head? He looked like a man who was going to\r\nbe ill, and yet she had never seen him more restless and active. One\r\nday he would sit hanging his head and looking as if he were firmly\r\nresolved never to smile again; another he would indulge in laughter\r\nthat was almost unseemly and make jokes that were bad even for him. If\r\nhe was trying to carry off his sorrow, he at such times really went too\r\nfar. She begged him of all things not to be \xe2\x80\x9cstrange.\xe2\x80\x9d Feeling in a\r\nmeasure responsible as she did for the affair which had turned out so\r\nill for him, she could endure anything but his strangeness. He might be\r\nmelancholy if he would, or he might be stoical; he might be cross and\r\ncantankerous with her and ask her why she had ever dared to meddle with\r\nhis destiny: to this she would submit; for this she would make\r\nallowances. Only, for Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake, let him not be incoherent. That\r\nwould be extremely unpleasant. It was like people talking in their\r\nsleep; they always frightened her. And Mrs. Tristram intimated that,\r\ntaking very high ground as regards the moral obligation which events\r\nhad laid upon her, she proposed not to rest quiet until she should have\r\nconfronted him with the least inadequate substitute for Madame de\r\nCintr\xc3\xa9 that the two hemispheres contained.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, \xe2\x80\x9cwe are even now, and we had better not open a new\r\naccount! You may bury me some day, but you shall never marry me. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntoo rough. I hope, at any rate,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9cthat there is nothing\r\nincoherent in this\xe2\x80\x94that I want to go next Sunday to the Carmelite\r\nchapel in the Avenue de Messine. You know one of the Catholic\r\nministers\xe2\x80\x94an abb\xc3\xa9, is that it?\xe2\x80\x94I have seen him here, you know; that\r\nmotherly old gentleman with the big waistband. Please ask him if I need\r\na special leave to go in, and if I do, beg him to obtain it for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Tristram gave expression to the liveliest joy. \xe2\x80\x9cI am so glad you\r\nhave asked me to do something!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cYou shall get into the\r\nchapel if the abb\xc3\xa9 is disfrocked for his share in it.\xe2\x80\x9d And two days\r\nafterwards she told him that it was all arranged; the abb\xc3\xa9 was\r\nenchanted to serve him, and if he would present himself civilly at the\r\nconvent gate there would be no difficulty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\n\r\nSunday was as yet two days off; but meanwhile, to beguile his\r\nimpatience, Newman took his way to the Avenue de Messine and got what\r\ncomfort he could in staring at the blank outer wall of Madame de\r\nCintr\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s present residence. The street in question, as some travelers\r\nwill remember, adjoins the Parc Monceau, which is one of the prettiest\r\ncorners of Paris. The quarter has an air of modern opulence and\r\nconvenience which seems at variance with the ascetic institution, and\r\nthe impression made upon Newman\xe2\x80\x99s gloomily-irritated gaze by the\r\nfresh-looking, windowless expanse behind which the woman he loved was\r\nperhaps even then pledging herself to pass the rest of her days was\r\nless exasperating than he had feared. The place suggested a convent\r\nwith the modern improvements\xe2\x80\x94an asylum in which privacy, though\r\nunbroken, might be not quite identical with privation, and meditation,\r\nthough monotonous, might be of a cheerful cast. And yet he knew the\r\ncase was otherwise; only at present it was not a reality to him. It was\r\ntoo strange and too mocking to be real; it was like a page torn out of\r\na romance, with no context in his own experience.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday morning, at the hour which Mrs. Tristram had indicated, he\r\nrang at the gate in the blank wall. It instantly opened and admitted\r\nhim into a clean, cold-looking court, from beyond which a dull, plain\r\nedifice looked down upon him. A robust lay sister with a cheerful\r\ncomplexion emerged from a porter\xe2\x80\x99s lodge, and, on his stating his\r\nerrand, pointed to the open door of the chapel, an edifice which\r\noccupied the right side of the court and was preceded by the high\r\nflight of steps. Newman ascended the steps and immediately entered the\r\nopen door. Service had not yet begun; the place was dimly lighted, and\r\nit was some moments before he could distinguish its features. Then he\r\nsaw it was divided by a large close iron screen into two unequal\r\nportions. The altar was on the hither side of the screen, and between\r\nit and the entrance were disposed several benches and chairs. Three or\r\nfour of these were occupied by vague, motionless figures\xe2\x80\x94figures that\r\nhe presently perceived to be women, deeply absorbed in their devotion.\r\nThe place seemed to Newman very cold; the smell of the incense itself\r\nwas cold. Besides this there was a twinkle of tapers and here and there\r\na glow of colored glass. Newman seated himself; the praying women kept\r\nstill, with their backs turned. He saw they were visitors like himself\r\nand he would have liked to see their faces; for he believed that they\r\nwere the mourning mothers and sisters of other women who had had the\r\nsame pitiless courage as Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9. But they were better off\r\nthan he, for they at least shared the faith to which the others had\r\nsacrificed themselves. Three or four persons came in; two of them were\r\nelderly gentlemen. Everyone was very quiet. Newman fastened his eyes\r\nupon the screen behind the altar. That was the convent, the real\r\nconvent, the place where she was. But he could see nothing; no light\r\ncame through the crevices. He got up and approached the partition very\r\ngently, trying to look through. But behind it there was darkness, with\r\nnothing stirring. He went back to his place, and after that a priest\r\nand two altar boys came in and began to say mass.\r\n\r\nNewman watched their genuflections and gyrations with a grim, still\r\nenmity; they seemed aids and abettors of Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s desertion;\r\nthey were mouthing and droning out their triumph. The priest\xe2\x80\x99s long,\r\ndismal intonings acted upon his nerves and deepened his wrath; there\r\nwas something defiant in his unintelligible drawl; it seemed meant for\r\nNewman himself. Suddenly there arose from the depths of the chapel,\r\nfrom behind the inexorable grating, a sound which drew his attention\r\nfrom the altar\xe2\x80\x94the sound of a strange, lugubrious chant, uttered by\r\nwomen\xe2\x80\x99s voices. It began softly, but it presently grew louder, and as\r\nit increased it became more of a wail and a dirge. It was the chant of\r\nthe Carmelite nuns, their only human utterance. It was their dirge over\r\ntheir buried affections and over the vanity of earthly desires. At\r\nfirst Newman was bewildered\xe2\x80\x94almost stunned\xe2\x80\x94by the strangeness of the\r\nsound; then, as he comprehended its meaning, he listened intently and\r\nhis heart began to throb. He listened for Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s voice, and\r\nin the very heart of the tuneless harmony he imagined he made it out.\r\n(We are obliged to believe that he was wrong, inasmuch as she had\r\nobviously not yet had time to become a member of the invisible\r\nsisterhood.) The chant kept on, mechanical and monotonous, with dismal\r\nrepetitions and despairing cadences. It was hideous, it was horrible;\r\nas it continued, Newman felt that he needed all his self-control. He\r\nwas growing more agitated; he felt tears in his eyes. At last, as in\r\nits full force the thought came over him that this confused, impersonal\r\nwail was all that either he or the world she had deserted should ever\r\nhear of the voice he had found so sweet, he felt that he could bear it\r\nno longer. He rose abruptly and made his way out. On the threshold he\r\npaused, listened again to the dreary strain, and then hastily descended\r\ninto the court. As he did so he saw the good sister with the\r\nhigh-colored cheeks and the fanlike frill to her coiffure, who had\r\nadmitted him, was in conference at the gate with two persons who had\r\njust come in. A second glance informed him that these persons were\r\nMadame de Bellegarde and her son, and that they were about to avail\r\nthemselves of that method of approach to Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 which Newman\r\nhad found but a mockery of consolation. As he crossed the court M. de\r\nBellegarde recognized him; the marquis was coming to the steps, leading\r\nhis mother. The old lady also gave Newman a look, and it resembled that\r\nof her son. Both faces expressed a franker perturbation, something more\r\nakin to the humbleness of dismay, than Newman had yet seen in them.\r\nEvidently he startled the Bellegardes, and they had not their grand\r\nbehavior immediately in hand. Newman hurried past them, guided only by\r\nthe desire to get out of the convent walls and into the street. The\r\ngate opened itself at his approach; he strode over the threshold and it\r\nclosed behind him. A carriage which appeared to have been standing\r\nthere, was just turning away from the sidewalk. Newman looked at it for\r\na moment, blankly; then he became conscious, through the dusky mist\r\nthat swam before his eyes, that a lady seated in it was bowing to him.\r\nThe vehicle had turned away before he recognized her; it was an ancient\r\nlandau with one half the cover lowered. The lady\xe2\x80\x99s bow was very\r\npositive and accompanied with a smile; a little girl was seated beside\r\nher. He raised his hat, and then the lady bade the coachman stop. The\r\ncarriage halted again beside the pavement, and she sat there and\r\nbeckoned to Newman\xe2\x80\x94beckoned with the demonstrative grace of Madame\r\nUrbain de Bellegarde. Newman hesitated a moment before he obeyed her\r\nsummons, during this moment he had time to curse his stupidity for\r\nletting the others escape him. He had been wondering how he could get\r\nat them; fool that he was for not stopping them then and there! What\r\nbetter place than beneath the very prison walls to which they had\r\nconsigned the promise of his joy? He had been too bewildered to stop\r\nthem, but now he felt ready to wait for them at the gate. Madame\r\nUrbain, with a certain attractive petulance, beckoned to him again, and\r\nthis time he went over to the carriage. She leaned out and gave him her\r\nhand, looking at him kindly, and smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou don\xe2\x80\x99t include me in your wrath? I had\r\nnothing to do with it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose _you_ could have prevented it!\xe2\x80\x9d Newman answered in\r\na tone which was not that of studied gallantry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat you say is too true for me to resent the small account it makes\r\nof my influence. I forgive you, at any rate, because you look as if you\r\nhad seen a ghost.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have!\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad, then, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t go in with Madame de Bellegarde and my\r\nhusband. You must have seen them, eh? Was the meeting affectionate? Did\r\nyou hear the chanting? They say it\xe2\x80\x99s like the lamentations of the\r\ndamned. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go in: one is certain to hear that soon enough. Poor\r\nClaire\xe2\x80\x94in a white shroud and a big brown cloak! That\xe2\x80\x99s the _toilette_\r\nof the Carmelites, you know. Well, she was always fond of long, loose\r\nthings. But I must not speak of her to you; only I must say that I am\r\nvery sorry for you, that if I could have helped you I would, and that I\r\nthink everyone has been very shabby. I was afraid of it, you know; I\r\nfelt it in the air for a fortnight before it came. When I saw you at my\r\nmother-in-law\xe2\x80\x99s ball, taking it all so easily, I felt as if you were\r\ndancing on your grave. But what could I do? I wish you all the good I\r\ncan think of. You will say that isn\xe2\x80\x99t much! Yes; they have been very\r\nshabby; I am not a bit afraid to say it; I assure you everyone thinks\r\nso. We are not all like that. I am sorry I am not going to see you\r\nagain; you know I think you very good company. I would prove it by\r\nasking you to get into the carriage and drive with me for a quarter of\r\nan hour, while I wait for my mother-in-law. Only if we were\r\nseen\xe2\x80\x94considering what has passed, and everyone knows you have been\r\nturned away\xe2\x80\x94it might be thought I was going a little too far, even for\r\nme. But I shall see you sometimes\xe2\x80\x94somewhere, eh? You know\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94this was\r\nsaid in English\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwe have a plan for a little amusement.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman stood there with his hand on the carriage-door listening to this\r\nconsolatory murmur with an unlighted eye. He hardly knew what Madame de\r\nBellegarde was saying; he was only conscious that she was chattering\r\nineffectively. But suddenly it occurred to him that, with her pretty\r\nprofessions, there was a way of making her effective; she might help\r\nhim to get at the old woman and the marquis. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are coming back\r\nsoon\xe2\x80\x94your companions?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are waiting for them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey will hear the mass out; there is nothing to keep them longer.\r\nClaire has refused to see them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to speak to them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman; \xe2\x80\x9cand you can help me, you can\r\ndo me a favor. Delay your return for five minutes and give me a chance\r\nat them. I will wait for them here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame de Bellegarde clasped her hands with a tender grimace. \xe2\x80\x9cMy poor\r\nfriend, what do you want to do to them? To beg them to come back to\r\nyou? It will be wasted words. They will never come back!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to speak to them, all the same. Pray do what I ask you. Stay\r\naway and leave them to me for five minutes; you needn\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid; I\r\nshall not be violent; I am very quiet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you look very quiet! If they had _le c\xc5\x93ur tendre_ you would move\r\nthem. But they haven\xe2\x80\x99t! However, I will do better for you than what you\r\npropose. The understanding is not that I shall come back for them. I am\r\ngoing into the Parc Monceau with my little girl to give her a walk, and\r\nmy mother-in-law, who comes so rarely into this quarter, is to profit\r\nby the same opportunity to take the air. We are to wait for her in the\r\npark, where my husband is to bring her to us. Follow me now; just\r\nwithin the gates I shall get out of my carriage. Sit down on a chair in\r\nsome quiet corner and I will bring them near you. There\xe2\x80\x99s devotion for\r\nyou! _Le reste vous regarde_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis proposal seemed to Newman extremely felicitous; it revived his\r\ndrooping spirit, and he reflected that Madame Urbain was not such a\r\ngoose as she seemed. He promised immediately to overtake her, and the\r\ncarriage drove away.\r\n\r\nThe Parc Monceau is a very pretty piece of landscape-gardening, but\r\nNewman, passing into it, bestowed little attention upon its elegant\r\nvegetation, which was full of the freshness of spring. He found Madame\r\nde Bellegarde promptly, seated in one of the quiet corners of which she\r\nhad spoken, while before her, in the alley, her little girl, attended\r\nby the footman and the lap-dog, walked up and down as if she were\r\ntaking a lesson in deportment. Newman sat down beside the mamma, and\r\nshe talked a great deal, apparently with the design of convincing him\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x94if he would only see it\xe2\x80\x94poor dear Claire did not belong to the\r\nmost fascinating type of woman. She was too tall and thin, too stiff\r\nand cold; her mouth was too wide and her nose too narrow. She had no\r\ndimples anywhere. And then she was eccentric, eccentric in cold blood;\r\nshe was an Anglaise, after all. Newman was very impatient; he was\r\ncounting the minutes until his victims should reappear. He sat silent,\r\nleaning upon his cane, looking absently and insensibly at the little\r\nmarquise. At length Madame de Bellegarde said she would walk toward the\r\ngate of the park and meet her companions; but before she went she\r\ndropped her eyes, and, after playing a moment with the lace of her\r\nsleeve, looked up again at Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you remember,\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, \xe2\x80\x9cthe promise you made me three weeks\r\nago?\xe2\x80\x9d And then, as Newman, vainly consulting his memory, was obliged to\r\nconfess that the promise had escaped it, she declared that he had made\r\nher, at the time, a very queer answer\xe2\x80\x94an answer at which, viewing it in\r\nthe light of the sequel, she had fair ground for taking offense. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\npromised to take me to Bullier\xe2\x80\x99s after your marriage. After your\r\nmarriage\xe2\x80\x94you made a great point of that. Three days after that your\r\nmarriage was broken off. Do you know, when I heard the news, the first\r\nthing I said to myself? \xe2\x80\x98Oh heaven, now he won\xe2\x80\x99t go with me to\r\nBullier\xe2\x80\x99s!\xe2\x80\x99 And I really began to wonder if you had not been expecting\r\nthe rupture.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my dear lady,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Newman, looking down the path to see if\r\nthe others were not coming.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall be good-natured,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de Bellegarde. \xe2\x80\x9cOne must not ask\r\ntoo much of a gentleman who is in love with a cloistered nun. Besides,\r\nI can\xe2\x80\x99t go to Bullier\xe2\x80\x99s while we are in mourning. But I haven\xe2\x80\x99t given\r\nit up for that. The _partie_ is arranged; I have my cavalier. Lord\r\nDeepmere, if you please! He has gone back to his dear Dublin; but a few\r\nmonths hence I am to name any evening and he will come over from\r\nIreland, on purpose. That\xe2\x80\x99s what I call gallantry!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShortly after this Madame de Bellegarde walked away with her little\r\ngirl. Newman sat in his place; the time seemed terribly long. He felt\r\nhow fiercely his quarter of an hour in the convent chapel had raked\r\nover the glowing coals of his resentment. Madame de Bellegarde kept him\r\nwaiting, but she proved as good as her word. At last she reappeared at\r\nthe end of the path, with her little girl and her footman; beside her\r\nslowly walked her husband, with his mother on his arm. They were a long\r\ntime advancing, during which Newman sat unmoved. Tingling as he was\r\nwith passion, it was extremely characteristic of him that he was able\r\nto moderate his expression of it, as he would have turned down a\r\nflaring gas-burner. His native coolness, shrewdness, and\r\ndeliberateness, his life-long submissiveness to the sentiment that\r\nwords were acts and acts were steps in life, and that in this matter of\r\ntaking steps curveting and prancing were exclusively reserved for\r\nquadrupeds and foreigners\xe2\x80\x94all this admonished him that rightful wrath\r\nhad no connection with being a fool and indulging in spectacular\r\nviolence. So as he rose, when old Madame de Bellegarde and her son were\r\nclose to him, he only felt very tall and light. He had been sitting\r\nbeside some shrubbery, in such a way as not to be noticeable at a\r\ndistance; but M. de Bellegarde had evidently already perceived him. His\r\nmother and he were holding their course, but Newman stepped in front of\r\nthem, and they were obliged to pause. He lifted his hat slightly, and\r\nlooked at them for a moment; they were pale with amazement and disgust.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me for stopping you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in a low tone, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I must profit\r\nby the occasion. I have ten words to say to you. Will you listen to\r\nthem?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe marquis glared at him and then turned to his mother. \xe2\x80\x9cCan Mr.\r\nNewman possibly have anything to say that is worth our listening to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI assure you I have something,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, \xe2\x80\x9cbesides, it is my duty\r\nto say it. It\xe2\x80\x99s a notification\xe2\x80\x94a warning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour duty?\xe2\x80\x9d said old Madame de Bellegarde, her thin lips curving like\r\nscorched paper. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is your affair, not ours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame Urbain meanwhile had seized her little girl by the hand, with a\r\ngesture of surprise and impatience which struck Newman, intent as he\r\nwas upon his own words, with its dramatic effectiveness. \xe2\x80\x9cIf Mr. Newman\r\nis going to make a scene in public,\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cI will take my\r\npoor child out of the _m\xc3\xaal\xc3\xa9e_. She is too young to see such\r\nnaughtiness!\xe2\x80\x9d and she instantly resumed her walk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had much better listen to me,\xe2\x80\x9d Newman went on. \xe2\x80\x9cWhether you do or\r\nnot, things will be disagreeable for you; but at any rate you will be\r\nprepared.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have already heard something of your threats,\xe2\x80\x9d said the marquis,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand you know what we think of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think a good deal more than you admit. A moment,\xe2\x80\x9d Newman added in\r\nreply to an exclamation of the old lady. \xe2\x80\x9cI remember perfectly that we\r\nare in a public place, and you see I am very quiet. I am not going to\r\ntell your secret to the passers-by; I shall keep it, to begin with, for\r\ncertain picked listeners. Anyone who observes us will think that we are\r\nhaving a friendly chat, and that I am complimenting you, madam, on your\r\nvenerable virtues.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe marquis gave three short sharp raps on the ground with his stick.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI demand of you to step out of our path!\xe2\x80\x9d he hissed.\r\n\r\nNewman instantly complied, and M. de Bellegarde stepped forward with\r\nhis mother. Then Newman said, \xe2\x80\x9cHalf an hour hence Madame de Bellegarde\r\nwill regret that she didn\xe2\x80\x99t learn exactly what I mean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe marquise had taken a few steps, but at these words she paused,\r\nlooking at Newman with eyes like two scintillating globules of ice.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are like a peddler with something to sell,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with a\r\nlittle cold laugh which only partially concealed the tremor in her\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, not to sell,\xe2\x80\x9d Newman rejoined; \xe2\x80\x9cI give it to you for nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAnd he approached nearer to her, looking her straight in the eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nkilled your husband,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, almost in a whisper. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is, you tried\r\nonce and failed, and then, without trying, you succeeded.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame de Bellegarde closed her eyes and gave a little cough, which, as\r\na piece of dissimulation, struck Newman as really heroic. \xe2\x80\x9cDear\r\nmother,\xe2\x80\x9d said the marquis, \xe2\x80\x9cdoes this stuff amuse you so much?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe rest is more amusing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cYou had better not lose it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame de Bellegarde opened her eyes; the scintillations had gone out\r\nof them; they were fixed and dead. But she smiled superbly with her\r\nnarrow little lips, and repeated Newman\xe2\x80\x99s word. \xe2\x80\x9cAmusing? Have I killed\r\nsomeone else?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t count your daughter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, \xe2\x80\x9cthough I might! Your\r\nhusband knew what you were doing. I have a proof of it whose existence\r\nyou have never suspected.\xe2\x80\x9d And he turned to the marquis, who was\r\nterribly white\xe2\x80\x94whiter than Newman had ever seen anyone out of a\r\npicture. \xe2\x80\x9cA paper written by the hand, and signed with the name, of\r\nHenri-Urbain de Bellegarde. Written after you, madam, had left him for\r\ndead, and while you, sir, had gone\xe2\x80\x94not very fast\xe2\x80\x94for the doctor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe marquis looked at his mother; she turned away, looking vaguely\r\nround her. \xe2\x80\x9cI must sit down,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in a low tone, going toward the\r\nbench on which Newman had been sitting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you have spoken to me alone?\xe2\x80\x9d said the marquis to Newman,\r\nwith a strange look.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, yes, if I could have been sure of speaking to your mother alone,\r\ntoo,\xe2\x80\x9d Newman answered. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I have had to take you as I could get you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame de Bellegarde, with a movement very eloquent of what he would\r\nhave called her \xe2\x80\x9cgrit,\xe2\x80\x9d her steel-cold pluck and her instinctive appeal\r\nto her own personal resources, drew her hand out of her son\xe2\x80\x99s arm and\r\nwent and seated herself upon the bench. There she remained, with her\r\nhands folded in her lap, looking straight at Newman. The expression of\r\nher face was such that he fancied at first that she was smiling; but he\r\nwent and stood in front of her and saw that her elegant features were\r\ndistorted by agitation. He saw, however, equally, that she was\r\nresisting her agitation with all the rigor of her inflexible will, and\r\nthere was nothing like either fear or submission in her stony stare.\r\nShe had been startled, but she was not terrified. Newman had an\r\nexasperating feeling that she would get the better of him still; he\r\nwould not have believed it possible that he could so utterly fail to be\r\ntouched by the sight of a woman (criminal or other) in so tight a\r\nplace. Madame de Bellegarde gave a glance at her son which seemed\r\ntantamount to an injunction to be silent and leave her to her own\r\ndevices. The marquis stood beside her, with his hands behind him,\r\nlooking at Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat paper is this you speak of?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the old lady, with an\r\nimitation of tranquillity which would have been applauded in a veteran\r\nactress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly what I have told you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cA paper written by your\r\nhusband after you had left him for dead, and during the couple of hours\r\nbefore you returned. You see he had the time; you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have stayed\r\naway so long. It declares distinctly his wife\xe2\x80\x99s murderous intent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like to see it,\xe2\x80\x9d Madame de Bellegarde observed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you might,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, \xe2\x80\x9cand I have taken a copy.\xe2\x80\x9d And he\r\ndrew from his waistcoat pocket a small, folded sheet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive it to my son,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de Bellegarde. Newman handed it to the\r\nmarquis, whose mother, glancing at him, said simply, \xe2\x80\x9cLook at it.\xe2\x80\x9d M.\r\nde Bellegarde\xe2\x80\x99s eyes had a pale eagerness which it was useless for him\r\nto try to dissimulate; he took the paper in his light-gloved fingers\r\nand opened it. There was a silence, during which he read it. He had\r\nmore than time to read it, but still he said nothing; he stood staring\r\nat it. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is the original?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Madame de Bellegarde, in a voice\r\nwhich was really a consummate negation of impatience.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn a very safe place. Of course I can\xe2\x80\x99t show you that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou might want to take hold of it,\xe2\x80\x9d he added with conscious\r\nquaintness. \xe2\x80\x9cBut that\xe2\x80\x99s a very correct copy\xe2\x80\x94except, of course, the\r\nhandwriting. I am keeping the original to show someone else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. de Bellegarde at last looked up, and his eyes were still very eager.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo whom do you mean to show it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking of beginning with the duchess,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman; \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\nstout lady I saw at your ball. She asked me to come and see her, you\r\nknow. I thought at the moment I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have much to say to her; but\r\nmy little document will give us something to talk about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had better keep it, my son,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de Bellegarde.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy all means,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman; \xe2\x80\x9ckeep it and show it to your mother when\r\nyou get home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd after showing it to the duchess?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94asked the marquis, folding the\r\npaper and putting it away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take up the dukes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cThen the counts and the\r\nbarons\xe2\x80\x94all the people you had the cruelty to introduce me to in a\r\ncharacter of which you meant immediately to deprive me. I have made out\r\na list.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a moment neither Madame de Bellegarde nor her son said a word; the\r\nold lady sat with her eyes upon the ground; M. de Bellegarde\xe2\x80\x99s blanched\r\npupils were fixed upon her face. Then, looking at Newman, \xe2\x80\x9cIs that all\r\nyou have to say?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I want to say a few words more. I want to say that I hope you\r\nquite understand what I\xe2\x80\x99m about. This is my revenge, you know. You have\r\ntreated me before the world\xe2\x80\x94convened for the express purpose\xe2\x80\x94as if I\r\nwere not good enough for you. I mean to show the world that, however\r\nbad I may be, you are not quite the people to say it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame de Bellegarde was silent again, and then she broke her silence.\r\nHer self-possession continued to be extraordinary. \xe2\x80\x9cI needn\xe2\x80\x99t ask you\r\nwho has been your accomplice. Mrs. Bread told me that you had purchased\r\nher services.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t accuse Mrs. Bread of venality,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cShe has kept your\r\nsecret all these years. She has given you a long respite. It was\r\nbeneath her eyes your husband wrote that paper; he put it into her\r\nhands with a solemn injunction that she was to make it public. She was\r\ntoo good-hearted to make use of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old lady appeared for an instant to hesitate, and then, \xe2\x80\x9cShe was my\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s mistress,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, softly. This was the only concession to\r\nself-defense that she condescended to make.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI doubt that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\nMadame de Bellegarde got up from her bench. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was not to your\r\nopinions I undertook to listen, and if you have nothing left but them\r\nto tell me I think this remarkable interview may terminate.\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nturning to the marquis she took his arm again. \xe2\x80\x9cMy son,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9csay\r\nsomething!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. de Bellegarde looked down at his mother, passing his hand over his\r\nforehead, and then, tenderly, caressingly, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat shall I say?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is only one thing to say,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Marquise. \xe2\x80\x9cThat it was\r\nreally not worth while to have interrupted our walk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the marquis thought he could improve this. \xe2\x80\x9cYour paper\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nforgery,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Newman.\r\n\r\nNewman shook his head a little, with a tranquil smile. \xe2\x80\x9cM. de\r\nBellegarde,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cyour mother does better. She has done better all\r\nalong, from the first of my knowing you. You\xe2\x80\x99re a mighty plucky woman,\r\nmadam,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a great pity you have made me your enemy. I\r\nshould have been one of your greatest admirers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Mon pauvre ami_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame de Bellegarde to her son in French, and\r\nas if she had not heard these words, \xe2\x80\x9cyou must take me immediately to\r\nmy carriage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman stepped back and let them leave him; he watched them a moment\r\nand saw Madame Urbain, with her little girl, come out of a by-path to\r\nmeet them. The old lady stooped and kissed her grandchild. \xe2\x80\x9cDamn it,\r\nshe _is_ plucky!\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, and he walked home with a slight sense\r\nof being balked. She was so inexpressively defiant! But on reflection\r\nhe decided that what he had witnessed was no real sense of security,\r\nstill less a real innocence. It was only a very superior style of\r\nbrazen assurance. \xe2\x80\x9cWait till she reads the paper!\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself;\r\nand he concluded that he should hear from her soon.\r\n\r\nHe heard sooner than he expected. The next morning, before midday, when\r\nhe was about to give orders for his breakfast to be served, M. de\r\nBellegarde\xe2\x80\x99s card was brought to him. \xe2\x80\x9cShe has read the paper and she\r\nhas passed a bad night,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. He instantly admitted his\r\nvisitor, who came in with the air of the ambassador of a great power\r\nmeeting the delegate of a barbarous tribe whom an absurd accident had\r\nenabled for the moment to be abominably annoying. The ambassador, at\r\nall events, had passed a bad night, and his faultlessly careful toilet\r\nonly threw into relief the frigid rancor in his eyes and the mottled\r\ntones of his refined complexion. He stood before Newman a moment,\r\nbreathing quickly and softly, and shaking his forefinger curtly as his\r\nhost pointed to a chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I have come to say is soon said,\xe2\x80\x9d he declared \xe2\x80\x9cand can only be\r\nsaid without ceremony.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am good for as much or for as little as you desire,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\nThe marquis looked round the room a moment, and then, \xe2\x80\x9cOn what terms\r\nwill you part with your scrap of paper?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn none!\xe2\x80\x9d And while Newman, with his head on one side and his hands\r\nbehind him sounded the marquis\xe2\x80\x99s turbid gaze with his own, he added,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, that is not worth sitting down about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. de Bellegarde meditated a moment, as if he had not heard Newman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrefusal. \xe2\x80\x9cMy mother and I, last evening,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9ctalked over your\r\nstory. You will be surprised to learn that we think your little\r\ndocument is\xe2\x80\x94a\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and he held back his word a moment\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cis genuine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou forget that with you I am used to surprises!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Newman,\r\nwith a laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe very smallest amount of respect that we owe to my father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmemory,\xe2\x80\x9d the marquis continued, \xe2\x80\x9cmakes us desire that he should not be\r\nheld up to the world as the author of so\xe2\x80\x94so infernal an attack upon the\r\nreputation of a wife whose only fault was that she had been submissive\r\nto accumulated injury.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s for your father\xe2\x80\x99s sake.\xe2\x80\x9d And he laughed\r\nthe laugh in which he indulged when he was most amused\xe2\x80\x94a noiseless\r\nlaugh, with his lips closed.\r\n\r\nBut M. de Bellegarde\xe2\x80\x99s gravity held good. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are a few of my\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s particular friends for whom the knowledge of so\xe2\x80\x94so unfortunate\r\nan\xe2\x80\x94inspiration\xe2\x80\x94would be a real grief. Even say we firmly established by\r\nmedical evidence the presumption of a mind disordered by fever, _il en\r\nresterait quelque chose_. At the best it would look ill in him. Very\r\nill!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t try medical evidence,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t touch the doctors and\r\nthey won\xe2\x80\x99t touch you. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind your knowing that I have not written\r\nto them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman fancied that he saw signs in M. de Bellegarde\xe2\x80\x99s discolored mask\r\nthat this information was extremely pertinent. But it may have been\r\nmerely fancy; for the marquis remained majestically argumentative. \xe2\x80\x9cFor\r\ninstance, Madame d\xe2\x80\x99Outreville,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cof whom you spoke yesterday.\r\nI can imagine nothing that would shock her more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I am quite prepared to shock Madame d\xe2\x80\x99Outreville, you know. That\xe2\x80\x99s\r\non the cards. I expect to shock a great many people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. de Bellegarde examined for a moment the stitching on the back of one\r\nof his gloves. Then, without looking up, \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t offer you money,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cThat we supposed to be useless.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman, turning away, took a few turns about the room and then came\r\nback. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat _do_ you offer me? By what I can make out, the generosity\r\nis all to be on my side.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe marquis dropped his arms at his side and held his head a little\r\nhigher. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat we offer you is a chance\xe2\x80\x94a chance that a gentleman should\r\nappreciate. A chance to abstain from inflicting a terrible blot upon\r\nthe memory of a man who certainly had his faults, but who, personally,\r\nhad done you no wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are two things to say to that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cThe first is, as\r\nregards appreciating your \xe2\x80\x98chance,\xe2\x80\x99 that you don\xe2\x80\x99t consider me a\r\ngentleman. That\xe2\x80\x99s your great point you know. It\xe2\x80\x99s a poor rule that\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t work both ways. The second is that\xe2\x80\x94well, in a word, you are\r\ntalking great nonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman, who in the midst of his bitterness had, as I have said, kept\r\nwell before his eyes a certain ideal of saying nothing rude, was\r\nimmediately somewhat regretfully conscious of the sharpness of these\r\nwords. But he speedily observed that the marquis took them more quietly\r\nthan might have been expected. M. de Bellegarde, like the stately\r\nambassador that he was, continued the policy of ignoring what was\r\ndisagreeable in his adversary\xe2\x80\x99s replies. He gazed at the gilded\r\narabesques on the opposite wall, and then presently transferred his\r\nglance to Newman, as if he too were a large grotesque in a rather\r\nvulgar system of chamber-decoration. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you know that as\r\nregards yourself it won\xe2\x80\x99t do at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you mean it won\xe2\x80\x99t do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, of course you damn yourself. But I suppose that\xe2\x80\x99s in your\r\nprogramme. You propose to throw mud at us; you believe, you hope, that\r\nsome of it may stick. We know, of course, it can\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d explained the\r\nmarquis in a tone of conscious lucidity; \xe2\x80\x9cbut you take the chance, and\r\nare willing at any rate to show that you yourself have dirty hands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a good comparison; at least half of it is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ntake the chance of something sticking. But as regards my hands, they\r\nare clean. I have taken the matter up with my finger-tips.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. de Bellegarde looked a moment into his hat. \xe2\x80\x9cAll our friends are\r\nquite with us,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey would have done exactly as we have\r\ndone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall believe that when I hear them say it. Meanwhile I shall think\r\nbetter of human nature.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe marquis looked into his hat again. \xe2\x80\x9cMadame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 was extremely\r\nfond of her father. If she knew of the existence of the few written\r\nwords of which you propose to make this scandalous use, she would\r\ndemand of you proudly for his sake to give it up to her, and she would\r\ndestroy it without reading it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery possibly,\xe2\x80\x9d Newman rejoined. \xe2\x80\x9cBut she will not know. I was in that\r\nconvent yesterday and I know what _she_ is doing. Lord deliver us! You\r\ncan guess whether it made me feel forgiving!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. de Bellegarde appeared to have nothing more to suggest; but he\r\ncontinued to stand there, rigid and elegant, as a man who believed that\r\nhis mere personal presence had an argumentative value. Newman watched\r\nhim, and, without yielding an inch on the main issue, felt an\r\nincongruously good-natured impulse to help him to retreat in good\r\norder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour visit\xe2\x80\x99s a failure, you see,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou offer too little.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPropose something yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d said the marquis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me back Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 in the same state in which you took her\r\nfrom me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. de Bellegarde threw back his head and his pale face flushed.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever!\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t if we could! In the sentiment which led us to deprecate\r\nher marriage nothing is changed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Deprecate\xe2\x80\x99 is good!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was hardly worth while to come\r\nhere only to tell me that you are not ashamed of yourselves. I could\r\nhave guessed that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe marquis slowly walked toward the door, and Newman, following,\r\nopened it for him. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat you propose to do will be very disagreeable,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nM. de Bellegarde said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is very evident. But it will be nothing\r\nmore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs I understand it,\xe2\x80\x9d Newman answered, \xe2\x80\x9cthat will be quite enough!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. de Bellegarde stood for a moment looking on the ground, as if he\r\nwere ransacking his ingenuity to see what else he could do to save his\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s reputation. Then, with a little cold sigh, he seemed to\r\nsignify that he regretfully surrendered the late marquis to the penalty\r\nof his turpitude. He gave a hardly perceptible shrug, took his neat\r\numbrella from the servant in the vestibule, and, with his gentlemanly\r\nwalk, passed out. Newman stood listening till he heard the door close;\r\nthen he slowly exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I ought to begin to be satisfied now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\n\r\nNewman called upon the comical duchess and found her at home. An old\r\ngentleman with a high nose and a gold-headed cane was just taking leave\r\nof her; he made Newman a protracted obeisance as he retired, and our\r\nhero supposed that he was one of the mysterious grandees with whom he\r\nhad shaken hands at Madame de Bellegarde\xe2\x80\x99s ball. The duchess, in her\r\narmchair, from which she did not move, with a great flower-pot on one\r\nside of her, a pile of pink-covered novels on the other, and a large\r\npiece of tapestry depending from her lap, presented an expansive and\r\nimposing front; but her aspect was in the highest degree gracious, and\r\nthere was nothing in her manner to check the effusion of his\r\nconfidence. She talked to him about flowers and books, getting launched\r\nwith marvelous promptitude; about the theatres, about the peculiar\r\ninstitutions of his native country, about the humidity of Paris about\r\nthe pretty complexions of the American ladies, about his impressions of\r\nFrance and his opinion of its female inhabitants. All this was a\r\nbrilliant monologue on the part of the duchess, who, like many of her\r\ncountry-women, was a person of an affirmative rather than an\r\ninterrogative cast of mind, who made _mots_ and put them herself into\r\ncirculation, and who was apt to offer you a present of a convenient\r\nlittle opinion, neatly enveloped in the gilt paper of a happy\r\nGallicism. Newman had come to her with a grievance, but he found\r\nhimself in an atmosphere in which apparently no cognizance was taken of\r\ngrievance; an atmosphere into which the chill of discomfort had never\r\npenetrated, and which seemed exclusively made up of mild, sweet, stale\r\nintellectual perfumes. The feeling with which he had watched Madame\r\nd\xe2\x80\x99Outreville at the treacherous festival of the Bellegardes came back\r\nto him; she struck him as a wonderful old lady in a comedy,\r\nparticularly well up in her part. He observed before long that she\r\nasked him no questions about their common friends; she made no allusion\r\nto the circumstances under which he had been presented to her. She\r\nneither feigned ignorance of a change in these circumstances nor\r\npretended to condole with him upon it; but she smiled and discoursed\r\nand compared the tender-tinted wools of her tapestry, as if the\r\nBellegardes and their wickedness were not of this world. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is\r\nfighting shy!\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman to himself; and, having made the\r\nobservation, he was prompted to observe, farther, how the duchess would\r\ncarry off her indifference. She did so in a masterly manner. There was\r\nnot a gleam of disguised consciousness in those small, clear,\r\ndemonstrative eyes which constituted her nearest claim to personal\r\nloveliness, there was not a symptom of apprehension that Newman would\r\ntrench upon the ground she proposed to avoid. \xe2\x80\x9cUpon my word, she does\r\nit very well,\xe2\x80\x9d he tacitly commented. \xe2\x80\x9cThey all hold together bravely,\r\nand, whether anyone else can trust them or not, they can certainly\r\ntrust each other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman, at this juncture, fell to admiring the duchess for her fine\r\nmanners. He felt, most accurately, that she was not a grain less urbane\r\nthan she would have been if his marriage were still in prospect; but he\r\nfelt also that she was not a particle more urbane. He had come, so\r\nreasoned the duchess\xe2\x80\x94Heaven knew why he had come, after what had\r\nhappened; and for the half hour, therefore, she would be _charmante_.\r\nBut she would never see him again. Finding no ready-made opportunity to\r\ntell his story, Newman pondered these things more dispassionately than\r\nmight have been expected; he stretched his legs, as usual, and even\r\nchuckled a little, appreciatively and noiselessly. And then as the\r\nduchess went on relating a _mot_ with which her mother had snubbed the\r\ngreat Napoleon, it occurred to Newman that her evasion of a chapter of\r\nFrench history more interesting to himself might possibly be the result\r\nof an extreme consideration for his feelings. Perhaps it was delicacy\r\non the duchess\xe2\x80\x99s part\xe2\x80\x94not policy. He was on the point of saying\r\nsomething himself, to make the chance which he had determined to give\r\nher still better, when the servant announced another visitor. The\r\nduchess, on hearing the name\xe2\x80\x94it was that of an Italian prince\xe2\x80\x94gave a\r\nlittle imperceptible pout, and said to Newman, rapidly: \xe2\x80\x9cI beg you to\r\nremain; I desire this visit to be short.\xe2\x80\x9d Newman said to himself, at\r\nthis, that Madame d\xe2\x80\x99Outreville intended, after all, that they should\r\ndiscuss the Bellegardes together.\r\n\r\nThe prince was a short, stout man, with a head disproportionately\r\nlarge. He had a dusky complexion and a bushy eyebrow, beneath which his\r\neye wore a fixed and somewhat defiant expression; he seemed to be\r\nchallenging you to insinuate that he was top-heavy. The duchess,\r\njudging from her charge to Newman, regarded him as a bore; but this was\r\nnot apparent from the unchecked flow of her conversation. She made a\r\nfresh series of _mots_, characterized with great felicity the Italian\r\nintellect and the taste of the figs at Sorrento, predicted the ultimate\r\nfuture of the Italian kingdom (disgust with the brutal Sardinian rule\r\nand complete reversion, throughout the peninsula, to the sacred sway of\r\nthe Holy Father), and, finally, gave a history of the love affairs of\r\nthe Princess X\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94. This narrative provoked some rectifications on the\r\npart of the prince, who, as he said, pretended to know something about\r\nthat matter; and having satisfied himself that Newman was in no\r\nlaughing mood, either with regard to the size of his head or anything\r\nelse, he entered into the controversy with an animation for which the\r\nduchess, when she set him down as a bore, could not have been prepared.\r\nThe sentimental vicissitudes of the Princess X\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 led to a discussion of\r\nthe heart history of Florentine nobility in general; the duchess had\r\nspent five weeks in Florence and had gathered much information on the\r\nsubject. This was merged, in turn, in an examination of the Italian\r\nheart _per se_. The duchess took a brilliantly heterodox view\xe2\x80\x94thought\r\nit the least susceptible organ of its kind that she had ever\r\nencountered, related examples of its want of susceptibility, and at\r\nlast declared that for her the Italians were a people of ice. The\r\nprince became flame to refute her, and his visit really proved\r\ncharming. Newman was naturally out of the conversation; he sat with his\r\nhead a little on one side, watching the interlocutors. The duchess, as\r\nshe talked, frequently looked at him with a smile, as if to intimate,\r\nin the charming manner of her nation, that it lay only with him to say\r\nsomething very much to the point. But he said nothing at all, and at\r\nlast his thoughts began to wander. A singular feeling came over him\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nsudden sense of the folly of his errand. What under the sun had he to\r\nsay to the duchess, after all? Wherein would it profit him to tell her\r\nthat the Bellegardes were traitors and that the old lady, into the\r\nbargain was a murderess? He seemed morally to have turned a sort of\r\nsomersault, and to find things looking differently in consequence. He\r\nfelt a sudden stiffening of his will and quickening of his reserve.\r\nWhat in the world had he been thinking of when he fancied the duchess\r\ncould help him, and that it would conduce to his comfort to make her\r\nthink ill of the Bellegardes? What did her opinion of the Bellegardes\r\nmatter to him? It was only a shade more important than the opinion the\r\nBellegardes entertained of her. The duchess help him\xe2\x80\x94that cold, stout,\r\nsoft, artificial woman help him?\xe2\x80\x94she who in the last twenty minutes had\r\nbuilt up between them a wall of polite conversation in which she\r\nevidently flattered herself that he would never find a gate. Had it\r\ncome to that\xe2\x80\x94that he was asking favors of conceited people, and\r\nappealing for sympathy where he had no sympathy to give? He rested his\r\narms on his knees, and sat for some minutes staring into his hat. As he\r\ndid so his ears tingled\xe2\x80\x94he had come very near being an ass. Whether or\r\nno the duchess would hear his story, he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell it. Was he to sit\r\nthere another half hour for the sake of exposing the Bellegardes? The\r\nBellegardes be hanged! He got up abruptly, and advanced to shake hands\r\nwith his hostess.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t stay longer?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked very graciously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid not,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nShe hesitated a moment, and then, \xe2\x80\x9cI had an idea you had something\r\nparticular to say to me,\xe2\x80\x9d she declared.\r\n\r\nNewman looked at her; he felt a little dizzy; for the moment he seemed\r\nto be turning his somersault again. The little Italian prince came to\r\nhis help: \xe2\x80\x9cAh, madam, who has not that?\xe2\x80\x9d he softly sighed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t teach Mr. Newman to say _fadaises_,\xe2\x80\x9d said the duchess. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is\r\nhis merit that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know how.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to say _fadaises_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, \xe2\x80\x9cand I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwant to say anything unpleasant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sure you are very considerate,\xe2\x80\x9d said the duchess with a smile;\r\nand she gave him a little nod for good-bye with which he took his\r\ndeparture.\r\n\r\nOnce in the street, he stood for some time on the pavement, wondering\r\nwhether, after all, he was not an ass not to have discharged his\r\npistol. And then again he decided that to talk to anyone whomsoever\r\nabout the Bellegardes would be extremely disagreeable to him. The least\r\ndisagreeable thing, under the circumstances, was to banish them from\r\nhis mind, and never think of them again. Indecision had not hitherto\r\nbeen one of Newman\xe2\x80\x99s weaknesses, and in this case it was not of long\r\nduration. For three days after this he did not, or at least he tried\r\nnot to, think of the Bellegardes. He dined with Mrs. Tristram, and on\r\nher mentioning their name, he begged her almost severely to desist.\r\nThis gave Tom Tristram a much-coveted opportunity to offer his\r\ncondolences.\r\n\r\nHe leaned forward, laying his hand on Newman\xe2\x80\x99s arm compressing his lips\r\nand shaking his head. \xe2\x80\x9cThe fact is my dear fellow, you see, that you\r\nought never to have gone into it. It was not your doing, I know\xe2\x80\x94it was\r\nall my wife. If you want to come down on her, I\xe2\x80\x99ll stand off; I give\r\nyou leave to hit her as hard as you like. You know she has never had a\r\nword of reproach from me in her life, and I think she is in need of\r\nsomething of the kind. Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you listen to _me?_ You know I didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbelieve in the thing. I thought it at the best an amiable delusion. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t profess to be a Don Juan or a gay Lothario,\xe2\x80\x94that class of man,\r\nyou know; but I do pretend to know something about the harder sex. I\r\nhave never disliked a woman in my life that she has not turned out\r\nbadly. I was not at all deceived in Lizzie, for instance; I always had\r\nmy doubts about her. Whatever you may think of my present situation, I\r\nmust at least admit that I got into it with my eyes open. Now suppose\r\nyou had got into something like this box with Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9. You may\r\ndepend upon it she would have turned out a stiff one. And upon my word\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t see where you could have found your comfort. Not from the\r\nmarquis, my dear Newman; he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a man you could go and talk things\r\nover with in a sociable, common-sense way. Did he ever seem to want to\r\nhave you on the premises\xe2\x80\x94did he ever try to see you alone? Did he ever\r\nask you to come and smoke a cigar with him of an evening, or step in,\r\nwhen you had been calling on the ladies, and take something? I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink you would have got much encouragement out of _him_. And as for\r\nthe old lady, she struck one as an uncommonly strong dose. They have a\r\ngreat expression here, you know; they call it \xe2\x80\x98sympathetic.\xe2\x80\x99 Everything\r\nis sympathetic\xe2\x80\x94or ought to be. Now Madame de Bellegarde is about as\r\nsympathetic as that mustard-pot. They\xe2\x80\x99re a d\xe2\x80\x94d cold-blooded lot, any\r\nway; I felt it awfully at that ball of theirs. I felt as if I were\r\nwalking up and down in the Armory, in the Tower of London! My dear boy,\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t think me a vulgar brute for hinting at it, but you may depend\r\nupon it, all they wanted was your money. I know something about that; I\r\ncan tell when people want one\xe2\x80\x99s money! Why they stopped wanting yours I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know; I suppose because they could get someone else\xe2\x80\x99s without\r\nworking so hard for it. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t worth finding out. It may be that it\r\nwas not Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 that backed out first, very likely the old\r\nwoman put her up to it. I suspect she and her mother are really as\r\nthick as thieves, eh? You are well out of it, my boy; make up your mind\r\nto that. If I express myself strongly it is all because I love you so\r\nmuch; and from that point of view I may say I should as soon have\r\nthought of making up to that piece of pale high-mightiness as I should\r\nhave thought of making up to the Obelisk in the Place de la Concorde.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman sat gazing at Tristram during this harangue with a lack-lustre\r\neye; never yet had he seemed to himself to have outgrown so completely\r\nthe phase of equal comradeship with Tom Tristram. Mrs. Tristram\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nglance at her husband had more of a spark; she turned to Newman with a\r\nslightly lurid smile. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must at least do justice,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cto the\r\nfelicity with which Mr. Tristram repairs the indiscretions of a too\r\nzealous wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut even without the aid of Tom Tristram\xe2\x80\x99s conversational felicities,\r\nNewman would have begun to think of the Bellegardes again. He could\r\ncease to think of them only when he ceased to think of his loss and\r\nprivation, and the days had as yet but scantily lightened the weight of\r\nthis incommodity. In vain Mrs. Tristram begged him to cheer up; she\r\nassured him that the sight of his countenance made her miserable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can I help it?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded with a trembling voice. \xe2\x80\x9cI feel like a\r\nwidower\xe2\x80\x94and a widower who has not even the consolation of going to\r\nstand beside the grave of his wife\xe2\x80\x94who has not the right to wear so\r\nmuch mourning as a weed on his hat. I feel,\xe2\x80\x9d he added in a moment \xe2\x80\x9cas\r\nif my wife had been murdered and her assassins were still at large.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Tristram made no immediate rejoinder, but at last she said, with a\r\nsmile which, in so far as it was a forced one, was less successfully\r\nsimulated than such smiles, on her lips, usually were; \xe2\x80\x9cAre you very\r\nsure that you would have been happy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman stared a moment, and then shook his head. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s weak,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid; \xe2\x80\x9cthat won\xe2\x80\x99t do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Tristram with a more triumphant bravery, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbelieve you would have been happy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman gave a little laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cSay I should have been miserable, then;\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s a misery I should have preferred to any happiness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Tristram began to muse. \xe2\x80\x9cI should have been curious to see; it\r\nwould have been very strange.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas it from curiosity that you urged me to try and marry her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA little,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Tristram, growing still more audacious. Newman\r\ngave her the one angry look he had been destined ever to give her,\r\nturned away and took up his hat. She watched him a moment, and then she\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cThat sounds very cruel, but it is less so than it sounds.\r\nCuriosity has a share in almost everything I do. I wanted very much to\r\nsee, first, whether such a marriage could actually take place; second,\r\nwhat would happen if it should take place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you didn\xe2\x80\x99t believe,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, resentfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I believed\xe2\x80\x94I believed that it would take place, and that you\r\nwould be happy. Otherwise I should have been, among my speculations, a\r\nvery heartless creature. _But_,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, laying her hand upon\r\nNewman\xe2\x80\x99s arm and hazarding a grave smile, \xe2\x80\x9cit was the highest flight\r\never taken by a tolerably bold imagination!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShortly after this she recommended him to leave Paris and travel for\r\nthree months. Change of scene would do him good, and he would forget\r\nhis misfortune sooner in absence from the objects which had witnessed\r\nit. \xe2\x80\x9cI really feel,\xe2\x80\x9d Newman rejoined, \xe2\x80\x9cas if to leave _you_, at least,\r\nwould do me good\xe2\x80\x94and cost me very little effort. You are growing\r\ncynical, you shock me and pain me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Tristram, good-naturedly or cynically, as may be\r\nthought most probable. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall certainly see you again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman was very willing to get away from Paris; the brilliant streets\r\nhe had walked through in his happier hours, and which then seemed to\r\nwear a higher brilliancy in honor of his happiness, appeared now to be\r\nin the secret of his defeat and to look down upon it in shining\r\nmockery. He would go somewhere; he cared little where; and he made his\r\npreparations. Then, one morning, at haphazard, he drove to the train\r\nthat would transport him to Boulogne and dispatch him thence to the\r\nshores of Britain. As he rolled along in the train he asked himself\r\nwhat had become of his revenge, and he was able to say that it was\r\nprovisionally pigeon-holed in a very safe place; it would keep till\r\ncalled for.\r\n\r\nHe arrived in London in the midst of what is called \xe2\x80\x9cthe season,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nit seemed to him at first that he might here put himself in the way of\r\nbeing diverted from his heavy-heartedness. He knew no one in all\r\nEngland, but the spectacle of the mighty metropolis roused him somewhat\r\nfrom his apathy. Anything that was enormous usually found favor with\r\nNewman, and the multitudinous energies and industries of England\r\nstirred within him a dull vivacity of contemplation. It is on record\r\nthat the weather, at that moment, was of the finest English quality; he\r\ntook long walks and explored London in every direction; he sat by the\r\nhour in Kensington Gardens and beside the adjoining Drive, watching the\r\npeople and the horses and the carriages; the rosy English beauties, the\r\nwonderful English dandies, and the splendid flunkies. He went to the\r\nopera and found it better than in Paris; he went to the theatre and\r\nfound a surprising charm in listening to dialogue the finest points of\r\nwhich came within the range of his comprehension. He made several\r\nexcursions into the country, recommended by the waiter at his hotel,\r\nwith whom, on this and similar points, he had established confidential\r\nrelations. He watched the deer in Windsor Forest and admired the Thames\r\nfrom Richmond Hill; he ate white-bait and brown-bread and butter at\r\nGreenwich, and strolled in the grassy shadow of the cathedral of\r\nCanterbury. He also visited the Tower of London and Madame Tussaud\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nexhibition. One day he thought he would go to Sheffield, and then,\r\nthinking again, he gave it up. Why should he go to Sheffield? He had a\r\nfeeling that the link which bound him to a possible interest in the\r\nmanufacture of cutlery was broken. He had no desire for an \xe2\x80\x9cinside\r\nview\xe2\x80\x9d of any successful enterprise whatever, and he would not have\r\ngiven the smallest sum for the privilege of talking over the details of\r\nthe most \xe2\x80\x9csplendid\xe2\x80\x9d business with the shrewdest of overseers.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon he had walked into Hyde Park, and was slowly threading\r\nhis way through the human maze which edges the Drive. The stream of\r\ncarriages was no less dense, and Newman, as usual, marveled at the\r\nstrange, dingy figures which he saw taking the air in some of the\r\nstateliest vehicles. They reminded him of what he had read of eastern\r\nand southern countries, in which grotesque idols and fetiches were\r\nsometimes taken out of their temples and carried abroad in golden\r\nchariots to be displayed to the multitude. He saw a great many pretty\r\ncheeks beneath high-plumed hats as he squeezed his way through serried\r\nwaves of crumpled muslin; and sitting on little chairs at the base of\r\nthe great serious English trees, he observed a number of quiet-eyed\r\nmaidens who seemed only to remind him afresh that the magic of beauty\r\nhad gone out of the world with Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9: to say nothing of\r\nother damsels, whose eyes were not quiet, and who struck him still more\r\nas a satire on possible consolation. He had been walking for some time,\r\nwhen, directly in front of him, borne back by the summer breeze, he\r\nheard a few words uttered in that bright Parisian idiom from which his\r\nears had begun to alienate themselves. The voice in which the words\r\nwere spoken made them seem even more like a thing with which he had\r\nonce been familiar, and as he bent his eyes it lent an identity to the\r\ncommonplace elegance of the back hair and shoulders of a young lady\r\nwalking in the same direction as himself. Mademoiselle Nioche,\r\napparently, had come to seek a more rapid advancement in London, and\r\nanother glance led Newman to suppose that she had found it. A gentleman\r\nwas strolling beside her, lending a most attentive ear to her\r\nconversation and too entranced to open his lips. Newman did not hear\r\nhis voice, but perceived that he presented the dorsal expression of a\r\nwell-dressed Englishman. Mademoiselle Nioche was attracting attention:\r\nthe ladies who passed her turned round to survey the Parisian\r\nperfection of her toilet. A great cataract of flounces rolled down from\r\nthe young lady\xe2\x80\x99s waist to Newman\xe2\x80\x99s feet; he had to step aside to avoid\r\ntreading upon them. He stepped aside, indeed, with a decision of\r\nmovement which the occasion scarcely demanded; for even this imperfect\r\nglimpse of Miss No\xc3\xa9mie had excited his displeasure. She seemed an\r\nodious blot upon the face of nature; he wanted to put her out of his\r\nsight. He thought of Valentin de Bellegarde, still green in the earth\r\nof his burial\xe2\x80\x94his young life clipped by this flourishing impudence. The\r\nperfume of the young lady\xe2\x80\x99s finery sickened him; he turned his head and\r\ntried to deflect his course; but the pressure of the crowd kept him\r\nnear her a few minutes longer, so that he heard what she was saying.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, I am sure he will miss me,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was very cruel in me\r\nto leave him; I am afraid you will think me a very heartless creature.\r\nHe might perfectly well have come with us. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he is very\r\nwell,\xe2\x80\x9d she added; \xe2\x80\x9cit seemed to me to-day that he was not very gay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman wondered whom she was talking about, but just then an opening\r\namong his neighbors enabled him to turn away, and he said to himself\r\nthat she was probably paying a tribute to British propriety and playing\r\nat tender solicitude about her papa. Was that miserable old man still\r\ntreading the path of vice in her train? Was he still giving her the\r\nbenefit of his experience of affairs, and had he crossed the sea to\r\nserve as her interpreter? Newman walked some distance farther, and then\r\nbegan to retrace his steps taking care not to traverse again the orbit\r\nof Mademoiselle Nioche. At last he looked for a chair under the trees,\r\nbut he had some difficulty in finding an empty one. He was about to\r\ngive up the search when he saw a gentleman rise from the seat he had\r\nbeen occupying, leaving Newman to take it without looking at his\r\nneighbors. He sat there for some time without heeding them; his\r\nattention was lost in the irritation and bitterness produced by his\r\nrecent glimpse of Miss No\xc3\xa9mie\xe2\x80\x99s iniquitous vitality. But at the end of\r\na quarter of an hour, dropping his eyes, he perceived a small pug-dog\r\nsquatted upon the path near his feet\xe2\x80\x94a diminutive but very perfect\r\nspecimen of its interesting species. The pug was sniffing at the\r\nfashionable world, as it passed him, with his little black muzzle, and\r\nwas kept from extending his investigation by a large blue ribbon\r\nattached to his collar with an enormous rosette and held in the hand of\r\na person seated next to Newman. To this person Newman transferred his\r\nattention, and immediately perceived that he was the object of all that\r\nof his neighbor, who was staring up at him from a pair of little fixed\r\nwhite eyes. These eyes Newman instantly recognized; he had been sitting\r\nfor the last quarter of an hour beside M. Nioche. He had vaguely felt\r\nthat someone was staring at him. M. Nioche continued to stare; he\r\nappeared afraid to move, even to the extent of evading Newman\xe2\x80\x99s glance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman; \xe2\x80\x9care you here, too?\xe2\x80\x9d And he looked at his\r\nneighbor\xe2\x80\x99s helplessness more grimly than he knew. M. Nioche had a new\r\nhat and a pair of kid gloves; his clothes, too, seemed to belong to a\r\nmore recent antiquity than of yore. Over his arm was suspended a lady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmantilla\xe2\x80\x94a light and brilliant tissue, fringed with white lace\xe2\x80\x94which\r\nhad apparently been committed to his keeping; and the little dog\xe2\x80\x99s blue\r\nribbon was wound tightly round his hand. There was no expression of\r\nrecognition in his face\xe2\x80\x94or of anything indeed save a sort of feeble,\r\nfascinated dread; Newman looked at the pug and the lace mantilla, and\r\nthen he met the old man\xe2\x80\x99s eyes again. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know me, I see,\xe2\x80\x9d he pursued.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou might have spoken to me before.\xe2\x80\x9d M. Nioche still said nothing, but\r\nit seemed to Newman that his eyes began faintly to water. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nexpect,\xe2\x80\x9d our hero went on, \xe2\x80\x9cto meet you so far from\xe2\x80\x94from the Caf\xc3\xa9 de la\r\nPatrie.\xe2\x80\x9d The old man remained silent, but decidedly Newman had touched\r\nthe source of tears. His neighbor sat staring and Newman added, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe matter, M. Nioche? You used to talk\xe2\x80\x94to talk very prettily. Don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou remember you even gave lessons in conversation?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this M. Nioche decided to change his attitude. He stooped and picked\r\nup the pug, lifted it to his face and wiped his eyes on its little soft\r\nback. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid to speak to you,\xe2\x80\x9d he presently said, looking over the\r\npuppy\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder. \xe2\x80\x9cI hoped you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t notice me. I should have moved\r\naway, but I was afraid that if I moved you would notice me. So I sat\r\nvery still.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suspect you have a bad conscience, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\nThe old man put down the little dog and held it carefully in his lap.\r\nThen he shook his head, with his eyes still fixed upon his\r\ninterlocutor. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, Mr. Newman, I have a good conscience,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why should you want to slink away from me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause\xe2\x80\x94because you don\xe2\x80\x99t understand my position.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I think you once explained it to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it seems\r\nimproved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImproved!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed M. Nioche, under his breath. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you call this\r\nimprovement?\xe2\x80\x9d And he glanced at the treasures in his arms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you are on your travels,\xe2\x80\x9d Newman rejoined. \xe2\x80\x9cA visit to London in\r\nthe season is certainly a sign of prosperity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. Nioche, in answer to this cruel piece of irony, lifted the puppy up\r\nto his face again, peering at Newman with his small blank eye-holes.\r\nThere was something almost imbecile in the movement, and Newman hardly\r\nknew whether he was taking refuge in a convenient affectation of\r\nunreason, or whether he had in fact paid for his dishonor by the loss\r\nof his wits. In the latter case, just now, he felt little more tenderly\r\nto the foolish old man than in the former. Responsible or not, he was\r\nequally an accomplice of his detestably mischievous daughter. Newman\r\nwas going to leave him abruptly, when a ray of entreaty appeared to\r\ndisengage itself from the old man\xe2\x80\x99s misty gaze. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you going away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you want me to stay?\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should have left you\xe2\x80\x94from consideration. But my dignity suffers at\r\nyour leaving me\xe2\x80\x94that way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you got anything particular to say to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. Nioche looked around him to see that no one was listening, and then\r\nhe said, very softly but distinctly, \xe2\x80\x9cI have _not_ forgiven her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman gave a short laugh, but the old man seemed for the moment not to\r\nperceive it; he was gazing away, absently, at some metaphysical image\r\nof his implacability. \xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t much matter whether you forgive her\r\nor not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are other people who won\xe2\x80\x99t, I assure you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat has she done?\xe2\x80\x9d M. Nioche softly questioned, turning round again.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what she does, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has done a devilish mischief; it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter what,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nNewman. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s a nuisance; she ought to be stopped.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. Nioche stealthily put out his hand and laid it very gently upon\r\nNewman\xe2\x80\x99s arm. \xe2\x80\x9cStopped, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it. Stopped short.\r\nShe is running away\xe2\x80\x94she must be stopped.\xe2\x80\x9d Then he paused a moment and\r\nlooked round him. \xe2\x80\x9cI mean to stop her,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on. \xe2\x80\x9cI am only waiting\r\nfor my chance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, laughing briefly again. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is running away and\r\nyou are running after her. You have run a long distance!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut M. Nioche stared insistently: \xe2\x80\x9cI shall stop her!\xe2\x80\x9d he softly\r\nrepeated.\r\n\r\nHe had hardly spoken when the crowd in front of them separated, as if\r\nby the impulse to make way for an important personage. Presently,\r\nthrough the opening, advanced Mademoiselle Nioche, attended by the\r\ngentleman whom Newman had lately observed. His face being now presented\r\nto our hero, the latter recognized the irregular features, the hardly\r\nmore regular complexion, and the amiable expression of Lord Deepmere.\r\nNo\xc3\xa9mie, on finding herself suddenly confronted with Newman, who, like\r\nM. Nioche, had risen from his seat, faltered for a barely perceptible\r\ninstant. She gave him a little nod, as if she had seen him yesterday,\r\nand then, with a good-natured smile, \xe2\x80\x9c_Tiens_, how we keep meeting!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe said. She looked consummately pretty, and the front of her dress\r\nwas a wonderful work of art. She went up to her father, stretching out\r\nher hands for the little dog, which he submissively placed in them, and\r\nshe began to kiss it and murmur over it: \xe2\x80\x9cTo think of leaving him all\r\nalone,\xe2\x80\x94what a wicked, abominable creature he must believe me! He has\r\nbeen very unwell,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, turning and affecting to explain to\r\nNewman, with a spark of infernal impudence, fine as a needlepoint, in\r\nher eye. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think the English climate agrees with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to agree wonderfully well with his mistress,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean me? I have never been better, thank you,\xe2\x80\x9d Miss No\xc3\xa9mie\r\ndeclared. \xe2\x80\x9cBut with _milord_\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and she gave a brilliant glance at her\r\nlate companion\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9chow can one help being well?\xe2\x80\x9d She seated herself in the\r\nchair from which her father had risen, and began to arrange the little\r\ndog\xe2\x80\x99s rosette.\r\n\r\nLord Deepmere carried off such embarrassment as might be incidental to\r\nthis unexpected encounter with the inferior grace of a male and a\r\nBriton. He blushed a good deal, and greeted the object of his late\r\nmomentary aspiration to rivalry in the favor of a person other than the\r\nmistress of the invalid pug with an awkward nod and a rapid\r\nejaculation\xe2\x80\x94an ejaculation to which Newman, who often found it hard to\r\nunderstand the speech of English people, was able to attach no meaning.\r\nThen the young man stood there, with his hand on his hip, and with a\r\nconscious grin, staring askance at Miss No\xc3\xa9mie. Suddenly an idea seemed\r\nto strike him, and he said, turning to Newman, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, you know her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, \xe2\x80\x9cI know her. I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe you do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh dear, yes, I do!\xe2\x80\x9d said Lord Deepmere, with another grin. \xe2\x80\x9cI knew\r\nher in Paris\xe2\x80\x94by my poor cousin Bellegarde, you know. He knew her, poor\r\nfellow, didn\xe2\x80\x99t he? It was she, you know, who was at the bottom of his\r\naffair. Awfully sad, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d continued the young man, talking off\r\nhis embarrassment as his simple nature permitted. \xe2\x80\x9cThey got up some\r\nstory about its being for the Pope; about the other man having said\r\nsomething against the Pope\xe2\x80\x99s morals. They always do that, you know.\r\nThey put it on the Pope because Bellegarde was once in the Zouaves. But\r\nit was about _her_ morals\xe2\x80\x94_she_ was the Pope!\xe2\x80\x9d Lord Deepmere pursued,\r\ndirecting an eye illumined by this pleasantry toward Mademoiselle\r\nNioche, who was bending gracefully over her lap-dog, apparently\r\nabsorbed in conversation with it. \xe2\x80\x9cI dare say you think it rather odd\r\nthat I should\xe2\x80\x94ah\xe2\x80\x94keep up the acquaintance,\xe2\x80\x9d the young man resumed; \xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\nshe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help it, you know, and Bellegarde was only my twentieth\r\ncousin. I dare say you think it\xe2\x80\x99s rather cheeky, my showing with her in\r\nHyde Park, but you see she isn\xe2\x80\x99t known yet, and she\xe2\x80\x99s in such very good\r\nform\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d And Lord Deepmere\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion was lost in the attesting glance\r\nwhich he again directed toward the young lady.\r\n\r\nNewman turned away; he was having more of her than he relished. M.\r\nNioche had stepped aside on his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s approach, and he stood\r\nthere, within a very small compass, looking down hard at the ground. It\r\nhad never yet, as between him and Newman, been so apposite to place on\r\nrecord the fact that he had not forgiven his daughter. As Newman was\r\nmoving away he looked up and drew near to him, and Newman, seeing the\r\nold man had something particular to say, bent his head for an instant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will see it some day in the papers,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured M. Nioche.\r\n\r\nOur hero departed to hide his smile, and to this day, though the\r\nnewspapers form his principal reading, his eyes have not been arrested\r\nby any paragraph forming a sequel to this announcement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\n\r\nIn that uninitiated observation of the great spectacle of English life\r\nupon which I have touched, it might be supposed that Newman passed a\r\ngreat many dull days. But the dullness of his days pleased him; his\r\nmelancholy, which was settling into a secondary stage, like a healing\r\nwound, had in it a certain acrid, palatable sweetness. He had company\r\nin his thoughts, and for the present he wanted no other. He had no\r\ndesire to make acquaintances, and he left untouched a couple of notes\r\nof introduction which had been sent him by Tom Tristram. He thought a\r\ngreat deal of Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x94sometimes with a dogged tranquillity\r\nwhich might have seemed, for a quarter of an hour at a time, a near\r\nneighbor to forgetfulness. He lived over again the happiest hours he\r\nhad known\xe2\x80\x94that silver chain of numbered days in which his afternoon\r\nvisits, tending sensibly to the ideal result, had subtilized his good\r\nhumor to a sort of spiritual intoxication. He came back to reality,\r\nafter such reveries, with a somewhat muffled shock; he had begun to\r\nfeel the need of accepting the unchangeable. At other times the reality\r\nbecame an infamy again and the unchangeable an imposture, and he gave\r\nhimself up to his angry restlessness till he was weary. But on the\r\nwhole he fell into a rather reflective mood. Without in the least\r\nintending it or knowing it, he attempted to read the moral of his\r\nstrange misadventure. He asked himself, in his quieter hours, whether\r\nperhaps, after all, he _was_ more commercial than was pleasant. We know\r\nthat it was in obedience to a strong reaction against questions\r\nexclusively commercial that he had come out to pick up \xc3\xa6sthetic\r\nentertainment in Europe; it may therefore be understood that he was\r\nable to conceive that a man might be too commercial. He was very\r\nwilling to grant it, but the concession, as to his own case, was not\r\nmade with any very oppressive sense of shame. If he had been too\r\ncommercial, he was ready to forget it, for in being so he had done no\r\nman any wrong that might not be as easily forgotten. He reflected with\r\nsober placidity that at least there were no monuments of his \xe2\x80\x9cmeanness\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nscattered about the world. If there was any reason in the nature of\r\nthings why his connection with business should have cast a shadow upon\r\na connection\xe2\x80\x94even a connection broken\xe2\x80\x94with a woman justly proud, he was\r\nwilling to sponge it out of his life forever. The thing seemed a\r\npossibility; he could not feel it, doubtless, as keenly as some people,\r\nand it hardly seemed worth while to flap his wings very hard to rise to\r\nthe idea; but he could feel it enough to make any sacrifice that still\r\nremained to be made. As to what such sacrifice was now to be made to,\r\nhere Newman stopped short before a blank wall over which there\r\nsometimes played a shadowy imagery. He had a fancy of carrying out his\r\nlife as he would have directed it if Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 had been left to\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x94of making it a religion to do nothing that she would have disliked.\r\nIn this, certainly, there was no sacrifice; but there was a pale,\r\noblique ray of inspiration. It would be lonely entertainment\xe2\x80\x94a good\r\ndeal like a man talking to himself in the mirror for want of better\r\ncompany. Yet the idea yielded Newman several half hours\xe2\x80\x99 dumb\r\nexaltation as he sat, with his hands in his pockets and his legs\r\nstretched, over the relics of an expensively poor dinner, in the\r\nundying English twilight. If, however, his commercial imagination was\r\ndead, he felt no contempt for the surviving actualities begotten by it.\r\nHe was glad he had been prosperous and had been a great man of business\r\nrather than a small one; he was extremely glad he was rich. He felt no\r\nimpulse to sell all he had and give to the poor, or to retire into\r\nmeditative economy and asceticism. He was glad he was rich and\r\ntolerably young; if it was possible to think too much about buying and\r\nselling, it was a gain to have a good slice of life left in which not\r\nto think about them. Come, what should he think about now? Again and\r\nagain Newman could think only of one thing; his thoughts always came\r\nback to it, and as they did so, with an emotional rush which seemed\r\nphysically to express itself in a sudden upward choking, he leaned\r\nforward\xe2\x80\x94the waiter having left the room\xe2\x80\x94and, resting his arms on the\r\ntable, buried his troubled face.\r\n\r\nHe remained in England till midsummer, and spent a month in the\r\ncountry, wandering about cathedrals, castles, and ruins. Several times,\r\ntaking a walk from his inn into meadows and parks, he stopped by a\r\nwell-worn stile, looked across through the early evening at a gray\r\nchurch tower, with its dusky nimbus of thick-circling swallows, and\r\nremembered that this might have been part of the entertainment of his\r\nhoneymoon. He had never been so much alone or indulged so little in\r\naccidental dialogue. The period of recreation appointed by Mrs.\r\nTristram had at last expired, and he asked himself what he should do\r\nnow. Mrs. Tristram had written to him, proposing to him that he should\r\njoin her in the Pyrenees; but he was not in the humor to return to\r\nFrance. The simplest thing was to repair to Liverpool and embark on the\r\nfirst American steamer. Newman made his way to the great seaport and\r\nsecured his berth; and the night before sailing he sat in his room at\r\nthe hotel, staring down, vacantly and wearily, at an open portmanteau.\r\nA number of papers were lying upon it, which he had been meaning to\r\nlook over; some of them might conveniently be destroyed. But at last he\r\nshuffled them roughly together, and pushed them into a corner of the\r\nvalise; they were business papers, and he was in no humor for sifting\r\nthem. Then he drew forth his pocket-book and took out a paper of\r\nsmaller size than those he had dismissed. He did not unfold it; he\r\nsimply sat looking at the back of it. If he had momentarily entertained\r\nthe idea of destroying it, the idea quickly expired. What the paper\r\nsuggested was the feeling that lay in his innermost heart and that no\r\nreviving cheerfulness could long quench\xe2\x80\x94the feeling that after all and\r\nabove all he was a good fellow wronged. With it came a hearty hope that\r\nthe Bellegardes were enjoying their suspense as to what he would do\r\nyet. The more it was prolonged the more they would enjoy it! He had\r\nhung fire once, yes; perhaps, in his present queer state of mind, he\r\nmight hang fire again. But he restored the little paper to his\r\npocket-book very tenderly, and felt better for thinking of the suspense\r\nof the Bellegardes. He felt better every time he thought of it after\r\nthat, as he sailed the summer seas. He landed in New York and journeyed\r\nacross the continent to San Francisco, and nothing that he observed by\r\nthe way contributed to mitigate his sense of being a good fellow\r\nwronged.\r\n\r\nHe saw a great many other good fellows\xe2\x80\x94his old friends\xe2\x80\x94but he told none\r\nof them of the trick that had been played him. He said simply that the\r\nlady he was to have married had changed her mind, and when he was asked\r\nif he had changed his own, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cSuppose we change the subject.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\ntold his friends that he had brought home no \xe2\x80\x9cnew ideas\xe2\x80\x9d from Europe,\r\nand his conduct probably struck them as an eloquent proof of failing\r\ninvention. He took no interest in chatting about his affairs and\r\nmanifested no desire to look over his accounts. He asked half a dozen\r\nquestions which, like those of an eminent physician inquiring for\r\nparticular symptoms, showed that he still knew what he was talking\r\nabout; but he made no comments and gave no directions. He not only\r\npuzzled the gentlemen on the stock exchange, but he was himself\r\nsurprised at the extent of his indifference. As it seemed only to\r\nincrease, he made an effort to combat it; he tried to interest himself\r\nand to take up his old occupations. But they appeared unreal to him; do\r\nwhat he would he somehow could not believe in them. Sometimes he began\r\nto fear that there was something the matter with his head; that his\r\nbrain, perhaps, had softened, and that the end of his strong activities\r\nhad come. This idea came back to him with an exasperating force. A\r\nhopeless, helpless loafer, useful to no one and detestable to\r\nhimself\xe2\x80\x94this was what the treachery of the Bellegardes had made of him.\r\nIn his restless idleness he came back from San Francisco to New York,\r\nand sat for three days in the lobby of his hotel, looking out through a\r\nhuge wall of plate-glass at the unceasing stream of pretty girls in\r\nParisian-looking dresses, undulating past with little parcels nursed\r\nagainst their neat figures. At the end of three days he returned to San\r\nFrancisco, and having arrived there he wished he had stayed away. He\r\nhad nothing to do, his occupation was gone, and it seemed to him that\r\nhe should never find it again. He had nothing to do _here_, he\r\nsometimes said to himself; but there was something beyond the ocean\r\nthat he was still to do; something that he had left undone\r\nexperimentally and speculatively, to see if it could content itself to\r\nremain undone. But it was not content: it kept pulling at his\r\nheartstrings and thumping at his reason; it murmured in his ears and\r\nhovered perpetually before his eyes. It interposed between all new\r\nresolutions and their fulfillment; it seemed like a stubborn ghost,\r\ndumbly entreating to be laid. Till that was done he should never be\r\nable to do anything else.\r\n\r\nOne day, toward the end of the winter, after a long interval, he\r\nreceived a letter from Mrs. Tristram, who apparently was animated by a\r\ncharitable desire to amuse and distract her correspondent. She gave him\r\nmuch Paris gossip, talked of General Packard and Miss Kitty Upjohn,\r\nenumerated the new plays at the theatre, and enclosed a note from her\r\nhusband, who had gone down to spend a month at Nice. Then came her\r\nsignature, and after this her postscript. The latter consisted of these\r\nfew lines: \xe2\x80\x9cI heard three days since from my friend, the Abb\xc3\xa9 Aubert,\r\nthat Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9 last week took the veil at the Carmelites. It was\r\non her twenty-seventh birthday, and she took the name of her,\r\npatroness, St. Veronica. Sister Veronica has a lifetime before her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis letter came to Newman in the morning; in the evening he started\r\nfor Paris. His wound began to ache with its first fierceness, and\r\nduring his long bleak journey the thought of Madame de Cintr\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n\xe2\x80\x9clife-time,\xe2\x80\x9d passed within prison walls on whose outer side he might\r\nstand, kept him perpetual company. Now he would fix himself in Paris\r\nforever; he would extort a sort of happiness from the knowledge that if\r\nshe was not there, at least the stony sepulchre that held her was. He\r\ndescended, unannounced, upon Mrs. Bread, whom he found keeping lonely\r\nwatch in his great empty saloons on the Boulevard Haussmann. They were\r\nas neat as a Dutch village, Mrs. Bread\xe2\x80\x99s only occupation had been\r\nremoving individual dust-particles. She made no complaint, however, of\r\nher loneliness, for in her philosophy a servant was but a mysteriously\r\nprojected machine, and it would be as fantastic for a housekeeper to\r\ncomment upon a gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s absences as for a clock to remark upon not\r\nbeing wound up. No particular clock, Mrs. Bread supposed, went all the\r\ntime, and no particular servant could enjoy all the sunshine diffused\r\nby the career of an exacting master. She ventured, nevertheless, to\r\nexpress a modest hope that Newman meant to remain a while in Paris.\r\nNewman laid his hand on hers and shook it gently. \xe2\x80\x9cI mean to remain\r\nforever,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nHe went after this to see Mrs. Tristram, to whom he had telegraphed,\r\nand who expected him. She looked at him a moment and shook her head.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis won\xe2\x80\x99t do,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cyou have come back too soon.\xe2\x80\x9d He sat down\r\nand asked about her husband and her children, tried even to inquire\r\nabout Miss Dora Finch. In the midst of this\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know where she is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe asked, abruptly.\r\n\r\nMrs. Tristram hesitated a moment; of course he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t mean Miss Dora\r\nFinch. Then she answered, properly: \xe2\x80\x9cShe has gone to the other house\xe2\x80\x94in\r\nthe Rue d\xe2\x80\x99Enfer.\xe2\x80\x9d After Newman had sat a while longer looking very\r\nsombre, she went on: \xe2\x80\x9cYou are not so good a man as I thought. You are\r\nmore\xe2\x80\x94you are more\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore what?\xe2\x80\x9d Newman asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore unforgiving.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood God!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Newman; \xe2\x80\x9cdo you expect me to forgive?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not that. I have forgiven, so of course you can\xe2\x80\x99t. But you might\r\nforget! You have a worse temper about it than I should have expected.\r\nYou look wicked\xe2\x80\x94you look dangerous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI may be dangerous,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I am not wicked. No, I am not\r\nwicked.\xe2\x80\x9d And he got up to go. Mrs. Tristram asked him to come back to\r\ndinner; but he answered that he did not feel like pledging himself to\r\nbe present at an entertainment, even as a solitary guest. Later in the\r\nevening, if he should be able, he would come.\r\n\r\nHe walked away through the city, beside the Seine and over it, and took\r\nthe direction of the Rue d\xe2\x80\x99Enfer. The day had the softness of early\r\nspring; but the weather was gray and humid. Newman found himself in a\r\npart of Paris which he little knew\xe2\x80\x94a region of convents and prisons, of\r\nstreets bordered by long dead walls and traversed by a few wayfarers.\r\nAt the intersection of two of these streets stood the house of the\r\nCarmelites\xe2\x80\x94a dull, plain edifice, with a high-shouldered blank wall all\r\nround it. From without Newman could see its upper windows, its steep\r\nroof and its chimneys. But these things revealed no symptoms of human\r\nlife; the place looked dumb, deaf, inanimate. The pale, dead,\r\ndiscolored wall stretched beneath it, far down the empty side street\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nvista without a human figure. Newman stood there a long time; there\r\nwere no passers; he was free to gaze his fill. This seemed the goal of\r\nhis journey; it was what he had come for. It was a strange\r\nsatisfaction, and yet it was a satisfaction; the barren stillness of\r\nthe place seemed to be his own release from ineffectual longing. It\r\ntold him that the woman within was lost beyond recall, and that the\r\ndays and years of the future would pile themselves above her like the\r\nhuge immovable slab of a tomb. These days and years, in this place,\r\nwould always be just so gray and silent. Suddenly, from the thought of\r\ntheir seeing him stand there, again the charm utterly departed. He\r\nwould never stand there again; it was gratuitous dreariness. He turned\r\naway with a heavy heart, but with a heart lighter than the one he had\r\nbrought. Everything was over, and he too at last could rest. He walked\r\ndown through narrow, winding streets to the edge of the Seine again,\r\nand there he saw, close above him, the soft, vast towers of Notre Dame.\r\nHe crossed one of the bridges and stood a moment in the empty place\r\nbefore the great cathedral; then he went in beneath the grossly-imaged\r\nportals. He wandered some distance up the nave and sat down in the\r\nsplendid dimness. He sat a long time; he heard far-away bells chiming\r\noff, at long intervals, to the rest of the world. He was very tired;\r\nthis was the best place he could be in. He said no prayers; he had no\r\nprayers to say. He had nothing to be thankful for, and he had nothing\r\nto ask; nothing to ask, because now he must take care of himself. But a\r\ngreat cathedral offers a very various hospitality, and Newman sat in\r\nhis place, because while he was there he was out of the world. The most\r\nunpleasant thing that had ever happened to him had reached its formal\r\nconclusion, as it were; he could close the book and put it away. He\r\nleaned his head for a long time on the chair in front of him; when he\r\ntook it up he felt that he was himself again. Somewhere in his mind, a\r\ntight knot seemed to have loosened. He thought of the Bellegardes; he\r\nhad almost forgotten them. He remembered them as people he had meant to\r\ndo something to. He gave a groan as he remembered what he had meant to\r\ndo; he was annoyed at having meant to do it; the bottom, suddenly, had\r\nfallen out of his revenge. Whether it was Christian charity or\r\nunregenerate good nature\xe2\x80\x94what it was, in the background of his soul\xe2\x80\x94I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t pretend to say; but Newman\xe2\x80\x99s last thought was that of course he\r\nwould let the Bellegardes go.\r\n\r\nIf he had spoken it aloud he would have said that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to\r\nhurt them. He was ashamed of having wanted to hurt them. They had hurt\r\nhim, but such things were really not his game. At last he got up and\r\ncame out of the darkening church; not with the elastic step of a man\r\nwho had won a victory or taken a resolve, but strolling soberly, like a\r\ngood-natured man who is still a little ashamed.\r\n\r\nGoing home, he said to Mrs. Bread that he must trouble her to put back\r\nhis things into the portmanteau she had unpacked the evening before.\r\nHis gentle stewardess looked at him through eyes a trifle bedimmed.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear me, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cI thought you said that you were going\r\nto stay forever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI meant that I was going to stay away forever,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman kindly.\r\nAnd since his departure from Paris on the following day he has\r\ncertainly not returned. The gilded apartments I have so often spoken of\r\nstand ready to receive him; but they serve only as a spacious residence\r\nfor Mrs. Bread, who wanders eternally from room to room, adjusting the\r\ntassels of the curtains, and keeps her wages, which are regularly\r\nbrought her by a banker\xe2\x80\x99s clerk, in a great pink S\xc3\xa8vres vase on the\r\ndrawing-room mantelshelf.\r\n\r\nLate in the evening Newman went to Mrs. Tristram\xe2\x80\x99s and found Tom\r\nTristram by the domestic fireside. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad to see you back in Paris,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nthis gentleman declared. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know it\xe2\x80\x99s really the only place for a\r\nwhite man to live.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Tristram made his friend welcome, according to\r\nhis own rosy light, and offered him a convenient _r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9_ of the\r\nFranco-American gossip of the last six months. Then at last he got up\r\nand said he would go for half an hour to the club. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose a man who\r\nhas been for six months in California wants a little intellectual\r\nconversation. I\xe2\x80\x99ll let my wife have a go at you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman shook hands heartily with his host, but did not ask him to\r\nremain; and then he relapsed into his place on the sofa, opposite to\r\nMrs. Tristram. She presently asked him what he had done after leaving\r\nher. \xe2\x80\x9cNothing particular,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou struck me,\xe2\x80\x9d she rejoined, \xe2\x80\x9cas a man with a plot in his head. You\r\nlooked as if you were bent on some sinister errand, and after you had\r\nleft me I wondered whether I ought to have let you go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI only went over to the other side of the river\xe2\x80\x94to the Carmelites,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Newman.\r\n\r\nMrs. Tristram looked at him a moment and smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you do\r\nthere? Try to scale the wall?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did nothing. I looked at the place for a few minutes and then came\r\naway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Tristram gave him a sympathetic glance. \xe2\x80\x9cYou didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen to meet\r\nM. de Bellegarde,\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, \xe2\x80\x9cstaring hopelessly at the convent wall\r\nas well? I am told he takes his sister\xe2\x80\x99s conduct very hard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t meet him, I am happy to say,\xe2\x80\x9d Newman answered, after a\r\npause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are in the country,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Tristram went on; \xe2\x80\x9cat\xe2\x80\x94what is the name\r\nof the place?\xe2\x80\x94Fleuri\xc3\xa8res. They returned there at the time you left\r\nParis and have been spending the year in extreme seclusion. The little\r\nmarquise must enjoy it; I expect to hear that she has eloped with her\r\ndaughter\xe2\x80\x99s music-master!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman was looking at the light wood-fire; but he listened to this with\r\nextreme interest. At last he spoke: \xe2\x80\x9cI mean never to mention the name\r\nof those people again, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to hear anything more about\r\nthem.\xe2\x80\x9d And then he took out his pocket-book and drew forth a scrap of\r\npaper. He looked at it an instant, then got up and stood by the fire.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going to burn them up,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI am glad to have you as a\r\nwitness. There they go!\xe2\x80\x9d And he tossed the paper into the flame.\r\n\r\nMrs. Tristram sat with her embroidery needle suspended. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is that\r\npaper?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\nNewman leaning against the fireplace, stretched his arms and drew a\r\nlonger breath than usual. Then after a moment, \xe2\x80\x9cI can tell you now,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a paper containing a secret of the Bellegardes\xe2\x80\x94something\r\nwhich would damn them if it were known.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Tristram dropped her embroidery with a reproachful moan. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, why\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t you show it to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought of showing it to you\xe2\x80\x94I thought of showing it to everyone. I\r\nthought of paying my debt to the Bellegardes that way. So I told them,\r\nand I frightened them. They have been staying in the country as you\r\ntell me, to keep out of the explosion. But I have given it up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Tristram began to take slow stitches again. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you quite given\r\nit up?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it very bad, this secret?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, very bad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor myself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Tristram, \xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry you have given it up. I\r\nshould have liked immensely to see your paper. They have wronged me\r\ntoo, you know, as your sponsor and guarantee, and it would have served\r\nfor my revenge as well. How did you come into possession of your\r\nsecret?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a long story. But honestly, at any rate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd they knew you were master of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I told them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear me, how interesting!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs. Tristram. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you humbled them\r\nat your feet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman was silent a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, not at all. They pretended not to\r\ncare\xe2\x80\x94not to be afraid. But I know they did care\xe2\x80\x94they were afraid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you very sure?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman stared a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Tristram resumed her slow stitches. \xe2\x80\x9cThey defied you, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newman, \xe2\x80\x9cit was about that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou tried by the threat of exposure to make them retract?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs.\r\nTristram pursued.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. I gave them their choice, and they chose to\r\ntake their chance of bluffing off the charge and convicting me of\r\nfraud. But they _were_ frightened,\xe2\x80\x9d Newman added, \xe2\x80\x9cand I have had all\r\nthe vengeance I want.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is most provoking,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Tristram, \xe2\x80\x9cto hear you talk of the\r\n\xe2\x80\x98charge\xe2\x80\x99 when the charge is burnt up. Is it quite consumed?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked,\r\nglancing at the fire.\r\n\r\nNewman assured her that there was nothing left of it. \xe2\x80\x9cWell then,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose there is no harm in saying that you probably did not\r\nmake them so very uncomfortable. My impression would be that since, as\r\nyou say, they defied you, it was because they believed that, after all,\r\nyou would never really come to the point. Their confidence, after\r\ncounsel taken of each other, was not in their innocence, nor in their\r\ntalent for bluffing things off; it was in your remarkable good nature!\r\nYou see they were right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewman instinctively turned to see if the little paper was in fact\r\nconsumed; but there was nothing left of it.\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE AMERICAN ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 177-0.txt or 177-0.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n    https://www.gutenberg.org/1/7/177/\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\r\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\'s website\r\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
