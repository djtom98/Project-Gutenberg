About ten; that is exactly like Olive. Neither five nor fifteen,\r\nand yet not ten exactly, but either nine or eleven. She didn\'t tell me\r\nto say she was glad to see you, because she doesn\'t know whether she is\r\nor not, and she wouldn\'t for the world expose herself to telling a fib.\r\nShe is very honest, is Olive Chancellor; she is full of rectitude.\r\nNobody tells fibs in Boston; I don\'t know what to make of them all.\r\nWell, I am very glad to see you, at any rate."\r\n\r\nThese words were spoken with much volubility by a fair, plump, smiling\r\nwoman who entered a narrow drawing-room in which a visitor, kept waiting\r\nfor a few moments, was already absorbed in a book. The gentleman had not\r\neven needed to sit down to become interested: apparently he had taken up\r\nthe volume from a table as soon as he came in, and, standing there,\r\nafter a single glance round the apartment, had lost himself in its\r\npages. He threw it down at the approach of Mrs. Luna, laughed, shook\r\nhands with her, and said in answer to her last remark, "You imply that\r\nyou do tell fibs. Perhaps that is one."\r\n\r\n"Oh no; there is nothing wonderful in my being glad to see you," Mrs.\r\nLuna rejoined, "when I tell you that I have been three long weeks in\r\nthis unprevaricating city."\r\n\r\n"That has an unflattering sound for me," said the young man. "I pretend\r\nnot to prevaricate."\r\n\r\n"Dear me, what\'s the good of being a Southerner?" the lady asked. "Olive\r\ntold me to tell you she hoped you will stay to dinner. And if she said\r\nit, she does really hope it. She is willing to risk that."\r\n\r\n"Just as I am?" the visitor inquired, presenting himself with rather a\r\nwork-a-day aspect.\r\n\r\nMrs. Luna glanced at him from head to foot, and gave a little smiling\r\nsigh, as if he had been a long sum in addition. And, indeed, he was very\r\nlong, Basil Ransom, and he even looked a little hard and discouraging,\r\nlike a column of figures, in spite of the friendly face which he bent\r\nupon his hostess\'s deputy, and which, in its thinness, had a deep dry\r\nline, a sort of premature wrinkle, on either side of the mouth. He was\r\ntall and lean, and dressed throughout in black; his shirt-collar was low\r\nand wide, and the triangle of linen, a little crumpled, exhibited by the\r\nopening of his waistcoat, was adorned by a pin containing a small red\r\nstone. In spite of this decoration the young man looked poor--as poor as\r\na young man could look who had such a fine head and such magnificent\r\neyes. Those of Basil Ransom were dark, deep, and glowing; his head had a\r\ncharacter of elevation which fairly added to his stature; it was a head\r\nto be seen above the level of a crowd, on some judicial bench or\r\npolitical platform, or even on a bronze medal. His forehead was high and\r\nbroad, and his thick black hair, perfectly straight and glossy, and\r\nwithout any division, rolled back from it in a leonine manner. These\r\nthings, the eyes especially, with their smouldering fire, might have\r\nindicated that he was to be a great American statesman; or, on the other\r\nhand, they might simply have proved that he came from Carolina or\r\nAlabama. He came, in fact, from Mississippi, and he spoke very\r\nperceptibly with the accent of that country. It is not in my power to\r\nreproduce by any combination of characters this charming dialect; but\r\nthe initiated reader will have no difficulty in evoking the sound, which\r\nis to be associated in the present instance with nothing vulgar or vain.\r\nThis lean, pale, sallow, shabby, striking young man, with his superior\r\nhead, his sedentary shoulders, his expression of bright grimness and\r\nhard enthusiasm, his provincial, distinguished appearance, is, as a\r\nrepresentative of his sex, the most important personage in my narrative;\r\nhe played a very active part in the events I have undertaken in some\r\ndegree to set forth. And yet the reader who likes a complete image, who\r\ndesires to read with the senses as well as with the reason, is entreated\r\nnot to forget that he prolonged his consonants and swallowed his vowels,\r\nthat he was guilty of elisions and interpolations which were equally\r\nunexpected, and that his discourse was pervaded by something sultry and\r\nvast, something almost African in its rich, basking tone, something that\r\nsuggested the teeming expanse of the cotton-field. Mrs. Luna looked up\r\nat all this, but saw only a part of it; otherwise she would not have\r\nreplied in a bantering manner, in answer to his inquiry: "Are you ever\r\ndifferent from this?" Mrs. Luna was familiar--intolerably familiar.\r\n\r\nBasil Ransom coloured a little. Then he said: "Oh yes; when I dine out I\r\nusually carry a six-shooter and a bowie-knife." And he took up his hat\r\nvaguely--a soft black hat with a low crown and an immense straight brim.\r\nMrs. Luna wanted to know what he was doing. She made him sit down; she\r\nassured him that her sister quite expected him, would feel as sorry as\r\nshe could ever feel for anything--for she was a kind of fatalist,\r\nanyhow--if he didn\'t stay to dinner. It was an immense pity--she herself\r\nwas going out; in Boston you must jump at invitations. Olive, too, was\r\ngoing somewhere after dinner, but he mustn\'t mind that; perhaps he would\r\nlike to go with her. It wasn\'t a party--Olive didn\'t go to parties; it\r\nwas one of those weird meetings she was so fond of.\r\n\r\n"What kind of meetings do you refer to? You speak as if it were a\r\nrendezvous of witches on the Brocken."\r\n\r\n"Well, so it is; they are all witches and wizards, mediums, and\r\nspirit-rappers, and roaring radicals."\r\n\r\nBasil Ransom stared; the yellow light in his brown eyes deepened. "Do\r\nyou mean to say your sister\'s a roaring radical?"\r\n\r\n"A radical? She\'s a female Jacobin--she\'s a nihilist. Whatever is, is\r\nwrong, and all that sort of thing. If you are going to dine with her,\r\nyou had better know it."\r\n\r\n"Oh, murder!" murmured the young man vaguely, sinking back in his chair\r\nwith his arms folded. He looked at Mrs. Luna with intelligent\r\nincredulity. She was sufficiently pretty; her hair was in clusters of\r\ncurls, like bunches of grapes; her tight bodice seemed to crack with her\r\nvivacity; and from beneath the stiff little plaits of her petticoat a\r\nsmall fat foot protruded, resting upon a stilted heel. She was\r\nattractive and impertinent, especially the latter. He seemed to think it\r\nwas a great pity, what she had told him; but he lost himself in this\r\nconsideration, or, at any rate, said nothing for some time, while his\r\neyes wandered over Mrs. Luna, and he probably wondered what body of\r\ndoctrine _she_ represented, little as she might partake of the nature of\r\nher sister. Many things were strange to Basil Ransom; Boston especially\r\nwas strewn with surprises, and he was a man who liked to understand.\r\nMrs. Luna was drawing on her gloves; Ransom had never seen any that were\r\nso long; they reminded him of stockings, and he wondered how she managed\r\nwithout garters above the elbow. "Well, I suppose I might have known\r\nthat," he continued, at last.\r\n\r\n"You might have known what?"\r\n\r\n"Well, that Miss Chancellor would be all that you say. She was brought\r\nup in the city of reform."\r\n\r\n"Oh, it isn\'t the city; it\'s just Olive Chancellor. She would reform the\r\nsolar system if she could get hold of it. She\'ll reform you, if you\r\ndon\'t look out. That\'s the way I found her when I returned from Europe."\r\n\r\n"Have you been in Europe?" Ransom asked.\r\n\r\n"Mercy, yes! Haven\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"No, I haven\'t been anywhere. Has your sister?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; but she stayed only an hour or two. She hates it; she would like\r\nto abolish it. Didn\'t you know I had been to Europe?" Mrs. Luna went on,\r\nin the slightly aggrieved tone of a woman who discovers the limits of\r\nher reputation.\r\n\r\nRansom reflected he might answer her that until five minutes ago he\r\ndidn\'t know she existed; but he remembered that this was not the way in\r\nwhich a Southern gentleman spoke to ladies, and he contented himself\r\nwith saying that he must condone his Boeotian ignorance (he was fond\r\nof an elegant phrase); that he lived in a part of the country where they\r\ndidn\'t think much about Europe, and that he had always supposed she was\r\ndomiciled in New York. This last remark he made at a venture, for he\r\nhad, naturally, not devoted any supposition whatever to Mrs. Luna. His\r\ndishonesty, however, only exposed him the more.\r\n\r\n"If you thought I lived in New York, why in the world didn\'t you come\r\nand see me?" the lady inquired.\r\n\r\n"Well, you see, I don\'t go out much, except to the courts."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean the law-courts? Every one has got some profession over\r\nhere! Are you very ambitious? You look as if you were."\r\n\r\n"Yes, very," Basil Ransom replied, with a smile, and the curious\r\nfeminine softness with which Southern gentlemen enunciate that adverb.\r\n\r\nMrs. Luna explained that she had been living in Europe for several\r\nyears--ever since her husband died--but had come home a month before,\r\ncome home with her little boy, the only thing she had in the world, and\r\nwas paying a visit to her sister, who, of course, was the nearest thing\r\nafter the child. "But it isn\'t the same," she said. "Olive and I\r\ndisagree so much."\r\n\r\n"While you and your little boy don\'t," the young man remarked.\r\n\r\n"Oh no, I never differ from Newton!" And Mrs. Luna added that now she\r\nwas back she didn\'t know what she should do. That was the worst of\r\ncoming back; it was like being born again, at one\'s age--one had to\r\nbegin life afresh. One didn\'t even know what one had come back for.\r\nThere were people who wanted one to spend the winter in Boston; but she\r\ncouldn\'t stand that--she knew, at least, what she had not come back for.\r\nPerhaps she should take a house in Washington; did he ever hear of that\r\nlittle place? They had invented it while she was away. Besides, Olive\r\ndidn\'t want her in Boston, and didn\'t go through the form of saying so.\r\nThat was one comfort with Olive; she never went through any forms.\r\n\r\nBasil Ransom had got up just as Mrs. Luna made this last declaration;\r\nfor a young lady had glided into the room, who stopped short as it fell\r\nupon her ears. She stood there looking, consciously and rather\r\nseriously, at Mr. Ransom; a smile of exceeding faintness played about\r\nher lips--it was just perceptible enough to light up the native gravity\r\nof her face. It might have been likened to a thin ray of moonlight\r\nresting upon the wall of a prison.\r\n\r\n"If that were true," she said, "I shouldn\'t tell you that I am very\r\nsorry to have kept you waiting."\r\n\r\nHer voice was low and agreeable--a cultivated voice--and she extended a\r\nslender white hand to her visitor, who remarked with some solemnity (he\r\nfelt a certain guilt of participation in Mrs. Luna\'s indiscretion) that\r\nhe was intensely happy to make her acquaintance. He observed that Miss\r\nChancellor\'s hand was at once cold and limp; she merely placed it in\r\nhis, without exerting the smallest pressure. Mrs. Luna explained to her\r\nsister that her freedom of speech was caused by his being a\r\nrelation--though, indeed, he didn\'t seem to know much about them. She\r\ndidn\'t believe he had ever heard of her, Mrs. Luna, though he pretended,\r\nwith his Southern chivalry, that he had. She must be off to her dinner\r\nnow, she saw the carriage was there, and in her absence Olive might give\r\nany version of her she chose.\r\n\r\n"I have told him you are a radical, and you may tell him, if you like,\r\nthat I am a painted Jezebel. Try to reform him; a person from\r\nMississippi is sure to be all wrong. I shall be back very late; we are\r\ngoing to a theatre-party; that\'s why we dine so early. Good-bye, Mr.\r\nRansom," Mrs. Luna continued, gathering up the feathery white shawl\r\nwhich added to the volume of her fairness. "I hope you are going to stay\r\na little, so that you may judge us for yourself. I should like you to\r\nsee Newton, too; he is a noble little nature, and I want some advice\r\nabout him. You only stay to-morrow? Why, what\'s the use of that? Well,\r\nmind you come and see me in New York; I shall be sure to be part of the\r\nwinter there. I shall send you a card; I won\'t let you off. Don\'t come\r\nout; my sister has the first claim. Olive, why don\'t you take him to\r\nyour female convention?" Mrs. Luna\'s familiarity extended even to her\r\nsister; she remarked to Miss Chancellor that she looked as if she were\r\ngot up for a sea-voyage. "I am glad I haven\'t opinions that prevent my\r\ndressing in the evening!" she declared from the doorway. "The amount of\r\nthought they give to their clothing, the people who are afraid of\r\nlooking frivolous!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nWhether much or little consideration had been directed to the result,\r\nMiss Chancellor certainly would not have incurred this reproach. She was\r\nhabited in a plain dark dress, without any ornaments, and her smooth,\r\ncolourless hair was confined as carefully as that of her sister was\r\nencouraged to stray. She had instantly seated herself, and while Mrs.\r\nLuna talked she kept her eyes on the ground, glancing even less toward\r\nBasil Ransom than toward that woman of many words. The young man was\r\ntherefore free to look at her; a contemplation which showed him that she\r\nwas agitated and trying to conceal it. He wondered why she was agitated,\r\nnot foreseeing that he was destined to discover, later, that her nature\r\nwas like a skiff in a stormy sea. Even after her sister had passed out\r\nof the room she sat there with her eyes turned away, as if there had\r\nbeen a spell upon her which forbade her to raise them. Miss Olive\r\nChancellor, it may be confided to the reader, to whom in the course of\r\nour history I shall be under the necessity of imparting much occult\r\ninformation, was subject to fits of tragic shyness, during which she was\r\nunable to meet even her own eyes in the mirror. One of these fits had\r\nsuddenly seized her now, without any obvious cause, though, indeed, Mrs.\r\nLuna had made it worse by becoming instantly so personal. There was\r\nnothing in the world so personal as Mrs. Luna; her sister could have\r\nhated her for it if she had not forbidden herself this emotion as\r\ndirected to individuals. Basil Ransom was a young man of first-rate\r\nintelligence, but conscious of the narrow range, as yet, of his\r\nexperience. He was on his guard against generalisations which might be\r\nhasty; but he had arrived at two or three that were of value to a\r\ngentleman lately admitted to the New York bar and looking out for\r\nclients. One of them was to the effect that the simplest division it is\r\npossible to make of the human race is into the people who take things\r\nhard and the people who take them easy. He perceived very quickly that\r\nMiss Chancellor belonged to the former class. This was written so\r\nintensely in her delicate face that he felt an unformulated pity for her\r\nbefore they had exchanged twenty words. He himself, by nature, took\r\nthings easy; if he had put on the screw of late, it was after reflexion,\r\nand because circumstances pressed him close. But this pale girl, with\r\nher light-green eyes, her pointed features and nervous manner, was\r\nvisibly morbid; it was as plain as day that she was morbid. Poor Ransom\r\nannounced this fact to himself as if he had made a great discovery; but\r\nin reality he had never been so "Boeotian" as at that moment. It proved\r\nnothing of any importance, with regard to Miss Chancellor, to say that\r\nshe was morbid; any sufficient account of her would lie very much to the\r\nrear of that. Why was she morbid, and why was her morbidness typical?\r\nRansom might have exulted if he had gone back far enough to explain that\r\nmystery. The women he had hitherto known had been mainly of his own soft\r\nclime, and it was not often they exhibited the tendency he detected (and\r\ncursorily deplored) in Mrs. Luna\'s sister. That was the way he liked\r\nthem--not to think too much, not to feel any responsibility for the\r\ngovernment of the world, such as he was sure Miss Chancellor felt. If\r\nthey would only be private and passive, and have no feeling but for\r\nthat, and leave publicity to the sex of tougher hide! Ransom was pleased\r\nwith the vision of that remedy; it must be repeated that he was very\r\nprovincial.\r\n\r\nThese considerations were not present to him as definitely as I have\r\nwritten them here; they were summed up in the vague compassion which his\r\ncousin\'s figure excited in his mind, and which was yet accompanied with\r\na sensible reluctance to know her better, obvious as it was that with\r\nsuch a face as that she must be remarkable. He was sorry for her, but he\r\nsaw in a flash that no one could help her: that was what made her\r\ntragic. He had not, seeking his fortune, come away from the blighted\r\nSouth, which weighed upon his heart, to look out for tragedies; at least\r\nhe didn\'t want them outside of his office in Pine Street. He broke the\r\nsilence ensuing upon Mrs. Luna\'s departure by one of the courteous\r\nspeeches to which blighted regions may still encourage a tendency, and\r\npresently found himself talking comfortably enough with his hostess.\r\nThough he had said to himself that no one could help her, the effect of\r\nhis tone was to dispel her shyness; it was her great advantage (for the\r\ncareer she had proposed to herself) that in certain conditions she was\r\nliable suddenly to become bold. She was reassured at finding that her\r\nvisitor was peculiar; the way he spoke told her that it was no wonder he\r\nhad fought on the Southern side. She had never yet encountered a\r\npersonage so exotic, and she always felt more at her ease in the\r\npresence of anything strange. It was the usual things of life that\r\nfilled her with silent rage; which was natural enough, inasmuch as, to\r\nher vision, almost everything that was usual was iniquitous. She had no\r\ndifficulty in asking him now whether he would not stay to dinner--she\r\nhoped Adeline had given him her message. It had been when she was\r\nupstairs with Adeline, as his card was brought up, a sudden and very\r\nabnormal inspiration to offer him this (for her) really ultimate favour;\r\nnothing could be further from her common habit than to entertain alone,\r\nat any repast, a gentleman she had never seen.\r\n\r\nIt was the same sort of impulse that had moved her to write to Basil\r\nRansom, in the spring, after hearing accidentally that he had come to\r\nthe North and intended, in New York, to practise his profession. It was\r\nher nature to look out for duties, to appeal to her conscience for\r\ntasks. This attentive organ, earnestly consulted, had represented to her\r\nthat he was an offshoot of the old slave-holding oligarchy which, within\r\nher own vivid remembrance, had plunged the country into blood and tears,\r\nand that, as associated with such abominations, he was not a worthy\r\nobject of patronage for a person whose two brothers--her only ones--had\r\ngiven up life for the Northern cause. It reminded her, however, on the\r\nother hand, that he too had been much bereaved, and, moreover, that he\r\nhad fought and offered his own life, even if it had not been taken. She\r\ncould not defend herself against a rich admiration--a kind of tenderness\r\nof envy--of any one who had been so happy as to have that opportunity.\r\nThe most secret, the most sacred hope of her nature was that she might\r\nsome day have such a chance, that she might be a martyr and die for\r\nsomething. Basil Ransom had lived, but she knew he had lived to see\r\nbitter hours. His family was ruined; they had lost their slaves, their\r\nproperty, their friends and relations, their home; had tasted of all the\r\ncruelty of defeat. He had tried for a while to carry on the plantation\r\nhimself, but he had a millstone of debt round his neck, and he longed\r\nfor some work which would transport him to the haunts of men. The State\r\nof Mississippi seemed to him the state of despair; so he surrendered the\r\nremnants of his patrimony to his mother and sisters, and, at nearly\r\nthirty years of age, alighted for the first time in New York, in the\r\ncostume of his province, with fifty dollars in his pocket and a gnawing\r\nhunger in his heart.\r\n\r\nThat this incident had revealed to the young man his ignorance of many\r\nthings--only, however, to make him say to himself, after the first angry\r\nblush, that here he would enter the game and here he would win it--so\r\nmuch Olive Chancellor could not know; what was sufficient for her was\r\nthat he had rallied, as the French say, had accepted the accomplished\r\nfact, had admitted that North and South were a single, indivisible\r\npolitical organism. Their cousinship--that of Chancellors and\r\nRansoms--was not very close; it was the kind of thing that one might\r\ntake up or leave alone, as one pleased. It was "in the female line," as\r\nBasil Ransom had written, in answering her letter with a good deal of\r\nform and flourish; he spoke as if they had been royal houses. Her mother\r\nhad wished to take it up; it was only the fear of seeming patronising to\r\npeople in misfortune that had prevented her from writing to Mississippi.\r\nIf it had been possible to send Mrs. Ransom money, or even clothes, she\r\nwould have liked that; but she had no means of ascertaining how such an\r\noffering would be taken. By the time Basil came to the North--making\r\nadvances, as it were--Mrs. Chancellor had passed away; so it was for\r\nOlive, left alone in the little house in Charles Street (Adeline being\r\nin Europe), to decide.\r\n\r\nShe knew what her mother would have done, and that helped her decision;\r\nfor her mother always chose the positive course. Olive had a fear of\r\neverything, but her greatest fear was of being afraid. She wished\r\nimmensely to be generous, and how could one be generous unless one ran a\r\nrisk? She had erected it into a sort of rule of conduct that whenever\r\nshe saw a risk she was to take it; and she had frequent humiliations at\r\nfinding herself safe after all. She was perfectly safe after writing to\r\nBasil Ransom; and, indeed, it was difficult to see what he could have\r\ndone to her except thank her (he was only exceptionally superlative) for\r\nher letter, and assure her that he would come and see her the first time\r\nhis business (he was beginning to get a little) should take him to\r\nBoston. He had now come, in redemption of his grateful vow, and even\r\nthis did not make Miss Chancellor feel that she had courted danger. She\r\nsaw (when once she had looked at him) that he would not put those\r\nworldly interpretations on things which, with her, it was both an\r\nimpulse and a principle to defy. He was too simple--too\r\nMississippian--for that; she was almost disappointed. She certainly had\r\nnot hoped that she might have struck him as making unwomanly overtures\r\n(Miss Chancellor hated this epithet almost as much as she hated its\r\nopposite); but she had a presentiment that he would be too good-natured,\r\nprimitive to that degree. Of all things in the world, contention was\r\nmost sweet to her (though why it is hard to imagine, for it always cost\r\nher tears, headaches, a day or two in bed, acute emotion), and it was\r\nvery possible Basil Ransom would not care to contend. Nothing could be\r\nmore displeasing than this indifference when people didn\'t agree with\r\nyou. That he should agree she did not in the least expect of him; how\r\ncould a Mississippian agree? If she had supposed he would agree, she\r\nwould not have written to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen he had told her that if she would take him as he was he should be\r\nvery happy to dine with her, she excused herself a moment and went to\r\ngive an order in the dining-room. The young man, left alone, looked\r\nabout the parlour--the two parlours which, in their prolonged, adjacent\r\nnarrowness, formed evidently one apartment--and wandered to the windows\r\nat the back, where there was a view of the water; Miss Chancellor having\r\nthe good fortune to dwell on that side of Charles Street toward which,\r\nin the rear, the afternoon sun slants redly, from an horizon indented at\r\nempty intervals with wooden spires, the masts of lonely boats, the\r\nchimneys of dirty "works," over a brackish expanse of anomalous\r\ncharacter, which is too big for a river and too small for a bay. The\r\nview seemed to him very picturesque, though in the gathered dusk little\r\nwas left of it save a cold yellow streak in the west, a gleam of brown\r\nwater, and the reflexion of the lights that had begun to show themselves\r\nin a row of houses, impressive to Ransom in their extreme modernness,\r\nwhich overlooked the same lagoon from a long embankment on the left,\r\nconstructed of stones roughly piled. He thought this prospect, from a\r\ncity-house, almost romantic; and he turned from it back to the interior\r\nilluminated now by a lamp which the parlour-maid had placed on a table\r\nwhile he stood at the window as to something still more genial and\r\ninteresting. The artistic sense in Basil Ransom had not been highly\r\ncultivated; neither (though he had passed his early years as the son of\r\na rich man) was his conception of material comfort very definite; it\r\nconsisted mainly of the vision of plenty of cigars and brandy and water\r\nand newspapers, and a cane-bottomed arm-chair of the right inclination,\r\nfrom which he could stretch his legs. Nevertheless it seemed to him he\r\nhad never seen an interior that was so much an interior as this queer\r\ncorridor-shaped drawing-room of his new-found kinswoman; he had never\r\nfelt himself in the presence of so much organised privacy or of so many\r\nobjects that spoke of habits and tastes. Most of the people he had\r\nhitherto known had no tastes; they had a few habits, but these were not\r\nof a sort that required much upholstery. He had not as yet been in many\r\nhouses in New York, and he had never before seen so many accessories.\r\nThe general character of the place struck him as Bostonian; this was, in\r\nfact, very much what he had supposed Boston to be. He had always heard\r\nBoston was a city of culture, and now there was culture in Miss\r\nChancellor\'s tables and sofas, in the books that were everywhere, on\r\nlittle shelves like brackets (as if a book were a statuette), in the\r\nphotographs and watercolours that covered the walls, in the curtains\r\nthat were festooned rather stiffly in the doorways. He looked at some of\r\nthe books and saw that his cousin read German; and his impression of the\r\nimportance of this (as a symptom of superiority) was not diminished by\r\nthe fact that he himself had mastered the tongue (knowing it contained a\r\nlarge literature of jurisprudence) during a long, empty, deadly summer\r\non the plantation. It is a curious proof of a certain crude modesty\r\ninherent in Basil Ransom that the main effect of his observing his\r\ncousin\'s German books was to give him an idea of the natural energy of\r\nNortherners. He had noticed it often before; he had already told himself\r\nthat he must count with it. It was only after much experience he made\r\nthe discovery that few Northerners were, in their secret soul, so\r\nenergetic as he. Many other persons had made it before that. He knew\r\nvery little about Miss Chancellor; he had come to see her only because\r\nshe wrote to him; he would never have thought of looking her up, and\r\nsince then there had been no one in New York he might ask about her.\r\nTherefore he could only guess that she was a rich young woman; such a\r\nhouse, inhabited in such a way by a quiet spinster, implied a\r\nconsiderable income. How much? he asked himself; five thousand, ten\r\nthousand, fifteen thousand a year? There was richness to our panting\r\nyoung man in the smallest of these figures. He was not of a mercenary\r\nspirit, but he had an immense desire for success, and he had more than\r\nonce reflected that a moderate capital was an aid to achievement. He had\r\nseen in his younger years one of the biggest failures that history\r\ncommemorates, an immense national _fiasco_, and it had implanted in his\r\nmind a deep aversion to the ineffectual. It came over him, while he\r\nwaited for his hostess to reappear, that she was unmarried as well as\r\nrich, that she was sociable (her letter answered for that) as well as\r\nsingle; and he had for a moment a whimsical vision of becoming a partner\r\nin so flourishing a firm. He ground his teeth a little as he thought of\r\nthe contrasts of the human lot; this cushioned feminine nest made him\r\nfeel unhoused and underfed. Such a mood, however, could only be\r\nmomentary, for he was conscious at bottom of a bigger stomach than all\r\nthe culture of Charles Street could fill.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, when his cousin had come back and they had gone down to\r\ndinner together, where he sat facing her at a little table decorated in\r\nthe middle with flowers, a position from which he had another view,\r\nthrough a window where the curtain remained undrawn by her direction\r\n(she called his attention to this--it was for his benefit), of the\r\ndusky, empty river, spotted with points of light--at this period, I say,\r\nit was very easy for him to remark to himself that nothing would induce\r\nhim to make love to such a type as that. Several months later, in New\r\nYork, in conversation with Mrs. Luna, of whom he was destined to see a\r\ngood deal, he alluded by chance to this repast, to the way her sister\r\nhad placed him at table, and to the remark with which she had pointed\r\nout the advantage of his seat.\r\n\r\n"That\'s what they call in Boston being very \'thoughtful,\'" Mrs. Luna\r\nsaid, "giving you the Back Bay (don\'t you hate the name?) to look at,\r\nand then taking credit for it."\r\n\r\nThis, however, was in the future; what Basil Ransom actually perceived\r\nwas that Miss Chancellor was a signal old maid. That was her quality,\r\nher destiny; nothing could be more distinctly written. There are women\r\nwho are unmarried by accident, and others who are unmarried by option;\r\nbut Olive Chancellor was unmarried by every implication of her being.\r\nShe was a spinster as Shelley was a lyric poet, or as the month of\r\nAugust is sultry. She was so essentially a celibate that Ransom found\r\nhimself thinking of her as old, though when he came to look at her (as\r\nhe said to himself) it was apparent that her years were fewer than his\r\nown. He did not dislike her, she had been so friendly; but, little by\r\nlittle, she gave him an uneasy feeling--the sense that you could never\r\nbe safe with a person who took things so hard. It came over him that it\r\nwas because she took things hard she had sought his acquaintance; it had\r\nbeen because she was strenuous, not because she was genial; she had had\r\nin her eye--and what an extraordinary eye it was!--not a pleasure, but a\r\nduty. She would expect him to be strenuous in return; but he\r\ncouldn\'t--in private life, he couldn\'t; privacy for Basil Ransom\r\nconsisted entirely in what he called "laying off." She was not so plain\r\non further acquaintance as she had seemed to him at first; even the\r\nyoung Mississippian had culture enough to see that she was refined. Her\r\nwhite skin had a singular look of being drawn tightly across her face;\r\nbut her features, though sharp and irregular, were delicate in a fashion\r\nthat suggested good breeding. Their line was perverse, but it was not\r\npoor. The curious tint of her eyes was a living colour; when she turned\r\nit upon you, you thought vaguely of the glitter of green ice. She had\r\nabsolutely no figure, and presented a certain appearance of feeling\r\ncold. With all this, there was something very modern and highly\r\ndeveloped in her aspect; she had the advantages as well as the drawbacks\r\nof a nervous organisation. She smiled constantly at her guest, but from\r\nthe beginning to the end of dinner, though he made several remarks that\r\nhe thought might prove amusing, she never once laughed. Later, he saw\r\nthat she was a woman without laughter; exhilaration, if it ever visited\r\nher, was dumb. Once only, in the course of his subsequent acquaintance\r\nwith her, did it find a voice; and then the sound remained in Ransom\'s\r\near as one of the strangest he had heard.\r\n\r\nShe asked him a great many questions, and made no comment on his\r\nanswers, which only served to suggest to her fresh inquiries. Her\r\nshyness had quite left her, it did not come back; she had confidence\r\nenough to wish him to see that she took a great interest in him. Why\r\nshould she? he wondered, He couldn\'t believe he was one of _her_ kind;\r\nhe was conscious of much Bohemianism--he drank beer, in New York, in\r\ncellars, knew no ladies, and was familiar with a "variety" actress.\r\nCertainly, as she knew him better, she would disapprove of him, though,\r\nof course, he would never mention the actress, nor even, if necessary,\r\nthe beer. Ransom\'s conception of vice was purely as a series of special\r\ncases, of explicable accidents. Not that he cared; if it were a part of\r\nthe Boston character to be inquiring, he would be to the last a\r\ncourteous Mississippian. He would tell her about Mississippi as much as\r\nshe liked; he didn\'t care how much he told her that the old ideas in the\r\nSouth were played out. She would not understand him any the better for\r\nthat; she would not know how little his own views could be gathered from\r\nsuch a limited admission. What her sister imparted to him about her\r\nmania for "reform" had left in his mouth a kind of unpleasant\r\naftertaste; he felt, at any rate, that if she had the religion of\r\nhumanity--Basil Ransom had read Comte, he had read everything--she would\r\nnever understand him. He, too, had a private vision of reform, but the\r\nfirst principle of it was to reform the reformers. As they drew to the\r\nclose of a meal which, in spite of all latent incompatibilities, had\r\ngone off brilliantly, she said to him that she should have to leave him\r\nafter dinner, unless perhaps he should be inclined to accompany her. She\r\nwas going to a small gathering at the house of a friend who had asked a\r\nfew people, "interested in new ideas," to meet Mrs. Farrinder.\r\n\r\n"Oh, thank you," said Basil Ransom. "Is it a party? I haven\'t been to a\r\nparty since Mississippi seceded."\r\n\r\n"No; Miss Birdseye doesn\'t give parties. She\'s an ascetic."\r\n\r\n"Oh, well, we have had our dinner," Ransom rejoined, laughing.\r\n\r\nHis hostess sat silent a moment, with her eyes on the ground; she looked\r\nat such times as if she were hesitating greatly between several things\r\nshe might say, all so important that it was difficult to choose.\r\n\r\n"I think it might interest you," she remarked presently. "You will hear\r\nsome discussion, if you are fond of that. Perhaps you wouldn\'t agree,"\r\nshe added, resting her strange eyes on him.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps I shouldn\'t--I don\'t agree with everything," he said, smiling\r\nand stroking his leg.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you care for human progress?" Miss Chancellor went on.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know--I never saw any. Are you going to show me some?"\r\n\r\n"I can show you an earnest effort towards it. That\'s the most one can be\r\nsure of. But I am not sure you are worthy."\r\n\r\n"Is it something very Bostonian? I should like to see that," said Basil\r\nRansom.\r\n\r\n"There are movements in other cities. Mrs. Farrinder goes everywhere;\r\nshe may speak to-night."\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Farrinder, the celebrated----?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, the celebrated; the great apostle of the emancipation of women.\r\nShe is a great friend of Miss Birdseye."\r\n\r\n"And who is Miss Birdseye?"\r\n\r\n"She is one of our celebrities. She is the woman in the world, I\r\nsuppose, who has laboured most for every wise reform. I think I ought to\r\ntell you," Miss Chancellor went on in a moment, "she was one of the\r\nearliest, one of the most passionate, of the old Abolitionists."\r\n\r\nShe had thought, indeed, she ought to tell him that, and it threw her\r\ninto a little tremor of excitement to do so. Yet, if she had been afraid\r\nhe would show some irritation at this news, she was disappointed at the\r\ngeniality with which he exclaimed:\r\n\r\n"Why, poor old lady--she must be quite mature!"\r\n\r\nIt was therefore with some severity that she rejoined:\r\n\r\n"She will never be old. She is the youngest spirit I know. But if you\r\nare not in sympathy, perhaps you had better not come," she went on.\r\n\r\n"In sympathy with what, dear madam?" Basil Ransom asked, failing still,\r\nto her perception, to catch the tone of real seriousness. "If, as you\r\nsay, there is to be a discussion, there will be different sides, and of\r\ncourse one can\'t sympathise with both."\r\n\r\n"Yes, but every one will, in his way--or in her way--plead the cause of\r\nthe new truths. If you don\'t care for them, you won\'t go with us."\r\n\r\n"I tell you I haven\'t the least idea what they are! I have never yet\r\nencountered in the world any but old truths--as old as the sun and moon.\r\nHow can I know? But _do_ take me; it\'s such a chance to see Boston."\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t Boston--it\'s humanity!" Miss Chancellor, as she made this\r\nremark, rose from her chair, and her movement seemed to say that she\r\nconsented. But before she quitted her kinsman to get ready, she observed\r\nto him that she was sure he knew what she meant; he was only pretending\r\nhe didn\'t.\r\n\r\n"Well, perhaps, after all, I have a general idea," he confessed; "but\r\ndon\'t you see how this little reunion will give me a chance to fix it?"\r\n\r\nShe lingered an instant, with her anxious face. "Mrs. Farrinder will fix\r\nit!" she said; and she went to prepare herself.\r\n\r\nIt was in this poor young lady\'s nature to be anxious, to have scruple\r\nwithin scruple and to forecast the consequences of things. She returned\r\nin ten minutes, in her bonnet, which she had apparently assumed in\r\nrecognition of Miss Birdseye\'s asceticism. As she stood there drawing on\r\nher gloves--her visitor had fortified himself against Mrs. Farrinder by\r\nanother glass of wine--she declared to him that she quite repented of\r\nhaving proposed to him to go; something told her that he would be an\r\nunfavourable element.\r\n\r\n"Why, is it going to be a spiritual _s\xe9ance_?" Basil Ransom asked.\r\n\r\n"Well, I have heard at Miss Birdseye\'s some inspirational speaking."\r\nOlive Chancellor was determined to look him straight in the face as she\r\nsaid this; her sense of the way it might strike him operated as a\r\ncogent, not as a deterrent, reason.\r\n\r\n"Why, Miss Olive, it\'s just got up on purpose for me!" cried the young\r\nMississippian, radiant, and clasping his hands. She thought him very\r\nhandsome as he said this, but reflected that unfortunately men didn\'t\r\ncare for the truth, especially the new kinds, in proportion as they were\r\ngood-looking. She had, however, a moral resource that she could always\r\nfall back upon; it had already been a comfort to her, on occasions of\r\nacute feeling, that she hated men, as a class, anyway. "And I want so\r\nmuch to see an old Abolitionist; I have never laid eyes on one," Basil\r\nRansom added.\r\n\r\n"Of course you couldn\'t see one in the South; you were too afraid of\r\nthem to let them come there!" She was now trying to think of something\r\nshe might say that would be sufficiently disagreeable to make him cease\r\nto insist on accompanying her; for, strange to record--if anything, in a\r\nperson of that intense sensibility, be stranger than any other--her\r\nsecond thought with regard to having asked him had deepened with the\r\nelapsing moments into an unreasoned terror of the effect of his\r\npresence. "Perhaps Miss Birdseye won\'t like you," she went on, as they\r\nwaited for the carriage.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know; I reckon she will," said Basil Ransom good-humouredly. He\r\nevidently had no intention of giving up his opportunity.\r\n\r\nFrom the window of the dining-room, at that moment, they heard the\r\ncarriage drive up. Miss Birdseye lived at the South End; the distance\r\nwas considerable, and Miss Chancellor had ordered a hackney-coach, it\r\nbeing one of the advantages of living in Charles Street that stables\r\nwere near. The logic of her conduct was none of the clearest; for if she\r\nhad been alone she would have proceeded to her destination by the aid of\r\nthe street-car; not from economy (for she had the good fortune not to be\r\nobliged to consult it to that degree), and not from any love of\r\nwandering about Boston at night (a kind of exposure she greatly\r\ndisliked), but by reason of a theory she devotedly nursed, a theory\r\nwhich bade her put off invidious differences and mingle in the common\r\nlife. She would have gone on foot to Boylston Street, and there she\r\nwould have taken the public conveyance (in her heart she loathed it) to\r\nthe South End. Boston was full of poor girls who had to walk about at\r\nnight and to squeeze into horse-cars in which every sense was\r\ndispleased; and why should she hold herself superior to these? Olive\r\nChancellor regulated her conduct on lofty principles, and this is why,\r\nhaving to-night the advantage of a gentleman\'s protection, she sent for\r\na carriage to obliterate that patronage. If they had gone together in\r\nthe common way she would have seemed to owe it to him that she should be\r\nso daring, and he belonged to a sex to which she wished to be under no\r\nobligations. Months before, when she wrote to him, it had been with the\r\nsense, rather, of putting _him_ in debt. As they rolled toward the South\r\nEnd, side by side, in a good deal of silence, bouncing and bumping over\r\nthe railway-tracks very little less, after all, than if their wheels had\r\nbeen fitted to them, and looking out on either side at rows of red\r\nhouses, dusky in the lamp-light, with protuberant fronts, approached by\r\nladders of stone; as they proceeded, with these contemplative\r\nundulations, Miss Chancellor said to her companion, with a concentrated\r\ndesire to defy him, as a punishment for having thrown her (she couldn\'t\r\ntell why) into such a tremor:\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you believe, then, in the coming of a better day--in its being\r\npossible to do something for the human race?"\r\n\r\nPoor Ransom perceived the defiance, and he felt rather bewildered; he\r\nwondered what type, after all, he _had_ got hold of, and what game was\r\nbeing played with him. Why had she made advances, if she wanted to pinch\r\nhim this way? However, he was good for any game--that one as well as\r\nanother--and he saw that he was "in" for something of which he had long\r\ndesired to have a nearer view. "Well, Miss Olive," he answered, putting\r\non again his big hat, which he had been holding in his lap, "what\r\nstrikes me most is that the human race has got to bear its troubles."\r\n\r\n"That\'s what men say to women, to make them patient in the position they\r\nhave made for them."\r\n\r\n"Oh, the position of women!" Basil Ransom exclaimed. "The position of\r\nwomen is to make fools of men. I would change my position for yours any\r\nday," he went on. "That\'s what I said to myself as I sat there in your\r\nelegant home."\r\n\r\nHe could not see, in the dimness of the carriage, that she had flushed\r\nquickly, and he did not know that she disliked to be reminded of certain\r\nthings which, for her, were mitigations of the hard feminine lot. But\r\nthe passionate quaver with which, a moment later, she answered him\r\nsufficiently assured him that he had touched her at a tender point.\r\n\r\n"Do you make it a reproach to me that I happen to have a little money?\r\nThe dearest wish of my heart is to do something with it for others--for\r\nthe miserable."\r\n\r\nBasil Ransom might have greeted this last declaration with the sympathy\r\nit deserved, might have commended the noble aspirations of his\r\nkinswoman. But what struck him, rather, was the oddity of so sudden a\r\nsharpness of pitch in an intercourse which, an hour or two before, had\r\nbegun in perfect amity, and he burst once more into an irrepressible\r\nlaugh. This made his companion feel, with intensity, how little she was\r\njoking. "I don\'t know why I should care what you think," she said.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t care--don\'t care. What does it matter? It is not of the slightest\r\nimportance."\r\n\r\nHe might say that, but it was not true; she felt that there were reasons\r\nwhy she should care. She had brought him into her life, and she should\r\nhave to pay for it. But she wished to know the worst at once. "Are you\r\nagainst our emancipation?" she asked, turning a white face on him in the\r\nmomentary radiance of a street-lamp.\r\n\r\n"Do you mean your voting and preaching and all that sort of thing?" He\r\nmade this inquiry, but seeing how seriously she would take his answer,\r\nhe was almost frightened, and hung fire. "I will tell you when I have\r\nheard Mrs. Farrinder."\r\n\r\nThey had arrived at the address given by Miss Chancellor to the\r\ncoachman, and their vehicle stopped with a lurch. Basil Ransom got out;\r\nhe stood at the door with an extended hand, to assist the young lady.\r\nBut she seemed to hesitate; she sat there with her spectral face. "You\r\nhate it!" she exclaimed, in a low tone.\r\n\r\n"Miss Birdseye will convert me," said Ransom, with intention; for he had\r\ngrown very curious, and he was afraid that now, at the last, Miss\r\nChancellor would prevent his entering the house. She alighted without\r\nhis help, and behind her he ascended the high steps of Miss Birdseye\'s\r\nresidence. He had grown very curious, and among the things he wanted to\r\nknow was why in the world this ticklish spinster had written to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nShe had told him before they started that they should be early; she\r\nwished to see Miss Birdseye alone, before the arrival of any one else.\r\nThis was just for the pleasure of seeing her--it was an opportunity; she\r\nwas always so taken up with others. She received Miss Chancellor in the\r\nhall of the mansion, which had a salient front, an enormous and very\r\nhigh number--756--painted in gilt on the glass light above the door, a\r\ntin sign bearing the name of a doctress (Mary J. Prance) suspended from\r\none of the windows of the basement, and a peculiar look of being both\r\nnew and faded--a kind of modern fatigue--like certain articles of\r\ncommerce which are sold at a reduction as shop-worn. The hall was very\r\nnarrow; a considerable part of it was occupied by a large hat-tree, from\r\nwhich several coats and shawls already depended; the rest offered space\r\nfor certain lateral demonstrations on Miss Birdseye\'s part. She sidled\r\nabout her visitors, and at last went round to open for them a door of\r\nfurther admission, which happened to be locked inside. She was a little\r\nold lady, with an enormous head; that was the first thing Ransom\r\nnoticed--the vast, fair, protuberant, candid, ungarnished brow,\r\nsurmounting a pair of weak, kind, tired-looking eyes, and ineffectually\r\nbalanced in the rear by a cap which had the air of falling backward, and\r\nwhich Miss Birdseye suddenly felt for while she talked, with\r\nunsuccessful irrelevant movements. She had a sad, soft, pale face, which\r\n(and it was the effect of her whole head) looked as if it had been\r\nsoaked, blurred, and made vague by exposure to some slow dissolvent. The\r\nlong practice of philanthropy had not given accent to her features; it\r\nhad rubbed out their transitions, their meanings. The waves of sympathy,\r\nof enthusiasm, had wrought upon them in the same way in which the waves\r\nof time finally modify the surface of old marble busts, gradually\r\nwashing away their sharpness, their details. In her large countenance\r\nher dim little smile scarcely showed. It was a mere sketch of a smile, a\r\nkind of instalment, or payment on account; it seemed to say that she\r\nwould smile more if she had time, but that you could see, without this,\r\nthat she was gentle and easy to beguile.\r\n\r\nShe always dressed in the same way: she wore a loose black jacket, with\r\ndeep pockets, which were stuffed with papers, memoranda of a voluminous\r\ncorrespondence; and from beneath her jacket depended a short stuff\r\ndress. The brevity of this simple garment was the one device by which\r\nMiss Birdseye managed to suggest that she was a woman of business, that\r\nshe wished to be free for action. She belonged to the Short-Skirts\r\nLeague, as a matter of course; for she belonged to any and every league\r\nthat had been founded for almost any purpose whatever. This did not\r\nprevent her being a confused, entangled, inconsequent, discursive old\r\nwoman, whose charity began at home and ended nowhere, whose credulity\r\nkept pace with it, and who knew less about her fellow-creatures, if\r\npossible, after fifty years of humanitary zeal, than on the day she had\r\ngone into the field to testify against the iniquity of most\r\narrangements. Basil Ransom knew very little about such a life as hers,\r\nbut she seemed to him a revelation of a class, and a multitude of\r\nsocialistic figures, of names and episodes that he had heard of, grouped\r\nthemselves behind her. She looked as if she had spent her life on\r\nplatforms, in audiences, in conventions, in phalansteries, in _s\xe9ances_;\r\nin her faded face there was a kind of reflexion of ugly lecture-lamps;\r\nwith its habit of an upward angle, it seemed turned toward a public\r\nspeaker, with an effort of respiration in the thick air in which social\r\nreforms are usually discussed. She talked continually, in a voice of\r\nwhich the spring seemed broken, like that of an over-worked bell-wire;\r\nand when Miss Chancellor explained that she had brought Mr. Ransom\r\nbecause he was so anxious to meet Mrs. Farrinder, she gave the young man\r\na delicate, dirty, democratic little hand, looking at him kindly, as she\r\ncould not help doing, but without the smallest discrimination as against\r\nothers who might not have the good fortune (which involved, possibly, an\r\ninjustice) to be present on such an interesting occasion. She struck him\r\nas very poor, but it was only afterward that he learned she had never\r\nhad a penny in her life. No one had an idea how she lived; whenever\r\nmoney was given her she gave it away to a negro or a refugee. No woman\r\ncould be less invidious, but on the whole she preferred these two\r\nclasses of the human race. Since the Civil War much of her occupation\r\nwas gone; for before that her best hours had been spent in fancying that\r\nshe was helping some Southern slave to escape. It would have been a nice\r\nquestion whether, in her heart of hearts, for the sake of this\r\nexcitement, she did not sometimes wish the blacks back in bondage. She\r\nhad suffered in the same way by the relaxation of many European\r\ndespotisms, for in former years much of the romance of her life had been\r\nin smoothing the pillow of exile for banished conspirators. Her refugees\r\nhad been very precious to her; she was always trying to raise money for\r\nsome cadaverous Pole, to obtain lessons for some shirtless Italian.\r\nThere was a legend that an Hungarian had once possessed himself of her\r\naffections, and had disappeared after robbing her of everything she\r\npossessed. This, however, was very apocryphal, for she had never\r\npossessed anything, and it was open to grave doubt that she could have\r\nentertained a sentiment so personal. She was in love, even in those\r\ndays, only with causes, and she languished only for emancipations. But\r\nthey had been the happiest days, for when causes were embodied in\r\nforeigners (what else were the Africans?), they were certainly more\r\nappealing.\r\n\r\nShe had just come down to see Doctor Prance--to see whether she wouldn\'t\r\nlike to come up. But she wasn\'t in her room, and Miss Birdseye guessed\r\nshe had gone out to her supper; she got her supper at a boarding-table\r\nabout two blocks off. Miss Birdseye expressed the hope that Miss\r\nChancellor had had hers; she would have had plenty of time to take it,\r\nfor no one had come in yet; she didn\'t know what made them all so late.\r\nRansom perceived that the garments suspended to the hat-rack were not a\r\nsign that Miss Birdseye\'s friends had assembled; if he had gone a little\r\nfurther still he would have recognised the house as one of those in\r\nwhich mysterious articles of clothing are always hooked to something in\r\nthe hall. Miss Birdseye\'s visitors, those of Doctor Prance, and of other\r\ntenants--for Number 756 was the common residence of several persons,\r\namong whom there prevailed much vagueness of boundary--used to leave\r\nthings to be called for; many of them went about with satchels and\r\nreticules, for which they were always looking for places of deposit.\r\nWhat completed the character of this interior was Miss Birdseye\'s own\r\napartment, into which her guests presently made their way, and where\r\nthey were joined by various other members of the good lady\'s circle.\r\nIndeed, it completed Miss Birdseye herself, if anything could be said to\r\nrender that office to this essentially formless old woman, who had no\r\nmore outline than a bundle of hay. But the bareness of her long, loose,\r\nempty parlour (it was shaped exactly like Miss Chancellor\'s) told that\r\nshe had never had any needs but moral needs, and that all her history\r\nhad been that of her sympathies. The place was lighted by a small hot\r\nglare of gas, which made it look white and featureless. It struck even\r\nBasil Ransom with its flatness, and he said to himself that his cousin\r\nmust have a very big bee in her bonnet to make her like such a house. He\r\ndid not know then, and he never knew, that she mortally disliked it, and\r\nthat in a career in which she was constantly exposing herself to offence\r\nand laceration, her most poignant suffering came from the injury of her\r\ntaste. She had tried to kill that nerve, to persuade herself that taste\r\nwas only frivolity in the disguise of knowledge; but her susceptibility\r\nwas constantly blooming afresh and making her wonder whether an absence\r\nof nice arrangements were a necessary part of the enthusiasm of\r\nhumanity. Miss Birdseye was always trying to obtain employment, lessons\r\nin drawing, orders for portraits, for poor foreign artists, as to the\r\ngreatness of whose talent she pledged herself without reserve; but in\r\npoint of fact she had not the faintest sense of the scenic or plastic\r\nside of life.\r\n\r\nToward nine o\'clock the light of her hissing burners smote the majestic\r\nperson of Mrs. Farrinder, who might have contributed to answer that\r\nquestion of Miss Chancellor\'s in the negative. She was a copious,\r\nhandsome woman, in whom angularity had been corrected by the air of\r\nsuccess; she had a rustling dress (it was evident what _she_ thought\r\nabout taste), abundant hair of a glossy blackness, a pair of folded\r\narms, the expression of which seemed to say that rest, in such a career\r\nas hers, was as sweet as it was brief, and a terrible regularity of\r\nfeature. I apply that adjective to her fine placid mask because she\r\nseemed to face you with a question of which the answer was preordained,\r\nto ask you how a countenance could fail to be noble of which the\r\nmeasurements were so correct. You could contest neither the measurements\r\nnor the nobleness, and had to feel that Mrs. Farrinder imposed herself.\r\nThere was a lithographic smoothness about her, and a mixture of the\r\nAmerican matron and the public character. There was something public in\r\nher eye, which was large, cold, and quiet; it had acquired a sort of\r\nexposed reticence from the habit of looking down from a lecture-desk,\r\nover a sea of heads, while its distinguished owner was eulogised by a\r\nleading citizen. Mrs. Farrinder, at almost any time, had the air of\r\nbeing introduced by a few remarks. She talked with great slowness and\r\ndistinctness, and evidently a high sense of responsibility; she\r\npronounced every syllable of every word and insisted on being explicit.\r\nIf, in conversation with her, you attempted to take anything for\r\ngranted, or to jump two or three steps at a time, she paused, looking at\r\nyou with a cold patience, as if she knew that trick, and then went on at\r\nher own measured pace. She lectured on temperance and the rights of\r\nwomen; the ends she laboured for were to give the ballot to every woman\r\nin the country and to take the flowing bowl from every man. She was held\r\nto have a very fine manner, and to embody the domestic virtues and the\r\ngraces of the drawing-room; to be a shining proof, in short, that the\r\nforum, for ladies, is not necessarily hostile to the fireside. She had a\r\nhusband, and his name was Amariah.\r\n\r\nDoctor Prance had come back from supper and made her appearance in\r\nresponse to an invitation that Miss Birdseye\'s relaxed voice had tinkled\r\ndown to her from the hall over the banisters, with much repetition, to\r\nsecure attention. She was a plain, spare young woman, with short hair\r\nand an eye-glass; she looked about her with a kind of near-sighted\r\ndeprecation, and seemed to hope that she should not be expected to\r\ngeneralise in any way, or supposed to have come up for any purpose more\r\nsocial than to see what Miss Birdseye wanted this time. By nine o\'clock\r\ntwenty other persons had arrived, and had placed themselves in the\r\nchairs that were ranged along the sides of the long, bald room, in which\r\nthey ended by producing the similitude of an enormous street-car. The\r\napartment contained little else but these chairs, many of which had a\r\nborrowed aspect, an implication of bare bedrooms in the upper regions; a\r\ntable or two with a discoloured marble top, a few books, and a\r\ncollection of newspapers piled up in corners. Ransom could see for\r\nhimself that the occasion was not crudely festive; there was a want of\r\nconvivial movement, and, among most of the visitors, even of mutual\r\nrecognition. They sat there as if they were waiting for something; they\r\nlooked obliquely and silently at Mrs. Farrinder, and were plainly under\r\nthe impression that, fortunately, they were not there to amuse\r\nthemselves. The ladies, who were much the more numerous, wore their\r\nbonnets, like Miss Chancellor; the men were in the garb of toil, many of\r\nthem in weary-looking overcoats. Two or three had retained their\r\novershoes, and as you approached them the odour of the india-rubber was\r\nperceptible. It was not, however, that Miss Birdseye ever noticed\r\nanything of that sort; she neither knew what she smelled nor tasted what\r\nshe ate. Most of her friends had an anxious, haggard look, though there\r\nwere sundry exceptions--half-a-dozen placid, florid faces. Basil Ransom\r\nwondered who they all were; he had a general idea they were mediums,\r\ncommunists, vegetarians. It was not, either, that Miss Birdseye failed\r\nto wander about among them with repetitions of inquiry and friendly\r\nabsences of attention; she sat down near most of them in turn, saying\r\n"Yes, yes," vaguely and kindly, to remarks they made to her, feeling for\r\nthe papers in the pockets of her loosened bodice, recovering her cap and\r\nsacrificing her spectacles, wondering most of all what had been her idea\r\nin convoking these people. Then she remembered that it had been\r\nconnected in some way with Mrs. Farrinder; that this eloquent woman had\r\npromised to favour the company with a few reminiscences of her last\r\ncampaign; to sketch even, perhaps, the lines on which she intended to\r\noperate during the coming winter. This was what Olive Chancellor had\r\ncome to hear; this would be the attraction for the dark-eyed young man\r\n(he looked like a genius) she had brought with her. Miss Birdseye made\r\nher way back to the great lecturess, who was bending an indulgent\r\nattention on Miss Chancellor; the latter compressed into a small space,\r\nto be near her, and sitting with clasped hands and a concentration of\r\ninquiry which by contrast made Mrs. Farrinder\'s manner seem large and\r\nfree. In her transit, however, the hostess was checked by the arrival of\r\nfresh pilgrims; she had no idea she had mentioned the occasion to so\r\nmany people--she only remembered, as it were, those she had\r\nforgotten--and it was certainly a proof of the interest felt in Mrs.\r\nFarrinder\'s work. The people who had just come in were Doctor and Mrs.\r\nTarrant and their daughter Verena; he was a mesmeric healer and she was\r\nof old Abolitionist stock. Miss Birdseye rested her dim, dry smile upon\r\nthe daughter, who was new to her, and it floated before her that she\r\nwould probably be remarkable as a genius; her parentage was an\r\nimplication of that. There was a genius for Miss Birdseye in every bush.\r\nSelah Tarrant had effected wonderful cures; she knew so many people--if\r\nthey would only try him. His wife was a daughter of Abraham Greenstreet;\r\nshe had kept a runaway slave in her house for thirty days. That was\r\nyears before, when this girl must have been a child; but hadn\'t it\r\nthrown a kind of rainbow over her cradle, and wouldn\'t she naturally\r\nhave some gift? The girl was very pretty, though she had red hair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Farrinder, meanwhile, was not eager to address the assembly. She\r\nconfessed as much to Olive Chancellor, with a smile which asked that a\r\ntemporary lapse of promptness might not be too harshly judged. She had\r\naddressed so many assemblies, and she wanted to hear what other people\r\nhad to say. Miss Chancellor herself had thought so much on the vital\r\nsubject; would not she make a few remarks and give them some of her\r\nexperiences? How did the ladies on Beacon Street feel about the ballot?\r\nPerhaps she could speak for _them_ more than for some others. That was a\r\nbranch of the question on which, it might be, the leaders had not\r\ninformation enough; but they wanted to take in everything, and why\r\nshouldn\'t Miss Chancellor just make that field her own? Mrs. Farrinder\r\nspoke in the tone of one who took views so wide that they might easily,\r\nat first, before you could see how she worked round, look almost\r\nmeretricious; she was conscious of a scope that exceeded the first\r\nflight of your imagination. She urged upon her companion the idea of\r\nlabouring in the world of fashion, appeared to attribute to her familiar\r\nrelations with that mysterious realm, and wanted to know why she\r\nshouldn\'t stir up some of her friends down there on the Mill-dam?\r\n\r\nOlive Chancellor received this appeal with peculiar feelings. With her\r\nimmense sympathy for reform, she found herself so often wishing that\r\nreformers were a little different. There was something grand about Mrs.\r\nFarrinder; it lifted one up to be with her: but there was a false note\r\nwhen she spoke to her young friend about the ladies in Beacon Street.\r\nOlive hated to hear that fine avenue talked about as if it were such a\r\nremarkable place, and to live there were a proof of worldly glory. All\r\nsorts of inferior people lived there, and so brilliant a woman as Mrs.\r\nFarrinder, who lived at Roxbury, ought not to mix things up. It was, of\r\ncourse, very wretched to be irritated by such mistakes; but this was not\r\nthe first time Miss Chancellor had observed that the possession of\r\nnerves was not by itself a reason for embracing the new truths. She knew\r\nher place in the Boston hierarchy, and it was not what Mrs. Farrinder\r\nsupposed; so that there was a want of perspective in talking to her as\r\nif she had been a representative of the aristocracy. Nothing could be\r\nweaker, she knew very well, than (in the United States) to apply that\r\nterm too literally; nevertheless, it would represent a reality if one\r\nwere to say that, by distinction, the Chancellors belonged to the\r\n_bourgeoisie_--the oldest and best. They might care for such a position\r\nor not (as it happened, they were very proud of it), but there they\r\nwere, and it made Mrs. Farrinder seem provincial (there was something\r\nprovincial, after all, in the way she did her hair too) not to\r\nunderstand. When Miss Birdseye spoke as if one were a "leader of\r\nsociety," Olive could forgive her even that odious expression, because,\r\nof course, one never pretended that she, poor dear, had the smallest\r\nsense of the real. She was heroic, she was sublime, the whole moral\r\nhistory of Boston was reflected in her displaced spectacles; but it was\r\na part of her originality, as it were, that she was deliciously\r\nprovincial. Olive Chancellor seemed to herself to have privileges enough\r\nwithout being affiliated to the exclusive set and having invitations to\r\nthe smaller parties, which were the real test; it was a mercy for her\r\nthat she had not that added immorality on her conscience. The ladies\r\nMrs. Farrinder meant (it was to be supposed she meant some particular\r\nones) might speak for themselves. She wished to work in another field;\r\nshe had long been preoccupied with the romance of the people. She had an\r\nimmense desire to know intimately some _very_ poor girl. This might seem\r\none of the most accessible of pleasures; but, in point of fact, she had\r\nnot found it so. There were two or three pale shop-maidens whose\r\nacquaintance she had sought; but they had seemed afraid of her, and the\r\nattempt had come to nothing. She took them more tragically then they\r\ntook themselves; they couldn\'t make out what she wanted them to do, and\r\nthey always ended by being odiously mixed up with Charlie. Charlie was a\r\nyoung man in a white overcoat and a paper collar; it was for him, in the\r\nlast analysis, that they cared much the most. They cared far more about\r\nCharlie than about the ballot. Olive Chancellor wondered how Mrs.\r\nFarrinder would treat that branch of the question. In her researches\r\namong her young townswomen she had always found this obtrusive swain\r\nplanted in her path, and she grew at last to dislike him extremely. It\r\nfilled her with exasperation to think that he should be necessary to the\r\nhappiness of his victims (she had learned that whatever they might talk\r\nabout with her, it was of him and him only that they discoursed among\r\nthemselves), and one of the main recommendations of the evening club for\r\nher fatigued, underpaid sisters, which it had long been her dream to\r\nestablish, was that it would in some degree undermine his\r\nposition--distinct as her prevision might be that he would be in waiting\r\nat the door. She hardly knew what to say to Mrs. Farrinder when this\r\nmomentarily misdirected woman, still preoccupied with the Mill-dam,\r\nreturned to the charge.\r\n\r\n"We want labourers in that field, though I know two or three lovely\r\nwomen--sweet _home-women_--moving in circles that are for the most part\r\nclosed to every new voice, who are doing their best to help on the\r\nfight. I have several names that might surprise you, names well known on\r\nState Street. But we can\'t have too many recruits, especially among\r\nthose whose refinement is generally acknowledged. If it be necessary, we\r\nare prepared to take certain steps to conciliate the shrinking. Our\r\nmovement is for all--it appeals to the most delicate ladies. Raise the\r\nstandard among them, and bring me a thousand names. I know several that\r\nI should like to have. I look after the details as well as the big\r\ncurrents," Mrs. Farrinder added, in a tone as explanatory as could be\r\nexpected of such a woman, and with a smile of which the sweetness was\r\nthrilling to her listener.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t talk to those people, I can\'t!" said Olive Chancellor, with a\r\nface which seemed to plead for a remission of responsibility. "I want to\r\ngive myself up to others; I want to know everything that lies beneath\r\nand out of sight, don\'t you know? I want to enter into the lives of\r\nwomen who are lonely, who are piteous. I want to be near to them--to\r\nhelp them. I want to do something--oh, I should like so to speak!"\r\n\r\n"We should be glad to have you make a few remarks at present," Mrs.\r\nFarrinder declared, with a punctuality which revealed the faculty of\r\npresiding.\r\n\r\n"Oh dear, no, I can\'t speak; I have none of that sort of talent. I have\r\nno self-possession, no eloquence; I can\'t put three words together. But\r\nI do want to contribute."\r\n\r\n"What _have_ you got?" Mrs. Farrinder inquired, looking at her\r\ninterlocutress, up and down, with the eye of business, in which there\r\nwas a certain chill. "Have you got money?"\r\n\r\nOlive was so agitated for the moment with the hope that this great woman\r\nwould approve of her on the financial side that she took no time to\r\nreflect that some other quality might, in courtesy, have been suggested.\r\nBut she confessed to possessing a certain capital, and the tone seemed\r\nrich and deep in which Mrs. Farrinder said to her, "Then contribute\r\nthat!" She was so good as to develop this idea, and her picture of the\r\npart Miss Chancellor might play by making liberal donations to a fund\r\nfor the diffusion among the women of America of a more adequate\r\nconception of their public and private rights--a fund her adviser had\r\nherself lately inaugurated--this bold, rapid sketch had the vividness\r\nwhich characterised the speaker\'s most successful public efforts. It\r\nplaced Olive under the spell; it made her feel almost inspired. If her\r\nlife struck others in that way--especially a woman like Mrs. Farrinder,\r\nwhose horizon was so full--then there must be something for her to do.\r\nIt was one thing to choose for herself, but now the great representative\r\nof the enfranchisement of their sex (from every form of bondage) had\r\nchosen for her.\r\n\r\nThe barren, gas-lighted room grew richer and richer to her earnest eyes;\r\nit seemed to expand, to open itself to the great life of humanity. The\r\nserious, tired people, in their bonnets and overcoats, began to glow\r\nlike a company of heroes. Yes, she would do something, Olive Chancellor\r\nsaid to herself; she would do something to brighten the darkness of that\r\ndreadful image that was always before her, and against which it seemed\r\nto her at times that she had been born to lead a crusade--the image of\r\nthe unhappiness of women. The unhappiness of women! The voice of their\r\nsilent suffering was always in her ears, the ocean of tears that they\r\nhad shed from the beginning of time seemed to pour through her own eyes.\r\nAges of oppression had rolled over them; uncounted millions had lived\r\nonly to be tortured, to be crucified. They were her sisters, they were\r\nher own, and the day of their delivery had dawned. This was the only\r\nsacred cause; this was the great, the just revolution. It must triumph,\r\nit must sweep everything before it; it must exact from the other, the\r\nbrutal, blood-stained, ravening race, the last particle of expiation! It\r\nwould be the greatest change the world had seen; it would be a new era\r\nfor the human family, and the names of those who had helped to show the\r\nway and lead the squadrons would be the brightest in the tables of fame.\r\nThey would be names of women weak, insulted, persecuted, but devoted in\r\nevery pulse of their being to the cause, and asking no better fate than\r\nto die for it. It was not clear to this interesting girl in what manner\r\nsuch a sacrifice (as this last) would be required of her, but she saw\r\nthe matter through a kind of sunrise-mist of emotion which made danger\r\nas rosy as success. When Miss Birdseye approached, it transfigured her\r\nfamiliar, her comical shape, and made the poor little humanitary hack\r\nseem already a martyr. Olive Chancellor looked at her with love,\r\nremembered that she had never, in her long, unrewarded, weary life, had\r\na thought or an impulse for herself. She had been consumed by the\r\npassion of sympathy; it had crumpled her into as many creases as an old\r\nglazed, distended glove. She had been laughed at, but she never knew it;\r\nshe was treated as a bore, but she never cared. She had nothing in the\r\nworld but the clothes on her back, and when she should go down into the\r\ngrave she would leave nothing behind her but her grotesque,\r\nundistinguished, pathetic little name. And yet people said that women\r\nwere vain, that they were personal, that they were interested! While\r\nMiss Birdseye stood there, asking Mrs. Farrinder if she wouldn\'t say\r\nsomething, Olive Chancellor tenderly fastened a small battered brooch\r\nwhich confined her collar and which had half detached itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n\r\n"Oh, thank you," said Miss Birdseye, "I shouldn\'t like to lose it; it\r\nwas given me by Mirandola!" He had been one of her refugees in the old\r\ntime, when two or three of her friends, acquainted with the limits of\r\nhis resources, wondered how he had come into possession of the trinket.\r\nShe had been diverted again, after her greeting with Doctor and Mrs.\r\nTarrant, by stopping to introduce the tall, dark young man whom Miss\r\nChancellor had brought with her to Doctor Prance. She had become\r\nconscious of his somewhat sombre figure, uplifted against the wall, near\r\nthe door; he was leaning there in solitude, unacquainted with\r\nopportunities which Miss Birdseye felt to be, collectively, of value,\r\nand which were really, of course, what strangers came to Boston for. It\r\ndid not occur to her to ask herself why Miss Chancellor didn\'t talk to\r\nhim, since she had brought him; Miss Birdseye was incapable of a\r\nspeculation of this kind. Olive, in fact, had remained vividly conscious\r\nof her kinsman\'s isolation until the moment when Mrs. Farrinder lifted\r\nher, with a word, to a higher plane. She watched him across the room;\r\nshe saw that he might be bored. But she proposed to herself not to mind\r\nthat; she had asked him, after all, not to come. Then he was no worse\r\noff than others; he was only waiting, like the rest; and before they\r\nleft she would introduce him to Mrs. Farrinder. She might tell that lady\r\nwho he was first; it was not every one that would care to know a person\r\nwho had borne such a part in the Southern disloyalty. It came over our\r\nyoung lady that when she sought the acquaintance of her distant kinsman\r\nshe had indeed done a more complicated thing than she suspected. The\r\nsudden uneasiness that he flung over her in the carriage had not left\r\nher, though she felt it less now she was with others, and especially\r\nthat she was close to Mrs. Farrinder, who was such a fountain of\r\nstrength. At any rate, if he was bored, he could speak to some one;\r\nthere were excellent people near him, even if they _were_ ardent\r\nreformers. He could speak to that pretty girl who had just come in--the\r\none with red hair--if he liked; Southerners were supposed to be so\r\nchivalrous!\r\n\r\nMiss Birdseye reasoned much less, and did not offer to introduce him to\r\nVerena Tarrant, who was apparently being presented by her parents to a\r\ngroup of friends at the other end of the room. It came back to Miss\r\nBirdseye, in this connexion, that, sure enough, Verena had been away for\r\na long time--for nearly a year; had been on a visit to friends in the\r\nWest, and would therefore naturally be a stranger to most of the Boston\r\ncircle. Doctor Prance was looking at her--at Miss Birdseye--with little,\r\nsharp, fixed pupils; and the good lady wondered whether she were angry\r\nat having been induced to come up. She had a general impression that\r\nwhen genius was original its temper was high, and all this would be the\r\ncase with Doctor Prance. She wanted to say to her that she could go down\r\nagain if she liked; but even to Miss Birdseye\'s unsophisticated mind\r\nthis scarcely appeared, as regards a guest, an adequate formula of\r\ndismissal. She tried to bring the young Southerner out; she said to him\r\nthat she presumed they would have some entertainment soon--Mrs.\r\nFarrinder could be interesting when she tried! And then she bethought\r\nherself to introduce him to Doctor Prance; it might serve as a reason\r\nfor having brought her up. Moreover, it would do her good to break up\r\nher work now and then; she pursued her medical studies far into the\r\nnight, and Miss Birdseye, who was nothing of a sleeper (Mary Prance,\r\nprecisely, had wanted to treat her for it), had heard her, in the\r\nstillness of the small hours, with her open windows (she had fresh air\r\non the brain), sharpening instruments (it was Miss Birdseye\'s mild\r\nbelief that she dissected), in a little physiological laboratory which\r\nshe had set up in her back room, the room which, if she hadn\'t been a\r\ndoctor, might have been her "chamber," and perhaps was, even with the\r\ndissecting, Miss Birdseye didn\'t know! She explained her young friends\r\nto each other, a trifle incoherently, perhaps, and then went to stir up\r\nMrs. Farrinder.\r\n\r\nBasil Ransom had already noticed Doctor Prance; he had not been at all\r\nbored, and had observed every one in the room, arriving at all sorts of\r\ningenious inductions. The little medical lady struck him as a perfect\r\nexample of the "Yankee female"--the figure which, in the unregenerate\r\nimagination of the children of the cotton-States, was produced by the\r\nNew England school-system, the Puritan code, the ungenial climate, the\r\nabsence of chivalry. Spare, dry, hard, without a curve, an inflexion or\r\na grace, she seemed to ask no odds in the battle of life and to be\r\nprepared to give none. But Ransom could see that she was not an\r\nenthusiast, and after his contact with his cousin\'s enthusiasm this was\r\nrather a relief to him. She looked like a boy, and not even like a good\r\nboy. It was evident that if she had been a boy, she would have "cut"\r\nschool, to try private experiments in mechanics or to make researches in\r\nnatural history. It was true that if she had been a boy she would have\r\nborne some relation to a girl, whereas Doctor Prance appeared to bear\r\nnone whatever. Except her intelligent eye, she had no features to speak\r\nof. Ransom asked her if she were acquainted with the lioness, and on her\r\nstaring at him, without response, explained that he meant the renowned\r\nMrs. Farrinder.\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t know as I ought to say that I\'m acquainted with her; but\r\nI\'ve heard her on the platform. I have paid my half-dollar," the doctor\r\nadded, with a certain grimness.\r\n\r\n"Well, did she convince you?" Ransom inquired.\r\n\r\n"Convince me of what, sir?"\r\n\r\n"That women are so superior to men."\r\n\r\n"Oh, deary me!" said Doctor Prance, with a little impatient sigh; "I\r\nguess I know more about women than she does."\r\n\r\n"And that isn\'t your opinion, I hope," said Ransom, laughing.\r\n\r\n"Men and women are all the same to me," Doctor Prance remarked. "I don\'t\r\nsee any difference. There is room for improvement in both sexes. Neither\r\nof them is up to the standard." And on Ransom\'s asking her what the\r\nstandard appeared to her to be, she said, "Well, they ought to live\r\nbetter; that\'s what they ought to do." And she went on to declare,\r\nfurther, that she thought they all talked too much. This had so long\r\nbeen Ransom\'s conviction that his heart quite warmed to Doctor Prance,\r\nand he paid homage to her wisdom in the manner of Mississippi--with a\r\nrichness of compliment that made her turn her acute, suspicious eye upon\r\nhim. This checked him; she was capable of thinking that _he_ talked too\r\nmuch--she herself having, apparently, no general conversation. It was\r\ngerman to the matter, at any rate, for him to observe that he believed\r\nthey were to have a lecture from Mrs. Farrinder--he didn\'t know why she\r\ndidn\'t begin. "Yes," said Doctor Prance, rather dryly, "I suppose that\'s\r\nwhat Miss Birdseye called me up for. She seemed to think I wouldn\'t want\r\nto miss that."\r\n\r\n"Whereas, I infer, you could console yourself for the loss of the\r\noration," Ransom suggested.\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'ve got some work. I don\'t want any one to teach me what a woman\r\ncan do!" Doctor Prance declared. "She can find out some things, if she\r\ntries. Besides, I am familiar with Mrs. Farrinder\'s system; I know all\r\nshe has got to say."\r\n\r\n"Well, what is it, then, since she continues to remain silent?"\r\n\r\n"Well, what it amounts to is just that women want to have a better time.\r\nThat\'s what it comes to in the end. I am aware of that, without her\r\ntelling me."\r\n\r\n"And don\'t you sympathise with such an aspiration?"\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t know as I cultivate the sentimental side," said Doctor\r\nPrance. "There\'s plenty of sympathy without mine. If they want to have a\r\nbetter time, I suppose it\'s natural; so do men too, I suppose. But I\r\ndon\'t know as it appeals to me--to make sacrifices for it; it ain\'t such\r\na wonderful time--the best you _can_ have!"\r\n\r\nThis little lady was tough and technical; she evidently didn\'t care for\r\ngreat movements; she became more and more interesting to Basil Ransom,\r\nwho, it is to be feared, had a fund of cynicism. He asked her if she\r\nknew his cousin, Miss Chancellor, whom he indicated, beside Mrs.\r\nFarrinder; _she_ believed, on the contrary, in wonderful times (she\r\nthought they were coming); she had plenty of sympathy, and he was sure\r\nshe was willing to make sacrifices.\r\n\r\nDoctor Prance looked at her across the room for a moment; then she said\r\nshe didn\'t know her, but she guessed she knew others like her--she went\r\nto see them when they were sick. "She\'s having a private lecture to\r\nherself," Ransom remarked; whereupon Doctor Prance rejoined, "Well, I\r\nguess she\'ll have to pay for it!" She appeared to regret her own\r\nhalf-dollar, and to be vaguely impatient of the behaviour of her sex.\r\nRansom became so sensible of this that he felt it was indelicate to\r\nallude further to the cause of woman, and, for a change, endeavoured to\r\nelicit from his companion some information about the gentlemen present.\r\nHe had given her a chance, vainly, to start some topic herself; but he\r\ncould see that she had no interests beyond the researches from which,\r\nthis evening, she had been torn, and was incapable of asking him a\r\npersonal question. She knew two or three of the gentlemen; she had seen\r\nthem before at Miss Birdseye\'s. Of course she knew principally ladies;\r\nthe time hadn\'t come when a lady-doctor was sent for by a gentleman, and\r\nshe hoped it never would, though some people seemed to think that this\r\nwas what lady-doctors were working for. She knew Mr. Pardon; that was\r\nthe young man with the "side-whiskers" and the white hair; he was a kind\r\nof editor, and he wrote, too, "over his signature"--perhaps Basil had\r\nread some of his works; he was under thirty, in spite of his white hair.\r\nHe was a great deal thought of in magazine circles. She believed he was\r\nvery bright--but she hadn\'t read anything. She didn\'t read much--not for\r\namusement; only the _Transcript_. She believed Mr. Pardon sometimes\r\nwrote in the _Transcript_; well, she supposed he _was_ very bright. The\r\nother that she knew--only she didn\'t know him (she supposed Basil would\r\nthink that queer)--was the tall, pale gentleman, with the black\r\nmoustache and the eye-glass. She knew him because she had met him in\r\nsociety; but she didn\'t know him--well, because she didn\'t want to. If\r\nhe should come and speak to her--and he looked as if he were going to\r\nwork round that way--she should just say to him, "Yes, sir," or "No,\r\nsir," very coldly. She couldn\'t help it if he did think her dry; if _he_\r\nwere a little more dry, it might be better for him. What was the matter\r\nwith him? Oh, she thought she had mentioned that; he was a mesmeric\r\nhealer, he made miraculous cures. She didn\'t believe in his system or\r\ndisbelieve in it, one way or the other; she only knew that she had been\r\ncalled to see ladies he had worked on, and she found that he had made\r\nthem lose a lot of valuable time. He talked to them--well, as if he\r\ndidn\'t know what he was saying. She guessed he was quite ignorant of\r\nphysiology, and she didn\'t think he ought to go round taking\r\nresponsibilities. She didn\'t want to be narrow, but she thought a person\r\nought to know something. She supposed Basil would think her very\r\nuplifted; but he had put the question to her, as she might say. All she\r\ncould say was she didn\'t want him to be laying his hands on any of _her_\r\nfolks; it was all done with the hands--what wasn\'t done with the tongue!\r\nBasil could see that Doctor Prance was irritated; that this extreme\r\ncandour of allusion to her neighbour was probably not habitual to her,\r\nas a member of a society in which the casual expression of strong\r\nopinion generally produced waves of silence. But he blessed her\r\nirritation, for him it was so illuminating; and to draw further profit\r\nfrom it he asked her who the young lady was with the red hair--the\r\npretty one, whom he had only noticed during the last ten minutes. She\r\nwas Miss Tarrant, the daughter of the healer; hadn\'t she mentioned his\r\nname? Selah Tarrant; if he wanted to send for him. Doctor Prance wasn\'t\r\nacquainted with her, beyond knowing that she was the mesmerist\'s only\r\nchild, and having heard something about her having some gift--she\r\ncouldn\'t remember which it was. Oh, if she was his child, she would be\r\nsure to have some gift--if it was only the gift of the g----well, she\r\ndidn\'t mean to say that; but a talent for conversation. Perhaps she\r\ncould die and come to life again; perhaps she would show them her gift,\r\nas no one seemed inclined to do anything. Yes, she was pretty-appearing,\r\nbut there was a certain indication of an\xe6mia, and Doctor Prance would be\r\nsurprised if she didn\'t eat too much candy. Basil thought she had an\r\nengaging exterior; it was his private reflexion, coloured doubtless by\r\n"sectional" prejudice, that she was the first pretty girl he had seen in\r\nBoston. She was talking with some ladies at the other end of the room;\r\nand she had a large red fan, which she kept constantly in movement. She\r\nwas not a quiet girl; she fidgeted, was restless, while she talked, and\r\nhad the air of a person who, whatever she might be doing, would wish to\r\nbe doing something else. If people watched her a good deal, she also\r\nreturned their contemplation, and her charming eyes had several times\r\nencountered those of Basil Ransom. But they wandered mainly in the\r\ndirection of Mrs. Farrinder--they lingered upon the serene solidity of\r\nthe great oratress. It was easy to see that the girl admired this\r\nbeneficent woman, and felt it a privilege to be near her. It was\r\napparent, indeed, that she was excited by the company in which she found\r\nherself; a fact to be explained by a reference to that recent period of\r\nexile in the West, of which we have had a hint, and in consequence of\r\nwhich the present occasion may have seemed to her a return to\r\nintellectual life. Ransom secretly wished that his cousin--since fate\r\nwas to reserve for him a cousin in Boston--had been more like that.\r\n\r\nBy this time a certain agitation was perceptible; several ladies,\r\nimpatient of vain delay, had left their places, to appeal personally to\r\nMrs. Farrinder, who was presently surrounded with sympathetic\r\nremonstrants. Miss Birdseye had given her up; it had been enough for\r\nMiss Birdseye that she should have said, when pressed (so far as her\r\nhostess, muffled in laxity, could press) on the subject of the general\r\nexpectation, that she could only deliver her message to an audience\r\nwhich she felt to be partially hostile. There was no hostility there;\r\nthey were all only too much in sympathy. "I don\'t require sympathy," she\r\nsaid, with a tranquil smile, to Olive Chancellor; "I am only myself, I\r\nonly rise to the occasion, when I see prejudice, when I see bigotry,\r\nwhen I see injustice, when I see conservatism, massed before me like an\r\narmy. Then I feel--I feel as I imagine Napoleon Bonaparte to have felt\r\non the eve of one of his great victories. I _must_ have unfriendly\r\nelements--I like to win them over."\r\n\r\nOlive thought of Basil Ransom, and wondered whether he would do for an\r\nunfriendly element. She mentioned him to Mrs. Farrinder, who expressed\r\nan earnest hope that if he were opposed to the principles which were so\r\ndear to the rest of them, he might be induced to take the floor and\r\ntestify on his own account. "I should be so happy to answer him," said\r\nMrs. Farrinder, with supreme softness. "I should be so glad, at any\r\nrate, to exchange ideas with him." Olive felt a deep alarm at the idea\r\nof a public dispute between these two vigorous people (she had a\r\nperception that Ransom would be vigorous), not because she doubted of\r\nthe happy issue, but because she herself would be in a false position,\r\nas having brought the offensive young man, and she had a horror of false\r\npositions. Miss Birdseye was incapable of resentment; she had invited\r\nforty people to hear Mrs. Farrinder speak, and now Mrs. Farrinder\r\nwouldn\'t speak. But she had such a beautiful reason for it! There was\r\nsomething martial and heroic in her pretext, and, besides, it was so\r\ncharacteristic, so free, that Miss Birdseye was quite consoled, and\r\nwandered away, looking at her other guests vaguely, as if she didn\'t\r\nknow them from each other, while she mentioned to them, at a venture,\r\nthe excuse for their disappointment, confident, evidently, that they\r\nwould agree with her it was very fine. "But we can\'t pretend to be on\r\nthe other side, just to start her up, can we?" she asked of Mr. Tarrant,\r\nwho sat there beside his wife with a rather conscious but by no means\r\ncomplacent air of isolation from the rest of the company.\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t know--I guess we are all solid here," this gentleman\r\nreplied, looking round him with a slow, deliberate smile, which made his\r\nmouth enormous, developed two wrinkles, as long as the wings of a bat,\r\non either side of it, and showed a set of big, even, carnivorous teeth.\r\n\r\n"Selah," said his wife, laying her hand on the sleeve of his waterproof,\r\n"I wonder whether Miss Birdseye would be interested to hear Verena."\r\n\r\n"Well, if you mean she sings, it\'s a shame I haven\'t got a piano," Miss\r\nBirdseye took upon herself to respond. It came back to her that the girl\r\nhad a gift.\r\n\r\n"She doesn\'t want a piano--she doesn\'t want anything," Selah remarked,\r\ngiving no apparent attention to his wife. It was a part of his attitude\r\nin life never to appear to be indebted to another person for a\r\nsuggestion, never to be surprised or unprepared.\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t know that the interest in singing is so general," said\r\nMiss Birdseye, quite unconscious of any slackness in preparing a\r\nsubstitute for the entertainment that had failed her.\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t singing, you\'ll see," Mrs. Tarrant declared.\r\n\r\n"What is it, then?"\r\n\r\nMr. Tarrant unfurled his wrinkles, showed his back teeth. "It\'s\r\ninspirational."\r\n\r\nMiss Birdseye gave a small, vague, unsceptical laugh. "Well, if you can\r\nguarantee that----"\r\n\r\n"I think it would be acceptable," said Mrs. Tarrant; and putting up a\r\nhalf-gloved, familiar hand, she drew Miss Birdseye down to her, and the\r\npair explained in alternation what it was their child could do.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Basil Ransom confessed to Doctor Prance that he was, after\r\nall, rather disappointed. He had expected more of a programme; he wanted\r\nto hear some of the new truths. Mrs. Farrinder, as he said, remained\r\nwithin her tent, and he had hoped not only to see these distinguished\r\npeople but also to listen to them.\r\n\r\n"Well, _I_ ain\'t disappointed," the sturdy little doctress replied. "If\r\nany question had been opened, I suppose I should have had to stay."\r\n\r\n"But I presume you don\'t propose to retire."\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'ve got to pursue my studies some time. I don\'t want the\r\ngentlemen-doctors to get ahead of me."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no one will ever get ahead of you, I\'m very sure. And there is that\r\npretty young lady going over to speak to Mrs. Farrinder. She\'s going to\r\nbeg her for a speech--Mrs. Farrinder can\'t resist that."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, I\'ll just trickle out before she begins. Good-night, sir,"\r\nsaid Doctor Prance, who by this time had begun to appear to Ransom more\r\nsusceptible of domestication, as if she had been a small\r\nforest-creature, a catamount or a ruffled doe, that had learned to stand\r\nstill while you stroked it, or even to extend a paw. She ministered to\r\nhealth, and she was healthy herself; if his cousin could have been even\r\nof this type Basil would have felt himself more fortunate.\r\n\r\n"Good-night, Doctor," he replied. "You haven\'t told me, after all, your\r\nopinion of the capacity of the ladies."\r\n\r\n"Capacity for what?" said Doctor Prance. "They\'ve got a capacity for\r\nmaking people waste time. All I know is that I don\'t want any one to\r\ntell _me_ what a lady can do!" And she edged away from him softly, as if\r\nshe had been traversing a hospital-ward, and presently he saw her reach\r\nthe door, which, with the arrival of the later comers, had remained\r\nopen. She stood there an instant, turning over the whole assembly a\r\nglance like the flash of a watchman\'s bull\'s-eye, and then quickly\r\npassed out. Ransom could see that she was impatient of the general\r\nquestion and bored with being reminded, even for the sake of her rights,\r\nthat she was a woman--a detail that she was in the habit of forgetting,\r\nhaving as many rights as she had time for. It was certain that whatever\r\nmight become of the movement at large, Doctor Prance\'s own little\r\nrevolution was a success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\n\r\nShe had no sooner left him than Olive Chancellor came towards him with\r\neyes that seemed to say, "I don\'t care whether you are here now or\r\nnot--I\'m all right!" But what her lips said was much more gracious; she\r\nasked him if she mightn\'t have the pleasure of introducing him to Mrs.\r\nFarrinder. Ransom consented, with a little of his Southern flourish, and\r\nin a moment the lady got up to receive him from the midst of the circle\r\nthat now surrounded her. It was an occasion for her to justify her\r\nreputation of an elegant manner, and it must be impartially related that\r\nshe struck Ransom as having a dignity in conversation and a command of\r\nthe noble style which could not have been surpassed by a daughter--one\r\nof the most accomplished, most far-descended daughters--of his own\r\nlatitude. It was as if she had known that he was not eager for the\r\nchanges she advocated, and wished to show him that, especially to a\r\nSoutherner who had bitten the dust, her sex could be magnanimous. This\r\nknowledge of his secret heresy seemed to him to be also in the faces of\r\nthe other ladies, whose circumspect glances, however (for he had not\r\nbeen introduced), treated it as a pity rather than as a shame. He was\r\nconscious of all these middle-aged feminine eyes, conscious of curls,\r\nrather limp, that depended from dusky bonnets, of heads poked forward,\r\nas if with a waiting, listening, familiar habit, of no one being very\r\nbright or gay--no one, at least, but that girl he had noticed before,\r\nwho had a brilliant head, and who now hovered on the edge of the\r\nconclave. He met her eye again; she was watching him too. It had been in\r\nhis thought that Mrs. Farrinder, to whom his cousin might have betrayed\r\nor misrepresented him, would perhaps defy him to combat, and he wondered\r\nwhether he could pull himself together (he was extremely embarrassed)\r\nsufficiently to do honour to such a challenge. If she would fling down\r\nthe glove on the temperance question, it seemed to him that it would be\r\nin him to pick it up; for the idea of a meddling legislation on this\r\nsubject filled him with rage; the taste of liquor being good to him, and\r\nhis conviction strong that civilisation itself would be in danger if it\r\nshould fall into the power of a herd of vociferating women (I am but the\r\nreporter of his angry _formulae_) to prevent a gentleman from taking his\r\nglass. Mrs. Farrinder proved to him that she had not the eagerness of\r\ninsecurity; she asked him if he wouldn\'t like to give the company some\r\naccount of the social and political condition of the South. He begged to\r\nbe excused, expressing at the same time a high sense of the honour done\r\nhim by such a request, while he smiled to himself at the idea of his\r\nextemporising a lecture. He smiled even while he suspected the meaning\r\nof the look Miss Chancellor gave him: "Well, you are not of much account\r\nafter all!" To talk to those people about the South--if they could have\r\nguessed how little he cared to do it! He had a passionate tenderness for\r\nhis own country, and a sense of intimate connexion with it which would\r\nhave made it as impossible for him to take a roomful of Northern\r\nfanatics into his confidence as to read aloud his mother\'s or his\r\nmistress\'s letters. To be quiet about the Southern land, not to touch\r\nher with vulgar hands, to leave her alone with her wounds and her\r\nmemories, not prating in the market-place either of her troubles or her\r\nhopes, but waiting as a man should wait, for the slow process, the\r\nsensible beneficence, of time--this was the desire of Ransom\'s heart,\r\nand he was aware of how little it could minister to the entertainment of\r\nMiss Birdseye\'s guests.\r\n\r\n"We know so little about the women of the South; they are very\r\nvoiceless," Mrs. Farrinder remarked. "How much can we count upon them?\r\nin what numbers would they flock to our standard? I have been\r\nrecommended not to lecture in the Southern cities."\r\n\r\n"Ah, madam, that was very cruel advice--for us!" Basil Ransom exclaimed,\r\nwith gallantry.\r\n\r\n"_I_ had a magnificent audience last spring in St. Louis," a fresh young\r\nvoice announced, over the heads of the gathered group--a voice which, on\r\nBasil\'s turning, like every one else, for an explanation, appeared to\r\nhave proceeded from the pretty girl with red hair. She had coloured a\r\nlittle with the effort of making this declaration, and she stood there\r\nsmiling at her listeners.\r\n\r\nMrs. Farrinder bent a benignant brow upon her, in spite of her being,\r\nevidently, rather a surprise. "Oh, indeed; and your subject, my dear\r\nyoung lady?"\r\n\r\n"The past history, the present condition, and the future prospects of\r\nour sex."\r\n\r\n"Oh, well, St. Louis--that\'s scarcely the South," said one of the\r\nladies.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure the young lady would have had equal success at Charleston or\r\nNew Orleans," Basil Ransom interposed.\r\n\r\n"Well, I wanted to go farther," the girl continued, "but I had no\r\nfriends. I have friends in St. Louis."\r\n\r\n"You oughtn\'t to want for them anywhere," said Mrs. Farrinder, in a\r\nmanner which, by this time, had quite explained her reputation. "I am\r\nacquainted with the loyalty of St. Louis."\r\n\r\n"Well, after that, you must let me introduce Miss Tarrant; she\'s\r\nperfectly dying to know you, Mrs. Farrinder." These words emanated from\r\none of the gentlemen, the young man with white hair, who had been\r\nmentioned to Ransom by Doctor Prance as a celebrated magazinist. He,\r\ntoo, up to this moment, had hovered in the background, but he now gently\r\nclove the assembly (several of the ladies made way for him), leading in\r\nthe daughter of the mesmerist.\r\n\r\nShe laughed and continued to blush--her blush was the faintest pink; she\r\nlooked very young and slim and fair as Mrs. Farrinder made way for her\r\non the sofa which Olive Chancellor had quitted. "I _have_ wanted to know\r\nyou; I admire you so much; I hoped so you would speak to-night. It\'s too\r\nlovely to see you, Mrs. Farrinder." So she expressed herself, while the\r\ncompany watched the encounter with a look of refreshed inanition. "You\r\ndon\'t know who I am, of course; I\'m just a girl who wants to thank you\r\nfor all you have done for us. For you have spoken for us girls, just as\r\nmuch as--just as much as----" She hesitated now, looking about with\r\nenthusiastic eyes at the rest of the group, and meeting once more the\r\ngaze of Basil Ransom.\r\n\r\n"Just as much as for the old women," said Mrs. Farrinder genially. "You\r\nseem very well able to speak for yourself."\r\n\r\n"She speaks so beautifully--if she would only make a little address,"\r\nthe young man who had introduced her remarked. "It\'s a new style, quite\r\noriginal," he added. He stood there with folded arms, looking down at\r\nhis work, the conjunction of the two ladies, with a smile; and Basil\r\nRansom, remembering what Miss Prance had told him, and enlightened by\r\nhis observation in New York of some of the sources from which newspapers\r\nare fed, was immediately touched by the conviction that he perceived in\r\nit the material of a paragraph.\r\n\r\n"My dear child, if you\'ll take the floor, I\'ll call the meeting to\r\norder," said Mrs. Farrinder.\r\n\r\nThe girl looked at her with extraordinary candour and confidence. "If I\r\ncould only hear you first--just to give me an atmosphere."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got no atmosphere; there\'s very little of the Indian summer about\r\n_me_! I deal with facts--hard facts," Mrs. Farrinder replied. "Have you\r\never heard me? If so, you know how crisp I am."\r\n\r\n"Heard you? I\'ve lived on you! It\'s so much to me to see you. Ask mother\r\nif it ain\'t!" She had expressed herself, from the first word she\r\nuttered, with a promptness and assurance which gave almost the\r\nimpression of a lesson rehearsed in advance. And yet there was a strange\r\nspontaneity in her manner, and an air of artless enthusiasm, of personal\r\npurity. If she was theatrical, she was naturally theatrical. She looked\r\nup at Mrs. Farrinder with all her emotion in her smiling eyes. This lady\r\nhad been the object of many ovations; it was familiar to her that the\r\ncollective heart of her sex had gone forth to her; but, visibly, she was\r\npuzzled by this unforeseen embodiment of gratitude and fluency, and her\r\neyes wandered over the girl with a certain reserve, while, within the\r\ndepth of her eminently public manner, she asked herself whether Miss\r\nTarrant were a remarkable young woman or only a forward minx. She found\r\na response which committed her to neither view; she only said, "We want\r\nthe young--of course we want the young!"\r\n\r\n"Who is that charming creature?" Basil Ransom heard his cousin ask, in a\r\ngrave, lowered tone, of Matthias Pardon, the young man who had brought\r\nMiss Tarrant forward. He didn\'t know whether Miss Chancellor knew him,\r\nor whether her curiosity had pushed her to boldness. Ransom was near the\r\npair, and had the benefit of Mr. Pardon\'s answer.\r\n\r\n"The daughter of Doctor Tarrant, the mesmeric healer--Miss Verena. She\'s\r\na high-class speaker."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?" Olive asked. "Does she give public addresses?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, she has had quite a career in the West. I heard her last spring\r\nat Topeka. They call it inspirational. I don\'t know what it is--only\r\nit\'s exquisite; so fresh and poetical. She has to have her father to\r\nstart her up. It seems to pass into her." And Mr. Pardon indulged in a\r\ngesture intended to signify the passage.\r\n\r\nOlive Chancellor made no rejoinder save a low, impatient sigh; she\r\ntransferred her attention to the girl, who now held Mrs. Farrinder\'s\r\nhand in both her own, and was pleading with her just to prelude a\r\nlittle. "I want a starting-point--I want to know where I am," she said.\r\n"Just two or three of your grand old thoughts."\r\n\r\nBasil stepped nearer to his cousin; he remarked to her that Miss Verena\r\nwas very pretty. She turned an instant, glanced at him, and then said,\r\n"Do you think so?" An instant later she added, "How you must hate this\r\nplace!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, not now, we are going to have some fun," Ransom replied\r\ngood-humouredly, if a trifle coarsely; and the declaration had a point,\r\nfor Miss Birdseye at this moment reappeared, followed by the mesmeric\r\nhealer and his wife.\r\n\r\n"Ah, well, I see you are drawing her out," said Miss Birdseye to Mrs.\r\nFarrinder; and at the idea that this process had been necessary Basil\r\nRansom broke into a smothered hilarity, a spasm which indicated that,\r\nfor him, the fun had already begun, and procured him another grave\r\nglance from Miss Chancellor. Miss Verena seemed to him as far "out" as a\r\nyoung woman could be. "Here\'s her father, Doctor Tarrant--he has a\r\nwonderful gift--and her mother--she was a daughter of Abraham\r\nGreenstreet." Miss Birdseye presented her companion; she was sure Mrs.\r\nFarrinder would be interested; she wouldn\'t want to lose an opportunity,\r\neven if for herself the conditions were not favourable. And then Miss\r\nBirdseye addressed herself to the company more at large, widening the\r\ncircle so as to take in the most scattered guests, and evidently feeling\r\nthat after all it was a relief that one happened to have an obscurely\r\ninspired maiden on the premises when greater celebrities had betrayed\r\nthe whimsicality of genius. It was a part of this whimsicality that Mrs.\r\nFarrinder--the reader may find it difficult to keep pace with her\r\nvariations--appeared now to have decided to utter a few of her thoughts,\r\nso that her hostess could elicit a general response to the remark that\r\nit would be delightful to have both the old school and the new.\r\n\r\n"Well, perhaps you\'ll be disappointed in Verena," said Mrs. Tarrant,\r\nwith an air of dolorous resignation to any event, and seating herself,\r\nwith her gathered mantle, on the edge of a chair, as if she, at least,\r\nwere ready, whoever else might keep on talking.\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t _me_, mother," Verena rejoined, with soft gravity, rather\r\ndetached now from Mrs. Farrinder, and sitting with her eyes fixed\r\nthoughtfully on the ground. With deference to Mrs. Tarrant, a little\r\nmore talk was necessary, for the young lady had as yet been\r\ninsufficiently explained. Miss Birdseye felt this, but she was rather\r\nhelpless about it, and delivered herself, with her universal\r\nfamiliarity, which embraced every one and everything, of a wandering,\r\namiable tale, in which Abraham Greenstreet kept reappearing, in which\r\nDoctor Tarrant\'s miraculous cures were specified, with all the facts\r\nwanting, and in which Verena\'s successes in the West were related, not\r\nwith emphasis or hyperbole, in which Miss Birdseye never indulged, but\r\nas accepted and recognised wonders, natural in an age of new\r\nrevelations. She had heard of these things in detail only ten minutes\r\nbefore, from the girl\'s parents, but her hospitable soul had needed but\r\na moment to swallow and assimilate them. If her account of them was not\r\nvery lucid, it should be said in excuse for her that it was impossible\r\nto have any idea of Verena Tarrant unless one had heard her, and\r\ntherefore still more impossible to give an idea to others. Mrs.\r\nFarrinder was perceptibly irritated; she appeared to have made up her\r\nmind, after her first hesitation, that the Tarrant family were\r\nfantastical and compromising. She had bent an eye of coldness on Selah\r\nand his wife--she might have regarded them all as a company of\r\nmountebanks.\r\n\r\n"Stand up and tell us what you have to say," she remarked, with some\r\nsternness, to Verena, who only raised her eyes to her, silently now,\r\nwith the same sweetness, and then rested them on her father. This\r\ngentleman seemed to respond to an irresistible appeal; he looked round\r\nat the company with all his teeth, and said that these flattering\r\nallusions were not so embarrassing as they might otherwise be, inasmuch\r\nas any success that he and his daughter might have had was so thoroughly\r\nimpersonal: he insisted on that word. They had just heard her say, "It\r\nis not _me_, mother," and he and Mrs. Tarrant and the girl herself were\r\nall equally aware it was not she. It was some power outside--it seemed\r\nto flow through her; he couldn\'t pretend to say why his daughter should\r\nbe called, more than any one else. But it seemed as if she _was_ called.\r\nWhen he just calmed her down by laying his hand on her a few moments, it\r\nseemed to come. It so happened that in the West it had taken the form of\r\na considerable eloquence. She had certainly spoken with great facility\r\nto cultivated and high-minded audiences. She had long followed with\r\nsympathy the movement for the liberation of her sex from every sort of\r\nbondage; it had been her principal interest even as a child (he might\r\nmention that at the age of nine she had christened her favourite doll\r\nEliza P. Moseley, in memory of a great precursor whom they all\r\nreverenced), and now the inspiration, if he might call it so, seemed\r\njust to flow in that channel. The voice that spoke from her lips seemed\r\nto want to take that form. It didn\'t seem as if it _could_ take any\r\nother. She let it come out just as it would--she didn\'t pretend to have\r\nany control. They could judge for themselves whether the whole thing was\r\nnot quite unique. That was why he was willing to talk about his own\r\nchild that way, before a gathering of ladies and gentlemen; it was\r\nbecause they took no credit--they felt it was a power outside. If Verena\r\nfelt she was going to be stimulated that evening, he was pretty sure\r\nthey would be interested. Only he should have to request a few moments\'\r\nsilence, while she listened for the voice.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the ladies declared that they should be delighted--they hoped\r\nthat Miss Tarrant was in good trim; whereupon they were corrected by\r\nothers, who reminded them that it wasn\'t _her_--she had nothing to do\r\nwith it--so her trim didn\'t matter; and a gentleman added that he\r\nguessed there were many present who had conversed with Eliza P. Moseley.\r\nMeanwhile Verena, more and more withdrawn into herself, but perfectly\r\nundisturbed by the public discussion of her mystic faculty, turned yet\r\nagain, very prettily, to Mrs. Farrinder, and asked her if she wouldn\'t\r\nstrike out--just to give her courage. By this time Mrs. Farrinder was in\r\na condition of overhanging gloom; she greeted the charming suppliant\r\nwith the frown of Juno. She disapproved completely of Doctor Tarrant\'s\r\nlittle speech, and she had less and less disposition to be associated\r\nwith a miracle-monger. Abraham Greenstreet was very well, but Abraham\r\nGreenstreet was in his grave; and Eliza P. Moseley, after all, had been\r\nvery tepid. Basil Ransom wondered whether it were effrontery or\r\ninnocence that enabled Miss Tarrant to meet with such complacency the\r\naloofness of the elder lady. At this moment he heard Olive Chancellor,\r\nat his elbow, with the tremor of excitement in her tone, suddenly\r\nexclaim: "Please begin, please begin! A voice, a human voice, is what we\r\nwant."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll speak after you, and if you\'re a humbug, I\'ll expose you!" Mrs.\r\nFarrinder said. She was more majestic than facetious.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure we are all solid, as Doctor Tarrant says. I suppose we want to\r\nbe quiet," Miss Birdseye remarked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nVerena Tarrant got up and went to her father in the middle of the room;\r\nOlive Chancellor crossed and resumed her place beside Mrs. Farrinder on\r\nthe sofa the girl had quitted; and Miss Birdseye\'s visitors, for the\r\nrest, settled themselves attentively in chairs or leaned against the\r\nbare sides of the parlour. Verena took her father\'s hands, held them for\r\na moment, while she stood before him, not looking at him, with her eyes\r\ntowards the company; then, after an instant, her mother, rising, pushed\r\nforward, with an interesting sigh, the chair on which she had been\r\nsitting. Mrs. Tarrant was provided with another seat, and Verena,\r\nrelinquishing her father\'s grasp, placed herself in the chair, which\r\nTarrant put in position for her. She sat there with closed eyes, and her\r\nfather now rested his long, lean hands upon her head. Basil Ransom\r\nwatched these proceedings with much interest, for the girl amused and\r\npleased him. She had far more colour than any one there, for whatever\r\nbrightness was to be found in Miss Birdseye\'s rather faded and dingy\r\nhuman collection had gathered itself into this attractive but ambiguous\r\nyoung person. There was nothing ambiguous, by the way, about her\r\nconfederate; Ransom simply loathed him, from the moment he opened his\r\nmouth; he was intensely familiar--that is, his type was; he was simply\r\nthe detested carpet-bagger. He was false, cunning, vulgar, ignoble; the\r\ncheapest kind of human product. That he should be the father of a\r\ndelicate, pretty girl, who was apparently clever too, whether she had a\r\ngift or no, this was an annoying, disconcerting fact. The white, puffy\r\nmother, with the high forehead, in the corner there, looked more like a\r\nlady; but if she were one, it was all the more shame to her to have\r\nmated with such a varlet, Ransom said to himself, making use, as he did\r\ngenerally, of terms of opprobrium extracted from the older English\r\nliterature. He had seen Tarrant, or his equivalent, often before; he had\r\n"whipped" him, as he believed, controversially, again and again, at\r\npolitical meetings in blighted Southern towns, during the horrible\r\nperiod of reconstruction. If Mrs. Farrinder had looked at Verena Tarrant\r\nas if she were a mountebank, there was some excuse for it, inasmuch as\r\nthe girl made much the same impression on Basil Ransom. He had never\r\nseen such an odd mixture of elements; she had the sweetest, most\r\nunworldly face, and yet, with it, an air of being on exhibition, of\r\nbelonging to a troupe, of living in the gaslight, which pervaded even\r\nthe details of her dress, fashioned evidently with an attempt at the\r\nhistrionic. If she had produced a pair of castanets or a tambourine, he\r\nfelt that such accessories would have been quite in keeping.\r\n\r\nLittle Doctor Prance, with her hard good sense, had noted that she was\r\nan\xe6mic, and had intimated that she was a deceiver. The value of her\r\nperformance was yet to be proved, but she was certainly very pale, white\r\nas women are who have that shade of red hair; they look as if their\r\nblood had gone into it. There was, however, something rich in the\r\nfairness of this young lady; she was strong and supple, there was colour\r\nin her lips and eyes, and her tresses, gathered into a complicated coil,\r\nseemed to glow with the brightness of her nature. She had curious,\r\nradiant, liquid eyes (their smile was a sort of reflexion, like the\r\nglisten of a gem), and though she was not tall, she appeared to spring\r\nup, and carried her head as if it reached rather high. Ransom would have\r\nthought she looked like an Oriental, if it were not that Orientals are\r\ndark; and if she had only had a goat she would have resembled Esmeralda,\r\nthough he had but a vague recollection of who Esmeralda had been. She\r\nwore a light-brown dress, of a shape that struck him as fantastic, a\r\nyellow petticoat, and a large crimson sash fastened at the side; while\r\nround her neck, and falling low upon her flat young chest, she had a\r\ndouble chain of amber beads. It must be added that, in spite of her\r\nmelodramatic appearance, there was no symptom that her performance,\r\nwhatever it was, would be of a melodramatic character. She was very\r\nquiet now, at least (she had folded her big fan), and her father\r\ncontinued the mysterious process of calming her down. Ransom wondered\r\nwhether he wouldn\'t put her to sleep; for some minutes her eyes had\r\nremained closed; he heard a lady near him, apparently familiar with\r\nphenomena of this class, remark that she was going off. As yet the\r\nexhibition was not exciting, though it was certainly pleasant to have\r\nsuch a pretty girl placed there before one, like a moving statue. Doctor\r\nTarrant looked at no one as he stroked and soothed his daughter; his\r\neyes wandered round the cornice of the room, and he grinned upward, as\r\nif at an imaginary gallery. "Quietly--quietly," he murmured from time to\r\ntime. "It will come, my good child, it will come. Just let it work--just\r\nlet it gather. The spirit, you know; you\'ve got to let the spirit come\r\nout when it will." He threw up his arms at moments, to rid himself of\r\nthe wings of his long waterproof, which fell forward over his hands.\r\nBasil Ransom noticed all these things, and noticed also, opposite, the\r\nwaiting face of his cousin, fixed, from her sofa, upon the closed eyes\r\nof the young prophetess. He grew more impatient at last, not of the\r\ndelay of the edifying voice (though some time had elapsed), but of\r\nTarrant\'s grotesque manipulations, which he resented as much as if he\r\nhimself had felt their touch, and which seemed a dishonour to the\r\npassive maiden. They made him nervous, they made him angry, and it was\r\nonly afterwards that he asked himself wherein they concerned him, and\r\nwhether even a carpet-bagger hadn\'t a right to do what he pleased with\r\nhis daughter. It was a relief to him when Verena got up from her chair,\r\nwith a movement which made Tarrant drop into the background as if his\r\npart were now over. She stood there with a quiet face, serious and\r\nsightless; then, after a short further delay, she began to speak.\r\n\r\nShe began incoherently, almost inaudibly, as if she were talking in a\r\ndream. Ransom could not understand her; he thought it very queer, and\r\nwondered what Doctor Prance would have said. "She\'s just arranging her\r\nideas, and trying to get in report; she\'ll come out all right." This\r\nremark he heard dropped in a low tone by the mesmeric healer; "in\r\nreport" was apparently Tarrant\'s version of _en rapport_. His prophecy\r\nwas verified, and Verena did come out, after a little; she came out with\r\na great deal of sweetness--with a very quaint and peculiar effect. She\r\nproceeded slowly, cautiously, as if she were listening for the prompter,\r\ncatching, one by one, certain phrases that were whispered to her a great\r\ndistance off, behind the scenes of the world. Then memory, or\r\ninspiration, returned to her, and presently she was in possession of her\r\npart. She played it with extraordinary simplicity and grace; at the end\r\nof ten minutes Ransom became aware that the whole audience--Mrs.\r\nFarrinder, Miss Chancellor, and the tough subject from Mississippi--were\r\nunder the charm. I speak of ten minutes, but to tell the truth the young\r\nman lost all sense of time. He wondered afterwards how long she had\r\nspoken; then he counted that her strange, sweet, crude, absurd,\r\nenchanting improvisation must have lasted half an hour. It was not what\r\nshe said; he didn\'t care for that, he scarcely understood it; he could\r\nonly see that it was all about the gentleness and goodness of women, and\r\nhow, during the long ages of history, they had been trampled under the\r\niron heel of man. It was about their equality--perhaps even (he was not\r\ndefinitely conscious) about their superiority. It was about their day\r\nhaving come at last, about the universal sisterhood, about their duty to\r\nthemselves and to each other. It was about such matters as these, and\r\nBasil Ransom was delighted to observe that such matters as these didn\'t\r\nspoil it. The effect was not in what she said, though she said some such\r\npretty things, but in the picture and figure of the half-bedizened\r\ndamsel (playing, now again, with her red fan), the visible freshness and\r\npurity of the little effort. When she had gained confidence she opened\r\nher eyes, and their shining softness was half the effect of her\r\ndiscourse. It was full of school-girl phrases, of patches of remembered\r\neloquence, of childish lapses of logic, of flights of fancy which might\r\nindeed have had success at Topeka; but Ransom thought that if it had\r\nbeen much worse it would have been quite as good, for the argument, the\r\ndoctrine, had absolutely nothing to do with it. It was simply an\r\nintensely personal exhibition, and the person making it happened to be\r\nfascinating. She might have offended the taste of certain people--Ransom\r\ncould imagine that there were other Boston circles in which she would be\r\nthought pert; but for himself all he could feel was that to _his_\r\nstarved senses she irresistibly appealed. He was the stiffest of\r\nconservatives, and his mind was steeled against the inanities she\r\nuttered--the rights and wrongs of women, the equality of the sexes, the\r\nhysterics of conventions, the further stultification of the suffrage,\r\nthe prospect of conscript mothers in the national Senate. It made no\r\ndifference; she didn\'t mean it, she didn\'t know what she meant, she had\r\nbeen stuffed with this trash by her father, and she was neither more nor\r\nless willing to say it than to say anything else; for the necessity of\r\nher nature was not to make converts to a ridiculous cause, but to emit\r\nthose charming notes of her voice, to stand in those free young\r\nattitudes, to shake her braided locks like a naiad rising from the\r\nwaves, to please every one who came near her, and to be happy that she\r\npleased. I know not whether Ransom was aware of the bearings of this\r\ninterpretation, which attributed to Miss Tarrant a singular hollowness\r\nof character; he contented himself with believing that she was as\r\ninnocent as she was lovely, and with regarding her as a vocalist of\r\nexquisite faculty, condemned to sing bad music. How prettily, indeed,\r\nshe made some of it sound!\r\n\r\n"Of course I only speak to women--to my own dear sisters; I don\'t speak\r\nto men, for I don\'t expect them to like what I say. They pretend to\r\nadmire us very much, but I should like them to admire us a little less\r\nand to trust us a little more. I don\'t know what we have ever done to\r\nthem that they should keep us out of everything. We have trusted _them_\r\ntoo much, and I think the time has come now for us to judge them, and\r\nsay that by keeping us out we don\'t think they have done so well. When I\r\nlook around me at the world, and at the state that men have brought it\r\nto, I confess I say to myself, "Well, if women had fixed it this way I\r\nshould like to know what they would think of it!" When I see the\r\ndreadful misery of mankind and think of the suffering of which at any\r\nhour, at any moment, the world is full, I say that if this is the best\r\nthey can do by themselves, they had better let us come in a little and\r\nsee what _we_ can do. We couldn\'t possibly make it worse, could we? If\r\nwe had done only this, we shouldn\'t boast of it. Poverty, and ignorance,\r\nand crime; disease, and wickedness, and wars! Wars, always more wars,\r\nand always more and more. Blood, blood--the world is drenched with\r\nblood! To kill each other, with all sorts of expensive and perfected\r\ninstruments, that is the most brilliant thing they have been able to\r\ninvent. It seems to me that we might stop it, we might invent something\r\nbetter. The cruelty--the cruelty; there is so much, so much! Why\r\nshouldn\'t tenderness come in? Why should our woman\'s hearts be so full\r\nof it, and all so wasted and withered, while armies and prisons and\r\nhelpless miseries grow greater all the while? I am only a girl, a simple\r\nAmerican girl, and of course I haven\'t seen much, and there is a great\r\ndeal of life that I don\'t know anything about. But there are some things\r\nI feel--it seems to me as if I had been born to feel them; they are in\r\nmy ears in the stillness of the night and before my face in the visions\r\nof the darkness. It is what the great sisterhood of women might do if\r\nthey should all join hands, and lift up their voices above the brutal\r\nuproar of the world, in which it is so hard for the plea of mercy or of\r\njustice, the moan of weakness and suffering, to be heard. We should\r\nquench it, we should make it still, and the sound of our lips would\r\nbecome the voice of universal peace! For this we must trust one another,\r\nwe must be true and gentle and kind. We must remember that the world is\r\nours too, ours--little as we have ever had to say about anything!--and\r\nthat the question is _not_ yet definitely settled whether it shall be a\r\nplace of injustice or a place of love!"\r\n\r\nIt was with this that the young lady finished her harangue, which was\r\nnot followed by her sinking exhausted into her chair or by any of the\r\ntraces of a laboured climax. She only turned away slowly towards her\r\nmother, smiling over her shoulder at the whole room, as if it had been a\r\nsingle person, without a flush in her whiteness, or the need of drawing\r\na longer breath. The performance had evidently been very easy to her,\r\nand there might have been a kind of impertinence in her air of not\r\nhaving suffered from an exertion which had wrought so powerfully on\r\nevery one else. Ransom broke into a genial laugh, which he instantly\r\nswallowed again, at the sweet grotesqueness of this virginal creature\'s\r\nstanding up before a company of middle-aged people to talk to them about\r\n"love," the note on which she had closed her harangue. It was the most\r\ncharming touch in the whole thing, and the most vivid proof of her\r\ninnocence. She had had immense success, and Mrs. Tarrant, as she took\r\nher into her arms and kissed her, was certainly able to feel that the\r\naudience was not disappointed. They were exceedingly affected; they\r\nbroke into exclamations and murmurs. Selah Tarrant went on conversing\r\nostentatiously with his neighbours, slowly twirling his long thumbs and\r\nlooking up at the cornice again, as if there could be nothing in the\r\nbrilliant manner in which his daughter had acquitted herself to surprise\r\n_him_, who had heard her when she was still more remarkable, and who,\r\nmoreover, remembered that the affair was so impersonal. Miss Birdseye\r\nlooked round at the company with dim exultation; her large mild cheeks\r\nwere shining with unwiped tears. Young Mr. Pardon remarked, in Ransom\'s\r\nhearing, that he knew parties who, if they had been present, would want\r\nto engage Miss Verena at a high figure for the winter campaign. And\r\nRansom heard him add in a lower tone: "There\'s money for some one in\r\nthat girl; you see if she don\'t have quite a run!" As for our\r\nMississippian he kept his agreeable sensation for himself, only\r\nwondering whether he might not ask Miss Birdseye to present him to the\r\nheroine of the evening. Not immediately, of course, for the young man\r\nmingled with his Southern pride a shyness which often served all the\r\npurpose of humility. He was aware how much he was an outsider in such a\r\nhouse as that, and he was ready to wait for his coveted satisfaction\r\ntill the others, who all hung together, should have given her the\r\nassurance of an approval which she would value, naturally, more than\r\nanything he could say to her. This episode had imparted animation to the\r\nassembly; a certain gaiety, even, expressed in a higher pitch of\r\nconversation, seemed to float in the heated air. People circulated more\r\nfreely, and Verena Tarrant was presently hidden from Ransom\'s sight by\r\nthe close-pressed ranks of the new friends she had made. "Well, I never\r\nheard it put _that_ way!" Ransom heard one of the ladies exclaim; to\r\nwhich another replied that she wondered one of their bright women hadn\'t\r\nthought of it before. "Well, it _is_ a gift, and no mistake," and "Well,\r\nthey may call it what they please, it\'s a pleasure to listen to\r\nit"--these genial tributes fell from the lips of a pair of ruminating\r\ngentlemen. It was affirmed within Ransom\'s hearing that if they had a\r\nfew more like that the matter would soon be fixed; and it was rejoined\r\nthat they couldn\'t expect to have a great many--the style was so\r\npeculiar. It was generally admitted that the style was peculiar, but\r\nMiss Tarrant\'s peculiarity was the explanation of her success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\n\r\nRansom approached Mrs. Farrinder again, who had remained on her sofa\r\nwith Olive Chancellor; and as she turned her face to him he saw that she\r\nhad felt the universal contagion. Her keen eye sparkled, there was a\r\nflush on her matronly cheek, and she had evidently made up her mind what\r\nline to take. Olive Chancellor sat motionless; her eyes were fixed on\r\nthe floor with the rigid, alarmed expression of her moments of nervous\r\ndiffidence; she gave no sign of observing her kinsman\'s approach. He\r\nsaid something to Mrs. Farrinder, something that imperfectly represented\r\nhis admiration of Verena; and this lady replied with dignity that it was\r\nno wonder the girl spoke so well--she spoke in such a good cause. "She\r\nis very graceful, has a fine command of language; her father says it\'s a\r\nnatural gift." Ransom saw that he should not in the least discover Mrs.\r\nFarrinder\'s real opinion, and her dissimulation added to his impression\r\nthat she was a woman with a policy. It was none of his business whether\r\nin her heart she thought Verena a parrot or a genius; it was perceptible\r\nto him that she saw she would be effective, would help the cause. He\r\nstood almost appalled for a moment, as he said to himself that she would\r\ntake her up and the girl would be ruined, would force her note and\r\nbecome a screamer. But he quickly dodged this vision, taking refuge in a\r\nmechanical appeal to his cousin, of whom he inquired how she liked Miss\r\nVerena. Olive made no answer; her head remained averted, she bored the\r\ncarpet with her conscious eyes. Mrs. Farrinder glanced at her askance,\r\nand then said to Ransom serenely:\r\n\r\n"You praise the grace of your Southern ladies, but you have had to come\r\nNorth to see a human gazelle. Miss Tarrant is of the best New England\r\nstock--what _I_ call the best!"\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure from what I have seen of the Boston ladies, no manifestation\r\nof grace can excite my surprise," Ransom rejoined, looking, with his\r\nsmile, at his cousin.\r\n\r\n"She has been powerfully affected," Mrs. Farrinder explained, very\r\nslightly dropping her voice, as Olive, apparently, still remained deaf.\r\n\r\nMiss Birdseye drew near at this moment; she wanted to know if Mrs.\r\nFarrinder didn\'t want to express some acknowledgment, on the part of the\r\ncompany at large, for the real stimulus Miss Tarrant had given them.\r\nMrs. Farrinder said: Oh yes, she would speak now with pleasure; only she\r\nmust have a glass of water first. Miss Birdseye replied that there was\r\nsome coming in a moment; one of the ladies had asked for it, and Mr.\r\nPardon had just stepped down to draw some. Basil took advantage of this\r\nintermission to ask Miss Birdseye if she would give him the great\r\nprivilege of an introduction to Miss Verena. "Mrs. Farrinder will thank\r\nher for the company," he said, laughing, "but she won\'t thank her for\r\nme."\r\n\r\nMiss Birdseye manifested the greatest disposition to oblige him; she was\r\nso glad he had been impressed. She was proceeding to lead him toward\r\nMiss Tarrant when Olive Chancellor rose abruptly from her chair and laid\r\nher hand, with an arresting movement, on the arm of her hostess. She\r\nexplained to her that she must go, that she was not very well, that her\r\ncarriage was there; also that she hoped Miss Birdseye, if it was not\r\nasking too much, would accompany her to the door.\r\n\r\n"Well, you are impressed too," said Miss Birdseye, looking at her\r\nphilosophically. "It seems as if no one had escaped."\r\n\r\nRansom was disappointed; he saw he was going to be taken away, and,\r\nbefore he could suppress it, an exclamation burst from his lips--the\r\nfirst exclamation he could think of that would perhaps check his\r\ncousin\'s retreat: "Ah, Miss Olive, are you going to give up Mrs.\r\nFarrinder?"\r\n\r\nAt this Miss Olive looked at him, showed him an extraordinary face, a\r\nface he scarcely understood or even recognised. It was portentously\r\ngrave, the eyes were enlarged, there was a red spot in each of the\r\ncheeks, and as directed to him, a quick, piercing question, a kind of\r\nleaping challenge, in the whole expression. He could only answer this\r\nsudden gleam with a stare, and wonder afresh what trick his Northern\r\nkinswoman was destined to play him. Impressed too? He should think he\r\nhad been! Mrs. Farrinder, who was decidedly a woman of the world, came\r\nto his assistance, or to Miss Chancellor\'s, and said she hoped very much\r\nOlive wouldn\'t stay--she felt these things too much. "If you stay, I\r\nwon\'t speak," she added; "I should upset you altogether." And then she\r\ncontinued, tenderly, for so preponderantly intellectual a nature: "When\r\nwomen feel as you do, how can I doubt that we shall come out all right?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, we shall come out all right, I guess," murmured Miss Birdseye.\r\n\r\n"But you must remember Beacon Street," Mrs. Farrinder subjoined. "You\r\nmust take advantage of your position--you must wake up the Back Bay!"\r\n\r\n"I\'m sick of the Back Bay!" said Olive fiercely; and she passed to the\r\ndoor with Miss Birdseye, bidding good-bye to no one. She was so agitated\r\nthat, evidently, she could not trust herself, and there was nothing for\r\nRansom but to follow. At the door of the room, however, he was checked\r\nby a sudden pause on the part of the two ladies: Olive stopped and stood\r\nthere hesitating. She looked round the room and spied out Verena, where\r\nshe sat with her mother, the centre of a gratified group; then, throwing\r\nback her head with an air of decision, she crossed over to her. Ransom\r\nsaid to himself that now, perhaps, was his chance, and he quickly\r\naccompanied Miss Chancellor. The little knot of reformers watched her as\r\nshe arrived; their faces expressed a suspicion of her social importance,\r\nmingled with conscientious scruples as to whether it were right to\r\nrecognise it. Verena Tarrant saw that she was the object of this\r\nmanifestation, and she got up to meet the lady whose approach was so\r\nfull of point. Ransom perceived, however, or thought he perceived, that\r\nshe recognised nothing; she had no suspicions of social importance. Yet\r\nshe smiled with all her radiance, as she looked from Miss Chancellor to\r\nhim; smiled because she liked to smile, to please, to feel her\r\nsuccess--or was it because she was a perfect little actress, and this\r\nwas part of her training? She took the hand that Olive put out to her;\r\nthe others, rather solemnly, sat looking up from their chairs.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t know me, but I want to know you," Olive said. "I can thank\r\nyou now. Will you come and see me?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes; where do you live?" Verena answered, in the tone of a girl for\r\nwhom an invitation (she hadn\'t so many) was always an invitation.\r\n\r\nMiss Chancellor syllabled her address, and Mrs. Tarrant came forward,\r\nsmiling. "I know about you, Miss Chancellor. I guess your father knew my\r\nfather--Mr. Greenstreet. Verena will be very glad to visit you. We shall\r\nbe very happy to see you in _our_ home."\r\n\r\nBasil Ransom, while the mother spoke, wanted to say something to the\r\ndaughter, who stood there so near him, but he could think of nothing\r\nthat would do; certain words that came to him, his Mississippi phrases,\r\nseemed patronising and ponderous. Besides, he didn\'t wish to assent to\r\nwhat she had said; he wished simply to tell her she was delightful, and\r\nit was difficult to mark that difference. So he only smiled at her in\r\nsilence, and she smiled back at him--a smile that seemed to him quite\r\nfor himself.\r\n\r\n"Where do you live?" Olive asked; and Mrs. Tarrant replied that they\r\nlived at Cambridge, and that the horse-cars passed just near their door.\r\nWhereupon Olive insisted "Will you come very soon?" and Verena said, Oh\r\nyes, she would come very soon, and repeated the number in Charles\r\nStreet, to show that she had taken heed of it. This was done with\r\nchildlike good faith. Ransom saw that she would come and see any one who\r\nwould ask her like that, and he regretted for a minute that he was not a\r\nBoston lady, so that he might extend to her such an invitation. Olive\r\nChancellor held her hand a moment longer, looked at her in farewell, and\r\nthen, saying, "Come, Mr. Ransom," drew him out of the room. In the hall\r\nthey met Mr. Pardon, coming up from the lower regions with a jug of\r\nwater and a tumbler. Miss Chancellor\'s hackney-coach was there, and when\r\nBasil had put her into it she said to him that she wouldn\'t trouble him\r\nto drive with her--his hotel was not near Charles Street. He had so\r\nlittle desire to sit by her side--he wanted to smoke--that it was only\r\nafter the vehicle had rolled off that he reflected upon her coolness,\r\nand asked himself why the deuce she had brought him away. She _was_ a\r\nvery odd cousin, was this Boston cousin of his. He stood there a moment,\r\nlooking at the light in Miss Birdseye\'s windows and greatly minded to\r\nre-enter the house, now he might speak to the girl. But he contented\r\nhimself with the memory of her smile, and turned away with a sense of\r\nrelief, after all, at having got out of such wild company, as well as\r\nwith (in a different order) a vulgar consciousness of being very\r\nthirsty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\n\r\nVerena Tarrant came in the very next day from Cambridge to Charles\r\nStreet; that quarter of Boston is in direct communication with the\r\nacademic suburb. It hardly seemed direct to poor Verena, perhaps, who,\r\nin the crowded street-car which deposited her finally at Miss\r\nChancellor\'s door, had to stand up all the way, half suspended by a\r\nleathern strap from the glazed roof of the stifling vehicle, like some\r\nblooming cluster dangling in a hothouse. She was used, however, to these\r\nperpendicular journeys, and though, as we have seen, she was not\r\ninclined to accept without question the social arrangements of her time,\r\nit never would have occurred to her to criticise the railways of her\r\nnative land. The promptness of her visit to Olive Chancellor had been an\r\nidea of her mother\'s, and Verena listened open-eyed while this lady, in\r\nthe seclusion of the little house in Cambridge, while Selah Tarrant was\r\n"off," as they said, with his patients, sketched out a line of conduct\r\nfor her. The girl was both submissive and unworldly, and she listened to\r\nher mother\'s enumeration of the possible advantages of an intimacy with\r\nMiss Chancellor as she would have listened to any other fairy-tale. It\r\nwas still a part of the fairy-tale when this zealous parent put on with\r\nher own hands Verena\'s smart hat and feather, buttoned her little jacket\r\n(the buttons were immense and gilt), and presented her with twenty cents\r\nto pay her car-fare.\r\n\r\nThere was never any knowing in advance how Mrs. Tarrant would take a\r\nthing, and even Verena, who, filially, was much less argumentative than\r\nin her civic and, as it were, public capacity, had a perception that her\r\nmother was queer. She was queer, indeed--a flaccid, relaxed, unhealthy,\r\nwhimsical woman, who still had a capacity to cling. What she clung to\r\nwas "society," and a position in the world which a secret whisper told\r\nher she had never had and a voice more audible reminded her she was in\r\ndanger of losing. To keep it, to recover it, to reconsecrate it, was the\r\nambition of her heart; this was one of the many reasons why Providence\r\nhad judged her worthy of having so wonderful a child. Verena was born\r\nnot only to lead their common sex out of bondage, but to remodel a\r\nvisiting-list which bulged and contracted in the wrong places, like a\r\ncountry-made garment. As the daughter of Abraham Greenstreet, Mrs.\r\nTarrant had passed her youth in the first Abolitionist circles, and she\r\nwas aware how much such a prospect was clouded by her union with a young\r\nman who had begun life as an itinerant vendor of lead-pencils (he had\r\ncalled at Mr. Greenstreet\'s door in the exercise of this function), had\r\nafterwards been for a while a member of the celebrated Cayuga community,\r\nwhere there were no wives, or no husbands, or something of that sort\r\n(Mrs. Tarrant could never remember), and had still later (though before\r\nthe development of the healing faculty) achieved distinction in the\r\nspiritualistic world. (He was an extraordinarily favoured medium, only\r\nhe had had to stop for reasons of which Mrs. Tarrant possessed her\r\nversion.) Even in a society much occupied with the effacement of\r\nprejudice there had been certain dim presumptions against this versatile\r\nbeing, who naturally had not wanted arts to ingratiate himself with Miss\r\nGreenstreet, her eyes, like his own, being fixed exclusively on the\r\nfuture. The young couple (he was considerably her elder) had gazed on\r\nthe future together until they found that the past had completely\r\nforsaken them and that the present offered but a slender foothold. Mrs.\r\nTarrant, in other words, incurred the displeasure of her family, who\r\ngave her husband to understand that, much as they desired to remove the\r\nshackles from the slave, there were kinds of behaviour which struck them\r\nas too unfettered. These had prevailed, to their thinking, at Cayuga,\r\nand they naturally felt it was no use for him to say that his residence\r\nthere had been (for him--the community still existed) but a momentary\r\nepisode, inasmuch as there was little more to be urged for the spiritual\r\npicnics and vegetarian camp-meetings in which the discountenanced pair\r\nnow sought consolation.\r\n\r\nSuch were the narrow views of people hitherto supposed capable of\r\nopening their hearts to all salutary novelties, but now put to a genuine\r\ntest, as Mrs. Tarrant felt. Her husband\'s tastes rubbed off on her soft,\r\nmoist moral surface, and the couple lived in an atmosphere of novelty,\r\nin which, occasionally, the accommodating wife encountered the fresh\r\nsensation of being in want of her dinner. Her father died, leaving,\r\nafter all, very little money; he had spent his modest fortune upon the\r\nblacks. Selah Tarrant and his companion had strange adventures; she\r\nfound herself completely enrolled in the great irregular army of\r\nnostrum-mongers, domiciled in humanitary Bohemia. It absorbed her like a\r\nsocial swamp; she sank into it a little more every day, without\r\nmeasuring the inches of her descent. Now she stood there up to her chin;\r\nit may probably be said of her that she had touched bottom. When she\r\nwent to Miss Birdseye\'s it seemed to her that she re-entered society.\r\nThe door that admitted her was not the door that admitted some of the\r\nothers (she should never forget the tipped-up nose of Mrs. Farrinder),\r\nand the superior portal remained ajar, disclosing possible vistas. She\r\nhad lived with long-haired men and short-haired women, she had\r\ncontributed a flexible faith and an irremediable want of funds to a\r\ndozen social experiments, she had partaken of the comfort of a hundred\r\nreligions, had followed innumerable dietary reforms, chiefly of the\r\nnegative order, and had gone of an evening to a _s\xe9ance_ or a lecture as\r\nregularly as she had eaten her supper. Her husband always had tickets\r\nfor lectures; in moments of irritation at the want of a certain sequence\r\nin their career, she had remarked to him that it was the only thing he\r\ndid have. The memory of all the winter nights they had tramped through\r\nthe slush (the tickets, alas! were not car-tickets) to hear Mrs. Ada T.\r\nP. Foat discourse on the "Summer-land," came back to her with\r\nbitterness. Selah was quite enthusiastic at one time about Mrs. Foat,\r\nand it was his wife\'s belief that he had been "associated" with her\r\n(that was Selah\'s expression in referring to such episodes) at Cayuga.\r\nThe poor woman, matrimonially, had a great deal to put up with; it took,\r\nat moments, all her belief in his genius to sustain her. She knew that\r\nhe was very magnetic (that, in fact, was his genius), and she felt that\r\nit was his magnetism that held her to him. He had carried her through\r\nthings where she really didn\'t know what to think; there were moments\r\nwhen she suspected that she had lost the strong moral sense for which\r\nthe Greenstreets were always so celebrated.\r\n\r\nOf course a woman who had had the bad taste to marry Selah Tarrant would\r\nnot have been likely under any circumstances to possess a very straight\r\njudgement; but there is no doubt that this poor lady had grown\r\ndreadfully limp. She had blinked and compromised and shuffled; she asked\r\nherself whether, after all, it was any more than natural that she should\r\nhave wanted to help her husband, in those exciting days of his\r\nmediumship, when the table, sometimes, wouldn\'t rise from the ground,\r\nthe sofa wouldn\'t float through the air, and the soft hand of a lost\r\nloved one was not so alert as it might have been to visit the circle.\r\nMrs. Tarrant\'s hand was soft enough for the most supernatural effect,\r\nand she consoled her conscience on such occasions by reflecting\r\nthat she ministered to a belief in immortality. She was glad,\r\nsomehow, for Verena\'s sake, that they had emerged from the phase of\r\nspirit-intercourse; her ambition for her daughter took another form than\r\ndesiring that she, too, should minister to a belief in immortality. Yet\r\namong Mrs. Tarrant\'s multifarious memories these reminiscences of the\r\ndarkened room, the waiting circle, the little taps on table and wall,\r\nthe little touches on cheek and foot, the music in the air, the rain of\r\nflowers, the sense of something mysteriously flitting, were most\r\ntenderly cherished. She hated her husband for having magnetised her so\r\nthat she consented to certain things, and even did them, the thought of\r\nwhich to-day would suddenly make her face burn; hated him for the manner\r\nin which, somehow, as she felt, he had lowered her social tone; yet at\r\nthe same time she admired him for an impudence so consummate that it had\r\nended (in the face of mortifications, exposures, failures, all the\r\nmisery of a hand-to-mouth existence) by imposing itself on her as a kind\r\nof infallibility. She knew he was an awful humbug, and yet her knowledge\r\nhad this imperfection, that he had never confessed it--a fact that was\r\nreally grand when one thought of his opportunities for doing so. He had\r\nnever allowed that he wasn\'t straight; the pair had so often been in the\r\nposition of the two augurs behind the altar, and yet he had never given\r\nher a glance that the whole circle mightn\'t have observed. Even in the\r\nprivacy of domestic intercourse he had phrases, excuses, explanations,\r\nways of putting things, which, as she felt, were too sublime for just\r\nherself; they were pitched, as Selah\'s nature was pitched, altogether in\r\nthe key of public life.\r\n\r\nSo it had come to pass, in her distended and demoralised conscience,\r\nthat with all the things she despised in her life and all the things she\r\nrather liked, between being worn out with her husband\'s inability to\r\nearn a living and a kind of terror of his consistency (he had a theory\r\nthat they lived delightfully), it happened, I say, that the only very\r\ndefinite criticism she made of him to-day was that he didn\'t know how to\r\nspeak. That was where the shoe pinched--that was where Selah was slim.\r\nHe couldn\'t hold the attention of an audience, he was not acceptable as\r\na lecturer. He had plenty of thoughts, but it seemed as if he couldn\'t\r\nfit them into each other. Public speaking had been a Greenstreet\r\ntradition, and if Mrs. Tarrant had been asked whether in her younger\r\nyears she had ever supposed she should marry a mesmeric healer, she\r\nwould have replied: "Well, I never thought I should marry a gentleman\r\nwho would be silent on the platform!" This was her most general\r\nhumiliation; it included and exceeded every other, and it was a poor\r\nconsolation that Selah possessed as a substitute--his career as a\r\nhealer, to speak of none other, was there to prove it--the eloquence of\r\nthe hand. The Greenstreets had never set much store on manual activity;\r\nthey believed in the influence of the lips. It may be imagined,\r\ntherefore, with what exultation, as time went on, Mrs. Tarrant found\r\nherself the mother of an inspired maiden, a young lady from whose lips\r\neloquence flowed in streams. The Greenstreet tradition would not perish,\r\nand the dry places of her life would, perhaps, be plentifully watered.\r\nIt must be added that, of late, this sandy surface had been irrigated,\r\nin moderation, from another source. Since Selah had addicted himself to\r\nthe mesmeric mystery, their home had been a little more what the home of\r\na Greenstreet should be. He had "considerable many" patients, he got\r\nabout two dollars a sitting, and he had effected some most gratifying\r\ncures. A lady in Cambridge had been so much indebted to him that she had\r\nrecently persuaded them to take a house near her, in order that Doctor\r\nTarrant might drop in at any time. He availed himself of this\r\nconvenience--they had taken so many houses that another, more or less,\r\ndidn\'t matter--and Mrs. Tarrant began to feel as if they really had\r\n"struck" something.\r\n\r\nEven to Verena, as we know, she was confused and confusing; the girl had\r\nnot yet had an opportunity to ascertain the principles on which her\r\nmother\'s limpness was liable suddenly to become rigid. This phenomenon\r\noccurred when the vapours of social ambition mounted to her brain, when\r\nshe extended an arm from which a crumpled dressing-gown fluttered back\r\nto seize the passing occasion. Then she surprised her daughter by a\r\nvolubility of exhortation as to the duty of making acquaintances, and by\r\nthe apparent wealth of her knowledge of the mysteries of good society.\r\nShe had, in particular, a way of explaining confidentially--and in her\r\ndesire to be graphic she often made up the oddest faces--the\r\ninterpretation that you must sometimes give to the manners of the best\r\npeople, and the delicate dignity with which you should meet them, which\r\nmade Verena wonder what secret sources of information she possessed.\r\nVerena took life, as yet, very simply; she was not conscious of so many\r\ndifferences of social complexion. She knew that some people were rich\r\nand others poor, and that her father\'s house had never been visited by\r\nsuch abundance as might make one ask one\'s self whether it were right,\r\nin a world so full of the disinherited, to roll in luxury. But except\r\nwhen her mother made her slightly dizzy by a resentment of some slight\r\nthat she herself had never perceived, or a flutter over some opportunity\r\nthat appeared already to have passed (while Mrs. Tarrant was looking for\r\nsomething to "put on"), Verena had no vivid sense that she was not as\r\ngood as any one else, for no authority appealing really to her\r\nimagination had fixed the place of mesmeric healers in the scale of\r\nfashion. It was impossible to know in advance how Mrs. Tarrant would\r\ntake things. Sometimes she was abjectly indifferent; at others she\r\nthought that every one who looked at her wished to insult her. At\r\nmoments she was full of suspicion of the ladies (they were mainly\r\nladies) whom Selah mesmerised; then again she appeared to have given up\r\neverything but her slippers and the evening-paper (from this publication\r\nshe derived inscrutable solace), so that if Mrs. Foat in person had\r\nreturned from the summer-land (to which she had some time since taken\r\nher flight), she would not have disturbed Mrs. Tarrant\'s almost cynical\r\nequanimity.\r\n\r\nIt was, however, in her social subtleties that she was most beyond her\r\ndaughter; it was when she discovered extraordinary though latent\r\nlongings on the part of people they met to make their acquaintance, that\r\nthe girl became conscious of how much she herself had still to learn.\r\nAll her desire was to learn, and it must be added that she regarded her\r\nmother, in perfect good faith, as a wonderful teacher. She was perplexed\r\nsometimes by her worldliness; that, somehow, was not a part of the\r\nhigher life which every one in such a house as theirs must wish above\r\nall things to lead; and it was not involved in the reign of justice,\r\nwhich they were all trying to bring about, that such a strict account\r\nshould be kept of every little snub. Her father seemed to Verena to move\r\nmore consecutively on the high plane; though his indifference to\r\nold-fashioned standards, his perpetual invocation of the brighter day,\r\nhad not yet led her to ask herself whether, after all, men are more\r\ndisinterested than women. Was it interest that prompted her mother to\r\nrespond so warmly to Miss Chancellor, to say to Verena, with an air of\r\nknowingness, that the thing to do was to go in and see her\r\n_immediately_? No italics can represent the earnestness of Mrs.\r\nTarrant\'s emphasis. Why hadn\'t she said, as she had done in former\r\ncases, that if people wanted to see them they could come out to their\r\nhome; that she was not so low down in the world as not to know there was\r\nsuch a ceremony as leaving cards? When Mrs. Tarrant began on the\r\nquestion of ceremonies she was apt to go far; but she had waived it in\r\nthis case; it suited her more to hold that Miss Chancellor had been very\r\ngracious, that she was a most desirable friend, that she had been more\r\naffected than any one by Verena\'s beautiful outpouring; that she would\r\nopen to her the best saloons in Boston; that when she said "Come soon"\r\nshe meant the very next day, that this was the way to take it, anyhow\r\n(one must know when to go forward gracefully); and that in short she,\r\nMrs. Tarrant, knew what she was talking about.\r\n\r\nVerena accepted all this, for she was young enough to enjoy any journey\r\nin a horse-car, and she was ever-curious about the world; she only\r\nwondered a little how her mother knew so much about Miss Chancellor just\r\nfrom looking at her once. What Verena had mainly observed in the young\r\nlady who came up to her that way the night before was that she was\r\nrather dolefully dressed, that she looked as if she had been crying\r\n(Verena recognised that look quickly, she had seen it so much), and that\r\nshe was in a hurry to get away. However, if she was as remarkable as her\r\nmother said, one would very soon see it; and meanwhile there was nothing\r\nin the girl\'s feeling about herself, in her sense of her importance, to\r\nmake it a painful effort for her to run the risk of a mistake. She had\r\nno particular feeling about herself; she only cared, as yet, for outside\r\nthings. Even the development of her "gift" had not made her think\r\nherself too precious for mere experiments; she had neither a particle of\r\ndiffidence nor a particle of vanity. Though it would have seemed to you\r\neminently natural that a daughter of Selah Tarrant and his wife should\r\nbe an inspirational speaker, yet, as you knew Verena better, you would\r\nhave wondered immensely how she came to issue from such a pair. Her\r\nideas of enjoyment were very simple; she enjoyed putting on her new hat,\r\nwith its redundancy of feather, and twenty cents appeared to her a very\r\nlarge sum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\n\r\n"I was certain you would come--I have felt it all day--something told\r\nme!" It was with these words that Olive Chancellor greeted her young\r\nvisitor, coming to her quickly from the window, where she might have\r\nbeen waiting for her arrival. Some weeks later she explained to Verena\r\nhow definite this prevision had been, how it had filled her all day with\r\na nervous agitation so violent as to be painful. She told her that such\r\nforebodings were a peculiarity of her organisation, that she didn\'t know\r\nwhat to make of them, that she had to accept them; and she mentioned, as\r\nanother example, the sudden dread that had come to her the evening\r\nbefore in the carriage, after proposing to Mr. Ransom to go with her to\r\nMiss Birdseye\'s. This had been as strange as it had been instinctive,\r\nand the strangeness, of course, was what must have struck Mr. Ransom;\r\nfor the idea that he might come had been hers, and yet she suddenly\r\nveered round. She couldn\'t help it; her heart had begun to throb with\r\nthe conviction that if he crossed that threshold some harm would come of\r\nof it for her. She hadn\'t prevented him, and now she didn\'t care, for\r\nnow, as she intimated, she had the interest of Verena, and that made her\r\nindifferent to every danger, to every ordinary pleasure. By this time\r\nVerena had learned how peculiarly her friend was constituted, how\r\nnervous and serious she was, how personal, how exclusive, what a force\r\nof will she had, what a concentration of purpose. Olive had taken her\r\nup, in the literal sense of the phrase, like a bird of the air, had\r\nspread an extraordinary pair of wings, and carried her through the\r\ndizzying void of space. Verena liked it, for the most part; liked to\r\nshoot upward without an effort of her own and look down upon all\r\ncreation, upon all history, from such a height. From this first\r\ninterview she felt that she was seized, and she gave herself up, only\r\nshutting her eyes a little, as we do whenever a person in whom we have\r\nperfect confidence proposes, with our assent, to subject us to some\r\nsensation.\r\n\r\n"I want to know you," Olive said, on this occasion; "I felt that I must\r\nlast night, as soon as I heard you speak. You seem to me very wonderful.\r\nI don\'t know what to make of you. I think we ought to be friends; so I\r\njust asked you to come to me straight off, without preliminaries, and I\r\nbelieved you would come. It is so _right_ that you have come, and it\r\nproves how right I was." These remarks fell from Miss Chancellor\'s lips\r\none by one, as she caught her breath, with the tremor that was always in\r\nher voice, even when she was the least excited, while she made Verena\r\nsit down near her on the sofa, and looked at her all over in a manner\r\nthat caused the girl to rejoice at having put on the jacket with the\r\ngilt buttons. It was this glance that was the beginning; it was with\r\nthis quick survey, omitting nothing, that Olive took possession of her.\r\n"You are very remarkable; I wonder if you know how remarkable!" she went\r\non, murmuring the words as if she were losing herself, becoming\r\ninadvertent in admiration.\r\n\r\nVerena sat there smiling, without a blush, but with a pure, bright look\r\nwhich, for her, would always make protests unnecessary. "Oh, it isn\'t\r\nme, you know; it\'s something outside!" She tossed this off lightly, as\r\nif she were in the habit of saying it, and Olive wondered whether it\r\nwere a sincere disclaimer or only a phrase of the lips. The question was\r\nnot a criticism, for she might have been satisfied that the girl was a\r\nmass of fluent catch-words and yet scarcely have liked her the less. It\r\nwas just as she was that she liked her; she was so strange, so different\r\nfrom the girls one usually met, seemed to belong to some queer\r\ngipsy-land or transcendental Bohemia. With her bright, vulgar clothes,\r\nher salient appearance, she might have been a rope-dancer or a\r\nfortune-teller; and this had the immense merit, for Olive, that it\r\nappeared to make her belong to the "people," threw her into the social\r\ndusk of that mysterious democracy which Miss Chancellor held that the\r\nfortunate classes know so little about, and with which (in a future\r\npossibly very near) they will have to count. Moreover, the girl had\r\nmoved her as she had never been moved, and the power to do that, from\r\nwhatever source it came, was a force that one must admire. Her emotion\r\nwas still acute, however much she might speak to her visitor as if\r\neverything that had happened seemed to her natural; and what kept it,\r\nabove all, from subsiding was her sense that she found here what she had\r\nbeen looking for so long--a friend of her own sex with whom she might\r\nhave a union of soul. It took a double consent to make a friendship, but\r\nit was not possible that this intensely sympathetic girl would refuse.\r\nOlive had the penetration to discover in a moment that she was a\r\ncreature of unlimited generosity. I know not what may have been the\r\nreality of Miss Chancellor\'s other premonitions, but there is no doubt\r\nthat in this respect she took Verena\'s measure on the spot. This was\r\nwhat she wanted; after that the rest didn\'t matter; Miss Tarrant might\r\nwear gilt buttons from head to foot, her soul could not be vulgar.\r\n\r\n"Mother told me I had better come right in," said Verena, looking now\r\nabout the room, very glad to find herself in so pleasant a place, and\r\nnoticing a great many things that she should like to see in detail.\r\n\r\n"Your mother saw that I meant what I said; it isn\'t everybody that does\r\nme the honour to perceive that. She saw that I was shaken from head to\r\nfoot. I could only say three words--I couldn\'t have spoken more! What a\r\npower--what a power, Miss Tarrant!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I suppose it is a power. If it wasn\'t a power, it couldn\'t do much\r\nwith me!"\r\n\r\n"You are so simple--so much like a child," Olive Chancellor said. That\r\nwas the truth, and she wanted to say it because, quickly, without forms\r\nor circumlocutions, it made them familiar. She wished to arrive at this;\r\nher impatience was such that before the girl had been five minutes in\r\nthe room she jumped to her point--inquired of her, interrupting herself,\r\ninterrupting everything: "Will you be my friend, my friend of friends,\r\nbeyond every one, everything, for ever and for ever?" Her face was full\r\nof eagerness and tenderness.\r\n\r\nVerena gave a laugh of clear amusement, without a shade of embarrassment\r\nor confusion. "Perhaps you like me too much."\r\n\r\n"Of course I like you too much! When I like, I like too much. But of\r\ncourse it\'s another thing, your liking me," Olive Chancellor added. "We\r\nmust wait--we must wait. When I care for anything, I can be patient."\r\nShe put out her hand to Verena, and the movement was at once so\r\nappealing and so confident that the girl instinctively placed her own in\r\nit. So, hand in hand, for some moments, these two young women sat\r\nlooking at each other. "There is so much I want to ask you," said Olive.\r\n\r\n"Well, I can\'t say much except when father has worked on me," Verena\r\nanswered with an ingenuousness beside which humility would have seemed\r\npretentious.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care anything about your father," Olive Chancellor rejoined\r\nvery gravely, with a great air of security.\r\n\r\n"He is very good," Verena said simply. "And he\'s wonderfully magnetic."\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t your father, and it isn\'t your mother; I don\'t think of them,\r\nand it\'s not them I want. It\'s only you--just as you are."\r\n\r\nVerena dropped her eyes over the front of her dress. "Just as she was"\r\nseemed to her indeed very well.\r\n\r\n"Do you want me to give up----?" she demanded, smiling.\r\n\r\nOlive Chancellor drew in her breath for an instant, like a creature in\r\npain; then, with her quavering voice, touched with a vibration of\r\nanguish, she said; "Oh, how can I ask you to give up? _I_ will give\r\nup--I will give up everything!"\r\n\r\nFilled with the impression of her hostess\'s agreeable interior, and of\r\nwhat her mother had told her about Miss Chancellor\'s wealth, her\r\nposition in Boston society, Verena, in her fresh, diverted scrutiny of\r\nthe surrounding objects, wondered what could be the need of this scheme\r\nof renunciation. Oh no, indeed, she hoped she wouldn\'t give up--at least\r\nnot before she, Verena, had had a chance to see. She felt, however, that\r\nfor the present there would be no answer for her save in the mere\r\npressure of Miss Chancellor\'s eager nature, that intensity of emotion\r\nwhich made her suddenly exclaim, as if in a nervous ecstasy of\r\nanticipation, "But we must wait! Why do we talk of this? We must wait!\r\nAll will be right," she added more calmly, with great sweetness.\r\n\r\nVerena wondered afterward why she had not been more afraid of her--why,\r\nindeed, she had not turned and saved herself by darting out of the room.\r\nBut it was not in this young woman\'s nature to be either timid or\r\ncautious; she had as yet to make acquaintance with the sentiment of\r\nfear. She knew too little of the world to have learned to mistrust\r\nsudden enthusiasms, and if she had had a suspicion it would have been\r\n(in accordance with common worldly knowledge) the wrong one--the\r\nsuspicion that such a whimsical liking would burn itself out. She could\r\nnot have that one, for there was a light in Miss Chancellor\'s magnified\r\nface which seemed to say that a sentiment, with her, might consume its\r\nobject, might consume Miss Chancellor, but would never consume itself.\r\nVerena, as yet, had no sense of being scorched; she was only agreeably\r\nwarmed. She also had dreamed of a friendship, though it was not what she\r\nhad dreamed of most, and it came over her that this was the one which\r\nfortune might have been keeping. She never held back.\r\n\r\n"Do you live here all alone?" she asked of Olive.\r\n\r\n"I shouldn\'t if you would come and live with me!"\r\n\r\nEven this really passionate rejoinder failed to make Verena shrink; she\r\nthought it so possible that in the wealthy class people made each other\r\nsuch easy proposals. It was a part of the romance, the luxury, of\r\nwealth; it belonged to the world of invitations, in which she had had so\r\nlittle share. But it seemed almost a mockery when she thought of the\r\nlittle house in Cambridge, where the boards were loose in the steps of\r\nthe porch.\r\n\r\n"I must stay with my father and mother," she said. "And then I have my\r\nwork, you know. That\'s the way I must live now."\r\n\r\n"Your work?" Olive repeated, not quite understanding.\r\n\r\n"My gift," said Verena, smiling.\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, you must use it. That\'s what I mean; you must move the world\r\nwith it; it\'s divine."\r\n\r\nIt was so much what she meant that she had lain awake all night thinking\r\nof it, and the substance of her thought was that if she could only\r\nrescue the girl from the danger of vulgar exploitation, could only\r\nconstitute herself her protectress and devotee, the two, between them,\r\nmight achieve the great result. Verena\'s genius was a mystery, and it\r\nmight remain a mystery; it was impossible to see how this charming,\r\nblooming, simple creature, all youth and grace and innocence, got her\r\nextraordinary powers of reflexion. When her gift was not in exercise she\r\nappeared anything but reflective, and as she sat there now, for\r\ninstance, you would never have dreamed that she had had a vivid\r\nrevelation. Olive had to content herself, provisionally, with saying\r\nthat her precious faculty had come to her just as her beauty and\r\ndistinction (to Olive she was full of that quality) had come; it had\r\ndropped straight from heaven, without filtering through her parents,\r\nwhom Miss Chancellor decidedly did not fancy. Even among reformers she\r\ndiscriminated; she thought all wise people wanted great changes, but the\r\nvotaries of change were not necessarily wise. She remained silent a\r\nlittle, after her last remark, and then she repeated again, as if it\r\nwere the solution of everything, as if it represented with absolute\r\ncertainty some immense happiness in the future--"We must wait, we must\r\nwait!" Verena was perfectly willing to wait, though she did not exactly\r\nknow what they were to wait for, and the aspiring frankness of her\r\nassent shone out of her face, and seemed to pacify their mutual gaze.\r\nOlive asked her innumerable questions; she wanted to enter into her\r\nlife. It was one of those talks which people remember afterwards, in\r\nwhich every word has been given and taken, and in which they see the\r\nsigns of a beginning that was to be justified. The more Olive learnt of\r\nher visitor\'s life the more she wanted to enter into it, the more it\r\ntook her out of herself. Such strange lives are led in America, she\r\nalways knew that; but this was queerer than anything she had dreamed of,\r\nand the queerest part was that the girl herself didn\'t appear to think\r\nit queer. She had been nursed in darkened rooms, and suckled in the\r\nmidst of manifestations; she had begun to "attend lectures," as she\r\nsaid, when she was quite an infant, because her mother had no one to\r\nleave her with at home. She had sat on the knees of somnambulists, and\r\nhad been passed from hand to hand by trance-speakers; she was familiar\r\nwith every kind of "cure," and had grown up among lady-editors of\r\nnewspapers advocating new religions, and people who disapproved of the\r\nmarriage-tie. Verena talked of the marriage-tie as she would have talked\r\nof the last novel--as if she had heard it as frequently discussed; and\r\nat certain times, listening to the answers she made to her questions,\r\nOlive Chancellor closed her eyes in the manner of a person waiting till\r\ngiddiness passed. Her young friend\'s revelations actually gave her a\r\nvertigo; they made her perceive everything from which she should have\r\nrescued her. Verena was perfectly uncontaminated, and she would never be\r\ntouched by evil; but though Olive had no views about the marriage-tie\r\nexcept that she should hate it for herself--that particular reform she\r\ndid not propose to consider--she didn\'t like the "atmosphere" of circles\r\nin which such institutions were called into question. She had no wish\r\nnow to enter into an examination of that particular one; nevertheless,\r\nto make sure, she would just ask Verena whether she disapproved of it.\r\n\r\n"Well, I must say," said Miss Tarrant, "I prefer free unions."\r\n\r\nOlive held her breath an instant; such an idea was so disagreeable to\r\nher. Then, for all answer, she murmured, irresolutely, "I wish you would\r\nlet me help you!" Yet it seemed, at the same time, that Verena needed\r\nlittle help, for it was more and more clear that her eloquence, when she\r\nstood up that way before a roomful of people, was literally inspiration.\r\nShe answered all her friend\'s questions with a good-nature which\r\nevidently took no pains to make things plausible, an effort to oblige,\r\nnot to please; but, after all, she could give very little account of\r\nherself. This was very visible when Olive asked her where she had got\r\nher "intense realisation" of the suffering of women; for her address at\r\nMiss Birdseye\'s showed that she, too (like Olive herself), had had that\r\nvision in the watches of the night. Verena thought a moment, as if to\r\nunderstand what her companion referred to, and then she inquired, always\r\nsmiling, where Joan of Arc had got her idea of the suffering of France.\r\nThis was so prettily said that Olive could scarcely keep from kissing\r\nher; she looked at the moment as if, like Joan, she might have had\r\nvisits from the saints. Olive, of course, remembered afterwards that it\r\nhad not literally answered the question; and she also reflected on\r\nsomething that made an answer seem more difficult--the fact that the\r\ngirl had grown up among lady-doctors, lady-mediums, lady-editors,\r\nlady-preachers, lady-healers, women who, having rescued themselves from\r\na passive existence, could illustrate only partially the misery of the\r\nsex at large. It was true that they might have illustrated it by their\r\ntalk, by all they had "been through" and all they could tell a younger\r\nsister; but Olive was sure that Verena\'s prophetic impulse had not been\r\nstirred by the chatter of women (Miss Chancellor knew that sound as well\r\nas any one); it had proceeded rather out of their silence. She said to\r\nher visitor that whether or no the angels came down to her in glittering\r\narmour, she struck her as the only person she had yet encountered who\r\nhad exactly the same tenderness, the same pity, for women that she\r\nherself had. Miss Birdseye had something of it, but Miss Birdseye wanted\r\npassion, wanted keenness, was capable of the weakest concessions. Mrs.\r\nFarrinder was not weak, of course, and she brought a great intellect to\r\nthe matter; but she was not personal enough--she was too abstract.\r\nVerena was not abstract; she seemed to have lived in imagination through\r\nall the ages. Verena said she _did_ think she had a certain amount of\r\nimagination; she supposed she couldn\'t be so effective on the platform\r\nif she hadn\'t a rich fancy. Then Olive said to her, taking her hand\r\nagain, that she wanted her to assure her of this--that it was the only\r\nthing in all the world she cared for, the redemption of women, the thing\r\nshe hoped under Providence to give her life to. Verena flushed a little\r\nat this appeal, and the deeper glow of her eyes was the first sign of\r\nexaltation she had offered. "Oh yes--I want to give my life!" she\r\nexclaimed, with a vibrating voice; and then she added gravely, "I want\r\nto do something great!"\r\n\r\n"You will, you will, we both will!" Olive Chancellor cried, in rapture.\r\nBut after a little she went on: "I wonder if you know what it means,\r\nyoung and lovely as you are--giving your life!"\r\n\r\nVerena looked down for a moment in meditation.\r\n\r\n"Well," she replied, "I guess I have thought more than I appear."\r\n\r\n"Do you understand German? Do you know \'Faust\'?" said Olive. "\'_Entsagen\r\nsollst du, sollst entsagen!_\'"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know German; I should like so to study it; I want to know\r\neverything."\r\n\r\n"We will work at it together--we will study everything." Olive almost\r\npanted; and while she spoke the peaceful picture hung before her of\r\nstill winter evenings under the lamp, with falling snow outside, and tea\r\non a little table, and successful renderings, with a chosen companion,\r\nof Goethe, almost the only foreign author she cared about; for she hated\r\nthe writing of the French, in spite of the importance they have given to\r\nwomen. Such a vision as this was the highest indulgence she could offer\r\nherself; she had it only at considerable intervals. It seemed as if\r\nVerena caught a glimpse of it too, for her face kindled still more, and\r\nshe said she should like that ever so much. At the same time she asked\r\nthe meaning of the German words.\r\n\r\n"\'Thou shalt renounce, refrain, abstain!\' That\'s the way Bayard Taylor\r\nhas translated them," Olive answered.\r\n\r\n"Oh, well, I guess I can abstain!" Verena exclaimed, with a laugh. And\r\nshe got up rather quickly, as if by taking leave she might give a proof\r\nof what she meant. Olive put out her hands to hold her, and at this\r\nmoment one of the _porti\xe8res_ of the room was pushed aside, while a\r\ngentleman was ushered in by Miss Chancellor\'s little parlour-maid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\n\r\nVerena recognised him; she had seen him the night before at Miss\r\nBirdseye\'s, and she said to her hostess, "Now I must go--you have got\r\nanother caller!" It was Verena\'s belief that in the fashionable world\r\n(like Mrs. Farrinder, she thought Miss Chancellor belonged to\r\nit--thought that, in standing there, she herself was in it)--in the\r\nhighest social walks it was the custom of a prior guest to depart when\r\nanother friend arrived. She had been told at people\'s doors that she\r\ncould not be received because the lady of the house had a visitor, and\r\nshe had retired on these occasions with a feeling of awe much more than\r\na sense of injury. They had not been the portals of fashion, but in this\r\nrespect, she deemed, they had emulated such bulwarks. Olive Chancellor\r\noffered Basil Ransom a greeting which she believed to be consummately\r\nlady-like, and which the young man, narrating the scene several months\r\nlater to Mrs. Luna, whose susceptibilities he did not feel himself\r\nobliged to consider (she considered his so little), described by saying\r\nthat she glared at him. Olive had thought it very possible he would come\r\nthat day if he was to leave Boston; though she was perfectly mindful\r\nthat she had given him no encouragement at the moment they separated. If\r\nhe should not come she should be annoyed, and if he should come she\r\nshould be furious; she was also sufficiently mindful of that. But she\r\nhad a foreboding that, of the two grievances, fortune would confer upon\r\nher only the less; the only one she had as yet was that he had responded\r\nto her letter--a complaint rather wanting in richness. If he came, at\r\nany rate, he would be likely to come shortly before dinner, at the same\r\nhour as yesterday. He had now anticipated this period considerably, and\r\nit seemed to Miss Chancellor that he had taken a base advantage of her,\r\nstolen a march upon her privacy. She was startled, disconcerted, but as\r\nI have said, she was rigorously lady-like. She was determined not again\r\nto be fantastic, as she had been about his coming to Miss Birdseye\'s.\r\nThe strange dread associating itself with that was something which, she\r\ndevoutly trusted, she had felt once for all. She didn\'t know what he\r\ncould do to her; he hadn\'t prevented, on the spot though he was, one of\r\nthe happiest things that had befallen her for so long--this quick,\r\nconfident visit of Verena Tarrant. It was only just at the last that he\r\nhad come in, and Verena must go now; Olive\'s detaining hand immediately\r\nrelaxed itself.\r\n\r\nIt is to be feared there was no disguise of Ransom\'s satisfaction at\r\nfinding himself once more face to face with the charming creature with\r\nwhom he had exchanged that final speechless smile the evening before. He\r\nwas more glad to see her than if she had been an old friend, for it\r\nseemed to him that she had suddenly become a new one. "The delightful\r\ngirl," he said to himself; "she smiles at me as if she liked me!" He\r\ncould not know that this was fatuous, that she smiled so at every one;\r\nthe first time she saw people she treated them as if she recognised\r\nthem. Moreover, she did not seat herself again in his honour; she let it\r\nbe seen that she was still going. The three stood there together in the\r\nmiddle of the long, characteristic room, and, for the first time in her\r\nlife, Olive Chancellor chose not to introduce two persons who met under\r\nher roof. She hated Europe, but she could be European if it were\r\nnecessary. Neither of her companions had an idea that in leaving them\r\nsimply planted face to face (the terror of the American heart) she had\r\nso high a warrant; and presently Basil Ransom felt that he didn\'t care\r\nwhether he were introduced or not, for the greatness of an evil didn\'t\r\nmatter if the remedy were equally great.\r\n\r\n"Miss Tarrant won\'t be surprised if I recognise her--if I take the\r\nliberty to speak to her. She is a public character; she must pay the\r\npenalty of her distinction." These words he boldly addressed to the\r\ngirl, with his most gallant Southern manner, saying to himself meanwhile\r\nthat she was prettier still by daylight.\r\n\r\n"Oh, a great many gentlemen have spoken to me," Verena said. "There were\r\nquite a number at Topeka----" And her phrase lost itself in her look at\r\nOlive, as if she were wondering what was the matter with her.\r\n\r\n"Now, I am afraid you are going the very moment I appear," Ransom went\r\non. "Do you know that\'s very cruel to me? I know what your ideas\r\nare--you expressed them last night in such beautiful language; of course\r\nyou convinced me. I am ashamed of being a man; but I am, and I can\'t\r\nhelp it, and I\'ll do penance any way you may prescribe. _Must_ she go,\r\nMiss Olive?" he asked of his cousin. "Do you flee before the individual\r\nmale?" And he turned to Verena.\r\n\r\nThis young lady gave a laugh that resembled speech in liquid fusion. "Oh\r\nno; I like the individual!"\r\n\r\nAs an incarnation of a "movement," Ransom thought her more and more\r\nsingular, and he wondered how she came to be closeted so soon with his\r\nkinswoman, to whom, only a few hours before, she had been a complete\r\nstranger. These, however, were doubtless the normal proceedings of\r\nwomen. He begged her to sit down again; he was sure Miss Chancellor\r\nwould be sorry to part with her. Verena, looking at her friend, not for\r\npermission, but for sympathy, dropped again into a chair, and Ransom\r\nwaited to see Miss Chancellor do the same. She gratified him after a\r\nmoment, because she could not refuse without appearing to put a hurt\r\nupon Verena; but it went hard with her, and she was altogether\r\ndiscomposed. She had never seen any one so free in her own drawing-room\r\nas this loud Southerner, to whom she had so rashly offered a footing; he\r\nextended invitations to her guests under her nose. That Verena should do\r\nas he asked her was a signal sign of the absence of that "home-culture"\r\n(it was so that Miss Chancellor expressed the missing quality) which she\r\nnever supposed the girl possessed: fortunately, as it would be supplied\r\nto her in abundance in Charles Street. (Olive of course held that\r\nhome-culture was perfectly compatible with the widest emancipation.) It\r\nwas with a perfectly good conscience that Verena complied with Basil\r\nRansom\'s request; but it took her quick sensibility only a moment to\r\ndiscover that her friend was not pleased. She scarcely knew what had\r\nruffled her, but at the same instant there passed before her the vision\r\nof the anxieties (of this sudden, unexplained sort, for instance, and\r\nmuch worse) which intimate relations with Miss Chancellor might entail.\r\n\r\n"Now, I want you to tell me this," Basil Ransom said, leaning forward\r\ntowards Verena, with his hands on his knees, and completely oblivious to\r\nhis hostess. "Do you really believe all that pretty moonshine you talked\r\nlast night? I could have listened to you for another hour; but I never\r\nheard such monstrous sentiments, I must protest--I must, as a\r\ncalumniated, misrepresented man. Confess you meant it as a kind of\r\n_reductio ad absurdum_--a satire on Mrs. Farrinder?" He spoke in a tone\r\nof the freest pleasantry, with his familiar, friendly Southern cadence.\r\n\r\nVerena looked at him with eyes that grew large. "Why, you don\'t mean to\r\nsay you don\'t believe in our cause?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, it won\'t do--it won\'t do!" Ransom went on, laughing. "You are on\r\nthe wrong tack altogether. Do you really take the ground that your sex\r\nhas been without influence? Influence? Why, you have led us all by the\r\nnose to where we are now! Wherever we are, it\'s all you. You are at the\r\nbottom of everything."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, and we want to be at the top," said Verena.\r\n\r\n"Ah, the bottom is a better place, depend on it, when from there you\r\nmove the whole mass! Besides, you are on the top as well; you are\r\neverywhere, you are everything. I am of the opinion of that historical\r\ncharacter--wasn\'t he some king?--who thought there was a lady behind\r\neverything. Whatever it was, he held, you have only to look for her; she\r\nis the explanation. Well, I always look for her, and I always find her;\r\nof course, I am always delighted to do so; but it proves she is the\r\nuniversal cause. Now, you don\'t mean to deny that power, the power of\r\nsetting men in motion. You are at the bottom of all the wars."\r\n\r\n"Well, I am like Mrs. Farrinder; I like opposition," Verena exclaimed,\r\nwith a happy smile.\r\n\r\n"That proves, as I say, how in spite of your expressions of horror you\r\ndelight in the shock of battle. What do you say to Helen of Troy and the\r\nfearful carnage she excited? It is well known that the Empress of France\r\nwas at the bottom of the last war in that country. And as for our four\r\nfearful years of slaughter, of course, you won\'t deny that there the\r\nladies were the great motive power. The Abolitionists brought it on, and\r\nwere not the Abolitionists principally females? Who was that celebrity\r\nthat was mentioned last night?--Eliza P. Moseley. I regard Eliza as the\r\ncause of the biggest war of which history preserves the record."\r\n\r\nBasil Ransom enjoyed his humour the more because Verena appeared to\r\nenjoy it; and the look with which she replied to him, at the end of this\r\nlittle tirade, "Why, sir, you ought to take the platform too; we might\r\ngo round together as poison and antidote!"--this made him feel that he\r\nhad convinced her, for the moment, quite as much as it was important he\r\nshould. In Verena\'s face, however, it lasted but an instant--an instant\r\nafter she had glanced at Olive Chancellor, who, with her eyes fixed\r\nintently on the ground (a look she was to learn to know so well), had a\r\nstrange expression. The girl slowly got up; she felt that she must go.\r\nShe guessed Miss Chancellor didn\'t like this handsome joker (it was so\r\nthat Basil Ransom struck her); and it was impressed upon her ("in time,"\r\nas she thought) that her new friend would be more serious even than she\r\nabout the woman-question, serious as she had hitherto believed herself\r\nto be.\r\n\r\n"I should like so much to have the pleasure of seeing you again," Ransom\r\ncontinued. "I think I should be able to interpret history for you by a\r\nnew light."\r\n\r\n"Well, I should be very happy to see you in my home." These words had\r\nbarely fallen from Verena\'s lips (her mother told her they were, in\r\ngeneral, the proper thing to say when people expressed such a desire as\r\nthat; she must not let it be assumed that she would come first to\r\nthem)--she had hardly uttered this hospitable speech when she felt the\r\nhand of her hostess upon her arm and became aware that a passionate\r\nappeal sat in Olive\'s eyes.\r\n\r\n"You will just catch the Charles Street car," that young woman murmured,\r\nwith muffled sweetness.\r\n\r\nVerena did not understand further than to see that she ought already to\r\nhave departed; and the simplest response was to kiss Miss Chancellor, an\r\nact which she briefly performed. Basil Ransom understood still less, and\r\nit was a melancholy commentary on his contention that men are not\r\ninferior, that this meeting could not come, however rapidly, to a close\r\nwithout his plunging into a blunder which necessarily aggravated those\r\nhe had already made. He had been invited by the little prophetess, and\r\nyet he had not been invited; but he did not take that up, because he\r\nmust absolutely leave Boston on the morrow, and, besides, Miss\r\nChancellor appeared to have something to say to it. But he put out his\r\nhand to Verena and said, "Good-bye, Miss Tarrant; are we not to have the\r\npleasure of hearing you in New York? I am afraid we are sadly sunk."\r\n\r\n"Certainly, I should like to raise my voice in the biggest city," the\r\ngirl replied.\r\n\r\n"Well, try to come on. I won\'t refute you. It would be a very stupid\r\nworld, after all, if we always knew what women were going to say."\r\n\r\nVerena was conscious of the approach of the Charles Street car, as well\r\nas of the fact that Miss Chancellor was in pain; but she lingered long\r\nenough to remark that she could see he had the old-fashioned ideas--he\r\nregarded woman as the toy of man.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t say the toy--say the joy!" Ransom exclaimed. "There is one\r\nstatement I will venture to advance; I am quite as fond of you as you\r\nare of each other!"\r\n\r\n"Much he knows about that!" said Verena, with a side-long smile at Olive\r\nChancellor.\r\n\r\nFor Olive, it made her more beautiful than ever; still, there was no\r\ntrace of this mere personal elation in the splendid sententiousness with\r\nwhich, turning to Mr. Ransom, she remarked: "What women may be, or may\r\nnot be, to each other, I won\'t attempt just now to say; but what _the\r\ntruth_ may be to a human soul, I think perhaps even a woman may faintly\r\nsuspect!"\r\n\r\n"The truth? My dear cousin, your truth is a most vain thing!"\r\n\r\n"Gracious me!" cried Verena Tarrant; and the gay vibration of her voice\r\nas she uttered this simple ejaculation was the last that Ransom heard of\r\nher. Miss Chancellor swept her out of the room, leaving the young man to\r\nextract a relish from the ineffable irony with which she uttered the\r\nwords "even a woman." It was to be supposed, on general grounds, that\r\nshe would reappear, but there was nothing in the glance she gave him, as\r\nshe turned her back, that was an earnest of this. He stood there a\r\nmoment, wondering; then his wonder spent itself on the page of a book\r\nwhich, according to his habit at such times, he had mechanically taken\r\nup, and in which he speedily became interested. He read it for five\r\nminutes in an uncomfortable-looking attitude, and quite forgot that he\r\nhad been forsaken. He was recalled to this fact by the entrance of Mrs.\r\nLuna, arrayed as if for the street, and putting on her gloves again--she\r\nseemed always to be putting on her gloves. She wanted to know what in\r\nthe world he was doing there alone--whether her sister had not been\r\nnotified.\r\n\r\n"Oh yes," said Ransom, "she has just been with me, but she has gone\r\ndownstairs with Miss Tarrant."\r\n\r\n"And who in the world is Miss Tarrant?"\r\n\r\nRansom was surprised that Mrs. Luna should not know of the intimacy of\r\nthe two young ladies, in spite of the brevity of their acquaintance,\r\nbeing already so great. But, apparently, Miss Olive had not mentioned\r\nher new friend. "Well, she is an inspirational speaker--the most\r\ncharming creature in the world!"\r\n\r\nMrs. Luna paused in her manipulations, gave an amazed, amused stare,\r\nthen caused the room to ring with her laughter. "You don\'t mean to say\r\nyou are converted--already?"\r\n\r\n"Converted to Miss Tarrant, decidedly."\r\n\r\n"You are not to belong to any Miss Tarrant; you are to belong to me,"\r\nMrs. Luna said, having thought over her Southern kinsman during the\r\ntwenty-four hours, and made up her mind that he would be a good man for\r\na lone woman to know. Then she added: "Did you come here to meet\r\nher--the inspirational speaker?"\r\n\r\n"No; I came to bid your sister good-bye."\r\n\r\n"Are you really going? I haven\'t made you promise half the things I want\r\nyet. But we will settle that in New York. How do you get on with Olive\r\nChancellor?" Mrs. Luna continued, making her points, as she always did,\r\nwith eagerness, though her roundness and her dimples had hitherto\r\nprevented her from being accused of that vice. It was her practice to\r\nspeak of her sister by her whole name, and you would have supposed, from\r\nher usual manner of alluding to her, that Olive was much the older,\r\ninstead of having been born ten years later than Adeline. She had as\r\nmany ways as possible of marking the gulf that divided them; but she\r\nbridged it over lightly now by saying to Basil Ransom; "Isn\'t she a dear\r\nold thing?"\r\n\r\nThis bridge, he saw, would not bear his weight, and her question seemed\r\nto him to have more audacity than sense. Why should she be so insincere?\r\nShe might know that a man couldn\'t recognise Miss Chancellor in such a\r\ndescription as that. She was not old--she was sharply young; and it was\r\ninconceivable to him, though he had just seen the little prophetess kiss\r\nher, that she should ever become any one\'s "dear." Least of all was she\r\na "thing"; she was intensely, fearfully, a person. He hesitated a\r\nmoment, and then he replied: "She\'s a very remarkable woman."\r\n\r\n"Take care--don\'t be reckless!" cried Mrs. Luna. "Do you think she is\r\nvery dreadful?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t say anything against my cousin," Basil answered; and at that\r\nmoment Miss Chancellor re-entered the room. She murmured some request\r\nthat he would excuse her absence, but her sister interrupted her with an\r\ninquiry about Miss Tarrant.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Ransom thinks her wonderfully charming. Why didn\'t you show her to\r\nme? Do you want to keep her all to yourself?"\r\n\r\nOlive rested her eyes for some moments upon Mrs. Luna, without speaking.\r\nThen she said: "Your veil is not put on straight, Adeline."\r\n\r\n"I look like a monster--that, evidently, is what you mean!" Adeline\r\nexclaimed, going to the mirror to rearrange the peccant tissue.\r\n\r\nMiss Chancellor did not again ask Ransom to be seated; she appeared to\r\ntake it for granted that he would leave her now. But instead of this he\r\nreturned to the subject of Verena; he asked her whether she supposed the\r\ngirl would come out in public--would go about like Mrs. Farrinder?\r\n\r\n"Come out in public!" Olive repeated; "in public? Why, you don\'t imagine\r\nthat pure voice is to be hushed?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, hushed, no! it\'s too sweet for that. But not raised to a scream;\r\nnot forced and cracked and ruined. She oughtn\'t to become like the\r\nothers. She ought to remain apart."\r\n\r\n"Apart--_apart_?" said Miss Chancellor; "when we shall all be looking to\r\nher, gathering about her, praying for her!" There was an exceeding scorn\r\nin her voice. "If _I_ can help her, she shall be an immense power for\r\ngood."\r\n\r\n"An immense power for quackery, my dear Miss Olive!" This broke from\r\nBasil\'s lips in spite of a vow he had just taken not to say anything\r\nthat should "aggravate" his hostess, who was in a state of tension it\r\nwas not difficult to detect. But he had lowered his tone to friendly\r\npleading, and the offensive word was mitigated by his smile.\r\n\r\nShe moved away from him, backwards, as if he had given her a push. "Ah,\r\nwell, now you are reckless," Mrs. Luna remarked, drawing out her ribbons\r\nbefore the mirror.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think you would interfere if you knew how little you understand\r\nus," Miss Chancellor said to Ransom.\r\n\r\n"Whom do you mean by \'us\'--your whole delightful sex? I don\'t understand\r\n_you_, Miss Olive."\r\n\r\n"Come away with me, and I\'ll explain her as we go," Mrs. Luna went on,\r\nhaving finished her toilet.\r\n\r\nRansom offered his hand in farewell to his hostess; but Olive found it\r\nimpossible to do anything but ignore the gesture. She could not have let\r\nhim touch her. "Well, then, if you must exhibit her to the multitude,\r\nbring her on to New York," he said, with the same attempt at a light\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll have _me_ in New York--you don\'t want any one else!" Mrs. Luna\r\nejaculated, coquettishly. "I have made up my mind to winter there now."\r\n\r\nOlive Chancellor looked from one to the other of her two relatives, one\r\nnear and the other distant, but each so little in sympathy with her, and\r\nit came over her that there might be a kind of protection for her in\r\nbinding them together, entangling them with each other. She had never\r\nhad an idea of that kind in her life before, and that this sudden\r\nsubtlety should have gleamed upon her as a momentary talisman gives the\r\nmeasure of her present nervousness.\r\n\r\n"If I could take her to New York, I would take her farther," she\r\nremarked, hoping she was enigmatical.\r\n\r\n"You talk about \'taking\' her, as if you were a lecture-agent. Are you\r\ngoing into that business?" Mrs. Luna asked.\r\n\r\nRansom could not help noticing that Miss Chancellor would not shake\r\nhands with him, and he felt, on the whole, rather injured. He paused a\r\nmoment before leaving the room--standing there with his hand on the knob\r\nof the door. "Look here, Miss Olive, what did you write to me to come\r\nand see you for?" He made this inquiry with a countenance not destitute\r\nof gaiety, but his eyes showed something of that yellow light--just\r\nmomentarily lurid--of which mention has been made. Mrs. Luna was on her\r\nway downstairs, and her companions remained face to face.\r\n\r\n"Ask my sister--I think she will tell you," said Olive, turning away\r\nfrom him and going to the window. She remained there, looking out; she\r\nheard the door of the house close, and saw the two cross the street\r\ntogether. As they passed out of sight her fingers played, softly, a\r\nlittle air upon the pane; it seemed to her that she had had an\r\ninspiration.\r\n\r\nBasil Ransom, meanwhile, put the question to Mrs. Luna. "If she was not\r\ngoing to like me, why in the world did she write to me?"\r\n\r\n"Because she wanted you to know me--she thought _I_ would like you!" And\r\napparently she had not been wrong; for Mrs. Luna, when they reached\r\nBeacon Street, would not hear of his leaving her to go her way alone,\r\nwould not in the least admit his plea that he had only an hour or two\r\nmore in Boston (he was to travel, economically, by the boat) and must\r\ndevote the time to his business. She appealed to his Southern chivalry,\r\nand not in vain; practically, at least, he admitted the rights of women.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Tarrant was delighted, as may be imagined, with her daughter\'s\r\naccount of Miss Chancellor\'s interior, and the reception the girl had\r\nfound there; and Verena, for the next month, took her way very often to\r\nCharles Street. "Just you be as nice to her as you know how," Mrs.\r\nTarrant had said to her; and she reflected with some complacency that\r\nher daughter did know--she knew how to do everything of that sort. It\r\nwas not that Verena had been taught; that branch of the education of\r\nyoung ladies which is known as "manners and deportment" had not figured,\r\nas a definite head, in Miss Tarrant\'s curriculum. She had been told,\r\nindeed, that she must not lie nor steal; but she had been told very\r\nlittle else about behaviour; her only great advantage, in short, had\r\nbeen the parental example. But her mother liked to think that she was\r\nquick and graceful, and she questioned her exhaustively as to the\r\nprogress of this interesting episode; she didn\'t see why, as she said,\r\nit shouldn\'t be a permanent "stand-by" for Verena. In Mrs. Tarrant\'s\r\nmeditations upon the girl\'s future she had never thought of a fine\r\nmarriage as a reward of effort; she would have deemed herself very\r\nimmoral if she had endeavoured to capture for her child a rich husband.\r\nShe had not, in fact, a very vivid sense of the existence of such agents\r\nof fate; all the rich men she had seen already had wives, and the\r\nunmarried men, who were generally very young, were distinguished from\r\neach other not so much by the figure of their income, which came little\r\ninto question, as by the degree of their interest in regenerating ideas.\r\nShe supposed Verena would marry some one, some day, and she hoped the\r\npersonage would be connected with public life--which meant, for Mrs.\r\nTarrant, that his name would be visible, in the lamp-light, on a\r\ncoloured poster, in the doorway of Tremont Temple. But she was not eager\r\nabout this vision, for the implications of matrimony were for the most\r\npart wanting in brightness--consisted of a tired woman holding a baby\r\nover a furnace-register that emitted lukewarm air. A real lovely\r\nfriendship with a young woman who had, as Mrs. Tarrant expressed it,\r\n"prop\'ty," would occupy agreeably such an interval as might occur before\r\nVerena should meet her sterner fate; it would be a great thing for her\r\nto have a place to run into when she wanted a change, and there was no\r\nknowing but what it might end in her having two homes. For the idea of\r\nthe home, like most American women of her quality, Mrs. Tarrant had an\r\nextreme reverence; and it was her candid faith that in all the\r\nvicissitudes of the past twenty years she had preserved the spirit of\r\nthis institution. If it should exist in duplicate for Verena, the girl\r\nwould be favoured indeed.\r\n\r\nAll this was as nothing, however, compared with the fact that Miss\r\nChancellor seemed to think her young friend\'s gift _was_ inspirational,\r\nor at any rate, as Selah had so often said, quite unique. She couldn\'t\r\nmake out very exactly, by Verena, what she thought; but if the way Miss\r\nChancellor had taken hold of her didn\'t show that she believed she could\r\nrouse the people, Mrs. Tarrant didn\'t know what it showed. It was a\r\nsatisfaction to her that Verena evidently responded freely; she didn\'t\r\nthink anything of what she spent in car-tickets, and indeed she had told\r\nher that Miss Chancellor wanted to stuff her pockets with them. At first\r\nshe went in because her mother liked to have her; but now, evidently,\r\nshe went because she was so much drawn. She expressed the highest\r\nadmiration of her new friend; she said it took her a little while to see\r\ninto her, but now that she did, well, she was perfectly splendid. When\r\nVerena wanted to admire she went ahead of every one, and it was\r\ndelightful to see how she was stimulated by the young lady in Charles\r\nStreet. They thought everything of each other--that was very plain; you\r\ncould scarcely tell which thought most. Each thought the other so noble,\r\nand Mrs. Tarrant had a faith that between them they _would_ rouse the\r\npeople. What Verena wanted was some one who would know how to handle her\r\n(her father hadn\'t handled anything except the healing, up to this time,\r\nwith real success), and perhaps Miss Chancellor would take hold better\r\nthan some that made more of a profession.\r\n\r\n"It\'s beautiful, the way she draws you out," Verena had said to her\r\nmother; "there\'s something so searching that the first time I visited\r\nher it quite realised my idea of the Day of Judgement. But she seems to\r\nshow all that\'s in herself at the same time, and then you see how lovely\r\nit is. She\'s just as pure as she can live; you see if she is not, when\r\nyou know her. She\'s so noble herself that she makes you feel as if you\r\nwouldn\'t want to be less so. She doesn\'t care for anything but the\r\nelevation of our sex; if she can work a little toward that, it\'s all she\r\nasks. I can tell you, she kindles me; she does, mother, really. She\r\ndoesn\'t care a speck what she wears--only to have an elegant parlour.\r\nWell, she _has_ got that; it\'s a regular dream-like place to sit. She\'s\r\ngoing to have a tree in, next week; she says she wants to see me sitting\r\nunder a tree. I believe it\'s some oriental idea; it has lately been\r\nintroduced in Paris. She doesn\'t like French ideas as a general thing;\r\nbut she says this has more nature than most. She has got so many of her\r\nown that I shouldn\'t think she would require to borrow any. I\'d sit in a\r\nforest to hear her bring some of them out," Verena went on, with\r\ncharacteristic raciness. "She just quivers when she describes what our\r\nsex has been through. It\'s so interesting to me to hear what I have\r\nalways felt. If she wasn\'t afraid of facing the public, she would go far\r\nahead of me. But she doesn\'t want to speak herself; she only wants to\r\ncall me out. Mother, if she doesn\'t attract attention to me there isn\'t\r\nany attention to be attracted. She says I have got the gift of\r\nexpression--it doesn\'t matter where it comes from. She says it\'s a great\r\nadvantage to a movement to be personified in a bright young figure.\r\nWell, of course I\'m young, and I feel bright enough when once I get\r\nstarted. She says my serenity while exposed to the gaze of hundreds is\r\nin itself a qualification; in fact, she seems to think my serenity is\r\nquite God-given. She hasn\'t got much of it herself; she\'s the most\r\nemotional woman I have met, up to now. She wants to know how I can speak\r\nthe way I do unless I feel; and of course I tell her I do feel, so far\r\nas I realise. She seems to be realising all the time; I never saw any\r\none that took so little rest. She says I ought to do something great,\r\nand she makes me feel as if I should. She says I ought to have a wide\r\ninfluence, if I can obtain the ear of the public; and I say to her that\r\nif I do it will be all her influence."\r\n\r\nSelah Tarrant looked at all this from a higher standpoint than his wife;\r\nat least such an attitude on his part was to be inferred from his\r\nincreased solemnity. He committed himself to no precipitate elation at\r\nthe idea of his daughter\'s being taken up by a patroness of movements\r\nwho happened to have money; he looked at his child only from the point\r\nof view of the service she might render to humanity. To keep her ideal\r\npointing in the right direction, to guide and animate her moral\r\nlife--this was a duty more imperative for a parent so closely identified\r\nwith revelations and panaceas than seeing that she formed profitable\r\nworldly connexions. He was "off," moreover, so much of the time that he\r\ncould keep little account of her comings and goings, and he had an air\r\nof being but vaguely aware of whom Miss Chancellor, the object now of\r\nhis wife\'s perpetual reference, might be. Verena\'s initial appearance in\r\nBoston, as he called her performance at Miss Birdseye\'s, had been a\r\ngreat success; and this reflexion added, as I say, to his habitually\r\nsacerdotal expression. He looked like the priest of a religion that was\r\npassing through the stage of miracles; he carried his responsibility in\r\nthe general elongation of his person, of his gestures (his hands were\r\nnow always in the air, as if he were being photographed in postures), of\r\nhis words and sentences, as well as in his smile, as noiseless as a\r\npatent hinge, and in the folds of his eternal waterproof. He was\r\nincapable of giving an off-hand answer or opinion on the simplest\r\noccasion, and his tone of high deliberation increased in proportion as\r\nthe subject was trivial or domestic. If his wife asked him at dinner if\r\nthe potatoes were good, he replied that they were strikingly fine (he\r\nused to speak of the newspaper as "fine"--he applied this term to\r\nobjects the most dissimilar), and embarked on a parallel worthy of\r\nPlutarch, in which he compared them with other specimens of the same\r\nvegetable. He produced, or would have liked to produce, the impression\r\nof looking above and beyond everything, of not caring for the immediate,\r\nof reckoning only with the long run. In reality he had one all-absorbing\r\nsolicitude--the desire to get paragraphs put into the newspapers,\r\nparagraphs of which he had hitherto been the subject, but of which he\r\nwas now to divide the glory with his daughter. The newspapers were his\r\nworld, the richest expression, in his eyes, of human life; and, for him,\r\nif a diviner day was to come upon earth, it would be brought about by\r\ncopious advertisement in the daily prints. He looked with longing for\r\nthe moment when Verena should be advertised among the "personals," and\r\nto his mind the supremely happy people were those (and there were a good\r\nmany of them) of whom there was some journalistic mention every day in\r\nthe year. Nothing less than this would really have satisfied Selah\r\nTarrant; his ideal of bliss was to be as regularly and indispensably a\r\ncomponent part of the newspaper as the title and date, or the list of\r\nfires, or the column of Western jokes. The vision of that publicity\r\nhaunted his dreams, and he would gladly have sacrificed to it the\r\ninnermost sanctities of home. Human existence to him, indeed, was a huge\r\npublicity, in which the only fault was that it was sometimes not\r\nsufficiently effective. There had been a Spiritualist paper of old which\r\nhe used to pervade; but he could not persuade himself that through this\r\nmedium his personality had attracted general attention; and, moreover,\r\nthe sheet, as he said, was played out anyway. Success was not success so\r\nlong as his daughter\'s _physique_, the rumour of her engagement, were\r\nnot included in the "Jottings" with the certainty of being extensively\r\ncopied.\r\n\r\nThe account of her exploits in the West had not made their way to the\r\nseaboard with the promptitude that he had looked for; the reason of this\r\nbeing, he supposed, that the few addresses she had made had not been\r\nlectures, announced in advance, to which tickets had been sold, but\r\nincidents, of abrupt occurrence, of certain multitudinous meetings,\r\nwhere there had been other performers better known to fame. They had\r\nbrought in no money; they had been delivered only for the good of the\r\ncause. If it could only be known that she spoke for nothing, that might\r\ndeepen the reverberation; the only trouble was that her speaking for\r\nnothing was not the way to remind him that he had a remunerative\r\ndaughter. It was not the way to stand out so very much either, Selah\r\nTarrant felt; for there were plenty of others that knew how to make as\r\nlittle money as she would. To speak--that was the one thing that most\r\npeople were willing to do for nothing; it was not a line in which it was\r\neasy to appear conspicuously disinterested. Disinterestedness, too, was\r\nincompatible with receipts; and receipts were what Selah Tarrant was, in\r\nhis own parlance, after. He wished to bring about the day when they\r\nwould flow in freely; the reader perhaps sees the gesture with which, in\r\nhis colloquies with himself, he accompanied this mental image.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to him at present that the fruitful time was not far off; it\r\nhad been brought appreciably nearer by that fortunate evening at Miss\r\nBirdseye\'s. If Mrs. Farrinder could be induced to write an "open letter"\r\nabout Verena, that would do more than anything else. Selah was not\r\nremarkable for delicacy of perception, but he knew the world he lived in\r\nwell enough to be aware that Mrs. Farrinder was liable to rear up, as\r\nthey used to say down in Pennsylvania, where he lived before he began to\r\npeddle lead-pencils. She wouldn\'t always take things as you might\r\nexpect, and if it didn\'t meet her views to pay a public tribute to\r\nVerena, there wasn\'t any way known to Tarrant\'s ingenious mind of\r\ngetting round her. If it was a question of a favour from Mrs. Farrinder,\r\nyou just had to wait for it, as you would for a rise in the thermometer.\r\nHe had told Miss Birdseye what he would like, and she seemed to think,\r\nfrom the way their celebrated friend had been affected, that the idea\r\nmight take her some day of just letting the public know all she had\r\nfelt. She was off somewhere now (since that evening), but Miss Birdseye\r\nhad an idea that when she was back in Roxbury she would send for Verena\r\nand give her a few points. Meanwhile, at any rate, Selah was sure he had\r\na card; he felt there was money in the air. It might already be said\r\nthere were receipts from Charles Street; that rich, peculiar young woman\r\nseemed to want to lavish herself. He pretended, as I have intimated, not\r\nto notice this; but he never saw so much as when he had his eyes fixed\r\non the cornice. He had no doubt that if he should make up his mind to\r\ntake a hall some night, she would tell him where the bill might be sent.\r\nThat was what he was thinking of now, whether he had better take a hall\r\nright away, so that Verena might leap at a bound into renown, or wait\r\ntill she had made a few more appearances in private, so that curiosity\r\nmight be worked up.\r\n\r\nThese meditations accompanied him in his multifarious wanderings through\r\nthe streets and the suburbs of the New England capital. As I have also\r\nmentioned, he was absent for hours--long periods during which Mrs.\r\nTarrant, sustaining nature with a hard-boiled egg and a doughnut,\r\nwondered how in the world he stayed his stomach. He never wanted\r\nanything but a piece of pie when he came in; the only thing about which\r\nhe was particular was that it should be served up hot. She had a private\r\nconviction that he partook, at the houses of his lady patients, of\r\nlittle lunches; she applied this term to any episodical repast, at any\r\nhour of the twenty-four. It is but fair to add that once, when she\r\nbetrayed her suspicion, Selah remarked that the only refreshment _he_\r\never wanted was the sense that he was doing some good. This effort with\r\nhim had many forms; it involved, among other things, a perpetual\r\nperambulation of the streets, a haunting of horse-cars,\r\nrailway-stations, shops that were "selling off." But the places that\r\nknew him best were the offices of the newspapers and the vestibules of\r\nthe hotels--the big marble-paved chambers of informal reunion which\r\noffer to the streets, through high glass plates, the sight of the\r\nAmerican citizen suspended by his heels. Here, amid the piled-up\r\nluggage, the convenient spittoons, the elbowing loungers, the\r\ndisconsolate "guests," the truculent Irish porters, the rows of\r\nshaggy-backed men in strange hats, writing letters at a table inlaid\r\nwith advertisements, Selah Tarrant made innumerable contemplative\r\nstations. He could not have told you, at any particular moment, what he\r\nwas doing; he only had a general sense that such places were national\r\nnerve-centres, and that the more one looked in, the more one was "on the\r\nspot." The _penetralia_ of the daily press were, however, still more\r\nfascinating, and the fact that they were less accessible, that here he\r\nfound barriers in his path, only added to the zest of forcing an\r\nentrance. He abounded in pretexts; he even sometimes brought\r\ncontributions; he was persistent and penetrating, he was known as the\r\nirrepressible Tarrant. He hung about, sat too long, took up the time of\r\nbusy people, edged into the printing-rooms when he had been eliminated\r\nfrom the office, talked with the compositors till they set up his\r\nremarks by mistake, and to the newsboys when the compositors had turned\r\ntheir backs. He was always trying to find out what was "going in"; he\r\nwould have liked to go in himself, bodily, and, failing in this, he\r\nhoped to get advertisements inserted gratis. The wish of his soul was\r\nthat he might be interviewed; that made him hover at the editorial\r\nelbow. Once he thought he had been, and the headings, five or six deep,\r\ndanced for days before his eyes; but the report never appeared. He\r\nexpected his revenge for this the day after Verena should have burst\r\nforth; he saw the attitude in which he should receive the emissaries who\r\nwould come after his daughter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\n\r\n"We ought to have some one to meet her," Mrs. Tarrant said; "I presume\r\nshe wouldn\'t care to come out just to see us." "She," between the mother\r\nand the daughter, at this period, could refer only to Olive Chancellor,\r\nwho was discussed in the little house at Cambridge at all hours and from\r\nevery possible point of view. It was never Verena now who began, for she\r\nhad grown rather weary of the topic; she had her own ways of thinking of\r\nit, which were not her mother\'s, and if she lent herself to this lady\'s\r\nextensive considerations it was because that was the best way of keeping\r\nher thoughts to herself.\r\n\r\nMrs. Tarrant had an idea that she (Mrs. Tarrant) liked to study people,\r\nand that she was now engaged in an analysis of Miss Chancellor. It\r\ncarried her far, and she came out at unexpected times with her results.\r\nIt was still her purpose to interpret the world to the ingenious mind of\r\nher daughter, and she translated Miss Chancellor with a confidence which\r\nmade little account of the fact that she had seen her but once, while\r\nVerena had this advantage nearly every day. Verena felt that by this\r\ntime she knew Olive very well, and her mother\'s most complicated\r\nversions of motive and temperament (Mrs. Tarrant, with the most\r\nimperfect idea of the meaning of the term, was always talking about\r\npeople\'s temperament) rendered small justice to the phenomena it was now\r\nher privilege to observe in Charles Street. Olive was much more\r\nremarkable than Mrs. Tarrant suspected, remarkable as Mrs. Tarrant\r\nbelieved her to be. She had opened Verena\'s eyes to extraordinary\r\npictures, made the girl believe that she had a heavenly mission, given\r\nher, as we have seen, quite a new measure of the interest of life. These\r\nwere larger consequences than the possibility of meeting the leaders of\r\nsociety at Olive\'s house. She had met no one, as yet, but Mrs. Luna; her\r\nnew friend seemed to wish to keep her quite for herself. This was the\r\nonly reproach that Mrs. Tarrant directed to the new friend as yet; she\r\nwas disappointed that Verena had not obtained more insight into the\r\nworld of fashion. It was one of the prime articles of her faith that the\r\nworld of fashion was wicked and hollow, and, moreover, Verena told her\r\nthat Miss Chancellor loathed and despised it. She could not have\r\ninformed you wherein it would profit her daughter (for the way those\r\nladies shrank from any new gospel was notorious); nevertheless she was\r\nvexed that Verena shouldn\'t come back to her with a little more of the\r\nfragrance of Beacon Street. The girl herself would have been the most\r\ninterested person in the world if she had not been the most resigned;\r\nshe took all that was given her and was grateful, and missed nothing\r\nthat was withheld; she was the most extraordinary mixture of eagerness\r\nand docility. Mrs. Tarrant theorised about temperaments and she loved\r\nher daughter; but she was only vaguely aware of the fact that she had at\r\nher side the sweetest flower of character (as one might say) that had\r\never bloomed on earth. She was proud of Verena\'s brightness, and of her\r\nspecial talent; but the commonness of her own surface was a\r\nnon-conductor of the girl\'s quality. Therefore she thought that it would\r\nadd to her success in life to know a few high-flyers, if only to put\r\nthem to shame; as if anything could add to Verena\'s success, as if it\r\nwere not supreme success simply to have been made as she was made.\r\n\r\nMrs. Tarrant had gone into town to call upon Miss Chancellor; she\r\ncarried out this resolve, on which she had bestowed infinite\r\nconsideration, independently of Verena. She had decided that she had a\r\npretext; her dignity required one, for she felt that at present the\r\nantique pride of the Greenstreets was terribly at the mercy of her\r\ncuriosity. She wished to see Miss Chancellor again, and to see her among\r\nher charming appurtenances, which Verena had described to her with great\r\nminuteness. The pretext that she would have valued most was\r\nwanting--that of Olive\'s having come out to Cambridge to pay the visit\r\nthat had been solicited from the first; so she had to take the next\r\nbest--she had to say to herself that it was her duty to see what she\r\nshould think of a place where her daughter spent so much time. To Miss\r\nChancellor she would appear to have come to thank her for her\r\nhospitality; she knew, in advance, just the air she should take (or she\r\nfancied she knew it--Mrs. Tarrant\'s were not always what she supposed),\r\njust the _nuance_ (she had also an impression she knew a little French)\r\nof her tone. Olive, after the lapse of weeks, still showed no symptoms\r\nof presenting herself, and Mrs. Tarrant rebuked Verena with some\r\nsternness for not having made her feel that this attention was due to\r\nthe mother of her friend. Verena could scarcely say to her she guessed\r\nMiss Chancellor didn\'t think much of that personage, true as it was that\r\nthe girl had discerned this angular fact, which she attributed to\r\nOlive\'s extraordinary comprehensiveness of view. Verena herself did not\r\nsuppose that her mother occupied a very important place in the universe;\r\nand Miss Chancellor never looked at anything smaller than that. Nor was\r\nshe free to report (she was certainly now less frank at home, and,\r\nmoreover, the suspicion was only just becoming distinct to her) that\r\nOlive would like to detach her from her parents altogether, and was\r\ntherefore not interested in appearing to cultivate relations with them.\r\nMrs. Tarrant, I may mention, had a further motive: she was consumed with\r\nthe desire to behold Mrs. Luna. This circumstance may operate as a proof\r\nthat the aridity of her life was great, and if it should have that\r\neffect I shall not be able to gainsay it. She had seen all the people\r\nwho went to lectures, but there were hours when she desired, for a\r\nchange, to see some who didn\'t go; and Mrs. Luna, from Verena\'s\r\ndescription of her, summed up the characteristics of this eccentric\r\nclass.\r\n\r\nVerena had given great attention to Olive\'s brilliant sister; she had\r\ntold her friend everything now--everything but one little secret,\r\nnamely, that if she could have chosen at the beginning she would have\r\nliked to resemble Mrs. Luna. This lady fascinated her, carried off her\r\nimagination to strange lands; she should enjoy so much a long evening\r\nwith her alone, when she might ask her ten thousand questions. But she\r\nnever saw her alone, never saw her at all but in glimpses. Adeline\r\nflitted in and out, dressed for dinners and concerts, always saying\r\nsomething worldly to the young woman from Cambridge, and something to\r\nOlive that had a freedom which she herself would probably never arrive\r\nat (a failure of foresight on Verena\'s part). But Miss Chancellor never\r\ndetained her, never gave Verena a chance to see her, never appeared to\r\nimagine that she could have the least interest in such a person; only\r\ntook up the subject again after Adeline had left them--the subject, of\r\ncourse, which was always the same, the subject of what they should do\r\ntogether for their suffering sex. It was not that Verena was not\r\ninterested in that--gracious, no; it opened up before her, in those\r\nwonderful colloquies with Olive, in the most inspiring way; but her\r\nfancy would make a dart to right or left when other game crossed their\r\npath, and her companion led her, intellectually, a dance in which her\r\nfeet--that is, her head--failed her at times for weariness. Mrs. Tarrant\r\nfound Miss Chancellor at home, but she was not gratified by even the\r\nmost transient glimpse of Mrs. Luna; a fact which, in her heart, Verena\r\nregarded as fortunate, inasmuch as (she said to herself) if her mother,\r\nreturning from Charles Street, began to explain Miss Chancellor to her\r\nwith fresh energy, and as if she (Verena) had never seen her, and up to\r\nthis time they had had nothing to say about her, to what developments\r\n(of the same sort) would not an encounter with Adeline have given rise?\r\n\r\nWhen Verena at last said to her friend that she thought she ought to\r\ncome out to Cambridge--she didn\'t understand why she didn\'t--Olive\r\nexpressed her reasons very frankly, admitted that she was jealous, that\r\nshe didn\'t wish to think of the girl\'s belonging to any one but herself.\r\nMr. and Mrs. Tarrant would have authority, opposed claims, and she\r\ndidn\'t wish to see them, to remember that they existed. This was true,\r\nso far as it went; but Olive could not tell Verena everything--could not\r\ntell her that she hated that dreadful pair at Cambridge. As we know, she\r\nhad forbidden herself this emotion as regards individuals; and she\r\nflattered herself that she considered the Tarrants as a type, a\r\ndeplorable one, a class that, with the public at large, discredited the\r\ncause of the new truths. She had talked them over with Miss Birdseye\r\n(Olive was always looking after her now and giving her things--the good\r\nlady appeared at this period in wonderful caps and shawls--for she felt\r\nshe couldn\'t thank her enough), and even Doctor Prance\'s fellow-lodger,\r\nwhose animosity to flourishing evils lived in the happiest (though the\r\nmost illicit) union with the mania for finding excuses, even Miss\r\nBirdseye was obliged to confess that if you came to examine his record,\r\npoor Selah didn\'t amount to so very much. How little he amounted to\r\nOlive perceived after she had made Verena talk, as the girl did\r\nimmensely, about her father and mother--quite unconscious, meanwhile, of\r\nthe conclusions she suggested to Miss Chancellor. Tarrant was a moralist\r\nwithout moral sense--that was very clear to Olive as she listened to the\r\nhistory of his daughter\'s childhood and youth, which Verena related with\r\nan extraordinary artless vividness. This narrative, tremendously\r\nfascinating to Miss Chancellor, made her feel in all sorts of\r\nways--prompted her to ask herself whether the girl was also destitute of\r\nthe perception of right and wrong. No, she was only supremely innocent;\r\nshe didn\'t understand, she didn\'t interpret nor see the _port\xe9e_ of what\r\nshe described; she had no idea whatever of judging her parents. Olive\r\nhad wished to "realise" the conditions in which her wonderful young\r\nfriend (she thought her more wonderful every day) had developed, and to\r\nthis end, as I have related, she prompted her to infinite discourse. But\r\nnow she was satisfied, the realisation was complete, and what she would\r\nhave liked to impose on the girl was an effectual rupture with her past.\r\nThat past she by no means absolutely deplored, for it had the merit of\r\nhaving initiated Verena (and her patroness, through her agency) into the\r\nmiseries and mysteries of the People. It was her theory that Verena (in\r\nspite of the blood of the Greenstreets, and, after all, who were they?)\r\nwas a flower of the great Democracy, and that it was impossible to have\r\nhad an origin less distinguished than Tarrant himself. His birth, in\r\nsome unheard-of place in Pennsylvania, was quite inexpressibly low, and\r\nOlive would have been much disappointed if it had been wanting in this\r\ndefect. She liked to think that Verena, in her childhood, had known\r\nalmost the extremity of poverty, and there was a kind of ferocity in the\r\njoy with which she reflected that there had been moments when this\r\ndelicate creature came near (if the pinch had only lasted a little\r\nlonger) to literally going without food. These things added to her value\r\nfor Olive; they made that young lady feel that their common undertaking\r\nwould, in consequence, be so much more serious. It is always supposed\r\nthat revolutionists have been goaded, and the goading would have been\r\nrather deficient here were it not for such happy accidents in Verena\'s\r\npast. When she conveyed from her mother a summons to Cambridge for a\r\nparticular occasion, Olive perceived that the great effort must now be\r\nmade. Great efforts were nothing new to her--it was a great effort to\r\nlive at all--but this one appeared to her exceptionally cruel. She\r\ndetermined, however, to make it, promising herself that her first visit\r\nto Mrs. Tarrant should also be her last. Her only consolation was that\r\nshe expected to suffer intensely; for the prospect of suffering was\r\nalways, spiritually speaking, so much cash in her pocket. It was\r\narranged that Olive should come to tea (the repast that Selah designated\r\nas his supper), when Mrs. Tarrant, as we have seen, desired to do her\r\nhonour by inviting another guest. This guest, after much deliberation\r\nbetween that lady and Verena, was selected, and the first person Olive\r\nsaw on entering the little parlour in Cambridge was a young man with\r\nhair prematurely, or, as one felt that one should say, precociously\r\nwhite, whom she had a vague impression she had encountered before, and\r\nwho was introduced to her as Mr. Matthias Pardon.\r\n\r\nShe suffered less than she had hoped--she was so taken up with the\r\nconsideration of Verena\'s interior. It was as bad as she could have\r\ndesired; desired in order to feel that (to take her out of such a\r\n_milieu_ as that) she should have a right to draw her altogether to\r\nherself. Olive wished more and more to extract some definite pledge from\r\nher; she could hardly say what it had best be as yet; she only felt that\r\nit must be something that would have an absolute sanctity for Verena and\r\nwould bind them together for life. On this occasion it seemed to shape\r\nitself in her mind; she began to see what it ought to be, though she\r\nalso saw that she would perhaps have to wait awhile. Mrs. Tarrant, too,\r\nin her own house, became now a complete figure; there was no manner of\r\ndoubt left as to her being vulgar. Olive Chancellor despised vulgarity,\r\nhad a scent for it which she followed up in her own family, so that\r\noften, with a rising flush, she detected the taint even in Adeline.\r\nThere were times, indeed, when every one seemed to have it, every one\r\nbut Miss Birdseye (who had nothing to do with it--she was an antique)\r\nand the poorest, humblest people. The toilers and spinners, the very\r\nobscure, these were the only persons who were safe from it. Miss\r\nChancellor would have been much happier if the movements she was\r\ninterested in could have been carried on only by the people she liked,\r\nand if revolutions, somehow, didn\'t always have to begin with one\'s\r\nself--with internal convulsions, sacrifices, executions. A common end,\r\nunfortunately, however fine as regards a special result, does not make\r\ncommunity impersonal.\r\n\r\nMrs. Tarrant, with her soft corpulence, looked to her guest very\r\nbleached and tumid; her complexion had a kind of withered glaze; her\r\nhair, very scanty, was drawn off her forehead _\xe0 la Chinoise_; she had\r\nno eyebrows, and her eyes seemed to stare, like those of a figure of\r\nwax. When she talked and wished to insist, and she was always insisting,\r\nshe puckered and distorted her face, with an effort to express the\r\ninexpressible, which turned out, after all, to be nothing. She had a\r\nkind of doleful elegance, tried to be confidential, lowered her voice\r\nand looked as if she wished to establish a secret understanding, in\r\norder to ask her visitor if she would venture on an apple-fritter. She\r\nwore a flowing mantle, which resembled her husband\'s waterproof--a\r\ngarment which, when she turned to her daughter or talked about her,\r\nmight have passed for the robe of a sort of priestess of maternity. She\r\nendeavoured to keep the conversation in a channel which would enable her\r\nto ask sudden incoherent questions of Olive, mainly as to whether she\r\nknew the principal ladies (the expression was Mrs. Tarrant\'s), not only\r\nin Boston, but in the other cities which, in her nomadic course, she\r\nherself had visited. Olive knew some of them, and of some of them had\r\nnever heard; but she was irritated, and pretended a universal ignorance\r\n(she was conscious that she had never told so many fibs), by which her\r\nhostess was much disconcerted, although her questions had apparently\r\nbeen questions pure and simple, leading nowhither and without bearings\r\non any new truth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\n\r\nTarrant, however, kept an eye in that direction; he was solemnly civil\r\nto Miss Chancellor, handed her the dishes at table over and over again,\r\nand ventured to intimate that the apple-fritters were very fine; but,\r\nsave for this, alluded to nothing more trivial than the regeneration of\r\nhumanity and the strong hope he felt that Miss Birdseye would again have\r\none of her delightful gatherings. With regard to this latter point he\r\nexplained that it was not in order that he might again present his\r\ndaughter to the company, but simply because on such occasions there was\r\na valuable interchange of hopeful thought, a contact of mind with mind.\r\nIf Verena had anything suggestive to contribute to the social problem,\r\nthe opportunity would come--that was part of their faith. They couldn\'t\r\nreach out for it and try and push their way; if they were wanted, their\r\nhour would strike; if they were not, they would just keep still and let\r\nothers press forward who seemed to be called. If they were called, they\r\nwould know it; and if they weren\'t, they could just hold on to each\r\nother as they had always done. Tarrant was very fond of alternatives,\r\nand he mentioned several others; it was never his fault if his listeners\r\nfailed to think him impartial. They hadn\'t much, as Miss Chancellor\r\ncould see; she could tell by their manner of life that they hadn\'t raked\r\nin the dollars; but they had faith that, whether one raised one\'s voice\r\nor simply worked on in silence, the principal difficulties would\r\nstraighten themselves out; and they had also a considerable experience\r\nof great questions. Tarrant spoke as if, as a family, they were prepared\r\nto take charge of them on moderate terms. He always said "ma\'am" in\r\nspeaking to Olive, to whom, moreover, the air had never been so filled\r\nwith the sound of her own name. It was always in her ear, save when Mrs.\r\nTarrant and Verena conversed in prolonged and ingenuous asides; this was\r\nstill for her benefit, but the pronoun sufficed them. She had wished to\r\njudge Doctor Tarrant (not that she believed he had come honestly by his\r\ntitle), to make up her mind. She had done these things now, and she\r\nexpressed to herself the kind of man she believed him to be in\r\nreflecting that if she should offer him ten thousand dollars to renounce\r\nall claim to Verena, keeping--he and his wife--clear of her for the rest\r\nof time, he would probably say, with his fearful smile, "Make it twenty,\r\nmoney down, and I\'ll do it." Some image of this transaction, as one of\r\nthe possibilities of the future, outlined itself for Olive among the\r\nmoral incisions of that evening. It seemed implied in the very place,\r\nthe bald bareness of Tarrant\'s temporary lair, a wooden cottage, with a\r\nrough front yard, a little naked piazza, which seemed rather to expose\r\nthan to protect, facing upon an unpaved road, in which the footway was\r\noverlaid with a strip of planks. These planks were embedded in ice or in\r\nliquid thaw, according to the momentary mood of the weather, and the\r\nadvancing pedestrian traversed them in the attitude, and with a good\r\ndeal of the suspense, of a rope-dancer. There was nothing in the house\r\nto speak of; nothing, to Olive\'s sense, but a smell of kerosene; though\r\nshe had a consciousness of sitting down somewhere--the object creaked\r\nand rocked beneath her--and of the table at tea being covered with a\r\ncloth stamped in bright colours.\r\n\r\nAs regards the pecuniary transaction with Selah, it was strange how she\r\nshould have seen it through the conviction that Verena would never give\r\nup her parents. Olive was sure that she would never turn her back upon\r\nthem, would always share with them. She would have despised her had she\r\nthought her capable of another course; yet it baffled her to understand\r\nwhy, when parents were so trashy, this natural law should not be\r\nsuspended. Such a question brought her back, however, to her perpetual\r\nenigma, the mystery she had already turned over in her mind for hours\r\ntogether--the wonder of such people being Verena\'s progenitors at all.\r\nShe had explained it, as we explain all exceptional things, by making\r\nthe part, as the French say, of the miraculous. She had come to consider\r\nthe girl as a wonder of wonders, to hold that no human origin, however\r\ncongruous it might superficially appear, would sufficiently account for\r\nher; that her springing up between Selah and his wife was an exquisite\r\nwhim of the creative force; and that in such a case a few shades more or\r\nless of the inexplicable didn\'t matter. It was notorious that great\r\nbeauties, great geniuses, great characters, take their own times and\r\nplaces for coming into the world, leaving the gaping spectators to make\r\nthem "fit in," and holding from far-off ancestors, or even, perhaps,\r\nstraight from the divine generosity, much more than from their ugly or\r\nstupid progenitors. They were incalculable phenomena, anyway, as Selah\r\nwould have said. Verena, for Olive, was the very type and model of the\r\n"gifted being"; her qualities had not been bought and paid for; they\r\nwere like some brilliant birthday-present, left at the door by an\r\nunknown messenger, to be delightful for ever as an inexhaustible legacy,\r\nand amusing for ever from the obscurity of its source. They were\r\nsuperabundantly crude as yet--happily for Olive, who promised herself,\r\nas we know, to train and polish them--but they were as genuine as fruit\r\nand flowers, as the glow of the fire or the plash of water. For her\r\nscrutinising friend Verena had the disposition of the artist, the spirit\r\nto which all charming forms come easily and naturally. It required an\r\neffort at first to imagine an artist so untaught, so mistaught, so poor\r\nin experience; but then it required an effort also to imagine people\r\nlike the old Tarrants, or a life so full as her life had been of ugly\r\nthings. Only an exquisite creature could have resisted such\r\nassociations, only a girl who had some natural light, some divine spark\r\nof taste. There were people like that, fresh from the hand of\r\nOmnipotence; they were far from common, but their existence was as\r\nincontestable as it was beneficent.\r\n\r\nTarrant\'s talk about his daughter, her prospects, her enthusiasm, was\r\nterribly painful to Olive; it brought back to her what she had suffered\r\nalready from the idea that he laid his hands upon her to make her speak.\r\nThat he should be mixed up in any way with this exercise of her genius\r\nwas a great injury to the cause, and Olive had already determined that\r\nin future Verena should dispense with his co-operation. The girl had\r\nvirtually confessed that she lent herself to it only because it gave him\r\npleasure, and that anything else would do as well, anything that would\r\nmake her quiet a little before she began to "give out." Olive took upon\r\nherself to believe that _she_ could make her quiet, though, certainly,\r\nshe had never had that effect upon any one; she would mount the platform\r\nwith Verena if necessary, and lay her hands upon her head. Why in the\r\nworld had a perverse fate decreed that Tarrant should take an interest\r\nin the affairs of Woman--as if she wanted _his_ aid to arrive at her\r\ngoal; a charlatan of the poor, lean, shabby sort, without the humour,\r\nbrilliancy, prestige, which sometimes throw a drapery over shallowness?\r\nMr. Pardon evidently took an interest as well, and there was something\r\nin his appearance that seemed to say that his sympathy would not be\r\ndangerous. He was much at his ease, plainly, beneath the roof of the\r\nTarrants, and Olive reflected that though Verena had told her much about\r\nhim, she had not given her the idea that he was as intimate as that.\r\nWhat she had mainly said was that he sometimes took her to the theatre.\r\nOlive could enter, to a certain extent, into that; she herself had had a\r\nphase (some time after her father\'s death--her mother\'s had preceded\r\nhis--when she bought the little house in Charles Street and began to\r\nlive alone), during which she accompanied gentlemen to respectable\r\nplaces of amusement. She was accordingly not shocked at the idea of such\r\nadventures on Verena\'s part; than which, indeed, judging from her own\r\nexperience, nothing could well have been less adventurous. Her\r\nrecollections of these expeditions were as of something solemn and\r\nedifying--of the earnest interest in her welfare exhibited by her\r\ncompanion (there were few occasions on which the young Bostonian\r\nappeared to more advantage), of the comfort of other friends sitting\r\nnear, who were sure to know whom she was with, of serious discussion\r\nbetween the acts in regard to the behaviour of the characters in the\r\npiece, and of the speech at the end with which, as the young man quitted\r\nher at her door, she rewarded his civility--"I must thank you for a very\r\npleasant evening." She always felt that she made that too prim; her lips\r\nstiffened themselves as she spoke. But the whole affair had always a\r\nprimness; this was discernible even to Olive\'s very limited sense of\r\nhumour. It was not so religious as going to evening-service at King\'s\r\nChapel; but it was the next thing to it. Of course all girls didn\'t do\r\nit; there were families that viewed such a custom with disfavour. But\r\nthis was where the girls were of the romping sort; there had to be some\r\nthings they were known not to do. As a general thing, moreover, the\r\npractice was confined to the decorous; it was a sign of culture and\r\nquiet tastes. All this made it innocent for Verena, whose life had\r\nexposed her to much worse dangers; but the thing referred itself in\r\nOlive\'s mind to a danger which cast a perpetual shadow there--the\r\npossibility of the girl\'s embarking with some ingenuous youth on an\r\nexpedition that would last much longer than an evening. She was haunted,\r\nin a word, with the fear that Verena would marry, a fate to which she\r\nwas altogether unprepared to surrender her; and this made her look with\r\nsuspicion upon all male acquaintance.\r\n\r\nMr. Pardon was not the only one she knew; she had an example of the rest\r\nin the persons of two young Harvard law-students, who presented\r\nthemselves after tea on this same occasion. As they sat there Olive\r\nwondered whether Verena had kept something from her, whether she were,\r\nafter all (like so many other girls in Cambridge), a college-"belle," an\r\nobject of frequentation to undergraduates. It was natural that at the\r\nseat of a big university there should be girls like that, with students\r\ndangling after them, but she didn\'t want Verena to be one of them. There\r\nwere some that received the Seniors and Juniors; others that were\r\naccessible to Sophomores and Freshmen. Certain young ladies\r\ndistinguished the professional students; there was a group, even, that\r\nwas on the best terms with the young men who were studying for the\r\nUnitarian ministry in that queer little barrack at the end of Divinity\r\nAvenue. The advent of the new visitors made Mrs. Tarrant bustle\r\nimmensely; but after she had caused every one to change places two or\r\nthree times with every one else the company subsided into a circle which\r\nwas occasionally broken by wandering movements on the part of her\r\nhusband, who, in the absence of anything to say on any subject whatever,\r\nplaced himself at different points in listening attitudes, shaking his\r\nhead slowly up and down, and gazing at the carpet with an air of\r\nsupernatural attention. Mrs. Tarrant asked the young men from the Law\r\nSchool about their studies, and whether they meant to follow them up\r\nseriously; said she thought some of the laws were very unjust, and she\r\nhoped they meant to try and improve them. She had suffered by the laws\r\nherself, at the time her father died; she hadn\'t got half the prop\'ty\r\nshe should have got if they had been different. She thought they should\r\nbe for public matters, not for people\'s private affairs; the idea always\r\nseemed to her to keep you down if you _were_ down, and to hedge you in\r\nwith difficulties. Sometimes she thought it was a wonder how she had\r\ndeveloped in the face of so many; but it was a proof that freedom was\r\neverywhere, if you only knew how to look for it.\r\n\r\nThe two young men were in the best humour; they greeted these sallies\r\nwith a merriment of which, though it was courteous in form, Olive was by\r\nno means unable to define the spirit. They talked naturally more with\r\nVerena than with her mother; and while they were so engaged Mrs. Tarrant\r\nexplained to her who they were, and how one of them, the smaller, who\r\nwas not quite so spruce, had brought the other, his particular friend,\r\nto introduce him. This friend, Mr. Burrage, was from New York; he was\r\nvery fashionable, he went out a great deal in Boston ("I have no doubt\r\nyou know some of the places," said Mrs. Tarrant); his "fam\'ly" was very\r\nrich.\r\n\r\n"Well, he knows plenty of that sort," Mrs. Tarrant went on, "but he felt\r\nunsatisfied; he didn\'t know any one like _us_. He told Mr. Gracie\r\n(that\'s the little one) that he felt as if he _must_; it seemed as if he\r\ncouldn\'t hold out. So we told Mr. Gracie, of course, to bring him right\r\nround. Well, I hope he\'ll get something from us, I\'m sure. He has been\r\nreported to be engaged to Miss Winkworth; I have no doubt you know who I\r\nmean. But Mr. Gracie says he hasn\'t looked at her more than twice.\r\nThat\'s the way rumours fly round in that set, I presume. Well, I am glad\r\nwe are not in it, wherever we are! Mr. Gracie is very different; he is\r\nintensely plain, but I believe he is very learned. You don\'t think him\r\nplain? Oh, you don\'t know? Well, I suppose you don\'t care, you must see\r\nso many. But I must say, when a young man looks like that, I call him\r\npainfully plain. I heard Doctor Tarrant make the remark the last time he\r\nwas here. I don\'t say but what the plainest are the best. Well, I had no\r\nidea we were going to have a party when I asked you. I wonder whether\r\nVerena hadn\'t better hand the cake; we generally find the students enjoy\r\nit so much."\r\n\r\nThis office was ultimately delegated to Selah, who, after a considerable\r\nabsence, reappeared with a dish of dainties, which he presented\r\nsuccessively to each member of the company. Olive saw Verena lavish her\r\nsmiles on Mr. Gracie and Mr. Burrage; the liveliest relation had\r\nestablished itself, and the latter gentleman in especial abounded in\r\nappreciative laughter. It might have been fancied, just from looking at\r\nthe group, that Verena\'s vocation was to smile and talk with young men\r\nwho bent towards her; might have been fancied, that is, by a person less\r\nsure of the contrary than Olive, who had reason to know that a "gifted\r\nbeing" is sent into the world for a very different purpose, and that\r\nmaking the time pass pleasantly for conceited young men is the last duty\r\nyou are bound to think of if you happen to have a talent for embodying a\r\ncause. Olive tried to be glad that her friend had the richness of nature\r\nthat makes a woman gracious without latent purposes; she reflected that\r\nVerena was not in the smallest degree a flirt, that she was only\r\nenchantingly and universally genial, that nature had given her a\r\nbeautiful smile, which fell impartially on every one, man and woman,\r\nalike. Olive may have been right, but it shall be confided to the reader\r\nthat in reality she never knew, by any sense of her own, whether Verena\r\nwere a flirt or not. This young lady could not possibly have told her\r\n(even if she herself knew, which she didn\'t), and Olive, destitute of\r\nthe quality, had no means of taking the measure in another of the subtle\r\nfeminine desire to please. She could see the difference between Mr.\r\nGracie and Mr. Burrage; her being bored by Mrs. Tarrant\'s attempting to\r\npoint it out is perhaps a proof of that. It was a curious incident of\r\nher zeal for the regeneration of her sex that manly things were, perhaps\r\non the whole, what she understood best. Mr. Burrage was rather a\r\nhandsome youth, with a laughing, clever face, a certain sumptuosity of\r\napparel, an air of belonging to the "fast set"--a precocious,\r\ngood-natured man of the world, curious of new sensations and containing,\r\nperhaps, the making of a _dilettante_. Being, doubtless, a little\r\nambitious, and liking to flatter himself that he appreciated worth in\r\nlowly forms, he had associated himself with the ruder but at the same\r\ntime acuter personality of a genuine son of New England, who had a\r\nharder head than his own and a humour in reality more cynical, and who,\r\nhaving earlier knowledge of the Tarrants, had undertaken to show him\r\nsomething indigenous and curious, possibly even fascinating. Mr. Gracie\r\nwas short, with a big head; he wore eye-glasses, looked unkempt, almost\r\nrustic, and said good things with his ugly lips. Verena had replies for\r\na good many of them, and a pretty colour came into her face as she\r\ntalked. Olive could see that she produced herself quite as well as one\r\nof these gentlemen had foretold the other that she would. Miss\r\nChancellor knew what had passed between them as well as if she had heard\r\nit; Mr. Gracie had promised that he would lead her on, that she should\r\njustify his description and prove the raciest of her class. They would\r\nlaugh about her as they went away, lighting their cigars, and for many\r\ndays afterwards their discourse would be enlivened with quotations from\r\nthe "women\'s rights girl."\r\n\r\nIt was amazing how many ways men had of being antipathetic; these two\r\nwere very different from Basil Ransom, and different from each other,\r\nand yet the manner of each conveyed an insult to one\'s womanhood. The\r\nworst of the case was that Verena would be sure not to perceive this\r\noutrage--not to dislike them in consequence. There were so many things\r\nthat she hadn\'t yet learned to dislike, in spite of her friend\'s earnest\r\nefforts to teach her. She had the idea vividly (that was the marvel) of\r\nthe cruelty of man, of his immemorial injustice; but it remained\r\nabstract, platonic; she didn\'t detest him in consequence. What was the\r\nuse of her having that sharp, inspired vision of the history of the sex\r\n(it was, as she had said herself, exactly like Joan of Arc\'s absolutely\r\nsupernatural apprehension of the state of France) if she wasn\'t going to\r\ncarry it out, if she was going to behave as the ordinary pusillanimous,\r\nconventional young lady? It was all very well for her to have said that\r\nfirst day that she would renounce: did she look, at such a moment as\r\nthis, like a young woman who had renounced? Suppose this glittering,\r\nlaughing Burrage youth, with his chains and rings and shining shoes,\r\nshould fall in love with her and try to bribe her, with his great\r\npossessions, to practise renunciations of another kind--to give up her\r\nholy work and to go with him to New York, there to live as his wife,\r\npartly bullied, partly pampered, in the accustomed Burrage manner? There\r\nwas as little comfort for Olive as there had been on the whole alarm in\r\nthe recollection of that off-hand speech of Verena\'s about her\r\npreference for "free unions." This had been mere maiden flippancy; she\r\nhad not known the meaning of what she said. Though she had grown up\r\namong people who took for granted all sorts of queer laxities, she had\r\nkept the consummate innocence of the American girl, that innocence which\r\nwas the greatest of all, for it had survived the abolition of walls and\r\nlocks; and of the various remarks that had dropped from Verena\r\nexpressing this quality that startling observation certainly expressed\r\nit most. It implied, at any rate, that unions of some kind or other had\r\nher approval, and did not exclude the dangers that might arise from\r\nencounters with young men in search of sensations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Pardon, as Olive observed, was a little out of this combination; but\r\nhe was not a person to allow himself to droop. He came and seated\r\nhimself by Miss Chancellor and broached a literary subject; he asked her\r\nif she were following any of the current "serials" in the magazines. On\r\nher telling him that she never followed anything of that sort, he\r\nundertook a defence of the serial system, which she presently reminded\r\nhim that she had not attacked. He was not discouraged by this retort,\r\nbut glided gracefully off to the question of Mount Desert; conversation\r\non some subject or other being evidently a necessity of his nature. He\r\ntalked very quickly and softly, with words, and even sentences,\r\nimperfectly formed; there was a certain amiable flatness in his tone,\r\nand he abounded in exclamations--"Goodness gracious!" and "Mercy on\r\nus!"--not much in use among the sex whose profanity is apt to be coarse.\r\nHe had small, fair features, remarkably neat, and pretty eyes, and a\r\nmoustache that he caressed, and an air of juvenility much at variance\r\nwith his grizzled locks, and the free familiar reference in which he was\r\napt to indulge to his career as a journalist. His friends knew that in\r\nspite of his delicacy and his prattle he was what they called a live\r\nman; his appearance was perfectly reconcilable with a large degree of\r\nliterary enterprise. It should be explained that for the most part they\r\nattached to this idea the same meaning as Selah Tarrant--a state of\r\nintimacy with the newspapers, the cultivation of the great arts of\r\npublicity. For this ingenuous son of his age all distinction between the\r\nperson and the artist had ceased to exist; the writer was personal, the\r\nperson food for newsboys, and everything and every one were every one\'s\r\nbusiness. All things, with him, referred themselves to print, and print\r\nmeant simply infinite reporting, a promptitude of announcement, abusive\r\nwhen necessary, or even when not, about his fellow-citizens. He poured\r\ncontumely on their private life, on their personal appearance, with the\r\nbest conscience in the world. His faith, again, was the faith of Selah\r\nTarrant--that being in the newspapers is a condition of bliss, and that\r\nit would be fastidious to question the terms of the privilege. He was an\r\n_enfant de la balle_, as the French say; he had begun his career, at the\r\nage of fourteen, by going the rounds of the hotels, to cull flowers from\r\nthe big, greasy registers which lie on the marble counters; and he might\r\nflatter himself that he had contributed in his measure, and on behalf of\r\na vigilant public opinion, the pride of a democratic State, to the great\r\nend of preventing the American citizen from attempting clandestine\r\njourneys. Since then he had ascended other steps of the same ladder; he\r\nwas the most brilliant young interviewer on the Boston press. He was\r\nparticularly successful in drawing out the ladies; he had condensed into\r\nshorthand many of the most celebrated women of his time--some of these\r\ndaughters of fame were very voluminous--and he was supposed to have a\r\nremarkably insinuating way of waiting upon _prime donne_ and actresses\r\nthe morning after their arrival, or sometimes the very evening, while\r\ntheir luggage was being brought up. He was only twenty-eight years old,\r\nand, with his hoary head, was a thoroughly modern young man; he had no\r\nidea of not taking advantage of all the modern conveniences. He regarded\r\nthe mission of mankind upon earth as a perpetual evolution of telegrams;\r\neverything to him was very much the same, he had no sense of proportion\r\nor quality; but the newest thing was what came nearest exciting in his\r\nmind the sentiment of respect. He was an object of extreme admiration to\r\nSelah Tarrant, who believed that he had mastered all the secrets of\r\nsuccess, and who, when Mrs. Tarrant remarked (as she had done more than\r\nonce) that it looked as if Mr. Pardon was really coming after Verena,\r\ndeclared that if he was, he was one of the few young men he should want\r\nto see in that connexion, one of the few he should be willing to allow\r\nto handle her. It was Tarrant\'s conviction that if Matthias Pardon\r\nshould seek Verena in marriage, it would be with a view to producing her\r\nin public; and the advantage for the girl of having a husband who was at\r\nthe same time reporter, interviewer, manager, agent, who had the command\r\nof the principal "dailies," would write her up and work her, as it were,\r\nscientifically--the attraction of all this was too obvious to be\r\ninsisted on. Matthias had a mean opinion of Tarrant, thought him quite\r\nsecond-rate, a votary of played-out causes. It was his impression that\r\nhe himself was in love with Verena, but his passion was not a jealous\r\none, and included a remarkable disposition to share the object of his\r\naffection with the American people.\r\n\r\nHe talked some time to Olive about Mount Desert, told her that in his\r\nletters he had described the company at the different hotels. He\r\nremarked, however, that a correspondent suffered a good deal to-day from\r\nthe competition of the "lady-writers"; the sort of article they produced\r\nwas sometimes more acceptable to the papers. He supposed she would be\r\nglad to hear that--he knew she was so interested in woman\'s having a\r\nfree field. They certainly made lovely correspondents; they picked up\r\nsomething bright before you could turn round; there wasn\'t much you\r\ncould keep away from them; you had to be lively if you wanted to get\r\nthere first. Of course, they were naturally more chatty, and that was\r\nthe style of literature that seemed to take most to-day; only they\r\ndidn\'t write much but what ladies would want to read. Of course, he knew\r\nthere were millions of lady-readers, but he intimated that _he_ didn\'t\r\naddress himself exclusively to the gynec\xe6um; he tried to put in\r\nsomething that would interest all parties. If you read a lady\'s letter\r\nyou knew pretty well in advance what you would find. Now, what he tried\r\nfor was that you shouldn\'t have the least idea; he always tried to have\r\nsomething that would make you jump. Mr. Pardon was not conceited more,\r\nat least, than is proper when youth and success go hand in hand, and it\r\nwas natural he should not know in what spirit Miss Chancellor listened\r\nto him. Being aware that she was a woman of culture his desire was\r\nsimply to supply her with the pabulum that she would expect. She thought\r\nhim very inferior; she had heard he was intensely bright, but there was\r\nprobably some mistake; there couldn\'t be any danger for Verena from a\r\nmind that took merely a gossip\'s view of great tendencies. Besides, he\r\nwasn\'t half educated, and it was her belief, or at least her hope, that\r\nan educative process was now going on for Verena (under her own\r\ndirection) which would enable her to make such a discovery for herself.\r\nOlive had a standing quarrel with the levity, the good-nature, of the\r\njudgements of the day; many of them seemed to her weak to imbecility,\r\nlosing sight of all measures and standards, lavishing superlatives,\r\ndelighted to be fooled. The age seemed to her relaxed and demoralised,\r\nand I believe she looked to the influx of the great feminine element to\r\nmake it feel and speak more sharply.\r\n\r\n"Well, it\'s a privilege to hear you two talk together," Mrs. Tarrant\r\nsaid to her; "it\'s what I call real conversation. It isn\'t often we have\r\nanything so fresh; it makes me feel as if I wanted to join in. I\r\nscarcely know whom to listen to most; Verena seems to be having such a\r\ntime with those gentlemen. First I catch one thing and then another; it\r\nseems as if I couldn\'t take it all in. Perhaps I ought to pay more\r\nattention to Mr. Burrage; I don\'t want him to think we are not so\r\ncordial as they are in New York."\r\n\r\nShe decided to draw nearer to the trio on the other side of the room,\r\nfor she had perceived (as she devoutly hoped Miss Chancellor had not)\r\nthat Verena was endeavouring to persuade either of her companions to go\r\nand talk to her dear friend, and that these unscrupulous young men,\r\nafter a glance over their shoulder, appeared to plead for remission, to\r\nintimate that this was not what they had come round for. Selah wandered\r\nout of the room again with his collection of cakes, and Mr. Pardon began\r\nto talk to Olive about Verena, to say that he felt as if he couldn\'t say\r\nall he did feel with regard to the interest she had shown in her. Olive\r\ncould not imagine why he was called upon to say or to feel anything, and\r\nshe gave him short answers; while the poor young man, unconscious of his\r\ndoom, remarked that he hoped she wasn\'t going to exercise any influence\r\nthat would prevent Miss Tarrant from taking the rank that belonged to\r\nher. He thought there was too much hanging back; he wanted to see her in\r\na front seat; he wanted to see her name in the biggest kind of bills and\r\nher portrait in the windows of the stores. She had genius, there was no\r\ndoubt of that, and she would take a new line altogether. She had charm,\r\nand there was a great demand for that nowadays in connexion with new\r\nideas. There were so many that seemed to have fallen dead for want of\r\nit. She ought to be carried straight ahead; she ought to walk right up\r\nto the top. There was a want of bold action; he didn\'t see what they\r\nwere waiting for. He didn\'t suppose they were waiting till she was fifty\r\nyears old; there were old ones enough in the field. He knew that Miss\r\nChancellor appreciated the advantage of her girlhood, because Miss\r\nVerena had told him so. Her father was dreadfully slack, and the winter\r\nwas ebbing away. Mr. Pardon went so far as to say that if Dr. Tarrant\r\ndidn\'t see his way to do something, he should feel as if he should want\r\nto take hold himself. He expressed a hope at the same time that Olive\r\nhad not any views that would lead her to bring her influence to bear to\r\nmake Miss Verena hold back; also that she wouldn\'t consider that he\r\npressed in too much. He knew that was a charge that people brought\r\nagainst newspaper-men--that they were rather apt to cross the line. He\r\nonly worried because he thought those who were no doubt nearer to Miss\r\nVerena than he could hope to be were not sufficiently alive. He knew\r\nthat she had appeared in two or three parlours since that evening at\r\nMiss Birdseye\'s, and he had heard of the delightful occasion at Miss\r\nChancellor\'s own house, where so many of the first families had been\r\ninvited to meet her. (This was an allusion to a small luncheon-party\r\nthat Olive had given, when Verena discoursed to a dozen matrons and\r\nspinsters, selected by her hostess with infinite consideration and many\r\nspiritual scruples; a report of the affair, presumably from the hand of\r\nthe young Matthias, who naturally had not been present, appeared with\r\nextraordinary promptness in an evening-paper.) That was very well so far\r\nas it went, but he wanted something on another scale, something so big\r\nthat people would have to go round if they wanted to get past. Then\r\nlowering his voice a little, he mentioned what it was: a lecture in the\r\nMusic Hall, at fifty cents a ticket, without her father, right there on\r\nher own basis. He lowered his voice still more and revealed to Miss\r\nChancellor his innermost thought, having first assured himself that\r\nSelah was still absent and that Mrs. Tarrant was inquiring of Mr.\r\nBurrage whether he visited much on the new land. The truth was, Miss\r\nVerena wanted to "shed" her father altogether; she didn\'t want him\r\npawing round her that way before she began; it didn\'t add in the least\r\nto the attraction. Mr. Pardon expressed the conviction that Miss\r\nChancellor agreed with him in this, and it required a great effort of\r\nmind on Olive\'s part, so small was her desire to act in concert with Mr.\r\nPardon, to admit to herself that she did. She asked him, with a certain\r\nlofty coldness--he didn\'t make her shy, now, a bit--whether he took a\r\ngreat interest in the improvement of the position of women. The question\r\nappeared to strike the young man as abrupt and irrelevant, to come down\r\non him from a height with which he was not accustomed to hold\r\nintercourse. He was used to quick operations, however, and he had only a\r\nmoment of bright blankness before replying:\r\n\r\n"Oh, there is nothing I wouldn\'t do for the ladies; just give me a\r\nchance and you\'ll see."\r\n\r\nOlive was silent a moment. "What I mean is--is your sympathy a sympathy\r\nwith our sex, or a particular interest in Miss Tarrant?"\r\n\r\n"Well, sympathy is just sympathy--that\'s all I can say. It takes in Miss\r\nVerena and it takes in all others--except the lady-correspondents," the\r\nyoung man added, with a jocosity which, as he perceived even at the\r\nmoment, was lost on Verena\'s friend. He was not more successful when he\r\nwent on: "It takes in even you, Miss Chancellor!"\r\n\r\nOlive rose to her feet, hesitating; she wanted to go away, and yet she\r\ncouldn\'t bear to leave Verena to be exploited, as she felt that she\r\nwould be after her departure, that indeed she had already been, by those\r\noffensive young men. She had a strange sense, too, that her friend had\r\nneglected her for the last half-hour, had not been occupied with her,\r\nhad placed a barrier between them--a barrier of broad male backs, of\r\nlaughter that verged upon coarseness, of glancing smiles directed across\r\nthe room, directed to Olive, which seemed rather to disconnect her with\r\nwhat was going forward on that side than to invite her to take part in\r\nit. If Verena recognised that Miss Chancellor was not in report, as her\r\nfather said, when jocose young men ruled the scene, the discovery\r\nimplied no great penetration; but the poor girl might have reflected\r\nfurther that to see it taken for granted that she was unadapted for such\r\ncompany could scarcely be more agreeable to Olive than to be dragged\r\ninto it. This young lady\'s worst apprehensions were now justified by\r\nMrs. Tarrant\'s crying to her that she must not go, as Mr. Burrage and\r\nMr. Gracie were trying to persuade Verena to give them a little specimen\r\nof inspirational speaking, and she was sure her daughter would comply in\r\na moment if Miss Chancellor would just tell her to compose herself. They\r\nhad got to own up to it, Miss Chancellor could do more with her than any\r\none else; but Mr. Gracie and Mr. Burrage had excited her so that she was\r\nafraid it would be rather an unsuccessful effort. The whole group had\r\ngot up, and Verena came to Olive with her hands outstretched and no\r\nsigns of a bad conscience in her bright face.\r\n\r\n"I know you like me to speak so much--I\'ll try to say something if you\r\nwant me to. But I\'m afraid there are not enough people; I can\'t do much\r\nwith a small audience."\r\n\r\n"I wish we had brought some of our friends--they would have been\r\ndelighted to come if we had given them a chance," said Mr. Burrage.\r\n"There is an immense desire throughout the University to hear you, and\r\nthere is no such sympathetic audience as an audience of Harvard men.\r\nGracie and I are only two, but Gracie is a host in himself, and I am\r\nsure he will say as much of me." The young man spoke these words freely\r\nand lightly, smiling at Verena, and even a little at Olive, with the air\r\nof one to whom a mastery of clever "chaff" was commonly attributed.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Burrage listens even better than he talks," his companion declared.\r\n"We have the habit of attention at lectures, you know. To be lectured by\r\nyou would be an advantage indeed. We are sunk in ignorance and\r\nprejudice."\r\n\r\n"Ah, my prejudices," Burrage went on; "if you could see them--I assure\r\nyou they are something monstrous!"\r\n\r\n"Give them a regular ducking and make them gasp," Matthias Pardon cried.\r\n"If you want an opportunity to act on Harvard College, now\'s your\r\nchance. These gentlemen will carry the news; it will be the narrow end\r\nof the wedge."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t tell what you like," Verena said, still looking into Olive\'s\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure Miss Chancellor likes everything here," Mrs. Tarrant remarked,\r\nwith a noble confidence.\r\n\r\nSelah had reappeared by this time; his lofty, contemplative person was\r\nframed by the doorway. "Want to try a little inspiration?" he inquired,\r\nlooking round on the circle with an encouraging inflexion.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll do it alone, if you prefer," Verena said soothingly to her friend.\r\n"It might be a good chance to try without father."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t mean to say you ain\'t going to be supported?" Mrs. Tarrant\r\nexclaimed, with dismay.\r\n\r\n"Ah, I beseech you, give us the whole programme--don\'t omit any leading\r\nfeature!" Mr. Burrage was heard to plead.\r\n\r\n"My only interest is to draw her out," said Selah, defending his\r\nintegrity. "I will drop right out if I don\'t seem to vitalise. I have no\r\ndesire to draw attention to my own poor gifts." This declaration\r\nappeared to be addressed to Miss Chancellor.\r\n\r\n"Well, there will be more inspiration if you don\'t touch her," Matthias\r\nPardon said to him. "It will seem to come right down from--well,\r\nwherever it does come from."\r\n\r\n"Yes, we don\'t pretend to say that," Mrs. Tarrant murmured.\r\n\r\nThis little discussion had brought the blood to Olive\'s face; she felt\r\nthat every one present was looking at her--Verena most of all--and that\r\nhere was a chance to take a more complete possession of the girl. Such\r\nchances were agitating; moreover, she didn\'t like, on any occasion, to\r\nbe so prominent. But everything that had been said was benighted and\r\nvulgar; the place seemed thick with the very atmosphere out of which she\r\nwished to lift Verena. They were treating her as a show, as a social\r\nresource, and the two young men from the College were laughing at her\r\nshamelessly. She was not meant for that, and Olive would save her.\r\nVerena was so simple, she couldn\'t see herself; she was the only pure\r\nspirit in the odious group.\r\n\r\n"I want you to address audiences that are worth addressing--to convince\r\npeople who are serious and sincere." Olive herself, as she spoke, heard\r\nthe great shake in her voice. "Your mission is not to exhibit yourself\r\nas a pastime for individuals, but to touch the heart of communities, of\r\nnations."\r\n\r\n"Dear madam, I\'m sure Miss Tarrant will touch my heart!" Mr. Burrage\r\nobjected, gallantly.\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t know but she judges you young men fairly," said Mrs.\r\nTarrant, with a sigh.\r\n\r\nVerena, diverted a moment from her communion with her friend, considered\r\nMr. Burrage with a smile. "I don\'t believe you have got any heart, and I\r\nshouldn\'t care much if you had!"\r\n\r\n"You have no idea how much the way you say that increases my desire to\r\nhear you speak."\r\n\r\n"Do as you please, my dear," said Olive, almost inaudibly. "My carriage\r\nmust be there--I must leave you, in any case."\r\n\r\n"I can see you don\'t want it," said Verena, wondering. "You would stay\r\nif you liked it, wouldn\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what I should do. Come out with me!" Olive spoke almost\r\nwith fierceness.\r\n\r\n"Well, you\'ll send them away no better than they came," said Matthias\r\nPardon.\r\n\r\n"I guess you had better come round some other night," Selah suggested\r\npacifically, but with a significance which fell upon Olive\'s ear.\r\n\r\nMr. Gracie seemed inclined to make the sturdiest protest. "Look here,\r\nMiss Tarrant; do you want to save Harvard College, or do you not?" he\r\ndemanded, with a humorous frown.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t know _you_ were Harvard College!" Verena returned as\r\nhumorously.\r\n\r\n"I am afraid you are rather disappointed in your evening if you expected\r\nto obtain some insight into our ideas," said Mrs. Tarrant, with an air\r\nof impotent sympathy, to Mr. Gracie.\r\n\r\n"Well, good-night, Miss Chancellor," she went on; "I hope you\'ve got a\r\nwarm wrap. I suppose you\'ll think we go a good deal by what you say in\r\nthis house. Well, most people don\'t object to that. There\'s a little\r\nhole right there in the porch; it seems as if Doctor Tarrant couldn\'t\r\nremember to go for the man to fix it. I am afraid you\'ll think we\'re too\r\nmuch taken up with all these new hopes. Well, we _have_ enjoyed seeing\r\nyou in our home; it quite raises my appetite for social intercourse. Did\r\nyou come out on wheels? I can\'t stand a sleigh myself; it makes me\r\nsick."\r\n\r\nThis was her hostess\'s response to Miss Chancellor\'s very summary\r\nfarewell, uttered as the three ladies proceeded together to the door of\r\nthe house. Olive had got herself out of the little parlour with a sort\r\nof blind, defiant dash; she had taken no perceptible leave of the rest\r\nof the company. When she was calm she had very good manners, but when\r\nshe was agitated she was guilty of lapses, every one of which came back\r\nto her, magnified, in the watches of the night. Sometimes they excited\r\nremorse, and sometimes triumph; in the latter case she felt that she\r\ncould not have been so justly vindictive in cold blood. Tarrant wished\r\nto guide her down the steps, out of the little yard, to her carriage; he\r\nreminded her that they had had ashes sprinkled on the planks on purpose.\r\nBut she begged him to let her alone, she almost pushed him back; she\r\ndrew Verena out into the dark freshness, closing the door of the house\r\nbehind her. There was a splendid sky, all blue-black and silver--a\r\nsparkling wintry vault, where the stars were like a myriad points of\r\nice. The air was silent and sharp, and the vague snow looked cruel.\r\nOlive knew now very definitely what the promise was that she wanted\r\nVerena to make; but it was too cold, she could keep her there bareheaded\r\nbut an instant. Mrs. Tarrant, meanwhile, in the parlour, remarked that\r\nit seemed as if she couldn\'t trust Verena with her own parents; and\r\nSelah intimated that, with a proper invitation, his daughter would be\r\nvery happy to address Harvard College at large. Mr. Burrage and Mr.\r\nGracie said they would invite her on the spot, in the name of the\r\nUniversity; and Matthias Pardon reflected (and asserted) with glee that\r\nthis would be the newest thing yet. But he added that they would have a\r\nhigh time with Miss Chancellor first, and this was evidently the\r\nconviction of the company.\r\n\r\n"I can see you are angry at something," Verena said to Olive, as the two\r\nstood there in the starlight. "I hope it isn\'t me. What have I done?"\r\n\r\n"I am not angry--I am anxious. I am so afraid I shall lose you. Verena,\r\ndon\'t fail me--don\'t fail me!" Olive spoke low, with a kind of passion.\r\n\r\n"Fail you? How can I fail?"\r\n\r\n"You can\'t, of course you can\'t. Your star is above you. But don\'t\r\nlisten to _them_."\r\n\r\n"To whom do you mean, Olive? To my parents?"\r\n\r\n"Oh no, not your parents," Miss Chancellor replied, with some sharpness.\r\nShe paused a moment, and then she said: "I don\'t care for your parents.\r\nI have told you that before; but now that I have seen them--as they\r\nwished, as you wished, and I didn\'t--I don\'t care for them; I must\r\nrepeat it, Verena. I should be dishonest if I let you think I did."\r\n\r\n"Why, Olive Chancellor!" Verena murmured, as if she were trying, in\r\nspite of the sadness produced by this declaration, to do justice to her\r\nfriend\'s impartiality.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I am hard; perhaps I am cruel; but we must be hard if we wish to\r\ntriumph. Don\'t listen to young men when they try to mock and muddle you.\r\nThey don\'t care for you; they don\'t care for _us_. They care only for\r\ntheir pleasure, for what they believe to be the right of the stronger.\r\nThe stronger? I am not so sure!"\r\n\r\n"Some of them care so much--are supposed to care too much--for us,"\r\nVerena said, with a smile that looked dim in the darkness.\r\n\r\n"Yes, if we will give up everything. I have asked you before--are you\r\nprepared to give up?"\r\n\r\n"Do you mean, to give _you_ up?"\r\n\r\n"No, all our wretched sisters--all our hopes and purposes--all that we\r\nthink Sacred and worth living for!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, they don\'t want that, Olive." Verena\'s smile became more distinct,\r\nand she added: "They don\'t want so much as that!"\r\n\r\n"Well, then, go in and speak for them--and sing for them--and dance for\r\nthem!"\r\n\r\n"Olive, you are cruel!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I am. But promise me one thing, and I shall be--oh, so tender!"\r\n\r\n"What a strange place for promises," said Verena, with a shiver, looking\r\nabout her into the night.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I am dreadful; I know it. But promise." And Olive drew the girl\r\nnearer to her, flinging over her with one hand the fold of a cloak that\r\nhung ample upon her own meagre person, and holding her there with the\r\nother, while she looked at her, suppliant but half hesitating.\r\n"Promise!" she repeated.\r\n\r\n"Is it something terrible?"\r\n\r\n"Never to listen to one of them, never to be bribed----"\r\n\r\nAt this moment the house-door was opened again, and the light of the\r\nhall projected itself across the little piazza. Matthias Pardon stood in\r\nthe aperture, and Tarrant and his wife, with the two other visitors,\r\nappeared to have come forward as well, to see what detained Verena.\r\n\r\n"You seem to have started a kind of lecture out here," Mr. Pardon said.\r\n"You ladies had better look out, or you\'ll freeze together!"\r\n\r\nVerena was reminded by her mother that she would catch her death, but\r\nshe had already heard sharply, low as they were spoken, five last words\r\nfrom Olive, who now abruptly released her and passed swiftly over the\r\npath from the porch to her waiting carriage. Tarrant creaked along, in\r\npursuit, to assist Miss Chancellor; the others drew Verena into the\r\nhouse. "Promise me not to marry!"--that was what echoed in her startled\r\nmind, and repeated itself there when Mr. Burrage returned to the charge,\r\nasking her if she wouldn\'t at least appoint some evening when they might\r\nlisten to her. She knew that Olive\'s injunction ought not to have\r\nsurprised her; she had already felt it in the air; she would have said\r\nat any time, if she had been asked, that she didn\'t suppose Miss\r\nChancellor would want her to marry. But the idea, uttered as her friend\r\nhad uttered it, had a new solemnity, and the effect of that quick,\r\nviolent colloquy was to make her nervous and impatient, as if she had\r\nhad a sudden glimpse of futurity. That was rather awful, even if it\r\nrepresented the fate one would like.\r\n\r\nWhen the two young men from the College pressed their petition, she\r\nasked, with a laugh that surprised them, whether they wished to "mock\r\nand muddle" her. They went away, assenting to Mrs. Tarrant\'s last\r\nremark: "I am afraid you\'ll feel that you don\'t quite understand us\r\nyet." Matthias Pardon remained; her father and mother, expressing their\r\nperfect confidence that he would excuse them, went to bed and left him\r\nsitting there. He stayed a good while longer, nearly an hour, and said\r\nthings that made Verena think that _he_, perhaps, would like to marry\r\nher. But while she listened to him, more abstractedly than her custom\r\nwas, she remarked to herself that there could be no difficulty in\r\npromising Olive so far as he was concerned. He was very pleasant, and he\r\nknew an immense deal about everything, or, rather, about every one, and\r\nhe would take her right into the midst of life. But she didn\'t wish to\r\nmarry him, all the same, and after he had gone she reflected that, once\r\nshe came to think of it, she didn\'t want to marry any one. So it would\r\nbe easy, after all, to make Olive that promise, and it would give her so\r\nmuch pleasure!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next time Verena saw Olive she said to her that she was ready to\r\nmake the promise she had asked the other night; but, to her great\r\nsurprise, this young woman answered her by a question intended to check\r\nsuch rashness. Miss Chancellor raised a warning finger; she had an air\r\nof dissuasion almost as solemn as her former pressure; her passionate\r\nimpatience appeared to have given way to other considerations, to be\r\nreplaced by the resignation that comes with deeper reflexion. It was\r\ntinged in this case, indeed, by such bitterness as might be permitted to\r\na young lady who cultivated the brightness of a great faith.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you want any promise at present?" Verena asked. "Why, Olive, how\r\nyou change!"\r\n\r\n"My dear child, you are so young--so strangely young. I am a thousand\r\nyears old; I have lived through generations--through centuries. I know\r\nwhat I know by experience; you know it by imagination. That is\r\nconsistent with your being the fresh, bright creature that you are. I am\r\nconstantly forgetting the difference between us--that you are a mere\r\nchild as yet, though a child destined for great things. I forgot it the\r\nother night, but I have remembered it since. You must pass through a\r\ncertain phase, and it would be very wrong in me to pretend to suppress\r\nit. That is all clear to me now; I see it was my jealousy that spoke--my\r\nrestless, hungry jealousy. I have far too much of that; I oughtn\'t to\r\ngive any one the right to say that it\'s a woman\'s quality. I don\'t want\r\nyour signature; I only want your confidence--only what springs from\r\nthat. I hope with all my soul that you won\'t marry; but if you don\'t it\r\nmust not be because you have promised me. You know what I think--that\r\nthere is something noble done when one makes a sacrifice for a great\r\ngood. Priests--when they were real priests--never married, and what you\r\nand I dream of doing demands of us a kind of priesthood. It seems to me\r\nvery poor, when friendship and faith and charity and the most\r\ninteresting occupation in the world--when such a combination as this\r\ndoesn\'t seem, by itself, enough to live for. No man that I have ever\r\nseen cares a straw in his heart for what we are trying to accomplish.\r\nThey hate it; they scorn it; they will try to stamp it out whenever they\r\ncan. Oh yes, I know there are men who pretend to care for it; but they\r\nare not really men, and I wouldn\'t be sure even of them! Any man that\r\none would look at--with him, as a matter of course, it is war upon us to\r\nthe knife. I don\'t mean to say there are not some male beings who are\r\nwilling to patronise us a little; to pat us on the back and recommend a\r\nfew moderate concessions; to say that there _are_ two or three little\r\npoints in which society has not been quite just to us. But any man who\r\npretends to accept our programme _in toto_, as you and I understand it,\r\nof his own free will, before he is forced to--such a person simply\r\nschemes to betray us. There are gentlemen in plenty who would be glad to\r\nstop your mouth by kissing you! If you become dangerous some day to\r\ntheir selfishness, to their vested interests, to their immorality--as I\r\npray heaven every day, my dear friend, that you may!--it will be a grand\r\nthing for one of them if he can persuade you that he loves you. Then you\r\nwill see what he will do with you, and how far his love will take him!\r\nIt would be a sad day for you and for me and for all of us if you were\r\nto believe something of that kind. You see I am very calm now; I have\r\nthought it all out."\r\n\r\nVerena had listened with earnest eyes. "Why, Olive, you are quite a\r\nspeaker yourself!" she exclaimed. "You would far surpass me if you would\r\nlet yourself go."\r\n\r\nMiss Chancellor shook her head with a melancholy that was not devoid of\r\nsweetness. "I can speak to _you_; but that is no proof. The very stones\r\nof the street--all the dumb things of nature--might find a voice to talk\r\nto you. I have no facility; I am awkward and embarrassed and dry." When\r\nthis young lady, after a struggle with the winds and waves of emotion,\r\nemerged into the quiet stream of a certain high reasonableness, she\r\npresented her most graceful aspect; she had a tone of softness and\r\nsympathy, a gentle dignity, a serenity of wisdom, which sealed the\r\nappreciation of those who knew her well enough to like her, and which\r\nalways impressed Verena as something almost august. Such moods, however,\r\nwere not often revealed to the public at large; they belonged to Miss\r\nChancellor\'s very private life. One of them had possession of her at\r\npresent, and she went on to explain the inconsequence which had puzzled\r\nher friend with the same quiet clearness, the detachment from error, of\r\na woman whose self-scrutiny has been as sharp as her deflexion.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t think me capricious if I say I would rather trust you without a\r\npledge. I owe you, I owe every one, an apology for my rudeness and\r\nfierceness at your mother\'s. It came over me--just seeing those young\r\nmen--how exposed you are; and the idea made me (for the moment) frantic.\r\nI see your danger still, but I see other things too, and I have\r\nrecovered my balance. You must be safe, Verena--you must be saved; but\r\nyour safety must not come from your having tied your hands. It must come\r\nfrom the growth of your perception; from your seeing things, of\r\nyourself, sincerely and with conviction, in the light in which I see\r\nthem; from your feeling that for your work your freedom is essential,\r\nand that there is no freedom for you and me save in religiously _not_\r\ndoing what you will often be asked to do--and I never!" Miss Chancellor\r\nbrought out these last words with a proud jerk which was not without its\r\npathos. "Don\'t promise, don\'t promise!" she went on. "I would far rather\r\nyou didn\'t. But don\'t fail me--don\'t fail me, or I shall die!"\r\n\r\nHer manner of repairing her inconsistency was altogether feminine: she\r\nwished to extract a certainty at the same time that she wished to\r\ndeprecate a pledge, and she would have been delighted to put Verena into\r\nthe enjoyment of that freedom which was so important for her by\r\npreventing her exercising it in a particular direction. The girl was now\r\ncompletely under her influence; she had latent curiosities and\r\ndistractions--left to herself, she was not always thinking of the\r\nunhappiness of women; but the touch of Olive\'s tone worked a spell, and\r\nshe found something to which at least a portion of her nature turned\r\nwith eagerness in her companion\'s wider knowledge, her elevation of\r\nview. Miss Chancellor was historic and philosophic; or, at any rate, she\r\nappeared so to Verena, who felt that through such an association one\r\nmight at last intellectually command all life. And there was a simpler\r\nimpulse; Verena wished to please her if only because she had such a\r\ndread of displeasing her. Olive\'s displeasures, disappointments,\r\ndisapprovals were tragic, truly memorable; she grew white under them,\r\nnot shedding many tears, as a general thing, like inferior women (she\r\ncried when she was angry, not when she was hurt), but limping and\r\npanting, morally, as if she had received a wound that she would carry\r\nfor life. On the other hand, her commendations, her satisfactions were\r\nas soft as a west wind; and she had this sign, the rarest of all, of\r\ngenerosity, that she liked obligations of gratitude when they were not\r\nlaid upon her by men. Then, indeed, she scarcely recognised them. She\r\nconsidered men in general as so much in the debt of the opposite sex\r\nthat any individual woman had an unlimited credit with them; she could\r\nnot possibly overdraw the general feminine account. The unexpected\r\ntemperance of her speech on this subject of Verena\'s accessibility to\r\nmatrimonial error seemed to the girl to have an antique beauty, a wisdom\r\npurged of worldly elements; it reminded her of qualities that she\r\nbelieved to have been proper to Electra or Antigone. This made her wish\r\nthe more to do something that would gratify Olive; and in spite of her\r\nfriend\'s dissuasion she declared that she should like to promise. "I\r\nwill promise, at any rate, not to marry any of those gentlemen that were\r\nat the house," she said. "Those seemed to be the ones you were\r\nprincipally afraid of."\r\n\r\n"You will promise not to marry any one you don\'t like," said Olive.\r\n"That would be a great comfort!"\r\n\r\n"But I do like Mr. Burrage and Mr. Gracie."\r\n\r\n"And Mr. Matthias Pardon? What a name!"\r\n\r\n"Well, he knows how to make himself agreeable. He can tell you\r\neverything you want to know."\r\n\r\n"You mean everything you don\'t! Well, if you like every one, I haven\'t\r\nthe least objection. It would only be preferences that I should find\r\nalarming. I am not the least afraid of your marrying a repulsive man;\r\nyour danger would come from an attractive one."\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad to hear you admit that some _are_ attractive!" Verena\r\nexclaimed, with the light laugh which her reverence for Miss Chancellor\r\nhad not yet quenched. "It sometimes seems as if there weren\'t any you\r\ncould like!"\r\n\r\n"I can imagine a man I should like very much," Olive replied, after a\r\nmoment. "But I don\'t like those I see. They seem to me poor creatures."\r\nAnd, indeed, her uppermost feeling in regard to them was a kind of cold\r\nscorn; she thought most of them palterers and bullies. The end of the\r\ncolloquy was that Verena, having assented, with her usual docility, to\r\nher companion\'s optimistic contention that it was a "phase," this taste\r\nfor evening-calls from collegians and newspaper-men, and would\r\nconsequently pass away with the growth of her mind, remarked that the\r\ninjustice of men might be an accident or might be a part of their\r\nnature, but at any rate she should have to change a good deal before she\r\nshould want to marry.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of December Miss Chancellor received a visit from\r\nMatthias Pardon, who had come to ask her what she meant to do about\r\nVerena. She had never invited him to call upon her, and the appearance\r\nof a gentleman whose desire to see her was so irrepressible as to\r\ndispense with such a preliminary was not in her career an accident\r\nfrequent enough to have taught her equanimity. She thought Mr. Pardon\'s\r\nvisit a liberty; but, if she expected to convey this idea to him by\r\nwithholding any suggestion that he should sit down, she was greatly\r\nmistaken, inasmuch as he cut the ground from under her feet by himself\r\noffering her a chair. His manner represented hospitality enough for both\r\nof them, and she was obliged to listen, on the edge of her sofa (she\r\ncould at least seat herself where she liked), to his extraordinary\r\ninquiry. Of course she was not obliged to answer it, and indeed she\r\nscarcely understood it. He explained that it was prompted by the intense\r\ninterest he felt in Miss Verena; but that scarcely made it more\r\ncomprehensible, such a sentiment (on his part) being such a curious\r\nmixture. He had a sort of enamel of good humour which showed that his\r\nindelicacy was his profession; and he asked for revelations of the _vie\r\nintime_ of his victims with the bland confidence of a fashionable\r\nphysician inquiring about symptoms. He wanted to know what Miss\r\nChancellor meant to do, because if she didn\'t mean to do anything, he\r\nhad an idea--which he wouldn\'t conceal from her--of going into the\r\nenterprise himself. "You see, what I should like to know is this: do you\r\nconsider that she belongs to you, or that she belongs to the people? If\r\nshe belongs to you, why don\'t you bring her out?"\r\n\r\nHe had no purpose and no consciousness of being impertinent; he only\r\nwished to talk over the matter sociably with Miss Chancellor. He knew,\r\nof course, that there was a presumption she would not be sociable, but\r\nno presumption had yet deterred him from presenting a surface which he\r\nbelieved to be polished till it shone; there was always a larger one in\r\nfavour of his power to penetrate and of the majesty of the "great\r\ndailies." Indeed, he took so many things for granted that Olive remained\r\ndumb while she regarded them; and he availed himself of what he\r\nconsidered as a fortunate opening to be really very frank. He reminded\r\nher that he had known Miss Verena a good deal longer than she; he had\r\ntravelled out to Cambridge the other winter (when he could get an\r\noff-night), with the thermometer at ten below zero. He had always\r\nthought her attractive, but it wasn\'t till this season that his eyes had\r\nbeen fully opened. Her talent had matured, and now he had no hesitation\r\nin calling her brilliant. Miss Chancellor could imagine whether, as an\r\nold friend, he could watch such a beautiful unfolding with indifference.\r\nShe would fascinate the people, just as she had fascinated her (Miss\r\nChancellor), and, he might be permitted to add, himself. The fact was,\r\nshe was a great card, and some one ought to play it. There never had\r\nbeen a more attractive female speaker before the American public; she\r\nwould walk right past Mrs. Farrinder, and Mrs. Farrinder knew it. There\r\nwas room for both, no doubt, they had such a different style; anyhow,\r\nwhat he wanted to show was that there was room for Miss Verena. She\r\ndidn\'t want any more tuning-up, she wanted to break right out. Moreover,\r\nhe felt that any gentleman who should lead her to success would win her\r\nesteem; he might even attract her more powerfully--who could tell? If\r\nMiss Chancellor wanted to attach her permanently, she ought to push her\r\nright forward. He gathered from what Miss Verena had told him that she\r\nwanted to make her study up the subject a while longer--follow some kind\r\nof course. Well, now, he could assure her that there was no preparation\r\nso good as just seeing a couple of thousand people down there before you\r\nwho have paid their money to have you tell them something. Miss Verena\r\nwas a natural genius, and he hoped very much she wasn\'t going to take\r\nthe nature out of her. She could study up as she went along; she had got\r\nthe great thing that you couldn\'t learn, a kind of divine afflatus, as\r\nthe ancients used to say, and she had better just begin on that. He\r\nwouldn\'t deny what was the matter with _him_; he was quite under the\r\nspell, and his admiration made him want to see her where she belonged.\r\nHe shouldn\'t care so much how she got there, but it would certainly add\r\nto his pleasure if he could show her up to her place. Therefore, would\r\nMiss Chancellor just tell him this: How long did she expect to hold her\r\nback; how long did she expect a humble admirer to wait? Of course he\r\nhadn\'t come there to cross-question her; there was one thing he trusted\r\nhe always kept clear of; when he was indiscreet he wanted to know it. He\r\nhad come with a proposal of his own, and he hoped it would seem a\r\nsufficient warrant for his visit. Would Miss Chancellor be willing to\r\ndivide a--the--well, he might call it the responsibilities? Couldn\'t\r\nthey run Miss Verena together? In this case every one would be\r\nsatisfied. She could travel round with her as her companion, and he\r\nwould see that the American people walked up. If Miss Chancellor would\r\njust let her go a little, he would look after the rest. He wanted no\r\nodds; he only wanted her for about an hour and a half three or four\r\nevenings a week.\r\n\r\nOlive had time, in the course of this appeal, to make her faculties\r\nconverge, to ask herself what she could say to this prodigious young man\r\nthat would make him feel as how base a thing she held his proposal that\r\nthey should constitute themselves into a company for drawing profit from\r\nVerena. Unfortunately, the most sarcastic inquiry that could occur to\r\nher as a response was also the most obvious one, so that he hesitated\r\nbut a moment with his rejoinder after she had asked him how many\r\nthousands of dollars he expected to make.\r\n\r\n"For Miss Verena? It depends upon the time. She\'d run for ten years, at\r\nleast. I can\'t figure it up till all the States have been heard from,"\r\nhe said, smiling.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t mean for Miss Tarrant, I mean for you," Olive returned, with\r\nthe impression that she was looking him straight in the eye.\r\n\r\n"Oh, as many as you\'ll leave me!" Matthias Pardon answered, with a laugh\r\nthat contained all, and more than all, the jocularity of the American\r\npress. "To speak seriously," he added, "I don\'t want to make money out\r\nof it."\r\n\r\n"What do you want to make then?"\r\n\r\n"Well, I want to make history! I want to help the ladies."\r\n\r\n"The ladies?" Olive murmured. "What do you know about ladies?" she was\r\non the point of adding, when his promptness checked her.\r\n\r\n"All over the world. I want to work for their emancipation. I regard it\r\nas the great modern question."\r\n\r\nMiss Chancellor got up now; this was rather too strong. Whether,\r\neventually, she was successful in what she attempted, the reader of her\r\nhistory will judge; but at this moment she had not that promise of\r\nsuccess which resides in a willingness to make use of every aid that\r\noffers. Such is the penalty of being of a fastidious, exclusive,\r\nuncompromising nature; of seeing things not simply and sharply, but in\r\nperverse relations, in intertwisted strands. It seemed to our young lady\r\nthat nothing could be less attractive than to owe her emancipation to\r\nsuch a one as Matthias Pardon; and it is curious that those qualities\r\nwhich he had in common with Verena, and which in her seemed to Olive\r\nromantic and touching--her having sprung from the "people," had an\r\nacquaintance with poverty, a hand-to-mouth development, and an\r\nexperience of the seamy side of life--availed in no degree to conciliate\r\nMiss Chancellor. I suppose it was because he was a man. She told him\r\nthat she was much obliged to him for his offer, but that he evidently\r\ndidn\'t understand Verena and herself. No, not even Miss Tarrant, in\r\nspite of his long acquaintance with her. They had no desire to be\r\nnotorious; they only wanted to be useful. They had no wish to make\r\nmoney; there would always be plenty of money for Miss Tarrant.\r\nCertainly, she should come before the public, and the world would\r\nacclaim her and hang upon her words; but crude, precipitate action was\r\nwhat both of them least desired. The change in the dreadful position of\r\nwomen was not a question for to-day simply, or for to-morrow, but for\r\nmany years to come; and there would be a great deal to think of, to map\r\nout. One thing they were determined upon--that men shouldn\'t taunt them\r\nwith being superficial. When Verena should appear it would be armed at\r\nall points, like Joan of Arc (this analogy had lodged itself in Olive\'s\r\nimagination); she should have facts and figures; she should meet men on\r\ntheir own ground. "What we mean to do, we mean to do well," Miss\r\nChancellor said to her visitor, with considerable sternness; leaving him\r\nto make such an application to himself as his fancy might suggest.\r\n\r\nThis announcement had little comfort for him; he felt baffled and\r\ndisheartened--indeed, quite sick. Was it not sickening to hear her talk\r\nof this dreary process of preparation?--as if any one cared about that,\r\nand would know whether Verena were prepared or not! Had Miss Chancellor\r\nno faith in her girlhood? didn\'t she know what a card that would be?\r\nThis was the last inquiry Olive allowed him the opportunity of making.\r\nShe remarked to him that they might talk for ever without coming to an\r\nagreement--their points of view were so far apart. Besides, it was a\r\nwoman\'s question; what they wanted was for women, and it should be by\r\nwomen. It had happened to the young Matthias more than once to be shown\r\nthe way to the door, but the path of retreat had never yet seemed to him\r\nso unpleasant. He was naturally amiable, but it had not hitherto\r\nbefallen him to be made to feel that he was not--and could not be--a\r\nfactor in contemporary history: here was a rapacious woman who proposed\r\nto keep that favourable setting for herself. He let her know that she\r\nwas right-down selfish, and that if she chose to sacrifice a beautiful\r\nnature to her antediluvian theories and love of power, a vigilant daily\r\npress--whose business it was to expose wrong-doing--would demand an\r\naccount from her. She replied that, if the newspapers chose to insult\r\nher, that was their own affair; one outrage the more to the sex in her\r\nperson was of little account. And after he had left her she seemed to\r\nsee the glow of dawning success; the battle had begun, and something of\r\nthe ecstasy of the martyr.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nVerena told her, a week after this, that Mr. Pardon wanted so much she\r\nshould say she would marry him; and she added, with evident pleasure at\r\nbeing able to give her so agreeable a piece of news, that she had\r\ndeclined to say anything of the sort. She thought that now, at least,\r\nOlive must believe in her; for the proposal was more attractive than\r\nMiss Chancellor seemed able to understand. "He does place things in a\r\nvery seductive light," Verena said; "he says that if I become his wife I\r\nshall be carried straight along by a force of excitement of which at\r\npresent I have no idea. I shall wake up famous, if I marry him; I have\r\nonly got to give out my feelings, and he will take care of the rest. He\r\nsays every hour of my youth is precious to me, and that we should have a\r\nlovely time travelling round the country. I think you ought to allow\r\nthat all that is rather dazzling--for I am not naturally concentrated,\r\nlike you!"\r\n\r\n"He promises you success. What do you call success?" Olive inquired,\r\nlooking at her friend with a kind of salutary coldness--a suspension of\r\nsympathy--with which Verena was now familiar (though she liked it no\r\nbetter than at first), and which made approbation more gracious when\r\napprobation came.\r\n\r\nVerena reflected a moment, and then answered, smiling, but with\r\nconfidence: "Producing a pressure that shall be irresistible. Causing\r\ncertain laws to be repealed by Congress and by the State legislatures,\r\nand others to be enacted." She repeated the words as if they had been\r\npart of a catechism committed to memory, while Olive saw that this\r\nmechanical tone was in the nature of a joke that she could not deny\r\nherself; they had had that definition so often before, and Miss\r\nChancellor had had occasion so often to remind her what success _really_\r\nwas. Of course it was easy to prove to her now that Mr. Pardon\'s\r\nglittering bait was a very different thing; was a mere trap and lure, a\r\nbribe to vanity and impatience, a device for making her give herself\r\naway--let alone fill his pockets while she did so. Olive was conscious\r\nenough of the girl\'s want of continuity; she had seen before how she\r\ncould be passionately serious at times, and then perversely, even if\r\ninnocently, trivial--as just now, when she seemed to wish to convert one\r\nof their most sacred formulas into a pleasantry. She had already quite\r\nrecognised, however, that it was not of importance that Verena should be\r\njust like herself; she was all of one piece, and Verena was of many\r\npieces, which had, where they fitted together, little capricious chinks,\r\nthrough which mocking inner lights seemed sometimes to gleam. It was a\r\npart of Verena\'s being unlike her that she should feel Mr. Pardon\'s\r\npromise of eternal excitement to be a brilliant thing, should indeed\r\nconsider Mr. Pardon with any tolerance at all. But Olive tried afresh to\r\nallow for such aberrations, as a phase of youth and suburban culture;\r\nthe more so that, even when she tried most, Verena reproached her--so\r\nfar as Verena\'s incurable softness could reproach--with not allowing\r\nenough. Olive didn\'t appear to understand that, while Matthias Pardon\r\ndrew that picture and tried to hold her hand (this image was\r\nunfortunate), she had given one long, fixed, wistful look, through the\r\ndoor he opened, at the bright tumult of the world, and then had turned\r\naway, solely for her friend\'s sake, to an austerer probation and a purer\r\neffort; solely for her friend\'s, that is, and that of the whole enslaved\r\nsisterhood. The fact remained, at any rate, that Verena had made a\r\nsacrifice; and this thought, after a while, gave Olive a greater sense\r\nof security. It seemed almost to seal the future; for Olive knew that\r\nthe young interviewer would not easily be shaken off, and yet she was\r\nsure that Verena would never yield to him.\r\n\r\nIt was true that at present Mr. Burrage came a great deal to the little\r\nhouse at Cambridge; Verena told her about that, told her so much that it\r\nwas almost as good as if she had told her all. He came without Mr.\r\nGracie now; he could find his way alone, and he seemed to wish that\r\nthere should be no one else. He had made himself so pleasant to her\r\nmother that she almost always went out of the room; that was the\r\nhighest proof Mrs. Tarrant could give of her appreciation of a\r\n"gentleman-caller." They knew everything about him by this time; that\r\nhis father was dead, his mother very fashionable and prominent, and he\r\nhimself in possession of a handsome patrimony. They thought ever so much\r\nof him in New York. He collected beautiful things, pictures and antiques\r\nand objects that he sent for to Europe on purpose, many of which were\r\narranged in his rooms at Cambridge. He had intaglios and Spanish\r\naltar-cloths and drawings by the old masters. He was different from most\r\nothers; he seemed to want so much to enjoy life, and to think you easily\r\ncould if you would only let yourself go. Of course--judging by what _he_\r\nhad--he appeared to think you required a great many things to keep you\r\nup. And then Verena told Olive--she could see it was after a little\r\ndelay--that he wanted her to come round to his place and see his\r\ntreasures. He wanted to show them to her, he was so sure she would\r\nadmire them. Verena was sure also, but she wouldn\'t go alone, and she\r\nwanted Olive to go with her. They would have tea, and there would be\r\nother ladies, and Olive would tell her what she thought of a life that\r\nwas so crowded with beauty. Miss Chancellor made her reflexions on all\r\nthis, and the first of them was that it was happy for her that she had\r\ndetermined for the present to accept these accidents, for otherwise\r\nmight she not now have had a deeper alarm? She wished to heaven that\r\nconceited young men with time on their hands would leave Verena alone;\r\nbut evidently they wouldn\'t, and her best safety was in seeing as many\r\nas should turn up. If the type should become frequent, she would very\r\nsoon judge it. If Olive had not been so grim, she would have had a smile\r\nto spare for the frankness with which the girl herself adopted this\r\ntheory. She was eager to explain that Mr. Burrage didn\'t seem at all to\r\nwant what poor Mr. Pardon had wanted; he made her talk about her views\r\nfar more than that gentleman, but gave no sign of offering himself\r\neither as a husband or as a lecture-agent. The furthest he had gone as\r\nyet was to tell her that he liked her for the same reason that he liked\r\nold enamels and old embroideries; and when she said that she didn\'t see\r\nhow she resembled such things, he had replied that it was because she\r\nwas so peculiar and so delicate. She might be peculiar, but she had\r\nprotested against the idea that she was delicate; it was the last thing\r\nthat she wanted to be thought; and Olive could see from this how far she\r\nwas from falling in with everything he said. When Miss Chancellor asked\r\nif she respected Mr. Burrage (and how solemn Olive could make that word\r\nshe by this time knew), she answered, with her sweet, vain laugh, but\r\napparently with perfect good faith, that it didn\'t matter whether she\r\ndid or not, for what was the whole thing but simply a phase--the very\r\none they had talked about? The sooner she got through it the better, was\r\nit not?--and she seemed to think that her transit would be materially\r\nquickened by a visit to Mr. Burrage\'s rooms. As I say, Verena was\r\npleased to regard the phase as quite inevitable, and she had said more\r\nthan once to Olive that if their struggle was to be with men, the more\r\nthey knew about them the better. Miss Chancellor asked her why her\r\nmother should not go with her to see the curiosities, since she\r\nmentioned that their possessor had not neglected to invite Mrs. Tarrant;\r\nand Verena said that this, of course, would be very simple--only her\r\nmother wouldn\'t be able to tell her so well as Olive whether she ought\r\nto respect Mr. Burrage. This decision as to whether Mr. Burrage should\r\nbe respected assumed in the life of these two remarkable young women,\r\npitched in so high a moral key, the proportions of a momentous event.\r\nOlive shrank at first from facing it--not, indeed, the decision--for we\r\nknow that her own mind had long since been made up in regard to the\r\nquantity of esteem due to almost any member of the other sex--but the\r\nincident itself, which, if Mr. Burrage should exasperate her further,\r\nmight expose her to the danger of appearing to Verena to be unfair to\r\nhim. It was her belief that he was playing a deeper game than the young\r\nMatthias, and she was very willing to watch him; but she thought it\r\nprudent not to attempt to cut short the phase (she adopted that\r\nclassification) prematurely--an imputation she should incur if, without\r\nmore delay, she were to "shut down," as Verena said, on the young\r\nconnoisseur.\r\n\r\nIt was settled, therefore, that Mrs. Tarrant should, with her daughter,\r\naccept Mr. Burrage\'s invitation; and in a few days these ladies paid a\r\nvisit to his apartments. Verena subsequently, of course, had much to say\r\nabout it, but she dilated even more upon her mother\'s impressions than\r\nupon her own. Mrs. Tarrant had carried away a supply which would last\r\nher all winter; there had been some New York ladies present who were\r\n"on" at that moment, and with whom her intercourse was rich in emotions.\r\nShe had told them all that she should be happy to see them in her home,\r\nbut they had not yet picked their way along the little planks of the\r\nfront yard. Mr. Burrage, at all events, had been quite lovely, and had\r\ntalked about his collections, which were wonderful, in the most\r\ninteresting manner. Verena inclined to think he was to be respected. He\r\nadmitted that he was not really studying law at all; he had only come to\r\nCambridge for the form; but she didn\'t see why it wasn\'t enough when you\r\nmade yourself as pleasant as that. She went so far as to ask Olive\r\nwhether taste and art were not something, and her friend could see that\r\nshe was certainly very much involved in the phase. Miss Chancellor, of\r\ncourse, had her answer ready. Taste and art were good when they enlarged\r\nthe mind, not when they narrowed it. Verena assented to this, and said\r\nit remained to be seen what effect they had had upon Mr. Burrage--a\r\nremark which led Olive to fear that at such a rate much would remain,\r\nespecially when Verena told her, later, that another visit to the young\r\nman\'s rooms was projected, and that this time she must come, he having\r\nexpressed the greatest desire for the honour, and her own wish being\r\ngreater still that they should look at some of his beautiful things\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nA day or two after this, Mr. Henry Burrage left a card at Miss\r\nChancellor\'s door, with a note in which he expressed the hope that she\r\nwould take tea with him on a certain day on which he expected the\r\ncompany of his mother. Olive responded to this invitation, in\r\nconjunction with Verena; but in doing so she was in the position,\r\nsingular for her, of not quite understanding what she was about. It\r\nseemed to her strange that Verena should urge her to take such a step\r\nwhen she was free to go without her, and it proved two things: first,\r\nthat she was much interested in Mr. Henry Burrage, and second, that her\r\nnature was extraordinarily beautiful. Could anything, in effect, be less\r\nunderhand than such an indifference to what she supposed to be the best\r\nopportunities for carrying on a flirtation? Verena wanted to know the\r\ntruth, and it was clear that by this time she believed Olive Chancellor\r\nto have it, for the most part, in her keeping. Her insistence,\r\ntherefore, proved, above all, that she cared more for her friend\'s\r\nopinion of Henry Burrage than for her own--a reminder, certainly, of the\r\nresponsibility that Olive had incurred in undertaking to form this\r\ngenerous young mind, and of the exalted place that she now occupied in\r\nit. Such revelations ought to have been satisfactory; if they failed to\r\nbe completely so, it was only on account of the elder girl\'s regret that\r\nthe subject as to which her judgement was wanted should be a young man\r\ndestitute of the worst vices. Henry Burrage had contributed to throw\r\nMiss Chancellor into a "state," as these young ladies called it, the\r\nnight she met him at Mrs. Tarrant\'s; but it had none the less been\r\nconveyed to Olive by the voices of the air that he was a gentleman and a\r\ngood fellow.\r\n\r\nThis was painfully obvious when the visit to his rooms took place; he\r\nwas so good-humoured, so amusing, so friendly and considerate, so\r\nattentive to Miss Chancellor, he did the honours of his bachelor-nest\r\nwith so easy a grace, that Olive, part of the time, sat dumbly shaking\r\nher conscience, like a watch that wouldn\'t go, to make it tell her some\r\nbetter reason why she shouldn\'t like him. She saw that there would be no\r\ndifficulty in disliking his mother; but that, unfortunately, would not\r\nserve her purpose nearly so well. Mrs. Burrage had come to spend a few\r\ndays near her son; she was staying at an hotel in Boston. It presented\r\nitself to Olive that after this entertainment it would be an act of\r\ncourtesy to call upon her; but here, at least, was the comfort that she\r\ncould cover herself with the general absolution extended to the Boston\r\ntemperament and leave her alone. It was slightly provoking, indeed, that\r\nMrs. Burrage should have so much the air of a New Yorker who didn\'t\r\nparticularly notice whether a Bostonian called or not; but there is ever\r\nan imperfection, I suppose, in even the sweetest revenge. She was a\r\nwoman of society, large and voluminous, fair (in complexion) and\r\nregularly ugly, looking as if she ought to be slow and rather heavy, but\r\ndisappointing this expectation by a quick, amused utterance, a short,\r\nbright, summary laugh, with which she appeared to dispose of the joke\r\n(whatever it was) for ever, and an air of recognising on the instant\r\neverything she saw and heard. She was evidently accustomed to talk, and\r\neven to listen, if not kept waiting too long for details and\r\nparentheses; she was not continuous, but frequent, as it were, and you\r\ncould see that she hated explanations, though it was not to be supposed\r\nthat she had anything to fear from them. Her favours were general, not\r\nparticular; she was civil enough to every one, but not in any case\r\nendearing, and perfectly genial without being confiding, as people were\r\nin Boston when (in moments of exaltation) they wished to mark that they\r\nwere not suspicious. There was something in her whole manner which\r\nseemed to say to Olive that she belonged to a larger world than hers;\r\nand our young lady was vexed at not hearing that she had lived for a\r\ngood many years in Europe, as this would have made it easy to classify\r\nher as one of the corrupt. She learned, almost with a sense of injury,\r\nthat neither the mother nor the son had been longer beyond the seas than\r\nshe herself; and if they were to be judged as triflers they must be\r\ndealt with individually. Was it an aid to such a judgement to see that\r\nMrs. Burrage was very much pleased with Boston, with Harvard College,\r\nwith her son\'s interior, with her cup of tea (it was old S\xe8vres), which\r\nwas not half so bad as she had expected, with the company he had asked\r\nto meet her (there were three or four gentlemen, one of whom was Mr.\r\nGracie), and, last, not least, with Verena Tarrant, whom she addressed\r\nas a celebrity, kindly, cleverly, but without maternal tenderness or\r\nanything to mark the difference in their age? She spoke to her as if\r\nthey were equals in that respect, as if Verena\'s genius and fame would\r\nmake up the disparity, and the girl had no need of encouragement and\r\npatronage. She made no direct allusion, however, to her particular\r\nviews, and asked her no question about her "gift"--an omission which\r\nVerena thought strange, and, with the most speculative candour, spoke of\r\nto Olive afterwards. Mrs. Burrage seemed to imply that every one present\r\nhad some distinction and some talent, that they were all good company\r\ntogether. There was nothing in her manner to indicate that she was\r\nafraid of Verena on her son\'s account; she didn\'t resemble a person who\r\nwould like him to marry the daughter of a mesmeric healer, and yet she\r\nappeared to think it charming that he should have such a young woman\r\nthere to give gusto to her hour at Cambridge. Poor Olive was, in the\r\nnature of things, entangled in contradictions; she had a horror of the\r\nidea of Verena\'s marrying Mr. Burrage, and yet she was angry when his\r\nmother demeaned herself as if the little girl with red hair, whose\r\nfreshness she enjoyed, could not be a serious danger. She saw all this\r\nthrough the blur of her shyness, the conscious, anxious silence to which\r\nshe was so much of the time condemned. It may therefore be imagined how\r\nsharp her vision would have been could she only have taken the situation\r\nmore simply; for she was intelligent enough not to have needed to be\r\nmorbid, even for purposes of self-defence.\r\n\r\nI must add, however, that there was a moment when she came near being\r\nhappy--or, at any rate, reflected that it was a pity she could not be\r\nso. Mrs. Burrage asked her son to play "some little thing," and he sat\r\ndown to his piano and revealed a talent that might well have gratified\r\nthat lady\'s pride. Olive was extremely susceptible to music, and it was\r\nimpossible to her not to be soothed and beguiled by the young man\'s\r\ncharming art. One "little thing" succeeded another; his selections were\r\nall very happy. His guests sat scattered in the red firelight,\r\nlistening, silent, in comfortable attitudes; there was a faint fragrance\r\nfrom the burning logs, which mingled with the perfume of Schubert and\r\nMendelssohn; the covered lamps made a glow here and there, and the\r\ncabinets and brackets produced brown shadows, out of which some precious\r\nobject gleamed--some ivory carving or cinque-cento cup. It was given to\r\nOlive, under these circumstances, for half an hour, to surrender\r\nherself, to enjoy the music, to admit that Mr. Burrage played with\r\nexquisite taste, to feel as if the situation were a kind of truce. Her\r\nnerves were calmed, her problems--for the time--subsided. Civilisation,\r\nunder such an influence, in such a setting, appeared to have done its\r\nwork; harmony ruled the scene; human life ceased to be a battle. She\r\nwent so far as to ask herself why one should have a quarrel with it; the\r\nrelations of men and women, in that picturesque grouping, had not the\r\nair of being internecine. In short, she had an interval of unexpected\r\nrest, during which she kept her eyes mainly on Verena, who sat near Mrs.\r\nBurrage, letting herself go, evidently, more completely than Olive. To\r\nher, too, music was a delight, and her listening face turned itself to\r\ndifferent parts of the room, unconsciously, while her eyes vaguely\r\nrested on the _bibelots_ that emerged into the firelight. At moments\r\nMrs. Burrage bent her countenance upon her and smiled, at random,\r\nkindly; and then Verena smiled back, while her expression seemed to say\r\nthat, oh yes, she was giving up everything, all principles, all\r\nprojects. Even before it was time to go, Olive felt that they were both\r\n(Verena and she) quite demoralised, and she only summoned energy to take\r\nher companion away when she heard Mrs. Burrage propose to her to come\r\nand spend a fortnight in New York. Then Olive exclaimed to herself, "Is\r\nit a plot? Why in the world can\'t they let her alone?" and prepared to\r\nthrow a fold of her mantle, as she had done before, over her young\r\nfriend. Verena answered, somewhat impetuously, that she should be\r\ndelighted to visit Mrs. Burrage; then checked her impetuosity, after a\r\nglance from Olive, by adding that perhaps this lady wouldn\'t ask her if\r\nshe knew what strong ground she took on the emancipation of women. Mrs.\r\nBurrage looked at her son and laughed; she said she was perfectly aware\r\nof Verena\'s views, and that it was impossible to be more in sympathy\r\nwith them than she herself. She took the greatest interest in the\r\nemancipation of women; she thought there was so much to be done. These\r\nwere the only remarks that passed in reference to the great subject; and\r\nnothing more was said to Verena, either by Henry Burrage or by his\r\nfriend Gracie, about her addressing the Harvard students. Verena had\r\ntold her father that Olive had put her veto upon that, and Tarrant had\r\nsaid to the young men that it seemed as if Miss Chancellor was going to\r\nput the thing through in her own way. We know that he thought this way\r\nvery circuitous; but Miss Chancellor made him feel that she was in\r\nearnest, and that idea frightened the resistance out of him--it had such\r\nterrible associations. The people he had ever seen who were most in\r\nearnest were a committee of gentlemen who had investigated the phenomena\r\nof the "materialisation" of spirits, some ten years before, and had bent\r\nthe fierce light of the scientific method upon him. To Olive it appeared\r\nthat Mr. Burrage and Mr. Gracie had ceased to be jocular; but that did\r\nnot make them any less cynical. Henry Burrage said to Verena, as she was\r\ngoing, that he hoped she would think seriously of his mother\'s\r\ninvitation; and she replied that she didn\'t know whether she should have\r\nmuch time in the future to give to people who already approved of her\r\nviews: she expected to have her hands full with the others, who didn\'t.\r\n\r\n"Does your scheme of work exclude all distraction, all recreation,\r\nthen?" the young man inquired; and his look expressed real suspense.\r\n\r\nVerena referred the matter, as usual, with her air of bright, ungrudging\r\ndeference, to her companion. "Does it, should you say--our scheme of\r\nwork?"\r\n\r\n"I am afraid the distraction we have had this afternoon must last us for\r\na long time," Olive said, without harshness, but with considerable\r\nmajesty.\r\n\r\n"Well, now, _is_ he to be respected?" Verena demanded, as the two young\r\nwomen took their way through the early darkness, pacing quietly side by\r\nside, in their winter-robes, like women consecrated to some holy office.\r\n\r\nOlive turned it over a moment. "Yes, very much--as a pianist!"\r\n\r\nVerena went into town with her in the horse-car--she was staying in\r\nCharles Street for a few days--and that evening she startled Olive by\r\nbreaking out into a reflexion very similar to the whimsical falterings\r\nof which she herself had been conscious while they sat in Mr. Burrage\'s\r\npretty rooms, but against which she had now violently reacted.\r\n\r\n"It would be very nice to do that always--just to take men as they are,\r\nand not to have to think about their badness. It would be very nice not\r\nto have so many questions, but to think they were all comfortably\r\nanswered, so that one could sit there on an old Spanish leather chair,\r\nwith the curtains drawn and keeping out the cold, the darkness, all the\r\nbig, terrible, cruel world--sit there and listen for ever to Schubert\r\nand Mendelssohn. _They_ didn\'t care anything about female suffrage! And\r\nI didn\'t feel the want of a vote to-day at all, did you?" Verena\r\ninquired, ending, as she always ended in these few speculations, with an\r\nappeal to Olive.\r\n\r\nThis young lady thought it necessary to give her a very firm answer. "I\r\nalways feel it--everywhere--night and day. I feel it _here_"; and Olive\r\nlaid her hand solemnly on her heart. "I feel it as a deep, unforgettable\r\nwrong; I feel it as one feels a stain that is on one\'s honour."\r\n\r\nVerena gave a clear laugh, and after that a soft sigh, and then said,\r\n"Do you know, Olive, I sometimes wonder whether, if it wasn\'t for you, I\r\nshould feel it so very much!"\r\n\r\n"My own friend," Olive replied, "you have never yet said anything to me\r\nwhich expressed so clearly the closeness and sanctity of our union."\r\n\r\n"You do keep me up," Verena went on. "You are my conscience."\r\n\r\n"I should like to be able to say that you are my form--my envelope. But\r\nyou are too beautiful for that!" So Olive returned her friend\'s\r\ncompliment; and later she said that, of course, it would be far easier\r\nto give up everything and draw the curtains to and pass one\'s life in an\r\nartificial atmosphere, with rose-coloured lamps. It would be far easier\r\nto abandon the struggle, to leave all the unhappy women of the world to\r\ntheir immemorial misery, to lay down one\'s burden, close one\'s eyes to\r\nthe whole dark picture, and, in short, simply expire. To this Verena\r\nobjected that it would not be easy for her to expire at all; that such\r\nan idea was darker than anything the world contained; that she had not\r\ndone with life yet, and that she didn\'t mean to allow her\r\nresponsibilities to crush her. And then the two young women concluded,\r\nas they had concluded before, by finding themselves completely,\r\ninspiringly in agreement, full of the purpose to live indeed, and with\r\nhigh success; to become great, in order not to be obscure, and powerful,\r\nin order not to be useless. Olive had often declared before that her\r\nconception of life was as something sublime or as nothing at all. The\r\nworld was full of evil, but she was glad to have been born before it had\r\nbeen swept away, while it was still there to face, to give one a task\r\nand a reward. When the great reforms should be consummated, when the day\r\nof justice should have dawned, would not life perhaps be rather poor and\r\npale? She had never pretended to deny that the hope of fame, of the very\r\nhighest distinction, was one of her strongest incitements; and she held\r\nthat the most effective way of protesting against the state of bondage\r\nof women was for an individual member of the sex to become illustrious.\r\nA person who might have overheard some of the talk of this possibly\r\ninfatuated pair would have been touched by their extreme familiarity\r\nwith the idea of earthly glory. Verena had not invented it, but she had\r\ntaken it eagerly from her friend, and she returned it with interest. To\r\nOlive it appeared that just this partnership of their two minds--each of\r\nthem, by itself, lacking an important group of facets--made an organic\r\nwhole which, for the work in hand, could not fail to be brilliantly\r\neffective. Verena was often far more irresponsive than she liked to see\r\nher; but the happy thing in her composition was that, after a short\r\ncontact with the divine idea--Olive was always trying to flash it at\r\nher, like a jewel in an uncovered case--she kindled, flamed up, took the\r\nwords from her friend\'s less persuasive lips, resolved herself into a\r\nmagical voice, became again the pure young sibyl. Then Olive perceived\r\nhow fatally, without Verena\'s tender notes, her crusade would lack\r\nsweetness, what the Catholics call unction; and, on the other hand, how\r\nweak Verena would be on the statistical and logical side if she herself\r\nshould not bring up the rear. Together, in short, they would be\r\ncomplete, they would have everything, and together they would triumph.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX\r\n\r\n\r\nThis idea of their triumph, a triumph as yet ultimate and remote, but\r\npreceded by the solemn vista of an effort so religious as never to be\r\nwanting in ecstasy, became tremendously familiar to the two friends, but\r\nespecially to Olive, during the winter of 187-, a season which ushered\r\nin the most momentous period of Miss Chancellor\'s life. About Christmas\r\na step was taken which advanced her affairs immensely, and put them, to\r\nher apprehension, on a regular footing. This consisted in Verena\'s\r\ncoming in to Charles Street to stay with her, in pursuance of an\r\narrangement on Olive\'s part with Selah Tarrant and his wife that she\r\nshould remain for many months. The coast was now perfectly clear. Mrs.\r\nFarrinder had started on her annual grand tour; she was rousing the\r\npeople, from Maine to Texas; Matthias Pardon (it was to be supposed) had\r\nreceived, temporarily at least, his quietus; and Mrs. Luna was\r\nestablished in New York, where she had taken a house for a year, and\r\nwhence she wrote to her sister that she was going to engage Basil Ransom\r\n(with whom she was in communication for this purpose) to do her\r\nlaw-business. Olive wondered what law-business Adeline could have, and\r\nhoped she would get into a pickle with her landlord or her milliner, so\r\nthat repeated interviews with Mr. Ransom might become necessary. Mrs.\r\nLuna let her know very soon that these interviews had begun; the young\r\nMississippian had come to dine with her; he hadn\'t got started much, by\r\nwhat she could make out, and she was even afraid that he didn\'t dine\r\nevery day. But he wore a tall hat now, like a Northern gentleman, and\r\nAdeline intimated that she found him really attractive. He had been very\r\nnice to Newton, told him all about the war (quite the Southern version,\r\nof course, but Mrs. Luna didn\'t care anything about American politics,\r\nand she wanted her son to know all sides), and Newton did nothing but\r\ntalk about him, calling him "Rannie," and imitating his pronunciation of\r\ncertain words. Adeline subsequently wrote that she had made up her mind\r\nto put her affairs into his hands (Olive sighed, not unmagnanimously, as\r\nshe thought of her sister\'s "affairs"), and later still she mentioned\r\nthat she was thinking strongly of taking him to be Newton\'s tutor. She\r\nwished this interesting child to be privately educated, and it would be\r\nmore agreeable to have in that relation a person who was already, as it\r\nwere, a member of the family. Mrs. Luna wrote as if he were prepared to\r\ngive up his profession to take charge of her son, and Olive was pretty\r\nsure that this was only a part of her grandeur, of the habit she had\r\ncontracted, especially since living in Europe, of speaking as if in\r\nevery case she required special arrangements.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the difference in their age, Olive had long since judged\r\nher, and made up her mind that Adeline lacked every quality that a\r\nperson needed to be interesting in her eyes. She was rich (or\r\nsufficiently so), she was conventional and timid, very fond of\r\nattentions from men (with whom indeed she was reputed bold, but Olive\r\nscorned such boldness as that), given up to a merely personal,\r\negotistical, instinctive life, and as unconscious of the tendencies of\r\nthe age, the revenges of the future, the new truths and the great social\r\nquestions, as if she had been a mere bundle of dress-trimmings, which\r\nshe very nearly was. It was perfectly observable that she had no\r\nconscience, and it irritated Olive deeply to see how much trouble a\r\nwoman was spared when she was constructed on that system. Adeline\'s\r\n"affairs," as I have intimated, her social relations, her views of\r\nNewton\'s education, her practice and her theory (for she had plenty of\r\nthat, such as it was, heaven save the mark!), her spasmodic disposition\r\nto marry again, and her still sillier retreats in the presence of danger\r\n(for she had not even the courage of her frivolity), these things had\r\nbeen a subject of tragic consideration to Olive ever since the return of\r\nthe elder sister to America. The tragedy was not in any particular harm\r\nthat Mrs. Luna could do her (for she did her good, rather, that is, she\r\ndid her honour by laughing at her), but in the spectacle itself, the\r\ndrama, guided by the hand of fate, of which the small, ignoble scenes\r\nunrolled themselves so logically. The _d\xe9nouement_ would of course be in\r\nkeeping, and would consist simply of the spiritual death of Mrs. Luna,\r\nwho would end by understanding no common speech of Olive\'s at all, and\r\nwould sink into mere worldly plumpness, into the last complacency, the\r\nsupreme imbecility, of petty, genteel conservatism. As for Newton, he\r\nwould be more utterly odious, if possible, as he grew up, than he was\r\nalready; in fact, he would not grow up at all, but only grow down, if\r\nhis mother should continue her infatuated system with him. He was\r\ninsufferably forward and selfish; under the pretext of keeping him, at\r\nany cost, refined, Adeline had coddled and caressed him, having him\r\nalways in her petticoats, remitting his lessons when he pretended he had\r\nan earache, drawing him into the conversation, letting him answer her\r\nback, with an impertinence beyond his years, when she administered the\r\nsmallest check. The place for him, in Olive\'s eyes, was one of the\r\npublic schools, where the children of the people would teach him his\r\nsmall importance, teach it, if necessary, by the aid of an occasional\r\ndrubbing; and the two ladies had a grand discussion on this point before\r\nMrs. Luna left Boston--a scene which ended in Adeline\'s clutching the\r\nirrepressible Newton to her bosom (he came in at the moment), and\r\ndemanding of him a vow that he would live and die in the principles of\r\nhis mother. Mrs. Luna declared that if she must be trampled upon--and\r\nvery likely it was her fate!--she would rather be trampled upon by men\r\nthan by women, and that if Olive and her friends should get possession\r\nof the government they would be worse despots than those who were\r\ncelebrated in history. Newton took an infant oath that he would never be\r\na destructive, impious radical, and Olive felt that after this she\r\nneedn\'t trouble herself any more about her sister, whom she simply\r\ncommitted to her fate. That fate might very properly be to marry an\r\nenemy of her country, a man who, no doubt, desired to treat women with\r\nthe lash and manacles, as he and his people had formerly treated the\r\nwretched coloured race. If she was so fond of the fine old institutions\r\nof the past, he would supply them to her in abundance; and if she wanted\r\nso much to be a conservative, she could try first how she liked being a\r\nconservative\'s wife. If Olive troubled herself little about Adeline, she\r\ntroubled herself more about Basil Ransom; she said to herself that since\r\nhe hated women who respected themselves (and each other), destiny would\r\nuse him rightly in hanging a person like Adeline round his neck. That\r\nwould be the way poetic justice ought to work, for him--and the law that\r\nour prejudices, when they act themselves out, punish us in doing so.\r\nOlive considered all this, as it was her effort to consider everything,\r\nfrom a very high point of view, and ended by feeling sure it was not for\r\nthe sake of any nervous personal security that she desired to see her\r\ntwo relations in New York get mixed up together. If such an event as\r\ntheir marriage would gratify her sense of fitness, it would be simply as\r\nan illustration of certain laws. Olive, thanks to the philosophic cast\r\nof her mind, was exceedingly fond of illustrations of laws.\r\n\r\nI hardly know, however, what illumination it was that sprang from her\r\nconsciousness (now a source of considerable comfort) that Mrs. Farrinder\r\nwas carrying the war into distant territories, and would return to\r\nBoston only in time to preside at a grand Female Convention, already\r\nadvertised to take place in Boston in the month of June. It was\r\nagreeable to her that this imperial woman should be away; it made the\r\nfield more free, the air more light; it suggested an exemption from\r\nofficial criticism. I have not taken space to mention certain episodes\r\nof the more recent intercourse of these ladies, and must content myself\r\nwith tracing them, lightly, in their consequences. These may be summed\r\nup in the remark, which will doubtless startle no one by its freshness,\r\nthat two imperial women are scarcely more likely to hit it off together,\r\nas the phrase is, than two imperial men. Since that party at Miss\r\nBirdseye\'s, so important in its results for Olive, she had had occasion\r\nto approach Mrs. Farrinder more nearly, and those overtures brought\r\nforth the knowledge that the great leader of the feminine revolution was\r\nthe one person (in that part of the world) more concentrated, more\r\ndetermined, than herself. Miss Chancellor\'s aspirations, of late, had\r\nbeen immensely quickened; she had begun to believe in herself to a\r\nlivelier tune than she had ever listened to before; and she now\r\nperceived that when spirit meets spirit there must either be mutual\r\nabsorption or a sharp concussion. It had long been familiar to her that\r\nshe should have to count with the obstinacy of the world at large, but\r\nshe now discovered that she should have to count also with certain\r\nelements in the feminine camp. This complicated the problem, and such a\r\ncomplication, naturally, could not make Mrs. Farrinder appear more easy\r\nto assimilate. If Olive\'s was a high nature and so was hers, the fault\r\nwas in neither; it was only an admonition that they were not needed as\r\nlandmarks in the same part of the field. If such perceptions are\r\ndelicate as between men, the reader need not be reminded of the\r\nexquisite form they may assume in natures more refined. So it was that\r\nOlive passed, in three months, from the stage of veneration to that of\r\ncompetition; and the process had been accelerated by the introduction of\r\nVerena into the fold. Mrs. Farrinder had behaved in the strangest way\r\nabout Verena. First she had been struck with her, and then she hadn\'t;\r\nfirst she had seemed to want to take her in, then she had shied at her\r\nunmistakably--intimating to Olive that there were enough of that kind\r\nalready. Of "that kind" indeed!--the phrase reverberated in Miss\r\nChancellor\'s resentful soul. Was it possible she didn\'t know the kind\r\nVerena was of, and with what vulgar aspirants to notoriety did she\r\nconfound her? It had been Olive\'s original desire to obtain Mrs.\r\nFarrinder\'s stamp for her _prot\xe9g\xe9e_; she wished her to hold a\r\ncommission from the commander-in-chief. With this view the two young\r\nwomen had made more than one pilgrimage to Roxbury, and on one of these\r\noccasions the sibylline mood (in its most charming form) had descended\r\nupon Verena. She had fallen into it, naturally and gracefully, in the\r\ncourse of talk, and poured out a stream of eloquence even more touching\r\nthan her regular discourse at Miss Birdseye\'s. Mrs. Farrinder had taken\r\nit rather dryly, and certainly it didn\'t resemble her own style of\r\noratory, remarkable and cogent as this was. There had been considerable\r\nquestion of her writing a letter to the New York _Tribune_, the effect\r\nof which should be to launch Miss Tarrant into renown; but this\r\nbeneficent epistle never appeared, and now Olive saw that there was no\r\nfavour to come from the prophetess of Roxbury. There had been\r\nprimnesses, pruderies, small reserves, which ended by staying her pen.\r\nIf Olive didn\'t say at once that she was jealous of Verena\'s more\r\nattractive manner, it was only because such a declaration was destined\r\nto produce more effect a little later. What she did say was that\r\nevidently Mrs. Farrinder wanted to keep the movement in her own\r\nhands--viewed with suspicion certain romantic, esthetic elements which\r\nOlive and Verena seemed to be trying to introduce into it. They insisted\r\nso much, for instance, on the historic unhappiness of women; but Mrs.\r\nFarrinder didn\'t appear to care anything for that, or indeed to know\r\nmuch about history at all. She seemed to begin just to-day, and she\r\ndemanded their rights for them whether they were unhappy or not. The\r\nupshot of this was that Olive threw herself on Verena\'s neck with a\r\nmovement which was half indignation, half rapture; she exclaimed that\r\nthey would have to fight the battle without human help, but, after all,\r\nit was better so. If they were all in all to each other, what more could\r\nthey want? They would be isolated, but they would be free; and this view\r\nof the situation brought with it a feeling that they had almost already\r\nbegun to be a force. It was not, indeed, that Olive\'s resentment faded\r\nquite away; for not only had she the sense, doubtless very presumptuous,\r\nthat Mrs. Farrinder was the only person thereabouts of a stature to\r\njudge her (a sufficient cause of antagonism in itself, for if we like to\r\nbe praised by our betters we prefer that censure should come from the\r\nother sort), but the kind of opinion she had unexpectedly betrayed,\r\nafter implying such esteem in the earlier phase of their intercourse,\r\nmade Olive\'s cheeks occasionally flush. She prayed heaven that _she_\r\nmight never become so personal, so narrow. She was frivolous, worldly,\r\nan amateur, a trifler, a frequenter of Beacon Street; her taking up\r\nVerena Tarrant was only a kind of elderly, ridiculous doll-dressing:\r\nthis was the light in which Miss Chancellor had reason to believe that\r\nit now suited Mrs. Farrinder to regard her! It was fortunate, perhaps,\r\nthat the misrepresentation was so gross; yet, none the less, tears of\r\nwrath rose more than once to Olive\'s eyes when she reflected that this\r\nparticular wrong had been put upon her. Frivolous, worldly, Beacon\r\nStreet! She appealed to Verena to share in her pledge that the world\r\nshould know in due time how much of that sort of thing there was about\r\nher. As I have already hinted, Verena at such moments quite rose to the\r\noccasion; she had private pangs at committing herself to give the cold\r\nshoulder to Beacon Street for ever; but she was now so completely in\r\nOlive\'s hands that there was no sacrifice to which she would not have\r\nconsented in order to prove that her benefactress was not frivolous.\r\n\r\nThe matter of her coming to stay for so long in Charles Street was\r\narranged during a visit that Selah Tarrant paid there at Miss\r\nChancellor\'s request. This interview, which had some curious features,\r\nwould be worth describing but I am forbidden to do more than mention the\r\nmost striking of these. Olive wished to have an understanding with him;\r\nwished the situation to be clear, so that, disagreeable as it would be\r\nto her to receive him, she sent him a summons for a certain hour--an\r\nhour at which she had planned that Verena should be out of the house.\r\nShe withheld this incident from the girl\'s knowledge, reflecting with\r\nsome solemnity that it was the first deception (for Olive her silence\r\nwas a deception) that she had yet practised on her friend, and wondering\r\nwhether she should have to practise others in the future. She then and\r\nthere made up her mind that she would not shrink from others should they\r\nbe necessary. She notified Tarrant that she should keep Verena a long\r\ntime, and Tarrant remarked that it was certainly very pleasant to see\r\nher so happily located. But he also intimated that he should like to\r\nknow what Miss Chancellor laid out to do with her; and the tone of this\r\nsuggestion made Olive feel how right she had been to foresee that their\r\ninterview would have the stamp of business. It assumed that complexion\r\nvery definitely when she crossed over to her desk and wrote Mr. Tarrant\r\na cheque for a very considerable amount. "Leave us alone--entirely\r\nalone--for a year, and then I will write you another": it was with these\r\nwords she handed him the little strip of paper that meant so much,\r\nfeeling, as she did so, that surely Mrs. Farrinder herself could not be\r\nless amateurish than that. Selah looked at the cheque, at Miss\r\nChancellor, at the cheque again, at the ceiling, at the floor, at the\r\nclock, and once more at his hostess; then the document disappeared\r\nbeneath the folds of his waterproof, and she saw that he was putting it\r\ninto some queer place on his queer person. "Well, if I didn\'t believe\r\nyou were going to help her to develop," he remarked; and he stopped,\r\nwhile his hands continued to fumble, out of sight, and he treated Olive\r\nto his large joyless smile. She assured him that he need have no fear on\r\nthat score; Verena\'s development was the thing in the world in which she\r\ntook most interest; she should have every opportunity for a free\r\nexpansion. "Yes, that\'s the great thing," Selah said; "it\'s more\r\nimportant than attracting a crowd. That\'s all we shall ask of you; let\r\nher act out her nature. Don\'t all the trouble of humanity come from our\r\nbeing pressed back? Don\'t shut down the cover, Miss Chancellor; just let\r\nher overflow!" And again Tarrant illuminated his inquiry, his metaphor,\r\nby the strange and silent lateral movement of his jaws. He added,\r\npresently, that he supposed he should have to fix it with Mis\' Tarrant;\r\nbut Olive made no answer to that; she only looked at him with a face in\r\nwhich she intended to express that there was nothing that need detain\r\nhim longer. She knew it had been fixed with Mrs. Tarrant; she had been\r\nover all that with Verena, who had told her that her mother was willing\r\nto sacrifice her for her highest good. She had reason to know (not\r\nthrough Verena, of course) that Mrs. Tarrant had embraced, tenderly, the\r\nidea of a pecuniary compensation, and there was no fear of her making a\r\nscene when Tarrant should come back with a cheque in his pocket. "Well,\r\nI trust she _may_ develop, richly, and that you may accomplish what you\r\ndesire; it seems as if we had only a little way to go further," that\r\nworthy observed, as he erected himself for departure.\r\n\r\n"It\'s not a little way; it\'s a very long way," Olive replied, rather\r\nsternly.\r\n\r\nTarrant was on the threshold; he lingered a little, embarrassed by her\r\ngrimness, for he himself had always inclined to rose-coloured views of\r\nprogress, of the march of truth. He had never met any one so much in\r\nearnest as this definite, literal young woman, who had taken such an\r\nunhoped-for fancy to his daughter; whose longing for the new day had\r\nsuch perversities of pessimism, and who, in the midst of something that\r\nappeared to be terribly searching in her honesty, was willing to corrupt\r\nhim, as a father, with the most extravagant orders on her bank. He\r\nhardly knew in what language to speak to her; it seemed as if there was\r\nnothing soothing enough, when a lady adopted that tone about a movement\r\nwhich was thought by some of the brightest to be so promising. "Oh,\r\nwell, I guess there\'s some kind of mysterious law...." he murmured,\r\nalmost timidly; and so he passed from Miss Chancellor\'s sight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX\r\n\r\n\r\nShe hoped she should not soon see him again, and there appeared to be no\r\nreason she should, if their intercourse was to be conducted by means of\r\ncheques. The understanding with Verena was, of course, complete; she had\r\npromised to stay with her friend as long as her friend should require\r\nit. She had said at first that she couldn\'t give up her mother, but she\r\nhad been made to feel that there was no question of giving up. She\r\nshould be as free as air, to go and come; she could spend hours and days\r\nwith her mother, whenever Mrs. Tarrant required her attention; all that\r\nOlive asked of her was that, for the time, she should regard Charles\r\nStreet as her home. There was no struggle about this, for the simple\r\nreason that by the time the question came to the front Verena was\r\ncompletely under the charm. The idea of Olive\'s charm will perhaps make\r\nthe reader smile; but I use the word not in its derived, but in its\r\nliteral sense. The fine web of authority, of dependence, that her\r\nstrenuous companion had woven about her, was now as dense as a suit of\r\ngolden mail; and Verena was thoroughly interested in their great\r\nundertaking; she saw it in the light of an active, enthusiastic faith.\r\nThe benefit that her father desired for her was now assured; she\r\nexpanded, developed, on the most liberal scale. Olive saw the\r\ndifference, and you may imagine how she rejoiced in it; she had never\r\nknown a greater pleasure. Verena\'s former attitude had been girlish\r\nsubmission, grateful, curious sympathy. She had given herself, in her\r\nyoung, amused surprise, because Olive\'s stronger will and the incisive\r\nproceedings with which she pointed her purpose drew her on. Besides, she\r\nwas held by hospitality, the vision of new social horizons, the sense of\r\nnovelty, and the love of change. But now the girl was disinterestedly\r\nattached to the precious things they were to do together; she cared\r\nabout them for themselves, believed in them ardently, had them\r\nconstantly in mind. Her share in the union of the two young women was no\r\nlonger passive, purely appreciative; it was passionate, too, and it put\r\nforth a beautiful energy. If Olive desired to get Verena into training,\r\nshe could flatter herself that the process had already begun, and that\r\nher colleague enjoyed it almost as much as she. Therefore she could say\r\nto herself, without the imputation of heartlessness, that when she left\r\nher mother it was for a noble, a sacred use. In point of fact, she left\r\nher very little, and she spent hours in jingling, aching, jostled\r\njourneys between Charles Street and the stale suburban cottage. Mrs.\r\nTarrant sighed and grimaced, wrapped herself more than ever in her\r\nmantle, said she didn\'t know as she was fit to struggle alone, and that,\r\nhalf the time, if Verena was away, she wouldn\'t have the nerve to answer\r\nthe door-bell; she was incapable, of course, of neglecting such an\r\nopportunity to posture as one who paid with her heart\'s blood for\r\nleading the van of human progress. But Verena had an inner sense (she\r\njudged her mother now, a little, for the first time) that she would be\r\nsorry to be taken at her word, and that she felt safe enough in trusting\r\nto her daughter\'s generosity. She could not divest herself of the\r\nfaith--even now that Mrs. Luna was gone, leaving no trace, and the grey\r\nwalls of a sedentary winter were apparently closing about the two young\r\nwomen--she could not renounce the theory that a residence in Charles\r\nStreet must at least produce some contact with the brilliant classes.\r\nShe was vexed at her daughter\'s resignation to not going to parties and\r\nto Miss Chancellor\'s not giving them; but it was nothing new for her to\r\nhave to practise patience, and she could feel, at least, that it was\r\njust as handy for Mr. Burrage to call on the child in town, where he\r\nspent half his time, sleeping constantly at Parker\'s.\r\n\r\nIt was a fact that this fortunate youth called very often, and Verena\r\nsaw him with Olive\'s full concurrence whenever she was at home. It had\r\nnow been quite agreed between them that no artificial limits should be\r\nset to the famous phase; and Olive had, while it lasted, a sense of real\r\nheroism in steeling herself against uneasiness. It seemed to her,\r\nmoreover, only justice that she should make some concession; if Verena\r\nmade a great sacrifice of filial duty in coming to live with her (this,\r\nof course, should be permanent--she would buy off the Tarrants from year\r\nto year), she must not incur the imputation (the world would judge her,\r\nin that case, ferociously) of keeping her from forming common social\r\nties. The friendship of a young man and a young woman was, according to\r\nthe pure code of New England, a common social tie; and as the weeks\r\nelapsed Miss Chancellor saw no reason to repent of her temerity. Verena\r\nwas not falling in love; she felt that she should know it, should guess\r\nit on the spot. Verena was fond of human intercourse; she was\r\nessentially a sociable creature; she liked to shine and smile and talk\r\nand listen; and so far as Henry Burrage was concerned he introduced an\r\nelement of easy and convenient relaxation into a life now a good deal\r\nstiffened (Olive was perfectly willing to own it) by great civic\r\npurposes. But the girl was being saved, without interference, by the\r\nsimple operation of her interest in those very designs. From this time\r\nthere was no need of putting pressure on her; her own springs were\r\nworking; the fire with which she glowed came from within. Sacredly,\r\nbrightly single she would remain; her only espousals would be at the\r\naltar of a great cause. Olive always absented herself when Mr. Burrage\r\nwas announced; and when Verena afterwards attempted to give some account\r\nof his conversation she checked her, said she would rather know nothing\r\nabout it--all with a very solemn mildness; this made her feel very\r\nsuperior, truly noble. She knew by this time (I scarcely can tell how,\r\nsince Verena could give her no report) exactly what sort of a youth Mr.\r\nBurrage was: he was weakly pretentious, softly original, cultivated\r\neccentricity, patronised progress, liked to have mysteries, sudden\r\nappointments to keep, anonymous persons to visit, the air of leading a\r\ndouble life, of being devoted to a girl whom people didn\'t know, or at\r\nleast didn\'t meet. Of course he liked to make an impression on Verena;\r\nbut what he mainly liked was to play her off upon the other girls, the\r\ndaughters of fashion, with whom he danced at Papanti\'s. Such were the\r\nimages that proceeded from Olive\'s rich moral consciousness. "Well, he\r\n_is_ greatly interested in our movement": so much Verena once managed to\r\nannounce; but the words rather irritated Miss Chancellor, who, as we\r\nknow, did not care to allow for accidental exceptions in the great\r\nmasculine conspiracy.\r\n\r\nIn the month of March Verena told her that Mr. Burrage was offering\r\nmatrimony--offering it with much insistence, begging that she would at\r\nleast wait and think of it before giving him a final answer. Verena was\r\nevidently very glad to be able to say to Olive that she had assured him\r\nshe couldn\'t think of it, and that if he expected this he had better not\r\ncome any more. He continued to come, and it was therefore to be supposed\r\nthat he had ceased to count on such a concession; it was now Olive\'s\r\nopinion that he really didn\'t desire it. She had a theory that he\r\nproposed to almost any girl who was not likely to accept him--did it\r\nbecause he was making a collection of such episodes--a mental album of\r\ndeclarations, blushes, hesitations, refusals that just missed imposing\r\nthemselves as acceptances, quite as he collected enamels and Cremona\r\nviolins. He would be very sorry indeed to ally himself to the house of\r\nTarrant; but such a fear didn\'t prevent him from holding it becoming in\r\na man of taste to give that encouragement to low-born girls who were\r\npretty, for one looked out for the special cases in which, for reasons\r\n(even the lowest might have reasons), they wouldn\'t "rise." "I told you\r\nI wouldn\'t marry him, and I won\'t," Verena said, delightedly, to her\r\nfriend; her tone suggested that a certain credit belonged to her for the\r\nway she carried out her assurance. "I never thought you would, if you\r\ndidn\'t want to," Olive replied to this; and Verena could have no\r\nrejoinder but the good-humour that sat in her eyes, unable as she was to\r\nsay that she had wanted to. They had a little discussion, however, when\r\nshe intimated that she pitied him for his discomfiture, Olive\'s\r\ncontention being that, selfish, conceited, pampered and insincere, he\r\nmight properly be left now to digest his affront. Miss Chancellor felt\r\nnone of the remorse now that she would have felt six months before at\r\nstanding in the way of such a chance for Verena, and she would have been\r\nvery angry if any one had asked her if she were not afraid of taking too\r\nmuch upon herself. She would have said, moreover, that she stood in no\r\none\'s way, and that even if she were not there Verena would never think\r\nseriously of a frivolous little man who fiddled while Rome was burning.\r\nThis did not prevent Olive from making up her mind that they had better\r\ngo to Europe in the spring; a year\'s residence in that quarter of the\r\nglobe would be highly agreeable to Verena, and might even contribute to\r\nthe evolution of her genius. It cost Miss Chancellor an effort to admit\r\nthat any virtue still lingered in the elder world, and that it could\r\nhave any important lesson for two such good Americans as her friend and\r\nherself; but it suited her just then to make this assumption, which was\r\nnot altogether sincere. It was recommended by the idea that it would get\r\nher companion out of the way--out of the way of officious\r\nfellow-citizens--till she should be absolutely firm on her feet, and\r\nwould also give greater intensity to their own long conversation. On\r\nthat continent of strangers they would cleave more closely still to each\r\nother. This, of course, would be to fly before the inevitable "phase,"\r\nmuch more than to face it; but Olive decided that if they should reach\r\nunscathed the term of their delay (the first of July) she should have\r\nfaced it as much as either justice or generosity demanded. I may as well\r\nsay at once that she traversed most of this period without further\r\nserious alarms and with a great many little thrills of bliss and hope.\r\n\r\nNothing happened to dissipate the good omens with which her partnership\r\nwith Verena Tarrant was at present surrounded. They threw themselves\r\ninto study; they had innumerable big books from the Athen\xe6um, and\r\nconsumed the midnight oil. Henry Burrage, after Verena had shaken her\r\nhead at him so sweetly and sadly, returned to New York, giving no sign;\r\nthey only heard that he had taken refuge under the ruffled maternal\r\nwing. (Olive, at least, took for granted the wing was ruffled; she could\r\nfancy how Mrs. Burrage would be affected by the knowledge that her son\r\nhad been refused by the daughter of a mesmeric healer. She would be\r\nalmost as angry as if she had learnt that he had been accepted.)\r\nMatthias Pardon had not yet taken his revenge in the newspapers; he was\r\nperhaps nursing his thunderbolts; at any rate, now that the operatic\r\nseason had begun, he was much occupied in interviewing the principal\r\nsingers, one of whom he described in one of the leading journals (Olive,\r\nat least, was sure it was only he who could write like that) as "a dear\r\nlittle woman with baby dimples and kittenish movements." The Tarrants\r\nwere apparently given up to a measure of sensual ease with which they\r\nhad not hitherto been familiar, thanks to the increase of income that\r\nthey drew from their eccentric protectress. Mrs. Tarrant now enjoyed the\r\nministrations of a "girl"; it was partly her pride (at any rate, she\r\nchose to give it this turn) that her house had for many years been\r\nconducted without the element--so debasing on both sides--of servile,\r\nmercenary labour. She wrote to Olive (she was perpetually writing to her\r\nnow, but Olive never answered) that she was conscious of having fallen\r\nto a lower plane, but she admitted that it was a prop to her wasted\r\nspirit to have some one to converse with when Selah was off. Verena, of\r\ncourse, perceived the difference, which was inadequately explained by\r\nthe theory of a sudden increase of her father\'s practice (nothing of her\r\nfather\'s had ever increased like that), and ended by guessing the cause\r\nof it--a discovery which did not in the least disturb her equanimity.\r\nShe accepted the idea that her parents should receive a pecuniary\r\ntribute from the extraordinary friend whom she had encountered on the\r\nthreshold of womanhood, just as she herself accepted that friend\'s\r\nirresistible hospitality. She had no worldly pride, no traditions of\r\nindependence, no ideas of what was done and what was not done; but there\r\nwas only one thing that equalled this perfectly gentle and natural\r\ninsensibility to favours--namely, the inveteracy of her habit of not\r\nasking them. Olive had had an apprehension that she would flush a little\r\nat learning the terms on which they should now be able to pursue their\r\ncareer together; but Verena never changed colour; it was either not new\r\nor not disagreeable to her that the authors of her being should be\r\nbought off, silenced by money, treated as the troublesome of the lower\r\norders are treated when they are not locked up; so that her friend had a\r\nperception, after this, that it would probably be impossible in any way\r\never to offend her. She was too rancourless, too detached from\r\nconventional standards, too free from private self-reference. It was too\r\nmuch to say of her that she forgave injuries, since she was not\r\nconscious of them; there was in forgiveness a certain arrogance of which\r\nshe was incapable, and her bright mildness glided over the many traps\r\nthat life sets for our consistency. Olive had always held that pride was\r\nnecessary to character, but there was no peculiarity of Verena\'s that\r\ncould make her spirit seem less pure. The added luxuries in the little\r\nhouse at Cambridge, which even with their help was still such a penal\r\nsettlement, made her feel afresh that before she came to the rescue the\r\ndaughter of that house had traversed a desert of sordid misery. She had\r\ncooked and washed and swept and stitched; she had worked harder than any\r\nof Miss Chancellor\'s servants. These things had left no trace upon her\r\nperson or her mind; everything fresh and fair renewed itself in her with\r\nextraordinary facility, everything ugly and tiresome evaporated as soon\r\nas it touched her; but Olive deemed that, being what she was, she had a\r\nright to immense compensations. In the future she should have exceeding\r\nluxury and ease, and Miss Chancellor had no difficulty in persuading\r\nherself that persons doing the high intellectual and moral work to which\r\nthe two young ladies in Charles Street were now committed owed it to\r\nthemselves, owed it to the groaning sisterhood, to cultivate the best\r\nmaterial conditions. She herself was nothing of a sybarite, and she had\r\nproved, visiting the alleys and slums of Boston in the service of the\r\nAssociated Charities, that there was no foulness of disease or misery\r\nshe feared to look in the face; but her house had always been thoroughly\r\nwell regulated, she was passionately clean, and she was an excellent\r\nwoman of business. Now, however, she elevated daintiness to a religion;\r\nher interior shone with superfluous friction, with punctuality, with\r\nwinter roses. Among these soft influences Verena herself bloomed like\r\nthe flower that attains such perfection in Boston. Olive had always\r\nrated high the native refinement of her country-women, their latent\r\n"adaptability," their talent for accommodating themselves at a glance to\r\nchanged conditions; but the way her companion rose with the level of the\r\ncivilisation that surrounded her, the way she assimilated all delicacies\r\nand absorbed all traditions, left this friendly theory halting behind.\r\nThe winter days were still, indoors, in Charles Street, and the winter\r\nnights secure from interruption. Our two young women had plenty of\r\nduties, but Olive had never favoured the custom of running in and out.\r\nMuch conference on social and reformatory topics went forward under her\r\nroof, and she received her colleagues--she belonged to twenty\r\nassociations and committees--only at pre-appointed hours, which she\r\nexpected them to observe rigidly. Verena\'s share in these proceedings\r\nwas not active; she hovered over them, smiling, listening, dropping\r\noccasionally a fanciful though never an idle word, like some gently\r\nanimated image placed there for good omen. It was understood that her\r\npart was before the scenes, not behind; that she was not a prompter, but\r\n(potentially, at least) a "popular favourite," and that the work over\r\nwhich Miss Chancellor presided so efficiently was a general preparation\r\nof the platform on which, later, her companion would execute the most\r\nstriking steps.\r\n\r\nThe western windows of Olive\'s drawing-room, looking over the water,\r\ntook in the red sunsets of winter; the long, low bridge that crawled, on\r\nits staggering posts, across the Charles; the casual patches of ice and\r\nsnow; the desolate suburban horizons, peeled and made bald by the rigour\r\nof the season; the general hard, cold void of the prospect; the\r\nextrusion, at Charlestown, at Cambridge, of a few chimneys and steeples,\r\nstraight, sordid tubes of factories and engine-shops, or spare,\r\nheavenward finger of the New England meeting-house. There was something\r\ninexorable in the poverty of the scene, shameful in the meanness of its\r\ndetails, which gave a collective impression of boards and tin and frozen\r\nearth, sheds and rotting piles, railway-lines striding flat across a\r\nthoroughfare of puddles, and tracks of the humbler, the universal\r\nhorse-car, traversing obliquely this path of danger; loose fences,\r\nvacant lots, mounds of refuse, yards bestrewn with iron pipes, telegraph\r\npoles, and bare wooden backs of places. Verena thought such a view\r\nlovely, and she was by no means without excuse when, as the afternoon\r\nclosed, the ugly picture was tinted with a clear, cold rosiness. The\r\nair, in its windless chill, seemed to tinkle like a crystal, the\r\nfaintest gradations of tone were perceptible in the sky, the west became\r\ndeep and delicate, everything grew doubly distinct before taking on the\r\ndimness of evening. There were pink flushes on snow, "tender" reflexions\r\nin patches of stiffened marsh, sounds of car-bells, no longer vulgar,\r\nbut almost silvery, on the long bridge, lonely outlines of distant dusky\r\nundulations against the fading glow. These agreeable effects used to\r\nlight up that end of the drawing-room, and Olive often sat at the window\r\nwith her companion before it was time for the lamp. They admired the\r\nsunsets, they rejoiced in the ruddy spots projected upon the\r\nparlour-wall, they followed the darkening perspective in fanciful\r\nexcursions. They watched the stellar points come out at last in a colder\r\nheaven, and then, shuddering a little, arm in arm, they turned away,\r\nwith a sense that the winter night was even more cruel than the tyranny\r\nof men--turned back to drawn curtains and a brighter fire and a\r\nglittering tea-tray and more and more talk about the long martyrdom of\r\nwomen, a subject as to which Olive was inexhaustible and really most\r\ninteresting. There were some nights of deep snowfall, when Charles\r\nStreet was white and muffled and the door-bell foredoomed to silence,\r\nwhich seemed little islands of lamp-light, of enlarged and intensified\r\nvision. They read a great deal of history together, and read it ever\r\nwith the same thought--that of finding confirmation in it for this idea\r\nthat their sex had suffered inexpressibly, and that at any moment in the\r\ncourse of human affairs the state of the world would have been so much\r\nless horrible (history seemed to them in every way horrible) if women\r\nhad been able to press down the scale. Verena was full of suggestions\r\nwhich stimulated discussions; it was she, oftenest, who kept in view the\r\nfact that a good many women in the past had been entrusted with power\r\nand had not always used it amiably, who brought up the wicked queens,\r\nthe profligate mistresses of kings. These ladies were easily disposed of\r\nbetween the two, and the public crimes of Bloody Mary, the private\r\nmisdemeanours of Faustina, wife of the pure Marcus Aurelius, were very\r\nsatisfactorily classified. If the influence of women in the past\r\naccounted for every act of virtue that men had happened to achieve, it\r\nonly made the matter balance properly that the influence of men should\r\nexplain the casual irregularities of the other sex. Olive could see how\r\nfew books had passed through Verena\'s hands, and how little the home of\r\nthe Tarrants had been a house of reading; but the girl now traversed the\r\nfields of literature with her characteristic lightness of step.\r\nEverything she turned to or took up became an illustration of the\r\nfacility, the "giftedness," which Olive, who had so little of it, never\r\nceased to wonder at and prize. Nothing frightened her; she always smiled\r\nat it, she could do anything she tried. As she knew how to do other\r\nthings, she knew how to study; she read quickly and remembered\r\ninfallibly; could repeat, days afterward, passages that she appeared\r\nonly to have glanced at. Olive, of course, was more and more happy to\r\nthink that their cause should have the services of an organisation so\r\nrare.\r\n\r\nAll this doubtless sounds rather dry, and I hasten to add that our\r\nfriends were not always shut up in Miss Chancellor\'s strenuous parlour.\r\nIn spite of Olive\'s desire to keep her precious inmate to herself and to\r\nbend her attention upon their common studies, in spite of her constantly\r\nreminding Verena that this winter was to be purely educative and that\r\nthe platitudes of the satisfied and unregenerate would have little to\r\nteach her, in spite, in short, of the severe and constant duality of our\r\nyoung women, it must not be supposed that their life had not many\r\npersonal confluents and tributaries. Individual and original as Miss\r\nChancellor was universally acknowledged to be, she was yet a typical\r\nBostonian, and as a typical Bostonian she could not fail to belong in\r\nsome degree to a "set." It had been said of her that she was in it but\r\nnot of it; but she was of it enough to go occasionally into other houses\r\nand to receive their occupants in her own. It was her belief that she\r\nfilled her tea-pot with the spoon of hospitality, and made a good many\r\nselect spirits feel that they were welcome under her roof at convenient\r\nhours. She had a preference for what she called _real_ people, and there\r\nwere several whose reality she had tested by arts known to herself. This\r\nlittle society was rather suburban and miscellaneous; it was prolific in\r\nladies who trotted about, early and late, with books from the Athen\xe6um\r\nnursed behind their muff, or little nosegays of exquisite flowers that\r\nthey were carrying as presents to each other. Verena, who, when Olive\r\nwas not with her, indulged in a good deal of desultory contemplation at\r\nthe window, saw them pass the house in Charles Street, always apparently\r\nstraining a little, as if they might be too late for something. At\r\nalmost any time, for she envied their preoccupation, she would have\r\ntaken the chance with them. Very often, when she described them to her\r\nmother, Mrs. Tarrant didn\'t know who they were; there were even days\r\n(she had so many discouragements) when it seemed as if she didn\'t want\r\nto know. So long as they were not some one else, it seemed to be no use\r\nthat they were themselves; whoever they were, they were sure to have\r\nthat defect. Even after all her mother\'s disquisitions Verena had but\r\nvague ideas as to whom she would have liked them to be; and it was only\r\nwhen the girl talked of the concerts, to all of which Olive subscribed\r\nand conducted her inseparable friend, that Mrs. Tarrant appeared to feel\r\nin any degree that her daughter was living up to the standard formed for\r\nher in their Cambridge home. As all the world knows, the opportunities\r\nin Boston for hearing good music are numerous and excellent, and it had\r\nlong been Miss Chancellor\'s practice to cultivate the best. She went in,\r\nas the phrase is, for the superior programmes, and that high, dim,\r\ndignified Music Hall, which has echoed in its time to so much eloquence\r\nand so much melody, and of which the very proportions and colour seem to\r\nteach respect and attention, shed the protection of its illuminated\r\ncornice, this winter, upon no faces more intelligently upturned than\r\nthose of the young women for whom Bach and Beethoven only repeated, in a\r\nmyriad forms, the idea that was always with them. Symphonies and fugues\r\nonly stimulated their convictions, excited their revolutionary passion,\r\nled their imagination further in the direction in which it was always\r\npressing. It lifted them to immeasurable heights; and as they sat\r\nlooking at the great florid, sombre organ, overhanging the bronze statue\r\nof Beethoven, they felt that this was the only temple in which the\r\nvotaries of their creed could worship.\r\n\r\nAnd yet their music was not their greatest joy, for they had two others\r\nwhich they cultivated at least as zealously. One of these was simply the\r\nsociety of old Miss Birdseye, of whom Olive saw more this winter than\r\nshe had ever seen before. It had become apparent that her long and\r\nbeautiful career was drawing to a close, her earnest, unremitting work\r\nwas over, her old-fashioned weapons were broken and dull. Olive would\r\nhave liked to hang them up as venerable relics of a patient fight, and\r\nthis was what she seemed to do when she made the poor lady relate her\r\nbattles--never glorious and brilliant, but obscure and wastefully\r\nheroic--call back the figures of her companions in arms, exhibit her\r\nmedals and scars. Miss Birdseye knew that her uses were ended; she might\r\npretend still to go about the business of unpopular causes, might fumble\r\nfor papers in her immemorial satchel and think she had important\r\nappointments, might sign petitions, attend conventions, say to Doctor\r\nPrance that if she would only make her sleep she should live to see a\r\ngreat many improvements yet; she ached and was weary, growing almost as\r\nglad to look back (a great anomaly for Miss Birdseye) as to look\r\nforward. She let herself be coddled now by her friends of the new\r\ngeneration; there were days when she seemed to want nothing better than\r\nto sit by Olive\'s fire and ramble on about the old struggles, with a\r\nvague, comfortable sense--no physical rapture of Miss Birdseye\'s could\r\nbe very acute--of immunity from wet feet, from the draughts that prevail\r\nat thin meetings, of independence of street-cars that would probably\r\narrive overflowing; and also a pleased perception, not that she was an\r\nexample to these fresh lives which began with more advantages than hers,\r\nbut that she was in some degree an encouragement, as she helped them to\r\nmeasure the way the new truths had advanced--being able to tell them of\r\nsuch a different state of things when she was a young lady, the daughter\r\nof a very talented teacher (indeed her mother had been a teacher too),\r\ndown in Connecticut. She had always had for Olive a kind of aroma of\r\nmartyrdom, and her battered, unremunerated, un-pensioned old age brought\r\nangry tears, springing from depths of outraged theory, into Miss\r\nChancellor\'s eyes. For Verena, too, she was a picturesque humanitary\r\nfigure. Verena had been in the habit of meeting martyrs from her\r\nchildhood up, but she had seen none with so many reminiscences as Miss\r\nBirdseye, or who had been so nearly scorched by penal fires. She had had\r\nescapes, in the early days of abolitionism, which it was a marvel she\r\ncould tell with so little implication that she had shown courage. She\r\nhad roamed through certain parts of the South, carrying the Bible to the\r\nslave; and more than one of her companions, in the course of these\r\nexpeditions, had been tarred and feathered. She herself, at one season,\r\nhad spent a month in a Georgian jail. She had preached temperance in\r\nIrish circles where the doctrine was received with missiles; she had\r\ninterfered between wives and husbands mad with drink; she had taken\r\nfilthy children, picked up in the street, to her own poor rooms, and had\r\nremoved their pestilent rags and washed their sore bodies with slippery\r\nlittle hands. In her own person she appeared to Olive and Verena a\r\nrepresentative of suffering humanity; the pity they felt for her was\r\npart of their pity for all who were weakest and most hardly used; and it\r\nstruck Miss Chancellor (more especially) that this frumpy little\r\nmissionary was the last link in a tradition, and that when she should be\r\ncalled away the heroic age of New England life--the age of plain living\r\nand high thinking, of pure ideals and earnest effort, of moral passion\r\nand noble experiment--would effectually be closed. It was the perennial\r\nfreshness of Miss Birdseye\'s faith that had had such a contagion for\r\nthese modern maidens, the unquenched flame of her transcendentalism, the\r\nsimplicity of her vision, the way in which, in spite of mistakes,\r\ndeceptions, the changing fashions of reform, which make the remedies of\r\na previous generation look as ridiculous as their bonnets, the only\r\nthing that was still actual for her was the elevation of the species by\r\nthe reading of Emerson and the frequentation of Tremont Temple. Olive\r\nhad been active enough, for years, in the city-missions; she too had\r\nscoured dirty children, and, in squalid lodging-houses, had gone into\r\nrooms where the domestic situation was strained and the noises made the\r\nneighbours turn pale. But she reflected that after such exertions she\r\nhad the refreshment of a pretty house, a drawing-room full of flowers, a\r\ncrackling hearth, where she threw in pine-cones and made them snap, an\r\nimported tea-service, a Chickering piano, and the _Deutsche Rundschau_;\r\nwhereas Miss Birdseye had only a bare, vulgar room, with a hideous\r\nflowered carpet (it looked like a dentist\'s), a cold furnace, the\r\nevening paper, and Doctor Prance. Olive and Verena were present at\r\nanother of her gatherings before the winter ended; it resembled the\r\noccasion that we described at the beginning of this history, with the\r\ndifference that Mrs. Farrinder was not there to oppress the company with\r\nher greatness, and that Verena made a speech without the co-operation of\r\nher father. This young lady had delivered herself with even finer effect\r\nthan before, and Olive could see how much she had gained, in confidence\r\nand range of allusion, since the educative process in Charles Street\r\nbegan. Her _motif_ was now a kind of unprepared tribute to Miss\r\nBirdseye, the fruit of the occasion and of the unanimous tenderness of\r\nthe younger members of the circle, which made her a willing mouthpiece.\r\nShe pictured her laborious career, her early associates (Eliza P.\r\nMoseley was not neglected as Verena passed), her difficulties and\r\ndangers and triumphs, her humanising effect upon so many, her serene and\r\nhonoured old age--expressed, in short, as one of the ladies said, just\r\nthe very way they all felt about her. Verena\'s face brightened and grew\r\ntriumphant as she spoke, but she brought tears into the eyes of most of\r\nthe others. It was Olive\'s opinion that nothing could be more graceful\r\nand touching, and she saw that the impression made was now deeper than\r\non the former evening. Miss Birdseye went about with her eighty years of\r\ninnocence, her undiscriminating spectacles, asking her friends if it\r\nwasn\'t perfectly splendid; she took none of it to herself, she regarded\r\nit only as a brilliant expression of Verena\'s gift. Olive thought,\r\nafterwards, that if a collection could only be taken up on the spot, the\r\ngood lady would be made easy for the rest of her days; then she\r\nremembered that most of her guests were as impecunious as herself.\r\n\r\nI have intimated that our young friends had a source of fortifying\r\nemotion which was distinct from the hours they spent with Beethoven and\r\nBach, or in hearing Miss Birdseye describe Concord as it used to be.\r\nThis consisted in the wonderful insight they had obtained into the\r\nhistory of feminine anguish. They perused that chapter perpetually and\r\nzealously, and they derived from it the purest part of their mission.\r\nOlive had pored over it so long, so earnestly, that she was now in\r\ncomplete possession of the subject; it was the one thing in life which\r\nshe felt she had really mastered. She was able to exhibit it to Verena\r\nwith the greatest authority and accuracy, to lead her up and down, in\r\nand out, through all the darkest and most tortuous passages. We know\r\nthat she was without belief in her own eloquence, but she was very\r\neloquent when she reminded Verena how the exquisite weakness of women\r\nhad never been their defence, but had only exposed them to sufferings\r\nmore acute than masculine grossness can conceive. Their odious partner\r\nhad trampled upon them from the beginning of time, and their tenderness,\r\ntheir abnegation, had been his opportunity. All the bullied wives, the\r\nstricken mothers, the dishonoured, deserted maidens who have lived on\r\nthe earth and longed to leave it, passed and repassed before her eyes,\r\nand the interminable dim procession seemed to stretch out a myriad hands\r\nto her. She sat with them at their trembling vigils, listened for the\r\ntread, the voice, at which they grew pale and sick, walked with them by\r\nthe dark waters that offered to wash away misery and shame, took with\r\nthem, even, when the vision grew intense, the last shuddering leap. She\r\nhad analysed to an extraordinary fineness their susceptibility, their\r\nsoftness; she knew (or she thought she knew) all the possible tortures\r\nof anxiety, of suspense and dread; and she had made up her mind that it\r\nwas women, in the end, who had paid for everything. In the last resort\r\nthe whole burden of the human lot came upon them; it pressed upon them\r\nfar more than on the others, the intolerable load of fate. It was they\r\nwho sat cramped and chained to receive it; it was they who had done all\r\nthe waiting and taken all the wounds. The sacrifices, the blood, the\r\ntears, the terrors were theirs. Their organism was in itself a challenge\r\nto suffering, and men had practised upon it with an impudence that knew\r\nno bounds. As they were the weakest most had been wrung from them, and\r\nas they were the most generous they had been most deceived. Olive\r\nChancellor would have rested her case, had it been necessary, on those\r\ngeneral facts; and her simple and comprehensive contention was that the\r\npeculiar wretchedness which had been the very essence of the feminine\r\nlot was a monstrous artificial imposition, crying aloud for redress. She\r\nwas willing to admit that women, too, could be bad; that there were many\r\nabout the world who were false, immoral, vile. But their errors were as\r\nnothing to their sufferings; they had expiated, in advance, an eternity,\r\nif need be, of misconduct. Olive poured forth these views to her\r\nlistening and responsive friend; she presented them again and again, and\r\nthere was no light in which they did not seem to palpitate with truth.\r\nVerena was immensely wrought upon; a subtle fire passed into her; she\r\nwas not so hungry for revenge as Olive, but at the last, before they\r\nwent to Europe (I shall take no place to describe the manner in which\r\nshe threw herself into that project), she quite agreed with her\r\ncompanion that after so many ages of wrong (it would also be after the\r\nEuropean journey) men must take _their_ turn, men must pay!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK SECOND\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI\r\n\r\n\r\nBasil Ransom lived in New York, rather far to the eastward, and in the\r\nupper reaches of the town; he occupied two small shabby rooms in a\r\nsomewhat decayed mansion which stood next to the corner of the Second\r\nAvenue. The corner itself was formed by a considerable grocer\'s shop,\r\nthe near neighbourhood of which was fatal to any pretensions Ransom and\r\nhis fellow-lodgers might have had in regard to gentility of situation.\r\nThe house had a red, rusty face, and faded green shutters, of which the\r\nslats were limp and at variance with each other. In one of the lower\r\nwindows was suspended a fly-blown card, with the words "Table Board"\r\naffixed in letters cut (not very neatly) out of coloured paper, of\r\ngraduated tints, and surrounded with a small band of stamped gilt. The\r\ntwo sides of the shop were protected by an immense pent-house shed,\r\nwhich projected over a greasy pavement and was supported by wooden posts\r\nfixed in the curbstone. Beneath it, on the dislocated flags, barrels and\r\nbaskets were freely and picturesquely grouped; an open cellarway yawned\r\nbeneath the feet of those who might pause to gaze too fondly on the\r\nsavoury wares displayed in the window; a strong odour of smoked fish,\r\ncombined with a fragrance of molasses, hung about the spot; the\r\npavement, toward the gutters, was fringed with dirty panniers, heaped\r\nwith potatoes, carrots, and onions; and a smart, bright waggon, with the\r\nhorse detached from the shafts, drawn up on the edge of the abominable\r\nroad (it contained holes and ruts a foot deep, and immemorial\r\naccumulations of stagnant mud), imparted an idle, rural, pastoral air to\r\na scene otherwise perhaps expressive of a rank civilisation. The\r\nestablishment was of the kind known to New Yorkers as a Dutch grocery;\r\nand red-faced, yellow-haired, bare-armed vendors might have been\r\nobserved to lounge in the doorway. I mention it not on account of any\r\nparticular influence it may have had on the life or the thoughts of\r\nBasil Ransom, but for old acquaintance sake and that of local colour;\r\nbesides which, a figure is nothing without a setting, and our young man\r\ncame and went every day, with rather an indifferent, unperceiving step,\r\nit is true, among the objects I have briefly designated. One of his\r\nrooms was directly above the street-door of the house; such a dormitory,\r\nwhen it is so exiguous, is called in the nomenclature of New York a\r\n"hall bedroom." The sitting-room, beside it, was slightly larger, and\r\nthey both commanded a row of tenements no less degenerate than Ransom\'s\r\nown habitation--houses built forty years before, and already sere and\r\nsuperannuated. These were also painted red, and the bricks were\r\naccentuated by a white line; they were garnished, on the first floor,\r\nwith balconies covered with small tin roofs, striped in different\r\ncolours, and with an elaborate iron lattice-work, which gave them a\r\nrepressive, cage-like appearance, and caused them slightly to resemble\r\nthe little boxes for peeping unseen into the street, which are a feature\r\nof oriental towns. Such posts of observation commanded a view of the\r\ngrocery on the corner, of the relaxed and disjointed roadway, enlivened\r\nat the curbstone with an occasional ash-barrel or with gas-lamps\r\ndrooping from the perpendicular, and westward, at the end of the\r\ntruncated vista, of the fantastic skeleton of the Elevated Railway,\r\noverhanging the transverse longitudinal street, which it darkened and\r\nsmothered with the immeasurable spinal column and myriad clutching paws\r\nof an antediluvian monster. If the opportunity were not denied me here,\r\nI should like to give some account of Basil Ransom\'s interior, of\r\ncertain curious persons of both sexes, for the most part not favourites\r\nof fortune, who had found an obscure asylum there; some picture of the\r\ncrumpled little _table d\'h\xf4te_, at two dollars and a half a week, where\r\neverything felt sticky, which went forward in the low-ceiled basement,\r\nunder the conduct of a couple of shuffling negresses, who mingled in the\r\nconversation and indulged in low, mysterious chuckles when it took a\r\nfacetious turn. But we need, in strictness, concern ourselves with it no\r\nfurther than to gather the implication that the young Mississippian,\r\neven a year and a half after that momentous visit of his to Boston, had\r\nnot made his profession very lucrative.\r\n\r\nHe had been diligent, he had been ambitious, but he had not yet been\r\nsuccessful. During the few weeks preceding the moment at which we meet\r\nhim again, he had even begun to lose faith altogether in his earthly\r\ndestiny. It became much of a question with him whether success in any\r\nform was written there; whether for a hungry young Mississippian,\r\nwithout means, without friends, wanting, too, in the highest energy, the\r\nwisdom of the serpent, personal arts and national prestige, the game of\r\nlife was to be won in New York. He had been on the point of giving it up\r\nand returning to the home of his ancestors, where, as he heard from his\r\nmother, there was still just a sufficient supply of hot corn-cake to\r\nsupport existence. He had never believed much in his luck, but during\r\nthe last year it had been guilty of aberrations surprising even to a\r\nconstant, an imperturbable, victim of fate. Not only had he not extended\r\nhis connexion, but he had lost most of the little business which was an\r\nobject of complacency to him a twelvemonth before. He had had none but\r\nsmall jobs, and he had made a mess of more than one of them. Such\r\naccidents had not had a happy effect upon his reputation; he had been\r\nable to perceive that this fair flower may be nipped when it is so\r\ntender a bud as scarcely to be palpable. He had formed a partnership\r\nwith a person who seemed likely to repair some of his deficiencies--a\r\nyoung man from Rhode Island, acquainted, according to his own\r\nexpression, with the inside track. But this gentleman himself, as it\r\nturned out, would have been better for a good deal of remodelling, and\r\nRansom\'s principal deficiency, which was, after all, that of cash, was\r\nnot less apparent to him after his colleague, prior to a sudden and\r\nunexplained departure for Europe, had drawn the slender accumulations of\r\nthe firm out of the bank. Ransom sat for hours in his office, waiting\r\nfor clients who either did not come, or, if they did come, did not seem\r\nto find him encouraging, as they usually left him with the remark that\r\nthey would think what they would do. They thought to little purpose, and\r\nseldom reappeared, so that at last he began to wonder whether there were\r\nnot a prejudice against his Southern complexion. Perhaps they didn\'t\r\nlike the way he spoke. If they could show him a better way, he was\r\nwilling to adopt it; but the manner of New York could not be acquired by\r\nprecept, and example, somehow, was not in this case contagious. He\r\nwondered whether he were stupid and unskilled, and he was finally\r\nobliged to confess to himself that he was unpractical.\r\n\r\nThis confession was in itself a proof of the fact, for nothing could be\r\nless fruitful than such a speculation, terminating in such a way. He was\r\nperfectly aware that he cared a great deal for the theory, and so his\r\nvisitors must have thought when they found him, with one of his long\r\nlegs twisted round the other, reading a volume of De Tocqueville. That\r\nwas the land of reading he liked; he had thought a great deal about\r\nsocial and economical questions, forms of government and the happiness\r\nof peoples. The convictions he had arrived at were not such as mix\r\ngracefully with the time-honoured verities a young lawyer looking out\r\nfor business is in the habit of taking for granted; but he had to\r\nreflect that these doctrines would probably not contribute any more to\r\nhis prosperity in Mississippi than in New York. Indeed, he scarcely\r\ncould think of the country where they would be a particular advantage to\r\nhim. It came home to him that his opinions were stiff, whereas in\r\ncomparison his effort was lax; and he accordingly began to wonder\r\nwhether he might not make a living by his opinions. He had always had a\r\ndesire for public life; to cause one\'s ideas to be embodied in national\r\nconduct appeared to him the highest form of human enjoyment. But there\r\nwas little enough that was public in his solitary studies, and he asked\r\nhimself what was the use of his having an office at all, and why he\r\nmight not as well carry on his profession at the Astor Library, where,\r\nin his spare hours and on chance holidays, he did an immense deal of\r\nsuggestive reading. He took copious notes and memoranda, and these\r\nthings sometimes shaped themselves in a way that might possibly commend\r\nthem to the editors of periodicals. Readers perhaps would come, if\r\nclients didn\'t; so he produced, with a great deal of labour,\r\nhalf-a-dozen articles, from which, when they were finished, it seemed to\r\nhim that he had omitted all the points he wished most to make, and\r\naddressed them to the powers that preside over weekly and monthly\r\npublications. They were all declined with thanks, and he would have been\r\nforced to believe that the accent of his languid clime brought him luck\r\nas little under the pen as on the lips, had not another explanation been\r\nsuggested by one of the more explicit of his oracles, in relation to a\r\npaper on the rights of minorities. This gentleman pointed out that his\r\ndoctrines were about three hundred years behind the age; doubtless some\r\nmagazine of the sixteenth century would have been very happy to print\r\nthem. This threw light on his own suspicion that he was attached to\r\ncauses that could only, in the nature of things, be unpopular. The\r\ndisagreeable editor was right about his being out of date, only he had\r\ngot the time wrong. He had come centuries too soon; he was not too old,\r\nbut too new. Such an impression, however, would not have prevented him\r\nfrom going into politics, if there had been any other way to represent\r\nconstituencies than by being elected. People might be found eccentric\r\nenough to vote for him in Mississippi, but meanwhile where should he\r\nfind the twenty-dollar greenbacks which it was his ambition to transmit\r\nfrom time to time to his female relations, confined so constantly to a\r\nfarinaceous diet? It came over him with some force that his opinions\r\nwould not yield interest, and the evaporation of this pleasing\r\nhypothesis made him feel like a man in an open boat, at sea, who should\r\njust have parted with his last rag of canvas.\r\n\r\nI shall not attempt a complete description of Ransom\'s ill-starred\r\nviews, being convinced that the reader will guess them as he goes, for\r\nthey had a frolicsome, ingenious way of peeping out of the young man\'s\r\nconversation. I shall do them sufficient justice in saying that he was\r\nby natural disposition a good deal of a stoic, and that, as the result\r\nof a considerable intellectual experience, he was, in social and\r\npolitical matters, a reactionary. I suppose he was very conceited, for\r\nhe was much addicted to judging his age. He thought it talkative,\r\nquerulous, hysterical, maudlin, full of false ideas, of unhealthy germs,\r\nof extravagant, dissipated habits, for which a great reckoning was in\r\nstore. He was an immense admirer of the late Thomas Carlyle, and was\r\nvery suspicious of the encroachments of modern democracy. I know not\r\nexactly how these queer heresies had planted themselves, but he had a\r\nlongish pedigree (it had flowered at one time with English royalists and\r\ncavaliers), and he seemed at moments to be inhabited by some transmitted\r\nspirit of a robust but narrow ancestor, some broad-faced wig-wearer or\r\nsword-bearer, with a more primitive conception of manhood than our\r\nmodern temperament appears to require, and a programme of human felicity\r\nmuch less varied. He liked his pedigree, he revered his forefathers, and\r\nhe rather pitied those who might come after him. In saying so, however,\r\nI betray him a little, for he never mentioned such feelings as these.\r\nThough he thought the age too talkative, as I have hinted, he liked to\r\ntalk as well as any one; but he could hold his tongue, if that were more\r\nexpressive, and he usually did so when his perplexities were greatest.\r\nHe had been sitting for several evenings in a beer-cellar, smoking his\r\npipe with a profundity of reticence. This attitude was so unbroken that\r\nit marked a crisis--the complete, the acute consciousness of his\r\npersonal situation. It was the cheapest way he knew of spending an\r\nevening. At this particular establishment the _Schoppen_ were very tall\r\nand the beer was very good; and as the host and most of the guests were\r\nGerman, and their colloquial tongue was unknown to him, he was not drawn\r\ninto any undue expenditure of speech. He watched his smoke and he\r\nthought, thought so hard that at last he appeared to himself to have\r\nexhausted the thinkable. When this moment of combined relief and dismay\r\narrived (on the last of the evenings that we are concerned with), he\r\ntook his way down Third Avenue and reached his humble dwelling. Till\r\nwithin a short time there had been a resource for him at such an hour\r\nand in such a mood; a little variety-actress, who lived in the house,\r\nand with whom he had established the most cordial relations, was often\r\nhaving her supper (she took it somewhere, every night, after the\r\ntheatre) in the dim, close dining-room, and he used to drop in and talk\r\nto her. But she had lately married, to his great amusement, and her\r\nhusband had taken her on a wedding-tour, which was to be at the same\r\ntime professional. On this occasion he mounted, with rather a heavy\r\ntread, to his rooms, where (on the rickety writing-table in the parlour)\r\nhe found a note from Mrs. Luna. I need not reproduce it _in extenso_; a\r\npale reflexion of it will serve. She reproached him with neglecting her,\r\nwanted to know what had become of him, whether he had grown too\r\nfashionable for a person who cared only for serious society. She accused\r\nhim of having changed, and inquired as to the reason of his coldness.\r\nWas it too much to ask whether he could tell her at least in what manner\r\nshe had offended him? She used to think they were so much in\r\nsympathy--he expressed her own ideas about everything so vividly. She\r\nliked intellectual companionship, and she had none now. She hoped very\r\nmuch he would come and see her--as he used to do six months before--the\r\nfollowing evening; and however much she might have sinned or he might\r\nhave altered, she was at least always his affectionate cousin Adeline.\r\n\r\n"What the deuce does she want of me now?" It was with this somewhat\r\nungracious exclamation that he tossed away his cousin Adeline\'s missive.\r\nThe gesture might have indicated that he meant to take no notice of her;\r\nnevertheless, after a day had elapsed, he presented himself before her.\r\nHe knew what she wanted of old--that is, a year ago; she had wanted him\r\nto look after her property and to be tutor to her son. He had lent\r\nhimself, good-naturedly, to this desire--he was touched by so much\r\nconfidence--but the experiment had speedily collapsed. Mrs. Luna\'s\r\naffairs were in the hands of trustees, who had complete care of them,\r\nand Ransom instantly perceived that his function would be simply to\r\nmeddle in things that didn\'t concern him. The levity with which she had\r\nexposed him to the derision of the lawful guardians of her fortune\r\nopened his eyes to some of the dangers of cousinship; nevertheless he\r\nsaid to himself that he might turn an honest penny by giving an hour or\r\ntwo every day to the education of her little boy. But this, too, proved\r\na brief illusion. Ransom had to find his time in the afternoon; he left\r\nhis business at five o\'clock and remained with his young kinsman till\r\nthe hour of dinner. At the end of a few weeks he thought himself lucky\r\nin retiring without broken shins. That Newton\'s little nature was\r\nremarkable had often been insisted on by his mother; but it was\r\nremarkable, Ransom saw, for the absence of any of the qualities which\r\nattach a teacher to a pupil. He was in truth an insufferable child,\r\nentertaining for the Latin language a personal, physical hostility,\r\nwhich expressed itself in convulsions of rage. During these paroxysms he\r\nkicked furiously at every one and everything--at poor "Rannie," at his\r\nmother, at Messrs. Andrews and Stoddard, at the illustrious men of Rome,\r\nat the universe in general, to which, as he lay on his back on the\r\ncarpet, he presented a pair of singularly active little heels. Mrs. Luna\r\nhad a way of being present at his lessons, and when they passed, as\r\nsooner or later they were sure to, into the stage I have described, she\r\ninterceded for her overwrought darling, reminded Ransom that these were\r\nthe signs of an exquisite sensibility, begged that the child might be\r\nallowed to rest a little, and spent the remainder of the time in\r\nconversation with the preceptor. It came to seem to him, very soon, that\r\nhe was not earning his fee; besides which, it was disagreeable to him to\r\nhave pecuniary relations with a lady who had not the art of concealing\r\nfrom him that she liked to place him under obligations. He resigned his\r\ntutorship, and drew a long breath, having a vague feeling that he had\r\nescaped a danger. He could not have told you exactly what it was, and he\r\nhad a certain sentimental, provincial respect for women which even\r\nprevented him from attempting to give a name to it in his own thoughts.\r\nHe was addicted with the ladies to the old forms of address and of\r\ngallantry; he held that they were delicate, agreeable creatures, whom\r\nProvidence had placed under the protection of the bearded sex; and it\r\nwas not merely a humorous idea with him that whatever might be the\r\ndefects of Southern gentlemen, they were at any rate remarkable for\r\ntheir chivalry. He was a man who still, in a slangy age, could pronounce\r\nthat word with a perfectly serious face.\r\n\r\nThis boldness did not prevent him from thinking that women were\r\nessentially inferior to men, and infinitely tiresome when they declined\r\nto accept the lot which men had made for them. He had the most definite\r\nnotions about their place in nature, in society, and was perfectly easy\r\nin his mind as to whether it excluded them from any proper homage. The\r\nchivalrous man paid that tax with alacrity. He admitted their rights;\r\nthese consisted in a standing claim to the generosity and tenderness of\r\nthe stronger race. The exercise of such feelings was full of advantage\r\nfor both sexes, and they flowed most freely, of course, when women were\r\ngracious and grateful. It may be said that he had a higher conception of\r\npoliteness than most of the persons who desired the advent of female\r\nlaw-makers. When I have added that he hated to see women eager and\r\nargumentative, and thought that their softness and docility were the\r\ninspiration, the opportunity (the highest) of man, I shall have sketched\r\na state of mind which will doubtless strike many readers as painfully\r\ncrude. It had prevented Basil Ransom, at any rate, from putting the dots\r\non his _i_\'s, as the French say, in this gradual discovery that Mrs.\r\nLuna was making love to him. The process went on a long time before he\r\nbecame aware of it. He had perceived very soon that she was a\r\ntremendously familiar little woman--that she took, more rapidly than he\r\nhad ever known, a high degree of intimacy for granted. But as she had\r\nseemed to him neither very fresh nor very beautiful, so he could not\r\neasily have represented to himself why she should take it into her head\r\nto marry (it would never have occurred to him to doubt that she wanted\r\nmarriage) an obscure and penniless Mississippian, with womenkind of his\r\nown to provide for. He could not guess that he answered to a certain\r\nsecret ideal of Mrs. Luna\'s, who loved the landed gentry even when\r\nlandless, who adored a Southerner under any circumstances, who thought\r\nher kinsman a fine, manly, melancholy, disinterested type, and who was\r\nsure that her views of public matters, the questions of the age, the\r\nvulgar character of modern life, would meet with a perfect response in\r\nhis mind. She could see by the way he talked that he was a conservative,\r\nand this was the motto inscribed upon her own silken banner. She took\r\nthis unpopular line both by temperament and by reaction from her\r\nsister\'s "extreme" views, the sight of the dreadful people that they\r\nbrought about her. In reality, Olive was distinguished and\r\ndiscriminating, and Adeline was the dupe of confusions in which the\r\nworse was apt to be mistaken for the better. She talked to Ransom about\r\nthe inferiority of republics, the distressing persons she had met abroad\r\nin the legations of the United States, the bad manners of servants and\r\nshopkeepers in that country, the hope she entertained that "the good old\r\nfamilies" would make a stand; but he never suspected that she cultivated\r\nthese topics (her treatment of them struck him as highly comical) for\r\nthe purpose of leading him to the altar, of beguiling the way. Least of\r\nall could he suppose that she would be indifferent to his want of\r\nincome--a point in which he failed to do her justice; for, thinking the\r\nfact that he had remained poor a proof of delicacy in that shopkeeping\r\nage, it gave her much pleasure to reflect that, as Newton\'s little\r\nproperty was settled on him (with safeguards which showed how\r\nlong-headed poor Mr. Luna had been, and large-hearted, too, since to\r\nwhat he left _her_ no disagreeable conditions, such as eternal mourning,\r\nfor instance, were attached)--that as Newton, I say, enjoyed the\r\npecuniary independence which befitted his character, her own income was\r\nample even for two, and she might give herself the luxury of taking a\r\nhusband who should owe her something. Basil Ransom did not divine all\r\nthis, but he divined that it was not for nothing that Mrs. Luna wrote\r\nhim little notes every other day, that she proposed to drive him in the\r\nPark at unnatural hours, and that when he said he had his business to\r\nattend to, she replied: "Oh, a plague on your business! I am sick of\r\nthat word--one hears of nothing else in America. There are ways of\r\ngetting on without business, if you would only take them!" He seldom\r\nanswered her notes, and he disliked extremely the way in which, in spite\r\nof her love of form and order, she attempted to clamber in at the window\r\nof one\'s house when one had locked the door; so that he began to\r\ninterspace his visits considerably, and at last made them very rare.\r\nWhen I reflect on his habits of almost superstitious politeness to\r\nwomen, it comes over me that some very strong motive must have operated\r\nto make him give his friendly--his only too friendly--cousin the cold\r\nshoulder. Nevertheless, when he received her reproachful letter (after\r\nit had had time to work a little), he said to himself that he had\r\nperhaps been unjust and even brutal, and as he was easily touched by\r\nremorse of this kind, he took up the broken thread.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII\r\n\r\n\r\nAs he sat with Mrs. Luna, in her little back drawing-room, under the\r\nlamp, he felt rather more tolerant than before of the pressure she could\r\nnot help putting upon him. Several months had elapsed, and he was no\r\nnearer to the sort of success he had hoped for. It stole over him gently\r\nthat there was another sort, pretty visibly open to him, not so elevated\r\nnor so manly, it is true, but on which he should after all, perhaps, be\r\nable to reconcile it with his honour to fall back. Mrs. Luna had had an\r\ninspiration; for once in her life she had held her tongue. She had not\r\nmade him a scene, there had been no question of an explanation; she had\r\nreceived him as if he had been there the day before, with the addition\r\nof a spice of mysterious melancholy. She might have made up her mind\r\nthat she had lost him as what she had hoped, but that it was better than\r\ndesolation to try and keep him as a friend. It was as if she wished him\r\nto see now how she tried. She was subdued and consolatory, she waited\r\nupon him, moved away a screen that intercepted the fire, remarked that\r\nhe looked very tired, and rang for some tea. She made no inquiry about\r\nhis affairs, never asked if he had been busy and prosperous; and this\r\nreticence struck him as unexpectedly delicate and discreet; it was as if\r\nshe had guessed, by a subtle feminine faculty, that his professional\r\ncareer was nothing to boast of. There was a simplicity in him which\r\npermitted him to wonder whether she had not improved. The lamp-light was\r\nsoft, the fire crackled pleasantly, everything that surrounded him\r\nbetrayed a woman\'s taste and touch; the place was decorated and\r\ncushioned in perfection, delightfully private and personal, the picture\r\nof a well-appointed home. Mrs. Luna had complained of the difficulties\r\nof installing one\'s self in America, but Ransom remembered that he had\r\nreceived an impression similar to this in her sister\'s house in Boston,\r\nand reflected that these ladies had, as a family-trait, the art of\r\nmaking themselves comfortable. It was better for a winter\'s evening than\r\nthe German beer-cellar (Mrs. Luna\'s tea was excellent), and his hostess\r\nherself appeared to-night almost as amiable as the variety-actress. At\r\nthe end of an hour he felt, I will not say almost marriageable, but\r\nalmost married. Images of leisure played before him, leisure in which he\r\nsaw himself covering foolscap paper with his views on several subjects,\r\nand with favourable illustrations of Southern eloquence. It became\r\ntolerably vivid to him that if editors wouldn\'t print one\'s\r\nlucubrations, it would be a comfort to feel that one was able to publish\r\nthem at one\'s own expense.\r\n\r\nHe had a moment of almost complete illusion. Mrs. Luna had taken up her\r\nbit of crochet; she was sitting opposite to him, on the other side of\r\nthe fire. Her white hands moved with little jerks as she took her\r\nstitches, and her rings flashed and twinkled in the light of the hearth.\r\nHer head fell a little to one side, exhibiting the plumpness of her chin\r\nand neck, and her dropped eyes (it gave her a little modest air) rested\r\nquietly on her work. A silence of a few moments had fallen upon their\r\ntalk, and Adeline--who decidedly _had_ improved--appeared also to feel\r\nthe charm of it, not to wish to break it. Basil Ransom was conscious of\r\nall this, and at the same time he was vaguely engaged in a speculation.\r\nIf it gave one time, if it gave one leisure, was not that in itself a\r\nhigh motive? Thorough study of the question he cared for most--was not\r\nthe chance for _that_ an infinitely desirable good? He seemed to see\r\nhimself, to feel himself, in that very chair, in the evenings of the\r\nfuture, reading some indispensable book in the still lamp-light--Mrs.\r\nLuna knew where to get such pretty mellowing shades. Should he not be\r\nable to act in that way upon the public opinion of his time, to check\r\ncertain tendencies, to point out certain dangers, to indulge in much\r\nsalutary criticism? Was it not one\'s duty to put one\'s self in the best\r\nconditions for such action? And as the silence continued he almost fell\r\nto musing on his duty, almost persuaded himself that the moral law\r\ncommanded him to marry Mrs. Luna. She looked up presently from her work,\r\ntheir eyes met, and she smiled. He might have believed she had guessed\r\nwhat he was thinking of. This idea startled him, alarmed him a little,\r\nso that when Mrs. Luna said, with her sociable manner, "There is nothing\r\nI like so much, of a winter\'s night, as a cosy _t\xeate-\xe0-t\xeate_ by the\r\nfire. It\'s quite like Darby and Joan; what a pity the kettle has ceased\r\nsinging!"--when she uttered these insinuating words he gave himself a\r\nlittle imperceptible shake, which was, however, enough to break the\r\nspell, and made no response more direct than to ask her, in a moment, in\r\na tone of cold, mild curiosity, whether she had lately heard from her\r\nsister, and how long Miss Chancellor intended to remain in Europe.\r\n\r\n"Well, you _have_ been living in your hole!" Mrs. Luna exclaimed. "Olive\r\ncame home six weeks ago. How long did you expect her to endure it?"\r\n\r\n"I am sure I don\'t know; I have never been there," Ransom replied.\r\n\r\n"Yes, that\'s what I like you for," Mrs. Luna remarked sweetly. "If a man\r\nis nice without it, it\'s such a pleasant change."\r\n\r\nThe young man started, then gave a natural laugh. "Lord, how few reasons\r\nthere must be!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I mention that one because I can tell it. I shouldn\'t care to tell\r\nthe others."\r\n\r\n"I am glad you have some to fall back upon, the day I should go," Ransom\r\nwent on. "I thought you thought so much of Europe."\r\n\r\n"So I do; but it isn\'t everything," said Mrs. Luna philosophically. "You\r\nhad better go there with me," she added, with a certain inconsequence.\r\n\r\n"One would go to the end of the world with so irresistible a lady!"\r\nRansom exclaimed, falling into the tone which Mrs. Luna always found so\r\nunsatisfactory. It was a part of his Southern gallantry--his accent\r\nalways came out strongly when he said anything of that sort--and it\r\ncommitted him to nothing in particular. She had had occasion to wish,\r\nmore than once, that he wouldn\'t be so beastly polite, as she used to\r\nhear people say in England. She answered that she didn\'t care about\r\nends, she cared about beginnings; but he didn\'t take up the declaration;\r\nhe returned to the subject of Olive, wanted to know what she had done\r\nover there, whether she had worked them up much.\r\n\r\n"Oh, of course, she fascinated every one," said Mrs. Luna. "With her\r\ngrace and beauty, her general style, how could she help that?"\r\n\r\n"But did she bring them round, did she swell the host that is prepared\r\nto march under her banner?"\r\n\r\n"I suppose she saw plenty of the strong-minded, plenty of vicious old\r\nmaids, and fanatics, and frumps. But I haven\'t the least idea what she\r\naccomplished--what they call \'wonders,\' I suppose."\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t you see her when she returned?" Basil Ransom asked.\r\n\r\n"How could I see her? I can see pretty far, but I can\'t see all the way\r\nto Boston." And then, in explaining that it was at this port that her\r\nsister had disembarked, Mrs. Luna further inquired whether he could\r\nimagine Olive doing anything in a first-rate way, as long as there were\r\ninferior ones. "Of course she likes bad ships--Boston steamers--just as\r\nshe likes common people, and red-haired hoydens, and preposterous\r\ndoctrines."\r\n\r\nRansom was silent a moment. "Do you mean the--a--rather striking young\r\nlady whom I met in Boston a year ago last October? What was her\r\nname?--Miss Tarrant? Does Miss Chancellor like her as much as ever?"\r\n\r\n"Mercy! don\'t you know she took her to Europe? It was to form _her_ mind\r\nshe went. Didn\'t I tell you that last summer? You used to come to see me\r\nthen."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, I remember," Ransom said, rather musingly. "And did she bring\r\nher back?"\r\n\r\n"Gracious, you don\'t suppose she would leave her! Olive thinks she\'s\r\nborn to regenerate the world."\r\n\r\n"I remember you telling me that, too. It comes back to me. Well, is her\r\nmind formed?"\r\n\r\n"As I haven\'t seen it, I cannot tell you."\r\n\r\n"Aren\'t you going on there to see----"\r\n\r\n"To see whether Miss Tarrant\'s mind is formed?" Mrs. Luna broke in. "I\r\nwill go if you would like me to. I remember your being immensely excited\r\nabout her that time you met her. Don\'t you recollect that?"\r\n\r\nRansom hesitated an instant. "I can\'t say I do. It is too long ago."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I have no doubt that\'s the way you change, about women! Poor Miss\r\nTarrant, if she thinks she made an impression on you!"\r\n\r\n"She won\'t think about such things as that, if her mind has been formed\r\nby your sister," Ransom said. "It does come back to me now, what you\r\ntold me about the growth of their intimacy. And do they mean to go on\r\nliving together for ever?"\r\n\r\n"I suppose so--unless some one should take it into his head to marry\r\nVerena."\r\n\r\n"Verena--is that her name?" Ransom asked.\r\n\r\nMrs. Luna looked at him with a suspended needle. "Well! have you\r\nforgotten that too? You told me yourself you thought it so pretty, that\r\ntime in Boston, when you walked me up the hill." Ransom declared that he\r\nremembered that walk, but didn\'t remember everything he had said to her;\r\nand she suggested, very satirically, that perhaps he would like to marry\r\nVerena himself--he seemed so interested in her. Ransom shook his head\r\nsadly, and said he was afraid he was not in a position to marry;\r\nwhereupon Mrs. Luna asked him what he meant--did he mean (after a\r\nmoment\'s hesitation) that he was too poor?\r\n\r\n"Never in the world--I am very rich; I make an enormous income!" the\r\nyoung man exclaimed; so that, remarking his tone, and the slight flush\r\nof annoyance that rose to his face, Mrs. Luna was quick enough to judge\r\nthat she had overstepped the mark. She remembered (she ought to have\r\nremembered before) that he had never taken her in the least into his\r\nconfidence about his affairs. That was not the Southern way, and he was\r\nat least as proud as he was poor. In this surmise she was just; Basil\r\nRansom would have despised himself if he had been capable of confessing\r\nto a woman that he couldn\'t make a living. Such questions were none of\r\ntheir business (their business was simply to be provided for, practise\r\nthe domestic virtues, and be charmingly grateful), and there was, to his\r\nsense, something almost indecent in talking about them. Mrs. Luna felt\r\ndoubly sorry for him as she perceived that he denied himself the luxury\r\nof sympathy (that is, of hers), and the vague but comprehensive sigh\r\nthat passed her lips as she took up her crochet again was unusually\r\nexpressive of helplessness. She said that of course she knew how great\r\nhis talents were--he could do anything he wanted; and Basil Ransom\r\nwondered for a moment whether, if she were to ask him point-blank to\r\nmarry her, it would be consistent with the high courtesy of a Southern\r\ngentleman to refuse. After she should be his wife he might of course\r\nconfess to her that he was too poor to marry, for in that relation even\r\na Southern gentleman of the highest tone must sometimes unbend. But he\r\ndidn\'t in the least long for this arrangement, and was conscious that\r\nthe most pertinent sequel to her conjecture would be for him to take up\r\nhis hat and walk away.\r\n\r\nWithin five minutes, however, he had come to desire to do this almost as\r\nlittle as to marry Mrs. Luna. He wanted to hear more about the girl who\r\nlived with Olive Chancellor. Something had revived in him--an old\r\ncuriosity, an image half effaced--when he learned that she had come back\r\nto America. He had taken a wrong impression from what Mrs. Luna said,\r\nnearly a year before, about her sister\'s visit to Europe; he had\r\nsupposed it was to be a long absence, that Miss Chancellor wanted\r\nperhaps to get the little prophetess away from her parents, possibly\r\neven away from some amorous entanglement. Then, no doubt, they wanted to\r\nstudy up the woman-question with the facilities that Europe would offer;\r\nhe didn\'t know much about Europe, but he had an idea that it was a great\r\nplace for facilities. His knowledge of Miss Chancellor\'s departure,\r\naccompanied by her young companion, had checked at the time, on Ransom\'s\r\npart, a certain habit of idle but none the less entertaining retrospect.\r\nHis life, on the whole, had not been rich in episode, and that little\r\nchapter of his visit to his queer, clever, capricious cousin, with his\r\nevening at Miss Birdseye\'s, and his glimpse, repeated on the morrow, of\r\nthe strange, beautiful, ridiculous, red-haired young _improvisatrice_,\r\nunrolled itself in his memory like a page of interesting fiction. The\r\npage seemed to fade, however, when he heard that the two girls had gone,\r\nfor an indefinite time, to unknown lands; this carried them out of his\r\nrange, spoiled the perspective, diminished their actuality; so that for\r\nseveral months past, with his increase of anxiety about his own affairs,\r\nand the low pitch of his spirits, he had not thought at all about Verena\r\nTarrant. The fact that she was once more in Boston, with a certain\r\ncontiguity that it seemed to imply between Boston and New York,\r\npresented itself now as important and agreeable. He was conscious that\r\nthis was rather an anomaly, and his consciousness made him, had already\r\nmade him, dissimulate slightly. He did not pick up his hat to go; he sat\r\nin his chair taking his chance of the tax which Mrs. Luna might lay upon\r\nhis urbanity. He remembered that he had not made, as yet, any very eager\r\ninquiry about Newton, who at this late hour had succumbed to the only\r\ninfluence that tames the untamable and was sleeping the sleep of\r\nchildhood, if not of innocence. Ransom repaired his neglect in a manner\r\nwhich elicited the most copious response from his hostess. The boy had\r\nhad a good many tutors since Ransom gave him up, and it could not be\r\nsaid that his education languished. Mrs. Luna spoke with pride of the\r\nmanner in which he went through them; if he did not master his lessons,\r\nhe mastered his teachers, and she had the happy conviction that she gave\r\nhim every advantage. Ransom\'s delay was diplomatic, but at the end of\r\nten minutes he returned to the young ladies in Boston; he asked why,\r\nwith their aggressive programme, one hadn\'t begun to feel their onset,\r\nwhy the echoes of Miss Tarrant\'s eloquence hadn\'t reached his ears.\r\nHadn\'t she come out yet in public? was she not coming to stir them up in\r\nNew York? He hoped she hadn\'t broken down.\r\n\r\n"She didn\'t seem to break down last summer, at the Female Convention,"\r\nMrs. Luna replied. "Have you forgotten that too? Didn\'t I tell you of\r\nthe sensation she produced there, and of what I heard from Boston about\r\nit? Do you mean to say I didn\'t give you that "Transcript," with the\r\nreport of her great speech? It was just before they sailed for Europe;\r\nshe went off with flying colours, in a blaze of fireworks." Ransom\r\nprotested that he had not heard this affair mentioned till that moment,\r\nand then, when they compared dates, they found it had taken place just\r\nafter his last visit to Mrs. Luna. This, of course, gave her a chance to\r\nsay that he had treated her even worse than she supposed; it had been\r\nher impression, at any rate, that they had talked together about\r\nVerena\'s sudden bound into fame. Apparently she confounded him with some\r\none else, that was very possible; he was not to suppose that he occupied\r\nsuch a distinct place in her mind, especially when she might die twenty\r\ndeaths before he came near her. Ransom demurred to the implication that\r\nMiss Tarrant was famous; if she were famous, wouldn\'t she be in the New\r\nYork papers? He hadn\'t seen her there, and he had no recollection of\r\nhaving encountered any mention at the time (last June, was it?) of her\r\nexploits at the Female Convention. A local reputation doubtless she had,\r\nbut that had been the case a year and a half before, and what was\r\nexpected of her then was to become a first-class national glory. He was\r\nwilling to believe that she had created some excitement in Boston, but\r\nhe shouldn\'t attach much importance to that till one began to see her\r\nphotograph in the stores. Of course, one must give her time, but he had\r\nsupposed Miss Chancellor was going to put her through faster.\r\n\r\nIf he had taken a contradictious tone on purpose to draw Mrs. Luna out,\r\nhe could not have elicited more of the information he desired. It was\r\nperfectly true that he had seen no reference to Verena\'s performances in\r\nthe preceding June; there were periods when the newspapers seemed to him\r\nso idiotic that for weeks he never looked at one. He learned from Mrs.\r\nLuna that it was not Olive who had sent her the "Transcript" and in\r\nletters had added some private account of the doings at the convention\r\nto the testimony of that amiable sheet; she had been indebted for this\r\nservice to a "gentleman-friend," who wrote her everything that happened\r\nin Boston, and what every one had every day for dinner. Not that it was\r\nnecessary for her happiness to know; but the gentleman she spoke of\r\ndidn\'t know what to invent to please her. A Bostonian couldn\'t imagine\r\nthat one didn\'t want to know, and that was their idea of ingratiating\r\nthemselves, or, at any rate, it was his, poor man. Olive would never\r\nhave gone into particulars about Verena; she regarded her sister as\r\nquite too much one of the profane, and knew Adeline couldn\'t understand\r\nwhy, when she took to herself a bosom-friend, she should have been at\r\nsuch pains to select her in just the most dreadful class in the\r\ncommunity. Verena was a perfect little adventuress, and quite third-rate\r\ninto the bargain; but, of course, she was a pretty girl enough, if one\r\ncared for hair of the colour of cochineal. As for her people, they were\r\ntoo absolutely awful; it was exactly as if she, Mrs. Luna, had struck up\r\nan intimacy with the daughter of her chiropodist. It took Olive to\r\ninvent such monstrosities, and to think she was doing something great\r\nfor humanity when she did so; though, in spite of her wanting to turn\r\neverything over, and put the lowest highest, she could be just as\r\ncontemptuous and invidious, when it came to really mixing, as if she\r\nwere some grand old duchess. She must do her the justice to say that she\r\nhated the Tarrants, the father and mother; but, all the same, she let\r\nVerena run to and fro between Charles Street and the horrible hole they\r\nlived in, and Adeline knew from that gentleman who wrote so copiously\r\nthat the girl now and then spent a week at a time at Cambridge. Her\r\nmother, who had been ill for some weeks, wanted her to sleep there. Mrs.\r\nLuna knew further, by her correspondent, that Verena had--or had had the\r\nwinter before--a great deal of attention from gentlemen. She didn\'t know\r\nhow she worked that into the idea that the female sex was sufficient to\r\nitself; but she had grounds for saying that this was one reason why\r\nOlive had taken her abroad. She was afraid Verena would give in to some\r\nman, and she wanted to make a break. Of course, any such giving in would\r\nbe very awkward for a young woman who shrieked out on platforms that old\r\nmaids were the highest type. Adeline guessed Olive had perfect control\r\nof her now, unless indeed she used the expeditions to Cambridge as a\r\ncover for meeting gentlemen. She was an artful little minx, and cared as\r\nmuch for the rights of women as she did for the Panama Canal; the only\r\nright of a woman she wanted was to climb up on top of something, where\r\nthe men could look at her. She would stay with Olive as long as it\r\nserved her purpose, because Olive, with her great respectability, could\r\npush her, and counteract the effect of her low relations, to say nothing\r\nof paying all her expenses and taking her the tour of Europe. "But, mark\r\nmy words," said Mrs. Luna, "she will give Olive the greatest cut she has\r\never had in her life. She will run off with some lion-tamer; she will\r\nmarry a circus-man!" And Mrs. Luna added that it would serve Olive\r\nChancellor right. But she would take it hard; look out for tantrums\r\nthen!\r\n\r\nBasil Ransom\'s emotions were peculiar while his hostess delivered\r\nherself, in a manner at once casual and emphatic, of these rather\r\ninsidious remarks. He took them all in, for they represented to him\r\ncertain very interesting facts; but he perceived at the same time that\r\nMrs. Luna didn\'t know what she was talking about. He had seen Verena\r\nTarrant only twice in his life, but it was no use telling him that she\r\nwas an adventuress--though, certainly, it _was_ very likely she would\r\nend by giving Miss Chancellor a cut. He chuckled, with a certain\r\ngrimness, as this image passed before him; it was not unpleasing, the\r\nidea that he should be avenged (for it would avenge him to know it) upon\r\nthe wanton young woman who had invited him to come and see her in order\r\nsimply to slap his face. But he had an odd sense of having lost\r\nsomething in not knowing of the other girl\'s appearance at the Women\'s\r\nConvention--a vague feeling that he had been cheated and trifled with.\r\nThe complaint was idle, inasmuch as it was not probable he could have\r\ngone to Boston to listen to her; but it represented to him that he had\r\nnot shared, even dimly and remotely, in an event which concerned her\r\nvery closely. Why should he share, and what was more natural than that\r\nthe things which concerned her closely should not concern him at all?\r\nThis question came to him only as he walked home that evening; for the\r\nmoment it remained quite in abeyance: therefore he was free to feel also\r\nthat his imagination had been rather starved by his ignorance of the\r\nfact that she was near him again (comparatively), that she was in the\r\ndimness of the horizon (no longer beyond the curve of the globe), and\r\nyet he had not perceived it. This sense of personal loss, as I have\r\ncalled it, made him feel, further, that he had something to make up, to\r\nrecover. He could scarcely have told you how he would go about it; but\r\nthe idea, formless though it was, led him in a direction very different\r\nfrom the one he had been following a quarter of an hour before. As he\r\nwatched it dance before him he fell into another silence, in the midst\r\nof which Mrs. Luna gave him another mystic smile. The effect of it was\r\nto make him rise to his feet; the whole landscape of his mind had\r\nsuddenly been illuminated. Decidedly, it was _not_ his duty to marry\r\nMrs. Luna, in order to have means to pursue his studies; he jerked\r\nhimself back, as if he had been on the point of it.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t mean to say you are going already? I haven\'t said half I\r\nwanted to!" she exclaimed.\r\n\r\nHe glanced at the clock, saw it was not yet late, took a turn about the\r\nroom, then sat down again in a different place, while she followed him\r\nwith her eyes, wondering what was the matter with him. Ransom took good\r\ncare not to ask her what it was she had still to say, and perhaps it was\r\nto prevent her telling him that he now began to talk, freely, quickly,\r\nin quite a new tone. He stayed half an hour longer, and made himself\r\nvery agreeable. It seemed to Mrs. Luna now that he had every distinction\r\n(she had known he had most), that he was really a charming man. He\r\nabounded in conversation, till at last he took up his hat in earnest; he\r\ntalked about the state of the South, its social peculiarities, the ruin\r\nwrought by the war, the dilapidated gentry, the queer types of\r\nsuperannuated fire-eaters, ragged and unreconciled, all the pathos and\r\nall the comedy of it, making her laugh at one moment, almost cry at\r\nanother, and say to herself throughout that when he took it into his\r\nhead there was no one who could make a lady\'s evening pass so\r\npleasantly. It was only afterwards that she asked herself why he had not\r\ntaken it into his head till the last, so quickly. She delighted in the\r\ndilapidated gentry; her taste was completely different from her\r\nsister\'s, who took an interest only in the lower class, as it struggled\r\nto rise; what Adeline cared for was the fallen aristocracy (it seemed to\r\nbe falling everywhere very much; was not Basil Ransom an example of it?\r\nwas he not like a French _gentilhomme de province_ after the Revolution?\r\nor an old monarchical _\xe9migr\xe9_ from the Languedoc?), the despoiled\r\npatriciate, I say, whose attitude was noble and touching, and toward\r\nwhom one might exercise a charity as discreet as their pride was\r\nsensitive. In all Mrs. Luna\'s visions of herself, her discretion was the\r\nleading feature. "Are you going to let ten years elapse again before you\r\ncome?" she asked, as Basil Ransom bade her good-night. "You must let me\r\nknow, because between this and your next visit I shall have time to go\r\nto Europe and come back. I shall take care to arrive the day before."\r\n\r\nInstead of answering this sally, Ransom said, "Are you not going one of\r\nthese days to Boston? Are you not going to pay your sister another\r\nvisit?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Luna stared. "What good will that do _you_? Excuse my stupidity,"\r\nshe added; "of course, it gets me away. Thank you very much!"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want you to go away; but I want to hear more about Miss Olive."\r\n\r\n"Why in the world? You know you loathe her!" Here, before Ransom could\r\nreply, Mrs. Luna again overtook herself. "I verily believe that by Miss\r\nOlive you mean Miss Verena!" Her eyes charged him a moment with this\r\nperverse intention; then she exclaimed, "Basil Ransom, _are_ you in love\r\nwith that creature?"\r\n\r\nHe gave a perfectly natural laugh, not pleading guilty, in order to\r\npractise on Mrs. Luna, but expressing the simple state of the case. "How\r\nshould I be? I have seen her but twice in my life."\r\n\r\n"If you had seen her more, I shouldn\'t be afraid! Fancy your wanting to\r\npack me off to Boston!" his hostess went on. "I am in no hurry to stay\r\nwith Olive again; besides, that girl takes up the whole house. You had\r\nbetter go there yourself."\r\n\r\n"I should like nothing better," said Ransom.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you would like me to ask Verena to spend a month with me--it\r\nmight be a way of attracting you to the house," Adeline went on, in the\r\ntone of exuberant provocation.\r\n\r\nRansom was on the point of replying that it would be a better way than\r\nany other, but he checked himself in time; he had never yet, even in\r\njoke, made so crude, so rude a speech to a lady. You only knew when he\r\nwas joking with women by his super-added civility. "I beg you to believe\r\nthere is nothing I would do for any woman in the world that I wouldn\'t\r\ndo for you," he said, bending, for the last time, over Mrs. Luna\'s plump\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n"I shall remember that and keep you up to it!" she cried after him, as\r\nhe went. But even with this rather lively exchange of vows he felt that\r\nhe had got off rather easily. He walked slowly up Fifth Avenue, into\r\nwhich, out of Adeline\'s cross-street, he had turned, by the light of a\r\nfine winter moon; and at every corner he stopped a minute, lingered in\r\nmeditation, while he exhaled a soft, vague sigh. This was an\r\nunconscious, involuntary expression of relief, such as a man might utter\r\nwho had seen himself on the point of being run over and yet felt that he\r\nwas whole. He didn\'t trouble himself much to ask what had saved him;\r\nwhatever it was it had produced a reaction, so that he felt rather\r\nashamed of having found his look-out of late so blank. By the time he\r\nreached his lodgings, his ambition, his resolution, had rekindled; he\r\nhad remembered that he formerly supposed he was a man of ability, that\r\nnothing particular had occurred to make him doubt it (the evidence was\r\nonly negative, not positive), and that at any rate he was young enough\r\nto have another try. He whistled that night as he went to bed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThree weeks afterward he stood in front of Olive Chancellor\'s house,\r\nlooking up and down the street and hesitating. He had told Mrs. Luna\r\nthat he should like nothing better than to make another journey to\r\nBoston; and it was not simply because he liked it that he had come. I\r\nwas on the point of saying that a happy chance had favoured him, but it\r\noccurs to me that one is under no obligation to call chances by\r\nnattering epithets when they have been waited for so long. At any rate,\r\nthe darkest hour is before the dawn; and a few days after that\r\nmelancholy evening I have described, which Ransom spent in his German\r\nbeer-cellar, before a single glass, soon emptied, staring at his future\r\nwith an unremunerated eye, he found that the world appeared to have need\r\nof him yet. The "party," as he would have said (I cannot pretend that\r\nhis speech was too heroic for that), for whom he had transacted business\r\nin Boston so many months before, and who had expressed at the time but a\r\nlimited appreciation of his services (there had been between the lawyer\r\nand his client a divergence of judgement), observing, apparently, that\r\nthey proved more fruitful than he expected, had reopened the affair and\r\npresently requested Ransom to transport himself again to the sister\r\ncity. His errand demanded more time than before, and for three days he\r\ngave it his constant attention. On the fourth he found he was still\r\ndetained; he should have to wait till the evening--some important papers\r\nwere to be prepared. He determined to treat the interval as a holiday,\r\nand he wondered what one could do in Boston to give one\'s morning a\r\nfestive complexion. The weather was brilliant enough to minister to any\r\nillusion, and he strolled along the streets, taking it in. In front of\r\nthe Music Hall and of Tremont Temple he stopped, looking at the posters\r\nin the doorway; for was it not possible that Miss Chancellor\'s little\r\nfriend might be just then addressing her fellow-citizens? Her name was\r\nabsent, however, and this resource seemed to mock him. He knew no one in\r\nthe place but Olive Chancellor, so there was no question of a visit to\r\npay. He was perfectly resolved that he would never go near _her_ again;\r\nshe was doubtless a very superior being, but she had been too rough with\r\nhim to tempt him further. Politeness, even a largely-interpreted\r\n"chivalry", required nothing more than he had already done; he had\r\nquitted her, the other year, without telling her that she was a vixen,\r\nand that reticence was chivalrous enough. There was also Verena Tarrant,\r\nof course; he saw no reason to dissemble when he spoke of her to\r\nhimself, and he allowed himself the entertainment of feeling that he\r\nshould like very much to see her again. Very likely she wouldn\'t seem to\r\nhim the same; the impression she had made upon him was due to some\r\naccident of mood or circumstance; and, at any rate, any charm she might\r\nhave exhibited then had probably been obliterated by the coarsening\r\neffect of publicity and the tonic influence of his kinswoman. It will be\r\nobserved that in this reasoning of Basil Ransom\'s the impression was\r\nfreely recognised, and recognised as a phenomenon still present. The\r\nattraction might have vanished, as he said to himself, but the mental\r\npicture of it was yet vivid. The greater the pity that he couldn\'t call\r\nupon Verena (he called her by her name in his thoughts, it was so\r\npretty) without calling upon Olive, and that Olive was so disagreeable\r\nas to place that effort beyond his strength. There was another\r\nconsideration, with Ransom, which eminently belonged to the man; he\r\nbelieved that Miss Chancellor had conceived, in the course of those few\r\nhours, and in a manner that formed so absurd a sequel to her having gone\r\nout of her way to make his acquaintance, such a dislike to him that it\r\nwould be odious to her to see him again within her doors; and he would\r\nhave felt indelicate in taking warrant from her original invitation\r\n(before she had seen him) to inflict on her a presence which he had no\r\nreason to suppose the lapse of time had made less offensive. She had\r\ngiven him no sign of pardon or penitence in any of the little ways that\r\nare familiar to women--by sending him a message through her sister, or\r\neven a book, a photograph, a Christmas card, or a newspaper, by the\r\npost. He felt, in a word, not at liberty to ring at her door; he didn\'t\r\nknow what kind of a fit the sight of his long Mississippian person would\r\ngive her, and it was characteristic of him that he should wish so to\r\nspare the sensibilities of a young lady whom he had not found tender;\r\nbeing ever as willing to let women off easily in the particular case as\r\nhe was fixed in the belief that the sex in general requires watching.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, he found himself, at the end of half an hour, standing on\r\nthe only spot in Charles Street which had any significance for him. It\r\nhad occurred to him that if he couldn\'t call upon Verena without calling\r\nupon Olive, he should be exempt from that condition if he called upon\r\nMrs. Tarrant. It was not her mother, truly, who had asked him, it was\r\nthe girl herself; and he was conscious, as a candid young American, that\r\na mother is always less accessible, more guarded by social prejudice,\r\nthan a daughter. But he was at a pass in which it was permissible to\r\nstrain a point, and he took his way in the direction in which he knew\r\nthat Cambridge lay, remembering that Miss Tarrant\'s invitation had\r\nreference to that quarter and that Mrs. Luna had given him further\r\nevidence. Had she not said that Verena often went back there for visits\r\nof several days--that her mother had been ill and she gave her much\r\ncare? There was nothing inconceivable in her being engaged at that hour\r\n(it was getting to be one o\'clock) in one of those expeditions--nothing\r\nimpossible in the chance that he might find her in Cambridge. The\r\nchance, at any rate, was worth taking; Cambridge, moreover, was worth\r\nseeing, and it was as good a way as another of keeping his holiday. It\r\noccurred to him, indeed, that Cambridge was a big place, and that he had\r\nno particular address. This reflexion overtook him just as he reached\r\nOlive\'s house, which, oddly enough, he was obliged to pass on his way to\r\nthe mysterious suburb. That is partly why he paused there; he asked\r\nhimself for a moment why he shouldn\'t ring the bell and obtain his\r\nneeded information from the servant, who would be sure to be able to\r\ngive it to him. He had just dismissed this method, as of questionable\r\ntaste, when he heard the door of the house open, within the deep\r\nembrasure in which, in Charles Street, the main portals are set, and\r\nwhich are partly occupied by a flight of steps protected at the bottom\r\nby a second door, whose upper half, in either wing, consists of a sheet\r\nof glass. It was a minute before he could see who had come out, and in\r\nthat minute he had time to turn away and then to turn back again, and to\r\nwonder which of the two inmates would appear to him, or whether he\r\nshould behold neither or both.\r\n\r\nThe person who had issued from the house descended the steps very\r\nslowly, as if on purpose to give him time to escape; and when at last\r\nthe glass doors were divided they disclosed a little old lady. Ransom\r\nwas disappointed; such an apparition was so scantily to his purpose. But\r\nthe next minute his spirits rose again, for he was sure that he had seen\r\nthe little old lady before. She stopped on the side-walk, and looked\r\nvaguely about her, in the manner of a person waiting for an omnibus or a\r\nstreet-car; she had a dingy, loosely-habited air, as if she had worn her\r\nclothes for many years and yet was even now imperfectly acquainted with\r\nthem; a large, benignant face, caged in by the glass of her spectacles,\r\nwhich seemed to cover it almost equally everywhere, and a fat, rusty\r\nsatchel, which hung low at her side, as if it wearied her to carry it.\r\nThis gave Ransom time to recognise her; he knew in Boston no such figure\r\nas that save Miss Birdseye. Her party, her person, the exalted account\r\nMiss Chancellor gave of her, had kept a very distinct place in his mind;\r\nand while she stood there in dim circumspection she came back to him as\r\na friend of yesterday. His necessity gave a point to the reminiscences\r\nshe evoked; it took him only a moment to reflect that she would be able\r\nto tell him where Verena Tarrant was at that particular time, and where,\r\nif need be, her parents lived. Her eyes rested on him, and as she saw\r\nthat he was looking at her she didn\'t go through the ceremony (she had\r\nbroken so completely with all conventions) of removing them; he\r\nevidently represented nothing to her but a sentient fellow-citizen in\r\nthe enjoyment of his rights, which included that of staring. Miss\r\nBirdseye\'s modesty had never pretended that it was not to be publicly\r\nchallenged; there were so many bright new motives and ideas in the world\r\nthat there might even be reasons for looking at her. When Ransom\r\napproached her and, raising his hat with a smile, said, "Shall I stop\r\nthis car for you, Miss Birdseye?" she only looked at him more vaguely,\r\nin her complete failure to seize the idea that this might be simply\r\nFame. She had trudged about the streets of Boston for fifty years, and\r\nat no period had she received that amount of attention from dark-eyed\r\nyoung men. She glanced, in an unprejudiced way, at the big\r\nparti-coloured human van which now jingled, toward them from out of the\r\nCambridge road. "Well, I should like to get into it, if it will take me\r\nhome," she answered. "Is this a South End car?"\r\n\r\nThe vehicle had been stopped by the conductor, on his perceiving Miss\r\nBirdseye; he evidently recognised her as a frequent passenger. He went,\r\nhowever, through none of the forms of reassurance beyond remarking, "You\r\nwant to get right in here--quick," but stood with his hand raised, in a\r\nthreatening way, to the cord of his signal-bell.\r\n\r\n"You must allow me the honour of taking you home, madam; I will tell you\r\nwho I am," Basil Ransom said, in obedience to a rapid reflexion. He\r\nhelped her into the car, the conductor pressed a fraternal hand upon her\r\nback, and in a moment the young man was seated beside her, and the\r\njingling had recommenced. At that hour of the day the car was almost\r\nempty, and they had it virtually to themselves.\r\n\r\n"Well, I know you are some one; I don\'t think you belong round here,"\r\nMiss Birdseye declared, as they proceeded.\r\n\r\n"I was once at your house--on a very interesting occasion. Do you\r\nremember a party you gave, a year ago last October, to which Miss\r\nChancellor came, and another young lady, who made a wonderful speech?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes! when Verena Tarrant moved us all so! There were a good many\r\nthere; I don\'t remember all."\r\n\r\n"I was one of them," Basil Ransom said; "I came with Miss Chancellor,\r\nwho is a kind of relation of mine, and you were very good to me."\r\n\r\n"What did I do?" asked Miss Birdseye candidly. Then, before he could\r\nanswer her, she recognised him. "I remember you now, and Olive bringing\r\nyou! You\'re a Southern gentleman--she told me about you afterwards. You\r\ndon\'t approve of our great struggle--you want us to be kept down." The\r\nold lady spoke with perfect mildness, as if she had long ago done with\r\npassion and resentment. Then she added, "Well, I presume we can\'t have\r\nthe sympathy of all."\r\n\r\n"Doesn\'t it look as if you had my sympathy, when I get into a car on\r\npurpose to see you home--one of the principal agitators?" Ransom\r\ninquired, laughing.\r\n\r\n"Did you get in on purpose?"\r\n\r\n"Quite on purpose. I am not so bad as Miss Chancellor thinks me."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I presume you have your ideas," said Miss Birdseye. "Of course,\r\nSoutherners have peculiar views. I suppose they retain more than one\r\nmight think. I hope you won\'t ride too far--I know my way round Boston."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t object to me, or think me officious," Ransom replied. "I want to\r\nask you something."\r\n\r\nMiss Birdseye looked at him again. "Oh yes, I place you now; you\r\nconversed some with Doctor Prance."\r\n\r\n"To my great edification!" Ransom exclaimed. "And I hope Doctor Prance\r\nis well."\r\n\r\n"She looks after every one\'s health but her own," said Miss Birdseye,\r\nsmiling. "When I tell her that, she says she hasn\'t got any to look\r\nafter. She says she\'s the only woman in Boston that hasn\'t got a doctor.\r\nShe was determined she wouldn\'t be a patient, and it seemed as if the\r\nonly way not to be one was to be a doctor. She is trying to make me\r\nsleep; that\'s her principal occupation."\r\n\r\n"Is it possible you don\'t sleep yet?" Ransom asked, almost tenderly.\r\n\r\n"Well, just a little. But by the time I get to sleep I have to get up. I\r\ncan\'t sleep when I want to live."\r\n\r\n"You ought to come down South," the young man suggested. "In that\r\nlanguid air you would doze deliciously!"\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t want to be languid," said Miss Birdseye. "Besides, I have\r\nbeen down South, in the old times, and I can\'t say they let me sleep\r\nvery much; they were always round after me!"\r\n\r\n"Do you mean on account of the negroes?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I couldn\'t think of anything else then. I carried them the Bible."\r\n\r\nRansom was silent a moment; then he said, in a tone which evidently was\r\ncarefully considerate, "I should like to hear all about that!"\r\n\r\n"Well, fortunately, we are not required now; we are required for\r\nsomething else." And Miss Birdseye looked at him with a wandering,\r\ntentative humour, as if he would know what she meant.\r\n\r\n"You mean for the other slaves!" he exclaimed, with a laugh. "You can\r\ncarry them all the Bibles you want."\r\n\r\n"I want to carry them the Statute-book; that must be our Bible now."\r\n\r\nRansom found himself liking Miss Birdseye very much, and it was quite\r\nwithout hypocrisy or a tinge too much of the local quality in his speech\r\nthat he said: "Wherever you go, madam, it will matter little what you\r\ncarry. You will always carry your goodness."\r\n\r\nFor a minute she made no response. Then she murmured: "That\'s the way\r\nOlive Chancellor told me you talked."\r\n\r\n"I am afraid she has told you little good of me."\r\n\r\n"Well, I am sure she thinks she is right."\r\n\r\n"Thinks it?" said Ransom. "Why, she knows it, with supreme certainty! By\r\nthe way, I hope she is well."\r\n\r\nMiss Birdseye stared again. "Haven\'t you seen her? Are you not\r\nvisiting?"\r\n\r\n"Oh no, I am not visiting! I was literally passing her house when I met\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you live here now," said Miss Birdseye. And when he had\r\ncorrected this impression, she added, in a tone which showed with what\r\npositive confidence he had now inspired her, "Hadn\'t you better drop\r\nin?"\r\n\r\n"It would give Miss Chancellor no pleasure," Basil Ransom rejoined. "She\r\nregards me as an enemy in the camp."\r\n\r\n"Well, she is very brave."\r\n\r\n"Precisely. And I am very timid."\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t you fight once?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; but it was in such a good cause!"\r\n\r\nRansom meant this allusion to the great Secession and, by comparison, to\r\nthe attitude of the resisting male (laudable even as that might be), to\r\nbe decently jocular; but Miss Birdseye took it very seriously, and sat\r\nthere for a good while as speechless as if she meant to convey that she\r\nhad been going on too long now to be able to discuss the propriety of\r\nthe late rebellion. The young man felt that he had silenced her, and he\r\nwas very sorry; for, with all deference to the disinterested Southern\r\nattitude toward the unprotected female, what he had got into the car\r\nwith her for was precisely to make her talk. He had wished for general,\r\nas well as for particular, news of Verena Tarrant; it was a topic on\r\nwhich he had proposed to draw Miss Birdseye out. He preferred not to\r\nbroach it himself, and he waited awhile for another opening. At last,\r\nwhen he was on the point of exposing himself by a direct inquiry (he\r\nreflected that the exposure would in any case not be long averted), she\r\nanticipated him by saying, in a manner which showed that her thoughts\r\nhad continued in the same train, "I wonder very much that Miss Tarrant\r\ndidn\'t affect you that evening!"\r\n\r\n"Ah, but she did!" Ransom said, with alacrity. "I thought her very\r\ncharming!"\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t you think her very reasonable?"\r\n\r\n"God forbid, madam! I consider women have no business to be reasonable."\r\n\r\nHis companion turned upon him, slowly and mildly, and each of her\r\nglasses, in her aspect of reproach, had the glitter of an enormous tear.\r\n"Do you regard us, then, simply as lovely baubles?"\r\n\r\nThe effect of this question, as coming from Miss Birdseye, and referring\r\nin some degree to her own venerable identity, was such as to move him to\r\nirresistible laughter. But he controlled himself quickly enough to say,\r\nwith genuine expression, "I regard you as the dearest thing in life, the\r\nonly thing which makes it worth living!"\r\n\r\n"Worth living for--you! But for us?" suggested Miss Birdseye.\r\n\r\n"It\'s worth any woman\'s while to be admired as I admire you. Miss\r\nTarrant, of whom we were speaking, affected me, as you say, in this\r\nway--that I think more highly still, if possible, of the sex which\r\nproduced such a delightful young lady."\r\n\r\n"Well, we think everything of her here," said Miss Birdseye. "It seems\r\nas if it were a real gift."\r\n\r\n"Does she speak often--is there any chance of my hearing her now?"\r\n\r\n"She raises her voice a good deal in the places round--like Framingham\r\nand Billerica. It seems as if she were gathering strength, just to break\r\nover Boston like a wave. In fact she did break, last summer. She is a\r\ngrowing power since her great success at the convention."\r\n\r\n"Ah! her success at the convention was very great?" Ransom inquired,\r\nputting discretion into his voice.\r\n\r\nMiss Birdseye hesitated a moment, in order to measure her response by\r\nthe bounds of righteousness. "Well," she said, with the tenderness of a\r\nlong retrospect, "I have seen nothing like it since I last listened to\r\nEliza P. Moseley."\r\n\r\n"What a pity she isn\'t speaking somewhere to-night!" Ransom exclaimed.\r\n\r\n"Oh, to-night she\'s out in Cambridge. Olive Chancellor mentioned that."\r\n\r\n"Is she making a speech there?"\r\n\r\n"No; she\'s visiting her home."\r\n\r\n"I thought her home was in Charles Street?"\r\n\r\n"Well, no; that\'s her residence--her principal one--since she became so\r\nunited to your cousin. Isn\'t Miss Chancellor your cousin?"\r\n\r\n"We don\'t insist on the relationship," said Ransom, smiling. "Are they\r\nvery much united, the two young ladies?"\r\n\r\n"You would say so if you were to see Miss Chancellor when Verena rises\r\nto eloquence. It\'s as if the chords were strung across her own heart;\r\nshe seems to vibrate, to echo with every word. It\'s a very close and\r\nvery beautiful tie, and we think everything of it here. They will work\r\ntogether for a great good!"\r\n\r\n"I hope so," Ransom remarked. "But in spite of it Miss Tarrant spends a\r\npart of her time with her father and mother."\r\n\r\n"Yes, she seems to have something for every one. If you were to see her\r\nat home, you would think she was all the daughter. She leads a lovely\r\nlife!" said Miss Birdseye.\r\n\r\n"See her at home? That\'s exactly what I want!" Ransom rejoined, feeling\r\nthat if he was to come to this he needn\'t have had scruples at first. "I\r\nhaven\'t forgotten that she invited me, when I met her."\r\n\r\n"Oh, of course she attracts many visitors," said Miss Birdseye, limiting\r\nher encouragement to this statement.\r\n\r\n"Yes; she must be used to admirers. And where, in Cambridge, do her\r\nfamily live?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, it\'s on one of those little streets that don\'t seem to have very\r\nmuch of a name. But they do call it--they do call it----" she meditated\r\naudibly.\r\n\r\nThis process was interrupted by an abrupt allocution from the conductor.\r\n"I guess you change here for _your_ place. You want one of them blue\r\ncars."\r\n\r\nThe good lady returned to a sense of the situation, and Ransom helped\r\nher out of the vehicle, with the aid, as before, of a certain amount of\r\npropulsion from the conductor. Her road branched off to the right, and\r\nshe had to wait on the corner of a street, there being as yet no blue\r\ncar within hail. The corner was quiet and the day favourable to\r\npatience--a day of relaxed rigour and intense brilliancy. It was as if\r\nthe touch of the air itself were gloved, and the street-colouring had\r\nthe richness of a superficial thaw. Ransom, of course, waited with his\r\nphilanthropic companion, though she now protested more vigorously\r\nagainst the idea that a gentleman from the South should pretend to teach\r\nan old abolitionist the mysteries of Boston. He promised to leave her\r\nwhen he should have consigned her to the blue car; and meanwhile they\r\nstood in the sun, with their backs against an apothecary\'s window, and\r\nshe tried again, at his suggestion, to remember the name of Doctor\r\nTarrant\'s street. "I guess if you ask for Doctor Tarrant, any one can\r\ntell you," she said; and then suddenly the address came to her--the\r\nresidence of the mesmeric healer was in Monadnoc Place.\r\n\r\n"But you\'ll have to ask for that, so it comes to the same," she went on.\r\nAfter this she added, with a friendliness more personal, "Ain\'t you\r\ngoing to see your cousin too?"\r\n\r\n"Not if I can help it!"\r\n\r\nMiss Birdseye gave a little ineffectual sigh. "Well, I suppose every one\r\nmust act out their ideal. That\'s what Olive Chancellor does. She\'s a\r\nvery noble character."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, a glorious nature."\r\n\r\n"You know their opinions are just the same--hers and Verena\'s," Miss\r\nBirdseye placidly continued. "So why should you make a distinction?"\r\n\r\n"My dear madam," said Ransom, "does a woman consist of nothing but her\r\nopinions? I like Miss Tarrant\'s lovely face better, to begin with."\r\n\r\n"Well, she _is_ pretty-looking." And Miss Birdseye gave another sigh, as\r\nif she had had a theory submitted to her--that one about a lady\'s\r\nopinions--which, with all that was unfamiliar and peculiar lying behind\r\nit, she was really too old to look into much. It might have been the\r\nfirst time she really felt her age. "There\'s a blue car," she said, in a\r\ntone of mild relief.\r\n\r\n"It will be some moments before it gets here. Moreover, I don\'t believe\r\nthat at bottom they _are_ Miss Tarrant\'s opinions," Ransom added.\r\n\r\n"You mustn\'t think she hasn\'t a strong hold of them," his companion\r\nexclaimed, more briskly. "If you think she is not sincere, you are very\r\nmuch mistaken. Those views are just her life."\r\n\r\n"Well, _she_ may bring me round to them," said Ransom, smiling.\r\n\r\nMiss Birdseye had been watching her blue car, the advance of which was\r\ntemporarily obstructed. At this, she transferred her eyes to him, gazing\r\nat him solemnly out of the pervasive window of her spectacles. "Well, I\r\nshouldn\'t wonder if she did! Yes, that will be a good thing. I don\'t see\r\nhow you can help being a good deal shaken by her. She has acted on so\r\nmany."\r\n\r\n"I see: no doubt she will act on me." Then it occurred to Ransom to add:\r\n"By the way, Miss Birdseye, perhaps you will be so kind as not to\r\nmention this meeting of ours to my cousin, in case of your seeing her\r\nagain. I have a perfectly good conscience in not calling upon her, but I\r\nshouldn\'t like her to think that I announced my slighting intention all\r\nover the town. I don\'t want to offend her, and she had better not know\r\nthat I have been in Boston. If you don\'t tell her, no one else will."\r\n\r\n"Do you wish me to conceal----?" murmured Miss Birdseye, panting a\r\nlittle.\r\n\r\n"No, I don\'t want you to conceal anything. I only want you to let this\r\nincident pass--to say nothing."\r\n\r\n"Well, I never did anything of that kind."\r\n\r\n"Of what kind?" Ransom was half vexed, half touched by her inability to\r\nenter into his point of view, and her resistance made him hold to his\r\nidea the more. "It is very simple, what I ask of you. You are under no\r\nobligation to tell Miss Chancellor everything that happens to you, are\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\nHis request seemed still something of a shock to the poor old lady\'s\r\ncandour. "Well, I see her very often, and we talk a great deal. And\r\nthen--won\'t Verena tell her?"\r\n\r\n"I have thought of that--but I hope not."\r\n\r\n"She tells her most everything. Their union is so close."\r\n\r\n"She won\'t want her to be wounded," Ransom said ingeniously.\r\n\r\n"Well, you _are_ considerate." And Miss Birdseye continued to gaze at\r\nhim. "It\'s a pity you can\'t sympathise."\r\n\r\n"As I tell you, perhaps Miss Tarrant will bring me round. You have\r\nbefore you a possible convert," Ransom went on, without, I fear, putting\r\nup the least little prayer to heaven that his dishonesty might be\r\nforgiven.\r\n\r\n"I should be very happy to think that--after I have told you her address\r\nin this secret way." A smile of infinite mildness glimmered in Miss\r\nBirdseye\'s face, and she added: "Well, I guess that will be your fate.\r\nShe _has_ affected so many. I would keep very quiet if I thought that.\r\nYes, she will bring you round."\r\n\r\n"I will let you know as soon as she does," Basil Ransom said. "Here is\r\nyour car at last."\r\n\r\n"Well, I believe in the victory of the truth. I won\'t say anything." And\r\nshe suffered the young man to lead her to the car, which had now stopped\r\nat their corner.\r\n\r\n"I hope very much I shall see you again," he remarked, as they went.\r\n\r\n"Well, I am always round the streets, in Boston." And while, lifting and\r\npushing, he was helping again to insert her into the oblong receptacle,\r\nshe turned a little and repeated, "She _will_ affect you! If that\'s to\r\nbe your secret, I will keep it," Ransom heard her subjoin. He raised his\r\nhat and waved her a farewell, but she didn\'t see him; she was squeezing\r\nfurther into the car and making the discovery that this time it was full\r\nand there was no seat for her. Surely, however, he said to himself,\r\nevery man in the place would offer his own to such an innocent old dear.\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF VOL.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\r\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\r\nbusiness@pglaf.org.

Newby\r\n     Chief Executive and Director\r\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
