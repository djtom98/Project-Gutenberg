Here the trees, timber or\r\nfruit-bearing, as the case may be, make the wayside hedges ragged by\r\ntheir drip and shade, stretching over the road with easeful\r\nhorizontality, as if they found the unsubstantial air an adequate\r\nsupport for their limbs. At one place, where a hill is crossed, the\r\nlargest of the woods shows itself bisected by the high-way, as the head\r\nof thick hair is bisected by the white line of its parting. The spot is\r\nlonely.\r\n\r\nThe physiognomy of a deserted highway expresses solitude to a degree\r\nthat is not reached by mere dales or downs, and bespeaks a tomb-like\r\nstillness more emphatic than that of glades and pools. The contrast of\r\nwhat is with what might be probably accounts for this. To step, for\r\ninstance, at the place under notice, from the hedge of the plantation\r\ninto the adjoining pale thoroughfare, and pause amid its emptiness for\r\na moment, was to exchange by the act of a single stride the simple\r\nabsence of human companionship for an incubus of the forlorn.\r\n\r\nAt this spot, on the lowering evening of a by-gone winter\xe2\x80\x99s day, there\r\nstood a man who had entered upon the scene much in the aforesaid\r\nmanner. Alighting into the road from a stile hard by, he, though by no\r\nmeans a \xe2\x80\x9cchosen vessel\xe2\x80\x9d for impressions, was temporarily influenced by\r\nsome such feeling of being suddenly more alone than before he had\r\nemerged upon the highway.\r\n\r\nIt could be seen by a glance at his rather finical style of dress that\r\nhe did not belong to the country proper; and from his air, after a\r\nwhile, that though there might be a sombre beauty in the scenery, music\r\nin the breeze, and a wan procession of coaching ghosts in the sentiment\r\nof this old turnpike-road, he was mainly puzzled about the way. The\r\ndead men\xe2\x80\x99s work that had been expended in climbing that hill, the\r\nblistered soles that had trodden it, and the tears that had wetted it,\r\nwere not his concern; for fate had given him no time for any but\r\npractical things.\r\n\r\nHe looked north and south, and mechanically prodded the ground with his\r\nwalking-stick. A closer glance at his face corroborated the testimony\r\nof his clothes. It was self-complacent, yet there was small apparent\r\nground for such complacence. Nothing irradiated it; to the eye of the\r\nmagician in character, if not to the ordinary observer, the expression\r\nenthroned there was absolute submission to and belief in a little\r\nassortment of forms and habitudes.\r\n\r\nAt first not a soul appeared who could enlighten him as he desired, or\r\nseemed likely to appear that night. But presently a slight noise of\r\nlaboring wheels and the steady dig of a horse\xe2\x80\x99s shoe-tips became\r\naudible; and there loomed in the notch of the hill and plantation that\r\nthe road formed here at the summit a carrier\xe2\x80\x99s van drawn by a single\r\nhorse. When it got nearer, he said, with some relief to himself, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis\r\nMrs. Dollery\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94this will help me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe vehicle was half full of passengers, mostly women. He held up his\r\nstick at its approach, and the woman who was driving drew rein.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been trying to find a short way to Little Hintock this last\r\nhalf-hour, Mrs. Dollery,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut though I\xe2\x80\x99ve been to Great\r\nHintock and Hintock House half a dozen times I am at fault about the\r\nsmall village. You can help me, I dare say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe assured him that she could\xe2\x80\x94that as she went to Great Hintock her\r\nvan passed near it\xe2\x80\x94that it was only up the lane that branched out of\r\nthe lane into which she was about to turn\xe2\x80\x94just ahead. \xe2\x80\x9cThough,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncontinued Mrs. Dollery, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99tis such a little small place that, as a town\r\ngentleman, you\xe2\x80\x99d need have a candle and lantern to find it if ye don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow where \xe2\x80\x99tis. Bedad! I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t live there if they\xe2\x80\x99d pay me to. Now\r\nat Great Hintock you do see the world a bit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe mounted and sat beside her, with his feet outside, where they were\r\never and anon brushed over by the horse\xe2\x80\x99s tail.\r\n\r\nThis van, driven and owned by Mrs. Dollery, was rather a movable\r\nattachment of the roadway than an extraneous object, to those who knew\r\nit well. The old horse, whose hair was of the roughness and color of\r\nheather, whose leg-joints, shoulders, and hoofs were distorted by\r\nharness and drudgery from colthood\xe2\x80\x94though if all had their rights, he\r\nought, symmetrical in outline, to have been picking the herbage of some\r\nEastern plain instead of tugging here\xe2\x80\x94had trodden this road almost\r\ndaily for twenty years. Even his subjection was not made congruous\r\nthroughout, for the harness being too short, his tail was not drawn\r\nthrough the crupper, so that the breeching slipped awkwardly to one\r\nside. He knew every subtle incline of the seven or eight miles of\r\nground between Hintock and Sherton Abbas\xe2\x80\x94the market-town to which he\r\njourneyed\xe2\x80\x94as accurately as any surveyor could have learned it by a\r\nDumpy level.\r\n\r\nThe vehicle had a square black tilt which nodded with the motion of the\r\nwheels, and at a point in it over the driver\xe2\x80\x99s head was a hook to which\r\nthe reins were hitched at times, when they formed a catenary curve from\r\nthe horse\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders. Somewhere about the axles was a loose chain,\r\nwhose only known purpose was to clink as it went. Mrs. Dollery, having\r\nto hop up and down many times in the service of her passengers, wore,\r\nespecially in windy weather, short leggings under her gown for\r\nmodesty\xe2\x80\x99s sake, and instead of a bonnet a felt hat tied down with a\r\nhandkerchief, to guard against an earache to which she was frequently\r\nsubject. In the rear of the van was a glass window, which she cleaned\r\nwith her pocket-handkerchief every market-day before starting. Looking\r\nat the van from the back, the spectator could thus see through its\r\ninterior a square piece of the same sky and landscape that he saw\r\nwithout, but intruded on by the profiles of the seated passengers, who,\r\nas they rumbled onward, their lips moving and heads nodding in animated\r\nprivate converse, remained in happy unconsciousness that their\r\nmannerisms and facial peculiarities were sharply defined to the public\r\neye.\r\n\r\nThis hour of coming home from market was the happy one, if not the\r\nhappiest, of the week for them. Snugly ensconced under the tilt, they\r\ncould forget the sorrows of the world without, and survey life and\r\nrecapitulate the incidents of the day with placid smiles.\r\n\r\nThe passengers in the back part formed a group to themselves, and while\r\nthe new-comer spoke to the proprietress, they indulged in a\r\nconfidential chat about him as about other people, which the noise of\r\nthe van rendered inaudible to himself and Mrs. Dollery, sitting\r\nforward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis Barber Percombe\xe2\x80\x94he that\xe2\x80\x99s got the waxen woman in his window at\r\nthe top of Abbey Street,\xe2\x80\x9d said one. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat business can bring him from\r\nhis shop out here at this time and not a journeyman hair-cutter, but a\r\nmaster-barber that\xe2\x80\x99s left off his pole because \xe2\x80\x99tis not genteel!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey listened to his conversation, but Mr. Percombe, though he had\r\nnodded and spoken genially, seemed indisposed to gratify the curiosity\r\nwhich he had aroused; and the unrestrained flow of ideas which had\r\nanimated the inside of the van before his arrival was checked\r\nthenceforward.\r\n\r\nThus they rode on till they turned into a half-invisible little lane,\r\nwhence, as it reached the verge of an eminence, could be discerned in\r\nthe dusk, about half a mile to the right, gardens and orchards sunk in\r\na concave, and, as it were, snipped out of the woodland. From this\r\nself-contained place rose in stealthy silence tall stems of smoke,\r\nwhich the eye of imagination could trace downward to their root on\r\nquiet hearth-stones festooned overhead with hams and flitches. It was\r\none of those sequestered spots outside the gates of the world where may\r\nusually be found more meditation than action, and more passivity than\r\nmeditation; where reasoning proceeds on narrow premises, and results in\r\ninferences wildly imaginative; yet where, from time to time, no less\r\nthan in other places, dramas of a grandeur and unity truly Sophoclean\r\nare enacted in the real, by virtue of the concentrated passions and\r\nclosely knit interdependence of the lives therein.\r\n\r\nThis place was the Little Hintock of the master-barber\xe2\x80\x99s search. The\r\ncoming night gradually obscured the smoke of the chimneys, but the\r\nposition of the sequestered little world could still be distinguished\r\nby a few faint lights, winking more or less ineffectually through the\r\nleafless boughs, and the undiscerned songsters they bore, in the form\r\nof balls of feathers, at roost among them.\r\n\r\nOut of the lane followed by the van branched a yet smaller lane, at the\r\ncorner of which the barber alighted, Mrs. Dollery\xe2\x80\x99s van going on to the\r\nlarger village, whose superiority to the despised smaller one as an\r\nexemplar of the world\xe2\x80\x99s movements was not particularly apparent in its\r\nmeans of approach.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA very clever and learned young doctor, who, they say, is in league\r\nwith the devil, lives in the place you be going to\xe2\x80\x94not because there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nanybody for\xe2\x80\x99n to cure there, but because \xe2\x80\x99tis the middle of his\r\ndistrict.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe observation was flung at the barber by one of the women at parting,\r\nas a last attempt to get at his errand that way.\r\n\r\nBut he made no reply, and without further pause the pedestrian plunged\r\ntowards the umbrageous nook, and paced cautiously over the dead leaves\r\nwhich nearly buried the road or street of the hamlet. As very few\r\npeople except themselves passed this way after dark, a majority of the\r\ndenizens of Little Hintock deemed window-curtains unnecessary; and on\r\nthis account Mr. Percombe made it his business to stop opposite the\r\ncasements of each cottage that he came to, with a demeanor which showed\r\nthat he was endeavoring to conjecture, from the persons and things he\r\nobserved within, the whereabouts of somebody or other who resided here.\r\n\r\nOnly the smaller dwellings interested him; one or two houses, whose\r\nsize, antiquity, and rambling appurtenances signified that\r\nnotwithstanding their remoteness they must formerly have been, if they\r\nwere not still, inhabited by people of a certain social standing, being\r\nneglected by him entirely. Smells of pomace, and the hiss of fermenting\r\ncider, which reached him from the back quarters of other tenements,\r\nrevealed the recent occupation of some of the inhabitants, and joined\r\nwith the scent of decay from the perishing leaves underfoot.\r\n\r\nHalf a dozen dwellings were passed without result. The next, which\r\nstood opposite a tall tree, was in an exceptional state of radiance,\r\nthe flickering brightness from the inside shining up the chimney and\r\nmaking a luminous mist of the emerging smoke. The interior, as seen\r\nthrough the window, caused him to draw up with a terminative air and\r\nwatch. The house was rather large for a cottage, and the door, which\r\nopened immediately into the living-room, stood ajar, so that a ribbon\r\nof light fell through the opening into the dark atmosphere without.\r\nEvery now and then a moth, decrepit from the late season, would flit\r\nfor a moment across the out-coming rays and disappear again into the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the room from which this cheerful blaze proceeded, he beheld a girl\r\nseated on a willow chair, and busily occupied by the light of the fire,\r\nwhich was ample and of wood. With a bill-hook in one hand and a leather\r\nglove, much too large for her, on the other, she was making spars, such\r\nas are used by thatchers, with great rapidity. She wore a leather apron\r\nfor this purpose, which was also much too large for her figure. On her\r\nleft hand lay a bundle of the straight, smooth sticks called\r\nspar-gads\xe2\x80\x94the raw material of her manufacture; on her right, a heap of\r\nchips and ends\xe2\x80\x94the refuse\xe2\x80\x94with which the fire was maintained; in front,\r\na pile of the finished articles. To produce them she took up each gad,\r\nlooked critically at it from end to end, cut it to length, split it\r\ninto four, and sharpened each of the quarters with dexterous blows,\r\nwhich brought it to a triangular point precisely resembling that of a\r\nbayonet.\r\n\r\nBeside her, in case she might require more light, a brass candlestick\r\nstood on a little round table, curiously formed of an old coffin-stool,\r\nwith a deal top nailed on, the white surface of the latter contrasting\r\noddly with the black carved oak of the substructure. The social\r\nposition of the household in the past was almost as definitively shown\r\nby the presence of this article as that of an esquire or nobleman by\r\nhis old helmets or shields. It had been customary for every well-to-do\r\nvillager, whose tenure was by copy of court-roll, or in any way more\r\npermanent than that of the mere cotter, to keep a pair of these stools\r\nfor the use of his own dead; but for the last generation or two a\r\nfeeling of cui bono had led to the discontinuance of the custom, and\r\nthe stools were frequently made use of in the manner described.\r\n\r\nThe young woman laid down the bill-hook for a moment and examined the\r\npalm of her right hand, which, unlike the other, was ungloved, and\r\nshowed little hardness or roughness about it. The palm was red and\r\nblistering, as if this present occupation were not frequent enough with\r\nher to subdue it to what it worked in. As with so many right hands born\r\nto manual labor, there was nothing in its fundamental shape to bear out\r\nthe physiological conventionalism that gradations of birth, gentle or\r\nmean, show themselves primarily in the form of this member. Nothing but\r\na cast of the die of destiny had decided that the girl should handle\r\nthe tool; and the fingers which clasped the heavy ash haft might have\r\nskilfully guided the pencil or swept the string, had they only been set\r\nto do it in good time.\r\n\r\nHer face had the usual fulness of expression which is developed by a\r\nlife of solitude. Where the eyes of a multitude beat like waves upon a\r\ncountenance they seem to wear away its individuality; but in the still\r\nwater of privacy every tentacle of feeling and sentiment shoots out in\r\nvisible luxuriance, to be interpreted as readily as a child\xe2\x80\x99s look by\r\nan intruder. In years she was no more than nineteen or twenty, but the\r\nnecessity of taking thought at a too early period of life had forced\r\nthe provisional curves of her childhood\xe2\x80\x99s face to a premature finality.\r\nThus she had but little pretension to beauty, save in one prominent\r\nparticular\xe2\x80\x94her hair. Its abundance made it almost unmanageable; its\r\ncolor was, roughly speaking, and as seen here by firelight, brown, but\r\ncareful notice, or an observation by day, would have revealed that its\r\ntrue shade was a rare and beautiful approximation to chestnut.\r\n\r\nOn this one bright gift of Time to the particular victim of his now\r\nbefore us the new-comer\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were fixed; meanwhile the fingers of his\r\nright hand mechanically played over something sticking up from his\r\nwaistcoat-pocket\xe2\x80\x94the bows of a pair of scissors, whose polish made them\r\nfeebly responsive to the light within. In her present beholder\xe2\x80\x99s mind\r\nthe scene formed by the girlish spar-maker composed itself into a\r\npost-Raffaelite picture of extremest quality, wherein the girl\xe2\x80\x99s hair\r\nalone, as the focus of observation, was depicted with intensity and\r\ndistinctness, and her face, shoulders, hands, and figure in general,\r\nbeing a blurred mass of unimportant detail lost in haze and obscurity.\r\n\r\nHe hesitated no longer, but tapped at the door and entered. The young\r\nwoman turned at the crunch of his boots on the sanded floor, and\r\nexclaiming, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Mr. Percombe, how you frightened me!\xe2\x80\x9d quite lost her\r\ncolor for a moment.\r\n\r\nHe replied, \xe2\x80\x9cYou should shut your door\xe2\x80\x94then you\xe2\x80\x99d hear folk open it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cthe chimney smokes so. Mr. Percombe, you look as\r\nunnatural out of your shop as a canary in a thorn-hedge. Surely you\r\nhave not come out here on my account\xe2\x80\x94for\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94to have your answer about this.\xe2\x80\x9d He touched her head with his\r\ncane, and she winced. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you agree?\xe2\x80\x9d he continued. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is necessary\r\nthat I should know at once, as the lady is soon going away, and it\r\ntakes time to make up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t press me\xe2\x80\x94it worries me. I was in hopes you had thought no more\r\nof it. I can _not_ part with it\xe2\x80\x94so there!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, look here, Marty,\xe2\x80\x9d said the barber, sitting down on the\r\ncoffin-stool table. \xe2\x80\x9cHow much do you get for making these spars?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush\xe2\x80\x94father\xe2\x80\x99s up-stairs awake, and he don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I am doing his\r\nwork.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, now tell me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man, more softly. \xe2\x80\x9cHow much do you get?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEighteenpence a thousand,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, reluctantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho are you making them for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Melbury, the timber-dealer, just below here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how many can you make in a day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn a day and half the night, three bundles\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s a thousand and a\r\nhalf.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo and threepence.\xe2\x80\x9d The barber paused. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, look here,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncontinued, with the remains of a calculation in his tone, which\r\ncalculation had been the reduction to figures of the probable monetary\r\nmagnetism necessary to overpower the resistant force of her present\r\npurse and the woman\xe2\x80\x99s love of comeliness, \xe2\x80\x9chere\xe2\x80\x99s a sovereign\xe2\x80\x94a gold\r\nsovereign, almost new.\xe2\x80\x9d He held it out between his finger and thumb.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s as much as you\xe2\x80\x99d earn in a week and a half at that rough man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwork, and it\xe2\x80\x99s yours for just letting me snip off what you\xe2\x80\x99ve got too\r\nmuch of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl\xe2\x80\x99s bosom moved a very little. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy can\xe2\x80\x99t the lady send to some\r\nother girl who don\xe2\x80\x99t value her hair\xe2\x80\x94not to me?\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, simpleton, because yours is the exact shade of her own, and \xe2\x80\x99tis\r\na shade you can\xe2\x80\x99t match by dyeing. But you are not going to refuse me\r\nnow I\xe2\x80\x99ve come all the way from Sherton o\xe2\x80\x99 purpose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say I won\xe2\x80\x99t sell it\xe2\x80\x94to you or anybody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow listen,\xe2\x80\x9d and he drew up a little closer beside her. \xe2\x80\x9cThe lady is\r\nvery rich, and won\xe2\x80\x99t be particular to a few shillings; so I will\r\nadvance to this on my own responsibility\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll make the one sovereign\r\ntwo, rather than go back empty-handed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, no!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, beginning to be much agitated. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are\r\na-tempting me, Mr. Percombe. You go on like the Devil to Dr. Faustus in\r\nthe penny book. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t want your money, and won\xe2\x80\x99t agree. Why did\r\nyou come? I said when you got me into your shop and urged me so much,\r\nthat I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to sell my hair!\xe2\x80\x9d The speaker was hot and stern.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarty, now hearken. The lady that wants it wants it badly. And,\r\nbetween you and me, you\xe2\x80\x99d better let her have it. \xe2\x80\x99Twill be bad for you\r\nif you don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBad for me? Who is she, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe barber held his tongue, and the girl repeated the question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not at liberty to tell you. And as she is going abroad soon it\r\nmakes no difference who she is at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe wants it to go abroad wi\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPercombe assented by a nod. The girl regarded him reflectively. \xe2\x80\x9cBarber\r\nPercombe,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI know who \xe2\x80\x99tis. \xe2\x80\x99Tis she at the House\xe2\x80\x94Mrs.\r\nCharmond!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s my secret. However, if you agree to let me have it, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell\r\nyou in confidence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll certainly not let you have it unless you tell me the truth. It is\r\nMrs. Charmond.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe barber dropped his voice. \xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94it is. You sat in front of her in\r\nchurch the other day, and she noticed how exactly your hair matched her\r\nown. Ever since then she\xe2\x80\x99s been hankering for it, and at last decided\r\nto get it. As she won\xe2\x80\x99t wear it till she goes off abroad, she knows\r\nnobody will recognize the change. I\xe2\x80\x99m commissioned to get it for her,\r\nand then it is to be made up. I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have vamped all these miles\r\nfor any less important employer. Now, mind\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99tis as much as my business\r\nwith her is worth if it should be known that I\xe2\x80\x99ve let out her name; but\r\nhonor between us two, Marty, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll say nothing that would injure\r\nme?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to tell upon her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marty, coolly. \xe2\x80\x9cBut my hair is my\r\nown, and I\xe2\x80\x99m going to keep it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, that\xe2\x80\x99s not fair, after what I\xe2\x80\x99ve told you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the nettled\r\nbarber. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see, Marty, as you are in the same parish, and in one of\r\nher cottages, and your father is ill, and wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like to turn out, it\r\nwould be as well to oblige her. I say that as a friend. But I won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\npress you to make up your mind to-night. You\xe2\x80\x99ll be coming to market\r\nto-morrow, I dare say, and you can call then. If you think it over\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll be inclined to bring what I want, I know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve nothing more to say,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered.\r\n\r\nHer companion saw from her manner that it was useless to urge her\r\nfurther by speech. \xe2\x80\x9cAs you are a trusty young woman,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nput these sovereigns up here for ornament, that you may see how\r\nhandsome they are. Bring the hair to-morrow, or return the sovereigns.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHe stuck them edgewise into the frame of a small mantle looking-glass.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll bring it, for your sake and mine. I should have thought\r\nshe could have suited herself elsewhere; but as it\xe2\x80\x99s her fancy it must\r\nbe indulged if possible. If you cut it off yourself, mind how you do it\r\nso as to keep all the locks one way.\xe2\x80\x9d He showed her how this was to be\r\ndone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I sha\xe2\x80\x99nt,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, with laconic indifference. \xe2\x80\x9cI value my\r\nlooks too much to spoil \xe2\x80\x99em. She wants my hair to get another lover\r\nwith; though if stories are true she\xe2\x80\x99s broke the heart of many a noble\r\ngentleman already.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord, it\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful how you guess things, Marty,\xe2\x80\x9d said the barber.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve had it from them that know that there certainly is some foreign\r\ngentleman in her eye. However, mind what I ask.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s not going to get him through me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPercombe had retired as far as the door; he came back, planted his cane\r\non the coffin-stool, and looked her in the face. \xe2\x80\x9cMarty South,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, with deliberate emphasis, \xe2\x80\x9c_you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a lover yourself_, and\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s why you won\xe2\x80\x99t let it go!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe reddened so intensely as to pass the mild blush that suffices to\r\nheighten beauty; she put the yellow leather glove on one hand, took up\r\nthe hook with the other, and sat down doggedly to her work without\r\nturning her face to him again. He regarded her head for a moment, went\r\nto the door, and with one look back at her, departed on his way\r\nhomeward.\r\n\r\nMarty pursued her occupation for a few minutes, then suddenly laying\r\ndown the bill-hook, she jumped up and went to the back of the room,\r\nwhere she opened a door which disclosed a staircase so whitely scrubbed\r\nthat the grain of the wood was wellnigh sodden away by such cleansing.\r\nAt the top she gently approached a bedroom, and without entering, said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather, do you want anything?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA weak voice inside answered in the negative; adding, \xe2\x80\x9cI should be all\r\nright by to-morrow if it were not for the tree!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe tree again\xe2\x80\x94always the tree! Oh, father, don\xe2\x80\x99t worry so about that.\r\nYou know it can do you no harm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho have ye had talking to ye down-stairs?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA Sherton man called\xe2\x80\x94nothing to trouble about,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, soothingly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, \xe2\x80\x9ccan Mrs. Charmond turn us out of our house if\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s minded to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTurn us out? No. Nobody can turn us out till my poor soul is turned\r\nout of my body. \xe2\x80\x99Tis life-hold, like Ambrose Winterborne\xe2\x80\x99s. But when my\r\nlife drops \xe2\x80\x99twill be hers\xe2\x80\x94not till then.\xe2\x80\x9d His words on this subject so\r\nfar had been rational and firm enough. But now he lapsed into his\r\nmoaning strain: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd the tree will do it\xe2\x80\x94that tree will soon be the\r\ndeath of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense, you know better. How can it be?\xe2\x80\x9d She refrained from further\r\nspeech, and descended to the ground-floor again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank Heaven, then,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to herself, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat belongs to me I keep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe lights in the village went out, house after house, till there only\r\nremained two in the darkness. One of these came from a residence on the\r\nhill-side, of which there is nothing to say at present; the other shone\r\nfrom the window of Marty South. Precisely the same outward effect was\r\nproduced here, however, by her rising when the clock struck ten and\r\nhanging up a thick cloth curtain. The door it was necessary to keep\r\najar in hers, as in most cottages, because of the smoke; but she\r\nobviated the effect of the ribbon of light through the chink by hanging\r\na cloth over that also. She was one of those people who, if they have\r\nto work harder than their neighbors, prefer to keep the necessity a\r\nsecret as far as possible; and but for the slight sounds of\r\nwood-splintering which came from within, no wayfarer would have\r\nperceived that here the cottager did not sleep as elsewhere.\r\n\r\nEleven, twelve, one o\xe2\x80\x99clock struck; the heap of spars grew higher, and\r\nthe pile of chips and ends more bulky. Even the light on the hill had\r\nnow been extinguished; but still she worked on. When the temperature of\r\nthe night without had fallen so low as to make her chilly, she opened a\r\nlarge blue umbrella to ward off the draught from the door. The two\r\nsovereigns confronted her from the looking-glass in such a manner as to\r\nsuggest a pair of jaundiced eyes on the watch for an opportunity.\r\nWhenever she sighed for weariness she lifted her gaze towards them, but\r\nwithdrew it quickly, stroking her tresses with her fingers for a\r\nmoment, as if to assure herself that they were still secure. When the\r\nclock struck three she arose and tied up the spars she had last made in\r\na bundle resembling those that lay against the wall.\r\n\r\nShe wrapped round her a long red woollen cravat and opened the door.\r\nThe night in all its fulness met her flatly on the threshold, like the\r\nvery brink of an absolute void, or the antemundane Ginnung-Gap believed\r\nin by her Teuton forefathers. For her eyes were fresh from the blaze,\r\nand here there was no street-lamp or lantern to form a kindly\r\ntransition between the inner glare and the outer dark. A lingering wind\r\nbrought to her ear the creaking sound of two over-crowded branches in\r\nthe neighboring wood which were rubbing each other into wounds, and\r\nother vocalized sorrows of the trees, together with the screech of\r\nowls, and the fluttering tumble of some awkward wood-pigeon\r\nill-balanced on its roosting-bough.\r\n\r\nBut the pupils of her young eyes soon expanded, and she could see well\r\nenough for her purpose. Taking a bundle of spars under each arm, and\r\nguided by the serrated line of tree-tops against the sky, she went some\r\nhundred yards or more down the lane till she reached a long open shed,\r\ncarpeted around with the dead leaves that lay about everywhere. Night,\r\nthat strange personality, which within walls brings ominous\r\nintrospectiveness and self-distrust, but under the open sky banishes\r\nsuch subjective anxieties as too trivial for thought, inspired Marty\r\nSouth with a less perturbed and brisker manner now. She laid the spars\r\non the ground within the shed and returned for more, going to and fro\r\ntill her whole manufactured stock were deposited here.\r\n\r\nThis erection was the wagon-house of the chief man of business\r\nhereabout, Mr. George Melbury, the timber, bark, and copse-ware\r\nmerchant for whom Marty\xe2\x80\x99s father did work of this sort by the piece. It\r\nformed one of the many rambling out-houses which surrounded his\r\ndwelling, an equally irregular block of building, whose immense\r\nchimneys could just be discerned even now. The four huge wagons under\r\nthe shed were built on those ancient lines whose proportions have been\r\nousted by modern patterns, their shapes bulging and curving at the base\r\nand ends like Trafalgar line-of-battle ships, with which venerable\r\nhulks, indeed, these vehicles evidenced a constructed spirit curiously\r\nin harmony. One was laden with sheep-cribs, another with hurdles,\r\nanother with ash poles, and the fourth, at the foot of which she had\r\nplaced her thatching-spars was half full of similar bundles.\r\n\r\nShe was pausing a moment with that easeful sense of accomplishment\r\nwhich follows work done that has been a hard struggle in the doing,\r\nwhen she heard a woman\xe2\x80\x99s voice on the other side of the hedge say,\r\nanxiously, \xe2\x80\x9cGeorge!\xe2\x80\x9d In a moment the name was repeated, with \xe2\x80\x9cDo come\r\nindoors! What are you doing there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe cart-house adjoined the garden, and before Marty had moved she saw\r\nenter the latter from the timber-merchant\xe2\x80\x99s back door an elderly woman\r\nsheltering a candle with her hand, the light from which cast a moving\r\nthorn-pattern of shade on Marty\xe2\x80\x99s face. Its rays soon fell upon a man\r\nwhose clothes were roughly thrown on, standing in advance of the\r\nspeaker. He was a thin, slightly stooping figure, with a small nervous\r\nmouth and a face cleanly shaven; and he walked along the path with his\r\neyes bent on the ground. In the pair Marty South recognized her\r\nemployer Melbury and his wife. She was the second Mrs. Melbury, the\r\nfirst having died shortly after the birth of the timber-merchant\xe2\x80\x99s only\r\nchild.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis no use to stay in bed,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as soon as she came up to where\r\nhe was pacing restlessly about. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t sleep\xe2\x80\x94I keep thinking of\r\nthings, and worrying about the girl, till I\xe2\x80\x99m quite in a fever of\r\nanxiety.\xe2\x80\x9d He went on to say that he could not think why \xe2\x80\x9cshe (Marty\r\nknew he was speaking of his daughter) did not answer his letter. She\r\nmust be ill\xe2\x80\x94she must, certainly,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no. \xe2\x80\x99Tis all right, George,\xe2\x80\x9d said his wife; and she assured him\r\nthat such things always did appear so gloomy in the night-time, if\r\npeople allowed their minds to run on them; that when morning came it\r\nwas seen that such fears were nothing but shadows. \xe2\x80\x9cGrace is as well as\r\nyou or I,\xe2\x80\x9d she declared.\r\n\r\nBut he persisted that she did not see all\xe2\x80\x94that she did not see as much\r\nas he. His daughter\xe2\x80\x99s not writing was only one part of his worry. On\r\naccount of her he was anxious concerning money affairs, which he would\r\nnever alarm his mind about otherwise. The reason he gave was that, as\r\nshe had nobody to depend upon for a provision but himself, he wished\r\nher, when he was gone, to be securely out of risk of poverty.\r\n\r\nTo this Mrs. Melbury replied that Grace would be sure to marry well,\r\nand that hence a hundred pounds more or less from him would not make\r\nmuch difference.\r\n\r\nHer husband said that that was what she, Mrs. Melbury, naturally\r\nthought; but there she was wrong, and in that lay the source of his\r\ntrouble. \xe2\x80\x9cI have a plan in my head about her,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cand according\r\nto my plan she won\xe2\x80\x99t marry a rich man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA plan for her not to marry well?\xe2\x80\x9d said his wife, surprised.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, in one sense it is that,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Melbury. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a plan for her\r\nto marry a particular person, and as he has not so much money as she\r\nmight expect, it might be called as you call it. I may not be able to\r\ncarry it out; and even if I do, it may not be a good thing for her. I\r\nwant her to marry Giles Winterborne.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis companion repeated the name. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, it is all right,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\npresently. \xe2\x80\x9cHe adores the very ground she walks on; only he\xe2\x80\x99s close,\r\nand won\xe2\x80\x99t show it much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarty South appeared startled, and could not tear herself away.\r\n\r\nYes, the timber-merchant asserted, he knew that well enough.\r\nWinterborne had been interested in his daughter for years; that was\r\nwhat had led him into the notion of their union. And he knew that she\r\nused to have no objection to him. But it was not any difficulty about\r\nthat which embarrassed him. It was that, since he had educated her so\r\nwell, and so long, and so far above the level of daughters thereabout,\r\nit was _wasting her_ to give her to a man of no higher standing than\r\nthe young man in question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what I have been thinking,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Melbury.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, Lucy, now you\xe2\x80\x99ve hit it,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the timber-merchant,\r\nwith feeling. \xe2\x80\x9cThere lies my trouble. I vowed to let her marry him, and\r\nto make her as valuable as I could to him by schooling her as many\r\nyears and as thoroughly as possible. I mean to keep my vow. I made it\r\nbecause I did his father a terrible wrong; and it was a weight on my\r\nconscience ever since that time till this scheme of making amends\r\noccurred to me through seeing that Giles liked her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWronged his father?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs. Melbury.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, grievously wronged him,\xe2\x80\x9d said her husband.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, don\xe2\x80\x99t think of it to-night,\xe2\x80\x9d she urged. \xe2\x80\x9cCome indoors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, the air cools my head. I shall not stay long.\xe2\x80\x9d He was silent a\r\nwhile; then he told her, as nearly as Marty could gather, that his\r\nfirst wife, his daughter Grace\xe2\x80\x99s mother, was first the sweetheart of\r\nWinterborne\xe2\x80\x99s father, who loved her tenderly, till he, the speaker, won\r\nher away from him by a trick, because he wanted to marry her himself.\r\nHe sadly went on to say that the other man\xe2\x80\x99s happiness was ruined by\r\nit; that though he married Winterborne\xe2\x80\x99s mother, it was but a\r\nhalf-hearted business with him. Melbury added that he was afterwards\r\nvery miserable at what he had done; but that as time went on, and the\r\nchildren grew up, and seemed to be attached to each other, he\r\ndetermined to do all he could to right the wrong by letting his\r\ndaughter marry the lad; not only that, but to give her the best\r\neducation he could afford, so as to make the gift as valuable a one as\r\nit lay in his power to bestow. \xe2\x80\x9cI still mean to do it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Melbury.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen do,\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut all these things trouble me,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cfor I feel I am\r\nsacrificing her for my own sin; and I think of her, and often come down\r\nhere and look at this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at what?\xe2\x80\x9d asked his wife.\r\n\r\nHe took the candle from her hand, held it to the ground, and removed a\r\ntile which lay in the garden-path. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis the track of her shoe that she\r\nmade when she ran down here the day before she went away all those\r\nmonths ago. I covered it up when she was gone; and when I come here and\r\nlook at it, I ask myself again, why should she be sacrificed to a poor\r\nman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not altogether a sacrifice,\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is in love with\r\nher, and he\xe2\x80\x99s honest and upright. If she encourages him, what can you\r\nwish for more?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish for nothing definite. But there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of things possible for\r\nher. Why, Mrs. Charmond is wanting some refined young lady, I hear, to\r\ngo abroad with her\xe2\x80\x94as companion or something of the kind. She\xe2\x80\x99d jump at\r\nGrace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all uncertain. Better stick to what\xe2\x80\x99s sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue, true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Melbury; \xe2\x80\x9cand I hope it will be for the best. Yes,\r\nlet me get \xe2\x80\x99em married up as soon as I can, so as to have it over and\r\ndone with.\xe2\x80\x9d He continued looking at the imprint, while he added,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose she should be dying, and never make a track on this path any\r\nmore?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99ll write soon, depend upon\xe2\x80\x99t. Come, \xe2\x80\x99tis wrong to stay here and\r\nbrood so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe admitted it, but said he could not help it. \xe2\x80\x9cWhether she write or\r\nno, I shall fetch her in a few days.\xe2\x80\x9d And thus speaking, he covered the\r\ntrack, and preceded his wife indoors.\r\n\r\nMelbury, perhaps, was an unlucky man in having within him the sentiment\r\nwhich could indulge in this foolish fondness about the imprint of a\r\ndaughter\xe2\x80\x99s footstep. Nature does not carry on her government with a\r\nview to such feelings, and when advancing years render the open hearts\r\nof those who possess them less dexterous than formerly in shutting\r\nagainst the blast, they must suffer \xe2\x80\x9cbuffeting at will by rain and\r\nstorm\xe2\x80\x9d no less than Little Celandines.\r\n\r\nBut her own existence, and not Mr. Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s, was the centre of Marty\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconsciousness, and it was in relation to this that the matter struck\r\nher as she slowly withdrew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat, then, is the secret of it all,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd Giles Winterborne\r\nis not for me, and the less I think of him the better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe returned to her cottage. The sovereigns were staring at her from\r\nthe looking-glass as she had left them. With a preoccupied countenance,\r\nand with tears in her eyes, she got a pair of scissors, and began\r\nmercilessly cutting off the long locks of her hair, arranging and tying\r\nthem with their points all one way, as the barber had directed. Upon\r\nthe pale scrubbed deal of the coffin-stool table they stretched like\r\nwaving and ropy weeds over the washed gravel-bed of a clear stream.\r\n\r\nShe would not turn again to the little looking-glass, out of humanity\r\nto herself, knowing what a deflowered visage would look back at her,\r\nand almost break her heart; she dreaded it as much as did her own\r\nancestral goddess Sif the reflection in the pool after the rape of her\r\nlocks by Loke the malicious. She steadily stuck to business, wrapped\r\nthe hair in a parcel, and sealed it up, after which she raked out the\r\nfire and went to bed, having first set up an alarum made of a candle\r\nand piece of thread, with a stone attached.\r\n\r\nBut such a reminder was unnecessary to-night. Having tossed till about\r\nfive o\xe2\x80\x99clock, Marty heard the sparrows walking down their long holes in\r\nthe thatch above her sloping ceiling to their orifice at the eaves;\r\nwhereupon she also arose, and descended to the ground-floor again.\r\n\r\nIt was still dark, but she began moving about the house in those\r\nautomatic initiatory acts and touches which represent among housewives\r\nthe installation of another day. While thus engaged she heard the\r\nrumbling of Mr. Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s wagons, and knew that there, too, the day\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntoil had begun.\r\n\r\nAn armful of gads thrown on the still hot embers caused them to blaze\r\nup cheerfully and bring her diminished head-gear into sudden prominence\r\nas a shadow. At this a step approached the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre folk astir here yet?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired a voice she knew well.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Mr. Winterborne,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marty, throwing on a tilt bonnet, which\r\ncompletely hid the recent ravages of the scissors. \xe2\x80\x9cCome in!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe door was flung back, and there stepped in upon the mat a man not\r\nparticularly young for a lover, nor particularly mature for a person of\r\naffairs. There was reserve in his glance, and restraint upon his mouth.\r\nHe carried a horn lantern which hung upon a swivel, and wheeling as it\r\ndangled marked grotesque shapes upon the shadier part of the walls.\r\n\r\nHe said that he had looked in on his way down, to tell her that they\r\ndid not expect her father to make up his contract if he was not well.\r\nMr. Melbury would give him another week, and they would go their\r\njourney with a short load that day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are done,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marty, \xe2\x80\x9cand lying in the cart-house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDone!\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cYour father has not been too ill to work after\r\nall, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe made some evasive reply. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll show you where they be, if you are\r\ngoing down,\xe2\x80\x9d she added.\r\n\r\nThey went out and walked together, the pattern of the air-holes in the\r\ntop of the lantern being thrown upon the mist overhead, where they\r\nappeared of giant size, as if reaching the tent-shaped sky. They had no\r\nremarks to make to each other, and they uttered none. Hardly anything\r\ncould be more isolated or more self-contained than the lives of these\r\ntwo walking here in the lonely antelucan hour, when gray shades,\r\nmaterial and mental, are so very gray. And yet, looked at in a certain\r\nway, their lonely courses formed no detached design at all, but were\r\npart of the pattern in the great web of human doings then weaving in\r\nboth hemispheres, from the White Sea to Cape Horn.\r\n\r\nThe shed was reached, and she pointed out the spars. Winterborne\r\nregarded them silently, then looked at her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Marty, I believe\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat you\xe2\x80\x99ve done the work yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you tell anybody, will you, Mr. Winterborne?\xe2\x80\x9d she pleaded, by\r\nway of answer. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause I am afraid Mr. Melbury may refuse my work if\r\nhe knows it is mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how could you learn to do it? \xe2\x80\x99Tis a trade.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrade!\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d be bound to learn it in two hours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, Mrs. Marty.\xe2\x80\x9d Winterborne held down his lantern,\r\nand examined the cleanly split hazels as they lay. \xe2\x80\x9cMarty,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\nwith dry admiration, \xe2\x80\x9cyour father with his forty years of practice\r\nnever made a spar better than that. They are too good for the thatching\r\nof houses\xe2\x80\x94they are good enough for the furniture. But I won\xe2\x80\x99t tell. Let\r\nme look at your hands\xe2\x80\x94your poor hands!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had a kindly manner of a quietly severe tone; and when she seemed\r\nreluctant to show her hands, he took hold of one and examined it as if\r\nit were his own. Her fingers were blistered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ll get harder in time,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cFor if father continues ill, I\r\nshall have to go on wi\xe2\x80\x99 it. Now I\xe2\x80\x99ll help put \xe2\x80\x99em up in wagon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWinterborne without speaking set down his lantern, lifted her as she\r\nwas about to stoop over the bundles, placed her behind him, and began\r\nthrowing up the bundles himself. \xe2\x80\x9cRather than you should do it I will,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut the men will be here directly. Why, Marty!\xe2\x80\x94whatever has\r\nhappened to your head? Lord, it has shrunk to nothing\xe2\x80\x94it looks an apple\r\nupon a gate-post!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer heart swelled, and she could not speak. At length she managed to\r\ngroan, looking on the ground, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve made myself ugly\xe2\x80\x94and hateful\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhat I\xe2\x80\x99ve done!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve only cut your hair\xe2\x80\x94I see now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why must you needs say that about apples and gate-posts?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no!\xe2\x80\x9d She ran off into the gloom of the sluggish dawn. He did not\r\nattempt to follow her. When she reached her father\xe2\x80\x99s door she stood on\r\nthe step and looked back. Mr. Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s men had arrived, and were\r\nloading up the spars, and their lanterns appeared from the distance at\r\nwhich she stood to have wan circles round them, like eyes weary with\r\nwatching. She observed them for a few seconds as they set about\r\nharnessing the horses, and then went indoors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was now a distinct manifestation of morning in the air, and\r\npresently the bleared white visage of a sunless winter day emerged like\r\na dead-born child. The villagers everywhere had already bestirred\r\nthemselves, rising at this time of the year at the far less dreary hour\r\nof absolute darkness. It had been above an hour earlier, before a\r\nsingle bird had untucked his head, that twenty lights were struck in as\r\nmany bedrooms, twenty pairs of shutters opened, and twenty pairs of\r\neyes stretched to the sky to forecast the weather for the day.\r\n\r\nOwls that had been catching mice in the out-houses, rabbits that had\r\nbeen eating the wintergreens in the gardens, and stoats that had been\r\nsucking the blood of the rabbits, discerning that their human neighbors\r\nwere on the move, discreetly withdrew from publicity, and were seen and\r\nheard no more that day.\r\n\r\nThe daylight revealed the whole of Mr. Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s homestead, of which\r\nthe wagon-sheds had been an outlying erection. It formed three sides of\r\nan open quadrangle, and consisted of all sorts of buildings, the\r\nlargest and central one being the dwelling itself. The fourth side of\r\nthe quadrangle was the public road.\r\n\r\nIt was a dwelling-house of respectable, roomy, almost dignified aspect;\r\nwhich, taken with the fact that there were the remains of other such\r\nbuildings thereabout, indicated that Little Hintock had at some time or\r\nother been of greater importance than now, as its old name of Hintock\r\nSt. Osmond also testified. The house was of no marked antiquity, yet of\r\nwell-advanced age; older than a stale novelty, but no canonized\r\nantique; faded, not hoary; looking at you from the still distinct\r\nmiddle-distance of the early Georgian time, and awakening on that\r\naccount the instincts of reminiscence more decidedly than the remoter\r\nand far grander memorials which have to speak from the misty reaches of\r\nmediaevalism. The faces, dress, passions, gratitudes, and revenues of\r\nthe great-great-grandfathers and grandmothers who had been the first to\r\ngaze from those rectangular windows, and had stood under that\r\nkey-stoned doorway, could be divined and measured by homely standards\r\nof to-day. It was a house in whose reverberations queer old personal\r\ntales were yet audible if properly listened for; and not, as with those\r\nof the castle and cloister, silent beyond the possibility of echo.\r\n\r\nThe garden-front remained much as it had always been, and there was a\r\nporch and entrance that way. But the principal house-door opened on the\r\nsquare yard or quadrangle towards the road, formerly a regular carriage\r\nentrance, though the middle of the area was now made use of for\r\nstacking timber, fagots, bundles, and other products of the wood. It\r\nwas divided from the lane by a lichen-coated wall, in which hung a pair\r\nof gates, flanked by piers out of the perpendicular, with a round white\r\nball on the top of each.\r\n\r\nThe building on the left of the enclosure was a long-backed erection,\r\nnow used for spar-making, sawing, crib-framing, and copse-ware\r\nmanufacture in general. Opposite were the wagon-sheds where Marty had\r\ndeposited her spars.\r\n\r\nHere Winterborne had remained after the girl\xe2\x80\x99s abrupt departure, to see\r\nthat the wagon-loads were properly made up. Winterborne was connected\r\nwith the Melbury family in various ways. In addition to the sentimental\r\nrelationship which arose from his father having been the first Mrs.\r\nMelbury\xe2\x80\x99s lover, Winterborne\xe2\x80\x99s aunt had married and emigrated with the\r\nbrother of the timber-merchant many years before\xe2\x80\x94an alliance that was\r\nsufficient to place Winterborne, though the poorer, on a footing of\r\nsocial intimacy with the Melburys. As in most villages so secluded as\r\nthis, intermarriages were of Hapsburgian frequency among the\r\ninhabitants, and there were hardly two houses in Little Hintock\r\nunrelated by some matrimonial tie or other.\r\n\r\nFor this reason a curious kind of partnership existed between Melbury\r\nand the younger man\xe2\x80\x94a partnership based upon an unwritten code, by\r\nwhich each acted in the way he thought fair towards the other, on a\r\ngive-and-take principle. Melbury, with his timber and copse-ware\r\nbusiness, found that the weight of his labor came in winter and spring.\r\nWinterborne was in the apple and cider trade, and his requirements in\r\ncartage and other work came in the autumn of each year. Hence horses,\r\nwagons, and in some degree men, were handed over to him when the apples\r\nbegan to fall; he, in return, lending his assistance to Melbury in the\r\nbusiest wood-cutting season, as now.\r\n\r\nBefore he had left the shed a boy came from the house to ask him to\r\nremain till Mr. Melbury had seen him. Winterborne thereupon crossed\r\nover to the spar-house where two or three men were already at work, two\r\nof them being travelling spar-makers from White-hart Lane, who, when\r\nthis kind of work began, made their appearance regularly, and when it\r\nwas over disappeared in silence till the season came again.\r\n\r\nFirewood was the one thing abundant in Little Hintock; and a blaze of\r\ngad-cuds made the outhouse gay with its light, which vied with that of\r\nthe day as yet. In the hollow shades of the roof could be seen dangling\r\netiolated arms of ivy which had crept through the joints of the tiles\r\nand were groping in vain for some support, their leaves being dwarfed\r\nand sickly for want of sunlight; others were pushing in with such force\r\nat the eaves as to lift from their supports the shelves that were fixed\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nBesides the itinerant journey-workers there were also present John\r\nUpjohn, engaged in the hollow-turnery trade, who lived hard by; old\r\nTimothy Tangs and young Timothy Tangs, top and bottom sawyers, at work\r\nin Mr. Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s pit outside; Farmer Bawtree, who kept the cider-house,\r\nand Robert Creedle, an old man who worked for Winterborne, and stood\r\nwarming his hands; these latter being enticed in by the ruddy blaze,\r\nthough they had no particular business there. None of them call for any\r\nremark except, perhaps, Creedle. To have completely described him it\r\nwould have been necessary to write a military memoir, for he wore under\r\nhis smock-frock a cast-off soldier\xe2\x80\x99s jacket that had seen hot service,\r\nits collar showing just above the flap of the frock; also a hunting\r\nmemoir, to include the top-boots that he had picked up by chance; also\r\nchronicles of voyaging and shipwreck, for his pocket-knife had been\r\ngiven him by a weather-beaten sailor. But Creedle carried about with\r\nhim on his uneventful rounds these silent testimonies of war, sport,\r\nand adventure, and thought nothing of their associations or their\r\nstories.\r\n\r\nCopse-work, as it was called, being an occupation which the secondary\r\nintelligence of the hands and arms could carry on without requiring the\r\nsovereign attention of the head, the minds of its professors wandered\r\nconsiderably from the objects before them; hence the tales, chronicles,\r\nand ramifications of family history which were recounted here were of a\r\nvery exhaustive kind, and sometimes so interminable as to defy\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\nWinterborne, seeing that Melbury had not arrived, stepped back again\r\noutside the door; and the conversation interrupted by his momentary\r\npresence flowed anew, reaching his ears as an accompaniment to the\r\nregular dripping of the fog from the plantation boughs around.\r\n\r\nThe topic at present handled was a highly popular and frequent one\xe2\x80\x94the\r\npersonal character of Mrs. Charmond, the owner of the surrounding woods\r\nand groves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy brother-in-law told me, and I have no reason to doubt it,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nCreedle, \xe2\x80\x9cthat she\xe2\x80\x99d sit down to her dinner with a frock hardly higher\r\nthan her elbows. \xe2\x80\x98Oh, you wicked woman!\xe2\x80\x99 he said to himself when he\r\nfirst see her, \xe2\x80\x98you go to your church, and sit, and kneel, as if your\r\nknee-jints were greased with very saint\xe2\x80\x99s anointment, and tell off your\r\nHear-us-good-Lords like a business man counting money; and yet you can\r\neat your victuals such a figure as that!\xe2\x80\x99 Whether she\xe2\x80\x99s a reformed\r\ncharacter by this time I can\xe2\x80\x99t say; but I don\xe2\x80\x99t care who the man is,\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s how she went on when my brother-in-law lived there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid she do it in her husband\xe2\x80\x99s time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\xe2\x80\x94hardly, I should think, considering his temper. Ah!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHere Creedle threw grieved remembrance into physical form by slowly\r\nresigning his head to obliquity and letting his eyes water. \xe2\x80\x9cThat man!\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not if the angels of heaven come down, Creedle,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98shall you\r\ndo another day\xe2\x80\x99s work for me!\xe2\x80\x99 Yes\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99d say anything\xe2\x80\x94anything; and\r\nwould as soon take a winged creature\xe2\x80\x99s name in vain as yours or mine!\r\nWell, now I must get these spars home-along, and to-morrow, thank God,\r\nI must see about using \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAn old woman now entered upon the scene. She was Mr. Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s servant,\r\nand passed a great part of her time in crossing the yard between the\r\nhouse-door and the spar-shed, whither she had come now for fuel. She\r\nhad two facial aspects\xe2\x80\x94one, of a soft and flexible kind, she used\r\nindoors when assisting about the parlor or upstairs; the other, with\r\nstiff lines and corners, when she was bustling among the men in the\r\nspar-house or out-of-doors.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Grammer Oliver,\xe2\x80\x9d said John Upjohn, \xe2\x80\x9cit do do my heart good to see\r\na old woman like you so dapper and stirring, when I bear in mind that\r\nafter fifty one year counts as two did afore! But your smoke didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nrise this morning till twenty minutes past seven by my beater; and\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s late, Grammer Oliver.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you was a full-sized man, John, people might take notice of your\r\nscornful meanings. But your growing up was such a scrimped and scanty\r\nbusiness that really a woman couldn\xe2\x80\x99t feel hurt if you were to spit\r\nfire and brimstone itself at her. Here,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, holding out a\r\nspar-gad to one of the workmen, from which dangled a long\r\nblack-pudding\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9chere\xe2\x80\x99s something for thy breakfast, and if you want tea\r\nyou must fetch it from in-doors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Melbury is late this morning,\xe2\x80\x9d said the bottom-sawyer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. \xe2\x80\x99Twas a dark dawn,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Oliver. \xe2\x80\x9cEven when I opened the\r\ndoor, so late as I was, you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have told poor men from gentlemen,\r\nor John from a reasonable-sized object. And I don\xe2\x80\x99t think maister\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nslept at all well to-night. He\xe2\x80\x99s anxious about his daughter; and I know\r\nwhat that is, for I\xe2\x80\x99ve cried bucketfuls for my own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen the old woman had gone Creedle said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll fret his gizzard green if he don\xe2\x80\x99t soon hear from that maid of\r\nhis. Well, learning is better than houses and lands. But to keep a maid\r\nat school till she is taller out of pattens than her mother was in\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99tis tempting Providence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems no time ago that she was a little playward girl,\xe2\x80\x9d said young\r\nTimothy Tangs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can mind her mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said the hollow-turner. \xe2\x80\x9cAlways a teuny,\r\ndelicate piece; her touch upon your hand was as soft and cool as wind.\r\nShe was inoculated for the small-pox and had it beautifully fine, just\r\nabout the time that I was out of my apprenticeship\xe2\x80\x94ay, and a long\r\napprenticeship \xe2\x80\x99twas. I served that master of mine six years and three\r\nhundred and fourteen days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe hollow-turner pronounced the days with emphasis, as if, considering\r\ntheir number, they were a rather more remarkable fact than the years.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Winterborne\xe2\x80\x99s father walked with her at one time,\xe2\x80\x9d said old\r\nTimothy Tangs. \xe2\x80\x9cBut Mr. Melbury won her. She was a child of a woman,\r\nand would cry like rain if so be he huffed her. Whenever she and her\r\nhusband came to a puddle in their walks together he\xe2\x80\x99d take her up like\r\na half-penny doll and put her over without dirting her a speck. And if\r\nhe keeps the daughter so long at boarding-school, he\xe2\x80\x99ll make her as\r\nnesh as her mother was. But here he comes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJust before this moment Winterborne had seen Melbury crossing the court\r\nfrom his door. He was carrying an open letter in his hand, and came\r\nstraight to Winterborne. His gloom of the preceding night had quite\r\ngone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d no sooner made up my mind, Giles, to go and see why Grace didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncome or write than I get a letter from her\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Clifton: Wednesday. My dear\r\nfather,\xe2\x80\x99 says she, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m coming home to-morrow\xe2\x80\x99 (that\xe2\x80\x99s to-day), \xe2\x80\x98but I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t think it worth while to write long beforehand.\xe2\x80\x99 The little\r\nrascal, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t she! Now, Giles, as you are going to Sherton market\r\nto-day with your apple-trees, why not join me and Grace there, and\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ll drive home all together?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe made the proposal with cheerful energy; he was hardly the same man\r\nas the man of the small dark hours. Ever it happens that even among the\r\nmoodiest the tendency to be cheered is stronger than the tendency to be\r\ncast down; and a soul\xe2\x80\x99s specific gravity stands permanently less than\r\nthat of the sea of troubles into which it is thrown.\r\n\r\nWinterborne, though not demonstrative, replied to this suggestion with\r\nsomething like alacrity. There was not much doubt that Marty\xe2\x80\x99s grounds\r\nfor cutting off her hair were substantial enough, if Ambrose\xe2\x80\x99s eyes had\r\nbeen a reason for keeping it on. As for the timber-merchant, it was\r\nplain that his invitation had been given solely in pursuance of his\r\nscheme for uniting the pair. He had made up his mind to the course as a\r\nduty, and was strenuously bent upon following it out.\r\n\r\nAccompanied by Winterborne, he now turned towards the door of the\r\nspar-house, when his footsteps were heard by the men as aforesaid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, John, and Lot,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, nodding as he entered. \xe2\x80\x9cA rimy\r\nmorning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d said Creedle, energetically; for, not having as yet been\r\nable to summon force sufficient to go away and begin work, he felt the\r\nnecessity of throwing some into his speech. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care who the man\r\nis, \xe2\x80\x99tis the rimiest morning we\xe2\x80\x99ve had this fall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heard you wondering why I\xe2\x80\x99ve kept my daughter so long at\r\nboarding-school,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Mr. Melbury, looking up from the letter which\r\nhe was reading anew by the fire, and turning to them with the\r\nsuddenness that was a trait in him. \xe2\x80\x9cHey?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, with affected\r\nshrewdness. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you did, you know. Well, now, though it is my own\r\nbusiness more than anybody else\xe2\x80\x99s, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell ye. When I was a boy,\r\nanother boy\xe2\x80\x94the pa\xe2\x80\x99son\xe2\x80\x99s son\xe2\x80\x94along with a lot of others, asked me \xe2\x80\x98Who\r\ndragged Whom round the walls of What?\xe2\x80\x99 and I said, \xe2\x80\x98Sam Barrett, who\r\ndragged his wife in a chair round the tower corner when she went to be\r\nchurched.\xe2\x80\x99 They laughed at me with such torrents of scorn that I went\r\nhome ashamed, and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t sleep for shame; and I cried that night till\r\nmy pillow was wet: till at last I thought to myself there and\r\nthen\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98They may laugh at me for my ignorance, but that was father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfault, and none o\xe2\x80\x99 my making, and I must bear it. But they shall never\r\nlaugh at my children, if I have any: I\xe2\x80\x99ll starve first!\xe2\x80\x99 Thank God,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to keep her at school without sacrifice; and her\r\nscholarship is such that she stayed on as governess for a time. Let \xe2\x80\x99em\r\nlaugh now if they can: Mrs. Charmond herself is not better informed\r\nthan my girl Grace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was something between high indifference and humble emotion in his\r\ndelivery, which made it difficult for them to reply. Winterborne\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninterest was of a kind which did not show itself in words; listening,\r\nhe stood by the fire, mechanically stirring the embers with a spar-gad.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll be, then, ready, Giles?\xe2\x80\x9d Melbury continued, awaking from a\r\nreverie. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, what was the latest news at Shottsford yesterday, Mr.\r\nBawtree?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Shottsford is Shottsford still\xe2\x80\x94you can\xe2\x80\x99t victual your carcass\r\nthere unless you\xe2\x80\x99ve got money; and you can\xe2\x80\x99t buy a cup of genuine\r\nthere, whether or no....But as the saying is, \xe2\x80\x98Go abroad and you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nhear news of home.\xe2\x80\x99 It seems that our new neighbor, this young Dr.\r\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s-his-name, is a strange, deep, perusing gentleman; and there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngood reason for supposing he has sold his soul to the wicked one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Od name it all,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the timber-merchant, unimpressed by the\r\nnews, but reminded of other things by the subject of it; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got to\r\nmeet a gentleman this very morning? and yet I\xe2\x80\x99ve planned to go to\r\nSherton Abbas for the maid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t praise the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s wisdom till I hear what sort of bargain\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s made,\xe2\x80\x9d said the top-sawyer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis only an old woman\xe2\x80\x99s tale,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bawtree. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it seems that he\r\nwanted certain books on some mysterious science or black-art, and in\r\norder that the people hereabout should not know anything about his dark\r\nreadings, he ordered \xe2\x80\x99em direct from London, and not from the Sherton\r\nbook-seller. The parcel was delivered by mistake at the pa\xe2\x80\x99son\xe2\x80\x99s, and\r\nhe wasn\xe2\x80\x99t at home; so his wife opened it, and went into hysterics when\r\nshe read \xe2\x80\x99em, thinking her husband had turned heathen, and \xe2\x80\x99twould be\r\nthe ruin of the children. But when he came he said he knew no more\r\nabout \xe2\x80\x99em than she; and found they were this Mr. Fitzpier\xe2\x80\x99s property.\r\nSo he wrote \xe2\x80\x98Beware!\xe2\x80\x99 outside, and sent \xe2\x80\x99em on by the sexton.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe must be a curious young man,\xe2\x80\x9d mused the hollow-turner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe must,\xe2\x80\x9d said Timothy Tangs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Melbury, authoritatively, \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s only a gentleman\r\nfond of science and philosophy and poetry, and, in fact, every kind of\r\nknowledge; and being lonely here, he passes his time in making such\r\nmatters his hobby.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said old Timothy, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99tis a strange thing about doctors that the\r\nworse they be the better they be. I mean that if you hear anything of\r\nthis sort about \xe2\x80\x99em, ten to one they can cure ye as nobody else can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bawtree, emphatically. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd for my part I shall take my\r\ncustom from old Jones and go to this one directly I\xe2\x80\x99ve anything the\r\nmatter with me. That last medicine old Jones gave me had no taste in it\r\nat all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Melbury, as became a well-informed man, did not listen to these\r\nrecitals, being moreover preoccupied with the business appointment\r\nwhich had come into his head. He walked up and down, looking on the\r\nfloor\xe2\x80\x94his usual custom when undecided. That stiffness about the arm,\r\nhip, and knee-joint which was apparent when he walked was the net\r\nproduct of the divers sprains and over-exertions that had been required\r\nof him in handling trees and timber when a young man, for he was of the\r\nsort called self-made, and had worked hard. He knew the origin of every\r\none of these cramps: that in his left shoulder had come of carrying a\r\npollard, unassisted, from Tutcombe Bottom home; that in one leg was\r\ncaused by the crash of an elm against it when they were felling; that\r\nin the other was from lifting a bole. On many a morrow after wearying\r\nhimself by these prodigious muscular efforts, he had risen from his bed\r\nfresh as usual; his lassitude had departed, apparently forever; and\r\nconfident in the recuperative power of his youth, he had repeated the\r\nstrains anew. But treacherous Time had been only hiding ill results\r\nwhen they could be guarded against, for greater accumulation when they\r\ncould not. In his declining years the store had been unfolded in the\r\nform of rheumatisms, pricks, and spasms, in every one of which Melbury\r\nrecognized some act which, had its consequence been contemporaneously\r\nmade known, he would wisely have abstained from repeating.\r\n\r\nOn a summons by Grammer Oliver to breakfast, he left the shed. Reaching\r\nthe kitchen, where the family breakfasted in winter to save\r\nhouse-labor, he sat down by the fire, and looked a long time at the\r\npair of dancing shadows cast by each fire-iron and dog-knob on the\r\nwhitewashed chimney-corner\xe2\x80\x94a yellow one from the window, and a blue one\r\nfrom the fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t quite know what to do to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to his wife at last.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve recollected that I promised to meet Mrs. Charmond\xe2\x80\x99s steward in\r\nRound Wood at twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and yet I want to go for Grace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not let Giles fetch her by himself? \xe2\x80\x99Twill bring \xe2\x80\x99em together all\r\nthe quicker.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could do that\xe2\x80\x94but I should like to go myself. I always have gone,\r\nwithout fail, every time hitherto. It has been a great pleasure to\r\ndrive into Sherton, and wait and see her arrive; and perhaps she\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\ndisappointed if I stay away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may be disappointed, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think she will, if you send\r\nGiles,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Melbury, dryly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll send him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMelbury was often persuaded by the quietude of his wife\xe2\x80\x99s words when\r\nstrenuous argument would have had no effect. This second Mrs. Melbury\r\nwas a placid woman, who had been nurse to his child Grace before her\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s death. After that melancholy event little Grace had clung to\r\nthe nurse with much affection; and ultimately Melbury, in dread lest\r\nthe only woman who cared for the girl should be induced to leave her,\r\npersuaded the mild Lucy to marry him. The arrangement\xe2\x80\x94for it was little\r\nmore\xe2\x80\x94had worked satisfactorily enough; Grace had thriven, and Melbury\r\nhad not repented.\r\n\r\nHe returned to the spar-house and found Giles near at hand, to whom he\r\nexplained the change of plan. \xe2\x80\x9cAs she won\xe2\x80\x99t arrive till five o\xe2\x80\x99clock,\r\nyou can get your business very well over in time to receive her,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMelbury. \xe2\x80\x9cThe green gig will do for her; you\xe2\x80\x99ll spin along quicker with\r\nthat, and won\xe2\x80\x99t be late upon the road. Her boxes can be called for by\r\none of the wagons.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWinterborne, knowing nothing of the timber-merchant\xe2\x80\x99s restitutory aims,\r\nquietly thought all this to be a kindly chance. Wishing even more than\r\nher father to despatch his apple-tree business in the market before\r\nGrace\xe2\x80\x99s arrival, he prepared to start at once.\r\n\r\nMelbury was careful that the turnout should be seemly. The gig-wheels,\r\nfor instance, were not always washed during winter-time before a\r\njourney, the muddy roads rendering that labor useless; but they were\r\nwashed to-day. The harness was blacked, and when the rather elderly\r\nwhite horse had been put in, and Winterborne was in his seat ready to\r\nstart, Mr. Melbury stepped out with a blacking-brush, and with his own\r\nhands touched over the yellow hoofs of the animal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, Giles,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as he blacked, \xe2\x80\x9ccoming from a fashionable\r\nschool, she might feel shocked at the homeliness of home; and \xe2\x80\x99tis\r\nthese little things that catch a dainty woman\xe2\x80\x99s eye if they are\r\nneglected. We, living here alone, don\xe2\x80\x99t notice how the whitey-brown\r\ncreeps out of the earth over us; but she, fresh from a city\xe2\x80\x94why, she\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nnotice everything!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat she will,\xe2\x80\x9d said Giles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd scorn us if we don\xe2\x80\x99t mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot scorn us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, no\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s only words. She\xe2\x80\x99s too good a girl to do that. But\r\nwhen we consider what she knows, and what she has seen since she last\r\nsaw us, \xe2\x80\x99tis as well to meet her views as nearly as possible. Why, \xe2\x80\x99tis\r\na year since she was in this old place, owing to her going abroad in\r\nthe summer, which I agreed to, thinking it best for her; and naturally\r\nwe shall look small, just at first\xe2\x80\x94I only say just at first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s tone evinced a certain exultation in the very sense of\r\nthat inferiority he affected to deplore; for this advanced and refined\r\nbeing, was she not his own all the time? Not so Giles; he felt\r\ndoubtful\xe2\x80\x94perhaps a trifle cynical\xe2\x80\x94for that strand was wound into him\r\nwith the rest. He looked at his clothes with misgiving, then with\r\nindifference.\r\n\r\nIt was his custom during the planting season to carry a specimen\r\napple-tree to market with him as an advertisement of what he dealt in.\r\nThis had been tied across the gig; and as it would be left behind in\r\nthe town, it would cause no inconvenience to Miss Grace Melbury coming\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nHe drove away, the twigs nodding with each step of the horse; and\r\nMelbury went in-doors. Before the gig had passed out of sight, Mr.\r\nMelbury reappeared and shouted after\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, Giles,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, breathlessly following with some wraps, \xe2\x80\x9cit may\r\nbe very chilly to-night, and she may want something extra about her.\r\nAnd, Giles,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, when the young man, having taken the articles,\r\nput the horse in motion once more, \xe2\x80\x9ctell her that I should have come\r\nmyself, but I had particular business with Mrs. Charmond\xe2\x80\x99s agent, which\r\nprevented me. Don\xe2\x80\x99t forget.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe watched Winterborne out of sight, saying, with a jerk\xe2\x80\x94a shape into\r\nwhich emotion with him often resolved itself\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThere, now, I hope the\r\ntwo will bring it to a point and have done with it! \xe2\x80\x99Tis a pity to let\r\nsuch a girl throw herself away upon him\xe2\x80\x94a thousand pities!...And yet\r\n\xe2\x80\x99tis my duty for his father\xe2\x80\x99s sake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\nWinterborne sped on his way to Sherton Abbas without elation and\r\nwithout discomposure. Had he regarded his inner self spectacularly, as\r\nlovers are now daily more wont to do, he might have felt pride in the\r\ndiscernment of a somewhat rare power in him\xe2\x80\x94that of keeping not only\r\njudgment but emotion suspended in difficult cases. But he noted it not.\r\nNeither did he observe what was also the fact, that though he cherished\r\na true and warm feeling towards Grace Melbury, he was not altogether\r\nher fool just now. It must be remembered that he had not seen her for a\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nArrived at the entrance to a long flat lane, which had taken the spirit\r\nout of many a pedestrian in times when, with the majority, to travel\r\nmeant to walk, he saw before him the trim figure of a young woman in\r\npattens, journeying with that steadfast concentration which means\r\npurpose and not pleasure. He was soon near enough to see that she was\r\nMarty South. Click, click, click went the pattens; and she did not turn\r\nher head.\r\n\r\nShe had, however, become aware before this that the driver of the\r\napproaching gig was Giles. She had shrunk from being overtaken by him\r\nthus; but as it was inevitable, she had braced herself up for his\r\ninspection by closing her lips so as to make her mouth quite\r\nunemotional, and by throwing an additional firmness into her tread.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you wear pattens, Marty? The turnpike is clean enough, although\r\nthe lanes are muddy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey save my boots.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut twelve miles in pattens\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99twill twist your feet off. Come, get up\r\nand ride with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe hesitated, removed her pattens, knocked the gravel out of them\r\nagainst the wheel, and mounted in front of the nodding specimen\r\napple-tree. She had so arranged her bonnet with a full border and\r\ntrimmings that her lack of long hair did not much injure her\r\nappearance; though Giles, of course, saw that it was gone, and may have\r\nguessed her motive in parting with it, such sales, though infrequent,\r\nbeing not unheard of in that locality.\r\n\r\nBut nature\xe2\x80\x99s adornment was still hard by\xe2\x80\x94in fact, within two feet of\r\nhim, though he did not know it. In Marty\xe2\x80\x99s basket was a brown paper\r\npacket, and in the packet the chestnut locks, which, by reason of the\r\nbarber\xe2\x80\x99s request for secrecy, she had not ventured to intrust to other\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nGiles asked, with some hesitation, how her father was getting on.\r\n\r\nHe was better, she said; he would be able to work in a day or two; he\r\nwould be quite well but for his craze about the tree falling on him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know why I don\xe2\x80\x99t ask for him so often as I might, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nWinterborne. \xe2\x80\x9cOr don\xe2\x80\x99t you know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause of the houses?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I am afraid it may seem that my anxiety is about those houses,\r\nwhich I should lose by his death, more than about him. Marty, I do feel\r\nanxious about the houses, since half my income depends upon them; but I\r\ndo likewise care for him; and it almost seems wrong that houses should\r\nbe leased for lives, so as to lead to such mixed feelings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter father\xe2\x80\x99s death they will be Mrs. Charmond\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ll be hers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are going to keep company with my hair,\xe2\x80\x9d she thought.\r\n\r\nThus talking, they reached the town. By no pressure would she ride up\r\nthe street with him. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the right of another woman,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\nwith playful malice, as she put on her pattens. \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder what you are\r\nthinking of! Thank you for the lift in that handsome gig. Good-by.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe blushed a little, shook his head at her, and drove on ahead into the\r\nstreets\xe2\x80\x94the churches, the abbey, and other buildings on this clear\r\nbright morning having the liny distinctness of architectural drawings,\r\nas if the original dream and vision of the conceiving master-mason,\r\nsome mediaeval Vilars or other unknown to fame, were for a few minutes\r\nflashed down through the centuries to an unappreciative age. Giles saw\r\ntheir eloquent look on this day of transparency, but could not construe\r\nit. He turned into the inn-yard.\r\n\r\nMarty, following the same track, marched promptly to the\r\nhair-dresser\xe2\x80\x99s, Mr. Percombe\xe2\x80\x99s. Percombe was the chief of his trade in\r\nSherton Abbas. He had the patronage of such county offshoots as had\r\nbeen obliged to seek the shelter of small houses in that ancient town,\r\nof the local clergy, and so on, for some of whom he had made wigs,\r\nwhile others among them had compensated for neglecting him in their\r\nlifetime by patronizing him when they were dead, and letting him shave\r\ntheir corpses. On the strength of all this he had taken down his pole,\r\nand called himself \xe2\x80\x9cPerruquier to the aristocracy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNevertheless, this sort of support did not quite fill his children\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmouths, and they had to be filled. So, behind his house there was a\r\nlittle yard, reached by a passage from the back street, and in that\r\nyard was a pole, and under the pole a shop of quite another description\r\nthan the ornamental one in the front street. Here on Saturday nights\r\nfrom seven till ten he took an almost innumerable succession of\r\ntwopences from the farm laborers who flocked thither in crowds from the\r\ncountry. And thus he lived.\r\n\r\nMarty, of course, went to the front shop, and handed her packet to him\r\nsilently. \xe2\x80\x9cThank you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the barber, quite joyfully. \xe2\x80\x9cI hardly\r\nexpected it after what you said last night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned aside, while a tear welled up and stood in each eye at this\r\nreminder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing of what I told you,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered, there being others in the\r\nshop. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I can trust you, I see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had now reached the end of this distressing business, and went\r\nlistlessly along the street to attend to other errands. These occupied\r\nher till four o\xe2\x80\x99clock, at which time she recrossed the market-place. It\r\nwas impossible to avoid rediscovering Winterborne every time she passed\r\nthat way, for standing, as he always did at this season of the year,\r\nwith his specimen apple-tree in the midst, the boughs rose above the\r\nheads of the crowd, and brought a delightful suggestion of orchards\r\namong the crowded buildings there. When her eye fell upon him for the\r\nlast time he was standing somewhat apart, holding the tree like an\r\nensign, and looking on the ground instead of pushing his produce as he\r\nought to have been doing. He was, in fact, not a very successful seller\r\neither of his trees or of his cider, his habit of speaking his mind,\r\nwhen he spoke at all, militating against this branch of his business.\r\n\r\nWhile she regarded him he suddenly lifted his eyes in a direction away\r\nfrom Marty, his face simultaneously kindling with recognition and\r\nsurprise. She followed his gaze, and saw walking across to him a\r\nflexible young creature in whom she perceived the features of her she\r\nhad known as Miss Grace Melbury, but now looking glorified and refined\r\nabove her former level. Winterborne, being fixed to the spot by his\r\napple-tree, could not advance to meet her; he held out his spare hand\r\nwith his hat in it, and with some embarrassment beheld her coming on\r\ntiptoe through the mud to the middle of the square where he stood.\r\n\r\nMiss Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s arrival so early was, as Marty could see, unexpected by\r\nGiles, which accounted for his not being ready to receive her. Indeed,\r\nher father had named five o\xe2\x80\x99clock as her probable time, for which\r\nreason that hour had been looming out all the day in his forward\r\nperspective, like an important edifice on a plain. Now here she was\r\ncome, he knew not how, and his arranged welcome stultified.\r\n\r\nHis face became gloomy at her necessity for stepping into the road, and\r\nmore still at the little look of embarrassment which appeared on hers\r\nat having to perform the meeting with him under an apple-tree ten feet\r\nhigh in the middle of the market-place. Having had occasion to take off\r\nthe new gloves she had bought to come home in, she held out to him a\r\nhand graduating from pink at the tips of the fingers to white at the\r\npalm; and the reception formed a scene, with the tree over their heads,\r\nwhich was not by any means an ordinary one in Sherton Abbas streets.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the greeting on her looks and lips was of a restrained\r\ntype, which perhaps was not unnatural. For true it was that Giles\r\nWinterborne, well-attired and well-mannered as he was for a yeoman,\r\nlooked rough beside her. It had sometimes dimly occurred to him, in his\r\nruminating silence at Little Hintock, that external phenomena\xe2\x80\x94such as\r\nthe lowness or height or color of a hat, the fold of a coat, the make\r\nof a boot, or the chance attitude or occupation of a limb at the\r\ninstant of view\xe2\x80\x94may have a great influence upon feminine opinion of a\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s worth\xe2\x80\x94so frequently founded on non-essentials; but a certain\r\ncausticity of mental tone towards himself and the world in general had\r\nprevented to-day, as always, any enthusiastic action on the strength of\r\nthat reflection; and her momentary instinct of reserve at first sight\r\nof him was the penalty he paid for his laxness.\r\n\r\nHe gave away the tree to a by-stander, as soon as he could find one who\r\nwould accept the cumbersome gift, and the twain moved on towards the\r\ninn at which he had put up. Marty made as if to step forward for the\r\npleasure of being recognized by Miss Melbury; but abruptly checking\r\nherself, she glided behind a carrier\xe2\x80\x99s van, saying, dryly, \xe2\x80\x9cNo; I baint\r\nwanted there,\xe2\x80\x9d and critically regarded Winterborne\xe2\x80\x99s companion.\r\n\r\nIt would have been very difficult to describe Grace Melbury with\r\nprecision, either now or at any time. Nay, from the highest point of\r\nview, to precisely describe a human being, the focus of a universe\xe2\x80\x94how\r\nimpossible! But, apart from transcendentalism, there never probably\r\nlived a person who was in herself more completely a _reductio ad\r\nabsurdum_ of attempts to appraise a woman, even externally, by items of\r\nface and figure. Speaking generally, it may be said that she was\r\nsometimes beautiful, at other times not beautiful, according to the\r\nstate of her health and spirits.\r\n\r\nIn simple corporeal presentment she was of a fair and clear complexion,\r\nrather pale than pink, slim in build and elastic in movement. Her look\r\nexpressed a tendency to wait for others\xe2\x80\x99 thoughts before uttering her\r\nown; possibly also to wait for others\xe2\x80\x99 deeds before her own doing. In\r\nher small, delicate mouth, which had perhaps hardly settled down to its\r\nmatured curves, there was a gentleness that might hinder sufficient\r\nself-assertion for her own good. She had well-formed eyebrows which,\r\nhad her portrait been painted, would probably have been done in Prout\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nor Vandyke brown.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing remarkable in her dress just now, beyond a natural\r\nfitness and a style that was recent for the streets of Sherton. But,\r\nindeed, had it been the reverse, and quite striking, it would have\r\nmeant just as little. For there can be hardly anything less connected\r\nwith a woman\xe2\x80\x99s personality than drapery which she has neither designed,\r\nmanufactured, cut, sewed, or even seen, except by a glance of approval\r\nwhen told that such and such a shape and color must be had because it\r\nhas been decided by others as imperative at that particular time.\r\n\r\nWhat people, therefore, saw of her in a cursory view was very little;\r\nin truth, mainly something that was not she. The woman herself was a\r\nshadowy, conjectural creature who had little to do with the outlines\r\npresented to Sherton eyes; a shape in the gloom, whose true description\r\ncould only be approximated by putting together a movement now and a\r\nglance then, in that patient and long-continued attentiveness which\r\nnothing but watchful loving-kindness ever troubles to give.\r\n\r\nThere was a little delay in their setting out from the town, and Marty\r\nSouth took advantage of it to hasten forward, with the view of escaping\r\nthem on the way, lest they should feel compelled to spoil their\r\n_t\xc3\xaate-\xc3\xa0-t\xc3\xaate_ by asking her to ride. She walked fast, and one-third of\r\nthe journey was done, and the evening rapidly darkening, before she\r\nperceived any sign of them behind her. Then, while ascending a hill,\r\nshe dimly saw their vehicle drawing near the lowest part of the\r\nincline, their heads slightly bent towards each other; drawn together,\r\nno doubt, by their souls, as the heads of a pair of horses well in hand\r\nare drawn in by the rein. She walked still faster.\r\n\r\nBut between these and herself there was a carriage, apparently a\r\nbrougham, coming in the same direction, with lighted lamps. When it\r\novertook her\xe2\x80\x94which was not soon, on account of her pace\xe2\x80\x94the scene was\r\nmuch darker, and the lights glared in her eyes sufficiently to hide the\r\ndetails of the equipage.\r\n\r\nIt occurred to Marty that she might take hold behind this carriage and\r\nso keep along with it, to save herself the mortification of being\r\novertaken and picked up for pity\xe2\x80\x99s sake by the coming pair.\r\nAccordingly, as the carriage drew abreast of her in climbing the long\r\nascent, she walked close to the wheels, the rays of the nearest lamp\r\npenetrating her very pores. She had only just dropped behind when the\r\ncarriage stopped, and to her surprise the coachman asked her, over his\r\nshoulder, if she would ride. What made the question more surprising was\r\nthat it came in obedience to an order from the interior of the vehicle.\r\n\r\nMarty gladly assented, for she was weary, very weary, after working all\r\nnight and keeping afoot all day. She mounted beside the coachman,\r\nwondering why this good-fortune had happened to her. He was rather a\r\ngreat man in aspect, and she did not like to inquire of him for some\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nAt last she said, \xe2\x80\x9cWho has been so kind as to ask me to ride?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Charmond,\xe2\x80\x9d replied her statuesque companion.\r\n\r\nMarty was stirred at the name, so closely connected with her last\r\nnight\xe2\x80\x99s experiences. \xe2\x80\x9cIs this her carriage?\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; she\xe2\x80\x99s inside.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarty reflected, and perceived that Mrs. Charmond must have recognized\r\nher plodding up the hill under the blaze of the lamp; recognized,\r\nprobably, her stubbly poll (since she had kept away her face), and\r\nthought that those stubbles were the result of her own desire.\r\n\r\nMarty South was not so very far wrong. Inside the carriage a pair of\r\nbright eyes looked from a ripely handsome face, and though behind those\r\nbright eyes was a mind of unfathomed mysteries, beneath them there beat\r\na heart capable of quick extempore warmth\xe2\x80\x94a heart which could, indeed,\r\nbe passionately and imprudently warm on certain occasions. At present,\r\nafter recognizing the girl, she had acted on a mere impulse, possibly\r\nfeeling gratified at the denuded appearance which signified the success\r\nof her agent in obtaining what she had required.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis wonderful that she should ask ye,\xe2\x80\x9d observed the magisterial\r\ncoachman, presently. \xe2\x80\x9cI have never known her do it before, for as a\r\nrule she takes no interest in the village folk at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarty said no more, but occasionally turned her head to see if she\r\ncould get a glimpse of the Olympian creature who as the coachman had\r\ntruly observed, hardly ever descended from her clouds into the Tempe of\r\nthe parishioners. But she could discern nothing of the lady. She also\r\nlooked for Miss Melbury and Winterborne. The nose of their horse\r\nsometimes came quite near the back of Mrs. Charmond\xe2\x80\x99s carriage. But\r\nthey never attempted to pass it till the latter conveyance turned\r\ntowards the park gate, when they sped by. Here the carriage drew up\r\nthat the gate might be opened, and in the momentary silence Marty heard\r\na gentle oral sound, soft as a breeze.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMis\xe2\x80\x99ess yawning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should she yawn?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, because she\xe2\x80\x99s been used to such wonderfully good life, and finds\r\nit dull here. She\xe2\x80\x99ll soon be off again on account of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo rich and so powerful, and yet to yawn!\xe2\x80\x9d the girl murmured. \xe2\x80\x9cThen\r\nthings don\xe2\x80\x99t fay with she any more than with we!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarty now alighted; the lamp again shone upon her, and as the carriage\r\nrolled on, a soft voice said to her from the interior, \xe2\x80\x9cGood-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-night, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marty. But she had not been able to see the\r\nwoman who began so greatly to interest her\xe2\x80\x94the second person of her own\r\nsex who had operated strongly on her mind that day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Winterborne and Grace Melbury had also undergone their\r\nlittle experiences of the same homeward journey.\r\n\r\nAs he drove off with her out of the town the glances of people fell\r\nupon them, the younger thinking that Mr. Winterborne was in a pleasant\r\nplace, and wondering in what relation he stood towards her. Winterborne\r\nhimself was unconscious of this. Occupied solely with the idea of\r\nhaving her in charge, he did not notice much with outward eye, neither\r\nobserving how she was dressed, nor the effect of the picture they\r\ntogether composed in the landscape.\r\n\r\nTheir conversation was in briefest phrase for some time, Grace being\r\nsomewhat disconcerted, through not having understood till they were\r\nabout to start that Giles was to be her sole conductor in place of her\r\nfather. When they were in the open country he spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t Brownley\xe2\x80\x99s farm-buildings look strange to you, now they have\r\nbeen moved bodily from the hollow where the old ones stood to the top\r\nof the hill?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe admitted that they did, though she should not have seen any\r\ndifference in them if he had not pointed it out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey had a good crop of bitter-sweets; they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t grind them all\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n(nodding towards an orchard where some heaps of apples had been left\r\nlying ever since the ingathering).\r\n\r\nShe said \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d but looking at another orchard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you are looking at John-apple-trees! You know bitter-sweets\xe2\x80\x94you\r\nused to well enough!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid I have forgotten, and it is getting too dark to\r\ndistinguish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWinterborne did not continue. It seemed as if the knowledge and\r\ninterest which had formerly moved Grace\xe2\x80\x99s mind had quite died away from\r\nher. He wondered whether the special attributes of his image in the\r\npast had evaporated like these other things.\r\n\r\nHowever that might be, the fact at present was merely this, that where\r\nhe was seeing John-apples and farm-buildings she was beholding a far\r\nremoter scene\xe2\x80\x94a scene no less innocent and simple, indeed, but much\r\ncontrasting\xe2\x80\x94a broad lawn in the fashionable suburb of a fast city, the\r\nevergreen leaves shining in the evening sun, amid which bounding girls,\r\ngracefully clad in artistic arrangements of blue, brown, red, black,\r\nand white, were playing at games, with laughter and chat, in all the\r\npride of life, the notes of piano and harp trembling in the air from\r\nthe open windows adjoining. Moreover, they were girls\xe2\x80\x94and this was a\r\nfact which Grace Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s delicate femininity could not lose sight\r\nof\xe2\x80\x94whose parents Giles would have addressed with a deferential Sir or\r\nMadam. Beside this visioned scene the homely farmsteads did not quite\r\nhold their own from her present twenty-year point of survey. For all\r\nhis woodland sequestration, Giles knew the primitive simplicity of the\r\nsubject he had started, and now sounded a deeper note.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Twas very odd what we said to each other years ago; I often think of\r\nit. I mean our saying that if we still liked each other when you were\r\ntwenty and I twenty-five, we\xe2\x80\x99d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was child\xe2\x80\x99s tattle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cH\xe2\x80\x99m!\xe2\x80\x9d said Giles, suddenly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean we were young,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, more considerately. That gruff manner\r\nof his in making inquiries reminded her that he was unaltered in much.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes....I beg your pardon, Miss Melbury; your father _sent_ me to meet\r\nyou to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it, and I am glad of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe seemed satisfied with her tone and went on: \xe2\x80\x9cAt that time you were\r\nsitting beside me at the back of your father\xe2\x80\x99s covered car, when we\r\nwere coming home from gypsying, all the party being squeezed in\r\ntogether as tight as sheep in an auction-pen. It got darker and darker,\r\nand I said\xe2\x80\x94I forget the exact words\xe2\x80\x94but I put my arm round your waist\r\nand there you let it stay till your father, sitting in front suddenly\r\nstopped telling his story to Farmer Bollen, to light his pipe. The\r\nflash shone into the car, and showed us all up distinctly; my arm flew\r\nfrom your waist like lightning; yet not so quickly but that some of \xe2\x80\x99em\r\nhad seen, and laughed at us. Yet your father, to our amazement, instead\r\nof being angry, was mild as milk, and seemed quite pleased. Have you\r\nforgot all that, or haven\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe owned that she remembered it very well, now that he mentioned the\r\ncircumstances. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, goodness! I must have been in short frocks,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome now, Miss Melbury, that won\xe2\x80\x99t do! Short frocks, indeed! You know\r\nbetter, as well as I.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrace thereupon declared that she would not argue with an old friend\r\nshe valued so highly as she valued him, saying the words with the easy\r\nelusiveness that will be polite at all costs. It might possibly be\r\ntrue, she added, that she was getting on in girlhood when that event\r\ntook place; but if it were so, then she was virtually no less than an\r\nold woman now, so far did the time seem removed from her present. \xe2\x80\x9cDo\r\nyou ever look at things philosophically instead of personally?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t say that I do,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Giles, his eyes lingering far ahead\r\nupon a dark spot, which proved to be a brougham.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you may, sometimes, with advantage,\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cLook at\r\nyourself as a pitcher drifting on the stream with other pitchers, and\r\nconsider what contrivances are most desirable for avoiding cracks in\r\ngeneral, and not only for saving your poor one. Shall I tell you all\r\nabout Bath or Cheltenham, or places on the Continent that I visited\r\nlast summer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith all my heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe then described places and persons in such terms as might have been\r\nused for that purpose by any woman to any man within the four seas, so\r\nentirely absent from that description was everything specially\r\nappertaining to her own existence. When she had done she said, gayly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow do you tell me in return what has happened in Hintock since I have\r\nbeen away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnything to keep the conversation away from her and me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Giles\r\nwithin him.\r\n\r\nIt was true cultivation had so far advanced in the soil of Miss\r\nMelbury\xe2\x80\x99s mind as to lead her to talk by rote of anything save of that\r\nshe knew well, and had the greatest interest in developing\xe2\x80\x94that is to\r\nsay, herself.\r\n\r\nHe had not proceeded far with his somewhat bald narration when they\r\ndrew near the carriage that had been preceding them for some time. Miss\r\nMelbury inquired if he knew whose carriage it was.\r\n\r\nWinterborne, although he had seen it, had not taken it into account. On\r\nexamination, he said it was Mrs. Charmond\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nGrace watched the vehicle and its easy roll, and seemed to feel more\r\nnearly akin to it than to the one she was in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPooh! We can polish off the mileage as well as they, come to that,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Winterborne, reading her mind; and rising to emulation at what it\r\nbespoke, he whipped on the horse. This it was which had brought the\r\nnose of Mr. Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s old gray close to the back of Mrs. Charmond\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmuch-eclipsing vehicle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s Marty South sitting up with the coachman,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, discerning\r\nher by her dress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, poor Marty! I must ask her to come to see me this very evening.\r\nHow does she happen to be riding there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. It is very singular.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus these people with converging destinies went along the road\r\ntogether, till Winterborne, leaving the track of the carriage, turned\r\ninto Little Hintock, where almost the first house was the\r\ntimber-merchant\xe2\x80\x99s. Pencils of dancing light streamed out of the windows\r\nsufficiently to show the white laurestinus flowers, and glance over the\r\npolished leaves of laurel. The interior of the rooms could be seen\r\ndistinctly, warmed up by the fire-flames, which in the parlor were\r\nreflected from the glass of the pictures and bookcase, and in the\r\nkitchen from the utensils and ware.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us look at the dear place for a moment before we call them,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nIn the kitchen dinner was preparing; for though Melbury dined at one\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock at other times, to-day the meal had been kept back for Grace. A\r\nrickety old spit was in motion, its end being fixed in the fire-dog,\r\nand the whole kept going by means of a cord conveyed over pulleys along\r\nthe ceiling to a large stone suspended in a corner of the room. Old\r\nGrammer Oliver came and wound it up with a rattle like that of a mill.\r\n\r\nIn the parlor a large shade of Mrs. Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s head fell on the wall and\r\nceiling; but before the girl had regarded this room many moments their\r\npresence was discovered, and her father and stepmother came out to\r\nwelcome her.\r\n\r\nThe character of the Melbury family was of that kind which evinces some\r\nshyness in showing strong emotion among each other: a trait frequent in\r\nrural households, and one which stands in curiously inverse relation to\r\nmost of the peculiarities distinguishing villagers from the people of\r\ntowns. Thus hiding their warmer feelings under commonplace talk all\r\nround, Grace\xe2\x80\x99s reception produced no extraordinary demonstrations. But\r\nthat more was felt than was enacted appeared from the fact that her\r\nfather, in taking her in-doors, quite forgot the presence of Giles\r\nwithout, as did also Grace herself. He said nothing, but took the gig\r\nround to the yard and called out from the spar-house the man who\r\nparticularly attended to these matters when there was no conversation\r\nto draw him off among the copse-workers inside. Winterborne then\r\nreturned to the door with the intention of entering the house.\r\n\r\nThe family had gone into the parlor, and were still absorbed in\r\nthemselves. The fire was, as before, the only light, and it irradiated\r\nGrace\xe2\x80\x99s face and hands so as to make them look wondrously smooth and\r\nfair beside those of the two elders; shining also through the loose\r\nhair about her temples as sunlight through a brake. Her father was\r\nsurveying her in a dazed conjecture, so much had she developed and\r\nprogressed in manner and stature since he last had set eyes on her.\r\n\r\nObserving these things, Winterborne remained dubious by the door,\r\nmechanically tracing with his fingers certain time-worn letters carved\r\nin the jambs\xe2\x80\x94initials of by-gone generations of householders who had\r\nlived and died there.\r\n\r\nNo, he declared to himself, he would not enter and join the family;\r\nthey had forgotten him, and it was enough for to-day that he had\r\nbrought her home. Still, he was a little surprised that her father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neagerness to send him for Grace should have resulted in such an\r\nanticlimax as this.\r\n\r\nHe walked softly away into the lane towards his own house, looking back\r\nwhen he reached the turning, from which he could get a last glimpse of\r\nthe timber-merchant\xe2\x80\x99s roof. He hazarded guesses as to what Grace was\r\nsaying just at that moment, and murmured, with some self-derision,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cnothing about me!\xe2\x80\x9d He looked also in the other direction, and saw\r\nagainst the sky the thatched hip and solitary chimney of Marty\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncottage, and thought of her too, struggling bravely along under that\r\nhumble shelter, among her spar-gads and pots and skimmers.\r\n\r\nAt the timber-merchant\xe2\x80\x99s, in the mean time, the conversation flowed;\r\nand, as Giles Winterborne had rightly enough deemed, on subjects in\r\nwhich he had no share. Among the excluding matters there was, for one,\r\nthe effect upon Mr. Melbury of the womanly mien and manners of his\r\ndaughter, which took him so much unawares that, though it did not make\r\nhim absolutely forget the existence of her conductor homeward, thrust\r\nGiles\xe2\x80\x99s image back into quite the obscurest cellarage of his brain.\r\nAnother was his interview with Mrs. Charmond\xe2\x80\x99s agent that morning, at\r\nwhich the lady herself had been present for a few minutes. Melbury had\r\npurchased some standing timber from her a long time before, and now\r\nthat the date had come for felling it he was left to pursue almost his\r\nown course. This was what the household were actually talking of during\r\nGiles\xe2\x80\x99s cogitation without; and Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s satisfaction with the clear\r\natmosphere that had arisen between himself and the deity of the groves\r\nwhich enclosed his residence was the cause of a counterbalancing\r\nmistiness on the side towards Winterborne.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo thoroughly does she trust me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Melbury, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I might fell,\r\ntop, or lop, on my own judgment, any stick o\xe2\x80\x99 timber whatever in her\r\nwood, and fix the price o\xe2\x80\x99t, and settle the matter. But, name it all! I\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do such a thing. However, it may be useful to have this good\r\nunderstanding with her....I wish she took more interest in the place,\r\nand stayed here all the year round.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid \xe2\x80\x99tis not her regard for you, but her dislike of Hintock,\r\nthat makes her so easy about the trees,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Melbury.\r\n\r\nWhen dinner was over, Grace took a candle and began to ramble\r\npleasurably through the rooms of her old home, from which she had\r\nlatterly become wellnigh an alien. Each nook and each object revived a\r\nmemory, and simultaneously modified it. The chambers seemed lower than\r\nthey had appeared on any previous occasion of her return, the surfaces\r\nof both walls and ceilings standing in such relations to the eye that\r\nit could not avoid taking microscopic note of their irregularities and\r\nold fashion. Her own bedroom wore at once a look more familiar than\r\nwhen she had left it, and yet a face estranged. The world of little\r\nthings therein gazed at her in helpless stationariness, as though they\r\nhad tried and been unable to make any progress without her presence.\r\nOver the place where her candle had been accustomed to stand, when she\r\nhad used to read in bed till the midnight hour, there was still the\r\nbrown spot of smoke. She did not know that her father had taken\r\nespecial care to keep it from being cleaned off.\r\n\r\nHaving concluded her perambulation of this now uselessly commodious\r\nedifice, Grace began to feel that she had come a long journey since the\r\nmorning; and when her father had been up himself, as well as his wife,\r\nto see that her room was comfortable and the fire burning, she prepared\r\nto retire for the night. No sooner, however, was she in bed than her\r\nmomentary sleepiness took itself off, and she wished she had stayed up\r\nlonger. She amused herself by listening to the old familiar noises that\r\nshe could hear to be still going on down-stairs, and by looking towards\r\nthe window as she lay. The blind had been drawn up, as she used to have\r\nit when a girl, and she could just discern the dim tree-tops against\r\nthe sky on the neighboring hill. Beneath this meeting-line of light and\r\nshade nothing was visible save one solitary point of light, which\r\nblinked as the tree-twigs waved to and fro before its beams. From its\r\nposition it seemed to radiate from the window of a house on the\r\nhill-side. The house had been empty when she was last at home, and she\r\nwondered who inhabited the place now.\r\n\r\nHer conjectures, however, were not intently carried on, and she was\r\nwatching the light quite idly, when it gradually changed color, and at\r\nlength shone blue as sapphire. Thus it remained several minutes, and\r\nthen it passed through violet to red.\r\n\r\nHer curiosity was so widely awakened by the phenomenon that she sat up\r\nin bed, and stared steadily at the shine. An appearance of this sort,\r\nsufficient to excite attention anywhere, was no less than a marvel in\r\nHintock, as Grace had known the hamlet. Almost every diurnal and\r\nnocturnal effect in that woodland place had hitherto been the direct\r\nresult of the regular terrestrial roll which produced the season\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchanges; but here was something dissociated from these normal\r\nsequences, and foreign to local habit and knowledge.\r\n\r\nIt was about this moment that Grace heard the household below preparing\r\nto retire, the most emphatic noise in the proceeding being that of her\r\nfather bolting the doors. Then the stairs creaked, and her father and\r\nmother passed her chamber. The last to come was Grammer Oliver.\r\n\r\nGrace slid out of bed, ran across the room, and lifting the latch,\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cI am not asleep, Grammer. Come in and talk to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore the old woman had entered, Grace was again under the bedclothes.\r\nGrammer set down her candlestick, and seated herself on the edge of\r\nMiss Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s coverlet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want you to tell me what light that is I see on the hill-side,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nGrace.\r\n\r\nMrs. Oliver looked across. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, that,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cis from the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s often doing things of that sort. Perhaps you don\xe2\x80\x99t know that we\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\na doctor living here now\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Fitzpiers by name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrace admitted that she had not heard of him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, miss, he\xe2\x80\x99s come here to get up a practice. I know him very\r\nwell, through going there to help \xe2\x80\x99em scrub sometimes, which your\r\nfather said I might do, if I wanted to, in my spare time. Being a\r\nbachelor-man, he\xe2\x80\x99ve only a lad in the house. Oh yes, I know him very\r\nwell. Sometimes he\xe2\x80\x99ll talk to me as if I were his own mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. \xe2\x80\x98Grammer,\xe2\x80\x99 he said one day, when I asked him why he came here\r\nwhere there\xe2\x80\x99s hardly anybody living, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you why I came here. I\r\ntook a map, and I marked on it where Dr. Jones\xe2\x80\x99s practice ends to the\r\nnorth of this district, and where Mr. Taylor\xe2\x80\x99s ends on the south, and\r\nlittle Jimmy Green\xe2\x80\x99s on the east, and somebody else\xe2\x80\x99s to the west. Then\r\nI took a pair of compasses, and found the exact middle of the country\r\nthat was left between these bounds, and that middle was Little Hintock;\r\nso here I am....\xe2\x80\x99 But, Lord, there: poor young man!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe said, \xe2\x80\x98Grammer Oliver, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been here three months, and although\r\nthere are a good many people in the Hintocks and the villages round,\r\nand a scattered practice is often a very good one, I don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to get\r\nmany patients. And there\xe2\x80\x99s no society at all; and I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty near\r\nmelancholy mad,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, with a great yawn. \xe2\x80\x98I should be quite if it\r\nwere not for my books, and my lab\xe2\x80\x94laboratory, and what not. Grammer, I\r\nwas made for higher things.\xe2\x80\x99 And then he\xe2\x80\x99d yawn and yawn again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas he really made for higher things, do you think? I mean, is he\r\nclever?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, no. How can he be clever? He may be able to jine up a broken man\r\nor woman after a fashion, and put his finger upon an ache if you tell\r\nhim nearly where \xe2\x80\x99tis; but these young men\xe2\x80\x94they should live to my time\r\nof life, and then they\xe2\x80\x99d see how clever they were at five-and-twenty!\r\nAnd yet he\xe2\x80\x99s a projick, a real projick, and says the oddest of rozums.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, Grammer,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, at another time, \xe2\x80\x98let me tell you that\r\nEverything is Nothing. There\xe2\x80\x99s only Me and not Me in the whole world.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nAnd he told me that no man\xe2\x80\x99s hands could help what they did, any more\r\nthan the hands of a clock....Yes, he\xe2\x80\x99s a man of strange meditations,\r\nand his eyes seem to see as far as the north star.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe will soon go away, no doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think so.\xe2\x80\x9d Grace did not say \xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d and Grammer hesitated. At\r\nlast she went on: \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t tell your father or mother, miss, if I let you\r\nknow a secret.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrace gave the required promise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, he talks of buying me; so he won\xe2\x80\x99t go away just yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBuying you!\xe2\x80\x94how?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot my soul\xe2\x80\x94my body, when I\xe2\x80\x99m dead. One day when I was there cleaning,\r\nhe said, \xe2\x80\x98Grammer, you\xe2\x80\x99ve a large brain\xe2\x80\x94a very large organ of brain,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhe said. \xe2\x80\x98A woman\xe2\x80\x99s is usually four ounces less than a man\xe2\x80\x99s; but yours\r\nis man\xe2\x80\x99s size.\xe2\x80\x99 Well, then\xe2\x80\x94hee, hee!\xe2\x80\x94after he\xe2\x80\x99d flattered me a bit like\r\nthat, he said he\xe2\x80\x99d give me ten pounds to have me as a natomy after my\r\ndeath. Well, knowing I\xe2\x80\x99d no chick nor chiel left, and nobody with any\r\ninterest in me, I thought, faith, if I can be of any use to my\r\nfellow-creatures after I\xe2\x80\x99m gone they are welcome to my services; so I\r\nsaid I\xe2\x80\x99d think it over, and would most likely agree and take the ten\r\npounds. Now this is a secret, miss, between us two. The money would be\r\nvery useful to me; and I see no harm in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course there\xe2\x80\x99s no harm. But oh, Grammer, how can you think to do\r\nit? I wish you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t told me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94if you don\xe2\x80\x99t like to know it, miss. But you needn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmind. Lord\xe2\x80\x94hee, hee!\xe2\x80\x94I shall keep him waiting many a year yet, bless\r\nye!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope you will, I am sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl thereupon fell into such deep reflection that conversation\r\nlanguished, and Grammer Oliver, taking her candle, wished Miss Melbury\r\ngood-night. The latter\xe2\x80\x99s eyes rested on the distant glimmer, around\r\nwhich she allowed her reasoning fancy to play in vague eddies that\r\nshaped the doings of the philosopher behind that light on the lines of\r\nintelligence just received. It was strange to her to come back from the\r\nworld to Little Hintock and find in one of its nooks, like a tropical\r\nplant in a hedgerow, a nucleus of advanced ideas and practices which\r\nhad nothing in common with the life around. Chemical experiments,\r\nanatomical projects, and metaphysical conceptions had found a strange\r\nhome here.\r\n\r\nThus she remained thinking, the imagined pursuits of the man behind the\r\nlight intermingling with conjectural sketches of his personality, till\r\nher eyes fell together with their own heaviness, and she slept.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\nKaleidoscopic dreams of a weird alchemist-surgeon, Grammer Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nskeleton, and the face of Giles Winterborne, brought Grace Melbury to\r\nthe morning of the next day. It was fine. A north wind was blowing\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nnot unacceptable compromise between the atmospheric cutlery of the\r\neastern blast and the spongy gales of the west quarter. She looked from\r\nher window in the direction of the light of the previous evening, and\r\ncould just discern through the trees the shape of the surgeon\xe2\x80\x99s house.\r\nSomehow, in the broad, practical daylight, that unknown and lonely\r\ngentleman seemed to be shorn of much of the interest which had invested\r\nhis personality and pursuits in the hours of darkness, and as Grace\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndressing proceeded he faded from her mind.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Winterborne, though half assured of her father\xe2\x80\x99s favor, was\r\nrendered a little restless by Miss Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s behavior. Despite his dry\r\nself-control, he could not help looking continually from his own door\r\ntowards the timber-merchant\xe2\x80\x99s, in the probability of somebody\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nemergence therefrom. His attention was at length justified by the\r\nappearance of two figures, that of Mr. Melbury himself, and Grace\r\nbeside him. They stepped out in a direction towards the densest quarter\r\nof the wood, and Winterborne walked contemplatively behind them, till\r\nall three were soon under the trees.\r\n\r\nAlthough the time of bare boughs had now set in, there were sheltered\r\nhollows amid the Hintock plantations and copses in which a more tardy\r\nleave-taking than on windy summits was the rule with the foliage. This\r\ncaused here and there an apparent mixture of the seasons; so that in\r\nsome of the dells that they passed by holly-berries in full red were\r\nfound growing beside oak and hazel whose leaves were as yet not far\r\nremoved from green, and brambles whose verdure was rich and deep as in\r\nthe month of August. To Grace these well-known peculiarities were as an\r\nold painting restored.\r\n\r\nNow could be beheld that change from the handsome to the curious which\r\nthe features of a wood undergo at the ingress of the winter months.\r\nAngles were taking the place of curves, and reticulations of surfaces\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nchange constituting a sudden lapse from the ornate to the primitive on\r\nNature\xe2\x80\x99s canvas, and comparable to a retrogressive step from the art of\r\nan advanced school of painting to that of the Pacific Islander.\r\n\r\nWinterborne followed, and kept his eye upon the two figures as they\r\nthreaded their way through these sylvan phenomena. Mr. Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s long\r\nlegs, and gaiters drawn in to the bone at the ankles, his slight stoop,\r\nhis habit of getting lost in thought and arousing himself with an\r\nexclamation of \xe2\x80\x9cHah!\xe2\x80\x9d accompanied with an upward jerk of the head,\r\ncomposed a personage recognizable by his neighbors as far as he could\r\nbe seen. It seemed as if the squirrels and birds knew him. One of the\r\nformer would occasionally run from the path to hide behind the arm of\r\nsome tree, which the little animal carefully edged round _pari passu_\r\nwith Melbury and his daughters movement onward, assuming a mock manner,\r\nas though he were saying, \xe2\x80\x9cHo, ho; you are only a timber-merchant, and\r\ncarry no gun!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey went noiselessly over mats of starry moss, rustled through\r\ninterspersed tracts of leaves, skirted trunks with spreading roots,\r\nwhose mossed rinds made them like hands wearing green gloves; elbowed\r\nold elms and ashes with great forks, in which stood pools of water that\r\noverflowed on rainy days, and ran down their stems in green cascades.\r\nOn older trees still than these, huge lobes of fungi grew like lungs.\r\nHere, as everywhere, the Unfulfilled Intention, which makes life what\r\nit is, was as obvious as it could be among the depraved crowds of a\r\ncity slum. The leaf was deformed, the curve was crippled, the taper was\r\ninterrupted; the lichen eat the vigor of the stalk, and the ivy slowly\r\nstrangled to death the promising sapling.\r\n\r\nThey dived amid beeches under which nothing grew, the younger boughs\r\nstill retaining their hectic leaves, that rustled in the breeze with a\r\nsound almost metallic, like the sheet-iron foliage of the fabled\r\nJarnvid wood. Some flecks of white in Grace\xe2\x80\x99s drapery had enabled Giles\r\nto keep her and her father in view till this time; but now he lost\r\nsight of them, and was obliged to follow by ear\xe2\x80\x94no difficult matter,\r\nfor on the line of their course every wood-pigeon rose from its perch\r\nwith a continued clash, dashing its wings against the branches with\r\nwellnigh force enough to break every quill. By taking the track of this\r\nnoise he soon came to a stile.\r\n\r\nWas it worth while to go farther? He examined the doughy soil at the\r\nfoot of the stile, and saw among the large sole-and-heel tracks an\r\nimpression of a slighter kind from a boot that was obviously not local,\r\nfor Winterborne knew all the cobblers\xe2\x80\x99 patterns in that district,\r\nbecause they were very few to know. The mud-picture was enough to make\r\nhim swing himself over and proceed.\r\n\r\nThe character of the woodland now changed. The bases of the smaller\r\ntrees were nibbled bare by rabbits, and at divers points heaps of\r\nfresh-made chips, and the newly-cut stool of a tree, stared white\r\nthrough the undergrowth. There had been a large fall of timber this\r\nyear, which explained the meaning of some sounds that soon reached him.\r\n\r\nA voice was shouting intermittently in a sort of human bark, which\r\nreminded Giles that there was a sale of trees and fagots that very day.\r\nMelbury would naturally be present. Thereupon Winterborne remembered\r\nthat he himself wanted a few fagots, and entered upon the scene.\r\n\r\nA large group of buyers stood round the auctioneer, or followed him\r\nwhen, between his pauses, he wandered on from one lot of plantation\r\nproduce to another, like some philosopher of the Peripatetic school\r\ndelivering his lectures in the shady groves of the Lyceum. His\r\ncompanions were timber-dealers, yeomen, farmers, villagers, and others;\r\nmostly woodland men, who on that account could afford to be curious in\r\ntheir walking-sticks, which consequently exhibited various\r\nmonstrosities of vegetation, the chief being cork-screw shapes in black\r\nand white thorn, brought to that pattern by the slow torture of an\r\nencircling woodbine during their growth, as the Chinese have been said\r\nto mould human beings into grotesque toys by continued compression in\r\ninfancy. Two women, wearing men\xe2\x80\x99s jackets on their gowns, conducted in\r\nthe rear of the halting procession a pony-cart containing a tapped\r\nbarrel of beer, from which they drew and replenished horns that were\r\nhanded round, with bread-and-cheese from a basket.\r\n\r\nThe auctioneer adjusted himself to circumstances by using his\r\nwalking-stick as a hammer, and knocked down the lot on any convenient\r\nobject that took his fancy, such as the crown of a little boy\xe2\x80\x99s head,\r\nor the shoulders of a by-stander who had no business there except to\r\ntaste the brew; a proceeding which would have been deemed humorous but\r\nfor the air of stern rigidity which that auctioneer\xe2\x80\x99s face preserved,\r\ntending to show that the eccentricity was a result of that absence of\r\nmind which is engendered by the press of affairs, and no freak of fancy\r\nat all.\r\n\r\nMr. Melbury stood slightly apart from the rest of the Peripatetics, and\r\nGrace beside him, clinging closely to his arm, her modern attire\r\nlooking almost odd where everything else was old-fashioned, and\r\nthrowing over the familiar garniture of the trees a homeliness that\r\nseemed to demand improvement by the addition of a few contemporary\r\nnovelties also. Grace seemed to regard the selling with the interest\r\nwhich attaches to memories revived after an interval of obliviousness.\r\n\r\nWinterborne went and stood close to them; the timber-merchant spoke,\r\nand continued his buying; Grace merely smiled. To justify his presence\r\nthere Winterborne began bidding for timber and fagots that he did not\r\nwant, pursuing the occupation in an abstracted mood, in which the\r\nauctioneer\xe2\x80\x99s voice seemed to become one of the natural sounds of the\r\nwoodland. A few flakes of snow descended, at the sight of which a\r\nrobin, alarmed at these signs of imminent winter, and seeing that no\r\noffence was meant by the human invasion, came and perched on the tip of\r\nthe fagots that were being sold, and looked into the auctioneer\xe2\x80\x99s face,\r\nwhile waiting for some chance crumb from the bread-basket. Standing a\r\nlittle behind Grace, Winterborne observed how one flake would sail\r\ndownward and settle on a curl of her hair, and how another would choose\r\nher shoulder, and another the edge of her bonnet, which took up so much\r\nof his attention that his biddings proceeded incoherently; and when the\r\nauctioneer said, every now and then, with a nod towards him, \xe2\x80\x9cYours,\r\nMr. Winterborne,\xe2\x80\x9d he had no idea whether he had bought fagots, poles,\r\nor logwood.\r\n\r\nHe regretted, with some causticity of humor, that her father should\r\nshow such inequalities of temperament as to keep Grace tightly on his\r\narm to-day, when he had quite lately seemed anxious to recognize their\r\nbetrothal as a fact. And thus musing, and joining in no conversation\r\nwith other buyers except when directly addressed, he followed the\r\nassemblage hither and thither till the end of the auction, when Giles\r\nfor the first time realized what his purchases had been. Hundreds of\r\nfagots, and divers lots of timber, had been set down to him, when all\r\nhe had required had been a few bundles of spray for his odd man Robert\r\nCreedle\xe2\x80\x99s use in baking and lighting fires.\r\n\r\nBusiness being over, he turned to speak to the timber merchant. But\r\nMelbury\xe2\x80\x99s manner was short and distant; and Grace, too, looked vexed\r\nand reproachful. Winterborne then discovered that he had been\r\nunwittingly bidding against her father, and picking up his favorite\r\nlots in spite of him. With a very few words they left the spot and\r\npursued their way homeward.\r\n\r\nGiles was extremely sorry at what he had done, and remained standing\r\nunder the trees, all the other men having strayed silently away. He saw\r\nMelbury and his daughter pass down a glade without looking back. While\r\nthey moved slowly through it a lady appeared on horseback in the middle\r\ndistance, the line of her progress converging upon that of Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\nThey met, Melbury took off his hat, and she reined in her horse. A\r\nconversation was evidently in progress between Grace and her father and\r\nthis equestrian, in whom he was almost sure that he recognized Mrs.\r\nCharmond, less by her outline than by the livery of the groom who had\r\nhalted some yards off.\r\n\r\nThe interlocutors did not part till after a prolonged pause, during\r\nwhich much seemed to be said. When Melbury and Grace resumed their walk\r\nit was with something of a lighter tread than before.\r\n\r\nWinterborne then pursued his own course homeward. He was unwilling to\r\nlet coldness grow up between himself and the Melburys for any trivial\r\nreason, and in the evening he went to their house. On drawing near the\r\ngate his attention was attracted by the sight of one of the bedrooms\r\nblinking into a state of illumination. In it stood Grace lighting\r\nseveral candles, her right hand elevating the taper, her left hand on\r\nher bosom, her face thoughtfully fixed on each wick as it kindled, as\r\nif she saw in every flame\xe2\x80\x99s growth the rise of a life to maturity. He\r\nwondered what such unusual brilliancy could mean to-night. On getting\r\nin-doors he found her father and step-mother in a state of suppressed\r\nexcitement, which at first he could not comprehend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry about my biddings to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d said Giles. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I\r\nwas doing. I have come to say that any of the lots you may require are\r\nyours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, never mind\xe2\x80\x94never mind,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the timber-merchant, with a slight\r\nwave of his hand, \xe2\x80\x9cI have so much else to think of that I nearly had\r\nforgot it. Just now, too, there are matters of a different kind from\r\ntrade to attend to, so don\xe2\x80\x99t let it concern ye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs the timber-merchant spoke, as it were, down to him from a higher\r\nmoral plane than his own, Giles turned to Mrs. Melbury.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGrace is going to the House to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, quietly. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is\r\nlooking out her things now. I dare say she is wanting me this minute to\r\nassist her.\xe2\x80\x9d Thereupon Mrs. Melbury left the room.\r\n\r\nNothing is more remarkable than the independent personality of the\r\ntongue now and then. Mr. Melbury knew that his words had been a sort of\r\nboast. He decried boasting, particularly to Giles; yet whenever the\r\nsubject was Grace, his judgment resigned the ministry of speech in\r\nspite of him.\r\n\r\nWinterborne felt surprise, pleasure, and also a little apprehension at\r\nthe news. He repeated Mrs. Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said paternal pride, not sorry to have dragged out of him what\r\nhe could not in any circumstances have kept in. \xe2\x80\x9cComing home from the\r\nwoods this afternoon we met Mrs. Charmond out for a ride. She spoke to\r\nme on a little matter of business, and then got acquainted with Grace.\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Twas wonderful how she took to Grace in a few minutes; that\r\nfreemasonry of education made \xe2\x80\x99em close at once. Naturally enough she\r\nwas amazed that such an article\xe2\x80\x94ha, ha!\xe2\x80\x94could come out of my house. At\r\nlast it led on to Mis\xe2\x80\x99ess Grace being asked to the House. So she\xe2\x80\x99s busy\r\nhunting up her frills and furbelows to go in.\xe2\x80\x9d As Giles remained in\r\nthought without responding, Melbury continued: \xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99ll call her\r\ndown-stairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no; don\xe2\x80\x99t do that, since she\xe2\x80\x99s busy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Winterborne.\r\n\r\nMelbury, feeling from the young man\xe2\x80\x99s manner that his own talk had been\r\ntoo much at Giles and too little to him, repented at once. His face\r\nchanged, and he said, in lower tones, with an effort, \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s yours,\r\nGiles, as far as I am concerned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks\xe2\x80\x94my best thanks....But I think, since it is all right between us\r\nabout the biddings, that I\xe2\x80\x99ll not interrupt her now. I\xe2\x80\x99ll step\r\nhomeward, and call another time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn leaving the house he looked up at the bedroom again. Grace,\r\nsurrounded by a sufficient number of candles to answer all purposes of\r\nself-criticism, was standing before a cheval-glass that her father had\r\nlately bought expressly for her use; she was bonneted, cloaked, and\r\ngloved, and glanced over her shoulder into the mirror, estimating her\r\naspect. Her face was lit with the natural elation of a young girl\r\nhoping to inaugurate on the morrow an intimate acquaintance with a new,\r\ninteresting, and powerful friend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe inspiriting appointment which had led Grace Melbury to indulge in a\r\nsix-candle illumination for the arrangement of her attire, carried her\r\nover the ground the next morning with a springy tread. Her sense of\r\nbeing properly appreciated on her own native soil seemed to brighten\r\nthe atmosphere and herbage around her, as the glowworm\xe2\x80\x99s lamp\r\nirradiates the grass. Thus she moved along, a vessel of emotion going\r\nto empty itself on she knew not what.\r\n\r\nTwenty minutes\xe2\x80\x99 walking through copses, over a stile, and along an\r\nupland lawn brought her to the verge of a deep glen, at the bottom of\r\nwhich Hintock House appeared immediately beneath her eye. To describe\r\nit as standing in a hollow would not express the situation of the\r\nmanor-house; it stood in a hole, notwithstanding that the hole was full\r\nof beauty. From the spot which Grace had reached a stone could easily\r\nhave been thrown over or into, the birds\xe2\x80\x99-nested chimneys of the\r\nmansion. Its walls were surmounted by a battlemented parapet; but the\r\ngray lead roofs were quite visible behind it, with their gutters, laps,\r\nrolls, and skylights, together with incised letterings and\r\nshoe-patterns cut by idlers thereon.\r\n\r\nThe front of the house exhibited an ordinary manorial presentation of\r\nElizabethan windows, mullioned and hooded, worked in rich snuff-colored\r\nfreestone from local quarries. The ashlar of the walls, where not\r\novergrown with ivy and other creepers, was coated with lichen of every\r\nshade, intensifying its luxuriance with its nearness to the ground,\r\ntill, below the plinth, it merged in moss.\r\n\r\nAbove the house to the back was a dense plantation, the roots of whose\r\ntrees were above the level of the chimneys. The corresponding high\r\nground on which Grace stood was richly grassed, with only an old tree\r\nhere and there. A few sheep lay about, which, as they ruminated, looked\r\nquietly into the bedroom windows. The situation of the house,\r\nprejudicial to humanity, was a stimulus to vegetation, on which account\r\nan endless shearing of the heavy-armed ivy was necessary, and a\r\ncontinual lopping of trees and shrubs. It was an edifice built in times\r\nwhen human constitutions were damp-proof, when shelter from the\r\nboisterous was all that men thought of in choosing a dwelling-place,\r\nthe insidious being beneath their notice; and its hollow site was an\r\nocular reminder, by its unfitness for modern lives, of the fragility to\r\nwhich these have declined. The highest architectural cunning could have\r\ndone nothing to make Hintock House dry and salubrious; and ruthless\r\nignorance could have done little to make it unpicturesque. It was\r\nvegetable nature\xe2\x80\x99s own home; a spot to inspire the painter and poet of\r\nstill life\xe2\x80\x94if they did not suffer too much from the relaxing\r\natmosphere\xe2\x80\x94and to draw groans from the gregariously disposed. Grace\r\ndescended the green escarpment by a zigzag path into the drive, which\r\nswept round beneath the slope. The exterior of the house had been\r\nfamiliar to her from her childhood, but she had never been inside, and\r\nthe approach to knowing an old thing in a new way was a lively\r\nexperience. It was with a little flutter that she was shown in; but she\r\nrecollected that Mrs. Charmond would probably be alone. Up to a few\r\ndays before this time that lady had been accompanied in her comings,\r\nstayings, and goings by a relative believed to be her aunt; latterly,\r\nhowever, these two ladies had separated, owing, it was supposed, to a\r\nquarrel, and Mrs. Charmond had been left desolate. Being presumably a\r\nwoman who did not care for solitude, this deprivation might possibly\r\naccount for her sudden interest in Grace.\r\n\r\nMrs. Charmond was at the end of a gallery opening from the hall when\r\nMiss Melbury was announced, and saw her through the glass doors between\r\nthem. She came forward with a smile on her face, and told the young\r\ngirl it was good of her to come.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! you have noticed those,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, seeing that Grace\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were\r\nattracted by some curious objects against the walls. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are\r\nman-traps. My husband was a connoisseur in man-traps and spring-guns\r\nand such articles, collecting them from all his neighbors. He knew the\r\nhistories of all these\xe2\x80\x94which gin had broken a man\xe2\x80\x99s leg, which gun had\r\nkilled a man. That one, I remember his saying, had been set by a\r\ngame-keeper in the track of a notorious poacher; but the keeper,\r\nforgetting what he had done, went that way himself, received the charge\r\nin the lower part of his body, and died of the wound. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like them\r\nhere, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve never yet given directions for them to be taken away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nShe added, playfully, \xe2\x80\x9cMan-traps are of rather ominous significance\r\nwhere a person of our sex lives, are they not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrace was bound to smile; but that side of womanliness was one which\r\nher inexperience had no great zest in contemplating.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are interesting, no doubt, as relics of a barbarous time happily\r\npast,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, looking thoughtfully at the varied designs of these\r\ninstruments of torture\xe2\x80\x94some with semi-circular jaws, some with\r\nrectangular; most of them with long, sharp teeth, but a few with none,\r\nso that their jaws looked like the blank gums of old age.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we must not take them too seriously,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Charmond, with\r\nan indolent turn of her head, and they moved on inward. When she had\r\nshown her visitor different articles in cabinets that she deemed likely\r\nto interest her, some tapestries, wood-carvings, ivories, miniatures,\r\nand so on\xe2\x80\x94always with a mien of listlessness which might either have\r\nbeen constitutional, or partly owing to the situation of the place\xe2\x80\x94they\r\nsat down to an early cup of tea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you pour it out, please? Do,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, leaning back in her\r\nchair, and placing her hand above her forehead, while her almond\r\neyes\xe2\x80\x94those long eyes so common to the angelic legions of early Italian\r\nart\xe2\x80\x94became longer, and her voice more languishing. She showed that\r\noblique-mannered softness which is perhaps most frequent in women of\r\ndarker complexion and more lymphatic temperament than Mrs. Charmond\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwas; who lingeringly smile their meanings to men rather than speak\r\nthem, who inveigle rather than prompt, and take advantage of currents\r\nrather than steer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am the most inactive woman when I am here,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think\r\nsometimes I was born to live and do nothing, nothing, nothing but float\r\nabout, as we fancy we do sometimes in dreams. But that cannot be really\r\nmy destiny, and I must struggle against such fancies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am so sorry you do not enjoy exertion\xe2\x80\x94it is quite sad! I wish I\r\ncould tend you and make you very happy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was something so sympathetic, so appreciative, in the sound of\r\nGrace\xe2\x80\x99s voice, that it impelled people to play havoc with their\r\ncustomary reservations in talking to her. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is tender and kind of you\r\nto feel that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Charmond. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps I have given you the notion\r\nthat my languor is more than it really is. But this place oppresses me,\r\nand I have a plan of going abroad a good deal. I used to go with a\r\nrelative, but that arrangement has dropped through.\xe2\x80\x9d Regarding Grace\r\nwith a final glance of criticism, she seemed to make up her mind to\r\nconsider the young girl satisfactory, and continued: \xe2\x80\x9cNow I am often\r\nimpelled to record my impressions of times and places. I have often\r\nthought of writing a \xe2\x80\x98New _Sentimental Journey_.\xe2\x80\x99 But I cannot find\r\nenergy enough to do it alone. When I am at different places in the\r\nsouth of Europe I feel a crowd of ideas and fancies thronging upon me\r\ncontinually, but to unfold writing-materials, take up a cold steel pen,\r\nand put these impressions down systematically on cold, smooth\r\npaper\xe2\x80\x94that I cannot do. So I have thought that if I always could have\r\nsomebody at my elbow with whom I am in sympathy, I might dictate any\r\nideas that come into my head. And directly I had made your acquaintance\r\nthe other day it struck me that you would suit me so well. Would you\r\nlike to undertake it? You might read to me, too, if desirable. Will you\r\nthink it over, and ask your parents if they are willing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Grace. \xe2\x80\x9cI am almost sure they would be very glad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are so accomplished, I hear; I should be quite honored by such\r\nintellectual company.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrace, modestly blushing, deprecated any such idea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you keep up your lucubrations at Little Hintock?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no. Lucubrations are not unknown at Little Hintock; but they are\r\nnot carried on by me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x94another student in that retreat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a surgeon lately come, and I have heard that he reads a great\r\ndeal\xe2\x80\x94I see his light sometimes through the trees late at night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes\xe2\x80\x94a doctor\xe2\x80\x94I believe I was told of him. It is a strange place for\r\nhim to settle in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a convenient centre for a practice, they say. But he does not\r\nconfine his studies to medicine, it seems. He investigates theology and\r\nmetaphysics and all sorts of subjects.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is his name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFitzpiers. He represents a very old family, I believe, the Fitzpierses\r\nof Buckbury-Fitzpiers\xe2\x80\x94not a great many miles from here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not sufficiently local to know the history of the family. I was\r\nnever in the county till my husband brought me here.\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Charmond did\r\nnot care to pursue this line of investigation. Whatever mysterious\r\nmerit might attach to family antiquity, it was one which, though she\r\nherself could claim it, her adaptable, wandering _weltb\xc3\xbcrgerliche_\r\nnature had grown tired of caring about\xe2\x80\x94a peculiarity that made her a\r\ncontrast to her neighbors. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is of rather more importance to know\r\nwhat the man is himself than what his family is,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cif he is\r\ngoing to practise upon us as a surgeon. Have you seen him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrace had not. \xe2\x80\x9cI think he is not a very old man,\xe2\x80\x9d she added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas he a wife?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not aware that he has.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I hope he will be useful here. I must get to know him when I\r\ncome back. It will be very convenient to have a medical man\xe2\x80\x94if he is\r\nclever\xe2\x80\x94in one\xe2\x80\x99s own parish. I get dreadfully nervous sometimes, living\r\nin such an outlandish place; and Sherton is so far to send to. No doubt\r\nyou feel Hintock to be a great change after watering-place life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do. But it is home. It has its advantages and its disadvantages.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nGrace was thinking less of the solitude than of the attendant\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nThey chatted on for some time, Grace being set quite at her ease by her\r\nentertainer. Mrs. Charmond was far too well-practised a woman not to\r\nknow that to show a marked patronage to a sensitive young girl who\r\nwould probably be very quick to discern it, was to demolish her dignity\r\nrather than to establish it in that young girl\xe2\x80\x99s eyes. So, being\r\nviolently possessed with her idea of making use of this gentle\r\nacquaintance, ready and waiting at her own door, she took great pains\r\nto win her confidence at starting.\r\n\r\nJust before Grace\xe2\x80\x99s departure the two chanced to pause before a mirror\r\nwhich reflected their faces in immediate juxtaposition, so as to bring\r\ninto prominence their resemblances and their contrasts. Both looked\r\nattractive as glassed back by the faithful reflector; but Grace\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncountenance had the effect of making Mrs. Charmond appear more than her\r\nfull age. There are complexions which set off each other to great\r\nadvantage, and there are those which antagonize, the one killing or\r\ndamaging its neighbor unmercifully. This was unhappily the case here.\r\nMrs. Charmond fell into a meditation, and replied abstractedly to a\r\ncursory remark of her companion\xe2\x80\x99s. However, she parted from her young\r\nfriend in the kindliest tones, promising to send and let her know as\r\nsoon as her mind was made up on the arrangement she had suggested.\r\n\r\nWhen Grace had ascended nearly to the top of the adjoining slope she\r\nlooked back, and saw that Mrs. Charmond still stood at the door,\r\nmeditatively regarding her.\r\n\r\nOften during the previous night, after his call on the Melburys,\r\nWinterborne\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts ran upon Grace\xe2\x80\x99s announced visit to Hintock\r\nHouse. Why could he not have proposed to walk with her part of the way?\r\nSomething told him that she might not, on such an occasion, care for\r\nhis company.\r\n\r\nHe was still more of that opinion when, standing in his garden next\r\nday, he saw her go past on the journey with such a pretty pride in the\r\nevent. He wondered if her father\xe2\x80\x99s ambition, which had purchased for\r\nher the means of intellectual light and culture far beyond those of any\r\nother native of the village, would conduce to the flight of her future\r\ninterests above and away from the local life which was once to her the\r\nmovement of the world.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, he had her father\xe2\x80\x99s permission to win her if he could;\r\nand to this end it became desirable to bring matters soon to a crisis,\r\nif he ever hoped to do so. If she should think herself too good for\r\nhim, he could let her go and make the best of his loss; but until he\r\nhad really tested her he could not say that she despised his suit. The\r\nquestion was how to quicken events towards an issue.\r\n\r\nHe thought and thought, and at last decided that as good a way as any\r\nwould be to give a Christmas party, and ask Grace and her parents to\r\ncome as chief guests.\r\n\r\nThese ruminations were occupying him when there became audible a slight\r\nknocking at his front door. He descended the path and looked out, and\r\nbeheld Marty South, dressed for out-door work.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t you come, Mr. Winterborne?\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been waiting\r\nthere hours and hours, and at last I thought I must try to find you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBless my soul, I\xe2\x80\x99d quite forgot,\xe2\x80\x9d said Giles.\r\n\r\nWhat he had forgotten was that there was a thousand young fir-trees to\r\nbe planted in a neighboring spot which had been cleared by the\r\nwood-cutters, and that he had arranged to plant them with his own\r\nhands. He had a marvellous power of making trees grow. Although he\r\nwould seem to shovel in the earth quite carelessly, there was a sort of\r\nsympathy between himself and the fir, oak, or beech that he was\r\noperating on, so that the roots took hold of the soil in a few days.\r\nWhen, on the other hand, any of the journeymen planted, although they\r\nseemed to go through an identically similar process, one quarter of the\r\ntrees would die away during the ensuing August.\r\n\r\nHence Winterborne found delight in the work even when, as at present,\r\nhe contracted to do it on portions of the woodland in which he had no\r\npersonal interest. Marty, who turned her hand to anything, was usually\r\nthe one who performed the part of keeping the trees in a perpendicular\r\nposition while he threw in the mould.\r\n\r\nHe accompanied her towards the spot, being stimulated yet further to\r\nproceed with the work by the knowledge that the ground was close to the\r\nway-side along which Grace must pass on her return from Hintock House.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve a cold in the head, Marty,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as they walked. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\r\ncomes of cutting off your hair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose it do. Yes; I\xe2\x80\x99ve three headaches going on in my head at the\r\nsame time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree headaches!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, a rheumatic headache in my poll, a sick headache over my eyes,\r\nand a misery headache in the middle of my brain. However, I came out,\r\nfor I thought you might be waiting and grumbling like anything if I was\r\nnot there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe holes were already dug, and they set to work. Winterborne\xe2\x80\x99s fingers\r\nwere endowed with a gentle conjuror\xe2\x80\x99s touch in spreading the roots of\r\neach little tree, resulting in a sort of caress, under which the\r\ndelicate fibres all laid themselves out in their proper directions for\r\ngrowth. He put most of these roots towards the south-west; for, he\r\nsaid, in forty years\xe2\x80\x99 time, when some great gale is blowing from that\r\nquarter, the trees will require the strongest holdfast on that side to\r\nstand against it and not fall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow they sigh directly we put \xe2\x80\x99em upright, though while they are lying\r\ndown they don\xe2\x80\x99t sigh at all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo they?\xe2\x80\x9d said Giles. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never noticed it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe erected one of the young pines into its hole, and held up her\r\nfinger; the soft musical breathing instantly set in, which was not to\r\ncease night or day till the grown tree should be felled\xe2\x80\x94probably long\r\nafter the two planters should be felled themselves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to me,\xe2\x80\x9d the girl continued, \xe2\x80\x9cas if they sigh because they are\r\nvery sorry to begin life in earnest\xe2\x80\x94just as we be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust as we be?\xe2\x80\x9d He looked critically at her. \xe2\x80\x9cYou ought not to feel\r\nlike that, Marty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer only reply was turning to take up the next tree; and they planted\r\non through a great part of the day, almost without another word.\r\nWinterborne\xe2\x80\x99s mind ran on his contemplated evening-party, his\r\nabstraction being such that he hardly was conscious of Marty\xe2\x80\x99s presence\r\nbeside him. From the nature of their employment, in which he handled\r\nthe spade and she merely held the tree, it followed that he got good\r\nexercise and she got none. But she was an heroic girl, and though her\r\nout-stretched hand was chill as a stone, and her cheeks blue, and her\r\ncold worse than ever, she would not complain while he was disposed to\r\ncontinue work. But when he paused she said, \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Winterborne, can I run\r\ndown the lane and back to warm my feet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, yes, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, awakening anew to her existence.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThough I was just thinking what a mild day it is for the season. Now I\r\nwarrant that cold of yours is twice as bad as it was. You had no\r\nbusiness to chop that hair off, Marty; it serves you almost right. Look\r\nhere, cut off home at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA run down the lane will be quite enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it won\xe2\x80\x99t. You ought not to have come out to-day at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I should like to finish the\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarty, I tell you to go home,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, peremptorily. \xe2\x80\x9cI can manage to\r\nkeep the rest of them upright with a stick or something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe went away without saying any more. When she had gone down the\r\norchard a little distance she looked back. Giles suddenly went after\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarty, it was for your good that I was rough, you know. But warm\r\nyourself in your own way, I don\xe2\x80\x99t care.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen she had run off he fancied he discerned a woman\xe2\x80\x99s dress through\r\nthe holly-bushes which divided the coppice from the road. It was Grace\r\nat last, on her way back from the interview with Mrs. Charmond. He\r\nthrew down the tree he was planting, and was about to break through the\r\nbelt of holly when he suddenly became aware of the presence of another\r\nman, who was looking over the hedge on the opposite side of the way\r\nupon the figure of the unconscious Grace. He appeared as a handsome and\r\ngentlemanly personage of six or eight and twenty, and was quizzing her\r\nthrough an eye-glass. Seeing that Winterborne was noticing him, he let\r\nhis glass drop with a click upon the rail which protected the hedge,\r\nand walked away in the opposite direction. Giles knew in a moment that\r\nthis must be Mr. Fitzpiers. When he was gone, Winterborne pushed\r\nthrough the hollies, and emerged close beside the interesting object of\r\ntheir contemplation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heard the bushes move long before I saw you,\xe2\x80\x9d she began. \xe2\x80\x9cI said\r\nfirst, \xe2\x80\x98it is some terrible beast;\xe2\x80\x99 next, \xe2\x80\x98it is a poacher;\xe2\x80\x99 next, \xe2\x80\x98it\r\nis a friend!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe regarded her with a slight smile, weighing, not her speech, but the\r\nquestion whether he should tell her that she had been watched. He\r\ndecided in the negative.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have been to the house?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I need not ask.\xe2\x80\x9d The fact\r\nwas that there shone upon Miss Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s face a species of exaltation,\r\nwhich saw no environing details nor his own occupation; nothing more\r\nthan his bare presence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy need you not ask?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour face is like the face of Moses when he came down from the Mount.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe reddened a little and said, \xe2\x80\x9cHow can you be so profane, Giles\r\nWinterborne?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can you think so much of that class of people? Well, I beg pardon;\r\nI didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to speak so freely. How do you like her house and her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExceedingly. I had not been inside the walls since I was a child, when\r\nit used to be let to strangers, before Mrs. Charmond\xe2\x80\x99s late husband\r\nbought the property. She is SO nice!\xe2\x80\x9d And Grace fell into such an\r\nabstracted gaze at the imaginary image of Mrs. Charmond and her\r\nniceness that it almost conjured up a vision of that lady in mid-air\r\nbefore them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has only been here a month or two, it seems, and cannot stay much\r\nlonger, because she finds it so lonely and damp in winter. She is going\r\nabroad. Only think, she would like me to go with her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGiles\xe2\x80\x99s features stiffened a little at the news. \xe2\x80\x9cIndeed; what for? But\r\nI won\xe2\x80\x99t keep you standing here. Hoi, Robert!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried to a swaying\r\ncollection of clothes in the distance, which was the figure of Creedle\r\nhis man. \xe2\x80\x9cGo on filling in there till I come back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a-coming, sir; I\xe2\x80\x99m a-coming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, the reason is this,\xe2\x80\x9d continued she, as they went on\r\ntogether\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Charmond has a delightful side to her character\xe2\x80\x94a desire\r\nto record her impressions of travel, like Alexandre Dumas, and M\xc3\xa9ry,\r\nand Sterne, and others. But she cannot find energy enough to do it\r\nherself.\xe2\x80\x9d And Grace proceeded to explain Mrs. Charmond\xe2\x80\x99s proposal at\r\nlarge. \xe2\x80\x9cMy notion is that M\xc3\xa9ry\xe2\x80\x99s style will suit her best, because he\r\nwrites in that soft, emotional, luxurious way she has,\xe2\x80\x9d Grace said,\r\nmusingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed!\xe2\x80\x9d said Winterborne, with mock awe. \xe2\x80\x9cSuppose you talk over my\r\nhead a little longer, Miss Grace Melbury?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean it!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, repentantly, looking into his eyes.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd as for myself, I hate French books. And I love dear old Hintock,\r\n_and the people in it_, fifty times better than all the Continent. But\r\nthe scheme; I think it an enchanting notion, don\xe2\x80\x99t you, Giles?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is well enough in one sense, but it will take you away,\xe2\x80\x9d said he,\r\nmollified.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly for a short time. We should return in May.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Miss Melbury, it is a question for your father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWinterborne walked with her nearly to her house. He had awaited her\r\ncoming, mainly with the view of mentioning to her his proposal to have\r\na Christmas party; but homely Christmas gatherings in the venerable and\r\njovial Hintock style seemed so primitive and uncouth beside the lofty\r\nmatters of her converse and thought that he refrained.\r\n\r\nAs soon as she was gone he turned back towards the scene of his\r\nplanting, and could not help saying to himself as he walked, that this\r\nengagement of his was a very unpromising business. Her outing to-day\r\nhad not improved it. A woman who could go to Hintock House and be\r\nfriendly with its mistress, enter into the views of its mistress, talk\r\nlike her, and dress not much unlike her, why, she would hardly be\r\ncontented with him, a yeoman, now immersed in tree-planting, even\r\nthough he planted them well. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet she\xe2\x80\x99s a true-hearted girl,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, thinking of her words about Hintock. \xe2\x80\x9cI must bring matters to a\r\npoint, and there\xe2\x80\x99s an end of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen he reached the plantation he found that Marty had come back, and\r\ndismissing Creedle, he went on planting silently with the girl as\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose, Marty,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, after a while, looking at her extended arm,\r\nupon which old scratches from briers showed themselves purple in the\r\ncold wind\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9csuppose you know a person, and want to bring that person to\r\na good understanding with you, do you think a Christmas party of some\r\nsort is a warming-up thing, and likely to be useful in hastening on the\r\nmatter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there to be dancing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere might be, certainly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill He dance with She?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, yes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen it might bring things to a head, one way or the other; I won\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nthe one to say which.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt shall be done,\xe2\x80\x9d said Winterborne, not to her, though he spoke the\r\nwords quite loudly. And as the day was nearly ended, he added, \xe2\x80\x9cHere,\r\nMarty, I\xe2\x80\x99ll send up a man to plant the rest to-morrow. I\xe2\x80\x99ve other\r\nthings to think of just now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe did not inquire what other things, for she had seen him walking\r\nwith Grace Melbury. She looked towards the western sky, which was now\r\naglow like some vast foundery wherein new worlds were being cast.\r\nAcross it the bare bough of a tree stretched horizontally, revealing\r\nevery twig against the red, and showing in dark profile every beck and\r\nmovement of three pheasants that were settling themselves down on it in\r\na row to roost.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will be fine to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marty, observing them with the\r\nvermilion light of the sun in the pupils of her eyes, \xe2\x80\x9cfor they are\r\na-croupied down nearly at the end of the bough. If it were going to be\r\nstormy they\xe2\x80\x99d squeeze close to the trunk. The weather is almost all\r\nthey have to think of, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it, Mr. Winterborne? and so they must be\r\nlighter-hearted than we.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dare say they are,\xe2\x80\x9d said Winterborne.\r\n\r\nBefore taking a single step in the preparations, Winterborne, with no\r\ngreat hopes, went across that evening to the timber-merchant\xe2\x80\x99s to\r\nascertain if Grace and her parents would honor him with their presence.\r\nHaving first to set his nightly gins in the garden, to catch the\r\nrabbits that ate his winter-greens, his call was delayed till just\r\nafter the rising of the moon, whose rays reached the Hintock houses but\r\nfitfully as yet, on account of the trees. Melbury was crossing his yard\r\non his way to call on some one at the larger village, but he readily\r\nturned and walked up and down the path with the young man.\r\n\r\nGiles, in his self-deprecatory sense of living on a much smaller scale\r\nthan the Melburys did, would not for the world imply that his\r\ninvitation was to a gathering of any importance. So he put it in the\r\nmild form of \xe2\x80\x9cCan you come in for an hour, when you have done business,\r\nthe day after to-morrow; and Mrs. and Miss Melbury, if they have\r\nnothing more pressing to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMelbury would give no answer at once. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cI must talk it over with the women. As far as I am concerned, my\r\ndear Giles, you know I\xe2\x80\x99ll come with pleasure. But how do I know what\r\nGrace\xe2\x80\x99s notions may be? You see, she has been away among cultivated\r\nfolks a good while; and now this acquaintance with Mrs. Charmond\xe2\x80\x94Well,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll ask her. I can say no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Winterborne was gone the timber-merchant went on his way. He knew\r\nvery well that Grace, whatever her own feelings, would either go or not\r\ngo, according as he suggested; and his instinct was, for the moment, to\r\nsuggest the negative. His errand took him past the church, and the way\r\nto his destination was either across the church-yard or along-side it,\r\nthe distances being the same. For some reason or other he chose the\r\nformer way.\r\n\r\nThe moon was faintly lighting up the gravestones, and the path, and the\r\nfront of the building. Suddenly Mr. Melbury paused, turned ill upon the\r\ngrass, and approached a particular headstone, where he read, \xe2\x80\x9cIn memory\r\nof John Winterborne,\xe2\x80\x9d with the subjoined date and age. It was the grave\r\nof Giles\xe2\x80\x99s father.\r\n\r\nThe timber-merchant laid his hand upon the stone, and was humanized.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJack, my wronged friend!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be faithful to my plan of\r\nmaking amends to \xe2\x80\x99ee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen he reached home that evening, he said to Grace and Mrs. Melbury,\r\nwho were working at a little table by the fire,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGiles wants us to go down and spend an hour with him the day after\r\nto-morrow; and I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking, that as \xe2\x80\x99tis Giles who asks us, we\xe2\x80\x99ll go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey assented without demur, and accordingly the timber-merchant sent\r\nGiles the next morning an answer in the affirmative.\r\n\r\nWinterborne, in his modesty, or indifference, had mentioned no\r\nparticular hour in his invitation; and accordingly Mr. Melbury and his\r\nfamily, expecting no other guests, chose their own time, which chanced\r\nto be rather early in the afternoon, by reason of the somewhat quicker\r\ndespatch than usual of the timber-merchant\xe2\x80\x99s business that day. To show\r\ntheir sense of the unimportance of the occasion, they walked quite\r\nslowly to the house, as if they were merely out for a ramble, and going\r\nto nothing special at all; or at most intending to pay a casual call\r\nand take a cup of tea.\r\n\r\nAt this hour stir and bustle pervaded the interior of Winterborne\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndomicile from cellar to apple-loft. He had planned an elaborate high\r\ntea for six o\xe2\x80\x99clock or thereabouts, and a good roaring supper to come\r\non about eleven. Being a bachelor of rather retiring habits, the whole\r\nof the preparations devolved upon himself and his trusty man and\r\nfamiliar, Robert Creedle, who did everything that required doing, from\r\nmaking Giles\xe2\x80\x99s bed to catching moles in his field. He was a survival\r\nfrom the days when Giles\xe2\x80\x99s father held the homestead, and Giles was a\r\nplaying boy.\r\n\r\nThese two, with a certain dilatoriousness which appertained to both,\r\nwere now in the heat of preparation in the bake-house, expecting nobody\r\nbefore six o\xe2\x80\x99clock. Winterborne was standing before the brick oven in\r\nhis shirt-sleeves, tossing in thorn sprays, and stirring about the\r\nblazing mass with a long-handled, three-pronged Beelzebub kind of fork,\r\nthe heat shining out upon his streaming face and making his eyes like\r\nfurnaces, the thorns crackling and sputtering; while Creedle, having\r\nranged the pastry dishes in a row on the table till the oven should be\r\nready, was pressing out the crust of a final apple-pie with a\r\nrolling-pin. A great pot boiled on the fire, and through the open door\r\nof the back kitchen a boy was seen seated on the fender, emptying the\r\nsnuffers and scouring the candlesticks, a row of the latter standing\r\nupside down on the hob to melt out the grease.\r\n\r\nLooking up from the rolling-pin, Creedle saw passing the window first\r\nthe timber-merchant, in his second-best suit, Mrs. Melbury in her best\r\nsilk, and Grace in the fashionable attire which, in part brought home\r\nwith her from the Continent, she had worn on her visit to Mrs.\r\nCharmond\xe2\x80\x99s. The eyes of the three had been attracted to the proceedings\r\nwithin by the fierce illumination which the oven threw out upon the\r\noperators and their utensils.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord, Lord! if they baint come a\xe2\x80\x99ready!\xe2\x80\x9d said Creedle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94hey?\xe2\x80\x9d said Giles, looking round aghast; while the boy in the\r\nbackground waved a reeking candlestick in his delight. As there was no\r\nhelp for it, Winterborne went to meet them in the door-way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Giles, I see we have made a mistake in the time,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\ntimber-merchant\xe2\x80\x99s wife, her face lengthening with concern.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it is not much difference. I hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll come in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut this means a regular randyvoo!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Melbury, accusingly,\r\nglancing round and pointing towards the bake-house with his stick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Giles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd\xe2\x80\x94not Great Hintock band, and dancing, surely?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told three of \xe2\x80\x99em they might drop in if they\xe2\x80\x99d nothing else to do,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nGiles mildly admitted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, why the name didn\xe2\x80\x99t ye tell us \xe2\x80\x99twas going to be a serious kind\r\nof thing before? How should I know what folk mean if they don\xe2\x80\x99t say?\r\nNow, shall we come in, or shall we go home and come back along in a\r\ncouple of hours?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll stay, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll be so good as not to mind, now you are\r\nhere. I shall have it all right and tidy in a very little time. I ought\r\nnot to have been so backward.\xe2\x80\x9d Giles spoke quite anxiously for one of\r\nhis undemonstrative temperament; for he feared that if the Melburys\r\nonce were back in their own house they would not be disposed to turn\r\nout again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis we ought not to have been so forward; that\xe2\x80\x99s what \xe2\x80\x99tis,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr.\r\nMelbury, testily. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t keep us here in the sitting-room; lead on to\r\nthe bakehouse, man. Now we are here we\xe2\x80\x99ll help ye get ready for the\r\nrest. Here, mis\xe2\x80\x99ess, take off your things, and help him out in his\r\nbaking, or he won\xe2\x80\x99t get done to-night. I\xe2\x80\x99ll finish heating the oven,\r\nand set you free to go and skiver up them ducks.\xe2\x80\x9d His eye had passed\r\nwith pitiless directness of criticism into yet remote recesses of\r\nWinterborne\xe2\x80\x99s awkwardly built premises, where the aforesaid birds were\r\nhanging.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xe2\x80\x99ll help finish the tarts,\xe2\x80\x9d said Grace, cheerfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know about that,\xe2\x80\x9d said her father. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tisn\xe2\x80\x99t quite so much in\r\nyour line as it is in your mother-law\xe2\x80\x99s and mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t let you, Grace!\xe2\x80\x9d said Giles, with some distress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll do it, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Melbury, taking off her silk train,\r\nhanging it up to a nail, carefully rolling back her sleeves, pinning\r\nthem to her shoulders, and stripping Giles of his apron for her own\r\nuse.\r\n\r\nSo Grace pottered idly about, while her father and his wife helped on\r\nthe preparations. A kindly pity of his household management, which\r\nWinterborne saw in her eyes whenever he caught them, depressed him much\r\nmore than her contempt would have done.\r\n\r\nCreedle met Giles at the pump after a while, when each of the others\r\nwas absorbed in the difficulties of a _cuisine_ based on utensils,\r\ncupboards, and provisions that were strange to them. He groaned to the\r\nyoung man in a whisper, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is a bruckle het, maister, I\xe2\x80\x99m much\r\nafeared! Who\xe2\x80\x99d ha\xe2\x80\x99 thought they\xe2\x80\x99d ha\xe2\x80\x99 come so soon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe bitter placidity of Winterborne\xe2\x80\x99s look adumbrated the misgivings he\r\ndid not care to express. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you got the celery ready?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked,\r\nquickly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow that\xe2\x80\x99s a thing I never could mind; no, not if you\xe2\x80\x99d paid me in\r\nsilver and gold. And I don\xe2\x80\x99t care who the man is, I says that a stick\r\nof celery that isn\xe2\x80\x99t scrubbed with the scrubbing-brush is not clean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Very_ well, very well! I\xe2\x80\x99ll attend to it. You go and get \xe2\x80\x99em\r\ncomfortable in-doors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe hastened to the garden, and soon returned, tossing the stalks to\r\nCreedle, who was still in a tragic mood. \xe2\x80\x9cIf ye\xe2\x80\x99d ha\xe2\x80\x99 married, d\xe2\x80\x99ye\r\nsee, maister,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthis caddle couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have happened to us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEverything being at last under way, the oven set, and all done that\r\ncould insure the supper turning up ready at some time or other, Giles\r\nand his friends entered the parlor, where the Melburys again dropped\r\ninto position as guests, though the room was not nearly so warm and\r\ncheerful as the blazing bakehouse. Others now arrived, among them\r\nFarmer Bawtree and the hollow-turner, and tea went off very well.\r\n\r\nGrace\xe2\x80\x99s disposition to make the best of everything, and to wink at\r\ndeficiencies in Winterborne\xe2\x80\x99s menage, was so uniform and persistent\r\nthat he suspected her of seeing even more deficiencies than he was\r\naware of. That suppressed sympathy which had showed in her face ever\r\nsince her arrival told him as much too plainly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis muddling style of house-keeping is what you\xe2\x80\x99ve not lately been\r\nused to, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, when they were a little apart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; but I like it; it reminds me so pleasantly that everything here in\r\ndear old Hintock is just as it used to be. The oil is\xe2\x80\x94not quite nice;\r\nbut everything else is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe oil?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the chairs, I mean; because it gets on one\xe2\x80\x99s dress. Still, mine is\r\nnot a new one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGiles found that Creedle, in his zeal to make things look bright, had\r\nsmeared the chairs with some greasy kind of furniture-polish, and\r\nrefrained from rubbing it dry in order not to diminish the mirror-like\r\neffect that the mixture produced as laid on. Giles apologized and\r\ncalled Creedle; but he felt that the Fates were against him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n\r\nSupper-time came, and with it the hot-baked meats from the oven, laid\r\non a snowy cloth fresh from the press, and reticulated with folds, as\r\nin Flemish \xe2\x80\x9cLast Suppers.\xe2\x80\x9d Creedle and the boy fetched and carried with\r\namazing alacrity, the latter, to mollify his superior and make things\r\npleasant, expressing his admiration of Creedle\xe2\x80\x99s cleverness when they\r\nwere alone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI s\xe2\x80\x99pose the time when you learned all these knowing things, Mr.\r\nCreedle, was when you was in the militia?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, yes. I seed the world at that time somewhat, certainly, and many\r\nways of strange dashing life. Not but that Giles has worked hard in\r\nhelping me to bring things to such perfection to-day. \xe2\x80\x98Giles,\xe2\x80\x99 says I,\r\nthough he\xe2\x80\x99s maister. Not that I should call\xe2\x80\x99n maister by rights, for\r\nhis father growed up side by side with me, as if one mother had twinned\r\nus and been our nourishing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI s\xe2\x80\x99pose your memory can reach a long way back into history, Mr.\r\nCreedle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes. Ancient days, when there was battles and famines and\r\nhang-fairs and other pomps, seem to me as yesterday. Ah, many\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\npatriarch I\xe2\x80\x99ve seed come and go in this parish! There, he\xe2\x80\x99s calling for\r\nmore plates. Lord, why can\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x99em turn their plates bottom upward for\r\npudding, as they used to do in former days?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in the adjoining room Giles was presiding in a\r\nhalf-unconscious state. He could not get over the initial failures in\r\nhis scheme for advancing his suit, and hence he did not know that he\r\nwas eating mouthfuls of bread and nothing else, and continually\r\nsnuffing the two candles next him till he had reduced them to mere\r\nglimmers drowned in their own grease. Creedle now appeared with a\r\nspecially prepared dish, which he served by elevating the little\r\nthree-legged pot that contained it, and tilting the contents into a\r\ndish, exclaiming, simultaneously, \xe2\x80\x9cDraw back, gentlemen and ladies,\r\nplease!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA splash followed. Grace gave a quick, involuntary nod and blink, and\r\nput her handkerchief to her face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood heavens! what did you do that for, Creedle?\xe2\x80\x9d said Giles, sternly,\r\nand jumping up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis how I do it when they baint here, maister,\xe2\x80\x9d mildly expostulated\r\nCreedle, in an aside audible to all the company.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, yes\xe2\x80\x94but\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d replied Giles. He went over to Grace, and hoped none\r\nof it had gone into her eye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly a sprinkle on my face. It was nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKiss it and make it well,\xe2\x80\x9d gallantly observed Mr. Bawtree.\r\n\r\nMiss Melbury blushed.\r\n\r\nThe timber-merchant said, quickly, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, it is nothing! She must bear\r\nthese little mishaps.\xe2\x80\x9d But there could be discerned in his face\r\nsomething which said \xe2\x80\x9cI ought to have foreseen this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGiles himself, since the untoward beginning of the feast, had not quite\r\nliked to see Grace present. He wished he had not asked such people as\r\nBawtree and the hollow-turner. He had done it, in dearth of other\r\nfriends, that the room might not appear empty. In his mind\xe2\x80\x99s eye,\r\nbefore the event, they had been the mere background or padding of the\r\nscene, but somehow in reality they were the most prominent personages\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nAfter supper they played cards, Bawtree and the hollow-turner\r\nmonopolizing the new packs for an interminable game, in which a lump of\r\nchalk was incessantly used\xe2\x80\x94a game those two always played wherever they\r\nwere, taking a solitary candle and going to a private table in a corner\r\nwith the mien of persons bent on weighty matters. The rest of the\r\ncompany on this account were obliged to put up with old packs for their\r\nround game, that had been lying by in a drawer ever since the time that\r\nGiles\xe2\x80\x99s grandmother was alive. Each card had a great stain in the\r\nmiddle of its back, produced by the touch of generations of damp and\r\nexcited thumbs now fleshless in the grave; and the kings and queens\r\nwore a decayed expression of feature, as if they were rather an\r\nimpecunious dethroned race of monarchs hiding in obscure slums than\r\nreal regal characters. Every now and then the comparatively few remarks\r\nof the players at the round game were harshly intruded on by the\r\nmeasured jingle of Farmer Bawtree and the hollow-turner from the back\r\nof the room:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xe2\x80\xb2 will hold\xe2\x80\xb2 a wa\xe2\x80\xb2-ger with you\xe2\x80\xb2\r\nThat all\xe2\x80\xb2 these marks\xe2\x80\xb2 are thirt\xe2\x80\xb2-y two!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\naccompanied by rapping strokes with the chalk on the table; then an\r\nexclamation, an argument, a dealing of the cards; then the commencement\r\nof the rhymes anew.\r\n\r\nThe timber-merchant showed his feelings by talking with a satisfied\r\nsense of weight in his words, and by praising the party in a\r\npatronizing tone, when Winterborne expressed his fear that he and his\r\nwere not enjoying themselves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, yes; pretty much. What handsome glasses those are! I didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow you had such glasses in the house. Now, Lucy\xe2\x80\x9d (to his wife), \xe2\x80\x9cyou\r\nought to get some like them for ourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d And when they had abandoned\r\ncards, and Winterborne was talking to Melbury by the fire, it was the\r\ntimber-merchant who stood with his back to the mantle in a proprietary\r\nattitude, from which post of vantage he critically regarded Giles\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nperson, rather as a superficies than as a solid with ideas and feelings\r\ninside it, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a splendid coat that one is you have on,\r\nGiles! I can\xe2\x80\x99t get such coats. You dress better than I.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter supper there was a dance, the bandsmen from Great Hintock having\r\narrived some time before. Grace had been away from home so long that\r\nshe had forgotten the old figures, and hence did not join in the\r\nmovement. Then Giles felt that all was over. As for her, she was\r\nthinking, as she watched the gyrations, of a very different measure\r\nthat she had been accustomed to tread with a bevy of sylph-like\r\ncreatures in muslin, in the music-room of a large house, most of whom\r\nwere now moving in scenes widely removed from this, both as regarded\r\nplace and character.\r\n\r\nA woman she did not know came and offered to tell her fortune with the\r\nabandoned cards. Grace assented to the proposal, and the woman told her\r\ntale unskilfully, for want of practice, as she declared.\r\n\r\nMr. Melbury was standing by, and exclaimed, contemptuously, \xe2\x80\x9cTell her\r\nfortune, indeed! Her fortune has been told by men of science\xe2\x80\x94what do\r\nyou call \xe2\x80\x99em? Phrenologists. You can\xe2\x80\x99t teach her anything new. She\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbeen too far among the wise ones to be astonished at anything she can\r\nhear among us folks in Hintock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt last the time came for breaking up, Melbury and his family being the\r\nearliest to leave, the two card-players still pursuing their game\r\ndoggedly in the corner, where they had completely covered Giles\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmahogany table with chalk scratches. The three walked home, the\r\ndistance being short and the night clear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Giles is a very good fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Melbury, as they struck\r\ndown the lane under boughs which formed a black filigree in which the\r\nstars seemed set.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly he is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Grace, quickly, and in such a tone as to show\r\nthat he stood no lower, if no higher, in her regard than he had stood\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nWhen they were opposite an opening through which, by day, the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse could be seen, they observed a light in one of his rooms,\r\nalthough it was now about two o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe doctor is not abed yet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Melbury.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHard study, no doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d said her husband.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne would think that, as he seems to have nothing to do about here by\r\nday, he could at least afford to go to bed early at night. \xe2\x80\x99Tis\r\nastonishing how little we see of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMelbury\xe2\x80\x99s mind seemed to turn with much relief to the contemplation of\r\nMr. Fitzpiers after the scenes of the evening. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is natural enough,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe replied. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat can a man of that sort find to interest him in\r\nHintock? I don\xe2\x80\x99t expect he\xe2\x80\x99ll stay here long.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis mind reverted to Giles\xe2\x80\x99s party, and when they were nearly home he\r\nspoke again, his daughter being a few steps in advance: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is hardly\r\nthe line of life for a girl like Grace, after what she\xe2\x80\x99s been\r\naccustomed to. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t foresee that in sending her to boarding-school\r\nand letting her travel, and what not, to make her a good bargain for\r\nGiles, I should be really spoiling her for him. Ah, \xe2\x80\x99tis a thousand\r\npities! But he ought to have her\xe2\x80\x94he ought!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this moment the two exclusive, chalk-mark men, having at last really\r\nfinished their play, could be heard coming along in the rear,\r\nvociferously singing a song to march-time, and keeping vigorous step to\r\nthe same in far-reaching strides\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe may go, oh!\r\nShe may go, oh!\r\nShe may go to the d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 for me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe timber-merchant turned indignantly to Mrs. Melbury. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nsort of society we\xe2\x80\x99ve been asked to meet,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cFor us old folk it\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t matter; but for Grace\xe2\x80\x94Giles should have known better!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in the empty house from which the guests had just cleared\r\nout, the subject of their discourse was walking from room to room\r\nsurveying the general displacement of furniture with no ecstatic\r\nfeeling; rather the reverse, indeed. At last he entered the bakehouse,\r\nand found there Robert Creedle sitting over the embers, also lost in\r\ncontemplation. Winterborne sat down beside him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Robert, you must be tired. You\xe2\x80\x99d better get on to bed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay, Giles\xe2\x80\x94what do I call ye? Maister, I would say. But \xe2\x80\x99tis well\r\nto think the day _is_ done, when \xe2\x80\x99tis done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWinterborne had abstractedly taken the poker, and with a wrinkled\r\nforehead was ploughing abroad the wood-embers on the broad hearth, till\r\nit was like a vast scorching Sahara, with red-hot bowlders lying about\r\neverywhere. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think it went off well, Creedle?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe victuals did; that I know. And the drink did; that I steadfastly\r\nbelieve, from the holler sound of the barrels. Good, honest drink\r\n\xe2\x80\x99twere, the headiest mead I ever brewed; and the best wine that berries\r\ncould rise to; and the briskest Horner-and-Cleeves cider ever wrung\r\ndown, leaving out the spice and sperrits I put into it, while that\r\negg-flip would ha\xe2\x80\x99 passed through muslin, so little curdled \xe2\x80\x99twere.\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Twas good enough to make any king\xe2\x80\x99s heart merry\xe2\x80\x94ay, to make his whole\r\ncarcass smile. Still, I don\xe2\x80\x99t deny I\xe2\x80\x99m afeared some things didn\xe2\x80\x99t go\r\nwell with He and his.\xe2\x80\x9d Creedle nodded in a direction which signified\r\nwhere the Melburys lived.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid, too, that it was a failure there!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf so, \xe2\x80\x99twere doomed to be so. Not but what that snail might as well\r\nhave come upon anybody else\xe2\x80\x99s plate as hers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat snail?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, maister, there was a little one upon the edge of her plate when\r\nI brought it out; and so it must have been in her few leaves of\r\nwintergreen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow the deuce did a snail get there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I don\xe2\x80\x99t know no more than the dead; but there my gentleman was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Robert, of all places, that was where he shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, \xe2\x80\x99twas his native home, come to that; and where else could we\r\nexpect him to be? I don\xe2\x80\x99t care who the man is, snails and caterpillars\r\nalways will lurk in close to the stump of cabbages in that tantalizing\r\nway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe wasn\xe2\x80\x99t alive, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d said Giles, with a shudder on Grace\xe2\x80\x99s\r\naccount.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no. He was well boiled. I warrant him well boiled. God forbid that\r\na _live_ snail should be seed on any plate of victuals that\xe2\x80\x99s served by\r\nRobert Creedle....But Lord, there; I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind \xe2\x80\x99em myself\xe2\x80\x94them small\r\nones, for they were born on cabbage, and they\xe2\x80\x99ve lived on cabbage, so\r\nthey must be made of cabbage. But she, the close-mouthed little lady,\r\nshe didn\xe2\x80\x99t say a word about it; though \xe2\x80\x99twould have made good small\r\nconversation as to the nater of such creatures; especially as wit ran\r\nshort among us sometimes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99tis all over!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Giles to himself, shaking his head\r\nover the glooming plain of embers, and lining his forehead more than\r\never. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know, Robert,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat she\xe2\x80\x99s been accustomed to\r\nservants and everything superfine these many years? How, then, could\r\nshe stand our ways?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, all I can say is, then, that she ought to hob-and-nob elsewhere.\r\nThey shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have schooled her so monstrous high, or else bachelor\r\nmen shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t give randys, or if they do give \xe2\x80\x99em, only to their own\r\nrace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps that\xe2\x80\x99s true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Winterborne, rising and yawning a sigh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis a pity\xe2\x80\x94a thousand pities!\xe2\x80\x9d her father kept saying next morning at\r\nbreakfast, Grace being still in her bedroom.\r\n\r\nBut how could he, with any self-respect, obstruct Winterborne\xe2\x80\x99s suit at\r\nthis stage, and nullify a scheme he had labored to promote\xe2\x80\x94was, indeed,\r\nmechanically promoting at this moment? A crisis was approaching, mainly\r\nas a result of his contrivances, and it would have to be met.\r\n\r\nBut here was the fact, which could not be disguised: since seeing what\r\nan immense change her last twelve months of absence had produced in his\r\ndaughter, after the heavy sum per annum that he had been spending for\r\nseveral years upon her education, he was reluctant to let her marry\r\nGiles Winterborne, indefinitely occupied as woodsman, cider-merchant,\r\napple-farmer, and what not, even were she willing to marry him herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe will be his wife if you don\xe2\x80\x99t upset her notion that she\xe2\x80\x99s bound to\r\naccept him as an understood thing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Melbury. \xe2\x80\x9cBless ye,\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99ll soon shake down here in Hintock, and be content with Giles\xe2\x80\x99s way\r\nof living, which he\xe2\x80\x99ll improve with what money she\xe2\x80\x99ll have from you.\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Tis the strangeness after her genteel life that makes her feel\r\nuncomfortable at first. Why, when _I_ saw Hintock the first time I\r\nthought I never could like it. But things gradually get familiar, and\r\nstone floors seem not so very cold and hard, and the hooting of the\r\nowls not so very dreadful, and loneliness not so very lonely, after a\r\nwhile.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I believe ye. That\xe2\x80\x99s just it. I _know_ Grace will gradually sink\r\ndown to our level again, and catch our manners and way of speaking, and\r\nfeel a drowsy content in being Giles\xe2\x80\x99s wife. But I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear the\r\nthought of dragging down to that old level as promising a piece of\r\nmaidenhood as ever lived\xe2\x80\x94fit to ornament a palace wi\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94that I\xe2\x80\x99ve taken\r\nso much trouble to lift up. Fancy her white hands getting redder every\r\nday, and her tongue losing its pretty up-country curl in talking, and\r\nher bounding walk becoming the regular Hintock shail and wamble!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe may shail, but she\xe2\x80\x99ll never wamble,\xe2\x80\x9d replied his wife, decisively.\r\n\r\nWhen Grace came down-stairs he complained of her lying in bed so late;\r\nnot so much moved by a particular objection to that form of indulgence\r\nas discomposed by these other reflections.\r\n\r\nThe corners of her pretty mouth dropped a little down. \xe2\x80\x9cYou used to\r\ncomplain with justice when I was a girl,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I am a woman\r\nnow, and can judge for myself....But it is not that; it is something\r\nelse!\xe2\x80\x9d Instead of sitting down she went outside the door.\r\n\r\nHe was sorry. The petulance that relatives show towards each other is\r\nin truth directed against that intangible Causality which has shaped\r\nthe situation no less for the offenders than the offended, but is too\r\nelusive to be discerned and cornered by poor humanity in irritated\r\nmood. Melbury followed her. She had rambled on to the paddock, where\r\nthe white frost lay, and where starlings in flocks of twenties and\r\nthirties were walking about, watched by a comfortable family of\r\nsparrows perched in a line along the string-course of the chimney,\r\npreening themselves in the rays of the sun.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome in to breakfast, my girl,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd as to Giles, use your\r\nown mind. Whatever pleases you will please me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am promised to him, father; and I cannot help thinking that in honor\r\nI ought to marry him, whenever I do marry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had a strong suspicion that somewhere in the bottom of her heart\r\nthere pulsed an old simple indigenous feeling favorable to Giles,\r\nthough it had become overlaid with implanted tastes. But he would not\r\ndistinctly express his views on the promise. \xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\nI hope I sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t lose you yet. Come in to breakfast. What did you think\r\nof the inside of Hintock House the other day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI liked it much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDifferent from friend Winterborne\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe said nothing; but he who knew her was aware that she meant by her\r\nsilence to reproach him with drawing cruel comparisons.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Charmond has asked you to come again\xe2\x80\x94when, did you say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe thought Tuesday, but would send the day before to let me know if\r\nit suited her.\xe2\x80\x9d And with this subject upon their lips they entered to\r\nbreakfast.\r\n\r\nTuesday came, but no message from Mrs. Charmond. Nor was there any on\r\nWednesday. In brief, a fortnight slipped by without a sign, and it\r\nlooked suspiciously as if Mrs. Charmond were not going further in the\r\ndirection of \xe2\x80\x9ctaking up\xe2\x80\x9d Grace at present.\r\n\r\nHer father reasoned thereon. Immediately after his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s two\r\nindubitable successes with Mrs. Charmond\xe2\x80\x94the interview in the wood and\r\na visit to the House\xe2\x80\x94she had attended Winterborne\xe2\x80\x99s party. No doubt the\r\nout-and-out joviality of that gathering had made it a topic in the\r\nneighborhood, and that every one present as guests had been widely\r\nspoken of\xe2\x80\x94Grace, with her exceptional qualities, above all. What, then,\r\nso natural as that Mrs. Charmond should have heard the village news,\r\nand become quite disappointed in her expectations of Grace at finding\r\nshe kept such company?\r\n\r\nFull of this _post hoc_ argument, Mr. Melbury overlooked the infinite\r\nthrong of other possible reasons and unreasons for a woman changing her\r\nmind. For instance, while knowing that his Grace was attractive, he\r\nquite forgot that Mrs. Charmond had also great pretensions to beauty.\r\nIn his simple estimate, an attractive woman attracted all around.\r\n\r\nSo it was settled in his mind that her sudden mingling with the\r\nvillagers at the unlucky Winterborne\xe2\x80\x99s was the cause of her most\r\ngrievous loss, as he deemed it, in the direction of Hintock House.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis a thousand pities!\xe2\x80\x9d he would repeat to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cI am ruining her\r\nfor conscience\xe2\x80\x99 sake!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was one morning later on, while these things were agitating his\r\nmind, that, curiously enough, something darkened the window just as\r\nthey finished breakfast. Looking up, they saw Giles in person mounted\r\non horseback, and straining his neck forward, as he had been doing for\r\nsome time, to catch their attention through the window. Grace had been\r\nthe first to see him, and involuntarily exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cThere he is\xe2\x80\x94and a\r\nnew horse!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn their faces as they regarded Giles were written their suspended\r\nthoughts and compound feelings concerning him, could he have read them\r\nthrough those old panes. But he saw nothing: his features just now\r\nwere, for a wonder, lit up with a red smile at some other idea. So they\r\nrose from breakfast and went to the door, Grace with an anxious,\r\nwistful manner, her father in a reverie, Mrs. Melbury placid and\r\ninquiring. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have come out to look at your horse,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nIt could be seen that he was pleased at their attention, and explained\r\nthat he had ridden a mile or two to try the animal\xe2\x80\x99s paces. \xe2\x80\x9cI bought\r\nher,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, with warmth so severely repressed as to seem\r\nindifference, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause she has been used to carry a lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStill Mr. Melbury did not brighten. Mrs. Melbury said, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd is she\r\nquiet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWinterborne assured her that there was no doubt of it. \xe2\x80\x9cI took care of\r\nthat. She\xe2\x80\x99s five-and-twenty, and very clever for her age.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, get off and come in,\xe2\x80\x9d said Melbury, brusquely; and Giles\r\ndismounted accordingly.\r\n\r\nThis event was the concrete result of Winterborne\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts during the\r\npast week or two. The want of success with his evening party he had\r\naccepted in as philosophic a mood as he was capable of; but there had\r\nbeen enthusiasm enough left in him one day at Sherton Abbas market to\r\npurchase this old mare, which had belonged to a neighboring parson with\r\nseveral daughters, and was offered him to carry either a gentleman or a\r\nlady, and to do odd jobs of carting and agriculture at a pinch. This\r\nobliging quadruped seemed to furnish Giles with a means of reinstating\r\nhimself in Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s good opinion as a man of considerateness by\r\nthrowing out future possibilities to Grace.\r\n\r\nThe latter looked at him with intensified interest this morning, in the\r\nmood which is altogether peculiar to woman\xe2\x80\x99s nature, and which, when\r\nreduced into plain words, seems as impossible as the penetrability of\r\nmatter\xe2\x80\x94that of entertaining a tender pity for the object of her own\r\nunnecessary coldness. The imperturbable poise which marked Winterborne\r\nin general was enlivened now by a freshness and animation that set a\r\nbrightness in his eye and on his cheek. Mrs. Melbury asked him to have\r\nsome breakfast, and he pleasurably replied that he would join them,\r\nwith his usual lack of tactical observation, not perceiving that they\r\nhad all finished the meal, that the hour was inconveniently late, and\r\nthat the note piped by the kettle denoted it to be nearly empty; so\r\nthat fresh water had to be brought in, trouble taken to make it boil,\r\nand a general renovation of the table carried out. Neither did he know,\r\nso full was he of his tender ulterior object in buying that horse, how\r\nmany cups of tea he was gulping down one after another, nor how the\r\nmorning was slipping, nor how he was keeping the family from dispersing\r\nabout their duties.\r\n\r\nThen he told throughout the humorous story of the horse\xe2\x80\x99s purchase,\r\nlooking particularly grim at some fixed object in the room, a way he\r\nalways looked when he narrated anything that amused him. While he was\r\nstill thinking of the scene he had described, Grace rose and said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nhave to go and help my mother now, Mr. Winterborne.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cH\xe2\x80\x99m!\xe2\x80\x9d he ejaculated, turning his eyes suddenly upon her.\r\n\r\nShe repeated her words with a slight blush of awkwardness; whereupon\r\nGiles, becoming suddenly conscious, too conscious, jumped up, saying,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure, to be sure!\xe2\x80\x9d wished them quickly good-morning, and bolted\r\nout of the house.\r\n\r\nNevertheless he had, upon the whole, strengthened his position, with\r\nher at least. Time, too, was on his side, for (as her father saw with\r\nsome regret) already the homeliness of Hintock life was fast becoming\r\neffaced from her observation as a singularity; just as the first\r\nstrangeness of a face from which we have for years been separated\r\ninsensibly passes off with renewed intercourse, and tones itself down\r\ninto simple identity with the lineaments of the past.\r\n\r\nThus Mr. Melbury went out of the house still unreconciled to the\r\nsacrifice of the gem he had been at such pains in mounting. He fain\r\ncould hope, in the secret nether chamber of his mind, that something\r\nwould happen, before the balance of her feeling had quite turned in\r\nWinterborne\xe2\x80\x99s favor, to relieve his conscience and preserve her on her\r\nelevated plane.\r\n\r\nHe could not forget that Mrs. Charmond had apparently abandoned all\r\ninterest in his daughter as suddenly as she had conceived it, and was\r\nas firmly convinced as ever that the comradeship which Grace had shown\r\nwith Giles and his crew by attending his party had been the cause.\r\n\r\nMatters lingered on thus. And then, as a hoop by gentle knocks on this\r\nside and on that is made to travel in specific directions, the little\r\ntouches of circumstance in the life of this young girl shaped the\r\ncurves of her career.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a day of rather bright weather for the season. Miss Melbury went\r\nout for a morning walk, and her ever-regardful father, having an hour\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nleisure, offered to walk with her. The breeze was fresh and quite\r\nsteady, filtering itself through the denuded mass of twigs without\r\nswaying them, but making the point of each ivy-leaf on the trunks\r\nscratch its underlying neighbor restlessly. Grace\xe2\x80\x99s lips sucked in this\r\nnative air of hers like milk. They soon reached a place where the wood\r\nran down into a corner, and went outside it towards comparatively open\r\nground. Having looked round about, they were intending to re-enter the\r\ncopse when a fox quietly emerged with a dragging brush, trotted past\r\nthem tamely as a domestic cat, and disappeared amid some dead fern.\r\nThey walked on, her father merely observing, after watching the animal,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are hunting somewhere near.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFarther up they saw in the mid-distance the hounds running hither and\r\nthither, as if there were little or no scent that day. Soon divers\r\nmembers of the hunt appeared on the scene, and it was evident from\r\ntheir movements that the chase had been stultified by general\r\npuzzle-headedness as to the whereabouts of the intended victim. In a\r\nminute a farmer rode up to the two pedestrians, panting with acteonic\r\nexcitement, and Grace being a few steps in advance, he addressed her,\r\nasking if she had seen the fox.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cWe saw him some time ago\xe2\x80\x94just out there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you cry Halloo?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe said nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why the d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 didn\xe2\x80\x99t you, or get the old buffer to do it for you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the man, as he cantered away.\r\n\r\nShe looked rather disconcerted at this reply, and observing her\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s face, saw that it was quite red.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe ought not to have spoken to ye like that!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man, in the\r\ntone of one whose heart was bruised, though it was not by the epithet\r\napplied to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t if he had been a gentleman. \xe2\x80\x99Twas\r\nnot the language to use to a woman of any niceness. You, so well read\r\nand cultivated\xe2\x80\x94how could he expect ye to know what tom-boy field-folk\r\nare in the habit of doing? If so be you had just come from trimming\r\nswedes or mangolds\xe2\x80\x94joking with the rough work-folk and all that\xe2\x80\x94I could\r\nhave stood it. But hasn\xe2\x80\x99t it cost me near a hundred a year to lift you\r\nout of all that, so as to show an example to the neighborhood of what a\r\nwoman can be? Grace, shall I tell you the secret of it? \xe2\x80\x99Twas because I\r\nwas in your company. If a black-coated squire or pa\xe2\x80\x99son had been\r\nwalking with you instead of me he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have spoken so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, father; there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing in you rough or ill-mannered!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you it is that! I\xe2\x80\x99ve noticed, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve noticed it many times,\r\nthat a woman takes her color from the man she\xe2\x80\x99s walking with. The woman\r\nwho looks an unquestionable lady when she\xe2\x80\x99s with a polished-up fellow,\r\nlooks a mere tawdry imitation article when she\xe2\x80\x99s hobbing and nobbing\r\nwith a homely blade. You sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t be treated like that for long, or at\r\nleast your children sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t. You shall have somebody to walk with you\r\nwho looks more of a dandy than I\xe2\x80\x94please God you shall!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, my dear father,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, much distressed, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mind at all.\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t wish for more honor than I already have!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA perplexing and ticklish possession is a daughter,\xe2\x80\x9d according to\r\nMenander or some old Greek poet, and to nobody was one ever more so\r\nthan to Melbury, by reason of her very dearness to him. As for Grace,\r\nshe began to feel troubled; she did not perhaps wish there and then to\r\nunambitiously devote her life to Giles Winterborne, but she was\r\nconscious of more and more uneasiness at the possibility of being the\r\nsocial hope of the family.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou would like to have more honor, if it pleases me?\xe2\x80\x9d asked her\r\nfather, in continuation of the subject.\r\n\r\nDespite her feeling she assented to this. His reasoning had not been\r\nwithout its weight upon her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGrace,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, just before they had reached the house, \xe2\x80\x9cif it costs\r\nme my life you shall marry well! To-day has shown me that whatever a\r\nyoung woman\xe2\x80\x99s niceness, she stands for nothing alone. You shall marry\r\nwell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe breathed heavily, and his breathing was caught up by the breeze,\r\nwhich seemed to sigh a soft remonstrance.\r\n\r\nShe looked calmly at him. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd how about Mr. Winterborne?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mention it, father, not as a matter of sentiment, but as a question\r\nof keeping faith.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe timber-merchant\xe2\x80\x99s eyes fell for a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis a trying strait. Well, well; there\xe2\x80\x99s no hurry.\r\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ll wait and see how he gets on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat evening he called her into his room, a snug little apartment\r\nbehind the large parlor. It had at one time been part of the bakehouse,\r\nwith the ordinary oval brick oven in the wall; but Mr. Melbury, in\r\nturning it into an office, had built into the cavity an iron safe,\r\nwhich he used for holding his private papers. The door of the safe was\r\nnow open, and his keys were hanging from it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSit down, Grace, and keep me company,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou may amuse\r\nyourself by looking over these.\xe2\x80\x9d He threw out a heap of papers before\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are they?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSecurities of various sorts.\xe2\x80\x9d He unfolded them one by one. \xe2\x80\x9cPapers\r\nworth so much money each. Now here\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of turnpike bonds for one\r\nthing. Would you think that each of these pieces of paper is worth two\r\nhundred pounds?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, indeed, if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t say so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis so, then. Now here are papers of another sort. They are for\r\ndifferent sums in the three-per-cents. Now these are Port Breedy Harbor\r\nbonds. We have a great stake in that harbor, you know, because I send\r\noff timber there. Open the rest at your pleasure. They\xe2\x80\x99ll interest ye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I will, some day,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, rising.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense, open them now. You ought to learn a little of such matters.\r\nA young lady of education should not be ignorant of money affairs\r\naltogether. Suppose you should be left a widow some day, with your\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s title-deeds and investments thrown upon your hands\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t say that, father\xe2\x80\x94title-deeds; it sounds so vain!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt does not. Come to that, I have title-deeds myself. There, that\r\npiece of parchment represents houses in Sherton Abbas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d She hesitated, looked at the fire, and went on in a low\r\nvoice: \xe2\x80\x9cIf what has been arranged about me should come to anything, my\r\nsphere will be quite a middling one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour sphere ought not to be middling,\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, not in passion,\r\nbut in earnest conviction. \xe2\x80\x9cYou said you never felt more at home, more\r\nin your element, anywhere than you did that afternoon with Mrs.\r\nCharmond, when she showed you her house and all her knick-knacks, and\r\nmade you stay to tea so nicely in her drawing-room\xe2\x80\x94surely you did!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I did say so,\xe2\x80\x9d admitted Grace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas it true?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I felt so at the time. The feeling is less strong now, perhaps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! Now, though you don\xe2\x80\x99t see it, your feeling at the time was the\r\nright one, because your mind and body were just in full and fresh\r\ncultivation, so that going there with her was like meeting like. Since\r\nthen you\xe2\x80\x99ve been biding with us, and have fallen back a little, and so\r\nyou don\xe2\x80\x99t feel your place so strongly. Now, do as I tell ye, and look\r\nover these papers and see what you\xe2\x80\x99ll be worth some day. For they\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nall be yours, you know; who have I got to leave \xe2\x80\x99em to but you? Perhaps\r\nwhen your education is backed up by what these papers represent, and\r\nthat backed up by another such a set and their owner, men such as that\r\nfellow was this morning may think you a little more than a buffer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngirl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo she did as commanded, and opened each of the folded representatives\r\nof hard cash that her father put before her. To sow in her heart\r\ncravings for social position was obviously his strong desire, though in\r\ndirect antagonism to a better feeling which had hitherto prevailed with\r\nhim, and had, indeed, only succumbed that morning during the ramble.\r\n\r\nShe wished that she was not his worldly hope; the responsibility of\r\nsuch a position was too great. She had made it for herself mainly by\r\nher appearance and attractive behavior to him since her return. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I\r\nhad only come home in a shabby dress, and tried to speak roughly, this\r\nmight not have happened,\xe2\x80\x9d she thought. She deplored less the fact than\r\nthe sad possibilities that might lie hidden therein.\r\n\r\nHer father then insisted upon her looking over his checkbook and\r\nreading the counterfoils. This, also, she obediently did, and at last\r\ncame to two or three which had been drawn to defray some of the late\r\nexpenses of her clothes, board, and education.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI, too, cost a good deal, like the horses and wagons and corn,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid, looking up sorrily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t want you to look at those; I merely meant to give you an idea\r\nof my investment transactions. But if you do cost as much as they,\r\nnever mind. You\xe2\x80\x99ll yield a better return.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t think of me like that!\xe2\x80\x9d she begged. \xe2\x80\x9cA mere chattel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA what? Oh, a dictionary word. Well, as that\xe2\x80\x99s in your line I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nforbid it, even if it tells against me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, good-humoredly. And\r\nhe looked her proudly up and down.\r\n\r\nA few minutes later Grammer Oliver came to tell them that supper was\r\nready, and in giving the information she added, incidentally, \xe2\x80\x9cSo we\r\nshall soon lose the mistress of Hintock House for some time, I hear,\r\nMaister Melbury. Yes, she\xe2\x80\x99s going off to foreign parts to-morrow, for\r\nthe rest of the winter months; and be-chok\xe2\x80\x99d if I don\xe2\x80\x99t wish I could do\r\nthe same, for my wynd-pipe is furred like a flue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen the old woman had left the room, Melbury turned to his daughter\r\nand said, \xe2\x80\x9cSo, Grace, you\xe2\x80\x99ve lost your new friend, and your chance of\r\nkeeping her company and writing her travels is quite gone from ye!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrace said nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, emphatically, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99tis Winterborne\xe2\x80\x99s affair has done\r\nthis. Oh yes, \xe2\x80\x99tis. So let me say one word. Promise me that you will\r\nnot meet him again without my knowledge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never do meet him, father, either without your knowledge or with\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo much the better. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like the look of this at all. And I say it\r\nnot out of harshness to him, poor fellow, but out of tenderness to you.\r\nFor how could a woman, brought up delicately as you have been, bear the\r\nroughness of a life with him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe sighed; it was a sigh of sympathy with Giles, complicated by a\r\nsense of the intractability of circumstances.\r\n\r\nAt that same hour, and almost at that same minute, there was a\r\nconversation about Winterborne in progress in the village street,\r\nopposite Mr. Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s gates, where Timothy Tangs the elder and Robert\r\nCreedle had accidentally met.\r\n\r\nThe sawyer was asking Creedle if he had heard what was all over the\r\nparish, the skin of his face being drawn two ways on the matter\xe2\x80\x94towards\r\nbrightness in respect of it as news, and towards concern in respect of\r\nit as circumstance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, that poor little lonesome thing, Marty South, is likely to lose\r\nher father. He was almost well, but is much worse again. A man all skin\r\nand grief he ever were, and if he leave Little Hintock for a better\r\nland, won\xe2\x80\x99t it make some difference to your Maister Winterborne,\r\nneighbor Creedle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan I be a prophet in Israel?\xe2\x80\x9d said Creedle. \xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t it! I was only\r\nshaping of such a thing yesterday in my poor, long-seeing way, and all\r\nthe work of the house upon my one shoulders! You know what it means? It\r\nis upon John South\xe2\x80\x99s life that all Mr. Winterborne\xe2\x80\x99s houses hang. If so\r\nbe South die, and so make his decease, thereupon the law is that the\r\nhouses fall without the least chance of absolution into HER hands at\r\nthe House. I told him so; but the words of the faithful be only as\r\nwind!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe news was true. The life\xe2\x80\x94the one fragile life\xe2\x80\x94that had been used as\r\na measuring-tape of time by law, was in danger of being frayed away. It\r\nwas the last of a group of lives which had served this purpose, at the\r\nend of whose breathings the small homestead occupied by South himself,\r\nthe larger one of Giles Winterborne, and half a dozen others that had\r\nbeen in the possession of various Hintock village families for the\r\nprevious hundred years, and were now Winterborne\xe2\x80\x99s, would fall in and\r\nbecome part of the encompassing estate.\r\n\r\nYet a short two months earlier Marty\xe2\x80\x99s father, aged fifty-five years,\r\nthough something of a fidgety, anxious being, would have been looked on\r\nas a man whose existence was so far removed from hazardous as any in\r\nthe parish, and as bidding fair to be prolonged for another quarter of\r\na century.\r\n\r\nWinterborne walked up and down his garden next day thinking of the\r\ncontingency. The sense that the paths he was pacing, the cabbage-plots,\r\nthe apple-trees, his dwelling, cider-cellar, wring-house, stables, and\r\nweathercock, were all slipping away over his head and beneath his feet,\r\nas if they were painted on a magic-lantern slide, was curious. In spite\r\nof John South\xe2\x80\x99s late indisposition he had not anticipated danger. To\r\ninquire concerning his health had been to show less sympathy than to\r\nremain silent, considering the material interest he possessed in the\r\nwoodman\xe2\x80\x99s life, and he had, accordingly, made a point of avoiding\r\nMarty\xe2\x80\x99s house.\r\n\r\nWhile he was here in the garden somebody came to fetch him. It was\r\nMarty herself, and she showed her distress by her unconsciousness of a\r\ncropped poll.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather is still so much troubled in his mind about that tree,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know the tree I mean, Mr. Winterborne? the tall one in front\r\nof the house, that he thinks will blow down and kill us. Can you come\r\nand see if you can persuade him out of his notion? I can do nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe accompanied her to the cottage, and she conducted him upstairs. John\r\nSouth was pillowed up in a chair between the bed and the window exactly\r\nopposite the latter, towards which his face was turned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, neighbor Winterborne,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have minded if my life\r\nhad only been my own to lose; I don\xe2\x80\x99t vallie it in much of itself, and\r\ncan let it go if \xe2\x80\x99tis required of me. But to think what \xe2\x80\x99tis worth to\r\nyou, a young man rising in life, that do trouble me! It seems a trick\r\nof dishonesty towards ye to go off at fifty-five! I could bear up, I\r\nknow I could, if it were not for the tree\xe2\x80\x94yes, the tree, \xe2\x80\x99tis that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nkilling me. There he stands, threatening my life every minute that the\r\nwind do blow. He\xe2\x80\x99ll come down upon us and squat us dead; and what will\r\nye do when the life on your property is taken away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever you mind me\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s of no consequence,\xe2\x80\x9d said Giles. \xe2\x80\x9cThink of\r\nyourself alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked out of the window in the direction of the woodman\xe2\x80\x99s gaze. The\r\ntree was a tall elm, familiar to him from childhood, which stood at a\r\ndistance of two-thirds its own height from the front of South\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndwelling. Whenever the wind blew, as it did now, the tree rocked,\r\nnaturally enough; and the sight of its motion and sound of its sighs\r\nhad gradually bred the terrifying illusion in the woodman\xe2\x80\x99s mind that\r\nit would descend and kill him. Thus he would sit all day, in spite of\r\npersuasion, watching its every sway, and listening to the melancholy\r\nGregorian melodies which the air wrung out of it. This fear it\r\napparently was, rather than any organic disease which was eating away\r\nthe health of John South.\r\n\r\nAs the tree waved, South waved his head, making it his flugel-man with\r\nabject obedience. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, when it was quite a small tree,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\r\nwas a little boy, I thought one day of chopping it off with my hook to\r\nmake a clothes-line prop with. But I put off doing it, and then I again\r\nthought that I would; but I forgot it, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t. And at last it got\r\ntoo big, and now \xe2\x80\x99tis my enemy, and will be the death o\xe2\x80\x99 me. Little did\r\nI think, when I let that sapling stay, that a time would come when it\r\nwould torment me, and dash me into my grave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Winterborne and Marty, soothingly. But they thought it\r\npossible that it might hasten him into his grave, though in another way\r\nthan by falling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you what,\xe2\x80\x9d added Winterborne, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll climb up this afternoon and\r\nshroud off the lower boughs, and then it won\xe2\x80\x99t be so heavy, and the\r\nwind won\xe2\x80\x99t affect it so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe won\xe2\x80\x99t allow it\xe2\x80\x94a strange woman come from nobody knows where\xe2\x80\x94she\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t have it done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean Mrs. Charmond? Oh, she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know there\xe2\x80\x99s such a tree on\r\nher estate. Besides, shrouding is not felling, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll risk that\r\nmuch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went out, and when afternoon came he returned, took a billhook from\r\nthe woodman\xe2\x80\x99s shed, and with a ladder climbed into the lower part of\r\nthe tree, where he began lopping off\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cshrouding,\xe2\x80\x9d as they called it at\r\nHintock\xe2\x80\x94the lowest boughs. Each of these quivered under his attack,\r\nbent, cracked, and fell into the hedge. Having cut away the lowest\r\ntier, he stepped off the ladder, climbed a few steps higher, and\r\nattacked those at the next level. Thus he ascended with the progress of\r\nhis work far above the top of the ladder, cutting away his perches as\r\nhe went, and leaving nothing but a bare stem below him.\r\n\r\nThe work was troublesome, for the tree was large. The afternoon wore\r\non, turning dark and misty about four o\xe2\x80\x99clock. From time to time Giles\r\ncast his eyes across towards the bedroom window of South, where, by the\r\nflickering fire in the chamber, he could see the old man watching him,\r\nsitting motionless with a hand upon each arm of the chair. Beside him\r\nsat Marty, also straining her eyes towards the skyey field of his\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nA curious question suddenly occurred to Winterborne, and he stopped his\r\nchopping. He was operating on another person\xe2\x80\x99s property to prolong the\r\nyears of a lease by whose termination that person would considerably\r\nbenefit. In that aspect of the case he doubted if he ought to go on. On\r\nthe other hand he was working to save a man\xe2\x80\x99s life, and this seemed to\r\nempower him to adopt arbitrary measures.\r\n\r\nThe wind had died down to a calm, and while he was weighing the\r\ncircumstances he saw coming along the road through the increasing mist\r\na figure which, indistinct as it was, he knew well. It was Grace\r\nMelbury, on her way out from the house, probably for a short evening\r\nwalk before dark. He arranged himself for a greeting from her, since\r\nshe could hardly avoid passing immediately beneath the tree.\r\n\r\nBut Grace, though she looked up and saw him, was just at that time too\r\nfull of the words of her father to give him any encouragement. The\r\nyears-long regard that she had had for him was not kindled by her\r\nreturn into a flame of sufficient brilliancy to make her rebellious.\r\nThinking that she might not see him, he cried, \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Melbury, here I\r\nam.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked up again. She was near enough to see the expression of his\r\nface, and the nails in his soles, silver-bright with constant walking.\r\nBut she did not reply; and dropping her glance again, went on.\r\n\r\nWinterborne\xe2\x80\x99s face grew strange; he mused, and proceeded automatically\r\nwith his work. Grace meanwhile had not gone far. She had reached a\r\ngate, whereon she had leaned sadly, and whispered to herself, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\nshall I do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA sudden fog came on, and she curtailed her walk, passing under the\r\ntree again on her return. Again he addressed her. \xe2\x80\x9cGrace,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\nwhen she was close to the trunk, \xe2\x80\x9cspeak to me.\xe2\x80\x9d She shook her head\r\nwithout stopping, and went on to a little distance, where she stood\r\nobserving him from behind the hedge.\r\n\r\nHer coldness had been kindly meant. If it was to be done, she had said\r\nto herself, it should be begun at once. While she stood out of\r\nobservation Giles seemed to recognize her meaning; with a sudden start\r\nhe worked on, climbing higher, and cutting himself off more and more\r\nfrom all intercourse with the sublunary world. At last he had worked\r\nhimself so high up the elm, and the mist had so thickened, that he\r\ncould only just be discerned as a dark-gray spot on the light-gray sky:\r\nhe would have been altogether out of notice but for the stroke of his\r\nbillhook and the flight of a bough downward, and its crash upon the\r\nhedge at intervals.\r\n\r\nIt was not to be done thus, after all: plainness and candor were best.\r\nShe went back a third time; he did not see her now, and she lingeringly\r\ngazed up at his unconscious figure, loath to put an end to any kind of\r\nhope that might live on in him still. \xe2\x80\x9cGiles\xe2\x80\x94 Mr. Winterborne,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nHe was so high amid the fog that he did not hear. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Winterborne!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe cried again, and this time he stopped, looked down, and replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy silence just now was not accident,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in an unequal voice.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father says it is best not to think too much of that\xe2\x80\x94engagement, or\r\nunderstanding between us, that you know of. I, too, think that upon the\r\nwhole he is right. But we are friends, you know, Giles, and almost\r\nrelations.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, as if without surprise, in a voice which\r\nbarely reached down the tree. \xe2\x80\x9cI have nothing to say in objection\xe2\x80\x94I\r\ncannot say anything till I\xe2\x80\x99ve thought a while.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe added, with emotion in her tone, \xe2\x80\x9cFor myself, I would have married\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x94some day\xe2\x80\x94I think. But I give way, for I see it would be unwise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe made no reply, but sat back upon a bough, placed his elbow in a\r\nfork, and rested his head upon his hand. Thus he remained till the fog\r\nand the night had completely enclosed him from her view.\r\n\r\nGrace heaved a divided sigh, with a tense pause between, and moved\r\nonward, her heart feeling uncomfortably big and heavy, and her eyes\r\nwet. Had Giles, instead of remaining still, immediately come down from\r\nthe tree to her, would she have continued in that filial acquiescent\r\nframe of mind which she had announced to him as final? If it be true,\r\nas women themselves have declared, that one of their sex is never so\r\nmuch inclined to throw in her lot with a man for good and all as five\r\nminutes after she has told him such a thing cannot be, the\r\nprobabilities are that something might have been done by the appearance\r\nof Winterborne on the ground beside Grace. But he continued motionless\r\nand silent in that gloomy Niflheim or fog-land which involved him, and\r\nshe proceeded on her way.\r\n\r\nThe spot seemed now to be quite deserted. The light from South\xe2\x80\x99s window\r\nmade rays on the fog, but did not reach the tree. A quarter of an hour\r\npassed, and all was blackness overhead. Giles had not yet come down.\r\n\r\nThen the tree seemed to shiver, then to heave a sigh; a movement was\r\naudible, and Winterborne dropped almost noiselessly to the ground. He\r\nhad thought the matter out, and having returned the ladder and billhook\r\nto their places, pursued his way homeward. He would not allow this\r\nincident to affect his outer conduct any more than the danger to his\r\nleaseholds had done, and went to bed as usual. Two simultaneous\r\ntroubles do not always make a double trouble; and thus it came to pass\r\nthat Giles\xe2\x80\x99s practical anxiety about his houses, which would have been\r\nenough to keep him awake half the night at any other time, was\r\ndisplaced and not reinforced by his sentimental trouble about Grace\r\nMelbury. This severance was in truth more like a burial of her than a\r\nrupture with her; but he did not realize so much at present; even when\r\nhe arose in the morning he felt quite moody and stern: as yet the\r\nsecond note in the gamut of such emotions, a tender regret for his\r\nloss, had not made itself heard.\r\n\r\nA load of oak timber was to be sent away that morning to a builder\r\nwhose works were in a town many miles off. The proud trunks were taken\r\nup from the silent spot which had known them through the buddings and\r\nsheddings of their growth for the foregoing hundred years; chained down\r\nlike slaves to a heavy timber carriage with enormous red wheels, and\r\nfour of the most powerful of Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s horses were harnessed in front\r\nto draw them.\r\n\r\nThe horses wore their bells that day. There were sixteen to the team,\r\ncarried on a frame above each animal\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders, and tuned to scale,\r\nso as to form two octaves, running from the highest note on the right\r\nor off-side of the leader to the lowest on the left or near-side of the\r\nshaft-horse. Melbury was among the last to retain horse-bells in that\r\nneighborhood; for, living at Little Hintock, where the lanes yet\r\nremained as narrow as before the days of turnpike roads, these\r\nsound-signals were still as useful to him and his neighbors as they had\r\never been in former times. Much backing was saved in the course of a\r\nyear by the warning notes they cast ahead; moreover, the tones of all\r\nthe teams in the district being known to the carters of each, they\r\ncould tell a long way off on a dark night whether they were about to\r\nencounter friends or strangers.\r\n\r\nThe fog of the previous evening still lingered so heavily over the\r\nwoods that the morning could not penetrate the trees till long after\r\nits time. The load being a ponderous one, the lane crooked, and the air\r\nso thick, Winterborne set out, as he often did, to accompany the team\r\nas far as the corner, where it would turn into a wider road.\r\n\r\nSo they rumbled on, shaking the foundations of the roadside cottages by\r\nthe weight of their progress, the sixteen bells chiming harmoniously\r\nover all, till they had risen out of the valley and were descending\r\ntowards the more open route, the sparks rising from their creaking skid\r\nand nearly setting fire to the dead leaves alongside.\r\n\r\nThen occurred one of the very incidents against which the bells were an\r\nendeavor to guard. Suddenly there beamed into their eyes, quite close\r\nto them, the two lamps of a carriage, shorn of rays by the fog. Its\r\napproach had been quite unheard, by reason of their own noise. The\r\ncarriage was a covered one, while behind it could be discerned another\r\nvehicle laden with luggage.\r\n\r\nWinterborne went to the head of the team, and heard the coachman\r\ntelling the carter that he must turn back. The carter declared that\r\nthis was impossible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can turn if you unhitch your string-horses,\xe2\x80\x9d said the coachman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is much easier for you to turn than for us,\xe2\x80\x9d said Winterborne.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve five tons of timber on these wheels if we\xe2\x80\x99ve an ounce.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99ve another carriage with luggage at my back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWinterborne admitted the strength of the argument. \xe2\x80\x9cBut even with\r\nthat,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou can back better than we. And you ought to, for you\r\ncould hear our bells half a mile off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you could see our lights.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t, because of the fog.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, our time\xe2\x80\x99s precious,\xe2\x80\x9d said the coachman, haughtily. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are\r\nonly going to some trumpery little village or other in the\r\nneighborhood, while we are going straight to Italy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDriving all the way, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d said Winterborne, sarcastically.\r\n\r\nThe argument continued in these terms till a voice from the interior of\r\nthe carriage inquired what was the matter. It was a lady\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nShe was briefly informed of the timber people\xe2\x80\x99s obstinacy; and then\r\nGiles could hear her telling the footman to direct the timber people to\r\nturn their horses\xe2\x80\x99 heads.\r\n\r\nThe message was brought, and Winterborne sent the bearer back to say\r\nthat he begged the lady\xe2\x80\x99s pardon, but that he could not do as she\r\nrequested; that though he would not assert it to be impossible, it was\r\nimpossible by comparison with the slight difficulty to her party to\r\nback their light carriages. As fate would have it, the incident with\r\nGrace Melbury on the previous day made Giles less gentle than he might\r\notherwise have shown himself, his confidence in the sex being rudely\r\nshaken.\r\n\r\nIn fine, nothing could move him, and the carriages were compelled to\r\nback till they reached one of the sidings or turnouts constructed in\r\nthe bank for the purpose. Then the team came on ponderously, and the\r\nclanging of its sixteen bells as it passed the discomfited carriages,\r\ntilted up against the bank, lent a particularly triumphant tone to the\r\nteam\xe2\x80\x99s progress\xe2\x80\x94a tone which, in point of fact, did not at all attach\r\nto its conductor\xe2\x80\x99s feelings.\r\n\r\nGiles walked behind the timber, and just as he had got past the yet\r\nstationary carriages he heard a soft voice say, \xe2\x80\x9cWho is that rude man?\r\nNot Melbury?\xe2\x80\x9d The sex of the speaker was so prominent in the voice that\r\nWinterborne felt a pang of regret.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. A younger man, in a smaller way of business in Little\r\nHintock. Winterborne is his name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus they parted company. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Mr. Winterborne,\xe2\x80\x9d said the wagoner,\r\nwhen they were out of hearing, \xe2\x80\x9cthat was She\xe2\x80\x94Mrs. Charmond! Who\xe2\x80\x99d ha\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthought it? What in the world can a woman that does nothing be\r\ncock-watching out here at this time o\xe2\x80\x99 day for? Oh, going to Italy\xe2\x80\x94yes\r\nto be sure, I heard she was going abroad, she can\xe2\x80\x99t endure the winter\r\nhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWinterborne was vexed at the incident; the more so that he knew Mr.\r\nMelbury, in his adoration of Hintock House, would be the first to blame\r\nhim if it became known. But saying no more, he accompanied the load to\r\nthe end of the lane, and then turned back with an intention to call at\r\nSouth\xe2\x80\x99s to learn the result of the experiment of the preceding evening.\r\n\r\nIt chanced that a few minutes before this time Grace Melbury, who now\r\nrose soon enough to breakfast with her father, in spite of the\r\nunwontedness of the hour, had been commissioned by him to make the same\r\ninquiry at South\xe2\x80\x99s. Marty had been standing at the door when Miss\r\nMelbury arrived. Almost before the latter had spoken, Mrs. Charmond\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncarriages, released from the obstruction up the lane, came bowling\r\nalong, and the two girls turned to regard the spectacle.\r\n\r\nMrs. Charmond did not see them, but there was sufficient light for them\r\nto discern her outline between the carriage windows. A noticeable\r\nfeature in her _tournure_ was a magnificent mass of braided locks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow well she looks this morning!\xe2\x80\x9d said Grace, forgetting Mrs.\r\nCharmond\xe2\x80\x99s slight in her generous admiration. \xe2\x80\x9cHer hair so becomes her\r\nworn that way. I have never seen any more beautiful!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor have I, miss,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marty, dryly, unconsciously stroking her\r\ncrown.\r\n\r\nGrace watched the carriages with lingering regret till they were out of\r\nsight. She then learned of Marty that South was no better. Before she\r\nhad come away Winterborne approached the house, but seeing that one of\r\nthe two girls standing on the door-step was Grace, he suddenly turned\r\nback again and sought the shelter of his own home till she should have\r\ngone away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe encounter with the carriages having sprung upon Winterborne\xe2\x80\x99s mind\r\nthe image of Mrs. Charmond, his thoughts by a natural channel went from\r\nher to the fact that several cottages and other houses in the two\r\nHintocks, now his own, would fall into her possession in the event of\r\nSouth\xe2\x80\x99s death. He marvelled what people could have been thinking about\r\nin the past to invent such precarious tenures as these; still more,\r\nwhat could have induced his ancestors at Hintock, and other village\r\npeople, to exchange their old copyholds for life-leases. But having\r\nnaturally succeeded to these properties through his father, he had done\r\nhis best to keep them in order, though he was much struck with his\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s negligence in not insuring South\xe2\x80\x99s life.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast, still musing on the circumstances, he went upstairs,\r\nturned over his bed, and drew out a flat canvas bag which lay between\r\nthe mattress and the sacking. In this he kept his leases, which had\r\nremained there unopened ever since his father\xe2\x80\x99s death. It was the usual\r\nhiding-place among rural lifeholders for such documents. Winterborne\r\nsat down on the bed and looked them over. They were ordinary leases for\r\nthree lives, which a member of the South family, some fifty years\r\nbefore this time, had accepted of the lord of the manor in lieu of\r\ncertain copyholds and other rights, in consideration of having the\r\ndilapidated houses rebuilt by said lord. They had come into his\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s possession chiefly through his mother, who was a South.\r\n\r\nPinned to the parchment of one of the indentures was a letter, which\r\nWinterborne had never seen before. It bore a remote date, the\r\nhandwriting being that of some solicitor or agent, and the signature\r\nthe landholder\xe2\x80\x99s. It was to the effect that at any time before the last\r\nof the stated lives should drop, Mr. Giles Winterborne, senior, or his\r\nrepresentative, should have the privilege of adding his own and his\r\nson\xe2\x80\x99s life to the life remaining on payment of a merely nominal sum;\r\nthe concession being in consequence of the elder Winterborne\xe2\x80\x99s consent\r\nto demolish one of the houses and relinquish its site, which stood at\r\nan awkward corner of the lane and impeded the way.\r\n\r\nThe house had been pulled down years before. Why Giles\xe2\x80\x99s father had not\r\ntaken advantage of his privilege to insert his own and his son\xe2\x80\x99s lives\r\nit was impossible to say. The likelihood was that death alone had\r\nhindered him in the execution of his project, as it surely was, the\r\nelder Winterborne having been a man who took much pleasure in dealing\r\nwith house property in his small way.\r\n\r\nSince one of the Souths still survived, there was not much doubt that\r\nGiles could do what his father had left undone, as far as his own life\r\nwas concerned. This possibility cheered him much, for by those houses\r\nhung many things. Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s doubt of the young man\xe2\x80\x99s fitness to be the\r\nhusband of Grace had been based not a little on the precariousness of\r\nhis holdings in Little and Great Hintock. He resolved to attend to the\r\nbusiness at once, the fine for renewal being a sum that he could easily\r\nmuster. His scheme, however, could not be carried out in a day; and\r\nmeanwhile he would run up to South\xe2\x80\x99s, as he had intended to do, to\r\nlearn the result of the experiment with the tree.\r\n\r\nMarty met him at the door. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, Marty,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; and was surprised to\r\nread in her face that the case was not so hopeful as he had imagined.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry for your labor,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is all lost. He says the\r\ntree seems taller than ever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWinterborne looked round at it. Taller the tree certainly did seem, the\r\ngauntness of its now naked stem being more marked than before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt quite terrified him when he first saw what you had done to it this\r\nmorning,\xe2\x80\x9d she added. \xe2\x80\x9cHe declares it will come down upon us and cleave\r\nus, like \xe2\x80\x98the sword of the Lord and of Gideon.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell; can I do anything else?\xe2\x80\x9d asked he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe doctor says the tree ought to be cut down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ve had the doctor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t send for him. Mrs. Charmond, before she left, heard that\r\nfather was ill, and told him to attend him at her expense.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was very good of her. And he says it ought to be cut down. We\r\nmustn\xe2\x80\x99t cut it down without her knowledge, I suppose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went up-stairs. There the old man sat, staring at the now gaunt tree\r\nas if his gaze were frozen on to its trunk. Unluckily the tree waved\r\nafresh by this time, a wind having sprung up and blown the fog away,\r\nand his eyes turned with its wavings.\r\n\r\nThey heard footsteps\xe2\x80\x94a man\xe2\x80\x99s, but of a lighter type than usual. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\r\nis Doctor Fitzpiers again,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and descended. Presently his\r\ntread was heard on the naked stairs.\r\n\r\nMr. Fitzpiers entered the sick-chamber just as a doctor is more or less\r\nwont to do on such occasions, and pre-eminently when the room is that\r\nof a humble cottager, looking round towards the patient with that\r\npreoccupied gaze which so plainly reveals that he has wellnigh\r\nforgotten all about the case and the whole circumstances since he\r\ndismissed them from his mind at his last exit from the same apartment.\r\nHe nodded to Winterborne, with whom he was already a little acquainted,\r\nrecalled the case to his thoughts, and went leisurely on to where South\r\nsat.\r\n\r\nFitzpiers was, on the whole, a finely formed, handsome man. His eyes\r\nwere dark and impressive, and beamed with the light either of energy or\r\nof susceptivity\xe2\x80\x94it was difficult to say which; it might have been a\r\nlittle of both. That quick, glittering, practical eye, sharp for the\r\nsurface of things and for nothing beneath it, he had not. But whether\r\nhis apparent depth of vision was real, or only an artistic accident of\r\nhis corporeal moulding, nothing but his deeds could reveal.\r\n\r\nHis face was rather soft than stern, charming than grand, pale than\r\nflushed; his nose\xe2\x80\x94if a sketch of his features be _de rigueur_ for a\r\nperson of his pretensions\xe2\x80\x94was artistically beautiful enough to have\r\nbeen worth doing in marble by any sculptor not over-busy, and was hence\r\ndevoid of those knotty irregularities which often mean power; while the\r\ndouble-cyma or classical curve of his mouth was not without a looseness\r\nin its close. Nevertheless, either from his readily appreciative mien,\r\nor his reflective manner, or the instinct towards profound things which\r\nwas said to possess him, his presence bespoke the philosopher rather\r\nthan the dandy or macaroni\xe2\x80\x94an effect which was helped by the absence of\r\ntrinkets or other trivialities from his attire, though this was more\r\nfinished and up to date than is usually the case among rural\r\npractitioners.\r\n\r\nStrict people of the highly respectable class, knowing a little about\r\nhim by report, might have said that he seemed likely to err rather in\r\nthe possession of too many ideas than too few; to be a dreamy \xe2\x80\x99ist of\r\nsome sort, or too deeply steeped in some false kind of \xe2\x80\x99ism. However\r\nthis may be, it will be seen that he was undoubtedly a somewhat rare\r\nkind of gentleman and doctor to have descended, as from the clouds,\r\nupon Little Hintock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is an extraordinary case,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last to Winterborne, after\r\nexamining South by conversation, look, and touch, and learning that the\r\ncraze about the elm was stronger than ever. \xe2\x80\x9cCome down-stairs, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ntell you what I think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey accordingly descended, and the doctor continued, \xe2\x80\x9cThe tree must be\r\ncut down, or I won\xe2\x80\x99t answer for his life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis Mrs. Charmond\xe2\x80\x99s tree, and I suppose we must get permission?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nGiles. \xe2\x80\x9cIf so, as she is gone away, I must speak to her agent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x94never mind whose tree it is\xe2\x80\x94what\xe2\x80\x99s a tree beside a life! Cut it\r\ndown. I have not the honor of knowing Mrs. Charmond as yet, but I am\r\ndisposed to risk that much with her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis timber,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Giles, more scrupulous than he would have been\r\nhad not his own interests stood so closely involved. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ll never\r\nfell a stick about here without it being marked first, either by her or\r\nthe agent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen we\xe2\x80\x99ll inaugurate a new era forthwith. How long has he complained\r\nof the tree?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the doctor of Marty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWeeks and weeks, sir. The shape of it seems to haunt him like an evil\r\nspirit. He says that it is exactly his own age, that it has got human\r\nsense, and sprouted up when he was born on purpose to rule him, and\r\nkeep him as its slave. Others have been like it afore in Hintock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey could hear South\xe2\x80\x99s voice up-stairs \xe2\x80\x9cOh, he\xe2\x80\x99s rocking this way; he\r\nmust come! And then my poor life, that\xe2\x80\x99s worth houses upon houses, will\r\nbe squashed out o\xe2\x80\x99 me. Oh! oh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s how he goes on,\xe2\x80\x9d she added. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd he\xe2\x80\x99ll never look anywhere else\r\nbut out of the window, and scarcely have the curtains drawn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDown with it, then, and hang Mrs. Charmond,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Fitzpiers. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nbest plan will be to wait till the evening, when it is dark, or early\r\nin the morning before he is awake, so that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t see it fall, for\r\nthat would terrify him worse than ever. Keep the blind down till I\r\ncome, and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll assure him, and show him that his trouble is over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor then departed, and they waited till the evening. When it was\r\ndusk, and the curtains drawn, Winterborne directed a couple of woodmen\r\nto bring a crosscut-saw, and the tall, threatening tree was soon nearly\r\noff at its base. He would not fell it completely then, on account of\r\nthe possible crash, but next morning, before South was awake, they went\r\nand lowered it cautiously, in a direction away from the cottage. It was\r\na business difficult to do quite silently; but it was done at last, and\r\nthe elm of the same birth-year as the woodman\xe2\x80\x99s lay stretched upon the\r\nground. The weakest idler that passed could now set foot on marks\r\nformerly made in the upper forks by the shoes of adventurous climbers\r\nonly; once inaccessible nests could be examined microscopically; and on\r\nswaying extremities where birds alone had perched, the by-standers sat\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it was broad daylight the doctor came, and Winterborne\r\nentered the house with him. Marty said that her father was wrapped up\r\nand ready, as usual, to be put into his chair. They ascended the\r\nstairs, and soon seated him. He began at once to complain of the tree,\r\nand the danger to his life and Winterborne\xe2\x80\x99s house-property in\r\nconsequence.\r\n\r\nThe doctor signalled to Giles, who went and drew back the printed\r\ncotton curtains. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis gone, see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Fitzpiers.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the old man saw the vacant patch of sky in place of the\r\nbranched column so familiar to his gaze, he sprang up, speechless, his\r\neyes rose from their hollows till the whites showed all round; he fell\r\nback, and a bluish whiteness overspread him.\r\n\r\nGreatly alarmed, they put him on the bed. As soon as he came a little\r\nout of his fit, he gasped, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, it is gone!\xe2\x80\x94where?\xe2\x80\x94where?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis whole system seemed paralyzed by amazement. They were\r\nthunder-struck at the result of the experiment, and did all they could.\r\nNothing seemed to avail. Giles and Fitzpiers went and came, but\r\nuselessly. He lingered through the day, and died that evening as the\r\nsun went down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x94d if my remedy hasn\xe2\x80\x99t killed him!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the doctor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Melbury heard what had happened he seemed much moved, and walked\r\nthoughtfully about the premises. On South\xe2\x80\x99s own account he was\r\ngenuinely sorry; and on Winterborne\xe2\x80\x99s he was the more grieved in that\r\nthis catastrophe had so closely followed the somewhat harsh dismissal\r\nof Giles as the betrothed of his daughter.\r\n\r\nHe was quite angry with circumstances for so heedlessly inflicting on\r\nGiles a second trouble when the needful one inflicted by himself was\r\nall that the proper order of events demanded. \xe2\x80\x9cI told Giles\xe2\x80\x99s father\r\nwhen he came into those houses not to spend too much money on lifehold\r\nproperty held neither for his own life nor his son\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t listen to me. And now Giles has to suffer for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor Giles!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Grace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Grace, between us two, it is very, very remarkable. It is almost\r\nas if I had foreseen this; and I am thankful for your escape, though I\r\nam sincerely sorry for Giles. Had we not dismissed him already, we\r\ncould hardly have found it in our hearts to dismiss him now. So I say,\r\nbe thankful. I\xe2\x80\x99ll do all I can for him as a friend; but as a pretender\r\nto the position of my son-in law, that can never be thought of more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd yet at that very moment the impracticability to which poor\r\nWinterborne\xe2\x80\x99s suit had been reduced was touching Grace\xe2\x80\x99s heart to a\r\nwarmer sentiment on his behalf than she had felt for years concerning\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHe, meanwhile, was sitting down alone in the old familiar house which\r\nhad ceased to be his, taking a calm if somewhat dismal survey of\r\naffairs. The pendulum of the clock bumped every now and then against\r\none side of the case in which it swung, as the muffled drum to his\r\nworldly march. Looking out of the window he could perceive that a\r\nparalysis had come over Creedle\xe2\x80\x99s occupation of manuring the garden,\r\nowing, obviously, to a conviction that they might not be living there\r\nlong enough to profit by next season\xe2\x80\x99s crop.\r\n\r\nHe looked at the leases again and the letter attached. There was no\r\ndoubt that he had lost his houses by an accident which might easily\r\nhave been circumvented if he had known the true conditions of his\r\nholding. The time for performance had now lapsed in strict law; but\r\nmight not the intention be considered by the landholder when she became\r\naware of the circumstances, and his moral right to retain the holdings\r\nfor the term of his life be conceded?\r\n\r\nHis heart sank within him when he perceived that despite all the legal\r\nreciprocities and safeguards prepared and written, the upshot of the\r\nmatter amounted to this, that it depended upon the mere caprice\xe2\x80\x94good or\r\nill\xe2\x80\x94of the woman he had met the day before in such an unfortunate way,\r\nwhether he was to possess his houses for life or no.\r\n\r\nWhile he was sitting and thinking a step came to the door, and Melbury\r\nappeared, looking very sorry for his position. Winterborne welcomed him\r\nby a word and a look, and went on with his examination of the\r\nparchments. His visitor sat down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGiles,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is very awkward, and I am sorry for it. What\r\nare you going to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGiles informed him of the real state of affairs, and how barely he had\r\nmissed availing himself of his chance of renewal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a misfortune! Why was this neglected? Well, the best thing you\r\ncan do is to write and tell her all about it, and throw yourself upon\r\nher generosity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would rather not,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Giles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you must,\xe2\x80\x9d said Melbury.\r\n\r\nIn short, he argued so cogently that Giles allowed himself to be\r\npersuaded, and the letter to Mrs. Charmond was written and sent to\r\nHintock House, whence, as he knew, it would at once be forwarded to\r\nher.\r\n\r\nMelbury feeling that he had done so good an action in coming as almost\r\nto extenuate his previous arbitrary conduct to nothing, went home; and\r\nGiles was left alone to the suspense of waiting for a reply from the\r\ndivinity who shaped the ends of the Hintock population. By this time\r\nall the villagers knew of the circumstances, and being wellnigh like\r\none family, a keen interest was the result all round.\r\n\r\nEverybody thought of Giles; nobody thought of Marty. Had any of them\r\nlooked in upon her during those moonlight nights which preceded the\r\nburial of her father, they would have seen the girl absolutely alone in\r\nthe house with the dead man. Her own chamber being nearest the stairs,\r\nthe coffin had been placed there for convenience; and at a certain hour\r\nof the night, when the moon arrived opposite the window, its beams\r\nstreamed across the still profile of South, sublimed by the august\r\npresence of death, and onward a few feet farther upon the face of his\r\ndaughter, lying in her little bed in the stillness of a repose almost\r\nas dignified as that of her companion\xe2\x80\x94the repose of a guileless soul\r\nthat had nothing more left on earth to lose, except a life which she\r\ndid not overvalue.\r\n\r\nSouth was buried, and a week passed, and Winterborne watched for a\r\nreply from Mrs. Charmond. Melbury was very sanguine as to its tenor;\r\nbut Winterborne had not told him of the encounter with her carriage,\r\nwhen, if ever he had heard an affronted tone on a woman\xe2\x80\x99s lips, he had\r\nheard it on hers.\r\n\r\nThe postman\xe2\x80\x99s time for passing was just after Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s men had\r\nassembled in the spar-house; and Winterborne, who when not busy on his\r\nown account would lend assistance there, used to go out into the lane\r\nevery morning and meet the post-man at the end of one of the green\r\nrides through the hazel copse, in the straight stretch of which his\r\nladen figure could be seen a long way off. Grace also was very anxious;\r\nmore anxious than her father; more, perhaps, than Winterborne himself.\r\nThis anxiety led her into the spar-house on some pretext or other\r\nalmost every morning while they were awaiting the reply.\r\n\r\nFitzpiers too, though he did not personally appear, was much\r\ninterested, and not altogether easy in his mind; for he had been\r\ninformed by an authority of what he had himself conjectured, that if\r\nthe tree had been allowed to stand, the old man would have gone on\r\ncomplaining, but might have lived for twenty years.\r\n\r\nEleven times had Winterborne gone to that corner of the ride, and\r\nlooked up its long straight slope through the wet grays of winter dawn.\r\nBut though the postman\xe2\x80\x99s bowed figure loomed in view pretty regularly,\r\nhe brought nothing for Giles. On the twelfth day the man of missives,\r\nwhile yet in the extreme distance, held up his hand, and Winterborne\r\nsaw a letter in it. He took it into the spar-house before he broke the\r\nseal, and those who were there gathered round him while he read, Grace\r\nlooking in at the door.\r\n\r\nThe letter was not from Mrs. Charmond herself, but her agent at\r\nSherton. Winterborne glanced it over and looked up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all over,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said they altogether.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer lawyer is instructed to say that Mrs. Charmond sees no reason for\r\ndisturbing the natural course of things, particularly as she\r\ncontemplates pulling the houses down,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, quietly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly think of that!\xe2\x80\x9d said several.\r\n\r\nWinterborne had turned away, and said vehemently to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cThen let\r\nher pull \xe2\x80\x99em down, and be d\xe2\x80\x94d to her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCreedle looked at him with a face of seven sorrows, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cAh, \xe2\x80\x99twas\r\nthat sperrit that lost \xe2\x80\x99em for ye, maister!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWinterborne subdued his feelings, and from that hour, whatever they\r\nwere, kept them entirely to himself. There could be no doubt that, up\r\nto this last moment, he had nourished a feeble hope of regaining Grace\r\nin the event of this negotiation turning out a success. Not being aware\r\nof the fact that her father could have settled upon her a fortune\r\nsufficient to enable both to live in comfort, he deemed it now an\r\nabsurdity to dream any longer of such a vanity as making her his wife,\r\nand sank into silence forthwith.\r\n\r\nYet whatever the value of taciturnity to a man among strangers, it is\r\napt to express more than talkativeness when he dwells among friends.\r\nThe countryman who is obliged to judge the time of day from changes in\r\nexternal nature sees a thousand successive tints and traits in the\r\nlandscape which are never discerned by him who hears the regular chime\r\nof a clock, because they are never in request. In like manner do we use\r\nour eyes on our taciturn comrade. The infinitesimal movement of muscle,\r\ncurve, hair, and wrinkle, which when accompanied by a voice goes\r\nunregarded, is watched and translated in the lack of it, till virtually\r\nthe whole surrounding circle of familiars is charged with the reserved\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s moods and meanings.\r\n\r\nThis was the condition of affairs between Winterborne and his neighbors\r\nafter his stroke of ill-luck. He held his tongue; and they observed\r\nhim, and knew that he was discomposed.\r\n\r\nMr. Melbury, in his compunction, thought more of the matter than any\r\none else, except his daughter. Had Winterborne been going on in the old\r\nfashion, Grace\xe2\x80\x99s father could have alluded to his disapproval of the\r\nalliance every day with the greatest frankness; but to speak any\r\nfurther on the subject he could not find it in his heart to do now. He\r\nhoped that Giles would of his own accord make some final announcement\r\nthat he entirely withdrew his pretensions to Grace, and so get the\r\nthing past and done with. For though Giles had in a measure acquiesced\r\nin the wish of her family, he could make matters unpleasant if he chose\r\nto work upon Grace; and hence, when Melbury saw the young man\r\napproaching along the road one day, he kept friendliness and frigidity\r\nexactly balanced in his eye till he could see whether Giles\xe2\x80\x99s manner\r\nwas presumptive or not.\r\n\r\nHis manner was that of a man who abandoned all claims. \xe2\x80\x9cI am glad to\r\nmeet ye, Mr. Melbury,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in a low voice, whose quality he\r\nendeavored to make as practical as possible. \xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid I shall not\r\nbe able to keep that mare I bought, and as I don\xe2\x80\x99t care to sell her, I\r\nshould like\xe2\x80\x94if you don\xe2\x80\x99t object\xe2\x80\x94to give her to Miss Melbury. The horse\r\nis very quiet, and would be quite safe for her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Melbury was rather affected at this. \xe2\x80\x9cYou sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t hurt your pocket\r\nlike that on our account, Giles. Grace shall have the horse, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\npay you what you gave for her, and any expense you may have been put to\r\nfor her keep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe would not hear of any other terms, and thus it was arranged. They\r\nwere now opposite Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s house, and the timber-merchant pressed\r\nWinterborne to enter, Grace being out of the way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPull round the settle, Giles,\xe2\x80\x9d said the timber-merchant, as soon as\r\nthey were within. \xe2\x80\x9cI should like to have a serious talk with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThereupon he put the case to Winterborne frankly, and in quite a\r\nfriendly way. He declared that he did not like to be hard on a man when\r\nhe was in difficulty; but he really did not see how Winterborne could\r\nmarry his daughter now, without even a house to take her to.\r\n\r\nGiles quite acquiesced in the awkwardness of his situation. But from a\r\nmomentary feeling that he would like to know Grace\xe2\x80\x99s mind from her own\r\nlips, he did not speak out positively there and then. He accordingly\r\ndeparted somewhat abruptly, and went home to consider whether he would\r\nseek to bring about a meeting with her.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, while he sat quietly pondering, he fancied that he\r\nheard a scraping on the wall outside his house. The boughs of a monthly\r\nrose which grew there made such a noise sometimes, but as no wind was\r\nstirring he knew that it could not be the rose-tree. He took up the\r\ncandle and went out. Nobody was near. As he turned, the light flickered\r\non the whitewashed rough case of the front, and he saw words written\r\nthereon in charcoal, which he read as follows:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Giles, you\xe2\x80\x99ve lost your dwelling-place,\r\nAnd therefore, Giles, you\xe2\x80\x99ll lose your Grace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nGiles went in-doors. He had his suspicions as to the scrawler of those\r\nlines, but he could not be sure. What suddenly filled his heart far\r\nmore than curiosity about their authorship was a terrible belief that\r\nthey were turning out to be true, try to see Grace as he might. They\r\ndecided the question for him. He sat down and wrote a formal note to\r\nMelbury, in which he briefly stated that he was placed in such a\r\nposition as to make him share to the full Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s view of his own and\r\nhis daughter\xe2\x80\x99s promise, made some years before; to wish that it should\r\nbe considered as cancelled, and they themselves quite released from any\r\nobligation on account of it.\r\n\r\nHaving fastened up this their plenary absolution, he determined to get\r\nit out of his hands and have done with it; to which end he went off to\r\nMelbury\xe2\x80\x99s at once. It was now so late that the family had all retired;\r\nhe crept up to the house, thrust the note under the door, and stole\r\naway as silently as he had come.\r\n\r\nMelbury himself was the first to rise the next morning, and when he had\r\nread the letter his relief was great. \xe2\x80\x9cVery honorable of Giles, very\r\nhonorable,\xe2\x80\x9d he kept saying to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall not forget him. Now to\r\nkeep her up to her own true level.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt happened that Grace went out for an early ramble that morning,\r\npassing through the door and gate while her father was in the\r\nspar-house. To go in her customary direction she could not avoid\r\npassing Winterborne\xe2\x80\x99s house. The morning sun was shining flat upon its\r\nwhite surface, and the words, which still remained, were immediately\r\nvisible to her. She read them. Her face flushed to crimson. She could\r\nsee Giles and Creedle talking together at the back; the charred\r\nspar-gad with which the lines had been written lay on the ground\r\nbeneath the wall. Feeling pretty sure that Winterborne would observe\r\nher action, she quickly went up to the wall, rubbed out \xe2\x80\x9close\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\ninserted \xe2\x80\x9ckeep\xe2\x80\x9d in its stead. Then she made the best of her way home\r\nwithout looking behind her. Giles could draw an inference now if he\r\nchose.\r\n\r\nThere could not be the least doubt that gentle Grace was warming to\r\nmore sympathy with, and interest in, Giles Winterborne than ever she\r\nhad done while he was her promised lover; that since his misfortune\r\nthose social shortcomings of his, which contrasted so awkwardly with\r\nher later experiences of life, had become obscured by the generous\r\nrevival of an old romantic attachment to him. Though mentally trained\r\nand tilled into foreignness of view, as compared with her youthful\r\ntime, Grace was not an ambitious girl, and might, if left to herself,\r\nhave declined Winterborne without much discontent or unhappiness. Her\r\nfeelings just now were so far from latent that the writing on the wall\r\nhad thus quickened her to an unusual rashness.\r\n\r\nHaving returned from her walk she sat at breakfast silently. When her\r\nstep-mother had left the room she said to her father, \xe2\x80\x9cI have made up\r\nmy mind that I should like my engagement to Giles to continue, for the\r\npresent at any rate, till I can see further what I ought to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMelbury looked much surprised.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, sharply. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you are talking\r\nabout. Look here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe handed across to her the letter received from Giles.\r\n\r\nShe read it, and said no more. Could he have seen her write on the\r\nwall? She did not know. Fate, it seemed, would have it this way, and\r\nthere was nothing to do but to acquiesce.\r\n\r\nIt was a few hours after this that Winterborne, who, curiously enough,\r\nhad _not_ perceived Grace writing, was clearing away the tree from the\r\nfront of South\xe2\x80\x99s late dwelling. He saw Marty standing in her door-way,\r\na slim figure in meagre black, almost without womanly contours as yet.\r\nHe went up to her and said, \xe2\x80\x9cMarty, why did you write that on my wall\r\nlast night? It _was_ you, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause it was the truth. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to let it stay, Mr.\r\nWinterborne; but when I was going to rub it out you came, and I was\r\nobliged to run off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaving prophesied one thing, why did you alter it to another? Your\r\npredictions can\xe2\x80\x99t be worth much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not altered it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is altered. Go and see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe went, and read that, in spite of losing his dwelling-place, he\r\nwould _keep_ his Grace. Marty came back surprised.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I never,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWho can have made such nonsense of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho, indeed?\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have rubbed it all out, as the point of it is quite gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d no business to rub it out. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell you to. I meant to let\r\nit stay a little longer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome idle boy did it, no doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured.\r\n\r\nAs this seemed very probable, and the actual perpetrator was\r\nunsuspected, Winterborne said no more, and dismissed the matter from\r\nhis mind.\r\n\r\nFrom this day of his life onward for a considerable time, Winterborne,\r\nthough not absolutely out of his house as yet, retired into the\r\nbackground of human life and action thereabout\xe2\x80\x94a feat not particularly\r\ndifficult of performance anywhere when the doer has the assistance of a\r\nlost prestige. Grace, thinking that Winterborne saw her write, made no\r\nfurther sign, and the frail bark of fidelity that she had thus timidly\r\nlaunched was stranded and lost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Fitzpiers lived on the slope of the hill, in a house of much less\r\npretension, both as to architecture and as to magnitude, than the\r\ntimber-merchant\xe2\x80\x99s. The latter had, without doubt, been once the\r\nmanorial residence appertaining to the snug and modest domain of Little\r\nHintock, of which the boundaries were now lost by its absorption with\r\nothers of its kind into the adjoining estate of Mrs. Charmond. Though\r\nthe Melburys themselves were unaware of the fact, there was every\r\nreason to believe\xe2\x80\x94at least so the parson said\xe2\x80\x94that the owners of that\r\nlittle manor had been Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s own ancestors, the family name\r\noccurring in numerous documents relating to transfers of land about the\r\ntime of the civil wars.\r\n\r\nMr. Fitzpiers\xe2\x80\x99s dwelling, on the contrary, was small, cottage-like, and\r\ncomparatively modern. It had been occupied, and was in part occupied\r\nstill, by a retired farmer and his wife, who, on the surgeon\xe2\x80\x99s arrival\r\nin quest of a home, had accommodated him by receding from their front\r\nrooms into the kitchen quarter, whence they administered to his wants,\r\nand emerged at regular intervals to receive from him a not unwelcome\r\naddition to their income.\r\n\r\nThe cottage and its garden were so regular in their arrangement that\r\nthey might have been laid out by a Dutch designer of the time of\r\nWilliam and Mary. In a low, dense hedge, cut to wedge-shape, was a door\r\nover which the hedge formed an arch, and from the inside of the door a\r\nstraight path, bordered with clipped box, ran up the slope of the\r\ngarden to the porch, which was exactly in the middle of the house\r\nfront, with two windows on each side. Right and left of the path were\r\nfirst a bed of gooseberry bushes; next of currant; next of raspberry;\r\nnext of strawberry; next of old-fashioned flowers; at the corners\r\nopposite the porch being spheres of box resembling a pair of school\r\nglobes. Over the roof of the house could be seen the orchard, on yet\r\nhigher ground, and behind the orchard the forest-trees, reaching up to\r\nthe crest of the hill.\r\n\r\nOpposite the garden door and visible from the parlor window was a\r\nswing-gate leading into a field, across which there ran a footpath. The\r\nswing-gate had just been repainted, and on one fine afternoon, before\r\nthe paint was dry, and while gnats were still dying thereon, the\r\nsurgeon was standing in his sitting-room abstractedly looking out at\r\nthe different pedestrians who passed and repassed along that route.\r\nBeing of a philosophical stamp, he perceived that the character of each\r\nof these travellers exhibited itself in a somewhat amusing manner by\r\nhis or her method of handling the gate.\r\n\r\nAs regarded the men, there was not much variety: they gave the gate a\r\nkick and passed through. The women were more contrasting. To them the\r\nsticky wood-work was a barricade, a disgust, a menace, a treachery, as\r\nthe case might be.\r\n\r\nThe first that he noticed was a bouncing woman with her skirts tucked\r\nup and her hair uncombed. She grasped the gate without looking, giving\r\nit a supplementary push with her shoulder, when the white imprint drew\r\nfrom her an exclamation in language not too refined. She went to the\r\ngreen bank, sat down and rubbed herself in the grass, cursing the\r\nwhile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa! ha! ha!\xe2\x80\x9d laughed the doctor.\r\n\r\nThe next was a girl, with her hair cropped short, in whom the surgeon\r\nrecognized the daughter of his late patient, the woodman South.\r\nMoreover, a black bonnet that she wore by way of mourning unpleasantly\r\nreminded him that he had ordered the felling of a tree which had caused\r\nher parent\xe2\x80\x99s death and Winterborne\xe2\x80\x99s losses. She walked and thought,\r\nand not recklessly; but her preoccupation led her to grasp\r\nunsuspectingly the bar of the gate, and touch it with her arm.\r\nFitzpiers felt sorry that she should have soiled that new black frock,\r\npoor as it was, for it was probably her only one. She looked at her\r\nhand and arm, seemed but little surprised, wiped off the disfigurement\r\nwith an almost unmoved face, and as if without abandoning her original\r\nthoughts. Thus she went on her way.\r\n\r\nThen there came over the green quite a different sort of personage. She\r\nwalked as delicately as if she had been bred in town, and as firmly as\r\nif she had been bred in the country; she seemed one who dimly knew her\r\nappearance to be attractive, but who retained some of the charm of\r\nbeing ignorant of that fact by forgetting it in a general pensiveness.\r\nShe approached the gate. To let such a creature touch it even with a\r\ntip of her glove was to Fitzpiers almost like letting her proceed to\r\ntragical self-destruction. He jumped up and looked for his hat, but was\r\nunable to find the right one; glancing again out of the window he saw\r\nthat he was too late. Having come up, she stopped, looked at the gate,\r\npicked up a little stick, and using it as a bayonet, pushed open the\r\nobstacle without touching it at all.\r\n\r\nHe steadily watched her till she had passed out of sight, recognizing\r\nher as the very young lady whom he had seen once before and been unable\r\nto identify. Whose could that emotional face be? All the others he had\r\nseen in Hintock as yet oppressed him with their crude rusticity; the\r\ncontrast offered by this suggested that she hailed from elsewhere.\r\n\r\nPrecisely these thoughts had occurred to him at the first time of\r\nseeing her; but he now went a little further with them, and considered\r\nthat as there had been no carriage seen or heard lately in that spot\r\nshe could not have come a very long distance. She must be somebody\r\nstaying at Hintock House? Possibly Mrs. Charmond, of whom he had heard\r\nso much\xe2\x80\x94at any rate an inmate, and this probability was sufficient to\r\nset a mild radiance in the surgeon\xe2\x80\x99s somewhat dull sky.\r\n\r\nFitzpiers sat down to the book he had been perusing. It happened to be\r\nthat of a German metaphysician, for the doctor was not a practical man,\r\nexcept by fits, and much preferred the ideal world to the real, and the\r\ndiscovery of principles to their application. The young lady remained\r\nin his thoughts. He might have followed her; but he was not\r\nconstitutionally active, and preferred a conjectural pursuit. However,\r\nwhen he went out for a ramble just before dusk he insensibly took the\r\ndirection of Hintock House, which was the way that Grace had been\r\nwalking, it having happened that her mind had run on Mrs. Charmond that\r\nday, and she had walked to the brow of a hill whence the house could be\r\nseen, returning by another route.\r\n\r\nFitzpiers in his turn reached the edge of the glen, overlooking the\r\nmanor-house. The shutters were shut, and only one chimney smoked. The\r\nmere aspect of the place was enough to inform him that Mrs. Charmond\r\nhad gone away and that nobody else was staying there. Fitzpiers felt a\r\nvague disappointment that the young lady was not Mrs. Charmond, of whom\r\nhe had heard so much; and without pausing longer to gaze at a carcass\r\nfrom which the spirit had flown, he bent his steps homeward.\r\n\r\nLater in the evening Fitzpiers was summoned to visit a cottage patient\r\nabout two miles distant. Like the majority of young practitioners in\r\nhis position he was far from having assumed the dignity of being driven\r\nhis rounds by a servant in a brougham that flashed the sunlight like a\r\nmirror; his way of getting about was by means of a gig which he drove\r\nhimself, hitching the rein of the horse to the gate post, shutter hook,\r\nor garden paling of the domicile under visitation, or giving pennies to\r\nlittle boys to hold the animal during his stay\xe2\x80\x94pennies which were well\r\nearned when the cases to be attended were of a certain cheerful kind\r\nthat wore out the patience of the little boys.\r\n\r\nOn this account of travelling alone, the night journeys which Fitzpiers\r\nhad frequently to take were dismal enough, a serious apparent\r\nperversity in nature ruling that whenever there was to be a birth in a\r\nparticularly inaccessible and lonely place, that event should occur in\r\nthe night. The surgeon, having been of late years a town man, hated the\r\nsolitary midnight woodland. He was not altogether skilful with the\r\nreins, and it often occurred to his mind that if in some remote depths\r\nof the trees an accident were to happen, the fact of his being alone\r\nmight be the death of him. Hence he made a practice of picking up any\r\ncountryman or lad whom he chanced to pass by, and under the disguise of\r\ntreating him to a nice drive, obtained his companionship on the\r\njourney, and his convenient assistance in opening gates.\r\n\r\nThe doctor had started on his way out of the village on the night in\r\nquestion when the light of his lamps fell upon the musing form of\r\nWinterborne, walking leisurely along, as if he had no object in life.\r\nWinterborne was a better class of companion than the doctor usually\r\ncould get, and he at once pulled up and asked him if he would like a\r\ndrive through the wood that fine night.\r\n\r\nGiles seemed rather surprised at the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s friendliness, but said\r\nthat he had no objection, and accordingly mounted beside Mr. Fitzpiers.\r\n\r\nThey drove along under the black boughs which formed a network upon the\r\nstars, all the trees of a species alike in one respect, and no two of\r\nthem alike in another. Looking up as they passed under a horizontal\r\nbough they sometimes saw objects like large tadpoles lodged\r\ndiametrically across it, which Giles explained to be pheasants there at\r\nroost; and they sometimes heard the report of a gun, which reminded him\r\nthat others knew what those tadpole shapes represented as well as he.\r\n\r\nPresently the doctor said what he had been going to say for some time:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there a young lady staying in this neighborhood\xe2\x80\x94a very attractive\r\ngirl\xe2\x80\x94with a little white boa round her neck, and white fur round her\r\ngloves?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWinterborne of course knew in a moment that Grace, whom he had caught\r\nthe doctor peering at, was represented by these accessories. With a\r\nwary grimness, partly in his character, partly induced by the\r\ncircumstances, he evaded an answer by saying, \xe2\x80\x9cI saw a young lady\r\ntalking to Mrs. Charmond the other day; perhaps it was she.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFitzpiers concluded from this that Winterborne had not seen him looking\r\nover the hedge. \xe2\x80\x9cIt might have been,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is quite a\r\ngentlewoman\xe2\x80\x94the one I mean. She cannot be a permanent resident in\r\nHintock or I should have seen her before. Nor does she look like one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is not staying at Hintock House?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; it is closed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen perhaps she is staying at one of the cottages, or farmhouses?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no\xe2\x80\x94you mistake. She was a different sort of girl altogether.\xe2\x80\x9d As\r\nGiles was nobody, Fitzpiers treated him accordingly, and apostrophized\r\nthe night in continuation:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe moved upon this earth a shape of brightness,\r\nA power, that from its objects scarcely drew\r\nOne impulse of her being\xe2\x80\x94in her lightness\r\nMost like some radiant cloud of morning dew,\r\nWhich wanders through the waste air\xe2\x80\x99s pathless blue,\r\nTo nourish some far desert: she did seem\r\nBeside me, gathering beauty as she grew,\r\nLike the bright shade of some immortal dream\r\nWhich walks, when tempests sleep, the wave of life\xe2\x80\x99s dark stream.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe consummate charm of the lines seemed to Winterborne, though he\r\ndivined that they were a quotation, to be somehow the result of his\r\nlost love\xe2\x80\x99s charms upon Fitzpiers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou seem to be mightily in love with her, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with a\r\nsensation of heart-sickness, and more than ever resolved not to mention\r\nGrace by name.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no\xe2\x80\x94I am not that, Winterborne; people living insulated, as I do by\r\nthe solitude of this place, get charged with emotive fluid like a\r\nLeyden-jar with electric, for want of some conductor at hand to\r\ndisperse it. Human love is a subjective thing\xe2\x80\x94the essence itself of\r\nman, as that great thinker Spinoza the philosopher says\xe2\x80\x94_ipsa hominis\r\nessentia_\xe2\x80\x94it is joy accompanied by an idea which we project against any\r\nsuitable object in the line of our vision, just as the rainbow iris is\r\nprojected against an oak, ash, or elm tree indifferently. So that if\r\nany other young lady had appeared instead of the one who did appear, I\r\nshould have felt just the same interest in her, and have quoted\r\nprecisely the same lines from Shelley about her, as about this one I\r\nsaw. Such miserable creatures of circumstance are we all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it is what we call being in love down in these parts, whether or\r\nno,\xe2\x80\x9d said Winterborne.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are right enough if you admit that I am in love with something in\r\nmy own head, and no thing in itself outside it at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it part of a country doctor\xe2\x80\x99s duties to learn that view of things,\r\nmay I ask, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d said Winterborne, adopting the Socratic \xce\xb5\xe1\xbc\xb0\xcf\x81\xcf\x89\xce\xbd\xce\xb5\xe1\xbd\xb7\xce\xb1 with\r\nsuch well-assumed simplicity that Fitzpiers answered, readily,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no. The real truth is, Winterborne, that medical practice in places\r\nlike this is a very rule-of-thumb matter; a bottle of bitter stuff for\r\nthis and that old woman\xe2\x80\x94the bitterer the better\xe2\x80\x94compounded from a few\r\nsimple stereotyped prescriptions; occasional attendance at births,\r\nwhere mere presence is almost sufficient, so healthy and strong are the\r\npeople; and a lance for an abscess now and then. Investigation and\r\nexperiment cannot be carried on without more appliances than one has\r\nhere\xe2\x80\x94though I have attempted it a little.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGiles did not enter into this view of the case; what he had been struck\r\nwith was the curious parallelism between Mr. Fitzpiers\xe2\x80\x99s manner and\r\nGrace\xe2\x80\x99s, as shown by the fact of both of them straying into a subject\r\nof discourse so engrossing to themselves that it made them forget it\r\nwas foreign to him.\r\n\r\nNothing further passed between himself and the doctor in relation to\r\nGrace till they were on their way back. They had stopped at a way-side\r\ninn for a glass of brandy and cider hot, and when they were again in\r\nmotion, Fitzpiers, possibly a little warmed by the liquor, resumed the\r\nsubject by saying, \xe2\x80\x9cI should like very much to know who that young lady\r\nwas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat difference can it make, if she\xe2\x80\x99s only the tree your rainbow falls\r\non?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa! ha! True.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have no wife, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no wife, and no idea of one. I hope to do better things than\r\nmarry and settle in Hintock. Not but that it is well for a medical man\r\nto be married, and sometimes, begad, \xe2\x80\x99twould be pleasant enough in this\r\nplace, with the wind roaring round the house, and the rain and the\r\nboughs beating against it. I hear that you lost your life-holds by the\r\ndeath of South?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did. I lost in more ways than one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey had reached the top of Hintock Lane or Street, if it could be\r\ncalled such where three-quarters of the road-side consisted of copse\r\nand orchard. One of the first houses to be passed was Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s. A\r\nlight was shining from a bedroom window facing lengthwise of the lane.\r\nWinterborne glanced at it, and saw what was coming. He had withheld an\r\nanswer to the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s inquiry to hinder his knowledge of Grace; but,\r\nas he thought to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cwho hath gathered the wind in his fists? who\r\nhath bound the waters in a garment?\xe2\x80\x9d he could not hinder what was\r\ndoomed to arrive, and might just as well have been outspoken. As they\r\ncame up to the house, Grace\xe2\x80\x99s figure was distinctly visible, drawing\r\nthe two white curtains together which were used here instead of blinds.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, there she is!\xe2\x80\x9d said Fitzpiers. \xe2\x80\x9cHow does she come there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the most natural way in the world. It is her home. Mr. Melbury is\r\nher father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, indeed\xe2\x80\x94indeed\xe2\x80\x94indeed! How comes he to have a daughter of that\r\nstamp?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWinterborne laughed coldly. \xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t money do anything,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cif\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve promising material to work upon? Why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t a Hintock girl,\r\ntaken early from home, and put under proper instruction, become as\r\nfinished as any other young lady, if she\xe2\x80\x99s got brains and good looks to\r\nbegin with?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo reason at all why she shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the surgeon, with\r\nreflective disappointment. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly I didn\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate quite that kind of\r\norigin for her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you think an inch or two less of her now.\xe2\x80\x9d There was a little\r\ntremor in Winterborne\xe2\x80\x99s voice as he spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor, with recovered warmth, \xe2\x80\x9cI am not so sure that\r\nI think less of her. At first it was a sort of blow; but, dammy! I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nstick up for her. She\xe2\x80\x99s charming, every inch of her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo she is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Winterborne, \xe2\x80\x9cbut not to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrom this ambiguous expression of the reticent woodlander\xe2\x80\x99s, Dr.\r\nFitzpiers inferred that Giles disliked Miss Melbury because of some\r\nhaughtiness in her bearing towards him, and had, on that account,\r\nwithheld her name. The supposition did not tend to diminish his\r\nadmiration for her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nGrace\xe2\x80\x99s exhibition of herself, in the act of pulling-to the\r\nwindow-curtains, had been the result of an unfortunate incident in the\r\nhouse that day\xe2\x80\x94nothing less than the illness of Grammer Oliver, a woman\r\nwho had never till now lain down for such a reason in her life. Like\r\nothers to whom unbroken years of health has made the idea of keeping\r\ntheir bed almost as repugnant as death itself, she had continued on\r\nfoot till she literally fell on the floor; and though she had, as yet,\r\nbeen scarcely a day off duty, she had sickened into quite a different\r\npersonage from the independent Grammer of the yard and spar-house. Ill\r\nas she was, on one point she was firm. On no account would she see a\r\ndoctor; in other words, Fitzpiers.\r\n\r\nThe room in which Grace had been discerned was not her own, but the old\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s. On the girl\xe2\x80\x99s way to bed she had received a message from\r\nGrammer, to the effect that she would much like to speak to her that\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nGrace entered, and set the candle on a low chair beside the bed, so\r\nthat the profile of Grammer as she lay cast itself in a keen shadow\r\nupon the whitened wall, her large head being still further magnified by\r\nan enormous turban, which was, really, her petticoat wound in a wreath\r\nround her temples. Grace put the room a little in order, and\r\napproaching the sick woman, said, \xe2\x80\x9cI am come, Grammer, as you wish. Do\r\nlet us send for the doctor before it gets later.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not have him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Grammer Oliver, decisively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen somebody to sit up with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t abear it! No; I wanted to see you, Miss Grace, because \xe2\x80\x99ch have\r\nsomething on my mind. Dear Miss Grace, _I took that money of the\r\ndoctor, after all!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat money?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe ten pounds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrace did not quite understand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe ten pounds he offered me for my head, because I\xe2\x80\x99ve a large brain.\r\nI signed a paper when I took the money, not feeling concerned about it\r\nat all. I have not liked to tell ye that it was really settled with\r\nhim, because you showed such horror at the notion. Well, having thought\r\nit over more at length, I wish I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t done it; and it weighs upon my\r\nmind. John South\xe2\x80\x99s death of fear about the tree makes me think that I\r\nshall die of this....\xe2\x80\x99Ch have been going to ask him again to let me\r\noff, but I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t the face.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve spent some of the money\xe2\x80\x94more\xe2\x80\x99n two pounds o\xe2\x80\x99t. It do wherrit me\r\nterribly; and I shall die o\xe2\x80\x99 the thought of that paper I signed with my\r\nholy cross, as South died of his trouble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you ask him to burn the paper he will, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, and think no more\r\nof it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Ch have done it once already, miss. But he laughed cruel like. \xe2\x80\x98Yours\r\nis such a fine brain, Grammer,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99er said, \xe2\x80\x98that science couldn\xe2\x80\x99t afford\r\nto lose you. Besides, you\xe2\x80\x99ve taken my money.\xe2\x80\x99...Don\xe2\x80\x99t let your father\r\nknow of this, please, on no account whatever!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no. I will let you have the money to return to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrammer rolled her head negatively upon the pillow. \xe2\x80\x9cEven if I should\r\nbe well enough to take it to him, he won\xe2\x80\x99t like it. Though why he\r\nshould so particular want to look into the works of a poor old woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhead-piece like mine when there\xe2\x80\x99s so many other folks about, I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow. I know how he\xe2\x80\x99ll answer me: \xe2\x80\x98A lonely person like you, Grammer,\xe2\x80\x99\r\ner woll say. \xe2\x80\x98What difference is it to you what becomes of ye when the\r\nbreath\xe2\x80\x99s out of your body?\xe2\x80\x99 Oh, it do trouble me! If you only knew how\r\nhe do chevy me round the chimmer in my dreams, you\xe2\x80\x99d pity me. How I\r\ncould do it I can\xe2\x80\x99t think! But \xe2\x80\x99ch was always so rackless!...If I only\r\nhad anybody to plead for me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Melbury would, I am sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy; but he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hearken to she! It wants a younger face than hers\r\nto work upon such as he.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrace started with comprehension. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t think he would do it for\r\nme?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t he!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t go to him, Grammer, on any account. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know him at\r\nall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, if I were a young lady,\xe2\x80\x9d said the artful Grammer, \xe2\x80\x9cand could save\r\na poor old woman\xe2\x80\x99s skellington from a heathen doctor instead of a\r\nChristian grave, I would do it, and be glad to. But nobody will do\r\nanything for a poor old familiar friend but push her out of the way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are very ungrateful, Grammer, to say that. But you are ill, I\r\nknow, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why you speak so. Now believe me, you are not going to\r\ndie yet. Remember you told me yourself that you meant to keep him\r\nwaiting many a year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, one can joke when one is well, even in old age; but in sickness\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s gayety falters to grief; and that which seemed small looks large;\r\nand the grim far-off seems near.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrace\xe2\x80\x99s eyes had tears in them. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like to go to him on such an\r\nerrand, Grammer,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, brokenly. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I will, to ease your mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was with extreme reluctance that Grace cloaked herself next morning\r\nfor the undertaking. She was all the more indisposed to the journey by\r\nreason of Grammer\xe2\x80\x99s allusion to the effect of a pretty face upon Dr.\r\nFitzpiers; and hence she most illogically did that which, had the\r\ndoctor never seen her, would have operated to stultify the sole motive\r\nof her journey; that is to say, she put on a woollen veil, which hid\r\nall her face except an occasional spark of her eyes.\r\n\r\nHer own wish that nothing should be known of this strange and grewsome\r\nproceeding, no less than Grammer Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s own desire, led Grace to take\r\nevery precaution against being discovered. She went out by the garden\r\ndoor as the safest way, all the household having occupations at the\r\nother side. The morning looked forbidding enough when she stealthily\r\nopened it. The battle between frost and thaw was continuing in mid-air:\r\nthe trees dripped on the garden-plots, where no vegetables would grow\r\nfor the dripping, though they were planted year after year with that\r\ncurious mechanical regularity of country people in the face of\r\nhopelessness; the moss which covered the once broad gravel terrace was\r\nswamped; and Grace stood irresolute. Then she thought of poor Grammer,\r\nand her dreams of the doctor running after her, scalpel in hand, and\r\nthe possibility of a case so curiously similar to South\xe2\x80\x99s ending in the\r\nsame way; thereupon she stepped out into the drizzle.\r\n\r\nThe nature of her errand, and Grammer Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s account of the compact\r\nshe had made, lent a fascinating horror to Grace\xe2\x80\x99s conception of\r\nFitzpiers. She knew that he was a young man; but her single object in\r\nseeking an interview with him put all considerations of his age and\r\nsocial aspect from her mind. Standing as she stood, in Grammer Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshoes, he was simply a remorseless Jove of the sciences, who would not\r\nhave mercy, and would have sacrifice; a man whom, save for this, she\r\nwould have preferred to avoid knowing. But since, in such a small\r\nvillage, it was improbable that any long time could pass without their\r\nmeeting, there was not much to deplore in her having to meet him now.\r\n\r\nBut, as need hardly be said, Miss Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s view of the doctor as a\r\nmerciless, unwavering, irresistible scientist was not quite in\r\naccordance with fact. The real Dr. Fitzpiers was a man of too many\r\nhobbies to show likelihood of rising to any great eminence in the\r\nprofession he had chosen, or even to acquire any wide practice in the\r\nrural district he had marked out as his field of survey for the\r\npresent. In the course of a year his mind was accustomed to pass in a\r\ngrand solar sweep through all the zodiacal signs of the intellectual\r\nheaven. Sometimes it was in the Ram, sometimes in the Bull; one month\r\nhe would be immersed in alchemy, another in poesy; one month in the\r\nTwins of astrology and astronomy; then in the Crab of German literature\r\nand metaphysics. In justice to him it must be stated that he took such\r\nstudies as were immediately related to his own profession in turn with\r\nthe rest, and it had been in a month of anatomical ardor without the\r\npossibility of a subject that he had proposed to Grammer Oliver the\r\nterms she had mentioned to her mistress.\r\n\r\nAs may be inferred from the tone of his conversation with Winterborne,\r\nhe had lately plunged into abstract philosophy with much zest; perhaps\r\nhis keenly appreciative, modern, unpractical mind found this a realm\r\nmore to his taste than any other. Though his aims were desultory,\r\nFitzpiers\xe2\x80\x99s mental constitution was not without its admirable side; a\r\nkeen inquirer he honestly was, even if the midnight rays of his lamp,\r\nvisible so far through the trees of Hintock, lighted rank literatures\r\nof emotion and passion as often as, or oftener than, the books and\r\n_mat\xc3\xa9riel_ of science.\r\n\r\nBut whether he meditated the Muses or the philosophers, the loneliness\r\nof Hintock life was beginning to tell upon his impressionable nature.\r\nWinter in a solitary house in the country, without society, is\r\ntolerable, nay, even enjoyable and delightful, given certain\r\nconditions, but these are not the conditions which attach to the life\r\nof a professional man who drops down into such a place by mere\r\naccident. They were present to the lives of Winterborne, Melbury, and\r\nGrace; but not to the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s. They are old association\xe2\x80\x94an almost\r\nexhaustive biographical or historical acquaintance with every object,\r\nanimate and inanimate, within the observer\xe2\x80\x99s horizon. He must know all\r\nabout those invisible ones of the days gone by, whose feet have\r\ntraversed the fields which look so gray from his windows; recall whose\r\ncreaking plough has turned those sods from time to time; whose hands\r\nplanted the trees that form a crest to the opposite hill; whose horses\r\nand hounds have torn through that underwood; what birds affect that\r\nparticular brake; what domestic dramas of love, jealousy, revenge, or\r\ndisappointment have been enacted in the cottages, the mansion, the\r\nstreet, or on the green. The spot may have beauty, grandeur, salubrity,\r\nconvenience; but if it lack memories it will ultimately pall upon him\r\nwho settles there without opportunity of intercourse with his kind.\r\n\r\nIn such circumstances, maybe, an old man dreams of an ideal friend,\r\ntill he throws himself into the arms of any impostor who chooses to\r\nwear that title on his face. A young man may dream of an ideal friend\r\nlikewise, but some humor of the blood will probably lead him to think\r\nrather of an ideal mistress, and at length the rustle of a woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndress, the sound of her voice, or the transit of her form across the\r\nfield of his vision, will enkindle his soul with a flame that blinds\r\nhis eyes.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of the attractive Grace\xe2\x80\x99s name and family would have been\r\nenough in other circumstances to lead the doctor, if not to put her\r\npersonality out of his head, to change the character of his interest in\r\nher. Instead of treasuring her image as a rarity, he would at most have\r\nplayed with it as a toy. He was that kind of a man. But situated here\r\nhe could not go so far as amative cruelty. He dismissed all reverential\r\nthought about her, but he could not help taking her seriously.\r\n\r\nHe went on to imagine the impossible. So far, indeed, did he go in this\r\nfutile direction that, as others are wont to do, he constructed\r\ndialogues and scenes in which Grace had turned out to be the mistress\r\nof Hintock Manor-house, the mysterious Mrs. Charmond, particularly\r\nready and willing to be wooed by himself and nobody else. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, she\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t that,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, finally. \xe2\x80\x9cBut she\xe2\x80\x99s a very sweet, nice,\r\nexceptional girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe next morning he breakfasted alone, as usual. It was snowing with a\r\nfine-flaked desultoriness just sufficient to make the woodland gray,\r\nwithout ever achieving whiteness. There was not a single letter for\r\nFitzpiers, only a medical circular and a weekly newspaper.\r\n\r\nTo sit before a large fire on such mornings, and read, and gradually\r\nacquire energy till the evening came, and then, with lamp alight, and\r\nfeeling full of vigor, to pursue some engrossing subject or other till\r\nthe small hours, had hitherto been his practice. But to-day he could\r\nnot settle into his chair. That self-contained position he had lately\r\noccupied, in which the only attention demanded was the concentration of\r\nthe inner eye, all outer regard being quite gratuitous, seemed to have\r\nbeen taken by insidious stratagem, and for the first time he had an\r\ninterest outside the house. He walked from one window to another, and\r\nbecame aware that the most irksome of solitudes is not the solitude of\r\nremoteness, but that which is just outside desirable company.\r\n\r\nThe breakfast hour went by heavily enough, and the next followed, in\r\nthe same half-snowy, half-rainy style, the weather now being the\r\ninevitable relapse which sooner or later succeeds a time too radiant\r\nfor the season, such as they had enjoyed in the late midwinter at\r\nHintock. To people at home there these changeful tricks had their\r\ninterests; the strange mistakes that some of the more sanguine trees\r\nhad made in budding before their month, to be incontinently glued up by\r\nfrozen thawings now; the similar sanguine errors of impulsive birds in\r\nframing nests that were now swamped by snow-water, and other such\r\nincidents, prevented any sense of wearisomeness in the minds of the\r\nnatives. But these were features of a world not familiar to Fitzpiers,\r\nand the inner visions to which he had almost exclusively attended\r\nhaving suddenly failed in their power to absorb him, he felt\r\nunutterably dreary.\r\n\r\nHe wondered how long Miss Melbury was going to stay in Hintock. The\r\nseason was unpropitious for accidental encounters with her\r\nout-of-doors, and except by accident he saw not how they were to become\r\nacquainted. One thing was clear\xe2\x80\x94any acquaintance with her could only,\r\nwith a due regard to his future, be casual, at most of the nature of a\r\nflirtation; for he had high aims, and they would some day lead him into\r\nother spheres than this.\r\n\r\nThus desultorily thinking he flung himself down upon the couch, which,\r\nas in many draughty old country houses, was constructed with a hood,\r\nbeing in fact a legitimate development from the settle. He tried to\r\nread as he reclined, but having sat up till three o\xe2\x80\x99clock that morning,\r\nthe book slipped from his hand and he fell asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was at this time that Grace approached the house. Her knock, always\r\nsoft in virtue of her nature, was softer to-day by reason of her\r\nstrange errand. However, it was heard by the farmer\xe2\x80\x99s wife who kept the\r\nhouse, and Grace was admitted. Opening the door of the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s room\r\nthe housewife glanced in, and imagining Fitzpiers absent, asked Miss\r\nMelbury to enter and wait a few minutes while she should go and find\r\nhim, believing him to be somewhere on the premises. Grace acquiesced,\r\nwent in, and sat down close to the door.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the door was shut upon her she looked round the room, and\r\nstarted at perceiving a handsome man snugly ensconced in the couch,\r\nlike the recumbent figure within some canopied mural tomb of the\r\nfifteenth century, except that his hands were by no means clasped in\r\nprayer. She had no doubt that this was the doctor. Awaken him herself\r\nshe could not, and her immediate impulse was to go and pull the broad\r\nribbon with a brass rosette which hung at one side of the fireplace.\r\nBut expecting the landlady to re-enter in a moment she abandoned this\r\nintention, and stood gazing in great embarrassment at the reclining\r\nphilosopher.\r\n\r\nThe windows of Fitzpiers\xe2\x80\x99s soul being at present shuttered, he probably\r\nappeared less impressive than in his hours of animation; but the light\r\nabstracted from his material presence by sleep was more than\r\ncounterbalanced by the mysterious influence of that state, in a\r\nstranger, upon the consciousness of a beholder so sensitive. So far as\r\nshe could criticise at all, she became aware that she had encountered a\r\nspecimen of creation altogether unusual in that locality. The occasions\r\non which Grace had observed men of this stamp were when she had been\r\nfar removed away from Hintock, and even then such examples as had met\r\nher eye were at a distance, and mainly of coarser fibre than the one\r\nwho now confronted her.\r\n\r\nShe nervously wondered why the woman had not discovered her mistake and\r\nreturned, and went again towards the bell-pull. Approaching the chimney\r\nher back was to Fitzpiers, but she could see him in the glass. An\r\nindescribable thrill passed through her as she perceived that the eyes\r\nof the reflected image were open, gazing wonderingly at her, and under\r\nthe curious unexpectedness of the sight she became as if spellbound,\r\nalmost powerless to turn her head and regard the original. However, by\r\nan effort she did turn, when there he lay asleep the same as before.\r\n\r\nHer startled perplexity as to what he could be meaning was sufficient\r\nto lead her to precipitately abandon her errand. She crossed quickly to\r\nthe door, opened and closed it noiselessly, and went out of the house\r\nunobserved. By the time that she had gone down the path and through the\r\ngarden door into the lane she had recovered her equanimity. Here,\r\nscreened by the hedge, she stood and considered a while.\r\n\r\nDrip, drip, drip, fell the rain upon her umbrella and around; she had\r\ncome out on such a morning because of the seriousness of the matter in\r\nhand; yet now she had allowed her mission to be stultified by a\r\nmomentary tremulousness concerning an incident which perhaps had meant\r\nnothing after all.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time her departure from the room, stealthy as it had been,\r\nhad roused Fitzpiers, and he sat up. In the reflection from the mirror\r\nwhich Grace had beheld there was no mystery; he had opened his eyes for\r\na few moments, but had immediately relapsed into unconsciousness, if,\r\nindeed, he had ever been positively awake. That somebody had just left\r\nthe room he was certain, and that the lovely form which seemed to have\r\nvisited him in a dream was no less than the real presentation of the\r\nperson departed he could hardly doubt.\r\n\r\nLooking out of the window a few minutes later, down the box-edged\r\ngravel-path which led to the bottom, he saw the garden door gently\r\nopen, and through it enter the young girl of his thoughts, Grace having\r\njust at this juncture determined to return and attempt the interview a\r\nsecond time. That he saw her coming instead of going made him ask\r\nhimself if his first impression of her were not a dream indeed. She\r\ncame hesitatingly along, carrying her umbrella so low over her head\r\nthat he could hardly see her face. When she reached the point where the\r\nraspberry bushes ended and the strawberry bed began, she made a little\r\npause.\r\n\r\nFitzpiers feared that she might not be coming to him even now, and\r\nhastily quitting the room, he ran down the path to meet her. The nature\r\nof her errand he could not divine, but he was prepared to give her any\r\namount of encouragement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg pardon, Miss Melbury,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI saw you from the window, and\r\nfancied you might imagine that I was not at home\xe2\x80\x94if it is I you were\r\ncoming for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was coming to speak one word to you, nothing more,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I can say it here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no. Please do come in. Well, then, if you will not come into the\r\nhouse, come as far as the porch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus pressed she went on to the porch, and they stood together inside\r\nit, Fitzpiers closing her umbrella for her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have merely a request or petition to make,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cMy father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nservant is ill\xe2\x80\x94a woman you know\xe2\x80\x94and her illness is serious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry to hear it. You wish me to come and see her at once?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; I particularly wish you not to come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, indeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; and she wishes the same. It would make her seriously worse if you\r\nwere to come. It would almost kill her....My errand is of a peculiar\r\nand awkward nature. It is concerning a subject which weighs on her\r\nmind\xe2\x80\x94that unfortunate arrangement she made with you, that you might\r\nhave her body\xe2\x80\x94after death.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Grammer Oliver, the old woman with the fine head. Seriously ill,\r\nis she!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd _so_ disturbed by her rash compact! I have brought the money\r\nback\xe2\x80\x94will you please return to her the agreement she signed?\xe2\x80\x9d Grace\r\nheld out to him a couple of five-pound notes which she had kept ready\r\ntucked in her glove.\r\n\r\nWithout replying or considering the notes, Fitzpiers allowed his\r\nthoughts to follow his eyes, and dwell upon Grace\xe2\x80\x99s personality, and\r\nthe sudden close relation in which he stood to her. The porch was\r\nnarrow; the rain increased. It ran off the porch and dripped on the\r\ncreepers, and from the creepers upon the edge of Grace\xe2\x80\x99s cloak and\r\nskirts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe rain is wetting your dress; please do come in,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nreally makes my heart ache to let you stay here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nImmediately inside the front door was the door of his sitting-room; he\r\nflung it open, and stood in a coaxing attitude. Try how she would,\r\nGrace could not resist the supplicatory mandate written in the face and\r\nmanner of this man, and distressful resignation sat on her as she\r\nglided past him into the room\xe2\x80\x94brushing his coat with her elbow by\r\nreason of the narrowness.\r\n\r\nHe followed her, shut the door\xe2\x80\x94which she somehow had hoped he would\r\nleave open\xe2\x80\x94and placing a chair for her, sat down. The concern which\r\nGrace felt at the development of these commonplace incidents was, of\r\ncourse, mainly owing to the strange effect upon her nerves of that view\r\nof him in the mirror gazing at her with open eyes when she had thought\r\nhim sleeping, which made her fancy that his slumber might have been a\r\nfeint based on inexplicable reasons.\r\n\r\nShe again proffered the notes; he awoke from looking at her as at a\r\npiece of live statuary, and listened deferentially as she said, \xe2\x80\x9cWill\r\nyou then reconsider, and cancel the bond which poor Grammer Oliver so\r\nfoolishly gave?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll cancel it without reconsideration. Though you will allow me to\r\nhave my own opinion about her foolishness. Grammer is a very wise\r\nwoman, and she was as wise in that as in other things. You think there\r\nwas something very fiendish in the compact, do you not, Miss Melbury?\r\nBut remember that the most eminent of our surgeons in past times have\r\nentered into such agreements.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot fiendish\xe2\x80\x94strange.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that may be, since strangeness is not in the nature of a thing,\r\nbut in its relation to something extrinsic\xe2\x80\x94in this case an unessential\r\nobserver.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went to his desk, and searching a while found a paper, which be\r\nunfolded and brought to her. A thick cross appeared in ink at the\r\nbottom\xe2\x80\x94evidently from the hand of Grammer. Grace put the paper in her\r\npocket with a look of much relief.\r\n\r\nAs Fitzpiers did not take up the money (half of which had come from\r\nGrace\xe2\x80\x99s own purse), she pushed it a little nearer to him. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, no. I\r\nshall not take it from the old woman,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is more strange\r\nthan the fact of a surgeon arranging to obtain a subject for dissection\r\nthat our acquaintance should be formed out of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid you think me uncivil in showing my dislike to the notion.\r\nBut I did not mean to be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, no.\xe2\x80\x9d He looked at her, as he had done before, with puzzled\r\ninterest. \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot think, I cannot think,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured. \xe2\x80\x9cSomething\r\nbewilders me greatly.\xe2\x80\x9d He still reflected and hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cLast night I\r\nsat up very late,\xe2\x80\x9d he at last went on, \xe2\x80\x9cand on that account I fell into\r\na little nap on that couch about half an hour ago. And during my few\r\nminutes of unconsciousness I dreamed\xe2\x80\x94what do you think?\xe2\x80\x94that you stood\r\nin the room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShould she tell? She merely blushed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may imagine,\xe2\x80\x9d Fitzpiers continued, now persuaded that it had,\r\nindeed, been a dream, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I should not have dreamed of you without\r\nconsiderable thinking about you first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe could not be acting; of that she felt assured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fancied in my vision that you stood there,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, pointing to\r\nwhere she had paused. \xe2\x80\x9cI did not see you directly, but reflected in the\r\nglass. I thought, what a lovely creature! The design is for once\r\ncarried out. Nature has at last recovered her lost union with the Idea!\r\nMy thoughts ran in that direction because I had been reading the work\r\nof a transcendental philosopher last night; and I dare say it was the\r\ndose of Idealism that I received from it that made me scarcely able to\r\ndistinguish between reality and fancy. I almost wept when I awoke, and\r\nfound that you had appeared to me in Time, but not in Space, alas!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt moments there was something theatrical in the delivery of\r\nFitzpiers\xe2\x80\x99s effusion; yet it would have been inexact to say that it was\r\nintrinsically theatrical. It often happens that in situations of\r\nunrestraint, where there is no thought of the eye of criticism, real\r\nfeeling glides into a mode of manifestation not easily distinguishable\r\nfrom rodomontade. A veneer of affectation overlies a bulk of truth,\r\nwith the evil consequence, if perceived, that the substance is\r\nestimated by the superficies, and the whole rejected.\r\n\r\nGrace, however, was no specialist in men\xe2\x80\x99s manners, and she admired the\r\nsentiment without thinking of the form. And she was embarrassed:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9clovely creature\xe2\x80\x9d made explanation awkward to her gentle modesty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut can it be,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, suddenly, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you really were here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have to confess that I have been in the room once before,\xe2\x80\x9d faltered\r\nshe. \xe2\x80\x9cThe woman showed me in, and went away to fetch you; but as she\r\ndid not return, I left.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you saw me asleep,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured, with the faintest show of\r\nhumiliation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94_if_ you were asleep, and did not deceive me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you say if?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw your eyes open in the glass, but as they were closed when I\r\nlooked round upon you, I thought you were perhaps deceiving me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fitzpiers, fervently\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cnever could I deceive you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nForeknowledge to the distance of a year or so in either of them might\r\nhave spoiled the effect of that pretty speech. Never deceive her! But\r\nthey knew nothing, and the phrase had its day.\r\n\r\nGrace began now to be anxious to terminate the interview, but the\r\ncompelling power of Fitzpiers\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere still held her there. She\r\nwas like an inexperienced actress who, having at last taken up her\r\nposition on the boards, and spoken her speeches, does not know how to\r\nmove off. The thought of Grammer occurred to her. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go at once and\r\ntell poor Grammer of your generosity,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will relieve her\r\nat once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGrammer\xe2\x80\x99s a nervous disease, too\xe2\x80\x94how singular!\xe2\x80\x9d he answered,\r\naccompanying her to the door. \xe2\x80\x9cOne moment; look at this\xe2\x80\x94it is something\r\nwhich may interest you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had thrown open the door on the other side of the passage, and she\r\nsaw a microscope on the table of the confronting room. \xe2\x80\x9cLook into it,\r\nplease; you\xe2\x80\x99ll be interested,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated.\r\n\r\nShe applied her eye, and saw the usual circle of light patterned all\r\nover with a cellular tissue of some indescribable sort. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you\r\nthink that is?\xe2\x80\x9d said Fitzpiers.\r\n\r\nShe did not know.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a fragment of old John South\xe2\x80\x99s brain, which I am\r\ninvestigating.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe started back, not with aversion, but with wonder as to how it\r\nshould have got there. Fitzpiers laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere am I,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cendeavoring to carry on simultaneously the study\r\nof physiology and transcendental philosophy, the material world and the\r\nideal, so as to discover if possible a point of contrast between them;\r\nand your finer sense is quite offended!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, Mr. Fitzpiers,\xe2\x80\x9d said Grace, earnestly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not so at all. I\r\nknow from seeing your light at night how deeply you meditate and work.\r\nInstead of condemning you for your studies, I admire you very much!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer face, upturned from the microscope, was so sweet, sincere, and\r\nself-forgetful in its aspect that the susceptible Fitzpiers more than\r\nwished to annihilate the lineal yard which separated it from his own.\r\nWhether anything of the kind showed in his eyes or not, Grace remained\r\nno longer at the microscope, but quickly went her way into the rain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstead of resuming his investigation of South\xe2\x80\x99s brain, which perhaps\r\nwas not so interesting under the microscope as might have been expected\r\nfrom the importance of that organ in life, Fitzpiers reclined and\r\nruminated on the interview. Grace\xe2\x80\x99s curious susceptibility to his\r\npresence, though it was as if the currents of her life were disturbed\r\nrather than attracted by him, added a special interest to her general\r\ncharm. Fitzpiers was in a distinct degree scientific, being ready and\r\nzealous to interrogate all physical manifestations, but primarily he\r\nwas an idealist. He believed that behind the imperfect lay the perfect;\r\nthat rare things were to be discovered amid a bulk of commonplace; that\r\nresults in a new and untried case might be different from those in\r\nother cases where the conditions had been precisely similar. Regarding\r\nhis own personality as one of unbounded possibilities, because it was\r\nhis own\xe2\x80\x94notwithstanding that the factors of his life had worked out a\r\nsorry product for thousands\xe2\x80\x94he saw nothing but what was regular in his\r\ndiscovery at Hintock of an altogether exceptional being of the other\r\nsex, who for nobody else would have had any existence.\r\n\r\nOne habit of Fitzpiers\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94commoner in dreamers of more advanced age than\r\nin men of his years\xe2\x80\x94was that of talking to himself. He paced round his\r\nroom with a selective tread upon the more prominent blooms of the\r\ncarpet, and murmured, \xe2\x80\x9cThis phenomenal girl will be the light of my\r\nlife while I am at Hintock; and the special beauty of the situation is\r\nthat our attitude and relations to each other will be purely spiritual.\r\nSocially we can never be intimate. Anything like matrimonial intentions\r\ntowards her, charming as she is, would be absurd. They would spoil the\r\nethereal character of my regard. And, indeed, I have other aims on the\r\npractical side of my life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFitzpiers bestowed a regulation thought on the advantageous marriage he\r\nwas bound to make with a woman of family as good as his own, and of\r\npurse much longer. But as an object of contemplation for the present,\r\nas objective spirit rather than corporeal presence, Grace Melbury would\r\nserve to keep his soul alive, and to relieve the monotony of his days.\r\n\r\nHis first notion\xe2\x80\x94acquired from the mere sight of her without\r\nconverse\xe2\x80\x94that of an idle and vulgar flirtation with a timber-merchant\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npretty daughter, grated painfully upon him now that he had found what\r\nGrace intrinsically was. Personal intercourse with such as she could\r\ntake no lower form than intellectual communion, and mutual explorations\r\nof the world of thought. Since he could not call at her father\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nhaving no practical views, cursory encounters in the lane, in the wood,\r\ncoming and going to and from church, or in passing her dwelling, were\r\nwhat the acquaintance would have to feed on.\r\n\r\nSuch anticipated glimpses of her now and then realized themselves in\r\nthe event. Rencounters of not more than a minute\xe2\x80\x99s duration, frequently\r\nrepeated, will build up mutual interest, even an intimacy, in a lonely\r\nplace. Theirs grew as imperceptibly as the tree-twigs budded. There\r\nnever was a particular moment at which it could be said they became\r\nfriends; yet a delicate understanding now existed between two who in\r\nthe winter had been strangers.\r\n\r\nSpring weather came on rather suddenly, the unsealing of buds that had\r\nlong been swollen accomplishing itself in the space of one warm night.\r\nThe rush of sap in the veins of the trees could almost be heard. The\r\nflowers of late April took up a position unseen, and looked as if they\r\nhad been blooming a long while, though there had been no trace of them\r\nthe day before yesterday; birds began not to mind getting wet. In-door\r\npeople said they had heard the nightingale, to which out-door people\r\nreplied contemptuously that they had heard him a fortnight before.\r\n\r\nThe young doctor\xe2\x80\x99s practice being scarcely so large as a London\r\nsurgeon\xe2\x80\x99s, he frequently walked in the wood. Indeed such practice as he\r\nhad he did not follow up with the assiduity that would have been\r\nnecessary for developing it to exceptional proportions. One day, book\r\nin hand, he walked in a part of the wood where the trees were mainly\r\noaks. It was a calm afternoon, and there was everywhere around that\r\nsign of great undertakings on the part of vegetable nature which is apt\r\nto fill reflective human beings who are not undertaking much themselves\r\nwith a sudden uneasiness at the contrast. He heard in the distance a\r\ncurious sound, something like the quack of a duck, which, though it was\r\ncommon enough here about this time, was not common to him.\r\n\r\nLooking through the trees Fitzpiers soon perceived the origin of the\r\nnoise. The barking season had just commenced, and what he had heard was\r\nthe tear of the ripping tool as it ploughed its way along the sticky\r\nparting between the trunk and the rind. Melbury did a large business in\r\nbark, and as he was Grace\xe2\x80\x99s father, and possibly might be found on the\r\nspot, Fitzpiers was attracted to the scene even more than he might have\r\nbeen by its intrinsic interest. When he got nearer he recognized among\r\nthe workmen the two Timothys, and Robert Creedle, who probably had been\r\n\xe2\x80\x9clent\xe2\x80\x9d by Winterborne; Marty South also assisted.\r\n\r\nEach tree doomed to this flaying process was first attacked by Creedle.\r\nWith a small billhook he carefully freed the collar of the tree from\r\ntwigs and patches of moss which incrusted it to a height of a foot or\r\ntwo above the ground, an operation comparable to the \xe2\x80\x9clittle toilet\xe2\x80\x9d of\r\nthe executioner\xe2\x80\x99s victim. After this it was barked in its erect\r\nposition to a point as high as a man could reach. If a fine product of\r\nvegetable nature could ever be said to look ridiculous it was the case\r\nnow, when the oak stood naked-legged, and as if ashamed, till the\r\naxe-man came and cut a ring round it, and the two Timothys finished the\r\nwork with the crosscut-saw.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it had fallen the barkers attacked it like locusts, and in a\r\nshort time not a particle of rind was left on the trunk and larger\r\nlimbs. Marty South was an adept at peeling the upper parts, and there\r\nshe stood encaged amid the mass of twigs and buds like a great bird,\r\nrunning her tool into the smallest branches, beyond the farthest points\r\nto which the skill and patience of the men enabled them to\r\nproceed\xe2\x80\x94branches which, in their lifetime, had swayed high above the\r\nbulk of the wood, and caught the latest and earliest rays of the sun\r\nand moon while the lower part of the forest was still in darkness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou seem to have a better instrument than they, Marty,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nFitzpiers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, holding up the tool\xe2\x80\x94a horse\xe2\x80\x99s leg-bone fitted into\r\na handle and filed to an edge\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99tis only that they\xe2\x80\x99ve less patience\r\nwith the twigs, because their time is worth more than mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA little shed had been constructed on the spot, of thatched hurdles and\r\nboughs, and in front of it was a fire, over which a kettle sung.\r\nFitzpiers sat down inside the shelter, and went on with his reading,\r\nexcept when he looked up to observe the scene and the actors. The\r\nthought that he might settle here and become welded in with this sylvan\r\nlife by marrying Grace Melbury crossed his mind for a moment. Why\r\nshould he go farther into the world than where he was? The secret of\r\nquiet happiness lay in limiting the ideas and aspirations; these men\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthoughts were conterminous with the margin of the Hintock woodlands,\r\nand why should not his be likewise limited\xe2\x80\x94a small practice among the\r\npeople around him being the bound of his desires?\r\n\r\nPresently Marty South discontinued her operations upon the quivering\r\nboughs, came out from the reclining oak, and prepared tea. When it was\r\nready the men were called; and Fitzpiers being in a mood to join, sat\r\ndown with them.\r\n\r\nThe latent reason of his lingering here so long revealed itself when\r\nthe faint creaking of the joints of a vehicle became audible, and one\r\nof the men said, \xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s he.\xe2\x80\x9d Turning their heads they saw Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngig approaching, the wheels muffled by the yielding moss.\r\n\r\nThe timber-merchant was on foot leading the horse, looking back at\r\nevery few steps to caution his daughter, who kept her seat, where and\r\nhow to duck her head so as to avoid the overhanging branches. They\r\nstopped at the spot where the bark-ripping had been temporarily\r\nsuspended; Melbury cursorily examined the heaps of bark, and drawing\r\nnear to where the workmen were sitting down, accepted their shouted\r\ninvitation to have a dish of tea, for which purpose he hitched the\r\nhorse to a bough. Grace declined to take any of their beverage, and\r\nremained in her place in the vehicle, looking dreamily at the sunlight\r\nthat came in thin threads through the hollies with which the oaks were\r\ninterspersed.\r\n\r\nWhen Melbury stepped up close to the shelter, he for the first time\r\nperceived that the doctor was present, and warmly appreciated\r\nFitzpiers\xe2\x80\x99s invitation to sit down on the log beside him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBless my heart, who would have thought of finding you here,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\nobviously much pleased at the circumstance. \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder now if my\r\ndaughter knows you are so nigh at hand. I don\xe2\x80\x99t expect she do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked out towards the gig wherein Grace sat, her face still turned\r\nin the opposite direction. \xe2\x80\x9cShe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t see us. Well, never mind: let\r\nher be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrace was indeed quite unconscious of Fitzpiers\xe2\x80\x99s propinquity. She was\r\nthinking of something which had little connection with the scene before\r\nher\xe2\x80\x94thinking of her friend, lost as soon as found, Mrs. Charmond; of\r\nher capricious conduct, and of the contrasting scenes she was possibly\r\nenjoying at that very moment in other climes, to which Grace herself\r\nhad hoped to be introduced by her friend\xe2\x80\x99s means. She wondered if this\r\npatronizing lady would return to Hintock during the summer, and whether\r\nthe acquaintance which had been nipped on the last occasion of her\r\nresidence there would develop on the next.\r\n\r\nMelbury told ancient timber-stories as he sat, relating them directly\r\nto Fitzpiers, and obliquely to the men, who had heard them often\r\nbefore. Marty, who poured out tea, was just saying, \xe2\x80\x9cI think I\xe2\x80\x99ll take\r\nout a cup to Miss Grace,\xe2\x80\x9d when they heard a clashing of the\r\ngig-harness, and turning round Melbury saw that the horse had become\r\nrestless, and was jerking about the vehicle in a way which alarmed its\r\noccupant, though she refrained from screaming. Melbury jumped up\r\nimmediately, but not more quickly than Fitzpiers; and while her father\r\nran to the horse\xe2\x80\x99s head and speedily began to control him, Fitzpiers\r\nwas alongside the gig assisting Grace to descend. Her surprise at his\r\nappearance was so great that, far from making a calm and independent\r\ndescent, she was very nearly lifted down in his arms. He relinquished\r\nher when she touched ground, and hoped she was not frightened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, not much,\xe2\x80\x9d she managed to say. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was no danger\xe2\x80\x94unless he\r\nhad run under the trees where the boughs are low enough to hit my\r\nhead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich was by no means an impossibility, and justifies any amount of\r\nalarm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe referred to what he thought he saw written in her face, and she\r\ncould not tell him that this had little to do with the horse, but much\r\nwith himself. His contiguity had, in fact, the same effect upon her as\r\non those former occasions when he had come closer to her than\r\nusual\xe2\x80\x94that of producing in her an unaccountable tendency to\r\ntearfulness. Melbury soon put the horse to rights, and seeing that\r\nGrace was safe, turned again to the work-people. His daughter\xe2\x80\x99s nervous\r\ndistress had passed off in a few moments, and she said quite gayly to\r\nFitzpiers as she walked with him towards the group, \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s destiny in\r\nit, you see. I was doomed to join in your picnic, although I did not\r\nintend to do so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarty prepared her a comfortable place, and she sat down in the circle,\r\nand listened to Fitzpiers while he drew from her father and the\r\nbark-rippers sundry narratives of their fathers\xe2\x80\x99, their grandfathers\xe2\x80\x99,\r\nand their own adventures in these woods; of the mysterious sights they\r\nhad seen\xe2\x80\x94only to be accounted for by supernatural agency; of white\r\nwitches and black witches; and the standard story of the spirits of the\r\ntwo brothers who had fought and fallen, and had haunted Hintock House\r\ntill they were exorcised by the priest, and compelled to retreat to a\r\nswamp in this very wood, whence they were returning to their old\r\nquarters at the rate of a cock\xe2\x80\x99s stride every New-year\xe2\x80\x99s Day, old\r\nstyle; hence the local saying, \xe2\x80\x9cOn New-year\xe2\x80\x99s tide, a cock\xe2\x80\x99s stride.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a pleasant time. The smoke from the little fire of peeled sticks\r\nrose between the sitters and the sunlight, and behind its blue veil\r\nstretched the naked arms of the prostrate trees. The smell of the\r\nuncovered sap mingled with the smell of the burning wood, and the\r\nsticky inner surface of the scattered bark glistened as it revealed its\r\npale madder hues to the eye. Melbury was so highly satisfied at having\r\nFitzpiers as a sort of guest that he would have sat on for any length\r\nof time, but Grace, on whom Fitzpiers\xe2\x80\x99s eyes only too frequently\r\nalighted, seemed to think it incumbent upon her to make a show of\r\ngoing; and her father thereupon accompanied her to the vehicle.\r\n\r\nAs the doctor had helped her out of it he appeared to think that he had\r\nexcellent reasons for helping her in, and performed the attention\r\nlingeringly enough.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat were you almost in tears about just now?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, softly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d she said: and the words were strictly true.\r\n\r\nMelbury mounted on the other side, and they drove on out of the grove,\r\ntheir wheels silently crushing delicate-patterned mosses, hyacinths,\r\nprimroses, lords-and-ladies, and other strange and ordinary plants, and\r\ncracking up little sticks that lay across the track. Their way homeward\r\nran along the crest of a lofty hill, whence on the right they beheld a\r\nwide valley, differing both in feature and atmosphere from that of the\r\nHintock precincts. It was the cider country, which met the woodland\r\ndistrict on the axis of this hill. Over the vale the air was blue as\r\nsapphire\xe2\x80\x94such a blue as outside that apple-valley was never seen. Under\r\nthe blue the orchards were in a blaze of bloom, some of the richly\r\nflowered trees running almost up to where they drove along. Over a gate\r\nwhich opened down the incline a man leaned on his arms, regarding this\r\nfair promise so intently that he did not observe their passing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was Giles,\xe2\x80\x9d said Melbury, when they had gone by.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas it? Poor Giles,\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll that blooth means heavy autumn work for him and his hands. If no\r\nblight happens before the setting the apple yield will be such as we\r\nhave not had for years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in the wood they had come from, the men had sat on so long\r\nthat they were indisposed to begin work again that evening; they were\r\npaid by the ton, and their time for labor was as they chose. They\r\nplaced the last gatherings of bark in rows for the curers, which led\r\nthem farther and farther away from the shed; and thus they gradually\r\nwithdrew as the sun went down.\r\n\r\nFitzpiers lingered yet. He had opened his book again, though he could\r\nhardly see a word in it, and sat before the dying fire, scarcely\r\nknowing of the men\xe2\x80\x99s departure. He dreamed and mused till his\r\nconsciousness seemed to occupy the whole space of the woodland around,\r\nso little was there of jarring sight or sound to hinder perfect unity\r\nwith the sentiment of the place. The idea returned upon him of\r\nsacrificing all practical aims to live in calm contentment here, and\r\ninstead of going on elaborating new conceptions with infinite pains, to\r\naccept quiet domesticity according to oldest and homeliest notions.\r\nThese reflections detained him till the wood was embrowned with the\r\ncoming night, and the shy little bird of this dusky time had begun to\r\npour out all the intensity of his eloquence from a bush not very far\r\noff.\r\n\r\nFitzpiers\xe2\x80\x99s eyes commanded as much of the ground in front as was open.\r\nEntering upon this he saw a figure, whose direction of movement was\r\ntowards the spot where he sat. The surgeon was quite shrouded from\r\nobservation by the recessed shadow of the hut, and there was no reason\r\nwhy he should move till the stranger had passed by. The shape resolved\r\nitself into a woman\xe2\x80\x99s; she was looking on the ground, and walking\r\nslowly as if searching for something that had been lost, her course\r\nbeing precisely that of Mr. Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s gig. Fitzpiers by a sort of\r\ndivination jumped to the idea that the figure was Grace\xe2\x80\x99s; her nearer\r\napproach made the guess a certainty.\r\n\r\nYes, she was looking for something; and she came round by the prostrate\r\ntrees that would have been invisible but for the white nakedness which\r\nenabled her to avoid them easily. Thus she approached the heap of\r\nashes, and acting upon what was suggested by a still shining ember or\r\ntwo, she took a stick and stirred the heap, which thereupon burst into\r\na flame. On looking around by the light thus obtained she for the first\r\ntime saw the illumined face of Fitzpiers, precisely in the spot where\r\nshe had left him.\r\n\r\nGrace gave a start and a scream: the place had been associated with him\r\nin her thoughts, but she had not expected to find him there still.\r\nFitzpiers lost not a moment in rising and going to her side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI frightened you dreadfully, I know,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI ought to have\r\nspoken; but I did not at first expect it to be you. I have been sitting\r\nhere ever since.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was actually supporting her with his arm, as though under the\r\nimpression that she was quite overcome, and in danger of falling. As\r\nsoon as she could collect her ideas she gently withdrew from his grasp,\r\nand explained what she had returned for: in getting up or down from the\r\ngig, or when sitting by the hut fire, she had dropped her purse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow we will find it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fitzpiers.\r\n\r\nHe threw an armful of last year\xe2\x80\x99s leaves on to the fire, which made the\r\nflame leap higher, and the encompassing shades to weave themselves into\r\na denser contrast, turning eve into night in a moment. By this radiance\r\nthey groped about on their hands and knees, till Fitzpiers rested on\r\nhis elbow, and looked at Grace. \xe2\x80\x9cWe must always meet in odd\r\ncircumstances,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cand this is one of the oddest. I wonder if it\r\nmeans anything?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, I am sure it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Grace in haste, quickly assuming an\r\nerect posture. \xe2\x80\x9cPray don\xe2\x80\x99t say it any more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope there was not much money in the purse,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fitzpiers, rising\r\nto his feet more slowly, and brushing the leaves from his trousers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cScarcely any. I cared most about the purse itself, because it was\r\ngiven me. Indeed, money is of little more use at Hintock than on\r\nCrusoe\xe2\x80\x99s island; there\xe2\x80\x99s hardly any way of spending it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey had given up the search when Fitzpiers discerned something by his\r\nfoot. \xe2\x80\x9cHere it is,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cso that your father, mother, friend, or\r\n_admirer_ will not have his or her feelings hurt by a sense of your\r\nnegligence after all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, he knows nothing of what I do now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe admirer?\xe2\x80\x9d said Fitzpiers, slyly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you would call him that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Grace, with simplicity.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe admirer is a superficial, conditional creature, and this person is\r\nquite different.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has all the cardinal virtues.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps\xe2\x80\x94though I don\xe2\x80\x99t know them precisely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou unconsciously practise them, Miss Melbury, which is better.\r\nAccording to Schleiermacher they are Self-control, Perseverance,\r\nWisdom, and Love; and his is the best list that I know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid poor\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d She was going to say that she feared\r\nWinterborne\xe2\x80\x94the giver of the purse years before\xe2\x80\x94had not much\r\nperseverance, though he had all the other three; but she determined to\r\ngo no further in this direction, and was silent.\r\n\r\nThese half-revelations made a perceptible difference in Fitzpiers. His\r\nsense of personal superiority wasted away, and Grace assumed in his\r\neyes the true aspect of a mistress in her lover\xe2\x80\x99s regard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Melbury,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, suddenly, \xe2\x80\x9cI divine that this virtuous man you\r\nmention has been refused by you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe could do no otherwise than admit it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not inquire without good reason. God forbid that I should kneel\r\nin another\xe2\x80\x99s place at any shrine unfairly. But, my dear Miss Melbury,\r\nnow that he is gone, may I draw near?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t say anything about that!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, quickly. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause when\r\na man has been refused you feel pity for him, and like him more than\r\nyou did before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis increasing complication added still more value to Grace in the\r\nsurgeon\xe2\x80\x99s eyes: it rendered her adorable. \xe2\x80\x9cBut cannot you say?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\npleaded, distractedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d rather not\xe2\x80\x94I think I must go home at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fitzpiers. But as he did not move she felt it awkward to\r\nwalk straight away from him; and so they stood silently together. A\r\ndiversion was created by the accident of two birds, that had either\r\nbeen roosting above their heads or nesting there, tumbling one over the\r\nother into the hot ashes at their feet, apparently engrossed in a\r\ndesperate quarrel that prevented the use of their wings. They speedily\r\nparted, however, and flew up, and were seen no more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the end of what is called love!\xe2\x80\x9d said some one.\r\n\r\nThe speaker was neither Grace nor Fitzpiers, but Marty South, who\r\napproached with her face turned up to the sky in her endeavor to trace\r\nthe birds. Suddenly perceiving Grace, she exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Miss Melbury!\r\nI have been following they pigeons, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t see you. And here\xe2\x80\x99s Mr.\r\nWinterborne!\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, shyly, as she looked towards Fitzpiers,\r\nwho stood in the background.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarty,\xe2\x80\x9d Grace interrupted. \xe2\x80\x9cI want you to walk home with me\xe2\x80\x94will you?\r\nCome along.\xe2\x80\x9d And without lingering longer she took hold of Marty\xe2\x80\x99s arm\r\nand led her away.\r\n\r\nThey went between the spectral arms of the peeled trees as they lay,\r\nand onward among the growing trees, by a path where there were no oaks,\r\nand no barking, and no Fitzpiers\xe2\x80\x94nothing but copse-wood, between which\r\nthe primroses could be discerned in pale bunches. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know Mr.\r\nWinterborne was there,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marty, breaking the silence when they had\r\nnearly reached Grace\xe2\x80\x99s door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor was he,\xe2\x80\x9d said Grace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Miss Melbury, I saw him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Grace. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was somebody else. Giles Winterborne is nothing\r\nto me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe leaves over Hintock grew denser in their substance, and the\r\nwoodland seemed to change from an open filigree to a solid opaque body\r\nof infinitely larger shape and importance. The boughs cast green\r\nshades, which hurt the complexion of the girls who walked there; and a\r\nfringe of them which overhung Mr. Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s garden dripped on his\r\nseed-plots when it rained, pitting their surface all over as with\r\npock-marks, till Melbury declared that gardens in such a place were no\r\ngood at all. The two trees that had creaked all the winter left off\r\ncreaking, the whir of the night-jar, however, forming a very\r\nsatisfactory continuation of uncanny music from that quarter. Except at\r\nmid-day the sun was not seen complete by the Hintock people, but rather\r\nin the form of numerous little stars staring through the leaves.\r\n\r\nSuch an appearance it had on Midsummer Eve of this year, and as the\r\nhour grew later, and nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock drew on, the irradiation of the\r\ndaytime became broken up by weird shadows and ghostly nooks of\r\nindistinctness. Imagination could trace upon the trunks and boughs\r\nstrange faces and figures shaped by the dying lights; the surfaces of\r\nthe holly-leaves would here and there shine like peeping eyes, while\r\nsuch fragments of the sky as were visible between the trunks assumed\r\nthe aspect of sheeted forms and cloven tongues. This was before the\r\nmoonrise. Later on, when that planet was getting command of the upper\r\nheaven, and consequently shining with an unbroken face into such open\r\nglades as there were in the neighborhood of the hamlet, it became\r\napparent that the margin of the wood which approached the\r\ntimber-merchant\xe2\x80\x99s premises was not to be left to the customary\r\nstillness of that reposeful time.\r\n\r\nFitzpiers having heard a voice or voices, was looking over his garden\r\ngate\xe2\x80\x94where he now looked more frequently than into his books\xe2\x80\x94fancying\r\nthat Grace might be abroad with some friends. He was now irretrievably\r\ncommitted in heart to Grace Melbury, though he was by no means sure\r\nthat she was so far committed to him. That the Idea had for once\r\ncompletely fulfilled itself in the objective substance\xe2\x80\x94which he had\r\nhitherto deemed an impossibility\xe2\x80\x94he was enchanted enough to fancy must\r\nbe the case at last. It was not Grace who had passed, however, but\r\nseveral of the ordinary village girls in a group\xe2\x80\x94some steadily walking,\r\nsome in a mood of wild gayety. He quietly asked his landlady, who was\r\nalso in the garden, what these girls were intending, and she informed\r\nhim that it being Old Midsummer Eve, they were about to attempt some\r\nspell or enchantment which would afford them a glimpse of their future\r\npartners for life. She declared it to be an ungodly performance, and\r\none which she for her part would never countenance; saying which, she\r\nentered her house and retired to bed.\r\n\r\nThe young man lit a cigar and followed the bevy of maidens slowly up\r\nthe road. They had turned into the wood at an opening between Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nand Marty South\xe2\x80\x99s; but Fitzpiers could easily track them by their\r\nvoices, low as they endeavored to keep their tones.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time other inhabitants of Little Hintock had become aware\r\nof the nocturnal experiment about to be tried, and were also sauntering\r\nstealthily after the frisky maidens. Miss Melbury had been informed by\r\nMarty South during the day of the proposed peep into futurity, and,\r\nbeing only a girl like the rest, she was sufficiently interested to\r\nwish to see the issue. The moon was so bright and the night so calm\r\nthat she had no difficulty in persuading Mrs. Melbury to accompany her;\r\nand thus, joined by Marty, these went onward in the same direction.\r\n\r\nPassing Winterborne\xe2\x80\x99s house, they heard a noise of hammering. Marty\r\nexplained it. This was the last night on which his paternal roof would\r\nshelter him, the days of grace since it fell into hand having expired;\r\nand Giles was taking down his cupboards and bedsteads with a view to an\r\nearly exit next morning. His encounter with Mrs. Charmond had cost him\r\ndearly.\r\n\r\nWhen they had proceeded a little farther Marty was joined by Grammer\r\nOliver (who was as young as the youngest in such matters), and Grace\r\nand Mrs. Melbury went on by themselves till they had arrived at the\r\nspot chosen by the village daughters, whose primary intention of\r\nkeeping their expedition a secret had been quite defeated. Grace and\r\nher step-mother paused by a holly-tree; and at a little distance stood\r\nFitzpiers under the shade of a young oak, intently observing Grace, who\r\nwas in the full rays of the moon.\r\n\r\nHe watched her without speaking, and unperceived by any but Marty and\r\nGrammer, who had drawn up on the dark side of the same holly which\r\nsheltered Mrs. and Miss Melbury on its bright side. The two former\r\nconversed in low tones.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf they two come up in Wood next Midsummer Night they\xe2\x80\x99ll come as one,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Grammer, signifying Fitzpiers and Grace. \xe2\x80\x9cInstead of my\r\nskellington he\xe2\x80\x99ll carry home her living carcass before long. But though\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s a lady in herself, and worthy of any such as he, it do seem to me\r\nthat he ought to marry somebody more of the sort of Mrs. Charmond, and\r\nthat Miss Grace should make the best of Winterborne.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarty returned no comment; and at that minute the girls, some of whom\r\nwere from Great Hintock, were seen advancing to work the incantation,\r\nit being now about midnight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDirectly we see anything we\xe2\x80\x99ll run home as fast as we can,\xe2\x80\x9d said one,\r\nwhose courage had begun to fail her. To this the rest assented, not\r\nknowing that a dozen neighbors lurked in the bushes around.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish we had not thought of trying this,\xe2\x80\x9d said another, \xe2\x80\x9cbut had\r\ncontented ourselves with the hole-digging to-morrow at twelve, and\r\nhearing our husbands\xe2\x80\x99 trades. It is too much like having dealings with\r\nthe Evil One to try to raise their forms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHowever, they had gone too far to recede, and slowly began to march\r\nforward in a skirmishing line through the trees towards the deeper\r\nrecesses of the wood. As far as the listeners could gather, the\r\nparticular form of black-art to be practised on this occasion was one\r\nconnected with the sowing of hemp-seed, a handful of which was carried\r\nby each girl. At the moment of their advance they looked back, and\r\ndiscerned the figure of Miss Melbury, who, alone of all the observers,\r\nstood in the full face of the moonlight, deeply engrossed in the\r\nproceedings. By contrast with her life of late years they made her feel\r\nas if she had receded a couple of centuries in the world\xe2\x80\x99s history. She\r\nwas rendered doubly conspicuous by her light dress, and after a few\r\nwhispered words, one of the girls\xe2\x80\x94a bouncing maiden, plighted to young\r\nTimothy Tangs\xe2\x80\x94asked her if she would join in. Grace, with some\r\nexcitement, said that she would, and moved on a little in the rear of\r\nthe rest.\r\n\r\nSoon the listeners could hear nothing of their proceedings beyond the\r\nfaintest occasional rustle of leaves. Grammer whispered again to Marty:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t ye go and try your luck with the rest of the maids?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marty, shortly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, half the parish is here\xe2\x80\x94the silly hussies should have kept it\r\nquiet. I see Mr. Winterborne through the leaves, just come up with\r\nRobert Creedle. Marty, we ought to act the part o\xe2\x80\x99 Providence\r\nsometimes. Do go and tell him that if he stands just behind the bush at\r\nthe bottom of the slope, Miss Grace must pass down it when she comes\r\nback, and she will most likely rush into his arms; for as soon as the\r\nclock strikes, they\xe2\x80\x99ll bundle back home\xe2\x80\x94along like hares. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen\r\nsuch larries before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think I\xe2\x80\x99d better?\xe2\x80\x9d said Marty, reluctantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, he\xe2\x80\x99ll bless ye for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want that kind of blessing.\xe2\x80\x9d But after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s thought she\r\nwent and delivered the information; and Grammer had the satisfaction of\r\nseeing Giles walk slowly to the bend in the leafy defile along which\r\nGrace would have to return.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Mrs. Melbury, deserted by Grace, had perceived Fitzpiers and\r\nWinterborne, and also the move of the latter. An improvement on\r\nGrammer\xe2\x80\x99s idea entered the mind of Mrs. Melbury, for she had lately\r\ndiscerned what her husband had not\xe2\x80\x94that Grace was rapidly fascinating\r\nthe surgeon. She therefore drew near to Fitzpiers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou should be where Mr. Winterborne is standing,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to him,\r\nsignificantly. \xe2\x80\x9cShe will run down through that opening much faster than\r\nshe went up it, if she is like the rest of the girls.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFitzpiers did not require to be told twice. He went across to\r\nWinterborne and stood beside him. Each knew the probable purpose of the\r\nother in standing there, and neither spoke, Fitzpiers scorning to look\r\nupon Winterborne as a rival, and Winterborne adhering to the off-hand\r\nmanner of indifference which had grown upon him since his dismissal.\r\n\r\nNeither Grammer nor Marty South had seen the surgeon\xe2\x80\x99s manoeuvre, and,\r\nstill to help Winterborne, as she supposed, the old woman suggested to\r\nthe wood-girl that she should walk forward at the heels of Grace, and\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ctole\xe2\x80\x9d her down the required way if she showed a tendency to run in\r\nanother direction. Poor Marty, always doomed to sacrifice desire to\r\nobligation, walked forward accordingly, and waited as a beacon, still\r\nand silent, for the retreat of Grace and her giddy companions, now\r\nquite out of hearing.\r\n\r\nThe first sound to break the silence was the distant note of Great\r\nHintock clock striking the significant hour. About a minute later that\r\nquarter of the wood to which the girls had wandered resounded with the\r\nflapping of disturbed birds; then two or three hares and rabbits\r\nbounded down the glade from the same direction, and after these the\r\nrustling and crackling of leaves and dead twigs denoted the hurried\r\napproach of the adventurers, whose fluttering gowns soon became\r\nvisible. Miss Melbury, having gone forward quite in the rear of the\r\nrest, was one of the first to return, and the excitement being\r\ncontagious, she ran laughing towards Marty, who still stood as a\r\nhand-post to guide her; then, passing on, she flew round the fatal bush\r\nwhere the undergrowth narrowed to a gorge. Marty arrived at her heels\r\njust in time to see the result. Fitzpiers had quickly stepped forward\r\nin front of Winterborne, who, disdaining to shift his position, had\r\nturned on his heel, and then the surgeon did what he would not have\r\nthought of doing but for Mrs. Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s encouragement and the sentiment\r\nof an eve which effaced conventionality. Stretching out his arms as the\r\nwhite figure burst upon him, he captured her in a moment, as if she had\r\nbeen a bird.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Grace, in her fright.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are in my arms, dearest,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fitzpiers, \xe2\x80\x9cand I am going to claim\r\nyou, and keep you there all our two lives!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe rested on him like one utterly mastered, and it was several seconds\r\nbefore she recovered from this helplessness. Subdued screams and\r\nstruggles, audible from neighboring brakes, revealed that there had\r\nbeen other lurkers thereabout for a similar purpose. Grace, unlike most\r\nof these companions of hers, instead of gasping and writhing, said in a\r\ntrembling voice, \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Fitzpiers, will you let me go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, laughing; \xe2\x80\x9cas soon as you have recovered.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe waited another few moments, then quietly and firmly pushed him\r\naside, and glided on her path, the moon whitening her hot blush away.\r\nBut it had been enough\xe2\x80\x94new relations between them had begun.\r\n\r\nThe case of the other girls was different, as has been said. They\r\nwrestled and tittered, only escaping after a desperate struggle.\r\nFitzpiers could hear these enactments still going on after Grace had\r\nleft him, and he remained on the spot where he had caught her,\r\nWinterborne having gone away. On a sudden another girl came bounding\r\ndown the same descent that had been followed by Grace\xe2\x80\x94a fine-framed\r\nyoung woman with naked arms. Seeing Fitzpiers standing there, she said,\r\nwith playful effrontery, \xe2\x80\x9cMay\xe2\x80\x99st kiss me if \xe2\x80\x98canst catch me, Tim!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFitzpiers recognized her as Suke Damson, a hoydenish damsel of the\r\nhamlet, who was plainly mistaking him for her lover. He was impulsively\r\ndisposed to profit by her error, and as soon as she began racing away\r\nhe started in pursuit.\r\n\r\nOn she went under the boughs, now in light, now in shade, looking over\r\nher shoulder at him every few moments and kissing her hand; but so\r\ncunningly dodging about among the trees and moon-shades that she never\r\nallowed him to get dangerously near her. Thus they ran and doubled,\r\nFitzpiers warming with the chase, till the sound of their companions\r\nhad quite died away. He began to lose hope of ever overtaking her, when\r\nall at once, by way of encouragement, she turned to a fence in which\r\nthere was a stile and leaped over it. Outside the scene was a changed\r\none\xe2\x80\x94a meadow, where the half-made hay lay about in heaps, in the\r\nuninterrupted shine of the now high moon.\r\n\r\nFitzpiers saw in a moment that, having taken to open ground, she had\r\nplaced herself at his mercy, and he promptly vaulted over after her.\r\nShe flitted a little way down the mead, when all at once her light form\r\ndisappeared as if it had sunk into the earth. She had buried herself in\r\none of the hay-cocks.\r\n\r\nFitzpiers, now thoroughly excited, was not going to let her escape him\r\nthus. He approached, and set about turning over the heaps one by one.\r\nAs soon as he paused, tantalized and puzzled, he was directed anew by\r\nan imitative kiss which came from her hiding-place, and by snatches of\r\na local ballad in the smallest voice she could assume:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO come in from the foggy, foggy dew.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a minute or two he uncovered her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, \xe2\x80\x99tis not Tim!\xe2\x80\x9d said she, burying her face.\r\n\r\nFitzpiers, however, disregarded her resistance by reason of its\r\nmildness, stooped and imprinted the purposed kiss, then sunk down on\r\nthe next hay-cock, panting with his race.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhom do you mean by Tim?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, presently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy young man, Tim Tangs,\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, honor bright, did you really think it was he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did at first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you didn\xe2\x80\x99t at last?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t at last.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you much mind that it was not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, slyly.\r\n\r\nFitzpiers did not pursue his questioning. In the moonlight Suke looked\r\nvery beautiful, the scratches and blemishes incidental to her out-door\r\noccupation being invisible under these pale rays. While they remain\r\nsilent the coarse whir of the eternal night-jar burst sarcastically\r\nfrom the top of a tree at the nearest corner of the wood. Besides this\r\nnot a sound of any kind reached their ears, the time of nightingales\r\nbeing now past, and Hintock lying at a distance of two miles at least.\r\nIn the opposite direction the hay-field stretched away into remoteness\r\ntill it was lost to the eye in a soft mist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the general stampede occurred Winterborne had also been looking\r\non, and encountering one of the girls, had asked her what caused them\r\nall to fly.\r\n\r\nShe said with solemn breathlessness that they had seen something very\r\ndifferent from what they had hoped to see, and that she for one would\r\nnever attempt such unholy ceremonies again. \xe2\x80\x9cWe saw Satan pursuing us\r\nwith his hour-glass. It was terrible!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis account being a little incoherent, Giles went forward towards the\r\nspot from which the girls had retreated. After listening there a few\r\nminutes he heard slow footsteps rustling over the leaves, and looking\r\nthrough a tangled screen of honeysuckle which hung from a bough, he saw\r\nin the open space beyond a short stout man in evening-dress, carrying\r\non one arm a light overcoat and also his hat, so awkwardly arranged as\r\npossibly to have suggested the \xe2\x80\x9chour-glass\xe2\x80\x9d to his timid observers\xe2\x80\x94if\r\nthis were the person whom the girls had seen. With the other hand he\r\nsilently gesticulated and the moonlight falling upon his bare brow\r\nshowed him to have dark hair and a high forehead of the shape seen\r\noftener in old prints and paintings than in real life. His curious and\r\naltogether alien aspect, his strange gestures, like those of one who is\r\nrehearsing a scene to himself, and the unusual place and hour, were\r\nsufficient to account for any trepidation among the Hintock daughters\r\nat encountering him.\r\n\r\nHe paused, and looked round, as if he had forgotten where he was; not\r\nobserving Giles, who was of the color of his environment. The latter\r\nadvanced into the light. The gentleman held up his hand and came\r\ntowards Giles, the two meeting half-way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have lost my way,\xe2\x80\x9d said the stranger. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you can put me in the\r\npath again.\xe2\x80\x9d He wiped his forehead with the air of one suffering under\r\nan agitation more than that of simple fatigue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe turnpike-road is over there,\xe2\x80\x9d said Giles\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want the turnpike-road,\xe2\x80\x9d said the gentleman, impatiently. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ncame from that. I want Hintock House. Is there not a path to it across\r\nhere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, yes, a sort of path. But it is hard to find from this point.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll show you the way, sir, with great pleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks, my good friend. The truth is that I decided to walk across the\r\ncountry after dinner from the hotel at Sherton, where I am staying for\r\na day or two. But I did not know it was so far.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is about a mile to the house from here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey walked on together. As there was no path, Giles occasionally\r\nstepped in front and bent aside the underboughs of the trees to give\r\nhis companion a passage, saying every now and then when the twigs, on\r\nbeing released, flew back like whips, \xe2\x80\x9cMind your eyes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d To which\r\nthe stranger replied, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d in a preoccupied tone.\r\n\r\nSo they went on, the leaf-shadows running in their usual quick\r\nsuccession over the forms of the pedestrians, till the stranger said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it far?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot much farther,\xe2\x80\x9d said Winterborne. \xe2\x80\x9cThe plantation runs up into a\r\ncorner here, close behind the house.\xe2\x80\x9d He added with hesitation, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nknow, I suppose, sir, that Mrs. Charmond is not at home?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mistake,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other, quickly. \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Charmond has been away\r\nfor some time, but she\xe2\x80\x99s at home now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGiles did not contradict him, though he felt sure that the gentleman\r\nwas wrong.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a native of this place?\xe2\x80\x9d the stranger said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you are happy in having a home. It is what I don\xe2\x80\x99t possess.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou come from far, seemingly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI come now from the south of Europe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, indeed, sir. You are an Italian, or Spanish, or French gentleman,\r\nperhaps?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not either.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGiles did not fill the pause which ensued, and the gentleman, who\r\nseemed of an emotional nature, unable to resist friendship, at length\r\nanswered the question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am an Italianized American, a South Carolinian by birth,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI left my native country on the failure of the Southern cause, and\r\nhave never returned to it since.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe spoke no more about himself, and they came to the verge of the wood.\r\nHere, striding over the fence out upon the upland sward, they could at\r\nonce see the chimneys of the house in the gorge immediately beneath\r\ntheir position, silent, still, and pale.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you tell me the time?\xe2\x80\x9d the gentleman asked. \xe2\x80\x9cMy watch has\r\nstopped.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is between twelve and one,\xe2\x80\x9d said Giles.\r\n\r\nHis companion expressed his astonishment. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought it between nine\r\nand ten at latest! Dear me\xe2\x80\x94dear me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe now begged Giles to return, and offered him a gold coin, which\r\nlooked like a sovereign, for the assistance rendered. Giles declined to\r\naccept anything, to the surprise of the stranger, who, on putting the\r\nmoney back into his pocket, said, awkwardly, \xe2\x80\x9cI offered it because I\r\nwant you to utter no word about this meeting with me. Will you\r\npromise?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWinterborne promised readily. He thereupon stood still while the other\r\nascended the slope. At the bottom he looked back dubiously. Giles would\r\nno longer remain when he was so evidently desired to leave, and\r\nreturned through the boughs to Hintock.\r\n\r\nHe suspected that this man, who seemed so distressed and melancholy,\r\nmight be that lover and persistent wooer of Mrs. Charmond whom he had\r\nheard so frequently spoken of, and whom it was said she had treated\r\ncavalierly. But he received no confirmation of his suspicion beyond a\r\nreport which reached him a few days later that a gentleman had called\r\nup the servants who were taking care of Hintock House at an hour past\r\nmidnight; and on learning that Mrs. Charmond, though returned from\r\nabroad, was as yet in London, he had sworn bitterly, and gone away\r\nwithout leaving a card or any trace of himself.\r\n\r\nThe girls who related the story added that he sighed three times before\r\nhe swore, but this part of the narrative was not corroborated. Anyhow,\r\nsuch a gentleman had driven away from the hotel at Sherton next day in\r\na carriage hired at that inn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sunny, leafy week which followed the tender doings of Midsummer Eve\r\nbrought a visitor to Fitzpiers\xe2\x80\x99s door; a voice that he knew sounded in\r\nthe passage. Mr. Melbury had called. At first he had a particular\r\nobjection to enter the parlor, because his boots were dusty, but as the\r\nsurgeon insisted he waived the point and came in.\r\n\r\nLooking neither to the right nor to the left, hardly at Fitzpiers\r\nhimself, he put his hat under his chair, and with a preoccupied gaze at\r\nthe floor, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve called to ask you, doctor, quite privately, a\r\nquestion that troubles me. I\xe2\x80\x99ve a daughter, Grace, an only daughter, as\r\nyou may have heard. Well, she\xe2\x80\x99s been out in the dew\xe2\x80\x94on Midsummer Eve in\r\nparticular she went out in thin slippers to watch some vagary of the\r\nHintock maids\xe2\x80\x94and she\xe2\x80\x99s got a cough, a distinct hemming and hacking,\r\nthat makes me uneasy. Now, I have decided to send her away to some\r\nseaside place for a change\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSend her away!\xe2\x80\x9d Fitzpiers\xe2\x80\x99s countenance had fallen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. And the question is, where would you advise me to send her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe timber-merchant had happened to call at a moment when Fitzpiers was\r\nat the spring-tide of a sentiment that Grace was a necessity of his\r\nexistence. The sudden pressure of her form upon his breast as she came\r\nheadlong round the bush had never ceased to linger with him, ever since\r\nhe adopted the manoeuvre for which the hour and the moonlight and the\r\noccasion had been the only excuse. Now she was to be sent away.\r\nAmbition? it could be postponed. Family? culture and reciprocity of\r\ntastes had taken the place of family nowadays. He allowed himself to be\r\ncarried forward on the wave of his desire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow strange, how very strange it is,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you should have\r\ncome to me about her just now. I have been thinking every day of coming\r\nto you on the very same errand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x94you have noticed, too, that her health\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have noticed nothing the matter with her health, because there is\r\nnothing. But, Mr. Melbury, I have seen your daughter several times by\r\naccident. I have admired her infinitely, and I was coming to ask you if\r\nI may become better acquainted with her\xe2\x80\x94pay my addresses to her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMelbury was looking down as he listened, and did not see the air of\r\nhalf-misgiving at his own rashness that spread over Fitzpiers\xe2\x80\x99s face as\r\nhe made this declaration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have\xe2\x80\x94got to know her?\xe2\x80\x9d said Melbury, a spell of dead silence\r\nhaving preceded his utterance, during which his emotion rose with\r\nalmost visible effect.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fitzpiers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you wish to become better acquainted with her? You mean with a\r\nview to marriage\xe2\x80\x94of course that is what you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man. \xe2\x80\x9cI mean, get acquainted with her, with a\r\nview to being her accepted lover; and if we suited each other, what\r\nwould naturally follow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe timber-merchant was much surprised, and fairly agitated; his hand\r\ntrembled as he laid by his walking-stick. \xe2\x80\x9cThis takes me unawares,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid he, his voice wellnigh breaking down. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mean that there is\r\nanything unexpected in a gentleman being attracted by her; but it did\r\nnot occur to me that it would be you. I always said,\xe2\x80\x9d continued he,\r\nwith a lump in his throat, \xe2\x80\x9cthat my Grace would make a mark at her own\r\nlevel some day. That was why I educated her. I said to myself, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll do\r\nit, cost what it may;\xe2\x80\x99 though her mother-law was pretty frightened at\r\nmy paying out so much money year after year. I knew it would tell in\r\nthe end. \xe2\x80\x98Where you\xe2\x80\x99ve not good material to work on, such doings would\r\nbe waste and vanity,\xe2\x80\x99 I said. \xe2\x80\x98But where you have that material it is\r\nsure to be worth while.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad you don\xe2\x80\x99t object,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fitzpiers, almost wishing that Grace\r\nhad not been quite so cheap for him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf she is willing I don\xe2\x80\x99t object, certainly. Indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d added the honest\r\nman, \xe2\x80\x9cit would be deceit if I were to pretend to feel anything else\r\nthan highly honored personally; and it is a great credit to her to have\r\ndrawn to her a man of such good professional station and venerable old\r\nfamily. That huntsman-fellow little thought how wrong he was about her!\r\nTake her and welcome, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll endeavor to ascertain her mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes. But she will be agreeable, I should think. She ought to be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope she may. Well, now you\xe2\x80\x99ll expect to see me frequently.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes. But, name it all\xe2\x80\x94about her cough, and her going away. I had\r\nquite forgot that that was what I came about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI assure you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the surgeon, \xe2\x80\x9cthat her cough can only be the\r\nresult of a slight cold, and it is not necessary to banish her to any\r\nseaside place at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMelbury looked unconvinced, doubting whether he ought to take\r\nFitzpiers\xe2\x80\x99s professional opinion in circumstances which naturally led\r\nhim to wish to keep her there. The doctor saw this, and honestly\r\ndreading to lose sight of her, he said, eagerly, \xe2\x80\x9cBetween ourselves, if\r\nI am successful with her I will take her away myself for a month or\r\ntwo, as soon as we are married, which I hope will be before the chilly\r\nweather comes on. This will be so very much better than letting her go\r\nnow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe proposal pleased Melbury much. There could be hardly any danger in\r\npostponing any desirable change of air as long as the warm weather\r\nlasted, and for such a reason. Suddenly recollecting himself, he said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour time must be precious, doctor. I\xe2\x80\x99ll get home-along. I am much\r\nobliged to ye. As you will see her often, you\xe2\x80\x99ll discover for yourself\r\nif anything serious is the matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can assure you it is nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fitzpiers, who had seen Grace\r\nmuch oftener already than her father knew of.\r\n\r\nWhen he was gone Fitzpiers paused, silent, registering his sensations,\r\nlike a man who has made a plunge for a pearl into a medium of which he\r\nknows not the density or temperature. But he had done it, and Grace was\r\nthe sweetest girl alive.\r\n\r\nAs for the departed visitor, his own last words lingered in Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nears as he walked homeward; he felt that what he had said in the\r\nemotion of the moment was very stupid, ungenteel, and unsuited to a\r\ndialogue with an educated gentleman, the smallness of whose practice\r\nwas more than compensated by the former greatness of his family. He had\r\nuttered thoughts before they were weighed, and almost before they were\r\nshaped. They had expressed in a certain sense his feeling at\r\nFitzpiers\xe2\x80\x99s news, but yet they were not right. Looking on the ground,\r\nand planting his stick at each tread as if it were a flag-staff, he\r\nreached his own precincts, where, as he passed through the court, he\r\nautomatically stopped to look at the men working in the shed and\r\naround. One of them asked him a question about wagon-spokes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHey?\xe2\x80\x9d said Melbury, looking hard at him. The man repeated the words.\r\n\r\nMelbury stood; then turning suddenly away without answering, he went up\r\nthe court and entered the house. As time was no object with the\r\njourneymen, except as a thing to get past, they leisurely surveyed the\r\ndoor through which he had disappeared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat maggot has the gaffer got in his head now?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tangs the elder.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSommit to do with that chiel of his! When you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a maid of yer\r\nown, John Upjohn, that costs ye what she costs him, that will take the\r\nsqueak out of your Sunday shoes, John! But you\xe2\x80\x99ll never be tall enough\r\nto accomplish such as she; and \xe2\x80\x99tis a lucky thing for ye, John, as\r\nthings be. Well, he ought to have a dozen\xe2\x80\x94that would bring him to\r\nreason. I see \xe2\x80\x99em walking together last Sunday, and when they came to a\r\npuddle he lifted her over like a halfpenny doll. He ought to have a\r\ndozen; he\xe2\x80\x99d let \xe2\x80\x99em walk through puddles for themselves then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Melbury had entered the house with the look of a man who sees\r\na vision before him. His wife was in the room. Without taking off his\r\nhat he sat down at random.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLuce\xe2\x80\x94we\xe2\x80\x99ve done it!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94the thing is as I expected. The\r\nspell, that I foresaw might be worked, has worked. She\xe2\x80\x99s done it, and\r\ndone it well. Where is she\xe2\x80\x94Grace, I mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUp in her room\xe2\x80\x94what has happened!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Melbury explained the circumstances as coherently as he could. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ntold you so,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cA maid like her couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stay hid long, even in\r\na place like this. But where is Grace? Let\xe2\x80\x99s have her down.\r\nHere\xe2\x80\x94Gra-a-ace!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe appeared after a reasonable interval, for she was sufficiently\r\nspoiled by this father of hers not to put herself in a hurry, however\r\nimpatient his tones. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it, father?\xe2\x80\x9d said she, with a smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you scamp, what\xe2\x80\x99s this you\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing? Not home here more than\r\nsix months, yet, instead of confining yourself to your father\xe2\x80\x99s rank,\r\nmaking havoc in the educated classes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThough accustomed to show herself instantly appreciative of her\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s meanings, Grace was fairly unable to look anyhow but at a loss\r\nnow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no\xe2\x80\x94of course you don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I mean, or you pretend you don\xe2\x80\x99t;\r\nthough, for my part, I believe women can see these things through a\r\ndouble hedge. But I suppose I must tell ye. Why, you\xe2\x80\x99ve flung your\r\ngrapnel over the doctor, and he\xe2\x80\x99s coming courting forthwith.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly think of that, my dear! Don\xe2\x80\x99t you feel it a triumph?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs.\r\nMelbury.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cComing courting! I\xe2\x80\x99ve done nothing to make him,\xe2\x80\x9d Grace exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Twasn\xe2\x80\x99t necessary that you should, \xe2\x80\x99Tis voluntary that rules in these\r\nthings....Well, he has behaved very honorably, and asked my consent.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99ll know what to do when he gets here, I dare say. I needn\xe2\x80\x99t tell\r\nyou to make it all smooth for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean, to lead him on to marry me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do. Haven\xe2\x80\x99t I educated you for it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrace looked out of the window and at the fireplace with no animation\r\nin her face. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy is it settled off-hand in this way?\xe2\x80\x9d said she,\r\ncoquettishly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll wait till you hear what I think of him, I\r\nsuppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, of course. But you see what a good thing it will be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe weighed the statement without speaking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will be restored to the society you\xe2\x80\x99ve been taken away from,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncontinued her father; \xe2\x80\x9cfor I don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose he\xe2\x80\x99ll stay here long.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe admitted the advantage; but it was plain that though Fitzpiers\r\nexercised a certain fascination over her when he was present, or even\r\nmore, an almost psychic influence, and though his impulsive act in the\r\nwood had stirred her feelings indescribably, she had never regarded him\r\nin the light of a destined husband. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to answer,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cI have learned that he is very clever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s all right, and he\xe2\x80\x99s coming here to see you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA premonition that she could not resist him if he came strangely moved\r\nher. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course, father, you remember that it is only lately that\r\nGiles\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know that you can\xe2\x80\x99t think of him. He has given up all claim to\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe could not explain the subtleties of her feeling as he could state\r\nhis opinion, even though she had skill in speech, and her father had\r\nnone. That Fitzpiers acted upon her like a dram, exciting her, throwing\r\nher into a novel atmosphere which biassed her doings until the\r\ninfluence was over, when she felt something of the nature of regret for\r\nthe mood she had experienced\xe2\x80\x94still more if she reflected on the silent,\r\nalmost sarcastic, criticism apparent in Winterborne\xe2\x80\x99s air towards\r\nher\xe2\x80\x94could not be told to this worthy couple in words.\r\n\r\nIt so happened that on this very day Fitzpiers was called away from\r\nHintock by an engagement to attend some medical meetings, and his\r\nvisits, therefore, did not begin at once. A note, however, arrived from\r\nhim addressed to Grace, deploring his enforced absence. As a material\r\nobject this note was pretty and superfine, a note of a sort that she\r\nhad been unaccustomed to see since her return to Hintock, except when a\r\nschool friend wrote to her\xe2\x80\x94a rare instance, for the girls were\r\nrespecters of persons, and many cooled down towards the timber-dealer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndaughter when she was out of sight. Thus the receipt of it pleased her,\r\nand she afterwards walked about with a reflective air.\r\n\r\nIn the evening her father, who knew that the note had come, said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy\r\nbe ye not sitting down to answer your letter? That\xe2\x80\x99s what young folks\r\ndid in my time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe replied that it did not require an answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you know best,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. Nevertheless, he went about his business\r\ndoubting if she were right in not replying; possibly she might be so\r\nmismanaging matters as to risk the loss of an alliance which would\r\nbring her much happiness.\r\n\r\nMelbury\xe2\x80\x99s respect for Fitzpiers was based less on his professional\r\nposition, which was not much, than on the standing of his family in the\r\ncounty in by-gone days. That implicit faith in members of\r\nlong-established families, as such, irrespective of their personal\r\ncondition or character, which is still found among old-fashioned people\r\nin the rural districts reached its full intensity in Melbury. His\r\ndaughter\xe2\x80\x99s suitor was descended from a family he had heard of in his\r\ngrandfather\xe2\x80\x99s time as being once great, a family which had conferred\r\nits name upon a neighboring village; how, then, could anything be amiss\r\nin this betrothal?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must keep her up to this,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to his wife. \xe2\x80\x9cShe sees it is for\r\nher happiness; but still she\xe2\x80\x99s young, and may want a little prompting\r\nfrom an older tongue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith this in view he took her out for a walk, a custom of his when he\r\nwished to say anything specially impressive. Their way was over the top\r\nof that lofty ridge dividing their woodland from the cider district,\r\nwhence they had in the spring beheld the miles of apple-trees in bloom.\r\nAll was now deep green. The spot recalled to Grace\xe2\x80\x99s mind the last\r\noccasion of her presence there, and she said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe promise of an\r\nenormous apple-crop is fulfilling itself, is it not? I suppose Giles is\r\ngetting his mills and presses ready.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was just what her father had not come there to talk about. Without\r\nreplying he raised his arm, and moved his finger till he fixed it at a\r\npoint. \xe2\x80\x9cThere,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou see that plantation reaching over the\r\nhill like a great slug, and just behind the hill a particularly green\r\nsheltered bottom? That\xe2\x80\x99s where Mr. Fitzpiers\xe2\x80\x99s family were lords of the\r\nmanor for I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how many hundred years, and there stands the\r\nvillage of Buckbury Fitzpiers. A wonderful property \xe2\x80\x99twas\xe2\x80\x94wonderful!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut they are not lords of the manor there now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, no. But good and great things die as well as little and foolish.\r\nThe only ones representing the family now, I believe, are our doctor\r\nand a maiden lady living I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where. You can\xe2\x80\x99t help being\r\nhappy, Grace, in allying yourself with such a romantical family. You\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nfeel as if you\xe2\x80\x99ve stepped into history.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve been at Hintock as long as they\xe2\x80\x99ve been at Buckbury; is it not\r\nso? You say our name occurs in old deeds continually.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes\xe2\x80\x94as yeomen, copyholders, and such like. But think how much\r\nbetter this will be for \xe2\x80\x99ee. You\xe2\x80\x99ll be living a high intellectual life,\r\nsuch as has now become natural to you; and though the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s practice\r\nis small here, he\xe2\x80\x99ll no doubt go to a dashing town when he\xe2\x80\x99s got his\r\nhand in, and keep a stylish carriage, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll be brought to know a\r\ngood many ladies of excellent society. If you should ever meet me then,\r\nGrace, you can drive past me, looking the other way. I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t expect\r\nyou to speak to me, or wish such a thing, unless it happened to be in\r\nsome lonely, private place where \xe2\x80\x99twouldn\xe2\x80\x99t lower ye at all. Don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink such men as neighbor Giles your equal. He and I shall be good\r\nfriends enough, but he\xe2\x80\x99s not for the like of you. He\xe2\x80\x99s lived our rough\r\nand homely life here, and his wife\xe2\x80\x99s life must be rough and homely\r\nlikewise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo much pressure could not but produce some displacement. As Grace was\r\nleft very much to herself, she took advantage of one fine day before\r\nFitzpiers\xe2\x80\x99s return to drive into the aforesaid vale where stood the\r\nvillage of Buckbury Fitzpiers. Leaving her father\xe2\x80\x99s man at the inn with\r\nthe horse and gig, she rambled onward to the ruins of a castle, which\r\nstood in a field hard by. She had no doubt that it represented the\r\nancient stronghold of the Fitzpiers family.\r\n\r\nThe remains were few, and consisted mostly of remnants of the lower\r\nvaulting, supported on low stout columns surmounted by the _crochet_\r\ncapital of the period. The two or three arches of these vaults that\r\nwere still in position were utilized by the adjoining farmer as shelter\r\nfor his calves, the floor being spread with straw, amid which the young\r\ncreatures rustled, cooling their thirsty tongues by licking the quaint\r\nNorman carving, which glistened with the moisture. It was a degradation\r\nof even such a rude form of art as this to be treatad so grossly, she\r\nthought, and for the first time the family of Fitzpiers assumed in her\r\nimagination the hues of a melancholy romanticism.\r\n\r\nIt was soon time to drive home, and she traversed the distance with a\r\npreoccupied mind. The idea of so modern a man in science and aesthetics\r\nas the young surgeon springing out of relics so ancient was a kind of\r\nnovelty she had never before experienced. The combination lent him a\r\nsocial and intellectual interest which she dreaded, so much weight did\r\nit add to the strange influence he exercised upon her whenever he came\r\nnear her.\r\n\r\nIn an excitement which was not love, not ambition, rather a fearful\r\nconsciousness of hazard in the air, she awaited his return.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile her father was awaiting him also. In his house there was an\r\nold work on medicine, published towards the end of the last century,\r\nand to put himself in harmony with events Melbury spread this work on\r\nhis knees when he had done his day\xe2\x80\x99s business, and read about Galen,\r\nHippocrates, and Herophilus\xe2\x80\x94of the dogmatic, the empiric, the\r\nhermetical, and other sects of practitioners that have arisen in\r\nhistory; and thence proceeded to the classification of maladies and the\r\nrules for their treatment, as laid down in this valuable book with\r\nabsolute precision. Melbury regretted that the treatise was so old,\r\nfearing that he might in consequence be unable to hold as complete a\r\nconversation as he could wish with Mr. Fitzpiers, primed, no doubt,\r\nwith more recent discoveries.\r\n\r\nThe day of Fitzpiers\xe2\x80\x99s return arrived, and he sent to say that he would\r\ncall immediately. In the little time that was afforded for putting the\r\nhouse in order the sweeping of Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s parlor was as the sweeping of\r\nthe parlor at the Interpreter\xe2\x80\x99s which wellnigh choked the Pilgrim. At\r\nthe end of it Mrs. Melbury sat down, folded her hands and lips, and\r\nwaited. Her husband restlessly walked in and out from the timber-yard,\r\nstared at the interior of the room, jerked out \xe2\x80\x9cay, ay,\xe2\x80\x9d and retreated\r\nagain. Between four and five Fitzpiers arrived, hitching his horse to\r\nthe hook outside the door.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he had walked in and perceived that Grace was not in the\r\nroom, he seemed to have a misgiving. Nothing less than her actual\r\npresence could long keep him to the level of this impassioned\r\nenterprise, and that lacking he appeared as one who wished to retrace\r\nhis steps.\r\n\r\nHe mechanically talked at what he considered a woodland matron\xe2\x80\x99s level\r\nof thought till a rustling was heard on the stairs, and Grace came in.\r\nFitzpiers was for once as agitated as she. Over and above the genuine\r\nemotion which she raised in his heart there hung the sense that he was\r\ncasting a die by impulse which he might not have thrown by judgment.\r\n\r\nMr. Melbury was not in the room. Having to attend to matters in the\r\nyard, he had delayed putting on his afternoon coat and waistcoat till\r\nthe doctor\xe2\x80\x99s appearance, when, not wishing to be backward in receiving\r\nhim, he entered the parlor hastily buttoning up those garments. Grace\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfastidiousness was a little distressed that Fitzpiers should see by\r\nthis action the strain his visit was putting upon her father; and to\r\nmake matters worse for her just then, old Grammer seemed to have a\r\npassion for incessantly pumping in the back kitchen, leaving the doors\r\nopen so that the banging and splashing were distinct above the parlor\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\nWhenever the chat over the tea sank into pleasant desultoriness Mr.\r\nMelbury broke in with speeches of labored precision on very remote\r\ntopics, as if he feared to let Fitzpiers\xe2\x80\x99s mind dwell critically on the\r\nsubject nearest the hearts of all. In truth a constrained manner was\r\nnatural enough in Melbury just now, for the greatest interest of his\r\nlife was reaching its crisis. Could the real have been beheld instead\r\nof the corporeal merely, the corner of the room in which he sat would\r\nhave been filled with a form typical of anxious suspense, large-eyed,\r\ntight-lipped, awaiting the issue. That paternal hopes and fears so\r\nintense should be bound up in the person of one child so peculiarly\r\ncircumstanced, and not have dispersed themselves over the larger field\r\nof a whole family, involved dangerous risks to future happiness.\r\n\r\nFitzpiers did not stay more than an hour, but that time had apparently\r\nadvanced his sentiments towards Grace, once and for all, from a vaguely\r\nliquescent to an organic shape. She would not have accompanied him to\r\nthe door in response to his whispered \xe2\x80\x9cCome!\xe2\x80\x9d if her mother had not\r\nsaid in a matter-of-fact way, \xe2\x80\x9cOf course, Grace; go to the door with\r\nMr. Fitzpiers.\xe2\x80\x9d Accordingly Grace went, both her parents remaining in\r\nthe room. When the young pair were in the great brick-floored hall the\r\nlover took the girl\xe2\x80\x99s hand in his, drew it under his arm, and thus led\r\nher on to the door, where he stealthily kissed her.\r\n\r\nShe broke from him trembling, blushed and turned aside, hardly knowing\r\nhow things had advanced to this. Fitzpiers drove off, kissing his hand\r\nto her, and waving it to Melbury who was visible through the window.\r\nHer father returned the surgeon\xe2\x80\x99s action with a great flourish of his\r\nown hand and a satisfied smile.\r\n\r\nThe intoxication that Fitzpiers had, as usual, produced in Grace\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbrain during the visit passed off somewhat with his withdrawal. She\r\nfelt like a woman who did not know what she had been doing for the\r\nprevious hour, but supposed with trepidation that the afternoon\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nproceedings, though vague, had amounted to an engagement between\r\nherself and the handsome, coercive, irresistible Fitzpiers.\r\n\r\nThis visit was a type of many which followed it during the long summer\r\ndays of that year. Grace was borne along upon a stream of reasonings,\r\narguments, and persuasions, supplemented, it must be added, by\r\ninclinations of her own at times. No woman is without aspirations,\r\nwhich may be innocent enough within certain limits; and Grace had been\r\nso trained socially, and educated intellectually, as to see clearly\r\nenough a pleasure in the position of wife to such a man as Fitzpiers.\r\nHis material standing of itself, either present or future, had little\r\nin it to give her ambition, but the possibilities of a refined and\r\ncultivated inner life, of subtle psychological intercourse, had their\r\ncharm. It was this rather than any vulgar idea of marrying well which\r\ncaused her to float with the current, and to yield to the immense\r\ninfluence which Fitzpiers exercised over her whenever she shared his\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nAny observer would shrewdly have prophesied that whether or not she\r\nloved him as yet in the ordinary sense, she was pretty sure to do so in\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nOne evening just before dusk they had taken a rather long walk\r\ntogether, and for a short cut homeward passed through the shrubberies\r\nof Hintock House\xe2\x80\x94still deserted, and still blankly confronting with its\r\nsightless shuttered windows the surrounding foliage and slopes. Grace\r\nwas tired, and they approached the wall, and sat together on one of the\r\nstone sills\xe2\x80\x94still warm with the sun that had been pouring its rays upon\r\nthem all the afternoon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis place would just do for us, would it not, dearest,\xe2\x80\x9d said her\r\nbetrothed, as they sat, turning and looking idly at the old facade.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Grace, plainly showing that no such fancy had ever\r\ncrossed her mind. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is away from home still,\xe2\x80\x9d Grace added in a\r\nminute, rather sadly, for she could not forget that she had somehow\r\nlost the valuable friendship of the lady of this bower.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is?\xe2\x80\x94oh, you mean Mrs. Charmond. Do you know, dear, that at one\r\ntime I thought you lived here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed!\xe2\x80\x9d said Grace. \xe2\x80\x9cHow was that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe explained, as far as he could do so without mentioning his\r\ndisappointment at finding it was otherwise; and then went on: \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\r\nnever mind that. Now I want to ask you something. There is one detail\r\nof our wedding which I am sure you will leave to me. My inclination is\r\nnot to be married at the horrid little church here, with all the yokels\r\nstaring round at us, and a droning parson reading.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere, then, can it be? At a church in town?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Not at a church at all. At a registry office. It is a quieter,\r\nsnugger, and more convenient place in every way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, with real distress. \xe2\x80\x9cHow can I be married except at\r\nchurch, and with all my dear friends round me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYeoman Winterborne among them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94why not? You know there was nothing serious between him and me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, dear, a noisy bell-ringing marriage at church has this\r\nobjection in our case: it would be a thing of report a long way round.\r\nNow I would gently, as gently as possible, indicate to you how\r\ninadvisable such publicity would be if we leave Hintock, and I purchase\r\nthe practice that I contemplate purchasing at Budmouth\xe2\x80\x94hardly more than\r\ntwenty miles off. Forgive my saying that it will be far better if\r\nnobody there knows where you come from, nor anything about your\r\nparents. Your beauty and knowledge and manners will carry you anywhere\r\nif you are not hampered by such retrospective criticism.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut could it not be a quiet ceremony, even at church?\xe2\x80\x9d she pleaded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see the necessity of going there!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, a trifle\r\nimpatiently. \xe2\x80\x9cMarriage is a civil contract, and the shorter and simpler\r\nit is made the better. People don\xe2\x80\x99t go to church when they take a\r\nhouse, or even when they make a will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Edgar\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t like to hear you speak like that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well\xe2\x80\x94I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to. But I have mentioned as much to your\r\nfather, who has made no objection; and why should you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe gave way, deeming the point one on which she ought to allow\r\nsentiment to give way to policy\xe2\x80\x94if there were indeed policy in his\r\nplan. But she was indefinably depressed as they walked homeward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe left her at the door of her father\xe2\x80\x99s house. As he receded, and was\r\nclasped out of sight by the filmy shades, he impressed Grace as a man\r\nwho hardly appertained to her existence at all. Cleverer, greater than\r\nherself, one outside her mental orbit, as she considered him, he seemed\r\nto be her ruler rather than her equal, protector, and dear familiar\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\nThe disappointment she had experienced at his wish, the shock given to\r\nher girlish sensibilities by his irreverent views of marriage, together\r\nwith the sure and near approach of the day fixed for committing her\r\nfuture to his keeping, made her so restless that she could scarcely\r\nsleep at all that night. She rose when the sparrows began to walk out\r\nof the roof-holes, sat on the floor of her room in the dim light, and\r\nby-and-by peeped out behind the window-curtains. It was even now day\r\nout-of-doors, though the tones of morning were feeble and wan, and it\r\nwas long before the sun would be perceptible in this overshadowed vale.\r\nNot a sound came from any of the out-houses as yet. The tree-trunks,\r\nthe road, the out-buildings, the garden, every object wore that aspect\r\nof mesmeric fixity which the suspensive quietude of daybreak lends to\r\nsuch scenes. Outside her window helpless immobility seemed to be\r\ncombined with intense consciousness; a meditative inertness possessed\r\nall things, oppressively contrasting with her own active emotions.\r\nBeyond the road were some cottage roofs and orchards; over these roofs\r\nand over the apple-trees behind, high up the slope, and backed by the\r\nplantation on the crest, was the house yet occupied by her future\r\nhusband, the rough-cast front showing whitely through its creepers. The\r\nwindow-shutters were closed, the bedroom curtains closely drawn, and\r\nnot the thinnest coil of smoke rose from the rugged chimneys.\r\n\r\nSomething broke the stillness. The front door of the house she was\r\ngazing at opened softly, and there came out into the porch a female\r\nfigure, wrapped in a large shawl, beneath which was visible the white\r\nskirt of a long loose garment. A gray arm, stretching from within the\r\nporch, adjusted the shawl over the woman\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders; it was withdrawn\r\nand disappeared, the door closing behind her.\r\n\r\nThe woman went quickly down the box-edged path between the raspberries\r\nand currants, and as she walked her well-developed form and gait\r\nbetrayed her individuality. It was Suke Damson, the affianced one of\r\nsimple young Tim Tangs. At the bottom of the garden she entered the\r\nshelter of the tall hedge, and only the top of her head could be seen\r\nhastening in the direction of her own dwelling.\r\n\r\nGrace had recognized, or thought she recognized, in the gray arm\r\nstretching from the porch, the sleeve of a dressing-gown which Mr.\r\nFitzpiers had been wearing on her own memorable visit to him. Her face\r\nfired red. She had just before thought of dressing herself and taking a\r\nlonely walk under the trees, so coolly green this early morning; but\r\nshe now sat down on her bed and fell into reverie. It seemed as if\r\nhardly any time had passed when she heard the household moving briskly\r\nabout, and breakfast preparing down-stairs; though, on rousing herself\r\nto robe and descend, she found that the sun was throwing his rays\r\ncompletely over the tree-tops, a progress of natural phenomena denoting\r\nthat at least three hours had elapsed since she last looked out of the\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\nWhen attired she searched about the house for her father; she found him\r\nat last in the garden, stooping to examine the potatoes for signs of\r\ndisease. Hearing her rustle, he stood up and stretched his back and\r\narms, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cMorning t\xe2\x80\x99ye, Gracie. I congratulate ye. It is only a\r\nmonth to-day to the time!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe did not answer, but, without lifting her dress, waded between the\r\ndewy rows of tall potato-green into the middle of the plot where he\r\nwas.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been thinking very much about my position this morning\xe2\x80\x94ever\r\nsince it was light,\xe2\x80\x9d she began, excitedly, and trembling so that she\r\ncould hardly stand. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I feel it is a false one. I wish not to marry\r\nMr. Fitzpiers. I wish not to marry anybody; but I\xe2\x80\x99ll marry Giles\r\nWinterborne if you say I must as an alternative.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer father\xe2\x80\x99s face settled into rigidity, he turned pale, and came\r\ndeliberately out of the plot before he answered her. She had never seen\r\nhim look so incensed before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, hearken to me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a time for a woman to alter her\r\nmind; and there\xe2\x80\x99s a time when she can no longer alter it, if she has\r\nany right eye to her parents\xe2\x80\x99 honor and the seemliness of things. That\r\ntime has come. I won\xe2\x80\x99t say to ye, you _shall_ marry him. But I will say\r\nthat if you refuse, I shall forever be ashamed and a-weary of ye as a\r\ndaughter, and shall look upon you as the hope of my life no more. What\r\ndo you know about life and what it can bring forth, and how you ought\r\nto act to lead up to best ends? Oh, you are an ungrateful maid, Grace;\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that fellow Giles, and he has got over ye; that\xe2\x80\x99s where the\r\nsecret lies, I\xe2\x80\x99ll warrant me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, father, no! It is not Giles\xe2\x80\x94it is something I cannot tell you of\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, make fools of us all; make us laughing-stocks; break it off;\r\nhave your own way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut who knows of the engagement as yet? how can breaking it disgrace\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMelbury then by degrees admitted that he had mentioned the engagement\r\nto this acquaintance and to that, till she perceived that in his\r\nrestlessness and pride he had published it everywhere. She went\r\ndismally away to a bower of laurel at the top of the garden. Her father\r\nfollowed her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is that Giles Winterborne!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with an upbraiding gaze at\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it is not; though for that matter you encouraged him once,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid, troubled to the verge of despair. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not Giles, it is Mr.\r\nFitzpiers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve had a tiff\xe2\x80\x94a lovers\xe2\x80\x99 tiff\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s all, I suppose!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is some woman\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay; you are jealous. The old story. Don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me. Now do you bide\r\nhere. I\xe2\x80\x99ll send Fitzpiers to you. I saw him smoking in front of his\r\nhouse but a minute by-gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went off hastily out of the garden-gate and down the lane. But she\r\nwould not stay where she was; and edging through a slit in the\r\ngarden-fence, walked away into the wood. Just about here the trees were\r\nlarge and wide apart, and there was no undergrowth, so that she could\r\nbe seen to some distance; a sylph-like, greenish-white creature, as\r\ntoned by the sunlight and leafage. She heard a foot-fall crushing dead\r\nleaves behind her, and found herself reconnoitered by Fitzpiers\r\nhimself, approaching gay and fresh as the morning around them.\r\n\r\nHis remote gaze at her had been one of mild interest rather than of\r\nrapture. But she looked so lovely in the green world about her, her\r\npink cheeks, her simple light dress, and the delicate flexibility of\r\nher movement acquired such rarity from their wild-wood setting, that\r\nhis eyes kindled as he drew near.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy darling, what is it? Your father says you are in the pouts, and\r\njealous, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what. Ha! ha! ha! as if there were any rival\r\nto you, except vegetable nature, in this home of recluses! We know\r\nbetter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJealous; oh no, it is not so,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, gravely. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a mistake of\r\nhis and yours, sir. I spoke to him so closely about the question of\r\nmarriage with you that he did not apprehend my state of mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut there\xe2\x80\x99s something wrong\xe2\x80\x94eh?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, eying her narrowly, and\r\nbending to kiss her. She shrank away, and his purposed kiss miscarried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, more seriously for this little defeat.\r\n\r\nShe made no answer beyond, \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Fitzpiers, I have had no breakfast, I\r\nmust go in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome,\xe2\x80\x9d he insisted, fixing his eyes upon her. \xe2\x80\x9cTell me at once, I\r\nsay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was the greater strength against the smaller; but she was mastered\r\nless by his manner than by her own sense of the unfairness of silence.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI looked out of the window,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with hesitation. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you\r\nby-and-by. I must go in-doors. I have had no breakfast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy a sort of divination his conjecture went straight to the fact. \xe2\x80\x9cNor\r\nI,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, lightly. \xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, I rose late to-day. I have had a broken\r\nnight, or rather morning. A girl of the village\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t know her\r\nname\xe2\x80\x94came and rang at my bell as soon as it was light\xe2\x80\x94between four and\r\nfive, I should think it was\xe2\x80\x94perfectly maddened with an aching tooth. As\r\nno-body heard her ring, she threw some gravel at my window, till at\r\nlast I heard her and slipped on my dressing-gown and went down. The\r\npoor thing begged me with tears in her eyes to take out her tormentor,\r\nif I dragged her head off. Down she sat and out it came\xe2\x80\x94a lovely molar,\r\nnot a speck upon it; and off she went with it in her handkerchief, much\r\ncontented, though it would have done good work for her for fifty years\r\nto come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was all so plausible\xe2\x80\x94so completely explained. Knowing nothing of the\r\nincident in the wood on old Midsummer-eve, Grace felt that her\r\nsuspicions were unworthy and absurd, and with the readiness of an\r\nhonest heart she jumped at the opportunity of honoring his word. At the\r\nmoment of her mental liberation the bushes about the garden had moved,\r\nand her father emerged into the shady glade. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I hope it is made\r\nup?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, cheerily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fitzpiers, with his eyes fixed on Grace, whose eyes were\r\nshyly bent downward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said her father, \xe2\x80\x9ctell me, the pair of ye, that you still mean\r\nto take one another for good and all; and on the strength o\xe2\x80\x99t you shall\r\nhave another couple of hundred paid down. I swear it by the name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFitzpiers took her hand. \xe2\x80\x9cWe declare it, do we not, my dear Grace?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid he.\r\n\r\nRelieved of her doubt, somewhat overawed, and ever anxious to please,\r\nshe was disposed to settle the matter; yet, womanlike, she would not\r\nrelinquish her opportunity of asking a concession of some sort. \xe2\x80\x9cIf our\r\nwedding can be at church, I say yes,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, in a measured\r\nvoice. \xe2\x80\x9cIf not, I say no.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFitzpiers was generous in his turn. \xe2\x80\x9cIt shall be so,\xe2\x80\x9d he rejoined,\r\ngracefully. \xe2\x80\x9cTo holy church we\xe2\x80\x99ll go, and much good may it do us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey returned through the bushes indoors, Grace walking, full of\r\nthought between the other two, somewhat comforted, both by Fitzpiers\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ningenious explanation and by the sense that she was not to be deprived\r\nof a religious ceremony. \xe2\x80\x9cSo let it be,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to herself. \xe2\x80\x9cPray God\r\nit is for the best.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrom this hour there was no serious attempt at recalcitration on her\r\npart. Fitzpiers kept himself continually near her, dominating any\r\nrebellious impulse, and shaping her will into passive concurrence with\r\nall his desires. Apart from his lover-like anxiety to possess her, the\r\nfew golden hundreds of the timber-dealer, ready to hand, formed a warm\r\nbackground to Grace\xe2\x80\x99s lovely face, and went some way to remove his\r\nuneasiness at the prospect of endangering his professional and social\r\nchances by an alliance with the family of a simple countryman.\r\n\r\nThe interim closed up its perspective surely and silently. Whenever\r\nGrace had any doubts of her position, the sense of contracting time was\r\nlike a shortening chamber: at other moments she was comparatively\r\nblithe. Day after day waxed and waned; the one or two woodmen who\r\nsawed, shaped, spokeshaved on her father\xe2\x80\x99s premises at this inactive\r\nseason of the year, regularly came and unlocked the doors in the\r\nmorning, locked them in the evening, supped, leaned over their\r\ngarden-gates for a whiff of evening air, and to catch any last and\r\nfarthest throb of news from the outer world, which entered and expired\r\nat Little Hintock like the exhausted swell of a wave in some innermost\r\ncavern of some innermost creek of an embayed sea; yet no news\r\ninterfered with the nuptial purpose at their neighbor\xe2\x80\x99s house. The\r\nsappy green twig-tips of the season\xe2\x80\x99s growth would not, she thought, be\r\nappreciably woodier on the day she became a wife, so near was the time;\r\nthe tints of the foliage would hardly have changed. Everything was so\r\nmuch as usual that no itinerant stranger would have supposed a woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfate to be hanging in the balance at that summer\xe2\x80\x99s decline.\r\n\r\nBut there were preparations, imaginable readily enough by those who had\r\nspecial knowledge. In the remote and fashionable town of Sandbourne\r\nsomething was growing up under the hands of several persons who had\r\nnever seen Grace Melbury, never would see her, or care anything about\r\nher at all, though their creation had such interesting relation to her\r\nlife that it would enclose her very heart at a moment when that heart\r\nwould beat, if not with more emotional ardor, at least with more\r\nemotional turbulence than at any previous time.\r\n\r\nWhy did Mrs. Dollery\xe2\x80\x99s van, instead of passing along at the end of the\r\nsmaller village to Great Hintock direct, turn one Saturday night into\r\nLittle Hintock Lane, and never pull up till it reached Mr. Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngates? The gilding shine of evening fell upon a large, flat box not\r\nless than a yard square, and safely tied with cord, as it was handed\r\nout from under the tilt with a great deal of care. But it was not heavy\r\nfor its size; Mrs. Dollery herself carried it into the house. Tim\r\nTangs, the hollow-turner, Bawtree, Suke Damson, and others, looked\r\nknowing, and made remarks to each other as they watched its entrance.\r\nMelbury stood at the door of the timber-shed in the attitude of a man\r\nto whom such an arrival was a trifling domestic detail with which he\r\ndid not condescend to be concerned. Yet he well divined the contents of\r\nthat box, and was in truth all the while in a pleasant exaltation at\r\nthe proof that thus far, at any rate, no disappointment had supervened.\r\nWhile Mrs. Dollery remained\xe2\x80\x94which was rather long, from her sense of\r\nthe importance of her errand\xe2\x80\x94he went into the out-house; but as soon as\r\nshe had had her say, been paid, and had rumbled away, he entered the\r\ndwelling, to find there what he knew he should find\xe2\x80\x94his wife and\r\ndaughter in a flutter of excitement over the wedding-gown, just arrived\r\nfrom the leading dress-maker of Sandbourne watering-place aforesaid.\r\n\r\nDuring these weeks Giles Winterborne was nowhere to be seen or heard\r\nof. At the close of his tenure in Hintock he had sold some of his\r\nfurniture, packed up the rest\xe2\x80\x94a few pieces endeared by associations, or\r\nnecessary to his occupation\xe2\x80\x94in the house of a friendly neighbor, and\r\ngone away. People said that a certain laxity had crept into his life;\r\nthat he had never gone near a church latterly, and had been sometimes\r\nseen on Sundays with unblacked boots, lying on his elbow under a tree,\r\nwith a cynical gaze at surrounding objects. He was likely to return to\r\nHintock when the cider-making season came round, his apparatus being\r\nstored there, and travel with his mill and press from village to\r\nvillage.\r\n\r\nThe narrow interval that stood before the day diminished yet. There was\r\nin Grace\xe2\x80\x99s mind sometimes a certain anticipative satisfaction, the\r\nsatisfaction of feeling that she would be the heroine of an hour;\r\nmoreover, she was proud, as a cultivated woman, to be the wife of a\r\ncultivated man. It was an opportunity denied very frequently to young\r\nwomen in her position, nowadays not a few; those in whom parental\r\ndiscovery of the value of education has implanted tastes which parental\r\ncircles fail to gratify. But what an attenuation was this cold pride of\r\nthe dream of her youth, in which she had pictured herself walking in\r\nstate towards the altar, flushed by the purple light and bloom of her\r\nown passion, without a single misgiving as to the sealing of the bond,\r\nand fervently receiving as her due\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe homage of a thousand hearts; the fond, deep love of one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nEverything had been clear then, in imagination; now something was\r\nundefined. She had little carking anxieties; a curious fatefulness\r\nseemed to rule her, and she experienced a mournful want of some one to\r\nconfide in.\r\n\r\nThe day loomed so big and nigh that her prophetic ear could, in fancy,\r\ncatch the noise of it, hear the murmur of the villagers as she came out\r\nof church, imagine the jangle of the three thin-toned Hintock bells.\r\nThe dialogues seemed to grow louder, and the ding-ding-dong of those\r\nthree crazed bells more persistent. She awoke: the morning had come.\r\n\r\nFive hours later she was the wife of Fitzpiers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chief hotel at Sherton-Abbas was an old stone-fronted inn with a\r\nyawning arch, under which vehicles were driven by stooping coachmen to\r\nback premises of wonderful commodiousness. The windows to the street\r\nwere mullioned into narrow lights, and only commanded a view of the\r\nopposite houses; hence, perhaps, it arose that the best and most\r\nluxurious private sitting-room that the inn could afford over-looked\r\nthe nether parts of the establishment, where beyond the yard were to be\r\nseen gardens and orchards, now bossed, nay incrusted, with scarlet and\r\ngold fruit, stretching to infinite distance under a luminous lavender\r\nmist. The time was early autumn,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen the fair apples, red as evening sky,\r\nDo bend the tree unto the fruitful ground,\r\nWhen juicy pears, and berries of black dye,\r\nDo dance in air, and call the eyes around.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe landscape confronting the window might, indeed, have been part of\r\nthe identical stretch of country which the youthful Chatterton had in\r\nhis mind.\r\n\r\nIn this room sat she who had been the maiden Grace Melbury till the\r\nfinger of fate touched her and turned her to a wife. It was two months\r\nafter the wedding, and she was alone. Fitzpiers had walked out to see\r\nthe abbey by the light of sunset, but she had been too fatigued to\r\naccompany him. They had reached the last stage of a long eight-weeks\xe2\x80\x99\r\ntour, and were going on to Hintock that night.\r\n\r\nIn the yard, between Grace and the orchards, there progressed a scene\r\nnatural to the locality at this time of the year. An apple-mill and\r\npress had been erected on the spot, to which some men were bringing\r\nfruit from divers points in mawn-baskets, while others were grinding\r\nthem, and others wringing down the pomace, whose sweet juice gushed\r\nforth into tubs and pails. The superintendent of these proceedings, to\r\nwhom the others spoke as master, was a young yeoman of prepossessing\r\nmanner and aspect, whose form she recognized in a moment. He had hung\r\nhis coat to a nail of the out-house wall, and wore his shirt-sleeves\r\nrolled up beyond his elbows, to keep them unstained while he rammed the\r\npomace into the bags of horse-hair. Fragments of apple-rind had\r\nalighted upon the brim of his hat\xe2\x80\x94probably from the bursting of a\r\nbag\xe2\x80\x94while brown pips of the same fruit were sticking among the down\r\nupon his fine, round arms.\r\n\r\nShe realized in a moment how he had come there. Down in the heart of\r\nthe apple country nearly every farmer kept up a cider-making apparatus\r\nand wring-house for his own use, building up the pomace in great straw\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccheeses,\xe2\x80\x9d as they were called; but here, on the margin of Pomona\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nplain, was a debatable land neither orchard nor sylvan exclusively,\r\nwhere the apple produce was hardly sufficient to warrant each\r\nproprietor in keeping a mill of his own. This was the field of the\r\ntravelling cider-maker. His press and mill were fixed to wheels instead\r\nof being set up in a cider-house; and with a couple of horses, buckets,\r\ntubs, strainers, and an assistant or two, he wandered from place to\r\nplace, deriving very satisfactory returns for his trouble in such a\r\nprolific season as the present.\r\n\r\nThe back parts of the town were just now abounding with\r\napple-gatherings. They stood in the yards in carts, baskets, and loose\r\nheaps; and the blue, stagnant air of autumn which hung over everything\r\nwas heavy with a sweet cidery smell. Cakes of pomace lay against the\r\nwalls in the yellow sun, where they were drying to be used as fuel. Yet\r\nit was not the great make of the year as yet; before the standard crop\r\ncame in there accumulated, in abundant times like this, a large\r\nsuperfluity of early apples, and windfalls from the trees of later\r\nharvest, which would not keep long. Thus, in the baskets, and quivering\r\nin the hopper of the mill, she saw specimens of mixed dates, including\r\nthe mellow countenances of streaked-jacks, codlins, costards,\r\nstubbards, ratheripes, and other well-known friends of her ravenous\r\nyouth.\r\n\r\nGrace watched the head-man with interest. The slightest sigh escaped\r\nher. Perhaps she thought of the day\xe2\x80\x94not so far distant\xe2\x80\x94when that friend\r\nof her childhood had met her by her father\xe2\x80\x99s arrangement in this same\r\ntown, warm with hope, though diffident, and trusting in a promise\r\nrather implied than given. Or she might have thought of days earlier\r\nyet\xe2\x80\x94days of childhood\xe2\x80\x94when her mouth was somewhat more ready to receive\r\na kiss from his than was his to bestow one. However, all that was over.\r\nShe had felt superior to him then, and she felt superior to him now.\r\n\r\nShe wondered why he never looked towards her open window. She did not\r\nknow that in the slight commotion caused by their arrival at the inn\r\nthat afternoon Winterborne had caught sight of her through the archway,\r\nhad turned red, and was continuing his work with more concentrated\r\nattention on the very account of his discovery. Robert Creedle, too,\r\nwho travelled with Giles, had been incidentally informed by the hostler\r\nthat Dr. Fitzpiers and his young wife were in the hotel, after which\r\nnews Creedle kept shaking his head and saying to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d very\r\naudibly, between his thrusts at the screw of the cider-press.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy the deuce do you sigh like that, Robert?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Winterborne, at\r\nlast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, maister\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99tis my thoughts\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99tis my thoughts!...Yes, ye\xe2\x80\x99ve lost a\r\nhundred load o\xe2\x80\x99 timber well seasoned; ye\xe2\x80\x99ve lost five hundred pound in\r\ngood money; ye\xe2\x80\x99ve lost the stone-windered house that\xe2\x80\x99s big enough to\r\nhold a dozen families; ye\xe2\x80\x99ve lost your share of half a dozen good\r\nwagons and their horses\xe2\x80\x94all lost!\xe2\x80\x94through your letting slip she that\r\nwas once yer own!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood God, Creedle, you\xe2\x80\x99ll drive me mad!\xe2\x80\x9d said Giles, sternly. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nspeak of that any more!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus the subject had ended in the yard. Meanwhile, the passive cause of\r\nall this loss still regarded the scene. She was beautifully dressed;\r\nshe was seated in the most comfortable room that the inn afforded; her\r\nlong journey had been full of variety, and almost luxuriously\r\nperformed\xe2\x80\x94for Fitzpiers did not study economy where pleasure was in\r\nquestion. Hence it perhaps arose that Giles and all his belongings\r\nseemed sorry and common to her for the moment\xe2\x80\x94moving in a plane so far\r\nremoved from her own of late that she could scarcely believe she had\r\never found congruity therein. \xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94I could never have married him!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid, gently shaking her head. \xe2\x80\x9cDear father was right. It would have\r\nbeen too coarse a life for me.\xe2\x80\x9d And she looked at the rings of sapphire\r\nand opal upon her white and slender fingers that had been gifts from\r\nFitzpiers.\r\n\r\nSeeing that Giles still kept his back turned, and with a little of the\r\nabove-described pride of life\xe2\x80\x94easily to be understood, and possibly\r\nexcused, in a young, inexperienced woman who thought she had married\r\nwell\xe2\x80\x94she said at last, with a smile on her lips, \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Winterborne!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe appeared to take no heed, and she said a second time, \xe2\x80\x9cMr.\r\nWinterborne!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEven now he seemed not to hear, though a person close enough to him to\r\nsee the expression of his face might have doubted it; and she said a\r\nthird time, with a timid loudness, \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Winterborne! What, have you\r\nforgotten my voice?\xe2\x80\x9d She remained with her lips parted in a welcoming\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\nHe turned without surprise, and came deliberately towards the window.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you call me?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with a sternness that took her\r\ncompletely unawares, his face being now pale. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it not enough that\r\nyou see me here moiling and muddling for my daily bread while you are\r\nsitting there in your success, that you can\xe2\x80\x99t refrain from opening old\r\nwounds by calling out my name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe flushed, and was struck dumb for some moments; but she forgave his\r\nunreasoning anger, knowing so well in what it had its root. \xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry\r\nI offended you by speaking,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, meekly. \xe2\x80\x9cBelieve me, I did\r\nnot intend to do that. I could hardly sit here so near you without a\r\nword of recognition.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWinterborne\xe2\x80\x99s heart had swollen big, and his eyes grown moist by this\r\ntime, so much had the gentle answer of that familiar voice moved him.\r\nHe assured her hurriedly, and without looking at her, that he was not\r\nangry. He then managed to ask her, in a clumsy, constrained way, if she\r\nhad had a pleasant journey, and seen many interesting sights. She spoke\r\nof a few places that she had visited, and so the time passed till he\r\nwithdrew to take his place at one of the levers which pulled round the\r\nscrew.\r\n\r\nForgotten her voice! Indeed, he had not forgotten her voice, as his\r\nbitterness showed. But though in the heat of the moment he had\r\nreproached her keenly, his second mood was a far more tender one\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nwhich could regard her renunciation of such as he as her glory and her\r\nprivilege, his own fidelity notwithstanding. He could have declared\r\nwith a contemporary poet\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n                    \xe2\x80\x9cIf I forget,\r\nThe salt creek may forget the ocean;\r\n                    If I forget\r\nThe heart whence flows my heart\xe2\x80\x99s bright motion,\r\nMay I sink meanlier than the worst\r\nAbandoned, outcast, crushed, accurst,\r\n                    If I forget.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \xe2\x80\x9cThough you forget,\r\nNo word of mine shall mar your pleasure;\r\n                    Though you forget,\r\nYou filled my barren life with treasure,\r\nYou may withdraw the gift you gave;\r\nYou still are queen, I still am slave,\r\n                    Though you forget.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nShe had tears in her eyes at the thought that she could not remind him\r\nof what he ought to have remembered; that not herself but the pressure\r\nof events had dissipated the dreams of their early youth. Grace was\r\nthus unexpectedly worsted in her encounter with her old friend. She had\r\nopened the window with a faint sense of triumph, but he had turned it\r\ninto sadness; she did not quite comprehend the reason why. In truth it\r\nwas because she was not cruel enough in her cruelty. If you have to use\r\nthe knife, use it, say the great surgeons; and for her own peace Grace\r\nshould have contemned Winterborne thoroughly or not at all. As it was,\r\non closing the window an indescribable, some might have said dangerous,\r\npity quavered in her bosom for him.\r\n\r\nPresently her husband entered the room, and told her what a wonderful\r\nsunset there was to be seen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not noticed it. But I have seen somebody out there that we\r\nknow,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, looking into the court.\r\n\r\nFitzpiers followed the direction of her eyes, and said he did not\r\nrecognize anybody.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Mr. Winterborne\xe2\x80\x94there he is, cider-making. He combines that with\r\nhis other business, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x94that fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fitzpiers, his curiosity becoming extinct.\r\n\r\nShe, reproachfully: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat, call Mr. Winterborne a fellow, Edgar? It is\r\ntrue I was just saying to myself that I never could have married him;\r\nbut I have much regard for him, and always shall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, do by all means, my dear one. I dare say I am inhuman, and\r\nsupercilious, and contemptibly proud of my poor old ramshackle family;\r\nbut I do honestly confess to you that I feel as if I belonged to a\r\ndifferent species from the people who are working in that yard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd from me too, then. For my blood is no better than theirs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at her with a droll sort of awakening. It was, indeed, a\r\nstartling anomaly that this woman of the tribe without should be\r\nstanding there beside him as his wife, if his sentiments were as he had\r\nsaid. In their travels together she had ranged so unerringly at his\r\nlevel in ideas, tastes, and habits that he had almost forgotten how his\r\nheart had played havoc with his principles in taking her to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh YOU\xe2\x80\x94you are refined and educated into something quite different,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said, self-assuringly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t quite like to think that,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured with soft regret. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nI think you underestimate Giles Winterborne. Remember, I was brought up\r\nwith him till I was sent away to school, so I cannot be radically\r\ndifferent. At any rate, I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel so. That is, no doubt, my fault,\r\nand a great blemish in me. But I hope you will put up with it, Edgar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFitzpiers said that he would endeavor to do so; and as it was now\r\ngetting on for dusk, they prepared to perform the last stage of their\r\njourney, so as to arrive at Hintock before it grew very late.\r\n\r\nIn less than half an hour they started, the cider-makers in the yard\r\nhaving ceased their labors and gone away, so that the only sounds\r\naudible there now were the trickling of the juice from the tightly\r\nscrewed press, and the buzz of a single wasp, which had drunk itself so\r\ntipsy that it was unconscious of nightfall. Grace was very cheerful at\r\nthe thought of being soon in her sylvan home, but Fitzpiers sat beside\r\nher almost silent. An indescribable oppressiveness had overtaken him\r\nwith the near approach of the journey\xe2\x80\x99s end and the realities of life\r\nthat lay there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t say a word, Edgar,\xe2\x80\x9d she observed. \xe2\x80\x9cAren\xe2\x80\x99t you glad to get\r\nback? I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have friends here. I have none.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut my friends are yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes\xe2\x80\x94in that sense.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe conversation languished, and they drew near the end of Hintock\r\nLane. It had been decided that they should, at least for a time, take\r\nup their abode in her father\xe2\x80\x99s roomy house, one wing of which was quite\r\nat their service, being almost disused by the Melburys. Workmen had\r\nbeen painting, papering, and whitewashing this set of rooms in the\r\nwedded pair\xe2\x80\x99s absence; and so scrupulous had been the timber-dealer\r\nthat there should occur no hitch or disappointment on their arrival,\r\nthat not the smallest detail remained undone. To make it all complete a\r\nground-floor room had been fitted up as a surgery, with an independent\r\nouter door, to which Fitzpiers\xe2\x80\x99s brass plate was screwed\xe2\x80\x94for mere\r\nornament, such a sign being quite superfluous where everybody knew the\r\nlatitude and longitude of his neighbors for miles round.\r\n\r\nMelbury and his wife welcomed the twain with affection, and all the\r\nhouse with deference. They went up to explore their rooms, that opened\r\nfrom a passage on the left hand of the staircase, the entrance to which\r\ncould be shut off on the landing by a door that Melbury had hung for\r\nthe purpose. A friendly fire was burning in the grate, although it was\r\nnot cold. Fitzpiers said it was too soon for any sort of meal, they\r\nonly having dined shortly before leaving Sherton-Abbas. He would walk\r\nacross to his old lodging, to learn how his locum tenens had got on in\r\nhis absence.\r\n\r\nIn leaving Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s door he looked back at the house. There was\r\neconomy in living under that roof, and economy was desirable, but in\r\nsome way he was dissatisfied with the arrangement; it immersed him so\r\ndeeply in son-in-lawship to Melbury. He went on to his former\r\nresidence. His deputy was out, and Fitzpiers fell into conversation\r\nwith his former landlady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mrs. Cox, what\xe2\x80\x99s the best news?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked of her, with cheery\r\nweariness.\r\n\r\nShe was a little soured at losing by his marriage so profitable a\r\ntenant as the surgeon had proved to be during his residence under her\r\nroof; and the more so in there being hardly the remotest chance of her\r\ngetting such another settler in the Hintock solitudes. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis what I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t wish to repeat, sir; least of all to you,\xe2\x80\x9d she mumbled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind me, Mrs. Cox; go ahead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is what people say about your hasty marrying, Dr. Fitzpiers.\r\nWhereas they won\xe2\x80\x99t believe you know such clever doctrines in physic as\r\nthey once supposed of ye, seeing as you could marry into Mr. Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfamily, which is only Hintock-born, such as me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are kindly welcome to their opinion,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fitzpiers, not\r\nallowing himself to recognize that he winced. \xe2\x80\x9cAnything else?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; _she\xe2\x80\x99s_ come home at last.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s she?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Charmond.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d said Fitzpiers, with but slight interest. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never\r\nseen her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has seen you, sir, whether or no.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; she saw you in some hotel or street for a minute or two while you\r\nwere away travelling, and accidentally heard your name; and when she\r\nmade some remark about you, Miss Ellis\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s her maid\xe2\x80\x94told her you was\r\non your wedding-tower with Mr. Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s daughter; and she said, \xe2\x80\x98He\r\nought to have done better than that. I fear he has spoiled his\r\nchances,\xe2\x80\x99 she says.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFitzpiers did not talk much longer to this cheering housewife, and\r\nwalked home with no very brisk step. He entered the door quietly, and\r\nwent straight up-stairs to the drawing-room extemporized for their use\r\nby Melbury in his and his bride\xe2\x80\x99s absence, expecting to find her there\r\nas he had left her. The fire was burning still, but there were no\r\nlights. He looked into the next apartment, fitted up as a little\r\ndining-room, but no supper was laid. He went to the top of the stairs,\r\nand heard a chorus of voices in the timber-merchant\xe2\x80\x99s parlor below,\r\nGrace\xe2\x80\x99s being occasionally intermingled.\r\n\r\nDescending, and looking into the room from the door-way, he found quite\r\na large gathering of neighbors and other acquaintances, praising and\r\ncongratulating Mrs. Fitzpiers on her return, among them being the\r\ndairyman, Farmer Bawtree, and the master-blacksmith from Great Hintock;\r\nalso the cooper, the hollow-turner, the exciseman, and some others,\r\nwith their wives, who lived hard by. Grace, girl that she was, had\r\nquite forgotten her new dignity and her husband\xe2\x80\x99s; she was in the midst\r\nof them, blushing, and receiving their compliments with all the\r\npleasure of old-comradeship.\r\n\r\nFitzpiers experienced a profound distaste for the situation. Melbury\r\nwas nowhere in the room, but Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s wife, perceiving the doctor,\r\ncame to him. \xe2\x80\x9cWe thought, Grace and I,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat as they have\r\ncalled, hearing you were come, we could do no less than ask them to\r\nsupper; and then Grace proposed that we should all sup together, as it\r\nis the first night of your return.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy this time Grace had come round to him. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it not good of them to\r\nwelcome me so warmly?\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, with tears of friendship in her\r\neyes. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter so much good feeling I could not think of our shutting\r\nourselves up away from them in our own dining-room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not\xe2\x80\x94certainly not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fitzpiers; and he entered the room\r\nwith the heroic smile of a martyr.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they sat down to table Melbury came in, and seemed to see at\r\nonce that Fitzpiers would much rather have received no such\r\ndemonstrative reception. He thereupon privately chid his wife for her\r\nforwardness in the matter. Mrs. Melbury declared that it was as much\r\nGrace\xe2\x80\x99s doing as hers, after which there was no more to be said by that\r\nyoung woman\xe2\x80\x99s tender father. By this time Fitzpiers was making the best\r\nof his position among the wide-elbowed and genial company who sat\r\neating and drinking and laughing and joking around him; and getting\r\nwarmed himself by the good cheer, was obliged to admit that, after all,\r\nthe supper was not the least enjoyable he had ever known.\r\n\r\nAt times, however, the words about his having spoiled his\r\nopportunities, repeated to him as those of Mrs. Charmond, haunted him\r\nlike a handwriting on the wall. Then his manner would become suddenly\r\nabstracted. At one moment he would mentally put an indignant query why\r\nMrs. Charmond or any other woman should make it her business to have\r\nopinions about his opportunities; at another he thought that he could\r\nhardly be angry with her for taking an interest in the doctor of her\r\nown parish. Then he would drink a glass of grog and so get rid of the\r\nmisgiving. These hitches and quaffings were soon perceived by Grace as\r\nwell as by her father; and hence both of them were much relieved when\r\nthe first of the guests to discover that the hour was growing late rose\r\nand declared that he must think of moving homeward. At the words\r\nMelbury rose as alertly as if lifted by a spring, and in ten minutes\r\nthey were gone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Grace,\xe2\x80\x9d said her husband as soon as he found himself alone with\r\nher in their private apartments, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99ve had a very pleasant evening,\r\nand everybody has been very kind. But we must come to an understanding\r\nabout our way of living here. If we continue in these rooms there must\r\nbe no mixing in with your people below. I can\xe2\x80\x99t stand it, and that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe truth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had been sadly surprised at the suddenness of his distaste for\r\nthose old-fashioned woodland forms of life which in his courtship he\r\nhad professed to regard with so much interest. But she assented in a\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must be simply your father\xe2\x80\x99s tenants,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cand our\r\ngoings and comings must be as independent as if we lived elsewhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, Edgar\xe2\x80\x94I quite see that it must be so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you joined in with all those people in my absence, without knowing\r\nwhether I should approve or disapprove. When I came I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help\r\nmyself at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe, sighing: \xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94I see I ought to have waited; though they came\r\nunexpectedly, and I thought I had acted for the best.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus the discussion ended, and the next day Fitzpiers went on his old\r\nrounds as usual. But it was easy for so super-subtle an eye as his to\r\ndiscern, or to think he discerned, that he was no longer regarded as an\r\nextrinsic, unfathomed gentleman of limitless potentiality, scientific\r\nand social; but as Mr. Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s compeer, and therefore in a degree\r\nonly one of themselves. The Hintock woodlandlers held with all the\r\nstrength of inherited conviction to the aristocratic principle, and as\r\nsoon as they had discovered that Fitzpiers was one of the old Buckbury\r\nFitzpierses they had accorded to him for nothing a touching of\r\nhat-brims, promptness of service, and deference of approach, which\r\nMelbury had to do without, though he paid for it over and over. But\r\nnow, having proved a traitor to his own cause by this marriage,\r\nFitzpiers was believed in no more as a superior hedged by his own\r\ndivinity; while as doctor he began to be rated no higher than old\r\nJones, whom they had so long despised.\r\n\r\nHis few patients seemed in his two months\xe2\x80\x99 absence to have dwindled\r\nconsiderably in number, and no sooner had he returned than there came\r\nto him from the Board of Guardians a complaint that a pauper had been\r\nneglected by his substitute. In a fit of pride Fitzpiers resigned his\r\nappointment as one of the surgeons to the union, which had been the\r\nnucleus of his practice here.\r\n\r\nAt the end of a fortnight he came in-doors one evening to Grace more\r\nbriskly than usual. \xe2\x80\x9cThey have written to me again about that practice\r\nin Budmouth that I once negotiated for,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to her. \xe2\x80\x9cThe premium\r\nasked is eight hundred pounds, and I think that between your father and\r\nmyself it ought to be raised. Then we can get away from this place\r\nforever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe question had been mooted between them before, and she was not\r\nunprepared to consider it. They had not proceeded far with the\r\ndiscussion when a knock came to the door, and in a minute Grammer ran\r\nup to say that a message had arrived from Hintock House requesting Dr.\r\nFitzpiers to attend there at once. Mrs. Charmond had met with a slight\r\naccident through the overturning of her carriage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is something, anyhow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fitzpiers, rising with an interest\r\nwhich he could not have defined. \xe2\x80\x9cI have had a presentiment that this\r\nmysterious woman and I were to be better acquainted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe latter words were murmured to himself alone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-night,\xe2\x80\x9d said Grace, as soon as he was ready. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall be asleep,\r\nprobably, when you return.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-night,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, inattentively, and went down-stairs. It was\r\nthe first time since their marriage that he had left her without a\r\nkiss.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nWinterborne\xe2\x80\x99s house had been pulled down. On this account his face had\r\nbeen seen but fitfully in Hintock; and he would probably have\r\ndisappeared from the place altogether but for his slight business\r\nconnection with Melbury, on whose premises Giles kept his cider-making\r\napparatus, now that he had no place of his own to stow it in. Coming\r\nhere one evening on his way to a hut beyond the wood where he now\r\nslept, he noticed that the familiar brown-thatched pinion of his\r\npaternal roof had vanished from its site, and that the walls were\r\nlevelled. In present circumstances he had a feeling for the spot that\r\nmight have been called morbid, and when he had supped in the hut\r\naforesaid he made use of the spare hour before bedtime to return to\r\nLittle Hintock in the twilight and ramble over the patch of ground on\r\nwhich he had first seen the day.\r\n\r\nHe repeated this evening visit on several like occasions. Even in the\r\ngloom he could trace where the different rooms had stood; could mark\r\nthe shape of the kitchen chimney-corner, in which he had roasted apples\r\nand potatoes in his boyhood, cast his bullets, and burned his initials\r\non articles that did and did not belong to him. The apple-trees still\r\nremained to show where the garden had been, the oldest of them even now\r\nretaining the crippled slant to north-east given them by the great\r\nNovember gale of 1824, which carried a brig bodily over the Chesil\r\nBank. They were at present bent to still greater obliquity by the\r\nheaviness of their produce. Apples bobbed against his head, and in the\r\ngrass beneath he crunched scores of them as he walked. There was nobody\r\nto gather them now.\r\n\r\nIt was on the evening under notice that, half sitting, half leaning\r\nagainst one of these inclined trunks, Winterborne had become lost in\r\nhis thoughts, as usual, till one little star after another had taken up\r\na position in the piece of sky which now confronted him where his walls\r\nand chimneys had formerly raised their outlines. The house had jutted\r\nawkwardly into the road, and the opening caused by its absence was very\r\ndistinct.\r\n\r\nIn the silence the trot of horses and the spin of carriage-wheels\r\nbecame audible; and the vehicle soon shaped itself against the blank\r\nsky, bearing down upon him with the bend in the lane which here\r\noccurred, and of which the house had been the cause. He could discern\r\nthe figure of a woman high up on the driving-seat of a phaeton, a groom\r\nbeing just visible behind. Presently there was a slight scrape, then a\r\nscream. Winterborne went across to the spot, and found the phaeton half\r\noverturned, its driver sitting on the heap of rubbish which had once\r\nbeen his dwelling, and the man seizing the horses\xe2\x80\x99 heads. The equipage\r\nwas Mrs. Charmond\xe2\x80\x99s, and the unseated charioteer that lady herself.\r\n\r\nTo his inquiry if she were hurt she made some incoherent reply to the\r\neffect that she did not know. The damage in other respects was little\r\nor none: the phaeton was righted, Mrs. Charmond placed in it, and the\r\nreins given to the servant. It appeared that she had been deceived by\r\nthe removal of the house, imagining the gap caused by the demolition to\r\nbe the opening of the road, so that she turned in upon the ruins\r\ninstead of at the bend a few yards farther on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDrive home\xe2\x80\x94drive home!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the lady, impatiently; and they started\r\non their way. They had not, however, gone many paces when, the air\r\nbeing still, Winterborne heard her say \xe2\x80\x9cStop; tell that man to call the\r\ndoctor\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Fitzpiers\xe2\x80\x94and send him on to the House. I find I am hurt\r\nmore seriously than I thought.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWinterborne took the message from the groom and proceeded to the\r\ndoctor\xe2\x80\x99s at once. Having delivered it, he stepped back into the\r\ndarkness, and waited till he had seen Fitzpiers leave the door. He\r\nstood for a few minutes looking at the window which by its light\r\nrevealed the room where Grace was sitting, and went away under the\r\ngloomy trees.\r\n\r\nFitzpiers duly arrived at Hintock House, whose doors he now saw open\r\nfor the first time. Contrary to his expectation there was visible no\r\nsign of that confusion or alarm which a serious accident to the\r\nmistress of the abode would have occasioned. He was shown into a room\r\nat the top of the staircase, cosily and femininely draped, where, by\r\nthe light of the shaded lamp, he saw a woman of full round figure\r\nreclining upon a couch in such a position as not to disturb a pile of\r\nmagnificent hair on the crown of her head. A deep purple dressing-gown\r\nformed an admirable foil to the peculiarly rich brown of her\r\nhair-plaits; her left arm, which was naked nearly up to the shoulder,\r\nwas thrown upward, and between the fingers of her right hand she held a\r\ncigarette, while she idly breathed from her plump lips a thin stream of\r\nsmoke towards the ceiling.\r\n\r\nThe doctor\xe2\x80\x99s first feeling was a sense of his exaggerated prevision in\r\nhaving brought appliances for a serious case; the next, something more\r\ncurious. While the scene and the moment were new to him and\r\nunanticipated, the sentiment and essence of the moment were\r\nindescribably familiar. What could be the cause of it? Probably a\r\ndream.\r\n\r\nMrs. Charmond did not move more than to raise her eyes to him, and he\r\ncame and stood by her. She glanced up at his face across her brows and\r\nforehead, and then he observed a blush creep slowly over her decidedly\r\nhandsome cheeks. Her eyes, which had lingered upon him with an\r\ninquiring, conscious expression, were hastily withdrawn, and she\r\nmechanically applied the cigarette again to her lips.\r\n\r\nFor a moment he forgot his errand, till suddenly arousing himself he\r\naddressed her, formally condoled with her, and made the usual\r\nprofessional inquiries about what had happened to her, and where she\r\nwas hurt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what I want you to tell me,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured, in tones of\r\nindefinable reserve. \xe2\x80\x9cI quite believe in you, for I know you are very\r\naccomplished, because you study so hard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll do my best to justify your good opinion,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man,\r\nbowing. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd none the less that I am happy to find the accident has not\r\nbeen serious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very much shaken,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied; and completed his examination, which convinced\r\nhim that there was really nothing the matter with her, and more than\r\never puzzled him as to why he had been fetched, since she did not\r\nappear to be a timid woman. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must rest a while, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll send\r\nsomething,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I forgot,\xe2\x80\x9d she returned. \xe2\x80\x9cLook here.\xe2\x80\x9d And she showed him a little\r\nscrape on her arm\xe2\x80\x94the full round arm that was exposed. \xe2\x80\x9cPut some\r\ncourt-plaster on that, please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe obeyed. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd now,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cbefore you go I want to put a question\r\nto you. Sit round there in front of me, on that low chair, and bring\r\nthe candles, or one, to the little table. Do you smoke? Yes? That\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nright\xe2\x80\x94I am learning. Take one of these; and here\xe2\x80\x99s a light.\xe2\x80\x9d She threw\r\na matchbox across.\r\n\r\nFitzpiers caught it, and having lit up, regarded her from his new\r\nposition, which, with the shifting of the candles, for the first time\r\nafforded him a full view of her face. \xe2\x80\x9cHow many years have passed since\r\nfirst we met!\xe2\x80\x9d she resumed, in a voice which she mainly endeavored to\r\nmaintain at its former pitch of composure, and eying him with daring\r\nbashfulness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_We_ met, do you say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cI saw you recently at an hotel in London, when you were\r\npassing through, I suppose, with your bride, and I recognized you as\r\none I had met in my girlhood. Do you remember, when you were studying\r\nat Heidelberg, an English family that was staying there, who used to\r\nwalk\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the young lady who wore a long tail of rare-colored hair\xe2\x80\x94ah, I see\r\nit before my eyes!\xe2\x80\x94who lost her gloves on the Great Terrace\xe2\x80\x94who was\r\ngoing back in the dusk to find them\xe2\x80\x94to whom I said, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll go for them,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nand you said, \xe2\x80\x98Oh, they are not worth coming all the way up again for.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nI _do_ remember, and how very long we stayed talking there! I went next\r\nmorning while the dew was on the grass: there they lay\xe2\x80\x94the little\r\nfingers sticking out damp and thin. I see them now! I picked them up,\r\nand then\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI kissed them,\xe2\x80\x9d he rejoined, rather shamefacedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you had hardly ever seen me except in the dusk?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind. I was young then, and I kissed them. I wondered how I\r\ncould make the most of my _trouvaille_, and decided that I would call\r\nat your hotel with them that afternoon. It rained, and I waited till\r\nnext day. I called, and you were gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d answered she, with dry melancholy. \xe2\x80\x9cMy mother, knowing my\r\ndisposition, said she had no wish for such a chit as me to go falling\r\nin love with an impecunious student, and spirited me away to Baden. As\r\nit is all over and past I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you one thing: I should have sent you\r\na line passing warm had I known your name. That name I never knew till\r\nmy maid said, as you passed up the hotel stairs a month ago, \xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nDr. Fitzpiers.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood Heaven!\xe2\x80\x9d said Fitzpiers, musingly. \xe2\x80\x9cHow the time comes back to\r\nme! The evening, the morning, the dew, the spot. When I found that you\r\nreally were gone it was as if a cold iron had been passed down my back.\r\nI went up to where you had stood when I last saw you\xe2\x80\x94I flung myself on\r\nthe grass, and\xe2\x80\x94being not much more than a boy\xe2\x80\x94my eyes were literally\r\nblinded with tears. Nameless, unknown to me as you were, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nforget your voice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor how long?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x94ever so long. Days and days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDays and days! _Only_ days and days? Oh, the heart of a man! Days and\r\ndays!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, my dear madam, I had not known you more than a day or two. It was\r\nnot a full-blown love\xe2\x80\x94it was the merest bud\xe2\x80\x94red, fresh, vivid, but\r\nsmall. It was a colossal passion in posse, a giant in embryo. It never\r\nmatured.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo much the better, perhaps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps. But see how powerless is the human will against\r\npredestination. We were prevented meeting; we have met. One feature of\r\nthe case remains the same amid many changes. You are still rich, and I\r\nam still poor. Better than that, you have (judging by your last remark)\r\noutgrown the foolish, impulsive passions of your early girl-hood. I\r\nhave not outgrown mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, with vibrations of strong feeling in her\r\nwords. \xe2\x80\x9cI have been placed in a position which hinders such\r\noutgrowings. Besides, I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that the genuine subjects of\r\nemotion do outgrow them; I believe that the older such people get the\r\nworse they are. Possibly at ninety or a hundred they may feel they are\r\ncured; but a mere threescore and ten won\xe2\x80\x99t do it\xe2\x80\x94at least for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe gazed at her in undisguised admiration. Here was a soul of souls!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Charmond, you speak truly,\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you speak sadly as\r\nwell. Why is that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI always am sad when I come here,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, dropping to a low tone\r\nwith a sense of having been too demonstrative.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen may I inquire why you came?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA man brought me. Women are always carried about like corks upon the\r\nwaves of masculine desires....I hope I have not alarmed you; but\r\nHintock has the curious effect of bottling up the emotions till one can\r\nno longer hold them; I am often obliged to fly away and discharge my\r\nsentiments somewhere, or I should die outright.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is very good society in the county for those who have the\r\nprivilege of entering it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps so. But the misery of remote country life is that your\r\nneighbors have no toleration for difference of opinion and habit. My\r\nneighbors think I am an atheist, except those who think I am a Roman\r\nCatholic; and when I speak disrespectfully of the weather or the crops\r\nthey think I am a blasphemer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe broke into a low musical laugh at the idea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t wish me to stay any longer?\xe2\x80\x9d he inquired, when he found that\r\nshe remained musing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94I think not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen tell me that I am to be gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy? Cannot you go without?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI may consult my own feelings only, if left to myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if you do, what then? Do you suppose you\xe2\x80\x99ll be in my way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI feared it might be so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen fear no more. But good-night. Come to-morrow and see if I am\r\ngoing on right. This renewal of acquaintance touches me. I have already\r\na friendship for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it depends upon myself it shall last forever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy best hopes that it may. Good-by.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFitzpiers went down the stairs absolutely unable to decide whether she\r\nhad sent for him in the natural alarm which might have followed her\r\nmishap, or with the single view of making herself known to him as she\r\nhad done, for which the capsize had afforded excellent opportunity.\r\nOutside the house he mused over the spot under the light of the stars.\r\nIt seemed very strange that he should have come there more than once\r\nwhen its inhabitant was absent, and observed the house with a nameless\r\ninterest; that he should have assumed off-hand before he knew Grace\r\nthat it was here she lived; that, in short, at sundry times and seasons\r\nthe individuality of Hintock House should have forced itself upon him\r\nas appertaining to some existence with which he was concerned.\r\n\r\nThe intersection of his temporal orbit with Mrs. Charmond\xe2\x80\x99s for a day\r\nor two in the past had created a sentimental interest in her at the\r\ntime, but it had been so evanescent that in the ordinary onward roll of\r\naffairs he would scarce ever have recalled it again. To find her here,\r\nhowever, in these somewhat romantic circumstances, magnified that\r\nby-gone and transitory tenderness to indescribable proportions.\r\n\r\nOn entering Little Hintock he found himself regarding it in a new\r\nway\xe2\x80\x94from the Hintock House point of view rather than from his own and\r\nthe Melburys\xe2\x80\x99. The household had all gone to bed, and as he went\r\nup-stairs he heard the snore of the timber-merchant from his quarter of\r\nthe building, and turned into the passage communicating with his own\r\nrooms in a strange access of sadness. A light was burning for him in\r\nthe chamber; but Grace, though in bed, was not asleep. In a moment her\r\nsympathetic voice came from behind the curtains.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEdgar, is she very seriously hurt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFitzpiers had so entirely lost sight of Mrs. Charmond as a patient that\r\nhe was not on the instant ready with a reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are no bones broken, but she is shaken. I am\r\ngoing again to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnother inquiry or two, and Grace said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid she ask for me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94I think she did\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t quite remember; but I am under the\r\nimpression that she spoke of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCannot you recollect at all what she said?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot, just this minute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt any rate she did not talk much about me?\xe2\x80\x9d said Grace with\r\ndisappointment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you did, perhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, innocently fishing for a compliment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes\xe2\x80\x94you may depend upon that!\xe2\x80\x9d replied he, warmly, though scarcely\r\nthinking of what he was saying, so vividly was there present to his\r\nmind the personality of Mrs. Charmond.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe doctor\xe2\x80\x99s professional visit to Hintock House was promptly repeated\r\nthe next day and the next. He always found Mrs. Charmond reclining on a\r\nsofa, and behaving generally as became a patient who was in no great\r\nhurry to lose that title. On each occasion he looked gravely at the\r\nlittle scratch on her arm, as if it had been a serious wound.\r\n\r\nHe had also, to his further satisfaction, found a slight scar on her\r\ntemple, and it was very convenient to put a piece of black plaster on\r\nthis conspicuous part of her person in preference to gold-beater\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nskin, so that it might catch the eyes of the servants, and make his\r\npresence appear decidedly necessary, in case there should be any doubt\r\nof the fact.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x94you hurt me!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed one day.\r\n\r\nHe was peeling off the bit of plaster on her arm, under which the\r\nscrape had turned the color of an unripe blackberry previous to\r\nvanishing altogether. \xe2\x80\x9cWait a moment, then\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll damp it,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nFitzpiers. He put his lips to the place and kept them there till the\r\nplaster came off easily. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was at your request I put it on,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied. \xe2\x80\x9cIs that blue vein still in my temple that\r\nused to show there? The scar must be just upon it. If the cut had been\r\na little deeper it would have spilt my hot blood indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d Fitzpiers\r\nexamined so closely that his breath touched her tenderly, at which\r\ntheir eyes rose to an encounter\xe2\x80\x94hers showing themselves as deep and\r\nmysterious as interstellar space. She turned her face away suddenly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! none of that! none of that\xe2\x80\x94I cannot coquet with you!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t suppose I consent to for one moment. Our poor, brief, youthful\r\nhour of love-making was too long ago to bear continuing now. It is as\r\nwell that we should understand each other on that point before we go\r\nfurther.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCoquet! Nor I with you. As it was when I found the historic gloves, so\r\nit is now. I might have been and may be foolish; but I am no trifler. I\r\nnaturally cannot forget that little space in which I flitted across the\r\nfield of your vision in those days of the past, and the recollection\r\nopens up all sorts of imaginings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose my mother had not taken me away?\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured, her dreamy\r\neyes resting on the swaying tip of a distant tree.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should have seen you again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen the fire would have burned higher and higher. What would have\r\nimmediately followed I know not; but sorrow and sickness of heart at\r\nlast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s the end of all love, according to Nature\xe2\x80\x99s law. I can give\r\nno other reason.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t speak like that,\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cSince we are only\r\npicturing the possibilities of that time, don\xe2\x80\x99t, for pity\xe2\x80\x99s sake, spoil\r\nthe picture.\xe2\x80\x9d Her voice sank almost to a whisper as she added, with an\r\nincipient pout upon her full lips, \xe2\x80\x9cLet me think at least that if you\r\nhad really loved me at all seriously, you would have loved me for ever\r\nand ever!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are right\xe2\x80\x94think it with all your heart,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a\r\npleasant thought, and costs nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe weighed that remark in silence a while. \xe2\x80\x9cDid you ever hear anything\r\nof me from then till now?\xe2\x80\x9d she inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a word.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo much the better. I had to fight the battle of life as well as you.\r\nI may tell you about it some day. But don\xe2\x80\x99t ever ask me to do it, and\r\nparticularly do not press me to tell you now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus the two or three days that they had spent in tender acquaintance\r\non the romantic slopes above the Neckar were stretched out in\r\nretrospect to the length and importance of years; made to form a canvas\r\nfor infinite fancies, idle dreams, luxurious melancholies, and sweet,\r\nalluring assertions which could neither be proved nor disproved. Grace\r\nwas never mentioned between them, but a rumor of his proposed domestic\r\nchanges somehow reached her ears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoctor, you are going away,\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, confronting him with\r\naccusatory reproach in her large dark eyes no less than in her rich\r\ncooing voice. \xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, you are,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, springing to her feet\r\nwith an air which might almost have been called passionate. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is no\r\nuse denying it. You have bought a practice at Budmouth. I don\xe2\x80\x99t blame\r\nyou. Nobody can live at Hintock\xe2\x80\x94least of all a professional man who\r\nwants to keep abreast of recent discovery. And there is nobody here to\r\ninduce such a one to stay for other reasons. That\xe2\x80\x99s right, that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nright\xe2\x80\x94go away!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut no, I have not actually bought the practice as yet, though I am\r\nindeed in treaty for it. And, my dear friend, if I continue to feel\r\nabout the business as I feel at this moment\xe2\x80\x94perhaps I may conclude\r\nnever to go at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you hate Hintock, and everybody and everything in it that you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t mean to take away with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFitzpiers contradicted this idea in his most vibratory tones, and she\r\nlapsed into the frivolous archness under which she hid passions of no\r\nmean strength\xe2\x80\x94strange, smouldering, erratic passions, kept down like a\r\nstifled conflagration, but bursting out now here, now there\xe2\x80\x94the only\r\ncertain element in their direction being its unexpectedness. If one\r\nword could have expressed her it would have been Inconsequence. She was\r\na woman of perversities, delighting in frequent contrasts. She liked\r\nmystery, in her life, in her love, in her history. To be fair to her,\r\nthere was nothing in the latter which she had any great reason to be\r\nashamed of, and many things of which she might have been proud; but it\r\nhad never been fathomed by the honest minds of Hintock, and she rarely\r\nvolunteered her experiences. As for her capricious nature, the people\r\non her estates grew accustomed to it, and with that marvellous subtlety\r\nof contrivance in steering round odd tempers, that is found in sons of\r\nthe soil and dependants generally, they managed to get along under her\r\ngovernment rather better than they would have done beneath a more\r\nequable rule.\r\n\r\nNow, with regard to the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s notion of leaving Hintock, he had\r\nadvanced further towards completing the purchase of the Budmouth\r\nsurgeon\xe2\x80\x99s good-will than he had admitted to Mrs. Charmond. The whole\r\nmatter hung upon what he might do in the ensuing twenty-four hours. The\r\nevening after leaving her he went out into the lane, and walked and\r\npondered between the high hedges, now greenish-white with wild\r\nclematis\xe2\x80\x94here called \xe2\x80\x9cold-man\xe2\x80\x99s beard,\xe2\x80\x9d from its aspect later in the\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nThe letter of acceptance was to be written that night, after which his\r\ndeparture from Hintock would be irrevocable. But could he go away,\r\nremembering what had just passed? The trees, the hills, the leaves, the\r\ngrass\xe2\x80\x94each had been endowed and quickened with a subtle charm since he\r\nhad discovered the person and history, and, above all, mood of their\r\nowner. There was every temporal reason for leaving; it would be\r\nentering again into a world which he had only quitted in a passion for\r\nisolation, induced by a fit of Achillean moodiness after an imagined\r\nslight. His wife herself saw the awkwardness of their position here,\r\nand cheerfully welcomed the purposed change, towards which every step\r\nhad been taken but the last. But could he find it in his heart\xe2\x80\x94as he\r\nfound it clearly enough in his conscience\xe2\x80\x94to go away?\r\n\r\nHe drew a troubled breath, and went in-doors. Here he rapidly penned a\r\nletter, wherein he withdrew once for all from the treaty for the\r\nBudmouth practice. As the postman had already left Little Hintock for\r\nthat night, he sent one of Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s men to intercept a mail-cart on\r\nanother turnpike-road, and so got the letter off.\r\n\r\nThe man returned, met Fitzpiers in the lane, and told him the thing was\r\ndone. Fitzpiers went back to his house musing. Why had he carried out\r\nthis impulse\xe2\x80\x94taken such wild trouble to effect a probable injury to his\r\nown and his young wife\xe2\x80\x99s prospects? His motive was fantastic, glowing,\r\nshapeless as the fiery scenery about the western sky. Mrs. Charmond\r\ncould overtly be nothing more to him than a patient now, and to his\r\nwife, at the outside, a patron. In the unattached bachelor days of his\r\nfirst sojourning here how highly proper an emotional reason for\r\nlingering on would have appeared to troublesome dubiousness.\r\nMatrimonial ambition is such an honorable thing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father has told me that you have sent off one of the men with a\r\nlate letter to Budmouth,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Grace, coming out vivaciously to meet\r\nhim under the declining light of the sky, wherein hung, solitary, the\r\nfolding star. \xe2\x80\x9cI said at once that you had finally agreed to pay the\r\npremium they ask, and that the tedious question had been settled. When\r\ndo we go, Edgar?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have altered my mind,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cThey want too much\xe2\x80\x94seven hundred\r\nand fifty is too large a sum\xe2\x80\x94and in short, I have declined to go\r\nfurther. We must wait for another opportunity. I fear I am not a good\r\nbusiness-man.\xe2\x80\x9d He spoke the last words with a momentary faltering at\r\nthe great foolishness of his act; for, as he looked in her fair and\r\nhonorable face, his heart reproached him for what he had done.\r\n\r\nHer manner that evening showed her disappointment. Personally she liked\r\nthe home of her childhood much, and she was not ambitious. But her\r\nhusband had seemed so dissatisfied with the circumstances hereabout\r\nsince their marriage that she had sincerely hoped to go for his sake.\r\n\r\nIt was two or three days before he visited Mrs. Charmond again. The\r\nmorning had been windy, and little showers had sowed themselves like\r\ngrain against the walls and window-panes of the Hintock cottages. He\r\nwent on foot across the wilder recesses of the park, where slimy\r\nstreams of green moisture, exuding from decayed holes caused by old\r\namputations, ran down the bark of the oaks and elms, the rind below\r\nbeing coated with a lichenous wash as green as emerald. They were\r\nstout-trunked trees, that never rocked their stems in the fiercest\r\ngale, responding to it entirely by crooking their limbs. Wrinkled like\r\nan old crone\xe2\x80\x99s face, and antlered with dead branches that rose above\r\nthe foliage of their summits, they were nevertheless still green\xe2\x80\x94though\r\nyellow had invaded the leaves of other trees.\r\n\r\nShe was in a little boudoir or writing-room on the first floor, and\r\nFitzpiers was much surprised to find that the window-curtains were\r\nclosed and a red-shaded lamp and candles burning, though out-of-doors\r\nit was broad daylight. Moreover, a large fire was burning in the grate,\r\nthough it was not cold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does it all mean?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\nShe sat in an easy-chair, her face being turned away. \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nmurmured, \xe2\x80\x9cit is because the world is so dreary outside. Sorrow and\r\nbitterness in the sky, and floods of agonized tears beating against the\r\npanes. I lay awake last night, and I could hear the scrape of snails\r\ncreeping up the window-glass; it was so sad! My eyes were so heavy this\r\nmorning that I could have wept my life away. I cannot bear you to see\r\nmy face; I keep it away from you purposely. Oh! why were we given\r\nhungry hearts and wild desires if we have to live in a world like this?\r\nWhy should Death only lend what Life is compelled to borrow\xe2\x80\x94rest?\r\nAnswer that, Dr. Fitzpiers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must eat of a second tree of knowledge before _you_ can do it,\r\nFelice Charmond.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, when my emotions have exhausted themselves, I become full of\r\nfears, till I think I shall die for very fear. The terrible\r\ninsistencies of society\xe2\x80\x94how severe they are, and cold and\r\ninexorable\xe2\x80\x94ghastly towards those who are made of wax and not of stone.\r\nOh, I am afraid of them; a stab for this error, and a stab for\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x94correctives and regulations framed that society may tend to\r\nperfection\xe2\x80\x94an end which I don\xe2\x80\x99t care for in the least. Yet for this,\r\nall I do care for has to be stunted and starved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFitzpiers had seated himself near her. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat sets you in this mournful\r\nmood?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, gently. (In reality he knew that it was the result of\r\na loss of tone from staying in-doors so much, but he did not say so.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy reflections. Doctor, you must not come here any more. They begin to\r\nthink it a farce already. I say you must come no more. There\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nangry with me;\xe2\x80\x9d and she jumped up, pressed his hand, and looked\r\nanxiously at him. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is necessary. It is best for both you and me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fitzpiers, gloomily, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat have we done?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDone\xe2\x80\x94we have done nothing. Perhaps we have thought the more. However,\r\nit is all vexation. I am going away to Middleton Abbey, near\r\nShottsford, where a relative of my late husband lives, who is confined\r\nto her bed. The engagement was made in London, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t get out of\r\nit. Perhaps it is for the best that I go there till all this is past.\r\nWhen are you going to enter on your new practice, and leave Hintock\r\nbehind forever, with your pretty wife on your arm?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have refused the opportunity. I love this place too well to depart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou _have?_\xe2\x80\x9d she said, regarding him with wild uncertainty. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy do\r\nyou ruin yourself in that way? Great Heaven, what have I done!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing. Besides, you are going away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes; but only to Middleton Abbey for a month or two. Yet perhaps I\r\nshall gain strength there\xe2\x80\x94particularly strength of mind\xe2\x80\x94I require it.\r\nAnd when I come back I shall be a new woman; and you can come and see\r\nme safely then, and bring your wife with you, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll be friends\xe2\x80\x94she\r\nand I. Oh, how this shutting up of one\xe2\x80\x99s self does lead to indulgence\r\nin idle sentiments. I shall not wish you to give your attendance to me\r\nafter to-day. But I am glad that you are not going away\xe2\x80\x94if your\r\nremaining does not injure your prospects at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs soon as he had left the room the mild friendliness she had preserved\r\nin her tone at parting, the playful sadness with which she had\r\nconversed with him, equally departed from her. She became as heavy as\r\nlead\xe2\x80\x94just as she had been before he arrived. Her whole being seemed to\r\ndissolve in a sad powerlessness to do anything, and the sense of it\r\nmade her lips tremulous and her closed eyes wet. His footsteps again\r\nstartled her, and she turned round.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI returned for a moment to tell you that the evening is going to be\r\nfine. The sun is shining; so do open your curtains and put out those\r\nlights. Shall I do it for you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease\xe2\x80\x94if you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe drew back the window-curtains, whereupon the red glow of the lamp\r\nand the two candle-flames became almost invisible with the flood of\r\nlate autumn sunlight that poured in. \xe2\x80\x9cShall I come round to you?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nasked, her back being towards him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I am crying, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to see you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stood a moment irresolute, and regretted that he had killed the\r\nrosy, passionate lamplight by opening the curtains and letting in\r\ngarish day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I am going,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, stretching one hand round to him, and\r\npatting her eyes with a handkerchief held in the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I write a line to you at\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no.\xe2\x80\x9d A gentle reasonableness came into her tone as she added, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nmust not be, you know. It won\xe2\x80\x99t do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well. Good-by.\xe2\x80\x9d The next moment he was gone.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, with listless adroitness, she encouraged the maid who\r\ndressed her for dinner to speak of Dr. Fitzpiers\xe2\x80\x99s marriage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Fitzpiers was once supposed to favor Mr. Winterborne,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nyoung woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why didn\xe2\x80\x99t she marry him?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Charmond.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause, you see, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, he lost his houses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLost his houses? How came he to do that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe houses were held on lives, and the lives dropped, and your agent\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t renew them, though it is said that Mr. Winterborne had a very\r\ngood claim. That\xe2\x80\x99s as I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard it, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, and it was through it that\r\nthe match was broke off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBeing just then distracted by a dozen emotions, Mrs. Charmond sunk into\r\na mood of dismal self-reproach. \xe2\x80\x9cIn refusing that poor man his\r\nreasonable request,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to herself, \xe2\x80\x9cI foredoomed my rejuvenated\r\ngirlhood\xe2\x80\x99s romance. Who would have thought such a business matter could\r\nhave nettled my own heart like this? Now for a winter of regrets and\r\nagonies and useless wishes, till I forget him in the spring. Oh! I am\r\nglad I am going away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe left her chamber and went down to dine with a sigh. On the stairs\r\nshe stood opposite the large window for a moment, and looked out upon\r\nthe lawn. It was not yet quite dark. Half-way up the steep green slope\r\nconfronting her stood old Timothy Tangs, who was shortening his way\r\nhomeward by clambering here where there was no road, and in opposition\r\nto express orders that no path was to be made there. Tangs had\r\nmomentarily stopped to take a pinch of snuff; but observing Mrs.\r\nCharmond gazing at him, he hastened to get over the top out of hail.\r\nHis precipitancy made him miss his footing, and he rolled like a barrel\r\nto the bottom, his snuffbox rolling in front of him.\r\n\r\nHer indefinite, idle, impossible passion for Fitzpiers; her\r\nconstitutional cloud of misery; the sorrowful drops that still hung\r\nupon her eyelashes, all made way for the incursive mood started by the\r\nspectacle. She burst into an immoderate fit of laughter, her very gloom\r\nof the previous hour seeming to render it the more uncontrollable. It\r\nhad not died out of her when she reached the dining-room; and even\r\nhere, before the servants, her shoulders suddenly shook as the scene\r\nreturned upon her; and the tears of her hilarity mingled with the\r\nremnants of those engendered by her grief.\r\n\r\nShe resolved to be sad no more. She drank two glasses of champagne, and\r\na little more still after those, and amused herself in the evening with\r\nsinging little amatory songs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must do something for that poor man Winterborne, however,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nA week had passed, and Mrs. Charmond had left Hintock House. Middleton\r\nAbbey, the place of her sojourn, was about twenty miles distant by\r\nroad, eighteen by bridle-paths and footways.\r\n\r\nGrace observed, for the first time, that her husband was restless, that\r\nat moments he even was disposed to avoid her. The scrupulous civility\r\nof mere acquaintanceship crept into his manner; yet, when sitting at\r\nmeals, he seemed hardly to hear her remarks. Her little doings\r\ninterested him no longer, while towards her father his bearing was not\r\nfar from supercilious. It was plain that his mind was entirely outside\r\nher life, whereabouts outside it she could not tell; in some region of\r\nscience, possibly, or of psychological literature. But her hope that he\r\nwas again immersing himself in those lucubrations which before her\r\nmarriage had made his light a landmark in Hintock, was founded simply\r\non the slender fact that he often sat up late.\r\n\r\nOne evening she discovered him leaning over a gate on Rub-Down Hill,\r\nthe gate at which Winterborne had once been standing, and which opened\r\non the brink of a steep, slanting down directly into Blackmoor Vale, or\r\nthe Vale of the White Hart, extending beneath the eye at this point to\r\na distance of many miles. His attention was fixed on the landscape far\r\naway, and Grace\xe2\x80\x99s approach was so noiseless that he did not hear her.\r\nWhen she came close she could see his lips moving unconsciously, as to\r\nsome impassioned visionary theme.\r\n\r\nShe spoke, and Fitzpiers started. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you looking at?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! I was contemplating our old place of Buckbury, in my idle way,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nIt had seemed to her that he was looking much to the right of that\r\ncradle and tomb of his ancestral dignity; but she made no further\r\nobservation, and taking his arm walked home beside him almost in\r\nsilence. She did not know that Middleton Abbey lay in the direction of\r\nhis gaze. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you going to have out Darling this afternoon?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nasked, presently. Darling being the light-gray mare which Winterborne\r\nhad bought for Grace, and which Fitzpiers now constantly used, the\r\nanimal having turned out a wonderful bargain, in combining a perfect\r\ndocility with an almost human intelligence; moreover, she was not too\r\nyoung. Fitzpiers was unfamiliar with horses, and he valued these\r\nqualities.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, \xe2\x80\x9cbut not to drive. I am riding her. I practise\r\ncrossing a horse as often as I can now, for I find that I can take much\r\nshorter cuts on horseback.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had, in fact, taken these riding exercises for about a week, only\r\nsince Mrs. Charmond\xe2\x80\x99s absence, his universal practice hitherto having\r\nbeen to drive.\r\n\r\nSome few days later, Fitzpiers started on the back of this horse to see\r\na patient in the aforesaid Vale. It was about five o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the\r\nevening when he went away, and at bedtime he had not reached home.\r\nThere was nothing very singular in this, though she was not aware that\r\nhe had any patient more than five or six miles distant in that\r\ndirection. The clock had struck one before Fitzpiers entered the house,\r\nand he came to his room softly, as if anxious not to disturb her.\r\n\r\nThe next morning she was stirring considerably earlier than he.\r\n\r\nIn the yard there was a conversation going on about the mare; the man\r\nwho attended to the horses, Darling included, insisted that the latter\r\nwas \xe2\x80\x9chag-rid;\xe2\x80\x9d for when he had arrived at the stable that morning she\r\nwas in such a state as no horse could be in by honest riding. It was\r\ntrue that the doctor had stabled her himself when he got home, so that\r\nshe was not looked after as she would have been if he had groomed and\r\nfed her; but that did not account for the appearance she presented, if\r\nMr. Fitzpiers\xe2\x80\x99s journey had been only where he had stated. The\r\nphenomenal exhaustion of Darling, as thus related, was sufficient to\r\ndevelop a whole series of tales about riding witches and demons, the\r\nnarration of which occupied a considerable time.\r\n\r\nGrace returned in-doors. In passing through the outer room she picked\r\nup her husband\xe2\x80\x99s overcoat which he had carelessly flung down across a\r\nchair. A turnpike ticket fell out of the breast-pocket, and she saw\r\nthat it had been issued at Middleton Gate. He had therefore visited\r\nMiddleton the previous night, a distance of at least five-and-thirty\r\nmiles on horseback, there and back.\r\n\r\nDuring the day she made some inquiries, and learned for the first time\r\nthat Mrs. Charmond was staying at Middleton Abbey. She could not resist\r\nan inference\xe2\x80\x94strange as that inference was.\r\n\r\nA few days later he prepared to start again, at the same time and in\r\nthe same direction. She knew that the state of the cottager who lived\r\nthat way was a mere pretext; she was quite sure he was going to Mrs.\r\nCharmond. Grace was amazed at the mildness of the passion which the\r\nsuspicion engendered in her. She was but little excited, and her\r\njealousy was languid even to death. It told tales of the nature of her\r\naffection for him. In truth, her antenuptial regard for Fitzpiers had\r\nbeen rather of the quality of awe towards a superior being than of\r\ntender solicitude for a lover. It had been based upon mystery and\r\nstrangeness\xe2\x80\x94the mystery of his past, of his knowledge, of his\r\nprofessional skill, of his beliefs. When this structure of ideals was\r\ndemolished by the intimacy of common life, and she found him as merely\r\nhuman as the Hintock people themselves, a new foundation was in demand\r\nfor an enduring and stanch affection\xe2\x80\x94a sympathetic interdependence,\r\nwherein mutual weaknesses were made the grounds of a defensive\r\nalliance. Fitzpiers had furnished none of that single-minded confidence\r\nand truth out of which alone such a second union could spring; hence it\r\nwas with a controllable emotion that she now watched the mare brought\r\nround.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll walk with you to the hill if you are not in a great hurry,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid, rather loath, after all, to let him go.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo; there\xe2\x80\x99s plenty of time,\xe2\x80\x9d replied her husband. Accordingly he led\r\nalong the horse, and walked beside her, impatient enough nevertheless.\r\nThus they proceeded to the turnpike road, and ascended Rub-Down Hill to\r\nthe gate he had been leaning over when she surprised him ten days\r\nbefore. This was the end of her excursion. Fitzpiers bade her adieu\r\nwith affection, even with tenderness, and she observed that he looked\r\nweary-eyed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you go to-night?\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have been called up two nights\r\nin succession already.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must go,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, almost gloomily. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t wait up for me.\xe2\x80\x9d With\r\nthese words he mounted his horse, passed through the gate which Grace\r\nheld open for him, and ambled down the steep bridle-track to the\r\nvalley.\r\n\r\nShe closed the gate and watched his descent, and then his journey\r\nonward. His way was east, the evening sun which stood behind her back\r\nbeaming full upon him as soon as he got out from the shade of the hill.\r\nNotwithstanding this untoward proceeding she was determined to be loyal\r\nif he proved true; and the determination to love one\xe2\x80\x99s best will carry\r\na heart a long way towards making that best an ever-growing thing. The\r\nconspicuous coat of the active though blanching mare made horse and\r\nrider easy objects for the vision. Though Darling had been chosen with\r\nsuch pains by Winterborne for Grace, she had never ridden the sleek\r\ncreature; but her husband had found the animal exceedingly convenient,\r\nparticularly now that he had taken to the saddle, plenty of staying\r\npower being left in Darling yet. Fitzpiers, like others of his\r\ncharacter, while despising Melbury and his station, did not at all\r\ndisdain to spend Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s money, or appropriate to his own use the\r\nhorse which belonged to Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s daughter.\r\n\r\nAnd so the infatuated young surgeon went along through the gorgeous\r\nautumn landscape of White Hart Vale, surrounded by orchards lustrous\r\nwith the reds of apple-crops, berries, and foliage, the whole\r\nintensified by the gilding of the declining sun. The earth this year\r\nhad been prodigally bountiful, and now was the supreme moment of her\r\nbounty. In the poorest spots the hedges were bowed with haws and\r\nblackberries; acorns cracked underfoot, and the burst husks of\r\nchestnuts lay exposing their auburn contents as if arranged by anxious\r\nsellers in a fruit-market. In all this proud show some kernels were\r\nunsound as her own situation, and she wondered if there were one world\r\nin the universe where the fruit had no worm, and marriage no sorrow.\r\n\r\nHerr Tannh\xc3\xa4user still moved on, his plodding steed rendering him\r\ndistinctly visible yet. Could she have heard Fitzpiers\xe2\x80\x99s voice at that\r\nmoment she would have found him murmuring\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c...Towards the loadstar of my one desire\r\nI flitted, even as a dizzy moth in the owlet light.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nBut he was a silent spectacle to her now. Soon he rose out of the\r\nvalley, and skirted a high plateau of the chalk formation on his right,\r\nwhich rested abruptly upon the fruity district of loamy clay, the\r\ncharacter and herbage of the two formations being so distinct that the\r\ncalcareous upland appeared but as a deposit of a few years\xe2\x80\x99 antiquity\r\nupon the level vale. He kept along the edge of this high, unenclosed\r\ncountry, and the sky behind him being deep violet, she could still see\r\nwhite Darling in relief upon it\xe2\x80\x94a mere speck now\xe2\x80\x94a Wouvermans\r\neccentricity reduced to microscopic dimensions. Upon this high ground\r\nhe gradually disappeared.\r\n\r\nThus she had beheld the pet animal purchased for her own use, in pure\r\nlove of her, by one who had always been true, impressed to convey her\r\nhusband away from her to the side of a new-found idol. While she was\r\nmusing on the vicissitudes of horses and wives, she discerned shapes\r\nmoving up the valley towards her, quite near at hand, though till now\r\nhidden by the hedges. Surely they were Giles Winterborne, with his two\r\nhorses and cider-apparatus, conducted by Robert Creedle. Up, upward\r\nthey crept, a stray beam of the sun alighting every now and then like a\r\nstar on the blades of the pomace-shovels, which had been converted to\r\nsteel mirrors by the action of the malic acid. She opened the gate when\r\nhe came close, and the panting horses rested as they achieved the\r\nascent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you do, Giles?\xe2\x80\x9d said she, under a sudden impulse to be familiar\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\nHe replied with much more reserve. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are going for a walk, Mrs.\r\nFitzpiers?\xe2\x80\x9d he added. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is pleasant just now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I am returning,\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\nThe vehicles passed through, the gate slammed, and Winterborne walked\r\nby her side in the rear of the apple-mill.\r\n\r\nHe looked and smelt like Autumn\xe2\x80\x99s very brother, his face being sunburnt\r\nto wheat-color, his eyes blue as corn-flowers, his boots and leggings\r\ndyed with fruit-stains, his hands clammy with the sweet juice of\r\napples, his hat sprinkled with pips, and everywhere about him that\r\natmosphere of cider which at its first return each season has such an\r\nindescribable fascination for those who have been born and bred among\r\nthe orchards. Her heart rose from its late sadness like a released\r\nspring; her senses revelled in the sudden lapse back to nature\r\nunadorned. The consciousness of having to be genteel because of her\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s profession, the veneer of artificiality which she had\r\nacquired at the fashionable schools, were thrown off, and she became\r\nthe crude, country girl of her latent, earliest instincts.\r\n\r\nNature was bountiful, she thought. No sooner had she been starved off\r\nby Edgar Fitzpiers than another being, impersonating bare and undiluted\r\nmanliness, had arisen out of the earth, ready to hand. This was an\r\nexcursion of the imagination which she did not encourage, and she said\r\nsuddenly, to disguise the confused regard which had followed her\r\nthoughts, \xe2\x80\x9cDid you meet my husband?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWinterborne, with some hesitation, \xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere did you meet him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt Calfhay Cross. I come from Middleton Abbey; I have been making\r\nthere for the last week.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t they a mill of their own?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but it\xe2\x80\x99s out of repair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think\xe2\x80\x94I heard that Mrs. Charmond had gone there to stay?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I have seen her at the windows once or twice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrace waited an interval before she went on: \xe2\x80\x9cDid Mr. Fitzpiers take\r\nthe way to Middleton?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes...I met him on Darling.\xe2\x80\x9d As she did not reply, he added, with a\r\ngentler inflection, \xe2\x80\x9cYou know why the mare was called that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes\xe2\x80\x94of course,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, quickly.\r\n\r\nThey had risen so far over the crest of the hill that the whole west\r\nsky was revealed. Between the broken clouds they could see far into the\r\nrecesses of heaven, the eye journeying on under a species of golden\r\narcades, and past fiery obstructions, fancied cairns, logan-stones,\r\nstalactites and stalagmite of topaz. Deeper than this their gaze passed\r\nthin flakes of incandescence, till it plunged into a bottomless medium\r\nof soft green fire.\r\n\r\nHer abandonment to the luscious time after her sense of ill-usage, her\r\nrevolt for the nonce against social law, her passionate desire for\r\nprimitive life, may have showed in her face. Winterborne was looking at\r\nher, his eyes lingering on a flower that she wore in her bosom. Almost\r\nwith the abstraction of a somnambulist he stretched out his hand and\r\ngently caressed the flower.\r\n\r\nShe drew back. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing, Giles Winterborne!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed,\r\nwith a look of severe surprise. The evident absence of all\r\npremeditation from the act, however, speedily led her to think that it\r\nwas not necessary to stand upon her dignity here and now. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must\r\nbear in mind, Giles,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, kindly, \xe2\x80\x9cthat we are not as we were;\r\nand some people might have said that what you did was taking a\r\nliberty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was more than she need have told him; his action of forgetfulness\r\nhad made him so angry with himself that he flushed through his tan. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know what I am coming to!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, savagely. \xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\x94I was not\r\nonce like this!\xe2\x80\x9d Tears of vexation were in his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, now\xe2\x80\x94it was nothing. I was too reproachful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would not have occurred to me if I had not seen something like it\r\ndone elsewhere\xe2\x80\x94at Middleton lately,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, thoughtfully, after a\r\nwhile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy whom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t ask it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe scanned him narrowly. \xe2\x80\x9cI know quite well enough,\xe2\x80\x9d she returned,\r\nindifferently. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was by my husband, and the woman was Mrs. Charmond.\r\nAssociation of ideas reminded you when you saw me....Giles\xe2\x80\x94tell me all\r\nyou know about that\xe2\x80\x94please do, Giles! But no\xe2\x80\x94I won\xe2\x80\x99t hear it. Let the\r\nsubject cease. And as you are my friend, say nothing to my father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey reached a place where their ways divided. Winterborne continued\r\nalong the highway which kept outside the copse, and Grace opened a gate\r\nthat entered it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nShe walked up the soft grassy ride, screened on either hand by\r\nnut-bushes, just now heavy with clusters of twos and threes and fours.\r\nA little way on, the track she pursued was crossed by a similar one at\r\nright angles. Here Grace stopped; some few yards up the transverse ride\r\nthe buxom Suke Damson was visible\xe2\x80\x94her gown tucked up high through her\r\npocket-hole, and no bonnet on her head\xe2\x80\x94in the act of pulling down\r\nboughs from which she was gathering and eating nuts with great\r\nrapidity, her lover Tim Tangs standing near her engaged in the same\r\npleasant meal.\r\n\r\nCrack, crack went Suke\xe2\x80\x99s jaws every second or two. By an automatic\r\nchain of thought Grace\xe2\x80\x99s mind reverted to the tooth-drawing scene\r\ndescribed by her husband; and for the first time she wondered if that\r\nnarrative were really true, Susan\xe2\x80\x99s jaws being so obviously sound and\r\nstrong. Grace turned up towards the nut-gatherers, and conquered her\r\nreluctance to speak to the girl who was a little in advance of Tim.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-evening, Susan,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-evening, Miss Melbury\xe2\x80\x9d (crack).\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Fitzpiers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am\xe2\x80\x94Mrs. Fitzpiers,\xe2\x80\x9d said Suke, with a peculiar smile.\r\n\r\nGrace, not to be daunted, continued: \xe2\x80\x9cTake care of your teeth, Suke.\r\nThat accounts for the toothache.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what an ache is, either in tooth, ear, or head, thank the\r\nLord\xe2\x80\x9d (crack).\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor the loss of one, either?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee for yourself, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d She parted her red lips, and exhibited the\r\nwhole double row, full up and unimpaired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have never had one drawn?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo much the better for your stomach,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Fitzpiers, in an\r\naltered voice. And turning away quickly, she went on.\r\n\r\nAs her husband\xe2\x80\x99s character thus shaped itself under the touch of time,\r\nGrace was almost startled to find how little she suffered from that\r\njealous excitement which is conventionally attributed to all wives in\r\nsuch circumstances. But though possessed by none of that feline\r\nwildness which it was her moral duty to experience, she did not fail to\r\nknow that she had made a frightful mistake in her marriage.\r\nAcquiescence in her father\xe2\x80\x99s wishes had been degradation to herself.\r\nPeople are not given premonitions for nothing; she should have obeyed\r\nher impulse on that early morning, and steadfastly refused her hand.\r\n\r\nOh, that plausible tale which her then betrothed had told her about\r\nSuke\xe2\x80\x94the dramatic account of her entreaties to him to draw the aching\r\nenemy, and the fine artistic touch he had given to the story by\r\nexplaining that it was a lovely molar without a flaw!\r\n\r\nShe traced the remainder of the woodland track dazed by the\r\ncomplications of her position. If his protestations to her before their\r\nmarriage could be believed, her husband had felt affection of some sort\r\nfor herself and this woman simultaneously; and was now again spreading\r\nthe same emotion over Mrs. Charmond and herself conjointly, his manner\r\nbeing still kind and fond at times. But surely, rather than that, he\r\nmust have played the hypocrite towards her in each case with elaborate\r\ncompleteness; and the thought of this sickened her, for it involved the\r\nconjecture that if he had not loved her, his only motive for making her\r\nhis wife must have been her little fortune. Yet here Grace made a\r\nmistake, for the love of men like Fitzpiers is unquestionably of such\r\nquality as to bear division and transference. He had indeed, once\r\ndeclared, though not to her, that on one occasion he had noticed\r\nhimself to be possessed by five distinct infatuations at the same time.\r\nTherein it differed from the highest affection as the lower orders of\r\nthe animal world differ from advanced organisms, partition causing, not\r\ndeath, but a multiplied existence. He had loved her sincerely, and had\r\nby no means ceased to love her now. But such double and treble\r\nbarrelled hearts were naturally beyond her conception.\r\n\r\nOf poor Suke Damson, Grace thought no more. She had had her day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf he does not love me I will not love him!\xe2\x80\x9d said Grace, proudly. And\r\nthough these were mere words, it was a somewhat formidable thing for\r\nFitzpiers that her heart was approximating to a state in which it might\r\nbe possible to carry them out. That very absence of hot jealousy which\r\nmade his courses so easy, and on which, indeed, he congratulated\r\nhimself, meant, unknown to either wife or husband, more mischief than\r\nthe inconvenient watchfulness of a jaundiced eye.\r\n\r\nHer sleep that night was nervous. The wing allotted to her and her\r\nhusband had never seemed so lonely. At last she got up, put on her\r\ndressing-gown, and went down-stairs. Her father, who slept lightly,\r\nheard her descend, and came to the stair-head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that you, Grace? What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing more than that I am restless. Edgar is detained by a case at\r\nOwlscombe in White Hart Vale.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how\xe2\x80\x99s that? I saw the woman\xe2\x80\x99s husband at Great Hintock just afore\r\nbedtime; and she was going on well, and the doctor gone then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen he\xe2\x80\x99s detained somewhere else,\xe2\x80\x9d said Grace. \xe2\x80\x9cNever mind me; he\r\nwill soon be home. I expect him about one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe went back to her room, and dozed and woke several times. One\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock had been the hour of his return on the last occasion; but it\r\npassed now by a long way, and Fitzpiers did not come. Just before dawn\r\nshe heard the men stirring in the yard; and the flashes of their\r\nlanterns spread every now and then through her window-blind. She\r\nremembered that her father had told her not to be disturbed if she\r\nnoticed them, as they would be rising early to send off four loads of\r\nhurdles to a distant sheep-fair. Peeping out, she saw them bustling\r\nabout, the hollow-turner among the rest; he was loading his\r\nwares\xe2\x80\x94wooden-bowls, dishes, spigots, spoons, cheese-vats, funnels, and\r\nso on\xe2\x80\x94upon one of her father\xe2\x80\x99s wagons, who carried them to the fair for\r\nhim every year out of neighborly kindness.\r\n\r\nThe scene and the occasion would have enlivened her but that her\r\nhusband was still absent; though it was now five o\xe2\x80\x99clock. She could\r\nhardly suppose him, whatever his infatuation, to have prolonged to a\r\nlater hour than ten an ostensibly professional call on Mrs. Charmond at\r\nMiddleton; and he could have ridden home in two hours and a half. What,\r\nthen, had become of him? That he had been out the greater part of the\r\ntwo preceding nights added to her uneasiness.\r\n\r\nShe dressed herself, descended, and went out, the weird twilight of\r\nadvancing day chilling the rays from the lanterns, and making the men\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfaces wan. As soon as Melbury saw her he came round, showing his alarm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEdgar is not come,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I have reason to know that he\xe2\x80\x99s not\r\nattending anybody. He has had no rest for two nights before this. I was\r\ngoing to the top of the hill to look for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll come with you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Melbury.\r\n\r\nShe begged him not to hinder himself; but he insisted, for he saw a\r\npeculiar and rigid gloom in her face over and above her uneasiness, and\r\ndid not like the look of it. Telling the men he would be with them\r\nagain soon, he walked beside her into the turnpike-road, and partly up\r\nthe hill whence she had watched Fitzpiers the night before across the\r\nGreat White Hart or Blackmoor Valley. They halted beneath a half-dead\r\noak, hollow, and disfigured with white tumors, its roots spreading out\r\nlike accipitrine claws grasping the ground. A chilly wind circled round\r\nthem, upon whose currents the seeds of a neighboring lime-tree,\r\nsupported parachute-wise by the wing attached, flew out of the boughs\r\ndownward like fledglings from their nest. The vale was wrapped in a dim\r\natmosphere of unnaturalness, and the east was like a livid curtain\r\nedged with pink. There was no sign nor sound of Fitzpiers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is no use standing here,\xe2\x80\x9d said her father. \xe2\x80\x9cHe may come home fifty\r\nways...why, look here!\xe2\x80\x94here be Darling\xe2\x80\x99s tracks\xe2\x80\x94turned homeward and\r\nnearly blown dry and hard! He must have come in hours ago without your\r\nseeing him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has not done that,\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\nThey went back hastily. On entering their own gates they perceived that\r\nthe men had left the wagons, and were standing round the door of the\r\nstable which had been appropriated to the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s use. \xe2\x80\x9cIs there\r\nanything the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Grace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. All\xe2\x80\x99s well that ends well,\xe2\x80\x9d said old Timothy Tangs.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve heard of such things before\xe2\x80\x94among workfolk, though not among your\r\ngentle people\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s true.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey entered the stable, and saw the pale shape of Darling standing in\r\nthe middle of her stall, with Fitzpiers on her back, sound asleep.\r\nDarling was munching hay as well as she could with the bit in her\r\nmonth, and the reins, which had fallen from Fitzpiers\xe2\x80\x99s hand, hung upon\r\nher neck.\r\n\r\nGrace went and touched his hand; shook it before she could arouse him.\r\nHe moved, started, opened his eyes, and exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cAh, Felice!...Oh,\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s Grace. I could not see in the gloom. What\xe2\x80\x94am I in the saddle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cHow do you come here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe collected his thoughts, and in a few minutes stammered, \xe2\x80\x9cI was\r\nriding along homeward through the vale, very, very sleepy, having been\r\nup so much of late. When I came opposite Holywell spring the mare\r\nturned her head that way, as if she wanted to drink. I let her go in,\r\nand she drank; I thought she would never finish. While she was\r\ndrinking, the clock of Owlscombe Church struck twelve. I distinctly\r\nremember counting the strokes. From that moment I positively recollect\r\nnothing till I saw you here by my side.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe name! If it had been any other horse he\xe2\x80\x99d have had a broken neck!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nmurmured Melbury.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis wonderful, sure, how a quiet hoss will bring a man home at such\r\ntimes!\xe2\x80\x9d said John Upjohn. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what\xe2\x80\x99s more wonderful than keeping your\r\nseat in a deep, slumbering sleep? I\xe2\x80\x99ve knowed men drowze off walking\r\nhome from randies where the mead and other liquors have gone round\r\nwell, and keep walking for more than a mile on end without waking.\r\nWell, doctor, I don\xe2\x80\x99t care who the man is, \xe2\x80\x99tis a mercy you wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a\r\ndrownded, or a splintered, or a hanged up to a tree like Absalom\xe2\x80\x94also a\r\nhandsome gentleman like yerself, as the prophets say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured old Timothy. \xe2\x80\x9cFrom the soul of his foot to the crown\r\nof his head there was no blemish in him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr leastwise you might ha\xe2\x80\x99 been a-wownded into tatters a\xe2\x80\x99most, and no\r\ndoctor to jine your few limbs together within seven mile!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile this grim address was proceeding, Fitzpiers had dismounted, and\r\ntaking Grace\xe2\x80\x99s arm walked stiffly in-doors with her. Melbury stood\r\nstaring at the horse, which, in addition to being very weary, was\r\nspattered with mud. There was no mud to speak of about the Hintocks\r\njust now\xe2\x80\x94only in the clammy hollows of the vale beyond Owlscombe, the\r\nstiff soil of which retained moisture for weeks after the uplands were\r\ndry. While they were rubbing down the mare, Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s mind coupled with\r\nthe foreign quality of the mud the name he had heard unconsciously\r\nmuttered by the surgeon when Grace took his hand\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cFelice.\xe2\x80\x9d Who was\r\nFelice? Why, Mrs. Charmond; and she, as he knew, was staying at\r\nMiddleton.\r\n\r\nMelbury had indeed pounced upon the image that filled Fitzpiers\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhalf-awakened soul\xe2\x80\x94wherein there had been a picture of a recent\r\ninterview on a lawn with a capriciously passionate woman who had begged\r\nhim not to come again in tones whose vibration incited him to disobey.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing here? Why do you pursue me? Another belongs to you.\r\nIf they were to see you they would seize you as a thief!\xe2\x80\x9d And she had\r\nturbulently admitted to his wringing questions that her visit to\r\nMiddleton had been undertaken less because of the invalid relative than\r\nin shamefaced fear of her own weakness if she remained near his home. A\r\ntriumph then it was to Fitzpiers, poor and hampered as he had become,\r\nto recognize his real conquest of this beauty, delayed so many years.\r\nHis was the selfish passion of Congreve\xe2\x80\x99s Millamont, to whom love\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsupreme delight lay in \xe2\x80\x9cthat heart which others bleed for, bleed for\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen the horse had been attended to Melbury stood uneasily here and\r\nthere about his premises; he was rudely disturbed in the comfortable\r\nviews which had lately possessed him on his domestic concerns. It is\r\ntrue that he had for some days discerned that Grace more and more\r\nsought his company, preferred supervising his kitchen and bakehouse\r\nwith her step-mother to occupying herself with the lighter details of\r\nher own apartments. She seemed no longer able to find in her own hearth\r\nan adequate focus for her life, and hence, like a weak queen-bee after\r\nleading off to an independent home, had hovered again into the parent\r\nhive. But he had not construed these and other incidents of the kind\r\ntill now.\r\n\r\nSomething was wrong in the dove-cot. A ghastly sense that he alone\r\nwould be responsible for whatever unhappiness should be brought upon\r\nher for whom he almost solely lived, whom to retain under his roof he\r\nhad faced the numerous inconveniences involved in giving up the best\r\npart of his house to Fitzpiers. There was no room for doubt that, had\r\nhe allowed events to take their natural course, she would have accepted\r\nWinterborne, and realized his old dream of restitution to that young\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s family.\r\n\r\nThat Fitzpiers could allow himself to look on any other creature for a\r\nmoment than Grace filled Melbury with grief and astonishment. In the\r\npure and simple life he had led it had scarcely occurred to him that\r\nafter marriage a man might be faithless. That he could sweep to the\r\nheights of Mrs. Charmond\xe2\x80\x99s position, lift the veil of Isis, so to\r\nspeak, would have amazed Melbury by its audacity if he had not\r\nsuspected encouragement from that quarter. What could he and his simple\r\nGrace do to countervail the passions of such as those two sophisticated\r\nbeings\xe2\x80\x94versed in the world\xe2\x80\x99s ways, armed with every apparatus for\r\nvictory? In such an encounter the homely timber-dealer felt as inferior\r\nas a bow-and-arrow savage before the precise weapons of modern warfare.\r\n\r\nGrace came out of the house as the morning drew on. The village was\r\nsilent, most of the folk having gone to the fair. Fitzpiers had retired\r\nto bed, and was sleeping off his fatigue. She went to the stable and\r\nlooked at poor Darling: in all probability Giles Winterborne, by\r\nobtaining for her a horse of such intelligence and docility, had been\r\nthe means of saving her husband\xe2\x80\x99s life. She paused over the strange\r\nthought; and then there appeared her father behind her. She saw that he\r\nknew things were not as they ought to be, from the troubled dulness of\r\nhis eye, and from his face, different points of which had independent\r\nmotions, twitchings, and tremblings, unknown to himself, and\r\ninvoluntary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was detained, I suppose, last night?\xe2\x80\x9d said Melbury.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes; a bad case in the vale,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, calmly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNevertheless, he should have stayed at home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t, father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer father turned away. He could hardly bear to see his whilom truthful\r\ngirl brought to the humiliation of having to talk like that.\r\n\r\nThat night carking care sat beside Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s pillow, and his stiff\r\nlimbs tossed at its presence. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t lie here any longer,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nmuttered. Striking a light, he wandered about the room. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat have I\r\ndone\xe2\x80\x94what have I done for her?\xe2\x80\x9d he said to his wife, who had anxiously\r\nawakened. \xe2\x80\x9cI had long planned that she should marry the son of the man\r\nI wanted to make amends to; do ye mind how I told you all about it,\r\nLucy, the night before she came home? Ah! but I was not content with\r\ndoing right, I wanted to do more!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t raft yourself without good need, George,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied. \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nquite believe that things are so much amiss. I won\xe2\x80\x99t believe that Mrs.\r\nCharmond has encouraged him. Even supposing she has encouraged a great\r\nmany, she can have no motive to do it now. What so likely as that she\r\nis not yet quite well, and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care to let another doctor come near\r\nher?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe did not heed. \xe2\x80\x9cGrace used to be so busy every day, with fixing a\r\ncurtain here and driving a tin-tack there; but she cares for no\r\nemployment now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know anything of Mrs. Charmond\xe2\x80\x99s past history? Perhaps that\r\nwould throw some light upon things. Before she came here as the wife of\r\nold Charmond four or five years ago, not a soul seems to have heard\r\naught of her. Why not make inquiries? And then do ye wait and see more;\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99ll be plenty of opportunity. Time enough to cry when you know\r\n\xe2\x80\x99tis a crying matter; and \xe2\x80\x99tis bad to meet troubles half-way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was some good-sense in the notion of seeing further. Melbury\r\nresolved to inquire and wait, hoping still, but oppressed\r\nbetween-whiles with much fear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\n\r\nExamine Grace as her father might, she would admit nothing. For the\r\npresent, therefore, he simply watched.\r\n\r\nThe suspicion that his darling child was being slighted wrought almost\r\na miraculous change in Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s nature. No man so furtive for the time\r\nas the ingenuous countryman who finds that his ingenuousness has been\r\nabused. Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s heretofore confidential candor towards his\r\ngentlemanly son-in-law was displaced by a feline stealth that did\r\ninjury to his every action, thought, and mood. He knew that a woman\r\nonce given to a man for life took, as a rule, her lot as it came and\r\nmade the best of it, without external interference; but for the first\r\ntime he asked himself why this so generally should be so. Moreover,\r\nthis case was not, he argued, like ordinary cases. Leaving out the\r\nquestion of Grace being anything but an ordinary woman, her peculiar\r\nsituation, as it were in mid-air between two planes of society,\r\ntogether with the loneliness of Hintock, made a husband\xe2\x80\x99s neglect a far\r\nmore tragical matter to her than it would be to one who had a large\r\ncircle of friends to fall back upon. Wisely or unwisely, and whatever\r\nother fathers did, he resolved to fight his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s battle still.\r\n\r\nMrs. Charmond had returned. But Hintock House scarcely gave forth signs\r\nof life, so quietly had she reentered it. He went to church at Great\r\nHintock one afternoon as usual, there being no service at the smaller\r\nvillage. A few minutes before his departure, he had casually heard\r\nFitzpiers, who was no church-goer, tell his wife that he was going to\r\nwalk in the wood. Melbury entered the building and sat down in his pew;\r\nthe parson came in, then Mrs. Charmond, then Mr. Fitzpiers.\r\n\r\nThe service proceeded, and the jealous father was quite sure that a\r\nmutual consciousness was uninterruptedly maintained between those two;\r\nhe fancied that more than once their eyes met. At the end, Fitzpiers so\r\ntimed his movement into the aisle that it exactly coincided with Felice\r\nCharmond\xe2\x80\x99s from the opposite side, and they walked out with their\r\ngarments in contact, the surgeon being just that two or three inches in\r\nher rear which made it convenient for his eyes to rest upon her cheek.\r\nThe cheek warmed up to a richer tone.\r\n\r\nThis was a worse feature in the flirtation than he had expected. If she\r\nhad been playing with him in an idle freak the game might soon have\r\nwearied her; but the smallest germ of passion\xe2\x80\x94and women of the world do\r\nnot change color for nothing\xe2\x80\x94was a threatening development. The mere\r\npresence of Fitzpiers in the building, after his statement, was\r\nwellnigh conclusive as far as he was concerned; but Melbury resolved\r\nyet to watch.\r\n\r\nHe had to wait long. Autumn drew shiveringly to its end. One day\r\nsomething seemed to be gone from the gardens; the tenderer leaves of\r\nvegetables had shrunk under the first smart frost, and hung like faded\r\nlinen rags; then the forest leaves, which had been descending at\r\nleisure, descended in haste and in multitudes, and all the golden\r\ncolors that had hung overhead were now crowded together in a degraded\r\nmass underfoot, where the fallen myriads got redder and hornier, and\r\ncurled themselves up to rot. The only suspicious features in Mrs.\r\nCharmond\xe2\x80\x99s existence at this season were two: the first, that she lived\r\nwith no companion or relative about her, which, considering her age and\r\nattractions, was somewhat unusual conduct for a young widow in a lonely\r\ncountry-house; the other, that she did not, as in previous years, start\r\nfrom Hintock to winter abroad. In Fitzpiers, the only change from his\r\nlast autumn\xe2\x80\x99s habits lay in his abandonment of night study\xe2\x80\x94his lamp\r\nnever shone from his new dwelling as from his old.\r\n\r\nIf the suspected ones met, it was by such adroit contrivances that even\r\nMelbury\xe2\x80\x99s vigilance could not encounter them together. A simple call at\r\nher house by the doctor had nothing irregular about it, and that he had\r\npaid two or three such calls was certain. What had passed at those\r\ninterviews was known only to the parties themselves; but that Felice\r\nCharmond was under some one\xe2\x80\x99s influence Melbury soon had opportunity of\r\nperceiving.\r\n\r\nWinter had come on. Owls began to be noisy in the mornings and\r\nevenings, and flocks of wood-pigeons made themselves prominent again.\r\nOne day in February, about six months after the marriage of Fitzpiers,\r\nMelbury was returning from Great Hintock on foot through the lane, when\r\nhe saw before him the surgeon also walking. Melbury would have\r\novertaken him, but at that moment Fitzpiers turned in through a gate to\r\none of the rambling drives among the trees at this side of the wood,\r\nwhich led to nowhere in particular, and the beauty of whose serpentine\r\ncurves was the only justification of their existence. Felice almost\r\nsimultaneously trotted down the lane towards the timber-dealer, in a\r\nlittle basket-carriage which she sometimes drove about the estate,\r\nunaccompanied by a servant. She turned in at the same place without\r\nhaving seen either Melbury or apparently Fitzpiers. Melbury was soon at\r\nthe spot, despite his aches and his sixty years. Mrs. Charmond had come\r\nup with the doctor, who was standing immediately behind the carriage.\r\nShe had turned to him, her arm being thrown carelessly over the back of\r\nthe seat. They looked in each other\xe2\x80\x99s faces without uttering a word, an\r\narch yet gloomy smile wreathing her lips. Fitzpiers clasped her hanging\r\nhand, and, while she still remained in the same listless attitude,\r\nlooking volumes into his eyes, he stealthily unbuttoned her glove, and\r\nstripped her hand of it by rolling back the gauntlet over the fingers,\r\nso that it came off inside out. He then raised her hand to his month,\r\nshe still reclining passively, watching him as she might have watched a\r\nfly upon her dress. At last she said, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, sir, what excuse for this\r\ndisobedience?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI make none.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen go your way, and let me go mine.\xe2\x80\x9d She snatched away her hand,\r\ntouched the pony with the whip, and left him standing there, holding\r\nthe reversed glove.\r\n\r\nMelbury\xe2\x80\x99s first impulse was to reveal his presence to Fitzpiers, and\r\nupbraid him bitterly. But a moment\xe2\x80\x99s thought was sufficient to show him\r\nthe futility of any such simple proceeding. There was not, after all,\r\nso much in what he had witnessed as in what that scene might be the\r\nsurface and froth of\xe2\x80\x94probably a state of mind on which censure operates\r\nas an aggravation rather than as a cure. Moreover, he said to himself\r\nthat the point of attack should be the woman, if either. He therefore\r\nkept out of sight, and musing sadly, even tearfully\xe2\x80\x94for he was meek as\r\na child in matters concerning his daughter\xe2\x80\x94continued his way towards\r\nHintock.\r\n\r\nThe insight which is bred of deep sympathy was never more finely\r\nexemplified than in this instance. Through her guarded manner, her\r\ndignified speech, her placid countenance, he discerned the interior of\r\nGrace\xe2\x80\x99s life only too truly, hidden as were its incidents from every\r\nouter eye.\r\n\r\nThese incidents had become painful enough. Fitzpiers had latterly\r\ndeveloped an irritable discontent which vented itself in monologues\r\nwhen Grace was present to hear them. The early morning of this day had\r\nbeen dull, after a night of wind, and on looking out of the window\r\nFitzpiers had observed some of Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s men dragging away a large limb\r\nwhich had been snapped off a beech-tree. Everything was cold and\r\ncolorless.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy good Heaven!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as he stood in his dressing-gown. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is\r\nlife!\xe2\x80\x9d He did not know whether Grace was awake or not, and he would not\r\nturn his head to ascertain. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, fool,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cto clip\r\nyour own wings when you were free to soar!...But I could not rest till\r\nI had done it. Why do I never recognize an opportunity till I have\r\nmissed it, nor the good or ill of a step till it is irrevocable!...I\r\nfell in love....Love, indeed!\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Love\xe2\x80\x99s but the frailty of the mind\r\nWhen \xe2\x80\x99tis not with ambition joined;\r\nA sickly flame which if not fed, expires,\r\nAnd feeding, wastes in self-consuming fires!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\nAh, old author of \xe2\x80\x98The Way of the World,\xe2\x80\x99 you knew\xe2\x80\x94you knew!\xe2\x80\x9d Grace\r\nmoved. He thought she had heard some part of his soliloquy. He was\r\nsorry\xe2\x80\x94though he had not taken any precaution to prevent her.\r\n\r\nHe expected a scene at breakfast, but she only exhibited an extreme\r\nreserve. It was enough, however, to make him repent that he should have\r\ndone anything to produce discomfort; for he attributed her manner\r\nentirely to what he had said. But Grace\xe2\x80\x99s manner had not its cause\r\neither in his sayings or in his doings. She had not heard a single word\r\nof his regrets. Something even nearer home than her husband\xe2\x80\x99s blighted\r\nprospects\xe2\x80\x94if blighted they were\xe2\x80\x94was the origin of her mood, a mood that\r\nwas the mere continuation of what her father had noticed when he would\r\nhave preferred a passionate jealousy in her, as the more natural.\r\n\r\nShe had made a discovery\xe2\x80\x94one which to a girl of honest nature was\r\nalmost appalling. She had looked into her heart, and found that her\r\nearly interest in Giles Winterborne had become revitalized into\r\nluxuriant growth by her widening perceptions of what was great and\r\nlittle in life. His homeliness no longer offended her acquired tastes;\r\nhis comparative want of so-called culture did not now jar on her\r\nintellect; his country dress even pleased her eye; his exterior\r\nroughness fascinated her. Having discovered by marriage how much that\r\nwas humanly not great could co-exist with attainments of an exceptional\r\norder, there was a revulsion in her sentiments from all that she had\r\nformerly clung to in this kind: honesty, goodness, manliness,\r\ntenderness, devotion, for her only existed in their purity now in the\r\nbreasts of unvarnished men; and here was one who had manifested them\r\ntowards her from his youth up.\r\n\r\nThere was, further, that never-ceasing pity in her soul for Giles as a\r\nman whom she had wronged\xe2\x80\x94a man who had been unfortunate in his worldly\r\ntransactions; while, not without a touch of sublimity, he had, like\r\nHoratio, borne himself throughout his scathing\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs one, in suffering all, that suffers nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was these perceptions, and no subtle catching of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmurmurs, that had bred the abstraction visible in her.\r\n\r\nWhen her father approached the house after witnessing the interview\r\nbetween Fitzpiers and Mrs. Charmond, Grace was looking out of her\r\nsitting-room window, as if she had nothing to do, or think of, or care\r\nfor. He stood still.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Grace,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, regarding her fixedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, father,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWaiting for your dear husband?\xe2\x80\x9d he inquired, speaking with the sarcasm\r\nof pitiful affection.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no\xe2\x80\x94not especially. He has a great many patients to see this\r\nafternoon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMelbury came quite close. \xe2\x80\x9cGrace, what\xe2\x80\x99s the use of talking like that,\r\nwhen you know\xe2\x80\x94Here, come down and walk with me out in the garden,\r\nchild.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe unfastened the door in the ivy-laced wall, and waited. This apparent\r\nindifference alarmed him. He would far rather that she had rushed in\r\nall the fire of jealousy to Hintock House, regardless of\r\nconventionality, confronted and attacked Felice Charmond _unguibus et\r\nrostro_, and accused her even in exaggerated shape of stealing away her\r\nhusband. Such a storm might have cleared the air.\r\n\r\nShe emerged in a minute or two, and they went inside together. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nknow as well as I do,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed, \xe2\x80\x9cthat there is something threatening\r\nmischief to your life; and yet you pretend you do not. Do you suppose I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t see the trouble in your face every day? I am very sure that this\r\nquietude is wrong conduct in you. You should look more into matters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am quiet because my sadness is not of a nature to stir me to\r\naction.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMelbury wanted to ask her a dozen questions\xe2\x80\x94did she not feel jealous?\r\nwas she not indignant? but a natural delicacy restrained him. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are\r\nvery tame and let-alone, I am bound to say,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked, pointedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am what I feel, father,\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated.\r\n\r\nHe glanced at her, and there returned upon his mind the scene of her\r\noffering to wed Winterborne instead of Fitzpiers in the last days\r\nbefore her marriage; and he asked himself if it could be the fact that\r\nshe loved Winterborne, now that she had lost him, more than she had\r\never done when she was comparatively free to choose him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat would you have me do?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, in a low voice.\r\n\r\nHe recalled his mind from the retrospective pain to the practical\r\nmatter before them. \xe2\x80\x9cI would have you go to Mrs. Charmond,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo to Mrs. Charmond\xe2\x80\x94what for?\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94if I must speak plain, dear Grace\xe2\x80\x94to ask her, appeal to her in\r\nthe name of your common womanhood, and your many like sentiments on\r\nthings, not to make unhappiness between you and your husband. It lies\r\nwith her entirely to do one or the other\xe2\x80\x94that I can see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrace\xe2\x80\x99s face had heated at her father\xe2\x80\x99s words, and the very rustle of\r\nher skirts upon the box-edging bespoke hauteur. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall not think of\r\ngoing to her, father\xe2\x80\x94of course I could not!\xe2\x80\x9d she answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x99ee want to be happier than you be at present?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMelbury, more moved on her account than she was herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to be more humiliated. If I have anything to bear I can\r\nbear it in silence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, my dear maid, you are too young\xe2\x80\x94you don\xe2\x80\x99t know what the present\r\nstate of things may lead to. Just see the harm done a\xe2\x80\x99ready! Your\r\nhusband would have gone away to Budmouth to a bigger practice if it had\r\nnot been for this. Although it has gone such a little way, it is\r\npoisoning your future even now. Mrs. Charmond is thoughtlessly bad, not\r\nbad by calculation; and just a word to her now might save \xe2\x80\x99ee a peck of\r\nwoes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, I loved her once,\xe2\x80\x9d said Grace, with a broken articulation, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nshe would not care for me then! Now I no longer love her. Let her do\r\nher worst: I don\xe2\x80\x99t care.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to care. You have got into a very good position to start\r\nwith. You have been well educated, well tended, and you have become the\r\nwife of a professional man of unusually good family. Surely you ought\r\nto make the best of your position.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see that I ought. I wish I had never got into it. I wish you\r\nhad never, never thought of educating me. I wish I worked in the woods\r\nlike Marty South. I hate genteel life, and I want to be no better than\r\nshe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d said her amazed father.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause cultivation has only brought me inconveniences and troubles. I\r\nsay again, I wish you had never sent me to those fashionable schools\r\nyou set your mind on. It all arose out of that, father. If I had stayed\r\nat home I should have married\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d She closed up her mouth suddenly and\r\nwas silent; and he saw that she was not far from crying.\r\n\r\nMelbury was much grieved. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat, and would you like to have grown up as\r\nwe be here in Hintock\xe2\x80\x94knowing no more, and with no more chance of\r\nseeing good life than we have here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I have never got any happiness outside Hintock that I know of,\r\nand I have suffered many a heartache at being sent away. Oh, the misery\r\nof those January days when I had got back to school, and left you all\r\nhere in the wood so happy. I used to wonder why I had to bear it. And I\r\nwas always a little despised by the other girls at school, because they\r\nknew where I came from, and that my parents were not in so good a\r\nstation as theirs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer poor father was much hurt at what he thought her ingratitude and\r\nintractability. He had admitted to himself bitterly enough that he\r\nshould have let young hearts have their way, or rather should have\r\nhelped on her affection for Winterborne, and given her to him according\r\nto his original plan; but he was not prepared for her deprecation of\r\nthose attainments whose completion had been a labor of years, and a\r\nsevere tax upon his purse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with much heaviness of spirit. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you don\xe2\x80\x99t like\r\nto go to her I don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to force you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd so the question remained for him still: how should he remedy this\r\nperilous state of things? For days he sat in a moody attitude over the\r\nfire, a pitcher of cider standing on the hearth beside him, and his\r\ndrinking-horn inverted upon the top of it. He spent a week and more\r\nthus composing a letter to the chief offender, which he would every now\r\nand then attempt to complete, and suddenly crumple up in his hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs February merged in March, and lighter evenings broke the gloom of\r\nthe woodmen\xe2\x80\x99s homeward journey, the Hintocks Great and Little began to\r\nhave ears for a rumor of the events out of which had grown the\r\ntimber-dealer\xe2\x80\x99s troubles. It took the form of a wide sprinkling of\r\nconjecture, wherein no man knew the exact truth. Tantalizing phenomena,\r\nat once showing and concealing the real relationship of the persons\r\nconcerned, caused a diffusion of excited surprise. Honest people as the\r\nwoodlanders were, it was hardly to be expected that they could remain\r\nimmersed in the study of their trees and gardens amid such\r\ncircumstances, or sit with their backs turned like the good burghers of\r\nCoventry at the passage of the beautiful lady.\r\n\r\nRumor, for a wonder, exaggerated little. There were, in fact, in this\r\ncase as in thousands, the well-worn incidents, old as the hills, which,\r\nwith individual variations, made a mourner of Ariadne, a by-word of\r\nVashti, and a corpse of the Countess Amy. There were rencounters\r\naccidental and contrived, stealthy correspondence, sudden misgivings on\r\none side, sudden self-reproaches on the other. The inner state of the\r\ntwain was one as of confused noise that would not allow the accents of\r\ncalmer reason to be heard. Determinations to go in this direction, and\r\nheadlong plunges in that; dignified safeguards, undignified collapses;\r\nnot a single rash step by deliberate intention, and all against\r\njudgment.\r\n\r\nIt was all that Melbury had expected and feared. It was more, for he\r\nhad overlooked the publicity that would be likely to result, as it now\r\nhad done. What should he do\xe2\x80\x94appeal to Mrs. Charmond himself, since\r\nGrace would not? He bethought himself of Winterborne, and resolved to\r\nconsult him, feeling the strong need of some friend of his own sex to\r\nwhom he might unburden his mind.\r\n\r\nHe had entirely lost faith in his own judgment. That judgment on which\r\nhe had relied for so many years seemed recently, like a false companion\r\nunmasked, to have disclosed unexpected depths of hypocrisy and\r\nspeciousness where all had seemed solidity. He felt almost afraid to\r\nform a conjecture on the weather, or the time, or the fruit-promise, so\r\ngreat was his self-abasement.\r\n\r\nIt was a rimy evening when he set out to look for Giles. The woods\r\nseemed to be in a cold sweat; beads of perspiration hung from every\r\nbare twig; the sky had no color, and the trees rose before him as\r\nhaggard, gray phantoms, whose days of substantiality were passed.\r\nMelbury seldom saw Winterborne now, but he believed him to be occupying\r\na lonely hut just beyond the boundary of Mrs. Charmond\xe2\x80\x99s estate, though\r\nstill within the circuit of the woodland. The timber-merchant\xe2\x80\x99s thin\r\nlegs stalked on through the pale, damp scenery, his eyes on the dead\r\nleaves of last year; while every now and then a hasty \xe2\x80\x9cAy?\xe2\x80\x9d escaped his\r\nlips in reply to some bitter proposition.\r\n\r\nHis notice was attracted by a thin blue haze of smoke, behind which\r\narose sounds of voices and chopping: bending his steps that way, he saw\r\nWinterborne just in front of him. It just now happened that Giles,\r\nafter being for a long time apathetic and unemployed, had become one of\r\nthe busiest men in the neighborhood. It is often thus; fallen friends,\r\nlost sight of, we expect to find starving; we discover them going on\r\nfairly well. Without any solicitation, or desire for profit on his\r\npart, he had been asked to execute during that winter a very large\r\norder for hurdles and other copse-ware, for which purpose he had been\r\nobliged to buy several acres of brushwood standing. He was now engaged\r\nin the cutting and manufacture of the same, proceeding with the work\r\ndaily like an automaton.\r\n\r\nThe hazel-tree did not belie its name to-day. The whole of the\r\ncopse-wood where the mist had cleared returned purest tints of that\r\nhue, amid which Winterborne himself was in the act of making a hurdle,\r\nthe stakes being driven firmly into the ground in a row, over which he\r\nbent and wove the twigs. Beside him was a square, compact pile like the\r\naltar of Cain, formed of hurdles already finished, which bristled on\r\nall sides with the sharp points of their stakes. At a little distance\r\nthe men in his employ were assisting him to carry out his contract.\r\nRows of copse-wood lay on the ground as it had fallen under the axe;\r\nand a shelter had been constructed near at hand, in front of which\r\nburned the fire whose smoke had attracted him. The air was so dank that\r\nthe smoke hung heavy, and crept away amid the bushes without rising\r\nfrom the ground.\r\n\r\nAfter wistfully regarding Winterborne a while, Melbury drew nearer, and\r\nbriefly inquired of Giles how he came to be so busily engaged, with an\r\nundertone of slight surprise that Winterborne could seem so thriving\r\nafter being deprived of Grace. Melbury was not without emotion at the\r\nmeeting; for Grace\xe2\x80\x99s affairs had divided them, and ended their intimacy\r\nof old times.\r\n\r\nWinterborne explained just as briefly, without raising his eyes from\r\nhis occupation of chopping a bough that he held in front of him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Twill be up in April before you get it all cleared,\xe2\x80\x9d said Melbury.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, there or thereabouts,\xe2\x80\x9d said Winterborne, a chop of the billhook\r\njerking the last word into two pieces.\r\n\r\nThere was another interval; Melbury still looked on, a chip from\r\nWinterborne\xe2\x80\x99s hook occasionally flying against the waistcoat and legs\r\nof his visitor, who took no heed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Giles\xe2\x80\x94you should have been my partner. You should have been my\r\nson-in-law,\xe2\x80\x9d the old man said at last. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would have been far better\r\nfor her and for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWinterborne saw that something had gone wrong with his former friend,\r\nand throwing down the switch he was about to interweave, he responded\r\nonly too readily to the mood of the timber-dealer. \xe2\x80\x9cIs she ill?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, hurriedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no.\xe2\x80\x9d Melbury stood without speaking for some minutes, and then, as\r\nthough he could not bring himself to proceed, turned to go away.\r\n\r\nWinterborne told one of his men to pack up the tools for the night and\r\nwalked after Melbury.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeaven forbid that I should seem too inquisitive, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cespecially since we don\xe2\x80\x99t stand as we used to stand to one another;\r\nbut I hope it is well with them all over your way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Melbury\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cno.\xe2\x80\x9d He stopped, and struck the smooth trunk of a\r\nyoung ash-tree with the flat of his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cI would that his ear had\r\nbeen where that rind is!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed; \xe2\x80\x9cI should have treated him to\r\nlittle compared wi what he deserves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Winterborne, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t be in a hurry to go home. I\xe2\x80\x99ve put some\r\ncider down to warm in my shelter here, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll sit and drink it and\r\ntalk this over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMelbury turned unresistingly as Giles took his arm, and they went back\r\nto where the fire was, and sat down under the screen, the other woodmen\r\nhaving gone. He drew out the cider-mug from the ashes and they drank\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGiles, you ought to have had her, as I said just now,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated\r\nMelbury. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you why for the first time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe thereupon told Winterborne, as with great relief, the story of how\r\nhe won away Giles\xe2\x80\x99s father\xe2\x80\x99s chosen one\xe2\x80\x94by nothing worse than a lover\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncajoleries, it is true, but by means which, except in love, would\r\ncertainly have been pronounced cruel and unfair. He explained how he\r\nhad always intended to make reparation to Winterborne the father by\r\ngiving Grace to Winterborne the son, till the devil tempted him in the\r\nperson of Fitzpiers, and he broke his virtuous vow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow highly I thought of that man, to be sure! Who\xe2\x80\x99d have supposed he\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nhave been so weak and wrong-headed as this! You ought to have had her,\r\nGiles, and there\xe2\x80\x99s an end on\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWinterborne knew how to preserve his calm under this unconsciously\r\ncruel tearing of a healing wound to which Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s concentration on\r\nthe more vital subject had blinded him. The young man endeavored to\r\nmake the best of the case for Grace\xe2\x80\x99s sake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe would hardly have been happy with me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in the dry,\r\nunimpassioned voice under which he hid his feelings. \xe2\x80\x9cI was not well\r\nenough educated: too rough, in short. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have surrounded her\r\nwith the refinements she looked for, anyhow, at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense\xe2\x80\x94you are quite wrong there,\xe2\x80\x9d said the unwise old man,\r\ndoggedly. \xe2\x80\x9cShe told me only this day that she hates refinements and\r\nsuch like. All that my trouble and money bought for her in that way is\r\nthrown away upon her quite. She\xe2\x80\x99d fain be like Marty South\xe2\x80\x94think o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthat! That\xe2\x80\x99s the top of her ambition! Perhaps she\xe2\x80\x99s right. Giles, she\r\nloved you\xe2\x80\x94under the rind; and, what\xe2\x80\x99s more, she loves ye still\xe2\x80\x94worse\r\nluck for the poor maid!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf Melbury only had known what fires he was recklessly stirring up he\r\nmight have held his peace. Winterborne was silent a long time. The\r\ndarkness had closed in round them, and the monotonous drip of the fog\r\nfrom the branches quickened as it turned to fine rain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, she never cared much for me,\xe2\x80\x9d Giles managed to say, as he stirred\r\nthe embers with a brand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe did, and does, I tell ye,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other, obstinately. \xe2\x80\x9cHowever,\r\nall that\xe2\x80\x99s vain talking now. What I come to ask you about is a more\r\npractical matter\xe2\x80\x94how to make the best of things as they are. I am\r\nthinking of a desperate step\xe2\x80\x94of calling on the woman Charmond. I am\r\ngoing to appeal to her, since Grace will not. \xe2\x80\x99Tis she who holds the\r\nbalance in her hands\xe2\x80\x94not he. While she\xe2\x80\x99s got the will to lead him\r\nastray he will follow\xe2\x80\x94poor, unpractical, lofty-notioned dreamer\xe2\x80\x94and how\r\nlong she\xe2\x80\x99ll do it depends upon her whim. Did ye ever hear anything\r\nabout her character before she came to Hintock?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s been a bit of a charmer in her time, I believe,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Giles,\r\nwith the same level quietude, as he regarded the red coals. \xe2\x80\x9cOne who\r\nhas smiled where she has not loved and loved where she has not married.\r\nBefore Mr. Charmond made her his wife she was a play-actress.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHey? But how close you have kept all this, Giles! What besides?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Charmond was a rich man, engaged in the iron trade in the north,\r\ntwenty or thirty years older than she. He married her and retired, and\r\ncame down here and bought this property, as they do nowadays.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes\xe2\x80\x94I know all about that; but the other I did not know. I fear\r\nit bodes no good. For how can I go and appeal to the forbearance of a\r\nwoman in this matter who has made cross-loves and crooked entanglements\r\nher trade for years? I thank ye, Giles, for finding it out; but it\r\nmakes my plan the harder that she should have belonged to that unstable\r\ntribe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnother pause ensued, and they looked gloomily at the smoke that beat\r\nabout the hurdles which sheltered them, through whose weavings a large\r\ndrop of rain fell at intervals and spat smartly into the fire. Mrs.\r\nCharmond had been no friend to Winterborne, but he was manly, and it\r\nwas not in his heart to let her be condemned without a trial.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is said to be generous,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cYou might not appeal to her\r\nin vain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt shall be done,\xe2\x80\x9d said Melbury, rising. \xe2\x80\x9cFor good or for evil, to\r\nMrs. Charmond I\xe2\x80\x99ll go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock the next morning Melbury dressed himself up in shining\r\nbroadcloth, creased with folding and smelling of camphor, and started\r\nfor Hintock House. He was the more impelled to go at once by the\r\nabsence of his son-in-law in London for a few days, to attend, really\r\nor ostensibly, some professional meetings. He said nothing of his\r\ndestination either to his wife or to Grace, fearing that they might\r\nentreat him to abandon so risky a project, and went out unobserved. He\r\nhad chosen his time with a view, as he supposed, of conveniently\r\ncatching Mrs. Charmond when she had just finished her breakfast, before\r\nany other business people should be about, if any came. Plodding\r\nthoughtfully onward, he crossed a glade lying between Little Hintock\r\nWoods and the plantation which abutted on the park; and the spot being\r\nopen, he was discerned there by Winterborne from the copse on the next\r\nhill, where he and his men were working. Knowing his mission, the\r\nyounger man hastened down from the copse and managed to intercept the\r\ntimber-merchant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been thinking of this, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand I am of opinion that\r\nit would be best to put off your visit for the present.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Melbury would not even stop to hear him. His mind was made up, the\r\nappeal was to be made; and Winterborne stood and watched him sadly till\r\nhe entered the second plantation and disappeared.\r\n\r\nMelbury rang at the tradesmen\xe2\x80\x99s door of the manor-house, and was at\r\nonce informed that the lady was not yet visible, as indeed he might\r\nhave guessed had he been anybody but the man he was. Melbury said he\r\nwould wait, whereupon the young man informed him in a neighborly way\r\nthat, between themselves, she was in bed and asleep.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind,\xe2\x80\x9d said Melbury, retreating into the court, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll stand\r\nabout here.\xe2\x80\x9d Charged so fully with his mission, he shrank from contact\r\nwith anybody.\r\n\r\nBut he walked about the paved court till he was tired, and still nobody\r\ncame to him. At last he entered the house and sat down in a small\r\nwaiting-room, from which he got glimpses of the kitchen corridor, and\r\nof the white-capped maids flitting jauntily hither and thither. They\r\nhad heard of his arrival, but had not seen him enter, and, imagining\r\nhim still in the court, discussed freely the possible reason of his\r\ncalling. They marvelled at his temerity; for though most of the tongues\r\nwhich had been let loose attributed the chief blame-worthiness to\r\nFitzpiers, these of her household preferred to regard their mistress as\r\nthe deeper sinner.\r\n\r\nMelbury sat with his hands resting on the familiar knobbed thorn\r\nwalking-stick, whose growing he had seen before he enjoyed its use. The\r\nscene to him was not the material environment of his person, but a\r\ntragic vision that travelled with him like an envelope. Through this\r\nvision the incidents of the moment but gleamed confusedly here and\r\nthere, as an outer landscape through the high-colored scenes of a\r\nstained window. He waited thus an hour, an hour and a half, two hours.\r\nHe began to look pale and ill, whereupon the butler, who came in, asked\r\nhim to have a glass of wine. Melbury roused himself and said, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, no.\r\nIs she almost ready?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is just finishing breakfast,\xe2\x80\x9d said the butler. \xe2\x80\x9cShe will soon see\r\nyou now. I am just going up to tell her you are here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! haven\xe2\x80\x99t you told her before?\xe2\x80\x9d said Melbury.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see you came so very early.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt last the bell rang: Mrs. Charmond could see him. She was not in her\r\nprivate sitting-room when he reached it, but in a minute he heard her\r\ncoming from the front staircase, and she entered where he stood.\r\n\r\nAt this time of the morning Mrs. Charmond looked her full age and more.\r\nShe might almost have been taken for the typical _femme de trente ans_,\r\nthough she was really not more than seven or eight and twenty. There\r\nbeing no fire in the room, she came in with a shawl thrown loosely\r\nround her shoulders, and obviously without the least suspicion that\r\nMelbury had called upon any other errand than timber. Felice was,\r\nindeed, the only woman in the parish who had not heard the rumor of her\r\nown weaknesses; she was at this moment living in a fool\xe2\x80\x99s paradise in\r\nrespect of that rumor, though not in respect of the weaknesses\r\nthemselves, which, if the truth be told, caused her grave misgivings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo sit down, Mr. Melbury. You have felled all the trees that were to\r\nbe purchased by you this season, except the oaks, I believe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Melbury.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow very nice! It must be so charming to work in the woods just now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was too careless to affect an interest in an extraneous person\xe2\x80\x99s\r\naffairs so consummately as to deceive in the manner of the perfect\r\nsocial machine. Hence her words \xe2\x80\x9cvery nice,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cso charming,\xe2\x80\x9d were\r\nuttered with a perfunctoriness that made them sound absurdly unreal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Melbury, in a reverie. He did not take a chair, and\r\nshe also remained standing. Resting upon his stick, he began: \xe2\x80\x9cMrs.\r\nCharmond, I have called upon a more serious matter\xe2\x80\x94at least to me\xe2\x80\x94than\r\ntree-throwing. And whatever mistakes I make in my manner of speaking\r\nupon it to you, madam, do me the justice to set \xe2\x80\x99em down to my want of\r\npractice, and not to my want of care.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Charmond looked ill at ease. She might have begun to guess his\r\nmeaning; but apart from that, she had such dread of contact with\r\nanything painful, harsh, or even earnest, that his preliminaries alone\r\nwere enough to distress her. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, what is it?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am an old man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Melbury, \xe2\x80\x9cwhom, somewhat late in life, God\r\nthought fit to bless with one child, and she a daughter. Her mother was\r\na very dear wife to me, but she was taken away from us when the child\r\nwas young, and the child became precious as the apple of my eye to me,\r\nfor she was all I had left to love. For her sake entirely I married as\r\nsecond wife a homespun woman who had been kind as a mother to her. In\r\ndue time the question of her education came on, and I said, \xe2\x80\x98I will\r\neducate the maid well, if I live upon bread to do it.\xe2\x80\x99 Of her possible\r\nmarriage I could not bear to think, for it seemed like a death that she\r\nshould cleave to another man, and grow to think his house her home\r\nrather than mine. But I saw it was the law of nature that this should\r\nbe, and that it was for the maid\xe2\x80\x99s happiness that she should have a\r\nhome when I was gone; and I made up my mind without a murmur to help it\r\non for her sake. In my youth I had wronged my dead friend, and to make\r\namends I determined to give her, my most precious possession, to my\r\nfriend\xe2\x80\x99s son, seeing that they liked each other well. Things came about\r\nwhich made me doubt if it would be for my daughter\xe2\x80\x99s happiness to do\r\nthis, inasmuch as the young man was poor, and she was delicately\r\nreared. Another man came and paid court to her\xe2\x80\x94one her equal in\r\nbreeding and accomplishments; in every way it seemed to me that he only\r\ncould give her the home which her training had made a necessity almost.\r\nI urged her on, and she married him. But, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, a fatal mistake was at\r\nthe root of my reckoning. I found that this well-born gentleman I had\r\ncalculated on so surely was not stanch of heart, and that therein lay a\r\ndanger of great sorrow for my daughter. Madam, he saw you, and you know\r\nthe rest....I have come to make no demands\xe2\x80\x94to utter no threats; I have\r\ncome simply as a father in great grief about this only child, and I\r\nbeseech you to deal kindly with my daughter, and to do nothing which\r\ncan turn her husband\xe2\x80\x99s heart away from her forever. Forbid him your\r\npresence, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, and speak to him on his duty as one with your power\r\nover him well can do, and I am hopeful that the rent between them may\r\nbe patched up. For it is not as if you would lose by so doing; your\r\ncourse is far higher than the courses of a simple professional man, and\r\nthe gratitude you would win from me and mine by your kindness is more\r\nthan I can say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Charmond had first rushed into a mood of indignation on\r\ncomprehending Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s story; hot and cold by turns, she had murmured,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave me, leave me!\xe2\x80\x9d But as he seemed to take no notice of this, his\r\nwords began to influence her, and when he ceased speaking she said,\r\nwith hurried, hot breath, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat has led you to think this of me? Who\r\nsays I have won your daughter\xe2\x80\x99s husband away from her? Some monstrous\r\ncalumnies are afloat\xe2\x80\x94of which I have known nothing until now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMelbury started, and looked at her simply. \xe2\x80\x9cBut surely, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, you know\r\nthe truth better than I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer features became a little pinched, and the touches of powder on her\r\nhandsome face for the first time showed themselves as an extrinsic\r\nfilm. \xe2\x80\x9cWill you leave me to myself?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with a faintness which\r\nsuggested a guilty conscience. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is so utterly unexpected\xe2\x80\x94you\r\nobtain admission to my presence by misrepresentation\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs God\xe2\x80\x99s in heaven, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, that\xe2\x80\x99s not true. I made no pretence; and I\r\nthought in reason you would know why I had come. This gossip\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have heard nothing of it. Tell me of it, I say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell you, ma\xe2\x80\x99am\xe2\x80\x94not I. What the gossip is, no matter. What really is,\r\nyou know. Set facts right, and the scandal will right of itself. But\r\npardon me\xe2\x80\x94I speak roughly; and I came to speak gently, to coax you, beg\r\nyou to be my daughter\xe2\x80\x99s friend. She loved you once, ma\xe2\x80\x99am; you began by\r\nliking her. Then you dropped her without a reason, and it hurt her warm\r\nheart more than I can tell ye. But you were within your right as the\r\nsuperior, no doubt. But if you would consider her position now\xe2\x80\x94surely,\r\nsurely, you would do her no harm!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly I would do her no harm\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s eye met hers. It was\r\ncurious, but the allusion to Grace\xe2\x80\x99s former love for her seemed to\r\ntouch her more than all Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s other arguments. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Melbury,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nburst out, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have made me so unhappy! How could you come to me like\r\nthis! It is too dreadful! Now go away\xe2\x80\x94go, go!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in a husky tone.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he was out of the room she went to a corner and there sat\r\nand writhed under an emotion in which hurt pride and vexation mingled\r\nwith better sentiments.\r\n\r\nMrs. Charmond\xe2\x80\x99s mobile spirit was subject to these fierce periods of\r\nstress and storm. She had never so clearly perceived till now that her\r\nsoul was being slowly invaded by a delirium which had brought about all\r\nthis; that she was losing judgment and dignity under it, becoming an\r\nanimated impulse only, a passion incarnate. A fascination had led her\r\non; it was as if she had been seized by a hand of velvet; and this was\r\nwhere she found herself\xe2\x80\x94overshadowed with sudden night, as if a tornado\r\nhad passed by.\r\n\r\nWhile she sat, or rather crouched, unhinged by the interview,\r\nlunch-time came, and then the early afternoon, almost without her\r\nconsciousness. Then \xe2\x80\x9ca strange gentleman who says it is not necessary\r\nto give his name,\xe2\x80\x9d was suddenly announced.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot see him, whoever he may be. I am not at home to anybody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe heard no more of her visitor; and shortly after, in an attempt to\r\nrecover some mental serenity by violent physical exercise, she put on\r\nher hat and cloak and went out-of-doors, taking a path which led her up\r\nthe slopes to the nearest spur of the wood. She disliked the woods, but\r\nthey had the advantage of being a place in which she could walk\r\ncomparatively unobserved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was agitation to-day in the lives of all whom these matters\r\nconcerned. It was not till the Hintock dinner-time\xe2\x80\x94one o\xe2\x80\x99clock\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nGrace discovered her father\xe2\x80\x99s absence from the house after a departure\r\nin the morning under somewhat unusual conditions. By a little reasoning\r\nand inquiry she was able to come to a conclusion on his destination,\r\nand to divine his errand.\r\n\r\nHer husband was absent, and her father did not return. He had, in\r\ntruth, gone on to Sherton after the interview, but this Grace did not\r\nknow. In an indefinite dread that something serious would arise out of\r\nMelbury\xe2\x80\x99s visit by reason of the inequalities of temper and nervous\r\nirritation to which he was subject, something possibly that would bring\r\nher much more misery than accompanied her present negative state of\r\nmind, she left the house about three o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and took a loitering walk\r\nin the woodland track by which she imagined he would come home. This\r\ntrack under the bare trees and over the cracking sticks, screened and\r\nroofed in from the outer world of wind and cloud by a net-work of\r\nboughs, led her slowly on till in time she had left the larger trees\r\nbehind her and swept round into the coppice where Winterborne and his\r\nmen were clearing the undergrowth.\r\n\r\nHad Giles\xe2\x80\x99s attention been concentrated on his hurdles he would not\r\nhave seen her; but ever since Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s passage across the opposite\r\nglade in the morning he had been as uneasy and unsettled as Grace\r\nherself; and her advent now was the one appearance which, since her\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s avowal, could arrest him more than Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s return with his\r\ntidings. Fearing that something might be the matter, he hastened up to\r\nher.\r\n\r\nShe had not seen her old lover for a long time, and, too conscious of\r\nthe late pranks of her heart, she could not behold him calmly. \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\nonly looking for my father,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in an unnecessarily apologetic\r\nintonation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was looking for him too,\xe2\x80\x9d said Giles. \xe2\x80\x9cI think he may perhaps have\r\ngone on farther.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you knew he was going to the House, Giles?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, turning her\r\nlarge tender eyes anxiously upon him. \xe2\x80\x9cDid he tell you what for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWinterborne glanced doubtingly at her, and then softly hinted that her\r\nfather had visited him the evening before, and that their old\r\nfriendship was quite restored, on which she guessed the rest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I am glad, indeed, that you two are friends again!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. And\r\nthen they stood facing each other, fearing each other, troubling each\r\nother\xe2\x80\x99s souls. Grace experienced acute misery at the sight of these\r\nwood-cutting scenes, because she had estranged herself from them,\r\ncraving, even to its defects and inconveniences, that homely sylvan\r\nlife of her father which in the best probable succession of events\r\nwould shortly be denied her.\r\n\r\nAt a little distance, on the edge of the clearing, Marty South was\r\nshaping spar-gads to take home for manufacture during the evenings.\r\nWhile Winterborne and Mrs. Fitzpiers stood looking at her in their\r\nmutual embarrassment at each other\xe2\x80\x99s presence, they beheld approaching\r\nthe girl a lady in a dark fur mantle and a black hat, having a white\r\nveil tied picturesquely round it. She spoke to Marty, who turned and\r\ncourtesied, and the lady fell into conversation with her. It was Mrs.\r\nCharmond.\r\n\r\nOn leaving her house, Mrs. Charmond had walked on and onward under the\r\nfret and fever of her mind with more vigor than she was accustomed to\r\nshow in her normal moods\xe2\x80\x94a fever which the solace of a cigarette did\r\nnot entirely allay. Reaching the coppice, she listlessly observed Marty\r\nat work, threw away her cigarette, and came near. Chop, chop, chop,\r\nwent Marty\xe2\x80\x99s little billhook with never more assiduity, till Mrs.\r\nCharmond spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is that young lady I see talking to the woodman yonder?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Fitzpiers, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Charmond, with something like a start; for she had not\r\nrecognized Grace at that distance. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd the man she is talking to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s Mr. Winterborne.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA redness stole into Marty\xe2\x80\x99s face as she mentioned Giles\xe2\x80\x99s name, which\r\nMrs. Charmond did not fail to notice informed her of the state of the\r\ngirl\xe2\x80\x99s heart. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you engaged to him?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, softly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marty. \xe2\x80\x9c_She_ was once; and I think\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Marty could not possibly explain the complications of her thoughts\r\non this matter\xe2\x80\x94which were nothing less than one of extraordinary\r\nacuteness for a girl so young and inexperienced\xe2\x80\x94namely, that she saw\r\ndanger to two hearts naturally honest in Grace being thrown back into\r\nWinterborne\xe2\x80\x99s society by the neglect of her husband. Mrs. Charmond,\r\nhowever, with the almost supersensory means to knowledge which women\r\nhave on such occasions, quite understood what Marty had intended to\r\nconvey, and the picture thus exhibited to her of lives drifting away,\r\ninvolving the wreck of poor Marty\xe2\x80\x99s hopes, prompted her to more\r\ngenerous resolves than all Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s remonstrances had been able to\r\nstimulate.\r\n\r\nFull of the new feeling, she bade the girl good-afternoon, and went on\r\nover the stumps of hazel to where Grace and Winterborne were standing.\r\nThey saw her approach, and Winterborne said, \xe2\x80\x9cShe is coming to you; it\r\nis a good omen. She dislikes me, so I\xe2\x80\x99ll go away.\xe2\x80\x9d He accordingly\r\nretreated to where he had been working before Grace came, and Grace\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nformidable rival approached her, each woman taking the other\xe2\x80\x99s measure\r\nas she came near.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear\xe2\x80\x94Mrs. Fitzpiers,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felice Charmond, with some inward turmoil\r\nwhich stopped her speech. \xe2\x80\x9cI have not seen you for a long time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe held out her hand tentatively, while Grace stood like a wild animal\r\non first confronting a mirror or other puzzling product of\r\ncivilization. Was it really Mrs. Charmond speaking to her thus? If it\r\nwas, she could no longer form any guess as to what it signified.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to talk with you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Charmond, imploringly, for the\r\ngaze of the young woman had chilled her through. \xe2\x80\x9cCan you walk on with\r\nme till we are quite alone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSick with distaste, Grace nevertheless complied, as by clockwork and\r\nthey moved evenly side by side into the deeper recesses of the woods.\r\nThey went farther, much farther than Mrs. Charmond had meant to go; but\r\nshe could not begin her conversation, and in default of it kept\r\nwalking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have seen your father,\xe2\x80\x9d she at length resumed. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\xe2\x80\x94I am much\r\ntroubled by what he told me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did he tell you? I have not been admitted to his confidence on\r\nanything he may have said to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNevertheless, why should I repeat to you what you can easily divine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue\xe2\x80\x94true,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Grace, mournfully. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy should you repeat what we\r\nboth know to be in our minds already?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Fitzpiers, your husband\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d The moment that the speaker\xe2\x80\x99s tongue\r\ntouched the dangerous subject a vivid look of self-consciousness\r\nflashed over her, in which her heart revealed, as by a lightning gleam,\r\nwhat filled it to overflowing. So transitory was the expression that\r\nnone but a sensitive woman, and she in Grace\xe2\x80\x99s position, would have had\r\nthe power to catch its meaning. Upon her the phase was not lost.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you _do_ love him!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, in a tone of much surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean, my young friend?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Grace, \xe2\x80\x9cI thought till now that you had only been cruelly\r\nflirting with my husband, to amuse your idle moments\xe2\x80\x94a rich lady with a\r\npoor professional gentleman whom in her heart she despised not much\r\nless than her who belongs to him. But I guess from your manner that you\r\nlove him desperately, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t hate you as I did before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Mrs. Fitzpiers, with a trembling tongue,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csince it is not playing in your case at all, but _real_. Oh, I do pity\r\nyou, more than I despise you, for _you_ will s-s-suffer most!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Charmond was now as much agitated as Grace. \xe2\x80\x9cI ought not to allow\r\nmyself to argue with you,\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cI demean myself by doing it.\r\nBut I liked you once, and for the sake of that time I try to tell you\r\nhow mistaken you are!\xe2\x80\x9d Much of her confusion resulted from her wonder\r\nand alarm at finding herself in a sense dominated mentally and\r\nemotionally by this simple school-girl. \xe2\x80\x9cI do not love him,\xe2\x80\x9d she went\r\non, with desperate untruth. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a kindness\xe2\x80\x94my making somewhat more\r\nof him than one usually does of one\xe2\x80\x99s doctor. I was lonely; I\r\ntalked\xe2\x80\x94well, I trifled with him. I am very sorry if such child\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nplaying out of pure friendship has been a serious matter to you. Who\r\ncould have expected it? But the world is so simple here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that\xe2\x80\x99s affectation,\xe2\x80\x9d said Grace, shaking her head. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is no\r\nuse\xe2\x80\x94you _love_ him. I can see in your face that in this matter of my\r\nhusband you have not let your acts belie your feelings. During these\r\nlast four or six months you have been terribly indiscreet; but you have\r\nnot been insincere, and that almost disarms me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI _have_ been insincere\xe2\x80\x94if you will have the word\xe2\x80\x94I mean I _have_\r\ncoquetted, and do _not_ love him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Grace clung to her position like a limpet. \xe2\x80\x9cYou may have trifled\r\nwith others, but him you love as you never loved another man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, well\xe2\x80\x94I won\xe2\x80\x99t argue,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Charmond, laughing faintly. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nyou come to reproach me for it, child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Grace, magnanimously. \xe2\x80\x9cYou may go on loving him if you\r\nlike\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind at all. You\xe2\x80\x99ll find it, let me tell you, a bitterer\r\nbusiness for yourself than for me in the end. He\xe2\x80\x99ll get tired of you\r\nsoon, as tired as can be\xe2\x80\x94you don\xe2\x80\x99t know him so well as I\xe2\x80\x94and then you\r\nmay wish you had never seen him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Charmond had grown quite pale and weak under this prophecy. It was\r\nextraordinary that Grace, whom almost every one would have\r\ncharacterized as a gentle girl, should be of stronger fibre than her\r\ninterlocutor. \xe2\x80\x9cYou exaggerate\xe2\x80\x94cruel, silly young woman,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nreiterated, writhing with little agonies. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is nothing but playful\r\nfriendship\xe2\x80\x94nothing! It will be proved by my future conduct. I shall at\r\nonce refuse to see him more\xe2\x80\x94since it will make no difference to my\r\nheart, and much to my name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI question if you will refuse to see him again,\xe2\x80\x9d said Grace, dryly, as\r\nwith eyes askance she bent a sapling down. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I am not incensed\r\nagainst you as you are against me,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, abandoning the tree to\r\nits natural perpendicular. \xe2\x80\x9cBefore I came I had been despising you for\r\nwanton cruelty; now I only pity you for misplaced affection. When Edgar\r\nhas gone out of the house in hope of seeing you, at seasonable hours\r\nand unseasonable; when I have found him riding miles and miles across\r\nthe country at midnight, and risking his life, and getting covered with\r\nmud, to get a glimpse of you, I have called him a foolish man\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nplaything of a finished coquette. I thought that what was getting to be\r\na tragedy to me was a comedy to you. But now I see that tragedy lies on\r\nYOUR side of the situation no less than on mine, and more; that if I\r\nhave felt trouble at my position, you have felt anguish at yours; that\r\nif I have had disappointments, you have had despairs. Heaven may\r\nfortify _me_\xe2\x80\x94God help _you!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot attempt to reply to your raving eloquence,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the\r\nother, struggling to restore a dignity which had completely collapsed.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy acts will be my proofs. In the world which you have seen nothing\r\nof, friendships between men and women are not unknown, and it would\r\nhave been better both for you and your father if you had each judged me\r\nmore respectfully, and left me alone. As it is I wish never to see or\r\nspeak to you, madam, any more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrace bowed, and Mrs. Charmond turned away. The two went apart in\r\ndirectly opposite courses, and were soon hidden from each other by\r\ntheir umbrageous surroundings and by the shadows of eve.\r\n\r\nIn the excitement of their long argument they had walked onward and\r\nzigzagged about without regarding direction or distance. All sound of\r\nthe woodcutters had long since faded into remoteness, and even had not\r\nthe interval been too great for hearing them they would have been\r\nsilent and homeward bound at this twilight hour. But Grace went on her\r\ncourse without any misgiving, though there was much underwood here,\r\nwith only the narrowest passages for walking, across which brambles\r\nhung. She had not, however, traversed this the wildest part of the wood\r\nsince her childhood, and the transformation of outlines had been great;\r\nold trees which once were landmarks had been felled or blown down, and\r\nthe bushes which then had been small and scrubby were now large and\r\noverhanging. She soon found that her ideas as to direction were\r\nvague\xe2\x80\x94that she had indeed no ideas as to direction at all. If the\r\nevening had not been growing so dark, and the wind had not put on its\r\nnight moan so distinctly, Grace would not have minded; but she was\r\nrather frightened now, and began to strike across hither and thither in\r\nrandom courses.\r\n\r\nDenser grew the darkness, more developed the wind-voices, and still no\r\nrecognizable spot or outlet of any kind appeared, nor any sound of the\r\nHintocks floated near, though she had wandered probably between one and\r\ntwo hours, and began to be weary. She was vexed at her foolishness,\r\nsince the ground she had covered, if in a straight line, must\r\ninevitably have taken her out of the wood to some remote village or\r\nother; but she had wasted her forces in countermarches; and now, in\r\nmuch alarm, wondered if she would have to pass the night here. She\r\nstood still to meditate, and fancied that between the soughing of the\r\nwind she heard shuffling footsteps on the leaves heavier than those of\r\nrabbits or hares. Though fearing at first to meet anybody on the chance\r\nof his being a friend, she decided that the fellow night-rambler, even\r\nif a poacher, would not injure her, and that he might possibly be some\r\none sent to search for her. She accordingly shouted a rather timid\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHoi!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe cry was immediately returned by the other person; and Grace running\r\nat once in the direction whence it came beheld an indistinct figure\r\nhastening up to her as rapidly. They were almost in each other\xe2\x80\x99s arms\r\nwhen she recognized in her vis-a-vis the outline and white veil of her\r\nwhom she had parted from an hour and a half before\xe2\x80\x94Mrs. Charmond.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have lost my way, I have lost my way,\xe2\x80\x9d cried that lady. \xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x94is it\r\nindeed you? I am so glad to meet you or anybody. I have been wandering\r\nup and down ever since we parted, and am nearly dead with terror and\r\nmisery and fatigue!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo am I,\xe2\x80\x9d said Grace. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat _shall_ we, _shall_ we do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t go away from me?\xe2\x80\x9d asked her companion, anxiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, indeed. Are you very tired?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can scarcely move, and I am scratched dreadfully about the ankles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrace reflected. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps, as it is dry under foot, the best thing for\r\nus to do would be to sit down for half an hour, and then start again\r\nwhen we have thoroughly rested. By walking straight we must come to a\r\ntrack leading somewhere before the morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey found a clump of bushy hollies which afforded a shelter from the\r\nwind, and sat down under it, some tufts of dead fern, crisp and dry,\r\nthat remained from the previous season forming a sort of nest for them.\r\nBut it was cold, nevertheless, on this March night, particularly for\r\nGrace, who with the sanguine prematureness of youth in matters of\r\ndress, had considered it spring-time, and hence was not so warmly clad\r\nas Mrs. Charmond, who still wore her winter fur. But after sitting a\r\nwhile the latter lady shivered no less than Grace as the warmth\r\nimparted by her hasty walking began to go off, and they felt the cold\r\nair drawing through the holly leaves which scratched their backs and\r\nshoulders. Moreover, they could hear some drops of rain falling on the\r\ntrees, though none reached the nook in which they had ensconced\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf we were to cling close together,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Charmond, \xe2\x80\x9cwe should\r\nkeep each other warm. But,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, in an uneven voice, \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose\r\nyou won\xe2\x80\x99t come near me for the world!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause\xe2\x80\x94well, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I will\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t hate you at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey consequently crept up to one another, and being in the dark,\r\nlonely and weary, did what neither had dreamed of doing beforehand,\r\nclasped each other closely, Mrs. Charmond\xe2\x80\x99s furs consoling Grace\xe2\x80\x99s cold\r\nface, and each one\xe2\x80\x99s body as she breathed alternately heaving against\r\nthat of her companion.\r\n\r\nWhen a few minutes had been spent thus, Mrs. Charmond said, \xe2\x80\x9cI am so\r\nwretched!\xe2\x80\x9d in a heavy, emotional whisper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are frightened,\xe2\x80\x9d said Grace, kindly. \xe2\x80\x9cBut there is nothing to\r\nfear; I know these woods well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not at all frightened at the wood, but I am at other things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Charmond embraced Grace more and more tightly, and the younger\r\nwoman could feel her neighbor\xe2\x80\x99s breathings grow deeper and more\r\nspasmodic, as though uncontrollable feelings were germinating.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter I had left you,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, \xe2\x80\x9cI regretted something I had said.\r\nI have to make a confession\xe2\x80\x94I must make it!\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered, brokenly,\r\nthe instinct to indulge in warmth of sentiment which had led this woman\r\nof passions to respond to Fitzpiers in the first place leading her now\r\nto find luxurious comfort in opening her heart to his wife. \xe2\x80\x9cI said to\r\nyou I could give him up without pain or deprivation\xe2\x80\x94that he had only\r\nbeen my pastime. That was untrue\xe2\x80\x94it was said to deceive you. I could\r\nnot do it without much pain; and, what is more dreadful, I _cannot_\r\ngive him up\xe2\x80\x94even if I would\xe2\x80\x94of myself alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy? Because you love him, you mean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFelice Charmond denoted assent by a movement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew I was right!\xe2\x80\x9d said Grace, exaltedly. \xe2\x80\x9cBut that should not deter\r\nyou,\xe2\x80\x9d she presently added, in a moral tone. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, do struggle against\r\nit, and you will conquer!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are so simple, so simple!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Felice. \xe2\x80\x9cYou think, because you\r\nguessed my assumed indifference to him to be a sham, that you know the\r\nextremes that people are capable of going to! But a good deal more may\r\nhave been going on than you have fathomed with all your insight. I\r\n_cannot_ give him up until he chooses to give up me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut surely you are the superior in station and in every way, and the\r\ncut must come from you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTchut! Must I tell verbatim, you simple child? Oh, I suppose I must! I\r\nshall eat away my heart if I do not let out all, after meeting you like\r\nthis and finding how guileless you are.\xe2\x80\x9d She thereupon whispered a few\r\nwords in the girl\xe2\x80\x99s ear, and burst into a violent fit of sobbing.\r\n\r\nGrace started roughly away from the shelter of the fur, and sprang to\r\nher feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my God!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, thunderstruck at a revelation transcending\r\nher utmost suspicion. \xe2\x80\x9cCan it be\xe2\x80\x94can it be!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned as if to hasten away. But Felice Charmond\xe2\x80\x99s sobs came to her\r\near: deep darkness circled her about, the funereal trees rocked and\r\nchanted their diriges and placebos around her, and she did not know\r\nwhich way to go. After a moment of energy she felt mild again, and\r\nturned to the motionless woman at her feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you rested?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, in what seemed something like her own\r\nvoice grown ten years older.\r\n\r\nWithout an answer Mrs. Charmond slowly rose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean to betray me!\xe2\x80\x9d she said from the bitterest depths of her\r\nsoul. \xe2\x80\x9cOh fool, fool I!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Grace, shortly. \xe2\x80\x9cI mean no such thing. But let us be quick\r\nnow. We have a serious undertaking before us. Think of nothing but\r\ngoing straight on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey walked on in profound silence, pulling back boughs now growing\r\nwet, and treading down woodbine, but still keeping a pretty straight\r\ncourse. Grace began to be thoroughly worn out, and her companion too,\r\nwhen, on a sudden, they broke into the deserted highway at the hill-top\r\non which the Sherton man had waited for Mrs. Dollery\xe2\x80\x99s van. Grace\r\nrecognized the spot as soon as she looked around her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow we have got here I cannot tell,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with cold civility. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\r\nhave made a complete circuit of Little Hintock. The hazel copse is\r\nquite on the other side. Now we have only to follow the road.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey dragged themselves onward, turned into the lane, passed the track\r\nto Little Hintock, and so reached the park.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere I turn back,\xe2\x80\x9d said Grace, in the same passionless voice. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are\r\nquite near home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Charmond stood inert, seeming appalled by her late admission.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have told you something in a moment of irresistible desire to\r\nunburden my soul which all but a fool would have kept silent as the\r\ngrave,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot help it now. Is it to be a secret\xe2\x80\x94or do you\r\nmean war?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA secret, certainly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Grace, mournfully. \xe2\x80\x9cHow can you expect war\r\nfrom such a helpless, wretched being as I!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xe2\x80\x99ll do my best not to see him. I am his slave; but I\xe2\x80\x99ll try.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrace was naturally kind; but she could not help using a small dagger\r\nnow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray don\xe2\x80\x99t distress yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with exquisitely fine scorn.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may keep him\xe2\x80\x94for me.\xe2\x80\x9d Had she been wounded instead of mortified\r\nshe could not have used the words; but Fitzpiers\xe2\x80\x99s hold upon her heart\r\nwas slight.\r\n\r\nThey parted thus and there, and Grace went moodily homeward. Passing\r\nMarty\xe2\x80\x99s cottage she observed through the window that the girl was\r\nwriting instead of chopping as usual, and wondered what her\r\ncorrespondence could be. Directly afterwards she met people in search\r\nof her, and reached the house to find all in serious alarm. She soon\r\nexplained that she had lost her way, and her general depression was\r\nattributed to exhaustion on that account.\r\n\r\nCould she have known what Marty was writing she would have been\r\nsurprised.\r\n\r\nThe rumor which agitated the other folk of Hintock had reached the\r\nyoung girl, and she was penning a letter to Fitzpiers, to tell him that\r\nMrs. Charmond wore her hair. It was poor Marty\xe2\x80\x99s only card, and she\r\nplayed it, knowing nothing of fashion, and thinking her revelation a\r\nfatal one for a lover.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was at the beginning of April, a few days after the meeting between\r\nGrace and Mrs. Charmond in the wood, that Fitzpiers, just returned from\r\nLondon, was travelling from Sherton-Abbas to Hintock in a hired\r\ncarriage. In his eye there was a doubtful light, and the lines of his\r\nrefined face showed a vague disquietude. He appeared now like one of\r\nthose who impress the beholder as having suffered wrong in being born.\r\n\r\nHis position was in truth gloomy, and to his appreciative mind it\r\nseemed even gloomier than it was. His practice had been slowly\r\ndwindling of late, and now threatened to die out altogether, the\r\nirrepressible old Dr. Jones capturing patients up to Fitzpiers\xe2\x80\x99s very\r\ndoor. Fitzpiers knew only too well the latest and greatest cause of his\r\nunpopularity; and yet, so illogical is man, the second branch of his\r\nsadness grew out of a remedial measure proposed for the first\xe2\x80\x94a letter\r\nfrom Felice Charmond imploring him not to see her again. To bring about\r\ntheir severance still more effectually, she added, she had decided\r\nduring his absence upon almost immediate departure for the Continent.\r\n\r\nThe time was that dull interval in a woodlander\xe2\x80\x99s life which coincides\r\nwith great activity in the life of the woodland itself\xe2\x80\x94a period\r\nfollowing the close of the winter tree-cutting, and preceding the\r\nbarking season, when the saps are just beginning to heave with the\r\nforce of hydraulic lifts inside all the trunks of the forest.\r\n\r\nWinterborne\xe2\x80\x99s contract was completed, and the plantations were\r\ndeserted. It was dusk; there were no leaves as yet; the nightingales\r\nwould not begin to sing for a fortnight; and \xe2\x80\x9cthe Mother of the Months\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwas in her most attenuated phase\xe2\x80\x94starved and bent to a mere bowed\r\nskeleton, which glided along behind the bare twigs in Fitzpiers\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\nWhen he reached home he went straight up to his wife\xe2\x80\x99s sitting-room. He\r\nfound it deserted, and without a fire. He had mentioned no day for his\r\nreturn; nevertheless, he wondered why she was not there waiting to\r\nreceive him. On descending to the other wing of the house and inquiring\r\nof Mrs. Melbury, he learned with much surprise that Grace had gone on a\r\nvisit to an acquaintance at Shottsford-Forum three days earlier; that\r\ntidings had on this morning reached her father of her being very unwell\r\nthere, in consequence of which he had ridden over to see her.\r\n\r\nFitzpiers went up-stairs again, and the little drawing-room, now\r\nlighted by a solitary candle, was not rendered more cheerful by the\r\nentrance of Grammer Oliver with an apronful of wood, which she threw on\r\nthe hearth while she raked out the grate and rattled about the\r\nfire-irons, with a view to making things comfortable. Fitzpiers\r\nconsidered that Grace ought to have let him know her plans more\r\naccurately before leaving home in a freak like this. He went\r\ndesultorily to the window, the blind of which had not been pulled down,\r\nand looked out at the thin, fast-sinking moon, and at the tall stalk of\r\nsmoke rising from the top of Suke Damson\xe2\x80\x99s chimney, signifying that the\r\nyoung woman had just lit her fire to prepare supper.\r\n\r\nHe became conscious of a discussion in progress on the opposite side of\r\nthe court. Somebody had looked over the wall to talk to the sawyers,\r\nand was telling them in a loud voice news in which the name of Mrs.\r\nCharmond soon arrested his ears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGrammer, don\xe2\x80\x99t make so much noise with that grate,\xe2\x80\x9d said the surgeon;\r\nat which Grammer reared herself upon her knees and held the fuel\r\nsuspended in her hand, while Fitzpiers half opened the casement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is off to foreign lands again at last\xe2\x80\x94hev made up her mind quite\r\nsudden-like\xe2\x80\x94and it is thoughted she\xe2\x80\x99ll leave in a day or two. She\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbeen all as if her mind were low for some days past\xe2\x80\x94with a sort of\r\nsorrow in her face, as if she reproached her own soul. She\xe2\x80\x99s the wrong\r\nsort of woman for Hintock\xe2\x80\x94hardly knowing a beech from a woak\xe2\x80\x94that I\r\nown. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t care who the man is, she\xe2\x80\x99s been a very kind friend to\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, the day after to-morrow is the Sabbath day, and without charity\r\nwe are but tinkling simples; but this I do say, that her going will be\r\na blessed thing for a certain married couple who remain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe fire was lighted, and Fitzpiers sat down in front of it, restless\r\nas the last leaf upon a tree. \xe2\x80\x9cA sort of sorrow in her face, as if she\r\nreproached her own soul.\xe2\x80\x9d Poor Felice. How Felice\xe2\x80\x99s frame must be\r\npulsing under the conditions of which he had just heard the caricature;\r\nhow her fair temples must ache; what a mood of wretchedness she must be\r\nin! But for the mixing up of his name with hers, and her determination\r\nto sunder their too close acquaintance on that account, she would\r\nprobably have sent for him professionally. She was now sitting alone,\r\nsuffering, perhaps wishing that she had not forbidden him to come\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nUnable to remain in this lonely room any longer, or to wait for the\r\nmeal which was in course of preparation, he made himself ready for\r\nriding, descended to the yard, stood by the stable-door while Darling\r\nwas being saddled, and rode off down the lane. He would have preferred\r\nwalking, but was weary with his day\xe2\x80\x99s travel.\r\n\r\nAs he approached the door of Marty South\xe2\x80\x99s cottage, which it was\r\nnecessary to pass on his way, she came from the porch as if she had\r\nbeen awaiting him, and met him in the middle of the road, holding up a\r\nletter. Fitzpiers took it without stopping, and asked over his shoulder\r\nfrom whom it came.\r\n\r\nMarty hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cFrom me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, shyly, though with noticeable\r\nfirmness.\r\n\r\nThis letter contained, in fact, Marty\xe2\x80\x99s declaration that she was the\r\noriginal owner of Mrs. Charmond\xe2\x80\x99s supplementary locks, and enclosed a\r\nsample from the native stock, which had grown considerably by this\r\ntime. It was her long contemplated apple of discord, and much her hand\r\ntrembled as she handed the document up to him.\r\n\r\nBut it was impossible on account of the gloom for Fitzpiers to read it\r\nthen, while he had the curiosity to do so, and he put it in his pocket.\r\nHis imagination having already centred itself on Hintock House, in his\r\npocket the letter remained unopened and forgotten, all the while that\r\nMarty was hopefully picturing its excellent weaning effect upon him.\r\n\r\nHe was not long in reaching the precincts of the Manor House. He drew\r\nrein under a group of dark oaks commanding a view of the front, and\r\nreflected a while. His entry would not be altogether unnatural in the\r\ncircumstances of her possible indisposition; but upon the whole he\r\nthought it best to avoid riding up to the door. By silently approaching\r\nhe could retreat unobserved in the event of her not being alone.\r\nThereupon he dismounted, hitched Darling to a stray bough hanging a\r\nlittle below the general browsing line of the trees, and proceeded to\r\nthe door on foot.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time Melbury had returned from Shottsford-Forum. The great\r\ncourt or quadrangle of the timber-merchant\xe2\x80\x99s house, divided from the\r\nshady lane by an ivy-covered wall, was entered by two white gates, one\r\nstanding near each extremity of the wall. It so happened that at the\r\nmoment when Fitzpiers was riding out at the lower gate on his way to\r\nthe Manor House, Melbury was approaching the upper gate to enter it.\r\nFitzpiers being in front of Melbury was seen by the latter, but the\r\nsurgeon, never turning his head, did not observe his father-in-law,\r\nambling slowly and silently along under the trees, though his horse too\r\nwas a gray one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is Grace?\xe2\x80\x9d said his wife, as soon as he entered.\r\n\r\nMelbury looked gloomy. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is not at all well,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like\r\nthe looks of her at all. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear the notion of her biding away\r\nin a strange place any longer, and I begged her to let me get her home.\r\nAt last she agreed to it, but not till after much persuading. I was\r\nthen sorry that I rode over instead of driving; but I have hired a nice\r\ncomfortable carriage\xe2\x80\x94the easiest-going I could get\xe2\x80\x94and she\xe2\x80\x99ll be here\r\nin a couple of hours or less. I rode on ahead to tell you to get her\r\nroom ready; but I see her husband has come back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Melbury. She expressed her concern that her husband\r\nhad hired a carriage all the way from Shottsford. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat it will cost!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care what it costs!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, testily. \xe2\x80\x9cI was determined\r\nto get her home. Why she went away I can\xe2\x80\x99t think! She acts in a way\r\nthat is not at all likely to mend matters as far as I can see.\xe2\x80\x9d (Grace\r\nhad not told her father of her interview with Mrs. Charmond, and the\r\ndisclosure that had been whispered in her startled ear.) \xe2\x80\x9cSince Edgar\r\nis come,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9che might have waited in till I got home, to\r\nask me how she was, if only for a compliment. I saw him go out; where\r\nis he gone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Melbury did not know positively; but she told her husband that\r\nthere was not much doubt about the place of his first visit after an\r\nabsence. She had, in fact, seen Fitzpiers take the direction of the\r\nManor House.\r\n\r\nMelbury said no more. It was exasperating to him that just at this\r\nmoment, when there was every reason for Fitzpiers to stay indoors, or\r\nat any rate to ride along the Shottsford road to meet his ailing wife,\r\nhe should be doing despite to her by going elsewhere. The old man went\r\nout-of-doors again; and his horse being hardly unsaddled as yet, he\r\ntold Upjohn to retighten the girths, when he again mounted, and rode\r\noff at the heels of the surgeon.\r\n\r\nBy the time that Melbury reached the park, he was prepared to go any\r\nlengths in combating this rank and reckless errantry of his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhusband. He would fetch home Edgar Fitzpiers to-night by some means,\r\nrough or fair: in his view there could come of his interference nothing\r\nworse than what existed at present. And yet to every bad there is a\r\nworse.\r\n\r\nHe had entered by the bridle-gate which admitted to the park on this\r\nside, and cantered over the soft turf almost in the tracks of\r\nFitzpiers\xe2\x80\x99s horse, till he reached the clump of trees under which his\r\nprecursor had halted. The whitish object that was indistinctly visible\r\nhere in the gloom of the boughs he found to be Darling, as left by\r\nFitzpiers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x94n him! why did he not ride up to the house in an honest way?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMelbury.\r\n\r\nHe profited by Fitzpiers\xe2\x80\x99s example; dismounting, he tied his horse\r\nunder an adjoining tree, and went on to the house on foot, as the other\r\nhad done. He was no longer disposed to stick at trifles in his\r\ninvestigation, and did not hesitate to gently open the front door\r\nwithout ringing.\r\n\r\nThe large square hall, with its oak floor, staircase, and wainscot, was\r\nlighted by a dim lamp hanging from a beam. Not a soul was visible. He\r\nwent into the corridor and listened at a door which he knew to be that\r\nof the drawing-room; there was no sound, and on turning the handle he\r\nfound the room empty. A fire burning low in the grate was the sole\r\nlight of the apartment; its beams flashed mockingly on the somewhat\r\nshowy Versaillese furniture and gilding here, in style as unlike that\r\nof the structural parts of the building as it was possible to be, and\r\nprobably introduced by Felice to counteract the fine old-English gloom\r\nof the place. Disappointed in his hope of confronting his son-in-law\r\nhere, he went on to the dining-room; this was without light or fire,\r\nand pervaded by a cold atmosphere, which signified that she had not\r\ndined there that day.\r\n\r\nBy this time Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s mood had a little mollified. Everything here was\r\nso pacific, so unaggressive in its repose, that he was no longer\r\nincited to provoke a collision with Fitzpiers or with anybody. The\r\ncomparative stateliness of the apartments influenced him to an emotion,\r\nrather than to a belief, that where all was outwardly so good and\r\nproper there could not be quite that delinquency within which he had\r\nsuspected. It occurred to him, too, that even if his suspicion were\r\njustified, his abrupt, if not unwarrantable, entry into the house might\r\nend in confounding its inhabitant at the expense of his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndignity and his own. Any ill result would be pretty sure to hit Grace\r\nhardest in the long-run. He would, after all, adopt the more rational\r\ncourse, and plead with Fitzpiers privately, as he had pleaded with Mrs.\r\nCharmond.\r\n\r\nHe accordingly retreated as silently as he had come. Passing the door\r\nof the drawing-room anew, he fancied that he heard a noise within which\r\nwas not the crackling of the fire. Melbury gently reopened the door to\r\na distance of a few inches, and saw at the opposite window two figures\r\nin the act of stepping out\xe2\x80\x94a man and a woman\xe2\x80\x94in whom he recognized the\r\nlady of the house and his son-in-law. In a moment they had disappeared\r\namid the gloom of the lawn.\r\n\r\nHe returned into the hall, and let himself out by the carriage-entrance\r\ndoor, coming round to the lawn front in time to see the two figures\r\nparting at the railing which divided the precincts of the house from\r\nthe open park. Mrs. Charmond turned to hasten back immediately that\r\nFitzpiers had left her side, and he was speedily absorbed into the\r\nduskiness of the trees.\r\n\r\nMelbury waited till Mrs. Charmond had re-entered the drawing-room, and\r\nthen followed after Fitzpiers, thinking that he would allow the latter\r\nto mount and ride ahead a little way before overtaking him and giving\r\nhim a piece of his mind. His son-in-law might possibly see the second\r\nhorse near his own; but that would do him no harm, and might prepare\r\nhim for what he was to expect.\r\n\r\nThe event, however, was different from the plan. On plunging into the\r\nthick shade of the clump of oaks, he could not perceive his horse\r\nBlossom anywhere; but feeling his way carefully along, he by-and-by\r\ndiscerned Fitzpiers\xe2\x80\x99s mare Darling still standing as before under the\r\nadjoining tree. For a moment Melbury thought that his own horse, being\r\nyoung and strong, had broken away from her fastening; but on listening\r\nintently he could hear her ambling comfortably along a little way\r\nahead, and a creaking of the saddle which showed that she had a rider.\r\nWalking on as far as the small gate in the corner of the park, he met a\r\nlaborer, who, in reply to Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s inquiry if he had seen any person\r\non a gray horse, said that he had only met Dr. Fitzpiers.\r\n\r\nIt was just what Melbury had begun to suspect: Fitzpiers had mounted\r\nthe mare which did not belong to him in mistake for his own\xe2\x80\x94an\r\noversight easily explicable, in a man ever unwitting in horse-flesh, by\r\nthe darkness of the spot and the near similarity of the animals in\r\nappearance, though Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s was readily enough seen to be the grayer\r\nhorse by day. He hastened back, and did what seemed best in the\r\ncircumstances\xe2\x80\x94got upon old Darling, and rode rapidly after Fitzpiers.\r\n\r\nMelbury had just entered the wood, and was winding along the cart-way\r\nwhich led through it, channelled deep in the leaf-mould with large ruts\r\nthat were formed by the timber-wagons in fetching the spoil of the\r\nplantations, when all at once he descried in front, at a point where\r\nthe road took a turning round a large chestnut-tree, the form of his\r\nown horse Blossom, at which Melbury quickened Darling\xe2\x80\x99s pace, thinking\r\nto come up with Fitzpiers.\r\n\r\nNearer view revealed that the horse had no rider. At Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s approach\r\nit galloped friskily away under the trees in a homeward direction.\r\nThinking something was wrong, the timber-merchant dismounted as soon as\r\nhe reached the chestnut, and after feeling about for a minute or two\r\ndiscovered Fitzpiers lying on the ground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x94help!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the latter as soon as he felt Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s touch; \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nhave been thrown off, but there\xe2\x80\x99s not much harm done, I think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSince Melbury could not now very well read the younger man the lecture\r\nhe had intended, and as friendliness would be hypocrisy, his instinct\r\nwas to speak not a single word to his son-in-law. He raised Fitzpiers\r\ninto a sitting posture, and found that he was a little stunned and\r\nstupefied, but, as he had said, not otherwise hurt. How this fall had\r\ncome about was readily conjecturable: Fitzpiers, imagining there was\r\nonly old Darling under him, had been taken unawares by the younger\r\nhorse\xe2\x80\x99s sprightliness.\r\n\r\nMelbury was a traveller of the old-fashioned sort; having just come\r\nfrom Shottsford-Forum, he still had in his pocket the pilgrim\xe2\x80\x99s flask\r\nof rum which he always carried on journeys exceeding a dozen miles,\r\nthough he seldom drank much of it. He poured it down the surgeon\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthroat, with such effect that he quickly revived. Melbury got him on\r\nhis legs; but the question was what to do with him. He could not walk\r\nmore than a few steps, and the other horse had gone away.\r\n\r\nWith great exertion Melbury contrived to get him astride Darling,\r\nmounting himself behind, and holding Fitzpiers round his waist with one\r\narm. Darling being broad, straight-backed, and high in the withers, was\r\nwell able to carry double, at any rate as far as Hintock, and at a\r\ngentle pace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mare paced along with firm and cautious tread through the copse\r\nwhere Winterborne had worked, and into the heavier soil where the oaks\r\ngrew; past Great Willy, the largest oak in the wood, and thence towards\r\nNellcombe Bottom, intensely dark now with overgrowth, and popularly\r\nsupposed to be haunted by the spirits of the fratricides exorcised from\r\nHintock House.\r\n\r\nBy this time Fitzpiers was quite recovered as to physical strength. But\r\nhe had eaten nothing since making a hasty breakfast in London that\r\nmorning, his anxiety about Felice having hurried him away from home\r\nbefore dining; as a consequence, the old rum administered by his\r\nfather-in-law flew to the young man\xe2\x80\x99s head and loosened his tongue,\r\nwithout his ever having recognized who it was that had lent him a\r\nkindly hand. He began to speak in desultory sentences, Melbury still\r\nsupporting him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve come all the way from London to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fitzpiers. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe place to meet your equals. I live at Hintock\xe2\x80\x94worse, at Little\r\nHintock\xe2\x80\x94and I am quite lost there. There\xe2\x80\x99s not a man within ten miles\r\nof Hintock who can comprehend me. I tell you, Farmer What\xe2\x80\x99s-your-name,\r\nthat I\xe2\x80\x99m a man of education. I know several languages; the poets and I\r\nare familiar friends; I used to read more in metaphysics than anybody\r\nwithin fifty miles; and since I gave that up there\xe2\x80\x99s nobody can match\r\nme in the whole county of Wessex as a scientist. Yet I an doomed to\r\nlive with tradespeople in a miserable little hole like Hintock!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed!\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Melbury.\r\n\r\nFitzpiers, increasingly energized by the alcohol, here reared himself\r\nup suddenly from the bowed posture he had hitherto held, thrusting his\r\nshoulders so violently against Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s breast as to make it difficult\r\nfor the old man to keep a hold on the reins. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople don\xe2\x80\x99t appreciate\r\nme here!\xe2\x80\x9d the surgeon exclaimed; lowering his voice, he added, softly\r\nand slowly, \xe2\x80\x9cexcept one\xe2\x80\x94except one!...A passionate soul, as warm as she\r\nis clever, as beautiful as she is warm, and as rich as she is\r\nbeautiful. I say, old fellow, those claws of yours clutch me rather\r\ntight\xe2\x80\x94rather like the eagle\xe2\x80\x99s, you know, that ate out the liver of\r\nPro\xe2\x80\x94Pre\xe2\x80\x94the man on Mount Caucasus. People don\xe2\x80\x99t appreciate me, I say,\r\nexcept _her!_ Ah, gods, I am an unlucky man! She would have been mine,\r\nshe would have taken my name; but unfortunately it cannot be so. I\r\nstooped to mate beneath me, and now I rue it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe position was becoming a very trying one for Melbury, corporeally\r\nand mentally. He was obliged to steady Fitzpiers with his left arm, and\r\nhe began to hate the contact. He hardly knew what to do. It was useless\r\nto remonstrate with Fitzpiers, in his intellectual confusion from the\r\nrum and from the fall. He remained silent, his hold upon his companion,\r\nhowever, being stern rather than compassionate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou hurt me a little, farmer\xe2\x80\x94though I am much obliged to you for your\r\nkindness. People don\xe2\x80\x99t appreciate me, I say. Between ourselves, I am\r\nlosing my practice here; and why? Because I see matchless attraction\r\nwhere matchless attraction is, both in person and position. I mention\r\nno names, so nobody will be the wiser. But I have lost her, in a\r\nlegitimate sense, that is. If I were a free man now, things have come\r\nto such a pass that she could not refuse me; while with her fortune\r\n(which I don\xe2\x80\x99t covet for itself) I should have a chance of satisfying\r\nan honorable ambition\xe2\x80\x94a chance I have never had yet, and now never,\r\nnever shall have, probably!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMelbury, his heart throbbing against the other\xe2\x80\x99s backbone, and his\r\nbrain on fire with indignation, ventured to mutter huskily, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe horse ambled on some steps before Fitzpiers replied, \xe2\x80\x9cBecause I am\r\ntied and bound to another by law, as tightly as I am to you by your\r\narm\xe2\x80\x94not that I complain of your arm\xe2\x80\x94I thank you for helping me. Well,\r\nwhere are we? Not nearly home yet?...Home, say I. It _is_ a home! When\r\nI might have been at the other house over there.\xe2\x80\x9d In a stupefied way he\r\nflung his hand in the direction of the park. \xe2\x80\x9cI was just two months too\r\nearly in committing myself. Had I only seen the other first\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere the old man\xe2\x80\x99s arm gave Fitzpiers a convulsive shake. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you\r\ndoing?\xe2\x80\x9d continued the latter. \xe2\x80\x9cKeep still, please, or put me down. I\r\nwas saying that I lost her by a mere little two months! There is no\r\nchance for me now in this world, and it makes me reckless\xe2\x80\x94reckless!\r\nUnless, indeed, anything should happen to the other one. She is amiable\r\nenough; but if anything should happen to her\xe2\x80\x94and I hear she is\r\nill\xe2\x80\x94well, if it _should_, I should be free\xe2\x80\x94and my fame, my happiness,\r\nwould be insured.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese were the last words that Fitzpiers uttered in his seat in front\r\nof the timber-merchant. Unable longer to master himself, Melbury, the\r\nskin of his face compressed, whipped away his spare arm from\r\nFitzpiers\xe2\x80\x99s waist, and seized him by the collar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou heartless villain\xe2\x80\x94after all that we have done for ye!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried,\r\nwith a quivering lip. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd the money of hers that you\xe2\x80\x99ve had, and the\r\nroof we\xe2\x80\x99ve provided to shelter ye! It is to me, George Melbury, that\r\nyou dare to talk like that!\xe2\x80\x9d The exclamation was accompanied by a\r\npowerful swing from the shoulder, which flung the young man head-long\r\ninto the road, Fitzpiers fell with a heavy thud upon the stumps of some\r\nundergrowth which had been cut during the winter preceding. Darling\r\ncontinued her walk for a few paces farther and stopped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod forgive me!\xe2\x80\x9d Melbury murmured, repenting of what he had done. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\r\ntried me too sorely; and now perhaps I\xe2\x80\x99ve murdered him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned round in the saddle and looked towards the spot on which\r\nFitzpiers had fallen. To his great surprise he beheld the surgeon rise\r\nto his feet with a bound, as if unhurt, and walk away rapidly under the\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nMelbury listened till the rustle of Fitzpiers\xe2\x80\x99s footsteps died away.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt might have been a crime, but for the mercy of Providence in\r\nproviding leaves for his fall,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself. And then his mind\r\nreverted to the words of Fitzpiers, and his indignation so mounted\r\nwithin him that he almost wished the fall had put an end to the young\r\nman there and then.\r\n\r\nHe had not ridden far when he discerned his own gray mare standing\r\nunder some bushes. Leaving Darling for a moment, Melbury went forward\r\nand easily caught the younger animal, now disheartened at its freak. He\r\nthen made the pair of them fast to a tree, and turning back, endeavored\r\nto find some trace of Fitzpiers, feeling pitifully that, after all, he\r\nhad gone further than he intended with the offender.\r\n\r\nBut though he threaded the wood hither and thither, his toes ploughing\r\nlayer after layer of the little horny scrolls that had once been\r\nleaves, he could not find him. He stood still listening and looking\r\nround. The breeze was oozing through the network of boughs as through a\r\nstrainer; the trunks and larger branches stood against the light of the\r\nsky in the forms of writhing men, gigantic candelabra, pikes, halberds,\r\nlances, and whatever besides the fancy chose to make of them. Giving up\r\nthe search, Melbury came back to the horses, and walked slowly\r\nhomeward, leading one in each hand.\r\n\r\nIt happened that on this self-same evening a boy had been returning\r\nfrom Great to Little Hintock about the time of Fitzpiers\xe2\x80\x99s and\r\nMelbury\xe2\x80\x99s passage home along that route. A horse-collar that had been\r\nleft at the harness-mender\xe2\x80\x99s to be repaired was required for use at\r\nfive o\xe2\x80\x99clock next morning, and in consequence the boy had to fetch it\r\novernight. He put his head through the collar, and accompanied his walk\r\nby whistling the one tune he knew, as an antidote to fear.\r\n\r\nThe boy suddenly became aware of a horse trotting rather friskily along\r\nthe track behind him, and not knowing whether to expect friend or foe,\r\nprudence suggested that he should cease his whistling and retreat among\r\nthe trees till the horse and his rider had gone by; a course to which\r\nhe was still more inclined when he found how noiselessly they\r\napproached, and saw that the horse looked pale, and remembered what he\r\nhad read about Death in the Revelation. He therefore deposited the\r\ncollar by a tree, and hid himself behind it. The horseman came on, and\r\nthe youth, whose eyes were as keen as telescopes, to his great relief\r\nrecognized the doctor.\r\n\r\nAs Melbury surmised, Fitzpiers had in the darkness taken Blossom for\r\nDarling, and he had not discovered his mistake when he came up opposite\r\nthe boy, though he was somewhat surprised at the liveliness of his\r\nusually placid mare. The only other pair of eyes on the spot whose\r\nvision was keen as the young carter\xe2\x80\x99s were those of the horse; and,\r\nwith that strongly conservative objection to the unusual which animals\r\nshow, Blossom, on eying the collar under the tree\xe2\x80\x94quite invisible to\r\nFitzpiers\xe2\x80\x94exercised none of the patience of the older horse, but shied\r\nsufficiently to unseat so second-rate an equestrian as the surgeon.\r\n\r\nHe fell, and did not move, lying as Melbury afterwards found him. The\r\nboy ran away, salving his conscience for the desertion by thinking how\r\nvigorously he would spread the alarm of the accident when he got to\r\nHintock\xe2\x80\x94which he uncompromisingly did, incrusting the skeleton event\r\nwith a load of dramatic horrors.\r\n\r\nGrace had returned, and the fly hired on her account, though not by her\r\nhusband, at the Crown Hotel, Shottsford-Forum, had been paid for and\r\ndismissed. The long drive had somewhat revived her, her illness being a\r\nfeverish intermittent nervousness which had more to do with mind than\r\nbody, and she walked about her sitting-room in something of a hopeful\r\nmood. Mrs. Melbury had told her as soon as she arrived that her husband\r\nhad returned from London. He had gone out, she said, to see a patient,\r\nas she supposed, and he must soon be back, since he had had no dinner\r\nor tea. Grace would not allow her mind to harbor any suspicion of his\r\nwhereabouts, and her step-mother said nothing of Mrs. Charmond\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrumored sorrows and plans of departure.\r\n\r\nSo the young wife sat by the fire, waiting silently. She had left\r\nHintock in a turmoil of feeling after the revelation of Mrs. Charmond,\r\nand had intended not to be at home when her husband returned. But she\r\nhad thought the matter over, and had allowed her father\xe2\x80\x99s influence to\r\nprevail and bring her back; and now somewhat regretted that Edgar\xe2\x80\x99s\r\narrival had preceded hers.\r\n\r\nBy-and-by Mrs. Melbury came up-stairs with a slight air of flurry and\r\nabruptness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have something to tell\xe2\x80\x94some bad news,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you must not\r\nbe alarmed, as it is not so bad as it might have been. Edgar has been\r\nthrown off his horse. We don\xe2\x80\x99t think he is hurt much. It happened in\r\nthe wood the other side of Nellcombe Bottom, where \xe2\x80\x99tis said the ghosts\r\nof the brothers walk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe went on to give a few of the particulars, but none of the invented\r\nhorrors that had been communicated by the boy. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought it better to\r\ntell you at once,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, \xe2\x80\x9cin case he should not be very well able\r\nto walk home, and somebody should bring him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Melbury really thought matters much worse than she represented,\r\nand Grace knew that she thought so. She sat down dazed for a few\r\nminutes, returning a negative to her step-mother\xe2\x80\x99s inquiry if she could\r\ndo anything for her. \xe2\x80\x9cBut please go into the bedroom,\xe2\x80\x9d Grace said, on\r\nsecond thoughts, \xe2\x80\x9cand see if all is ready there\xe2\x80\x94in case it is serious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nMrs. Melbury thereupon called Grammer, and they did as directed,\r\nsupplying the room with everything they could think of for the\r\naccommodation of an injured man.\r\n\r\nNobody was left in the lower part of the house. Not many minutes passed\r\nwhen Grace heard a knock at the door\xe2\x80\x94a single knock, not loud enough to\r\nreach the ears of those in the bedroom. She went to the top of the\r\nstairs and said, faintly, \xe2\x80\x9cCome up,\xe2\x80\x9d knowing that the door stood, as\r\nusual in such houses, wide open.\r\n\r\nRetreating into the gloom of the broad landing she saw rise up the\r\nstairs a woman whom at first she did not recognize, till her voice\r\nrevealed her to be Suke Damson, in great fright and sorrow. A streak of\r\nlight from the partially closed door of Grace\xe2\x80\x99s room fell upon her face\r\nas she came forward, and it was drawn and pale.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Miss Melbury\xe2\x80\x94I would say Mrs. Fitzpiers,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, wringing her\r\nhands. \xe2\x80\x9cThis terrible news. Is he dead? Is he hurted very bad? Tell me;\r\nI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help coming; please forgive me, Miss Melbury\xe2\x80\x94Mrs. Fitzpiers\r\nI would say!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrace sank down on the oak chest which stood on the landing, and put\r\nher hands to her now flushed face and head. Could she order Suke Damson\r\ndown-stairs and out of the house? Her husband might be brought in at\r\nany moment, and what would happen? But could she order this genuinely\r\ngrieved woman away?\r\n\r\nThere was a dead silence of half a minute or so, till Suke said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t ye speak? Is he here? Is he dead? If so, why can\xe2\x80\x99t I see\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x94would it be so very wrong?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore Grace had answered somebody else came to the door below\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nfoot-fall light as a roe\xe2\x80\x99s. There was a hurried tapping upon the panel,\r\nas if with the impatient tips of fingers whose owner thought not\r\nwhether a knocker were there or no. Without a pause, and possibly\r\nguided by the stray beam of light on the landing, the newcomer ascended\r\nthe staircase as the first had done. Grace was sufficiently visible,\r\nand the lady, for a lady it was, came to her side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could make nobody hear down-stairs,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felice Charmond, with lips\r\nwhose dryness could almost be heard, and panting, as she stood like one\r\nready to sink on the floor with distress. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is\xe2\x80\x94the matter\xe2\x80\x94tell me\r\nthe worst! Can he live?\xe2\x80\x9d She looked at Grace imploringly, without\r\nperceiving poor Suke, who, dismayed at such a presence, had shrunk away\r\ninto the shade.\r\n\r\nMrs. Charmond\xe2\x80\x99s little feet were covered with mud; she was quite\r\nunconscious of her appearance now. \xe2\x80\x9cI have heard such a dreadful\r\nreport,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on; \xe2\x80\x9cI came to ascertain the truth of it. Is\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x94killed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe won\xe2\x80\x99t tell us\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s dying\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s in that room!\xe2\x80\x9d burst out Suke,\r\nregardless of consequences, as she heard the distant movements of Mrs.\r\nMelbury and Grammer in the bedroom at the end of the passage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Charmond; and on Suke pointing out the direction,\r\nshe made as if to go thither.\r\n\r\nGrace barred the way. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is not there,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI have not seen him\r\nany more than you. I have heard a report only\xe2\x80\x94not so bad as you think.\r\nIt must have been exaggerated to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease do not conceal anything\xe2\x80\x94let me know all!\xe2\x80\x9d said Felice,\r\ndoubtingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall know all I know\xe2\x80\x94you have a perfect right to know\xe2\x80\x94who can\r\nhave a better than either of you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Grace, with a delicate sting\r\nwhich was lost upon Felice Charmond now. \xe2\x80\x9cI repeat, I have only heard a\r\nless alarming account than you have heard; how much it means, and how\r\nlittle, I cannot say. I pray God that it means not much\xe2\x80\x94in common\r\nhumanity. You probably pray the same\xe2\x80\x94_for other reasons_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe regarded them both there in the dim light a while.\r\n\r\nThey stood dumb in their trouble, not stinging back at her; not heeding\r\nher mood. A tenderness spread over Grace like a dew. It was well, very\r\nwell, conventionally, to address either one of them in the wife\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nregulation terms of virtuous sarcasm, as woman, creature, or thing, for\r\nlosing their hearts to her husband. But life, what was it, and who was\r\nshe? She had, like the singer of the psalm of Asaph, been plagued and\r\nchastened all the day long; but could she, by retributive words, in\r\norder to please herself\xe2\x80\x94the individual\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9coffend against the generation,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nas he would not?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is dying, perhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d blubbered Suke Damson, putting her apron to her\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nIn their gestures and faces there were anxieties, affection, agony of\r\nheart, all for a man who had wronged them\xe2\x80\x94had never really behaved\r\ntowards either of them anyhow but selfishly. Neither one but would have\r\nwellnigh sacrificed half her life to him, even now. The tears which his\r\npossibly critical situation could not bring to her eyes surged over at\r\nthe contemplation of these fellow-women. She turned to the balustrade,\r\nbent herself upon it, and wept.\r\n\r\nThereupon Felice began to cry also, without using her handkerchief, and\r\nletting the tears run down silently. While these three poor women stood\r\ntogether thus, pitying another though most to be pitied themselves, the\r\npacing of a horse or horses became audible in the court, and in a\r\nmoment Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s voice was heard calling to his stableman. Grace at\r\nonce started up, ran down the stairs and out into the quadrangle as her\r\nfather crossed it towards the door. \xe2\x80\x9cFather, what is the matter with\r\nhim?\xe2\x80\x9d she cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x94Edgar?\xe2\x80\x9d said Melbury, abruptly. \xe2\x80\x9cMatter? Nothing. What, my dear,\r\nand have you got home safe? Why, you are better already! But you ought\r\nnot to be out in the air like this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he has been thrown off his horse!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know; I know. I saw it. He got up again, and walked off as well as\r\never. A fall on the leaves didn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt a spry fellow like him. He did\r\nnot come this way,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, significantly. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose he went to look\r\nfor his horse. I tried to find him, but could not. But after seeing him\r\ngo away under the trees I found the horse, and have led it home for\r\nsafety. So he must walk. Now, don\xe2\x80\x99t you stay out here in this night\r\nair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe returned to the house with her father. When she had again ascended\r\nto the landing and to her own rooms beyond it was a great relief to her\r\nto find that both Petticoat the First and Petticoat the Second of her\r\n_Bien-aim\xc3\xa9_ had silently disappeared. They had, in all probability,\r\nheard the words of her father, and departed with their anxieties\r\nrelieved.\r\n\r\nPresently her parents came up to Grace, and busied themselves to see\r\nthat she was comfortable. Perceiving soon that she would prefer to be\r\nleft alone they went away.\r\n\r\nGrace waited on. The clock raised its voice now and then, but her\r\nhusband did not return. At her father\xe2\x80\x99s usual hour for retiring he\r\nagain came in to see her. \xe2\x80\x9cDo not stay up,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, as soon as he\r\nentered. \xe2\x80\x9cI am not at all tired. I will sit up for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think it will be useless, Grace,\xe2\x80\x9d said Melbury, slowly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have had a bitter quarrel with him; and on that account I hardly\r\nthink he will return to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA quarrel? Was that after the fall seen by the boy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMelbury nodded an affirmative, without taking his eyes off the candle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; it was as we were coming home together,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nSomething had been swelling up in Grace while her father was speaking.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow could you want to quarrel with him?\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, suddenly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy\r\ncould you not let him come home quietly if he were inclined to? He is\r\nmy husband; and now you have married me to him surely you need not\r\nprovoke him unnecessarily. First you induce me to accept him, and then\r\nyou do things that divide us more than we should naturally be divided!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can you speak so unjustly to me, Grace?\xe2\x80\x9d said Melbury, with\r\nindignant sorrow. \xe2\x80\x9c_I_ divide you from your husband, indeed! You little\r\nthink\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was inclined to say more\xe2\x80\x94to tell her the whole story of the\r\nencounter, and that the provocation he had received had lain entirely\r\nin hearing her despised. But it would have greatly distressed her, and\r\nhe forbore. \xe2\x80\x9cYou had better lie down. You are tired,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\nsoothingly. \xe2\x80\x9cGood-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe household went to bed, and a silence fell upon the dwelling, broken\r\nonly by the occasional skirr of a halter in Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s stables. Despite\r\nher father\xe2\x80\x99s advice Grace still waited up. But nobody came.\r\n\r\nIt was a critical time in Grace\xe2\x80\x99s emotional life that night. She\r\nthought of her husband a good deal, and for the nonce forgot\r\nWinterborne.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow these unhappy women must have admired Edgar!\xe2\x80\x9d she said to herself.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow attractive he must be to everybody; and, indeed, he is\r\nattractive.\xe2\x80\x9d The possibility is that, piqued by rivalry, these ideas\r\nmight have been transformed into their corresponding emotions by a show\r\nof the least reciprocity in Fitzpiers. There was, in truth, a love-bird\r\nyearning to fly from her heart; and it wanted a lodging badly.\r\n\r\nBut no husband came. The fact was that Melbury had been much mistaken\r\nabout the condition of Fitzpiers. People do not fall headlong on stumps\r\nof underwood with impunity. Had the old man been able to watch\r\nFitzpiers narrowly enough, he would have observed that on rising and\r\nwalking into the thicket he dropped blood as he went; that he had not\r\nproceeded fifty yards before he showed signs of being dizzy, and,\r\nraising his hands to his head, reeled and fell down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nGrace was not the only one who watched and meditated in Hintock that\r\nnight. Felice Charmond was in no mood to retire to rest at a customary\r\nhour; and over her drawing-room fire at the Manor House she sat as\r\nmotionless and in as deep a reverie as Grace in her little apartment at\r\nthe homestead.\r\n\r\nHaving caught ear of Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s intelligence while she stood on the\r\nlanding at his house, and been eased of much of her mental distress,\r\nher sense of personal decorum returned upon her with a rush. She\r\ndescended the stairs and left the door like a ghost, keeping close to\r\nthe walls of the building till she got round to the gate of the\r\nquadrangle, through which she noiselessly passed almost before Grace\r\nand her father had finished their discourse. Suke Damson had thought it\r\nwell to imitate her superior in this respect, and, descending the back\r\nstairs as Felice descended the front, went out at the side door and\r\nhome to her cottage.\r\n\r\nOnce outside Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s gates Mrs. Charmond ran with all her speed to\r\nthe Manor House, without stopping or turning her head, and splitting\r\nher thin boots in her haste. She entered her own dwelling, as she had\r\nemerged from it, by the drawing-room window. In other circumstances she\r\nwould have felt some timidity at undertaking such an unpremeditated\r\nexcursion alone; but her anxiety for another had cast out her fear for\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nEverything in her drawing-room was just as she had left it\xe2\x80\x94the candles\r\nstill burning, the casement closed, and the shutters gently pulled to,\r\nso as to hide the state of the window from the cursory glance of a\r\nservant entering the apartment. She had been gone about three-quarters\r\nof an hour by the clock, and nobody seemed to have discovered her\r\nabsence. Tired in body but tense in mind, she sat down, palpitating,\r\nround-eyed, bewildered at what she had done.\r\n\r\nShe had been betrayed by affrighted love into a visit which, now that\r\nthe emotion instigating it had calmed down under her belief that\r\nFitzpiers was in no danger, was the saddest surprise to her. This was\r\nhow she had set about doing her best to escape her passionate bondage\r\nto him! Somehow, in declaring to Grace and to herself the unseemliness\r\nof her infatuation, she had grown a convert to its irresistibility. If\r\nHeaven would only give her strength; but Heaven never did! One thing\r\nwas indispensable; she must go away from Hintock if she meant to\r\nwithstand further temptation. The struggle was too wearying, too\r\nhopeless, while she remained. It was but a continual capitulation of\r\nconscience to what she dared not name.\r\n\r\nBy degrees, as she sat, Felice\xe2\x80\x99s mind\xe2\x80\x94helped perhaps by the anticlimax\r\nof learning that her lover was unharmed after all her fright about\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x94grew wondrously strong in wise resolve. For the moment she was in a\r\nmood, in the words of Mrs. Elizabeth Montagu, \xe2\x80\x9cto run mad with\r\ndiscretion;\xe2\x80\x9d and was so persuaded that discretion lay in departure that\r\nshe wished to set about going that very minute. Jumping up from her\r\nseat, she began to gather together some small personal knick-knacks\r\nscattered about the room, to feel that preparations were really in\r\ntrain.\r\n\r\nWhile moving here and there she fancied that she heard a slight noise\r\nout-of-doors, and stood still. Surely it was a tapping at the window. A\r\nthought entered her mind, and burned her cheek. He had come to that\r\nwindow before; yet was it possible that he should dare to do so now!\r\nAll the servants were in bed, and in the ordinary course of affairs she\r\nwould have retired also. Then she remembered that on stepping in by the\r\ncasement and closing it, she had not fastened the window-shutter, so\r\nthat a streak of light from the interior of the room might have\r\nrevealed her vigil to an observer on the lawn. How all things conspired\r\nagainst her keeping faith with Grace!\r\n\r\nThe tapping recommenced, light as from the bill of a little bird; her\r\nillegitimate hope overcame her vow; she went and pulled back the\r\nshutter, determining, however, to shake her head at him and keep the\r\ncasement securely closed.\r\n\r\nWhat she saw outside might have struck terror into a heart stouter than\r\na helpless woman\xe2\x80\x99s at midnight. In the centre of the lowest pane of the\r\nwindow, close to the glass, was a human face, which she barely\r\nrecognized as the face of Fitzpiers. It was surrounded with the\r\ndarkness of the night without, corpse-like in its pallor, and covered\r\nwith blood. As disclosed in the square area of the pane it met her\r\nfrightened eyes like a replica of the Sudarium of St. Veronica.\r\n\r\nHe moved his lips, and looked at her imploringly. Her rapid mind pieced\r\ntogether in an instant a possible concatenation of events which might\r\nhave led to this tragical issue. She unlatched the casement with a\r\nterrified hand, and bending down to where he was crouching, pressed her\r\nface to his with passionate solicitude. She assisted him into the room\r\nwithout a word, to do which it was almost necessary to lift him bodily.\r\nQuickly closing the window and fastening the shutters, she bent over\r\nhim breathlessly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you hurt much\xe2\x80\x94much?\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, faintly. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, oh, how is this!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRather much\xe2\x80\x94but don\xe2\x80\x99t be frightened,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered in a difficult\r\nwhisper, and turning himself to obtain an easier position if possible.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA little water, please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe ran across into the dining-room, and brought a bottle and glass,\r\nfrom which he eagerly drank. He could then speak much better, and with\r\nher help got upon the nearest couch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you dying, Edgar?\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cDo speak to me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am half dead,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fitzpiers. \xe2\x80\x9cBut perhaps I shall get over\r\nit....It is chiefly loss of blood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I thought your fall did not hurt you,\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cWho did this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFelice\xe2\x80\x94my father-in-law!...I have crawled to you more than a mile on\r\nmy hands and knees\xe2\x80\x94God, I thought I should never have got here!...I\r\nhave come to you\xe2\x80\x94be-cause you are the only friend\xe2\x80\x94I have in the world\r\nnow....I can never go back to Hintock\xe2\x80\x94never\xe2\x80\x94to the roof of the\r\nMelburys! Not poppy nor mandragora will ever medicine this bitter\r\nfeud!...If I were only well again\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me bind your head, now that you have rested.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94but wait a moment\xe2\x80\x94it has stopped bleeding, fortunately, or I\r\nshould be a dead man before now. While in the wood I managed to make a\r\ntourniquet of some half-pence and my handkerchief, as well as I could\r\nin the dark....But listen, dear Felice! Can you hide me till I am well?\r\nWhatever comes, I can be seen in Hintock no more. My practice is nearly\r\ngone, you know\xe2\x80\x94and after this I would not care to recover it if I\r\ncould.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy this time Felice\xe2\x80\x99s tears began to blind her. Where were now her\r\ndiscreet plans for sundering their lives forever? To administer to him\r\nin his pain, and trouble, and poverty, was her single thought. The\r\nfirst step was to hide him, and she asked herself where. A place\r\noccurred to her mind.\r\n\r\nShe got him some wine from the dining-room, which strengthened him\r\nmuch. Then she managed to remove his boots, and, as he could now keep\r\nhimself upright by leaning upon her on one side and a walking-stick on\r\nthe other, they went thus in slow march out of the room and up the\r\nstairs. At the top she took him along a gallery, pausing whenever he\r\nrequired rest, and thence up a smaller staircase to the least used part\r\nof the house, where she unlocked a door. Within was a lumber-room,\r\ncontaining abandoned furniture of all descriptions, built up in piles\r\nwhich obscured the light of the windows, and formed between them nooks\r\nand lairs in which a person would not be discerned even should an eye\r\ngaze in at the door. The articles were mainly those that had belonged\r\nto the previous owner of the house, and had been bought in by the late\r\nMr. Charmond at the auction; but changing fashion, and the tastes of a\r\nyoung wife, had caused them to be relegated to this dungeon.\r\n\r\nHere Fitzpiers sat on the floor against the wall till she had hauled\r\nout materials for a bed, which she spread on the floor in one of the\r\naforesaid nooks. She obtained water and a basin, and washed the dried\r\nblood from his face and hands; and when he was comfortably reclining,\r\nfetched food from the larder. While he ate her eyes lingered anxiously\r\non his face, following its every movement with such loving-kindness as\r\nonly a fond woman can show.\r\n\r\nHe was now in better condition, and discussed his position with her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I fancy I said to Melbury must have been enough to enrage any\r\nman, if uttered in cold blood, and with knowledge of his presence. But\r\nI did not know him, and I was stupefied by what he had given me, so\r\nthat I hardly was aware of what I said. Well\xe2\x80\x94the veil of that temple is\r\nrent in twain!...As I am not going to be seen again in Hintock, my\r\nfirst efforts must be directed to allay any alarm that may be felt at\r\nmy absence, before I am able to get clear away. Nobody must suspect\r\nthat I have been hurt, or there will be a country talk about me.\r\nFelice, I must at once concoct a letter to check all search for me. I\r\nthink if you can bring me a pen and paper I may be able to do it now. I\r\ncould rest better if it were done. Poor thing! how I tire her with\r\nrunning up and down!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe fetched writing materials, and held up the blotting-book as a\r\nsupport to his hand, while he penned a brief note to his nominal wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe animosity shown towards me by your father,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote, in this\r\ncoldest of marital epistles, \xe2\x80\x9cis such that I cannot return again to a\r\nroof which is his, even though it shelters you. A parting is\r\nunavoidable, as you are sure to be on his side in this division. I am\r\nstarting on a journey which will take me a long way from Hintock, and\r\nyou must not expect to see me there again for some time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe then gave her a few directions bearing upon his professional\r\nengagements and other practical matters, concluding without a hint of\r\nhis destination, or a notion of when she would see him again. He\r\noffered to read the note to Felice before he closed it up, but she\r\nwould not hear or see it; that side of his obligations distressed her\r\nbeyond endurance. She turned away from Fitzpiers, and sobbed bitterly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you can get this posted at a place some miles away,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered,\r\nexhausted by the effort of writing\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cat Shottsford or Port-Bredy, or\r\nstill better, Budmouth\xe2\x80\x94it will divert all suspicion from this house as\r\nthe place of my refuge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will drive to one or other of the places myself\xe2\x80\x94anything to keep it\r\nunknown,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured, her voice weighted with vague foreboding, now\r\nthat the excitement of helping him had passed away.\r\n\r\nFitzpiers told her that there was yet one thing more to be done. \xe2\x80\x9cIn\r\ncreeping over the fence on to the lawn,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI made the rail\r\nbloody, and it shows rather much on the white paint\xe2\x80\x94I could see it in\r\nthe dark. At all hazards it should be washed off. Could you do that\r\nalso, Felice?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat will not women do on such devoted occasions? weary as she was she\r\nwent all the way down the rambling staircases to the ground-floor, then\r\nto search for a lantern, which she lighted and hid under her cloak;\r\nthen for a wet sponge, and next went forth into the night. The white\r\nrailing stared out in the darkness at her approach, and a ray from the\r\nenshrouded lantern fell upon the blood\xe2\x80\x94just where he had told her it\r\nwould be found. She shuddered. It was almost too much to bear in one\r\nday\xe2\x80\x94but with a shaking hand she sponged the rail clean, and returned to\r\nthe house.\r\n\r\nThe time occupied by these several proceedings was not much less than\r\ntwo hours. When all was done, and she had smoothed his extemporized\r\nbed, and placed everything within his reach that she could think of,\r\nshe took her leave of him, and locked him in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen her husband\xe2\x80\x99s letter reached Grace\xe2\x80\x99s hands, bearing upon it the\r\npostmark of a distant town, it never once crossed her mind that\r\nFitzpiers was within a mile of her still. She felt relieved that he did\r\nnot write more bitterly of the quarrel with her father, whatever its\r\nnature might have been; but the general frigidity of his communication\r\nquenched in her the incipient spark that events had kindled so shortly\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nFrom this centre of information it was made known in Hintock that the\r\ndoctor had gone away, and as none but the Melbury household was aware\r\nthat he did not return on the night of his accident, no excitement\r\nmanifested itself in the village.\r\n\r\nThus the early days of May passed by. None but the nocturnal birds and\r\nanimals observed that late one evening, towards the middle of the\r\nmonth, a closely wrapped figure, with a crutch under one arm and a\r\nstick in his hand, crept out from Hintock House across the lawn to the\r\nshelter of the trees, taking thence a slow and laborious walk to the\r\nnearest point of the turnpike-road. The mysterious personage was so\r\ndisguised that his own wife would hardly have known him. Felice\r\nCharmond was a practised hand at make-ups, as well she might be; and\r\nshe had done her utmost in padding and painting Fitzpiers with the old\r\nmaterials of her art in the recesses of the lumber-room.\r\n\r\nIn the highway he was met by a covered carriage, which conveyed him to\r\nSherton-Abbas, whence he proceeded to the nearest port on the south\r\ncoast, and immediately crossed the Channel.\r\n\r\nBut it was known to everybody that three days after this time Mrs.\r\nCharmond executed her long-deferred plan of setting out for a long term\r\nof travel and residence on the Continent. She went off one morning as\r\nunostentatiously as could be, and took no maid with her, having, she\r\nsaid, engaged one to meet her at a point farther on in her route. After\r\nthat, Hintock House, so frequently deserted, was again to be let.\r\nSpring had not merged in summer when a clinching rumor, founded on the\r\nbest of evidence, reached the parish and neighborhood. Mrs. Charmond\r\nand Fitzpiers had been seen together in Baden, in relations which set\r\nat rest the question that had agitated the little community ever since\r\nthe winter.\r\n\r\nMelbury had entered the Valley of Humiliation even farther than Grace.\r\nHis spirit seemed broken.\r\n\r\nBut once a week he mechanically went to market as usual, and here, as\r\nhe was passing by the conduit one day, his mental condition expressed\r\nlargely by his gait, he heard his name spoken by a voice formerly\r\nfamiliar. He turned and saw a certain Fred Beaucock\xe2\x80\x94once a promising\r\nlawyer\xe2\x80\x99s clerk and local dandy, who had been called the cleverest\r\nfellow in Sherton, without whose brains the firm of solicitors\r\nemploying him would be nowhere. But later on Beaucock had fallen into\r\nthe mire. He was invited out a good deal, sang songs at agricultural\r\nmeetings and burgesses\xe2\x80\x99 dinners; in sum, victualled himself with\r\nspirits more frequently than was good for the clever brains or body\r\neither. He lost his situation, and after an absence spent in trying his\r\npowers elsewhere, came back to his native town, where, at the time of\r\nthe foregoing events in Hintock, he gave legal advice for astonishingly\r\nsmall fees\xe2\x80\x94mostly carrying on his profession on public-house settles,\r\nin whose recesses he might often have been overheard making\r\ncountry-people\xe2\x80\x99s wills for half a crown; calling with a learned voice\r\nfor pen-and-ink and a halfpenny sheet of paper, on which he drew up the\r\ntestament while resting it in a little space wiped with his hand on the\r\ntable amid the liquid circles formed by the cups and glasses. An idea\r\nimplanted early in life is difficult to uproot, and many elderly\r\ntradespeople still clung to the notion that Fred Beaucock knew a great\r\ndeal of law.\r\n\r\nIt was he who had called Melbury by name. \xe2\x80\x9cYou look very down, Mr.\r\nMelbury\xe2\x80\x94very, if I may say as much,\xe2\x80\x9d he observed, when the\r\ntimber-merchant turned. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I know\xe2\x80\x94I know. A very sad case\xe2\x80\x94very. I was\r\nbred to the law, as you know, and am professionally no stranger to such\r\nmatters. Well, Mrs. Fitzpiers has her remedy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x94what\xe2\x80\x94a remedy?\xe2\x80\x9d said Melbury.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnder the new law, sir. A new court was established last year, and\r\nunder the new statute, twenty and twenty-one Vic., cap. eighty-five,\r\nunmarrying is as easy as marrying. No more Acts of Parliament\r\nnecessary; no longer one law for the rich and another for the poor. But\r\ncome inside\xe2\x80\x94I was just going to have a nibleykin of rum hot\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nexplain it all to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe intelligence amazed Melbury, who saw little of newspapers. And\r\nthough he was a severely correct man in his habits, and had no taste\r\nfor entering a tavern with Fred Beaucock\xe2\x80\x94nay, would have been quite\r\nuninfluenced by such a character on any other matter in the world\xe2\x80\x94such\r\nfascination lay in the idea of delivering his poor girl from bondage,\r\nthat it deprived him of the critical faculty. He could not resist the\r\nex-lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s clerk, and entered the inn.\r\n\r\nHere they sat down to the rum, which Melbury paid for as a matter of\r\ncourse, Beaucock leaning back in the settle with a legal gravity which\r\nwould hardly allow him to be conscious of the spirits before him,\r\nthough they nevertheless disappeared with mysterious quickness.\r\n\r\nHow much of the exaggerated information on the then new divorce laws\r\nwhich Beaucock imparted to his listener was the result of ignorance,\r\nand how much of dupery, was never ascertained. But he related such a\r\nplausible story of the ease with which Grace could become a free woman\r\nthat her father was irradiated with the project; and though he scarcely\r\nwetted his lips, Melbury never knew how he came out of the inn, or when\r\nor where he mounted his gig to pursue his way homeward. But home he\r\nfound himself, his brain having all the way seemed to ring sonorously\r\nas a gong in the intensity of its stir. Before he had seen Grace, he\r\nwas accidentally met by Winterborne, who found his face shining as if\r\nhe had, like the Law-giver, conversed with an angel.\r\n\r\nHe relinquished his horse, and took Winterborne by the arm to a heap of\r\nrendlewood\xe2\x80\x94as barked oak was here called\xe2\x80\x94which lay under a\r\nprivet-hedge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGiles,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, when they had sat down upon the logs, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s a new\r\nlaw in the land! Grace can be free quite easily. I only knew it by the\r\nmerest accident. I might not have found it out for the next ten years.\r\nShe can get rid of him\xe2\x80\x94d\xe2\x80\x99ye hear?\xe2\x80\x94get rid of him. Think of that, my\r\nfriend Giles!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe related what he had learned of the new legal remedy. A subdued\r\ntremulousness about the mouth was all the response that Winterborne\r\nmade; and Melbury added, \xe2\x80\x9cMy boy, you shall have her yet\xe2\x80\x94if you want\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x9d His feelings had gathered volume as he said this, and the\r\narticulate sound of the old idea drowned his sight in mist.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you sure\xe2\x80\x94about this new law?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Winterborne, so disquieted by\r\na gigantic exultation which loomed alternately with fearful doubt that\r\nhe evaded the full acceptance of Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s last statement.\r\n\r\nMelbury said that he had no manner of doubt, for since his talk with\r\nBeaucock it had come into his mind that he had seen some time ago in\r\nthe weekly paper an allusion to such a legal change; but, having no\r\ninterest in those desperate remedies at the moment, he had passed it\r\nover. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to let the matter rest doubtful for a single\r\nday,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued. \xe2\x80\x9cI am going to London. Beaucock will go with me,\r\nand we shall get the best advice as soon as we possibly can. Beaucock\r\nis a thorough lawyer\xe2\x80\x94nothing the matter with him but a fiery palate. I\r\nknew him as the stay and refuge of Sherton in knots of law at one\r\ntime.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWinterborne\xe2\x80\x99s replies were of the vaguest. The new possibility was\r\nalmost unthinkable by him at the moment. He was what was called at\r\nHintock \xe2\x80\x9ca solid-going fellow;\xe2\x80\x9d he maintained his abeyant mood, not\r\nfrom want of reciprocity, but from a taciturn hesitancy, taught by life\r\nas he knew it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the timber-merchant, a temporary crease or two of\r\nanxiety supplementing those already established in his forehead by time\r\nand care, \xe2\x80\x9cGrace is not at all well. Nothing constitutional, you know;\r\nbut she has been in a low, nervous state ever since that night of\r\nfright. I don\xe2\x80\x99t doubt but that she will be all right soon....I wonder\r\nhow she is this evening?\xe2\x80\x9d He rose with the words, as if he had too long\r\nforgotten her personality in the excitement of her previsioned career.\r\n\r\nThey had sat till the evening was beginning to dye the garden brown,\r\nand now went towards Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s house, Giles a few steps in the rear of\r\nhis old friend, who was stimulated by the enthusiasm of the moment to\r\noutstep the ordinary walking of Winterborne. He felt shy of entering\r\nGrace\xe2\x80\x99s presence as her reconstituted lover\xe2\x80\x94which was how her father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmanner would be sure to present him\xe2\x80\x94before definite information as to\r\nher future state was forthcoming; it seemed too nearly like the act of\r\nthose who rush in where angels fear to tread.\r\n\r\nA chill to counterbalance all the glowing promise of the day was prompt\r\nenough in coming. No sooner had he followed the timber-merchant in at\r\nthe door than he heard Grammer inform him that Mrs. Fitzpiers was still\r\nmore unwell than she had been in the morning. Old Dr. Jones being in\r\nthe neighborhood they had called him in, and he had instantly directed\r\nthem to get her to bed. They were not, however, to consider her illness\r\nserious\xe2\x80\x94a feverish, nervous attack the result of recent events, was\r\nwhat she was suffering from, and she would doubtless be well in a few\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nWinterborne, therefore, did not remain, and his hope of seeing her that\r\nevening was disappointed. Even this aggravation of her morning\r\ncondition did not greatly depress Melbury. He knew, he said, that his\r\ndaughter\xe2\x80\x99s constitution was sound enough. It was only these domestic\r\ntroubles that were pulling her down. Once free she would be blooming\r\nagain. Melbury diagnosed rightly, as parents usually do.\r\n\r\nHe set out for London the next morning, Jones having paid another visit\r\nand assured him that he might leave home without uneasiness, especially\r\non an errand of that sort, which would the sooner put an end to her\r\nsuspense.\r\n\r\nThe timber-merchant had been away only a day or two when it was told in\r\nHintock that Mr. Fitzpiers\xe2\x80\x99s hat had been found in the wood. Later on\r\nin the afternoon the hat was brought to Melbury, and, by a piece of\r\nill-fortune, into Grace\xe2\x80\x99s presence. It had doubtless lain in the wood\r\never since his fall from the horse, but it looked so clean and\r\nuninjured\xe2\x80\x94the summer weather and leafy shelter having much favored its\r\npreservation\xe2\x80\x94that Grace could not believe it had remained so long\r\nconcealed. A very little of fact was enough to set her fevered fancy at\r\nwork at this juncture; she thought him still in the neighborhood; she\r\nfeared his sudden appearance; and her nervous malady developed\r\nconsequences so grave that Dr. Jones began to look serious, and the\r\nhousehold was alarmed.\r\n\r\nIt was the beginning of June, and the cuckoo at this time of the summer\r\nscarcely ceased his cry for more than two or three hours during the\r\nnight. The bird\xe2\x80\x99s note, so familiar to her ears from infancy, was now\r\nabsolute torture to the poor girl. On the Friday following the\r\nWednesday of Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s departure, and the day after the discovery of\r\nFitzpiers\xe2\x80\x99s hat, the cuckoo began at two o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning with a\r\nsudden cry from one of Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s apple-trees, not three yards from the\r\nwindow of Grace\xe2\x80\x99s room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, he is coming!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, and in her terror sprang clean from the\r\nbed out upon the floor.\r\n\r\nThese starts and frights continued till noon; and when the doctor had\r\narrived and had seen her, and had talked with Mrs. Melbury, he sat down\r\nand meditated. That ever-present terror it was indispensable to remove\r\nfrom her mind at all hazards; and he thought how this might be done.\r\n\r\nWithout saying a word to anybody in the house, or to the disquieted\r\nWinterborne waiting in the lane below, Dr. Jones went home and wrote to\r\nMr. Melbury at the London address he had obtained from his wife. The\r\ngist of his communication was that Mrs. Fitzpiers should be assured as\r\nsoon as possible that steps were being taken to sever the bond which\r\nwas becoming a torture to her; that she would soon be free, and was\r\neven then virtually so. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you can say it _at once_ it may be the\r\nmeans of averting much harm,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWrite to herself; not to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn Saturday he drove over to Hintock, and assured her with mysterious\r\npacifications that in a day or two she might expect to receive some\r\nassuring news. So it turned out. When Sunday morning came there was a\r\nletter for Grace from her father. It arrived at seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock, the\r\nusual time at which the toddling postman passed by Hintock; at eight\r\nGrace awoke, having slept an hour or two for a wonder, and Mrs. Melbury\r\nbrought up the letter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you open it yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, yes!\xe2\x80\x9d said Grace, with feeble impatience. She tore the\r\nenvelope, unfolded the sheet, and read; when a creeping blush tinctured\r\nher white neck and cheek.\r\n\r\nHer father had exercised a bold discretion. He informed her that she\r\nneed have no further concern about Fitzpiers\xe2\x80\x99s return; that she would\r\nshortly be a free woman; and therefore, if she should desire to wed her\r\nold lover\xe2\x80\x94which he trusted was the case, since it was his own deep\r\nwish\xe2\x80\x94she would be in a position to do so. In this Melbury had not\r\nwritten beyond his belief. But he very much stretched the facts in\r\nadding that the legal formalities for dissolving her union were\r\npractically settled. The truth was that on the arrival of the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nletter poor Melbury had been much agitated, and could with difficulty\r\nbe prevented by Beaucock from returning to her bedside. What was the\r\nuse of his rushing back to Hintock? Beaucock had asked him. The only\r\nthing that could do her any good was a breaking of the bond. Though he\r\nhad not as yet had an interview with the eminent solicitor they were\r\nabout to consult, he was on the point of seeing him; and the case was\r\nclear enough. Thus the simple Melbury, urged by his parental alarm at\r\nher danger by the representations of his companion, and by the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nletter, had yielded, and sat down to tell her roundly that she was\r\nvirtually free.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you\xe2\x80\x99d better write also to the gentleman,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Beaucock,\r\nwho, scenting notoriety and the germ of a large practice in the case,\r\nwished to commit Melbury to it irretrievably; to effect which he knew\r\nthat nothing would be so potent as awakening the passion of Grace for\r\nWinterborne, so that her father might not have the heart to withdraw\r\nfrom his attempt to make her love legitimate when he discovered that\r\nthere were difficulties in the way.\r\n\r\nThe nervous, impatient Melbury was much pleased with the idea of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cstarting them at once,\xe2\x80\x9d as he called it. To put his long-delayed\r\nreparative scheme in train had become a passion with him now. He added\r\nto the letter addressed to his daughter a passage hinting that she\r\nought to begin to encourage Winterborne, lest she should lose him\r\naltogether; and he wrote to Giles that the path was virtually open for\r\nhim at last. Life was short, he declared; there were slips betwixt the\r\ncup and the lip; her interest in him should be reawakened at once, that\r\nall might be ready when the good time came for uniting them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt these warm words Winterborne was not less dazed than he was moved in\r\nheart. The novelty of the avowal rendered what it carried with it\r\ninapprehensible by him in its entirety.\r\n\r\nOnly a few short months ago completely estranged from this\r\nfamily\xe2\x80\x94beholding Grace going to and fro in the distance, clothed with\r\nthe alienating radiance of obvious superiority, the wife of the then\r\npopular and fashionable Fitzpiers, hopelessly outside his social\r\nboundary down to so recent a time that flowers then folded were hardly\r\nfaded yet\xe2\x80\x94he was now asked by that jealously guarding father of hers to\r\ntake courage\xe2\x80\x94to get himself ready for the day when he should be able to\r\nclaim her.\r\n\r\nThe old times came back to him in dim procession. How he had been\r\nsnubbed; how Melbury had despised his Christmas party; how that sweet,\r\ncoy Grace herself had looked down upon him and his household\r\narrangements, and poor Creedle\xe2\x80\x99s contrivances!\r\n\r\nWell, he could not believe it. Surely the adamantine barrier of\r\nmarriage with another could not be pierced like this! It did violence\r\nto custom. Yet a new law might do anything. But was it at all within\r\nthe bounds of probability that a woman who, over and above her own\r\nattainments, had been accustomed to those of a cultivated professional\r\nman, could ever be the wife of such as he?\r\n\r\nSince the date of his rejection he had almost grown to see the\r\nreasonableness of that treatment. He had said to himself again and\r\nagain that her father was right; that the poor ceorl, Giles\r\nWinterborne, would never have been able to make such a dainty girl\r\nhappy. Yet, now that she had stood in a position farther removed from\r\nhis own than at first, he was asked to prepare to woo her. He was full\r\nof doubt.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it was not in him to show backwardness. To act so\r\npromptly as Melbury desired him to act seemed, indeed, scarcely wise,\r\nbecause of the uncertainty of events. Giles knew nothing of legal\r\nprocedure, but he did know that for him to step up to Grace as a lover\r\nbefore the bond which bound her was actually dissolved was simply an\r\nextravagant dream of her father\xe2\x80\x99s overstrained mind. He pitied Melbury\r\nfor his almost childish enthusiasm, and saw that the aging man must\r\nhave suffered acutely to be weakened to this unreasoning desire.\r\n\r\nWinterborne was far too magnanimous to harbor any cynical conjecture\r\nthat the timber-merchant, in his intense affection for Grace, was\r\ncourting him now because that young lady, when disunited, would be left\r\nin an anomalous position, to escape which a bad husband was better than\r\nnone. He felt quite sure that his old friend was simply on tenterhooks\r\nof anxiety to repair the almost irreparable error of dividing two whom\r\nNature had striven to join together in earlier days, and that in his\r\nardor to do this he was oblivious of formalities. The cautious\r\nsupervision of his past years had overleaped itself at last. Hence,\r\nWinterborne perceived that, in this new beginning, the necessary care\r\nnot to compromise Grace by too early advances must be exercised by\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nPerhaps Winterborne was not quite so ardent as heretofore. There is no\r\nsuch thing as a stationary love: men are either loving more or loving\r\nless. But Giles himself recognized no decline in his sense of her\r\ndearness. If the flame did indeed burn lower now than when he had\r\nfetched her from Sherton at her last return from school, the marvel was\r\nsmall. He had been laboring ever since his rejection and her marriage\r\nto reduce his former passion to a docile friendship, out of pure regard\r\nto its expediency; and their separation may have helped him to a\r\npartial success.\r\n\r\nA week and more passed, and there was no further news of Melbury. But\r\nthe effect of the intelligence he had already transmitted upon the\r\nelastic-nerved daughter of the woods had been much what the old surgeon\r\nJones had surmised. It had soothed her perturbed spirit better than all\r\nthe opiates in the pharmacopoeia. She had slept unbrokenly a whole\r\nnight and a day. The \xe2\x80\x9cnew law\xe2\x80\x9d was to her a mysterious, beneficent,\r\ngodlike entity, lately descended upon earth, that would make her as she\r\nonce had been without trouble or annoyance. Her position fretted her,\r\nits abstract features rousing an aversion which was even greater than\r\nher aversion to the personality of him who had caused it. It was\r\nmortifying, productive of slights, undignified. Him she could forget;\r\nher circumstances she had always with her.\r\n\r\nShe saw nothing of Winterborne during the days of her recovery; and\r\nperhaps on that account her fancy wove about him a more romantic tissue\r\nthan it could have done if he had stood before her with all the specks\r\nand flaws inseparable from corporeity. He rose upon her memory as the\r\nfruit-god and the wood-god in alternation; sometimes leafy, and smeared\r\nwith green lichen, as she had seen him among the sappy boughs of the\r\nplantations; sometimes cider-stained, and with apple-pips in the hair\r\nof his arms, as she had met him on his return from cider-making in\r\nWhite Hart Vale, with his vats and presses beside him. In her secret\r\nheart she almost approximated to her father\xe2\x80\x99s enthusiasm in wishing to\r\nshow Giles once for all how she still regarded him. The question\r\nwhether the future would indeed bring them together for life was a\r\nstanding wonder with her. She knew that it could not with any propriety\r\ndo so just yet. But reverently believing in her father\xe2\x80\x99s sound judgment\r\nand knowledge, as good girls are wont to do, she remembered what he had\r\nwritten about her giving a hint to Winterborne lest there should be\r\nrisk in delay, and her feelings were not averse to such a step, so far\r\nas it could be done without danger at this early stage of the\r\nproceedings.\r\n\r\nFrom being a frail phantom of her former equable self she returned in\r\nbounds to a condition of passable philosophy. She bloomed again in the\r\nface in the course of a few days, and was well enough to go about as\r\nusual. One day Mrs. Melbury proposed that for a change she should be\r\ndriven in the gig to Sherton market, whither Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s man was going on\r\nother errands. Grace had no business whatever in Sherton; but it\r\ncrossed her mind that Winterborne would probably be there, and this\r\nmade the thought of such a drive interesting.\r\n\r\nOn the way she saw nothing of him; but when the horse was walking\r\nslowly through the obstructions of Sheep Street, she discerned the\r\nyoung man on the pavement. She thought of that time when he had been\r\nstanding under his apple-tree on her return from school, and of the\r\ntender opportunity then missed through her fastidiousness. Her heart\r\nrose in her throat. She abjured all such fastidiousness now. Nor did\r\nshe forget the last occasion on which she had beheld him in that town,\r\nmaking cider in the court-yard of the Earl of Wessex Hotel, while she\r\nwas figuring as a fine lady in the balcony above.\r\n\r\nGrace directed the man to set her down there in the midst, and\r\nimmediately went up to her lover. Giles had not before observed her,\r\nand his eyes now suppressedly looked his pleasure, without the\r\nembarrassment that had formerly marked him at such meetings.\r\n\r\nWhen a few words had been spoken, she said, archly, \xe2\x80\x9cI have nothing to\r\ndo. Perhaps you are deeply engaged?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI? Not a bit. My business now at the best of times is small, I am\r\nsorry to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, I am going into the Abbey. Come along with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe proposition had suggested itself as a quick escape from publicity,\r\nfor many eyes were regarding her. She had hoped that sufficient time\r\nhad elapsed for the extinction of curiosity; but it was quite\r\notherwise. The people looked at her with tender interest as the\r\ndeserted girl-wife\xe2\x80\x94without obtrusiveness, and without vulgarity; but\r\nshe was ill prepared for scrutiny in any shape.\r\n\r\nThey walked about the Abbey aisles, and presently sat down. Not a soul\r\nwas in the building save themselves. She regarded a stained window,\r\nwith her head sideways, and tentatively asked him if he remembered the\r\nlast time they were in that town alone.\r\n\r\nHe remembered it perfectly, and remarked, \xe2\x80\x9cYou were a proud miss then,\r\nand as dainty as you were high. Perhaps you are now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrace slowly shook her head. \xe2\x80\x9cAffliction has taken all that out of me,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe answered, impressively. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps I am too far the other way now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAs there was something lurking in this that she could not explain, she\r\nadded, so quickly as not to allow him time to think of it, \xe2\x80\x9cHas my\r\nfather written to you at all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Winterborne.\r\n\r\nShe glanced ponderingly up at him. \xe2\x80\x9cNot about me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis mouth was lined with charactery which told her that he had been\r\nbidden to take the hint as to the future which she had been bidden to\r\ngive. The unexpected discovery sent a scarlet pulsation through Grace\r\nfor the moment. However, it was only Giles who stood there, of whom she\r\nhad no fear; and her self-possession returned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe said I was to sound you with a view to\xe2\x80\x94what you will understand, if\r\nyou care to,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Winterborne, in a low voice. Having been put on\r\nthis track by herself, he was not disposed to abandon it in a hurry.\r\n\r\nThey had been children together, and there was between them that\r\nfamiliarity as to personal affairs which only such acquaintanceship can\r\ngive. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know, Giles,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, speaking in a very practical\r\ntone, \xe2\x80\x9cthat that is all very well; but I am in a very anomalous\r\nposition at present, and I cannot say anything to the point about such\r\nthings as those.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with a stray air as regarded the subject. He was looking\r\nat her with a curious consciousness of discovery. He had not been\r\nimagining that their renewed intercourse would show her to him thus.\r\nFor the first time he realized an unexpectedness in her, which, after\r\nall, should not have been unexpected. She before him was not the girl\r\nGrace Melbury whom he used to know. Of course, he might easily have\r\nprefigured as much; but it had never occurred to him. She was a woman\r\nwho had been married; she had moved on; and without having lost her\r\ngirlish modesty, she had lost her girlish shyness. The inevitable\r\nchange, though known to him, had not been heeded; and it struck him\r\ninto a momentary fixity. The truth was that he had never come into\r\nclose comradeship with her since her engagement to Fitzpiers, with the\r\nbrief exception of the evening encounter on Rubdown Hill, when she met\r\nhim with his cider apparatus; and that interview had been of too\r\ncursory a kind for insight.\r\n\r\nWinterborne had advanced, too. He could criticise her. Times had been\r\nwhen to criticise a single trait in Grace Melbury would have lain as\r\nfar beyond his powers as to criticise a deity. This thing was sure: it\r\nwas a new woman in many ways whom he had come out to see; a creature of\r\nmore ideas, more dignity, and, above all, more assurance, than the\r\noriginal Grace had been capable of. He could not at first decide\r\nwhether he were pleased or displeased at this. But upon the whole the\r\nnovelty attracted him.\r\n\r\nShe was so sweet and sensitive that she feared his silence betokened\r\nsomething in his brain of the nature of an enemy to her. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you\r\nthinking of that makes those lines come in your forehead?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not mean to offend you by speaking of the time being premature\r\nas yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTouched by the genuine loving-kindness which had lain at the foundation\r\nof these words, and much moved, Winterborne turned his face aside, as\r\nhe took her by the hand. He was grieved that he had criticised her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are very good, dear Grace,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in a low voice. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are\r\nbetter, much better, than you used to be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe could not very well tell her how, and said, with an evasive smile,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are prettier;\xe2\x80\x9d which was not what he really had meant. He then\r\nremained still holding her right hand in his own right, so that they\r\nfaced in opposite ways; and as he did not let go, she ventured upon a\r\ntender remonstrance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think we have gone as far as we ought to go at present\xe2\x80\x94and far\r\nenough to satisfy my poor father that we are the same as ever. You see,\r\nGiles, my case is not settled yet, and if\xe2\x80\x94Oh, suppose I _never_ get\r\nfree!\xe2\x80\x94there should be any hitch or informality!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe drew a catching breath, and turned pale. The dialogue had been\r\naffectionate comedy up to this point. The gloomy atmosphere of the\r\npast, and the still gloomy horizon of the present, had been for the\r\ninterval forgotten. Now the whole environment came back, the due\r\nbalance of shade among the light was restored.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is sure to be all right, I trust?\xe2\x80\x9d she resumed, in uneasy accents.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did my father say the solicitor had told him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x94that all is sure enough. The case is so clear\xe2\x80\x94nothing could be\r\nclearer. But the legal part is not yet quite done and finished, as is\r\nnatural.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no\xe2\x80\x94of course not,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, sunk in meek thought. \xe2\x80\x9cBut father said\r\nit was _almost_\xe2\x80\x94did he not? Do you know anything about the new law that\r\nmakes these things so easy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing\xe2\x80\x94except the general fact that it enables ill-assorted husbands\r\nand wives to part in a way they could not formerly do without an Act of\r\nParliament.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you to sign a paper, or swear anything? Is it something like\r\nthat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I believe so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long has it been introduced?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout six months or a year, the lawyer said, I think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo hear these two poor Arcadian innocents talk of imperial law would\r\nhave made a humane person weep who should have known what a dangerous\r\nstructure they were building up on their supposed knowledge. They\r\nremained in thought, like children in the presence of the\r\nincomprehensible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGiles,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, at last, \xe2\x80\x9cit makes me quite weary when I think how\r\nserious my situation is, or has been. Shall we not go out from here\r\nnow, as it may seem rather fast of me\xe2\x80\x94our being so long together, I\r\nmean\xe2\x80\x94if anybody were to see us? I am almost sure,\xe2\x80\x9d she added,\r\nuncertainly, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I ought not to let you hold my hand yet, knowing\r\nthat the documents\xe2\x80\x94or whatever it may be\xe2\x80\x94have not been signed; so that\r\nI\xe2\x80\x94am still as married as ever\xe2\x80\x94or almost. My dear father has forgotten\r\nhimself. Not that I feel morally bound to any one else, after what has\r\ntaken place\xe2\x80\x94no woman of spirit could\xe2\x80\x94now, too, that several months have\r\npassed. But I wish to keep the proprieties as well as I can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes. Still, your father reminds us that life is short. I myself\r\nfeel that it is; that is why I wished to understand you in this that we\r\nhave begun. At times, dear Grace, since receiving your father\xe2\x80\x99s letter,\r\nI am as uneasy and fearful as a child at what he said. If one of us\r\nwere to die before the formal signing and sealing that is to release\r\nyou have been done\xe2\x80\x94if we should drop out of the world and never have\r\nmade the most of this little, short, but real opportunity, I should\r\nthink to myself as I sunk down dying, \xe2\x80\x98Would to my God that I had\r\nspoken out my whole heart\xe2\x80\x94given her one poor little kiss when I had the\r\nchance to give it! But I never did, although she had promised to be\r\nmine some day; and now I never can.\xe2\x80\x99 That\xe2\x80\x99s what I should think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had begun by watching the words from his lips with a mournful\r\nregard, as though their passage were visible; but as he went on she\r\ndropped her glance. \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI have thought that, too. And,\r\nbecause I have thought it, I by no means meant, in speaking of the\r\nproprieties, to be reserved and cold to you who loved me so long ago,\r\nor to hurt your heart as I used to do at that thoughtless time. Oh, not\r\nat all, indeed! But\xe2\x80\x94ought I to allow you?\xe2\x80\x94oh, it is too quick\xe2\x80\x94surely!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHer eyes filled with tears of bewildered, alarmed emotion.\r\n\r\nWinterborne was too straightforward to influence her further against\r\nher better judgment. \xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94I suppose it is,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, repentantly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nwait till all is settled. What did your father say in that last\r\nletter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe meant about his progress with the petition; but she, mistaking him,\r\nfrankly spoke of the personal part. \xe2\x80\x9cHe said\xe2\x80\x94what I have implied.\r\nShould I tell more plainly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t, if it is a secret.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all. I will tell every word, straight out, Giles, if you wish.\r\nHe said I was to encourage you. There. But I cannot obey him further\r\nto-day. Come, let us go now.\xe2\x80\x9d She gently slid her hand from his, and\r\nwent in front of him out of the Abbey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was thinking of getting some dinner,\xe2\x80\x9d said Winterborne, changing to\r\nthe prosaic, as they walked. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you, too, must require something. Do\r\nlet me take you to a place I know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrace was almost without a friend in the world outside her father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse; her life with Fitzpiers had brought her no society; had\r\nsometimes, indeed, brought her deeper solitude and inconsideration than\r\nany she had ever known before. Hence it was a treat to her to find\r\nherself again the object of thoughtful care. But she questioned if to\r\ngo publicly to dine with Giles Winterborne were not a proposal, due\r\nrather to his unsophistication than to his discretion. She said gently\r\nthat she would much prefer his ordering her lunch at some place and\r\nthen coming to tell her it was ready, while she remained in the Abbey\r\nporch. Giles saw her secret reasoning, thought how hopelessly blind to\r\npropriety he was beside her, and went to do as she wished.\r\n\r\nHe was not absent more than ten minutes, and found Grace where he had\r\nleft her. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will be quite ready by the time you get there,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\nand told her the name of the inn at which the meal had been ordered,\r\nwhich was one that she had never heard of.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll find it by inquiry,\xe2\x80\x9d said Grace, setting out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd shall I see you again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes\xe2\x80\x94come to me there. It will not be like going together. I shall\r\nwant you to find my father\xe2\x80\x99s man and the gig for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe waited on some ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, till he thought\r\nher lunch ended, and that he might fairly take advantage of her\r\ninvitation to start her on her way home. He went straight to The Three\r\nTuns\xe2\x80\x94a little tavern in a side street, scrupulously clean, but humble\r\nand inexpensive. On his way he had an occasional misgiving as to\r\nwhether the place had been elegant enough for her; and as soon as he\r\nentered it, and saw her ensconced there, he perceived that he had\r\nblundered.\r\n\r\nGrace was seated in the only dining-room that the simple old hostelry\r\ncould boast of, which was also a general parlor on market-days; a long,\r\nlow apartment, with a sanded floor herring-boned with a broom; a wide,\r\nred-curtained window to the street, and another to the garden. Grace\r\nhad retreated to the end of the room looking out upon the latter, the\r\nfront part being full of a mixed company which had dropped in since he\r\nwas there.\r\n\r\nShe was in a mood of the greatest depression. On arriving, and seeing\r\nwhat the tavern was like, she had been taken by surprise; but having\r\ngone too far to retreat, she had heroically entered and sat down on the\r\nwell-scrubbed settle, opposite the narrow table with its knives and\r\nsteel forks, tin pepper-boxes, blue salt-cellars, and posters\r\nadvertising the sale of bullocks against the wall. The last time that\r\nshe had taken any meal in a public place it had been with Fitzpiers at\r\nthe grand new Earl of Wessex Hotel in that town, after a two months\xe2\x80\x99\r\nroaming and sojourning at the gigantic hotels of the Continent. How\r\ncould she have expected any other kind of accommodation in present\r\ncircumstances than such as Giles had provided? And yet how unprepared\r\nshe was for this change! The tastes that she had acquired from\r\nFitzpiers had been imbibed so subtly that she hardly knew she possessed\r\nthem till confronted by this contrast. The elegant Fitzpiers, in fact,\r\nat that very moment owed a long bill at the above-mentioned hotel for\r\nthe luxurious style in which he used to put her up there whenever they\r\ndrove to Sherton. But such is social sentiment, that she had been quite\r\ncomfortable under those debt-impending conditions, while she felt\r\nhumiliated by her present situation, which Winterborne had paid for\r\nhonestly on the nail.\r\n\r\nHe had noticed in a moment that she shrunk from her position, and all\r\nhis pleasure was gone. It was the same susceptibility over again which\r\nhad spoiled his Christmas party long ago.\r\n\r\nBut he did not know that this recrudescence was only the casual result\r\nof Grace\xe2\x80\x99s apprenticeship to what she was determined to learn in spite\r\nof it\xe2\x80\x94a consequence of one of those sudden surprises which confront\r\neverybody bent upon turning over a new leaf. She had finished her\r\nlunch, which he saw had been a very mincing performance; and he brought\r\nher out of the house as soon as he could.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with great sad eyes, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have not finished at all\r\nwell, I know. Come round to the Earl of Wessex. I\xe2\x80\x99ll order a tea there.\r\nI did not remember that what was good enough for me was not good enough\r\nfor you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer face faded into an aspect of deep distress when she saw what had\r\nhappened. \xe2\x80\x9cOh no, Giles,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with extreme pathos; \xe2\x80\x9ccertainly\r\nnot. Why do you\xe2\x80\x94say that when you know better? You _ever_ will\r\nmisunderstand me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, that\xe2\x80\x99s not so, Mrs. Fitzpiers. Can you deny that you felt out\r\nof place at The Three Tuns?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Well, since you make me speak, I do not deny it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet I have felt at home there these twenty years. Your husband\r\nused always to take you to the Earl of Wessex, did he not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she reluctantly admitted. How could she explain in the street of\r\na market-town that it was her superficial and transitory taste which\r\nhad been offended, and not her nature or her affection? Fortunately, or\r\nunfortunately, at that moment they saw Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s man driving vacantly\r\nalong the street in search of her, the hour having passed at which he\r\nhad been told to take her up. Winterborne hailed him, and she was\r\npowerless then to prolong the discourse. She entered the vehicle sadly,\r\nand the horse trotted away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll night did Winterborne think over that unsatisfactory ending of a\r\npleasant time, forgetting the pleasant time itself. He feared anew that\r\nthey could never be happy together, even should she be free to choose\r\nhim. She was accomplished; he was unrefined. It was the original\r\ndifficulty, which he was too sensitive to recklessly ignore, as some\r\nmen would have done in his place.\r\n\r\nHe was one of those silent, unobtrusive beings who want little from\r\nothers in the way of favor or condescension, and perhaps on that very\r\naccount scrutinize those others\xe2\x80\x99 behavior too closely. He was not\r\nversatile, but one in whom a hope or belief which had once had its\r\nrise, meridian, and decline seldom again exactly recurred, as in the\r\nbreasts of more sanguine mortals. He had once worshipped her, laid out\r\nhis life to suit her, wooed her, and lost her. Though it was with\r\nalmost the same zest, it was with not quite the same hope, that he had\r\nbegun to tread the old tracks again, and allowed himself to be so\r\ncharmed with her that day.\r\n\r\nMove another step towards her he would not. He would even repulse\r\nher\xe2\x80\x94as a tribute to conscience. It would be sheer sin to let her\r\nprepare a pitfall for her happiness not much smaller than the first by\r\ninveigling her into a union with such as he. Her poor father was now\r\nblind to these subtleties, which he had formerly beheld as in noontide\r\nlight. It was his own duty to declare them\xe2\x80\x94for her dear sake.\r\n\r\nGrace, too, had a very uncomfortable night, and her solicitous\r\nembarrassment was not lessened the next morning when another letter\r\nfrom her father was put into her hands. Its tenor was an intenser\r\nstrain of the one that had preceded it. After stating how extremely\r\nglad he was to hear that she was better, and able to get out-of-doors,\r\nhe went on:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a wearisome business, the solicitor we have come to see being\r\nout of town. I do not know when I shall get home. My great anxiety in\r\nthis delay is still lest you should lose Giles Winterborne. I cannot\r\nrest at night for thinking that while our business is hanging fire he\r\nmay become estranged, or go away from the neighborhood. I have set my\r\nheart upon seeing him your husband, if you ever have another. Do, then,\r\nGrace, give him some temporary encouragement, even though it is\r\nover-early. For when I consider the past I do think God will forgive me\r\nand you for being a little forward. I have another reason for this, my\r\ndear. I feel myself going rapidly downhill, and late affairs have still\r\nfurther helped me that way. And until this thing is done I cannot rest\r\nin peace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nHe added a postscript:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have just heard that the solicitor is to be seen to-morrow.\r\nPossibly, therefore, I shall return in the evening after you get this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe paternal longing ran on all fours with her own desire; and yet in\r\nforwarding it yesterday she had been on the brink of giving offence.\r\nWhile craving to be a country girl again just as her father requested;\r\nto put off the old Eve, the fastidious miss\xe2\x80\x94or rather madam\xe2\x80\x94completely,\r\nher first attempt had been beaten by the unexpected vitality of that\r\nfastidiousness. Her father on returning and seeing the trifling\r\ncoolness of Giles would be sure to say that the same perversity which\r\nhad led her to make difficulties about marrying Fitzpiers was now\r\nprompting her to blow hot and cold with poor Winterborne.\r\n\r\nIf the latter had been the most subtle hand at touching the stops of\r\nher delicate soul instead of one who had just bound himself to let her\r\ndrift away from him again (if she would) on the wind of her estranging\r\neducation, he could not have acted more seductively than he did that\r\nday. He chanced to be superintending some temporary work in a field\r\nopposite her windows. She could not discover what he was doing, but she\r\nread his mood keenly and truly: she could see in his coming and going\r\nan air of determined abandonment of the whole landscape that lay in her\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nOh, how she longed to make it up with him! Her father coming in the\r\nevening\xe2\x80\x94which meant, she supposed, that all formalities would be in\r\ntrain, her marriage virtually annulled, and she be free to be won\r\nagain\xe2\x80\x94how could she look him in the face if he should see them\r\nestranged thus?\r\n\r\nIt was a fair green evening in June. She was seated in the garden, in\r\nthe rustic chair which stood under the laurel-bushes\xe2\x80\x94made of peeled\r\noak-branches that came to Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s premises as refuse after\r\nbarking-time. The mass of full-juiced leafage on the heights around her\r\nwas just swayed into faint gestures by a nearly spent wind which, even\r\nin its enfeebled state, did not reach her shelter. All day she had\r\nexpected Giles to call\xe2\x80\x94to inquire how she had got home, or something or\r\nother; but he had not come. And he still tantalized her by going\r\nathwart and across that orchard opposite. She could see him as she sat.\r\n\r\nA slight diversion was presently created by Creedle bringing him a\r\nletter. She knew from this that Creedle had just come from Sherton, and\r\nhad called as usual at the post-office for anything that had arrived by\r\nthe afternoon post, of which there was no delivery at Hintock. She\r\npondered on what the letter might contain\xe2\x80\x94particularly whether it were\r\na second refresher for Winterborne from her father, like her own of the\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nBut it appeared to have no bearing upon herself whatever. Giles read\r\nits contents; and almost immediately turned away to a gap in the hedge\r\nof the orchard\xe2\x80\x94if that could be called a hedge which, owing to the\r\ndrippings of the trees, was little more than a bank with a bush upon it\r\nhere and there. He entered the plantation, and was no doubt going that\r\nway homeward to the mysterious hut he occupied on the other side of the\r\nwoodland.\r\n\r\nThe sad sands were running swiftly through Time\xe2\x80\x99s glass; she had often\r\nfelt it in these latter days; and, like Giles, she felt it doubly now\r\nafter the solemn and pathetic reminder in her father\xe2\x80\x99s communication.\r\nHer freshness would pass, the long-suffering devotion of Giles might\r\nsuddenly end\xe2\x80\x94might end that very hour. Men were so strange. The thought\r\ntook away from her all her former reticence, and made her action bold.\r\nShe started from her seat. If the little breach, quarrel, or whatever\r\nit might be called, of yesterday, was to be healed up it must be done\r\nby her on the instant. She crossed into the orchard, and clambered\r\nthrough the gap after Giles, just as he was diminishing to a faun-like\r\nfigure under the green canopy and over the brown floor.\r\n\r\nGrace had been wrong\xe2\x80\x94very far wrong\xe2\x80\x94in assuming that the letter had no\r\nreference to herself because Giles had turned away into the wood after\r\nits perusal. It was, sad to say, because the missive had so much\r\nreference to herself that he had thus turned away. He feared that his\r\ngrieved discomfiture might be observed. The letter was from Beaucock,\r\nwritten a few hours later than Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s to his daughter. It announced\r\nfailure.\r\n\r\nGiles had once done that thriftless man a good turn, and now was the\r\nmoment when Beaucock had chosen to remember it in his own way. During\r\nhis absence in town with Melbury, the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s clerk had naturally\r\nheard a great deal of the timber-merchant\xe2\x80\x99s family scheme of justice to\r\nGiles, and his communication was to inform Winterborne at the earliest\r\npossible moment that their attempt had failed, in order that the young\r\nman should not place himself in a false position towards Grace in the\r\nbelief of its coming success. The news was, in sum, that Fitzpiers\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconduct had not been sufficiently cruel to Grace to enable her to snap\r\nthe bond. She was apparently doomed to be his wife till the end of the\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\nWinterborne quite forgot his superficial differences with the poor girl\r\nunder the warm rush of deep and distracting love for her which the\r\nalmost tragical information engendered.\r\n\r\nTo renounce her forever\xe2\x80\x94that was then the end of it for him, after all.\r\nThere was no longer any question about suitability, or room for tiffs\r\non petty tastes. The curtain had fallen again between them. She could\r\nnot be his. The cruelty of their late revived hope was now terrible.\r\nHow could they all have been so simple as to suppose this thing could\r\nbe done?\r\n\r\nIt was at this moment that, hearing some one coming behind him, he\r\nturned and saw her hastening on between the thickets. He perceived in\r\nan instant that she did not know the blighting news.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGiles, why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you come across to me?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, with arch\r\nreproach. \xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t you see me sitting there ever so long?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in unprepared, extemporized tones, for her\r\nunexpected presence caught him without the slightest plan of behavior\r\nin the conjuncture. His manner made her think that she had been too\r\nchiding in her speech; and a mild scarlet wave passed over her as she\r\nresolved to soften it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have had another letter from my father,\xe2\x80\x9d she hastened to continue.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe thinks he may come home this evening. And\xe2\x80\x94in view of his hopes\xe2\x80\x94it\r\nwill grieve him if there is any little difference between us, Giles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is none,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, sadly regarding her from the face downward as\r\nhe pondered how to lay the cruel truth bare.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill\xe2\x80\x94I fear you have not quite forgiven me about my being\r\nuncomfortable at the inn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have, Grace, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you speak in quite an unhappy way,\xe2\x80\x9d she returned, coming up close\r\nto him with the most winning of the many pretty airs that appertained\r\nto her. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you think you will ever be happy, Giles?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe did not reply for some instants. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen the sun shines on the north\r\nfront of Sherton Abbey\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s when my happiness will come to me!\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nhe, staring as it were into the earth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\x94then that means that there is something more than my offending you\r\nin not liking The Three Tuns. If it is because I\xe2\x80\x94did not like to let\r\nyou kiss me in the Abbey\xe2\x80\x94well, you know, Giles, that it was not on\r\naccount of my cold feelings, but because I did certainly, just then,\r\nthink it was rather premature, in spite of my poor father. That was the\r\ntrue reason\xe2\x80\x94the sole one. But I do not want to be hard\xe2\x80\x94God knows I do\r\nnot,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, her voice fluctuating. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd perhaps\xe2\x80\x94as I am on the\r\nverge of freedom\xe2\x80\x94I am not right, after all, in thinking there is any\r\nharm in your kissing me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh God!\xe2\x80\x9d said Winterborne within himself. His head was turned askance\r\nas he still resolutely regarded the ground. For the last several\r\nminutes he had seen this great temptation approaching him in regular\r\nsiege; and now it had come. The wrong, the social sin, of now taking\r\nadvantage of the offer of her lips had a magnitude, in the eyes of one\r\nwhose life had been so primitive, so ruled by purest household laws, as\r\nGiles\xe2\x80\x99s, which can hardly be explained.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you say anything?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, timidly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no\xe2\x80\x94only that\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean that it must _be already_ settled, since my father is coming\r\nhome?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, gladly.\r\n\r\nWinterborne, though fighting valiantly against himself all this\r\nwhile\xe2\x80\x94though he would have protected Grace\xe2\x80\x99s good repute as the apple\r\nof his eye\xe2\x80\x94was a man; and, as Desdemona said, men are not gods. In face\r\nof the agonizing seductiveness shown by her, in her unenlightened\r\nschool-girl simplicity about the laws and ordinances, he betrayed a\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s weakness. Since it was so\xe2\x80\x94since it had come to this, that Grace,\r\ndeeming herself free to do it, was virtually asking him to demonstrate\r\nthat he loved her\xe2\x80\x94since he could demonstrate it only too truly\xe2\x80\x94since\r\nlife was short and love was strong\xe2\x80\x94he gave way to the temptation,\r\nnotwithstanding that he perfectly well knew her to be wedded\r\nirrevocably to Fitzpiers. Indeed, he cared for nothing past or future,\r\nsimply accepting the present and what it brought, desiring once in his\r\nlife to clasp in his arms her he had watched over and loved so long.\r\n\r\nShe started back suddenly from his embrace, influenced by a sort of\r\ninspiration. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d she stammered, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I am really\r\nfree?\xe2\x80\x94that this is right? Is there _really_ a new law? Father cannot\r\nhave been too sanguine in saying\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe did not answer, and a moment afterwards Grace burst into tears in\r\nspite of herself. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, why does not my father come home and explain,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe sobbed, \xe2\x80\x9cand let me know clearly what I am? It is too trying, this,\r\nto ask me to\xe2\x80\x94and then to leave me so long in so vague a state that I do\r\nnot know what to do, and perhaps do wrong!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWinterborne felt like a very Cain, over and above his previous sorrow.\r\nHow he had sinned against her in not telling her what he knew. He\r\nturned aside; the feeling of his cruelty mounted higher and higher. How\r\ncould he have dreamed of kissing her? He could hardly refrain from\r\ntears. Surely nothing more pitiable had ever been known than the\r\ncondition of this poor young thing, now as heretofore the victim of her\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s well-meant but blundering policy.\r\n\r\nEven in the hour of Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s greatest assurance Winterborne had\r\nharbored a suspicion that no law, new or old, could undo Grace\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmarriage without her appearance in public; though he was not\r\nsufficiently sure of what might have been enacted to destroy by his own\r\nwords her pleasing idea that a mere dash of the pen, on her father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntestimony, was going to be sufficient. But he had never suspected the\r\nsad fact that the position was irremediable.\r\n\r\nPoor Grace, perhaps feeling that she had indulged in too much fluster\r\nfor a mere kiss, calmed herself at finding how grave he was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad we are friends again anyhow,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, smiling through her\r\ntears. \xe2\x80\x9cGiles, if you had only shown half the boldness before I married\r\nthat you show now, you would have carried me off for your own first\r\ninstead of second. If we do marry, I hope you will never think badly of\r\nme for encouraging you a little, but my father is _so_ impatient, you\r\nknow, as his years and infirmities increase, that he will wish to see\r\nus a little advanced when he comes. That is my only excuse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo Winterborne all this was sadder than it was sweet. How could she so\r\ntrust her father\xe2\x80\x99s conjectures? He did not know how to tell her the\r\ntruth and shame himself. And yet he felt that it must be done. \xe2\x80\x9cWe may\r\nhave been wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d he began, almost fearfully, \xe2\x80\x9cin supposing that it can\r\nall be carried out while we stay here at Hintock. I am not sure but\r\nthat people may have to appear in a public court even under the new\r\nAct; and if there should be any difficulty, and we cannot marry after\r\nall\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer cheeks became slowly bloodless. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Giles,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, grasping his\r\narm, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have heard something! What\xe2\x80\x94cannot my father conclude it there\r\nand now? Surely he has done it? Oh, Giles, Giles, don\xe2\x80\x99t deceive me.\r\nWhat terrible position am I in?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe could not tell her, try as he would. The sense of her implicit trust\r\nin his honor absolutely disabled him. \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot inform you,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nmurmured, his voice as husky as that of the leaves underfoot. \xe2\x80\x9cYour\r\nfather will soon be here. Then we shall know. I will take you home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nInexpressibly dear as she was to him, he offered her his arm with the\r\nmost reserved air, as he added, correctingly, \xe2\x80\x9cI will take you, at any\r\nrate, into the drive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus they walked on together. Grace vibrating between happiness and\r\nmisgiving. It was only a few minutes\xe2\x80\x99 walk to where the drive ran, and\r\nthey had hardly descended into it when they heard a voice behind them\r\ncry, \xe2\x80\x9cTake out that arm!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a moment they did not heed, and the voice repeated, more loudly and\r\nhoarsely,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake out that arm!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s. He had returned sooner than they expected, and now\r\ncame up to them. Grace\xe2\x80\x99s hand had been withdrawn like lightning on her\r\nhearing the second command. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t blame you\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t blame you,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, in the weary cadence of one broken down with scourgings. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you\r\ntwo must walk together no more\xe2\x80\x94I have been surprised\xe2\x80\x94I have been\r\ncruelly deceived\xe2\x80\x94Giles, don\xe2\x80\x99t say anything to me; but go away!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was evidently not aware that Winterborne had known the truth before\r\nhe brought it; and Giles would not stay to discuss it with him then.\r\nWhen the young man had gone Melbury took his daughter in-doors to the\r\nroom he used as his office. There he sat down, and bent over the slope\r\nof the bureau, her bewildered gaze fixed upon him.\r\n\r\nWhen Melbury had recovered a little he said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou are now, as ever,\r\nFitzpiers\xe2\x80\x99s wife. I was deluded. He has not done you _enough_ harm. You\r\nare still subject to his beck and call.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen let it be, and never mind, father,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with dignified\r\nsorrow. \xe2\x80\x9cI can bear it. It is your trouble that grieves me most.\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\nstooped over him, and put her arm round his neck, which distressed\r\nMelbury still more. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mind at all what comes to me,\xe2\x80\x9d Grace\r\ncontinued; \xe2\x80\x9cwhose wife I am, or whose I am not. I do love Giles; I\r\ncannot help that; and I have gone further with him than I should have\r\ndone if I had known exactly how things were. But I do not reproach\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen Giles did not tell you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Melbury.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cHe could not have known it. His behavior to me proved\r\nthat he did not know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer father said nothing more, and Grace went away to the solitude of\r\nher chamber.\r\n\r\nHer heavy disquietude had many shapes; and for a time she put aside the\r\ndominant fact to think of her too free conduct towards Giles. His\r\nlove-making had been brief as it was sweet; but would he on reflection\r\ncontemn her for forwardness? How could she have been so simple as to\r\nsuppose she was in a position to behave as she had done! Thus she\r\nmentally blamed her ignorance; and yet in the centre of her heart she\r\nblessed it a little for what it had momentarily brought her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL.\r\n\r\n\r\nLife among the people involved in these events seemed to be suppressed\r\nand hide-bound for a while. Grace seldom showed herself outside the\r\nhouse, never outside the garden; for she feared she might encounter\r\nGiles Winterborne; and that she could not bear.\r\n\r\nThis pensive intramural existence of the self-constituted nun appeared\r\nlikely to continue for an indefinite time. She had learned that there\r\nwas one possibility in which her formerly imagined position might\r\nbecome real, and only one; that her husband\xe2\x80\x99s absence should continue\r\nlong enough to amount to positive desertion. But she never allowed her\r\nmind to dwell much upon the thought; still less did she deliberately\r\nhope for such a result. Her regard for Winterborne had been rarefied by\r\nthe shock which followed its avowal into an ethereal emotion that had\r\nlittle to do with living and doing.\r\n\r\nAs for Giles, he was lying\xe2\x80\x94or rather sitting\xe2\x80\x94ill at his hut. A feverish\r\nindisposition which had been hanging about him for some time, the\r\nresult of a chill caught the previous winter, seemed to acquire\r\nvirulence with the prostration of his hopes. But not a soul knew of his\r\nlanguor, and he did not think the case serious enough to send for a\r\nmedical man. After a few days he was better again, and crept about his\r\nhome in a great coat, attending to his simple wants as usual with his\r\nown hands. So matters stood when the limpid inertion of Grace\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npool-like existence was disturbed as by a geyser. She received a letter\r\nfrom Fitzpiers.\r\n\r\nSuch a terrible letter it was in its import, though couched in the\r\ngentlest language. In his absence Grace had grown to regard him with\r\ntoleration, and her relation to him with equanimity, till she had\r\nalmost forgotten how trying his presence would be. He wrote briefly and\r\nunaffectedly; he made no excuses, but informed her that he was living\r\nquite alone, and had been led to think that they ought to be together,\r\nif she would make up her mind to forgive him. He therefore purported to\r\ncross the Channel to Budmouth by the steamer on a day he named, which\r\nshe found to be three days after the time of her present reading.\r\n\r\nHe said that he could not come to Hintock for obvious reasons, which\r\nher father would understand even better than herself. As the only\r\nalternative she was to be on the quay to meet the steamer when it\r\narrived from the opposite coast, probably about half an hour before\r\nmidnight, bringing with her any luggage she might require; join him\r\nthere, and pass with him into the twin vessel, which left immediately\r\nthe other entered the harbor; returning thus with him to his\r\ncontinental dwelling-place, which he did not name. He had no intention\r\nof showing himself on land at all.\r\n\r\nThe troubled Grace took the letter to her father, who now continued for\r\nlong hours by the fireless summer chimney-corner, as if he thought it\r\nwere winter, the pitcher of cider standing beside him, mostly untasted,\r\nand coated with a film of dust. After reading it he looked up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t go,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had felt I would not,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I did not know what you\r\nwould say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf he comes and lives in England, not too near here and in a\r\nrespectable way, and wants you to come to him, I am not sure that I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\noppose him in wishing it,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Melbury. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d stint myself to keep\r\nyou both in a genteel and seemly style. But go abroad you never shall\r\nwith my consent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere the question rested that day. Grace was unable to reply to her\r\nhusband in the absence of an address, and the morrow came, and the next\r\nday, and the evening on which he had requested her to meet him.\r\nThroughout the whole of it she remained within the four walls of her\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nThe sense of her harassment, carking doubt of what might be impending,\r\nhung like a cowl of blackness over the Melbury household. They spoke\r\nalmost in whispers, and wondered what Fitzpiers would do next. It was\r\nthe hope of every one that, finding she did not arrive, he would return\r\nagain to France; and as for Grace, she was willing to write to him on\r\nthe most kindly terms if he would only keep away.\r\n\r\nThe night passed, Grace lying tense and wide awake, and her relatives,\r\nin great part, likewise. When they met the next morning they were pale\r\nand anxious, though neither speaking of the subject which occupied all\r\ntheir thoughts. The day passed as quietly as the previous ones, and she\r\nbegan to think that in the rank caprice of his moods he had abandoned\r\nthe idea of getting her to join him as quickly as it was formed. All on\r\na sudden, some person who had just come from Sherton entered the house\r\nwith the news that Mr. Fitzpiers was on his way home to Hintock. He had\r\nbeen seen hiring a carriage at the Earl of Wessex Hotel.\r\n\r\nHer father and Grace were both present when the intelligence was\r\nannounced.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Melbury, \xe2\x80\x9cwe must make the best of what has been a very bad\r\nmatter. The man is repenting; the partner of his shame, I hear, is gone\r\naway from him to Switzerland, so that chapter of his life is probably\r\nover. If he chooses to make a home for ye I think you should not say\r\nhim nay, Grace. Certainly he cannot very well live at Hintock without a\r\nblow to his pride; but if he can bear that, and likes Hintock best,\r\nwhy, there\xe2\x80\x99s the empty wing of the house as it was before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, father!\xe2\x80\x9d said Grace, turning white with dismay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, a little of his former doggedness returning. He\r\nwas, in truth, disposed to somewhat more leniency towards her husband\r\njust now than he had shown formerly, from a conviction that he had\r\ntreated him over-roughly in his anger. \xe2\x80\x9cSurely it is the most\r\nrespectable thing to do?\xe2\x80\x9d he continued. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like this state that\r\nyou are in\xe2\x80\x94neither married nor single. It hurts me, and it hurts you,\r\nand it will always be remembered against us in Hintock. There has never\r\nbeen any scandal like it in the family before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe will be here in less than an hour,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Grace. The twilight of\r\nthe room prevented her father seeing the despondent misery of her face.\r\nThe one intolerable condition, the condition she had deprecated above\r\nall others, was that of Fitzpiers\xe2\x80\x99s reinstatement there. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I won\xe2\x80\x99t,\r\nI won\xe2\x80\x99t see him,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, sinking down. She was almost hysterical.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTry if you cannot,\xe2\x80\x9d he returned, moodily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, I will, I will,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, inconsequently. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll try;\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\njumping up suddenly, she left the room.\r\n\r\nIn the darkness of the apartment to which she flew nothing could have\r\nbeen seen during the next half-hour; but from a corner a quick\r\nbreathing was audible from this impressible creature, who combined\r\nmodern nerves with primitive emotions, and was doomed by such\r\ncoexistence to be numbered among the distressed, and to take her\r\nscourgings to their exquisite extremity.\r\n\r\nThe window was open. On this quiet, late summer evening, whatever sound\r\narose in so secluded a district\xe2\x80\x94the chirp of a bird, a call from a\r\nvoice, the turning of a wheel\xe2\x80\x94extended over bush and tree to unwonted\r\ndistances. Very few sounds did arise. But as Grace invisibly breathed\r\nin the brown glooms of the chamber, the small remote noise of light\r\nwheels came in to her, accompanied by the trot of a horse on the\r\nturnpike-road. There seemed to be a sudden hitch or pause in the\r\nprogress of the vehicle, which was what first drew her attention to it.\r\nShe knew the point whence the sound proceeded\xe2\x80\x94the hill-top over which\r\ntravellers passed on their way hitherward from Sherton Abbas\xe2\x80\x94the place\r\nat which she had emerged from the wood with Mrs. Charmond. Grace slid\r\nalong the floor, and bent her head over the window-sill, listening with\r\nopen lips. The carriage had stopped, and she heard a man use\r\nexclamatory words. Then another said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat the devil is the matter\r\nwith the horse?\xe2\x80\x9d She recognized the voice as her husband\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nThe accident, such as it had been, was soon remedied, and the carriage\r\ncould be heard descending the hill on the Hintock side, soon to turn\r\ninto the lane leading out of the highway, and then into the \xe2\x80\x9cdrong\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwhich led out of the lane to the house where she was.\r\n\r\nA spasm passed through Grace. The Daphnean instinct, exceptionally\r\nstrong in her as a girl, had been revived by her widowed seclusion; and\r\nit was not lessened by her affronted sentiments towards the comer, and\r\nher regard for another man. She opened some little ivory tablets that\r\nlay on the dressing-table, scribbled in pencil on one of them, \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\ngone to visit one of my school-friends,\xe2\x80\x9d gathered a few toilet\r\nnecessaries into a hand-bag, and not three minutes after that voice had\r\nbeen heard, her slim form, hastily wrapped up from observation, might\r\nhave been seen passing out of the back door of Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s house. Thence\r\nshe skimmed up the garden-path, through the gap in the hedge, and into\r\nthe mossy cart-track under the trees which led into the depth of the\r\nwoods.\r\n\r\nThe leaves overhead were now in their latter green\xe2\x80\x94so opaque, that it\r\nwas darker at some of the densest spots than in winter-time, scarce a\r\ncrevice existing by which a ray could get down to the ground. But in\r\nopen places she could see well enough. Summer was ending: in the\r\ndaytime singing insects hung in every sunbeam; vegetation was heavy\r\nnightly with globes of dew; and after showers creeping damps and\r\ntwilight chills came up from the hollows. The plantations were always\r\nweird at this hour of eve\xe2\x80\x94more spectral far than in the leafless\r\nseason, when there were fewer masses and more minute lineality. The\r\nsmooth surfaces of glossy plants came out like weak, lidless eyes;\r\nthere were strange faces and figures from expiring lights that had\r\nsomehow wandered into the canopied obscurity; while now and then low\r\npeeps of the sky between the trunks were like sheeted shapes, and on\r\nthe tips of boughs sat faint cloven tongues.\r\n\r\nBut Grace\xe2\x80\x99s fear just now was not imaginative or spiritual, and she\r\nheeded these impressions but little. She went on as silently as she\r\ncould, avoiding the hollows wherein leaves had accumulated, and\r\nstepping upon soundless moss and grass-tufts. She paused breathlessly\r\nonce or twice, and fancied that she could hear, above the beat of her\r\nstrumming pulse, the vehicle containing Fitzpiers turning in at the\r\ngate of her father\xe2\x80\x99s premises. She hastened on again.\r\n\r\nThe Hintock woods owned by Mrs. Charmond were presently left behind,\r\nand those into which she next plunged were divided from the latter by a\r\nbank, from whose top the hedge had long ago perished\xe2\x80\x94starved for want\r\nof sun. It was with some caution that Grace now walked, though she was\r\nquite free from any of the commonplace timidities of her ordinary\r\npilgrimages to such spots. She feared no lurking harms, but that her\r\neffort would be all in vain, and her return to the house rendered\r\nimperative.\r\n\r\nShe had walked between three and four miles when that prescriptive\r\ncomfort and relief to wanderers in woods\xe2\x80\x94a distant light\xe2\x80\x94broke at last\r\nupon her searching eyes. It was so very small as to be almost sinister\r\nto a stranger, but to her it was what she sought. She pushed forward,\r\nand the dim outline of a dwelling was disclosed.\r\n\r\nThe house was a square cot of one story only, sloping up on all sides\r\nto a chimney in the midst. It had formerly been the home of a\r\ncharcoal-burner, in times when that fuel was still used in the county\r\nhouses. Its only appurtenance was a paled enclosure, there being no\r\ngarden, the shade of the trees preventing the growth of vegetables. She\r\nadvanced to the window whence the rays of light proceeded, and the\r\nshutters being as yet unclosed, she could survey the whole interior\r\nthrough the panes.\r\n\r\nThe room within was kitchen, parlor, and scullery all in one; the\r\nnatural sandstone floor was worn into hills and dales by long treading,\r\nso that none of the furniture stood level, and the table slanted like a\r\ndesk. A fire burned on the hearth, in front of which revolved the\r\nskinned carcass of a rabbit, suspended by a string from a nail. Leaning\r\nwith one arm on the mantle-shelf stood Winterborne, his eyes on the\r\nroasting animal, his face so rapt that speculation could build nothing\r\non it concerning his thoughts, more than that they were not with the\r\nscene before him. She thought his features had changed a little since\r\nshe saw them last. The fire-light did not enable her to perceive that\r\nthey were positively haggard.\r\n\r\nGrace\xe2\x80\x99s throat emitted a gasp of relief at finding the result so nearly\r\nas she had hoped. She went to the door and tapped lightly.\r\n\r\nHe seemed to be accustomed to the noises of woodpeckers, squirrels, and\r\nsuch small creatures, for he took no notice of her tiny signal, and she\r\nknocked again. This time he came and opened the door. When the light of\r\nthe room fell upon her face he started, and, hardly knowing what he\r\ndid, crossed the threshold to her, placing his hands upon her two arms,\r\nwhile surprise, joy, alarm, sadness, chased through him by turns. With\r\nGrace it was the same: even in this stress there was the fond fact that\r\nthey had met again. Thus they stood,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLong tears upon their faces, waxen white\r\nWith extreme sad delight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nHe broke the silence by saying in a whisper, \xe2\x80\x9cCome in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, Giles!\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, hurriedly, stepping yet farther back\r\nfrom the door. \xe2\x80\x9cI am passing by\xe2\x80\x94and I have called on you\xe2\x80\x94I won\xe2\x80\x99t enter.\r\nWill you help me? I am afraid. I want to get by a roundabout way to\r\nSherton, and so to Exbury. I have a school-fellow there\xe2\x80\x94but I cannot\r\nget to Sherton alone. Oh, if you will only accompany me a little way!\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t condemn me, Giles, and be offended! I was obliged to come to you\r\nbecause\xe2\x80\x94I have no other help here. Three months ago you were my lover;\r\nnow you are only my friend. The law has stepped in, and forbidden what\r\nwe thought of. It must not be. But we can act honestly, and yet you can\r\nbe my friend for one little hour? I have no other\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe could get no further. Covering her eyes with one hand, by an effort\r\nof repression she wept a silent trickle, without a sigh or sob.\r\nWinterborne took her other hand. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat has happened?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a stillness as of death, till Winterborne asked, \xe2\x80\x9cYou mean\r\nthis, Grace\xe2\x80\x94that I am to help you to get away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cAppearance is no matter, when the reality is right. I\r\nhave said to myself I can trust you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGiles knew from this that she did not suspect his treachery\xe2\x80\x94if it could\r\nbe called such\xe2\x80\x94earlier in the summer, when they met for the last time\r\nas lovers; and in the intensity of his contrition for that tender\r\nwrong, he determined to deserve her faith now at least, and so wipe out\r\nthat reproach from his conscience. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll come at once,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nlight a lantern.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe unhooked a dark-lantern from a nail under the eaves and she did not\r\nnotice how his hand shook with the slight strain, or dream that in\r\nmaking this offer he was taxing a convalescence which could ill afford\r\nsuch self-sacrifice. The lantern was lit, and they started.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first hundred yards of their course lay under motionless trees,\r\nwhose upper foliage began to hiss with falling drops of rain. By the\r\ntime that they emerged upon a glade it rained heavily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is awkward,\xe2\x80\x9d said Grace, with an effort to hide her concern.\r\n\r\nWinterborne stopped. \xe2\x80\x9cGrace,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, preserving a strictly business\r\nmanner which belied him, \xe2\x80\x9cyou cannot go to Sherton to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I must!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy? It is nine miles from here. It is almost an impossibility in this\r\nrain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue\xe2\x80\x94_why?_\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, mournfully, at the end of a silence. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\nis reputation to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow hearken,\xe2\x80\x9d said Giles. \xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94go back to your\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, no! Don\xe2\x80\x99t make me!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, piteously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen let us turn.\xe2\x80\x9d They slowly retraced their steps, and again stood\r\nbefore his door. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, this house from this moment is yours, and not\r\nmine,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, deliberately. \xe2\x80\x9cI have a place near by where I can stay\r\nvery well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer face had drooped. \xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured, as she saw the dilemma. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\nhave I done!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a smell of something burning within, and he looked through\r\nthe window. The rabbit that he had been cooking to coax a weak appetite\r\nwas beginning to char. \xe2\x80\x9cPlease go in and attend to it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cDo\r\nwhat you like. Now I leave. You will find everything about the hut that\r\nis necessary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Giles\xe2\x80\x94your supper,\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cAn out-house would do for\r\nme\xe2\x80\x94anything\xe2\x80\x94till to-morrow at day-break!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe signified a negative. \xe2\x80\x9cI tell you to go in\xe2\x80\x94you may catch agues out\r\nhere in your delicate state. You can give me my supper through the\r\nwindow, if you feel well enough. I\xe2\x80\x99ll wait a while.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe gently urged her to pass the door-way, and was relieved when he saw\r\nher within the room sitting down. Without so much as crossing the\r\nthreshold himself, he closed the door upon her, and turned the key in\r\nthe lock. Tapping at the window, he signified that she should open the\r\ncasement, and when she had done this he handed in the key to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are locked in,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cand your own mistress.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEven in her trouble she could not refrain from a faint smile at his\r\nscrupulousness, as she took the door-key.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you feel better?\xe2\x80\x9d he went on. \xe2\x80\x9cIf so, and you wish to give me some\r\nof your supper, please do. If not, it is of no importance. I can get\r\nsome elsewhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe grateful sense of his kindness stirred her to action, though she\r\nonly knew half what that kindness really was. At the end of some ten\r\nminutes she again came to the window, pushed it open, and said in a\r\nwhisper, \xe2\x80\x9cGiles!\xe2\x80\x9d He at once emerged from the shade, and saw that she\r\nwas preparing to hand him his share of the meal upon a plate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like to treat you so hardly,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured, with deep regret\r\nin her words as she heard the rain pattering on the leaves. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nsuppose it is best to arrange like this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, quickly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI feel that I could never have reached Sherton.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was impossible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you sure you have a snug place out there?\xe2\x80\x9d (With renewed\r\nmisgiving.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite. Have you found everything you want? I am afraid it is rather\r\nrough accommodation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan I notice defects? I have long passed that stage, and you know it,\r\nGiles, or you ought to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis eyes sadly contemplated her face as its pale responsiveness\r\nmodulated through a crowd of expressions that showed only too clearly\r\nto what a pitch she was strung. If ever Winterborne\xe2\x80\x99s heart fretted his\r\nbosom it was at this sight of a perfectly defenceless creature\r\nconditioned by such circumstances. He forgot his own agony in the\r\nsatisfaction of having at least found her a shelter. He took his plate\r\nand cup from her hands, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cNow I\xe2\x80\x99ll push the shutter to, and you\r\nwill find an iron pin on the inside, which you must fix into the bolt.\r\nDo not stir in the morning till I come and call you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe expressed an alarmed hope that he would not go very far away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no\xe2\x80\x94I shall be quite within hail,\xe2\x80\x9d said Winterborne.\r\n\r\nShe bolted the window as directed, and he retreated. His snug place\r\nproved to be a wretched little shelter of the roughest kind, formed of\r\nfour hurdles thatched with brake-fern. Underneath were dry sticks, hay,\r\nand other litter of the sort, upon which he sat down; and there in the\r\ndark tried to eat his meal. But his appetite was quite gone. He pushed\r\nthe plate aside, and shook up the hay and sacks, so as to form a rude\r\ncouch, on which he flung himself down to sleep, for it was getting\r\nlate.\r\n\r\nBut sleep he could not, for many reasons, of which not the least was\r\nthought of his charge. He sat up, and looked towards the cot through\r\nthe damp obscurity. With all its external features the same as usual,\r\nhe could scarcely believe that it contained the dear friend\xe2\x80\x94he would\r\nnot use a warmer name\xe2\x80\x94who had come to him so unexpectedly, and, he\r\ncould not help admitting, so rashly.\r\n\r\nHe had not ventured to ask her any particulars; but the position was\r\npretty clear without them. Though social law had negatived forever\r\ntheir opening paradise of the previous June, it was not without stoical\r\npride that he accepted the present trying conjuncture. There was one\r\nman on earth in whom she believed absolutely, and he was that man. That\r\nthis crisis could end in nothing but sorrow was a view for a moment\r\neffaced by this triumphant thought of her trust in him; and the purity\r\nof the affection with which he responded to that trust rendered him\r\nmore than proof against any frailty that besieged him in relation to\r\nher.\r\n\r\nThe rain, which had never ceased, now drew his attention by beginning\r\nto drop through the meagre screen that covered him. He rose to attempt\r\nsome remedy for this discomfort, but the trembling of his knees and the\r\nthrobbing of his pulse told him that in his weakness he was unable to\r\nfence against the storm, and he lay down to bear it as best he might.\r\nHe was angry with himself for his feebleness\xe2\x80\x94he who had been so strong.\r\nIt was imperative that she should know nothing of his present state,\r\nand to do that she must not see his face by daylight, for its color\r\nwould inevitably betray him.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, accordingly, when it was hardly light, he rose and\r\ndragged his stiff limbs about the precincts, preparing for her\r\neverything she could require for getting breakfast within. On the bench\r\noutside the window-sill he placed water, wood, and other necessaries,\r\nwriting with a piece of chalk beside them, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is best that I should\r\nnot see you. Put my breakfast on the bench.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock he tapped at her window, as he had promised,\r\nretreating at once, that she might not catch sight of him. But from his\r\nshelter under the boughs he could see her very well, when, in response\r\nto his signal, she opened the window and the light fell upon her face.\r\nThe languid largeness of her eyes showed that her sleep had been little\r\nmore than his own, and the pinkness of their lids, that her waking\r\nhours had not been free from tears.\r\n\r\nShe read the writing, seemed, he thought, disappointed, but took up the\r\nmaterials he had provided, evidently thinking him some way off. Giles\r\nwaited on, assured that a girl who, in spite of her culture, knew what\r\ncountry life was, would find no difficulty in the simple preparation of\r\ntheir food.\r\n\r\nWithin the cot it was all very much as he conjectured, though Grace had\r\nslept much longer than he. After the loneliness of the night, she would\r\nhave been glad to see him; but appreciating his feeling when she read\r\nthe writing, she made no attempt to recall him. She found abundance of\r\nprovisions laid in, his plan being to replenish his buttery weekly, and\r\nthis being the day after the victualling van had called from Sherton.\r\nWhen the meal was ready, she put what he required outside, as she had\r\ndone with the supper; and, notwithstanding her longing to see him,\r\nwithdrew from the window promptly, and left him to himself.\r\n\r\nIt had been a leaden dawn, and the rain now steadily renewed its fall.\r\nAs she heard no more of Winterborne, she concluded that he had gone\r\naway to his daily work, and forgotten that he had promised to accompany\r\nher to Sherton; an erroneous conclusion, for he remained all day, by\r\nforce of his condition, within fifty yards of where she was. The\r\nmorning wore on; and in her doubt when to start, and how to travel, she\r\nlingered yet, keeping the door carefully bolted, lest an intruder\r\nshould discover her. Locked in this place, she was comparatively safe,\r\nat any rate, and doubted if she would be safe elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe humid gloom of an ordinary wet day was doubled by the shade and\r\ndrip of the leafage. Autumn, this year, was coming in with rains.\r\nGazing, in her enforced idleness, from the one window of the\r\nliving-room, she could see various small members of the animal\r\ncommunity that lived unmolested there\xe2\x80\x94creatures of hair, fluff, and\r\nscale, the toothed kind and the billed kind; underground creatures,\r\njointed and ringed\xe2\x80\x94circumambulating the hut, under the impression that,\r\nGiles having gone away, nobody was there; and eying it inquisitively\r\nwith a view to winter-quarters. Watching these neighbors, who knew\r\nneither law nor sin, distracted her a little from her trouble; and she\r\nmanaged to while away some portion of the afternoon by putting Giles\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhome in order and making little improvements which she deemed that he\r\nwould value when she was gone.\r\n\r\nOnce or twice she fancied that she heard a faint noise amid the trees,\r\nresembling a cough; but as it never came any nearer she concluded that\r\nit was a squirrel or a bird.\r\n\r\nAt last the daylight lessened, and she made up a larger fire for the\r\nevenings were chilly. As soon as it was too dark\xe2\x80\x94which was\r\ncomparatively early\xe2\x80\x94to discern the human countenance in this place of\r\nshadows, there came to the window to her great delight, a tapping which\r\nshe knew from its method to be Giles\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nShe opened the casement instantly, and put out her hand to him, though\r\nshe could only just perceive his outline. He clasped her fingers, and\r\nshe noticed the heat of his palm and its shakiness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has been walking fast, in order to get here quickly,\xe2\x80\x9d she thought.\r\nHow could she know that he had just crawled out from the straw of the\r\nshelter hard by; and that the heat of his hand was feverishness?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear, good Giles!\xe2\x80\x9d she burst out, impulsively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnybody would have done it for you,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Winterborne, with as much\r\nmatter-of-fact as he could summon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout my getting to Exbury?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been thinking,\xe2\x80\x9d responded Giles, with tender deference, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\nyou had better stay where you are for the present, if you wish not to\r\nbe caught. I need not tell you that the place is yours as long as you\r\nlike; and perhaps in a day or two, finding you absent, he will go away.\r\nAt any rate, in two or three days I could do anything to assist\xe2\x80\x94such as\r\nmake inquiries, or go a great way towards Sherton-Abbas with you; for\r\nthe cider season will soon be coming on, and I want to run down to the\r\nVale to see how the crops are, and I shall go by the Sherton road. But\r\nfor a day or two I am busy here.\xe2\x80\x9d He was hoping that by the time\r\nmentioned he would be strong enough to engage himself actively on her\r\nbehalf. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope you do not feel over-much melancholy in being a\r\nprisoner?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe declared that she did not mind it; but she sighed.\r\n\r\nFrom long acquaintance they could read each other\xe2\x80\x99s heart-symptoms like\r\nbooks of large type. \xe2\x80\x9cI fear you are sorry you came,\xe2\x80\x9d said Giles, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nthat you think I should have advised you more firmly than I did not to\r\nstay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, dear, dear friend,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Grace, with a heaving bosom.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t think that that is what I regret. What I regret is my enforced\r\ntreatment of you\xe2\x80\x94dislodging you, excluding you from your own house. Why\r\nshould I not speak out? You know what I feel for you\xe2\x80\x94what I have felt\r\nfor no other living man, what I shall never feel for a man again! But\r\nas I have vowed myself to somebody else than you, and cannot be\r\nreleased, I must behave as I do behave, and keep that vow. I am not\r\nbound to him by any divine law, after what he has done; but I have\r\npromised, and I will pay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe rest of the evening was passed in his handing her such things as\r\nshe would require the next day, and casual remarks thereupon, an\r\noccupation which diverted her mind to some degree from pathetic views\r\nof her attitude towards him, and of her life in general. The only\r\ninfringement\xe2\x80\x94if infringement it could be called\xe2\x80\x94of his predetermined\r\nbearing towards her was an involuntary pressing of her hand to his lips\r\nwhen she put it through the casement to bid him good-night. He knew she\r\nwas weeping, though he could not see her tears.\r\n\r\nShe again entreated his forgiveness for so selfishly appropriating the\r\ncottage. But it would only be for a day or two more, she thought, since\r\ngo she must.\r\n\r\nHe replied, yearningly, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t like you to go away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Giles,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cI know\xe2\x80\x94I know! But\xe2\x80\x94I am a woman, and you are a\r\nman. I cannot speak more plainly. \xe2\x80\x98Whatsoever things are pure,\r\nwhatsoever things are of good report\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94you know what is in my mind,\r\nbecause you know me so well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Grace, yes. I do not at all mean that the question between us has\r\nnot been settled by the fact of your marriage turning out hopelessly\r\nunalterable. I merely meant\xe2\x80\x94well, a feeling no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn a week, at the outside, I should be discovered if I stayed here:\r\nand I think that by law he could compel me to return to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; perhaps you are right. Go when you wish, dear Grace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis last words that evening were a hopeful remark that all might be\r\nwell with her yet; that Mr. Fitzpiers would not intrude upon her life,\r\nif he found that his presence cost her so much pain. Then the window\r\nwas closed, the shutters folded, and the rustle of his footsteps died\r\naway.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had she retired to rest that night than the wind began to\r\nrise, and, after a few prefatory blasts, to be accompanied by rain. The\r\nwind grew more violent, and as the storm went on, it was difficult to\r\nbelieve that no opaque body, but only an invisible colorless thing, was\r\ntrampling and climbing over the roof, making branches creak, springing\r\nout of the trees upon the chimney, popping its head into the flue, and\r\nshrieking and blaspheming at every corner of the walls. As in the old\r\nstory, the assailant was a spectre which could be felt but not seen.\r\nShe had never before been so struck with the devilry of a gusty night\r\nin a wood, because she had never been so entirely alone in spirit as\r\nshe was now. She seemed almost to be apart from herself\xe2\x80\x94a vacuous\r\nduplicate only. The recent self of physical animation and clear\r\nintentions was not there.\r\n\r\nSometimes a bough from an adjoining tree was swayed so low as to smite\r\nthe roof in the manner of a gigantic hand smiting the mouth of an\r\nadversary, to be followed by a trickle of rain, as blood from the\r\nwound. To all this weather Giles must be more or less exposed; how\r\nmuch, she did not know.\r\n\r\nAt last Grace could hardly endure the idea of such a hardship in\r\nrelation to him. Whatever he was suffering, it was she who had caused\r\nit; he vacated his house on account of her. She was not worth such\r\nself-sacrifice; she should not have accepted it of him. And then, as\r\nher anxiety increased with increasing thought, there returned upon her\r\nmind some incidents of her late intercourse with him, which she had\r\nheeded but little at the time. The look of his face\xe2\x80\x94what had there been\r\nabout his face which seemed different from its appearance as of yore?\r\nWas it not thinner, less rich in hue, less like that of ripe autumn\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbrother to whom she had formerly compared him? And his voice; she had\r\ndistinctly noticed a change in tone. And his gait; surely it had been\r\nfeebler, stiffer, more like the gait of a weary man. That slight\r\noccasional noise she had heard in the day, and attributed to squirrels,\r\nit might have been his cough after all.\r\n\r\nThus conviction took root in her perturbed mind that Winterborne was\r\nill, or had been so, and that he had carefully concealed his condition\r\nfrom her that she might have no scruples about accepting a hospitality\r\nwhich by the nature of the case expelled her entertainer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy own, own, true l\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94, my dear kind friend!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried to herself.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it shall not be\xe2\x80\x94it shall not be!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe hastily wrapped herself up, and obtained a light, with which she\r\nentered the adjoining room, the cot possessing only one floor. Setting\r\ndown the candle on the table here, she went to the door with the key in\r\nher hand, and placed it in the lock. Before turning it she paused, her\r\nfingers still clutching it; and pressing her other hand to her\r\nforehead, she fell into agitating thought.\r\n\r\nA tattoo on the window, caused by the tree-droppings blowing against\r\nit, brought her indecision to a close. She turned the key and opened\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\nThe darkness was intense, seeming to touch her pupils like a substance.\r\nShe only now became aware how heavy the rainfall had been and was; the\r\ndripping of the eaves splashed like a fountain. She stood listening\r\nwith parted lips, and holding the door in one hand, till her eyes,\r\ngrowing accustomed to the obscurity, discerned the wild brandishing of\r\ntheir boughs by the adjoining trees. At last she cried loudly with an\r\neffort, \xe2\x80\x9cGiles! you may come in!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was no immediate answer to her cry, and overpowered by her own\r\ntemerity, Grace retreated quickly, shut the door, and stood looking on\r\nthe floor. But it was not for long. She again lifted the latch, and\r\nwith far more determination than at first.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGiles, Giles!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, with the full strength of her voice, and\r\nwithout any of the shamefacedness that had characterized her first cry.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, come in\xe2\x80\x94come in! Where are you? I have been wicked. I have thought\r\ntoo much of myself! Do you hear? I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to keep you out any\r\nlonger. I cannot bear that you should suffer so. Gi-i-iles!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA reply! It was a reply! Through the darkness and wind a voice reached\r\nher, floating upon the weather as though a part of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere I am\xe2\x80\x94all right. Don\xe2\x80\x99t trouble about me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you want to come in? Are you not wet? _Come to me! I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind\r\nwhat they say, or what they think any more._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am all right,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not necessary for me to come.\r\nGood-night! good-night!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrace sighed, turned and shut the door slowly. Could she have been\r\nmistaken about his health? Perhaps, after all, she had perceived a\r\nchange in him because she had not seen him for so long. Time sometimes\r\ndid his ageing work in jerks, as she knew. Well, she had done all she\r\ncould. He would not come in. She retired to rest again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning Grace was at the window early. She felt determined to\r\nsee him somehow that day, and prepared his breakfast eagerly. Eight\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock struck, and she had remembered that he had not come to arouse\r\nher by a knocking, as usual, her own anxiety having caused her to stir.\r\n\r\nThe breakfast was set in its place without. But he did not arrive to\r\ntake it; and she waited on. Nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock arrived, and the breakfast was\r\ncold; and still there was no Giles. A thrush, that had been repeating\r\nitself a good deal on an opposite bush for some time, came and took a\r\nmorsel from the plate and bolted it, waited, looked around, and took\r\nanother. At ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock she drew in the tray, and sat down to her own\r\nsolitary meal. He must have been called away on business early, the\r\nrain having cleared off.\r\n\r\nYet she would have liked to assure herself, by thoroughly exploring the\r\nprecincts of the hut, that he was nowhere in its vicinity; but as the\r\nday was comparatively fine, the dread lest some stray passenger or\r\nwoodman should encounter her in such a reconnoitre paralyzed her wish.\r\nThe solitude was further accentuated to-day by the stopping of the\r\nclock for want of winding, and the fall into the chimney-corner of\r\nflakes of soot loosened by the rains. At noon she heard a slight\r\nrustling outside the window, and found that it was caused by an eft\r\nwhich had crept out of the leaves to bask in the last sun-rays that\r\nwould be worth having till the following May.\r\n\r\nShe continually peeped out through the lattice, but could see little.\r\nIn front lay the brown leaves of last year, and upon them some\r\nyellowish-green ones of this season that had been prematurely blown\r\ndown by the gale. Above stretched an old beech, with vast armpits, and\r\ngreat pocket-holes in its sides where branches had been amputated in\r\npast times; a black slug was trying to climb it. Dead boughs were\r\nscattered about like ichthyosauri in a museum, and beyond them were\r\nperishing woodbine stems resembling old ropes.\r\n\r\nFrom the other window all she could see were more trees, jacketed with\r\nlichen and stockinged with moss. At their roots were stemless yellow\r\nfungi like lemons and apricots, and tall fungi with more stem than\r\nstool. Next were more trees close together, wrestling for existence,\r\ntheir branches disfigured with wounds resulting from their mutual\r\nrubbings and blows. It was the struggle between these neighbors that\r\nshe had heard in the night. Beneath them were the rotting stumps of\r\nthose of the group that had been vanquished long ago, rising from their\r\nmossy setting like decayed teeth from green gums. Farther on were other\r\ntufts of moss in islands divided by the shed leaves\xe2\x80\x94variety upon\r\nvariety, dark green and pale green; moss-like little fir-trees, like\r\nplush, like malachite stars, like nothing on earth except moss.\r\n\r\nThe strain upon Grace\xe2\x80\x99s mind in various ways was so great on this the\r\nmost desolate day she had passed there that she felt it would be\r\nwell-nigh impossible to spend another in such circumstances. The\r\nevening came at last; the sun, when its chin was on the earth, found an\r\nopening through which to pierce the shade, and stretched irradiated\r\ngauzes across the damp atmosphere, making the wet trunks shine, and\r\nthrowing splotches of such ruddiness on the leaves beneath the beech\r\nthat they were turned to gory hues. When night at last arrived, and\r\nwith it the time for his return, she was nearly broken down with\r\nsuspense.\r\n\r\nThe simple evening meal, partly tea, partly supper, which Grace had\r\nprepared, stood waiting upon the hearth; and yet Giles did not come. It\r\nwas now nearly twenty-four hours since she had seen him. As the room\r\ngrew darker, and only the firelight broke against the gloom of the\r\nwalls, she was convinced that it would be beyond her staying power to\r\npass the night without hearing from him or from somebody. Yet eight\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock drew on, and his form at the window did not appear.\r\n\r\nThe meal remained untasted. Suddenly rising from before the hearth of\r\nsmouldering embers, where she had been crouching with her hands clasped\r\nover her knees, she crossed the room, unlocked the door, and listened.\r\nEvery breath of wind had ceased with the decline of day, but the rain\r\nhad resumed the steady dripping of the night before. Grace might have\r\nstood there five minutes when she fancied she heard that old sound, a\r\ncough, at no great distance; and it was presently repeated. If it were\r\nWinterborne\xe2\x80\x99s, he must be near her; why, then, had he not visited her?\r\n\r\nA horrid misgiving that he could not visit her took possession of\r\nGrace, and she looked up anxiously for the lantern, which was hanging\r\nabove her head. To light it and go in the direction of the sound would\r\nbe the obvious way to solve the dread problem; but the conditions made\r\nher hesitate, and in a moment a cold sweat pervaded her at further\r\nsounds from the same quarter.\r\n\r\nThey were low mutterings; at first like persons in conversation, but\r\ngradually resolving themselves into varieties of one voice. It was an\r\nendless monologue, like that we sometimes hear from inanimate nature in\r\ndeep secret places where water flows, or where ivy leaves flap against\r\nstones; but by degrees she was convinced that the voice was\r\nWinterborne\xe2\x80\x99s. Yet who could be his listener, so mute and patient; for\r\nthough he argued so rapidly and persistently, nobody replied.\r\n\r\nA dreadful enlightenment spread through the mind of Grace. \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\ncried, in her anguish, as she hastily prepared herself to go out, \xe2\x80\x9chow\r\nselfishly correct I am always\xe2\x80\x94too, too correct! Cruel propriety is\r\nkilling the dearest heart that ever woman clasped to her own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile speaking thus to herself she had lit the lantern, and hastening\r\nout without further thought, took the direction whence the mutterings\r\nhad proceeded. The course was marked by a little path, which ended at a\r\ndistance of about forty yards in a small erection of hurdles, not much\r\nlarger than a shock of corn, such as were frequent in the woods and\r\ncopses when the cutting season was going on. It was too slight even to\r\nbe called a hovel, and was not high enough to stand upright in;\r\nappearing, in short, to be erected for the temporary shelter of fuel.\r\nThe side towards Grace was open, and turning the light upon the\r\ninterior, she beheld what her prescient fear had pictured in snatches\r\nall the way thither.\r\n\r\nUpon the straw within, Winterborne lay in his clothes, just as she had\r\nseen him during the whole of her stay here, except that his hat was\r\noff, and his hair matted and wild.\r\n\r\nBoth his clothes and the straw were saturated with rain. His arms were\r\nflung over his head; his face was flushed to an unnatural crimson. His\r\neyes had a burning brightness, and though they met her own, she\r\nperceived that he did not recognize her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my Giles,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat have I done to you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut she stopped no longer even to reproach herself. She saw that the\r\nfirst thing to be thought of was to get him indoors.\r\n\r\nHow Grace performed that labor she never could have exactly explained.\r\nBut by dint of clasping her arms round him, rearing him into a sitting\r\nposture, and straining her strength to the uttermost, she put him on\r\none of the hurdles that was loose alongside, and taking the end of it\r\nin both her hands, dragged him along the path to the entrance of the\r\nhut, and, after a pause for breath, in at the door-way.\r\n\r\nIt was somewhat singular that Giles in his semi-conscious state\r\nacquiesced unresistingly in all that she did. But he never for a moment\r\nrecognized her\xe2\x80\x94continuing his rapid conversation to himself, and\r\nseeming to look upon her as some angel, or other supernatural creature\r\nof the visionary world in which he was mentally living. The undertaking\r\noccupied her more than ten minutes; but by that time, to her great\r\nthankfulness, he was in the inner room, lying on the bed, his damp\r\nouter clothing removed.\r\n\r\nThen the unhappy Grace regarded him by the light of the candle. There\r\nwas something in his look which agonized her, in the rush of his\r\nthoughts, accelerating their speed from minute to minute. He seemed to\r\nbe passing through the universe of ideas like a comet\xe2\x80\x94erratic,\r\ninapprehensible, untraceable.\r\n\r\nGrace\xe2\x80\x99s distraction was almost as great as his. In a few moments she\r\nfirmly believed he was dying. Unable to withstand her impulse, she\r\nknelt down beside him, kissed his hands and his face and his hair,\r\nexclaiming, in a low voice, \xe2\x80\x9cHow could I? How could I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer timid morality had, indeed, underrated his chivalry till now,\r\nthough she knew him so well. The purity of his nature, his freedom from\r\nthe grosser passions, his scrupulous delicacy, had never been fully\r\nunderstood by Grace till this strange self-sacrifice in lonely\r\njuxtaposition to her own person was revealed. The perception of it\r\nadded something that was little short of reverence to the deep\r\naffection for him of a woman who, herself, had more of Artemis than of\r\nAphrodite in her constitution.\r\n\r\nAll that a tender nurse could do, Grace did; and the power to express\r\nher solicitude in action, unconscious though the sufferer was, brought\r\nher mournful satisfaction. She bathed his hot head, wiped his\r\nperspiring hands, moistened his lips, cooled his fiery eyelids, sponged\r\nhis heated skin, and administered whatever she could find in the house\r\nthat the imagination could conceive as likely to be in any way\r\nalleviating. That she might have been the cause, or partially the\r\ncause, of all this, interfused misery with her sorrow.\r\n\r\nSix months before this date a scene, almost similar in its mechanical\r\nparts, had been enacted at Hintock House. It was between a pair of\r\npersons most intimately connected in their lives with these. Outwardly\r\nlike as it had been, it was yet infinite in spiritual difference,\r\nthough a woman\xe2\x80\x99s devotion had been common to both.\r\n\r\nGrace rose from her attitude of affection, and, bracing her energies,\r\nsaw that something practical must immediately be done. Much as she\r\nwould have liked, in the emotion of the moment, to keep him entirely to\r\nherself, medical assistance was necessary while there remained a\r\npossibility of preserving him alive. Such assistance was fatal to her\r\nown concealment; but even had the chance of benefiting him been less\r\nthan it was, she would have run the hazard for his sake. The question\r\nwas, where should she get a medical man, competent and near?\r\n\r\nThere was one such man, and only one, within accessible distance; a man\r\nwho, if it were possible to save Winterborne\xe2\x80\x99s life, had the brain most\r\nlikely to do it. If human pressure could bring him, that man ought to\r\nbe brought to the sick Giles\xe2\x80\x99s side. The attempt should be made.\r\n\r\nYet she dreaded to leave her patient, and the minutes raced past, and\r\nyet she postponed her departure. At last, when it was after eleven\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock, Winterborne fell into a fitful sleep, and it seemed to afford\r\nher an opportunity.\r\n\r\nShe hastily made him as comfortable as she could, put on her things,\r\ncut a new candle from the bunch hanging in the cupboard, and having set\r\nit up, and placed it so that the light did not fall upon his eyes, she\r\nclosed the door and started.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of Winterborne seemed to keep her company and banish all\r\nsense of darkness from her mind. The rains had imparted a\r\nphosphorescence to the pieces of touchwood and rotting leaves that lay\r\nabout her path, which, as scattered by her feet, spread abroad like\r\nspilt milk. She would not run the hazard of losing her way by plunging\r\ninto any short, unfrequented track through the denser parts of the\r\nwoodland, but followed a more open course, which eventually brought her\r\nto the highway. Once here, she ran along with great speed, animated by\r\na devoted purpose which had much about it that was stoical; and it was\r\nwith scarcely any faltering of spirit that, after an hour\xe2\x80\x99s progress,\r\nshe passed over Rubdown Hill, and onward towards that same Hintock, and\r\nthat same house, out of which she had fled a few days before in\r\nirresistible alarm. But that had happened which, above all other things\r\nof chance and change, could make her deliberately frustrate her plan of\r\nflight and sink all regard of personal consequences.\r\n\r\nOne speciality of Fitzpiers\xe2\x80\x99s was respected by Grace as much as\r\never\xe2\x80\x94his professional skill. In this she was right. Had his persistence\r\nequalled his insight, instead of being the spasmodic and fitful thing\r\nit was, fame and fortune need never have remained a wish with him. His\r\nfreedom from conventional errors and crusted prejudices had, indeed,\r\nbeen such as to retard rather than accelerate his advance in Hintock\r\nand its neighborhood, where people could not believe that nature\r\nherself effected cures, and that the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s business was only to\r\nsmooth the way.\r\n\r\nIt was past midnight when Grace arrived opposite her father\xe2\x80\x99s house,\r\nnow again temporarily occupied by her husband, unless he had already\r\ngone away. Ever since her emergence from the denser plantations about\r\nWinterborne\xe2\x80\x99s residence a pervasive lightness had hung in the damp\r\nautumn sky, in spite of the vault of cloud, signifying that a moon of\r\nsome age was shining above its arch. The two white gates were distinct,\r\nand the white balls on the pillars, and the puddles and damp ruts left\r\nby the recent rain, had a cold, corpse-eyed luminousness. She entered\r\nby the lower gate, and crossed the quadrangle to the wing wherein the\r\napartments that had been hers since her marriage were situate, till she\r\nstood under a window which, if her husband were in the house, gave\r\nlight to his bedchamber.\r\n\r\nShe faltered, and paused with her hand on her heart, in spite of\r\nherself. Could she call to her presence the very cause of all her\r\nforegoing troubles? Alas!\xe2\x80\x94old Jones was seven miles off; Giles was\r\npossibly dying\xe2\x80\x94what else could she do?\r\n\r\nIt was in a perspiration, wrought even more by consciousness than by\r\nexercise, that she picked up some gravel, threw it at the panes, and\r\nwaited to see the result. The night-bell which had been fixed when\r\nFitzpiers first took up his residence there still remained; but as it\r\nhad fallen into disuse with the collapse of his practice, and his\r\nelopement, she did not venture to pull it now.\r\n\r\nWhoever slept in the room had heard her signal, slight as it was. In\r\nhalf a minute the window was opened, and a voice said \xe2\x80\x9cYes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ninquiringly. Grace recognized her husband in the speaker at once. Her\r\neffort was now to disguise her own accents.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoctor,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in as unusual a tone as she could command, \xe2\x80\x9ca man\r\nis dangerously ill in One-chimney Hut, out towards Delborough, and you\r\nmust go to him at once\xe2\x80\x94in all mercy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will, readily.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe alacrity, surprise, and pleasure expressed in his reply amazed her\r\nfor a moment. But, in truth, they denoted the sudden relief of a man\r\nwho, having got back in a mood of contrition, from erratic abandonment\r\nto fearful joys, found the soothing routine of professional practice\r\nunexpectedly opening anew to him. The highest desire of his soul just\r\nnow was for a respectable life of painstaking. If this, his first\r\nsummons since his return, had been to attend upon a cat or dog, he\r\nwould scarcely have refused it in the circumstances.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know the way?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne-chimney Hut,\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\xe2\x80\x94immediately!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fitzpiers.\r\n\r\nGrace remained no longer. She passed out of the white gate without\r\nslamming it, and hastened on her way back. Her husband, then, had\r\nre-entered her father\xe2\x80\x99s house. How he had been able to effect a\r\nreconciliation with the old man, what were the terms of the treaty\r\nbetween them, she could not so much as conjecture. Some sort of truce\r\nmust have been entered into, that was all she could say. But close as\r\nthe question lay to her own life, there was a more urgent one which\r\nbanished it; and she traced her steps quickly along the meandering\r\ntrack-ways.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Fitzpiers was preparing to leave the house. The state of his\r\nmind, over and above his professional zeal, was peculiar. At Grace\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfirst remark he had not recognized or suspected her presence; but as\r\nshe went on, he was awakened to the great resemblance of the speaker\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvoice to his wife\xe2\x80\x99s. He had taken in such good faith the statement of\r\nthe household on his arrival, that she had gone on a visit for a time\r\nbecause she could not at once bring her mind to be reconciled to him,\r\nthat he could not quite actually believe this comer to be she. It was\r\none of the features of Fitzpiers\xe2\x80\x99s repentant humor at this date that,\r\non receiving the explanation of her absence, he had made no attempt to\r\noutrage her feelings by following her; though nobody had informed him\r\nhow very shortly her departure had preceded his entry, and of all that\r\nmight have been inferred from her precipitancy.\r\n\r\nMelbury, after much alarm and consideration, had decided not to follow\r\nher either. He sympathized with her flight, much as he deplored it;\r\nmoreover, the tragic color of the antecedent events that he had been a\r\ngreat means of creating checked his instinct to interfere. He prayed\r\nand trusted that she had got into no danger on her way (as he supposed)\r\nto Sherton, and thence to Exbury, if that were the place she had gone\r\nto, forbearing all inquiry which the strangeness of her departure would\r\nhave made natural. A few months before this time a performance by Grace\r\nof one-tenth the magnitude of this would have aroused him to unwonted\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\nIt was in the same spirit that he had tacitly assented to Fitzpiers\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndomicilation there. The two men had not met face to face, but Mrs.\r\nMelbury had proposed herself as an intermediary, who made the surgeon\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nre-entrance comparatively easy to him. Everything was provisional, and\r\nnobody asked questions. Fitzpiers had come in the performance of a plan\r\nof penitence, which had originated in circumstances hereafter to be\r\nexplained; his self-humiliation to the very bass-string was deliberate;\r\nand as soon as a call reached him from the bedside of a dying man his\r\ndesire was to set to work and do as much good as he could with the\r\nleast possible fuss or show. He therefore refrained from calling up a\r\nstableman to get ready any horse or gig, and set out for One-chimney\r\nHut on foot, as Grace had done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nShe re-entered the hut, flung off her bonnet and cloak, and approached\r\nthe sufferer. He had begun anew those terrible mutterings, and his\r\nhands were cold. As soon as she saw him there returned to her that\r\nagony of mind which the stimulus of her journey had thrown off for a\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nCould he really be dying? She bathed him, kissed him, forgot all things\r\nbut the fact that lying there before her was he who had loved her more\r\nthan the mere lover would have loved; had martyred himself for her\r\ncomfort, cared more for her self-respect than she had thought of\r\ncaring. This mood continued till she heard quick, smart footsteps\r\nwithout; she knew whose footsteps they were.\r\n\r\nGrace sat on the inside of the bed against the wall, holding Giles\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhand, so that when her husband entered the patient lay between herself\r\nand him. He stood transfixed at first, noticing Grace only. Slowly he\r\ndropped his glance and discerned who the prostrate man was. Strangely\r\nenough, though Grace\xe2\x80\x99s distaste for her husband\xe2\x80\x99s company had amounted\r\nalmost to dread, and culminated in actual flight, at this moment her\r\nlast and least feeling was personal. Sensitive femininity was eclipsed\r\nby self-effacing purpose, and that it was a husband who stood there was\r\nforgotten. The first look that possessed her face was relief;\r\nsatisfaction at the presence of the physician obliterated thought of\r\nthe man, which only returned in the form of a sub-consciousness that\r\ndid not interfere with her words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he dying\xe2\x80\x94is there any hope?\xe2\x80\x9d she cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGrace!\xe2\x80\x9d said Fitzpiers, in an indescribable whisper\xe2\x80\x94more than\r\ninvocating, if not quite deprecatory.\r\n\r\nHe was arrested by the spectacle, not so much in its intrinsic\r\ncharacter\xe2\x80\x94though that was striking enough to a man who called himself\r\nthe husband of the sufferer\xe2\x80\x99s friend and nurse\xe2\x80\x94but in its character as\r\nthe counterpart of one that had its hour many months before, in which\r\nhe had figured as the patient, and the woman had been Felice Charmond.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he in great danger\xe2\x80\x94can you save him?\xe2\x80\x9d she cried again.\r\n\r\nFitzpiers aroused himself, came a little nearer, and examined\r\nWinterborne as he stood. His inspection was concluded in a mere glance.\r\nBefore he spoke he looked at her contemplatively as to the effect of\r\nhis coming words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is dying,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with dry precision.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing can be done, by me or any other man. It will soon be all over.\r\nThe extremities are dead already.\xe2\x80\x9d His eyes still remained fixed on\r\nher; the conclusion to which he had come seeming to end his interest,\r\nprofessional and otherwise, in Winterborne forever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it cannot be! He was well three days ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot well, I suspect. This seems like a secondary attack, which has\r\nfollowed some previous illness\xe2\x80\x94possibly typhoid\xe2\x80\x94it may have been months\r\nago, or recently.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\x94he was not well\xe2\x80\x94you are right. He was ill\xe2\x80\x94he was ill when I came.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was nothing more to do or say. She crouched down at the side of\r\nthe bed, and Fitzpiers took a seat. Thus they remained in silence, and\r\nlong as it lasted she never turned her eyes, or apparently her\r\nthoughts, at all to her husband. He occasionally murmured, with\r\nautomatic authority, some slight directions for alleviating the pain of\r\nthe dying man, which she mechanically obeyed, bending over him during\r\nthe intervals in silent tears.\r\n\r\nWinterborne never recovered consciousness of what was passing; and that\r\nhe was going became soon perceptible also to her. In less than an hour\r\nthe delirium ceased; then there was an interval of somnolent\r\npainlessness and soft breathing, at the end of which Winterborne passed\r\nquietly away.\r\n\r\nThen Fitzpiers broke the silence. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you lived here long?\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\nGrace was wild with sorrow\xe2\x80\x94with all that had befallen her\xe2\x80\x94with the\r\ncruelties that had attacked her\xe2\x80\x94with life\xe2\x80\x94with Heaven. She answered at\r\nrandom. \xe2\x80\x9cYes. By what right do you ask?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t think I claim any right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fitzpiers, sadly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is for you\r\nto do and say what you choose. I admit, quite as much as you feel, that\r\nI am a vagabond\xe2\x80\x94a brute\xe2\x80\x94not worthy to possess the smallest fragment of\r\nyou. But here I am, and I have happened to take sufficient interest in\r\nyou to make that inquiry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is everything to me!\xe2\x80\x9d said Grace, hardly heeding her husband, and\r\nlaying her hand reverently on the dead man\xe2\x80\x99s eyelids, where she kept it\r\na long time, pressing down their lashes with gentle touches, as if she\r\nwere stroking a little bird.\r\n\r\nHe watched her a while, and then glanced round the chamber where his\r\neyes fell upon a few dressing necessaries that she had brought.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGrace\xe2\x80\x94if I may call you so,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI have been already humiliated\r\nalmost to the depths. I have come back since you refused to join me\r\nelsewhere\xe2\x80\x94I have entered your father\xe2\x80\x99s house, and borne all that that\r\ncost me without flinching, because I have felt that I deserved\r\nhumiliation. But is there a yet greater humiliation in store for me?\r\nYou say you have been living here\xe2\x80\x94that he is everything to you. Am I to\r\ndraw from that the obvious, the extremest inference?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTriumph at any price is sweet to men and women\xe2\x80\x94especially the latter.\r\nIt was her first and last opportunity of repaying him for the cruel\r\ncontumely which she had borne at his hands so docilely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered; and there was that in her subtly compounded nature\r\nwhich made her feel a thrill of pride as she did so.\r\n\r\nYet the moment after she had so mightily belied her character she half\r\nrepented. Her husband had turned as white as the wall behind him. It\r\nseemed as if all that remained to him of life and spirit had been\r\nabstracted at a stroke. Yet he did not move, and in his efforts at\r\nself-control closed his mouth together as a vice. His determination was\r\nfairly successful, though she saw how very much greater than she had\r\nexpected her triumph had been. Presently he looked across at\r\nWinterborne.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould it startle you to hear,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as if he hardly had breath to\r\nutter the words, \xe2\x80\x9cthat she who was to me what he was to you is dead\r\nalso?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDead\xe2\x80\x94_she_ dead?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Grace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Felice Charmond is where this young man is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever!\xe2\x80\x9d said Grace, vehemently.\r\n\r\nHe went on without heeding the insinuation: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I came back to try to\r\nmake it up with you\xe2\x80\x94but\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFitzpiers rose, and moved across the room to go away, looking downward\r\nwith the droop of a man whose hope was turned to apathy, if not\r\ndespair. In going round the door his eye fell upon her once more. She\r\nwas still bending over the body of Winterborne, her face close to the\r\nyoung man\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you been kissing him during his illness?\xe2\x80\x9d asked her husband.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince his fevered state set in?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn his lips?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you will do well to take a few drops of this in water as soon as\r\npossible.\xe2\x80\x9d He drew a small phial from his pocket and returned to offer\r\nit to her.\r\n\r\nGrace shook her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you don\xe2\x80\x99t do as I tell you you may soon be like him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care. I wish to die.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll put it here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fitzpiers, placing the bottle on a ledge\r\nbeside him. \xe2\x80\x9cThe sin of not having warned you will not be upon my head\r\nat any rate, among my other sins. I am now going, and I will send\r\nsomebody to you. Your father does not know that you are here, so I\r\nsuppose I shall be bound to tell him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFitzpiers left the cot, and the stroke of his feet was soon immersed in\r\nthe silence that pervaded the spot. Grace remained kneeling and\r\nweeping, she hardly knew how long, and then she sat up, covered poor\r\nGiles\xe2\x80\x99s features, and went towards the door where her husband had\r\nstood. No sign of any other comer greeted her ear, the only perceptible\r\nsounds being the tiny cracklings of the dead leaves, which, like a\r\nfeather-bed, had not yet done rising to their normal level where\r\nindented by the pressure of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s receding footsteps. It\r\nreminded her that she had been struck with the change in his aspect;\r\nthe extremely intellectual look that had always been in his face was\r\nwrought to a finer phase by thinness, and a care-worn dignity had been\r\nsuperadded. She returned to Winterborne\xe2\x80\x99s side, and during her\r\nmeditations another tread drew near the door, entered the outer room,\r\nand halted at the entrance of the chamber where Grace was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x94Marty!\xe2\x80\x9d said Grace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I have heard,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marty, whose demeanor had lost all its\r\ngirlishness under the stroke that seemed almost literally to have\r\nbruised her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe died for me!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Grace, heavily.\r\n\r\nMarty did not fully comprehend; and she answered, \xe2\x80\x9cHe belongs to\r\nneither of us now, and your beauty is no more powerful with him than my\r\nplainness. I have come to help you, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. He never cared for me, and\r\nhe cared much for you; but he cares for us both alike now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh don\xe2\x80\x99t, don\xe2\x80\x99t, Marty!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarty said no more, but knelt over Winterborne from the other side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you meet my hus\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Fitzpiers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen what brought you here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI come this way sometimes. I have got to go to the farther side of the\r\nwood this time of the year, and am obliged to get there before four\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning, to begin heating the oven for the early baking.\r\nI have passed by here often at this time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrace looked at her quickly. \xe2\x80\x9cThen did you know I was here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you tell anybody?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I knew you lived in the hut, that he had gied it up to ye, and\r\nlodged out himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you know where he lodged?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. That I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find out. Was it at Delborough?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. It was not there, Marty. Would it had been! It would have\r\nsaved\xe2\x80\x94saved\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d To check her tears she turned, and seeing a book on the\r\nwindow-bench, took it up. \xe2\x80\x9cLook, Marty, this is a Psalter. He was not\r\nan outwardly religious man, but he was pure and perfect in his heart.\r\nShall we read a psalm over him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes\xe2\x80\x94we will\xe2\x80\x94with all my heart!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrace opened the thin brown book, which poor Giles had kept at hand\r\nmainly for the convenience of whetting his pen-knife upon its leather\r\ncovers. She began to read in that rich, devotional voice peculiar to\r\nwomen only on such occasions. When it was over, Marty said, \xe2\x80\x9cI should\r\nlike to pray for his soul.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo should I,\xe2\x80\x9d said her companion. \xe2\x80\x9cBut we must not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy? Nobody would know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrace could not resist the argument, influenced as she was by the sense\r\nof making amends for having neglected him in the body; and their tender\r\nvoices united and filled the narrow room with supplicatory murmurs that\r\na Calvinist might have envied. They had hardly ended when now and more\r\nnumerous foot-falls were audible, also persons in conversation, one of\r\nwhom Grace recognized as her father.\r\n\r\nShe rose, and went to the outer apartment, in which there was only such\r\nlight as beamed from the inner one. Melbury and Mrs. Melbury were\r\nstanding there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t reproach you, Grace,\xe2\x80\x9d said her father, with an estranged\r\nmanner, and in a voice not at all like his old voice. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat has come\r\nupon you and us is beyond reproach, beyond weeping, and beyond wailing.\r\nPerhaps I drove you to it. But I am hurt; I am scourged; I am\r\nastonished. In the face of this there is nothing to be said.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout replying, Grace turned and glided back to the inner chamber.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarty,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, quickly, \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot look my father in the face until\r\nhe knows the true circumstances of my life here. Go and tell him\xe2\x80\x94what\r\nyou have told me\xe2\x80\x94what you saw\xe2\x80\x94that he gave up his house to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe sat down, her face buried in her hands, and Marty went, and after a\r\nshort absence returned. Then Grace rose, and going out asked her father\r\nif he had met her husband.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Melbury.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you know all that has happened?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do. Forgive me, Grace, for suspecting ye of worse than rashness\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nought to know ye better. Are you coming with me to what was once your\r\nhome?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I stay here with HIM. Take no account of me any more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe unwonted, perplexing, agitating relations in which she had stood to\r\nWinterborne quite lately\xe2\x80\x94brought about by Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s own\r\ncontrivance\xe2\x80\x94could not fail to soften the natural anger of a parent at\r\nher more recent doings. \xe2\x80\x9cMy daughter, things are bad,\xe2\x80\x9d he rejoined.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why do you persevere to make \xe2\x80\x99em worse? What good can you do to\r\nGiles by staying here with him? Mind, I ask no questions. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ninquire why you decided to come here, or anything as to what your\r\ncourse would have been if he had not died, though I know there\xe2\x80\x99s no\r\ndeliberate harm in ye. As for me, I have lost all claim upon you, and I\r\nmake no complaint. But I do say that by coming back with me now you\r\nwill show no less kindness to him, and escape any sound of shame.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to escape it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you don\xe2\x80\x99t on your own account, cannot you wish to on mine and hers?\r\nNobody except our household knows that you have left home. Then why\r\nshould you, by a piece of perverseness, bring down my gray hairs with\r\nsorrow to the grave?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it were not for my husband\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d she began, moved by his words. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\nhow can I meet him there? How can any woman who is not a mere man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncreature join him after what has taken place?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe would go away again rather than keep you out of my house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know that, father?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe met him on our way here, and he told us so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Melbury. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\r\nhad said something like it before. He seems very much upset\r\naltogether.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe declared to her when he came to our house that he would wait for\r\ntime and devotion to bring about his forgiveness,\xe2\x80\x9d said her husband.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was it, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it, Lucy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. That he would not intrude upon you, Grace, till you gave him\r\nabsolute permission,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Melbury added.\r\n\r\nThis antecedent considerateness in Fitzpiers was as welcome to Grace as\r\nit was unexpected; and though she did not desire his presence, she was\r\nsorry that by her retaliatory fiction she had given him a different\r\nreason for avoiding her. She made no further objections to accompanying\r\nher parents, taking them into the inner room to give Winterborne a last\r\nlook, and gathering up the two or three things that belonged to her.\r\nWhile she was doing this the two women came who had been called by\r\nMelbury, and at their heels poor Creedle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForgive me, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t rule my mourning nohow as a man should, Mr.\r\nMelbury,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI ha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t seen him since Thursday se\xe2\x80\x99night, and have\r\nwondered for days and days where he\xe2\x80\x99s been keeping. There was I\r\nexpecting him to come and tell me to wash out the cider-barrels against\r\nthe making, and here was he\xe2\x80\x94 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ve knowed him from table-high; I\r\nknowed his father\xe2\x80\x94used to bide about upon two sticks in the sun afore\r\nhe died!\xe2\x80\x94and now I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the end of the family, which we can ill\r\nafford to lose, wi\xe2\x80\x99 such a scanty lot of good folk in Hintock as we\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ngot. And now Robert Creedle will be nailed up in parish boards \xe2\x80\x99a\r\nb\xe2\x80\x99lieve; and noboby will glutch down a sigh for he!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey started for home, Marty and Creedle remaining behind. For a time\r\nGrace and her father walked side by side without speaking. It was just\r\nin the blue of the dawn, and the chilling tone of the sky was reflected\r\nin her cold, wet face. The whole wood seemed to be a house of death,\r\npervaded by loss to its uttermost length and breadth. Winterborne was\r\ngone, and the copses seemed to show the want of him; those young trees,\r\nso many of which he had planted, and of which he had spoken so truly\r\nwhen he said that he should fall before they fell, were at that very\r\nmoment sending out their roots in the direction that he had given them\r\nwith his subtle hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne thing made it tolerable to us that your husband should come back\r\nto the house,\xe2\x80\x9d said Melbury at last\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthe death of Mrs. Charmond.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Grace, arousing slightly to the recollection, \xe2\x80\x9che told\r\nme so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid he tell you how she died? It was no such death as Giles\xe2\x80\x99s. She was\r\nshot\xe2\x80\x94by a disappointed lover. It occurred in Germany. The unfortunate\r\nman shot himself afterwards. He was that South Carolina gentleman of\r\nvery passionate nature who used to haunt this place to force her to an\r\ninterview, and followed her about everywhere. So ends the brilliant\r\nFelice Charmond\xe2\x80\x94once a good friend to me\xe2\x80\x94but no friend to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can forgive her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Grace, absently. \xe2\x80\x9cDid Edgar tell you of\r\nthis?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; but he put a London newspaper, giving an account of it, on the\r\nhall table, folded in such a way that we should see it. It will be in\r\nthe Sherton paper this week, no doubt. To make the event more solemn\r\nstill to him, he had just before had sharp words with her, and left\r\nher. He told Lucy this, as nothing about him appears in the newspaper.\r\nAnd the cause of the quarrel was, of all people, she we\xe2\x80\x99ve left behind\r\nus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean Marty?\xe2\x80\x9d Grace spoke the words but perfunctorily. For,\r\npertinent and pointed as Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s story was, she had no heart for it\r\nnow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Marty South.\xe2\x80\x9d Melbury persisted in his narrative, to divert her\r\nfrom her present grief, if possible. \xe2\x80\x9cBefore he went away she wrote him\r\na letter, which he kept in his, pocket a long while before reading. He\r\nchanced to pull it out in Mrs. Charmond\xe2\x80\x99s, presence, and read it out\r\nloud. It contained something which teased her very much, and that led\r\nto the rupture. She was following him to make it up when she met with\r\nher terrible death.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMelbury did not know enough to give the gist of the incident, which was\r\nthat Marty South\xe2\x80\x99s letter had been concerning a certain personal\r\nadornment common to herself and Mrs. Charmond. Her bullet reached its\r\nbillet at last. The scene between Fitzpiers and Felice had been sharp,\r\nas only a scene can be which arises out of the mortification of one\r\nwoman by another in the presence of a lover. True, Marty had not\r\neffected it by word of mouth; the charge about the locks of hair was\r\nmade simply by Fitzpiers reading her letter to him aloud to Felice in\r\nthe playfully ironical tones of one who had become a little weary of\r\nhis situation, and was finding his friend, in the phrase of George\r\nHerbert, a \xe2\x80\x9cflat delight.\xe2\x80\x9d He had stroked those false tresses with his\r\nhand many a time without knowing them to be transplanted, and it was\r\nimpossible when the discovery was so abruptly made to avoid being\r\nfinely satirical, despite her generous disposition.\r\n\r\nThat was how it had begun, and tragedy had been its end. On his abrupt\r\ndeparture she had followed him to the station but the train was gone;\r\nand in travelling to Baden in search of him she had met his rival,\r\nwhose reproaches led to an altercation, and the death of both. Of that\r\nprecipitate scene of passion and crime Fitzpiers had known nothing till\r\nhe saw an account of it in the papers, where, fortunately for himself,\r\nno mention was made of his prior acquaintance with the unhappy lady;\r\nnor was there any allusion to him in the subsequent inquiry, the double\r\ndeath being attributed to some gambling losses, though, in point of\r\nfact, neither one of them had visited the tables.\r\n\r\nMelbury and his daughter drew near their house, having seen but one\r\nliving thing on their way, a squirrel, which did not run up its tree,\r\nbut, dropping the sweet chestnut which it carried, cried\r\nchut-chut-chut, and stamped with its hind legs on the ground. When the\r\nroofs and chimneys of the homestead began to emerge from the screen of\r\nboughs, Grace started, and checked herself in her abstracted advance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou clearly understand,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to her step-mother some of her old\r\nmisgiving returning, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I am coming back only on condition of his\r\nleaving as he promised? Will you let him know this, that there may be\r\nno mistake?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Melbury, who had some long private talks with Fitzpiers, assured\r\nGrace that she need have no doubts on that point, and that he would\r\nprobably be gone by the evening. Grace then entered with them into\r\nMelbury\xe2\x80\x99s wing of the house, and sat down listlessly in the parlor,\r\nwhile her step-mother went to Fitzpiers.\r\n\r\nThe prompt obedience to her wishes which the surgeon showed did honor\r\nto him, if anything could. Before Mrs. Melbury had returned to the room\r\nGrace, who was sitting on the parlor window-bench, saw her husband go\r\nfrom the door under the increasing light of morning, with a bag in his\r\nhand. While passing through the gate he turned his head. The firelight\r\nof the room she sat in threw her figure into dark relief against the\r\nwindow as she looked through the panes, and he must have seen her\r\ndistinctly. In a moment he went on, the gate fell to, and he\r\ndisappeared. At the hut she had declared that another had displaced\r\nhim; and now she had banished him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nFitzpiers had hardly been gone an hour when Grace began to sicken. The\r\nnext day she kept her room. Old Jones was called in; he murmured some\r\nstatements in which the words \xe2\x80\x9cfeverish symptoms\xe2\x80\x9d occurred. Grace heard\r\nthem, and guessed the means by which she had brought this visitation\r\nupon herself.\r\n\r\nOne day, while she still lay there with her head throbbing, wondering\r\nif she were really going to join him who had gone before, Grammer\r\nOliver came to her bedside. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know whe\xe2\x80\x99r this is meant for you\r\nto take, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I have found it on the table. It was\r\nleft by Marty, I think, when she came this morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrace turned her hot eyes upon what Grammer held up. It was the phial\r\nleft at the hut by her husband when he had begged her to take some\r\ndrops of its contents if she wished to preserve herself from falling a\r\nvictim to the malady which had pulled down Winterborne. She examined it\r\nas well as she could. The liquid was of an opaline hue, and bore a\r\nlabel with an inscription in Italian. He had probably got it in his\r\nwanderings abroad. She knew but little Italian, but could understand\r\nthat the cordial was a febrifuge of some sort. Her father, her mother,\r\nand all the household were anxious for her recovery, and she resolved\r\nto obey her husband\xe2\x80\x99s directions. Whatever the risk, if any, she was\r\nprepared to run it. A glass of water was brought, and the drops dropped\r\nin.\r\n\r\nThe effect, though not miraculous, was remarkable. In less than an hour\r\nshe felt calmer, cooler, better able to reflect\xe2\x80\x94less inclined to fret\r\nand chafe and wear herself away. She took a few drops more. From that\r\ntime the fever retreated, and went out like a damped conflagration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow clever he is!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, regretfully. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy could he not have had\r\nmore principle, so as to turn his great talents to good account?\r\nPerhaps he has saved my useless life. But he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know it, and\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t care whether he has saved it or not; and on that account will\r\nnever be told by me! Probably he only gave it to me in the arrogance of\r\nhis skill, to show the greatness of his resources beside mine, as\r\nElijah drew down fire from heaven.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs soon as she had quite recovered from this foiled attack upon her\r\nlife, Grace went to Marty South\xe2\x80\x99s cottage. The current of her being had\r\nagain set towards the lost Giles Winterborne.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarty,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cwe both loved him. We will go to his grave\r\ntogether.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGreat Hintock church stood at the upper part of the village, and could\r\nbe reached without passing through the street. In the dusk of the late\r\nSeptember day they went thither by secret ways, walking mostly in\r\nsilence side by side, each busied with her own thoughts. Grace had a\r\ntrouble exceeding Marty\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94that haunting sense of having put out the\r\nlight of his life by her own hasty doings. She had tried to persuade\r\nherself that he might have died of his illness, even if she had not\r\ntaken possession of his house. Sometimes she succeeded in her attempt;\r\nsometimes she did not.\r\n\r\nThey stood by the grave together, and though the sun had gone down,\r\nthey could see over the woodland for miles, and down to the vale in\r\nwhich he had been accustomed to descend every year, with his portable\r\nmill and press, to make cider about this time.\r\n\r\nPerhaps Grace\xe2\x80\x99s first grief, the discovery that if he had lived he\r\ncould never have claimed her, had some power in softening this, the\r\nsecond. On Marty\xe2\x80\x99s part there was the same consideration; never would\r\nshe have been his. As no anticipation of gratified affection had been\r\nin existence while he was with them, there was none to be disappointed\r\nnow that he had gone.\r\n\r\nGrace was abased when, by degrees, she found that she had never\r\nunderstood Giles as Marty had done. Marty South alone, of all the women\r\nin Hintock and the world, had approximated to Winterborne\xe2\x80\x99s level of\r\nintelligent intercourse with nature. In that respect she had formed the\r\ncomplement to him in the other sex, had lived as his counterpart, had\r\nsubjoined her thought to his as a corollary.\r\n\r\nThe casual glimpses which the ordinary population bestowed upon that\r\nwondrous world of sap and leaves called the Hintock woods had been with\r\nthese two, Giles and Marty, a clear gaze. They had been possessed of\r\nits finer mysteries as of commonplace knowledge; had been able to read\r\nits hieroglyphs as ordinary writing; to them the sights and sounds of\r\nnight, winter, wind, storm, amid those dense boughs, which had to Grace\r\na touch of the uncanny, and even the supernatural, were simple\r\noccurrences whose origin, continuance, and laws they foreknew. They had\r\nplanted together, and together they had felled; together they had, with\r\nthe run of the years, mentally collected those remoter signs and\r\nsymbols which, seen in few, were of runic obscurity, but all together\r\nmade an alphabet. From the light lashing of the twigs upon their faces,\r\nwhen brushing through them in the dark, they could pronounce upon the\r\nspecies of the tree whence they stretched; from the quality of the\r\nwind\xe2\x80\x99s murmur through a bough they could in like manner name its sort\r\nafar off. They knew by a glance at a trunk if its heart were sound, or\r\ntainted with incipient decay, and by the state of its upper twigs, the\r\nstratum that had been reached by its roots. The artifices of the\r\nseasons were seen by them from the conjuror\xe2\x80\x99s own point of view, and\r\nnot from that of the spectator\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe ought to have married _you_, Marty, and nobody else in the world!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Grace, with conviction, after thinking somewhat in the above\r\nstrain.\r\n\r\nMarty shook her head. \xe2\x80\x9cIn all our out-door days and years together,\r\nma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, \xe2\x80\x9cthe one thing he never spoke of to me was love;\r\nnor I to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet you and he could speak in a tongue that nobody else knew\xe2\x80\x94not even\r\nmy father, though he came nearest knowing\xe2\x80\x94the tongue of the trees and\r\nfruits and flowers themselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe could indulge in mournful fancies like this to Marty; but the hard\r\ncore to her grief\xe2\x80\x94which Marty\xe2\x80\x99s had not\xe2\x80\x94remained. Had she been sure\r\nthat Giles\xe2\x80\x99s death resulted entirely from his exposure, it would have\r\ndriven her well-nigh to insanity; but there was always that bare\r\npossibility that his exposure had only precipitated what was\r\ninevitable. She longed to believe that it had not done even this.\r\n\r\nThere was only one man whose opinion on the circumstances she would be\r\nat all disposed to trust. Her husband was that man. Yet to ask him it\r\nwould be necessary to detail the true conditions in which she and\r\nWinterborne had lived during these three or four critical days that\r\nfollowed her flight; and in withdrawing her original defiant\r\nannouncement on that point, there seemed a weakness she did not care to\r\nshow. She never doubted that Fitzpiers would believe her if she made a\r\nclean confession of the actual situation; but to volunteer the\r\ncorrection would seem like signalling for a truce, and that, in her\r\npresent frame of mind, was what she did not feel the need of.\r\n\r\nIt will probably not appear a surprising statement, after what has been\r\nalready declared of Fitzpiers, that the man whom Grace\xe2\x80\x99s fidelity could\r\nnot keep faithful was stung into passionate throbs of interest\r\nconcerning her by her avowal of the contrary.\r\n\r\nHe declared to himself that he had never known her dangerously full\r\ncompass if she were capable of such a reprisal; and, melancholy as it\r\nmay be to admit the fact, his own humiliation and regret engendered a\r\nsmouldering admiration of her.\r\n\r\nHe passed a month or two of great misery at Exbury, the place to which\r\nhe had retired\xe2\x80\x94quite as much misery indeed as Grace, could she have\r\nknown of it, would have been inclined to inflict upon any living\r\ncreature, how much soever he might have wronged her. Then a sudden hope\r\ndawned upon him; he wondered if her affirmation were true. He asked\r\nhimself whether it were not the act of a woman whose natural purity and\r\ninnocence had blinded her to the contingencies of such an announcement.\r\nHis wide experience of the sex had taught him that, in many cases,\r\nwomen who ventured on hazardous matters did so because they lacked an\r\nimagination sensuous enough to feel their full force. In this light\r\nGrace\xe2\x80\x99s bold avowal might merely have denoted the desperation of one\r\nwho was a child to the realities of obliquity.\r\n\r\nFitzpiers\xe2\x80\x99s mental sufferings and suspense led him at last to take a\r\nmelancholy journey to the neighborhood of Little Hintock; and here he\r\nhovered for hours around the scene of the purest emotional experiences\r\nthat he had ever known in his life. He walked about the woods that\r\nsurrounded Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s house, keeping out of sight like a criminal. It\r\nwas a fine evening, and on his way homeward he passed near Marty\r\nSouth\xe2\x80\x99s cottage. As usual she had lighted her candle without closing\r\nher shutters; he saw her within as he had seen her many times before.\r\n\r\nShe was polishing tools, and though he had not wished to show himself,\r\nhe could not resist speaking in to her through the half-open door.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing that for, Marty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I want to clean them. They are not mine.\xe2\x80\x9d He could see,\r\nindeed, that they were not hers, for one was a spade, large and heavy,\r\nand another was a bill-hook which she could only have used with both\r\nhands. The spade, though not a new one, had been so completely\r\nburnished that it was bright as silver.\r\n\r\nFitzpiers somehow divined that they were Giles Winterborne\xe2\x80\x99s, and he\r\nput the question to her.\r\n\r\nShe replied in the affirmative. \xe2\x80\x9cI am going to keep \xe2\x80\x99em,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut I can\xe2\x80\x99t get his apple-mill and press. I wish could; it is going to\r\nbe sold, they say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I will buy it for you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fitzpiers. \xe2\x80\x9cThat will be making you\r\na return for a kindness you did me.\xe2\x80\x9d His glance fell upon the girl\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrare-colored hair, which had grown again. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Marty, those locks of\r\nyours\xe2\x80\x94and that letter! But it was a kindness to send it, nevertheless,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe added, musingly.\r\n\r\nAfter this there was confidence between them\xe2\x80\x94such confidence as there\r\nhad never been before. Marty was shy, indeed, of speaking about the\r\nletter, and her motives in writing it; but she thanked him warmly for\r\nhis promise of the cider-press. She would travel with it in the autumn\r\nseason, as he had done, she said. She would be quite strong enough,\r\nwith old Creedle as an assistant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! there was one nearer to him than you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fitzpiers, referring\r\nto Winterborne. \xe2\x80\x9cOne who lived where he lived, and was with him when he\r\ndied.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen Marty, suspecting that he did not know the true circumstances,\r\nfrom the fact that Mrs. Fitzpiers and himself were living apart, told\r\nhim of Giles\xe2\x80\x99s generosity to Grace in giving up his house to her at the\r\nrisk, and possibly the sacrifice, of his own life. When the surgeon\r\nheard it he almost envied Giles his chivalrous character. He expressed\r\na wish to Marty that his visit to her should be kept secret, and went\r\nhome thoughtful, feeling that in more that one sense his journey to\r\nHintock had not been in vain.\r\n\r\nHe would have given much to win Grace\xe2\x80\x99s forgiveness then. But whatever\r\nhe dared hope for in that kind from the future, there was nothing to be\r\ndone yet, while Giles Winterborne\xe2\x80\x99s memory was green. To wait was\r\nimperative. A little time might melt her frozen thoughts, and lead her\r\nto look on him with toleration, if not with love.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV.\r\n\r\n\r\nWeeks and months of mourning for Winterborne had been passed by Grace\r\nin the soothing monotony of the memorial act to which she and Marty had\r\ndevoted themselves. Twice a week the pair went in the dusk to Great\r\nHintock, and, like the two mourners in _Cymbeline_, sweetened his sad\r\ngrave with their flowers and their tears. Sometimes Grace thought that\r\nit was a pity neither one of them had been his wife for a little while,\r\nand given the world a copy of him who was so valuable in their eyes.\r\nNothing ever had brought home to her with such force as this death how\r\nlittle acquirements and culture weigh beside sterling personal\r\ncharacter. While her simple sorrow for his loss took a softer edge with\r\nthe lapse of the autumn and winter seasons, her self-reproach at having\r\nhad a possible hand in causing it knew little abatement.\r\n\r\nLittle occurred at Hintock during these months of the fall and decay of\r\nthe leaf. Discussion of the almost contemporaneous death of Mrs.\r\nCharmond abroad had waxed and waned. Fitzpiers had had a marvellous\r\nescape from being dragged into the inquiry which followed it, through\r\nthe accident of their having parted just before under the influence of\r\nMarty South\xe2\x80\x99s letter\xe2\x80\x94the tiny instrument of a cause deep in nature.\r\n\r\nHer body was not brought home. It seemed to accord well with the fitful\r\nfever of that impassioned woman\xe2\x80\x99s life that she should not have found a\r\nnative grave. She had enjoyed but a life-interest in the estate, which,\r\nafter her death, passed to a relative of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94one who knew not\r\nFelice, one whose purpose seemed to be to blot out every vestige of\r\nher.\r\n\r\nOn a certain day in February\xe2\x80\x94the cheerful day of St. Valentine, in\r\nfact\xe2\x80\x94a letter reached Mrs. Fitzpiers, which had been mentally promised\r\nher for that particular day a long time before.\r\n\r\nIt announced that Fitzpiers was living at some midland town, where he\r\nhad obtained a temporary practice as assistant to some local medical\r\nman, whose curative principles were all wrong, though he dared not set\r\nthem right. He had thought fit to communicate with her on that day of\r\ntender traditions to inquire if, in the event of his obtaining a\r\nsubstantial practice that he had in view elsewhere, she could forget\r\nthe past and bring herself to join him.\r\n\r\nThere the practical part ended; he then went on\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy last year of experience has added ten years to my age, dear Grace\r\nand dearest wife that ever erring man undervalued. You may be\r\nabsolutely indifferent to what I say, but let me say it: I have never\r\nloved any woman alive or dead as I love, respect, and honor you at this\r\npresent moment. What you told me in the pride and haughtiness of your\r\nheart I never believed [this, by the way, was not strictly true]; but\r\neven if I had believed it, it could never have estranged me from you.\r\nIs there any use in telling you\xe2\x80\x94no, there is not\xe2\x80\x94that I dream of your\r\nripe lips more frequently than I say my prayers; that the old familiar\r\nrustle of your dress often returns upon my mind till it distracts me?\r\nIf you could condescend even only to see me again you would be\r\nbreathing life into a corpse. My pure, pure Grace, modest as a\r\nturtledove, how came I ever to possess you? For the sake of being\r\npresent in your mind on this lovers\xe2\x80\x99 day, I think I would almost rather\r\nhave you hate me a little than not think of me at all. You may call my\r\nfancies whimsical; but remember, sweet, lost one, that \xe2\x80\x98nature is one\r\nin love, and where \xe2\x80\x99tis fine it sends some instance of itself.\xe2\x80\x99 I will\r\nnot intrude upon you further now. Make me a little bit happy by sending\r\nback one line to say that you will consent, at any rate, to a short\r\ninterview. I will meet you and leave you as a mere acquaintance, if you\r\nwill only afford me this slight means of making a few explanations, and\r\nof putting my position before you. Believe me, in spite of all you may\r\ndo or feel,\r\n\r\n\r\nYour lover always (once your husband),\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cE.F.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was, oddly enough, the first occasion, or nearly the first on which\r\nGrace had ever received a love-letter from him, his courtship having\r\ntaken place under conditions which rendered letter-writing unnecessary.\r\nIts perusal, therefore, had a certain novelty for her. She thought\r\nthat, upon the whole, he wrote love-letters very well. But the chief\r\nrational interest of the letter to the reflective Grace lay in the\r\nchance that such a meeting as he proposed would afford her of setting\r\nher doubts at rest, one way or the other, on her actual share in\r\nWinterborne\xe2\x80\x99s death. The relief of consulting a skilled mind, the one\r\nprofessional man who had seen Giles at that time, would be immense. As\r\nfor that statement that she had uttered in her disdainful grief, which\r\nat the time she had regarded as her triumph, she was quite prepared to\r\nadmit to him that his belief was the true one; for in wronging herself\r\nas she did when she made it, she had done what to her was a far more\r\nserious thing, wronged Winterborne\xe2\x80\x99s memory.\r\n\r\nWithout consulting her father, or any one in the house or out of it,\r\nGrace replied to the letter. She agreed to meet Fitzpiers on two\r\nconditions, of which the first was that the place of meeting should be\r\nthe top of Rubdown Hill, the second that he would not object to Marty\r\nSouth accompanying her.\r\n\r\nWhatever part, much or little, there may have been in Fitzpiers\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nso-called valentine to his wife, he felt a delight as of the bursting\r\nof spring when her brief reply came. It was one of the few pleasures\r\nthat he had experienced of late years at all resembling those of his\r\nearly youth. He promptly replied that he accepted the conditions, and\r\nnamed the day and hour at which he would be on the spot she mentioned.\r\n\r\nA few minutes before three on the appointed day found him climbing the\r\nwell-known hill, which had been the axis of so many critical movements\r\nin their lives during his residence at Hintock.\r\n\r\nThe sight of each homely and well-remembered object swelled the regret\r\nthat seldom left him now. Whatever paths might lie open to his future,\r\nthe soothing shades of Hintock were forbidden him forever as a\r\npermanent dwelling-place.\r\n\r\nHe longed for the society of Grace. But to lay offerings on her\r\nslighted altar was his first aim, and until her propitiation was\r\ncomplete he would constrain her in no way to return to him. The least\r\nreparation that he could make, in a case where he would gladly have\r\nmade much, would be to let her feel herself absolutely free to choose\r\nbetween living with him and without him.\r\n\r\nMoreover, a subtlist in emotions, he cultivated as under glasses\r\nstrange and mournful pleasures that he would not willingly let die just\r\nat present. To show any forwardness in suggesting a _modus vivendi_ to\r\nGrace would be to put an end to these exotics. To be the vassal of her\r\nsweet will for a time, he demanded no more, and found solace in the\r\ncontemplation of the soft miseries she caused him.\r\n\r\nApproaching the hill-top with a mind strung to these notions, Fitzpiers\r\ndiscerned a gay procession of people coming over the crest, and was not\r\nlong in perceiving it to be a wedding-party.\r\n\r\nThough the wind was keen the women were in light attire, and the\r\nflowered waistcoats of the men had a pleasing vividness of pattern.\r\nEach of the gentler ones clung to the arm of her partner so tightly as\r\nto have with him one step, rise, swing, gait, almost one centre of\r\ngravity. In the buxom bride Fitzpiers recognized no other than Suke\r\nDamson, who in her light gown looked a giantess; the small husband\r\nbeside her he saw to be Tim Tangs.\r\n\r\nFitzpiers could not escape, for they had seen him; though of all the\r\nbeauties of the world whom he did not wish to meet Suke was the chief.\r\nBut he put the best face on the matter that he could and came on, the\r\napproaching company evidently discussing him and his separation from\r\nMrs. Fitzpiers. As the couples closed upon him he expressed his\r\ncongratulations.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe be just walking round the parishes to show ourselves a bit,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nTim. \xe2\x80\x9cFirst we het across to Delborough, then athwart to here, and from\r\nhere we go to Rubdown and Millshot, and then round by the cross-roads\r\nhome. Home says I, but it won\xe2\x80\x99t be that long! We be off next month.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed. Where to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTim informed him that they were going to New Zealand. Not but that he\r\nwould have been contented with Hintock, but his wife was ambitious and\r\nwanted to leave, so he had given way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen good-by,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fitzpiers; \xe2\x80\x9cI may not see you again.\xe2\x80\x9d He shook\r\nhands with Tim and turned to the bride. \xe2\x80\x9cGood-by, Suke,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\ntaking her hand also. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish you and your husband prosperity in the\r\ncountry you have chosen.\xe2\x80\x9d With this he left them, and hastened on to\r\nhis appointment.\r\n\r\nThe wedding-party re-formed and resumed march likewise. But in\r\nrestoring his arm to Suke, Tim noticed that her full and blooming\r\ncountenance had undergone a change. \xe2\x80\x9cHolloa! me dear\xe2\x80\x94what\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nmatter?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing to speak o\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d said she. But to give the lie to her assertion\r\nshe was seized with lachrymose twitches, that soon produced a dribbling\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x94what the devil\xe2\x80\x99s this about!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the bridegroom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s a little wee bit overcome, poor dear!\xe2\x80\x9d said the first\r\nbridesmaid, unfolding her handkerchief and wiping Suke\xe2\x80\x99s eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never did like parting from people!\xe2\x80\x9d said Suke, as soon as she could\r\nspeak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy him in particular?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s such a clever doctor, that \xe2\x80\x99tis a thousand pities we sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsee him any more! There\xe2\x80\x99ll be no such clever doctor as he in New\r\nZealand, if I should require one; and the thought o\xe2\x80\x99t got the better of\r\nmy feelings!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey walked on, but Tim\xe2\x80\x99s face had grown rigid and pale, for he\r\nrecalled slight circumstances, disregarded at the time of their\r\noccurrence. The former boisterous laughter of the wedding-party at the\r\ngroomsman\xe2\x80\x99s jokes was heard ringing through the woods no more.\r\n\r\nBy this time Fitzpiers had advanced on his way to the top of the hill,\r\nwhere he saw two figures emerging from the bank on the right hand.\r\nThese were the expected ones, Grace and Marty South, who had evidently\r\ncome there by a short and secret path through the wood. Grace was\r\nmuffled up in her winter dress, and he thought that she had never\r\nlooked so seductive as at this moment, in the noontide bright but\r\nheatless sun, and the keen wind, and the purplish-gray masses of\r\nbrushwood around.\r\n\r\nFitzpiers continued to regard the nearing picture, till at length their\r\nglances met for a moment, when she demurely sent off hers at a tangent\r\nand gave him the benefit of her three-quarter face, while with\r\ncourteous completeness of conduct he lifted his hat in a large arc.\r\nMarty dropped behind; and when Fitzpiers held out his hand, Grace\r\ntouched it with her fingers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have agreed to be here mostly because I wanted to ask you something\r\nimportant,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Fitzpiers, her intonation modulating in a\r\ndirection that she had not quite wished it to take.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am most attentive,\xe2\x80\x9d said her husband. \xe2\x80\x9cShall we take to the wood for\r\nprivacy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrace demurred, and Fitzpiers gave in, and they kept the public road.\r\n\r\nAt any rate she would take his arm? This also was gravely negatived,\r\nthe refusal being audible to Marty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d he inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Mr. Fitzpiers\xe2\x80\x94how can you ask?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRight, right,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, his effusiveness shrivelled up.\r\n\r\nAs they walked on she returned to her inquiry. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is about a matter\r\nthat may perhaps be unpleasant to you. But I think I need not consider\r\nthat too carefully.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fitzpiers, heroically.\r\n\r\nShe then took him back to the time of poor Winterborne\xe2\x80\x99s death, and\r\nrelated the precise circumstances amid which his fatal illness had come\r\nupon him, particularizing the dampness of the shelter to which he had\r\nbetaken himself, his concealment from her of the hardships that he was\r\nundergoing, all that he had put up with, all that he had done for her\r\nin his scrupulous considerateness. The retrospect brought her to tears\r\nas she asked him if he thought that the sin of having driven him to his\r\ndeath was upon her.\r\n\r\nFitzpiers could hardly help showing his satisfaction at what her\r\nnarrative indirectly revealed, the actual harmlessness of an escapade\r\nwith her lover, which had at first, by her own showing, looked so\r\ngrave, and he did not care to inquire whether that harmlessness had\r\nbeen the result of aim or of accident. With regard to her question, he\r\ndeclared that in his judgment no human being could answer it. He\r\nthought that upon the whole the balance of probabilities turned in her\r\nfavor. Winterborne\xe2\x80\x99s apparent strength, during the last months of his\r\nlife, must have been delusive. It had often occurred that after a first\r\nattack of that insidious disease a person\xe2\x80\x99s apparent recovery was a\r\nphysiological mendacity.\r\n\r\nThe relief which came to Grace lay almost as much in sharing her\r\nknowledge of the particulars with an intelligent mind as in the\r\nassurances Fitzpiers gave her. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, to put this case before\r\nyou, and obtain your professional opinion, was chiefly why I consented\r\nto come here to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, when he had reached the aforesaid\r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor no other reason at all?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, ruefully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was nearly the whole.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey stood and looked over a gate at twenty or thirty starlings feeding\r\nin the grass, and he started the talk again by saying, in a low voice,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet I love you more than ever I loved you in my life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrace did not move her eyes from the birds, and folded her delicate\r\nlips as if to keep them in subjection.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a different kind of love altogether,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cLess passionate;\r\nmore profound. It has nothing to do with the material conditions of the\r\nobject at all; much to do with her character and goodness, as revealed\r\nby closer observation. \xe2\x80\x98Love talks with better knowledge, and knowledge\r\nwith dearer love.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s out of _Measure for Measure_,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, slyly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes\xe2\x80\x94I meant it as a citation,\xe2\x80\x9d blandly replied Fitzpiers. \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\r\nthen, why not give me a very little bit of your heart again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe crash of a felled tree in the remote depths of the wood recalled\r\nthe past at that moment, and all the homely faithfulness of\r\nWinterborne. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t ask it! My heart is in the grave with Giles,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nreplied, stanchly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMine is with you\xe2\x80\x94in no less deep a grave, I fear, according to that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very sorry; but it cannot be helped.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can you be sorry for me, when you wilfully keep open the grave?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s not so,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Grace, quickly, and moved to go away\r\nfrom him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, dearest Grace,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have condescended to come; and I\r\nthought from it that perhaps when I had passed through a long state of\r\nprobation you would be generous. But if there can be no hope of our\r\ngetting completely reconciled, treat me gently\xe2\x80\x94wretch though I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not say you were a wretch, nor have I ever said so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you have such a contemptuous way of looking at me that I fear you\r\nthink so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrace\xe2\x80\x99s heart struggled between the wish not to be harsh and the fear\r\nthat she might mislead him. \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot look contemptuous unless I feel\r\ncontempt,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, evasively. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd all I feel is lovelessness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been very bad, I know,\xe2\x80\x9d he returned. \xe2\x80\x9cBut unless you can really\r\nlove me again, Grace, I would rather go away from you forever. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwant you to receive me again for duty\xe2\x80\x99s sake, or anything of that sort.\r\nIf I had not cared more for your affection and forgiveness than my own\r\npersonal comfort, I should never have come back here. I could have\r\nobtained a practice at a distance, and have lived my own life without\r\ncoldness or reproach. But I have chosen to return to the one spot on\r\nearth where my name is tarnished\xe2\x80\x94to enter the house of a man from whom\r\nI have had worse treatment than from any other man alive\xe2\x80\x94all for you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was undeniably true, and it had its weight with Grace, who began\r\nto look as if she thought she had been shockingly severe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore you go,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cI want to know your pleasure about\r\nme\xe2\x80\x94what you wish me to do, or not to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are independent of me, and it seems a mockery to ask that. Far be\r\nit from me to advise. But I will think it over. I rather need advice\r\nmyself than stand in a position to give it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_You_ don\xe2\x80\x99t need advice, wisest, dearest woman that ever lived. If you\r\ndid\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you give it to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you act upon what I gave?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s not a fair inquiry,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, smiling despite her gravity. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t mind hearing it\xe2\x80\x94what you do really think the most correct and\r\nproper course for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is so easy for me to say, and yet I dare not, for it would be\r\nprovoking you to remonstrances.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKnowing, of course, what the advice would be, she did not press him\r\nfurther, and was about to beckon Marty forward and leave him, when he\r\ninterrupted her with, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, one moment, dear Grace\xe2\x80\x94you will meet me\r\nagain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe eventually agreed to see him that day fortnight. Fitzpiers\r\nexpostulated at the interval, but the half-alarmed earnestness with\r\nwhich she entreated him not to come sooner made him say hastily that he\r\nsubmitted to her will\xe2\x80\x94that he would regard her as a friend only,\r\nanxious for his reform and well-being, till such time as she might\r\nallow him to exceed that privilege.\r\n\r\nAll this was to assure her; it was only too clear that he had not won\r\nher confidence yet. It amazed Fitzpiers, and overthrew all his\r\ndeductions from previous experience, to find that this girl, though she\r\nhad been married to him, could yet be so coy. Notwithstanding a certain\r\nfascination that it carried with it, his reflections were sombre as he\r\nwent homeward; he saw how deep had been his offence to produce so great\r\na wariness in a gentle and once unsuspicious soul.\r\n\r\nHe was himself too fastidious to care to coerce her. To be an object of\r\nmisgiving or dislike to a woman who shared his home was what he could\r\nnot endure the thought of. Life as it stood was more tolerable.\r\n\r\nWhen he was gone, Marty joined Mrs. Fitzpiers. She would fain have\r\nconsulted Marty on the question of Platonic relations with her former\r\nhusband, as she preferred to regard him. But Marty showed no great\r\ninterest in their affairs, so Grace said nothing. They came onward, and\r\nsaw Melbury standing at the scene of the felling which had been audible\r\nto them, when, telling Marty that she wished her meeting with Mr.\r\nFitzpiers to be kept private, she left the girl to join her father. At\r\nany rate, she would consult him on the expediency of occasionally\r\nseeing her husband.\r\n\r\nHer father was cheerful, and walked by her side as he had done in\r\nearlier days. \xe2\x80\x9cI was thinking of you when you came up,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nhave considered that what has happened is for the best. Since your\r\nhusband is gone away, and seems not to wish to trouble you, why, let\r\nhim go, and drop out of your life. Many women are worse off. You can\r\nlive here comfortably enough, and he can emigrate, or do what he likes\r\nfor his good. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind sending him the further sum of money he\r\nmight naturally expect to come to him, so that you may not be bothered\r\nwith him any more. He could hardly have gone on living here without\r\nspeaking to me, or meeting me; and that would have been very unpleasant\r\non both sides.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese remarks checked her intention. There was a sense of weakness in\r\nfollowing them by saying that she had just met her husband by\r\nappointment. \xe2\x80\x9cThen you would advise me not to communicate with him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe observed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall never advise ye again. You are your own mistress\xe2\x80\x94do as you\r\nlike. But my opinion is that if you don\xe2\x80\x99t live with him, you had better\r\nlive without him, and not go shilly-shallying and playing bopeep. You\r\nsent him away; and now he\xe2\x80\x99s gone. Very well; trouble him no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrace felt a guiltiness\xe2\x80\x94she hardly knew why\xe2\x80\x94and made no confession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe woods were uninteresting, and Grace stayed in-doors a great deal.\r\nShe became quite a student, reading more than she had done since her\r\nmarriage But her seclusion was always broken for the periodical visit\r\nto Winterborne\xe2\x80\x99s grave with Marty, which was kept up with pious\r\nstrictness, for the purpose of putting snow-drops, primroses, and other\r\nvernal flowers thereon as they came.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon at sunset she was standing just outside her father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngarden, which, like the rest of the Hintock enclosures, abutted into\r\nthe wood. A slight foot-path led along here, forming a secret way to\r\neither of the houses by getting through its boundary hedge. Grace was\r\njust about to adopt this mode of entry when a figure approached along\r\nthe path, and held up his hand to detain her. It was her husband.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am delighted,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, coming up out of breath; and there seemed no\r\nreason to doubt his words. \xe2\x80\x9cI saw you some way off\xe2\x80\x94I was afraid you\r\nwould go in before I could reach you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a week before the time,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, reproachfully. \xe2\x80\x9cI said a\r\nfortnight from the last meeting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear, you don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose I could wait a fortnight without trying to\r\nget a glimpse of you, even though you had declined to meet me! Would it\r\nmake you angry to know that I have been along this path at dusk three\r\nor four times since our last meeting? Well, how are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe did not refuse her hand, but when he showed a wish to retain it a\r\nmoment longer than mere formality required, she made it smaller, so\r\nthat it slipped away from him, with again that same alarmed look which\r\nalways followed his attempts in this direction. He saw that she was not\r\nyet out of the elusive mood; not yet to be treated presumingly; and he\r\nwas correspondingly careful to tranquillize her.\r\n\r\nHis assertion had seemed to impress her somewhat. \xe2\x80\x9cI had no idea you\r\ncame so often,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cHow far do you come from?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom Exbury. I always walk from Sherton-Abbas, for if I hire, people\r\nwill know that I come; and my success with you so far has not been\r\ngreat enough to justify such overtness. Now, my dear one\xe2\x80\x94as I _must_\r\ncall you\xe2\x80\x94I put it to you: will you see me a little oftener as the\r\nspring advances?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrace lapsed into unwonted sedateness, and avoiding the question, said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you would concentrate on your profession, and give up those\r\nstrange studies that used to distract you so much. I am sure you would\r\nget on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the very thing I am doing. I was going to ask you to burn\xe2\x80\x94or, at\r\nleast, get rid of\xe2\x80\x94all my philosophical literature. It is in the\r\nbookcases in your rooms. The fact is, I never cared much for abstruse\r\nstudies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am so glad to hear you say that. And those other books\xe2\x80\x94those piles\r\nof old plays\xe2\x80\x94what good are they to a medical man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone whatever!\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, cheerfully. \xe2\x80\x9cSell them at Sherton for what\r\nthey will fetch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd those dreadful old French romances, with their horrid spellings of\r\n\xe2\x80\x98filz\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98ung\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98ilz\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98mary\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98ma foy?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou haven\xe2\x80\x99t been reading them, Grace?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no\xe2\x80\x94I just looked into them, that was all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMake a bonfire of \xe2\x80\x99em directly you get home. I meant to do it myself.\r\nI can\xe2\x80\x99t think what possessed me ever to collect them. I have only a few\r\nprofessional hand-books now, and am quite a practical man. I am in\r\nhopes of having some good news to tell you soon, and then do you think\r\nyou could\xe2\x80\x94come to me again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would rather you did not press me on that just now,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied,\r\nwith some feeling. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have said you mean to lead a new, useful,\r\neffectual life; but I should like to see you put it in practice for a\r\nlittle while before you address that query to me. Besides\xe2\x80\x94I could not\r\nlive with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrace was silent a few instants. \xe2\x80\x9cI go with Marty to Giles\xe2\x80\x99s grave. We\r\nswore we would show him that devotion. And I mean to keep it up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind that at all. I have no right to expect anything\r\nelse, and I will not wish you to keep away. I liked the man as well as\r\nany I ever knew. In short, I would accompany you a part of the way to\r\nthe place, and smoke a cigar on the stile while I waited till you came\r\nback.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you haven\xe2\x80\x99t given up smoking?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94ahem\xe2\x80\x94no. I have thought of doing so, but\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis extreme complacence had rather disconcerted Grace, and the question\r\nabout smoking had been to effect a diversion. Presently she said,\r\nfirmly, and with a moisture in her eye that he could not see, as her\r\nmind returned to poor Giles\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cfrustrate ghost,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like you\xe2\x80\x94to\r\nspeak lightly on that subject, if you did speak lightly. To be frank\r\nwith you\xe2\x80\x94quite frank\xe2\x80\x94I think of him as my betrothed lover still. I\r\ncannot help it. So that it would be wrong for me to join you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFitzpiers was now uneasy. \xe2\x80\x9cYou say your betrothed lover still,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nrejoined. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen, then, were you betrothed to him, or engaged, as we\r\ncommon people say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you were away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow could that be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrace would have avoided this; but her natural candor led her on. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nwas when I was under the impression that my marriage with you was about\r\nto be annulled, and that he could then marry me. So I encouraged him to\r\nlove me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFitzpiers winced visibly; and yet, upon the whole, she was right in\r\ntelling it. Indeed, his perception that she was right in her absolute\r\nsincerity kept up his affectionate admiration for her under the pain of\r\nthe rebuff. Time had been when the avowal that Grace had deliberately\r\ntaken steps to replace him would have brought him no sorrow. But she so\r\nfar dominated him now that he could not bear to hear her words,\r\nalthough the object of her high regard was no more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is rough upon me\xe2\x80\x94that!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, bitterly. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Grace\xe2\x80\x94I did not\r\nknow you\xe2\x80\x94tried to get rid of me! I suppose it is of no use, but I ask,\r\ncannot you hope to\xe2\x80\x94find a little love in your heart for me again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I could I would oblige you; but I fear I cannot!\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, with\r\nillogical ruefulness. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I don\xe2\x80\x99t see why you should mind my having\r\nhad one lover besides yourself in my life, when you have had so many.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I can tell you honestly that I love you better than all of them\r\nput together, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what you will not tell me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry; but I fear I cannot,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, sighing again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder if you ever will?\xe2\x80\x9d He looked musingly into her indistinct\r\nface, as if he would read the future there. \xe2\x80\x9cNow have pity, and tell\r\nme: will you try?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo love you again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; if you can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to reply,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, her embarrassment proving\r\nher truth. \xe2\x80\x9cWill you promise to leave me quite free as to seeing you or\r\nnot seeing you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly. Have I given any ground for you to doubt my first promise\r\nin that respect?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was obliged to admit that he had not.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I think that you might get your heart out of that grave,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nhe, with playful sadness. \xe2\x80\x9cIt has been there a long time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe faintly shook her head, but said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll try to think of you more\xe2\x80\x94if\r\nI can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith this Fitzpiers was compelled to be satisfied, and he asked her\r\nwhen she would meet him again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs we arranged\xe2\x80\x94in a fortnight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it must be a fortnight it must!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis time at least. I\xe2\x80\x99ll consider by the day I see you again if I can\r\nshorten the interval.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, be that as it may, I shall come at least twice a week to look at\r\nyour window.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must do as you like about that. Good-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay \xe2\x80\x98husband.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe seemed almost inclined to give him the word; but exclaiming, \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\r\nno; I cannot,\xe2\x80\x9d slipped through the garden-hedge and disappeared.\r\n\r\nFitzpiers did not exaggerate when he told her that he should haunt the\r\nprecincts of the dwelling. But his persistence in this course did not\r\nresult in his seeing her much oftener than at the fortnightly interval\r\nwhich she had herself marked out as proper. At these times, however,\r\nshe punctually appeared, and as the spring wore on the meetings were\r\nkept up, though their character changed but little with the increase in\r\ntheir number.\r\n\r\nThe small garden of the cottage occupied by the Tangs family\xe2\x80\x94father,\r\nson, and now son\xe2\x80\x99s wife\xe2\x80\x94aligned with the larger one of the\r\ntimber-dealer at its upper end; and when young Tim, after leaving work\r\nat Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s, stood at dusk in the little bower at the corner of his\r\nenclosure to smoke a pipe, he frequently observed the surgeon pass\r\nalong the outside track before-mentioned. Fitzpiers always walked\r\nloiteringly, pensively, looking with a sharp eye into the gardens one\r\nafter another as he proceeded; for Fitzpiers did not wish to leave the\r\nnow absorbing spot too quickly, after travelling so far to reach it;\r\nhoping always for a glimpse of her whom he passionately desired to take\r\nto his arms anew.\r\n\r\nNow Tim began to be struck with these loitering progresses along the\r\ngarden boundaries in the gloaming, and wondered what they boded. It\r\nwas, naturally, quite out of his power to divine the singular,\r\nsentimental revival in Fitzpiers\xe2\x80\x99s heart; the fineness of tissue which\r\ncould take a deep, emotional\xe2\x80\x94almost also an artistic\xe2\x80\x94pleasure in being\r\nthe yearning _innamorato_ of a woman he once had deserted, would have\r\nseemed an absurdity to the young sawyer. Mr. and Mrs. Fitzpiers were\r\nseparated; therefore the question of affection as between them was\r\nsettled. But his Suke had, since that meeting on their marriage-day,\r\nrepentantly admitted, to the urgency of his questioning, a good deal\r\nconcerning her past levities. Putting all things together, he could\r\nhardly avoid connecting Fitzpiers\xe2\x80\x99s mysterious visits to this spot with\r\nSuke\xe2\x80\x99s residence under his roof. But he made himself fairly easy: the\r\nvessel in which they were about to emigrate sailed that month; and then\r\nSuke would be out of Fitzpiers\xe2\x80\x99s way forever.\r\n\r\nThe interval at last expired, and the eve of their departure arrived.\r\nThey were pausing in the room of the cottage allotted to them by Tim\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfather, after a busy day of preparation, which left them weary. In a\r\ncorner stood their boxes, crammed and corded, their large case for the\r\nhold having already been sent away. The firelight shone upon Suke\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfine face and form as she stood looking into it, and upon the face of\r\nTim seated in a corner, and upon the walls of his father\xe2\x80\x99s house, which\r\nhe was beholding that night almost for the last time.\r\n\r\nTim Tangs was not happy. This scheme of emigration was dividing him\r\nfrom his father\xe2\x80\x94for old Tangs would on no account leave Hintock\xe2\x80\x94and had\r\nit not been for Suke\xe2\x80\x99s reputation and his own dignity, Tim would at the\r\nlast moment have abandoned the project. As he sat in the back part of\r\nthe room he regarded her moodily, and the fire and the boxes. One thing\r\nhe had particularly noticed this evening\xe2\x80\x94she was very restless; fitful\r\nin her actions, unable to remain seated, and in a marked degree\r\ndepressed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSorry that you be going, after all, Suke?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nShe sighed involuntarily. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know but that I be,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis natural, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it, when one is going away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you wasn\xe2\x80\x99t born here as I was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s folk left behind that you\xe2\x80\x99d fain have with \xe2\x80\x99ee, I reckon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you think that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve seen things and I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard things; and, Suke, I say \xe2\x80\x99twill be a\r\ngood move for me to get \xe2\x80\x99ee away. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind his leavings abroad, but\r\nI do mind \xe2\x80\x99em at home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuke\xe2\x80\x99s face was not changed from its aspect of listless indifference by\r\nthe words. She answered nothing; and shortly after he went out for his\r\ncustomary pipe of tobacco at the top of the garden.\r\n\r\nThe restlessness of Suke had indeed owed its presence to the gentleman\r\nof Tim\xe2\x80\x99s suspicions, but in a different\xe2\x80\x94and it must be added in justice\r\nto her\xe2\x80\x94more innocent sense than he supposed, judging from former\r\ndoings. She had accidentally discovered that Fitzpiers was in the habit\r\nof coming secretly once or twice a week to Hintock, and knew that this\r\nevening was a favorite one of the seven for his journey. As she was\r\ngoing next day to leave the country, Suke thought there could be no\r\ngreat harm in giving way to a little sentimentality by obtaining a\r\nglimpse of him quite unknown to himself or to anybody, and thus taking\r\na silent last farewell. Aware that Fitzpiers\xe2\x80\x99s time for passing was at\r\nhand she thus betrayed her feeling. No sooner, therefore, had Tim left\r\nthe room than she let herself noiselessly out of the house, and\r\nhastened to the corner of the garden, whence she could witness the\r\nsurgeon\xe2\x80\x99s transit across the scene\xe2\x80\x94if he had not already gone by.\r\n\r\nHer light cotton dress was visible to Tim lounging in the arbor of the\r\nopposite corner, though he was hidden from her. He saw her stealthily\r\nclimb into the hedge, and so ensconce herself there that nobody could\r\nhave the least doubt her purpose was to watch unseen for a passer-by.\r\n\r\nHe went across to the spot and stood behind her. Suke started, having\r\nin her blundering way forgotten that he might be near. She at once\r\ndescended from the hedge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo he\xe2\x80\x99s coming to-night,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tim, laconically. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd we be always\r\nanxious to see our dears.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe _is_ coming to-night,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, with defiance. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd we _be_\r\nanxious for our dears.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen will you step in-doors, where your dear will soon jine \xe2\x80\x99ee? We\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nto mouster by half-past three to-morrow, and if we don\xe2\x80\x99t get to bed by\r\neight at latest our faces will be as long as clock-cases all day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe hesitated for a minute, but ultimately obeyed, going slowly down\r\nthe garden to the house, where he heard the door-latch click behind\r\nher.\r\n\r\nTim was incensed beyond measure. His marriage had so far been a total\r\nfailure, a source of bitter regret; and the only course for improving\r\nhis case, that of leaving the country, was a sorry, and possibly might\r\nnot be a very effectual one. Do what he would, his domestic sky was\r\nlikely to be overcast to the end of the day. Thus he brooded, and his\r\nresentment gathered force. He craved a means of striking one blow back\r\nat the cause of his cheerless plight, while he was still on the scene\r\nof his discomfiture. For some minutes no method suggested itself, and\r\nthen he had an idea.\r\n\r\nComing to a sudden resolution, he hastened along the garden, and\r\nentered the one attached to the next cottage, which had formerly been\r\nthe dwelling of a game-keeper. Tim descended the path to the back of\r\nthe house, where only an old woman lived at present, and reaching the\r\nwall he stopped. Owing to the slope of the ground the roof-eaves of the\r\nlinhay were here within touch, and he thrust his arm up under them,\r\nfeeling about in the space on the top of the wall-plate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, I thought my memory didn\xe2\x80\x99t deceive me!\xe2\x80\x9d he lipped silently.\r\n\r\nWith some exertion he drew down a cobwebbed object curiously framed in\r\niron, which clanked as he moved it. It was about three feet in length\r\nand half as wide. Tim contemplated it as well as he could in the dying\r\nlight of day, and raked off the cobwebs with his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat will spoil his pretty shins for\xe2\x80\x99n, I reckon!\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nIt was a man-trap.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nWere the inventors of automatic machines to be ranged according to the\r\nexcellence of their devices for producing sound artistic torture, the\r\ncreator of the man-trap would occupy a very respectable if not a very\r\nhigh place.\r\n\r\nIt should rather, however, be said, the inventor of the particular form\r\nof man-trap of which this found in the keeper\xe2\x80\x99s out-house was a\r\nspecimen. For there were other shapes and other sizes, instruments\r\nwhich, if placed in a row beside one of the type disinterred by Tim,\r\nwould have worn the subordinate aspect of the bears, wild boars, or\r\nwolves in a travelling menagerie, as compared with the leading lion or\r\ntiger. In short, though many varieties had been in use during those\r\ncenturies which we are accustomed to look back upon as the true and\r\nonly period of merry England\xe2\x80\x94in the rural districts more especially\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nonward down to the third decade of the nineteenth century, this model\r\nhad borne the palm, and had been most usually followed when the\r\norchards and estates required new ones.\r\n\r\nThere had been the toothless variety used by the softer-hearted\r\nlandlords\xe2\x80\x94quite contemptible in their clemency. The jaws of these\r\nresembled the jaws of an old woman to whom time has left nothing but\r\ngums. There were also the intermediate or half-toothed sorts, probably\r\ndevised by the middle-natured squires, or those under the influence of\r\ntheir wives: two inches of mercy, two inches of cruelty, two inches of\r\nmere nip, two inches of probe, and so on, through the whole extent of\r\nthe jaws. There were also, as a class apart, the bruisers, which did\r\nnot lacerate the flesh, but only crushed the bone.\r\n\r\nThe sight of one of these gins when set produced a vivid impression\r\nthat it was endowed with life. It exhibited the combined aspects of a\r\nshark, a crocodile, and a scorpion. Each tooth was in the form of a\r\ntapering spine, two and a quarter inches long, which, when the jaws\r\nwere closed, stood in alternation from this side and from that. When\r\nthey were open, the two halves formed a complete circle between two and\r\nthree feet in diameter, the plate or treading-place in the midst being\r\nabout a foot square, while from beneath extended in opposite directions\r\nthe soul of the apparatus, the pair of springs, each one being of a\r\nstiffness to render necessary a lever or the whole weight of the body\r\nwhen forcing it down.\r\n\r\nThere were men at this time still living at Hintock who remembered when\r\nthe gin and others like it were in use. Tim Tangs\xe2\x80\x99s great-uncle had\r\nendured a night of six hours in this very trap, which lamed him for\r\nlife. Once a keeper of Hintock woods set it on the track of a poacher,\r\nand afterwards, coming back that way, forgetful of what he had done,\r\nwalked into it himself. The wound brought on lockjaw, of which he died.\r\nThis event occurred during the thirties, and by the year 1840 the use\r\nof such implements was well-nigh discontinued in the neighborhood. But\r\nbeing made entirely of iron, they by no means disappeared, and in\r\nalmost every village one could be found in some nook or corner as\r\nreadily as this was found by Tim. It had, indeed, been a fearful\r\namusement of Tim and other Hintock lads\xe2\x80\x94especially those who had a dim\r\nsense of becoming renowned poachers when they reached their prime\xe2\x80\x94to\r\ndrag out this trap from its hiding, set it, and throw it with billets\r\nof wood, which were penetrated by the teeth to the depth of near an\r\ninch.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he had examined the trap, and found that the hinges and\r\nsprings were still perfect, he shouldered it without more ado, and\r\nreturned with his burden to his own garden, passing on through the\r\nhedge to the path immediately outside the boundary. Here, by the help\r\nof a stout stake, he set the trap, and laid it carefully behind a bush\r\nwhile he went forward to reconnoitre. As has been stated, nobody passed\r\nthis way for days together sometimes; but there was just a possibility\r\nthat some other pedestrian than the one in request might arrive, and it\r\nbehooved Tim to be careful as to the identity of his victim.\r\n\r\nGoing about a hundred yards along the rising ground to the right, he\r\nreached a ridge whereon a large and thick holly grew. Beyond this for\r\nsome distance the wood was more open, and the course which Fitzpiers\r\nmust pursue to reach the point, if he came to-night, was visible a long\r\nway forward.\r\n\r\nFor some time there was no sign of him or of anybody. Then there shaped\r\nitself a spot out of the dim mid-distance, between the masses of\r\nbrushwood on either hand. And it enlarged, and Tim could hear the\r\nbrushing of feet over the tufts of sour-grass. The airy gait revealed\r\nFitzpiers even before his exact outline could be seen.\r\n\r\nTim Tangs turned about, and ran down the opposite side of the hill,\r\ntill he was again at the head of his own garden. It was the work of a\r\nfew moments to drag out the man-trap, very gently\xe2\x80\x94that the plate might\r\nnot be disturbed sufficiently to throw it\xe2\x80\x94to a space between a pair of\r\nyoung oaks which, rooted in contiguity, grew apart upward, forming a\r\nV-shaped opening between; and, being backed up by bushes, left this as\r\nthe only course for a foot-passenger. In it he laid the trap with the\r\nsame gentleness of handling, locked the chain round one of the trees,\r\nand finally slid back the guard which was placed to keep the gin from\r\naccidentally catching the arms of him who set it, or, to use the local\r\nand better word, \xe2\x80\x9ctoiled\xe2\x80\x9d it.\r\n\r\nHaving completed these arrangements, Tim sprang through the adjoining\r\nhedge of his father\xe2\x80\x99s garden, ran down the path, and softly entered the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nObedient to his order, Suke had gone to bed; and as soon as he had\r\nbolted the door, Tim unlaced and kicked off his boots at the foot of\r\nthe stairs, and retired likewise, without lighting a candle. His object\r\nseemed to be to undress as soon as possible. Before, however, he had\r\ncompleted the operation, a long cry resounded without\xe2\x80\x94penetrating, but\r\nindescribable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d said Suke, starting up in bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSounds as if somebody had caught a hare in his gin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no,\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was not a hare, \xe2\x80\x99twas louder. Hark!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo \xe2\x80\x99ee get to sleep,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tim. \xe2\x80\x9cHow be you going to wake at half-past\r\nthree else?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe lay down and was silent. Tim stealthily opened the window and\r\nlistened. Above the low harmonies produced by the instrumentation of\r\nthe various species of trees around the premises he could hear the\r\ntwitching of a chain from the spot whereon he had set the man-trap. But\r\nfurther human sound there was none.\r\n\r\nTim was puzzled. In the haste of his project he had not calculated upon\r\na cry; but if one, why not more? He soon ceased to essay an answer, for\r\nHintock was dead to him already. In half a dozen hours he would be out\r\nof its precincts for life, on his way to the antipodes. He closed the\r\nwindow and lay down.\r\n\r\nThe hour which had brought these movements of Tim to birth had been\r\noperating actively elsewhere. Awaiting in her father\xe2\x80\x99s house the minute\r\nof her appointment with her husband, Grace Fitzpiers deliberated on\r\nmany things. Should she inform her father before going out that the\r\nestrangement of herself and Edgar was not so complete as he had\r\nimagined, and deemed desirable for her happiness? If she did so she\r\nmust in some measure become the apologist of her husband, and she was\r\nnot prepared to go so far.\r\n\r\nAs for him, he kept her in a mood of considerate gravity. He certainly\r\nhad changed. He had at his worst times always been gentle in his manner\r\ntowards her. Could it be that she might make of him a true and worthy\r\nhusband yet? She had married him; there was no getting over that; and\r\nought she any longer to keep him at a distance? His suave deference to\r\nher lightest whim on the question of his comings and goings, when as\r\nher lawful husband he might show a little independence, was a trait in\r\nhis character as unexpected as it was engaging. If she had been his\r\nempress, and he her thrall, he could not have exhibited a more\r\nsensitive care to avoid intruding upon her against her will.\r\n\r\nImpelled by a remembrance she took down a prayer-book and turned to the\r\nmarriage-service. Reading it slowly through, she became quite appalled\r\nat her recent off-handedness, when she rediscovered what awfully solemn\r\npromises she had made him at those chancel steps not so very long ago.\r\n\r\nShe became lost in long ponderings on how far a person\xe2\x80\x99s conscience\r\nmight be bound by vows made without at the time a full recognition of\r\ntheir force. That particular sentence, beginning \xe2\x80\x9cWhom God hath joined\r\ntogether,\xe2\x80\x9d was a staggerer for a gentlewoman of strong devotional\r\nsentiment. She wondered whether God really did join them together.\r\nBefore she had done deliberating the time of her engagement drew near,\r\nand she went out of the house almost at the moment that Tim Tangs\r\nretired to his own.\r\n\r\nThe position of things at that critical juncture was briefly as\r\nfollows.\r\n\r\nTwo hundred yards to the right of the upper end of Tangs\xe2\x80\x99s garden\r\nFitzpiers was still advancing, having now nearly reached the summit of\r\nthe wood-clothed ridge, the path being the actual one which further on\r\npassed between the two young oaks. Thus far it was according to Tim\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconjecture. But about two hundred yards to the left, or rather less,\r\nwas arising a condition which he had not divined, the emergence of\r\nGrace as aforesaid from the upper corner of her father\xe2\x80\x99s garden, with\r\nthe view of meeting Tim\xe2\x80\x99s intended victim. Midway between husband and\r\nwife was the diabolical trap, silent, open, ready.\r\n\r\nFitzpiers\xe2\x80\x99s walk that night had been cheerful, for he was convinced\r\nthat the slow and gentle method he had adopted was promising success.\r\nThe very restraint that he was obliged to exercise upon himself, so as\r\nnot to kill the delicate bud of returning confidence, fed his flame. He\r\nwalked so much more rapidly than Grace that, if they continued\r\nadvancing as they had begun, he would reach the trap a good half-minute\r\nbefore she could reach the same spot.\r\n\r\nBut here a new circumstance came in; to escape the unpleasantness of\r\nbeing watched or listened to by lurkers\xe2\x80\x94naturally curious by reason of\r\ntheir strained relations\xe2\x80\x94they had arranged that their meeting for\r\nto-night should be at the holm-tree on the ridge above named. So soon,\r\naccordingly, as Fitzpiers reached the tree he stood still to await her.\r\n\r\nHe had not paused under the prickly foliage more than two minutes when\r\nhe thought he heard a scream from the other side of the ridge.\r\nFitzpiers wondered what it could mean; but such wind as there was just\r\nnow blew in an adverse direction, and his mood was light. He set down\r\nthe origin of the sound to one of the superstitious freaks or\r\nfrolicsome scrimmages between sweethearts that still survived in\r\nHintock from old-English times; and waited on where he stood till ten\r\nminutes had passed. Feeling then a little uneasy, his mind reverted to\r\nthe scream; and he went forward over the summit and down the embowered\r\nincline, till he reached the pair of sister oaks with the narrow\r\nopening between them.\r\n\r\nFitzpiers stumbled and all but fell. Stretching down his hand to\r\nascertain the obstruction, it came in contact with a confused mass of\r\nsilken drapery and iron-work that conveyed absolutely no explanatory\r\nidea to his mind at all. It was but the work of a moment to strike a\r\nmatch; and then he saw a sight which congealed his blood.\r\n\r\nThe man-trap was thrown; and between its jaws was part of a woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nclothing\xe2\x80\x94a patterned silk skirt\xe2\x80\x94gripped with such violence that the\r\niron teeth had passed through it, skewering its tissue in a score of\r\nplaces. He immediately recognized the skirt as that of one of his\r\nwife\xe2\x80\x99s gowns\xe2\x80\x94the gown that she had worn when she met him on the very\r\nlast occasion.\r\n\r\nFitzpiers had often studied the effect of these instruments when\r\nexamining the collection at Hintock House, and the conception instantly\r\nflashed through him that Grace had been caught, taken out mangled by\r\nsome chance passer, and carried home, some of her clothes being left\r\nbehind in the difficulty of getting her free. The shock of this\r\nconviction, striking into the very current of high hope, was so great\r\nthat he cried out like one in corporal agony, and in his misery bowed\r\nhimself down to the ground.\r\n\r\nOf all the degrees and qualities of punishment that Fitzpiers had\r\nundergone since his sins against Grace first began, not any even\r\napproximated in intensity to this.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my own\xe2\x80\x94my darling! Oh, cruel Heaven\xe2\x80\x94it is too much, this!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncried, writhing and rocking himself over the sorry accessories of her\r\nhe deplored.\r\n\r\nThe voice of his distress was sufficiently loud to be audible to any\r\none who might have been there to hear it; and one there was. Right and\r\nleft of the narrow pass between the oaks were dense bushes; and now\r\nfrom behind these a female figure glided, whose appearance even in the\r\ngloom was, though graceful in outline, noticeably strange.\r\n\r\nShe was in white up to the waist, and figured above. She was, in short,\r\nGrace, his wife, lacking the portion of her dress which the gin\r\nretained.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be grieved about me\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t, dear Edgar!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, rushing\r\nup and bending over him. \xe2\x80\x9cI am not hurt a bit! I was coming on to find\r\nyou after I had released myself, but I heard footsteps; and I hid away,\r\nbecause I was without some of my clothing, and I did not know who the\r\nperson might be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFitzpiers had sprung to his feet, and his next act was no less\r\nunpremeditated by him than it was irresistible by her, and would have\r\nbeen so by any woman not of Amazonian strength. He clasped his arms\r\ncompletely round, pressed her to his breast, and kissed her\r\npassionately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not dead!\xe2\x80\x94you are not hurt! Thank God\xe2\x80\x94thank God!\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\nalmost sobbing in his delight and relief from the horror of his\r\napprehension. \xe2\x80\x9cGrace, my wife, my love, how is this\xe2\x80\x94what has happened?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was coming on to you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said as distinctly as she could in the\r\nhalf-smothered state of her face against his. \xe2\x80\x9cI was trying to be as\r\npunctual as possible, and as I had started a minute late I ran along\r\nthe path very swiftly\xe2\x80\x94fortunately for myself. Just when I had passed\r\nbetween these trees I felt something clutch at my dress from behind\r\nwith a noise, and the next moment I was pulled backward by it, and fell\r\nto the ground. I screamed with terror, thinking it was a man lying down\r\nthere to murder me, but the next moment I discovered it was iron, and\r\nthat my clothes were caught in a trap. I pulled this way and that, but\r\nthe thing would not let go, drag it as I would, and I did not know what\r\nto do. I did not want to alarm my father or anybody, as I wished nobody\r\nto know of these meetings with you; so I could think of no other plan\r\nthan slipping off my skirt, meaning to run on and tell you what a\r\nstrange accident had happened to me. But when I had just freed myself\r\nby leaving the dress behind, I heard steps, and not being sure it was\r\nyou, I did not like to be seen in such a pickle, so I hid away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was only your speed that saved you! One or both of your legs would\r\nhave been broken if you had come at ordinary walking pace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr yours, if you had got here first,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, beginning to realize\r\nthe whole ghastliness of the possibility. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Edgar, there has been an\r\nEye watching over us to-night, and we should be thankful indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe continued to press his face to hers. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are mine\xe2\x80\x94mine again now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe gently owned that she supposed she was. \xe2\x80\x9cI heard what you said when\r\nyou thought I was injured,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, shyly, \xe2\x80\x9cand I know that a man\r\nwho could suffer as you were suffering must have a tender regard for\r\nme. But how does this awful thing come here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose it has something to do with poachers.\xe2\x80\x9d Fitzpiers was still\r\nso shaken by the sense of her danger that he was obliged to sit awhile,\r\nand it was not until Grace said, \xe2\x80\x9cIf I could only get my skirt out\r\nnobody would know anything about it,\xe2\x80\x9d that he bestirred himself.\r\n\r\nBy their united efforts, each standing on one of the springs of the\r\ntrap, they pressed them down sufficiently to insert across the jaws a\r\nbillet which they dragged from a faggot near at hand; and it was then\r\npossible to extract the silk mouthful from the monster\xe2\x80\x99s bite, creased\r\nand pierced with many holes, but not torn. Fitzpiers assisted her to\r\nput it on again; and when her customary contours were thus restored\r\nthey walked on together, Grace taking his arm, till he effected an\r\nimprovement by clasping it round her waist.\r\n\r\nThe ice having been broken in this unexpected manner, she made no\r\nfurther attempt at reserve. \xe2\x80\x9cI would ask you to come into the house,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut my meetings with you have been kept secret from my\r\nfather, and I should like to prepare him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind, dearest. I could not very well have accepted the\r\ninvitation. I shall never live here again\xe2\x80\x94as much for your sake as for\r\nmine. I have news to tell you on this very point, but my alarm had put\r\nit out of my head. I have bought a practice, or rather a partnership,\r\nin the Midlands, and I must go there in a week to take up permanent\r\nresidence. My poor old great-aunt died about eight months ago, and left\r\nme enough to do this. I have taken a little furnished house for a time,\r\ntill we can get one of our own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe described the place, and the surroundings, and the view from the\r\nwindows, and Grace became much interested. \xe2\x80\x9cBut why are you not there\r\nnow?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I cannot tear myself away from here till I have your promise.\r\nNow, darling, you will accompany me there\xe2\x80\x94will you not? To-night has\r\nsettled that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrace\xe2\x80\x99s tremblings had gone off, and she did not say nay. They went on\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nThe adventure, and the emotions consequent upon the reunion which that\r\nevent had forced on, combined to render Grace oblivious of the\r\ndirection of their desultory ramble, till she noticed they were in an\r\nencircled glade in the densest part of the wood, whereon the moon, that\r\nhad imperceptibly added its rays to the scene, shone almost vertically.\r\nIt was an exceptionally soft, balmy evening for the time of year, which\r\nwas just that transient period in the May month when beech-trees have\r\nsuddenly unfolded large limp young leaves of the softness of\r\nbutterflies\xe2\x80\x99 wings. Boughs bearing such leaves hung low around, and\r\ncompletely enclosed them, so that it was as if they were in a great\r\ngreen vase, which had moss for its bottom and leaf sides.\r\n\r\nThe clouds having been packed in the west that evening so as to retain\r\nthe departing glare a long while, the hour had seemed much earlier than\r\nit was. But suddenly the question of time occurred to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must go back,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; and without further delay they set their\r\nfaces towards Hintock. As they walked he examined his watch by the aid\r\nof the now strong moonlight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the gods, I think I have lost my train!\xe2\x80\x9d said Fitzpiers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear me\xe2\x80\x94whereabouts are we?\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo miles in the direction of Sherton.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen do you hasten on, Edgar. I am not in the least afraid. I\r\nrecognize now the part of the wood we are in and I can find my way back\r\nquite easily. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell my father that we have made it up. I wish I had\r\nnot kept our meetings so private, for it may vex him a little to know I\r\nhave been seeing you. He is getting old and irritable, that was why I\r\ndid not. Good-by.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, as I must stay at the Earl of Wessex to-night, for I cannot\r\npossibly catch the train, I think it would be safer for you to let me\r\ntake care of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what will my father think has become of me? He does not know in\r\nthe least where I am\xe2\x80\x94he thinks I only went into the garden for a few\r\nminutes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe will surely guess\xe2\x80\x94somebody has seen me for certain. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go all the\r\nway back with you to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that newly done-up place\xe2\x80\x94the Earl of Wessex!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you are so very particular about the publicity I will stay at the\r\nThree Tuns.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no\xe2\x80\x94it is not that I am particular\xe2\x80\x94but I haven\xe2\x80\x99t a brush or comb or\r\nanything!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the evening Melbury had been coming to his door, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder\r\nwhere in the world that girl is! Never in all my born days did I know\r\nher bide out like this! She surely said she was going into the garden\r\nto get some parsley.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMelbury searched the garden, the parsley-bed, and the orchard, but\r\ncould find no trace of her, and then he made inquiries at the cottages\r\nof such of his workmen as had not gone to bed, avoiding Tangs\xe2\x80\x99s because\r\nhe knew the young people were to rise early to leave. In these\r\ninquiries one of the men\xe2\x80\x99s wives somewhat incautiously let out the fact\r\nthat she had heard a scream in the wood, though from which direction\r\nshe could not say.\r\n\r\nThis set Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s fears on end. He told the men to light lanterns, and\r\nheaded by himself they started, Creedle following at the last moment\r\nwith quite a burden of grapnels and ropes, which he could not be\r\npersuaded to leave behind, and the company being joined by the\r\nhollow-turner and the man who kept the cider-house as they went along.\r\n\r\nThey explored the precincts of the village, and in a short time lighted\r\nupon the man-trap. Its discovery simply added an item of fact without\r\nhelping their conjectures; but Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s indefinite alarm was greatly\r\nincreased when, holding a candle to the ground, he saw in the teeth of\r\nthe instrument some frayings from Grace\xe2\x80\x99s clothing. No intelligence of\r\nany kind was gained till they met a woodman of Delborough, who said\r\nthat he had seen a lady answering to the description her father gave of\r\nGrace, walking through the wood on a gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s arm in the direction\r\nof Sherton.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas he clutching her tight?\xe2\x80\x9d said Melbury.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94rather,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid she walk lame?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, \xe2\x80\x99tis true her head hung over towards him a bit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCreedle groaned tragically.\r\n\r\nMelbury, not suspecting the presence of Fitzpiers, coupled this account\r\nwith the man-trap and the scream; he could not understand what it all\r\nmeant; but the sinister event of the trap made him follow on.\r\nAccordingly, they bore away towards the town, shouting as they went,\r\nand in due course emerged upon the highway.\r\n\r\nNearing Sherton-Abbas, the previous information was confirmed by other\r\nstrollers, though the gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s supporting arm had disappeared from\r\nthese later accounts. At last they were so near Sherton that Melbury\r\ninformed his faithful followers that he did not wish to drag them\r\nfarther at so late an hour, since he could go on alone and inquire if\r\nthe woman who had been seen were really Grace. But they would not leave\r\nhim alone in his anxiety, and trudged onward till the lamplight from\r\nthe town began to illuminate their fronts. At the entrance to the High\r\nStreet they got fresh scent of the pursued, but coupled with the new\r\ncondition that the lady in the costume described had been going up the\r\nstreet alone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFaith!\xe2\x80\x94I believe she\xe2\x80\x99s mesmerized, or walking in her sleep,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMelbury.\r\n\r\nHowever, the identity of this woman with Grace was by no means certain;\r\nbut they plodded along the street. Percombe, the hair-dresser, who had\r\ndespoiled Marty of her tresses, was standing at his door, and they duly\r\nput inquiries to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\x94how\xe2\x80\x99s Little Hintock folk by now?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, before replying. \xe2\x80\x9cNever\r\nhave I been over there since one winter night some three year ago\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nthen I lost myself finding it. How can ye live in such a one-eyed\r\nplace? Great Hintock is bad enough\xe2\x80\x94hut Little Hintock\xe2\x80\x94the bats and owls\r\nwould drive me melancholy-mad! It took two days to raise my sperrits to\r\ntheir true pitch again after that night I went there. Mr. Melbury, sir,\r\nas a man\xe2\x80\x99s that put by money, why not retire and live here, and see\r\nsomething of the world?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe responses at last given by him to their queries guided them to the\r\nbuilding that offered the best accommodation in Sherton\xe2\x80\x94having been\r\nenlarged contemporaneously with the construction of the railway\xe2\x80\x94namely,\r\nthe Earl of Wessex Hotel.\r\n\r\nLeaving the others without, Melbury made prompt inquiry here. His alarm\r\nwas lessened, though his perplexity was increased, when he received a\r\nbrief reply that such a lady was in the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know if it is my daughter?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Melbury.\r\n\r\nThe waiter did not.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know the lady\xe2\x80\x99s name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOf this, too, the household was ignorant, the hotel having been taken\r\nby brand-new people from a distance. They knew the gentleman very well\r\nby sight, and had not thought it necessary to ask him to enter his\r\nname.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, the gentleman appears again now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Melbury to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\r\nI want to see the lady,\xe2\x80\x9d he declared.\r\n\r\nA message was taken up, and after some delay the shape of Grace\r\nappeared descending round the bend of the stair-case, looking as if she\r\nlived there, but in other respects rather guilty and frightened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy\xe2\x80\x94what the name\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d began her father. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought you went out to get\r\nparsley!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes\xe2\x80\x94I did\xe2\x80\x94but it is all right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Grace, in a flurried whisper.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not alone here. I am here with Edgar. It is entirely owing to an\r\naccident, father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEdgar! An accident! How does he come here? I thought he was two\r\nhundred mile off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, so he is\xe2\x80\x94I mean he has got a beautiful practice two hundred miles\r\noff; he has bought it with his own money, some that came to him. But he\r\ntravelled here, and I was nearly caught in a man-trap, and that\xe2\x80\x99s how\r\nit is I am here. We were just thinking of sending a messenger to let\r\nyou know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMelbury did not seem to be particularly enlightened by this\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were caught in a man-trap?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; my dress was. That\xe2\x80\x99s how it arose. Edgar is up-stairs in his own\r\nsitting-room,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on. \xe2\x80\x9cHe would not mind seeing you, I am sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, faith, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to see him! I have seen him too often a\xe2\x80\x99ready.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll see him another time, perhaps, if \xe2\x80\x99tis to oblige \xe2\x80\x99ee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe came to see me; he wanted to consult me about this large\r\npartnership I speak of, as it is very promising.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I am glad to hear it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Melbury, dryly.\r\n\r\nA pause ensued, during which the inquiring faces and whity-brown\r\nclothes of Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s companions appeared in the door-way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen bain\xe2\x80\x99t you coming home with us?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I think not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Grace, blushing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cH\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x94very well\xe2\x80\x94you are your own mistress,\xe2\x80\x9d he returned, in tones which\r\nseemed to assert otherwise. \xe2\x80\x9cGood-night;\xe2\x80\x9d and Melbury retreated towards\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be angry, father,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, following him a few steps. \xe2\x80\x9cI have\r\ndone it for the best.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not angry, though it is true I have been a little misled in this.\r\nHowever, good-night. I must get home along.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe left the hotel, not without relief, for to be under the eyes of\r\nstrangers while he conversed with his lost child had embarrassed him\r\nmuch. His search-party, too, had looked awkward there, having rushed to\r\nthe task of investigation\xe2\x80\x94some in their shirt sleeves, others in their\r\nleather aprons, and all much stained\xe2\x80\x94just as they had come from their\r\nwork of barking, and not in their Sherton marketing attire; while\r\nCreedle, with his ropes and grapnels and air of impending tragedy, had\r\nadded melancholy to gawkiness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, neighbors,\xe2\x80\x9d said Melbury, on joining them, \xe2\x80\x9cas it is getting\r\nlate, we\xe2\x80\x99ll leg it home again as fast as we can. I ought to tell you\r\nthat there has been some mistake\xe2\x80\x94some arrangement entered into between\r\nMr. and Mrs. Fitzpiers which I didn\xe2\x80\x99t quite understand\xe2\x80\x94an important\r\npractice in the Midland counties has come to him, which made it\r\nnecessary for her to join him to-night\xe2\x80\x94so she says. That\xe2\x80\x99s all it\r\nwas\xe2\x80\x94and I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry I dragged you out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the hollow-turner, \xe2\x80\x9chere be we six mile from home, and\r\nnight-time, and not a hoss or four-footed creeping thing to our name. I\r\nsay, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a mossel and a drop o\xe2\x80\x99 summat to strengthen our nerves\r\nafore we vamp all the way back again? My throat\xe2\x80\x99s as dry as a kex. What\r\nd\xe2\x80\x99ye say so\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey all concurred in the need for this course, and proceeded to the\r\nantique and lampless back street, in which the red curtain of the Three\r\nTuns was the only radiant object. As soon as they had stumbled down\r\ninto the room Melbury ordered them to be served, when they made\r\nthemselves comfortable by the long table, and stretched out their legs\r\nupon the herring-boned sand of the floor. Melbury himself, restless as\r\nusual, walked to the door while he waited for them, and looked up and\r\ndown the street.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d gie her a good shaking if she were my maid; pretending to go out\r\nin the garden, and leading folk a twelve-mile traipse that have got to\r\nget up at five o\xe2\x80\x99clock to morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d said a bark-ripper; who, not working\r\nregularly for Melbury, could afford to indulge in strong opinions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t speak so warm as that,\xe2\x80\x9d said the hollow-turner, \xe2\x80\x9cbut if \xe2\x80\x99tis\r\nright for couples to make a country talk about their separating, and\r\nexcite the neighbors, and then make fools of \xe2\x80\x99em like this, why, I\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t stood upon one leg for five-and-twenty year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll his listeners knew that when he alluded to his foot-lathe in these\r\nenigmatic terms, the speaker meant to be impressive; and Creedle chimed\r\nin with, \xe2\x80\x9cAh, young women do wax wanton in these days! Why couldn\xe2\x80\x99t she\r\nha\xe2\x80\x99 bode with her father, and been faithful?\xe2\x80\x9d Poor Creedle was thinking\r\nof his old employer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut this deceiving of folks is nothing unusual in matrimony,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nFarmer Bawtree. \xe2\x80\x9cI knowed a man and wife\xe2\x80\x94faith, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind owning, as\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s no strangers here, that the pair were my own relations\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nbe at it that hot one hour that you\xe2\x80\x99d hear the poker and the tongs and\r\nthe bellows and the warming-pan flee across the house with the\r\nmovements of their vengeance; and the next hour you\xe2\x80\x99d hear \xe2\x80\x99em singing\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The Spotted Cow\xe2\x80\x99 together as peaceable as two holy twins; yes\xe2\x80\x94and very\r\ngood voices they had, and would strike in like professional\r\nballet-singers to one another\xe2\x80\x99s support in the high notes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I knowed a woman, and the husband o\xe2\x80\x99 her went away for\r\nfour-and-twenty year,\xe2\x80\x9d said the bark-ripper. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd one night he came\r\nhome when she was sitting by the fire, and thereupon he sat down\r\nhimself on the other side of the chimney-corner. \xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 says she,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98have ye got any news?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t know as I have,\xe2\x80\x99 says he; \xe2\x80\x98have you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 says she, \xe2\x80\x98except that my daughter by my second husband was\r\nmarried last month, which was a year after I was made a widow by him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! Anything else?\xe2\x80\x99 he says. \xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 says she. And there they sat, one\r\non each side of that chimney-corner, and were found by their neighbors\r\nsound asleep in their chairs, not having known what to talk about at\r\nall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I don\xe2\x80\x99t care who the man is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Creedle, \xe2\x80\x9cthey required a\r\ngood deal to talk about, and that\xe2\x80\x99s true. It won\xe2\x80\x99t be the same with\r\nthese.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. He is such a projick, you see. And she is a wonderful scholar\r\ntoo!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat women do know nowadays!\xe2\x80\x9d observed the hollow-turner. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndeceive \xe2\x80\x99em as you could in my time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat they knowed then was not small,\xe2\x80\x9d said John Upjohn. \xe2\x80\x9cAlways a good\r\ndeal more than the men! Why, when I went courting my wife that is now,\r\nthe skilfulness that she would show in keeping me on her pretty side as\r\nshe walked was beyond all belief. Perhaps you\xe2\x80\x99ve noticed that she\xe2\x80\x99s got\r\na pretty side to her face as well as a plain one?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t say I\xe2\x80\x99ve noticed it particular much,\xe2\x80\x9d said the hollow-turner,\r\nblandly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Upjohn, not disconcerted, \xe2\x80\x9cshe has. All women under\r\nthe sun be prettier one side than t\xe2\x80\x99other. And, as I was saying, the\r\npains she would take to make me walk on the pretty side were unending!\r\nI warrant that whether we were going with the sun or against the sun,\r\nuphill or downhill, in wind or in lewth, that wart of hers was always\r\ntowards the hedge, and that dimple towards me. There was I, too simple\r\nto see her wheelings and turnings; and she so artful, though two years\r\nyounger, that she could lead me with a cotton thread, like a blind ram;\r\nfor that was in the third climate of our courtship. No; I don\xe2\x80\x99t think\r\nthe women have got cleverer, for they was never otherwise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow many climates may there be in courtship, Mr. Upjohn?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired a\r\nyouth\xe2\x80\x94the same who had assisted at Winterborne\xe2\x80\x99s Christmas party.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFive\xe2\x80\x94from the coolest to the hottest\xe2\x80\x94leastwise there was five in\r\nmine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan ye give us the chronicle of \xe2\x80\x99em, Mr. Upjohn?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94I could. I could certainly. But \xe2\x80\x99tis quite unnecessary. They\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ncome to ye by nater, young man, too soon for your good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt present Mrs. Fitzpiers can lead the doctor as your mis\xe2\x80\x99ess could\r\nlead you,\xe2\x80\x9d the hollow-turner remarked. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s got him quite tame. But\r\nhow long \xe2\x80\x99twill last I can\xe2\x80\x99t say. I happened to be setting a wire on\r\nthe top of my garden one night when he met her on the other side of the\r\nhedge; and the way she queened it, and fenced, and kept that poor\r\nfeller at a distance, was enough to freeze yer blood. I should never\r\nhave supposed it of such a girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMelbury now returned to the room, and the men having declared\r\nthemselves refreshed, they all started on the homeward journey, which\r\nwas by no means cheerless under the rays of the high moon. Having to\r\nwalk the whole distance they came by a foot-path rather shorter than\r\nthe highway, though difficult except to those who knew the country\r\nwell. This brought them by way of Great Hintock; and passing the\r\nchurch-yard they observed, as they talked, a motionless figure standing\r\nby the gate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think it was Marty South,\xe2\x80\x9d said the hollow-turner, parenthetically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think \xe2\x80\x99twas; \xe2\x80\x99a was always a lonely maid,\xe2\x80\x9d said Upjohn. And they\r\npassed on homeward, and thought of the matter no more.\r\n\r\nIt was Marty, as they had supposed. That evening had been the\r\nparticular one of the week upon which Grace and herself had been\r\naccustomed to privately deposit flowers on Giles\xe2\x80\x99s grave, and this was\r\nthe first occasion since his death, eight months earlier, on which\r\nGrace had failed to keep her appointment. Marty had waited in the road\r\njust outside Little Hintock, where her fellow-pilgrim had been wont to\r\njoin her, till she was weary; and at last, thinking that Grace had\r\nmissed her and gone on alone, she followed the way to Great Hintock,\r\nbut saw no Grace in front of her. It got later, and Marty continued her\r\nwalk till she reached the church-yard gate; but still no Grace. Yet her\r\nsense of comradeship would not allow her to go on to the grave alone,\r\nand still thinking the delay had been unavoidable, she stood there with\r\nher little basket of flowers in her clasped hands, and her feet chilled\r\nby the damp ground, till more than two hours had passed.\r\n\r\nShe then heard the footsteps of Melbury\xe2\x80\x99s men, who presently passed on\r\ntheir return from the search. In the silence of the night Marty could\r\nnot help hearing fragments of their conversation, from which she\r\nacquired a general idea of what had occurred, and where Mrs. Fitzpiers\r\nthen was.\r\n\r\nImmediately they had dropped down the hill she entered the church-yard,\r\ngoing to a secluded corner behind the bushes, where rose the unadorned\r\nstone that marked the last bed of Giles Winterborne. As this solitary\r\nand silent girl stood there in the moonlight, a straight slim figure,\r\nclothed in a plaitless gown, the contours of womanhood so undeveloped\r\nas to be scarcely perceptible, the marks of poverty and toil effaced by\r\nthe misty hour, she touched sublimity at points, and looked almost like\r\na being who had rejected with indifference the attribute of sex for the\r\nloftier quality of abstract humanism. She stooped down and cleared away\r\nthe withered flowers that Grace and herself had laid there the previous\r\nweek, and put her fresh ones in their place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, my own, own love,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are mine, and on\xe2\x80\x99y mine;\r\nfor she has forgot \xe2\x80\x99ee at last, although for her you died.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\r\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\'s website\r\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
