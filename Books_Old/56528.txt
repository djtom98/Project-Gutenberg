M. DENT & SONS LTD.\r\n\r\nAldine House--Bedford St.--London\r\n\r\n1885\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduction By Havelock Ellis\r\n\r\n\r\n\'GERMINAL\' was published in 1885, after occupying Zola during the\r\nprevious year. In accordance with his usual custom--but to a greater\r\nextent than with any other of his books except _La D\xc3\xa9b\xc3\xa2cle_--he\r\naccumulated material beforehand. For six months he travelled about\r\nthe coal-mining district in northern France and Belgium, especially\r\nthe Borinage around Mons, note-book in hand. \'He was inquisitive, was\r\nthat gentleman\', miner told Sherard who visited the neighbourhood at a\r\nlater period and found that the miners in every village knew _Germinal_.\r\nThat was a tribute of admiration the book deserved, but it was never\r\none of Zola\'s most popular novels; it was neither amusing enough nor\r\noutrageous enough to attract the multitude.\r\n\r\nYet _Germinal_ occupies a place among Zola\'s works which is constantly\r\nbecoming more assured, so that to some critics it even begins to seem\r\nthe only book of his that in the end may survive. In his own time, as\r\nwe know, the accredited critics of the day could find no condemnation\r\nsevere enough for Zola. Bruneti\xc3\xa8re attacked him perpetually with a fury\r\nthat seemed inexhaustible; Sch\xc3\xa9rer could not even bear to hear his name\r\nmentioned; Anatole France, though he lived to relent, thought it would\r\nhave been better if he had never been born. Even at that time, however,\r\nthere were critics who inclined to view _Germinal_ more favourably. Thus\r\nFaguet, who was the recognized academic critic of the end of the last\r\ncentury, while he held that posterity would be unable to understand how\r\nZola could ever have been popular, yet recognized him as in _Germinal_\r\nthe heroic representative of democracy, incomparable in his power of\r\ndescribing crowds, and he realized how marvellous is the conclusion of\r\nthis book.\r\n\r\nTo-day, when critics view Zola In the main with indifference rather\r\nthan with horror, although he still retains his popular favour, the\r\ndistinction of _Germinal_ is yet more clearly recognized. Seilli\xc3\xa8re,\r\nwhile regarding the capitalistic conditions presented as now of an\r\nancient and almost extinct type, yet sees _Germinal_ standing out as\r\n\'the poem of social mysticism\', while Andr\xc3\xa9 Gide, a completely modern\r\ncritic who has left a deep mark on the present generation, observes\r\nsomewhere that it may nowadays cause surprise that he should refer with\r\nadmiration to _Germinal_, but it is a masterly book that fills him with\r\nastonishment; he can hardly believe that it was written in French and\r\nstill less that it should have been written in any other language; it\r\nseems that it should have been created in some international tongue.\r\n\r\nThe high place thus claimed for _Germinal_ will hardly seem exaggerated.\r\nThe book was produced when Zola had at length achieved the full mastery\r\nof his art and before his hand had, as in his latest novels, begun to\r\nlose its firm grasp. The subject lent itself, moreover, to his special\r\naptitude for presenting in vivid outline great human groups, and to his\r\nspecial sympathy with the collective emotions and social aspirations of\r\nsuch groups. We do not, as so often in Zola\'s work, become painfully\r\nconscious that he is seeking to reproduce aspects of life with which\r\nhe is imperfectly acquainted, or fitting them into scientific formulas\r\nwhich he has imperfectly understood. He shows a masterly grip of each\r\nseparate group, and each represents some essential element of the\r\nwhole; they are harmoniously balanced, and their mutual action and\r\nreaction leads on inevitably to the splendid tragic dose, with yet its\r\ngreat promise for the future. I will not here discuss Zola\'s literary\r\nart (I have done so in my book of _Affirmations_); it is enough to say\r\nthat, though he was not a great master of style, Zola never again wrote\r\nso finely as here.\r\n\r\nA word may be added to explain how this translation fell to the lot of\r\none whose work has been in other fields. In 1893 the late A. Texeira de\r\nMattos was arranging for private issue a series of complete versions of\r\nsome of Zola\'s chief novels and offered to assign _Germinal_ to me. My\r\ntime was taken up with preliminary but as yet unfruitful preparation\r\nfor what I regarded as my own special task in life, and I felt that I\r\nmust not neglect the opportunity of spending my spare time in making\r\na modest addition to my income. My wife readily fell into the project\r\nand agreed, on the understanding that we shared the proceeds, to act\r\nas my amanuensis. So, in the little Cornish cottage over the sea we\r\nthen occupied, the evenings of the early months of 1894 were spent\r\nover _Germinal_, I translating aloud, and she with swift efficient\r\nuntiring pen following, now and then bettering my English dialogue\r\nwith her pungent wit. In this way I was able to gain a more minute\r\ninsight into the details of Zola\'s work, and a more impressive vision\r\nof the massive structure he here raised, than can easily be acquired\r\nby the mere reader. That joint task has remained an abidingly pleasant\r\nmemory. It is, moreover, a satisfaction to me to know that I have\r\nbeen responsible, however inadequately, for the only complete English\r\nversion of this wonderful book, \'a great fresco,\' as Zola himself\r\ncalled it, a great prose epic, as it has seemed to some, worthy to\r\ncompare with the great verse epics of old.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART ONE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\n\r\nOver the open plain, beneath a starless sky as dark and thick as ink,\r\na man walked alone along the highway from Marchiennes to Montsou, a\r\nstraight paved road ten kilometres in length, intersecting the beetroot\r\nfields. He could not even see the black soil before him, and only felt\r\nthe immense flat horizon by the gusts of March wind, squalls as strong\r\nas on the sea, and frozen from sweeping leagues of marsh and naked\r\nearth. No tree could be seen against the sky, and the road unrolled as\r\nstraight as a pier in the midst of the blinding spray of darkness.\r\n\r\nThe man had set out from Marchiennes about two o\'clock. He walked with\r\nlong strides, shivering beneath his worn cotton jacket and corduroy\r\nbreeches. A small parcel tied in a check handkerchief troubled him\r\nmuch, and he pressed it against his side, sometimes with one elbow,\r\nsometimes with the other, so that he could slip to the bottom of his\r\npockets both the benumbed hands that bled beneath the lashes of the\r\nwind. A single idea occupied his head--the empty head of a workman\r\nwithout work and without lodging--the hope that the cold would be less\r\nkeen after sunrise. For an hour he went on thus, when on the left, two\r\nkilometres from Montsou, he saw red flames, three fires burning in the\r\nopen air and apparently suspended. At first he hesitated, half afraid.\r\nThen he could not resist the painful need to warm his hands for a\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nThe steep road led downwards, and everything disappeared. The man saw\r\non his right a paling, a wall of coarse planks shutting in a line of\r\nrails, while a grassy slope rose on the left surmounted by confused\r\ngables, a vision of a village with low uniform roofs. He went on\r\nsome two hundred paces. Suddenly, at a bend in the road, the fires\r\nreappeared close to him, though he could not understand how they\r\nburnt so high in the dead sky, like smoky moons. But on the level\r\nsoil another sight had struck him. It was a heavy mass, a low pile\r\nof buildings from which rose the silhouette of a factory chimney;\r\noccasional gleams appeared from dirty windows, five or six melancholy\r\nlanterns were hung outside to frames of blackened wood, which vaguely\r\noutlined the profiles of gigantic stages; and from this fantastic\r\napparition, drowned in night and smoke, a single voice arose, the\r\nthick, long breathing of a steam escapement that could not be seen.\r\n\r\nThen the man recognized a pit. His despair returned. What was the\r\ngood? There would be no work. Instead of turning towards the buildings\r\nhe decided at last to ascend the pit bank, on which burnt in iron\r\nbaskets the three coal fires which gave light and warmth for work. The\r\nlabourers in the cutting must have been working late; they were still\r\nthrowing out the useless rubbish. Now he heard the landers push the\r\nwagons on the stages. He could distinguish living shadows tipping over\r\nthe trams or tubs near each fire.\r\n\r\n"Good day," he said, approaching one of the baskets.\r\n\r\nTurning his back to the fire, the carman stood upright. He was an old\r\nman, dressed in knitted violet wool with a rabbit-skin cap on his head;\r\nwhile his horse, a great yellow horse, waited with the immobility of\r\nstone while they emptied the six trains he drew. The workman employed\r\nat the tipping-cradle, a red-haired lean fellow, did not hurry himself;\r\nhe pressed on the lever with a sleepy hand. And above, the wind grew\r\nstronger--an icy north wind--and its great, regular breaths passed by\r\nlike the strokes of a scythe.\r\n\r\n"Good day," replied the old man. There was silence. The man, who felt\r\nthat he was being looked at suspiciously, at once told his name.\r\n\r\n"I am called \xc3\x89tienne Lantier. I am an engine-man. Any work here?"\r\n\r\nThe flames lit him up. He might be about twenty-one years of age, a\r\nvery dark, handsome man, who looked strong in spite of his thin limbs.\r\n\r\nThe carman, thus reassured, shook his head.\r\n\r\n"Work for an engine-man? No, no! There were two came yesterday. There\'s\r\nnothing."\r\n\r\nA gust cut short their speech. Then \xc3\x89tienne asked, pointing to the\r\nsombre pile of buildings at the foot of the platform:\r\n\r\n"A pit, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\nThe old man this time could not reply: he was strangled by a violent\r\ncough. At last he expectorated, and his expectoration left a black\r\npatch on the purple soil.\r\n\r\n"Yes, a pit. The Voreux. There! The settlement is quite near."\r\n\r\nIn his turn, and with extended arm, he pointed out in the night the\r\nvillage of which the young man had vaguely seen the roofs. But the six\r\ntrams were empty, and he followed them without cracking his whip, his\r\nlegs stiffened by rheumatism; while the great yellow horse went on of\r\nitself, pulling heavily between the rails beneath a new gust which\r\nbristled its coat.\r\n\r\nThe Voreux was now emerging from the gloom. \xc3\x89tienne, who forgot himself\r\nbefore the stove, warming his poor bleeding hands, looked round and\r\ncould see each part of the pit: the shed tarred with siftings, the\r\npit-frame, the vast chamber of the winding machine, the square turret\r\nof the exhaustion pump. This pit, piled up in the bottom of a hollow,\r\nwith its squat brick buildings, raising its chimney like a threatening\r\nhorn, seemed to him to have the evil air of a gluttonous beast\r\ncrouching there to devour the earth. While examining it, he thought of\r\nhimself, of his vagabond existence these eight days he had been seeking\r\nwork. He saw himself again at his workshop at the railway, delivering\r\na blow at his foreman, driven from Lille, driven from everywhere. On\r\nSaturday he had arrived at Marchiennes, where they said that work was\r\nto be had at the Forges, and there was nothing, neither at the Forges\r\nnor at Sonneville\'s. He had been obliged to pass the Sunday hidden\r\nbeneath the wood of a cartwright\'s yard, from which the watchman had\r\njust turned him out at two o\'clock in the morning. He had nothing, not\r\na penny, not even a crust; what should he do, wandering along the roads\r\nwithout aim, not knowing where to shelter himself from the wind? Yes,\r\nit was certainly a pit; the occasional lanterns lighted up the square;\r\na door, suddenly opened, had enabled him to catch sight of the furnaces\r\nin a clear light. He could explain even the escapement of the pump,\r\nthat thick, long breathing that went on without ceasing, and which\r\nseemed to be the monster\'s congested respiration.\r\n\r\nThe workman, expanding his back at the tipping-cradle, had not even\r\nlifted his eyes on \xc3\x89tienne, and the latter was about to pick up his\r\nlittle bundle, which had fallen to the earth, when a spasm of coughing\r\nannounced the carman\'s return. Slowly he emerged from the darkness,\r\nfollowed by the yellow horse drawing six more laden trams.\r\n\r\n"Are there factories at Montsou?" asked the young man.\r\n\r\nThe old man expectorated, then replied in the wind:\r\n\r\n"Oh, it isn\'t factories that are lacking. Should have seen it three or\r\nfour years ago. Everything was roaring then. There were not men enough;\r\nthere never were such wages. And now they are tightening their bellies\r\nagain. Nothing but misery in the country; every one is being sent away;\r\nworkshops closing one after the other. It is not the Emperor\'s fault,\r\nperhaps; but why should he go and fight in America? without counting\r\nthat the beasts are dying from cholera, like the people."\r\n\r\nThen, in short sentences and with broken breath, the two continued to\r\ncomplain. \xc3\x89tienne narrated his vain wanderings of the past week: must\r\none, then, die of hunger? Soon the roads would be full of beggars.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said the old man, "this will turn out badly, for God does not\r\nallow so many Christians to be thrown on the street."\r\n\r\n"We don\'t have meat every day."\r\n\r\n"But if one had bread!"\r\n\r\n"True, if one only had bread."\r\n\r\nTheir voices were lost, gusts of wind carrying away the words in a\r\nmelancholy howl.\r\n\r\n"Here!" began the carman again very loudly, turning towards the south.\r\n"Montsou is over there."\r\n\r\nAnd stretching out his hand again he pointed out invisible spots in the\r\ndarkness as he named them. Below, at Montsou, the Fauvelle sugar works\r\nwere still going, but the Hoton sugar works had just been dismissing\r\nhands; there were only the Dutilleul flour mill and the Bleuze rope\r\nwalk for mine-cables which kept up. Then, with a large gesture he\r\nindicated the north half of the horizon: the Sonneville workshops had\r\nnot received two-thirds of their usual orders; only two of the three\r\nblast furnaces of the Marchiennes Forges were alight; finally, at the\r\nGagebois glass works a strike was threatening, for there was talk of a\r\nreduction of wages.\r\n\r\n"I know, I know," replied the young man at each indication. "I have\r\nbeen there."\r\n\r\n"With us here things are going on at present," added the carman; "but\r\nthe pits have lowered their output. And see opposite, at the Victoire,\r\nthere are also only two batteries of coke furnaces alight."\r\n\r\nHe expectorated, and set out behind his sleepy horse, after harnessing\r\nit to the empty trams.\r\n\r\nNow \xc3\x89tienne could oversee the entire country. The darkness remained\r\nprofound, but the old man\'s hand had, as it were, filled it with great\r\nmiseries, which the young man unconsciously felt at this moment around\r\nhim everywhere in the limitless tract. Was it not a cry of famine\r\nthat the March wind rolled up across this naked plain? The squalls\r\nwere furious: they seemed to bring the death of labour, a famine\r\nwhich would kill many men. And with wandering eyes he tried to pierce\r\nshades, tormented at once by the desire and by the fear of seeing.\r\nEverything was hidden in the unknown depths of the gloomy night. He\r\nonly perceived, very far off, the blast furnaces and the coke ovens.\r\nThe latter, with their hundreds of chimneys, planted obliquely, made\r\nlines of red flame; while the two towers, more to the left, burnt blue\r\nagainst the blank sky, like giant torches. It resembled a melancholy\r\nconflagration. No other stars rose on the threatening horizon except\r\nthese nocturnal fires in a land of coal and iron.\r\n\r\n"You belong to Belgium, perhaps?" began again the carman, who had\r\nreturned behind \xc3\x89tienne.\r\n\r\nThis time he only brought three trams. Those at least could be tipped\r\nover; an accident which had happened to the cage, a broken screw nut,\r\nwould stop work for a good quarter of an hour. At the bottom of the pit\r\nbank there was silence; the landers no longer shook the stages with a\r\nprolonged vibration. One only heard from the pit the distant sound of a\r\nhammer tapping on an iron plate.\r\n\r\n"No, I come from the South," replied the young man.\r\n\r\nThe workman, after having emptied the trams, had seated himself on the\r\nearth, glad of the accident, maintaining his savage silence; he had\r\nsimply lifted his large, dim eyes to the carman, as if annoyed by so\r\nmany words. The latter, indeed, did not usually talk at such length.\r\nThe unknown man\'s face must have pleased him that he should have been\r\ntaken by one of these itchings for confidence which sometimes make old\r\npeople talk aloud even when alone.\r\n\r\n"I belong to Montsou," he said, "I am called Bonnemort."\r\n\r\n"Is it a nickname?" asked \xc3\x89tienne, astonished.\r\n\r\nThe old man made a grimace of satisfaction and pointed to the Voreux:\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes; they have pulled me three times out of that, torn to pieces,\r\nonce with all my hair scorched, once with my gizzard full of earth, and\r\nanother time with my belly swollen with water, like a frog. And then,\r\nwhen they saw that nothing would kill me, they called me Bonnemort for\r\na joke."\r\n\r\nHis cheerfulness increased, like the creaking of an ill-greased pulley,\r\nand ended by degenerating into a terrible spasm of coughing. The fire\r\nbasket now clearly lit up his large head, with its scanty white hair\r\nand flat, livid face, spotted with bluish patches. He was short, with\r\nan enormous neck, projecting calves and heels, and long arms, with\r\nmassive hands falling to his knees. For the rest, like his horse, which\r\nstood immovable, without suffering from the wind, he seemed to be\r\nmade of stone; he had no appearance of feeling either the cold or the\r\ngusts that whistled at his ears. When he coughed his throat was torn\r\nby a deep rasping; he spat at the foot of the basket and the earth was\r\nblackened.\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne looked at him and at the ground which he had thus stained.\r\n\r\n"Have you been working long at the mine?"\r\n\r\nBonnemort flung open both arms.\r\n\r\n"Long? I should think so. I was not eight when I went down into the\r\nVoreux and I am now fifty-eight. Reckon that up! I have been everything\r\ndown there; at first trammer, then putter, when I had the strength to\r\nwheel, then pikeman for eighteen years. Then, because of my cursed\r\nlegs, they put me into the earth cutting, to bank up and patch, until\r\nthey had to bring me up, because the doctor said I should stay there\r\nfor good. Then, after five years of that, they made me carman. Eh?\r\nthat\'s fine--fifty years at the mine, forty-five down below."\r\n\r\nWhile he was speaking, fragments of burning coal, which now and then\r\nfell from the basket, lit up his pale face with their red reflection.\r\n\r\n"They tell me to rest," he went on, "but I\'m not going to; I\'m not such\r\na fool. I can get on for two years longer, to my sixtieth, so as to get\r\nthe pension of one hundred and eighty francs. If I wished them good\r\nevening to-day they would give me a hundred and fifty at once. They are\r\ncunning, the beggars. Besides, I am sound, except my legs. You see,\r\nit\'s the water which has got under my skin through being always wet in\r\nthe cuttings. There are days when I can\'t move a paw without screaming."\r\n\r\nA spasm of coughing interrupted him again.\r\n\r\n"And that makes you cough so?" said \xc3\x89tienne.\r\n\r\nBut he vigorously shook his head. Then, when he could speak:\r\n\r\n"No, no! I caught cold a month ago. I never used to cough; now I can\'t\r\nget rid of it. And the queer thing is that I spit, that I spit----"\r\n\r\nThe rasping was again heard in his throat, followed by the black\r\nexpectoration.\r\n\r\n"Is it blood?" asked \xc3\x89tienne, at last venturing to question him.\r\n\r\nBonnemort slowly wiped his mouth with the back of his hand.\r\n\r\n"It\'s coal. I\'ve got enough in my carcass to warm me till I die. And\r\nit\'s five years since I put a foot down below. I stored it up, it\r\nseems, without knowing it; it keeps you alive!"\r\n\r\nThere was silence. The distant hammer struck regular blows in the\r\npit, and the wind passed by with its moan, like a cry of hunger and\r\nweariness coming out of the depths of the night. Before the flames\r\nwhich grew low, the old man went on in lower tones, chewing over again\r\nhis old recollections. Ah, certainly: it was not yesterday that he and\r\nhis began hammering at the seam. The family had worked for the Montsou\r\nMining Company since it started, and that was long ago, a hundred and\r\nsix years already. His grandfather, Guillaume Maheu, an urchin of\r\nfifteen then, had found the rich coal at R\xc3\xa9quillart, the Company\'s\r\nfirst pit, an old abandoned pit to-day down below near the Fauvelle\r\nsugar works. All the country knew it, and as a proof, the discovered\r\nseam was called the Guillaume, after his grandfather. He had not known\r\nhim--a big fellow, it was said, very strong, who died of old age at\r\nsixty. Then his father, Nicolas Maheu, called Le Rouge, when hardly\r\nforty years of age had died in the pit, which was being excavated at\r\nthat time: a landslip, a complete slide, and the rock drank his blood\r\nand swallowed his bones. Two of his uncles and his three brothers,\r\nlater on, also left their skins there. He, Vincent Maheu, who had come\r\nout almost whole, except that his legs were rather shaky, was looked\r\nupon as a knowing fellow. But what could one do? One must work; one\r\nworked here from father to son, as one would work at anything else.\r\nHis son, Toussaint Maheu, was being worked to death there now, and his\r\ngrandsons, and all his people, who lived opposite in the settlement.\r\nA hundred and six years of mining, the youngsters after the old ones,\r\nfor the same master. Eh? there were many bourgeois that could not give\r\ntheir history so well!\r\n\r\n"Anyhow, when one has got enough to eat!" murmured \xc3\x89tienne again.\r\n\r\n"That is what I say. As long as one has bread to eat one can live."\r\n\r\nBonnemort was silent; and his eyes turned towards the settlement, where\r\nlights were appearing one by one. Four o\'clock struck in the Montsou\r\ntower and the cold became keener.\r\n\r\n"And is your company rich?" asked \xc3\x89tienne.\r\n\r\nThe old man shrugged his shoulders, and then let them fall as if\r\noverwhelmed beneath an avalanche of gold.\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes! Ah, yes! Not perhaps so rich as its neighbour, the Anzin\r\nCompany. But millions and millions all the same. They can\'t count it.\r\nNineteen pits, thirteen at work, the Voreux, the Victoire, Cr\xc3\xa9vecoeur,\r\nMirou, St. Thomas, Madeleine, Feutry-Cantel, and still more, and six\r\nfor pumping or ventilation, like R\xc3\xa9quillart. Ten thousand workers,\r\nconcessions reaching over sixty-seven communes, an output of five\r\nthousand tons a day, a railway joining all the pits, and workshops, and\r\nfactories! Ah, yes! ah, yes! there\'s money there!"\r\n\r\nThe rolling of trams on the stages made the big yellow horse prick his\r\nears. The cage was evidently repaired below, and the landers had got to\r\nwork again. While he was harnessing his beast to re-descend, the carman\r\nadded gently, addressing himself to the horse:\r\n\r\n"Won\'t do to chatter, lazy good-for-nothing! If Monsieur Hennebeau knew\r\nhow you waste your time!"\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne looked thoughtfully into the night. He asked:\r\n\r\n"Then Monsieur Hennebeau owns the mine?"\r\n\r\n"No," explained the old man, "Monsieur Hennebeau is only the general\r\nmanager; he is paid just the same as us."\r\n\r\nWith a gesture the young man pointed into the darkness.\r\n\r\n"Who does it all belong to, then?"\r\n\r\nBut Bonnemort was for a moment so suffocated by a new and violent spasm\r\nthat he could not get his breath. Then, when he had expectorated and\r\nwiped the black froth from his lips, he replied in the rising wind:\r\n\r\n"Eh? all that belong to? Nobody knows. To people."\r\n\r\nAnd with his hand he pointed in the darkness to a vague spot, an\r\nunknown and remote place, inhabited by those people for whom the Maheus\r\nhad been hammering at the seam for more than a century. His voice\r\nassumed a tone of religious awe; it was as if he were speaking of an\r\ninaccessible tabernacle containing a sated and crouching god to whom\r\nthey had given all their flesh and whom they had never seen.\r\n\r\n"At all events, if one can get enough bread to eat," repeated \xc3\x89tienne,\r\nfor the third time, without any apparent transition.\r\n\r\n"Indeed, yes; if we could always get bread, it would be too good."\r\n\r\nThe horse had started; the carman, in his turn, disappeared, with the\r\ntrailing step of an invalid. Near the tipping-cradle the workman had\r\nnot stirred, gathered up in a ball, burying his chin between his knees,\r\nwith his great dim eyes fixed on emptiness.\r\n\r\nWhen he had picked up his bundle, \xc3\x89tienne still remained at the same\r\nspot. He felt the gusts freezing his back, while his chest was burning\r\nbefore the large fire. Perhaps, all the same, it would be as well\r\nto inquire at the pit, the old man might not know. Then he resigned\r\nhimself; he would accept any work. Where should he go, and what was to\r\nbecome of him in this country famished for lack of work? Must he leave\r\nhis carcass behind a wall, like a strayed dog? But one doubt troubled\r\nhim, a fear of the Voreux in the middle of this flat plain, drowned in\r\nso thick a night. At every gust the wind seemed to rise as if it blew\r\nfrom an ever-broadening horizon. No dawn whitened the dead sky. The\r\nblast furnaces alone flamed, and the coke ovens, making the darkness\r\nredder without illuminating the unknown. And the Voreux, at the bottom\r\nof its hole, with its posture as of an evil beast, continued to crunch,\r\nbreathing with a heavier and slower respiration, troubled by its\r\npainful digestion of human flesh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the fields of wheat and beetroot, the\r\nDeux-Cent-Quarante settlement slept beneath the black night. One could\r\nvaguely distinguish four immense blocks of small houses, back to back,\r\nbarracks or hospital blocks, geometric and parallel, separated by three\r\nlarge avenues which were divided into gardens of equal size. And over\r\nthe desert plain one heard only the moan of squalls through the broken\r\ntrellises of the enclosures.\r\n\r\nIn the Maheus\' house, No. 16 in the second block, nothing was stirring.\r\nThe single room that occupied the first floor was drowned in a thick\r\ndarkness which seemed to overwhelm with its weight the sleep of the\r\nbeings whom one felt to be there in a mass, with open mouths, overcome\r\nby weariness. In spite of the keen cold outside, there was a living\r\nheat in the heavy air, that hot stuffiness of even the best kept\r\nbedrooms, the smell of human cattle.\r\n\r\nFour o\'clock had struck from the clock in the room on the ground floor,\r\nbut nothing yet stirred; one heard the piping of slender respirations,\r\naccompanied by two series of sonorous snores. And suddenly Catherine\r\ngot up. In her weariness she had, as usual, counted the four strokes\r\nthrough the floor without the strength to arouse herself completely.\r\nThen, throwing her legs from under the bedclothes, she felt about, at\r\nlast struck a match and lighted the candle. But she remained seated,\r\nher head so heavy that it fell back between her shoulders, seeking to\r\nreturn to the bolster.\r\n\r\nNow the candle lighted up the room, a square room with two windows,\r\nand filled with three beds. There could be seen a cupboard, a table,\r\nand two old walnut chairs, whose smoky tone made hard, dark patches\r\nagainst the walls, which were painted a light yellow. And nothing else,\r\nonly clothes hung to nails, a jug placed on the floor, and a red pan\r\nwhich served as a basin. In the bed on the left, Zacharie, the eldest,\r\na youth of one-and-twenty, was asleep with his brother Jeanlin, who\r\nhad completed his eleventh year; in the right-hand bed two urchins,\r\nL\xc3\xa9nore and Henri, the first six years old, the second four, slept in\r\neach other\'s arms, while Catherine shared the third bed with her sister\r\nAlzire, so small for her nine years that Catherine would not have felt\r\nher near her if it were not for the little invalid\'s humpback, which\r\npressed into her side. The glass door was open; one could perceive the\r\nlobby of a landing, a sort of recess in which the father and the mother\r\noccupied a fourth bed, against which they had been obliged to install\r\nthe cradle of the latest comer, Estelle, aged scarcely three months.\r\n\r\nHowever, Catherine made a desperate effort. She stretched herself,\r\nshe fidgeted her two hands in the red hair which covered her forehead\r\nand neck. Slender for her fifteen years, all that showed of her limbs\r\noutside the narrow sheath of her chemise were her bluish feet, as it\r\nwere tattooed with coal, and her slight arms, the milky whiteness of\r\nwhich contrasted with the sallow tint of her face, already spoilt by\r\nconstant washing with black soap. A final yawn opened her rather large\r\nmouth with splendid teeth against the chlorotic pallor of her gums;\r\nwhile her grey eyes were crying in her fight with sleep, with a look of\r\npainful distress and weariness which seemed to spread over the whole of\r\nher naked body.\r\n\r\nBut a growl came from the landing, and Maheu\'s thick voice stammered;\r\n\r\n"Devil take it! It\'s time. Is it you lighting up, Catherine?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, father; it has just struck downstairs."\r\n\r\n"Quick then, lazy. If you had danced less on Sunday you would have woke\r\nus earlier. A fine lazy life!"\r\n\r\nAnd he went on grumbling, but sleep returned to him also. His\r\nreproaches became confused, and were extinguished in fresh snoring.\r\n\r\nThe young girl, in her chemise, with her naked feet on the floor, moved\r\nabout in the room. As she passed by the bed of Henri and L\xc3\xa9nore, she\r\nreplaced the coverlet which had slipped down. They did not wake, lost\r\nin the strong sleep of childhood. Alzire, with open eyes, had turned to\r\ntake the warm place of her big sister without speaking.\r\n\r\n"I say, now, Zacharie--and you, Jeanlin; I say, now!" repeated\r\nCatherine, standing before her two brothers, who were still wallowing\r\nwith their noses in the bolster.\r\n\r\nShe had to seize the elder by the shoulder and shake him; then, while\r\nhe was muttering abuse, it came into her head to uncover them by\r\nsnatching away the sheet. That seemed funny to her, and she began to\r\nlaugh when she saw the two boys struggling with naked legs.\r\n\r\n"Stupid, leave me alone," growled Zacharie in ill-temper, sitting up.\r\n"I don\'t like tricks. Good Lord! Say it\'s time to get up?"\r\n\r\nHe was lean and ill-made, with a long face and a chin which showed\r\nsigns of a sprouting beard, yellow hair, and the anaemic pallor which\r\nbelonged to his whole family.\r\n\r\nHis shirt had rolled up to his belly, and he lowered it, not from\r\nmodesty but because he was not warm.\r\n\r\n"It has struck downstairs," repeated Catherine; "come! up! father\'s\r\nangry."\r\n\r\nJeanlin, who had rolled himself up, closed his eyes, saying: "Go and\r\nhang yourself; I\'m going to sleep."\r\n\r\nShe laughed again, the laugh of a good-natured girl. He was so small,\r\nhis limbs so thin, with enormous joints, enlarged by scrofula, that she\r\ntook him up in her arms. But he kicked about, his apish face, pale and\r\nwrinkled, with its green eyes and great ears, grew pale with the rage\r\nof weakness. He said nothing, he bit her right breast.\r\n\r\n"Beastly fellow!" she murmured, keeping back a cry and putting him on\r\nthe floor.\r\n\r\nAlzire was silent, with the sheet tucked under her chin, but she had\r\nnot gone to sleep again. With her intelligent invalid\'s eyes she\r\nfollowed her sister and her two brothers, who were now dressing.\r\nAnother quarrel broke out around the pan, the boys hustled the young\r\ngirl because she was so long washing herself. Shirts flew about: and,\r\nwhile still half-asleep, they eased themselves without shame, with\r\nthe tranquil satisfaction of a litter of puppies that have grown up\r\ntogether. Catherine was ready first. She put on her miner\'s breeches,\r\nthen her canvas jacket, and fastened the blue cap on her knotted hair;\r\nin these clean Monday clothes she had the appearance of a little man;\r\nnothing remained to indicate her sex except the slight roll of her hips.\r\n\r\n"When the old man comes back," said Zacharie, mischievously, "he\'ll\r\nlike to find the bed unmade. You know I shall tell him it\'s you."\r\n\r\nThe old man was the grandfather, Bonnemort, who, as he worked during\r\nthe night, slept by day, so that the bed was never cold; there was\r\nalways someone snoring there. Without replying, Catherine set herself\r\nto arrange the bed-clothes and tuck them in. But during the last\r\nmoments sounds had been heard behind the wall in the next house. These\r\nbrick buildings, economically put up by the Company, were so thin that\r\nthe least breath could be heard through them. The inmates lived there,\r\nelbow to elbow, from one end to the other; and no fact of family life\r\nremained hidden, even from the youngsters. A heavy step had tramped up\r\nthe staircase; then there was a kind of soft fall, followed by a sigh\r\nof satisfaction.\r\n\r\n"Good!" said Catherine. "Levaque has gone down, and here is Bouteloup\r\ncome to join the Levaque woman."\r\n\r\nJeanlin grinned; even Alzire\'s eyes shone. Every morning they made fun\r\nof the household of three next door, a pikeman who lodged a worker in\r\nthe cutting, an arrangement which gave the woman two men, one by night,\r\nthe other by day.\r\n\r\n"Philom\xc3\xa9ne is coughing," began Catherine again, after listening.\r\n\r\nShe was speaking of the eldest Levaque, a big girl of nineteen, and\r\nthe mistress of Zacharie, by whom she had already had two children;\r\nher chest was so delicate that she was only a sifter at the pit, never\r\nhaving been able to work below.\r\n\r\n"Pooh! Philom\xc3\xa9ne!" replied Zacharie, "she cares a lot, she\'s asleep.\r\nIt\'s hoggish to sleep till six."\r\n\r\nHe was putting on his breeches when an idea occurred to him, and he\r\nopened the window. Outside in the darkness the settlement was awaking,\r\nlights were dawning one by one between the laths of the shutters. And\r\nthere was another dispute: he leant out to watch if he could not see,\r\ncoming out of Pierron\'s opposite, the captain of the Voreux, who was\r\naccused of sleeping with the Pierron woman, while his sister called to\r\nhim that since the day before the husband had taken day duty at the\r\npit-eye, and that certainly Dansaert could not have slept there that\r\nnight. Whilst the air entered in icy whiffs, both of them, becoming\r\nangry, maintained the truth of their own information, until cries and\r\ntears broke out. It was Estelle, in her cradle, vexed by the cold.\r\n\r\nMaheu woke up suddenly. What had he got in his bones, then? Here\r\nhe was going to sleep again like a good-for-nothing. And he swore\r\nso vigorously that the children became still. Zacharie and Jeanlin\r\nfinished washing with slow weariness. Alzire, with her large, open\r\neyes, continually stared. The two youngsters, L\xc3\xa9nore and Henri, in each\r\nother\'s arms, had not stirred, breathing in the same quiet way in spite\r\nof the noise.\r\n\r\n"Catherine, give me the candle," called out Maheu.\r\n\r\nShe finished buttoning her jacket, and carried the candle into the\r\ncloset, leaving her brothers to look for their clothes by what light\r\ncame through the door. Her father jumped out of bed. She did not stop,\r\nbut went downstairs in her coarse woollen stockings, feeling her way,\r\nand lighted another candle in the parlour, to prepare the coffee. All\r\nthe sabots of the family were beneath the sideboard.\r\n\r\n"Will you be still, vermin?" began Maheu, again, exasperated by\r\nEstelle\'s cries which still went on.\r\n\r\nHe was short, like old Bonnemort, and resembled him, with his strong\r\nhead, his flat, livid face, beneath yellow hair cut very short. The\r\nchild screamed more than ever, frightened by those great knotted arms\r\nwhich were held above her.\r\n\r\n"Leave her alone; you know that she won\'t be still," said his wife,\r\nstretching herself in the middle of the bed.\r\n\r\nShe also had just awakened and was complaining how disgusting it was\r\nnever to be able to finish the night. Could they not go away quietly?\r\nBuried in the clothes she only showed her long face with large features\r\nof a heavy beauty, already disfigured at thirty-nine by her life of\r\nwretchedness and the seven children she had borne. With her eyes on\r\nthe ceiling she spoke slowly, while her man dressed himself. They\r\nboth ceased to hear the little one, who was strangling herself with\r\nscreaming.\r\n\r\n"Eh? You know I haven\'t a penny and this is only Monday: still six days\r\nbefore the fortnight\'s out. This can\'t go on. You, all of you, only\r\nbring in nine francs. How do you expect me to go on? We are ten in the\r\nhouse."\r\n\r\n"Oh! nine francs!" exclaimed Maheu. "I and Zacharie three: that makes\r\nsix, Catherine and the father, two: that makes four: four and six, ten,\r\nand Jeanlin one, that makes eleven."\r\n\r\n"Yes, eleven, but there are Sundays and the off-days. Never more than\r\nnine, you know."\r\n\r\nHe did not reply, being occupied in looking on the ground for his\r\nleather belt. Then he said, on getting up:\r\n\r\n"Mustn\'t complain. I am sound all the same. There\'s more than one at\r\nforty-two who are put to the patching."\r\n\r\n"Maybe, old man, but that does not give us bread. Where am I to get it\r\nfrom, eh? Have you got nothing?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got two coppers."\r\n\r\n"Keep them for a half-pint. Good Lord! where am I to get it from? Six\r\ndays! it will never end. We owe sixty francs to Maigrat, who turned me\r\nout of doors day before yesterday. That won\'t prevent me from going to\r\nsee him again. But if he goes on refusing----"\r\n\r\nAnd Maheude continued in her melancholy voice, without moving her head,\r\nonly closing her eyes now and then beneath the dim light of the candle.\r\nShe said the cupboard was empty, the little ones asking for bread and\r\nbutter, even the coffee was done, and the water caused colic, and\r\nthe long days passed in deceiving hunger with boiled cabbage leaves.\r\nLittle by little she had been obliged to raise her voice, for Estelle\'s\r\nscreams drowned her words. These cries became unbearable. Maheu seemed\r\nall at once to hear them, and, in a fury, snatched the little one up\r\nfrom the cradle and threw it on the mother\'s bed, stammering with rage:\r\n\r\n"Here, take her; I\'ll do for her! Damn the child! It wants for nothing:\r\nit sucks, and it complains louder than all the rest!"\r\n\r\nEstelle began, in fact, to suck. Hidden beneath the clothes and soothed\r\nby the warmth of the bed, her cries subsided into the greedy little\r\nsound of her lips.\r\n\r\n"Haven\'t the Piolaine people told you to go and see them?" asked the\r\nfather, after a period of silence.\r\n\r\nThe mother bit her lip with an air of discouraged doubt.\r\n\r\n"Yes, they met me; they were carrying clothes for poor children. Yes,\r\nI\'ll take L\xc3\xa9nore and Henri to them this morning. If they only give me a\r\nfew pence!"\r\n\r\nThere was silence again.\r\n\r\nMaheu was ready. He remained a moment motionless, then added, in his\r\nhollow voice:\r\n\r\n"What is it that you want? Let things be, and see about the soup. It\'s\r\nno good talking, better be at work down below."\r\n\r\n"True enough," replied Maheude. "Blow out the candle: I don\'t need to\r\nsee the colour of my thoughts."\r\n\r\nHe blew out the candle. Zacharie and Jeanlin were already going down;\r\nhe followed them, and the wooden staircase creaked beneath their heavy\r\nfeet, clad in wool. Behind them the closet and the room were again\r\ndark. The children slept; even Alzire\'s eyelids were closed; but the\r\nmother now remained with her eyes open in the darkness, while, pulling\r\nat her breast, the pendent breast of an exhausted woman, Estelle was\r\npurring like a kitten.\r\n\r\nDown below, Catherine had at first occupied herself with the fire,\r\nwhich was burning in the iron grate, flanked by two ovens. The Company\r\ndistributed every month, to each family, eight hectolitres of a hard\r\nslaty coal, gathered in the passages. It burnt slowly, and the young\r\ngirl, who piled up the fire every night, only had to stir it in the\r\nmorning, adding a few fragments of soft coal, carefully picked out.\r\nThen, after having placed a kettle on the grate, she sat down before\r\nthe sideboard.\r\n\r\nIt was a fairly large room, occupying all the ground floor, painted an\r\napple green, and of Flemish cleanliness, with its flags well washed and\r\ncovered with white sand. Besides the sideboard of varnished deal the\r\nfurniture consisted of a table and chairs of the same wood. Stuck on to\r\nthe walls were some violently-coloured prints, portraits of the Emperor\r\nand the Empress, given by the Company, of soldiers and of saints\r\nspeckled with gold, contrasting crudely with the simple nudity of the\r\nroom; and there was no other ornament except a box of rose-coloured\r\npasteboard on the sideboard, and the clock with its daubed face and\r\nloud tick-tack, which seemed to fill the emptiness of the place. Near\r\nthe staircase door another door led to the cellar. In spite of the\r\ncleanliness, an odour of cooked onion, shut up since the night before,\r\npoisoned the hot, heavy air, always laden with an acrid flavour of coal.\r\n\r\nCatherine, in front of the sideboard, was reflecting. There only\r\nremained the end of a loaf, cheese in fair abundance, but hardly a\r\nmorsel of butter; and she had to provide bread and butter for four. At\r\nlast she decided, cut the slices, took one and covered it with cheese,\r\nspread another with butter, and stuck them together; that was the\r\n"brick," the bread-and-butter sandwich taken to the pit every morning.\r\nThe four bricks were soon on the table, in a row, cut with severe\r\njustice, from the big one for the father down to the little one for\r\nJeanlin.\r\n\r\nCatherine, who appeared absorbed in her household duties, must,\r\nhowever, have been thinking of the stories told by Zacharie about the\r\nhead captain and the Pierron woman, for she half opened the front door\r\nand glanced outside. The wind was still whistling. There were numerous\r\nspots of light on the low fronts of the settlement, from which arose a\r\nvague tremor of awakening. Already doors were being closed, and black\r\nfiles of workers passed into the night. It was stupid of her to get\r\ncold, since the porter at the pit-eye was certainly asleep, waiting\r\nto take his duties at six. Yet she remained and looked at the house\r\non the other side of the gardens. The door opened, and her curiosity\r\nwas aroused. But it could only be one of the little Pierrons, Lydie,\r\nsetting out for the pit.\r\n\r\nThe hissing sound of steam made her turn. She shut the door, and\r\nhastened back; the water was boiling over, and putting out the fire.\r\nThere was no more coffee. She had to be content to add the water to\r\nlast night\'s dregs; then she sugared the coffee-pot with brown sugar.\r\nAt that moment her father and two brothers came downstairs.\r\n\r\n"Faith!" exclaimed Zacharie, when he had put his nose into his bowl,\r\n"here\'s something that won\'t get into our heads."\r\n\r\nMaheu shrugged his shoulders with an air of resignation.\r\n\r\n"Bah! It\'s hot! It\'s good all the same."\r\n\r\nJeanlin had gathered up the fragments of bread and made a sop of them.\r\nAfter having drunk, Catherine finished by emptying the coffee-pot into\r\nthe tin-jacks. All four, standing up in the smoky light of the candle,\r\nswallowed their meals hastily.\r\n\r\n"Are we at the end?" said the father; "one would say we were people of\r\nproperty."\r\n\r\nBut a voice came from the staircase, of which they had left the door\r\nopen. It was Maheude, who called out:\r\n\r\n"Take all the bread: I have some vermicelli for the children."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes," replied Catherine.\r\n\r\nShe had piled up the fire, wedging the pot that held the remains of the\r\nsoup into a corner of the grate, so that the grandfather might find\r\nit warm when he came in at six. Each took his sabots from under the\r\nsideboard, passed the strings of his tin over his shoulder and placed\r\nhis brick at his back, between shirt and jacket. And they went out, the\r\nmen first, the girl, who came last, blowing out the candle and turning\r\nthe key. The house became dark again.\r\n\r\n"Ah! we\'re off together," said a man who was closing the door of the\r\nnext house.\r\n\r\nIt was Levaque, with his son B\xc3\xa9bert, an urchin of twelve, a great\r\nfriend of Jeanlin\'s. Catherine, in surprise, stifled a laugh in\r\nZacharie\'s ear:\r\n\r\n"Why! Bouteloup didn\'t even wait until the husband had gone!"\r\n\r\nNow the lights in the settlement were extinguished, and the last door\r\nbanged. All again fell asleep; the women and the little ones resuming\r\ntheir slumber in the midst of wider beds. And from the extinguished\r\nvillage to the roaring Voreux a slow filing of shadows took place\r\nbeneath the squalls, the departure of the colliers to their work,\r\nbending their shoulders and incommoded by their arms, crossed on their\r\nbreasts, while the brick behind formed a hump on each back. Clothed\r\nin their thin jackets they shivered with cold, but without hastening,\r\nstraggling along the road with the tramp of a flock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne had at last descended from the platform and entered the\r\nVoreux; he spoke to men whom he met, asking if there was work to be\r\nhad, but all shook their heads, telling him to wait for the captain.\r\nThey left him free to roam through the ill-lighted buildings, full of\r\nblack holes, confusing with their complicated stories and rooms. After\r\nhaving mounted a dark and half-destroyed staircase, he found himself\r\non a shaky foot-bridge; then he crossed the screening-shed, which\r\nwas plunged in such profound darkness that he walked with his hands\r\nbefore him for protection. Suddenly two enormous yellow eyes pierced\r\nthe darkness in front of him. He was beneath the pit-frame in the\r\nreceiving-room, at the very mouth of the shaft.\r\n\r\nA captain, Father Richomme, a big man with the face of a good-natured\r\ngendarme, and with a straight grey moustache, was at that moment going\r\ntowards the receiver\'s office.\r\n\r\n"Do they want a hand here for any kind of work?" asked \xc3\x89tienne again.\r\n\r\nRichomme was about to say no, but he changed his mind and replied like\r\nthe others, as he went away:\r\n\r\n"Wait for Monsieur Dansaert, the head captain."\r\n\r\nFour lanterns were placed there, and the reflectors which threw all\r\nthe light on to the shaft vividly illuminated the iron rail, the\r\nlevers of the signals and bars, the joists of the guides along which\r\nslid the two cages. The rest of the vast room, like the nave of a\r\nchurch, was obscure, and peopled by great floating shadows. Only the\r\nlamp-cabin shone at the far end, while in the receiver\'s office a small\r\nlamp looked like a fading star. Work was about to be resumed, and on\r\nthe iron pavement there was a continual thunder, trams of coal being\r\nwheeled without ceasing, while the landers, with their long, bent\r\nbacks, could be distinguished amid the movement of all these black and\r\nnoisy things, in perpetual agitation.\r\n\r\nFor a moment \xc3\x89tienne stood motionless, deafened and blinded. He felt\r\nfrozen by the currents of air which entered from every side. Then he\r\nmoved on a few paces, attracted by the winding engine, of which he\r\ncould now see the glistening steel and copper. It was twenty-five\r\nmetres beyond the shaft, in a loftier chamber, and placed so solidly on\r\nits brick foundation that though it worked at full speed, with all its\r\nfour hundred horse power, the movement of its enormous crank, emerging\r\nand plunging with oily softness, imparted no quiver to the walls.\r\nThe engine-man, standing at his post, listened to the ringing of the\r\nsignals, and his eye never moved from the indicator where the shaft\r\nwas figured, with its different levels, by a vertical groove traversed\r\nby shot hanging to strings, which represented the cages; and at each\r\ndeparture, when the machine was put in motion, the drums--two immense\r\nwheels, five metres in radius, by means of which the two steel cables\r\nwere rolled and unrolled--turned with such rapidity that they became\r\nlike grey powder.\r\n\r\n"Look out, there!" cried three landers, who were dragging an immense\r\nladder.\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne just escaped being crushed; his eyes were soon more at home,\r\nand he watched the cables moving in the air, more than thirty metres\r\nof steel ribbon, which flew up into the pit-frame where they passed\r\nover pulleys to descend perpendicularly into the shaft, where they\r\nwere attached to the cages. An iron frame, like the high scaffolding\r\nof a belfry, supported the pulleys. It was like the gliding of a bird,\r\nnoiseless, without a jar, this rapid flight, the continual come and\r\ngo of a thread of enormous weight, capable of lifting twelve thousand\r\nkilograms at the rate of ten metres a second.\r\n\r\n"Attention there, for God\'s sake!" cried again the landers, pushing\r\nthe ladder to the other side in order to climb to the left-hand rowel.\r\nSlowly \xc3\x89tienne returned to the receiving-room. This giant flight over\r\nhis head took away his breath. Shivering in the currents of air, he\r\nwatched the movement of the cages, his ears deafened by the rumblings\r\nof the trams. Near the shaft the signal was working, a heavy-levered\r\nhammer drawn by a cord from below and allowed to strike against a\r\nblock. One blow to stop, two to go down, three to go up; it was\r\nunceasing, like blows of a club dominating the tumult, accompanied by\r\nthe clear sound of the bell; while the lander, directing the work,\r\nincreased the noise still more by shouting orders to the engine-man\r\nthrough a trumpet. The cages in the middle of the clear space appeared\r\nand disappeared, were filled and emptied, without \xc3\x89tienne being at all\r\nable to understand the complicated proceeding.\r\n\r\nHe only understood one thing well: the shaft swallowed men by mouthfuls\r\nof twenty or thirty, and with so easy a gulp that it seemed to feel\r\nnothing go down. Since four o\'clock the descent of the workmen had\r\nbeen going on. They came to the shed with naked feet and their lamps\r\nin their hands, waiting in little groups until a sufficient number had\r\narrived. Without a sound, with the soft bound of a nocturnal beast,\r\nthe iron cage arose from the night, wedged itself on the bolts with\r\nits four decks, each containing two trams full of coal. Landers on\r\ndifferent platforms took out the trams and replaced them by others,\r\neither empty or already laden with trimmed wooden props; and it was\r\ninto the empty trams that the workmen crowded, five at a time, up to\r\nforty. When they filled all the compartments, an order came from the\r\ntrumpet--a hollow indistinct roar--while the signal cord was pulled\r\nfour times from below, "ringing meat," to give warning of this burden\r\nof human flesh. Then, after a slight leap, the cage plunged silently,\r\nfalling like a stone, only leaving behind it the vibrating flight of a\r\ncable.\r\n\r\n"Is it deep?" asked \xc3\x89tienne of a miner, who waited near him with a\r\nsleepy air.\r\n\r\n"Five hundred and fifty-four metres," replied the man. "But there are\r\nfour levels, the first at three hundred and twenty." Both were silent,\r\nwith their eyes on the returning cable. \xc3\x89tienne said again:\r\n\r\n"And if it breaks?"\r\n\r\n"Ah! if it breaks----"\r\n\r\nThe miner ended with a gesture. His turn had arrived; the cage had\r\nreappeared with its easy, unfatigued movement. He squatted in it with\r\nsome comrades; it plunged down, then flew up again in less then four\r\nminutes to swallow down another load of men. For half an hour the shaft\r\nwent on devouring in this fashion, with more or less greedy gulps,\r\naccording to the depth of the level to which the men went down, but\r\nwithout stopping, always hungry, with its giant intestines capable\r\nof digesting a nation. It went on filling and still filling, and the\r\ndarkness remained dead. The cage mounted from the void with the same\r\nvoracious silence.\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne was at last seized again by the same depression which he had\r\nexperienced on the pit bank. What was the good of persisting? This\r\nhead captain would send him off like the others. A vague fear suddenly\r\ndecided him: he went away, only stopping before the building of the\r\nengine room. The wide-open door showed seven boilers with two furnaces.\r\nIn the midst of the white steam and the whistling of the escapes a\r\nstoker was occupied in piling up one of the furnaces, the heat of\r\nwhich could be felt as far as the threshold; and the young man was\r\napproaching, glad of the warmth, when he met a new band of colliers who\r\nhad just arrived at the pit. It was the Maheu and Levaque set. When he\r\nsaw Catherine at the head, with her gentle boyish air, a superstitious\r\nidea caused him to risk another question.\r\n\r\n"I say there, mate! do they want a hand here for any kind of work?"\r\n\r\nShe looked at him surprised, rather frightened at this sudden voice\r\ncoming out of the shadow. But Maheu, behind her, had heard and replied,\r\ntalking with \xc3\x89tienne for a moment. No, no one was wanted. This poor\r\ndevil of a man who had lost his way here interested him. When he left\r\nhim he said to the others:\r\n\r\n"Eh! one might easily be like that. Mustn\'t complain: every one hasn\'t\r\nthe chance to work himself to death."\r\n\r\nThe band entered and went straight to the shed, a vast hall roughly\r\nboarded and surrounded by cupboards shut by padlocks. In the centre an\r\niron fireplace, a sort of closed stove without a door, glowed red and\r\nwas so stuffed with burning coal that fragments flew out and rolled\r\non to the trodden soil. The hall was only lighted by this stove,\r\nfrom which sanguine reflections danced along the greasy woodwork up\r\nto the ceiling, stained with black dust. As the Maheus went into the\r\nheat there was a sound of laughter. Some thirty workmen were standing\r\nupright with their backs to the fire, roasting themselves with an air\r\nof enjoyment. Before going down, they all came here to get a little\r\nwarmth in their skins, so that they could face the dampness of the\r\npit. But this morning there was much amusement: they were joking\r\nMouquette, a putter girl of eighteen, whose enormous breasts and\r\nflanks were bursting through her old jacket and breeches. She lived\r\nat R\xc3\xa9quillart with her father old Mouque, a groom, and Mouquet, her\r\nbrother, a lander; but their hours of work were not the same; she went\r\nto the pit by herself, and in the middle of the wheatfields in summer,\r\nor against a wall in winter, she took her pleasure with her lover of\r\nthe week. All in the mine had their turn; it was a perpetual round of\r\ncomrades without further consequences. One day, when reproached about\r\na Marchiennes nail-maker, she was furiously angry, exclaiming that she\r\nrespected herself far too much, that she would cut her arm off if any\r\none could boast that he had seen her with any one but a collier.\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t that big Chaval now?" said a miner grinning; "did that\r\nlittle fellow have you? he must have needed a ladder. I saw you behind\r\nR\xc3\xa9quillart, a token that he got up on a milestone."\r\n\r\n"Well," replied Mouquette, in a good humour, "what\'s that to do with\r\nyou? You were not asked to push."\r\n\r\nAnd this gross good-natured joke increased the laughter of the men, who\r\nexpanded their shoulders, half cooked by the stove, while she herself,\r\nshaken by laughter, was displaying in the midst of them the indecency\r\nof her costume, embarrassingly comical, with her masses of flesh\r\nexaggerated almost to disease.\r\n\r\nBut the gaiety ceased; Mouquette told Maheu that Fleurance, big\r\nFleurance, would never come again; she had been found the night before\r\nstiff in her bed; some said it was her heart, others that it was a pint\r\nof gin she had drunk too quickly. And Maheu was in despair; another\r\npiece of ill-luck; one of the best of his putters gone without any\r\nchance of replacing her at once. He was working in a set; there were\r\nfour pikemen associated in his cutting, himself, Zacharie, Levaque, and\r\nChaval. If they had Catherine alone to wheel, the work would suffer.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he called out:\r\n\r\n"I have it! there was that man looking for work!"\r\n\r\nAt that moment Dansaert passed before the shed. Maheu told him the\r\nstory, and asked for his authority to engage the man; he emphasized the\r\ndesire of the Company to substitute men for women, as at Anzin. The\r\nhead captain smiled at first; for the scheme of excluding women from\r\nthe pit was not usually well received by the miners, who were troubled\r\nabout placing their daughters, and not much affected by questions of\r\nmorality and health. But after some hesitation he gave his permission,\r\nreserving its ratification for Monsieur N\xc3\xa9grel, the engineer.\r\n\r\n"All very well!" exclaimed Zacharie; "the man must be away by this\r\ntime."\r\n\r\n"No," said Catherine. "I saw him stop at the boilers."\r\n\r\n"After him, then, lazy," cried Maheu.\r\n\r\nThe young girl ran forward; while a crowd of miners proceeded to the\r\nshaft, yielding the fire to others.\r\n\r\nJeanlin, without waiting for his father, went also to take his lamp,\r\ntogether with B\xc3\xa9bert, a big, stupid boy, and Lydie, a small child of\r\nten. Mouquette, who was in front of them, called out in the black\r\npassage they were dirty brats, and threatened to box their ears if they\r\npinched her.\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne was, in fact, in the boiler building, talking with a stoker,\r\nwho was charging the furnaces with coal. He felt very cold at the\r\nthought of the night into which he must return. But he was deciding to\r\nset out, when he felt a hand placed on his shoulder.\r\n\r\n"Come," said Catherine; "there\'s something for you."\r\n\r\nAt first he could not understand. Then he felt a spasm of joy, and\r\nvigorously squeezed the young girl\'s hands.\r\n\r\n"Thanks, mate. Ah! you\'re a good chap, you are!"\r\n\r\nShe began to laugh, looking at him in the red light of the furnaces,\r\nwhich lit them up. It amused her that he should take her for a boy,\r\nstill slender, with her knot of hair hidden beneath the cap. He also\r\nwas laughing, with satisfaction, and they remained, for a moment, both\r\nlaughing in each other\'s faces with radiant cheeks.\r\n\r\nMaheu, squatting down before his box in the shed, was taking off\r\nhis sabots and his coarse woollen stockings. When \xc3\x89tienne arrived\r\neverything was settled in three or four words: thirty sous a day,\r\nhard work, but work that he would easily learn. The pikeman advised\r\nhim to keep his shoes, and lent him an old cap, a leather hat for the\r\nprotection of his skull, a precaution which the father and his children\r\ndisdained. The tools were taken out of the chest, where also was found\r\nFleurance\'s shovel. Then, when Maheu had shut up their sabots, their\r\nstockings, as well as \xc3\x89tienne\'s bundle, he suddenly became impatient.\r\n\r\n"What is that lazy Chaval up to? Another girl given a tumble on a pile\r\nof stones? We are half an hour late to-day."\r\n\r\nZacharie and Levaque were quietly roasting their shoulders. The former\r\nsaid at last:\r\n\r\n"Is it Chaval you\'re waiting for? He came before us, and went down at\r\nonce."\r\n\r\n"What! you knew that, and said nothing? Come, come, look sharp!"\r\n\r\nCatherine, who was warming her hands, had to follow the band. \xc3\x89tienne\r\nallowed her to pass, and went behind her. Again he journeyed through\r\na maze of staircases and obscure corridors in which their naked feet\r\nproduced the soft sound of old slippers. But the lamp-cabin was\r\nglittering--a glass house, full of hooks in rows, holding hundreds of\r\nDavy lamps, examined and washed the night before, and lighted like\r\ncandles in a mortuary chapel. At the barrier each workman took his own,\r\nstamped with his number; then he examined it and shut it himself, while\r\nthe marker, seated at a table, inscribed on the registers the hour of\r\ndescent. Maheu had to intervene to obtain a lamp for his new putter,\r\nand there was still another precaution: the workers defiled before an\r\nexaminer, who assured himself that all the lamps were properly closed.\r\n\r\n"Golly! It\'s not warm here," murmured Catherine, shivering.\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne contented himself with nodding his head. He was in front of\r\nthe shaft, in the midst of a vast hall swept by currents of air.\r\nHe certainly considered himself brave, but he felt a disagreeable\r\nemotion at his chest amid this thunder of trams, the hollow blows of\r\nthe signals, the stifled howling of the trumpet, the continual flight\r\nof those cables, unrolled and rolled at full speed by the drums of\r\nthe engine. The cages rose and sank with the gliding movement of a\r\nnocturnal beast, always engulfing men, whom the throat of the hole\r\nseemed to drink. It was his turn now. He felt very cold, and preserved\r\na nervous silence which made Zacharie and Levaque grin; for both of\r\nthem disapproved of the hiring of this unknown man, especially Levaque,\r\nwho was offended that he had not been consulted. So Catherine was glad\r\nto hear her father explain things to the young man.\r\n\r\n"Look! above the cage there is a parachute with iron grapnels to catch\r\ninto the guides in case of breakage. Does it work? Oh, not always. Yes,\r\nthe shaft is divided into three compartments, closed by planking from\r\ntop to bottom; in the middle the cages, on the left the passage for the\r\nladders----"\r\n\r\nBut he interrupted himself to grumble, though taking care not to raise\r\nhis voice much.\r\n\r\n"What are we stuck here for, blast it? What right have they to freeze\r\nus in this way?"\r\n\r\nThe captain, Richomme, who was going down himself, with his naked lamp\r\nfixed by a nail into the leather of his cap, heard him.\r\n\r\n"Careful! Look out for ears," he murmured paternally, as an old miner\r\nwith a affectionate feeling for comrades. "Workmen must do what they\r\ncan. Hold on! here we are; get in with your fellows."\r\n\r\nThe cage, provided with iron bands and a small-meshed lattice work,\r\nwas in fact awaiting them on the bars. Maheu, Zacharie, and Catherine\r\nslid into a tram below, and as all five had to enter, \xc3\x89tienne in\r\nhis turn went in, but the good places were taken; he had to squeeze\r\nhimself near the young girl, whose elbow pressed into his belly. His\r\nlamp embarrassed him; they advised him to fasten it to the button-hole\r\nof his jacket. Not hearing, he awkwardly kept it in his hand. The\r\nembarkation continued, above and below, a confused packing of cattle.\r\nThey did not, however, set out. What, then, was happening? It seemed\r\nto him that his impatience lasted for many minutes. At last he felt a\r\nshock, and the light grew dim, everything around him seemed to fly,\r\nwhile he experienced the dizzy anxiety of a fall contracting his\r\nbowels. This lasted as long as he could see light, through the two\r\nreception stories, in the midst of the whirling by of the scaffolding.\r\nThen, having fallen into the blackness of the pit, he became stunned,\r\nno longer having any clear perception of his sensations.\r\n\r\n"Now we are off," said Maheu quietly.\r\n\r\nThey were all at their ease. He asked himself at times if he was going\r\nup or down. Now and then, when the cage went straight without touching\r\nthe guides, there seemed to be no motion, but rough shocks were\r\nafterwards produced, a sort of dancing amid the joists, which made him\r\nfear a catastrophe. For the rest he could not distinguish the walls of\r\nthe shaft behind the lattice work, to which he pressed his face. The\r\nlamps feebly lighted the mass of bodies at his feet. Only the captain\'s\r\nnaked light, in the neighbouring tram, shone like a lighthouse.\r\n\r\n"This is four metres in diameter," continued Maheu, to instruct him.\r\n"The tubbing wants doing over again, for the water comes in everywhere.\r\nStop! we are reaching the bottom: do you hear?"\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne was, in fact, now asking himself the meaning of this noise of\r\nfalling rain. A few large drops had at first sounded on the roof of\r\nthe cage, like the beginning of a shower, and now the rain increased,\r\nstreaming down, becoming at last a deluge. The roof must be full of\r\nholes, for a thread of water was flowing on to his shoulder and wetting\r\nhim to the skin. The cold became icy and they were buried in black\r\nhumidity, when they passed through a sudden flash of light, the vision\r\nof a cavern in which men were moving. But already they had fallen back\r\ninto darkness.\r\n\r\nMaheu said:\r\n\r\n"That is the first main level. We are at three hundred and twenty\r\nmetres. See the speed."\r\n\r\nRaising his lamp he lighted up a joist of the guides which fled by like\r\na rail beneath a train going at full speed; and beyond, as before,\r\nnothing could be seen. They passed three other levels in flashes of\r\nlight. The deafening rain continued to strike through the darkness.\r\n\r\n"How deep it is!" murmured \xc3\x89tienne.\r\n\r\nThis fall seemed to last for hours. He was suffering for the cramped\r\nposition he had taken, not daring to move, and especially tortured by\r\nCatherine\'s elbow. She did not speak a word; he only felt her against\r\nhim and it warmed him. When the cage at last stopped at the bottom, at\r\nfive hundred and fifty-four metres, he was astonished to learn that\r\nthe descent had lasted exactly one minute. But the noise of the bolts\r\nfixing themselves, the sensation of solidity beneath, suddenly cheered\r\nhim; and he was joking when he said to Catherine:\r\n\r\n"What have you got under your skin to be so warm? I\'ve got your elbow\r\nin my belly, sure enough."\r\n\r\nThen she also burst out laughing. Stupid of him, still to take her for\r\na boy! Were his eyes out?\r\n\r\n"It\'s in your eye that you\'ve got my elbow!" she replied, in the midst\r\nof a storm of laughter which the astonished young man could not account\r\nfor.\r\n\r\nThe cage voided its burden of workers, who crossed the pit-eye hall, a\r\nchamber cut in the rock, vaulted with masonry, and lighted up by three\r\nlarge lamps. Over the iron flooring the porters were violently rolling\r\nladen trams. A cavernous odour exhaled from the walls, a freshness of\r\nsaltpetre in which mingled hot breaths from the neighbouring stable.\r\nThe openings of four galleries yawned here.\r\n\r\n"This way," said Maheu to \xc3\x89tienne. "You\'re not there yet. It is still\r\ntwo kilometres."\r\n\r\nThe workmen separated, and were lost in groups in the depths of these\r\nblack holes. Some fifteen went off into that on the left, and \xc3\x89tienne\r\nwalked last, behind Maheu, who was preceded by Catherine, Zacharie,\r\nand Levaque. It was a large gallery for wagons, through a bed of solid\r\nrock, which had only needed walling here and there. In single file they\r\nstill went on without a word, by the tiny flame of the lamps. The young\r\nman stumbled at every step, and entangled his feet in the rails. For a\r\nmoment a hollow sound disturbed him, the sound of a distant storm, the\r\nviolence of which seemed to increase and to come from the bowels of the\r\nearth. Was it the thunder of a landslip bringing on to their heads the\r\nenormous mass which separated them from the light? A gleam pierced the\r\nnight, he felt the rock tremble, and when he had placed himself close\r\nto the wall, like his comrades, he saw a large white horse close to his\r\nface, harnessed to a train of wagons. On the first, and holding the\r\nreins, was seated B\xc3\xa9bert, while Jeanlin, with his hands leaning on the\r\nedge of the last, was running barefooted behind.\r\n\r\nThey again began their walk. Farther on they reached crossways, where\r\ntwo new galleries opened, and the band divided again, the workers\r\ngradually entering all the stalls of the mine.\r\n\r\nNow the wagon-gallery was constructed of wood; props of timber\r\nsupported the roof, and made for the crumbly rock a screen of\r\nscaffolding, behind which one could see the plates of schist glimmering\r\nwith mica, and the coarse masses of dull, rough sandstone. Trains of\r\ntubs, full or empty, continually passed, crossing each other with\r\ntheir thunder, borne into the shadow by vague beasts trotting by like\r\nphantoms. On the double way of a shunting line a long, black serpent\r\nslept, a train at standstill, with a snorting horse, whose crupper\r\nlooked like a block fallen from the roof. Doors for ventilation were\r\nslowly opening and shutting. And as they advanced the gallery became\r\nmore narrow and lower, and the roof irregular, forcing them to bend\r\ntheir backs constantly.\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne struck his head hard; without his leather cap he would have\r\nbroken his skull. However, he attentively followed the slightest\r\ngestures of Maheu, whose sombre profile was seen against the glimmer of\r\nthe lamps. None of the workmen knocked themselves; they evidently knew\r\neach boss, each knot of wood or swelling in the rock. The young man\r\nalso suffered from the slippery soil, which became damper and damper.\r\nAt times he went through actual puddles, only revealed by the muddy\r\nsplash of his feet. But what especially astonished him were the sudden\r\nchanges of temperature. At the bottom of the shaft it was very chilly,\r\nand in the wagon-gallery, through which all the air of the mine passed,\r\nan icy breeze was blowing, with the violence of a tempest, between the\r\nnarrow walls. Afterwards, as they penetrated more deeply along other\r\npassages which only received a meagre share of air, the wind fell and\r\nthe heat increased, a suffocating heat as heavy as lead.\r\n\r\nMaheu had not again opened his mouth. He turned down another gallery to\r\nthe right, simply saying to \xc3\x89tienne, without looking round:\r\n\r\n"The Guillaume seam."\r\n\r\nIt was the seam which contained their cutting. At the first step,\r\n\xc3\x89tienne hurt his head and elbows. The sloping roof descended so low\r\nthat, for twenty or thirty metres at a time, he had to walk bent\r\ndouble. The water came up to his ankles. After two hundred metres of\r\nthis, he saw Levaque, Zacharie, and Catherine disappear, as though they\r\nhad flown through a narrow fissure which was open in front of him.\r\n\r\n"We must climb," said Maheu. "Fasten your lamp to a button-hole and\r\nhang on to the wood." He himself disappeared, and \xc3\x89tienne had to follow\r\nhim. This chimney-passage left in the seam was reserved for miners, and\r\nled to all the secondary passages. It was about the thickness of the\r\ncoal-bed, hardly sixty centimetres. Fortunately the young man was thin,\r\nfor, as he was still awkward, he hoisted himself up with a useless\r\nexpense of muscle, flattening his shoulders and hips, advancing by the\r\nstrength of his wrists, clinging to the planks. Fifteen metres higher\r\nthey came on the first secondary passage, but they had to continue, as\r\nthe cutting of Maheu and his mates was in the sixth passage, in hell,\r\nas they said; every fifteen metres the passages were placed over each\r\nother in never-ending succession through this cleft, which scraped back\r\nand chest. \xc3\x89tienne groaned as if the weight of the rocks had pounded\r\nhis limbs; with torn hands and bruised legs, he also suffered from\r\nlack of air, so that he seemed to feel the blood bursting through his\r\nskin. He vaguely saw in one passage two squatting beasts, a big one\r\nand a little one, pushing trams: they were Lydie and Mouquette already\r\nat work. And he had still to climb the height of two cuttings! He was\r\nblinded by sweat, and he despaired of catching up the others, whose\r\nagile limbs he heard brushing against the rock with a long gliding\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\n"Cheer up! here we are!" said Catherine\'s voice.\r\n\r\nHe had, in fact, arrived, and another voice cried from the bottom of\r\nthe cutting:\r\n\r\n"Well, is this the way to treat people? I have two kilometres to walk\r\nfrom Montsou and I am here first." It was Chaval, a tall, lean, bony\r\nfellow of twenty-five, with strongly marked features, who was in a\r\nbad humour at having to wait. When he saw \xc3\x89tienne he asked, with\r\ncontemptuous surprise:\r\n\r\n"What\'s that?"\r\n\r\nAnd when Maheu had told him the story he added between his teeth:\r\n\r\n"These men are eating the bread of girls."\r\n\r\nThe two men exchanged a look, lighted up by one of those instinctive\r\nhatreds which suddenly flame up. \xc3\x89tienne had felt the insult without\r\nyet understanding it. There was silence, and they got to work. At last\r\nall the seams were gradually filled, and the cuttings were in movement\r\nat every level and at the end of every passage. The devouring shaft\r\nhad swallowed its daily ration of men: nearly seven hundred hands, who\r\nwere now at work in this giant ant-hill, everywhere making holes in the\r\nearth, drilling it like an old worm-eaten piece of wood. And in the\r\nmiddle of the heavy silence and crushing weight of the strata one could\r\nhear, by placing one\'s ear to the rock, the movement of these human\r\ninsects at work, from the flight of the cable which moved the cage up\r\nand down, to the biting of the tools cutting out the coal at the end\r\nof the stalls. \xc3\x89tienne, on turning round, found himself again pressed\r\nclose to Catherine. But this time he caught a glimpse of the developing\r\ncurves of her breast: he suddenly understood the warmth which had\r\npenetrated him.\r\n\r\n"You are a girl, then!" he exclaimed, stupefied.\r\n\r\nShe replied in her cheerful way, without blushing:\r\n\r\n"Of course. You\'ve taken your time to find it out!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe four pikemen had spread themselves one above the other over the\r\nwhole face of the cutting. Separated by planks, hooked on to retain the\r\nfallen coal, they each occupied about four metres of the seam, and this\r\nseam was so thin, scarcely more than fifty centimetres thick at this\r\nspot, that they seemed to be flattened between the roof and the wall,\r\ndragging themselves along by their knees and elbows, and unable to turn\r\nwithout crushing their shoulders. In order to attack the coal, they\r\nhad to lie on their sides with their necks twisted and arms raised,\r\nbrandishing, in a sloping direction, their short-handled picks.\r\n\r\nBelow there was, first, Zacharie; Levaque and Chaval were on the\r\nstages above, and at the very top was Maheu. Each worked at the\r\nslaty bed, which he dug out with blows of the pick; then he made\r\ntwo vertical cuttings in the bed and detached the block by burying\r\nan iron wedge in its upper part. The coal was rich; the block broke\r\nand rolled in fragments along their bellies and thighs. When these\r\nfragments, retained by the plank, had collected round them, the pikemen\r\ndisappeared, buried in the narrow cleft.\r\n\r\nMaheu suffered most. At the top the temperature rose to thirty-five\r\ndegrees, and the air was stagnant, so that in the long run it became\r\nlethal. In order to see, he had been obliged to fix his lamp to a\r\nnail near his head, and this lamp, close to his skull, still further\r\nheated his blood. But his torment was especially aggravated by the\r\nmoisture. The rock above him, a few centimetres from his face, streamed\r\nwith water, which fell in large continuous rapid drops with a sort\r\nof obstinate rhythm, always at the same spot. It was vain for him to\r\ntwist his head or bend back his neck. They fell on his face, dropping\r\nunceasingly. In a quarter of an hour he was soaked, and at the same\r\ntime covered with sweat, smoking as with the hot steam of a laundry.\r\nThis morning a drop beating upon his eye made him swear. He would not\r\nleave his picking, he dealt great strokes which shook him violently\r\nbetween the two rocks, like a fly caught between two leaves of a book\r\nand in danger of being completely flattened.\r\n\r\nNot a word was exchanged. They all hammered; one only heard these\r\nirregular blows, which seemed veiled and remote. The sounds had a\r\nsonorous hoarseness, without any echo in the dead air. And it seemed\r\nthat the darkness was an unknown blackness, thickened by the floating\r\ncoal dust, made heavy by the gas which weighed on the eyes. The wicks\r\nof the lamps beneath their caps of metallic tissue only showed as\r\nreddish points. One could distinguish nothing. The cutting opened out\r\nabove like a large chimney, flat and oblique, in which the soot of ten\r\nyears had amassed a profound night. Spectral figures were moving in it,\r\nthe gleams of light enabled one to catch a glimpse of a rounded hip, a\r\nknotty arm, a vigorous head, besmeared as if for a crime. Sometimes,\r\nblocks of coal shone suddenly as they became detached, illuminated by\r\na crystalline reflection. Then everything fell back into darkness,\r\npickaxes struck great hollow blows; one only heard panting chests, the\r\ngrunting of discomfort and weariness beneath the weight of the air and\r\nthe rain of the springs.\r\n\r\nZacharie, with arms weakened by a spree of the night before, soon\r\nleft his work on the pretence that more timbering was necessary. This\r\nallowed him to forget himself in quiet whistling, his eyes vaguely\r\nresting in the shade. Behind the pikemen nearly three metres of\r\nthe seam were clear, and they had not yet taken the precaution of\r\nsupporting the rock, having grown careless of danger and miserly of\r\ntheir time.\r\n\r\n"Here, you swell," cried the young man to \xc3\x89tienne, "hand up some wood."\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne, who was learning from Catherine how to manage his shovel, had\r\nto raise the wood in the cutting. A small supply had remained over from\r\nyesterday. It was usually sent down every morning ready cut to fit the\r\nbed.\r\n\r\n"Hurry up there, damn it!" shouted Zacharie, seeing the new putter\r\nhoist himself up awkwardly in the midst of the coal, his arms\r\nembarrassed by four pieces of oak.\r\n\r\nHe made a hole in the roof with his pickaxe, and then another in the\r\nwall, and wedged in the two ends of the wood, which thus supported\r\nthe rock. In the afternoon the workers in the earth cutting took the\r\nrubbish left at the bottom of the gallery by the pikemen, and cleared\r\nout the exhausted section of the seam, in which they destroyed the\r\nwood, being only careful about the lower and upper roads for the\r\nhaulage.\r\n\r\nMaheu ceased to groan. At last he had detached his block, and he wiped\r\nhis streaming face on his sleeve. He was worried about what Zacharie\r\nwas doing behind him.\r\n\r\n"Let it be," he said, "we will see after breakfast. Better go on\r\nhewing, if we want to make up our share of trams."\r\n\r\n"It\'s because it\'s sinking," replied the young man. "Look, there\'s a\r\ncrack. It may slip."\r\n\r\nBut the father shrugged his shoulders. Ah! nonsense! Slip! And if it\r\ndid, it would not be the first time; they would get out of it all\r\nright. He grew angry at last, and sent his son to the front of the\r\ncutting.\r\n\r\nAll of them, however, were now stretching themselves. Levaque, resting\r\non his back, was swearing as he examined his left thumb which had been\r\ngrazed by the fall of a piece of sandstone. Chaval had taken off his\r\nshirt in a fury, and was working with bare chest and back for the sake\r\nof coolness. They were already black with coal, soaked in a fine dust\r\ndiluted with sweat which ran down in streams and pools. Maheu first\r\nbegan again to hammer, lower down, with his head level with the rock.\r\nNow the drop struck his forehead so obstinately that he seemed to feel\r\nit piercing a hole in the bone of his skull.\r\n\r\n"You mustn\'t mind," explained Catherine to \xc3\x89tienne, "they are always\r\nhowling."\r\n\r\nAnd like a good-natured girl she went on with her lesson. Every laden\r\ntram arrived at the top in the same condition as it left the cutting,\r\nmarked with a special metal token so that the receiver might put it to\r\nthe reckoning of the stall. It was necessary, therefore, to be very\r\ncareful to fill it, and only to take clean coal, otherwise it was\r\nrefused at the receiving office.\r\n\r\nThe young man, whose eyes were now becoming accustomed to the darkness,\r\nlooked at her, still white with her chlorotic complexion, and he could\r\nnot have told her age; he thought she must be twelve, she seemed to him\r\nso slight. However, he felt she must be older, with her boyish freedom,\r\na simple audacity which confused him a little; she did not please him:\r\nhe thought her too roguish with her pale Pierrot head, framed at the\r\ntemples by the cap. But what astonished him was the strength of this\r\nchild, a nervous strength which was blended with a good deal of skill.\r\nShe filled her tram faster than he could, with quick small regular\r\nstrokes of the shovel; she afterwards pushed it to the inclined way\r\nwith a single slow push, without a hitch, easily passing under the low\r\nrocks. He tore himself to pieces, got off the rails, and was reduced to\r\ndespair.\r\n\r\nIt was certainly not a convenient road. It was sixty metres from the\r\ncutting to the upbrow, and the passage, which the miners in the earth\r\ncutting had not yet enlarged, was a mere tube with a very irregular\r\nroof swollen by innumerable bosses; at certain spots the laden tram\r\ncould only just pass; the putter had to flatten himself, to push on his\r\nknees, in order not to break his head, and besides this the wood was\r\nalready bending and yielding. One could see it broken in the middle in\r\nlong pale rents like an over-weak crutch. One had to be careful not to\r\ngraze oneself in these fractures; and beneath the slow crushing, which\r\ncaused the splitting of billets of oak as large as the thigh, one had\r\nto glide almost on one\'s belly with a secret fear of suddenly hearing\r\none\'s back break.\r\n\r\n"Again!" said Catherine, laughing.\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne\'s tram had gone off the rails at the most difficult spot. He\r\ncould not roll straight on these rails which sank in the damp earth,\r\nand he swore, became angry, and fought furiously with the wheels, which\r\nhe could not get back into place in spite of exaggerated efforts.\r\n\r\n"Wait a bit," said the young girl. "If you get angry it will never\r\ngo." Skilfully she had glided down and thrust her buttocks beneath the\r\ntram, and by putting the weight on her loins she raised it and replaced\r\nit. The weight was seven hundred kilograms. Surprised and ashamed, he\r\nstammered excuses.\r\n\r\nShe was obliged to show him how to straddle his legs and brace his feet\r\nagainst the planking on both sides of the gallery, in order to give\r\nhimself a more solid fulcrum. The body had to be bent, the arms made\r\nstiff so as to push with all the muscles of the shoulders and hips.\r\nDuring the journey he followed her and watched her proceed with tense\r\nback, her fists so low that she seemed trotting on all fours, like one\r\nof those dwarf beasts that perform at circuses. She sweated, panted,\r\nher joints cracked, but without a complaint, with the indifference of\r\ncustom, as if it were the common wretchedness of all to live thus bent\r\ndouble. But he could not succeed in doing as much; his shoes troubled\r\nhim, his body seemed broken by walking in this way with lowered\r\nhead. At the end of a few minutes the position became a torture, an\r\nintolerable anguish, so painful that he got on his knees for a moment\r\nto straighten himself and breathe.\r\n\r\nThen at the upbrow there was more labour. She taught him to fill his\r\ntram quickly. At the top and bottom of this inclined plane, which\r\nserved all the cuttings from one level to the other, there was a\r\ntrammer--the brakesman above, the receiver below. These scamps of\r\ntwelve to fifteen years shouted abominable words to each other, and\r\nto warn them it was necessary to yell still more violently. Then, as\r\nsoon as there was an empty tram to send back, the receiver gave the\r\nsignal and the putter embarked her full tram, the weight of which made\r\nthe other ascend when the brakesman loosened his brake. Below, in the\r\nbottom gallery, were formed the trains which the horses drew to the\r\nshaft.\r\n\r\n"Here, you confounded rascals," cried Catherine in the inclined way,\r\nwhich was wood-lined, about a hundred metres long, and resounded like a\r\ngigantic trumpet.\r\n\r\nThe trammers must have been resting, for neither of them replied. On\r\nall the levels haulage had stopped. A shrill girl\'s voice said at last:\r\n\r\n"One of them must be on Mouquette, sure enough!"\r\n\r\nThere was a roar of laughter, and the putters of the whole seam held\r\ntheir sides.\r\n\r\n"Who is that?" asked \xc3\x89tienne of Catherine.\r\n\r\nThe latter named little Lydie, a scamp who knew more than she ought,\r\nand who pushed her tram as stoutly as a woman in spite of her doll\'s\r\narms. As to Mouquette, she was quite capable of being with both the\r\ntrammers at once.\r\n\r\nBut the voice of the receiver arose, shouting out to load. Doubtless a\r\ncaptain was passing beneath. Haulage began again on the nine levels,\r\nand one only heard the regular calls of the trammers, and the snorting\r\nof the putters arriving at the upbrow and steaming like over-laden\r\nmares. It was the element of bestiality which breathed in the pit, the\r\nsudden desire of the male, when a miner met one of these girls on all\r\nfours, with her flanks in the air and her hips bursting through her\r\nboy\'s breeches.\r\n\r\nAnd on each journey \xc3\x89tienne found again at the bottom the stuffiness\r\nof the cutting, the hollow and broken cadence of the axes, the deep\r\npainful sighs of the pikemen persisting in their work. All four were\r\nnaked, mixed up with the coal, soaked with black mud up to the cap.\r\nAt one moment it had been necessary to free Maheu, who was gasping,\r\nand to remove the planks so that the coal could fall into the passage.\r\nZacharie and Levaque became enraged with the seam, which was now\r\nhard, they said, and which would make the condition of their account\r\ndisastrous. Chaval turned, lying for a moment on his back, abusing\r\n\xc3\x89tienne, whose presence decidedly exasperated him.\r\n\r\n"A sort of worm; hasn\'t the strength of a girl! Are you going to fill\r\nyour tub? It\'s to spare your arms, eh? Damned if I don\'t keep back the\r\nten sous if you get us one refused!"\r\n\r\nThe young man avoided replying, too happy at present to have found\r\nthis convict\'s labour and accepting the brutal rule of the worker by\r\nmaster worker. But he could no longer walk, his feet were bleeding, his\r\nlimbs torn by horrible cramps, his body confined in an iron girdle.\r\nFortunately it was ten o\'clock, and the stall decided to have breakfast.\r\n\r\nMaheu had a watch, but he did not even look at it. At the bottom of\r\nthis starless night he was never five minutes out. All put on their\r\nshirts and jackets. Then, descending from the cutting they squatted\r\ndown, their elbows to their sides, their buttocks on their heels, in\r\nthat posture so habitual with miners that they keep it even when out\r\nof the mine, without feeling the need of a stone or a beam to sit\r\non. And each, having taken out his brick, bit seriously at the thick\r\nslice, uttering occasional words on the morning\'s work. Catherine,\r\nwho remained standing, at last joined \xc3\x89tienne, who had stretched\r\nhimself out farther along, across the rails, with his back against the\r\nplanking. There was a place there almost dry.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t eat?" she said to him, with her mouth full and her brick in\r\nher hand.\r\n\r\nThen she remembered that this youth, wandering about at night without a\r\nsou, perhaps had not a bit of bread.\r\n\r\n"Will you share with me?"\r\n\r\nAnd as he refused, declaring that he was not hungry, while his voice\r\ntrembled with the gnawing in his stomach, she went on cheerfully:\r\n\r\n"Ah! if you are fastidious! But here, I\'ve only bitten on that side.\r\nI\'ll give you this."\r\n\r\nShe had already broken the bread and butter into two pieces. The young\r\nman, taking his half, restrained himself from devouring it all at once,\r\nand placed his arms on his thighs, so that she should not see how he\r\ntrembled. With her quiet air of good comradeship she lay beside him, at\r\nfull length on her stomach, with her chin in one hand, slowly eating\r\nwith the other. Their lamps, placed between them, lit up their faces.\r\n\r\nCatherine looked at him a moment in silence. She must have found him\r\nhandsome, with his delicate face and black moustache. She vaguely\r\nsmiled with pleasure.\r\n\r\n"Then you are an engine-driver, and they sent you away from your\r\nrailway. Why?"\r\n\r\n"Because I struck my chief."\r\n\r\nShe remained stupefied, overwhelmed, with her hereditary ideas of\r\nsubordination and passive obedience.\r\n\r\n"I ought to say that I had been drinking," he went on, and when I drink\r\nI get mad--I could devour myself, and I could devour other people. Yes;\r\nI can\'t swallow two small glasses without wanting to kill someone. Then\r\nI am ill for two days."\r\n\r\n"You mustn\'t drink," she said, seriously.\r\n\r\n"Ah, don\'t be afraid. I know myself."\r\n\r\nAnd he shook his head. He hated brandy with the hatred of the last\r\nchild of a race of drunkards, who suffered in his flesh from all those\r\nancestors, soaked and driven mad by alcohol to such a point that the\r\nleast drop had become poison to him.\r\n\r\n"It is because of mother that I didn\'t like being turned into the\r\nstreet," he said, after having swallowed a mouthful. "Mother is not\r\nhappy, and I used to send her a five-franc piece now and then."\r\n\r\n"Where is she, then, your mother?"\r\n\r\n"At Paris. Laundress, Rue de la Goutte-d\'or."\r\n\r\nThere was silence. When he thought of these things a tremor dimmed his\r\ndark eyes, the sudden anguish of the injury he brooded over in his fine\r\nyouthful strength. For a moment he remained with his looks buried in\r\nthe darkness of the mine; and at that depth, beneath the weight and\r\nsuffocation of the earth, he saw his childhood again, his mother still\r\nbeautiful and strong, forsaken by his father, then taken up again after\r\nhaving married another man, living with the two men who ruined her,\r\nrolling with them in the gutter in drink and ordure. It was down there,\r\nhe recalled the street, the details came back to him; the dirty linen\r\nin the middle of the shop, the drunken carousals that made the house\r\nstink, and the jaw-breaking blows.\r\n\r\n"Now," he began again, in a slow voice, "I haven\'t even thirty sous to\r\nmake her presents with. She will die of misery, sure enough."\r\n\r\nHe shrugged his shoulders with despair, and again bit at his bread and\r\nbutter.\r\n\r\n"Will you drink?" asked Catherine, uncorking her tin. "Oh, it\'s coffee,\r\nit won\'t hurt you. One gets dry when one eats like that."\r\n\r\nBut he refused; it was quite enough to have taken half her bread.\r\nHowever, she insisted good-naturedly, and said at last:\r\n\r\n"Well, I will drink before you since you are so polite. Only you can\'t\r\nrefuse now, it would be rude."\r\n\r\nShe held out her tin to him. She had got on to her knees and he saw\r\nher quite close to him, lit up by the two lamps. Why had he found her\r\nugly? Now that she was black, her face powdered with fine charcoal,\r\nshe seemed to him singularly charming. In this face surrounded by\r\nshadow, the teeth in the broad mouth shone with whiteness, while the\r\neyes looked large and gleamed with a greenish reflection, like a cat\'s\r\neyes. A lock of red hair which had escaped from her cap tickled her ear\r\nand made her laugh. She no longer seemed so young, she might be quite\r\nfourteen.\r\n\r\n"To please you," he said, drinking and giving her back the tin.\r\n\r\nShe swallowed a second mouthful and forced him to take one too, wishing\r\nto share, she said; and that little tin that went from one mouth to\r\nthe other amused them. He suddenly asked himself if he should not take\r\nher in his arms and kiss her lips. She had large lips of a pale rose\r\ncolour, made vivid by the coal, which tormented him with increasing\r\ndesire. But he did not dare, intimidated before her, only having known\r\ngirls on the streets at Lille of the lowest order, and not realizing\r\nhow one ought to behave with a work-girl still living with her family.\r\n\r\n"You must be about fourteen then?" he asked, after having gone back to\r\nhis bread. She was astonished, almost angry.\r\n\r\n"What? fourteen! But I am fifteen! It\'s true I\'m not big. Girls don\'t\r\ngrow quick with us."\r\n\r\nHe went on questioning her and she told everything without boldness\r\nor shame. For the rest she was not ignorant concerning man and woman,\r\nalthough he felt that her body was virginal, with the virginity of a\r\nchild delayed in her sexual maturity by the environment of bad air and\r\nweariness in which she lived. When he spoke of Mouquette, in order to\r\nembarrass her, she told some horrible stories in a quiet voice, with\r\nmuch amusement. Ah! she did some fine things! And as he asked if she\r\nherself had no lovers, she replied jokingly that she did not wish to\r\nvex her mother, but that it must happen some day. Her shoulders were\r\nbent. She shivered a little from the coldness of her garments soaked in\r\nsweat, with a gentle resigned air, ready to submit to things and men.\r\n\r\n"People can find lovers when they all live together, can\'t they?"\r\n\r\n"Sure enough!"\r\n\r\n"And then it doesn\'t hurt any one. One doesn\'t tell the priest."\r\n\r\n"Oh! the priest! I don\'t care for him! But there is the Black Man."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean, the Black Man?"\r\n\r\n"The old miner who comes back into the pit and wrings naughty girls\'\r\nnecks."\r\n\r\nHe looked at her, afraid that she was making fun of him.\r\n\r\n"You believe in those stupid things? Then you don\'t know anything."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I do. I can read and write. That is useful among us; in father\r\nand mother\'s time they learnt nothing."\r\n\r\nShe was certainly very charming. When she had finished her bread and\r\nbutter, he would take her and kiss her on her large rosy lips. It\r\nwas the resolution of timidity, a thought of violence which choked\r\nhis voice. These boy\'s clothes--this jacket and these breeches--on\r\nthe girl\'s flesh excited and troubled him. He had swallowed his last\r\nmouthful. He drank from the tin and gave it back for her to empty. Now\r\nthe moment for action had come, and he cast a restless glance at the\r\nminers farther on. But a shadow blocked the gallery.\r\n\r\nFor a moment Chaval stood and looked at them from afar. He came\r\nforward, having assured himself that Maheu could not see him; and as\r\nCatherine was seated on the earth he seized her by the shoulders, drew\r\nher head back, and tranquilly crushed her mouth beneath a brutal kiss,\r\naffecting not to notice \xc3\x89tienne. There was in that kiss an act of\r\npossession, a sort of jealous resolution.\r\n\r\nHowever, the young girl was offended.\r\n\r\n"Let me go, do you hear?"\r\n\r\nHe kept hold of her head and looked into her eyes. His moustache and\r\nsmall red beard flamed in his black face with its large eagle nose. He\r\nlet her go at last, and went away without speaking a word.\r\n\r\nA shudder had frozen \xc3\x89tienne. It was stupid to have waited. He could\r\ncertainly not kiss her now, for she would, perhaps, think that he\r\nwished to behave like the other. In his wounded vanity he experienced\r\nreal despair.\r\n\r\n"Why did you lie?" he said, in a low voice. "He\'s your lover."\r\n\r\n"But no, I swear," she cried. "There is not that between us. Sometimes\r\nhe likes a joke; he doesn\'t even belong here; it\'s six months since he\r\ncame from the Pas-de-Calais."\r\n\r\nBoth rose; work was about to be resumed. When she saw him so cold she\r\nseemed annoyed. Doubtless she found him handsomer than the other; she\r\nwould have preferred him perhaps. The idea of some amiable, consoling\r\nrelationship disturbed her; and when the young man saw with surprise\r\nthat his lamp was burning blue with a large pale ring, she tried at\r\nleast to amuse him.\r\n\r\n"Come, I will show you something," she said, in a friendly way.\r\n\r\nWhen she had led him to the bottom of the cutting, she pointed out to\r\nhim a crevice in the coal. A slight bubbling escaped from it, a little\r\nnoise like the warbling of a bird.\r\n\r\n"Put your hand there; you\'ll feel the wind. It\'s fire-damp."\r\n\r\nHe was surprised. Was that all? Was that the terrible thing which blew\r\neverything up? She laughed, she said there was a good deal of it to-day\r\nto make the flame of the lamps so blue.\r\n\r\n"Now, if you\'ve done chattering, lazy louts!" cried Maheu\'s rough voice.\r\n\r\nCatherine and \xc3\x89tienne hastened to fill their trams, and pushed them\r\nto the upbrow with stiffened back, crawling beneath the bossy roof of\r\nthe passage. Even after the second journey, the sweat ran off them and\r\ntheir joints began to crack.\r\n\r\nThe pikemen had resumed work in the cutting. The men often shortened\r\ntheir breakfast to avoid getting cold; and their bricks, eaten in this\r\nway, far from the sun, with silent voracity, loaded their stomachs\r\nwith lead. Stretched on their sides they hammered more loudly, with\r\nthe one fixed idea of filling a large number of trams. Every thought\r\ndisappeared in this rage for gain which was so hard to earn. They no\r\nlonger felt the water which streamed on them and swelled their limbs,\r\nthe cramps of forced attitudes, the suffocation of the darkness in\r\nwhich they grew pale, like plants put in a cellar. Yet, as the day\r\nadvanced, the air became more poisoned and heated with the smoke of\r\nthe lamps, with the pestilence of their breaths, with the asphyxia of\r\nthe fire-damp--blinding to the eyes like spiders\' webs--which only\r\nthe aeration of the night could sweep away. At the bottom of their\r\nmole-hill, beneath the weight of the earth, with no more breath in\r\ntheir inflamed lungs, they went on hammering.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\nMaheu, without looking at his watch which he had left in his jacket,\r\nstopped and said:\r\n\r\n"One o\'clock directly. Zacharie, is it done?"\r\n\r\nThe young man had just been at the planking. In the midst of his labour\r\nhe had been lying on his back, with dreamy eyes, thinking over a game\r\nof hockey of the night before. He woke up and replied:\r\n\r\n"Yes, it will do; we shall see to-morrow."\r\n\r\nAnd he came back to take his place at the cutting. Levaque and Chaval\r\nhad also dropped their picks. They were all resting. They wiped their\r\nfaces on their naked arms and looked at the roof, in which slaty masses\r\nwere cracking. They only spoke about their work.\r\n\r\n"Another chance," murmured Chaval, "of getting into loose earth. They\r\ndidn\'t take account of that in the bargain."\r\n\r\n"Rascals!" growled Levaque. "They only want to bury us in it."\r\n\r\nZacharie began to laugh. He cared little for the work and the rest,\r\nbut it amused him to hear the Company abused. In his placid way Maheu\r\nexplained that the nature of the soil changed every twenty metres. One\r\nmust be just; they could not foresee everything. Then, when the two\r\nothers went on talking against the masters, he became restless, and\r\nlooked around him.\r\n\r\n"Hush! that\'s enough."\r\n\r\n"You\'re right," said Levaque, also lowering his voice; "it isn\'t\r\nwholesome."\r\n\r\nA morbid dread of spies haunted them, even at this depth, as if the\r\nshareholders\' coal, while still in the seam, might have ears.\r\n\r\n"That won\'t prevent me," added Chaval loudly, in a defiant manner,\r\n"from lodging a brick in the belly of that damned Dansaert, if he talks\r\nto me as he did the other day. I won\'t prevent him, I won\'t, from\r\nbuying pretty girls with a white skin."\r\n\r\nThis time Zacharie burst out laughing. The head captain\'s love for\r\nPierronne was a constant joke in the pit. Even Catherine rested on her\r\nshovel at the bottom of the cutting, holding her sides, and in a few\r\nwords told \xc3\x89tienne the joke; while Maheu became angry, seized by a fear\r\nwhich he could not conceal.\r\n\r\n"Will you hold your tongue, eh? Wait till you\'re alone if you want to\r\nget into trouble."\r\n\r\nHe was still speaking when the sound of steps was heard in the upper\r\ngallery. Almost immediately the engineer of the mine, little N\xc3\xa9grel,\r\nas the workmen called him among themselves, appeared at the top of the\r\ncutting, accompanied by Dansaert, the head captain.\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t I say so?" muttered Maheu. "There\'s always someone there,\r\nrising out of the ground."\r\n\r\nPaul N\xc3\xa9grel, M. Hennebeau\'s nephew, was a young man of twenty-six,\r\nrefined and handsome, with curly hair and brown moustache. His pointed\r\nnose and sparkling eyes gave him the air of an amiable ferret of\r\nsceptical intelligence, which changed into an abrupt authoritative\r\nmanner in his relations with the workmen. He was dressed like them, and\r\nlike them smeared with coal; to make them respect him he exhibited a\r\ndare-devil courage, passing through the most difficult spots and always\r\nfirst when landslips or fire-damp explosions occurred.\r\n\r\n"Here we are, are we not, Dansaert?" he asked.\r\n\r\nThe head captain, a coarse-faced Belgian, with a large sensual nose,\r\nreplied with exaggerated politeness:\r\n\r\n"Yes, Monsieur N\xc3\xa9grel. Here is the man who was taken on this morning."\r\n\r\nBoth of them had slid down into the middle of the cutting. They made\r\n\xc3\x89tienne come up. The engineer raised his lamp and looked at him without\r\nasking any questions.\r\n\r\n"Good," he said at last. "But I don\'t like unknown men to be picked up\r\nfrom the road. Don\'t do it again."\r\n\r\nHe did not listen to the explanations given to him, the necessities of\r\nwork, the desire to replace women by men for the haulage. He had begun\r\nto examine the roof while the pikemen had taken up their picks again.\r\nSuddenly he called out:\r\n\r\n"I say there, Maheu; have you no care for life? By heavens! you will\r\nall be buried here!"\r\n\r\n"Oh! it\'s solid," replied the workman tranquilly.\r\n\r\n"What! solid! but the rock is giving already, and you are planting\r\nprops at more than two metres, as if you grudged it! Ah! you are all\r\nalike. You will let your skull be flattened rather than leave the seam\r\nto give the necessary time to the timbering! I must ask you to prop\r\nthat immediately. Double the timbering--do you understand?"\r\n\r\nAnd in face of the unwillingness of the miners who disputed the point,\r\nsaying that they were good judges of their safety, he became angry.\r\n\r\n"Go along! when your heads are smashed, is it you who will have to bear\r\nthe consequences? Not at all! it will be the Company which will have to\r\npay you pensions, you or your wives. I tell you again that we know you;\r\nin order to get two extra trams by evening you would sell your skins."\r\n\r\nMaheu, in spite of the anger which was gradually mastering him, still\r\nanswered steadily:\r\n\r\n"If they paid us enough we should prop it better."\r\n\r\nThe engineer shrugged his shoulders without replying. He had descended\r\nthe cutting, and only said in conclusion, from below:\r\n\r\n"You have an hour. Set to work, all of you; and I give you notice that\r\nthe stall is fined three francs."\r\n\r\nA low growl from the pikemen greeted these words. The force of the\r\nsystem alone restrained them, that military system which, from the\r\ntrammer to the head captain, ground one beneath the other. Chaval\r\nand Levaque, however, made a furious gesture, while Maheu restrained\r\nthem by a glance, and Zacharie shrugged his shoulders chaffingly. But\r\n\xc3\x89tienne was, perhaps, most affected. Since he had found himself at the\r\nbottom of this hell a slow rebellion was rising within him. He looked\r\nat the resigned Catherine, with her lowered back. Was it possible to\r\nkill oneself at this hard toil, in this deadly darkness, and not even\r\nto gain the few pence to buy one\'s daily bread?\r\n\r\nHowever, N\xc3\xa9grel went off with Dansaert, who was content to approve by\r\na continual movement of his head. And their voices again rose; they\r\nhad just stopped once more, and were examining the timbering in the\r\ngallery, which the pikemen were obliged to look after for a length of\r\nten metres behind the cutting.\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t I tell you that they care nothing?" cried the engineer. "And\r\nyou! why, in the devil\'s name, don\'t you watch them?"\r\n\r\n"But I do--I do," stammered the head captain. "One gets tired of\r\nrepeating things."\r\n\r\nN\xc3\xa9grel called loudly:\r\n\r\n"Maheu! Maheu!"\r\n\r\nThey all came down. He went on:\r\n\r\n"Do you see that? Will that hold? It\'s a twopenny-halfpenny\r\nconstruction! Here is a beam which the posts don\'t carry already, it\r\nwas done so hastily. By Jove! I understand how it is that the mending\r\ncosts us so much. It\'ll do, won\'t it? if it lasts as long as you have\r\nthe care of it; and then it may go smash, and the Company is obliged to\r\nhave an army of repairers. Look at it down there; it is mere botching!"\r\n\r\nChaval wished to speak, but he silenced him.\r\n\r\n"No! I know what you are going to say. Let them pay you more, eh? Very\r\nwell! I warn you that you will force the managers to do something: they\r\nwill pay you the planking separately, and proportionately reduce the\r\nprice of the trams. We shall see if you will gain that way! Meanwhile,\r\nprop that over again, at once; I shall pass to-morrow."\r\n\r\nAmid the dismay caused by this threat he went away. Dansaert, who had\r\nbeen so humble, remained behind a few moments, to say brutally to the\r\nmen:\r\n\r\n"You get me into a row, you here. I\'ll give you something more than\r\nthree francs fine, I will. Look out!"\r\n\r\nThen, when he had gone, Maheu broke out in his turn:\r\n\r\n"By God! what\'s fair is fair! I like people to be calm, because that\'s\r\nthe only way of getting along, but at last they make you mad. Did you\r\nhear? The tram lowered, and the planking separately! Another way of\r\npaying us less. By God it is!"\r\n\r\nHe looked for someone upon whom to vent his anger, and saw Catherine\r\nand \xc3\x89tienne swinging their arms.\r\n\r\n"Will you just fetch me some wood! What does it matter to you? I\'ll put\r\nmy foot into you somewhere!"\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne went to carry it without rancour for this rough speech, so\r\nfurious himself against the masters that he thought the miners too\r\ngood-natured. As for the others, Levaque and Chaval had found relief in\r\nstrong language. All of them, even Zacharie, were timbering furiously.\r\nFor nearly half an hour one only heard the creaking of wood wedged in\r\nby blows of the hammer.\r\n\r\nThey no longer spoke, they snorted, became enraged with the rock, which\r\nthey would have hustled and driven back by the force of their shoulders\r\nif they had been able.\r\n\r\n"That\'s enough," said Maheu at last, worn out with anger and fatigue.\r\n"An hour and a half! A fine day\'s work! We shan\'t get fifty sous! I\'m\r\noff. This disgusts me."\r\n\r\nThough there was still half an hour of work left he dressed himself.\r\nThe others imitated him. The mere sight of the cutting enraged them. As\r\nthe putter had gone back to the haulage they called her, irritated at\r\nher zeal: let the coal take care of itself. And the six, their tools\r\nunder their arms, set out to walk the two kilometres back, returning to\r\nthe shaft by the road of the morning.\r\n\r\nAt the chimney Catherine and \xc3\x89tienne were delayed while the pikemen\r\nslid down. They met little Lydie, who stopped in a gallery to let them\r\npass, and told them of the disappearance of Mouquette, whose nose had\r\nbeen bleeding so much that she had been away an hour, bathing her face\r\nsomewhere, no one knew where. Then, when they left her, the child began\r\nagain to push her tram, weary and muddy, stiffening her insect-like\r\narms and legs like a lean black ant struggling with a load that was too\r\nheavy for it. They let themselves down on their backs, flattening their\r\nshoulders for fear of scratching the skin on their foreheads, and they\r\nwalked so close to the polished rock at the back of the stalls that\r\nthey were obliged from time to time to hold on to the woodwork, so that\r\ntheir backsides should not catch fire, as they said jokingly.\r\n\r\nBelow they found themselves alone. Red stars disappeared afar at a\r\nbend in the passage. Their cheerfulness fell, they began to walk with\r\nthe heavy step of fatigue, she in front, he behind. Their lamps were\r\nblackened. He could scarcely see her, drowned in a sort of smoky mist;\r\nand the idea that she was a girl disturbed him because he felt that it\r\nwas stupid not to embrace her, and yet the recollection of the other\r\nman prevented him. Certainly she had lied to him: the other was her\r\nlover, they lay together on all those heaps of slaty coal, for she had\r\na loose woman\'s gait. He sulked without reason, as if she had deceived\r\nhim. She, however, every moment turned round, warned him of obstacles,\r\nand seemed to invite him to be affectionate. They were so lost here,\r\nit would have been so easy to laugh together like good friends! At\r\nlast they entered the large haulage gallery; it was a relief to the\r\nindecision from which he was suffering; while she once more had a\r\nsaddened look, the regret for a happiness which they would not find\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nNow the subterranean life rumbled around them with a continual passing\r\nof captains, the come and go of the trams drawn by trotting horses.\r\nLamps starred the night everywhere. They had to efface themselves\r\nagainst the rock to leave the path free to shadowy men and beasts,\r\nwhose breath came against their faces. Jeanlin, running barefooted\r\nbehind his tram, cried out some naughtiness to them which they could\r\nnot hear amid the thunder of the wheels. They still went on, she now\r\nsilent, he not recognizing the turnings and roads of the morning, and\r\nfancying that she was leading him deeper and deeper into the earth; and\r\nwhat specially troubled him was the cold, an increasing cold which he\r\nhad felt on emerging from the cutting, and which caused him to shiver\r\nthe more the nearer they approached the shaft. Between the narrow walls\r\nthe column of air now blew like a tempest. He despaired of ever coming\r\nto the end, when suddenly they found themselves in the pit-eye hall.\r\n\r\nChaval cast a sidelong glance at them, his mouth drawn with suspicion.\r\nThe others were there, covered with sweat in the icy current, silent\r\nlike himself, swallowing their grunts of rage. They had arrived\r\ntoo soon and could not be taken to the top for half an hour, more\r\nespecially since some complicated manoeuvres were going on for\r\nlowering a horse. The porters were still rolling the trams with the\r\ndeafening sound of old iron in movement, and the cages were flying up,\r\ndisappearing in the rain which fell from the black hole. Below, the\r\nsump, a cesspool ten metres deep, filled with this streaming water,\r\nalso exhaled its muddy moisture. Men were constantly moving around the\r\nshaft, pulling the signal cords, pressing on the arms of levers, in the\r\nmidst of this spray in which their garments were soaked. The reddish\r\nlight of three open lamps cut out great moving shadows and gave to this\r\nsubterranean hall the air of a villainous cavern, some bandits\' forge\r\nnear a torrent.\r\n\r\nMaheu made one last effort. He approached Pierron, who had gone on duty\r\nat six o\'clock.\r\n\r\n"Here! you might as well let us go up."\r\n\r\nBut the porter, a handsome fellow with strong limbs and a gentle face,\r\nrefused with a frightened gesture.\r\n\r\n"Impossible: ask the captain. They would fine me."\r\n\r\nFresh growls were stifled. Catherine bent forward and said in \xc3\x89tienne\'s\r\near:\r\n\r\n"Come and see the stable, then. That\'s a comfortable place!"\r\n\r\nAnd they had to escape without being seen, for it was forbidden to go\r\nthere. It was on the left, at the end of a short gallery. Twenty-five\r\nmetres in length and nearly four high, cut in the rock and vaulted with\r\nbricks, it could contain twenty horses. It was, in fact, comfortable\r\nthere. There was a pleasant warmth of living beasts, the good odour of\r\nfresh and well-kept litter. The only lamp threw out the calm rays of a\r\nnight-light. There were horses there, at rest, who turned their heads,\r\nwith their large infantine eyes, then went back to their hay, without\r\nhaste, like fat well-kept workers, loved by everybody.\r\n\r\nBut as Catherine was reading aloud their names, written on zinc plates\r\nover the mangers, she uttered a slight cry, seeing something suddenly\r\nrise before her. It was Mouquette, who emerged in fright from a pile of\r\nstraw in which she was sleeping. On Monday, when she was overtired with\r\nher Sunday\'s spree, she gave herself a violent blow on the nose, and\r\nleft her cutting under the pretence of seeking water, to bury herself\r\nhere with the horses in the warm litter. Her father, being weak with\r\nher, allowed it, at the risk of getting into trouble.\r\n\r\nJust then, Mouque, the father, entered, a short, bald, worn-out looking\r\nman, but still stout, which is rare in an old miner of fifty. Since he\r\nhad been made a groom, he chewed to such a degree that his gums bled in\r\nhis black mouth. On seeing the two with his daughter, he became angry.\r\n\r\n"What are you up to there, all of you? Come! up! The jades, bringing\r\na man here! It\'s a fine thing to come and do your dirty tricks in my\r\nstraw."\r\n\r\nMouquette thought it funny, and held her sides. But \xc3\x89tienne, feeling\r\nawkward, moved away, while Catherine smiled at him. As all three\r\nreturned to the pit-eye, B\xc3\xa9bert and Jeanlin arrived there also with a\r\ntrain of tubs. There was a stoppage for the manoeuvring of the cages,\r\nand the young girl approached their horse, caressed it with her hand,\r\nand talked about it to her companion. It was Bataille, the _doyen_\r\nof the mine, a white horse who had lived below for ten years. These\r\nten years he had lived in this hole, occupying the same corner of the\r\nstable, doing the same task along the black galleries without ever\r\nseeing daylight. Very fat, with shining coat and a good-natured air,\r\nhe seemed to lead the existence of a sage, sheltered from the evils of\r\nthe world above. In this darkness, too, he had become very cunning.\r\nThe passage in which he worked had grown so familiar to him that he\r\ncould open the ventilation doors with his head, and he lowered himself\r\nto avoid knocks at the narrow spots. Without doubt, also, he counted\r\nhis turns, for when he had made the regulation number of journeys he\r\nrefused to do any more, and had to be led back to his manger. Now\r\nthat old age was coming on, his cat\'s eyes were sometimes dimmed with\r\nmelancholy. Perhaps he vaguely saw again, in the depths of his obscure\r\ndreams, the mill at which he was born, near Marchiennes, a mill placed\r\non the edge of the Scarpe, surrounded by large fields over which the\r\nwind always blew. Something burnt in the air--an enormous lamp, the\r\nexact appearance of which escaped his beast\'s memory--and he stood with\r\nlowered head, trembling on his old feet, making useless efforts to\r\nrecall the sun.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the manoeuvres went on in the shaft, the signal hammer had\r\nstruck four blows, and the horse was being lowered; there was always\r\nexcitement at such a time, for it sometimes happened that the beast\r\nwas seized by such terror that it was landed dead. When put into a net\r\nat the top it struggled fiercely; then, when it felt the ground no\r\nlonger beneath it, it remained as if petrified and disappeared without\r\na quiver of the skin, with enlarged and fixed eyes. This animal being\r\ntoo big to pass between the guides, it had been necessary, when hooking\r\nit beneath the cage, to pull down the head and attach it to the flanks.\r\nThe descent lasted nearly three minutes, the engine being slowed as\r\na precaution. Below, the excitement was increasing. What then? Was\r\nhe going to be left on the road, hanging in the blackness? At last\r\nhe appeared in his stony immobility, his eye fixed and dilated with\r\nterror. It was a bay horse hardly three years of age, called Trompette.\r\n\r\n"Attention!" cried Father Mouque, whose duty it was to receive it.\r\n"Bring him here, don\'t undo him yet."\r\n\r\nTrompette was soon placed on the metal floor in a mass. Still he did\r\nnot move: he seemed in a nightmare in this obscure infinite hole, this\r\ndeep hall echoing with tumult. They were beginning to unfasten him\r\nwhen Bataille, who had just been unharnessed, approached and stretched\r\nout his neck to smell this companion who lay on the earth. The workmen\r\njokingly enlarged the circle. Well! what pleasant odour did he find in\r\nhim? But Bataille, deaf to mockery, became animated. He probably found\r\nin him the good odour of the open air, the forgotten odour of the sun\r\non the grass. And he suddenly broke out into a sonorous neigh, full of\r\nmusical gladness, in which there seemed to be the emotion of a sob. It\r\nwas a greeting, the joy of those ancient things of which a gust had\r\nreached him, the melancholy of one more prisoner who would not ascend\r\nagain until death.\r\n\r\n"Ah! that animal Bataille!" shouted the workmen, amused at the antics\r\nof their favourite, "he\'s talking with his mate."\r\n\r\nTrompette was unbound, but still did not move. He remained on his\r\nflank, as if he still felt the net restraining him, garrotted by fear.\r\nAt last they got him up with a lash of the whip, dazed and his limbs\r\nquivering. And Father Mouque led away the two beasts, fraternizing\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n"Here! Is it ready yet?" asked Maheu.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary to clear the cages, and besides it was yet ten\r\nminutes before the hour for ascending. Little by little the stalls\r\nemptied, and the miners returned from all the galleries. There were\r\nalready some fifty men there, damp and shivering, their inflamed\r\nchests panting on every side. Pierron, in spite of his mawkish face,\r\nstruck his daughter Lydie, because she had left the cutting before\r\ntime. Zacharie slyly pinched Mouquette, with a joke about warming\r\nhimself. But the discontent increased; Chaval and Levaque narrated the\r\nengineer\'s threat, the tram to be lowered in price, and the planking\r\npaid separately. And exclamations greeted this scheme, a rebellion was\r\ngerminating in this little corner, nearly six hundred metres beneath\r\nthe earth. Soon they could not restrain their voices; these men, soiled\r\nby coal, and frozen by the delay, accused the Company of killing half\r\ntheir workers at the bottom, and starving the other half to death.\r\n\xc3\x89tienne listened, trembling.\r\n\r\n"Quick, quick!" repeated the captain, Richomme, to the porters.\r\n\r\nHe hastened the preparations for the ascent, not wishing to be hard,\r\npretending not to hear. However, the murmurs became so loud that he\r\nwas obliged to notice them. They were calling out behind him that this\r\nwould not last always, and that one fine day the whole affair would be\r\nsmashed up.\r\n\r\n"You\'re sensible," he said to Maheu; "make them hold their tongues.\r\nWhen one hasn\'t got power one must have sense."\r\n\r\nBut Maheu, who was getting calm, and had at last become anxious, did\r\nnot interfere. Suddenly the voices fell; N\xc3\xa9grel and Dansaert, returning\r\nfrom their inspection, entered from a gallery, both of them sweating.\r\nThe habit of discipline made the men stand in rows while the engineer\r\npassed through the group without a word. He got into one tram, and the\r\nhead captain into another, the signal was sounded five times, ringing\r\nfor the butcher\'s meat, as they said for the masters; and the cage flew\r\nup in the air in the midst of a gloomy silence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\nAs he ascended in the cage heaped up with four others, \xc3\x89tienne resolved\r\nto continue his famished course along the roads. One might as well\r\ndie at once as go down to the bottom of that hell, where it was not\r\neven possible to earn one\'s bread. Catherine, in the tram above him,\r\nwas no longer at his side with her pleasant enervating warmth; and he\r\npreferred to avoid foolish thoughts and to go away, for with his wider\r\neducation he felt nothing of the resignation of this flock; he would\r\nend by strangling one of the masters.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he was blinded. The ascent had been so rapid that he was\r\nstunned by the daylight, and his eyelids quivered in the brightness to\r\nwhich he had already grown unaccustomed. It was none the less a relief\r\nto him to feel the cage settle on to the bars. A lander opened the\r\ndoor, and a flood of workmen leapt out of the trams.\r\n\r\n"I say, Mouquet," whispered Zacharie in the lander\'s ear, "are we off\r\nto the Volcan to-night?"\r\n\r\nThe Volcan was a caf\xc3\xa9-concert at Montsou. Mouquet winked his left eye\r\nwith a silent laugh which made his jaws gape. Short and stout like his\r\nfather, he had the impudent face of a fellow who devours everything\r\nwithout care for the morrow. Just then Mouquette came out in her turn,\r\nand he gave her a formidable smack on the flank by way of fraternal\r\ntenderness.\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne hardly recognized the lofty nave of the receiving-hall, which\r\nhad before looked imposing in the ambiguous light of the lanterns.\r\nIt was simply bare and dirty; a dull light entered through the dusty\r\nwindows. The engine alone shone at the end with its copper; the\r\nwell-greased steel cables moved like ribbons soaked in ink, and the\r\npulleys above, the enormous scaffold which supported them, the cages,\r\nthe trams, all this prodigality of metal made the hall look sombre with\r\ntheir hard grey tones of old iron. Without ceasing, the rumbling of the\r\nwheels shook the metal floor; while from the coal thus put in motion\r\nthere arose a fine charcoal powder which powdered black the soil, the\r\nwalls, even the joists of the steeple.\r\n\r\nBut Chaval, after glancing at the table of counters in the receiver\'s\r\nlittle glass office, came back furious. He had discovered that two\r\nof their trams had been rejected, one because it did not contain the\r\nregulation amount, the other because the coal was not clean.\r\n\r\n"This finishes the day," he cried. "Twenty sous less again! This is\r\nbecause we take on lazy rascals who use their arms as a pig does his\r\ntail!"\r\n\r\nAnd his sidelong look at \xc3\x89tienne completed his thought.\r\n\r\nThe latter was tempted to reply by a blow. Then he asked himself what\r\nwould be the use since he was going away. This decided him absolutely.\r\n\r\n"It\'s not possible to do it right the first day," said Maheu, to\r\nrestore peace; "he\'ll do better to-morrow."\r\n\r\nThey were all none the less soured, and disturbed by the need to\r\nquarrel. As they passed to the lamp cabin to give up their lamps,\r\nLevaque began to abuse the lamp-man, whom he accused of not properly\r\ncleaning his lamp. They only slackened down a little in the shed where\r\nthe fire was still burning. It had even been too heavily piled up, for\r\nthe stove was red and the vast room, without a window, seemed to be\r\nin flames, to such a degree did the reflection make bloody the walls.\r\nAnd there were grunts of joy, all the backs were roasted at a distance\r\ntill they smoked like soup. When their flanks were burning they cooked\r\ntheir bellies. Mouquette had tranquilly let down her breeches to dry\r\nher chemise. Some lads were making fun of her; they burst out laughing\r\nbecause she suddenly showed them her posterior, a gesture which in her\r\nwas the extreme expression of contempt.\r\n\r\n"I\'m off," said Chaval, who had shut up his tools in his box.\r\n\r\nNo one moved. Only Mouquette hastened, and went out behind him on the\r\npretext that they were both going back to Montsou. But the others went\r\non joking; they knew that he would have no more to do with her.\r\n\r\nCatherine, however, who seemed preoccupied, was speaking in a low voice\r\nto her father. The latter was surprised; then he agreed with a nod; and\r\ncalling \xc3\x89tienne to give him back his bundle:\r\n\r\n"Listen," he said: "you haven\'t a sou; you will have time to starve\r\nbefore the fortnight\'s out. Shall I try and get you credit somewhere?"\r\n\r\nThe young man stood for a moment confused. He had been just about to\r\nclaim his thirty sous and go. But shame restrained him before the\r\nyoung girl. She looked at him fixedly; perhaps she would think he was\r\nshirking the work.\r\n\r\n"You know I can promise you nothing," Maheu went on. "They can but\r\nrefuse us."\r\n\r\nThen \xc3\x89tienne consented. They would refuse. Besides, it would bind him\r\nto nothing, he could still go away after having eaten something. Then\r\nhe was dissatisfied at not having refused, seeing Catherine\'s joy, a\r\npretty laugh, a look of friendship, happy at having been useful to him.\r\nWhat was the good of it all?\r\n\r\nWhen they had put on their sabots and shut their boxes, the Maheus left\r\nthe shed, following their comrades, who were leaving one by one after\r\nthey had warmed themselves. \xc3\x89tienne went behind. Levaque and his urchin\r\njoined the band. But as they crossed the screening place a scene of\r\nviolence stopped them.\r\n\r\nIt was in a vast shed, with beams blackened by the powder, and large\r\nshutters, through which blew a constant current of air. The coal trams\r\narrived straight from the receiving-room, and were then overturned by\r\nthe tipping-cradles on to hoppers, long iron slides; and to right and\r\nto left of these the screeners, mounted on steps and armed with shovels\r\nand rakes, separated the stone and swept together the clean coal, which\r\nafterwards fell through funnels into the railway wagons beneath the\r\nshed.\r\n\r\nPhilom\xc3\xa9ne Levaque was there, thin and pale, with the sheep-like face of\r\na girl who spat blood. With head protected by a fragment of blue wool,\r\nand hands and arms black to the elbows, she was screening beneath an\r\nold witch, the mother of Pierronne, the Brul\xc3\xa9, as she was called, with\r\nterrible owl\'s eyes, and a mouth drawn in like a miser\'s purse. They\r\nwere abusing each other, the young one accusing the elder of raking her\r\nstones so that she could not get a basketful in ten minutes. They were\r\npaid by the basket, and these quarrels were constantly arising. Hair\r\nwas flying, and hands were making black marks on red faces.\r\n\r\n"Give it her bloody well!" cried Zacharie, from above, to his mistress.\r\n\r\nAll the screeners laughed. But the Brul\xc3\xa9 turned snappishly on the young\r\nman.\r\n\r\n"Now, then, dirty beast! You\'d better to own the two kids you have\r\nfilled her with. Fancy that, a slip of eighteen, who can\'t stand\r\nstraight!"\r\n\r\nMaheu had to prevent his son from descending to see, as he said, the\r\ncolour of this carcass\'s skin.\r\n\r\nA foreman came up and the rakes again began to move the coal. One could\r\nonly see, all along the hoppers, the round backs of women squabbling\r\nincessantly over the stones.\r\n\r\nOutside, the wind had suddenly quieted; a moist cold was falling from a\r\ngrey sky. The colliers thrust out their shoulders, folded their arms,\r\nand set forth irregularly, with a rolling gait which made their large\r\nbones stand out beneath their thin garments. In the daylight they\r\nlooked like a band of Negroes thrown into the mud. Some of them had not\r\nfinished their bricks; and the remains of the bread carried between the\r\nshirt and the jacket made them humpbacked.\r\n\r\n"Hallo! there\'s Bouteloup." said Zacharie, grinning.\r\n\r\nLevaque without stopping exchanged two sentences with his lodger, a big\r\ndark fellow of thirty-five with a placid, honest air:\r\n\r\n"Is the soup ready, Louis?"\r\n\r\n"I believe it is."\r\n\r\n"Then the wife is good-humoured to-day."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I believe she is."\r\n\r\nOther miners bound for the earth-cutting came up, new bands which one\r\nby one were engulfed in the pit. It was the three o\'clock descent, more\r\nmen for the pit to devour, the gangs who would replace the sets of the\r\npikemen at the bottom of the passages. The mine never rested; day and\r\nnight human insects were digging out the rock six hundred metres below\r\nthe beetroot fields.\r\n\r\nHowever, the youngsters went ahead. Jeanlin confided to B\xc3\xa9bert a\r\ncomplicated plan for getting four sous\' worth of tobacco on credit,\r\nwhile Lydie followed respectfully at a distance. Catherine came with\r\nZacharie and \xc3\x89tienne. None of them spoke. And it was only in front of\r\nthe Avantage inn that Maheu and Levaque rejoined them.\r\n\r\n"Here we are," said the former to \xc3\x89tienne; "will you come in?"\r\n\r\nThey separated. Catherine had stood a moment motionless, gazing once\r\nmore at the young man with her large eyes full of greenish limpidity\r\nlike spring water, the crystal deepened the more by her black face. She\r\nsmiled and disappeared with the others on the road that led up to the\r\nsettlement.\r\n\r\nThe inn was situated between the village and the mine, at the crossing\r\nof two roads. It was a two-storied brick house, whitewashed from top\r\nto bottom, enlivened around the windows by a broad pale-blue border.\r\nOn a square sign-board nailed above the door, one read in yellow\r\nletters: _A l\'Avantage, licensed to Rasseneur._ Behind stretched\r\na skittle-ground enclosed by a hedge. The Company, who had done\r\neverything to buy up the property placed within its vast territory, was\r\nin despair over this inn in the open fields, at the very entrance of\r\nthe Voreux.\r\n\r\n"Go in," said Maheu to \xc3\x89tienne.\r\n\r\nThe little parlour was quite bare with its white walls, its three\r\ntables and its dozen chairs, its deal counter about the size of a\r\nkitchen dresser. There were a dozen glasses at most, three bottles of\r\nliqueur, a decanter, a small zinc tank with a pewter tap to hold the\r\nbeer; and nothing else--not a figure, not a little table, not a game.\r\nIn the metal fireplace, which was bright and polished, a coal fire was\r\nburning quietly. On the flags a thin layer of white sand drank up the\r\nconstant moisture of this water-soaked land.\r\n\r\n"A glass," ordered Maheu of a big fair girl, a neighbour\'s daughter who\r\nsometimes took charge of the place. "Is Rasseneur in?"\r\n\r\nThe girl turned the tap, replying that the master would soon return.\r\nIn a long, slow gulp, the miner emptied half his glass to sweep away\r\nthe dust which filled his throat. He offered nothing to his companion.\r\nOne other customer, a damp and besmeared miner, was seated before the\r\ntable, drinking his beer in silence, with an air of deep meditation. A\r\nthird entered, was served in response to a gesture, paid and went away\r\nwithout uttering a word.\r\n\r\nBut a stout man of thirty-eight, with a round shaven face and a\r\ngood-natured smile, now appeared. It was Rasseneur, a former pikeman\r\nwhom the Company had dismissed three years ago, after a strike. A very\r\ngood workman, he could speak well, put himself at the head of every\r\nopposition, and had at last become the chief of the discontented. His\r\nwife already held a license, like many miners\' wives; and when he was\r\nthrown on to the street he became an innkeeper himself; having found\r\nthe money, he placed his inn in front of the Voreux as a provocation\r\nto the Company. Now his house had prospered; it had become a centre,\r\nand he was enriched by the animosity he had gradually fostered in the\r\nhearts of his old comrades.\r\n\r\n"This is a lad I hired this morning," said Maheu at once. "Have you\r\ngot one of your two rooms free, and will you give him credit for a\r\nfortnight?"\r\n\r\nRasseneur\'s broad face suddenly expressed great suspicion. He examined\r\n\xc3\x89tienne with a glance, and replied, without giving himself the trouble\r\nto express any regret:\r\n\r\n"My two rooms are taken. Can\'t do it."\r\n\r\nThe young man expected this refusal; but it hurt him nevertheless,\r\nand he was surprised at the sudden grief he experienced in going. No\r\nmatter; he would go when he had received his thirty sous. The miner\r\nwho was drinking at a table had left. Others, one by one, continued to\r\ncome in to clear their throats, then went on their road with the same\r\nslouching gait. It was a simple swilling without joy or passion, the\r\nsilent satisfaction of a need.\r\n\r\n"Then, there\'s no news?" Rasseneur asked in a peculiar tone of Maheu,\r\nwho was finishing his beer in small gulps.\r\n\r\nThe latter turned his head, and saw that only \xc3\x89tienne was near.\r\n\r\n"There\'s been more squabbling. Yes, about the timbering." He told the\r\nstory. The innkeeper\'s face reddened, swelling with emotion, which\r\nflamed in his skin and eyes. At last he broke out:\r\n\r\n"Well, well! if they decide to lower the price they are done for."\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne constrained him. However he went on, throwing sidelong glances\r\nin his direction. And there were reticences, and implications; he was\r\ntalking of the manager, M. Hennebeau, of his wife, of his nephew, the\r\nlittle N\xc3\xa9grel, without naming them, repeating that this could not go\r\non, that things were bound to smash up one of these fine days. The\r\nmisery was too great; and he spoke of the workshops that were closing,\r\nthe workers who were going away. During the last month he had given\r\nmore than six pounds of bread a day. He had heard the day before, that\r\nM. Deneulin, the owner of a neighbouring pit, could scarcely keep\r\ngoing. He had also received a letter from Lille full of disturbing\r\ndetails.\r\n\r\n"You know," he whispered, "it comes from that person you saw here one\r\nevening."\r\n\r\nBut he was interrupted. His wife entered in her turn, a tall woman,\r\nlean and keen, with a long nose and violet cheeks. She was a much more\r\nradical politician than her husband.\r\n\r\n"Pluchart\'s letter," she said. "Ah! if that fellow was master things\r\nwould soon go better."\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne had been listening for a moment; he understood and became\r\nexcited over these ideas of misery and revenge. This name, suddenly\r\nuttered, caused him to start. He said aloud, as if in spite of himself:\r\n\r\n"I know him--Pluchart."\r\n\r\nThey looked at him. He had to add:\r\n\r\n"Yes, I am an engine-man: he was my foreman at Lille. A capable man. I\r\nhave often talked with him."\r\n\r\nRasseneur examined him afresh; and there was a rapid change on his\r\nface, a sudden sympathy. At last he said to his wife:\r\n\r\n"It\'s Maheu who brings me this gentleman, one of his putters, to see if\r\nthere is a room for him upstairs, and if we can give him credit for a\r\nfortnight."\r\n\r\nThen the matter was settled in four words. There was a room; the\r\nlodger had left that morning. And the innkeeper, who was very excited,\r\ntalked more freely, repeating that he only asked possibilities from\r\nthe masters, without demanding, like so many others, things that were\r\ntoo hard to get. His wife shrugged her shoulders and demanded justice,\r\nabsolutely.\r\n\r\n"Good evening," interrupted Maheu. "All that won\'t prevent men from\r\ngoing down, and as long as they go there will be people working\r\nthemselves to death. Look how fresh you are, these three years that\r\nyou\'ve been out of it."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I\'m very much better," declared Rasseneur, complacently.\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne went as far as the door, thanking the miner, who was leaving;\r\nbut the latter nodded his head without adding a word, and the young\r\nman watched him painfully climb up the road to the settlement. Madame\r\nRasseneur, occupied with serving customers, asked him to wait a minute,\r\nwhen she would show him his room, where he could clean himself. Should\r\nhe remain? He again felt hesitation, a discomfort which made him regret\r\nthe freedom of the open road, the hunger beneath the sun, endured with\r\nthe joy of being one\'s own master. It seemed to him that he had lived\r\nyears from his arrival on the pit-bank, in the midst of squalls, to\r\nthose hours passed under the earth on his belly in the black passages.\r\nAnd he shrank from beginning again; it was unjust and too hard. His\r\nman\'s pride revolted at the idea of becoming a crushed and blinded\r\nbeast.\r\n\r\nWhile \xc3\x89tienne was thus debating with himself, his eyes, wandering over\r\nthe immense plain, gradually began to see it clearly. He was surprised;\r\nhe had not imagined the horizon was like this, when old Bonnemort had\r\npointed it out to him in the darkness. Before him he plainly saw the\r\nVoreux in a fold of the earth, with its wood and brick buildings, the\r\ntarred screening-shed, the slate-covered steeple, the engine-room\r\nand the tall, pale red chimney, all massed together with that evil\r\nair. But around these buildings the space extended, and he had not\r\nimagined it so large, changed into an inky sea by the ascending waves\r\nof coal soot, bristling with high trestles which carried the rails of\r\nthe foot-bridges, encumbered in one corner with the timber supply,\r\nwhich looked like the harvest of a mown forest. Towards the right the\r\npit-bank hid the view, colossal as a barricade of giants, already\r\ncovered with grass in its older part, consumed at the other end by an\r\ninterior fire which had been burning for a year with a thick smoke,\r\nleaving at the surface in the midst of the pale grey of the slates and\r\nsandstones long trails of bleeding rust. Then the fields unrolled, the\r\nendless fields of wheat and beetroot, naked at this season of the year,\r\nmarshes with scanty vegetation, cut by a few stunted willows, distant\r\nmeadows separated by slender rows of poplars. Very far away little\r\npale patches indicated towns, Marchiennes to the north, Montsou to the\r\nsouth; while the forest of Vandame to the east bordered the horizon\r\nwith the violet line of its leafless trees. And beneath the livid sky,\r\nin the faint daylight of this winter afternoon, it seemed as if all the\r\nblackness of the Voreux, and all its flying coal dust, had fallen upon\r\nthe plain, powdering the trees, sanding the roads, sowing the earth.\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne looked, and what especially surprised him was a canal, the\r\ncanalized stream of the Scarpe, which he had not seen in the night.\r\nFrom the Voreux to Marchiennes this canal ran straight, like a dull\r\nsilver ribbon two leagues long, an avenue lined by large trees, raised\r\nabove the low earth, threading into space with the perspective of its\r\ngreen banks, its pale water into which glided the vermilion of the\r\nboats. Near one pit there was a wharf with moored vessels which were\r\nladen directly from the trams at the foot-bridges. Afterwards the canal\r\nmade a curve, sloping by the marshes; and the whole soul of that smooth\r\nplain appeared to lie in this geometrical stream, which traversed it\r\nlike a great road, carting coal and iron.\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne\'s glance went up from the canal to the settlement built on the\r\nheight, of which he could only distinguish the red tiles. Then his eyes\r\nrested again at the bottom of the clay slope, towards the Voreux, on\r\ntwo enormous masses of bricks made and burnt on the spot. A branch of\r\nthe Company\'s railroad passed behind a paling, for the use of the pit.\r\nThey must be sending down the last miners to the earth-cutting. Only\r\none shrill note came from a truck pushed by men. One felt no longer the\r\nunknown darkness, the inexplicable thunder, the flaming of mysterious\r\nstars. Afar, the blast furnaces and the coke kilns had paled with the\r\ndawn. There only remained, unceasingly, the escapement of the pump,\r\nalways breathing with the same thick, long breath, the ogre\'s breath of\r\nwhich he could now see the grey steam, and which nothing could satiate.\r\n\r\nThen \xc3\x89tienne suddenly made up his mind. Perhaps he seemed to see again\r\nCatherine\'s clear eyes, up there, at the entrance to the settlement.\r\nPerhaps, rather, it was the wind of revolt which came from the Voreux.\r\nHe did not know, but he wished to go down again to the mine, to suffer\r\nand to fight. And he thought fiercely of those people Bonnemort had\r\ntalked of, the crouching and sated god, to whom ten thousand starving\r\nmen gave their flesh without knowing it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART TWO\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Gr\xc3\xa9goires\' property, Piolaine, was situated two kilometres to the\r\neast of Montsou, on the Joiselle road. The house was a large square\r\nbuilding, without style, dating from the beginning of the last century.\r\nOf all the land that once belonged to it there only remained some\r\nthirty hectares, enclosed by walls, and easy to keep up. The orchard\r\nand kitchen garden especially were everywhere spoken of, being famous\r\nfor the finest fruit and vegetables in the country. For the rest, there\r\nwas no park, only a small wood. The avenue of old limes, a vault of\r\nfoliage three hundred metres long, reaching from the gate to the porch,\r\nwas one of the curiosities of this bare plain, on which one could count\r\nthe large trees between Marchiennes and Beaugnies.\r\n\r\nOn that morning the Gr\xc3\xa9goires got up at eight o\'clock. Usually they\r\nnever stirred until an hour later, being heavy sleepers; but last\r\nnight\'s tempest had disturbed them. And while her husband had gone\r\nat once to see if the wind had made any havoc, Madame Gr\xc3\xa9goire went\r\ndown to the kitchen in her slippers and flannel dressing-gown. She was\r\nshort and stout, about fifty-eight years of age, and retained a broad,\r\nsurprised, dollish face beneath the dazzling whiteness of her hair.\r\n\r\n"M\xc3\xa9lanie," she said to the cook, "suppose you were to make the brioche\r\nthis morning, since the dough is ready. Mademoiselle will not get up\r\nfor half an hour yet, and she can eat it with her chocolate. Eh? It\r\nwill be a surprise."\r\n\r\nThe cook, a lean old woman who had served them for thirty years,\r\nlaughed.\r\n\r\n"That\'s true! it will be a famous surprise. My stove is alight, and the\r\noven must be hot; and then Honorine can help me a bit."\r\n\r\nHonorine, a girl of some twenty years, who had been taken in as a\r\nchild and brought up in the house, now acted as housemaid. Besides\r\nthese two women, the only other servant was the coachman, Francis, who\r\nundertook the heavy work. A gardener and his wife were occupied with\r\nthe vegetables, the fruit, the flowers, and the poultry-yard. And as\r\nservice here was patriarchal, this little world lived together, like\r\none large family, on very good terms.\r\n\r\nMadame Gr\xc3\xa9goire, who had planned this surprise of the brioche in bed,\r\nwaited to see the dough put in the oven. The kitchen was very large,\r\nand one guessed it was the most important room in the house by its\r\nextreme cleanliness and by the arsenal of saucepans, utensils, and pots\r\nwhich filled it. It gave an impression of good feeding. Provisions\r\nabounded, hanging from hooks or in cupboards.\r\n\r\n"And let it be well glazed, won\'t you?" Madame Gr\xc3\xa9goire said as she\r\npassed into the dining-room.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the hot-air stove which warmed the whole house, a coal fire\r\nenlivened this room. In other respects it exhibited no luxury; a large\r\ntable, chairs, a mahogany sideboard; only two deep easy-chairs betrayed\r\na love of comfort, long happy hours of digestion. They never went into\r\nthe drawing-room, they remained here in a family circle.\r\n\r\nJust then M. Gr\xc3\xa9goire came back dressed in a thick fustian jacket; he\r\nalso was ruddy for his sixty years, with large, good-natured, honest\r\nfeatures beneath the snow of his curly hair. He had seen the coachman\r\nand the gardener; there had been no damage of importance, nothing but\r\na fallen chimney-pot. Every morning he liked to give a glance round\r\nPiolaine, which was not large enough to cause him anxiety, and from\r\nwhich he derived all the happiness of ownership.\r\n\r\n"And C\xc3\xa9cile?" he asked, "isn\'t she up yet then?"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t make it out," replied his wife. "I thought I heard her moving."\r\n\r\nThe table was set; there were three cups on the white cloth. They sent\r\nHonorine to see what had become of mademoiselle. But she came back\r\nimmediately, restraining her laughter, stifling her voice, as if she\r\nwere still upstairs in the bedroom.\r\n\r\n"Oh! if monsieur and madame could see mademoiselle! She sleeps; oh! she\r\nsleeps like an angel. One can\'t imagine it! It\'s a pleasure to look at\r\nher."\r\n\r\nThe father and mother exchanged tender looks. He said, smiling:\r\n\r\n"Will you come and see?"\r\n\r\n"The poor little darling!" she murmured. "I\'ll come."\r\n\r\nAnd they went up together. The room was the only luxurious one in the\r\nhouse. It was draped in blue silk, and the furniture was lacquered\r\nwhite, with blue tracery--a spoilt child\'s whim, which her parents had\r\ngratified. In the vague whiteness of the bed, beneath the half-light\r\nwhich came through a curtain that was drawn back, the young girl was\r\nsleeping with her cheek resting on her naked arm. She was not pretty,\r\ntoo healthy, in too vigorous condition, fully developed at eighteen;\r\nbut she had superb flesh, the freshness of milk, with her chestnut\r\nhair, her round face, and little willful nose lost between her cheeks.\r\nThe coverlet had slipped down, and she was breathing so softly that her\r\nrespiration did not even lift her already well-developed bosom.\r\n\r\n"That horrible wind must have prevented her from closing her eyes,"\r\nsaid the mother softly.\r\n\r\nThe father imposed silence with a gesture. Both of them leant down\r\nand gazed with adoration on this girl, in her virgin nakedness, whom\r\nthey had desired so long, and who had come so late, when they had no\r\nlonger hoped for her. They found her perfect, not at all too fat, and\r\ncould never feed her sufficiently. And she went on sleeping, without\r\nfeeling them near her, with their faces against hers. However, a slight\r\nmovement disturbed her motionless face. They feared that they would\r\nwake her, and went out on tiptoe.\r\n\r\n"Hush!" said M. Gr\xc3\xa9goire, at the door. "If she has not slept we must\r\nleave her sleeping."\r\n\r\n"As long as she likes, the darling!" agreed Madame Gr\xc3\xa9goire. "We will\r\nwait."\r\n\r\nThey went down and seated themselves in the easy-chairs in the\r\ndining-room; while the servants, laughing at mademoiselle\'s sound\r\nsleep, kept the chocolate on the stove without grumbling. He took up a\r\nnewspaper; she knitted at a large woollen quilt. It was very hot, and\r\nnot a sound was heard in the silent house.\r\n\r\nThe Gr\xc3\xa9goires\' fortune, about forty thousand francs a year, was\r\nentirely invested in a share of the Montsou mines. They would\r\ncomplacently narrate its origin, which dated from the very formation of\r\nthe Company.\r\n\r\nTowards the beginning of the last century, there had been a mad search\r\nfor coal between Lille and Valenciennes. The success of those who held\r\nthe concession, which was afterwards to become the Anzin Company, had\r\nturned all heads. In every commune the ground was tested; and societies\r\nwere formed and concessions grew up in a night. But among all the\r\nobstinate seekers of that epoch, Baron Desrumaux had certainly left\r\nthe reputation for the most heroic intelligence. For forty years he\r\nhad struggled without yielding, in the midst of continual obstacles:\r\nearly searches unsuccessful, new pits abandoned at the end of long\r\nmonths of work, landslips which filled up borings, sudden inundations\r\nwhich drowned the workmen, hundreds of thousands of francs thrown\r\ninto the earth; then the squabbles of the management, the panics of\r\nthe shareholders, the struggle with the lords of the soil, who were\r\nresolved not to recognize royal concessions if no treaty was first made\r\nwith themselves. He had at last founded the association of Desrumaux,\r\nFauquenoix and Co. to exploit the Montsou concession, and the pits\r\nbegan to yield a small profit when two neighbouring concessions, that\r\nof Cougny, belonging to the Comte de Cougny, and that of Joiselle,\r\nbelonging to the Cornille and Jenard Company, had nearly overwhelmed\r\nhim beneath the terrible assault of their competition. Happily, on the\r\n25th August 1760, a treaty was made between the three concessions,\r\nuniting them into a single one. The Montsou Mining Company was created,\r\nsuch as it still exists to-day. In the distribution they had divided\r\nthe total property, according to the standard of the money of the\r\ntime, into twenty-four sous, of which each was subdivided into twelve\r\ndeniers, which made two hundred and eighty-eight deniers; and as the\r\ndenier was worth ten thousand francs the capital represented a sum of\r\nnearly three millions. Desrumaux, dying but triumphant, received in\r\nthis division six sous and three deniers.\r\n\r\nIn those days the baron possessed Piolaine, which had three hundred\r\nhectares belonging to it, and he had in his service as steward Honor\xc3\xa9\r\nGr\xc3\xa9goire, a Picardy lad, the great-grandfather of L\xc3\xa9on Gr\xc3\xa9goire,\r\nC\xc3\xa9cile\'s father. When the Montsou treaty was made, Honor\xc3\xa9, who had\r\nlaid up savings to the amount of some fifty thousand francs, yielded\r\ntremblingly to his master\'s unshakable faith. He took out ten thousand\r\nfrancs in fine crowns, and took a denier, though with the fear of\r\nrobbing his children of that sum. His son Eug\xc3\xa9ne, in fact, received\r\nvery small dividends; and as he had become a bourgeois and had been\r\nfoolish enough to throw away the other forty thousand francs of the\r\npaternal inheritance in a company that came to grief, he lived meanly\r\nenough. But the interest of the denier gradually increased. The fortune\r\nbegan with F\xc3\xa9licien, who was able to realize a dream with which his\r\ngrandfather, the old steward, had nursed his childhood--the purchase\r\nof dismembered Piolaine, which he acquired as national property for\r\na ludicrous sum. However, bad years followed. It was necessary to\r\nawait the conclusion of the revolutionary catastrophes, and afterwards\r\nNapoleon\'s bloody fall; and it was L\xc3\xa9on Gr\xc3\xa9goire who profited at a\r\nstupefying rate of progress by the timid and uneasy investment of his\r\ngreat-grandfather. Those poor ten thousand francs grew and multiplied\r\nwith the Company\'s prosperity. From 1820 they had brought in one\r\nhundred per cent, ten thousand francs. In 1844 they had produced twenty\r\nthousand; in 1850, forty. During two years the dividend had reached the\r\nprodigious figure of fifty thousand francs; the value of the denier,\r\nquoted at the Lille bourse at a million, had centupled in a century.\r\n\r\nM. Gr\xc3\xa9goire, who had been advised to sell out when this figure of a\r\nmillion was reached, had refused with his smiling paternal air. Six\r\nmonths later an industrial crisis broke out; the denier fell to six\r\nhundred thousand francs. But he still smiled; he regretted nothing, for\r\nthe Gr\xc3\xa9goires had maintained an obstinate faith in their mine. It would\r\nrise again: God Himself was not so solid. Then with his religious faith\r\nwas mixed profound gratitude towards an investment which for a century\r\nhad supported the family in doing nothing. It was like a divinity of\r\ntheir own, whom their egoism surrounded with a kind of worship, the\r\nbenefactor of the hearth, lulling them in their great bed of idleness,\r\nfattening them at their gluttonous table. From father to son it had\r\ngone on. Why risk displeasing fate by doubting it? And at the bottom\r\nof their fidelity there was a superstitious terror, a fear lest the\r\nmillion of the denier might suddenly melt away if they were to realize\r\nit and to put it in a drawer. It seemed to them more sheltered in the\r\nearth, from which a race of miners, generations of starving people,\r\nextracted it for them, a little every day, as they needed it.\r\n\r\nFor the rest, happiness rained on this house. M. Gr\xc3\xa9goire, when very\r\nyoung, had married the daughter of a Marchiennes druggist, a plain,\r\npenniless girl, whom he adored, and who repaid him with happiness. She\r\nshut herself up in her household, and worshipped her husband, having\r\nno other will but his. No difference of tastes separated them, their\r\ndesires were mingled in one idea of comfort; and they had thus lived\r\nfor forty years, in affection and little mutual services. It was a\r\nwell-regulated existence; the forty thousand francs were spent quietly,\r\nand the savings expended on C\xc3\xa9cile, whose tardy birth had for a moment\r\ndisturbed the budget. They still satisfied all her whims--a second\r\nhorse, two more carriages, toilets sent from Paris. But they tasted in\r\nthis one more joy; they thought nothing too good for their daughter,\r\nalthough they had such a horror of display that they had preserved the\r\nfashions of their youth. Every unprofitable expense seemed foolish to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the door opened, and a loud voice called out:\r\n\r\n"Hallo! What now? Having breakfast without me!"\r\n\r\nIt was C\xc3\xa9cile, just come from her bed, her eyes heavy with sleep. She\r\nhad simply put up her hair and flung on a white woollen dressing-gown.\r\n\r\n"No, no!" said the mother; "you see we are all waiting. Eh? has the\r\nwind prevented you from sleeping, poor darling?"\r\n\r\nThe young girl looked at her in great surprise.\r\n\r\n"Has it been windy? I didn\'t know anything about it. I haven\'t moved\r\nall night."\r\n\r\nThen they thought this funny, and all three began to laugh; the\r\nservants who were bringing in the breakfast also broke out laughing,\r\nso amused was the household at the idea that mademoiselle had been\r\nsleeping for twelve hours right off. The sight of the brioche completed\r\nthe expansion of their faces.\r\n\r\n"What! Is it cooked, then?" said C\xc3\xa9cile; "that must be a surprise for\r\nme! That\'ll be good now, hot, with the chocolate!"\r\n\r\nThey sat down to table at last with the smoking chocolate in their\r\ncups, and for a long time talked of nothing but the brioche. M\xc3\xa9lanie\r\nand Honorine remained to give details about the cooking and watched\r\nthem stuffing themselves with greasy lips, saying that it was a\r\npleasure to make a cake when one saw the masters enjoying it so much.\r\n\r\nBut the dogs began to bark loudly; perhaps they announced the music\r\nmistress, who came from Marchiennes on Mondays and Fridays. A professor\r\nof literature also came. All the young girl\'s education was thus\r\ncarried on at Piolaine in happy ignorance, with her childish whims,\r\nthrowing the book out of the window as soon as anything wearied her.\r\n\r\n"It is M. Deneulin," said Honorine, returning.\r\n\r\nBehind her, Deneulin, a cousin of M. Gr\xc3\xa9goire\'s, appeared without\r\nceremony; with his loud voice, his quick gestures, he had the\r\nappearance of an old cavalry officer. Although over fifty, his short\r\nhair and thick moustache were as black as ink.\r\n\r\n"Yes! It is I. Good day! Don\'t disturb yourselves."\r\n\r\nHe had sat down amid the family\'s exclamations. They turned back at\r\nlast to their chocolate.\r\n\r\n"Have you anything to tell me?" asked M. Gr\xc3\xa9goire.\r\n\r\n"No! nothing at all," Deneulin hastened to reply. "I came out on\r\nhorseback to rub off the rust a bit, and as I passed your door I\r\nthought I would just look in."\r\n\r\nC\xc3\xa9cile questioned him about Jeanne and Lucie, his daughters. They\r\nwere perfectly well, the first was always at her painting, while the\r\nother, the elder, was training her voice at the piano from morning till\r\nnight. And there was a slight quiver in his voice, a disquiet which he\r\nconcealed beneath bursts of gaiety.\r\n\r\nM. Gr\xc3\xa9goire began again:\r\n\r\n"And everything goes well at the pit?"\r\n\r\n"Well, I am upset over this dirty crisis. Ah! we are paying for the\r\nprosperous years! They have built too many workshops, put down too many\r\nrailways, invested too much capital with a view to a large return, and\r\ntoday the money is asleep. They can\'t get any more to make the whole\r\nthing work. Luckily things are not desperate; I shall get out of it\r\nsomehow."\r\n\r\nLike his cousin he had inherited a denier in the Montsou mines. But\r\nbeing an enterprising engineer, tormented by the desire for a royal\r\nfortune, he had hastened to sell out when the denier had reached a\r\nmillion. For some months he had been maturing a scheme. His wife\r\npossessed, through an uncle, the little concession of Vandame, where\r\nonly two pits were open--Jean-Bart and Gaston-Marie--in an abandoned\r\nstate, and with such defective material that the output hardly covered\r\nthe cost. Now he was meditating the repair of Jean-Bart, the renewal\r\nof the engine, and the enlargement of the shaft so as to facilitate\r\nthe descent, keeping Gaston-Marie only for exhaustion purposes. They\r\nought to be able to shovel up gold there, he said. The idea was sound.\r\nOnly the million had been spent over it, and this damnable industrial\r\ncrisis broke out at the moment when large profits would have shown that\r\nhe was right. Besides, he was a bad manager, with a rough kindness\r\ntowards his workmen, and since his wife\'s death he allowed himself to\r\nbe pillaged, and also gave the rein to his daughters, the elder of whom\r\ntalked of going on the stage, while the younger had already had three\r\nlandscapes refused at the Salon, both of them joyous amid the downfall,\r\nand exhibiting in poverty their capacity for good household management.\r\n\r\n"You see, L\xc3\xa9on," he went on, in a hesitating voice, "you were wrong not\r\nto sell out at the same time as I did; now everything is going down.\r\nYou run risk, and if you had confided your money to me you would have\r\nseen what we should have done at Vandame in our mine!"\r\n\r\nM. Gr\xc3\xa9goire finished his chocolate without haste. He replied peacefully:\r\n\r\n"Never! You know that I don\'t want to speculate. I live quietly, and it\r\nwould be too foolish to worry my head over business affairs. And as for\r\nMontsou, it may continue to go down, we shall always get our living out\r\nof it. It doesn\'t do to be so diabolically greedy! Then, listen, it is\r\nyou who will bite your fingers one day, for Montsou will rise again and\r\nC\xc3\xa9cile\'s grandchildren will still get their white bread out of it."\r\n\r\nDeneulin listened with a constrained smile.\r\n\r\n"Then," he murmured, "if I were to ask you to put a hundred thousand\r\nfrancs in my affair you would refuse?"\r\n\r\nBut seeing the Gr\xc3\xa9goires\' disturbed faces he regretted having gone so\r\nfar; he put off his idea of a loan, reserving it until the case was\r\ndesperate.\r\n\r\n"Oh! I have not got to that! it is a joke. Good heavens! Perhaps you\r\nare right; the money that other people earn for you is the best to\r\nfatten on."\r\n\r\nThey changed the conversation. C\xc3\xa9cile spoke again of her cousins, whose\r\ntastes interested, while at the same time they shocked her. Madame\r\nGr\xc3\xa9goire promised to take her daughter to see those dear little ones on\r\nthe first fine day. M. Gr\xc3\xa9goire, however, with a distracted air, did\r\nnot follow the conversation. He added aloud:\r\n\r\n"If I were in your place I wouldn\'t persist any more; I would treat\r\nwith Montsou. They want it, and you will get your money back."\r\n\r\nHe alluded to an old hatred which existed between the concession\r\nof Montsou and that of Vandame. In spite of the latter\'s slight\r\nimportance, its powerful neighbour was enraged at seeing, enclosed\r\nwithin its own sixty-seven communes, this square league which did not\r\nbelong to it, and after having vainly tried to kill it had plotted to\r\nbuy it at a low price when in a failing condition. The war continued\r\nwithout truce. Each party stopped its galleries at two hundred metres\r\nfrom the other; it was a duel to the last drop of blood, although the\r\nmanagers and engineers maintained polite relations with each other.\r\n\r\nDeneulin\'s eyes had flamed up.\r\n\r\n"Never!" he cried, in his turn. "Montsou shall never have Vandame as\r\nlong as I am alive. I dined on Thursday at Hennebeau\'s, and I saw\r\nhim fluttering around me. Last autumn, when the big men came to the\r\nadministration building, they made me all sorts of advances. Yes, yes,\r\nI know them--those marquises, and dukes, and generals, and ministers!\r\nBrigands who would take away even your shirt at the corner of a wood."\r\n\r\nHe could not cease. Besides, M. Gr\xc3\xa9goire did not defend the\r\nadministration of Montsou--the six stewards established by the treaty\r\nof 1760, who governed the Company despotically, and the five survivors\r\nof whom on every death chose the new member among the powerful and rich\r\nshareholders. The opinion of the owner of Piolaine, with his reasonable\r\nideas, was that these gentlemen were sometimes rather immoderate in\r\ntheir exaggerated love of money.\r\n\r\nM\xc3\xa9lanie had come to clear away the table. Outside the dogs were again\r\nbarking, and Honorine was going to the door, when C\xc3\xa9cile, who was\r\nstifled by heat and food, left the table.\r\n\r\n"No, never mind! it must be for my lesson."\r\n\r\nDeneulin had also risen. He watched the young girl go out, and asked,\r\nsmiling:\r\n\r\n"Well! and the marriage with little N\xc3\xa9grel?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing has been settled," said Madame Gr\xc3\xa9goire; "it is only an idea.\r\nWe must reflect."\r\n\r\n"No doubt!" he went on, with a gay laugh. "I believe that the nephew\r\nand the aunt-- What baffles me is that Madame Hennebeau should throw\r\nherself so on C\xc3\xa9cile\'s neck."\r\n\r\nBut M. Gr\xc3\xa9goire was indignant. So distinguished a lady, and fourteen\r\nyears older than the young man! It was monstrous; he did not like\r\njoking on such subjects. Deneulin, still laughing, shook hands with him\r\nand left.\r\n\r\n"Not yet," said C\xc3\xa9cile, coming back. "It is that woman with the two\r\nchildren. You know, mamma, the miner\'s wife whom we met. Are they to\r\ncome in here?"\r\n\r\nThey hesitated. Were they very dirty? No, not very; and they would\r\nleave their sabots in the porch. Already the father and mother had\r\nstretched themselves out in the depths of their large easy-chairs. They\r\nwere digesting there. The fear of change of air decided them.\r\n\r\n"Let them come in, Honorine."\r\n\r\nThen Maheude and her little ones entered, frozen and hungry, seized\r\nby fright on finding themselves in this room, which was so warm and\r\nsmelled so nicely of the brioche.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nThe room remained shut up and the shutters had allowed gradual streaks\r\nof daylight to form a fan on the ceiling. The confined air stupefied\r\nthem so that they continued their night\'s slumber: L\xc3\xa9nore and Henri in\r\neach other\'s arms, Alzire with her head back, lying on her hump; while\r\nFather Bonnemort, having the bed of Zacharie and Jeanlin to himself,\r\nsnored with open mouth. No sound came from the closet where Maheude had\r\ngone to sleep again while suckling Estelle, her breast hanging to one\r\nside, the child lying across her belly, stuffed with milk, overcome\r\nalso and stifling in the soft flesh of the bosom.\r\n\r\nThe clock below struck six. Along the front of the settlement one heard\r\nthe sound of doors, then the clatter of sabots along the pavements; the\r\nscreening women were going to the pit. And silence again fell until\r\nseven o\'clock. Then shutters were drawn back, yawns and coughs were\r\nheard through the walls. For a long time a coffee-mill scraped, but no\r\none awoke in the room.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a sound of blows and shouts, far away, made Alzire sit up. She\r\nwas conscious of the time, and ran barefooted to shake her mother.\r\n\r\n"Mother, mother, it is late! you have to go out. Take care, you are\r\ncrushing Estelle."\r\n\r\nAnd she saved the child, half-stifled beneath the enormous mass of the\r\nbreasts.\r\n\r\n"Good gracious!" stammered Maheude, rubbing her eyes, "I\'m so knocked\r\nup I could sleep all day. Dress L\xc3\xa9nore and Henri, I\'ll take them with\r\nme; and you can take care of Estelle; I don\'t want to drag her along\r\nfor fear of hurting her, this dog\'s weather."\r\n\r\nShe hastily washed herself and put on an old blue skirt, her cleanest,\r\nand a loose jacket of grey wool in which she had made two patches the\r\nevening before.\r\n\r\n"And the soup! Good gracious!" she muttered again.\r\n\r\nWhen her mother had gone down, upsetting everything, Alzire went back\r\ninto the room taking with her Estelle, who had begun screaming. But\r\nshe was used to the little one\'s rages; at eight she had all a woman\'s\r\ntender cunning in soothing and amusing her. She gently placed her in\r\nher still warm bed, and put her to sleep again, giving her a finger\r\nto suck. It was time, for now another disturbance broke out, and she\r\nhad to make peace between L\xc3\xa9nore and Henri, who at last awoke. These\r\nchildren could never get on together; it was only when they were asleep\r\nthat they put their arms round one another\'s necks. The girl, who was\r\nsix years old, as soon as she was awake set on the boy, her junior\r\nby two years, who received her blows without returning them. Both of\r\nthem had the same kind of head, which was too large for them, as if\r\nblown out, with disorderly yellow hair. Alzire had to pull her sister\r\nby the legs, threatening to take the skin off her bottom. Then there\r\nwas stamping over the washing, and over every garment that she put\r\non to them. The shutters remained closed so as not to disturb Father\r\nBonnemort\'s sleep. He went on snoring amid the children\'s frightful\r\nclatter.\r\n\r\n"It\'s ready. Are you coming, up there?" shouted Maheude.\r\n\r\nShe had put back the blinds, and stirred up the fire, adding some coal\r\nto it. Her hope was that the old man had not swallowed all the soup.\r\nBut she found the saucepan dry, and cooked a handful of vermicelli\r\nwhich she had been keeping for three days in reserve. They could\r\nswallow it with water, without butter, as there could not be any\r\nremaining from the day before, and she was surprised to find that\r\nCatherine in preparing the bricks had performed the miracle of leaving\r\na piece as large as a nut. But this time the cupboard was indeed empty:\r\nnothing, not a crust, not an odd fragment, not a bone to gnaw. What was\r\nto become of them if Maigrat persisted in cutting short their credit,\r\nand if the Piolaine people would not give them the five francs? When\r\nthe men and the girl returned from the pit they would want to eat, for\r\nunfortunately it had not yet been found out how to live without eating.\r\n\r\n"Come down, will you?" she cried out, getting angry. "I ought to be\r\ngone by this!"\r\n\r\nWhen Alzire and the children were there she divided the vermicelli in\r\nthree small portions. She herself was not hungry, she said. Although\r\nCatherine had already poured water on the coffee-dregs of the day\r\nbefore, she did so over again, and swallowed two large glasses of\r\ncoffee so weak that it looked like rusty water. That would keep her up\r\nall the same.\r\n\r\n"Listen!" she repeated to Alzire. "You must let your grandfather sleep;\r\nyou must watch that Estelle does not knock her head; and if she wakes,\r\nor if she howls too much, here! take this bit of sugar and melt it and\r\ngive it her in spoonfuls. I know that you are sensible and won\'t eat it\r\nyourself."\r\n\r\n"And school, mother?"\r\n\r\n"School! well, that must be left for another day: I want you."\r\n\r\n"And the soup? would you like me to make it if you come back late?"\r\n\r\n"Soup, soup: no, wait till I come."\r\n\r\nAlzire, with the precocious intelligence of a little invalid girl,\r\ncould make soup very well. She must have understood, for she did not\r\ninsist. Now the whole settlement was awake, bands of children were\r\ngoing to school, and one heard the trailing noise of their clogs. Eight\r\no\'clock struck, and a growing murmur of chatter arose on the left,\r\namong the Levaque people. The women were commencing their day around\r\nthe coffee-pots, with their fists on their hips, their tongues turning\r\nwithout ceasing, like millstones. A faded head, with thick lips and\r\nflattened nose, was pressed against a window-pane, calling out:\r\n\r\n"Got some news. Stop a bit."\r\n\r\n"No, no! later on," replied Maheude. "I have to go out."\r\n\r\nAnd for fear of giving way to the offer of a glass of hot coffee she\r\npushed L\xc3\xa9nore and Henri, and set out with them. Up above, Father\r\nBonnemort was still snoring with a rhythmic snore which rocked the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nOutside, Maheude was surprised to find that the wind was no longer\r\nblowing. There had been a sudden thaw; the sky was earth-coloured,\r\nthe walls were sticky with greenish moisture, and the roads were\r\ncovered with pitch-like mud, a special kind of mud peculiar to the\r\ncoal country, as black as diluted soot, thick and tenacious enough\r\nto pull off her sabots. Suddenly she boxed L\xc3\xa9nore\'s ears, because\r\nthe little one amused herself by piling the mud on her clogs as on\r\nthe end of a shovel. On leaving the settlement she had gone along by\r\nthe pit-bank and followed the road of the canal, making a short cut\r\nthrough broken-up paths, across rough country shut in by mossy palings.\r\nSheds succeeded one another, long workshop buildings, tall chimneys\r\nspitting out soot, and soiling this ravaged suburb of an industrial\r\ndistrict. Behind a clump of poplars the old R\xc3\xa9quillart pit exhibited\r\nits crumbling steeple, of which the large skeleton alone stood upright.\r\nAnd turning to the right, Maheude found herself on the high road.\r\n\r\n"Stop, stop, dirty pig! I\'ll teach you to make mincemeat."\r\n\r\nNow it was Henri, who had taken a handful of mud and was moulding it.\r\nThe two children had their ears impartially boxed, and were brought\r\ninto good order, looking out of the corner of their eyes at the mud\r\npies they had made. They draggled along, already exhausted by their\r\nefforts to unstick their shoes at every step.\r\n\r\nOn the Marchiennes side the road unrolled its two leagues of pavement,\r\nwhich stretched straight as a ribbon soaked in cart grease between\r\nthe reddish fields. But on the other side it went winding down\r\nthrough Montsou, which was built on the slope of a large undulation\r\nin the plain. These roads in the Nord, drawn like a string between\r\nmanufacturing towns, with their slight curves, their slow ascents,\r\ngradually get lined with houses and tend to make the department one\r\nlaborious city. The little brick houses, daubed over to enliven the\r\nclimate, some yellow, others blue, others black--the last, no doubt,\r\nin order to reach at once their final shade--went serpentining down to\r\nright and to left to the bottom of the slope. A few large two-storied\r\nvillas, the dwellings of the heads of the workshops, made gaps in the\r\nserried line of narrow facades. A church, also of brick, looked like a\r\nnew model of a large furnace, with its square tower already stained by\r\nthe floating coal dust. And amid the sugar works, the rope works, and\r\nthe flour mills, there stood out ballrooms, restaurants, and beershops,\r\nwhich were so numerous that to every thousand houses there were more\r\nthan five hundred inns.\r\n\r\nAs she approached the Company\'s Yards, a vast series of storehouses and\r\nworkshops, Maheude decided to take Henri and L\xc3\xa9nore by the hand, one on\r\nthe right, the other on the left. Beyond was situated the house of the\r\ndirector, M. Hennebeau, a sort of vast chalet, separated from the road\r\nby a grating, and then a garden in which some lean trees vegetated.\r\nJust then, a carriage had stopped before the door and a gentleman\r\nwith decorations and a lady in a fur cloak alighted: visitors just\r\narrived from Paris at the Marchiennes station, for Madame Hennebeau,\r\nwho appeared in the shadow of the porch, was uttering exclamations of\r\nsurprise and joy.\r\n\r\n"Come along, then, dawdlers!" growled Maheude, pulling the two little\r\nones, who were standing in the mud.\r\n\r\nWhen she arrived at Maigrat\'s, she was quite excited. Maigrat lived\r\nclose to the manager; only a wall separated the latter\'s ground from\r\nhis own small house, and he had there a warehouse, a long building\r\nwhich opened on to the road as a shop without a front. He kept\r\neverything there, grocery, cooked meats, fruit, and sold bread, beer,\r\nand saucepans. Formerly an overseer at the Voreux, he had started with\r\na small canteen; then, thanks to the protection of his superiors, his\r\nbusiness had enlarged, gradually killing the Montsou retail trade. He\r\ncentralized merchandise, and the considerable custom of the settlements\r\nenabled him to sell more cheaply and to give longer credit. Besides, he\r\nhad remained in the Company\'s hands, and they had built his small house\r\nand his shop.\r\n\r\n"Here I am again, Monsieur Maigrat," said Maheude humbly, finding him\r\nstanding in front of his door.\r\n\r\nHe looked at her without replying. He was a stout, cold, polite man,\r\nand he prided himself on never changing his mind.\r\n\r\n"Now you won\'t send me away again, like yesterday. We must have bread\r\nfrom now to Saturday. Sure enough, we owe you sixty francs these two\r\nyears."\r\n\r\nShe explained in short, painful phrases. It was an old debt contracted\r\nduring the last strike. Twenty times over they had promised to settle\r\nit, but they had not been able; they could not even give him forty sous\r\na fortnight. And then a misfortune had happened two days before; she\r\nhad been obliged to pay twenty francs to a shoemaker who threatened to\r\nseize their things. And that was why they were without a sou. Otherwise\r\nthey would have been able to go on until Saturday, like the others.\r\n\r\nMaigrat, with protruded belly and folded arms, shook his head at every\r\nsupplication.\r\n\r\n"Only two loaves, Monsieur Maigrat. I am reasonable, I don\'t ask for\r\ncoffee. Only two three-pound loaves a day."\r\n\r\n"No," he shouted at last, at the top of his voice.\r\n\r\nHis wife had appeared, a pitiful creature who passed all her days\r\nover a ledger, without even daring to lift her head. She moved away,\r\nfrightened at seeing this unfortunate woman turning her ardent,\r\nbeseeching eyes towards her. It was said that she yielded the conjugal\r\nbed to the putters among the customers. It was a known fact that when\r\na miner wished to prolong his credit, he had only to send his daughter\r\nor his wife, plain or pretty, it mattered not, provided they were\r\ncomplaisant.\r\n\r\nMaheude, still imploring Maigrat with her look, felt herself\r\nuncomfortable under the pale keenness of his small eyes, which seemed\r\nto undress her. It made her angry; she would have understood before she\r\nhad had seven children, when she was young. And she went off, violently\r\ndragging L\xc3\xa9nore and Henri who were occupied in picking up nut-shells\r\nfrom the gutter where they were making investigations.\r\n\r\n"This won\'t bring you luck, Monsieur Maigrat, remember!"\r\n\r\nNow there only remained the Piolaine people. If these would not throw\r\nher a five-franc piece she might as well lie down and die. She had\r\ntaken the Joiselle road on the left. The administration building was\r\nthere at the corner of the road, a veritable brick palace, where\r\nthe great people from Paris, princes and generals and members of\r\nthe Government, came every autumn to give large dinners. As she\r\nwalked she was already spending the five francs, first bread, then\r\ncoffee, afterwards a quarter of butter, a bushel of potatoes for the\r\nmorning soup and the evening stew; finally, perhaps, a bit of pig\'s\r\nchitterlings, for the father needed meat.\r\n\r\nThe Cur\xc3\xa9 of Montsou, Abb\xc3\xa9 Joire, was passing, holding up his cassock,\r\nwith the delicate air of a fat, well-nourished cat afraid of wetting\r\nits fur. He was a mild man who pretended not to interest himself in\r\nanything, so as not to vex either the workers or the masters.\r\n\r\n"Good day, Monsieur le Cur\xc3\xa9."\r\n\r\nWithout stopping he smiled at the children, and left her planted in\r\nthe middle of the road. She was not religious, but she had suddenly\r\nimagined that this priest would give her something.\r\n\r\nAnd the journey began again through the black, sticky mud. There were\r\nstill two kilometres to walk, and the little ones dragged behind more\r\nthan ever, for they were frightened, and no longer amused themselves.\r\nTo right and to left of the path the same vague landscape unrolled,\r\nenclosed within mossy palings, the same factory buildings, dirty with\r\nsmoke, bristling with tall chimneys. Then the flat land was spread\r\nout in immense open fields, like an ocean of brown clods, without a\r\ntree-trunk, as far as the purplish line of the forest of Vandame.\r\n\r\n"Carry me, mother."\r\n\r\nShe carried them one after the other. Puddles made holes in the\r\npathway, and she pulled up her clothes, fearful of arriving too dirty.\r\nThree times she nearly fell, so sticky was that confounded pavement.\r\nAnd as they at last arrived before the porch, two enormous dogs threw\r\nthemselves upon them, barking so loudly that the little ones yelled\r\nwith terror. The coachman was obliged to take a whip to them.\r\n\r\n"Leave your sabots, and come in," repeated Honorine. In the dining-room\r\nthe mother and children stood motionless, dazed by the sudden heat, and\r\nvery constrained beneath the gaze of this old lady and gentleman, who\r\nwere stretched out in their easy-chairs.\r\n\r\n"C\xc3\xa9cile," said the old lady, "fulfil your little duties."\r\n\r\nThe Gr\xc3\xa9goires charged C\xc3\xa9cile with their charities. It was part of their\r\nidea of a good education. One must be charitable. They said themselves\r\nthat their house was the house of God. Besides, they flattered\r\nthemselves that they performed their charity with intelligence, and\r\nthey were exercised by a constant fear lest they should be deceived,\r\nand so encourage vice. So they never gave money, never! Not ten sous,\r\nnot two sous, for it is a well-known fact that as soon as a poor man\r\ngets two sous he drinks them. Their alms were, therefore, always in\r\nkind, especially in warm clothing, distributed during the winter to\r\nneedy children.\r\n\r\n"Oh! the poor dears!" exclaimed C\xc3\xa9cile, \'"how pale they are from the\r\ncold! Honorine, go and look for the parcel in the cupboard."\r\n\r\nThe servants were also gazing at these miserable creatures with the\r\npity and vague uneasiness of girls who are in no difficulty about their\r\nown dinners. While the housemaid went upstairs, the cook forgot her\r\nduties, leaving the rest of the brioche on the table, and stood there\r\nswinging her empty hands.\r\n\r\n"I still have two woollen dresses and some comforters," C\xc3\xa9cile went on;\r\n"you will see how warm they will be, the poor dears!"\r\n\r\nThen Maheude found her tongue, and stammered:\r\n\r\n"Thank you so much, mademoiselle. You are all too good."\r\n\r\nTears had filled her eyes, she thought herself sure of the five francs,\r\nand was only preoccupied by the way in which she would ask for them if\r\nthey were not offered to her. The housemaid did not reappear, and there\r\nwas a moment of embarrassed silence. From their mother\'s skirts the\r\nlittle ones opened their eyes wide and gazed at the brioche.\r\n\r\n"You only have these two?" asked Madame Gr\xc3\xa9goire, in order to break the\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n"Oh, madame! I have seven."\r\n\r\nM. Gr\xc3\xa9goire, who had gone back to his newspaper, sat up indignantly.\r\n\r\n"Seven children! But why? good God!"\r\n\r\n"It is imprudent," murmured the old lady.\r\n\r\nMaheude made a vague gesture of apology. What would you have? One\r\ndoesn\'t think about it at all, they come quite naturally. And then,\r\nwhen they grow up they bring something in, and that makes the household\r\ngo. Take their case, they could get on, if it was not for the\r\ngrandfather who was getting quite stiff, and if it was not that among\r\nthe lot only two of her sons and her eldest daughter were old enough\r\nto go down into the pit. It was necessary, all the same, to feed the\r\nlittle ones who brought nothing in.\r\n\r\n"Then," said Madame Gr\xc3\xa9goire, "you have worked for a long time at the\r\nmines?"\r\n\r\nA silent laugh lit up Maheude\'s pale face.\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes! ah, yes! I went down till I was twenty. The doctor said that\r\nI should stay down for good after I had been confined the second time,\r\nbecause it seems that made something go wrong in my inside. Besides,\r\nthen I got married, and I had enough to do in the house. But on my\r\nhusband\'s side, you see, they have been down there for ages. It goes\r\nup from grandfather to grandfather, one doesn\'t know how far back,\r\nquite to the beginning when they first took the pick down there at\r\nR\xc3\xa9quillart."\r\n\r\nM. Gr\xc3\xa9goire thoughtfully contemplated this woman and these pitiful\r\nchildren, with their waxy flesh, their discoloured hair, the\r\ndegeneration which stunted them, gnawed by anaemia, and with the\r\nmelancholy ugliness of starvelings. There was silence again, and one\r\nonly heard the burning coal as it gave out a jet of gas. The moist\r\nroom had that heavy air of comfort in which our middle-class nooks of\r\nhappiness slumber.\r\n\r\n"What is she doing, then?" exclaimed C\xc3\xa9cile impatiently. "M\xc3\xa9lanie, go\r\nup and tell her that the parcel is at the bottom of the cupboard, on\r\nthe left."\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, M. Gr\xc3\xa9goire repeated aloud the reflections inspired\r\nby the sight of these starving ones.\r\n\r\n"There is evil in this world, it is quite true; but, my good woman,\r\nit must also be said that workpeople are never prudent. Thus, instead\r\nof putting aside a few sous like our peasants, miners drink, get into\r\ndebt, and end by not having enough to support their families."\r\n\r\n"Monsieur is right," replied Maheude sturdily. "They don\'t always keep\r\nto the right path. That\'s what I\'m always saying to the ne\'er-do-wells\r\nwhen they complain. Now, I have been lucky; my husband doesn\'t drink.\r\nAll the same, on feast Sundays he sometimes takes a drop too much; but\r\nit never goes farther. It is all the nicer of him, since before our\r\nmarriage he drank like a hog, begging your pardon. And yet, you know,\r\nit doesn\'t help us much that he is so sensible. There are days like\r\nto-day when you might turn out all the drawers in the house and not\r\nfind a farthing."\r\n\r\nShe wished to suggest to them the idea of the five-franc piece, and\r\nwent on in her low voice, explaining the fatal debt, small at first,\r\nthen large and overwhelming. They paid regularly for many fortnights.\r\nBut one day they got behind, and then it was all up. They could never\r\ncatch up again. The gulf widened, and the men became disgusted with\r\nwork which did not even allow them to pay their way. Do what they\r\ncould, there was nothing but difficulties until death. Besides, it must\r\nbe understood that a collier needed a glass to wash away the dust.\r\nIt began there, and then he was always in the inn when worries came.\r\nWithout complaining of any one it might be that the workmen did not\r\nearn as much as they ought to.\r\n\r\n"I thought," said Madame Gr\xc3\xa9goire, "that the Company gave you lodging\r\nand firing?"\r\n\r\nMaheude glanced sideways at the flaming coal in the fireplace.\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, they give us coal, not very grand, but it burns. As to\r\nlodging, it only costs six francs a month; that sounds like nothing,\r\nbut it is often pretty hard to pay. To-day they might cut me up into\r\nbits without getting two sous out of me. Where there\'s nothing, there\'s\r\nnothing."\r\n\r\nThe lady and gentleman were silent, softly stretched out, and gradually\r\nwearied and disquieted by the exhibition of this wretchedness. She\r\nfeared she had wounded them, and added, with the stolid and just air of\r\na practical woman:\r\n\r\n"Oh! I didn\'t want to complain. Things are like this, and one has to\r\nput up with them; all the more that it\'s no good struggling, perhaps\r\nwe shouldn\'t change anything. The best is, is it not, to try and live\r\nhonestly in the place in which the good God has put us?"\r\n\r\nM. Gr\xc3\xa9goire approved this emphatically.\r\n\r\n"With such sentiments, my good woman, one is above misfortune."\r\n\r\nHonorine and M\xc3\xa9lanie at last brought the parcel.\r\n\r\nC\xc3\xa9cile unfastened it and took out the two dresses. She added\r\ncomforters, even stockings and mittens. They would all fit beautifully;\r\nshe hastened and made the servants wrap up the chosen garments; for her\r\nmusic mistress had just arrived; and she pushed the mother and children\r\ntowards the door.\r\n\r\n"We are very short," stammered Maheude; "if we only had a five-franc\r\npiece--"\r\n\r\nThe phrase was stifled, for the Maheus were proud and never begged.\r\nC\xc3\xa9cile looked uneasily at her father; but the latter refused\r\ndecisively, with an air of duty.\r\n\r\n"No, it is not our custom. We cannot do it."\r\n\r\nThen the young girl, moved by the mother\'s overwhelmed face, wished to\r\ndo all she could for the children. They were still looking fixedly at\r\nthe brioche; she cut it in two and gave it to them.\r\n\r\n"Here! this is for you."\r\n\r\nThen, taking the pieces back, she asked for an old newspaper:\r\n\r\n"Wait, you must share with your brothers and sisters."\r\n\r\nAnd beneath the tender gaze of her parents she finally pushed them out\r\nof the room. The poor starving urchins went off, holding the brioche\r\nrespectfully in their benumbed little hands.\r\n\r\nMaheude dragged her children along the road, seeing neither the desert\r\nfields, nor the black mud, nor the great livid sky. As she passed\r\nthrough Montsou she resolutely entered Maigrat\'s shop, and begged so\r\npersistently that at last she carried away two loaves, coffee, butter,\r\nand even her five-franc piece, for the man also lent money by the week.\r\nIt was not her that he wanted, it was Catherine; she understood that\r\nwhen he advised her to send her daughter for provisions. They would see\r\nabout that. Catherine would box his ears if he came too close under her\r\nnose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nEleven o\'clock struck at the little church in the Deux-Cent-Quarante\r\nsettlement, a brick chapel to which Abb\xc3\xa9 Joire came to say mass\r\non Sundays. In the school beside it, also of brick, one heard the\r\nfaltering voices of the children, in spite of windows closed against\r\nthe outside cold. The wide passages, divided into little gardens,\r\nback to back, between the four large blocks of uniform houses, were\r\ndeserted; and these gardens, devastated by the winter, exhibited\r\nthe destitution of their marly soil, lumped and spotted by the last\r\nvegetables. They were making soup, chimneys were smoking, a woman\r\nappeared at distant intervals along the fronts, opened a door and\r\ndisappeared. From one end to the other, on the pavement, the pipes\r\ndripped into tubs, although it was no longer raining, so charged was\r\nthis grey sky with moistness. And the village, built altogether in the\r\nmidst of the vast plain, and edged by its black roads as by a mourning\r\nborder, had no touch of joyousness about it save the regular bands of\r\nits red tiles, constantly washed by showers.\r\n\r\nWhen Maheude returned, she went out of her way to buy potatoes from\r\nan overseer\'s wife whose crop was not yet exhausted. Behind a curtain\r\nof sickly poplars, the only trees in these flat regions, was a group\r\nof isolated buildings, houses placed four together, and surrounded\r\nby their gardens. As the Company reserved this new experiment for\r\nthe captains, the workpeople called this corner of the hamlet the\r\nsettlement of the Bas-de-Soie, just as they called their own settlement\r\nPaie-tes-Dettes, in good-humoured irony of their wretchedness.\r\n\r\n"Eh! Here we are," said Maheude, laden with parcels, pushing in L\xc3\xa9nore\r\nand Henri, covered with mud and quite tired out.\r\n\r\nIn front of the fire Estelle was screaming, cradled in Alzire\'s arms.\r\nThe latter, having no more sugar and not knowing how to soothe her, had\r\ndecided to pretend to give her the breast. This ruse often succeeded.\r\nBut this time it was in vain for her to open her dress, and to press\r\nthe mouth against the lean breast of an eight-year-old invalid; the\r\nchild was enraged at biting the skin and drawing nothing.\r\n\r\n"Pass her to me," cried the mother as soon as she found herself free;\r\n"she won\'t let us say a word."\r\n\r\nWhen she had taken from her bodice a breast as heavy as a leather\r\nbottle, to the neck of which the brawler hung, suddenly silent, they\r\nwere at last able to talk. Otherwise everything was going on well; the\r\nlittle housekeeper had kept up the fire and had swept and arranged the\r\nroom. And in the silence they heard upstairs the grandfather\'s snoring,\r\nthe same rhythmic snoring which had not stopped for a moment.\r\n\r\n"What a lot of things!" murmured Alzire, smiling at the provisions. "If\r\nyou like, mother, I\'ll make the soup."\r\n\r\nThe table was encumbered: a parcel of clothes, two loaves, potatoes,\r\nbutter, coffee, chicory, and half a pound of pig\'s chitterlings.\r\n\r\n"Oh! the soup!" said Maheude with an air of fatigue. "We must gather\r\nsome sorrel and pull up some leeks. No! I will make some for the men\r\nafterwards. Put some potatoes on to boil; we\'ll eat them with a little\r\nbutter and some coffee, eh? Don\'t forget the coffee!"\r\n\r\nBut suddenly she thought of the brioche. She looked at the empty hands\r\nof L\xc3\xa9nore and Henri who were fighting on the floor, already rested and\r\nlively. These gluttons had slyly eaten the brioche on the road. She\r\nboxed their ears, while Alzire, who was putting the saucepan on the\r\nfire, tried to appease her.\r\n\r\n"Let them be, mother. If the brioche was for me, you know I don\'t mind\r\na bit. They were hungry, walking so far."\r\n\r\nMidday struck; they heard the clogs of the children coming out of\r\nschool. The potatoes were cooked, and the coffee, thickened by a good\r\nhalf of chicory, was passing through the percolator with a singing\r\nnoise of large drops. One corner of the table was free; but the mother\r\nonly was eating there. The three children were satisfied with their\r\nknees; and all the time the little boy with silent voracity looked,\r\nwithout saying anything, at the chitterlings, excited by the greasy\r\npaper.\r\n\r\nMaheude was drinking her coffee in little sips, with her hands round\r\nthe glass to warm them, when Father Bonnemort came down. Usually\r\nhe rose late, and his breakfast waited for him on the fire. But\r\nto-day he began to grumble because there was no soup. Then, when his\r\ndaughter-in-law said to him that one cannot always do what one likes,\r\nhe ate his potatoes in silence. From time to time he got up to spit in\r\nthe ashes for cleanliness, and, settled in his chair, he rolled his\r\nfood round in his mouth, with lowered head and dull eyes.\r\n\r\n"Ah! I forgot, mother," said Alzire. "The neighbour came--"\r\n\r\nHer mother interrupted her.\r\n\r\n"She bothers me!"\r\n\r\nThere was a deep rancour against the Levaque woman, who had pleaded\r\npoverty the day before to avoid lending her anything; while she knew\r\nthat she was just then in comfort, since her lodger, Bouteloup, had\r\npaid his fortnight in advance. In the settlement they did not usually\r\nlend from household to household.\r\n\r\n"Here! you remind me," said Maheude. "Wrap up a millful of coffee. I\r\nwill take it to Pierronne; I owe it her from the day before yesterday."\r\n\r\nAnd when her daughter had prepared the packet she added that she\r\nwould come back immediately to put the men\'s soup on the fire. Then\r\nshe went out with Estelle in her arms, leaving old Bonnemort to chew\r\nhis potatoes leisurely, while L\xc3\xa9nore and Henri fought for the fallen\r\nparings.\r\n\r\nInstead of going round, Maheude went straight across through the\r\ngardens, for fear lest Levaque\'s wife should call her. Her garden was\r\njust next to that of the Pierrons, and in the dilapidated trellis-work\r\nwhich separated them there was a hole through which they fraternized.\r\nThe common well was there, serving four households. Beside it, behind\r\na clump of feeble lilacs, was situated the shed, a low building full\r\nof old tools, in which were brought up the rabbits which were eaten on\r\nfeast days. One o\'clock struck; it was the hour for coffee, and not a\r\nsoul was to be seen at the doors or windows. Only a workman belonging\r\nto the earth-cutting, waiting the hour for descent, was digging up his\r\npatch of vegetable ground without raising his head. But as Maheude\r\narrived opposite the other block of buildings, she was surprised to see\r\na gentleman and two ladies in front of the church. She stopped a moment\r\nand recognized them; it was Madame Hennebeau bringing her guests,\r\nthe decorated gentleman and the lady in the fur mantle, to see the\r\nsettlement.\r\n\r\n"Oh! why did you take this trouble?" exclaimed Pierronne, when Maheude\r\nhad returned the coffee. "There was no hurry."\r\n\r\nShe was twenty-eight, and was considered the beauty of the settlement,\r\ndark, with a low forehead, large eyes, straight mouth, and coquettish\r\nas well; with the neatness of a cat, and with a good figure, for she\r\nhad had no children. Her mother, Brul\xc3\xa9, the widow of a pikeman who\r\ndied in the mine, after having sent her daughter to work in a factory,\r\nswearing that she should never marry a collier, had never ceased to be\r\nangry since she had married, somewhat late, Pierron, a widower with a\r\ngirl of eight. However, the household lived very happily, in the midst\r\nof chatter, of scandals which circulated concerning the husband\'s\r\ncomplaisance and the wife\'s lovers. No debts, meat twice a week, a\r\nhouse kept so clean that one could see oneself in the saucepans. As an\r\nadditional piece of luck, thanks to favours, the Company had authorized\r\nher to sell bon-bons and biscuits, jars of which she exhibited, on two\r\nboards, behind the window-panes. This was six or seven sous profit a\r\nday, and sometimes twelve on Sundays. The only drawback to all this\r\nhappiness was Mother Brul\xc3\xa9, who screamed with all the rage of an old\r\nrevolutionary, having to avenge the death of her man on the masters,\r\nand little Lydie, who pocketed, in the shape of frequent blows, the\r\npassions of the family.\r\n\r\n"How big she is already!" said Pierronne, simpering at Estelle.\r\n\r\n"Oh! the trouble that it gives! Don\'t talk of it!" said Maheude. "You\r\nare lucky not to have any. At least you can keep clean."\r\n\r\nAlthough everything was in order in her house, and she scrubbed every\r\nSaturday, she glanced with a jealous housekeeper\'s eye over this clean\r\nroom, in which there was even a certain coquetry, gilt vases on the\r\nsideboard, a mirror, three framed prints.\r\n\r\nPierronne was about to drink her coffee alone, all her people being at\r\nthe pit.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll have a glass with me?" she said.\r\n\r\n"No, thanks; I\'ve just swallowed mine."\r\n\r\n"What does that matter?"\r\n\r\nIn fact, it mattered nothing. And both began drinking slowly. Between\r\nthe jars of biscuits and bon-bons their eyes rested on the opposite\r\nhouses, of which the little curtains in the windows formed a row,\r\nrevealing by their greater or less whiteness the virtues of the\r\nhousekeepers. Those of the Levaques were very dirty, veritable kitchen\r\nclouts, which seemed to have wiped the bottoms of the saucepans.\r\n\r\n"How can they live in such dirt?" murmured Pierronne.\r\n\r\nThen Maheude began and did not stop. Ah! if she had had a lodger like\r\nthat Bouteloup she would have made the household go. When one knew how\r\nto do it, a lodger was an excellent thing. Only one ought not to sleep\r\nwith him. And then the husband had taken to drink, beat his wife, and\r\nran after the singers at the Montsou caf\xc3\xa9-concerts.\r\n\r\nPierronne assumed an air of profound disgust. These singers gave all\r\nsort of diseases. There was one at Joiselle who had infected a whole\r\npit.\r\n\r\n"What surprises me is that you let your son go with their girl."\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes! but just stop it then! Their garden is next to ours. Zacharie\r\nwas always there in summer with Philom\xc3\xa9ne behind the lilacs, and they\r\ndidn\'t put themselves out on the shed; one couldn\'t draw water at the\r\nwell without surprising them."\r\n\r\nIt was the usual history of the promiscuities of the settlement; boys\r\nand girls became corrupted together, throwing themselves on their\r\nbacksides, as they said, on the low, sloping roof of the shed when\r\ntwilight came on. All the putters got their first child there when they\r\ndid not take the trouble to go to R\xc3\xa9quillart or into the cornfields. It\r\nwas of no consequence; they married afterwards, only the mothers were\r\nangry when their lads began too soon, for a lad who married no longer\r\nbrought anything into the family.\r\n\r\n"In your place I would have done with it," said Pierronne, sensibly.\r\n"Your Zacharie has already filled her twice, and they will go on and\r\nget spliced. Anyhow, the money is gone."\r\n\r\nMaheude was furious and raised her hands.\r\n\r\n"Listen to this: I will curse them if they get spliced. Doesn\'t\r\nZacharie owe us any respect? He has cost us something, hasn\'t he? Very\r\nwell. He must return it before getting a wife to hang on him. What will\r\nbecome of us, eh, if our children begin at once to work for others?\r\nMight as well die!"\r\n\r\nHowever, she grew calm.\r\n\r\n"I\'m speaking in a general way; we shall see later. It is fine and\r\nstrong, your coffee; you make it proper."\r\n\r\nAnd after a quarter of an hour spent over other stories, she ran off,\r\nexclaiming that the men\'s soup was not yet made. Outside, the children\r\nwere going back to school; a few women were showing themselves at\r\ntheir doors, looking at Madame Hennebeau, who, with lifted finger, was\r\nexplaining the settlement to her guests. This visit began to stir up\r\nthe village. The earth-cutting man stopped digging for a moment, and\r\ntwo disturbed fowls took fright in the gardens.\r\n\r\nAs Maheude returned, she ran against the Levaque woman who had come out\r\nto stop Dr. Vanderhaghen, a doctor of the Company, a small hurried man,\r\noverwhelmed by work, who gave his advice as he walked.\r\n\r\n"Sir," she said, "I can\'t sleep; I feel ill everywhere. I must tell you\r\nabout it."\r\n\r\nHe spoke to them all familiarly, and replied without stopping:\r\n\r\n"Just leave me alone; you drink too much coffee."\r\n\r\n"And my husband, sir," said Maheude in her turn, "you must come and see\r\nhim. He always has those pains in his legs."\r\n\r\n"It is you who take too much out of him. Just leave me alone!"\r\n\r\nThe two women were left to gaze at the doctor\'s retreating back.\r\n\r\n"Come in, then," said the Levaque woman, when she had exchanged a\r\ndespairing shrug with her neighbour. "You know, there is something new.\r\nAnd you will take a little coffee. It is quite fresh."\r\n\r\nMaheude refused, but without energy. Well! a drop, at all events, not\r\nto disoblige. And she entered.\r\n\r\nThe room was black with dirt, the floor and the walls spotted with\r\ngrease, the sideboard and the table sticky with filth; and the stink\r\nof a badly kept house took you by the throat. Near the fire, with his\r\nelbows on the table and his nose in his plate, Bouteloup, a broad stout\r\nplacid man, still young for thirty-five, was finishing the remains\r\nof his boiled beef, while standing in front of him, little Achille,\r\nPhilom\xc3\xa9ne\'s first-born, who was already in his third year, was looking\r\nat him in the silent, supplicating way of a gluttonous animal. The\r\nlodger, very kind behind his big brown beard, from time to time stuffed\r\na piece of meat into his mouth.\r\n\r\n"Wait till I sugar it," said the Levaque woman, putting some brown\r\nsugar beforehand into the coffee-pot.\r\n\r\nSix years older than he was, she was hideous and worn out, with her\r\nbosom hanging on her belly, and her belly on her thighs, with a\r\nflattened muzzle, and greyish hair always uncombed. He had taken her\r\nnaturally, without choosing, the same as he did his soup in which he\r\nfound hairs, or his bed of which the sheets lasted for three months.\r\nShe was part of the lodging; the husband liked repeating that good\r\nreckonings make good friends.\r\n\r\n"I was going to tell you," she went on, "that Pierronne was seen\r\nyesterday prowling about on the Bas-de-Soie side. The gentleman you\r\nknow of was waiting for her behind Rasseneur\'s, and they went off\r\ntogether along the canal. Eh! that\'s nice, isn\'t it? A married woman!"\r\n\r\n"Gracious!" said Maheude; "Pierron, before marrying her, used to give\r\nthe captain rabbits; now it costs him less to lend his wife."\r\n\r\nBouteloup began to laugh enormously, and threw a fragment of sauced\r\nbread into Achille\'s mouth. The two women went on relieving themselves\r\nwith regard to Pierronne--a flirt, no prettier than any one else, but\r\nalways occupied in looking after every freckle of her skin, in washing\r\nherself, and putting on pomade. Anyhow, it was the husband\'s affair,\r\nif he liked that sort of thing. There were men so ambitious that they\r\nwould wipe the masters\' behinds to hear them say thank you. And they\r\nwere only interrupted by the arrival of a neighbour bringing in a\r\nlittle urchin of nine months, D\xc3\xa9sir\xc3\xa9e, Philom\xc3\xa9ne\'s youngest; Philom\xc3\xa9ne,\r\ntaking her breakfast at the screening-shed, had arranged that they\r\nshould bring her little one down there, where she suckled it, seated\r\nfor a moment in the coal.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t leave mine for a moment, she screams directly," said Maheude,\r\nlooking at Estelle, who was asleep in her arms.\r\n\r\nBut she did not succeed in avoiding the domestic affair which she had\r\nread in the other\'s eyes.\r\n\r\n"I say, now we ought to get that settled."\r\n\r\nAt first the two mothers, without need for talking about it, had agreed\r\nnot to conclude the marriage. If Zacharie\'s mother wished to get her\r\nson\'s wages as long as possible, Philom\xc3\xa9ne\'s mother was enraged at the\r\nidea of abandoning her daughter\'s wages. There was no hurry; the second\r\nmother had even preferred to keep the little one, as long as there was\r\nonly one; but when it began to grow and eat and another one came, she\r\nfound that she was losing, and furiously pushed on the marriage, like a\r\nwoman who does not care to throw away her money.\r\n\r\n"Zacharie has drawn his lot," she went on, "and there\'s nothing in the\r\nway. When shall it be?"\r\n\r\n"Wait till the fine weather," replied Maheude, constrainedly. "They\r\nare a nuisance, these affairs! As if they couldn\'t wait to be married\r\nbefore going together! My word! I would strangle Catherine if I knew\r\nthat she had done that."\r\n\r\nThe other woman shrugged her shoulders.\r\n\r\n"Let be! she\'ll do like the others."\r\n\r\nBouteloup, with the tranquillity of a man who is at home, searched\r\nabout on the dresser for bread. Vegetables for Levaque\'s soup, potatoes\r\nand leeks, lay about on a corner of the table, half-peeled, taken up\r\nand dropped a dozen times in the midst of continual gossiping. The\r\nwoman was about to go on with them again when she dropped them anew and\r\nplanted herself before the window.\r\n\r\n"What\'s that there? Why, there\'s Madame Hennebeau with some people.\r\nThey are going into Pierronne\'s."\r\n\r\nAt once both of them started again on the subject of Pierronne. Oh!\r\nwhenever the Company brought any visitors to the settlement they never\r\nfailed to go straight to her place, because it was clean. No doubt\r\nthey never told them stories about the head captain. One can afford to\r\nbe clean when one has lovers who earn three thousand francs, and are\r\nlodged and warmed, without counting presents. If it was clean above it\r\nwas not clean underneath. And all the time that the visitors remained\r\nopposite, they went on chattering.\r\n\r\n"There, they are coming out," said the Levaque woman at last. "They are\r\ngoing all around. Why, look, my dear--I believe they are going into\r\nyour place."\r\n\r\nMaheude was seized with fear. Who knows whether Alzire had sponged over\r\nthe table? And her soup, also, which was not yet ready! She stammered a\r\ngood-day, and ran off home without a single glance aside.\r\n\r\nBut everything was bright. Alzire, very seriously, with a cloth in\r\nfront of her, had set about making the soup, seeing that her mother did\r\nnot return. She had pulled up the last leeks from the garden, gathered\r\nthe sorrel, and was just then cleaning the vegetables, while a large\r\nkettle on the fire was heating the water for the men\'s baths when they\r\nshould return. Henri and L\xc3\xa9nore were good for once, being absorbed in\r\ntearing up an old almanac. Father Bonnemort was smoking his pipe in\r\nsilence. As Maheude was getting her breath Madame Hennebeau knocked.\r\n\r\n"You will allow me, will you not, my good woman?"\r\n\r\nTall and fair, a little heavy in her superb maturity of forty\r\nyears, she smiled with an effort of affability, without showing too\r\nprominently her fear of soiling her bronze silk dress and black velvet\r\nmantle.\r\n\r\n"Come in, come in," she said to her guests. "We are not disturbing\r\nany one. Now, isn\'t this clean again! And this good woman has seven\r\nchildren! All our households are like this. I ought to explain to you\r\nthat the Company rents them the house at six francs a month. A large\r\nroom on the ground floor, two rooms above, a cellar, and a garden."\r\n\r\nThe decorated gentleman and the lady in the fur cloak, arrived that\r\nmorning by train from Paris, opened their eyes vaguely, exhibiting on\r\ntheir faces their astonishment at all these new things which took them\r\nout of their element.\r\n\r\n"And a garden!" repeated the lady. "One could live here! It is\r\ncharming!"\r\n\r\n"We give them more coal than they can burn," went on Madame Hennebeau.\r\n"A doctor visits them twice a week; and when they are old they receive\r\npensions, although nothing is held back from their wages."\r\n\r\n"A Thebaid! a real land of milk and honey!" murmured the gentleman in\r\ndelight.\r\n\r\nMaheude had hastened to offer chairs. The ladies refused. Madame\r\nHennebeau was already getting tired, happy for a moment to amuse\r\nherself in the weariness of her exile by playing the part of exhibiting\r\nthe beasts, but immediately disgusted by the sickly odour of\r\nwretchedness, in spite of the special cleanliness of the houses into\r\nwhich she ventured. Besides, she was only repeating odd phrases which\r\nshe had overheard, without ever troubling herself further about this\r\nrace of workpeople who were labouring and suffering beside her.\r\n\r\n"What beautiful children!" murmured the lady, who thought them hideous,\r\nwith their large heads beneath their bushy, straw-coloured hair.\r\n\r\nAnd Maheude had to tell their ages; they also asked her questions about\r\nEstelle, out of politeness. Father Bonnemort respectfully took his pipe\r\nout of his mouth; but he was not the less a subject of uneasiness, so\r\nworn out by his forty years underground, with his stiff limbs, deformed\r\nbody, and earthy face; and as a violent spasm of coughing took him\r\nhe preferred to go and spit outside, with the idea that his black\r\nexpectoration would make people uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nAlzire received all the compliments. What an excellent little\r\nhousekeeper, with her cloth! They congratulated the mother on having a\r\nlittle daughter so sensible for her age. And none spoke of the hump,\r\nthough looks of uneasy compassion were constantly turned towards the\r\npoor little invalid.\r\n\r\n"Now!" concluded Madame Hennebeau, "if they ask you about our\r\nsettlements at Paris you will know what to reply. Never more noise than\r\nthis, patriarchal manners, all happy and well off as you see, a place\r\nwhere you might come to recruit a little, on account of the good air\r\nand the tranquillity."\r\n\r\n"It is marvellous, marvellous!" exclaimed the gentleman, in a final\r\noutburst of enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nThey left with that enchanted air with which people leave a booth in\r\na fair, and Maheude, who accompanied them, remained on the threshold\r\nwhile they went away slowly, talking very loudly. The streets were\r\nfull of people, and they had to pass through several groups of women,\r\nattracted by the news of their visit, which was hawked from house to\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nJust then, Levaque, in front of her door, had stopped Pierronne, who\r\nwas drawn by curiosity. Both of them affected a painful surprise. What\r\nnow? Were these people going to bed at the Maheus\'? But it was not so\r\nvery delightful a place.\r\n\r\n"Always without a sou, with all that they earn! Lord! when people have\r\nvices!"\r\n\r\n"I have just heard that she went this morning to beg at Piolaine, and\r\nMaigrat, who had refused them bread, has given them something. We know\r\nhow Maigrat pays himself!"\r\n\r\n"On her? Oh, no! that would need some courage. It\'s Catherine that he\'s\r\nafter."\r\n\r\n"Why, didn\'t she have the cheek to say just now that she would strangle\r\nCatherine if she were to come to that? As if big Chaval for ever so\r\nlong had not put her backside on the shed!"\r\n\r\n"Hush! here they are!"\r\n\r\nThen Levaque and Pierronne, with a peaceful air and without impolite\r\ncuriosity, contented themselves with watching the visitors out of the\r\ncorners of their eyes. Then by a gesture they quickly called Maheude,\r\nwho was still carrying Estelle in her arms. And all three, motionless,\r\nwatched the well-clad backs of Madame Hennebeau and her guests slowly\r\ndisappear. When they were some thirty paces off, the gossiping\r\nrecommenced with redoubled vigour.\r\n\r\n"They carry plenty of money on their skins; worth more than themselves,\r\nperhaps."\r\n\r\n"Ah, sure! I don\'t know the other, but the one that belongs here, I\r\nwouldn\'t give four sous for her, big as she is. They do tell stories--"\r\n\r\n"Eh? What stories?"\r\n\r\n"Why, she has men! First, the engineer."\r\n\r\n"That lean, little creature! Oh, he\'s too small! She would lose him in\r\nthe sheets."\r\n\r\n"What does that matter, if it amuses her? I don\'t trust a woman who\r\nputs on such proud airs and never seems to be pleased where she is.\r\nJust look how she wags her rump, as if she felt contempt for us all. Is\r\nthat nice?"\r\n\r\nThe visitors went along at the same slow pace, still talking, when a\r\ncarriage stopped in the road, before the church. A gentleman of about\r\nforty-eight got out of it, dressed in a black frock-coat, and with a\r\nvery dark complexion and an authoritative, correct expression.\r\n\r\n"The husband," murmured Levaque, lowering her voice, as if he could\r\nhear her, seized by that hierarchical fear which the manager inspired\r\nin his ten thousand workpeople. "It\'s true, though, that he has a\r\ncuckold\'s head, that man."\r\n\r\nNow the whole settlement was out of doors. The curiosity of the women\r\nincreased. The groups approached each other, and were melted into one\r\ncrowd; while bands of urchins, with unwiped noses and gaping mouths,\r\ndawdled along the pavements. For a moment the schoolmaster\'s pale head\r\nwas also seen behind the school-house hedge. Among the gardens, the\r\nman who was digging stood with one foot on his spade, and with rounded\r\neyes. And the murmur of gossiping gradually increased, with a sound of\r\nrattles, like a gust of wind among dry leaves.\r\n\r\nIt was especially before the Levaques\' door that the crowd was\r\nthickest. Two women had come forward, then ten, then twenty. Pierronne\r\nwas prudently silent now that there were too many ears about. Maheude,\r\none of the more reasonable, also contented herself with looking on;\r\nand to calm Estelle, who was awake and screaming, she had tranquilly\r\ndrawn out her suckling animal\'s breast, which hung swaying as if pulled\r\ndown by the continual running of its milk. When M. Hennebeau had\r\nseated the ladies in the carriage, which went off in the direction of\r\nMarchiennes, there was a final explosion of clattering voices, all the\r\nwomen gesticulating and talking in each other\'s faces in the midst of a\r\ntumult as of an ant-hill in revolution.\r\n\r\nBut three o\'clock struck. The workers of the earth-cutting, Bouteloup\r\nand the others, had set out. Suddenly around the church appeared\r\nthe first colliers returning from the pit with black faces and damp\r\ngarments, folding their arms and expanding their backs. Then there was\r\nconfusion among the women: they all began to run home with the terror\r\nof housekeepers who had been led astray by too much coffee and too much\r\ntattle, and one heard nothing more than this restless cry, pregnant\r\nwith quarrels:\r\n\r\n"Good Lord, and my soup! and my soup which isn\'t ready!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Maheu came in after having left \xc3\x89tienne at Rasseneur\'s, he found\r\nCatherine, Zacharie, and Jeanlin seated at the table finishing their\r\nsoup. On returning from the pit they were always so hungry that they\r\nate in their damp clothes, without even cleaning themselves; and no one\r\nwas waited for, the table was laid from morning to night; there was\r\nalways someone there swallowing his portion, according to the chances\r\nof work.\r\n\r\nAs he entered the door Maheu saw the provisions. He said nothing,\r\nbut his uneasy face lighted up. All the morning the emptiness of the\r\ncupboard, the thought of the house without coffee and without butter,\r\nhad been troubling him; the recollection came to him painfully while he\r\nwas hammering at the seam, stifled at the bottom of the cutting. What\r\nwould his wife do, and what would become of them if she were to return\r\nwith empty hands? And now, here was everything! She would tell him\r\nabout it later on. He laughed with satisfaction.\r\n\r\nCatherine and Jeanlin had risen, and were taking their coffee standing;\r\nwhile Zacharie, not filled with the soup, cut himself a large slice of\r\nbread and covered it with butter. Although he saw the chitterlings on\r\na plate he did not touch them, for meat was for the father, when there\r\nwas only enough for one. All of them had washed down their soup with a\r\nbig bumper of fresh water, the good, clear drink of the fortnight\'s end.\r\n\r\n"I have no beer," said Maheude, when the father had seated himself in\r\nhis turn. "I wanted to keep a little money. But if you would like some\r\nthe little one can go and fetch a pint."\r\n\r\nHe looked at her in astonishment. What! she had money, too!\r\n\r\n"No, no," he said, "I\'ve had a glass, it\'s all right."\r\n\r\nAnd Maheu began to swallow by slow spoonfuls the paste of bread,\r\npotatoes, leeks, and sorrel piled up in the bowl which served him as a\r\nplate. Maheude, without putting Estelle down, helped Alzire to give him\r\nall that he required, pushed near him the butter and the meat, and put\r\nhis coffee on the fire to keep it quite hot.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, beside the fire, they began to wash themselves in\r\nthe half of a barrel transformed into a tub. Catherine, whose turn\r\ncame first, had filled it with warm water; and she undressed herself\r\ntranquilly, took off her cap, her jacket, her breeches, and even her\r\nchemise, habituated to this since the age of eight, having grown up\r\nwithout seeing any harm in it. She only turned with her stomach to the\r\nfire, then rubbed herself vigorously with black soap. No one looked\r\nat her, even L\xc3\xa9nore and Henri were no longer inquisitive to see how\r\nshe was made. When she was clean she went up the stairs quite naked,\r\nleaving her damp chemise and other garments in a heap on the floor. But\r\na quarrel broke out between the two brothers: Jeanlin had hastened to\r\njump into the tub under the pretence that Zacharie was still eating;\r\nand the latter hustled him, claiming his turn, and calling out that he\r\nwas polite enough to allow Catherine to wash herself first, but he did\r\nnot wish to have the rinsings of the young urchins, all the less since,\r\nwhen Jeanlin had been in, it would do to fill the school ink-pots. They\r\nended by washing themselves together, also turning towards the fire,\r\nand they even helped each other, rubbing one another\'s backs. Then,\r\nlike their sister, they disappeared up the staircase naked.\r\n\r\n"What a slop they do make!" murmured Maheude, taking up their garments\r\nfrom the floor to put them to dry. "Alzire, just sponge up a bit."\r\n\r\nBut a disturbance on the other side of the wall cut short her speech.\r\nOne heard a man\'s oaths, a woman\'s crying, a whole stampede of battle,\r\nwith hollow blows that sounded like the shock of an empty gourd.\r\n\r\n"Levaque\'s wife is catching it," Maheu peacefully stated as he scraped\r\nthe bottom of his bowl with the spoon. "It\'s queer; Bouteloup made out\r\nthat the soup was ready."\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes! ready," said Maheude. "I saw the vegetables on the table, not\r\neven cleaned."\r\n\r\nThe cries redoubled, and there was a terrible push which shook the\r\nwall, followed by complete silence. Then the miner, swallowing the last\r\nspoonful, concluded, with an air of calm justice:\r\n\r\n"If the soup is not ready, one can understand."\r\n\r\nAnd after having drunk a glassful of water, he attacked the\r\nchitterlings. He cut square pieces, stuck the point of his knife into\r\nthem and ate them on his bread without a fork. There was no talking\r\nwhen the father was eating. He himself was hungry in silence; he did\r\nnot recognize the usual taste of Maigrat\'s provisions; this must come\r\nfrom somewhere else; however, he put no question to his wife. He only\r\nasked if the old man was still sleeping upstairs. No, the grandfather\r\nhad gone out for his usual walk. And there was silence again.\r\n\r\nBut the odour of the meat made L\xc3\xa9nore and Henri lift up their heads\r\nfrom the floor, where they were amusing themselves with making rivulets\r\nwith the spilt water. Both of them came and planted themselves near\r\ntheir father, the little one in front. Their eyes followed each\r\nmorsel, full of hope when it set out from the plate and with an air of\r\nconsternation when it was engulfed in the mouth. At last the father\r\nnoticed the gluttonous desire which made their faces pale and their\r\nlips moist.\r\n\r\n"Have the children had any of it?" he asked.\r\n\r\nAnd as his wife hesitated:\r\n\r\n"You know I don\'t like injustice. It takes away my appetite when I see\r\nthem there, begging for bits."\r\n\r\n"But they\'ve had some of it," she exclaimed, angrily. "If you were to\r\nlisten to them you might give them your share and the others\', too;\r\nthey would fill themselves till they burst. Isn\'t it true, Alzire, that\r\nwe have all had some?"\r\n\r\n"Sure enough, mother," replied the little humpback, who under such\r\ncircumstances could tell lies with the self-possession of a grown-up\r\nperson.\r\n\r\nL\xc3\xa9nore and Henri stood motionless, shocked and rebellious at such\r\nlying, when they themselves were whipped if they did not tell the\r\ntruth. Their little hearts began to swell, and they longed to protest,\r\nand to say that they, at all events, were not there when the others had\r\nsome.\r\n\r\n"Get along with you," said the mother, driving them to the other end\r\nof the room. "You ought to be ashamed of being always in your father\'s\r\nplate; and even if he was the only one to have any, doesn\'t he work,\r\nwhile all you, a lot of good-for-nothings, can\'t do anything but spend!\r\nYes, and the more the bigger you are."\r\n\r\nMaheu called them back. He seated L\xc3\xa9nore on his left thigh, Henri on\r\nthe right; then he finished the chitterlings by playing at dinner\r\nwith them. He cut small pieces, and each had his share. The children\r\ndevoured with delight.\r\n\r\nWhen he had finished, he said to his wife:\r\n\r\n"No, don\'t give me my coffee. I\'m going to wash first; and just give me\r\na hand to throw away this dirty water."\r\n\r\nThey took hold of the handles of the tub and emptied it into the gutter\r\nbefore the door, when Jeanlin came down in dry garments, breeches and\r\na woollen blouse, too large for him, which were weary of fading on his\r\nbrother\'s back. Seeing him slinking out through the open door, his\r\nmother stopped him.\r\n\r\n"Where are you off to?"\r\n\r\n"Over there."\r\n\r\n"Over where? Listen to me. You go and gather a dandelion salad for this\r\nevening. Eh, do you hear? If you don\'t bring a salad back you\'ll have\r\nto deal with me."\r\n\r\n"All right!"\r\n\r\nJeanlin set out with hands in his pockets, trailing his sabots and\r\nslouching along, with his slender loins of a ten-year-old urchin, like\r\nan old miner. In his turn, Zacharie came down, more carefully dressed,\r\nhis body covered by a black woollen knitted jacket with blue stripes.\r\nHis father called out to him not to return late; and he left, nodding\r\nhis head with his pipe between his teeth, without replying. Again the\r\ntub was filled with warm water. Maheu was already slowly taking off his\r\njacket. At a look, Alzire led L\xc3\xa9nore and Henri outside to play. The\r\nfather did not like washing _en famille_, as was practised in many\r\nhouses in the settlement. He blamed no one, however; he simply said\r\nthat it was good for the children to dabble together.\r\n\r\n"What are you doing up there?" cried Maheude, up the staircase.\r\n\r\n"I\'m mending my dress that I tore yesterday," replied Catherine.\r\n\r\n"All right. Don\'t come down, your father is washing."\r\n\r\nThen Maheu and Maheude were left alone. The latter decided to place\r\nEstelle on a chair, and by a miracle, finding herself near the fire the\r\nchild did not scream, but turned towards her parents the vague eyes of\r\na little creature without intelligence. He was crouching before the tub\r\nquite naked, having first plunged his head into it, well rubbed with\r\nthat black soap the constant use of which discoloured and made yellow\r\nthe hair of the race. Afterwards he got into the water, lathered his\r\nchest, belly, arms, and thighs, scraping them energetically with both\r\nfists. His wife, standing by, watched him.\r\n\r\n"Well, then," she began, "I saw your eyes when you came in. You were\r\nbothered, eh? and it eased you, those provisions. Fancy! those Piolaine\r\npeople didn\'t give me a sou! Oh! they are kind enough; they have\r\ndressed the little ones and I was ashamed to ask them, for it crosses\r\nme to ask for things."\r\n\r\nShe interrupted herself a moment to wedge Estelle into the chair lest\r\nshe should tip over. The father continued to work away at his skin,\r\nwithout hastening by a question this story which interested him,\r\npatiently waiting for light.\r\n\r\n"I must tell you that Maigrat had refused me, oh! straight! like one\r\nkicks a dog out of doors. Guess if I was on a spree! They keep you\r\nwarm, woollen garments, but they don\'t put anything into your stomach,\r\neh!"\r\n\r\nHe lifted his head, still silent. Nothing at Piolaine, nothing at\r\nMaigrat\'s: then where? But, as usual, she was pulling up her sleeves to\r\nwash his back and those parts which he could not himself easily reach.\r\nBesides, he liked her to soap him, to rub him everywhere till she\r\nalmost broke her wrists. She took soap and worked away at his shoulders\r\nwhile he held himself stiff so as to resist the shock.\r\n\r\n"Then I returned to Maigrat\'s, and said to him, ah, I said something to\r\nhim! And that it didn\'t do to have no heart, and that evil would happen\r\nto him if there were any justice. That bothered him; he turned his eyes\r\nand would like to have got away."\r\n\r\nFrom the back she had got down to the buttocks and was pushing into the\r\nfolds, not leaving any part of the body without passing over it, making\r\nhim shine like her three saucepans on Saturdays after a big clean.\r\nOnly she began to sweat with this tremendous exertion of her arms, so\r\nexhausted and out of breath that her words were choked.\r\n\r\n"At last he called me an old nuisance. We shall have bread until\r\nSaturday, and the best is that he has lent me five francs. I have got\r\nbutter, coffee, and chicory from him. I was even going to get the meat\r\nand potatoes there, only I saw that he was grumbling. Seven sous for\r\nthe chitterlings, eighteen for the potatoes, and I\'ve got three francs\r\nseventy-five left for a ragout and a meat soup. Eh, I don\'t think I\'ve\r\nwasted my morning!"\r\n\r\nNow she began to wipe him, plugging with a towel the parts that would\r\nnot dry. Feeling happy and without thinking of the future debt, he\r\nburst out laughing and took her in his arms.\r\n\r\n"Leave me alone, stupid! You are damp, and wetting me. Only I\'m afraid\r\nMaigrat has ideas----"\r\n\r\nShe was about to speak of Catherine, but she stopped. What was the good\r\nof disturbing him? It would only lead to endless discussion.\r\n\r\n"What ideas?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Why, ideas of robbing us. Catherine will have to examine the bill\r\ncarefully."\r\n\r\nHe took her in his arms again, and this time did not let her go.\r\nThe bath always finished in this way: she enlivened him by the hard\r\nrubbing, and then by the towels which tickled the hairs of his arms\r\nand chest. Besides, among all his mates of the settlement it was the\r\nhour for stupidities, when more children were planted than were wanted.\r\nAt night all the family were about. He pushed her towards the table,\r\njesting like a worthy man who was enjoying the only good moment of the\r\nday, calling that taking his dessert, and a dessert which cost him\r\nnothing. She, with her loose figure and breast, struggled a little for\r\nfun.\r\n\r\n"You are stupid! My Lord! you are stupid! And there\'s Estelle looking\r\nat us. Wait till I turn her head."\r\n\r\n"Oh, bosh! at three months; as if she understood!"\r\n\r\nWhen he got up Maheu simply put on a dry pair of breeches. He liked,\r\nwhen he was clean and had taken his pleasure with his wife, to remain\r\nnaked for a while. On his white skin, the whiteness of an anaemic girl,\r\nthe scratches and gashes of the coal left tattoo-marks, grafts as the\r\nminers called them; and he was proud of them, and exhibited his big\r\narms and broad chest shining like veined marble. In summer all the\r\nminers could be seen in this condition at their doors. He even went\r\nthere for a moment now, in spite of the wet weather, and shouted out a\r\nrough joke to a comrade, whose breast was also naked, on the other side\r\nof the gardens. Others also appeared. And the children, trailing along\r\nthe pathways, raised their heads and also laughed with delight at all\r\nthis weary flesh of workers displayed in the open air.\r\n\r\nWhile drinking his coffee, without yet putting on a shirt, Maheu\r\ntold his wife about the engineer\'s anger over the planking. He was\r\ncalm and unbent, and listened with a nod of approval to the sensible\r\nadvice of Maheude, who showed much common sense in such affairs. She\r\nalways repeated to him that nothing was gained by struggling against\r\nthe Company. She afterwards told him about Madame Hennebeau\'s visit.\r\nWithout saying so, both of them were proud of this.\r\n\r\n"Can I come down yet?" asked Catherine, from the top of the staircase.\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes; your father is drying himself."\r\n\r\nThe young girl had put on her Sunday dress, an old frock of rough blue\r\npoplin, already faded and worn in the folds. She had on a very simple\r\nbonnet of black tulle.\r\n\r\n"Hallo! you\'re dressed. Where are you going to?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m going to Montsou to buy a ribbon for my bonnet. I\'ve taken off the\r\nold one; it was too dirty."\r\n\r\n"Have you got money, then?"\r\n\r\n"No! but Mouquette promised to lend me half a franc."\r\n\r\nThe mother let her go. But at the door she called her back.\r\n\r\n"Here! don\'t go and buy that ribbon at Maigrat\'s. He will rob you, and\r\nhe will think that we are rolling in wealth."\r\n\r\nThe father, who was crouching down before the fire to dry his neck and\r\nshoulders more quickly, contented himself with adding:\r\n\r\n"Try not to dawdle about at night on the road."\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon, Maheu worked in his garden. Already he had sown\r\npotatoes, beans, and peas; and he now set about replanting cabbage and\r\nlettuce plants, which he had kept fresh from the night before. This bit\r\nof garden furnished them with vegetables, except potatoes of which they\r\nnever had enough. He understood gardening very well, and could even\r\ngrow artichokes, which was treated as sheer display by the neighbours.\r\nAs he was preparing the bed, Levaque just then came out to smoke a\r\npipe in his own square, looking at the cos lettuces which Bouteloup\r\nhad planted in the morning; for without the lodger\'s energy in digging\r\nnothing would have grown there but nettles. And a conversation arose\r\nover the trellis. Levaque, refreshed and excited by thrashing his wife,\r\nvainly tried to take Maheu off to Rasseneur\'s. Why, was he afraid of\r\na glass? They could have a game at skittles, lounge about for a while\r\nwith the mates, and then come back to dinner. That was the way of life\r\nafter leaving the pit. No doubt there was no harm in that, but Maheu\r\nwas obstinate; if he did not replant his lettuces they would be faded\r\nby to-morrow. In reality he refused out of good sense, not wishing to\r\nask a farthing from his wife out of the change of the five-franc piece.\r\n\r\nFive o\'clock was striking when Pierronne came to know if it was with\r\nJeanlin that her Lydie had gone off. Levaque replied that it must be\r\nsomething of that sort, for B\xc3\xa9bert had also disappeared, and those\r\nrascals always went prowling about together. When Maheu had quieted\r\nthem by speaking of the dandelion salad, he and his comrade set about\r\njoking the young woman with the coarseness of good-natured devils.\r\nShe was angry, but did not go away, in reality tickled by the strong\r\nwords which made her scream with her hands to her sides. A lean woman\r\ncame to her aid, stammering with anger like a clucking hen. Others\r\nin the distance on their doorsteps confided their alarms. Now the\r\nschool was closed; and all the children were running about, there was\r\na swarm of little creatures shouting and tumbling and fighting; while\r\nthose fathers who were not at the public-house were resting in groups\r\nof three or four, crouching on their heels as they did in the mine,\r\nsmoking their pipes with an occasional word in the shelter of a wall.\r\nPierronne went off in a fury when Levaque wanted to feel if her thighs\r\nwere firm; and he himself decided to go alone to Rasseneur\'s, since\r\nMaheu was still planting.\r\n\r\nTwilight suddenly came on; Maheude lit the lamp, irritated because\r\nneither her daughter nor the boys had come back. She could have guessed\r\nas much; they never succeeded in taking together the only meal of the\r\nday at which it was possible for them to be all round the table. Then\r\nshe was waiting for the dandelion salad. What could he be gathering\r\nat this hour, in this blackness of an oven, that nuisance of a child!\r\nA salad would go so well with the stew which was simmering on the\r\nfire--potatoes, leeks, sorrel, fricasseed with fried onion. The whole\r\nhouse smelt of that fried onion, that good odour which gets rank so\r\nsoon, and which penetrates the bricks of the settlements with such\r\ninfection that one perceives it far off in the country, the violent\r\nflavour of the poor man\'s kitchen.\r\n\r\nMaheu, when he left the garden at nightfall, at once fell into a chair\r\nwith his head against the wall. As soon as he sat down in the evening\r\nhe went to sleep. The clock struck seven; Henri and L\xc3\xa9nore had just\r\nbroken a plate in persisting in helping Alzire, who was laying the\r\ntable, when Father Bonnemort came in first, in a hurry to dine and go\r\nback to the pit. Then Maheude woke up Maheu.\r\n\r\n"Come and eat! So much the worse! They are big enough to find the\r\nhouse. The nuisance is the salad!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Rasseneur\'s, after having eaten his soup, \xc3\x89tienne went back into\r\nthe small chamber beneath the roof and facing the Voreux, which he was\r\nto occupy, and fell on to his bed dressed as he was, overcome with\r\nfatigue. In two days he had not slept four hours. When he awoke in the\r\ntwilight he was dazed for a moment, not recognizing his surroundings;\r\nand he felt such uneasiness and his head was so heavy that he rose,\r\npainfully, with the idea of getting some fresh air before having his\r\ndinner and going to bed for the night.\r\n\r\nOutside, the weather was becoming milder: the sooty sky was growing\r\ncopper-coloured, laden with one of those warm rains of the Nord, the\r\napproach of which one feels by the moist warmth of the air, and the\r\nnight was coming on in great mists which drowned the distant landscape\r\nof the plain. Over this immense sea of reddish earth the low sky seemed\r\nto melt into black dust, without a breath of wind now to animate the\r\ndarkness. It was the wan and deathly melancholy of a funeral.\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne walked straight ahead at random, with no other aim but to shake\r\noff his fever. When he passed before the Voreux, already growing gloomy\r\nat the bottom of its hole and with no lantern yet shining from it, he\r\nstopped a moment to watch the departure of the day-workers. No doubt\r\nsix o\'clock had struck; landers, porters from the pit-eye, and grooms\r\nwere going away in bands, mixed with the vague and laughing figures of\r\nthe screening girls in the shade.\r\n\r\nAt first it was Brul\xc3\xa9 and her son-in-law, Pierron. She was abusing him\r\nbecause he had not supported her in a quarrel with an overseer over her\r\nreckoning of stones.\r\n\r\n"Get along! damned good-for-nothing! Do you call yourself a man to\r\nlower yourself like that before one of these beasts who devour us?"\r\n\r\nPierron followed her peacefully, without replying. At last he said:\r\n\r\n"I suppose I ought to jump on the boss? Thanks for showing me how to\r\nget into a mess!"\r\n\r\n"Bend your backside to him, then," she shouted. "By God! if my daughter\r\nhad listened to me! It\'s not enough for them to kill the father.\r\nPerhaps you\'d like me to say \'thank you.\' No, I\'ll have their skins\r\nfirst!"\r\n\r\nTheir voices were lost. \xc3\x89tienne saw her disappear, with her eagle nose,\r\nher flying white hair, her long, lean arms that gesticulated furiously.\r\nBut the conversation of two young people behind caused him to listen.\r\nHe had recognized Zacharie, who was waiting there, and who had just\r\nbeen addressed by his friend Mouquet.\r\n\r\n"Are you here?" said the latter. "We will have something to eat, and\r\nthen off to the Volcan."\r\n\r\n"Directly. I\'ve something to attend to."\r\n\r\n"What, then?"\r\n\r\nThe lander turned and saw Philom\xc3\xa9ne coming out of the screening-shed.\r\nHe thought he understood.\r\n\r\n"Very well, if it\'s that. Then I go ahead."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I\'ll catch you up."\r\n\r\nAs he went away, Mouquet met his father, old Mouque, who was also\r\ncoming out of the Voreux. The two men simply wished each other good\r\nevening, the son taking the main road while the father went along by\r\nthe canal.\r\n\r\nZacharie was already pushing Philom\xc3\xa9ne in spite of her resistance into\r\nthe same solitary path. She was in a hurry, another time; and the two\r\nwrangled like old housemates. There was no fun in only seeing one\r\nanother out of doors, especially in winter, when the earth is moist and\r\nthere are no wheatfields to lie in.\r\n\r\n"No, no, it\'s not that," he whispered impatiently. "I\'ve something to\r\nsay to you." He led her gently with his arm round her waist. Then, when\r\nthey were in the shadow of the pit-bank, he asked if she had any money.\r\n\r\n"What for?" she demanded.\r\n\r\nThen he became confused, spoke of a debt of two francs which had\r\nreduced his family to despair.\r\n\r\n"Hold your tongue! I\'ve seen Mouquet; you\'re going again to the Volcan\r\nwith him, where those dirty singer-women are."\r\n\r\nHe defended himself, struck his chest, gave his word of honour. Then,\r\nas she shrugged her shoulders, he said suddenly:\r\n\r\n"Come with us if it will amuse you. You see that you don\'t put me out.\r\nWhat do I want to do with the singers? Will you come?"\r\n\r\n"And the little one?" she replied. "How can one stir with a child\r\nthat\'s always screaming? Let me go back, I guess they\'re not getting on\r\nat the house."\r\n\r\nBut he held her and entreated. See! it was only not to look foolish\r\nbefore Mouquet to whom he had promised. A man could not go to bed every\r\nevening like the fowls. She was overcome, and pulled up the skirt of\r\nher gown; with her nail she cut the thread and drew out some half-franc\r\npieces from a corner of the hem. For fear of being robbed by her mother\r\nshe hid there the profit of the overtime work she did at the pit.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got five, you see," she said, "I\'ll give you three. Only you must\r\nswear that you\'ll make your mother decide to let us marry. We\'ve had\r\nenough of this life in the open air. And mother reproaches me for every\r\nmouthful I eat. Swear first."\r\n\r\nShe spoke with the soft voice of a big, delicate girl, without passion,\r\nsimply tired of her life. He swore, exclaimed that it was a sacred\r\npromise; then, when he had got the three pieces, he kissed her, tickled\r\nher, made her laugh, and would have pushed things to an extreme in\r\nthis corner of the pit-bank, which was the winter chamber of their\r\nhousehold, if she had not again refused, saying that it would not give\r\nher any pleasure. She went back to the settlement alone, while he cut\r\nacross the fields to rejoin his companion.\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne had followed them mechanically, from afar, without\r\nunderstanding, regarding it as a simple rendezvous. The girls were\r\nprecocious in the pits; and he recalled the Lille work-girls whom he\r\nhad waited for behind the factories, those bands of girls, corrupted at\r\nfourteen, in the abandonment of their wretchedness. But another meeting\r\nsurprised him more. He stopped.\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of the pit-bank, in a hollow into which some large stones\r\nhad slipped, little Jeanlin was violently snubbing Lydie and B\xc3\xa9bert,\r\nseated one at his right, the other at his left.\r\n\r\n"What do you say? Eh? I\'ll slap each of you if you want more. Who\r\nthought of it first, eh?"\r\n\r\nIn fact, Jeanlin had had an idea. After having roamed about in the\r\nmeadows, along the canal, for an hour, gathering dandelions with the\r\ntwo others, it had occurred to him, before this pile of salad, that\r\nthey would never eat all that at home; and instead of going back to the\r\nsettlement he had gone to Montsou, keeping B\xc3\xa9bert to watch, and making\r\nLydie ring at the houses and offer the dandelions. He was experienced\r\nenough to know that, as he said, girls could sell what they liked.\r\nIn the ardour of business, the entire pile had disappeared; but the\r\ngirl had gained eleven sous. And now, with empty hands, the three were\r\ndividing the profits.\r\n\r\n"That\'s not fair!" B\xc3\xa9bert declared. "Must divide into three. If you\r\nkeep seven sous we shall only have two each."\r\n\r\n"What? not fair!" replied Jeanlin furiously. "I gathered more first of\r\nall."\r\n\r\nThe other usually submitted with timid admiration and a credulity which\r\nalways made him the dupe. Though older and stronger, he even allowed\r\nhimself to be struck. But this time the sight of all that money excited\r\nhim to rebellion.\r\n\r\n"He\'s robbing us, Lydie, isn\'t he? If he doesn\'t share, we\'ll tell his\r\nmother."\r\n\r\nJeanlin at once thrust his fist beneath the other\'s nose.\r\n\r\n"Say that again! I\'ll go and say at your house that you sold my\r\nmother\'s salad. And then, you silly beast, how can I divide eleven\r\nsous into three? Just try and see, if you\'re so clever. Here are your\r\ntwo sous each. Just look sharp and take them, or I\'ll put them in my\r\npocket."\r\n\r\nB\xc3\xa9bert was vanquished and accepted the two sous. Lydie, who was\r\ntrembling, had said nothing, for with Jeanlin she experienced the fear\r\nand the tenderness of a little beaten woman. When he held out the two\r\nsous to her she advanced her hand with a submissive laugh. But he\r\nsuddenly changed his mind.\r\n\r\n"Eh! what will you do with all that? Your mother will nab them, sure\r\nenough, if you don\'t know how to hide them from her. I\'d better keep\r\nthem for you. When you want money you can ask me for it."\r\n\r\nAnd the nine sous disappeared. To shut her mouth he had put his arms\r\naround her laughingly and was rolling with her over the pit-bank. She\r\nwas his little wife, and in the dark corners they used to try together\r\nthe love which they heard and saw in their homes behind partitions,\r\nthrough the cracks of doors. They knew everything, but they were able\r\nto do nothing, being too young, fumbling and playing for hours at the\r\ngames of vicious puppies. He called that playing at papa and mama; and\r\nwhen he chased her she ran away and let herself be caught with the\r\ndelicious trembling of instinct, often angry, but always yielding, in\r\nthe expectation of something which never came.\r\n\r\nAs B\xc3\xa9bert was not admitted to these games and received a cuffing\r\nwhenever he wanted to touch Lydie, he was always constrained, agitated\r\nby anger and uneasiness when the other two were amusing themselves,\r\nwhich they did not hesitate to do in his presence. His one idea,\r\ntherefore, was to frighten them and disturb them, calling out that\r\nsomeone could see them.\r\n\r\n"It\'s all up! There\'s a man looking."\r\n\r\nThis time he told the truth; it was \xc3\x89tienne, who had decided to\r\ncontinue his walk. The children jumped up and ran away, and he passed\r\nby round the bank, following the canal, amused at the terror of these\r\nlittle rascals. No doubt it was too early at their age, but they saw\r\nand heard so much that one would have to tie them up to restrain them.\r\nYet \xc3\x89tienne became sad.\r\n\r\nA hundred paces farther on he came across more couples. He had arrived\r\nat R\xc3\xa9quillart, and there, around the old ruined mine, all the girls of\r\nMontsou prowled about with their lovers. It was the common rendezvous,\r\nthe remote and deserted spot to which the putters came to get their\r\nfirst child when they dared not risk the shed. The broken palings\r\nopened to every one the old yard, now become a nondescript piece of\r\nground, obstructed by the ruins of the two sheds which had fallen\r\nin, and by the skeletons of the large buttresses which were still\r\nstanding. Derelict trams were lying about, and piles of old rotting\r\nwood, while a dense vegetation was reconquering this corner of ground,\r\ndisplaying itself in thick grass, and springing up in young trees that\r\nwere already vigorous. Every girl found herself at home here; there\r\nwere concealed holes for all; their lovers placed them over beams,\r\nbehind the timber, in the trams; they even lay elbow to elbow without\r\ntroubling about their neighbours. And it seemed that around this\r\nextinguished engine, near this shaft weary of disgorging coal, there\r\nwas a revenge of creation in the free love which, beneath the lash of\r\ninstinct, planted children in the bellies of these girls who were yet\r\nhardly women.\r\n\r\nYet a caretaker lived there, old Mouque, to whom the Company had given\r\nup, almost beneath the destroyed tower, two rooms which were constantly\r\nthreatened by destruction from the expected fall of the last walls.\r\nHe had even been obliged to shore up a part of the roof, and he lived\r\nthere very comfortably with his family, he and Mouquet in one room,\r\nMouquette in the other. As the windows no longer possessed a single\r\npane, he had decided to close them by nailing up boards; one could\r\nnot see well, but it was warm. For the rest, this caretaker cared for\r\nnothing: he went to look after his horses at the Voreux, and never\r\ntroubled himself about the ruins of R\xc3\xa9quillart, of which the shaft\r\nonly was preserved, in order to serve as a chimney for a fire which\r\nventilated the neighbouring pit.\r\n\r\nIt was thus that Father Mouque was ending his old age in the midst of\r\nlove. Ever since she was ten Mouquette had been lying about in all the\r\ncorners of the ruins, not as a timid and still green little urchin\r\nlike Lydie, but as a girl who was already big, and a mate for bearded\r\nlads. The father had nothing to say, for she was considerate, and\r\nnever introduced a lover into the house. Then he was used to this sort\r\nof accident. When he went to the Voreux, when he came back, whenever\r\nhe came out of his hole, he could scarcely put a foot down without\r\ntreading on a couple in the grass; and it was worse if he wanted to\r\ngather wood to heat his soup or look for burdocks for his rabbit at\r\nthe other end of the enclosure. Then he saw one by one the voluptuous\r\nnoses of all the girls of Montsou rising up around him, while he had\r\nto be careful not to knock against the limbs stretched out level with\r\nthe paths. Besides, these meetings had gradually ceased to disturb\r\neither him who was simply taking care not to stumble, or the girls whom\r\nhe allowed to finish their affairs, going away with discreet little\r\nsteps like a worthy man who was at peace with the ways of nature. Only\r\njust as they now knew him he at last also knew them, as one knows the\r\nrascally magpies who become corrupted in the pear-trees in the garden.\r\nAh! youth! youth! how it goes on, how wild it is! Sometimes he wagged\r\nhis chin with silent regret, turning away from the noisy wantons who\r\nwere breathing too loudly in the darkness. Only one thing put him out\r\nof temper: two lovers had acquired the bad habit of embracing outside\r\nhis wall. It was not that it prevented him from sleeping, but they\r\nleaned against the wall so heavily that at last they damaged it.\r\n\r\nEvery evening old Mouque received a visit from his friend, Father\r\nBonnemort, who regularly before dinner took the same walk. The two old\r\nmen spoke little, scarcely exchanging ten words during the half-hour\r\nthat they spent together. But it cheered them thus to think over the\r\ndays of old, to chew their recollections over again without need to\r\ntalk of them. At R\xc3\xa9quillart they sat on a beam side by side, saying a\r\nword and then sinking into their dreams, with faces bent towards the\r\nearth. No doubt they were becoming young again. Around them lovers\r\nwere turning over their sweethearts; there was a murmur of kisses and\r\nlaughter; the warm odour of the girls arose in the freshness of the\r\ntrodden grass. It was now forty-three years since Father Bonnemort had\r\ntaken his wife behind the pit; she was a putter, so slight that he had\r\nplaced her on a tram to embrace her at ease. Ah! those were fine days.\r\nAnd the two old men, shaking their heads, at last left each other,\r\noften without saying good night.\r\n\r\nThat evening, however, as \xc3\x89tienne arrived, Father Bonnemort, who was\r\ngetting up from the beam to return to the settlement, said to Mouque:\r\n\r\n"Good night, old man. I say, you knew Roussie?"\r\n\r\nMouque was silent for a moment, rocked his shoulders; then, returning\r\nto the house:\r\n\r\n"Good night, good night, old man."\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne came and sat on the beam, in his turn. His sadness was\r\nincreasing, though he could not tell why. The old man, whose\r\ndisappearing back he watched, recalled his arrival in the morning,\r\nand the flood of words which the piercing wind had dragged from his\r\nsilence. What wretchedness! And all these girls, worn out with fatigue,\r\nwho were still stupid enough in the evening to fabricate little ones,\r\nto yield flesh for labour and suffering! It would never come to an end\r\nif they were always filling themselves with starvelings. Would it not\r\nbe better if they were to shut up their bellies, and press their thighs\r\ntogether, as at the approach of misfortune? Perhaps these gloomy ideas\r\nonly stirred confusedly in him because he was alone, while all the\r\nothers at this hour were going about taking their pleasure in couples.\r\nThe mild weather stifled him a little, occasional drops of rain fell on\r\nhis feverish hands. Yes, they all came to it; it was something stronger\r\nthan reason.\r\n\r\nJust then, as \xc3\x89tienne remained seated motionless in the shadow, a\r\ncouple who came down from Montsou rustled against him without seeing\r\nhim as they entered the uneven R\xc3\xa9quillart ground. The girl, certainly a\r\nvirgin, was struggling and resisting with low whispered supplications,\r\nwhile the lad in silence was pushing her towards the darkness of a\r\ncorner of the shed, still upright, under which there were piles of\r\nold mouldy rope. It was Catherine and big Chaval. But \xc3\x89tienne had not\r\nrecognized them in passing, and his eyes followed them; he was watching\r\nfor the end of the story, touched by a sensuality which changed the\r\ncourse of his thoughts. Why should he interfere? When girls refuse it\r\nis because they like first to be forced.\r\n\r\nOn leaving the settlement of the Deux-Cent-Quarante Catherine had gone\r\nto Montsou along the road. From the age of ten, since she had earned\r\nher living at the pit, she went about the country alone in the complete\r\nliberty of the colliers\' families; and if no man had possessed her at\r\nfifteen it was owing to the tardy awakening of her puberty, the crisis\r\nof which had not yet arrived. When she was in front of the Company\'s\r\nYards she crossed the road and entered a laundress\'s where she was\r\ncertain to find Mouquette; for the latter stayed there from morning\r\ntill night, among women who treated each other with coffee all round.\r\nBut she was disappointed; Mouquette had just then been regaling them in\r\nher turn so thoroughly that she was not able to lend the half-franc she\r\nhad promised. To console her they vainly offered a glass of hot coffee.\r\nShe was not even willing that her companion should borrow from another\r\nwoman. An idea of economy had come to her, a sort of superstitious\r\nfear, the certainty that that ribbon would bring her bad luck if she\r\nwere to buy it now.\r\n\r\nShe hastened to regain the road to the settlement, and had reached the\r\nlast houses of Montsou when a man at the door of the Piquette Estaminet\r\ncalled her:\r\n\r\n"Eh! Catherine! where are you off to so quick?"\r\n\r\nIt was lanky Chaval. She was vexed, not because he displeased her, but\r\nbecause she was not inclined to joke.\r\n\r\n"Come in and have a drink. A little glass of sweet, won\'t you?"\r\n\r\nShe refused politely; the night was coming on, they were expecting her\r\nat home. He had advanced, and was entreating her in a low voice in the\r\nmiddle of the road. It had been his idea for a long time to persuade\r\nher to come up to the room which he occupied on the first story of the\r\nEstaminet Piquette, a fine room for a household, with a large bed. Did\r\nhe frighten her, that she always refused? She laughed good-naturedly,\r\nand said that she would come up some day when children didn\'t grow.\r\nThen, one thing leading to another, she told him, without knowing how,\r\nabout the blue ribbon which she had not been able to buy.\r\n\r\n"But I\'ll pay for it," he exclaimed.\r\n\r\nShe blushed, feeling that it would be best to refuse again, but\r\npossessed by a strong desire to have the ribbon. The idea of a loan\r\ncame back to her, and at last she accepted on condition that she should\r\nreturn to him what he spent on her. They began to joke again: it was\r\nagreed that if she did not sleep with him she should return him the\r\nmoney. But there was another difficulty when he talked of going to\r\nMaigrat\'s.\r\n\r\n"No, not Maigrat\'s; mother won\'t let me."\r\n\r\n"Why? is there any need to say where one goes? He has the best ribbons\r\nin Montsou."\r\n\r\nWhen Maigrat saw lanky Chaval and Catherine coming to his shop like two\r\nlovers who are buying their engagement gifts, he became very red, and\r\nexhibited his pieces of blue ribbon with the rage of a man who is being\r\nmade fun of. Then, when he had served the young people, he planted\r\nhimself at the door to watch them disappear in the twilight; and when\r\nhis wife came to ask him a question in a timid voice, he fell on her,\r\nabusing her, and exclaiming that he would make them repent some day,\r\nthe filthy creatures, who had no gratitude, when they ought all to be\r\non the ground licking his feet.\r\n\r\nLanky Chaval accompanied Catherine along the road. He walked beside\r\nher, swinging his arms; only he pushed her by the hip, conducting her\r\nwithout seeming to do so. She suddenly perceived that he had made her\r\nleave the pavement and that they were taking the narrow R\xc3\xa9quillart\r\nroad. But she had no time to be angry; his arm was already round her\r\nwaist, and he was dazing her with a constant caress of words. How\r\nstupid she was to be afraid! Did he want to hurt such a little darling,\r\nwho was as soft as silk, so tender that he could have devoured her?\r\nAnd he breathed behind her ear, in her neck, so that a shudder passed\r\nover the skin of her whole body. She felt stifled, and had nothing to\r\nreply. It was true that he seemed to love her. On Saturday evenings,\r\nafter having blown out the candle, she had asked herself what would\r\nhappen if he were to take her in this way; then, on going to sleep,\r\nshe had dreamed that she would no longer refuse, quite overcome by\r\npleasure. Why, then, at the same idea to-day did she feel repugnance\r\nand something like regret? While he was tickling her neck with his\r\nmoustache so softly that she closed her eyes, the shadow of another\r\nman, of the lad she had seen that morning, passed over the darkness of\r\nher closed eyelids.\r\n\r\nCatherine suddenly looked around her. Chaval had conducted her into the\r\nruins of R\xc3\xa9quillart and she recoiled, shuddering, from the darkness of\r\nthe fallen shed.\r\n\r\n"Oh! no! oh, no!" she murmured, "please let me go!" The fear of the\r\nmale had taken hold of her, that fear which stiffens the muscles in\r\nan impulse of defence, even when girls are willing, and feel the\r\nconquering approach of man. Her virginity which had nothing to learn\r\ntook fright as at a threatening blow, a wound of which she feared the\r\nunknown pain.\r\n\r\n"No, no! I don\'t want to! I tell you that I am too young. It\'s true!\r\nAnother time, when I am quite grown up."\r\n\r\nHe growled in a low voice:\r\n\r\n"Stupid! There\'s nothing to fear. What does that matter?"\r\n\r\nBut without speaking more he had seized her firmly and pushed her\r\nbeneath the shed. And she fell on her back on the old ropes; she ceased\r\nto protest, yielding to the male before her time, with that hereditary\r\nsubmission which from childhood had thrown down in the open air all the\r\ngirls of her race. Her frightened stammering grew faint, and only the\r\nardent breath of the man was heard.\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne, however, had listened without moving. Another who was taking\r\nthe leap! And now that he had seen the comedy he got up, overcome\r\nby uneasiness, by a kind of jealous excitement in which there was a\r\ntouch of anger. He no longer restrained himself; he stepped over the\r\nbeams, for those two were too much occupied now to be disturbed. He was\r\nsurprised, therefore, when he had gone a hundred paces along the path,\r\nto find that they were already standing up, and that they appeared,\r\nlike himself, to be returning to the settlement. The man again had\r\nhis arm round the girl\'s waist, and was squeezing her, with an air of\r\ngratitude, still speaking in her neck; and it was she who seemed in a\r\nhurry, anxious to return quickly, and annoyed at the delay.\r\n\r\nThen \xc3\x89tienne was tormented by the desire to see their faces. It was\r\nfoolish, and he hastened his steps, so as not to yield to it; but\r\nhis feet slackened of their own accord, and at the first lamppost he\r\nconcealed himself in the shade. He was petrified by horror when he\r\nrecognized Catherine and lanky Chaval. He hesitated at first: was it\r\nindeed she, that young girl in the coarse blue dress, with that bonnet?\r\nWas that the urchin whom he had seen in breeches, with her head in\r\nthe canvas cap? That was why she could pass so near him without his\r\nrecognizing her. But he no longer doubted; he had seen her eyes again,\r\nwith their greenish limpidity of spring water, so clear and so deep.\r\nWhat a wench! And he experienced a furious desire to avenge himself on\r\nher with contempt, without any motive. Besides, he did not like her as\r\na girl: she was frightful.\r\n\r\nCatherine and Chaval had passed him slowly. They did not know that they\r\nwere watched. He held her to kiss her behind the ear, and she began\r\nto slacken her steps beneath his caresses, which made her laugh. Left\r\nbehind, \xc3\x89tienne was obliged to follow them, irritated because they\r\nbarred the road and because in spite of himself he had to witness these\r\nthings which exasperated him. It was true, then, what she had sworn to\r\nhim in the morning: she was not any one\'s mistress; and he, who had not\r\nbelieved her, who had deprived himself of her in order not to act like\r\nthe other! and who had let her be taken beneath his nose, pushing his\r\nstupidity so far as to be dirtily amused at seeing them! It made him\r\nmad! he clenched his hands, he could have devoured that man in one of\r\nthose impulses to kill in which he saw everything red.\r\n\r\nThe walk lasted for half an hour. When Chaval and Catherine approached\r\nthe Voreux they slackened their pace still more; they stopped twice\r\nbeside the canal, three times along the pit-bank, very cheerful now and\r\noccupied with little tender games. \xc3\x89tienne was obliged to stop also\r\nwhen they stopped, for fear of being perceived. He endeavoured to feel\r\nnothing but a brutal regret: that would teach him to treat girls with\r\nconsideration through being well brought up! Then, after passing the\r\nVoreux, and at last free to go and dine at Rasseneur\'s, he continued\r\nto follow them, accompanying them to the settlement, where he remained\r\nstanding in the shade for a quarter of an hour, waiting until Chaval\r\nleft Catherine to enter her home. And when he was quite sure that they\r\nwere no longer together, he set off walking afresh, going very far\r\nalong the Marchiennes road, stamping, and thinking of nothing, too\r\nstifled and too sad to shut himself up in a room.\r\n\r\nIt was not until an hour later, towards nine o\'clock, that \xc3\x89tienne\r\nagain passed the settlement, saying to himself that he must eat and\r\nsleep, if he was to be up again at four o\'clock in the morning. The\r\nvillage was already asleep, and looked quite black in the night. Not a\r\ngleam shone from the closed shutters, the house fronts slept, with the\r\nheavy sleep of snoring barracks. Only a cat escaped through the empty\r\ngardens. It was the end of the day, the collapse of workers falling\r\nfrom the table to the bed, overcome with weariness and food.\r\n\r\nAt Rasseneur\'s, in the lighted room, an engine-man and two day-workers\r\nwere drinking. But before going in \xc3\x89tienne stopped to throw one last\r\nglance into the darkness. He saw again the same black immensity as in\r\nthe morning when he had arrived in the wind. Before him the Voreux was\r\ncrouching, with its air of an evil beast, its dimness pricked with a\r\nfew lantern lights. The three braziers of the bank were burning in the\r\nair, like bloody moons, now and then showing the vast silhouettes of\r\nFather Bonnemort and his yellow horse. And beyond, in the flat plain,\r\nshade had submerged everything, Montsou, Marchiennes, the forest of\r\nVandame, the immense sea of beetroot and of wheat, in which there only\r\nshone, like distant lighthouses, the blue fires of the blast furnaces,\r\nand the red fires of the coke ovens. Gradually the night came on, the\r\nrain was now falling slowly, continuously, burying this void in its\r\nmonotonous streaming. Only one voice was still heard, the thick, slow\r\nrespiration of the pumping engine, breathing both by day and by night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART THREE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the next day, and the days that followed, \xc3\x89tienne continued his\r\nwork at the pit. He grew accustomed to it; his existence became\r\nregulated by this labour and to these new habits which had seemed\r\nso hard to him at first. Only one episode interrupted the monotony\r\nof the first fortnight: a slight fever which kept him in bed for\r\nforty-eight hours with aching limbs and throbbing head, dreaming in a\r\nstate of semi-delirium that he was pushing his tram in a passage that\r\nwas so narrow that his body would not pass through. It was simply the\r\nexhaustion of his apprenticeship, an excess of fatigue from which he\r\nquickly recovered.\r\n\r\nAnd days followed days, until weeks and months had slipped by. Now,\r\nlike his mates, he got up at three o\'clock, drank his coffee, and\r\ncarried off the double slice of bread and butter which Madame Rasseneur\r\nhad prepared for him the evening before. Regularly as he went every\r\nmorning to the pit, he met old Bonnemort who was going home to sleep,\r\nand on leaving in the afternoon he crossed Bouteloup who was going\r\nto his task. He had his cap, his breeches and canvas jacket, and he\r\nshivered and warmed his back in the shed before the large fire. Then\r\ncame the waiting with naked feet in the receiving-room, swept by\r\nfurious currents of air. But the engine, with its great steel limbs\r\nstarred with copper shining up above in the shade, no longer attracted\r\nhis attention, nor the cables which flew by with the black and\r\nsilent motion of a nocturnal bird, nor the cages rising and plunging\r\nunceasingly in the midst of the noise of signals, of shouted orders, of\r\ntrams shaking the metal floor. His lamp burnt badly, that confounded\r\nlamp-man could not have cleaned it; and he only woke up when Mouquet\r\nbundled them all off, roguishly smacking the girls\' flanks. The cage\r\nwas unfastened, and fell like a stone to the bottom of a hole without\r\ncausing him even to lift his head to see the daylight vanish. He never\r\nthought of a possible fall; he felt himself at home as he sank into the\r\ndarkness beneath the falling rain. Below at the pit-eye, when Pierron\r\nhad unloaded them with his air of hypocritical mildness, there was\r\nalways the same tramping as of a flock, the yard-men each going away\r\nto his cutting with trailing steps. He now knew the mine galleries\r\nbetter than the streets of Montsou; he knew where he had to turn, where\r\nhe had to stoop, and where he had to avoid a puddle. He had grown so\r\naccustomed to these two kilometres beneath the earth, that he could\r\nhave traversed them without a lamp, with his hands in his pockets. And\r\nevery time the same meetings took place: a captain lighting up the\r\nfaces of the passing workmen, Father Mouque leading a horse, B\xc3\xa9bert\r\nconducting the snorting Bataille, Jeanlin running behind the tram to\r\nclose the ventilation doors, and big Mouquette and lean Lydie pushing\r\ntheir trams.\r\n\r\nAfter a time, also, \xc3\x89tienne suffered much less from the damp and\r\ncloseness of the cutting. The chimney or ascending passage seemed to\r\nhim more convenient for climbing up, as if he had melted and could\r\npass through cracks where before he would not have risked a hand.\r\nHe breathed the coal-dust without difficulty, saw clearly in the\r\nobscurity, and sweated tranquilly, having grown accustomed to the\r\nsensation of wet garments on his body from morning to night. Besides,\r\nhe no longer spent his energy recklessly; he had gained skill so\r\nrapidly that he astonished the whole stall. In three weeks he was\r\nnamed among the best putters in the pit; no one pushed a tram more\r\nrapidly to the upbrow, nor loaded it afterwards so correctly. His small\r\nfigure allowed him to slip about everywhere, and though his arms were\r\nas delicate and white as a woman\'s, they seemed to be made of iron\r\nbeneath the smooth skin, so vigorously did they perform their task.\r\nHe never complained, out of pride no doubt, even when he was panting\r\nwith fatigue. The only thing they had against him was that he could not\r\ntake a joke, and grew angry as soon as any one trod on his toes. In all\r\nother respects he was accepted and looked upon as a real miner, reduced\r\nbeneath this pressure of habit, little by little, to a machine.\r\n\r\nMaheu regarded \xc3\x89tienne with special friendship, for he respected work\r\nthat was well done. Then, like the others, he felt that this lad had\r\nmore education than himself; he saw him read, write, and draw little\r\nplans; he heard him talking of things of which he himself did not\r\nknow even the existence. This caused him no astonishment, for miners\r\nare rough fellows who have thicker heads than engine-men; but he was\r\nsurprised at the courage of this little chap, and at the cheerful way\r\nhe had bitten into the coal to avoid dying of hunger. He had never met\r\na workman who grew accustomed to it so quickly. So when hewing was\r\nurgent, and he did not wish to disturb a pikeman, he gave the timbering\r\nover to the young man, being sure of the neatness and solidity of his\r\nwork. The bosses were always bothering him about the damned planking\r\nquestion; he feared every hour the appearance of the engineer N\xc3\xa9grel,\r\nfollowed by Dansaert, shouting, discussing, ordering everything to\r\nbe done over again, and he remarked that his putter\'s timbering gave\r\ngreater satisfaction to these gentlemen, in spite of their air of never\r\nbeing pleased with anything, and their repeated assertions that the\r\nCompany would one day or another take radical measures. Things dragged\r\non; a deep discontent was fomenting in the pit, and Maheu himself, in\r\nspite of his calmness, was beginning to clench his fists.\r\n\r\nThere was at first some rivalry between Zacharie and \xc3\x89tienne. One\r\nevening they were even coming to blows. But the former, a good lad\r\nthough careless of everything but his own pleasure, was quickly\r\nappeased by the friendly offer of a glass, and soon yielded to the\r\nsuperiority of the new-comer. Levaque was also on good terms with\r\nhim, talking politics with the putter, who, as he said, had his own\r\nideas. The only one of the men in whom he felt a deep hostility was\r\nlanky Chaval: not that they were cool towards each other, for, on\r\nthe contrary, they had become companions; only when they joked their\r\neyes seemed to devour each other. Catherine continued to move among\r\nthem as a tired, resigned girl, bending her back, pushing her tram,\r\nalways good-natured with her companion in the putting, who aided her\r\nin his turn, and submissive to the wishes of her lover, whose caresses\r\nshe now received openly. It was an accepted situation, a recognized\r\ndomestic arrangement to which the family itself closed its eyes to\r\nsuch a degree that Chaval every evening led away the putter behind the\r\npit-bank, then brought her back to her parents\' door, where he finally\r\nembraced her before the whole settlement. \xc3\x89tienne, who believed that he\r\nhad reconciled himself to the situation, often teased her about these\r\nwalks, making crude remarks by way of joke, as lads and girls will at\r\nthe bottom of the cuttings; and she replied in the same tone, telling\r\nin a swaggering way what her lover had done to her, yet disturbed and\r\ngrowing pale when the young man\'s eyes chanced to meet hers. Then both\r\nwould turn away their heads, not speaking again, perhaps, for an hour,\r\nlooking as if they hated each other because of something buried within\r\nthem and which they could never explain to each other.\r\n\r\nThe spring had come. On emerging from the pit one day \xc3\x89tienne had\r\nreceived in his face a warm April breeze, a good odour of young earth,\r\nof tender greenness, of large open air; and now, every time he came\r\nup the spring smelt sweeter, warmed him more, after his ten hours of\r\nlabour in the eternal winter at the bottom, in the midst of that damp\r\ndarkness which no summer had ever dissipated. The days grew longer and\r\nlonger; at last, in May, he went down at sunrise when a vermilion sky\r\nlit up the Voreux with a mist of dawn in which the white vapour of the\r\npumping-engine became rose-coloured. There was no more shivering, a\r\nwarm breath blew across the plain, while the larks sang far above. Then\r\nat three o\'clock he was dazzled by the now burning sun which set fire\r\nto the horizon, and reddened the bricks beneath the filth of the coal.\r\nIn June the wheat was already high, of a blue green, which contrasted\r\nwith the black green of the beetroots. It was an endless vista\r\nundulating beneath the slightest breeze; and he saw it spread and grow\r\nfrom day to day, and was sometimes surprised, as if he had found it in\r\nthe evening more swollen with verdure than it had been in the morning.\r\nThe poplars along the canal were putting on their plumes of leaves.\r\nGrass was invading the pit-bank, flowers were covering the meadows, a\r\nwhole life was germinating and pushing up from this earth beneath which\r\nhe was groaning in misery and fatigue.\r\n\r\nWhen \xc3\x89tienne now went for a walk in the evening he no longer startled\r\nlovers behind the pit-bank. He could follow their track in the wheat\r\nand divine their wanton birds\' nests by eddies among the yellowing\r\nblades and the great red poppies. Zacharie and Philom\xc3\xa9ne came back to\r\nit out of old domestic habit; Mother Brul\xc3\xa9, always on Lydie\'s heels,\r\nwas constantly hunting her out with Jeanlin, buried so deeply together\r\nthat one had to tread on them before they made up their minds to get\r\nup; and as to Mouquette, she lay about everywhere--one could not cross\r\na field without seeing her head plunge down while only her feet emerged\r\nas she lay at full length. But all these were quite free; the young man\r\nfound nothing guilty there except on the evenings when he met Catherine\r\nand Chaval. Twice he saw them on his approach tumble down in the midst\r\nof a field, where the motionless stalks afterwards remained dead.\r\nAnother time, as he was going along a narrow path, Catherine\'s clear\r\neyes appeared before him, level with the wheat, and immediately sank.\r\nThen the immense plain seemed to him too small, and he preferred to\r\npass the evening at Rasseneur\'s, in the Avantage.\r\n\r\n"Give me a glass, Madame Rasseneur. No, I\'m not going out to-night; my\r\nlegs are too stiff."\r\n\r\nAnd he turned towards a comrade, who always sat at the bottom table\r\nwith his head against the wall.\r\n\r\n"Souvarine, won\'t you have one?"\r\n\r\n"No, thanks; nothing."\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne had become acquainted with Souvarine through living there side\r\nby side. He was an engine-man at the Voreux, and occupied the furnished\r\nroom upstairs next to his own. He must have been about thirty years\r\nold, fair and slender, with a delicate face framed by thick hair and a\r\nslight beard. His white pointed teeth, his thin mouth and nose, with\r\nhis rosy complexion, gave him a girlish appearance, an air of obstinate\r\ngentleness, across which the grey reflection of his steely eyes threw\r\nsavage gleams. In his poor workman\'s room there was nothing but a box\r\nof papers and books. He was a Russian, and never spoke of himself, so\r\nthat many stories were afloat concerning him. The colliers, who are\r\nvery suspicious with strangers, guessing from his small middle-class\r\nhands that he belonged to another caste, had at first imagined a\r\nromance, some assassination, and that he was escaping punishment. But\r\nthen he had behaved in such a fraternal way with them, without any\r\npride, distributing to the youngsters of the settlement all the sous\r\nin his pockets, that they now accepted him, reassured by the term\r\n"political refugee" which circulated about him--a vague term, in which\r\nthey saw an excuse even for crime, and, as it were, a companionship in\r\nsuffering.\r\n\r\nDuring the first weeks, \xc3\x89tienne had found him timid and reserved, so\r\nthat he only discovered his history later on. Souvarine was the latest\r\nborn of a noble family in the Government of Tula. At St. Petersburg,\r\nwhere he studied medicine, the socialistic enthusiasm which then\r\ncarried away all the youth in Russia had decided him to learn a manual\r\ntrade, that of a mechanic, so that he could mix with the people, in\r\norder to know them and help them as a brother. And it was by this\r\ntrade that he was now living after having fled, in consequence of an\r\nunsuccessful attempt against the tsar\'s life: for a month he had lived\r\nin a fruiterer\'s cellar, hollowing out a mine underneath the road,\r\nand charging bombs, with the constant risk of being blown up with\r\nthe house. Renounced by his family, without money, expelled from the\r\nFrench workshops as a foreigner who was regarded as a spy, he was dying\r\nof starvation when the Montsou Company had at last taken him on at a\r\nmoment of pressure. For a year he had laboured there as a good, sober,\r\nsilent workman, doing day-work one week and night-work the next week,\r\nso regularly that the masters referred to him as an example to the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n"Are you never thirsty?" said \xc3\x89tienne to him, laughing.\r\n\r\nAnd he replied with his gentle voice, almost without an accent:\r\n\r\n"I am thirsty when I eat."\r\n\r\nHis companion also joked him about the girls, declaring that he had\r\nseen him with a putter in the wheat on the Bas-de-Soie side. Then he\r\nshrugged his shoulders with tranquil indifference. What should he do\r\nwith a putter? Woman was for him a boy, a comrade, when she had the\r\nfraternal feeling and the courage of a man. What was the good of having\r\na possible act of cowardice on one\'s conscience? He desired no bond,\r\neither woman or friend; he would be master of his own life and those of\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nEvery evening towards nine o\'clock, when the inn was emptying, \xc3\x89tienne\r\nremained thus talking with Souvarine. He drank his beer in small\r\nsips, while the engine-man smoked constant cigarettes, of which the\r\ntobacco had at last stained his slender fingers. His vague mystic\'s\r\neyes followed the smoke in the midst of a dream; his left hand sought\r\noccupation by nervously twitching; and he usually ended by installing a\r\ntame rabbit on his knees, a large doe with young, who lived at liberty\r\nin the house. This rabbit, which he had named Poland, had grown to\r\nworship him; she would come and smell his trousers, fawn on him and\r\nscratch him with her paws until he took her up like a child. Then,\r\nlying in a heap against him, her ears laid back, she would close her\r\neyes; and without growing tired, with an unconscious caressing gesture,\r\nhe would pass his hand over her grey silky fur, calmed by that warm\r\nliving softness.\r\n\r\n"You know I have had a letter from Pluchart," said \xc3\x89tienne one evening.\r\n\r\nOnly Rasseneur was there. The last client had departed for the\r\nsettlement, which was now going to bed.\r\n\r\n"Ah!" exclaimed the innkeeper, standing up before his two lodgers. "How\r\nare things going with Pluchart?"\r\n\r\nDuring the last two months, \xc3\x89tienne had kept up a constant\r\ncorrespondence with the Lille mechanician, whom he had told of his\r\nMontsou engagement, and who was now indoctrinating him, having been\r\nstruck by the propaganda which he might carry on among the miners.\r\n\r\n"The association is getting on very well. It seems that they are coming\r\nin from all sides."\r\n\r\n"What have you got to say, eh, about their society?" asked Rasseneur of\r\nSouvarine.\r\n\r\nThe latter, who was softly scratching Poland\'s head, blew out a puff of\r\nsmoke and muttered, with his tranquil air:\r\n\r\n"More foolery!"\r\n\r\nBut \xc3\x89tienne grew enthusiastic. A predisposition for revolt was throwing\r\nhim, in the first illusions of his ignorance, into the struggle\r\nof labour against capital. It was the International Working Men\'s\r\nAssociation that they were concerned with, that famous International\r\nwhich had just been founded in London. Was not that a superb effort, a\r\ncampaign in which justice would at last triumph? No more frontiers; the\r\nworkers of the whole world rising and uniting to assure to the labourer\r\nthe bread that he has earned. And what a simple and great organization!\r\nBelow, the section which represents the commune; then the federation\r\nwhich groups the sections of the same province; then the nation; and\r\nthen, at last, humanity incarnated in a general council in which each\r\nnation was represented by a corresponding secretary. In six months\r\nit would conquer the world, and would be able to dictate laws to the\r\nmasters should they prove obstinate.\r\n\r\n"Foolery!" repeated Souvarine. "Your Karl Marx is still only thinking\r\nabout letting natural forces act. No politics, no conspiracies, is it\r\nnot so? Everything in the light of day, and simply to raise wages.\r\nDon\'t bother me with your evolution! Set fire to the four corners of\r\nthe town, mow down the people, level everything, and when there is\r\nnothing more of this rotten world left standing, perhaps a better one\r\nwill grow up in its place."\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne began to laugh. He did not always take in his comrade\'s\r\nsayings; this theory of destruction seemed to him an affectation.\r\nRasseneur, who was still more practical, like a man of solid common\r\nsense did not condescend to get angry. He only wanted to have things\r\nclear.\r\n\r\n"Then, what? Are you going to try and create a section at Montsou?"\r\n\r\nThis was what was desired by Pluchart, who was secretary to the\r\nFederation of the Nord. He insisted especially on the services which\r\nthe association would render to the miners should they go out on\r\nstrike. \xc3\x89tienne believed that a strike was imminent: this timbering\r\nbusiness would turn out badly; any further demands on the part of the\r\nCompany would cause rebellion in all the pits.\r\n\r\n"It\'s the subscriptions that are the nuisance," Rasseneur declared, in\r\na judicial tone. "Half a franc a year for the general fund, two francs\r\nfor the section; it looks like nothing, but I bet that many will refuse\r\nto give it."\r\n\r\n"All the more," added \xc3\x89tienne, "because we must first have here a\r\nProvident Fund, which we can use if need be as an emergency fund. No\r\nmatter, it is time to think about these things. I am ready if the\r\nothers are."\r\n\r\nThere was silence. The petroleum lamp smoked on the counter. Through\r\nthe large open door they could distinctly hear the shovel of a stoker\r\nat the Voreux stoking the engine.\r\n\r\n"Everything is so dear!" began Madame Rasseneur, who had entered\r\nand was listening with a gloomy air as if she had grown up in her\r\neverlasting black dress. "When I tell you that I\'ve paid twenty-two\r\nsous for eggs! It will have to burst up."\r\n\r\nAll three men this time were of the same opinion. They spoke one after\r\nthe other in a despairing voice, giving expression to their complaints.\r\nThe workers could not hold out; the Revolution had only aggravated\r\ntheir wretchedness; only the bourgeois had grown fat since \'89, so\r\ngreedily that they had not even left the bottom of the plates to lick.\r\nWho could say that the workers had had their reasonable share in the\r\nextraordinary increase of wealth and comfort during the last hundred\r\nyears? They had made fun of them by declaring them free. Yes, free to\r\nstarve, a freedom of which they fully availed themselves. It put no\r\nbread into your cupboard to go and vote for fine fellows who went away\r\nand enjoyed themselves, thinking no more of the wretched voters than\r\nof their old boots. No! one way or another it would have to come to an\r\nend, either quietly by laws, by an understanding in good fellowship,\r\nor like savages by burning everything and devouring one another. Even\r\nif they never saw it, their children would certainly see it, for the\r\ncentury could not come to an end without another revolution, that of\r\nthe workers this time, a general hustling which would cleanse society\r\nfrom top to bottom, and rebuild it with more cleanliness and justice.\r\n\r\n"It will have to burst up," Madame Rasseneur repeated energetically.\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes," they all three cried. "It will have to burst up." Souvarine\r\nwas now tickling Poland\'s ears, and her nose was curling with pleasure.\r\nHe said in a low voice, with abstracted gaze, as if to himself:\r\n\r\n"Raise wages--how can you? They\'re fixed by an iron law to the smallest\r\npossible sum, just the sum necessary to allow the workers to eat dry\r\nbread and get children. If they fall too low, the workers die, and the\r\ndemand for new men makes them rise. If they rise too high, more men\r\ncome, and they fall. It is the balance of empty bellies, a sentence to\r\na perpetual prison of hunger."\r\n\r\nWhen he thus forgot himself, entering into the questions that stir an\r\neducated socialist, \xc3\x89tienne and Rasseneur became restless, disturbed by\r\nhis despairing statements which they were unable to answer.\r\n\r\n"Do you understand?" he said again, gazing at them with his habitual\r\ncalmness; "we must destroy everything, or hunger will reappear. Yes,\r\nanarchy and nothing more; the earth washed in blood and purified by\r\nfire! Then we shall see!"\r\n\r\n"Monsieur is quite right," said Madame Rasseneur, who, in her\r\nrevolutionary violence, was always very polite.\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne, in despair at his ignorance, would argue no longer. He rose,\r\nremarking:\r\n\r\n"Let\'s go to bed. All this won\'t save one from getting up at three\r\no\'clock."\r\n\r\nSouvarine, having blown away the cigarette-end which was sticking to\r\nhis lips, was already gently lifting the big rabbit beneath the belly\r\nto place it on the ground. Rasseneur was shutting up the house. They\r\nseparated in silence with buzzing ears, as if their heads had swollen\r\nwith the grave questions they had been discussing.\r\n\r\nAnd every evening there were similar conversations in the bare room\r\naround the single glass which \xc3\x89tienne took an hour to empty. A crowd\r\nof obscure ideas, asleep within him, were stirring and expanding.\r\nEspecially consumed by the need of knowledge, he had long hesitated\r\nto borrow books from his neighbour, who unfortunately had hardly\r\nany but German and Russian works. At last he had borrowed a French\r\nbook on Co-operative Societies--mere foolery, said Souvarine; and\r\nhe also regularly read a newspaper which the latter received, the\r\nCombat, an Anarchist journal published at Geneva. In other respects,\r\nnotwithstanding their daily relations, he found him as reserved as\r\never, with his air of camping in life, without interests or feelings or\r\npossessions of any kind.\r\n\r\nTowards the first days of July, \xc3\x89tienne\'s situation began to improve.\r\nIn the midst of this monotonous life, always beginning over again,\r\nan accident had occurred. The stalls in the Guillaume seam had come\r\nacross a shifting of the strata, a general disturbance in the layers,\r\nwhich certainly announced that they were approaching a fault; and, in\r\nfact, they soon came across this fault which the engineers, in spite\r\nof considerable knowledge of the soil, were still ignorant of. This\r\nupset the pit; nothing was talked of but the lost seam, which was to\r\nbe found, no doubt, lower down on the other side of the fault. The old\r\nminers were already expanding their nostrils, like good dogs, in a\r\nchase for coal. But, meanwhile, the hewers could not stand with folded\r\narms, and placards announced that the Company would put up new workings\r\nto auction.\r\n\r\nMaheu, on coming out one day, accompanied \xc3\x89tienne and offered to take\r\nhim on as a pikeman in his working, in place of Levaque who had gone\r\nto another yard. The matter had already been arranged with the head\r\ncaptain and the engineer, who were very pleased with the young man. So\r\n\xc3\x89tienne merely had to accept this rapid promotion, glad of the growing\r\nesteem in which Maheu held him.\r\n\r\nIn the evening they returned together to the pit to take note of the\r\nplacards. The cuttings put up to auction were in the Filonni\xc3\xa9re seam in\r\nthe north gallery of the Voreux. They did not seem very advantageous,\r\nand the miner shook his head when the young man read out the\r\nconditions. On the following day when they had gone down, he took him\r\nto see the seam, and showed him how far away it was from the pit-eye,\r\nthe crumbly nature of the earth, the thinness and hardness of the coal.\r\nBut if they were to eat they would have to work. So on the following\r\nSunday they went to the auction, which took place in the shed and was\r\npresided over by the engineer of the pit, assisted by the head captain,\r\nin the absence of the divisional engineer. From five to six hundred\r\nminers were there in front of the little platform, which was placed in\r\nthe corner, and the bidding went on so rapidly that one only heard a\r\ndeep tumult of voices, of shouted figures drowned by other figures.\r\n\r\nFor a moment Maheu feared that he would not be able to obtain one of\r\nthe forty workings offered by the Company. All the rivals went lower,\r\ndisquieted by the rumours of a crisis and the panic of a lock-out.\r\nN\xc3\xa9grel, the engineer, did not hurry in the face of this panic, and\r\nallowed the offers to fall to the lowest possible figures, while\r\nDansaert, anxious to push matters still further, lied with regard to\r\nthe quality of the workings. In order to get his fifty metres, Maheu\r\nstruggled with a comrade who was also obstinate; in turn they each took\r\noff a centime from the tram; and if he conquered in the end it was only\r\nby lowering the wage to such an extent, that the captain Richomme, who\r\nwas standing behind him, muttered between his teeth, and nudged him\r\nwith his elbow, growling angrily that he could never do it at that\r\nprice.\r\n\r\nWhen they came out \xc3\x89tienne was swearing. And he broke out before\r\nChaval, who was returning from the wheatfields in company with\r\nCatherine, amusing himself while his father-in-law was absorbed in\r\nserious business.\r\n\r\n"By God!" he exclaimed, "it\'s simply slaughter! Today it is the worker\r\nwho is forced to devour the worker!"\r\n\r\nChaval was furious. He would never have lowered it, he wouldn\'t.\r\nAnd Zacharie, who had come out of curiosity, declared that it was\r\ndisgusting. But \xc3\x89tienne with a violent gesture silenced them.\r\n\r\n"It will end some day, we shall be the masters!"\r\n\r\nMaheu, who had been mute since the auction, appeared to wake up. He\r\nrepeated:\r\n\r\n"Masters! Ah! bad luck! it can\'t be too soon!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was Montsou feast-day, the last Sunday in July. Since Saturday\r\nevening the good housekeepers of the settlement had deluged their\r\nparlours with water, throwing bucketfuls over the flags and against the\r\nwalls; and the floor was not yet dry, in spite of the white sand which\r\nhad been strewn over it, an expensive luxury for the purses of the\r\npoor. But the day promised to be very warm; it was one of those heavy\r\nskies threatening storm, which in summer stifle this flat bare country\r\nof the Nord.\r\n\r\nSunday upset the hours for rising, even among the Maheus. While the\r\nfather, after five o\'clock, grew weary of his bed and dressed himself,\r\nthe children lay in bed until nine. On this day Maheu went to smoke\r\na pipe in the garden, and then came back to eat his bread and butter\r\nalone, while waiting. He thus passed the morning in a random manner; he\r\nmended the tub, which leaked; stuck up beneath the clock a portrait of\r\nthe prince imperial which had been given to the little ones. However,\r\nthe others came down one by one. Father Bonnemort had taken a chair\r\noutside, to sit in the sun, while the mother and Alzire had at once set\r\nabout cooking. Catherine appeared, pushing before her L\xc3\xa9nore and Henri,\r\nwhom she had just dressed. Eleven o\'clock struck, and the odour of the\r\nrabbit, which was boiling with potatoes, was already filling the house\r\nwhen Zacharie and Jeanlin came down last, still yawning and with their\r\nswollen eyes.\r\n\r\nThe settlement was now in a flutter, excited by the feast-day, and\r\nin expectation of dinner, which was being hastened for the departure\r\nin bands to Montsou. Troops of children were rushing about. Men in\r\ntheir shirt-sleeves were trailing their old shoes with the lazy gait\r\nof days of rest. Windows and doors, opened wide in the fine weather,\r\ngave glimpses of rows of parlours which were filled with movement and\r\nshouts and the chatter of families. And from one end to the other of\r\nthe frontages, there was a smell of rabbit, a rich kitchen smell which\r\non this day struggled with the inveterate odour of fried onion.\r\n\r\nThe Maheus dined at midday. They made little noise in the midst of\r\nthe chatter from door to door, in the coming and going of women in\r\na constant uproar of calls and replies, of objects borrowed, of\r\nyoungsters hunted away or brought back with a slap. Besides, they\r\nhad not been on good terms during the last three weeks with their\r\nneighbours, the Levaques, on the subject of the marriage of Zacharie\r\nand Philom\xc3\xa9ne. The men passed the time of day, but the women pretended\r\nnot to know each other. This quarrel had strengthened the relations\r\nwith Pierronne, only Pierronne had left Pierron and Lydie with her\r\nmother, and set out early in the morning to spend the day with a cousin\r\nat Marchiennes; and they joked, for they knew this cousin; she had a\r\nmoustache, and was head captain at the Voreux. Maheude declared that it\r\nwas not proper to leave one\'s family on a feast-day Sunday.\r\n\r\nBeside the rabbit with potatoes, a rabbit which had been fattening\r\nin the shed for a month, the Maheus had meat soup and beef. The\r\nfortnight\'s wages had just fallen due the day before. They could not\r\nrecollect such a spread. Even at the last St. Barbara\'s Day, the fete\r\nof the miners when they do nothing for three days, the rabbit had\r\nnot been so fat nor so tender. So the ten pairs of jaws, from little\r\nEstelle, whose teeth were beginning to appear, to old Bonnemort,\r\nwho was losing his, worked so heartily that the bones themselves\r\ndisappeared. The meat was good, but they could not digest it well; they\r\nsaw it too seldom. Everything disappeared; there only remained a piece\r\nof boiled beef for the evening. They could add bread and butter if they\r\nwere hungry.\r\n\r\nJeanlin went out first. B\xc3\xa9bert was waiting for him behind the school,\r\nand they prowled about for a long time before they were able to entice\r\naway Lydie, whom Brul\xc3\xa9, who had decided not to go out, was trying\r\nto keep with her. When she perceived that the child had fled, she\r\nshouted and brandished her lean arms, while Pierron, annoyed at the\r\ndisturbance, strolled quietly away with the air of a husband who can\r\namuse himself with a good conscience, knowing that his wife also has\r\nher little amusements.\r\n\r\nOld Bonnemort set out at last, and Maheu decided to have a little fresh\r\nair after asking Maheude if she would come and join him down below.\r\nNo, she couldn\'t at all, it was nothing but drudgery with the little\r\nones; but perhaps she would, all the same; she would think about it:\r\nthey could easily find each other. When he got outside he hesitated,\r\nthen he went into the neighbours\' to see if Levaque was ready. There he\r\nfound Zacharie, who was waiting for Philom\xc3\xa9ne, and the Levaque woman\r\nstarted again on that everlasting subject of marriage, saying that\r\nshe was being made fun of and that she would have an explanation with\r\nMaheude once and for all. Was life worth living when one had to keep\r\none\'s daughter\'s fatherless children while she went off with her lover?\r\nPhilom\xc3\xa9ne quietly finished putting on her bonnet, and Zacharie took\r\nher off, saying that he was quite willing if his mother was willing.\r\nAs Levaque had already gone, Maheu referred his angry neighbour to his\r\nwife and hastened to depart. Bouteloup, who was finishing a fragment of\r\ncheese with both elbows on the table, obstinately refused the friendly\r\noffer of a glass. He would stay in the house like a good husband.\r\n\r\nGradually the settlement was emptied; all the men went off one behind\r\nthe other, while the girls, watching at the doors, set out in the\r\nopposite direction on the arms of their lovers. As her father turned\r\nthe corner of the church, Catherine perceived Chaval, and, hastening to\r\njoin him, they took together the Montsou road. And the mother remained\r\nalone, in the midst of her scattered children, without strength to\r\nleave her chair, where she was pouring out a second glass of boiling\r\ncoffee, which she drank in little sips. In the settlement there were\r\nonly the women left, inviting each other to finish the dregs of the\r\ncoffee-pots, around tables that were still warm and greasy with the\r\ndinner.\r\n\r\nMaheu had guessed that Levaque was at the Avantage, and he slowly\r\nwent down to Rasseneur\'s. In fact, behind the bar, in the little\r\ngarden shut in by a hedge, Levaque was having a game of skittles with\r\nsome mates. Standing by, and not playing, Father Bonnemort and old\r\nMouque were following the ball, so absorbed that they even forgot to\r\nnudge each other with their elbows. A burning sun struck down on them\r\nperpendicularly; there was only one streak of shade by the side of the\r\ninn; and \xc3\x89tienne was there drinking his glass before a table, annoyed\r\nbecause Souvarine had just left him to go up to his room. Nearly every\r\nSunday the engine-man shut himself up to write or to read.\r\n\r\n"Will you have a game?" asked Levaque of Maheu.\r\n\r\nBut he refused: it was too hot, he was already dying of thirst.\r\n\r\n"Rasseneur," called \xc3\x89tienne, "bring a glass, will you?"\r\n\r\nAnd turning towards Maheu:\r\n\r\n"I\'ll stand it, you know."\r\n\r\nThey now all treated each other familiarly. Rasseneur did not hurry\r\nhimself, he had to be called three times; and Madame Rasseneur at last\r\nbrought some lukewarm beer. The young man had lowered his voice to\r\ncomplain about the house: they were worthy people, certainly, people\r\nwith good ideas, but the beer was worthless and the soup abominable!\r\nHe would have changed his lodgings ten times over, only the thought of\r\nthe walk from Montsou held him back. One day or another he would go and\r\nlive with some family at the settlement.\r\n\r\n"Sure enough!" said Maheu in his slow voice, "sure enough, you would be\r\nbetter in a family."\r\n\r\nBut shouts now broke out. Levaque had overthrown all the skittles at\r\none stroke. Mouque and Bonnemort, with their faces towards the ground,\r\nin the midst of the tumult preserved a silence of profound approbation.\r\nAnd the joy at this stroke found vent in jokes, especially when the\r\nplayers perceived Mouquette\'s radiant face behind the hedge. She had\r\nbeen prowling about there for an hour, and at last ventured to come\r\nnear on hearing the laughter.\r\n\r\n"What! are you alone?" shouted Levaque. "Where are your sweethearts?"\r\n\r\n"My sweethearts! I\'ve stabled them," she replied, with a fine impudent\r\ngaiety. "I\'m looking for one."\r\n\r\nThey all offered themselves, throwing coarse chaff at her. She refused\r\nwith a gesture and laughed louder, playing the fine lady. Besides, her\r\nfather was watching the game without even taking his eyes from the\r\nfallen skittles.\r\n\r\n"Ah!" Levaque went on, throwing a look towards \xc3\x89tienne: "one can tell\r\nwhere you\'re casting sheep\'s eyes, my girl! You\'ll have to take him by\r\nforce."\r\n\r\nThen \xc3\x89tienne brightened up. It was in fact around him that the putter\r\nwas revolving. And he refused, amused indeed, but without having the\r\nleast desire for her. She remained planted behind the hedge for some\r\nminutes longer, looking at him with large fixed eyes; then she slowly\r\nwent away, and her face suddenly became serious as if she were overcome\r\nby the powerful sun.\r\n\r\nIn a low voice \xc3\x89tienne was again giving long explanations to Maheu\r\nregarding the necessity for the Montsou miners to establish a Provident\r\nFund. "Since the Company professes to leave us free," he repeated,\r\n"what is there to fear? We only have their pensions and they distribute\r\nthem according to their own idea, since they don\'t hold back any of our\r\npay. Well, it will be prudent to form, outside their good pleasure, an\r\nassociation of mutual help on which we can count at least in cases of\r\nimmediate need."\r\n\r\nAnd he gave details, and discussed the organization, promising to\r\nundertake the labour of it.\r\n\r\n"I am willing enough," said Maheu, at last convinced. "But there are\r\nthe others; get them to make up their minds."\r\n\r\nLevaque had won, and they left the skittles to empty their glasses. But\r\nMaheu refused to drink a second glass; he would see later on, the day\r\nwas not yet done. He was thinking about Pierron. Where could he be?\r\nNo doubt at the Lenfant Estaminet. And, having persuaded \xc3\x89tienne and\r\nLevaque, the three set out for Montsou, at the same moment that a new\r\nband took possession of the skittles at the Avantage.\r\n\r\nOn the road they had to pause at the Casimir Bar, and then at the\r\nEstaminet du Progr\xc3\xa9s. Comrades called them through the open doors, and\r\nthere was no way of refusing. Each time it was a glass, two if they\r\nwere polite enough to return the invitation. They remained there ten\r\nminutes, exchanging a few words, and then began again, a little farther\r\non, knowing the beer, with which they could fill themselves without any\r\nother discomfort than having to piss it out again in the same measure,\r\nas clear as rock water. At the Estaminet Lenfant they came right upon\r\nPierron, who was finishing his second glass, and who, in order not to\r\nrefuse to touch glasses, swallowed a third. They naturally drank theirs\r\nalso. Now there were four of them, and they set out to see if Zacharie\r\nwas not at the Estaminet Tison. It was empty, and they called for a\r\nglass, in order to wait for him a moment. Then they thought of the\r\nEstaminet Saint-\xc3\x89loi and accepted there a round from Captain Richomme.\r\nThen they rambled from bar to bar, without any pretext, simply saying\r\nthat they were having a stroll.\r\n\r\n"We must go to the Volcan!" suddenly said Levaque, who was getting\r\nexcited.\r\n\r\nThe others began to laugh, and hesitated. Then they accompanied their\r\ncomrade in the midst of the growing crowd. In the long narrow room of\r\nthe Volcan, on a platform raised at the end, five singers, the scum\r\nof the Lille prostitutes, were walking about, low-necked and with\r\nmonstrous gestures, and the customers gave ten sous when they desired\r\nto have one behind the stage. There was especially a number of putters\r\nand landers, even trammers of fourteen, all the youth of the pit,\r\ndrinking more gin than beer. A few old miners also ventured there, and\r\nthe worst husbands of the settlements, those whose households were\r\nfalling into ruin.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the band was seated round a little table, \xc3\x89tienne took\r\npossession of Levaque to explain to him his idea of the Provident\r\nFund. Like all new converts who have found a mission, he had become an\r\nobstinate propagandist.\r\n\r\n"Every member," he repeated, "could easily pay in twenty sous a month.\r\nAs these twenty sous accumulated they would form a nice little sum\r\nin four or five years, and when one has money one is ready, eh, for\r\nanything that turns up? Eh, what do you say to it?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve nothing to say against it," replied Levaque, with an abstracted\r\nair. "We will talk about it."\r\n\r\nHe was excited by an enormous blonde, and determined to remain behind\r\nwhen Maheu and Pierron, after drinking their glasses, set out without\r\nwaiting for a second song.\r\n\r\nOutside, \xc3\x89tienne who had gone with them found Mouquette, who seemed to\r\nbe following them. She was always there, looking at him with her large\r\nfixed eyes, laughing her good-natured laugh, as if to say: "Are you\r\nwilling?" The young man joked and shrugged his shoulders. Then, with a\r\ngesture of anger, she was lost in the crowd.\r\n\r\n"Where, then, is Chaval?" asked Pierron.\r\n\r\n"True!" said Maheu. "He must surely be at Piquette\'s. Let us go to\r\nPiquette\'s."\r\n\r\nBut as they all three arrived at the Estaminet Piquette, sounds of\r\na quarrel arrested them at the door; Zacharie with his fist was\r\nthreatening a thick-set phlegmatic Walloon nail-maker, while Chaval,\r\nwith his hands in his pockets, was looking on.\r\n\r\n"Hullo! there\'s Chaval," said Maheu quietly; "he is with Catherine."\r\n\r\nFor five long hours the putter and her lover had been walking about\r\nthe fair. All along the Montsou road, that wide road with low bedaubed\r\nhouses winding downhill, a crowd of people wandered up and down in the\r\nsun, like a trail of ants, lost in the flat, bare plain. The eternal\r\nblack mud had dried, a black dust was rising and floating about like a\r\nstorm-cloud.\r\n\r\nOn both sides the public-houses were crowded; there were rows of tables\r\nto the street, where stood a double rank of hucksters at stalls in\r\nthe open air, selling neck-handkerchiefs and looking-glasses for the\r\ngirls, knives and caps for the lads; to say nothing of sweetmeats,\r\nsugar-plums, and biscuits. In front of the church archery was going on.\r\nOpposite the Yards they were playing at bowls. At the corner of the\r\nJoiselle road, beside the Administration buildings, in a spot enclosed\r\nby fences, crowds were watching a cock-fight, two large red cocks,\r\narmed with steel spurs, their breasts torn and bleeding. Farther on, at\r\nMaigrat\'s, aprons and trousers were being won at billiards. And there\r\nwere long silences; the crowd drank and stuffed itself without a sound;\r\na mute indigestion of beer and fried potatoes was expanding in the\r\ngreat heat, still further increased by the frying-pans bubbling in the\r\nopen air.\r\n\r\nChaval bought a looking-glass for nineteen sous and a handkerchief\r\nfor three francs, to give to Catherine. At every turn they met Mouque\r\nand Bonnemort, who had come to the fair and, in meditative mood, were\r\nplodding heavily through it side by side. Another meeting made them\r\nangry; they caught sight of Jeanlin inciting B\xc3\xa9bert and Lydie to steal\r\nbottles of gin from an extemporized bar installed at the edge of an\r\nopen piece of ground. Catherine succeeded in boxing her brother\'s ears;\r\nthe little girl had already run away with a bottle. These imps of Satan\r\nwould certainly end in a prison. Then, as they arrived before another\r\nbar, the T\xc3\xaate-Coup\xc3\xa9e, it occurred to Chaval to take his sweetheart\r\nin to a competition of chaffinches which had been announced on the\r\ndoor for the past week. Fifteen nail-makers from the Marchiennes nail\r\nworks had responded to the appeal, each with a dozen cages; and the\r\ngloomy little cages in which the blinded finches sat motionless were\r\nalready hung upon a paling in the inn yard. It was a question as to\r\nwhich, in the course of an hour, should repeat the phrase of its song\r\nthe greatest number of times. Each nail-maker with a slate stood near\r\nhis cages to mark, watching his neighbours and watched by them. And\r\nthe chaffinches had begun, the _chichou\xc3\xafeux_ with the deeper\r\nnote, the _batisecouics_ with their shriller note, all at first\r\ntimid, and only risking a rare phrase, then, excited by each other\'s\r\nsongs, increasing the pace; then at last carried away by such a rage\r\nof rivalry that they would even fall dead. The nail-makers violently\r\nwhipped them on with their voices, shouting out to them in Walloon to\r\nsing more, still more, yet a little more, while the spectators, about\r\na hundred people, stood by in mute fascination in the midst of this\r\ninfernal music of a hundred and eighty chaffinches all repeating the\r\nsame cadence out of time. It was a _batisecouic_ which gained the\r\nfirst prize, a metal coffee-pot.\r\n\r\nCatherine and Chaval were there when Zacharie and Philom\xc3\xa9ne entered.\r\nThey shook hands, and all stayed together. But suddenly Zacharie\r\nbecame angry, for he discovered that a nail-maker, who had come in\r\nwith his mates out of curiosity, was pinching his sister\'s thigh. She\r\nblushed and tried to make him be silent, trembling at the idea that all\r\nthese nail-makers would throw themselves on Chaval and kill him if he\r\nobjected to her being pinched. She had felt the pinch, but said nothing\r\nout of prudence. Her lover, however, merely made a grimace, and as they\r\nall four now went out the affair seemed to be finished. But hardly\r\nhad they entered Piquette\'s to drink a glass, when the nail-maker\r\nreappeared, making fun of them and coming close up to them with an air\r\nof provocation. Zacharie, insulted in his good family feelings, threw\r\nhimself on the insolent intruder.\r\n\r\n"That\'s my sister, you swine! Just wait a bit, and I\'m damned if I\r\ndon\'t make you respect her."\r\n\r\nThe two men were separated, while Chaval, who was quite calm, only\r\nrepeated:\r\n\r\n"Let be! it\'s my concern. I tell you I don\'t care a damn for him."\r\n\r\nMaheu now arrived with his party, and quieted Catherine and Philom\xc3\xa9ne\r\nwho were in tears. The nail-maker had disappeared, and there was\r\nlaughter in the crowd. To bring the episode to an end, Chaval, who\r\nwas at home at the Estaminet Piquette, called for drinks. \xc3\x89tienne had\r\ntouched glasses with Catherine, and all drank together--the father,\r\nthe daughter and her lover, the son and his mistress--saying politely:\r\n"To your good health!" Pierron afterwards persisted in paying for more\r\ndrinks. And they were all in good humour, when Zacharie grew wild again\r\nat the sight of his comrade Mouquet, and called him, as he said, to go\r\nand finish his affair with the nail-maker.\r\n\r\n"I shall have to go and do for him! Here, Chaval, keep Philom\xc3\xa9ne with\r\nCatherine. I\'m coming back."\r\n\r\nMaheu offered drinks in his turn. After all, if the lad wished to\r\navenge his sister it was not a bad example. But as soon as she had seen\r\nMouquet, Philom\xc3\xa9ne felt at rest, and nodded her head. Sure enough the\r\ntwo chaps would be off to the Volcan!\r\n\r\nOn the evenings of feast-days the fair was terminated in the ball-room\r\nof the Bon-Joyeux. It was a widow, Madame D\xc3\xa9sir, who kept this\r\nball-room, a fat matron of fifty, as round as a tub, but so fresh that\r\nshe still had six lovers, one for every day of the week, she said, and\r\nthe six together for Sunday. She called all the miners her children;\r\nand grew tender at the thought of the flood of beer which she had\r\npoured out for them during the last thirty years; and she boasted also\r\nthat a putter never became pregnant without having first stretched her\r\nlegs at her establishment. There were two rooms in the Bon-Joyeux: the\r\nbar which contained the counter and tables; then, communicating with\r\nit on the same floor by a large arch, was the ball-room, a large hall\r\nonly planked in the middle, being paved with bricks round the sides.\r\nIt was decorated with two garlands of paper flowers which crossed one\r\nanother, and were united in the middle by a crown of the same flowers;\r\nwhile along the walls were rows of gilt shields bearing the names of\r\nsaints--St. \xc3\x89loi, patron of the iron-workers; St. Crispin, patron of\r\nthe shoemakers; St. Barbara, patron of the miners; the whole calendar\r\nof corporations. The ceiling was so low that the three musicians on\r\ntheir platform, which was about the size of a pulpit, knocked their\r\nheads against it. When it became dark four petroleum lamps were\r\nfastened to the four corners of the room.\r\n\r\nOn this Sunday there was dancing from five o\'clock with the full\r\ndaylight through the windows, but it was not until towards seven\r\nthat the rooms began to fill. Outside, a gale was rising, blowing\r\ngreat black showers of dust which blinded people and sleeted into\r\nthe frying-pans. Maheu, \xc3\x89tienne, and Pierron, having come in to sit\r\ndown, had found Chaval at the Bon-Joyeux dancing with Catherine, while\r\nPhilom\xc3\xa9ne by herself was looking on. Neither Levaque nor Zacharie had\r\nreappeared. As there were no benches around the ball-room, Catherine\r\ncame after each dance to rest at her father\'s table. They called\r\nPhilom\xc3\xa9ne, but she preferred to stand up. The twilight was coming on;\r\nthe three musicians played furiously; one could only see in the hall\r\nthe movement of hips and breasts in the midst of a confusion of arms.\r\nThe appearance of the four lamps was greeted noisily, and suddenly\r\neverything was lit up--the red faces, the dishevelled hair sticking\r\nto the skin, the flying skirts spreading abroad the strong odour of\r\nperspiring couples. Maheu pointed out Mouquette to \xc3\x89tienne: she was as\r\nround and greasy as a bladder of lard, revolving violently in the arms\r\nof a tall, lean lander. She had been obliged to console herself and\r\ntake a man.\r\n\r\nAt last, at eight o\'clock, Maheude appeared with Estelle at her breast,\r\nfollowed by Alzire, Henri, and L\xc3\xa9nore. She had come there straight\r\nto her husband without fear of missing him. They could sup later on;\r\nas yet nobody was hungry, with their stomachs soaked in coffee and\r\nthickened with beer. Other women came in, and they whispered together\r\nwhen they saw, behind Maheude, the Levaque woman enter with Bouteloup,\r\nwho led in by the hand Achille and D\xc3\xa9sir\xc3\xa9e, Philom\xc3\xa9ne\'s little ones.\r\nThe two neighbours seemed to be getting on well together, one turning\r\nround to chat with the other. On the way there had been a great\r\nexplanation, and Maheude had resigned herself to Zacharie\'s marriage,\r\nin despair at the loss of her eldest son\'s wages, but overcome by the\r\nthought that she could not hold it back any longer without injustice.\r\nShe was trying, therefore, to put a good face on it, though with an\r\nanxious heart, as a housekeeper who was asking herself how she could\r\nmake both ends meet now that the best part of her purse was going.\r\n\r\n"Place yourself there, neighbour," she said, pointing to a table near\r\nthat where Maheu was drinking with \xc3\x89tienne and Pierron.\r\n\r\n"Is not my husband with you?" asked the Levaque woman.\r\n\r\nThe others told her that he would soon come. They were all seated\r\ntogether in a heap, Bouteloup and the youngsters so tightly squeezed\r\namong the drinkers that the two tables only formed one. There was a\r\ncall for drinks. Seeing her mother and her children Philom\xc3\xa9ne had\r\ndecided to come near. She accepted a chair, and seemed pleased to hear\r\nthat she was at last to be married; then, as they were looking for\r\nZacharie, she replied in her soft voice:\r\n\r\n"I am waiting for him; he is over there."\r\n\r\nMaheu had exchanged a look with his wife. She had then consented? He\r\nbecame serious and smoked in silence. He also felt anxiety for the\r\nmorrow in face of the ingratitude of these children, who got married\r\none by one leaving their parents in wretchedness.\r\n\r\nThe dancing still went on, and the end of a quadrille drowned the\r\nball-room in red dust; the walls cracked, a cornet produced shrill\r\nwhistling sounds like a locomotive in distress; and when the dancers\r\nstopped they were smoking like horses.\r\n\r\n"Do you remember?" said the Levaque woman, bending towards Maheude\'s\r\near; "you talked of strangling Catherine if she did anything foolish!"\r\n\r\nChaval brought Catherine back to the family table, and both of them\r\nstanding behind the father finished their glasses.\r\n\r\n"Bah!" murmured Maheude, with an air of resignation, "one says things\r\nlike that--. But what quiets me is that she will not have a child; I\r\nfeel sure of that. You see if she is confined, and obliged to marry,\r\nwhat shall we do for a living then?"\r\n\r\nNow the cornet was whistling a polka, and as the deafening noise began\r\nagain, Maheu, in a low voice, communicated an idea to his wife. Why\r\nshould they not take a lodger? \xc3\x89tienne, for example, who was looking\r\nout for quarters? They would have room since Zacharie was going to\r\nleave them, and the money that they would lose in that direction would\r\nbe in part regained in the other. Maheude\'s face brightened; certainly\r\nit was a good idea, it must be arranged. She seemed to be saved from\r\nstarvation once more, and her good humour returned so quickly that she\r\nordered a new round of drinks.\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne, meanwhile, was seeking to indoctrinate Pierron, to whom he was\r\nexplaining his plan of a Provident Fund. He had made him promise to\r\nsubscribe, when he was imprudent enough to reveal his real aim.\r\n\r\n"And if we go out on strike you can see how useful that fund will be.\r\nWe can snap our fingers at the Company, we shall have there a fund to\r\nfight against them. Eh? don\'t you think so?"\r\n\r\nPierron lowered his eyes and grew pale; he stammered:\r\n\r\n"I\'ll think over it. Good conduct, that\'s the best Provident Fund."\r\n\r\nThen Maheu took possession of \xc3\x89tienne, and squarely, like a good man,\r\nproposed to take him as a lodger. The young man accepted at once,\r\nanxious to live in the settlement with the idea of being nearer to his\r\nmates. The matter was settled in three words, Maheude declaring that\r\nthey would wait for the marriage of the children.\r\n\r\nJust then, Zacharie at last came back, with Mouquet and Levaque. The\r\nthree brought in the odours of the Volcan, a breath of gin, a musky\r\nacidity of ill-kept girls. They were very tipsy and seemed well pleased\r\nwith themselves, digging their elbows into each other and grinning.\r\nWhen he knew that he was at last to be married Zacharie began to laugh\r\nso loudly that he choked. Philom\xc3\xa9ne peacefully declared that she would\r\nrather see him laugh than cry. As there were no more chairs, Bouteloup\r\nhad moved so as to give up half of his to Levaque. And the latter,\r\nsuddenly much affected by realizing that the whole family party was\r\nthere, once more had beer served out.\r\n\r\n"By the Lord! we don\'t amuse ourselves so often!" he roared.\r\n\r\nThey remained there till ten o\'clock. Women continued to arrive, either\r\nto join or to take away their men; bands of children followed in rows,\r\nand the mothers no longer troubled themselves, pulling out their long\r\npale breasts, like sacks of oats, and smearing their chubby babies with\r\nmilk; while the little ones who were already able to walk, gorged with\r\nbeer and on all fours beneath the table, relieved themselves without\r\nshame. It was a rising sea of beer, from Madame D\xc3\xa9sir\'s disembowelled\r\nbarrels, the beer enlarged every belly, flowing from noses, eyes, and\r\neverywhere. So puffed out was the crowd that every one had a shoulder\r\nor knee poking into his neighbour; all were cheerful and merry in thus\r\nfeeling each other\'s elbows. A continuous laugh kept their mouths open\r\nfrom ear to ear. The heat was like an oven; they were roasting and felt\r\nthemselves at ease with glistening skin, gilded in a thick smoke from\r\nthe pipes; the only discomfort was when one had to move away; from time\r\nto time a girl rose, went to the other end, near the pump, lifted her\r\nclothes, and then came back. Beneath the garlands of painted paper the\r\ndancers could no longer see each other, they perspired so much; this\r\nencouraged the trammers to tumble the putters over, catching them at\r\nrandom by the hips. But where a girl tumbled with a man over her, the\r\ncornet covered their fall with its furious music; the swirl of feet\r\nwrapped them round as if the ball had collapsed upon them.\r\n\r\nSomeone who was passing warned Pierron that his daughter Lydie was\r\nsleeping at the door, across the pavement. She had drunk her share\r\nof the stolen bottle and was tipsy. He had to carry her away in his\r\narms while Jeanlin and B\xc3\xa9bert, who were more sober, followed him\r\nbehind, thinking it a great joke. This was the signal for departure,\r\nand several families came out of the Bon-Joyeux, the Maheus and the\r\nLevaques deciding to return to the settlement. At the same moment\r\nFather Bonnemort and old Mouque also left Montsou, walking in the\r\nsame somnambulistic manner, preserving the obstinate silence of their\r\nrecollections. And they all went back together, passing for the last\r\ntime through the fair, where the frying-pans were coagulating, and by\r\nthe estaminets, from which the last glasses were flowing in a stream\r\ntowards the middle of the road. The storm was still threatening, and\r\nsounds of laughter arose as they left the lighted houses to lose\r\nthemselves in the dark country around. Panting breaths arose from the\r\nripe wheat; many children must have been made on that night. They\r\narrived in confusion at the settlement. Neither the Levaques nor the\r\nMaheus supped with appetite, and the latter kept on dropping off to\r\nsleep while finishing their morning\'s boiled beef.\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne had led away Chaval for one more drink at Rasseneur\'s.\r\n\r\n"I am with you!" said Chaval, when his mate had explained the matter of\r\nthe Provident Fund. "Put it there! you\'re a fine fellow!"\r\n\r\nThe beginning of drunkenness was flaming in \xc3\x89tienne\'s eyes. He\r\nexclaimed:\r\n\r\n"Yes, let\'s join hands. As for me, you know I would give up everything\r\nfor the sake of justice, both drink and girls. There\'s only one thing\r\nthat warms my heart, and that is the thought that we are going to sweep\r\naway these bourgeois."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nTowards the middle of August, \xc3\x89tienne settled with the Maheus, Zacharie\r\nhaving married and obtained from the Company a vacant house in the\r\nsettlement for Philom\xc3\xa9ne and the two children. During the first days,\r\nthe young man experienced some constraint in the presence of Catherine.\r\nThere was a constant intimacy, as he everywhere replaced the elder\r\nbrother, sharing Jeanlin\'s bed over against the big sister\'s. Going to\r\nbed and getting up he had to dress and undress near her, and see her\r\ntake off and put on her garments. When the last skirt fell from her,\r\nshe appeared of pallid whiteness, that transparent snow of anaemic\r\nblondes; and he experienced a constant emotion in finding her, with\r\nhands and face already spoilt, as white as if dipped in milk from her\r\nheels to her neck, where the line of tan stood out sharply like a\r\nnecklace of amber. He pretended to turn away; but little by little he\r\nknew her: the feet at first which his lowered eyes met; then a glimpse\r\nof a knee when she slid beneath the coverlet; then her bosom with\r\nlittle rigid breasts as she leant over the bowl in the morning. She\r\nwould hasten without looking at him, and in ten seconds was undressed\r\nand stretched beside Alzire, with so supple and snake-like a movement\r\nthat he had scarcely taken off his shoes when she disappeared, turning\r\nher back and only showing her heavy knot of hair.\r\n\r\nShe never had any reason to be angry with him. If a sort of obsession\r\nmade him watch her in spite of himself at the moment when she lay down,\r\nhe avoided all practical jokes or dangerous pastimes. The parents were\r\nthere, and besides he still had for her a feeling, half of friendship\r\nand half of spite, which prevented him from treating her as a girl to\r\nbe desired, in the midst of the abandonment of their now common life in\r\ndressing, at meals, during work, where nothing of them remained secret,\r\nnot even their most intimate needs. All the modesty of the family had\r\ntaken refuge in the daily bath, for which the young girl now went\r\nupstairs alone, while the men bathed below one after the other.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the first month, \xc3\x89tienne and Catherine seemed no longer\r\nto see each other when in the evening, before extinguishing the candle,\r\nthey moved about the room, undressed. She had ceased to hasten, and\r\nresumed her old custom of doing up her hair at the edge of her bed,\r\nwhile her arms, raised in the air, lifted her chemise to her thighs,\r\nand he, without his trousers, sometimes helped her, looking for the\r\nhairpins that she had lost. Custom killed the shame of being naked;\r\nthey found it natural to be like this, for they were doing no harm, and\r\nit was not their fault if there was only one room for so many people.\r\nSometimes, however, a trouble came over them suddenly, at moments when\r\nthey had no guilty thought. After some nights when he had not seen\r\nher pale body, he suddenly saw her white all over, with a whiteness\r\nwhich shook him with a shiver, which obliged him to turn away for fear\r\nof yielding to the desire to take her. On other evenings, without\r\nany apparent reason, she would be overcome by a panic of modesty and\r\nhasten to slip between the sheets as if she felt the hands of this lad\r\nseizing her. Then, when the candle was out, they both knew that they\r\nwere not sleeping but were thinking of each other in spite of their\r\nweariness. This made them restless and sulky all the following day;\r\nthey liked best the tranquil evenings when they could behave together\r\nlike comrades.\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne only complained of Jeanlin, who slept curled up. Alzire\r\nslept lightly, and L\xc3\xa9nore and Henri were found in the morning, in\r\neach other\'s arms, exactly as they had gone to sleep. In the dark\r\nhouse there was no other sound than the snoring of Maheu and Maheude,\r\nrolling out at regular intervals like a forge bellows. On the whole,\r\n\xc3\x89tienne was better off than at Rasseneur\'s; the bed was tolerable and\r\nthe sheets were changed every month. He had better soup, too, and\r\nonly suffered from the rarity of meat. But they were all in the same\r\ncondition, and for forty-five francs he could not demand rabbit to\r\nevery meal. These forty-five francs helped the family and enabled them\r\nto make both ends meet, though always leaving some small debts and\r\narrears; so the Maheus were grateful to their lodger; his linen was\r\nwashed and mended, his buttons sewn on, and his affairs kept in order;\r\nin fact he felt all around him a woman\'s neatness and care.\r\n\r\nIt was at this time that \xc3\x89tienne began to understand the ideas\r\nthat were buzzing in his brain. Up till then he had only felt an\r\ninstinctive revolt in the midst of the inarticulate fermentation among\r\nhis mates. All sorts of confused questions came before him: Why are\r\nsome miserable? why are others rich? why are the former beneath the\r\nheel of the latter without hope of ever taking their place? And his\r\nfirst stage was to understand his ignorance. A secret shame, a hidden\r\nannoyance, gnawed him from that time; he knew nothing, he dared not\r\ntalk about these things which were working in him like a passion--the\r\nequality of all men, and the equity which demanded a fair division\r\nof the earth\'s wealth. He thus took to the methodless study of those\r\nwho in ignorance feel the fascination of knowledge. He now kept up a\r\nregular correspondence with Pluchart, who was better educated than\r\nhimself and more advanced in the Socialist movement. He had books sent\r\nto him, and his ill-digested reading still further excited his brain,\r\nespecially a medical book entitled _Hygi\xc3\xa9ne du Mineur_, in which\r\na Belgian doctor had summed up the evils of which the people in coal\r\nmines were dying; without counting treatises on political economy,\r\nincomprehensible in their technical dryness, Anarchist pamphlets which\r\nupset his ideas, and old numbers of newspapers which he preserved as\r\nirrefutable arguments for possible discussions. Souvarine also lent him\r\nbooks, and the work on Co-operative Societies had made him dream for a\r\nmonth of a universal exchange association abolishing money and basing\r\nthe whole social life on work. The shame of his ignorance left him, and\r\na certain pride came to him now that he felt himself thinking.\r\n\r\nDuring these first months \xc3\x89tienne retained the ecstasy of a novice; his\r\nheart was bursting with generous indignation against the oppressors,\r\nand looking forward to the approaching triumph of the oppressed.\r\nHe had not yet manufactured a system, his reading had been too\r\nvague. Rasseneur\'s practical demands were mixed up in his mind with\r\nSouvarine\'s violent and destructive methods, and when he came out of\r\nthe Avantage, where he was to be found nearly every day railing with\r\nthem against the Company, he walked as if in a dream, assisting at\r\na radical regeneration of nations to be effected without one broken\r\nwindow or a single drop of blood. The methods of execution remained\r\nobscure; he preferred to think that things would go very well, for\r\nhe lost his head as soon as he tried to formulate a programme of\r\nreconstruction. He even showed himself full of illogical moderation;\r\nhe often said that we must banish politics from the social question, a\r\nphrase which he had read and which seemed a useful one to repeat among\r\nthe phlegmatic colliers with whom he lived.\r\n\r\nEvery evening now, at the Maheus\', they delayed half an hour before\r\ngoing up to bed. \xc3\x89tienne always introduced the same subject. As his\r\nnature became more refined he found himself wounded by the promiscuity\r\nof the settlement. Were they beasts to be thus penned together in the\r\nmidst of the fields, so tightly packed that one could not change one\'s\r\nshirt without exhibiting one\'s backside to the neighbours? And how\r\nbad it was for health; and boys and girls were forced to grow corrupt\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n"Lord!" replied Maheu, "if there were more money there would be more\r\ncomfort. All the same it\'s true enough that it\'s good for no one to\r\nlive piled up like that. It always ends with making the men drunk and\r\nthe girls big-bellied."\r\n\r\nAnd the family began to talk, each having his say, while the petroleum\r\nlamp vitiated the air of the room, already stinking of fried onion. No,\r\nlife was certainly not a joke. One had to work like a brute at labour\r\nwhich was once a punishment for convicts; one left one\'s skin there\r\noftener than was one\'s turn, all that without even getting meat on the\r\ntable in the evening. No doubt one had one\'s feed; one ate, indeed, but\r\nso little, just enough to suffer without dying, overcome with debts and\r\npursued as if one had stolen the bread. When Sunday came one slept from\r\nweariness. The only pleasures were to get drunk and to get a child with\r\none\'s wife; then the beer swelled the belly, and the child, later on,\r\nleft you to go to the dogs. No, it was certainly not a joke.\r\n\r\nThen Maheude joined in.\r\n\r\n"The bother is, you see, when you have to say to yourself that it won\'t\r\nchange. When you\'re young you think that happiness will come some time,\r\nyou hope for things; and then the wretchedness begins always over\r\nagain, and you get shut up in it. Now, I don\'t wish harm to any one,\r\nbut there are times when this injustice makes me mad."\r\n\r\nThere was silence; they were all breathing with the vague discomfort\r\nof this closed-in horizon. Father Bonnemort only, if he was there,\r\nopened his eyes with surprise, for in his time people used not to worry\r\nabout things; they were born in the coal and they hammered at the seam,\r\nwithout asking for more; while now there was an air stirring which made\r\nthe colliers ambitious.\r\n\r\n"It don\'t do to spit at anything," he murmured. "A good glass is a good\r\nglass. As to the masters, they\'re often rascals; but there always will\r\nbe masters, won\'t there? What\'s the use of racking your brains over\r\nthose things?"\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne at once became animated. What! The worker was to be forbidden\r\nto think! Why! that was just it; things would change now because the\r\nworker had begun to think. In the old man\'s time the miner lived in\r\nthe mine like a brute, like a machine for extracting coal, always\r\nunder the earth, with ears and eyes stopped to outward events. So\r\nthe rich, who governed, found it easy to sell him and buy him, and\r\nto devour his flesh; he did not even know what was going on. But now\r\nthe miner was waking up down there, germinating in the earth just as\r\na grain germinates; and some fine day he would spring up in the midst\r\nof the fields: yes, men would spring up, an army of men who would\r\nre-establish justice. Is it not true that all citizens are equal since\r\nthe Revolution, because they vote together? Why should the worker\r\nremain the slave of the master who pays him? The big companies with\r\ntheir machines were crushing everything, and one no longer had against\r\nthem the ancient guarantees when people of the same trade, united in a\r\nbody, were able to defend themselves. It was for that, by God, and for\r\nno other reason, that all would burst up one day, thanks to education.\r\nOne had only to look into the settlement itself: the grandfathers could\r\nnot sign their names, the fathers could do so, and as for the sons,\r\nthey read and wrote like schoolmasters. Ah! it was springing up, it was\r\nspringing up, little by little, a rough harvest of men who would ripen\r\nin the sun! From the moment when they were no longer each of them stuck\r\nto his place for his whole existence, and when they had the ambition to\r\ntake a neighbour\'s place, why should they not hit out with their fists\r\nand try for the mastery?\r\n\r\nMaheu was shaken but remained full of doubts.\r\n\r\n"As soon as you move they give you back your certificate," he said.\r\n"The old man is right; it will always be the miner who gets all the\r\ntrouble, without a chance of a leg of mutton now and then as a reward."\r\n\r\nMaheude, who had been silent for a while, awoke as from a dream.\r\n\r\n"But if what the priests tell is true, if the poor people in this world\r\nbecome the rich ones in the next!"\r\n\r\nA burst of laughter interrupted her; even the children shrugged their\r\nshoulders, being incredulous in the open air, keeping a secret fear of\r\nghosts in the pit, but glad of the empty sky.\r\n\r\n"Ah! bosh! the priests!" exclaimed Maheu. "If they believed that,\r\nthey\'d eat less and work more, so as to reserve a better place for\r\nthemselves up there. No, when one\'s dead, one\'s dead."\r\n\r\nMaheude sighed deeply.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Lord, Lord!"\r\n\r\nThen her hands fell on to her knees with a gesture of immense dejection:\r\n\r\n"Then if that\'s true, we are done for, we are."\r\n\r\nThey all looked at one another. Father Bonnemort spat into his\r\nhandkerchief, while Maheu sat with his extinguished pipe, which he had\r\nforgotten, in his mouth. Alzire listened between L\xc3\xa9nore and Henri,\r\nwho were sleeping on the edge of the table. But Catherine, with her\r\nchin in her hand, never took her large clear eyes off \xc3\x89tienne while he\r\nwas protesting, declaring his faith, and opening out the enchanting\r\nfuture of his social dream. Around them the settlement was asleep; one\r\nonly heard the stray cries of a child or the complaints of a belated\r\ndrunkard. In the parlour the clock ticked slowly, and a damp freshness\r\narose from the sanded floor in spite of the stuffy air.\r\n\r\n"Fine ideas!" said the young man; "why do you need a good God and his\r\nparadise to make you happy? Haven\'t you got it in your own power to\r\nmake yourselves happy on earth?"\r\n\r\nWith his enthusiastic voice he spoke on and on. The closed horizon was\r\nbursting out; a gap of light was opening in the sombre lives of these\r\npoor people. The eternal wretchedness, beginning over and over again,\r\nthe brutalizing labour, the fate of a beast who gives his wool and\r\nhas his throat cut, all the misfortune disappeared, as though swept\r\naway by a great flood of sunlight; and beneath the dazzling gleam of\r\nfairyland justice descended from heaven. Since the good God was dead,\r\njustice would assure the happiness of men, and equality and brotherhood\r\nwould reign. A new society would spring up in a day just as in dreams,\r\nan immense town with the splendour of a mirage, in which each citizen\r\nlived by his work, and took his share in the common joys. The old\r\nrotten world had fallen to dust; a young humanity purged from its\r\ncrimes formed but a single nation of workers, having for their motto:\r\n"To each according to his deserts, and to each desert according to its\r\nperformance." And this dream grew continually larger and more beautiful\r\nand more seductive as it mounted higher in the impossible.\r\n\r\nAt first Maheude refused to listen, possessed by a deep dread. No, no,\r\nit was too beautiful; it would not do to embark upon these ideas, for\r\nthey made life seem abominable afterwards, and one would have destroyed\r\neverything in the effort to be happy. When she saw Maheu\'s eyes shine,\r\nand that he was troubled and won over, she became restless, and\r\nexclaimed, interrupting \xc3\x89tienne:\r\n\r\n"Don\'t listen, my man! You can see he\'s only telling us fairy-tales. Do\r\nyou think the bourgeois would ever consent to work as we do?"\r\n\r\nBut little by little the charm worked on her also. Her imagination was\r\naroused and she smiled at last, entering his marvellous world of hope.\r\nIt was so sweet to forget for a while the sad reality! When one lives\r\nlike the beasts with face bent towards the earth, one needs a corner\r\nof falsehood where one can amuse oneself by regaling on the things one\r\nwill never possess. And what made her enthusiastic and brought her into\r\nagreement with the young man was the idea of justice.\r\n\r\n"Now, there you\'re right!" she exclaimed. "When a thing\'s just I don\'t\r\nmind being cut to pieces for it. And it\'s true enough! it would be just\r\nfor us to have a turn."\r\n\r\nThen Maheu ventured to become excited.\r\n\r\n"Blast it all! I am not rich, but I would give five francs to keep\r\nalive to see that. What a hustling, eh? Will it be soon? And how can we\r\nset about it?"\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne began talking again. The old social system was cracking; it\r\ncould not last more than a few months, he affirmed roundly. As to the\r\nmethods of execution, he spoke more vaguely, mixing up his reading,\r\nand fearing before ignorant hearers to enter on explanations where he\r\nmight lose himself. All the systems had their share in it, softened by\r\nthe certainty of easy triumph, a universal kiss which would bring to an\r\nend all class misunderstandings; without taking count, however, of the\r\nthick-heads among the masters and bourgeois whom it would perhaps be\r\nnecessary to bring to reason by force. And the Maheus looked as if they\r\nunderstood, approving and accepting miraculous solutions with the blind\r\nfaith of new believers, like those Christians of the early days of the\r\nChurch, who awaited the coming of a perfect society on the dunghill of\r\nthe ancient world. Little Alzire picked up a few words, and imagined\r\nhappiness under the form of a very warm house, where children could\r\nplay and eat as long as they liked. Catherine, without moving, her chin\r\nalways resting in her hand, kept her eyes fixed on \xc3\x89tienne, and when he\r\nstopped a slight shudder passed over her, and she was quite pale as if\r\nshe felt the cold.\r\n\r\nBut Maheude looked at the clock.\r\n\r\n"Past nine! Can it be possible? We shall never get up to-morrow."\r\n\r\nAnd the Maheus left the table with hearts ill at ease and in despair.\r\nIt seemed to them that they had just been rich and that they had now\r\nsuddenly fallen back into the mud. Father Bonnemort, who was setting\r\nout for the pit, growled that those sort of stories wouldn\'t make the\r\nsoup better; while the others went upstairs in single file, noticing\r\nthe dampness of the walls and the pestiferous stuffiness of the air.\r\nUpstairs, amid the heavy slumber of the settlement when Catherine had\r\ngot into bed last and blown out the candle, \xc3\x89tienne heard her tossing\r\nfeverishly before getting to sleep.\r\n\r\nOften at these conversations the neighbours came in: Levaque, who\r\ngrew excited at the idea of a general sharing; Pierron, who prudently\r\nwent to bed as soon as they attacked the Company. At long intervals\r\nZacharie came in for a moment; but politics bored him, he preferred to\r\ngo off and drink a glass at the Avantage. As to Chaval, he would go to\r\nextremes and wanted to draw blood. Nearly every evening he passed an\r\nhour with the Maheus; in this assiduity there was a certain unconfessed\r\njealousy, the fear that he would be robbed of Catherine. This girl, of\r\nwhom he was already growing tired, had become precious to him now that\r\na man slept near her and could take her at night.\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne\'s influence increased; he gradually revolutionized the\r\nsettlement. His propaganda was unseen, and all the more sure since he\r\nwas growing in the estimation of all. Maheude, notwithstanding the\r\ncaution of a prudent housekeeper, treated him with consideration, as\r\na young man who paid regularly and neither drank nor gambled, with\r\nhis nose always in a book; she spread abroad his reputation among the\r\nneighbours as an educated lad, a reputation which they abused by asking\r\nhim to write their letters. He was a sort of business man, charged with\r\ncorrespondence and consulted by households in affairs of difficulty.\r\nSince September he had thus at last been able to establish his famous\r\nProvident Fund, which was still very precarious, only including the\r\ninhabitants of the settlement; but he hoped to be able to obtain the\r\nadhesion of the miners at all the pits, especially if the Company,\r\nwhich had remained passive, continued not to interfere. He had been\r\nmade secretary of the association and he even received a small salary\r\nfor the clerking. This made him almost rich. If a married miner can\r\nwith difficulty make both ends meet, a sober lad who has no burdens can\r\neven manage to save.\r\n\r\nFrom this time a slow transformation took place in \xc3\x89tienne. Certain\r\ninstincts of refinement and comfort which had slept during his poverty\r\nwere now revealed. He began to buy cloth garments; he also bought\r\na pair of elegant boots; he became a big man. The whole settlement\r\ngrouped round him. The satisfaction of his self-love was delicious;\r\nhe became intoxicated with this first enjoyment of popularity; to be\r\nat the head of others, to command, he who was so young, and but the\r\nday before had been a mere labourer, this filled him with pride, and\r\nenlarged his dream of an approaching revolution in which he was to play\r\na part. His face changed: he became serious and put on airs, while\r\nhis growing ambition inflamed his theories and pushed him to ideas of\r\nviolence.\r\n\r\nBut autumn was advancing, and the October cold had blighted the\r\nlittle gardens of the settlement. Behind the thin lilacs the trammers\r\nno longer tumbled the putters over on the shed, and only the winter\r\nvegetables remained, the cabbages pearled with white frost, the leeks\r\nand the salads. Once more the rains were beating down on the red tiles\r\nand flowing down into the tubs beneath the gutters with the sound of a\r\ntorrent. In every house the stove piled up with coal was never cold,\r\nand poisoned the close parlours. It was the season of wretchedness\r\nbeginning once more.\r\n\r\nIn October, on one of the first frosty nights, \xc3\x89tienne, feverish after\r\nhis conversation below, could not sleep. He had seen Catherine glide\r\nbeneath the coverlet and then blow out the candle. She also appeared\r\nto be quite overcome, and tormented by one of those fits of modesty\r\nwhich still made her hasten sometimes, and so awkwardly that she only\r\nuncovered herself more. In the darkness she lay as though dead; but\r\nhe knew that she also was awake, and he felt that she was thinking of\r\nhim just as he was thinking of her: this mute exchange of their beings\r\nhad never before filled them with such trouble. The minutes went by\r\nand neither he nor she moved, only their breathing was embarrassed in\r\nspite of their efforts to retain it. Twice over he was on the point of\r\nrising and taking her. It was idiotic to have such a strong desire for\r\neach other and never to satisfy it. Why should they thus sulk against\r\nwhat they desired? The children were asleep, she was quite willing; he\r\nwas certain that she was waiting for him, stifling, and that she would\r\nclose her arms round him in silence with clenched teeth. Nearly an hour\r\npassed. He did not go to take her, and she did not turn round for fear\r\nof calling him. The more they lived side by side, the more a barrier\r\nwas raised of shames, repugnancies, delicacies of friendship, which\r\nthey could not explain even to themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\n"Listen," said Maheude to her man, "when you go to Montsou for the pay,\r\njust bring me back a pound of coffee and a kilo of sugar."\r\n\r\nHe was sewing one of his shoes, in order to spare the cobbling.\r\n\r\n"Good!" he murmured, without leaving his task.\r\n\r\n"I should like you to go to the butcher\'s too. A bit of veal, eh? It\'s\r\nso long since we saw it."\r\n\r\nThis time he raised his head.\r\n\r\n"Do you think, then, that I\'ve got thousands coming in? The fortnight\'s\r\npay is too little as it is, with their confounded idea of always\r\nstopping work."\r\n\r\nThey were both silent. It was after breakfast, one Saturday, at the end\r\nof October. The Company, under the pretext of the derangement caused by\r\npayment, had on this day once more suspended output in all their pits.\r\nSeized by panic at the growing industrial crisis, and not wishing to\r\naugment their already considerable stock, they profited by the smallest\r\npretexts to force their ten thousand workers to rest.\r\n\r\n"You know that \xc3\x89tienne is waiting for you at Rasseneur\'s," began\r\nMaheude again. "Take him with you; he\'ll be more clever than you are in\r\nclearing up matters if they haven\'t counted all your hours."\r\n\r\nMaheu nodded approval.\r\n\r\n"And just talk to those gentlemen about your father\'s affair. The\r\ndoctor\'s on good terms with the directors. It\'s true, isn\'t it, old un,\r\nthat the doctor\'s mistaken, and that you can still work?"\r\n\r\nFor ten days Father Bonnemort, with benumbed paws, as he said, had\r\nremained nailed to his chair. She had to repeat her question, and he\r\ngrowled:\r\n\r\n"Sure enough, I can work. One isn\'t done for because one\'s legs are\r\nbad. All that is just stories they make up, so as not to give the\r\nhundred-and-eighty-franc pension."\r\n\r\nMaheude thought of the old man\'s forty sous, which he would, perhaps,\r\nnever bring in any more, and she uttered a cry of anguish:\r\n\r\n"My God! we shall soon be all dead if this goes on."\r\n\r\n"When one is dead," said Maheu, "one doesn\'t get hungry."\r\n\r\nHe put some nails into his shoes, and decided to set out. The\r\nDeux-Cent-Quarante settlement would not be paid till towards four\r\no\'clock. The men did not hurry, therefore, but waited about, going off\r\none by one, beset by the women, who implored them to come back at once.\r\nMany gave them commissions, to prevent them forgetting themselves in\r\npublic-houses.\r\n\r\nAt Rasseneur\'s \xc3\x89tienne had received news. Disquieting rumours were\r\nflying about; it was said that the Company were more and more\r\ndiscontented over the timbering. They were overwhelming the workmen\r\nwith fines, and a conflict appeared inevitable. That was, however, only\r\nthe avowed dispute; beneath it there were grave and secret causes of\r\ncomplication.\r\n\r\nJust as \xc3\x89tienne arrived, a comrade, who was drinking a glass on\r\nhis return from Montsou, was telling that an announcement had been\r\nstuck up at the cashier\'s; but he did not quite know what was on the\r\nannouncement. A second entered, then a third, and each brought a\r\ndifferent story. It seemed certain, however, that the Company had taken\r\na resolution.\r\n\r\n"What do you say about it, eh?" asked \xc3\x89tienne, sitting down near\r\nSouvarine at a table where nothing was to be seen but a packet of\r\ntobacco.\r\n\r\nThe engine-man did not hurry, but finished rolling his cigarette.\r\n\r\n"I say that it was easy to foresee. They want to push you to extremes."\r\n\r\nHe alone had a sufficiently keen intelligence to analyse the situation.\r\nHe explained it in his quiet way. The Company, suffering from the\r\ncrisis, had been forced to reduce their expenses if they were not to\r\nsuccumb, and it was naturally the workers who would have to tighten\r\ntheir bellies; under some pretext or another the Company would nibble\r\nat their wages. For two months the coal had been remaining at the\r\nsurface of their pits, and nearly all the workshops were resting. As\r\nthe Company did not dare to rest in this way, terrified at the ruinous\r\ninaction, they were meditating a middle course, perhaps a strike, from\r\nwhich the miners would come out crushed and worse paid. Then the new\r\nProvident Fund was disturbing them, as it was a threat for the future,\r\nwhile a strike would relieve them of it, by exhausting it when it was\r\nstill small.\r\n\r\nRasseneur had seated himself beside \xc3\x89tienne, and both of them were\r\nlistening in consternation. They could talk aloud, because there was no\r\none there but Madame Rasseneur, seated at the counter.\r\n\r\n"What an idea!" murmured the innkeeper; "what\'s the good of it? The\r\nCompany has no interest in a strike, nor the men either. It would be\r\nbest to come to an understanding."\r\n\r\nThis was very sensible. He was always on the side of reasonable\r\ndemands. Since the rapid popularity of his old lodger, he had even\r\nexaggerated this system of possible progress, saying they would\r\nobtain nothing if they wished to have everything at once. In his fat,\r\ngood-humoured nature, nourished on beer, a secret jealousy was forming,\r\nincreased by the desertion of his bar, into which the workmen from\r\nthe Voreux now came more rarely to drink and to listen; and he thus\r\nsometimes even began to defend the Company, forgetting the rancour of\r\nan old miner who had been turned off.\r\n\r\n"Then you are against the strike?" cried Madame Rasseneur, without\r\nleaving the counter.\r\n\r\nAnd as he energetically replied, "Yes!" she made him hold his tongue.\r\n\r\n"Bah! you have no courage; let these gentlemen speak."\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne was meditating, with his eyes fixed on the glass which she had\r\nserved to him. At last he raised his head.\r\n\r\n"I dare say it\'s all true what our mate tells us, and we must get\r\nresigned to this strike if they force it on us. Pluchart has just\r\nwritten me some very sensible things on this matter. He\'s against the\r\nstrike too, for the men would suffer as much as the masters, and it\r\nwouldn\'t come to anything decisive. Only it seems to him a capital\r\nchance to get our men to make up their minds to go into his big\r\nmachine. Here\'s his letter."\r\n\r\nIn fact, Pluchart, in despair at the suspicion which the International\r\naroused among the miners at Montsou, was hoping to see them enter in a\r\nmass if they were forced to fight against the Company. In spite of his\r\nefforts, \xc3\x89tienne had not been able to place a single member\'s card,\r\nand he had given his best efforts to his Provident Fund, which was\r\nmuch better received. But this fund was still so small that it would\r\nbe quickly exhausted, as Souvarine said, and the strikers would then\r\ninevitably throw themselves into the Working Men\'s Association so that\r\ntheir brothers in every country could come to their aid.\r\n\r\n"How much have you in the fund?" asked Rasseneur. "Hardly three\r\nthousand francs," replied \xc3\x89tienne, "and you know that the directors\r\nsent for me yesterday. Oh! they were very polite; they repeated that\r\nthey wouldn\'t prevent their men from forming a reserve fund. But I\r\nquite understood that they wanted to control it. We are bound to have a\r\nstruggle over that."\r\n\r\nThe innkeeper was walking up and down, whistling contemptuously. "Three\r\nthousand francs! what can you do with that! It wouldn\'t yield six days\'\r\nbread; and if we counted on foreigners, such as the people in England,\r\none might go to bed at once and turn up one\'s toes. No, it was too\r\nfoolish, this strike!"\r\n\r\nThen for the first time bitter words passed between these two men who\r\nusually agreed together at last, in their common hatred of capital.\r\n\r\n"We shall see! and you, what do you say about it?" repeated \xc3\x89tienne,\r\nturning towards Souvarine.\r\n\r\nThe latter replied with his usual phrase of habitual contempt.\r\n\r\n"A strike? Foolery!"\r\n\r\nThen, in the midst of the angry silence, he added gently:\r\n\r\n"On the whole, I shouldn\'t say no if it amuses you; it ruins the one\r\nside and kills the other, and that is always so much cleared away. Only\r\nin that way it will take quite a thousand years to renew the world.\r\nJust begin by blowing up this prison in which you are all being done to\r\ndeath!"\r\n\r\nWith his delicate hand he pointed out the Voreux, the buildings of\r\nwhich could be seen through the open door. But an unforeseen drama\r\ninterrupted him: Poland, the big tame rabbit, which had ventured\r\noutside, came bounding back, fleeing from the stones of a band of\r\ntrammers; and in her terror, with fallen ears and raised tail, she took\r\nrefuge against his legs, scratching and imploring him to take her up.\r\nWhen he had placed her on his knees, he sheltered her with both hands,\r\nand fell into that kind of dreamy somnolence into which the caress of\r\nthis soft warm fur always plunged him.\r\n\r\nAlmost at the same time Maheu came in. He would drink nothing, in spite\r\nof the polite insistence of Madame Rasseneur, who sold her beer as\r\nthough she made a present of it. \xc3\x89tienne had risen, and both of them\r\nset out for Montsou.\r\n\r\nOn pay-day at the Company\'s Yards, Montsou seemed to be in the midst of\r\na fete as on fine Sunday feast-days. Bands of miners arrived from all\r\nthe settlements. The cashier\'s office being very small, they preferred\r\nto wait at the door, stationed in groups on the pavement, barring the\r\nway in a crowd that was constantly renewed. Hucksters profited by the\r\noccasion and installed themselves with their movable stalls that sold\r\neven pottery and cooked meats. But it was especially the estaminets\r\nand the bars which did a good trade, for the miners before being paid\r\nwent to the counters to get patience, and returned to them to wet\r\ntheir pay as soon as they had it in their pockets. But they were very\r\nsensible, except when they finished it at the Volcan. As Maheu and\r\n\xc3\x89tienne advanced among the groups they felt that on that day a deep\r\nexasperation was rising up. It was not the ordinary indifference with\r\nwhich the money was taken and spent at the publics. Fists were clenched\r\nand violent words were passing from mouth to mouth.\r\n\r\n"Is it true, then," asked Maheu of Chaval, whom he met before the\r\nEstaminet Piquette, "that they\'ve played the dirty trick?"\r\n\r\nBut Chaval contented himself by replying with a furious growl, throwing\r\na sidelong look on \xc3\x89tienne. Since the working had been renewed he had\r\nhired himself on with others, more and more bitten by envy against this\r\ncomrade, the new-comer who posed as a boss and whose boots, as he said,\r\nwere licked by the whole settlement. This was complicated by a lover\'s\r\njealousy. He never took Catherine to R\xc3\xa9quillart now or behind the\r\npit-bank without accusing her in abominable language of sleeping with\r\nher mother\'s lodger; then, seized by savage desire, he would stifle her\r\nwith caresses.\r\n\r\nMaheu asked him another question:\r\n\r\n"Is it the Voreux\'s turn now?"\r\n\r\nAnd when he turned his back after nodding affirmatively, both men\r\ndecided to enter the Yards.\r\n\r\nThe counting-house was a small rectangular room, divided in two by a\r\ngrating. On the forms along the wall five or six miners were waiting;\r\nwhile the cashier assisted by a clerk was paying another who stood\r\nbefore the wicket with his cap in his hand. Above the form on the\r\nleft, a yellow placard was stuck up, quite fresh against the smoky\r\ngrey of the plaster, and it was in front of this that the men had\r\nbeen constantly passing all the morning. They entered two or three\r\nat a time, stood in front of it, and then went away without a word,\r\nshrugging their shoulders as if their backs were crushed.\r\n\r\nTwo colliers were just then standing in front of the announcement, a\r\nyoung one with a square brutish head and a very thin old one, his face\r\ndull with age. Neither of them could read; the young one spelt, moving\r\nhis lips, the old one contented himself with gazing stupidly. Many came\r\nin thus to look, without understanding.\r\n\r\n"Read us that there!" said Maheu, who was not very strong either in\r\nreading, to his companion.\r\n\r\nThen \xc3\x89tienne began to read him the announcement. It was a notice from\r\nthe Company to the miners of all the pits, informing them that in\r\nconsequence of the lack of care bestowed on the timbering, and being\r\nweary of inflicting useless fines, the Company had resolved to apply\r\na new method of payment for the extraction of coal. Henceforward they\r\nwould pay for the timbering separately, by the cubic metre of wood\r\ntaken down and used, based on the quantity necessary for good work.\r\nThe price of the tub of coal extracted would naturally be lowered, in\r\nthe proportion of fifty centimes to forty, according to the nature\r\nand distance of the cuttings, and a somewhat obscure calculation\r\nendeavoured to show that this diminution of ten centimes would be\r\nexactly compensated by the price of the timbering. The Company added\r\nalso that, wishing to leave every one time to convince himself of the\r\nadvantages presented by this new scheme, they did not propose to apply\r\nit till Monday, the 1st of December.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t read so loud over there," shouted the cashier. "We can\'t hear\r\nwhat we are saying."\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne finished reading without paying attention to this observation.\r\nHis voice trembled, and when he had reached the end they all continued\r\nto gaze steadily at the placard. The old miner and the young one looked\r\nas though they expected something more; then they went away with\r\ndepressed shoulders.\r\n\r\n"Good God!" muttered Maheu.\r\n\r\nHe and his companions sat down absorbed, with lowered heads, and while\r\nfiles of men continued to pass before the yellow paper they made\r\ncalculations. Were they being made fun of? They could never make up\r\nwith the timbering for the ten centimes taken off the tram. At most\r\nthey could only get to eight centimes, so the Company would be robbing\r\nthem of two centimes, without counting the time taken by careful work.\r\nThis, then, was what this disguised lowering of wages really came to.\r\nThe Company was economizing out of the miners\' pockets.\r\n\r\n"Good Lord! Good Lord!" repeated Maheu, raising his head. "We should be\r\nbloody fools if we took that."\r\n\r\nBut the wicket being free he went up to be paid. The heads only of the\r\nworkings presented themselves at the desk and then divided the money\r\nbetween their men to save time.\r\n\r\n"Maheu and associates," said the clerk, "Filonni\xc3\xa9re seam, cutting No.\r\n7."\r\n\r\nHe searched through the lists which were prepared from the inspection\r\nof the tickets on which the captains stated every day for each stall\r\nthe number of trams extracted. Then he repeated:\r\n\r\n"Maheu and associates, Filonni\xc3\xa9re seam, cutting No. 7. One hundred and\r\nthirty-five francs."\r\n\r\nThe cashier paid.\r\n\r\n"Beg pardon, sir," stammered the pikeman in surprise. "Are you sure you\r\nhave not made a mistake?"\r\n\r\nHe looked at this small sum of money without picking it up, frozen by\r\na shudder which went to his heart. It was true he was expecting bad\r\npayment, but it could not come to so little or he must have calculated\r\nwrong. When he had given their shares to Zacharie, \xc3\x89tienne, and the\r\nother mate who replaced Chaval, there would remain at most fifty francs\r\nfor himself, his father, Catherine, and Jeanlin.\r\n\r\n"No, no, I\'ve made no mistake," replied the clerk. "There are two\r\nSundays and four rest days to be taken off; that makes nine days of\r\nwork." Maheu followed this calculation in a low voice: nine days gave\r\nhim about thirty francs, eighteen to Catherine, nine to Jeanlin. As\r\nto Father Bonnemort, he only had three days. No matter, by adding the\r\nninety francs of Zacharie and the two mates, that would surely make\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n"And don\'t forget the fines," added the clerk. "Twenty francs for fines\r\nfor defective timbering."\r\n\r\nThe pikeman made a gesture of despair. Twenty francs of fines, four\r\ndays of rest! That made out the account. To think that he had once\r\nbrought back a fortnight\'s pay of full a hundred and fifty francs when\r\nFather Bonnemort was working and Zacharie had not yet set up house for\r\nhimself!\r\n\r\n"Well, are you going to take it?" cried the cashier impatiently. "You\r\ncan see there\'s someone else waiting. If you don\'t want it, say so."\r\n\r\nAs Maheu decided to pick up the money with his large trembling hand the\r\nclerk stopped him.\r\n\r\n"Wait: I have your name here. Toussaint Maheu, is it not? The general\r\nsecretary wishes to speak to you. Go in, he is alone."\r\n\r\nThe dazed workman found himself in an office furnished with old\r\nmahogany, upholstered with faded green rep. And he listened for five\r\nminutes to the general secretary, a tall sallow gentleman, who spoke\r\nto him over the papers of his bureau without rising. But the buzzing\r\nin his ears prevented him from hearing. He understood vaguely that the\r\nquestion of his father\'s retirement would be taken into consideration\r\nwith the pension of a hundred and fifty francs, fifty years of age\r\nand forty years\' service. Then it seemed to him that the secretary\'s\r\nvoice became harder. There was a reprimand; he was accused of occupying\r\nhimself with politics; an allusion was made to his lodger and the\r\nProvident Fund; finally he was advised not to compromise himself with\r\nthese follies, he, who was one of the best workmen in the mine. He\r\nwished to protest, but could only pronounce words at random, twisting\r\nhis cap between his feverish fingers, and he retired, stuttering:\r\n\r\n"Certainly, sir--I can assure you, sir----"\r\n\r\nOutside, when he had found \xc3\x89tienne who waiting for him, he broke out:\r\n\r\n"Well, I am a bloody fool, I ought to have replied! Not enough money to\r\nget bread, and insults as well! Yes, he has been talking against you;\r\nhe told me the settlement was being poisoned. And what\'s to be done?\r\nGood God! bend one\'s back and say thank you. He\'s right, that\'s the\r\nwisest plan."\r\n\r\nMaheu fell silent, overcome at once by rage and fear. \xc3\x89tienne was\r\ngloomily thinking. Once more they traversed the groups who blocked the\r\nroad. The exasperation was growing, the exasperation of a calm race,\r\nthe muttered warning of a storm, without violent gestures, terrible\r\nto see above this solid mass. A few men understanding accounts had\r\nmade calculations, and the two centimes gained by the Company over the\r\nwood were rumoured about, and excited the hardest heads. But it was\r\nespecially the rage over this disastrous pay, the rebellion of hunger\r\nagainst the rest days and the fines. Already there was not enough to\r\neat, and what would happen if wages were still further lowered? In the\r\nestaminets the anger grew loud, and fury so dried their throats that\r\nthe little money taken went over the counters.\r\n\r\nFrom Montsou to the settlement \xc3\x89tienne and Maheu never exchanged\r\na word. When the latter entered, Maheude, who was alone with the\r\nchildren, noticed immediately that his hands were empty.\r\n\r\n"Well, you\'re a nice one!" she said. "Where\'s my coffee and my sugar\r\nand the meat? A bit of veal wouldn\'t have ruined you."\r\n\r\nHe made no reply, stifled by the emotion he had been keeping back.\r\nThen the coarse face of this man hardened to work in the mines became\r\nswollen with despair, and large tears broke from his eyes and fell in\r\na warm rain. He had thrown himself into a chair, weeping like a child,\r\nand throwing fifty francs on the table:\r\n\r\n"Here," he stammered. "That\'s what I\'ve brought you back. That\'s our\r\nwork for all of us."\r\n\r\nMaheude looked at \xc3\x89tienne, and saw that he was silent and overwhelmed.\r\nThen she also wept. How were nine people to live for a fortnight on\r\nfifty francs? Her eldest son had left them, the old man could no longer\r\nmove his legs: it would soon mean death. Alzire threw herself round\r\nher mother\'s neck, overcome on hearing her weep. Estelle was howling,\r\nL\xc3\xa9nore and Henri were sobbing.\r\n\r\nAnd from the entire settlement there soon arose the same cry of\r\nwretchedness. The men had come back, and each household was lamenting\r\nthe disaster of this bad pay. The doors opened, women appeared, crying\r\naloud outside, as if their complaints could not be held beneath the\r\nceilings of these small houses. A fine rain was falling, but they did\r\nnot feel it, they called one another from the pavements, they showed\r\none another in the hollow of their hands the money they had received.\r\n\r\n"Look! they\'ve given him this. Do they want to make fools of people?"\r\n\r\n"As for me, see, I haven\'t got enough to pay for the fortnight\'s bread\r\nwith."\r\n\r\n"And just count mine! I should have to sell my shifts!"\r\n\r\nMaheude had come out like the others. A group had formed around the\r\nLevaque woman, who was shouting loudest of all, for her drunkard of\r\na husband had not even turned up, and she knew that, large or small,\r\nthe pay would melt away at the Volcan. Philom\xc3\xa9ne watched Maheu so that\r\nZacharie should not get hold of the money. Pierronne was the only one\r\nwho seemed fairly calm, for that sneak of a Pierron always arranged\r\nthings, no one knew how, so as to have more hours on the captain\'s\r\nticket than his mates. But Mother Brul\xc3\xa9 thought this cowardly of her\r\nson-in-law; she was among the enraged, lean and erect in the midst of\r\nthe group, with her fists stretched towards Montsou.\r\n\r\n"To think," she cried, without naming the Hennebeaus, "that this\r\nmorning I saw their servant go by in a carriage! Yes, the cook in\r\na carriage with two horses, going to Marchiennes to get fish, sure\r\nenough!"\r\n\r\nA clamour arose, and the abuse began again. That servant in a white\r\napron taken to the market of the neighbouring town in her master\'s\r\ncarriage aroused indignation. While the workers were dying of hunger\r\nthey must have their fish, at all costs! Perhaps they would not always\r\nbe able to eat their fish: the turn of the poor people would come.\r\nAnd the ideas sown by \xc3\x89tienne sprang up and expanded in this cry of\r\nrevolt. It was impatience before the promised age of gold, a haste to\r\nget a share of the happiness beyond this horizon of misery, closed in\r\nlike the grave. The injustice was becoming too great; at last they\r\nwould demand their rights, since the bread was being taken out of\r\ntheir mouths. The women especially would have liked at once to take by\r\nassault this ideal city of progress, in which there was to be no more\r\nwretchedness. It was almost night, and the rain increased while they\r\nwere still filling the settlement with their tears in the midst of the\r\nscreaming helter-skelter of the children.\r\n\r\nThat evening at the Avantage the strike was decided on. Rasseneur no\r\nlonger struggled against it, and Souvarine accepted it as a first step.\r\n\xc3\x89tienne summed up the situation in a word: if the Company really wanted\r\na strike then the Company should have a strike.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\nA week passed, and work went on suspiciously and mournfully in\r\nexpectation of the conflict.\r\n\r\nAmong the Maheus the fortnight threatened to be more meagre than\r\never. Maheude grew bitter, in spite of her moderation and good sense.\r\nHer daughter Catherine, too, had taken it into her head to stay out\r\none night. On the following morning she came back so weary and ill\r\nafter this adventure that she was not able to go to the pit; and she\r\ntold with tears how it was not her fault, for Chaval had kept her,\r\nthreatening to beat her if she ran away. He was becoming mad with\r\njealousy, and wished to prevent her from returning to \xc3\x89tienne\'s bed,\r\nwhere he well knew, he said, that the family made her sleep. Maheude\r\nwas furious, and, after forbidding her daughter ever to see such a\r\nbrute again, talked of going to Montsou to box his ears. But, all the\r\nsame, it was a day lost, and the girl, now that she had this lover,\r\npreferred not to change him.\r\n\r\nTwo days after there was another incident. On Monday and Tuesday\r\nJeanlin, who was supposed to be quietly engaged on his task at the\r\nVoreux, had escaped, to run away into the marshes and the forest of\r\nVandame with B\xc3\xa9bert and Lydie. He had seduced them; no one knew to what\r\nplunder or to what games of precocious children they had all three\r\ngiven themselves up. He received a vigorous punishment, a whipping\r\nwhich his mother applied to him on the pavement outside before the\r\nterrified children of the settlement. Who could have thought such a\r\nthing of children belonging to her, who had cost so much since their\r\nbirth, and who ought now to be bringing something in? And in this cry\r\nthere was the remembrance of her own hard youth, of the hereditary\r\nmisery which made of each little one in the brood a bread-winner later\r\non.\r\n\r\nThat morning, when the men and the girl set out for the pit, Maheude\r\nsat up in her bed to say to Jeanlin:\r\n\r\n"You know that if you begin that game again, you little beast, I\'ll\r\ntake the skin off your bottom!"\r\n\r\nIn Maheu\'s new stall the work was hard. This part of the Filonni\xc3\xa9re\r\nseam was so thin that the pikemen, squeezed between the wall and the\r\nroof, grazed their elbows at their work. It was, too, becoming very\r\ndamp; from hour to hour they feared a rush of water, one of those\r\nsudden torrents which burst through rocks and carry away men. The day\r\nbefore, as \xc3\x89tienne was violently driving in his pick and drawing it\r\nout, he had received a jet of water in his face; but this was only an\r\nalarm; the cutting simply became damper and more unwholesome. Besides,\r\nhe now thought nothing of possible accidents; he forgot himself there\r\nwith his mates, careless of peril. They lived in fire-damp without even\r\nfeeling its weight on their eyelids, the spider\'s-web veil which it\r\nleft on the eyelashes. Sometimes when the flame of the lamps grew paler\r\nand bluer than usual it attracted attention, and a miner would put his\r\nhead against the seam to listen to the low noise of the gas, a noise\r\nof air-bubbles escaping from each crack. But the constant threat was\r\nof landslips; for, besides the insufficiency of the timbering, always\r\npatched up too quickly, the soil, soaked with water, would not hold.\r\n\r\nThree times during the day Maheu had been obliged to add to the\r\nplanking. It was half-past two, and the men would soon have to ascend.\r\nLying on his side, \xc3\x89tienne was finishing the cutting of a block, when a\r\ndistant growl of thunder shook the whole mine.\r\n\r\n"What\'s that, then?" he cried, putting down his axe to listen.\r\n\r\nHe had at first thought that the gallery was falling in behind his back.\r\n\r\nBut Maheu had already glided along the slope of the cutting, saying:\r\n\r\n"It\'s a fall! Quick, quick!"\r\n\r\nAll tumbled down and hastened, carried away by an impulse of anxious\r\nfraternity. Their lamps danced at their wrists in the deathly silence\r\nwhich had fallen; they rushed in single file along the passages with\r\nbent backs, as though they were galloping on all fours; and without\r\nslowing this gallop they asked each other questions and threw brief\r\nreplies. Where was it, then? In the cuttings, perhaps. No, it came from\r\nbelow; no, from the haulage. When they arrived at the chimney passage,\r\nthey threw themselves into it, tumbling one over the other without\r\ntroubling about bruises.\r\n\r\nJeanlin, with skin still red from the whipping of the day before, had\r\nnot run away from the pit on this day. He was trotting with naked\r\nfeet behind his tram, closing the ventilation doors one by one; when\r\nhe was not afraid of meeting a captain he jumped on to the last tram,\r\nwhich he was not allowed to do for fear he should go to sleep. But\r\nhis great amusement was, whenever the tram was shunted to let another\r\none pass, to go and join B\xc3\xa9bert, who was holding the reins in front.\r\nHe would come up slyly without his lamp and vigorously pinch his\r\ncompanion, inventing mischievous monkey tricks, with his yellow hair,\r\nhis large ears, his lean muzzle, lit up by little green eyes shining\r\nin the darkness. With morbid precocity, he seemed to have the obscure\r\nintelligence and the quick skill of a human abortion which had returned\r\nto its animal ways.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon, Mouque brought Bataille, whose turn it was, to the\r\ntrammers; and as the horse was snuffing in the shunting, Jeanlin, who\r\nhad glided up to B\xc3\xa9bert, asked him:\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter with the old hack to stop short like that? He\'ll\r\nbreak my legs."\r\n\r\nB\xc3\xa9bert could not reply; he had to hold in Bataille, who was growing\r\nlively at the approach of the other tram. The horse had smelled from\r\nafar his comrade, Trompette, for whom he had felt great tenderness ever\r\nsince the day when he had seen him disembarked in the pit. One might\r\nsay that it was the affectionate pity of an old philosopher anxious\r\nto console a young friend by imparting to him his own resignation and\r\npatience; for Trompette did not become reconciled, drawing his trams\r\nwithout any taste for the work, standing with lowered head blinded\r\nby the darkness, and for ever regretting the sun. So every time that\r\nBataille met him he put out his head snorting, and moistened him with\r\nan encouraging caress.\r\n\r\n"By God!" swore B\xc3\xa9bert, "there they are, licking each other\'s skins\r\nagain!"\r\n\r\nThen, when Trompette had passed, he replied, on the subject of Bataille:\r\n\r\n"Oh, he\'s a cunning old beast! When he stops like that it\'s because he\r\nguesses there\'s something in the way, a stone or a hole, and he takes\r\ncare of himself; he doesn\'t want to break his bones. To-day I don\'t\r\nknow what was the matter with him down there after the door. He pushed\r\nit, and stood stock-still. Did you see anything?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Jeanlin. "There\'s water, I\'ve got it up to my knees."\r\n\r\nThe tram set out again. And, on the following journey, when he had\r\nopened the ventilation door with a blow from his head, Bataille again\r\nrefused to advance, neighing and trembling. At last he made up his\r\nmind, and set off with a bound.\r\n\r\nJeanlin, who closed the door, had remained behind. He bent down and\r\nlooked at the mud through which he was paddling, then, raising his\r\nlamp, he saw that the wood had given way beneath the continual bleeding\r\nof a spring. Just then a pikeman, one Berloque, who was called Chicot,\r\nhad arrived from his cutting, in a hurry to go to his wife who had just\r\nbeen confined. He also stopped and examined the planking. And suddenly,\r\nas the boy was starting to rejoin his train, a tremendous cracking\r\nsound was heard, and a landslip engulfed the man and the child.\r\n\r\nThere was deep silence. A thick dust raised by the wind of the fall\r\npassed through the passages. Blinded and choked, the miners came from\r\nevery part, even from the farthest stalls, with their dancing lamps\r\nwhich feebly lighted up this gallop of black men at the bottom of\r\nthese molehills. When the first men tumbled against the landslip,\r\nthey shouted out and called their mates. A second band, come from the\r\ncutting below, found themselves on the other side of the mass of earth\r\nwhich stopped up the gallery. It was at once seen that the roof had\r\nfallen in for a dozen metres at most. The damage was not serious. But\r\nall hearts were contracted when a death-rattle was heard from the ruins.\r\n\r\nB\xc3\xa9bert, leaving his tram, ran up, repeating:\r\n\r\n"Jeanlin is underneath! Jeanlin is underneath!"\r\n\r\nMaheu, at this very moment, had come out of the passage with Zacharie\r\nand \xc3\x89tienne. He was seized with the fury of despair, and could only\r\nutter oaths:\r\n\r\n"My God! my God! my God!"\r\n\r\nCatherine, Lydie, and Mouquette, who had also rushed up, began to sob\r\nand shriek with terror in the midst of the fearful disorder, which was\r\nincreased by the darkness. The men tried to make them be silent, but\r\nthey shrieked louder as each groan was heard.\r\n\r\nThe captain, Richomme, had come up running, in despair that neither\r\nN\xc3\xa9grel, the engineer, nor Dansaert was at the pit. With his ear pressed\r\nagainst the rocks he listened; and, at last, said those sounds could\r\nnot come from a child. A man must certainly be there. Maheu had already\r\ncalled Jeanlin twenty times over. Not a breath was heard. The little\r\none must have been smashed up.\r\n\r\nAnd still the groans continued monotonously. They spoke to the agonized\r\nman, asking him his name. The groaning alone replied.\r\n\r\n"Look sharp!" repeated Richomme, who had already organized a rescue,\r\n"we can talk afterwards."\r\n\r\nFrom each end the miners attacked the landslip with pick and shovel.\r\nChaval worked without a word beside Maheu and \xc3\x89tienne, while Zacharie\r\nsuperintended the removal of the earth. The hour for ascent had come,\r\nand no one had touched food; but they could not go up for their soup\r\nwhile their mates were in peril. They realized, however, that the\r\nsettlement would be disturbed if no one came back, and it was proposed\r\nto send off the women. But neither Catherine nor Mouquette, nor even\r\nLydie, would move, nailed to the spot with a desire to know what\r\nhad happened, and to help. Levaque then accepted the commission of\r\nannouncing the landslip up above--a simple accident, which was being\r\nrepaired. It was nearly four o\'clock; in less than an hour the men had\r\ndone a day\'s work; half the earth would have already been removed if\r\nmore rocks had not slid from the roof. Maheu persisted with such energy\r\nthat he refused, with a furious gesture, when another man approached to\r\nrelieve him for a moment.\r\n\r\n"Gently!" said Richomme at last, "we are getting near. We must not\r\nfinish them off."\r\n\r\nIn fact the groaning was becoming more and more distinct. It was a\r\ncontinuous rattling which guided the workers; and now it seemed to be\r\nbeneath their very picks. Suddenly it stopped.\r\n\r\nIn silence they all looked at one another, and shuddered as they felt\r\nthe coldness of death pass in the darkness. They dug on, soaked in\r\nsweat, their muscles tense to breaking. They came upon a foot, and then\r\nbegan to remove the earth with their hands, freeing the limbs one by\r\none. The head was not hurt. They turned their lamps on it, and Chicot\'s\r\nname went round. He was quite warm, with his spinal column broken by a\r\nrock.\r\n\r\n"Wrap him up in a covering, and put him in a tram," ordered the\r\ncaptain. "Now for the lad; look sharp."\r\n\r\nMaheu gave a last blow, and an opening was made, communicating with\r\nthe men who were clearing away the soil from the other side. They\r\nshouted out that they had just found Jeanlin, unconscious, with both\r\nlegs broken, still breathing. It was the father who took up the little\r\none in his arms, with clenched jaws constantly uttering "My God!" to\r\nexpress his grief, while Catherine and the other women again began to\r\nshriek.\r\n\r\nA procession was quickly formed. B\xc3\xa9bert had brought back Bataille,\r\nwho was harnessed to the trams. In the first lay Chicot\'s corpse,\r\nsupported by \xc3\x89tienne; in the second, Maheu was seated with Jeanlin,\r\nstill unconscious, on his knees, covered by a strip of wool torn from\r\nthe ventilation door. They started at a walking pace. On each tram was\r\na lamp like a red star. Then behind followed the row of miners, some\r\nfifty shadows in single file. Now that they were overcome by fatigue,\r\nthey trailed their feet, slipping in the mud, with the mournful\r\nmelancholy of a flock stricken by an epidemic. It took them nearly half\r\nan hour to reach the pit-eye. This procession beneath the earth, in the\r\nmidst of deep darkness, seemed never to end through galleries which\r\nbifurcated and turned and unrolled.\r\n\r\nAt the pit-eye Richomme, who had gone on before, had ordered an empty\r\ncage to be reserved. Pierron immediately loaded the two trams. In the\r\nfirst Maheu remained with his wounded little one on his knees, while in\r\nthe other \xc3\x89tienne kept Chicot\'s corpse between his arms to hold it up.\r\nWhen the men had piled themselves up in the other decks the cage rose.\r\nIt took two minutes. The rain from the tubbing fell very cold, and the\r\nmen looked up towards the air impatient to see daylight.\r\n\r\nFortunately a trammer sent to Dr. Vanderhaghen\'s had found him and\r\nbrought him back. Jeanlin and the dead man were placed in the captains\'\r\nroom, where, from year\'s end to year\'s end, a large fire burnt. A\r\nrow of buckets with warm water was ready for washing feet; and, two\r\nmattresses having been spread on the floor, the man and the child were\r\nplaced on them. Maheu and \xc3\x89tienne alone entered. Outside, putters,\r\nminers, and boys were running about, forming groups and talking in a\r\nlow voice.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the doctor had glanced at Chicot:\r\n\r\n"Done for! You can wash him."\r\n\r\nTwo overseers undressed and then washed with a sponge this corpse\r\nblackened with coal and still dirty with the sweat of work.\r\n\r\n"Nothing wrong with the head," said the doctor again, kneeling on\r\nJeanlin\'s mattress. "Nor the chest either. Ah! it\'s the legs which have\r\ngiven."\r\n\r\nHe himself undressed the child, unfastening the cap, taking off the\r\njacket, drawing off the breeches and shirt with the skill of a nurse.\r\nAnd the poor little body appeared, as lean as an insect, stained with\r\nblack dust and yellow earth, marbled by bloody patches. Nothing could\r\nbe made out, and they had to wash him also. He seemed to grow leaner\r\nbeneath the sponge, the flesh so pallid and transparent that one could\r\nsee the bones. It was a pity to look on this last degeneration of a\r\nwretched race, this mere nothing that was suffering and half crushed by\r\nthe falling of the rocks. When he was clean they perceived the bruises\r\non the thighs, two red patches on the white skin.\r\n\r\nJeanlin, awaking from his faint, moaned. Standing up at the foot of the\r\nmattress with hands hanging down, Maheu was looking at him and large\r\ntears rolled from his eyes.\r\n\r\n"Eh, are you the father?" said the doctor, raising his eyes; "no need\r\nto cry then, you can see he is not dead. Help me instead."\r\n\r\nHe found two simple fractures. But the right leg gave him some anxiety,\r\nit would probably have to be cut off.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the engineer, N\xc3\xa9grel, and Dansaert, who had been\r\ninformed, came up with Richomme. The first listened to the captain\'s\r\nnarrative with an exasperated air. He broke out: Always this cursed\r\ntimbering! Had he not repeated a hundred times that they would leave\r\ntheir men down there! and those brutes who talked about going out on\r\nstrike if they were forced to timber more solidly. The worst was that\r\nnow the Company would have to pay for the broken pots. M. Hennebeau\r\nwould be pleased!\r\n\r\n"Who is it?" he asked of Dansaert, who was standing in silence before\r\nthe corpse which was being wrapped up in a sheet.\r\n\r\n"Chicot! one of our good workers," replied the chief captain. "He has\r\nthree children. Poor chap!"\r\n\r\nDr. Vanderhaghen ordered Jeanlin\'s immediate removal to his parents\'.\r\nSix o\'clock struck, twilight was already coming on, and they would do\r\nwell to remove the corpse also; the engineer gave orders to harness\r\nthe van and to bring a stretcher. The wounded child was placed on the\r\nstretcher while the mattress and the dead body were put into the van.\r\n\r\nSome putters were still standing at the door talking with some miners\r\nwho were waiting about to look on. When the door reopened there was\r\nsilence in the group. A new procession was then formed, the van in\r\nfront, then the stretcher, and then the train of people. They left the\r\nmine square and went slowly up the road to the settlement. The first\r\nNovember cold had denuded the immense plain; the night was now slowly\r\nburying it like a shroud fallen from the livid sky.\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne then in a low voice advised Maheu to send Catherine on to warn\r\nMaheude so as to soften the blow. The overwhelmed father, who was\r\nfollowing the stretcher, agreed with a nod; and the young girl set out\r\nrunning, for they were now near. But the van, that gloomy well-known\r\nbox, was already signalled. Women ran out wildly on to the paths; three\r\nor four rushed about in anguish, without their bonnets. Soon there were\r\nthirty of them, then fifty, all choking with the same terror. Then\r\nsomeone was dead? Who was it? The story told by Levaque after first\r\nreassuring them, now exaggerated their nightmare: it was not one man,\r\nit was ten who had perished, and who were now being brought back in the\r\nvan one by one.\r\n\r\nCatherine found her mother agitated by a presentiment; and after\r\nhearing the first stammered words Maheude cried:\r\n\r\n"The father\'s dead!"\r\n\r\nThe young girl protested in vain, speaking of Jeanlin. Without hearing\r\nher, Maheude had rushed forward. And on seeing the van, which was\r\npassing before the church, she grew faint and pale. The women at their\r\ndoors, mute with terror, were stretching out their necks, while others\r\nfollowed, trembling as they wondered before whose house the procession\r\nwould stop.\r\n\r\nThe vehicle passed; and behind it Maheude saw Maheu, who was\r\naccompanying the stretcher. Then, when they had placed the stretcher\r\nat her door and when she saw Jeanlin alive with his legs broken, there\r\nwas so sudden a reaction in her that she choked with anger, stammering,\r\nwithout tears:\r\n\r\n"Is this it? They cripple our little ones now! Both legs! My God! What\r\ndo they want me to do with him?"\r\n\r\n"Be still, then," said Dr. Vanderhaghen, who had followed to attend to\r\nJeanlin. "Would you rather he had remained below?"\r\n\r\nBut Maheude grew more furious, while Alzire, L\xc3\xa9nore, and Henri were\r\ncrying around her. As she helped to carry up the wounded boy and to\r\ngive the doctor what he needed, she cursed fate, and asked where she\r\nwas to find money to feed invalids. The old man was not then enough,\r\nnow this rascal too had lost his legs! And she never ceased; while\r\nother cries, more heart-breaking lamentations, were heard from a\r\nneighbouring house: Chicot\'s wife and children were weeping over the\r\nbody. It was now quite night, the exhausted miners were at last eating\r\ntheir soup, and the settlement had fallen into a melancholy silence,\r\nonly disturbed by these loud outcries.\r\n\r\nThree weeks passed. It was found possible to avoid amputation; Jeanlin\r\nkept both his legs, but he remained lame. On investigation the Company\r\nhad resigned itself to giving a donation of fifty francs. It had also\r\npromised to find employment for the little cripple at the surface as\r\nsoon as he was well. All the same their misery was aggravated, for the\r\nfather had received such a shock that he was seriously ill with fever.\r\n\r\nSince Thursday Maheu had been back at the pit and it was now Sunday.\r\nIn the evening \xc3\x89tienne talked of the approaching date of the 1st\r\nof December, preoccupied in wondering if the Company would execute\r\nits threat. They sat up till ten o\'clock waiting for Catherine, who\r\nmust have been delaying with Chaval. But she did not return. Maheude\r\nfuriously bolted the door without a word. \xc3\x89tienne was long in going\r\nto sleep, restless at the thought of that empty bed in which Alzire\r\noccupied so little room.\r\n\r\nNext morning she was still absent; and it was only in the afternoon, on\r\nreturning from the pit, that the Maheus learnt that Chaval was keeping\r\nCatherine. He created such abominable scenes with her that she had\r\ndecided to stay with him. To avoid reproaches he had suddenly left the\r\nVoreux and had been taken on at Jean-Bart, M. Deneulin\'s mine, and she\r\nhad followed him as a putter. The new household still lived at Montsou,\r\nat Piquette\'s.\r\n\r\nMaheu at first talked of going to fight the man and of bringing his\r\ndaughter back with a kick in the backside. Then he made a gesture of\r\nresignation: what was the good? It always turned out like that; one\r\ncould not prevent a girl from sticking to a man when she wanted to. It\r\nwas much better to wait quietly for the marriage. But Maheude did not\r\ntake things so easily.\r\n\r\n"Did I beat her when she took this Chaval?" she cried to \xc3\x89tienne, who\r\nlistened in silence, very pale. "See now, tell me! you, who are a\r\nsensible man. We have left her free, haven\'t we? because, my God! they\r\nall come to it. Now, I was in the family way when the father married\r\nme. But I didn\'t run away from my parents, and I should never have done\r\nso dirty a trick as to carry the money I earned to a man who had no\r\nwant of it before the proper age. Ah! it\'s disgusting, you know. People\r\nwill leave off getting children!"\r\n\r\nAnd as \xc3\x89tienne still replied only by nodding his head, she insisted:\r\n\r\n"A girl who went out every evening where she wanted to! What has she\r\ngot in her skin, then, not to be able to wait till I married her after\r\nshe had helped to get us out of difficulties? Eh? it\'s natural, one\r\nhas a daughter to work. But there! we have been too good, we ought not\r\nto let her go and amuse herself with a man. Give them an inch and they\r\ntake an ell."\r\n\r\nAlzire nodded approvingly. L\xc3\xa9nore and Henri, overcome by this storm,\r\ncried quietly, while the mother now enumerated their misfortunes: first\r\nZacharie who had had to get married; then old Bonnemort who was there\r\non his chair with his twisted feet; then Jeanlin who could not leave\r\nthe room for ten days with his badly-united bones; and now, as a last\r\nblow, this jade Catherine, who had gone away with a man! The whole\r\nfamily was breaking up. There was only the father left at the pit. How\r\nwere they to live, seven persons without counting Estelle, on his three\r\nfrancs? They might as well jump into the canal in a band.\r\n\r\n"It won\'t do any good to worry yourself," said Maheu in a low voice,\r\n"perhaps we have not got to the end."\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne, who was looking fixedly at the flags on the floor, raised his\r\nhead, and murmured with eyes lost in a vision of the future:\r\n\r\n"Ah! it is time! it is time!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART FOUR\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\n\r\nOn that Monday the Hennebeaus had invited the Gr\xc3\xa9goires and their\r\ndaughter C\xc3\xa9cile to lunch. They had formed their plans: on rising from\r\ntable, Paul N\xc3\xa9grel was to take the ladies to a mine, Saint-Thomas,\r\nwhich had been luxuriously reinstalled. But this was only an amiable\r\npretext; this party was an invention of Madame Hennebeau\'s to hasten\r\nthe marriage of C\xc3\xa9cile and Paul.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, on this very Monday, at four o\'clock in the morning, the\r\nstrike broke out. When, on the 1st of December, the Company had\r\nadopted the new wage system, the miners remained calm. At the end of\r\nthe fortnight not one made the least protest on pay-day. Everybody,\r\nfrom the manager down to the last overseer, considered the tariff\r\nas accepted; and great was their surprise in the morning at this\r\ndeclaration of war, made with a tactical unity which seemed to indicate\r\nenergetic leadership.\r\n\r\nAt five o\'clock Dansaert woke M. Hennebeau to inform him that not\r\na single man had gone down at the Voreux. The settlement of the\r\nDeux-Cent-Quarante, which he had passed through, was sleeping deeply,\r\nwith closed windows and doors. And as soon as the manager had jumped\r\nout of bed, his eyes still swollen with sleep, he was overwhelmed.\r\nEvery quarter of an hour messengers came in, and dispatches fell on his\r\ndesk as thick as hail. At first he hoped that the revolt was limited\r\nto the Voreux; but the news became more serious every minute. There\r\nwas the Mirou, the Cr\xc3\xa9vecoeur, the Madeleine, where only the grooms\r\nhad appeared; the Victoire and Feutry-Cantel, the two best disciplined\r\npits, where the men had been reduced by a third; Saint-Thomas alone\r\nnumbered all its people, and seemed to be outside the movement. Up to\r\nnine o\'clock he dictated dispatches, telegraphing in all directions,\r\nto the prefect of Lille, to the directors of the Company, warning the\r\nauthorities and asking for orders. He had sent N\xc3\xa9grel to go round the\r\nneighbouring pits to obtain precise information.\r\n\r\nSuddenly M. Hennebeau recollected the lunch; and he was about to send\r\nthe coachman to tell the Gr\xc3\xa9goires that the party had been put off,\r\nwhen a certain hesitation and lack of will stopped him--the man who in\r\na few brief phrases had just made military preparations for a field of\r\nbattle. He went up to Madame Hennebeau, whose hair had just been done\r\nby her lady\'s maid, in her dressing-room.\r\n\r\n"Ah! they are on strike," she said quietly, when he had told her.\r\n"Well, what has that to do with us? We are not going to leave off\r\neating, I suppose?"\r\n\r\nAnd she was obstinate; it was vain to tell her that the lunch would be\r\ndisturbed, and that the visit to Saint-Thomas could not take place.\r\nShe found an answer to everything. Why lose a lunch that was already\r\ncooking? And as to visiting the pit, they could give that up afterwards\r\nif the walk was really imprudent.\r\n\r\n"Besides," she added, when the maid had gone out, "you know that I am\r\nanxious to receive these good people. This marriage ought to affect you\r\nmore than the follies of your men. I want to have it, don\'t contradict\r\nme."\r\n\r\nHe looked at her, agitated by a slight trembling, and the hard firm\r\nface of the man of discipline expressed the secret grief of a wounded\r\nheart. She had remained with naked shoulders, already over-mature, but\r\nstill imposing and desirable, with the broad bust of a Ceres gilded by\r\nthe autumn. For a moment he felt a brutal desire to seize her, and to\r\nroll his head between the breasts she was exposing in this warm room,\r\nwhich exhibited the private luxury of a sensual woman and had about it\r\nan irritating perfume of musk, but he recoiled; for ten years they had\r\noccupied separate rooms.\r\n\r\n"Good!" he said, leaving her. "Do not make any alterations."\r\n\r\nM. Hennebeau had been born in the Ardennes. In his early life he had\r\nundergone the hardships of a poor boy thrown as an orphan on the Paris\r\nstreets. After having painfully followed the courses of the \xc3\x89cole\r\ndes Mines, at the age of twenty-four he had gone to the Grand\' Combe\r\nas engineer to the Sainte-Barbe mine. Three years later he became\r\ndivisional engineer in the Pas-de-Calais, at the Marles mines. It was\r\nthere that he married, wedding, by one of those strokes of fortune\r\nwhich are the rule among the Corps des Mines, the daughter of the rich\r\nowner of a spinning factory at Arras. For fifteen years they lived in\r\nthe same small provincial town, and no event broke the monotony of\r\nexistence, not even the birth of a child. An increasing irritation\r\ndetached Madame Hennebeau, who had been brought up to respect money,\r\nand was disdainful of this husband who gained a small salary with such\r\ndifficulty, and who enabled her to gratify none of the satisfactions\r\nof vanity which she had dreamed of at school. He was a man of strict\r\nhonesty, who never speculated, but stood at his post like a soldier.\r\nThe lack of harmony had only increased, aggravated by one of those\r\ncurious misunderstandings of the flesh which freeze the most ardent;\r\nhe adored his wife, she had the sensuality of a greedy blonde, and\r\nalready they slept apart, ill at ease and wounded. From that time she\r\nhad a lover of whom he was ignorant. At last he left the Pas-de-Calais\r\nto occupy a situation in an office at Paris, with the idea that she\r\nwould be grateful to him. But Paris only completed their separation,\r\nthat Paris which she had desired since her first doll, and where she\r\nwashed away her provincialism in a week, becoming a woman of fashion\r\nat once, and throwing herself into all the luxurious follies of the\r\nperiod. The ten years which she spent there were filled by a great\r\npassion, a public intrigue with a man whose desertion nearly killed\r\nher. This time the husband had not been able to keep his ignorance, and\r\nafter some abominable scenes he resigned himself, disarmed by the quiet\r\nunconsciousness of this woman who took her happiness where she found\r\nit. It was after the rupture, and when he saw that she was ill with\r\ngrief, that he had accepted the management of the Montsou mines, still\r\nhoping also that she would reform down there in that desolate black\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe Hennebeaus, since they had lived at Montsou, returned to the\r\nirritated boredom of their early married days. At first she seemed\r\nconsoled by the great quiet, soothed by the flat monotony of the\r\nimmense plain; she buried herself in it as a woman who has done with\r\nthe world; she affected a dead heart, so detached from life that she\r\ndid not even mind growing stout. Then, beneath this indifference a\r\nfinal fever declared itself, the need to live once more, and she\r\ndeluded herself for six months by organizing and furnishing to her\r\ntaste the little villa belonging to the management. She said it was\r\nfrightful, and filled it with upholstery, bric-a-brac, and all sorts of\r\nartistic luxuries which were talked of as far as Lille. Now the country\r\nexasperated her, those stupid fields spread out to infinity, those\r\neternal black roads without a tree, swarming with a horrid population\r\nwhich disgusted and frightened her. Complaints of exile began; she\r\naccused her husband of having sacrificed her to a salary of forty\r\nthousand francs, a trifle which hardly sufficed to keep the house up.\r\nWhy could he not imitate others, demand a part for himself, obtain\r\nshares, succeed in something at last? And she insisted with the cruelty\r\nof an heiress who had brought her own fortune. He, always restrained,\r\nand taking refuge in the deceptive coldness of a man of business, was\r\ntorn by desire for this creature, one of those late desires which are\r\nso violent and which increase with age. He had never possessed her as a\r\nlover; he was haunted by a continual image, to have her once to himself\r\nas she had given herself to another. Every morning he dreamed of\r\nwinning her in the evening; then, when she looked at him with her cold\r\neyes, and when he felt that everything within her denied itself to him,\r\nhe even avoided touching her hand. It was a suffering without possible\r\ncure, hidden beneath the stiffness of his attitude, the suffering of a\r\ntender nature in secret anguish at the lack of domestic happiness. At\r\nthe end of six months, when the house, being definitely furnished, no\r\nlonger occupied Madame Hennebeau, she fell into the languor of boredom,\r\na victim who was being killed by exile, and who said that she was glad\r\nto die of it.\r\n\r\nJust then Paul N\xc3\xa9grel arrived at Montsou. His mother, the widow of\r\na Provence captain, living at Avignon on a slender income, had had\r\nto content herself with bread and water to enable him to reach the\r\n\xc3\x89cole Polytechnique. He had come out low in rank, and his uncle, M.\r\nHennebeau, had enabled him to leave by offering to take him as engineer\r\nat the Voreux. From that time he was treated as one of the family; he\r\neven had his room there, his meals there, lived there, and was thus\r\nenabled to send to his mother half his salary of three thousand francs.\r\nTo disguise this kindness M. Hennebeau spoke of the embarrassment to\r\na young man of setting up a household in one of those little villas\r\nreserved for the mine engineers. Madame Hennebeau had at once taken the\r\npart of a good aunt, treating her nephew with familiarity and watching\r\nover his comfort. During the first months, especially, she exhibited\r\nan overwhelming maternity with her advice regarding the smallest\r\nsubjects. But she remained a woman, however, and slid into personal\r\nconfidences. This lad, so young and so practical, with his unscrupulous\r\nintelligence, professing a philosopher\'s theory of love, amused her\r\nwith the vivacity of the pessimism which had sharpened his thin face\r\nand pointed nose. One evening he naturally found himself in her arms,\r\nand she seemed to give herself up out of kindness, while saying to\r\nhim that she had no heart left, and wished only to be his friend. In\r\nfact, she was not jealous; she joked him about the putters, whom he\r\ndeclared to be abominable, and she almost sulked because he had no\r\nyoung man\'s pranks to narrate to her. Then she was carried away by the\r\nidea of getting him married; she dreamed of sacrificing herself and of\r\nfinding a rich girl for him. Their relations continued a plaything, a\r\nrecreation, in which she felt the last tenderness of a lazy woman who\r\nhad done with the world.\r\n\r\nTwo years had passed by. One night M. Hennebeau had a suspicion when\r\nhe heard naked feet passing his door. But this new adventure revolted\r\nhim, in his own house, between this mother and this son! And besides,\r\non the following day his wife spoke to him about the choice of C\xc3\xa9cile\r\nGr\xc3\xa9goire which she had made for her nephew. She occupied herself over\r\nthis marriage with such ardour that he blushed at his own monstrous\r\nimagination. He only felt gratitude towards the young man who, since\r\nhis arrival, had made the house less melancholy.\r\n\r\nAs he came down from the dressing-room, M. Hennebeau found that Paul,\r\nwho had just returned, was in the vestibule. He seemed to be quite\r\namused by the story of this strike.\r\n\r\n"Well?" asked his uncle.\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'ve been round the settlements. They seem to be quite sensible\r\nin there. I think they will first send you a deputation."\r\n\r\nBut at that moment Madame Hennebeau\'s voice called from the first story:\r\n\r\n"Is that you, Paul? Come up, then, and tell me the news. How queer they\r\nare to make such a fuss, these people who are so happy!"\r\n\r\nAnd the manager had to renounce further information, since his wife had\r\ntaken his messenger. He returned and sat before his desk, on which a\r\nnew packet of dispatches was placed.\r\n\r\nAt eleven o\'clock the Gr\xc3\xa9goires arrived, and were astonished when\r\nHippolyte, the footman, who was placed as sentinel, hustled them in\r\nafter an anxious glance at the two ends of the road. The drawing-room\r\ncurtains were drawn, and they were taken at once into the study, where\r\nM. Hennebeau apologized for their reception; but the drawing-room\r\nlooked over the street and it was undesirable to seem to offer\r\nprovocations.\r\n\r\n"What! you don\'t know?" he went on, seeing their surprise.\r\n\r\nM. Gr\xc3\xa9goire, when he heard that the strike had at last broken out,\r\nshrugged his shoulders in his placid way. Bah! it would be nothing,\r\nthe people were honest. With a movement of her chin, Madame Gr\xc3\xa9goire\r\napproved his confidence in the everlasting resignation of the colliers;\r\nwhile C\xc3\xa9cile, who was very cheerful that day, feeling that she looked\r\nwell in her capuchin cloth costume, smiled at the word "strike," which\r\nreminded her of visits to the settlements and the distribution of\r\ncharities.\r\n\r\nMadame Hennebeau now appeared in black silk, followed by N\xc3\xa9grel.\r\n\r\n"Ah! isn\'t it annoying!" she said, at the door. "As if they couldn\'t\r\nwait, those men! You know that Paul refuses to take us to Saint-Thomas."\r\n\r\n"We can stay here," said M. Gr\xc3\xa9goire, obligingly. "We shall be quite\r\npleased."\r\n\r\nPaul had contented himself with formally saluting C\xc3\xa9cile and her\r\nmother. Angry at this lack of demonstrativeness, his aunt sent him with\r\na look to the young girl; and when she heard them laughing together she\r\nenveloped them in a maternal glance.\r\n\r\nM. Hennebeau, however, finished reading his dispatches and prepared a\r\nfew replies. They talked near him; his wife explained that she had not\r\ndone anything to this study, which, in fact, retained its faded old red\r\npaper, its heavy mahogany furniture, its cardboard files, scratched\r\nby use. Three-quarters of an hour passed and they were about to seat\r\nthemselves at table when the footman announced M. Deneulin. He entered\r\nin an excited way and bowed to Madame Hennebeau.\r\n\r\n"Ah! you here!" he said, seeing the Gr\xc3\xa9goires.\r\n\r\nAnd he quickly spoke to the manager:\r\n\r\n"It has come, then? I\'ve just heard of it through my engineer. With me,\r\nall the men went down this morning. But the thing may spread. I\'m not\r\nat all at ease. How is it with you?"\r\n\r\nHe had arrived on horseback, and his anxiety betrayed itself in his\r\nloud speech and abrupt gestures, which made him resemble a retired\r\ncavalry officer.\r\n\r\nM. Hennebeau was beginning to inform him regarding the precise\r\nsituation, when Hippolyte opened the dining-room door. Then he\r\ninterrupted himself to say:\r\n\r\n"Lunch with us. I will tell you more at dessert."\r\n\r\n"Yes, as you please," replied Deneulin, so full of his thoughts that he\r\naccepted without ceremony.\r\n\r\nHe was, however, conscious of his impoliteness and turned towards\r\nMadame Hennebeau with apologies. She was very charming, however. When\r\nshe had had a seventh plate laid she placed her guests: Madame Gr\xc3\xa9goire\r\nand C\xc3\xa9cile by her husband, then M. Gr\xc3\xa9goire and Deneulin at her own\r\nright and left; then Paul, whom she put between the young girl and her\r\nfather. As they attacked the _hors-d\'oeuvre_ she said, with a\r\nsmile:\r\n\r\n"You must excuse me; I wanted to give you oysters. On Monday, you know,\r\nthere was an arrival of Ostend oysters at Marchiennes, and I meant to\r\nsend the cook with the carriage. But she was afraid of being stoned--"\r\n\r\nThey all interrupted her with a great burst of gaiety. They thought the\r\nstory very funny.\r\n\r\n"Hush!" said M. Hennebeau, vexed, looking at the window, through which\r\nthe road could be seen. "We need not tell the whole country that we\r\nhave company this morning."\r\n\r\n"Well, here is a slice of sausage which they shan\'t have," M. Gr\xc3\xa9goire\r\ndeclared.\r\n\r\nThe laughter began again, but with greater restraint. Each guest made\r\nhimself comfortable, in this room upholstered with Flemish tapestry\r\nand furnished with old oak chests. The silver shone behind the panes\r\nof the sideboards; and there was a large hanging lamp of red copper,\r\nwhose polished surfaces reflected a palm and an aspidistra growing\r\nin majolica pots. Outside, the December day was frozen by a keen\r\nnorth-east wind. But not a breath of it entered; a green-house warmth\r\ndeveloped the delicate odour of the pineapple, sliced in a crystal bowl.\r\n\r\n"Suppose we were to draw the curtains," proposed N\xc3\xa9grel, who was amused\r\nat the idea of frightening the Gr\xc3\xa9goires.\r\n\r\nThe housemaid, who was helping the footman, treated this as an order\r\nand went and closed one of the curtains. This led to interminable\r\njokes: not a glass or a plate could be put down without precaution;\r\nevery dish was hailed as a waif escaped from the pillage in a conquered\r\ntown; and behind this forced gaiety there was a certain fear which\r\nbetrayed itself in involuntary glances towards the road, as though a\r\nband of starvelings were watching the table from outside.\r\n\r\nAfter the scrambled eggs with truffles, trout came on. The conversation\r\nthen turned to the industrial crisis, which had become aggravated\r\nduring the last eighteen months.\r\n\r\n"It was inevitable," said Deneulin, "the excessive prosperity of recent\r\nyears was bound to bring us to it. Think of the enormous capital which\r\nhas been sunk, the railways, harbours, and canals, all the money buried\r\nin the maddest speculations. Among us alone sugar works have been set\r\nup as if the department could furnish three beetroot harvests. Good\r\nheavens! and to-day money is scarce, and we have to wait to catch up\r\nthe interest of the expended millions; so there is a mortal congestion\r\nand a final stagnation of business."\r\n\r\nM. Hennebeau disputed this theory, but he agreed that the fortunate\r\nyears had spoilt the men.\r\n\r\n"When I think," he exclaimed, "that these chaps in our pits used to\r\ngain six francs a day, double what they gain now! And they lived well,\r\ntoo, and acquired luxurious tastes. To-day, naturally, it seems hard to\r\nthem to go back to their old frugality."\r\n\r\n"Monsieur Gr\xc3\xa9goire," interrupted Madame Hennebeau, "let me persuade\r\nyou, a little more trout. They are delicious, are they not?"\r\n\r\nThe manager went on:\r\n\r\n"But, as a matter of fact, is it our fault? We, too, are cruelly\r\nstruck. Since the factories have closed, one by one, we have had a\r\ndeuce of a difficulty in getting rid of our stock; and in face of\r\nthe growing reduction in demand we have been forced to lower our net\r\nprices. It is just this that the men won\'t understand."\r\n\r\nThere was silence. The footman presented roast partridge, while the\r\nhousemaid began to pour out Chambertin for the guests.\r\n\r\n"There has been a famine in India," said Deneulin in a low voice, as\r\nthough he were speaking to himself. "America, by ceasing to order iron,\r\nhas struck a heavy blow at our furnaces. Everything holds together; a\r\ndistant shock is enough to disturb the world. And the empire, which was\r\nso proud of this hot fever of industry!"\r\n\r\nHe attacked his partridge wing. Then, raising his voice:\r\n\r\n"The worst is that to lower the net prices we ought logically to\r\nproduce more; otherwise the reduction bears on wages, and the worker is\r\nright in saying that he has to pay the damage."\r\n\r\nThis confession, the outcome of his frankness, raised a discussion.\r\nThe ladies were not at all interested. Besides, all were occupied with\r\ntheir plates, in the first zest of appetite. When the footman came\r\nback, he seemed about to speak, then he hesitated.\r\n\r\n"What is it?" asked M. Hennebeau. "If there are letters, give them to\r\nme. I am expecting replies."\r\n\r\n"No, sir. It is Monsieur Dansaert, who is in the hall. But he doesn\'t\r\nwish to disturb you."\r\n\r\nThe manager excused himself, and had the head captain brought in. The\r\nlatter stood upright, a few paces from the table, while all turned\r\nto look at him, huge, out of breath with the news he was bringing.\r\nThe settlements were quiet; only it had now been decided to send a\r\ndeputation. It would, perhaps, be there in a few minutes.\r\n\r\n"Very well; thank you," said M. Hennebeau. "I want a report morning and\r\nevening, you understand."\r\n\r\nAnd as soon as Dansaert had gone, they began to joke again, and\r\nhastened to attack the Russian salad, declaring that not a moment was\r\nto be lost if they wished to finish it. The mirth was unbounded when\r\nN\xc3\xa9grel, having asked the housemaid for bread, she replied, "Yes, sir,"\r\nin a voice as low and terrified as if she had behind her a troop ready\r\nfor murder and rape.\r\n\r\n"You may speak," said Madame Hennebeau complacently. "They are not here\r\nyet."\r\n\r\nThe manager, who now received a packet of letters and dispatches,\r\nwished to read one of his letters aloud. It was from Pierron, who,\r\nin respectful phrases, gave notice that he was obliged to go out on\r\nstrike with his comrades, in order to avoid ill-treatment; and he added\r\nthat he had not even been able to avoid taking part in the deputation,\r\nalthough he blamed that step.\r\n\r\n"So much for liberty of work!" exclaimed M. Hennebeau.\r\n\r\nThen they returned to the strike, and asked him his opinion.\r\n\r\n"Oh!" he replied, "we have had them before. It will be a week, or, at\r\nmost, a fortnight, of idleness, as it was last time. They will go and\r\nwallow in the public-houses, and then, when they are hungry, they will\r\ngo back to the pits."\r\n\r\nDeneulin shook his head:\r\n\r\n"I\'m not so satisfied; this time they appear to be better organized.\r\nHave they not a Provident Fund?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, scarcely three thousand francs. What do you think they can do\r\nwith that? I suspect a man called \xc3\x89tienne Lantier of being their\r\nleader. He is a good workman; it would vex me to have to give him his\r\ncertificate back, as we did of old to the famous Rasseneur, who still\r\npoisons the Voreux with his ideas and his beer. No matter, in a week\r\nhalf the men will have gone down, and in a fortnight the ten thousand\r\nwill be below."\r\n\r\nHe was convinced. His only anxiety was concerning his own possible\r\ndisgrace should the directors put the responsibility of the strike on\r\nhim. For some time he had felt that he was diminishing in favour. So\r\nleaving the spoonful of Russian salad which he had taken, he read over\r\nagain the dispatches received from Paris, endeavouring to penetrate\r\nevery word. His guests excused him; the meal was becoming a military\r\nlunch, eaten on the field of battle before the first shots were fired.\r\n\r\nThe ladies then joined in the conversation. Madame Gr\xc3\xa9goire expressed\r\npity for the poor people who would suffer from hunger; and C\xc3\xa9cile was\r\nalready making plans for distributing gifts of bread and meat. But\r\nMadame Hennebeau was astonished at hearing of the wretchedness of\r\nthe Montsou colliers. Were they not very fortunate? People who were\r\nlodged and warmed and cared for at the expense of the Company! In her\r\nindifference for the herd, she only knew the lessons she had learnt,\r\nand with which she had surprised the Parisians who came on a visit.\r\nShe believed them at last, and was indignant at the ingratitude of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nN\xc3\xa9grel, meanwhile, continued to frighten M. Gr\xc3\xa9goire. C\xc3\xa9cile did not\r\ndisplease him, and he was quite willing to marry her to be agreeable to\r\nhis aunt, but he showed no amorous fever; like a youth of experience,\r\nwho, he said, was not easily carried away now. He professed to be\r\na Republican, which did not prevent him from treating his men with\r\nextreme severity, or from making fun of them in the company of the\r\nladies.\r\n\r\n"Nor have I my uncle\'s optimism, either," he continued. "I fear\r\nthere will be serious disturbances. So I should advise you, Monsieur\r\nGr\xc3\xa9goire, to lock up Piolaine. They may pillage you."\r\n\r\nJust then, still retaining the smile which illuminated his good-natured\r\nface, M. Gr\xc3\xa9goire was going beyond his wife in paternal sentiments with\r\nregard to the miners.\r\n\r\n"Pillage me!" he cried, stupefied. "And why pillage me?"\r\n\r\n"Are you not a shareholder in Montsou! You do nothing; you live on the\r\nwork of others. In fact you are an infamous capitalist, and that is\r\nenough. You may be sure that if the revolution triumphs, it will force\r\nyou to restore your fortune as stolen money."\r\n\r\nAt once he lost his child-like tranquillity, his serene\r\nunconsciousness. He stammered:\r\n\r\n"Stolen money, my fortune! Did not my great-grandfather gain, and\r\nhardly, too, the sum originally invested? Have we not run all the risks\r\nof the enterprise, and do I today make a bad use of my income?"\r\n\r\nMadame Hennebeau, alarmed at seeing the mother and daughter also white\r\nwith fear, hastened to intervene, saying:\r\n\r\n"Paul is joking, my dear sir."\r\n\r\nBut M. Gr\xc3\xa9goire was carried out of himself. As the servant was passing\r\nround the crayfish he took three of them without knowing what he was\r\ndoing and began to break their claws with his teeth.\r\n\r\n"Ah! I don\'t say but what there are shareholders who abuse their\r\nposition. For instance, I have been told that ministers have received\r\nshares in Montsou for services rendered to the Company. It is like a\r\nnobleman whom I will not name, a duke, the biggest of our shareholders,\r\nwhose life is a scandal of prodigality, millions thrown into the street\r\non women, feasting, and useless luxury. But we who live quietly, like\r\ngood citizens as we are, who do not speculate, who are content to live\r\nwholesomely on what we have, giving a part to the poor: Come, now! your\r\nmen must be mere brigands if they came and stole a pin from us!"\r\n\r\nN\xc3\xa9grel himself had to calm him, though amused at his anger. The\r\ncrayfish were still going round; the little crackling sound of their\r\ncarapaces could be heard, while the conversation turned to politics,\r\nM. Gr\xc3\xa9goire, in spite of everything and though still trembling, called\r\nhimself a Liberal and regretted Louis Philippe. As for Deneulin, he was\r\nfor a strong Government; he declared that the Emperor was gliding down\r\nthe slope of dangerous concessions.\r\n\r\n"Remember \'89," he said. "It was the nobility who made the Revolution\r\npossible, by their complicity and taste for philosophic novelties. Very\r\nwell! the middle class to-day are playing the same silly game with\r\ntheir furious Liberalism, their rage for destruction, their flattery of\r\nthe people. Yes, yes, you are sharpening the teeth of the monster that\r\nwill devour us. It will devour us, rest assured!"\r\n\r\nThe ladies bade him be silent, and tried to change the conversation by\r\nasking him news of his daughters. Lucie was at Marchiennes, where she\r\nwas singing with a friend; Jeanne was painting an old beggar\'s head.\r\nBut he said these things in a distracted way; he constantly looked at\r\nthe manager, who was absorbed in the reading of his dispatches and\r\nforgetful of his guests. Behind those thin leaves he felt Paris and the\r\ndirectors\' orders, which would decide the strike. At last he could not\r\nhelp yielding to his preoccupation.\r\n\r\n"Well, what are you going to do?" he asked suddenly.\r\n\r\nM. Hennebeau started; then turned off the question with a vague phrase.\r\n\r\n"We shall see."\r\n\r\n"No doubt you are solidly placed, you can wait," Deneulin began to\r\nthink aloud. "But as for me, I shall be done for if the strike reaches\r\nVandame. I shall have reinstalled Jean-Bart in vain; with a single pit,\r\nI can only get along by constant production. Ah! I am not in a very\r\npleasant situation, I can assure you!"\r\n\r\nThis involuntary confession seemed to strike M. Hennebeau. He listened\r\nand a plan formed within him: in case the strike turned out badly,\r\nwhy not utilize it by letting things run down until his neighbour was\r\nruined, and then buy up his concession at a low price? That would be\r\nthe surest way of regaining the good graces of the directors, who for\r\nyears had dreamed of possessing Vandame.\r\n\r\n"If Jean-Bart bothers you as much as that," said he, laughing, "why\r\ndon\'t you give it up to us?"\r\n\r\nBut Deneulin was already regretting his complaints. He exclaimed:\r\n\r\n"Never, never!"\r\n\r\nThey were amused at his vigour and had already forgotten the strike\r\nby the time the dessert appeared. An apple-charlotte meringue was\r\noverwhelmed with praise. Afterwards the ladies discussed a recipe with\r\nrespect to the pineapple which was declared equally exquisite. The\r\ngrapes and pears completed their happy abandonment at the end of this\r\ncopious lunch. All talked excitedly at the same time, while the servant\r\npoured out Rhine wine in place of champagne which was looked upon as\r\ncommonplace.\r\n\r\nAnd the marriage of Paul and C\xc3\xa9cile certainly made a forward step in\r\nthe sympathy produced by the dessert. His aunt had thrown such urgent\r\nlooks in his direction, that the young man showed himself very amiable,\r\nand in his wheedling way reconquered the Gr\xc3\xa9goires, who had been cast\r\ndown by his stories of pillage. For a moment M. Hennebeau, seeing\r\nthe close understanding between his wife and his nephew, felt that\r\nabominable suspicion again revive, as if in this exchange of looks he\r\nhad surprised a physical contact. But again the idea of the marriage,\r\nmade here before his face, reassured him.\r\n\r\nHippolyte was serving the coffee when the housemaid entered in a fright.\r\n\r\n"Sir, sir, they are here!"\r\n\r\nIt was the delegates. Doors banged; a breath of terror was passing\r\nthrough the neighbouring rooms.\r\n\r\nAround the table the guests were looking at one another with uneasy\r\nindecision. There was silence. Then they tried to resume their jokes:\r\nthey pretended to put the rest of the sugar in their pockets, and\r\ntalked of hiding the plate. But the manager remained grave; and the\r\nlaughter fell and their voices sank to a whisper, while the heavy feet\r\nof the delegates who were being shown in tramped over the carpet of the\r\nnext room.\r\n\r\nMadame Hennebeau said to her husband, lowering her voice:\r\n\r\n"I hope you will drink your coffee."\r\n\r\n"Certainly," he replied. "Let them wait."\r\n\r\nHe was nervous, listening to every sound, though apparently occupied\r\nwith his cup.\r\n\r\nPaul and C\xc3\xa9cile got up, and he made her venture an eye to the keyhole.\r\nThey were stifling their laughter and talking in a low voice.\r\n\r\n"Do you see them?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I see a big man and two small ones behind."\r\n\r\n"Haven\'t they ugly faces?"\r\n\r\n"Not at all; they are very nice."\r\n\r\nSuddenly M. Hennebeau left his chair, saying the coffee was too hot and\r\nhe would drink it afterwards. As he went out he put a finger to his\r\nlips to recommend prudence. They all sat down again and remained at\r\ntable in silence, no longer daring to move, listening from afar with\r\nintent ears jarred by these coarse male voices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nThe previous day, at a meeting held at Rasseneur\'s, \xc3\x89tienne and some\r\ncomrades had chosen the delegates who were to proceed on the following\r\nday to the manager\'s house. When, in the evening, Maheude learnt that\r\nher man was one of them, she was in despair, and asked him if he\r\nwanted them to be thrown on the street. Maheu himself had agreed with\r\nreluctance. Both of them, when the moment of action came, in spite of\r\nthe injustice of their wretchedness fell back on the resignation of\r\ntheir race, trembling before the morrow, preferring still to bend their\r\nbacks to the yoke. In the management of affairs he usually gave way to\r\nhis wife, whose advice was sound. This time, however, he grew angry at\r\nlast, all the more so since he secretly shared her fears.\r\n\r\n"Just leave me alone, will you?" he said, going to bed and turning his\r\nback. "A fine thing to leave the mates now! I\'m doing my duty."\r\n\r\nShe went to bed in her turn. Neither of them spoke. Then, after a long\r\nsilence, she replied:\r\n\r\n"You\'re right; go. Only, poor old man, we are done for."\r\n\r\nMidday struck while they were at lunch, for the rendezvous was at\r\none o\'clock at the Avantage, from which they were to go together to\r\nM. Hennebeau\'s. They were eating potatoes. As there was only a small\r\nmorsel of butter left, no one touched it. They would have bread and\r\nbutter in the evening.\r\n\r\n"You know that we reckon on you to speak," said \xc3\x89tienne suddenly to\r\nMaheu.\r\n\r\nThe latter was so overcome that he was silent from emotion.\r\n\r\n"No, no! that\'s too much," cried Maheude. "I\'m quite willing he should\r\ngo there, but I don\'t allow him to go at the head. Why him, more than\r\nany one else?"\r\n\r\nThen \xc3\x89tienne, with his fiery eloquence, began to explain. Maheu was\r\nthe best worker in the pit, the most liked, and the most respected;\r\nwhose good sense was always spoken of. In his mouth the miners\' claims\r\nwould carry decisive weight. At first \xc3\x89tienne had arranged to speak,\r\nbut he had been at Montsou for too short a time. One who belonged to\r\nthe country would be better listened to. In fact, the comrades were\r\nconfiding their interests to the most worthy; he could not refuse, it\r\nwould be cowardly.\r\n\r\nMaheude made a gesture of despair.\r\n\r\n"Go, go, my man; go and be killed for the others. I\'m willing, after\r\nall!"\r\n\r\n"But I could never do it," stammered Maheu. "I should say something\r\nstupid."\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne, glad to have persuaded him, struck him on the shoulder.\r\n\r\n"Say what you feel, and you won\'t go wrong."\r\n\r\nFather Bonnemort, whose legs were now less swollen, was listening with\r\nhis mouth full, shaking his head. There was silence. When potatoes were\r\nbeing eaten, the children were subdued and behaved well. Then, having\r\nswallowed his mouthful, the old man muttered slowly:\r\n\r\n"You can say what you like, and it will be all the same as if you said\r\nnothing. Ah! I\'ve seen these affairs, I\'ve seen them! Forty years ago\r\nthey drove us out of the manager\'s house, and with sabres too! Now they\r\nmay receive you, perhaps, but they won\'t answer you any more than that\r\nwall. Lord! they have money, why should they care?"\r\n\r\nThere was silence again; Maheu and \xc3\x89tienne rose, and left the family\r\nin gloom before the empty plates. On going out they called for Pierron\r\nand Levaque, and then all four went to Rasseneur\'s, where the delegates\r\nfrom the neighbouring settlements were arriving in little groups.\r\nWhen the twenty members of the deputation had assembled there, they\r\nsettled on the terms to be opposed to the Company\'s, and then set out\r\nfor Montsou. The keen north-east wind was sweeping the street. As they\r\narrived, it struck two.\r\n\r\nAt first the servant told them to wait, and shut the door on them;\r\nthen, when he came back, he introduced them into the drawing-room, and\r\nopened the curtains. A soft daylight entered, sifted through the lace.\r\nAnd the miners, when left alone, in their embarrassment did not dare\r\nto sit; all of them very clean, dressed in cloth, shaven that morning,\r\nwith their yellow hair and moustaches. They twisted their caps between\r\ntheir fingers, and looked sideways at the furniture, which was in every\r\nvariety of style, as a result of the taste for the old-fashioned: Henry\r\nII easy-chairs, Louis XV chairs, an Italian cabinet of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, a Spanish contador of the fifteenth century, with an\r\naltar-front serving as a chimney-piece, and ancient chasuble trimming\r\nreapplied to the curtains. This old gold and these old silks, with\r\ntheir tawny tones, all this luxurious church furniture, had overwhelmed\r\nthem with respectful discomfort. The eastern carpets with their long\r\nwool seemed to bind their feet. But what especially suffocated them was\r\nthe heat, heat like that of a hot-air stove, which surprised them as\r\nthey felt it with cheeks frozen from the wind of the road. Five minutes\r\npassed by and their awkwardness increased in the comfort of this rich\r\nroom, so pleasantly warm. At last M. Hennebeau entered, buttoned up in\r\na military manner and wearing on his frock-coat the correct little bow\r\nof his decoration. He spoke first.\r\n\r\n"Ah! here you are! You are in rebellion, it seems."\r\n\r\nHe interrupted himself to add with polite stiffness:\r\n\r\n"Sit down, I desire nothing better than to talk things over."\r\n\r\nThe miners turned round looking for seats. A few of them ventured\r\nto place themselves on chairs, while the others, disturbed by the\r\nembroidered silks, preferred to remain standing.\r\n\r\nThere was a period of silence. M. Hennebeau, who had drawn his\r\neasy-chair up to the fireplace, was rapidly looking them over and\r\nendeavouring to recall their faces. He had recognized Pierron, who was\r\nhidden in the last row, and his eyes rested on \xc3\x89tienne who was seated\r\nin front of him.\r\n\r\n"Well," he asked, "what have you to say to me?"\r\n\r\nHe had expected to hear the young man speak and he was so surprised to\r\nsee Maheu come forward that he could not avoid adding:\r\n\r\n"What! you, a good workman who have always been so sensible, one of the\r\nold Montsou people whose family has worked in the mine since the first\r\nstroke of the axe! Ah! it\'s a pity, I\'m sorry that you are at the head\r\nof the discontented."\r\n\r\nMaheu listened with his eyes down. Then he began, at first in a low and\r\nhesitating voice.\r\n\r\n"It is just because I am a quiet man, sir, whom no one has anything\r\nagainst, that my mates have chosen me. That ought to show you that it\r\nisn\'t just a rebellion of blusterers, badly-disposed men who want to\r\ncreate disorder. We only want justice, we are tired of starving, and it\r\nseems to us that the time has come when things ought to be arranged so\r\nthat we can at least have bread every day."\r\n\r\nHis voice grew stronger. He lifted his eyes and went on, while looking\r\nat the manager.\r\n\r\n"You know quite well that we cannot agree to your new system. They\r\naccuse us of bad timbering. It\'s true we don\'t give the necessary time\r\nto the work. But if we gave it, our day\'s work would be still smaller,\r\nand as it doesn\'t give us enough food at present, that would mean the\r\nend of everything, the sweep of the clout that would wipe off all your\r\nmen. Pay us more and we will timber better, we will give the necessary\r\nhours to the timbering instead of putting all our strength into the\r\npicking, which is the only work that pays. There\'s no other arrangement\r\npossible; if the work is to be done it must be paid for. And what have\r\nyou invented instead? A thing which we can\'t get into our heads, don\'t\r\nyou see? You lower the price of the tram and then you pretend to make\r\nup for it by paying for all timbering separately. If that was true\r\nwe should be robbed all the same, for the timbering would still take\r\nus more time. But what makes us mad is that it isn\'t even true; the\r\nCompany compensates for nothing at all, it simply puts two centimes a\r\ntram into its pocket, that\'s all."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, that\'s it," murmured the other deputies, noticing M.\r\nHennebeau make a violent movement as if to interrupt.\r\n\r\nBut Maheu cut the manager short. Now that he had set out his words\r\ncame by themselves. At times he listened to himself with surprise as\r\nthough a stranger were speaking within him. It was the things amassed\r\nwithin his breast, things he did not even know were there, and which\r\ncame out in an expansion of his heart. He described the wretchedness\r\nthat was common to all of them, the hard toil, the brutal life, the\r\nwife and little ones crying from hunger in the house. He quoted the\r\nrecent disastrous payments, the absurd fortnightly wages, eaten up by\r\nfines and rest days and brought back to their families in tears. Was it\r\nresolved to destroy them?\r\n\r\n"Then, sir," he concluded, "we have come to tell you that if we\'ve got\r\nto starve we would rather starve doing nothing. It will be a little\r\nless trouble. We have left the pits and we don\'t go down again unless\r\nthe Company agrees to our terms. The Company wants to lower the price\r\nof the tram and to pay for the timbering separately. We ask for things\r\nto be left as they were, and we also ask for five centimes more the\r\ntram. Now it is for you to see if you are on the side of justice and\r\nwork."\r\n\r\nVoices rose among the miners.\r\n\r\n"That\'s it--he has said what we all feel--we only ask what\'s reason."\r\n\r\nOthers, without speaking, showed their approval by nodding their heads.\r\nThe luxurious room had disappeared, with its gold and its embroideries,\r\nits mysterious piling up of ancient things; and they no longer even\r\nfelt the carpet which they crushed beneath their heavy boots.\r\n\r\n"Let me reply, then," at last exclaimed M. Hennebeau, who was growing\r\nangry. "First of all, it is not true that the Company gains two\r\ncentimes the tram. Let us look at the figures."\r\n\r\nA confused discussion followed. The manager, trying to divide them,\r\nappealed to Pierron, who hid himself, stammering. Levaque, on the\r\ncontrary, was at the head of the more aggressive, muddling up things\r\nand affirming facts of which he was ignorant. The loud murmurs of their\r\nvoices were stifled beneath the hangings in the hot-house atmosphere.\r\n\r\n"If you all talk at the same time," said M. Hennebeau, "we shall never\r\ncome to an understanding."\r\n\r\nHe had regained his calmness, the rough politeness, without bitterness,\r\nof an agent who has received his instructions, and means that they\r\nshall be respected. From the first word he never took his eye off\r\n\xc3\x89tienne, and manoeuvred to draw the young man out of his obstinate\r\nsilence. Leaving the discussion about the two centimes, he suddenly\r\nenlarged the question.\r\n\r\n"No, acknowledge the truth: you are yielding to abominable incitations.\r\nIt is a plague which is now blowing over the workers everywhere, and\r\ncorrupting the best. Oh! I have no need for any one to confess. I can\r\nsee well that you have been changed, you who used to be so quiet. Is\r\nit not so? You have been promised more butter than bread, and you have\r\nbeen told that now your turn has come to be masters. In fact, you have\r\nbeen enrolled in that famous International, that army of brigands who\r\ndream of destroying society."\r\n\r\nThen \xc3\x89tienne interrupted him.\r\n\r\n"You are mistaken, sir. Not a single Montsou collier has yet enrolled.\r\nBut if they are driven to it, all the pits will enroll themselves. That\r\ndepends on the Company."\r\n\r\nFrom that moment the struggle went on between M. Hennebeau and \xc3\x89tienne\r\nas though the other miners were no longer there.\r\n\r\n"The Company is a Providence for the men, and you are wrong to threaten\r\nit. This year it has spent three hundred thousand francs in building\r\nsettlements which only return two per cent, and I say nothing of the\r\npensions which it pays, nor of the coals and medicines which it gives.\r\nYou who seem to be intelligent, and who have become in a few months\r\none of our most skilful workmen, would it not be better if you were\r\nto spread these truths, rather than ruin yourself by associating with\r\npeople of bad reputation? Yes, I mean Rasseneur, whom we had to turn\r\noff in order to save our pits from socialistic corruption. You are\r\nconstantly seen with him, and it is certainly he who has induced you\r\nto form this Provident Fund, which we would willingly tolerate if it\r\nwere merely a means of saving, but which we feel to be a weapon turned\r\nagainst us, a reserve fund to pay the expenses of the war. And in this\r\nconnection I ought to add that the Company means to control that fund."\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne allowed him to continue, fixing his eyes on him, while a slight\r\nnervous quiver moved his lips. He smiled at the last remark, and simply\r\nreplied:\r\n\r\n"Then that is a new demand, for until now, sir, you have neglected\r\nto claim that control. Unfortunately, we wish the Company to occupy\r\nitself less with us, and instead of playing the part of Providence\r\nto be merely just with us, giving us our due, the profits which\r\nit appropriates. Is it honest, whenever a crisis comes, to leave\r\nthe workers to die with hunger in order to save the shareholders\'\r\ndividends? Whatever you may say, sir, the new system is a disguised\r\nreduction of wages, and that is what we are rebelling against, for if\r\nthe Company wants to economize it acts very badly by only economizing\r\non the men."\r\n\r\n"Ah! there we are!" cried M. Hennebeau. "I was expecting that--the\r\naccusation of starving the people and living by their sweat. How can\r\nyou talk such folly, you who ought to know the enormous risks which\r\ncapital runs in industry--in the mines, for example? A well-equipped\r\npit today costs from fifteen hundred thousand francs to two millions;\r\nand it is difficult enough to get a moderate interest on the vast sum\r\nthat is thus swallowed. Nearly half the mining companies in France are\r\nbankrupt. Besides, it is stupid to accuse those who succeed of cruelty.\r\nWhen their workers suffer, they suffer themselves. Can you believe that\r\nthe Company has not as much to lose as you have in the present crisis?\r\nIt does not govern wages; it obeys competition under pain of ruin.\r\nBlame the facts, not the Company. But you don\'t wish to hear, you don\'t\r\nwish to understand."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said the young man, "we understand very well that our lot will\r\nnever be bettered as long as things go on as they are going; and that\r\nis the reason why some day or another the workers will end by arranging\r\nthat things shall go differently."\r\n\r\nThis sentence, so moderate in form, was pronounced in a low voice,\r\nbut with such conviction, tremulous in its menace, that a deep\r\nsilence followed. A certain constraint, a breath of fear passed\r\nthrough the polite drawing-room. The other delegates, though scarcely\r\nunderstanding, felt that their comrade had been demanding their share\r\nof this comfort; and they began to cast sidelong looks over the warm\r\nhangings, the comfortable seats, all this luxury of which the least\r\nknick-knack would have bought them soup for a month.\r\n\r\nAt last M. Hennebeau, who had remained thoughtful, rose as a sign for\r\nthem to depart. All imitated him. \xc3\x89tienne had lightly pushed Maheu\'s\r\nelbow, and the latter, his tongue once more thick and awkward, again\r\nspoke.\r\n\r\n"Then, sir, that is all that you reply? We must tell the others that\r\nyou reject our terms."\r\n\r\n"I, my good fellow!" exclaimed the manager, "I reject nothing. I am\r\npaid just as you are. I have no more power in the matter than the\r\nsmallest of your trammers. I receive my orders, and my only duty is\r\nto see that they are executed. I have told you what I thought I ought\r\nto tell you, but it is not for me to decide. You have brought me your\r\ndemands. I will make them known to the directors, then I will tell you\r\ntheir reply."\r\n\r\nHe spoke with the correct air of a high official avoiding any\r\npassionate interest in the matter, with the courteous dryness of a\r\nsimple instrument of authority. And the miners now looked at him with\r\ndistrust, asking themselves what interest he might have in lying, and\r\nwhat he would get by thus putting himself between them and the real\r\nmasters. A schemer, perhaps, this man who was paid like a worker, and\r\nwho lived so well!\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne ventured to intervene again.\r\n\r\n"You see, sir, how unfortunate it is that we cannot plead our cause in\r\nperson. We could explain many things, and bring forward many reasons of\r\nwhich you could know nothing, if we only knew where we ought to go."\r\n\r\nM. Hennebeau was not at all angry. He even smiled.\r\n\r\n"Ah! it gets complicated as soon as you have no confidence in me; you\r\nwill have to go over there."\r\n\r\nThe delegates had followed the vague gesture of his hand toward one\r\nof the windows. Where was it, over there? Paris, no doubt. But they\r\ndid not know exactly; it seemed to fall back into a terrible distance,\r\nin an inaccessible religious country, where an unknown god sat on his\r\nthrone, crouching down at the far end of his tabernacle. They would\r\nnever see him; they only felt him as a force far off, which weighed on\r\nthe ten thousand colliers of Montsou. And when the director spoke he\r\nhad that hidden force behind him delivering oracles.\r\n\r\nThey were overwhelmed with discouragement; \xc3\x89tienne himself signified\r\nby a shrug of the shoulders that it would be best to go; while M.\r\nHennebeau touched Maheu\'s arm in a friendly way and asked after Jeanlin.\r\n\r\n"That is a severe lesson now, and it is you who defend bad timbering.\r\nYou must reflect, my friends; you must realize that a strike would be\r\na disaster for everybody. Before a week you would die of hunger. What\r\nwould you do? I count on your good sense, anyhow; and I am convinced\r\nthat you will go down on Monday, at the latest."\r\n\r\nThey all left, going out of the drawing-room with the tramping of\r\na flock and rounded backs, without replying a word to this hope of\r\nsubmission. The manager, who accompanied them, was obliged to continue\r\nthe conversation. The Company, on the one side, had its new tariff; the\r\nworkers, on the other, their demand for an increase of five centimes\r\nthe tram. In order that they might have no illusions, he felt he ought\r\nto warn them that their terms would certainly be rejected by the\r\ndirectors.\r\n\r\n"Reflect before committing any follies," he repeated, disturbed at\r\ntheir silence.\r\n\r\nIn the porch Pierron bowed very low, while Levaque pretended to adjust\r\nhis cap. Maheu was trying to find something to say before leaving, when\r\n\xc3\x89tienne again touched his elbow. And they all left in the midst of this\r\nthreatening silence. The door closed with a loud bang.\r\n\r\nWhen M. Hennebeau re-entered the dining-room he found his guests\r\nmotionless and silent before the liqueurs. In two words he told his\r\nstory to Deneulin, whose face grew still more gloomy. Then, as he\r\ndrank his cold coffee, they tried to speak of other things. But the\r\nGr\xc3\xa9goires themselves returned to the subject of the strike, expressing\r\ntheir astonishment that no laws existed to prevent workmen from leaving\r\ntheir work. Paul reassured C\xc3\xa9cile, stating that they were expecting the\r\npolice.\r\n\r\nAt last Madame Hennebeau called the servant:\r\n\r\n"Hippolyte, before we go into the drawing-room just open the windows\r\nand let in a little air."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nA fortnight had passed, and on the Monday of the third week the lists\r\nsent up to the managers showed a fresh decrease in the number of the\r\nminers who had gone down. It was expected that on that morning work\r\nwould be resumed, but the obstinacy of the directors in not yielding\r\nexasperated the miners. The Voreux, Cr\xc3\xa9vecoeur, Mirou, and Madeleine\r\nwere not the only pits resting; at the Victoire and at Feutry-Cantel\r\nonly about a quarter of the men had gone down; even Saint-Thomas was\r\naffected. The strike was gradually becoming general.\r\n\r\nAt the Voreux a heavy silence hung over the pit-mouth. It was a dead\r\nworkshop, these great empty abandoned Yards where work was sleeping.\r\nIn the grey December sky, along the high foot-bridges three or four\r\nempty trams bore witness to the mute sadness of things. Underneath,\r\nbetween the slender posts of the platforms, the stock of coal was\r\ndiminishing, leaving the earth bare and black; while the supplies of\r\nwood were mouldering beneath the rain. At the quay on the canal a barge\r\nwas moored, half-laden, lying drowsily in the murky water; and on the\r\ndeserted pit-bank, in which the decomposed sulphates smoked in spite of\r\nthe rain, a melancholy cart showed its shafts erect. But the buildings\r\nespecially were growing torpid, the screening-shed with closed\r\nshutters, the steeple in which the rumbling of the receiving-room no\r\nmore arose, and the machine-room grown cold, and the giant chimney too\r\nlarge for the occasional smoke. The winding-engine was only heated\r\nin the morning. The grooms sent down fodder for the horses, and the\r\ncaptains worked alone at the bottom, having become labourers again,\r\nwatching over the damages that took place in the passages as soon as\r\nthey ceased to be repaired; then, after nine o\'clock the rest of the\r\nservice was carried on by the ladders. And above these dead buildings,\r\nburied in their garment of black dust, there was only heard the\r\nescapement of the pumping-engine, breathing with its thick, long breath\r\nall that was left of the life of the pit, which the water would destroy\r\nif that breathing should cease.\r\n\r\nOn the plain opposite, the settlement of the Deux-Cent-Quarante seemed\r\nalso to be dead. The prefect of Lille had come in haste and the\r\npolice had tramped all the roads; but in face of the calmness of the\r\nstrikers, prefect and police had decided to go home again. Never had\r\nthe settlement given so splendid an example in the vast plain. The\r\nmen, to avoid going to the public-house, slept all day long; the women\r\nwhile dividing the coffee became reasonable, less anxious to gossip and\r\nquarrel; and even the troops of children seemed to understand it all,\r\nand were so good that they ran about with naked feet, smacking each\r\nother silently. The word of command had been repeated and circulated\r\nfrom mouth to mouth; they wished to be sensible.\r\n\r\nThere was, however, a continuous coming and going of people in the\r\nMaheus\' house. \xc3\x89tienne, as secretary, had divided the three thousand\r\nfrancs of the Provident Fund among the needy families; afterwards\r\nfrom various sides several hundred francs had arrived, yielded by\r\nsubscriptions and collections. But now all their resources were\r\nexhausted; the miners had no more money to keep up the strike, and\r\nhunger was there, threatening them. Maigrat, after having promised\r\ncredit for a fortnight, had suddenly altered his mind at the end of\r\na week and cut off provisions. He usually took his orders from the\r\nCompany; perhaps the latter wished to bring the matter to an end by\r\nstarving the settlements. He acted besides like a capricious tyrant,\r\ngiving or refusing bread according to the look of the girl who was\r\nsent by her parents for provisions; and he especially closed his door\r\nspitefully to Maheude, wishing to punish her because he had not been\r\nable to get Catherine. To complete their misery it was freezing very\r\nhard, and the women watched their piles of coal diminish, thinking\r\nanxiously that they could no longer renew them at the pits now that the\r\nmen were not going down. It was not enough to die of hunger, they must\r\nalso die of cold.\r\n\r\nAmong the Maheus everything was already running short. The Levaques\r\ncould still eat on the strength of a twenty-franc piece lent by\r\nBouteloup. As to the Pierrons, they always had money; but in order\r\nto appear as needy as the others, for fear of loans, they got their\r\nsupplies on credit from Maigrat, who would have thrown his shop at\r\nPierronne if she had held out her petticoat to him. Since Saturday many\r\nfamilies had gone to bed without supper, and in face of the terrible\r\ndays that were beginning not a complaint was heard, all obeyed the word\r\nof command with quiet courage. There was an absolute confidence in\r\nspite of everything, a religious faith, the blind gift of a population\r\nof believers. Since an era of justice had been promised to them they\r\nwere willing to suffer for the conquest of universal happiness. Hunger\r\nexalted their heads; never had the low horizon opened a larger beyond\r\nto these people in the hallucination of their misery. They saw again\r\nover there, when their eyes were dimmed by weakness, the ideal city\r\nof their dream, but now growing near and seeming to be real, with its\r\npopulation of brothers, its golden age of labour and meals in common.\r\nNothing overcame their conviction that they were at last entering it.\r\nThe fund was exhausted; the Company would not yield; every day must\r\naggravate the situation; and they preserved their hope and showed a\r\nsmiling contempt for facts. If the earth opened beneath them a miracle\r\nwould save them. This faith replaced bread and warmed their stomachs.\r\nWhen the Maheus and the others had too quickly digested their soup,\r\nmade with clear water, they thus rose into a state of semi-vertigo,\r\nthat ecstasy of a better life which has flung martyrs to the wild\r\nbeasts.\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne was henceforth the unquestioned leader. In the evening\r\nconversations he gave forth oracles, in the degree to which study\r\nhad refined him and made him able to enter into difficult matters.\r\nHe spent the nights reading, and received a large number of letters;\r\nhe even subscribed to the _Vengeur_, a Belgian Socialist paper,\r\nand this journal, the first to enter the settlement, gained for him\r\nextraordinary consideration among his mates. His growing popularity\r\nexcited him more every day. To carry on an extensive correspondence, to\r\ndiscuss the fate of the workers in the four corners of the province,\r\nto give advice to the Voreux miners, especially to become a centre and\r\nto feel the world rolling round him--continually swelled the vanity\r\nof the former engine-man, the pikeman with greasy black hands. He\r\nwas climbing a ladder, he was entering this execrated middle class,\r\nwith a satisfaction to his intelligence and comfort which he did not\r\nconfess to himself. He had only one trouble, the consciousness of\r\nhis lack of education, which made him embarrassed and timid as soon\r\nas he was in the presence of a gentleman in a frock-coat. If he went\r\non instructing himself, devouring everything, the lack of method\r\nwould render assimilation very slow, and would produce such confusion\r\nthat at last he would know much more than he could understand. So at\r\ncertain hours of good sense he experienced a restlessness with regard\r\nto his mission--a fear that he was not the man for the task. Perhaps\r\nit required a lawyer, a learned man, able to speak and act without\r\ncompromising the mates? But an outcry soon restored his assurance. No,\r\nno; no lawyers! They are all rascals; they profit by their knowledge to\r\nfatten on the people. Let things turn out how they will, the workers\r\nmust manage their own affairs. And his dream of popular leadership\r\nagain soothed him: Montsou at his feet, Paris in the misty distance,\r\nwho knows? The elections some day, the tribune in a gorgeous hall,\r\nwhere he could thunder against the middle class in the first speech\r\npronounced by a workman in a parliament.\r\n\r\nDuring the last few days \xc3\x89tienne had been perplexed. Pluchart wrote\r\nletter after letter, offering to come to Montsou to quicken the zeal\r\nof the strikers. It was a question of organizing a private meeting\r\nover which the mechanic would preside; and beneath this plan lay the\r\nidea of exploiting the strike, to gain over to the International these\r\nminers who so far had shown themselves suspicious. \xc3\x89tienne feared a\r\ndisturbance, but he would, however, have allowed Pluchart to come if\r\nRasseneur had not violently blamed this proceeding. In spite of his\r\npower, the young man had to reckon with the innkeeper, whose services\r\nwere of older date, and who had faithful followers among his clients.\r\nSo he still hesitated, not knowing what to reply.\r\n\r\nOn this very Monday, towards four o\'clock, a new letter came from Lille\r\nas \xc3\x89tienne was alone with Maheude in the lower room. Maheu, weary of\r\nidleness, had gone fishing; if he had the luck to catch a fine fish\r\nunder the sluice of the canal, they could sell it to buy bread. Old\r\nBonnemort and little Jeanlin had just gone off to try their legs,\r\nwhich were now restored; while the children had departed with Alzire,\r\nwho spent hours on the pit-bank collecting cinders. Seated near the\r\nmiserable fire, which they no longer dared to keep up, Maheude, with\r\nher dress unbuttoned and one breast hanging out of her dress and\r\nfalling to her belly, was suckling Estelle.\r\n\r\nWhen the young man had folded the letter, she questioned him:\r\n\r\n"Is the news good? Are they going to send us any money?"\r\n\r\nHe shook his head, and she went on:\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what we shall do this week. However, we\'ll hold on all\r\nthe same. When one has right on one\'s side, don\'t you think it gives\r\nyou heart, and one ends always by being the strongest?"\r\n\r\nAt the present time she was, to a reasonable extent, in favour of the\r\nstrike. It would have been better to force the Company to be just\r\nwithout leaving off work. But since they had left it they ought not\r\nto go back to it without obtaining justice. On this point she was\r\nrelentless. Better to die than to show oneself in the wrong when one\r\nwas right!\r\n\r\n"Ah!" exclaimed \xc3\x89tienne, "if a fine old cholera was to break out, that\r\nwould free us of all these Company exploiters."\r\n\r\n"No, no," she replied, "we must not wish any one dead. That wouldn\'t\r\nhelp us at all; plenty more would spring up. Now I only ask that they\r\nshould get sensible ideas, and I expect they will, for there are worthy\r\npeople everywhere. You know I\'m not at all for your politics."\r\n\r\nIn fact she always blamed his violent language, and thought him\r\naggressive. It was good that they should want their work paid for at\r\nwhat it was worth, but why occupy oneself with such things as the\r\nbourgeois and Government? Why mix oneself up with other people\'s\r\naffairs, when one would get nothing out of it but hard knocks? And she\r\nkept her esteem for him because he did not get drunk, and regularly\r\npaid his forty-five francs for board and lodging. When a man behaves\r\nwell one can forgive him the rest.\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne then talked about the Republic, which would give bread to\r\neverybody. But Maheude shook her head, for she remembered 1848, an\r\nawful year, which had left them as bare as worms, her and her man, in\r\ntheir early housekeeping years. She forgot herself in describing its\r\nhorrors, in a mournful voice, her eyes lost in space, her breast open;\r\nwhile her infant, Estelle, without letting it go, had fallen asleep on\r\nher knees. And \xc3\x89tienne, also absorbed in thought, had his eyes fixed on\r\nthis enormous breast, of which the soft whiteness contrasted with the\r\nmuddy yellowish complexion of her face.\r\n\r\n"Not a farthing," she murmured, "nothing to put between one\'s teeth,\r\nand all the pits stopped. Just the same destruction of poor people as\r\nto-day."\r\n\r\nBut at that moment the door opened, and they remained mute with\r\nsurprise before Catherine, who then came in. Since her flight with\r\nChaval she had not reappeared at the settlement. Her emotion was so\r\ngreat that, trembling and silent, she forgot to shut the door. She\r\nexpected to find her mother alone, and the sight of the young man put\r\nout of her head the phrases she had prepared on the way.\r\n\r\n"What on earth have you come here for?" cried Maheude, without even\r\nmoving from her chair. "I don\'t want to have anything more to do with\r\nyou; get along."\r\n\r\nThen Catherine tried to find words:\r\n\r\n"Mother, it\'s some coffee and sugar; yes, for the children. I\'ve been\r\nthinking of them and done overtime."\r\n\r\nShe drew out of her pockets a pound of coffee and a pound of sugar,\r\nand took courage to place them on the table. The strike at the Voreux\r\ntroubled her while she was working at Jean-Bart, and she had only been\r\nable to think of this way of helping her parents a little, under the\r\npretext of caring for the little ones. But her good nature did not\r\ndisarm her mother, who replied:\r\n\r\n"Instead of bringing us sweets, you would have done better to stay and\r\nearn bread for us."\r\n\r\nShe overwhelmed her with abuse, relieving herself by throwing in her\r\ndaughter\'s face all that she had been saying against her for the past\r\nmonth. To go off with a man, to hang on to him at sixteen, when the\r\nfamily was in want! Only the most degraded of unnatural children could\r\ndo it. One could forgive a folly, but a mother never forgot a trick\r\nlike that. There might have been some excuse if they had been strict\r\nwith her. Not at all; she was as free as air, and they only asked her\r\nto come in to sleep.\r\n\r\n"Tell me, what have you got in your skin, at your age?"\r\n\r\nCatherine, standing beside the table, listened with lowered head. A\r\nquiver shook her thin under-developed girlish body, and she tried to\r\nreply in broken words:\r\n\r\n"Oh! if it was only me, and the amusement that I get! It\'s him. What\r\nhe wants I\'m obliged to want too, aren\'t I? because, you see, he\'s the\r\nstrongest. How can one tell how things are going to turn out? Anyhow\r\nit\'s done and can\'t be undone; it may as well be him as another now.\r\nHe\'ll have to marry me."\r\n\r\nShe defended herself without a struggle, with the passive resignation\r\nof a girl who has submitted to the male at an early age. Was it not the\r\ncommon lot? She had never dreamed of anything else; violence behind\r\nthe pit-bank, a child at sixteen, and then a wretched household if her\r\nlover married her. And she did not blush with shame; she only quivered\r\nlike this at being treated like a slut before this lad, whose presence\r\noppressed her to despair.\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne had risen, however, and was pretending to stir up the nearly\r\nextinct fire in order not to interrupt the explanation. But their looks\r\nmet; he found her pale and exhausted; pretty, indeed, with her clear\r\neyes in the face which had grown tanned, and he experienced a singular\r\nfeeling; his spite had vanished; he simply desired that she should\r\nbe happy with this man whom she had preferred to him. He felt the\r\nneed to occupy himself with her still, a longing to go to Montsou and\r\nforce the other man to his duty. But she only saw pity in his constant\r\ntenderness; he must feel contempt for her to gaze at her like that.\r\nThen her heart contracted so that she choked, without being able to\r\nstammer any more words of excuse.\r\n\r\n"That\'s it, you\'d best hold your tongue," began the implacable Maheude.\r\n"If you come back to stay, come in; else get along with you at once,\r\nand think yourself lucky that I\'m not free just now, or I should have\r\nput my foot into you somewhere before now."\r\n\r\nAs if this threat had suddenly been realized, Catherine received a\r\nvigorous kick right behind, so violent that she was stupefied with\r\nsurprise and pain. It was Chaval who had leapt in through the open door\r\nto give her this lunge of a vicious beast. For a moment he had watched\r\nher from outside.\r\n\r\n"Ah! slut," he yelled, "I\'ve followed you. I knew well enough you were\r\ncoming back here to get him to fill you. And it\'s you that pay him, eh?\r\nYou pour coffee down him with my money!"\r\n\r\nMaheude and \xc3\x89tienne were stupefied, and did not stir. With a furious\r\nmovement Chaval chased Catherine towards the door.\r\n\r\n"Out you go, by God!"\r\n\r\nAnd as she took refuge in a corner he turned on her mother.\r\n\r\n"A nice business, keeping watch while your whore of a daughter is\r\nkicking her legs upstairs!"\r\n\r\nAt last he caught Catherine\'s wrist, shaking her and dragging her out.\r\nAt the door he again turned towards Maheude, who was nailed to her\r\nchair. She had forgotten to fasten up her breast. Estelle had gone to\r\nsleep, and her face had slipped down into the woollen petticoat; the\r\nenormous breast was hanging free and naked like the udder of a great\r\ncow.\r\n\r\n"When the daughter is not at it, it\'s the mother who gets herself\r\nplugged," cried Chaval. "Go on, show him your meat! He isn\'t\r\ndisgusted--your dirty lodger!"\r\n\r\nAt this \xc3\x89tienne was about to strike his mate. The fear of arousing the\r\nsettlement by a fight had kept him back from snatching Catherine from\r\nChaval\'s hands. But rage was now carrying him away, and the two men\r\nwere face to face with inflamed eyes. It was an old hatred, a jealousy\r\nlong unacknowledged, which was breaking out. One of them now must do\r\nfor the other.\r\n\r\n"Take care!" stammered \xc3\x89tienne, with clenched teeth. "I\'ll do for you."\r\n\r\n"Try!" replied Chaval.\r\n\r\nThey looked at one another for some seconds longer, so close that\r\ntheir hot breaths burnt each other\'s faces. And it was Catherine who\r\nsuppliantly took her lover\'s hand again to lead him away. She dragged\r\nhim out of the settlement, fleeing without turning her head.\r\n\r\n"What a brute!" muttered \xc3\x89tienne, banging the door, and so shaken by\r\nanger that he was obliged to sit down.\r\n\r\nMaheude, in front of him, had not stirred. She made a vague gesture,\r\nand there was silence, a silence which was painful and heavy with\r\nunspoken things. In spite of an effort his gaze again returned to her\r\nbreast, that expanse of white flesh, the brilliance of which now made\r\nhim uncomfortable. No doubt she was forty, and had lost her shape, like\r\na good female who had produced too much; but many would still desire\r\nher, strong and solid, with the large long face of a woman who had once\r\nbeen beautiful. Slowly and quietly she was putting back her breast with\r\nboth hands. A rosy corner was still obstinate, and she pushed it back\r\nwith her finger, and then buttoned herself up, and was now quite black\r\nand shapeless in her old gown.\r\n\r\n"He\'s a filthy beast," she said at last. "Only a filthy beast could\r\nhave such nasty ideas. I don\'t care a hang what he says; it isn\'t worth\r\nnotice."\r\n\r\nThen in a frank voice she added, fixing her eyes on the young man:\r\n\r\n"I have my faults, sure enough, but not that one. Only two men have\r\ntouched me--a putter, long ago, when I was fifteen, and then Maheu. If\r\nhe had left me like the other, Lord! I don\'t quite know what would have\r\nhappened; and I don\'t pride myself either on my good conduct with him\r\nsince our marriage, because, when one hasn\'t gone wrong, it\'s often\r\nbecause one hasn\'t the chance. Only I say things as they are, and I\r\nknow neighbours who couldn\'t say as much, don\'t you think?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s true enough," replied \xc3\x89tienne.\r\n\r\nAnd he rose and went out, while she decided to light the fire again,\r\nafter having placed the sleeping Estelle on two chairs. If the father\r\ncaught and sold a fish they could manage to have some soup.\r\n\r\nOutside, night was already coming on, a frosty night; and with lowered\r\nhead \xc3\x89tienne walked along, sunk in dark melancholy. It was no longer\r\nanger against the man, or pity for the poor ill-treated girl. The\r\nbrutal scene was effaced and lost, and he was thrown back on to the\r\nsufferings of all, the abominations of wretchedness. He thought of the\r\nsettlement without bread, these women and little ones who would not\r\neat that evening, all this struggling race with empty bellies. And\r\nthe doubt which sometimes touched him awoke again in the frightful\r\nmelancholy of the twilight, and tortured him with a discomfort which he\r\nhad never felt so strongly before. With what a terrible responsibility\r\nhe had burdened himself! Must he still push them on in obstinate\r\nresistance, now that there was neither money nor credit? And what\r\nwould be the end of it all if no help arrived, and starvation came to\r\nbeat down their courage? He had a sudden vision of disaster; of dying\r\nchildren and sobbing mothers, while the men, lean and pale, went down\r\nonce more into the pits. He went on walking, his feet stumbling against\r\nthe stones, and the thought that the Company would be found strongest,\r\nand that he would have brought misfortune on his comrades, filled him\r\nwith insupportable anguish.\r\n\r\nWhen he raised his head he saw that he was in front of the Voreux. The\r\ngloomy mass of buildings looked sombre beneath the growing darkness.\r\nThe deserted square, obstructed by great motionless shadows, seemed\r\nlike the corner of an abandoned fortress. As soon as the winding-engine\r\nstopped, the soul left the place. At this hour of the night nothing was\r\nalive, not a lantern, not a voice; and the sound of the pump itself\r\nwas only a distant moan, coming one could not say whence, in this\r\nannihilation of the whole pit.\r\n\r\nAs \xc3\x89tienne gazed the blood flowed back to his heart. If the workers\r\nwere suffering hunger, the Company was encroaching on its millions. Why\r\nshould it prove the stronger in this war of labour against gold? In any\r\ncase, the victory would cost it dear. They would have their corpses to\r\ncount. He felt the fury of battle again, the fierce desire to have done\r\nwith misery, even at the price of death. It would be as well for the\r\nsettlement to die at one stroke as to go on dying in detail of famine\r\nand injustice. His ill-digested reading came back to him, examples of\r\nnations who had burnt their towns to arrest the enemy, vague histories\r\nof mothers who had saved their children from slavery by crushing their\r\nheads against the pavement, of men who had died of want rather than\r\neat the bread of tyrants. His head became exalted, a red gaiety arose\r\nout of his crisis of black sadness, chasing away doubt, and making\r\nhim ashamed of this passing cowardice of an hour. And in this revival\r\nof his faith, gusts of pride reappeared and carried him still higher;\r\nthe joy of being leader, of seeing himself obeyed, even to sacrifice,\r\nthe enlarged dream of his power, the evening of triumph. Already he\r\nimagined a scene of simple grandeur, his refusal of power, authority\r\nplaced in the hands of the people, when it would be master.\r\n\r\nBut he awoke and started at the voice of Maheu, who was narrating his\r\nluck, a superb trout which he had fished up and sold for three francs.\r\n\r\nThey would have their soup. Then he left his mate to return alone to\r\nthe settlement, saying that he would follow him; and he entered and\r\nsat down in the Avantage, awaiting the departure of a client to tell\r\nRasseneur decisively that he should write to Pluchart to come at once.\r\nHis resolution was taken; he would organize a private meeting, for\r\nvictory seemed to him certain if the Montsou colliers adhered in a mass\r\nto the International.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was at the Bon-Joyeux, Widow D\xc3\xa9sir\'s, that the private meeting was\r\norganized for Thursday at two o\'clock. The widow, incensed at the\r\nmiseries inflicted on her children the colliers, was in a constant\r\nstate of anger, especially as her inn was emptying. Never had there\r\nbeen a less thirsty strike; the drunkards had shut themselves up at\r\nhome for fear of disobeying the sober word of command. Thus Montsou,\r\nwhich swarmed with people on feast-days, now exhibited its wide street\r\nin mute and melancholy desolation. No beer flowed from counters or\r\nbellies, the gutters were dry. On the pavement at the Casimir Bar and\r\nthe Estaminet du Progr\xc3\xa9s one only saw the pale faces of the landladies,\r\nlooking inquiringly into the street; then in Montsou itself the\r\ndeserted doors extended from the Estaminet Lenfant to the Estaminet\r\nTison, passing by the Estaminet Piquette and the T\xc3\xaate-Coup\xc3\xa9e Bar; only\r\nthe Estaminet Saint-\xc3\x89loi, which was frequented by captains, still drew\r\noccasional glasses; the solitude even extended to the Volcan, where the\r\nladies were resting for lack of admirers, although they had lowered\r\ntheir price from ten sous to five in view of the hard times. A deep\r\nmourning was breaking the heart of the entire country.\r\n\r\n"By God!" exclaimed Widow D\xc3\xa9sir, slapping her thighs with both hands,\r\n"it\'s the fault of the gendarmes! Let them run me in, devil take them,\r\nif they like, but I must plague them."\r\n\r\nFor her, all authorities and masters were gendarmes; it was a term of\r\ngeneral contempt in which she enveloped all the enemies of the people.\r\nShe had greeted \xc3\x89tienne\'s request with transport; her whole house\r\nbelonged to the miners, she would lend her ball-room gratuitously,\r\nand would herself issue the invitations since the law required it.\r\nBesides, if the law was not pleased, so much the better! She would give\r\nthem a bit of her mind. Since yesterday the young man had brought her\r\nsome fifty letters to sign; he had them copied by neighbours in the\r\nsettlement who knew how to write, and these letters were sent around\r\namong the pits to delegates and to men of whom they were sure. The\r\navowed order of the day was a discussion regarding the continuation of\r\nthe strike; but in reality they were expecting Pluchart, and reckoning\r\non a discourse from him which would cause a general adhesion to the\r\nInternational.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday morning \xc3\x89tienne was disquieted by the non-appearance of his\r\nold foreman, who had promised by letter to arrive on Wednesday evening.\r\nWhat, then, was happening? He was annoyed that he would not be able to\r\ncome to an understanding with him before the meeting. At nine o\'clock\r\nhe went to Montsou, with the idea that the mechanic had, perhaps, gone\r\nthere direct without stopping at the Voreux.\r\n\r\n"No, I\'ve not seen your friend," replied Widow D\xc3\xa9sir. "But everything\r\nis ready. Come and see."\r\n\r\nShe led him into the ball-room. The decorations were the same, the\r\ngarlands which supported at the ceiling a crown of painted paper\r\nflowers, and the gilt cardboard shields in a line along the wall with\r\nthe names of saints, male and female. Only the musicians\' platform had\r\nbeen replaced by a table and three chairs in one corner; and the room\r\nwas furnished with forms ranged along the floor.\r\n\r\n"It\'s perfect," \xc3\x89tienne declared.\r\n\r\n"And you know," said the widow, "that you\'re at home here. Yell as much\r\nas you like. The gendarmes will have to pass over my body if they do\r\ncome!"\r\n\r\nIn spite of his anxiety, he could not help smiling when he looked at\r\nher, so vast did she appear, with a pair of breasts so huge that one\r\nalone would require a man to embrace it, which now led to the saying\r\nthat of her six weekday lovers she had to take two every evening on\r\naccount of the work.\r\n\r\nBut \xc3\x89tienne was astonished to see Rasseneur and Souvarine enter; and as\r\nthe widow left them all three in the large empty hall he exclaimed:\r\n\r\n"What! you here already!"\r\n\r\nSouvarine, who had worked all night at the Voreux, the engine-men not\r\nbeing on strike, had merely come out of curiosity. As to Rasseneur, he\r\nhad seemed constrained during the last two days, and his fat round face\r\nhad lost its good-natured laugh.\r\n\r\n"Pluchart has not arrived, and I am very anxious," added \xc3\x89tienne.\r\n\r\nThe innkeeper turned away his eyes, and replied between his teeth:\r\n\r\n"I\'m not surprised; I don\'t expect him."\r\n\r\n"What!"\r\n\r\nThen he made up his mind, and looking the other man in the face bravely:\r\n\r\n"I, too, have sent him a letter, if you want me to tell you; and in\r\nthat letter I have begged him not to come. Yes, I think we ought to\r\nmanage our own affairs ourselves, without turning to strangers."\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne, losing his self-possession and trembling with anger, turned\r\nhis eyes on his mate\'s and stammered:\r\n\r\n"You\'ve done that, you\'ve done that?"\r\n\r\n"I have done that, certainly! and you know that I trust Pluchart; he\'s\r\na knowing fellow and reliable, one can get on with him. But you see I\r\ndon\'t care a damn for your ideas, I don\'t! Politics, Government, and\r\nall that, I don\'t care a damn for it! What I want is for the miner to\r\nbe better treated. I have worked down below for twenty years, I\'ve\r\nsweated down there with fatigue and misery, and I\'ve sworn to make it\r\neasier for the poor beggars who are there still; and I know well enough\r\nyou\'ll never get anything with all your ideas, you\'ll only make the\r\nmen\'s fate more miserable still. When they are forced by hunger to go\r\ndown again, they will be more crushed than ever; the Company will pay\r\nthem with strokes of the stick, like a runaway dog who is brought back\r\nto his kennel. That\'s what I want to prevent, do you see!"\r\n\r\nHe raised his voice, protruding his belly and squarely planted on his\r\nbig legs. The man\'s whole patient, reasonable nature was revealed in\r\nclear phrases, which flowed abundantly without an effort. Was it not\r\nabsurd to believe that with one stroke one could change the world,\r\nputting the workers in the place of the masters and dividing gold as\r\none divides an apple? It would, perhaps, take thousands and thousands\r\nof years for that to be realized. There, hold your tongue, with your\r\nmiracles! The most sensible plan was, if one did not wish to break\r\none\'s nose, to go straight forward, to demand possible reforms, in\r\nshort, to improve the lot of the workers on every occasion. He did\r\nhis best, so far as he occupied himself with it, to bring the Company\r\nto better terms; if not, damn it all! they would only starve by being\r\nobstinate.\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne had let him speak, his own speech cut short by indignation.\r\nThen he cried:\r\n\r\n"Haven\'t you got any blood in your veins, by God?"\r\n\r\nAt one moment he would have struck him, and to resist the temptation\r\nhe rushed about the hall with long strides, venting his fury on the\r\nbenches through which he made a passage.\r\n\r\n"Shut the door, at all events," Souvarine remarked. "There is no need\r\nto be heard."\r\n\r\nHaving himself gone to shut it, he quietly sat down in one of the\r\noffice chairs. He had rolled a cigarette, and was looking at the other\r\ntwo men with his mild subtle eye, his lips drawn by a slight smile.\r\n\r\n"You won\'t get any farther by being angry," said Rasseneur judiciously.\r\n"I believed at first that you had good sense. It was sensible to\r\nrecommend calmness to the mates, to force them to keep indoors, and to\r\nuse your power to maintain order. And now you want to get them into a\r\nmess!"\r\n\r\nAt each turn in his walks among the benches, \xc3\x89tienne returned towards\r\nthe innkeeper, seizing him by the shoulders, shaking him, and shouting\r\nout his replies in his face.\r\n\r\n"But, blast it all! I mean to be calm. Yes, I have imposed order on\r\nthem! Yes, I do advise them still not to stir! only it doesn\'t do to be\r\nmade a joke of after all! You are lucky to remain cool. Now there are\r\nhours when I feel that I am losing my head."\r\n\r\nThis was a confession on his part. He railed at his illusions of a\r\nnovice, his religious dream of a city in which justice would soon\r\nreign among the men who had become brothers. A fine method truly!\r\nto cross one\'s arms and wait, if one wished to see men eating each\r\nother to the end of the world like wolves. No! one must interfere, or\r\ninjustice would be eternal, and the rich would for ever suck the blood\r\nof the poor. Therefore he could not forgive himself the stupidity\r\nof having said formerly that politics ought to be banished from the\r\nsocial question. He knew nothing then; now he had read and studied,\r\nhis ideas were ripe, and he boasted that he had a system. He explained\r\nit badly, however, in confused phrases which contained a little of\r\nall the theories he had successively passed through and abandoned.\r\nAt the summit Karl Marx\'s idea remained standing: capital was the\r\nresult of spoliation, it was the duty and the privilege of labour\r\nto reconquer that stolen wealth. In practice he had at first, with\r\nProudhon, been captured by the chimera of a mutual credit, a vast bank\r\nof exchange which suppressed middlemen; then Lassalle\'s cooperative\r\nsocieties, endowed by the state, gradually transforming the earth into\r\na single industrial town, had aroused his enthusiasm until he grew\r\ndisgusted in face of the difficulty of controlling them; and he had\r\narrived recently at collectivism, demanding that all the instruments\r\nof production should be restored to the community. But this remained\r\nvague; he knew not how to realize this new dream, still hindered by\r\nscruples of reason and good sense, not daring to risk the secretary\'s\r\nabsolute affirmations. He simply said that it was a question of getting\r\npossession of the government first of all. Afterwards they would see.\r\n\r\n"But what has taken you? Why are you going over to the bourgeois?" he\r\ncontinued violently, again planting himself before the innkeeper. "You\r\nsaid yourself it would have to burst up!"\r\n\r\nRasseneur blushed slightly.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I said so. And if it does burst up, you will see that I am no\r\nmore of a coward than any one else. Only I refuse to be among those who\r\nincrease the mess in order to fish out a position for themselves."\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne blushed in his turn. The two men no longer shouted, having\r\nbecome bitter and spiteful, conquered by the coldness of their rivalry.\r\nIt was at bottom that which always strains systems, making one man\r\nrevolutionary in the extreme, pushing the other to an affectation of\r\nprudence, carrying them, in spite of themselves, beyond their true\r\nideas into those fatal parts which men do not choose for themselves.\r\nAnd Souvarine, who was listening, exhibited on his pale, girlish face\r\na silent contempt--the crushing contempt of the man who was willing\r\nto yield his life in obscurity without even gaining the splendour of\r\nmartyrdom.\r\n\r\n"Then it\'s to me that you\'re saying that?" asked \xc3\x89tienne; "you\'re\r\njealous!"\r\n\r\n"Jealous of what?" replied Rasseneur. "I don\'t pose as a big man; I\'m\r\nnot trying to create a section at Montsou for the sake of being made\r\nsecretary."\r\n\r\nThe other man wanted to interrupt him, but he added:\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you be frank? You don\'t care a damn for the International;\r\nyou\'re only burning to be at our head, the gentleman who corresponds\r\nwith the famous Federal Council of the Nord!"\r\n\r\nThere was silence. \xc3\x89tienne replied, quivering:\r\n\r\n"Good! I don\'t think I have anything to reproach myself with. I always\r\nasked your advice, for I knew that you had fought here long before me.\r\nBut since you can\'t endure any one by your side, I\'ll act alone in\r\nfuture. And first I warn you that the meeting will take place even if\r\nPluchart does not come, and the mates will join in spite of you."\r\n\r\n"Oh! join!" muttered the innkeeper; "that\'s not enough. You\'ll have to\r\nget them to pay their subscriptions."\r\n\r\n"Not at all. The International grants time to workers on strike. It\r\nwill at once come to our help, and we shall pay later on."\r\n\r\nRasseneur was carried beyond himself.\r\n\r\n"Well, we shall see. I belong to this meeting of yours, and I shall\r\nspeak. I shall not let you turn our friends\' heads, I shall let them\r\nknow where their real interests lie. We shall see whom they mean to\r\nfollow--me, whom they have known for thirty years, or you, who have\r\nturned everything upside down among us in less than a year. No, no!\r\ndamn it all! We shall see which of us is going to crush the other."\r\n\r\nAnd he went out, banging the door. The garlands of flowers swayed from\r\nthe ceiling, and the gilt shields jumped against the walls. Then the\r\ngreat room fell back into its heavy calm.\r\n\r\nSouvarine was smoking in his quiet way, seated before the table.\r\nAfter having paced for a moment in silence, \xc3\x89tienne began to relieve\r\nhis feelings at length. Was it his fault if they had left that fat\r\nlazy fellow to come to him? And he defended himself from having ought\r\npopularity. He knew not even how it had happened, this friendliness\r\nof the settlement, the confidence of the miners, the power which he\r\nnow had over them. He was indignant at being accused of wishing to\r\nbring everything to confusion out of ambition; he struck his chest,\r\nprotesting his brotherly feelings.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he stopped before Souvarine and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n"Do you know, if I thought I should cost a drop of blood to a friend, I\r\nwould go off at once to America!"\r\n\r\nThe engine-man shrugged his shoulders, and a smile again came on his\r\nlips.\r\n\r\n"Oh! blood!" he murmured. "What does that matter? The earth has need of\r\nit."\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne, growing calm, took a chair, and put his elbows on the other\r\nside of the table. This fair face, with the dreamy eyes, which\r\nsometimes grew savage with a red light, disturbed him, and exercised\r\na singular power over his will. In spite of his comrade\'s silence,\r\nconquered even by that silence, he felt himself gradually absorbed.\r\n\r\n"Well," he asked, "what would you do in my place? Am I not right to act\r\nas I do? Isn\'t it best for us to join this association?"\r\n\r\nSouvarine, after having slowly ejected a jet of smoke, replied by his\r\nfavourite word:\r\n\r\n"Oh, foolery! but meanwhile it\'s always so. Besides, their\r\nInternational will soon begin to move. He has taken it up."\r\n\r\n"Who, then?"\r\n\r\n"He!"\r\n\r\nHe had pronounced this word in a whisper, with religious fervour,\r\ncasting a glance towards the east. He was speaking of the master,\r\nBakunin the destroyer.\r\n\r\n"He alone can give the thunderclap," he went on, "while your learned\r\nmen, with their evolution, are mere cowards. Before three years are\r\npast, the International, under his orders, will crush the old world."\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne pricked up his ears in attention. He was burning to gain\r\nknowledge, to understand this worship of destruction, regarding which\r\nthe engine-man only uttered occasional obscure words, as though he kept\r\ncertain mysteries to himself.\r\n\r\n"Well, but explain to me. What is your aim?"\r\n\r\n"To destroy everything. No more nations, no more governments, no more\r\nproperty, no more God nor worship."\r\n\r\n"I quite understand. Only what will that lead you to?"\r\n\r\n"To the primitive formless commune, to a new world, to the renewal of\r\neverything."\r\n\r\n"And the means of execution? How do you reckon to set about it?"\r\n\r\n"By fire, by poison, by the dagger. The brigand is the true hero, the\r\npopular avenger, the revolutionary in action, with no phrases drawn\r\nout of books. We need a series of tremendous outrages to frighten the\r\npowerful and to arouse the people."\r\n\r\nAs he talked, Souvarine grew terrible. An ecstasy raised him on his\r\nchair, a mystic flame darted from his pale eyes, and his delicate hands\r\ngripped the edge of the table almost to breaking. The other man looked\r\nat him in fear, and thought of the stories of which he had received\r\nvague intimation, of mines charged beneath the tsar\'s palace, of chiefs\r\nof police struck down by knives like wild boars, of his mistress, the\r\nonly woman he had loved, hanged at Moscow one rainy morning, while in\r\nthe crowd he kissed her with his eyes for the last time.\r\n\r\n"No! no!" murmured \xc3\x89tienne, as with a gesture he pushed away these\r\nabominable visions, "we haven\'t got to that yet over here. Murder and\r\nfire, never! It is monstrous, unjust, all the mates would rise and\r\nstrangle the guilty one!"\r\n\r\nAnd besides, he could not understand; the instincts of his race refused\r\nto accept this sombre dream of the extermination of the world, mown\r\nlevel like a rye-field. Then what would they do afterwards? How would\r\nthe nations spring up again? He demanded a reply.\r\n\r\n"Tell me your programme. We like to know where we are going to."\r\n\r\nThen Souvarine concluded peacefully, with his gaze fixed on space:\r\n\r\n"All reasoning about the future is criminal, because it prevents pure\r\ndestruction, and interferes with the progress of revolution."\r\n\r\nThis made \xc3\x89tienne laugh, in spite of the cold shiver which passed over\r\nhis flesh. Besides, he willingly acknowledged that there was something\r\nin these ideas, which attracted him by their fearful simplicity. Only\r\nit would be playing into Rasseneur\'s hands if he were to repeat such\r\nthings to his comrades. It was necessary to be practical.\r\n\r\nWidow D\xc3\xa9sir proposed that they should have lunch. They agreed, and\r\nwent into the inn parlour, which was separated from the ball-room on\r\nweekdays by a movable partition. When they had finished their omelette\r\nand cheese, the engine-man proposed to depart, and as the other tried\r\nto detain him:\r\n\r\n"What for? To listen to you talking useless foolery? I\'ve seen enough\r\nof it. Good day."\r\n\r\nHe went off in his gentle, obstinate way, with a cigarette between his\r\nlips.\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne\'s anxiety increased. It was one o\'clock, and Pluchart was\r\ndecidedly breaking his promise. Towards half-past one the delegates\r\nbegan to appear, and he had to receive them, for he wished to see\r\nwho entered, for fear that the Company might send its usual spies.\r\nHe examined every letter of invitation, and took note of those who\r\nentered; many came in without a letter, as they were admitted provided\r\nhe knew them. As two o\'clock struck Rasseneur entered, finishing\r\nhis pipe at the counter, and chatting without haste. This provoking\r\ncalmness still further disturbed \xc3\x89tienne, all the more as many had come\r\nmerely for fun--Zacharie, Mouquet, and others. These cared little about\r\nthe strike, and found it a great joke to do nothing. Seated at tables,\r\nand spending their last two sous on drink, they grinned and bantered\r\ntheir mates, the serious ones, who had come to make fools of themselves.\r\n\r\nAnother quarter of an hour passed; there was impatience in the hall.\r\nThen \xc3\x89tienne, in despair, made a gesture of resolution. And he decided\r\nto enter, when Widow D\xc3\xa9sir, who was putting her head outside, exclaimed:\r\n\r\n"But here he is, your gentleman!"\r\n\r\nIt was, in fact, Pluchart. He came in a cab drawn by a broken-winded\r\nhorse. He jumped at once on to the pavement, a thin, insipidly handsome\r\nman, with a large square head;--in his black cloth frock-coat he had\r\nthe Sunday air of a well-to-do workman. For five years he had not done\r\na stroke with the file, and he took care of his appearance, especially\r\ncombing his hair in a correct manner, vain of his successes on the\r\nplatform; but his limbs were still stiff, and the nails of his large\r\nhands, eaten by the iron, had not grown again. Very active, he worked\r\nout his ambitions, scouring the province unceasingly in order to place\r\nhis ideas.\r\n\r\n"Ah! don\'t be angry with me," he said, anticipating questions and\r\nreproaches. "Yesterday, lecture at Preuilly in the morning, meeting in\r\nthe evening at Valencay. Today, lunch at Marchiennes with Sauvagnat.\r\nThen I had to take a cab. I\'m worn out; you can tell by my voice. But\r\nthat\'s nothing; I shall speak all the same."\r\n\r\nHe was on the threshold of the Bon-Joyeux, when he bethought himself.\r\n\r\n"By jingo! I\'m forgetting the tickets. We should have been in a fine\r\nfix!"\r\n\r\nHe went back to the cab, which the cabman drew up again, and he pulled\r\nout a little black wooden box, which he carried off under his arm.\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne walked radiantly in his shadow, while Rasseneur, in\r\nconsternation, did not dare to offer his hand. But the other was\r\nalready pressing it, and saying a rapid word or two about the letter.\r\nWhat a rum idea! Why not hold this meeting? One should always hold a\r\nmeeting when possible. Widow D\xc3\xa9sir asked if he would take anything,\r\nbut he refused. No need; he spoke without drinking. Only he was in\r\na hurry, because in the evening he reckoned on pushing as far as\r\nJoiselle, where he wished to come to an understanding with Legoujeux.\r\nThen they all entered the ball-room together. Maheu and Levaque, who\r\nhad arrived late, followed them. The door was then locked, in order to\r\nbe in privacy. This made the jokers laugh even more, Zacharie shouting\r\nto Mouquet that perhaps they were going to get them all with child in\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nAbout a hundred miners were waiting on the benches in the close air of\r\nthe room, with the warm odours of the last ball rising from the floor.\r\nWhispers ran round and all heads turned, while the new-comers sat down\r\nin the empty places. They gazed at the Lille gentleman, and the black\r\nfrock-coat caused a certain surprise and discomfort.\r\n\r\nBut on \xc3\x89tienne\'s proposition the meeting was at once constituted. He\r\ngave out the names, while the others approved by lifting their hands.\r\nPluchart was nominated chairman, and Maheu and \xc3\x89tienne himself were\r\nvoted stewards. There was a movement of chairs and the officers were\r\ninstalled; for a moment they watched the chairman disappear beneath the\r\ntable under which he slid the box, which he had not let go. When he\r\nreappeared he struck lightly with his fist to call for attention; then\r\nhe began in a hoarse voice:\r\n\r\n"Citizens!"\r\n\r\nA little door opened and he had to stop. It was Widow D\xc3\xa9sir who, coming\r\nround by the kitchen, brought in six glasses on a tray.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t put yourselves out," she said. "When one talks one gets thirsty."\r\n\r\nMaheu relieved her of the tray and Pluchart was able to go on. He said\r\nhow very touched he was at his reception by the Montsou workers, he\r\nexcused himself for his delay, mentioning his fatigue and his sore\r\nthroat, then he gave place to Citizen Rasseneur, who wished to speak.\r\n\r\nRasseneur had already planted himself beside the table near the\r\nglasses. The back of a chair served him as a rostrum. He seemed very\r\nmoved, and coughed before starting in a loud voice:\r\n\r\n"Mates!"\r\n\r\nWhat gave him his influence over the workers at the pit was the\r\nfacility of his speech, the good-natured way in which he could go\r\non talking to them by the hour without ever growing weary. He never\r\nventured to gesticulate, but stood stolid and smiling, drowning them\r\nand dazing them, until they all shouted: "Yes, yes, that\'s true enough,\r\nyou\'re right!" However, on this day, from the first word, he felt that\r\nthere was a sullen opposition. This made him advance prudently. He\r\nonly discussed the continuation of the strike, and waited for applause\r\nbefore attacking the International. Certainly honour prevented them\r\nfrom yielding to the Company\'s demands; but how much misery! what\r\na terrible future if it was necessary to persist much longer! and\r\nwithout declaring for submission he damped their courage, he showed\r\nthem the settlements dying of hunger, he asked on what resources the\r\npartisans of resistance were counting. Three or four friends tried to\r\napplaud him, but this accentuated the cold silence of the majority,\r\nand the gradually rising disapprobation which greeted his phrases.\r\nThen, despairing of winning them over, he was carried away by anger,\r\nhe foretold misfortune if they allowed their heads to be turned at\r\nthe instigation of strangers. Two-thirds of the audience had risen\r\nindignantly, trying to silence him, since he insulted them by treating\r\nthem like children unable to act for themselves. But he went on\r\nspeaking in spite of the tumult, taking repeated gulps of beer, and\r\nshouting violently that the man was not born who would prevent him from\r\ndoing his duty.\r\n\r\nPluchart had risen. As he had no bell he struck his fist on the table,\r\nrepeating in his hoarse voice:\r\n\r\n"Citizens, citizens!"\r\n\r\nAt last he obtained a little quiet and the meeting, when consulted,\r\nbrought Rasseneur\'s speech to an end. The delegates who had represented\r\nthe pits in the interview with the manager led the others, all enraged\r\nby starvation and agitated by new ideas. The voting was decided in\r\nadvance.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t care a damn, you don\'t! you can eat!" yelled Levaque,\r\nthrusting out his fist at Rasseneur.\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne leaned over behind the chairman\'s back to appease Maheu, who\r\nwas very red, and carried out of himself by this hypocritical discourse.\r\n\r\n"Citizens!" said Pluchart, "allow me to speak!"\r\n\r\nThere was deep silence. He spoke. His voice sounded painful and hoarse;\r\nbut he was used to it on his journeys, and took his laryngitis about\r\nwith him like his programme. Gradually his voice expanded and he\r\nproduced pathetic effects with it. With open arms and accompanying his\r\nperiods with a swaying of his shoulders, he had an eloquence which\r\nrecalled the pulpit, a religious fashion of sinking the ends of his\r\nsentences whose monotonous roll at last carried conviction.\r\n\r\nHis discourse centred on the greatness and the advantages of the\r\nInternational; it was that with which he always started in every new\r\nlocality. He explained its aim, the emancipation of the workers; he\r\nshowed its imposing structure--below the commune, higher the province,\r\nstill higher the nation, and at the summit humanity. His arms moved\r\nslowly, piling up the stages, preparing the immense cathedral of the\r\nfuture world. Then there was the internal administration: he read the\r\nstatutes, spoke of the congresses, pointed out the growing importance\r\nof the work, the enlargement of the programme, which, starting from the\r\ndiscussion of wages, was now working towards a social liquidation, to\r\nhave done with the wage system. No more nationalities. The workers of\r\nthe whole world would be united by a common need for justice, sweeping\r\naway the middle-class corruption, founding, at last, a free society,\r\nin which he who did not work should not reap! He roared; his breath\r\nstartled the flowers of painted paper beneath the low smoky ceiling\r\nwhich sent back the sound of his voice.\r\n\r\nA wave passed through the audience. Some of them cried:\r\n\r\n"That\'s it! We\'re with you."\r\n\r\nHe went on. The world would be conquered before three years. And he\r\nenumerated the nations already conquered. From all sides adhesions were\r\nraining in. Never had a young religion counted so many disciples. Then,\r\nwhen they had the upper hand they would dictate terms to the masters,\r\nwho, in their turn, would have a fist at their throats.\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes! they\'ll have to go down!"\r\n\r\nWith a gesture he enforced silence. Now he was entering on the strike\r\nquestion. In principle he disapproved of strikes; it was a slow method,\r\nwhich aggravated the sufferings of the worker. But before better things\r\narrived, and when they were inevitable, one must make up one\'s mind\r\nto them, for they had the advantage of disorganizing capital. And in\r\nthis case he showed the International as providence for strikers, and\r\nquoted examples: in Paris, during the strike of the bronze-workers, the\r\nmasters had granted everything at once, terrified at the news that the\r\nInternational was sending help; in London it had saved the miners at a\r\ncolliery, by sending back, at its own expense, a ship-load of Belgians\r\nwho had been brought over by the coal-owner. It was sufficient to join\r\nand the companies trembled, for the men entered the great army of\r\nworkers who were resolved to die for one another rather than to remain\r\nthe slaves of a capitalistic society.\r\n\r\nApplause interrupted him. He wiped his forehead with his handkerchief,\r\nat the same time refusing a glass which Maheu passed to him. When he\r\nwas about to continue fresh applause cut short his speech.\r\n\r\n"It\'s all right," he said rapidly to \xc3\x89tienne. "They\'ve had enough.\r\nQuick! the cards!"\r\n\r\nHe had plunged beneath the table, and reappeared with the little black\r\nwooden box.\r\n\r\n"Citizens!" he shouted, dominating the disturbance, "here are the cards\r\nof membership. Let your delegates come up, and I will give them to them\r\nto be distributed. Later on we can arrange everything."\r\n\r\nRasseneur rushed forward and again protested. \xc3\x89tienne was also\r\nagitated; having to make a speech. Extreme confusion followed. Levaque\r\njumped up with his fists out, as if to fight. Maheu was up and\r\nspeaking, but nobody could distinguish a single word. In the growing\r\ntumult the dust rose from the floor, a floating dust of former balls,\r\npoisoning the air with a strong odour of putters and trammers.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the little door opened, and Widow D\xc3\xa9sir filled it with her\r\nbelly and breast, shouting in a thundering voice:\r\n\r\n"For God\'s sake, silence! The gendarmes!"\r\n\r\nIt was the commissioner of the district, who had arrived rather late\r\nto prepare a report and to break up the meeting. Four gendarmes\r\naccompanied him. For five minutes the widow had delayed them at the\r\ndoor, replying that she was at home, and that she had a perfect right\r\nto entertain her friends. But they had hustled her away, and she had\r\nrushed in to warn her children.\r\n\r\n"Must clear out through here," she said again. "There\'s a dirty\r\ngendarme guarding the court. It doesn\'t matter; my little wood-house\r\nopens into the alley. Quick, then!" The commissioner was already\r\nknocking with his fist, and as the door was not opened, he threatened\r\nto force it. A spy must have talked, for he cried that the meeting was\r\nillegal, a large number of miners being there without any letter of\r\ninvitation.\r\n\r\nIn the hall the trouble was growing. They could not escape thus; they\r\nhad not even voted either for adhesion or for the continuation of the\r\nstrike. All persisted in talking at the same time. At last the chairman\r\nsuggested a vote by acclamation. Arms were raised, and the delegates\r\ndeclared hastily that they would join in the name of their absent\r\nmates. And it was thus that the ten thousand colliers of Montsou became\r\nmembers of the International. Meanwhile, the retreat began. In order to\r\ncover it, Widow D\xc3\xa9sir had propped herself up against the door, which\r\nthe butt-ends of the gendarmes\' muskets were forcing at her back. The\r\nminers jumped over the benches, and escaped, one by one, through the\r\nkitchen and the wood-yard. Rasseneur disappeared among the first, and\r\nLevaque followed him, forgetful of his abuse, and planning how he could\r\nget an offer of a glass to pull himself together. \xc3\x89tienne, after having\r\nseized the little box, waited with Pluchart and Maheu, who considered\r\nit a point of honour to emerge last. As they disappeared the lock gave,\r\nand the commissioner found himself in the presence of the widow, whose\r\nbreast and belly still formed a barricade.\r\n\r\n"It doesn\'t help you much to smash everything in my house," she said.\r\n"You can see there\'s nobody here."\r\n\r\nThe commissioner, a slow man who did not care for scenes, simply\r\nthreatened to take her off to prison. And he then went away with his\r\nfour gendarmes to prepare a report, beneath the jeers of Zacharie and\r\nMouquet, who were full of admiration for the way in which their mates\r\nhad humbugged this armed force, for which they themselves did not care\r\na hang.\r\n\r\nIn the alley outside, \xc3\x89tienne, embarrassed by the box, was rushing\r\nalong, followed by the others. He suddenly thought of Pierron, and\r\nasked why he had not turned up. Maheu, also running, replied that he\r\nwas ill--a convenient illness, the fear of compromising himself. They\r\nwished to retain Pluchart, but, without stopping, he declared that\r\nhe must set out at once for Joiselle, where Legoujeux was awaiting\r\norders. Then, as they ran, they shouted out to him their wishes for a\r\npleasant journey, and rushed through Montsou with their heels in the\r\nair. A few words were exchanged, broken by the panting of their chests.\r\n\xc3\x89tienne and Maheu were laughing confidently, henceforth certain of\r\nvictory. When the International had sent help, it would be the Company\r\nthat would beg them to resume work. And in this burst of hope, in\r\nthis gallop of big boots sounding over the pavement of the streets,\r\nthere was something else also, something sombre and fierce, a gust of\r\nviolence which would inflame the settlements in the four corners of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother fortnight had passed by. It was the beginning of January and\r\ncold mists benumbed the immense plain. The misery had grown still\r\ngreater, and the settlements were in agony from hour to hour beneath\r\nthe increasing famine. Four thousand francs sent by the International\r\nfrom London had scarcely supplied bread for three days, and then\r\nnothing had come. This great dead hope was beating down their courage.\r\nOn what were they to count now since even their brothers had abandoned\r\nthem? They felt themselves separated from the world and lost in the\r\nmidst of this deep winter.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday no resources were left in the Deux-Cent-Quarante\r\nsettlement. \xc3\x89tienne and the delegates had multiplied their energies.\r\nNew subscriptions were opened in the neighbouring towns, and even in\r\nParis; collections were made and lectures organized. These efforts\r\ncame to nothing. Public opinion, which had at first been moved, grew\r\nindifferent now that the strike dragged on for ever, and so quietly,\r\nwithout any dramatic incidents. Small charities scarcely sufficed to\r\nmaintain the poorer families. The others lived by pawning their clothes\r\nand selling up the household piece by piece. Everything went to the\r\nbrokers, the wool of the mattresses, the kitchen utensils, even the\r\nfurniture. For a moment they thought themselves saved, for the small\r\nretail shopkeepers of Montsou, killed out by Maigrat, had offered\r\ncredit to try and get back their custom; and for a week Verdonck, the\r\ngrocer, and the two bakers, Carouble and Smelten, kept open shop, but\r\nwhen their advances were exhausted all three stopped. The bailiffs\r\nwere rejoicing; there only resulted a piling up of debts which would\r\nfor a long time weigh upon the miners. There was no more credit to be\r\nhad anywhere and not an old saucepan to sell; they might lie down in a\r\ncorner to die like mangy dogs.\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne would have sold his flesh. He had given up his salary and had\r\ngone to Marchiennes to pawn his trousers and cloth coat, happy to set\r\nthe Maheus\' pot boiling once more. His boots alone remained, and he\r\nretained these to keep a firm foothold, he said. His grief was that\r\nthe strike had come on too early, before the Provident Fund had had\r\ntime to swell. He regarded this as the only cause of the disaster, for\r\nthe workers would surely triumph over the masters on the day when they\r\nhad saved enough money to resist. And he recalled Souvarine\'s words\r\naccusing the Company of pushing forward the strike to destroy the fund\r\nat the beginning.\r\n\r\nThe sight of the settlement and of these poor people without bread or\r\nfire overcame him. He preferred to go out and to weary himself with\r\ndistant walks. One evening, as he was coming back and passing near\r\nR\xc3\xa9quillart, he perceived an old woman who had fainted by the roadside.\r\nNo doubt she was dying of hunger; and having raised her he began to\r\nshout to a girl whom he saw on the other side of the paling.\r\n\r\n"Why! is it you?" he said, recognizing Mouquette. "Come and help me\r\nthen, we must give her something to drink."\r\n\r\nMouquette, moved to tears, quickly went into the shaky hovel which her\r\nfather had set up in the midst of the ruins. She came back at once with\r\ngin and a loaf. The gin revived the old woman, who without speaking bit\r\ngreedily into the bread. She was the mother of a miner who lived at a\r\nsettlement on the Cougny side, and she had fallen there on returning\r\nfrom Joiselle, where she had in vain attempted to borrow half a franc\r\nfrom a sister. When she had eaten she went away dazed.\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne stood in the open field of R\xc3\xa9quillart, where the crumbling\r\nsheds were disappearing beneath the brambles.\r\n\r\n"Well, won\'t you come in and drink a little glass?" asked Mouquette\r\nmerrily.\r\n\r\nAnd as he hesitated:\r\n\r\n"Then you\'re still afraid of me?"\r\n\r\nHe followed her, won by her laughter. This bread, which she had given\r\nso willingly, moved him. She would not take him into her father\'s room,\r\nbut led him into her own room, where she at once poured out two little\r\nglasses of gin. The room was very neat and he complimented her on it.\r\nBesides, the family seemed to want for nothing; the father continued\r\nhis duties as a groom at the Voreux while she, saying that she could\r\nnot live with folded arms, had become a laundress, which brought her in\r\nthirty sous a day. One may amuse oneself with men but one isn\'t lazy\r\nfor all that.\r\n\r\n"I say," she murmured, all at once coming and putting her arms round\r\nhim prettily, "why don\'t you like me?"\r\n\r\nHe could not help laughing, she had done this in so charming a way.\r\n\r\n"But I like you very much," he replied.\r\n\r\n"No, no, not like I mean. You know that I am dying of longing. Come, it\r\nwould give me so much pleasure."\r\n\r\nIt was true, she had desired him for six months. He still looked at her\r\nas she clung to him, pressing him with her two tremulous arms, her face\r\nraised with such supplicating love that he was deeply moved. There was\r\nnothing beautiful in her large round face, with its yellow complexion\r\neaten by the coal; but her eyes shone with flame, a charm rose from\r\nher skin, a trembling of desire which made her rosy and young. In face\r\nof this gift which was so humble and so ardent he no longer dared to\r\nrefuse.\r\n\r\n"Oh! you are willing," she stammered, delighted. "Oh! you are willing!"\r\n\r\nAnd she gave herself up with the fainting awkwardness of a virgin, as\r\nif it was for the first time, and she had never before known a man.\r\nThen when he left her, it was she who was overcome with gratitude; she\r\nthanked him and kissed his hands.\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne remained rather ashamed of this good fortune. Nobody boasted\r\nof having had Mouquette. As he went away he swore that it should not\r\noccur again, but he preserved a friendly remembrance of her; she was a\r\ncapital girl.\r\n\r\nWhen he got back to the settlement, he found serious news which made\r\nhim forget the adventure. The rumour was circulating that the Company\r\nwould, perhaps, agree to make a concession if the delegates made\r\na fresh attempt with the manager. At all events some captains had\r\nspread this rumour. The truth was, that in this struggle the mine\r\nwas suffering even more than the miners. On both sides obstinacy was\r\npiling up ruin: while labour was dying of hunger, capital was being\r\ndestroyed. Every day of rest carried away hundreds of thousands of\r\nfrancs. Every machine which stops is a dead machine. Tools and material\r\nare impaired, the money that is sunk melts away like water drunk by\r\nthe sand. Since the small stock of coal at the surface of the pits was\r\nexhausted, customers talked of going to Belgium, so that in future they\r\nwould be threatened from that quarter. But what especially frightened\r\nthe Company, although the matter was carefully concealed, was the\r\nincreasing damage to the galleries and workings. The captains could\r\nnot cope with the repairs, the timber was falling everywhere, and\r\nlandslips were constantly taking place. Soon the disasters became so\r\nserious that long months would be needed for repairs before hewing\r\ncould be resumed. Already stories were going about the country: at\r\nCr\xc3\xa9vecoeur three hundred metres of road had subsided in a mass,\r\nstopping up access to the Cinq-Paumes; at Madeleine the Maugr\xc3\xa9tout seam\r\nwas crumbling away and filling with water. The management refused to\r\nadmit this, but suddenly two accidents, one after the other, had forced\r\nthem to avow it. One morning, near Piolaine, the ground was found\r\ncracked above the north gallery of Mirou which had fallen in the day\r\nbefore; and on the following day the ground subsided within the Voreux,\r\nshaking a corner of a suburb to such an extent that two houses nearly\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne and the delegates hesitated to risk any steps without knowing\r\nthe directors\' intentions. Dansaert, whom they questioned, avoided\r\nreplying: certainly, the misunderstanding was deplored, and everything\r\nwould be done to bring about an agreement; but he could say nothing\r\ndefinitely. At last, they decided that they would go to M. Hennebeau\r\nin order to have reason on their side; for they did not wish to be\r\naccused, later on, of having refused the Company an opportunity of\r\nacknowledging that it had been in the wrong. Only they vowed to yield\r\nnothing and to maintain, in spite of everything, their terms, which\r\nwere alone just.\r\n\r\nThe interview took place on Tuesday morning, when the settlement was\r\nsinking into desperate wretchedness. It was less cordial than the\r\nfirst interview. Maheu was still the speaker, and he explained that\r\ntheir mates had sent them to ask if these gentlemen had anything new\r\nto say. At first M. Hennebeau affected surprise: no order had reached\r\nhim, nothing could be changed so long as the miners persisted in their\r\ndetestable rebellion; and this official stiffness produced the worst\r\neffects, so that if the delegates had gone out of their way to offer\r\nconciliation, the way in which they were received would only have\r\nserved to make them more obstinate. Afterwards the manager tried to\r\nseek a basis of mutual concession; thus, if the men would accept the\r\nseparate payment for timbering, the Company would raise that payment\r\nby the two centimes which they were accused of profiting by. Besides,\r\nhe added that he would take the offer on himself, that nothing was\r\nsettled, but that he flattered himself he could obtain this concession\r\nfrom Paris. But the delegates refused, and repeated their demands: the\r\nretention of the old system, with a rise of five centimes a tram. Then\r\nhe acknowledged that he could treat with them at once, and urged them\r\nto accept in the name of their wives and little ones dying of hunger.\r\nAnd with eyes on the ground and stiff heads they said no, always no,\r\nwith fierce vigour. They separated curtly. M. Hennebeau banged the\r\ndoors. \xc3\x89tienne, Maheu, and the others went off stamping with their\r\ngreat heels on the pavement in the mute rage of the vanquished pushed\r\nto extremes.\r\n\r\nTowards two o\'clock the women of the settlement, on their side, made\r\nan application to Maigrat. There was only this hope left, to bend this\r\nman and to wrench from him another week\'s credit. The idea originated\r\nwith Maheude, who often counted too much on people\'s good-nature. She\r\npersuaded the Brul\xc3\xa9 and the Levaque to accompany her; as to Pierronne,\r\nshe excused herself, saying that she could not leave Pierron, whose\r\nillness still continued. Other women joined the band till they numbered\r\nquite twenty. When the inhabitants of Montsou saw them arrive, gloomy\r\nand wretched, occupying the whole width of the road, they shook their\r\nheads anxiously. Doors were closed, and one lady hid her plate. It was\r\nthe first time they had been seen thus, and there could not be a worse\r\nsign: usually everything was going to ruin when the women thus took to\r\nthe roads. At Maigrat\'s there was a violent scene. At first, he had\r\nmade them go in, jeering and pretending to believe that they had come\r\nto pay their debts: that was nice of them to have agreed to come and\r\nbring the money all at once. Then, as soon as Maheude began to speak he\r\npretended to be enraged. Were they making fun of people? More credit!\r\nThen they wanted to turn him into the street? No, not a single potato,\r\nnot a single crumb of bread! And he told them to be off to the grocer\r\nVerdonck, and to the bakers Carouble and Smelten, since they now dealt\r\nwith them. The women listened with timid humility, apologizing, and\r\nwatching his eyes to see if he would relent. He began to joke, offering\r\nhis shop to the Brul\xc3\xa9 if she would have him as a lover. They were all\r\nso cowardly that they laughed at this; and the Levaque improved on it,\r\ndeclaring that she was willing, she was. But he at once became abusive,\r\nand pushed them towards the door. As they insisted, suppliantly, he\r\ntreated one brutally. The others on the pavement shouted that he had\r\nsold himself to the Company, while Maheude, with her arms in the air,\r\nin a burst of avenging indignation, cried out for his death, exclaiming\r\nthat such a man did not deserve to eat.\r\n\r\nThe return to the settlement was melancholy. When the women came back\r\nwith empty hands, the men looked at them and then lowered their heads.\r\nThere was nothing more to be done, the day would end without a spoonful\r\nof soup; and the other days extended in an icy shadow, without a ray\r\nof hope. They had made up their minds to it, and no one spoke of\r\nsurrender. This excess of misery made them still more obstinate, mute\r\nas tracked beasts, resolved to die at the bottom of their hole rather\r\nthan come out. Who would dare to be first to speak of submission?\r\nThey had sworn with their mates to hold together, and hold together\r\nthey would, as they held together at the pit when one of them was\r\nbeneath a landslip. It was as it ought to be; it was a good school\r\nfor resignation down there. They might well tighten their belts for\r\na week, when they had been swallowing fire and water ever since they\r\nwere twelve years of age; and their devotion was thus augmented by the\r\npride of soldiers, of men proud of their profession, who in their daily\r\nstruggle with death had gained a pride in sacrifice.\r\n\r\nWith the Maheus it was a terrible evening. They were all silent, seated\r\nbefore the dying fire in which the last cinders were smoking. After\r\nhaving emptied the mattresses, handful by handful, they had decided\r\nthe day before to sell the clock for three francs and the room seemed\r\nbare and dead now that the familiar tick-tack no longer filled it with\r\nsound. The only object of luxury now, in the middle of the sideboard,\r\nwas the rose cardboard box, an old present from Maheu, which Maheude\r\ntreasured like a jewel. The two good chairs had gone; Father Bonnemort\r\nand the children were squeezed together on an old mossy bench brought\r\nin from the garden. And the livid twilight now coming on seemed to\r\nincrease the cold.\r\n\r\n"What\'s to be done?" repeated Maheude, crouching down in the corner by\r\nthe oven.\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne stood up, looking at the portraits of the Emperor and Empress\r\nstuck against the wall. He would have torn them down long since if\r\nthe family had not preserved them for ornament. So he murmured, with\r\nclenched teeth:\r\n\r\n"And to think that we can\'t get two sous out of these damned idiots,\r\nwho are watching us starve!"\r\n\r\n"If I were to take the box?" said the woman, very pale, after some\r\nhesitation.\r\n\r\nMaheu, seated on the edge of the table, with his legs dangling and his\r\nhead on his chest, sat up.\r\n\r\n"No! I won\'t have it!"\r\n\r\nMaheude painfully rose and walked round the room. Good God! was it\r\npossible that they were reduced to such misery? The cupboard without\r\na crumb, nothing more to sell, no notion where to get a loaf! And the\r\nfire, which was nearly out! She became angry with Alzire, whom she had\r\nsent in the morning to glean on the pit-bank, and who had come back\r\nwith empty hands, saying that the Company would not allow gleaning. Did\r\nit matter a hang what the Company wanted? As if they were robbing any\r\none by picking up the bits of lost coal! The little girl, in despair,\r\ntold how a man had threatened to hit her; then she promised to go back\r\nnext day, even if she was beaten.\r\n\r\n"And that imp, Jeanlin," cried the mother; "where is he now, I should\r\nlike to know? He ought to have brought the salad; we can browse on\r\nthat like beasts, at all events! You will see, he won\'t come back.\r\nYesterday, too, he slept out. I don\'t know what he\'s up to; the rascal\r\nalways looks as though his belly were full."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps," said \xc3\x89tienne, "he picks up sous on the road."\r\n\r\nShe suddenly lifted both fists furiously.\r\n\r\n"If I knew that! My children beg! I\'d rather kill them and myself too."\r\n\r\nMaheu had again sunk down on the edge of the table. L\xc3\xa9nore and Henri,\r\nastonished that they had nothing to eat, began to moan; while old\r\nBonnemort, in silence, philosophically rolled his tongue in his mouth\r\nto deceive his hunger. No one spoke any more; all were becoming\r\nbenumbed beneath this aggravation of their evils; the grandfather,\r\ncoughing and spitting out the black phlegm, taken again by rheumatism\r\nwhich was turning to dropsy; the father asthmatic, and with knees\r\nswollen with water; the mother and the little ones scarred by scrofula\r\nand hereditary anaemia. No doubt their work made this inevitable; they\r\nonly complained when the lack of food killed them off; and already they\r\nwere falling like flies in the settlement. But something must be found\r\nfor supper. My God! where was it to be found, what was to be done?\r\n\r\nThen, in the twilight, which made the room more and more gloomy with\r\nits dark melancholy, \xc3\x89tienne, who had been hesitating for a moment, at\r\nlast decided with aching heart.\r\n\r\n"Wait for me," he said. "I\'ll go and see somewhere."\r\n\r\nAnd he went out. The idea of Mouquette had occurred to him. She would\r\ncertainly have a loaf, and would give it willingly. It annoyed him to\r\nbe thus forced to return to R\xc3\xa9quillart; this girl would kiss his hands\r\nwith her air of an amorous servant; but one did not leave one\'s friends\r\nin trouble; he would still be kind with her if need be.\r\n\r\n"I will go and look round, too," said Maheude, in her turn. "It\'s too\r\nstupid."\r\n\r\nShe reopened the door after the young man and closed it violently,\r\nleaving the others motionless and mute in the faint light of a\r\ncandle-end which Alzire had just lighted. Outside she stopped and\r\nthought for a moment. Then she entered the Levaque\'s house.\r\n\r\n"Tell me: I lent you a loaf the other day. Could you give it me back?"\r\n\r\nBut she stopped herself. What she saw was far from encouraging; the\r\nhouse spoke of misery even more than her own.\r\n\r\nThe Levaque woman, with fixed eyes, was gazing into her burnt-out fire,\r\nwhile Levaque, made drunk on his empty stomach by some nail-makers,\r\nwas sleeping on the table. With his back to the wall, Bouteloup was\r\nmechanically rubbing his shoulders with the amazement of a good-natured\r\nfellow who has eaten up his savings, and is astonished at having to\r\ntighten his belt.\r\n\r\n"A loaf! ah! my dear," replied the Levaque woman, "I wanted to borrow\r\nanother from you!"\r\n\r\nThen, as her husband groaned with pain in his sleep, she pushed his\r\nface against the table.\r\n\r\n"Hold your row, bloody beast! So much the better if it burns your guts!\r\nInstead of getting people to pay for your drinks, you ought to have\r\nasked twenty sous from a friend."\r\n\r\nShe went on relieving herself by swearing, in the midst of this dirty\r\nhousehold, already abandoned so long that an unbearable smell was\r\nexhaling from the floor. Everything might smash up, she didn\'t care a\r\nhang! Her son, that rascal B\xc3\xa9bert, had also disappeared since morning,\r\nand she shouted that it would be a good riddance if he never came back.\r\nThen she said that she would go to bed. At least she could get warm.\r\nShe hustled Bouteloup.\r\n\r\n"Come along, up we go. The fire\'s out. No need to light the candle to\r\nsee the empty plates. Well, are you coming, Louis? I tell you that we\r\nmust go to bed. We can cuddle up together there, that\'s a comfort. And\r\nlet this damned drunkard die here of cold by himself!"\r\n\r\nWhen she found herself outside again, Maheude struck resolutely across\r\nthe gardens towards Pierron\'s house. She heard laughter. As she knocked\r\nthere was sudden silence. It was a full minute before the door was\r\nopened.\r\n\r\n"What! is it you?" exclaimed Pierronne with affected surprise. "I\r\nthought it was the doctor."\r\n\r\nWithout allowing her to speak, she went on, pointing to Pierron, who\r\nwas seated before a large coal fire:\r\n\r\n"Ah! he makes no progress, he makes no progress at all. His face looks\r\nall right; it\'s in his belly that it takes him. Then he must have\r\nwarmth. We burn all that we\'ve got."\r\n\r\nPierron, in fact, looked very well; his complexion was good and his\r\nflesh fat. It was in vain that he breathed hard in order to play the\r\nsick man. Besides, as Maheude came in she perceived a strong smell\r\nof rabbit; they had certainly put the dish out of the way. There\r\nwere crumbs strewed over the table, and in the very midst she saw a\r\nforgotten bottle of wine.\r\n\r\n"Mother has gone to Montsou to try and get a loaf," said Pierronne\r\nagain. "We are cooling our heels waiting for her."\r\n\r\nBut her voice choked; she had followed her neighbour\'s glance, and\r\nher eyes also fell on the bottle. Immediately she began again, and\r\nnarrated the story. Yes, it was wine; the Piolaine people had brought\r\nher that bottle for her man, who had been ordered by the doctor to take\r\nclaret. And her thankfulness poured forth in a stream. What good people\r\nthey were! The young lady especially; she was not proud, going into\r\nworkpeople\'s houses and distributing her charities herself.\r\n\r\n"I see," said Maheude; "I know them."\r\n\r\nHer heart ached at the idea that the good things always go to the least\r\npoor. It was always so, and these Piolaine people had carried water to\r\nthe river. Why had she not seen them in the settlement? Perhaps, all\r\nthe same, she might have got something out of them.\r\n\r\n"I came," she confessed at last, "to know if there was more going with\r\nyou than with us. Have you just a little vermicelli by way of loan?"\r\n\r\nPierronne expressed her grief noisily.\r\n\r\n"Nothing at all, my dear. Not what you can call a grain of semolina. If\r\nmother hasn\'t come back, it\'s because she hasn\'t succeeded. We must go\r\nto bed supperless."\r\n\r\nAt this moment crying was heard from the cellar, and she grew angry and\r\nstruck her fist against the door. It was that gadabout Lydie, whom she\r\nhad shut up, she said, to punish her for not having returned until five\r\no\'clock, after having been roaming about the whole day. One could no\r\nlonger keep her in order; she was constantly disappearing.\r\n\r\nMaheude, however, remained standing; she could not make up her mind to\r\nleave. This large fire filled her with a painful sensation of comfort;\r\nthe thought that they were eating there enlarged the void in her\r\nstomach. Evidently they had sent away the old woman and shut up the\r\nchild, to blow themselves out with their rabbit. Ah! whatever people\r\nmight say, when a woman behaved ill, that brought luck to her house.\r\n\r\n"Good night," she said, suddenly.\r\n\r\nOutside night had come on, and the moon behind the clouds was lighting\r\nup the earth with a dubious glow. Instead of traversing the gardens\r\nagain, Maheude went round, despairing, afraid to go home again.\r\nBut along the dead frontages all the doors smelled of famine and\r\nsounded hollow. What was the good of knocking? There was wretchedness\r\neverywhere. For weeks since they had had nothing to eat. Even the odour\r\nof onion had gone, that strong odour which revealed the settlement from\r\nafar across the country; now there was nothing but the smell of old\r\nvaults, the dampness of holes in which nothing lives. Vague sounds were\r\ndying out, stifled tears, lost oaths; and in the silence which slowly\r\ngrew heavier one could hear the sleep of hunger coming on, the collapse\r\nof bodies thrown across beds in the nightmares of empty bellies.\r\n\r\nAs she passed before the church she saw a shadow slip rapidly by. A\r\ngleam of hope made her hasten, for she had recognized the Montsou\r\npriest, Abb\xc3\xa9 Joire, who said mass on Sundays at the settlement chapel.\r\nNo doubt he had just come out of the sacristy, where he had been called\r\nto settle some affair. With rounded back he moved quickly on, a fat\r\nmeek man, anxious to live at peace with everybody. If he had come at\r\nnight it must have been in order not to compromise himself among the\r\nminers. It was said, too, that he had just obtained promotion. He had\r\neven been seen walking about with his successor, a lean man, with eyes\r\nlike live coals.\r\n\r\n"Sir, sir!" stammered Maheude.\r\n\r\nBut he would not stop.\r\n\r\n"Good night, good night, my good woman."\r\n\r\nShe found herself before her own door. Her legs would no longer carry\r\nher, and she went in.\r\n\r\nNo one had stirred. Maheu still sat dejected on the edge of the table.\r\nOld Bonnemort and the little ones were huddled together on the bench\r\nfor the sake of warmth. And they had not said a word, and the candle\r\nhad burnt so low that even light would soon fail them. At the sound of\r\nthe door the children turned their heads; but seeing that their mother\r\nbrought nothing back, they looked down on the ground again, repressing\r\nthe longing to cry, for fear of being scolded. Maheude fell back into\r\nher place near the dying fire. They asked her no questions, and the\r\nsilence continued. All had understood, and they thought it useless to\r\nweary themselves more by talking; they were now waiting, despairing and\r\nwithout courage, in the last expectation that perhaps \xc3\x89tienne would\r\nunearth help somewhere. The minutes went by, and at last they no longer\r\nreckoned on this.\r\n\r\nWhen \xc3\x89tienne reappeared, he held a cloth containing a dozen potatoes,\r\ncooked but cold.\r\n\r\n"That\'s all that I\'ve found," he said.\r\n\r\nWith Mouquette also bread was wanting; it was her dinner which she had\r\nforced him to take in this cloth, kissing him with all her heart.\r\n\r\n"Thanks," he said to Maheude, who offered him his share; "I\'ve eaten\r\nover there."\r\n\r\nIt was not true, and he gloomily watched the children throw themselves\r\non the food. The father and mother also restrained themselves, in order\r\nto leave more; but the old man greedily swallowed everything. They had\r\nto take a potato away from him for Alzire.\r\n\r\nThen \xc3\x89tienne said that he had heard news. The Company, irritated by the\r\nobstinacy of the strikers, talked of giving back their certificates\r\nto the compromised miners. Certainly, the Company was for war. And a\r\nmore serious rumour circulated: they boasted of having persuaded a\r\nlarge number of men to go down again. On the next day the Victoire and\r\nFeutry-Cantel would be complete; even at Madeleine and Mirou there\r\nwould be a third of the men. The Maheus were furious.\r\n\r\n"By God!" shouted the father, "if there are traitors, we must settle\r\ntheir account."\r\n\r\nAnd standing up, yielding to the fury of his suffering:\r\n\r\n"To-morrow evening, to the forest! Since they won\'t let us come to an\r\nunderstanding at the Bon-Joyeux, we can be at home in the forest!"\r\n\r\nThis cry had aroused old Bonnemort, who had grown drowsy after his\r\ngluttony. It was the old rallying-cry, the rendezvous where the miners\r\nof old days used to plot their resistance to the king\'s soldiers.\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, to Vandame! I\'m with you if you go there!"\r\n\r\nMaheude made an energetic gesture.\r\n\r\n"We will all go. That will finish these injustices and treacheries."\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne decided that the rendezvous should be announced to all the\r\nsettlements for the following evening. But the fire was dead, as with\r\nthe Levaques, and the candle suddenly went out. There was no more coal\r\nand no more oil; they had to feel their way to bed in the intense cold\r\nwhich contracted the skin. The little ones were crying.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\nJeanlin was now well and able to walk; but his legs had united so badly\r\nthat he limped on both the right and left sides, and moved with the\r\ngait of a duck, though running as fast as formerly with the skill of a\r\nmischievous and thieving animal.\r\n\r\nOn this evening, in the dusk on the R\xc3\xa9quillart road, Jeanlin,\r\naccompanied by his inseparable friends, B\xc3\xa9bert and Lydie, was on the\r\nwatch. He had taken ambush in a vacant space, behind a paling opposite\r\nan obscure grocery shop, situated at the corner of a lane. An old woman\r\nwho was nearly blind displayed there three or four sacks of lentils\r\nand haricots, black with dust; and it was an ancient dried codfish,\r\nhanging by the door and stained with fly-blows, to which his eyes were\r\ndirected. Twice already he had sent B\xc3\xa9bert to unhook it. But each time\r\nsomeone had appeared at the bend in the road. Always intruders in the\r\nway, one could not attend to one\'s affairs.\r\n\r\nA gentleman went by on horseback, and the children flattened themselves\r\nat the bottom of the paling, for they recognized M. Hennebeau. Since\r\nthe strike he was often thus seen along the roads, riding alone amid\r\nthe rebellious settlements, ascertaining, with quiet courage, the\r\ncondition of the country. And never had a stone whistled by his ears;\r\nhe only met men who were silent and slow to salute him; most often he\r\ncame upon lovers, who cared nothing for politics and took their fill\r\nof pleasure in holes and corners. He passed by on his trotting mare\r\nwith head directed straight forward, so as to disturb nobody, while his\r\nheart was swelling with an unappeased desire amid this gormandizing of\r\nfree love. He distinctly saw these small rascals, the little boys on\r\nthe little girl in a heap. Even the youngsters were already amusing\r\nthemselves in their misery! His eyes grew moist, and he disappeared,\r\nsitting stiffly on his saddle, with his frock-coat buttoned up in a\r\nmilitary manner.\r\n\r\n"Damned luck!" said Jeanlin. "This will never finish. Go on, B\xc3\xa9bert!\r\nHang on to its tail!"\r\n\r\nBut two men once more appeared, and the child again stifled an oath\r\nwhen he heard the voice of his brother Zacharie narrating to Mouquet\r\nhow he had discovered a two-franc piece sewn into one of his wife\'s\r\npetticoats. They both grinned with satisfaction, slapping each other on\r\nthe shoulder. Mouquet proposed a game of crosse for the next day; they\r\nwould leave the Avantage at two o\'clock, and go to the Montoire side,\r\nnear Marchiennes. Zacharie agreed. What was the good of bothering over\r\nthe strike? as well amuse oneself, since there\'s nothing to do. And\r\nthey turned the corner of the road, when \xc3\x89tienne, who was coming along\r\nthe canal, stopped them and began to talk.\r\n\r\n"Are they going to bed here?" said Jeanlin, in exasperation. "Nearly\r\nnight; the old woman will be taking in her sacks."\r\n\r\nAnother miner came down towards R\xc3\xa9quillart. \xc3\x89tienne went off with him,\r\nand as they passed the paling the child heard them speak of the forest;\r\nthey had been obliged to put off the rendezvous to the following\r\nday, for fear of not being able to announce it in one day to all the\r\nsettlements.\r\n\r\n"I say, there," he whispered to his two mates, "the big affair is for\r\nto-morrow. We\'ll go, eh? We can get off in the afternoon."\r\n\r\nAnd the road being at last free, he sent B\xc3\xa9bert off.\r\n\r\n"Courage! hang on to its tail. And look out! the old woman\'s got her\r\nbroom."\r\n\r\nFortunately the night had grown dark. B\xc3\xa9bert, with a leap, hung on to\r\nthe cod so that the string broke. He ran away, waving it like a kite,\r\nfollowed by the two others, all three galloping. The woman came out\r\nof her shop in astonishment, without understanding or being able to\r\ndistinguish this band now lost in the darkness.\r\n\r\nThese scoundrels had become the terror of the country. They gradually\r\nspread themselves over it like a horde of savages. At first they had\r\nbeen satisfied with the yard at the Voreux, tumbling into the stock of\r\ncoal, from which they would emerge looking like Negroes, playing at\r\nhide-and-seek amid the supply of wood, in which they lost themselves\r\nas in the depths of a virgin forest. Then they had taken the pit-bank\r\nby assault; they would seat themselves on it and slide down the bare\r\nportions still boiling with interior fires; they glided among the\r\nbriers in the older parts, hiding for the whole day, occupied in the\r\nquiet little games of mischievous mice. And they were constantly\r\nenlarging their conquests, scuffling among the piles of bricks until\r\nblood came, running about the fields and eating without bread all sorts\r\nof milky herbs, searching the banks of the canals to take fish from the\r\nmud and swallow them raw and pushing still farther, they travelled for\r\nkilometres as far as the thickets of Vandame, under which they gorged\r\nthemselves with strawberries in the spring, with nuts and bilberries in\r\nsummer. Soon the immense plain belonged to them.\r\n\r\nWhat drove them thus from Montsou to Marchiennes, constantly on the\r\nroads with the eyes of young wolves, was the growing love of plunder.\r\nJeanlin remained the captain of these expeditions, leading the troop\r\non to all sorts of prey, ravaging the onion fields, pillaging the\r\norchards, attacking shop windows. In the country, people accused the\r\nminers on strike, and talked of a vast organized band. One day, even,\r\nhe had forced Lydie to steal from her mother, and made her bring him\r\ntwo dozen sticks of barley-sugar, which Pierronne kept in a bottle\r\non one of the boards in her window; and the little girl, who was\r\nwell beaten, had not betrayed him because she trembled so before his\r\nauthority. The worst was that he always gave himself the lion\'s share.\r\nB\xc3\xa9bert also had to bring him the booty, happy if the captain did not\r\nhit him and keep it all.\r\n\r\nFor some time Jeanlin had abused his authority. He would beat Lydie as\r\none beats one\'s lawful wife, and he profited by B\xc3\xa9bert\'s credulity to\r\nsend him on unpleasant adventures, amused at making a fool of this big\r\nboy, who was stronger than himself, and could have knocked him over\r\nwith a blow of his fist. He felt contempt for both of them and treated\r\nthem as slaves, telling them that he had a princess for his mistress\r\nand that they were unworthy to appear before her. And, in fact, during\r\nthe past week he would suddenly disappear at the end of a road or a\r\nturning in a path, no matter where it might be, after having ordered\r\nthem with a terrible air to go back to the settlement. But first he\r\nwould pocket the booty.\r\n\r\nThis was what happened on the present occasion.\r\n\r\n"Give it up," he said, snatching the cod from his mate\'s hands when\r\nthey stopped, all three, at a bend in the road near R\xc3\xa9quillart.\r\n\r\nB\xc3\xa9bert protested.\r\n\r\n"I want some, you know. I took it."\r\n\r\n"Eh! what!" he cried. "You\'ll have some if I give you some. Not\r\nto-night, sure enough; to-morrow, if there\'s any left."\r\n\r\nHe pushed Lydie, and placed both of them in line like soldiers\r\nshouldering arms. Then, passing behind them:\r\n\r\n"Now, you must stay there five minutes without turning. By God! if you\r\ndo turn, there will be beasts that will eat you up. And then you will\r\ngo straight back, and if B\xc3\xa9bert touches Lydie on the way, I shall know\r\nit and I shall hit you."\r\n\r\nThen he disappeared in the shadow, so lightly that the sound of his\r\nnaked feet could not be heard. The two children remained motionless\r\nfor the five minutes without looking round, for fear of receiving a\r\nblow from the invisible. Slowly a great affection had grown up between\r\nthem in their common terror. He was always thinking of taking her and\r\npressing her very tight between his arms, as he had seen others do and\r\nshe, too, would have liked it, for it would have been a change for\r\nher to be so nicely caressed. But neither of them would have allowed\r\nthemselves to disobey. When they went away, although the night was very\r\ndark, they did not even kiss each other; they walked side by side,\r\ntender and despairing, certain that if they touched one another the\r\ncaptain would strike them from behind.\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne, at the same hour, had entered R\xc3\xa9quillart. The evening before\r\nMouquette had begged him to return, and he returned, ashamed, feeling\r\nan inclination which he refused to acknowledge, for this girl who\r\nadored him like a Christ. It was, besides, with the intention of\r\nbreaking it off. He would see her, he would explain to her that she\r\nought no longer to pursue him, on account of the mates. It was not a\r\ntime for pleasure; it was dishonest to amuse oneself thus when people\r\nwere dying of hunger. And not having found her at home, he had decided\r\nto wait and watch the shadows of the passers-by.\r\n\r\nBeneath the ruined steeple the old shaft opened, half blocked up.\r\nAbove the black hole a beam stood erect, and with a fragment of roof\r\nat the top it had the profile of a gallows; in the broken walling of\r\nthe curbs stood two trees--a mountain ash and a plane--which seemed\r\nto grow from the depths of the earth. It was a corner of abandoned\r\nwildness, the grassy and fibrous entry of a gulf, embarrassed with old\r\nwood, planted with hawthorns and sloe-trees, which were peopled in the\r\nspring by warblers in their nests. Wishing to avoid the great expense\r\nof keeping it up, the Company, for the last ten years, had proposed to\r\nfill up this dead pit; but they were waiting to install an air-shaft\r\nin the Voreux, for the ventilation furnace of the two pits, which\r\ncommunicated, was placed at the foot of R\xc3\xa9quillart, of which the former\r\nwinding-shaft served as a conduit. They were content to consolidate the\r\ntubbing by beams placed across, preventing extraction, and they had\r\nneglected the upper galleries to watch only over the lower gallery, in\r\nwhich blazed the furnace, the enormous coal fire, with so powerful a\r\ndraught that the rush of air produced the wind of a tempest from one\r\nend to the other of the neighbouring mine. As a precaution, in order\r\nthat they could still go up and down, the order had been given to\r\nfurnish the shaft with ladders; only, as no one took charge of them,\r\nthe ladders were rotting with dampness, and in some places had already\r\ngiven way. Above, a large brier stopped the entry of the passage, and,\r\nas the first ladder had lost some rungs, it was necessary, in order to\r\nreach it, to hang on to a root of the mountain ash, and then to take\r\none\'s chance and drop into the blackness.\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne was waiting patiently, hidden behind a bush, when he heard a\r\nlong rustling among the branches. He thought at first that it was the\r\nscared flight of a snake. But the sudden gleam of a match astonished\r\nhim, and he was stupefied on recognizing Jeanlin, who was lighting a\r\ncandle and burying himself in the earth. He was seized with curiosity,\r\nand approached the hole; the child had disappeared, and a faint gleam\r\ncame from the second ladder. \xc3\x89tienne hesitated a moment, and then let\r\nhimself go, holding on to the roots. He thought for a moment that he\r\nwas about to fall down the whole five hundred and eighty metres of\r\nthe mine, but at last he felt a rung, and descended gently. Jeanlin\r\nhad evidently heard nothing. \xc3\x89tienne constantly saw the light sinking\r\nbeneath him, while the little one\'s shadow, colossal and disturbing,\r\ndanced with the deformed gait of his distorted limbs. He kicked his\r\nlegs about with the skill of a monkey, catching on with hands, feet,\r\nor chin where the rungs were wanting. Ladders, seven metres in length,\r\nfollowed one another, some still firm, others shaky, yielding and\r\nalmost broken; the steps were narrow and green, so rotten that one\r\nseemed to walk in moss; and as one went down the heat grew suffocating,\r\nthe heat of an oven proceeding from the air-shaft which was,\r\nfortunately, not very active now the strike was on, or when the furnace\r\ndevoured its five thousand kilograms of coal a day, one could not have\r\nrisked oneself here without scorching one\'s hair.\r\n\r\n"What a dammed little toad!" exclaimed \xc3\x89tienne in a stifled voice;\r\n"where the devil is he going to?"\r\n\r\nTwice he had nearly fallen. His feet slid on the damp wood. If he had\r\nonly had a candle like the child! but he struck himself every minute;\r\nhe was only guided by the vague gleam that fled beneath him. He had\r\nalready reached the twentieth ladder, and the descent still continued.\r\nThen he counted them: twenty-one, twenty-two, twenty-three, and he\r\nstill went down and down. His head seemed to be swelling with the heat,\r\nand he thought that he was falling into a furnace. At last he reached a\r\nlanding-place, and he saw the candle going off along a gallery. Thirty\r\nladders, that made about two hundred and ten metres.\r\n\r\n"Is he going to drag me about long?" he thought. "He must be going to\r\nbury himself in the stable."\r\n\r\nBut on the left, the path which led to the stable was closed by a\r\nlandslip. The journey began again, now more painful and more dangerous.\r\nFrightened bats flew about and clung to the roof of the gallery. He\r\nhad to hasten so as not to lose sight of the light; only where the\r\nchild passed with ease, with the suppleness of a serpent, he could\r\nnot glide through without bruising his limbs. This gallery, like all\r\nthe older passages, was narrow, and grew narrower every day from the\r\nconstant fall of soil; at certain places it was a mere tube which would\r\neventually be effaced. In this strangling labour the torn and broken\r\nwood became a peril, threatening to saw into his flesh, or to run him\r\nthrough with the points of splinters, sharp as swords. He could only\r\nadvance with precaution, on his knees or belly, feeling in the darkness\r\nbefore him. Suddenly a band of rats stamped over him, running from his\r\nneck to his feet in their galloping flight.\r\n\r\n"Blast it all! haven\'t we got to the end yet?" he grumbled, with aching\r\nback and out of breath.\r\n\r\nThey were there. At the end of a kilometre the tube enlarged, they\r\nreached a part of the gallery which was admirably preserved. It was\r\nthe end of the old haulage passage cut across the bed like a natural\r\ngrotto. He was obliged to stop, he saw the child afar, placing his\r\ncandle between two stones, and putting himself at ease with the quiet\r\nand relieved air of a man who is glad to be at home again. This\r\ngallery-end was completely changed into a comfortable dwelling. In\r\na corner on the ground a pile of hay made a soft couch; on some old\r\nplanks, placed like a table, there were bread, potatoes, and bottles of\r\ngin already opened; it was a real brigand\'s cavern, with booty piled up\r\nfor weeks, even useless booty like soap and blacking, stolen for the\r\npleasure of stealing. And the child, quite alone in the midst of this\r\nplunder, was enjoying it like a selfish brigand.\r\n\r\n"I say, then, is this how you make fun of people?" cried \xc3\x89tienne, when\r\nhe had breathed for a moment. "You come and gorge yourself here, when\r\nwe are dying of hunger up above?"\r\n\r\nJeanlin, astounded, was trembling. But recognizing the young man, he\r\nquickly grew calm.\r\n\r\n"Will you come and dine with me?" he said at last. "Eh? a bit of\r\ngrilled cod? You shall see."\r\n\r\nHe had not let go his cod, and he began to scrape off the fly-blows\r\nproperly with a fine new knife, one of those little dagger knives, with\r\nbone handles, on which mottoes are inscribed. This one simply bore the\r\nword "Amour."\r\n\r\n"You have a fine knife," remarked \xc3\x89tienne.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a present from Lydie," replied Jeanlin, who neglected to add\r\nthat Lydie had stolen it, by his orders, from a huckster at Montsou,\r\nstationed before the T\xc3\xaate-Coup\xc3\xa9e Bar.\r\n\r\nThen, as he still scraped, he added proudly:\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t it comfortable in my house? It\'s a bit warmer than up above, and\r\nit feels a lot better!"\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne had seated himself, and was amused in making him talk. He was\r\nno longer angry, he felt interested in this debauched child, who was\r\nso brave and so industrious in his vices. And, in fact, he tasted\r\na certain comfort in the bottom of this hole; the heat was not too\r\ngreat, an equal temperature reigned here at all seasons, the warmth of\r\na bath, while the rough December wind was chapping the skins of the\r\nmiserable people on the earth. As they grew old, the galleries became\r\npurified from noxious gases, all the fire-damp had gone, and one only\r\nsmelled now the odour of old fermented wood, a subtle ethereal odour,\r\nas if sharpened with a dash of cloves. This wood, besides, had become\r\ncurious to look at, with a yellowish pallor of marble, fringed with\r\nwhitish thread lace, flaky vegetations which seemed to drape it with an\r\nembroidery of silk and pearls. In other places the timber was bristling\r\nwith toadstools. And there were flights of white butterflies, snowy\r\nflies and spiders, a decolorized population for ever ignorant of the\r\nsun.\r\n\r\n"Then you\'re not afraid?" asked \xc3\x89tienne.\r\n\r\nJeanlin looked at him in astonishment.\r\n\r\n"Afraid of what? I am quite alone."\r\n\r\nBut the cod was at last scraped. He lighted a little fire of wood,\r\nbrought out the pan and grilled it. Then he cut a loaf into two. It was\r\na terribly salt feast, but exquisite all the same for strong stomachs.\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne had accepted his share.\r\n\r\n"I am not astonished you get fat, while we are all growing lean. Do you\r\nknow that it is beastly to stuff yourself like this? And the others?\r\nyou don\'t think of them!"\r\n\r\n"Oh! why are the others such fools?"\r\n\r\n"Well, you\'re right to hide yourself, for if your father knew you stole\r\nhe would settle you."\r\n\r\n"What! when the bourgeois are stealing from us! It\'s you who are always\r\nsaying so. If I nabbed this loaf at Maigrat\'s you may be pretty sure\r\nit\'s a loaf he owed us."\r\n\r\nThe young man was silent, with his mouth full, and felt troubled. He\r\nlooked at him, with his muzzle, his green eyes, his large ears, a\r\ndegenerate abortion, with an obscure intelligence and savage cunning,\r\nslowly slipping back into the animality of old. The mine which had made\r\nhim had just finished him by breaking his legs.\r\n\r\n"And Lydie?" asked \xc3\x89tienne again; "do you bring her here sometimes?"\r\n\r\nJeanlin laughed contemptuously.\r\n\r\n"The little one? Ah, no, not I; women blab."\r\n\r\nAnd he went on laughing, filled with immense disdain for Lydie and\r\nB\xc3\xa9bert. Who had ever seen such boobies? To think that they swallowed\r\nall his humbug, and went away with empty hands while he ate the cod in\r\nthis warm place, tickled his sides with amusement. Then he concluded,\r\nwith the gravity of a little philosopher:\r\n\r\n"Much better be alone, then there\'s no falling out."\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne had finished his bread. He drank a gulp of the gin. For a\r\nmoment he asked himself if he ought not to make a bad return for\r\nJeanlin\'s hospitality by bringing him up to daylight by the ear, and\r\nforbidding him to plunder any more by the threat of telling everything\r\nto his father. But as he examined this deep retreat, an idea occurred\r\nto him. Who knows if there might not be need for it, either for mates\r\nor for himself, in case things should come to the worst up above! He\r\nmade the child swear not to sleep out, as had sometimes happened when\r\nhe forgot himself in his hay, and taking a candle-end, he went away\r\nfirst, leaving him to pursue quietly his domestic affairs.\r\n\r\nMouquette, seated on a beam in spite of the great cold, had grown\r\ndesperate in waiting for him. When she saw him she leapt on to his\r\nneck; and it was as though he had plunged a knife into her heart when\r\nhe said that he wished to see her no more. Good God! why? Did she not\r\nlove him enough? Fearing to yield to the desire to enter with her, he\r\ndrew her towards the road, and explained to her as gently as possible\r\nthat she was compromising him in the eyes of his mates, that she was\r\ncompromising the political cause. She was astonished; what had that\r\ngot to do with politics? At last the thought occurred to her that\r\nhe blushed at being seen with her. She was not wounded, however; it\r\nwas quite natural; and she proposed that he should rebuff her before\r\npeople, so as to seem to have broken with her. But he would see her\r\njust once sometimes. In distraction she implored him; she swore to keep\r\nout of sight; she would not keep him five minutes. He was touched,\r\nbut still refused. It was necessary. Then, as he left her, he wished\r\nat least to kiss her. They had gradually reached the first houses of\r\nMontsou, and were standing with their arms round one another beneath a\r\nlarge round moon, when a woman passed near them with a sudden start, as\r\nthough she had knocked against a stone.\r\n\r\n"Who is that?" asked \xc3\x89tienne, anxiously.\r\n\r\n"It\'s Catherine," replied Mouquette. "She\'s coming back from Jean-Bart."\r\n\r\nThe woman now was going away, with lowered head and feeble limbs,\r\nlooking very tired. And the young man gazed at her, in despair at\r\nhaving been seen by her, his heart aching with an unreasonable remorse.\r\nHad she not been with a man? Had she not made him suffer with the same\r\nsuffering here, on this R\xc3\xa9quillart road, when she had given herself to\r\nthat man? But, all the same, he was grieved to have done the like to\r\nher.\r\n\r\n"Shall I tell you what it is?" whispered Mouquette, in tears, as she\r\nleft him. "If you don\'t want me it\'s because you want someone else."\r\n\r\nOn the next day the weather was superb; it was one of those clear\r\nfrosty days, the beautiful winter days when the hard earth rings like\r\ncrystal beneath the feet. Jeanlin had gone off at one o\'clock, but\r\nhe had to wait for B\xc3\xa9bert behind the church, and they nearly set out\r\nwithout Lydie, whose mother had again shut her up in the cellar, and\r\nonly now liberated her to put a basket on her arm, telling her that\r\nif she did not bring it back full of dandelions she should be shut up\r\nwith the rats all night long. She was frightened, therefore, and wished\r\nto go at once for salad. Jeanlin dissuaded her; they would see later\r\non. For a long time Poland, Rasseneur\'s big rabbit, had attracted his\r\nattention. He was passing before the Avantage when, just then, the\r\nrabbit came out on to the road. With a leap he seized her by the ears,\r\nstuffed her into the little girl\'s basket, and all three rushed away.\r\nThey would amuse themselves finely by making her run like a dog as far\r\nas the forest.\r\n\r\nBut they stopped to gaze at Zacharie and Mouquet, who, after having\r\ndrunk a glass with two other mates, had begun their big game of\r\ncrosse. The stake was a new cap and a red handkerchief, deposited\r\nwith Rasseneur. The four players, two against two, were bidding for\r\nthe first turn from the Voreux to the Paillot farm, nearly three\r\nkilometres; and it was Zacharie who won, with seven strokes, while\r\nMouquet required eight. They had placed the ball, the little boxwood\r\negg, on the pavement with one end up. Each was holding his crosse, the\r\nmallet with its bent iron, long handle, and tight-strung network. Two\r\no\'clock struck as they set out. Zacharie, in a masterly manner, at his\r\nfirst stroke, composed of a series of three, sent the ball more than\r\nfour hundred yards across the beetroot fields; for it was forbidden to\r\nplay in the villages and on the streets, where people might be killed.\r\nMouquet, who was also a good player, sent off the ball with so vigorous\r\nan arm that his single stroke brought the ball a hundred and fifty\r\nmetres behind. And the game went on, backwards and forwards, always\r\nrunning, their feet bruised by the frozen ridges of the ploughed fields.\r\n\r\nAt first Jeanlin, B\xc3\xa9bert, and Lydie had trotted behind the players,\r\ndelighted with their vigorous strokes. Then they remembered Poland,\r\nwhom they were shaking up in the basket; and, leaving the game in the\r\nopen country, they took out the rabbit, inquisitive to see how fast\r\nshe could run. She went off, and they fled after her; it was a chase\r\nlasting an hour at full speed, with constant turns, with shouts to\r\nfrighten her, and arms opened and closed on emptiness. If she had not\r\nbeen at the beginning of pregnancy they would never have caught her\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nAs they were panting the sound of oaths made them turn their heads.\r\nThey had just come upon the crosse party again, and Zacharie had nearly\r\nsplit open his brother\'s skull. The players were now at their fourth\r\nturn. From the Paillot farm they had gone off to the Quatre-Chemins,\r\nthen from the Quatre-Chemins to Montoire; and now they were going in\r\nsix strokes from Montoire to Pr\xc3\xa9-des-Vaches. That made two leagues and\r\na half in an hour; and, besides, they had had drinks at the Estaminet\r\nVincent and at the Trois-Sages Bar. Mouquet this time was ahead. He had\r\ntwo more strokes to play, and his victory was certain, when Zacharie,\r\ngrinning as he availed himself of his privilege, played with so much\r\nskill that the ball rolled into a deep pit. Mouquet\'s partner could\r\nnot get it out; it was a disaster. All four shouted; the party was\r\nexcited, for they were neck to neck; it was necessary to begin again.\r\nFrom the Pr\xc3\xa9-des-Vaches it was not two kilometres to the point of\r\nHerbes-Rousses, in five strokes. There they would refresh themselves at\r\nLerenard\'s.\r\n\r\nBut Jeanlin had an idea. He let them go on, and pulled out of his\r\npocket a piece of string which he tied to one of Poland\'s legs, the\r\nleft hind leg. And it was very amusing. The rabbit ran before the three\r\nyoung rascals, waddling along in such an extraordinary manner that they\r\nhad never laughed so much before. Afterwards they fastened it round her\r\nneck, and let her run off; and, as she grew tired, they dragged her on\r\nher belly or on her back, just like a little carriage. That lasted for\r\nmore than an hour. She was moaning when they quickly put her back into\r\nthe basket, near the wood at Cruchot, on hearing the players whose game\r\nthey had once more came across.\r\n\r\nZacharie, Mouquet, and the two others were getting over the kilometres,\r\nwith no other rest than the time for a drink at all the inns which they\r\nhad fixed on as their goals. From the Herbes-Rousses they had gone on\r\nto Buchy, then to Croix-de-Pierre, then to Chamblay. The earth rang\r\nbeneath the helter-skelter of their feet, rushing untiringly after the\r\nball, which bounded over the ice; the weather was good, they did not\r\nfall in, they only ran the risk of breaking their legs. In the dry air\r\nthe great crosse blows exploded like firearms. Their muscular hands\r\ngrasped the strung handle; their entire bodies were bent forward, as\r\nthough to slay an ox. And this went on for hours, from one end of the\r\nplain to the other, over ditches and hedges and the slopes of the road,\r\nthe low walls of the enclosures. One needed to have good bellows in\r\none\'s chest and iron hinges in one\'s knees. The pikemen thus rubbed\r\noff the rust of the mine with impassioned zeal. There were some so\r\nenthusiastic at twenty-five that they could do ten leagues. At forty\r\nthey played no more; they were too heavy.\r\n\r\nFive o\'clock struck; the twilight was already coming on. One more turn\r\nto the Forest of Vandame, to decide who had gained the cap and the\r\nhandkerchief. And Zacharie joked, with his chaffing indifference for\r\npolitics; it would be fine to tumble down over there in the midst of\r\nthe mates. As to Jeanlin, ever since leaving the settlement he had\r\nbeen aiming at the forest, though apparently only scouring the fields.\r\nWith an indignant gesture he threatened Lydie, who was full of remorse\r\nand fear, and talked of going back to the Voreux to gather dandelions.\r\nWere they going to abandon the meeting? he wanted to know what the old\r\npeople would say. He pushed B\xc3\xa9bert, and proposed to enliven the end of\r\nthe journey as far as the trees by detaching Poland and pursuing her\r\nwith stones. His real idea was to kill her; he wanted to take her off\r\nand eat her at the bottom of his hole at R\xc3\xa9quillart. The rabbit ran\r\nahead, with nose in the air and ears back; a stone grazed her back,\r\nanother cut her tail, and, in spite of the growing darkness, she would\r\nhave been done for if the young rogues had not noticed \xc3\x89tienne and\r\nMaheu standing in the middle of a glade. They threw themselves on the\r\nanimal in desperation, and put her back in the basket. Almost at the\r\nsame minute Zacharie, Mouquet, and the two others, with their last blow\r\nat crosse, drove the ball within a few metres of the glade. They all\r\ncame into the midst of the rendezvous.\r\n\r\nThrough the whole country, by the roads and pathways of the flat plain,\r\never since twilight, there had been a long procession, a rustling of\r\nsilent shadows, moving separately or in groups towards the violet\r\nthickets of the forest. Every settlement was emptied, the women and\r\nchildren themselves set out as if for a walk beneath the great clear\r\nsky. Now the roads were growing dark; this walking crowd, all gliding\r\ntowards the same goal, could no longer be distinguished. But one felt\r\nit, the confused tramping moved by one soul. Between the hedges, among\r\nthe bushes, there was only a light rustling, a vague rumour of the\r\nvoices of the night.\r\n\r\nM. Hennebeau, who was at this hour returning home mounted on his mare,\r\nlistened to these vague sounds. He had met couples, long rows of\r\nstrollers, on this beautiful winter night. More lovers, who were going\r\nto take their pleasure, mouth to mouth, behind the walls. Was it not\r\nwhat he always met, girls tumbled over at the bottom of every ditch,\r\nbeggars who crammed themselves with the only joy that cost nothing?\r\nAnd these fools complained of life, when they could take their supreme\r\nfill of this happiness of love! Willingly would he have starved as they\r\ndid if he could begin life again with a woman who would give herself\r\nto him on a heap of stones, with all her strength and all her heart.\r\nHis misfortune was without consolation, and he envied these wretches.\r\nWith lowered head he went back, riding his horse at a slackened pace,\r\nrendered desperate by these long sounds, lost in the depth of the black\r\ncountry, in which he heard only kisses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the Plan-des-Dames, that vast glade just opened up by the\r\nfelling of trees. It spread out in a gentle slope, surrounded by\r\ntall thickets and superb beeches with straight regular trunks, which\r\nformed a white colonnade patched with green lichens; fallen giants\r\nwere also lying in the grass, while on the left a mass of logs formed\r\na geometrical cube. The cold was sharpening with the twilight and the\r\nfrozen moss crackled beneath the feet. There was black darkness on the\r\nearth while the tall branches showed against the pale sky, where a full\r\nmoon coming above the horizon would soon extinguish the stars.\r\n\r\nNearly three thousand colliers had come to the rendezvous, a swarming\r\ncrowd of men, women, and children, gradually filling the glade and\r\nspreading out afar beneath the trees. Late arrivals were still coming\r\nup, a flood of heads drowned in shadow and stretching as far as the\r\nneighbouring copses. A rumbling arose from them, like that of a storm,\r\nin this motionless and frozen forest.\r\n\r\nAt the top, dominating the slope, \xc3\x89tienne stood with Rasseneur and\r\nMaheu. A quarrel had broken out, one could hear their voices in\r\nsudden bursts. Near them some men were listening: Levaque, with\r\nclenched fists; Pierron, turning his back and much annoyed that he\r\nhad no longer been able to feign a fever. There were also Father\r\nBonnemort and old Mouque, seated side by side on a stump, lost in deep\r\nmeditation. Then behind were the chaffers, Zacharie, Mouquet, and\r\nothers who had come to make fun of the thing; while gathered together\r\nin a very different spirit the women in a group were as serious as\r\nif at church. Maheude silently shook her head at the Levaque woman\'s\r\nmuttered oaths. Philom\xc3\xa9ne was coughing, her bronchitis having come back\r\nwith the winter. Only Mouquette was showing her teeth with laughter,\r\namused at the way in which Mother Brul\xc3\xa9 was abusing her daughter, an\r\nunnatural creature who had sent her away that she might gorge herself\r\nwith rabbit, a creature who had sold herself and who fattened on her\r\nman\'s cowardice. And Jeanlin had planted himself on the pile of wood,\r\nhoisting up Lydie and making B\xc3\xa9bert follow him, all three higher up in\r\nthe air than any one else.\r\n\r\nThe quarrel was raised by Rasseneur, who wished to proceed formally\r\nto the election of officers. He was enraged by his defeat at the\r\nBon-Joyeux, and had sworn to have his revenge, for he flattered himself\r\nthat he could regain his old authority when he was once face to face,\r\nnot with the delegates, but with the miners themselves. \xc3\x89tienne was\r\ndisgusted, and thought the idea of officers was ridiculous in this\r\nforest. They ought to act in a revolutionary fashion, like savages,\r\nsince they were tracked like wolves.\r\n\r\nAs the dispute threatened to drag on, he took possession of the crowd\r\nat once by jumping on to the trunk of a tree and shouting:\r\n\r\n"Comrades! comrades!"\r\n\r\nThe confused roar of the crowd died down into a long sigh, while Maheu\r\nstifled Rasseneur\'s protestations. \xc3\x89tienne went on in a loud voice.\r\n\r\n"Comrades, since they forbid us to speak, since they send the police\r\nafter us as if we were robbers, we have come to talk here! Here we are\r\nfree, we are at home. No one can silence us any more than they can\r\nsilence the birds and beasts!"\r\n\r\nA thunder of cries and exclamations responded to him.\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes! the forest is ours, we can talk here. Go on."\r\n\r\nThen \xc3\x89tienne stood for a moment motionless on the tree-trunk. The moon,\r\nstill beneath the horizon, only lit up the topmost branches, and the\r\ncrowd, remaining in the darkness, stood above it at the top of the\r\nslope like a bar of shadow.\r\n\r\nHe raised his arm with a slow movement and began. But his voice was not\r\nfierce; he spoke in the cold tones of a simple envoy of the people,\r\nwho was rendering his account. He was delivering the discourse which\r\nthe commissioner of police had cut short at the Bon-Joyeux; and he\r\nbegan by a rapid history of the strike, affecting a certain scientific\r\neloquence--facts, nothing but facts. At first he spoke of his dislike\r\nto the strike; the miners had not desired it, it was the management\r\nwhich had provoked it with the new timbering tariff. Then he recalled\r\nthe first step taken by the delegates in going to the manager, the\r\nbad faith of the directors; and, later on, the second step, the tardy\r\nconcession, the ten centimes given up, after the attempt to rob them.\r\nNow he showed by figures the exhaustion of the Provident Fund, and\r\npointed out the use that had been made of the help sent, briefly\r\nexcusing the International, Pluchart and the others, for not being able\r\nto do more for them in the midst of the cares of their conquest of the\r\nworld. So the situation was getting worse every day; the Company was\r\ngiving back certificates and threatening to hire men from Belgium;\r\nbesides, it was intimidating the weak, and had forced a certain number\r\nof miners to go down again. He preserved his monotonous voice, as if to\r\ninsist on the bad news; he said that hunger was victorious, that hope\r\nwas dead, and that the struggle had reached the last feverish efforts\r\nof courage. And then he suddenly concluded, without raising his voice:\r\n\r\n"It is in these circumstances, mates, that you have to take a decision\r\nto-night. Do you want the strike to go on? and if so, what do you\r\nexpect to do to beat the Company?"\r\n\r\nA deep silence fell from the starry sky. The crowd, which could not be\r\nseen, was silent in the night beneath these words which choked every\r\nheart, and a sigh of despair could be heard through the trees.\r\n\r\nBut \xc3\x89tienne was already continuing, with a change in his voice. It\r\nwas no longer the secretary of the association who was speaking; it\r\nwas the chief of a band, the apostle who was bringing truth. Could it\r\nbe that any were cowardly enough to go back on their word? What! They\r\nwere to suffer in vain for a month, and then to go back to the pits,\r\nwith lowered heads, so that the everlasting wretchedness might begin\r\nover again! Would it not be better to die at once in the effort to\r\ndestroy this tyranny of capital, which was starving the worker? Always\r\nto submit to hunger up to the moment when hunger will again throw the\r\ncalmest into revolt, was it not a foolish game which could not go on\r\nfor ever? And he pointed to the exploited miners, bearing alone the\r\ndisasters of every crisis, reduced to go without food as soon as the\r\nnecessities of competition lowered net prices. No, the timbering tariff\r\ncould not be accepted; it was only a disguised effort to economize on\r\nthe Company\'s part; they wanted to rob every man of an hour\'s work a\r\nday. It was too much this time; the day was coming when the miserable,\r\npushed to extremity, would deal justice.\r\n\r\nHe stood with his arms in the air. At the word "justice" the crowd,\r\nshaken by a long shudder, broke out into applause which rolled along\r\nwith the sound of dry leaves. Voices cried:\r\n\r\n"Justice! it is time! Justice!"\r\n\r\nGradually \xc3\x89tienne grew heated. He had not Rasseneur\'s easy flowing\r\nabundance. Words often failed him, he had to force his phrases,\r\nbringing them out with an effort which he emphasized by a movement of\r\nhis shoulders. Only in these continual shocks he came upon familiar\r\nimages which seized on his audience by their energy; while his\r\nworkman\'s gestures, his elbows in and then extended, with his fists\r\nthrust out, his jaw suddenly advanced as if to bite, had also an\r\nextraordinary effect on his mates. They all said that if he was not big\r\nhe made himself heard.\r\n\r\n"The wage system is a new form of slavery," he began again, in a more\r\nsonorous voice. "The mine ought to belong to the miner, as the sea\r\nbelongs to the fisherman, and the earth to the peasant. Do you see? The\r\nmine belongs to you, to all of you who, for a century, have paid for it\r\nwith so much blood and misery!"\r\n\r\nHe boldly entered on obscure questions of law, and lost himself in the\r\ndifficulties of the special regulations concerning mines. The subsoil,\r\nlike the soil, belonged to the nation: only an odious privilege gave\r\nthe monopoly of it to the Companies; all the more since, at Montsou,\r\nthe pretended legality of the concession was complicated by treaties\r\nformerly made with the owners of the old fiefs, according to the\r\nancient custom of Hainault. The miners, then, had only to reconquer\r\ntheir property; and with extended hands he indicated the whole country\r\nbeyond the forest. At this moment the moon, which had risen above the\r\nhorizon, lit him up as it glided from behind the high branches. When\r\nthe crowd, which was still in shadow, saw him thus, white with light,\r\ndistributing fortune with his open hands, they applauded anew by\r\nprolonged clapping.\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, he\'s right. Bravo!"\r\n\r\nThen \xc3\x89tienne trotted out his favourite subject, the assumption of the\r\ninstruments of production by the collectivity, as he kept on saying\r\nin a phrase the pedantry of which greatly pleased him. At the present\r\ntime his evolution was completed. Having set out with the sentimental\r\nfraternity of the novice and the need for reforming the wage system, he\r\nhad reached the political idea of its suppression. Since the meeting\r\nat the Bon-Joyeux his collectivism, still humanitarian and without a\r\nformula, had stiffened into a complicated programme which he discussed\r\nscientifically, article by article. First, he affirmed that freedom\r\ncould only be obtained by the destruction of the state. Then, when the\r\npeople had obtained possession of the government, reforms would begin:\r\nreturn to the primitive commune, substitution of an equal and free\r\nfamily for the moral and oppressive family; absolute equality, civil,\r\npolitical, and economic; individual independence guaranteed, thanks\r\nto the possession of the integral product of the instruments of work;\r\nfinally, free vocational education, paid for by the collectivity. This\r\nled to the total reconstruction of the old rotten society; he attacked\r\nmarriage, the right of bequest, he regulated every one\'s fortune, he\r\nthrew down the iniquitous monument of the dead centuries with a great\r\nmovement of his arm, always the same movement, the movement of the\r\nreaper who is cutting down a ripe harvest. And then with the other hand\r\nhe reconstructed; he built up the future humanity, the edifice of truth\r\nand justice rising in the dawn of the twentieth century. In this state\r\nof mental tension reason trembled, and only the sectarian\'s fixed idea\r\nwas left. The scruples of sensibility and of good sense were lost;\r\nnothing seemed easier than the realization of this new world. He had\r\nforeseen everything; he spoke of it as of a machine which he could put\r\ntogether in two hours, and he stuck at neither fire nor blood.\r\n\r\n"Our turn is come," he broke out for the last time. "Now it is for us\r\nto have power and wealth!"\r\n\r\nThe cheering rolled up to him from the depths of the forest. The moon\r\nnow whitened the whole of the glade, and cut into living waves the sea\r\nof heads, as far as the dimly visible copses in the distance between\r\nthe great grey trunks. And in the icy air there was a fury of faces,\r\nof gleaming eyes, of open mouths, a rut of famishing men, women, and\r\nchildren, let loose on the just pillage of the ancient wealth they had\r\nbeen deprived of. They no longer felt the cold, these burning words\r\nhad warmed them to the bone. Religious exaltation raised them from the\r\nearth, a fever of hope like that of the Christians of the early Church\r\nawaiting the near coming of justice. Many obscure phrases had escaped\r\nthem, they could not properly understand this technical and abstract\r\nreasoning; but the very obscurity and abstraction still further\r\nenlarged the field of promises and lifted them into a dazzling region.\r\nWhat a dream! to be masters, to suffer no more, to enjoy at last!\r\n\r\n"That\'s it, by God! it\'s our turn now! Down with the exploiters."\r\n\r\nThe women were delirious; Maheude, losing her calmness, was seized\r\nwith the vertigo of hunger, the Levaque woman shouted, old Brul\xc3\xa9,\r\ncarried out of herself, was brandishing her witch-like arms, Philom\xc3\xa9ne\r\nwas shaken by a spasm of coughing, and Mouquette was so excited that\r\nshe cried out words of tenderness to the orator. Among the men,\r\nMaheu was won over and shouted with anger, between Pierron who was\r\ntrembling and Levaque who was talking too much; while the chaffers,\r\nZacharie and Mouquet, though trying to make fun of things, were feeling\r\nuncomfortable and were surprised that their mate could talk on so long\r\nwithout having a drink. But on top of the pile of wood, Jeanlin was\r\nmaking more noise than any one, egging on B\xc3\xa9bert and Lydie and shaking\r\nthe basket in which Poland lay.\r\n\r\nThe clamour began again. \xc3\x89tienne was enjoying the intoxication of his\r\npopularity. He held power, as it were, materialized in these three\r\nthousand breasts, whose hearts he could move with a word. Souvarine,\r\nif he had cared to come, would have applauded his ideas so far as he\r\nrecognized them, pleased with his pupil\'s progress in anarchism and\r\nsatisfied with the programme, except the article on education, a relic\r\nof silly sentimentality, for men needed to be dipped in a bath of holy\r\nand salutary ignorance. As to Rasseneur, he shrugged his shoulders with\r\ncontempt and anger.\r\n\r\n"You shall let me speak," he shouted to \xc3\x89tienne.\r\n\r\nThe latter jumped from the tree-trunk.\r\n\r\n"Speak, we shall see if they\'ll hear you."\r\n\r\nAlready Rasseneur had replaced him, and with a gesture demanded\r\nsilence. But the noise did not cease; his name went round from the\r\nfirst ranks, who had recognized him, to the last, lost beneath the\r\nbeeches, and they refused to hear him; he was an overturned idol, the\r\nmere sight of him angered his old disciples. His facile elocution,\r\nhis flowing, good-natured speech, which had so long charmed them, was\r\nnow treated like warm gruel made to put cowards to sleep. In vain he\r\ntalked through the noise, trying to take up again his discourse of\r\nconciliation, the impossibility of changing the world by a stroke of\r\nlaw, the necessity of allowing the social evolution time to accomplish\r\nitself; they joked him, they hissed him; his defeat at the Bon-Joyeux\r\nwas now beyond repair. At last they threw handfuls of frozen moss at\r\nhim, and a woman cried in a shrill voice:\r\n\r\n"Down with the traitor!"\r\n\r\nHe explained that the miner could not be the proprietor of the mine, as\r\nthe weaver is of his loom, and he said that he preferred sharing in the\r\nbenefits, the interested worker becoming the child of the house.\r\n\r\n"Down with the traitor!" repeated a thousand voices, while stones began\r\nto whistle by.\r\n\r\nThen he turned pale, and despair filled his eyes with tears. His whole\r\nexistence was crumbling down; twenty years of ambitious comradeship\r\nwere breaking down beneath the ingratitude of the crowd. He came down\r\nfrom the tree-trunk, with no strength to go on, struck to the heart.\r\n\r\n"That makes you laugh," he stammered, addressing the triumphant\r\n\xc3\x89tienne. "Good! I hope your turn will come. It will come, I tell you!"\r\n\r\nAnd as if to reject all responsibility for the evils which he foresaw,\r\nhe made a large gesture, and went away alone across the country, pale\r\nand silent.\r\n\r\nHoots arose, and then they were surprised to see Father Bonnemort\r\nstanding on the trunk and about to speak in the midst of the tumult.\r\nUp till now Mouque and he had remained absorbed, with that air that\r\nthey always had of reflecting on former things. No doubt he was\r\nyielding to one of those sudden crises of garrulity which sometimes\r\nmade the past stir in him so violently that recollections rose and\r\nflowed from his lips for hours at a time. There was deep silence, and\r\nthey listened to this old man, who was like a pale spectre beneath\r\nthe moon, and as he narrated things without any immediate relation\r\nwith the discussion--long histories which no one could understand--the\r\nimpression was increased. He was talking of his youth; he described\r\nthe death of his two uncles who were crushed at the Voreux; then he\r\nturned to the inflammation of the lungs which had carried off his\r\nwife. He kept to his main idea, however: things had never gone well\r\nand never would go well. Thus in the forest five hundred of them had\r\ncome together because the king would not lessen the hours of work; but\r\nhe stopped short, and began to tell of another strike--he had seen so\r\nmany! They all broke out under these trees, here at the Plan-des-Dames,\r\nlower down at the Charbonnerie, still farther towards the Saut-du-Loup.\r\nSometimes it froze, sometimes it was hot. One evening it had rained so\r\nmuch that they had gone back again without being able to say anything,\r\nand the king\'s soldiers came up and it finished with volleys of\r\nmusketry.\r\n\r\n"We raised our hands like this, and we swore not to go back again. Ah!\r\nI have sworn; yes, I have sworn!"\r\n\r\nThe crowd listened gapingly, feeling disturbed, when \xc3\x89tienne, who had\r\nwatched the scene, jumped on to the fallen tree, keeping the old man\r\nat his side. He had just recognized Chaval among their friends in the\r\nfirst row. The idea that Catherine must be there had roused a new\r\nardour within him, the desire to be applauded in her presence.\r\n\r\n"Mates, you have heard; this is one of our old men, and this is what he\r\nhas suffered, and what our children will suffer if we don\'t have done\r\nwith the robbers and butchers."\r\n\r\nHe was terrible; never had he spoken so violently. With one arm he\r\nsupported old Bonnemort, exhibiting him as a banner of misery and\r\nmourning, and crying for vengeance. In a few rapid phrases he went\r\nback to the first Maheu. He showed the whole family used up at the\r\nmine, devoured by the Company, hungrier than ever after a hundred\r\nyears of work; and contrasting with the Maheus he pointed to the big\r\nbellies of the directors sweating gold, a whole band of shareholders,\r\ngoing on for a century like kept women, doing nothing but enjoy with\r\ntheir bodies. Was it not fearful? a race of men dying down below, from\r\nfather to son, so that bribes of wine could be given to ministers, and\r\ngenerations of great lords and bourgeois could give feasts or fatten\r\nby their firesides! He had studied the diseases of the miners. He\r\nmade them all march past with their awful details: anaemia, scrofula,\r\nblack bronchitis, the asthma which chokes, and the rheumatism which\r\nparalyses. These wretches were thrown as food to the engines and penned\r\nup like beasts in the settlements. The great companies absorbed them,\r\nregulating their slavery, threatening to enrol all the workers of the\r\nnation, millions of hands, to bring fortune to a thousand idlers. But\r\nthe miner was no longer an ignorant brute, crushed within the bowels\r\nof the earth. An army was springing up from the depths of the pits, a\r\nharvest of citizens whose seed would germinate and burst through the\r\nearth some sunny day. And they would see then if, after forty years of\r\nservice, any one would dare to offer a pension of a hundred and fifty\r\nfrancs to an old man of sixty who spat out coal and whose legs were\r\nswollen with the water from the cuttings. Yes! labour would demand\r\nan account from capital: that impersonal god, unknown to the worker,\r\ncrouching down somewhere in his mysterious sanctuary, where he sucked\r\nthe life out of the starvelings who nourished him! They would go down\r\nthere; they would at last succeed in seeing his face by the gleam of\r\nincendiary fires, they would drown him in blood, that filthy swine,\r\nthat monstrous idol, gorged with human flesh!\r\n\r\nHe was silent, but his arm, still extended in space, indicated the\r\nenemy, down there, he knew not where, from one end of the earth to the\r\nother. This time the clamour of the crowd was so great that people at\r\nMontsou heard it, and looked towards Vandame, seized with anxiety at\r\nthe thought that some terrible landslip had occurred. Night-birds rose\r\nabove the trees in the clear open sky.\r\n\r\nHe now concluded his speech.\r\n\r\n"Mates, what is your decision? Do you vote for the strike to go on?"\r\n\r\nTheir voices yelled, "Yes! yes!"\r\n\r\n"And what steps do you decide on? We are sure of defeat if cowards go\r\ndown to-morrow."\r\n\r\nTheir voices rose again with the sound of a tempest:\r\n\r\n"Kill the cowards!"\r\n\r\n"Then you decide to call them back to duty and to their sworn word.\r\nThis is what we could do: present ourselves at the pits, bring back the\r\ntraitors by our presence, show the Company that we are all agreed, and\r\nthat we are going to die rather than yield."\r\n\r\n"That\'s it. To the pits! to the pits!"\r\n\r\nWhile he was speaking \xc3\x89tienne had looked for Catherine among the pale\r\nshouting heads before him. She was certainly not there, but he still\r\nsaw Chaval, affecting to jeer, shrugging his shoulders, but devoured by\r\njealousy and ready to sell himself for a little of this popularity.\r\n\r\n"And if there are any spies among us, mates," \xc3\x89tienne went on, "let\r\nthem look out; they\'re known. Yes, I can see Vandame colliers here who\r\nhave not left their pit."\r\n\r\n"Is that meant for me?" asked Chaval, with an air of bravado.\r\n\r\n"For you, or for any one else. But, since you speak, you ought to\r\nunderstand that those who eat have nothing to do with those who are\r\nstarving. You work at Jean-Bart."\r\n\r\nA chaffing voice interrupted:\r\n\r\n"Oh! he work! he\'s got a wife who works for him."\r\n\r\nChaval swore, while the blood rose to his face.\r\n\r\n"By God! is it forbidden to work, then?"\r\n\r\n"Yes!" said \xc3\x89tienne, "when your mates are enduring misery for the good\r\nof all, it is forbidden to go over, like a selfish sneaking coward,\r\nto the masters\' side. If the strike had been general we should have\r\ngot the best of it long ago. Not a single man at Vandame ought to have\r\ngone down when Montsou is resting. To accomplish the great stroke, work\r\nshould be stopped in the entire country, at Monsieur Deneulin\'s as well\r\nas here. Do you understand? there are only traitors in the Jean Bart\r\ncuttings; you\'re all traitors!"\r\n\r\nThe crowd around Chaval grew threatening, and fists were raised and\r\ncries of "Kill him! kill him!" began to be uttered. He had grown pale.\r\nBut, in his infuriated desire to triumph over \xc3\x89tienne, an idea restored\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"Listen to me, then! come to-morrow to Jean-Bart, and you shall see if\r\nI\'m working! We\'re on your side; they\'ve sent me to tell you so. The\r\nfires must be extinguished, and the engine-men, too, must go on strike.\r\nAll the better if the pumps do stop! the water will destroy the pits\r\nand everything will be done for!"\r\n\r\nHe was furiously applauded in his turn, and now \xc3\x89tienne himself was\r\noutflanked. Other orators succeeded each other from the tree-trunk,\r\ngesticulating amid the tumult, and throwing out wild propositions.\r\nIt was a mad outburst of faith, the impatience of a religious sect\r\nwhich, tired of hoping for the expected miracle, had at last decided\r\nto provoke it. These heads, emptied by famine, saw everything red, and\r\ndreamed of fire and blood in the midst of a glorious apotheosis from\r\nwhich would arise universal happiness. And the tranquil moon bathed\r\nthis surging sea, the deep forest encircled with its vast silence this\r\ncry of massacre. The frozen moss crackled beneath the heels of the\r\ncrowd, while the beeches, erect in their strength, with the delicate\r\ntracery of their black branches against the white sky, neither saw nor\r\nheard the miserable beings who writhed at their feet.\r\n\r\nThere was some pushing, and Maheude found herself near Maheu. Both of\r\nthem, driven out of their ordinary good sense, and carried away by\r\nthe slow exasperation which had been working within them for months,\r\napproved Levaque, who went to extremes by demanding the heads of the\r\nengineers. Pierron had disappeared. Bonnemort and Mouque were both\r\ntalking together, saying vague violent things which nobody heard. For a\r\njoke Zacharie demanded the demolition of the churches, while Mouquet,\r\nwith his crosse in his hand, was beating it against the ground for\r\nthe sake of increasing the row. The women were furious. The Levaque,\r\nwith her fists to her hips, was setting to with Philom\xc3\xa9ne, whom she\r\naccused of having laughed; Mouquette talked of attacking the gendarmes\r\nby kicking them somewhere; Mother Brul\xc3\xa9, who had just slapped Lydie on\r\nfinding her without either basket or salad, went on launching blows\r\ninto space against all the masters whom she would like to have got at.\r\nFor a moment Jeanlin was in terror, B\xc3\xa9bert having learned through a\r\ntrammer that Madame Rasseneur had seen them steal Poland; but when he\r\nhad decided to go back and quietly release the beast at the door of\r\nthe Avantage, he shouted louder than ever, and opened his new knife,\r\nbrandishing the blade and proud of its glitter.\r\n\r\n"Mates! mates!" repeated the exhausted \xc3\x89tienne, hoarse with the effort\r\nto obtain a moment\'s silence for a definite understanding.\r\n\r\nAt last they listened.\r\n\r\n"Mates! to-morrow morning at Jean-Bart, is it agreed?"\r\n\r\n"Yes! yes! at Jean-Bart! death to the traitors!"\r\n\r\nThe tempest of these three thousand voices filled the sky, and died\r\naway in the pure brightness of the moon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART FIVE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\n\r\nAt four o\'clock the moon had set, and the night was very dark.\r\nEverything was still asleep at Deneulin\'s; the old brick house stood\r\nmute and gloomy, with closed doors and windows, at the end of the large\r\nill-kept garden which separated it from the Jean-Bart mine. The other\r\nfrontage faced the deserted road to Vandame, a large country town,\r\nabout three kilometres off, hidden behind the forest.\r\n\r\nDeneulin, tired after a day spent in part below, was snoring with his\r\nface toward the wall, when he dreamt that he had been called. At last\r\nhe awoke, and really hearing a voice, got out and opened the window.\r\nOne of his captains was in the garden.\r\n\r\n"What is it, then?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"There\'s a rebellion, sir; half the men will not work, and are\r\npreventing the others from going down."\r\n\r\nHe scarcely understood, with head heavy and dazed with sleep, and the\r\ngreat cold struck him like an icy douche.\r\n\r\n"Then make them go down, by George!" he stammered.\r\n\r\n"It\'s been going on an hour," said the captain. "Then we thought it\r\nbest to come for you. Perhaps you will be able to persuade them."\r\n\r\n"Very good; I\'ll go."\r\n\r\nHe quickly dressed himself, his mind quite clear now, and very\r\nanxious. The house might have been pillaged; neither the cook nor the\r\nman-servant had stirred. But from the other side of the staircase\r\nalarmed voices were whispering; and when he came out he saw his\r\ndaughters\' door open, and they both appeared in white dressing-gowns,\r\nslipped on in haste.\r\n\r\n"Father, what is it?"\r\n\r\nLucie, the elder, was already twenty-two, a tall dark girl, with a\r\nhaughty air; while Jeanne, the younger, as yet scarcely nineteen years\r\nold, was small, with golden hair and a certain caressing grace.\r\n\r\n"Nothing serious," he replied, to reassure them. "It seems that some\r\nblusterers are making a disturbance down there. I am going to see."\r\n\r\nBut they exclaimed that they would not let him go before he had taken\r\nsomething warm. If not, he would come back ill, with his stomach out of\r\norder, as he always did. He struggled, gave his word of honour that he\r\nwas too much in a hurry.\r\n\r\n"Listen!" said Jeanne, at last, hanging to his neck, "you must drink a\r\nlittle glass of rum and eat two biscuits, or I shall remain like this,\r\nand you\'ll have to take me with you."\r\n\r\nHe resigned himself, declaring that the biscuits would choke him. They\r\nhad already gone down before him, each with her candlestick. In the\r\ndining-room below they hastened to serve him, one pouring out the rum,\r\nthe other running to the pantry for the biscuits. Having lost their\r\nmother when very young, they had been rather badly brought up alone,\r\nspoilt by their father, the elder haunted by the dream of singing\r\non the stage, the younger mad over painting in which she showed a\r\nsingular boldness of taste. But when they had to retrench after the\r\nembarrassment in their affairs, these apparently extravagant girls\r\nhad suddenly developed into very sensible and shrewd managers, with\r\nan eye for errors of centimes in accounts. Today, with their boyish\r\nand artistic demeanour, they kept the purse, were careful over sous,\r\nhaggled with the tradesmen, renovated their dresses unceasingly, and in\r\nfact, succeeded in rendering decent the growing embarrassment of the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n"Eat, papa," repeated Lucie.\r\n\r\nThen, remarking his silent gloomy preoccupation, she was again\r\nfrightened.\r\n\r\n"Is it serious, then, that you look at us like this? Tell us; we will\r\nstay with you, and they can do without us at that lunch."\r\n\r\nShe was speaking of a party which had been planned for the morning,\r\nMadame Hennebeau was to go in her carriage, first for C\xc3\xa9cile, at\r\nthe Gr\xc3\xa9goires\', then to call for them, so that they could all go to\r\nMarchiennes to lunch at the Forges, where the manager\'s wife had\r\ninvited them. It was an opportunity to visit the workshops, the blast\r\nfurnaces, and the coke ovens.\r\n\r\n"We will certainly remain," declared Jeanne, in her turn.\r\n\r\nBut he grew angry.\r\n\r\n"A fine idea! I tell you that it is nothing. Just be so good as to get\r\nback into your beds again, and dress yourselves for nine o\'clock, as\r\nwas arranged."\r\n\r\nHe kissed them and hastened to leave. They heard the noise of his boots\r\nvanishing over the frozen earth in the garden.\r\n\r\nJeanne carefully placed the stopper in the rum bottle, while Lucie\r\nlocked up the biscuits. The room had the cold neatness of dining-rooms\r\nwhere the table is but meagrely supplied. And both of them took\r\nadvantage of this early descent to see if anything had been left\r\nuncared for the evening before. A serviette lay about, the servant\r\nshould be scolded. At last they were upstairs again.\r\n\r\nWhile he was taking the shortest cut through the narrow paths of his\r\nkitchen garden, Deneulin was thinking of his compromised fortune,\r\nthis Montsou denier, this million which he had realized, dreaming to\r\nmultiply it tenfold, and which was to-day running such great risks.\r\nIt was an uninterrupted course of ill-luck, enormous and unforeseen\r\nrepairs, ruinous conditions of exploitation, then the disaster of this\r\nindustrial crisis, just when the profits were beginning to come in. If\r\nthe strike broke out here, he would be overthrown. He pushed a little\r\ndoor: the buildings of the pit could be divined in the black night, by\r\nthe deepening of the shadow, starred by a few lanterns.\r\n\r\nJean-Bart was not so important as the Voreux, but its renewed\r\ninstallation made it a pretty pit, as the engineers say. They had\r\nnot been contented by enlarging the shaft one metre and a half, and\r\ndeepening it to seven hundred and eight metres, they had equipped it\r\nafresh with a new engine, new cages, entirely new material, all set up\r\naccording to the latest scientific improvements; and even a certain\r\nseeking for elegance was visible in the constructions, a screening-shed\r\nwith carved frieze, a steeple adorned with a clock, a receiving-room\r\nand an engine-room both rounded into an apse like a Renaissance\r\nchapel, and surmounted by a chimney with a mosaic spiral made of black\r\nbricks and red bricks. The pump was placed on the other shaft of the\r\nconcession, the old Gaston-Marie pit, reserved solely for this purpose.\r\nJean-Bart, to right and left of the winding-shaft, only had two\r\nconduits, that for the steam ventilator and that for the ladders.\r\n\r\nIn the morning, ever since three o\'clock, Chaval, who had arrived\r\nfirst, had been seducing his comrades, convincing them that they ought\r\nto imitate those at Montsou, and demand an increase of five centimes\r\na tram. Soon four hundred workmen had passed from the shed into the\r\nreceiving-room, in the midst of a tumult of gesticulation and shouting.\r\nThose who wished to work stood with their lamps, barefooted, with\r\nshovel or pick beneath their arms; while the others, still in their\r\nsabots, with their overcoats on their shoulders because of the great\r\ncold, were barring the shaft; and the captains were growing hoarse in\r\nthe effort to restore order, begging them to be reasonable and not to\r\nprevent those who wanted from going down.\r\n\r\nBut Chaval was furious when he saw Catherine in her trousers and\r\njacket, her head tied up in the blue cap. On getting up, he had roughly\r\ntold her to stay in bed. In despair at this arrest of work she had\r\nfollowed him all the same, for he never gave her any money; she often\r\nhad to pay both for herself and him; and what was to become of her if\r\nshe earned nothing? She was overcome by fear, the fear of a brothel\r\nat Marchiennes, which was the end of putter-girls without bread and\r\nwithout lodging.\r\n\r\n"By God!" cried Chaval, "what the devil have you come here for?"\r\n\r\nShe stammered that she had no income to live on and that she wanted to\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n"Then you put yourself against me, wench? Back you go at once, or I\'ll\r\ngo back with you and kick my sabots into your backside."\r\n\r\nShe recoiled timidly but she did not leave, resolved to see how things\r\nwould turn out. Deneulin had arrived by the screening-stairs. In\r\nspite of the weak light of the lanterns, with a quick look he took in\r\nthe scene, with this rabble wrapt in shadow; he knew every face--the\r\npikemen, the porters, the landers, the putters, even the trammers. In\r\nthe nave, still new and clean, the arrested task was waiting; the steam\r\nin the engine, under pressure, made slight whistling sounds; the cages\r\nwere hanging motionless to the cables; the trams, abandoned on the\r\nway, were encumbering the metal floors. Scarcely eighty lamps had been\r\ntaken; the others were flaming in the lamp cabin. But no doubt a word\r\nfrom him would suffice, and the whole life of labour would begin again.\r\n\r\n"Well, what\'s going on then, my lads?" he asked in a loud voice. "What\r\nare you angry about? Just explain to me and we will see if we can\r\nagree."\r\n\r\nHe usually behaved in a paternal way towards his men, while at the\r\nsame time demanding hard work. With an authoritative, rough manner, he\r\nhad tried to conquer them by a good nature which had its outbursts of\r\npassion, and he often gained their love; the men especially respected\r\nin him his courage, always in the cuttings with them, the first in\r\ndanger whenever an accident terrified the pit. Twice, after fire-damp\r\nexplosions, he had been let down, fastened by a rope under his armpits,\r\nwhen the bravest drew back.\r\n\r\n"Now," he began again, "you are not going to make me repent of having\r\ntrusted you. You know that I have refused police protection. Talk\r\nquietly and I will hear you."\r\n\r\nAll were now silent and awkward, moving away from him; and it was\r\nChaval who at last said:\r\n\r\n"Well, Monsieur Deneulin, we can\'t go on working; we must have five\r\ncentimes more the tram."\r\n\r\nHe seemed surprised.\r\n\r\n"What! five centimes! and why this demand? I don\'t complain about your\r\ntimbering, I don\'t want to impose a new tariff on you like the Montsou\r\ndirectors."\r\n\r\n"Maybe! but the Montsou mates are right, all the same. They won\'t have\r\nthe tariff, and they want a rise of five centimes because it is not\r\npossible to work properly at the present rates. We want five centimes\r\nmore, don\'t we, you others?"\r\n\r\nVoices approved, and the noise began again in the midst of violent\r\ngesticulation. Gradually they drew near, forming a small circle.\r\n\r\nA flame came into Deneulin\'s eyes, and his fist, that of a man who\r\nliked strong government, was clenched, for fear of yielding to the\r\ntemptation of seizing one of them by the neck. He preferred to discuss\r\non the basis of reason.\r\n\r\n"You want five centimes, and I agree that the work is worth it. Only\r\nI can\'t give it. If I gave it I should simply be done for. You must\r\nunderstand that I have to live first in order for you to live, and\r\nI\'ve got to the end, the least rise in net prices will upset me. Two\r\nyears ago, you remember, at the time of the last strike, I yielded, I\r\nwas able to then. But that rise of wages was not the less ruinous, for\r\nthese two years have been a struggle. To-day I would rather let the\r\nwhole thing go than not be able to tell next month where to get the\r\nmoney to pay you."\r\n\r\nChaval laughed roughly in the face of this master who told them his\r\naffairs so frankly. The others lowered their faces, obstinate and\r\nincredulous, refusing to take into their heads the idea that a master\r\ndid not gain millions out of his men.\r\n\r\nThen Deneulin, persisting, explained his struggle with Montsou, always\r\non the watch and ready to devour him if, some day, he had the stupidity\r\nto come to grief. It was a savage competition which forced him to\r\neconomize, the more so since the great depth of Jean-Bart increased the\r\nprice of extraction, an unfavourable condition hardly compensated by\r\nthe great thickness of the coal-beds. He would never have raised wages\r\nafter the last strike if it had not been necessary for him to imitate\r\nMontsou, for fear of seeing his men leave him. And he threatened them\r\nwith the morrow; a fine result it would be for them, if they obliged\r\nhim to sell, to pass beneath the terrible yoke of the directors! He did\r\nnot sit on a throne far away in an unknown sanctuary; he was not one\r\nof those shareholders who pay agents to skin the miner who has never\r\nseen them; he was a master, he risked something besides his money, he\r\nrisked his intelligence, his health, his life. Stoppage of work would\r\nsimply mean death, for he had no stock, and he must fulfil orders.\r\nBesides, his standing capital could not sleep. How could he keep his\r\nengagements? Who would pay the interest on the sums his friends had\r\nconfided to him? It would mean bankruptcy.\r\n\r\n"That\'s where we are, my good fellows," he said, in conclusion. "I want\r\nto convince you. We don\'t ask a man to cut his own throat, do we? and\r\nif I give you your five centimes, or if I let you go out on strike,\r\nit\'s the same as if I cut my throat."\r\n\r\nHe was silent. Grunts went round. A party among the miners seemed to\r\nhesitate. Several went back towards the shaft.\r\n\r\n"At least," said a captain, "let every one be free. Who are those who\r\nwant to work?"\r\n\r\nCatherine had advanced among the first. But Chaval fiercely pushed her\r\nback, shouting:\r\n\r\n"We are all agreed; it\'s only bloody rogues who\'ll leave their mates!"\r\n\r\nAfter that, conciliation appeared impossible. The cries began again,\r\nand men were hustled away from the shaft, at the risk of being crushed\r\nagainst the walls. For a moment the manager, in despair, tried to\r\nstruggle alone, to reduce the crowd by violence; but it was useless\r\nmadness, and he retired. For a few minutes he rested, out of breath, on\r\na chair in the receiver\'s office, so overcome by his powerlessness that\r\nno ideas came to him. At last he grew calm, and told an inspector to go\r\nand bring Chaval; then, when the latter had agreed to the interview, he\r\nmotioned the others away.\r\n\r\n"Leave us."\r\n\r\nDeneulin\'s idea was to see what this fellow was after. At the first\r\nwords he felt that he was vain, and was devoured by passionate\r\njealousy. Then he attacked him by flattery, affecting surprise that\r\na workman of his merit should so compromise his future. It seemed as\r\nthough he had long had his eyes on him for rapid advancement; and\r\nhe ended by squarely offering to make him captain later on. Chaval\r\nlistened in silence, with his fists at first clenched, but then\r\ngradually unbent. Something was working in the depths of his skull;\r\nif he persisted in the strike he would be nothing more than \xc3\x89tienne\'s\r\nlieutenant, while now another ambition opened, that of passing into the\r\nranks of the bosses. The heat of pride rose to his face and intoxicated\r\nhim. Besides, the band of strikers whom he had expected since the\r\nmorning had not arrived; some obstacle must have stopped them, perhaps\r\nthe police; it was time to submit. But all the same he shook his head;\r\nhe acted the incorruptible man, striking his breast indignantly. Then,\r\nwithout mentioning to the master the rendezvous he had given to the\r\nMontsou men, he promised to calm his mates, and to persuade them to go\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nDeneulin remained hidden, and the captains themselves stood aside. For\r\nan hour they heard Chaval orating and discussing, standing on a tram in\r\nthe receiving-room. Some of the men hooted him; a hundred and twenty\r\nwent off exasperated, persisting in the resolution which he had made\r\nthem take. It was already past seven. The sun was rising brilliantly;\r\nit was a bright day of hard frost; and all at once movement began in\r\nthe pit, and the arrested labour went on. First the crank of the engine\r\nplunged, rolling and unrolling the cables on the drums. Then, in the\r\nmidst of the tumult of the signals, the descent took place. The cages\r\nfilled and were engulfed, and rose again, the shaft swallowing its\r\nration of trammers and putters and pikemen; while on the metal floors\r\nthe landers pushed the trams with a sound of thunder.\r\n\r\n"By God! What the devil are you doing there?" cried Chaval to\r\nCatherine, who was awaiting her turn. "Will you just go down and not\r\nlaze about!"\r\n\r\nAt nine o\'clock, when Madame Hennebeau arrived in her carriage with\r\nC\xc3\xa9cile, she found Lucie and Jeanne quite ready and very elegant, in\r\nspite of their dresses having been renovated for the twentieth time.\r\nBut Deneulin was surprised to see N\xc3\xa9grel accompanying the carriage on\r\nhorseback. What! were the men also in the party? Then Madame Hennebeau\r\nexplained in her maternal way that they had frightened her by saying\r\nthat the streets were full of evil faces, and so she preferred to\r\nbring a defender. N\xc3\xa9grel laughed and reassured them: nothing to cause\r\nanxiety, threats of brawlers as usual, but not one of them would dare\r\nto throw a stone at a window-pane. Still pleased with his success,\r\nDeneulin related the checked rebellion at Jean-Bart. He said that he\r\nwas now quite at rest. And on the Vandame road, while the young ladies\r\ngot into the carriage, all congratulated themselves on the superb day,\r\noblivious of the long swelling shudder of the marching people afar off\r\nin the country, though they might have heard the sound of it if they\r\nhad pressed their ears against the earth.\r\n\r\n"Well! it is agreed," repeated Madame Hennebeau. "This evening you will\r\ncall for the young ladies and dine with us. Madame Gr\xc3\xa9goire has also\r\npromised to come for C\xc3\xa9cile."\r\n\r\n"You may reckon on me," replied Deneulin.\r\n\r\nThe carriage went off towards Vandame, Jeanne and Lucie leaning down\r\nto laugh once more to their father, who was standing by the roadside;\r\nwhile N\xc3\xa9grel gallantly trotted behind the fleeing wheels.\r\n\r\nThey crossed the forest, taking the road from Vandame to Marchiennes.\r\nAs they approached Tartaret, Jeanne asked Madame Hennebeau if she knew\r\nC\xc3\xb4te-Verte, and the latter, in spite of her stay of five years in\r\nthe country, acknowledged that she had never been on that side. Then\r\nthey made a detour. Tartaret, on the outskirts of the forest, was an\r\nuncultivated moor, of volcanic sterility, under which for ages a coal\r\nmine had been burning. Its history was lost in legend. The miners of\r\nthe place said that fire from heaven had fallen on this Sodom in the\r\nbowels of the earth, where the putter-girls had committed abominations\r\ntogether, so that they had not even had the time to come to the\r\nsurface, and today were still burning at the bottom of this hell. The\r\ncalcined rocks, of a sombre red, were covered by an efflorescence of\r\nalum as by a leprosy. Sulphur grew like a yellow flower at the edge\r\nof the fissures. At night, those who were brave enough to venture to\r\nlook into these holes declared that they saw flames there, sinful\r\nsouls shrivelling in the furnace within. Wandering lights moved over\r\nthe soil, and hot vapours, the poisons from the devil\'s ordure and his\r\ndirty kitchen, were constantly smoking. And like a miracle of eternal\r\nspring, in the midst of this accursed moor of Tartaret, C\xc3\xb4te-Verte\r\nappeared, with its meadows for ever green, its beeches with leaves\r\nunceasingly renewed, its fields where three harvests ripened. It was\r\na natural hot-house, warmed by the fire in the deep strata beneath.\r\nThe snow never lay on it. The enormous bouquet of verdure, beside the\r\nleafless forest trees, blossomed on this December day, and the frost\r\nhad not even scorched the edge of it.\r\n\r\nSoon the carriage was passing over the plain. N\xc3\xa9grel joked over the\r\nlegend, and explained that a fire often occurred at the bottom of a\r\nmine from the fermentation of the coal dust; if not mastered it would\r\nburn on for ever, and he mentioned a Belgian pit which had been flooded\r\nby diverting a river and running it into the pit. But he became silent.\r\nFor the last few minutes groups of miners had been constantly passing\r\nthe carriage; they went by in silence, with sidelong looks at the\r\nluxurious equipage which forced them to stand aside. Their number went\r\non increasing. The horses were obliged to cross the little bridge over\r\nthe Scarpe at walking pace. What was going on, then, to bring all these\r\npeople into the roads? The young ladies became frightened, and N\xc3\xa9grel\r\nbegan to smell out some fray in the excited country; it was a relief\r\nwhen they at last arrived at Marchiennes. The batteries of coke ovens\r\nand the chimneys of the blast furnaces, beneath a sun which seemed to\r\nextinguish them, were belching out smoke and raining their everlasting\r\nsoot through the air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Jean-Bart, Catherine had already been at work for an hour, pushing\r\ntrams as far as the relays; and she was soaked in such a bath of\r\nperspiration that she stopped a moment to wipe her face.\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of the cutting, where he was hammering at the seam with\r\nhis mates, Chaval was astonished when he no longer heard the rumble of\r\nthe wheels. The lamps burnt badly, and the coal dust made it impossible\r\nto see.\r\n\r\n"What\'s up?" he shouted.\r\n\r\nWhen she answered that she was sure she would melt, and that her heart\r\nwas going to stop, he replied furiously:\r\n\r\n"Do like us, stupid! Take off your shift."\r\n\r\nThey were seven hundred and eight metres to the north in the first\r\npassage of the D\xc3\xa9sir\xc3\xa9e seam, which was at a distance of three\r\nkilometres from the pit-eye. When they spoke of this part of the pit,\r\nthe miners of the region grew pale, and lowered their voices, as if\r\nthey had spoken of hell; and most often they were content to shake\r\ntheir heads as men who would rather not speak of these depths of fiery\r\nfurnace. As the galleries sank towards the north, they approached\r\nTartaret, penetrating to that interior fire which calcined the rocks\r\nabove. The cuttings at the point at which they had arrived had an\r\naverage temperature of forty-five degrees. They were there in the\r\naccursed city, in the midst of the flames which the passers-by on\r\nthe plain could see through the fissures, spitting out sulphur and\r\npoisonous vapours.\r\n\r\nCatherine, who had already taken off her jacket, hesitated, then took\r\noff her trousers also; and with naked arms and naked thighs, her\r\nchemise tied round her hips by a cord like a blouse, she began to push\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n"Anyhow, that\'s better," she said aloud.\r\n\r\nIn the stifling heat she still felt a vague fear. Ever since they began\r\nworking here, five days ago, she had thought of the stories told her in\r\nchildhood, of those putter-girls of the days of old who were burning\r\nbeneath Tartaret, as a punishment for things which no one dared to\r\nrepeat. No doubt she was too big now to believe such silly stories; but\r\nstill, what would she do if she were suddenly to see coming out of the\r\nwall a girl as red as a stove, with eyes like live coals? The idea made\r\nher perspire still more.\r\n\r\nAt the relay, eighty metres from the cutting, another putter took the\r\ntram and pushed it eighty metres farther to the upbrow, so that the\r\nreceiver could forward it with the others which came down from the\r\nupper galleries.\r\n\r\n"Gracious! you\'re making yourself comfortable!" said this woman, a lean\r\nwidow of thirty, when she saw Catherine in her chemise. "I can\'t do it,\r\nthe trammers at the brow bother me with their dirty tricks."\r\n\r\n"Ah, well!" replied the young girl. "I don\'t care about the men! I feel\r\ntoo bad."\r\n\r\nShe went off again, pushing an empty tram. The worst was that in this\r\nbottom passage another cause joined with the neighbourhood of Tartaret\r\nto make the heat unbearable. They were by the side of old workings, a\r\nvery deep abandoned gallery of Gaston-Marie, where, ten years earlier,\r\nan explosion of fire-damp had set the seam alight; and it was still\r\nburning behind the clay wall which had been built there and was kept\r\nconstantly repaired, in order to limit the disaster. Deprived of air,\r\nthe fire ought to have become extinct, but no doubt unknown currents\r\nkept it alive; it had gone on for ten years, and heated the clay wall\r\nlike the bricks of an oven, so that those who passed felt half-roasted.\r\nIt was along this wall, for a length of more than a hundred metres,\r\nthat the haulage was carried on, in a temperature of sixty degrees.\r\n\r\nAfter two journeys, Catherine again felt stifled. Fortunately, the\r\npassage was large and convenient in this D\xc3\xa9sir\xc3\xa9e seam, one of the\r\nthickest in the district. The bed was one metre ninety in height, and\r\nthe men could work standing. But they would rather have worked with\r\ntwisted necks and a little fresh air.\r\n\r\n"Hallo, there! are you asleep?" said Chaval again, roughly, as soon as\r\nhe no longer heard Catherine moving. "How the devil did I come to get\r\nsuch a jade? Will you just fill your tram and push?"\r\n\r\nShe was at the bottom of the cutting, leaning on her shovel; she was\r\nfeeling ill, and she looked at them all with a foolish air without\r\nobeying. She scarcely saw them by the reddish gleam of the lamps,\r\nentirely naked like animals, so black, so encrusted in sweat and coal,\r\nthat their nakedness did not frighten her. It was a confused task,\r\nthe bending of ape-like backs, an infernal vision of scorched limbs,\r\nspending their strength amid dull blows and groans. But they could see\r\nher better, no doubt, for the picks left off hammering, and they joked\r\nher about taking off her trousers.\r\n\r\n"Eh! you\'ll catch cold; look out!"\r\n\r\n"It\'s because she\'s got such fine legs! I say, Chaval, there\'s enough\r\nthere for two."\r\n\r\n"Oh! we must see. Lift up! Higher! higher!"\r\n\r\nThen Chaval, without growing angry at these jokes, turned on her.\r\n\r\n"That\'s it, by God! Ah! she likes dirty jokes. She\'d stay there to\r\nlisten till to-morrow."\r\n\r\nCatherine had painfully decided to fill her tram, then she pushed it.\r\nThe gallery was too wide for her to get a purchase on the timber on\r\nboth sides; her naked feet were twisted in the rails where they sought\r\na point of support, while she slowly moved on, her arms stiffened in\r\nfront, and her back breaking. As soon as she came up to the clay wall,\r\nthe fiery torture again began, and the sweat fell from her whole body\r\nin enormous drops as from a storm-cloud. She had scarcely got a third\r\nof the way before she streamed, blinded, soiled also by the black mud.\r\nHer narrow chemise, as though dipped in ink, was sticking to her skin,\r\nand rising up to her waist with the movement of her thighs; it hurt her\r\nso that she had once more to stop her task.\r\n\r\nWhat was the matter with her, then, today? Never before had she felt\r\nas if there were wool in her bones. It must be the bad air. The\r\nventilation did not reach to the bottom of this distant passage. One\r\nbreathed there all sorts of vapours, which came out of the coal with\r\nthe low bubbling sound of a spring, so abundantly sometimes that\r\nthe lamps would not burn; to say nothing of fire-damp, which nobody\r\nnoticed, for from one week\'s end to the other the men were always\r\nbreathing it into their noses throughout the seam. She knew that bad\r\nair well; dead air the miners called it; the heavy asphyxiating gases\r\nbelow, above them the light gases which catch fire and blow up all the\r\nstalls of a pit, with hundreds of men, in a single burst of thunder.\r\nFrom her childhood she had swallowed so much that she was surprised she\r\nbore it so badly, with buzzing ears and burning throat.\r\n\r\nUnable to go farther, she felt the need of taking off her chemise. It\r\nwas beginning to torture her, this garment of which the least folds cut\r\nand burnt her. She resisted the longing, and tried to push again, but\r\nwas forced to stand upright. Then quickly, saying to herself that she\r\nwould cover herself at the relay, she took off everything, the cord and\r\nthe chemise, so feverishly that she would have torn off her skin if she\r\ncould. And now, naked and pitiful, brought down to the level of the\r\nfemale animal seeking its living in the mire of the streets, covered\r\nwith soot and mud up to the belly, she laboured on like a cab-hack. On\r\nall fours she pushed onwards.\r\n\r\nBut despair came; it gave her no relief to be naked. What more could\r\nshe take off? The buzzing in her ears deafened her, she seemed to feel\r\na vice gripping her temples. She fell on her knees. The lamp, wedged\r\ninto the coal in the tram, seemed to her to be going out. The intention\r\nto turn up the wick alone survived in the midst of her confused ideas.\r\nTwice she tried to examine it, and both times when she placed it before\r\nher on the earth she saw it turn pale, as though it also lacked breath.\r\nSuddenly the lamp went out. Then everything whirled around her in the\r\ndarkness; a millstone turned in her head, her heart grew weak and left\r\noff beating, numbed in its turn by the immense weariness which was\r\nputting her limbs to sleep. She had fallen back in anguish amid the\r\nasphyxiating air close to the ground.\r\n\r\n"By God! I believe she\'s lazing again," growled Chaval\'s voice.\r\n\r\nHe listened from the top of the cutting, and could hear no sound of\r\nwheels.\r\n\r\n"Eh, Catherine! you damned worm!"\r\n\r\nHis voice was lost afar in the black gallery, and not a breath replied.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll come and make you move, I will!"\r\n\r\nNothing stirred, there was only the same silence, as of death. He\r\ncame down furiously, rushing along with his lamp so violently that he\r\nnearly fell over the putter\'s body which barred the way. He looked\r\nat her in stupefaction. What was the matter, then? was it humbug, a\r\npretence of going to sleep? But the lamp which he had lowered to light\r\nup her face threatened to go out. He lifted it and lowered it afresh,\r\nand at last understood; it must be a gust of bad air. His violence\r\ndisappeared; the devotion of the miner in face of a comrade\'s peril\r\nwas awaking within him. He shouted for her chemise to be brought, and\r\nseized the naked and unconscious girl in his arms, holding her as high\r\nas possible. When their garments had been thrown over her shoulders he\r\nset out running, supporting his burden with one hand, and carrying the\r\ntwo lamps with the other. The deep galleries unrolled before him as he\r\nrushed along, turning to the right, then to the left, seeking life in\r\nthe frozen air of the plain which blew down the air-shaft. At last the\r\nsound of a spring stopped him, the trickle of water flowing from the\r\nrock. He was at a square in the great haulage gallery which formerly\r\nled to Gaston-Marie. The air here blew in like a tempest, and was so\r\nfresh that a shudder went through him as he seated himself on the earth\r\nagainst the props; his mistress was still unconscious, with closed eyes.\r\n\r\n"Catherine, come now, by God! no humbug. Hold yourself up a bit while I\r\ndip this in the water."\r\n\r\nHe was frightened to find her so limp. However, he was able to dip her\r\nchemise in the spring, and to bathe her face with it. She was like a\r\ncorpse, already buried in the depth of the earth, with her slender\r\ngirlish body which seemed to be still hesitating before swelling to\r\nthe form of puberty. Then a shudder ran over her childish breast, over\r\nthe belly and thighs of the poor little creature deflowered before her\r\ntime. She opened her eyes and stammered:\r\n\r\n"I\'m cold."\r\n\r\n"Ah! that\'s better now!" cried Chaval, relieved.\r\n\r\nHe dressed her, slipped on the chemise easily, but swore over the\r\ndifficulty he had in getting on the trousers, for she could not help\r\nmuch. She remained dazed, not understanding where she was, nor why\r\nshe was naked. When she remembered she was ashamed. How had she dared\r\nto take everything off! And she questioned him; had she been seen so,\r\nwithout even a handkerchief around her waist to cover her? He joked,\r\nand made up stories, saying that he had just brought her there in the\r\nmidst of all the mates standing in a row. What an idea, to have taken\r\nhis advice and exhibited her bum! Afterwards he declared that the mates\r\ncould not even know whether it was round or square, he had rushed along\r\nso swiftly.\r\n\r\n"The deuce! but I\'m dying of cold," he said, dressing himself in turn.\r\n\r\nNever had she seen him so kind. Usually, for one good word that he said\r\nto her she received at once two bullying ones. It would have been so\r\npleasant to live in agreement; a feeling of tenderness went through her\r\nin the languor of her fatigue. She smiled at him, and murmured:\r\n\r\n"Kiss me."\r\n\r\nHe embraced her, and lay down beside her, waiting till she was able to\r\nwalk.\r\n\r\n"You know," she said again, "you were wrong to shout at me over there,\r\nfor I couldn\'t do more, really! Even in the cutting you\'re not so hot;\r\nif you only knew how it roasts you at the bottom of the passage!"\r\n\r\n"Sure enough," he replied, "it would be better under the trees. You\r\nfeel bad in that stall, I\'m afraid, my poor girl."\r\n\r\nShe was so touched at hearing him agree with her that she tried to be\r\nbrave.\r\n\r\n"Oh! it\'s a bad place. Then, to-day the air is poisoned. But you shall\r\nsee soon if I\'m a worm. When one has to work, one works; isn\'t it true?\r\nI\'d die rather than stop."\r\n\r\nThere was silence. He held her with one arm round her waist, pressing\r\nher against his breast to keep her from harm. Although she already felt\r\nstrong enough to go back to the stall, she forgot everything in her\r\ndelight.\r\n\r\n"Only," she went on in a very low voice, "I should like it so much if\r\nyou were kinder. Yes, it is so good when we love each other a little."\r\n\r\nAnd she began to cry softly.\r\n\r\n"But I do love you," he cried, "for I\'ve taken you with me."\r\n\r\nShe only replied by shaking her head. There are often men who take\r\nwomen just in order to have them, caring mighty little about their\r\nhappiness. Her tears flowed more hotly; it made her despair now to\r\nthink of the happy life she would have led if she had chanced to fall\r\nto another lad, whose arm she would always have felt thus round her\r\nwaist. Another? and the vague image of that other arose from the depth\r\nof her emotion. But it was done with; she only desired now to live to\r\nthe end with this one, if he would not hustle her about too much.\r\n\r\n"Then," she said, "try to be like this sometimes."\r\n\r\nSobs cut short her words, and he embraced her again.\r\n\r\n"You\'re a stupid! There, I swear to be kind. I\'m not worse than any one\r\nelse, go on!"\r\n\r\nShe looked at him, and began to smile through her tears. Perhaps he\r\nwas right; one never met women who were happy. Then, although she\r\ndistrusted his oath, she gave herself up to the joy of seeing him\r\naffectionate. Good God! if only that could last! They had both embraced\r\nagain, and as they were pressing each other in a long clasp they heard\r\nsteps, which made them get up. Three mates who had seen them pass had\r\ncome up to know how she was.\r\n\r\nThey set out together. It was nearly ten o\'clock, and they took their\r\nlunch into a cool corner before going back to sweat at the bottom of\r\nthe cutting. They were finishing the double slice of bread-and-butter,\r\ntheir brick, and were about to drink the coffee from their tin, when\r\nthey were disturbed by a noise coming from stalls in the distance. What\r\nthen? was it another accident? They got up and ran. Pikemen, putters,\r\ntrammers crossed them at every step; no one knew anything; all were\r\nshouting; it must be some great misfortune. Gradually the whole mine\r\nwas in terror, frightened shadows emerged from the galleries, lanterns\r\ndanced and flew away in the darkness. Where was it? Why could no one\r\nsay?\r\n\r\nAll at once a captain passed, shouting:\r\n\r\n"They are cutting the cables! they are cutting the cables!"\r\n\r\nThen the panic increased. It was a furious gallop through the gloomy\r\npassages. Their heads were confused. Why cut the cables? And who was\r\ncutting them, when the men were below? It seemed monstrous.\r\n\r\nBut the voice of another captain was heard and then lost:\r\n\r\n"The Montsou men are cutting the cables! Let every one go up!"\r\n\r\nWhen he had understood, Chaval stopped Catherine short. The idea that\r\nhe would meet the Montsou men up above, should he get out, paralysed\r\nhis legs. It had come, then, that band which he thought had got into\r\nthe hands of the police. For a moment he thought of retracing his path\r\nand ascending through Gaston-Marie, but that was no longer possible. He\r\nswore, hesitating, hiding his fear, repeating that it was stupid to run\r\nlike that. They would not, surely, leave them at the bottom.\r\n\r\nThe captain\'s voice echoed anew, now approaching them:\r\n\r\n"Let every one go up! To the ladders! to the ladders!"\r\n\r\nAnd Chaval was carried away with his mates. He pushed Catherine and\r\naccused her of not running fast enough. Did she want, then, to remain\r\nin the pit to die of hunger? For those Montsou brigands were capable\r\nof breaking the ladders without waiting for people to come up. This\r\nabominable suggestion ended by driving them wild. Along the galleries\r\nthere was only a furious rush, helter-skelter; a race of madmen, each\r\nstriving to arrive first and mount before the others. Some men shouted\r\nthat the ladders were broken and that no one could get out. And then in\r\nfrightened groups they began to reach the pit-eye, where they were all\r\nengulfed. They threw themselves toward the shaft, they crushed through\r\nthe narrow door to the ladder passage; while an old groom who had\r\nprudently led back the horses to the stable, looked at them with an air\r\nof contemptuous indifference, accustomed to spend nights in the pit and\r\ncertain that he could eventually be drawn out of it.\r\n\r\n"By God! will you climb up in front of me?" said Chaval to Catherine.\r\n"At least I can hold you if you fall."\r\n\r\nOut of breath, and suffocated by this race of three kilometres which\r\nhad once more bathed her in sweat, she gave herself up, without\r\nunderstanding, to the eddies of the crowd. Then he pulled her by the\r\narm, almost breaking it; and she cried with pain, her tears bursting\r\nout. Already he was forgetting his oath, never would she be happy.\r\n\r\n"Go on, then!" he roared.\r\n\r\nBut he frightened her too much. If she went first he would bully her\r\nthe whole time. So she resisted, while the wild flood of their comrades\r\npushed them to one side. The water that filtered from the shaft was\r\nfalling in great drops, and the floor of the pit-eye, shaken by this\r\ntramping, was trembling over the sump, the muddy cesspool ten metres\r\ndeep. At Jean-Bart, two years earlier, a terrible accident had happened\r\njust here; the breaking of a cable had precipitated the cage to the\r\nbottom of the sump, in which two men had been drowned. And they all\r\nthought of this; every one would be left down there if they all crowded\r\non to the planks.\r\n\r\n"Confounded dunderhead!" shouted Chaval. "Die then; I shall be rid of\r\nyou!"\r\n\r\nHe climbed up and she followed.\r\n\r\nFrom the bottom to daylight there were a hundred and two ladders, about\r\nseven metres in length, each placed on a narrow landing which occupied\r\nthe breadth of the passage and in which a square hole scarcely allowed\r\nthe shoulders to pass. It was like a flat chimney, seven hundred metres\r\nin height, between the wall of the shaft and the brattice of the\r\nwinding-cage, a damp pipe, black and endless, in which the ladders were\r\nplaced one above the other, almost straight, in regular stages. It took\r\na strong man twenty-five minutes to climb up this giant column. The\r\npassage, however, was no longer used except in cases of accident.\r\n\r\nCatherine at first climbed bravely. Her naked feet were used to the\r\nhard coal on the floors of the passages, and did not suffer from the\r\nsquare rungs, covered with iron rods to prevent them from wearing\r\naway. Her hands, hardened by the haulage, grasped without fatigue the\r\nuprights that were too big for her. And it even interested her and took\r\nher out of her grief, this unforeseen ascent, this long serpent of\r\nmen flowing on and hoisting themselves up three on a ladder, so that\r\neven when the head should emerge in daylight the tail would still be\r\ntrailing over the sump. They were not there yet, the first could hardly\r\nhave ascended a third of the shaft. No one spoke now, only their feet\r\nmoved with a low sound; while the lamps, like travelling stars, spaced\r\nout from below upward, formed a continually increasing line.\r\n\r\nCatherine heard a trammer behind her counting the ladders. It gave her\r\nthe idea of counting them also. They had already mounted fifteen, and\r\nwere arriving at a landing-place. But at that moment she collided with\r\nChaval\'s legs. He swore, shouting to her to look out. Gradually the\r\nwhole column stopped and became motionless. What then? had something\r\nhappened? and every one recovered his voice to ask questions and to\r\nexpress fear. Their anxiety had increased since leaving the bottom;\r\ntheir ignorance as to what was going on above oppressed them more as\r\nthey approached daylight. Someone announced that they would have to go\r\ndown again, that the ladders were broken. That was the thought that\r\npreoccupied them all, the fear of finding themselves face to face with\r\nspace. Another explanation came down from mouth to mouth; there had\r\nbeen an accident, a pikeman slipped from a rung. No one knew exactly,\r\nthe shouts made it impossible to hear; were they going to bed there? At\r\nlast, without any precise information being obtained, the ascent began\r\nagain, with the same slow, painful movement, in the midst of the tread\r\nof feet and the dancing of lamps. It must certainly be higher up that\r\nthe ladders were broken.\r\n\r\nAt the thirty-second ladder, as they passed a third landing-stage,\r\nCatherine felt her legs and arms grow stiff. At first she had felt a\r\nslight tingling in her skin. Now she lost the sensation of the iron\r\nand the wood beneath her feet and in her hands. A vague pain, which\r\ngradually became burning, heated her muscles. And in the dizziness\r\nwhich came over her, she recalled her grandfather Bonnemort\'s stories\r\nof the days when there was no passage, and little girls of ten used to\r\ntake out the coal on their shoulders up bare ladders; so that if one\r\nof them slipped, or a fragment of coal simply rolled out of a basket,\r\nthree or four children would fall down head first from the blow. The\r\ncramp in her limbs became unbearable, she would never reach the end.\r\n\r\nFresh stoppages allowed her to breathe. But the terror which was\r\ncommunicated every time from above dazed her still more. Above and\r\nbelow her, respiration became more difficult. This interminable ascent\r\nwas causing giddiness, and the nausea affected her with the others. She\r\nwas suffocating, intoxicated with the darkness, exasperated with the\r\nwalls which crushed against her flesh, and shuddering also with the\r\ndampness, her body perspiring beneath the great drops which fell on\r\nher. They were approaching a level where so thick a rain fell that it\r\nthreatened to extinguish their lamps.\r\n\r\nChaval twice spoke to Catherine without obtaining any reply. What the\r\ndevil was she doing down there? Had she let her tongue fall? She might\r\njust tell him if she was all right. They had been climbing for half an\r\nhour, but so heavily that he had only reached the fifty-ninth ladder;\r\nthere were still forty-three. Catherine at last stammered that she was\r\ngetting on all right. He would have treated her as a worm if she had\r\nacknowledged her weariness. The iron of the rungs must have cut her\r\nfeet; it seemed to her that it was sawing in up to the bone. After\r\nevery grip she expected to see her hands leave the uprights; they were\r\nso peeled and stiff she could not close her fingers, and she feared she\r\nwould fall backward with torn shoulders and dislocated thighs in this\r\ncontinual effort. It was especially the defective slope of the ladders\r\nfrom which she suffered, the almost perpendicular position which\r\nobliged her to hoist herself up by the strength of her wrists, with her\r\nbelly against the wood. The panting of many breaths now drowned the\r\nsound of the feet, forming an enormous moan, multiplied tenfold by the\r\npartition of the passage, arising from the depths and expiring towards\r\nthe light. There was a groan; word ran along that a trammer had just\r\ncut his head open against the edge of a stair.\r\n\r\nAnd Catherine went on climbing. They had passed the level. The rain\r\nhad ceased; a mist made heavy the cellar-like air, poisoned with the\r\nodour of old iron and damp wood. Mechanically she continued to count\r\nin a low voice--eighty-one, eighty-two, eighty-three; still nineteen.\r\nThe repetition of these figures supported her merely by their rhythmic\r\nbalance; she had no further consciousness of her movements. When she\r\nlifted her eyes the lamps turned in a spiral. Her blood was flowing;\r\nshe felt that she was dying; the least breath would have knocked her\r\nover. The worst was that those below were now pushing, and that the\r\nentire column was stampeding, yielding to the growing anger of its\r\nfatigue, the furious need to see the sun again. The first mates had\r\nemerged; there were, then, no broken ladders; but the idea that they\r\nmight yet be broken to prevent the last from coming up, when others\r\nwere already breathing up above, nearly drove them mad. And when a new\r\nstoppage occurred oaths broke out, and all went on climbing, hustling\r\neach other, passing over each other\'s bodies to arrive at all costs.\r\n\r\nThen Catherine fell. She had cried Chaval\'s name in despairing appeal.\r\nHe did not hear; he was struggling, digging his heels into a comrade\'s\r\nribs to get before him. And she was rolled down and trampled over.\r\nAs she fainted she dreamed. It seemed to her that she was one of\r\nthe little putter-girls of old days, and that a fragment of coal,\r\nfallen from the basket above her, had thrown her to the bottom of the\r\nshaft, like a sparrow struck by a flint. Five ladders only remained\r\nto climb. It had taken nearly an hour. She never knew how she reached\r\ndaylight, carried up on people\'s shoulders, supported by the throttling\r\nnarrowness of the passage. Suddenly she found herself in the dazzling\r\nsunlight, in the midst of a yelling crowd who were hooting her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom early morning, before daylight, a tremor had agitated the\r\nsettlements, and that tremor was now swelling through the roads and\r\nover the whole country. But the departure had not taken place as\r\narranged, for the news had spread that cavalry and police were scouring\r\nthe plain. It was said that they had arrived from Douai during the\r\nnight, and Rasseneur was accused of having betrayed his mates by\r\nwarning M. Hennebeau; a putter even swore that she had seen the servant\r\ntaking a dispatch to the telegraph office. The miners clenched their\r\nfists and watched the soldiers from behind their shutters by the pale\r\nlight of the early morning.\r\n\r\nTowards half-past seven, as the sun was rising, another rumour\r\ncirculated, reassuring the impatient. It was a false alarm, a simple\r\nmilitary promenade, such as the general occasionally ordered since\r\nthe strike had broken out, at the desire of the prefect of Lille. The\r\nstrikers detested this official; they reproached him with deceiving\r\nthem by the promise of a conciliatory intervention, which was limited\r\nto a march of troops into Montsou every week, to overawe them. So when\r\nthe cavalry and police quietly took the road back to Marchiennes, after\r\ncontenting themselves with deafening the settlements by the stamping of\r\ntheir horses over the hard earth, the miners jeered at this innocent\r\nprefect and his soldiers who turned on their heels when things were\r\nbeginning to get hot. Up till nine o\'clock they stood peacefully about,\r\nin good humour, before their houses, following with their eyes up the\r\nstreets the meek backs of the last gendarmes. In the depths of their\r\nlarge beds the good people of Montsou were still sleeping, with their\r\nheads among the feathers. At the manager\'s house, Madame Hennebeau had\r\njust been seen setting out in the carriage, leaving M. Hennebeau at\r\nwork, no doubt, for the closed and silent villa seemed dead. Not one\r\nof the pits had any military guard; it was a fatal lack of foresight\r\nin the hour of danger, the natural stupidity which accompanies\r\ncatastrophes, the fault which a government commits whenever there is\r\nneed of precise knowledge of the facts. And nine o\'clock was striking\r\nwhen the colliers at last took the Vandame road, to repair to the\r\nrendezvous decided on the day before in the forest.\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne had very quickly perceived that he would certainly not find\r\nover at Jean-Bart the three thousand comrades on whom he was counting.\r\nMany believed that the demonstration was put off, and the worst was\r\nthat two or three bands, already on the way, would compromise the cause\r\nif he did not at all costs put himself at their head. Almost a hundred,\r\nwho had set out before daylight, were taking refuge beneath the forest\r\nbeeches, waiting for the others. Souvarine, whom the young man went\r\nup to consult, shrugged his shoulders; ten resolute fellows could do\r\nmore work than a crowd; and he turned back to the open book before\r\nhim, refusing to join in. The thing threatened to turn into sentiment\r\nwhen it would have been enough to adopt the simple method of burning\r\nMontsou. As \xc3\x89tienne left the house he saw Rasseneur, seated before the\r\nmetal stove and looking very pale, while his wife, in her everlasting\r\nblack dress, was abusing him in polite and cutting terms.\r\n\r\nMaheu was of opinion that they ought to keep their promise. A\r\nrendezvous like this was sacred. However, the night had calmed their\r\nfever; he was now fearing misfortune, and he explained that it was\r\ntheir duty to go over there to maintain their mates in the right path.\r\nMaheude approved with a nod. \xc3\x89tienne repeated complacently that it\r\nwas necessary to adopt revolutionary methods, without attempting any\r\nperson\'s life. Before setting out he refused his share of a loaf that\r\nhad been given him the evening before, together with a bottle of gin;\r\nbut he drank three little glasses, one after the other, saying that\r\nhe wanted to keep out the cold; he even carried away a tinful. Alzire\r\nwould look after the children. Old Bonnemort, whose legs were suffering\r\nfrom yesterday\'s walk, remained in bed.\r\n\r\nThey did not go away together, from motives of prudence. Jeanlin had\r\ndisappeared long ago. Maheu and Maheude went off on the side sloping\r\ntowards Montsou; while \xc3\x89tienne turned towards the forest, where he\r\nproposed to join his mates. On the way he caught up a band of women\r\namong whom he recognized Mother Brul\xc3\xa9 and the Levaque woman; as they\r\nwalked they were eating chestnuts which Mouquette had brought; they\r\nswallowed the skins so as to feel more in their stomachs. But in the\r\nforest he found no one; the men were already at Jean-Bart. He took the\r\nsame course, and arrived at the pit at the moment when Levaque and\r\nsome hundreds others were penetrating into the square. Miners were\r\ncoming up from every direction--the men by the main road, the women by\r\nthe fields, all at random, without leaders, without weapons, flowing\r\nnaturally thither like water which runs down a slope. \xc3\x89tienne perceived\r\nJeanlin, who had climbed up on a foot-bridge, installed as though at\r\na theatre. He ran faster, and entered among the first. There were\r\nscarcely three hundred of them.\r\n\r\nThere was some hesitation when Deneulin showed himself at the top of\r\nthe staircase which led to the receiving-room.\r\n\r\n"What do you want?" he asked in a loud voice.\r\n\r\nAfter having watched the disappearance of the carriage, from which\r\nhis daughters were still laughing towards him, he had returned to the\r\npit overtaken by a strange anxiety. Everything, however, was found in\r\ngood order. The men had gone down; the cage was working, and he became\r\nreassured again, and was talking to the head captain when the approach\r\nof the strikers was announced to him. He had placed himself at a window\r\nof the screening-shed; and in the face of this increasing flood which\r\nfilled the square, he at once felt his impotence. How could he defend\r\nthese buildings, open on every side? he could scarcely group some\r\ntwenty of his workmen round himself. He was lost.\r\n\r\n"What do you want?" he repeated, pale with repressed anger, making an\r\neffort to accept his disaster courageously.\r\n\r\nThere were pushes and growls amid the crowd. \xc3\x89tienne at last came\r\nforward, saying:\r\n\r\n"We do not come to injure you, sir, but work must cease everywhere."\r\n\r\nDeneulin frankly treated him as an idiot.\r\n\r\n"Do you think you will benefit me if you stop work at my place? You\r\nmight just as well fire a gun off into my back. Yes, my men are below,\r\nand they shall not come up, unless you mean to murder me first!"\r\n\r\nThese rough words raised a clamour. Maheu had to hold back Levaque,\r\nwho was pushing forward in a threatening manner, while \xc3\x89tienne went on\r\ndiscussing, and tried to convince Deneulin of the lawfulness of their\r\nrevolutionary conduct. But the latter replied by the right to work.\r\nBesides, he refused to discuss such folly; he meant to be master in his\r\nown place. His only regret was that he had not four gendarmes here to\r\nsweep away this mob.\r\n\r\n"To be sure, it is my fault; I deserve what has happened to me. With\r\nfellows of your sort force is the only argument. The Government thinks\r\nto buy you by concessions. You will throw it down, that\'s all, when it\r\nhas given you weapons."\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne was quivering, but still held himself in. He lowered his voice.\r\n\r\n"I beg you, sir, give the order for your men to come up. I cannot\r\nanswer for my mates. You may avoid a disaster."\r\n\r\n"No! be good enough to let me alone! Do I know you? You do not belong\r\nto my works, you have no quarrel with me. It is only brigands who thus\r\nscour the country to pillage houses."\r\n\r\nLoud vociferations now drowned his voice, the women especially abused\r\nhim. But he continued to hold his own, experiencing a certain relief in\r\nthis frankness with which he expressed his disciplinarian nature. Since\r\nhe was ruined in any case, he thought platitudes a useless cowardice.\r\nBut their numbers went on increasing; nearly five hundred were pushing\r\ntowards the door, and he might have been torn to pieces if his head\r\ncaptain had not pulled him violently back.\r\n\r\n"For mercy\'s sake, sir! There will be a massacre. What is the good of\r\nletting men be killed for nothing?"\r\n\r\nHe struggled and protested in one last cry thrown at the crowd:\r\n\r\n"You set of brigands, you will know what, when we are strongest again!"\r\n\r\nThey led him away; the hustling of the crowd had thrown the first ranks\r\nagainst the staircase so that the rail was twisted. It was the women\r\nwho pushed and screamed and urged on the men. The door yielded at\r\nonce; it was a door without a lock, simply closed by a latch. But the\r\nstaircase was too narrow for the pushing crowd, which would have taken\r\nlong to get in if the rear of the besiegers had not gone off to enter\r\nby other openings. Then they poured in on all sides--by the shed, the\r\nscreening-place, the boiler buildings. In less than five minutes the\r\nwhole pit belonged to them; they swarmed at every story in the midst\r\nof furious gestures and cries, carried away by their victory over this\r\nmaster who resisted.\r\n\r\nMaheu, in terror, had rushed forward among the first, saying to \xc3\x89tienne:\r\n\r\n"They must not kill him!"\r\n\r\nThe latter was already running; then, when \xc3\x89tienne understood that\r\nDeneulin had barricaded himself in the captains\' room, he replied:\r\n\r\n"Well, would it be our fault? such a madman!"\r\n\r\nHe was feeling anxious, however, being still too calm to yield to this\r\noutburst of anger. His pride of leadership also suffered on seeing the\r\nband escape from his authority and become enraged, going beyond the\r\ncold execution of the will of the people, such as he had anticipated.\r\nIn vain he called for coolness, shouting that they must not put right\r\non their enemies\' side by acts of useless destruction.\r\n\r\n"To the boilers!" shouted Mother Brul\xc3\xa9. "Put out the fires!"\r\n\r\nLevaque, who had found a file, was brandishing it like a dagger,\r\ndominating the tumult with a terrible cry:\r\n\r\n"Cut the cables! cut the cables!"\r\n\r\nSoon they all repeated this; only \xc3\x89tienne and Maheu continued to\r\nprotest, dazed, and talking in the tumult without obtaining silence. At\r\nlast the former was able to say:\r\n\r\n"But there are men below, mates!"\r\n\r\nThe noise redoubled and voices arose from all sides:\r\n\r\n"So much the worse!--Ought not to go down!--Serve the traitors\r\nright!--Yes, yes, let them stay there!--And then, they have the\r\nladders!"\r\n\r\nThen, when this idea of the ladders had made them still more obstinate,\r\n\xc3\x89tienne saw that he would have to yield. For fear of a greater disaster\r\nhe hastened towards the engine, wishing at all events to bring the\r\ncages up, so that the cables, being cut above the shaft, should not\r\nsmash them by falling down with their enormous weight. The engine-man\r\nhad disappeared as well as the few daylight workers; and he took hold\r\nof the starting lever, manipulating it while Levaque and two other\r\nclimbed up the metal scaffold which supported the pulleys. The cages\r\nwere hardly fixed on the keeps when the strident sound was heard of\r\nthe file biting into the steel. There was deep silence, and this\r\nnoise seemed to fill the whole pit; all raised their heads, looking\r\nand listening, seized by emotion. In the first rank Maheu felt a\r\nfierce joy possess him, as if the teeth of the file would deliver\r\nthem from misfortune by eating into the cable of one of these dens of\r\nwretchedness, into which they would never descend again.\r\n\r\nBut Mother Brul\xc3\xa9 had disappeared by the shed stairs still shouting:\r\n\r\n"The fires must be put out! To the boilers! to the boilers!"\r\n\r\nSome women followed her. Maheude hastened to prevent them from smashing\r\neverything, just as her husband had tried to reason with the men. She\r\nwas the calmest of them; one could demand one\'s rights without making\r\na mess in people\'s places. When she entered the boiler building the\r\nwomen were already chasing away the two stokers, and the Brul\xc3\xa9, armed\r\nwith a large shovel, and crouching down before one of the stoves,\r\nwas violently emptying it, throwing the red-hot coke on to the brick\r\nfloor, where it continued to burn with black smoke. There were ten\r\nstoves for the five boilers. Soon the women warmed to the work, the\r\nLevaque manipulating her shovel with both hands, Mouquette raising her\r\nclothes up to her thighs so as not to catch fire, all looking red in\r\nthe reflection of the flames, sweating and dishevelled in this witch\'s\r\nkitchen. The piles of coal increased, and the burning heat cracked the\r\nceiling of the vast hall.\r\n\r\n"Enough, now!" cried Maheude; "the store-room is afire."\r\n\r\n"So much the better," replied Mother Brul\xc3\xa9. "That will do the work. Ah,\r\nby God! haven\'t I said that I would pay them out for the death of my\r\nman!"\r\n\r\nAt this moment Jeanlin\'s shrill voice was heard:\r\n\r\n"Look out! I\'ll put it out, I will! I\'ll let it all off!"\r\n\r\nHe had come in among the first, and had kicked his legs about among the\r\ncrowd, delighted at the fray and seeking out what mischief he could do;\r\nthe idea had occurred to him to turn on the discharge taps and let off\r\nthe steam.\r\n\r\nThe jets came out with the violence of volleys; the five boilers were\r\nemptied with the sound of a tempest, whistling in such a roar of\r\nthunder that one\'s ears seemed to bleed. Everything had disappeared\r\nin the midst of the vapour, the hot coal grew pale, and the women\r\nwere nothing more than shadows with broken gestures. The child alone\r\nappeared mounted on the gallery, behind the whirlwinds of white steam,\r\nfilled with delight and grinning broadly in the joy of unchaining this\r\nhurricane.\r\n\r\nThis lasted nearly a quarter of an hour. A few buckets of water had\r\nbeen thrown over the heaps to complete their extinction; all danger of\r\na fire had gone by, but the anger of the crowd had not subsided; on\r\nthe contrary, it had been whipped up. Men went down with hammers, even\r\nthe women armed themselves with iron bars; and they talked of smashing\r\nboilers, of breaking engines, and of demolishing the mine.\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne, forewarned, hastened to come up with Maheu. He himself was\r\nbecoming intoxicated and carried away by this hot fever of revenge. He\r\nstruggled, however, and entreated them to be calm, now that, with cut\r\ncables, extinguished fires, and empty boilers, work was impossible.\r\nHe was not always listened to; and was again about to be carried away\r\nby the crowd, when hoots arose outside at a little low door where the\r\nladder passage emerged.\r\n\r\n"Down with the traitors!--Oh! the dirty chops of the cowards!--Down\r\nwith them! down with them!"\r\n\r\nThe men were beginning to come up from below. The first arrivals,\r\nblinded by the daylight, stood there with quivering eyelids. Then they\r\nmoved away, trying to gain the road and flee.\r\n\r\n"Down with the cowards! down with the traitors!"\r\n\r\nThe whole band of strikers had run up. In less than three minutes there\r\nwas not a man left in the buildings; the five hundred Montsou men were\r\nranged in two rows, and the Vandame men, who had had the treachery to\r\ngo down, were forced to pass between this double hedge. And as every\r\nfresh miner appeared at the door of the passage, covered with the\r\nblack mud of work and with garments in rags, the hooting redoubled,\r\nand ferocious jokes arose. Oh! look at that one!--three inches of legs\r\nand then his arse! and this one with his nose eaten by those Volcan\r\ngirls! and this other, with eyes pissing out enough wax to furnish\r\nten cathedrals! and this other, the tall fellow without a rump and as\r\nlong as Lent! An enormous putter-woman, who rolled out with her breast\r\nto her belly and her belly to her backside, raised a furious laugh.\r\nThey wanted to handle them, the joking increased and was turning to\r\ncruelty, blows would soon have rained; while the row of poor devils\r\ncame out shivering and silent beneath the abuse, with sidelong looks in\r\nexpectation of blows, glad when they could at last rush away out of the\r\nmine.\r\n\r\n"Hallo! how many are there in there?" asked \xc3\x89tienne.\r\n\r\nHe was astonished to see them still coming out, and irritated at the\r\nidea that it was not a mere handful of workers, urged by hunger,\r\nterrorized by the captains. They had lied to him, then, in the forest;\r\nnearly all Jean-Bart had gone down. But a cry escaped from him and he\r\nrushed forward when he saw Chaval standing on the threshold.\r\n\r\n"By God! is this the rendezvous you called us to?"\r\n\r\nImprecations broke out and there was a movement of the crowd towards\r\nthe traitor. What! he had sworn with them the day before, and now they\r\nfound him down below with the others! Was he, then, making fools of\r\npeople?\r\n\r\n"Off with him! To the shaft! to the shaft!"\r\n\r\nChaval, white with fear, stammered and tried to explain. But \xc3\x89tienne\r\ncut him short, carried out of himself and sharing the fury of the band.\r\n\r\n"You wanted to be in it, and you shall be in it. Come on! take your\r\ndamned snout along!"\r\n\r\nAnother clamour covered his voice. Catherine, in her turn, had just\r\nappeared, dazzled by the bright sunlight, and frightened at falling\r\ninto the midst of these savages. She was panting, with legs aching from\r\nthe hundred and two ladders, and with bleeding palms, when Maheude,\r\nseeing her, rushed forward with her hand up.\r\n\r\n"Ah! slut! you, too! When your mother is dying of hunger you betray her\r\nfor your bully!"\r\n\r\nMaheu held back her arm, and stopped the blow. But he shook his\r\ndaughter; he was enraged, like his wife; he threw her conduct in her\r\nface, and both lost their heads, shouting louder than their mates.\r\n\r\nThe sight of Catherine had completed \xc3\x89tienne\'s exasperation. He\r\nrepeated:\r\n\r\n"On we go to the other pits, and you come with us, you dirty devil!"\r\n\r\nChaval had scarcely time to get his sabots from the shed and to throw\r\nhis woollen jacket over his frozen shoulders. They all dragged him on,\r\nforcing him to run in the midst of them. Catherine, bewildered, also\r\nput on her sabots, buttoning at her neck her man\'s old jacket, with\r\nwhich she kept off the cold; and she ran behind her lover, she would\r\nnot leave him, for surely they were going to murder him.\r\n\r\nThen in two minutes Jean-Bart was emptied. Jeanlin had found a horn\r\nand was blowing it, producing hoarse sounds, as though he were\r\ngathering oxen together. The women--Mother Brul\xc3\xa9, the Levaque, and\r\nMouquette--raised their skirts to run, while Levaque, with an axe in\r\nhis hand, manipulated it like a drum-major\'s stick. Other men continued\r\nto arrive; they were nearly a thousand, without order, again flowing on\r\nto the road like a torrent let loose. The gates were too narrow, and\r\nthe palings were broken down.\r\n\r\n"To the pits!--Down with the traitors!--No more work!"\r\n\r\nAnd Jean-Bart fell suddenly into a great silence. Not a man was left,\r\nnot a breath was heard. Deneulin came out of the captains\' room, and\r\nquite alone, with a gesture forbidding any one to follow him, he went\r\nover the pit. He was pale and very calm.\r\n\r\nAt first he stopped before the shaft, lifting his eyes to look at the\r\ncut cables; the steel ends hung useless, the bite of the file had\r\nleft a living scar, a fresh wound which gleamed in the black grease.\r\nAfterwards he went up to the engine, and looked at the crank, which\r\nwas motionless, like the joint of a colossal limb struck by paralysis.\r\nHe touched the metal, which had already cooled, and the cold made him\r\nshudder as though he had touched a corpse. Then he went down to the\r\nboiler-room, walked slowly before the extinguished stoves, yawning\r\nand inundated, and struck his foot against the boilers, which sounded\r\nhollow. Well! it was quite finished; his ruin was complete. Even if he\r\nmended the cables and lit the fires, where would he find men? Another\r\nfortnight\'s strike and he would be bankrupt. And in this certainty of\r\ndisaster he no longer felt any hatred of the Montsou brigands; he felt\r\nthat all had a complicity in it, that it was a general agelong fault.\r\nThey were brutes, no doubt, but brutes who could not read, and who were\r\ndying of hunger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd the troop went off over the flat plain, white with frost beneath\r\nthe pale winter sun, and overflowed the path as they passed through the\r\nbeetroot fields.\r\n\r\nFrom the Fourche-aux-Boeufs, \xc3\x89tienne had assumed command. He cried\r\nhis orders while the crowd moved on, and organized the march. Jeanlin\r\ngalloped at the head, performing barbarous music on his horn. Then\r\nthe women came in the first ranks, some of them armed with sticks:\r\nMaheude, with wild eyes seemed to be seeking afar for the promised\r\ncity of justice, Mother Brul\xc3\xa9, the Levaque woman, Mouquette, striding\r\nalong beneath their rags, like soldiers setting out for the seat of\r\nwar. If they had any encounters, we should see if the police dared\r\nto strike women. And the men followed in a confused flock, a stream\r\nthat grew larger and larger, bristling with iron bars and dominated by\r\nLevaque\'s single axe, with its blade glistening in the sun. \xc3\x89tienne,\r\nin the middle, kept Chaval in sight, forcing him to walk before him;\r\nwhile Maheu, behind, gloomily kept an eye on Catherine, the only woman\r\namong these men, obstinately trotting near her lover for fear that he\r\nwould be hurt. Bare heads were dishevelled in the air; only the clank\r\nof sabots could be heard, like the movement of released cattle, carried\r\naway by Jeanlin\'s wild trumpeting.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly a new cry arose:\r\n\r\n"Bread! bread! bread!"\r\n\r\nIt was midday; the hunger of six weeks on strike was awaking in\r\nthese empty stomachs, whipped up by this race across the fields. The\r\nfew crusts of the morning and Mouquette\'s chestnuts had long been\r\nforgotten; their stomachs were crying out, and this suffering was added\r\nto their fury against the traitors.\r\n\r\n"To the pits! No more work! Bread!"\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne, who had refused to eat his share at the settlement, felt an\r\nunbearable tearing sensation in his chest. He made no complaint, but\r\nmechanically took his tin from time to time and swallowed a gulp of\r\ngin, shaking so much that he thought he needed it to carry him to the\r\nend. His cheeks were heated and his eyes inflamed. He kept his head,\r\nhowever, and still wished to avoid needless destruction.\r\n\r\nAs they arrived at the Joiselle road a Vandame pikeman, who had joined\r\nthe band for revenge on his master, impelled the men towards the right,\r\nshouting:\r\n\r\n"To Gaston-Marie! Must stop the pump! Let the water ruin Jean-Bart!"\r\n\r\nThe mob was already turning, in spite of the protests of \xc3\x89tienne,\r\nwho begged them to let the pumping continue. What was the good of\r\ndestroying the galleries? It offended his workman\'s heart, in spite\r\nof his resentment. Maheu also thought it unjust to take revenge on\r\na machine. But the pikeman still shouted his cry of vengeance, and\r\n\xc3\x89tienne had to cry still louder:\r\n\r\n"To Mirou! There are traitors down there! To Mirou! to Mirou!"\r\n\r\nWith a gesture, he had turned the crowd towards the left road; while\r\nJeanlin, going ahead, was blowing louder than ever. An eddy was\r\nproduced in the crowd; this time Gaston-Marie was saved.\r\n\r\nAnd the four kilometres which separated them from Mirou were traversed\r\nin half an hour, almost at running pace, across the interminable plain.\r\nThe canal on this side cut it with a long icy ribbon. The leafless\r\ntrees on the banks, changed by the frost into giant candelabra,\r\nalone broke this pale uniformity, prolonged and lost in the sky at\r\nthe horizon as in a sea. An undulation of the ground hid Montsou and\r\nMarchiennes; there was nothing but bare immensity.\r\n\r\nThey reached the pit, and found a captain standing on a foot-bridge at\r\nthe screening-shed to receive them. They all well knew Father Quandieu,\r\nthe _doyen_ of the Montsou captains, an old man whose skin and\r\nhair were quite white, and who was in his seventies, a miracle of fine\r\nhealth in the mines.\r\n\r\n"What have you come after here, you pack of meddlers?" he shouted.\r\n\r\nThe band stopped. It was no longer a master, it was a mate; and a\r\ncertain respect held them back before this old workman.\r\n\r\n"There are men down below," said \xc3\x89tienne. "Make them come up."\r\n\r\n"Yes, there are men there," said Father Quandieu, "some six dozen; the\r\nothers were afraid of you evil beggars! But I warn you that not one\r\ncomes up, or you will have to deal with me!"\r\n\r\nExclamations arose, the men pushed, the women advanced. Quickly coming\r\ndown from the foot-bridge, the captain now barred the door.\r\n\r\nThen Maheu tried to interfere.\r\n\r\n"It is our right, old man. How can we make the strike general if we\r\ndon\'t force all the mates to be on our side?"\r\n\r\nThe old man was silent a moment. Evidently his ignorance on the subject\r\nof coalition equalled the pikeman\'s. At last he replied:\r\n\r\n"It may be your right, I don\'t say. But I only know my orders. I am\r\nalone here; the men are down till three, and they shall stay there till\r\nthree."\r\n\r\nThe last words were lost in hooting. Fists were threateningly advanced,\r\nthe women deafened him, and their hot breath blew in his face. But he\r\nstill held out, his head erect, and his beard and hair white as snow;\r\nhis courage had so swollen his voice that he could be heard distinctly\r\nover the tumult.\r\n\r\n"By God! you shall not pass! As true as the sun shines, I would rather\r\ndie than let you touch the cables. Don\'t push any more, or I\'m damned\r\nif I don\'t fling myself down the shaft before you!"\r\n\r\nThe crowd drew back shuddering and impressed. He went on:\r\n\r\n"Where is the beast who does not understand that? I am only a workman\r\nlike you others. I have been told to guard here, and I\'m guarding."\r\n\r\nThat was as far as Father Quandieu\'s intelligence went, stiffened by\r\nhis obstinacy of military duty, his narrow skull, and eyes dimmed by\r\nthe black melancholy of half a century spent underground. The men\r\nlooked at him moved, feeling within them an echo of what he said, this\r\nmilitary obedience, the sense of fraternity and resignation in danger.\r\nHe saw that they were hesitating still, and repeated:\r\n\r\n"I\'m damned if I don\'t fling myself down the shaft before you!"\r\n\r\nA great recoil carried away the mob. They all turned, and in the rush\r\ntook the right-hand road, which stretched far away through the fields.\r\nAgain cries arose:\r\n\r\n"To Madeleine! To Cr\xc3\xa9vecoeur! no more work! Bread! bread!"\r\n\r\nBut in the centre, as they went on, there was hustling. It was Chaval,\r\nthey said, who was trying to take advantage of an opportunity to\r\nescape. \xc3\x89tienne had seized him by the arm, threatening to do for him if\r\nhe was planning some treachery. And the other struggled and protested\r\nfuriously:\r\n\r\n"What\'s all this for? Isn\'t a man free? I\'ve been freezing the last\r\nhour. I want to clean myself. Let me go!"\r\n\r\nHe was, in fact, suffering from the coal glued to his skin by sweat,\r\nand his woollen garment was no protection.\r\n\r\n"On you go, or we\'ll clean you," replied \xc3\x89tienne. "Don\'t expect to get\r\nyour life at a bargain."\r\n\r\nThey were still running, and he turned towards Catherine, who was\r\nkeeping up well. It annoyed him to feel her so near him, so miserable,\r\nshivering beneath her man\'s old jacket and her muddy trousers. She must\r\nbe nearly dead of fatigue, she was running all the same.\r\n\r\n"You can go off, you can," he said at last.\r\n\r\nCatherine seemed not to hear. Her eyes, on meeting \xc3\x89tienne\'s, only\r\nflamed with reproach for a moment. She did not stop. Why did he want\r\nher to leave her man? Chaval was not at all kind, it was true; he\r\nwould even beat her sometimes. But he was her man, the one who had had\r\nher first; and it enraged her that they should throw themselves on\r\nhim--more than a thousand of them. She would have defended him without\r\nany tenderness at all, out of pride.\r\n\r\n"Off you go!" repeated Maheu, violently.\r\n\r\nHer father\'s order slackened her course for a moment. She trembled, and\r\nher eyelids swelled with tears. Then, in spite of her fear, she came\r\nback to the same place again, still running. Then they let her be.\r\n\r\nThe mob crossed the Joiselle road, went a short distance up the Cron\r\nroad and then mounted towards Cougny. On this side, factory chimneys\r\nstriped the flat horizon; wooden sheds, brick workshops with large\r\ndusty windows, appeared along the street. They passed one after another\r\nthe low buildings of two settlements--that of the Cent-Quatre-Vingts,\r\nthen that of the Soixante-Seize; and from each of them, at the sound of\r\nthe horn and the clamour arising from every mouth, whole families came\r\nout--men, women, and children--running to join their mates in the rear.\r\nWhen they came up to Madeleine there were at least fifteen hundred. The\r\nroad descended in a gentle slope; the rumbling flood of strikers had to\r\nturn round the pit-bank before they could spread over the mine square.\r\n\r\nIt was now not more than two o\'clock. But the captains had been warned\r\nand were hastening the ascent as the band arrived. The men were all\r\nup, only some twenty remained and were now disembarking from the cage.\r\nThey fled and were pursued with stones. Two were struck, another left\r\nthe sleeve of his jacket behind. This man-hunt saved the material, and\r\nneither the cables nor the boilers were touched. The flood was already\r\nmoving away, rolling on towards the next pit.\r\n\r\nThis one, Cr\xc3\xa9vecoeur, was only five hundred metres away from Madeleine.\r\nThere, also, the mob arrived in the midst of the ascent. A putter-girl\r\nwas taken and whipped by the women with her breeches split open and\r\nher buttocks exposed before the laughing men. The trammer-boys had\r\ntheir ears boxed, the pikemen got away, their sides blue from blows\r\nand their noses bleeding. And in this growing ferocity, in this old\r\nneed of revenge which was turning every head with madness, the choked\r\ncries went on, death to traitors, hatred against ill-paid work, the\r\nroaring of bellies after bread. They began to cut the cables, but the\r\nfile would not bite, and the task was too long now that the fever was\r\non them for moving onward, for ever onward. At the boilers a tap was\r\nbroken; while the water, thrown by bucketsful into the stoves, made the\r\nmetal gratings burst.\r\n\r\nOutside they were talking of marching on Saint-Thomas. This was the\r\nbest disciplined pit. The strike had not touched it, nearly seven\r\nhundred men must have gone down there. This exasperated them; they\r\nwould wait for these men with sticks, ranged for battle, just to see\r\nwho would get the best of it. But the rumour ran along that there were\r\ngendarmes at Saint-Thomas, the gendarmes of the morning whom they had\r\nmade fun of. How was this known? nobody could say. No matter! they\r\nwere seized by fear and decided on Feutry-Cantel. Their giddiness\r\ncarried them on, all were on the road, clanking their sabots, rushing\r\nforward. To Feutry-Cantel! to Feutry-Cantel! The cowards there were\r\ncertainly four hundred in number and there would be fun! Situated three\r\nkilometres away, this pit lay in a fold of the ground near the Scarpe.\r\nThey were already climbing the slope of the Platri\xc3\xa9res, beyond the road\r\nto Beaugnies, when a voice, no one knew from whom, threw out the idea\r\nthat the soldiers were, perhaps, down there at Feutry-Cantel. Then from\r\none to the other of the column it was repeated that the soldiers were\r\ndown there. They slackened their march, panic gradually spread in the\r\ncountry, idle without work, which they had been scouring for hours. Why\r\nhad they not come across any soldiers? This impunity troubled them, at\r\nthe thought of the repression which they felt to be coming.\r\n\r\nWithout any one knowing where it came from, a new word of command\r\nturned them towards another pit.\r\n\r\n"To the Victoire! to the Victoire!"\r\n\r\nWere there, then, neither soldiers nor police at the Victoire? Nobody\r\nknew. All seemed reassured. And turning round they descended from the\r\nBeaumont side and cut across the fields to reach the Joiselle road. The\r\nrailway line barred their passage, and they crossed it, pulling down\r\nthe palings. Now they were approaching Montsou, the gradual undulation\r\nof the landscape grew less, the sea of beetroot fields enlarged,\r\nreaching far away to the black houses at Marchiennes.\r\n\r\nThis time it was a march of five good kilometres. So strong an impulse\r\npushed them on that they had no feeling of their terrible fatigue, or\r\nof their bruised and wounded feet. The rear continued to lengthen,\r\nincreased by mates enlisted on the roads and in the settlements. When\r\nthey had passed the canal at the Magache bridge, and appeared before\r\nthe Victoire, there were two thousand of them. But three o\'clock had\r\nstruck, the ascent was completed, not a man remained below. Their\r\ndisappointment was spent in vain threats; they could only heave\r\nbroken bricks at the workmen who had arrived to take their duty at\r\nthe earth-cutting. There was a rush, and the deserted pit belonged to\r\nthem. And in their rage at not finding a traitor\'s face to strike,\r\nthey attacked things. A rankling abscess was bursting within them, a\r\npoisoned boil of slow growth. Years and years of hunger tortured them\r\nwith a thirst for massacre and destruction. Behind a shed \xc3\x89tienne saw\r\nsome porters filling a wagon with coal.\r\n\r\n"Will you just clear out of the bloody place!" he shouted. "Not a bit\r\nof coal goes out!"\r\n\r\nAt his orders some hundred strikers ran up, and the porters only had\r\ntime to escape. Men unharnessed the horses, which were frightened and\r\nset off, struck in the haunches; while others, overturning the wagon,\r\nbroke the shafts.\r\n\r\nLevaque, with violent blows of his axe, had thrown himself on the\r\nplatforms to break down the foot-bridges. They resisted, and it\r\noccurred to him to tear up the rails, destroying the line from one\r\nend of the square to the other. Soon the whole band set to this task.\r\nMaheu made the metal chairs leap up, armed with his iron bar which\r\nhe used as a lever. During this time Mother Brul\xc3\xa9 led away the women\r\nand invaded the lamp cabin, where their sticks covered the soil with\r\na carnage of lamps. Maheude, carried out of herself, was laying about\r\nher as vigorously as the Levaque woman. All were soaked in oil, and\r\nMouquette dried her hands on her skirt, laughing to find herself so\r\ndirty. Jeanlin for a joke, had emptied a lamp down her neck. But all\r\nthis revenge produced nothing to eat. Stomachs were crying out louder\r\nthan ever. And the great lamentation dominated still:\r\n\r\n"Bread! bread! bread!"\r\n\r\nA former captain at the Victoire kept a stall near by. No doubt he had\r\nfled in fear, for his shed was abandoned. When the women came back, and\r\nthe men had finished destroying the railway, they besieged the stall,\r\nthe shutters of which yielded at once. They found no bread there; there\r\nwere only two pieces of raw flesh and a sack of potatoes. But in the\r\npillage they discovered some fifty bottles of gin, which disappeared\r\nlike a drop of water drunk up by the sand.\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne, having emptied his tin, was able to refill it. Little by\r\nlittle a terrible drunkenness, the drunkenness of the starved, was\r\ninflaming his eyes and baring his teeth like a wolf\'s between his\r\npallid lips. Suddenly he perceived that Chaval had gone off in the\r\nmidst of the tumult. He swore, and men ran to seize the fugitive, who\r\nwas hiding with Catherine behind the timber supply.\r\n\r\n"Ah! you dirty swine; you are afraid of getting into trouble!" shouted\r\n\xc3\x89tienne. "It was you in the forest who called for a strike of the\r\nengine-men, to stop the pumps, and now you want to play us a filthy\r\ntrick! Very well! By God! we will go back to Gaston-Marie. I will have\r\nyou smash the pump; yes, by God! you shall smash it!"\r\n\r\nHe was drunk; he was urging his men against this pump which he had\r\nsaved a few hours earlier.\r\n\r\n"To Gaston-Marie! to Gaston-Marie!"\r\n\r\nThey all cheered, and rushed on, while Chaval, seized by the shoulders,\r\nwas drawn and pushed violently along, while he constantly asked to be\r\nallowed to wash.\r\n\r\n"Will you take yourself off, then?" cried Maheu to Catherine who had\r\nalso begun to run again.\r\n\r\nThis time she did not even draw back, but turned her burning eyes on\r\nher father, and went on running.\r\n\r\nOnce more the mob ploughed through the flat plain. They were retracing\r\ntheir steps over the long straight paths, by the fields endlessly\r\nspread out. It was four o\'clock; the sun which approached the horizon,\r\nlengthened the shadows of this horde with their furious gestures over\r\nthe frozen soil.\r\n\r\nThey avoided Montsou, and farther on rejoined the Joiselle road; to\r\nspare the journey round Fourche-aux-Boeufs, they passed beneath the\r\nwalls of Piolaine. The Gr\xc3\xa9goires had just gone out, having to visit a\r\nlawyer before going to dine with the Hennebeaus, where they would find\r\nC\xc3\xa9cile. The estate seemed asleep, with its avenue of deserted limes,\r\nits kitchen garden and its orchard bared by the winter. Nothing was\r\nstirring in the house, and the closed windows were dulled by the warm\r\nsteam within. Out of the profound silence an impression of good-natured\r\ncomfort arose, the patriarchal sensation of good beds and a good table,\r\nthe wise happiness of the proprietor\'s existence.\r\n\r\nWithout stopping, the band cast gloomy looks through the grating and at\r\nthe length of protecting walls, bristling with broken bottles. The cry\r\narose again:\r\n\r\n"Bread! bread! bread!"\r\n\r\nThe dogs alone replied, by barking ferociously, a pair of Great Danes,\r\nwith rough coats, who stood with open jaws. And behind the closed\r\nblind there were only the servants. M\xc3\xa9lanie the cook and Honorine\r\nthe housemaid, attracted by this cry, pale and perspiring with fear\r\nat seeing these savages go by. They fell on their knees, and thought\r\nthemselves killed on hearing a single stone breaking a pane of a\r\nneighbouring window. It was a joke of Jeanlin\'s; he had manufactured a\r\nsling with a piece of cord, and had just sent a little passing greeting\r\nto the Gr\xc3\xa9goires. Already he was again blowing his horn, the band was\r\nlost in the distance, and the cry grew fainter:\r\n\r\n"Bread! bread! bread!"\r\n\r\nThey arrived at Gaston-Marie in still greater numbers, more than two\r\nthousand five hundred madmen, breaking everything, sweeping away\r\neverything, with the force of a torrent which gains strength as it\r\nmoves. The police had passed here an hour earlier, and had gone off\r\ntowards Saint-Thomas, led astray by some peasants; in their haste they\r\nhad not even taken the precaution of leaving a few men behind to guard\r\nthe pit. In less than a quarter of an hour the fires were overturned,\r\nthe boilers emptied, the buildings torn down and devastated. But it was\r\nthe pump which they specially threatened. It was not enough to stop it\r\nin the last expiring breath of its steam; they threw themselves on it\r\nas on a living person whose life they required.\r\n\r\n"The first blow is yours!" repeated \xc3\x89tienne, putting a hammer into\r\nChaval\'s hand. "Come! you have sworn with the others!"\r\n\r\nChaval drew back trembling, and in the hustling the hammer fell; while\r\nother men, without waiting, battered the pump with blows from iron\r\nbars, blows from bricks, blows from anything they could lay their hands\r\non. Some even broke sticks over it. The nuts leapt off, the pieces of\r\nsteel and copper were dislocated like torn limbs. The blow of a shovel,\r\ndelivered with full force, fractured the metal body; the water escaped\r\nand emptied itself, and there was a supreme gurgle like an agonizing\r\ndeath-rattle.\r\n\r\nThat was the end, and the mob found themselves outside again, madly\r\npushing on behind \xc3\x89tienne, who would not let Chaval go.\r\n\r\n"Kill him! the traitor! To the shaft! to the shaft!"\r\n\r\nThe livid wretch, clinging with imbecile obstinacy to his fixed idea,\r\ncontinued to stammer his need of cleaning himself.\r\n\r\n"Wait, if that bothers you, said the Levaque woman. "Here! here\'s a\r\nbucket!"\r\n\r\nThere was a pond there, an infiltration of the water from the pump. It\r\nwas white with a thick layer of ice; and they struck it and broke the\r\nice, forcing him to dip his head in this cold water.\r\n\r\n"Duck then," repeated Mother Brul\xc3\xa9. "By God! if you don\'t duck we\'ll\r\nshove you in. And now you shall have a drink of it; yes, yes, like a\r\nbeast, with your jaws in the trough!"\r\n\r\nHe had to drink on all fours. They all laughed, with cruel laughter.\r\nOne woman pulled his ears, another woman threw in his face a handful\r\nof dung found fresh on the road. His old woollen jacket in tatters no\r\nlonger held together. He was haggard, stumbling, and with struggling\r\nmovements of his hips he tried to flee.\r\n\r\nMaheu had pushed him, and Maheude was among those who grew furious,\r\nboth of them satisfying their old spite; even Mouquette, who generally\r\nremained such good friends with her old lovers, was wild with this one,\r\ntreating him as a good-for-nothing, and talking of taking his breeches\r\ndown to see if he was still a man.\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne made her hold her tongue.\r\n\r\n"That\'s enough. There\'s no need for all to set to it. If you like, you,\r\nwe will just settle it together."\r\n\r\nHis fists closed and his eyes were lit up with homicidal fury; his\r\nintoxication was turning into the desire to kill.\r\n\r\n"Are you ready? One of us must stay here. Give him a knife; I\'ve got\r\nmine."\r\n\r\nCatherine, exhausted and terrified, gazed at him. She remembered his\r\nconfidences, his desire to devour a man when he had drunk, poisoned\r\nafter the third glass, to such an extent had his drunkards of parents\r\nput this beastliness into his body. Suddenly she leapt forward, struck\r\nhim with both her woman\'s hands, and choking with indignation shouted\r\ninto his face:\r\n\r\n"Coward! coward! coward! Isn\'t it enough, then, all these abominations?\r\nYou want to kill him now that he can\'t stand upright any longer!"\r\n\r\nShe turned towards her father and her mother; she turned towards the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n"You are cowards! cowards! Kill me, then, with him! I will tear your\r\neyes out, I will, if you touch him again. Oh! the cowards!"\r\n\r\nAnd she planted herself before her man to defend him, forgetting the\r\nblows, forgetting the life of misery, lifted up by the idea that she\r\nbelonged to him since he had taken her, and that it was a shame for her\r\nwhen they so crushed him.\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne had grown pale beneath this girl\'s blows. At first he had\r\nbeen about to knock her down; then, after having wiped his face with\r\nthe movement of a man who is recovering from intoxication, he said to\r\nChaval, in the midst of deep silence:\r\n\r\n"She is right; that\'s enough. Off you go."\r\n\r\nImmediately Chaval was away, and Catherine galloped behind him. The\r\ncrowd gazed at them as they disappeared round a corner of the road; but\r\nMaheude muttered:\r\n\r\n"You were wrong; ought to have kept him. He is sure to be after some\r\ntreachery."\r\n\r\nBut the mob began to march on again. Five o\'clock was about to strike.\r\nThe sun, as red as a furnace on the edge of the horizon, seemed to\r\nset fire to the whole plain. A pedlar who was passing informed them\r\nthat the military were descending from the Cr\xc3\xa9vecoeur side. Then they\r\nturned. An order ran:\r\n\r\n"To Montsou! To the manager!--Bread! bread! bread!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\nM. Hennebeau had placed himself in front of his study window to watch\r\nthe departure of the carriage which was taking away his wife to\r\nlunch at Marchiennes. His eyes followed N\xc3\xa9grel for a moment, as he\r\ntrotted beside the carriage door. Then he quietly returned and seated\r\nhimself at his desk. When neither his wife nor his nephew animated\r\nthe place with their presence the house seemed empty. On this day the\r\ncoachman was driving his wife; Rose, the new housemaid, had leave to\r\ngo out till five o\'clock; there only remained Hippolyte, the valet de\r\nchambre, trailing about the rooms in slippers, and the cook, who had\r\nbeen occupied since dawn in struggling with her saucepans, entirely\r\nabsorbed in the dinner which was to be given in the evening. So M.\r\nHennebeau promised himself a day of serious work in this deep calm of\r\nthe deserted house.\r\n\r\nTowards nine o\'clock, although he had received orders to send every\r\none away, Hippolyte took the liberty of announcing Dansaert, who\r\nwas bringing news. The manager then heard, for the first time, of\r\nthe meeting in the forest the evening before; the details were very\r\nprecise, and he listened while thinking of the intrigue with Pierronne,\r\nso well known that two or three anonymous letters every week denounced\r\nthe licentiousness of the head captain. Evidently the husband had\r\ntalked, and no doubt the wife had, too. He even took advantage of the\r\noccasion; he let the head captain know that he was aware of everything,\r\ncontenting himself with recommending prudence for fear of a scandal.\r\nStartled by these reproaches in the midst of his report, Dansaert\r\ndenied, stammered excuses, while his great nose confessed the crime\r\nby its sudden redness. He did not insist, however, glad to get off so\r\neasily; for, as a rule, the manager displayed the implacable severity\r\nof the virtuous man whenever an employee allowed himself the indulgence\r\nof a pretty girl in the pit. The conversation continued concerning the\r\nstrike; that meeting in the forest was only the swagger of blusterers;\r\nnothing serious threatened. In any case, the settlements would surely\r\nnot stir for some days, beneath the impression of respectful fear which\r\nmust have been produced by the military promenade of the morning.\r\n\r\nWhen M. Hennebeau was alone again he was, however, on the point of\r\nsending a telegram to the prefect. Only the fear of uselessly showing\r\na sign of anxiety held him back. Already he could not forgive himself\r\nhis lack of insight in saying everywhere, and even writing to the\r\ndirectors, that the strike would last at most a fortnight. It had\r\nbeen going on and on for nearly two months, to his great surprise,\r\nand he was in despair over it; he felt himself every day lowered and\r\ncompromised, and was forced to imagine some brilliant achievement\r\nwhich would bring him back into favour with the directors. He had just\r\nasked them for orders in the case of a skirmish. There was delay over\r\nthe reply, and he was expecting it by the afternoon post. He said to\r\nhimself that there would be time then to send out telegrams, and to\r\nobtain the military occupation of the pits, if such was the desire of\r\nthose gentlemen. In his own opinion there would certainly be a battle\r\nand an expenditure of blood. This responsibility troubled him in spite\r\nof his habitual energy.\r\n\r\nUp to eleven o\'clock he worked peacefully; there was no sound in the\r\ndead house except Hippolyte\'s waxing-stick, which was rubbing a floor\r\nfar away on the first floor. Then, one after the other, he received two\r\nmessages, the first announcing the attack on Jean-Bart by the Montsou\r\nband, the second telling of the cut cables, the overturned fires, and\r\nall the destruction. He could not understand. Why had the strikers gone\r\nto Deneulin instead of attacking one of the Company\'s pits? Besides,\r\nthey were quite welcome to sack Vandame; that would merely ripen the\r\nplan of conquest which he was meditating. And at midday he lunched\r\nalone in the large dining-room, served so quietly by the servant\r\nthat he could not even hear his slippers. This solitude rendered his\r\npreoccupations more gloomy; he was feeling cold at the heart when a\r\ncaptain, who had arrived running, was shown in, and told him of the\r\nmob\'s march on Mirou. Almost immediately, as he was finishing his\r\ncoffee, a telegram informed him that Madeleine and Cr\xc3\xa9vecoeur were\r\nin their turn threatened. Then his perplexity became extreme. He was\r\nexpecting the postman at two o\'clock; ought he at once to ask for\r\ntroops? or would it be better to wait patiently, and not to act until\r\nhe had received the directors\' orders? He went back into his study;\r\nhe wished to read a report which he had asked N\xc3\xa9grel to prepare the\r\nday before for the prefect. But he could not put his hand on it; he\r\nreflected that perhaps the young man had left it in his room, where he\r\noften wrote at night, and without taking any decision, pursued by the\r\nidea of this report, he went upstairs to look for it in the room.\r\n\r\nAs he entered, M. Hennebeau was surprised: the room had not been done,\r\nno doubt through Hippolyte\'s forgetfulness or laziness. There was a\r\nmoist heat there, the close heat of the past night, made heavier from\r\nthe mouth of the hot-air stove being left open; and he was suffocated,\r\ntoo, with a penetrating perfume, which he thought must be the odour\r\nof the toilet waters with which the basin was full. There was great\r\ndisorder in the room--garments scattered about, damp towels thrown\r\non the backs of chairs, the bed yawning, with a sheet drawn back and\r\ndraggling on the carpet. But at first he only glanced round with an\r\nabstracted look as he went towards a table covered with papers to look\r\nfor the missing report. Twice he examined the papers one by one, but it\r\nwas certainly not there. Where the devil could that madcap Paul have\r\nstuffed it?\r\n\r\nAnd as M. Hennebeau went back into the middle of the room, giving a\r\nglance at each article of furniture, he noticed in the open bed a\r\nbright point which shone like a star. He approached mechanically and\r\nput out his hand. It was a little gold scent-bottle lying between two\r\nfolds of the sheet. He at once recognized a scent-bottle belonging to\r\nMadame Hennebeau, the little ether bottle which was always with her.\r\nBut he could not understand its presence here: how could it have got\r\ninto Paul\'s bed? And suddenly he grew terribly pale. His wife had slept\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n"Beg your pardon, sir," murmured Hippolyte\'s voice through the door. "I\r\nsaw you going up."\r\n\r\nThe servant entered and was thrown into consternation by the disorder.\r\n\r\n"Lord! Why, the room is not done! So Rose has gone out, leaving all the\r\nhouse on my shoulders!"\r\n\r\nM. Hennebeau had hidden the bottle in his hand and was pressing it\r\nalmost to breaking.\r\n\r\n"What do you want?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s another man, sir; he has come from Cr\xc3\xa9vecoeur with a letter."\r\n\r\n"Good! Leave me alone; tell him to wait."\r\n\r\nHis wife had slept there! When he had bolted the door he opened his\r\nhand again and looked at the little bottle which had left its image in\r\nred on his flesh. Suddenly he saw and understood; this filthiness had\r\nbeen going on in his house for months. He recalled his old suspicion,\r\nthe rustling against the doors, the naked feet at night through the\r\nsilent house. Yes, it was his wife who went up to sleep there!\r\n\r\nFalling into a chair opposite the bed, which he gazed at fixedly,\r\nhe remained some minutes as though crushed. A noise aroused him;\r\nsomeone was knocking at the door, trying to open it. He recognized the\r\nservant\'s voice.\r\n\r\n"Sir--Ah! you are shut in, sir."\r\n\r\n"What is it now?"\r\n\r\n"There seems to be a hurry; the men are breaking everything. There are\r\ntwo more messengers below. There are also some telegrams."\r\n\r\n"You just leave me alone! I am coming directly."\r\n\r\nThe idea that Hippolyte would himself have discovered the scent-bottle,\r\nhad he done the room in the morning, had just frozen him. And besides,\r\nthis man must know; he must have found the bed still hot with adultery\r\ntwenty times over, with madame\'s hairs trailing on the pillow, and\r\nabominable traces staining the linen. The man kept interrupting him,\r\nand it could only be out of inquisitiveness. Perhaps he had stayed with\r\nhis ear stuck to the door, excited by the debauchery of his masters.\r\n\r\nM. Hennebeau did not move. He still gazed at the bed. His long past\r\nof suffering unrolled before him: his marriage with this woman, their\r\nimmediate misunderstanding of the heart and of the flesh, the lovers\r\nwhom she had had unknown to him, and the lover whom he had tolerated\r\nfor ten years, as one tolerates an impure taste in a sick woman. Then\r\ncame their arrival at Montsou, the mad hope of curing her, months\r\nof languor, of sleepy exile, the approach of old age which would,\r\nperhaps, at last give her back to him. Then their nephew arrived, this\r\nPaul to whom she became a mother, and to whom she spoke of her dead\r\nheart buried for ever beneath the ashes. And he, the imbecile husband,\r\nforesaw nothing; he adored this woman who was his wife, whom other men\r\nhad possessed, but whom he alone could not possess! He adored her with\r\nshameful passion, so that he would have fallen on his knees if she\r\nwould but have given him the leavings of other men! The leavings of the\r\nothers she gave to this child.\r\n\r\nThe sound of a distant gong at this moment made M. Hennebeau start. He\r\nrecognized it; it was struck, by his orders, when the postman arrived.\r\nHe rose and spoke aloud, breaking into the flood of coarseness with\r\nwhich his parched throat was bursting in spite of himself.\r\n\r\n"Ah! I don\'t care a bloody hang for their telegrams and their letters!\r\nnot a bloody hang!"\r\n\r\nNow he was carried away by rage, the need of some sewer in which to\r\nstamp down all this filthiness with his heels. This woman was a vulgar\r\ndrab; he sought for crude words and buffeted her image with them. The\r\nsudden idea of the marriage between C\xc3\xa9cile and Paul, which she was\r\narranging with so quiet a smile, completed his exasperation. There\r\nwas, then, not even passion, not even jealousy at the bottom of this\r\npersistent sensuality? It was now a perverse plaything, the habit of\r\nthe woman, a recreation taken like an accustomed dessert. And he put\r\nall the responsibility on her, he regarded as almost innocent the lad\r\nat whom she had bitten in this reawakening of appetite, just as one\r\nbites at an early green fruit, stolen by the wayside. Whom would she\r\ndevour, on whom would she fall, when she no longer had complaisant\r\nnephews, sufficiently practical to accept in their own family the\r\ntable, the bed, and the wife?\r\n\r\nThere was a timid scratch at the door, and Hippolyte allowed himself to\r\nwhisper through the keyhole:\r\n\r\n"The postman, sir. And Monsieur Dansaert, too, has come back, saying\r\nthat they are killing one another."\r\n\r\n"I\'m coming down, good God!"\r\n\r\nWhat should he do to them? Chase them away on their return from\r\nMarchiennes, like stinking animals whom he would no longer have\r\nbeneath his roof? He would take a cudgel, and would tell them to carry\r\nelsewhere their poisonous coupling. It was with their sighs, with their\r\nmixed breaths, that the damp warmth of this room had grown heavy;\r\nthe penetrating odour which had suffocated him was the odour of musk\r\nwhich his wife\'s skin exhaled, another perverse taste, a fleshly need\r\nof violent perfumes; and he seemed to feel also the heat and odour of\r\nfornication, of living adultery, in the pots which lay about, in the\r\nbasins still full, in the disorder of the linen, of the furniture,\r\nof the entire room tainted with vice. The fury of impotence threw\r\nhim on to the bed, which he struck with his fists, belabouring the\r\nplaces where he saw the imprint of their two bodies, enraged with the\r\ndisordered coverlets and the crumpled sheets, soft and inert beneath\r\nhis blows, as though exhausted themselves by the embraces of the whole\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly he thought he heard Hippolyte coming up again. He was\r\narrested by shame. For a moment he stood panting, wiping his forehead,\r\ncalming the bounds of his heart. Standing before a mirror he looked at\r\nhis face, so changed that he did not recognize himself. Then, when he\r\nhad watched it gradually grow calmer by an effort of supreme will, he\r\nwent downstairs.\r\n\r\nFive messengers were standing below, not counting Dansaert. All brought\r\nhim news of increasing gravity concerning the march of the strikers\r\namong the pits: and the chief captain told him at length what had gone\r\non at Mirou and the fine behaviour of Father Quandieu. He listened,\r\nnodding his head, but he did not hear; his thoughts were in the room\r\nupstairs. At last he sent them away, saying that he would take due\r\nmeasures. When he was alone again, seated before his desk, he seemed\r\nto grow drowsy, with his head between his hands, covering his eyes.\r\nHis mail was there, and he decided to look for the expected letter,\r\nthe directors\' reply. The lines at first danced before him, but he\r\nunderstood at last that these gentlemen desired a skirmish; certainly\r\nthey did not order him to make things worse, but they allowed it to be\r\nseen that disturbances would hasten the conclusion of the strike by\r\nprovoking energetic repression. After this, he no longer hesitated, but\r\nsent off telegrams on all sides--to the prefect of Lille, to the corps\r\nof soldiery at Douai, to the police at Marchiennes. It was a relief; he\r\nhad nothing to do but shut himself in; he even spread the report that\r\nhe was suffering from gout. And all the afternoon he hid himself in his\r\nstudy, receiving no one, contenting himself with reading the telegrams\r\nand letters which continued to rain in. He thus followed the mob from\r\nafar, from Madeleine to Cr\xc3\xa9vecoeur, from Cr\xc3\xa9vecoeur to the Victoire,\r\nfrom the Victoire to Gaston-Marie. Information also reached him of the\r\nbewilderment of the police and the troops, wandering along the roads,\r\nand always with their backs to the pit attacked. They might kill one\r\nanother, and destroy everything! He put his head between his hands\r\nagain, with his fingers over his eyes, and buried himself in the deep\r\nsilence of the empty house, where he only heard now and then the noise\r\nof the cook\'s saucepans as she bustled about preparing the evening\'s\r\ndinner.\r\n\r\nThe twilight was already darkening the room; it was five o\'clock when a\r\ndisturbance made M. Hennebeau jump, as he sat dazed and inert with his\r\nelbows in his papers. He thought that it was the two wretches coming\r\nback. But the tumult increased, and a terrible cry broke out just as he\r\nwas going to the window:\r\n\r\n"Bread! bread! bread!"\r\n\r\nIt was the strikers, now invading Montsou, while the police, expecting\r\nan attack on the Voreux, were galloping off in the opposite direction\r\nto occupy that pit.\r\n\r\nJust then, two kilometres away from the first houses, a little beyond\r\nthe crossways where the main road cut the Vandame road, Madame\r\nHennebeau and the young ladies had witnessed the passing of the mob.\r\nThe day had been spent pleasantly at Marchiennes; there had been a\r\ndelightful lunch with the manager of the Forges, then an interesting\r\nvisit to the workshops and to the neighbouring glass works to occupy\r\nthe afternoon; and as they were now going home in the limpid decline\r\nof the beautiful winter day, C\xc3\xa9cile had had the whim to drink a glass\r\nof milk, as she noticed a little farm near the edge of the road. They\r\nall then got down from the carriage, and N\xc3\xa9grel gallantly leapt off\r\nhis horse; while the peasant-woman, alarmed by all these fine people,\r\nrushed about, and spoke of laying a cloth before serving the milk. But\r\nLucie and Jeanne wanted to see the cow milked, and they went into the\r\ncattle-shed with their cups, making a little rural party, and laughing\r\ngreatly at the litter in which one sank.\r\n\r\nMadame Hennebeau, with her complacent maternal air, was drinking\r\nwith the edge of her lips, when a strange roaring noise from without\r\ndisturbed her.\r\n\r\n"What is that, then?"\r\n\r\nThe cattle-shed, built at the edge of the road, had a large door for\r\ncarts, for it was also used as a barn for hay. The young girls, who had\r\nput out their heads, were astonished to see on the left a black flood,\r\na shouting band which was moving along the Vandame road.\r\n\r\n"The deuce!" muttered N\xc3\xa9grel, who had also gone out. "Are our brawlers\r\ngetting angry at last?"\r\n\r\n"It is perhaps the colliers again," said the peasant-woman. "This is\r\ntwice they\'ve passed. Seems things are not going well; they\'re masters\r\nof the country."\r\n\r\nShe uttered every word prudently, watching the effect on their faces;\r\nand when she noticed the fright of all of them, and their deep anxiety\r\nat this encounter, she hastened to conclude:\r\n\r\n"Oh, the rascals! the rascals!"\r\n\r\nN\xc3\xa9grel, seeing that it was too late to get into their carriage and\r\nreach Montsou, ordered the coachman to bring the vehicle into the\r\nfarmyard, where it would remain hidden behind a shed. He himself\r\nfastened his horse, which a lad had been holding, beneath the shed.\r\nWhen he came back he found his aunt and the young girls distracted, and\r\nready to follow the peasant-woman, who proposed that they should take\r\nrefuge in her house. But he was of opinion that they would be safer\r\nwhere they were, for certainly no one would come and look for them in\r\nthe hay. The door, however, shut very badly, and had such large chinks\r\nin it, that the road could be seen between the worm-eaten planks.\r\n\r\n"Come, courage!" he said. "We will sell our lives dearly."\r\n\r\nThis joke increased their fear. The noise grew louder, but nothing\r\ncould yet be seen; along the vacant road the wind of a tempest seemed\r\nto be blowing, like those sudden gusts which precede great storms.\r\n\r\n"No, no! I don\'t want to look," said C\xc3\xa9cile, going to hide herself in\r\nthe hay.\r\n\r\nMadame Hennebeau, who was very pale and felt angry with these people\r\nwho had spoilt her pleasure, stood in the background with a sidelong\r\nlook of repugnance; while Lucie and Jeanne, though trembling, had\r\nplaced their eyes at a crack, anxious to lose nothing of the spectacle.\r\n\r\nA sound of thunder came near, the earth was shaken, and Jeanlin\r\ngalloped up first, blowing into his horn.\r\n\r\n"Take out your scent-bottles, the sweat of the people is passing by!"\r\nmurmured N\xc3\xa9grel, who, in spite of his republican convictions, liked to\r\nmake fun of the populace when he was with ladies.\r\n\r\nBut this witticism was carried away in the hurricane of gestures\r\nand cries. The women had appeared, nearly a thousand of them, with\r\noutspread hair dishevelled by running, the naked skin appearing through\r\ntheir rags, the nakedness of females weary with giving birth to\r\nstarvelings. A few held their little ones in their arms, raising them\r\nand shaking them like banners of mourning and vengeance. Others, who\r\nwere younger with the swollen breasts of amazons, brandished sticks;\r\nwhile frightful old women were yelling so loudly that the cords of\r\ntheir fleshless necks seemed to be breaking. And then the men came up,\r\ntwo thousand madmen--trammers, pikemen, menders--a compact mass which\r\nrolled along like a single block in confused serried rank so that it\r\nwas impossible to distinguish their faded trousers or ragged woollen\r\njackets, all effaced in the same earthy uniformity. Their eyes were\r\nburning, and one only distinguished the holes of black mouths singing\r\nthe _Marseillaise_; the stanzas were lost in a confused roar,\r\naccompanied by the clang of sabots over the hard earth. Above their\r\nheads, amid the bristling iron bars, an axe passed by, carried erect;\r\nand this single axe, which seemed to be the standard of the band,\r\nshowed in the clear air the sharp profile of a guillotine-blade.\r\n\r\n"What atrocious faces!" stammered Madame Hennebeau.\r\n\r\nN\xc3\xa9grel said between his teeth:\r\n\r\n"Devil take me if I can recognize one of them! Where do the bandits\r\nspring from?"\r\n\r\nAnd in fact anger, hunger, these two months of suffering and this\r\nenraged helter-skelter through the pits had lengthened the placid\r\nfaces of the Montsou colliers into the muzzles of wild beasts. At\r\nthis moment the sun was setting; its last rays of sombre purple cast\r\na gleam of blood over the plain. The road seemed to be full of blood;\r\nmen and women continued to rush by, bloody as butchers in the midst of\r\nslaughter.\r\n\r\n"Oh! superb!" whispered Lucie and Jeanne, stirred in their artistic\r\ntastes by the beautiful horror of it.\r\n\r\nThey were frightened, however, and drew back close to Madame Hennebeau,\r\nwho was leaning on a trough. She was frozen at the thought that a\r\nglance between the planks of that disjointed door might suffice to\r\nmurder them. N\xc3\xa9grel also, who was usually very brave, felt himself grow\r\npale, seized by a terror that was superior to his will, the terror\r\nwhich comes from the unknown. C\xc3\xa9cile, in the hay, no longer stirred;\r\nand the others, in spite of the wish to turn away their eyes, could not\r\ndo so: they were compelled to gaze.\r\n\r\nIt was the red vision of the revolution, which would one day inevitably\r\ncarry them all away, on some bloody evening at the end of the century.\r\nYes, some evening the people, unbridled at last, would thus gallop\r\nalong the roads, making the blood of the middle class flow, parading\r\nsevered heads and sprinkling gold from disembowelled coffers. The women\r\nwould yell, the men would have those wolf-like jaws open to bite. Yes,\r\nthe same rags, the same thunder of great sabots, the same terrible\r\ntroop, with dirty skins and tainted breath, sweeping away the old world\r\nbeneath an overflowing flood of barbarians. Fires would flame; they\r\nwould not leave standing one stone of the towns; they would return to\r\nthe savage life of the woods, after the great rut, the great feast-day,\r\nwhen the poor in one night would emaciate the wives and empty the\r\ncellars of the rich. There would be nothing left, not a sou of the\r\ngreat fortunes, not a title-deed of properties acquired; until the day\r\ndawned when a new earth would perhaps spring up once more. Yes, it\r\nwas these things which were passing along the road; it was the force\r\nof nature herself, and they were receiving the terrible wind of it in\r\ntheir faces.\r\n\r\nA great cry arose, dominating the _Marseillaise_:\r\n\r\n"Bread! bread! bread!"\r\n\r\nLucie and Jeanne pressed themselves against Madame Hennebeau, who was\r\nalmost fainting; while N\xc3\xa9grel placed himself before them as though\r\nto protect them by his body. Was the old social order cracking this\r\nvery evening? And what they saw immediately after completed their\r\nstupefaction. The band had nearly passed by, there were only a few\r\nstragglers left, when Mouquette came up. She was delaying, watching\r\nthe bourgeois at their garden gates or the windows of their houses;\r\nand whenever she saw them, as she was not able to spit in their faces,\r\nshe showed them what for her was the climax of contempt. Doubtless she\r\nperceived someone now, for suddenly she raised her skirts, bent her\r\nback, and showed her enormous buttocks, naked beneath the last rays of\r\nthe sun. There was nothing obscene in those fierce buttocks, and nobody\r\nlaughed.\r\n\r\nEverything disappeared: the flood rolled on to Montsou along the turns\r\nof the road, between the low houses streaked with bright colours. The\r\ncarriage was drawn out of the yard, but the coachman would not take it\r\nupon him to convey back madame and the young ladies without delay; the\r\nstrikers occupied the street. And the worst was, there was no other\r\nroad.\r\n\r\n"We must go back, however, for dinner will be ready," said Madame\r\nHennebeau, exasperated by annoyance and fear. "These dirty workpeople\r\nhave again chosen a day when I have visitors. How can you do good to\r\nsuch creatures?"\r\n\r\nLucie and Jeanne were occupied in pulling C\xc3\xa9cile out of the hay. She\r\nwas struggling, believing that those savages were still passing by,\r\nand repeating that she did not want to see them. At last they all took\r\ntheir places in the carriage again. It then occurred to N\xc3\xa9grel, who had\r\nremounted, that they might go through the R\xc3\xa9quillart lanes.\r\n\r\n"Go gently," he said to the coachman, "for the road is atrocious. If\r\nany groups prevent you from returning to the road over there, you can\r\nstop behind the old pit, and we will return on foot through the little\r\ngarden door, while you can put up the carriage and horses anywhere, in\r\nsome inn outhouse."\r\n\r\nThey set out. The band, far away, was streaming into Montsou. As they\r\nhad twice seen police and military, the inhabitants were agitated and\r\nseized by panic. Abominable stories were circulating; it was said that\r\nwritten placards had been set up threatening to rip open the bellies of\r\nthe bourgeois. Nobody had read them, but all the same they were able\r\nto quote the exact words. At the lawyer\'s especially the terror was\r\nat its height, for he had just received by post an anonymous letter\r\nwarning him that a barrel of powder was buried in his cellar, and that\r\nit would be blown up if he did not declare himself on the side of the\r\npeople. Just then the Gr\xc3\xa9goires, prolonging their visit on the arrival\r\nof this letter, were discussing it, and decided that it must be the\r\nwork of a joker, when the invasion of the mob completed the terror of\r\nthe house. They, however, smiled, drawing back a corner of the curtain\r\nto look out, and refused to admit that there was any danger, certain,\r\nthey said, that all would finish up well. Five o\'clock struck, and they\r\nhad time to wait until the street was free for them to cross the road\r\nto dine with the Hennebeaus, where C\xc3\xa9cile, who had surely returned,\r\nmust be waiting for them. But no one in Montsou seemed to share their\r\nconfidence. People were wildly running about; doors and windows were\r\nbanged to. They saw Maigrat, on the other side of the road, barricading\r\nhis shop with a large supply of iron bars, and looking so pale and\r\ntrembling that his feeble little wife was obliged to fasten the screws.\r\nThe band had come to a halt before the manager\'s villa, and the cry\r\nechoed:\r\n\r\n"Bread! bread! bread!"\r\n\r\nM. Hennebeau was standing at the window when Hippolyte came in to close\r\nthe shutters, for fear the windows should be broken by stones. He\r\nclosed all on the ground floor, and then went up to the first floor;\r\nthe creak of the window-fasteners was heard and the clack of the\r\nshutters one by one. Unfortunately, it was not possible to shut the\r\nkitchen window in the area in the same way, a window made disquietingly\r\nruddy by the gleams from the saucepans and the spit.\r\n\r\nMechanically, M. Hennebeau, who wished to look out, went up to Paul\'s\r\nroom on the second floor: it was on the left, the best situated, for it\r\ncommanded the road as far as the Company\'s Yards. And he stood behind\r\nthe blinds overlooking the crowd. But this room had again overcome\r\nhim, the toilet table sponged and in order, the cold bed with neat and\r\nwell-drawn sheets. All his rage of the afternoon, that furious battle\r\nin the depths of his silent solitude, had now turned to an immense\r\nfatigue. His whole being was now like this room, grown cold, swept of\r\nthe filth of the morning, returned to its habitual correctness. What\r\nwas the good of a scandal? had anything really changed in his house?\r\nHis wife had simply taken another lover; that she had chosen him in the\r\nfamily scarcely aggravated the fact; perhaps even it was an advantage,\r\nfor she thus preserved appearances. He pitied himself when he thought\r\nof his mad jealousy. How ridiculous to have struck that bed with his\r\nfists! Since he had tolerated another man, he could certainly tolerate\r\nthis one. It was only a matter of a little more contempt. A terrible\r\nbitterness was poisoning his mouth, the uselessness of everything, the\r\neternal pain of existence, shame for himself who always adored and\r\ndesired this woman in the dirt in which he had abandoned her.\r\n\r\nBeneath the window the yells broke out with increased violence:\r\n\r\n"Bread! bread! bread!"\r\n\r\n"Idiots!" said M. Hennebeau between his clenched teeth.\r\n\r\nHe heard them abusing him for his large salary, calling him a bloated\r\nidler, a bloody beast who stuffed himself to indigestion with good\r\nthings, while the worker was dying of hunger. The women had noticed the\r\nkitchen, and there was a tempest of imprecations against the pheasant\r\nroasting there, against the sauces that with fat odours irritated their\r\nempty stomachs. Ah! the stinking bourgeois, they should be stuffed with\r\nchampagne and truffles till their guts burst.\r\n\r\n"Bread! bread! bread!"\r\n\r\n"Idiots!" repeated M. Hennebeau; "am I happy?"\r\n\r\nAnger arose in him against these people who could not understand. He\r\nwould willingly have made them a present of his large salary to possess\r\ntheir hard skin and their facility of coupling without regret. Why\r\ncould he not seat them at his table and stuff them with his pheasant,\r\nwhile he went to fornicate behind the hedges, to tumble the girls over,\r\nmaking fun of those who had tumbled them over before him! He would have\r\ngiven everything, his education, his comfort, his luxury, his power\r\nas manager, if he could be for one day the vilest of the wretches who\r\nobeyed him, free of his flesh, enough of a blackguard to beat his wife\r\nand to take his pleasure with his neighbours\' wives. And he longed also\r\nto be dying of hunger, to have an empty belly, a stomach twisted by\r\ncramps that would make his head turn with giddiness: perhaps that would\r\nhave killed the eternal pain. Ah! to live like a brute, to possess\r\nnothing, to scour the fields with the ugliest and dirtiest putter, and\r\nto be able to be happy!\r\n\r\n"Bread! bread! bread!"\r\n\r\nThen he grew angry and shouted furiously in the tumult:\r\n\r\n"Bread! is that enough, idiots!"\r\n\r\nHe could eat, and all the same he was groaning with torment. His\r\ndesolate household, his whole wounded life, choked him at the throat\r\nlike a death agony. Things were not all for the best because one had\r\nbread. Who was the fool who placed earthly happiness in the partition\r\nof wealth? These revolutionary dreamers might demolish society and\r\nrebuilt another society; they would not add one joy to humanity,\r\nthey would not take away one pain, by cutting bread-and-butter for\r\neverybody. They would even enlarge the unhappiness of the earth; they\r\nwould one day make the very dogs howl with despair when they had taken\r\nthem out of the tranquil satisfaction of instinct, to raise them to the\r\nunappeasable suffering of passion. No, the one good thing was not to\r\nexist, and if one existed, to be a tree, a stone, less still, a grain\r\nof sand, which cannot bleed beneath the heels of the passer-by.\r\n\r\nAnd in this exasperation of his torment, tears swelled in M.\r\nHennebeau\'s eyes, and broke in burning drops on his cheeks. The\r\ntwilight was drowning the road when stones began to riddle the front\r\nof the villa. With no anger now against these starving people, only\r\nenraged by the burning wound at his heart he continued to stammer in\r\nthe midst of his tears:\r\n\r\n"Idiots! idiots!"\r\n\r\nBut the cry of the belly dominated, and a roar blew like a tempest,\r\nsweeping everything before it:\r\n\r\n"Bread! bread! bread!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\nSobered by Catherine\'s blows, \xc3\x89tienne had remained at the head of his\r\nmates. But while he was hoarsely urging them on to Montsou, he heard\r\nanother voice within him, the voice of reason, asking, in astonishment,\r\nthe meaning of all this. He had not intended any of these things; how\r\nhad it happened that, having set out for Jean-Bart with the object of\r\nacting calmly and preventing disaster, he had finished this day of\r\nincreasing violence by besieging the manager\'s villa?\r\n\r\nHe it certainly was, however, who had just cried, "Halt!" Only at first\r\nhis sole idea had been to protect the Company\'s Yards, which there had\r\nbeen talk of sacking. And now that stones were already grazing the\r\nfacade of the villa, he sought in vain for some lawful prey on which to\r\nthrow the band, so as to avoid greater misfortunes. As he thus stood\r\nalone, powerless, in the middle of the road, he was called by a man\r\nstanding on the threshold of the Estaminet Tison, where the landlady\r\nhad just put up the shutters in haste, leaving only the door free.\r\n\r\n"Yes, it\'s me. Will you listen?"\r\n\r\nIt was Rasseneur. Some thirty men and women, nearly all belonging to\r\nthe settlement of the Deux-Cent-Quarante, who had remained at home in\r\nthe morning and had come in the evening for news, had invaded this\r\nestaminet on the approach of the strikers. Zacharie occupied a table\r\nwith his wife, Philom\xc3\xa9ne. Farther on, Pierron and Pierronne, with their\r\nbacks turned, were hiding their faces. No one was drinking, they had\r\nsimply taken shelter.\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne recognized Rasseneur and was turning away, when the latter\r\nadded:\r\n\r\n"You don\'t want to see me, eh? I warned you, things are getting\r\nawkward. Now you may ask for bread, they\'ll give you lead."\r\n\r\nThen \xc3\x89tienne came back and replied:\r\n\r\n"What troubles me is, the cowards who fold their arms and watch us\r\nrisking our skins."\r\n\r\n"Your notion, then, is to pillage over there?" asked Rasseneur.\r\n\r\n"My notion is to remain to the last with our friends, quit by dying\r\ntogether."\r\n\r\nIn despair, \xc3\x89tienne went back into the crowd, ready to die. On the\r\nroad, three children were throwing stones, and he gave them a good\r\nkick, shouting out to his comrades that it was no good breaking windows.\r\n\r\nB\xc3\xa9bert and Lydie, who had rejoined Jeanlin, were learning from him how\r\nto work the sling. They each sent a flint, playing at who could do the\r\nmost damage. Lydie had awkwardly cracked the head of a woman in the\r\ncrowd, and the two boys were loudly laughing. Bonnemort and Mouque,\r\nseated on a bench, were gazing at them behind. Bonnemort\'s swollen legs\r\nbore him so badly, that he had great difficulty in dragging himself\r\nso far; no one knew what curiosity impelled him, for his face had the\r\nearthy look of those days when he never spoke a word.\r\n\r\nNobody, however, any longer obeyed \xc3\x89tienne. The stones, in spite of his\r\norders, went on hailing, and he was astonished and terrified by these\r\nbrutes he had unmuzzled, who were so slow to move and then so terrible,\r\nso ferociously tenacious in their rage. All the old Flemish blood was\r\nthere, heavy and placid, taking months to get heated, and then giving\r\nitself up to abominable savagery, listening to nothing until the beast\r\nwas glutted by atrocities. In his southern land crowds flamed up more\r\nquickly, but they did not effect so much. He had to struggle with\r\nLevaque to obtain possession of his axe, and he knew not how to keep\r\nback the Maheus, who were throwing flints with both hands. The women,\r\nespecially, terrified him--the Levaque, Mouquette, and the others--who\r\nwere agitated by murderous fury, with teeth and nails out, barking like\r\nbitches, and driven on by Mother Brul\xc3\xa9, whose lean figure dominated\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nBut there was a sudden stop; a moment\'s surprise brought a little of\r\nthat calmness which \xc3\x89tienne\'s supplications could not obtain. It was\r\nsimply the Gr\xc3\xa9goires, who had decided to bid farewell to the lawyer,\r\nand to cross the road to the manager\'s house; and they seemed so\r\npeaceful, they so clearly had the air of believing that the whole\r\nthing was a joke on the part of their worthy miners, whose resignation\r\nhad nourished them for a century, that the latter, in fact, left off\r\nthrowing stones, for fear of hitting this old gentleman and old lady\r\nwho had fallen from the sky. They allowed them to enter the garden,\r\nmount the steps, and ring at the barricaded door, which was by no means\r\nopened in a hurry. Just then, Rose, the housemaid, was returning,\r\nlaughing at the furious workmen, all of whom she knew, for she belonged\r\nto Montsou. And it was she who, by striking her fists against the\r\ndoor, at last forced Hippolyte to set it ajar. It was time, for as the\r\nGr\xc3\xa9goires disappeared, the hail of stones began again. Recovering from\r\nits astonishment, the crowd was shouting louder than ever:\r\n\r\n"Death to the bourgeois! Hurrah for the people!"\r\n\r\nRose went on laughing, in the hall of the villa, as though amused by\r\nthe adventure, and repeated to the terrified man-servant:\r\n\r\n"They\'re not bad-hearted; I know them."\r\n\r\nM. Gr\xc3\xa9goire methodically hung up his hat. Then, when he had assisted\r\nMadame Gr\xc3\xa9goire to draw off her thick cloth mantle, he said, in his\r\nturn:\r\n\r\n"Certainly, they have no malice at bottom. When they have shouted well\r\nthey will go home to supper with more appetite."\r\n\r\nAt this moment M. Hennebeau came down from the second floor. He had\r\nseen the scene, and came to receive his guests in his usual cold and\r\npolite manner. The pallor of his face alone revealed the grief which\r\nhad shaken him. The man was tamed; there only remained in him the\r\ncorrect administrator resolved to do his duty.\r\n\r\n"You know," he said, "the ladies have not yet come back."\r\n\r\nFor the first time some anxiety disturbed the Gr\xc3\xa9goires. C\xc3\xa9cile not\r\ncome back! How could she come back now if the miners were to prolong\r\ntheir joking?\r\n\r\n"I thought of having the place cleared," added M. Hennebeau. "But the\r\nmisfortune is that I\'m alone here, and, besides, I do not know where to\r\nsend my servant to bring me four men and a corporal to clear away this\r\nmob."\r\n\r\nRose, who had remained there, ventured to murmur anew:\r\n\r\n"Oh, sir! they are not bad-hearted!"\r\n\r\nThe manager shook his head, while the tumult increased outside, and\r\nthey could hear the dull crash of the stones against the house.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t wish to be hard on them, I can even excuse them; one must be\r\nas foolish as they are to believe that we are anxious to injure them.\r\nBut it is my duty to prevent disturbance. To think that there are\r\npolice all along the roads, as I am told, and that I have not been able\r\nto see a single man since the morning!"\r\n\r\nHe interrupted himself, and drew back before Madame Gr\xc3\xa9goire, saying:\r\n\r\n"Let me beg you, madame, do not stay here, come into the drawing-room."\r\n\r\nBut the cook, coming up from below in exasperation, kept them in the\r\nhall a few minutes longer. She declared that she could no longer accept\r\nany responsibility for the dinner, for she was expecting from the\r\nMarchiennes pastrycook some _vol-au-vent_ crusts which she had\r\nordered for four o\'clock. The pastrycook had evidently turned aside\r\non the road for fear of these bandits. Perhaps they had even pillaged\r\nhis hampers. She saw the _vol-au-vent_ blockaded behind a bush,\r\nbesieged, going to swell the bellies of the three thousand wretches\r\nwho were asking for bread. In any case, monsieur was warned; she would\r\nrather pitch her dinner into the fire if it was to be spoilt because of\r\nthe revolt.\r\n\r\n"Patience, patience," said M. Hennebeau. "All is not lost, the\r\npastrycook may come."\r\n\r\nAnd as he turned toward Madame Gr\xc3\xa9goire, opening the drawing-room door\r\nhimself, he was much surprised to observe, seated on the hall bench, a\r\nman whom he had not distinguished before in the deepening shade.\r\n\r\n"What! you, Maigrat! what is it, then?"\r\n\r\nMaigrat arose; his fat, pale face was changed by terror. He no longer\r\npossessed his usual calm stolidity; he humbly explained that he had\r\nslipped into the manager\'s house to ask for aid and protection should\r\nthe brigands attack his shop.\r\n\r\n"You see that I am threatened myself, and that I have no one," replied\r\nM. Hennebeau. "You would have done better to stay at home and guard\r\nyour property."\r\n\r\n"Oh! I have put up iron bars and left my wife there."\r\n\r\nThe manager showed impatience, and did not conceal his contempt. A fine\r\nguard, that poor creature worn out by blows!\r\n\r\n"Well, I can do nothing; you must try to defend yourself. I advise you\r\nto go back at once, for there they are again demanding bread. Listen!"\r\n\r\nIn fact, the tumult began again, and Maigrat thought he heard his own\r\nname in the midst of the cries. To go back was no longer possible, they\r\nwould have torn him to pieces. Besides, the idea of his ruin overcame\r\nhim. He pressed his face to the glass panel of the door, perspiring and\r\ntrembling in anticipation of disaster, while the Gr\xc3\xa9goires decided to\r\ngo into the drawing-room.\r\n\r\nM. Hennebeau quietly endeavoured to do the honours of his house. But\r\nin vain he begged his guests to sit down; the close, barricaded room,\r\nlighted by two lamps in the daytime, was filled with terror at each\r\nnew clamour from without. Amid the stuffy hangings the fury of the mob\r\nrolled more disturbingly, with vague and terrible menace. They talked,\r\nhowever, constantly brought back to this inconceivable revolt. He was\r\nastonished at having foreseen nothing; and his information was so\r\ndefective that he specially talked against Rasseneur, whose detestable\r\ninfluence, he said, he was able to recognize. Besides, the gendarmes\r\nwould come; it was impossible that he should be thus abandoned. As\r\nto the Gr\xc3\xa9goires, they only thought about their daughter, the poor\r\ndarling who was so quickly frightened! Perhaps, in face of the peril,\r\nthe carriage had returned to Marchiennes. They waited on for another\r\nquarter of an hour, worn out by the noise in the street, and by the\r\nsound of the stones from time to time striking the closed shutters\r\nwhich rang out like gongs. The situation was no longer bearable. M.\r\nHennebeau spoke of going out to chase away the brawlers by himself, and\r\nto meet the carriage, when Hippolyte appeared, exclaiming:\r\n\r\n"Sir! sir, here is madame! They are killing madame!"\r\n\r\nThe carriage had not been able to pass through the threatening groups\r\nin the R\xc3\xa9quillart lane. N\xc3\xa9grel had carried out his idea, walking the\r\nhundred metres which separated them from the house, and knocking at\r\nthe little door which led to the garden, near the common. The gardener\r\nwould hear them, for there was always someone there to open. And, at\r\nfirst, things had gone perfectly; Madame Hennebeau and the young ladies\r\nwere already knocking when some women, who had been warned, rushed into\r\nthe lane. Then everything was spoilt. The door was not opened, and\r\nN\xc3\xa9grel in vain sought to burst it open with his shoulder. The rush of\r\nwomen increased, and fearing they would be carried away, he adopted the\r\ndesperate method of pushing his aunt and the girls before him, in order\r\nto reach the front steps, by passing through the besiegers. But this\r\nmanoeuvre led to a hustling. They were not left free, a shouting band\r\nfollowed them, while the crowd floated up to right and to left, without\r\nunderstanding, simply astonished at these dressed-up ladies lost in the\r\nmidst of the battle. At this moment the confusion was so great that\r\nit led to one of those curious mistakes which can never be explained.\r\nLucie and Jeanne reached the steps, and slipped in through the door,\r\nwhich the housemaid opened; Madame Hennebeau had succeeded in following\r\nthem, and behind them N\xc3\xa9grel at last came in, and then bolted the door,\r\nfeeling sure that he had seen C\xc3\xa9cile go in first. She was no longer\r\nthere, having disappeared on the way, so carried away by fear, that she\r\nhad turned her back to the house, and had moved of her own accord into\r\nthe thick of danger.\r\n\r\nAt once the cry arose:\r\n\r\n"Hurrah for the people! Death to the bourgeois! To death with them!"\r\n\r\nA few of those in the distance, beneath the veil which hid her face,\r\nmistook her for Madame Hennebeau; others said she was a friend of the\r\nmanager\'s wife, the young wife of a neighbouring manufacturer who\r\nwas execrated by his men. And besides it mattered little, it was her\r\nsilk dress, her fur mantle, even the white feather in her hat, which\r\nexasperated them. She smelled of perfume, she wore a watch, she had the\r\ndelicate skin of a lazy woman who had never touched coal.\r\n\r\n"Stop!" shouted Mother Brul\xc3\xa9, "we\'ll put it on your arse, that lace!"\r\n\r\n"The lazy sluts steal it from us," said the Levaque. "They stick fur\r\non to their skins while we are dying of cold. Just strip her naked, to\r\nshow her how to live!"\r\n\r\nAt once Mouquette rushed forward.\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes! whip her!"\r\n\r\nAnd the women, in this savage rivalry, struggled and stretched out\r\ntheir rags, as though each were trying to get a morsel of this rich\r\ngirl. No doubt her backside was not better made than any one else\'s.\r\nMore than one of them were rotten beneath their gewgaws. This injustice\r\nhad lasted quite long enough; they should be forced to dress themselves\r\nlike workwomen, these harlots who dared to spend fifty sous on the\r\nwashing of a single petticoat.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these furies C\xc3\xa9cile was shaking with paralysed legs,\r\nstammering over and over again the same phrase:\r\n\r\n"Ladies! please! please! Ladies, please don\'t hurt me!"\r\n\r\nBut she suddenly uttered a shrill cry; cold hands had seized her by\r\nthe neck. The rush had brought her near old Bonnemort, who had taken\r\nhold of her. He seemed drunk from hunger, stupefied by his long misery,\r\nsuddenly arousing himself from the resignation of half a century, under\r\nthe influence of no one knew what malicious impulse. After having in\r\nthe course of his life saved a dozen mates from death, risking his\r\nbones in fire-damps and landslips, he was yielding to things which he\r\nwould not have been able to express, compelled to do thus, fascinated\r\nby this young girl\'s white neck. And as on this day he had lost his\r\ntongue, he clenched his fingers, with his air of an old infirm animal\r\nruminating over his recollections.\r\n\r\n"No! no!" yelled the women. "Uncover her arse! out with her arse!"\r\n\r\nIn the villa, as soon as they had realized the mishap, N\xc3\xa9grel and M.\r\nHennebeau bravely reopened the door to run to C\xc3\xa9cile\'s help. But the\r\ncrowd was now pressing against the garden railings, and it was not easy\r\nto go out. A struggle took place here, while the Gr\xc3\xa9goires in terror\r\nstood on the steps.\r\n\r\n"Let her be then, old man! It\'s the Piolaine young lady," cried Maheude\r\nto the grandfather, recognizing C\xc3\xa9cile, whose veil had been torn off by\r\none of the women.\r\n\r\nOn his side, \xc3\x89tienne, overwhelmed at this retaliation on a child, was\r\ntrying to force the band to let go their prey. An inspiration came to\r\nhim; he brandished the axe, which he had snatched from Levaque\'s hands.\r\n\r\n"To Maigrat\'s house, by God! there\'s bread in there! Down to the earth\r\nwith Maigrat\'s damned shed!"\r\n\r\nAnd at random he gave the first blow of the axe against the shop door.\r\nSome comrades had followed him--Levaque, Maheu, and a few others. But\r\nthe women were furious, and C\xc3\xa9cile had fallen from Bonnemort\'s fingers\r\ninto Mother Brul\xc3\xa9\'s hands. Lydie and B\xc3\xa9bert, led by Jeanlin, had\r\nslipped on all fours between her petticoats to see the lady\'s bottom.\r\nAlready the women were pulling her about; her clothes were beginning\r\nto split, when a man on horseback appeared, pushing on his animal, and\r\nusing his riding-whip on those who would not stand back quick enough.\r\n\r\n"Ah! rascals! You are going to flog our daughters, are you?"\r\n\r\nIt was Deneulin who had come to the rendezvous for dinner. He quickly\r\njumped on to the road, took C\xc3\xa9cile by the waist, and, with the other\r\nhand manipulating his horse with remarkable skill and strength, he used\r\nit as a living wedge to split the crowd, which drew back before the\r\nonset. At the railing the battle continued. He passed through, however,\r\nwith some bruises. This unforeseen assistance delivered N\xc3\xa9grel and M.\r\nHennebeau, who were in great danger amid the oaths and blows. And while\r\nthe young man at last led in the fainting C\xc3\xa9cile, Deneulin protected\r\nthe manager with his tall body, and at the top of the steps received a\r\nstone which nearly put his shoulder out.\r\n\r\n"That\'s it," he cried; "break my bones now you\'ve broken my engines!"\r\n\r\nHe promptly pushed the door to, and a volley of flints fell against it.\r\n\r\n"What madmen!" he exclaimed. "Two seconds more, and they would have\r\nbroken my skull like an empty gourd. There is nothing to say to them;\r\nwhat could you do? They know nothing, you can only knock them down."\r\n\r\nIn the drawing-room, the Gr\xc3\xa9goires were weeping as they watched C\xc3\xa9cile\r\nrecover. She was not hurt, there was not even a scratch to be seen,\r\nonly her veil was lost. But their fright increased when they saw before\r\nthem their cook, M\xc3\xa9lanie, who described how the mob had demolished\r\nPiolaine. Mad with fear she had run to warn her masters. She had come\r\nin when the door was ajar at the moment of the fray, without any one\r\nnoticing her; and in her endless narrative the single stone with which\r\nJeanlin had broken one window-pane became a regular cannonade which had\r\ncrushed through the walls. Then M. Gr\xc3\xa9goire\'s ideas were altogether\r\nupset: they were murdering his daughter, they were razing his house to\r\nthe ground; it was, then, true that these miners could bear him ill\r\nwill, because he lived like a worthy man on their labour?\r\n\r\nThe housemaid, who had brought in a towel and some eau-de-Cologne,\r\nrepeated:\r\n\r\n"All the same it\'s queer, they\'re not bad-hearted."\r\n\r\nMadame Hennebeau, seated and very pale, had not recovered from the\r\nshock to her feelings; and she was only able to find a smile when\r\nN\xc3\xa9grel was complimented. C\xc3\xa9cile\'s parents especially thanked the young\r\nman, and the marriage might now be regarded as settled. M. Hennebeau\r\nlooked on in silence, turning from his wife to this lover whom in the\r\nmorning he had been swearing to kill, then to this young girl by whom\r\nhe would, no doubt, soon be freed from him. There was no haste, only\r\nthe fear remained with him of seeing his wife fall lower, perhaps to\r\nsome lackey.\r\n\r\n"And you, my little darlings," asked Deneulin of his daughters; "have\r\nthey broken any of your bones?"\r\n\r\nLucie and Jeanne had been much afraid, but they were pleased to have\r\nseen it all. They were now laughing.\r\n\r\n"By George!" the father went on, "we\'ve had a fine day! If you want a\r\ndowry, you would do well to earn it yourselves, and you may also expect\r\nto have to support me."\r\n\r\nHe was joking, but his voice trembled. His eyes swelled with tears as\r\nhis two daughters threw themselves into his arms.\r\n\r\nM. Hennebeau had heard this confession of ruin. A quick thought lit up\r\nhis face. Vandame would now belong to Montsou; this was the hoped-for\r\ncompensation, the stroke of fortune which would bring him back to\r\nfavour with the gentlemen on the directorate. At every crisis of his\r\nexistence, he took refuge in the strict execution of the orders he had\r\nreceived; in the military discipline in which he lived he found his\r\nsmall share of happiness.\r\n\r\nBut they grew calm; the drawing-room fell back into a weary\r\npeacefulness, with the quiet light of its two lamps, and the warm\r\nstuffiness of the hangings. What, then, was going on outside? The\r\nbrawlers were silent, and stones no longer struck the house; one only\r\nheard deep, full blows, those blows of the hatchet which one hears in\r\ndistant woods. They wished to find out, and went back into the hall to\r\nventure a glance through the glass panel of the door. Even the ladies\r\nwent upstairs to post themselves behind the blinds on the first floor.\r\n\r\n"Do you see that scoundrel, Rasseneur, over there on the threshold of\r\nthe public-house?" said M. Hennebeau to Deneulin. "I had guessed as\r\nmuch; he must be in it."\r\n\r\nIt was not Rasseneur, however, it was \xc3\x89tienne, who was dealing blows\r\nfrom his axe at Maigrat\'s shop. And he went on calling to the men; did\r\nnot the goods in there belong to the colliers? Had they not the right\r\nto take back their property from this thief who had exploited them so\r\nlong, who was starving them at a hint from the Company? Gradually they\r\nall left the manager\'s house, and ran up to pillage the neighbouring\r\nshop. The cry, "Bread! bread! bread!" broke out anew. They would find\r\nbread behind that door. The rage of hunger carried them away, as if\r\nthey suddenly felt that they could wait no longer without expiring on\r\nthe road. Such furious thrusts were made at the door that at every\r\nstroke of the axe \xc3\x89tienne feared to wound someone.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Maigrat, who had left the hall of the manager\'s house, had\r\nat first taken refuge in the kitchen; but, hearing nothing there, he\r\nimagined some abominable attempt against his shop, and came up again\r\nto hide behind the pump outside, when he distinctly heard the cracking\r\nof the door and shouts of pillage in which his own name was mixed. It\r\nwas not a nightmare, then. If he could not see, he could now hear, and\r\nhe followed the attack with ringing ears; every blow struck him in the\r\nheart. A hinge must have given way; five minutes more and the shop\r\nwould be taken. The thing was stamped on his brain in real and terrible\r\nimages--the brigands rushing forward, then the drawers broken open, the\r\nsacks emptied, everything eaten, everything drunk, the house itself\r\ncarried away, nothing left, not even a stick with which he might go and\r\nbeg through the villages. No, he would never allow them to complete\r\nhis ruin; he would rather leave his life there. Since he had been here\r\nhe noticed at a window of his house his wife\'s thin silhouette, pale\r\nand confused, behind the panes; no doubt she was watching the blows\r\nwith her usual silent air of a poor beaten creature. Beneath there was\r\na shed, so placed that from the villa garden one could climb it from\r\nthe palings; then it was easy to get on to the tiles up to the window.\r\nAnd the idea of thus returning home now pursued him in his remorse at\r\nhaving left. Perhaps he would have time to barricade the shop with\r\nfurniture; he even invented other and more heroic defences--boiling\r\noil, lighted petroleum, poured out from above. But this love of his\r\nproperty struggled against his fear, and he groaned in the battle with\r\ncowardice. Suddenly, on hearing a deeper blow of the axe, he made up\r\nhis mind. Avarice conquered; he and his wife would cover the sacks with\r\ntheir bodies rather than abandon a single loaf.\r\n\r\nAlmost immediately hooting broke out:\r\n\r\n"Look! look!--The tom-cat\'s up there! After the cat! after the cat!"\r\n\r\nThe mob had just seen Maigrat on the roof of the shed. In his fever of\r\nanxiety he had climbed the palings with agility in spite of his weight,\r\nand without troubling over the breaking wood; and now he was flattening\r\nhimself along the tiles, and endeavouring to reach the window. But the\r\nslope was very steep; he was incommoded by his stoutness, and his nails\r\nwere torn. He would have dragged himself up, however, if he had not\r\nbegun to tremble with the fear of stones; for the crowd, which he could\r\nnot see, continued to cry beneath him:\r\n\r\n"After the cat! after the cat!--Do for him!"\r\n\r\nAnd suddenly both his hands let go at once, and he rolled down like a\r\nball, leapt at the gutter, and fell across the middle wall in such a\r\nway that, by ill-chance, he rebounded on the side of the road, where\r\nhis skull was broken open on the corner of a stone pillar. His brain\r\nhad spurted out. He was dead. His wife up above, pale and confused\r\nbehind the window-panes, still looked out.\r\n\r\nThey were stupefied at first. \xc3\x89tienne stopped short, and the axe\r\nslipped from his hands. Maheu, Levaque, and the others forgot the shop,\r\nwith their eyes fixed on the wall along which a thin red streak was\r\nslowly flowing down. And the cries ceased, and silence spread over the\r\ngrowing darkness.\r\n\r\nAll at once the hooting began again. It was the women, who rushed\r\nforward overcome by the drunkenness of blood.\r\n\r\n"Then there is a good God, after all! Ah! the bloody beast, he\'s done\r\nfor!"\r\n\r\nThey surrounded the still warm body. They insulted it with laughter,\r\nabusing his fractured head, the dirty chops, hurling in the dead man\'s\r\nface the long venom of their starved lives.\r\n\r\n"I owed you sixty francs, now you\'re paid, thief!" said Maheude,\r\nenraged like the others. "You won\'t refuse me credit any more. Wait!\r\nwait! I must fatten you once more!"\r\n\r\nWith her fingers she scratched up some earth, took two handfuls and\r\nstuffed it violently into his mouth.\r\n\r\n"There! eat that! There! eat! eat! you used to eat us!"\r\n\r\nThe abuse increased, while the dead man, stretched on his back, gazed\r\nmotionless with his large fixed eyes at the immense sky from which the\r\nnight was falling. This earth heaped in his mouth was the bread he had\r\nrefused to give. And henceforth he would eat of no other bread. It had\r\nnot brought him luck to starve poor people.\r\n\r\nBut the women had another revenge to wreak on him. They moved round,\r\nsmelling him like she-wolves. They were all seeking for some outrage,\r\nsome savagery that would relieve them.\r\n\r\nMother Brul\xc3\xa9\'s shrill voice was heard: "Cut him like a tom-cat!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, after the cat! after the cat! He\'s done too much, the dirty\r\nbeast!"\r\n\r\nMouquette was already unfastening and drawing off the trousers, while\r\nthe Levaque woman raised the legs. And Mother Brul\xc3\xa9 with her dry old\r\nhands separated the naked thighs and seized this dead virility. She\r\ntook hold of everything, tearing with an effort which bent her lean\r\nspine and made her long arms crack. The soft skin resisted; she had to\r\ntry again, and at last carried away the fragment, a lump of hairy and\r\nbleeding flesh, which she brandished with a laugh of triumph.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got it! I\'ve got it!"\r\n\r\nShrill voices saluted with curses the abominable trophy.\r\n\r\n"Ah! swine! you won\'t fill our daughters any more!"\r\n\r\n"Yes! we\'ve done with paying on your beastly body; we shan\'t any more\r\nhave to offer a backside in return for a loaf."\r\n\r\n"Here, I owe you six francs; would you like to settle it? I\'m quite\r\nwilling, if you can do it still!"\r\n\r\nThis joke shook them all with terrible gaiety. They showed each other\r\nthe bleeding fragment as an evil beast from which each of them had\r\nsuffered, and which they had at last crushed, and saw before them\r\nthere, inert, in their power. They spat on it, they thrust out their\r\njaws, saying over and over again, with furious bursts of contempt:\r\n\r\n"He can do no more! he can do no more!--It\'s no longer a man that\r\nthey\'ll put away in the earth. Go and rot then, good-for-nothing!"\r\n\r\nMother Brul\xc3\xa9 then planted the whole lump on the end of her stick, and\r\nholding it in the air, bore it about like a banner, rushing along the\r\nroad, followed, helter-skelter, by the yelling troop of women. Drops\r\nof blood rained down, and that pitiful flesh hung like a waste piece\r\nof meat on a butcher\'s stall. Up above, at the window, Madame Maigrat\r\nstill stood motionless; but beneath the last gleams of the setting\r\nsun, the confused flaws of the window-panes distorted her white face\r\nwhich looked as though it were laughing. Beaten and deceived at every\r\nhour, with shoulders bent from morning to night over a ledger, perhaps\r\nshe was laughing, while the band of women rushed along with that evil\r\nbeast, that crushed beast, at the end of the stick.\r\n\r\nThis frightful mutilation was accomplished in frozen horror. Neither\r\n\xc3\x89tienne nor Maheu nor the others had had time to interfere; they stood\r\nmotionless before this gallop of furies. At the door of the Estaminet\r\nTison a few heads were grouped--Rasseneur pale with disgust, Zacharie\r\nand Philom\xc3\xa9ne stupefied at what they had seen. The two old men,\r\nBonnemort and Mouque, were gravely shaking their heads. Only Jeanlin\r\nwas making fun, pushing B\xc3\xa9bert with his elbow, and forcing Lydie to\r\nlook up. But the women were already coming back, turning round and\r\npassing beneath the manager\'s windows. Behind the blinds the ladies\r\nwere stretching out their necks. They had not been able to observe\r\nthe scene, which was hidden from them by the wall, and they could not\r\ndistinguish well in the growing darkness.\r\n\r\n"What is it they have at the end of that stick?" asked C\xc3\xa9cile, who had\r\ngrown bold enough to look out.\r\n\r\nLucie and Jeanne declared that it must be a rabbit-skin.\r\n\r\n"No, no," murmured Madame Hennebeau, "they must have been pillaging a\r\npork butcher\'s, it seems to be a remnant of a pig."\r\n\r\nAt this moment she shuddered and was silent. Madame Gr\xc3\xa9goire had nudged\r\nher with her knee. They both remained stupefied. The young ladies, who\r\nwere very pale, asked no more questions, but with large eyes followed\r\nthis red vision through the darkness.\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne once more brandished the axe. But the feeling of anxiety did\r\nnot disappear; this corpse now barred the road and protected the shop.\r\nMany had drawn back. Satiety seemed to have appeased them all. Maheu\r\nwas standing by gloomily, when he heard a voice whisper in his ear to\r\nescape. He turned round and recognized Catherine, still in her old\r\novercoat, black and panting. With a movement he repelled her. He would\r\nnot listen to her, he threatened to strike her. With a gesture of\r\ndespair she hesitated, and then ran towards \xc3\x89tienne.\r\n\r\n"Save yourself! save yourself! the gendarmes are coming!"\r\n\r\nHe also pushed her away and abused her, feeling the blood of the\r\nblows she had given him mounting to his cheeks. But she would not be\r\nrepelled; she forced him to throw down the axe, and drew him away by\r\nboth arms, with irresistible strength.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t I tell you the gendarmes are coming! Listen to me. It\'s Chaval\r\nwho has gone for them and is bringing them, if you want to know. It\'s\r\ntoo much for me, and I\'ve come. Save yourself, I don\'t want them to\r\ntake you."\r\n\r\nAnd Catherine drew him away, while, at the same instant, a heavy gallop\r\nshook the street from afar. Immediately a voice arose: "The gendarmes!\r\nthe gendarmes!" There was a general breaking up, so mad a rush for life\r\nthat in two minutes the road was free, absolutely clear, as though\r\nswept by a hurricane. Maigrat\'s corpse alone made a patch of shadow on\r\nthe white earth. Before the Estaminet Tison, Rasseneur only remained,\r\nfeeling relieved, and with open face applauding the easy victory of the\r\nsabres; while in dim and deserted Montsou, in the silence of the closed\r\nhouses, the bourgeois remained with perspiring skins and chattering\r\nteeth, not daring to look out. The plain was drowned beneath the thick\r\nnight, only the blast furnaces and the coke furnaces were burning\r\nagainst the tragic sky. The gallop of the gendarmes heavily approached;\r\nthey came up in an indistinguishable sombre mass. And behind them the\r\nMarchiennes pastrycook\'s vehicle, a little covered cart which had been\r\nconfided to their care, at last arrived, and a small drudge of a boy\r\njumped down and quietly unpacked the crusts for the _vol-au-vent_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART SIX\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first fortnight of February passed and a black cold prolonged\r\nthe hard winter without pity for the poor. Once more the authorities\r\nhad scoured the roads; the prefect of Lille, an attorney, a general,\r\nand the police were not sufficient, the military had come to occupy\r\nMontsou; a whole regiment of men were camped between Beaugnies and\r\nMarchiennes. Armed pickets guarded the pits, and there were soldiers\r\nbefore every engine. The manager\'s villa, the Company\'s Yards, even\r\nthe houses of certain residents, were bristling with bayonets. Nothing\r\nwas heard along the streets but the slow movement of patrols. On the\r\npit-bank of the Voreux a sentinel was always placed in the frozen wind\r\nthat blew up there, like a look-out man above the flat plain; and every\r\ntwo hours, as though in an enemy\'s country, were heard the sentry\'s\r\ncries:\r\n\r\n"_Qui vive?_--Advance and give the password!"\r\n\r\nNowhere had work been resumed. On the contrary, the strike had spread;\r\nCr\xc3\xa9vecoeur, Mirou, Madeleine, like the Voreux, were producing nothing;\r\nat Feutry-Cantel and the Victoire there were fewer men every morning;\r\neven at Saint-Thomas, which had been hitherto exempt, men were wanting.\r\nThere was now a silent persistence in the face of this exhibition of\r\nforce which exasperated the miners\' pride. The settlements looked\r\ndeserted in the midst of the beetroot fields. Not a workman stirred,\r\nonly at rare intervals was one to be met by chance, isolated, with\r\nsidelong look, lowering his head before the red trousers. And in this\r\ndeep melancholy calm, in this passive opposition to the guns, there was\r\na deceptive gentleness, a forced and patient obedience of wild beasts\r\nin a cage, with their eyes on the tamer, ready to spring on his neck if\r\nhe turned his back. The Company, who were being ruined by this death\r\nof work, talked of hiring miners from the Borinage, on the Belgian\r\nfrontier, but did not dare; so that the battle continued as before\r\nbetween the colliers, who were shut up at home, and the dead pits\r\nguarded by soldiery.\r\n\r\nOn the morrow of that terrible day this calm had come about at once,\r\nhiding such a panic that the greatest silence possible was kept\r\nconcerning the damage and the atrocities. The inquiry which had been\r\nopened showed that Maigrat had died from his fall, and the frightful\r\nmutilation of the corpse remained uncertain, already surrounded by a\r\nlegend. On its side, the Company did not acknowledge the disasters it\r\nhad suffered, any more than the Gr\xc3\xa9goires cared to compromise their\r\ndaughter in the scandal of a trial in which she would have to give\r\nevidence. However, some arrests took place, mere supernumeraries as\r\nusual, silly and frightened, knowing nothing. By mistake, Pierron was\r\ntaken off with handcuffs on his wrists as far as Marchiennes, to the\r\ngreat amusement of his mates. Rasseneur, also, was nearly arrested\r\nby two gendarmes. The management was content with preparing lists\r\nof names and giving back certificates in large numbers. Maheu had\r\nreceived his, Levaque also, as well as thirty-four of their mates in\r\nthe settlement of the Deux-Cent-Quarante alone. And all the severity\r\nwas directed against \xc3\x89tienne, who had disappeared on the evening of\r\nthe fray, and who was being sought, although no trace of him could be\r\nfound. Chaval, in his hatred, had denounced him, refusing to name the\r\nothers at Catherine\'s appeal, for she wished to save her parents. The\r\ndays passed, every one felt that nothing was yet concluded; and with\r\noppressed hearts every one was awaiting the end.\r\n\r\nAt Montsou, during this period, the inhabitants awoke with a start\r\nevery night, their ears buzzing with an imaginary alarm-bell and their\r\nnostrils haunted by the smell of powder. But what completed their\r\ndiscomfiture was a sermon by the new cur\xc3\xa9, Abb\xc3\xa9 Ranvier, that lean\r\npriest with eyes like red-hot coals who had succeeded Abb\xc3\xa9 Joire. He\r\nwas indeed unlike the smiling discreet man, so fat and gentle, whose\r\nonly anxiety was to live at peace with everybody. Abb\xc3\xa9 Ranvier went\r\nso far as to defend these abominable brigands who had dishonoured the\r\ndistrict. He found excuses for the atrocities of the strikers; he\r\nviolently attacked the middle class, throwing on them the whole of\r\nthe responsibility. It was the middle class which, by dispossessing\r\nthe Church of its ancient liberties in order to misuse them itself,\r\nhad turned this world into a cursed place of injustice and suffering;\r\nit was the middle class which prolonged misunderstandings, which was\r\npushing on towards a terrible catastrophe by its atheism, by its\r\nrefusal to return to the old beliefs, to the fraternity of the early\r\nChristians. And he dared to threaten the rich. He warned them that if\r\nthey obstinately persisted in refusing to listen to the voice of God,\r\nGod would surely put Himself on the side of the poor. He would take\r\nback their fortunes from those who faithlessly enjoyed them, and would\r\ndistribute them to the humble of the earth for the triumph of His\r\nglory. The devout trembled at this; the lawyer declared that it was\r\nSocialism of the worst kind; all saw the cur\xc3\xa9 at the head of a band,\r\nbrandishing a cross, and with vigorous blows demolishing the bourgeois\r\nsociety of \'89.\r\n\r\nM. Hennebeau, when informed, contented himself with saying, as he\r\nshrugged his shoulders:\r\n\r\n"If he troubles us too much the bishop will free us from him."\r\n\r\nAnd while the breath of panic was thus blowing from one end of the\r\nplain to the other, \xc3\x89tienne was dwelling beneath the earth, in\r\nJeanlin\'s burrow at the bottom of R\xc3\xa9quillart. It was there that he was\r\nin hiding; no one believed him so near; the quiet audacity of that\r\nrefuge, in the very mine, in that abandoned passage of the old pit,\r\nhad baffled search. Above, the sloes and hawthorns growing among the\r\nfallen scaffolding of the belfry filled up the mouth of the hole. No\r\none ventured down; it was necessary to know the trick--how to hang on\r\nto the roots of the mountain ash and to let go fearlessly, to catch\r\nhold of the rungs that were still solid. Other obstacles also protected\r\nhim, the suffocating heat of the passage, a hundred and twenty metres\r\nof dangerous descent, then the painful gliding on all fours for a\r\nquarter of a league between the narrowed walls of the gallery before\r\ndiscovering the brigand\'s cave full of plunder. He lived there in the\r\nmidst of abundance, finding gin there, the rest of the dried cod, and\r\nprovisions of all sorts. The large hay bed was excellent, and not a\r\ncurrent of air could be felt in this equal temperature, as warm as a\r\nbath. Light, however, threatened to fail. Jeanlin, who had made himself\r\npurveyor, with the prudence and discretion of a savage and delighted\r\nto make fun of the police, had even brought him pomatum, but could not\r\nsucceed in putting his hands on a packet of candles.\r\n\r\nAfter the fifth day \xc3\x89tienne never lighted up except to eat. He could\r\nnot swallow in the dark. This complete and interminable night, always\r\nof the same blackness, was his chief torment. It was in vain that he\r\nwas able to sleep in safety, that he was warm and provided with bread,\r\nthe night had never weighed so heavily on his brain. It seemed to him\r\neven to crush his thoughts. Now he was living on thefts. In spite of\r\nhis communistic theories, old scruples of education arose, and he\r\ncontented himself with gnawing his share of dry bread. But what was to\r\nbe done? One must live, and his task was not yet accomplished. Another\r\nshame overcame him: remorse for that savage drunkenness from the gin,\r\ndrunk in the great cold on an empty stomach, which had thrown him,\r\narmed with a knife, on Chaval. This stirred in him the whole of that\r\nunknown terror, the hereditary ill, the long ancestry of drunkenness,\r\nno longer tolerating a drop of alcohol without falling into homicidal\r\nmania. Would he then end as a murderer? When he found himself in\r\nshelter, in this profound calm of the earth, seized by satiety of\r\nviolence, he had slept for two days the sleep of a brute, gorged and\r\novercome; and the depression continued, he lived in a bruised state\r\nwith bitter mouth and aching head, as after some tremendous spree. A\r\nweek passed by; the Maheus, who had been warned, were not able to send\r\na candle; he had to give up the enjoyment of light, even when eating.\r\n\r\nNow \xc3\x89tienne remained for hours stretched out on his hay. Vague ideas\r\nwere working within him for the first time: a feeling of superiority,\r\nwhich placed him apart from his mates, an exaltation of his person\r\nas he grew more instructed. Never had he reflected so much; he\r\nasked himself the why of his disgust on the morrow of that furious\r\ncourse among the pits; and he did not dare to reply to himself, his\r\nrecollections were repulsive to him, the ignoble desires, the coarse\r\ninstincts, the odour of all that wretchedness shaken out to the wind.\r\nIn spite of the torment of the darkness, he would come to hate the hour\r\nfor returning to the settlement. How nauseous were all these wretches\r\nin a heap, living at the common bucket! There was not one with whom he\r\ncould seriously talk politics; it was a bestial existence, always the\r\nsame air tainted by onion, in which one choked! He wished to enlarge\r\ntheir horizon, to raise them to the comfort and good manners of the\r\nmiddle class, by making them masters; but how long it would take!\r\nand he no longer felt the courage to await victory, in this prison\r\nof hunger. By slow degrees his vanity of leadership, his constant\r\npreoccupation of thinking in their place, left him free, breathing into\r\nhim the soul of one of those bourgeois whom he execrated.\r\n\r\nJeanlin one evening brought a candle-end, stolen from a carter\'s\r\nlantern, and this was a great relief for \xc3\x89tienne. When the darkness\r\nbegan to stupefy him, weighing on his skull almost to madness, he\r\nwould light up for a moment; then, as soon as he had chased away the\r\nnightmare, he extinguished the candle, miserly of this brightness which\r\nwas as necessary to his life as bread. The silence buzzed in his ears,\r\nhe only heard the flight of a band of rats, the cracking of the old\r\ntimber, the tiny sound of a spider weaving her web. And with eyes open,\r\nin this warm nothingness, he returned to his fixed idea--the thought\r\nof what his mates were doing above. Desertion on his part would have\r\nseemed to him the worst cowardice. If he thus hid himself, it was to\r\nremain free, to give counsel or to act. His long meditations had fixed\r\nhis ambition. While awaiting something better he would like to be\r\nPluchart, leaving manual work in order to work only at politics, but\r\nalone, in a clean room, under the pretext that brain labour absorbs the\r\nentire life and needs quiet.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the second week, the child having told him that\r\nthe police supposed he had gone over to Belgium, \xc3\x89tienne ventured out\r\nof his hole at nightfall. He wished to ascertain the situation, and\r\nto decide if it was still well to persist. He himself considered the\r\ngame doubtful. Before the strike he felt uncertain of the result, and\r\nhad simply yielded to facts; and now, after having been intoxicated\r\nwith rebellion, he came back to this first doubt, despairing of making\r\nthe Company yield. But he would not yet confess this to himself; he\r\nwas tortured when he thought of the miseries of defeat, and the heavy\r\nresponsibility of suffering which would weigh upon him. The end of the\r\nstrike: was it not the end of his part, the overthrow of his ambition,\r\nhis life falling back into the brutishness of the mine and the horrors\r\nof the settlement? And honestly, without any base calculation or\r\nfalsehood, he endeavoured to find his faith again, to prove to himself\r\nthat resistance was still possible, that Capital was about to destroy\r\nitself in face of the heroic suicide of Labour.\r\n\r\nThroughout the entire country, in fact, there was nothing but a long\r\necho of ruin. At night, when he wandered through the black country,\r\nlike a wolf who has come out of his forest, he seemed to hear the crash\r\nof bankruptcies from one end of the plain to the other. He now passed\r\nby the roadside nothing but closed dead workshops, becoming rotten\r\nbeneath the dull sky. The sugar works had especially suffered: the\r\nHoton sugar works, the Fauvelle works, after having reduced the number\r\nof their hands, had come to grief one after the other. At the Dutilleul\r\nflour works the last mill had stopped on the second Saturday of the\r\nmonth, and the Bleuze rope works, for mine cables, had been quite\r\nruined by the strike. On the Marchiennes side the situation was growing\r\nworse every day. All the fires were out at the Gagebois glass works,\r\nmen were continually being sent away from the Sonneville workshops,\r\nonly one of the three blast furnaces of the Forges was alight, and not\r\none battery of coke ovens was burning on the horizon. The strike of the\r\nMontsou colliers, born of the industrial crisis which had been growing\r\nworse for two years, had increased it and precipitated the downfall.\r\nTo the other causes of suffering--the stoppage of orders from America,\r\nand the engorgement of invested capital in excessive production--was\r\nnow added the unforeseen lack of coal for the few furnaces which were\r\nstill kept up; and that was the supreme agony, this engine bread which\r\nthe pits no longer furnished. Frightened by the general anxiety, the\r\nCompany, by diminishing its output and starving its miners, inevitably\r\nfound itself at the end of December without a fragment of coal at\r\nthe surface of its pits. Everything held together, the plague blew\r\nfrom afar, one fall led to another; the industries tumbled each other\r\nover as they fell, in so rapid a series of catastrophes that the\r\nshocks echoed in the midst of the neighbouring cities, Lille, Douai,\r\nValenciennes, where absconding bankers were bringing ruin on whole\r\nfamilies.\r\n\r\nAt the turn of a road \xc3\x89tienne often stopped in the frozen night to\r\nhear the rubbish raining down. He breathed deeply in the darkness,\r\nthe joy of annihilation seized him, the hope that day would dawn on\r\nthe extermination of the old world, with not a single fortune left\r\nstanding, the scythe of equality levelling everything to the ground.\r\nBut in this massacre it was the Company\'s pits that especially\r\ninterested him. He would continue his walk, blinded by the darkness,\r\nvisiting them one after the other, glad to discover some new disaster.\r\nLandslips of increasing gravity continued to occur on account of the\r\nprolonged abandonment of the passages. Above the north gallery of\r\nMirou the ground sank in to such an extent, that the Joiselle road,\r\nfor the distance of a hundred metres, had been swallowed up as though\r\nby the shock of an earthquake; and the Company, disturbed at the\r\nrumours raised by these accidents, paid the owners for their vanished\r\nfields without bargaining. Cr\xc3\xa9vecoeur and Madeleine, which lay in very\r\nshifting rock, were becoming stopped up more and more. It was said that\r\ntwo captains had been buried at the Victoire; there was an inundation\r\nat Feutry-Cantel, it had been necessary to wall up a gallery for the\r\nlength of a kilometre at Saint-Thomas, where the ill-kept timbering\r\nwas breaking down everywhere. Thus every hour enormous sums were\r\nspent, making great breaches in the shareholders\' dividends; a rapid\r\ndestruction of the pits was going on, which must end at last by eating\r\nup the famous Montsou deniers which had been centupled in a century.\r\n\r\nIn the face of these repeated blows, hope was again born in \xc3\x89tienne;\r\nhe came to believe that a third month of resistance would crush the\r\nmonster--the weary, sated beast, crouching down there like an idol\r\nin his unknown tabernacle. He knew that after the Montsou troubles\r\nthere had been great excitement in the Paris journals, quite a violent\r\ncontroversy between the official newspapers and the opposition\r\nnewspapers, terrible narratives, which were especially directed against\r\nthe International, of which the empire was becoming afraid after having\r\nfirst encouraged it; and the directors not daring to turn a deaf ear\r\nany longer, two of them had condescended to come and hold an inquiry,\r\nbut with an air of regret, not appearing to care about the upshot; so\r\ndisinterested, that in three days they went away again, declaring that\r\neverything was going on as well as possible. He was told, however, from\r\nother quarters that during their stay these gentlemen sat permanently,\r\ndisplaying feverish activity, and absorbed in transactions of which\r\nno one about them uttered a word. And he charged them with affecting\r\nconfidence they did not feel, and came to look upon their departure as\r\na nervous flight, feeling now certain of triumph since these terrible\r\nmen were letting everything go.\r\n\r\nBut on the following night \xc3\x89tienne despaired again. The Company\'s\r\nback was too robust to be so easily broken; they might lose millions,\r\nbut later on they would get them back again by gnawing at their men\'s\r\nbread. On that night, having pushed as far as Jean-Bart, he guessed\r\nthe truth when an overseer told him that there was talk of yielding\r\nVandame to Montsou. At Deneulin\'s house, it was said, the wretchedness\r\nwas pitiful, the wretchedness of the rich; the father ill in his\r\npowerlessness, aged by his anxiety over money, the daughters struggling\r\nin the midst of tradesmen, trying to save their shifts. There was\r\nless suffering in the famished settlements than in this middle-class\r\nhouse where they shut themselves up to drink water. Work had not been\r\nresumed at Jean-Bart, and it had been necessary to replace the pump\r\nat Gaston-Marie; while, in spite of all haste, an inundation had\r\nalready begun which made great expenses necessary. Deneulin had at\r\nlast risked his request for a loan of one hundred thousand francs from\r\nthe Gr\xc3\xa9goires, and the refusal, though he had expected it, completed\r\nhis dejection: if they refused, it was for his sake, in order to save\r\nhim from an impossible struggle; and they advised him to sell. He, as\r\nusual, violently refused. It enraged him to have to pay the expenses of\r\nthe strike; he hoped at first to die of it, with the blood at his head,\r\nstrangled by apoplexy. Then what was to be done? He had listened to the\r\ndirectors\' offers. They wrangled with him, they depreciated this superb\r\nprey, this repaired pit, equipped anew, where the lack of capital alone\r\nparalysed the output. He would be lucky if he got enough out of it\r\nto satisfy his creditors. For two days he had struggled against the\r\ndirectors at Montsou, furious at the quiet way with which they took\r\nadvantage of his embarrassment and shouting his refusals at them in\r\nhis loud voice. And there the affair remained, and they had returned\r\nto Paris to await patiently his last groans. \xc3\x89tienne smelled out this\r\ncompensation for the disasters, and was again seized by discouragement\r\nbefore the invincible power of the great capitalists, so strong in\r\nbattle that they fattened in defeat by eating the corpses of the small\r\ncapitalists who fell at their side.\r\n\r\nThe next day, fortunately, Jeanlin brought him a piece of good news. At\r\nthe Voreux the tubbing of the shaft was threatening to break, and the\r\nwater was filtering in from all the joints; in great haste a gang of\r\ncarpenters had been set on to repair it.\r\n\r\nUp to now \xc3\x89tienne had avoided the Voreux, warned by the everlasting\r\nblack silhouette of the sentinel stationed on the pit-bank above the\r\nplain. He could not be avoided, he dominated in the air, like the flag\r\nof the regiment. Towards three o\'clock in the morning the sky became\r\novercast, and he went to the pit, where some mates explained to him\r\nthe bad condition of the tubbing; they even thought that it would have\r\nto be done entirely over again, which would stop the output of coal\r\nfor three months. For a long time he prowled round, listening to the\r\ncarpenters\' mallets hammering in the shaft. That wound which had to be\r\ndressed rejoiced his heart.\r\n\r\nAs he went back in the early daylight, he saw the sentinel still on the\r\npit-bank. This time he would certainly be seen. As he walked he thought\r\nabout those soldiers who were taken from the people, to be armed\r\nagainst the people. How easy the triumph of the revolution would be if\r\nthe army were suddenly to declare for it! It would be enough if the\r\nworkman and the peasant in the barracks were to remember their origin.\r\nThat was the supreme peril, the great terror, which made the teeth of\r\nthe middle class chatter when they thought of a possible defection of\r\nthe troops. In two hours they would be swept away and exterminated\r\nwith all the delights and abominations of their iniquitous life. It\r\nwas already said that whole regiments were tainted with Socialism.\r\nWas it true? When justice came, would it be thanks to the cartridges\r\ndistributed by the middle class? And snatching at another hope, the\r\nyoung man dreamed that the regiment, with its posts, now guarding the\r\npits, would come over to the side of the strikers, shoot down the\r\nCompany to a man, and at last give the mine to the miners.\r\n\r\nHe then noticed that he was ascending the pit-bank, his head filled\r\nwith these reflections. Why should he not talk with this soldier? He\r\nwould get to know what his ideas were. With an air of indifference, he\r\ncontinued to come nearer, as though he were gleaning old wood among the\r\nrubbish. The sentinel remained motionless.\r\n\r\n"Eh! mate! damned weather," said \xc3\x89tienne, at last. "I think we shall\r\nhave snow."\r\n\r\nHe was a small soldier, very fair, with a pale, gentle face covered\r\nwith red freckles. He wore his military great-coat with the awkwardness\r\nof a recruit.\r\n\r\n"Yes, perhaps we shall, I think," he murmured.\r\n\r\nAnd with his blue eyes he gazed at the livid sky, the smoky dawn, with\r\nsoot weighing like lead afar over the plain.\r\n\r\n"What idiots they are to put you here to freeze!" \xc3\x89tienne went on. "One\r\nwould think the Cossacks were coming! And then there\'s always wind\r\nhere."\r\n\r\nThe little soldier shivered without complaining. There was certainly\r\na little cabin of dry stones there, where old Bonnemort used to take\r\nshelter when it blew a hurricane, but the order being not to leave the\r\nsummit of the pit-bank, the soldier did not stir from it, his hands so\r\nstiffened by cold that he could no longer feel his weapon. He belonged\r\nto the guard of sixty men who were protecting the Voreux, and as this\r\ncruel sentry-duty frequently came round, he had before nearly stayed\r\nthere for good with his dead feet. His work demanded it; a passive\r\nobedience finished the benumbing process, and he replied to these\r\nquestions with the stammered words of a sleepy child.\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne in vain endeavoured during a quarter of an hour to make\r\nhim talk about politics. He replied "yes" or "no" without seeming\r\nto understand. Some of his comrades said that the captain was a\r\nrepublican; as to him, he had no idea--it was all the same to him.\r\nIf he was ordered to fire, he would fire, so as not to be punished.\r\nThe workman listened, seized with the popular hatred against the\r\narmy--against these brothers whose hearts were changed by sticking a\r\npair of red pantaloons on to their buttocks.\r\n\r\n"Then what\'s your name?"\r\n\r\n"Jules."\r\n\r\n"And where do you come from?"\r\n\r\n"From Plogof, over there."\r\n\r\nHe stretched out his arm at random. It was in Brittany, he knew no\r\nmore. His small pale face grew animated. He began to laugh, and felt\r\nwarmer.\r\n\r\n"I have a mother and a sister. They are waiting for me, sure enough.\r\nAh! it won\'t be for to-morrow. When I left, they came with me as far as\r\nPont-l\'Abb\xc3\xa9. We had to take the horse to Lepalmec: it nearly broke its\r\nlegs at the bottom of the Audierne Hill. Cousin Charles was waiting for\r\nus with sausages, but the women were crying too much, and it stuck in\r\nour throats. Good Lord! what a long way off our home is!"\r\n\r\nHis eyes grew moist, though he was still laughing. The desert moorland\r\nof Plogof, that wild storm-beaten point of the Raz, appeared to him\r\nbeneath a dazzling sun in the rosy season of heather.\r\n\r\n"Do you think," he asked, "if I\'m not punished, that they\'ll give me a\r\nmonth\'s leave in two years?"\r\n\r\nThen \xc3\x89tienne talked about Provence, which he had left when he was quite\r\nsmall. The daylight was growing, and flakes of snow began to fly in\r\nthe earthy sky. And at last he felt anxious on noticing Jeanlin, who\r\nwas prowling about in the midst of the bushes, stupefied to see him\r\nup there. The child was beckoning to him. What was the good of this\r\ndream of fraternizing with the soldiers? It would take years and years,\r\nand his useless attempt cast him down as though he had expected to\r\nsucceed. But suddenly he understood Jeanlin\'s gesture. The sentinel was\r\nabout to be relieved, and he went away, running off to bury himself at\r\nR\xc3\xa9quillart, his heart crushed once more by the certainty of defeat;\r\nwhile the little scamp who ran beside him was accusing that dirty beast\r\nof a trooper of having called out the guard to fire at them.\r\n\r\nOn the summit of the pit-bank Jules stood motionless, with eyes\r\nvacantly gazing at the falling snow. The sergeant was approaching with\r\nhis men, and the regulation cries were exchanged.\r\n\r\n"_Qui vive?_--Advance and give the password!"\r\n\r\nAnd they heard the heavy steps begin again, ringing as though on a\r\nconquered country. In spite of the growing daylight, nothing stirred\r\nin the settlements; the colliers remained in silent rage beneath the\r\nmilitary boot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nSnow had been falling for two days; since the morning it had ceased,\r\nand an intense frost had frozen the immense sheet. This black country,\r\nwith its inky roads and walls and trees powdered with coal dust,\r\nwas now white, a single whiteness stretching out without end. The\r\nDeux-Cent-Quarante settlement lay beneath the snow as though it had\r\ndisappeared. No smoke came out of the chimneys; the houses, without\r\nfire and as cold as the stones in the street, did not melt the thick\r\nlayer on the tiles. It was nothing more than a quarry of white slabs\r\nin the white plain, a vision of a dead village wound in its shroud.\r\nAlong the roads the passing patrols alone made a muddy mess with their\r\nstamping.\r\n\r\nAmong the Maheus the last shovelful of cinders had been burnt the\r\nevening before, and it was no use any longer to think of gleaning on\r\nthe pit-bank in this terrible weather, when the sparrows themselves\r\ncould not find a blade of grass. Alzire, from the obstinacy with which\r\nher poor hands had dug in the snow, was dying. Maheude had to wrap her\r\nup in the fragment of a coverlet while waiting for Dr. Vanderhaghen,\r\nfor whom she had twice gone out without being able to find him. The\r\nservant had, however, promised that he would come to the settlement\r\nbefore night, and the mother was standing at the window watching, while\r\nthe little invalid, who had wished to be downstairs, was shivering\r\non a chair, having the illusion that it was better there near the\r\ncold grate. Old Bonnemort opposite, his legs bad once more, seemed\r\nto be sleeping; neither L\xc3\xa9nore nor Henri had come back from scouring\r\nthe roads, in company with Jeanlin, to ask for sous. Maheu alone was\r\nwalking heavily up and down the bare room, stumbling against the wall\r\nat every turn, with the stupid air of an animal which can no longer see\r\nits cage. The petroleum also was finished; but the reflection of the\r\nsnow from outside was so bright that it vaguely lit up the room, in\r\nspite of the deepening night.\r\n\r\nThere was a noise of sabots, and the Levaque woman pushed open the\r\ndoor like a gale of wind, beside herself, shouting furiously from the\r\nthreshold at Maheude:\r\n\r\n"Then it\'s you who have said that I forced my lodger to give me twenty\r\nsous when he sleeps with me?"\r\n\r\nThe other shrugged her shoulders.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t bother me. I said nothing; and who told you so?"\r\n\r\n"They tell me you said so; it doesn\'t concern you who it was. You even\r\nsaid you could hear us at our dirty tricks behind the wall, and that\r\nthe filth gets into our house because I\'m always on my back. Just tell\r\nme you didn\'t say so, eh?"\r\n\r\nEvery day quarrels broke out as a result of the constant gossiping of\r\nthe women. Especially between those households which lived door to\r\ndoor, squabbles and reconciliations took place every day. But never\r\nbefore had such bitterness thrown them one against the other. Since the\r\nstrike hunger exasperated their rancour, so that they felt the need\r\nof blows; an altercation between two gossiping women finished by a\r\nmurderous onset between their two men.\r\n\r\nJust then Levaque arrived in his turn, dragging Bouteloup.\r\n\r\n"Here\'s our mate; let him just say if he has given twenty sous to my\r\nwife to sleep with her."\r\n\r\nThe lodger, hiding his timid gentleness in his great beard, protested\r\nand stammered:\r\n\r\n"Oh, that? No! Never anything! never!"\r\n\r\nAt once Levaque became threatening, and thrust his fist beneath Maheu\'s\r\nnose.\r\n\r\n"You know that won\'t do for me. If a man\'s got a wife like that, he\r\nought to knock her ribs in. If not, then you believe what she says."\r\n\r\n"By God!" exclaimed Maheu, furious at being dragged out of his\r\ndejection, "what is all this clatter again? Haven\'t we got enough to do\r\nwith our misery? Just leave me alone, damn you! or I\'ll let you know\r\nit! And first, who says that my wife said so?"\r\n\r\n"Who says so? Pierronne said so."\r\n\r\nMaheude broke into a sharp laugh, and turning towards the Levaque woman:\r\n\r\n"An! Pierronne, is it? Well! I can tell you what she told me. Yes, she\r\ntold me that you sleep with both your men--the one underneath and the\r\nother on top!"\r\n\r\nAfter that it was no longer possible to come to an understanding. They\r\nall grew angry, and the Levaques, as a reply to the Maheus, asserted\r\nthat Pierronne had said a good many other things on their account; that\r\nthey had sold Catherine, that they were all rotten together, even to\r\nthe little ones, with a dirty disease caught by \xc3\x89tienne at the Volcan.\r\n\r\n"She said that! She said that!" yelled Maheu. "Good! I\'ll go to her, I\r\nwill, and if she says that she said that, she shall feel my hand on her\r\nchops!"\r\n\r\nHe was carried out of himself, and the Levaques followed him to see\r\nwhat would happen, while Bouteloup, having a horror of disputes,\r\nfurtively returned home. Excited by the altercation, Maheude was also\r\ngoing out, when a complaint from Alzire held her back. She crossed the\r\nends of the coverlet over the little one\'s quivering body, and placed\r\nherself before the window, looking out vaguely. And that doctor, who\r\nstill delayed!\r\n\r\nAt the Pierrons\' door Maheu and the Levaques met Lydie, who was\r\nstamping in the snow. The house was closed, and a thread of light\r\ncame though a crack in a shutter. The child replied at first to their\r\nquestions with constraint: no, her father was not there, he had gone to\r\nthe washhouse to join Mother Brul\xc3\xa9 and bring back the bundle of linen.\r\nThen she was confused, and would not say what her mother was doing.\r\nAt last she let out everything with a sly, spiteful laugh: her mother\r\nhad pushed her out of the door because M. Dansaert was there, and she\r\nprevented them from talking. Since the morning he had been going about\r\nthe settlement with two policemen, trying to pick up workmen, imposing\r\non the weak, and announcing everywhere that if the descent did not take\r\nplace on Monday at the Voreux, the Company had decided to hire men from\r\nthe Borinage. And as the night came on he sent away the policemen,\r\nfinding Pierronne alone; then he had remained with her to drink a glass\r\nof gin before a good fire.\r\n\r\n"Hush! hold your tongue! We must see them," said Levaque, with a lewd\r\nlaugh. "We\'ll explain everything directly. Get off with you, youngster."\r\n\r\nLydie drew back a few steps while he put his eye to a crack in the\r\nshutter. He stifled a low cry and his back bent with a quiver. In her\r\nturn his wife looked through, but she said, as though taken by the\r\ncolic, that it was disgusting. Maheu, who had pushed her, wishing also\r\nto see, then declared that he had had enough for his money. And they\r\nbegan again, in a row, each taking his glance as at a peep-show. The\r\nparlour, glittering with cleanliness, was enlivened by a large fire;\r\nthere were cakes on the table with a bottle and glasses, in fact quite\r\na feast. What they saw going on in there at last exasperated the two\r\nmen, who under other circumstances would have laughed over it for six\r\nmonths. That she should let herself be stuffed up to the neck, with\r\nher skirts in the air, was funny. But, good God! was it not disgusting\r\nto do that in front of a great fire, and to get up one\'s strength with\r\nbiscuits, when the mates had neither a slice of bread nor a fragment of\r\ncoal?\r\n\r\n"Here\'s father!" cried Lydie, running away.\r\n\r\nPierron was quietly coming back from the washhouse with the bundle of\r\nlinen on his shoulder. Maheu immediately addressed him:\r\n\r\n"Here! they tell me that your wife says that I sold Catherine, and that\r\nwe are all rotten at home. And what do they pay you in your house, your\r\nwife and the gentleman who is this minute wearing out her skin?"\r\n\r\nThe astonished Pierron could not understand, and Pierronne, seized\r\nwith fear on hearing the tumult of voices, lost her head and set the\r\ndoor ajar to see what was the matter. They could see her, looking very\r\nred, with her dress open and her skirt tucked up at her waist; while\r\nDansaert, in the background, was wildly buttoning himself up. The head\r\ncaptain rushed away and disappeared trembling with fear that this story\r\nwould reach the manager\'s ears. Then there would be an awful scandal,\r\nlaughter, and hooting and abuse.\r\n\r\n"You, who are always saying that other people are dirty!" shouted the\r\nLevaque woman to Pierronne; "it\'s not surprising that you\'re clean when\r\nyou get the bosses to scour you."\r\n\r\n"Ah! it\'s fine for her to talk!" said Levaque again. "Here\'s a trollop\r\nwho says that my wife sleeps with me and the lodger, one below and the\r\nother above! Yes! yes! that\'s what they tell me you say."\r\n\r\nBut Pierronne, grown calm, held her own against this abuse, very\r\ncontemptuous in the assurance that she was the best looking and the\r\nrichest.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve said what I\'ve said; just leave me alone, will you! What have my\r\naffairs got to do with you, a pack of jealous creatures who want to get\r\nover us because we are able to save up money! Get along! get along!\r\nYou can say what you like; my husband knows well enough why Monsieur\r\nDansaert was here."\r\n\r\nPierron, in fact, was furiously defending his wife. The quarrel turned.\r\nThey accused him of having sold himself, of being a spy, the Company\'s\r\ndog; they charged him with shutting himself up, to gorge himself with\r\nthe good things with which the bosses paid him for his treachery.\r\nIn defence, he pretended that Maheu had slipped beneath his door a\r\nthreatening paper with two cross-bones and a dagger above. And this\r\nnecessarily ended in a struggle between the men, as the quarrels of the\r\nwomen always did now that famine was enraging the mildest. Maheu and\r\nLevaque rushed on Pierron with their fists, and had to be pulled off.\r\n\r\nBlood was flowing from her son-in-law\'s nose, when Mother Brul\xc3\xa9, in her\r\nturn, arrived from the washhouse. When informed of what had been going\r\non, she merely said:\r\n\r\n"The damned beast dishonours me!"\r\n\r\nThe road was becoming deserted, not a shadow spotted the naked\r\nwhiteness of the snow, and the settlement, falling back into its\r\ndeath-like immobility, went on starving beneath the intense cold.\r\n\r\n"And the doctor?" asked Maheu, as he shut the door.\r\n\r\n"Not come," replied Maheude, still standing before the window.\r\n\r\n"Are the little ones back?"\r\n\r\n"No, not back."\r\n\r\nMaheu again began his heavy walk from one wall to the other, looking\r\nlike a stricken ox. Father Bonnemort, seated stiffly on his chair, had\r\nnot even lifted his head. Alzire also had said nothing, and was trying\r\nnot to shiver, so as to avoid giving them pain; but in spite of her\r\ncourage in suffering, she sometimes trembled so much that one could\r\nhear against the coverlet the quivering of the little invalid girl\'s\r\nlean body, while with her large open eyes she stared at the ceiling,\r\nfrom which the pale reflection of the white gardens lit up the room\r\nlike moonshine.\r\n\r\nThe emptied house was now in its last agony, having reached a final\r\nstage of nakedness. The mattress ticks had followed the wool to the\r\ndealers; then the sheets had gone, the linen, everything that could be\r\nsold. One evening they had sold a handkerchief of the grandfather\'s for\r\ntwo sous. Tears fell over each object of the poor household which had\r\nto go, and the mother was still lamenting that one day she had carried\r\naway in her skirt the pink cardboard box, her man\'s old present, as one\r\nwould carry away a child to get rid of it on some doorstep. They were\r\nbare; they had only their skins left to sell, so worn-out and injured\r\nthat no one would have given a farthing for them. They no longer even\r\ntook the trouble to search, they knew that there was nothing left, that\r\nthey had come to the end of everything, that they must not hope even\r\nfor a candle, or a fragment of coal, or a potato, and they were waiting\r\nto die, only grieved about the children, and revolted by the useless\r\ncruelty that gave the little one a disease before starving it.\r\n\r\n"At last! here he is!" said Maheude.\r\n\r\nA black figure passed before the window. The door opened. But it was\r\nnot Dr. Vanderhaghen; they recognized the new cur\xc3\xa9, Abb\xc3\xa9 Ranvier, who\r\ndid not seem surprised at coming on this dead house, without light,\r\nwithout fire, without bread. He had already been to three neighbouring\r\nhouses, going from family to family, seeking willing listeners, like\r\nDansaert with his two policemen; and at once he exclaimed, in his\r\nfeverish fanatic\'s voice:\r\n\r\n"Why were you not at mass on Sunday, my children? You are wrong, the\r\nChurch alone can save you. Now promise me to come next Sunday."\r\n\r\nMaheu, after staring at him, went on pacing heavily, without a word. It\r\nwas Maheude who replied:\r\n\r\n"To mass, sir? What for? Isn\'t the good God making fun of us? Look\r\nhere! what has my little girl there done to Him, to be shaking with\r\nfever? Hadn\'t we enough misery, that He had to make her ill too, just\r\nwhen I can\'t even give her a cup of warm gruel?"\r\n\r\nThen the priest stood and talked at length. He spoke of the strike,\r\nthis terrible wretchedness, this exasperated rancour of famine, with\r\nthe ardour of a missionary who is preaching to savages for the glory\r\nof religion. He said that the Church was with the poor, that she would\r\none day cause justice to triumph by calling down the anger of God on\r\nthe iniquities of the rich. And that day would come soon, for the rich\r\nhad taken the place of God, and were governing without God, in their\r\nimpious theft of power. But if the workers desired the fair division\r\nof the goods of the earth, they ought at once to put themselves in the\r\nhands of the priests, just as on the death of Jesus the poor and the\r\nhumble grouped themselves around the apostles. What strength the pope\r\nwould have, what an army the clergy would have under them, when they\r\nwere able to command the numberless crowd of workers! In one week they\r\nwould purge the world of the wicked, they would chase away the unworthy\r\nmasters. Then, indeed, there would be a real kingdom of God, every\r\none recompensed according to his merits, and the law of labour as the\r\nfoundation for universal happiness.\r\n\r\nMaheude, who was listening to him, seemed to hear \xc3\x89tienne, in those\r\nautumn evenings when he announced to them the end of their evils. Only\r\nshe had always distrusted the cloth.\r\n\r\n"That\'s very well, what you say there, sir," she replied, "but that\'s\r\nbecause you no longer agree with the bourgeois. All our other cur\xc3\xa9s\r\ndined at the manager\'s, and threatened us with the devil as soon as we\r\nasked for bread."\r\n\r\nHe began again, and spoke of the deplorable misunderstanding between\r\nthe Church and the people. Now, in veiled phrases, he hit at the\r\ntown cur\xc3\xa9s, at the bishops, at the highly placed clergy, sated with\r\nenjoyment, gorged with domination, making pacts with the liberal middle\r\nclass, in the imbecility of their blindness, not seeing that it was\r\nthis middle class which had dispossessed them of the empire of the\r\nworld. Deliverance would come from the country priests, who would all\r\nrise to re-establish the kingdom of Christ, with the help of the poor;\r\nand already he seemed to be at their head; he raised his bony form like\r\nthe chief of a band, a revolutionary of the gospel, his eyes so filled\r\nwith light that they illuminated the gloomy room. This enthusiastic\r\nsermon lifted him to mystic heights, and the poor people had long\r\nceased to understand him.\r\n\r\n"No need for so many words," growled Maheu suddenly. "You\'d best begin\r\nby bringing us a loaf."\r\n\r\n"Come on Sunday to mass," cried the priest. "God will provide for\r\neverything."\r\n\r\nAnd he went off to catechize the Levaques in their turn, so carried\r\naway by his dream of the final triumph of the Church, and so\r\ncontemptuous of facts, that he would thus go through the settlements\r\nwithout charities, with empty hands amid this army dying of hunger,\r\nbeing a poor devil himself who looked upon suffering as the spur to\r\nsalvation.\r\n\r\nMaheu continued his pacing, and nothing was heard but his regular tramp\r\nwhich made the floor tremble. There was the sound of a rust-eaten\r\npulley; old Bonnemort was spitting into the cold grate. Then the rhythm\r\nof the feet began again. Alzire, weakened by fever, was rambling in a\r\nlow voice, laughing, thinking that it was warm and that she was playing\r\nin the sun.\r\n\r\n"Good gracious!" muttered Maheude, after having touched her cheeks,\r\n"how she burns! I don\'t expect that damned beast now, the brigands must\r\nhave stopped him from coming."\r\n\r\nShe meant the doctor and the Company. She uttered a joyous exclamation,\r\nhowever, when the door once more opened. But her arms fell back and she\r\nremained standing still with gloomy face.\r\n\r\n"Good evening," whispered \xc3\x89tienne, when he had carefully closed the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nHe often came thus at night-time. The Maheus learnt his retreat after\r\nthe second day. But they kept the secret and no one in the settlement\r\nknew exactly what had become of the young man. A legend had grown\r\nup around him. People still believed in him and mysterious rumours\r\ncirculated: he would reappear with an army and chests full of gold; and\r\nthere was always the religious expectation of a miracle, the realized\r\nideal, a sudden entry into that city of justice which he had promised\r\nthem. Some said they had seen him lying back in a carriage, with three\r\nother gentlemen, on the Marchiennes road; others affirmed that he was\r\nin England for a few days. At length, however, suspicions began to\r\narise and jokers accused him of hiding in a cellar, where Mouquette\r\nkept him warm; for this relationship, when known, had done him harm.\r\nThere was a growing disaffection in the midst of his popularity, a\r\ngradual increase of the despairing among the faithful, and their number\r\nwas certain, little by little, to grow.\r\n\r\n"What brutal weather!" he added. "And you--nothing new, always from bad\r\nto worse? They tell me that little N\xc3\xa9grel has been to Belgium to get\r\nBorains. Good God! we are done for if that is true!"\r\n\r\nHe shuddered as he entered this dark icy room, where it was some time\r\nbefore his eyes were able to see the unfortunate people whose presence\r\nhe guessed by the deepening of the shade. He was experiencing the\r\nrepugnance and discomfort of the workman who has risen above his class,\r\nrefined by study and stimulated by ambition. What wretchedness! and\r\nodours! and the bodies in a heap! And a terrible pity caught him by the\r\nthroat. The spectacle of this agony so overcame him that he tried to\r\nfind words to advise submission.\r\n\r\nBut Maheu came violently up to him, shouting:\r\n\r\n"Borains! They won\'t dare, the bloody fools! Let the Borains go down,\r\nthen, if they want us to destroy the pits!"\r\n\r\nWith an air of constraint, \xc3\x89tienne explained that it was not possible\r\nto move, that the soldiers who guarded the pits would protect the\r\ndescent of the Belgian workmen. And Maheu clenched his fists, irritated\r\nespecially, as he said, by having bayonets in his back. Then the\r\ncolliers were no longer masters in their own place? They were treated,\r\nthen, like convicts, forced to work by a loaded musket! He loved his\r\npit, it was a great grief to him not to have been down for two months.\r\nHe was driven wild, therefore, at the idea of this insult, these\r\nstrangers whom they threatened to introduce. Then the recollection that\r\nhis certificate had been given back to him struck him to the heart.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know why I\'m angry," he muttered. "I don\'t belong to their\r\nshop any longer. When they have hunted me away from here, I may as well\r\ndie on the road."\r\n\r\n"As to that," said \xc3\x89tienne, "if you like, they\'ll take your certificate\r\nback to-morrow. People don\'t send away good workmen."\r\n\r\nHe interrupted himself, surprised to hear Alzire, who was laughing\r\nsoftly in the delirium of her fever. So far he had only made out Father\r\nBonnemort\'s stiff shadow, and this gaiety of the sick child frightened\r\nhim. It was indeed too much if the little ones were going to die of it.\r\nWith trembling voice he made up his mind.\r\n\r\n"Look here! this can\'t go on, we are done for. We must give it up."\r\n\r\nMaheude, who had been motionless and silent up to now, suddenly broke\r\nout, and treating him familiarly and swearing like a man, she shouted\r\nin his face:\r\n\r\n"What\'s that you say? It\'s you who say that, by God!"\r\n\r\nHe was about to give reasons, but she would not let him speak.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t repeat that, by God! or, woman as I am, I\'ll put my fist into\r\nyour face. Then we have been dying for two months, and I have sold\r\nmy household, and my little ones have fallen ill of it, and there is\r\nto be nothing done, and the injustice is to begin again! Ah! do you\r\nknow! when I think of that my blood stands still. No, no, I would burn\r\neverything, I would kill everything, rather than give up."\r\n\r\nShe pointed at Maheu in the darkness, with a vague, threatening gesture.\r\n\r\n"Listen to this! If any man goes back to the pit, he\'ll find me waiting\r\nfor him on the road to spit in his face and cry coward!\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne could not see her, but he felt a heat like the breath of a\r\nbarking animal. He had drawn back, astonished at this fury which was\r\nhis work. She was so changed that he could no longer recognize the\r\nwoman who was once so sensible, reproving his violent schemes, saying\r\nthat we ought not to wish any one dead, and who was now refusing to\r\nlisten to reason and talking of killing people. It was not he now,\r\nit was she, who talked politics, who dreamed of sweeping away the\r\nbourgeois at a stroke, who demanded the republic and the guillotine\r\nto free the earth of these rich robbers who fattened on the labour of\r\nstarvelings.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I could flay them with my fingers. We\'ve had enough of them! Our\r\nturn is come now; you used to say so yourself. When I think of the\r\nfather, the grandfather, the grandfather\'s father, what all of them who\r\nwent before have suffered, what we are suffering, and that our sons and\r\nour sons\' sons will suffer it over again, it makes me mad--I could take\r\na knife. The other day we didn\'t do enough at Montsou; we ought to have\r\npulled the bloody place to the ground, down to the last brick. And do\r\nyou know I\'ve only one regret, that we didn\'t let the old man strangle\r\nthe Piolaine girl. Hunger may strangle my little ones for all they\r\ncare!"\r\n\r\nHer words fell like the blows of an axe in the night. The closed\r\nhorizon would not open, and the impossible ideal was turning to poison\r\nin the depths of this skull which had been crushed by grief.\r\n\r\n"You have misunderstood," \xc3\x89tienne was able to say at last, beating a\r\nretreat. "We ought to come to an understanding with the Company. I know\r\nthat the pits are suffering much, so that it would probably consent to\r\nan arrangement."\r\n\r\n"No, never!" she shouted.\r\n\r\nJust then L\xc3\xa9nore and Henri came back with their hands empty. A\r\ngentleman had certainly given them two sous, but the girl kept kicking\r\nher little brother, and the two sous fell into the snow, and as Jeanlin\r\nhad joined in the search they had not been able to find them.\r\n\r\n"Where is Jeanlin?"\r\n\r\n"He\'s gone away, mother; he said he had business."\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne was listening with an aching heart. Once she had threatened\r\nto kill them if they ever held out their hands to beg. Now she sent\r\nthem herself on to the roads, and proposed that all of them--the ten\r\nthousand colliers of Montsou--should take stick and wallet, like\r\nbeggars of old, and scour the terrified country.\r\n\r\nThe anguish continued to increase in the black room. The little urchins\r\ncame back hungry, they wanted to eat; why could they not have something\r\nto eat? And they grumbled, flung themselves about, and at last trod on\r\nthe feet of their dying sister, who groaned. The mother furiously boxed\r\ntheir ears in the darkness at random. Then, as they cried still louder,\r\nasking for bread, she burst into tears, and dropped on to the floor,\r\nseizing them in one embrace with the little invalid; then, for a long\r\ntime, her tears fell in a nervous outbreak which left her limp and worn\r\nout, stammering over and over again the same phrase, calling for death:\r\n\r\n"O God! why do you not take us? O God! in pity take us, to have done\r\nwith it!"\r\n\r\nThe grandfather preserved his immobility, like an old tree twisted\r\nby the rain and wind; while the father continued walking between the\r\nfireplace and the cupboard, without turning his head.\r\n\r\nBut the door opened, and this time it was Doctor Vanderhaghen.\r\n\r\n"The devil!" he said. "This light won\'t spoil your eyes. Look sharp!\r\nI\'m in a hurry."\r\n\r\nAs usual, he scolded, knocked up by work. Fortunately, he had matches\r\nwith him, and the father had to strike six, one by one, and to hold\r\nthem while he examined the invalid. Unwound from her coverlet, she\r\nshivered beneath this flickering light, as lean as a bird dying in the\r\nsnow, so small that one only saw her hump. But she smiled with the\r\nwandering smile of the dying, and her eyes were very large; while her\r\npoor hands contracted over her hollow breast. And as the half-choked\r\nmother asked if it was right to take away from her the only child who\r\nhelped in the household, so intelligent and gentle, the doctor grew\r\nvexed.\r\n\r\n"Ah! she is going. Dead of hunger, your blessed child. And not the only\r\none, either; I\'ve just seen another one over there. You all send for\r\nme, but I can\'t do anything; it\'s meat that you want to cure you."\r\n\r\nMaheu, with burnt fingers, had dropped the match, and the darkness\r\nclosed over the little corpse, which was still warm. The doctor had\r\ngone away in a hurry. \xc3\x89tienne heard nothing more in the black room\r\nbut Maheude\'s sobs, repeating her cry for death, that melancholy and\r\nendless lamentation:\r\n\r\n"O God! it is my turn, take me! O God! take my man, take the others,\r\nout of pity, to have done with it!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nOn that Sunday, ever since eight o\'clock, Souvarine had been sitting\r\nalone in the parlour of the Avantage, at his accustomed place, with\r\nhis head against the wall. Not a single collier knew where to get two\r\nsous for a drink, and never had the bars had fewer customers. So Madame\r\nRasseneur, motionless at the counter, preserved an irritated silence;\r\nwhile Rasseneur, standing before the iron fireplace, seemed to be\r\ngazing with a reflective air at the brown smoke from the coal.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, in this heavy silence of an over-heated room, three light\r\nquick blows struck against one of the window-panes made Souvarine turn\r\nhis head. He rose, for he recognized the signal which \xc3\x89tienne had\r\nalready used several times before, in order to call him, when he saw\r\nhim from without, smoking his cigarette at an empty table. But before\r\nthe engine-man could reach the door, Rasseneur had opened it, and,\r\nrecognizing the man who stood there in the light from the window, he\r\nsaid to him:\r\n\r\n"Are you afraid that I shall sell you? You can talk better here than on\r\nthe road."\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne entered. Madame Rasseneur politely offered him a glass, which\r\nhe refused, with a gesture. The innkeeper added:\r\n\r\n"I guessed long ago where you hide yourself. If I was a spy, as your\r\nfriends say, I should have sent the police after you a week ago."\r\n\r\n"There is no need for you to defend yourself," replied the young man.\r\n"I know that you have never eaten that sort of bread. People may have\r\ndifferent ideas and esteem each other all the same."\r\n\r\nAnd there was silence once more. Souvarine had gone back to his chair,\r\nwith his back to the wall and his eyes fixed on the smoke from his\r\ncigarette, but his feverish fingers were moving restlessly, and he ran\r\nthem over his knees, seeking the warm fur of Poland, who was absent\r\nthis evening; it was an unconscious discomfort, something that was\r\nlacking, he could not exactly say what.\r\n\r\nSeated on the other side of the table, \xc3\x89tienne at last said:\r\n\r\n"To-morrow work begins again at the Voreux. The Belgians have come with\r\nlittle N\xc3\xa9grel."\r\n\r\n"Yes, they landed them at nightfall," muttered Rasseneur, who remained\r\nstanding. "As long as they don\'t kill each other after all!"\r\n\r\nThen raising his voice:\r\n\r\n"No, you know, I don\'t want to begin our disputes over again, but this\r\nwill end badly if you hold out any longer. Why, your story is just like\r\nthat of your International. I met Pluchart the day before yesterday, at\r\nLille, where I went on business. It\'s going wrong, that machine of his."\r\n\r\nHe gave details. The association, after having conquered the workers\r\nof the whole world, in an outburst of propaganda which had left the\r\nmiddle class still shuddering, was now being devoured and slowly\r\ndestroyed by an internal struggle between vanities and ambitions.\r\nSince the anarchists had triumphed in it, chasing out the earlier\r\nevolutionists, everything was breaking up; the original aim, the reform\r\nof the wage-system, was lost in the midst of the squabbling of sects;\r\nthe scientific framework was disorganized by the hatred of discipline.\r\nAnd already it was possible to foresee the final miscarriage of this\r\ngeneral revolt which for a moment had threatened to carry away in a\r\nbreath the old rotten society.\r\n\r\n"Pluchart is ill over it," Rasseneur went on. "And he has no voice at\r\nall now. All the same, he talks on in spite of everything and wants to\r\ngo to Paris. And he told me three times over that our strike was done\r\nfor."\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne with his eyes on the ground let him talk on without\r\ninterruption. The evening before he had chatted with some mates, and he\r\nfelt that breaths of spite and suspicion were passing over him, those\r\nfirst breaths of unpopularity which forerun defeat. And he remained\r\ngloomy, he would not confess dejection in the presence of a man who had\r\nforetold to him that the crowd would hoot him in his turn on the day\r\nwhen they had to avenge themselves for a miscalculation.\r\n\r\n"No doubt the strike is done for, I know that as well as Pluchart," he\r\nsaid. "But we foresaw that. We accepted this strike against our wishes,\r\nwe didn\'t count on finishing up with the Company. Only one gets carried\r\naway, one begins to expect things, and when it turns out badly one\r\nforgets that one ought to have expected that, instead of lamenting and\r\nquarrelling as if it were a catastrophe tumbled down from heaven."\r\n\r\n"Then if you think the game\'s lost," asked Rasseneur, "why don\'t you\r\nmake the mates listen to reason?"\r\n\r\nThe young man looked at him fixedly.\r\n\r\n"Listen! enough of this. You have your ideas, I have mine. I came in\r\nhere to show you that I feel esteem for you in spite of everything.\r\nBut I still think that if we come to grief over this trouble, our\r\nstarved carcasses will do more for the people\'s cause than all your\r\ncommon-sense politics. Ah! if one of those bloody soldiers would just\r\nput a bullet in my heart, that would be a fine way of ending!"\r\n\r\nHis eyes were moist, as in this cry there broke out the secret desire\r\nof the vanquished, the refuge in which he desired to lose his torment\r\nfor ever.\r\n\r\n"Well said!" declared Madame Rasseneur, casting on her husband a look\r\nwhich was full of all the contempt of her radical opinions.\r\n\r\nSouvarine, with a vague gaze, feeling about with his nervous hands, did\r\nnot appear to hear. His fair girlish face, with the thin nose and small\r\npointed teeth, seemed to be growing savage in some mystic dream full\r\nof bloody visions. And he began to dream aloud, replying to a remark\r\nof Rasseneur\'s about the International which had been let fall in the\r\ncourse of the conversation.\r\n\r\n"They are all cowards; there is only one man who can make their machine\r\ninto a terrible instrument of destruction. It requires will, and none\r\nof them have will; and that\'s why the revolution will miscarry once\r\nmore."\r\n\r\nHe went on in a voice of disgust, lamenting the imbecility of men,\r\nwhile the other two were disturbed by these somnambulistic confidences\r\nmade in the darkness. In Russia there was nothing going on well, and\r\nhe was in despair over the news he had received. His old companions\r\nwere all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made\r\nEurope tremble--sons of village priests, of the lower middle class,\r\nof tradesmen--could not rise above the idea of national liberation,\r\nand seemed to believe that the world would be delivered--when they had\r\nkilled their despot. As soon as he spoke to them of razing society\r\nto the ground like a ripe harvest--as soon as he even pronounced the\r\ninfantile word "republic"--he felt that he was misunderstood and a\r\ndisturber, henceforth unclassed, enrolled among the lost leaders of\r\ncosmopolitan revolution. His patriotic heart struggled, however, and it\r\nwas with painful bitterness that he repeated his favourite expression:\r\n\r\n"Foolery! They\'ll never get out of it with their foolery."\r\n\r\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described\r\nhis old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune;\r\nhe had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the\r\nfoundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his\r\npockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been\r\nas tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion,\r\nwinning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of\r\nchattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place; he remained\r\na stranger, with his contempt of all bonds, his desire to keep himself\r\nfree of all petty vanities and enjoyments. And since this morning\r\nhe had been especially exasperated by reading an incident in the\r\nnewspapers.\r\n\r\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \xc3\x89tienne,\r\ndirectly addressing him:\r\n\r\n"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have\r\nwon the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off\r\nat once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without\r\ndoing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you\r\nwant to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in\r\nsome lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against\r\nthe rich, you haven\'t got courage enough to give back to the poor the\r\nmoney that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as\r\nlong as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds\r\nsolely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place."\r\n\r\nRasseneur burst out laughing. The idea that the two Marseilles workmen\r\nought to renounce the big prize seemed to him absurd. But Souvarine\r\ngrew pale; his face changed and became terrible in one of those\r\nreligious rages which exterminate nations. He cried:\r\n\r\n"You will all be mown down, overthrown, cast on the dung-heap.\r\nSomeone will be born who will annihilate your race of cowards and\r\npleasure-seekers. And look here! you see my hands; if my hands were\r\nable they would take up the earth, like that, and shake it until it was\r\nsmashed to fragments, and you were all buried beneath the rubbish."\r\n\r\n"Well said," declared Madame Rasseneur, with her polite and convinced\r\nair.\r\n\r\nThere was silence again. Then \xc3\x89tienne spoke once more of the Borinage\r\nmen. He questioned Souvarine concerning the steps that had been taken\r\nat the Voreux. But the engine-man was still preoccupied, and scarcely\r\nreplied. He only knew that cartridges would be distributed to the\r\nsoldiers who were guarding the pit; and the nervous restlessness of his\r\nfingers over his knees increased to such an extent that, at last, he\r\nbecame conscious of what was lacking--the soft and soothing fur of the\r\ntame rabbit.\r\n\r\n"Where is Poland, then?" he asked.\r\n\r\nThe innkeeper laughed again as he looked at his wife. After an awkward\r\nsilence he made up his mind:\r\n\r\n"Poland? She is in the pot."\r\n\r\nSince her adventure with Jeanlin, the pregnant rabbit, no doubt\r\nwounded, had only brought forth dead young ones; and to avoid feeding a\r\nuseless mouth they had resigned themselves that very day to serve her\r\nup with potatoes.\r\n\r\n"Yes, you ate one of her legs this evening. Eh! You licked your fingers\r\nafter it!"\r\n\r\nSouvarine had not understood at first. Then he became very pale, and\r\nhis face contracted with nausea; while, in spite of his stoicism, two\r\nlarge tears were swelling beneath his eyelids.\r\n\r\nBut no one had time to notice this emotion, for the door had opened\r\nroughly and Chaval had appeared, pushing Catherine before him.\r\nAfter having made himself drunk with beer and bluster in all the\r\npublic-houses of Montsou, the idea had occurred to him to go to the\r\nAvantage to show his old friends that he was not afraid. As he came in,\r\nhe said to his mistress:\r\n\r\n"By God! I tell you you shall drink a glass in here; I\'ll break the\r\njaws of the first man who looks askance at me!"\r\n\r\nCatherine, moved at the sight of \xc3\x89tienne, had become very pale. When\r\nChaval in his turn perceived him, he grinned in his evil fashion.\r\n\r\n"Two glasses, Madame Rasseneur! We\'re wetting the new start of work."\r\n\r\nWithout a word she poured out, as a woman who never refused her beer to\r\nany one. There was silence, and neither the landlord nor the two others\r\nstirred from their places.\r\n\r\n"I know people who\'ve said that I was a spy," Chaval went on\r\nswaggeringly, "and I\'m waiting for them just to say it again to my\r\nface, so that we can have a bit of explanation."\r\n\r\nNo one replied, and the men turned their heads and gazed vaguely at the\r\nwalls.\r\n\r\n"There are some who sham, and there are some who don\'t sham," he went\r\non louder. "I\'ve nothing to hide. I\'ve left Deneulin\'s dirty shop,\r\nand to-morrow I\'m going down to the Voreux with a dozen Belgians, who\r\nhave been given me to lead because I\'m held in esteem; and if any one\r\ndoesn\'t like that, he can just say so, and we\'ll talk it over."\r\n\r\nThen, as the same contemptuous silence greeted his provocations, he\r\nturned furiously on Catherine.\r\n\r\n"Will you drink, by God? Drink with me to the confusion of all the\r\ndirty beasts who refuse to work."\r\n\r\nShe drank, but with so trembling a hand that the two glasses struck\r\ntogether with a tinkling sound. He had now pulled out of his pocket a\r\nhandful of silver, which he exhibited with drunken ostentation, saying\r\nthat he had earned that with his sweat, and that he defied the shammers\r\nto show ten sous. The attitude of his mates exasperated him, and he\r\nbegan to come to direct insults.\r\n\r\n"Then it is at night that the moles come out? The police have to go to\r\nsleep before we meet the brigands."\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne had risen, very calm and resolute.\r\n\r\n"Listen! You annoy me. Yes, you are a spy; your money still stinks of\r\nsome treachery. You\'ve sold yourself, and it disgusts me to touch your\r\nskin. No matter; I\'m your man. It is quite time that one of us did for\r\nthe other."\r\n\r\nChaval clenched his fists.\r\n\r\n"Come along, then, cowardly dog! I must call you so to warm you up.\r\nYou all alone--I\'m quite willing; and you shall pay for all the bloody\r\ntricks that have been played on me."\r\n\r\nWith suppliant arms Catherine advanced between them. But they had no\r\nneed to repel her; she felt the necessity of the battle, and slowly\r\ndrew back of her own accord. Standing against the wall, she remained\r\nsilent, so paralysed with anguish that she no longer shivered, her\r\nlarge eyes gazing at these two men who were going to kill each other\r\nover her.\r\n\r\nMadame Rasseneur simply removed the glasses from the counter for fear\r\nthat they might be broken. Then she sat down again on the bench,\r\nwithout showing any improper curiosity. But two old mates could\r\nnot be left to murder each other like this. Rasseneur persisted in\r\ninterfering, and Souvarine had to take him by the shoulder and lead him\r\nback to the table, saying:\r\n\r\n"It doesn\'t concern you. There is one of them too many, and the\r\nstrongest must live."\r\n\r\nWithout waiting for the attack, Chaval\'s fists were already dealing\r\nblows at space. He was the taller of the two, and his blows swung about\r\naiming at the face, with furious cutting movements of both arms one\r\nafter the other, as though he were handling a couple of sabres. And he\r\nwent on talking, playing to the gallery with volleys of abuse, which\r\nserved to excite him.\r\n\r\n"Ah! you damned devil, I\'ll have your nose! I\'ll do for your bloody\r\nnose! Just let me get at your chops, you whore\'s looking-glass;\r\nI\'ll make a hash for the bloody swine, and then we shall see if the\r\nstrumpets will run after you!"\r\n\r\nIn silence, and with clenched teeth, \xc3\x89tienne gathered up his small\r\nfigure, according to the rules of the game, protecting his chest and\r\nface by both fists; and he watched and let them fly like springs\r\nreleased, with terrible straight blows.\r\n\r\nAt first they did each other little damage. The whirling and blustering\r\nblows of the one, the cool watchfulness of the other, prolonged the\r\nstruggle. A chair was overthrown; their heavy boots crushed the white\r\nsand scattered on the floor. But at last they were out of breath, their\r\npanting respiration was heard, while their faces became red and swollen\r\nas from an interior fire which flamed out from the clear holes of their\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n"Played!" yelled Chaval; "trumps on your carcass!"\r\n\r\nIn fact his fist, working like a flail, had struck his adversary\'s\r\nshoulder. \xc3\x89tienne restrained a groan of pain and the only sound that\r\nwas heard was the dull bruising of the muscles. \xc3\x89tienne replied with\r\na straight blow to Chaval\'s chest, which would have knocked him out,\r\nhad he had not saved himself by one of his constant goat-like leaps.\r\nThe blow, however, caught him on the left flank with such effect that\r\nhe tottered, momentarily winded. He became furious on feeling his arm\r\ngrow limp with pain, and kicked out like a wild beast, aiming at his\r\nadversary\'s belly with his heel.\r\n\r\n"Have at your guts!" he stammered in a choked voice. "I\'ll pull them\r\nout and unwind them for you!"\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne avoided the blow, so indignant at this infraction of the laws\r\nof fair fighting that he broke silence.\r\n\r\n"Hold your tongue, brute! And no feet, by God! or I take a chair and\r\nbash you with it!"\r\n\r\nThen the struggle became serious. Rasseneur was disgusted, and would\r\nagain have interfered, but a severe look from his wife held him back:\r\nhad not two customers a right to settle an affair in the house?\r\nHe simply placed himself before the fireplace, for fear lest they\r\nshould tumble over into it. Souvarine, in his quiet way, had rolled a\r\ncigarette, but he forgot to light it. Catherine was motionless against\r\nthe wall; only her hands had unconsciously risen to her waist, and with\r\nconstant fidgeting movements were twisting and tearing at the stuff of\r\nher dress. She was striving as hard as possible not to cry out, and so,\r\nperhaps, kill one of them by declaring her preference; but she was,\r\ntoo, so distracted that she did not even know which she preferred.\r\n\r\nChaval, who was bathed in sweat and striking at random, soon became\r\nexhausted. In spite of his anger, \xc3\x89tienne continued to cover himself,\r\nparrying nearly all the blows, a few of which grazed him. His ear was\r\nsplit, a finger nail had torn away a piece of his neck, and this so\r\nsmarted that he swore in his turn as he drove out one of his terrible\r\nstraight blows. Once more Chaval saved his chest by a leap, but he had\r\nlowered himself, and the fist reached his face, smashing his nose and\r\ncrushing one eye. Immediately a jet of blood came from his nostrils,\r\nand his eye became swollen and bluish. Blinded by this red flood, and\r\ndazed by the shock to his skull, the wretch was beating the air with\r\nhis arms at random, when another blow, striking him at last full in the\r\nchest, finished him. There was a crunching sound; he fell on his back\r\nwith a heavy thud, as when a sack of plaster is emptied.\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne waited.\r\n\r\n"Get up! if you want some more, we\'ll begin again."\r\n\r\nWithout replying, Chaval, after a few minutes\' stupefaction, moved\r\non the ground and stretched his limbs. He picked himself up with\r\ndifficulty, resting for a moment curled up on his knees, doing\r\nsomething with his hand in the bottom of his pocket which could not be\r\nobserved. Then, when he was up, he rushed forward again, his throat\r\nswelling with a savage yell.\r\n\r\nBut Catherine had seen; and in spite of herself a loud cry came from\r\nher heart, astonishing her like the avowal of a preference she had\r\nherself been ignorant of:\r\n\r\n"Take care! he\'s got his knife!"\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne had only time to parry the first blow with his arm. His woollen\r\njacket was cut by the thick blade, one of those blades fastened by a\r\ncopper ferrule into a boxwood handle. He had already seized Chaval\'s\r\nwrist, and a terrible struggle began; for he felt that he would be lost\r\nif he let go, while the other shook his arm in the effort to free it\r\nand strike. The weapon was gradually lowered as their stiffened limbs\r\ngrew fatigued. \xc3\x89tienne twice felt the cold sensation of the steel\r\nagainst his skin; and he had to make a supreme effort, so crushing the\r\nother\'s wrist that the knife slipped from his hand. Both of them had\r\nfallen to the earth, and it was \xc3\x89tienne who snatched it up, brandishing\r\nit in his turn. He held Chaval down beneath his knee and threatened to\r\nslit his throat open.\r\n\r\n"Ah, traitor! by God! you\'ve got it coming to you now!"\r\n\r\nHe felt an awful voice within, deafening him. It arose from his bowels\r\nand was beating in his head like a hammer, a sudden mania of murder, a\r\nneed to taste blood. Never before had the crisis so shaken him. He was\r\nnot drunk, however, and he struggled against the hereditary disease\r\nwith the despairing shudder of a man who is mad with lust and struggles\r\non the verge of rape. At last he conquered himself; he threw the knife\r\nbehind him, stammering in a hoarse voice:\r\n\r\n"Get up--off you go!"\r\n\r\nThis time Rasseneur had rushed forward, but without quite daring to\r\nventure between them, for fear of catching a nasty blow. He did not\r\nwant any one to be murdered in his house, and was so angry that his\r\nwife, sitting erect at the counter, remarked to him that he always\r\ncried out too soon. Souvarine, who had nearly caught the knife in his\r\nlegs, decided to light his cigarette. Was it, then, all over? Catherine\r\nwas looking on stupidly at the two men, who were unexpectedly both\r\nliving.\r\n\r\n"Off you go!" repeated \xc3\x89tienne. "Off you go, or I\'ll do for you!"\r\n\r\nChaval arose, and with the back of his hand wiped away the blood which\r\ncontinued to flow from his nose; with jaw smeared red and bruised\r\neye, he went away trailing his feet, furious at his defeat. Catherine\r\nmechanically followed him. Then he turned round, and his hatred broke\r\nout in a flood of filth.\r\n\r\n"No, no! since you want him, sleep with him, dirty jade! and don\'t put\r\nyour bloody feet in my place again if you value your skin!"\r\n\r\nHe violently banged the door. There was deep silence in the warm room,\r\nthe low crackling of the coal was alone heard. On the ground there only\r\nremained the overturned chair and a rain of blood which the sand on the\r\nfloor was drinking up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen they came out of Rasseneur\'s, \xc3\x89tienne and Catherine walked on in\r\nsilence. The thaw was beginning, a slow cold thaw which stained the\r\nsnow without melting it. In the livid sky a full moon could be faintly\r\nseen behind great clouds, black rags driven furiously by a tempestuous\r\nwind far above; and on the earth no breath was stirring, nothing could\r\nbe heard but drippings from the roofs, the falling of white lumps with\r\na soft thud.\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne was embarrassed by this woman who had been given to him, and\r\nin his disquiet he could find nothing to say. The idea of taking her\r\nwith him to hide at R\xc3\xa9quillart seemed absurd. He had proposed to lead\r\nher back to the settlement, to her parents\' house, but she had refused\r\nin terror. No, no! anything rather than be a burden on them once more\r\nafter having behaved so badly to them! And neither of them spoke any\r\nmore; they tramped on at random through the roads which were becoming\r\nrivers of mud. At first they went down towards the Voreux; then they\r\nturned to the right and passed between the pit-bank and the canal.\r\n\r\n"But you\'ll have to sleep somewhere," he said at last. "Now, if I only\r\nhad a room, I could easily take you----"\r\n\r\nBut a curious spasm of timidity interrupted him. The past came back\r\nto him, their old longings for each other, and the delicacies and the\r\nshames which had prevented them from coming together. Did he still\r\ndesire her, that he felt so troubled, gradually warmed at the heart by\r\na fresh longing? The recollection of the blows she had dealt him at\r\nGaston-Marie now attracted him instead of filling him with spite. And\r\nhe was surprised; the idea of taking her to R\xc3\xa9quillart was becoming\r\nquite natural and easy to execute.\r\n\r\n"Now, come, decide; where would you like me to take you? You must hate\r\nme very much to refuse to come with me!"\r\n\r\nShe was following him slowly, delayed by the painful slipping of her\r\nsabots into the ruts; and without raising her head she murmured:\r\n\r\n"I have enough trouble, good God! don\'t give me any more. What good\r\nwould it do us, what you ask, now that I have a lover and you have a\r\nwoman yourself?"\r\n\r\nShe meant Mouquette. She believed that he still went with this girl, as\r\nthe rumour ran for the last fortnight; and when he swore to her that it\r\nwas not so she shook her head, for she remembered the evening when she\r\nhad seen them eagerly kissing each other.\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t it a pity, all this nonsense?" he whispered, stopping. "We might\r\nunderstand each other so well."\r\n\r\nShe shuddered slightly and replied:\r\n\r\n"Never mind, you\'ve nothing to be sorry for; you don\'t lose much. If\r\nyou knew what a trumpery thing I am--no bigger than two ha\'porth of\r\nbutter, so ill made that I shall never become a woman, sure enough!"\r\n\r\nAnd she went on freely accusing herself, as though the long delay of\r\nher puberty had been her own fault. In spite of the man whom she had\r\nhad, this lessened her, placed her among the urchins. One has some\r\nexcuse, at any rate, when one can produce a child.\r\n\r\n"My poor little one!" said \xc3\x89tienne, with deep pity, in a very low voice.\r\n\r\nThey were at the foot of the pit-bank, hidden in the shadow of the\r\nenormous pile. An inky cloud was just then passing over the moon;\r\nthey could no longer even distinguish their faces, their breaths\r\nwere mingled, their lips were seeking each other for that kiss which\r\nhad tormented them with desire for months. But suddenly the moon\r\nreappeared, and they saw the sentinel above them, at the top of the\r\nrocks white with light, standing out erect on the Voreux. And before\r\nthey had kissed an emotion of modesty separated them, that old modesty\r\nin which there was something of anger, a vague repugnance, and much\r\nfriendship. They set out again heavily, up to their ankles in mud.\r\n\r\n"Then it\'s settled. You don\'t want to have anything to do with me?"\r\nasked \xc3\x89tienne.\r\n\r\n"No," she said. "You after Chaval; and after you another, eh? No, that\r\ndisgusts me; it doesn\'t give me any pleasure. What\'s the use of doing\r\nit?"\r\n\r\nThey were silent, and walked some hundred paces without exchanging a\r\nword.\r\n\r\n"But, anyhow, do you know where to go to?" he said again. "I can\'t\r\nleave you out in a night like this."\r\n\r\nShe replied, simply:\r\n\r\n"I\'m going back. Chaval is my man. I have nowhere else to sleep but\r\nwith him."\r\n\r\n"But he will beat you to death."\r\n\r\nThere was silence again. She had shrugged her shoulders in resignation.\r\nHe would beat her, and when he was tired of beating her he would stop.\r\nWas not that better than to roam the streets like a vagabond? Then she\r\nwas used to blows; she said, to console herself, that eight out of ten\r\ngirls were no better off than she was. If her lover married her some\r\nday it would, all the same, be very nice of him.\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne and Catherine were moving mechanically towards Montsou, and\r\nas they came nearer their silences grew longer. It was as though they\r\nhad never before been together. He could find no argument to convince\r\nher, in spite of the deep vexation which he felt at seeing her go back\r\nto Chaval. His heart was breaking, he had nothing better to offer than\r\nan existence of wretchedness and flight, a night with no to-morrow\r\nshould a soldier\'s bullet go through his head. Perhaps, after all, it\r\nwas wiser to suffer what he was suffering rather than risk a fresh\r\nsuffering. So he led her back to her lover\'s, with sunken head, and\r\nmade no protest when she stopped him on the main road, at the corner of\r\nthe Yards, twenty metres from the Estaminet Piquette, saying:\r\n\r\n"Don\'t come any farther. If he sees you it will only make things worse."\r\n\r\nEleven o\'clock struck at the church. The estaminet was closed, but\r\ngleams came through the cracks.\r\n\r\n"Good-bye," she murmured.\r\n\r\nShe had given him her hand; he kept it, and she had to draw it away\r\npainfully, with a slow effort, to leave him. Without turning her head,\r\nshe went in through the little latched door. But he did not turn away,\r\nstanding at the same place with his eyes on the house, anxious as to\r\nwhat was passing within. He listened, trembling lest he should hear the\r\ncries of a beaten woman. The house remained black and silent; he only\r\nsaw a light appear at a first-floor window, and as this window opened,\r\nand he recognized the thin shadow that was leaning over the road, he\r\ncame near.\r\n\r\nCatherine then whispered very low:\r\n\r\n"He\'s not come back. I\'m going to bed. Please go away."\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne went off. The thaw was increasing; a regular shower was falling\r\nfrom the roofs, a moist sweat flowed down the walls, the palings, the\r\nwhole confused mass of this industrial district lost in night. At\r\nfirst he turned towards R\xc3\xa9quillart, sick with fatigue and sadness,\r\nhaving no other desire except to disappear under the earth and to be\r\nannihilated there. Then the idea of the Voreux occurred to him again.\r\nHe thought of the Belgian workmen who were going down, of his mates at\r\nthe settlement, exasperated against the soldiers and resolved not to\r\ntolerate strangers in their pit. And he passed again along the canal\r\nthrough the puddles of melted snow.\r\n\r\nAs he stood once more near the pit-bank the moon was shining brightly.\r\nHe raised his eyes and gazed at the sky. The clouds were galloping by,\r\nwhipped on by the strong wind which was blowing up there; but they were\r\ngrowing white, and ravelling out thinly with the misty transparency\r\nof troubled water over the moon\'s face. They succeeded each other so\r\nrapidly that the moon, veiled at moments, constantly reappeared in\r\nlimpid clearness.\r\n\r\nWith gaze full of this pure brightness, \xc3\x89tienne was lowering his head,\r\nwhen a spectacle on the summit of the pit-bank attracted his attention.\r\nThe sentinel, stiffened by cold, was walking up and down, taking\r\ntwenty-five paces towards Marchiennes, and then returning towards\r\nMontsou. The white glitter of his bayonet could be seen above his black\r\nsilhouette, which stood out clearly against the pale sky. But what\r\ninterested the young man, behind the cabin where Bonnemort used to take\r\nshelter on tempestuous nights, was a moving shadow--a crouching beast\r\nin ambush--which he immediately recognized as Jeanlin, with his long\r\nflexible spine like a marten\'s. The sentinel could not see him. That\r\nbrigand of a child was certainly preparing some practical joke, for he\r\nwas still furious against the soldiers, and asking when they were going\r\nto be freed from these murderers who had been sent here with guns to\r\nkill people.\r\n\r\nFor a moment \xc3\x89tienne thought of calling him to prevent the execution of\r\nsome stupid trick. The moon was hidden. He had seen him draw himself\r\nup ready to spring; but the moon reappeared, and the child remained\r\ncrouching. At every turn the sentinel came as far as the cabin, then\r\nturned his back and walked in the opposite direction. And suddenly, as\r\na cloud threw its shadow, Jeanlin leapt on to the soldier\'s shoulders\r\nwith the great bound of a wild cat, and gripping him with his claws\r\nburied his large open knife in his throat. The horse-hair collar\r\nresisted; he had to apply both hands to the handle and hang on with\r\nall the weight of his body. He had often bled fowls which he had found\r\nbehind farms. It was so rapid that there was only a stifled cry in the\r\nnight, while the musket fell with the sound of old iron. Already the\r\nmoon was shining again.\r\n\r\nMotionless with stupor, \xc3\x89tienne was still gazing. A shout had been\r\nchoked in his chest. Above, the pit-bank was vacant; no shadow was\r\nany longer visible against the wild flight of clouds. He ran up and\r\nfound Jeanlin on all fours before the corpse, which was lying back\r\nwith extended arms. Beneath the limpid light the red trousers and grey\r\novercoat contrasted harshly with the snow. Not a drop of blood had\r\nflowed, the knife was still in the throat up to the handle. With a\r\nfurious, unreasoning blow of the fist he knocked the child down beside\r\nthe body.\r\n\r\n"What have you done that for?" he stammered wildly.\r\n\r\nJeanlin picked himself up and rested on his hands, with a feline\r\nmovement of his thin spine; his large ears, his green eyes, his\r\nprominent jaws were quivering and aflame with the shock of his deadly\r\nblow.\r\n\r\n"By God! why have you done this?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know; I wanted to."\r\n\r\nHe persisted in this reply. For three days he had wanted to. It\r\ntormented him, it made his head ache behind his ears, because he\r\nthought about it so much. Need one be so particular with these damned\r\nsoldiers who were worrying the colliers in their own homes? Of the\r\nviolent speeches he had heard in the forest, the cries of destruction\r\nand death shouted among the pits, five or six words had remained with\r\nhim, and these he repeated like a street urchin playing at revolution.\r\nAnd he knew no more; no one had urged him on, it had come to him of\r\nitself, just as the desire to steal onions from a field came to him.\r\n\r\nStartled at this obscure growth of crime in the recesses of this\r\nchildish brain, \xc3\x89tienne again pushed him away with a kick, like an\r\nunconscious animal. He trembled lest the guard at the Voreux had heard\r\nthe sentinel\'s stifled cry, and looked towards the pit every time the\r\nmoon was uncovered. But nothing stirred, and he bent down, felt the\r\nhands that were gradually becoming icy, and listened to the heart,\r\nwhich had stopped beneath the overcoat. Only the bone handle of the\r\nknife could be seen with the motto on it, the simple word "Amour,"\r\nengraved in black letters.\r\n\r\nHis eyes went from the throat to the face. Suddenly he recognized the\r\nlittle soldier; it was Jules, the recruit with whom he had talked one\r\nmorning. And deep pity came over him in front of this fair gentle face,\r\nmarked with freckles. The blue eyes, wide open, were gazing at the sky\r\nwith that fixed gaze with which he had before seen him searching the\r\nhorizon for the country of his birth. Where was it, that Plogof which\r\nhad appeared to him beneath the dazzling sun? Over there, over there!\r\nThe sea was moaning afar on this tempestuous night. That wind passing\r\nabove had perhaps swept over the moors. Two women perhaps were standing\r\nthere, the mother and the sister, clutching their wind-blown coifs,\r\ngazing as if they could see what was now happening to the little fellow\r\nthrough the leagues which separated them. They would always wait for\r\nhim now. What an abominable thing it is for poor devils to kill each\r\nother for the sake of the rich!\r\n\r\nBut this corpse had to be disposed of. \xc3\x89tienne at first thought of\r\nthrowing it into the canal, but was deterred from this by the certainty\r\nthat it would be found there. His anxiety became extreme, every minute\r\nwas of importance; what decision should he take? He had a sudden\r\ninspiration: if he could carry the body as far as R\xc3\xa9quillart, he would\r\nbe able to bury it there for ever.\r\n\r\n"Come here," he said to Jeanlin.\r\n\r\nThe child was suspicious.\r\n\r\n"No, you want to beat me. And then I have business. Good night."\r\n\r\nIn fact, he had given a rendezvous to B\xc3\xa9bert and Lydie in a\r\nhiding-place, a hole arranged under the wood supply at the Voreux. It\r\nhad been arranged to sleep out, so as to be there if the Belgians\'\r\nbones were to be broken by stoning when they went down the pit.\r\n\r\n"Listen!" repeated \xc3\x89tienne. "Come here, or I shall call the soldiers,\r\nwho will cut your head off."\r\n\r\nAnd as Jeanlin was making up his mind, he rolled his handkerchief, and\r\nbound the soldier\'s neck tightly, without drawing out the knife, so as\r\nto prevent the blood from flowing. The snow was melting; on the soil\r\nthere was neither a red patch nor the footmarks of a struggle.\r\n\r\n"Take the legs!"\r\n\r\nJeanlin took the legs, while \xc3\x89tienne seized the shoulders, after having\r\nfastened the gun behind his back, and then they both slowly descended\r\nthe pit-bank, trying to avoid rolling any rocks down. Fortunately the\r\nmoon was hidden. But as they passed along the canal it reappeared\r\nbrightly, and it was a miracle that the guard did not see them.\r\nSilently they hastened on, hindered by the swinging of the corpse, and\r\nobliged to place it on the ground every hundred metres. At the corner\r\nof the R\xc3\xa9quillart lane they heard a sound which froze them with terror,\r\nand they only had time to hide behind a wall to avoid a patrol. Farther\r\non, a man came across them, but he was drunk, and moved away abusing\r\nthem. At last they reached the old pit, bathed in perspiration, and so\r\nexhausted that their teeth were chattering.\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne had guessed that it would not be easy to get the soldier down\r\nthe ladder shaft. It was an awful task. First of all Jeanlin, standing\r\nabove, had to let the body slide down, while \xc3\x89tienne, hanging on to\r\nthe bushes, had to accompany it to enable it to pass the first two\r\nladders where the rungs were broken. Afterwards, at every ladder, he\r\nhad to perform the same manoeuvre over again, going down first, then\r\nreceiving the body in his arms; and he had thus, down thirty ladders,\r\ntwo hundred and ten metres, to feel it constantly falling over him.\r\nThe gun scraped his spine; he had not allowed the child to go for the\r\ncandle-end, which he preserved avariciously. What was the use? The\r\nlight would only embarrass them in this narrow tube. When they arrived\r\nat the pit-eye, however, out of breath, he sent the youngster for the\r\ncandle. He then sat down and waited for him in the darkness, near the\r\nbody, with heart beating violently. As soon as Jeanlin reappeared with\r\nthe light, \xc3\x89tienne consulted with him, for the child had explored these\r\nold workings, even to the cracks through which men could not pass.\r\nThey set out again, dragging the dead body for nearly a kilometre,\r\nthrough a maze of ruinous galleries. At last the roof became low,\r\nand they found themselves kneeling beneath a sandy rock supported by\r\nhalf-broken planks. It was a sort of long chest in which they laid the\r\nlittle soldier as in a coffin; they placed his gun by his side; then\r\nwith vigorous blows of their heels they broke the timber at the risk\r\nof being buried themselves. Immediately the rock gave way, and they\r\nscarcely had time to crawl back on their elbows and knees. When \xc3\x89tienne\r\nreturned, seized by the desire to look once more, the roof was still\r\nfalling in, slowly crushing the body beneath its enormous weight. And\r\nthen there was nothing more left, nothing but the vast mass of the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nJeanlin, having returned to his own corner, his little cavern of\r\nvillainy, was stretching himself out on the hay, overcome by weariness,\r\nand murmuring:\r\n\r\n"Heigho! the brats must wait for me; I\'m going to have an hour\'s sleep."\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne had blown out the candle, of which there was only a small end\r\nleft. He also was worn out, but he was not sleepy; painful nightmare\r\nthoughts were beating like hammers in his skull. Only one at last\r\nremained, torturing him and fatiguing him with a question to which he\r\ncould not reply: Why had he not struck Chaval when he held him beneath\r\nthe knife? and why had this child just killed a soldier whose very\r\nname he did not know? It shook his revolutionary beliefs, the courage\r\nto kill, the right to kill. Was he, then, a coward? In the hay the\r\nchild had begun snoring, the snoring of a drunken man, as if he were\r\nsleeping off the intoxication of his murder. \xc3\x89tienne was disgusted and\r\nirritated; it hurt him to know that the boy was there and to hear him.\r\nSuddenly he started, a breath of fear passed over his face. A light\r\nrustling, a sob, seemed to him to have come out of the depths of the\r\nearth. The image of the little soldier, lying over there with his gun\r\nbeneath the rocks, froze his back and made his hair stand up. It was\r\nidiotic, the whole mine seemed to be filled with voices; he had to\r\nlight the candle again, and only grew calm on seeing the emptiness of\r\nthe galleries by this pale light.\r\n\r\nFor another quarter of an hour he reflected, still absorbed in the\r\nsame struggle, his eyes fixed on the burning wick. But there was a\r\nspluttering, the wick was going out, and everything fell back into\r\ndarkness. He shuddered again; he could have boxed Jeanlin\'s ears, to\r\nkeep him from snoring so loudly. The neighbourhood of the child became\r\nso unbearable that he escaped, tormented by the need for fresh air,\r\nhastening through the galleries and up the passage, as though he could\r\nhear a shadow, panting, at his heels.\r\n\r\nUp above, in the midst of the ruins of R\xc3\xa9quillart, \xc3\x89tienne was at last\r\nable to breathe freely. Since he dared not kill, it was for him to die;\r\nand this idea of death, which had already touched him, came again and\r\nfixed itself in his head, as a last hope. To die bravely, to die for\r\nthe revolution, that would end everything, would settle his account,\r\ngood or bad, and prevent him from thinking more. If the men attacked\r\nthe Borains, he would be in the first rank, and would have a good\r\nchance of getting a bad blow. It was with firmer step that he returned\r\nto prowl around the Voreux. Two o\'clock struck, and the loud noise\r\nof voices was coming from the captains\' room, where the guards who\r\nwatched over the pit were posted. The disappearance of the sentinel had\r\novercome the guards with surprise; they had gone to arouse the captain,\r\nand after a careful examination of the place, they concluded that it\r\nmust be a case of desertion. Hiding in the shade, \xc3\x89tienne recollected\r\nthis republican captain of whom the little soldier had spoken. Who\r\nknows if he might not be persuaded to pass over to the people\'s side!\r\nThe troop would raise their rifles, and that would be the signal for\r\na massacre of the bourgeois. A new dream took possession of him; he\r\nthought no more of dying, but remained for hours with his feet in the\r\nmud, and a drizzle from the thaw falling on his shoulders, filled by\r\nthe feverish hope that victory was still possible.\r\n\r\nUp to five o\'clock he watched for the Borains. Then he perceived\r\nthat the Company had cunningly arranged that they should sleep at\r\nthe Voreux. The descent had begun, and the few strikers from the\r\nDeux-Cent-Quarante settlement who had been posted as scouts had not yet\r\nwarned their mates. It was he who told them of the trick, and they set\r\nout running, while he waited behind the pit-bank, on the towing-path.\r\nSix o\'clock struck, and the earthy sky was growing pale and lighting up\r\nwith a reddish dawn, when the Abb\xc3\xa9 Ranvier came along a path, holding\r\nup his cassock above his thin legs. Every Monday he went to say an\r\nearly mass at a convent chapel on the other side of the pit.\r\n\r\n"Good morning, my friend," he shouted in a loud voice, after staring at\r\nthe young man with his flaming eyes.\r\n\r\nBut \xc3\x89tienne did not reply. Far away between the Voreux platforms he had\r\njust seen a woman pass, and he rushed forward anxiously, for he thought\r\nhe recognized Catherine. Since midnight, Catherine had been walking\r\nabout the thawing roads. Chaval, on coming back and finding her in bed,\r\nhad knocked her out with a blow. He shouted to her to go at once by the\r\ndoor if she did not wish to go by the window; and scarcely dressed,\r\nin tears, and bruised by kicks in her legs, she had been obliged to\r\ngo down, pushed outside by a final thrust. This sudden separation\r\ndazed her, and she sat down on a stone, looking up at the house, still\r\nexpecting that he would call her back. It was not possible; he would\r\nsurely look for her and tell her to come back when he saw her thus\r\nshivering and abandoned, with no one to take her in.\r\n\r\nAt the end of two hours she made up her mind, dying of cold and as\r\nmotionless as a dog thrown into the street. She left Montsou, then\r\nretraced her steps, but dared neither to call from the pathway nor to\r\nknock at the door. At last she went off by the main road to the right\r\nwith the idea of going to the settlement, to her parents\' house. But\r\nwhen she reached it she was seized by such shame that she rushed away\r\nalong the gardens for fear of being recognized by someone, in spite of\r\nthe heavy sleep which weighed on all eyes behind the closed shutters.\r\nAnd after that she wandered about, frightened at the slightest noise,\r\ntrembling lest she should be seized and led away as a strumpet to\r\nthat house at Marchiennes, the threat of which had haunted her like\r\nnightmare for months. Twice she stumbled against the Voreux, but\r\nterrified at the loud voices of the guard, she ran away out of breath,\r\nlooking behind her to see if she was being pursued. The R\xc3\xa9quillart lane\r\nwas always full of drunken men; she went back to it, however, with the\r\nvague hope of meeting there him she had repelled a few hours earlier.\r\n\r\nChaval had to go down that morning, and this thought brought Catherine\r\nagain towards the pit, though she felt that it would be useless to\r\nspeak to him: all was over between them. There was no work going on\r\nat Jean-Bart, and he had sworn to kill her if she worked again at the\r\nVoreux, where he feared that she would compromise him. So what was to\r\nbe done?--to go elsewhere, to die of hunger, to yield beneath the blows\r\nof every man who might pass? She dragged herself along, tottering amid\r\nthe ruts, with aching legs and mud up to her spine. The thaw had now\r\nfilled the streets with a flood of mire. She waded through it, still\r\nwalking, not daring to look for a stone to sit on.\r\n\r\nDay appeared. Catherine had just recognized the back of Chaval, who was\r\ncautiously going round the pit-bank, when she noticed Lydie and B\xc3\xa9bert\r\nputting their noses out of their hiding-place beneath the wood supply.\r\nThey had passed the night there in ambush, without going home, since\r\nJeanlin\'s order was to await him; and while this latter was sleeping\r\noff the drunkenness of his murder at R\xc3\xa9quillart, the two children were\r\nlying in each other\'s arms to keep warm. The wind blew between the\r\nplanks of chestnut and oak, and they rolled themselves up as in some\r\nwood-cutter\'s abandoned hut. Lydie did not dare to speak aloud the\r\nsufferings of a small beaten woman, any more than B\xc3\xa9bert found courage\r\nto complain of the captain\'s blows which made his cheeks swell; but\r\nthe captain was really abusing his power, risking their bones in mad\r\nmarauding expeditions while refusing to share the booty. Their hearts\r\nrose in revolt, and they had at last embraced each other in spite of\r\nhis orders, careless of that box of the ears from the invisible with\r\nwhich he had threatened them. It never came, so they went on kissing\r\neach other softly, with no idea of anything else, putting into that\r\ncaress the passion they had long struggled against--the whole of their\r\nmartyred and tender natures. All night through they had thus kept each\r\nother warm, so happy, at the bottom of this secret hole, that they\r\ncould not remember that they had ever been so happy before--not even on\r\nSt. Barbara\'s day, when they had eaten fritters and drunk wine.\r\n\r\nThe sudden sound of a bugle made Catherine start. She raised herself,\r\nand saw the Voreux guards taking up their arms. \xc3\x89tienne arrived\r\nrunning; B\xc3\xa9bert and Lydie jumped out of their hiding-place with a leap.\r\nAnd over there, beneath the growing daylight, a band of men and women\r\nwere coming from the settlement, gesticulating wildly with anger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the entrances to the Voreux had been closed, and the sixty\r\nsoldiers, with grounded arms, were barring the only door left free,\r\nthat leading to the receiving-room by a narrow staircase into which\r\nopened the captains\' room and the shed. The men had been drawn up in\r\ntwo lines against the brick wall, so that they could not be attacked\r\nfrom behind.\r\n\r\nAt first the band of miners from the settlement kept at a distance.\r\nThey were some thirty at most, and talked together in a violent and\r\nconfused way.\r\n\r\nMaheude, who had arrived first with dishevelled hair beneath a\r\nhandkerchief knotted on in haste, and having Estelle asleep in her\r\narms, repeated in feverish tones:\r\n\r\n"Don\'t let any one in or any one out! Shut them all in there!"\r\n\r\nMaheu approved, and just then Father Mouque arrived from R\xc3\xa9quillart.\r\nThey wanted to prevent him from passing. But he protested; he said that\r\nhis horses ate their hay all the same, and cared precious little about\r\na revolution. Besides, there was a horse dead, and they were waiting\r\nfor him to draw it up. \xc3\x89tienne freed the old groom, and the soldiers\r\nallowed him to go to the shaft. A quarter of an hour later, as the band\r\nof strikers, which had gradually enlarged, was becoming threatening,\r\na large door opened on the ground floor and some men appeared drawing\r\nout the dead beast, a miserable mass of flesh still fastened in the\r\nrope net; they left it in the midst of the puddles of melting snow. The\r\nsurprise was so great that no one prevented the men from returning and\r\nbarricading the door afresh. They all recognized the horse, with his\r\nhead bent back and stiff against the plank. Whispers ran around:\r\n\r\n"It\'s Trompette, isn\'t it? it\'s Trompette."\r\n\r\nIt was, in fact, Trompette. Since his descent he had never become\r\nacclimatized. He remained melancholy, with no taste for his task, as\r\nthough tortured by regret for the light. In vain Bataille, the _doyen_\r\nof the mine, would rub him with his ribs in his friendly way,\r\nsoftly biting his neck to impart to him a little of the resignation\r\ngained in his ten years beneath the earth. These caresses increased his\r\nmelancholy, his skin quivered beneath the confidences of the comrade\r\nwho had grown old in darkness; and both of them, whenever they met and\r\nsnorted together, seemed to be grieving, the old one that he could no\r\nlonger remember, the young one that he could not forget. At the stable\r\nthey were neighbours at the manger, and lived with lowered heads,\r\nbreathing in each other\'s nostrils, exchanging a constant dream of\r\ndaylight, visions of green grass, of white roads, of infinite yellow\r\nlight. Then, when Trompette, bathed in sweat, lay in agony in his\r\nlitter, Bataille had smelled at him despairingly with short sniffs like\r\nsobs. He felt that he was growing cold, the mine was taking from him\r\nhis last joy, that friend fallen from above, fresh with good odours,\r\nwho recalled to him his youth in the open air. And he had broken his\r\ntether, neighing with fear, when he perceived that the other no longer\r\nstirred.\r\n\r\nMouque had indeed warned the head captain a week ago. But much they\r\ntroubled about a sick horse at such time as this! These gentlemen did\r\nnot at all like moving the horses. Now, however, they had to make up\r\ntheir minds to take him out. The evening before the groom had spent\r\nan hour with two men tying up Trompette. They harnessed Bataille to\r\nbring him to the shaft. The old horse slowly pulled, dragging his dead\r\ncomrade through so narrow a gallery that he could only shake himself at\r\nthe risk of taking the skin off. And he tossed his head, listening to\r\nthe grazing sound of the carcass as it went to the knacker\'s yard. At\r\nthe pit-eye, when he was unharnessed, he followed with his melancholy\r\neye the preparations for the ascent--the body pushed on to the\r\ncross-bars over the sump, the net fastened beneath a cage. At last the\r\nporters rang meat; he lifted his neck to see it go up, at first softly,\r\nthen at once lost in the darkness, flown up for ever to the top of that\r\nblack hole. And he remained with neck stretched out, his vague beast\'s\r\nmemory perhaps recalling the things of the earth. But it was all over;\r\nhe would never see his comrade again, and he himself would thus be\r\ntied up in a pitiful bundle on the day when he would ascend up there.\r\nHis legs began to tremble, the fresh air which came from the distant\r\ncountry choked him, and he seemed intoxicated when he went heavily back\r\nto the stable.\r\n\r\nAt the surface the colliers stood gloomily before Trompette\'s carcass.\r\nA woman said in a low voice:\r\n\r\n"Another man; that may go down if it likes!"\r\n\r\nBut a new flood arrived from the settlement, and Levaque, who was at\r\nthe head followed by his wife and Bouteloup, shouted:\r\n\r\n"Kill them, those Borains! No blacklegs here! Kill them! Kill them!"\r\n\r\nAll rushed forward, and \xc3\x89tienne had to stop them. He went up to the\r\ncaptain, a tall thin young man of scarcely twenty-eight years, with\r\na despairing, resolute face. He explained things to him; he tried to\r\nwin him over, watching the effect of his words. What was the good of\r\nrisking a useless massacre? Was not justice on the side of the miners?\r\nThey were all brothers, and they ought to understand one another.\r\nWhen he came to use the world "republic" the captain made a nervous\r\nmovement; but he preserved his military stiffness, and said suddenly:\r\n\r\n"Keep off! Do not force me to do my duty."\r\n\r\nThree times over \xc3\x89tienne tried again. Behind him his mates were\r\ngrowling. The report ran that M. Hennebeau was at the pit, and they\r\ntalked of letting him down by the neck, to see if he would hew his\r\ncoal himself. But it was a false report; only N\xc3\xa9grel and Dansaert were\r\nthere. They both showed themselves for a moment at a window of the\r\nreceiving-room; the head captain stood in the background, rather out\r\nof countenance since his adventure with Pierronne, while the engineer\r\nbravely looked round on the crowd with his bright little eyes, smiling\r\nwith that sneering contempt in which he enveloped men and things\r\ngenerally. Hooting arose, and they disappeared. And in their place\r\nonly Souvarine\'s pale face was seen. He was just then on duty; he had\r\nnot left his engine for a single day since the strike began, no longer\r\ntalking, more and more absorbed by a fixed idea, which seemed to be\r\nshining like steel in the depths of his pale eyes.\r\n\r\n"Keep off!" repeated the captain loudly. "I wish to hear nothing. My\r\norders are to guard the pit, and I shall guard it. And do not press on\r\nto my men, or I shall know how to drive you back."\r\n\r\nIn spite of his firm voice, he was growing pale with increasing\r\nanxiety, as the flood of miners continued to swell. He would be\r\nrelieved at midday; but fearing that he would not be able to hold out\r\nuntil then, he had sent a trammer from the pit to Montsou to ask for\r\nreinforcements.\r\n\r\nShouts had replied to him:\r\n\r\n"Kill the blacklegs! Kill the Borains! We mean to be masters in our own\r\nplace!"\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne drew back in despair. The end had come; there was nothing more\r\nexcept to fight and to die. And he ceased to hold back his mates. The\r\nmob moved up to the little troop. There were nearly four hundred of\r\nthem, and the people from the neighbouring settlements were all running\r\nup. They all shouted the same cry. Maheu and Levaque said furiously to\r\nthe soldiers:\r\n\r\n"Get off with you! We have nothing against you! Get off with you!"\r\n\r\n"This doesn\'t concern you," said Maheude. "Let us attend to our own\r\naffairs."\r\n\r\nAnd from behind, the Levaque woman added, more violently:\r\n\r\n"Must we eat you to get through? Just clear out of the bloody place!"\r\n\r\nEven Lydie\'s shrill voice was heard. She had crammed herself in more\r\nclosely, with B\xc3\xa9bert, and was saying, in a high voice:\r\n\r\n"Oh, the pale-livered pigs!"\r\n\r\nCatherine, a few paces off, was gazing and listening, stupefied by\r\nnew scenes of violence, into the midst of which ill luck seemed to be\r\nalways throwing her. Had she not suffered too much already? What fault\r\nhad she committed, then, that misfortune would never give her any rest?\r\nThe day before she had understood nothing of the fury of the strike;\r\nshe thought that when one has one\'s share of blows it is useless to\r\ngo and seek for more. And now her heart was swelling with hatred;\r\nshe remembered what \xc3\x89tienne had often told her when they used to sit\r\nup; she tried to hear what he was now saying to the soldiers. He was\r\ntreating them as mates; he reminded them that they also belonged to the\r\npeople, and that they ought to be on the side of the people against\r\nthose who took advantage of their wretchedness.\r\n\r\nBut a tremor ran through the crowd, and an old woman rushed up. It was\r\nMother Brul\xc3\xa9, terrible in her leanness, with her neck and arms in the\r\nair, coming up at such a pace that the wisps of her grey hair blinded\r\nher.\r\n\r\n"Ah! by God! here I am," she stammered, out of breath; "that traitor\r\nPierron, who shut me up in the cellar!"\r\n\r\nAnd without waiting she fell on the soldiers, her black mouth belching\r\nabuse.\r\n\r\n"Pack of scoundrels! dirty scum! ready to lick their masters\' boots,\r\nand only brave against poor people!"\r\n\r\nThen the others joined her, and there were volleys of insults. A\r\nfew, indeed, cried: "Hurrah for the soldiers! to the shaft with the\r\nofficer!" but soon there was only one clamour: "Down with the red\r\nbreeches!" These men, who had listened quietly, with motionless mute\r\nfaces, to the fraternal appeals and the friendly attempts to win them\r\nover, preserved the same stiff passivity beneath this hail of abuse.\r\nBehind them the captain had drawn his sword, and as the crowd pressed\r\nin on them more and more, threatening to crush them against the wall,\r\nhe ordered them to present bayonets. They obeyed, and a double row of\r\nsteel points was placed in front of the strikers\' breasts.\r\n\r\n"Ah! the bloody swine!" yelled Mother Brul\xc3\xa9, drawing back.\r\n\r\nBut already they were coming on again, in excited contempt of death.\r\nThe women were throwing themselves forward, Maheude and the Levaque\r\nshouting:\r\n\r\n"Kill us! Kill us, then! We want our rights!"\r\n\r\nLevaque, at the risk of getting cut, had seized three bayonets in his\r\nhands, shaking and pulling them in the effort to snatch them away. He\r\ntwisted them in the strength of his fury; while Bouteloup, standing\r\naside, and annoyed at having followed his mate, quietly watched him.\r\n\r\n"Just come and look here," said Maheu; "just look a bit if you are good\r\nchaps!"\r\n\r\nAnd he opened his jacket and drew aside his shirt, showing his\r\nnaked breast, with his hairy skin tattooed by coal. He pressed on\r\nthe bayonets, compelling the soldiers to draw back, terrible in his\r\ninsolence and bravado. One of them had pricked him in the chest, and he\r\nbecame like a madman, trying to make it enter deeper and to hear his\r\nribs crack.\r\n\r\n"Cowards, you don\'t dare! There are ten thousand behind us. Yes, you\r\ncan kill us; there are ten thousand more of us to kill yet."\r\n\r\nThe position of the soldiers was becoming critical, for they had\r\nreceived strict orders not to make use of their weapons until the last\r\nextremity. And how were they to prevent these furious people from\r\nimpaling themselves? Besides, the space was getting less; they were now\r\npushed back against the wall, and it was impossible to draw further\r\nback. Their little troop--a mere handful of men--opposed to the rising\r\nflood of miners, still held its own, however, and calmly executed the\r\nbrief orders given by the captain. The latter, with keen eyes and\r\nnervously compressed lips, only feared lest they should be carried away\r\nby this abuse. Already a young sergeant, a tall lean fellow whose thin\r\nmoustache was bristling up, was blinking his eyes in a disquieting\r\nmanner. Near him an old soldier, with tanned skin and stripes won in\r\ntwenty campaigns, had grown pale when he saw his bayonet twisted like a\r\nstraw. Another, doubtless a recruit still smelling the fields, became\r\nvery red every time he heard himself called "scum" and "riff-raff."\r\nAnd the violence did not cease, the outstretched fists, the abominable\r\nwords, the shovelfuls of accusations and threats which buffeted their\r\nfaces. It required all the force of order to keep them thus, with mute\r\nfaces, in the proud, gloomy silence of military discipline.\r\n\r\nA collision seemed inevitable, when Captain Richomme appeared from\r\nbehind the troop with his benevolent white head, overwhelmed by\r\nemotion. He spoke out loudly:\r\n\r\n"By God! this is idiotic! such tomfoolery can\'t go on!"\r\n\r\nAnd he threw himself between the bayonets and the miners.\r\n\r\n"Mates, listen to me. You know that I am an old workman, and that I\r\nhave always been one of you. Well, by God! I promise you, that if\r\nthey\'re not just with you, I\'m the man to go and say to the bosses how\r\nthings lie. But this is too much, it does no good at all to howl bad\r\nnames at these good fellows, and try and get your bellies ripped up."\r\n\r\nThey listened, hesitating. But up above, unfortunately, little N\xc3\xa9grel\'s\r\nshort profile reappeared. He feared, no doubt, that he would be accused\r\nof sending a captain in place of venturing out himself; and he tried\r\nto speak. But his voice was lost in the midst of so frightful a tumult\r\nthat he had to leave the window again, simply shrugging his shoulders.\r\nRichomme then found it vain to entreat them in his own name, and to\r\nrepeat that the thing must be arranged between mates; they repelled\r\nhim, suspecting him. But he was obstinate and remained amongst them.\r\n\r\n"By God! let them break my head as well as yours, for I don\'t leave you\r\nwhile you are so foolish!"\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne, whom he begged to help him in making them hear reason, made\r\na gesture of powerlessness. It was too late, there were now more than\r\nfive hundred of them. And besides the madmen who were rushing up to\r\nchase away the Borains, some came out of inquisitiveness, or to joke\r\nand amuse themselves over the battle. In the midst of one group, at\r\nsome distance, Zacharie and Philom\xc3\xa9ne were looking on as at a theatre\r\nso peacefully that they had brought their two children, Achille and\r\nD\xc3\xa9sir\xc3\xa9e. Another stream was arriving from R\xc3\xa9quillart, including Mouquet\r\nand Mouquette. The former at once went on, grinning, to slap his friend\r\nZacharie on the back; while Mouquette, in a very excited condition,\r\nrushed to the first rank of the evil-disposed.\r\n\r\nEvery minute, however, the captain looked down the Montsou road. The\r\ndesired reinforcements had not arrived, and his sixty men could hold\r\nout no longer. At last it occurred to him to strike the imagination of\r\nthe crowd, and he ordered his men to load. The soldiers executed the\r\norder, but the disturbance increased, the blustering, and the mockery.\r\n\r\n"Ah! these shammers, they\'re going off to the target!" jeered the\r\nwomen, the Brul\xc3\xa9, the Levaque, and the others.\r\n\r\nMaheude, with her breast covered by the little body of Estelle, who was\r\nawake and crying, came so near that the sergeant asked her what she was\r\ngoing to do with that poor little brat.\r\n\r\n"What the devil\'s that to do with you?" she replied. "Fire at it if you\r\ndare!"\r\n\r\nThe men shook their heads with contempt. None believed that they would\r\nfire on them.\r\n\r\n"There are no balls in their cartridges," said Levaque.\r\n\r\n"Are we Cossacks?" cried Maheu. "You don\'t fire against Frenchmen, by\r\nGod!"\r\n\r\nOthers said that when people had been through the Crimean campaign they\r\nwere not afraid of lead. And all continued to thrust themselves on to\r\nthe rifles. If firing had begun at this moment the crowd would have\r\nbeen mown down.\r\n\r\nIn the front rank Mouquette was choking with fury, thinking that the\r\nsoldiers were going to gash the women\'s skins. She had spat out all\r\nher coarse words at them, and could find no vulgarity low enough, when\r\nsuddenly, having nothing left but that mortal offence with which to\r\nbombard the faces of the troop, she exhibited her backside. With both\r\nhands she raised her skirts, bent her back, and expanded the enormous\r\nrotundity.\r\n\r\n"Here, that\'s for you! and it\'s a lot too clean, you dirty blackguards!"\r\n\r\nShe ducked and butted so that each might have his share, repeating\r\nafter each thrust:\r\n\r\n"There\'s for the officer! there\'s for the sergeant! there\'s for the\r\nsoldiers!"\r\n\r\nA tempest of laughter arose; B\xc3\xa9bert and Lydie were in convulsions;\r\n\xc3\x89tienne himself, in spite of his sombre expectation, applauded this\r\ninsulting nudity. All of them, the banterers as well as the infuriated,\r\nwere now hooting the soldiers as though they had seen them stained by\r\na splash of filth; Catherine only, standing aside on some old timber,\r\nremained silent with the blood at her heart, slowly carried away by the\r\nhatred that was rising within her.\r\n\r\nBut a hustling took place. To calm the excitement of his men, the\r\ncaptain decided to make prisoners. With a leap Mouquette escaped,\r\nsaving herself between the legs of her comrades. Three miners, Levaque\r\nand two others, were seized among the more violent, and kept in sight\r\nat the other end of the captains\' room. N\xc3\xa9grel and Dansaert, above,\r\nwere shouting to the captain to come in and take refuge with them. He\r\nrefused; he felt that these buildings with their doors without locks\r\nwould be carried by assault, and that he would undergo the shame of\r\nbeing disarmed. His little troop was already growling with impatience;\r\nit was impossible to flee before these wretches in sabots. The sixty,\r\nwith their backs to the wall and their rifles loaded, again faced the\r\nmob.\r\n\r\nAt first there was a recoil, followed by deep silence; the strikers\r\nwere astonished at this energetic stroke. Then a cry arose calling for\r\nthe prisoners, demanding their immediate release. Some voices said that\r\nthey were being murdered in there. And without any attempt at concerted\r\naction, carried away by the same impulse, by the same desire for\r\nrevenge, they all ran to the piles of bricks which stood near, those\r\nbricks for which the marly soil supplied the clay, and which were baked\r\non the spot. The children brought them one by one, and the women filled\r\ntheir skirts with them. Every one soon had her ammunition at her feet,\r\nand the battle of stones began.\r\n\r\nIt was Mother Brul\xc3\xa9 who set to first. She broke the bricks on the\r\nsharp edge of her knee, and with both hands she discharged the two\r\nfragments. The Levaque woman was almost putting her shoulders out,\r\nbeing so large and soft that she had to come near to get her aim, in\r\nspite of Bouteloup\'s entreaties, and he dragged her back in the hope of\r\nbeing able to lead her away now that her husband had been taken off.\r\nThey all grew excited, and Mouquette, tired of making herself bleed\r\nby breaking the bricks on her overfat thighs, preferred to throw them\r\nwhole. Even the youngsters came into line, and B\xc3\xa9bert showed Lydie how\r\nthe brick ought to be sent from under the elbow. It was a shower of\r\nenormous hailstones, producing low thuds. And suddenly, in the midst\r\nof these furies, Catherine was observed with her fists in the air also\r\nbrandishing half-bricks and throwing them with all the force of her\r\nlittle arms. She could not have said why, she was suffocating, she was\r\ndying of the desire to kill everybody. Would it not soon be done with,\r\nthis cursed life of misfortune? She had had enough of it, beaten and\r\ndriven away by her man, wandering about like a lost dog in the mud of\r\nthe roads, without being able to ask a crust from her father, who was\r\nstarving like herself. Things never seemed to get better; they were\r\ngetting worse ever since she could remember. And she broke the bricks\r\nand threw them before her with the one idea of sweeping everything\r\naway, her eyes so blinded that she could not even see whose jaws she\r\nmight be crushing.\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne, who had remained in front of the soldiers, nearly had his\r\nskull broken. His ear was grazed, and turning round he started when he\r\nrealized that the brick had come from Catherine\'s feverish hands; but\r\nat the risk of being killed he remained where he was, gazing at her.\r\nMany others also forgot themselves there, absorbed in the battle, with\r\nempty hands. Mouquet criticized the blows as though he were looking\r\non at a game of _bouchon_. Oh, that was well struck! and that\r\nother, no luck! He joked, and with his elbow pushed Zacharie, who was\r\nsquabbling with Philom\xc3\xa9ne because he had boxed Achille\'s and D\xc3\xa9sir\xc3\xa9e\'s\r\nears, refusing to put them on his back so that they could see. There\r\nwere spectators crowded all along the road. And at the top of the slope\r\nnear the entrance to the settlement, old Bonnemort appeared, resting on\r\nhis stick, motionless against the rust-coloured sky.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the first bricks were thrown, Captain Richomme had again\r\nplaced himself between the soldiers and the miners. He was entreating\r\nthe one party, exhorting the other party, careless of danger, in such\r\ndespair that large tears were flowing from his eyes. It was impossible\r\nto hear his words in the midst of the tumult; only his large grey\r\nmoustache could be seen moving.\r\n\r\nBut the hail of bricks came faster; the men were joining in, following\r\nthe example of the women.\r\n\r\nThen Maheude noticed that Maheu was standing behind with empty hands\r\nand sombre air.\r\n\r\n"What\'s up with you?" she shouted. "Are you a coward? Are you going to\r\nlet your mates be carried off to prison? Ah! if only I hadn\'t got this\r\nchild, you should see!"\r\n\r\nEstelle, who was clinging to her neck, screaming, prevented her from\r\njoining Mother Brul\xc3\xa9 and the others. And as her man did not seem to\r\nhear, she kicked some bricks against his legs.\r\n\r\n"By God! will you take that? Must I spit in your face before people to\r\nget your spirits up?"\r\n\r\nBecoming very red, he broke some bricks and threw them. She lashed\r\nhim on, dazing him, shouting behind him cries of death, stifling her\r\ndaughter against her breast with the spasm of her arms; and he still\r\nmoved forward until he was opposite the guns.\r\n\r\nBeneath this shower of stones the little troop was disappearing.\r\nFortunately they struck too high, and the wall was riddled. What was\r\nto be done? The idea of going in, of turning their backs for a moment\r\nturned the captain\'s pale face purple; but it was no longer possible,\r\nthey would be torn to pieces at the least movement. A brick had just\r\nbroken the peak of his cap, drops of blood were running down his\r\nforehead. Several of his men were wounded; and he felt that they were\r\nlosing self-control in that unbridled instinct of self-defence when\r\nobedience to leaders ceases. The sergeant had uttered a "By God!" for\r\nhis left shoulder had nearly been put out, and his flesh bruised by a\r\nshock like the blow of a washerwoman\'s beetle against linen. Grazed\r\ntwice over, the recruit had his thumb smashed, while his right knee was\r\ngrazed. Were they to let themselves be worried much longer? A stone\r\nhaving bounded back and struck the old soldier with the stripes beneath\r\nthe belly, his cheeks turned green, and his weapon trembled as he\r\nstretched it out at the end of his lean arms. Three times the captain\r\nwas on the point of ordering them to fire. He was choked by anguish;\r\nan endless struggle for several seconds set at odds in his mind all\r\nideas and duties, all his beliefs as a man and as a soldier. The rain\r\nof bricks increased, and he opened his mouth and was about to shout\r\n"Fire!" when the guns went off of themselves three shots at first,\r\nthen five, then the roll of a volley, then one by itself, some time\r\nafterwards, in the deep silence.\r\n\r\nThere was stupefaction on all sides. They had fired, and the gaping\r\ncrowd stood motionless, as yet unable to believe it. But heart-rending\r\ncries arose while the bugle was sounding to cease firing. And here was\r\na mad panic, the rush of cattle filled with grapeshot, a wild flight\r\nthrough the mud. B\xc3\xa9bert and Lydie had fallen one on top of the other\r\nat the first three shots, the little girl struck in the face, the boy\r\nwounded beneath the left shoulder. She was crushed, and never stirred\r\nagain. But he moved, seized her with both arms in the convulsion of his\r\nagony, as if he wanted to take her again, as he had taken her at the\r\nbottom of the black hiding-place where they had spent the past night.\r\nAnd Jeanlin, who just then ran up from R\xc3\xa9quillart still half asleep,\r\nkicking about in the midst of the smoke, saw him embrace his little\r\nwife and die.\r\n\r\nThe five other shots had brought down Mother Brul\xc3\xa9 and Captain\r\nRichomme. Struck in the back as he was entreating his mates, he had\r\nfallen on to his knees, and slipping on to one hip he was groaning on\r\nthe ground with eyes still full of tears. The old woman, whose breast\r\nhad been opened, had fallen back stiff and crackling, like a bundle of\r\ndry faggots, stammering one last oath in the gurgling of blood.\r\n\r\nBut then the volley swept the field, mowing down the inquisitive groups\r\nwho were laughing at the battle a hundred paces off. A ball entered\r\nMouquet\'s mouth and threw him down with fractured skull at the feet of\r\nZacharie and Philom\xc3\xa9ne, whose two youngsters were splashed with red\r\ndrops. At the same moment Mouquette received two balls in the belly.\r\nShe had seen the soldiers take aim, and in an instinctive movement of\r\nher good nature she had thrown herself in front of Catherine, shouting\r\nout to her to take care; she uttered a loud cry and fell on to her\r\nback overturned by the shock. \xc3\x89tienne ran up, wishing to raise her and\r\ntake her away; but with a gesture she said it was all over. Then she\r\ngroaned, but without ceasing to smile at both of them, as though she\r\nwere glad to see them together now that she was going away.\r\n\r\nAll seemed to be over, and the hurricane of balls was lost in the\r\ndistance as far as the frontages of the settlement, when the last\r\nshot, isolated and delayed, was fired. Maheu, struck in the heart,\r\nturned round and fell with his face down into a puddle black with coal.\r\nMaheude leant down in stupefaction.\r\n\r\n"Eh! old man, get up. It\'s nothing, is it?"\r\n\r\nHer hands were engaged with Estelle, whom she had to put under one arm\r\nin order to turn her man\'s head.\r\n\r\n"Say something! where are you hurt?"\r\n\r\nHis eyes were vacant, and his mouth was slavered with bloody foam. She\r\nunderstood: he was dead. Then she remained seated in the mud with her\r\ndaughter under her arm like a bundle, gazing at her old man with a\r\nbesotted air.\r\n\r\nThe pit was free. With a nervous movement the captain had taken off\r\nand then put on his cap, struck by a stone; he preserved his pallid\r\nstiffness in face of the disaster of his life, while his men with mute\r\nfaces were reloading. The frightened faces of N\xc3\xa9grel and Dansaert could\r\nbe seen at the window of the receiving-room. Souvarine was behind them\r\nwith a deep wrinkle on his forehead, as though the nail of his fixed\r\nidea had printed itself there threateningly. On the other side of the\r\nhorizon, at the edge of the plain, Bonnemort had not moved, supported\r\nby one hand on his stick, the other hand up to his brows to see better\r\nthe murder of his people below. The wounded were howling, the dead were\r\ngrowing cold, in twisted postures, muddy with the liquid mud of the\r\nthaw, here and there forming puddles among the inky patches of coal\r\nwhich reappeared beneath the tattered snow. And in the midst of these\r\nhuman corpses, all small, poor and lean in their wretchedness, lay\r\nTrompette\'s carcass, a monstrous and pitiful mass of dead flesh.\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne had not been killed. He was still waiting beside Catherine, who\r\nhad fallen from fatigue and anguish, when a sonorous voice made him\r\nstart. It was Abb\xc3\xa9 Ranvier, who was coming back after saying mass, and\r\nwho, with both arms in the air, with the inspired fury of a prophet,\r\nwas calling the wrath of God down on the murderers. He foretold the era\r\nof justice, the approaching extermination of the middle class by fire\r\nfrom heaven, since it was bringing its crimes to a climax by massacring\r\nthe workers and the disinherited of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART SEVEN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\n\r\nThe shots fired at Montsou had reached as far as Paris with a\r\nformidable echo. For four days all the opposition journals had been\r\nindignant, displaying atrocious narratives on their front pages:\r\ntwenty-five wounded, fourteen dead, including three women and two\r\nchildren. And there were prisoners taken as well; Levaque had become a\r\nsort of hero, and was credited with a reply of antique sublimity to the\r\nexamining magistrate. The empire, hit in mid career by these few balls,\r\naffected the calm of omnipotence, without itself realizing the gravity\r\nof its wound. It was simply an unfortunate collision, something lost\r\nover there in the black country, very far from the Parisian boulevards\r\nwhich formed public opinion; it would soon be forgotten. The Company\r\nhad received official intimation to hush up the affair, and to put\r\nan end to a strike which from its irritating duration was becoming a\r\nsocial danger.\r\n\r\nSo on Wednesday morning three of the directors appeared at Montsou. The\r\nlittle town, sick at heart, which had not dared hitherto to rejoice\r\nover the massacre, now breathed again, and tasted the joy of being\r\nsaved. The weather, too, had become fine; there was a bright sun--one\r\nof those first February days which, with their moist warmth, tip the\r\nlilac shoots with green. All the shutters had been flung back at the\r\nadministration building, the vast structure seemed alive again. And\r\ncheering rumours were circulating; it was said that the directors,\r\ndeeply affected by the catastrophe, had rushed down to open their\r\npaternal arms to the wanderers from the settlements. Now that the\r\nblow had fallen--a more vigorous one doubtless than they had wished\r\nfor--they were prodigal in their task of relief, and decreed measures\r\nthat were excellent though tardy. First of all they sent away the\r\nBorains, and made much of this extreme concession to their workmen.\r\nThen they put an end to the military occupation of the pits, which\r\nwere no longer threatened by the crushed strikers. They also obtained\r\nsilence regarding the sentinel who had disappeared from the Voreux;\r\nthe district had been searched without finding either the gun or the\r\ncorpse, and although there was a suspicion of crime, it was decided\r\nto consider the soldier a deserter. In every way they thus tried to\r\nattenuate matters, trembling with fear for the morrow, judging it\r\ndangerous to acknowledge the irresistible savagery of a crowd set free\r\namid the falling structure of the old world. And besides, this work of\r\nconciliation did not prevent them from bringing purely administrative\r\naffairs to a satisfactory conclusion; for Deneulin had been seen to\r\nreturn to the administration buildings, where he met M. Hennebeau.\r\nThe negotiations for the purchase of Vandame continued, and it was\r\nconsidered certain that Deneulin would accept the Company\'s offers.\r\n\r\nBut what particularly stirred the country were the great yellow posters\r\nwhich the directors had stuck up in profusion on the walls. On them\r\nwere to be read these few lines, in very large letters: "Workers of\r\nMontsou! We do not wish that the errors of which you have lately seen\r\nthe sad effects should deprive sensible and willing workmen of their\r\nlivelihood. We shall therefore reopen all the pits on Monday morning,\r\nand when work is resumed we shall examine with care and consideration\r\nthose cases in which there may be room for improvement. We shall, in\r\nfact, do all that is just or possible to do." In one morning the ten\r\nthousand colliers passed before these placards. Not one of them spoke,\r\nmany shook their heads, others went away with trailing steps, without\r\nchanging one line in their motionless faces.\r\n\r\nUp till now the settlement of the Deux-Cent-Quarante had persisted in\r\nits fierce resistance. It seemed that the blood of their mates, which\r\nhad reddened the mud of the pit, was barricading the road against\r\nthe others. Scarcely a dozen had gone down, merely Pierron and some\r\nsneaks of his sort, whose departure and arrival were gloomily watched\r\nwithout a gesture or a threat. Therefore a deep suspicion greeted the\r\nplacard stuck on to the church. Nothing was said about the returned\r\ncertificates in that. Would the Company refuse to take them on again?\r\nand the fear of retaliations, the fraternal idea of protesting against\r\nthe dismissal of the more compromised men, made them all obstinate\r\nstill. It was dubious; they would see. They would return to the pit\r\nwhen these gentlemen were good enough to put things plainly. Silence\r\ncrushed the low houses. Hunger itself seemed nothing; all might die now\r\nthat violent death had passed over their roofs.\r\n\r\nBut one house, that of the Maheus, remained especially black and mute\r\nin its overwhelming grief. Since she had followed her man to the\r\ncemetery, Maheude kept her teeth clenched. After the battle, she had\r\nallowed \xc3\x89tienne to bring back Catherine muddy and half dead; and as she\r\nwas undressing her, before the young man, in order to put her to bed,\r\nshe thought for a moment that her daughter also had received a ball\r\nin the belly, for the chemise was marked with large patches of blood.\r\nBut she soon understood that it was the flood of puberty, which was\r\nat last breaking out in the shock of this abominable day. Ah! another\r\npiece of luck, that wound! A fine present, to be able to make children\r\nfor the gendarmes to kill; and she never spoke to Catherine, nor did\r\nshe, indeed, talk to \xc3\x89tienne. The latter slept with Jeanlin, at the\r\nrisk of being arrested, seized by such horror at the idea of going back\r\nto the darkness of R\xc3\xa9quillart that he would have preferred a prison.\r\nA shudder shook him, the horror of the night after all those deaths,\r\nan unacknowledged fear of the little soldier who slept down there\r\nunderneath the rocks. Besides, he dreamed of a prison as of a refuge\r\nin the midst of the torment of his defeat; but they did not trouble\r\nhim, and he dragged on his wretched hours, not knowing how to weary out\r\nhis body. Only at times Maheude looked at both of them, at him and her\r\ndaughter, with a spiteful air, as though she were asking them what they\r\nwere doing in her house.\r\n\r\nOnce more they were all snoring in a heap. Father Bonnemort occupied\r\nthe former bed of the two youngsters, who slept with Catherine now\r\nthat poor Alzire no longer dug her hump into her big sister\'s ribs. It\r\nwas when going to bed that the mother felt the emptiness of the house\r\nby the coldness of her bed, which was now too large. In vain she took\r\nEstelle to fill the vacancy; that did not replace her man, and she wept\r\nquietly for hours. Then the days began to pass by as before, always\r\nwithout bread, but without the luck to die outright; things picked up\r\nhere and there rendered to the wretches the poor service of keeping\r\nthem alive. Nothing had changed in their existence, only her man was\r\ngone.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of the fifth day, \xc3\x89tienne, made miserable by the sight\r\nof this silent woman, left the room, and walked slowly along the paved\r\nstreet of the settlement. The inaction which weighed on him impelled\r\nhim to take constant walks, with arms swinging idly and lowered head,\r\nalways tortured by the same thought. He tramped thus for half an hour,\r\nwhen he felt, by an increase in his discomfort, that his mates were\r\ncoming to their doors to look at him. His little remaining popularity\r\nhad been driven to the winds by that fusillade, and he never passed\r\nnow without meeting fiery looks which pursued him. When he raised his\r\nhead there were threatening men there, women drawing aside the curtains\r\nfrom their windows; and beneath this still silent accusation and the\r\nrestrained anger of these eyes, enlarged by hunger and tears, he became\r\nawkward and could scarcely walk straight. These dumb reproaches seemed\r\nto be always increasing behind him. He became so terrified, lest he\r\nshould hear the entire settlement come out to shout its wretchedness at\r\nhim, that he returned shuddering. But at the Maheus\' the scene which\r\nmet him still further agitated him. Old Bonnemort was near the cold\r\nfireplace, nailed to his chair ever since two neighbours, on the day\r\nof the slaughter, had found him on the ground, with his stick broken,\r\nstruck down like an old thunder-stricken tree. And while L\xc3\xa9nore and\r\nHenri, to beguile their hunger, were scraping, with deafening noise, an\r\nold saucepan in which cabbages had been boiled the day before, Maheude,\r\nafter having placed Estelle on the table, was standing up threatening\r\nCatherine with her fist.\r\n\r\n"Say that again, by God! Just dare to say that again!"\r\n\r\nCatherine had declared her intention to go back to the Voreux. The\r\nidea of not gaining her bread, of being thus tolerated in her mother\'s\r\nhouse, like a useless animal that is in the way, was becoming every\r\nday more unbearable; and if it had not been for the fear of Chaval she\r\nwould have gone down on Tuesday.\r\n\r\nShe said again, stammering:\r\n\r\n"What would you have? We can\'t go on doing nothing. We should get\r\nbread, anyhow."\r\n\r\nMaheude interrupted her.\r\n\r\n"Listen to me: the first one of you who goes to work, I\'ll do for you.\r\nNo, that would be too much, to kill the father and go on taking it out\r\nof the children! I\'ve had enough of it; I\'d rather see you all put in\r\nyour coffins, like him that\'s gone already."\r\n\r\nAnd her long silence broke out into a furious flood of words. A fine\r\nsum Catherine would bring her! hardly thirty sous, to which they might\r\nadd twenty sous if the bosses were good enough to find work for that\r\nbrigand Jeanlin. Fifty sous, and seven mouths to feed! The brats were\r\nonly good to swallow soup. As to the grandfather, he must have broken\r\nsomething in his brain when he fell, for he seemed imbecile; unless it\r\nhad turned his blood to see the soldiers firing at his mates.\r\n\r\n"That\'s it, old man, isn\'t it? They\'ve quite done for you. It\'s no good\r\nhaving your hands still strong; you\'re done for."\r\n\r\nBonnemort looked at her with his dim eyes without understanding. He\r\nremained for hours with fixed gaze, having no intelligence now except\r\nto spit into a plate filled with ashes, which was put beside him for\r\ncleanliness.\r\n\r\n"And they\'ve not settled his pension, either," she went on. "And I\'m\r\nsure they won\'t give it, because of our ideas. No! I tell you that\r\nwe\'ve had too much to do with those people who bring ill luck."\r\n\r\n"But," Catherine ventured to say, "they promise on the placard--"\r\n\r\n"Just let me alone with your damned placard! More birdlime for catching\r\nus and eating us. They can be mighty kind now that they have ripped us\r\nopen."\r\n\r\n"But where shall we go, mother? They won\'t keep us at the settlement,\r\nsure enough."\r\n\r\nMaheude made a vague, terrified gesture. Where should they go to? She\r\ndid not know at all; she avoided thinking, it made her mad. They would\r\ngo elsewhere--somewhere. And as the noise of the saucepan was becoming\r\nunbearable, she turned round on L\xc3\xa9nore and Henri and boxed their ears.\r\nThe fall of Estelle, who had been crawling on all fours, increased the\r\ndisturbance. The mother quieted her with a push--a good thing if it had\r\nkilled her! She spoke of Alzire; she wished the others might have that\r\nchild\'s luck. Then suddenly she burst out into loud sobs, with her head\r\nagainst the wall.\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne, who was standing by, did not dare to interfere. He no longer\r\ncounted for anything in the house, and even the children drew back from\r\nhim suspiciously. But the unfortunate woman\'s tears went to his heart,\r\nand he murmured:\r\n\r\n"Come, come! courage! we must try to get out of it."\r\n\r\nShe did not seem to hear him, and was bemoaning herself now in a low\r\ncontinuous complaint.\r\n\r\n"Ah! the wretchedness! is it possible? Things did go on before these\r\nhorrors. We ate our bread dry, but we were all together; and what has\r\nhappened, good God! What have we done, then, that we should have such\r\ntroubles--some under the earth, and the others with nothing left but\r\nto long to get there too? It\'s true enough that they harnessed us\r\nlike horses to work, and it\'s not at all a just sharing of things to\r\nbe always getting the stick and making rich people\'s fortunes bigger\r\nwithout hope of ever tasting the good things. There\'s no pleasure in\r\nlife when hope goes. Yes, that couldn\'t have gone on longer; we had to\r\nbreathe a bit. If we had only known! Is it possible to make oneself so\r\nwretched through wanting justice?"\r\n\r\nSighs swelled her breast, and her voice choked with immense sadness.\r\n\r\n"Then there are always some clever people there who promise you that\r\neverything can be arranged by just taking a little trouble. Then one\r\nloses one\'s head, and one suffers so much from things as they are that\r\none asks for things that can\'t be. Now, I was dreaming like a fool; I\r\nseemed to see a life of good friendship with everybody; I went off into\r\nthe air, my faith! into the clouds. And then one breaks one\'s back when\r\none tumbles down into the mud again. It\'s not true; there\'s nothing\r\nover there of the things that people tell of. What there is, is only\r\nwretchedness, ah! wretchedness, as much as you like of it, and bullets\r\ninto the bargain."\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne listened to this lamentation, and every tear struck him with\r\nremorse. He knew not what to say to calm Maheude, broken by her\r\nterrible fall from the heights of the ideal. She had come back to the\r\nmiddle of the room, and was now looking at him; she addressed him with\r\ncontemptuous familiarity in a last cry of rage:\r\n\r\n"And you, do you talk of going back to the pit, too, after driving us\r\nout of the bloody place! I\'ve nothing to reproach you with; but if I\r\nwere in your shoes I should be dead of grief by now after causing such\r\nharm to the mates."\r\n\r\nHe was about to reply, but then shrugged his shoulders in despair. What\r\nwas the good of explaining, for she would not understand in her grief?\r\nAnd he went away, for he was suffering too much, and resumed his wild\r\nwalk outside.\r\n\r\nThere again he found the settlement apparently waiting for him, the\r\nmen at the doors, the women at the windows. As soon as he appeared\r\ngrowls were heard, and the crowd increased. The breath of gossip,\r\nwhich had been swelling for four days, was breaking out in a universal\r\nmalediction. Fists were stretched towards him, mothers spitefully\r\npointed him out to their boys, old men spat as they looked at him. It\r\nwas the change which follows on the morrow of defeat, the fatal reverse\r\nof popularity, an execration exasperated by all the suffering endured\r\nwithout result. He had to pay for famine and death.\r\n\r\nZacharie, who came up with Philom\xc3\xa9ne, hustled \xc3\x89tienne as he went out,\r\ngrinning maliciously.\r\n\r\n"Well, he gets fat. It\'s filling, then, to live on other people\'s\r\ndeaths?"\r\n\r\nThe Levaque woman had already come to her door with Bouteloup. She\r\nspoke of B\xc3\xa9bert, her youngster, killed by a bullet, and cried:\r\n\r\n"Yes, there are cowards who get children murdered! Let him go and look\r\nfor mine in the earth if he wants to give it me back!"\r\n\r\nShe was forgetting her man in prison, for the household was going on\r\nsince Bouteloup remained; but she thought of him, however, and went on\r\nin a shrill voice:\r\n\r\n"Get along! rascals may walk about while good people are put away!"\r\n\r\nIn avoiding her, \xc3\x89tienne tumbled on to Pierronne, who was running\r\nup across the gardens. She had regarded her mother\'s death as a\r\ndeliverance, for the old woman\'s violence threatened to get them\r\nhanged; nor did she weep over Pierron\'s little girl, that street-walker\r\nLydie--a good riddance. But she joined in with her neighbours with the\r\nidea of getting reconciled with them.\r\n\r\n"And my mother, eh, and the little girl? You were seen; you were hiding\r\nyourself behind them when they caught the lead instead of you!"\r\n\r\nWhat was to be done? Strangle Pierronne and the others, and fight the\r\nwhole settlement? \xc3\x89tienne wanted to do so for a moment. The blood was\r\nthrobbing in his head, he now looked upon his mates as brutes, he was\r\nirritated to see them so unintelligent and barbarous that they wanted\r\nto revenge themselves on him for the logic of facts. How stupid it all\r\nwas! and he felt disgust at his powerlessness to tame them again; and\r\nsatisfied himself with hastening his steps as though he were deaf to\r\nabuse. Soon it became a flight; every house hooted him as he passed,\r\nthey hastened on his heels, it was a whole nation cursing him with a\r\nvoice that was becoming like thunder in its overwhelming hatred. It\r\nwas he, the exploiter, the murderer, who was the sole cause of their\r\nmisfortune. He rushed out of the settlement, pale and terrified, with\r\nthis yelling crowd behind his back. When he at last reached the main\r\nroad most of them left him; but a few persisted, until at the bottom\r\nof the slope before the Avantage he met another group coming from the\r\nVoreux.\r\n\r\nOld Mouque and Chaval were there. Since the death of his daughter\r\nMouquette, and of his son Mouquet, the old man had continued to act\r\nas groom without a word of regret or complaint. Suddenly, when he saw\r\n\xc3\x89tienne, he was shaken by fury, tears broke out from his eyes, and a\r\nflood of coarse words burst from his mouth, black and bleeding from his\r\nhabit of chewing tobacco.\r\n\r\n"You devil! you bloody swine! you filthy snout! Wait, you\'ve got to pay\r\nme for my poor children; you\'ll have to come to it!"\r\n\r\nHe picked up a brick, broke it, and threw both pieces.\r\n\r\n"Yes! yes! clear him off!" shouted Chaval, who was grinning in\r\nexcitement, delighted at this vengeance. "Every one gets his turn; now\r\nyou\'re up against the wall, you dirty hound!"\r\n\r\nAnd he also attacked \xc3\x89tienne with stones. A savage clamour arose; they\r\nall took up bricks, broke them, and threw them, to rip him open, as\r\nthey would like to have done to the soldiers. He was dazed and could\r\nnot flee; he faced them, trying to calm them with phrases. His old\r\nspeeches, once so warmly received, came back to his lips. He repeated\r\nthe words with which he had intoxicated them at the time when he could\r\nkeep them in hand like a faithful flock; but his power was dead, and\r\nonly stones replied to him. He had just been struck on the left arm,\r\nand was drawing back, in great peril, when he found himself hemmed in\r\nagainst the front of the Avantage.\r\n\r\nFor the last few moments Rasseneur had been at his door.\r\n\r\n"Come in," he said simply.\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne hesitated; it choked him to take refuge there.\r\n\r\n"Come in; then I\'ll speak to them."\r\n\r\nHe resigned himself, and took refuge at the other end of the parlour,\r\nwhile the innkeeper filled up the doorway with his broad shoulders.\r\n\r\n"Look here, my friends, just be reasonable. You know very well that\r\nI\'ve never deceived you. I\'ve always been in favour of quietness, and\r\nif you had listened to me, you certainly wouldn\'t be where you are now."\r\n\r\nRolling his shoulders and belly, he went on at length, allowing his\r\nfacile eloquence to flow with the lulling gentleness of warm water. And\r\nall his old success came back; he regained his popularity, naturally\r\nand without an effort, as if he had never been hooted and called a\r\ncoward a month before. Voices arose in approval: "Very good! we are\r\nwith you! that is the way to put it!" Thundering applause broke out.\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne, in the background, grew faint, and there was bitterness at his\r\nheart. He recalled Rasseneur\'s prediction in the forest, threatening\r\nhim with the ingratitude of the mob. What imbecile brutality! What an\r\nabominable forgetfulness of old services! It was a blind force which\r\nconstantly devoured itself. And beneath his anger at seeing these\r\nbrutes spoil their own cause, there was despair at his own fall and\r\nthe tragic end of his ambition. What! was it already done for! He\r\nremembered hearing beneath the beeches three thousand hearts beating\r\nto the echo of his own. On that day he had held his popularity in both\r\nhands. Those people belonged to him; he felt that he was their master.\r\nMad dreams had then intoxicated him. Montsou at his feet, Paris beyond,\r\nbecoming a deputy perhaps, crushing the middle class in a speech, the\r\nfirst speech ever pronounced by a workman in a parliament. And it\r\nwas all over! He awakened, miserable and detested; his people were\r\ndismissing him by flinging bricks.\r\n\r\nRasseneur\'s voice rose higher:\r\n\r\n"Never will violence succeed; the world can\'t be remade in a day. Those\r\nwho have promised you to change it all at one stroke are either making\r\nfun of you or they are rascals!"\r\n\r\n"Bravo! bravo!" shouted the crowd.\r\n\r\nWho then was the guilty one? And this question which \xc3\x89tienne put to\r\nhimself overwhelmed him more than ever. Was it in fact his fault, this\r\nmisfortune which was making him bleed, the wretchedness of some, the\r\nmurder of others, these women, these children, lean, and without bread?\r\nHe had had that lamentable vision one evening before the catastrophe.\r\nBut then a force was lifting him, he was carried away with his mates.\r\nBesides, he had never led them, it was they who led him, who obliged\r\nhim to do things which he would never have done if it were not for the\r\nshock of that crowd pushing behind him. At each new violence he had\r\nbeen stupefied by the course of events, for he had neither foreseen\r\nnor desired any of them. Could he anticipate, for instance, that his\r\nfollowers in the settlement would one day stone him? These infuriated\r\npeople lied when they accused him of having promised them an existence\r\nall fodder and laziness. And in this justification, in this reasoning,\r\nin which he tried to fight against his remorse, was hidden the anxiety\r\nthat he had not risen to the height of his task; it was the doubt of\r\nthe half-cultured man still perplexing him. But he felt himself at the\r\nend of his courage, he was no longer at heart with his mates; he feared\r\nthis enormous mass of the people, blind and irresistible, moving like a\r\nforce of nature, sweeping away everything, outside rules and theories.\r\nA certain repugnance was detaching him from them--the discomfort of his\r\nnew tastes, the slow movement of all his being towards a superior class.\r\n\r\nAt this moment Rasseneur\'s voice was lost in the midst of enthusiastic\r\nshouts:\r\n\r\n"Hurrah for Rasseneur! he\'s the fellow! Bravo, bravo!"\r\n\r\nThe innkeeper shut the door, while the band dispersed; and the two men\r\nlooked at each other in silence. They both shrugged their shoulders.\r\nThey finished up by having a drink together.\r\n\r\nOn the same day there was a great dinner at Piolaine; they were\r\ncelebrating the betrothal of N\xc3\xa9grel and C\xc3\xa9cile. Since the previous\r\nevening the Gr\xc3\xa9goires had had the dining-room waxed and the\r\ndrawing-room dusted. M\xc3\xa9lanie reigned in the kitchen, watching over the\r\nroasts and stirring the sauces, the odour of which ascended to the\r\nattics. It had been decided that Francis, the coachman, should help\r\nHonorine to wait. The gardener\'s wife would wash up, and the gardener\r\nwould open the gate. Never had the substantial, patriarchal old house\r\nbeen in such a state of gaiety.\r\n\r\nEverything went off beautifully, Madame Hennebeau was charming with\r\nC\xc3\xa9cile, and she smiled at N\xc3\xa9grel when the Montsou lawyer gallantly\r\nproposed the health of the future household. M. Hennebeau was also very\r\namiable. His smiling face struck the guests. The report circulated that\r\nhe was rising in favour with the directors, and that he would soon be\r\nmade an officer of the Legion of Honour, on account of the energetic\r\nmanner in which he had put down the strike. Nothing was said about\r\nrecent events; but there was an air of triumph in the general joy,\r\nand the dinner became the official celebration of a victory. At last,\r\nthen, they were saved, and once more they could begin to eat and sleep\r\nin peace. A discreet allusion was made to those dead whose blood the\r\nVoreux mud had yet scarcely drunk up. It was a necessary lesson: and\r\nthey were all affected when the Gr\xc3\xa9goires added that it was now the\r\nduty of all to go and heal the wounds in the settlements. They had\r\nregained their benevolent placidity, excusing their brave miners, whom\r\nthey could already see again at the bottom of the mines, giving a good\r\nexample of everlasting resignation. The Montsou notables, who had now\r\nleft off trembling, agreed that this question of the wage system ought\r\nto be studied, cautiously. The roasts came on; and the victory became\r\ncomplete when M. Hennebeau read a letter from the bishop announcing\r\nAbb\xc3\xa9 Ranvier\'s removal. The middle class throughout the province\r\nhad been roused to anger by the story of this priest who treated\r\nthe soldiers as murderers. And when the dessert appeared the lawyer\r\nresolutely declared that he was a free-thinker.\r\n\r\nDeneulin was there with his two daughters. In the midst of the joy, he\r\nforced himself to hide the melancholy of his ruin. That very morning he\r\nhad signed the sale of his Vandame concession to the Montsou Company.\r\nWith the knife at his throat he had submitted to the directors\'\r\ndemands, at last giving up to them that prey they had been on the\r\nwatch for so long, scarcely obtaining from them the money necessary\r\nto pay off his creditors. He had even accepted, as a lucky chance, at\r\nthe last moment, their offer to keep him as divisional engineer, thus\r\nresigning himself to watch, as a simple salaried servant, over that pit\r\nwhich had swallowed up his fortune. It was the knell of small personal\r\nenterprises, the approaching disappearance of the masters, eaten up,\r\none by one, by the ever-hungry ogre of capital, drowned in the rising\r\nflood of great companies. He alone paid the expenses of the strike;\r\nhe understood that they were drinking to his disaster when they drank\r\nto M. Hennebeau\'s rosette. And he only consoled himself a little when\r\nhe saw the fine courage of Lucie and Jeanne, who looked charming in\r\ntheir done-up toilettes, laughing at the downfall, like happy tomboys\r\ndisdainful of money.\r\n\r\nWhen they passed into the drawing-room for coffee, M. Gr\xc3\xa9goire drew his\r\ncousin aside and congratulated him on the courage of his decision.\r\n\r\n"What would you have? Your real mistake was to risk the million of your\r\nMontsou denier over Vandame. You gave yourself a terrible wound, and it\r\nhas melted away in that dog\'s labour, while mine, which has not stirred\r\nfrom my drawer, still keeps me comfortably doing nothing, as it will\r\nkeep my grandchildren\'s children."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Sunday \xc3\x89tienne escaped from the settlement at nightfall. A very\r\nclear sky, sprinkled with stars, lit up the earth with the blue haze\r\nof twilight. He went down towards the canal, and followed the bank\r\nslowly, in the direction of Marchiennes. It was his favourite walk,\r\na grass-covered path two leagues long, passing straight beside this\r\ngeometrical water-way, which unrolled itself like an endless ingot\r\nof molten silver. He never met any one there. But on this day he was\r\nvexed to see a man come up to him. Beneath the pale starlight, the two\r\nsolitary walkers only recognized each other when they were face to face.\r\n\r\n"What! is it you?" said \xc3\x89tienne.\r\n\r\nSouvarine nodded his head without replying. For a moment they remained\r\nmotionless, then side by side they set out towards Marchiennes. Each of\r\nthem seemed to be continuing his own reflections, as though they were\r\nfar away from each other.\r\n\r\n"Have you seen in the paper about Pluchart\'s success at Paris?" asked\r\n\xc3\x89tienne, at length. "After that meeting at Belleville, they waited for\r\nhim on the pavement, and gave him an ovation. Oh! he\'s afloat now, in\r\nspite of his sore throat. He can do what he likes in the future."\r\n\r\nThe engine-man shrugged his shoulders. He felt contempt for fine\r\ntalkers, fellows who go into politics as one goes to the bar, to get an\r\nincome out of phrases.\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne was now studying Darwin. He had read fragments, summarized\r\nand popularized in a five-sou volume; and out of this ill-understood\r\nreading he had gained for himself a revolutionary idea of the struggle\r\nfor existence, the lean eating the fat, the strong people devouring the\r\npallid middle class. But Souvarine furiously attacked the stupidity\r\nof the Socialists who accept Darwin, that apostle of scientific\r\ninequality, whose famous selection was only good for aristocratic\r\nphilosophers. His mate persisted, however, wishing to reason out the\r\nmatter, and expressing his doubts by an hypothesis: supposing the old\r\nsociety were no longer to exist, swept away to the crumbs; well, was\r\nit not to be feared that the new world would grow up again, slowly\r\nspoilt by the same injustices, some sick and others flourishing, some\r\nmore skilful and intelligent, fattening on everything, and others\r\nimbecile and lazy, becoming slaves again? But before this vision of\r\neternal wretchedness, the engine-man shouted out fiercely that if\r\njustice was not possible with man, then man must disappear. For every\r\nrotten society there must be a massacre, until the last creature was\r\nexterminated. And there was silence again.\r\n\r\nFor a long time, with sunken head, Souvarine walked over the short\r\ngrass, so absorbed that he kept to the extreme edge, by the water, with\r\nthe quiet certainty of a sleep-walker on a roof. Then he shuddered\r\ncauselessly, as though he had stumbled against a shadow. His eyes\r\nlifted and his face was very pale; he said softly to his companion:\r\n\r\n"Did I ever tell you how she died?"\r\n\r\n"Whom do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"My wife, over there, in Russia."\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne made a vague gesture, astonished at the tremor in his voice and\r\nat the sudden desire for confidence in this lad, who was usually so\r\nimpassive in his stoical detachment from others and from himself. He\r\nonly knew that the woman was his mistress, and that she had been hanged\r\nat Moscow.\r\n\r\n"The affair hadn\'t gone off," Souvarine said, with eyes still vacantly\r\nfollowing the white stream of the canal between the bluish colonnades\r\nof tall trees. "We had been a fortnight at the bottom of a hole\r\nundermining the railway, and it was not the imperial train that was\r\nblown up, it was a passenger train. Then they arrested Annutchka. She\r\nbrought us bread every evening, disguised as a peasant woman. She lit\r\nthe fuse, too, because a man might have attracted attention. I followed\r\nthe trial, hidden in the crowd, for six days."\r\n\r\nHis voice became thick, and he coughed as though he were choking.\r\n\r\n"Twice I wanted to cry out, and to rush over the people\'s heads to join\r\nher. But what was the good? One man less would be one soldier less; and\r\nI could see that she was telling me not to come, when her large eyes\r\nmet mine."\r\n\r\nHe coughed again.\r\n\r\n"On the last day in the square I was there. It was raining; they\r\nstupidly lost their heads, put out by the falling rain. It took twenty\r\nminutes to hang the other four; the cord broke, they could not finish\r\nthe fourth. Annutchka was standing up waiting. She could not see me,\r\nshe was looking for me in the crowd. I got on to a post and she saw me,\r\nand our eyes never turned from each other. When she was dead she was\r\nstill looking at me. I waved my hat; I came away."\r\n\r\nThere was silence again. The white road of the canal unrolled to the\r\nfar distance, and they both walked with the same quiet step as though\r\neach had fallen back into his isolation. At the horizon, the pale water\r\nseemed to open the sky with a little hole of light.\r\n\r\n"It was our punishment," Souvarine went on roughly. "We were guilty to\r\nlove each other. Yes, it is well that she is dead; heroes will be born\r\nfrom her blood, and I no longer have any cowardice at my heart. Ah!\r\nnothing, neither parents, nor wife, nor friend! Nothing to make my hand\r\ntremble on the day when I must take others\' lives or give up my own."\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne had stopped, shuddering in the cool night. He discussed no\r\nmore, he simply said:\r\n\r\n"We have gone far; shall we go back?"\r\n\r\nThey went back towards the Voreux slowly, and he added, after a few\r\npaces:\r\n\r\n"Have you seen the new placards?"\r\n\r\nThe Company had that morning put up some more large yellow posters.\r\nThey were clearer and more conciliatory, and the Company undertook\r\nto take back the certificates of those miners who went down on the\r\nfollowing day. Everything would be forgotten, and pardon was offered\r\neven to those who were most implicated.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I\'ve seen," replied the engine-man.\r\n\r\n"Well, what do you think of it?"\r\n\r\n"I think that it\'s all up. The flock will go down again. You are all\r\ntoo cowardly."\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne feverishly excused his mates: a man may be brave, a mob which\r\nis dying of hunger has no strength. Step by step they were returning to\r\nthe Voreux; and before the black mass of the pit he continued swearing\r\nthat he, at least, would never go down; but he could forgive those\r\nwho did. Then, as the rumour ran that the carpenters had not had time\r\nto repair the tubbing, he asked for information. Was it true? Had the\r\nweight of the soil against the timber which formed the internal skirt\r\nof scaffolding to the shaft so pushed it in that the winding-cages\r\nrubbed as they went down for a length of over fifty metres?\r\n\r\nSouvarine, who once more became uncommunicative, replied briefly. He\r\nhad been working the day before, and the cage did, in fact, jar; the\r\nengine-men had even had to double the speed to pass that spot. But all\r\nthe bosses received any observations with the same irritating remark:\r\nit was coal they wanted; that could be repaired later on.\r\n\r\n"You see that will smash up!" \xc3\x89tienne murmured. "It will be a fine\r\ntime!"\r\n\r\nWith eyes vaguely fixed on the pit in the shadow, Souvarine quietly\r\nconcluded:\r\n\r\n"If it does smash up, the mates will know it, since you advise them to\r\ngo down again."\r\n\r\nNine o\'clock struck at the Montsou steeple; and his companion having\r\nsaid that he was going to bed, he added, without putting out his hand:\r\n\r\n"Well, good-bye. I\'m going away."\r\n\r\n"What! you\'re going away?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I\'ve asked for my certificate back. I\'m going elsewhere."\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne, stupefied and affected, looked at him. After walking for two\r\nhours he said that to him! And in so calm a voice, while the mere\r\nannouncement of this sudden separation made his own heart ache. They\r\nhad got to know each other, they had toiled together; that always makes\r\none sad, the idea of not seeing a person again.\r\n\r\n"You\'re going away! And where do you go?"\r\n\r\n"Over there--I don\'t know at all."\r\n\r\n"But I shall see you again?"\r\n\r\n"No, I think not."\r\n\r\nThey were silent and remained for a moment facing each other without\r\nfinding anything to say.\r\n\r\n"Then good-bye."\r\n\r\n"Good-bye."\r\n\r\nWhile \xc3\x89tienne ascended toward the settlement, Souvarine turned and\r\nagain went along the canal bank; and there, now alone, he continued to\r\nwalk, with sunken head, so lost in the darkness that he seemed merely\r\na moving shadow of the night. Now and then he stopped, he counted the\r\nhours that struck afar. When he heard midnight strike he left the bank\r\nand turned towards the Voreux.\r\n\r\nAt that time the pit was empty, and he only met a sleepy-eyed captain.\r\nIt was not until two o\'clock that they would begin to get up steam to\r\nresume work. First he went to take from a cupboard a jacket which he\r\npretended to have forgotten. Various tools--a drill armed with its\r\nscrew, a small but very strong saw, a hammer, and a chisel--were rolled\r\nup in this jacket. Then he left. But instead of going out through the\r\nshed he passed through the narrow corridor which led to the ladder\r\npassage. With his jacket under his arm he quietly went down without a\r\nlamp, measuring the depth by counting the ladders. He knew that the\r\ncage jarred at three hundred and seventy-four metres against the fifth\r\nrow of the lower tubbing. When he had counted fifty-four ladders he\r\nput out his hand and was able to feel the swelling of the planking.\r\nIt was there. Then, with the skill and coolness of a good workman who\r\nhas been reflecting over his task for a long time, he set to work. He\r\nbegan by sawing a panel in the brattice so as to communicate with the\r\nwinding-shaft. With the help of matches, quickly lighted and blown out,\r\nhe was then able to ascertain the condition of the tubbing and of the\r\nrecent repairs.\r\n\r\nBetween Calais and Valenciennes the sinking of mine shafts was\r\nsurrounded by immense difficulties on account of the masses of\r\nsubterranean water in great sheets at the level of the lowest valleys.\r\nOnly the construction of tubbings, frameworks jointed like the stays\r\nof a barrel, could keep out the springs which flow in and isolate the\r\nshafts in the midst of the lakes, which with deep obscure waves beat\r\nagainst the walls. It had been necessary in sinking the Voreux to\r\nestablish two tubbings: that of the upper level, in the shifting sands\r\nand white clays bordering the chalky stratum, and fissured in every\r\npart, swollen with water like a sponge; then that of the lower level,\r\nimmediately above the coal stratum, in a yellow sand as fine as flour,\r\nflowing with liquid fluidity; it was here that the Torrent was to be\r\nfound, that subterranean sea so dreaded in the coal pits of the Nord,\r\na sea with its storms and its shipwrecks, an unknown and unfathomable\r\nsea, rolling its dark floods more than three hundred metres beneath the\r\ndaylight. Usually the tubbings resisted the enormous pressure; the only\r\nthing to be dreaded was the piling up of the neighbouring soil, shaken\r\nby the constant movement of the old galleries which were filling up.\r\nIn this descent of the rocks lines of fracture were sometimes produced\r\nwhich slowly extended as far as the scaffolding, at last perforating\r\nit and pushing it into the shaft; and there was the great danger of a\r\nlandslip and a flood filling the pit with an avalanche of earth and a\r\ndeluge of springs.\r\n\r\nSouvarine, sitting astride in the opening he had made, discovered a\r\nvery serious defect in the fifth row of tubbing. The wood was bellied\r\nout from the framework; several planks had even come out of their\r\nshoulder-pieces. Abundant filtrations, _pichoux_ the miners call\r\nthem, were jetting out of the joints through the tarred oakum with\r\nwhich they were caulked. The carpenters, pressed for time, had been\r\ncontent to place iron squares at the angles, so carelessly that not all\r\nthe screws were put in. A considerable movement was evidently going on\r\nbehind in the sand of the Torrent.\r\n\r\nThen with his wimble he unscrewed the squares so that another push\r\nwould tear them all off. It was a foolhardy task, during which he\r\nfrequently only just escaped from falling headlong down the hundred and\r\neighty metres which separated him from the bottom. He had been obliged\r\nto seize the oak guides, the joists along which the cages slid; and\r\nsuspended over the void he traversed the length of the cross-beams with\r\nwhich they were joined from point to point, slipping along, sitting\r\ndown, turning over, simply buttressing himself on an elbow or a knee,\r\nwith tranquil contempt of death. A breath would have sent him over,\r\nand three times he caught himself up without a shudder. First he felt\r\nwith his hand and then worked, only lighting a match when he lost\r\nhimself in the midst of these slimy beams. After loosening the screws\r\nhe attacked the wood itself, and the peril became still greater. He\r\nhad sought for the key, the piece which held the others; he attacked\r\nit furiously, making holes in it, sawing it, thinning it so that it\r\nlost its resistance; while through the holes and the cracks the water\r\nwhich escaped in small jets blinded him and soaked him in icy rain.\r\nTwo matches were extinguished. They all became damp and then there was\r\nnight, the bottomless depth of darkness.\r\n\r\nFrom this moment he was seized by rage. The breath of the invisible\r\nintoxicated him, the black horror of this rain-beaten hole urged him\r\nto mad destruction. He wreaked his fury at random against the tubbing,\r\nstriking where he could with his wimble, with his saw, seized by the\r\ndesire to bring the whole thing at once down on his head. He brought\r\nas much ferocity to the task as though he had been digging a knife\r\ninto the skin of some execrated living creature. He would kill the\r\nVoreux at last, that evil beast with ever-open jaws which had swallowed\r\nso much human flesh! The bite of his tools could be heard, his spine\r\nlengthened, he crawled, climbed down, then up again, holding on by a\r\nmiracle, in continual movement, the flight of a nocturnal bird amid the\r\nscaffolding of a belfry.\r\n\r\nBut he grew calm, dissatisfied with himself. Why could not things be\r\ndone coolly? Without haste he took breath, and then went back into\r\nthe ladder passage, stopping up the hole by replacing the panel which\r\nhe had sawn. That was enough; he did not wish to raise the alarm by\r\nexcessive damage which would have been repaired immediately. The beast\r\nwas wounded in the belly; we should see if it was still alive at night.\r\nAnd he had left his mark; the frightened world would know that the\r\nbeast had not died a natural death. He took his time in methodically\r\nrolling up his tools in his jacket, and slowly climbed up the ladders.\r\nThen, when he had emerged from the pit without being seen, it did not\r\neven occur to him to go and change his clothes. Three o\'clock struck.\r\nHe remained standing on the road waiting.\r\n\r\nAt the same hour \xc3\x89tienne, who was not asleep, was disturbed by a slight\r\nsound in the thick night of the room. He distinguished the low breath\r\nof the children, and the snoring of Bonnemort and Maheude; while\r\nJeanlin near him was breathing with a prolonged flute-like whistle.\r\nNo doubt he had dreamed, and he was turning back when the noise began\r\nagain. It was the creaking of a palliasse, the stifled effort of\r\nsomeone who is getting up. Then he imagined that Catherine must be ill.\r\n\r\n"I say, is it you? What is the matter?" he asked in a low voice.\r\n\r\nNo one replied, and the snoring of the others continued. For five\r\nminutes nothing stirred. Then there was fresh creaking. Feeling certain\r\nthis time that he was not mistaken, he crossed the room, putting his\r\nhands out into the darkness to feel the opposite bed. He was surprised\r\nto find the young girl sitting up, holding in her breath, awake and on\r\nthe watch.\r\n\r\n"Well! why don\'t you reply? What are you doing, then?"\r\n\r\nAt last she said:\r\n\r\n"I\'m getting up."\r\n\r\n"Getting up at this hour?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I\'m going back to work at the pit."\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne felt deeply moved, and sat down on the edge of the palliasse,\r\nwhile Catherine explained her reasons to him. She suffered too much by\r\nliving thus in idleness, feeling continual looks of reproach weighing\r\non her; she would rather run the risk of being knocked about down there\r\nby Chaval. And if her mother refused to take her money when she brought\r\nit, well! she was big enough to act for herself and make her own soup.\r\n\r\n"Go away; I want to dress. And don\'t say anything, will you, if you\r\nwant to be kind?"\r\n\r\nBut he remained near her; he had put his arms round her waist in a\r\ncaress of grief and pity. Pressed one against the other in their\r\nshirts, they could feel the warmth of each other\'s naked flesh, at\r\nthe edge of this bed, still moist with the night\'s sleep. She had at\r\nfirst tried to free herself; then she began to cry quietly, in her\r\nturn taking him by the neck to press him against her in a despairing\r\nclasp. And they remained, without any further desires, with the past of\r\ntheir unfortunate love, which they had not been able to satisfy. Was\r\nit, then, done with for ever? Would they never dare to love each other\r\nsome day, now that they were free? It only needed a little happiness\r\nto dissipate their shame--that awkwardness which prevented them from\r\ncoming together because of all sorts of ideas which they themselves\r\ncould not read clearly.\r\n\r\n"Go to bed again," she whispered. "I don\'t want to light up, it would\r\nwake mother. It is time; leave me."\r\n\r\nHe could not hear; he was pressing her wildly, with a heart drowned\r\nin immense sadness. The need for peace, an irresistible need for\r\nhappiness, was carrying him away; and he saw himself married, in a neat\r\nlittle house, with no other ambition than to live and to die there,\r\nboth of them together. He would be satisfied with bread; and if there\r\nwere only enough for one, she should have it. What was the good of\r\nanything else? Was there anything in life worth more?\r\n\r\nBut she was unfolding her naked arms.\r\n\r\n"Please, leave me."\r\n\r\nThen, in a sudden impulse, he said in her ear:\r\n\r\n"Wait, I\'m coming with you."\r\n\r\nAnd he was himself surprised at what he had said. He had sworn never\r\nto go down again; whence then came this sudden decision, arising from\r\nhis lips without thought of his, without even a moment\'s discussion?\r\nThere was now such calm within him, so complete a cure of his doubts,\r\nthat he persisted like a man saved by chance, who has at last found the\r\nonly harbour from his torment. So he refused to listen to her when she\r\nbecame alarmed, understanding that he was devoting himself for her and\r\nfearing the ill words which would greet him at the pit. He laughed at\r\neverything; the placards promised pardon and that was enough.\r\n\r\n"I want to work; that\'s my idea. Let us dress and make no noise."\r\n\r\nThey dressed themselves in the darkness, with a thousand precautions.\r\nShe had secretly prepared her miner\'s clothes the evening before; he\r\ntook a jacket and breeches from the cupboard; and they did not wash\r\nthemselves for fear of knocking the bowl. All were asleep, but they had\r\nto cross the narrow passage where the mother slept. When they started,\r\nas ill luck would have it, they stumbled against a chair. She woke and\r\nasked drowsily:\r\n\r\n"Eh! what is it?"\r\n\r\nCatherine had stopped, trembling, and violently pressing \xc3\x89tienne\'s hand.\r\n\r\n"It\'s me; don\'t trouble yourself," he said. "I feel stifled and am\r\ngoing outside to breathe a bit."\r\n\r\n"Very well."\r\n\r\nAnd Maheude fell asleep again. Catherine dared not stir. At last she\r\nwent down into the parlour and divided a slice of bread-and-butter\r\nwhich she had reserved from a loaf given by a Montsou lady. Then they\r\nsoftly closed the door and went away.\r\n\r\nSouvarine had remained standing near the Avantage, at the corner of the\r\nroad. For half an hour he had been looking at the colliers who were\r\nreturning to work in the darkness, passing by with the dull tramp of\r\na herd. He was counting them, as a butcher counts his beasts at the\r\nentrance to the slaughter-house, and he was surprised at their number;\r\neven his pessimism had not foreseen that the number of cowards would\r\nhave been so great. The stream continued to pass by, and he grew stiff,\r\nvery cold, with clenched teeth and bright eyes.\r\n\r\nBut he started. Among the men passing by, whose faces he could not\r\ndistinguish, he had just recognized one by his walk. He came forward\r\nand stopped him.\r\n\r\n"Where are you going to?"\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne, in surprise, instead of replying, stammered:\r\n\r\n"What! you\'ve not set out yet!"\r\n\r\nThen he confessed he was going back to the pit. No doubt he had sworn;\r\nonly it could not be called life to wait with folded arms for things\r\nwhich would perhaps happen in a hundred years; and, besides, reasons of\r\nhis own had decided him.\r\n\r\nSouvarine had listened to him, shuddering. He seized him by the\r\nshoulder, and pushed him towards the settlement.\r\n\r\n"Go home again; I want you to. Do you understand?"\r\n\r\nBut Catherine having approached, he recognized her also. \xc3\x89tienne\r\nprotested, declaring that he allowed no one to judge his conduct. And\r\nthe engine-man\'s eyes went from the young girl to her companion, while\r\nhe stepped back with a sudden, relinquishing movement. When there was a\r\nwoman in a man\'s heart, that man was done for; he might die. Perhaps he\r\nsaw again in a rapid vision his mistress hanging over there at Moscow,\r\nthat last link cut from his flesh, which had rendered him free of the\r\nlives of others and of his own life. He said simply:\r\n\r\n"Go."\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne, feeling awkward, was delaying, and trying to find some\r\nfriendly word, so as not to separate in this manner.\r\n\r\n"Then you\'re still going?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Well, give me your hand, old chap. A pleasant journey, and no ill\r\nfeeling."\r\n\r\nThe other stretched out an icy hand. Neither friend nor wife.\r\n\r\n"Good-bye for good this time."\r\n\r\n"Yes, good-bye."\r\n\r\nAnd Souvarine, standing motionless in the darkness, watched \xc3\x89tienne and\r\nCatherine entering the Voreux.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nAt four o\'clock the descent began. Dansaert, who was personally\r\ninstalled at the marker\'s office in the lamp cabin, wrote down the name\r\nof each worker who presented himself and had a lamp given to him. He\r\ntook them all, without remark, keeping to the promise of the placards.\r\nWhen, however, he noticed \xc3\x89tienne and Catherine at the wicket, he\r\nstarted and became very red, and was opening his mouth to refuse their\r\nnames; then, he contented himself with the triumph, and a jeer. Ah! ah!\r\nso the strong man was thrown? The Company was, then, in luck since the\r\nterrible Montsou wrestler had come back to it to ask for bread? \xc3\x89tienne\r\nsilently took his lamp and went towards the shaft with the putter.\r\n\r\nBut it was there, in the receiving-room, that Catherine feared the\r\nmates\' bad words. At the very entrance she recognized Chaval, in the\r\nmidst of some twenty miners, waiting till a cage was free. He came\r\nfuriously towards her, but the sight of \xc3\x89tienne stopped him. Then he\r\naffected to sneer with an offensive shrug of the shoulders.\r\n\r\nVery good! he didn\'t care a hang, since the other had come to occupy\r\nthe place that was still warm; good riddance! It only concerned the\r\ngentleman if he liked the leavings; and beneath the exhibition of this\r\ncontempt he was again seized by a tremor of jealousy, and his eyes\r\nflamed. For the rest, the mates did not stir, standing silent, with\r\neyes lowered. They contented themselves with casting a sidelong look\r\nat the new-comers; then, dejected and without anger, they again stared\r\nfixedly at the mouth of the shaft, with their lamps in their hands,\r\nshivering beneath their thin jackets, in the constant draughts of this\r\nlarge room. At last the cage was wedged on to the keeps, and they were\r\nordered to get in. Catherine and \xc3\x89tienne were squeezed in one tram,\r\nalready containing Pierron and two pikemen. Beside them, in the other\r\ntram, Chaval was loudly saying to Father Mouque that the directors had\r\nmade a mistake in not taking advantage of the opportunity to free the\r\npits of the blackguards who were corrupting them; but the old groom,\r\nwho had already fallen back into the dog-like resignation of his\r\nexistence, no longer grew angry over the death of his children, and\r\nsimply replied by a gesture of conciliation.\r\n\r\nThe cage freed itself and slipped down into the darkness. No one spoke.\r\nSuddenly, when they were in the middle third of the descent, there was\r\na terrible jarring. The iron creaked, and the men were thrown on to\r\neach other.\r\n\r\n"By God!" growled \xc3\x89tienne, "are they going to flatten us? We shall end\r\nby being left here for good, with their confounded tubbing. And they\r\ntalk about having repaired it!"\r\n\r\nThe cage had, however, cleared the obstacle. It was now descending\r\nbeneath so violent a rain, like a storm, that the workmen anxiously\r\nlistened to the pouring. A number of leaks must then have appeared in\r\nthe caulking of the joints.\r\n\r\nPierron, who had been working for several days, when asked about it did\r\nnot like to show his fear, which might be considered as an attack on\r\nthe management, so he only replied:\r\n\r\n"Oh, no danger! it\'s always like that. No doubt they\'ve not had time to\r\ncaulk the leaks."\r\n\r\nThe torrent was roaring over their heads, and they at last reached the\r\npit-eye beneath a veritable waterspout. Not one of the captains had\r\nthought of climbing up the ladders to investigate the matter. The pump\r\nwould be enough, the carpenters would examine the joints the following\r\nnight. The reorganization of work in the galleries gave considerable\r\ntrouble. Before allowing the pikemen to return to their hewing cells,\r\nthe engineer had decided that for the first five days all the men\r\nshould execute certain works of consolidation which were extremely\r\nurgent. Landslips were threatening everywhere; the passages had\r\nsuffered to such an extent that the timbering had to be repaired along\r\na length of several hundred metres. Gangs of ten men were therefore\r\nformed below, each beneath the control of a captain. Then they were set\r\nto work at the most damaged spots. When the descent was complete, it\r\nwas found that three hundred and twenty-two miners had gone down, about\r\nhalf of those who worked there when the pit was in full swing.\r\n\r\nChaval belonged to the same gang as Catherine and \xc3\x89tienne. This was\r\nnot by chance; he had at first hidden behind his mates, and had then\r\nforced the captain\'s hand. This gang went to the end of the north\r\ngallery, nearly three kilometres away, to clear out a landslip which\r\nwas stopping up a gallery in the Dix-Huit-Pouces seam. They attacked\r\nthe fallen rocks with shovel and pick. \xc3\x89tienne, Chaval, and five others\r\ncleared away the rubbish while Catherine, with two trammers, wheeled\r\nthe earth up to the upbrow. They seldom spoke, and the captain never\r\nleft them. The putter\'s two lovers, however, were on the point of\r\ncoming to blows. While growling that he had had enough of this trollop,\r\nChaval was still thinking of her, and slyly hustling her about, so that\r\n\xc3\x89tienne had threatened to settle him if he did not leave her alone.\r\nThey eyed each other fiercely, and had to be separated.\r\n\r\nTowards eight o\'clock Dansaert passed to give a glance at the work. He\r\nappeared to be in a very bad humour, and was furious with the captain;\r\nnothing had gone well, what was the meaning of such work, the planking\r\nwould everywhere have to be done over again! And he went away declaring\r\nthat he would come back with the engineer. He had been waiting for\r\nN\xc3\xa9grel since morning, and could not understand the cause of this delay.\r\n\r\nAnother hour passed by. The captain had stopped the removal of the\r\nrubbish to employ all his people in supporting the roof. Even the\r\nputter and the two trammers left off wheeling to prepare and bring\r\npieces of timber. At this end of the gallery the gang formed a sort\r\nof advance guard at the very extremity of the mine, now without\r\ncommunication with the other stalls. Three or four times strange\r\nnoises, distant rushes, made the workers turn their heads to listen.\r\nWhat was it, then? One would have said that the passages were being\r\nemptied and the mates already returning at a running pace. But the\r\nsound was lost in the deep silence, and they set to wedging their wood\r\nagain, dazed by the loud blows of the hammer. At last they returned to\r\nthe rubbish, and the wheeling began once more. Catherine came back from\r\nher first journey in terror, saying that no one was to be found at the\r\nupbrow.\r\n\r\n"I called, but there was no reply. They\'ve all cleared out of the\r\nplace."\r\n\r\nThe bewilderment was so great that the ten men threw down their tools\r\nto rush away. The idea that they were abandoned, left alone at the\r\nbottom of the mine, so far from the pit-eye, drove them wild. They only\r\nkept their lamps and ran in single file--the men, the boys, the putter;\r\nthe captain himself lost his head and shouted out appeals, more and\r\nmore frightened at the silence in this endless desert of galleries.\r\nWhat then had happened that they did not meet a soul? What accident\r\ncould thus have driven away their mates? Their terror was increased\r\nby the uncertainty of the danger, this threat which they felt there\r\nwithout knowing what it was.\r\n\r\nWhen they at last came near the pit-eye, a torrent barred their road.\r\nThey were at once in water to the knees, and were no longer able to\r\nrun, laboriously fording the flood with the thought that one minute\'s\r\ndelay might mean death.\r\n\r\n"By God! it\'s the tubbing that\'s given way," cried \xc3\x89tienne. "I said we\r\nshould be left here for good."\r\n\r\nSince the descent Pierron had anxiously observed the increase of the\r\ndeluge which fell from the shaft. As with two others he loaded the\r\ntrams he raised his head, his face covered with large drops, and his\r\nears ringing with the roar of the tempest above. But he trembled\r\nespecially when he noticed that the sump beneath him, that pit ten\r\nmetres deep, was filling; the water was already spurting through the\r\nfloor and covering the metal plates. This showed that the pump was\r\nno longer sufficient to fight against the leaks. He heard it panting\r\nwith the groan of fatigue. Then he warned Dansaert, who swore angrily,\r\nreplying that they must wait for the engineer. Twice he returned to the\r\ncharge without extracting anything else but exasperated shrugs of the\r\nshoulder. Well! the water was rising; what could he do?\r\n\r\nMouque appeared with Bataille, whom he was leading to work, and he had\r\nto hold him with both hands, for the sleepy old horse had suddenly\r\nreared up, and, with a shrill neigh, was stretching his head towards\r\nthe shaft.\r\n\r\n"Well, philosopher, what troubles you? Ah! it\'s because it rains. Come\r\nalong, that doesn\'t concern you."\r\n\r\nBut the beast quivered all over his skin, and Mouque forcibly drew him\r\nto the haulage gallery.\r\n\r\nAlmost at the same moment as Mouque and Bataille were disappearing at\r\nthe end of a gallery, there was a crackling in the air, followed by\r\nthe prolonged noise of a fall. It was a piece of tubbing which had got\r\nloose and was falling a hundred and eighty metres down, rebounding\r\nagainst the walls. Pierron and the other porters were able to get\r\nout of the way, and the oak plank only smashed an empty tram. At\r\nthe same time, a mass of water, the leaping flood of a broken dyke,\r\nrushed down. Dansaert proposed to go up and examine; but, while he was\r\nstill speaking, another piece rolled down. And in terror before the\r\nthreatening catastrophe, he no longer hesitated, but gave the order to\r\ngo up, sending captains to warn the men in their stalls.\r\n\r\nThen a terrible hustling began. From every gallery rows of workers\r\ncame rushing up, trying to take the cages by assault. They crushed\r\nmadly against each other in order to be taken up at once. Some who had\r\nthought of trying the ladder passage came down again shouting that it\r\nwas already stopped up. That was the terror they all felt each time\r\nthat the cage rose; this time it was able to pass, but who knew if it\r\nwould be able to pass again in the midst of the obstacles obstructing\r\nthe shaft? The downfall must be continuing above, for a series of low\r\ndetonations was heard, the planks were splitting and bursting amid\r\nthe continuous and increasing roar of a storm. One cage soon became\r\nuseless, broken in and no longer sliding between the guides, which\r\nwere doubtless broken. The other jarred to such a degree that the\r\ncable would certainly break soon. And there remained a hundred men\r\nto be taken up, all panting, clinging to one another, bleeding and\r\nhalf-drowned. Two were killed by falls of planking. A third, who had\r\nseized the cage, fell back fifty metres up and disappeared in the sump.\r\n\r\nDansaert, however, was trying to arrange matters in an orderly manner.\r\nArmed with a pick he threatened to open the skull of the first man who\r\nrefused to obey; and he tried to arrange them in file, shouting that\r\nthe porters were to go up last after having sent up their mates. He was\r\nnot listened to, and he had to prevent the pale and cowardly Pierron\r\nfrom entering among the first. At each departure he pushed him aside\r\nwith a blow. But his own teeth were chattering, a minute more and he\r\nwould be swallowed up; everything was smashing up there, a flood had\r\nbroken loose, a murderous rain of scaffolding. A few men were still\r\nrunning up when, mad with fear, he jumped into a tram, allowing Pierron\r\nto jump in behind him. The cage rose.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the gang to which \xc3\x89tienne and Chaval belonged had just\r\nreached the pit-eye. They saw the cage disappear and rushed forward,\r\nbut they had to draw back from the final downfall of the tubbing; the\r\nshaft was stopped up and the cage would not come down again. Catherine\r\nwas sobbing, and Chaval was choked with shouting oaths. There were\r\ntwenty of them; were those bloody bosses going to abandon them thus?\r\nFather Mouque, who had brought back Bataille without hurrying, was\r\nstill holding him by the bridle, both of them stupefied, the man and\r\nthe beast, in the face of this rapid flow of the inundation. The water\r\nwas already rising to their thighs. \xc3\x89tienne in silence, with clenched\r\nteeth, supported Catherine between his arms. And the twenty yelled with\r\ntheir faces turned up, obstinately gazing at the shaft like imbeciles,\r\nthat shifting hole which was belching out a flood and from which no\r\nhelp could henceforth come to them.\r\n\r\nAt the surface, Dansaert, on arriving, perceived N\xc3\xa9grel running up. By\r\nsome fatality, Madame Hennebeau had that morning delayed him on rising,\r\nturning over the leaves of catalogues for the purchase of wedding\r\npresents. It was ten o\'clock.\r\n\r\n"Well! what\'s happening, then?" he shouted from afar.\r\n\r\n"The pit is ruined," replied the head captain.\r\n\r\nAnd he described the catastrophe in a few stammered words, while the\r\nengineer incredulously shrugged his shoulders. What! could tubbing\r\nbe demolished like that? They were exaggerating; he would make an\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\n"I suppose no one has been left at the bottom?"\r\n\r\nDansaert was confused. No, no one; at least, so he hoped. But some of\r\nthe men might have been delayed.\r\n\r\n"But," said N\xc3\xa9grel, "what in the name of creation have you come up for,\r\nthen? You can\'t leave your men!"\r\n\r\nHe immediately gave orders to count the lamps. In the morning three\r\nhundred and twenty-two had been distributed, and now only two hundred\r\nand fifty-five could be found; but several men acknowledged that in\r\nthe hustling and panic they had dropped theirs and left them behind.\r\nAn attempt was made to call over the men, but it was impossible to\r\nestablish the exact number. Some of the miners had gone away, others\r\ndid not hear their names. No one was agreed as to the number of the\r\nmissing mates. It might be twenty, perhaps forty. And the engineer\r\ncould only make out one thing with certainty: there were men down\r\nbelow, for their yells could be distinguished through the sound of the\r\nwater and the fallen scaffolding, on leaning over the mouth of the\r\nshaft.\r\n\r\nN\xc3\xa9grel\'s first care was to send for M. Hennebeau, and to try to close\r\nthe pit; but it was already too late. The colliers who had rushed to\r\nthe Deux-Cent-Quarante settlement, as though pursued by the cracking\r\ntubbing, had frightened the families; and bands of women, old men, and\r\nlittle ones came running up, shaken by cries and sobs. They had to be\r\npushed back, and a line of overseers was formed to keep them off, for\r\nthey would have interfered with the operations. Many of the men who\r\nhad come up from the shaft remained there stupidly without thinking\r\nof changing their clothes, riveted by fear before this terrible hole\r\nin which they had nearly remained for ever. The women, rushing wildly\r\naround them, implored them for names. Was So-and-so among them? and\r\nthat one? and this one? They did not know, they stammered; they\r\nshuddered terribly, and made gestures like madmen, gestures which\r\nseemed to be pushing away some abominable vision which was always\r\npresent to them. The crowd rapidly increased, and lamentations arose\r\nfrom the roads. And up there on the pit-bank, in Bonnemort\'s cabin, on\r\nthe ground was seated a man, Souvarine, who had not gone away, who was\r\nlooking on.\r\n\r\n"The names! the names!" cried the women, with voices choked by tears.\r\n\r\nN\xc3\xa9grel appeared for a moment, and said hurriedly:\r\n\r\n"As soon as we know the names they shall be given out, but nothing is\r\nlost so far: every one will be saved. I am going down."\r\n\r\nThen, silent with anguish, the crowd waited. The engineer, in fact,\r\nwith quiet courage was preparing to go down. He had had the cage\r\nunfastened, giving orders to replace it at the end of the cable by a\r\ntub; and as he feared that the water would extinguish his lamp, he had\r\nanother fastened beneath the tub, which would protect it.\r\n\r\nSeveral captains, trembling and with white, disturbed faces, assisted\r\nin these preparations.\r\n\r\n"You will come with me, Dansaert," said N\xc3\xa9grel, abruptly.\r\n\r\nThen, when he saw them all without courage, and that the head captain\r\nwas tottering, giddy with terror, he pushed him aside with a movement\r\nof contempt.\r\n\r\n"No, you will be in my way. I would rather go alone."\r\n\r\nHe was already in the narrow bucket, which swayed at the end of the\r\ncable; and holding his lamp in one hand and the signal-cord in the\r\nother, he shouted to the engine-man:\r\n\r\n"Gently!"\r\n\r\nThe engine set the drums in movement, and N\xc3\xa9grel disappeared in the\r\ngulf, from which the yells of the wretches below still arose.\r\n\r\nAt the upper part nothing had moved. He found that the tubbing here\r\nwas in good condition. Balanced in the middle of the shaft he lighted\r\nup the walls as he turned round; the leaks between the joints were\r\nso slight that his lamp did not suffer. But at three hundred metres,\r\nwhen he reached the lower tubbing, the lamp was extinguished, as he\r\nexpected, for a jet had filled the tub. After that he was only able\r\nto see by the hanging lamp which preceded him in the darkness, and,\r\nin spite of his courage, he shuddered and turned pale in the face of\r\nthe horror of the disaster. A few pieces of timber alone remained;\r\nthe others had fallen in with their frames. Behind, enormous cavities\r\nhad been hollowed out, and the yellow sand, as fine as flour, was\r\nflowing in considerable masses; while the waters of the Torrent,\r\nthat subterranean sea with its unknown tempests and shipwrecks, were\r\ndischarging in a flow like a weir. He went down lower, lost in the\r\nmidst of these chasms which continued to multiply, beaten and turned\r\nround by the waterspout of the springs, so badly lighted by the red\r\nstar of the lamp moving on below, that he seemed to distinguish the\r\nroads and squares of some destroyed town far away in the play of the\r\ngreat moving shadows. No human work was any longer possible. His only\r\nremaining hope was to attempt to save the men in peril. As he sank down\r\nhe heard the cries becoming louder, and he was obliged to stop; an\r\nimpassable obstacle barred the shaft--a mass of scaffolding, the broken\r\njoists of the guides, the split brattices entangled with the metal-work\r\ntorn from the pump. As he looked on for a long time with aching heart,\r\nthe yelling suddenly ceased. No doubt, the rapid rise of the water had\r\nforced the wretches to flee into the galleries, if, indeed, the flood\r\nhad not already filled their mouths.\r\n\r\nN\xc3\xa9grel resigned himself to pulling the signal-cord as a sign to\r\ndraw up. Then he had himself stopped again. He could not conceive\r\nthe cause of this sudden accident. He wished to investigate it, and\r\nexamined those pieces of the tubbing which were still in place. At a\r\ndistance the tears and cuts in the wood had surprised him. His lamp,\r\ndrowned in dampness, was going out, and, touching with his fingers, he\r\nclearly recognized the marks of the saw and of the wimble--the whole\r\nabominable labour of destruction. Evidently this catastrophe had been\r\nintentionally produced. He was stupefied, and the pieces of timber,\r\ncracking and falling down with their frames in a last slide, nearly\r\ncarried him with them. His courage fled. The thought of the man who had\r\ndone that made his hair stand on end, and froze him with a supernatural\r\nfear of evil, as though, mixed with the darkness, the men were still\r\nthere paying for his immeasurable crime. He shouted and shook the cord\r\nfuriously; and it was, indeed, time, for he perceived that the upper\r\ntubbing, a hundred metres higher, was in its turn beginning to move.\r\nThe joints were opening, losing their oakum caulking, and streams were\r\nrushing through. It was now only a question of hours before the tubbing\r\nwould all fall down.\r\n\r\nAt the surface M. Hennebeau was anxiously waiting for N\xc3\xa9grel.\r\n\r\n"Well, what?" he asked.\r\n\r\nBut the engineer was choked, and could not speak; he felt faint.\r\n\r\n"It is not possible; such a thing was never seen. Have you examined?"\r\n\r\nHe nodded with a cautious look. He refused to talk in the presence of\r\nsome captains who were listening, and led his uncle ten metres away,\r\nand not thinking this far enough, drew still farther back; then, in a\r\nlow whisper, he at last told of the outrage, the torn and sawn planks,\r\nthe pit bleeding at the neck and groaning. Turning pale, the manager\r\nalso lowered his voice, with that instinctive need of silence in face\r\nof the monstrosity of great orgies and great crimes. It was useless to\r\nlook as though they were trembling before the ten thousand Montsou men;\r\nlater on they would see. And they both continued whispering, overcome\r\nat the thought that a man had had the courage to go down, to hang in\r\nthe midst of space, to risk his life twenty times over in his terrible\r\ntask. They could not even understand this mad courage in destruction;\r\nthey refused to believe, in spite of the evidence, just as we doubt\r\nthose stories of celebrated escapes of prisoners who fly through\r\nwindows thirty metres above the ground.\r\n\r\nWhen M. Hennebeau came back to the captains a nervous spasm was drawing\r\nhis face. He made a gesture of despair, and gave orders that the mine\r\nshould be evacuated at once. It was a kind of funeral procession, in\r\nsilent abandonment, with glances thrown back at those great masses of\r\nbricks, empty and still standing, but which nothing henceforth could\r\nsave.\r\n\r\nAnd as the manager and the engineer came down last from the\r\nreceiving-room, the crowd met them with its clamour, repeating\r\nobstinately:\r\n\r\n"The names! the names! Tell us the names!"\r\n\r\nMaheude was now there, among the women. She recollected the noise in\r\nthe night; her daughter and the lodger must have gone away together,\r\nand they were certainly down at the bottom. And after having cried that\r\nit was a good thing, that they deserved to stay there, the heartless\r\ncowards, she had run up, and was standing in the first row, trembling\r\nwith anguish. Besides, she no longer dared to doubt; the discussion\r\ngoing on around her informed her as to the names of those who were\r\ndown. Yes, yes, Catherine was among them, \xc3\x89tienne also--a mate had seen\r\nthem. But there was not always agreement with regard to the others.\r\nNo, not this one; on the contrary, that one, perhaps Chaval, with\r\nwhom, however, a trammer declared that he had ascended. The Levaque\r\nand Pierronne, although none of their people were in danger, cried out\r\nand lamented as loudly as the others. Zacharie, who had come up among\r\nthe first, in spite of his inclination to make fun of everything had\r\nweepingly kissed his wife and mother, and remained near the latter,\r\nquivering, and showing an unexpected degree of affection for his\r\nsister, refusing to believe that she was below so long as the bosses\r\nmade no authoritative statement.\r\n\r\n"The names! the names! For pity\'s sake, the names!"\r\n\r\nN\xc3\xa9grel, who was exhausted, shouted to the overseers:\r\n\r\n"Can\'t you make them be still? It\'s enough to kill one with vexation!\r\nWe don\'t know the names!"\r\n\r\nTwo hours passed away in this manner. In the first terror no one had\r\nthought of the other shaft at the old R\xc3\xa9quillart mine, M. Hennebeau was\r\nabout to announce that the rescue would be attempted from that side,\r\nwhen a rumour ran round: five men had just escaped the inundation by\r\nclimbing up the rotten ladders of the old unused passage, and Father\r\nMouque was named. This caused surprise, for no one knew he was below.\r\nBut the narrative of the five who had escaped increased the weeping;\r\nfifteen mates had not been able to follow them, having gone astray, and\r\nbeen walled up by falls. And it was no longer possible to assist them,\r\nfor there were already ten metres of water in R\xc3\xa9quillart. All the names\r\nwere known, and the air was filled with the groans of a slaughtered\r\nmultitude.\r\n\r\n"Will you make them be still?" N\xc3\xa9grel repeated furiously. "Make them\r\ndraw back! Yes, yes, to a hundred metres! There is danger; push them\r\nback, push them back!"\r\n\r\nIt was necessary to struggle against these poor people. They were\r\nimagining all sorts of misfortunes, and they had to be driven away so\r\nthat the deaths might be concealed; the captains explained to them that\r\nthe shaft would destroy the whole mine. This idea rendered them mute\r\nwith terror, and they at last allowed themselves to be driven back step\r\nby step; the guards, however, who kept them back had to be doubled, for\r\nthey were fascinated by the spot and continually returned. Thousands of\r\npeople were hustling each other along the road; they were running up\r\nfrom all the settlements, and even from Montsou. And the man above, on\r\nthe pit-bank, the fair man with the girlish face, smoked cigarettes to\r\noccupy himself, keeping his clear eyes fixed on the pit.\r\n\r\nThen the wait began. It was midday; no one had eaten, but no one moved\r\naway. In the misty sky, of a dirty grey colour, rusty clouds were\r\nslowly passing by. A big dog, behind Rasseneur\'s hedge, was barking\r\nfuriously without cessation, irritated by the living breath of the\r\ncrowd. And the crowd had gradually spread over the neighbouring ground,\r\nforming a circle at a hundred metres round the pit. The Voreux arose in\r\nthe centre of the great space. There was not a soul there, not a sound;\r\nit was a desert. The windows and the doors, left open, showed the\r\nabandonment within; a forgotten ginger cat, divining the peril in this\r\nsolitude, jumped from a staircase and disappeared. No doubt the stoves\r\nof the boilers were scarcely extinguished, for the tall brick chimney\r\ngave out a light smoke beneath the dark clouds; while the weathercock\r\non the steeple creaked in the wind with a short, shrill cry, the only\r\nmelancholy voice of these vast buildings which were about to die.\r\n\r\nAt two o\'clock nothing had moved, M. Hennebeau, N\xc3\xa9grel, and other\r\nengineers who had hastened up, formed a group in black coats and hats\r\nstanding in front of the crowd; and they, too, did not move away,\r\nthough their legs were aching with fatigue, and they were feverish and\r\nill at their impotence in the face of such a disaster, only whispering\r\noccasional words as though at a dying person\'s bedside. The upper\r\ntubbing must nearly all have fallen in, for sudden echoing sounds could\r\nbe heard as of deep broken falls, succeeded by silence. The wound was\r\nconstantly enlarging; the landslip which had begun below was rising\r\nand approaching the surface. N\xc3\xa9grel was seized by nervous impatience;\r\nhe wanted to see, and he was already advancing alone into this awful\r\nvoid when he was seized by the shoulders. What was the good? he could\r\nprevent nothing. An old miner, however, circumventing the overseers,\r\nrushed into the shed; but he quietly reappeared, he had gone for his\r\nsabots.\r\n\r\nThree o\'clock struck. Still nothing. A falling shower had soaked the\r\ncrowd, but they had not withdrawn a step. Rasseneur\'s dog had begun\r\nto bark again. And it was at twenty minutes past three only that the\r\nfirst shock was felt. The Voreux trembled, but continued solid and\r\nupright. Then a second shock followed immediately, and a long cry came\r\nfrom open mouths; the tarred screening-shed, after having tottered\r\ntwice, had fallen down with a terrible crash. Beneath the enormous\r\npressure the structures broke and jarred each other so powerfully that\r\nsparks leapt out. From this moment the earth continued to tremble, the\r\nshocks succeeded one another, subterranean downfalls, the rumbling of a\r\nvolcano in eruption. Afar the dog was no longer barking, but he howled\r\nplaintively as though announcing the oscillations which he felt coming;\r\nand the women, the children, all these people who were looking on,\r\ncould not keep back a clamour of distress at each of these blows which\r\nshook them. In less than ten minutes the slate roof of the steeple fell\r\nin, the receiving-room and the engine-rooms were split open, leaving a\r\nconsiderable breach. Then the sounds ceased, the downfall stopped, and\r\nthere was again deep silence.\r\n\r\nFor an hour the Voreux remained thus, broken into, as though bombarded\r\nby an army of barbarians. There was no more crying out; the enlarged\r\ncircle of spectators merely looked on. Beneath the piled-up beams of\r\nthe sifting-shed, fractured tipping cradles could be made out with\r\nbroken and twisted hoppers. But the rubbish had especially accumulated\r\nat the receiving-room, where there had been a rain of bricks, and large\r\nportions of wall and masses of plaster had fallen in. The iron scaffold\r\nwhich bore the pulleys had bent, half-buried in the pit; a cage was\r\nstill suspended, a torn cable-end was hanging; then there was a hash\r\nof trams, metal plates, and ladders. By some chance the lamp cabin\r\nremained standing, exhibiting on the left its bright rows of little\r\nlamps. And at the end of its disembowelled chamber, the engine could be\r\nseen seated squarely on its massive foundation of masonry; its copper\r\nwas shining and its huge steel limbs seemed to possess indestructible\r\nmuscles. The enormous crank, bent in the air, looked like the powerful\r\nknee of some giant quietly reposing in his strength.\r\n\r\nAfter this hour of respite, M. Hennebeau\'s hopes began to rise. The\r\nmovement of the soil must have come to an end, and there would be\r\nsome chance of saving the engine and the remainder of the buildings.\r\nBut he would not yet allow any one to approach, considering another\r\nhalf-hour\'s patience desirable. This waiting became unbearable; the\r\nhope increased the anguish and all hearts were beating quickly. A dark\r\ncloud, growing large at the horizon, hastened the twilight, a sinister\r\ndayfall over this wreck of earth\'s tempests. Since seven o\'clock they\r\nhad been there without moving or eating.\r\n\r\nAnd suddenly, as the engineers were cautiously advancing, a supreme\r\nconvulsion of the soil put them to flight. Subterranean detonations\r\nbroke out; a whole monstrous artillery was cannonading in the gulf. At\r\nthe surface, the last buildings were tipped over and crushed. At first\r\na sort of whirlpool carried away the rubbish from the sifting-shed and\r\nthe receiving-room. Next, the boiler building burst and disappeared.\r\nThen it was the low square tower, where the pumping-engine was\r\ngroaning, which fell on its face like a man mown down by a bullet.\r\nAnd then a terrible thing was seen; the engine, dislocated from its\r\nmassive foundation, with broken limbs was struggling against death; it\r\nmoved, it straightened its crank, its giant\'s knee, as though to rise;\r\nbut, crushed and swallowed up, it was dying. The chimney alone, thirty\r\nmetres high, still remained standing, though shaken, like a mast in the\r\ntempest. It was thought that it would be crushed to fragments and fly\r\nto powder, when suddenly it sank in one block, drunk down by the earth,\r\nmelted like a colossal candle; and nothing was left, not even the point\r\nof the lightning conductor. It was done for; the evil beast crouching\r\nin this hole, gorged with human flesh, was no longer breathing with its\r\nthick, long respiration. The Voreux had been swallowed whole by the\r\nabyss.\r\n\r\nThe crowd rushed away yelling. The women hid their eyes as they ran.\r\nTerror drove the men along like a pile of dry leaves. They wished not\r\nto shout and they shouted, with swollen breasts, and arms in the air,\r\nbefore the immense hole which had been hollowed out. This crater, as\r\nof an extinct volcano, fifteen metres deep, extended from the road\r\nto the canal for a space of at least forty metres. The whole square\r\nof the mine had followed the buildings, the gigantic platforms, the\r\nfoot-bridges with their rails, a complete train of trams, three wagons;\r\nwithout counting the wood supply, a forest of cut timber, gulped\r\ndown like straw. At the bottom it was only possible to distinguish a\r\nconfused mass of beams, bricks, iron, plaster, frightful remains, piled\r\nup, entangled, soiled in the fury of the catastrophe. And the hole\r\nbecame larger, cracks started from the edges, reaching afar, across the\r\nfields. A fissure ascended as far as Rasseneur\'s bar, and his front\r\nwall had cracked. Would the settlement itself pass into it? How far\r\nought they to flee to reach shelter at the end of this abominable day,\r\nbeneath this leaden cloud which also seemed about to crush the earth?\r\n\r\nA cry of pain escaped N\xc3\xa9grel. M. Hennebeau, who had drawn back, was\r\nin tears. The disaster was not complete; one bank of the canal gave\r\nway, and the canal emptied itself like one bubbling sheet through one\r\nof the cracks. It disappeared there, falling like a cataract down a\r\ndeep valley. The mine drank down this river; the galleries would now\r\nbe submerged for years. Soon the crater was filled and a lake of muddy\r\nwater occupied the place where once stood the Voreux, like one of\r\nthose lakes beneath which sleep accursed towns. There was a terrified\r\nsilence, and nothing now could be heard but the fall of this water\r\nrumbling in the bowels of the earth.\r\n\r\nThen on the shaken pit-bank Souvarine rose up. He had recognized\r\nMaheude and Zacharie sobbing before this downfall, the weight of which\r\nwas so heavy on the heads of the wretches who were in agony beneath.\r\nAnd he threw down his last cigarette; he went away, without looking\r\nback, into the now dark night. Afar his shadow diminished and mingled\r\nwith the darkness. He was going over there, to the unknown. He was\r\ngoing tranquilly to extermination, wherever there might be dynamite\r\nto blow up towns and men. He will be there, without doubt, when the\r\nmiddle class in agony shall hear the pavement of the streets bursting\r\nup beneath their feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the night that followed the collapse of the Voreux M. Hennebeau\r\nstarted for Paris, wishing to inform the directors in person before the\r\nnewspapers published the news. And when he returned on the following\r\nday he appeared to be quite calm, with his usual correct administrative\r\nair. He had evidently freed himself from responsibility; he did not\r\nappear to have decreased in favour. On the contrary, the decree\r\nappointing him officer of the Legion of Honour was signed twenty-four\r\nhours afterwards.\r\n\r\nBut if the manager remained safe, the Company was tottering beneath the\r\nterrible blow. It was not the few million francs that had been lost,\r\nit was the wound in the flank, the deep incessant fear of the morrow\r\nin face of this massacre of one of their mines. The Company was so\r\nimpressed that once more it felt the need of silence. What was the good\r\nof stirring up this abomination? If the villain were discovered, why\r\nmake a martyr of him in order that his awful heroism might turn other\r\nheads, and give birth to a long line of incendiaries and murderers?\r\nBesides, the real culprit was not suspected. The Company came to think\r\nthat there was an army of accomplices, not being able to believe that\r\na single man could have had courage and strength for such a task; and\r\nit was precisely this thought which weighed on them, this thought of\r\nan ever-increasing threat to the existence of their mines. The manager\r\nhad received orders to organize a vast system of espionage, and then\r\nto dismiss quietly, one by one, the dangerous men who were suspected\r\nof having had a hand in the crime. They contented themselves with this\r\nmethod of purification--a prudent and politic method.\r\n\r\nThere was only one immediate dismissal, that of Dansaert, the head\r\ncaptain. Ever since the scandal at Pierronne\'s house he had become\r\nimpossible. A pretext was made of his attitude in danger, the cowardice\r\nof a captain abandoning his men. This was also a prudent sop thrown to\r\nthe miners, who hated him.\r\n\r\nAmong the public, however, many rumours had circulated, and the\r\ndirectors had to send a letter of correction to one newspaper,\r\ncontradicting a story in which mention was made of a barrel of powder\r\nlighted by the strikers. After a rapid inquiry the Government inspector\r\nhad concluded that there had been a natural rupture of the tubbing,\r\noccasioned by the piling up of the soil; and the Company had preferred\r\nto be silent, and to accept the blame of a lack of superintendence. In\r\nthe Paris press, after the third day, the catastrophe had served to\r\nincrease the stock of general news; nothing was talked of but the men\r\nperishing at the bottom of the mine, and the telegrams published every\r\nmorning were eagerly read. At Montsou people grew pale and speechless\r\nat the very name of the Voreux, and a legend had formed which made the\r\nboldest tremble as they whispered it. The whole country showed great\r\npity for the victims; visits were organized to the destroyed pit, and\r\nwhole families hastened up to shudder at the ruins which lay so heavily\r\nover the heads of the buried wretches.\r\n\r\nDeneulin, who had been appointed divisional engineer, came into the\r\nmidst of the disaster on beginning his duties; and his first care was\r\nto turn the canal back into its bed, for this torrent increased the\r\ndamage every hour. Extensive works were necessary, and he at once\r\nset a hundred men to construct a dyke. Twice over the impetuosity of\r\nthe stream carried away the first dams. Now pumps were set up and a\r\nfurious struggle was going on; step by step the vanished soil was being\r\nviolently reconquered.\r\n\r\nBut the rescue of the engulfed miners was a still more absorbing work.\r\nN\xc3\xa9grel was appointed to attempt a supreme effort, and arms were not\r\nlacking to help him; all the colliers rushed to offer themselves in an\r\noutburst of brotherhood. They forgot the strike, they did not trouble\r\nthemselves at all about payment; they might get nothing, they only\r\nasked to risk their lives as soon as there were mates in danger of\r\ndeath. They were all there with their tools, quivering as they waited\r\nto know where they ought to strike. Many of them, sick with fright\r\nafter the accident, shaken by nervous tremors, soaked in cold sweats,\r\nand the prey of continual nightmares, got up in spite of everything,\r\nand were as eager as any in their desire to fight against the earth, as\r\nthough they had a revenge to take on it. Unfortunately, the difficulty\r\nbegan when the question arose, What could be done? how could they go\r\ndown? from what side could they attack the rocks?\r\n\r\nN\xc3\xa9grel\'s opinion was that not one of the unfortunate people was alive;\r\nthe fifteen had surely perished, drowned or suffocated. But in these\r\nmine catastrophes the rule is always to assume that buried men are\r\nalive, and he acted on this supposition. The first problem which he\r\nproposed to himself was to decide where they could have taken refuge.\r\nThe captains and old miners whom he consulted were agreed on one\r\npoint: in the face of the rising water the men had certainly come up\r\nfrom gallery to gallery to the highest cuttings, so that they were,\r\nwithout doubt, driven to the end of some upper passages. This agreed\r\nwith Father Mouque\'s information, and his confused narrative even\r\ngave reason to suppose that in the wild flight the band had separated\r\ninto smaller groups, leaving fugitives on the road at every level.\r\nBut the captains were not unanimous when the discussion of possible\r\nattempts at rescue arose. As the passages nearest to the surface were\r\na hundred and fifty metres down, there could be no question of sinking\r\na shaft. R\xc3\xa9quillart remained the one means of access, the only point\r\nby which they could approach. The worst was that the old pit, now\r\nalso inundated, no longer communicated with the Voreux; and above\r\nthe level of the water only a few ends of galleries belonging to the\r\nfirst level were left free. The pumping process would require years,\r\nand the best plan would be to visit these galleries and ascertain if\r\nany of them approached the submerged passages at the end of which the\r\ndistressed miners were suspected to be. Before logically arriving at\r\nthis point, much discussion had been necessary to dispose of a crowd of\r\nimpracticable plans.\r\n\r\nN\xc3\xa9grel now began to stir up the dust of the archives; he discovered\r\nthe old plans of the two pits, studied them, and decided on the points\r\nat which their investigations ought to be carried on. Gradually this\r\nhunt excited him; he was, in his turn, seized by a fever of devotion,\r\nin spite of his ironical indifference to men and things. The first\r\ndifficulty was in going down at R\xc3\xa9quillart; it was necessary to clear\r\nout the rubbish from the mouth of the shaft, to cut down the mountain\r\nash, and raze the sloes and the hawthorns; they had also to repair\r\nthe ladders. Then they began to feel around. The engineer, having\r\ngone down with ten workmen, made them strike the iron of their tools\r\nagainst certain parts of the seam which he pointed out to them; and in\r\ndeep silence they each placed an ear to the coal, listening for any\r\ndistant blows to reply. But they went in vain through every practicable\r\ngallery; no echo returned to them. Their embarrassment increased. At\r\nwhat spot should they cut into the bed? Towards whom should they go,\r\nsince no once appeared to be there? They persisted in seeking, however,\r\nnotwithstanding the exhaustion produced by their growing anxiety.\r\n\r\nOn the first day, Maheude came in the morning to R\xc3\xa9quillart. She sat\r\ndown on a beam in front of the shaft, and did not stir from it till\r\nevening. When a man came up, she rose and questioned him with her eyes:\r\nNothing? No, nothing! And she sat down again, and waited still, without\r\na word, with hard, fixed face. Jeanlin also, seeing that his den was\r\ninvaded, prowled around with the frightened air of a beast of prey\r\nwhose burrow will betray his booty. He thought of the little soldier\r\nlying beneath the rocks, fearing lest they should trouble his sound\r\nsleep; but that side of the mine was beneath the water, and, besides,\r\ntheir investigations were directed more to the left, in the west\r\ngallery. At first, Philom\xc3\xa9ne had also come, accompanying Zacharie, who\r\nwas one of the gang; then she became wearied at catching cold, without\r\nneed or result, and went back to the settlement, dragging through her\r\ndays, a limp, indifferent woman, occupied from morning to night in\r\ncoughing. Zacharie on the contrary, lived for nothing else; he would\r\nhave devoured the soil to get back his sister. At night he shouted out\r\nthat he saw, her, he heard her, very lean from hunger, her chest sore\r\nwith calling for help. Twice he had tried to dig without orders, saying\r\nthat it was there, that he was sure of it. The engineer would not let\r\nhim go down any more, and he would not go away from the pit, from which\r\nhe was driven off; he could not even sit down and wait near his mother,\r\nhe was so deeply stirred by the need to act, which drove him constantly\r\non.\r\n\r\nIt was the third day. N\xc3\xa9grel, in despair, had resolved to abandon the\r\nattempt in the evening. At midday, after lunch, when he came back with\r\nhis men to make one last effort, he was surprised to see Zacharie, red\r\nand gesticulating, come out of the mine shouting:\r\n\r\n"She\'s there! She\'s replied to me! Come along, quickly!"\r\n\r\nHe had slid down the ladders, in spite of the watchman, and was\r\ndeclaring that he had heard hammering over there, in the first passage\r\nof the Guillaume seam.\r\n\r\n"But we have already been twice in that direction," N\xc3\xa9grel observed,\r\nsceptically. "Anyhow, we\'ll go and see."\r\n\r\nMaheude had risen, and had to be prevented from going down. She waited,\r\nstanding at the edge of the shaft, gazing down into the darkness of the\r\nhole.\r\n\r\nN\xc3\xa9grel, down below, himself struck three blows, at long intervals. He\r\nthen applied his ear to the coal, cautioning the workers to be very\r\nsilent. Not a sound reached him, and he shook his head; evidently\r\nthe poor lad was dreaming. In a fury, Zacharie struck in his turn,\r\nand listened anew with bright eyes, and limbs trembling with joy.\r\nThen the other workmen tried the experiment, one after the other,\r\nand all grew animated, hearing the distant reply quite clearly. The\r\nengineer was astonished; he again applied his ear, and was at last\r\nable to catch a sound of aerial softness, a rhythmical roll scarcely\r\nto be distinguished, the well-known cadence beaten by the miners\r\nwhen they are fighting against the coal in the midst of danger. The\r\ncoal transmits the sound with crystalline limpidity for a very great\r\ndistance. A captain who was there estimated that the thickness of the\r\nblock which separated them from their mates could not be less than\r\nfifty metres. But it seemed as if they could already stretch out a hand\r\nto them, and general gladness broke out. N\xc3\xa9grel decided to begin at\r\nonce the work of approach.\r\n\r\nWhen Zacharie, up above, saw Maheude again, they embraced each other.\r\n\r\n"It won\'t do to get excited," Pierronne, who had come for a visit of\r\ninquisitiveness, was cruel enough to say. "If Catherine isn\'t there, it\r\nwould be such a grief afterwards!"\r\n\r\nThat was true; Catherine might be somewhere else.\r\n\r\n"Just leave me alone, will you? Damn it!" cried Zacharie in a rage.\r\n"She\'s there; I know it!"\r\n\r\nMaheude sat down again in silence, with motionless face, continuing to\r\nwait.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the story was spread at Montsou, a new crowd arrived.\r\nNothing was to be seen; but they remained there all the same, and had\r\nto be kept at a distance. Down below, the work went on day and night.\r\nFor fear of meeting an obstacle, the engineer had had three descending\r\ngalleries opened in the seam, converging to the point where the\r\nenclosed miners were supposed to be. Only one pikeman could hew at the\r\ncoal on the narrow face of the tube; he was relieved every two hours,\r\nand the coal piled in baskets was passed up, from hand to hand, by a\r\nchain of men, increased as the hole was hollowed out. The work at first\r\nproceeded very quickly; they did six metres a day.\r\n\r\nZacharie had secured a place among the workers chosen for the hewing.\r\nIt was a post of honour which was disputed over, and he became furious\r\nwhen they wished to relieve him after his regulation two hours of\r\nlabour. He robbed his mates of their turn, and refused to let go the\r\npick. His gallery was soon in advance of the others. He fought against\r\nthe coal so fiercely that his breath could be heard coming from the\r\ntube like the roar of a forge within his breast. When he came out,\r\nblack and muddy, dizzy with fatigue, he fell to the ground and had to\r\nbe wrapped up in a covering. Then, still tottering, he plunged back\r\nagain, and the struggle began anew--the low, deep blows, the stifled\r\ngroans, the victorious fury of massacre. The worst was that the coal\r\nnow became hard; he twice broke his tool, and was exasperated that\r\nhe could not get on so fast. He suffered also from the heat, which\r\nincreased with every metre of advance, and was unbearable at the end of\r\nthis narrow hole where the air could not circulate. A hand ventilator\r\nworked well, but aeration was so inadequate that on three occasions it\r\nwas necessary to take out fainting hewers who were being asphyxiated.\r\n\r\nN\xc3\xa9grel lived below with his men. His meals were sent down to him, and\r\nhe sometimes slept for a couple of hours on a truss of straw, rolled\r\nin a cloak. The one thing that kept them up was the supplication of\r\nthe wretches beyond, the call which was sounded ever more distinctly\r\nto hasten on the rescue. It now rang very clearly with a musical\r\nsonority, as though struck on the plates of a harmonica. It led them\r\non; they advanced to this crystalline sound as men advance to the sound\r\nof cannon in battle. Every time that a pikeman was relieved, N\xc3\xa9grel\r\nwent down and struck, then applied his ear; and every time, so far,\r\nthe reply had come, rapid and urgent. He had no doubt remaining; they\r\nwere advancing in the right direction, but with what fatal slowness!\r\nThey would never arrive soon enough. On the first two days they had\r\nindeed hewn through thirteen metres; but on the third day they fell to\r\nfive, and then on the fourth to three. The coal was becoming closer\r\nand harder, to such an extent that they now with difficulty struck\r\nthrough two metres. On the ninth day, after superhuman efforts, they\r\nhad advanced thirty-two metres, and calculated that some twenty must\r\nstill be left before them. For the prisoners it was the beginning of\r\nthe twelfth day; twelve times over had they passed twenty-four hours\r\nwithout bread, without fire, in that icy darkness! This awful idea\r\nmoistened the eyelids and stiffened the arm of the workers. It seemed\r\nimpossible that Christians could live longer. The distant blows had\r\nbecome weaker since the previous day, and every moment they trembled\r\nlest they should stop.\r\n\r\nMaheude came regularly every morning to sit at the mouth of the\r\nshaft. In her arms she brought Estelle, who could not remain alone\r\nfrom morning to night. Hour by hour she followed the workers, sharing\r\ntheir hopes and fears. There was feverish expectation among the groups\r\nstanding around, and even as far as Montsou, with endless discussion.\r\nEvery heart in the district was beating down there beneath the earth.\r\n\r\nOn the ninth day, at the breakfast hour, no reply came from Zacharie\r\nwhen he was called for the relay. He was like a madman, working on\r\nfuriously with oaths. N\xc3\xa9grel, who had come up for a moment, was not\r\nthere to make him obey, and only a captain and three miners were below.\r\nNo doubt Zacharie, infuriated with the feeble vacillating light,\r\nwhich delayed his work, committed the imprudence of opening his lamp,\r\nalthough severe orders had been given, for leakages of fire-damp had\r\ntaken place, and the gas remained in enormous masses in these narrow,\r\nunventilated passages. Suddenly, a roar of thunder was heard, and a\r\nspout of fire darted out of the tube as from the mouth of a cannon\r\ncharged with grapeshot. Everything flamed up and the air caught fire\r\nlike powder, from one end of the galleries to the other. This torrent\r\nof flame carried away the captain and three workers, ascended the pit,\r\nand leapt up to the daylight in an eruption which split the rocks and\r\nthe ruins around. The inquisitive fled, and Maheude arose, pressing the\r\nfrightened Estelle to her breast.\r\n\r\nWhen N\xc3\xa9grel and the men came back they were seized by a terrible\r\nrage. They struck their heels on the earth as on a stepmother who was\r\nkilling her children at random in the imbecile whims of her cruelty.\r\nThey were devoting themselves, they were coming to the help of their\r\nmates, and still they must lose some of their men! After three long\r\nhours of effort and danger they reached the galleries once more, and\r\nthe melancholy ascent of the victims took place. Neither the captain\r\nnor the workers were dead, but they were covered by awful wounds which\r\ngave out an odour of grilled flesh; they had drunk of fire, the burns\r\nhad got into their throats, and they constantly moaned and prayed to be\r\nfinished off. One of the three miners was the man who had smashed the\r\npump at Gaston-Marie with a final blow of the shovel during the strike;\r\nthe two others still had scars on their hands, and grazed, torn fingers\r\nfrom the energy with which they had thrown bricks at the soldiers. The\r\npale and shuddering crowd took off their hats when they were carried by.\r\n\r\nMaheude stood waiting. Zacharie\'s body at last appeared. The clothes\r\nwere burnt, the body was nothing but black charcoal, calcined and\r\nunrecognizable. The head had been smashed by the explosion and\r\nno longer existed. And when these awful remains were placed on a\r\nstretcher, Maheude followed them mechanically, her burning eyelids\r\nwithout a tear. With Estelle drowsily lying in her arms, she went\r\nalong, a tragic figure, her hair lashed by the wind. At the settlement\r\nPhilom\xc3\xa9ne seemed stupid; her eyes were turned into fountains and she\r\nwas quickly relieved. But the mother had already returned with the same\r\nstep to R\xc3\xa9quillart; she had accompanied her son, she was returning to\r\nwait for her daughter.\r\n\r\nThree more days passed by. The rescue work had been resumed amid\r\nincredible difficulties. The galleries of approach had fortunately not\r\nfallen after the fire-damp explosion; but the air was so heavy and\r\nso vitiated that more ventilators had to be installed. Every twenty\r\nminutes the pikemen relieved one another. They were advancing; scarcely\r\ntwo metres separated them from their mates. But now they worked feeling\r\ncold at their hearts, striking hard only out of vengeance; for the\r\nnoises had ceased, and the low, clear cadence of the call no longer\r\nsounded. It was the twelfth day of their labours, the fifteenth since\r\nthe catastrophe; and since the morning there had been a death-like\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\nThe new accident increased the curiosity at Montsou, and the\r\ninhabitants organized excursions with such spirit that the Gr\xc3\xa9goires\r\ndecided to follow the fashion. They arranged a party, and it was agreed\r\nthat they should go to the Voreux in their carriage, while Madame\r\nHennebeau took Lucie and Jeanne there in hers. Deneulin would show them\r\nover his yards and then they would return by R\xc3\xa9quillart, where N\xc3\xa9grel\r\nwould tell them the exact state of things in the galleries, and if\r\nthere was still hope. Finally, they would dine together in the evening.\r\n\r\nWhen the Gr\xc3\xa9goires and their daughter C\xc3\xa9cile arrived at the ruined\r\nmine, toward three o\'clock, they found Madame Hennebeau already there,\r\nin a sea-blue dress, protecting herself under her parasol from the pale\r\nFebruary sun. The warmth of spring was in the clear sky. M. Hennebeau\r\nwas there with Deneulin, and she was listening, with listless ear, to\r\nthe account which the latter gave her of the efforts which had been\r\nmade to dam up the canal. Jeanne, who always carried a sketch-book with\r\nher, began to draw, carried away by the horror of the subject; while\r\nLucie, seated beside her on the remains of a wagon, was crying out with\r\npleasure, and finding it awfully jolly. The incomplete dam allowed\r\nnumerous leaks, and frothy streams fell in a cascade down the enormous\r\nhole of the engulfed mine. The crater was being emptied, however, and\r\nthe water, drunk by the earth, was sinking, and revealing the fearful\r\nruin at the bottom. Beneath the tender azure of this beautiful day\r\nthere lay a sewer, the ruins of a town drowned and melted in mud.\r\n\r\n"And people come out of their way to see that!" exclaimed M. Gr\xc3\xa9goire,\r\ndisillusioned.\r\n\r\nC\xc3\xa9cile, rosy with health and glad to breathe so pure an air, was\r\ncheerfully joking, while Madame Hennebeau made a little grimace of\r\nrepugnance as she murmured:\r\n\r\n"The fact is, this is not pretty at all."\r\n\r\nThe two engineers laughed. They tried to interest the visitors, taking\r\nthem round and explaining to them the working of the pumps and the\r\nmanipulation of the stamper which drove in the piles. But the ladies\r\nbecame anxious. They shuddered when they knew that the pumps would have\r\nto work for six or seven years before the shaft was reconstructed and\r\nall the water exhausted from the mine. No, they would rather think of\r\nsomething else; this destruction was only good to give bad dreams.\r\n\r\n"Let us go," said Madame Hennebeau, turning towards her carriage.\r\n\r\nLucie and Jeanne protested. What! so soon! and the drawing which was\r\nnot finished. They wanted to remain; their father would bring them to\r\ndinner in the evening.\r\n\r\nM. Hennebeau alone took his place with his wife in the carriage, for he\r\nwished to question N\xc3\xa9grel.\r\n\r\n"Very well! go on before," said M. Gr\xc3\xa9goire. "We will follow you;\r\nwe have a little visit of five minutes to make over there at the\r\nsettlement. Go on, go on! we shall be at R\xc3\xa9quillart as soon as you."\r\n\r\nHe got up behind Madame Gr\xc3\xa9goire and C\xc3\xa9cile, and while the other\r\ncarriage went along by the canal, theirs gently ascended the slope.\r\n\r\nTheir excursion was to be completed by a visit of charity. Zacharie\'s\r\ndeath had filled them with pity for this tragical Maheu family, about\r\nwhom the whole country was talking. They had no pity for the father,\r\nthat brigand, that slayer of soldiers, who had to be struck down like\r\na wolf. But the mother touched them, that poor woman who had just lost\r\nher son after having lost her husband, and whose daughter was perhaps a\r\ncorpse beneath the earth; to say nothing of an invalid grandfather, a\r\nchild who was lame as the result of a landslip, and a little girl who\r\ndied of starvation during the strike. So that, though this family had\r\nin part deserved its misfortunes by the detestable spirit it had shown,\r\nthey had resolved to assert the breadth of their charity, their desire\r\nfor forgetfulness and conciliation, by themselves bringing on alms. Two\r\nparcels, carefully wrapped up, had been placed beneath a seat of the\r\ncarriage.\r\n\r\nAn old woman pointed out to the coachman Maheude\'s house, No. 16 in\r\nthe second block. But when the Gr\xc3\xa9goires alighted with the parcels,\r\nthey knocked in vain; at last they struck their fists against the door,\r\nstill without reply; the house echoed mournfully, like a house emptied\r\nby grief, frozen and dark, long since abandoned.\r\n\r\n"There\'s no one there," said C\xc3\xa9cile, disappointed. "What a nuisance!\r\nWhat shall we do with all this?"\r\n\r\nSuddenly the door of the next house opened, and the Levaque woman\r\nappeared.\r\n\r\n"Oh, sir! I beg pardon, ma\'am. Excuse me, miss. It\'s the neighbour that\r\nyou want? She\'s not there; she\'s at R\xc3\xa9quillart."\r\n\r\nWith a flow of words she told them the story, repeating to them that\r\npeople must help one another, and that she was keeping L\xc3\xa9nore and\r\nHenri in her house to allow the mother to go and wait over there. Her\r\neyes had fallen on the parcels, and she began to talk about her poor\r\ndaughter, who had become a widow, displaying her own wretchedness,\r\nwhile her eyes shone with covetousness. Then, in a hesitating way, she\r\nmuttered:\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got the key. If the lady and gentleman would really like---- The\r\ngrandfather is there."\r\n\r\nThe Gr\xc3\xa9goires looked at her in stupefaction. What! The grandfather was\r\nthere! But no one had replied. He was sleeping, then? And when the\r\nLevaque made up her mind to open the door, what they saw stopped them\r\non the threshold. Bonnemort was there alone, with large fixed eyes,\r\nnailed to his chair in front of the cold fireplace. Around him the room\r\nappeared larger without the clock or the polished deal furniture which\r\nformerly animated it; there only remained against the green crudity of\r\nthe walls the portraits of the Emperor and Empress, whose rosy lips\r\nwere smiling with official benevolence. The old man did not stir nor\r\nwink his eyelids beneath the sudden light from the door; he seemed\r\nimbecile, as though he had not seen all these people come in. At his\r\nfeet lay his plate, garnished with ashes, such as is placed for cats\r\nfor ordure.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t mind if he\'s not very polite," said the Levaque woman,\r\nobligingly. "Seems he\'s broken something in his brain. It\'s a fortnight\r\nsince he left off speaking."\r\n\r\nBut Bonnemort was shaken by some agitation, a deep scraping which\r\nseemed to arise from his belly, and he expectorated into the plate a\r\nthick black expectoration. The ashes were soaked into a coaly mud,\r\nall the coal of the mine which he drew from his chest. He had already\r\nresumed his immobility. He stirred no more, except at intervals, to\r\nspit.\r\n\r\nUneasy, and with stomachs turned, the Gr\xc3\xa9goires endeavoured to utter a\r\nfew friendly and encouraging words.\r\n\r\n"Well, my good man," said the father, "you have a cold, then?"\r\n\r\nThe old man, with his eyes to the wall, did not turn his head. And a\r\nheavy silence fell once more.\r\n\r\n"They ought to make you a little gruel," added the mother.\r\n\r\nHe preserved his mute stiffness.\r\n\r\n"I say, papa," murmured C\xc3\xa9cile, "they certainly told us he was an\r\ninvalid; only we did not think of it afterwards--"\r\n\r\nShe interrupted herself, much embarrassed. After having placed on the\r\ntable a _pot-au-feu_ and two bottles of wine, she undid the second\r\nparcel and drew from it a pair of enormous boots. It was the present\r\nintended for the grandfather, and she held one boot in each hand, in\r\nconfusion, contemplating the poor man\'s swollen feet, which would never\r\nwalk again.\r\n\r\n"Eh! they come a little late, don\'t they, my worthy fellow?" said M.\r\nGr\xc3\xa9goire again, to enliven the situation. "It doesn\'t matter, they\'re\r\nalways useful."\r\n\r\nBonnemort neither heard nor replied, with his terrible face as cold and\r\nas hard as a stone.\r\n\r\nThen C\xc3\xa9cile furtively placed the boots against the wall. But in spite\r\nof her precautions the nails clanked; and those enormous boots stood\r\noppressively in the room.\r\n\r\n"He won\'t say thank you," said the Levaque woman, who had cast a look\r\nof deep envy on the boots. "Might as well give a pair of spectacles to\r\na duck, asking your pardon."\r\n\r\nShe went on; she was trying to draw the Gr\xc3\xa9goires into her own house,\r\nwhere she hoped to gain their pity. At last she thought of a pretext;\r\nshe praised Henri and L\xc3\xa9nore, who were so good, so gentle, and so\r\nintelligent, answering like angels the questions that they were asked.\r\nThey would tell the lady and gentleman all that they wished to know.\r\n\r\n"Will you come for a moment, my child?" asked the father, glad to get\r\naway.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I\'ll follow you," she replied.\r\n\r\nC\xc3\xa9cile remained alone with Bonnemort. What kept her there trembling\r\nand fascinated, was the thought that she seemed to recognize this old\r\nman: where then had she met this square livid face, tattooed with coal?\r\nSuddenly she remembered; she saw again a mob of shouting people who\r\nsurrounded her, and she felt cold hands pressing her neck. It was he;\r\nshe saw the man again; she looked at his hands placed on his knees,\r\nthe hands of an invalid workman whose whole strength is in his wrists,\r\nstill firm in spite of age. Gradually Bonnemort seemed to awake, he\r\nperceived her and examined her in his turn. A flame mounted to his\r\ncheeks, a nervous spasm drew his mouth, from which flowed a thin streak\r\nof black saliva. Fascinated, they remained opposite each other--she\r\nflourishing, plump, and fresh from the long idleness and sated comfort\r\nof her race; he swollen with water, with the pitiful ugliness of a\r\nfoundered beast, destroyed from father to son by a century of work and\r\nhunger.\r\n\r\nAt the end of ten minutes, when the Gr\xc3\xa9goires, surprised at not seeing\r\nC\xc3\xa9cile, came back into the Maheus\' house, they uttered a terrible cry.\r\nTheir daughter was lying on the ground, with livid face, strangled. At\r\nher neck fingers had left the red imprint of a giant\'s hand. Bonnemort,\r\ntottering on his dead legs, had fallen beside her without power to\r\nrise. His hands were still hooked, and he looked round with his\r\nimbecile air and large open eyes. In his fall he had broken his plate,\r\nthe ashes were spread round, the mud of the black expectoration had\r\nstained the floor; while the great pair of boots, safe and sound, stood\r\nside by side against the wall.\r\n\r\nIt was never possible to establish the exact facts. Why had C\xc3\xa9cile come\r\nnear? How could Bonnemort, nailed to his chair, have been able to seize\r\nher throat? Evidently, when he held her, he must have become furious,\r\nconstantly pressing, overthrown with her, and stifling her cries to the\r\nlast groan. Not a sound, not a moan had traversed the thin partition to\r\nthe neighbouring house. It seemed to be an outbreak of sudden madness,\r\na longing to murder before this white young neck. Such savagery was\r\nstupefying in an old invalid, who had lived like a worthy man, an\r\nobedient brute, opposed to new ideas. What rancour, unknown to himself,\r\nby some slow process of poisoning, had risen from his bowels to his\r\nbrain? The horror of it led to the conclusion that he was unconscious,\r\nthat it was the crime of an idiot.\r\n\r\nThe Gr\xc3\xa9goires, meanwhile, on their knees, were sobbing, choked with\r\ngrief. Their idolized daughter, that daughter desired so long, on whom\r\nthey had lavished all their goods, whom they used to watch sleeping,\r\non tiptoe, whom they never thought sufficiently well nourished, never\r\nsufficiently plump! It was the downfall of their very life; what was\r\nthe good of living, now that they would have to live without her?\r\n\r\nThe Levaque woman in distraction cried:\r\n\r\n"Ah, the old beggar! what\'s he done there? Who would have expected such\r\na thing? And Maheude, who won\'t come back till evening! Shall I go and\r\nfetch her?"\r\n\r\nThe father and mother were crushed, and did not reply.\r\n\r\n"Eh? It will be better. I\'ll go."\r\n\r\nBut, before going, the Levaque woman looked at the boots. The whole\r\nsettlement was excited, and a crowd was already hustling around.\r\nPerhaps they would get stolen. And then the Maheus had no man, now,\r\nto put them on. She quietly carried them away. They would just fit\r\nBouteloup\'s feet.\r\n\r\nAt R\xc3\xa9quillart the Hennebeaus, with N\xc3\xa9grel, waited a long time for the\r\nGr\xc3\xa9goires. N\xc3\xa9grel, who had come up from the pit, gave details. They\r\nhoped to communicate that very evening with the prisoners, but they\r\nwould certainly find nothing but corpses, for the death-like silence\r\ncontinued. Behind the engineer, Maheude, seated on the beam, was\r\nlistening with white face, when the Levaque woman came up and told her\r\nthe old man\'s strange deed. And she only made a sweeping gesture of\r\nimpatience and irritation. She followed her, however.\r\n\r\nMadame Hennebeau was much affected. What an abomination! That poor\r\nC\xc3\xa9cile, so merry that very day, so full of life an hour before! M.\r\nHennebeau had to lead his wife for a moment into old Mouque\'s hovel.\r\nWith his awkward hands he unfastened her dress, troubled by the odour\r\nof musk which her open bodice exhaled. And as with streaming tears she\r\nclasped N\xc3\xa9grel, terrified at this death which cut short the marriage,\r\nthe husband watched them lamenting together, and was delivered from one\r\nanxiety. This misfortune would arrange everything; he preferred to keep\r\nhis nephew for fear of his coachman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of the shaft the abandoned wretches were yelling with\r\nterror. The water now came up to their hips. The noise of the torrent\r\ndazed them, the final falling in of the tubbing sounded like the last\r\ncrack of doom; and their bewilderment was completed by the neighing of\r\nthe horses shut up in the stable, the terrible, unforgettable death-cry\r\nof an animal that is being slaughtered.\r\n\r\nMouque had let go Bataille. The old horse was there, trembling, with\r\nits dilated eye fixed on this water which was constantly rising. The\r\npit-eye was rapidly filling; the greenish flood slowly enlarged under\r\nthe red gleam of the three lamps which were still burning under the\r\nroof. And suddenly, when he felt this ice soaking his coat, he set out\r\nin a furious gallop, and was engulfed and lost at the end of one of the\r\nhaulage galleries.\r\n\r\nThen there was a general rush, the men following the beast.\r\n\r\n"Nothing more to be done in this damned hole!" shouted Mouque. "We must\r\ntry at R\xc3\xa9quillart."\r\n\r\nThe idea that they might get out by the old neighbouring pit if\r\nthey arrived before the passage was cut off, now carried them away.\r\nThe twenty hustled one another as they went in single file, holding\r\ntheir lamps in the air so that the water should not extinguish them.\r\nFortunately, the gallery rose with an imperceptible slope, and they\r\nproceeded for two hundred metres, struggling against the flood, which\r\nwas not now gaining on them. Sleeping beliefs reawakened in these\r\ndistracted souls; they invoked the earth, for it was the earth that\r\nwas avenging herself, discharging the blood from the vein because they\r\nhad cut one of her arteries. An old man stammered forgotten prayers,\r\nbending his thumbs backwards to appease the evil spirits of the mine.\r\n\r\nBut at the first turning disagreement broke out; the groom proposed\r\nturning to the left, others declared that they could make a short cut\r\nby going to the right. A minute was lost.\r\n\r\n"Well, die there! what the devil does it matter to me?" Chaval brutally\r\nexclaimed. "I go this way."\r\n\r\nHe turned to the right, and two mates followed him. The others\r\ncontinued to rush behind Father Mouque, who had grown up at the bottom\r\nof R\xc3\xa9quillart. He himself hesitated, however, not knowing where to\r\nturn. They lost their heads; even the old men could no longer recognize\r\nthe passages, which lay like a tangled skein before them. At every\r\nbifurcation they were pulled up short by uncertainty, and yet they had\r\nto decide.\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne was running last, delayed by Catherine, who was paralysed by\r\nfatigue and fear. He would have gone to the right with Chaval, for he\r\nthought that the better road; but he had not, preferring to part from\r\nChaval. The rush continued, however; some of the mates had gone from\r\ntheir side, and only seven were left behind old Mouque.\r\n\r\n"Hang on to my neck and I will carry you," said \xc3\x89tienne to the young\r\ngirl, seeing her grow weak.\r\n\r\n"No, let me be," she murmured. "I can\'t do more; I would rather die at\r\nonce."\r\n\r\nThey delayed and were left fifty metres behind; he was lifting her,\r\nin spite of her resistance, when the gallery was suddenly stopped up;\r\nan enormous block fell in and separated them from the others. The\r\ninundation was already soaking the soil, which was shifting on every\r\nside. They had to retrace their steps; then they no longer knew in what\r\ndirection they were going. There was an end of all hope of escaping by\r\nR\xc3\xa9quillart. Their only remaining hope was to gain the upper workings,\r\nfrom which they might perhaps be delivered if the water sank.\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne at last recognized the Guillaume seam.\r\n\r\n"Good!" he exclaimed. "Now I know where we are. By God! we were in the\r\nright road; but we may go to the devil now! Here, let us go straight\r\non; we will climb up the passage."\r\n\r\nThe flood was beating against their breasts, and they walked very\r\nslowly. As long as they had light they did not despair, and they blew\r\nout one of the lamps to economize the oil, meaning to empty it into the\r\nother lamp. They had reached the chimney passage, when a noise behind\r\nmade them turn. Was it some mates, then, who had also found the road\r\nbarred and were returning? A roaring sound came from afar; they could\r\nnot understand this tempest which approached them, spattering foam. And\r\nthey cried out when they saw a gigantic whitish mass coming out of the\r\nshadow and trying to rejoin them between the narrow timbering in which\r\nit was being crushed.\r\n\r\nIt was Bataille. On leaving the pit-eye he had wildly galloped along\r\nthe dark galleries. He seemed to know his road in this subterranean\r\ntown which he had inhabited for eleven years, and his eyes saw clearly\r\nin the depths of the eternal night in which he had lived. He galloped\r\non and on, bending his head, drawing up his feet, passing through these\r\nnarrow tubes in the earth, filled by his great body. Road succeeded\r\nto road, and the forked turnings were passed without any hesitation.\r\nWhere was he going? Over there, perhaps, towards that vision of his\r\nyouth, to the mill where he had been born on the bank of the Scarpe, to\r\nthe confused recollection of the sun burning in the air like a great\r\nlamp. He desired to live, his beast\'s memory awoke; the longing to\r\nbreathe once more the air of the plains drove him straight onwards to\r\nthe discovery of that hole, the exit beneath the warm sun into light.\r\nRebellion carried away his ancient resignation; this pit was murdering\r\nhim after having blinded him. The water which pursued him was lashing\r\nhim on the flanks and biting him on the crupper. But as he went deeper\r\nin, the galleries became narrower, the roofs lower, and the walls\r\nprotruded. He galloped on in spite of everything, grazing himself,\r\nleaving shreds of his limbs on the timber. From every side the mine\r\nseemed to be pressing on to him to take him and to stifle him.\r\n\r\nThen \xc3\x89tienne and Catherine, as he came near them, perceived that he\r\nwas strangling between the rocks. He had stumbled and broken his two\r\nfront legs. With a last effort, he dragged himself a few metres, but\r\nhis flanks could not pass; he remained hemmed in and garrotted by the\r\nearth. With his bleeding head stretched out, he still sought for some\r\ncrack with his great troubled eyes. The water was rapidly covering\r\nhim; he began to neigh with that terrible prolonged death-rattle with\r\nwhich the other horses had already died in the stable. It was a sight\r\nof fearful agony, this old beast shattered and motionless, struggling\r\nat this depth, far from the daylight. The flood was drowning his mane,\r\nand his cry of distress never ceased; he uttered it more hoarsely, with\r\nhis large open mouth stretched out. There was a last rumble, the hollow\r\nsound of a cask which is being filled; then deep silence fell.\r\n\r\n"Oh, my God! take me away!" Catherine sobbed. "Ah, my God! I\'m afraid;\r\nI don\'t want to die. Take me away! take me away!"\r\n\r\nShe had seen death. The fallen shaft, the inundated mine, nothing had\r\nseized her with such terror as this clamour of Bataille in agony. And\r\nshe constantly heard it; her ears were ringing with it; all her flesh\r\nwas shuddering with it.\r\n\r\n"Take me away! take me away!"\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne had seized her and lifted her; it was, indeed, time. They\r\nascended the chimney passage, soaked to the shoulders. He was obliged\r\nto help her, for she had no strength to cling to the timber. Three\r\ntimes over he thought that she was slipping from him and falling back\r\ninto that deep sea of which the tide was roaring beneath them. However,\r\nthey were able to breathe for a few minutes when they reached the first\r\ngallery, which was still free. The water reappeared, and they had to\r\nhoist themselves up again. And for hours this ascent continued, the\r\nflood chasing them from passage to passage, and constantly forcing them\r\nto ascend. At the sixth level a respite rendered them feverish with\r\nhope, and it seemed that the waters were becoming stationary. But a\r\nmore rapid rise took place, and they had to climb to the seventh and\r\nthen to the eighth level. Only one remained, and when they had reached\r\nit they anxiously watched each centimetre by which the water gained\r\non them. If it did not stop they would then die like the old horse,\r\ncrushed against the roof, and their chests filled by the flood.\r\n\r\nLandslips echoed every moment. The whole mine was shaken, and its\r\ndistended bowels burst with the enormous flood which gorged them. At\r\nthe end of the galleries the air, driven back, pressed together and\r\ncrushed, exploded terribly amid split rocks and overthrown soil. It was\r\na terrifying uproar of interior cataclysms, a remnant of the ancient\r\nbattle when deluges overthrew the earth, burying the mountains beneath\r\nthe plains.\r\n\r\nAnd Catherine, shaken and dazed by this continuous downfall, joined her\r\nhands, stammering the same words without cessation:\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to die! I don\'t want to die!"\r\n\r\nTo reassure her, \xc3\x89tienne declared that the water was not now moving.\r\nTheir flight had lasted for fully six hours, and they would soon be\r\nrescued. He said six hours without knowing, for they had lost all count\r\nof time. In reality, a whole day had already passed in their climb up\r\nthrough the Guillaume seam.\r\n\r\nDrenched and shivering, they settled themselves down. She undressed\r\nherself without shame and wrung out her clothes, then she put on\r\nagain the jacket and breeches, and let them finish drying on her. As\r\nher feet were bare, he made her take his own sabots. They could wait\r\npatiently now; they had lowered the wick of the lamp, leaving only the\r\nfeeble gleam of a night-light. But their stomachs were torn by cramp,\r\nand they both realized that they were dying of hunger. Up till now\r\nthey had not felt that they were living. The catastrophe had occurred\r\nbefore breakfast, and now they found their bread-and-butter swollen\r\nby the water and changed into sop. She had to become angry before he\r\nwould accept his share. As soon as she had eaten she fell asleep from\r\nweariness, on the cold earth. He was devoured by insomnia, and watched\r\nover her with fixed eyes and forehead between his hands.\r\n\r\nHow many hours passed by thus? He would have been unable to say. All\r\nthat he knew was that before him, through the hole they had ascended,\r\nhe had seen the flood reappear, black and moving, the beast whose back\r\nwas ceaselessly swelling out to reach them. At first it was only a thin\r\nline, a supple serpent stretching itself out; then it enlarged into a\r\ncrawling, crouching flank; and soon it reached them, and the sleeping\r\ngirl\'s feet were touched by it. In his anxiety he yet hesitated to wake\r\nher. Was it not cruel to snatch her from this repose of unconscious\r\nignorance, which was, perhaps, lulling her with a dream of the open\r\nair and of life beneath the sun? Besides, where could they fly? And he\r\nthought and remembered that the upbrow established at this part of the\r\nseam communicated end to end with that which served the upper level.\r\nThat would be a way out. He let her sleep as long as possible, watching\r\nthe flood gain on them, waiting for it to chase them away. At last he\r\nlifted her gently, and a great shudder passed over her.\r\n\r\n"Ah, my God! it\'s true! it\'s beginning again, my God!"\r\n\r\nShe remembered, she cried out, again finding death so near.\r\n\r\n"No! calm yourself," he whispered. "We can pass, upon my word!"\r\n\r\nTo reach the upbrow they had to walk doubled up, again wetted to the\r\nshoulders. And the climbing began anew, now more dangerous, through\r\nthis hole entirely of timber, a hundred metres long. At first they\r\nwished to pull the cable so as to fix one of the carts at the bottom,\r\nfor if the other should come down during their ascent, they would\r\nbe crushed. But nothing moved, some obstacle interfered with the\r\nmechanism. They ventured in, not daring to make use of the cable which\r\nwas in their way, and tearing their nails against the smooth framework.\r\nHe came behind, supporting her by his head when she slipped with torn\r\nhands. Suddenly they came across the splinters of a beam which barred\r\nthe way. A portion of the soil had fallen down and prevented them from\r\ngoing any higher. Fortunately a door opened here and they passed into a\r\npassage. They were stupefied to see the flicker of a lamp in front of\r\nthem. A man cried wildly to them:\r\n\r\n"More clever people as big fools as I am!"\r\n\r\nThey recognized Chaval, who had found himself blocked by the landslip\r\nwhich filled the upbrow; his two mates who had set out with him had\r\nbeen left on the way with fractured skulls. He was wounded in the\r\nelbow, but had had the courage to go back on his knees, take their\r\nlamps, and search them to steal their bread-and-butter. As he escaped,\r\na final downfall behind his back had closed the gallery.\r\n\r\nHe immediately swore that he would not share his victuals with these\r\npeople who came up out of the earth. He would sooner knock their brains\r\nout. Then he, too, recognized them; his anger fell, and he began to\r\nlaugh with a laugh of evil joy.\r\n\r\n"Ah! it\'s you, Catherine! you\'ve broken your nose, and you want to join\r\nyour man again. Well, well! we\'ll play out the game together."\r\n\r\nHe pretended not to see \xc3\x89tienne. The latter, overwhelmed by this\r\nencounter, made a gesture as though to protect the putter, who was\r\npressing herself against him. He must, however, accept the situation.\r\nSpeaking as though they had left each other good friends an hour\r\nbefore, he simply asked:\r\n\r\n"Have you looked down below? We can\'t pass through the cuttings, then?"\r\n\r\nChaval still grinned.\r\n\r\n"Ah, bosh! the cuttings! They\'ve fallen in too; we are between two\r\nwalls, a real mousetrap. But you can go back by the brow if you are a\r\ngood diver."\r\n\r\nThe water, in fact, was rising; they could hear it rippling. Their\r\nretreat was already cut off. And he was right; it was a mousetrap,\r\na gallery-end obstructed before and behind by considerable falls of\r\nearth. There was not one issue; all three were walled up.\r\n\r\n"Then you\'ll stay?" Chaval added, jeeringly. "Well, it\'s the best you\r\ncan do, and if you\'ll just leave me alone, I shan\'t even speak to you.\r\nThere\'s still room here for two men. We shall soon see which will die\r\nfirst, provided they don\'t come to us, which seems a tough job."\r\n\r\nThe young man said:\r\n\r\n"If we were to hammer, they would hear us, perhaps."\r\n\r\n"I\'m tired of hammering. Here, try yourself with this stone."\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne picked up the fragment of sandstone which the other had already\r\nbroken off, and against the seam at the end he struck the miner\'s call,\r\nthe prolonged roll by which workmen in peril signal their presence.\r\nThen he placed his ear to listen. Twenty times over he persisted; no\r\nsound replied.\r\n\r\nDuring this time Chaval affected to be coolly attending to his little\r\nhousehold. First he arranged the three lamps against the wall; only one\r\nwas burning, the others could be used later on. Afterwards, he placed\r\non a piece of timber the two slices of bread-and-butter which were\r\nstill left. That was the sideboard; he could last quite two days with\r\nthat, if he were careful. He turned round saying:\r\n\r\n"You know, Catherine, there will be half for you when you are famished."\r\n\r\nThe young girl was silent. It completed her unhappiness to find herself\r\nagain between these two men.\r\n\r\nAnd their awful life began. Neither Chaval nor \xc3\x89tienne opened their\r\nmouths, seated on the earth a few paces from each other. At a hint\r\nfrom the former the latter extinguished his lamp, a piece of useless\r\nluxury; then they sank back into silence. Catherine was lying down near\r\n\xc3\x89tienne, restless under the glances of her former lover. The hours\r\npassed by; they heard the low murmur of the water for ever rising;\r\nwhile from time to time deep shocks and distant echoes announced the\r\nfinal settling down of the mine. When the lamp was empty and they had\r\nto open another to light it, they were, for a moment, disturbed by\r\nthe fear of fire-damp; but they would rather have been blown up at\r\nonce than live on in darkness. Nothing exploded, however; there was no\r\nfire-damp. They stretched themselves out again, and the hours continued\r\nto pass by.\r\n\r\nA noise aroused \xc3\x89tienne and Catherine, and they raised their\r\nheads. Chaval had decided to eat; he had cut off half a slice of\r\nbread-and-butter, and was chewing it slowly, to avoid the temptation of\r\nswallowing it all. They gazed at him, tortured by hunger.\r\n\r\n"Well, do you refuse?" he said to the putter, in his provoking way.\r\n"You\'re wrong."\r\n\r\nShe had lowered her eyes, fearing to yield; her stomach was torn by\r\nsuch cramps that tears were swelling beneath her eyelids. But she\r\nunderstood what he was asking; in the morning he had breathed over her\r\nneck; he was seized again by one of his old furies of desire on seeing\r\nher near the other man. The glances with which he called her had a\r\nflame in them which she knew well, the flame of his crises of jealousy\r\nwhen he would fall on her with his fists, accusing her of committing\r\nabominations with her mother\'s lodger. And she was not willing; she\r\ntrembled lest, by returning to him, she should throw these two men\r\non to each other in this narrow cave, where they were all in agony\r\ntogether. Good God! why could they not end together in comradeship!\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne would have died of inanition rather than beg a mouthful of\r\nbread from Chaval. The silence became heavy; an eternity seemed to be\r\nprolonging itself with the slowness of monotonous minutes which passed\r\nby, one by one, without hope. They had now been shut up together for a\r\nday. The second lamp was growing pale, and they lighted the third.\r\n\r\nChaval started on his second slice of bread-and-butter, and growled:\r\n\r\n"Come then, stupid!"\r\n\r\nCatherine shivered. \xc3\x89tienne had turned away in order to leave her free.\r\nThen, as she did not stir, he said to her in a low voice:\r\n\r\n"Go, my child."\r\n\r\nThe tears which she was stifling then rushed forth. She wept for a\r\nlong time, without even strength to rise, no longer knowing if she was\r\nhungry, suffering with pain which she felt all over her body. He was\r\nstanding up, going backward and forwards, vainly beating the miners\r\ncall, enraged at this remainder of life which he was obliged to live\r\nhere tied to a rival whom he detested. Not even enough space to die\r\naway from each other! As soon as he had gone ten paces he must come\r\nback and knock up against this man. And she, this sorrowful girl whom\r\nthey were disputing over even in the earth! She would belong to the\r\none who lived longest; that man would steal her from him should he\r\ngo first. There was no end to it; the hours followed the hours; the\r\nrevolting promiscuity became worse, with the poison of their breaths\r\nand the ordure of their necessities satisfied in common. Twice he\r\nrushed against the rocks as though to open them with his fists.\r\n\r\nAnother day was done, and Chaval had seated himself near Catherine,\r\nsharing with her his last half-slice. She was chewing the mouthfuls\r\npainfully; he made her pay for each with a caress, in his jealous\r\nobstinacy not willing to die until he had had her again in the other\r\nman\'s presence. She abandoned herself in exhaustion. But when he tried\r\nto take her she complained.\r\n\r\n"Oh, leave me! you\'re breaking my bones."\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne, with a shudder, had placed his forehead against the timber so\r\nas not to see. He came back with a wild leap.\r\n\r\n"Leave her, by God!"\r\n\r\n"Does it concern you?" said Chaval. "She\'s my woman; I suppose she\r\nbelongs to me!"\r\n\r\nAnd he took her again and pressed her, out of bravado, crushing his red\r\nmoustache against her mouth, and continuing:\r\n\r\n"Will you leave us alone, eh? Will you be good enough to look over\r\nthere if we are at it?"\r\n\r\nBut \xc3\x89tienne, with white lips, shouted:\r\n\r\n"If you don\'t let her go, I\'ll do for you!"\r\n\r\nThe other quickly stood up, for he had understood by the hiss of the\r\nvoice that his mate was in earnest. Death seemed to them too slow; it\r\nwas necessary that one of them should immediately yield his place. It\r\nwas the old battle beginning over again, down in the earth where they\r\nwould soon sleep side by side; and they had so little room that they\r\ncould not swing their fists without grazing them.\r\n\r\n"Look out!" growled Chaval. "This time I\'ll have you."\r\n\r\nFrom that moment \xc3\x89tienne became mad. His eyes seemed drowned in red\r\nvapour, his chest was congested by the flow of blood. The need to kill\r\nseized him irresistibly, a physical need, like the irritation of mucus\r\nwhich causes a violent spasm of coughing. It rose and broke out beyond\r\nhis will, beneath the pressure of the hereditary disease. He had seized\r\na sheet of slate in the wall and he shook it and tore it out, a very\r\nlarge, heavy piece. Then with both hands and with tenfold strength he\r\nbrought it down on Chaval\'s skull.\r\n\r\nThe latter had not time to jump backwards. He fell, his face crushed,\r\nhis skull broken. The brains had bespattered the roof of the gallery,\r\nand a purple jet flowed from the wound, like the continuous jet of a\r\nspring. Immediately there was a pool, which reflected the smoky star\r\nof the lamp. Darkness was invading the walled-up cave, and this body,\r\nlying on the earth, looked like the black boss of a mass of rough coal.\r\n\r\nLeaning over, with wide eyes, \xc3\x89tienne looked at him. It was done, then;\r\nhe had killed. All his struggles came back to his memory confusedly,\r\nthat useless fight against the poison which slept in his muscles,\r\nthe slowly accumulated alcohol of his race. He was, however, only\r\nintoxicated by hunger; the remote intoxication of his parents had been\r\nenough. His hair stood up before the horror of this murder; and yet, in\r\nspite of the revolt which came from his education, a certain gladness\r\nmade his heart beat, the animal joy of an appetite at length satisfied.\r\nHe felt pride, too, the pride of the stronger man. The little soldier\r\nappeared before him, with his throat opened by a knife, killed by a\r\nchild. Now he, too, had killed.\r\n\r\nBut Catherine, standing erect, uttered a loud cry:\r\n\r\n"My God! he is dead!"\r\n\r\n"Are you sorry?" asked \xc3\x89tienne, fiercely.\r\n\r\nShe was choking, she stammered. Then, tottering, she threw herself into\r\nhis arms.\r\n\r\n"Ah, kill me too! Ah, let us both die!"\r\n\r\nShe clasped him, hanging to his shoulders, and he clasped her; and they\r\nhoped that they would die. But death was in no hurry, and they unlocked\r\ntheir arms. Then, while she hid her eyes, he dragged away the wretch,\r\nand threw him down the upbrow, to remove him from the narrow space in\r\nwhich they still had to live. Life would no longer have been possible\r\nwith that corpse beneath their feet. And they were terrified when they\r\nheard it plunge into the midst of the foam which leapt up. The water\r\nhad already filled that hole, then? They saw it; it was entering the\r\ngallery.\r\n\r\nThen there was a new struggle. They had lighted the last lamp; it\r\nwas becoming exhausted in illuminating this flood, with its regular,\r\nobstinate rise which never ceased. At first the water came up to their\r\nankles; then it wetted their knees. The passage sloped up, and they\r\ntook refuge at the end. This gave them a respite for some hours. But\r\nthe flood caught them up, and bathed them to the waist. Standing up,\r\nbrought to bay, with their spines close against the rock, they watched\r\nit ever and ever increasing. When it reached their mouths, all would\r\nbe over. The lamp, which they had fastened up, threw a yellow light\r\non the rapid surge of the little waves. It was becoming pale; they\r\ncould distinguish no more than a constantly diminishing semicircle, as\r\nthough eaten away by the darkness which seemed to grow with the flood;\r\nand suddenly the darkness enveloped them. The lamp had gone out, after\r\nhaving spat forth its last drop of oil. There was now complete and\r\nabsolute night, that night of the earth which they would have to sleep\r\nthrough without ever again opening their eyes to the brightness of the\r\nsun.\r\n\r\n"By God!" \xc3\x89tienne swore, in a low voice.\r\n\r\nCatherine, as though she had felt the darkness seize her, sheltered\r\nherself against him. She repeated, in a whisper, the miner\'s saying:\r\n\r\n"Death is blowing out the lamp."\r\n\r\nYet in the face of this threat their instincts struggled, the fever\r\nfor life animated them. He violently set himself to hollow out the\r\nslate with the hook of the lamp, while she helped him with her nails.\r\nThey formed a sort of elevated bench, and when they had both hoisted\r\nthemselves up to it, they found themselves seated with hanging legs and\r\nbent backs, for the vault forced them to lower their heads. They now\r\nonly felt the icy water at their heels; but before long the cold was at\r\ntheir ankles, their calves, their knees, with its invincible, truceless\r\nmovement. The bench, not properly smoothed, was soaked in moisture, and\r\nso slippery that they had to hold themselves on vigorously to avoid\r\nslipping off. It was the end; what could they expect, reduced to this\r\nniche where they dared not move, exhausted, starving, having neither\r\nbread nor light? and they suffered especially from the darkness,\r\nwhich would not allow them to see the coming of death. There was deep\r\nsilence; the mine, being gorged with water, no longer stirred. They had\r\nnothing beneath them now but the sensation of that sea, swelling out\r\nits silent tide from the depths of the galleries.\r\n\r\nThe hours succeeded one another, all equally black; but they were not\r\nable to measure their exact duration, becoming more and more vague\r\nin their calculation of time. Their tortures, which might have been\r\nexpected to lengthen the minutes, rapidly bore them away. They thought\r\nthat they had only been shut up for two days and a night, when in\r\nreality the third day had already come to an end. All hope of help had\r\ngone; no one knew they were there, no one could come down to them. And\r\nhunger would finish them off if the inundation spared them. For one\r\nlast time it occurred to them to beat the call, but the stone was lying\r\nbeneath the water. Besides, who would hear them?\r\n\r\nCatherine was leaning her aching head against the seam, when she sat up\r\nwith a start.\r\n\r\n"Listen!" she said.\r\n\r\nAt first \xc3\x89tienne thought she was speaking of the low noise of the\r\never-rising water. He lied in order to quiet her.\r\n\r\n"It\'s me you hear; I\'m moving my legs."\r\n\r\n"No, no; not that! Over there, listen!"\r\n\r\nAnd she placed her ear to the coal. He understood, and did likewise.\r\nThey waited for some seconds, with stifled breath. Then, very far away\r\nand very weak, they heard three blows at long intervals. But they still\r\ndoubted; their ears were ringing; perhaps it was the cracking of the\r\nsoil. And they knew not what to strike with in answer.\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne had an idea.\r\n\r\n"You have the sabots. Take them off and strike with the heels."\r\n\r\nShe struck, beating the miner\'s call; and they listened and again\r\ndistinguished the three blows far off. Twenty times over they did it,\r\nand twenty times the blows replied. They wept and embraced each other,\r\nat the risk of losing their balance. At last the mates were there, they\r\nwere coming. An overflowing joy and love carried away the torments\r\nof expectation and the rage of their vain appeals, as though their\r\nrescuers had only to split the rock with a finger to deliver them.\r\n\r\n"Eh!" she cried merrily; "wasn\'t it lucky that I leant my head?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, you\'ve got an ear!" he said in his turn. "Now, _I_ heard\r\nnothing."\r\n\r\nFrom that moment they relieved each other, one of them always\r\nlistening, ready to answer at the least signal. They soon caught the\r\nsounds of the pick; the work of approaching them was beginning, a\r\ngallery was being opened. Not a sound escaped them. But their joy sank.\r\nIn vain they laughed to deceive each other; despair was gradually\r\nseizing them. At first they entered into long explanations; evidently\r\nthey were being approached from R\xc3\xa9quillart. The gallery descended in\r\nthe bed; perhaps several were being opened, for there were always\r\nthree men hewing. Then they talked less, and were at last silent when\r\nthey came to calculate the enormous mass which separated them from\r\ntheir mates. They continued their reflections in silence, counting the\r\ndays and days that a workman would take to penetrate such a block.\r\nThey would never be reached soon enough; they would have time to die\r\ntwenty times over. And no longer venturing to exchange a word in this\r\nredoubled anguish, they gloomily replied to the appeals by a roll of\r\nthe sabots, without hope, only retaining the mechanical need to tell\r\nthe others that they were still alive.\r\n\r\nThus passed a day, two days. They had been at the bottom six days. The\r\nwater had stopped at their knees, neither rising nor falling, and their\r\nlegs seemed to be melting away in this icy bath. They could certainly\r\nkeep them out for an hour or so, but their position then became so\r\nuncomfortable that they were twisted by horrible cramps, and were\r\nobliged to let their feet fall in again. Every ten minutes they hoisted\r\nthemselves back by a jerk on the slippery rock. The fractures of the\r\ncoal struck into their spines, and they felt at the back of their\r\nnecks a fixed intense pain, through having to keep constantly bent in\r\norder to avoid striking their heads. And their suffocation increased;\r\nthe air, driven back by the water, was compressed into a sort of bell\r\nin which they were shut up. Their voices were muffled, and seemed to\r\ncome from afar. Their ears began to buzz, they heard the peals of a\r\nfurious tocsin, the tramp of a flock beneath a storm of hail, going on\r\nunceasingly.\r\n\r\nAt first Catherine suffered horribly from hunger. She pressed her\r\npoor shrivelled hands against her breasts, her breathing was deep and\r\nhollow, a continuous tearing moan, as though tongs were tearing her\r\nstomach.\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne, choked by the same torture, was feeling feverishly round him\r\nin the darkness, when his fingers came upon a half-rotten piece of\r\ntimber, which his nails could crumble. He gave a handful of it to the\r\nputter, who swallowed it greedily. For two days they lived on this\r\nworm-eaten wood, devouring it all, in despair when it was finished,\r\ngrazing their hands in the effort to crush the other planks which were\r\nstill solid with resisting fibres. Their torture increased, and they\r\nwere enraged that they could not chew the cloth of their clothes. A\r\nleather belt, which he wore round the waist, relieved them a little.\r\nHe bit small pieces from it with his teeth, and she chewed them, and\r\nendeavoured to swallow them. This occupied their jaws, and gave them\r\nthe illusion of eating. Then, when the belt was finished, they went\r\nback to their clothes, sucking them for hours.\r\n\r\nBut soon these violent crises subsided; hunger became only a low deep\r\nache with the slow progressive languor of their strength. No doubt they\r\nwould have succumbed if they had not had as much water as they desired.\r\nThey merely bent down and drank from the hollow of the hand, and that\r\nvery frequently, parched by a thirst which all this water could not\r\nquench.\r\n\r\nOn the seventh day Catherine was bending down to drink, when her hand\r\nstruck some floating body before her.\r\n\r\n"I say, look! What\'s this?"\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne felt in the darkness.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t make out; it seems like the cover of a ventilation door."\r\n\r\nShe drank, but as she was drawing up a second mouthful the body came\r\nback, striking her hand. And she uttered a terrible cry.\r\n\r\n"My God! it\'s he!"\r\n\r\n"Whom do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"Him! You know well enough. I felt his moustache."\r\n\r\nIt was Chaval\'s corpse, risen from the upbrow and pushed on to them by\r\nthe flow. \xc3\x89tienne stretched out his arm; he, too, felt the moustache\r\nand the crushed nose, and shuddered with disgust and fear. Seized by\r\nhorrible nausea, Catherine had spat out the water which was still in\r\nher mouth. It seemed to her that she had been drinking blood, and that\r\nall the deep water before her was now that man\'s blood.\r\n\r\n"Wait!" stammered \xc3\x89tienne. "I\'ll push him off!"\r\n\r\nHe kicked the corpse, which moved off. But soon they felt it again\r\nstriking against their legs.\r\n\r\n"By God! Get off!"\r\n\r\nAnd the third time \xc3\x89tienne had to leave it. Some current always brought\r\nit back. Chaval would not go; he desired to be with them, against them.\r\nIt was an awful companion, at last poisoning the air. All that day they\r\nnever drank, struggling, preferring to die. It was not until the next\r\nday that their suffering decided them: they pushed away the body at\r\neach mouthful and drank in spite of it. It had not been worth while to\r\nknock his brains out, for he came back between him and her, obstinate\r\nin his jealousy. To the very end he would be there, even though he was\r\ndead, preventing them from coming together.\r\n\r\nA day passed, and again another day. At every shiver of the water\r\n\xc3\x89tienne perceived a slight blow from the man he had killed, the simple\r\nelbowing of a neighbour who is reminding you of his presence. And\r\nevery time it came he shuddered. He continually saw it there, swollen,\r\ngreenish, with the red moustache and the crushed face. Then he no\r\nlonger remembered; he had not killed him; the other man was swimming\r\nand trying to bite him.\r\n\r\nCatherine was now shaken by long endless fits of crying, after which\r\nshe was completely prostrated. She fell at last into a condition of\r\nirresistible drowsiness. He would arouse her, but she stammered a few\r\nwords and at once fell asleep again without even raising her eyelids;\r\nand fearing lest she should be drowned, he put his arm round her waist.\r\nIt was he now who replied to the mates. The blows of the pick were now\r\napproaching, he could hear them behind his back. But his strength, too,\r\nwas diminishing; he had lost all courage to strike. They were known to\r\nbe there; why weary oneself more? It no longer interested him whether\r\nthey came or not. In the stupefaction of waiting he would forget for\r\nhours at a time what he was waiting for.\r\n\r\nOne relief comforted them a little: the water sank, and Chaval\'s\r\nbody moved off. For nine days the work of their deliverance had been\r\ngoing on, and they were for the first time taking a few steps in the\r\ngallery when a fearful commotion threw them to the ground. They felt\r\nfor each other and remained in each other\'s arms like mad people, not\r\nunderstanding, thinking the catastrophe was beginning over again.\r\nNothing more stirred, the sound of the picks had ceased.\r\n\r\nIn the corner where they were seated holding each other, side by side,\r\na low laugh came from Catherine.\r\n\r\n"It must be good outside. Come, let\'s go out of here."\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne at first struggled against this madness. But the contagion was\r\nshaking his stronger head, and he lost the exact sensation of reality.\r\nAll their senses seemed to go astray, especially Catherine\'s. She\r\nwas shaken by fever, tormented now by the need to talk and move. The\r\nringing in her ears had become the murmur of flowing water, the song\r\nof birds; she smelled the strong odour of crushed grass, and could see\r\nclearly great yellow patches floating before her eyes, so large that\r\nshe thought she was out of doors, near the canal, in the meadows on a\r\nfine summer day.\r\n\r\n"Eh? how warm it is! Take me, then; let us keep together. Oh, always,\r\nalways!"\r\n\r\nHe pressed her, and she rubbed herself against him for a long time,\r\ncontinuing to chatter like a happy girl:\r\n\r\n"How silly we have been to wait so long! I would have liked you at\r\nonce, and you did not understand; you sulked. Then, do you remember,\r\nat our house at night, when we could not sleep, with our faces out\r\nlistening to each other\'s breathing, with such a longing to come\r\ntogether?"\r\n\r\nHe was won by her gaiety, and joked over the recollection of their\r\nsilent tenderness.\r\n\r\n"You struck me once. Yes, yes, blows on both cheeks!"\r\n\r\n"It was because I loved you," she murmured. "You see, I prevented\r\nmyself from thinking of you. I said to myself that it was quite done\r\nwith, and all the time I knew that one day or another we should get\r\ntogether. It only wanted an opportunity--some lucky chance. Wasn\'t it\r\nso?"\r\n\r\nA shudder froze him. He tried to shake off this dream; then he repeated\r\nslowly:\r\n\r\n"Nothing is ever done with; a little happiness is enough to make\r\neverything begin again."\r\n\r\n"Then you\'ll keep me, and it will be all right this time?"\r\n\r\nAnd she slipped down fainting. She was so weak that her low voice died\r\nout. In terror he kept her against his heart.\r\n\r\n"Are you in pain?"\r\n\r\nShe sat up surprised.\r\n\r\n"No, not at all. Why?"\r\n\r\nBut this question aroused her from her dream. She gazed at the darkness\r\nwith distraction, wringing her hands in another fit of sobbing.\r\n\r\n"My God, my God, how black it is!"\r\n\r\nIt was no longer the meadows, the odour of the grass, the song of\r\nlarks, the great yellow sun; it was the fallen, inundated mine, the\r\nstinking gloom, the melancholy dripping of this cellar where they had\r\nbeen groaning for so many days. Her perverted senses now increased the\r\nhorror of it; her childish superstitions came back to her; she saw the\r\nBlack Man, the old dead miner who returns to the pit to twist naughty\r\ngirls\' necks.\r\n\r\n"Listen! did you hear?"\r\n\r\n"No, nothing; I heard nothing."\r\n\r\n"Yes, the Man--you know? Look! he is there. The earth has let all the\r\nblood out of the vein to revenge itself for being cut into; and he is\r\nthere--you can see him--look! blacker than night. Oh, I\'m so afraid,\r\nI\'m so afraid!"\r\n\r\nShe became silent, shivering. Then in a very low voice she whispered:\r\n\r\n"No, it\'s always the other one."\r\n\r\n"What other one?"\r\n\r\n"Him who is with us; who is not alive."\r\n\r\nThe image of Chaval haunted her, she talked of him confusedly, she\r\ndescribed the dog\'s life she led with him, the only day when he had\r\nbeen kind to her at Jean-Bart, the other days of follies and blows,\r\nwhen he would kill her with caresses after having covered her with\r\nkicks.\r\n\r\n"I tell you that he\'s coming, that he will still keep us from being\r\ntogether! His jealousy is coming on him again. Oh, push him off! Oh,\r\nkeep me close!"\r\n\r\nWith a sudden impulse she hung on to him, seeking his mouth and\r\npressing her own passionately to it. The darkness lighted up, she saw\r\nthe sun again, and she laughed a quiet laugh of love. He shuddered to\r\nfeel her thus against his flesh, half naked beneath the tattered jacket\r\nand trousers, and he seized her with a reawakening of his virility. It\r\nwas at length their wedding night, at the bottom of this tomb, on this\r\nbed of mud, the longing not to die before they had had their happiness,\r\nthe obstinate longing to live and make life one last time. They loved\r\neach other in despair of everything, in death.\r\n\r\nAfter that there was nothing more. \xc3\x89tienne was seated on the ground,\r\nalways in the same corner, and Catherine was lying motionless on his\r\nknees. Hours and hours passed by. For a long time he thought she was\r\nsleeping; then he touched her; she was very cold, she was dead. He did\r\nnot move, however, for fear of arousing her. The idea that he was the\r\nfirst who had possessed her as a woman, and that she might be pregnant,\r\nfilled him with tenderness. Other ideas, the desire to go away with\r\nher, joy at what they would both do later on, came to him at moments,\r\nbut so vaguely that it seemed only as though his forehead had been\r\ntouched by a breath of sleep. He grew weaker, he only had strength to\r\nmake a little gesture, a slow movement of the hand, to assure himself\r\nthat she was certainly there, like a sleeping child in her frozen\r\nstiffness. Everything was being annihilated; the night itself had\r\ndisappeared, and he was nowhere, out of space, out of time. Something\r\nwas certainly striking beside his head, violent blows were approaching\r\nhim; but he had been too lazy to reply, benumbed by immense fatigue;\r\nand now he knew nothing, he only dreamed that she was walking before\r\nhim, and that he heard the slight clank of her sabots. Two days passed;\r\nshe had not stirred; he touched her with his mechanical gesture,\r\nreassured to find her so quiet.\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne felt a shock. Voices were sounding, rocks were rolling to his\r\nfeet. When he perceived a lamp he wept. His blinking eyes followed the\r\nlight, he was never tired of looking at it, enraptured by this reddish\r\npoint which scarcely stained the darkness. But some mates carried him\r\naway, and he allowed them to introduce some spoonfuls of soup between\r\nhis clenched teeth. It was only in the R\xc3\xa9quillart gallery that he\r\nrecognized someone standing before him, the engineer, N\xc3\xa9grel; and these\r\ntwo men, with their contempt for each other--the rebellious workman and\r\nthe sceptical master--threw themselves on each other\'s necks, sobbing\r\nloudly in the deep upheaval of all the humanity within them. It was an\r\nimmense sadness, the misery of generations, the extremity of grief into\r\nwhich life can fall.\r\n\r\nAt the surface, Maheude, stricken down near dead Catherine, uttered\r\na cry, then another, then another--very long, deep, incessant moans.\r\nSeveral corpses had already been brought up, and placed in a row on\r\nthe ground: Chaval, who was thought to have been crushed beneath a\r\nlandslip, a trammer, and two hewers, also crushed, with brainless\r\nskulls and bellies swollen with water. Women in the crowd went out of\r\ntheir minds, tearing their skirts and scratching their faces. When\r\n\xc3\x89tienne was at last taken out, after having been accustomed to the\r\nlamps and fed a little, he appeared fleshless, and his hair was quite\r\nwhite. People turned away and shuddered at this old man. Maheude left\r\noff crying to stare at him stupidly with her large fixed eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was four o\'clock in the morning, and the fresh April night was\r\ngrowing warm at the approach of day. In the limpid sky the stars were\r\ntwinkling out, while the east grew purple with dawn. And a slight\r\nshudder passed over the drowsy black country, the vague rumour which\r\nprecedes awakening.\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne, with long strides, was following the Vandame road. He had\r\njust passed six weeks at Montsou, in bed at the hospital. Though very\r\nthin and yellow, he felt strength to go, and he went. The Company,\r\nstill trembling for its pits, was constantly sending men away, and had\r\ngiven him notice that he could not be kept on. He was offered the sum\r\nof one hundred francs, with the paternal advice to leave off working\r\nin mines, as it would now be too severe for him. But he refused the\r\nhundred francs. He had already received a letter from Pluchart, calling\r\nhim to Paris, and enclosing money for the journey. His old dream would\r\nbe realized. The night before, on leaving the hospital, he had slept at\r\nthe Bon-Joyeux, Widow D\xc3\xa9sir\'s. And he rose early; only one desire was\r\nleft, to bid his mates farewell before taking the eight o\'clock train\r\nat Marchiennes.\r\n\r\nFor a moment \xc3\x89tienne stopped on the road, which was now becoming\r\nrose-coloured. It was good to breathe that pure air of the precocious\r\nspring. It would turn out a superb day. The sun was slowly rising, and\r\nthe life of the earth was rising with it. And he set out walking again,\r\nvigorously striking with his brier stick, watching the plain afar, as\r\nit rose from the vapours of the night. He had seen no one; Maheude had\r\ncome once to the hospital, and, probably, had not been able to come\r\nagain. But he knew that the whole settlement of the Deux-Cent-Quarante\r\nwas now going down at Jean-Bart, and that she too had taken work there.\r\n\r\nLittle by little the deserted roads were peopled, and colliers\r\nconstantly passed \xc3\x89tienne with pallid, silent faces. The Company,\r\npeople said, was abusing its victory. After two and a half months\r\nof strike, when they had returned to the pits, conquered by hunger,\r\nthey had been obliged to accept the timbering tariff, that disguised\r\ndecrease in wages, now the more hateful because stained with the\r\nblood of their mates. They were being robbed of an hour\'s work, they\r\nwere being made false to their oath never to submit; and this imposed\r\nperjury stuck in their throats like gall. Work was beginning again\r\neverywhere, at Mirou, at Madeleine, at Cr\xc3\xa9vecoeur, at the Victoire.\r\nEverywhere, in the morning haze, along the roads lost in darkness, the\r\nflock was tramping on, rows of men trotting with faces bent towards the\r\nearth, like cattle led to the slaughter-house. They shivered beneath\r\ntheir thin garments, folding their arms, rolling their hips, expanding\r\ntheir backs with the humps formed by the brick between the shirt\r\nand the jacket. And in this wholesale return to work, in these mute\r\nshadows, all black, without a laugh, without a look aside, one felt\r\nthe teeth clenched with rage, the hearts swollen with hatred, a simple\r\nresignation to the necessity of the belly.\r\n\r\nThe nearer \xc3\x89tienne approached the pit the more their number increased.\r\nThey nearly all walked alone; those who came in groups were in single\r\nfile, already exhausted, tired of one another and of themselves. He\r\nnoticed one who was very old, with eyes that shone like hot coals\r\nbeneath his livid forehead. Another, a young man, was panting with the\r\nrestrained fury of a storm. Many had their sabots in their hands; one\r\ncould scarcely hear the soft sound of their coarse woollen stockings on\r\nthe ground. It was an endless rustling, a general downfall, the forced\r\nmarch of a beaten army, moving on with lowered heads, sullenly absorbed\r\nin the desire to renew the struggle and achieve revenge.\r\n\r\nWhen \xc3\x89tienne arrived, Jean-Bart was emerging from the shade; the\r\nlanterns, hooked on to the platform, were still burning in the\r\ngrowing dawn. Above the obscure buildings a trail of steam arose\r\nlike a white plume delicately tinted with carmine. He passed up\r\nthe sifting-staircase to go to the receiving-room. The descent was\r\nbeginning, and the men were coming from the shed. For a moment he stood\r\nby, motionless amid the noise and movement. The rolling of the trams\r\nshook the metal floor, the drums were turning, unrolling the cables in\r\nthe midst of cries from the trumpet, the ringing of bells, blows of\r\nthe mallet on the signal block; he found the monster again swallowing\r\nhis daily ration of human flesh, the cages rising and plunging,\r\nengulfing their burden of men, without ceasing, with the facile gulp of\r\na voracious giant. Since his accident he had a nervous horror of the\r\nmine. The cages, as they sank down, tore his bowels. He had to turn\r\naway his head; the pit exasperated him.\r\n\r\nBut in the vast and still sombre hall, feebly lighted up by the\r\nexhausted lanterns, he could perceive no friendly face. The miners,\r\nwho were waiting there with bare feet and their lamps in their hands,\r\nlooked at him with large restless eyes, and then lowered their faces,\r\ndrawing back with an air of shame. No doubt they knew him and no longer\r\nhad any spite against him; they seemed, on the contrary, to fear him,\r\nblushing at the thought that he would reproach them with cowardice.\r\nThis attitude made his heart swell; he forgot that these wretches had\r\nstoned him, he again began to dream of changing them into heroes, of\r\ndirecting a whole people, this force of nature which was devouring\r\nitself. A cage was embarking its men, and the batch disappeared; as\r\nothers arrived he saw at last one of his lieutenants in the strike, a\r\nworthy fellow who had sworn to die.\r\n\r\n"You too!" he murmured, with aching heart.\r\n\r\nThe other turned pale and his lips trembled; then, with a movement of\r\nexcuse:\r\n\r\n"What would you have? I\'ve got a wife."\r\n\r\nNow in the new crowd coming from the shed he recognized them all.\r\n\r\n"You too!--you too!--you too!"\r\n\r\nAnd all shrank back, stammering in choked voices:\r\n\r\n"I have a mother."--"I have children."--"One must get bread."\r\n\r\nThe cage did not reappear; they waited for it mournfully, with such\r\nsorrow at their defeat that they avoided meeting each other\'s eyes,\r\nobstinately gazing at the shaft.\r\n\r\n"And Maheude?" \xc3\x89tienne asked.\r\n\r\nThey made no reply. One made a sign that she was coming. Others raised\r\ntheir arms, trembling with pity. Ah, poor woman! what wretchedness!\r\nThe silence continued, and when \xc3\x89tienne stretched out his hand to bid\r\nthem farewell, they all pressed it vigorously, putting into that mute\r\nsqueeze their rage at having yielded, their feverish hope of revenge.\r\nThe cage was there; they got into it and sank, devoured by the gulf.\r\n\r\nPierron had appeared with his naked captain\'s lamp fixed into the\r\nleather of his cap. For the past week he had been chief of the gang\r\nat the pit-eye, and the men moved away, for promotion had rendered\r\nhim bossy. The sight of \xc3\x89tienne annoyed him; he came up, however, and\r\nwas at last reassured when the young man announced his departure.\r\nThey talked. His wife now kept the Estaminet du Progr\xc3\xa9s, thanks to\r\nthe support of all those gentlemen, who had been so good to her. But\r\nhe interrupted himself and turned furiously on to Father Mouque,\r\nwhom he accused of not sending up the dung-heap from his stable at\r\nthe regulation hour. The old man listened with bent shoulders. Then,\r\nbefore going down, suffering from this reprimand, he, too, gave his\r\nhand to \xc3\x89tienne, with the same long pressure as the others, warm with\r\nrestrained anger and quivering with future rebellion. And this old hand\r\nwhich trembled in his, this old man who was forgiving him for the loss\r\nof his dead children, affected \xc3\x89tienne to such a degree that he watched\r\nhim disappear without saying a word.\r\n\r\n"Then Maheude is not coming this morning?" he asked Pierron after a\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nAt first the latter pretended not to understand, for there was ill luck\r\neven in speaking of her. Then, as he moved away, under the pretext of\r\ngiving an order, he said at last:\r\n\r\n"Eh! Maheude? There she is."\r\n\r\nIn fact, Maheude had reached the shed with her lamp in her hand,\r\ndressed in trousers and jacket, with her head confined in the cap. It\r\nwas by a charitable exception that the Company, pitying the fate of\r\nthis unhappy woman, so cruelly afflicted, had allowed her to go down\r\nagain at the age of forty; and as it seemed difficult to set her again\r\nat haulage work, she was employed to manipulate a small ventilator\r\nwhich had been installed in the north gallery, in those infernal\r\nregions beneath Tartaret, where there was no movement of air. For\r\nten hours, with aching back, she turned her wheel at the bottom of a\r\nburning tube, baked by forty degrees of heat. She earned thirty sous.\r\n\r\nWhen \xc3\x89tienne saw her, a pitiful sight in her male garments--her breast\r\nand belly seeming to be swollen by the dampness of the cuttings--he\r\nstammered with surprise, trying to find words to explain that he was\r\ngoing away and that he wished to say good-bye to her.\r\n\r\nShe looked at him without listening, and said at last, speaking\r\nfamiliarly:\r\n\r\n"Eh? it surprises you to see me. It\'s true enough that I threatened to\r\nwring the neck of the first of my children who went down again; and now\r\nthat I\'m going down I ought to wring my own, ought I not? Ah, well! I\r\nshould have done it by now if it hadn\'t been for the old man and the\r\nlittle ones at the house."\r\n\r\nAnd she went on in her low, fatigued voice. She did not excuse herself,\r\nshe simply narrated things--that they had been nearly starved, and that\r\nshe had made up her mind to it, so that they might not be sent away\r\nfrom the settlement.\r\n\r\n"How is the old man?" asked \xc3\x89tienne.\r\n\r\n"He is always very gentle and very clean. But he is quite off his nut.\r\nHe was not brought up for that affair, you know. There was talk of\r\nshutting him up with the madmen, but I was not willing; they would have\r\ndone for him in his soup. His story has, all the same, been very bad\r\nfor us, for he\'ll never get his pension; one of those gentlemen told me\r\nthat it would be immoral to give him one."\r\n\r\n"Is Jeanlin working?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, those gentlemen found something for him to do at the top. He gets\r\ntwenty sous. Oh! I don\'t complain; the bosses have been very good, as\r\nthey told me themselves. The brat\'s twenty sous and my thirty, that\r\nmakes fifty. If there were not six of us we should get enough to eat.\r\nEstelle devours now, and the worst is that it will be four or five\r\nyears before L\xc3\xa9nore and Henri are old enough to come to the pit."\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne could not restrain a movement of pain.\r\n\r\n"They, too!"\r\n\r\nMaheude\'s pale cheeks turned red, and her eyes flamed. But her\r\nshoulders sank as if beneath the weight of destiny.\r\n\r\n"What would you have? They after the others. They have all been done\r\nfor there; now it\'s their turn."\r\n\r\nShe was silent; some landers, who were rolling trams, disturbed them.\r\nThrough the large dusty windows the early sun was entering, drowning\r\nthe lanterns in grey light; and the engine moved every three minutes,\r\nthe cables unrolled, the cages continued to swallow down men.\r\n\r\n"Come along, you loungers, look sharp!" shouted Pierron. "Get in; we\r\nshall never have done with it today."\r\n\r\nMaheude, whom he was looking at, did not stir. She had already allowed\r\nthree cages to pass, and she said, as though arousing herself and\r\nremembering \xc3\x89tienne\'s first words:\r\n\r\n"Then you\'re going away?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, this morning."\r\n\r\n"You\'re right; better be somewhere else if one can. And I\'m glad to\r\nhave seen you, because you can know now, anyhow, that I\'ve nothing on\r\nmy mind against you. For a moment I could have killed you, after all\r\nthat slaughter. But one thinks, doesn\'t one? One sees that when all\'s\r\nreckoned up it\'s nobody\'s fault. No, no! it\'s not your fault; it\'s the\r\nfault of everybody."\r\n\r\nNow she talked with tranquillity of her dead, of her man, of Zacharie,\r\nof Catherine; and tears only came into her eyes when she uttered\r\nAlzire\'s name. She had resumed her calm reasonableness, and judged\r\nthings sensibly. It would bring no luck to the middle class to have\r\nkilled so many poor people. Sure enough, they would be punished for it\r\none day, for everything has to be paid for. There would even be no need\r\nto interfere; the whole thing would explode by itself. The soldiers\r\nwould fire on the masters just as they had fired on the men. And in her\r\neverlasting resignation, in that hereditary discipline under which she\r\nwas again bowing, a conviction had established itself, the certainty\r\nthat injustice could not last longer, and that, if there were no good\r\nGod left, another would spring up to avenge the wretched.\r\n\r\nShe spoke in a low voice, with suspicious glances round. Then, as\r\nPierron was coming up, she added, aloud:\r\n\r\n"Well, if you\'re going, you must take your things from our house. There\r\nare still two shirts, three handkerchiefs, and an old pair of trousers."\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne, with a gesture, refused these few things saved from the\r\ndealers.\r\n\r\n"No, it\'s not worth while; they can be for the children. At Paris I can\r\narrange for myself."\r\n\r\nTwo more cages had gone down, and Pierron decided to speak straight to\r\nMaheude.\r\n\r\n"I say now, over there, they are waiting for you! Is that little chat\r\nnearly done?"\r\n\r\nBut she turned her back. Why should he be so zealous, this man who\r\nhad sold himself? The descent didn\'t concern him. His men hated him\r\nenough already on his level. And she persisted, with her lamp in her\r\nhand, frozen amid the draughts in spite of the mildness of the season.\r\nNeither \xc3\x89tienne nor she found anything more to say. They remained\r\nfacing each other with hearts so full that they would have liked to\r\nspeak once more.\r\n\r\nAt last she spoke for the sake of speaking.\r\n\r\n"The Levaque is in the family way. Levaque is still in prison;\r\nBouteloup is taking his place meanwhile."\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes! Bouteloup."\r\n\r\n"And, listen! did I tell you? Philom\xc3\xa9ne has gone away."\r\n\r\n"What! gone away?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, gone away with a Pas-de-Calais miner. I was afraid she would\r\nleave the two brats on me. But no, she took them with her. Eh? A woman\r\nwho spits blood and always looks as if she were on the point of death!"\r\n\r\nShe mused for a moment, and then went on in a slow voice:\r\n\r\n"There\'s been talk on my account. You remember they said I slept with\r\nyou. Lord! After my man\'s death that might very well have happened if\r\nI had been younger. But now I\'m glad it wasn\'t so, for we should have\r\nregretted it, sure enough."\r\n\r\n"Yes, we should have regretted it," \xc3\x89tienne repeated, simply.\r\n\r\nThat was all; they spoke no more. A cage was waiting for her; she was\r\nbeing called angrily, threatened with a fine. Then she made up her\r\nmind, and pressed his hand. Deeply moved, he still looked at her, so\r\nworn and worked out, with her livid face, her discoloured hair escaping\r\nfrom the blue cap, her body as of a good over-fruitful beast, deformed\r\nbeneath the jacket and trousers. And in this last pressure of the\r\nhands he felt again the long, silent pressure of his mates, giving him\r\na rendezvous for the day when they would begin again. He understood\r\nperfectly. There was a tranquil faith in the depths of her eyes. It\r\nwould be soon, and this time it would be the final blow.\r\n\r\n"What a damned shammer!" exclaimed Pierron.\r\n\r\nPushed and hustled, Maheude squeezed into a tram with four others. The\r\nsignal-cord was drawn to strike for meat, the cage was unhooked and\r\nfell into the night, and there was nothing more but the rapid flight of\r\nthe cable.\r\n\r\nThen \xc3\x89tienne left the pit. Below, beneath the screening-shed, he\r\nnoticed a creature seated on the earth, with legs stretched out, in the\r\nmidst of a thick pile of coal. It was Jeanlin, who was employed there\r\nto clean the large coal. He held a block of coal between his thighs,\r\nand freed it with a hammer from the fragments of slate. A fine powder\r\ndrowned him in such a flood of soot that the young man would never have\r\nrecognized him if the child had not lifted his ape-like face, with the\r\nprotruding ears and small greenish eyes. He laughed, with a joking air,\r\nand, giving a final blow to the block, disappeared in the black dust\r\nwhich arose.\r\n\r\nOutside, \xc3\x89tienne followed the road for a while, absorbed in his\r\nthoughts. All sorts of ideas were buzzing in his head. But he felt the\r\nopen air, the free sky, and he breathed deeply. The sun was appearing\r\nin glory at the horizon, there was a reawakening of gladness over the\r\nwhole country. A flood of gold rolled from the east to the west on\r\nthe immense plain. This heat of life was expanding and extending in a\r\ntremor of youth, in which vibrated the sighs of the earth, the song of\r\nbirds, all the murmuring sounds of the waters and the woods. It was\r\ngood to live, and the old world wanted to live through one more spring.\r\n\r\nAnd penetrated by that hope, \xc3\x89tienne slackened his walk, his eyes\r\nwandering to right and to left amid the gaiety of the new season. He\r\nthought about himself, he felt himself strong, seasoned by his hard\r\nexperiences at the bottom of the mine. His education was complete, he\r\nwas going away armed, a rational soldier of the revolution, having\r\ndeclared war against society as he saw it and as he condemned it. The\r\njoy of rejoining Pluchart and of being, like Pluchart, a leader who was\r\nlistened to, inspired him with speeches, and he began to arrange the\r\nphrases. He was meditating an enlarged programme; that middle-class\r\nrefinement, which had raised him above his class, had deepened his\r\nhatred of the middle class. He felt the need of glorifying these\r\nworkers, whose odour of wretchedness was now unpleasant to him; he\r\nwould show that they alone were great and stainless, the only nobility\r\nand the only strength in which humanity could be dipped afresh. He\r\nalready saw himself in the tribune, triumphing with the people, if the\r\npeople did not devour him.\r\n\r\nThe loud song of a lark made him look up towards the sky. Little red\r\nclouds, the last vapours of the night, were melting in the limpid\r\nblue; and the vague faces of Souvarine and Rasseneur came to his\r\nmemory. Decidedly, all was spoilt when each man tried to get power\r\nfor himself. Thus that famous International which was to have renewed\r\nthe world had impotently miscarried, and its formidable army had been\r\ncut up and crumbled away from internal dissensions. Was Darwin right,\r\nthen, and the world only a battlefield, where the strong ate the weak\r\nfor the sake of the beauty and continuance of the race? This question\r\ntroubled him, although he settled it like a man who is satisfied\r\nwith his knowledge. But one idea dissipated his doubts and enchanted\r\nhim--that of taking up his old explanation of the theory the first time\r\nthat he should speak. If any class must be devoured, would not the\r\npeople, still new and full of life, devour the middle class, exhausted\r\nby enjoyment? The new society would arise from new blood. And in this\r\nexpectation of an invasion of barbarians, regenerating the old decayed\r\nnations, reappeared his absolute faith in an approaching revolution,\r\nthe real one--that of the workers--the fire of which would inflame this\r\ncentury\'s end with that purple of the rising sun which he saw like\r\nblood on the sky.\r\n\r\nHe still walked, dreaming, striking his brier stick against the flints\r\non the road, and when he glanced around him he recognized the various\r\nplaces. Just there, at the Fourche-aux-Boeufs, he remembered that he\r\nhad taken command of the band that morning when the pits were sacked.\r\nToday the brutish, deathly, ill-paid work was beginning over again.\r\nBeneath the earth, down there at seven hundred metres, it seemed to him\r\nhe heard low, regular, continuous blows; it was the men he had just\r\nseen go down, the black workers, who were hammering in their silent\r\nrage. No doubt they were beaten. They had left their dead and their\r\nmoney on the field; but Paris would not forget the volleys fired at\r\nthe Voreux, and the blood of the empire, too, would flow from that\r\nincurable wound. And if the industrial crisis was drawing to an end,\r\nif the workshops were opening again one by one, a state of war was\r\nno less declared, and peace was henceforth impossible. The colliers\r\nhad reckoned up their men; they had tried their strength, with their\r\ncry for justice arousing the workers all over France. Their defeat,\r\ntherefore, reassured no one. The Montsou bourgeois, in their victory,\r\nfelt the vague uneasiness that arises on the morrow of a strike,\r\nlooking behind them to see if their end did not lie inevitably over\r\nthere, in spite of all beyond that great silence. They understood that\r\nthe revolution would be born again unceasingly, perhaps to-morrow,\r\nwith a general strike--the common understanding of all workers having\r\ngeneral funds, and so able to hold out for months, eating their own\r\nbread. This time a push only had been given to a ruinous society, but\r\nthey had heard the rumbling beneath their feet, and they felt more\r\nshocks arising, and still more, until the old edifice would be crushed,\r\nfallen in and swallowed, going down like the Voreux to the abyss.\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89tienne took the Joiselle road, to the left. He remembered that he had\r\nprevented the band from rushing on to Gaston-Marie. Afar, in the clear\r\nsky he saw the steeples of several pits--Mirou to the right, Madeleine\r\nand Cr\xc3\xa9vecoeur side by side. Work was going on everywhere; he seemed\r\nto be able to catch the blows of the pick at the bottom of the earth,\r\nstriking now from one end of the plain to the other, one blow, and\r\nanother blow, and yet more blows, beneath the fields and roads and\r\nvillages which were laughing in the light, all the obscure labour of\r\nthe underground prison, so crushed by the enormous mass of the rocks\r\nthat one had to know it was underneath there to distinguish its great\r\npainful sigh. And he now thought that, perhaps, violence would not\r\nhasten things. Cutting cables, tearing up rails, breaking lamps, what a\r\nuseless task it was! It was not worth while for three thousand men to\r\nrush about in a devastating band doing that. He vaguely divined that\r\nlawful methods might one day be more terrible. His reason was ripening,\r\nhe had sown the wild oats of his spite. Yes, Maheude had well said,\r\nwith her good sense, that that would be the great blow--to organize\r\nquietly, to know one another, to unite in associations when the laws\r\nwould permit it; then, on the morning when they felt their strength,\r\nand millions of workers would be face to face with a few thousand\r\nidlers, to take the power into their own hands and become the masters.\r\nAh! what a reawakening of truth and justice! The sated and crouching\r\ngod would at once get his death-blow, the monstrous idol hidden in the\r\ndepths of his sanctuary, in that unknown distance where poor wretches\r\nfed him with their flesh without ever having seen him.\r\n\r\nBut \xc3\x89tienne, leaving the Vandame road, now came on to the paved street.\r\nOn the right he saw Montsou, which was lost in the valley. Opposite\r\nwere the ruins of the Voreux, the accursed hole where three pumps\r\nworked unceasingly. Then there were the other pits at the horizon, the\r\nVictoire, Saint-Thomas, Feutry-Cantel; while, towards the north, the\r\ntall chimneys of the blast furnaces, and the batteries of coke ovens,\r\nwere smoking in the transparent morning air. If he was not to lose the\r\neight o\'clock train he must hasten, for he had still six kilometres\r\nbefore him.\r\n\r\nAnd beneath his feet, the deep blows, those obstinate blows of the\r\npick, continued. The mates were all there; he heard them following him\r\nat every stride. Was not that Maheude beneath the beetroots, with bent\r\nback and hoarse respiration accompanying the rumble of the ventilator?\r\nTo left, to right, farther on, he seemed to recognize others beneath\r\nthe wheatfields, the hedges, the young trees. Now the April sun, in the\r\nopen sky, was shining in his glory, and warming the pregnant earth.\r\nFrom its fertile flanks life was leaping out, buds were bursting into\r\ngreen leaves, and the fields were quivering with the growth of the\r\ngrass. On every side seeds were swelling, stretching out, cracking the\r\nplain, filled by the need of heat and light. An overflow of sap was\r\nmixed with whispering voices, the sound of the germs expanding in a\r\ngreat kiss. Again and again, more and more distinctly, as though they\r\nwere approaching the soil, the mates were hammering. In the fiery rays\r\nof the sun on this youthful morning the country seemed full of that\r\nsound. Men were springing forth, a black avenging army, germinating\r\nslowly in the furrows, growing towards the harvests of the next\r\ncentury, and their germination would soon overturn the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK GERMINAL ***\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
