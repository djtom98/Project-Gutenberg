The first is to rescue the work from an edition illustrated\r\nwithout the author\xe2\x80\x99s sanction, and so unsuitably that all lovers of the\r\nbook must have experienced some real grief in turning its pages. With\r\nthe copyright I secured also the whole of that edition and turned it\r\ninto pulp.\r\n\r\nMy second reason is to pay a small tribute to my father by way of\r\npersonal gratitude for this, his first prose work, which was published\r\nnearly fifty years ago. Though unknown to many lovers of his greater\r\nwritings, none of these has exceeded it in imaginative insight and\r\npower of expression. To me it rings with the dominant chord of his\r\nlife\xe2\x80\x99s purpose and work.\r\n\r\nMy third reason is that wider knowledge and love of the book should be\r\nmade possible. To this end I have been most happy in the help of my\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s old friend, who has illustrated the book. I know of no other\r\nliving artist who is capable of portraying the spirit of Phantastes;\r\nand every reader of this edition will, I believe, feel that the\r\nillustrations are a part of the romance, and will gain through them\r\nsome perception of the brotherhood between George MacDonald and Arthur\r\nHughes.\r\n\r\nGREVILLE MACDONALD.\r\n\r\nSeptember 1905.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPHANTASTES`\r\nA FAERIE ROMANCE\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPhantastes from \xe2\x80\x98their fount\xe2\x80\x99 all shapes deriving,\r\nIn new habiliments can quickly dight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nFLETCHER\xe2\x80\x99S _Purple Island_\r\n\r\n\r\nEs lassen sich Erz\xc3\xa4hlungen ohne Zusammenhang, jedoch mit Association,\r\nwie Tr\xc3\xa4ume, denken; Gedichte, die bloss wohlklingend und voll sch\xc3\xb6ner\r\nWorte sind, aber auch ohne allen Sinn und Zusammenhang, h\xc3\xb6chstens\r\neinzelne Strophen verst\xc3\xa4ndlich, wie Bruchst\xc3\xbccke aus den\r\nverschiedenartigsten Dingen.

As I lay and looked through the eastern\r\nwindow of my room, a faint streak of peach-colour, dividing a cloud\r\nthat just rose above the low swell of the horizon, announced the\r\napproach of the sun. As my thoughts, which a deep and apparently\r\ndreamless sleep had dissolved, began again to assume crystalline forms,\r\nthe strange events of the foregoing night presented themselves anew to\r\nmy wondering consciousness. The day before had been my\r\none-and-twentieth birthday. Among other ceremonies investing me with my\r\nlegal rights, the keys of an old secretary, in which my father had kept\r\nhis private papers, had been delivered up to me. As soon as I was left\r\nalone, I ordered lights in the chamber where the secretary stood, the\r\nfirst lights that had been there for many a year; for, since my\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s death, the room had been left undisturbed. But, as if the\r\ndarkness had been too long an inmate to be easily expelled, and had\r\ndyed with blackness the walls to which, bat-like, it had clung, these\r\ntapers served but ill to light up the gloomy hangings, and seemed to\r\nthrow yet darker shadows into the hollows of the deep-wrought cornice.\r\nAll the further portions of the room lay shrouded in a mystery whose\r\ndeepest folds were gathered around the dark oak cabinet which I now\r\napproached with a strange mingling of reverence and curiosity. Perhaps,\r\nlike a geologist, I was about to turn up to the light some of the\r\nburied strata of the human world, with its fossil remains charred by\r\npassion and petrified by tears. Perhaps I was to learn how my father,\r\nwhose personal history was unknown to me, had woven his web of story;\r\nhow he had found the world, and how the world had left him. Perhaps I\r\nwas to find only the records of lands and moneys, how gotten and how\r\nsecured; coming down from strange men, and through troublous times, to\r\nme, who knew little or nothing of them all. To solve my speculations,\r\nand to dispel the awe which was fast gathering around me as if the dead\r\nwere drawing near, I approached the secretary; and having found the key\r\nthat fitted the upper portion, I opened it with some difficulty, drew\r\nnear it a heavy high-backed chair, and sat down before a multitude of\r\nlittle drawers and slides and pigeon-holes. But the door of a little\r\ncupboard in the centre especially attracted my interest, as if there\r\nlay the secret of this long-hidden world. Its key I found.\r\n\r\nOne of the rusty hinges cracked and broke as I opened the door: it\r\nrevealed a number of small pigeon-holes. These, however, being but\r\nshallow compared with the depth of those around the little cupboard,\r\nthe outer ones reaching to the back of the desk, I concluded that there\r\nmust be some accessible space behind; and found, indeed, that they were\r\nformed in a separate framework, which admitted of the whole being\r\npulled out in one piece. Behind, I found a sort of flexible portcullis\r\nof small bars of wood laid close together horizontally. After long\r\nsearch, and trying many ways to move it, I discovered at last a\r\nscarcely projecting point of steel on one side. I pressed this\r\nrepeatedly and hard with the point of an old tool that was lying near,\r\ntill at length it yielded inwards; and the little slide, flying up\r\nsuddenly, disclosed a chamber\xe2\x80\x94empty, except that in one corner lay a\r\nlittle heap of withered rose-leaves, whose long-lived scent had long\r\nsince departed; and, in another, a small packet of papers, tied with a\r\nbit of ribbon, whose colour had gone with the rose-scent. Almost\r\nfearing to touch them, they witnessed so mutely to the law of oblivion,\r\nI leaned back in my chair, and regarded them for a moment; when\r\nsuddenly there stood on the threshold of the little chamber, as though\r\nshe had just emerged from its depth, a tiny woman-form, as perfect in\r\nshape as if she had been a small Greek statuette roused to life and\r\nmotion. Her dress was of a kind that could never grow old-fashioned,\r\nbecause it was simply natural: a robe plaited in a band around the\r\nneck, and confined by a belt about the waist, descended to her feet. It\r\nwas only afterwards, however, that I took notice of her dress, although\r\nmy surprise was by no means of so overpowering a degree as such an\r\napparition might naturally be expected to excite. Seeing, however, as I\r\nsuppose, some astonishment in my countenance, she came forward within a\r\nyard of me, and said, in a voice that strangely recalled a sensation of\r\ntwilight, and reedy river banks, and a low wind, even in this deathly\r\nroom:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnodos, you never saw such a little creature before, did you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said I; \xe2\x80\x9cand indeed I hardly believe I do now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! that is always the way with you men; you believe nothing the first\r\ntime; and it is foolish enough to let mere repetition convince you of\r\nwhat you consider in itself unbelievable. I am not going to argue with\r\nyou, however, but to grant you a wish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere I could not help interrupting her with the foolish speech, of\r\nwhich, however, I had no cause to repent\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can such a very little creature as you grant or refuse anything?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that all the philosophy you have gained in one-and-twenty years?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid she. \xe2\x80\x9cForm is much, but size is nothing. It is a mere matter of\r\nrelation. I suppose your six-foot lordship does not feel altogether\r\ninsignificant, though to others you do look small beside your old Uncle\r\nRalph, who rises above you a great half-foot at least. But size is of\r\nso little consequence with old me, that I may as well accommodate\r\nmyself to your foolish prejudices.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, she leapt from the desk upon the floor, where she stood a\r\ntall, gracious lady, with pale face and large blue eyes. Her dark hair\r\nflowed behind, wavy but uncurled, down to her waist, and against it her\r\nform stood clear in its robe of white.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will believe me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOvercome with the presence of a beauty which I could now perceive, and\r\ndrawn towards her by an attraction irresistible as incomprehensible, I\r\nsuppose I stretched out my arms towards her, for she drew back a step\r\nor two, and said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFoolish boy, if you could touch me, I should hurt you. Besides, I was\r\ntwo hundred and thirty-seven years old, last Midsummer eve; and a man\r\nmust not fall in love with his grandmother, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you are not my grandmother,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know that?\xe2\x80\x9d she retorted. \xe2\x80\x9cI dare say you know something of\r\nyour great-grandfathers a good deal further back than that; but you\r\nknow very little about your great-grandmothers on either side. Now, to\r\nthe point. Your little sister was reading a fairy-tale to you last\r\nnight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen she had finished, she said, as she closed the book, \xe2\x80\x98Is there a\r\nfairy-country, brother?\xe2\x80\x99 You replied with a sigh, \xe2\x80\x98I suppose there is,\r\nif one could find the way into it.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did; but I meant something quite different from what you seem to\r\nthink.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind what I seem to think. You shall find the way into Fairy\r\nLand to-morrow. Now look in my eyes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEagerly I did so. They filled me with an unknown longing. I remembered\r\nsomehow that my mother died when I was a baby. I looked deeper and\r\ndeeper, till they spread around me like seas, and I sank in their\r\nwaters. I forgot all the rest, till I found myself at the window, whose\r\ngloomy curtains were withdrawn, and where I stood gazing on a whole\r\nheaven of stars, small and sparkling in the moonlight. Below lay a sea,\r\nstill as death and hoary in the moon, sweeping into bays and around\r\ncapes and islands, away, away, I knew not whither. Alas! it was no sea,\r\nbut a low bog burnished by the moon. \xe2\x80\x9cSurely there is such a sea\r\nsomewhere!\xe2\x80\x9d said I to myself. A low sweet voice beside me replied\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn Fairy Land, Anodos.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI turned, but saw no one. I closed the secretary, and went to my own\r\nroom, and to bed.\r\n\r\nAll this I recalled as I lay with half-closed eyes. I was soon to find\r\nthe truth of the lady\xe2\x80\x99s promise, that this day I should discover the\r\nroad into Fairy Land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Where is the stream?\xe2\x80\x99 cried he, with tears. \xe2\x80\x98Seest thou not its blue\r\nwaves above us?\xe2\x80\x99 He looked up, and lo! the blue stream was flowing\r\ngently over their heads.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94NOVALIS, _Heinrich von Ofterdingen_.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile these strange events were passing through my mind, I suddenly, as\r\none awakes to the consciousness that the sea has been moaning by him\r\nfor hours, or that the storm has been howling about his window all\r\nnight, became aware of the sound of running water near me; and, looking\r\nout of bed, I saw that a large green marble basin, in which I was wont\r\nto wash, and which stood on a low pedestal of the same material in a\r\ncorner of my room, was overflowing like a spring; and that a stream of\r\nclear water was running over the carpet, all the length of the room,\r\nfinding its outlet I knew not where. And, stranger still, where this\r\ncarpet, which I had myself designed to imitate a field of grass and\r\ndaisies, bordered the course of the little stream, the grass-blades and\r\ndaisies seemed to wave in a tiny breeze that followed the water\xe2\x80\x99s flow;\r\nwhile under the rivulet they bent and swayed with every motion of the\r\nchangeful current, as if they were about to dissolve with it, and,\r\nforsaking their fixed form, become fluent as the waters.\r\n\r\nMy dressing-table was an old-fashioned piece of furniture of black oak,\r\nwith drawers all down the front. These were elaborately carved in\r\nfoliage, of which ivy formed the chief part. The nearer end of this\r\ntable remained just as it had been, but on the further end a singular\r\nchange had commenced. I happened to fix my eye on a little cluster of\r\nivy-leaves. The first of these was evidently the work of the carver;\r\nthe next looked curious; the third was unmistakable ivy; and just\r\nbeyond it a tendril of clematis had twined itself about the gilt handle\r\nof one of the drawers. Hearing next a slight motion above me, I looked\r\nup, and saw that the branches and leaves designed upon the curtains of\r\nmy bed were slightly in motion. Not knowing what change might follow\r\nnext, I thought it high time to get up; and, springing from the bed, my\r\nbare feet alighted upon a cool green sward; and although I dressed in\r\nall haste, I found myself completing my toilet under the boughs of a\r\ngreat tree, whose top waved in the golden stream of the sunrise with\r\nmany interchanging lights, and with shadows of leaf and branch gliding\r\nover leaf and branch, as the cool morning wind swung it to and fro,\r\nlike a sinking sea-wave.\r\n\r\nAfter washing as well as I could in the clear stream, I rose and looked\r\naround me. The tree under which I seemed to have lain all night was one\r\nof the advanced guard of a dense forest, towards which the rivulet ran.\r\nFaint traces of a footpath, much overgrown with grass and moss, and\r\nwith here and there a pimpernel even, were discernible along the right\r\nbank. \xe2\x80\x9cThis,\xe2\x80\x9d thought I, \xe2\x80\x9cmust surely be the path into Fairy Land,\r\nwhich the lady of last night promised I should so soon find.\xe2\x80\x9d I crossed\r\nthe rivulet, and accompanied it, keeping the footpath on its right\r\nbank, until it led me, as I expected, into the wood. Here I left it,\r\nwithout any good reason: and with a vague feeling that I ought to have\r\nfollowed its course, I took a more southerly direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMan doth usurp all space,\r\nStares thee, in rock, bush, river, in the face.\r\nNever thine eyes behold a tree;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tis no sea thou seest in the sea,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tis but a disguised humanity.\r\nTo avoid thy fellow, vain thy plan;\r\nAll that interests a man, is man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n          HENRY SUTTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trees, which were far apart where I entered, giving free passage to\r\nthe level rays of the sun, closed rapidly as I advanced, so that ere\r\nlong their crowded stems barred the sunlight out, forming as it were a\r\nthick grating between me and the East. I seemed to be advancing towards\r\na second midnight. In the midst of the intervening twilight, however,\r\nbefore I entered what appeared to be the darkest portion of the forest,\r\nI saw a country maiden coming towards me from its very depths. She did\r\nnot seem to observe me, for she was apparently intent upon a bunch of\r\nwild flowers which she carried in her hand. I could hardly see her\r\nface; for, though she came direct towards me, she never looked up. But\r\nwhen we met, instead of passing, she turned and walked alongside of me\r\nfor a few yards, still keeping her face downwards, and busied with her\r\nflowers. She spoke rapidly, however, all the time, in a low tone, as if\r\ntalking to herself, but evidently addressing the purport of her words\r\nto me.\r\n\r\nShe seemed afraid of being observed by some lurking foe. \xe2\x80\x9cTrust the\r\nOak,\xe2\x80\x9d said she; \xe2\x80\x9ctrust the Oak, and the Elm, and the great Beech. Take\r\ncare of the Birch, for though she is honest, she is too young not to be\r\nchangeable. But shun the Ash and the Alder; for the Ash is an ogre,\xe2\x80\x94you\r\nwill know him by his thick fingers; and the Alder will smother you with\r\nher web of hair, if you let her near you at night.\xe2\x80\x9d All this was\r\nuttered without pause or alteration of tone. Then she turned suddenly\r\nand left me, walking still with the same unchanging gait. I could not\r\nconjecture what she meant, but satisfied myself with thinking that it\r\nwould be time enough to find out her meaning when there was need to\r\nmake use of her warning, and that the occasion would reveal the\r\nadmonition. I concluded from the flowers that she carried, that the\r\nforest could not be everywhere so dense as it appeared from where I was\r\nnow walking; and I was right in this conclusion. For soon I came to a\r\nmore open part, and by-and-by crossed a wide grassy glade, on which\r\nwere several circles of brighter green. But even here I was struck with\r\nthe utter stillness. No bird sang. No insect hummed. Not a living\r\ncreature crossed my way. Yet somehow the whole environment seemed only\r\nasleep, and to wear even in sleep an air of expectation. The trees\r\nseemed all to have an expression of conscious mystery, as if they said\r\nto themselves, \xe2\x80\x9cwe could, an\xe2\x80\x99 if we would.\xe2\x80\x9d They had all a meaning look\r\nabout them. Then I remembered that night is the fairies\xe2\x80\x99 day, and the\r\nmoon their sun; and I thought\xe2\x80\x94Everything sleeps and dreams now: when\r\nthe night comes, it will be different. At the same time I, being a man\r\nand a child of the day, felt some anxiety as to how I should fare among\r\nthe elves and other children of the night who wake when mortals dream,\r\nand find their common life in those wondrous hours that flow\r\nnoiselessly over the moveless death-like forms of men and women and\r\nchildren, lying strewn and parted beneath the weight of the heavy waves\r\nof night, which flow on and beat them down, and hold them drowned and\r\nsenseless, until the ebbtide comes, and the waves sink away, back into\r\nthe ocean of the dark. But I took courage and went on. Soon, however, I\r\nbecame again anxious, though from another cause. I had eaten nothing\r\nthat day, and for an hour past had been feeling the want of food. So I\r\ngrew afraid lest I should find nothing to meet my human necessities in\r\nthis strange place; but once more I comforted myself with hope and went\r\non.\r\n\r\nBefore noon, I fancied I saw a thin blue smoke rising amongst the stems\r\nof larger trees in front of me; and soon I came to an open spot of\r\nground in which stood a little cottage, so built that the stems of four\r\ngreat trees formed its corners, while their branches met and\r\nintertwined over its roof, heaping a great cloud of leaves over it, up\r\ntowards the heavens. I wondered at finding a human dwelling in this\r\nneighbourhood; and yet it did not look altogether human, though\r\nsufficiently so to encourage me to expect to find some sort of food.\r\nSeeing no door, I went round to the other side, and there I found one,\r\nwide open. A woman sat beside it, preparing some vegetables for dinner.\r\nThis was homely and comforting. As I came near, she looked up, and\r\nseeing me, showed no surprise, but bent her head again over her work,\r\nand said in a low tone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you see my daughter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe I did,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cCan you give me something to eat, for I am\r\nvery hungry?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWith pleasure,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, in the same tone; \xe2\x80\x9cbut do\r\nnot say anything more, till you come into the house, for the Ash is\r\nwatching us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaving said this, she rose and led the way into the cottage; which, I\r\nnow saw, was built of the stems of small trees set closely together,\r\nand was furnished with rough chairs and tables, from which even the\r\nbark had not been removed. As soon as she had shut the door and set a\r\nchair\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have fairy blood in you,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, looking hard at me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou could not have got so far into this wood if it were not so; and I\r\nam trying to find out some trace of it in your countenance. I think I\r\nsee it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you see?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, never mind: I may be mistaken in that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how then do you come to live here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I too have fairy blood in me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere I, in my turn, looked hard at her, and thought I could perceive,\r\nnotwithstanding the coarseness of her features, and especially the\r\nheaviness of her eyebrows, a something unusual\xe2\x80\x94I could hardly call it\r\ngrace, and yet it was an expression that strangely contrasted with the\r\nform of her features. I noticed too that her hands were delicately\r\nformed, though brown with work and exposure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should be ill,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, \xe2\x80\x9cif I did not live on the borders of\r\nthe fairies\xe2\x80\x99 country, and now and then eat of their food. And I see by\r\nyour eyes that you are not quite free of the same need; though, from\r\nyour education and the activity of your mind, you have felt it less\r\nthan I. You may be further removed too from the fairy race.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI remembered what the lady had said about my grandmothers.\r\n\r\nHere she placed some bread and some milk before me, with a kindly\r\napology for the homeliness of the fare, with which, however, I was in\r\nno humour to quarrel. I now thought it time to try to get some\r\nexplanation of the strange words both of her daughter and herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you mean by speaking so about the Ash?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe rose and looked out of the little window. My eyes followed her; but\r\nas the window was too small to allow anything to be seen from where I\r\nwas sitting, I rose and looked over her shoulder. I had just time to\r\nsee, across the open space, on the edge of the denser forest, a single\r\nlarge ash-tree, whose foliage showed bluish, amidst the truer green of\r\nthe other trees around it; when she pushed me back with an expression\r\nof impatience and terror, and then almost shut out the light from the\r\nwindow by setting up a large old book in it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn general,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, recovering her composure, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no danger\r\nin the daytime, for then he is sound asleep; but there is something\r\nunusual going on in the woods; there must be some solemnity among the\r\nfairies to-night, for all the trees are restless, and although they\r\ncannot come awake, they see and hear in their sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what danger is to be dreaded from him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nInstead of answering the question, she went again to the window and\r\nlooked out, saying she feared the fairies would be interrupted by foul\r\nweather, for a storm was brewing in the west.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the sooner it grows dark, the sooner the Ash will be awake,\xe2\x80\x9d added\r\nshe.\r\n\r\nI asked her how she knew that there was any unusual excitement in the\r\nwoods. She replied\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBesides the look of the trees, the dog there is unhappy; and the eyes\r\nand ears of the white rabbit are redder than usual, and he frisks about\r\nas if he expected some fun. If the cat were at home, she would have her\r\nback up; for the young fairies pull the sparks out of her tail with\r\nbramble thorns, and she knows when they are coming. So do I, in another\r\nway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this instant, a grey cat rushed in like a demon, and disappeared in\r\na hole in the wall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, I told you!\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what of the ash-tree?\xe2\x80\x9d said I, returning once more to the subject.\r\nHere, however, the young woman, whom I had met in the morning, entered.\r\nA smile passed between the mother and daughter; and then the latter\r\nbegan to help her mother in little household duties.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like to stay here till the evening,\xe2\x80\x9d I said; \xe2\x80\x9cand then go on\r\nmy journey, if you will allow me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are welcome to do as you please; only it might be better to stay\r\nall night, than risk the dangers of the wood then. Where are you\r\ngoing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, that I do not know,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I wish to see all that is to\r\nbe seen, and therefore I should like to start just at sundown.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a bold youth, if you have any idea of what you are daring; but\r\na rash one, if you know nothing about it; and, excuse me, you do not\r\nseem very well informed about the country and its manners. However, no\r\none comes here but for some reason, either known to himself or to those\r\nwho have charge of him; so you shall do just as you wish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAccordingly I sat down, and feeling rather tired, and disinclined for\r\nfurther talk, I asked leave to look at the old book which still\r\nscreened the window. The woman brought it to me directly, but not\r\nbefore taking another look towards the forest, and then drawing a white\r\nblind over the window. I sat down opposite to it by the table, on which\r\nI laid the great old volume, and read. It contained many wondrous tales\r\nof Fairy Land, and olden times, and the Knights of King Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s table.\r\nI read on and on, till the shades of the afternoon began to deepen; for\r\nin the midst of the forest it gloomed earlier than in the open country.\r\nAt length I came to this passage\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere it chanced, that upon their quest, Sir Galahad and Sir Percivale\r\nrencountered in the depths of a great forest. Now, Sir Galahad was\r\ndight all in harness of silver, clear and shining; the which is a\r\ndelight to look upon, but full hasty to tarnish, and withouten the\r\nlabour of a ready squire, uneath to be kept fair and clean. And yet\r\nwithouten squire or page, Sir Galahad\xe2\x80\x99s armour shone like the moon. And\r\nhe rode a great white mare, whose bases and other housings were black,\r\nbut all besprent with fair lilys of silver sheen. Whereas Sir Percivale\r\nbestrode a red horse, with a tawny mane and tail; whose trappings were\r\nall to-smirched with mud and mire; and his armour was wondrous rosty to\r\nbehold, ne could he by any art furbish it again; so that as the sun in\r\nhis going down shone twixt the bare trunks of the trees, full upon the\r\nknights twain, the one did seem all shining with light, and the other\r\nall to glow with ruddy fire. Now it came about in this wise. For Sir\r\nPercivale, after his escape from the demon lady, whenas the cross on\r\nthe handle of his sword smote him to the heart, and he rove himself\r\nthrough the thigh, and escaped away, he came to a great wood; and, in\r\nnowise cured of his fault, yet bemoaning the same, the damosel of the\r\nalder tree encountered him, right fair to see; and with her fair words\r\nand false countenance she comforted him and beguiled him, until he\r\nfollowed her where she led him to a\xe2\x80\x94-\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere a low hurried cry from my hostess caused me to look up from the\r\nbook, and I read no more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook there!\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9clook at his fingers!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJust as I had been reading in the book, the setting sun was shining\r\nthrough a cleft in the clouds piled up in the west; and a shadow as of\r\na large distorted hand, with thick knobs and humps on the fingers, so\r\nthat it was much wider across the fingers than across the undivided\r\npart of the hand, passed slowly over the little blind, and then as\r\nslowly returned in the opposite direction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is almost awake, mother; and greedier than usual to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush, child; you need not make him more angry with us than he is; for\r\nyou do not know how soon something may happen to oblige us to be in the\r\nforest after nightfall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you are in the forest,\xe2\x80\x9d said I; \xe2\x80\x9chow is it that you are safe\r\nhere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe dares not come nearer than he is now,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied; \xe2\x80\x9cfor any of\r\nthose four oaks, at the corners of our cottage, would tear him to\r\npieces; they are our friends. But he stands there and makes awful faces\r\nat us sometimes, and stretches out his long arms and fingers, and tries\r\nto kill us with fright; for, indeed, that is his favourite way of\r\ndoing. Pray, keep out of his way to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I be able to see these things?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I cannot tell yet, not knowing how much of the fairy nature there\r\nis in you. But we shall soon see whether you can discern the fairies in\r\nmy little garden, and that will be some guide to us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre the trees fairies too, as well as the flowers?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are of the same race,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied; \xe2\x80\x9cthough those you call\r\nfairies in your country are chiefly the young children of the flower\r\nfairies. They are very fond of having fun with the thick people, as\r\nthey call you; for, like most children, they like fun better than\r\nanything else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you have flowers so near you then? Do they not annoy you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, they are very amusing, with their mimicries of grown people,\r\nand mock solemnities. Sometimes they will act a whole play through\r\nbefore my eyes, with perfect composure and assurance, for they are not\r\nafraid of me. Only, as soon as they have done, they burst into peals of\r\ntiny laughter, as if it was such a joke to have been serious over\r\nanything. These I speak of, however, are the fairies of the garden.\r\nThey are more staid and educated than those of the fields and woods. Of\r\ncourse they have near relations amongst the wild flowers, but they\r\npatronise them, and treat them as country cousins, who know nothing of\r\nlife, and very little of manners. Now and then, however, they are\r\ncompelled to envy the grace and simplicity of the natural flowers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo they live _in_ the flowers?\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot tell,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is something in it I do not\r\nunderstand. Sometimes they disappear altogether, even from me, though I\r\nknow they are near. They seem to die always with the flowers they\r\nresemble, and by whose names they are called; but whether they return\r\nto life with the fresh flowers, or, whether it be new flowers, new\r\nfairies, I cannot tell. They have as many sorts of dispositions as men\r\nand women, while their moods are yet more variable; twenty different\r\nexpressions will cross their little faces in half a minute. I often\r\namuse myself with watching them, but I have never been able to make\r\npersonal acquaintance with any of them. If I speak to one, he or she\r\nlooks up in my face, as if I were not worth heeding, gives a little\r\nlaugh, and runs away.\xe2\x80\x9d Here the woman started, as if suddenly\r\nrecollecting herself, and said in a low voice to her daughter, \xe2\x80\x9cMake\r\nhaste\xe2\x80\x94go and watch him, and see in what direction he goes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI may as well mention here, that the conclusion I arrived at from the\r\nobservations I was afterwards able to make, was, that the flowers die\r\nbecause the fairies go away; not that the fairies disappear because the\r\nflowers die. The flowers seem a sort of houses for them, or outer\r\nbodies, which they can put on or off when they please. Just as you\r\ncould form some idea of the nature of a man from the kind of house he\r\nbuilt, if he followed his own taste, so you could, without seeing the\r\nfairies, tell what any one of them is like, by looking at the flower\r\ntill you feel that you understand it. For just what the flower says to\r\nyou, would the face and form of the fairy say; only so much more\r\nplainly as a face and human figure can express more than a flower. For\r\nthe house or the clothes, though like the inhabitant or the wearer,\r\ncannot be wrought into an equal power of utterance. Yet you would see a\r\nstrange resemblance, almost oneness, between the flower and the fairy,\r\nwhich you could not describe, but which described itself to you.\r\nWhether all the flowers have fairies, I cannot determine, any more than\r\nI can be sure whether all men and women have souls.\r\n\r\nThe woman and I continued the conversation for a few minutes longer. I\r\nwas much interested by the information she gave me, and astonished at\r\nthe language in which she was able to convey it. It seemed that\r\nintercourse with the fairies was no bad education in itself. But now\r\nthe daughter returned with the news, that the Ash had just gone away in\r\na south-westerly direction; and, as my course seemed to lie eastward,\r\nshe hoped I should be in no danger of meeting him if I departed at\r\nonce. I looked out of the little window, and there stood the ash-tree,\r\nto my eyes the same as before; but I believed that they knew better\r\nthan I did, and prepared to go. I pulled out my purse, but to my dismay\r\nthere was nothing in it. The woman with a smile begged me not to\r\ntrouble myself, for money was not of the slightest use there; and as I\r\nmight meet with people in my journeys whom I could not recognise to be\r\nfairies, it was well I had no money to offer, for nothing offended them\r\nso much.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey would think,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you were making game of them; and\r\nthat is their peculiar privilege with regard to us.\xe2\x80\x9d So we went\r\ntogether into the little garden which sloped down towards a lower part\r\nof the wood.\r\n\r\nHere, to my great pleasure, all was life and bustle. There was still\r\nlight enough from the day to see a little; and the pale half-moon,\r\nhalfway to the zenith, was reviving every moment. The whole garden was\r\nlike a carnival, with tiny, gaily decorated forms, in groups,\r\nassemblies, processions, pairs or trios, moving stately on, running\r\nabout wildly, or sauntering hither or thither. From the cups or bells\r\nof tall flowers, as from balconies, some looked down on the masses\r\nbelow, now bursting with laughter, now grave as owls; but even in their\r\ndeepest solemnity, seeming only to be waiting for the arrival of the\r\nnext laugh. Some were launched on a little marshy stream at the bottom,\r\nin boats chosen from the heaps of last year\xe2\x80\x99s leaves that lay about,\r\ncurled and withered. These soon sank with them; whereupon they swam\r\nashore and got others. Those who took fresh rose-leaves for their boats\r\nfloated the longest; but for these they had to fight; for the fairy of\r\nthe rose-tree complained bitterly that they were stealing her clothes,\r\nand defended her property bravely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t wear half you\xe2\x80\x99ve got,\xe2\x80\x9d said some.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever you mind; I don\xe2\x80\x99t choose you to have them: they are my\r\nproperty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll for the good of the community!\xe2\x80\x9d said one, and ran off with a great\r\nhollow leaf. But the rose-fairy sprang after him (what a beauty she\r\nwas! only too like a drawing-room young lady), knocked him\r\nheels-over-head as he ran, and recovered her great red leaf. But in the\r\nmeantime twenty had hurried off in different directions with others\r\njust as good; and the little creature sat down and cried, and then, in\r\na pet, sent a perfect pink snowstorm of petals from her tree, leaping\r\nfrom branch to branch, and stamping and shaking and pulling. At last,\r\nafter another good cry, she chose the biggest she could find, and ran\r\naway laughing, to launch her boat amongst the rest.\r\n\r\nBut my attention was first and chiefly attracted by a group of fairies\r\nnear the cottage, who were talking together around what seemed a last\r\ndying primrose. They talked singing, and their talk made a song,\r\nsomething like this:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSister Snowdrop died\r\n    Before we were born.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe came like a bride\r\n    In a snowy morn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s a bride?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is snow?\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever tried.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cDo not know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho told you about her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cLittle Primrose there\r\nCannot do without her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cOh, so sweetly fair!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever fear,\r\n    She will come,\r\nPrimrose dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cIs she dumb?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99ll come by-and-by.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cYou will never see her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe went home to die,\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cTill the new year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSnowdrop!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Tis no good\r\n    To invite her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrimrose is very rude,\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cI will bite her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you naughty Pocket!\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cLook, she drops her head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe deserved it, Rocket,\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cAnd she was nearly dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo your hammock\xe2\x80\x94off with you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cAnd swing alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo one will laugh with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cNo, not one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow let us moan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cAnd cover her o\xe2\x80\x99er.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrimrose is gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cAll but the flower.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is a leaf.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cLay her upon it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFollow in grief.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cPocket has done it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDeeper, poor creature!\r\n    Winter may come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe cannot reach her\xe2\x80\x94\r\n    That is a hum.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is buried, the beauty!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cNow she is done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was the duty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cNow for the fun.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd with a wild laugh they sprang away, most of them towards the\r\ncottage. During the latter part of the song-talk, they had formed\r\nthemselves into a funeral procession, two of them bearing poor\r\nPrimrose, whose death Pocket had hastened by biting her stalk, upon one\r\nof her own great leaves. They bore her solemnly along some distance,\r\nand then buried her under a tree. Although I say _her_ I saw nothing\r\nbut the withered primrose-flower on its long stalk. Pocket, who had\r\nbeen expelled from the company by common consent, went sulkily away\r\ntowards her hammock, for she was the fairy of the calceolaria, and\r\nlooked rather wicked. When she reached its stem, she stopped and looked\r\nround. I could not help speaking to her, for I stood near her. I said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPocket, how could you be so naughty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am never naughty,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, half-crossly, half-defiantly; \xe2\x80\x9conly if\r\nyou come near my hammock, I will bite you, and then you will go away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you bite poor Primrose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause she said we should never see Snowdrop; as if we were not good\r\nenough to look at her, and she was, the proud thing!\xe2\x80\x94served her right!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Pocket, Pocket,\xe2\x80\x9d said I; but by this time the party which had gone\r\ntowards the house, rushed out again, shouting and screaming with\r\nlaughter. Half of them were on the cat\xe2\x80\x99s back, and half held on by her\r\nfur and tail, or ran beside her; till, more coming to their help, the\r\nfurious cat was held fast; and they proceeded to pick the sparks out of\r\nher with thorns and pins, which they handled like harpoons. Indeed,\r\nthere were more instruments at work about her than there could have\r\nbeen sparks in her. One little fellow who held on hard by the tip of\r\nthe tail, with his feet planted on the ground at an angle of forty-five\r\ndegrees, helping to keep her fast, administered a continuous flow of\r\nadmonitions to Pussy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Pussy, be patient. You know quite well it is all for your good.\r\nYou cannot be comfortable with all those sparks in you; and, indeed, I\r\nam charitably disposed to believe\xe2\x80\x9d (here he became very pompous) \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\nthey are the cause of all your bad temper; so we must have them all\r\nout, every one; else we shall be reduced to the painful necessity of\r\ncutting your claws, and pulling out your eye-teeth. Quiet! Pussy,\r\nquiet!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut with a perfect hurricane of feline curses, the poor animal broke\r\nloose, and dashed across the garden and through the hedge, faster than\r\neven the fairies could follow. \xe2\x80\x9cNever mind, never mind, we shall find\r\nher again; and by that time she will have laid in a fresh stock of\r\nsparks. Hooray!\xe2\x80\x9d And off they set, after some new mischief.\r\n\r\nBut I will not linger to enlarge on the amusing display of these\r\nfrolicsome creatures. Their manners and habits are now so well known to\r\nthe world, having been so often described by eyewitnesses, that it\r\nwould be only indulging self-conceit, to add my account in full to the\r\nrest. I cannot help wishing, however, that my readers could see them\r\nfor themselves. Especially do I desire that they should see the fairy\r\nof the daisy; a little, chubby, round-eyed child, with such innocent\r\ntrust in his look! Even the most mischievous of the fairies would not\r\ntease him, although he did not belong to their set at all, but was\r\nquite a little country bumpkin. He wandered about alone, and looked at\r\neverything, with his hands in his little pockets, and a white night-cap\r\non, the darling! He was not so beautiful as many other wild flowers I\r\nsaw afterwards, but so dear and loving in his looks and little\r\nconfident ways.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen bale is att hyest, boote is nyest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n_Ballad of Sir Aldingar_.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy this time, my hostess was quite anxious that I should be gone. So,\r\nwith warm thanks for their hospitality, I took my leave, and went my\r\nway through the little garden towards the forest. Some of the garden\r\nflowers had wandered into the wood, and were growing here and there\r\nalong the path, but the trees soon became too thick and shadowy for\r\nthem. I particularly noticed some tall lilies, which grew on both sides\r\nof the way, with large dazzlingly white flowers, set off by the\r\nuniversal green. It was now dark enough for me to see that every flower\r\nwas shining with a light of its own. Indeed it was by this light that I\r\nsaw them, an internal, peculiar light, proceeding from each, and not\r\nreflected from a common source of light as in the daytime. This light\r\nsufficed only for the plant itself, and was not strong enough to cast\r\nany but the faintest shadows around it, or to illuminate any of the\r\nneighbouring objects with other than the faintest tinge of its own\r\nindividual hue. From the lilies above mentioned, from the campanulas,\r\nfrom the foxgloves, and every bell-shaped flower, curious little\r\nfigures shot up their heads, peeped at me, and drew back. They seemed\r\nto inhabit them, as snails their shells; but I was sure some of them\r\nwere intruders, and belonged to the gnomes or goblin-fairies, who\r\ninhabit the ground and earthy creeping plants. From the cups of Arum\r\nlilies, creatures with great heads and grotesque faces shot up like\r\nJack-in-the-box, and made grimaces at me; or rose slowly and slily over\r\nthe edge of the cup, and spouted water at me, slipping suddenly back,\r\nlike those little soldier-crabs that inhabit the shells of sea-snails.\r\nPassing a row of tall thistles, I saw them crowded with little faces,\r\nwhich peeped every one from behind its flower, and drew back as\r\nquickly; and I heard them saying to each other, evidently intending me\r\nto hear, but the speaker always hiding behind his tuft, when I looked\r\nin his direction, \xe2\x80\x9cLook at him! Look at him! He has begun a story\r\nwithout a beginning, and it will never have any end. He! he! he! Look\r\nat him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut as I went further into the wood, these sights and sounds became\r\nfewer, giving way to others of a different character. A little forest\r\nof wild hyacinths was alive with exquisite creatures, who stood nearly\r\nmotionless, with drooping necks, holding each by the stem of her\r\nflower, and swaying gently with it, whenever a low breath of wind swung\r\nthe crowded floral belfry. In like manner, though differing of course\r\nin form and meaning, stood a group of harebells, like little angels\r\nwaiting, ready, till they were wanted to go on some yet unknown\r\nmessage. In darker nooks, by the mossy roots of the trees, or in little\r\ntufts of grass, each dwelling in a globe of its own green light,\r\nweaving a network of grass and its shadows, glowed the glowworms.\r\n\r\nThey were just like the glowworms of our own land, for they are fairies\r\neverywhere; worms in the day, and glowworms at night, when their own\r\ncan appear, and they can be themselves to others as well as themselves.\r\nBut they had their enemies here. For I saw great strong-armed beetles,\r\nhurrying about with most unwieldy haste, awkward as elephant-calves,\r\nlooking apparently for glowworms; for the moment a beetle espied one,\r\nthrough what to it was a forest of grass, or an underwood of moss, it\r\npounced upon it, and bore it away, in spite of its feeble resistance.\r\nWondering what their object could be, I watched one of the beetles, and\r\nthen I discovered a thing I could not account for. But it is no use\r\ntrying to account for things in Fairy Land; and one who travels there\r\nsoon learns to forget the very idea of doing so, and takes everything\r\nas it comes; like a child, who, being in a chronic condition of wonder,\r\nis surprised at nothing. What I saw was this. Everywhere, here and\r\nthere over the ground, lay little, dark-looking lumps of something more\r\nlike earth than anything else, and about the size of a chestnut. The\r\nbeetles hunted in couples for these; and having found one, one of them\r\nstayed to watch it, while the other hurried to find a glowworm. By\r\nsignals, I presume, between them, the latter soon found his companion\r\nagain: they then took the glowworm and held its luminous tail to the\r\ndark earthly pellet; when lo, it shot up into the air like a\r\nsky-rocket, seldom, however, reaching the height of the highest tree.\r\nJust like a rocket too, it burst in the air, and fell in a shower of\r\nthe most gorgeously coloured sparks of every variety of hue; golden and\r\nred, and purple and green, and blue and rosy fires crossed and\r\ninter-crossed each other, beneath the shadowy heads, and between the\r\ncolumnar stems of the forest trees. They never used the same glowworm\r\ntwice, I observed; but let him go, apparently uninjured by the use they\r\nhad made of him.\r\n\r\nIn other parts, the whole of the immediately surrounding foliage was\r\nilluminated by the interwoven dances in the air of splendidly coloured\r\nfire-flies, which sped hither and thither, turned, twisted, crossed,\r\nand recrossed, entwining every complexity of intervolved motion. Here\r\nand there, whole mighty trees glowed with an emitted phosphorescent\r\nlight. You could trace the very course of the great roots in the earth\r\nby the faint light that came through; and every twig, and every vein on\r\nevery leaf was a streak of pale fire.\r\n\r\nAll this time, as I went through the wood, I was haunted with the\r\nfeeling that other shapes, more like my own size and mien, were moving\r\nabout at a little distance on all sides of me. But as yet I could\r\ndiscern none of them, although the moon was high enough to send a great\r\nmany of her rays down between the trees, and these rays were unusually\r\nbright, and sight-giving, notwithstanding she was only a half-moon. I\r\nconstantly imagined, however, that forms were visible in all directions\r\nexcept that to which my gaze was turned; and that they only became\r\ninvisible, or resolved themselves into other woodland shapes, the\r\nmoment my looks were directed towards them. However this may have been,\r\nexcept for this feeling of presence, the woods seemed utterly bare of\r\nanything like human companionship, although my glance often fell on\r\nsome object which I fancied to be a human form; for I soon found that I\r\nwas quite deceived; as, the moment I fixed my regard on it, it showed\r\nplainly that it was a bush, or a tree, or a rock.\r\n\r\nSoon a vague sense of discomfort possessed me. With variations of\r\nrelief, this gradually increased; as if some evil thing were wandering\r\nabout in my neighbourhood, sometimes nearer and sometimes further off,\r\nbut still approaching. The feeling continued and deepened, until all my\r\npleasure in the shows of various kinds that everywhere betokened the\r\npresence of the merry fairies vanished by degrees, and left me full of\r\nanxiety and fear, which I was unable to associate with any definite\r\nobject whatever. At length the thought crossed my mind with horror:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan it be possible that the Ash is looking for me? or that, in his\r\nnightly wanderings, his path is gradually verging towards mine?\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\ncomforted myself, however, by remembering that he had started quite in\r\nanother direction; one that would lead him, if he kept it, far apart\r\nfrom me; especially as, for the last two or three hours, I had been\r\ndiligently journeying eastward. I kept on my way, therefore, striving\r\nby direct effort of the will against the encroaching fear; and to this\r\nend occupying my mind, as much as I could, with other thoughts. I was\r\nso far successful that, although I was conscious, if I yielded for a\r\nmoment, I should be almost overwhelmed with horror, I was yet able to\r\nwalk right on for an hour or more. What I feared I could not tell.\r\nIndeed, I was left in a state of the vaguest uncertainty as regarded\r\nthe nature of my enemy, and knew not the mode or object of his attacks;\r\nfor, somehow or other, none of my questions had succeeded in drawing a\r\ndefinite answer from the dame in the cottage. How then to defend myself\r\nI knew not; nor even by what sign I might with certainty recognise the\r\npresence of my foe; for as yet this vague though powerful fear was all\r\nthe indication of danger I had. To add to my distress, the clouds in\r\nthe west had risen nearly to the top of the skies, and they and the\r\nmoon were travelling slowly towards each other. Indeed, some of their\r\nadvanced guard had already met her, and she had begun to wade through a\r\nfilmy vapour that gradually deepened.\r\n\r\nAt length she was for a moment almost entirely obscured. When she shone\r\nout again, with a brilliancy increased by the contrast, I saw plainly\r\non the path before me\xe2\x80\x94from around which at this spot the trees receded,\r\nleaving a small space of green sward\xe2\x80\x94the shadow of a large hand, with\r\nknotty joints and protuberances here and there. Especially I remarked,\r\neven in the midst of my fear, the bulbous points of the fingers. I\r\nlooked hurriedly all around, but could see nothing from which such a\r\nshadow should fall. Now, however, that I had a direction, however\r\nundetermined, in which to project my apprehension, the very sense of\r\ndanger and need of action overcame that stifling which is the worst\r\nproperty of fear. I reflected in a moment, that if this were indeed a\r\nshadow, it was useless to look for the object that cast it in any other\r\ndirection than between the shadow and the moon. I looked, and peered,\r\nand intensified my vision, all to no purpose. I could see nothing of\r\nthat kind, not even an ash-tree in the neighbourhood. Still the shadow\r\nremained; not steady, but moving to and fro, and once I saw the fingers\r\nclose, and grind themselves close, like the claws of a wild animal, as\r\nif in uncontrollable longing for some anticipated prey. There seemed\r\nbut one mode left of discovering the substance of this shadow. I went\r\nforward boldly, though with an inward shudder which I would not heed,\r\nto the spot where the shadow lay, threw myself on the ground, laid my\r\nhead within the form of the hand, and turned my eyes towards the moon.\r\nGood heavens! what did I see? I wonder that ever I arose, and that the\r\nvery shadow of the hand did not hold me where I lay until fear had\r\nfrozen my brain. I saw the strangest figure; vague, shadowy, almost\r\ntransparent, in the central parts, and gradually deepening in substance\r\ntowards the outside, until it ended in extremities capable of casting\r\nsuch a shadow as fell from the hand, through the awful fingers of which\r\nI now saw the moon. The hand was uplifted in the attitude of a paw\r\nabout to strike its prey. But the face, which throbbed with fluctuating\r\nand pulsatory visibility\xe2\x80\x94not from changes in the light it reflected,\r\nbut from changes in its own conditions of reflecting power, the\r\nalterations being from within, not from without\xe2\x80\x94it was horrible. I do\r\nnot know how to describe it. It caused a new sensation. Just as one\r\ncannot translate a horrible odour, or a ghastly pain, or a fearful\r\nsound, into words, so I cannot describe this new form of awful\r\nhideousness. I can only try to describe something that is not it, but\r\nseems somewhat parallel to it; or at least is suggested by it. It\r\nreminded me of what I had heard of vampires; for the face resembled\r\nthat of a corpse more than anything else I can think of; especially\r\nwhen I can conceive such a face in motion, but not suggesting any life\r\nas the source of the motion. The features were rather handsome than\r\notherwise, except the mouth, which had scarcely a curve in it. The lips\r\nwere of equal thickness; but the thickness was not at all remarkable,\r\neven although they looked slightly swollen. They seemed fixedly open,\r\nbut were not wide apart. Of course I did not _remark_ these lineaments\r\nat the time: I was too horrified for that. I noted them afterwards,\r\nwhen the form returned on my inward sight with a vividness too intense\r\nto admit of my doubting the accuracy of the reflex. But the most awful\r\nof the features were the eyes. These were alive, yet not with life.\r\n\r\nThey seemed lighted up with an infinite greed. A gnawing voracity,\r\nwhich devoured the devourer, seemed to be the indwelling and propelling\r\npower of the whole ghostly apparition. I lay for a few moments simply\r\nimbruted with terror; when another cloud, obscuring the moon, delivered\r\nme from the immediately paralysing effects of the presence to the\r\nvision of the object of horror, while it added the force of imagination\r\nto the power of fear within me; inasmuch as, knowing far worse cause\r\nfor apprehension than before, I remained equally ignorant from what I\r\nhad to defend myself, or how to take any precautions: he might be upon\r\nme in the darkness any moment. I sprang to my feet, and sped I knew not\r\nwhither, only away from the spectre. I thought no longer of the path,\r\nand often narrowly escaped dashing myself against a tree, in my\r\nheadlong flight of fear.\r\n\r\nGreat drops of rain began to patter on the leaves. Thunder began to\r\nmutter, then growl in the distance. I ran on. The rain fell heavier. At\r\nlength the thick leaves could hold it up no longer; and, like a second\r\nfirmament, they poured their torrents on the earth. I was soon\r\ndrenched, but that was nothing. I came to a small swollen stream that\r\nrushed through the woods. I had a vague hope that if I crossed this\r\nstream, I should be in safety from my pursuer; but I soon found that my\r\nhope was as false as it was vague. I dashed across the stream, ascended\r\na rising ground, and reached a more open space, where stood only great\r\ntrees. Through them I directed my way, holding eastward as nearly as I\r\ncould guess, but not at all certain that I was not moving in an\r\nopposite direction. My mind was just reviving a little from its extreme\r\nterror, when, suddenly, a flash of lightning, or rather a cataract of\r\nsuccessive flashes, behind me, seemed to throw on the ground in front\r\nof me, but far more faintly than before, from the extent of the source\r\nof the light, the shadow of the same horrible hand. I sprang forward,\r\nstung to yet wilder speed; but had not run many steps before my foot\r\nslipped, and, vainly attempting to recover myself, I fell at the foot\r\nof one of the large trees. Half-stunned, I yet raised myself, and\r\nalmost involuntarily looked back. All I saw was the hand within three\r\nfeet of my face. But, at the same moment, I felt two large soft arms\r\nthrown round me from behind; and a voice like a woman\xe2\x80\x99s said: \xe2\x80\x9cDo not\r\nfear the goblin; he dares not hurt you now.\xe2\x80\x9d With that, the hand was\r\nsuddenly withdrawn as from a fire, and disappeared in the darkness and\r\nthe rain. Overcome with the mingling of terror and joy, I lay for some\r\ntime almost insensible. The first thing I remember is the sound of a\r\nvoice above me, full and low, and strangely reminding me of the sound\r\nof a gentle wind amidst the leaves of a great tree. It murmured over\r\nand over again: \xe2\x80\x9cI may love him, I may love him; for he is a man, and I\r\nam only a beech-tree.\xe2\x80\x9d I found I was seated on the ground, leaning\r\nagainst a human form, and supported still by the arms around me, which\r\nI knew to be those of a woman who must be rather above the human size,\r\nand largely proportioned. I turned my head, but without moving\r\notherwise, for I feared lest the arms should untwine themselves; and\r\nclear, somewhat mournful eyes met mine. At least that is how they\r\nimpressed me; but I could see very little of colour or outline as we\r\nsat in the dark and rainy shadow of the tree. The face seemed very\r\nlovely, and solemn from its stillness; with the aspect of one who is\r\nquite content, but waiting for something. I saw my conjecture from her\r\narms was correct: she was above the human scale throughout, but not\r\ngreatly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you call yourself a beech-tree?\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I am one,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, in the same low, musical, murmuring\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a woman,\xe2\x80\x9d I returned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think so? Am I very like a woman then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a very beautiful woman. Is it possible you should not know\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very glad you think so. I fancy I feel like a woman sometimes. I\r\ndo so to-night\xe2\x80\x94and always when the rain drips from my hair. For there\r\nis an old prophecy in our woods that one day we shall all be men and\r\nwomen like you. Do you know anything about it in your region? Shall I\r\nbe very happy when I am a woman? I fear not, for it is always in nights\r\nlike these that I feel like one. But I long to be a woman for all\r\nthat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had let her talk on, for her voice was like a solution of all musical\r\nsounds. I now told her that I could hardly say whether women were happy\r\nor not. I knew one who had not been happy; and for my part, I had often\r\nlonged for Fairy Land, as she now longed for the world of men. But then\r\nneither of us had lived long, and perhaps people grew happier as they\r\ngrew older. Only I doubted it.\r\n\r\nI could not help sighing. She felt the sigh, for her arms were still\r\nround me. She asked me how old I was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwenty-one,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you baby!\xe2\x80\x9d said she, and kissed me with the sweetest kiss of\r\nwinds and odours. There was a cool faithfulness in the kiss that\r\nrevived my heart wonderfully. I felt that I feared the dreadful Ash no\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did the horrible Ash want with me?\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not quite sure, but I think he wants to bury you at the foot of\r\nhis tree. But he shall not touch you, my child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre all the ash-trees as dreadful as he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no. They are all disagreeable selfish creatures\xe2\x80\x94(what horrid men\r\nthey will make, if it be true!)\xe2\x80\x94but this one has a hole in his heart\r\nthat nobody knows of but one or two; and he is always trying to fill it\r\nup, but he cannot. That must be what he wanted you for. I wonder if he\r\nwill ever be a man. If he is, I hope they will kill him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow kind of you to save me from him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will take care that he shall not come near you again. But there are\r\nsome in the wood more like me, from whom, alas! I cannot protect you.\r\nOnly if you see any of them very beautiful, try to walk round them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot tell you more. But now I must tie some of my hair about you,\r\nand then the Ash will not touch you. Here, cut some off. You men have\r\nstrange cutting things about you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe shook her long hair loose over me, never moving her arms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot cut your beautiful hair. It would be a shame.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot cut my hair! It will have grown long enough before any is wanted\r\nagain in this wild forest. Perhaps it may never be of any use again\xe2\x80\x94not\r\ntill I am a woman.\xe2\x80\x9d And she sighed.\r\n\r\nAs gently as I could, I cut with a knife a long tress of flowing, dark\r\nhair, she hanging her beautiful head over me. When I had finished, she\r\nshuddered and breathed deep, as one does when an acute pain,\r\nsteadfastly endured without sign of suffering, is at length relaxed.\r\nShe then took the hair and tied it round me, singing a strange, sweet\r\nsong, which I could not understand, but which left in me a feeling like\r\nthis\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw thee ne\xe2\x80\x99er before;\r\nI see thee never more;\r\nBut love, and help, and pain, beautiful one,\r\nHave made thee mine, till all my years are done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nI cannot put more of it into words. She closed her arms about me again,\r\nand went on singing. The rain in the leaves, and a light wind that had\r\narisen, kept her song company. I was wrapt in a trance of still\r\ndelight. It told me the secret of the woods, and the flowers, and the\r\nbirds. At one time I felt as if I was wandering in childhood through\r\nsunny spring forests, over carpets of primroses, anemones, and little\r\nwhite starry things\xe2\x80\x94I had almost said creatures, and finding new\r\nwonderful flowers at every turn. At another, I lay half dreaming in the\r\nhot summer noon, with a book of old tales beside me, beneath a great\r\nbeech; or, in autumn, grew sad because I trod on the leaves that had\r\nsheltered me, and received their last blessing in the sweet odours of\r\ndecay; or, in a winter evening, frozen still, looked up, as I went home\r\nto a warm fireside, through the netted boughs and twigs to the cold,\r\nsnowy moon, with her opal zone around her. At last I had fallen asleep;\r\nfor I know nothing more that passed till I found myself lying under a\r\nsuperb beech-tree, in the clear light of the morning, just before\r\nsunrise. Around me was a girdle of fresh beech-leaves. Alas! I brought\r\nnothing with me out of Fairy Land, but memories\xe2\x80\x94memories. The great\r\nboughs of the beech hung drooping around me. At my head rose its smooth\r\nstem, with its great sweeps of curving surface that swelled like\r\nundeveloped limbs. The leaves and branches above kept on the song which\r\nhad sung me asleep; only now, to my mind, it sounded like a farewell\r\nand a speedwell. I sat a long time, unwilling to go; but my unfinished\r\nstory urged me on. I must act and wander. With the sun well risen, I\r\nrose, and put my arms as far as they would reach around the beech-tree,\r\nand kissed it, and said good-bye. A trembling went through the leaves;\r\na few of the last drops of the night\xe2\x80\x99s rain fell from off them at my\r\nfeet; and as I walked slowly away, I seemed to hear in a whisper once\r\nmore the words: \xe2\x80\x9cI may love him, I may love him; for he is a man, and I\r\nam only a beech-tree.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd she was smooth and full, as if one gush\r\nOf life had washed her, or as if a sleep\r\nLay on her eyelid, easier to sweep\r\nThan bee from daisy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n          BEDDOES\xe2\x80\x99 _Pygmalion_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSche was as whyt as lylye yn May,\r\nOr snow that sneweth yn wynterys day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n          _Romance of Sir Launfal_.\r\n\r\n\r\nI walked on, in the fresh morning air, as if new-born. The only thing\r\nthat damped my pleasure was a cloud of something between sorrow and\r\ndelight that crossed my mind with the frequently returning thought of\r\nmy last night\xe2\x80\x99s hostess. \xe2\x80\x9cBut then,\xe2\x80\x9d thought I, \xe2\x80\x9cif she is sorry, I\r\ncould not help it; and she has all the pleasures she ever had. Such a\r\nday as this is surely a joy to her, as much at least as to me. And her\r\nlife will perhaps be the richer, for holding now within it the memory\r\nof what came, but could not stay. And if ever she is a woman, who knows\r\nbut we may meet somewhere? there is plenty of room for meeting in the\r\nuniverse.\xe2\x80\x9d Comforting myself thus, yet with a vague compunction, as if\r\nI ought not to have left her, I went on. There was little to\r\ndistinguish the woods to-day from those of my own land; except that all\r\nthe wild things, rabbits, birds, squirrels, mice, and the numberless\r\nother inhabitants, were very tame; that is, they did not run away from\r\nme, but gazed at me as I passed, frequently coming nearer, as if to\r\nexamine me more closely. Whether this came from utter ignorance, or\r\nfrom familiarity with the human appearance of beings who never hurt\r\nthem, I could not tell. As I stood once, looking up to the splendid\r\nflower of a parasite, which hung from the branch of a tree over my\r\nhead, a large white rabbit cantered slowly up, put one of its little\r\nfeet on one of mine, and looked up at me with its red eyes, just as I\r\nhad been looking up at the flower above me. I stooped and stroked it;\r\nbut when I attempted to lift it, it banged the ground with its hind\r\nfeet and scampered off at a great rate, turning, however, to look at me\r\nseveral times before I lost sight of it. Now and then, too, a dim human\r\nfigure would appear and disappear, at some distance, amongst the trees,\r\nmoving like a sleep-walker. But no one ever came near me.\r\n\r\nThis day I found plenty of food in the forest\xe2\x80\x94strange nuts and fruits I\r\nhad never seen before. I hesitated to eat them; but argued that, if I\r\ncould live on the air of Fairy Land, I could live on its food also. I\r\nfound my reasoning correct, and the result was better than I had hoped;\r\nfor it not only satisfied my hunger, but operated in such a way upon my\r\nsenses that I was brought into far more complete relationship with the\r\nthings around me. The human forms appeared much more dense and defined;\r\nmore tangibly visible, if I may say so. I seemed to know better which\r\ndirection to choose when any doubt arose. I began to feel in some\r\ndegree what the birds meant in their songs, though I could not express\r\nit in words, any more than you can some landscapes. At times, to my\r\nsurprise, I found myself listening attentively, and as if it were no\r\nunusual thing with me, to a conversation between two squirrels or\r\nmonkeys. The subjects were not very interesting, except as associated\r\nwith the individual life and necessities of the little creatures: where\r\nthe best nuts were to be found in the neighbourhood, and who could\r\ncrack them best, or who had most laid up for the winter, and such like;\r\nonly they never said where the store was. There was no great difference\r\nin kind between their talk and our ordinary human conversation. Some of\r\nthe creatures I never heard speak at all, and believe they never do so,\r\nexcept under the impulse of some great excitement. The mice talked; but\r\nthe hedgehogs seemed very phlegmatic; and though I met a couple of\r\nmoles above ground several times, they never said a word to each other\r\nin my hearing. There were no wild beasts in the forest; at least, I did\r\nnot see one larger than a wild cat. There were plenty of snakes,\r\nhowever, and I do not think they were all harmless; but none ever bit\r\nme.\r\n\r\nSoon after mid-day I arrived at a bare rocky hill, of no great size,\r\nbut very steep; and having no trees\xe2\x80\x94scarcely even a bush\xe2\x80\x94upon it,\r\nentirely exposed to the heat of the sun. Over this my way seemed to\r\nlie, and I immediately began the ascent. On reaching the top, hot and\r\nweary, I looked around me, and saw that the forest still stretched as\r\nfar as the sight could reach on every side of me. I observed that the\r\ntrees, in the direction in which I was about to descend, did not come\r\nso near the foot of the hill as on the other side, and was especially\r\nregretting the unexpected postponement of shelter, because this side of\r\nthe hill seemed more difficult to descend than the other had been to\r\nclimb, when my eye caught the appearance of a natural path, winding\r\ndown through broken rocks and along the course of a tiny stream, which\r\nI hoped would lead me more easily to the foot. I tried it, and found\r\nthe descent not at all laborious; nevertheless, when I reached the\r\nbottom, I was very tired and exhausted with the heat. But just where\r\nthe path seemed to end, rose a great rock, quite overgrown with shrubs\r\nand creeping plants, some of them in full and splendid blossom: these\r\nalmost concealed an opening in the rock, into which the path appeared\r\nto lead. I entered, thirsting for the shade which it promised. What was\r\nmy delight to find a rocky cell, all the angles rounded away with rich\r\nmoss, and every ledge and projection crowded with lovely ferns, the\r\nvariety of whose forms, and groupings, and shades wrought in me like a\r\npoem; for such a harmony could not exist, except they all consented to\r\nsome one end! A little well of the clearest water filled a mossy hollow\r\nin one corner. I drank, and felt as if I knew what the elixir of life\r\nmust be; then threw myself on a mossy mound that lay like a couch along\r\nthe inner end. Here I lay in a delicious reverie for some time; during\r\nwhich all lovely forms, and colours, and sounds seemed to use my brain\r\nas a common hall, where they could come and go, unbidden and unexcused.\r\nI had never imagined that such capacity for simple happiness lay in me,\r\nas was now awakened by this assembly of forms and spiritual sensations,\r\nwhich yet were far too vague to admit of being translated into any\r\nshape common to my own and another mind. I had lain for an hour, I\r\nshould suppose, though it may have been far longer, when, the\r\nharmonious tumult in my mind having somewhat relaxed, I became aware\r\nthat my eyes were fixed on a strange, time-worn bas-relief on the rock\r\nopposite to me. This, after some pondering, I concluded to represent\r\nPygmalion, as he awaited the quickening of his statue. The sculptor sat\r\nmore rigid than the figure to which his eyes were turned. That seemed\r\nabout to step from its pedestal and embrace the man, who waited rather\r\nthan expected.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA lovely story,\xe2\x80\x9d I said to myself. \xe2\x80\x9cThis cave, now, with the bushes\r\ncut away from the entrance to let the light in, might be such a place\r\nas he would choose, withdrawn from the notice of men, to set up his\r\nblock of marble, and mould into a visible body the thought already\r\nclothed with form in the unseen hall of the sculptor\xe2\x80\x99s brain. And,\r\nindeed, if I mistake not,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, starting up, as a sudden ray of\r\nlight arrived at that moment through a crevice in the roof, and lighted\r\nup a small portion of the rock, bare of vegetation, \xe2\x80\x9cthis very rock is\r\nmarble, white enough and delicate enough for any statue, even if\r\ndestined to become an ideal woman in the arms of the sculptor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI took my knife and removed the moss from a part of the block on which\r\nI had been lying; when, to my surprise, I found it more like alabaster\r\nthan ordinary marble, and soft to the edge of the knife. In fact, it\r\nwas alabaster. By an inexplicable, though by no means unusual kind of\r\nimpulse, I went on removing the moss from the surface of the stone; and\r\nsoon saw that it was polished, or at least smooth, throughout. I\r\ncontinued my labour; and after clearing a space of about a couple of\r\nsquare feet, I observed what caused me to prosecute the work with more\r\ninterest and care than before. For the ray of sunlight had now reached\r\nthe spot I had cleared, and under its lustre the alabaster revealed its\r\nusual slight transparency when polished, except where my knife had\r\nscratched the surface; and I observed that the transparency seemed to\r\nhave a definite limit, and to end upon an opaque body like the more\r\nsolid, white marble. I was careful to scratch no more. And first, a\r\nvague anticipation gave way to a startling sense of possibility; then,\r\nas I proceeded, one revelation after another produced the entrancing\r\nconviction, that under the crust of alabaster lay a dimly visible form\r\nin marble, but whether of man or woman I could not yet tell. I worked\r\non as rapidly as the necessary care would permit; and when I had\r\nuncovered the whole mass, and rising from my knees, had retreated a\r\nlittle way, so that the effect of the whole might fall on me, I saw\r\nbefore me with sufficient plainness\xe2\x80\x94though at the same time with\r\nconsiderable indistinctness, arising from the limited amount of light\r\nthe place admitted, as well as from the nature of the object itself\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nblock of pure alabaster enclosing the form, apparently in marble, of a\r\nreposing woman. She lay on one side, with her hand under her cheek, and\r\nher face towards me; but her hair had fallen partly over her face, so\r\nthat I could not see the expression of the whole. What I did see\r\nappeared to me perfectly lovely; more near the face that had been born\r\nwith me in my soul, than anything I had seen before in nature or art.\r\nThe actual outlines of the rest of the form were so indistinct, that\r\nthe more than semi-opacity of the alabaster seemed insufficient to\r\naccount for the fact; and I conjectured that a light robe added its\r\nobscurity. Numberless histories passed through my mind of change of\r\nsubstance from enchantment and other causes, and of imprisonments such\r\nas this before me. I thought of the Prince of the Enchanted City, half\r\nmarble and half a man; of Ariel; of Niobe; of the Sleeping Beauty in\r\nthe Wood; of the bleeding trees; and many other histories. Even my\r\nadventure of the preceding evening with the lady of the beech-tree\r\ncontributed to arouse the wild hope, that by some means life might be\r\ngiven to this form also, and that, breaking from her alabaster tomb,\r\nshe might glorify my eyes with her presence. \xe2\x80\x9cFor,\xe2\x80\x9d I argued, \xe2\x80\x9cwho can\r\ntell but this cave may be the home of Marble, and this, essential\r\nMarble\xe2\x80\x94that spirit of marble which, present throughout, makes it\r\ncapable of being moulded into any form? Then if she should awake! But\r\nhow to awake her? A kiss awoke the Sleeping Beauty! a kiss cannot reach\r\nher through the incrusting alabaster.\xe2\x80\x9d I kneeled, however, and kissed\r\nthe pale coffin; but she slept on. I bethought me of Orpheus, and the\r\nfollowing stones\xe2\x80\x94that trees should follow his music seemed nothing\r\nsurprising now. Might not a song awake this form, that the glory of\r\nmotion might for a time displace the loveliness of rest? Sweet sounds\r\ncan go where kisses may not enter. I sat and thought. Now, although\r\nalways delighting in music, I had never been gifted with the power of\r\nsong, until I entered the fairy forest. I had a voice, and I had a true\r\nsense of sound; but when I tried to sing, the one would not content the\r\nother, and so I remained silent. This morning, however, I had found\r\nmyself, ere I was aware, rejoicing in a song; but whether it was before\r\nor after I had eaten of the fruits of the forest, I could not satisfy\r\nmyself. I concluded it was after, however; and that the increased\r\nimpulse to sing I now felt, was in part owing to having drunk of the\r\nlittle well, which shone like a brilliant eye in a corner of the cave.\r\nI sat down on the ground by the \xe2\x80\x9cantenatal tomb,\xe2\x80\x9d leaned upon it with\r\nmy face towards the head of the figure within, and sang\xe2\x80\x94the words and\r\ntones coming together, and inseparably connected, as if word and tone\r\nformed one thing; or, as if each word could be uttered only in that\r\ntone, and was incapable of distinction from it, except in idea, by an\r\nacute analysis. I sang something like this: but the words are only a\r\ndull representation of a state whose very elevation precluded the\r\npossibility of remembrance; and in which I presume the words really\r\nemployed were as far above these, as that state transcended this\r\nwherein I recall it:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarble woman, vainly sleeping\r\nIn the very death of dreams!\r\nWilt thou\xe2\x80\x94slumber from thee sweeping,\r\nAll but what with vision teems\xe2\x80\x94\r\nHear my voice come through the golden\r\nMist of memory and hope;\r\nAnd with shadowy smile embolden\r\nMe with primal Death to cope?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThee the sculptors all pursuing,\r\nHave embodied but their own;\r\nRound their visions, form enduring,\r\nMarble vestments thou hast thrown;\r\nBut thyself, in silence winding,\r\nThou hast kept eternally;\r\nThee they found not, many finding\xe2\x80\x94\r\nI have found thee: wake for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I sang, I looked earnestly at the face so vaguely revealed before\r\nme. I fancied, yet believed it to be but fancy, that through the dim\r\nveil of the alabaster, I saw a motion of the head as if caused by a\r\nsinking sigh. I gazed more earnestly, and concluded that it was but\r\nfancy. Neverthless I could not help singing again\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRest is now filled full of beauty,\r\nAnd can give thee up, I ween;\r\nCome thou forth, for other duty\r\nMotion pineth for her queen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr, if needing years to wake thee\r\nFrom thy slumbrous solitudes,\r\nCome, sleep-walking, and betake thee\r\nTo the friendly, sleeping woods.\r\n\r\nSweeter dreams are in the forest,\r\nRound thee storms would never rave;\r\nAnd when need of rest is sorest,\r\nGlide thou then into thy cave.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr, if still thou choosest rather\r\nMarble, be its spell on me;\r\nLet thy slumber round me gather,\r\nLet another dream with thee!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain I paused, and gazed through the stony shroud, as if, by very\r\nforce of penetrative sight, I would clear every lineament of the lovely\r\nface. And now I thought the hand that had lain under the cheek, had\r\nslipped a little downward. But then I could not be sure that I had at\r\nfirst observed its position accurately. So I sang again; for the\r\nlonging had grown into a passionate need of seeing her alive\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr art thou Death, O woman? for since I\r\n    Have set me singing by thy side,\r\nLife hath forsook the upper sky,\r\n    And all the outer world hath died.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYea, I am dead; for thou hast drawn\r\n    My life all downward unto thee.\r\nDead moon of love! let twilight dawn:\r\n    Awake! and let the darkness flee.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCold lady of the lovely stone!\r\n    Awake! or I shall perish here;\r\nAnd thou be never more alone,\r\n    My form and I for ages near.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut words are vain; reject them all\xe2\x80\x94\r\n    They utter but a feeble part:\r\nHear thou the depths from which they call,\r\n    The voiceless longing of my heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThere arose a slightly crashing sound. Like a sudden apparition that\r\ncomes and is gone, a white form, veiled in a light robe of whiteness,\r\nburst upwards from the stone, stood, glided forth, and gleamed away\r\ntowards the woods. For I followed to the mouth of the cave, as soon as\r\nthe amazement and concentration of delight permitted the nerves of\r\nmotion again to act; and saw the white form amidst the trees, as it\r\ncrossed a little glade on the edge of the forest where the sunlight\r\nfell full, seeming to gather with intenser radiance on the one object\r\nthat floated rather than flitted through its lake of beams. I gazed\r\nafter her in a kind of despair; found, freed, lost! It seemed useless\r\nto follow, yet follow I must. I marked the direction she took; and\r\nwithout once looking round to the forsaken cave, I hastened towards the\r\nforest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, let a man beware, when his wishes, fulfilled, rain down\r\nupon him, and his happiness is unbounded.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n          \xe2\x80\x94FOUQU\xc3\x89, _Der Zauberring_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThy red lips, like worms,\r\nTravel over my cheek.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n          \xe2\x80\x94MOTHERWELL.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut as I crossed the space between the foot of the hill and the forest,\r\na vision of another kind delayed my steps. Through an opening to the\r\nwestward flowed, like a stream, the rays of the setting sun, and\r\noverflowed with a ruddy splendour the open space where I was. And\r\nriding as it were down this stream towards me, came a horseman in what\r\nappeared red armour. From frontlet to tail, the horse likewise shone\r\nred in the sunset. I felt as if I must have seen the knight before; but\r\nas he drew near, I could recall no feature of his countenance. Ere he\r\ncame up to me, however, I remembered the legend of Sir Percival in the\r\nrusty armour, which I had left unfinished in the old book in the\r\ncottage: it was of Sir Percival that he reminded me. And no wonder; for\r\nwhen he came close up to me, I saw that, from crest to heel, the whole\r\nsurface of his armour was covered with a light rust. The golden spurs\r\nshone, but the iron greaves glowed in the sunlight. The _morning star_,\r\nwhich hung from his wrist, glittered and glowed with its silver and\r\nbronze. His whole appearance was terrible; but his face did not answer\r\nto this appearance. It was sad, even to gloominess; and something of\r\nshame seemed to cover it. Yet it was noble and high, though thus\r\nbeclouded; and the form looked lofty, although the head drooped, and\r\nthe whole frame was bowed as with an inward grief. The horse seemed to\r\nshare in his master\xe2\x80\x99s dejection, and walked spiritless and slow. I\r\nnoticed, too, that the white plume on his helmet was discoloured and\r\ndrooping. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has fallen in a joust with spears,\xe2\x80\x9d I said to myself;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyet it becomes not a noble knight to be conquered in spirit because\r\nhis body hath fallen.\xe2\x80\x9d He appeared not to observe me, for he was riding\r\npast without looking up, and started into a warlike attitude the moment\r\nthe first sound of my voice reached him. Then a flush, as of shame,\r\ncovered all of his face that the lifted beaver disclosed. He returned\r\nmy greeting with distant courtesy, and passed on. But suddenly, he\r\nreined up, sat a moment still, and then turning his horse, rode back to\r\nwhere I stood looking after him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am ashamed,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cto appear a knight, and in such a guise; but\r\nit behoves me to tell you to take warning from me, lest the same evil,\r\nin his kind, overtake the singer that has befallen the knight. Hast\r\nthou ever read the story of Sir Percival and the\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94(here he shuddered,\r\nthat his armour rang)\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cMaiden of the Alder-tree?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn part, I have,\xe2\x80\x9d said I; \xe2\x80\x9cfor yesterday, at the entrance of this\r\nforest, I found in a cottage the volume wherein it is recorded.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen take heed,\xe2\x80\x9d he rejoined; \xe2\x80\x9cfor, see my armour\xe2\x80\x94I put it off; and as\r\nit befell to him, so has it befallen to me. I that was proud am humble\r\nnow. Yet is she terribly beautiful\xe2\x80\x94beware. Never,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, raising\r\nhis head, \xe2\x80\x9cshall this armour be furbished, but by the blows of knightly\r\nencounter, until the last speck has disappeared from every spot where\r\nthe battle-axe and sword of evil-doers, or noble foes, might fall; when\r\nI shall again lift my head, and say to my squire, \xe2\x80\x98Do thy duty once\r\nmore, and make this armour shine.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore I could inquire further, he had struck spurs into his horse and\r\ngalloped away, shrouded from my voice in the noise of his armour. For I\r\ncalled after him, anxious to know more about this fearful enchantress;\r\nbut in vain\xe2\x80\x94he heard me not. \xe2\x80\x9cYet,\xe2\x80\x9d I said to myself, \xe2\x80\x9cI have now been\r\noften warned; surely I shall be well on my guard; and I am fully\r\nresolved I shall not be ensnared by any beauty, however beautiful.\r\nDoubtless, some one man may escape, and I shall be he.\xe2\x80\x9d So I went on\r\ninto the wood, still hoping to find, in some one of its mysterious\r\nrecesses, my lost lady of the marble. The sunny afternoon died into the\r\nloveliest twilight. Great bats began to flit about with their own\r\nnoiseless flight, seemingly purposeless, because its objects are\r\nunseen. The monotonous music of the owl issued from all unexpected\r\nquarters in the half-darkness around me. The glow-worm was alight here\r\nand there, burning out into the great universe. The night-hawk\r\nheightened all the harmony and stillness with his oft-recurring,\r\ndiscordant jar. Numberless unknown sounds came out of the unknown dusk;\r\nbut all were of twilight-kind, oppressing the heart as with a condensed\r\natmosphere of dreamy undefined love and longing. The odours of night\r\narose, and bathed me in that luxurious mournfulness peculiar to them,\r\nas if the plants whence they floated had been watered with bygone\r\ntears. Earth drew me towards her bosom; I felt as if I could fall down\r\nand kiss her. I forgot I was in Fairy Land, and seemed to be walking in\r\na perfect night of our own old nursing earth. Great stems rose about\r\nme, uplifting a thick multitudinous roof above me of branches, and\r\ntwigs, and leaves\xe2\x80\x94the bird and insect world uplifted over mine, with\r\nits own landscapes, its own thickets, and paths, and glades, and\r\ndwellings; its own bird-ways and insect-delights. Great boughs crossed\r\nmy path; great roots based the tree-columns, and mightily clasped the\r\nearth, strong to lift and strong to uphold. It seemed an old, old\r\nforest, perfect in forest ways and pleasures. And when, in the midst of\r\nthis ecstacy, I remembered that under some close canopy of leaves, by\r\nsome giant stem, or in some mossy cave, or beside some leafy well, sat\r\nthe lady of the marble, whom my songs had called forth into the outer\r\nworld, waiting (might it not be?) to meet and thank her deliverer in a\r\ntwilight which would veil her confusion, the whole night became one\r\ndream-realm of joy, the central form of which was everywhere present,\r\nalthough unbeheld. Then, remembering how my songs seemed to have called\r\nher from the marble, piercing through the pearly shroud of\r\nalabaster\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\xe2\x80\x9d thought I, \xe2\x80\x9cshould not my voice reach her now, through\r\nthe ebon night that inwraps her.\xe2\x80\x9d My voice burst into song so\r\nspontaneously that it seemed involuntarily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a sound\r\nBut, echoing in me,\r\nVibrates all around\r\nWith a blind delight,\r\nTill it breaks on Thee,\r\nQueen of Night!\r\n\r\nEvery tree,\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99ershadowing with gloom,\r\nSeems to cover thee\r\nSecret, dark, love-still\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nIn a holy room\r\nSilence-filled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet no moon\r\nCreep up the heaven to-night;\r\nI in darksome noon\r\nWalking hopefully,\r\nSeek my shrouded light\xe2\x80\x94\r\nGrope for thee!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDarker grow\r\nThe borders of the dark!\r\nThrough the branches glow,\r\nFrom the roof above,\r\nStar and diamond-sparks\r\nLight for love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nScarcely had the last sounds floated away from the hearing of my own\r\nears, when I heard instead a low delicious laugh near me. It was not\r\nthe laugh of one who would not be heard, but the laugh of one who has\r\njust received something long and patiently desired\xe2\x80\x94a laugh that ends in\r\na low musical moan. I started, and, turning sideways, saw a dim white\r\nfigure seated beside an intertwining thicket of smaller trees and\r\nunderwood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is my white lady!\xe2\x80\x9d I said, and flung myself on the ground beside\r\nher; striving, through the gathering darkness, to get a glimpse of the\r\nform which had broken its marble prison at my call.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is your white lady!\xe2\x80\x9d said the sweetest voice, in reply, sending a\r\nthrill of speechless delight through a heart which all the love-charms\r\nof the preceding day and evening had been tempering for this\r\nculminating hour. Yet, if I would have confessed it, there was\r\nsomething either in the sound of the voice, although it seemed\r\nsweetness itself, or else in this yielding which awaited no gradation\r\nof gentle approaches, that did not vibrate harmoniously with the beat\r\nof my inward music. And likewise, when, taking her hand in mine, I drew\r\ncloser to her, looking for the beauty of her face, which, indeed, I\r\nfound too plenteously, a cold shiver ran through me; but \xe2\x80\x9cit is the\r\nmarble,\xe2\x80\x9d I said to myself, and heeded it not.\r\n\r\nShe withdrew her hand from mine, and after that would scarce allow me\r\nto touch her. It seemed strange, after the fulness of her first\r\ngreeting, that she could not trust me to come close to her. Though her\r\nwords were those of a lover, she kept herself withdrawn as if a mile of\r\nspace interposed between us.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you run away from me when you woke in the cave?\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid I?\xe2\x80\x9d she returned. \xe2\x80\x9cThat was very unkind of me; but I did not know\r\nbetter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I could see you. The night is very dark.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo it is. Come to my grotto. There is light there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you another cave, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome and see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut she did not move until I rose first, and then she was on her feet\r\nbefore I could offer my hand to help her. She came close to my side,\r\nand conducted me through the wood. But once or twice, when,\r\ninvoluntarily almost, I was about to put my arm around her as we walked\r\non through the warm gloom, she sprang away several paces, always\r\nkeeping her face full towards me, and then stood looking at me,\r\nslightly stooping, in the attitude of one who fears some half-seen\r\nenemy. It was too dark to discern the expression of her face. Then she\r\nwould return and walk close beside me again, as if nothing had\r\nhappened. I thought this strange; but, besides that I had almost, as I\r\nsaid before, given up the attempt to account for appearances in Fairy\r\nLand, I judged that it would be very unfair to expect from one who had\r\nslept so long and had been so suddenly awakened, a behaviour\r\ncorrespondent to what I might unreflectingly look for. I knew not what\r\nshe might have been dreaming about. Besides, it was possible that,\r\nwhile her words were free, her sense of touch might be exquisitely\r\ndelicate.\r\n\r\nAt length, after walking a long way in the woods, we arrived at another\r\nthicket, through the intertexture of which was glimmering a pale rosy\r\nlight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPush aside the branches,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cand make room for us to enter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI did as she told me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo in,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cI will follow you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI did as she desired, and found myself in a little cave, not very\r\nunlike the marble cave. It was festooned and draperied with all kinds\r\nof green that cling to shady rocks. In the furthest corner, half-hidden\r\nin leaves, through which it glowed, mingling lovely shadows between\r\nthem, burned a bright rosy flame on a little earthen lamp. The lady\r\nglided round by the wall from behind me, still keeping her face towards\r\nme, and seated herself in the furthest corner, with her back to the\r\nlamp, which she hid completely from my view. I then saw indeed a form\r\nof perfect loveliness before me. Almost it seemed as if the light of\r\nthe rose-lamp shone through her (for it could not be reflected from\r\nher); such a delicate shade of pink seemed to shadow what in itself\r\nmust be a marbly whiteness of hue. I discovered afterwards, however,\r\nthat there was one thing in it I did not like; which was, that the\r\nwhite part of the eye was tinged with the same slight roseate hue as\r\nthe rest of the form. It is strange that I cannot recall her features;\r\nbut they, as well as her somewhat girlish figure, left on me simply and\r\nonly the impression of intense loveliness. I lay down at her feet, and\r\ngazed up into her face as I lay. She began, and told me a strange tale,\r\nwhich, likewise, I cannot recollect; but which, at every turn and every\r\npause, somehow or other fixed my eyes and thoughts upon her extreme\r\nbeauty; seeming always to culminate in something that had a relation,\r\nrevealed or hidden, but always operative, with her own loveliness. I\r\nlay entranced. It was a tale which brings back a feeling as of snows\r\nand tempests; torrents and water-sprites; lovers parted for long, and\r\nmeeting at last; with a gorgeous summer night to close up the whole. I\r\nlistened till she and I were blended with the tale; till she and I were\r\nthe whole history. And we had met at last in this same cave of\r\ngreenery, while the summer night hung round us heavy with love, and the\r\nodours that crept through the silence from the sleeping woods were the\r\nonly signs of an outer world that invaded our solitude. What followed I\r\ncannot clearly remember. The succeeding horror almost obliterated it. I\r\nwoke as a grey dawn stole into the cave. The damsel had disappeared;\r\nbut in the shrubbery, at the mouth of the cave, stood a strange\r\nhorrible object. It looked like an open coffin set up on one end; only\r\nthat the part for the head and neck was defined from the shoulder-part.\r\nIn fact, it was a rough representation of the human frame, only hollow,\r\nas if made of decaying bark torn from a tree.\r\n\r\nIt had arms, which were only slightly seamed, down from the\r\nshoulder-blade by the elbow, as if the bark had healed again from the\r\ncut of a knife. But the arms moved, and the hand and the fingers were\r\ntearing asunder a long silky tress of hair. The thing turned round\xe2\x80\x94it\r\nhad for a face and front those of my enchantress, but now of a pale\r\ngreenish hue in the light of the morning, and with dead lustreless\r\neyes. In the horror of the moment, another fear invaded me. I put my\r\nhand to my waist, and found indeed that my girdle of beech-leaves was\r\ngone. Hair again in her hands, she was tearing it fiercely. Once more,\r\nas she turned, she laughed a low laugh, but now full of scorn and\r\nderision; and then she said, as if to a companion with whom she had\r\nbeen talking while I slept, \xe2\x80\x9cThere he is; you can take him now.\xe2\x80\x9d I lay\r\nstill, petrified with dismay and fear; for I now saw another figure\r\nbeside her, which, although vague and indistinct, I yet recognised but\r\ntoo well. It was the Ash-tree. My beauty was the Maid of the Alder! and\r\nshe was giving me, spoiled of my only availing defence, into the hands\r\nof my awful foe. The Ash bent his Gorgon-head, and entered the cave. I\r\ncould not stir. He drew near me. His ghoul-eyes and his ghastly face\r\nfascinated me. He came stooping, with the hideous hand outstretched,\r\nlike a beast of prey. I had given myself up to a death of unfathomable\r\nhorror, when, suddenly, and just as he was on the point of seizing me,\r\nthe dull, heavy blow of an axe echoed through the wood, followed by\r\nothers in quick repetition. The Ash shuddered and groaned, withdrew the\r\noutstretched hand, retreated backwards to the mouth of the cave, then\r\nturned and disappeared amongst the trees. The other walking Death\r\nlooked at me once, with a careless dislike on her beautifully moulded\r\nfeatures; then, heedless any more to conceal her hollow deformity,\r\nturned her frightful back and likewise vanished amid the green\r\nobscurity without. I lay and wept. The Maid of the Alder-tree had\r\nbefooled me\xe2\x80\x94nearly slain me\xe2\x80\x94in spite of all the warnings I had received\r\nfrom those who knew my danger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFight on, my men, Sir Andrew sayes,\r\n    A little I am hurt, but yett not slaine;\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99le but lye downe and bleede awhile,\r\n    And then I\xe2\x80\x99le rise and fight againe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n          BALLAD _of Sir Andrew Barton_.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut I could not remain where I was any longer, though the daylight was\r\nhateful to me, and the thought of the great, innocent, bold sunrise\r\nunendurable. Here there was no well to cool my face, smarting with the\r\nbitterness of my own tears. Nor would I have washed in the well of that\r\ngrotto, had it flowed clear as the rivers of Paradise. I rose, and\r\nfeebly left the sepulchral cave. I took my way I knew not whither, but\r\nstill towards the sunrise. The birds were singing; but not for me. All\r\nthe creatures spoke a language of their own, with which I had nothing\r\nto do, and to which I cared not to find the key any more.\r\n\r\nI walked listlessly along. What distressed me most\xe2\x80\x94more even than my\r\nown folly\xe2\x80\x94was the perplexing question, How can beauty and ugliness\r\ndwell so near? Even with her altered complexion and her face of\r\ndislike; disenchanted of the belief that clung around her; known for a\r\nliving, walking sepulchre, faithless, deluding, traitorous; I felt\r\nnotwithstanding all this, that she was beautiful. Upon this I pondered\r\nwith undiminished perplexity, though not without some gain. Then I\r\nbegan to make surmises as to the mode of my deliverance; and concluded\r\nthat some hero, wandering in search of adventure, had heard how the\r\nforest was infested; and, knowing it was useless to attack the evil\r\nthing in person, had assailed with his battle-axe the body in which he\r\ndwelt, and on which he was dependent for his power of mischief in the\r\nwood. \xe2\x80\x9cVery likely,\xe2\x80\x9d I thought, \xe2\x80\x9cthe repentant-knight, who warned me of\r\nthe evil which has befallen me, was busy retrieving his lost honour,\r\nwhile I was sinking into the same sorrow with himself; and, hearing of\r\nthe dangerous and mysterious being, arrived at his tree in time to save\r\nme from being dragged to its roots, and buried like carrion, to nourish\r\nhim for yet deeper insatiableness.\xe2\x80\x9d I found afterwards that my\r\nconjecture was correct. I wondered how he had fared when his blows\r\nrecalled the Ash himself, and that too I learned afterwards.\r\n\r\nI walked on the whole day, with intervals of rest, but without food;\r\nfor I could not have eaten, had any been offered me; till, in the\r\nafternoon, I seemed to approach the outskirts of the forest, and at\r\nlength arrived at a farm-house. An unspeakable joy arose in my heart at\r\nbeholding an abode of human beings once more, and I hastened up to the\r\ndoor, and knocked. A kind-looking, matronly woman, still handsome, made\r\nher appearance; who, as soon as she saw me, said kindly, \xe2\x80\x9cAh, my poor\r\nboy, you have come from the wood! Were you in it last night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI should have ill endured, the day before, to be called _boy_; but now\r\nthe motherly kindness of the word went to my heart; and, like a boy\r\nindeed, I burst into tears. She soothed me right gently; and, leading\r\nme into a room, made me lie down on a settle, while she went to find me\r\nsome refreshment. She soon returned with food, but I could not eat. She\r\nalmost compelled me to swallow some wine, when I revived sufficiently\r\nto be able to answer some of her questions. I told her the whole story.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is just as I feared,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cbut you are now for the night\r\nbeyond the reach of any of these dreadful creatures. It is no wonder\r\nthey could delude a child like you. But I must beg you, when my husband\r\ncomes in, not to say a word about these things; for he thinks me even\r\nhalf crazy for believing anything of the sort. But I must believe my\r\nsenses, as he cannot believe beyond his, which give him no intimations\r\nof this kind. I think he could spend the whole of Midsummer-eve in the\r\nwood and come back with the report that he saw nothing worse than\r\nhimself. Indeed, good man, he would hardly find anything better than\r\nhimself, if he had seven more senses given him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut tell me how it is that she could be so beautiful without any heart\r\nat all\xe2\x80\x94without any place even for a heart to live in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot quite tell,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I am sure she would not look so\r\nbeautiful if she did not take means to make herself look more beautiful\r\nthan she is. And then, you know, you began by being in love with her\r\nbefore you saw her beauty, mistaking her for the lady of the\r\nmarble\xe2\x80\x94another kind altogether, I should think. But the chief thing\r\nthat makes her beautiful is this: that, although she loves no man, she\r\nloves the love of any man; and when she finds one in her power, her\r\ndesire to bewitch him and gain his love (not for the sake of his love\r\neither, but that she may be conscious anew of her own beauty, through\r\nthe admiration he manifests), makes her very lovely\xe2\x80\x94with a\r\nself-destructive beauty, though; for it is that which is constantly\r\nwearing her away within, till, at last, the decay will reach her face,\r\nand her whole front, when all the lovely mask of nothing will fall to\r\npieces, and she be vanished for ever. So a wise man, whom she met in\r\nthe wood some years ago, and who, I think, for all his wisdom, fared no\r\nbetter than you, told me, when, like you, he spent the next night here,\r\nand recounted to me his adventures.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI thanked her very warmly for her solution, though it was but partial;\r\nwondering much that in her, as in woman I met on my first entering the\r\nforest, there should be such superiority to her apparent condition.\r\nHere she left me to take some rest; though, indeed, I was too much\r\nagitated to rest in any other way than by simply ceasing to move.\r\n\r\nIn half an hour, I heard a heavy step approach and enter the house. A\r\njolly voice, whose slight huskiness appeared to proceed from overmuch\r\nlaughter, called out \xe2\x80\x9cBetsy, the pigs\xe2\x80\x99 trough is quite empty, and that\r\nis a pity. Let them swill, lass! They\xe2\x80\x99re of no use but to get fat. Ha!\r\nha! ha! Gluttony is not forbidden in their commandments. Ha! ha! ha!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThe very voice, kind and jovial, seemed to disrobe the room of the\r\nstrange look which all new places wear\xe2\x80\x94to disenchant it out of the\r\nrealm of the ideal into that of the actual. It began to look as if I\r\nhad known every corner of it for twenty years; and when, soon after,\r\nthe dame came and fetched me to partake of their early supper, the\r\ngrasp of his great hand, and the harvest-moon of his benevolent face,\r\nwhich was needed to light up the rotundity of the globe beneath it,\r\nproduced such a reaction in me, that, for a moment, I could hardly\r\nbelieve that there was a Fairy Land; and that all I had passed through\r\nsince I left home, had not been the wandering dream of a diseased\r\nimagination, operating on a too mobile frame, not merely causing me\r\nindeed to travel, but peopling for me with vague phantoms the regions\r\nthrough which my actual steps had led me. But the next moment my eye\r\nfell upon a little girl who was sitting in the chimney-corner, with a\r\nlittle book open on her knee, from which she had apparently just looked\r\nup to fix great inquiring eyes upon me. I believed in Fairy Land again.\r\nShe went on with her reading, as soon as she saw that I observed her\r\nlooking at me. I went near, and peeping over her shoulder, saw that she\r\nwas reading _The History of Graciosa and Percinet_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery improving book, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked the old farmer, with a\r\ngood-humoured laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are in the very hottest corner of Fairy Land\r\nhere. Ha! ha! Stormy night, last night, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas it, indeed?\xe2\x80\x9d I rejoined. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was not so with me. A lovelier night\r\nI never saw.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed! Where were you last night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI spent it in the forest. I had lost my way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! then, perhaps, you will be able to convince my good woman, that\r\nthere is nothing very remarkable about the forest; for, to tell the\r\ntruth, it bears but a bad name in these parts. I dare say you saw\r\nnothing worse than yourself there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope I did,\xe2\x80\x9d was my inward reply; but, for an audible one, I\r\ncontented myself with saying, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I certainly did see some\r\nappearances I could hardly account for; but that is nothing to be\r\nwondered at in an unknown wild forest, and with the uncertain light of\r\nthe moon alone to go by.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery true! you speak like a sensible man, sir. We have but few\r\nsensible folks round about us. Now, you would hardly credit it, but my\r\nwife believes every fairy-tale that ever was written. I cannot account\r\nfor it. She is a most sensible woman in everything else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut should not that make you treat her belief with something of\r\nrespect, though you cannot share in it yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that is all very well in theory; but when you come to live every\r\nday in the midst of absurdity, it is far less easy to behave\r\nrespectfully to it. Why, my wife actually believes the story of the\r\n\xe2\x80\x98White Cat.\xe2\x80\x99 You know it, I dare say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI read all these tales when a child, and know that one especially\r\nwell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, father,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed the little girl in the chimney-corner, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\r\nknow quite well that mother is descended from that very princess who\r\nwas changed by the wicked fairy into a white cat. Mother has told me so\r\na many times, and you ought to believe everything she says.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can easily believe that,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the farmer, with another fit of\r\nlaughter; \xe2\x80\x9cfor, the other night, a mouse came gnawing and scratching\r\nbeneath the floor, and would not let us go to sleep. Your mother sprang\r\nout of bed, and going as near it as she could, mewed so infernally like\r\na great cat, that the noise ceased instantly. I believe the poor mouse\r\ndied of the fright, for we have never heard it again. Ha! ha! ha!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe son, an ill-looking youth, who had entered during the conversation,\r\njoined in his father\xe2\x80\x99s laugh; but his laugh was very different from the\r\nold man\xe2\x80\x99s: it was polluted with a sneer. I watched him, and saw that,\r\nas soon as it was over, he looked scared, as if he dreaded some evil\r\nconsequences to follow his presumption. The woman stood near, waiting\r\ntill we should seat ourselves at the table, and listening to it all\r\nwith an amused air, which had something in it of the look with which\r\none listens to the sententious remarks of a pompous child. We sat down\r\nto supper, and I ate heartily. My bygone distresses began already to\r\nlook far off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn what direction are you going?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the old man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEastward,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied; nor could I have given a more definite answer.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes the forest extend much further in that direction?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! for miles and miles; I do not know how far. For although I have\r\nlived on the borders of it all my life, I have been too busy to make\r\njourneys of discovery into it. Nor do I see what I could discover. It\r\nis only trees and trees, till one is sick of them. By the way, if you\r\nfollow the eastward track from here, you will pass close to what the\r\nchildren say is the very house of the ogre that Hop-o\xe2\x80\x99-my-Thumb\r\nvisited, and ate his little daughters with the crowns of gold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, father! ate his little daughters! No; he only changed their gold\r\ncrowns for nightcaps; and the great long-toothed ogre killed them in\r\nmistake; but I do not think even he ate them, for you know they were\r\nhis own little ogresses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, child; you know all about it a great deal better than I\r\ndo. However, the house has, of course, in such a foolish neighbourhood\r\nas this, a bad enough name; and I must confess there is a woman living\r\nin it, with teeth long enough, and white enough too, for the lineal\r\ndescendant of the greatest ogre that ever was made. I think you had\r\nbetter not go near her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn such talk as this the night wore on. When supper was finished, which\r\nlasted some time, my hostess conducted me to my chamber.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you had not had enough of it already,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI would have put\r\nyou in another room, which looks towards the forest; and where you\r\nwould most likely have seen something more of its inhabitants. For they\r\nfrequently pass the window, and even enter the room sometimes. Strange\r\ncreatures spend whole nights in it, at certain seasons of the year. I\r\nam used to it, and do not mind it. No more does my little girl, who\r\nsleeps in it always. But this room looks southward towards the open\r\ncountry, and they never show themselves here; at least I never saw\r\nany.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was somewhat sorry not to gather any experience that I might have, of\r\nthe inhabitants of Fairy Land; but the effect of the farmer\xe2\x80\x99s company,\r\nand of my own later adventures, was such, that I chose rather an\r\nundisturbed night in my more human quarters; which, with their clean\r\nwhite curtains and white linen, were very inviting to my weariness.\r\n\r\nIn the morning I awoke refreshed, after a profound and dreamless sleep.\r\nThe sun was high, when I looked out of the window, shining over a wide,\r\nundulating, cultivated country. Various garden-vegetables were growing\r\nbeneath my window. Everything was radiant with clear sunlight. The\r\ndew-drops were sparkling their busiest; the cows in a near-by field\r\nwere eating as if they had not been at it all day yesterday; the maids\r\nwere singing at their work as they passed to and fro between the\r\nout-houses: I did not believe in Fairy Land. I went down, and found the\r\nfamily already at breakfast. But before I entered the room where they\r\nsat, the little girl came to me, and looked up in my face, as though\r\nshe wanted to say something to me. I stooped towards her; she put her\r\narms round my neck, and her mouth to my ear, and whispered\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA white lady has been flitting about the house all night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo whispering behind doors!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the farmer; and we entered\r\ntogether. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, how have you slept? No bogies, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot one, thank you; I slept uncommonly well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad to hear it. Come and breakfast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast, the farmer and his son went out; and I was left alone\r\nwith the mother and daughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I looked out of the window this morning,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cI felt almost\r\ncertain that Fairy Land was all a delusion of my brain; but whenever I\r\ncome near you or your little daughter, I feel differently. Yet I could\r\npersuade myself, after my last adventures, to go back, and have nothing\r\nmore to do with such strange beings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow will you go back?\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, that I do not know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I have heard, that, for those who enter Fairy Land, there is\r\nno way of going back. They must go on, and go through it. How, I do not\r\nin the least know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is quite the impression on my own mind. Something compels me to\r\ngo on, as if my only path was onward, but I feel less inclined this\r\nmorning to continue my adventures.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you come and see my little child\xe2\x80\x99s room? She sleeps in the one I\r\ntold you of, looking towards the forest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWillingly,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\nSo we went together, the little girl running before to open the door\r\nfor us. It was a large room, full of old-fashioned furniture, that\r\nseemed to have once belonged to some great house.\r\n\r\nThe window was built with a low arch, and filled with lozenge-shaped\r\npanes. The wall was very thick, and built of solid stone. I could see\r\nthat part of the house had been erected against the remains of some old\r\ncastle or abbey, or other great building; the fallen stones of which\r\nhad probably served to complete it. But as soon as I looked out of the\r\nwindow, a gush of wonderment and longing flowed over my soul like the\r\ntide of a great sea. Fairy Land lay before me, and drew me towards it\r\nwith an irresistible attraction. The trees bathed their great heads in\r\nthe waves of the morning, while their roots were planted deep in gloom;\r\nsave where on the borders the sunshine broke against their stems, or\r\nswept in long streams through their avenues, washing with brighter hue\r\nall the leaves over which it flowed; revealing the rich brown of the\r\ndecayed leaves and fallen pine-cones, and the delicate greens of the\r\nlong grasses and tiny forests of moss that covered the channel over\r\nwhich it passed in motionless rivers of light. I turned hurriedly to\r\nbid my hostess farewell without further delay. She smiled at my haste,\r\nbut with an anxious look.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had better not go near the house of the ogre, I think. My son will\r\nshow you into another path, which will join the first beyond it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNot wishing to be headstrong or too confident any more, I agreed; and\r\nhaving taken leave of my kind entertainers, went into the wood,\r\naccompanied by the youth. He scarcely spoke as we went along; but he\r\nled me through the trees till we struck upon a path. He told me to\r\nfollow it, and, with a muttered \xe2\x80\x9cgood morning\xe2\x80\x9d left me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am a part of the part, which at first was the whole.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n          GOETHE.\xe2\x80\x94_Mephistopheles in Faust_.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy spirits rose as I went deeper; into the forest; but I could not\r\nregain my former elasticity of mind. I found cheerfulness to be like\r\nlife itself\xe2\x80\x94not to be created by any argument. Afterwards I learned,\r\nthat the best way to manage some kinds of pain filled thoughts, is to\r\ndare them to do their worst; to let them lie and gnaw at your heart\r\ntill they are tired; and you find you still have a residue of life they\r\ncannot kill. So, better and worse, I went on, till I came to a little\r\nclearing in the forest. In the middle of this clearing stood a long,\r\nlow hut, built with one end against a single tall cypress, which rose\r\nlike a spire to the building. A vague misgiving crossed my mind when I\r\nsaw it; but I must needs go closer, and look through a little half-open\r\ndoor, near the opposite end from the cypress. Window I saw none. On\r\npeeping in, and looking towards the further end, I saw a lamp burning,\r\nwith a dim, reddish flame, and the head of a woman, bent downwards, as\r\nif reading by its light. I could see nothing more for a few moments. At\r\nlength, as my eyes got used to the dimness of the place, I saw that the\r\npart of the rude building near me was used for household purposes; for\r\nseveral rough utensils lay here and there, and a bed stood in the\r\ncorner.\r\n\r\nAn irresistible attraction caused me to enter. The woman never raised\r\nher face, the upper part of which alone I could see distinctly; but, as\r\nsoon as I stepped within the threshold, she began to read aloud, in a\r\nlow and not altogether unpleasing voice, from an ancient little volume\r\nwhich she held open with one hand on the table upon which stood the\r\nlamp. What she read was something like this:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo, then, as darkness had no beginning, neither will it ever have an\r\nend. So, then, is it eternal. The negation of aught else, is its\r\naffirmation. Where the light cannot come, there abideth the darkness.\r\nThe light doth but hollow a mine out of the infinite extension of the\r\ndarkness. And ever upon the steps of the light treadeth the darkness;\r\nyea, springeth in fountains and wells amidst it, from the secret\r\nchannels of its mighty sea. Truly, man is but a passing flame, moving\r\nunquietly amid the surrounding rest of night; without which he yet\r\ncould not be, and whereof he is in part compounded.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs I drew nearer, and she read on, she moved a little to turn a leaf of\r\nthe dark old volume, and I saw that her face was sallow and slightly\r\nforbidding. Her forehead was high, and her black eyes repressedly\r\nquiet. But she took no notice of me. This end of the cottage, if\r\ncottage it could be called, was destitute of furniture, except the\r\ntable with the lamp, and the chair on which the woman sat. In one\r\ncorner was a door, apparently of a cupboard in the wall, but which\r\nmight lead to a room beyond. Still the irresistible desire which had\r\nmade me enter the building urged me: I must open that door, and see\r\nwhat was beyond it. I approached, and laid my hand on the rude latch.\r\nThen the woman spoke, but without lifting her head or looking at me:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had better not open that door.\xe2\x80\x9d This was uttered quite quietly;\r\nand she went on with her reading, partly in silence, partly aloud; but\r\nboth modes seemed equally intended for herself alone. The prohibition,\r\nhowever, only increased my desire to see; and as she took no further\r\nnotice, I gently opened the door to its full width, and looked in. At\r\nfirst, I saw nothing worthy of attention. It seemed a common closet,\r\nwith shelves on each hand, on which stood various little necessaries\r\nfor the humble uses of a cottage. In one corner stood one or two\r\nbrooms, in another a hatchet and other common tools; showing that it\r\nwas in use every hour of the day for household purposes. But, as I\r\nlooked, I saw that there were no shelves at the back, and that an empty\r\nspace went in further; its termination appearing to be a faintly\r\nglimmering wall or curtain, somewhat less, however, than the width and\r\nheight of the doorway where I stood. But, as I continued looking, for a\r\nfew seconds, towards this faintly luminous limit, my eyes came into\r\ntrue relation with their object. All at once, with such a shiver as\r\nwhen one is suddenly conscious of the presence of another in a room\r\nwhere he has, for hours, considered himself alone, I saw that the\r\nseemingly luminous extremity was a sky, as of night, beheld through the\r\nlong perspective of a narrow, dark passage, through what, or built of\r\nwhat, I could not tell. As I gazed, I clearly discerned two or three\r\nstars glimmering faintly in the distant blue. But, suddenly, and as if\r\nit had been running fast from a far distance for this very point, and\r\nhad turned the corner without abating its swiftness, a dark figure sped\r\ninto and along the passage from the blue opening at the remote end. I\r\nstarted back and shuddered, but kept looking, for I could not help it.\r\nOn and on it came, with a speedy approach but delayed arrival; till, at\r\nlast, through the many gradations of approach, it seemed to come within\r\nthe sphere of myself, rushed up to me, and passed me into the cottage.\r\nAll I could tell of its appearance was, that it seemed to be a dark\r\nhuman figure. Its motion was entirely noiseless, and might be called a\r\ngliding, were it not that it appeared that of a runner, but with\r\nghostly feet. I had moved back yet a little to let him pass me, and\r\nlooked round after him instantly. I could not see him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is he?\xe2\x80\x9d I said, in some alarm, to the woman, who still sat\r\nreading.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, on the floor, behind you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, pointing with her arm\r\nhalf-outstretched, but not lifting her eyes. I turned and looked, but\r\nsaw nothing. Then with a feeling that there was yet something behind\r\nme, I looked round over my shoulder; and there, on the ground, lay a\r\nblack shadow, the size of a man. It was so dark, that I could see it in\r\nthe dim light of the lamp, which shone full upon it, apparently without\r\nthinning at all the intensity of its hue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman, \xe2\x80\x9cyou had better not look into that\r\ncloset.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d I said, with a growing sense of horror.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is only your shadow that has found you,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied. \xe2\x80\x9cEverybody\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshadow is ranging up and down looking for him. I believe you call it by\r\na different name in your world: yours has found you, as every person\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nis almost certain to do who looks into that closet, especially after\r\nmeeting one in the forest, whom I dare say you have met.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere, for the first time, she lifted her head, and looked full at me:\r\nher mouth was full of long, white, shining teeth; and I knew that I was\r\nin the house of the ogre. I could not speak, but turned and left the\r\nhouse, with the shadow at my heels. \xe2\x80\x9cA nice sort of valet to have,\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nsaid to myself bitterly, as I stepped into the sunshine, and, looking\r\nover my shoulder, saw that it lay yet blacker in the full blaze of the\r\nsunlight. Indeed, only when I stood between it and the sun, was the\r\nblackness at all diminished. I was so bewildered\xe2\x80\x94stunned\xe2\x80\x94both by the\r\nevent itself and its suddenness, that I could not at all realise to\r\nmyself what it would be to have such a constant and strange attendance;\r\nbut with a dim conviction that my present dislike would soon grow to\r\nloathing, I took my dreary way through the wood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO lady! we receive but what we give,\r\nAnd in our life alone does nature live:\r\nOurs is her wedding garments ours her shroud!\r\n.  .  .  .  .\r\n    Ah! from the soul itself must issue forth,\r\nA light, a glory, a fair luminous cloud,\r\n    Enveloping the Earth\xe2\x80\x94\r\nAnd from the soul itself must there be sent\r\n    A sweet and potent voice of its own birth,\r\nOf all sweet sounds the life and element!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n          COLERIDGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom this time, until I arrived at the palace of Fairy Land, I can\r\nattempt no consecutive account of my wanderings and adventures.\r\nEverything, henceforward, existed for me in its relation to my\r\nattendant. What influence he exercised upon everything into contact\r\nwith which I was brought, may be understood from a few detached\r\ninstances. To begin with this very day on which he first joined me:\r\nafter I had walked heartlessly along for two or three hours, I was very\r\nweary, and lay down to rest in a most delightful part of the forest,\r\ncarpeted with wild flowers. I lay for half an hour in a dull repose,\r\nand then got up to pursue my way. The flowers on the spot where I had\r\nlain were crushed to the earth: but I saw that they would soon lift\r\ntheir heads and rejoice again in the sun and air. Not so those on which\r\nmy shadow had lain. The very outline of it could be traced in the\r\nwithered lifeless grass, and the scorched and shrivelled flowers which\r\nstood there, dead, and hopeless of any resurrection. I shuddered, and\r\nhastened away with sad forebodings.\r\n\r\nIn a few days, I had reason to dread an extension of its baleful\r\ninfluences from the fact, that it was no longer confined to one\r\nposition in regard to myself. Hitherto, when seized with an\r\nirresistible desire to look on my evil demon (which longing would\r\nunaccountably seize me at any moment, returning at longer or shorter\r\nintervals, sometimes every minute), I had to turn my head backwards,\r\nand look over my shoulder; in which position, as long as I could retain\r\nit, I was fascinated. But one day, having come out on a clear grassy\r\nhill, which commanded a glorious prospect, though of what I cannot now\r\ntell, my shadow moved round, and came in front of me. And, presently, a\r\nnew manifestation increased my distress. For it began to coruscate, and\r\nshoot out on all sides a radiation of dim shadow. These rays of gloom\r\nissued from the central shadow as from a black sun, lengthening and\r\nshortening with continual change. But wherever a ray struck, that part\r\nof earth, or sea, or sky, became void, and desert, and sad to my heart.\r\nOn this, the first development of its new power, one ray shot out\r\nbeyond the rest, seeming to lengthen infinitely, until it smote the\r\ngreat sun on the face, which withered and darkened beneath the blow. I\r\nturned away and went on. The shadow retreated to its former position;\r\nand when I looked again, it had drawn in all its spears of darkness,\r\nand followed like a dog at my heels.\r\n\r\nOnce, as I passed by a cottage, there came out a lovely fairy child,\r\nwith two wondrous toys, one in each hand. The one was the tube through\r\nwhich the fairy-gifted poet looks when he beholds the same thing\r\neverywhere; the other that through which he looks when he combines into\r\nnew forms of loveliness those images of beauty which his own choice has\r\ngathered from all regions wherein he has travelled. Round the child\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhead was an aureole of emanating rays. As I looked at him in wonder and\r\ndelight, round crept from behind me the something dark, and the child\r\nstood in my shadow. Straightway he was a commonplace boy, with a rough\r\nbroad-brimmed straw hat, through which brim the sun shone from behind.\r\nThe toys he carried were a multiplying-glass and a kaleidoscope. I\r\nsighed and departed.\r\n\r\nOne evening, as a great silent flood of western gold flowed through an\r\navenue in the woods, down the stream, just as when I saw him first,\r\ncame the sad knight, riding on his chestnut steed.\r\n\r\nBut his armour did not shine half so red as when I saw him first.\r\n\r\nMany a blow of mighty sword and axe, turned aside by the strength of\r\nhis mail, and glancing adown the surface, had swept from its path the\r\nfretted rust, and the glorious steel had answered the kindly blow with\r\nthe thanks of returning light. These streaks and spots made his armour\r\nlook like the floor of a forest in the sunlight. His forehead was\r\nhigher than before, for the contracting wrinkles were nearly gone; and\r\nthe sadness that remained on his face was the sadness of a dewy summer\r\ntwilight, not that of a frosty autumn morn. He, too, had met the\r\nAlder-maiden as I, but he had plunged into the torrent of mighty deeds,\r\nand the stain was nearly washed away. No shadow followed him. He had\r\nnot entered the dark house; he had not had time to open the closet\r\ndoor. \xe2\x80\x9cWill he ever look in?\xe2\x80\x9d I said to myself. \xe2\x80\x9c_Must_ his shadow find\r\nhim some day?\xe2\x80\x9d But I could not answer my own questions.\r\n\r\nWe travelled together for two days, and I began to love him. It was\r\nplain that he suspected my story in some degree; and I saw him once or\r\ntwice looking curiously and anxiously at my attendant gloom, which all\r\nthis time had remained very obsequiously behind me; but I offered no\r\nexplanation, and he asked none. Shame at my neglect of his warning, and\r\na horror which shrunk from even alluding to its cause, kept me silent;\r\ntill, on the evening of the second day, some noble words from my\r\ncompanion roused all my heart; and I was at the point of falling on his\r\nneck, and telling him the whole story; seeking, if not for helpful\r\nadvice, for of that I was hopeless, yet for the comfort of\r\nsympathy\xe2\x80\x94when round slid the shadow and inwrapt my friend; and I could\r\nnot trust him.\r\n\r\nThe glory of his brow vanished; the light of his eye grew cold; and I\r\nheld my peace. The next morning we parted.\r\n\r\nBut the most dreadful thing of all was, that I now began to feel\r\nsomething like satisfaction in the presence of the shadow. I began to\r\nbe rather vain of my attendant, saying to myself, \xe2\x80\x9cIn a land like this,\r\nwith so many illusions everywhere, I need his aid to disenchant the\r\nthings around me. He does away with all appearances, and shows me\r\nthings in their true colour and form. And I am not one to be fooled\r\nwith the vanities of the common crowd. I will not see beauty where\r\nthere is none. I will dare to behold things as they are. And if I live\r\nin a waste instead of a paradise, I will live knowing where I live.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nBut of this a certain exercise of his power which soon followed quite\r\ncured me, turning my feelings towards him once more into loathing and\r\ndistrust. It was thus:\r\n\r\nOne bright noon, a little maiden joined me, coming through the wood in\r\na direction at right angles to my path. She came along singing and\r\ndancing, happy as a child, though she seemed almost a woman. In her\r\nhands\xe2\x80\x94now in one, now in another\xe2\x80\x94she carried a small globe, bright and\r\nclear as the purest crystal. This seemed at once her plaything and her\r\ngreatest treasure. At one moment, you would have thought her utterly\r\ncareless of it, and at another, overwhelmed with anxiety for its\r\nsafety. But I believe she was taking care of it all the time, perhaps\r\nnot least when least occupied about it. She stopped by me with a smile,\r\nand bade me good day with the sweetest voice. I felt a wonderful liking\r\nto the child\xe2\x80\x94for she produced on me more the impression of a child,\r\nthough my understanding told me differently. We talked a little, and\r\nthen walked on together in the direction I had been pursuing. I asked\r\nher about the globe she carried, but getting no definite answer, I held\r\nout my hand to take it. She drew back, and said, but smiling almost\r\ninvitingly the while, \xe2\x80\x9cYou must not touch it;\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94then, after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npause\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cOr if you do, it must be very gently.\xe2\x80\x9d I touched it with a\r\nfinger. A slight vibratory motion arose in it, accompanied, or perhaps\r\nmanifested, by a faint sweet sound. I touched it again, and the sound\r\nincreased. I touched it the third time: a tiny torrent of harmony\r\nrolled out of the little globe. She would not let me touch it any more.\r\n\r\nWe travelled on together all that day. She left me when twilight came\r\non; but next day, at noon, she met me as before, and again we travelled\r\ntill evening. The third day she came once more at noon, and we walked\r\non together. Now, though we had talked about a great many things\r\nconnected with Fairy Land, and the life she had led hitherto, I had\r\nnever been able to learn anything about the globe. This day, however,\r\nas we went on, the shadow glided round and inwrapt the maiden. It could\r\nnot change her. But my desire to know about the globe, which in his\r\ngloom began to waver as with an inward light, and to shoot out flashes\r\nof many-coloured flame, grew irresistible. I put out both my hands and\r\nlaid hold of it. It began to sound as before. The sound rapidly\r\nincreased, till it grew a low tempest of harmony, and the globe\r\ntrembled, and quivered, and throbbed between my hands. I had not the\r\nheart to pull it away from the maiden, though I held it in spite of her\r\nattempts to take it from me; yes, I shame to say, in spite of her\r\nprayers, and, at last, her tears. The music went on growing in,\r\nintensity and complication of tones, and the globe vibrated and heaved;\r\ntill at last it burst in our hands, and a black vapour broke upwards\r\nfrom out of it; then turned, as if blown sideways, and enveloped the\r\nmaiden, hiding even the shadow in its blackness. She held fast the\r\nfragments, which I abandoned, and fled from me into the forest in the\r\ndirection whence she had come, wailing like a child, and crying, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nhave broken my globe; my globe is broken\xe2\x80\x94my globe is broken!\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nfollowed her, in the hope of comforting her; but had not pursued her\r\nfar, before a sudden cold gust of wind bowed the tree-tops above us,\r\nand swept through their stems around us; a great cloud overspread the\r\nday, and a fierce tempest came on, in which I lost sight of her. It\r\nlies heavy on my heart to this hour. At night, ere I fall asleep,\r\noften, whatever I may be thinking about, I suddenly hear her voice,\r\ncrying out, \xe2\x80\x9cYou have broken my globe; my globe is broken; ah, my\r\nglobe!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere I will mention one more strange thing; but whether this\r\npeculiarity was owing to my shadow at all, I am not able to assure\r\nmyself. I came to a village, the inhabitants of which could not at\r\nfirst sight be distinguished from the dwellers in our land. They rather\r\navoided than sought my company, though they were very pleasant when I\r\naddressed them. But at last I observed, that whenever I came within a\r\ncertain distance of any one of them, which distance, however, varied\r\nwith different individuals, the whole appearance of the person began to\r\nchange; and this change increased in degree as I approached. When I\r\nreceded to the former distance, the former appearance was restored. The\r\nnature of the change was grotesque, following no fixed rule. The\r\nnearest resemblance to it that I know, is the distortion produced in\r\nyour countenance when you look at it as reflected in a concave or\r\nconvex surface\xe2\x80\x94say, either side of a bright spoon. Of this phenomenon I\r\nfirst became aware in rather a ludicrous way. My host\xe2\x80\x99s daughter was a\r\nvery pleasant pretty girl, who made herself more agreeable to me than\r\nmost of those about me. For some days my companion-shadow had been less\r\nobtrusive than usual; and such was the reaction of spirits occasioned\r\nby the simple mitigation of torment, that, although I had cause enough\r\nbesides to be gloomy, I felt light and comparatively happy. My\r\nimpression is, that she was quite aware of the law of appearances that\r\nexisted between the people of the place and myself, and had resolved to\r\namuse herself at my expense; for one evening, after some jesting and\r\nraillery, she, somehow or other, provoked me to attempt to kiss her.\r\nBut she was well defended from any assault of the kind. Her countenance\r\nbecame, of a sudden, absurdly hideous; the pretty mouth was elongated\r\nand otherwise amplified sufficiently to have allowed of six\r\nsimultaneous kisses. I started back in bewildered dismay; she burst\r\ninto the merriest fit of laughter, and ran from the room. I soon found\r\nthat the same undefinable law of change operated between me and all the\r\nother villagers; and that, to feel I was in pleasant company, it was\r\nabsolutely necessary for me to discover and observe the right focal\r\ndistance between myself and each one with whom I had to do. This done,\r\nall went pleasantly enough. Whether, when I happened to neglect this\r\nprecaution, I presented to them an equally ridiculous appearance, I did\r\nnot ascertain; but I presume that the alteration was common to the\r\napproximating parties. I was likewise unable to determine whether I was\r\na necessary party to the production of this strange transformation, or\r\nwhether it took place as well, under the given circumstances, between\r\nthe inhabitants themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom Eden\xe2\x80\x99s bowers the full-fed rivers flow,\r\nTo guide the outcasts to the land of woe:\r\nOur Earth one little toiling streamlet yields.\r\nTo guide the wanderers to the happy fields.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter leaving this village, where I had rested for nearly a week, I\r\ntravelled through a desert region of dry sand and glittering rocks,\r\npeopled principally by goblin-fairies. When I first entered their\r\ndomains, and, indeed, whenever I fell in with another tribe of them,\r\nthey began mocking me with offered handfuls of gold and jewels, making\r\nhideous grimaces at me, and performing the most antic homage, as if\r\nthey thought I expected reverence, and meant to humour me like a\r\nmaniac. But ever, as soon as one cast his eyes on the shadow behind me,\r\nhe made a wry face, partly of pity, partly of contempt, and looked\r\nashamed, as if he had been caught doing something inhuman; then,\r\nthrowing down his handful of gold, and ceasing all his grimaces, he\r\nstood aside to let me pass in peace, and made signs to his companions\r\nto do the like. I had no inclination to observe them much, for the\r\nshadow was in my heart as well as at my heels. I walked listlessly and\r\nalmost hopelessly along, till I arrived one day at a small spring;\r\nwhich, bursting cool from the heart of a sun-heated rock, flowed\r\nsomewhat southwards from the direction I had been taking. I drank of\r\nthis spring, and found myself wonderfully refreshed. A kind of love to\r\nthe cheerful little stream arose in my heart. It was born in a desert;\r\nbut it seemed to say to itself, \xe2\x80\x9cI will flow, and sing, and lave my\r\nbanks, till I make my desert a paradise.\xe2\x80\x9d I thought I could not do\r\nbetter than follow it, and see what it made of it. So down with the\r\nstream I went, over rocky lands, burning with sunbeams. But the rivulet\r\nflowed not far, before a few blades of grass appeared on its banks, and\r\nthen, here and there, a stunted bush. Sometimes it disappeared\r\naltogether under ground; and after I had wandered some distance, as\r\nnear as I could guess, in the direction it seemed to take, I would\r\nsuddenly hear it again, singing, sometimes far away to my right or\r\nleft, amongst new rocks, over which it made new cataracts of watery\r\nmelodies. The verdure on its banks increased as it flowed; other\r\nstreams joined it; and at last, after many days\xe2\x80\x99 travel, I found\r\nmyself, one gorgeous summer evening, resting by the side of a broad\r\nriver, with a glorious horse-chestnut tree towering above me, and\r\ndropping its blossoms, milk-white and rosy-red, all about me. As I sat,\r\na gush of joy sprang forth in my heart, and over flowed at my eyes.\r\n\r\nThrough my tears, the whole landscape glimmered in such bewildering\r\nloveliness, that I felt as if I were entering Fairy Land for the first\r\ntime, and some loving hand were waiting to cool my head, and a loving\r\nword to warm my heart. Roses, wild roses, everywhere! So plentiful were\r\nthey, they not only perfumed the air, they seemed to dye it a faint\r\nrose-hue. The colour floated abroad with the scent, and clomb, and\r\nspread, until the whole west blushed and glowed with the gathered\r\nincense of roses. And my heart fainted with longing in my bosom.\r\n\r\nCould I but see the Spirit of the Earth, as I saw once the indwelling\r\nwoman of the beech-tree, and my beauty of the pale marble, I should be\r\ncontent. Content!\xe2\x80\x94Oh, how gladly would I die of the light of her eyes!\r\nYea, I would cease to be, if that would bring me one word of love from\r\nthe one mouth. The twilight sank around, and infolded me with sleep. I\r\nslept as I had not slept for months. I did not awake till late in the\r\nmorning; when, refreshed in body and mind, I rose as from the death\r\nthat wipes out the sadness of life, and then dies itself in the new\r\nmorrow. Again I followed the stream; now climbing a steep rocky bank\r\nthat hemmed it in; now wading through long grasses and wild flowers in\r\nits path; now through meadows; and anon through woods that crowded down\r\nto the very lip of the water.\r\n\r\nAt length, in a nook of the river, gloomy with the weight of\r\noverhanging foliage, and still and deep as a soul in which the torrent\r\neddies of pain have hollowed a great gulf, and then, subsiding in\r\nviolence, have left it full of a motionless, fathomless sorrow\xe2\x80\x94I saw a\r\nlittle boat lying. So still was the water here, that the boat needed no\r\nfastening. It lay as if some one had just stepped ashore, and would in\r\na moment return. But as there were no signs of presence, and no track\r\nthrough the thick bushes; and, moreover, as I was in Fairy Land where\r\none does very much as he pleases, I forced my way to the brink, stepped\r\ninto the boat, pushed it, with the help of the tree-branches, out into\r\nthe stream, lay down in the bottom, and let my boat and me float\r\nwhither the stream would carry us. I seemed to lose myself in the great\r\nflow of sky above me unbroken in its infinitude, except when now and\r\nthen, coming nearer the shore at a bend in the river, a tree would\r\nsweep its mighty head silently above mine, and glide away back into the\r\npast, never more to fling its shadow over me. I fell asleep in this\r\ncradle, in which mother Nature was rocking her weary child; and while I\r\nslept, the sun slept not, but went round his arched way. When I awoke,\r\nhe slept in the waters, and I went on my silent path beneath a round\r\nsilvery moon. And a pale moon looked up from the floor of the great\r\nblue cave that lay in the abysmal silence beneath.\r\n\r\nWhy are all reflections lovelier than what we call the reality?\xe2\x80\x94not so\r\ngrand or so strong, it may be, but always lovelier? Fair as is the\r\ngliding sloop on the shining sea, the wavering, trembling, unresting\r\nsail below is fairer still. Yea, the reflecting ocean itself, reflected\r\nin the mirror, has a wondrousness about its waters that somewhat\r\nvanishes when I turn towards itself. All mirrors are magic mirrors. The\r\ncommonest room is a room in a poem when I turn to the glass. (And this\r\nreminds me, while I write, of a strange story which I read in the fairy\r\npalace, and of which I will try to make a feeble memorial in its\r\nplace.) In whatever way it may be accounted for, of one thing we may be\r\nsure, that this feeling is no cheat; for there is no cheating in nature\r\nand the simple unsought feelings of the soul. There must be a truth\r\ninvolved in it, though we may but in part lay hold of the meaning. Even\r\nthe memories of past pain are beautiful; and past delights, though\r\nbeheld only through clefts in the grey clouds of sorrow, are lovely as\r\nFairy Land. But how have I wandered into the deeper fairyland of the\r\nsoul, while as yet I only float towards the fairy palace of Fairy Land!\r\nThe moon, which is the lovelier memory or reflex of the down-gone sun,\r\nthe joyous day seen in the faint mirror of the brooding night, had rapt\r\nme away.\r\n\r\nI sat up in the boat. Gigantic forest trees were about me; through\r\nwhich, like a silver snake, twisted and twined the great river. The\r\nlittle waves, when I moved in the boat, heaved and fell with a plash as\r\nof molten silver, breaking the image of the moon into a thousand\r\nmorsels, fusing again into one, as the ripples of laughter die into the\r\nstill face of joy. The sleeping woods, in undefined massiveness; the\r\nwater that flowed in its sleep; and, above all, the enchantress moon,\r\nwhich had cast them all, with her pale eye, into the charmed slumber,\r\nsank into my soul, and I felt as if I had died in a dream, and should\r\nnever more awake.\r\n\r\nFrom this I was partly aroused by a glimmering of white, that, through\r\nthe trees on the left, vaguely crossed my vision, as I gazed upwards.\r\nBut the trees again hid the object; and at the moment, some strange\r\nmelodious bird took up its song, and sang, not an ordinary bird-song,\r\nwith constant repetitions of the same melody, but what sounded like a\r\ncontinuous strain, in which one thought was expressed, deepening in\r\nintensity as evolved in progress. It sounded like a welcome already\r\novershadowed with the coming farewell. As in all sweetest music, a\r\ntinge of sadness was in every note. Nor do we know how much of the\r\npleasures even of life we owe to the intermingled sorrows. Joy cannot\r\nunfold the deepest truths, although deepest truth must be deepest joy.\r\nCometh white-robed Sorrow, stooping and wan, and flingeth wide the\r\ndoors she may not enter. Almost we linger with Sorrow for very love.\r\n\r\nAs the song concluded the stream bore my little boat with a gentle\r\nsweep round a bend of the river; and lo! on a broad lawn, which rose\r\nfrom the water\xe2\x80\x99s edge with a long green slope to a clear elevation from\r\nwhich the trees receded on all sides, stood a stately palace glimmering\r\nghostly in the moonshine: it seemed to be built throughout of the\r\nwhitest marble. There was no reflection of moonlight from windows\xe2\x80\x94there\r\nseemed to be none; so there was no cold glitter; only, as I said, a\r\nghostly shimmer. Numberless shadows tempered the shine, from column and\r\nbalcony and tower. For everywhere galleries ran along the face of the\r\nbuildings; wings were extended in many directions; and numberless\r\nopenings, through which the moonbeams vanished into the interior, and\r\nwhich served both for doors and windows, had their separate balconies\r\nin front, communicating with a common gallery that rose on its own\r\npillars. Of course, I did not discover all this from the river, and in\r\nthe moonlight. But, though I was there for many days, I did not succeed\r\nin mastering the inner topography of the building, so extensive and\r\ncomplicated was it.\r\n\r\nHere I wished to land, but the boat had no oars on board. However, I\r\nfound that a plank, serving for a seat, was unfastened, and with that I\r\nbrought the boat to the bank and scrambled on shore. Deep soft turf\r\nsank beneath my feet, as I went up the ascent towards the palace.\r\n\r\nWhen I reached it, I saw that it stood on a great platform of marble,\r\nwith an ascent, by broad stairs of the same, all round it. Arrived on\r\nthe platform, I found there was an extensive outlook over the forest,\r\nwhich, however, was rather veiled than revealed by the moonlight.\r\n\r\nEntering by a wide gateway, but without gates, into an inner court,\r\nsurrounded on all sides by great marble pillars supporting galleries\r\nabove, I saw a large fountain of porphyry in the middle, throwing up a\r\nlofty column of water, which fell, with a noise as of the fusion of all\r\nsweet sounds, into a basin beneath; overflowing which, it ran into a\r\nsingle channel towards the interior of the building. Although the moon\r\nwas by this time so low in the west, that not a ray of her light fell\r\ninto the court, over the height of the surrounding buildings; yet was\r\nthe court lighted by a second reflex from the sun of other lands. For\r\nthe top of the column of water, just as it spread to fall, caught the\r\nmoonbeams, and like a great pale lamp, hung high in the night air,\r\nthrew a dim memory of light (as it were) over the court below. This\r\ncourt was paved in diamonds of white and red marble. According to my\r\ncustom since I entered Fairy Land, of taking for a guide whatever I\r\nfirst found moving in any direction, I followed the stream from the\r\nbasin of the fountain. It led me to a great open door, beneath the\r\nascending steps of which it ran through a low arch and disappeared.\r\nEntering here, I found myself in a great hall, surrounded with white\r\npillars, and paved with black and white. This I could see by the\r\nmoonlight, which, from the other side, streamed through open windows\r\ninto the hall.\r\n\r\nIts height I could not distinctly see. As soon as I entered, I had the\r\nfeeling so common to me in the woods, that there were others there\r\nbesides myself, though I could see no one, and heard no sound to\r\nindicate a presence. Since my visit to the Church of Darkness, my power\r\nof seeing the fairies of the higher orders had gradually diminished,\r\nuntil it had almost ceased. But I could frequently believe in their\r\npresence while unable to see them. Still, although I had company, and\r\ndoubtless of a safe kind, it seemed rather dreary to spend the night in\r\nan empty marble hall, however beautiful, especially as the moon was\r\nnear the going down, and it would soon be dark. So I began at the place\r\nwhere I entered, and walked round the hall, looking for some door or\r\npassage that might lead me to a more hospitable chamber. As I walked, I\r\nwas deliciously haunted with the feeling that behind some one of the\r\nseemingly innumerable pillars, one who loved me was waiting for me.\r\nThen I thought she was following me from pillar to pillar as I went\r\nalong; but no arms came out of the faint moonlight, and no sigh assured\r\nme of her presence.\r\n\r\nAt length I came to an open corridor, into which I turned;\r\nnotwithstanding that, in doing so, I left the light behind. Along this\r\nI walked with outstretched hands, groping my way, till, arriving at\r\nanother corridor, which seemed to strike off at right angles to that in\r\nwhich I was, I saw at the end a faintly glimmering light, too pale even\r\nfor moonshine, resembling rather a stray phosphorescence. However,\r\nwhere everything was white, a little light went a great way. So I\r\nwalked on to the end, and a long corridor it was. When I came up to the\r\nlight, I found that it proceeded from what looked like silver letters\r\nupon a door of ebony; and, to my surprise even in the home of wonder\r\nitself, the letters formed the words, _The Chamber of Sir Anodos_.\r\nAlthough I had as yet no right to the honours of a knight, I ventured\r\nto conclude that the chamber was indeed intended for me; and, opening\r\nthe door without hesitation, I entered. Any doubt as to whether I was\r\nright in so doing, was soon dispelled. What to my dark eyes seemed a\r\nblaze of light, burst upon me. A fire of large pieces of some\r\nsweet-scented wood, supported by dogs of silver, was burning on the\r\nhearth, and a bright lamp stood on a table, in the midst of a plentiful\r\nmeal, apparently awaiting my arrival. But what surprised me more than\r\nall, was, that the room was in every respect a copy of my own room, the\r\nroom whence the little stream from my basin had led me into Fairy Land.\r\nThere was the very carpet of grass and moss and daisies, which I had\r\nmyself designed; the curtains of pale blue silk, that fell like a\r\ncataract over the windows; the old-fashioned bed, with the chintz\r\nfurniture, on which I had slept from boyhood. \xe2\x80\x9cNow I shall sleep,\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nsaid to myself. \xe2\x80\x9cMy shadow dares not come here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI sat down to the table, and began to help myself to the good things\r\nbefore me with confidence. And now I found, as in many instances\r\nbefore, how true the fairy tales are; for I was waited on, all the time\r\nof my meal, by invisible hands. I had scarcely to do more than look\r\ntowards anything I wanted, when it was brought me, just as if it had\r\ncome to me of itself. My glass was kept filled with the wine I had\r\nchosen, until I looked towards another bottle or decanter; when a fresh\r\nglass was substituted, and the other wine supplied. When I had eaten\r\nand drank more heartily and joyfully than ever since I entered Fairy\r\nLand, the whole was removed by several attendants, of whom some were\r\nmale and some female, as I thought I could distinguish from the way the\r\ndishes were lifted from the table, and the motion with which they were\r\ncarried out of the room. As soon as they were all taken away, I heard a\r\nsound as of the shutting of a door, and knew that I was left alone. I\r\nsat long by the fire, meditating, and wondering how it would all end;\r\nand when at length, wearied with thinking, I betook myself to my own\r\nbed, it was half with a hope that, when I awoke in the morning, I\r\nshould awake not only in my own room, but in my own castle also; and\r\nthat I should walk, out upon my own native soil, and find that Fairy\r\nLand was, after all, only a vision of the night. The sound of the\r\nfalling waters of the fountain floated me into oblivion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA wilderness of building, sinking far\r\nAnd self-withdrawn into a wondrous depth,\r\nFar sinking into splendour\xe2\x80\x94without end:\r\nFabric it seemed of diamond and of gold,\r\nWith alabaster domes, and silver spires,\r\nAnd blazing terrace upon terrace, high\r\nUplifted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n          WORDSWORTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut when, after a sleep, which, although dreamless, yet left behind it\r\na sense of past blessedness, I awoke in the full morning, I found,\r\nindeed, that the room was still my own; but that it looked abroad upon\r\nan unknown landscape of forest and hill and dale on the one side\xe2\x80\x94and on\r\nthe other, upon the marble court, with the great fountain, the crest of\r\nwhich now flashed glorious in the sun, and cast on the pavement beneath\r\na shower of faint shadows from the waters that fell from it into the\r\nmarble basin below.\r\n\r\nAgreeably to all authentic accounts of the treatment of travellers in\r\nFairy Land, I found by my bedside a complete suit of fresh clothing,\r\njust such as I was in the habit of wearing; for, though varied\r\nsufficiently from the one removed, it was yet in complete accordance\r\nwith my tastes. I dressed myself in this, and went out. The whole\r\npalace shone like silver in the sun. The marble was partly dull and\r\npartly polished; and every pinnacle, dome, and turret ended in a ball,\r\nor cone, or cusp of silver. It was like frost-work, and too dazzling,\r\nin the sun, for earthly eyes like mine.\r\n\r\nI will not attempt to describe the environs, save by saying, that all\r\nthe pleasures to be found in the most varied and artistic arrangement\r\nof wood and river, lawn and wild forest, garden and shrubbery, rocky\r\nhill and luxurious vale; in living creatures wild and tame, in gorgeous\r\nbirds, scattered fountains, little streams, and reedy lakes\xe2\x80\x94all were\r\nhere. Some parts of the palace itself I shall have occasion to describe\r\nmore minutely.\r\n\r\nFor this whole morning I never thought of my demon shadow; and not till\r\nthe weariness which supervened on delight brought it again to my\r\nmemory, did I look round to see if it was behind me: it was scarcely\r\ndiscernible. But its presence, however faintly revealed, sent a pang to\r\nmy heart, for the pain of which, not all the beauties around me could\r\ncompensate. It was followed, however, by the comforting reflection\r\nthat, peradventure, I might here find the magic word of power to banish\r\nthe demon and set me free, so that I should no longer be a man beside\r\nmyself. The Queen of Fairy Land, thought I, must dwell here: surely she\r\nwill put forth her power to deliver me, and send me singing through the\r\nfurther gates of her country back to my own land. \xe2\x80\x9cShadow of me!\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nsaid; \xe2\x80\x9cwhich art not me, but which representest thyself to me as me;\r\nhere I may find a shadow of light which will devour thee, the shadow of\r\ndarkness! Here I may find a blessing which will fall on thee as a\r\ncurse, and damn thee to the blackness whence thou hast emerged\r\nunbidden.\xe2\x80\x9d I said this, stretched at length on the slope of the lawn\r\nabove the river; and as the hope arose within me, the sun came forth\r\nfrom a light fleecy cloud that swept across his face; and hill and\r\ndale, and the great river winding on through the still mysterious\r\nforest, flashed back his rays as with a silent shout of joy; all nature\r\nlived and glowed; the very earth grew warm beneath me; a magnificent\r\ndragon-fly went past me like an arrow from a bow, and a whole concert\r\nof birds burst into choral song.\r\n\r\nThe heat of the sun soon became too intense even for passive support. I\r\ntherefore rose, and sought the shelter of one of the arcades. Wandering\r\nalong from one to another of these, wherever my heedless steps led me,\r\nand wondering everywhere at the simple magnificence of the building, I\r\narrived at another hall, the roof of which was of a pale blue, spangled\r\nwith constellations of silver stars, and supported by porphyry pillars\r\nof a paler red than ordinary.\xe2\x80\x94In this house (I may remark in passing),\r\nsilver seemed everywhere preferred to gold; and such was the purity of\r\nthe air, that it showed nowhere signs of tarnishing.\xe2\x80\x94The whole of the\r\nfloor of this hall, except a narrow path behind the pillars, paved with\r\nblack, was hollowed into a huge basin, many feet deep, and filled with\r\nthe purest, most liquid and radiant water. The sides of the basin were\r\nwhite marble, and the bottom was paved with all kinds of refulgent\r\nstones, of every shape and hue.\r\n\r\nIn their arrangement, you would have supposed, at first sight, that\r\nthere was no design, for they seemed to lie as if cast there from\r\ncareless and playful hands; but it was a most harmonious confusion; and\r\nas I looked at the play of their colours, especially when the waters\r\nwere in motion, I came at last to feel as if not one little pebble\r\ncould be displaced, without injuring the effect of the whole. Beneath\r\nthis floor of the water, lay the reflection of the blue inverted roof,\r\nfretted with its silver stars, like a second deeper sea, clasping and\r\nupholding the first. The fairy bath was probably fed from the fountain\r\nin the court. Led by an irresistible desire, I undressed, and plunged\r\ninto the water. It clothed me as with a new sense and its object both\r\nin one. The waters lay so close to me, they seemed to enter and revive\r\nmy heart. I rose to the surface, shook the water from my hair, and swam\r\nas in a rainbow, amid the coruscations of the gems below seen through\r\nthe agitation caused by my motion. Then, with open eyes, I dived, and\r\nswam beneath the surface. And here was a new wonder. For the basin,\r\nthus beheld, appeared to extend on all sides like a sea, with here and\r\nthere groups as of ocean rocks, hollowed by ceaseless billows into\r\nwondrous caves and grotesque pinnacles. Around the caves grew sea-weeds\r\nof all hues, and the corals glowed between; while far off, I saw the\r\nglimmer of what seemed to be creatures of human form at home in the\r\nwaters. I thought I had been enchanted; and that when I rose to the\r\nsurface, I should find myself miles from land, swimming alone upon a\r\nheaving sea; but when my eyes emerged from the waters, I saw above me\r\nthe blue spangled vault, and the red pillars around. I dived again, and\r\nfound myself once more in the heart of a great sea. I then arose, and\r\nswam to the edge, where I got out easily, for the water reached the\r\nvery brim, and, as I drew near washed in tiny waves over the black\r\nmarble border. I dressed, and went out, deeply refreshed.\r\n\r\nAnd now I began to discern faint, gracious forms, here and there\r\nthroughout the building. Some walked together in earnest conversation.\r\nOthers strayed alone. Some stood in groups, as if looking at and\r\ntalking about a picture or a statue. None of them heeded me. Nor were\r\nthey plainly visible to my eyes. Sometimes a group, or single\r\nindividual, would fade entirely out of the realm of my vision as I\r\ngazed. When evening came, and the moon arose, clear as a round of a\r\nhorizon-sea when the sun hangs over it in the west, I began to see them\r\nall more plainly; especially when they came between me and the moon;\r\nand yet more especially, when I myself was in the shade. But, even\r\nthen, I sometimes saw only the passing wave of a white robe; or a\r\nlovely arm or neck gleamed by in the moonshine; or white feet went\r\nwalking alone over the moony sward. Nor, I grieve to say, did I ever\r\ncome much nearer to these glorious beings, or ever look upon the Queen\r\nof the Fairies herself. My destiny ordered otherwise.\r\n\r\nIn this palace of marble and silver, and fountains and moonshine, I\r\nspent many days; waited upon constantly in my room with everything\r\ndesirable, and bathing daily in the fairy bath. All this time I was\r\nlittle troubled with my demon shadow I had a vague feeling that he was\r\nsomewhere about the palace; but it seemed as if the hope that I should\r\nin this place be finally freed from his hated presence, had sufficed to\r\nbanish him for a time. How and where I found him, I shall soon have to\r\nrelate.\r\n\r\nThe third day after my arrival, I found the library of the palace; and\r\nhere, all the time I remained, I spent most of the middle of the day.\r\nFor it was, not to mention far greater attractions, a luxurious retreat\r\nfrom the noontide sun. During the mornings and afternoons, I wandered\r\nabout the lovely neighbourhood, or lay, lost in delicious day-dreams,\r\nbeneath some mighty tree on the open lawn. My evenings were by-and-by\r\nspent in a part of the palace, the account of which, and of my\r\nadventures in connection with it, I must yet postpone for a little.\r\n\r\nThe library was a mighty hall, lighted from the roof, which was formed\r\nof something like glass, vaulted over in a single piece, and stained\r\nthroughout with a great mysterious picture in gorgeous colouring.\r\n\r\nThe walls were lined from floor to roof with books and books: most of\r\nthem in ancient bindings, but some in strange new fashions which I had\r\nnever seen, and which, were I to make the attempt, I could ill\r\ndescribe. All around the walls, in front of the books, ran galleries in\r\nrows, communicating by stairs. These galleries were built of all kinds\r\nof coloured stones; all sorts of marble and granite, with porphyry,\r\njasper, lapis lazuli, agate, and various others, were ranged in\r\nwonderful melody of successive colours. Although the material, then, of\r\nwhich these galleries and stairs were built, rendered necessary a\r\ncertain degree of massiveness in the construction, yet such was the\r\nsize of the place, that they seemed to run along the walls like cords.\r\n\r\nOver some parts of the library, descended curtains of silk of various\r\ndyes, none of which I ever saw lifted while I was there; and I felt\r\nsomehow that it would be presumptuous in me to venture to look within\r\nthem. But the use of the other books seemed free; and day after day I\r\ncame to the library, threw myself on one of the many sumptuous eastern\r\ncarpets, which lay here and there on the floor, and read, and read,\r\nuntil weary; if that can be designated as weariness, which was rather\r\nthe faintness of rapturous delight; or until, sometimes, the failing of\r\nthe light invited me to go abroad, in the hope that a cool gentle\r\nbreeze might have arisen to bathe, with an airy invigorating bath, the\r\nlimbs which the glow of the burning spirit within had withered no less\r\nthan the glow of the blazing sun without.\r\n\r\nOne peculiarity of these books, or at least most of those I looked\r\ninto, I must make a somewhat vain attempt to describe.\r\n\r\nIf, for instance, it was a book of metaphysics I opened, I had scarcely\r\nread two pages before I seemed to myself to be pondering over\r\ndiscovered truth, and constructing the intellectual machine whereby to\r\ncommunicate the discovery to my fellow men. With some books, however,\r\nof this nature, it seemed rather as if the process was removed yet a\r\ngreat way further back; and I was trying to find the root of a\r\nmanifestation, the spiritual truth whence a material vision sprang; or\r\nto combine two propositions, both apparently true, either at once or in\r\ndifferent remembered moods, and to find the point in which their\r\ninvisibly converging lines would unite in one, revealing a truth higher\r\nthan either and differing from both; though so far from being opposed\r\nto either, that it was that whence each derived its life and power. Or\r\nif the book was one of travels, I found myself the traveller. New\r\nlands, fresh experiences, novel customs, rose around me. I walked, I\r\ndiscovered, I fought, I suffered, I rejoiced in my success. Was it a\r\nhistory? I was the chief actor therein. I suffered my own blame; I was\r\nglad in my own praise. With a fiction it was the same. Mine was the\r\nwhole story. For I took the place of the character who was most like\r\nmyself, and his story was mine; until, grown weary with the life of\r\nyears condensed in an hour, or arrived at my deathbed, or the end of\r\nthe volume, I would awake, with a sudden bewilderment, to the\r\nconsciousness of my present life, recognising the walls and roof around\r\nme, and finding I joyed or sorrowed only in a book. If the book was a\r\npoem, the words disappeared, or took the subordinate position of an\r\naccompaniment to the succession of forms and images that rose and\r\nvanished with a soundless rhythm, and a hidden rime.\r\n\r\nIn one, with a mystical title, which I cannot recall, I read of a world\r\nthat is not like ours. The wondrous account, in such a feeble,\r\nfragmentary way as is possible to me, I would willingly impart. Whether\r\nor not it was all a poem, I cannot tell; but, from the impulse I felt,\r\nwhen I first contemplated writing it, to break into rime, to which\r\nimpulse I shall give way if it comes upon me again, I think it must\r\nhave been, partly at least, in verse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChained is the Spring. The night-wind bold\r\n    Blows over the hard earth;\r\nTime is not more confused and cold,\r\n    Nor keeps more wintry mirth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet blow, and roll the world about;\r\n    Blow, Time\xe2\x80\x94blow, winter\xe2\x80\x99s Wind!\r\nThrough chinks of Time, heaven peepeth out,\r\n    And Spring the frost behind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n          G. E. M.\r\n\r\n\r\nThey who believe in the influences of the stars over the fates of men,\r\nare, in feeling at least, nearer the truth than they who regard the\r\nheavenly bodies as related to them merely by a common obedience to an\r\nexternal law. All that man sees has to do with man. Worlds cannot be\r\nwithout an intermundane relationship. The community of the centre of\r\nall creation suggests an interradiating connection and dependence of\r\nthe parts. Else a grander idea is conceivable than that which is\r\nalready imbodied. The blank, which is only a forgotten life, lying\r\nbehind the consciousness, and the misty splendour, which is an\r\nundeveloped life, lying before it, may be full of mysterious\r\nrevelations of other connexions with the worlds around us, than those\r\nof science and poetry. No shining belt or gleaming moon, no red and\r\ngreen glory in a self-encircling twin-star, but has a relation with the\r\nhidden things of a man\xe2\x80\x99s soul, and, it may be, with the secret history\r\nof his body as well. They are portions of the living house wherein he\r\nabides.\r\n\r\nThrough the realms of the monarch Sun\r\nCreeps a world, whose course had begun,\r\nOn a weary path with a weary pace,\r\nBefore the Earth sprang forth on her race:\r\nBut many a time the Earth had sped\r\nAround the path she still must tread,\r\nEre the elder planet, on leaden wing,\r\nOnce circled the court of the planet\xe2\x80\x99s king.\r\n\r\nThere, in that lonely and distant star,\r\nThe seasons are not as our seasons are;\r\nBut many a year hath Autumn to dress\r\nThe trees in their matron loveliness;\r\nAs long hath old Winter in triumph to go\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99er beauties dead in his vaults below;\r\nAnd many a year the Spring doth wear\r\nCombing the icicles from her hair;\r\nAnd Summer, dear Summer, hath years of June,\r\nWith large white clouds, and cool showers at noon:\r\nAnd a beauty that grows to a weight like grief,\r\nTill a burst of tears is the heart\xe2\x80\x99s relief.\r\n\r\nChildren, born when Winter is king,\r\nMay never rejoice in the hoping Spring;\r\nThough their own heart-buds are bursting with joy,\r\nAnd the child hath grown to the girl or boy;\r\nBut may die with cold and icy hours\r\nWatching them ever in place of flowers.\r\nAnd some who awake from their primal sleep,\r\nWhen the sighs of Summer through forests creep,\r\nLive, and love, and are loved again;\r\nSeek for pleasure, and find its pain;\r\nSink to their last, their forsaken sleeping,\r\nWith the same sweet odours around them creeping.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow the children, there, are not born as the children are born in\r\nworlds nearer to the sun. For they arrive no one knows how. A maiden,\r\nwalking alone, hears a cry: for even there a cry is the first\r\nutterance; and searching about, she findeth, under an overhanging rock,\r\nor within a clump of bushes, or, it may be, betwixt gray stones on the\r\nside of a hill, or in any other sheltered and unexpected spot, a little\r\nchild. This she taketh tenderly, and beareth home with joy, calling\r\nout, \xe2\x80\x9cMother, mother\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94if so be that her mother lives\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI have got a\r\nbaby\xe2\x80\x94I have found a child!\xe2\x80\x9d All the household gathers round to\r\nsee;\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c_Where is it? What is it like? Where did you find it?_\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nsuch-like questions, abounding. And thereupon she relates the whole\r\nstory of the discovery; for by the circumstances, such as season of the\r\nyear, time of the day, condition of the air, and such like, and,\r\nespecially, the peculiar and never-repeated aspect of the heavens and\r\nearth at the time, and the nature of the place of shelter wherein it is\r\nfound, is determined, or at least indicated, the nature of the child\r\nthus discovered. Therefore, at certain seasons, and in certain states\r\nof the weather, according, in part, to their own fancy, the young women\r\ngo out to look for children. They generally avoid seeking them, though\r\nthey cannot help sometimes finding them, in places and with\r\ncircumstances uncongenial to their peculiar likings. But no sooner is a\r\nchild found, than its claim for protection and nurture obliterates all\r\nfeeling of choice in the matter. Chiefly, however, in the season of\r\nsummer, which lasts so long, coming as it does after such long\r\nintervals; and mostly in the warm evenings, about the middle of\r\ntwilight; and principally in the woods and along the river banks, do\r\nthe maidens go looking for children just as children look for flowers.\r\nAnd ever as the child grows, yea, more and more as he advances in\r\nyears, will his face indicate to those who understand the spirit of\r\nNature, and her utterances in the face of the world, the nature of the\r\nplace of his birth, and the other circumstances thereof; whether a\r\nclear morning sun guided his mother to the nook whence issued the boy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlow cry; or at eve the lonely maiden (for the same woman never finds a\r\nsecond, at least while the first lives) discovers the girl by the\r\nglimmer of her white skin, lying in a nest like that of the lark, amid\r\nlong encircling grasses, and the upward-gazing eyes of the lowly\r\ndaisies; whether the storm bowed the forest trees around, or the still\r\nfrost fixed in silence the else flowing and babbling stream.\r\n\r\nAfter they grow up, the men and women are but little together. There is\r\nthis peculiar difference between them, which likewise distinguishes the\r\nwomen from those of the earth. The men alone have arms; the women have\r\nonly wings. Resplendent wings are they, wherein they can shroud\r\nthemselves from head to foot in a panoply of glistering glory. By these\r\nwings alone, it may frequently be judged in what seasons, and under\r\nwhat aspects, they were born. From those that came in winter, go great\r\nwhite wings, white as snow; the edge of every feather shining like the\r\nsheen of silver, so that they flash and glitter like frost in the sun.\r\nBut underneath, they are tinged with a faint pink or rose-colour. Those\r\nborn in spring have wings of a brilliant green, green as grass; and\r\ntowards the edges the feathers are enamelled like the surface of the\r\ngrass-blades. These again are white within. Those that are born in\r\nsummer have wings of a deep rose-colour, lined with pale gold. And\r\nthose born in autumn have purple wings, with a rich brown on the\r\ninside. But these colours are modified and altered in all varieties,\r\ncorresponding to the mood of the day and hour, as well as the season of\r\nthe year; and sometimes I found the various colours so intermingled,\r\nthat I could not determine even the season, though doubtless the\r\nhieroglyphic could be deciphered by more experienced eyes. One\r\nsplendour, in particular, I remember\xe2\x80\x94wings of deep carmine, with an\r\ninner down of warm gray, around a form of brilliant whiteness.\r\n\r\nShe had been found as the sun went down through a low sea-fog, casting\r\ncrimson along a broad sea-path into a little cave on the shore, where a\r\nbathing maiden saw her lying.\r\n\r\nBut though I speak of sun and fog, and sea and shore, the world there\r\nis in some respects very different from the earth whereon men live. For\r\ninstance, the waters reflect no forms. To the unaccustomed eye they\r\nappear, if undisturbed, like the surface of a dark metal, only that the\r\nlatter would reflect indistinctly, whereas they reflect not at all,\r\nexcept light which falls immediately upon them. This has a great effect\r\nin causing the landscapes to differ from those on the earth. On the\r\nstillest evening, no tall ship on the sea sends a long wavering\r\nreflection almost to the feet of him on shore; the face of no maiden\r\nbrightens at its own beauty in a still forest-well. The sun and moon\r\nalone make a glitter on the surface. The sea is like a sea of death,\r\nready to ingulf and never to reveal: a visible shadow of oblivion. Yet\r\nthe women sport in its waters like gorgeous sea-birds. The men more\r\nrarely enter them. But, on the contrary, the sky reflects everything\r\nbeneath it, as if it were built of water like ours. Of course, from its\r\nconcavity there is some distortion of the reflected objects; yet\r\nwondrous combinations of form are often to be seen in the overhanging\r\ndepth. And then it is not shaped so much like a round dome as the sky\r\nof the earth, but, more of an egg-shape, rises to a great towering\r\nheight in the middle, appearing far more lofty than the other. When the\r\nstars come out at night, it shows a mighty cupola, \xe2\x80\x9cfretted with golden\r\nfires,\xe2\x80\x9d wherein there is room for all tempests to rush and rave.\r\n\r\nOne evening in early summer, I stood with a group of men and women on a\r\nsteep rock that overhung the sea. They were all questioning me about my\r\nworld and the ways thereof. In making reply to one of their questions,\r\nI was compelled to say that children are not born in the Earth as with\r\nthem. Upon this I was assailed with a whole battery of inquiries, which\r\nat first I tried to avoid; but, at last, I was compelled, in the\r\nvaguest manner I could invent, to make some approach to the subject in\r\nquestion. Immediately a dim notion of what I meant, seemed to dawn in\r\nthe minds of most of the women. Some of them folded their great wings\r\nall around them, as they generally do when in the least offended, and\r\nstood erect and motionless. One spread out her rosy pinions, and\r\nflashed from the promontory into the gulf at its foot. A great light\r\nshone in the eyes of one maiden, who turned and walked slowly away,\r\nwith her purple and white wings half dispread behind her. She was\r\nfound, the next morning, dead beneath a withered tree on a bare\r\nhill-side, some miles inland. They buried her where she lay, as is\r\ntheir custom; for, before they die, they instinctively search for a\r\nspot like the place of their birth, and having found one that satisfies\r\nthem, they lie down, fold their wings around them, if they be women, or\r\ncross their arms over their breasts, if they are men, just as if they\r\nwere going to sleep; and so sleep indeed. The sign or cause of coming\r\ndeath is an indescribable longing for something, they know not what,\r\nwhich seizes them, and drives them into solitude, consuming them\r\nwithin, till the body fails. When a youth and a maiden look too deep\r\ninto each other\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, this longing seizes and possesses them; but\r\ninstead of drawing nearer to each other, they wander away, each alone,\r\ninto solitary places, and die of their desire. But it seems to me, that\r\nthereafter they are born babes upon our earth: where, if, when grown,\r\nthey find each other, it goes well with them; if not, it will seem to\r\ngo ill. But of this I know nothing. When I told them that the women on\r\nthe Earth had not wings like them, but arms, they stared, and said how\r\nbold and masculine they must look; not knowing that their wings,\r\nglorious as they are, are but undeveloped arms.\r\n\r\nBut see the power of this book, that, while recounting what I can\r\nrecall of its contents, I write as if myself had visited the far-off\r\nplanet, learned its ways and appearances, and conversed with its men\r\nand women. And so, while writing, it seemed to me that I had.\r\n\r\nThe book goes on with the story of a maiden, who, born at the close of\r\nautumn, and living in a long, to her endless winter, set out at last to\r\nfind the regions of spring; for, as in our earth, the seasons are\r\ndivided over the globe. It begins something like this:\r\n\r\nShe watched them dying for many a day,\r\nDropping from off the old trees away,\r\nOne by one; or else in a shower\r\nCrowding over the withered flower\r\nFor as if they had done some grievous wrong,\r\nThe sun, that had nursed them and loved them so long,\r\nGrew weary of loving, and, turning back,\r\nHastened away on his southern track;\r\nAnd helplessly hung each shrivelled leaf,\r\nFaded away with an idle grief.\r\nAnd the gusts of wind, sad Autumn\xe2\x80\x99s sighs,\r\nMournfully swept through their families;\r\nCasting away with a helpless moan\r\nAll that he yet might call his own,\r\nAs the child, when his bird is gone for ever,\r\nFlingeth the cage on the wandering river.\r\nAnd the giant trees, as bare as Death,\r\nSlowly bowed to the great Wind\xe2\x80\x99s breath;\r\nAnd groaned with trying to keep from groaning\r\nAmidst the young trees bending and moaning.\r\nAnd the ancient planet\xe2\x80\x99s mighty sea\r\nWas heaving and falling most restlessly,\r\nAnd the tops of the waves were broken and white,\r\nTossing about to ease their might;\r\nAnd the river was striving to reach the main,\r\nAnd the ripple was hurrying back again.\r\nNature lived in sadness now;\r\nSadness lived on the maiden\xe2\x80\x99s brow,\r\nAs she watched, with a fixed, half-conscious eye,\r\nOne lonely leaf that trembled on high,\r\nTill it dropped at last from the desolate bough\xe2\x80\x94\r\nSorrow, oh, sorrow! \xe2\x80\x98tis winter now.\r\nAnd her tears gushed forth, though it was but a leaf,\r\nFor little will loose the swollen fountain of grief:\r\nWhen up to the lip the water goes,\r\nIt needs but a drop, and it overflows.\r\n\r\nOh! many and many a dreary year\r\nMust pass away ere the buds appear:\r\nMany a night of darksome sorrow\r\nYield to the light of a joyless morrow,\r\nEre birds again, on the clothed trees,\r\nShall fill the branches with melodies.\r\nShe will dream of meadows with wakeful streams;\r\nOf wavy grass in the sunny beams;\r\nOf hidden wells that soundless spring,\r\nHoarding their joy as a holy thing;\r\nOf founts that tell it all day long\r\nTo the listening woods, with exultant song;\r\nShe will dream of evenings that die into nights,\r\nWhere each sense is filled with its own delights,\r\nAnd the soul is still as the vaulted sky,\r\nLulled with an inner harmony;\r\n\r\nAnd the flowers give out to the dewy night,\r\nChanged into perfume, the gathered light;\r\nAnd the darkness sinks upon all their host,\r\nTill the sun sail up on the eastern coast\xe2\x80\x94\r\nShe will wake and see the branches bare,\r\nWeaving a net in the frozen air.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe story goes on to tell how, at last, weary with wintriness, she\r\ntravelled towards the southern regions of her globe, to meet the spring\r\non its slow way northwards; and how, after many sad adventures, many\r\ndisappointed hopes, and many tears, bitter and fruitless, she found at\r\nlast, one stormy afternoon, in a leafless forest, a single snowdrop\r\ngrowing betwixt the borders of the winter and spring. She lay down\r\nbeside it and died. I almost believe that a child, pale and peaceful as\r\na snowdrop, was born in the Earth within a fixed season from that\r\nstormy afternoon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw a ship sailing upon the sea\r\nDeeply laden as ship could be;\r\nBut not so deep as in love I am\r\nFor I care not whether I sink or swim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n          OLD BALLAD.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Love is such a Mystery\r\n    I cannot find it out:\r\nFor when I think I\xe2\x80\x99m best resolv\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\n    I then am in most doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n          SIR JOHN SUCKLING.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne story I will try to reproduce. But, alas! it is like trying to\r\nreconstruct a forest out of broken branches and withered leaves. In the\r\nfairy book, everything was just as it should be, though whether in\r\nwords or something else, I cannot tell. It glowed and flashed the\r\nthoughts upon the soul, with such a power that the medium disappeared\r\nfrom the consciousness, and it was occupied only with the things\r\nthemselves. My representation of it must resemble a translation from a\r\nrich and powerful language, capable of embodying the thoughts of a\r\nsplendidly developed people, into the meagre and half-articulate speech\r\nof a savage tribe. Of course, while I read it, I was Cosmo, and his\r\nhistory was mine. Yet, all the time, I seemed to have a kind of double\r\nconsciousness, and the story a double meaning. Sometimes it seemed only\r\nto represent a simple story of ordinary life, perhaps almost of\r\nuniversal life; wherein two souls, loving each other and longing to\r\ncome nearer, do, after all, but behold each other as in a glass darkly.\r\n\r\nAs through the hard rock go the branching silver veins; as into the\r\nsolid land run the creeks and gulfs from the unresting sea; as the\r\nlights and influences of the upper worlds sink silently through the\r\nearth\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere; so doth Faerie invade the world of men, and\r\nsometimes startle the common eye with an association as of cause and\r\neffect, when between the two no connecting links can be traced.\r\n\r\nCosmo von Wehrstahl was a student at the University of Prague. Though\r\nof a noble family, he was poor, and prided himself upon the\r\nindependence that poverty gives; for what will not a man pride himself\r\nupon, when he cannot get rid of it? A favourite with his fellow\r\nstudents, he yet had no companions; and none of them had ever crossed\r\nthe threshold of his lodging in the top of one of the highest houses in\r\nthe old town. Indeed, the secret of much of that complaisance which\r\nrecommended him to his fellows, was the thought of his unknown retreat,\r\nwhither in the evening he could betake himself and indulge undisturbed\r\nin his own studies and reveries. These studies, besides those subjects\r\nnecessary to his course at the University, embraced some less commonly\r\nknown and approved; for in a secret drawer lay the works of Albertus\r\nMagnus and Cornelius Agrippa, along with others less read and more\r\nabstruse. As yet, however, he had followed these researches only from\r\ncuriosity, and had turned them to no practical purpose.\r\n\r\nHis lodging consisted of one large low-ceiled room, singularly bare of\r\nfurniture; for besides a couple of wooden chairs, a couch which served\r\nfor dreaming on both by day and night, and a great press of black oak,\r\nthere was very little in the room that could be called furniture.\r\n\r\nBut curious instruments were heaped in the corners; and in one stood a\r\nskeleton, half-leaning against the wall, half-supported by a string\r\nabout its neck. One of its hands, all of fingers, rested on the heavy\r\npommel of a great sword that stood beside it.\r\n\r\nVarious weapons were scattered about over the floor. The walls were\r\nutterly bare of adornment; for the few strange things, such as a large\r\ndried bat with wings dispread, the skin of a porcupine, and a stuffed\r\nsea-mouse, could hardly be reckoned as such. But although his fancy\r\ndelighted in vagaries like these, he indulged his imagination with far\r\ndifferent fare. His mind had never yet been filled with an absorbing\r\npassion; but it lay like a still twilight open to any wind, whether the\r\nlow breath that wafts but odours, or the storm that bows the great\r\ntrees till they strain and creak. He saw everything as through a\r\nrose-coloured glass. When he looked from his window on the street\r\nbelow, not a maiden passed but she moved as in a story, and drew his\r\nthoughts after her till she disappeared in the vista. When he walked in\r\nthe streets, he always felt as if reading a tale, into which he sought\r\nto weave every face of interest that went by; and every sweet voice\r\nswept his soul as with the wing of a passing angel. He was in fact a\r\npoet without words; the more absorbed and endangered, that the\r\nspringing-waters were dammed back into his soul, where, finding no\r\nutterance, they grew, and swelled, and undermined. He used to lie on\r\nhis hard couch, and read a tale or a poem, till the book dropped from\r\nhis hand; but he dreamed on, he knew not whether awake or asleep, until\r\nthe opposite roof grew upon his sense, and turned golden in the\r\nsunrise. Then he arose too; and the impulses of vigorous youth kept him\r\never active, either in study or in sport, until again the close of the\r\nday left him free; and the world of night, which had lain drowned in\r\nthe cataract of the day, rose up in his soul, with all its stars, and\r\ndim-seen phantom shapes. But this could hardly last long. Some one form\r\nmust sooner or later step within the charmed circle, enter the house of\r\nlife, and compel the bewildered magician to kneel and worship.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon, towards dusk, he was wandering dreamily in one of the\r\nprincipal streets, when a fellow student roused him by a slap on the\r\nshoulder, and asked him to accompany him into a little back alley to\r\nlook at some old armour which he had taken a fancy to possess. Cosmo\r\nwas considered an authority in every matter pertaining to arms, ancient\r\nor modern. In the use of weapons, none of the students could come near\r\nhim; and his practical acquaintance with some had principally\r\ncontributed to establish his authority in reference to all. He\r\naccompanied him willingly.\r\n\r\nThey entered a narrow alley, and thence a dirty little court, where a\r\nlow arched door admitted them into a heterogeneous assemblage of\r\neverything musty, and dusty, and old, that could well be imagined. His\r\nverdict on the armour was satisfactory, and his companion at once\r\nconcluded the purchase. As they were leaving the place, Cosmo\xe2\x80\x99s eye was\r\nattracted by an old mirror of an elliptical shape, which leaned against\r\nthe wall, covered with dust. Around it was some curious carving, which\r\nhe could see but very indistinctly by the glimmering light which the\r\nowner of the shop carried in his hand. It was this carving that\r\nattracted his attention; at least so it appeared to him. He left the\r\nplace, however, with his friend, taking no further notice of it. They\r\nwalked together to the main street, where they parted and took opposite\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\nNo sooner was Cosmo left alone, than the thought of the curious old\r\nmirror returned to him. A strong desire to see it more plainly arose\r\nwithin him, and he directed his steps once more towards the shop. The\r\nowner opened the door when he knocked, as if he had expected him. He\r\nwas a little, old, withered man, with a hooked nose, and burning eyes\r\nconstantly in a slow restless motion, and looking here and there as if\r\nafter something that eluded them. Pretending to examine several other\r\narticles, Cosmo at last approached the mirror, and requested to have it\r\ntaken down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake it down yourself, master; I cannot reach it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man.\r\n\r\nCosmo took it down carefully, when he saw that the carving was indeed\r\ndelicate and costly, being both of admirable design and execution;\r\ncontaining withal many devices which seemed to embody some meaning to\r\nwhich he had no clue. This, naturally, in one of his tastes and\r\ntemperament, increased the interest he felt in the old mirror; so much,\r\nindeed, that he now longed to possess it, in order to study its frame\r\nat his leisure. He pretended, however, to want it only for use; and\r\nsaying he feared the plate could be of little service, as it was rather\r\nold, he brushed away a little of the dust from its face, expecting to\r\nsee a dull reflection within. His surprise was great when he found the\r\nreflection brilliant, revealing a glass not only uninjured by age, but\r\nwondrously clear and perfect (should the whole correspond to this part)\r\neven for one newly from the hands of the maker. He asked carelessly\r\nwhat the owner wanted for the thing. The old man replied by mentioning\r\na sum of money far beyond the reach of poor Cosmo, who proceeded to\r\nreplace the mirror where it had stood before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think the price too high?\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not know that it is too much for you to ask,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Cosmo; \xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\nit is far too much for me to give.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old man held up his light towards Cosmo\xe2\x80\x99s face. \xe2\x80\x9cI like your look,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid he.\r\n\r\nCosmo could not return the compliment. In fact, now he looked closely\r\nat him for the first time, he felt a kind of repugnance to him, mingled\r\nwith a strange feeling of doubt whether a man or a woman stood before\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is your name?\xe2\x80\x9d he continued.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCosmo von Wehrstahl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, ah! I thought as much. I see your father in you. I knew your\r\nfather very well, young sir. I dare say in some odd corners of my\r\nhouse, you might find some old things with his crest and cipher upon\r\nthem still. Well, I like you: you shall have the mirror at the fourth\r\npart of what I asked for it; but upon one condition.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is that?\xe2\x80\x9d said Cosmo; for, although the price was still a great\r\ndeal for him to give, he could just manage it; and the desire to\r\npossess the mirror had increased to an altogether unaccountable degree,\r\nsince it had seemed beyond his reach.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat if you should ever want to get rid of it again, you will let me\r\nhave the first offer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Cosmo, with a smile; adding, \xe2\x80\x9ca moderate condition\r\nindeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn your honour?\xe2\x80\x9d insisted the seller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn my honour,\xe2\x80\x9d said the buyer; and the bargain was concluded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will carry it home for you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man, as Cosmo took it in\r\nhis hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no; I will carry it myself,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; for he had a peculiar\r\ndislike to revealing his residence to any one, and more especially to\r\nthis person, to whom he felt every moment a greater antipathy. \xe2\x80\x9cJust as\r\nyou please,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old creature, and muttered to himself as he held\r\nhis light at the door to show him out of the court: \xe2\x80\x9cSold for the sixth\r\ntime! I wonder what will be the upshot of it this time. I should think\r\nmy lady had enough of it by now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCosmo carried his prize carefully home. But all the way he had an\r\nuncomfortable feeling that he was watched and dogged. Repeatedly he\r\nlooked about, but saw nothing to justify his suspicions. Indeed, the\r\nstreets were too crowded and too ill lighted to expose very readily a\r\ncareful spy, if such there should be at his heels. He reached his\r\nlodging in safety, and leaned his purchase against the wall, rather\r\nrelieved, strong as he was, to be rid of its weight; then, lighting his\r\npipe, threw himself on the couch, and was soon lapt in the folds of one\r\nof his haunting dreams.\r\n\r\nHe returned home earlier than usual the next day, and fixed the mirror\r\nto the wall, over the hearth, at one end of his long room.\r\n\r\nHe then carefully wiped away the dust from its face, and, clear as the\r\nwater of a sunny spring, the mirror shone out from beneath the envious\r\ncovering. But his interest was chiefly occupied with the curious\r\ncarving of the frame. This he cleaned as well as he could with a brush;\r\nand then he proceeded to a minute examination of its various parts, in\r\nthe hope of discovering some index to the intention of the carver. In\r\nthis, however, he was unsuccessful; and, at length, pausing with some\r\nweariness and disappointment, he gazed vacantly for a few moments into\r\nthe depth of the reflected room. But ere long he said, half aloud:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a strange thing a mirror is! and what a wondrous affinity exists\r\nbetween it and a man\xe2\x80\x99s imagination! For this room of mine, as I behold\r\nit in the glass, is the same, and yet not the same. It is not the mere\r\nrepresentation of the room I live in, but it looks just as if I were\r\nreading about it in a story I like. All its commonness has disappeared.\r\nThe mirror has lifted it out of the region of fact into the realm of\r\nart; and the very representing of it to me has clothed with interest\r\nthat which was otherwise hard and bare; just as one sees with delight\r\nupon the stage the representation of a character from which one would\r\nescape in life as from something unendurably wearisome. But is it not\r\nrather that art rescues nature from the weary and sated regards of our\r\nsenses, and the degrading injustice of our anxious everyday life, and,\r\nappealing to the imagination, which dwells apart, reveals Nature in\r\nsome degree as she really is, and as she represents herself to the eye\r\nof the child, whose every-day life, fearless and unambitious, meets the\r\ntrue import of the wonder-teeming world around him, and rejoices\r\ntherein without questioning? That skeleton, now\xe2\x80\x94I almost fear it,\r\nstanding there so still, with eyes only for the unseen, like a\r\nwatch-tower looking across all the waste of this busy world into the\r\nquiet regions of rest beyond. And yet I know every bone and every joint\r\nin it as well as my own fist. And that old battle-axe looks as if any\r\nmoment it might be caught up by a mailed hand, and, borne forth by the\r\nmighty arm, go crashing through casque, and skull, and brain, invading\r\nthe Unknown with yet another bewildered ghost. I should like to live in\r\n_that_ room if I could only get into it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nScarcely had the half-moulded words floated from him, as he stood\r\ngazing into the mirror, when, striking him as with a flash of amazement\r\nthat fixed him in his posture, noiseless and unannounced, glided\r\nsuddenly through the door into the reflected room, with stately motion,\r\nyet reluctant and faltering step, the graceful form of a woman, clothed\r\nall in white. Her back only was visible as she walked slowly up to the\r\ncouch in the further end of the room, on which she laid herself\r\nwearily, turning towards him a face of unutterable loveliness, in which\r\nsuffering, and dislike, and a sense of compulsion, strangely mingled\r\nwith the beauty. He stood without the power of motion for some moments,\r\nwith his eyes irrecoverably fixed upon her; and even after he was\r\nconscious of the ability to move, he could not summon up courage to\r\nturn and look on her, face to face, in the veritable chamber in which\r\nhe stood. At length, with a sudden effort, in which the exercise of the\r\nwill was so pure, that it seemed involuntary, he turned his face to the\r\ncouch. It was vacant. In bewilderment, mingled with terror, he turned\r\nagain to the mirror: there, on the reflected couch, lay the exquisite\r\nlady-form. She lay with closed eyes, whence two large tears were just\r\nwelling from beneath the veiling lids; still as death, save for the\r\nconvulsive motion of her bosom.\r\n\r\nCosmo himself could not have described what he felt. His emotions were\r\nof a kind that destroyed consciousness, and could never be clearly\r\nrecalled. He could not help standing yet by the mirror, and keeping his\r\neyes fixed on the lady, though he was painfully aware of his rudeness,\r\nand feared every moment that she would open hers, and meet his fixed\r\nregard. But he was, ere long, a little relieved; for, after a while,\r\nher eyelids slowly rose, and her eyes remained uncovered, but\r\nunemployed for a time; and when, at length, they began to wander about\r\nthe room, as if languidly seeking to make some acquaintance with her\r\nenvironment, they were never directed towards him: it seemed nothing\r\nbut what was in the mirror could affect her vision; and, therefore, if\r\nshe saw him at all, it could only be his back, which, of necessity, was\r\nturned towards her in the glass. The two figures in the mirror could\r\nnot meet face to face, except he turned and looked at her, present in\r\nhis room; and, as she was not there, he concluded that if he were to\r\nturn towards the part in his room corresponding to that in which she\r\nlay, his reflection would either be invisible to her altogether, or at\r\nleast it must appear to her to gaze vacantly towards her, and no\r\nmeeting of the eyes would produce the impression of spiritual\r\nproximity. By-and-by her eyes fell upon the skeleton, and he saw her\r\nshudder and close them. She did not open them again, but signs of\r\nrepugnance continued evident on her countenance. Cosmo would have\r\nremoved the obnoxious thing at once, but he feared to discompose her\r\nyet more by the assertion of his presence which the act would involve.\r\nSo he stood and watched her. The eyelids yet shrouded the eyes, as a\r\ncostly case the jewels within; the troubled expression gradually faded\r\nfrom the countenance, leaving only a faint sorrow behind; the features\r\nsettled into an unchanging expression of rest; and by these signs, and\r\nthe slow regular motion of her breathing, Cosmo knew that she slept. He\r\ncould now gaze on her without embarrassment. He saw that her figure,\r\ndressed in the simplest robe of white, was worthy of her face; and so\r\nharmonious, that either the delicately moulded foot, or any finger of\r\nthe equally delicate hand, was an index to the whole. As she lay, her\r\nwhole form manifested the relaxation of perfect repose. He gazed till\r\nhe was weary, and at last seated himself near the new-found shrine, and\r\nmechanically took up a book, like one who watches by a sick-bed. But\r\nhis eyes gathered no thoughts from the page before him. His intellect\r\nhad been stunned by the bold contradiction, to its face, of all its\r\nexperience, and now lay passive, without assertion, or speculation, or\r\neven conscious astonishment; while his imagination sent one wild dream\r\nof blessedness after another coursing through his soul. How long he sat\r\nhe knew not; but at length he roused himself, rose, and, trembling in\r\nevery portion of his frame, looked again into the mirror. She was gone.\r\nThe mirror reflected faithfully what his room presented, and nothing\r\nmore. It stood there like a golden setting whence the central jewel has\r\nbeen stolen away\xe2\x80\x94like a night-sky without the glory of its stars. She\r\nhad carried with her all the strangeness of the reflected room. It had\r\nsunk to the level of the one without.\r\n\r\nBut when the first pangs of his disappointment had passed, Cosmo began\r\nto comfort himself with the hope that she might return, perhaps the\r\nnext evening, at the same hour. Resolving that if she did, she should\r\nnot at least be scared by the hateful skeleton, he removed that and\r\nseveral other articles of questionable appearance into a recess by the\r\nside of the hearth, whence they could not possibly cast any reflection\r\ninto the mirror; and having made his poor room as tidy as he could,\r\nsought the solace of the open sky and of a night wind that had begun to\r\nblow, for he could not rest where he was. When he returned, somewhat\r\ncomposed, he could hardly prevail with himself to lie down on his bed;\r\nfor he could not help feeling as if she had lain upon it; and for him\r\nto lie there now would be something like sacrilege. However, weariness\r\nprevailed; and laying himself on the couch, dressed as he was, he slept\r\ntill day.\r\n\r\nWith a beating heart, beating till he could hardly breathe, he stood in\r\ndumb hope before the mirror, on the following evening. Again the\r\nreflected room shone as through a purple vapour in the gathering\r\ntwilight. Everything seemed waiting like himself for a coming splendour\r\nto glorify its poor earthliness with the presence of a heavenly joy.\r\nAnd just as the room vibrated with the strokes of the neighbouring\r\nchurch bell, announcing the hour of six, in glided the pale beauty, and\r\nagain laid herself on the couch. Poor Cosmo nearly lost his senses with\r\ndelight. She was there once more! Her eyes sought the corner where the\r\nskeleton had stood, and a faint gleam of satisfaction crossed her face,\r\napparently at seeing it empty. She looked suffering still, but there\r\nwas less of discomfort expressed in her countenance than there had been\r\nthe night before. She took more notice of the things about her, and\r\nseemed to gaze with some curiosity on the strange apparatus standing\r\nhere and there in her room. At length, however, drowsiness seemed to\r\novertake her, and again she fell asleep. Resolved not to lose sight of\r\nher this time, Cosmo watched the sleeping form. Her slumber was so deep\r\nand absorbing that a fascinating repose seemed to pass contagiously\r\nfrom her to him as he gazed upon her; and he started as if from a\r\ndream, when the lady moved, and, without opening her eyes, rose, and\r\npassed from the room with the gait of a somnambulist.\r\n\r\nCosmo was now in a state of extravagant delight. Most men have a secret\r\ntreasure somewhere. The miser has his golden hoard; the virtuoso his\r\npet ring; the student his rare book; the poet his favourite haunt; the\r\nlover his secret drawer; but Cosmo had a mirror with a lovely lady in\r\nit. And now that he knew by the skeleton, that she was affected by the\r\nthings around her, he had a new object in life: he would turn the bare\r\nchamber in the mirror into a room such as no lady need disdain to call\r\nher own. This he could effect only by furnishing and adorning his. And\r\nCosmo was poor. Yet he possessed accomplishments that could be turned\r\nto account; although, hitherto, he had preferred living on his slender\r\nallowance, to increasing his means by what his pride considered\r\nunworthy of his rank. He was the best swordsman in the University; and\r\nnow he offered to give lessons in fencing and similar exercises, to\r\nsuch as chose to pay him well for the trouble. His proposal was heard\r\nwith surprise by the students; but it was eagerly accepted by many; and\r\nsoon his instructions were not confined to the richer students, but\r\nwere anxiously sought by many of the young nobility of Prague and its\r\nneighbourhood. So that very soon he had a good deal of money at his\r\ncommand. The first thing he did was to remove his apparatus and\r\noddities into a closet in the room. Then he placed his bed and a few\r\nother necessaries on each side of the hearth, and parted them from the\r\nrest of the room by two screens of Indian fabric. Then he put an\r\nelegant couch for the lady to lie upon, in the corner where his bed had\r\nformerly stood; and, by degrees, every day adding some article of\r\nluxury, converted it, at length, into a rich boudoir.\r\n\r\nEvery night, about the same time, the lady entered. The first time she\r\nsaw the new couch, she started with a half-smile; then her face grew\r\nvery sad, the tears came to her eyes, and she laid herself upon the\r\ncouch, and pressed her face into the silken cushions, as if to hide\r\nfrom everything. She took notice of each addition and each change as\r\nthe work proceeded; and a look of acknowledgment, as if she knew that\r\nsome one was ministering to her, and was grateful for it, mingled with\r\nthe constant look of suffering. At length, after she had lain down as\r\nusual one evening, her eyes fell upon some paintings with which Cosmo\r\nhad just finished adorning the walls. She rose, and to his great\r\ndelight, walked across the room, and proceeded to examine them\r\ncarefully, testifying much pleasure in her looks as she did so. But\r\nagain the sorrowful, tearful expression returned, and again she buried\r\nher face in the pillows of her couch. Gradually, however, her\r\ncountenance had grown more composed; much of the suffering manifest on\r\nher first appearance had vanished, and a kind of quiet, hopeful\r\nexpression had taken its place; which, however, frequently gave way to\r\nan anxious, troubled look, mingled with something of sympathetic pity.\r\n\r\nMeantime, how fared Cosmo? As might be expected in one of his\r\ntemperament, his interest had blossomed into love, and his love\xe2\x80\x94shall I\r\ncall it _ripened_, or\xe2\x80\x94_withered_ into passion. But, alas! he loved a\r\nshadow. He could not come near her, could not speak to her, could not\r\nhear a sound from those sweet lips, to which his longing eyes would\r\ncling like bees to their honey-founts. Ever and anon he sang to\r\nhimself:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall die for love of the maiden;\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nand ever he looked again, and died not, though his heart seemed ready\r\nto break with intensity of life and longing. And the more he did for\r\nher, the more he loved her; and he hoped that, although she never\r\nappeared to see him, yet she was pleased to think that one unknown\r\nwould give his life to her. He tried to comfort himself over his\r\nseparation from her, by thinking that perhaps some day she would see\r\nhim and make signs to him, and that would satisfy him; \xe2\x80\x9cfor,\xe2\x80\x9d thought\r\nhe, \xe2\x80\x9cis not this all that a loving soul can do to enter into communion\r\nwith another? Nay, how many who love never come nearer than to behold\r\neach other as in a mirror; seem to know and yet never know the inward\r\nlife; never enter the other soul; and part at last, with but the\r\nvaguest notion of the universe on the borders of which they have been\r\nhovering for years? If I could but speak to her, and knew that she\r\nheard me, I should be satisfied.\xe2\x80\x9d Once he contemplated painting a\r\npicture on the wall, which should, of necessity, convey to the lady a\r\nthought of himself; but, though he had some skill with the pencil, he\r\nfound his hand tremble so much when he began the attempt, that he was\r\nforced to give it up. . . . . .\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho lives, he dies; who dies, he is alive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne evening, as he stood gazing on his treasure, he thought he saw a\r\nfaint expression of self-consciousness on her countenance, as if she\r\nsurmised that passionate eyes were fixed upon her. This grew; till at\r\nlast the red blood rose over her neck, and cheek, and brow. Cosmo\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlonging to approach her became almost delirious. This night she was\r\ndressed in an evening costume, resplendent with diamonds. This could\r\nadd nothing to her beauty, but it presented it in a new aspect; enabled\r\nher loveliness to make a new manifestation of itself in a new\r\nembodiment. For essential beauty is infinite; and, as the soul of\r\nNature needs an endless succession of varied forms to embody her\r\nloveliness, countless faces of beauty springing forth, not any two the\r\nsame, at any one of her heart-throbs; so the individual form needs an\r\ninfinite change of its environments, to enable it to uncover all the\r\nphases of its loveliness. Diamonds glittered from amidst her hair, half\r\nhidden in its luxuriance, like stars through dark rain-clouds; and the\r\nbracelets on her white arms flashed all the colours of a rainbow of\r\nlightnings, as she lifted her snowy hands to cover her burning face.\r\nBut her beauty shone down all its adornment. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I might have but one\r\nof her feet to kiss,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Cosmo, \xe2\x80\x9cI should be content.\xe2\x80\x9d Alas! he\r\ndeceived himself, for passion is never content. Nor did he know that\r\nthere are _two_ ways out of her enchanted house. But, suddenly, as if\r\nthe pang had been driven into his heart from without, revealing itself\r\nfirst in pain, and afterwards in definite form, the thought darted into\r\nhis mind, \xe2\x80\x9cShe has a lover somewhere. Remembered words of his bring the\r\ncolour on her face now. I am nowhere to her. She lives in another world\r\nall day, and all night, after she leaves me. Why does she come and make\r\nme love her, till I, a strong man, am too faint to look upon her more?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHe looked again, and her face was pale as a lily. A sorrowful\r\ncompassion seemed to rebuke the glitter of the restless jewels, and the\r\nslow tears rose in her eyes. She left her room sooner this evening than\r\nwas her wont. Cosmo remained alone, with a feeling as if his bosom had\r\nbeen suddenly left empty and hollow, and the weight of the whole world\r\nwas crushing in its walls. The next evening, for the first time since\r\nshe began to come, she came not.\r\n\r\nAnd now Cosmo was in wretched plight. Since the thought of a rival had\r\noccurred to him, he could not rest for a moment. More than ever he\r\nlonged to see the lady face to face. He persuaded himself that if he\r\nbut knew the worst he would be satisfied; for then he could abandon\r\nPrague, and find that relief in constant motion, which is the hope of\r\nall active minds when invaded by distress. Meantime he waited with\r\nunspeakable anxiety for the next night, hoping she would return: but\r\nshe did not appear. And now he fell really ill. Rallied by his fellow\r\nstudents on his wretched looks, he ceased to attend the lectures. His\r\nengagements were neglected. He cared for nothing. The sky, with the\r\ngreat sun in it, was to him a heartless, burning desert. The men and\r\nwomen in the streets were mere puppets, without motives in themselves,\r\nor interest to him. He saw them all as on the ever-changing field of a\r\n_camera obscura_. She\xe2\x80\x94she alone and altogether\xe2\x80\x94was his universe, his\r\nwell of life, his incarnate good. For six evenings she came not. Let\r\nhis absorbing passion, and the slow fever that was consuming his brain,\r\nbe his excuse for the resolution which he had taken and begun to\r\nexecute, before that time had expired.\r\n\r\nReasoning with himself, that it must be by some enchantment connected\r\nwith the mirror, that the form of the lady was to be seen in it, he\r\ndetermined to attempt to turn to account what he had hitherto studied\r\nprincipally from curiosity. \xe2\x80\x9cFor,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cif a spell can\r\nforce her presence in that glass (and she came unwillingly at first),\r\nmay not a stronger spell, such as I know, especially with the aid of\r\nher half-presence in the mirror, if ever she appears again, compel her\r\nliving form to come to me here? If I do her wrong, let love be my\r\nexcuse. I want only to know my doom from her own lips.\xe2\x80\x9d He never\r\ndoubted, all the time, that she was a real earthly woman; or, rather,\r\nthat there was a woman, who, somehow or other, threw this reflection of\r\nher form into the magic mirror.\r\n\r\nHe opened his secret drawer, took out his books of magic, lighted his\r\nlamp, and read and made notes from midnight till three in the morning,\r\nfor three successive nights. Then he replaced his books; and the next\r\nnight went out in quest of the materials necessary for the conjuration.\r\nThese were not easy to find; for, in love-charms and all incantations\r\nof this nature, ingredients are employed scarcely fit to be mentioned,\r\nand for the thought even of which, in connexion with her, he could only\r\nexcuse himself on the score of his bitter need. At length he succeeded\r\nin procuring all he required; and on the seventh evening from that on\r\nwhich she had last appeared, he found himself prepared for the exercise\r\nof unlawful and tyrannical power.\r\n\r\nHe cleared the centre of the room; stooped and drew a circle of red on\r\nthe floor, around the spot where he stood; wrote in the four quarters\r\nmystical signs, and numbers which were all powers of seven or nine;\r\nexamined the whole ring carefully, to see that no smallest break had\r\noccurred in the circumference; and then rose from his bending posture.\r\nAs he rose, the church clock struck seven; and, just as she had\r\nappeared the first time, reluctant, slow, and stately, glided in the\r\nlady. Cosmo trembled; and when, turning, she revealed a countenance\r\nworn and wan, as with sickness or inward trouble, he grew faint, and\r\nfelt as if he dared not proceed. But as he gazed on the face and form,\r\nwhich now possessed his whole soul, to the exclusion of all other joys\r\nand griefs, the longing to speak to her, to know that she heard him, to\r\nhear from her one word in return, became so unendurable, that he\r\nsuddenly and hastily resumed his preparations. Stepping carefully from\r\nthe circle, he put a small brazier into its centre. He then set fire to\r\nits contents of charcoal, and while it burned up, opened his window and\r\nseated himself, waiting, beside it.\r\n\r\nIt was a sultry evening. The air was full of thunder. A sense of\r\nluxurious depression filled the brain. The sky seemed to have grown\r\nheavy, and to compress the air beneath it. A kind of purplish tinge\r\npervaded the atmosphere, and through the open window came the scents of\r\nthe distant fields, which all the vapours of the city could not quench.\r\nSoon the charcoal glowed. Cosmo sprinkled upon it the incense and other\r\nsubstances which he had compounded, and, stepping within the circle,\r\nturned his face from the brazier and towards the mirror. Then, fixing\r\nhis eyes upon the face of the lady, he began with a trembling voice to\r\nrepeat a powerful incantation. He had not gone far, before the lady\r\ngrew pale; and then, like a returning wave, the blood washed all its\r\nbanks with its crimson tide, and she hid her face in her hands. Then he\r\npassed to a conjuration stronger yet.\r\n\r\nThe lady rose and walked uneasily to and fro in her room. Another\r\nspell; and she seemed seeking with her eyes for some object on which\r\nthey wished to rest. At length it seemed as if she suddenly espied him;\r\nfor her eyes fixed themselves full and wide upon his, and she drew\r\ngradually, and somewhat unwillingly, close to her side of the mirror,\r\njust as if his eyes had fascinated her. Cosmo had never seen her so\r\nnear before. Now at least, eyes met eyes; but he could not quite\r\nunderstand the expression of hers. They were full of tender entreaty,\r\nbut there was something more that he could not interpret. Though his\r\nheart seemed to labour in his throat, he would allow no delight or\r\nagitation to turn him from his task. Looking still in her face, he\r\npassed on to the mightiest charm he knew. Suddenly the lady turned and\r\nwalked out of the door of her reflected chamber. A moment after she\r\nentered his room with veritable presence; and, forgetting all his\r\nprecautions, he sprang from the charmed circle, and knelt before her.\r\nThere she stood, the living lady of his passionate visions, alone\r\nbeside him, in a thundery twilight, and the glow of a magic fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady, with a trembling voice, \xe2\x80\x9cdidst thou bring a poor\r\nmaiden through the rainy streets alone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I am dying for love of thee; but I only brought thee from the\r\nmirror there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, the mirror!\xe2\x80\x9d and she looked up at it, and shuddered. \xe2\x80\x9cAlas! I am\r\nbut a slave, while that mirror exists. But do not think it was the\r\npower of thy spells that drew me; it was thy longing desire to see me,\r\nthat beat at the door of my heart, till I was forced to yield.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCanst thou love me then?\xe2\x80\x9d said Cosmo, in a voice calm as death, but\r\nalmost inarticulate with emotion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not know,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied sadly; \xe2\x80\x9cthat I cannot tell, so long as I\r\nam bewildered with enchantments. It were indeed a joy too great, to lay\r\nmy head on thy bosom and weep to death; for I think thou lovest me,\r\nthough I do not know;\xe2\x80\x94but\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCosmo rose from his knees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI love thee as\xe2\x80\x94nay, I know not what\xe2\x80\x94for since I have loved thee, there\r\nis nothing else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe seized her hand: she withdrew it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, better not; I am in thy power, and therefore I may not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe burst into tears, and kneeling before him in her turn, said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCosmo, if thou lovest me, set me free, even from thyself; break the\r\nmirror.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd shall I see thyself instead?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I cannot tell, I will not deceive thee; we may never meet again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA fierce struggle arose in Cosmo\xe2\x80\x99s bosom. Now she was in his power. She\r\ndid not dislike him at least; and he could see her when he would. To\r\nbreak the mirror would be to destroy his very life, to banish out of\r\nhis universe the only glory it possessed. The whole world would be but\r\na prison, if he annihilated the one window that looked into the\r\nparadise of love. Not yet pure in love, he hesitated.\r\n\r\nWith a wail of sorrow the lady rose to her feet. \xe2\x80\x9cAh! he loves me not;\r\nhe loves me not even as I love him; and alas! I care more for his love\r\nthan even for the freedom I ask.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not wait to be willing,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Cosmo; and sprang to the corner\r\nwhere the great sword stood.\r\n\r\nMeantime it had grown very dark; only the embers cast a red glow\r\nthrough the room. He seized the sword by the steel scabbard, and stood\r\nbefore the mirror; but as he heaved a great blow at it with the heavy\r\npommel, the blade slipped half-way out of the scabbard, and the pommel\r\nstruck the wall above the mirror. At that moment, a terrible clap of\r\nthunder seemed to burst in the very room beside them; and ere Cosmo\r\ncould repeat the blow, he fell senseless on the hearth. When he came to\r\nhimself, he found that the lady and the mirror had both disappeared. He\r\nwas seized with a brain fever, which kept him to his couch for weeks.\r\n\r\nWhen he recovered his reason, he began to think what could have become\r\nof the mirror. For the lady, he hoped she had found her way back as she\r\ncame; but as the mirror involved her fate with its own, he was more\r\nimmediately anxious about that. He could not think she had carried it\r\naway. It was much too heavy, even if it had not been too firmly fixed\r\nin the wall, for her to remove it. Then again, he remembered the\r\nthunder; which made him believe that it was not the lightning, but some\r\nother blow that had struck him down. He concluded that, either by\r\nsupernatural agency, he having exposed himself to the vengeance of the\r\ndemons in leaving the circle of safety, or in some other mode, the\r\nmirror had probably found its way back to its former owner; and,\r\nhorrible to think of, might have been by this time once more disposed\r\nof, delivering up the lady into the power of another man; who, if he\r\nused his power no worse than he himself had done, might yet give Cosmo\r\nabundant cause to curse the selfish indecision which prevented him from\r\nshattering the mirror at once. Indeed, to think that she whom he loved,\r\nand who had prayed to him for freedom, should be still at the mercy, in\r\nsome degree, of the possessor of the mirror, and was at least exposed\r\nto his constant observation, was in itself enough to madden a chary\r\nlover.\r\n\r\nAnxiety to be well retarded his recovery; but at length he was able to\r\ncreep abroad. He first made his way to the old broker\xe2\x80\x99s, pretending to\r\nbe in search of something else. A laughing sneer on the creature\xe2\x80\x99s face\r\nconvinced him that he knew all about it; but he could not see it\r\namongst his furniture, or get any information out of him as to what had\r\nbecome of it. He expressed the utmost surprise at hearing it had been\r\nstolen, a surprise which Cosmo saw at once to be counterfeited; while,\r\nat the same time, he fancied that the old wretch was not at all anxious\r\nto have it mistaken for genuine. Full of distress, which he concealed\r\nas well as he could, he made many searches, but with no avail. Of\r\ncourse he could ask no questions; but he kept his ears awake for any\r\nremotest hint that might set him in a direction of search. He never\r\nwent out without a short heavy hammer of steel about him, that he might\r\nshatter the mirror the moment he was made happy by the sight of his\r\nlost treasure, if ever that blessed moment should arrive. Whether he\r\nshould see the lady again, was now a thought altogether secondary, and\r\npostponed to the achievement of her freedom. He wandered here and\r\nthere, like an anxious ghost, pale and haggard; gnawed ever at the\r\nheart, by the thought of what she might be suffering\xe2\x80\x94all from his\r\nfault.\r\n\r\nOne night, he mingled with a crowd that filled the rooms of one of the\r\nmost distinguished mansions in the city; for he accepted every\r\ninvitation, that he might lose no chance, however poor, of obtaining\r\nsome information that might expedite his discovery. Here he wandered\r\nabout, listening to every stray word that he could catch, in the hope\r\nof a revelation. As he approached some ladies who were talking quietly\r\nin a corner, one said to another:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you heard of the strange illness of the Princess von Hohenweiss?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; she has been ill for more than a year now. It is very sad for so\r\nfine a creature to have such a terrible malady. She was better for some\r\nweeks lately, but within the last few days the same attacks have\r\nreturned, apparently accompanied with more suffering than ever. It is\r\naltogether an inexplicable story.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there a story connected with her illness?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have only heard imperfect reports of it; but it is said that she\r\ngave offence some eighteen months ago to an old woman who had held an\r\noffice of trust in the family, and who, after some incoherent threats,\r\ndisappeared. This peculiar affection followed soon after. But the\r\nstrangest part of the story is its association with the loss of an\r\nantique mirror, which stood in her dressing-room, and of which she\r\nconstantly made use.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere the speaker\xe2\x80\x99s voice sank to a whisper; and Cosmo, although his\r\nvery soul sat listening in his ears, could hear no more. He trembled\r\ntoo much to dare to address the ladies, even if it had been advisable\r\nto expose himself to their curiosity. The name of the Princess was well\r\nknown to him, but he had never seen her; except indeed it was she,\r\nwhich now he hardly doubted, who had knelt before him on that dreadful\r\nnight. Fearful of attracting attention, for, from the weak state of his\r\nhealth, he could not recover an appearance of calmness, he made his way\r\nto the open air, and reached his lodgings; glad in this, that he at\r\nleast knew where she lived, although he never dreamed of approaching\r\nher openly, even if he should be happy enough to free her from her\r\nhateful bondage. He hoped, too, that as he had unexpectedly learned so\r\nmuch, the other and far more important part might be revealed to him\r\nere long.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you seen Steinwald lately?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I have not seen him for some time. He is almost a match for me at\r\nthe rapier, and I suppose he thinks he needs no more lessons.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder what has become of him. I want to see him very much. Let me\r\nsee; the last time I saw him he was coming out of that old broker\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nden, to which, if you remember, you accompanied me once, to look at\r\nsome armour. That is fully three weeks ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis hint was enough for Cosmo. Von Steinwald was a man of influence in\r\nthe court, well known for his reckless habits and fierce passions. The\r\nvery possibility that the mirror should be in his possession was hell\r\nitself to Cosmo. But violent or hasty measures of any sort were most\r\nunlikely to succeed. All that he wanted was an opportunity of breaking\r\nthe fatal glass; and to obtain this he must bide his time. He revolved\r\nmany plans in his mind, but without being able to fix upon any.\r\n\r\nAt length, one evening, as he was passing the house of Von Steinwald,\r\nhe saw the windows more than usually brilliant. He watched for a while,\r\nand seeing that company began to arrive, hastened home, and dressed as\r\nrichly as he could, in the hope of mingling with the guests\r\nunquestioned: in effecting which, there could be no difficulty for a\r\nman of his carriage.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a lofty, silent chamber, in another part of the city, lay a form\r\nmore like marble than a living woman. The loveliness of death seemed\r\nfrozen upon her face, for her lips were rigid, and her eyelids closed.\r\nHer long white hands were crossed over her breast, and no breathing\r\ndisturbed their repose. Beside the dead, men speak in whispers, as if\r\nthe deepest rest of all could be broken by the sound of a living voice.\r\nJust so, though the soul was evidently beyond the reach of all\r\nintimations from the senses, the two ladies, who sat beside her, spoke\r\nin the gentlest tones of subdued sorrow. \xe2\x80\x9cShe has lain so for an hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis cannot last long, I fear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much thinner she has grown within the last few weeks! If she would\r\nonly speak, and explain what she suffers, it would be better for her. I\r\nthink she has visions in her trances, but nothing can induce her to\r\nrefer to them when she is awake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes she ever speak in these trances?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have never heard her; but they say she walks sometimes, and once put\r\nthe whole household in a terrible fright by disappearing for a whole\r\nhour, and returning drenched with rain, and almost dead with exhaustion\r\nand fright. But even then she would give no account of what had\r\nhappened.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA scarce audible murmur from the yet motionless lips of the lady here\r\nstartled her attendants. After several ineffectual attempts at\r\narticulation, the word \xe2\x80\x9c_Cosmo!_\xe2\x80\x9d burst from her. Then she lay still as\r\nbefore; but only for a moment. With a wild cry, she sprang from the\r\ncouch erect on the floor, flung her arms above her head, with clasped\r\nand straining hands, and, her wide eyes flashing with light, called\r\naloud, with a voice exultant as that of a spirit bursting from a\r\nsepulchre, \xe2\x80\x9cI am free! I am free! I thank thee!\xe2\x80\x9d Then she flung herself\r\non the couch, and sobbed; then rose, and paced wildly up and down the\r\nroom, with gestures of mingled delight and anxiety. Then turning to her\r\nmotionless attendants\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cQuick, Lisa, my cloak and hood!\xe2\x80\x9d Then lower\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nmust go to him. Make haste, Lisa! You may come with me, if you will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn another moment they were in the street, hurrying along towards one\r\nof the bridges over the Moldau. The moon was near the zenith, and the\r\nstreets were almost empty. The Princess soon outstripped her attendant,\r\nand was half-way over the bridge, before the other reached it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you free, lady? The mirror is broken: are you free?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe words were spoken close beside her, as she hurried on. She turned;\r\nand there, leaning on the parapet in a recess of the bridge, stood\r\nCosmo, in a splendid dress, but with a white and quivering face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCosmo!\xe2\x80\x94I am free\xe2\x80\x94and thy servant for ever. I was coming to you now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I to you, for Death made me bold; but I could get no further. Have\r\nI atoned at all? Do I love you a little\xe2\x80\x94truly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, I know now that you love me, my Cosmo; but what do you say about\r\ndeath?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe did not reply. His hand was pressed against his side. She looked\r\nmore closely: the blood was welling from between the fingers. She flung\r\nher arms around him with a faint bitter wail.\r\n\r\nWhen Lisa came up, she found her mistress kneeling above a wan dead\r\nface, which smiled on in the spectral moonbeams.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now I will say no more about these wondrous volumes; though I could\r\ntell many a tale out of them, and could, perhaps, vaguely represent\r\nsome entrancing thoughts of a deeper kind which I found within them.\r\nFrom many a sultry noon till twilight, did I sit in that grand hall,\r\nburied and risen again in these old books. And I trust I have carried\r\naway in my soul some of the exhalations of their undying leaves. In\r\nafter hours of deserved or needful sorrow, portions of what I read\r\nthere have often come to me again, with an unexpected comforting; which\r\nwas not fruitless, even though the comfort might seem in itself\r\ngroundless and vain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour gallery\r\nHave we pass\xe2\x80\x99d through, not without much content\r\nIn many singularities; but we saw not\r\nThat which my daughter came to look upon,\r\nThe state of her mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n          _Winter\xe2\x80\x99s Tale_.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me strange, that all this time I had heard no music in the\r\nfairy palace. I was convinced there must be music in it, but that my\r\nsense was as yet too gross to receive the influence of those mysterious\r\nmotions that beget sound. Sometimes I felt sure, from the way the few\r\nfigures of which I got such transitory glimpses passed me, or glided\r\ninto vacancy before me, that they were moving to the law of music; and,\r\nin fact, several times I fancied for a moment that I heard a few\r\nwondrous tones coming I knew not whence. But they did not last long\r\nenough to convince me that I had heard them with the bodily sense. Such\r\nas they were, however, they took strange liberties with me, causing me\r\nto burst suddenly into tears, of which there was no presence to make me\r\nashamed, or casting me into a kind of trance of speechless delight,\r\nwhich, passing as suddenly, left me faint and longing for more.\r\n\r\nNow, on an evening, before I had been a week in the palace, I was\r\nwandering through one lighted arcade and corridor after another. At\r\nlength I arrived, through a door that closed behind me, in another vast\r\nhall of the palace. It was filled with a subdued crimson light; by\r\nwhich I saw that slender pillars of black, built close to walls of\r\nwhite marble, rose to a great height, and then, dividing into\r\ninnumerable divergent arches, supported a roof, like the walls, of\r\nwhite marble, upon which the arches intersected intricately, forming a\r\nfretting of black upon the white, like the network of a skeleton-leaf.\r\nThe floor was black.\r\n\r\nBetween several pairs of the pillars upon every side, the place of the\r\nwall behind was occupied by a crimson curtain of thick silk, hanging in\r\nheavy and rich folds. Behind each of these curtains burned a powerful\r\nlight, and these were the sources of the glow that filled the hall. A\r\npeculiar delicious odour pervaded the place. As soon as I entered, the\r\nold inspiration seemed to return to me, for I felt a strong impulse to\r\nsing; or rather, it seemed as if some one else was singing a song in my\r\nsoul, which wanted to come forth at my lips, imbodied in my breath. But\r\nI kept silence; and feeling somewhat overcome by the red light and the\r\nperfume, as well as by the emotion within me, and seeing at one end of\r\nthe hall a great crimson chair, more like a throne than a chair, beside\r\na table of white marble, I went to it, and, throwing myself in it, gave\r\nmyself up to a succession of images of bewildering beauty, which passed\r\nbefore my inward eye, in a long and occasionally crowded train. Here I\r\nsat for hours, I suppose; till, returning somewhat to myself, I saw\r\nthat the red light had paled away, and felt a cool gentle breath\r\ngliding over my forehead. I rose and left the hall with unsteady steps,\r\nfinding my way with some difficulty to my own chamber, and faintly\r\nremembering, as I went, that only in the marble cave, before I found\r\nthe sleeping statue, had I ever had a similar experience.\r\n\r\nAfter this, I repaired every morning to the same hall; where I\r\nsometimes sat in the chair and dreamed deliciously, and sometimes\r\nwalked up and down over the black floor. Sometimes I acted within\r\nmyself a whole drama, during one of these perambulations; sometimes\r\nwalked deliberately through the whole epic of a tale; sometimes\r\nventured to sing a song, though with a shrinking fear of I knew not\r\nwhat. I was astonished at the beauty of my own voice as it rang through\r\nthe place, or rather crept undulating, like a serpent of sound, along\r\nthe walls and roof of this superb music-hall. Entrancing verses arose\r\nwithin me as of their own accord, chanting themselves to their own\r\nmelodies, and requiring no addition of music to satisfy the inward\r\nsense. But, ever in the pauses of these, when the singing mood was upon\r\nme, I seemed to hear something like the distant sound of multitudes of\r\ndancers, and felt as if it was the unheard music, moving their rhythmic\r\nmotion, that within me blossomed in verse and song. I felt, too, that\r\ncould I but see the dance, I should, from the harmony of complicated\r\nmovements, not of the dancers in relation to each other merely, but of\r\neach dancer individually in the manifested plastic power that moved the\r\nconsenting harmonious form, understand the whole of the music on the\r\nbillows of which they floated and swung.\r\n\r\nAt length, one night, suddenly, when this feeling of dancing came upon\r\nme, I bethought me of lifting one of the crimson curtains, and looking\r\nif, perchance, behind it there might not be hid some other mystery,\r\nwhich might at least remove a step further the bewilderment of the\r\npresent one. Nor was I altogether disappointed. I walked to one of the\r\nmagnificent draperies, lifted a corner, and peeped in. There, burned a\r\ngreat, crimson, globe-shaped light, high in the cubical centre of\r\nanother hall, which might be larger or less than that in which I stood,\r\nfor its dimensions were not easily perceived, seeing that floor and\r\nroof and walls were entirely of black marble.\r\n\r\nThe roof was supported by the same arrangement of pillars radiating in\r\narches, as that of the first hall; only, here, the pillars and arches\r\nwere of dark red. But what absorbed my delighted gaze, was an\r\ninnumerable assembly of white marble statues, of every form, and in\r\nmultitudinous posture, filling the hall throughout. These stood, in the\r\nruddy glow of the great lamp, upon pedestals of jet black. Around the\r\nlamp shone in golden letters, plainly legible from where I stood, the\r\ntwo words\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nTOUCH NOT!\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was in all this, however, no solution to the sound of dancing;\r\nand now I was aware that the influence on my mind had ceased. I did not\r\ngo in that evening, for I was weary and faint, but I hoarded up the\r\nexpectation of entering, as of a great coming joy.\r\n\r\nNext night I walked, as on the preceding, through the hall. My mind was\r\nfilled with pictures and songs, and therewith so much absorbed, that I\r\ndid not for some time think of looking within the curtain I had last\r\nnight lifted. When the thought of doing so occurred to me first, I\r\nhappened to be within a few yards of it. I became conscious, at the\r\nsame moment, that the sound of dancing had been for some time in my\r\nears. I approached the curtain quickly, and, lifting it, entered the\r\nblack hall. Everything was still as death. I should have concluded that\r\nthe sound must have proceeded from some other more distant quarter,\r\nwhich conclusion its faintness would, in ordinary circumstances, have\r\nnecessitated from the first; but there was a something about the\r\nstatues that caused me still to remain in doubt. As I said, each stood\r\nperfectly still upon its black pedestal: but there was about every one\r\na certain air, not of motion, but as if it had just ceased from\r\nmovement; as if the rest were not altogether of the marbly stillness of\r\nthousands of years. It was as if the peculiar atmosphere of each had\r\nyet a kind of invisible tremulousness; as if its agitated wavelets had\r\nnot yet subsided into a perfect calm. I had the suspicion that they had\r\nanticipated my appearance, and had sprung, each, from the living joy of\r\nthe dance, to the death-silence and blackness of its isolated pedestal,\r\njust before I entered. I walked across the central hall to the curtain\r\nopposite the one I had lifted, and, entering there, found all the\r\nappearances similar; only that the statues were different, and\r\ndifferently grouped. Neither did they produce on my mind that\r\nimpression\xe2\x80\x94of motion just expired, which I had experienced from the\r\nothers. I found that behind every one of the crimson curtains was a\r\nsimilar hall, similarly lighted, and similarly occupied.\r\n\r\nThe next night, I did not allow my thoughts to be absorbed as before\r\nwith inward images, but crept stealthily along to the furthest curtain\r\nin the hall, from behind which, likewise, I had formerly seemed to hear\r\nthe sound of dancing. I drew aside its edge as suddenly as I could,\r\nand, looking in, saw that the utmost stillness pervaded the vast place.\r\nI walked in, and passed through it to the other end.\r\n\r\nThere I found that it communicated with a circular corridor, divided\r\nfrom it only by two rows of red columns. This corridor, which was\r\nblack, with red niches holding statues, ran entirely about the\r\nstatue-halls, forming a communication between the further ends of them\r\nall; further, that is, as regards the central hall of white whence they\r\nall diverged like radii, finding their circumference in the corridor.\r\n\r\nRound this corridor I now went, entering all the halls, of which there\r\nwere twelve, and finding them all similarly constructed, but filled\r\nwith quite various statues, of what seemed both ancient and modern\r\nsculpture. After I had simply walked through them, I found myself\r\nsufficiently tired to long for rest, and went to my own room.\r\n\r\nIn the night I dreamed that, walking close by one of the curtains, I\r\nwas suddenly seized with the desire to enter, and darted in. This time\r\nI was too quick for them. All the statues were in motion, statues no\r\nlonger, but men and women\xe2\x80\x94all shapes of beauty that ever sprang from\r\nthe brain of the sculptor, mingled in the convolutions of a complicated\r\ndance. Passing through them to the further end, I almost started from\r\nmy sleep on beholding, not taking part in the dance with the others,\r\nnor seemingly endued with life like them, but standing in marble\r\ncoldness and rigidity upon a black pedestal in the extreme left\r\ncorner\xe2\x80\x94my lady of the cave; the marble beauty who sprang from her tomb\r\nor her cradle at the call of my songs. While I gazed in speechless\r\nastonishment and admiration, a dark shadow, descending from above like\r\nthe curtain of a stage, gradually hid her entirely from my view. I felt\r\nwith a shudder that this shadow was perchance my missing demon, whom I\r\nhad not seen for days. I awoke with a stifled cry.\r\n\r\nOf course, the next evening I began my journey through the halls (for I\r\nknew not to which my dream had carried me), in the hope of proving the\r\ndream to be a true one, by discovering my marble beauty upon her black\r\npedestal. At length, on reaching the tenth hall, I thought I recognised\r\nsome of the forms I had seen dancing in my dream; and to my\r\nbewilderment, when I arrived at the extreme corner on the left, there\r\nstood, the only one I had yet seen, a vacant pedestal. It was exactly\r\nin the position occupied, in my dream, by the pedestal on which the\r\nwhite lady stood. Hope beat violently in my heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said I to myself, \xe2\x80\x9cif yet another part of the dream would but\r\ncome true, and I should succeed in surprising these forms in their\r\nnightly dance; it might be the rest would follow, and I should see on\r\nthe pedestal my marble queen. Then surely if my songs sufficed to give\r\nher life before, when she lay in the bonds of alabaster, much more\r\nwould they be sufficient then to give her volition and motion, when she\r\nalone of assembled crowds of marble forms, would be standing rigid and\r\ncold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the difficulty was, to surprise the dancers. I had found that a\r\npremeditated attempt at surprise, though executed with the utmost care\r\nand rapidity, was of no avail. And, in my dream, it was effected by a\r\nsudden thought suddenly executed. I saw, therefore, that there was no\r\nplan of operation offering any probability of success, but this: to\r\nallow my mind to be occupied with other thoughts, as I wandered around\r\nthe great centre-hall; and so wait till the impulse to enter one of the\r\nothers should happen to arise in me just at the moment when I was close\r\nto one of the crimson curtains. For I hoped that if I entered any one\r\nof the twelve halls at the right moment, that would as it were give me\r\nthe right of entrance to all the others, seeing they all had\r\ncommunication behind. I would not diminish the hope of the right\r\nchance, by supposing it necessary that a desire to enter should awake\r\nwithin me, precisely when I was close to the curtains of the tenth\r\nhall.\r\n\r\nAt first the impulses to see recurred so continually, in spite of the\r\ncrowded imagery that kept passing through my mind, that they formed too\r\nnearly a continuous chain, for the hope that any one of them would\r\nsucceed as a surprise. But as I persisted in banishing them, they\r\nrecurred less and less often; and after two or three, at considerable\r\nintervals, had come when the spot where I happened to be was\r\nunsuitable, the hope strengthened, that soon one might arise just at\r\nthe right moment; namely, when, in walking round the hall, I should be\r\nclose to one of the curtains.\r\n\r\nAt length the right moment and the impulse coincided. I darted into the\r\nninth hall. It was full of the most exquisite moving forms. The whole\r\nspace wavered and swam with the involutions of an intricate dance. It\r\nseemed to break suddenly as I entered, and all made one or two bounds\r\ntowards their pedestals; but, apparently on finding that they were\r\nthoroughly overtaken, they returned to their employment (for it seemed\r\nwith them earnest enough to be called such) without further heeding me.\r\nSomewhat impeded by the floating crowd, I made what haste I could\r\ntowards the bottom of the hall; whence, entering the corridor, I turned\r\ntowards the tenth. I soon arrived at the corner I wanted to reach, for\r\nthe corridor was comparatively empty; but, although the dancers here,\r\nafter a little confusion, altogether disregarded my presence, I was\r\ndismayed at beholding, even yet, a vacant pedestal. But I had a\r\nconviction that she was near me. And as I looked at the pedestal, I\r\nthought I saw upon it, vaguely revealed as if through overlapping folds\r\nof drapery, the indistinct outlines of white feet. Yet there was no\r\nsign of drapery or concealing shadow whatever. But I remembered the\r\ndescending shadow in my dream. And I hoped still in the power of my\r\nsongs; thinking that what could dispel alabaster, might likewise be\r\ncapable of dispelling what concealed my beauty now, even if it were the\r\ndemon whose darkness had overshadowed all my life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Alexander_. \xe2\x80\x98When will you finish Campaspe?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n_Apelles_. \xe2\x80\x98Never finish: for always in absolute beauty there is\r\nsomewhat above art.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n          LYLY\xe2\x80\x99S _Campaspe_.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now, what song should I sing to unveil my Isis, if indeed she was\r\npresent unseen? I hurried away to the white hall of Phantasy, heedless\r\nof the innumerable forms of beauty that crowded my way: these might\r\ncross my eyes, but the unseen filled my brain. I wandered long, up and\r\ndown the silent space: no songs came. My soul was not still enough for\r\nsongs. Only in the silence and darkness of the soul\xe2\x80\x99s night, do those\r\nstars of the inward firmament sink to its lower surface from the\r\nsinging realms beyond, and shine upon the conscious spirit. Here all\r\neffort was unavailing. If they came not, they could not be found.\r\n\r\nNext night, it was just the same. I walked through the red glimmer of\r\nthe silent hall; but lonely as there I walked, as lonely trod my soul\r\nup and down the halls of the brain. At last I entered one of the\r\nstatue-halls. The dance had just commenced, and I was delighted to find\r\nthat I was free of their assembly. I walked on till I came to the\r\nsacred corner. There I found the pedestal just as I had left it, with\r\nthe faint glimmer as of white feet still resting on the dead black. As\r\nsoon as I saw it, I seemed to feel a presence which longed to become\r\nvisible; and, as it were, called to me to gift it with\r\nself-manifestation, that it might shine on me. The power of song came\r\nto me. But the moment my voice, though I sang low and soft, stirred the\r\nair of the hall, the dancers started; the quick interweaving crowd\r\nshook, lost its form, divided; each figure sprang to its pedestal, and\r\nstood, a self-evolving life no more, but a rigid, life-like, marble\r\nshape, with the whole form composed into the expression of a single\r\nstate or act. Silence rolled like a spiritual thunder through the grand\r\nspace. My song had ceased, scared at its own influences. But I saw in\r\nthe hand of one of the statues close by me, a harp whose chords yet\r\nquivered. I remembered that as she bounded past me, her harp had\r\nbrushed against my arm; so the spell of the marble had not infolded it.\r\nI sprang to her, and with a gesture of entreaty, laid my hand on the\r\nharp. The marble hand, probably from its contact with the uncharmed\r\nharp, had strength enough to relax its hold, and yield the harp to me.\r\nNo other motion indicated life. Instinctively I struck the chords and\r\nsang. And not to break upon the record of my song, I mention here, that\r\nas I sang the first four lines, the loveliest feet became clear upon\r\nthe black pedestal; and ever as I sang, it was as if a veil were being\r\nlifted up from before the form, but an invisible veil, so that the\r\nstatue appeared to grow before me, not so much by evolution, as by\r\ninfinitesimal degrees of added height. And, while I sang, I did not\r\nfeel that I stood by a statue, as indeed it appeared to be, but that a\r\nreal woman-soul was revealing itself by successive stages of\r\nimbodiment, and consequent manifestatlon and expression.\r\n\r\nFeet of beauty, firmly planting\r\n    Arches white on rosy heel!\r\nWhence the life-spring, throbbing, panting,\r\n    Pulses upward to reveal!\r\nFairest things know least despising;\r\n    Foot and earth meet tenderly:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tis the woman, resting, rising\r\n    Upward to sublimity,\r\n\r\nRise the limbs, sedately sloping,\r\n    Strong and gentle, full and free;\r\nSoft and slow, like certain hoping,\r\n    Drawing nigh the broad firm knee.\r\nUp to speech! As up to roses\r\n    Pants the life from leaf to flower,\r\nSo each blending change discloses,\r\n    Nearer still, expression\xe2\x80\x99s power.\r\n\r\nLo! fair sweeps, white surges, twining\r\n    Up and outward fearlessly!\r\nTemple columns, close combining,\r\n    Lift a holy mystery.\r\nHeart of mine! what strange surprises\r\n    Mount aloft on such a stair!\r\nSome great vision upward rises,\r\n    Curving, bending, floating fair.\r\n\r\nBands and sweeps, and hill and hollow\r\n    Lead my fascinated eye;\r\nSome apocalypse will follow,\r\n    Some new world of deity.\r\nZoned unseen, and outward swelling,\r\n    With new thoughts and wonders rife,\r\nQueenly majesty foretelling,\r\n    See the expanding house of life!\r\n\r\nSudden heaving, unforbidden\r\n    Sighs eternal, still the same\xe2\x80\x94\r\nMounts of snow have summits hidden\r\n    In the mists of uttered flame.\r\nBut the spirit, dawning nearly\r\n    Finds no speech for earnest pain;\r\nFinds a soundless sighing merely\xe2\x80\x94\r\n    Builds its stairs, and mounts again.\r\n\r\nHeart, the queen, with secret hoping,\r\n    Sendeth out her waiting pair;\r\nHands, blind hands, half blindly groping,\r\n    Half inclasping visions rare;\r\nAnd the great arms, heartways bending;\r\n    Might of Beauty, drawing home\r\nThere returning, and re-blending,\r\n    Where from roots of love they roam.\r\n\r\nBuild thy slopes of radiance beamy\r\n    Spirit, fair with womanhood!\r\nTower thy precipice, white-gleamy,\r\n    Climb unto the hour of good.\r\nDumb space will be rent asunder,\r\n    Now the shining column stands\r\nReady to be crowned with wonder\r\n    By the builder\xe2\x80\x99s joyous hands.\r\n\r\nAll the lines abroad are spreading,\r\n    Like a fountain\xe2\x80\x99s falling race.\r\nLo, the chin, first feature, treading,\r\n    Airy foot to rest the face!\r\nSpeech is nigh; oh, see the blushing,\r\n    Sweet approach of lip and breath!\r\nRound the mouth dim silence, hushing,\r\n    Waits to die ecstatic death.\r\n\r\nSpan across in treble curving,\r\n    Bow of promise, upper lip!\r\nSet them free, with gracious swerving;\r\n    Let the wing-words float and dip.\r\n_Dumb art thou?_ O Love immortal,\r\n    More than words thy speech must be;\r\nChildless yet the tender portal\r\n    Of the home of melody.\r\n\r\nNow the nostrils open fearless,\r\n    Proud in calm unconsciousness,\r\nSure it must be something peerless\r\n    That the great Pan would express!\r\nDeepens, crowds some meaning tender,\r\n    In the pure, dear lady-face.\r\nLo, a blinding burst of splendour!\xe2\x80\x94\r\n    \xe2\x80\x99Tis the free soul\xe2\x80\x99s issuing grace.\r\n\r\nTwo calm lakes of molten glory\r\n    Circling round unfathomed deeps!\r\nLightning-flashes, transitory,\r\n    Cross the gulfs where darkness sleeps.\r\nThis the gate, at last, of gladness,\r\n    To the outward striving _me_:\r\nIn a rain of light and sadness,\r\n    Out its loves and longings flee!\r\n\r\nWith a presence I am smitten\r\n    Dumb, with a foreknown surprise;\r\nPresence greater yet than written\r\n    Even in the glorious eyes.\r\nThrough the gulfs, with inward gazes,\r\n    I may look till I am lost;\r\nWandering deep in spirit-mazes,\r\n    In a sea without a coast.\r\n\r\nWindows open to the glorious!\r\n    Time and space, oh, far beyond!\r\nWoman, ah! thou art victorious,\r\n    And I perish, overfond.\r\nSprings aloft the yet Unspoken\r\n    In the forehead\xe2\x80\x99s endless grace,\r\nFull of silences unbroken;\r\n    Infinite, unfeatured face.\r\n\r\nDomes above, the mount of wonder;\r\n    Height and hollow wrapt in night;\r\nHiding in its caverns under\r\n    Woman-nations in their might.\r\nPassing forms, the highest Human\r\n    Faints away to the Divine\r\nFeatures none, of man or woman,\r\n    Can unveil the holiest shine.\r\n\r\nSideways, grooved porches only\r\n    Visible to passing eye,\r\nStand the silent, doorless, lonely\r\n    Entrance-gates of melody.\r\nBut all sounds fly in as boldly,\r\n    Groan and song, and kiss and cry\r\nAt their galleries, lifted coldly,\r\n    Darkly, \xe2\x80\x98twixt the earth and sky.\r\n\r\nBeauty, thou art spent, thou knowest\r\n    So, in faint, half-glad despair,\r\nFrom the summit thou o\xe2\x80\x99erflowest\r\n    In a fall of torrent hair;\r\nHiding what thou hast created\r\n    In a half-transparent shroud:\r\nThus, with glory soft-abated,\r\n    Shines the moon through vapoury cloud.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEv\xe2\x80\x99n the Styx, which ninefold her infoldeth\r\n    Hems not Ceres\xe2\x80\x99 daughter in its flow;\r\nBut she grasps the apple\xe2\x80\x94ever holdeth\r\n    Her, sad Orcus, down below.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n          SCHILLER, _Das Ideal und das Leben_.\r\n\r\n\r\nEver as I sang, the veil was uplifted; ever as I sang, the signs of\r\nlife grew; till, when the eyes dawned upon me, it was with that sunrise\r\nof splendour which my feeble song attempted to re-imbody.\r\n\r\nThe wonder is, that I was not altogether overcome, but was able to\r\ncomplete my song as the unseen veil continued to rise. This ability\r\ncame solely from the state of mental elevation in which I found myself.\r\nOnly because uplifted in song, was I able to endure the blaze of the\r\ndawn. But I cannot tell whether she looked more of statue or more of\r\nwoman; she seemed removed into that region of phantasy where all is\r\nintensely vivid, but nothing clearly defined. At last, as I sang of her\r\ndescending hair, the glow of soul faded away, like a dying sunset. A\r\nlamp within had been extinguished, and the house of life shone blank in\r\na winter morn. She was a statue once more\xe2\x80\x94but visible, and that was\r\nmuch gained. Yet the revulsion from hope and fruition was such, that,\r\nunable to restrain myself, I sprang to her, and, in defiance of the law\r\nof the place, flung my arms around her, as if I would tear her from the\r\ngrasp of a visible Death, and lifted her from the pedestal down to my\r\nheart. But no sooner had her feet ceased to be in contact with the\r\nblack pedestal, than she shuddered and trembled all over; then,\r\nwrithing from my arms, before I could tighten their hold, she sprang\r\ninto the corridor, with the reproachful cry, \xe2\x80\x9cYou should not have\r\ntouched me!\xe2\x80\x9d darted behind one of the exterior pillars of the circle,\r\nand disappeared. I followed almost as fast; but ere I could reach the\r\npillar, the sound of a closing door, the saddest of all sounds\r\nsometimes, fell on my ear; and, arriving at the spot where she had\r\nvanished, I saw, lighted by a pale yellow lamp which hung above it, a\r\nheavy, rough door, altogether unlike any others I had seen in the\r\npalace; for they were all of ebony, or ivory, or covered with\r\nsilver-plates, or of some odorous wood, and very ornate; whereas this\r\nseemed of old oak, with heavy nails and iron studs. Notwithstanding the\r\nprecipitation of my pursuit, I could not help reading, in silver\r\nletters beneath the lamp: \xe2\x80\x9c_No one enters here without the leave of the\r\nQueen_.\xe2\x80\x9d But what was the Queen to me, when I followed my white lady? I\r\ndashed the door to the wall and sprang through. Lo! I stood on a waste\r\nwindy hill. Great stones like tombstones stood all about me. No door,\r\nno palace was to be seen. A white figure gleamed past me, wringing her\r\nhands, and crying, \xe2\x80\x9cAh! you should have sung to me; you should have\r\nsung to me!\xe2\x80\x9d and disappeared behind one of the stones. I followed. A\r\ncold gust of wind met me from behind the stone; and when I looked, I\r\nsaw nothing but a great hole in the earth, into which I could find no\r\nway of entering. Had she fallen in? I could not tell. I must wait for\r\nthe daylight. I sat down and wept, for there was no help.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFirst, I thought, almost despairing,\r\n    This must crush my spirit now;\r\nYet I bore it, and am bearing\xe2\x80\x94\r\n    Only do not ask me how.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n          HEINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the daylight came, it brought the possibility of action, but with\r\nit little of consolation. With the first visible increase of light, I\r\ngazed into the chasm, but could not, for more than an hour, see\r\nsufficiently well to discover its nature. At last I saw it was almost a\r\nperpendicular opening, like a roughly excavated well, only very large.\r\nI could perceive no bottom; and it was not till the sun actually rose,\r\nthat I discovered a sort of natural staircase, in many parts little\r\nmore than suggested, which led round and round the gulf, descending\r\nspirally into its abyss. I saw at once that this was my path; and\r\nwithout a moment\xe2\x80\x99s hesitation, glad to quit the sunlight, which stared\r\nat me most heartlessly, I commenced my tortuous descent. It was very\r\ndifficult. In some parts I had to cling to the rocks like a bat. In one\r\nplace, I dropped from the track down upon the next returning spire of\r\nthe stair; which being broad in this particular portion, and standing\r\nout from the wall at right angles, received me upon my feet safe,\r\nthough somewhat stupefied by the shock. After descending a great way, I\r\nfound the stair ended at a narrow opening which entered the rock\r\nhorizontally. Into this I crept, and, having entered, had just room to\r\nturn round. I put my head out into the shaft by which I had come down,\r\nand surveyed the course of my descent. Looking up, I saw the stars;\r\nalthough the sun must by this time have been high in the heavens.\r\nLooking below, I saw that the sides of the shaft went sheer down,\r\nsmooth as glass; and far beneath me, I saw the reflection of the same\r\nstars I had seen in the heavens when I looked up. I turned again, and\r\ncrept inwards some distance, when the passage widened, and I was at\r\nlength able to stand and walk upright. Wider and loftier grew the way;\r\nnew paths branched off on every side; great open halls appeared; till\r\nat last I found myself wandering on through an underground country, in\r\nwhich the sky was of rock, and instead of trees and flowers, there were\r\nonly fantastic rocks and stones. And ever as I went, darker grew my\r\nthoughts, till at last I had no hope whatever of finding the white\r\nlady: I no longer called her to myself _my_ white lady. Whenever a\r\nchoice was necessary, I always chose the path which seemed to lead\r\ndownwards.\r\n\r\nAt length I began to find that these regions were inhabited. From\r\nbehind a rock a peal of harsh grating laughter, full of evil humour,\r\nrang through my ears, and, looking round, I saw a queer, goblin\r\ncreature, with a great head and ridiculous features, just such as those\r\ndescribed, in German histories and travels, as Kobolds. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you\r\nwant with me?\xe2\x80\x9d I said. He pointed at me with a long forefinger, very\r\nthick at the root, and sharpened to a point, and answered, \xe2\x80\x9cHe! he! he!\r\nwhat do _you_ want here?\xe2\x80\x9d Then, changing his tone, he continued, with\r\nmock humility\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cHonoured sir, vouchsafe to withdraw from thy slaves the\r\nlustre of thy august presence, for thy slaves cannot support its\r\nbrightness.\xe2\x80\x9d A second appeared, and struck in: \xe2\x80\x9cYou are so big, you\r\nkeep the sun from us. We can\xe2\x80\x99t see for you, and we\xe2\x80\x99re so cold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThereupon arose, on all sides, the most terrific uproar of laughter,\r\nfrom voices like those of children in volume, but scrannel and harsh as\r\nthose of decrepit age, though, unfortunately, without its weakness. The\r\nwhole pandemonium of fairy devils, of all varieties of fantastic\r\nugliness, both in form and feature, and of all sizes from one to four\r\nfeet, seemed to have suddenly assembled about me. At length, after a\r\ngreat babble of talk among themselves, in a language unknown to me, and\r\nafter seemingly endless gesticulation, consultation, elbow-nudging, and\r\nunmitigated peals of laughter, they formed into a circle about one of\r\ntheir number, who scrambled upon a stone, and, much to my surprise, and\r\nsomewhat to my dismay, began to sing, in a voice corresponding in its\r\nnature to his talking one, from beginning to end, the song with which I\r\nhad brought the light into the eyes of the white lady. He sang the same\r\nair too; and, all the time, maintained a face of mock entreaty and\r\nworship; accompanying the song with the travestied gestures of one\r\nplaying on the lute. The whole assembly kept silence, except at the\r\nclose of every verse, when they roared, and danced, and shouted with\r\nlaughter, and flung themselves on the ground, in real or pretended\r\nconvulsions of delight. When he had finished, the singer threw himself\r\nfrom the top of the stone, turning heels over head several times in his\r\ndescent; and when he did alight, it was on the top of his head, on\r\nwhich he hopped about, making the most grotesque gesticulations with\r\nhis legs in the air. Inexpressible laughter followed, which broke up in\r\na shower of tiny stones from innumerable hands. They could not\r\nmaterially injure me, although they cut me on the head and face. I\r\nattempted to run away, but they all rushed upon me, and, laying hold of\r\nevery part that afforded a grasp, held me tight. Crowding about me like\r\nbees, they shouted an insect-swarm of exasperating speeches up into my\r\nface, among which the most frequently recurring were\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cYou shan\xe2\x80\x99t have\r\nher; you shan\xe2\x80\x99t have her; he! he! he! She\xe2\x80\x99s for a better man; how he\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nkiss her! how he\xe2\x80\x99ll kiss her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe galvanic torrent of this battery of malevolence stung to life\r\nwithin me a spark of nobleness, and I said aloud, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, if he is a\r\nbetter man, let him have her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey instantly let go their hold of me, and fell back a step or two,\r\nwith a whole broadside of grunts and humphs, as of unexpected and\r\ndisappointed approbation. I made a step or two forward, and a lane was\r\ninstantly opened for me through the midst of the grinning little\r\nantics, who bowed most politely to me on every side as I passed. After\r\nI had gone a few yards, I looked back, and saw them all standing quite\r\nstill, looking after me, like a great school of boys; till suddenly one\r\nturned round, and with a loud whoop, rushed into the midst of the\r\nothers. In an instant, the whole was one writhing and tumbling heap of\r\ncontortion, reminding me of the live pyramids of intertwined snakes of\r\nwhich travellers make report. As soon as one was worked out of the\r\nmass, he bounded off a few paces, and then, with a somersault and a\r\nrun, threw himself gyrating into the air, and descended with all his\r\nweight on the summit of the heaving and struggling chaos of fantastic\r\nfigures. I left them still busy at this fierce and apparently aimless\r\namusement. And as I went, I sang\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nIf a nobler waits for thee,\r\n    I will weep aside;\r\nIt is well that thou should\xe2\x80\x99st be,\r\n    Of the nobler, bride.\r\n\r\nFor if love builds up the home,\r\n    Where the heart is free,\r\nHomeless yet the heart must roam,\r\n    That has not found thee.\r\n\r\nOne must suffer: I, for her\r\n    Yield in her my part\r\nTake her, thou art worthier\xe2\x80\x94\r\n    Still I be still, my heart!\r\n\r\nGift ungotten! largess high\r\n    Of a frustrate will!\r\nBut to yield it lovingly\r\n    Is a something still.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen a little song arose of itself in my soul; and I felt for the\r\nmoment, while it sank sadly within me, as if I was once more walking up\r\nand down the white hall of Phantasy in the Fairy Palace. But this\r\nlasted no longer than the song; as will be seen.\r\n\r\nDo not vex thy violet\r\n    Perfume to afford:\r\nElse no odour thou wilt get\r\n    From its little hoard.\r\n\r\nIn thy lady\xe2\x80\x99s gracious eyes\r\n    Look not thou too long;\r\nElse from them the glory flies,\r\n    And thou dost her wrong.\r\n\r\nCome not thou too near the maid,\r\n    Clasp her not too wild;\r\nElse the splendour is allayed,\r\n    And thy heart beguiled.\r\n\r\n\r\nA crash of laughter, more discordant and deriding than any I had yet\r\nheard, invaded my ears. Looking on in the direction of the sound, I saw\r\na little elderly woman, much taller, however, than the goblins I had\r\njust left, seated upon a stone by the side of the path. She rose, as I\r\ndrew near, and came forward to meet me.\r\n\r\nShe was very plain and commonplace in appearance, without being\r\nhideously ugly. Looking up in my face with a stupid sneer, she said:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it a pity you haven\xe2\x80\x99t a pretty girl to walk all alone with you\r\nthrough this sweet country? How different everything would look?\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it? Strange that one can never have what one would like best!\r\nHow the roses would bloom and all that, even in this infernal hole!\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t they, Anodos? Her eyes would light up the old cave, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthey?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat depends on who the pretty girl should be,\xe2\x80\x9d replied I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot so very much matter that,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered; \xe2\x80\x9clook here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had turned to go away as I gave my reply, but now I stopped and\r\nlooked at her. As a rough unsightly bud might suddenly blossom into the\r\nmost lovely flower; or rather, as a sunbeam bursts through a shapeless\r\ncloud, and transfigures the earth; so burst a face of resplendent\r\nbeauty, as it were _through_ the unsightly visage of the woman,\r\ndestroying it with light as it dawned through it. A summer sky rose\r\nabove me, gray with heat; across a shining slumberous landscape, looked\r\nfrom afar the peaks of snow-capped mountains; and down from a great\r\nrock beside me fell a sheet of water mad with its own delight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStay with me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, lifting up her exquisite face, and looking\r\nfull in mine.\r\n\r\nI drew back. Again the infernal laugh grated upon my ears; again the\r\nrocks closed in around me, and the ugly woman looked at me with wicked,\r\nmocking hazel eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall have your reward,\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cYou shall see your white lady\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat lies not with you,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, and turned and left her.\r\n\r\nShe followed me with shriek upon shriek of laughter, as I went on my\r\nway.\r\n\r\nI may mention here, that although there was always light enough to see\r\nmy path and a few yards on every side of me, I never could find out the\r\nsource of this sad sepulchral illumination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the wind\xe2\x80\x99s uproar, the sea\xe2\x80\x99s raging grim,\r\nAnd the sighs that are born in him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n          HEINE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom dreams of bliss shall men awake\r\nOne day, but not to weep:\r\nThe dreams remain; they only break\r\nThe mirror of the sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n          JEAN PAUL, _Hesperus_.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow I got through this dreary part of my travels, I do not know. I do\r\nnot think I was upheld by the hope that any moment the light might\r\nbreak in upon me; for I scarcely thought about that. I went on with a\r\ndull endurance, varied by moments of uncontrollable sadness; for more\r\nand more the conviction grew upon me that I should never see the white\r\nlady again. It may seem strange that one with whom I had held so little\r\ncommunion should have so engrossed my thoughts; but benefits conferred\r\nawaken love in some minds, as surely as benefits received in others.\r\nBesides being delighted and proud that _my_ songs had called the\r\nbeautiful creature to life, the same fact caused me to feel a\r\ntenderness unspeakable for her, accompanied with a kind of feeling of\r\nproperty in her; for so the goblin Selfishness would reward the angel\r\nLove. When to all this is added, an overpowering sense of her beauty,\r\nand an unquestioning conviction that this was a true index to inward\r\nloveliness, it may be understood how it came to pass that my\r\nimagination filled my whole soul with the play of its own multitudinous\r\ncolours and harmonies around the form which yet stood, a gracious\r\nmarble radiance, in the midst of _its_ white hall of phantasy. The time\r\npassed by unheeded; for my thoughts were busy. Perhaps this was also in\r\npart the cause of my needing no food, and never thinking how I should\r\nfind any, during this subterraneous part of my travels. How long they\r\nendured I could not tell, for I had no means of measuring time; and\r\nwhen I looked back, there was such a discrepancy between the decisions\r\nof my imagination and my judgment, as to the length of time that had\r\npassed, that I was bewildered, and gave up all attempts to arrive at\r\nany conclusion on the point.\r\n\r\nA gray mist continually gathered behind me. When I looked back towards\r\nthe past, this mist was the medium through which my eyes had to strain\r\nfor a vision of what had gone by; and the form of the white lady had\r\nreceded into an unknown region. At length the country of rock began to\r\nclose again around me, gradually and slowly narrowing, till I found\r\nmyself walking in a gallery of rock once more, both sides of which I\r\ncould touch with my outstretched hands. It narrowed yet, until I was\r\nforced to move carefully, in order to avoid striking against the\r\nprojecting pieces of rock. The roof sank lower and lower, until I was\r\ncompelled, first to stoop, and then to creep on my hands and knees. It\r\nrecalled terrible dreams of childhood; but I was not much afraid,\r\nbecause I felt sure that this was my path, and my only hope of leaving\r\nFairy Land, of which I was now almost weary.\r\n\r\nAt length, on getting past an abrupt turn in the passage, through which\r\nI had to force myself, I saw, a few yards ahead of me, the\r\nlong-forgotten daylight shining through a small opening, to which the\r\npath, if path it could now be called, led me. With great difficulty I\r\naccomplished these last few yards, and came forth to the day. I stood\r\non the shore of a wintry sea, with a wintry sun just a few feet above\r\nits horizon-edge. It was bare, and waste, and gray. Hundreds of\r\nhopeless waves rushed constantly shorewards, falling exhausted upon a\r\nbeach of great loose stones, that seemed to stretch miles and miles in\r\nboth directions. There was nothing for the eye but mingling shades of\r\ngray; nothing for the ear but the rush of the coming, the roar of the\r\nbreaking, and the moan of the retreating wave. No rock lifted up a\r\nsheltering severity above the dreariness around; even that from which I\r\nhad myself emerged rose scarcely a foot above the opening by which I\r\nhad reached the dismal day, more dismal even than the tomb I had left.\r\nA cold, death-like wind swept across the shore, seeming to issue from a\r\npale mouth of cloud upon the horizon. Sign of life was nowhere visible.\r\nI wandered over the stones, up and down the beach, a human imbodiment\r\nof the nature around me. The wind increased; its keen waves flowed\r\nthrough my soul; the foam rushed higher up the stones; a few dead stars\r\nbegan to gleam in the east; the sound of the waves grew louder and yet\r\nmore despairing. A dark curtain of cloud was lifted up, and a pale blue\r\nrent shone between its foot and the edge of the sea, out from which\r\nrushed an icy storm of frozen wind, that tore the waters into spray as\r\nit passed, and flung the billows in raving heaps upon the desolate\r\nshore. I could bear it no longer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not be tortured to death,\xe2\x80\x9d I cried; \xe2\x80\x9cI will meet it half-way.\r\nThe life within me is yet enough to bear me up to the face of Death,\r\nand then I die unconquered.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore it had grown so dark, I had observed, though without any\r\nparticular interest, that on one part of the shore a low platform of\r\nrock seemed to run out far into the midst of the breaking waters.\r\n\r\nTowards this I now went, scrambling over smooth stones, to which scarce\r\neven a particle of sea-weed clung; and having found it, I got on it,\r\nand followed its direction, as near as I could guess, out into the\r\ntumbling chaos. I could hardly keep my feet against the wind and sea.\r\nThe waves repeatedly all but swept me off my path; but I kept on my\r\nway, till I reached the end of the low promontory, which, in the fall\r\nof the waves, rose a good many feet above the surface, and, in their\r\nrise, was covered with their waters. I stood one moment and gazed into\r\nthe heaving abyss beneath me; then plunged headlong into the mounting\r\nwave below. A blessing, like the kiss of a mother, seemed to alight on\r\nmy soul; a calm, deeper than that which accompanies a hope deferred,\r\nbathed my spirit. I sank far into the waters, and sought not to return.\r\nI felt as if once more the great arms of the beech-tree were around me,\r\nsoothing me after the miseries I had passed through, and telling me,\r\nlike a little sick child, that I should be better to-morrow. The waters\r\nof themselves lifted me, as with loving arms, to the surface. I\r\nbreathed again, but did not unclose my eyes. I would not look on the\r\nwintry sea, and the pitiless gray sky. Thus I floated, till something\r\ngently touched me. It was a little boat floating beside me. How it came\r\nthere I could not tell; but it rose and sank on the waters, and kept\r\ntouching me in its fall, as if with a human will to let me know that\r\nhelp was by me. It was a little gay-coloured boat, seemingly covered\r\nwith glistering scales like those of a fish, all of brilliant rainbow\r\nhues. I scrambled into it, and lay down in the bottom, with a sense of\r\nexquisite repose.\r\n\r\nThen I drew over me a rich, heavy, purple cloth that was beside me;\r\nand, lying still, knew, by the sound of the waters, that my little bark\r\nwas fleeting rapidly onwards. Finding, however, none of that stormy\r\nmotion which the sea had manifested when I beheld it from the shore, I\r\nopened my eyes; and, looking first up, saw above me the deep violet sky\r\nof a warm southern night; and then, lifting my head, saw that I was\r\nsailing fast upon a summer sea, in the last border of a southern\r\ntwilight. The aureole of the sun yet shot the extreme faint tips of its\r\nlongest rays above the horizon-waves, and withdrew them not. It was a\r\nperpetual twilight. The stars, great and earnest, like children\xe2\x80\x99s eyes,\r\nbent down lovingly towards the waters; and the reflected stars within\r\nseemed to float up, as if longing to meet their embraces. But when I\r\nlooked down, a new wonder met my view. For, vaguely revealed beneath\r\nthe wave, I floated above my whole Past. The fields of my childhood\r\nflitted by; the halls of my youthful labours; the streets of great\r\ncities where I had dwelt; and the assemblies of men and women wherein I\r\nhad wearied myself seeking for rest. But so indistinct were the\r\nvisions, that sometimes I thought I was sailing on a shallow sea, and\r\nthat strange rocks and forests of sea-plants beguiled my eye,\r\nsufficiently to be transformed, by the magic of the phantasy, into\r\nwell-known objects and regions. Yet, at times, a beloved form seemed to\r\nlie close beneath me in sleep; and the eyelids would tremble as if\r\nabout to forsake the conscious eye; and the arms would heave upwards,\r\nas if in dreams they sought for a satisfying presence. But these\r\nmotions might come only from the heaving of the waters between those\r\nforms and me. Soon I fell asleep, overcome with fatigue and delight. In\r\ndreams of unspeakable joy\xe2\x80\x94of restored friendships; of revived embraces;\r\nof love which said it had never died; of faces that had vanished long\r\nago, yet said with smiling lips that they knew nothing of the grave; of\r\npardons implored, and granted with such bursting floods of love, that I\r\nwas almost glad I had sinned\xe2\x80\x94thus I passed through this wondrous\r\ntwilight. I awoke with the feeling that I had been kissed and loved to\r\nmy heart\xe2\x80\x99s content; and found that my boat was floating motionless by\r\nthe grassy shore of a little island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn still rest, in changeless simplicity, I bear,\r\nuninterrupted, the consciousness of the whole of Humanity within me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n          SCHLEIERMACHER, _Monologen_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c... such a sweetness, such a grace,\r\n    In all thy speech appear,\r\nThat what to th\xe2\x80\x99eye a beauteous face,\r\n    That thy tongue is to the ear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n          COWLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe water was deep to the very edge; and I sprang from the little boat\r\nupon a soft grassy turf. The island seemed rich with a profusion of all\r\ngrasses and low flowers. All delicate lowly things were most plentiful;\r\nbut no trees rose skywards, not even a bush overtopped the tall\r\ngrasses, except in one place near the cottage I am about to describe,\r\nwhere a few plants of the gum-cistus, which drops every night all the\r\nblossoms that the day brings forth, formed a kind of natural arbour.\r\nThe whole island lay open to the sky and sea. It rose nowhere more than\r\na few feet above the level of the waters, which flowed deep all around\r\nits border. Here there seemed to be neither tide nor storm. A sense of\r\npersistent calm and fulness arose in the mind at the sight of the slow,\r\npulse-like rise and fall of the deep, clear, unrippled waters against\r\nthe bank of the island, for shore it could hardly be called, being so\r\nmuch more like the edge of a full, solemn river. As I walked over the\r\ngrass towards the cottage, which stood at a little distance from the\r\nbank, all the flowers of childhood looked at me with perfect child-eyes\r\nout of the grass. My heart, softened by the dreams through which it had\r\npassed, overflowed in a sad, tender love towards them. They looked to\r\nme like children impregnably fortified in a helpless confidence. The\r\nsun stood half-way down the western sky, shining very soft and golden;\r\nand there grew a second world of shadows amidst the world of grasses\r\nand wild flowers.\r\n\r\nThe cottage was square, with low walls, and a high pyramidal roof\r\nthatched with long reeds, of which the withered blossoms hung over all\r\nthe eaves. It is noticeable that most of the buildings I saw in Fairy\r\nLand were cottages. There was no path to a door, nor, indeed, was there\r\nany track worn by footsteps in the island.\r\n\r\nThe cottage rose right out of the smooth turf. It had no windows that I\r\ncould see; but there was a door in the centre of the side facing me, up\r\nto which I went. I knocked, and the sweetest voice I had ever heard\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cCome in.\xe2\x80\x9d I entered. A bright fire was burning on a hearth in\r\nthe centre of the earthern floor, and the smoke found its way out at an\r\nopening in the centre of the pyramidal roof. Over the fire hung a\r\nlittle pot, and over the pot bent a woman-face, the most wonderful, I\r\nthought, that I had ever beheld. For it was older than any countenance\r\nI had ever looked upon. There was not a spot in which a wrinkle could\r\nlie, where a wrinkle lay not. And the skin was ancient and brown, like\r\nold parchment. The woman\xe2\x80\x99s form was tall and spare: and when she stood\r\nup to welcome me, I saw that she was straight as an arrow. Could that\r\nvoice of sweetness have issued from those lips of age? Mild as they\r\nwere, could they be the portals whence flowed such melody? But the\r\nmoment I saw her eyes, I no longer wondered at her voice: they were\r\nabsolutely young\xe2\x80\x94those of a woman of five-and-twenty, large, and of a\r\nclear gray. Wrinkles had beset them all about; the eyelids themselves\r\nwere old, and heavy, and worn; but the eyes were very incarnations of\r\nsoft light. She held out her hand to me, and the voice of sweetness\r\nagain greeted me, with the single word, \xe2\x80\x9cWelcome.\xe2\x80\x9d She set an old\r\nwooden chair for me, near the fire, and went on with her cooking. A\r\nwondrous sense of refuge and repose came upon me. I felt like a boy who\r\nhas got home from school, miles across the hills, through a heavy storm\r\nof wind and snow. Almost, as I gazed on her, I sprang from my seat to\r\nkiss those old lips. And when, having finished her cooking, she brought\r\nsome of the dish she had prepared, and set it on a little table by me,\r\ncovered with a snow-white cloth, I could not help laying my head on her\r\nbosom, and bursting into happy tears. She put her arms round me,\r\nsaying, \xe2\x80\x9cPoor child; poor child!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs I continued to weep, she gently disengaged herself, and, taking a\r\nspoon, put some of the food (I did not know what it was) to my lips,\r\nentreating me most endearingly to swallow it. To please her, I made an\r\neffort, and succeeded. She went on feeding me like a baby, with one arm\r\nround me, till I looked up in her face and smiled: then she gave me the\r\nspoon and told me to eat, for it would do me good. I obeyed her, and\r\nfound myself wonderfully refreshed. Then she drew near the fire an\r\nold-fashioned couch that was in the cottage, and making me lie down\r\nupon it, sat at my feet, and began to sing. Amazing store of old\r\nballads rippled from her lips, over the pebbles of ancient tunes; and\r\nthe voice that sang was sweet as the voice of a tuneful maiden that\r\nsingeth ever from very fulness of song. The songs were almost all sad,\r\nbut with a sound of comfort. One I can faintly recall. It was something\r\nlike this:\r\n\r\nSir Aglovaile through the churchyard rode;\r\n        _Sing, All alone I lie:_\r\nLittle recked he where\xe2\x80\x99er he yode,\r\n        _All alone, up in the sky_.\r\n\r\nSwerved his courser, and plunged with fear\r\n        _All alone I lie:_\r\nHis cry might have wakened the dead men near,\r\n        _All alone, up in the sky_.\r\n\r\nThe very dead that lay at his feet,\r\nLapt in the mouldy winding-sheet.\r\n\r\nBut he curbed him and spurred him, until he stood\r\nStill in his place, like a horse of wood,\r\n\r\nWith nostrils uplift, and eyes wide and wan;\r\nBut the sweat in streams from his fetlocks ran.\r\n\r\nA ghost grew out of the shadowy air,\r\nAnd sat in the midst of her moony hair.\r\n\r\nIn her gleamy hair she sat and wept;\r\nIn the dreamful moon they lay and slept;\r\n\r\nThe shadows above, and the bodies below,\r\nLay and slept in the moonbeams slow.\r\n\r\nAnd she sang, like the moan of an autumn wind\r\nOver the stubble left behind:\r\n\r\n_Alas, how easily things go wrong!\r\nA sigh too much, or a kiss too long,\r\nAnd there follows a mist and a weeping rain,\r\nAnd life is never the same again.\r\n\r\nAlas, how hardly things go right!\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tis hard to watch on a summer night,\r\nFor the sigh will come and the kiss will stay,\r\nAnd the summer night is a winter day._\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, lovely ghosts my heart is woes\r\nTo see thee weeping and wailing so.\r\n\r\nOh, lovely ghost,\xe2\x80\x9d said the fearless knight,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan the sword of a warrior set it right?\r\n\r\nOr prayer of bedesman, praying mild,\r\nAs a cup of water a feverish child,\r\n\r\nSooth thee at last, in dreamless mood\r\nTo sleep the sleep a dead lady should?\r\n\r\nThine eyes they fill me with longing sore,\r\nAs if I had known thee for evermore.\r\n\r\nOh, lovely ghost, I could leave the day\r\nTo sit with thee in the moon away\r\n\r\nIf thou wouldst trust me, and lay thy head\r\nTo rest on a bosom that is not dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThe lady sprang up with a strange ghost-cry,\r\nAnd she flung her white ghost-arms on high:\r\n\r\nAnd she laughed a laugh that was not gay,\r\nAnd it lengthened out till it died away;\r\n\r\nAnd the dead beneath turned and moaned,\r\nAnd the yew-trees above they shuddered and groaned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill he love me twice with a love that is vain?\r\nWill he kill the poor ghost yet again?\r\n\r\nI thought thou wert good; but I said, and wept:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Can I have dreamed who have not slept?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd I knew, alas! or ever I would,\r\nWhether I dreamed, or thou wert good.\r\n\r\nWhen my baby died, my brain grew wild.\r\nI awoke, and found I was with my child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf thou art the ghost of my Adelaide,\r\nHow is it? Thou wert but a village maid,\r\n\r\nAnd thou seemest an angel lady white,\r\nThough thin, and wan, and past delight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lady smiled a flickering smile,\r\nAnd she pressed her temples hard the while.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou seest that Death for a woman can\r\nDo more than knighthood for a man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut show me the child thou callest mine,\r\nIs she out to-night in the ghost\xe2\x80\x99s sunshine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn St. Peter\xe2\x80\x99s Church she is playing on,\r\nAt hide-and-seek, with Apostle John.\r\n\r\nWhen the moonbeams right through the window go,\r\nWhere the twelve are standing in glorious show,\r\n\r\nShe says the rest of them do not stir,\r\nBut one comes down to play with her.\r\n\r\nThen I can go where I list, and weep,\r\nFor good St. John my child will keep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThy beauty filleth the very air,\r\nNever saw I a woman so fair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, if thou darest, and sit by my side;\r\nBut do not touch me, or woe will betide.\r\n\r\nAlas, I am weak: I might well know\r\nThis gladness betokens some further woe.\r\n\r\nYet come. It will come. I will bear it. I can.\r\nFor thou lovest me yet\xe2\x80\x94though but as a man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe knight dismounted in earnest speed;\r\nAway through the tombstones thundered the steed,\r\n\r\nAnd fell by the outer wall, and died.\r\nBut the knight he kneeled by the lady\xe2\x80\x99s side;\r\n\r\nKneeled beside her in wondrous bliss,\r\nRapt in an everlasting kiss:\r\n\r\nThough never his lips come the lady nigh,\r\nAnd his eyes alone on her beauty lie.\r\n\r\nAll the night long, till the cock crew loud,\r\nHe kneeled by the lady, lapt in her shroud.\r\n\r\nAnd what they said, I may not say:\r\nDead night was sweeter than living day.\r\n\r\nHow she made him so blissful glad\r\nWho made her and found her so ghostly sad,\r\n\r\nI may not tell; but it needs no touch\r\nTo make them blessed who love so much.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome every night, my ghost, to me;\r\nAnd one night I will come to thee.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tis good to have a ghostly wife:\r\nShe will not tremble at clang of strife;\r\n\r\nShe will only hearken, amid the din,\r\nBehind the door, if he cometh in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd this is how Sir Aglovaile\r\nOften walked in the moonlight pale.\r\n\r\nAnd oft when the crescent but thinned the gloom,\r\nFull orbed moonlight filled his room;\r\n\r\nAnd through beneath his chamber door,\r\nFell a ghostly gleam on the outer floor;\r\n\r\nAnd they that passed, in fear averred\r\nThat murmured words they often heard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Twas then that the eastern crescent shone\r\nThrough the chancel window, and good St. John\r\n\r\nPlayed with the ghost-child all the night,\r\nAnd the mother was free till the morning light,\r\n\r\nAnd sped through the dawning night, to stay\r\nWith Aglovaile till the break of day.\r\n\r\nAnd their love was a rapture, lone and high,\r\nAnd dumb as the moon in the topmost sky.\r\n\r\nOne night Sir Aglovaile, weary, slept\r\nAnd dreamed a dream wherein he wept.\r\n\r\nA warrior he was, not often wept he,\r\nBut this night he wept full bitterly.\r\n\r\nHe woke\xe2\x80\x94beside him the ghost-girl shone\r\nOut of the dark: \xe2\x80\x98twas the eve of St. John.\r\n\r\nHe had dreamed a dream of a still, dark wood,\r\nWhere the maiden of old beside him stood;\r\n\r\nBut a mist came down, and caught her away,\r\nAnd he sought her in vain through the pathless day,\r\n\r\nTill he wept with the grief that can do no more,\r\nAnd thought he had dreamt the dream before.\r\n\r\nFrom bursting heart the weeping flowed on;\r\nAnd lo! beside him the ghost-girl shone;\r\n\r\nShone like the light on a harbour\xe2\x80\x99s breast,\r\nOver the sea of his dream\xe2\x80\x99s unrest;\r\n\r\nShone like the wondrous, nameless boon,\r\nThat the heart seeks ever, night or noon:\r\n\r\nWarnings forgotten, when needed most,\r\nHe clasped to his bosom the radiant ghost.\r\n\r\nShe wailed aloud, and faded, and sank.\r\nWith upturn\xe2\x80\x99d white face, cold and blank,\r\n\r\nIn his arms lay the corpse of the maiden pale,\r\nAnd she came no more to Sir Aglovaile.\r\n\r\nOnly a voice, when winds were wild,\r\nSobbed and wailed like a chidden child.\r\n\r\n_Alas, how easily things go wrong!\r\nA sigh too much, or a kiss too long,\r\nAnd there follows a mist and a weeping rain,\r\nAnd life is never the same again._\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was one of the simplest of her songs, which, perhaps, is the cause\r\nof my being able to remember it better than most of the others. While\r\nshe sung, I was in Elysium, with the sense of a rich soul upholding,\r\nembracing, and overhanging mine, full of all plenty and bounty. I felt\r\nas if she could give me everything I wanted; as if I should never wish\r\nto leave her, but would be content to be sung to and fed by her, day\r\nafter day, as years rolled by. At last I fell asleep while she sang.\r\n\r\nWhen I awoke, I knew not whether it was night or day. The fire had sunk\r\nto a few red embers, which just gave light enough to show me the woman\r\nstanding a few feet from me, with her back towards me, facing the door\r\nby which I had entered. She was weeping, but very gently and\r\nplentifully. The tears seemed to come freely from her heart. Thus she\r\nstood for a few minutes; then, slowly turning at right angles to her\r\nformer position, she faced another of the four sides of the cottage. I\r\nnow observed, for the first time, that here was a door likewise; and\r\nthat, indeed, there was one in the centre of every side of the cottage.\r\n\r\nWhen she looked towards the second door, her tears ceased to flow, but\r\nsighs took their place. She often closed her eyes as she stood; and\r\nevery time she closed her eyes, a gentle sigh seemed to be born in her\r\nheart, and to escape at her lips. But when her eyes were open, her\r\nsighs were deep and very sad, and shook her whole frame. Then she\r\nturned towards the third door, and a cry as of fear or suppressed pain\r\nbroke from her; but she seemed to hearten herself against the dismay,\r\nand to front it steadily; for, although I often heard a slight cry, and\r\nsometimes a moan, yet she never moved or bent her head, and I felt sure\r\nthat her eyes never closed. Then she turned to the fourth door, and I\r\nsaw her shudder, and then stand still as a statue; till at last she\r\nturned towards me and approached the fire. I saw that her face was\r\nwhite as death. But she gave one look upwards, and smiled the sweetest,\r\nmost child-innocent smile; then heaped fresh wood on the fire, and,\r\nsitting down by the blaze, drew her wheel near her, and began to spin.\r\nWhile she spun, she murmured a low strange song, to which the hum of\r\nthe wheel made a kind of infinite symphony. At length she paused in her\r\nspinning and singing, and glanced towards me, like a mother who looks\r\nwhether or not her child gives signs of waking. She smiled when she saw\r\nthat my eyes were open. I asked her whether it was day yet. She\r\nanswered, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is always day here, so long as I keep my fire burning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI felt wonderfully refreshed; and a great desire to see more of the\r\nisland awoke within me. I rose, and saying that I wished to look about\r\nme, went towards the door by which I had entered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStay a moment,\xe2\x80\x9d said my hostess, with some trepidation in her voice.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen to me. You will not see what you expect when you go out of that\r\ndoor. Only remember this: whenever you wish to come back to me, enter\r\nwherever you see this mark.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe held up her left hand between me and the fire. Upon the palm, which\r\nappeared almost transparent, I saw, in dark red, a mark like this \xe2\x80\x94>\r\nwhich I took care to fix in my mind.\r\n\r\nShe then kissed me, and bade me good-bye with a solemnity that awed me;\r\nand bewildered me too, seeing I was only going out for a little ramble\r\nin an island, which I did not believe larger than could easily be\r\ncompassed in a few hours\xe2\x80\x99 walk at most. As I went she resumed her\r\nspinning.\r\n\r\nI opened the door, and stepped out. The moment my foot touched the\r\nsmooth sward, I seemed to issue from the door of an old barn on my\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s estate, where, in the hot afternoons, I used to go and lie\r\namongst the straw, and read. It seemed to me now that I had been asleep\r\nthere. At a little distance in the field, I saw two of my brothers at\r\nplay. The moment they caught sight of me, they called out to me to come\r\nand join them, which I did; and we played together as we had done years\r\nago, till the red sun went down in the west, and the gray fog began to\r\nrise from the river. Then we went home together with a strange\r\nhappiness. As we went, we heard the continually renewed larum of a\r\nlandrail in the long grass. One of my brothers and I separated to a\r\nlittle distance, and each commenced running towards the part whence the\r\nsound appeared to come, in the hope of approaching the spot where the\r\nbird was, and so getting at least a sight of it, if we should not be\r\nable to capture the little creature. My father\xe2\x80\x99s voice recalled us from\r\ntrampling down the rich long grass, soon to be cut down and laid aside\r\nfor the winter. I had quite forgotten all about Fairy Land, and the\r\nwonderful old woman, and the curious red mark.\r\n\r\nMy favourite brother and I shared the same bed. Some childish dispute\r\narose between us; and our last words, ere we fell asleep, were not of\r\nkindness, notwithstanding the pleasures of the day. When I woke in the\r\nmorning, I missed him. He had risen early, and had gone to bathe in the\r\nriver. In another hour, he was brought home drowned. Alas! alas! if we\r\nhad only gone to sleep as usual, the one with his arm about the other!\r\nAmidst the horror of the moment, a strange conviction flashed across my\r\nmind, that I had gone through the very same once before.\r\n\r\nI rushed out of the house, I knew not why, sobbing and crying bitterly.\r\nI ran through the fields in aimless distress, till, passing the old\r\nbarn, I caught sight of a red mark on the door. The merest trifles\r\nsometimes rivet the attention in the deepest misery; the intellect has\r\nso little to do with grief. I went up to look at this mark, which I did\r\nnot remember ever to have seen before. As I looked at it, I thought I\r\nwould go in and lie down amongst the straw, for I was very weary with\r\nrunning about and weeping. I opened the door; and there in the cottage\r\nsat the old woman as I had left her, at her spinning-wheel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not expect you quite so soon,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, as I shut the door\r\nbehind me. I went up to the couch, and threw myself on it with that\r\nfatigue wherewith one awakes from a feverish dream of hopeless grief.\r\n\r\nThe old woman sang:\r\n\r\nThe great sun, benighted,\r\n    May faint from the sky;\r\nBut love, once uplighted,\r\n    Will never more die.\r\n\r\nForm, with its brightness,\r\n    From eyes will depart:\r\nIt walketh, in whiteness,\r\n    The halls of the heart.\r\n\r\n\r\nEre she had ceased singing, my courage had returned. I started from the\r\ncouch, and, without taking leave of the old woman, opened the door of\r\nSighs, and sprang into what should appear.\r\n\r\nI stood in a lordly hall, where, by a blazing fire on the hearth, sat a\r\nlady, waiting, I knew, for some one long desired. A mirror was near me,\r\nbut I saw that my form had no place within its depths, so I feared not\r\nthat I should be seen. The lady wonderfully resembled my marble lady,\r\nbut was altogether of the daughters of men, and I could not tell\r\nwhether or not it was she.\r\n\r\nIt was not for me she waited. The tramp of a great horse rang through\r\nthe court without. It ceased, and the clang of armour told that his\r\nrider alighted, and the sound of his ringing heels approached the hall.\r\nThe door opened; but the lady waited, for she would meet her lord\r\nalone. He strode in: she flew like a home-bound dove into his arms, and\r\nnestled on the hard steel. It was the knight of the soiled armour. But\r\nnow the armour shone like polished glass; and strange to tell, though\r\nthe mirror reflected not my form, I saw a dim shadow of myself in the\r\nshining steel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO my beloved, thou art come, and I am blessed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer soft fingers speedily overcame the hard clasp of his helmet; one by\r\none she undid the buckles of his armour; and she toiled under the\r\nweight of the mail, as she _would_ carry it aside. Then she unclasped\r\nhis greaves, and unbuckled his spurs; and once more she sprang into his\r\narms, and laid her head where she could now feel the beating of his\r\nheart. Then she disengaged herself from his embrace, and, moving back a\r\nstep or two, gazed at him. He stood there a mighty form, crowned with a\r\nnoble head, where all sadness had disappeared, or had been absorbed in\r\nsolemn purpose. Yet I suppose that he looked more thoughtful than the\r\nlady had expected to see him, for she did not renew her caresses,\r\nalthough his face glowed with love, and the few words he spoke were as\r\nmighty deeds for strength; but she led him towards the hearth, and\r\nseated him in an ancient chair, and set wine before him, and sat at his\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sad,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen I think of the youth whom I met twice in the\r\nforests of Fairy Land; and who, you say, twice, with his songs, roused\r\nyou from the death-sleep of an evil enchantment. There was something\r\nnoble in him, but it was a nobleness of thought, and not of deed. He\r\nmay yet perish of vile fear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d returned the lady, \xe2\x80\x9cyou saved him once, and for that I thank you;\r\nfor may I not say that I somewhat loved him? But tell me how you fared,\r\nwhen you struck your battle-axe into the ash-tree, and he came and\r\nfound you; for so much of the story you had told me, when the\r\nbeggar-child came and took you away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs soon as I saw him,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the knight, \xe2\x80\x9cI knew that earthly arms\r\navailed not against such as he; and that my soul must meet him in its\r\nnaked strength. So I unclasped my helm, and flung it on the ground;\r\nand, holding my good axe yet in my hand, gazed at him with steady eyes.\r\nOn he came, a horror indeed, but I did not flinch. Endurance must\r\nconquer, where force could not reach. He came nearer and nearer, till\r\nthe ghastly face was close to mine. A shudder as of death ran through\r\nme; but I think I did not move, for he seemed to quail, and retreated.\r\nAs soon as he gave back, I struck one more sturdy blow on the stem of\r\nhis tree, that the forest rang; and then looked at him again. He\r\nwrithed and grinned with rage and apparent pain, and again approached\r\nme, but retreated sooner than before. I heeded him no more, but hewed\r\nwith a will at the tree, till the trunk creaked, and the head bowed,\r\nand with a crash it fell to the earth. Then I looked up from my labour,\r\nand lo! the spectre had vanished, and I saw him no more; nor ever in my\r\nwanderings have I heard of him again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell struck! well withstood! my hero,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d said the knight, somewhat troubled, \xe2\x80\x9cdost thou love the youth\r\nstill?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, \xe2\x80\x9chow can I help it? He woke me from worse than\r\ndeath; he loved me. I had never been for thee, if he had not sought me\r\nfirst. But I love him not as I love thee. He was but the moon of my\r\nnight; thou art the sun of my day, O beloved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou art right,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the noble man. \xe2\x80\x9cIt were hard, indeed, not to\r\nhave some love in return for such a gift as he hath given thee. I, too,\r\nowe him more than words can speak.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHumbled before them, with an aching and desolate heart, I yet could not\r\nrestrain my words:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me, then, be the moon of thy night still, O woman! And when thy\r\nday is beclouded, as the fairest days will be, let some song of mine\r\ncomfort thee, as an old, withered, half-forgotten thing, that belongs\r\nto an ancient mournful hour of uncompleted birth, which yet was\r\nbeautiful in its time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey sat silent, and I almost thought they were listening. The colour\r\nof the lady\xe2\x80\x99s eyes grew deeper and deeper; the slow tears grew, and\r\nfilled them, and overflowed. They rose, and passed, hand in hand, close\r\nto where I stood; and each looked towards me in passing. Then they\r\ndisappeared through a door which closed behind them; but, ere it\r\nclosed, I saw that the room into which it opened was a rich chamber,\r\nhung with gorgeous arras. I stood with an ocean of sighs frozen in my\r\nbosom. I could remain no longer. She was near me, and I could not see\r\nher; near me in the arms of one loved better than I, and I would not\r\nsee her, and I would not be by her. But how to escape from the nearness\r\nof the best beloved? I had not this time forgotten the mark; for the\r\nfact that I could not enter the sphere of these living beings kept me\r\naware that, for me, I moved in a vision, while they moved in life. I\r\nlooked all about for the mark, but could see it nowhere; for I avoided\r\nlooking just where it was. There the dull red cipher glowed, on the\r\nvery door of their secret chamber. Struck with agony, I dashed it open,\r\nand fell at the feet of the ancient woman, who still spun on, the whole\r\ndissolved ocean of my sighs bursting from me in a storm of tearless\r\nsobs. Whether I fainted or slept, I do not know; but, as I returned to\r\nconsciousness, before I seemed to have power to move, I heard the woman\r\nsinging, and could distinguish the words:\r\n\r\nO light of dead and of dying days!\r\n    O Love! in thy glory go,\r\nIn a rosy mist and a moony maze,\r\n    O\xe2\x80\x99er the pathless peaks of snow.\r\n\r\nBut what is left for the cold gray soul,\r\n    That moans like a wounded dove?\r\nOne wine is left in the broken bowl!\xe2\x80\x94\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98Tis\xe2\x80\x94_To love, and love and love_.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow I could weep. When she saw me weeping, she sang:\r\n\r\nBetter to sit at the waters\xe2\x80\x99 birth,\r\n    Than a sea of waves to win;\r\nTo live in the love that floweth forth,\r\n    Than the love that cometh in.\r\n\r\nBe thy heart a well of love, my child,\r\n    Flowing, and free, and sure;\r\nFor a cistern of love, though undefiled,\r\n    Keeps not the spirit pure.\r\n\r\n\r\nI rose from the earth, loving the white lady as I had never loved her\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nThen I walked up to the door of Dismay, and opened it, and went out.\r\nAnd lo! I came forth upon a crowded street, where men and women went to\r\nand fro in multitudes. I knew it well; and, turning to one hand, walked\r\nsadly along the pavement. Suddenly I saw approaching me, a little way\r\noff, a form well known to me (_well-known!_\xe2\x80\x94alas, how weak the word!)\r\nin the years when I thought my boyhood was left behind, and shortly\r\nbefore I entered the realm of Fairy Land. Wrong and Sorrow had gone\r\ntogether, hand-in-hand as it is well they do.\r\n\r\nUnchangeably dear was that face. It lay in my heart as a child lies in\r\nits own white bed; but I could not meet her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnything but that,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, and, turning aside, sprang up the steps to\r\na door, on which I fancied I saw the mystic sign. I entered\xe2\x80\x94not the\r\nmysterious cottage, but her home. I rushed wildly on, and stood by the\r\ndoor of her room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is out,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cI will see the old room once more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI opened the door gently, and stood in a great solemn church. A\r\ndeep-toned bell, whose sounds throbbed and echoed and swam through the\r\nempty building, struck the hour of midnight. The moon shone through the\r\nwindows of the clerestory, and enough of the ghostly radiance was\r\ndiffused through the church to let me see, walking with a stately, yet\r\nsomewhat trailing and stumbling step, down the opposite aisle, for I\r\nstood in one of the transepts, a figure dressed in a white robe,\r\nwhether for the night, or for that longer night which lies too deep for\r\nthe day, I could not tell. Was it she? and was this her chamber? I\r\ncrossed the church, and followed. The figure stopped, seemed to ascend\r\nas it were a high bed, and lay down. I reached the place where it lay,\r\nglimmering white. The bed was a tomb. The light was too ghostly to see\r\nclearly, but I passed my hand over the face and the hands and the feet,\r\nwhich were all bare. They were cold\xe2\x80\x94they were marble, but I knew them.\r\nIt grew dark. I turned to retrace my steps, but found, ere long, that I\r\nhad wandered into what seemed a little chapel. I groped about, seeking\r\nthe door. Everything I touched belonged to the dead. My hands fell on\r\nthe cold effigy of a knight who lay with his legs crossed and his sword\r\nbroken beside him. He lay in his noble rest, and I lived on in ignoble\r\nstrife. I felt for the left hand and a certain finger; I found there\r\nthe ring I knew: he was one of my own ancestors. I was in the chapel\r\nover the burial-vault of my race. I called aloud: \xe2\x80\x9cIf any of the dead\r\nare moving here, let them take pity upon me, for I, alas! am still\r\nalive; and let some dead woman comfort me, for I am a stranger in the\r\nland of the dead, and see no light.\xe2\x80\x9d A warm kiss alighted on my lips\r\nthrough the dark. And I said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe dead kiss well; I will not be\r\nafraid.\xe2\x80\x9d And a great hand was reached out of the dark, and grasped mine\r\nfor a moment, mightily and tenderly. I said to myself: \xe2\x80\x9cThe veil\r\nbetween, though very dark, is very thin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGroping my way further, I stumbled over the heavy stone that covered\r\nthe entrance of the vault: and, in stumbling, descried upon the stone\r\nthe mark, glowing in red fire. I caught the great ring. All my effort\r\ncould not have moved the huge slab; but it opened the door of the\r\ncottage, and I threw myself once more, pale and speechless, on the\r\ncouch beside the ancient dame. She sang once more:\r\n\r\nThou dreamest: on a rock thou art,\r\n    High o\xe2\x80\x99er the broken wave;\r\nThou fallest with a fearful start\r\n    But not into thy grave;\r\nFor, waking in the morning\xe2\x80\x99s light,\r\nThou smilest at the vanished night\r\n\r\nSo wilt thou sink, all pale and dumb,\r\n    Into the fainting gloom;\r\nBut ere the coming terrors come,\r\n    Thou wak\xe2\x80\x99st\xe2\x80\x94where is the tomb?\r\nThou wak\xe2\x80\x99st\xe2\x80\x94the dead ones smile above,\r\nWith hovering arms of sleepless love.\r\n\r\n\r\nShe paused; then sang again:\r\n\r\nWe weep for gladness, weep for grief;\r\n    The tears they are the same;\r\nWe sigh for longing, and relief;\r\n    The sighs have but one name,\r\n\r\nAnd mingled in the dying strife,\r\n    Are moans that are not sad\r\nThe pangs of death are throbs of life,\r\n    Its sighs are sometimes glad.\r\n\r\nThe face is very strange and white:\r\n    It is Earth\xe2\x80\x99s only spot\r\nThat feebly flickers back the light\r\n    The living seeth not.\r\n\r\n\r\nI fell asleep, and slept a dreamless sleep, for I know not how long.\r\nWhen I awoke, I found that my hostess had moved from where she had been\r\nsitting, and now sat between me and the fourth door.\r\n\r\nI guessed that her design was to prevent my entering there. I sprang\r\nfrom the couch, and darted past her to the door. I opened it at once\r\nand went out. All I remember is a cry of distress from the woman:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t go there, my child! Don\xe2\x80\x99t go there!\xe2\x80\x9d But I was gone.\r\n\r\nI knew nothing more; or, if I did, I had forgot it all when I awoke to\r\nconsciousness, lying on the floor of the cottage, with my head in the\r\nlap of the woman, who was weeping over me, and stroking my hair with\r\nboth hands, talking to me as a mother might talk to a sick and\r\nsleeping, or a dead child. As soon as I looked up and saw her, she\r\nsmiled through her tears; smiled with withered face and young eyes,\r\ntill her countenance was irradiated with the light of the smile. Then\r\nshe bathed my head and face and hands in an icy cold, colourless\r\nliquid, which smelt a little of damp earth. Immediately I was able to\r\nsit up. She rose and put some food before me. When I had eaten, she\r\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x9cListen to me, my child. You must leave me directly!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave you!\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cI am so happy with you. I never was so happy in\r\nmy life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you must go,\xe2\x80\x9d she rejoined sadly. \xe2\x80\x9cListen! What do you hear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hear the sound as of a great throbbing of water.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! you do hear it? Well, I had to go through that door\xe2\x80\x94the door of\r\nthe Timeless\xe2\x80\x9d (and she shuddered as she pointed to the fourth door)\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cto\r\nfind you; for if I had not gone, you would never have entered again;\r\nand because I went, the waters around my cottage will rise and rise,\r\nand flow and come, till they build a great firmament of waters over my\r\ndwelling. But as long as I keep my fire burning, they cannot enter. I\r\nhave fuel enough for years; and after one year they will sink away\r\nagain, and be just as they were before you came. I have not been buried\r\nfor a hundred years now.\xe2\x80\x9d And she smiled and wept.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas! alas!\xe2\x80\x9d I cried. \xe2\x80\x9cI have brought this evil on the best and\r\nkindest of friends, who has filled my heart with great gifts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not think of that,\xe2\x80\x9d she rejoined. \xe2\x80\x9cI can bear it very well. You\r\nwill come back to me some day, I know. But I beg you, for my sake, my\r\ndear child, to do one thing. In whatever sorrow you may be, however\r\ninconsolable and irremediable it may appear, believe me that the old\r\nwoman in the cottage, with the young eyes\xe2\x80\x9d (and she smiled), \xe2\x80\x9cknows\r\nsomething, though she must not always tell it, that would quite satisfy\r\nyou about it, even in the worst moments of your distress. Now you must\r\ngo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how can I go, if the waters are all about, and if the doors all\r\nlead into other regions and other worlds?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is not an island,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied; \xe2\x80\x9cbut is joined to the land by a\r\nnarrow neck; and for the door, I will lead you myself through the right\r\none.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe took my hand, and led me through the third door; whereupon I found\r\nmyself standing in the deep grassy turf on which I had landed from the\r\nlittle boat, but upon the opposite side of the cottage. She pointed out\r\nthe direction I must take, to find the isthmus and escape the rising\r\nwaters.\r\n\r\nThen putting her arms around me, she held me to her bosom; and as I\r\nkissed her, I felt as if I were leaving my mother for the first time,\r\nand could not help weeping bitterly. At length she gently pushed me\r\naway, and with the words, \xe2\x80\x9cGo, my son, and do something worth doing,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nturned back, and, entering the cottage, closed the door behind her. I\r\nfelt very desolate as I went.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou hadst no fame; that which thou didst like good\r\nWas but thy appetite that swayed thy blood\r\nFor that time to the best; for as a blast\r\nThat through a house comes, usually doth cast\r\nThings out of order, yet by chance may come\r\nAnd blow some one thing to his proper room,\r\nSo did thy appetite, and not thy zeal,\r\nSway thee by chance to do some one thing well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n          FLETCHER\xe2\x80\x99S _Faithful Shepherdess_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe noble hart that harbours vertuous thought\r\nAnd is with childe of glorious great intent,\r\nCan never rest, until it forth have brought\r\nTh\xe2\x80\x99 eternall brood of glorie excellent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n          SPENSER, _The Faerie Queene_.\r\n\r\n\r\nI had not gone very far before I felt that the turf beneath my feet was\r\nsoaked with the rising waters. But I reached the isthmus in safety. It\r\nwas rocky, and so much higher than the level of the peninsula, that I\r\nhad plenty of time to cross. I saw on each side of me the water rising\r\nrapidly, altogether without wind, or violent motion, or broken waves,\r\nbut as if a slow strong fire were glowing beneath it. Ascending a steep\r\nacclivity, I found myself at last in an open, rocky country. After\r\ntravelling for some hours, as nearly in a straight line as I could, I\r\narrived at a lonely tower, built on the top of a little hill, which\r\noverlooked the whole neighbouring country. As I approached, I heard the\r\nclang of an anvil; and so rapid were the blows, that I despaired of\r\nmaking myself heard till a pause in the work should ensue. It was some\r\nminutes before a cessation took place; but when it did, I knocked\r\nloudly, and had not long to wait; for, a moment after, the door was\r\npartly opened by a noble-looking youth, half-undressed, glowing with\r\nheat, and begrimed with the blackness of the forge. In one hand he held\r\na sword, so lately from the furnace that it yet shone with a dull fire.\r\nAs soon as he saw me, he threw the door wide open, and standing aside,\r\ninvited me very cordially to enter. I did so; when he shut and bolted\r\nthe door most carefully, and then led the way inwards. He brought me\r\ninto a rude hall, which seemed to occupy almost the whole of the ground\r\nfloor of the little tower, and which I saw was now being used as a\r\nworkshop. A huge fire roared on the hearth, beside which was an anvil.\r\nBy the anvil stood, in similar undress, and in a waiting attitude,\r\nhammer in hand, a second youth, tall as the former, but far more\r\nslightly built. Reversing the usual course of perception in such\r\nmeetings, I thought them, at first sight, very unlike; and at the\r\nsecond glance, knew that they were brothers. The former, and apparently\r\nthe elder, was muscular and dark, with curling hair, and large hazel\r\neyes, which sometimes grew wondrously soft. The second was slender and\r\nfair, yet with a countenance like an eagle, and an eye which, though\r\npale blue, shone with an almost fierce expression. He stood erect, as\r\nif looking from a lofty mountain crag, over a vast plain outstretched\r\nbelow. As soon as we entered the hall, the elder turned to me, and I\r\nsaw that a glow of satisfaction shone on both their faces. To my\r\nsurprise and great pleasure, he addressed me thus:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBrother, will you sit by the fire and rest, till we finish this part\r\nof our work?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI signified my assent; and, resolved to await any disclosure they might\r\nbe inclined to make, seated myself in silence near the hearth.\r\n\r\nThe elder brother then laid the sword in the fire, covered it well\r\nover, and when it had attained a sufficient degree of heat, drew it out\r\nand laid it on the anvil, moving it carefully about, while the younger,\r\nwith a succession of quick smart blows, appeared either to be welding\r\nit, or hammering one part of it to a consenting shape with the rest.\r\nHaving finished, they laid it carefully in the fire; and, when it was\r\nvery hot indeed, plunged it into a vessel full of some liquid, whence a\r\nblue flame sprang upwards, as the glowing steel entered.\r\n\r\nThere they left it; and drawing two stools to the fire, sat down, one\r\non each side of me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are very glad to see you, brother. We have been expecting you for\r\nsome days,\xe2\x80\x9d said the dark-haired youth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am proud to be called your brother,\xe2\x80\x9d I rejoined; \xe2\x80\x9cand you will not\r\nthink I refuse the name, if I desire to know why you honour me with\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! then he does not know about it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the younger. \xe2\x80\x9cWe thought you\r\nhad known of the bond betwixt us, and the work we have to do together.\r\nYou must tell him, brother, from the first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo the elder began:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur father is king of this country. Before we were born, three giant\r\nbrothers had appeared in the land. No one knew exactly when, and no one\r\nhad the least idea whence they came. They took possession of a ruined\r\ncastle that had stood unchanged and unoccupied within the memory of any\r\nof the country people. The vaults of this castle had remained uninjured\r\nby time, and these, I presume, they made use of at first. They were\r\nrarely seen, and never offered the least injury to any one; so that\r\nthey were regarded in the neighbourhood as at least perfectly harmless,\r\nif not rather benevolent beings. But it began to be observed, that the\r\nold castle had assumed somehow or other, no one knew when or how, a\r\nsomewhat different look from what it used to have. Not only were\r\nseveral breaches in the lower part of the walls built up, but actually\r\nsome of the battlements which yet stood, had been repaired, apparently\r\nto prevent them from falling into worse decay, while the more important\r\nparts were being restored. Of course, every one supposed the giants\r\nmust have a hand in the work, but no one ever saw them engaged in it.\r\nThe peasants became yet more uneasy, after one, who had concealed\r\nhimself, and watched all night, in the neighbourhood of the castle,\r\nreported that he had seen, in full moonlight, the three huge giants\r\nworking with might and main, all night long, restoring to their former\r\nposition some massive stones, formerly steps of a grand turnpike stair,\r\na great portion of which had long since fallen, along with part of the\r\nwall of the round tower in which it had been built. This wall they were\r\ncompleting, foot by foot, along with the stair. But the people said\r\nthey had no just pretext for interfering: although the real reason for\r\nletting the giants alone was, that everybody was far too much afraid of\r\nthem to interrupt them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt length, with the help of a neighbouring quarry, the whole of the\r\nexternal wall of the castle was finished. And now the country folks\r\nwere in greater fear than before. But for several years the giants\r\nremained very peaceful. The reason of this was afterwards supposed to\r\nbe the fact, that they were distantly related to several good people in\r\nthe country; for, as long as these lived, they remained quiet; but as\r\nsoon as they were all dead the real nature of the giants broke out.\r\nHaving completed the outside of their castle, they proceeded, by\r\nspoiling the country houses around them, to make a quiet luxurious\r\nprovision for their comfort within. Affairs reached such a pass, that\r\nthe news of their robberies came to my father\xe2\x80\x99s ears; but he, alas! was\r\nso crippled in his resources, by a war he was carrying on with a\r\nneighbouring prince, that he could only spare a very few men, to\r\nattempt the capture of their stronghold. Upon these the giants issued\r\nin the night, and slew every man of them. And now, grown bolder by\r\nsuccess and impunity, they no longer confined their depredations to\r\nproperty, but began to seize the persons of their distinguished\r\nneighbours, knights and ladies, and hold them in durance, the misery of\r\nwhich was heightened by all manner of indignity, until they were\r\nredeemed by their friends, at an exorbitant ransom. Many knights have\r\nadventured their overthrow, but to their own instead; for they have all\r\nbeen slain, or captured, or forced to make a hasty retreat. To crown\r\ntheir enormities, if any man now attempts their destruction, they,\r\nimmediately upon his defeat, put one or more of their captives to a\r\nshameful death, on a turret in sight of all passers-by; so that they\r\nhave been much less molested of late; and we, although we have burned,\r\nfor years, to attack these demons and destroy them, dared not, for the\r\nsake of their captives, risk the adventure, before we should have\r\nreached at least our earliest manhood. Now, however, we are preparing\r\nfor the attempt; and the grounds of this preparation are these. Having\r\nonly the resolution, and not the experience necessary for the\r\nundertaking, we went and consulted a lonely woman of wisdom, who lives\r\nnot very far from here, in the direction of the quarter from which you\r\nhave come. She received us most kindly, and gave us what seems to us\r\nthe best of advice. She first inquired what experience we had had in\r\narms. We told her we had been well exercised from our boyhood, and for\r\nsome years had kept ourselves in constant practice, with a view to this\r\nnecessity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98But you have not actually fought for life and death?\xe2\x80\x99 said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe were forced to confess we had not.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98So much the better in some respects,\xe2\x80\x99 she replied. \xe2\x80\x98Now listen to me.\r\nGo first and work with an armourer, for as long time as you find\r\nneedful to obtain a knowledge of his craft; which will not be long,\r\nseeing your hearts will be all in the work. Then go to some lonely\r\ntower, you two alone. Receive no visits from man or woman. There forge\r\nfor yourselves every piece of armour that you wish to wear, or to use,\r\nin your coming encounter. And keep up your exercises. As, however, two\r\nof you can be no match for the three giants, I will find you, if I can,\r\na third brother, who will take on himself the third share of the fight,\r\nand the preparation. Indeed, I have already seen one who will, I think,\r\nbe the very man for your fellowship, but it will be some time before he\r\ncomes to me. He is wandering now without an aim. I will show him to you\r\nin a glass, and, when he comes, you will know him at once. If he will\r\nshare your endeavours, you must teach him all you know, and he will\r\nrepay you well, in present song, and in future deeds.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe opened the door of a curious old cabinet that stood in the room.\r\nOn the inside of this door was an oval convex mirror. Looking in it for\r\nsome time, we at length saw reflected the place where we stood, and the\r\nold dame seated in her chair. Our forms were not reflected. But at the\r\nfeet of the dame lay a young man, yourself, weeping.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Surely this youth will not serve our ends,\xe2\x80\x99 said I, \xe2\x80\x98for he weeps.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe old woman smiled. \xe2\x80\x98Past tears are present strength,\xe2\x80\x99 said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Oh!\xe2\x80\x99 said my brother, \xe2\x80\x98I saw you weep once over an eagle you shot.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98That was because it was so like you, brother,\xe2\x80\x99 I replied; \xe2\x80\x98but\r\nindeed, this youth may have better cause for tears than that\xe2\x80\x94I was\r\nwrong.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Wait a while,\xe2\x80\x99 said the woman; \xe2\x80\x98if I mistake not, he will make you\r\nweep till your tears are dry for ever. Tears are the only cure for\r\nweeping. And you may have need of the cure, before you go forth to\r\nfight the giants. You must wait for him, in your tower, till he comes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow if you will join us, we will soon teach you to make your armour;\r\nand we will fight together, and work together, and love each other as\r\nnever three loved before. And you will sing to us, will you not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I will, when I can,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered; \xe2\x80\x9cbut it is only at times that\r\nthe power of song comes upon me. For that I must wait; but I have a\r\nfeeling that if I work well, song will not be far off to enliven the\r\nlabour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was all the compact made: the brothers required nothing more, and\r\nI did not think of giving anything more. I rose, and threw off my upper\r\ngarments.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know the uses of the sword,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cI am ashamed of my white hands\r\nbeside yours so nobly soiled and hard; but that shame will soon be\r\nwiped away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no; we will not work to-day. Rest is as needful as toil. Bring the\r\nwine, brother; it is your turn to serve to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe younger brother soon covered a table with rough viands, but good\r\nwine; and we ate and drank heartily, beside our work. Before the meal\r\nwas over, I had learned all their story. Each had something in his\r\nheart which made the conviction, that he would victoriously perish in\r\nthe coming conflict, a real sorrow to him. Otherwise they thought they\r\nwould have lived enough. The causes of their trouble were respectively\r\nthese:\r\n\r\nWhile they wrought with an armourer, in a city famed for workmanship in\r\nsteel and silver, the elder had fallen in love with a lady as far\r\nbeneath him in real rank, as she was above the station he had as\r\napprentice to an armourer. Nor did he seek to further his suit by\r\ndiscovering himself; but there was simply so much manhood about him,\r\nthat no one ever thought of rank when in his company. This is what his\r\nbrother said about it. The lady could not help loving him in return. He\r\ntold her when he left her, that he had a perilous adventure before him,\r\nand that when it was achieved, she would either see him return to claim\r\nher, or hear that he had died with honour. The younger brother\xe2\x80\x99s grief\r\narose from the fact, that, if they were both slain, his old father, the\r\nking, would be childless. His love for his father was so exceeding,\r\nthat to one unable to sympathise with it, it would have appeared\r\nextravagant. Both loved him equally at heart; but the love of the\r\nyounger had been more developed, because his thoughts and anxieties had\r\nnot been otherwise occupied. When at home, he had been his constant\r\ncompanion; and, of late, had ministered to the infirmities of his\r\ngrowing age. The youth was never weary of listening to the tales of his\r\nsire\xe2\x80\x99s youthful adventures; and had not yet in the smallest degree lost\r\nthe conviction, that his father was the greatest man in the world. The\r\ngrandest triumph possible to his conception was, to return to his\r\nfather, laden with the spoils of one of the hated giants. But they both\r\nwere in some dread, lest the thought of the loneliness of these two\r\nmight occur to them, in the moment when decision was most necessary,\r\nand disturb, in some degree, the self-possession requisite for the\r\nsuccess of their attempt. For, as I have said, they were yet untried in\r\nactual conflict. \xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d thought I, \xe2\x80\x9cI see to what the powers of my gift\r\nmust minister.\xe2\x80\x9d For my own part, I did not dread death, for I had\r\nnothing to care to live for; but I dreaded the encounter because of the\r\nresponsibility connected with it. I resolved however to work hard, and\r\nthus grow cool, and quick, and forceful.\r\n\r\nThe time passed away in work and song, in talk and ramble, in friendly\r\nfight and brotherly aid. I would not forge for myself armour of heavy\r\nmail like theirs, for I was not so powerful as they, and depended more\r\nfor any success I might secure, upon nimbleness of motion, certainty of\r\neye, and ready response of hand. Therefore I began to make for myself a\r\nshirt of steel plates and rings; which work, while more troublesome,\r\nwas better suited to me than the heavier labour. Much assistance did\r\nthe brothers give me, even after, by their instructions, I was able to\r\nmake some progress alone. Their work was in a moment abandoned, to\r\nrender any required aid to mine. As the old woman had promised, I tried\r\nto repay them with song; and many were the tears they both shed over my\r\nballads and dirges. The songs they liked best to hear were two which I\r\nmade for them. They were not half so good as many others I knew,\r\nespecially some I had learned from the wise woman in the cottage; but\r\nwhat comes nearest to our needs we like the best.\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe king sat on his throne\r\n    Glowing in gold and red;\r\nThe crown in his right hand shone,\r\n    And the gray hairs crowned his head.\r\n\r\nHis only son walks in,\r\n    And in walls of steel he stands:\r\nMake me, O father, strong to win,\r\n    With the blessing of holy hands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe knelt before his sire,\r\n    Who blessed him with feeble smile\r\nHis eyes shone out with a kingly fire,\r\n    But his old lips quivered the while.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo to the fight, my son,\r\n    Bring back the giant\xe2\x80\x99s head;\r\nAnd the crown with which my brows have done,\r\n    Shall glitter on thine instead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father, I seek no crowns,\r\n    But unspoken praise from thee;\r\nFor thy people\xe2\x80\x99s good, and thy renown,\r\n    I will die to set them free.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe king sat down and waited there,\r\n    And rose not, night nor day;\r\nTill a sound of shouting filled the air,\r\n    And cries of a sore dismay.\r\n\r\nThen like a king he sat once more,\r\n    With the crown upon his head;\r\nAnd up to the throne the people bore\r\n    A mighty giant dead.\r\n\r\nAnd up to the throne the people bore\r\n    A pale and lifeless boy.\r\nThe king rose up like a prophet of yore,\r\n    In a lofty, deathlike joy.\r\n\r\nHe put the crown on the chilly brow:\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cThou should\xe2\x80\x99st have reigned with me\r\nBut Death is the king of both, and now\r\n    I go to obey with thee.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely some good in me there lay,\r\n    To beget the noble one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThe old man smiled like a winter day,\r\n    And fell beside his son.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO lady, thy lover is dead,\xe2\x80\x9d they cried;\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cHe is dead, but hath slain the foe;\r\nHe hath left his name to be magnified\r\n    In a song of wonder and woe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas! I am well repaid,\xe2\x80\x9d said she,\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cWith a pain that stings like joy:\r\nFor I feared, from his tenderness to me,\r\n    That he was but a feeble boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow I shall hold my head on high,\r\n    The queen among my kind;\r\nIf ye hear a sound, \xe2\x80\x98tis only a sigh\r\n    For a glory left behind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first three times I sang these songs they both wept passionately.\r\nBut after the third time, they wept no more. Their eyes shone, and\r\ntheir faces grew pale, but they never wept at any of my songs again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI put my life in my hands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n          _The Book of Judges_.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt length, with much toil and equal delight, our armour was finished.\r\nWe armed each other, and tested the strength of the defence, with many\r\nblows of loving force. I was inferior in strength to both my brothers,\r\nbut a little more agile than either; and upon this agility, joined to\r\nprecision in hitting with the point of my weapon, I grounded my hopes\r\nof success in the ensuing combat. I likewise laboured to develop yet\r\nmore the keenness of sight with which I was naturally gifted; and, from\r\nthe remarks of my companions, I soon learned that my endeavours were\r\nnot in vain.\r\n\r\nThe morning arrived on which we had determined to make the attempt, and\r\nsucceed or perish\xe2\x80\x94perhaps both. We had resolved to fight on foot;\r\nknowing that the mishap of many of the knights who had made the\r\nattempt, had resulted from the fright of their horses at the appearance\r\nof the giants; and believing with Sir Gawain, that, though mare\xe2\x80\x99s sons\r\nmight be false to us, the earth would never prove a traitor. But most\r\nof our preparations were, in their immediate aim at least, frustrated.\r\n\r\nWe rose, that fatal morning, by daybreak. We had rested from all labour\r\nthe day before, and now were fresh as the lark. We bathed in cold\r\nspring water, and dressed ourselves in clean garments, with a sense of\r\npreparation, as for a solemn festivity. When we had broken our fast, I\r\ntook an old lyre, which I had found in the tower and had myself\r\nrepaired, and sung for the last time the two ballads of which I have\r\nsaid so much already. I followed them with this, for a closing song:\r\n\r\nOh, well for him who breaks his dream\r\n    With the blow that ends the strife\r\nAnd, waking, knows the peace that flows\r\n    Around the pain of life!\r\n\r\nWe are dead, my brothers! Our bodies clasp,\r\n    As an armour, our souls about;\r\nThis hand is the battle-axe I grasp,\r\n    And this my hammer stout.\r\n\r\nFear not, my brothers, for we are dead;\r\n    No noise can break our rest;\r\nThe calm of the grave is about the head,\r\n    And the heart heaves not the breast.\r\n\r\nAnd our life we throw to our people back,\r\n    To live with, a further store;\r\nWe leave it them, that there be no lack\r\n    In the land where we live no more.\r\n\r\nOh, well for him who breaks his dream\r\n    With the blow that ends the strife\r\nAnd, waking, knows the peace that flows\r\n    Around the noise of life!\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the last few tones of the instrument were following, like a dirge,\r\nthe death of the song, we all sprang to our feet. For, through one of\r\nthe little windows of the tower, towards which I had looked as I sang,\r\nI saw, suddenly rising over the edge of the slope on which our tower\r\nstood, three enormous heads. The brothers knew at once, by my looks,\r\nwhat caused my sudden movement. We were utterly unarmed, and there was\r\nno time to arm.\r\n\r\nBut we seemed to adopt the same resolution simultaneously; for each\r\ncaught up his favourite weapon, and, leaving his defence behind, sprang\r\nto the door. I snatched up a long rapier, abruptly, but very finely\r\npointed, in my sword-hand, and in the other a sabre; the elder brother\r\nseized his heavy battle-axe; and the younger, a great, two-handed\r\nsword, which he wielded in one hand like a feather. We had just time to\r\nget clear of the tower, embrace and say good-bye, and part to some\r\nlittle distance, that we might not encumber each other\xe2\x80\x99s motions, ere\r\nthe triple giant-brotherhood drew near to attack us. They were about\r\ntwice our height, and armed to the teeth. Through the visors of their\r\nhelmets their monstrous eyes shone with a horrible ferocity. I was in\r\nthe middle position, and the middle giant approached me. My eyes were\r\nbusy with his armour, and I was not a moment in settling my mode of\r\nattack. I saw that his body-armour was somewhat clumsily made, and that\r\nthe overlappings in the lower part had more play than necessary; and I\r\nhoped that, in a fortunate moment, some joint would open a little, in a\r\nvisible and accessible part. I stood till he came near enough to aim a\r\nblow at me with the mace, which has been, in all ages, the favourite\r\nweapon of giants, when, of course, I leaped aside, and let the blow\r\nfall upon the spot where I had been standing. I expected this would\r\nstrain the joints of his armour yet more. Full of fury, he made at me\r\nagain; but I kept him busy, constantly eluding his blows, and hoping\r\nthus to fatigue him. He did not seem to fear any assault from me, and I\r\nattempted none as yet; but while I watched his motions in order to\r\navoid his blows, I, at the same time, kept equal watch upon those\r\njoints of his armour, through some one of which I hoped to reach his\r\nlife. At length, as if somewhat fatigued, he paused a moment, and drew\r\nhimself slightly up; I bounded forward, foot and hand, ran my rapier\r\nright through to the armour of his back, let go the hilt, and passing\r\nunder his right arm, turned as he fell, and flew at him with my sabre.\r\nAt one happy blow I divided the band of his helmet, which fell off, and\r\nallowed me, with a second cut across the eyes, to blind him quite;\r\nafter which I clove his head, and turned, uninjured, to see how my\r\nbrothers had fared. Both the giants were down, but so were my brothers.\r\nI flew first to the one and then to the other couple. Both pairs of\r\ncombatants were dead, and yet locked together, as in the\r\ndeath-struggle. The elder had buried his battle-axe in the body of his\r\nfoe, and had fallen beneath him as he fell. The giant had strangled him\r\nin his own death-agonies. The younger had nearly hewn off the left leg\r\nof his enemy; and, grappled with in the act, had, while they rolled\r\ntogether on the earth, found for his dagger a passage betwixt the\r\ngorget and cuirass of the giant, and stabbed him mortally in the\r\nthroat. The blood from the giant\xe2\x80\x99s throat was yet pouring over the hand\r\nof his foe, which still grasped the hilt of the dagger sheathed in the\r\nwound. They lay silent. I, the least worthy, remained the sole survivor\r\nin the lists.\r\n\r\nAs I stood exhausted amidst the dead, after the first worthy deed of my\r\nlife, I suddenly looked behind me, and there lay the Shadow, black in\r\nthe sunshine. I went into the lonely tower, and there lay the useless\r\narmour of the noble youths\xe2\x80\x94supine as they.\r\n\r\nAh, how sad it looked! It was a glorious death, but it was death. My\r\nsongs could not comfort me now. I was almost ashamed that I was alive,\r\nwhen they, the true-hearted, were no more. And yet I breathed freer to\r\nthink that I had gone through the trial, and had not failed. And\r\nperhaps I may be forgiven, if some feelings of pride arose in my bosom,\r\nwhen I looked down on the mighty form that lay dead by my hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter all, however,\xe2\x80\x9d I said to myself, and my heart sank, \xe2\x80\x9cit was only\r\nskill. Your giant was but a blunderer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI left the bodies of friends and foes, peaceful enough when the\r\ndeath-fight was over, and, hastening to the country below, roused the\r\npeasants. They came with shouting and gladness, bringing waggons to\r\ncarry the bodies. I resolved to take the princes home to their father,\r\neach as he lay, in the arms of his country\xe2\x80\x99s foe. But first I searched\r\nthe giants, and found the keys of their castle, to which I repaired,\r\nfollowed by a great company of the people. It was a place of wonderful\r\nstrength. I released the prisoners, knights and ladies, all in a sad\r\ncondition, from the cruelties and neglects of the giants. It humbled me\r\nto see them crowding round me with thanks, when in truth the glorious\r\nbrothers, lying dead by their lonely tower, were those to whom the\r\nthanks belonged. I had but aided in carrying out the thought born in\r\ntheir brain, and uttered in visible form before ever I laid hold\r\nthereupon. Yet I did count myself happy to have been chosen for their\r\nbrother in this great deed.\r\n\r\nAfter a few hours spent in refreshing and clothing the prisoners, we\r\nall commenced our journey towards the capital. This was slow at first;\r\nbut, as the strength and spirits of the prisoners returned, it became\r\nmore rapid; and in three days we reached the palace of the king. As we\r\nentered the city gates, with the huge bulks lying each on a waggon\r\ndrawn by horses, and two of them inextricably intertwined with the dead\r\nbodies of their princes, the people raised a shout and then a cry, and\r\nfollowed in multitudes the solemn procession.\r\n\r\nI will not attempt to describe the behaviour of the grand old king. Joy\r\nand pride in his sons overcame his sorrow at their loss. On me he\r\nheaped every kindness that heart could devise or hand execute. He used\r\nto sit and question me, night after night, about everything that was in\r\nany way connected with them and their preparations. Our mode of life,\r\nand relation to each other, during the time we spent together, was a\r\nconstant theme. He entered into the minutest details of the\r\nconstruction of the armour, even to a peculiar mode of riveting some of\r\nthe plates, with unwearying interest. This armour I had intended to beg\r\nof the king, as my sole memorials of the contest; but, when I saw the\r\ndelight he took in contemplating it, and the consolation it appeared to\r\nafford him in his sorrow, I could not ask for it; but, at his request,\r\nleft my own, weapons and all, to be joined with theirs in a trophy,\r\nerected in the grand square of the palace. The king, with gorgeous\r\nceremony, dubbed me knight with his own old hand, in which trembled the\r\nsword of his youth.\r\n\r\nDuring the short time I remained, my company was, naturally, much\r\ncourted by the young nobles. I was in a constant round of gaiety and\r\ndiversion, notwithstanding that the court was in mourning. For the\r\ncountry was so rejoiced at the death of the giants, and so many of\r\ntheir lost friends had been restored to the nobility and men of wealth,\r\nthat the gladness surpassed the grief. \xe2\x80\x9cYe have indeed left your lives\r\nto your people, my great brothers!\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\nBut I was ever and ever haunted by the old shadow, which I had not seen\r\nall the time that I was at work in the tower. Even in the society of\r\nthe ladies of the court, who seemed to think it only their duty to make\r\nmy stay there as pleasant to me as possible, I could not help being\r\nconscious of its presence, although it might not be annoying me at the\r\ntime. At length, somewhat weary of uninterrupted pleasure, and nowise\r\nstrengthened thereby, either in body or mind, I put on a splendid suit\r\nof armour of steel inlaid with silver, which the old king had given me,\r\nand, mounting the horse on which it had been brought to me, took my\r\nleave of the palace, to visit the distant city in which the lady dwelt,\r\nwhom the elder prince had loved. I anticipated a sore task, in\r\nconveying to her the news of his glorious fate: but this trial was\r\nspared me, in a manner as strange as anything that had happened to me\r\nin Fairy Land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo one has my form but the _I_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n          _Schoppe_, in JEAN PAUL\xe2\x80\x99S _Titan_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJoy\xe2\x80\x99s a subtil elf.\r\nI think man\xe2\x80\x99s happiest when he forgets himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n          CYRIL TOURNEUR, _The Revenger\xe2\x80\x99s Tragedy_.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the third day of my journey, I was riding gently along a road,\r\napparently little frequented, to judge from the grass that grew upon\r\nit. I was approaching a forest. Everywhere in Fairy Land forests are\r\nthe places where one may most certainly expect adventures. As I drew\r\nnear, a youth, unarmed, gentle, and beautiful, who had just cut a\r\nbranch from a yew growing on the skirts of the wood, evidently to make\r\nhimself a bow, met me, and thus accosted me:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir knight, be careful as thou ridest through this forest; for it is\r\nsaid to be strangely enchanted, in a sort which even those who have\r\nbeen witnesses of its enchantment can hardly describe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI thanked him for his advice, which I promised to follow, and rode on.\r\nBut the moment I entered the wood, it seemed to me that, if enchantment\r\nthere was, it must be of a good kind; for the Shadow, which had been\r\nmore than usually dark and distressing, since I had set out on this\r\njourney, suddenly disappeared. I felt a wonderful elevation of spirits,\r\nand began to reflect on my past life, and especially on my combat with\r\nthe giants, with such satisfaction, that I had actually to remind\r\nmyself, that I had only killed one of them; and that, but for the\r\nbrothers, I should never have had the idea of attacking them, not to\r\nmention the smallest power of standing to it. Still I rejoiced, and\r\ncounted myself amongst the glorious knights of old; having even the\r\nunspeakable presumption\xe2\x80\x94my shame and self-condemnation at the memory of\r\nit are such, that I write it as the only and sorest penance I can\r\nperform\xe2\x80\x94to think of myself (will the world believe it?) as side by side\r\nwith Sir Galahad! Scarcely had the thought been born in my mind, when,\r\napproaching me from the left, through the trees, I espied a resplendent\r\nknight, of mighty size, whose armour seemed to shine of itself, without\r\nthe sun. When he drew near, I was astonished to see that this armour\r\nwas like my own; nay, I could trace, line for line, the correspondence\r\nof the inlaid silver to the device on my own. His horse, too, was like\r\nmine in colour, form, and motion; save that, like his rider, he was\r\ngreater and fiercer than his counterpart. The knight rode with beaver\r\nup. As he halted right opposite to me in the narrow path, barring my\r\nway, I saw the reflection of my countenance in the centre plate of\r\nshining steel on his breastplate. Above it rose the same face\xe2\x80\x94his\r\nface\xe2\x80\x94only, as I have said, larger and fiercer. I was bewildered. I\r\ncould not help feeling some admiration of him, but it was mingled with\r\na dim conviction that he was evil, and that I ought to fight with him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me pass,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I will,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied.\r\n\r\nSomething within me said: \xe2\x80\x9cSpear in rest, and ride at him! else thou\r\nart for ever a slave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI tried, but my arm trembled so much, that I could not couch my lance.\r\nTo tell the truth, I, who had overcome the giant, shook like a coward\r\nbefore this knight. He gave a scornful laugh, that echoed through the\r\nwood, turned his horse, and said, without looking round, \xe2\x80\x9cFollow me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI obeyed, abashed and stupefied. How long he led, and how long I\r\nfollowed, I cannot tell. \xe2\x80\x9cI never knew misery before,\xe2\x80\x9d I said to\r\nmyself. \xe2\x80\x9cWould that I had at least struck him, and had had my\r\ndeath-blow in return! Why, then, do I not call to him to wheel and\r\ndefend himself? Alas! I know not why, but I cannot. One look from him\r\nwould cow me like a beaten hound.\xe2\x80\x9d I followed, and was silent.\r\n\r\nAt length we came to a dreary square tower, in the middle of a dense\r\nforest. It looked as if scarce a tree had been cut down to make room\r\nfor it. Across the very door, diagonally, grew the stem of a tree, so\r\nlarge that there was just room to squeeze past it in order to enter.\r\nOne miserable square hole in the roof was the only visible suggestion\r\nof a window. Turret or battlement, or projecting masonry of any kind,\r\nit had none. Clear and smooth and massy, it rose from its base, and\r\nended with a line straight and unbroken. The roof, carried to a centre\r\nfrom each of the four walls, rose slightly to the point where the\r\nrafters met. Round the base lay several little heaps of either bits of\r\nbroken branches, withered and peeled, or half-whitened bones; I could\r\nnot distinguish which. As I approached, the ground sounded hollow\r\nbeneath my horse\xe2\x80\x99s hoofs. The knight took a great key from his pocket,\r\nand reaching past the stem of the tree, with some difficulty opened the\r\ndoor. \xe2\x80\x9cDismount,\xe2\x80\x9d he commanded. I obeyed. He turned my horse\xe2\x80\x99s head\r\naway from the tower, gave him a terrible blow with the flat side of his\r\nsword, and sent him madly tearing through the forest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9center, and take your companion with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI looked round: knight and horse had vanished, and behind me lay the\r\nhorrible shadow. I entered, for I could not help myself; and the shadow\r\nfollowed me. I had a terrible conviction that the knight and he were\r\none. The door closed behind me.\r\n\r\nNow I was indeed in pitiful plight. There was literally nothing in the\r\ntower but my shadow and me. The walls rose right up to the roof; in\r\nwhich, as I had seen from without, there was one little square opening.\r\nThis I now knew to be the only window the tower possessed. I sat down\r\non the floor, in listless wretchedness. I think I must have fallen\r\nasleep, and have slept for hours; for I suddenly became aware of\r\nexistence, in observing that the moon was shining through the hole in\r\nthe roof. As she rose higher and higher, her light crept down the wall\r\nover me, till at last it shone right upon my head. Instantaneously the\r\nwalls of the tower seemed to vanish away like a mist. I sat beneath a\r\nbeech, on the edge of a forest, and the open country lay, in the\r\nmoonlight, for miles and miles around me, spotted with glimmering\r\nhouses and spires and towers. I thought with myself, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, joy! it was\r\nonly a dream; the horrible narrow waste is gone, and I wake beneath a\r\nbeech-tree, perhaps one that loves me, and I can go where I will.\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nrose, as I thought, and walked about, and did what I would, but ever\r\nkept near the tree; for always, and, of course, since my meeting with\r\nthe woman of the beech-tree far more than ever, I loved that tree. So\r\nthe night wore on. I waited for the sun to rise, before I could venture\r\nto renew my journey. But as soon as the first faint light of the dawn\r\nappeared, instead of shining upon me from the eye of the morning, it\r\nstole like a fainting ghost through the little square hole above my\r\nhead; and the walls came out as the light grew, and the glorious night\r\nwas swallowed up of the hateful day. The long dreary day passed. My\r\nshadow lay black on the floor. I felt no hunger, no need of food. The\r\nnight came. The moon shone. I watched her light slowly descending the\r\nwall, as I might have watched, adown the sky, the long, swift approach\r\nof a helping angel. Her rays touched me, and I was free. Thus night\r\nafter night passed away. I should have died but for this. Every night\r\nthe conviction returned, that I was free. Every morning I sat\r\nwretchedly disconsolate. At length, when the course of the moon no\r\nlonger permitted her beams to touch me, the night was dreary as the\r\nday.\r\n\r\nWhen I slept, I was somewhat consoled by my dreams; but all the time I\r\ndreamed, I knew that I was only dreaming. But one night, at length, the\r\nmoon, a mere shred of pallor, scattered a few thin ghostly rays upon\r\nme; and I think I fell asleep and dreamed. I sat in an autumn night\r\nbefore the vintage, on a hill overlooking my own castle. My heart\r\nsprang with joy. Oh, to be a child again, innocent, fearless, without\r\nshame or desire! I walked down to the castle. All were in consternation\r\nat my absence. My sisters were weeping for my loss. They sprang up and\r\nclung to me, with incoherent cries, as I entered. My old friends came\r\nflocking round me. A gray light shone on the roof of the hall. It was\r\nthe light of the dawn shining through the square window of my tower.\r\nMore earnestly than ever, I longed for freedom after this dream; more\r\ndrearily than ever, crept on the next wretched day. I measured by the\r\nsunbeams, caught through the little window in the trap of my tower, how\r\nit went by, waiting only for the dreams of the night.\r\n\r\nAbout noon, I started as if something foreign to all my senses and all\r\nmy experience, had suddenly invaded me; yet it was only the voice of a\r\nwoman singing. My whole frame quivered with joy, surprise, and the\r\nsensation of the unforeseen. Like a living soul, like an incarnation of\r\nNature, the song entered my prison-house. Each tone folded its wings,\r\nand laid itself, like a caressing bird, upon my heart. It bathed me\r\nlike a sea; inwrapt me like an odorous vapour; entered my soul like a\r\nlong draught of clear spring-water; shone upon me like essential\r\nsunlight; soothed me like a mother\xe2\x80\x99s voice and hand. Yet, as the\r\nclearest forest-well tastes sometimes of the bitterness of decayed\r\nleaves, so to my weary, prisoned heart, its cheerfulness had a sting of\r\ncold, and its tenderness unmanned me with the faintness of\r\nlong-departed joys. I wept half-bitterly, half-luxuriously; but not\r\nlong. I dashed away the tears, ashamed of a weakness which I thought I\r\nhad abandoned. Ere I knew, I had walked to the door, and seated myself\r\nwith my ears against it, in order to catch every syllable of the\r\nrevelation from the unseen outer world. And now I heard each word\r\ndistinctly. The singer seemed to be standing or sitting near the tower,\r\nfor the sounds indicated no change of place. The song was something\r\nlike this:\r\n\r\nThe sun, like a golden knot on high,\r\nGathers the glories of the sky,\r\nAnd binds them into a shining tent,\r\nRoofing the world with the firmament.\r\nAnd through the pavilion the rich winds blow,\r\nAnd through the pavilion the waters go.\r\nAnd the birds for joy, and the trees for prayer,\r\nBowing their heads in the sunny air,\r\nAnd for thoughts, the gently talking springs,\r\nThat come from the centre with secret things\xe2\x80\x94\r\nAll make a music, gentle and strong,\r\nBound by the heart into one sweet song.\r\nAnd amidst them all, the mother Earth\r\nSits with the children of her birth;\r\nShe tendeth them all, as a mother hen\r\nHer little ones round her, twelve or ten:\r\nOft she sitteth, with hands on knee,\r\nIdle with love for her family.\r\nGo forth to her from the dark and the dust,\r\nAnd weep beside her, if weep thou must;\r\nIf she may not hold thee to her breast,\r\nLike a weary infant, that cries for rest\r\nAt least she will press thee to her knee,\r\nAnd tell a low, sweet tale to thee,\r\nTill the hue to thy cheeky and the light to thine eye,\r\nStrength to thy limbs, and courage high\r\nTo thy fainting heart, return amain,\r\nAnd away to work thou goest again.\r\nFrom the narrow desert, O man of pride,\r\nCome into the house, so high and wide.\r\n\r\n\r\nHardly knowing what I did, I opened the door. Why had I not done so\r\nbefore? I do not know.\r\n\r\nAt first I could see no one; but when I had forced myself past the tree\r\nwhich grew across the entrance, I saw, seated on the ground, and\r\nleaning against the tree, with her back to my prison, a beautiful\r\nwoman. Her countenance seemed known to me, and yet unknown. She looked\r\nat me and smiled, when I made my appearance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! were you the prisoner there? I am very glad I have wiled you out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know me then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you not know me? But you hurt me, and that, I suppose, makes it\r\neasy for a man to forget. You broke my globe. Yet I thank you. Perhaps\r\nI owe you many thanks for breaking it. I took the pieces, all black,\r\nand wet with crying over them, to the Fairy Queen. There was no music\r\nand no light in them now. But she took them from me, and laid them\r\naside; and made me go to sleep in a great hall of white, with black\r\npillars, and many red curtains. When I woke in the morning, I went to\r\nher, hoping to have my globe again, whole and sound; but she sent me\r\naway without it, and I have not seen it since. Nor do I care for it\r\nnow. I have something so much better. I do not need the globe to play\r\nto me; for I can sing. I could not sing at all before. Now I go about\r\neverywhere through Fairy Land, singing till my heart is like to break,\r\njust like my globe, for very joy at my own songs. And wherever I go, my\r\nsongs do good, and deliver people. And now I have delivered you, and I\r\nam so happy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe ceased, and the tears came into her eyes.\r\n\r\nAll this time, I had been gazing at her; and now fully recognised the\r\nface of the child, glorified in the countenance of the woman.\r\n\r\nI was ashamed and humbled before her; but a great weight was lifted\r\nfrom my thoughts. I knelt before her, and thanked her, and begged her\r\nto forgive me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRise, rise,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cI have nothing to forgive; I thank you. But\r\nnow I must be gone, for I do not know how many may be waiting for me,\r\nhere and there, through the dark forests; and they cannot come out till\r\nI come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe rose, and with a smile and a farewell, turned and left me. I dared\r\nnot ask her to stay; in fact, I could hardly speak to her. Between her\r\nand me, there was a great gulf. She was uplifted, by sorrow and\r\nwell-doing, into a region I could hardly hope ever to enter. I watched\r\nher departure, as one watches a sunset. She went like a radiance\r\nthrough the dark wood, which was henceforth bright to me, from simply\r\nknowing that such a creature was in it.\r\n\r\nShe was bearing the sun to the unsunned spots. The light and the music\r\nof her broken globe were now in her heart and her brain. As she went,\r\nshe sang; and I caught these few words of her song; and the tones\r\nseemed to linger and wind about the trees after she had disappeared:\r\n\r\nThou goest thine, and I go mine\xe2\x80\x94\r\n    Many ways we wend;\r\nMany days, and many ways,\r\n    Ending in one end.\r\n\r\nMany a wrong, and its curing song;\r\n    Many a road, and many an inn;\r\nRoom to roam, but only one home\r\n    For all the world to win.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd so she vanished. With a sad heart, soothed by humility, and the\r\nknowledge of her peace and gladness, I bethought me what now I should\r\ndo. First, I must leave the tower far behind me, lest, in some evil\r\nmoment, I might be once more caged within its horrible walls. But it\r\nwas ill walking in my heavy armour; and besides I had now no right to\r\nthe golden spurs and the resplendent mail, fitly dulled with long\r\nneglect. I might do for a squire; but I honoured knighthood too highly,\r\nto call myself any longer one of the noble brotherhood. I stripped off\r\nall my armour, piled it under the tree, just where the lady had been\r\nseated, and took my unknown way, eastward through the woods. Of all my\r\nweapons, I carried only a short axe in my hand.\r\n\r\nThen first I knew the delight of being lowly; of saying to myself, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nam what I am, nothing more.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI have failed,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cI have lost\r\nmyself\xe2\x80\x94would it had been my shadow.\xe2\x80\x9d I looked round: the shadow was\r\nnowhere to be seen. Ere long, I learned that it was not myself, but\r\nonly my shadow, that I had lost. I learned that it is better, a\r\nthousand-fold, for a proud man to fall and be humbled, than to hold up\r\nhis head in his pride and fancied innocence. I learned that he that\r\nwill be a hero, will barely be a man; that he that will be nothing but\r\na doer of his work, is sure of his manhood. In nothing was my ideal\r\nlowered, or dimmed, or grown less precious; I only saw it too plainly,\r\nto set myself for a moment beside it. Indeed, my ideal soon became my\r\nlife; whereas, formerly, my life had consisted in a vain attempt to\r\nbehold, if not my ideal in myself, at least myself in my ideal. Now,\r\nhowever, I took, at first, what perhaps was a mistaken pleasure, in\r\ndespising and degrading myself. Another self seemed to arise, like a\r\nwhite spirit from a dead man, from the dumb and trampled self of the\r\npast. Doubtless, this self must again die and be buried, and again,\r\nfrom its tomb, spring a winged child; but of this my history as yet\r\nbears not the record.\r\n\r\nSelf will come to life even in the slaying of self; but there is ever\r\nsomething deeper and stronger than it, which will emerge at last from\r\nthe unknown abysses of the soul: will it be as a solemn gloom, burning\r\nwith eyes? or a clear morning after the rain? or a smiling child, that\r\nfinds itself nowhere, and everywhere?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHigh erected thought, seated in a heart of courtesy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n          SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA sweet attractive kinde of grace,\r\n    A full assurance given by lookes,\r\nContinuall comfort in a face,\r\n    The lineaments of Gospel bookes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n          MATTHEW ROYDON, on Sir Philip Sidney.\r\n\r\n\r\nI had not gone far, for I had but just lost sight of the hated tower,\r\nwhen a voice of another sort, sounding near or far, as the trees\r\npermitted or intercepted its passage, reached me. It was a full, deep,\r\nmanly voice, but withal clear and melodious. Now it burst on the ear\r\nwith a sudden swell, and anon, dying away as suddenly, seemed to come\r\nto me across a great space. Nevertheless, it drew nearer; till, at\r\nlast, I could distinguish the words of the song, and get transient\r\nglimpses of the singer, between the columns of the trees. He came\r\nnearer, dawning upon me like a growing thought. He was a knight, armed\r\nfrom head to heel, mounted upon a strange-looking beast, whose form I\r\ncould not understand. The words which I heard him sing were like these:\r\n\r\nHeart be stout,\r\n    And eye be true;\r\nGood blade out!\r\n    And ill shall rue.\r\n\r\nCourage, horse!\r\n    Thou lackst no skill;\r\nWell thy force\r\n    Hath matched my will.\r\n\r\nFor the foe\r\n    With fiery breath,\r\nAt a blow,\r\n    Is still in death.\r\n\r\nGently, horse!\r\n    Tread fearlessly;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tis his corse\r\n    That burdens thee.\r\n\r\nThe sun\xe2\x80\x99s eye\r\n    Is fierce at noon;\r\nThou and I\r\n    Will rest full soon.\r\n\r\nAnd new strength\r\n    New work will meet;\r\nTill, at length,\r\n    Long rest is sweet.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now horse and rider had arrived near enough for me to see, fastened\r\nby the long neck to the hinder part of the saddle, and trailing its\r\nhideous length on the ground behind, the body of a great dragon. It was\r\nno wonder that, with such a drag at his heels, the horse could make but\r\nslow progress, notwithstanding his evident dismay. The horrid,\r\nserpent-like head, with its black tongue, forked with red, hanging out\r\nof its jaws, dangled against the horse\xe2\x80\x99s side. Its neck was covered\r\nwith long blue hair, its sides with scales of green and gold. Its back\r\nwas of corrugated skin, of a purple hue. Its belly was similar in\r\nnature, but its colour was leaden, dashed with blotches of livid blue.\r\nIts skinny, bat-like wings and its tail were of a dull gray. It was\r\nstrange to see how so many gorgeous colours, so many curving lines, and\r\nsuch beautiful things as wings and hair and scales, combined to form\r\nthe horrible creature, intense in ugliness.\r\n\r\nThe knight was passing me with a salutation; but, as I walked towards\r\nhim, he reined up, and I stood by his stirrup. When I came near him, I\r\nsaw to my surprise and pleasure likewise, although a sudden pain, like\r\na birth of fire, sprang up in my heart, that it was the knight of the\r\nsoiled armour, whom I knew before, and whom I had seen in the vision,\r\nwith the lady of the marble. But I could have thrown my arms around\r\nhim, because she loved him. This discovery only strengthened the\r\nresolution I had formed, before I recognised him, of offering myself to\r\nthe knight, to wait upon him as a squire, for he seemed to be\r\nunattended. I made my request in as few words as possible. He hesitated\r\nfor a moment, and looked at me thoughtfully. I saw that he suspected\r\nwho I was, but that he continued uncertain of his suspicion. No doubt\r\nhe was soon convinced of its truth; but all the time I was with him,\r\nnot a word crossed his lips with reference to what he evidently\r\nconcluded I wished to leave unnoticed, if not to keep concealed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSquire and knight should be friends,\xe2\x80\x9d said he: \xe2\x80\x9ccan you take me by the\r\nhand?\xe2\x80\x9d And he held out the great gauntleted right hand. I grasped it\r\nwillingly and strongly. Not a word more was said. The knight gave the\r\nsign to his horse, which again began his slow march, and I walked\r\nbeside and a little behind.\r\n\r\nWe had not gone very far before we arrived at a little cottage; from\r\nwhich, as we drew near, a woman rushed out with the cry:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy child! my child! have you found my child?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have found her,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the knight, \xe2\x80\x9cbut she is sorely hurt. I was\r\nforced to leave her with the hermit, as I returned. You will find her\r\nthere, and I think she will get better. You see I have brought you a\r\npresent. This wretch will not hurt you again.\xe2\x80\x9d And he undid the\r\ncreature\xe2\x80\x99s neck, and flung the frightful burden down by the cottage\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nThe woman was now almost out of sight in the wood; but the husband\r\nstood at the door, with speechless thanks in his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must bury the monster,\xe2\x80\x9d said the knight. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I had arrived a\r\nmoment later, I should have been too late. But now you need not fear,\r\nfor such a creature as this very rarely appears, in the same part,\r\ntwice during a lifetime.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you not dismount and rest you, Sir Knight?\xe2\x80\x9d said the peasant, who\r\nhad, by this time, recovered himself a little.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I will, thankfully,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; and, dismounting, he gave the reins\r\nto me, and told me to unbridle the horse, and lead him into the shade.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou need not tie him up,\xe2\x80\x9d he added; \xe2\x80\x9che will not run away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen I returned, after obeying his orders, and entered the cottage, I\r\nsaw the knight seated, without his helmet, and talking most familiarly\r\nwith the simple host. I stood at the open door for a moment, and,\r\ngazing at him, inwardly justified the white lady in preferring him to\r\nme. A nobler countenance I never saw. Loving-kindness beamed from every\r\nline of his face. It seemed as if he would repay himself for the late\r\narduous combat, by indulging in all the gentleness of a womanly heart.\r\nBut when the talk ceased for a moment, he seemed to fall into a\r\nreverie. Then the exquisite curves of the upper lip vanished. The lip\r\nwas lengthened and compressed at the same moment. You could have told\r\nthat, within the lips, the teeth were firmly closed. The whole face\r\ngrew stern and determined, all but fierce; only the eyes burned on like\r\na holy sacrifice, uplift on a granite rock.\r\n\r\nThe woman entered, with her mangled child in her arms. She was pale as\r\nher little burden. She gazed, with a wild love and despairing\r\ntenderness, on the still, all but dead face, white and clear from loss\r\nof blood and terror.\r\n\r\nThe knight rose. The light that had been confined to his eyes, now\r\nshone from his whole countenance. He took the little thing in his arms,\r\nand, with the mother\xe2\x80\x99s help, undressed her, and looked to her wounds.\r\nThe tears flowed down his face as he did so. With tender hands he bound\r\nthem up, kissed the pale cheek, and gave her back to her mother. When\r\nhe went home, all his tale would be of the grief and joy of the\r\nparents; while to me, who had looked on, the gracious countenance of\r\nthe armed man, beaming from the panoply of steel, over the seemingly\r\ndead child, while the powerful hands turned it and shifted it, and\r\nbound it, if possible even more gently than the mother\xe2\x80\x99s, formed the\r\ncentre of the story.\r\n\r\nAfter we had partaken of the best they could give us, the knight took\r\nhis leave, with a few parting instructions to the mother as to how she\r\nshould treat the child.\r\n\r\nI brought the knight his steed, held the stirrup while he mounted, and\r\nthen followed him through the wood. The horse, delighted to be free of\r\nhis hideous load, bounded beneath the weight of man and armour, and\r\ncould hardly be restrained from galloping on. But the knight made him\r\ntime his powers to mine, and so we went on for an hour or two. Then the\r\nknight dismounted, and compelled me to get into the saddle, saying:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKnight and squire must share the labour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHolding by the stirrup, he walked along by my side, heavily clad as he\r\nwas, with apparent ease. As we went, he led a conversation, in which I\r\ntook what humble part my sense of my condition would permit me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomehow or other,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cnotwithstanding the beauty of this\r\ncountry of Faerie, in which we are, there is much that is wrong in it.\r\nIf there are great splendours, there are corresponding horrors; heights\r\nand depths; beautiful women and awful fiends; noble men and weaklings.\r\nAll a man has to do, is to better what he can. And if he will settle it\r\nwith himself, that even renown and success are in themselves of no\r\ngreat value, and be content to be defeated, if so be that the fault is\r\nnot his; and so go to his work with a cool brain and a strong will, he\r\nwill get it done; and fare none the worse in the end, that he was not\r\nburdened with provision and precaution.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he will not always come off well,\xe2\x80\x9d I ventured to say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps not,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the knight, \xe2\x80\x9cin the individual act; but the\r\nresult of his lifetime will content him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo it will fare with you, doubtless,\xe2\x80\x9d thought I; \xe2\x80\x9cbut for me\xe2\x80\x94-\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVenturing to resume the conversation after a pause, I said,\r\nhesitatingly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I ask for what the little beggar-girl wanted your aid, when she\r\ncame to your castle to find you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at me for a moment in silence, and then said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot help wondering how you know of that; but there is something\r\nabout you quite strange enough to entitle you to the privilege of the\r\ncountry; namely, to go unquestioned. I, however, being only a man, such\r\nas you see me, am ready to tell you anything you like to ask me, as far\r\nas I can. The little beggar-girl came into the hall where I was\r\nsitting, and told me a very curious story, which I can only recollect\r\nvery vaguely, it was so peculiar. What I can recall is, that she was\r\nsent to gather wings. As soon as she had gathered a pair of wings for\r\nherself, she was to fly away, she said, to the country she came from;\r\nbut where that was, she could give no information.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe said she had to beg her wings from the butterflies and moths; and\r\nwherever she begged, no one refused her. But she needed a great many of\r\nthe wings of butterflies and moths to make a pair for her; and so she\r\nhad to wander about day after day, looking for butterflies, and night\r\nafter night, looking for moths; and then she begged for their wings.\r\nBut the day before, she had come into a part of the forest, she said,\r\nwhere there were multitudes of splendid butterflies flitting about,\r\nwith wings which were just fit to make the eyes in the shoulders of\r\nhers; and she knew she could have as many of them as she liked for the\r\nasking; but as soon as she began to beg, there came a great creature\r\nright up to her, and threw her down, and walked over her. When she got\r\nup, she saw the wood was full of these beings stalking about, and\r\nseeming to have nothing to do with each other. As soon as ever she\r\nbegan to beg, one of them walked over her; till at last in dismay, and\r\nin growing horror of the senseless creatures, she had run away to look\r\nfor somebody to help her. I asked her what they were like. She said,\r\nlike great men, made of wood, without knee-or elbow-joints, and without\r\nany noses or mouths or eyes in their faces. I laughed at the little\r\nmaiden, thinking she was making child\xe2\x80\x99s game of me; but, although she\r\nburst out laughing too, she persisted in asserting the truth of her\r\nstory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Only come, knight, come and see; I will lead you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I armed myself, to be ready for anything that might happen, and\r\nfollowed the child; for, though I could make nothing of her story, I\r\ncould see she was a little human being in need of some help or other.\r\nAs she walked before me, I looked attentively at her. Whether or not it\r\nwas from being so often knocked down and walked over, I could not tell,\r\nbut her clothes were very much torn, and in several places her white\r\nskin was peeping through. I thought she was hump-backed; but on looking\r\nmore closely, I saw, through the tatters of her frock\xe2\x80\x94do not laugh at\r\nme\xe2\x80\x94a bunch on each shoulder, of the most gorgeous colours. Looking yet\r\nmore closely, I saw that they were of the shape of folded wings, and\r\nwere made of all kinds of butterfly-wings and moth-wings, crowded\r\ntogether like the feathers on the individual butterfly pinion; but,\r\nlike them, most beautifully arranged, and producing a perfect harmony\r\nof colour and shade. I could now more easily believe the rest of her\r\nstory; especially as I saw, every now and then, a certain heaving\r\nmotion in the wings, as if they longed to be uplifted and outspread.\r\nBut beneath her scanty garments complete wings could not be concealed,\r\nand indeed, from her own story, they were yet unfinished.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter walking for two or three hours (how the little girl found her\r\nway, I could not imagine), we came to a part of the forest, the very\r\nair of which was quivering with the motions of multitudes of\r\nresplendent butterflies; as gorgeous in colour, as if the eyes of\r\npeacocks\xe2\x80\x99 feathers had taken to flight, but of infinite variety of hue\r\nand form, only that the appearance of some kind of eye on each wing\r\npredominated. \xe2\x80\x98There they are, there they are!\xe2\x80\x99 cried the child, in a\r\ntone of victory mingled with terror. Except for this tone, I should\r\nhave thought she referred to the butterflies, for I could see nothing\r\nelse. But at that moment an enormous butterfly, whose wings had great\r\neyes of blue surrounded by confused cloudy heaps of more dingy\r\ncolouring, just like a break in the clouds on a stormy day towards\r\nevening, settled near us. The child instantly began murmuring:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Butterfly, butterfly, give me your wings\xe2\x80\x99; when, the moment after, she\r\nfell to the ground, and began crying as if hurt. I drew my sword and\r\nheaved a great blow in the direction in which the child had fallen. It\r\nstruck something, and instantly the most grotesque imitation of a man\r\nbecame visible. You see this Fairy Land is full of oddities and all\r\nsorts of incredibly ridiculous things, which a man is compelled to meet\r\nand treat as real existences, although all the time he feels foolish\r\nfor doing so. This being, if being it could be called, was like a block\r\nof wood roughly hewn into the mere outlines of a man; and hardly so,\r\nfor it had but head, body, legs, and arms\xe2\x80\x94the head without a face, and\r\nthe limbs utterly formless. I had hewn off one of its legs, but the two\r\nportions moved on as best they could, quite independent of each other;\r\nso that I had done no good. I ran after it, and clove it in twain from\r\nthe head downwards; but it could not be convinced that its vocation was\r\nnot to walk over people; for, as soon as the little girl began her\r\nbegging again, all three parts came bustling up; and if I had not\r\ninterposed my weight between her and them, she would have been trampled\r\nagain under them. I saw that something else must be done. If the wood\r\nwas full of the creatures, it would be an endless work to chop them so\r\nsmall that they could do no injury; and then, besides, the parts would\r\nbe so numerous, that the butterflies would be in danger from the drift\r\nof flying chips. I served this one so, however; and then told the girl\r\nto beg again, and point out the direction in which one was coming. I\r\nwas glad to find, however, that I could now see him myself, and\r\nwondered how they could have been invisible before. I would not allow\r\nhim to walk over the child; but while I kept him off, and she began\r\nbegging again, another appeared; and it was all I could do, from the\r\nweight of my armour, to protect her from the stupid, persevering\r\nefforts of the two. But suddenly the right plan occurred to me. I\r\ntripped one of them up, and, taking him by the legs, set him up on his\r\nhead, with his heels against a tree. I was delighted to find he could\r\nnot move. Meantime the poor child was walked over by the other, but it\r\nwas for the last time. Whenever one appeared, I followed the same\r\nplan\xe2\x80\x94tripped him up and set him on his head; and so the little beggar\r\nwas able to gather her wings without any trouble, which occupation she\r\ncontinued for several hours in my company.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat became of her?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI took her home with me to my castle, and she told me all her story;\r\nbut it seemed to me, all the time, as if I were hearing a child talk in\r\nits sleep. I could not arrange her story in my mind at all, although it\r\nseemed to leave hers in some certain order of its own. My wife\xe2\x80\x94-\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere the knight checked himself, and said no more. Neither did I urge\r\nthe conversation farther.\r\n\r\nThus we journeyed for several days, resting at night in such shelter as\r\nwe could get; and when no better was to be had, lying in the forest\r\nunder some tree, on a couch of old leaves.\r\n\r\nI loved the knight more and more. I believe never squire served his\r\nmaster with more care and joyfulness than I. I tended his horse; I\r\ncleaned his armour; my skill in the craft enabled me to repair it when\r\nnecessary; I watched his needs; and was well repaid for all by the love\r\nitself which I bore him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis,\xe2\x80\x9d I said to myself, \xe2\x80\x9cis a true man. I will serve him, and give\r\nhim all worship, seeing in him the imbodiment of what I would fain\r\nbecome. If I cannot be noble myself, I will yet be servant to his\r\nnobleness.\xe2\x80\x9d He, in return, soon showed me such signs of friendship and\r\nrespect, as made my heart glad; and I felt that, after all, mine would\r\nbe no lost life, if I might wait on him to the world\xe2\x80\x99s end, although no\r\nsmile but his should greet me, and no one but him should say, \xe2\x80\x9cWell\r\ndone! he was a good servant!\xe2\x80\x9d at last. But I burned to do something\r\nmore for him than the ordinary routine of a squire\xe2\x80\x99s duty permitted.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon, we began to observe an appearance of roads in the wood.\r\nBranches had been cut down, and openings made, where footsteps had worn\r\nno path below. These indications increased as we passed on, till, at\r\nlength, we came into a long, narrow avenue, formed by felling the trees\r\nin its line, as the remaining roots evidenced. At some little distance,\r\non both hands, we observed signs of similar avenues, which appeared to\r\nconverge with ours, towards one spot. Along these we indistinctly saw\r\nseveral forms moving, which seemed, with ourselves, to approach the\r\ncommon centre. Our path brought us, at last, up to a wall of yew-trees,\r\ngrowing close together, and intertwining their branches so, that\r\nnothing could be seen beyond it. An opening was cut in it like a door,\r\nand all the wall was trimmed smooth and perpendicular. The knight\r\ndismounted, and waited till I had provided for his horse\xe2\x80\x99s comfort;\r\nupon which we entered the place together.\r\n\r\nIt was a great space, bare of trees, and enclosed by four walls of yew,\r\nsimilar to that through which we had entered. These trees grew to a\r\nvery great height, and did not divide from each other till close to the\r\ntop, where their summits formed a row of conical battlements all around\r\nthe walls. The space contained was a parallelogram of great length.\r\nAlong each of the two longer sides of the interior, were ranged three\r\nranks of men, in white robes, standing silent and solemn, each with a\r\nsword by his side, although the rest of his costume and bearing was\r\nmore priestly than soldierly. For some distance inwards, the space\r\nbetween these opposite rows was filled with a company of men and women\r\nand children, in holiday attire. The looks of all were directed\r\ninwards, towards the further end. Far beyond the crowd, in a long\r\navenue, seeming to narrow in the distance, went the long rows of the\r\nwhite-robed men. On what the attention of the multitude was fixed, we\r\ncould not tell, for the sun had set before we arrived, and it was\r\ngrowing dark within. It grew darker and darker. The multitude waited in\r\nsilence. The stars began to shine down into the enclosure, and they\r\ngrew brighter and larger every moment. A wind arose, and swayed the\r\npinnacles of the tree-tops; and made a strange sound, half like music,\r\nhalf like moaning, through the close branches and leaves of the\r\ntree-walls. A young girl who stood beside me, clothed in the same dress\r\nas the priests, bowed her head, and grew pale with awe.\r\n\r\nThe knight whispered to me, \xe2\x80\x9cHow solemn it is! Surely they wait to hear\r\nthe voice of a prophet. There is something good near!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut I, though somewhat shaken by the feeling expressed by my master,\r\nyet had an unaccountable conviction that here was something bad. So I\r\nresolved to be keenly on the watch for what should follow.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a great star, like a sun, appeared high in the air over the\r\ntemple, illuminating it throughout; and a great song arose from the men\r\nin white, which went rolling round and round the building, now receding\r\nto the end, and now approaching, down the other side, the place where\r\nwe stood. For some of the singers were regularly ceasing, and the next\r\nto them as regularly taking up the song, so that it crept onwards with\r\ngradations produced by changes which could not themselves be detected,\r\nfor only a few of those who were singing ceased at the same moment. The\r\nsong paused; and I saw a company of six of the white-robed men walk up\r\nthe centre of the human avenue, surrounding a youth gorgeously attired\r\nbeneath his robe of white, and wearing a chaplet of flowers on his\r\nhead. I followed them closely, with my keenest observation; and, by\r\naccompanying their slow progress with my eyes, I was able to perceive\r\nmore clearly what took place when they arrived at the other end. I knew\r\nthat my sight was so much more keen than that of most people, that I\r\nhad good reason to suppose I should see more than the rest could, at\r\nsuch a distance. At the farther end a throne stood upon a platform,\r\nhigh above the heads of the surrounding priests. To this platform I saw\r\nthe company begin to ascend, apparently by an inclined plane or gentle\r\nslope. The throne itself was elevated again, on a kind of square\r\npedestal, to the top of which led a flight of steps. On the throne sat\r\na majestic-looking figure, whose posture seemed to indicate a mixture\r\nof pride and benignity, as he looked down on the multitude below. The\r\ncompany ascended to the foot of the throne, where they all kneeled for\r\nsome minutes; then they rose and passed round to the side of the\r\npedestal upon which the throne stood. Here they crowded close behind\r\nthe youth, putting him in the foremost place, and one of them opened a\r\ndoor in the pedestal, for the youth to enter. I was sure I saw him\r\nshrink back, and those crowding behind pushed him in. Then, again,\r\narose a burst of song from the multitude in white, which lasted some\r\ntime. When it ceased, a new company of seven commenced its march up the\r\ncentre. As they advanced, I looked up at my master: his noble\r\ncountenance was full of reverence and awe. Incapable of evil himself,\r\nhe could scarcely suspect it in another, much less in a multitude such\r\nas this, and surrounded with such appearances of solemnity. I was\r\ncertain it was the really grand accompaniments that overcame him; that\r\nthe stars overhead, the dark towering tops of the yew-trees, and the\r\nwind that, like an unseen spirit, sighed through their branches, bowed\r\nhis spirit to the belief, that in all these ceremonies lay some great\r\nmystical meaning which, his humility told him, his ignorance prevented\r\nhim from understanding.\r\n\r\nMore convinced than before, that there was evil here, I could not\r\nendure that my master should be deceived; that one like him, so pure\r\nand noble, should respect what, if my suspicions were true, was worse\r\nthan the ordinary deceptions of priestcraft. I could not tell how far\r\nhe might be led to countenance, and otherwise support their doings,\r\nbefore he should find cause to repent bitterly of his error. I watched\r\nthe new procession yet more keenly, if possible, than the former. This\r\ntime, the central figure was a girl; and, at the close, I observed, yet\r\nmore indubitably, the shrinking back, and the crowding push. What\r\nhappened to the victims, I never learned; but I had learned enough, and\r\nI could bear it no longer. I stooped, and whispered to the young girl\r\nwho stood by me, to lend me her white garment. I wanted it, that I\r\nmight not be entirely out of keeping with the solemnity, but might have\r\nat least this help to passing unquestioned. She looked up, half-amused\r\nand half-bewildered, as if doubting whether I was in earnest or not.\r\nBut in her perplexity, she permitted me to unfasten it, and slip it\r\ndown from her shoulders.\r\n\r\nI easily got possession of it; and, sinking down on my knees in the\r\ncrowd, I rose apparently in the habit of one of the worshippers.\r\n\r\nGiving my battle-axe to the girl, to hold in pledge for the return of\r\nher stole, for I wished to test the matter unarmed, and, if it was a\r\nman that sat upon the throne, to attack him with hands bare, as I\r\nsupposed his must be, I made my way through the crowd to the front,\r\nwhile the singing yet continued, desirous of reaching the platform\r\nwhile it was unoccupied by any of the priests. I was permitted to walk\r\nup the long avenue of white robes unmolested, though I saw questioning\r\nlooks in many of the faces as I passed. I presume my coolness aided my\r\npassage; for I felt quite indifferent as to my own fate; not feeling,\r\nafter the late events of my history, that I was at all worth taking\r\ncare of; and enjoying, perhaps, something of an evil satisfaction, in\r\nthe revenge I was thus taking upon the self which had fooled me so\r\nlong. When I arrived on the platform, the song had just ceased, and I\r\nfelt as if all were looking towards me. But instead of kneeling at its\r\nfoot, I walked right up the stairs to the throne, laid hold of a great\r\nwooden image that seemed to sit upon it, and tried to hurl it from its\r\nseat. In this I failed at first, for I found it firmly fixed. But in\r\ndread lest, the first shock of amazement passing away, the guards would\r\nrush upon me before I had effected my purpose, I strained with all my\r\nmight; and, with a noise as of the cracking, and breaking, and tearing\r\nof rotten wood, something gave way, and I hurled the image down the\r\nsteps. Its displacement revealed a great hole in the throne, like the\r\nhollow of a decayed tree, going down apparently a great way. But I had\r\nno time to examine it, for, as I looked into it, up out of it rushed a\r\ngreat brute, like a wolf, but twice the size, and tumbled me headlong\r\nwith itself, down the steps of the throne. As we fell, however, I\r\ncaught it by the throat, and the moment we reached the platform, a\r\nstruggle commenced, in which I soon got uppermost, with my hand upon\r\nits throat, and knee upon its heart. But now arose a wild cry of wrath\r\nand revenge and rescue. A universal hiss of steel, as every sword was\r\nswept from its scabbard, seemed to tear the very air in shreds. I heard\r\nthe rush of hundreds towards the platform on which I knelt. I only\r\ntightened my grasp of the brute\xe2\x80\x99s throat. His eyes were already\r\nstarting from his head, and his tongue was hanging out. My anxious hope\r\nwas, that, even after they had killed me, they would be unable to undo\r\nmy gripe of his throat, before the monster was past breathing. I\r\ntherefore threw all my will, and force, and purpose, into the grasping\r\nhand. I remember no blow. A faintness came over me, and my\r\nconsciousness departed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are ne\xe2\x80\x99er like angels till our passions die.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n          DECKAR.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis wretched _Inn_, where we scarce stay to bait,\r\n        We call our _Dwelling-Place_:\r\n        We call one _Step a Race_:\r\nBut angels in their full enlightened state,\r\nAngels, who _Live_, and know what \xe2\x80\x98tis to _Be_,\r\nWho all the nonsense of our language see,\r\nWho speak _things_, and our _words_, their ill-drawn _pictures_, scorn,\r\n    When we, by a foolish figure, say,\r\n    _Behold an old man dead!_ then they\r\nSpeak properly, and cry, _Behold a man-child born!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n          COWLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nI was dead, and right content. I lay in my coffin, with my hands folded\r\nin peace. The knight, and the lady I loved, wept over me.\r\n\r\nHer tears fell on my face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said the knight, \xe2\x80\x9cI rushed amongst them like a madman. I hewed\r\nthem down like brushwood. Their swords battered on me like hail, but\r\nhurt me not. I cut a lane through to my friend. He was dead. But he had\r\nthrottled the monster, and I had to cut the handful out of its throat,\r\nbefore I could disengage and carry off his body. They dared not molest\r\nme as I brought him back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has died well,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady.\r\n\r\nMy spirit rejoiced. They left me to my repose. I felt as if a cool hand\r\nhad been laid upon my heart, and had stilled it. My soul was like a\r\nsummer evening, after a heavy fall of rain, when the drops are yet\r\nglistening on the trees in the last rays of the down-going sun, and the\r\nwind of the twilight has begun to blow. The hot fever of life had gone\r\nby, and I breathed the clear mountain-air of the land of Death. I had\r\nnever dreamed of such blessedness. It was not that I had in any way\r\nceased to be what I had been. The very fact that anything can die,\r\nimplies the existence of something that cannot die; which must either\r\ntake to itself another form, as when the seed that is sown dies, and\r\narises again; or, in conscious existence, may, perhaps, continue to\r\nlead a purely spiritual life. If my passions were dead, the souls of\r\nthe passions, those essential mysteries of the spirit which had\r\nimbodied themselves in the passions, and had given to them all their\r\nglory and wonderment, yet lived, yet glowed, with a pure, undying fire.\r\nThey rose above their vanishing earthly garments, and disclosed\r\nthemselves angels of light. But oh, how beautiful beyond the old form!\r\nI lay thus for a time, and lived as it were an unradiating existence;\r\nmy soul a motionless lake, that received all things and gave nothing\r\nback; satisfied in still contemplation, and spiritual consciousness.\r\n\r\nEre long, they bore me to my grave. Never tired child lay down in his\r\nwhite bed, and heard the sound of his playthings being laid aside for\r\nthe night, with a more luxurious satisfaction of repose than I knew,\r\nwhen I felt the coffin settle on the firm earth, and heard the sound of\r\nthe falling mould upon its lid. It has not the same hollow rattle\r\nwithin the coffin, that it sends up to the edge of the grave. They\r\nburied me in no graveyard. They loved me too much for that, I thank\r\nthem; but they laid me in the grounds of their own castle, amid many\r\ntrees; where, as it was spring-time, were growing primroses, and\r\nblue-bells, and all the families of the woods\r\n\r\nNow that I lay in her bosom, the whole earth, and each of her many\r\nbirths, was as a body to me, at my will. I seemed to feel the great\r\nheart of the mother beating into mine, and feeding me with her own\r\nlife, her own essential being and nature. I heard the footsteps of my\r\nfriends above, and they sent a thrill through my heart. I knew that the\r\nhelpers had gone, and that the knight and the lady remained, and spoke\r\nlow, gentle, tearful words of him who lay beneath the yet wounded sod.\r\nI rose into a single large primrose that grew by the edge of the grave,\r\nand from the window of its humble, trusting face, looked full in the\r\ncountenance of the lady. I felt that I could manifest myself in the\r\nprimrose; that it said a part of what I wanted to say; just as in the\r\nold time, I had used to betake myself to a song for the same end. The\r\nflower caught her eye. She stooped and plucked it, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, you\r\nbeautiful creature!\xe2\x80\x9d and, lightly kissing it, put it in her bosom. It\r\nwas the first kiss she had ever given me. But the flower soon began to\r\nwither, and I forsook it.\r\n\r\nIt was evening. The sun was below the horizon; but his rosy beams yet\r\nilluminated a feathery cloud, that floated high above the world. I\r\narose, I reached the cloud; and, throwing myself upon it, floated with\r\nit in sight of the sinking sun. He sank, and the cloud grew gray; but\r\nthe grayness touched not my heart. It carried its rose-hue within; for\r\nnow I could love without needing to be loved again. The moon came\r\ngliding up with all the past in her wan face. She changed my couch into\r\na ghostly pallor, and threw all the earth below as to the bottom of a\r\npale sea of dreams. But she could not make me sad. I knew now, that it\r\nis by loving, and not by being loved, that one can come nearest the\r\nsoul of another; yea, that, where two love, it is the loving of each\r\nother, and not the being loved by each other, that originates and\r\nperfects and assures their blessedness. I knew that love gives to him\r\nthat loveth, power over any soul beloved, even if that soul know him\r\nnot, bringing him inwardly close to that spirit; a power that cannot be\r\nbut for good; for in proportion as selfishness intrudes, the love\r\nceases, and the power which springs therefrom dies. Yet all love will,\r\none day, meet with its return. All true love will, one day, behold its\r\nown image in the eyes of the beloved, and be humbly glad. This is\r\npossible in the realms of lofty Death. \xe2\x80\x9cAh! my friends,\xe2\x80\x9d thought I,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chow I will tend you, and wait upon you, and haunt you with my love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy floating chariot bore me over a great city. Its faint dull sound\r\nsteamed up into the air\xe2\x80\x94a sound\xe2\x80\x94how composed? \xe2\x80\x9cHow many hopeless\r\ncries,\xe2\x80\x9d thought I, \xe2\x80\x9cand how many mad shouts go to make up the tumult,\r\nhere so faint where I float in eternal peace, knowing that they will\r\none day be stilled in the surrounding calm, and that despair dies into\r\ninfinite hope, and the seeming impossible there, is the law here!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, O pale-faced women, and gloomy-browed men, and forgotten\r\nchildren, how I will wait on you, and minister to you, and, putting my\r\narms about you in the dark, think hope into your hearts, when you fancy\r\nno one is near! Soon as my senses have all come back, and have grown\r\naccustomed to this new blessed life, I will be among you with the love\r\nthat healeth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith this, a pang and a terrible shudder went through me; a writhing as\r\nof death convulsed me; and I became once again conscious of a more\r\nlimited, even a bodily and earthly life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur life is no dream; but it ought to become one, and perhaps will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n          NOVALIS.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd on the ground, which is my modres gate,\r\nI knocke with my staf; erlich and late,\r\nAnd say to hire, Leve mother, let me in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n          CHAUCER, _The Pardoneres Tale_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSinking from such a state of ideal bliss, into the world of shadows\r\nwhich again closed around and infolded me, my first dread was, not\r\nunnaturally, that my own shadow had found me again, and that my torture\r\nhad commenced anew. It was a sad revulsion of feeling. This, indeed,\r\nseemed to correspond to what we think death is, before we die. Yet I\r\nfelt within me a power of calm endurance to which I had hitherto been a\r\nstranger. For, in truth, that I should be able if only to think such\r\nthings as I had been thinking, was an unspeakable delight. An hour of\r\nsuch peace made the turmoil of a lifetime worth striving through.\r\n\r\nI found myself lying in the open air, in the early morning, before\r\nsunrise. Over me rose the summer heaven, expectant of the sun. The\r\nclouds already saw him, coming from afar; and soon every dewdrop would\r\nrejoice in his individual presence within it.\r\n\r\nI lay motionless for a few minutes; and then slowly rose and looked\r\nabout me. I was on the summit of a little hill; a valley lay beneath,\r\nand a range of mountains closed up the view upon that side. But, to my\r\nhorror, across the valley, and up the height of the opposing mountains,\r\nstretched, from my very feet, a hugely expanding shade. There it lay,\r\nlong and large, dark and mighty. I turned away with a sick despair;\r\nwhen lo! I beheld the sun just lifting his head above the eastern hill,\r\nand the shadow that fell from me, lay only where his beams fell not. I\r\ndanced for joy. It was only the natural shadow, that goes with every\r\nman who walks in the sun. As he arose, higher and higher, the\r\nshadow-head sank down the side of the opposite hill, and crept in\r\nacross the valley towards my feet.\r\n\r\nNow that I was so joyously delivered from this fear, I saw and\r\nrecognised the country around me. In the valley below, lay my own\r\ncastle, and the haunts of my childhood were all about me hastened home.\r\nMy sisters received me with unspeakable joy; but I suppose they\r\nobserved some change in me, for a kind of respect, with a slight touch\r\nof awe in it, mingled with their joy, and made me ashamed. They had\r\nbeen in great distress about me. On the morning of my disappearance,\r\nthey had found the floor of my room flooded; and, all that day, a\r\nwondrous and nearly impervious mist had hung about the castle and\r\ngrounds. I had been gone, they told me, twenty-one days. To me it\r\nseemed twenty-one years. Nor could I yet feel quite secure in my new\r\nexperiences. When, at night, I lay down once more in my own bed, I did\r\nnot feel at all sure that when I awoke, I should not find myself in\r\nsome mysterious region of Fairy Land. My dreams were incessant and\r\nperturbed; but when I did awake, I saw clearly that I was in my own\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nMy mind soon grew calm; and I began the duties of my new position,\r\nsomewhat instructed, I hoped, by the adventures that had befallen me in\r\nFairy Land. Could I translate the experience of my travels there, into\r\ncommon life? This was the question. Or must I live it all over again,\r\nand learn it all over again, in the other forms that belong to the\r\nworld of men, whose experience yet runs parallel to that of Fairy Land?\r\nThese questions I cannot answer yet. But I fear.\r\n\r\nEven yet, I find myself looking round sometimes with anxiety, to see\r\nwhether my shadow falls right away from the sun or no. I have never yet\r\ndiscovered any inclination to either side. And if I am not unfrequently\r\nsad, I yet cast no more of a shade on the earth, than most men who have\r\nlived in it as long as I. I have a strange feeling sometimes, that I am\r\na ghost, sent into the world to minister to my fellow men, or, rather,\r\nto repair the wrongs I have already done.\r\n\r\nMay the world be brighter for me, at least in those portions of it,\r\nwhere my darkness falls not.\r\n\r\nThus I, who set out to find my Ideal, came back rejoicing that I had\r\nlost my Shadow.\r\n\r\nWhen the thought of the blessedness I experienced, after my death in\r\nFairy Land, is too high for me to lay hold upon it and hope in it, I\r\noften think of the wise woman in the cottage, and of her solemn\r\nassurance that she knew something too good to be told. When I am\r\noppressed by any sorrow or real perplexity, I often feel as if I had\r\nonly left her cottage for a time, and would soon return out of the\r\nvision, into it again. Sometimes, on such occasions, I find myself,\r\nunconsciously almost, looking about for the mystic mark of red, with\r\nthe vague hope of entering her door, and being comforted by her wise\r\ntenderness. I then console myself by saying: \xe2\x80\x9cI have come through the\r\ndoor of Dismay; and the way back from the world into which that has led\r\nme, is through my tomb. Upon that the red sign lies, and I shall find\r\nit one day, and be glad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI will end my story with the relation of an incident which befell me a\r\nfew days ago. I had been with my reapers, and, when they ceased their\r\nwork at noon, I had lain down under the shadow of a great, ancient\r\nbeech-tree, that stood on the edge of the field. As I lay, with my eyes\r\nclosed, I began to listen to the sound of the leaves overhead. At\r\nfirst, they made sweet inarticulate music alone; but, by-and-by, the\r\nsound seemed to begin to take shape, and to be gradually moulding\r\nitself into words; till, at last, I seemed able to distinguish these,\r\nhalf-dissolved in a little ocean of circumfluent tones: \xe2\x80\x9cA great good\r\nis coming\xe2\x80\x94is coming\xe2\x80\x94is coming to thee, Anodos;\xe2\x80\x9d and so over and over\r\nagain. I fancied that the sound reminded me of the voice of the ancient\r\nwoman, in the cottage that was four-square. I opened my eyes, and, for\r\na moment, almost believed that I saw her face, with its many wrinkles\r\nand its young eyes, looking at me from between two hoary branches of\r\nthe beech overhead. But when I looked more keenly, I saw only twigs and\r\nleaves, and the infinite sky, in tiny spots, gazing through between.\r\nYet I know that good is coming to me\xe2\x80\x94that good is always coming; though\r\nfew have at all times the simplicity and the courage to believe it.\r\nWhat we call evil, is the only and best shape, which, for the person\r\nand his condition at the time, could be assumed by the best good. And\r\nso, _Farewell_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK PHANTASTES ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 325-0.txt or 325-0.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n    https://www.gutenberg.org/3/2/325/\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
